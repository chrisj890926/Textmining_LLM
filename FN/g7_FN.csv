22,2," In light of the decision reached today in the instant case, we need not discuss assignments of error (1) and (3). "
23,3," Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1, provides: ""Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or 
conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal. Every 
person who shall make any contract or engage in any combination or conspiracy hereby declared to be illegal shall be deemed 
guilty of a felony, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding $10,000,000 if a corporation, or, if any 
other person, $350,000, or by imprisonment not exceeding three years, or by both said punishments, in the discretion of the 
court."" The section of the Sherman Act that applies to Puerto Rico is sec. 3. The wording of this section is similar to the above-
cited sec. 1."

23,7," Some examples of state intervention in our economy are: (1) the act that regulates the operation of business establishments 
(our current Closing Law), Act No. 1 of December 1, 1989, as amended, 29 L.P.R.A. § 301 et seq.; (2) the act that regulates

vested in the Department of Consumer Affairs (D.A.Co.) to fix prices, Act No. 5 of April 23, 1973 (3 L.P.R.A. § 341 et seq.)."
23,8," In P.R. Fuels, Inc. v. Empire Gas Co., Inc., 149 D.P.R. at 708 [49 P.R. Offic. Trans. at    ], this Court, citing Pressure Vessels 
P.R. v. Empire Gas P.R., 137 D.P.R. at 508 [37 P.R. Offic. Trans, at    ], stated that one of the fundamental objectives of the 
Antitrust Act was ""[t]o provide a flexible basis for the application of the law itself, based on a standard of reasonableness that 
would allow our courts to take into consideration the particular characteristics and needs of our economy, as well as the 
government plans and private sector activities for putting it into practice."" Joint Report of the House Standing Committees on 
Judicial Matters, the Treasury, and Commerce and Industry, supra, at 1425-1426. "
24,9," Since Puerto Rico's economy is highly regulated, price fixing by the government is not surprising and is even indispensable 
sometimes for striking a balance in weaker areas of our economy. See the Department of Consumer Affairs Organic Act, n.7."

24,11," In the case of (a) tying arrangements, (b) reciprocal dealing, and (c) group boycotts, courts will apply the per se rule, but only if 
certain elements are shown, such as coercion, or if it is apparent on a quick look that one of the businesses has substantially 
more market power than the other. 1 Julian O. von Kalinowski, Peter Sullivan, and Maureen McGuirl, Antitrust Laws and Trade 
Regulations § 12.01, at 12-3. "
25,12," It bears mentioning that a third, hybrid test for unreasonableness has been developed in the federal jurisdiction in which proof 
of market power is not required. FTC v. Indiana Federation of Dentists, 476 U.S. 447 (1986). Von Kalinowski, supra, at 12-15. In 
NCAA v. Board of Regents of the Univ. of Okla., 468 U.S. 85 (1984), the United States Supreme Court held that where a naked 
restriction on price or output is involved, proof of market power is not essential. In other words, the possible violation of antitrust 
laws was so obvious that without having to apply the per se rule or a complex and lengthy rule of reason inquiry, the controversy 
could be adjudicated by summarily applying the rule of reason; the beneficial, harmful, or alternate effects of such a restraint on 
trade could be summarily detected and balanced. 7 Phillip E. Areeda, Antitrust Law: An Analysis of Antitrust Principles and 
Their Application 403 (1986). This doctrine is known as the ""truncated rule of reason."" This method cannot be employed in the case under our consideration because the necessary balance to analyze the restraint 
cannot be made on the basis of the pleadings and accompanying documents."
25,13," For the traditional 1940 view—which banned, as a rule, all kinds of restraint—see U.S. v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. 
150 (1940). This view began to change in the 1970's with the decision in Broadcast Music, Inc. v. CBS, 441 U.S. 1 (1979), and in 
the 1980's with NCAA v. Board of Regents of Univ. of Okla., 468 U.S. 85 (1984). In the 1990's, however, the trend followed 
when applying the doctrines was somewhat uncertain in cases in which the court employed a traditional view, such as FTC v. 
Superior Court Trial Lawyers Assn., 493 U.S. 411 (1990), and in cases in which the court was more flexible, such as State Oil 
Co. v. Khan, 522 U.S. 3 (1997). "
26,14," Since the end of the 19th century, the United States Supreme Court has held that a noncompetition agreement that operates 
when one of the companies involved in the agreement is sold should not be judged under the per se rule. Addyston Pipe & Steel 
Co. v. United States, 175 U.S. 211 (1899). In the middle of the 20th century, the United States Supreme Court extended the 
application of the above pronouncements regarding noncompetition agreements when employment contracts are involved. 
Schine Theatres v. United States, 334 U.S. 110 (1948) (overruled on other grounds); Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube 
Corp., 467 U.S. 752 (1984). For the treatment in our jurisdiction of noncompetition clauses in employment contracts, see Arthur 
Young & Co. v. Vega III, 136 D.P.R. 157 [36 P.R. Offic. Trans.    ] (1994)."
26,15," When the effects of a particular agreement are not clear, the court should hesitate to apply the per se rule, especially when the 
effect of the challenged restraint cannot be assessed. See Northwest Stationers v. Pacific Stationery, All U.S. 284, 294-298 
(1985). Von Kalinowski, supra, at 14-10."
26,16," In fact, there are several references on record to the high competitiveness of ""that market."" One of these references is found in 
the letter sent by General Gases to Guillermety on September 21, 1990, which states: ""We understand and acknowledge your 
costs, as well as the fierce competition existing in this field ..."" [Exhibit 8 of the Petition for Certiorari at 111.] In the Motion for 
Summary Judgment, at 8, General Gases stated: ""[S]ince then, General Gases has been an active competitor in this market 
together with other companies engaged in the same line of business."" In the Pretrial Conference Report, at 7, Shoring refers to 
that industry as one ""of the most competitive in Puerto Rico."" "
35,1, The facts are undisputed unless otherwise noted. 
37,2," ""'Affiliates' is defined as RPR and Persons 'directly or indirectly controlled by RPR.'"" Watson's UF P 27. ""'Control' means 'the 
direct or indirect ownership of over 50% of the outstanding voting securities of a Person, or the right to receive over 50% of the 
profits or earnings of a Person.'"" Watson's UF P 28. Defendants do not dispute the contract terms but argue that they ""expressly 
limited the scope of 'affiliate' to exclude from its reach RPR's European parent[, Rhone-Poulenc, S.A. (or 'RPSA')] because RPR 
could not bind its parent and was not apprised of the parent's future plans."" RPR's SGI P 27."
37,3," At the time the License Agreement was executed, there were three branded diltiazem products available: Dilacor XR(R) to be 
distributed by Watson, Tiazac made by Forest Laboratories and Cardizem CD(R) made by Hoechst Marion Roussel, Inc. 
Cockburn Decl. P 5(b). In 1998, generic diltiazem appears to have been sold by Watson, Mylan and Andrx. Cockburn Decl. Ex. 
A at 15. In 1999, Apotex entered the generic diltiazem market and by 2000 Faulding and Teva had also entered that market. Id. "
38,4," RPR does not refute the truth of this statement, but it would add the following: ""This statement fails to mention that Watson was 
fully apprised of the terms of the Consent Decree before entering into the transaction to acquire the rights to the Dilacor 
Products. Watson received all of the information that Watson felt it needed about Centeon in the course of its due diligence and 
was 'satisfied' with Centeon's ability to manufacture the Dilacor products."" RPR's SGI P 14. "
40,5," The relevant agreements all contain a provision selecting New York substantive law as controlling any disputes ""relating to or 
arising out of"" each agreement. However, the Court analyzes the relevant contracts under California law because no party has 
suggested in the current motions that any other law is applicable. Both parties cite almost exclusively California law in their 
briefs. "
41,6," It is otherwise undisputed that, absent a defense, RPRPI breached the Supply Agreement by failing to supply Plaintiff with ""all 
of its requirements"" of Dilacor XR(R) for the duration of the Supply Agreement. See Watson's UF PP 22, 40; Gaut Decl. Vol. II 
Ex. 52, P 2.1. "
42,7," Even if the Centeon shutdown was ""beyond the reasonable control of either party,"" to qualify for the safe harbor of Article VIII, 
Defendants must further prove that they used ""commercially reasonable efforts to resume compliance with [the Supply] 
Agreement as soon as possible."" "
45,8," A ruling in Plaintiff's favor on this issue would also necessarily dispose of Defendants' counterclaim, which seeks a declaratory 
judgment that they are not in breach of the non-compete provisions. "
46,9," Defendants concede that ""Aventis Pharmaceuticals"" may be used broadly to refer to HMR and RPRPI. Def.'s Opp. at 12."
46,10," In light of this ruling, the Court need not address Plaintiff's alternative argument that Defendants' liability for breach of the non-
compete clause flows from agency and alter ego principles."
46,11," In the actual contract, the deleted language refers to any other entity acquired by Watson or RPPI. The provision at issue 
here, Paragraph 3.2(a) only restricted activities of RPPI or its ""Affiliates."" "
48,12," Defendants assert that ""section 17200 is not applicable to redress conduct amounting to nothing more than an alleged breach 
of contract."" Motion at 2:11-12. However, a breach of contract may in fact form the predicate for Section 17200 claims, provided 
it also constitutes conduct that is ""unlawful, or unfair, or fraudulent."" See Allied Grape Growers v. Bronco Wine Company, 203 
Cal. App. 3d 432, 249 Cal. Rptr. 872 (1988) (buyers' breach of contract to purchase grapes constituted unfair business practice 
under Section 17200). Defendants do not refute this case in their Reply. [This was footnote 3 in the October 21, 1999 Order.]"
48,13," Plaintiff is correct that the Cel-Tech test was expressly limited to actions between competitors. See 20 Cal. 4th at 187 n.12. 
Given that HMR was a competitor of Watson before Hoechst's merger with RPSA, and that the RPR parties effectively stepped 
into HMR's shoes -- i.e., became competitors of Watson -- the Court finds that the Cel-Tech test is applicable here. "
50,14," ""RPR supplied Watson with only five out of thirty-four pages of the FDA 483 issued to Centeon on July 10, 1998, and even 
those pages were redacted so that Watson could not tell how serious the problems at Centeon were. The July 10, 1998 Form 
483 contained 102 'observations', many of which had numerous subparts."" Watson's UF P 146. Defendants claim that the 
redacted version fully ""set forth the observations related to Dilacor XR(R)"" and, in any event, the complete document was 
publicly available from the FDA. RPR's SGI P 146. Moreover, argues RPR, it sent the complete and unredacted version of the 
FDA 483 observations to Watson's general counsel on September 14, 1998. Supp. Stone Decl. Ex. 2. "
51,15," In its opposition to this motion Plaintiff claims to be entitled to disgorgement in any event, as a remedy for Defendants' 
breaches of the Supply Agreement and/or License Agreement. This issue is beyond the scope of Defendants' motion, which only 
seeks to eliminate disgorgement as a possible remedy for the § 17200 claim. Accordingly, the Court declines to express any 
view on what remedies are available to Plaintiff on its breach of contract claims. At the hearing, Defendants' counsel requested 
an opportunity to submit new and additional briefs demonstrating that Plaintiff cannot recover for ""unjust enrichment"" nor recover 
disgorgement as a remedy for any other breach. Before any such permission will be granted, the parties must meet and confer 
and set forth their respective positions as to such recovery. If Plaintiff winds up claiming in good faith a basis for such recovery 
which Defendants in goof faith reject, then Defendants can file a carefully targeted motion in limine to preclude such effort."
51,16," Plaintiff argues that the non-compete provision in the License Agreement did confer a ""property interest"" in the profits reaped 
by Defendants on sales of Cardizem CD(R). The Court is not persuaded by that argument. The simple fact is that Cardizem 
CD(R) would have been available notwithstanding any violation of the non-compete clause. Though the non-compete clause 
makes it wrongful for any RPR entity to share in those profits, Plaintiff could not complain if there had been no merger and HMR 
had continued to profit from Cardizem CD(R). "
52,17," Apparently for purposes of this motion only, Defendants ask the Court to assume that Plaintiff properly exercised an option to 
extend the Supply Agreement for an additional year to June 30, 2000."
52,18," Defendants object to Hsia's declaration on several grounds including that it is impermissible opinion testimony and contains 
hearsay. The Court overrules those objections. First, Hsia testified on the basis of his own personal knowledge and extensive 
experience in Plaintiff's dealings with the FDA and his opinion is therefore helpful. See Fed.R.Evid. 701 Advisory Committee's 
Note to 2000 Amendments: ""For example, most courts have permitted the owner or officer of a business to testify to the value or 
projected profits of the business, without the necessity of qualifying the witness as an . . . expert. . . . Such opinion testimony is 
admitted not because of experience, training or specialized knowledge within the realm of an expert, but because of the 
particularized knowledge that the witness has by virtue of his or her position in the business."" Hsia's testimony is akin to that 
described in the Advisory Committee's Notes. Second, although the statement of FDA inspector Pacio that he would recommend 
approval lacks evidentiary significance given that approval was not in fact granted, the other factors Hsia mentions at PP 3-12 
provide sufficient support (at this stage) for a jury to find that Watson was not in fact incapable of obtaining approval. "
61,*," The Honorable Louis H. Pollak, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, sitting by designation. "
66,1," Several other courts prior to Brunswick held that employees barred from seeking employment from a third party employer 
because of a no-hire agreement have standing to litigate a § 1 claim. See, e.g., Radovich v. Nat'l Football League, 352 U.S. 445, 
1 L. Ed. 2d 456, 77 S. Ct. 390 (1957) (coach precluded from working in National Football League because of agreement among 
all of the teams in the league had standing); Quinonez v. Nat'l Assoc. of Secs. Dealers, Inc., 540 F.2d 824 (5th Cir. 1976) 
(plaintiff who was fired by securities dealer and was unable to find employment with another securities dealer because of 
agreement among dealer firms not to hire an employee who was discharged by another firm suffered sufficient injury to proceed 
with antitrust claim); Tugboat, Inc. v. Mobile Towing Co., 534 F.2d 1172, 1176 (5th Cir.) (""There can be little doubt that an 
employee who is deprived of a work opportunity has been injured . . . because the selling of one's labor is a commercial 
interest.""), reh'g denied, 540 F.2d 1085 (5th Cir. 1976); Nichols v. Spencer Int'l Press, Inc., 371 F.2d 332 (7th Cir. 1967) 
(plaintiff prohibited from seeking employment at competing employer because of agreement between employers in industry not 
to hire each other's employees suffered injury sufficient to bring antitrust claim). "
68,2," Similarly, we can find no cases in which a no-hire agreement entered into upon the sale of a business to a third party that 
resulted in the loss of employee benefits was found to be a horizontal price fixing conspiracy. See Broad. Music, Inc., 441 U.S. 
at 9-10 (quoting Topco Assocs., Inc., 405 U.S. at 607-08 (""It is only after considerable experience with certain business 
relationships that courts classify them as per se violations."")). "
69,3," Plaintiffs contend the true motive of the no-hire agreement was not work force continuity but eliminating pension benefits to 
reduce Texas Pacific Group's costs. They argue that if work force continuity were really the motive, Texas Pacific Group could 
have offered enhanced benefits packages to entice the work force to remain with Paradyne rather then simply agreeing to 
cancel their AT&T pension benefits. But the existence of alternative means to achieve a legitimate business goal does not in 
itself mean the defendants' chosen course of action was uncompetitive and improper. "
70,4," Plaintiffs argue they are under no obligation to define the relevant product and geographic markets because the defendants' 
conduct per se violated the antitrust laws. See Jefferson Parish Hosp. Dist. No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 15, 80 L. Ed. 2d 2, 104 S. 
Ct. 1551 (1984). Because we find this case is governed under the rule of reason, plaintiffs necessarily have the affirmative 
burden of proving the relevant product and geographic markets affected by the defendants' alleged uncompetitive activity.  Ideal 
Dairy Farms Inc. v. John LaBatt, Ltd., 90 F.3d 737, 743 (3d Cir. 1996) (holding plaintiffs must present evidence from which 
rational person could conclude the relevant markets are actually what plaintiffs allege them to be)."
70,5," As previously noted, the District Court found there are over twenty companies that compete for employees with plaintiffs' 
technical skills. Additionally there are a ""vast number of jobs"" nationwide for plaintiffs with more generalized work and 
educational experience. Eichorn, CA No. 96-3587, slip op. at *27-28 n.17."
70,6," Plaintiffs also attempt to characterize defendants' activity as an illegal exercise of relational market power. See Sullivan & 
Grimes, The Law of Antitrust: An Integrated Handbook § 2.4e2iv (2000); Warren S. Grimes, Market Definition in Antitrust Claims: "
71,," Relational Market Power and the Franchisor's Conflict of Interest, 67 Antitrust L.J. 243 (1999). They contend AT&T offered a 
unique pension benefits program that essentially locked the plaintiffs into working for them. See Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image 
Technical Services, 504 U.S. 451, 119 L. Ed. 2d 265, 112 S. Ct. 2072 (1992). Claiming that AT&T was the only 
telecommunications company within the industry that offered such an extensive benefits program, plaintiffs maintain they were 
prevented from seeking employment at any other company, since to do so would result in the loss of valuable pension benefits. 
According to this argument, the no-hire agreement that precluded plaintiffs from working at an AT&T affiliate prevented them 
from working at the only company within the industry where they could receive these unique benefits. See, e.g., Aspen Skiing 
Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., 472 U.S. 585, 86 L. Ed. 2d 467, 105 S. Ct. 2847 (1985); FTC v. Texaco, Inc., 393 U.S. 
223, 21 L. Ed. 2d 394, 89 S. Ct. 429 (1968). Central to plaintiffs' argument is the contention that the AT&T pension benefits are 
unique in the industry. We see no evidence for this in the record. Therefore, we need not address whether to extend the 
relational market power analysis to the facts of this case."
71,7," Although the no-hire agreement effectively cancelled the plaintiffs' AT&T benefits, these plaintiffs were free to seek employment 
elsewhere in the industry where pension benefits may have been available. But even though defendants' activity was not a price 
fixing conspiracy under the Sherman Act, it may give rise to liability under § 510 of ERISA where a different analysis is involved."
71,8," In their complaint plaintiffs did not allege that Texas Pacific Group violated § 510 of ERISA. App. at 92a, 157a (""Plaintiffs 
demand judgment . . . declaring the refusal of AT&T and Lucent to employ members of the Class until after the expiration of their 
pension bridging rights to be in violation of ERISA section 510, 29 U.S.C. § 1140.""). "
72,9," In its initial order granting summary judgment on the antitrust claims, the District Court found plaintiffs produced enough 
evidence to survive a motion for summary judgment on the ERISA claim. Upon reconsideration, the District Court reversed its 
position stating it improperly relied on circumstantial evidence that the defendants experienced an overall economic gain from 
the no-hire agreement and sale of Paradyne. In re-examining the relevant case law, the court said the proper inquiry should 
focus on the reduction in actual benefit expenses caused by the termination of employees, rather than a broader assessment of 
the overall financial impact of termination on the employer's business. See Clark v. Coats & Clark, 990 F.2d 1217, 1224 (11th 
Cir. 1993) (""Measures designed to reduce costs in general that also result in an incidental reduction in benefits expenses do not 
suggest discriminatory intent.""). We agree with the Eleventh Circuit. But we hold that plaintiffs have produced sufficient evidence 
that both AT&T and Lucent received a direct and substantial financial gain from the cancellation of pension benefits, namely they 
were relieved from paying large sums for the pension benefits of the several Paradyne employees affected by the agreement."
72,10," We believe a genuine issue of material fact exists only with the Pre and Post-Closing Nets' effect on the Paradyne employees' 
pension rights. Because the Preliminary Net did not prohibit plaintiffs from receiving their pension benefits as employees of 
Lucent Technologies, it did not violate § 510 of ERISA. "
98,1," See Notice of Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Personal Jurisdiction, Schedule A, and Notice of Motion and Joinder in the Motion 
to Dismiss the First Complaint for Lack of Personal Jurisdiction: see also Notice of Motion to Dismiss on the Grounds of Forum

Conveniens, attached to this opinion as Appendix 'A'. "
128,1, The facts as set forth herein are based on the district court's factual findings and the record material submitted by the parties.
128,2," Product volume in retail stores throughout the country is measured by the product's All Commodity Volume (ACV). Gerber's 
near 100 per cent ACV is impressive because virtually all supermarkets stock at most two brands of baby food. In at least one 
area of the country as many as 80 per cent of supermarket retailers stock only Gerber. "
129,3," Although Heinz and Beech-Nut introduced evidence showing that in areas that account for 80 of Beech-Nut sales, Heinz has a 
market share of about 2 and in areas that account for about 72 of Heinz sales, Beech-Nut's share is about 4, the FTC introduced 
evidence that Heinz and Beech-Nut are locked in an intense battle at the wholesale level to gain (and maintain) position as the 
second brand on retail shelves."
129,4," Section 18a requires pre-merger notification for a merger in which either the acquiring or the acquired firm has total net sales or 
assets of at least $ 10 million and the other firm has annual sales or total assets of at least $ 100 million. The acquirer must have 
at least 15 per cent or $ 15 million worth of the target firm's voting securities or assets.  15 U.S.C. § 18a(a). Filers must disclose 
specific financial and market data and pay a filing fee. "
130,5," HN8[
] Section 13(b) of the FTCA provides that ""upon a proper showing that, weighing the equities and considering the 
Commission's likelihood of ultimate success, such action would be in the public interest, … a preliminary injunction may be 
granted."" 15 U.S.C. § 53(b). "
131,6," In Beatrice Foods, two members of the court, writing separately from a denial of en banc review, included the quoted language 
from an unpublished judgment and memorandum issued earlier in the litigation."
131,7," HN11[
] To rebut the defendants may rely on ""nonstatistical evidence which casts doubt on the persuasive quality of the 
statistics to predict future anticompetitive consequences"" such as ""ease of entry into the market, the trend of the market either 
toward or away from concentration, and the continuation of active price competition."" Kaiser Aluminum & Chem. Corp. v. FTC, 
652 F.2d 1324, 1341 (7th Cir. 1981). In addition, the defendants may demonstrate unique economic circumstances that 
undermine the predictive value of the government's statistics. See United States v. General Dynamics Corp., 415 U.S. 486, 506-
10, 39 L. Ed. 2d 530, 94 S. Ct. 1186 (1974) (fundamental changes in structure of coal market made market concentration 
statistics inaccurate predictors of anticompetitive effect); see also University Health, 938 F.2d at 1218. "
132,8," A ""horizontal merger"" involves firms selling the same or similar products in a common geographical market."
132,9," ""The FTC and the Department of Justice, as well as most economists, consider the measure superior to such cruder measures 
as the four-or eight-firm concentration ratios which merely sum up the market shares of the largest four or eight firms."" PPG, 798 
F.2d at 1503. The Department of Justice and the FTC rely on the HHI in evaluating proposed horizontal mergers. See United 
States Dep't of Justice & Federal Trade Comm'n, Horizontal Merger Guidelines §§ 1.5, 1.51 (1992), as revised (1997). The HHI 
is calculated by totaling the squares of the market shares of every firm in the relevant market. For example, a market with ten 
firms having market shares of 20, 17, 13, 12, 10, 10, 8, 5, 3 and 2 has an HHI of 1304 (202 + 172 + 132 + 122 + 102 + 102 + 82 
+ 52 +32 +22). If the firms with 13 and 5 market shares were to merge, the HHI would increase by 130 points, expressed by the 
formula 2ab, which is derived from (a+b)2 or a2 + 2ab + b2. Under the Merger Guidelines a market with a postmerger HHI above 
1800 is considered ""highly concentrated"" and mergers that increase the HHI in such a market by over 50 points ""potentially raise 
significant competitive concerns."" Id. at § 1.51. Mergers ""producing an increase in the HHI of more than 100 points [in such 
markets] are [presumed] likely to create or enhance market power or facilitate its exercise."" Id. Although the Merger Guidelines 
are not binding on the court, they provide ""a useful illustration of the application of the HHI."" PPG, 798 F.2d at 1503 n.4."
132,10," To determine the HHI score the district court first had to define the relevant market. The court defined the product market as 
jarred baby food and the geographic market as the United States. H.J. Heinz, 116 F. Supp. 2d at 195. The parties do not 
challenge the court's definition."
132,11," The FTC argues that this finding alone--that it is certain to establish a prima facie case--entitles it to preliminary injunctive relief 
under PPG. We disagree with the Commission's reading of PPG. In PPG, the Commission appealed the district court's denial of 
its request for a preliminary injunction to prevent PPG Industries, the world's largest producer of glass aircraft transparencies, 
from acquiring Swedlow, Inc., the world's largest manufacturer of acrylic aircraft transparencies.  798 F.2d at 1502. After defining 
the relevant market and determining market share, the district court found that the merger would significantly increase the 
concentration in an already highly concentrated market. It also ""found high market-entry barriers that would prolong high market 
concentration."" Id. at 1503. On appeal, this court stated: ""There is no doubt that the pre-and post-acquisition HHI's and market 
shares found in this case entitle the Commission to some preliminary relief."" Id. This statement came, however, in the context of 
a case in which the appellants offered no rebuttal (other than the observation of rapid and continuing technological changes in 
the industry) to the presumption generated by the market concentration data on which the FTC based its prima facie showing. Id. 
at 1506. The court then noted the rule established in Weyerhaeuser that the FTC is entitled to a ""presumption in favor of a 
preliminary injunction when [it] establishes a strong likelihood of success on the merits."" Id. at 1507."
132,12," The Supreme Court has cautioned that statistics reflecting market share and concentration, while of great significance, are not 
conclusive indicators of anticompetitive effects. See General Dynamics, 415 U.S. at 498; Brown Shoe, 370 U.S. at 322 n.38 
(""Statistics reflecting the shares of the market controlled by the industry leaders and the parties to the merger are, of course, the "
133,," primary index of market power; but only a further examination of the particular market--its structure, history and probable future--
can provide the appropriate setting for judging the probable anticompetitive effect of the merger.""). In General Dynamics the 
Supreme Court held that the market share statistics the Commission used to seek divestiture of the merged firm were insufficient 
because, in failing to take into account the acquired firm's long-term contractual commitments (coal contracts), the statistics 
overestimated the acquired firm's ability to compete in the relevant market in the future.  General Dynamics, 415 U.S. at 500-
504."
133,13," Barriers to entry are important in evaluating whether market concentration statistics accurately reflect the pre- and likely post-
merger competitive picture. Cf.  Baker Hughes, 908 F.2d at 987. HN13[
] If entry barriers are low, the threat of outside entry 
can significantly alter the anticompetitive effects of the merger by deterring the remaining entities from colluding or exercising 
market power. See United States v. Falstaff Brewing Corp., 410 U.S. 526, 532-33, 35 L. Ed. 2d 475, 93 S. Ct. 1096 (1973); 
Baker Hughes, 908 F.2d at 987 (""In the absence of significant barriers, a company probably cannot maintain supracompetitive 
pricing for any length of time.""); Horizontal Merger Guidelines, supra, § 3.0 (""A merger is not likely to create or enhance market 
power or to facilitate its exercise, if entry into the market is so easy that market participants, after the merger, either collectively 
or unilaterally could not profitably maintain a price increase above premerger levels.""). Low barriers to entry enable a potential 
competitor to deter anticompetitive behavior by firms within the market simply by its ability to enter the market.  FTC v. Procter & 
Gamble Co., 386 U.S. 568, 581, 18 L. Ed. 2d 303, 87 S. Ct. 1224 (1967) (""It is clear that the existence of Procter at the edge of 
the industry exerted considerable influence on the market.""). Existing firms know that if they collude or exercise market power to 
charge supracompetitive prices, entry by firms currently not competing in the market becomes likely, thereby increasing the 
pressure on them to act competitively. See Baker Hughes, 908 F.2d at 988; Byars v. Bluff City News Co., 609 F.2d 843, 851 
n.19 (6th Cir. 1979). "
134,14," There are at least ten metropolitan areas in which Heinz and Beech-Nut both have more than a 10 per cent market share and 
their combined share exceeds 35 per cent. PX 781 at Ex. 1B."
134,15," Interchangeability of use and cross-elasticity of demand look to the availability of products that are similar in nature or use and 
the degree to which buyers are willing to substitute those similar products for one another. See E.I. du Pont de Nemours, 351 
U.S. at 393."
134,16," Fixed trade spending consists of ""slotting fees,"" ""pay-to-stay"" arrangements, new store allowances and other payments to 
retailers in exchange for shelf space and desired product display.  H.J. Heinz, 116 F. Supp. 2d at 197. Variable trade spending 
includes payments to retailers tied to sales volume and intended to insure a specific sales volume and lower shelf price. Id. "
135,17," Although the merger's effects on the wholesale market for baby food are important to a determination of whether the merger is 
likely to reduce competition in the baby food market overall, we reject the FTC's argument here that the ""wholesale competition"" 
between Heinz and Beech-Nut is an entirely distinct ""line of commerce"" within the meaning of section 7 of the Clayton Act such 
that it must be analyzed independently from ""retail competition."" The Congress amended section 7 in 1950 ""to make the 
measure of anticompetitive acquisitions the extent to which they lessened competition 'in any line of commerce,' rather than the 
extent to which they lessened competition 'between' the two companies."" Citizen Publishing Co. v. United States, 394 U.S. 131, 
137 n.3, 22 L. Ed. 2d 148, 89 S. Ct. 927 (1969). Courts interpret ""line of commerce"" as synonymous with the relevant product 
market. See General Dynamics, 415 U.S. at 510; Falstaff Brewing, 410 U.S. at 531-32. The district court defined only one 
market--jarred baby food sold throughout the line of commerce in the United States. Thus, the proper ""line of commerce"" for 
analysis in this case is the overall market for jarred baby food, which includes both retail and wholesale levels. At this point in the 
proceedings, the wholesale market cannot be separated out for analysis without regard to the merger's effect on other levels of 
competition."
135,18," In Procter & Gamble Co., 386 U.S. at 580, the Supreme Court stated that ""HN17[
] possible economies cannot be used as a 
defense to illegality"" in section 7 merger cases. The issue is, however, not a closed book. See Staples, 970 F. Supp. at 1088 
(collecting cases). Areeda and Turner explain that ""in interpreting the Clorox language, moreover, observe that the court referred 
only to 'possible' economies and to economies that 'may' result from mergers that lessen competition. To reject an economies 
defense based on mere possibilities does not mean that one should reject such a defense based on more convincing proof."" 4 
Phillip Areeda & Donald Turner, Antitrust Law P 941b, at 154 (1980). They conclude that ""the Court's brief and unelaborated 
language [in Clorox] cannot reasonably be taken as a definitive disposition of so important and complex an issue as the role of 
economies in analyzing legality of a merger."" Id. "
136,19," In addition, the district court described Heinz's distribution network as much more efficient than Beech-Nut's.  H.J. Heinz, 116 
F. Supp. 2d at 199. It failed to find, however, a significant diseconomy of scale in distribution from which either Heinz or Beech-
Nut suffers. 4A Areeda, et al., supra, P 975e1, at 73. In other words, although Beech-Nut has an inefficient distribution system, it 
can make that system more efficient without merger. Heinz's own efficient distribution network illustrates that a firm the size of 
Beech-Nut does not need to merge in order to attain an efficient distribution system."
136,20," The Horizontal Merger Guidelines explain that ""merging firms must substantiate efficiency claims so that the Agency can verify 
by reasonable means the likelihood and magnitude of each asserted efficiency, how and when each would be achieved (and any 
costs of doing so), how each would enhance the merged firm's ability and incentive to compete, and why each would be merger-
specific. Efficiency claims will not be considered if they are vague or speculative or otherwise cannot be verified by reasonable 
means."" Horizontal Merger Guidelines, supra, § 4. Regarding the types of efficiencies asserted here, the Guidelines state: The Agency has found that certain types of efficiencies are more likely to be cognizable and substantial than others. For 
example, efficiencies resulting from shifting production among facilities formerly owned separately, which enable the 
merging firms to reduce the marginal cost of production, are more likely to be susceptible to verification, merger-specific, 
and substantial, and are less likely to result from anticompetitive reductions in output. Other efficiencies, such as those 
relating to research and development, are potentially substantial but are generally less susceptible to verification and may 
be the result of anticompetitive output reductions. Yet others, such as those relating to procurement, management, or 
capital cost are less likely to be merger-specific or substantial, or may not be cognizable for other reasons. "

137,21," For example, a 5 cent piece of bubble gum introduced with a 90 ACV could appear as a failure on the graph because of low 
revenue but nonetheless be profitable. On the other hand, a high priced grocery product introduced with the same ACV could 
generate a lot of revenue (and thus appear as a ""success"" on the graph) yet be unprofitable."
137,22," The graph evidence is also not useful unless we know the ""sunk"" costs in bringing the product to market and the 
manufacturer's fixed and variable costs in producing the product. Sunk costs are costs that have already been incurred such as 
research and development and promotional expenses, including brand name development. See Henry N. Butler, Economic 
Analysis for Lawyers 935 (1998). Fixed costs refer to those expenses that do not vary with output and will be incurred as long as 
the firm continues in business. Variable costs are those that change with the rate of output such as wages paid to workers and "
138,," payments for raw materials. See id. at 920, 936; E. Thomas Sullivan & Jeffrey L. Harrison, Understanding Antitrust and its 
Economic Implications 19-21 (3d ed. 1998)."
138,23," HN19[
] In an oligopolistic market characterized by few producers, price leadership occurs when firms engage in 
interdependent pricing, setting their prices at a profit-maximizing, supracompetitive level by recognizing their shared economic 
interests with respect to price and output decisions. See Brooke Group Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 509 U.S. 
209, 227, 125 L. Ed. 2d 168, 113 S. Ct. 2578 (1993); see also Jesse W. Markham, The Nature and Significance of Price

] In a 
duopoly, a market with only two competitors, supracompetitive pricing at monopolistic levels is a danger. See Edward Hastings 
Chamberlin, The Theory of Monopolistic Competition: A Re-orientation of the Theory of Value 46-55 (8th ed. 1962). "
139,24," Contrary to the appellees' claims, nothing in Baker Hughes suggests otherwise. In that case, the sophisticated nature of the 
purchasers of the industry's product and the ""volatile and shifting"" nature of each firm's market share rendered the HHI figures 
an unreliable measure of concentration. See 908 F.2d at 986-87. No such circumstances exist in this case. "
140,25," The district court noted that ""the parties have not stressed private equities"" but the court nonetheless considered them. It 
concluded that while ""the corporate interests of Heinz and Milnot and especially the interests of Dearborn Capital Partners LP, 
which presumably acquired Milnot through a leveraged buyout with the purpose and intent of selling its interest at a profit"" were 
important to the private parties, they should not affect the outcome of the proceeding.  H.J. Heinz, 116 F. Supp. 2d at 200 n.9. 
We agree. ""While it is proper to consider private equities in deciding whether to enjoin a particular transaction, we must afford 
such concerns little weight, lest we undermine section 13(b)'s purpose of protecting the 'public-at-large, rather than the individual 
private competitors.'"" University Health, 938 F.2d at 1225 (citation omitted); cf.  Weyerhaeuser, 665 F.2d at 1083 (""Private 
equities do not outweigh effective enforcement of the antitrust laws. When the Commission demonstrates a likelihood of ultimate 
success, a countershowing of private equities alone would not suffice to justify denial of a preliminary injunction barring the 
merger.""). "
141,26," ""The most difficult mergers to assess may be those that combine both negative and positive effects: creating market power 
that increases the risk of oligopolistic pricing while at the same time creating efficiencies that reduce production or marketing 
costs."" Sullivan & Grimes, supra, § 9.1, at 511. "
154,1," In light of the extensive argument and documentary exhibits surrounding the present motion, a motion for reconsideration is

155,2," In the following sections, the court makes findings of uncontroverted fact, based upon the pleadings submitted by the parties,

are irrelevant, unsupported consistent with the requirements of D.Kan. Rule 56.1, or corroborated only by inadmissible evidence. "

197,6," Of Course, these routes are ""core"" routes not in the sense that they form the center-piece of either American's business, or 
form even a significant portion of all flights from DFW. Rather, they are denominated here as such simply because they form the 
vast majority of the government's case against American. The remaining routes are frequently treated, in the pleadings, 
arguments, and in the proof, as afterthoughts tacked onto the underlying claims involving LCC competition on the core routes. "
198,7," HN8[
] The theory of predatory pricing inherently assumes not only a reduction in price, but a corresponding increase in 
capacity. ""Predatory pricing requires the predator to increase its output during the predatory period. Simply announcing a price 
cut without increasing output does no good, for the predator will run out of inventory and be unable to steal sales."" 3 P. Areeda & 
H. Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law, PP 729 and 308 (Rev. ed. 1996). The government's eleventh hour suggestion that the present 
action is a horse of a completely different color -- that it is concerned with predatory capacity, not predatory pricing -- is 
unpersuasive. It is still the same horse. "
199,8," The Matsushita Court also noted ""there is a consensus among commentators that predatory pricing schemes are rarely tried, 
and even more rarely successful."" 475 U.S. at 589."
199,9," Another authority has also urged caution: An argument that a practice is ""predatory"" is likely to point to exactly those things that ordinarily signify efficient conduct. A 
plaintiff charging predation will classify a reduction in price, an expansion in output, the building of a new plant, and so on as 
proof of the defendant's villainy. Unless we have some powerful tools to separate predation from its cousin, hard competition, 
any legal inquiry is apt to lead to more harm than good. Given the general agreement that almost all price reductions, sales 
increases, additions to capacity, and so on are beneficial, we need a very good ground indeed to treat a particular instance of 
such conduct as unlawful. F. Easterbrook, Predatory Strategies and Counterstrategies, 48 U. Chi. L. Rev. 263, 266-67 (1981) (footnotes omitted). "
200,10," The objective nature of this inquiry was also stressed by the Seventh Circuit in A.A. Poultry Farms, Inc. v. Rose Acre Farms, 
Inc., 881 F.2d 1396, 1401-02 (7th Cir. 1989), where the court observed that subjective measures may be inherently misleading: Firms ""intend"" to do all the business they can, to crush their rivals if they can. ""'Intent to harm' without more offers too vague a 
standard in a world where executives may think no further than 'Let's get more business,'"" Barry Wright [v. ITT Grinnell Corp.], 
724 F.2d [227,] 232 [(1st Cir.1983).] Rivalry is harsh, and consumers gain the most when firms slash costs to the bone and pare 
price down to cost, all in pursuit of more business. Few firms cut price unaware of what they are doing; price reductions are 
carried out in pursuit of sales, at others' expense. Entrepreneurs who work hardest to cut their prices will do the most damage to 
their rivals, and they will see good in it. You cannot be a sensible business executive without understanding the link among 
prices, your firm's success, and other firms' distress. . . . . "
201,," Almost all evidence bearing on ""intent"" tends to show both greed-driven desire to succeed and glee at a rival's predicament. 
Take, for example, the statement David Rust made to Phillip Gressell: ""We are going to run you out of the egg business. Your 
days are numbered."" Undoubtedly Rust wanted to leave Gressell scratching in the dust, but drive to succeed lies at the core of a 
rivalrous economy. Firms need not like their competitors; they need not cheer them on to success; a desire to extinguish one's 
rivals is entirely consistent with, often is the motive behind, competition. Or take Lois Rust's statement that Rose Acre's prices 
were unrelated to its costs. Plaintiffs treat this as a smoking gun. Far from it, such a statement reveals Rose Acre to be a price 
taker. In perfect competition, firms must sell at the going price, no matter what their own costs are. High costs do not translate to 
the ability to collect a high price; someone else will sell for less. Monopolists set price by reference to their costs (to be precise, 
they set quantity where marginal cost equals marginal revenue, a measure reflecting the shape of the market's demand curve, 
and charge the price the market will bear at that quantity); competitors set price by reference to the market. A predator, too, is 
highly sensitive to its costs of doing business; it calculates how much sacrifice it needs to make (and could bear), and uses that 
as the basis of its prices. So the statement that Rose Acre does not pay attention to its own costs when setting price reveals that 
the firm was acting as a competitor rather than a monopolist. Yet statements of this sort readily may be misunderstood by 
lawyers and jurors, whose expertise lies in fields other than economics. The Third Circuit has expressed a similar view: Advo officials themselves have used aggressive-sounding language. Its CEO, Robert Kamerschen, once directed his managers 
""to seize the OPPORTUNITY inherent in the stumbling PROBLEMS of the newspaper industry,"" and quoted McDonald's founder 
Ray Kroc for the advice that ""when [you] see the competition drowning, … stick a water hose down their throats."" App. at 459. The antitrust statutes do not condemn, without more, such colorful, vigorous hyperbole; there is nothing to gain by using the law 
to mandate ""commercially correct"" speech within corporate memoranda and business plans. Isolated and unrelated snippets of 
such language ""provide no help in deciding whether a defendant has crossed the elusive line separating aggressive competition 
from unfair competition."" Morgan v. Ponder, 892 F.2d 1355, 1359 (8th Cir.1989). Advo, Inc. v. Philadelphia Newspapers, Inc., 51 F.3d 1191, 1199 (3rd Cir. 1995): "
202,11," Marginal cost is the increment to total cost arising from an additional unit of output. Because ""marginal cost is extremely 
difficult to measure"" in the real world, Areeda and Turner advocate analysis based on average variable cost, that is, ""all costs 
properly classified as variable, including use depreciation, divided by relevant output."" Areeda & Hovenkamp, P 740a, at 378, 
379."
202,12," The Tenth Circuit's decision in Instructional Sys. Dev. Corp. v. Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 817 F.2d 639, 648 (10th Cir. 1987), 
applying a total cost standard to a predation claim, was decided prior to Brooke Group. "
203,13," The court does not view such long-term ownership cost as truly variable with the addition of capacity on the core routes. At 
least under the circumstances of this case, where American shifted existing aircraft to the new routes, such costs are more 
appropriately viewed as fixed. However, since American's marginal revenues exceeded its costs even when measured by 
""VAUDNC-AC,"" this conclusion is not essential to the court's holding."
203,14," Professor Hovenkamp in a letter to the Department of Justice has warned that alternative measures of costs (beyond average 
variable costs) ""are problematic in that (1) they represent severe departures from existing case law; and (2) will be hazardous to 
administer in court."" (Def. Exh. 123, at 4). The opinion letter was inadvertently delivered by Justice Department to American, and 
the court has previously determined that under the circumstances of the case the plaintiff has waived any claim of privilege 
associated with the letter. Mem. Order, September 28, 2000 (Dkt. No. 347). "
204,15," The government also rationalizes such an incremental cost measure on the grounds that the standard approach (using 
average variable costs) is inappropriate where average variable costs are significantly below marginal costs. The court rejects 
such an approach for three reasons. First, there is no evidence to support it. Second, existing authority is to the contrary. See 
Continental Airlines, Inc. v. American Airlines, Inc., 824 F. Supp. 689, 698 (S.D. Tex. 1993) (noting that in the airline industry 
""variable costs change very little, AVC is close to MC (marginal cost) at all levels of output""). Finally, such an approach is also 
contrary to the previously stated position of the United States, which has observed: ""In general, airlines' average variable costs 
exceed their marginal costs."" (Def. Exh. 144). "
206,16," The government also urges the court to adopt FAUDNC as a measure of average total cost, and argues that such a standard 
is permissible in light of Instructional Systems Dev. Corp. v. Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 817 F.2d 639 (10th Cir. 1987). As the court 
notes above, HN21[
] average total cost is not an appropriate measure of costs to determine predation under Brooke Group. 
The court rejects the government's suggestion that Instructional Systems compels a different result. First, as the Tenth Circuit 
stated in a case decided after Instructional Systems, it had not expressed any definitive ruling on the issue of appropriate costs. 
Multistate Legal Studies, 63 F.3d at 1549 n.5. Moreover, Instructional Systems was decided prior to Brooke Group, and the 
Supreme Court's observation there that ""appropriate costs"" are to be determined in light of incremental, not total costs. As Judge 
Lungstrum has observed, citing Pacific Eng'g & Prod. Co. of Nevada v. Kerr-McGee Corp., 551 F.2d 790 (10th Cir. 1977), the 
Tenth Circuit has indicated that HN22[
] ""marginal or average variable cost, as opposed to total cost, is the best indicator 
regarding predatory pricing."" Bushnell Corp., 175 F.R.D. at 588."
206,17," ""An average cost figure is said to be fully allocated when it includes all costs that are encountered in a single firm or plant, 
whether or not they are incurred in the production of the product or service under analysis."" 3 Areeda & Hovenkamp, P 741f at 
pp. 409-10. (emphasis in original.) "
213,18," There is evidence that, after commencing the additional flights on the Phoenix route, American's Decision FAUDNC 
experienced a one month decline. But it is uncontroverted that the FAUDNC did not become negative, and, as noted above, 
there is no evidence that American's revenues were below an appropriate measure of cost."
213,19," Professor Berry did not find any appropriate ""base period"" of ""normal"" competition for MCI II, and so could not generate an 
analysis under his first test. "
214,20, Professor Berry also did not calculate an analysis of net sacrifice on DFW-LGB using his first test.
214,21," American contends that an underlying contradiction exists between the government's claims on the one hand, that there are 
high strategic barriers to entry at DFW, and the government's contention (or assumption) on the other that, but for American's 
alleged reputation for predation, LCCs would have initiated service at DFW. The court agrees there exists a potential conflict in 
these arguments, which could present a matter for substantial consideration should the present action have proceeded to trial. 
However, the court decides the present motion on the grounds that uncontroverted facts fail to demonstrate both the existence 
of substantial structural entry barriers at DFW and/or existence of a well-founded reputation for illegal predation."
214,22," In Multistate Legal Studies, 63 F.3d at 1549 n.6, the court noted the existence of the question of ""whether a defendant with a 
monopoly in one market would have any plausible reason to use its monopoly profits in that market to subsidize predation in a 
second market."" The court also noted the Supreme Court's language in Matsushita that ""a conspiracy to increase profits in one 
market does not tend to show a conspiracy to sustain losses in another."" 475 U.S. at 596. The court concluded, in light of the 
specific evidence in that case, that it could not conclude as a matter of law there might not be some larger cross-market scheme. 
At the same time, the court concluded independently that there was independent evidence to support a material question of 
recoupment in the main (supplemental workshop) market. 63 F.3d at 1555-56. "
215,23," Professor Stiglitz has admitted that an airline can acquire a reputation for aggressive behavior without engaging in predatory 
pricing, and that such a reputation for aggressiveness (by non-predatory, lawful competition) is ""by definition"" not anti-
competitive. (Stiglitz 10-3-00 dep. at 284-85)."
215,24," There is some speculative evidence from Professor Berry about assumed additional profits American could gain if its 
reputation caused a 10% reduction in the probability of an low fare carrier hub at DFW for five years, or a two-year delay by an 
LCC in building a hub at DFW. But there is no foundation for this hypothetical. Berry testified that these calculations are 
""examples"" and ""exercises,"" and he was not stating as an opinion that a low fare carrier would actually have built a DFW hub but "
216,," for American's reputation. He has not attempted to quantify the likelihood of such a carrier creating a hub at DFW. He assumed 
a 10% reduction in the probability of a low fare carrier at DFW because ""Ten percent is a nice round number."" (Berry 12-20-00 
dep. at 800)."
216,25," In fact, the government comes close to abandoning this theory in the small portion of its Response devoted to the issue, 
agreeing that it has ""no 'backup' theory for a finding of monopolization solely as a result of reputation,"" suggesting instead that 
""reputation is only one mechanism"" which caused American's acts in core markets to be felt elsewhere. (Resp. at 65). It is not 
clear how this saves the government's claims, since it fails to provide specific evidence how additional mechanisms combined 
with reputation resulted in monopolization or attempted monopolization of specific routes. As noted above, the government's 
claims of reputational liability suffer from a complete lack of supporting evidence. "
217,26," The government claims that Vanguard was deterred from entering DFW-ICT and DFW-PHX, SunJet was deterred from 
entering DFW-LGB, Western Pacific from entering was deterred from entering DFW-COS, Great Plains was deterred from 
entering DFW-ICT, and Ryan Airlines was deterred from entering DFW-ICT."
217,27," Specifically, the government suggests that JetBlue was deterred from entering DFW-JFK, National was deterred from entering 
DFW-LAS, Frontier was deterred from entering DFW-DEN, and Vanguard was deterred from entering DFW-CVG."
217,28," The government cannot rescue these unfounded claims based upon a general allegation of a ""scheme."" See Continental Ore 
Co. v. Union Carbide and Carbon Corp., 370 U.S. 690, 82 S. Ct. 1404, 8 L. Ed. 2d 777 (1962) (reviewing court should avoid "
218,," ""tightly compartmentalizing the various factual components"" of plaintiff's claim ""and wiping the slate clean after scrutiny of 
each""). Here, whether considered individually or collectively, the government's claims of predation fail to meet established legal 
standards and minimal standards of proof. HN36[
] A violation of Section 2 is not established merely by showing that there ""is a fraction of validity to each of the basic claims and the sum of the fractions is one or more."" City of Groton v. Connecticut Light 
& Power, 662 F.2d 921, 928-29 (2d Cir. 1981). Therefore, where claims of anticompetitive conduct are individually shown ""in 
numerous critical respects [to be] utterly lacking"" the plaintiff's claims then ""collectively cannot have any synergistic effect"" 
rescuing their validity. Northeastern Tel. Co. v. American Tel. & Tel. Co., 651 F.2d 76, 94-95 n. 28 (2d Cir. 1981). "

] (a) Any person injured by any violation, or who would suffer injury from any threatened violation, of this chapter 
may maintain an action in any court of equity jurisdiction to prevent, restrain, or enjoin such violation or threatened violation. 
If in such action a violation or threatened violation of the chapter shall be established, the court shall enjoin and restrain, or 
otherwise prohibit, such violation or threatened violation and, in addition thereto, the court shall assess in favor of the 
plaintiff and against the defendant the costs of suit, including reasonable attorney's fees. In such action it shall not be 
necessary that actual damages to the plaintiff be alleged or proved, but where alleged or proved, the plaintiff in said action, 
in addition to such injunctive relief and cost of suit, including reasonable attorney's fees, shall be entitled to recover from the 
defendant the damages sustained by him. "
232,2," Evidence in support of plaintiffs' application for temporary restraining order was heard on December 7 and 8, 1999. A hearing 
on plaintiffs' application for preliminary injunctive relief was held on December 27, 1999. The final hearing was conducted on 
March 19, 20, 23, and 26 -- 28, 2001."
232,3," Plaintiffs are Alabama corporations. They conduct business principally within that State, but also service some retail gasoline 
stations in southern Tennessee. Defendant is an Arkansas corporation headquartered in that State."
232,4," This action originally was filed in the Circuit Court for Madison County, Alabama, but was removed to this court by defendant on 
December 1, 1999, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1332, 1441, 1446. Plaintiffs moved to remand (doc. no. 5), asserting this court 
lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the amount in controversy did not exceed $ 75,000. The court received evidence on 
that issue on December 7, 1999, and determined that the value to plaintiffs of the rights sought to be enforced by injunction was 
greater than the jurisdictional threshold. See, e.g., Hunt v. Washington State Apple Advertising Commission, 432 U.S. 333, 347, 
97 S. Ct. 2434, 2443, 53 L. Ed. 2d 383 (1977) HN3[
] (""In actions seeking declaratory or injunctive relief, … the amount in 
controversy is measured by the value of the object of the litigation.""); Ericsson GE Mobile Communications v. Motorola 
Communications & Electronics, Inc., 120 F.3d 216, 218 (11th Cir. 1997) (same); Occidental Chemical Corp. v. Bullard, 995 F.2d 
1046, 1047 (11th Cir. 1993) (same)."
232,5," See Plaintiffs' Exhibit 16, at 18-19, 25, 27. "
233,6," In other words, a total of eight vehicles can simultaneously pump gasoline from the four pumps."
233,7," Murphy operates a similar retail gasoline facility on the parking lot of the Wal-Mart SuperCenter in Madison, Alabama, but that 
station was not implicated by the evidence presented in this action."
233,8," The 6.8 cent per gallon ""projected"" cost of doing business is based upon two sources: the testimony of Murphy's Vice President 
of Retail Marketing, Hank Heithaus, during the TRO hearing; and, the stipulation of the parties. This court observes, however, 
that while the pro forma projection may have been this amount, Murphy's Pricing Manager from August 1999 to January 1, 2001, 
James David Ridings, testified at final hearing that Murphy's ""general guideline"" for the cost of doing business at stations within 
Alabama was 7 cents a gallon. That rule of thumb established by Ridings's superior, Hank Heithaus. More importantly; however, 
Murphy's actual costs of doing business at the south Huntsville station exceeded even that amount, as will be noted hereafter."
233,9," These sales volumes are even more remarkable when one considers that the Murphy station cannot be directly reached from 
the principal north-south traffic artery in Huntsville, South Memorial Parkway, but must be accessed either through the Wal-Mart 
parking lot (which does front on the Parkway) or via a side street intersecting the Parkway."
233,10," Pursuant to the agreement between Wal-Mart and Murphy, the following applies:"
233,26," .1 Gift Card Discount a. Lessor [Wal-Mart] and Lessee [Murphy] agree to offer a discount to Station customers who use a gift card issued by 
Lessor (the ""Gift Card"") at certain Stations selected by Lessor. In the event Lessor's customer purchases a Gift Card in 
Lessor's store for a designated amount, the Gift Card may be used to purchase gasoline (but no other products or services 
unless hereafter specifically agreed to in writing by Lessor and Lessee) at Lessee's station for a discounted price. Lessee 
agrees to contribute a 3 cent discount per gallon of gasoline sold under the Gift Card. Lessor agrees to contribute any 
discount over the 3 cent discount, the amount thereof to be determined solely by Lessor from time to time. Lessor's goal is 
to support the level of discount necessary for the Cross Promotion to be mutually satisfactory. …"
233,26," .2 Gift Card Sales … c. In the event the Gift Card discount offered under this program would cause Lessee to offer a price to the public that is 
below the level permitted by applicable law, the price shall be lowered only to the level permitted by applicable law. Lessee "
234,," will provide written monthly reports to Lessor which track Lessee's costs at each particular station operating under this 
program. Plaintiffs' Exhibit 36, PP 26.1(a), 26.2(c) (emphasis supplied)"
234,11," July 31, 1999 through May 23, 2000."
234,12," The ""pool margin"" is the margin for all grades of gasoline (i.e., regular unleaded, plus, and premium)."
234,13," It should be noted that these numbers are based on the ""pool margin,"" rather than the margin for regular, unleaded gasoline, 
data for which was not provided."
234,14," Significantly, Murphy's expert noted in his revised report dated September 15, 2000 that ""November is known to be a month of 
lower sales volume."" Plaintiffs' Exhibit 39, P 37."
234,15," Campbell acquired all stock of Stephens Oil Co., Inc., the wholesale and retail distributor for Chevron petroleum products in 
the Huntsville, Madison County, Alabama market, on November 8, 1999. On the date of that acquisition, the combined 
companies (Campbell & Sons Oil Co., Inc., Campbell Brothers Oil Co., Inc., and Stephens Oil Co., Inc.) became the second 
largest branded gasoline distributor in Alabama. Since then, however, the combined companies have slipped to ""probably the 
top five or six"" distributors, according to Alan Campbell, Secretary of the closely-held, family-owned corporations."
234,16, Campbell sells Conoco-branded petroleum products at retail through 15 company owned stations in North Alabama.
234,17," Campbell serves 84 Texaco stations: 55 of those are company owned and sell Texaco-branded products at retail; the 
remainder are independent dealers to whom Campbell sells at wholesale."
234,18, Campbell owns and operates 9 such unbranded stations. 
235,19," The Alabama Supreme Court so held, because the act of reading each section ""literally and in isolation might well lead to a 
conclusion that they are unreasonably overbroad or void for vagueness …."" State ex rel. Galanos v. Mapco Petroleum, Inc., 519 
So. 2d 1275, 1286 (Ala. 1987). "

237,21," The President of Thrasher Oil testified that the ""laid-in cost"" of motor fuel is calculated by adding federal, state, and local 
taxes, freight costs, and inspection fees to the ""rack price"": i.e., the amount paid for each gallon purchased at the Duncan 
Terminal near Birmingham, Alabama (see Plaintiffs' Exhibit 1: a copy of the Oil Price Information Service (""OPIS"") listing for the 
period November 12-29, 1999). As thus defined, the trade idiom ""laid-in cost"" includes all variables delineated in the statutory 
term, ""cost to retailer,"" except the retailer's ""cost of doing business"" discussed in the following textual paragraph and footnote. 
See Ala.Code § 8-22-4(16), reading as follows: (16) COST TO RETAILER. As applied to retail sales, the invoice or replacement cost of the motor fuel within five days prior 
to the date of sale, in the quantity last purchased, whichever is less, less all trade discounts except customary discounts for 
cash, to which shall be added all applicable state, federal and local taxes, inspection fees, freight cost, if paid by the 
retailer, plus the cost of doing business. [Emphasis supplied.]"
237,22," HN15[
] See Ala.Code § 8-22-4(17), defining the phrase, ""cost of doing business or overhead expenses,"" as including all costs incurred in the conduct of business, including but not limited to: labor (including salaries of executives and 
officials), rent (which rent must be no less than fair market value based on current use), interest on borrowed capital, 
depreciation, selling cost, maintenance of equipment, transportation or freight cost, losses due to breakage or damage; 
credit card fees, or other charges; credit losses, all types of licenses, taxes, insurance, and advertising."
237,23, See supra note 8 and related text.
237,24, See supra note 21.
237,25," See Plaintiffs' Exhibit 16, at 79-80, 96-99. "
238,26," See Plaintiffs' Exhibit 45. Calculations also were made for July 1999, but the station was open for business only one day 
during that month, July 31. The figures for July will not be considered in the following discussion."
238,27, Id. at 33-34.
238,28," The planning model for Murphy's south Huntsville station included the following categories specified in the Act: labor, rent, 
maintenance of equipment, losses due to damage or breakage, credit card fees, all types of licenses, taxes, insurance, and 
advertising. It did not specifically include interest on borrowed capital, depreciation, selling costs, or credit losses. See Plaintiffs' 
Exhibit 16, at 100-05."
238,29, See Plaintiffs' Exhibit 47.
238,30," See Plaintiffs' Exhibit 49. The cost for November could not be calculated using this method, as there was a negative margin."
238,31, See Plaintiffs' Exhibit 51.
238,32, See supra note 25 and related text.
238,33," 7.44 [cents] (Aug. 1999) + 10.90 [cents] (Sept. 1999) + 8.57 [cents] (Oct. 1999) + 8.76 [cents] (Nov. 1999) = 35.67 [cents] / 4 = 
8.9175 [cents] average."
238,34," See infra section VI, addressing plaintiffs' motions to hold Murphy in contempt. "
239,35," I.e., $ 1.1529 a gallon ""laid-in cost"" + 0.069 [cent] a gallon cost of doing business = 1.2219 a gallon cost - 1.049 per gallon 
pump price = 0.1729 [cent] less than Murphy's costs."
239,36, 17.29 [cents] + 3 [cents] Gift Card discount = 20.29 [cents] less than Murphy's costs.
239,37," The parties have stipulated that Murphy's margins for regular, unleaded gasoline were negative numbers: that is, -10.05 cents 
a gallon on November 18th, -8.6 cents on November 19th through November 21st, -10.6 cents on November 22nd, -3.6 cents on 
November 23rd, and -1.05 cents on November 24, 1999. The parties have further stipulated that Murphy's negative margins for 
the Gift Card discount sales were even greater. Additionally, these stipulated amounts do not take into account the cost of doing 
business."
239,38," Plaintiffs' Exhibit 39, P 35."
239,39, Id. P 38.
239,40," In Star Service & Petroleum Co., Inc. v. State of Alabama ex rel. Galanos, 518 So. 2d 126, 128 (Ala. Civ. App. 1986), the court 
found the testimony of the defendant's competitors that they were injured by its below cost pricing of gasoline sufficient to 
support a finding that the defendant had injured competition. "
240,41," It should be further noted that Murphy's expert witness, Dr. Siegfried, testified at final hearing that he disagrees with the 
AMFMA's definition of competition set forth at Ala.Code § 8-22-4(13), and with the Alabama Supreme Court's holding, 
interpreting that section, in McGuire Oil Co. v. Mapco, Inc., 612 So. 2d 417, 422 (Ala. 1992), that ""injury to a competitor suffices 
to establish a violation of the AMFMA."" Notwithstanding, as the Eleventh Circuit noted in Alan's of Atlanta v. Minolta Corp., 903 
F.2d 1414, 1418 n.6 (11th Cir. 1990), ""for the time being we are satisfied merely to make it clear that when confronted with 
contemporary economic argument on the one hand and judicial precedent on the other, we feel, unlike those of a more activist 
bent, that economic argument is not ultimately controlling; judicial precedent is."" (Citation omitted.) This court is similarly 
persuaded."
240,42, See Defendant's Exhibit 86. These figures have been rounded to the nearest gallon.
240,43," When discussing volumes sold by the parties, the court is not basing its decision on the simplistic fact that Murphy's station 
attracted more customers during the period in question than did plaintiffs' retail outlets. Rather, the court is utilizing those 
numbers as a rough measurement of the injurious effect of Murphy's illegal pricing practices on two competitors. As such, the 
finding is not contrary to the holding in Star Service & Petroleum Co., Inc. v. State, 518 So. 2d 126 (Ala.Civ.App. 1986): We agree with Star that it is part of the normal competitive process for competitors to be ""injured"" when they lose 
customers to a marketer who offers the public a lower price. Such ""injury"" is not what the AMFMA addresses. Rather, it is 
injury to competition (which necessarily includes injury to competitors) due to certain unlawful sales tactics, such as selling 
motor fuel below cost, as in this case. Id. at 130 (emphasis supplied). Moreover, the finding is not contrary to the recent decision of the Alabama Supreme Court in 
Young Oil Co. v. Racetrac Petroleum, Inc., 757 So. 2d 380, 386 (Ala. 1999), holding HN18[
] that ""the AMFMA does not 
penalize petroleum marketers … for an increase in market share (and concomitantly, a loss of market share by its competitors) 
resulting from a more efficient operation,"" because Murphy has failed to demonstrate that its contested retail price of 1.04 a 
gallon (much less the 1.01 a gallon price offered to Wal-Mart Gift Card holders) included any consideration of Murphy's ""cost of 
doing business or overhead expenses"" at the Wal-Mart SuperCenter station on South Memorial Parkway. "
241,44, See Plaintiffs' Exhibit 104.
241,45, See Plaintiffs' Exhibit 103.
241,46, See Defendant's Exhibit 1.
241,47," Charles Williams, President of Williams Petroleum Company, testified that the dealer at the Gasoline Alley station changed 
brands last year, and is now a ""Gas Plus"" station. Williams Petroleum Company no longer has a station in Gasoline Alley. "
242,48," Additionally, Murphy's surveys for November 22nd through November 29th conflict with the records of Williams Petroleum of 
the prices charged at the Mojo's station on Memorial Parkway."
242,49, Plaintiffs' Exhibit 36 (emphasis supplied).
242,50," ""Gasoline Alley"" comparators are identified on each sheet of Defendant's Exhibit 1 by the initials ""GA."" The Williams Service 
and the Spur stations listed on the survey were also located in Gasoline Alley. See supra note 47."
242,51," See Richard A. Posner, Economic Analysis of Law 282 (3d ed. 1986) (noting the tendency of courts when defining market 
areas ""to include in the market those sellers who actually sell to the same group of customers and exclude those who do not""). 
Cf. United States v. Engelhard Corp., 126 F.3d 1302, 1305 (11th Cir. 1997) (""The boundaries of the product market are 
determined by the reasonable interchangeability of use or the cross-elasticity of demand between the product and substitutes for 
it."")."
242,52," Murphy was offered the opportunity to demonstrate that the stations in Gasoline Alley were within its relevant market area, but 
failed to do so. The testimony adduced at trial has persuaded this court that the relevant market area for the Murphy station on 
Memorial Parkway is a one to one-and-one-half mile radius, which does not include the stations in Gasoline Alley. While 
unbranded stations, such as Murphy, typically offer lower gasoline prices than branded stations, such as those operated by the 
plaintiffs, there are several unbranded competitors within the relevant market area. As such, there is no justification for Murphy 
to consider the stations in Gasoline Alley when making pricing decisions. Notwithstanding, as noted supra, none of the Gasoline "
243,," Alley comparators listed on Murphy's price surveys actually sold regular, unleaded gasoline for as little as $ 1.04 a gallon during 
the relevant period. Compare, e.g., Defendant's Exhibit 1 with Defendant's Exhibit 137."
243,53," In Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir. 1981)(en banc), HN24[
] the Eleventh Circuit adopted as 
binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down prior to the close of business on September 30, 1981. "
244,54," Another purpose of state ""fair competition"" acts is ""to afford smaller, less powerful competitors an effective remedy for below 
cost selling and other unfair acts."" Samuel L. Perkins, Charles F. Phillips & Geoffrey B. Schwartz, A Place for Fair Competition 
Acts in Motor Fuel Marketing, 26 N. Ky. L. Rev. 211, 260 (1999)."
244,55," At first reading, it might appear that a civil penalty can be assessed only in actions brought by the Attorney General of 
Alabama or a local district attorney. The reader must note well, however, that HN27[
] subsection (a) of § 8-22-16 refers to ""attorney fees,"" in addition to the civil penalty. By contrast, subsection (b) provides for apportionment of the payment of the civil 
penalty between the office of the district attorney and the treasury of the county where the action was brought, or between the 
treasury of the county where the action was brought and the State Treasury. Clearly, attorney fees cannot be assessed for 
actions brought by a district attorney or the Attorney General, and the apportionment in subsection (b) is intended to compensate 
the office of the district attorney or the Attorney General for time and effort expended by its attorneys in bringing the action. 
Accordingly, a person who violates the Act is subject to a civil penalty, regardless of whether the action is brought by private 
plaintiffs or by one of the State's attorneys. "
245,56, Doc. no. 47.
245,57," According to Murphy's records, Gift Card sales accounted for 30.2% of total gallons sold."
245,58," At some point on February 25, 2000, Murphy raised its street price to $ 1.38 a gallon, and its Gift Card price to $ 1.35 a gallon."
245,59," Gift Card sales accounted for 33.2% of total gallons sold on February 22, 2000; 31.7% of total gallons sold on February 23, 
2000; and 27.1% of total gallons sold on February 24, 2000."
245,60," David Ridings testified that in early 2000, a new computerized system was developed by Murphy's Information Systems 
Department, at his request, which permitted station managers to enter the price survey information by telephone, using the 
telephone keypad. Mr. Ridings testified that the ""lawsuit"" stores, including the Murphy station on Memorial Parkway, were 
required to fax the handwritten surveys in addition to entering the information by telephone."
245,61," David Ridings would normally have made the decision, but he was not in the office. Carl James was the Assistant Pricing 
Manager at the time, and made the decision, with Hank Heithaus' concurrence, in Mr. Ridings' absence. "
246,62, Doc. no. 63.
246,63," Doc. no. 70 (incorrectly entitled ""second amended motion"")."
246,64, The price decrease to $ 1.44 a gallon was communicated to the station manager by fax at 12:41 p.m.
246,65, Murphy had discontinued the gift card discount by this date. 
247,66, Doc. no. 79.
247,67," The ""pool margin,"" or margin for all grades, was .0896. The margin for regular, unleaded gasoline was .0587. "
248,68," Mr. Ridings testified that the copy of the ""second survey,"" admitted as part of defendant's exhibit 6, came from the station, and 
that he had neither a record nor a recollection of receiving it."
248,69, The individual margins for the various grades of gasoline are not reflected on the computerized survey.
248,70, Doc. no. 88.
248,71," Spur's price was $ 1.37 a gallon, Pure's price was $ 1.37 a gallon, and Williams Service's price was $ 1.36 a gallon."

249,73, See supra note 47.
249,74, See supra note 35. 
250,1," See, e.g., Ala.Code § 8-22-2(4) (""Subsidized pricing is inherently predatory and is reducing competition in the petroleum 
industry, and if it continues unabated, will ultimately threaten the consuming public."") (1975) (1993 Replacement Vol.). 
Essentially, Murphy Oil USA, Inc. only is being required to comply with the laws of the State of Alabama."
250,2," For the origin of this amount, see the testimony of Murphy's Pricing Manager, James David Ridings, referenced in note 8 of the 
accompanying memorandum opinion."
250,3, See note 21 of the accompanying memorandum opinion and related text.
250,4," Defendant must clearly understand and, therefore, is forewarned by this court that the figure of 7.0 cents per gallon per grade is 
neither talismanic, nor considered by this court as an absolute, but is instead a variable subject to proof of a different amount. 
Thus, when, as has been unequivocally proven here, defendant's actual costs of doing business at any station during a relevant 
period exceed 7.0 cents per gallon per grade (see, e.g., pages 11-- 13 of the accompanying memorandum opinion), then 
defendant must apply its actual cost of doing business when computing its ""cost to [the] retailer"" of selling each grade of 
gasoline to the public at retail. Further, the ""cost to [the] retailer"" of each grade of gasoline sold must be computed separately 
and severally, and not ""pooled."" See, e.g., note 12 of the accompanying memorandum opinion."
250,5," A competitor is ""on the same level of distribution"" when it is selling any grade of branded or unbranded gasoline to the public at 
retail. A competitor is ""within the same market area"" whenever the retail gasoline station is located within a one and one-half (1 
1/2) mile radius of defendant's south Huntsville station. See, e.g., page 21 and note 52 of the accompanying memorandum 
opinion. "

applied in Sherman Act cases. This pro se rule is a valid and useful tool of antitrust policy and enforcement."" Broadcast Music,

indirect purchasers possess standing to recover damages in antitrust actions. Although the Court found that indirect purchasers 
may not recover damages in antitrust actions, it stated that the indirect purchaser bar may not be applicable ""where the direct 
purchaser is owned or controlled by its customer."" Id. at 736 n.16. In McCarthy v. Recordex Service, Inc., 80 F.3d 842 (3d Cir. 
1996), the Third Circuit addressed the owner or control exception. The McCarthy court determined that plaintiffs in the case, 
attorneys representing plaintiffs filing malpractice actions, did not qualify for the Illinois Brick exception to the indirect purchaser 
prohibition.  Id. at 853. In this case, the parties disagree as to whether or not, under McCarthy, plaintiffs fall under the Illinois 
Brick exception. "
259,5," The court finds that the representative plaintiffs, as set out in the Settlement Agreement, are entitled to an incentive award of 
up to $ 1,000. The representative plaintiffs, however, must establish by affidavits their entitlement to such an award based on the 
time and money they invested in the litigation. See Fry, 198 F.R.D. at 473. "
265,1," Defendants submitted materials outside of the pleadings by attaching Wertjes' W-2 form to their reply brief. Because OMB has 
not had an opportunity to conduct discovery on the factual issues which are raised by the W-2 form (e.g., why no amounts are 
listed), the Court will not convert defendants' motion to dismiss to one for summary judgment. "

the IGRA. See Pueblo of Santa Ana v. Kelly, 932 F. Supp. 1284, 1296 (D.N.M. 1996) (finding evidence in legislative history that 
Congress did not intend that the Secretary's approval override deficiencies in the compact under State law), aff'd 104 F.3d 1546 
(10th Cir. 1997). "
295,3," ""HN6[
] Management contract"" is defined as ""any contract, subcontract, or collateral agreement between an Indian tribe and a 
contractor or between a contractor and a subcontractor is such contract or agreement provides for the management of all or part 
of a gaming operation."" 25 C.F.R. § 502.15."
295,4," HN7[
] Collateral agreements are defined as ""any contract, whether or not in writing, that are related, either directly or 
indirectly, to a management contract, or to any rights, duties or obligations created between a tribe (or any of its members, 
entities, or organizations) and a management contractor or subcontractor (or any person or entity related to a management 
contractor or subcontractor)."" 25 C.F.R. § 502.15. "
296,5," The factors used in Altheimer to determine whether a particular contract is relative to Indian land are: (1) whether the contract 
relates to the management of a facility located on Indian lands; (2) whether the contract grants non-Indians the exclusive right to 
operate the facility. (3) whether the contract forbids the tribe from encumbering the property; and (4) whether the validity of the 
depends upon the legal status of tribes as a separate sovereign.  Altheimer, 983 F.2d at 807. No one factor is a sina qua non of 
finding that Section 81 applies.  Id. at 811, (quoting Barona Group of Capitan Grande Band of Mission Indians v. American 
Management & Amusement, Inc., 840 F.2d 1394 (9th Cir. 1987), cert. dismissed, 487 U.S. 1247, 109 S. Ct. 7, 101 L. Ed. 2d 
958 (1988)). Since most management contracts contain all of these elements in varying degree, Section 81 required Secretarial 
approval for the majority of these agreements. See 25 U.S.C. § 81; United States ex rel. Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux 
Community v. Pan American Management Co., 616 F. Supp. 1200, 1209 (D. Minn. 1985). "
300,6," Pertinent parts of the text of this unusual agreement are set out below: [Park Place] will be the exclusive developer of any such Class II and/or Class III casino for the State of New York (excluding 
[the Akwesasne and one other potential project]) under a development agreement to be entered into hereafter in good faith 
by the parties; [Park Place] will also be the Manager of any such . . . casino . . . along terms substantially similar to those set forth in the 
purported Gaming Facility management Agreement between the Tribe and Mohawk Management, LLC, . . . except that as 
an essential term of such any [sic] agreement [Park Place] will have an initial term of seven (7) years. [Park Place] and the 
Tribe will have a profit distribution of 70% to the Tribe and 30% to [Park Place]. All of the foregoing is subject to the approval of NICG. [Park Place] will provide the financing necessary to construct such casino facilities. [Park Place] agrees that construction of 
a gaming facility will commence within thirty-six (36) months of this agreement unless otherwise extended by written 
consent of the Tribe. The Tribe's portion of the casino profits shall be utilized to pay back [Park Place's] advances. Such 
payback shall be completed within the seven (7) year term or less without penalty or any agreed upon extension of such 
term. . . . . In consideration of the foregoing, [Park Place] will pay to the Tribe the sum of $ 3 million for use by the Tribe in it's 
discretion. Such payment will be made as soon as reasonably possible after full execution of this agreement and shall be 
paid back to [Park Place] only in the event that the Tribe does not or is unable to enter in the development, management 
and licensing agreements set forth above; and "
301,," Both parties understand that there exists between the Tribe and Mohawk Management, LLC a purported Gaming Facility 
Management Agreement signed on July 31, 1996. Both the Tribe and [Park Place] believe such agreement is 
unenforceable and of no force and effect for, among other reasons, (1) it is subject to the approval of the NIGC, which 
approval has not been granted; and (2) there are serious questions as to whether the signatories on behalf of the Tribe to 
the agreement had the legal right and/or capacity to enter into such agreement and bind the Tribe. [Park Place] also 
understands the Tribe's legal position with respect to the unenforceable agreement and agrees that it will indemnify the 
Tribe against any litigation resulting from the Tribe entering into this Agreement with [Park Place] in substitution with the 
Tribe's prior understanding with the developers of a proposed casino at the Monticello Race Track."
301,7," Plaintiffs also allege that Park Place, ""for a brief period of time,"" collaborated with Donald Trump and his organization to defeat 
the casino project. They also allege that Park Place principals Arthur Goldberg and Clive Cummis, along with Trump, sought the 
assistance of New Jersey Senator Robert Torricelli in this endeavor. They also refer to a ""legal challenge"" to the Governor's 
authority to amend the compact with the Mohawks that Plaintiffs' claim was ""secretly orchestrated"" by Trump and two 
""disinterested"" New York legislators, and to ""smear campaigns"" instituted against the Governor, Catskill's principals, and the 
Mohawks by a non-profit group called the ""New York Institute for Law & Society."" "
302,8," The Court learned of the Tribal Court ruling after all briefing on defendant's motion was complete. By letter dated March 23, 
2001, the Court invited the parties to submit comments on what effect, if any, the Tribal Court action has on this lawsuit. Both 
sides responded on March 28 by letter brief. Plaintiffs argued that collateral estoppel bars relitigation of whether enforceable 
contracts existed between the Tribe and plaintiffs, and whether Park Place interfered with the contracts and the project. 
Defendant argued that the Tribal Court decision had no effect because (1) the Tribal Court is not a recognized, legitimate 
governmental entity of the Tribe, (2) the decision was a default judgment and is thus not entitled to collateral estoppel effect, and 
(3) the Tribal Court decision purports to decide issues based upon Mohawk tribal law and does not purport to decide any of the 
legal issues raised in the motion to dismiss. "
304,9," Specifically, defendant contends that: (1) the Land Purchase Agreement required Governor Pataki's concurrence in the BIA 
approval under 25 U.S.C. § 2719; (2) the Management Agreement required NIGC approval under § 2710 and § 2711; (3) the 
Mortgage Agreement (in addition to not being executed) required approval under Section 81; (4) the Shared Facilities 
Agreement required approval under Section 81, and was contingent on § 2719 approval; (5) the Development and Construction 
Agreement required approval under Section 81, and was contingent on approval under § 2719. Furthermore, because the Tribe 
had no compact in place with the State that allowed for electronic games, defendant argues that the project is economically 
untenable, and that damages, should be limited to lost revenue from the ""table games"" allowed by the current compact."
304,10," However, as discussed below, a ""best efforts"" provision will come into play where a contract is valid; i.e., it does not fall within 
Section 2711 or any other ""automatic invalidation"" statutory provision, and there are no express conditions precedent to the 
contract's validity. See supra, section II.C.3. "
306,11," Section 465 authorizes the Secretary of the Interior, in his discretion, to acquire ""lands, water rights or surface rights"" through 
""purchase, relinquishment, gift, exchange, or assignment. . . within or without existing reservations, including trust or otherwise 
restricted allotments."" Under regulations passed pursuant to this section, the land attains trust status only after the Secretary has 
published a notice of intent to take the land into trust pursuant to § 151.6(c)(2), the time period for appeal has run, and all title 
objections have been cleared, and the BIA approves or issues the appropriate instrument of conveyance."
306,12," The parties did not address whether the trust transfer was an express condition precedent to liability under the contract, or 
whether the contract is void under its terms for any other reason. "
307,13," The Court first raised the issue of the availability of lost profits or damages with the parties at a pre-trial conference on March 
9, 2001. After Judge Teresi issued his opinion, the Court, in an April 25, 2001 letter, invited both parties to comment on the 
ruling's impact on this lawsuit. Both parties responded by letter on May 2, 2001. "
308,14," In support of this contention, they point to the following (among other items): (1) all necessary contracts between the parties 
had been executed (2) the SEQRA process (undefined by the plaintiffs) was fully completed, including all environmental 
approvals; (3) the BIA had approved the Land to Trust transfer, ""subject to the concurrence of the Governor and NIGC approval 
of the management agreement."" the latter of which was ""progressing favorably;"" (4) the parties had received the NIGC's final 
comments and NIGC approval ""at this stage was a mere formality for documentation compliance;"" (5) ""the Governor was ready 
to concur;"" (6) the local community was behind the project; and (7) the construction contract was awarded and construction was 
set to begin immediately subsequent to the expected approvals. (Id.) They also claim that ""the evidence will show that the BIA 
would not have approved the land to Trust transfer had the Governor not indicated his support and willingness to amend the 
existing compact to add VLTs"" (a term which plaintiffs do not define, but which the court believes is a reference to video gaming 
terminals of some kind). (Id. at 3.) "
311,15," The Court is aware that the Attorney General of the State of New York has stated publicly that existing facilities, including 
Akwesasne, are not affected by Judge Teresi's ruling. See Michael Gormley, ""State Says Existing Casinos not Threatened in 
Indian Gambling Decision,"" Associated Press, April 20, 2001. "
312,1," By Order of October 4, 2000 (Doc. No. 52), the claims against third-party defendants John F. A. Earley, P.C. and Harding, 
Earley, Follmer & Frailey were terminated. "
323,2," As a result of the discharge, Smith instituted a wrongful discharge suit against Rotonics in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania 
which ultimately was resolved pursuant to a settlement agreement. "
326,3," HN15[
] Federal Circuit law applies to all antitrust claims premised on the bringing of a patent infringement suit. See Nobelpharma AB v. Implant Innovations, Inc., 141 F.3d 1059, 1068 (Fed. Cir. 1998). It follows that antitrust claims premised on 
notice given to infringers is also governed by Federal Circuit law. Nevertheless, the law of the regional circuit continues to apply 
""to issues involving other elements of antitrust law such as relevant market, market power, damages, etc., as those issues are 
not unique to patent law, which is subject to the exclusive jurisdiction [of the Federal Circuit]."" Id. (citations omitted). "
327,4," The first exception to the Noerr-Pennington doctrine, obtaining the patent through knowing and willful fraud, is not here at 
issue."
327,5," Paragraph ten of the court's scheduling order requires the opposing party to file a separate statement of material facts 
responding to each of the numbered paragraphs in the moving party's statement of material facts. Although Rotonics filed its 
statement, PennPac has failed to respond. As such, the court may accept Rotonics' statement of material facts as undisputed. "
328,6," Based upon an assignor estoppel theory, Rotonics also moves the court to enter judgment in its favor on the affirmative 
defense of invalidity and unenforceability of the '947 Patent asserted by PennPac in response to Rotonics' counterclaim for 
patent infringement. This argument will be addressed when the court considers PennPac's motion for summary judgment on all 
counts of Rotonics' counterclaims (Doc. No. 48) also pending before me."
328,7," PennPac submits that Smith signed the Stock Purchase Agreement only in his official capacity as President of Plastech. This 
statement, however, is contradicted by the plain language of the agreement which clearly shows that Smith signed as President 
of Plastech Holdings, Inc., as President of Plastech International, Inc., and as an individual seller. Indeed, while Joseph L. Ponce 
signed individually and as attorney in fact for each of the other sellers, Smith's name was crossed from that list and separately 
listed and signed in Smith's personal capacity. As such, it is clear that Smith was also an individual party to the Stock Purchase 
Agreement. "
329,8," Because the parties concede that Pennsylvania law against unfair competition is co-extensive with federal antitrust law, 
judgment likewise will be entered in favor of Rotonics on Count II of plaintiff's complaint."
329,9," While Cheminor concerned New Jersey state law claims and the construction thereof, the parties have not pointed to and the 
court has not found any Pennsylvania cases which suggest that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court would hold otherwise. "
331,10," While neither party addresses the issue in terms of federal preemption, Rotonics does assert that Zenith Elecs. places the 
burden of proving bad faith on PennPac."
331,11," Rotonics submits that the court's opinion in Patient Transfer Sys., Inc. v. Patient Handling Solutions, Inc., 1999 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 19296, No. CIV. A. 99-1568, 1999 WL 1212189, *2 (E.D. Pa. Dec. 17, 1999), misapprehended the full import of Zenith, 
which requires a plaintiff to show bad faith in all cases premised upon a patentholder's publication of patent rights. Defendant, 
however, is incorrect. In Patient Transfer, the use of the phrase ""initial burden"" to describe a movant's burden to point out the 
existence of a privilege is consistent with the court's language today, that the movant's initial burden is to show the absence of 
evidence to support plaintiff's case. Nevertheless, to the extent that the language employed in Patient Transfer is unclear, the 
court today has clarified its intent. "
333,12," HN39[
] Section 768 has been recognized by Pennsylvania courts. See Brokerage Concepts, 140 F.3d at 530 (citing cases). That section provides: § 768. Competition as Proper or Improper Interference. (1) One who intentionally causes a third person not to enter into a prospective contractual relation with another who is his 
competitor or not to continue an existing contract terminable at will does not interfere improperly with the other's relation if (a) the relation concerns a matter involved in the competition between the actor and the other and (b) the actor does not employ wrongful means and (c) his action does not create or continue an unlawful restraint of trade and (d) his purpose is at least in part to advance his interest in competing with the other. (2) The fact that one is a competitor of another for the business of a third person does not prevent his causing a breach of 
an existing contract with the other from being an improper interference if the contract is not terminable at will. "
337,1," Sanderson has moved for leave to file a Second Amended Complaint that differs from the First Amended Complaint only by 
deleting references to certain alleged ""co-conspirators"" who have settled their differences with Sanderson. The motion for leave 
to file the Second Amended Complaint is hereby granted, but the ruling on the defendants' motions to dismiss shall also apply to 
the Second Amended Complaint, which defendants need not answer. "
339,2," Sanderson relies on American Society of Mechanical Engineers, Inc. v. Hydrolevel Corp., 456 U.S. 556, 72 L. Ed. 2d 330, 102 
S. Ct. 1935 (1982), which affirmed an antitrust verdict against a professional association for adopting standards that excluded 
plaintiff's product. On this issue, the critical fact in Hydrolevel was that the defendant-association's standards, while advisory, 
had ""a powerful influence: federal regulations have incorporated many of them by reference, as have the laws of most States, 
the ordinances of major cities, and the laws of all the Provinces of Canada."" 456 U.S. at 559. In this case, Sanderson has not 
alleged or argued that the WQA's standards have been incorporated into applicable law so as to impose legal barriers for his 
products. See also Consolidated Metal Products, Inc. v. American Petroleum Institute, 846 F.2d 284, 296 n.43 (5th Cir. 1988) 
(distinguishing Hydrolevel on precisely this basis). "
342,3," The court also agrees with defendants that Sanderson has failed to allege antitrust injury in this case. See generally Banks v. 
NCAA, 977 F.2d at 1087-89 & n.9. The court has not relied on defendants' argument that the complaint should be dismissed for 
failure to allege defendants' market share. "
348,1," The Fourth Circuit did not rule out the possibility of adopting the self-concealing standard in certain cases. However, Meadow 
Gold Dairies involved allegations of price-fixing and the Court found that price-fixing is not inevitably deceptive or concealing.  
Supermarket of Marlinton, Inc. v. Meadow Gold Dairies, Inc., 71 F.3d at 123. The Court stated, however, that ""If an antitrust 
violation were demonstrated to be in its very nature deceptive, i.e., concealment was an element of the offense rather than 
merely a method of hiding it, then application of the self-concealing standard might well be appropriate.  Id. at 123 & n.1."
348,2," Defendants seem to argue that fraudulent concealment consists of affirmative acts independent of the underlying conspiracy. 
However, the weight of authority has adopted the view that a plaintiff must prove that the defendants affirmatively acted to 
conceal their antitrust violations, but the plaintiff's proof may include acts of concealment involved in the antitrust violation itself. 
As the Fourth Circuit explained, this standard permits courts to ""avoid the difficult, if not impossible, task of deciding which acts 
are in furtherance of conspiracies and which acts are separate and apart from conspiracies."" Supermarket of Marlinton, Inc. v. 
Meadow Gold Dairies, Inc., 71 F.3d 119, 125 (4th Cir. 1995). "
349,3," Fraudulent concealment may also be establish by showing that a special relationship existed between the parties that imposed 
a duty to disclose the cause of action, and the failure of defendants to honor that duty.  Harkness v. Fitzgerald, 1997 ME 207, 
P6, 701 A.2d at 372. Plaintiffs do not argue that a special relationship exist between the parties."
349,4," There are no Maine cases discussing the requirements for pleading due diligence. However, the First Circuit's pleading 
standard would appear to represent the majority view. See e.g., Lanza v. Merrill Lynch & Company Inc., 154 F.3d 56, 60 (2nd 
Cir. 1998); Scherer v. Balkema, 840 F.2d 437, 441 n.8 (7th Cir. 1988). "
359,*," Circuit Judge of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation."
359,1, We will refer to Spectators' and Mitchell collectively as Spectators'. 
364,2," ""HN15[
] Restraints imposed by agreement between competitors have traditionally been denominated as horizontal restraints, 
and those imposed by agreement between firms at different levels of distribution as vertical restraints."" Business Elecs. Corp. v. 
Sharp Elecs. Corp., 485 U.S. 717, 730, 99 L. Ed. 2d 808, 108 S. Ct. 1515 (1988). "
365,3," Mitchell's testimony about these conversations with sponsors appears to be vulnerable to hearsay objection. However, 
Anheuser-Busch does not object to it and Spectators' argues that it is admissible as co-conspirator hearsay. Because the district 
court did not rule on the admissibility of the evidence, we will not do so in the first instance, but will consider it part of the record 
for the sake of argument."
365,4," Although Spectators' devotes most of its brief to arguing that it showed a horizontal conspiracy that is per se illegal, it also 
makes vertical boycott, rule of reason arguments that preserve the rule of reason issue for our review. Spectators' argues at 
length that its case is comparable to Fineman v. Armstrong World Industries, Inc., 980 F.2d 171 (3d Cir. 1992), and MCM 
Partners, Inc. v. Andrews-Bartlett & Associates, Inc., 62 F.3d 967 (7th Cir. 1995), vertical boycott cases involving coerced 
customers. HN20[
] Vertical boycotts are subject to the rule of reason. See NYNEX, 525 U.S. at 138. Moreover, Spectators' argues that the district court should have considered the anticompetitive acts of the entire conspiracy, rather than those of 
Anheuser-Busch alone; at the same time, Spectators' also argues that proof of anticompetitive effects is irrelevant to a per se 
case. Thus, by arguing the merits of an issue that is irrelevant to per se analysis, Spectators' is evidently challenging the district 
court's rule of reason holding. "
380,1," Time and Warner are both alleged to be subsidiaries of the corporation now known as AOL Time Warner. (Am. Compl. PP 30, 
31, 38.G.5, 38.I.) "
382,2," HN3[
] Secondary-line price discrimination occurs where, as is alleged here, the seller's discrimination affects competition 
between the seller's customers. See George Haug, 148 F.3d at 141 n.2. "
383,3," The Court notes that Scherer did not buy publications; Scherer was not a wholesaler. It is difficult to see, then, how Scherer 
suffered from any price discrimination. The Court does not now consider it necessary to address Scherer's standing to allege this 
or any other cause of action because the Court is dismissing all of plaintiffs' claims for other reasons. However, if plaintiffs file a 
second amended complaint, pursuant to Section VI, infra, they must make certain, consistent with their obligations under Fed. R. 
Civ. P. 11, that each plaintiff has standing to assert each cause of action against each defendant. Plaintiffs must also make 
certain, consistent with Rule 11, that each of them has a good faith basis in fact and law to assert each cause of action against 
each defendant. Plaintiffs, six separate legal entities, may not simply assume that the ability of any one of them to assert a given 
cause of action against any one of the defendants gives all of them the ability to assert that cause of action against all 
defendants. "
385,4," HN9[
] Claims under the Donnelly Act and the Valentine Act are analyzed in the same manner as claims under the Sherman 
Act. Cancall PCS, LLC v. Omnipoint Corp., 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2830, No. 99 Civ. 3395 (AGS), 2000 WL 272309, at *12 
(S.D.N.Y. Mar. 10, 2000) (hereinafter ""Cancall I"") (Donnelly Act); Reddy v. Good Samaritan Hosp. and Health Ctr., No. C-3-90-
197, 2000 WL 33281117, at *30 n. 29 (S.D. Ohio Sept. 19, 2000) (Valentine Act). "
387,5," One district court in this Circuit has observed that courts have not uniformly held that the fourth element, anticompetitive effect 
in the tied market, is required. See Audell Petroleum Corp. v. Suburban Paraco Corp., 903 F. Supp. 364, 368 n. 3, 370 (E.D.N.Y. 
1995). Given the Second Circuit's decision in Hack, this Court deems that it must apply all five elements. "
393,6," Although this is a motion under Rule 12(b)(6), the Court may consider the Purchase Agreement because several of plaintiffs 
claims, including this one, are founded upon that contract. See Cortec Indus., Inc. v. Sum Holding, L.P., 949 F.2d 42, 48 (2d Cir. 
1991). "
403,1," General Wine's motion to dismiss was initially directed at NWS's original complaint. After General Wine filed its motion, NWS 
filed a first amended complaint in an attempt to cure the pleading deficiencies alleged by General Wine in its motion. The Court 
has permitted General Wine and NWS to file supplemental briefs regarding the sufficiency of the first amended complaint and 
will consider the instant motion as being addressed to the first amended complaint. "
406,2," The Supreme Court subsequently held that vertical maximum price fixing agreements do not constitute a per se violation but 
rather are governed by the rule of reason analysis. See State Oil Co. v. Khan, 522 U.S. 3, 118 S. Ct. 275, 139 L. Ed. 2d 199 
(1997). "
407,3," The term ""suppliers"", as it relates to ADA's such as NWS and General Wine, is really a misnomer because NWS and General 
Wine are actually the suppliers of warehousing and distribution services."
407,4," The cases cited by NWS do not support a finding of antitrust injury in this case. In Farley Transportation Co. v. Santa Fe. 
Trail Transportation Co., 786 F.2d 1342 (9th Cir. 1985), the Court likened the defendant's violation of tariff regulations to 
predatory pricing, a situation not present in this case. National Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers, Inc. v. Ayerst "
408,," Laboratories, 850 F.2d 904 (2d Cir. 1988) is not relevant to this case because it involved the publication of false and misleading 
information, which is also a situation not present in this case. "
415,1," The Joint Motion to Dismiss was filed by defendants Hoffman-La Roche, Inc., Roche Vitamins, Inc., BASF Corporation, Rhone-
Poulenc Animal Nutrition Inc., Rhone-Poulenc, Inc., Takeda Chemical Industries, Ltd., Takeda Vitamin & Food USA, Inc., Daiichi 
Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.; Daiichi Pharmaceutical Corporation, Daiichi Fine Chemicals, Inc., Eisai USA, Inc., Eisai Inc., Akzo 
Nobel Chemicals B.V., Akzo Nobel Inc., Lonza Inc., Bioproducts Inc., Degussa-Huls Corporation, EM Industries, Inc., Mitsui & 
Co., Ltd., Nepera, Inc., Reilly Industries, Inc., Sumitomo Chemical America, Inc., Tanabe USA, Inc., and UCB Chemicals 
Corporation. This Motion has also been adopted by Chinook Group, Ltd., Cope Investments Ltd., DuCoa, L.P., DCV, Inc., UCB 
S.A., Eisai Co., Ltd., Hoechst Marion Roussel, S.A., Rhone-Poulenc S.A., Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd., Degussa AG, Merck 
KgaA, E. Merck, F. Hoffman-La Roche, Ltd., BASF Aktiengesellschaft, Lonza AG, Alsuisse Group Ltd., and Lonza Inc. "
417,2," Plaintiffs make a similar argument with respect to the legislative history of the FTAIA, which makes the Sherman Act applicable 
""if"" the alleged restraints on export trade have a direct and substantial effect on U.S. commerce. Plaintiffs argue that if Congress 
had intended to make the FTAIA applicable only to particular injuries with these domestic effects, it would have said that 
jurisdiction exists ""to the extent that"" or ""insofar as"" the requisite U.S. effects are found, rather than ""if"" the requisite effects are 
found. "
419,3," The Amended Complaint does state that P&G suffered injury in the United States; however, there is no similar allegation made 
with respect to the other United States corporation, P&G Manufacturing. Moreover, the allegations with respect to even the 
former plaintiff are too general and conclusory and require additional detail before this Court can resolve the standing question. "
420,4," Although the case was originally transferred to this Court only for pretrial proceedings, the parties to that case have 
subsequently entered into a stipulation that dictates that the case will be ""treated for all purposes as if it has been transferred to 
the D.C. Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a) and shall not be remanded for trial. . . ."" 1/26/01 Stip. and Ord. Re: Personal 
Jurisdiction and Refiling of Actions P 2. However, according to defendants, the Stipulation does not involve all defendants so the 
domestic P&G plaintiffs' claims may not be so easily consolidated with this action."
420,5," Since the Court is dismissing the claims brought by the foreign plaintiffs, it may be more practical for the domestic plaintiffs to 
consolidate their claims into the Ohio action currently pending before the Court; should the parties agree to consolidation, they 
should notify the Court as soon as possible. "
421,6," Plaintiffs may be correct that the future of global antitrust policy could be in favor of a customary international law proscribing 
the type of conduct alleged here; certainly, there is some evidence that such an international consensus may be needed in 
today's world of global economies. However, the law has not yet evolved to this point. A single United States district court cannot 
enact such an international agreement where none exists. Therefore, although plaintiffs may have predicted the future of the 
law, they have not stated a cause of action under present international law. "
422,7," If either domestic plaintiff finds that it cannot allege the necessary facts to establish subject matter jurisdiction and standing in 
accordance with the Court's legal rulings in this Opinion, that plaintiff should file the appropriate dismissal documents with the 
Court. "
432,1," The Joint Motion to Dismiss is brought by defendants F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd., Hoffman-La Roche Inc., Roche Vitamins Inc., 
BASF Corp., Aventis S.A. (f/k/a Rhone-Poulenc S.A.), Aventis Animal Nutrition S.A., Rhone-Poulenc Animal Nutrition Inc.,

433,2," The Empagran action involved largely foreign plaintiffs who were seeking to recover for vitamins purchased for delivery abroad. 
The claims of these foreign plaintiffs have been dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction."
433,3," While there is evidence before the Court that the purchases of the foreign subsidiaries and affiliates were in fact coordinated by 
personnel at the United States parent companies, these allegations are largely absent from the relevant complaints. Therefore, 
the Court will require plaintiffs to amend their complaints to make these subsidiary-parent relationships explicit and thus to 
highlight this Court's jurisdiction over the foreign subsidiaries' claims. Kellogg's proposed third amended complaint accomplishes 
this purpose, see Prop. Third Amend. Compl P 42(a), so Kellogg need not file another amended complaint; however, the other 
plaintiffs should follow Kellogg's example and flesh out their parent-subsidiary financial relationships. "
434,4," The record contains numerous exhibits and affidavits detailing the coordination between the parent companies and their 
subsidiaries. As discussed above, the Court is requiring plaintiffs to amend their pleadings to specifically incorporate this 
evidence of the financial control of the parent companies over their subsidiaries."
434,5," Nevertheless, plaintiffs' argument that defendants have waived any real party in interest objection by not raising it earlier is 
without merit. Although plaintiffs are correct that HN5[
] such objections must be raised with ""reasonable promptness"" and can 
be waived, courts have generally only found waivers where the objections were raised during pretrial proceedings or on the eve 
of trial. See, e.g., Whelan v. Abell, 293 U.S. App. D.C. 267, 953 F.2d 663, 675 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (defense waived when raised 
after trial was already underway); see also United Healthcare Corp. v. American Trade Insurance Co., 88 F.3d 563, 569 (8th Cir. 
1996) (defense waived when raised at pre-trial conference, held one week before trial). The objection here was raised in a 
motion to dismiss while the parties are still in the discovery phase of this litigation. Therefore, the Court does not find that 
defendants have waived their right to argue that plaintiffs are not the real parties in interest. "
435,6," All of the affiliates have not yet filed formal ratifications, but all have indicated their willingness to do so should the defendants 
and the Court request this action. See, e.g., Cargill Mem. at 41 n.28. Such formal ratification may in fact be unnecessary given 
the representations by these affiliates that they agree to be bound by this action. See Honey v. George Hyman Construction Co., 
63 F.R.D. 443, 448 (D.D.C. 1974) (formal ratification deemed ""a meaningless act"" in light of evidence that the real parties in 
interest had consented to the commencement of the action by plaintiff). However, in the interests of caution and in order to 
ensure that defendants are fully protected against the risk of multiple recoveries, the Court will require the affiliates to file formal 
notices of ratification such as that filed by the Kellogg affiliates. "
441,1, Supra's Second Amended Complaint is fifty (50) pages long.
441,2," ILECs are typically entrenched local telephone companies like BellSouth, Ameritech, etc."
441,3," It should be noted that this Court, in a January 20, 2000 Order, dismissed all of Supra's claim relating to their contract with 
BellSouth for the resale of services because they were not properly litigated before the FPSC as per the parties forum selection 
clause. [DE-37]. Therefore, the only claims permitted to go forward by the January 20, 2000 Order were claims that arose under 
the parties' Interconnection Agreement. Upon a close reading of the Second Amended Complaint, it appears that this Resale 
Contract was the only operative contract under which any business between the two parties ever commenced and that Supra is 
attempting to shoehorn their claims of breach of the Resale Contract into claims under the Interconnection Contract. If that is 
indeed the case, then this Court does not have jurisdiction over this suit. However, accepting all of Supra's allegations as true, 
which the Court must at this time, this Court will assume for the moment that Supra's claims arise out of the Interconnection 
Agreement. "
442,4," Supra alleges that the deletion was an intentional attempt by BellSouth to take advantage of a ruling in Iowa Utilities Bd. v. 
F.C.C., 120 F.3d 753 (8th Cir. 1997) prior to its overruling by the Supreme Court in AT&T Corp. v. Iowa Utilities Bd., 525 U.S. 
366, 142 L. Ed. 2d 834, 119 S. Ct. 721 (1999). "
443,5," Supra also argues that the ""facts of Goldwasser are nothing like the facts of this case,"" because the plaintiffs in Goldwasser 
were consumers rather than competitors. (Pl.'s Sur-Reply at 1.) However, the court in Goldwasser found that the consumers had 
standing to raise the rights of competitors. Goldwasser, 222 F.3d at 398. Thus, Supra's attempt to differentiate this case with 
Goldwasser on the differences between the plaintiffs is disingenuous at best."
443,6," Because this Court finds that Supra fails to state an antitrust claim, it is unnecessary for the Court to make a determination as 
to BellSouth's implied antitrust immunity claim. "
444,7," Supra cites several Florida cases, like Mobile America Corp., Inc. v. Southern Bell Telephone and Telegraph, Co., 282 So. 2d 
181 (1st DCA 1973), for the proposition that claimants may bring damages actions to the courts prior to a determination by the 
FPSC because the FPSC cannot award damages. This Court first notes that all the cases cited by Supra long predate the TCA. 
Further, it is possible that following a determination by the FPSC, Supra could attempt to bring an action in federal court for 
damages under 47 U.S.C. § 252(e)(6). However, because Supra's Second Amended Complaint does not allege that the FPSC 
has yet made a determination on the alleged breaches of the Interconnection Agreement, that analysis would be premature."
444,8, Supra's claims do directly implicate the regulatory scheme of the TCA.

476,1," During pendency of a subsequent appeal, Union Oil Company of California entered into a judicially approved settlement with 
Aguilar, was dismissed from the action with prejudice, was consequently dismissed from the appeal, and, hence, does not make 
an appearance on review. Even though it did not participate much on appeal and did not participate at all on review, it did indeed 
participate generally in the events recounted herein, both within court and without. The collective phrase ""petroleum companies,"" 
which we use throughout for the sake of convenience, should be understood accordingly. "
478,2," The Court of Appeal implied that, in support of its motion for summary judgment, Tosco alone of the petroleum companies did 
not present, or at least did not rely on, any declaration by any of its officers or managers or similar employees. But, in fact, like 
all of the others, it did indeed do so. "
479,3," Ultramar requests us to take judicial notice of Attorney General of the State of California, Report on Gasoline Pricing in 
California (May 2000). Aguilar opposes. We nevertheless grant the request. As a ""reviewing court"" ( Evid. Code, § 459, subd. 
(a)), we may take judicial notice of the report of a state executive officer as reflecting an ""[o]fficial act[]"" (id., § 452, subd. (c); see 
Assem. Com. on Judiciary com., reprinted at 29B pt. 1 West's Ann. Evid. Code (1995 ed.) foll. § 452, p. 450). We hereby do so 
as to the Attorney General's report. Aguilar claims that Ultramar's request amounts to an attempt improperly to augment the 
record. We would not allow any such attempt to succeed. We consider the Attorney General's report only for background. To the 
extent that Aguilar moves us to strike, as an improper augmentation of the record, a volume of appendices including the Attorney 
General's report that Tosco has submitted with its brief in this court, we deny her application, considering the materials therein 
only for background. "

480,4," HN10[
] On summary judgment, the moving party's burden is more properly labeled as one of persuasion rather than proof. 
That is because, in order to carry such burden, he must persuade the court that there is no material fact for a reasonable trier of 
fact to find, and not prove any such fact to the satisfaction of the court itself as though it were sitting as the trier of fact. (See 
Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., supra, 477 U.S. at p. 249 [106 S. Ct. at pp. 2510-2511].) "
482,5," All that is stated in the text is true under Matsushita for any antitrust claim asserting an unlawful conspiracy under section 1 of 
the Sherman Act by any plaintiff. But where the ""factual context"" of a particular claim shows it to be ""implausible"" as ""simply 
mak[ing] no economic sense,"" then the particular plaintiff ""must come forward with more persuasive evidence to support [the] 
claim than would otherwise be necessary."" ( Matsushita Elec. Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio, supra, 475 U.S. at p. 587 [106 S. 
Ct. at p. 1356].)"
482,6," Aguilar requests us to take judicial notice of various legislative documents relating to the 1992 amendment. The petroleum 
companies do not oppose. We grant the request. We must, of course, judicially notice the law of this state. ( Estate of Joseph 
(1998) 17 Cal. 4th 203, 210, fn. 1 [70 Cal. Rptr. 2d 619, 949 P.2d 472].) We may judicially notice documents relating thereto.

488,," We need not, and do not, consider whether summary judgment law in this state now conforms to its federal counterpart as

conspiracy under section 1 of the Cartwright Act. See, ante, at page 847, footnote 5. That is because, as even the petroleum 
companies themselves admit, Aguilar's claim, whatever its merits, is far from implausible."

the evidence to determine whether a reasonable juror could find that the plaintiff has satisfied his burden of persuasion is a 
traditional judicial function"")."
488,27," Accord, 2 Areeda and Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law, supra, paragraph 322, page 70 (stating that, ""when the evidence is in

489,," ""cannot say whether"" a ""conspiratorial or non-conspiratorial explanation is more probable,"" ""summary judgment . . . would have 
to be given against the party bearing the burden of persuasion"" by a preponderance of the evidence)."
489,28," Compare Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Technical Services, Inc. (1992) 504 U.S. 451, 468 [112 S. Ct. 2072, 2083, 119 L. Ed. 
2d 265] (stating that ""Matsushita demands only that the . . . inferences"" of the party opposing a motion for summary judgment 
""be reasonable in order to reach"" a trier of fact). "
490,29," In successfully moving the superior court for a new trial following its order granting the petroleum companies summary 
judgment, Aguilar, in effect, sought and obtained reconsideration of the order granting summary judgment. It is not hard to infer 
why she did not move for reconsideration eo nomine. First, to make a motion for reconsideration, she would have had to have 
""new or different facts, circumstances, or law"" in support. ( Code Civ. Proc., § 1008, subd. (a).) She apparently had none. 
Second, by the date on which she made her motion for a new trial, the superior court had caused entry of judgment. After entry 
of judgment, the superior court did not have jurisdiction to entertain or decide a motion for reconsideration. (See, e.g., In re 
Marriage of Condon (1998) 62 Cal. App. 4th 533, 541, fn. 8 [73 Cal. Rptr. 2d 33]; Betz v. Pankow (1993) 16 Cal. App. 4th 931, 
937-938 [20 Cal. Rptr. 2d 841].) Hence, she could not have made a motion for reconsideration in the first place. "
491,30," Like the Court of Appeal, Aguilar implies that, in support of its motion for summary judgment, Tosco alone of the petroleum 
companies did not present, or at least did not rely on, any declaration by any of its officers or managers or similar employees. 
That is not the case. See, ante, at page 842, footnote 2. "
493,31," Exchange agreements have also be recognized as ""pro-environmental"" and safety enhancing, as by the Court of Appeal, to 
the extent that they obviate or reduce the ecological and other risks attendant on the storage and transportation of petroleum 
products."
493,32," See, e.g., Serfecz v. Jewel Food Stores (7th Cir. 1995) 67 F.3d 591, 600-601 (holding that, ""by itself,"" evidence of motive to 
enter into an unlawful conspiracy ""does not tend to exclude the possibility of independent, legitimate action and supplies no 
basis for inferring [such] a conspiracy""); Alvord-Polk, Inc. v. F. Schumacher & Co. (3d Cir. 1994) 37 F.3d 996, 1013 (holding to 
similar effect expressly as to evidence of opportunity and impliedly as to evidence of means)."
493,33," In the course of its opinion, the Court of Appeal characterized the superior court's determination that it made an error in law in 
its reading and application of Biljac as ""in fact"" a ""reflect[ion]"" of ""its belief that its initial decision regarding the evidentiary 
strength of"" the declarations by officers and managers and similar employees presented by the petroleum companies ""was 
incorrect."" We agree with the Court of Appeal about the superior court's belief. But we think it plain that the superior court formed 
its belief because it determined that it made an error in law in its reading and application of Biljac. "
494,34," Although it did not criticize the superior court on this score, the Court of Appeal all but expressly concluded that evidence that 
conclusively negated an unlawful conspiracy was of course sufficient, but not necessary, to carry an initial burden of production 
to make a prima facie showing of the absence of any conspiracy."
494,35," In alleging facts for her Cartwright Act cause of action, Aguilar proceeded on a theory, which was legally sound (see Corwin v. 
Los Angeles Newspaper Service Bureau, Inc., supra, 22 Cal. 3d at p. 314), that the assertedly unlawful conspiracy consisted of 
an agreement among the petroleum companies as competitors to restrict the output of CARB gasoline and to raise its price, and 
was unlawful per se without regard to any of its effects. In granting the petroleum companies summary judgment, the superior 
court did so on that theory. On appeal, Aguilar apparently attempted to introduce an alternative theory, which was also legally 
sound (see ibid.), that the assertedly unlawful conspiracy consisted of the various exchange agreements entered into by the 
various petroleum companies, and was unlawful because of its effects. The Court of Appeal rejected any such attempt as too 
late. To the extent that Aguilar makes the same attempt on review, we reject it for the same reason. (See Redwood Hatchery v. 
Meadowbrook Farms (1957) 152 Cal. App. 2d 481, 486 [313 P.2d 146] [stating that ""it is the duty of litigants to diligently prepare 
cases for trial and ordinarily they will not be allowed to gamble on the result of a trial by presenting one theory and then if 
judgment go against them get a new trial in order to try again for a favorable result under a different theory""].) "

500,2," As Germano's complaint alleges elsewhere that Microsoft distributes Internet Explorer ""without separate charge,"" the apparent

502,4," As plaintiff points out, HN12[

court, and have persuasive value only insofar as the state statutes in issue are comparable to our own. The decisions cited 
interpret Illinois Brick in reference to arguments identical to those presented here, for purposes of applying state statutes that, 
like ours, incorporate federal law. Their reasoning is persuasive, and fully applicable here. "
503,5," O'Connell's reliance on Lowell v. American Cyanamid Co., 177 F.3d 1228 (1999), is misplaced. The plaintiffs there alleged that 
the direct purchasers were participants in a vertical conspiracy.  Id. at 1229. No such allegation appears here.  Blue Shield of 
Virginia v. McCready, 457 U.S. 465, 475, 73 L. Ed. 2d 149, 102 S. Ct. 2540 (1982), is similarly unhelpful. The plaintiff there did 
not seek to recover any overcharges passed on to her by an intermediary; rather, she had paid the service provider directly, and 
sought reimbursement from her health insurer."

and under the same conditions and principles as injunctive relief against threatened conduct that will cause loss or damage 
is granted by courts of equity . . . ."
517,10," Plaintiffs allege that Blue Cross provides or administers health benefit plans for 70% of Alabama's insured residents and that 
this translates to ""millions"" of subscribers within the State. Complaint P 38. Drawing a reasonable inference from this allegation, 
one could find that Blue Cross has at least two million subscribers in the State. There is ample reason to believe that such is not 
at all an exaggeration. See http://www.bcbsal.org/bcbs about faq.html (Blue Cross states on its website that it provides coverage 
for ""more than 2.8 million people in Alabama"");(Blue Cross admitted in 1997 that its plans covered approximately 2.2 million 
Alabama residents). If so, it would mean that Blue Cross plans cover approximately half of Alabama's population. See Blue

525,19," As indicated in text above, it is not clear solely from the complaint whether Blue Cross's allegedly discriminatory policies

548,1," The Punitive Damages Act took effect 120 days after October 27, 1995, L. 1995, c. 142, § 11, but applies ""to causes of action 
filed"" on or after October 27, 1995. Model Jury Charge (Civil), 6-20, ""Damages-Punitive"" (1995). Even though probably 
technically inapplicable to this matter, since plaintiff's complaint was filed on September 26, 1994 and defendant's initial counter-
complaint was filed in October 1994, the legislation does offer some guidance on this issue since it was prospectively effective 
by the time of the Law Division trial. "
562,1," Forty-six states and six other U.S. jurisdictions (District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam and 
the Northern Mariana Islands) signed the agreement. Four states (Florida, Minnesota, Mississippi, and Texas) entered into prior

564,12," Because the congressional proposal also would have involved much higher payments by the Majors (by up to $ 170 billion), it 
was expected that cigarette prices would increase $ .60/pack. See FTC Report on Competition and the Financial Impact of the 
Proposed National Tobacco Settlement 34 (September 1997)."

565,15," Small cigarette producers (who generally sell at a discount) are referred to as ""Renegades."" The ""Renegade Clause"" 
incorporates two distinct sections of the Multistate Settlement Agreement, one part deals with Non-Participating Manufacturers 
or NPMs, the other with Subsequent Participating Manufacturers or SPMs. See MSA §§ IX(i) (SPMs), (d) (NPMs). The Attorneys 
General object to the appellation ""Renegade"" claiming that only voluntary signatories are affected by its provisions. But there are 
penalties imposed on non-signatories under the Qualifying Statutes which each State must try to implement in accordance with 
the Multistate Settlement Agreement."
565,16," There were similar provisions in the congressional proposal designed to restrict Non-Participating Manufacturers (NPMs). 
These provisions provided for escrow payments and also subjected them to the broad regulatory authority that would have been 
created under the proposal. See 1997 National Settlement Proposal, Title II, Part C."

under this Agreement only in the event that its Market Share in any calendar year exceeds the greater of (1) its 1998 Market 
Share or (2) 125 percent of its 1997 Market Share."" MSA § IX(i)(1). These payments ""are in addition to the corresponding 
payments that are due from the Original Participating Manufacturers."" MSA § IX(i)(1)."
565,18, Section IX(d) of the Multistate Settlement Agreement describes the calculation of the NPM adjustment as follows: (d) Non-Participating Manufacturer Adjustment 
566,," (1) Calculation of NPM Adjustment for Original Participating Participant Manufacturers. To protect the public health gains 
achieved by this Agreement, certain payments made pursuant to this Agreement shall be subject to an NPM Adjustment. 
Payments by the Original Participating Manufacturers to which the NPM Adjustment applies shall be adjusted as provided 
below: (A) Subject to the provisions of subsections (d)(1)(C), (d)(1)(D) and (d)(2) below, each Allocated Payment shall be adjusted 
by subtracting from such Allocated Payment the product of such Allocated Payment amount multiplied by the NPM 
Adjustment Percentage. The ""NPM Adjustment Percentage"" shall be calculated as follows: (i) If the Market Share Loss for the year immediately preceding the year in which the payment in question is due is less than 
or equal to 0 (zero), then the NPM Adjustment Percentage shall equal zero. (ii) If the Market Share Loss for the year immediately preceding the year in which the payment in question is due is greater 
than 0 (zero) and less than or equal to 16 2/3 percentage points, then the NPM Adjustment Percentage shall be equal to 
the product of (x) such Market Share Loss and (y) 3 (three). (iii) If the Market Share Loss for the year immediately preceding the year in which the payment in question is due is greater 
than 16 2/3 percentage points, then the NPM Adjustment Percentage shall be equal to the sum of (x) 50 percentage points 
and (y) the product of (1) the Variable Multiplier and (2) the result of such Market Share Loss minus 16 2/3 percentage 
points. The remainder of § IX(d) gives definitions for some of the terms and describes who will make this calculation and when it will be 
made each year, as well as how the adjusted payments will be allocated among the States and the signatories. See MSA § 
IX(d)."
566,19," The Multistate Settlement Agreement provides: (B) A Settling State's Allocated Payment shall not be subject to an NPM Adjustment: (i) if such Settling State continuously 
had a Qualifying Statute (as defined in subsection (2)(E) below) in full force and effect during the entire calendar year 
preceding the year in which the payment in question is due and diligently enforced the provisions of such statute during 
such entire calendar year; or (ii) such Settling State enacted the Model Statute (as defined in subsection (2)(E) below) for 
the first time during the calendar year immediately preceding the year in which the payment in question is due, continuously 
had the Model Statute in full force and effect during the last six months of such calendar year, and diligently enforced the 
provisions of such statute during the period in which it was in full force and effect. MSA § IX(d)(2)(B). Aside from the financial incentive, the Multistate Settlement Agreement also encourages the States to enact 
the Qualifying Statutes. See MSA § IX(d)(2)(E). "
567,20," Because this is an appeal from a dismissal under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), we address only the complaint's allegations. But we 
note that news reports have stated that although the Multistate Settlement Agreement was designed to frustrate new cigarette 
market entrants, it appears that some new discount cigarette manufacturers have been able to enter the market. Gordon 
Fairclough, Tobacco Deal Has Unintended Effect: New Discount Smokes, Wall St. J., May 1, 2001, at A1. Some new entrants 
apparently have failed to make required payments into escrow accounts as required by the state enacted Qualifying Statutes. 
Others apparently have accepted significantly lower profit margins. See id."

568,23," A ""quick-look"" analysis under the rule of reason, may be used when ""an observer with even a rudimentary understanding of 
economics could conclude that the arrangements in question would have an anticompetitive effect on customers and markets,"" 
yet the violation is also not one considered illegal per se.  Cal. Dental Ass'n, 526 U.S. at 770. We need not address whether the 
output cartel alleged here would be illegal per se or would be illegal under a ""rule of reason"" analysis. As the Supreme Court has 
held: The truth is that our categories of analysis of anticompetitive effect are less fixed than terms like 'per se,' 'quick look,' and 
'rule of reason' tend to make them appear. We have recognized, for example, that 'there is often no bright line separating 
per se from rule of reason analysis,' since 'considerable inquiry into market conditions' may be required before the 
application of any so-called 'per se' condemnation is justified. Id. at 779 (quoting NCAA, 468 U.S. at 104 n.26). HN5[

569,26," Defendants do not dedicate much of their argument to contesting the antitrust injury, perhaps because the District Court did 
not address it. The District Court found it unnecessary to decide whether plaintiffs properly pleaded an antitrust violation if it held 
defendants immune. A.D. Bedell Wholesale Co., Inc., v. Philip Morris, Inc., 104 F. Supp. 2d 501, 503 (W.D. Pa. 2000)."

570,29," HN14[
] There is a ""sham"" exception to the Noerr-Pennington doctrine which holds that using the petitioning process simply 
as an anticompetitive tool without legitimately seeking a positive outcome to the petitioning destroys immunity. See Omni, 499 
U.S. 365, 113 L. Ed. 2d 382, 111 S. Ct. 1344. There is no suggestion that the sham exception applies here. "
571,30," Despite plaintiffs' assertions, the Supreme Court has also made it clear that HN18[
] there is no ""conspiracy"" exception to 
Noerr-Pennington immunity. See Omni, 499 U.S. at 382 (""We conclude that a 'conspiracy' exception to Noerr must be 
rejected.""). Simply because the state officials might conspire with a private party to stifle competition does not mean that the 
action loses immunity. See id. at 350-51 (""We find nothing in the language of the Sherman Act or in its history which suggests 
that its purpose was to restrain a state or its officers or agents from activities directed by its legislature."")."
571,31," In doing so, we join other federal courts which have held the Multistate Settlement Agreement is entitled to Noerr-Pennington 
immunity, though we recognize these cases did not involve identical facts. See, e.g., Hise v. Philip Morris, Inc., 46 F. Supp. 2d 
1201, 1206 (N.D. Okla. 1999) (finding Noerr-Pennington immunity and not addressing Parker immunity), aff'd mem., 208 F.3d 
226 (10th Cir. 2000); Forces Action Project LLC v. California, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 163, No. C 99-0607 MJJ, 2000 WL 20977, 
at *8 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 5, 2000) (same); PTI, Inc. v. Philip Morris, Inc., 100 F. Supp. 2d 1179, 1193 (C.D.Cal. 2000) (finding Noerr-
Pennington immunity and finding Parker immunity due to direct state action because ""the M.S.A. was negotiated by the states' 
attorneys general and approved by the state courts, and thus cannot be violative of the antitrust laws""). "
572,32," See Aaron R. Gary, First Amendment Petition Clause Immunity From Tort Suits: In Search of A Consistent Doctrinal 
Framework, 33 Idaho L. Rev. 67, 113-17 (1996) (discussing the importance of the freedom to petition beyond that of expression, 
in part because the Petitioning Clause guarantees access to elected representatives and directly promotes republican 
government). "
573,33," Motive may be relevant if it demonstrates the party acted without a legitimate desire for government action, and desired to 
inflict harm only through petitioning, thus falling within the sham exception to Noerr-Pennington immunity. See Noerr, 365 U.S. at 
138 (1961) (a party will not have immunity when petitioning activity ""ostensibly directed toward influencing governmental action, 
is a mere sham to cover . . . an attempt to interfere directly with the business relationships of a competitor""). See supra note 29. 
Plaintiffs do not claim the defendants' conduct places them within the sham exception."
573,34," HN23[
] ""State action"" as defined by the Parker doctrine also differs from the government ""actions"" which results from 
petitioning discussed previously. See supra, Section III.A. The two are not coterminous. A finding of Noerr-Pennington immunity 
from injury caused by government action does not require a finding of Parker state action. See 1 Areeda & Hovenkamp, supra, 
at P 206 (interpreting our dicta in Massachusetts School of Law, 107 F.3d 1026 (3d Cir. 1997) as noting this distinction). If the 
government ""action"" taken is the result of petitioning, Noerr-Pennington immunity attaches to a broader range of government 
action than does Parker immunity. Noerr-Pennington immunity protects petitioning, so long as it is not a sham. See Subscription 
Television v. S. Cal. Theatre Owners Ass'n, 576 F.2d 230, 233-34 (9th Cir. 1978) (holding defendants immune from antitrust "
574,," liability under Noerr-Pennington even though their petitioning led to the passage of an unconstitutional initiative). Under Noerr-
Pennington immunity, the government actions which flow from valid petitioning need not qualify as Parker ""state action."" 
Petitioning ""would be considerably chilled by a rule which would require an advocate to predict whether the desired legislation 
would withstand a constitutional challenge in the courts and to expose itself to a potential treble antitrust action based on that 
prediction."" Subscription Television, 576 F.2d at 233. "
575,35," Parker, by its own terms, immunizes only states. HN28[
] But in order to give effect to Parker immunity, private parties to 
state action must also be immune. Armstrong Surgical Ctr, Inc. v. Armstrong County Mem'l Hosp., 185 F.3d 154, 159 (3d Cir. 
1999) (""If relief is sought solely for injury as to which the state would enjoy immunity under Parker, the private petitioner also 
enjoys immunity.""). Otherwise, plaintiffs could sue only the private parties and by winning antitrust judgments against them, 
could thwart state policies as if there were no state immunity. No state could enter into an agreement with private groups, even 
to further clear state policies, because the potential liability of the private groups would prevent them from joining. Artful pleading 
should not frustrate state policy. S. Motor Carriers Rate Conference, Inc., v. United States, 471 U.S. 48, 56-57, 85 L. Ed. 2d 36, 
105 S. Ct. 1721 (1985) (absent immunity for private parties, a ""plaintiff could frustrate any [State] program merely by filing suit 
against the regulated private parties""). If Parker immunity attaches, it would also reach the private participants of the Multistate 
Settlement Agreement."
575,36," The District Court found direct state action and thus did not apply Midcal. A.D. Bedell, 104 F. Supp. 2d at 507 (""After careful 
consideration of the submissions of the parties and the amici curiae, I conclude that because the conduct of entering into, 
executing and implementing the M.S.A. was undertaken by the settling states functioning in their sovereign capacities, to the 
extent Plaintiff's injuries are premised upon said conduct, liability for said conduct by the states would be subject to Parker state 
action immunity. Obviously in so holding, I opine, contrary to the argument presented by Plaintiff, that in this case, application of 
the Cal. Retail Liquor Dealers Ass'n v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc., 445 U.S. 97, 63 L. Ed. 2d 233, 100 S. Ct. 937 (1980), test is 
inappropriate.""). Similarly, one other court which has addressed the Multistate Settlement Agreement has found the presence of 
direct state action and did not undertake a Midcal analysis. See PTI, Inc. v. Philip Morris, Inc., 100 F. Supp. 2d 1179, 1196 (C.D. 
Cal. 2000) (finding that because of the direct actions by the State Attorneys General, approval by state courts, and 
implementation of Qualifying Statutes by state legislatures, the Multistate Settlement Agreement was the result of direct state 
action, rendering Midcal inapplicable). "

582,47," Although some of these statutory provisions have been amended since Midcal, the bulk were enacted before Midcal (in 1953).

(prohibiting the use of any advertisement intended to encourage minors to drink). "
583,52," See MSA § III (restricting the targeting of youth, the use of cartoons, and imposing other wide reaching regulations on 
advertising)."
583,53," We could speculate that this prong might be met if there were provisions in the Multistate Settlement Agreement which 
granted the state oversight authority on the reasonableness of price increases. It is also the case that under certain 
circumstances, immunity may attach even in the absence of supervision where the state action creates a scheme where 
anticompetitive behavior is certain to occur and where further supervision would serve no purpose. See 1 Areeda & Hovenkamp, 
supra, at P 221e4, P 226e (citing examples). However, in this case, the Multistate Settlement Agreement left significant 
decisions to private decision makers. The actual pricing decisions are exclusively under the control of the tobacco companies. 
Only their effects are governed by the structure of the Multistate Settlement Agreement."
583,54," An argument could be made that the Multistate Settlement Agreement cannot be parsed into anticompetitive restraints and 
non-anticompetitive restraints. But the better argument appears to be that restrictions on advertising and the like cannot save a 
pricing system or output control system that is not actively supervised -- even if those regulations are within the same document 
(like the Multistate Settlement Agreement) or are located within the same statutory code (as in Midcal). That other restrictions on 
wine distribution and consumption and other supervision of the wine industry are not discussed in Midcal supports this 
conclusion."
583,55," Plaintiffs assert that even if we were to find Parker immunity, there is a conspiracy exception, and that the defendants here fall 
within that exception. There is also a market participant exception to actions which might otherwise be entitled to Parker 
immunity. The District Court addressed neither argument but on appeal both parties briefed these issues. Although we do not 
find Parker immunity, we find it useful to clarify these exceptions. At one point, several courts of appeals had opined that the language in Parker which discusses the market participant exception, 
created a broad conspiracy exception. See City of Columbia v. Omni Outdoor Adver., Inc., 499 U.S. 365, 374, 113 L. Ed. 2d 382, 
111 S. Ct. 1344 (1991). The Court in Parker stated, ""We have no question of the state or its municipality becoming a participant 
in the private agreement or combination by others for restraint of trade."" 317 U.S. at 351-52 (citing Union Pac. R.R. Co. v. United 
States, 313 U.S. 450, 85 L. Ed. 1453, 61 S. Ct. 1064 (1941). The reading of a conspiracy exception also based on language in 
Parker which said, ""The state in adopting and enforcing the prorate program made no contract or agreement and entered into no "
584,," conspiracy in restraint of trade or to establish monopoly but, as sovereign, imposed the restraint as an act of government which 
the Sherman Act did not undertake to prohibit."" 317 U.S. at 352. HN33[
] But just as under Noerr-Pennington immunity, the 
state does not forfeit Parker immunity simply because it acts with a private party. In Omni, the Supreme Court made it clear that 
""there is no such conspiracy exception."" Id. The Court has clarified that the language in Parker meant ""immunity does not 
necessarily obtain where the State acts not in a regulatory capacity but as a commercial participant in a given market."" Id. As an example of what it means to be a commercial or market participant, the Court in Omni cites Union Pac. R. Co. v. United 
States, 313 U.S. 450, 85 L. Ed. 1453, 61 S. Ct. 1064 (1941), in which the City of Kansas City was held liable for certain ""rebates 
and concessions made . . . in its capacity as the owner and operator of a wholesale produce market that was integrated with 
railroad facilities."" 499 U.S. at 375. The government entity therefore was involved in the market as a buyer or seller. Other than 
Union Pacific, there has been little elaboration about the commercial participant exception to Parker immunity. The commercial or market participant exception, however, is a concept made familiar by Dormant Commerce Clause 
jurisprudence. State actions are immune from the Dormant Commerce Clause when they are regulatory actions but not where 
the state acts as a market participant just as in Sherman Act antitrust cases. See New Energy Co. v. Limbach, 486 U.S. 269, 
277, 100 L. Ed. 2d 302, 108 S. Ct. 1803 (1988) (""[The market participant exception] differentiates between a State's acting in its 
distinctive governmental capacity, and a State's acting in the more general capacity of a market participant; only the former is 
subject to the limitations of the negative Commerce Clause.""). Dormant Commerce Clause cases have found the market 
participant exception appropriate where the state action ""constituted a direct state participation in the market."" Camps 
Newfound/Owatonna, Inc. v. Town of Harrison, 520 U.S. 564, 593, 137 L. Ed. 2d 852, 117 S. Ct. 1590 (1997). This includes a 
state program to pay people who remove abandoned cars from streets and junkyards because the payment was interpreted as 
an entry into the market for abandoned cars, Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap Corp., 426 U.S. 794, 810, 49 L. Ed. 2d 220, 96 S. Ct. 
2488 (1976); a program to sell output from a state owned and operated cement plant, Reeves, Inc. v. Stake, 447 U.S. 429, 431-
32, 65 L. Ed. 2d 244, 100 S. Ct. 2271 (1980); and a program to fund construction projects entirely by a city, White v. Mass. 
Council of Constr. Employers, Inc., 460 U.S. 204, 208, 75 L. Ed. 2d 1, 103 S. Ct. 1042 (1983). None of these cases is analogous 
to the facts here. In joining the Multistate Settlement Agreement, the States did not enter the tobacco market as a buyer or 
seller, nor did they assume control or ownership of any entity within the market. If we had found Parker immunity, the States' 
actions would not fall under the market participant exception to Parker immunity."

rights under 42 U.S.C. § 1983; (12) anti-competitive conduct; (13) outrageous conduct; (14) abuse of process; and (15) arbitrary, capricious, and 
unreasonable conduct. "
632,3," The United States Supreme Court ""established a rigorous two-pronged test to determine whether anti-competitive conduct 
engaged in by private parties should be deemed state action and thus shielded from the antitrust laws. First, the challenged 
restraint must be 'one clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed as state policy.' Second, the anti-competitive conduct must 
be 'actively supervised' by the State itself."" Patrick, 486 U.S. at 100 (internal citations omitted)."
632,4," We do not include among the state law claims Nicholas's claim for anti-competitive conduct. The trial court correctly noted that 
Nicholas's sole and exclusive remedy for this claim is appeal to the CAC. See § 12-36.5-106(7). "
633,5," The QA Committee is a committee of the medical staff that assisted in investigating Nicholas. See North Colorado Medical 
Center Medical Staff Bylaws, § 8.3.g, at 22-23 (1989). The Credentials Subcommittee is a committee of NCMC whose express 
role includes the duty to ""investigate, review, and report on matters, including the clinical and ethical conduct of any member of 
the Medical staff or any Allied Health Professional as may be assigned or referred to it in accordance with policies and 
procedures established by the Board [of Directors]."" Bylaws of North Colorado Medical Center, Inc. 12 (1990). The Fair Hearing 
Panel was assembled by the Credentials Subcommittee for the express purpose of determining the scope of Nicholas's 
privileges. See North Colorado Medical Center Medical Staff Corrective Action/Fair Hearing Plan 6-13 (1988). "
635,6, The HCQIA sets forth detailed conditions for adequate notice and hearing in section 11112(b). 
636,7," The CPRA, however, does not share the HCQIA's presumption that professional review activities are undertaken for the 
purpose of assuring quality care and patient safety.  Nicholas II, 914 P.2d at 906."
636,8," The term ""professional review body"" in the CPRA is different from the term ""professional review committee."" The definition of 
""professional review body"" mirrors the definition in the HCQIA, see 42 U.S.C. § 11151(11), and applies only to the part of the 
CPRA discussing conformance with the HCQIA. See § 12-36.5-203(3)(b). We discuss the definition of ""professional review 
committees"" in Part II.C.2.b."
636,9," During the 1993 hearing on anti-competitive conduct, the CAC concluded that Nicholas's peer review process was not 
conducted in good faith as a quality assurance measure. See Nicholas I, 902 P.2d at 466. We do not view this conclusion or the 
cases affirming it as binding collateral estoppel. The CAC's role in professional review actions is ""limited to the sole issue of "
637,," whether [the] final board action resulted from unreasonable anticompetitive conduct."" § 12-36.5-106(7). The first opportunity for 
the parties to conduct a full and fair hearing on the immunity issue did not occur until the trial court's hearing in January 1998."
637,10," The CPRA does not define ""peer review committee."" However, it does provide that ""Any peer review committee established or 
created by a combination or pooling of any of the organizations authorized by"" the CPRA to establish professional review 
committees is itself a professional review committee. § 12-36.5-104(4)(h). Because peer review committees are thus subsets of 
professional review committees, we conclude that peer review committees are professional review committees that are primarily 
composed of physicians. Neither the Board of Directors nor its House Committee meet this definition. "
638,11," Nicholas initially named two additional individual defendants, Richard Stenner and Pat Kern. Nicholas dropped all claims 
against Stenner and Kern during the immunity hearing."
638,12," According to testimony at the immunity hearing, Nicholas gave Kantner a black-and-white copy of an EKG with blue writing on 
it for review by the Credentials Subcommittee. Kantner's staff then made copies of the document and distributed them. The 
Subcommittee apparently inferred from the copies that Nicholas had impermissibly altered the original EKG. There is no 
evidence in the record that Kantner acted to mislead the Subcommittee. "
640,13," Because the petitioners are immune from suit under the first part of the CPRA, they also enjoy the lesser immunity from 
liability for damages. We nevertheless address this issue because it is so closely tied to our analysis under the HCQIA and the 
first part of the CPRA. See Parts II.B. and II.C.2. of this opinion. "
644,1," A more detailed description of the alleged facts relevant to this case, but not essential for the analysis of this motion, can be 
found in United States v. Microsoft Corp., 87 F. Supp. 2d 30 (D.D.C. 2000). This court does not feel that, for the purpose of this 
present motion, a lengthy discussion of the facts are necessary because this motion addresses only the issue of whether or not 
the plaintiffs have the ability bring their claims under G.L.c. 93A, § 9. "
646,2," In Boos, the Federal District Court abstained from ruling on the defendants' motion to dismiss and certified the following 
question to the Supreme Judicial Court: May an individual bring an action under M.  G.L.c. 93A, § 9 alleging a price-fixing conspiracy, where that individual is barred from 
bringing an action under federal antitrust statutes because she is an indirect purchaser within the meaning of Illinois Brick v. 
Illinois, 431 U.S. 720 [97 S. Ct. 2061, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707] (1977)? As the defendant notes in its memorandum in support of its motion to dismiss, the parties in Boos appeared to have settled the 
matter before the Supreme Judicial Court rendered an opinion."
646,3," This court notes that it would not be inconsistent to follow FTC cases with respect to defining ""unfair and deceptive"" acts and 
clarifying prohibited conduct, while not strictly applying Illinois Brick and allowing indirect purchasers to bring a claim under 
G.L.c. 93A, Section 9, that is based on anticompetitive misconduct. The first set of cases provides guidance as to what acts a 
claim may be based on, while Illinois Brick addresses who is permitted to bring an action. "
657,1," The district court did not announce the reasons for its decision in writing or on the record. Specific findings and conclusions 
would have been of great assistance to this court and the parties. "
658,2," HN11[
] Two other sources aid in determining the definition of a word. First, we may look to the declaration of legislative 
policy in passing the act, but ""we will not limit our interpretation of a statute by reference to a 'general declaration of purpose.'"" 
Price Dev. Co. v. Orem City, 2000 UT 26, P23, 995 P.2d 1237. In this case, the purpose of the act, as set forth in Utah Code 
Ann. § 76-10-912 (1999), is not instructive on how to define ""proper demand."" Second, ""we may 'seek guidance from the 
legislative history.'"" State v. Garcia, 965 P.2d 508, 512 (Utah Ct. App. 1998) (citation omitted). Unfortunately, the recorded 
legislative history sheds no light on the definition of ""proper demand."" "
659,3," The court in Gold Bond interpreted HN15[
] the federal antitrust CID requirement that ""each demand shall -- '(1) state the 
nature of the conduct constituting the alleged antitrust violation which is under investigation and the provision of law applicable 
thereto.'"" Gold Bond, 221 F. Supp. at 397 (quoting section 3(b)(1) of the Antitrust Civil Process Act (1962) (later codified at 15 
U.S.C.A. § 1312(b)(1) (1998)). The Utah counterpart is similar: ""Each demand shall state: (i) The nature of the activities under 
investigation, constituting the alleged antitrust violation, which may result in a violation of this act and the applicable provision of 
law."" Utah Code Ann. § 76-10-917(2)(a)(i) (1999). "
660,4," See generally, United States v. Markwood, 48 F.3d 969, 975-80 (6th Cir. 1995) (discussing when antitrust CIDs and other 
administrative subpoenas are enforceable)."
660,5," We discuss the ""reasonable cause to believe"" standard at length in the next part of this opinion. The State need only present 
some objective evidence, without consideration of accuracy or weight of that evidence, that supports the State's belief for that 
belief to be reasonable. "
661,6," A CID must include the following HN20[
] statements: (i) The nature of the activities under investigation, constituting the alleged antitrust violation, which may result in a violation of 
this act and the applicable provision of law; (ii) that the recipient is entitled to counsel; (iii) that the documents, materials, or testimony in response to the demand may be used in a civil or criminal proceeding; (iv) that if the recipient does not comply with the demand the Office of the Attorney General may compel compliance by 
appearance, upon reasonable notice to the recipient, before the district court in the judicial district wherein the recipient resides 
or does business and only upon a showing before that district court that the requirements of Subsection (7) have been met; (v) that the recipient has the right at any time before the return date of the demand, or within 30 days, whichever period is 
shorter, to seek a court order determining the validity of the demand; and (vi) that at any time during the proceeding the person may assert any applicable privilege. Utah Code Ann. § 76-10-917(2)(a)(i) to (vi) (1999). In addition, when the CID calls for ""responses to written interrogatories,"" as 
the CID issued to Brixen does, the CID must do the HN21[
] following: (i) state that each interrogatory shall be answered separately and fully in writing and under oath, unless the person objects to the 
interrogatory, in which event the reasons for objection shall be stated in lieu of an answer; (ii) state that the answers are to be signed by the person making them, and the objections are to be signed by the attorney 
making them; (iii) identify by name and address the individual at the Office of the Attorney General on whom answers and objections provided 
under this Subsection (2)(d) are to be served; and (iv) prescribe the date on or before which these answers and objections are to be served on the identified individual. Utah Code Ann. § 76-10-917(2)(d) (1999)."
661,7," Brixen, a corporate defendant, would have ""no privilege against self-incrimination."" Hyster Co. v. United States, 338 F.2d 183, 
187 (9th Cir. 1964). Further, HN22[
] ""the fourth amendment is satisfied if the subpoenaed party is allowed 'to question the 
reasonableness of the subpoena, before suffering any penalties for refusing to comply with it, by raising objections in an action 
in district court.'"" In re Criminal Investigation, 754 P.2d 633, 642 (Utah 1988) (quoting Donovan v. Lone Steer, Inc., 464 U.S. 
408, 415, 104 S. Ct. 769, 773, 78 L. Ed. 2d 567 (1984)). Here, the CID Statute satisfies this fourth amendment concern. See 
HN23[
]  Utah Code Ann. § 76-10-917(7)(a), -917 (7)(b)(i) (1999) (allowing CID recipient to petition to set aside CID, and 
requiring AG to meet the CID Test to compel compliance even if CID recipient merely refuses to comply). The dissent raises some legitimate concerns about the criminal context. However, these concerns were not presented to the 
district court nor ruled on below. Further, they were not briefed or argued by the parties on appeal. "
662,8," HN25[
] Concerns about whether a sufficient nexus connects the CID recipient to the antitrust violation are dealt with under 
prongs one and three of the CID Test. The first prong evaluates whether the CID recipient has information relevant to an 
investigation, and the third prong evaluates whether the CID recipient has information relevant to a violation. The nexus required does not demand that there be reasonable cause to believe that the CID recipient is a ""conspirator."" The 
CID recipient only need be in ""possession, custody, or control of any information relevant to a civil antitrust violation."" Utah Code 
Ann. § 76-10-917(1) (1999). Possessors of relevant information may be completely innocent and unaware of antitrust violations. 
Nonetheless, they could possess relevant information. Thus, for a CID to be enforceable, the State need not show that the CID 
recipient has any connection to the antitrust violation beyond ""possession, custody, or control of any information relevant to"" the 
violation. Id. (emphasis added)."
662,9," Although stare decisis mandates that we follow the supreme court's reliance on Babbit to interpret the ""reasonable cause to 
believe"" standard, we note that the language of the Arizona statute contains a slight difference. The Utah statute requires a 
finding of ""reasonable cause to believe that there has been a violation,"" Utah Code Ann. § 76-10-917(7)(b)(ii) (1999) (emphasis 
added), while the Arizona statute mandates a finding of ""reasonable cause to believe there may have been a violation."" Arizona 
Uniform State Antitrust Act, Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 44-1406(B) (2000) (emphasis added); Evans, 963 P.2d at 181 n.5. Thus, it is 
possible that the Arizona Legislature set a lower burden than the Utah Legislature. "
663,10," We note that, since Evans, the supreme court lowered the probable cause standard for preliminary hearings, equating it with 
the standard required for an arrest warrant. See State v. Clark, 2001 UT 9, P16, 20 P.3d 300. At a preliminary hearing, the court 
""views all evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution and must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the 
prosecution."" Id. at P10. Probable cause then requires ""believable evidence of all the elements of the crime charged."" Id. at P15 
(internal quotations and citation omitted). The quantum of evidence required of the State is ""sufficient evidence to support a 
reasonable belief that an offense has been committed and that the defendant committed it."" Id. at P16."
663,11," While some concerns may arise about protections for CID recipients, the supreme court in Evans remarked that ""the higher 
protections afforded by higher standards are not necessary because CIDs are part of an investigation rather than an 
enforcement action."" Evans, 963 P.2d at 183 (emphasis added). If an ""investigation uncovers evidence, the State would initiate a 
civil action which would require the State to satisfy the higher standards before any sanctions are imposed."" Id. Further, ""the 
statute . . . gives the State broad discretion to investigate possible antitrust violations while at the same time protecting citizens 
from investigations not supported by reasonable cause."" Id."
663,12," HN29[
] Unless the State has received consent from the person who is the source, the State is prohibited from revealing the 
sources of its information to anyone but grand juries and law enforcement agencies. See Utah Code Ann. § 76-10-917(8) (1999). 
Thus, the State cannot respond to inquiries about its sources of information for the affidavit in a hearing which challenges the 
validity of the CID."
663,13," The AG's investigator presented information after interviewing several people and reviewing several documents. The 
Investigator described his sources in the following manner: "
664,," During this investigation, I have interviewed over twenty individuals familiar with the sale of door hardware via bidding for 
installation in public buildings. The individuals interviewed include representatives of a major manufacturer of door hardware, 
distributors of door hardware, school district officials, architects, and the Utah Division of Facilities and Construction 
Management (DFCM). In addition, I have reviewed documents received from a Utah college, school districts, and DFCM as well 
as documents received from two Salt Lake architectural firms pursuant to Civil Investigative Demands issued to the architectural 
firms."
664,14," We note that the federal antitrust statute is nearly identical to the Utah counterpart: ""Every contract, combination in the form of 
trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is hereby 
declared to be illegal."" 15 U.S.C. § 1 (1997). Thus, we look to the expansive body of federal antitrust law for guidance in 
evaluating a civil antitrust claim under the Utah Antitrust Act."
664,15," The bulk of the evidence considered by the supreme court in Evans was contained in the antitrust investigator's affidavit. See 
Evans, 963 P.2d at 183-84. "
667,1," In addition, the concerns expressed by the trial court relative to, among other things, the absence of objective evidence 
implicate the constitutional considerations contained herein. "
668,2," Although a CID is not issued in the ""name of the court or judge,"" the CID ""carries with it a command dignified by the sanction of 
the law."" 81 Am. Jur. 2d, Witnesses § 7 (2000)."
668,3," The majority notes that corporations do not have a right against self incrimination, see Braswell v. United States, 487 U.S. 99, 
102, 108 S. Ct. 2284, 2287, 101 L. Ed. 2d 98 (1988); however, CIDs may be issued to natural persons as well as corporations. 
Moreover, ""the fourth amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures protects both individuals and 
corporations."" In re Criminal Investigation, 754 P.2d 633, 642 (Utah 1988)."
668,4," In addition, the definition of, and penalties for, illegal anticompetitive activities are contained in the Utah Criminal Code. See 
Utah Code Ann. §§ 76-10-914, 76-10-920 (Supp. 2000). "
669,5," The supreme court's view that CIDs are used solely for civil actions is further evidenced by the fact that the court adopted the 
""sound reasoning and the sensible definition of 'reasonable cause' elucidated by the Babbit court."" 963 P.2d at 182. In Babbitt v. 
Herndon, 119 Ariz. 454, 581 P.2d 688 (Ariz. 1978), the Supreme Court of Arizona interpreted the reasonable cause standard of 
Arizona's Consumer Fraud Act. See id. However, unlike section 76-10-917, Arizona's Consumer Fraud Act does not provide for 
criminal penalties. See Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 44-1407 (2000) (stating ""attorney general may bring an action for appropriate injunctive 
or other equitable relief and civil penalties""). Thus, the Utah Supreme Court adopted a standard appropriate for civil actions 
when it utilized the reasonable cause definition contained in Babbitt. See Babbitt 581 P.2d at 692. Further, section 76-10-917 
creates some confusion by providing for issuance of a CID ""prior to the commencement of a civil action."" Utah Code Ann. 76-10-
917(1) (1996). It is not clear whether the statute refers to the results of the investigation or an action to enforce the CID."
669,6," Incredibly, the Babbit court deemed evidence ""sufficient,"" regardless of its accuracy.  Babbit 581 P.2d at 692."
669,7," Article I, Section 12 of the Utah Constitution states that a person accused of a crime ""shall not be compelled to give evidence 
against himself"" and, ""in no instance shall any accused person, before final judgment, be compelled to advance money or fees 
to secure the rights herein granted."" Utah Const. art. I, § 12. "
670,8," A CID is statutorily authorized, formally served and issued by the attorney general. See Utah Code Ann. § 76-10-917 (1999)."
670,9," The majority cites In re Criminal Investigation, 754 P.2d at 642 (quoting Donovan v. Lone Steer, Inc., 464 U.S. 408, 415, 104 S. 
Ct. 769, 773, 78 L. Ed. 2d 567 (1984)) for the proposition that the Fourth Amendment requires only that the CID recipient have 
the opportunity to challenge a CID after it is issued. I consider the majority's reliance on these cases misplaced because, unlike 
section 76-10-917, the subpoenas at issue in both of these cases contained pre-issuance protections. First, the type of 
subpoena at issue in In re Criminal Investigation, contained the pre- issuance protection that ""the overall investigation may be 
approved only after the district court has made an objective determination that 'good cause' has been shown."" 754 P.2d at 643-
44 (stating that ""the only plausible reason for requiring a good cause showing is to limit the scope of the authorized investigation 
accordingly""). Moreover, the statute governing the type of subpoenas at issue in In re Criminal Investigation was subsequently 
amended to require that the prosecutor ""apply to the district court for each subpoena."" Utah Code Ann. § 77-22-2(3)(b)(i) (2000). 
Second, the administrative subpoena at issue in Donovan v. Lone Steer, Inc. is governed by the safeguards provided under 18 
U.S.C. § 6002 (2001). Specifically, section 6002 states that once a person refuses to testify or provide other information on the 
basis of his privilege against self-incrimination, ""no testimony or other information compelled under the order (or any information 
directly or indirectly derived from such testimony or other information) may be used against the witness in a criminal case."" 18 
U.S.C. § 6002 (2001). While this protection would not protect a corporation, such a distinction is irrelevant to my analysis 
because CIDs may be issued to natural persons. "
671,10," Only after a CID recipient fails to comply or petitions the court to modify or set aside the CID must the attorney general 
demonstrate that the information demanded is relevant to the suspected antitrust violation. See id. § 76-10-917(7)(b)(ii). 
However, this requirement does not prevent the attorney general from searching through the demanded documents for evidence 
of other crimes regardless of whether these crimes were within the scope of the CID."
671,11," Although decided under the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution, Article I, Section 14 of the Utah Constitution 
contains language identical to the Fourth Amendment. Compare U.S. Const. amend IV, with Utah Const. art. I, § 14."
671,12," For example, on several occasions the trial court asked the assistant attorney general whether he had documents to support 
allegations contained in the affidavit."
671,13," While the attorney general did claim to possess such information, it is not enough to merely possess the information. The 
attorney general must present enough objective evidence to satisfy the court that there is ""reasonable cause to believe that there 
has been a violation of this act."" Utah Code Ann. § 76-10-917(7)(b)(ii) (1999). "
676,1," Other state law claims were pled. However, they were dismissed prior to the circuit court's granting summary judgment on the 
appellants' antitrust claims. The dismissal of those claims has not been addressed by the appellants on appeal. "
677,2," 7 U.S.C. § 608c(5)(F) (Law Co-op. 1992 & Supp. 2001). All other citations to federal statutes are to the same edition of 
U.S.C.S."

] Milk marketing orders can also be established through state milk marketing systems. See, e.g., Knevelbaard Dairies v. Kraft Foods, Inc., 232 F.3d 979 (9th Cir. 2000). Therefore, the federal government has not preempted the field for 
establishing milk orders, and cases such as Florida Lime & Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul, 373 U.S. 132, 10 L. Ed. 2d 248, 
83 S. Ct. 1210 (1963), which turn on whether preemption has occurred, are not helpful to our analysis."
677,4, 7 U.S.C. § 601et seq. 
679,5," Servais claims that the manipulation was not solely of the National Cheese Exchange prices. However, that assertion does not 
change our analysis because we cannot look underneath the minimum pay prices set in the milk orders, regardless of the acts 
alleged to have caused an invalid price. To do as Servais requests would necessarily involve us in determining a reasonable 
rate for that milk order, and this we cannot do.  Arkansas Louisiana Gas Co. v. Hall, 453 U.S. 571, 577, 69 L. Ed. 2d 856, 101 
S. Ct. 2925 (1981). "
769,1," The background set forth below is specifically taken from the public version of the plaintiffs' Consolidated Amended Class 
Action Complaint filed on December 23, 1999 (""Compl."")."
769,2," The Complaint specifically alleges restraint of trade on clorazepate and lorazepam, conspiracy to monopolize the generic 
lorazepam and clorazepate tablets markets, monopolization of the generic lorazepam and clorazepate tablets markets, 
attempted monopolization of the generic lorazepam and clorazepate tablets markets, and price fixing agreement on lorazepam 
API. See Compl. PP 63-96. "
771,3," HN3[
] Section 4 of the Clayton Act provides in pertinent part: Any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue 
therefor in any district court of the United States in the district in which the defendant resides or is found or has an agent, 
without respect to the amount in controversy, and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained, and the cost of 
suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee."
771,15, U.S.C. § 15. 
772,4," The defendants manufactured and distributed concrete block to masonry contractors, who in turn submitted bids to general 
contractors for the masonry potion of construction projects. The general contractors would then submit bids for these projects to 
their customers such as the plaintiff State of Illinois. See Illinois Brick, 431 U.S. at 726-27. "
775,5," Cf. Esplin v. Hirschi, 402 F.2d 94, 99 (10th Cir. 1968) (""If there is to be an error made, let it be in favor and not against the 
maintenance of the class action, for it is always subject to modification should later developments during the course of the trial 
so require."") (citing Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 391 F.2d 555, 566 (2d Cir. 1968)); accord Green v. Wolf Corp., 406 F.2d 291, 
298, 301 (2d Cir. 1968); In re Sumitomo Copper Litig., 182 F.R.D. 85, 88 (S.D.N.Y. 1998); Playmobil, 35 F. Supp. 2d at 239). "
776,6," For example, the defendants state that in each transaction for which an entity (e.g., a GPO member like St. Charles) would 
claim a ""contract"" with Mylan, a different entity usually would be ""invoiced"" by Mylan (e.g., a wholesaler like Dik Drugs). But the 
data lacks crucial information for making a proper standing choice between these entities, such as the sequence of the 
transaction's negotiations, shipment, payment, etc. See Defs' Reply at 19."
776,7," Exhibit 1 to the plaintiffs' joint motion for class certification is the affidavit of Professor Richard G. Frank, the Margaret T. Morris 
Professor of Health Economics at Harvard University Medical School. [Redacted]. "
777,8," In fairness, the defendants have taken measured steps to distinguish their argument from the latter absurdity by arguing that 
the plaintiffs' definition and proposed representatives, in particular, fail in light of the data at hand. However, further evidence to 
the Court that the defendants' arguments are implicitly tantamount to the same thing is defense counsel's inability, in response to 
the Court's questioning at the hearing, to either hypothesize a direct purchaser that would have standing in this case or concede 
that at least one of the named plaintiffs has standing. "
778,9," Market makers are securities middlemen whose profits stem primarily from the spread--that is, the difference between the bid 
price (to buy) and the ask price (to sell) for a given security, which is typically one-eighth point. See NASDAQ, 169 F.R.D. at 
501-02. "
779,10," The Court additionally notes that the proper allocation of damages to the proper plaintiffs can be made a later time, and if 
necessary, with the aid of subclasses. See, e.g., Herbst v. International Tel. & Tel. Corp., 495 F.2d 1308, 1321 (2d Cir. 1974) (""If 
it appears at some time in the future that the proper allocation of damages would be effectuated by the designation of 
appropriate subclasses, it is undisputed that the court has all the power necessary to implement such a procedure. Fed. R. Civ. 
P. 23(c)(4). In any event, problems well down the road which may be pertinent to the procedures which ultimately should govern 
the allocation of damages need not and should not provide a roadblock to the prompt and conditional determination of whether 
this suit may be properly maintained as a class action."") (footnote omitted); see Blackie v. Barrack, 524 F.2d 891, 909 (9th Cir. 
1975) (""Courts have generally declined to consider conflicts, particularly as they regard damages, sufficient to defeat class 
action status at the outset unless the conflict is apparent, imminent, and on an issue at the very heart of the suit.""); Sol S. Turnoff 
Drug Distributors, Inc. v. N.V. Nederlandsche Combinatie Voor Chemische Industrie, 51 F.R.D. 227 (E.D. Pa. 1970) (""At least at 
this stage of the case, all the members of the class . . . have a common interest in a favorable verdict on the issue of a 
conspiracy. . . . The possibility . . . that it may develop that the interests with respect to damages of several groups within the 
class . . . will conflict, cannot at this point justify the denial of a class action."") quoted in NASDAQ, 169 F.R.D. at 514 (additionally 
noting that ""if real antagonism later develops among the interests of various class members, the problem could be addressed 
through the creation of subclasses under Rule 23(c)(4)""). "

] To prevail on their monopolization claims, the plaintiffs must similarly establish (1) possession of monopoly power in 
the relevant market, (2) willful acquisition or maintenance of that power, and (3) antitrust injury. See, e.g., Austin v. McNamara, 
979 F.2d 728, 739 (9th Cir. 1992). "
794,1," In Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir. 1981), the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit adopted as 
binding precedent all decisions that the former Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit rendered before October 1, 1981. Additionally, the end payors lack standing to pursue their federal claims under the balancing test that the Supreme Court 
articulated in Associated General Contractors v. California State Council of Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 534-47, 74 L. Ed. 2d 723, 
103 S. Ct. 897 (1983). HN3[
] As the phrase ""indirect purchasers"" connotes, there is an attenuated causal connection between 
the defendants' agreements and the end payors' alleged injury. Other entities, i.e., the direct purchasers, may have sustained 
more direct injuries from the defendants' agreements. The indirect purchasers' complaint raises the spectre of an extremely 
complex apportionment of damages. Each of these concerns led the Supreme Court to conclude that the plaintiffs in Associated 
General Contractors lacked standing under the Clayton Act, id. at 545-46, and the same conclusion is appropriate with respect 
to the indirect purchaser plaintiffs in this case."
794,2," The jurisdictions and statutes cited are Arizona, California, Florida, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New 
Mexico, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, South Dakota, Tennessee, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and the 
District of Columbia. (Id. at 35-39.) As the end payors have abandoned their New York claims, (Pls.' Opp'n at 28 n.13), those 
claims in Counts Two, Four, and Six will be dismissed with prejudice. "
795,3," Church v. City of Huntsville, 30 F.3d 1332, 1336 (11th Cir. 1994). Abbott, Geneva, and Zenith did not move to dismiss the 
direct purchasers' complaint for lack of standing. When Zenith later moved for summary judgment against the direct purchasers 
on standing grounds, the Court determined that it would permit the parties to complete discovery and deferred ruling on the 
issue, denying Zenith's motion without prejudice. See In re Terazosin Hydrochloride Antitrust Litig., 164 F. Supp. 2d 1340, 1347 
(drawing ""no conclusion regarding whether the plaintiffs have suffered an antitrust injury"")."

generally U.S. CONST. art. 3, § 2; Cone Corp. v. Florida Dep't of Transp., 921 F.2d 1190, 1203 (11th Cir. 1991). "
796,5," Whereas none of the named plaintiffs allegedly ""paid more for [generic] terazosin"" in California, Kansas, Tennessee, or the 
District of Columbia, see supra page 6, the Court also will dismiss Counts Two, Four, and Six to the extent that they seek 
damages for overpriced generic terazosin hydrochloride under the laws of those jurisdictions. See, e.g., D.C. CODE ANN. § 28-
4501 (providing right of action against antitrust conspiracies restraining commerce ""within the District of Columbia""); KAN. STAT. 
ANN. § 50-112 (prohibiting contracts that ""tend to prevent full and free competition in the importation, transportation or sale of

material""); TENN. CODE ANN. § 47-25-101 (same); see also supra note 4 and accompanying text (discussing standing 
requirements); infra pages 15-20 (reviewing Tennessee and California claims based on Hytrin purchases and concluding that 
end payors have further failed to state a claim under Tennessee law). "
798,6," McLaughlin v. Abbott Laboratories, No. CV-95-0628, slip. op. (Ariz. Super. Ct. Yavapai Cty., July 9, 1996), cited by the end 
payors, is unpersuasive because it overlooks and contradicts the state Court of Appeals' statement that the Arizona legislature 
strove for ""uniformity between federal and state antitrust laws"" in enacting the Antitrust Act. Wedgewood Inv. Corp., 613 P.2d 
at 623. Without citation to legislative history, McLaughlin assumes that the provision that judges ""may use as a guide 
interpretations given by the federal courts to comparable federal antitrust statutes,"" ARIZ. REV. STAT. § 44-1412, applies only to 
federal cases decided before 1974. McLaughlin, slip. op. at 2. The Illinois Brick rule hardly frustrates the Arizona Constitution's 
provision that ""monopolies and trusts shall never be allowed,"" ARIZ. CONST. art, 14 § 15, rather, it seeks to simplify private 
litigation against unlawful combines. Additionally, the end payors report that another Arizona trial court rejected the Illinois Brick rule in Friedman v. Microsoft Corp., 
No. CV-00-0722 (Super. Ct. Ariz. Maricopa Cty., Nov. 15, 2000), but they have not submitted a copy of that unpublished 
decision for review, and it is not presently available on electronic databases or the Superior Court's web site. "
800,7," As previously noted, Valentine lacks standing to assert claims pertaining to generic Hytrin. See supra note 5. Amending the 
complaint to correct this deficiency would be futile for the reasons discussed above."
800,8," Like Tennessee, HN17[
] West Virginia permits indirect purchaser actions. See W. VA. CODE ST. R. 142-9-1-2 (""Persons 
who are indirectly injured by violations of the West Virginia Antitrust Act . . . [may] maintain an action for damages.""). The 
defendants' assertion that West Virginia courts would follow Illinois Brick is incorrect. "
801,9," Somewhat paradoxically, the end payors also argue that ""all of the relevant transactions took place solely within Tennessee."" 
(Pls.' Supp. Mem. at 3.) This argument is unavailing because the phrase ""transactions"" must refer to the actions taken by the 
defendants. See TENN. CODE ANN. § 47-25-102 (prohibiting ""arrangements"" to restrain competition); Blake, 1996 Tenn. App.

819,3," The Pennsylvania Supreme Court reached a similar conclusion. While it ruled the Pennsylvania Insurance Department had 
followed the appropriate procedures when approving the division, it was careful to explain that ""no judicial remedies are 
foreclosed by the department's approval of the plan of restructure and division. Such claims were outside the jurisdiction of the

846,13," HN10[
] The act of state doctrine does not, however, completely deprive the courts of jurisdiction to examine the validity of a 
foreign state's acts. The Supreme Court has noted that ""sometimes, even though the validity of the act of a foreign sovereign 
within its own territory is called into question, the policies underlying the act of state doctrine may not justify its application."" W.S. 
Kirkpatrick & Co., 493 U.S. at 409. Absent such extraordinary circumstances, however, courts in the United States have the 
power, and ordinarily the obligation, to decide cases and controversies properly presented to them,"" id., even when the outcome 
of the case turns upon the effect of a foreign sovereign's acts taken within its own territory. "
847,14," According to the Court's formulation of the principle in Hilton, comity describes the broader principle to which the revenue rule 
arguably provides an exception. In other words, absent the revenue rule, the effect to be given by a U.S. court to a foreign tax 
judgment or another sovereign's tax legislation would be decided according to principles of comity. "
848,15," See, e.g., Erwin Chemerinsky, Federal Jurisdiction § 2.6.1 (3d ed. 1999) (""These criteria seem useless in identifying what 
constitutes a political question.""). "
854,16," At oral argument on May 25, 2001 counsel for the Philip Morris Defendants expressed, in the following words, his fear that a 
trial in this case would present insurmountable difficulties due to the necessity of interpreting foreign tax laws: As hard as it was for the Court, and the Court obviously has been extremely conscientious, tried very hard, listened very 
carefully, asked very probing questions, and is clearly trying to understand the legal systems in fifteen member states, the 
E.C., the Republic of Colombia and the Departments. Think about what a jury is going to be like [hearing] a case [and 
attempting] to analyze the tax laws of these multiple jurisdictions, with all kinds of arcana, totally foreign to us. (May 25, 2001 Tr. at 528.) Although I agree with counsel that the interpretation of foreign law poses a significant challenge, I am 
confident that this court is up to the task. Moreover, the jury would play no role in the interpretation of foreign tax statutes which, 
pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 44.1, is an issue of law to be decided by the court. See infra n.21. "
857,17," The dictionary definition of the word ""entity"" is ""being"" or ""existence."" Webster's Coll. Dictionary (10th ed. 1999). That definition 
is unhelpfully over-expansive, and so I assume Congress understood the term as used in legal contexts. Cf. Zicherman v. 
Korean Air Lines Co., 516 U.S. 217, 222, 133 L. Ed. 2d 596, 116 S. Ct. 629 (1996) (rejecting the natural and ordinary meaning of 
""damage"" when it would produce overbroad and nonsensical results); Jarecki v. G.D. Searle & Co., 367 U.S. 303, 307-09, 6 L. 
Ed. 2d 859, 81 S. Ct. 1579 (1961) (adopting a more technical interpretation of the word ""discovery"" because of its overbroad 
ordinary meaning). I note in passing, however, that this broad definition would naturally include foreign governmental entities. "
858,18," Although many courts ultimately refuse to hold the governmental units liable as RICO defendants, see Frooks, 997 F. Supp. at 
457 (compiling cases), those dispositions turn not on whether the entities considered are ""persons,"" but rather on whether they 
could fulfill other elements of the RICO liability case, see, e.g., Nu-Life, 779 F. Supp. at 251 (finding the City of New York to be 
clearly within RICO's definition of ""person"" but nonetheless holding that the City could not be liable because it was incapable of 
forming the intent necessary to establish its commission of two predicate acts). "
859,19," Relying on Evans, the Bonnano court itself deliberately restricted its reasoning to the United States by noting that the United 
States has unique avenues of redress under RICO unavailable to other governments. See Bonanno, 879 F.2d at 25. "
861,20," Further, I see little reason why RICO could not be read as permitting, as an initial inquiry, all ""persons"" both to sue and be 
sued, but then allowing certain defenses, such as immunity, to factor into the analysis as applicable. In other words, a foreign 
sovereign or a state may be a RICO ""person"" as defined by the language of the statute but nevertheless immune from being a 
RICO defendant on other grounds. Accordingly, even if Defendants are correct in asserting that ""person"" means the same for 
both RICO plaintiffs and RICO defendants, the concerns they express are not inextricably implicated."
861,21," As discussed infra, it is not clear to me that a distinction can be maintained between the ""competitive injury"" rejected by the 
Supreme Court in Sedima and the ""commercial injury"" that Defendants would have this court require. Defendants themselves 
offer no distinction except for their conclusory statement that ""there is a world of difference between a 'competitive' injury and a 
'commercial' one."" (Defs.' Joint Reply Mem. in Support of Mot. to Dismiss Amazonas and EC Compls. Under 12(b)(6) at 14 n.7.) 
Neither Defendants nor any court of which I am aware have ever articulated this ""world of difference."" To the contrary, though 
frequently appearing in the disjunctive, the terms nevertheless appear to embody the same idea. See, e.g., Sedima, 473 U.S. at 
486 n.6; Bennett v. Berg, 685 F.2d 1053, 1059 (8th Cir. 1981) (""We conclude that an allegation of commercial or competitive 
injury is not required by the RICO Act.); Bunker Ramo Corp. v. United Bus. Forms, Inc., 713 F.2d 1272, 1288 (7th Cir. 1983) 
(""This court held that competitive or commercial injury is not required in order to state a RICO civil claim.""); Margolis v. Republic "
862,," Nat'l Bank of N.Y., 585 F. Supp. 595, 597 (S.D.N.Y. 1984) (""We agree that such an injury should not be equated to the sort of 
'competitive or commercial injury' which must be shown in an antitrust case.""). Nevertheless, for the purposes of discussing the 
Sedima opinion, I assume arguendo that the concepts are capable of meaningful dissociation. "
867,22," On May 24 and 25, 2001 I held a hearing, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 44.1, in order to supplement the record concerning 
whether or not, as a matter of law, Plaintiffs in the EC and Amazonas Cases had adequately alleged proximate cause, as 
required under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c) and Holmes, 503 U.S. 258, 117 L. Ed. 2d 532, 112 S. Ct. 1311 (the ""44.1 Hearing""). (See 
May 3, 2001 Order at 3.) Plaintiffs and Defendants were invited to present expert testimony on relevant foreign law issues. The 
parties's experts made written submissions in advance of the 44.1 Hearing, which I considered in addition to their oral testimony. 
My interpretations, as set forth herein, are based on the experts' averments and upon my own research into the organization and 
proper interpretation EC law. I note that I have considered foreign law in this case only to the extent necessary to decide 
Defendants' motions to dismiss. "
868,23," The EC moves to join the following Member States as party plaintiffs in the EC Case: the Kingdom of Belgium, the Republic of 
Finland, the French Republic, the Hellenic Republic, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Italian Republic, the Grand Duchy of 
Luxembourg, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the Portuguese Republic, and the Kingdom of Spain. "
877,1," While both parties refer to a monopsony, the correct term would actually be oligopsony, which refers to a group of buyers with 
market power that collude to depress the price of one or more key inputs used in their production processes. See Roger D. Blair, 
Antitrust Policy and Monopsony, 76 Cornell L. Rev. 297 (1991). As Soundview utilizes the term monopsony, as do a number of 
the relevant cases, however, this Court will follow suit. "
880,2," After oral argument, Sony submitted a recent decision from the Southern District of New York dismissing an antitrust claim, 
Floors-N-More, Inc. v. Freight Liquidators, 142 F. Supp. 2d 496, 2001 WL 533209 (S.D.N.Y. 2001). Floors-N-More cited to the 
Second Circuit's opinion in George Haug Co. v. Rolls Royce Motor Cars Inc., 148 F.3d 136, 139 (2d Cir. 1998) for the statement 
that ""in an antitrust action, it is not . . . proper to assume that the [plaintiff] can prove facts that it has not alleged or that the 
defendants have violated the antitrust laws in ways that have not been set forth in the complaint."" 142 F. Supp. 2d at 499, 2001 
WL 533209 at *2. Neither George Haug nor Floors-N-More involved patent claims, however, or factual allegations supporting 
claims of a conspiracy to fix prices and a concerted refusal to deal. In the Floors-N-More case, the district court noted that the 
plaintiffs failed to ""provide a single fact"" in support of their conspiracy allegation, and in George Haug Co., the plaintiff claims that 
competition had been harmed due simply to the defendant's termination of it as an authorized dealer, without any facts which 
allowed an inference that plaintiff's termination resulted in market concentration, reduced the number of outlets, or in any other 
way harmed competition. See George Haug Co. v. Rolls Royce Motor Cars, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13650, No. 96 CIV 3140, 
1997 WL 563806 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 10, 1997). Soundview's facts exceed those that appear to have been alleged in both Floors-N-
More and George Haug, and thus this Court need not rely solely on conclusory statements or assumptions about unpleaded 
facts. "

888,4," Although Universal refers to Collins shipsets as ""flight control systems,"" the FCS is part of the Pro Line 4 and 21 shipset; it 
does not comprise the entire unit. Collins has accepted Universal's nomenclature for purposes of the pending motions."
888,5," Universal's Complaint alleges only an attempt to monopolize and not actual monopolization. Universal does not adequately 
defend its delay in raising this claim. Because of the prejudice to Collins, the Court would not be inclined to grant Universal leave 
to amend under Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(b). In any event, an amendment would be futile because Universal's actual monopolization 
claim would fail. As will be explained herein, Universal cannot show monopoly power under the relevant market alleged in it's 
Complaint. See Image Technical Services, Inc. v. Eastman Kodak Co., 125 F.3d 1195, 1202 (9th Cir.1997) (The requirements of 
a monopolization claim are similar to those of an attempted monopolization, differing primarily in the requisite intent and the 
necessary level of monopoly power. To prove actual monopolization, a plaintiff must prove that the defendant possessed 
monopoly power in the relevant market and willfully acquired or maintained that power. Both claims require a showing of 
monopoly or market power in a relevant market.). "
889,6," ""Retrofits"" are installations of new parts or equipment not installed at the time of manufacturing. For example, an end-customer 
who has a Collins FMS installed on their aircraft and wishes to replace it with a non-Collins FMS, can ""retrofit"" the non-Collins 
FMS into the aircraft. If an end-customer takes delivery of the aircraft from the OEMs factory with no FMS installed, they can 
likewise ""retrofit"" their aircraft with an FMS at a completion center at some point after they have taken delivery of the aircraft. "
890,7," Professor Smith also testified that he did not believe that Collins could monopolize the FMS market on general aviation aircraft, 
the relevant market pled by Universal in its Complaint."
890,8," The Court finds no merit to Universal's argument that it denied the existence of a lock-in market in response to Collins' 
Requests for Admissions because Collins did not specify that it was asking whether the market was for FMSs to be used with an 
""integrated"" Collins FCSs. Universal's Opposition at 37-40. Nor does the Court find that the parties tried issues outside of the 
pleadings ""by express or implied consent,"" thus legitimizing an amendment under Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(b)."
890,9, Universal is not able to establish improper conduct on the part of Collins in the general aviation market. See infra n.7.
890,10," The record in this matter is massive. While the Court faults the attorneys on both sides, Universal must take more of the 
blame. In an effort to simplify and organize the record into a more workable condition, the Court ordered counsel for both sides 
to confer and submit a joint statement of undisputed and disputed material facts. Unfortunately, this resulted in the filing of yet 
another imposing document consisting of 277 pages. Few facts were really agreed upon. Universal refused to admit even 
routine introductory facts and went as far as to deny facts it had previously alleged in earlier pleadings. Wherever possible, the 
Court will refer and cite to this joint statement as ""JSF [paragraph number] at [page number]."" When the parties could not agree 
whether a fact was or was not disputed, they recited their respective position. When the Court refers to any of these facts as 
""undisputed,"" it means that the Court has reviewed both parties' positions and determined that the fact is in reality an undisputed 
fact. "
891,11," When Kodak first sold its photocopiers, it relied on purchasers to obtain service from independent service providers. Later, 
Kodak used its market power in unique replacement parts to squeeze the independent service providers out of the repair market 
and force purchasers to obtain higher priced service from Kodak. Because the change in policy was not foreseen at the time of 
sale, purchasers had no way of calculating the higher service cost into their purchasing decision. Thus, Kodak involved three 
independent products: the Kodak copiers (the ""lock-in"" product), the Kodak copier replacement parts (the ""tying"" product), and 
the Kodak copier servicing and repair (the ""tied"" product). The Court in Kodak was asked to determine whether parts and 
services could be distinct products for antitrust purposes and whether a defendant's lack of market power in the primary 
equipment market precluded as a matter of law the potential for market power in derivative aftermarkets. Since Kodak's servicing 
competitors had produced evidence of high switching costs for Kodak copier owners, the Kodak Court concluded that such ""lock-
ins"" could help the competitors establish Kodak's appreciable economic power in the derivative ""tying"" aftermarket for Kodak 
parts. The Court in Kodak accordingly held that the undetermined ""information costs"" and ""switching costs"" presented material 
issues of fact, and if genuinely disputed, would preclude summary judgment, even though Kodak lacked appreciable economic 
power in the ""lock-in"" product market for copiers. "

unjust enrichment; detrimental reliance; and conversion. "
925,6," See discussion infra, Part V, for an elaboration of the interstate commerce requirement. "
926,7," As the Supreme Court noted, ""to hold that the antitrust laws protect competitors from the loss of profits due to such price 
competition would, in effect, render illegal any decision by a firm to cut prices in order to increase market share. The antitrust 
laws require no such perverse result."" Cargill, Inc. v. Monfort of Colorado, Inc., 479 U.S. 104, 116, 93 L. Ed. 2d 427, 107 S. Ct. 
484 (1986). "
927,8," In their Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Defendant Daily News's Motion, the Carriers clarify that printing originates in New 
Jersey and sales are made nationwide. Although the Court need not look beyond the complaint in ruling on a motion to dismiss, 
the assertion that sales were made in interstate commerce appears in the original complaint, and there is clearly an issue of fact 
that cannot be resolved on a motion to dismiss and that should proceed to discovery. "
928,9," In FTC v. Morton Salt Co., 334 U.S. 37, 46-47, 92 L. Ed. 1196, 68 S. Ct. 822 (1948), the Supreme Court held that in secondary-
line price discrimination cases, competitive injury may be inferred from evidence of injury to an individual competitor. The Court 
explained that the Robinson-Patman Act was concerned with protecting small businesses and that § 2(a) was intended to allow 
evidence of injury to a competitor to suffice as evidence of injury to competition. See id. at 49. Furthermore, the inference was 
warranted because a substantial price difference over time creates a reasonable possibility of harm to competition itself. 
Although Brooke Group, clearly imposed a competitive injury requirement in primary-line price discrimination cases, the Morton 
Salt inference has continuing vitality in claims of secondary-line injury. "
929,10," The Carriers' Second cause of action also implicitly contains allegations of discriminatory advertising allowances in violation of 
§§ 2(d) and (e) of the Clayton Act. (See Compl. PP 46(c), 56-57). Because the requisite elements of §§ 2(d) and (e) claims 
substantially overlap with the elements of a secondary-line price discrimination, the above analysis applies to all three of the 
Carriers' claims in their Second cause of action. See Von Kalinowski, supra, § 5.10[2], at 5-123. In any event, the Daily News's 
Motion does not address discriminatory advertising allowances, and therefore, the Carriers' claims under §§ 2(a), (d) and (e) 
survive dismissal."
929,11," In Associated Gen., 459 U.S. at 534 & n.31, the Supreme Court identified additional factors for lower courts to consider in 
determining whether a particular plaintiff has standing to bring suit under the antitrust laws. Those factors include: (1) the causal 
connection between an antitrust violation and the alleged harm suffered by the plaintiff; (2) the nature of the plaintiff's antitrust 
injury; (3) the directness or remoteness of the asserted injury; (4) the existence of more direct and identifiable victims of the 
antitrust violation, other than the plaintiff; and (5) the potential for duplicative recovery or complex apportionment of damages. "
930,," See also In re Nine West Shoes, 80 F. Supp. 2d at 186. Because this Court holds that the Carriers have failed to sufficiently 
allege antitrust injury at all, a comprehensive analysis of standing under the Associated Gen. factors is unnecessary. "
935,12," See discussion supra, Part II. "
936,13," See discussion supra, Part VI.B. "
947,1," Defendant Manufacturers and Defendant Buyers as separate groups filed joint motions to dismiss Plaintiffs' complaint. Where 
necessary, the court will address each group's arguments individually. With respect to those arguments that are applicable to 
both Defendant Manufacturers and Defendant Buyers, however, the court will refer to Defendant Manufacturers and Defendant 
Buyers collectively as Defendants."
947,2," Plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23, seeking to represent all persons holding a quota to 
grow flue-cured or burley tobacco in the United States at any time from February 1996 to the present and all domestic producers 
of flue-cured or burley tobacco who sold such tobacco in the United States at any time from February 1996 to the present. The 
court will not address the issue of class certification at this time."
947,3," Plaintiffs' original complaint and first amended complaint focused on Defendants' efforts to undermine and/or eliminate the 
federal tobacco program. The initial complaints also centered on Defendant Manufacturers' participation in the Master 
Settlement Agreement of 1998 (the Master Settlement) entered into between fourteen states and tobacco manufacturers to 
settle litigation over health expenditures, as well as the National Tobacco Grower Settlement Trust (the Grower Trust) negotiated 
in conjunction with the Master Settlement. Plaintiffs have abandoned the claims related to these issues; the third amended 
complaint before the court alleges only two claims, for violations of sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. Though of 
understandable significance to Plaintiffs and Defendants, the terms of the Master Settlement and the Grower Trust and their 
extensive history are not the basis for Plaintiffs' antitrust claims. Thus, the court will not elaborate on their history in considering 
Defendants' motion to dismiss the third amended complaint. "
948,4," Plaintiffs allege that Defendant Manufacturers have unlawfully conspired to abuse their monopsony (actually, oligopsony, as 
there are several Defendant Manufacturers) power as buyers of tobacco. In the past, tobacco companies have been convicted of 
abusing their power both as market sellers and buyers. See  United States v. American Tobacco Co., 221 U.S. 106, 31 S. Ct. 
632, 55 L. Ed. 663 (1911). The distinctions among the various economic combinations will be discussed further below."
948,5," The legal requirements and authority for the federal tobacco program are set forth at 7 U.S.C. §§ 511, 723, 1311-1316, and 
1445. The majority of the current regulations were enacted in 1986. "
949,6," Plaintiffs allege that since 1997 Defendant Manufacturers have lowered their purchase intentions by 48 percent for flue-cured 
and burley tobacco combined. (Third Am. Compl. P 3B.) "
950,7," Plaintiffs in their third amended complaint state that ""Defendant Manufacturers currently purchase the overwhelming majority, 
well in excess of 70%, of tobacco in [the flue-cured and/or burley tobacco market in the United States]."" (Third Am. Compl. P 
56.) In the second amended complaint, Plaintiffs alleged that Defendant Manufacturers purchase approximately 96 percent of 
domestic tobacco. See Second Am. Compl. P 53. Nonetheless, Plaintiffs cite the same percentages for each Defendant 
Manufacturer in both complaints. Those figures add up to a minimum of 95 percent of tobacco purchases. "
951,8," Defendant Buyers adopted all of the reasons stated in Defendant Manufacturers' joint memorandum in support of their motion 
to dismiss the second amended complaint (Def. Buyers' Mem. Supp. Jt. Mot. Dis. at 1), simply arguing that Plaintiffs' factual 
allegations are even more insufficient with respect to Defendant Buyers. Thus, the court's analysis of Plaintiffs' section 1 claim 
applies to all Defendants. The court notes that Defendant Manufacturers did not submit a brief in support of dismissal of the third amended complaint, due 
to the fact that the third amended complaint differed substantively only in its addition of Defendant Buyers."
951,9," Defendants contend that, even if Plaintiffs' bid-rigging allegations survive dismissal, the court should ""dismiss the other, legally 
insufficient antitrust claims."" (Jt. Mot. Dis. Second Am. Compl. at 20.) However, the claims stated are for violations of sections 1 
and 2; the factual allegations are set forth in support of them and are not subject to dismissal. Therefore, the court will not 
consider whether certain allegations survive dismissal, but whether the two antitrust claims survive dismissal. "
952,10," It is not necessary to undertake a detailed explanation of the authors' economic analysis, as the court finds their theories 
consistent with past Supreme Court decisions. Nonetheless, the court notes that the basis of their analysis is economic studies 
that indicate monopsonists and oligopsonists do not pass on lower costs incurred in buying raw materials because ""the relevant 
costs for pricing decisions are marginal costs, and these are not lower."" Roger D. Blair & Jeffrey L. Harrison, Antitrust Policy and 
Monopsony, 76 CORNELL L. REV. 297, 304 (1991). "
953,11," As discussed below, Plaintiffs do not allege that Defendant Manufacturers' efforts to undermine or eliminate the tobacco 
program constitute separate violations of sections 1 and 2; rather, they are further circumstantial evidence of Defendants' 
collusion. It is Defendants' alleged bid rigging and supply allocation that constitute antitrust violations, and Defendant Buyers' 
involvement in those activities has been sufficiently alleged."
953,12," HN12[
] Allocation of markets in violation of antitrust laws typically involves an agreement not to compete for customers, not 
to sell in the same geographic area, or not to sell a similar product. See, e.g.,  United States v. Topco Assocs., Inc., 405 U.S. 
596, 597, 92 S. Ct. 1126, 1134, 31 L. Ed. 2d 515 (1972) (holding that the defendant's scheme of allocating territories to minimize 
competition at the retail level was a horizontal restraint constituting a per se violation of section 1 of the Sherman Act); United 
States v. Sealy, Inc., 388 U.S. 350, 357, 87 S. Ct. 1847, 1852-53, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1238 (1967) (holding that horizontal allocations of 
sales territories are unlawful under the Sherman Act); Hartford-Empire Co. v. United States, 323 U.S. 386, 401-02, 65 S. Ct. 
373, 382, 89 L. Ed. 322 (1945) (holding that allocation of fields of manufacturing violated the Sherman Act). Plaintiffs allege that Defendants violated the Sherman Act by allocating the supply of tobacco. Though such allocation is caused 
by purchasers rather than sellers, it causes the same harm to competition prohibited by the Sherman Act. The analysis 
undertaken by the Supreme Court with respect to bid rigging by buyers as opposed to sellers applies to Plaintiffs' allocation 
claims. While Defendant Manufacturers submitted their purchase intentions, thereby determining the amount of available 
tobacco, the legitimacy of the quota system is not dispositive of Plaintiffs' allocation claims. Though Defendant Manufacturers 
are subject to a penalty for buying less tobacco than they intended, they are free to buy more, which would increase competition. 
Thus, if Defendants allocated the tobacco supply as alleged, not only would they be restraining competition by dividing up the 
supply, but they would also provide an added safeguard to the participants of the conspiracy to lower prices, ensuring that each 
ended up with its desired quantity of tobacco. "
954,13," Companies are said to engage in ""conscious parallelism"" when they intentionally adopt the practices or policies of a 
competitor. See, e.g.,  Brooke Group, Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Co., 509 U.S. 209, 227, 113 S. Ct. 2578, 2590, 125 
L. Ed. 2d 168 (1993)."
954,14," The Fourth Circuit only considered the issue of whether the district court had abused its discretion in denying class certification 
and did not address the district court's denial of the defendants' motion to dismiss. "
956,15," Defendants argue that Woods Exploration & Producing Co. v. Aluminum Co. of America, 438 F.2d 1286, 1298 (5th Cir. 
1971) is not applicable because it was decided before California Motor Trans. Co. v. Trucking Unlimited, 404 U.S. 508, 512, 92 
S. Ct. 609, 612, 30 L. Ed. 2d 642 (1972), which they contend clearly held that the Noerr-Pennington immunity extended broadly 
to efforts to influence all branches of government. While immunity might extend to activities to influence more than policy-making 
branches, California Motor Transport held that deceit was not immunized when it corrupted administrative or judicial processes. 
Thus, the fact that Woods predates California Motor Transport has no bearing on its holding. "
957,16," Defendant Manufacturers could argue that their purchase intentions change policy to the extent that lowered submissions 
might result in a change to the tobacco program if growers decide not to avail themselves of its protections because the quota is 
too low. However, that would be twisting the administrative purpose of the quota formula into a political process. Unlawful 
attempts to hinder an administrative program do not become protected First Amendment activities aimed at policy changes when 
they lead to the elimination of the program. "
958,17," The court notes that Plaintiffs do not allege that the private contracts violate the Sherman Act. It will not address the issue of 
whether such contracts could be used to support Plaintiffs' conspiracy claims."
958,18," As discussed, the Supreme Court has held that HN21[
] section 2 is also violated by abuse of oligopoly, monopsony, or oligopsony power. "
959,19," As noted previously, Defendant Manufacturers' did not submit a renewed motion to dismiss the third amended complaint 
because Plaintiffs only added Defendant Buyers. "
964,1," According to the complaint, Latin American and Carribean travel agents must be licensed or accredited by IATA in order to 
make international reservations; without such registration, a Latin American/Caribbean agent cannot receive the identification 
number needed to enter the reservation system to make airline passenger reservations on any of the four defendant air carriers. 
(Complaint, P31). Moreover, reservations on American, Continental, Delta and United Airlines account for a substantial, if not the 
predominant, portion of the business done by travel agents in Latin America and the Caribbean. (Complaint, P32). The named 
plaintiffs here are four travel agencies located in San Jose, Costa Rica and Managua, Nicaragua; IATA is a trade association of 
airlines of which American, Continental, Delta and United are members."
964,2," The proposed class consists of ""all IATA-accredited travel agents in Latin America and the Caribbean, excluding any travel 
agencies owned in whole or in part by defendants to this litigation, or their affiliates or subsidiaries."" (Complaint, P18). "
995,1," The jury also determined that 3M had a trade secret in its slitting technology and experiment results including the design and 
setup of slitters, and in its winding methods used to compensate for variations in film calipher. However, the jury did not find that 
any of the defendants had improperly used or disclosed, or threatened to use or disclose either of these trade secrets. "
996,2," HN4[
] Because the purpose of trade secret law is to encourage innovation and development, protection should not extend 
beyond the limits needed to protect genuine trade secrets. See American Can Co. v. Mansukhani, 742 F.2d 314, 329 (7th Cir. 
1984). The umbrella of trade secret classification should not be deployed to suppress legitimate competition. Id. As such, the 
plaintiff must do more than direct the court to a broad area of technology and assert that something there must have been secret 
and misappropriated. The plaintiff must point to concrete secrets. See Composite Marine Propellers, Inc. v. Van Der Woude, 962 
F.2d 1263, 1266 (7th Cir. 1992). "
997,3," As for the plaintiff's trade secrets in slitting technology and winding methods, the district court permanently enjoined the 
defendants from making use of those secrets. "
1001,4," While not crucial to the disposition of this matter, we note that under Wisconsin law, the elements of a tortious interference with 
contract claim are: (1) the plaintiff had a contract or prospective contractual relationship with a third party, (2) the defendant 
interfered with that relationship, (3) the interference was intentional, (4) a causal connection exists between the interference and 
the damages, and (5) the defendant was not justified or privileged to interfere. See Dorr v. Sacred Heart Hosp., 228 Wis. 2d 425, 
597 N.W.2d 462, 478 (Wis. Ct. App. 1999). "
1004,5," 3M urges this Court that the jury's verdict should not be overturned on insufficiency of evidence grounds, given the fact that the 
district court determined that the defendants had engaged in spoliation of evidence. At the heart of 3M's claim lies the fact that 
the evening before Pribyl was to turn over his computer pursuant to a discovery request, six gigabytes of music was downloaded 
onto his hard drive. This enormous volume of data consisted of the same songs being recorded multiple times in a short time 
span. While defendants argued that the spoliation was conducted by Pribyl's children who use the computer, the district court 
instructed the jury that they could draw a negative inference from the act of destruction. 3M maintains that by overturning the jury 
verdict on the basis of lack of evidence, the court below negated its instruction and rewarded defendants for their spoliation. We 
find the downloading of six gigabytes of music files onto Pribyl's hard drive on the eve that it was to be turned over for 
examination troubling, and his proposed justifications difficult to accept. Discovery is a meaningful part of our adversarial system, 
and were parties to circumvent discovery requests by selectively destroying potentially damaging information, the process would 
become ineffectual. There is no doubt that the district court was correct in giving a negative inference instruction, and that it 
could have rightly imposed sanctions on Pribyl. However, the fact that hard drive space was destroyed on Pribyl's computer 
does not relieve 3M of having to prove the elements of its claims. 3M has not suggested how the evidence it believed it would 
have received from the computer would have impacted its misappropriation claim. Without at least some suggestion that the 
computer contained information which would have assisted 3M's claim, we cannot allow 3M to prevail on any claim for which 
there was insufficient evidence. Furthermore, we recognize that the district court was in a unique position to examine the impact 
that any spoliation may have had on 3M's claims. The court, while aware of the spoliation, was still comfortable in determining 
that there was insufficient evidence to support 3M's claim. Sitting as a court of review, we do not dispute that determination. "
1005,6," Originally, the district court had not enjoined Accu-Tech from using 3M's customized resin formulations. However, in light of the 
district court's decision on motion for judgment as a matter of law that the defendants had not misappropriated 3M's trade secret 
is customized resin formulations, the district court, as part of its April 3 order, added customized resin formulations to the list of 
trade secrets which Accu-Tech was forbidden to use (as well as disclose). Thus, the only 3M trade secret which Accu-Tech can 
use as a result of the district court's orders is the company's trade secret in the operating procedures and manuals. "
1006,7," Such a system would encourage parties to bypass the market and misappropriate trade secrets, knowing that if caught, the 
party would merely have to pay the amount it would have had to negotiate for in the first instance. Though we do not read the 
decision in Next Level Communications to establish such a regime, to the extent that the opinion can be interpreted to do so, we 
reject that logic. "
1007,8," We note in closing that, contrary to 3M's assertion, Accu-Tech, as a result of the district court's decision, has not simply bought 
the trade secret that it misappropriated. By its malfeasance, Accu-Tech was surely able to acquire 3M's trade secret with greater 
rapidity than it otherwise would have. But as a result, not only has Accu-Tech been forced to repay 3M the cost of development, 
but it has been permanently forbidden from acquiring complete ownership over those trade secrets. Within the bundle of rights 
commonly characterized as ownership of property also lies the right to transfer ownership. That stick in the bundle is no less 
essential than the right to exclude others. Yet, as a result of the district court's order, which Accu-Tech has not challenged on 
appeal, Accu-Tech is forbidden from disclosing 3M's trade secret to any third party, despite the court's finding that the company 
could have independently developed 3M's trade secret. Thus, far from leaving 3M with no protection against the future harm 
caused by Accu-Tech's misappropriation, the district court's decision has provided 3M with a blanket of protection that it would 
not have received otherwise. "
1019,*," In Jensen v. Anderson County Dep't of Soc. Servs., 304 S.C. 195, 403 S.E.2d 615 (S.C. 1991), the South Carolina court dealt 
with the narrow area of child welfare cases and an assumed public duty by officials involved in such cases.  Barker v. Sauls, 289 
S.C. 121, 345 S.E.2d 244 (S.C. 1986), permitted an employee to sue his employer's insurance broker regarding coverage that 
had a direct affect on the employee. Finally, appellant cites Terlinde v. Neely, 275 S.C. 395, 271 S.E.2d 768 (S.C. 1980), which 
dealt with the extension of warranties on a property. "
1026,1," The complaint also charged that Koch's rates discriminated against CF in favor of a Koch affiliate, a charge the STB found 
moot for most of the terminals and rejected on the merits for two. Final Order at 28. CF does not appeal the Board's disposition 
of the discrimination claim."
1026,2," See ICC Termination Act § 204(a), 109 Stat. at 941 (providing that all ICC orders and regulations shall continue in effect until 
modified or revoked by the STB), reprinted in 49 U.S.C. § 701 note. "
1027,3," ""Notwithstanding the title…, those guidelines are not limited to any one commodity. Coal cases, which typify captive, 
highvolume, repetitive rail traffic, were the springboard for our analysis because of the prevalence of coal rate challenges."" Rate 
Guidelines--Non-Coal Proceedings, Ex Parte No. 347 (Sub.-No. 2), 1995 WL 705171 (I.C.C. Dec. 1, 1995)."
1027,4," In parts of its opinion not challenged in this court, the STB found that Koch does not face effective: (1) ""intramodal"" competition 
from the MAPCO pipeline, because that pipeline originates in Texas and Oklahoma rather than Louisiana where complainants 
are located, Final Order at 8; (2) ""geographic"" competition from anhydrous ammonia produced at other locations, except at the 
one point at which the MAPCO and Koch pipelines cross and share a common storage terminal, id. at 17-19; (3) ""product"" 
competition, i.e., the ability of farmers to substitute other fertilizer products for anhydrous ammonia, id. at 20-21; or (4) 
""intermodal"" competition from trucks or railroads, id. at 8-11."
1027,5," The STB found that barge shipping does constrain Koch's prices to CF at one pipeline destination, which is located on the 
Missouri River at Palmyra, Missouri. Final Order at 12. CF does not appeal that finding. "
1028,6," According to CF's study, Koch could raise its rates an additional 20-50% without facing effective barge competition. Final Order 
at 11 (citing CF exhibits and verified statements)."
1028,7," There were four points at which Koch would not increase net revenue if all cost-competitive tonnage were diverted to barge. 
Final Order at 16. As to these points, however, the Board found that the tonnage that could actually be diverted, given capacity 
constraints at the storage terminals, was ""too small an amount … to constrain Koch's rates,"" and that Koch would ""still earn 
greater revenues on its retained traffic (with the rate increases) at each of these pipeline points than what it earned for all of the 
traffic at each of those points under the prior rates."" Id. at 17. "
1029,8," Koch points out that, in a footnote, the STB stated: ""While we do not rely on"" quantitative measures like the revenue 
comparison methodology ""as a substitute for a thorough qualitative examination of all possible competitive alternatives … , we 
are not restricted from using any valid tool … where, as here, the other evidence leaves the question [of effective competitive 
alternatives] unresolved."" Final Order at 15-16 n.43. But rather than read this footnote, as Koch does, as indicating that the 
Board's ultimate conclusion rested solely on the outcome of the revenue comparison, we read it, in accord with the text of the 
STB opinion, as confirming that the Board undertook a ""thorough qualitative examination of all possible competitive alternatives"" 
before reaching its conclusion."
1029,9," Koch correctly notes that the market dominance guidelines did reject the use of certain quantitative presumptions: e.g., high 
price/cost ratios, observed market share percentages, and substantial shipper-related investments.  365 I.C.C. at 120-26. None 
of those presumptions was employed in this case."
1029,10," Our opinion in Salt River is not to the contrary. Although we affirmed an ICC finding of lack of market dominance even though 
the alternatives ""may not [have] exerted effective market pressure"" on the defendant railroad's rates, we did so because the 
complainant shipper used the railroad ""only under exceptional and unpredictable circumstances."" 762 F.2d at 1064 & n.14. We 
concluded that in enacting the market dominance inquiry of 49 U.S.C. § 10707, Congress did not intend to include a situation in 
which a carrier had only ""transitory market power"" over a shipper. Id. at 1062. Here, CF is not merely an occasional user of 
Koch's pipeline, and the latter's exertion of market power cannot be characterized as ""transitory."" "
1030,11," See Aluminum Co., 761 F.2d at 751 (""It is not possible for petitioners in this proceeding to challenge the validity of [the ICC's 
market dominance guidelines]. The time for direct review of the Commission's guidelines has long passed."" (citing 28 U.S.C. § 
2344))."
1030,12," Although techniques exist for measuring market power more directly, they involve data not typically available to courts or 
regulators, and data which the parties agree are not part of the record in this case. See William M. Landes & Richard A. Posner, 
Market Power in Antitrust Cases, 94 HARV. L. REV. 937, 939-43 (1981) (noting that market power can be measured directly 
with knowledge of firm marginal cost or elasticity of demand)."
1030,13," In the closely related area of merger analysis, the Department of Justice defines the scope of the relevant product market by 
asking whether a hypothetical profit-maximizing firm that is the only seller of the product could profitably impose a ""small but 
significant and nontransitory increase in price."" See U.S. DEP'T OF JUSTICE, HORIZONTAL MERGER GUIDELINES § 1.11 
(1992); see also IIA AREEDA P 536, at 195-96 (noting that a product is a market of its own if a firm controlling all of its output 
could profit from a significant price increase). Koch cites antitrust cases that it regards as inconsistent with the proposition discussed in the text, but those cases are 
inapposite. Blue Cross holds that high prices or high profits alone do not necessarily evidence monopoly power, see Blue Cross 
& Blue Shield United of Wisc. v. Marshfield Clinic, 65 F.3d 1406, 1411-12 (7th Cir. 1995), but the STB used neither as an index 
of market dominance here. Brooke Group held that industry-wide price increases do not necessarily evidence conscious 
parallelism in an oligopolistic market, Brooke Group Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 509 U.S. 209, 237, 125 L. Ed. 
2d 168, 113 S. Ct. 2578 (1993), a point not at issue in this case."
1030,14," Although it is true that during 1988-95 Koch's prices were potentially subject to rate regulation by the ICC, the Commission 
never imposed regulation and Koch never tried to raise its rates. Koch asserts that its pre-increase rates were substantially 
below those of ""its competitor pipeline [MAPCO] and barge competitors."" Koch Br. at 16-17. But the Board rejected that 
contention because ""such comparisons, especially to carriers that largely serve different markets or bear different transportation 
characteristics and operating costs, are not particularly instructive."" Final Order at 16 n.43. Indeed, Koch's contention assumes 
the answer to the question at issue: Are the MAPCO pipeline and barge carriers really Koch's competitors? The Board found, "
1031,," and Koch has not challenged here, that the MAPCO pipeline is not an intramodal competitor because it does not serve 
complainants' Louisiana production facilities, and that it does not pose geographic competition except at one terminal. As for the 
barges, the STB concluded that the fact that their rates were substantially above those of Koch showed not that Koch's rates 
were sub-market, but rather that barge transport is an ineffective competitive alternative to pipeline. As explained in Part II.B 
infra, we find that conclusion to be a reasonable one."
1031,15," See Arizona Pub. Serv. Co., 742 F.2d at 650-51 (holding that in light of significant cost difference, fact that complainant 
received oil by both trucks and railroad did not make trucks an effective competitive alternative); Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe 
Ry. v. ICC, 188 U.S. App. D.C. 360, 580 F.2d 623, 636 (D.C. Cir. 1978) (""Shippers must be able to make the choice to use an 
alternative service without absorbing substantial economic loss.""); see also Salt River, 762 F.2d at 1059 (noting that market 
dominance guidelines require findings on the relative costs of potential alternatives, and that without evidence of relative costs, 
the ""mere possibility"" that shipper ""could"" use alternative carrier does not render alternative an effective competitor); IIA 
AREEDA P 534b, at 180 (noting that ""substantial differences in production, transportation, or other costs among … products 
prevent one from operating as an effective competitive check on the prices of the other""). "
1032,16," The other two are market efficiency and phasing.  1 I.C.C. 2d at 521; see Consolidated Rail, 812 F.2d at 1450-51. "
1033,17," HN10[
] The governing statute directs that, when prescribing a rate, ""the Board shall consider, among other factors-- (1) the effect of the prescribed rate … on the movement of traffic by that carrier; (2) the need for revenues that are sufficient … to let the carrier provide that transportation or service; and (3) the availability of other economic transportation alternatives."
1033,49," U.S.C. § 15503(b). It also states that ""in prescribing [a] rate … the Board may utilize rate reasonableness procedures that 
provide an effective simulation of a market-based price for a stand alone pipeline."" Id. § 15503(a) (emphasis added)."
1033,18," The Board's position is not inconsistent with our decisions in Burlington and PEPCO. In Burlington, we remanded a ratemaking 
because the ICC had returned to a pre-CMP standard without explanation. See Burlington N. R.R. v. ICC, 300 U.S. App. D.C. 1, 
985 F.2d 589, 599 (D.C. Cir. 1993). In PEPCO, we upheld the ICC's use of SAC in determining the reasonableness of the rates 
of a railroad with inadequate revenues, but noted that where the other CMP constraints are applicable (they were not applicable 
in PEPCO), ""stand-alone cost is not the only ceiling on rates."" Potomac Electric Power Co. v. ICC, 240 U.S. App. D.C. 170, 744 
F.2d 185, 193-94 (D.C. Cir. 1984)."
1033,19," See also Railroad Revenue Adequacy--1988 Determination, 6 I.C.C. 2d 933, 935 n.3 (1990) (stating that ""original"" or 
""predecessor"" cost ""represents the cost of the asset when it was first dedicated to public service, plus any subsequent 
improvements, less depreciation and retirements""). "
1034,20," The instructions define the entry for ""carrier property"" as ""the cost of property owned that is devoted to transportation service,"" 
and define cost as ""the amount of money actually paid for property or services."" See 18 C.F.R. Pt. 352, def. 11, instr. 2-3. The 
instructions further state that, ""in accounting for a 'purchase,' "" i.e. an acquisition of a ""distinct operating system"" involving a price 
over $ 250,000, ""the assets shall be recorded on the books of the acquiring carrier at cost as of the date of acquisition."" Id., instr. 
3-11 (emphasis added)."
1034,21," Indeed, the same order advised Koch that CF anticipated that revenue adequacy would be ""an important and relevant 
reasonableness cap in this case,"" Initial Order at 6, and as we discuss in the next section, the revenue adequacy constraint uses 
acquisition cost as the measure of a carrier's pipeline investment. "
1035,22," Koch quotes the Board's decision in CSX Corp. for the proposition that ""carriers cannot attract and retain capital unless they 
are given the opportunity to be compensated for the real value of the property, not just the book value."" Koch Br. at 30 (quoting 
CSX Corp., 1998 STB LEXIS 1559, No. 33388, 1998 WL 456510 at *40 (S.T.B. July 23, 1998)). But the ""book value"" rejected by 
the STB in CSX was the ""predecessor book value,"" 1998 STB LEXIS 1559, 1998 WL 456510 at *40, not the railroad's own 
acquisition cost--which, in fact, the Board ultimately relied upon in that case. 1998 STB LEXIS 1559, [WL] at *38."
1035,23," Our decision in City of Los Angeles v. United States Dep't of Transp., 322 U.S. App. D.C. 321, 103 F.3d 1027, 1032-33 (D.C. 
Cir. 1997), is not to the contrary. In that case, we vacated a DOT decision to set fees in reliance on original cost rather than fair 
market value, because the Department mistakenly thought it was statutorily required to use original cost. The STB had no such 
misconception in this case."
1035,24," Koch contends that the Board's Railroad Revenue Adequacy standards were intended to apply only to the annual revenue 
adequacy calculations the STB performs for railroads, and not to ""the ratemaking context."" Koch Br. at 32 n.7. But the Board's 
interpretation to the contrary is a reasonable reading of the regulations. See Coal Rate Guidelines, 1 I.C.C. 2d at 535 (using 
Railroad Revenue Adequacy standards to define the revenue adequacy constraint of the CMP methodology). Nor, as the STB 
explained, does Arkansas & Missouri Railroad, 6 I.C.C. 2d 619, 627 (1990), aff'd sub nom.  Missouri Pac. R.R. v. ICC, 306 U.S. 
App. D.C. 223, 23 F.3d 531 (D.C. Cir. 1994), compel the use of replacement cost in revenue adequacy determinations. Final 
Order at 25 n.64. In that case, the ICC used replacement cost because ""an arm's length purchase price"" cost could not be 
determined as a consequence of the way in which the purchase agreement had been structured.  6 I.C.C. 2d at 626; see 23 
F.3d at 534. "
1036,25," The Board also denied permission to amend on the ground that CF was estopped from challenging the rates in effect prior to 
1996 by a settlement agreement with Koch's predecessor. In light of our affirmance of the Board's determination with respect to 
untimeliness, we do not address the STB's alternative rationale."
1036,26," Farmland suggests that its petition to intervene should be treated differently, but that petition likewise sought to bar Koch from 
""charging any increase in rates established on or about April 1, 1996,"" Pet. P 34, and sought as damages the difference 
between a reasonable rate ""and the rate paid by Farmland … during the period beginning on April 1, 1996,"" Id. P 29. Moreover, 
in granting Farmland's petition, the Board relied on the fact that ""Koch did not oppose Farmland's intervention because the 
subject matter of Farmland's complaint is substantially similar to that of the complaint brought by CF."" CF Indus., Inc., No. 
41685, slip. op. at 1 (S.T.B. July 25, 1996). "
1047,1," The old Ninth Circuit rule prior to the Supreme Court's decision in Caterpillar, Inc. was that there was no field preemption 
absent the existence of a federal remedy. See Sullivan, 813 F.2d at 1372. The Supreme Court rejected this rule in Caterpillar, 
Inc. See 482 U.S. at 391 n.4. The Circuit subsequently distinguished Caterpillar by explaining that field preemption still requires 
the existence of a federal cause of action, even if a remedy available in state court is not available under federal law. See  Hyles 
v. Mensing, 849 F.2d 1213, 1215 (9th Cir. 1988) (""Even if the plaintiff's complaint does not refer to federal law, the case may be 
removed if federal law preempts completely the state law on which it relies and 'supplants' the state claim with a federal claim. 
Federal law need not afford the same remedies as state law to support removal.""), citing Caterpillar, 482 U.S. at 391 n.4. "
1048,2," 16 U.S.C. § 825p grants federal courts exclusive jurisdiction over ""all suits in equity and actions at law brought to enforce any 
liability or duty created by, or to enjoin any violation of, this chapter or any rule, regulation, or order thereunder."""
1048,3," Plaintiffs also suggest that the Court should apply the test developed by the Fifth Circuit in Aaron v. National Union Fire Ins. 
Co., 876 F.2d 1157 (5th Cir. 1989) to determine whether a federal statute completely preempts state causes of action. Under 
that test, there is complete preemption if a defendant demonstrates: (1) the existence of a cause of action within the disputed 
federal statute; (2) a jurisdictional provision for the cause of action that ""closely parallels"" the jurisdictional provisions of the 
LMRA and ERISA; and (3) evidence of the kind of congressional intent found to exist in ERISA.  Aaron, 876 F.2d at 1164-65. 
The first element is satisfied since the Federal Power Act does not provide a private right of action. See  Montana-Dakota, 341 
U.S. 246, 251, 95 L. Ed. 912, 71 S. Ct. 692. The Ninth Circuit included similar language in a recent removal case. See  Blab T.V. 
of Mobile, Inc. v. Comcast Cable Communications, Inc., 182 F.3d 851, 856 (9th Cir. 1999) (""These cases reveal that, although 
the Supreme Court recognizes the existence of the complete preemption doctrine, the Court does so hesitatingly and displays 
no enthusiasm to extend the doctrine into areas of law beyond the LMRA and ERISA. A narrow reading of Metropolitan Life 
suggests that complete preemption occurs only when a federal cause of action features jurisdictional language that closely 
parallels that of section 301 of the LMRA as well as an express statement within the legislative history that Congress intends for 
all related claims to arise under federal law in the same manner as section 301. Courts, however, have not uniformly interpreted 
Metropolitan Life in this fashion and have struggled to define the exact contours of the complete preemption doctrine."") The 
Court need not determine whether the Fifth Circuit test would also govern in the Ninth Circuit since the Court concludes that 
complete preemption is made impossible by the absence of a federal cause of action supplanting Plaintiffs' state claims."
1048,4," Defendants argue that Plaintiffs' actions actually are challenges to the rates charged as not ""just and reasonable"" under 16 
U.S.C. § 824d. The propriety of this characterization is discussed more fully below. Assuming for purposes of the instant 
argument that Defendants are correct, however, the Court concludes that there is no complete preemption since the Federal 
Power Act does not provide Plaintiffs with a private cause of action to make this challenge. "
1049,5," The Court also notes that in Engle v. West Penn Power Co., 366 Pa. Super. 104, 530 A.2d 913 (1987), a Pennsylvania 
Superior Court held that the Federal Power Act did not completely preempt plaintiffs' common law tort claims against an electric 
utility for damage cause by an accidental water release from the utility's dam. In reaching this decision, the Engle court relied on 
the Supreme Court's decision in Pan American Petroleum Corp. v. Superior Court, 366 U.S. 656, 6 L. Ed. 2d 584, 81 S. Ct. 1303 
(1961), in which the Supreme Court held that the federal Natural Gas Act did not completely preempt state contract claims. The 
court in Engle noted that the legislative history of the Natural Gas Act indicated that it was patterned after the Federal Power Act. 
530 A.2d at 917. Noting the congruity between the jurisdictional provisions of the two Acts, and noting that the Supreme Court in 
Pan American held that the Natural Gas Act did not completely preempt, the Engle court concluded that ""because it is well-
established that the Natural Gas Act does not create a cause of action that completely preempts state contract actions, we see 
no reason either in law or logic advising against the use of case law interpreting the same to give us insight into the breadth 
Congress intended to imbue in the 'exclusivity' clause of § 825 of the Federal Power Act."" 530 A.2d at 918. "
1050,6," If Plaintiffs are challenging the rates as not ""just and reasonable"" under 16 U.S.C. § 824d, then they are raising a substantial 
federal question that can only be resolved by looking to the Federal Power Act. Such a challenge would also bring Plaintiffs 
within the Federal Power Act's exclusive jurisdiction provision since the challenge would be an action to enforce a ""liability or 
duty created by"" the Federal Power Act. See 16 U.S.C. § 825d. "
1051,7," The fact that some Plaintiffs might have used the phrase ""just and reasonable"" or ""unjust and unreasonable"" in their complaint 
does not change the Court's analysis because there is no indication that Plaintiffs intended to use these claims as they are used 
in 16 U.S.C. § 824d to plead a federal claim (and thereby invoke federal jurisdiction) on the face of their complaints. ""HN20[
] 
The mere reference of a federal statute in a pleading will not convert a state law claim into a federal cause of action if the federal 
statute is not a necessary element of the state law claim and no preemption exists."" Easton v. Crossland Mortg. Corp., 114 F.3d 
979, 982 (9th Cir. 1997), citing  Rains v. Criterion Sys., Inc., 80 F.3d 339, 345-47 (9th Cir. 1996). "
1052,8," HN23[
] Section 17200 provides: As used in this chapter, unfair competition shall mean and include any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or practice 
and unfair, deceptive, untrue or misleading advertising and any act prohibited by Chapter 1 (commencing with Section 
17500) of Part 3 of Division 7 of the Business and Professions Code. "
1071,1," Dioguardi also argues that he cannot be liable on Count Three because he did not serve as ONEOK's counsel until February 
25, 1999, four days after Southern Union and Southwest executed the Standstill Agreement (""Agreement"") that was allegedly 
the result of fraudulent inducement. Dioguardi also contends that Southern Union has not alleged any act by Dioguardi which 
could have fraudulently induced Southern Union to contract with Southwest. Dioguardi further avers that Southern Union has 
failed to plead fraud with particularity. "
1072,2," The parties have not cited any Oklahoma, Nevada, or Arizona cases on this subject. "
1073,3," The Court finds that the HN2[
] fraudulent inducement is ""complete"" upon the execution of a contract, but the limitations 
period does not necessarily begin to run at that time. See  In re Estate of Blake, 282 A.D.2d 905, 723 N.Y.S.2d 563, 564 
(N.Y.A.D. 2001) (cause of action accrued, and the limitations period began to run, when the contract was executed); Coffee v. 
General Motors Acceptance Corp., 30 F. Supp. 2d 1376, 1380 (S.D. Ga. 1998) (same); Burton v. Terrell, 368 F. Supp. 553, 557 
(W.D. Va. 1973) (same); but see A.R.S. § 12-543(3) (adopting discovery rule for fraud claims); Ca. Civ. Pro. § 338(d) (same)."
1073,4," Count Three is asserted against ""all Defendants,"" namely: Southwest, ONEOK, Maffie, Hartley, Zub, Dubay, Irvin, Rose, 
Gaberino, and Dioguardi."
1073,5," Irvin, Dubay, and Gaberino joined in ONEOK's Motion."
1073,6," It is not necessary to resolve the choice of law issue for the purpose of determining whether Southern Union has pled fraud 
with the degree of particularity required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b), because the law of the Ninth and Tenth Circuits is the same with 
respect to this issue. "
1075,7," Rose and Irvin both argue that Arizona's civil conspiracy law should apply. ONEOK argues that California's civil conspiracy law 
applies to Count Three, but Arizona's civil conspiracy law applies to Counts Seven and Eight. However, ONEOK states in its 
Supplemental Response Brief that Arizona law on civil conspiracy is consistent with California law on civil conspiracy."
1075,8," There is also no separate cause of action for conspiracy in Arizona. See  Rowland v. Union Hills Country Club, 157 Ariz. 301, 
306, 757 P.2d 105, 110 (App. 1988). In Nevada and Oklahoma, however, ""civil conspiracy"" appears to exist as a separate cause 
of action. See  Siragusa v. Brown, 114 Nev. 1384, 971 P.2d 801, 807 (Nev. 1998); Roberson v. PaineWebber, Inc., 2000 OK 
CIV APP 17, 998 P.2d 193, 201 (Okla. App. 1999) (addressing ""claim for civil conspiracy,"" but noting that civil conspiracy alone 
does not give rise to liability without an unlawful act)."
1075,9," HN8[
] In Arizona, a civil conspiracy occurs when ""two or more persons . . . agree to accomplish an unlawful purpose or to 
accomplish a lawful object by unlawful means, causing damages."" Rowland, 157 Ariz. at 306, 757 P.2d at 110. Similarly, a civil 
conspiracy in Oklahoma ""consists of a combination of two or more persons to do an unlawful act, or to do an unlawful act by 
lawful means."" Roberson, 998 P.2d at 201. The elements of civil conspiracy in Nevada are nearly identical to those required by 
Arizona and Oklahoma. See  Sutherland v. Gross, 105 Nev. 192, 772 P.2d 1287, 1290 (Nev. 1989) (""An actionable conspiracy 
consists of a combination of two or more persons who, by some concerted action, intend to accomplish an unlawful objective for 
the purpose of harming another, and damage results from the act or acts.""). "
1076,10," Southern Union relies upon De Vries v. Brumback, 53 Cal. 2d 643, 349 P.2d 532, 2 Cal. Rptr. 764 (1960), for the proposition 
that actions taken after the Agreement was signed can constitute conspiratorial acts. The Court finds that the decision in DeVries 
is distinguishable, because that case involved a ""continuing conspiracy to convert"" in which parties joined the conspiracy after 
the commission of the robbery but before the property was sold, and conversion ""is a continuing tort as long as the person 
entitled to the use and possession of his property is deprived thereof."" 2 Cal. Rptr. at 767. As previously stated in this Order, the 
alleged fraudulent inducement was complete the moment Southern Union entered into the Agreement."
1076,11," The Court has read the SAC in its entirety. The Court has also given due consideration to those paragraphs in the SAC which 
Southern Union believes lend the most support to its fraudulent inducement claim. (See Southern Union's Supplemental Brief, 
Exh. A; see also Southern Union's Response to Motions to Dismiss at 56). The Court has also reviewed every other paragraph 
in the SAC to ascertain whether the allegations are sufficient to establish a nexus between the Defendants named in Count 
Three (other than Southwest or Maffie) and the conspiracy."
1076,12, The SAC does not state the time period during which Zub held this position. 
1077,13," The SAC does not state whether a position as a ""senior officer"" with the merged entity would be a promotion, demotion, or 
equivalent position for Zub."
1077,14," Although in May, 1998, Southern Union (through Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette) allegedly expressed to Maffie an interest in 
exploring a merger with Southwest, Southern Union does not allege that anybody apart from Maffie knew about this interest. 
(SAC at P 25). Southern Union alleges that Maffie ignored Southern Union's interest in a merger. (Id. at P 27). Southern Union 
does not allege that Maffie told anyone about Southern Union's expressed interest. In fact, Southern Union alleges that Maffie 
did not disclose this information to Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc., Southwest's investment advisor, when Maffie sought advice in 
connection with a prospective ONEOK merger, nor did Maffie disclose this information to the Southwest Board of Directors 
(""Southwest Board"") or Southwest Management before a merger agreement was entered into with ONEOK. (Id. at PP 27, 29, 
34). "
1079,15," Still outstanding is Dubay's Motion to Dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, which the Second R&R recommends be denied 
because this issue was previously resolved by the Court on September 8, 2000, and Dubay was ordered not to renew this 
argument. The Court will adopt this aspect of the Second R&R."
1079,16," HN12[
] Although allegations based upon information and belief may satisfy Rule 9(b) if they allege matters ""peculiarly within the opposing party's knowledge[,]"" the allegations must be ""accompanied by a statement of the facts upon which the belief is 
founded."" Wool, 818 F.2d at 1439. The Court finds that the allegations contained in the SAC support Southern Union's 
information and belief with respect to this allegation."
1079,17," This allegation does not satisfy Rule 9(b). See  Wool, 818 F.2d at 1439. Southern Union has not alleged sufficient facts from 
which the Court may infer that the purpose of Rose's trip was iniquitous. See id. "
1080,18," Southern Union fails to proffer specific facts which would support a reasonable inference that Irvin also knew that Southern 
Union had been (allegedly) fraudulently induced to enter into the Agreement. See Wool, 818 F.2d at 1439."
1080,19," For these same reasons, the SAC fails to allege a claim of fraudulent inducement against Dioguardi. Although Rose allegedly 
suggested during the week of February 16, 1999, that ONEOK retain Dioguardi, Gaberino is not alleged to have called Dioguardi 
until February 25, 1999, four days after Southern Union signed the Agreement. (SAC at PP 56, 87). Furthermore, the SAC 
alleges, upon information and belief, that ""Dioguardi was retained for the express purpose of assisting ONEOK and the 
defendants in editing and presenting the March 8 letter to the Southwest Board."" (Id. at P 99). There are no allegations that 
Dioguardi agreed, implicitly or tacitly, that Southern Union should be fraudulently induced to sign the Agreement, or that he knew "
1081,," about a plan to fraudulently induce Southern Union. See Alfus, 745 F. Supp. at 1521; In re Sunset Bay Associates, 944 F.2d at 
1517; Roberts, 670 F. Supp. at 1484; Kidron, 47 Cal. Rptr. 2d at 758; See In re Sunrise Technologies Sec. Litig., 1992 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 18213, No. C-92-0948TEH, 1992 WL 359636 at *7."
1081,20," Because Count Three is a compulsory counterclaim in the Nevada action, it is not a compulsory counterclaim in the Oklahoma 
action (CV-00-1812-PHX-ROS). See Fed. R. Civ. P. 13(a)(1). "
1082,21," The Agreement contains the following forum selection provision: ""The Agreement shall be governed and construed in 
accordance with the laws of the State of California applicable to contracts made, executed, delivered and performed wholly 
within the State of California without regard to the conflict of laws principles thereof."" (ONEOK's Motion to Dismiss, Exh. B). "
1083,22," ONEOK, which is no longer a Defendant in Count Three, also submits that § 187(2) is the applicable provision."
1083,23," Southern Union has made the assumption that Arizona's choice of law rules rather than the rules of Nevada will be applied. 
Nevertheless, the Court will consider the similarity between California and Nevada law on fraudulent inducement when 
determining whether there are public policy concerns with the application of California law."
1083,24," Maffie argues that the place of incorporation alone does not satisfy the ""substantial relationship"" test. However, Maffie 
subsequently asserts that for purposes of § 145 of the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws, a court may appropriately 
consider the place of incorporation when determining which state has the ""most significant relationship to the occurrence and the 
parties."" (Maffie's Supplemental Response Brief at 5). "
1084,25," However, in that diversity action, the Manetti-Farrow court did not address the applicability of the Restatement (Second) of 
Conflict of Laws."
1084,26," This argument was originally raised by ONEOK in its Motion to Dismiss, but it was subsequently raised by Southwest. "
1086,27," At the hearing on the Motions before the Special Master, counsel for ONEOK conceded that one purpose of the Agreement 
was to evaluate Southern Union's offer. (Reporter's Transcript of 1/12/01 at 42)."
1086,28," In its Objections to the Second R&R, Southwest cites several cases with respect to this issue: Foley v. Interactive Data Corp., 
47 Cal. 3d 654, 254 Cal. Rptr. 211, 765 P.2d 373 (1988); Reid v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 173 Cal. App. 3d 557, 218 Cal. 
Rptr. 913 (1985); Racine & Laramie, Ltd., Inc. v. Dept. of Parks and Rec., 11 Cal. App. 4th 1026, 14 Cal. Rptr. 2d 335 (1992). 
None of these cases negate a determination that the covenant of good faith and fair dealing applies to all contracts. See  Foley, 
254 Cal. Rptr. at 227 (holding that the covenant generally cannot form the basis of an independent tort claim); see  Reid, 218 
Cal. Rptr. at 920 (court can determine whether the covenant was breached as a matter of law); Racine & Laramie, Ltd., Inc., 14 
Cal. Rptr. 2d at 340 (there is no breach of the covenant where a party to a contract declines to renew the contract)."
1086,29," The Court does not hereby render any determination regarding whether the duty to conduct a good faith evaluation required 
Southwest to accept Southern Union's merger offer after conducting such an evaluation. See  Vestar Development II, LLC v. 
General Dynamics Corp., 249 F.3d 958, 962 (9th Cir. 2001) (holding that damages were too speculative where there was a 
breach of an agreement to negotiate); see also  Crane Co. v. Coltec Industries, Inc., 171 F.3d 733, 736 (2d Cir. 1999) (a 
confidentiality agreement did not constitute an agreement to merge or a commitment to reach such an agreement). However, the 
fact that regulatory approval was required before a merger could occur does not nullify the tortious interference claims. See  
SCEcorp v. Superior Court of San Diego County, 3 Cal. App. 4th 673, 4 Cal. Rptr. 2d 372, 375 (App. 1992)."
1086,30," Counts Seven and Eight are asserted against ""all Defendants except Southwest, Hartley, and Zub,"" namely: ONEOK, Maffie, 
Dubay, Irvin, Rose, Gaberino, and Dioguardi. "
1088,31, Zub is not named as a Defendant in Count Seven.
1088,32, ONEOK asserts this same argument with respect to Count Eight. 
1090,33," Southern Union submits, without any legal argument, that the Oklahoma court erred in rendering that decision. It is not clear 
whether Southern Union ever sought reconsideration of the Oklahoma court's ruling."
1090,34," This determination does not extend to Count Seven. ONEOK's status as a third party beneficiary shields it from liability only 
with respect to a claim of tortious interference with a contractual relationship, not to a claim of tortious interference with a 
business relationship, because the business relationship allegedly interfered with extends far beyond the Agreement. "
1091,35," Dioguardi also argues that Arizona law applies to these claims. Only Maffie, who is no longer a Defendant with respect to 
these claims, argues that Nevada law should apply. "
1092,36," HN47[
] The elements of a claim of tortious interference with contract are virtually identical to those of tortious interference 
with a business relationship, but they are separate claims. See  Bruce Church, Inc. v. United Farm Workers of America, AFL-
CIO, 169 Ariz. 22, 34, 816 P.2d 919, 931 (App. 1991). "
1093,37," Rose did not make Noerr-Pennington arguments of his own, but rather, joined in Dioguardi's Motion to Dismiss the tortious 
interference claims based on the Noerr-Pennington doctrine."
1093,38," In his Objections to the Second R&R, Rose appears to concede that Southern Union's allegations, if true, support a 
determination that Rose's conduct falls within the ""sham exception."" "
1095,39," Irvin, who is not a party to the Agreement, also contends that California law governs these three claims."
1095,40," The only tort claims asserted against Southern Union in the second Arizona action are Counts Eight and Nine. Count Eight 
alleges intentional interference with contract, and Count Nine alleges misappropriation of trade secrets. Other claims against 
Southern Union in the second Arizona action are for breach of contract (Count Six), breach of the covenant of good faith and fair 
dealing (Count Seven), and declaratory relief regarding the rights and liabilities of the parties on the contract (Count Ten). 
Southwest asserts that Count Seven is a contract claim. The second Arizona action contains claims against both Southern 
Union and ONEOK."
1095,41," Count Three in the Nevada action, and Count Nine in the second Arizona action, allege misappropriation of trade secrets."
1095,42," Count Four in the Nevada action, and Count Eight in the second Arizona action, allege that Southern Union intentionally 
interfered with the merger agreement between ONEOK and Southwest."
1095,43," Count Five in the Nevada action alleges that Southern Union intentionally interfered with Southwest's prospective economic 
advantage."
1095,44," Rather, in the context of Southern Union's own tortious interference claims, it asserts that ""neither Southwest nor Maffie has 
identified any conflict in the laws of Arizona and Nevada with respect to the tortious interference claims."" (Southern Union's 
Supplemental Response Brief at 7)."
1095,45," This same question is raised with respect to the contract claims asserted by Southwest against Southern Union in the second 
Arizona action, but it is not as critical because Southwest and Southern Union agree that the choice of law provision in the 
Agreement should be given effect. "
1097,46," ONEOK has asserted identical counterclaims, as well as a counterclaim for declaratory judgment, in the second Arizona 
action."
1097,47," As with certain of the claims between Southern Union and Southwest, there appears to be some duplicity with respect to the 
claims asserted in the second Oklahoma and second Arizona action between Southwest and ONEOK. "
1098,48," Southwest initially contends that the forum selection clause should apply to its contractual claim for breach of the implied 
covenant of good faith and fair dealing. (Southwest's Supplemental Brief at 14). However, it then argues, without citation to legal 
authority, that Arizona law should apply to that claim because it is a tort claim. (Id. at 15). Because Southwest has not identified 
any differences between the law of Arizona and Oklahoma with respect to such claims, the Court will apply Oklahoma law. As 
Southwest points out, the remedy for a breach of this covenant ""is ordinarily by action on the contract[.]"" Burkons v. Ticor Title 
Ins. Co. of California, 168 Ariz. 345, 355, 813 P.2d 710, 720 (1991). "

] A generic version of a pioneer drug (often described as a brandname drug) contains the same active ingredients, but 
not necessarily the same inactive ingredients, as the pioneer drug. A generic drug, as the name implies, is ordinarily sold without 
a brand name and at a lower price. See United States v. Generix Drug Corp., 460 U.S. 453, 454-55, 75 L. Ed. 2d 198, 103 S. Ct. 
1298 (1983)."
1117,2," Before the Amendments, an earlier version of the ANDA procedure was available to a generic drug manufacturer of a pioneer 
drug approved before 1962. A generic version of a pioneer drug approved after 1962, however, could be approved only through 
a full NDA. See Fox & Bennett, supra, at 95."

effective immediately unless an action is brought for infringement of a patent which is the subject of the certification before 
the expiration of forty-five days from the date the notice provided under paragraph (2)(B)(i) is received. If such an action is 
brought before the expiration of such days, the approval shall be made effective upon the expiration of the thirty-month 
period beginning on the date of the receipt of the notice provided under paragraph (2)(B)(i) or such shorter or longer period 
as the court may order because either party to the action failed to reasonably cooperate in expediting the action, except 
that-- "
1118,," (I) if before the expiration of such period the court decides that such patent is invalid or not infringed, the approval shall be 
made effective on the date of the court decision, (II) if before the expiration of such period the court decides that such patent has been infringed, the approval shall be made 
effective on such date as the court orders under section 271(e)(4)(A) of Title 35, or (III) if before the expiration of such period the court grants a preliminary injunction prohibiting the applicant from engaging in 
the commercial manufacture or sale of the drug until the court decides the issues of patent validity and infringement and if 
the court decides that such patent is invalid or not infringed, the approval shall be made effective on the date of such court 
decision. In such an action, each of the parties shall reasonably cooperate in expediting the action. Until the expiration of forty-five days 
from the date the notice made under paragraph (2)(B)(i) is received, no action may be brought under section 2201 of Title 28, for 
a declaratory judgment with respect to the patent. Any action brought under section 2201 shall be brought in the judicial district 
where the defendant has its principal place of business or a regular and established place of business."
1118,4," Later in 1996 Faulding Inc. filed an ANDA with a Paragraph IV certification for its generic version of Cardizem CD. In January 
1997 HMRI also filed suit against Faulding for patent infringement."
1118,5," The FDA issued tentative, as opposed to final, approval due to the pending infringement suit and the resulting 30-month 
statutory waiting period. "
1119,6," On July 14, 1998 the FDA published a notice entitled ""Guidance for Industry on 180-Day Generic Drug Exclusivity Under the 
Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; Availability,"" interpreting the Hatch-Waxman 
Amendments so as to give Andrx the relief it sought in its complaint. The Guidance explained that the FDA intended to delete 
the ""successful defense"" provisions from § 314.107(c)(1) and that the FDA would not enforce the ""successful defense"" 
provisions in the interim. See 63 Fed. Reg. 37,890 (July 14, 1998); see also JA 62 (Federal Defendant's Motion to Dismiss); JA 
198 (Notice of Dismissal). Accordingly, the district court subsequently dismissed the complaint. See JA 199. Andrx had earlier 
moved to dismiss Biovail's counterclaim for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted because, inter alia, Biovail 
lacked standing to assert an antitrust violation."
1119,7," In a letter dated October 22, 1999 the FDA explained to Biovail that it had ""completed review"" of its ANDA and found its generic 
""safe and effective."" JA 322. It gave tentative, rather than final, approval because of ""the exclusivity granted by the agency to 
Andrx."" JA 323; see also JA 327. "
1120,8," HN10[
] Section 1 of the Sherman Act prohibits contracts, combinations or conspiracies ""in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations."" 15 U.S.C. § 1. Section 2 states that ""every person who shall monopolize, or 
attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or 
commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a felony."" 15 U.S.C. § 2. In its 
counterclaim, Biovail alleged that Andrx violated both sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. JA 20-21."
1120,9," HN14[
] Section 4 of the Clayton Act authorizes a private suit only for injury to ""business or property."" 15 U.S.C. § 15; see 2 Areeda et al., supra, P 336, at 303. At the very least, ""business or property"" includes ""commercial interests or enterprises."" 
Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co., 405 U.S. 251, 264, 31 L. Ed. 2d 184, 92 S. Ct. 885 (1972). In Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., the Supreme 
Court noted that ""the word 'property' has a naturally broad and inclusive meaning."" Id. at 338. On appeal, the parties do not raise 
the issue of whether Biovail sufficiently alleged an injury to ""business or property."" "
1121,10," By the time of the district court's decision, however, the FDA had approved Biovail's ANDA for its generic version of Cardizem 
CD although the court was not apprised of that development."
1121,11," The issues of injury-in-fact and causation are closely linked on this point. By not alleging facts indicating its intent and 
preparedness to enter the Cardizem CD market, Biovail failed to allege both an injury (no loss of profits because not prepared to 
enter market) and causation (any damages not related to HMRI-Andrx Agreement because Agreement did not cause loss of 
profits). "
1123,12," HN21[
] Section 355(j)(5)(B)(iv) provides: If the application contains a certification described in subclause (IV) of paragraph (2)(A)(vii) and is for a drug for which a 
previous application has been submitted under this subsection continuing such a certification, the application shall be made 
effective not earlier than one hundred and eighty days after-- (I) the date the Secretary receives notice from the applicant under the previous application of the first commercial marketing 
of the drug under the previous application, or (II) the date of a decision of a court in an action described in clause (iii) holding the patent which is the subject of the 
certification to be invalid or not infringed, whichever is earlier."
1123,13," The court stated in a footnote: An amicus brief filed by Biovail Corporation International dramatically illustrates an analogous risk, not necessarily involving 
collusion. Biovail was the second applicant to file a paragraph IV ANDA for a generic version of a heart medication. Biovail 
was not sued by the pioneer drug company.  The first applicant and the pioneer drug company are now in litigation, and, 
Biovail claims, the pioneer is paying the first applicant some $ 10 million per quarter in exchange for the first applicant's 
agreement not to sell its product after the 30-month waiting period expires. Under these circumstances, neither party would 
seem to have maximum incentive to bring the litigation to a close."
1123,140, F.3d at 1072 n.14. 
1125,14," HN23[
] In a suit for equitable relief under section 16 of the Clayton Act, the plaintiff must also establish an antitrust injury, although the injury need only be threatened. See Zenith Radio, 395 U.S. 100, 130, 23 L. Ed. 2d 129, 89 S. Ct. 1562 (section 16 
""invokes traditional principles of equity and authorizes injunctive relief upon the demonstration of 'threatened' injury""); see also 
Cargill, Inc. v. Monfort of Colo., Inc., 479 U.S. 104, 122, 93 L. Ed. 2d 427, 107 S. Ct. 484 (1986). "
1126,15," The statutorily granted monopoly of patent rights is similar. HN25[
] Like a drug's 180-day exclusive market period, a patent 
grant in and of itself is ""an exception to the general rule against monopolies and to the right to a free and open market."" Walker 
Process Equip., Inc. v. Food Mach. & Chem. Corp., 382 U.S. 172, 177, 15 L. Ed. 2d 247, 86 S. Ct. 347 (1965) (quoting Precision 
Instrument Mfg. Co. v. Automotive Maintenance Mach. Co., 324 U.S. 806, 816, 89 L. Ed. 1381, 65 S. Ct. 993 (1945)). But even a 
patent-right holder is not immune from antitrust liability. In United States v. Singer Mfg. Co., 374 U.S. 174, 10 L. Ed. 2d 823, 83 
S. Ct. 1773 (1963), two competitors, Singer and Gegauf, entered into a cross-licensing agreement to settle a Patent Office 
interference proceeding involving their conflicting patent claims. Although Singer (like Andrx) had no obligation to pursue a 
patent grant and could have, on its own, withdrawn from the interference proceeding, it nevertheless acted unlawfully when it 
agreed with a competitor to settle the dispute, suppress information and exclude others from the market. See id. at 196; see also 
American Cyanimid Co., 72 F.T.C. 623 (1967), aff'd sub nom.  Charles Pfizer & Co. v. FTC, 401 F.2d 574 (6th Cir. 1968) 
(Tetracycline case)."
1126,16," The FDA has proposed a ""triggering period"" during which there must exist either a favorable court decision regarding the 
alleged infringed patent or the first applicant must begin commercial marketing. If the first applicant does neither, it forfeits its 
180-day exclusivity period. See 64 Fed. Reg. 42,877. ""In most cases, the triggering period would begin to run on the day a 
subsequent ANDA applicant with a paragraph IV certification receives a tentative approval stating that but for the first applicant's 
exclusivity, the subsequent ANDA would receive final approval."" Id. The triggering period would also begin to run upon expiration 
of any 30-month stay in place. "
1127,17," By contrast, a private agreement purporting to maintain the status quo may not be in the public interest or may have little 
likelihood of success on review. See generally Sheila F. Anthony, Prepared Remarks before the ABA ""Antitrust and Intellectual 
Property: The Crossroads"" Program, Riddles and Lessons from the Prescription Drug Wars: Antitrust Implications of Certain 
Types of Agreements Involving Intellectual Property (June 1, 2000), available at www.ftc.gov/speeches/anthony/sfip000601.htm."
1127,18," Biovail received tentative approval in October 1999. On November 5, 1999 Andrx petitioned for reconsideration and for a stay 
of the FDA's tentative approval. The parties dispute the effect of the petition on the timing of Biovail's final approval on 
December 23, 1999. Even if Biovail's damages period were relatively short, Biovail would nevertheless be able to seek recovery. 
Moreover, ""difficulty of ascertainment [should not be] confused with right of recovery."" McCready, 457 U.S. at 475 n.11 (quoting 
Bigelow, 327 U.S. at 265)."
1127,19," HN31[
] Antitrust standing also requires proximity between the alleged cause and the alleged injury. See Associated Gen. Contractors, 459 U.S. at 540; McCready, 457 U.S. at 476-77 ("" 'Despite the broad wording of § 4 there is a point beyond which 
the wrongdoer should not be held liable.' "" (citation omitted)); 2 Areeda et al., supra, P 339, at 325-26. In evaluating whether an 
injury is too remote, ""we look (1) to the physical and economic nexus between the alleged violation and the harm to the plaintiff, "
1128,," and (2), more particularly, to the relationship of the injury alleged with those forms of injury about which Congress was likely to 
have been concerned in making defendant's conduct unlawful and in providing a private remedy under § 4."" McCready, 457 U.S. 
at 478; see In re Multidistrict Vehicle Air Pollution M.D.L., 481 F.2d 122, 129 (9th Cir. 1973). In McCready, the Supreme Court 
held that health insurance subscribers had standing to sue their insurance company for colluding with physicians and 
psychiatrists to deny them reimbursement for payments made to psychologists. The Court acknowledged that while the 
psychologists (not the patients) were the targets of the conspiracy, standing ""cannot reasonably be restricted to those 
competitors whom the conspirators hoped to eliminate  [*817]  from the market."" McCready, 457 U.S. at 479. It thus affirmed the 
subscribers' standing. Applying the same reasoning, we conclude that Biovail's alleged injury is ""so integral an aspect"" of the 
alleged anticompetitive behavior, ""there can be no question but that the loss was precisely 'the type of loss that the claimed 
violations … would be likely to cause.' "" Id. (quoting Brunswick, 429 U.S. at 489). When a competitor is excluded from a market 
by the collusive acts of its rivals, its loss of profits is directly caused by that anticompetitive behavior. "
1129,20," Moreover, the Federal Trade Commission has withdrawn its complaint against HMRI and Andrx and entered into consent 
agreements with both manufacturers prospectively barring them from entering into certain anticompetitive agreements and 
requiring that future interim settlements of patent litigation be approved by the court with notice to the Commission. See 66 Fed. 
Reg. 18,636 (proposed consent decree)."
1129,21," The doctrine derives its name from two Supreme Court decisions. The first, Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr 
Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464, 81 S. Ct. 523 (1961), held that HN35[
] the antitrust laws do not apply to 
conduct resulting from valid government actions. The Supreme Court held that attempts by railroads to influence legislation 
designed to restrict competition from the trucking industry were exempt from antitrust liability. The Court remarked, ""no violation 
of the [Sherman] Act can be predicated upon mere attempts to influence the passage or enforcement of laws."" Id. at 135. The 
Court came to the same conclusion in Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626, 85 S. Ct. 1585 (1965). There, mine operators 
and workers petitioned the Executive Branch to induce the Tennessee Valley Authority to curtail spot market purchases and to 
increase minimum wages. The Court explained that ""HN36[
] joint efforts to influence public officials do not violate the antitrust 
laws even though intended to eliminate competition. Such conduct is not illegal, either standing alone or as a part of a broader 
scheme itself violative of the Sherman Act."" Id. at 670."
1129,22," See also 1 Areeda & Hovenkamp, supra, P 205e, at 238 (""Most lawsuits are prefaced by various communications, such as 
demand letters that expressly or impliedly threaten suit unless the addressee alters its conduct or provides other relief. Such 
prelitigation communications provide useful notice and facilitate the resolution of controversies. It would be foolish to adopt 
antitrust rules encouraging suit before communication by penalizing the communication but not the suit.""). "
1138,1," Although Haas does not segregate its ""no evidence"" claim as distinctly as we would prefer, we will address it separately 
hereinbelow. See Fletcher v. Edwards, 26 S.W.3d 66, 72 (Tex. App.--Waco 2000, pet. denied)."
1138,2," Because Branch does not seek to alter the judgment, we conclude that it may properly assert independent grounds for 
affirmance of the judgment even though it did not file its own notice of appeal. See TEX. R. APP. P. 25.1(c); Bosque Asset Corp. 
v. Greenberg, 19 S.W.3d 514, 520 (Tex. App.--Eastland 2000, pet. denied); Dean v. Lafayette Place (Section One) Council of 
Co-Owners, Inc., 999 S.W.2d 814, 818 (Tex. App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 1999, no pet.); see also First Gen. Realty Corp. v. 
Maryland Cas. Co., 981 S.W.2d 495, 503 (Tex. App.--Austin 1998, pet. denied). This seems particularly apt in a summary 
judgment case in which the movant is the appellee because the Supreme Court has expressly held that an ""appellate court may 
consider other grounds that the movant preserved for review and [the] trial court did not rule on in the interest of judicial 
economy."" Cincinnati Life Ins. Co. v. Cates, 927 S.W.2d 623, 626 (Tex. 1996); see also Bosque Asset Corp., 19 S.W.3d at 520. "
1139,3," Our rulings on the evidentiary questions presented do not necessarily establish the law of the case for any subsequent 
proceedings. Our Supreme Court has held that HN5[
] the law of the case doctrine has limited application following a summary 
judgment appeal. See Hudson v. Wakefield, 711 S.W.2d 628, 630-31 (Tex. 1986); accord National Union Fire Ins. Co. v. John 
Zink Co., 972 S.W.2d 839, 845 (Tex. App.--Corpus Christi 1998, pet. denied); Pitman v. Lightfoot, 937 S.W.2d 496, 512-13 (Tex. 
App.--San Antonio 1996, writ denied). Thus, on remand the parties may assert additional theories or facts which might require a 
different ruling regarding the admissibility of a particular piece of evidence. Id. "
1140,4, Haas does not challenge the court's overruling of its objections to Appellants' summary judgment evidence.
1140,5," Many of Branch's objections go to ""statements"" contained within the deposition questions propounded by the Ashes' counsel. 
However, HN8[
] unsworn statements of counsel generally do not constitute evidence. See Banda v. Garcia, 955 S.W.2d 270,"
1140,272," (Tex. 1997); Leaird's, Inc. v. Wrangler, Inc., 31 S.W.3d 688, 691 (Tex. App.--Waco 2000, pet. denied). Branch did not object 
to the form of counsel's questions. Accordingly, we limit our review to the admissibility of the various deponents' testimony 
(including those instances in which a witness was asked to affirm that a particular statement was made). "
1141,6," The fact that Anderson did not identify the Hilliard employee affects only the weight and credibility of his testimony and not its 
admissibility. See Yellow Freight Sys., Inc. v. North Am. Cabinet Corp., 670 S.W.2d 387, 390 (Tex. App.--Texarkana 1984, no 
writ). "
1142,7," Because we will conclude that the record contains no evidence that Branch interfered with the Ashes' contractual relations with 
J.J.'s, we do not set out the elements of a claim for tortious interference with a contract. The Supreme Court has most recently 
listed those elements in Powell Industries, Inc. v. Allen, 985 S.W.2d 455, 456 (Tex. 1998). "
1145,8," Haas quoted paragraph 2(a) in his summary judgment affidavit, which we have already determined we will not consider. 
According to the pleading Appellants filed with this excerpt from the Miller contract, the parties have agreed to keep the 
distributors' contracts with the breweries confidential. "
1153,1," Defendants do attempt to argue that Plaintiff has failed to establish evidence under the second and third elements of a § 1 
violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. However, the Court finds that the issues surrounding the second and third elements are 
not adequately briefed by either party. Therefore, the Court declines to rule on these issues at this time. "
1165,1," The plan elsewhere defines ""discretionary vehicles"" as ""vehicles to be used as demonstrators by [SNE]; vehicles to be used for 
major auto shows; vehicles set aside to assist dealers who, at the sole discretion of [SNE], need assistance and vehicles 
delivered to VIPs."" Fair Share II at 000027."
1165,2," I described many of plaintiffs' factual allegations and legal claims in more detail in two previous orders. See George Lussier 
Enters., Inc. v. Subaru of New England, Inc., 2000 DNH 013, Civil No. C-99-109-B, 2000 WL 1466132 (D.N.H. Jan. 13, 2000) 
(granting motion to dismiss prior RICO claims against SNE; granting in part and denying in part motion to dismiss prior RICO 
claim against Boch); George Lussier Enters., Inc. v. Subaru of New England, Inc., 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19769, Civil No. C-99-
109-B, 1999 WL 1327396 (D.N.H. Dec. 13, 1999) (denying motion to dismiss antitrust claim against SNE). "
1170,3," At the class certification hearing, defendants argued, for the first time, that plaintiffs would be unable to offer common proof of 
the information and switching costs necessary to prove the market-power element of a lock-in tying claim. Transcript (""Tr."") of 
Hearing on Jan. 29, 2001, (Doc. No. 219), at 69, 110-11; see George Lussier Enters., Inc., 1999 WL 1327396, *3-5 (discussing 
information and switching costs). Since defendants did not brief this issue, however, I need not dwell on it here. I find, however, 
that because a number of other common questions predominate over individual questions in this case, plaintiffs' need to prove 
switching and information costs does not defeat a finding of predominance. See Collins v. Int'l Dairy Queen, Inc., 168 F.R.D. 
668, 676 (M.D. Ga. 1996) (certifying lock-in tying claim without directly addressing the issue of switching and information costs); 
see also Mowbray, 208 F.3d at 298. "
1171,4," While few cases actually use the term ""announced tie,"" but see, e.g., Little Caesar Enters., Inc., 172 F.R.D. at 265 (""The 
commonality of proofs of a tie-in is an easy issue where there is an express contractual tie or an announced tie-in.""), the case 
law suggests that a non-contractual statement can create an inference of conditioning. See, e.g., Bogus v. Am. Speech & 
Hearing Ass'n, 582 F.2d 277, 287 (3d Cir. 1978) (finding conditioning where association's internal rule required membership in 
the organization in order to be eligible for professional certification); B.J.L.M. Liquor Store, Inc. v. Block Distrib. Co., 1987 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 6473, Civ. A. No. L-85-64, 1987 WL 13811, *2 (S.D. Tex. Apr. 2, 1987) (assuming that non-contractual statement 
constituted an attempted tying arrangement); Martino v. McDonald's Sys., Inc., 81 F.R.D. 81, 88-89 (N.D. Ill. 1979) (finding that 
conditioning could be shown on a class-wide basis where employee testified that he told 99% of prospective franchisees that a 
tying condition existed because this evidence established a ""firm policy"" of conditioning); see also Trans Sport, Inc. v. Starter 
Sportswear, Inc., 964 F.2d 186, 192 (2d Cir. 1992) (holding that company's policy statement did not establish tying arrangement 
because it was ambiguous and the plaintiff offered no evidence that it was ever implemented). "
1173,5," Further, even if defendants successfully rebut the presumption of conditioning, there is no guarantee that the plaintiffs would 
offer individual dealer testimony. Indeed, at oral argument plaintiffs suggested that they might not offer such testimony. Tr. at 21. 
Creative lawyering leaves open the prospect of other methods of proof. See Bogosian, 561 F.2d at 452; Little Caesar Enters., 
Inc., 172 F.R.D. at 253. "
1175,6," HN25[
] When the facts of a case dictate that a class can not offer common proof of conditioning, each individual class 
member must offer ""some proof that [he] did not accept the tied product voluntarily, but was forced to take it."" See Antitrust Law 
Developments, supra, at 188. Courts often refer to this as a need to prove conditioning via a showing of ""coercion."" See, e.g., 
Petrolera Caribe, Inc., 735 F.2d at 638 (""As there is no express contractual tie, [the plaintiff] must prove 'coercion.'"" (citation 
omitted)); see also Areeda P 1752e, at 283-86 (discussion coercion); Antitrust Law Developments, supra, at 188-89 (same); 
William C. Holmes, Antitrust Law Handbook 432-33 (1999 ed.) (""Common paraphrasings of the [conditioning] requirement are 
that ""coercion"" or ""forcing"" must be proven.""). To prove ""coercion,"" an individual buyer must show that he did not want to purchase the tying product but he did so only 
because the seller conditioned his purchase of the tied product, through, for example, threats, pressure or intimidation, on his 
purchase of the tying product. See Bogosian, 561 F.2d at 451. Thus, unlike common proofs of conditioning, which focus on the "
1176,," seller, this inquiry focuses on: (1) the buyer's state of mind as to the desirability of both the tied and tying product; and (2) her 
interactions with the seller. HN26[
] Courts are reluctant to certify a class where conditioning must be established by individualized instances of coercion 
because individual questions as to a buyer's state of mind and the nature of her interactions with the seller tend to predominate 
over issues common to the class. See, e.g., Ungar, 531 F.2d at 1226; Chase Parkway Garage, Inc., 94 F.R.D. at 332."
1176,7," In Bogosian, the court stated that ""if class certification is granted, plaintiffs will be precluded from introducing evidence of 
threats of termination to prove the existence of a tie-in."" 561 F.2d at 452-53 n.12. Accordingly, defendants argue that I should 
bar plaintiffs from introducing any individual testimony in support of their unannounced tying claim. Because I find, however, that 
it is conceivable that individual dealer testimony could be offered in this case without upsetting the predominance of common 
issues, I reject defendants' argument. "
1177,8," In a prior Memorandum and Order, I concluded that, based on the allegations contained in plaintiffs' initial complaint, ""neither 
the New England Subaru Dealer Network nor Subaru of America can satisfy the enterprise element of the dealers' § 1962(c) 
claims against SNE."" George Lussier Enters., Inc., 2000 DNH 13, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1080, *14, 2000 WL 1466132, *5. 
Accordingly, I granted SNE's motion to dismiss Count I of plaintiffs' initial complaint. Id. At this time, however, defendants do not 
challenge the sufficiency of this aspect of plaintiffs' Second Amended Complaint. See Eisen, 417 U.S. at 177. "
1178,9," This disagreement is significant in the class certification context because, in many cases, proof of reliance will require a 
searching, individualized inquiry that defeats a finding of predominance. See, e.g., Rothwell, 191 F.R.D. at 31 (agreeing with ""the 
majority view that certification generally is inappropriate where individual reliance is an issue"" and finding that the predominance 
requirement was not satisfied). Issues of reliance can be especially troublesome where the plaintiffs base their claims ""on oral 
misrepresentations, which, by their nature, tend to be particularized."" Id. at 30 (citations omitted). "

1993), and In re Matter of Olin Corp., 113 F.T.C. 400 (1990). "
1188,2," This section provides: HN2[
] A final judgment or decree heretofore or hereafter rendered in any civil or criminal proceeding brought by or on 
behalf of the United States under the antitrust laws to the effect that a defendant has violated said laws shall be prima facie 
evidence against such defendant in any action or proceeding brought by any other party against such defendant under said 
laws as to all  [*1031]  matters respecting which said judgment or decree would be an estoppel as between the parties 
thereto: Provided, That this section shall not apply to consent judgments or decrees entered before any testimony has been 
taken. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to impose any limitation on the application of collateral estoppel, 
except that, in any action or proceeding brought under the antitrust laws, collateral estoppel effect shall not be given to any 
finding made by the Federal Trade Commission under the antitrust laws or under section 45 of this title which could give 
rise to a claim for relief under the antitrust laws."
1188,15, U.S.C. § 16(a).
1188,3," We have previously held that an FTC order constitutes a final judgment for purposes of Section 5. See Purex Corp., Ltd. v. 
Proctor & Gamble Co., 453 F.2d 288, 290-91 (9th Cir. 1971). "
1189,4," Under Section 5, prima facie weight is given only to violations of the ""antitrust laws"" as defined by the Clayton Act. This does 
not include violations of the FTC Act. See Section 1(a) of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 12(a); Nashville Milk Co. v. Carnation Co., 
355 U.S. 373, 375-76, 2 L. Ed. 2d 340, 78 S. Ct. 352 (1958); Yamaha Motor Co., Ltd. v. FTC, 657 F.2d 971, 982 (8th Cir. 1981). 
Appellees did not raise the argument in the district court or on appeal that the findings of fact and conclusions of law made in 
connection with the violation of Section 5 of the FTC Act were not entitled to prima facie weight. Accordingly, we do not address 
that issue. "
1190,5," After reviewing the ALJ's conclusions of law, it is clear to us that none of them is relevant or identical to issues raised in this 
proceeding for the reasons discussed above. "
1191,6," HN12[
] The requirements for maintaining an antitrust suit under California law mirror the federal requirements.  Kentmaster Mfg. Co. v. Jarvis Prods. Corp., 146 F.3d 691, 695 (9th Cir. 1998), as amended 164 F.3d 1243 (9th Cir. 1999)). Therefore, our 
resolution of the federal claims also resolves the state law claims. Id. "
1193,7," Because our determination that plaintiffs have failed to establish antitrust injury does not depend upon the admissibility of the 
disputed evidence, we decline to address the motions in limine. "
1197,*," Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation. "
1198,1, The Sherman Act § 1 claim was dismissed without prejudice prior to the district court's summary judgment decision.
1198,2," HN5[
] Municipalities in the Commonwealth are authorized to ""further regulate"" billboards within their city limits. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93 § 29."
1198,3," In general, outdoor advertisers such as AK and RSA own the billboard structures and the permits to operate those billboards, 
and negotiate leases with the third party owners of the land on which the billboard sits. In some cases, the third party landlord 
will own both the property and the billboard structure, and contract with the permit-holder to operate the billboard."
1198,4," Although, at times, RSA quibbles with this description of the regulatory regime, it conceded in its appellate brief that the 
replacement of grandfathered billboards is virtually impossible, as it requires either a variance from a municipal zoning board 
and/or a change in state or federal law. At oral argument, RSA admitted that the complex regulatory scheme severely limited the 
possibility that any new billboards could be built in Greater Boston. "
1199,5," HN8[
] ""Any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue therefor . . . ."" 15 U.S.C. § 15. "
1200,6," Although RSA criticizes the district court for failing to consider factors other than causation in its standing determination, it does 
not cite any persuasive case law suggesting that non-causation factors can prevail in the absence of causation, and it admits 
that this Court's denials of standing generally rest on the absence of antitrust injury."
1200,7," This one instance of a variance being granted is not very persuasive evidence that RSA will be able to replace a billboard 
destroyed by AK. The documents in the record related to this variance make it clear that AK removed and replaced an old 
billboard structure with a newer one in order to improve parking in the area. The circumstances in which RSA would seek a 
variance are very different, in that RSA would seek to erect a billboard on a lot where one no longer existed (because of AK's 
action). "
1201,8," Were we to entertain such an argument, it would fall under the category of exclusionary refusals to deal; i.e., the rare case in 
which a monopolist has an affirmative duty to do business with a competitor. See Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing 
Corp., 472 U.S. 585, 602-05, 86 L. Ed. 2d 467, 105 S. Ct. 2847 (1985); Otter Tail Power Co. v. United States, 410 U.S. 366, 
377-78, 35 L. Ed. 2d 359, 93 S. Ct. 1022 (1973). Not only did RSA not make such an argument before the district court, it 
specifically disclaimed it. See RSA Memorandum in Opposition to Motion for Summary Judgment at 37 n.22. "
1214,1," The plaintiffs may find themselves in a difficult position upon completion of discovery. If they provide sufficient evidence that 
Press Network was not controlled by Gazette but was functioning independently (in order to avoid application of the 
intracorporate conspiracy doctrine), they may weaken their ability to provide evidence, as required by Monsanto Co. v. Spray-
Rite Service Corp., 465 U.S. 752, 764, 79 L. Ed. 2d 775, 104 S. Ct. 1464 (1984), that eliminates the possibility that Press 
Network was acting independently from Gazette and Post. "
1217,2," For the same reasons, Rossignol's claim for unfair competition will also be dismissed against Press Network."
1217,3," Murray also lacks standing to bring the other claims alleged in the Complaint, as she is not a copyright holder under Count V, 
she has not suffered any injury such that she would have standing to assert a claim for unfair competition under Count VI, and 
she is not a party to the contract that is the subject of Counts VII or VIII. Therefore, she will be dismissed from the case 
completely. "
1218,4," The complaint alleges that the claim is being brought under Section 3 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 14, but it appears to be a 
claim for price discrimination under Section 2(a), as amended by the Robinson-Patman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 13(a). The parties' 
memoranda have analyzed the claim as being the latter, and therefore the Court will analyze the claim as being one for price 
discrimination under 15 U.S.C. § 13(a). In any event, the majority of courts that have considered the issue have found that 
HN20[
] advertising is not a commodity under Section 2 or Section 3 of the Clayton Act, as will be discussed infra. See Oppenheim & Shields, Newspapers and the Antitrust Laws, § 75, at 285. "
1220,5, There are statutory exceptions to this requirement but none applies here. See 17 U.S.C. § 411(a). 
1221,6," Common law copyright has largely been preempted by the Copyright Act. See Community for Creative Non-Violence v. Reid, 
490 U.S. 730, 740, 104 L. Ed. 2d 811, 109 S. Ct. 2166 (1989) (citing 17 U.S.C. § 301(a)). HN31[
] Section 301(a) states that any rights ""equivalent to any of the exclusive rights within the general scope of copyright . . . are governed exclusively by this 
title. Thereafter, no person is entitled to any such right or equivalent right in any such work under the common law or statutes of 
any State."""
1221,7," There is a limited exception to this in the case of a published work if registration is made within three months after the first 
publication of the work. See 17 U.S.C. 412(2). This exception does not apply here."
1221,8," Plaintiff Murray lacks standing to bring this claim, as she has not alleged an injury sufficient for standing. Even assuming that 
she has standing as a consumer to assert a claim for unfair competition, she has failed to allege that she subscribes to any of 
the papers that are the subject of this complaint, and therefore, cannot show how she has been injured. In addition, because the 
complaint lacks any mention of any conduct by Press Network which could have affected plaintiff Rossignol, Plaintiff Rossignol 
has failed to adequately plead an unfair competition claim against Press Network. "
1226,*," This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be 
provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3. "
1241,1," ""Sheft Kahn and certain New York Region MB Centers exchanged confidential information concerning pricing strategies in 
order to foster the goals of the conspiracy."" Complaint P 34. "
1245,2," Plaintiff Dynamic and the fact that it and Kirkpatrick leased their automobiles do not appear in the complaint as filed. The 
parties have stipulated that the relevant paragraphs should be amended for the purposes of this motion to include these facts, 
without altering the nature of the motion from a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. "
1264,1," As noted, the Louisiana Supreme Court reversed the order staying LDRA's racing license. Because Jefferson Downs and Fair 
Grounds had omitted to request a stay while they took this appeal to the Louisiana Supreme Court, however, the Commission 
issued LDRA's permit while the appeal was pending. "
1265,2," Under § 13:4163, a member of the state legislature may request that any lawsuit in which he or she is personally involved, 
either as a party or as counsel, be continued until after the current legislative session is finally adjourned. See La. Rev. Stat. § 
13:4163 (West 1993). "
1266,3," Apparently aware of this restriction, LDRA had amended its original application for a racing license to omit its request for an 
OTB license. See Livingston Downs, 705 So. 2d at 151."
1266,4," While LDRA's appeal was pending, it filed a second lawsuit challenging the validity of the statutes establishing limits for 
payouts on video poker machines. These statutes also favored race tracks in operation during or prior to the 1986-87 season by 
permitting them to make higher payouts than other facilities. This suit was consolidated with LDRA's already pending declaratory 
judgment action. See Livingston Downs, 705 So. 2d at 151; see also original complaint PP 128, 130."
1266,5," The Louisiana Constitution permits a direct appeal to the Louisiana Supreme Court whenever a trial court deems an ordinance 
or law unconstitutional. See LA Const. art. 5. § 5(D) (West 1999)."
1266,6," At this time, LDRA's challenge to the state's OTB statutes was still pending. See Livingston Downs, 705 So. 2d at 149. "
1267,7," The revocation of LDRA's racing license also prompted Odom to file, as part of his lawsuit challenging the referendum election 
in Livingston Parish, a new motion urging that the election be declared a nullity. This motion was denied and Odom's suit later 
dismissed upon LDRA's motion. See id. P 109. "
1268,8," This statute, which ultimately included such a restriction, was challenged by LDRA in one of its lawsuits. See supra note 4. The 
action was consolidated with LDRA's lawsuit contesting the statute which prohibited tracks not in existence during or prior to the 
1986-87 season from conducting OTB operations. See id. "
1269,9," HN3[
] Noerr-Pennington immunity represents an affirmative defense. See Acoustic Systems, Inc. v. Wenger Corp., 207 F.3d 287, 296 (5th Cir. 2000). If not raised in the defendant's first responsive pleading, therefore, the defense will be waived. 
See Lucas v. United States, 807 F.2d 414, 417 (5th Cir. 1986); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b). Because the defendants raised 
the defense in their answer, it is properly before the Court."
1269,10," HN6[
] Referring to the Noerr-Pennington doctrine as an antitrust immunity is somewhat of a misnomer, for the doctrine 
provides only a defense to liability, not immunity from suit. See Acoustic Sys., Inc. v. Wenger Corp., 207 F.3d 287, 295 (5th 
Cir. 2000). Because it is often referred to as an immunity, however, the Court will refer to it as such as well. "
1272,11," HN15[
] The statute creating the Commission expressly denotes the agency as a component of the executive branch. See La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 4:144 (West Supp. 2001) (""There is hereby created in the executive branch of state government a racing 
commission, to be known as the ""Louisiana State Racing Commission."" (emphasis added)). "
1273,12, See La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 49:950 et seq. (APA)
1273,13, See La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 42:4.1 et seq. (Open Meeting Law).
1273,14," The Ninth Circuit has held that HN17[
] the sham exception applies to petitioning efforts directed toward executive entities 
only to the extent that ""[the executive entity's] actions are guided by enforceable standards subject to review."" Manistee Town 
Ctr. v. City of Glendale, 227 F.3d 1090, 1094 (9th Cir. 2000) (internal citation and quotation omitted). The Court finds this 
rationale persuasive, for petitions which do not involve the individualized application of established principles cannot be reviewed 
for objective merit, as required under Professional Real Estate Investors. See id. Given that several of the Commission's 
decisions were appealed to the state courts, it is clear that these decisions, at least, were subject to review. Hence, the sham 
exception is applicable to these petitions, even under the more rigorous approach of Manistee Town Center. Although it is 
uncertain whether all the Commission's decisions were guided by established rules and were subject to review, absent any 
evidence or argument to the contrary, the Court will presume, without finding, that they were. See Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248-49 
(on summary judgment, the court must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party). Hence, the Court finds 
the sham exception available as to all of LDRA's claims of sham petitioning before the Commission. "
1274,15," LDRA asserts in its complaint that the Commission refused to produce the letter prior to the hearing on LDRA's OTB license. 
See Original Complaint P 102. Yet LDRA offers no explanation for its failure to obtain the letter through discovery, nor has it 
requested additional time to do so. "
1275,16," The Supreme Court has intimated that the exception for conspiracies may remain viable when the Government is a market 
participant. See Omni, 499 U.S. at 379. LDRA does not make such an assertion, and the record clearly does not support one. "
1276,17," The Court notes an apparent logical inconsistency in the POSCO holding. The POSCO court asserts that its test is 
prospective and that, in the multiple-suit context, the outcome of the contested lawsuits is inapposite. Yet the POSCO court 
begins its analysis by examining the outcomes of the challenged suits and reasoning that, because more than half of them were 
successful, they could not be shams. See USS-POSCO, 31 F.3d at 811. By turning first to the outcomes of the challenged 
lawsuits, the POSCO court would seem to have controverted its own ""prospective"" approach. This inconsistency, however, is 
reconcilable with the POSCO court's stated rationale. The POSCO court relied upon the outcomes of the challenged lawsuits 
merely as circumstantial evidence of the defendants' intent in filing them. In effect, the POSCO court inferred that, inasmuch as 
most of the suits had merit, the defendants' purpose in filing them was not to delay or harass the plaintiff, but rather was to 
achieve a favorable ruling. Moreover, that more than 50% of the cases turned out to have merit informs the question whether the 
suits were filed automatically, without regard to the merits."
1276,18," There are, in addition, two suits filed by the Plaintiff against the Defendants. See LDRA v. Committee to Control Gambling, 
Inc., No. 67,822 (Livingston Parish) and LDRA v. Bryan Krantz, No. 68,605 (Livingston Parish). Although the Fifth Circuit has 
suggested that defending a lawsuit can fall within the sham exception if the defendant does not honestly desire to affect the 
outcome of the case. see In re Burlington, 822 F.2d 518 at 532-33, the continued validity of that position is highly suspect in 
the wake of Professional Real Estate Investors."
1276,19," The Court is mindful of the significant distinction between initiating a lawsuit and merely intervening in a lawsuit that has 
already been filed. Cf. Falise v. American Tobacco Co., 94 F. Supp. 2d 316, 351 (E.D.N.Y. 2000). The former behavior poses 
a far greater opportunity for the defendant to impose economic injury upon a rival. This is because, in the latter instance, the rival 
has already undertaken the costs and risks that attend litigation. Yet if the key to the application the sham exception is the abuse 
of the adjudicatory process, as the Supreme Court has suggested, see California Motor, 404 U.S. at 513, then there remains a 
palpable risk that parties, though only intervenors, can pervert the machinery of the courts to harass rivals who are already 
there. This case illustrates how such abuse might be carried out. The Defendant here unsuccessfully appealed unfavorable 
rulings in other cases, thereby prolonging the litigation well beyond its normal terminus. "
1277,20," By the Court's reckoning, the successful suits include: (1) the suit seeking a stay of the Commission's decision to grant LDRA 
a racing license; (2) LDRA's suit, in which Defendants intervened, challenging the legitimacy of the state's racing-license statute; 
and (3) LDRA's suit, in which Defendants also intervened, contesting the validity of the state's video-poker statute. LDRA avers 
that the Defendants should be held responsible for the Commission's vigorous defense of LDRA's suit, filed on April 29, 1994, 
challenging the Commission's decision to revoke LDRA's racing license. Even assuming that the Defendants can be charged 
with this suit and that mere defense of a lawsuit can constitute sham litigation, that action culminated in a consent judgment. 
Given that outcome, it is difficult to conclude that the Defendants' position in that dispute was baseless."
1277,21," LDRA makes much of the fact that the Defendants solicited ""straw plaintiffs"" in order to obtain standing to file its lawsuits. It is 
true that the Fifth Circuit held in Burlington Northern that individuals who lack standing to bring suit in their own right are not 
entitled to Noerr immunity. See Burlington Northern, 822 F.2d at 531. The few courts to consider the question in the wake of 
Professional Real Estate Investors, however, have found the presence of straw plaintiffs not to be germane when assessing 
the applicability of the sham exception. See Baltimore Scrap, 237 F.3d 394 at 401; see also Liberty Lake Investments, Inc. v. 
Magnuson, 12 F.3d 155, 157-59 (9th Cir. 1993). The Court sees no reason to deny outright Noerr immunity to those who lack 
standing in a particular action. Nevertheless, the fact that straw plaintiffs were used can be instructive as to whether the 
contested litigation was instituted in genuine hope of obtaining relief or merely in an effort to harass a business competitor. 
Because the Court is applying the prospective analysis of California Motor in this case, it will consider the evidence of straw 
plaintiffs for this limited purpose."
1277,22, These actions were consolidated at trial. 
1278,23," Even if the individual members of the Commission remained party to this action, they would doubtlessly be entitled to the 
Parker exemption. See Earles v. State Bd. of Certified Public Accountants of Louisiana, 139 F.3d 1033, 1041-42 (5th Cir. 
1998) (noting that individual members of a state certification board were entitled to the Parker exemption because their actions 
in adopting and enforcing rules were taken ""pursuant to state policy to displace competition with regulation or monopoly public 
service"" that was ""clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed). "
1279,24," This would seem to be a counterfactual assertion. LDRA's RICO case statement identifies four predicate acts that comprise 
the foundation of its RICO claims. See doc. no. 74. These acts include the Thomas and Odom litigation, but they also include 
""the actions taken by the Committee to Control Gambling in attempting to persuade citizens of Livingston Parish to vote down 
the referendum election on live horse racing"" and ""the actions taken by Bankston before the Louisiana State Racing 
Commission."" See id. at 13-14. LDRA unsuccessfully raised the latter two claims in its state-court action under Louisiana's 
Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act. See Def.'s Exh. O & P. "
1287,1," The Blackout Rule ""means the NFL rule precluding the televising, within a Club's home territory, of home games not sold out 
seventy-two (72) hours in advance of game time."" For the sake of simplicity, the court will refer to the games available on NFL 
Sunday Ticket as ""NFL regular season Sunday afternoon games."" "
1288,2," When the original complaint as well as the second (and last) amended complaint was filed, Charles Shaw was a class 
representative in the action. On August 24, 2000, the court approved the parties' joint stipulation dismissing Mr. Shaw as a class 
representative. Mr. Shaw's dismissal left Bret D. Schwartz and Steve Promislo as the only class representatives. "
1289,3," On August 6, 1999, due to the death of Judge Gawthrop, the case was reassigned to the docket of Judge Robreno."
1289,4," In an affidavit from Donald E. Haviland, Jr., Esq., one of the attorneys for the plaintiffs, counsel stated that defendants have 
produced over 61,000 documents, including documents from non-defendant NFL member teams. In addition, plaintiffs took 
depositions of thirteen (13) NFL witnesses, as well as three (3) additional witnesses from non-defendant NFL teams. Plaintiff 
also served subpoenas for documents and depositions on non-party witnesses, including the broadcast networks, cable 
companies, Nielsen Media Research, Echostar, and DirectTV. In particular, plaintiffs received over 12,000 pages of documents 
produced by DirectTV and conducted depositions of five (5) of its employees."
1289,5," NFL Sunday Ticket broadcasts via satellite transmission all regular season games, as opposed to pre- or post-season games, 
scheduled on Sunday afternoons at 1:00 p.m. and 4:15 p.m. that are not subject to the Blackout Rule. Regular season games 
are those NFL games which count toward the competitive standings of the individual member teams and which determine which "
1290,," of the member teams will play in the post-season games, commonly known as the ""playoffs"" and the ""Super Bowl."" Games 
played before the start of the regular season which do not count toward the competitive standings are called pre-season games. 
Neither post-season games nor pre-season games are included in either NFL Sunday Ticket or Single Sunday Ticket."
1290,6," The Settlement Agreement defines ""baseline net revenue"" as the ""net subscription revenues for the 2000 season, increased 
proportionately each season thereafter to reflect the percentage increase in the total number of satellite television subscribers to 
DirectTV. Such percentage increases shall be calculated based on the total number of satellite television subscribers to DirectTV 
as of January 1 of each applicable year."" Stipulation and Settlement Agreement P II(e)."
1290,7," For purposes of determining whether or not a class member is entitled to the 15% discount, the Settlement Agreement 
excludes from the determination of the number of purchased seasons the following: (a) the 1994 NFL season, if the subscription was purchased from DirectTV; (b) a season in which the Class Member 
received a portion or all of the NFL Sunday Ticket subscription ""free"" (e.g., with the purchase of a satellite dish); (c) a 
season in which the Class Member terminated his subscription and received a complete or partial refund; and (d) a season 
in which the Class Member failed to make a complete payment for his or her subscription. Stipulation and Settlement Agreement P VI.3. "
1291,8," The Settlement Agreement defines the ""closing date"" as ""the date, following court approval, upon which, by lapse of time or 
otherwise, including any appeals, the judgment entered thereon shall no longer be subject to review or appeal, provided than 
any appeals shall have been resolved in such a manner as to permit the consummation of this Agreement in its entirety."" 
Stipulation and Settlement Agreement P II(k)."
1291,9," The defendants also agreed to pay up to $ 1,000 to each named plaintiff as an incentive award. The named plaintiffs were told 
to submit affidavits in support of such an award. As the court's decision denying final approval does not rest on the legitimacy of 
these awards, this opinion does not address them. "
1292,10," On May 17, 2001, upon request by the parties, the deadline for mailing class notice and publishing the class notice was 
extended to May 30, 2001. Additionally, the deadlines for class members to file claims forms, requests to be excluded, and 
objections to the settlement were extended."
1292,11," Although plaintiffs' counsel estimated that there were ten objections to the Settlement Agreement, the court notes that 
approximately ten other objections were sent directly to the court and then filed of record."
1292,12," At the hearing on preliminary approval, this court told the parties and counsel agreed that a decision granting preliminary 
approval does not bind the court to granting final approval. Hearing on Preliminary Approval, Tr. 03/02/01 at 86-87 (stating that 
""you could have a preliminary approval which is on a lower standard, which however upon final reflection would not meet the 
final approval""). As noted by the Third Circuit, ""[the] preliminary determination establishes an initial presumption of fairness. . . ."" 
In re General Motors Corp., 55 F.3d 768, 784 (3d Cir. 1995) (emphasis added). As noted in the Manual for Complex Litigation, 
Second, ""if the proposed settlement appears to be the product of serious, informed, non-collusive negotiations, has no obvious 
deficiencies, does not improperly grant preferential treatment to class representatives or segments of the class, and falls within 
the range of possible approval, then the court should direct that the notice be given to the class members of a formal fairness 
hearing . . . ."" Manual for Complex Litigation, Second § 30.44 (1985). In addition, ""the court may find that the settlement proposal 
contains some merit, is within the range of reasonableness required for a settlement offer, or is presumptively valid."" Newberg 
on Class Actions § 11.25 (1992). In this case, the court's memorandum and order stated that the proposed settlement ""upon 
preliminary review, to be fair, adequate, and reasonable, and shall be submitted to the class members for their consideration and 
for a hearing to determine whether the settlement will be approved by the court."" Memorandum and Order, May 10, 2001, at 2. "
1293,," Later in the opinion, the court noted that it found the settlement fell within ""the range of reasonableness"" and ""tentatively"" 
approved the settlement. Id. at 14, 15."
1293,13," For a summary of the key role class counsel plays in the litigation of class actions, see William J. Lyhnk, The Courts and the 
Plaintiffs' Bar: Awarding the Attorneys' Fees in Class Action Litigation, 23 J. Legal Stud. 185, 185 (1994). "
1295,14," It is true that by declining to provide Single Sunday Ticket after the 2002 NFL football season, the defendants would lose the 
protection of the release and covenant not to sue, and, therefore, defendants have an incentive to continue to provide Single 
Sunday Ticket. Still, the obligation under the Settlement Agreement is limited to the 2001 NFL football season and, under certain 
conditions, the 2002 NFL football season. "
1296,15," Plaintiffs' counsel did not state how much lower this figure should be based on a 17% response rate. However, adjusting the 
response rate to 17% and the number of class members who responded to 300,000, and applying those figures to counsel's 
equation, the figure is $ 2,437,500. "
1297,16," The parties also have compared incorrectly the value in the Settlement Agreement to the claims asserted in the complaint. As 
to injunctive relief, while the parties estimate the value of the prospective remedy set forth in the Settlement Agreement for two 
years at $ 12 million, they failed to put any value on the sweeping, permanent injunctive relief sought in the complaint. Therefore, 
the parties have placed value on the release provided in the Settlement Agreement but not the remedy requested in the 
complaint."
1297,17," In the event that the cost of notice and administration exceeds $ 2.3 million, the $ 7.5 million settlement fund will be reduced to 
pay those costs in full before distribution to the class."
1297,18," The sole departure is plaintiffs' assertion that defendants were involved in anticompetitive behavior with respect to ""live video 
broadcasts of NFL professional football games through non-exempt channels of distribution,"" but even this claim is enmeshed in "
1298,," the allegation that the defendants' anticompetitive behavior was ""effectuated"" by the means employed in marketing and selling 
NFL Sunday Ticket. Second Amended Complaint PP 59-60."
1298,19," Plaintiffs' response to defendants' first interrogatory reads in pertinent part: (a) Plaintiffs claim that defendants and the member clubs violated § 1 of the Sherman Act essentially in the following ways: 
(1) agreeing among themselves not to individually sell NFL game telecasts in non-exempt channels of distribution but rather 
to sell those telecasts jointly (agreement not to compete); (2) agreeing not to sell Sunday afternoon NFL game telecasts 
except through a single satellite distributor; (3) agreeing to sell Sunday afternoon NFL game telecasts in only one non-
exempt channel of distribution in the U.S. (i.e., satellite); (4) offering for sale through satellite a single package of all the 
Sunday afternoon games and no other product; and (5) agreeing on a fixed price for the sale of broadcasts in the satellite 
distribution channel."
1298,20," At the hearing, defense counsel explained that the NFL has been experimenting with making some games available on the 
Internet. Admittedly, however, this fact was not developed during the litigation. "
1299,21," Under the Settlement Agreement, plaintiffs' counsel has capped their attorneys' fees and expenses at $ 3.7 million. In their 
papers, plaintiffs' counsel indicates that to date their current overall lodestar figure is $ 3,006,656.00 and their current expenses 
are $ 824,972.82, for a total of $ 3,831,628.82 in fees and expenses. Therefore, a payment of $ 3.7 million for fees and 
expenses represents 96.5% of counsel's reported total for fees and expenses. Assuming that plaintiffs' counsel will pay all of 
their expenses out of the $ 3.7 million, the remaining portion is $ 2,875,027.18, which will be attorneys' fees. This latter figures 
represents 95% of the current overall lodestar figure reported by counsel. "
1300,22," The calculation of the amount of the defendant's cash contribution to the settlement is as follows: $ 2.3 million in notice and 
administrative costs; $ 3.7 in attorneys' fees and expenses; and $ 7.5 million for the settlement fund. The total of this equals $ 
13.5 million and the attorneys' fees and expenses represent approximately 27.5% of this total."
1300,23, See supra note 21 for a discussion of this figure. 
1301,24," The Court distinguishes the rule-of-reason analysis and the illegal per se rule as follows: In the first category are agreements whose nature and necessary effect are so plainly anticompetitive that no elaborate 
study of the industry is needed to establish their illegality--they are ""illegal per se."" In the second category are agreements 
whose competitive effect can only be evaluated by analyzing the facts peculiar to the business, the history of the restraint, 
and the reasons why it was imposed. Fed. Trade Comm'n v. Superior Court Trial Lawyers Assoc., 493 U.S. 411, 433, 107 L. Ed. 2d 851, 110 S. Ct. 768 (1990) 
(quoting Nat'l Soc'y of Prof'l Eng'rs v. United States, 435 U.S. 679, 692, 98 S. Ct. 1355, 55 L. Ed. 2d 637 (1978))."
1301,25," The Court has described the ""quick look"" analysis as the situation where ""an observer with even a rudimentary understanding 
of economics could conclude that the arrangements in question would have an anticompetitive effect on customers and 
markets."" Cal. Dental Assoc. v. Fed. Trade Comm'n, 526 U.S. 756, 769, 119 S. Ct. 1604, 143 L. Ed. 2d 935 (1999). "
1302,26," The Court does not suggest that rejection of the Settlement Agreement is always warranted when the parties reach a 
compromise on claims of questionable merit. For example, under certain circumstances, approval may be warranted, where 
counsel agrees to accept fees substantially less than the lodestar or where the benefits to the defendants do not include a 
windfall for dismissal of later claims for future conduct. However, as discussed in this memorandum, the Settlement Agreement 
does not fall within these circumstances. Whether the parties can resurrect a settlement agreement addressing the court's 
concerns and satisfying the requirements of Rule 23(e) is not a matter as to which the court has a current opinion. "
1310,*," The Honorable Victoria A. Roberts, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Michigan, sitting by designation. "
1312,1," Where appropriate, Defendants SIA and SAM are referred to collectively as ""SIA/SAM"" throughout the opinion. The alleged 
conspiracy at issue is between SIA/SAM, collectively, and C&S Defendants. "
1313,2," Plaintiff actually argues that independently terminating Sancap would have been contrary to SIA/SAM's economic interest 
because SIA/SAM would have lost its major converter and distributor in the United States. However, C&S Defendants are sales 
agents, not converters or distributors. Thus, such an argument is irrelevant for assessing the economic wisdom of independently 
terminating Sancap without the complementary decision by C&S Defendants to offer their sales services to SIA/SAM. "
1314,3," Plaintiff contends that the ""Southern Region,"" which includes North Carolina, South Carolina. Alabama, Georgia, Florida, 
Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia, is the relevant geographic market for Section 1 analysis in this case. Because our review 
of an award of summary judgment for Defendants views evidence in a light most favorable to Plaintiff, we assume without 
deciding that the Southern Region is indeed the relevant geographic market in this case."
1314,4," Plaintiff cites testimony by Stuhlmiller in support of its claim that Sancap was the only distributor of SIA products in the 
Southern Region. However, the testimony cited by Plaintiff only discussed limitations on Sancap's ability to sell its own 
manufactured products."
1314,5," Plaintiff correctly notes that Connelly and Sikes each testified that SIA products generated approximately 80-90% of their 
annual sales, and that Hoeche testified that SIA products composed over one-third of Sancap's sales. However, when 
progressing to the C&S share of Sancap's sales of SIA products, Plaintiff's statistics become confused. Plaintiff contends, citing 
testimony of Sikes and Hoeche, that C&S ""sales of SIA products represented 80-90% of the total sales of SIA products by 
Sancap in the [Southern] Region."" Plaintiff's Reply Brief at 8. In fact, as noted above, Sikes testified that 85-90% of his sales 
were of SIA products, not that C&S accounted for 85-90% of Sancap's sales of SIA products. Simply, Plaintiff identifies no record 
support for its claim that most Sancap sales of SIA products in the Southern Region were in fact C&S sales. Thus, Plaintiff 
identifies no record support for its larger claim that any attempt by SIA/SAM to sell SIA products in the Southern Region, without 
C&S, would be contrary to its economic self-interest. "

1361,1," HN2[
] Generic drugs are ""versions of brand-name prescription drugs that are often sold without a brand name and that 
contain the same active ingredients, but not necessarily the same inactive ingredients, as the original."" United States v. Generix 
Drug Corp., 460 U.S. 453, 455, 75 L. Ed. 2d 198, 103 S. Ct. 1298 (1983). "
1362,2," Unless otherwise indicated, all paragraph references are to the complaint, and all factual allegations are drawn therefrom. "
1363,3," Generic drugs occupied more than 40 per cent of the prescription drug market in 1995, up from 19 per cent in 1983, before the 
passage of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. See Andrx, 2001 WL 855274, at *1 (citing Congressional Budget Office study). "
1364,4," The anti-competitive implications of the Watson-Halsey agreement are substantial. By forestalling the introduction of a generic 
drug even by several months, Watson was able to continue to reap the more substantial profits from its branded drug. The 
differential in profit between the branded and generic drugs presumably exceeded the cost of the Halsey buyout, thereby making 
that transaction an economically desirable one for Watson. Of course, consumers are left without a generic alternative to 
Monodox, which contributes to the significant cost of prescription drugs. Whether this arrangement causes antitrust injury to Eon, 
however, is an altogether separate question."
1364,5," HN9[
] The Supreme Court has been clear on this point: ""the central message of the Sherman Act is that a business entity 
must find new customers and higher profits through internal expansion--that is, by competing successfully rather than by 
arranging treaties with its competitors."" United States v. Citizens & Southern Nat'l Bank, 422 U.S. 86, 116, 45 L. Ed. 2d 41, 95 S. 
Ct. 2099 (1975)."
1364,6," Indeed, although we do not go so far as to agree with defendant's argument that the Watson-Halsey agreement had pro-
competitive effects, it is significant that had Eon's ANDA application followed that agreement more swiftly, it is possible that the 
agreement might have worked to Eon's benefit. That is, had Eon beat Watson to market, it would have been the first generic 
entrant because of the Watson buyout of its competitor. "
1365,7," We are cognizant that HN11[
] the Supreme Court has directed that an antitrust plaintiff ""should be given the full benefit of 
[its] proof without tightly compartmentalizing the various factual components and wiping the slate clean after scrutiny of each."" 
Continental Ore Co. v. Union Carbide & Carbon Corp., 370 U.S. 690, 699, 8 L. Ed. 2d 777, 82 S. Ct. 1404 (1962). However, the 
complaint itself notes that FDA regulations permit a generic drug and a pioneer branded drug to be made under the same NDA. 
(P19). Thus, Watson did not need Halsey's ANDA to market generic doxycycline. The Watson-Halsey agreement cannot 
logically be connected to the rush of the Watson generic to market, because the marketing of a generic could have been 
accomplished without the buyout. Consequently, these allegations stand logically distinct from those discussed in the previous 
section."
1365,8," This assumption almost certainly gives plaintiff's allegations a more expansive reading than even the permissive Rule 12(b)(6) 
standard requires. "
1366,9," As noted earlier, it is significant that because a generic drug entered the market later than it otherwise might have, consumer 
choice was curtailed. However, Eon does not have standing to recover based on that allegation."
1366,10," It is important to note that HN14[
] it is permissible for Watson to leverage, within limits, the benefits of the natural monopoly 
conferred by the exclusivity of the NDA for Monodox. See Twin Labs., Inc. v. Weider Health & Fitness, 900 F.2d 566, 568-69 (2d 
Cir. 1990). That is, simply because it was easier for Watson to enter the market for generic doxycycline, it does not ineluctably 
follow that the market entry was impermissible under the antitrust laws. Given that Eon was able to independently enter the 
market at the same time, a claim of ""monopoly leveraging"" against Watson is not sustainable. See id., at 570-71; AD/SAT v. 
Associated Press, 920 F. Supp. 1287, 1305-06 (S.D.N.Y. 1996) "
1367,11," HN17[
] Another important threshold question to an assessment of monopoly power is the definition of the ""relevant market"" 
that is alleged to be monopolized. Although this is often controverted and can even be a jury question, see Aspen Skiing Co. v. 
Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., 472 U.S. 585, 596, n.20, 86 L. Ed. 2d 467, 105 S. Ct. 2847 (1985), for the purposes of this 
motion to dismiss we will assume the relevant market as defined in the complaint. (PP 40-43). Plaintiff asserts that the product 
market consists of all doxycycline pharmaceutical products, and the relevant sub-market is generic doxycycline prescription 
drugs. We assume that plaintiff refers only to the market for doxycycline that is indicated for the treatment of adult acne and 
Lyme Disease."
1367,12," We are cognizant, of course, that plaintiff has not been afforded any discovery. However, HN18[
] the complaint must at 
least outline the contours of the monopolization claim. See Bustop Shelters, Inc. v. Convenience and Safety Corp., 521 F. Supp. 
989, 997 (S.D.N.Y. 1981) (""There is no suggestion of supporting facts, such as the size of the relevant product and geographic 
markets, the amount of competition foreclosed, and how the acts of the defendants affected that competition. Such conclusory 
allegations are insufficient in an antitrust complaint."") (granting motion to dismiss). "
1368,13," In this regard, plaintiff tries to argue contradictory and untenable positions: On the one hand, Eon maintains that Watson 
obtained inflated profits from its ""faux generic"". On the other hand, Eon also alleges predatory behavior, which typically involves 
a monopolist's underpricing of its product so as to drive out competition. Both violations cannot occur simultaneously, but neither 
are supported factually by the complaint. "
1369,14," Plaintiff also argues that the inaccurate product inserts are a violation of the Act and applicable FDA regulations. However, 
case law is clear on the point that HN21[
] no private right of action exists under the FDC Act. See, e.g., Braintree Labs., Inc. v. Nephro-Tech, Inc., 58 F. Supp. 2d 1293, 1295 n.1 (D. Kan. 1999) (Discussing dismissal of two counts and ""holding that both 
counts essentially alleged misbranding in violation of the Federal Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), 21 U.S.C. §§ 301-395, a 
statute under which no private right of action exists."")."
1369,15," Plaintiff's opposition papers to this motion argue that Watson's variable costs are a question for discovery, so that Eon may 
determine through investigation if the defendant marketed Monodox in a generic form below cost. However, the complaint does 
not contain that allegation. And, Eon's argument that this Court should adopt the standard for price discrimination articulated by 
the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, see Transamerica Computer Co. v. IBM Corp., 698 F.2d 1377, 1386-88 (9th Cir. 1983), which 
permits a claim even if a defendant's prices were above total cost, is unavailing in light of Second Circuit precedent. See Kelco 
Disposal, Inc. v. Browning-Ferris Indus. of Vt., 845 F.2d 404, 407-08 (2d Cir. 1988) (discussing predatory pricing in the context of 
a defendant's costs.). "
1370,16," We additionally note that plaintiff's claim does not allege the sort of injury contemplated by the Lanham Act. It is black-letter 
law that HN27[
] a prima facie Lanham Act claim requires ""that there is a likelihood of injury to the plaintiff in terms of declining 
sales, loss of good will, etc."" Warner-Lambert Co. v. Breathasure, 204 F.3d 87, 92 (3d Cir. 2000). The complaint is devoid of 
such allegations. "
1371,17," HN33[
] The standards for a claim under § 350 of the General Business Law and the Lanham Act are substantially the same, see Princeton Graphics Operating, L.P. v. NEC Home Electronics (U.S.A.), Inc., 732 F. Supp. 1258, 1266-67 (S.D.N.Y. 1990). 
Thus, our discussion of the Lanham Act claim applies here as well. "

1382,15, U.S.C. § 1012(b) (italics in the original). 
1383,4," It is not clear whether the enactment of the 1997 statutes was induced by any such complaints, for the Missouri legislature 
does not record debates or publish committee reports. See Roosevelt Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass'n v. Crider, 722 S.W.2d 325, 328 n. 
3 (Mo. Ct. App. 1986). Wenzel submitted affidavits from Missouri State Representative Timothy Harlan, the bill's sponsor, and "
1384,," George Oestreich, the chief executive officer of the Missouri Pharmacy Association and lobbyist for the Missouri statutes. See 
Appendix at 519, 526. Both testified that the statutes were intended to benefit enrollees by giving them the flexibility to fill 
maintenance prescriptions at retail pharmacies and to ""level the playing field"" for retail pharmacies who wished to fill such 
prescriptions. Neither affidavit conclusively demonstrates the legislature's intent, because Oestreich is not a legislator and post-
enactment statements of even a bill's sponsor are not entitled to much weight. See Western Air Lines, Inc. v. Bd. of Equalization 
of S. D., 480 U.S. 123, 130-31, 94 L. Ed. 2d 112, 107 S. Ct. 1038 n.* (1987); Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, 441 U.S. 281, 311, 60 L.

766, 100 S. Ct. 2051 (1980)."
1384,5," Appellants assert that the statutes were enacted to benefit retail pharmacies, but documents which they cite contain no 
comment on the legislature's intent. The cited press release and fiscal impact statement are not evidence of legislative intent 
because they were issued by the Missouri Department of Insurance, not a legislative body. See Mo. Rev. Stat. § 374.010 
(Department of Insurance is created by statute and has only enforcement powers). Similarly, the Missouri House of 
Representatives bill summaries are not statements of legislative intent, but are only summaries of the contents of the bill. See 
Missouri State Senate Glossary of Legislative Terms, at http//: www. senate. state. mo. us/glossary. htm (last visited August 1, 
2001)."
1384,6," Much of appellants' briefs are devoted to the argument that the Missouri statutes are like ""any willing provider"" laws which may 
not meet the three factor test. Such a law requires an HMO to allow any area provider willing to meet contract terms to be 
included in its network. See, e.g., National Park, 154 F.3d at 816. The category itself is not determinative, however. HN22[
] 
Whether a state law falls within the ERISA savings clause depends on the facts of the case, and several any willing provider 
laws have been found have to been saved. See, e.g., Nichols, 227 F.3d at 368-72; Texas Pharm.  Ass'n v. Prudential Ins. Co. of 
Am., 105 F.3d 1035, 1040-42 (5th Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 820, 139 L. Ed. 2d 34, 118 S. Ct. 75 (1997) (unamended

1394,1," This case initially began as a number of separate class actions from across the country that were then consolidated before this 
Court for pretrial proceedings by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation. Following the remand of a number of these cases 
for failure to satisfy the jurisdictional amount in controversy, 25 separate class actions plus Gray & Co. v. ADM, et. al., a tag-
along state case, remain before the Court."
1394,2," CPC International, Inc. (""CPC""), a named Defendant in this action, settled with the class early in the litigation. Roquette 
America, Inc., Golden Technologies Company, Inc., and Minnesota Corn Processors were also United States producers of 
HFCS during the conspiracy period but were not named as Defendants in this action."
1394,3," An oligopoly occurs when there is ""control or domination of a market by a few large sellers, creating high prices and low output 
similar to those found in a monopoly."" BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY 1115 (7th Ed. 1999). "
1395,4," Finishing capacity must be distinguished from grind capacity. Grind capacity is a measure of the amount of corn a mill can 
process into starch slurry, which then can be used to make several corn-derived products. A mill's finishing capacity is its ability 
to convert starch slurry into finished products, among which are HFCS 42 and HFCS 55."
1395,5," Lysine is an amino acid used to stimulate an animal's growth that can be added to animal feed during the manufacturing 
process."
1395,6," Although Cargill was initially named as a defendant in the citric acid conspiracy, summary judgment was entered in its favor on 
January 23, 1998. "
1398,7," Plaintiffs have suggested that this information could have been filtered through the monthly reporting of information that was 
sent through the CRA. As set forth more fully below, this assertion is not supported by the record, which reveals that only an 
independent accounting firm ever saw the individual data; Defendants received only aggregate data and could not have 
monitored each others' market shares with this information. Additionally, there were other non-Defendant members of the CRA 
whose information would also have been included in these aggregate figures."
1398,8," As set forth more fully below, the handful of transactions which Plaintiffs claim were to ""balance the deal"" would have been 
woefully inadequate and cannot readily be reconciled with the market share data. The inter-Defendant sales identified were not 
of sufficient magnitude to remedy the losses of market share suffered. "
1401,9," In some circuits, this additional evidence is referred to as a ""plus factor"". See Petruzzi's IGA v. Darling-Delaware, 998 F.2d 
1224, 1242-44 (3rd Cir. 1993); Todorov v. DCH Healthcare Authority, 921 F.2d 1438, 1456 (11th Cir. 1991). "
1402,10," It would appear from the factual recitation in these cases that there was also a qualitative difference in the circumstantial 
evidence presented. "
1403,11," During oral argument, the Court noted its concern that Plaintiffs appear to have ""cherry-picked"" a few transactions from the 
many transactions of record that they deem to be illustrative of their position."
1403,12," The record indicates, however, that Pepsi was able to obtain the HFCS 55 that Staley would have provided from its 
competitors, Cargill and American Maize. "
1406,13," Between 1987 and 1996, approximately 16% of ADM's HFCS 55 sales were made pursuant to tolling agreements, while tolling 
agreements represented more than 45% of Cargill's sales and 11.3% of Staley's sales. For HFCS 42, tolling agreements 
comprised 4.6% of ADM's sales, 9.6% of Cargill's sales, and 9.5% of Staley's sales."
1406,14," Plaintiffs respond with the assertion that negotiated transaction prices would likely have been even lower if the list prices, 
which were the starting point for negotiations, had been set in a competitive market. However, this assertion first assumes the 
existence of artificially-inflated prices as a result of a conspiracy that the Court finds has not been adequately proven in this case 
and is therefore non-probative. Even assuming the validity of the suggested correlation between list prices and transaction 
prices, all that is shown is another instance of parallelism. "
1408,15," Plaintiffs argue that after receiving the aggregate data back from the accountants, each company could produce further 
calculations that would reveal its own market share. However, this would still not allow the companies to know their co-
conspirators' individual information, and they would have no means of determining who was out of line and needed to either 
make a purchase or sell product to ""balance the deal."" "
1411,16, It is undisputed that no Defendant held an ownership interest in Cargill or CPC. 
1415,17," Cwt. is the abbreviation for hundredweight, which is equivalent to 100 pounds. "
1416,18," Cargill spent a substantial sum of money in order to construct and open a new corn wet milling plant in Blair, Nebraska, in 
1995. It would seem nonsensical for Cargill to have undertaken such a great expenditure if it had agreed not exceed a specific 
market share that was not increasing as fast as the producers' expanding capacities. "
1417,19," However, as it is undisputed that Defendants received only aggregate data from the CRA, this particular suggestion is not 
probative of the point asserted and is entitled to little, if any, weight. "
1419,20," In this section, Plaintiffs also surmise that the various attempts by larger Defendants to explore either acquisition or joint 
ventures with smaller Defendants provided opportunities for the exchange of confidential information, which was discussed 
above as purported conduct evidence. Id. at 71-72."
1419,21," Specifically, the Jacoby index was 4.39% for ADM, 5.13% for Cargill, 5.7% for CPC, 6.11% for American Maize, and 8.29% for 
Staley. After considering the much-touted inter-Defendant purchases, the values were still only 4.39% for ADM, 5.36% for 
Cargill, 5.68% for CPC, 6.10% for American Maize, and 6.84% for Staley. "
1423,1," The defendant argued in its memorandum that the named plaintiffs' claims are not typical of those of the class because they 
allege they purchased computers with pre-installed Windows 95 or 98 and not that they acquired any full packaged product 
Microsoft operating systems or any of the other Microsoft operating systems covered by the class definition. See M.R. Civ. P. 
23(a)(3); Def's Mem. in Opp. at 36-37. During argument, the defendant stated that it challenged only whether the named 
plaintiffs would be adequate representatives. Transcript of 5/15/01 Hearing at 6. The named plaintiffs' allegations with regard to 
purchases are sufficient at this stage of the litigation to satisfy the requirements of Rule 23(a)(3). See Pls.' Amended Complaint, 
¶¶ 7-9; M.R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3); Karofsky v. Abbott Labs., Inc., CV-95-1009, 1997 Me. Super. LEXIS 316, *26-27, *32 & n.23 (Me. 
Super. Ct., Cum. Cty. Oct. 15, 1997) [*4] (Saufley, J.)."
1423,2," The plaintiffs argue that ""Microsoft distorts the testimony by asserting that Mr. Blomquist disclaimed any damages in this action. 
In fact, Mr. Blomquist said that he was not sure what remedy the court would order if this suit were successful."" Pls.' Reply Mem. 
at 25 (citation and footnote omitted). Plaintiff Blomquist testified that it would be ''for the court to determine"" what the result would 
be if the lawsuit were successful and that ""I do not believe I was overcharged."" Blomquist Dep. at 81."
1423,3, His disqualification would not otherwise defeat certification. 
1425,4," The plaintiffs' request for certification under Rule 23(b)(2) was not the primary focus of the plaintiffs' argument at hearing. See 
Transcript of 5/15/01 Hearing at 16-21. "
1426,5," The predominance requirement is a stumbling block in indirect purchaser actions. See Sugai Prods., Inc. v. Kona Kai Farms, 
Inc., No. 97-00043.SPK, 1997 WL 824022, at *13 (D. Haw. Nov. 19, 1997). In Peridot, Inc. v. Kimberly-Clark Corp., indirect purchasers sought class certification. The court determined that impact could be 
established by use of a mechanical calculation using common proof in indirect purchaser cases. Peridot, Inc. v. Kimberly-Clark 
Corp., No. MC 98-012686, 2000 WL 673933, at *3 (Minn. Dist. Ct. Feb. 7, 2000) The court concluded, however, that the 
plaintiffs' expert did not provide a viable means of calculating the quantity of damages for the class as a whole because the 
expert had not devised a method of regression analysis or markup analysis to compute the price increases passed through to 
the putative class. The expert admitted that he was not aware of anyone else devising such a model and that he was not sure 
how or whether he could  [*14] control for nonconspiratorial factors to produce an accurate model. The class was not certified. 
Id. at *4. In Execu-Tech Bus. Sys., Inc. v. Appleton Papers, Inc., the class of indirect purchasers of thermal fax paper was not certified 
because the plaintiffs could not show proof of impact. Execu-Tech Bus. Sys., Inc. v. Appleton Papers, Inc., 743 So.2d 19, 20 
(Fla. Dist. Ct. App, 1999) (per curiam), aff'g No. 96-9639 CACE 05 (Fla. Cir. Ct. Dec. 16, 1997). The plaintiffs' expert relied on 
""incidence analysis"" and said that that method was generally accepted in the field of economics. He agreed that the method had 
not been used before, that assumptions had to be made in order for the analysis to work, and that the existence of variability in 
the amount of pass through throughout the distribution chain during the class period precluded proving impact and damages in 
common. Id. at 21. In Derzon v. Appleton Papers, Inc., a proposed class of indirect purchasers of fax paper was not certified in a case brought 
under Wisconsin's antitrust and deceptive trade practices acts. Derzon v. Appleton Papers, Inc., No. 96-CV-3678, 1998 WL 
1031504, at *1 (Wis. Cir. Ct. July 7, 1998). Plaintiff had represented  [*15] that by means of incidence analysis and regression 
analysis, an expert would prove damages by common evidence. Id. at *7. In Ashley v. Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., plaintiffs were indirect purchasers of an agricultural feed supplement and sued the 
producers and distributors for price fixing under Alabama law. Ashley v. Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., No. CV-95-336-R, at 2 
(Ala. Cir. Ct. Mar. 13, 1998). The class was not certified based on the court's concerns regarding the plaintiff's expert's 
methodology for proving impact and damages. The court concluded that plaintiff sought certification on the ""strength of its 
statistical model. The Plaintiff clearly rejects any present need, or future intention, of proving the claims in this case by any 
means other than generalized evidence."" Id. at 34. In Wilcox v. Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., plaintiff sought to certify a class of all people in Michigan who used food products 
containing high fructose com syrup. Wilcox v. Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., No 96-82473-CP, at 1-2 (Mich. Cir. Ct. Sept. 29, 
1997). Certification was denied. In discussing the difficulty in proving damages, the court stated that the purpose of the litigation 
was to compensate people  [*16] damaged by the alleged illegal activities and not ""just to fix some punishment for antitrust 
violations."" Id. at 7. In Wood v. Abbott Labs., Inc., plaintiff's request to certify a class of indirect purchasers of brand-name prescription drugs was 
denied. The court noted that the plaintiff's expert, who was the plaintiffs' expert in Karofsky, proposed theories that did not 
provide a method for calculating each class member's individual damages, as required by Michigan law. Wood v. Abbott Labs., 
Inc., No. 96-512561-CZ, 1997 WL 824019, at *2 (Mich. Cir. Ct. Sept. 11, 1997). In Kerr v. Abbott Labs., Inc., another indirect purchaser action in Minnesota, the court determined that individual issues would 
predominate because a showing of consumer impact would require an examination of myriad transactions at many levels of 
distribution to determine dates of purchase, prices, terms of any rebates, or discounts. The only common question was whether 
an antitrust violation occurred. Kerr v. Abbott Labs., Inc., No. 96-002837, 1997 WL 314419, at *2 (Minn. Dist. Ct. Feb. 19, 1997). In Durden v. Abbott Labs., Inc., plaintiffs requested certification of a class of indirect purchasers of infant formula.  [*17] The 
court found the testimony of the defendants' expert more credible than that of the plaintiffs' expert regarding a pass on of 
overcharges. Durden v. Abbott Labs., Inc., No. CV-93-663, at 5-6 (Ala. Cir. Ct. Jan. 16, 1996). The defendants' expert reviewed 
extensive empirical evidence on the issue. The plaintiffs' expert ""theorized that 100% of all manufacturer overcharges are "
1427,," passed on by all retailers (thereby injuring all consumers), and that both the fact of injury and damages can accordingly be 
determined on a classwide basis."" Id. at 6. In Harbin v. Johnson & Johnson Vision Prods., Inc., certification of a state-wide class of indirect purchasers of defendants' 
contact lenses was denied. Harbin v. Johnson & Johnson Vision Prods., Inc., No. CV-94-002872, at 3 (Ala. Cir. Ct. Sept. 12, 
1995). The court, after a one-day evidentiary hearing, determined that individual questions of fact predominated over common 
questions because to establish fact of injury, ""each and every purchaser of defendants' contact lenses have to be questioned to 
ascertain that he or she had (a) purchased contact lenses from an Alabamian ECP or retail optical chain, (b) during the 
applicable time, (c) in some  [*18] certain amount, and (d) at a certain price."" Id. at 3. In Holmes v. Abbott Labs., Inc., the court denied, without written comment, certification of the proposed class because questions 
of law or fact common to the class members did not predominate over questions affecting individual members. Holmes v. Abbott 
Labs., Inc., No. 94-744, at 1 (Mich. Cir. Ct. July 10, 1995). McCarter v. Abbot Labs., Inc. involved an unsuccessful effort to certify indirect purchasers of infant formula products under 
Alabama law. McCarter v. Abbott Labs., Inc., No CV 91-050, at 2 (Ala. Cir. Ct. April 9, 1993). The court concluded that the 
plaintiffs could not show proof of impact and noted that the evidence revealed very little correlation between wholesale and retail 
pricing. Id. at 7. In City of St. Paul v. FMC Corp., a proposed class of municipal indirect purchasers of chlorine and caustic soda products was 
not certified. City of St. Paul v. FMC Corp., No. 3-89-0466, 1990 WL 259683, at *1 (D. Minn. Nov. 14, 1990). The court 
concluded that value added to the product at various points in the chain of distribution precluded proof of the fact of damage 
element. Id. at **2-3. In Keating v. Philip Morris, Inc., a  [*19] proposed class of cigarette purchasers sued cigarette manufacturers for price fixing 
under state antitrust law. Keating v. Philip Morris, Inc., 417 N.W.2d 132, 134 (Minn. Ct. App. 1987). The class was not certified 
based on, among other things, the lack of any formula to calculate damages. Id. In Borden, Inc. v. Universal Indus. Corp., indirect purchasers of refined sugar were proposed as a class under Mississippi's 
antitrust laws. Borden, Inc. v. Universal Indus. Corp., 88 F.R.D. 708, 709 (N.D. Miss. 1981). The court concluded that 
""[d]etermination of damages would likely require years of proof regarding the effect of a conspiracy between Borden and other 
sugar companies on the various levels of distribution."" Id. at 710; see also Pischenich v. Abbott Lab., Inc., No. MC 94-6868 
(Minn. Dist. Ct. May 26, 1995) (class certification denied without comment). "

1428,7," The enactment of section 1104 does not change the plaintiffs' burden of proof on a motion for class certification. See Pls.'

see also Peridot, 2000 WL 673933, at *2 (no special allowance for indirect purchaser suits to be brought as class actions; suits 
still must meet all requirements for class certification specified in Minnesota Rules of Civil Procedure); contra Gordon v. 
Microsoft Corp., No. 00-5994, 2001 WL 366432, at *4 (Minn. Dist. Ct. Mar. 30, 2001). "
1429,8," Any suggestion by the plaintiffs that discovery was inadequate comes too late. See Pls. Attorneys' Letters dated 5/23/01 & 
6/7/01. No request was filed to extend discovery on the certification issue. "
1430,9," The plaintiffs' motion for class certification, memorandum, and supporting documents were filed on 8/16/00. Dr. Leffler was first 
asked to prepare an affidavit for the Maine action in late October or November, 2000. See Leffler Dep. at 124."
1430,10," In its surreply, the defendant argues that the Leffler affidavit is inadmissible pursuant to M.R. Evid. 401 and 702. Def's Surreply 
at 3-6. His statements in his affidavit are relevant to the issue of whether the plaintiffs can show methodologies to prove fact of 
injury and damages. Whether his statements are helpful is discussed in this decision. See infra pp. 26-33."
1430,11," The plaintiffs' expert  [*31] concluded that Microsoft's activity with regard to browsers is not relevant. See Leffler Aff. ¶ 5(e); 
infra note 16."
1430,12, Dr. Leffler concludes that details of supply and demand are not necessary. See infra p. 29. 
1431,13, See supra note 7. 
1432,14, See infra p. 31.
1432,15, See supra pp. 6-7. 
1433,16," Judge Jackson's decision includes 412 paragraphs of findings. See United States v. Microsoft Corp., 84 F. Supp. 2d 9 (D.D.C. 
1999); see also United States v. Microsoft Corp., 87 F. Supp. 2d 30 (D.D.C. 2000). The plaintiffs cite the cases three times, 
generally for the proposition that Microsoft enjoyed monopoly power. See Pls.' Mem. at 7, 21-22; Pls.' Reply Mem. at 10. 
Plaintiffs state, with no supporting authority, that ""Judge Jackson's findings are not limited to particular consumers or distribution 
channels. They apply to all consumers, regardless of how and from whom they purchased."" Pls. Reply Mem. at 10."
1433,17," The fact that a defendant has engaged in illegal conduct is only one of several elements of class action certification. For 
example, in Dry Cleaning & Laundry Institute of Detroit, Inc. v. Flom's Corp., the plaintiffs were direct purchasers of dry cleaning 
products and brought their antitrust allegations pursuant to the Sherman Act. Notwithstanding that the defendants had pleaded 
guilty in a separate criminal action with regard to price fixing, the court declined to certify the class pursuant to 23(b)(3). Dry 
 [*43] Cleaning & Laundry Inst. of Detroit, Inc. v. Flom's Corp., No. 91-CV-76072-DT, 1993 WL 527928, at *1 (E.D. Mich. Oct. 
19, 1993). The court concluded that the plaintiffs' expert's methodologies were inadequate because they did not establish a 
structure to the prices in the industry and failed to take into account varying markets, sales at deviated prices as a result of 
discounts, and customer differences between different geographical areas. Id. at *4. The court distinguished In re Domestic Air 
Transportation Antitrust Litigation because in that case, the plaintiffs' expert had gone beyond merely identifying prospective 
methodologies regarding damages, Id. at *6. "
1434,18," Dr. Leffler concluded that ""Microsoft's monopolization activities concerning its Internet Explorer Web Browser are not of 
relevance in assessing injury to class members from Microsoft's monopolization of operating systems during the class period."" 
Leffler Aff. ¶ 5(e)."
1434,19," As discussed, the Leffler affidavit was filed with the plaintiffs' reply brief. The class certification stage is not an occasion for a 
battle of the experts. See Caridad v. Metro North Commuter R.R., 191 F.3d 283, 292 (2d Cir. 1999). Instead, at this stage, the 
plaintiffs are required to make a threshold showing that the antitrust activity had a common impact on members of the class. See 
In re Cardizem CD Antitrust Litig., 200 F.R.D. 297, 321 (E.D. Mich. 2001). The defendant has no burden. Contra Pls.' Reply 
Mem. at 11 (""Microsoft's Experts Do Not Succeed in Proving at this Early Stage That No Possible Method Is Available to Show 
Classwide Antitrust Injury""); Pls.' Reply Mem. at 15 n.13 (""Microsoft has made no such showing here.""); Leffler Aff. ¶ 5(c) 
 [*45] (""Professor Hausman's analysis offers no evidence to the contrary.""). "
1436,20, See supra p. 19.
1436,21," Clearly, an examination of the demand curve  [*52] of each firm between Microsoft and the end-user would preclude 
certification. See Second Hausman Aff. ¶ 9. "
1437,22," For example, Dr. Leffler assumes that Maine ""consumers do not have access to close substitutes to Microsoft's operating 
systems."" Leffler Aff. ¶ 9. Dr. Leffler does, however, criticize Microsoft's experts, Dr. Hausman and Professor Meehan, for not 
providing enough information regarding Maine consumers. Id. ¶ 15 n.21."
1437,23," To the extent that Dr. Leffler has relied on any data,  [*55] the defendant argues that those facts are not relevant to this case. 
See Def's Surreply at 3-4; Pls.' Amended Complaint, ¶¶ 26-31; Leffler Dep. at 147-48."
1437,24, See supra note 19.
1437,25," Except for the response to the materials filed by Microsoft, the materials on which the plaintiffs rely, including the proposed 
methodologies in the Leffler affidavit, could have been filed with the plaintiffs' complaint in December, 1999. Nothing in the 
materials appears to have been obtained during discovery on the certification issue. Nothing is specific to this case or to Maine 
indirect purchasers. "
1438,26," See Derzon, 1998 WL 1031504, *7 (""Plaintiff suggests that at this stage the court must not consider the merits of plaintiff's 
methodology, but the viability of the proposed methodology. Whether or not this rather exquisite distinction is helpful, plaintiff is 
correct that he need not prove his case at this point. He does, however, bear the burden of establishing that he possesses 
 [*57] the means to prove it."")."

supported by adequate consideration, is without merit. Even if the changes to the commission schedule were not part of the 
original Agreement, as GDS contends, GDS continued performing under the contract and did not exercise its right to terminate it 
See Section 17(A) of the Agreement, allowing GDS to terminate the Agreement. As a matter of law, GDS' forbearance from 
exercising its right to terminate the Agreement constitutes consideration for each of the revised commission schedules. See 
Docket Entry 51, at 10 (and case authorities cited therein). In a case strikingly similar to the one at hand, involving a dispute 
between a salesman and his employer over the employer's unilateral revision to commission rates, the Texas Supreme Court 
held that in such an situation, the person complaining of the modification must make an election: the employee must either (a) 
accept the new terms, or (b) quit and sue for damages, but he cannot do both. Hathaway, 711 S.W.2d at 229."

1459,168," See Thomas v. Arn, 474 U.S. 140, 149-152, 106 S. Ct. 466, 88 L. Ed. 2d 435 (1985)."
1459,169," Douglass v. United Servs. Auto. Ass'n, 79 F.3d 1415, 1428-29 (5th Cir. 1996). "
1474,1," Linerboard includes any grade of paperboard suitable for use in the production of corrugated sheets, which are in turn used in 
the manufacture of corrugated boxes and for a variety of industrial and commercial applications. Corrugated sheets are made by 
gluing a fluted sheet which is not made of linerboard, known as the corrugating medium, between facing sheets of linerboard; 
corrugated sheets are also referred to as containerboard. The defendants named in the instant lawsuits are major integrated 
manufacturers and sellers of linerboard, corrugated sheets, and corrugated boxes. "
1475,2," Tenneco, Inc. is the sole Non-Stone Defendant that was not named as a party in this complaint."
1475,3," One of the defendants named in both the Corrugated Box Amended Complaint and Sheets Complaint II, Simpson Tacoma 
Kraft Co., was dismissed by agreement of all plaintiffs on November 8, 1999. See Stipulation of Dismissal in MDL No. 1261 
(Doc. 43, filed Nov. 8, 1999). Thus, eleven Non-Stone defendants remain as parties to the Corrugated Box Amended Complaint, 
and ten Non-Stone defendants remain as parties to Sheets Complaint II."
1475,4," At the time of oral argument, Oak Valley Farms, Inc. (""Oak Valley""), Local Baking Products, Inc. (""Local Baking""), and Garrett 
Paper, Inc. (""Garrett Paper"") remained as Box Plaintiffs."
1475,5," At the time of oral argument, General Refractories Co. (""General Refractories"") and Albert O. Halper Corrugated Box Co. 
(""Halper"") remained as Sheet Plaintiffs. "
1476,6," The Court notes that the Corrugated Box Amended Complaint, Sheets Complaint I, and Sheets Complaint II contain 
substantially similar allegations. For completeness, citations will be to all Complaints, where appropriate."
1476,7, Defendants concede that the downtime was taken at mills producing linerboard. 
1480,8," Insofar as this argument relates to the typicality of plaintiffs' claims, the defendants' arguments are not persuasive. The fact that the purchases were not made from all of the defendants, or that all of the methods through which the 
conspiracy was allegedly effected were not utilized against the named plaintiffs is not dispositive of their ability to represent 
the class. Nor will differing damages, resulting from varied methods of procuring and purchasing the product, defeat 
satisfaction of Rule 23(a)(3) In re Potash Antitrust Litig., 159 F.R.D. 682, 691 (D. Minn 1993) (quoting In re Workers' Compensation, 130 F.R.D. 99, 106 (D. 
Minn. 1990)) (internal citations and quotations omitted). "
1481,9," Plaintiffs submitted a computer printout showing Oak Valley made multiple purchases from Stone between October 1, 1993 
and February 28, 1994, the first five months of the proposed class period. Ex. Q, attached to Box Plaintiffs' Reply Memorandum 
in Support of Class Certification (Doc. 90)."
1481,10," Defendants submitted a chart which shows that Garrett Paper purchased $ 25,085 worth of boxes from Stone between 
October 1, 1993 and December 31, 1993, $ 67,248 worth of boxes from Stone in 1994, and $ 20,397 worth of boxes from Stone 
from January 1, 1995 to November 30, 1995. Fisher Aff. Ex 6. This evidence runs counter to defendants' contentions concerning 
the timing of Garrett Paper's purchases. "
1483,11," At oral argument, the issue of whether some contracts had, as a term, the price of the products tied to something which could 
not have been affected by the alleged conspiracy was discussed in connection with the predominance prong of Rule 23(b)(3). 
The Court will address this argument, infra, in § IV.B.1.d."
1483,12," Timing of purchases was addressed supra, in § IV.A.4.b. "
1489,13," To the extent that this discussion involves a battle of experts, it not appropriate for the Court to determine which expert is more 
credible at this time. In In re Visa Check/Mastermoney Antitrust Litigation, 192 F.R.D. 68 (E.D.N.Y. 2000), the court, in ruling 
upon a motion to strike an expert report, expounded upon the role of a Daubert-type inquiry at the class certification stage. See 
id. at 76. It held that HN33[
] an expert opinion ""is admissible for the narrow purpose for which it is offered: to support the 
plaintiffs' class certification motion."" Id. at 77. To preclude such evidence at the class certification stage, it must be shown that 
the ""opinion is the kind of 'junk science' that a Daubert inquiry at this preliminary stage ought to screen."" Id. (citing Iacobelli 
Constr., Inc. v. County of Monroe, 32 F.3d 19, 25 (2d Cir. 1994)). No limiting motions were filed in the present case although the parties have raised questions about the opposing experts. On the 
present state of the record, the Court, where appropriate, will use plaintiffs' experts' reports to support the allegations contained 
in plaintiffs' class certification motions. "
1490,14," These models can also be used to show a method for calculating the damages, the amount of the overcharge. "
1491,15," The exception being those purchasers whose contracts were tied to a factor independent of the price of linerboard. Those 
purchasers will be excluded from the classes. See, infra, § IV.B.1.d."
1491,16," In light of the conflicting expert evidence presented, and the detailed arguments of the parties, the Court is of the belief that 
such arguments go to the weight of the testimony and must be resolved by the finder of fact. "
1493,17," The chart notes that ""Weeks of supply is obtained by dividing inventories by the weekly consumption in box plants for the 
current month, excluding weekends and holidays."" "
1500,1," A more detailed factual background can be found in the Honorable David N. Edelstein's opinion denying the defendants' motion 
to dismiss. See Six West Retail Acquisition, Inc. v. Sony Theatre Management Corp., 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2604, No. 97 Civ. 
5499, 2000 WL 264295, at *1-11 (S.D.N.Y. March 9, 2000)."
1500,2," The various relationships among the corporate defendants are outlined thoroughly in the Amended Complaint. The defendants 
have generally denied almost all of the allegations, including those pertaining to their corporate structure. However, they have 
not set forth any alternative facts. Accordingly, the Amended Complaint will serve as the basis for information on corporate 
organization of the defendants."
1500,3," Hereinafter, the term ""Sony,"" unless specifically modified, will include Sony Theatres, Sony Pictures, and Sony USA, as well as 
Loews Theatres, Loews Fine Arts, and TBA. "
1501,4," According to the plaintiff, the parties exchanged drafts of a written management agreement, but no final version was ever 
signed. Nevertheless, the plaintiff asserts that Six West and Sony effectively acted pursuant to two letter agreements -- a 
proposal contained in Mr. Solow's letter of October 1, 1993, and another proposal offered by Loews Fine Arts in its letter dated 
May 18, 1994. (Amended Compl. P 44; Fleishman Aff., Exhs. C, D)."
1501,5, The Amended Complaint provides no details about a management agreement regarding this theatre. 
1503,6," Subsequent to the merger, Mr. Ruisi became President and CEO of Loews Cineplex Entertainment. (Green Decl., Exh. 17 at 
7)."
1503,7," The plaintiff contends that the following statement, excerpted from Mr. Reid's August 15, 1996 letter to Mr. Solow, amounts to 
such an admission: ""As I have previously explained to you, the East Side has become the most competitive zone in Manhattan, 
with 25 screens operated by four different exhibitors. It is therefore necessary to form relationships in order to be booked 
properly on a long term basis. Our relationships on the East Side are with Paramount, Warner Brothers, and Gramercy."" (Green 
Decl., Exh. 39 at 1; Memorandum in Support of Plaintiff's Motion to Compel the Depositions (""Pl. Memo."") at 14-15 (emphasis in 
Pl. Memo.)). "
1504,8," In one of the reports apparently generated in response to Mr. Kawai's inquiry, Barrie Lawson Loakes writes to Mr. Ruisi that he 
is ""very sorry that . . . Mr. Idei had to be bothered by Sheldon [Solow]."" (Green Decl., Exh. 40 at FF 006098)."
1504,9," The plaintiffs quote this passage from another of Mr. Reid's letters to Mr. Solow: ""The East Side of New York is a highly 
competitive and important zone consisting of 25 screens operated by four different exhibitors. In order for distributors to be 
certain of proper placement in this zone they make long term relationships with one or two of these exhibitors who agree to 
participate in the liquidation of all of their product, not just high profile films like 'Emma' . . . . With our three screens on the East 
Side of New York, we primarily play films from Paramount, Warner Brothers, and Gramercy Pictures."" (Green Decl., Exh. 40 at 
FF 006102; Pl. Memo. at 15 (emphasis in Pl. Memo.))."
1504,10," HN5[
] Rule 30(b)(6) provides, in relevant part, that ""the organization . . . named [as a deponent] shall designate one or more officers, directors, or managing agents, or other persons who consent to testify on its behalf, and may set forth, for each person 
designated, the matters on which the person will testify."" "
1506,11," The plaintiff cites as an example a letter from Yuki Nozoe, an SPE executive, in which he requests that SRE, Sony's movie 
exhibition affiliate, should be required to accept ""firm-term"" pricing. (Green Decl., Exh. 30 at SC05178-79). In a handwritten note 
on the letter, Mr. Nozoe apparently asks that Mr. Stringer not be the official making the ultimate decision on this issue. (Green 
Decl., Exh. 30 at SC05175, SC05179). A different note indicates that Mr. Stringer participated in a subsequent discussion about 
resolving this conflict. (Green Decl., Exh. 30 at SC05173, SC05177)."
1506,12," In November of 1997, Mr. Stringer fielded memoranda from Robert Wiesenthal of Credit Suisse First Boston and Nick Henny, 
SCA's Chief Financial Officer, advising him not to appoint SPE executives to LCE's board of directors. Both Mr. Wiesenthal and 
Mr. Henny were concerned with the potential for a conflict of interest at the board meeting when ""firm-term"" pricing would be 
discussed. (Green Decl., Exhs. 47, 49). Nonetheless, Mr. Stringer recommended that two SPE executives and another executive 
with an SPE affiliate be appointed to the LCE board (Green Decl., Exh. 37 at SC01528), and Sony appears to have followed his 
advice. (Green Decl., Exh. 2)."
1506,13," In a letter dated March 2, 2001, Sony's counsel had already offered to make Mr. Kawai available for deposition ""for one day,"" 
and ""without prejudice to [the] position that none of the depositions are proper."" (Green Decl., Exh. 5)."
1506,14," In late 1996 and early 1997, Mr. Kawai received a number of reports related to the management of SRE, Loews' parent 
company. (Green Decl., Exhs. 28, 42, 43, 45, 46). On February, 14, 1997, he, in turn, wrote a memorandum to senior officials at 
Sony Corporation making proposals on (1) SRE's structure after the Loews-Cineplex merger, and (2) the future of Lincoln 
Square Theatre, Sony's premier movie theater in Manhattan. (Green Decl., Exh. 44)."
1506,15, Mr. Idei was also present at this meeting. 
1507,16," The defendants point to a ruling by the Honorable Edward J. Greenfield, a Justice of the New York Supreme Court, in which 
he observed that Mr. Solow is ""one of the most litigious parties in our court."" (Opinion filed December 31, 1998, attached as Exh. 
A to Declaration of Manvin S. Mayell dated June 14, 2001 (""Mayell Decl.""), at 3-4; see also Opinion dated May 25, 2000, 
attached as Exh. B to Mayell Decl., at 8-10 (imposing sanctions on Mr. Solow for personal involvement in frivolous litigation 
conduct); Solow v. Stone, 163 F.3d 151 (2d Cir. 1998)(per curiam); Solow v. BMW (US) Holding Corp., 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
16059, No. 97 Civ. 1373, 1998 WL 717613 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 14, 1998))."
1507,17," The plaintiff places great deal of emphasis on its argument that requiring depositions to take place in Japan will delay 
discovery by as much as six months. (Pl. Memo. at 22-23; Green Decl., Exh. 54 at 4 (Department of State circular indicating that "
1508,," ""the American Embassy in Tokyo is generally booked six months in advance.""). Yet, attempting to fit these depositions into a 
busy executive's business trips to New York is equally likely to cause a lengthy delay. "
1515,1, I conclude that the fax is not inadmissible hearsay when offered to prove Tucker's state of mind prior to making the job offer. 
1517,2," Plus $ 3,000 for shipping costs."
1517,3," The rest of the definition, concerning the District of Columbia and territories and possessions of the United States, is not 
implicated here. "
1519,4," Rotec also alleges that Tucker violated the Travel Act with the same predicate acts but agreed at oral argument that an 
analysis under the Travel Act adds nothing. Thus, I will not consider that statute "
1533,1," The basic allegations of plaintiff's complaint cam be gleaned from the court's previous opinion. Williams Elec. Games, Inc. v. 
Barry, 42 F. Supp. 2d 785 (N.D. Ill. 1999) (""Williams I""). Familiarity with the facts and the players is assumed. "
1535,2," As noted in the section of this opinion discussing plaintiff's price fixing claim, the evidence of agreement between Garrity and 
Milgray (Slupik and/or Lawrence Gnat) was insufficient to meet plaintiff's burden under § 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act, 15 
U.S.C. § 1, of tending to exclude the possibility of independent action by the defendants. Coupled with the evidence of Barry's 
association with Garrity, the evidence is sufficient to create an issue of fact as to whether an enterprise existed, absent the 
heightened standard required under § 1. "
1536,3," HN8[
]  15 U.S.C. § 1 provides in pertinent part: Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among 
several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal. "
1537,4," The court will assume for purposes of this motion that Barry so testified. Plaintiffs' record citation does not support the 
statement, and Gnat denied discussing Barry with Garrity. "
1539,5," Because the court has concluded that there is insufficient evidence of conspiracy to survive summary judgment, there is no 
need to address defendants' second argument regarding cognizable antitrust injury. "
1540,6," Lawrence Gnat bought out both Slupik and Sylwestrzak sometime in 1987, either immediately before or immediately after 
Gnat's meeting with Milgray in New York. "
1543,7," Because Arrow has taken the lead on these arguments, the court will refer to the defenses brought by Arrow in its discussion. "
1544,8," The parties appear to agree that the relevant limitation periods for plaintiff's state and federal claims range from three to five 
years. "
1579,1," The Complaint alleges that, at all times, Shapiro acted for his two firms, defendants Shapiro & Olander and Shapiro 
Negotiations Institute. This Opinion refers to Shapiro and his firms collectively as Shapiro."
1579,2," HN1[
] Section 301(a) provides that ""suits for violation of contracts between an employer and a labor organization 
representing employees in an industry affecting commerce . . . may be brought in any District Court of the United States having 
jurisdiction over the parties"". 29 U.S.C. § 185(a). In addition to conferring jurisdiction on federal courts, HN2[
] § 301 authorizes federal courts to fashion a body of federal law for the enforcement of collective bargaining agreements. Beidleman v. Stroh 
Brewery Co., 182 F.3d 225, 231-32 (3d Cir. 1999). Because of the need for uniform interpretation of agreements governed by § 
301, § 301 completely preempts state law claims for violation of these agreements. Id."
1579,3," The plaintiffs filed Preliminary Objections to those Preliminary Objections, arguing that the Preliminary Objections were 
untimely. The court has overruled plaintiffs' Preliminary Objections to the Preliminary Objections by separate Order. "
1580,4," A second NLRA preemption doctrine, the Machinists doctrine, bars state law regulations and claims concerning conduct that 
Congress intended to be left unregulated and to remain as part of the self-help remedies left to the combatants in labor disputes. 
Local 76, Int'l Ass'n of Machinists and Aerospace Workers v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Comm'n, 427 U.S. 132, 147-148, 
49 L. Ed. 2d 396, 96 S. Ct. 2548 (1976). The Machinists doctrine is not applicable here. "
1581,5," The Complaint is full of allegations of unfair labor practices and violations of the umpires' collective bargaining agreement. 
These allegations are not relevant to the plaintiffs' state law claims."
1581,6," The defendants cite two decisions where claims against third party defendants were preempted by the NLRA. Lumber 
Production Indus. Workers v. West Coast Indus. Rel'ns Ass'n, 775 F.2d 1042, 1048-49 (9th Cir. 1985); Richardson v. Kruchko & 
Fries, 966 F.2d 153, 156-57 (4th Cir. 1992)."
1581,7," HN8[
] The relationship between a lawyer and his client is a serious, vital and solemn one. No third person may interfere with 
the relationship any more than he may with propriety intervene between a doctor and his patient. A claimant or patient may, of 
course, disengage himself from a professional relationship provided he has met all obligations owing to his legal or medical 
counsellor, but if that disassociation is the result of coercion or misrepresentation practiced by others, the intervenors are 
answerable in law as anyone else would be liable for causing the rupture of a binding contract. Richette v. Solomon, 410 Pa. 6, 187 A.2d 910, 912 (1963)."
1581,8," HN9[
] The NLRA does not preempt defamation claims arising from labor disputes if the plaintiff shows that the defendant 
made the statements ""with knowledge of their falsity or with reckless disregard of whether they were false"" and that the 
statements actually injured him. Linn v. United Plant Guard Workers of Am., Local 114, 383 U.S. 53, 65-66, 15 L. Ed. 2d 582, 86 
S. Ct. 657 (1966) (adopting standard for defamation of public figures of New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 11 L. Ed. 
2d 686, 84 S. Ct. 710 (1964)). See also Meyer v. Joint Council 53 Int'l Brotherhood of Teamsters, 416 Pa. 401, 206 A.2d 382, 
389 (1965) (holding that Garmon does not preempt libel claims). The purpose of this higher burden for defamation claims is to 
guard against abuse of libel actions in labor disputes and to prevent such actions from intruding upon the free debate that the 
NLRA envisions. Linn, 383 U.S. at 65. This court need not decide if the more stringent standard applies to claims by persons like 
the plaintiffs who are third parties not subject to the NLRA. If it does apply, the plaintiffs have satisfied it. They allege that the 
defendants made their defamatory statements ""with malice, with specific knowledge of the falsity of the statements and with 
reckless disregard for the truth of their statements"" and that the statements caused actual damage. Complaint PP 115-16, 128. "
1582,9," HN11[
] Under this doctrine, ""those who petition government for redress are generally immune from antitrust liability."" Professional Real Estate Investors, Inc. v. Columbia Pictures Indus., 508 U.S. 49, 56, 123 L. Ed. 2d 611, 113 S. Ct. 1920 (1993). 
Under the sham exception to the Noerr-Pennington doctrine, however, there is no immunity if the effort to influence or obtain 
government action is in fact only an attempt to interfere with the business relationships of a competitor. Id. Some courts have 
extended the Noerr-Pennington doctrine to immunity from tort claims. See Brownsville Golden Age Nursing Home, Inc. v. Wells, 
839 F.2d 155, 159-60 (3d Cir. 1988)."
1582,10," Contrary to the defendants' arguments, the plaintiffs sufficiently allege a prospective relationship between the plaintiffs and the 
MLUA. See Cloverleaf Dev., 500 A.2d at 167 (stating that averment of interference with a prospective relation be ""sufficient to 
allege a reasonable likelihood or probability that an anticipated business arrangement would have been consummated."")."
1582,11," The retainer agreement is between Phillips Associates and the MLUA. Since no defendant has argued that Richard Phillips 
has failed to allege the existence of a contract between him and the MLUA, the court does not address the issue. "
1583,12," The defendants allegedly caused the union members to sever their relationship with the MLUA, which interfered with the 
relationship between the MLUA and the plaintiffs. Though the alleged interference was indirect, the claim is legally sufficient 
because the plaintiffs allege that the defendants acted for the specific purpose of interfering with the plaintiffs' contract with the 
MLUA. See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 766, cmt. p. (""If A induces B to break a contract with C, persons other than C who 
may be harmed by the action as, for example, his employees or suppliers, are not within the scope of the protection afforded by 
this rule, unless A intends to affect them. Even then they may not be able to recover unless A acted for the purpose of interfering 
with their contracts."")"
1583,13," The defendants argue that their conduct is privileged because the umpires were exercising their right to choose a labor union. 
The court disagrees. HN13[
] The NLRA does not grant one the privilege to defame another maliciously. See Linn v. United Plant Guard Workers of Am., 383 U.S. 53, 15 L. Ed. 2d 582, 86 S. Ct. 657, (1966) (holding that the NLRA does not preempt 
state law malicious libel claims). Moreover, privilege in this case raises fact issues that the court cannot determine by preliminary 
objection. See Small v. Juniata College, 452 Pa.Super. 410, 682 A.2d 350, 354 (1996) (citing six factors in Restatement 
(Second) of Torts § 767 that a court must weigh in determining whether an interference was privileged)."
1583,14," The Complaint does not allege that the MLB defendants defamed them, and it is not clear how the MLB defendants acted 
improperly. The plaintiffs cannot base any claim of impropriety on the NLRA. But, the MLB defendants have not objected on any 
grounds except preemption."
1583,15," The Complaint sets forth allegations of false statements that are too vague to support a defamation claim. See Complaint PP 
42, 48-52, 68, 101. Furthermore, the defendants' alleged statements that the resignation plan was doomed and flawed and that 
Phillips had caused umpire dissension are mere opinion and are not actionable. Complaint P 78. Baker v. Lafayette College, 516 
Pa. 291, 532 A.2d 399, 402 (1987) (HN16[
] ""Opinion without more does not create a cause of action in libel [unless] the "
1584,," communicated opinion may reasonably be understood to imply the existence of undisclosed defamatory facts justifying the 
opinion."")"
1584,16," The court does not decide whether the Linn standard for labor dispute defamation applies, because the plaintiffs have alleged 
malice and actual harm."
1584,17," Publicity differs from publication, an element of defamation. Curran, 578 A.2d at 13. ""Publication occurs whenever a 
defamatory statement is communicated to another person."" Flaxman v. Burnett, 393 Pa.Super. 520, 574 A.2d 1061, 1066 
(1990). "
1585,18," The UFTA replaced the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyances Act, 39 P.S. § 351 et seq., in 1994. "
1586,19," Under the NLRA, the NLRB may impose liability on a union for its predecessor's unfair labor practice if there is ""substantial 
continuity"" between the two unions. Local Union No. 5741, United Mine Workers of Am. v. N.L.R.B., 865 F.2d 733, 736-37 (6th 
Cir. 1989). Labor law successor liability, which courts derived to further the NLRA policy of preventing labor unrest, Id. at 736, is 
not applicable in determining whether a union may be held liable for another union's debts outside the labor law context. "
1595,1," See In re Terazosin Hydrochloride Antitrust Litig., 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20477, Civ. No. 99-MDL-1317, slip. op. at 8-11 (S.D.

1599,5," Cited here and in previous decisions of this Court, the Cardizem CD case concerns an alleged agreement between drug 
manufacturers to restrain generic competition for the United States market for Cardizem CD. See In re Cardizem CD Antitrust 
Litig., 105 F. Supp. 2d 618 (E.D. Mich. 2000) [""Cardizem I""]; In re Cardizem CD Antitrust Litig., 105 F. Supp. 2d 682 (E.D. Mich.

testimony similar, if not identical, to the contentions and expert testimony present in this case. See Cardizem III, 200 F.R.D. at 
301, 308, 322."
1599,6," (See Pls. Reply at 6-8; Pls.' Mem. Ex. C (Schondelmeyer Decl. PP 28-36, 42); Pls.' Mem. Ex. D (Solow Decl. PP 12-14).) The 
plaintiffs have retained Dr. Stephen W. Schondelmeyer [""Schondelmeyer""], professor of pharmacy management and economics 
at the University of Minnesota, and Dr. John Solow [""Solow""], associate professor of economics at the University of Iowa, as 
experts in this matter as well as the Cardizem CD case. Both Dr. Schondelmeyer and Dr. Solow are credible expert witnesses 
based on their background, experience, and review of pertinent materials. As previously noted, however, the ""weight to be given 
to [their] testimony and its effect is for the fact finder in assessing the merits of plaintiffs' claims at a later date."" In re Domestic 
Air Transp. Antitrust Litig., 137 F.R.D. at 692 (emphasis added); see supra note 4."
1599,7," (See Defs.' Opp'n at 29 (""if generic terazosin had been launched sooner it would have cost less than branded Hytrin and taken 
sales away from it""); see also id. at 20 (acknowledging that, within nine months of its introduction, generic terazosin 
hydrochloride accounted for 70% of all terazosin hydrochloride sales).) "
1600,8," The phrase ""lost profits"" refers to additional profits that a direct purchaser would have made in the absence of the defendants' 
illegal agreements. See Cardizem III, 200 F.R.D. at 308 n.8 (citation omitted). As one might expect, the calculation of lost profits 
depends almost entirely on facts peculiar to each direct purchaser."
1600,9," The defendants vehemently maintain that it is ""absurd"" for direct purchasers in antitrust cases involving the pharmaceutical 
industry to measure an overcharge by examining the costs of buying a branded drug as compared to its generic equivalent 
because they are ""different"" products. (See, e.g., Def.'s Opp'n at 10.) They advance a number of interesting but unhelpful 
analogies to make this point. (See id. (drawing analogy to automobile industry that implicitly assumes that Chevrolets are 
""generic"" products or perfect substitutes for Mercedes); id. at 12 (making similarly inapt comparison between Coca-Cola and 
Royal Crown Cola); Tr., Jan. 19, 2001 (arguing that Diet Coke and Diet Pepsi are ""bioequivalent but different products,"" 
notwithstanding the fact that neither is a generic product or used principally for its therapeutic effect). They also point to 
numerous superficial differences between branded and generic Hytrin: varying chemical structures, different inactive ingredients, 
different delivery mechanisms, differences in color, shape, or labeling, brand identity and the concomitant willingness of some 
consumers to pay more for the brand name. (See Tr., Jan. 19, 2001.) Terazosin hydrochloride is the relevant subject for purposes of measuring the alleged overcharge. Abbott developed, marketed, 
and sold that substance for its therapeutic effects under the brand name ""Hytrin,"" and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
[""FDA""] confirmed generic terazosin hydrochloride as a bioequivalent, therapeutic substitute. (See, e.g., Pls.' Reply at 22.) 
American consumers ingested it as such. See supra note 7. Even the defendants' expert, Dr. Richard Rozek of National 
Economic Research Associates, Inc., has characterized an FDA-approved generic drug as a ""perfect substitute."" (See Pls.' 
Reply, Ex. 3 at 27.) On the present record, the Court does not perceive a material difference between branded and generic 
terazosin hydrochloride. See Cardizem III, 200 F.R.D. at 311; In re Domestic Air Transp. Antitrust Litig., 137 F.R.D. at 687-88

performs substantially the same function, in substantially the same manner, and for the same purpose""). "

] even if it could be shown that some individual class members were not injured, class certification, 
nevertheless, is appropriate where the antitrust violation has caused widespread injury to the class"")."
1601,11," The defendants have not demonstrated that any direct purchaser used a pre-existing contract for a fixed quantity of goods to 
""pass on"" an overcharge to an indirect purchaser. (See Pls.' Reply at 12-14.) It appears, however, that the proposed class 
includes specialty distributors and repackagers that did not purchase generic drugs. The Court will exclude these direct 
purchasers from the class definition. (See Defs.' Opp'n at 25; Pls.' Reply at 12.) "

(citing Ad-Vantage Tel. Directory Consultants, 849 F.2d at 1345-46). "
1622,1," The Court recites Fed.R.Civ.P. 50 as it read before December 1, 2000 when amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil 
Procedure took effect. The pre-December 2000 version of the rules governs this case. "
1624,2," In fact, as examples, both Geller and Crosby denied at trial that they were significant customers (major accounts) for GAC, and 
Viazis did not offer evidence to disprove their denials. "
1625,3," Again, Geller and Crosby denied being major GAC accounts. "
1626,4," In an effort to make sense of Viazis' nebulous and amorphous conspiracy theory, GAC actually submitted a discussion of 
conscious parallelism as applicable to one conspiracy while the customer complaint cases cited in the main text applied to 
another. Specifically, GAC argued: ""Let's take the conspiracy that says that everyone in the orthodontic industry, including GAC 
and Mr. Dohn, follow an unwritten rule against comparative advertisement of apparently both products and services. What that is 
governed by . . . is an area of the law called consciously parallel business behavior."" (Trial Trans. at 1139.) Later, GAC offered; 
""Now, the second conspiracy that we have here . . . [-] and it's not a second conspiracy but [an] alternative articulation [-] . . . is 
whether GAC and Mr. Dohn conspired with a group of its customers to injure Dr. Viazis or to restrain the bracket."" (Id. at 1142.) 
""The cases that are most relevant to this conspiracy . . . are the children cases, the progeny of the United States Supreme Court 
case of Monsanto v. Spray-Rite [including Culbertson in the Fifth Circuit]."" (Id.) Ultimately, however, all roads lead to Damascus 
here. The Monsanto line of cases appear to this Court to impact both conspiracies, or articulations of one conspiracy. They do 
so, as explained in the main text, in that they remove GAC and Dohn from this case because they show that as a matter of law 
Viazis did not demonstrate GAC acted collusively on either front. "
1628,5," Viazis attempted to argue the conscious parallelism jurisprudence cited in the main text is inapplicable here, because he has 
provided direct evidence of collusion with ""the Dohn letter being Exhibit A."" (Trial Transcript at 1179.) By the Court's reading of 
the Dohn letter, it can only reasonably be direct evidence that some of GAC's accounts threatened GAC with a withdrawal of 
business, Dohn believed orthodontists generally would be extremely unhappy with Viazis' marketing methods, and Dohn thought 
orthodontists and others involved with the profession talked to each other about matters such as those methods, spreading their 
views rapidly. (See Pl.'s Exhibit 75.) In fact, by the Court's reading the Dohn letter cannot reasonably be read as much indirect 
evidence of collusion."
1628,6," Interestingly, Viazis really didn't say much about the SWSO. He did note that Dr. Geller, one of the attendees at Viazis' now 
fabled seminar, was its president-elect at the time. Indeed, none of the parties really focused on the SWSO. The Court believes 
it could not have been liable here if the AAO was not. Thus, the Court has, for the most part, viewed both the AAO and SWSO in 
the same light. "
1630,7," As noted in the Supreme Court's opinion, HN15[
] the Federal Trade Commission Act's ""prohibition of unfair competition and deceptive acts or practices, 15 U.S.C. § 45(a)(1), overlaps the scope of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1, aimed at prohibiting 
restraints of trade."" Id. at 1609, n.3 (citation omitted)."
1630,8," Viazis testified he did not know at the time he was given a choice between accepting punishment or having a hearing over what 
the punishment would be, he only later learned through discovery that had he accepted punishment, there would have been a 
recommendation of punishment consisting of the withdrawing of some of his ads. (Trial Transcript at 400). "
1631,9," The Court notes that orthodontists were not competitors of Viazis in the orthodontics bracket market. That is, they competed 
with him in providing orthodontic services. Viazis claimed damages, however, in the orthodontics bracket market. Thus, a 
common indicator of a Per Se situation, defendants competing with a plaintiff in the allegedly harmed market, is missing here."
1631,10," The court notes Viazis submitted two cases for the proposition that the use of a trade group to effect a group boycott has been 
termed a Per Se violation. See  Radiant Burners, Inc. v. Peoples Gas Light and Coke Co., 364 U.S. 656, 81 S. Ct. 365, 5 L. Ed. 
2d 358 (1961) and Silver v. New York Stock Exchange, 373 U.S. 341, 83 S. Ct. 1246, 10 L. Ed. 2d 389 (1963). The Court 
reviewed these cases, and as a preliminary matter, believes them to be distinguishable. Moreover, the much more recent 
California Dental Association and Northwest Wholesale Stationers, Inc. cases clearly indicate that this is a Rule of Reason case."
1631,11," Plaintiff must make this showing with respect to a relevant product market and geographic market. Muenster Butane, Inc., 651 
F.2d at 295. Plaintiff stated at trial that one of his contested issues of fact and law was ""whether the geographic market in issue 
[was] . . . the world."" (Joint Final Pre-trial Order at 11). Based on the argument at trial, the Court concluded that the relevant 
geographic market is the world. "
1632,12," This would be the case, because total or near total exclusion of a truly innovative product could have two market wide output 
detrimental effects: (a) insulating other products already in the market from quality-based competition or (b) preventing 
introduction of an item that could stimulate interest in the product category as a whole thereby suppressing production of the 
item in the market as a whole."
1632,13," The parties do acknowledge that the brackets market largely consists of manufacturers/distributors on one side as sellers and 
medical professionals - orthodontists and dentists - on the buyer's side (Trial Transcript at 570). The ultimate recipients of 
orthodontic brackets, the patients, participate in the market for orthodontic services. "
1633,14," Viazis did offer evidence that suggested harm to consumers in the orthodontic services product market, but unfortunately none 
of it explained the relationship of such harm to the brackets market. Several of his witnesses suggested that Viazis' brackets 
were such innovative orthodontic appliances that they would substantially reduce the time patients would have to spend in 
orthodontic treatment, and thereby lower overall costs of such treatment. An argument could be made that such lower costs 
would stimulate demand for such services and thereby affect the demand for products serving as inputs to producing orthodontic 
services such as brackets. Unfortunately for Viazis, none of those witnesses explained this relationship. "
1635,15," First,  in Re/Max International, Inc. v. Realty One, Inc., 173 F.3d 995, 1002 (6th Cir. 1999), the plaintiffs accused the 
defendants of, among other things, a Sherman Act Section 1 violation. Specifically, Re/Max accused two local northeast Ohio 
real estate agencies of conspiring against Re/Max by offering Re/Max agents a lower split of commissions from sales of homes 
listed by the agencies to buyers represented by the Re/Max agents. Id. Although the Sixth Circuit ultimately held against Re/Max 
on its Section 1 claim, as with Indiana Federation of Dentists, there had been a much more obvious showing of market power in 
the record than that present here. Id. at 1003, 1015. Second,  in Realty Multi-List, Inc., 629 F.2d at 1357-58, the United States 
challenged the membership criteria of a multiple listing service in Muscogee County Georgia as being violative of Section 1. 
Viazis's counsel pointed the court to the Fifth Circuit's statement that: While 'the issue of market power is inescapably present in any inquiry about impact on competition,' . . . the question before 
us is not whether [the listing service] has a monopoly in the relevant market; rather we must determine whether [the listing 
service] is of 'sufficient economic importance that exclusion results in the denial of the opportunity to compete effectively on 
equal terms.' Id. at 1373 (citations omitted). Apparently, Viazis hoped to suggest that GAC or the AAO were sufficiently important to his efforts 
to sell into the orthodontic bracket market that their actions denied him the opportunity to compete in such market. It is obvious 
the Court's discussion in the main text makes plain that this language could not have saved Viazis' harm to competition case. 
Finally, the rest is more of the same. These include: a case having no precedential weight because it was vacated pursuant to a 
settlement agreement, Great Western Directories, Inc. v. Southwestern Bell Telephone Co., 63 F.3d 1378, 1386 (5th Cir. 1995), 
modified, 74 F.3d 613, vacated pursuant to settlement agreement (August 21, 1996), cert dismissed, 117 S. Ct. 26, Fineman v. 
World Armstrong Indus., 980 F.2d 171 (3rd Cir. 1992); Rebel Oil Co. v. Atlantic Ritohfield Co., 51 F.3d 1421 (9th Cir. 1995); Ball 
Mem'l Hosp., Inc. v. Mutual Hosp. Ins., Inc., 784 F.2d 1325 (7th Cir. 1986)."
1635,16," Viazis testified that the GDAO actually met shortly after his seminar in 1996. He acknowledged that a motion to expel him from 
the GDAO was tabled at such meeting. (Trial Transcript at 542). Further, Viazis agreed that the GDAO's Claude Stephens 
actually wrote the AAO about Viazis in June 1997. (See id. at 543.) "
1636,17," It should be noted that the Court received a letter dated June 6, 2001 from Viazis' counsel wherein such counsel submitted 
that this Court should ""reconsider its oral pronouncement of its intention to dismiss this action,"" in light of Spectators' 
Communication an Network, Inc. v. Colonial Country Club, 253 F.3d 215 (5th Cir. 2001). He failed to illuminate the Court as to 
what specifically in this case should change the Court's ""mind."" Nonetheless, the Court has reviewed the case, and presumes 
Viazis has called attention to this holding: ""There can be sufficient evidence of a combination or conspiracy when one 
conspirator lacks a direct interest in precluding competition, but is enticed or coerced into knowingly curtailing competition by 
another conspirator who has an anticompetitive motive."" Id. at 222. This language does not detract from the Court's analysis and 
application of other antitrust precedent. Indeed, the Court's opinion is a lengthy way of showing, based on precedent such as the 
Culberson case and others, that sufficient evidence was not presented to show that GAC was coerced or enticed by anyone into 
disassociating from Viazis. "
1641,1," Plaintiffs rely on publicly available information about these agreements. The court denied plaintiffs' motion to compel Ameritech 
to produce a much larger number of agreements with site owners. Ameritech has not objected to the admissibility of those 
portions of Dr. Phillips' report that describe the agreements at issue. Ameritech has referred to the terms of the agreements 
described in Dr. Phillips' report as ""alleged"" terms. For summary judgment purposes, the court assumes that Dr. Phillips has 
described the terms accurately. "
1643,2," Ameritech has reserved the right to argue, if trial were necessary, that the relevant product market is the broader market for 
providing telephone service to people in transit. That market includes cellular telephones and other wireless telephone services. 
Ameritech contends that the availability of such wireless alternatives constrains the pricing of pay telephone services to end-
users. That contention may well have merit, and that merit may strengthen over time, assuming the continued proliferation of 
alternatives to pay telephones. See generally SBC Communs. v. FCC, 56 F.3d 1484, 1493-94, 312 U.S. App. D.C. 414 (D.C. 
Cir. 1995) (affirming as ""perfectly reasonable"" an FCC decision combining cellular and landline interexchange services in the 
same product market). Because Ameritech has chosen to accept plaintiffs' proposed product definition for purposes of summary 
judgment, the court need not decide whether a broader definition would be more appropriate under the Sherman Act. "
1644,3," After pointing out the difficulty of defining geographic markets for such stationary consumer products and services, the authors 
of the Areeda treatise simply moved on: ""For the remainder of this discussion, we postulate goods that can move to customers."" 
Areeda, et al., ¶ 553a at 239. The courts cannot indulge in such postulates, however, and in some cases must still wrestle with 
the problem."
1644,4," To the extent this reasoning can lead to geographic markets too tiny to be deemed significant, however, there are lower limits 
for the size of geographic markets. See generally, e.g., Elliott v. United Center, 126 F.3d 1003, 1005 (7th Cir. 1997) (affirming 
dismissal of complaint based on theory that ""food sales within United Center"" in Chicago was relevant market). "
1646,5," If it shows anything, the effect of the Ameritech price increase tends to show that the relevant product market cannot be limited 
to pay telephones because a price increase is likely to cause significant shifts away from pay telephones to cellular phones and 
other forms of mobile communication. As noted above in note 2, however, Ameritech has accepted the limited product market for 
purposes of summary judgment. "
1652,1," The Complaint has been amended twice. The Second Amended Complaint -- which among other things, added allegations of 
fraudulent concealment -- was filed on July 23, 1999. "
1654,2," See New Jersey Stat. Ann. § 56:9-14 (""For purposes of this section, a cause of action for a continuing violation is deemed to 
arise at any time during the period of such violation"") (effective May 21, 1970); Connecticut Gen. Stat. Ann. § 35-40 (""For 
purposes of this section, a cause of action for a continuing violation is deemed to accrue at any time during the period of the 
violation"") (effective July 1, 1971); Minnesota Stat. Ann. § 325D.64 (""For the purposes of this section, a cause of action for a 
continuing violation is deemed to arise at any time during the period of the violation""); Maryland Code Ann. Comm. Law § 11-

violation""); Alaska Statutes 45.50.588 (""For purposes of this section, a claim for a continuing violation is considered to accrue at 
any time during the period of the violation""); Nevada Rev. Stat. Ann. § 598A.220.3 (""For the purpose of this section, a cause of 
action for a continuing violation arises at any time during the period of such violation""); West Virginia Code § 47-18-11 (""For the 
purpose of this section, a cause of action for a continuing violation is deemed to arise at any time during the period of such 
violation""); Delaware Code tit. 65, § 2.111 (""For purposes of this section, a cause of action for a continuing violation is deemed to 
accrue at any time during the period of such violation""); New Mexico Stat. Ann. § 57-1-12C (""For the purposes of this section, a 
cause of action for a continuing violation is deemed to accrue at any time during the period of the violation""); Rhode Island Gen. 
Laws § 6-36-23 (""For the purposes of this section, a cause of action for a continuing violation is deemed to arise at any time 
during the period of the violation""); Texas Bus. & Com. Code Ann. § 15.25(a) (""For the purpose of this subsection, a cause of 
action for a continuing violation is considered to accrue at any and all times during the period of the violation""). "
1657,3," The Court is aware of Defendants' arguments regarding the State's alleged knowledge of a cause of action and lack of due 
diligence in bringing suit. Such arguments, however, are not relevant towards the Court's legal interpretation of the meaning of 
the key language of Haw. Rev. Stat. § 480-24(a). "
1681,1," The parties have also filed motions to seal all of the motion papers because they contain proprietary or confidential information 
subject to protective order. See paper nos. 67, 72, 97, 104, 108, 110, 118, and 125. No oppositions have been received. Those 
motions are GRANTED. The parties have also moved for leave to file supplemental memoranda and responses, see paper nos. 
90, 105, 109, 115, 116, 121, 122 and 127, and one to exceed the page limit, paper no. 106. Those motions are GRANTED. "
1682,2," LoopNet provides other services, some generating income, and it sells advertising space on the public areas of its site. "
1684,3," LoopNet has not identified which licensing agreements pertain to which alleged infringing photographs. Accordingly, it would 
not be appropriate to grant it summary judgment on this issue, even were the court to find that any of the agreements contained 
a sufficient consent by CoStar to the internet use of the photographs. "
1687,4," The DMCA states: ""HN13[
] The limitations on liability… apply to a service provider only if the service provider has designated an agent to receive notifications of claimed infringement described in paragraph (3)."" 17 U.S.C. 512(c)(2) (1998). It is 
undisputed that LoopNet did not designate an agent until December 8, 1999. Paper no. 96, at 33. Therefore, the safe harbor is 
only available to LoopNet with regard to its liability (if any) arising after that date."
1687,5," LoopNet first received at least some notice of infringements from CoStar in the form of a letter on February 16, 1998. Paper no. 
1, at 7, ex. G. CoStar refers in one brief to the first of its seven notices to LoopNet occurring on February 28, 1999. Paper no. 71, 
at 26. However, all other briefs and exhibits show no evidence of a February 28, 1999 notice, but prove the existence of the 
February 16, 1998 letter. "
1689,6," CoStar makes an argument both here and when addressing the issue of contributory infringement directly that LoopNet's use of 
humans to check photographs as opposed to the mere use of an automated process distinguishes it from the ""technology"" line 
of cases, notably Napster. While CoStar is correct in that ongoing, active control over the facilities used by infringers is the 
critical issue, whether the uploading process is controlled by technological or human barriers is irrelevant. LoopNet has people 
checking photographs for purposes other than copyright infringement (Paper no. 87, at 52) and CoStar's own experts could not 
distinguish between a CoStar and non-CoStar photograph upon inspection. Id. at 26, Ex. 20. Essentially, the difference between 
human or computer control does not change the calculus that LoopNet only had notice, if ever, when informed of alleged 
infringements by CoStar and that the existence of ongoing, active control is proven without reference to the human/technology 
dichotomy."
1689,7," The parties concentrate on the legislative history which reports that the definition includes ""providing Internet access, e-mail, 
chat room and web page hosting services."" H.R. Rep. No. 105-551, at 64 (1998). They then debate whether LoopNet provides 
webpage hosting services. "
1690,8," HN27[
] If the service provider has actual knowledge under § 512(c)(1)(A)(i) or ""red flag"" knowledge under § 512(c)(1)(A)(ii), the ""take down"" provisions of § 512(c)(1)(A)(iii) must be met to stay in the safe harbor. Alternatively, if it receives notification of 
claimed infringement in accordance with § 512(c)(3), the ""take down"" provisions of § 512(c)(1)(C) must be met. "
1692,9," A finding that the ""right and ability to control"" standard could be met merely by the ability to remove or block access to materials 
would render the DMCA internally inconsistent. The result would be that the very policy mandated by the DMCA in § 
512(c)(1)(C) to remain in the safe harbor, terminating infringers and blocking access, would force service providers to lose their 
immunity by violating § 512(c)(1)(B). See Hendrickson, 2001 WL 1078981, at *9. "
1693,10," It is undisputed that ""LoopNet does not claim immunity for damages prior to LoopNet's registration under the DMCA."" Paper 
no. 87, at 35 n. 20. CoStar identifies 179 photographs that fall in that category of photographs identified before safe harbor took 
effect. Paper. No. 96, at 33. However, CoStar does not claim that LoopNet is liable for the contributory infringement of its 
photographs before it sent the first notification of alleged infringement to LoopNet on February 16, 1998. Paper no. 1, at 7. The 
issues of liability addressed in this section pertain to those photographs that were alleged to be infringed between that first notice 
and the safe harbor. "
1704,1, Plaintiffs have dropped PB Electronics as a defendant in the second amended complaint.
1704,2," In addition, in the second amended complaint, plaintiffs allege that the per processor and long term license agreements 
between Microsoft and the OEM defendants remained in force after the signing of the July 15, 2001 consent decree between 
Microsoft and the Justice Department. This allegation is made in response to a limitations argument made by the OEM 
defendants. I do not find it necessary to address that argument or the efficacy of the amended allegation. "
1705,3," Plaintiffs seek to represent a series of classes who purchased computers sold to class members by Compaq or Dell on which 
Microsoft operating software or applications software had been installed. If they were not seeking ""pass through"" damages, there "
1706,," is no reason their proposed classes would be so limited. Instead, presumably they would seek to represent all persons who had 
allegedly been damaged by the alleged conspirators, whether or not they had purchased their computers from Compaq or Dell."
1706,4," Plaintiffs quarrel with the ""exception"" terminology, contending that the absence of these two concerns in a conspiracy case 
renders Illinois Brick inapplicable ab initio, rather than providing a basis for the creation of an exception to its holding. I recognize 
the logic of plaintiffs' argument but will refer in the text to the ""co-conspirator exception"" since that is the term that has become 
conventional in the case law. My conclusion remains the same whatever phraseology is used. "
1713,1," Throughout this Memorandum Opinion, the Court uses the term ""Defendants"" to refer collectively to ExxonMobil Corporation, 
as it exists today, following the November 30, 1999 merger, and Exxon Corporation and Mobil Corporation, as they existed prior 
to the merger. Following the merger, Exxon Corporation became Exxon Mobil Corporation, and Mobil became a wholly owned 
subsidiary of ExxonMobil. See Def. Mot. at 1 n.1. "
1714,2," For a detailed background of the District of Columbia's approach to conflict of laws, see Pearce v. E.F. Hutton Group, Inc., 664 
F. Supp. 1490, 1494-1496 (D.D.C. 1987)."
1714,3," The Court defers to a later date addressing the issue of whether Texas law conflicts with either District of Columbia law or 
Virginia law because the parties themselves do not identify the applicable Texas law, nor whether such law conflicts with the 
relevant laws from D.C. or Virginia. "
1715,4," The parties appear to agree that if Virginia law is applied to Plaintiff's unfair competition claim, Count Four must be dismissed. 
See Def. Mem. at 4-5; Pl. Opp'n at 10. "
1717,5, Defendants do not contend that Plaintiffs have insufficiently alleged any of the other elements of Count Five. 
1718,6," Although Defendants included materials outside the pleadings in its Memorandum see Defendants' Memorandum at 6-7, 
Defendants now indicate a desire that the court to base its findings solely upon Plaintiffs' First Amended complaint. See Def. 
Reply at 1. Accordingly, Plaintiffs' motion to strike Defendants motion for judgement on the pleadings shall be denied."
1718,7," This Court has also defined the elements for this claim as: (1) the opposing party intentionally interfered with business 
opportunities, and (2) that there was resulting damage. See Sage v. Broadcasting Publs., 997 F. Supp. 49, 54 (D.D.C. 1998) 
(citing Brown v. Carr, 503 A.2d 1241, 1247 (D.C. 1986)). "
1720,8," Indeed, Plaintiffs' claim of injury does not even appear to ripen until sale of the divestiture assets, which occurred after the 
merger of Exxon and Mobil. This fact alone might foreclose Plaintiffs' Section 1985(3) claim. "
1721,9," For a detailed discussion of those circuits that have drawn exceptions in applying the doctrine to Section 1985(3) claims, see 
Dickerson, 200 F.3d at 768 n.9. "
1722,10," Having found that both Plaintiffs are unable to recover for conspiracy under 42 U.S.C. § 1985(3), the Court need not address 
the separate issue of whether Plaintiff Mamo has standing to bring a claim under Section 1985(3). "
1736,1," The remedial provisions of the Clayton Act are actually spread over far more than the two sections the defendants mention. In 
addition to §§ 4 and 16, the Clayton Act also includes (as codified) 15 U.S.C. § 15(b) (suits for actual damages brought by 
foreign governments), 15 U.S.C. § 15a (suits for treble damages brought by the United States for its own injuries to business or 
property), 15 U.S.C. § 15c (parens patriae suits brought by state attorneys general for treble damages on behalf of natural 
persons in the state), and 15 U.S.C. § 25 (actions for injunctive relief brought by the Attorney General). "
1752,1," However, in his Declaration, Defendant David Branch alleges that there are only two OHL located in the U.S. -- the one in 
Plymouth and the one in Erie. No mention is made about the Sault Ste. Marie club. (Dfts' Br., Ex. A at P 5). "
1753,2," Apparently, the 20 year old players are ""overage"" because, under OHL eligibility rules, its players generally range in age from 
16 to 19. (Dfts' Br, Ex. A at P 6)."
1753,3," The actual text of the Rule states, ""It should be understood that to sign and register an overage player, such player must have 
been on a CHA or USA Hockey Player's Registration Certificate in the previous season."" (Dfts' Br, Ex. A-1). Defendants 
acknowledge that the Rule has the effect Plaintiff alleges. Defendants state that the Rule ""restricts the ability of 20 year old 
NCAA college players from playing in the OHL."" (Dft's Br. at 1). They explain, ""Typically, players for a NCAA college hockey 
team will not satisfy this requirement because the NCAA does not allow persons holding a CHA certificate to play hockey at an 
NCAA School."" (Id., n. 1). "
1754,4," In addition, the Supreme Court emphasized, ""HN7[
] The doctrine of forum non conveniens . . . is designed in part to help 
courts avoid conducting complex exercises in comparative law."" Id. The Third Circuit's approach would undermine that objective. 
Piper at 250. Another practical implication of the Third Circuit's holding is that it would increase litigation in the American courts. "
1755,," ""The American courts, which are already extremely attractive to foreign plaintiffs, would become even more attractive. The flow 
of litigation into the United States would increase and further congest already crowded courts."" Id. at 252. "
1757,5," The Howe court further distinguished antitrust law from the Securities Act. ""The Court in National City Lines I relied heavily on 
the legislative history of the antitrust law's special venue statute. It found, in that history, especially strong reasons for believing 
Congress did not want to permit courts to transfer cases, irrespective of convenience."" Howe at 948. The Howe court found that 
no similar ""unusual legislative history"" pertaining to the Securities Act's venue statute. Id. at 949. "
1759,6," Section 45(1)(c) deals with conspiracies to ""prevent, lessen, unduly, competition in the production, manufacture, purchase, 
barter, sale, storage, rental, transportation or supply of produce, or in a price of insurance on persons or property . . . ."""
1759,7," Plaintiff's inability to pursue its own claim and the improbability that any administrative complaint would result in a prosecution 
distinguishes this case from Lueck v. Sundstrand Corporation, 236 F.3d 1137 (9th Cir. 2001), an opinion upon which Defendants 
rely. In that case, the court found that New Zealand was an adequate alternative forum even though it did not allow civil actions 
for personal injury resulting from automobile accidents. New Zealand's Accident Compensation System was adequate because it 
covered all medical and rehabilitative expenses and a portion of injured parties' lost income. Further, suit could be brought for 
mental distress not resulting from physical injury, and for the recovery of punitive or exemplary damages.  Id. at 1141-1142. 
Therefore, unlike in this case, the plaintiff had clear avenues for seeking adequate relief in New Zealand. "
1762,8," In its Reply, Defendants cite some opinions requiring that a union's failure to allege an antitrust injury deemed the union to lack 
antitrust standing. However, in those opinions, the union was asserting injury to itself rather than to its membership, and the 
courts held that the unions' own injury was insufficient. None of Defendants' cases contradict the foregoing HN21[
] authority 
allowing a union to establish associational standing to enjoin the continued antitrust injury to its membership even when the 
union has not, itself, suffered an injury. "
1763,9," Section 1391(d) states, ""An alien may be sued in any district."" "
1765,10," The arbitrator found: The record reveals that agreements between the NHL and the CHL go back for more than 40 years. The current agreement 
between the NHL and the CHL provides significant benefits for each party. Among such benefits are the following. The NHL 
makes substantial financial payments to the CHL and funds various resources for the CHL players. The NHL also 
cooperates in providing certain resources, where possible, to CHL member clubs such as coaching, scouting, club 
management and player consultation. The CHL provides the NHL with financial information regarding the operation of its 
member clubs. Rules exist for the loan and recall of NHL players to and from the CHL. CHL games are played according to 
NHL rules. NHL clubs at their opinion may undertake the rehabilitation of injured CHL players. Each CHL club agrees to 
use its best efforts to provide rink advertising space for the purpose of promoting the NHL. (Plt's Br., Ex. 1-C at 15). "
1774,1," Defendant has not called into question plaintiff's characterization of Hi-Lex Corporation as a subdivision of a Japanese 
company. Therefore, complete diversity of citizenship appears to exist on the present record. "
1775,2, Plaintiff has appealed that decision to Judge McKeague. FED. R. CIV. P. 72(a). 
1777,3," The certification of the judge is generally referred to as ""exemplification."" It is unclear why defense counsel failed to follow the 
simple requirements of the statute, thus providing the occasion for the litigation of unnecessary issues. "
1788,1," ""Monoline"" is an industry term indicating a financial institution which has no branches and specializes in banking by mail and 
the credit and charge card industry. "
1789,2," ""Portfolio skew"" is the parties' term describing the degree to which an issuer's card portfolio is weighted toward a particular 
association. For example, in 1998, 93% of U.S. Bancorp's outstanding cards were Visa cards; U.S. Bancorp thus had at that 
time a portfolio highly skewed toward Visa. "
1790,3," JCB Bank, N.A. is the wholly-owned North American subsidiary of JCB International Credit Card Company, Ltd., a Tokyo-
based credit card company. JCB Bank, N.A. was formed to issue JCB cards in the U.S. to consumer segments with travel and 
entertainment interests or familiarity with Japanese culture and service characteristics. In 2000 it had only approximately 25,000 
cards in circulation in the U.S. (See Krumme Dep. at 35-38.) Compared with Discover, which in 1999 was the fifth-largest issuer 
with 48 million cards in circulation, JCB is not a significant competitor at the network or issuer level. "
1791,4," In a typical payment card transaction, a merchant accepts a payment card from a customer for the provision of goods or 
services. The merchant then electronically presents the card transaction data to an ""acquirer,"" usually a bank but sometimes a 
third party processing firm, for Verification and processing. The acquirer presents the transaction data to the association (e.g. 
Visa or MasterCard) which in turn contacts the issuer (e.g. MBNA) to check the cardholder's credit line. The issuer then indicates 
to the association that it authorizes or denies the transaction; the association relays the message to the merchant's acquirer, 
who then relays the message to the credit card terminal at the merchant's point of sale. If the transaction is authorized, the 
merchant will thereafter submit a request for payment to the acquirer, which relays the request, via the association, to the issuer. 
The issuer pays the acquirer; the acquirer in turn pays the merchant, retaining a small percentage of the purchase price as a fee 
for its services, which fee it then shares with the issuer. "
1793,5," However, as discussed infra, because of the defendants' exclusionary rules, consumers cannot obtain a card that combines the 
features of the consumer's bank with the features of the American Express or Discover networks. "
1795,6," See Tr. 1313-14 (Hart, Advanta/MasterCard); Tr. 1854 (Lockhart, MasterCard) (confirming statement in P-0068, MasterCard's 
1997 Annual Report); Schall (Visa U.S.A.) Dep. at 36-37; Russell (Visa U.S.A.) CID Dep. at 55-56 (a Visa study conducted with 
hundreds of thousands of accounts demonstrated consumers ""used the debit card like a checking account, and they used the 
credit card like a credit card""); Ex. P-0355 at MCI-0806320-21; Ex. P-0522 at NH0006; Ex. P-0384 & Caputo (MasterCard) Dep. 
at 243-47 (MasterCard's US Deposit Access Group's discussion of debit's competitors did not include general purpose cards)."
1795,7," See M. Katz Dir. Test. P 103; Ex. P-0456 at MCJ4250997, 99 (September 1998 MasterCard presentation explaining that debit 
is ""a different business model from credit"" and that ""on-line debit does NOT replace credit"")."
1795,8," See Dahir (Visa U.S.A.) Dep. at 214-15 (confirming Visa analysis showing that possession of off-line debit card doesn't affect a 
consumer's spending on credit cards); Ex. P-0359 (Sept. 1998 MasterCard document summarizing several studies and 
concluding that there is little cannibalization of credit by debit); Ex. P-0076 at 1379041 (Visa Systems Payment Panel Study, 
""Impact of Check Card Acquisition: Debit cards dampen spending on paper checks with little effect noted on other payment 
alternatives."")"
1795,9," See, e.g., Ex. P-1103 at MCJ000254 (1996 MasterCard U.S. region board minutes stating ""with respect to share trends, Mr. 
Heuer noted that MasterCard has held its general purpose card dollar volume share over the past three years, but has 
experienced some share loss when compared only to Visa""); Ex. P-0750 (1998 letter to Visa U.S.A. CEO Carl Pascarella, per 
his request, providing U.S. market share of general purpose cards); Ex. P-0758 at 1 (1999 Visa U.S.A. board document "
1796,," providing ""Visa's market share of cards in circulation of major all-purpose cards""); Ex. P-1180 (1999 Visa U.S.A. board document 
calculating ""card volume . . . market shares"" for general purpose card brands); Ex. P-0793 at VU 1017663, Ex. P-0709; Stock 
(Visa U.S.A.) Dep. at 105-13. "
1797,10," See SCFC ILC v. Visa U.S.A., Inc., 819 F. Supp. 956 (D. Utah 1993), aff'd in part, rev'd in part, 36 F.3d 958 (10th Cir., 1994) 
(hereinafter ""Mountain West."") In Mountain West the Tenth Circuit considered the application of Visa's By-law 2.06, which 
prevented Discover from joining the Visa system to issue Visa cards. The court affirmed the rule, accepting Visa's arguments 
that because general purpose card networks constituted a separate, highly-concentrated market, competition in that market 
should not be further diluted by permitting Discover to enter the Visa network. The value of an additional one of thousands of 
Visa-branded issuers to intrasystem competition did not outweigh the effects of having weakened network or brand level 
competition through Discover joining the Visa network. "
1804,11," Elliott criticized the Edgar Dunn study and MasterCard generally for considering only cost savings and for failing to consider 
the revenue potential that might flow from smart cards. (See Tr. 481-82 (Elliott).) Elliott, however, was not involved in any 
respect with the marketing side of the analysis and did not know whether any revenue analysis was conducted by anyone else at 
MasterCard. (See id.; see also Tr. 532-33 & 514.) There is thus no evidence that consideration of the revenue potential might 
have yielded a business case for MasterCard proceeding with smart cards."
1804,12," Elliott also claimed at trial that Hart expressed concern in a conversation over 13 years ago that MasterCard's smart card 
project might harm his Visa portfolio. (See Tr. 565-67; 585-87 (Elliott).) I reject this testimony and credit the testimony of Hart, 
who stated that such a conversation never occurred and that his only concern regarding MasterCard's smart card project related 
to his belief that there was no business case for smart cards. (See Tr. 1395-96; 1398 (Hart, Advanta/MasterCard).) I also credit 
Hart's testimony that when he was on the Board of Directors and Executive Committee of MasterCard from 1983 to 1988, he 
never attended a meeting where a Board member encouraged MasterCard to slow down its smart card program in order to 
avoid gaining a competitive advantage over Visa. (See Tr. 1273-74 & 1396 (Hart).) The only other members John Elliott 
implicated as being opposed to MasterCard pursuing smart cards were large issuers who were not on the MasterCard Board or 
the Executive Committee. (See Tr. 576 (Elliott).) "
1813,13," The joint debit project was discontinued after a state-driven legal challenge, and debit has been offered on a non-dual basis 
for approximately fifteen years. (See Tr. 3354-56:14; 3412-13 (B. Katz, Visa U.S.A./Visa Int'l).) "
1816,14," During Fran Schall's cross-examination, plaintiff showed her a letter (not authored or received by Ms. Schall) suggesting that 
Visa agreed to offer to share its CVV technology with MasterCard, but only after MasterCard had independently developed 
similar technology. (See Tr. 5029:1-19 (Schall, Visa U.S.A.).) The letter was never shown to Linda Elliott, even though it was 
authored by her superior, Roger Peirce. In any event, Ms. Elliott, who had direct responsibilities for VisaNet and the related 
services, testified unequivocally that CVV was never in fact shared with MasterCard. (See id. at 4859-60 (L. Elliott).) "
1817,15," While MasterCard was open to non-banks such as AT&T, Visa's membership was primarily comprised of commercial banks. 
During this time period, one of the options that Visa considered to maintain or gain share was a loyalty program designed to 
skew dual members toward Visa through cash incentives. (See Russell (Visa U.S.A.) Mountain West Tr. 1435.) While this loyalty 
program was not adopted in the early 1990s, the same concept forms the basis of the current Visa partnership program. (See Tr. 
at 4536-37 (Dahir, Visa U.S.A.).)"
1817,16," In June 1993, Visa International also adopted a competitive strategy of differentiating itself from MasterCard in order to secure 
a greater share of Visa issuance from dual members. (See Tr. 3430-3431, 3434-35 (B. Katz, Visa U.S.A./Visa Int'l); Ex. P-0664.)"
1817,17," Plaintiff has suggested that these co-branding incentive payments were made disproportionately to board banks. (See Tr. 
4574-80 (Dahir, Visa U.S.A.); Ex. P-0748; Ex. P-1320, Ex. P-1321.) In fact, Visa offered these incentive payments on equal 
terms to all members that went forward with co-branding programs. (See Tr. 5005-06 (Schall, Visa U.S.A.).) The 15 to 20 banks 
that received incentives were the only issuers that were creating co-branded card products. (See id. at 5004-05 (Schall).) 
Similarly, the statistics in 1996-97 show that while a majority of MasterCard's total incentive payments (including those for co-
branding and other programs) went to the large issuers who happened to sit on the Board, a substantial amount of payments 
ranging between 30-35 percent went to non-Board members. (Compare Ex. D-4269 with Ex. D-4270.) "
1818,18," As with co-branding program incentive payments, plaintiff has suggested that incentive payments for direct mail solicitations 
were paid selectively to 10-15 and disproportionately paid to board members. In fact, in providing these incentives, Visa did not 
consider Board representation. Visa and MasterCard targeted the largest issuers who accounted for the vast majority of direct 
mail solicitations. During this time period 10-15 banks represented over 90 percent of the the solicitations. (See Tr. 5005 (Schall, 
Visa U.S.A.).) "
1828,19," Diners Club is owned by Citicorp, the largest Visa/MasterCard issuer. (See Tr. 4397 (Beindorff, Visa U.S.A.).) Although it 
ultimately never issued any JCB credit cards, Household Bank, whose representative, Mr. Saunders, was Chairman of 
MasterCard in 1996, had entered into an exclusive deal with JCB to issue JCB cards in the United States and planned to issue 
JCB cards in the United States. (See Tr. 2193-94, 2220 (Saunders, Household/Fleet).) "
1831,20," MasterCard sent a letter explaining to Banco Popular the terms and assurances it wanted in connection with Banco Popular's 
issuance of a competitive card. (See Ex. P-0145.) Banco Popular then negotiated with MasterCard for terms that it found fully 
reasonable. (See Tr. 168-73 (Kesler, Banco Popular); Ex. P-0144.) MasterCard never even sought to enforce such terms on 
Banco Popular's issuance of Visa cards. (See Tr. 173-74 (Kesler).)"
1831,21," To issue American Express cards in the United States, Banco Popular recognized that it would need marketing and other 
financial assistance from American Express to defray the costs associated with losing its Visa and MasterCard memberships. 
(See Tr. 161 (Kesler).) "
1832,22," Craft has nearly thirty years' experience at top Visa and MasterCard issuers such as NationsBank (now Bank of America) and 
Wachovia. He was called by Visa to testify on its behalf in the Mountain West trial. (See Craft (Banc One) Dep. at 1-15, 81-82.)"
1832,23," As Craft explained, ""We felt the number one reason issuers would be willing to work with American Express is they could 
improve their performance and better serve their customers."" (Craft (Banc One)Dep. at 73-74.) "
1834,24," ""Card holder spend"" measures the amount of multiple-cardholder spending that could be transacted on American Express 
cards (meaning at merchants that accept American Express, whether an American Express card is used or not) relative to the 
total credit card spending of those multiple cardholders. A cardholder spend of 96% means that consumers holding both an 
American Express card and a bank-issued Visa or MasterCard could pay for 96 out of every 100 dollars of credit expenditures 
with the American Express card. (See Tr. 2715 (Golub).) "
1844,25," Carl Pascarella implicitly conceded this when he acknowledged that the need for By-law 2.10(e) will diminish (or disappear) as 
Visa's Partnership Agreements mature (see Tr. 5239 (Pascarella)), as defendants can secure the same loyalty from their 
members by agreement that they want to ensure through their exclusionary rules. (See Williamson (Visa Int'l) Dep. at 53-54.) 
Association Board members committed by contract to defendants would be incapable of -- and uninterested in -- ""opportunistic 
behavior"" that would have the effect of damaging the association to which they have dedicated themselves. "
1845,26," The mere fact that this court had to hear testimony in camera concerning Visa's and MasterCard's negotiations and product 
development efforts with individual member banks dispels the argument that ""cohesion"" requires all members to be treated 
equally and that all association information must be shared with all members."
1845,27," See Pascarella (Visa U.S.A.) Dep. at 66-68 (failing to explain why MasterCard's joint venture status allows for differentiating 
Mastercard from American Express for 2.10(e) purposes). The ""cohesion"" justification is also belied by the long history of 
member bank dealings with American Express that has never otherwise caused a lack of ""cohesion"" among the member banks. 
See Beindorff (Visa U.S.A.) Dep. at 295-96 (ATMs, travelers checks); Allen (Visa U.S.A.) Dep. at 268-72 (banks have offered 
American Express cardholders lines of credit); Dahir (Visa U.S.A.) Dep. at 240-41; Powar (Visa U.S.A.) Dep. at 23-26 (no 
disruption to Visa system from banks issuing both Visa and American Express travelers checks); Jensen (Visa Int'l) Dep. at 13-
14 (Visa did not prohibit member issuance of American Express travelers checks); Schmalensee Dep. at 343-44, 347 (no

emerging products: ""Virtual world is an environment the bank[s] don't own so they are more willing to consider doing things 
differently (i.e., allowing Amex in a bank wallet.""). Beindorff maintains that Board banks that issue even 10% American Express 
cards would be able to stifle advertising spending even though board members with 10% MasterCard portfolios would not do so. 
See Tr. 4409 (Beindorff, Visa U.S.A.). "
1847,28," The term ""output reduction"" can mean ""a marketwide decrease in the number of units produced. But it can also refer to a 
decline in the quality of the goods, or a decline in the rate of improvement or innovation that is committed to a particular market."" 
XIII Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law P 2104a at 36; see also General Leaseways, Inc. v. National Truck Leasing Asso. 744 F.2d 
588, 595 (7th Cir. Ill. 1984) (describing economic consequences of output restrictions). "
1848,29," The fact that the Visa U.S.A. representatives on the Visa International Board have enough votes to block such a resolution is 
completely irrelevant. The court cannot assume that the Visa U.S.A. directors on the International Board would act contrary to 
the best interests of the International members as a whole and simply vote the U.S. members' ""point of view."" "
1859,1," Pursuant to Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 7012(b), Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) applies to adversary 
actions. "
1860,2," The federal court in Texas also presently is without ""the power"" to issue such an injunction in light of HN3[
] the automatic 
stay, which took effect immediately upon the filing of debtor's bankruptcy petition in this court. Absent relief from the automatic 
stay, such an order would be void ab initio or, at the very least, voidable. See Constitution Bank v. Tubbs, 68 F.3d 685, 692 
n.6 (3d Cir. 1995). Unless relief from stay is granted, the automatic stay remains in effect until the bankruptcy case is dismissed 
or closed, or until a discharge is granted or denied.  11 U.S.C. § 362(c)(2)."
1860,3," In the absence of any indication from the parties concerning the law of which state should apply to this case, we have applied 
the common law of Pennsylvania. "
1861,4," At the hearing on defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint, debtor's counsel stated on the record that debtor wished to 
withdraw its § 1962(b) cause of action. In light of this we will not address the merits of defendants' motion to dismiss Count IV as 
it pertains to § 1962(b) but instead will limit our discussion to § 1962(c). "
1864,5," This second rationale for the holding in Hirsch subsequently was undermined by the Supreme Court in Sedima v. Imrex Co., 
473 U.S. 479, 499, 105 S. Ct. 3275, 3286, 87 L. Ed. 2d 346 (1985). See Jaguar Cars, Inc. v. Royal Oaks Motor Car Co., Inc. 46 
F.3d 258, 262-63 (3d Cir. 1995). "

1873,1," When a bank acts as both a card-issuing and an acquiring institution, it retains the entire discount fee."
1873,2," As the district court noted, the complaint includes the following illustration of the chain of transactions: Bank A issues a Visa credit card to Consumer X, who purchases a garment for $ 100 at Store Y, which was ""acquired"" for 
Visa by Bank B. Visa rules mandate that Bank B must pay Bank A an interchange fee of 1.25% of the amount of the 
transaction, i.e., $ 1.25. Bank B will charge Store Y a ""discount fee"" higher than $ 1.25 in order to recover the mandated 
interchange fee and other fees that Visa rules mandate Bank B to pay Visa on each and every Visa credit card (and debit 
card) transaction and to earn a profit for itself. Thus, Bank B may charge a discount fee of 1.60% of the transaction amount 
(or $ 1.60) to Store Y. When Store Y presents Consumer X's $ 100 Visa transaction to Bank B, the bank will credit Store Y's 
account for $ 98.40, send the Visa mandated $ 1.25 interchange fee to Bank A and retain the $ .35 balance of the ""discount 
fee."" In re Visa Check/MasterMoney Antitrust Litig., 192 F.R.D. 68, 72 n.3 (E.D.N.Y. 2000). "
1874,3," Rule 23(f) provides ""[a] court of appeals may in its discretion permit an appeal from an order of a district court granting or 
denying class action certification under this rule if application is made to it within ten days after entry of the order."" Fed. R. Civ. 
P. 23(f). After the defendants' petition to appeal was granted, the appeal briefed and argued, but before we rendered this 
decision, this Court established a standard for determining whether to grant a Rule 23(f) petition: Petitioners must demonstrate 
either ""(1) that the certification order will effectively terminate the litigation and there has been a substantial showing that the 
district court's decision is questionable, or (2) that the certification order implicates a legal question about which there is a 
compelling need for immediate resolution."" In re Sumitomo Copper Litig., 262 F.3d 134, 2001 U.S. App. LEXIS 18723 at *4 (2d 
Cir. 2001). In this case, interlocutory jurisdiction was appropriate to resolve the uncertainty regarding the proper standard for 
evaluating expert opinions at the class certification stage, and to address the questions of predominance and manageability in 
light of individualized damage issues that emerge in tying cases."
1874,4," Defendants petitioned this Court under Rule 23(f) to review the district court's grant of plaintiffs' motion for class certification. 
This Court granted defendants permission to appeal the district court's grant of plaintiffs' motion for class certification, not the 
district court's denial of defendants' motion to strike. Under these circumstances, we have no jurisdiction to review the motion to 
strike. We note that a motion to strike expert evidence pursuant to Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 
125 L. Ed. 2d 469, 113 S. Ct. 2786 (1993), involves a inquiry distinct from that for evaluating expert evidence in support of a 
motion for class certification, see infra Section III. A., although the parties' substantive arguments in both instances may be 
similar, as is true in this case. A Daubert motion is typically not made until later stages in litigation, such as in association with a 
motion for summary judgment, motion in limine, or at trial, and a district court should not postpone consideration of a motion for 
class certification for the sake of waiting until a Daubert examination is appropriate. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(1) (""As soon as 
practicable after commencement of an action brought as a class action, the court shall determine by order whether it is to be so 
maintained.""). "
1875,5," HN5[
] The substantive elements of plaintiffs' illegal per se tying claim are: (1) that the tying arrangement affects a substantial 
amount of interstate commerce; (2) the two products are distinct; (3) the defendant actually tied the sale of the two products; and 
(4) the seller has appreciable market power in the tying market. See  United States v. IBM Corp., 163 F.3d 737, 741 (2d Cir. 
1998). Plaintiffs could also prove their tying claims under a rule of reason theory, requiring plaintiffs to prove that the challenged 
action had an adverse effect on competition as a whole in the relevant market and, if the defendant shows a pro-competitive 
redeeming virtue of the action, that the same pro-competitive effect could be achieved though an alternative means that is less 
restrictive of competition. See  Clorox Co. v. Sterling Winthrop, Inc., 117 F.3d 50, 56 (2d Cir. 1997). HN6[
] The substantive 
elements of a monopoly claim are that: (1) defendants have engaged in predatory or anticompetitive conduct; (2) with the 
specific intent to monopolize; and (3) with a dangerous probability of achieving monopoly power. See  Spectrum Sports, Inc. v. 
McQuillan, 506 U.S. 447, 456, 122 L. Ed. 2d 247, 113 S. Ct. 884 (1993). HN7[
] For any antitrust violation, ""a plaintiff must "
1876,," make some showing of actual injury attributable to something the antitrust laws were designed to prevent."" J. Truett Payne Co. 
v. Chrysler Motors Corp., 451 U.S. 557, 562, 68 L. Ed. 2d 442, 101 S. Ct. 1923 (1981). "
1877,6," We do not separately discuss the requirements of Rule 23(a). On appeal, defendants' arguments primarily focus on whether 
the class is maintainable under either Rule 23(b)(2) or (b)(3). To the extent that defendants contend that plaintiffs failed to 
establish commonality and typicality as required by Rule 23(a) because individualized questions will arise regarding each 
plaintiff, we, like the district court, address these arguments in the context of the predominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(3).  In 
re Visa Check/MasterMoney Antitrust Litig., 192 F.R.D. at 81-88. "
1879,7," Plaintiffs contend that defendants waived this argument by raising below the issue of steering only in the context of plaintiffs' 
ability to prove injury-in-fact on a common basis and not as a mitigation defense that would preclude a finding of predominance 
and make the class unmanageable. See  Kraebel v. New York City Dep't of Hous. Pres. and Dev., 959 F.2d 395, 401 (2d Cir. 
1992) (""We have repeatedly held that if an argument has not been raised before the district court, we will not consider it . . . .""). 
The district court correctly interpreted defendants' briefs as arguing that steering negated plaintiffs' ability to prove causation, not 
damages, by class-wide proof, although the court did observe that the steering argument could possibly be ""repackaged as one 
addressing mitigation of damages."" In re Visa Check/MasterMoney Antitrust Litig., 192 F.R.D. at 85-86. However, because 
defendants' contention that they raised below the steering argument in relation to damages finds support in their expert's 
affidavits, we address this argument on appeal."
1879,8," Plaintiffs dispute defendants' claim that the ""honor all cards"" rule permits individual merchants to steer customers to other forms 
of payment. Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment to dismiss this mitigation defense is pending before the district court. "
1881,9," A district court's ability to bifurcate a trial is limited by the Seventh Amendment. See  Blyden v. Mancusi, 186 F.3d 252, 268 (2d 
Cir. 1999) (""At bottom, issues may be divided and tried separately, but a given issue may not be tried by different, successive 
juries.""). Despite defendants' briefing on this issue, it would be premature for us to determine whether and under what 
circumstances bifurcation might be permissible in this case. "
1883,10," The dissent concedes that, under the ""tied product"" approach, ""the interests of the class members would be aligned."" Post, at 
[26]. "
1885,11," The court noted that because it found certification appropriate under both Rule 23(b)(2) and (3), its inclination was to provide 
general notice to the class but to provide opt-out only as to the damages claims. It stated, however, that it would solicit the 
parties' views on the question. Id. at 89. "
1887,1," Many district courts have ignored Judge Friendly's admonition in Abrams. But as the trial judge in this case recognized, those 
courts ""state the rule that individual damages questions will not bar class certification in conclusory fashion without assessing 
whether individual questions would predominate if each damages action had to be tried separately."" In re VisaCheck /  
Mastermoney Antitrust Litig., 192 F.R.D. at 86 n.19 (emphasis added); cf.  Szabo v. Bridgeport Machines, 249 F.3d 672, 675 
(7th Cir. 2001) (granting Rule 23(f) review because ""the district court's decision to certify the class implied that important legal 
principles have evaded attention by appellate courts. At critical junctures the district judge cited only decisions by other district 
judges, most in cases later settled and thus not subject to appellate consideration."")."
1887,2," The right to assert the defense against each and every class member is guaranteed by the Rules Enabling Act. See  Eisen v. 
Carlisle & Jacquelin, 479 F.2d 1005, 1014 (2d Cir. 1973) (recognizing that under the Act, Rule 23 cannot ""'abridge, enlarge or 
modify any substantive right'"") (quoting 28 U.S.C. § 2072), vacated on other grounds, 417 U.S. 156 (1974). "
1889,3," I agree with the majority that the ""honor all cards"" rule precluded any merchant from mitigating his alleged losses down to zero, 
Majority Op. at 17, but the issue that challenges manageability is the effect of channeling on the amount of damages. See in re 
Visa Check /  Mastermoney Antitrust Litig., 192 F.R.D. at 86 (""The fact of injury is binary; it is either there or it is not. The extent 
of injury is another question.""). "
1890,4," I also assume arguendo that plaintiffs can use common proof to show that the tie had an anticompetitive effect on the relevant 
market, a showing required of all private antitrust enforcers regardless of whether they pursue a ""per se"" or rule of reason claim. 
See  Balaklaw v. Lovell, 14 F.3d 793, 801 & n.17 (2d Cir. 1994). "
1892,5," The Areeda treatise offers the following example: Suppose a defendant's profit maximizing price for product A alone is $ 100 and that the prevailing market price for product 
B is $ 20. If the defendant's version of product B is worth $ 1 less to the plaintiff than rival brands (or if a tie is otherwise 
burdensome in the amount of $ 1), the defendant tying the two together cannot profitably charge more than $ 119 for the 
package. Phrased another way: if he charges $ 25 for tied product A, he must reduce the price of tying product A to $ 94. II Areeda & Hovenkamp, supra P 365 at 246 n.48 (emphasis added). Thus, if the tie is broken, the price of the tying product will 
increase back to $ 100. This example describes a fixed proportion tie, but even in the variable proportion context ""tied-product premiums are often offset 
by tying-product discounts below the price that would have prevailed without tying."" X Areeda et al., supra P 1769 at 431. "
1893,6," Suppose that the interchange fees in the tied world (the actual world) are $ 10 per $ 100 purchase for both credit cards and off-
line debit cards (in fact, the percentages are much smaller but the $ 10 figure is useful for illustrative purposes). Thus, regardless 
of an individual merchant's mix of credit and debit, for every 100 transactions he pays 100 x $ 10 or $ 1000. To establish injury in fact under the package measure, any merchant would have to show that in the untied world, he would have 
paid less than $ 1,000. As noted in the text, this will require establishing what both interchange fees would have been in the 
untied world, i.e., the fee on credit cards would have been "" "" and the fee on off-line debit cards would have been "" "". To assess the effect of different price combinations on the merchant ""whose debit-card sales predominate,"" let us say that for 
every 100 transactions, he processes 30 by credit and 70 by off-line debit. In showing the fact of injury, this merchant could 
select (if provable) combinations of "" "" and "" "" that would sum over $ 20, thus obviating the need to make ""'elusive and seldom 
attempted'"" showing that ""the sum of tying and tied product prices would have been lower"" absent the tie. In re VisaCheck / 
Mastermoney Antitrust Litig., 192 F.R.D. at 85 (quoting X Areeda et al., supra P 1769b, at 429). For example, if C = $ 19 and D = 
$ 5, then C + D would be $ 24 but this merchant would have been injured in fact by $ 150 (30 x $ 19 + 70 x $ 4 = $ 570 + $ 280 
= $ 850). In terms of the extent of his injury, the 30%/70% merchant would greatly prefer a theory positing that C would have been $ 16 
and D would have been $ 3 to a theory that the prices would have been $ 10 and $ 9, even though in both cases the sum would 
be $ 19. He could recover $ 310 under the former version of events (30 x $ 16 + 70 x $ 3 = $ 690), but only $ 70 under the latter 
(30 x $ 10 + 70 x $ 9 = $ 930). "
1894,7," By plugging in the hypothetical prices of credit and debit discussed in the previous footnote, it is easy to see how the interests 
of this merchant differ from those of the merchant whose debit sales predominate. For every 100 transactions, this merchant 
processes 50 credit sales and 50 debit sales. If C would have been $ 19 and D $ 4, this merchant would actually have paid more 
in the untied world then he did under the tie (50 x $ 19 + 50 x $ 4 = $ 1,150). In the words of the district court, he ""would have 
benefitted from [the tie] to the extent it kept credit card interchange fees down."" In re VisaCheck / Mastermoney Antitrust Litig., 
192 F.R.D. at 83. And while the respective prices of credit and debit mattered a great deal to 30%/70% merchant in showing the extent of injury, 
they would not matter at all to the 50%/50% merchant. The latter would recover $ 50 by advancing an economic theory that the 
prices would have been $ 16 and $ 3 (50 x $ 16 + 50 x $ 3 = $ 950) or $ 10 and $ 9 (50 x $ 10 + 50 x $ 9 = $ 950). The 
50%/50% merchant could make a disinterested determination of which of the two theories would be easier to prove."
1894,8," Assume that this merchant processed 70 credit transactions for every 30 debit sales. If decoupling would have resulted in 
prices of $ 19 and $ 4, then this merchant would have been hurt by a whopping $ 450 (70 x $ 19 + 30 x $ 4 = $ 1,450). He also 
would have been hurt if the prices had been $ 16 and $ 3 (70 x $ 16 + 30 x $ 3 = $ 1,210) or even $ 16 and $ 0 because 70 x $ 
16 is more than $ 1000. On the other hand, if the prices were $ 10 and $ 9, he could recover $ 30 (70 x $ 10 + 30 x $ 9 = $ 970), 
placing his preferences directly at odds with the preferences of the 30/70 merchant (who preferred the $ 16 and $ 3 prices to the 
$ 10 and $ 9). By extension, a merchant whose ratio of credit to off-line debit transactions was extremely high would not be able 
to recover under any theory positing a credit card fee of over $ 10 unless the debit card fee became virtually a free good. "
1899,1," Plaintiffs do not have extensive records of such transactions, however, [a]n antitrust plaintiff need not alleged specific 
transactions in the complaint . . ., a 'general description of the conduct and practices at issue' will suffice."" National Ass'n of

1900,3," Defendants, relying on the case of Mountain View Pharmacy v. Abbott Laboratories, 630 F.2d 1383 (10th Cir. 1980), argue that 
the Amended Complaint is inadequate because it does not demonstrate discriminatory sales by a mutual supplier to a plaintiff 
and defendant. Defendants reliance on Mountain View, however, is to no avail. There, the court held that ""a complaint drafted 
only in terms of the statutory language in a case involving thirteen plaintiffs alleging Sherman Act and Robinson-Patman Act 
violations by twenty-eight defendants cannot satisfy Rule 8(a)(2). Id. at 1387. The Mountain View court found that the 
complaint [*13]  ""furnishe[d] not the slightest clue"" as to the what conduct that plaintiff's claimed violated the antitrust laws in that 
""[i]t failed to specify any products that were the subject of the discriminatory treatment [or] identify the favored purchasers of a 
particular product. Id. at 1388. Here, as is outlined above, the proposed Amended Complaint is more than sufficient to place the 
defendants on notice of the nature of the claims against them. "
1901,4," Notwithstanding the thoroughness of the proposed Amended Complaint, we note that courts have held that ""even a complaint 
that fails to allege an element of an antitrust claim may be adequate."" Donson Stores, Inc. v. American Bakeries Co., 58 F.R.D. 
485, 487-88 (S.D.N.Y. 1973) (Robinson-Patman Act claim not dismissed despite its failure to allege lessening of competition). "
1903,5," The question of whether a plaintiff is an ""indirect purchaser"" is not always a simple [*21]  one. Accordingly, we think that 
discovery will aid in identifying which, if any, of the plaintiffs qualify as ""indirect purchasers"" under Illinois Brick. See In re 
Mercedes-Benz Antitrust Litigation, 157 F. Supp.2d 355, 366 (D. N.J. 2001). "

1987,2," The most notable departure from standard antitrust analysis is the treatment of any economic loss to the customer of a 
discriminating seller as injury to competition (so-called ""secondary line"" injury).  FTC v. Morton Salt Co., 334 U.S. 37, 46, 92 L. 
Ed. 1196, 68 S. Ct. 822 (1948). By contrast, where a competing seller is the plaintiff (a so-called ""primary line"" injury case), 
evidence of an actual threat to competition--not just economic loss to the disadvantaged seller--is required.  Brooke Group Ltd.

phrase modifies, has been less forgiving. See  Quality Bakers of America v. FTC, 114 F.2d 393, 398-99 (1st Cir. 1940).

1988,5," Because the suggestion came too late and without any justification, we need not consider whether it also may be barred

1998,4," The Court held that neither act of state nor foreign sovereign compulsion applied, because the grant of patents was not

in its conduct of international affairs. See 595 F.2d at 1294."
1998,5," The Supreme Court reasoned that a foreign party subject to compulsion was in an advantageous position to plead with its 
sovereign for relaxation of penal laws or for adoption of plans to achieve significant compliance with American law. See  Societe

1999,6," Indeed, Canada and the United States have already exchanged a series of diplomatic communications relating to this case. In

2041,4," Given that this matter comes before us on demurrer, the facts we recite are those alleged in plaintiffs' third amended complaint,

2042,5," Specifically, plaintiffs set forth (in par. 23 of their current pleading) the creation and existence of the alleged conspiracy in the 
following terms: ""[T]he Insurer Defendants, and each of them, engaged together in a common scheme and civil conspiracy to 
unlawfully coerce certain consumers of automobile liability insurance, who owned more than one vehicle to be so insured, to 
purchase more [uninsured motorist] coverage than what the purchaser desired, by refusing to sell said purchaser any [uninsured 
motorist] coverage at all unless said coverage applied to all of said purchaser's insured vehicles."""
2042,6," In their complaint, plaintiffs alleged that they were representatives of the class of insureds adversely impacted by this common 
and agreed-to business practice of the defendant insurers. To support their claim to the status of ""representative"" plaintiffs, the 
complaint alleges the following: (1) the plaintiff Smith, although desiring uninsured motorist coverage on only one of her vehicles, 
was required by State Farm, as a condition to the purchase of uninsured motorist coverage on the first vehicle, to pay for 
uninsured motorist coverage on her other two vehicles; (2) the plaintiff Armendariz, although desiring uninsured motorist 
coverage on only one of his vehicles, was required by Colonial Penn, as a condition for purchasing uninsured motorist coverage 
on the first vehicle, to pay for uninsured motorist coverage on his other vehicle as well; (3) the plaintiff Grace, although desiring 
uninsured motorist coverage on only three of her six vehicles, was required by the Auto Club, as a condition for purchasing 
uninsured motorist coverage for those three vehicles, to purchase uninsured motorist coverage on the other three; (4) the 
plaintiff Seiling, although desiring uninsured motorist coverage on only one of her vehicles, was required by defendant Farmers, 
as a condition for purchasing uninsured motorist coverage on the first vehicle, also to pay for uninsured motorist coverage on the 
second vehicle; and (5) the plaintiff Mossanen, although desiring uninsured motorist coverage on only two of her three vehicles, 
was required by defendant Mercury, as a condition for purchasing uninsured motorist coverage on those two vehicles, to pay for 
uninsured motorist coverage on the third as well."
2042,7," Unless otherwise indicated, all statutory references are to the Insurance Code."
2042,8," Subdivision (m) of section 11580.2 provides that HN3[
] the insurer must offer uninsured motorist coverage with limits equal 
to the bodily injury liability coverage in the underlying policy. "
2043,9," The agreement to delete uninsured motorist coverage for damage caused by an uninsured motor vehicle completely, or to 
delete uninsured motorist coverage when a motor vehicle is operated by a natural person or persons designated by name, must 
be in the following form: HN6[
] "" 'The California Insurance Code requires an insurer to provide uninsured motorists coverage in each bodily injury 
liability insurance policy it issues covering liability arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle. Those 
provisions also permit the insurer and the applicant to delete the coverage completely or to delete the coverage when a motor 
vehicle is operated by a natural person or persons designated by name. Uninsured motorists coverage insures the insured, his 
or her heirs, or legal representatives for all sums within the limits established by law, which the person or persons are legally 
entitled to recover as damages for bodily injury, including any resulting sickness, disease, or death, to the insured from the 
owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle not owned or operated by the insured or a resident of the same household. An 
uninsured motor vehicle includes an underinsured motor vehicle as defined in subdivision (p) of Section 11580.2 of the 
Insurance Code.' "" (§ 11580.2, subd. (a)(2), italics added.) The agreement to provide uninsured motorist coverage in an amount less than that required by subdivision (m) of section 
11580.2 must be in the following form: HN7[
] "" 'The California Insurance Code requires an insurer to provide uninsured motorists coverage in each bodily injury 
liability insurance policy it issues covering liability arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle. Those 
provisions also permit the insurer and the applicant to agree to provide the coverage in an amount less than that required by 
subdivision (m) of Section 11580.2 of the Insurance Code but not less than the financial responsibility requirements. Uninsured 
motorists coverage insures the insured, his or her heirs, or legal representatives for all sums within the limits established by law, 
which the person or persons are legally entitled to recover as damages for bodily injury, including any resulting sickness, 
disease, or death, to the insured from the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle not owned or operated by the insured 
or a resident of the same household. An uninsured motor vehicle includes an underinsured motor vehicle as defined in 
subdivision (p) of Section 11580.2 of the Insurance Code.' "" (§ 11580.2, subd. (a)(3), italics added.) "
2044,10," In its order, the trial court stated: ""The Court has determined that Insurance Code section 11580.2 does not authorize deletion 
of otherwise mandatory uninsured motorist cover age except in the manner set forth therein and deletion of uninsured motorist 
coverage 'by car' is not authorized by the statute. Plaintiffs have failed to adequately allege an unlawful conspiracy between and 
among the defendants either under the Cartwright Act or otherwise. Plaintiffs have been given three successive opportunities to 
amend and it now appears that they are unable to allege sufficiently the elements of a valid cause of action, hence the 
Demurrers are sustained without leave to further amend."""
2044,11," There was an effort to provide evidence of such fact by a request to the trial court to take judicial notice of the contents of the 
actual policies issued to some of the representative plaintiffs. However, plaintiffs objected and such request was denied. The 
written requests for such judicial notice are in the appellate record and defendants argue that the trial court should have 
considered them. We believe, however, that the trial court was correct in limiting its ruling on the demurrer to the allegations of 
plaintiffs' third amended complaint. The contents of actual policies issued to the representative plaintiffs may certainly be 
considered in connection with any motions for summary adjudication or judgment that may be brought following remand. "
2045,12," This argument is joined in by defendant insurers Auto Club, Farmers, Safeco and USAA."
2045,13, Section 11580.2 as passed in 1959 was repealed and reenacted in 1961 with certain modifications not pertinent here. 
2047,14," For sake of clarity, HN15[
] it should be noted that an ""uninsured motor vehicle"" for purposes of determining uninsured 
motorist coverage does not include any motor vehicle owned or operated by the named insured or any resident of the same 
household. (§ 11580.2, subd. (b)(2).) Thus, the negligent uninsured motorist in the above described example necessarily refers 
to some third party motorist whose negligence resulted in an accident involving the son's vehicle."
2047,15," The court in Cancilla also observed that section 11580.2, subdivision (b), was amended in 1989 to include the language that 
appears to limit the definition to subdivision (b) (""As used in this subdivision, 'insured motor vehicle' means . . . ."") (§ 11580.2, 
subd. (b), italics added.) However, case law prior to 1989 expressly held that subdivision (b) applied to subdivision (c)(6). ( 
Hartford Casualty Ins. Co. v. Cancilla, supra, 28 Cal. App. 4th at p. 1313.) The court then held that subdivision (b) ""is a 
compendium of definitions of terms used in the statute and no substantive change was intended by the amendment."" ( Cansilla, 
supra, 28 Cal. App. 4th at p. 1313.) The Legislative Counsel's Digest noted that, "" 'This bill would restate existing provisions of 
law . . . and would not make any substantive change in the law.' "" (Ibid., italics omitted.) The 1989 amendment, in other words, 
amounted to nothing more than ""routine code maintenance"" and therefore could not be held to alter the prior law. (Ibid.) Thus, 
the language of the statute makes clear that uninsured motorist coverage applies only to the vehicle(s) listed in the policy. "
2048,16," These insurers argue in their briefs that the individual policies actually sold to certain of the representative plaintiffs were 
subject to the waiver allowed under section 11580.2, subdivision (a)(l) and, where requested, such waivers were accomplished. 
However, the formal evidence supporting such claims is not before us. It is included in requests for judicial Notice that were not 
considered by the trial court in light of the fact that the attack on plaintiffs' complaint was by demurrer."
2048,17," It is true that section 11580.2, subdivision (a)(1), requires that any waiver of uninsured motorist coverage be accomplished by 
an ""agreement in writing."" The defendant insurers, however, make no contention that they have any bargaining rights in the 
matter or that a liability insurer is entitled to withhold its ""agreement"" to an insured's request for such a waiver."
2048,18," For example, in 1968, in section 660, subdivision (a) (relating to cancellation of or failure to renew, an automobile insurance 
policy), the Legislature defined a ""policy"" as an ""automobile liability, automobile physical damage, or automobile collision policy, 
or any combination thereof, delivered or issued for delivery in this state, insuring a single individual or individuals residing in the 
same household, as named insured, and under which the insured vehicles therein designated are of the following types only: [list 
of vehicle types omitted]"" (Italics added.) "
2049,19," Business and Professions Code section 17203 provides: HN18[
] ""Any person who engages, has engaged, or proposes to 
engage in unfair competition may be enjoined in any court of competent jurisdiction. The court may make such orders or 
judgments, including the appointment of a receiver, as may be necessary to prevent the use or employment by any person of 
any practice which constitutes unfair competition, as defined in this chapter, or as may be necessary to restore to any person in 
interest any money or property, real or personal, which may have been acquired by means of such unfair competition."" (Italics 
added.)"
2049,20," We emphasize the word ""alleged"" here because of the troubling presence in the record of material (which, on review of a 
demurrer, we do not consider) that strongly suggests this claim against State Farm, Farmers and Allstate is simply not true and 
cannot be proven because the actual practice of those insurers is just the opposite. This, of course, is a matter that must be 
addressed in different proceedings following remand. "
2050,21," ""In Sperry, the Supreme Court said: HN21[
] 'The [Federal Trade] Commission has described the factors it considers in 
determining whether a practice that is neither in violation of the antitrust laws nor deceptive is nonetheless unfair: [P] ""(1) 
whether the practice, without necessarily having been previously considered unlawful, offends public policy as it has been 
established by statutes, the common law, or otherwise--whether, in other words, it is within at least the penumbra of some 
common-law, statutory, or other established concept of unfairness; (2) whether it is immoral, unethical, oppressive, or 
unscrupulous; (3) whether it causes substantial injury to consumers (or competitors or other businessmen)."" ' ( FTC v. Sperry & 
Hutchinson Co., supra, 405 U.S. at pp. 244-245, fn. 5 [31 L. Ed. 2d at p. 179].)"" ( State Farm, supra, 45 Cal. App. 4th at p. 1104, 
fn. 6.)"
2050,22," As one court put it a number of years ago, "" '[T]he Legislature . . . intended by this sweeping language to permit tribunals to 
enjoin on-going wrongful business conduct in whatever context such activity might occur. Indeed, . . . the section was 
intentionally framed in its broad, sweeping language, precisely to enable judicial tribunals to deal with the innumerable ' ""new 
schemes which the fertility of man's invention would contrive."" ' [Citation.] . . . [P] . . . Given the creative nature of the scheming 
mind, the Legislature evidently concluded that a less inclusive standard would not be adequate."" ( Barquis v. Merchants 
Collection Assn., supra, 7 Cal. 3d at pp. 111-112, fn. omitted.) ""[I]t would be impossible to draft in advance detailed plans and 
specifications of all acts and conduct to be prohibited [citations], since unfair or fraudulent business practices may run the gamut 
of human ingenuity and chicanery."" ( People ex rel. Mosk v. National Research Co. of Cal. (1962) 201 Cal. App. 2d 765, 772 [20 
Cal. Rptr. 516].)"
2050,23," It is true that Cel-Tech was critical of the broad characterizations of the ""unfair"" prong of Business and Professions Code 
section 17200, as summarized in appellate cases such as our earlier decision in State Farm. The Cel-Tech court described such 
definitions as ""too amorphous [in that they] provide too little guidance to courts and business."" ( Cel-Tech, supra, 20 Cal. 4th at 
p. 185.) The court made such comment, however, in the context of a dispute between competitors. Indeed, the Cel-Tech court 
concluded by articulating a specific and restrictive definition of ""unfair"" that was to be applied whenever a plaintiff claimed to "
2051,," have suffered injury ""from a direct competitor's 'unfair' act or practice [and the plaintiff has invoked] section 17200 . . . ."" ( Id. at p. 
187, italics added.) The court stated that ""the word 'unfair' [in section 17200] means conduct that threatens an incipient violation 
of an antitrust law, or violates the policy or spirit of one of those laws because its effects are comparable to or the same as a 
violation of the law, or otherwise significantly threatens or harms competition."" (Ibid.) As the court itself acknowledged, we are not to read Cel-Tech as suggesting that such a restrictive definition of ""unfair"" should 
be applied in the case of an alleged consumer injury. The court stated, ""[t]his case involves an action by a competitor alleging 
anticompetitive practices. Our discussion and this test are limited to that context. Nothing we say relates to actions by 
consumers or by competitors alleging other kinds of violations of the unfair competition law such as 'fraudulent' or 'unlawful' 
business practices or 'unfair, deceptive, untrue or misleading advertising.' We also express no view on the application of federal 
cases such as FTC v. Sperry & Hutchinson Co.[, supra,] 405 U.S. 233 . . . that involve injury to consumers and therefore do not 
relate to actions like this one."" ( Cal-Tech, supra, 20 Cal. 4th p. 187, fn. 12.) It would thus appear that the Cel-Tech court's 
comments did not signal a retreat (at least in noncompetitor cases), from its earlier statements in Barquis v. Merchants 
Collection Assn., supra, 7 Cal. 3d at pages 111-112. (See fn. 22, ante.)"
2051,24," Given the increased risk of uninsured motorist liability posed by an insured's use of multiple vehicles, it is not at all clear to us 
just how ""wasteful"" it is to require such coverage on all otherwise insured vehicles. Plaintiffs indicated at oral argument, however, 
that to require them to cover more than one vehicle with uninsured motorist coverage would give them no greater protection for 
bodily injury sustained while either a pedestrian or a passenger in a nonowned vehicle."
2051,25," The defendant insurers point out that plaintiffs failed to comply with the requirements of Business and Professions Code 
section 17209 (requiring them to serve a copy of their brief on the Attorney General of California and the District Attorney of Los 
Angeles County). As they receive no judgment or relief (under Bus. & Prof. Code, § 17200) in this opinion and the matter will be 
remanded for further proceedings, we need not discuss the issue further."
2051,26," HN27[
] The Cartwright Act refers to a ""combination of capital, skill or acts by two or more persons"" for an unlawful purpose. ( Bus. & Prof. Code, § 16720.) This connotes an agreement. A civil conspiracy requires an agreement, express or implied. (See 
Wyatt v. Union Mortgage Co. (1979) 24 Cal. 3d 773, 784 [157 Cal. Rptr. 392, 598 P.2d 45].) "
2053,27," Section 1858 provides: HN30[
] ""(a) Any person aggrieved by any rate charged, rating plan, rating system, or underwriting rule followed or adopted by 
an insurer or rating organization, may file a written complaint with the commissioner requesting that the commissioner review the 
manner in which the rate, plan, system, or rule has been applied with respect to the insurance afforded to that person. In 
addition, the aggrieved person may file a written request for a public hearing before the commissioner, specifying the grounds 
relied upon. ""(b) The commissioner shall advise the insurer or rating organization that a complaint has been filed against it and the nature of 
the complaint and provide the insurer or rating organization with an opportunity to respond to the complaint. ""(c) If the commissioner has information concerning a similar complaint, he or she may deny the request for a public hearing until 
a determination is made or a public hearing is held on the similar complaint or may consolidate similar complaints for 
determination or public hearing. If he or she believes, after review and investigation of the facts alleged in the complaint and the 
facts alleged in any response to the complaint, that probable cause for the complaint does not exist or that the complaint is not 
made in good faith, he or she shall so advise the complainant and shall deny any request made for a public hearing. If he or she 
believes, after review and investigation of the facts alleged in the complaint and the facts alleged in any response to the 
complaint, that probable cause for the complaint does exist, that the complaint charges a violation of this chapter, and that the "
2054,," complainant would be aggrieved if the violation is proven, he or she shall proceed as provided in Section 1858.1 unless the 
complaint was accompanied by a request for public hearing, in which case he or she shall proceed as provided in Section 
1858.2. ""(d) Nothing in this section prohibits or limits the right of any aggrieved person, either prior to or in conjunction with the filing of a 
written complaint with the commissioner under this section, from requesting an insurer or rating organization to review the 
manner in which the rate, plan, system, or rule has been applied with respect to the insurance afforded to that person."" (Italics 
added.)"
2054,28," The defendant insurers also rely on section 1860.1; in addition to that section, the trial court should also examine the impact of 
section 1855.4 with respect to the viability of the exhaustion of administrative remedies argument. (See also Walker v. Allstate 
Indemnity Co. (2000) 77 Cal. App. 4th 750 [92 Cal. Rptr. 2d 132].) "
2055,29," Although plaintiffs claim that their third alleged cause of action is for fraud and constitutes a separate claim, we disagree. The 
allegations actually do nothing but restate plaintiffs' basic claim that the defendant insurers have entered into a conspiracy. We 
therefore have treated the allegations of that count as essentially part of the first two causes of action and no further or different 
discussion is required. "
