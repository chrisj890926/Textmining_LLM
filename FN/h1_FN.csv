'strong federal policy' favoring arbitration."") (citing WorldCrisa Corp. v. Armstrong, 129 F.3d 71, 76 (2d Cir. 1997)). The MLB

35,2," Teva's bar date was April 1, 2009, while Impax's was October 1, 2009. "
36,3," Neither Teva nor Impax have received FDA approval to manufacture their own generic Adderall XR, so Shire remains the sole 
supplier."
36,4," In  [**7] the case of the Teva agreement, LWD highlights a statement from a Shire employee to a Teva employee admitting that 
the breach was a result of Shire's senior management's decision to keep more product for itself."
36,5," LWD asserts in the complaint that, in a breach of contract suit brought by Impax, Shire asserted that  [**8] the lack of supply 
was caused by the Drug Enforcement Administration's failure to set a high enough quota for Adderall XR pills, thus allowing 
Shire to reasonably allocate the supply. In rebuttal, LWD asserts that 1) the DEA itself has rejected this explanation for the 
product shortage, 2) even if the shortage was DEA-created, Shire could not allocate the pill supply, and 3) even if Shire could 
allocate the pill supply, it did not do so reasonably. "
37,6," Some Second Circuit precedent suggests a higher standard for antitrust cases. See George Haug Co. v. Rolls Royce Motor 
Cars Inc., 148 F.3d 136, 139 (2d Cir. 1998) (""In  [**10] antitrust cases in particular, the Supreme Court has stated that 
'dismissals prior to giving the plaintiff ample opportunity for discovery should be granted very sparingly.'"" (quoting Hospital Bldg. 
Co. v. Trustees of Rex Hosp., 425 U.S. 738, 746, 96 S. Ct. 1848, 48 L. Ed. 2d 338 (1976))). But these cases predate Iqbal and 
Twombly, and, moreover are inapposite here because they are largely animated by concerns regarding allegations of an 
antitrust conspiracy, where ""proof is largely in the hands of the alleged conspirators."" Hospital Bldg. Co., 425 U.S. at 746 
(internal quotation marks omitted). Plaintiff does not allege an antitrust conspiracy in this case. See also Daniel v. American 
Bd. of Emergency Med., 988 F. Supp. 112, 122-23 (W.D.N.Y. 1997) (""[B]ecause of the conspiratorial nature of certain antitrust 
claims, 'dismissals prior to giving the plaintiff ample opportunity for discovery should be granted very sparingly.'"") (emphasis 
added) (citation omitted). "
43,1," PeopleBrowsr also argues that its unfair acts sub-claim, even if based on federal law, is paired with an unlawful acts sub-claim 
that is based on state law and that the complaint  [*5] only seeks state law remedies. See Mot. to Remand 12-14, 19. As the 
Court finds removal based on the unfair acts sub-claim inappropriate regardless of the unlawful acts sub-claim or remedy 
sought, it need not separately consider these arguments. "
45,2," The test for an unfair act under the UCL suggests that federal jurisdiction might not attach even if the unfair act is threatens an 
incipient violation of or violates the policy or spirit of a federal antitrust law. The question of what constitutes  [*12] an ""incipient 
violation"" of a law or a violation of ""the policy or spirit"" of a law under section 17200 does not involve a pure question of federal 
law but is infused with the application of an element of state law (e.g., having to define what constitutes an ""incipient violation"" or 
violation of the spirit or policy of the law). Indeed, the UCL permits a plaintiff to bring a UCL claim before a federal claim even 
accrues."
45,3," Indeed, it is not uncommon for alleged facts supporting state law claims, such as claims for employment discrimination, civil 
rights violations, or certain anti-competitive conduct, to give rise to both state as well as federal claims; yet federal question 
jurisdiction does not automatically obtain when the plaintiff asserts only state law claims. "

(Count V). (Dkt. 127 at 38-49)"
52,10," Defendants also note that if Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs sought to certify subgroups within the class, the subgroup of lens 
casters would not satisfy numerosity. (Dkt. 452 at 16) However, this issue need not be addressed as Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs 
do not seek certification of subgroups, and the Court does not find it necessary to recommend that approach. "

of varying fact patterns which underlie the individual claims."")."
54,14," Although Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs maintain that the Court previously rejected Defendants' arguments about potential 
conflicts between class representatives and class members in a prior discovery order (Dkt. 442 at 16 (citing Dkt. 225 at 6-8)), the 
Court ruled only that Defendants had failed at that point to produce evidence of any conflicts to warrant downstream discovery."
54,15," Defendants do not challenge the second prong of the adequacy element, whereby Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs assert that the 
class representatives are actively involved in the case and represented by counsel who are experienced in complex antitrust 
litigation. (Dkt. 442 at 15-16) "

their ""technologies would mesh."" (Dkt. 434 at 130)"
55,18," In Brinker, the court rejected a challenge to adequacy where defendants offered no more than ""unsupported assertion[s]"" that 
some class members benefited. Brinker, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44503, 2012 WL 1081182 at *2."
55,19," Concededly, Defendants' expert, Dr. Leonard, testified that he did not examine the data to determine whether any lens caster 
benefited from the exclusivity agreements. (Dkt. 434 at 120-21) However, the focus of Dr. Leonard's testimony and of Plaintiffs' 
expert, Dr. Singer, was whether Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs have a workable method of showing antitrust  [*31] impact on lens 
casters, and in turn, on the proposed class as a whole. "
57,20," Under a rigid standard requiring impact on each class member, Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs observe that a potential defendant 
could defeat class certification by charging lower  [*34] prices to a single class member, while thousands of others pay higher 
prices due to unlawful anticompetitive conduct. (Dkt. 434 at 19) While acknowledging the logic underlying that assertion, the 
Court cannot ignore the binding case law of this circuit."

59,25," The exclusions were observations that showed up solely in the price card data, not in the corresponding transactional data. Dr. 
Singer theorized that these data points represented sales that were never consummated. (Dkt. 434 at 61, 93)"
59,26," Dr. Singer testified that Transitions had alerted him in a letter dated May 14, 2012 that some of the information incorporated in 
the transactional data was inaccurate for the years 2002 to 2004. However, along with the letter, Transitions provided corrected 
data. Even so, Dr. Singer explained that he did not attempt to integrate the corrections and use transactional data because the 
process would have been too time-consuming, and his class certification report was due on June 15, 2012. Defendants explain 
that the abnormalities in the transactional data affected only the coding, not the prices reported. They maintain that Dr. Singer 
avoided transactional data because it did not provide the results he needed for the lens casters."
59,27," See also In re Hydrogen Peroxide Antitrust Litig., 552 F.3d 305, 314 (3d Cir. 2008) (questioning plaintiffs' use of ""price-
increase announcements"" to show antitrust impact); In re Wholesale Grocery Prods. Antitrust Litig., No. 09-MD-2090 ADM/AJB,

could not establish connection between price-increase announcements and prices paid by customers)."
59,28," Dr. Singer defended his use of a 50 percent significance level because that standard ""more closely corresponds to what I 
understand to be the plaintiff's civil burden."" (Dkt. 434 at 52) Putting aside the question of whether a 50 percent margin meets 
the preponderance of evidence standard in civil cases (if that is what Dr. Singer was referring to), use of that percentage in 
 [*45] regression analysis to prove common impact is troubling. "
60,29," Dr. Leonard testified that Dr. Singer's standard is ""completely inconsistent with the way economists do things"" and that if one 
surveyed journal articles over the past fifty years, ""you'd be very hard-pressed to find anybody who used a 50 percent 
significance level."" (Dkt. 434 at 109)"
60,30," Although the exact percentage is redacted from Dr. Leonard's report (Dkt. 453 at 148) along with an entire column of data, 
Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs cite the exact percentage without redaction in their reply brief. (Dkt. 443 at 11) The figure was also 
testified to by Dr. Singer in a courtroom that was open to the public. (Dkt. 434 at 50-51, 54)"
60,31," Dr. Leonard's analysis did not end after applying the 5 percent significance level. He then made a series of adjustments to 
correct what he saw as errors in Dr. Singer's approach and ultimately concluded that 0 percent of the transactions were 
impacted by Defendants' exclusivity agreements. (Dkt. 453 at 148) "
76,1," The Supreme Court has explained: The varying circumstances of each case determine the result. In considering what is the relevant market for determining the 
control of price and competition, no more definite rule can be declared than that commodities reasonably interchangeable 
by consumers for the same purposes make up that ""part of the trade or commerce,"" monopolization of which may be illegal. United States v. E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 351 U.S. 377, 394-95, 76 S. Ct. 994, 100 L. Ed. 1264 (1956). "
79,2," The Seventh Circuit has also noted that ""[o]ne of the threshold criteria that a plaintiff must satisfy under both the per se and rule 
of reason analyses in order to show that such an extension of the seller's market power may pose a threat of economic harm 
and an unlawful restraint of trade is that there is a substantial danger that the tying seller will acquire market power in the tied 
product market."" Carl Sandburg, 758 F.2d at 210 (citing Jefferson Parish Hosp., 466 U.S. at 38-39 (O'Connor, J., concurring in 
the judgment)). It is not clear whether this is an additional element in our circuit: early decisions avoided the question, see, e.g., 
Parts & Elec. Motors, Inc. v. Sterling Elec., Inc., 826 F.2d 712, 718 (7th Cir. 1987) (noting that previous pronouncements on this 
principal appeared to be dicta and that a requirement of a threat of market power in the tied market has not been endorsed by a 
majority of the Supreme Court), and it was not  [*29] mentioned in more recent tying decisions such as Reifert or Sheridan v. 
Marathon Petroleum Co. LLC, 530 F.3d 590 (2008). In any event, the question is premature at this point because Gumwood has 
alleged that Simon has in fact obtained (or retained) market power in the relevant tied market. "
82,3," See Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law: An Analysis of Antitrust Principles and Their Application ¶ 651i 
(3d ed. 2007) (discussing the relationship between Section 1 and Section 2 claims and noting that a tying violation under Section 
1 that affects only a small percentage of sales in the tied market may not significantly impair the opportunities of rivals in that 
market and therefore may not always give rise to a monopolization claim under Section 2). "
84,1, The Court finds the matter appropriate for decision without oral argument. Fed R. Civ. P. 78; L. R. 7-15. 
95,1," In Plaintiff's opposition papers, he appears to have added several new facts to those alleged in the SAC, or at least he has 
added additional details to certain allegations. (Pl. Mem. in Opp. to Fannie Mae Mot. to Dismiss 2 (making certain additional 
allegations regarding the primary real estate transaction at issue).) When determining a motion to dismiss for failure  [**3] to 
state a claim, a court is confined to the facts as pleaded in the complaint and any permissible attachments, and a court should 
not consider new facts alleged in moving papers. See CFAA Civic Ctr. Motors, Ltd. v. Mason St. Imp. Cars, Ltd., 387 F. Supp. 2d 
378, 382 (S.D.N.Y. 2005) (refusing to consider new damages allegations alleged in moving papers and not in the plaintiff's 
complaint). Nonetheless, the outcome here would not change were the Court to consider the additional facts in pro se Plaintiff's 
opposition papers. "
96,2," Plaintiff's SAC also appears at first glance to state a claim for violations of the Federal Trade Commission Act and 18 U.S.C. § 
1346, the federal honest services mail fraud statute, (SAC ¶¶ 26-27), but he concedes there is no private right of action under 
either of those provisions and has converted them to claims under New York General Business Law §§ 349 and 350, (SAC ¶¶ 
26(a), 27(a)); accord Washington v. U.S. Tennis Ass'n, 290 F. Supp. 2d 323, 329 (E.D.N.Y. 2003) (""[T]he Federal Trade 
Commission Act . . . does not create a private right of action for damages.""). "
99,3," Plaintiff also brings a state law antitrust claim under the Donnelly Act. (SAC ¶ 22(a).) This claim must be dismissed for the 
same reasons as the federal claim. See X.L.O. Concrete Corp. v. Rivergate Corp., 83 N.Y.2d 513, 634 N.E.2d 158, 161, 611 
N.Y.S.2d 786 (N.Y. 1994) (Donnelly Act ""should generally be construed in light of Federal precedent"" (internal quotation marks 
omitted)); see also Kramer v. Pollock-Krasner Found., 890 F. Supp. 250, 254 (S.D.N.Y. 1995) (holding that because the New 
York courts interpret New York antitrust laws essentially in parity with federal antitrust law, the court ""analyze[d] the Sherman 
and Donnelly Act claims together""). "
101,4," Further, it appears that Fannie Mae did not actually receive any TARP funds from the Federal Government. (Fannie Mae Mem. 
at 11 n.7) (citing Fed'l Nat'l Mortgage Ass'n, Annual Report (Form 10-K), at 34 (Feb. 29, 2012)). Even though the Court probably 
could judicially notice this fact, it is irrelevant, because Plaintiff's claim fails for other, independent reasons. "
103,5," Initially, Plaintiff's fifth cause of action claimed Defendants violated the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 41-58, 
and his sixth cause of action claimed Defendants violated the ""Honest Services Doctrine as enacted by Congress in 1988,"" 
which is codified at 18 U.S.C. § 1346. (SAC ¶¶ 26, 27.) However, Plaintiff has voluntarily withdrawn those claims after conceding 
that neither statute contains a private right of action. (SAC ¶¶ 26(a), 27(a).)"
103,6," The breach of fiduciary duty claims are against only the Realtor Defendants, New York residents who are not diverse from 
Plaintiff, which means this Court has no diversity jurisdiction. See 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a)(1) (granting federal courts diversity 
jurisdiction in cases ""between . . . citizens of different States"" where the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000). The Court 
also does not have diversity jurisdiction over the state-law  [**35] deceptive practices claims because, even though Fannie Mae 
appears to be implicated by this claim, so too are the Realtor Defendants, and the Supreme Court has long ""read the statutory 
formulation 'between . . . citizens of different States' to require complete diversity between all plaintiffs and all defendants."" 
Lincoln Prop. Co. v. Roche, 546 U.S. 81, 89, 126 S. Ct. 606, 163 L. Ed. 2d 415 (2005) (citation omitted). Thus, this Court has no 
original jurisdiction to adjudicate either claim. "
104,7," The Court wishes to make Plaintiff aware that various statutes of limitations may impose a time limit on his ability to refile the 
state law claims in New York state court, should he wish to continue pursuing these claims. In the event that the statutes of 
limitations have run on any of the claims, federal law provides that Plaintiff has at least 30 days to refile the claims in state court. 
See 28 U.S.C. § 1367(d) (""The period of limitations for any claim asserted under subsection (a) [of § 1367], and for any other 
claim in the same action that is voluntarily dismissed at the same time as or after the dismissal of the claim under subsection (a), 
shall be tolled while the claim is pending and for a period of 30 days after it is dismissed unless State law provides for a longer 
tolling period.""). Some states extend that time period, and it appears that New York has taken advantage of that and given 
plaintiffs six months from the time of dismissal in federal court to refile in state court. See N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 205 (""If an action is 
timely commenced and is terminated in any other manner than by a voluntary discontinuance, a failure to obtain personal 
jurisdiction over  [**38] the defendant, a dismissal of the complaint for neglect to prosecute the action, or a final judgment upon 
the merits, the plaintiff, or, if the plaintiff dies, and the cause of action survives, his or her executor or administrator, may 
commence a new action upon the same transaction or occurrence or series of transactions or occurrences within six months 
after the termination provided that the new action would have been timely commenced at the time of commencement of the prior 
action and that service upon defendant is effected within such six-month period.""); see also Murray v. Visiting Nurse Servs. of 
N.Y., 528 F. Supp. 2d 257, 281 (S.D.N.Y. 2007) (explaining the operation of 28 U.S.C. § 1367(d) and N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 205). The 
Court wishes to stress, however, that Plaintiff should not affirmatively rely on the Court's brief survey of the law in this area, and 
Plaintiff must conduct his own inquiry to determine the time in which he may refile his claims in state court."
104,8," Plaintiff has now submitted three complaints, and, as explained in this Opinion, ""the third is no closer to the first in stating a 
claim . . . upon which relief could be granted."" Williams, 491 F. Supp. 2d at 328. Indeed, the Court is quite familiar with Plaintiff's 
claims, because, in addition to having read the various filings, the Court has conducted two pre-motion conferences where 
Plaintiff was given the opportunity to elaborate on his factual claims and his legal arguments. (See Unnumbered Dkt. Entries of 
January 25, 2012 and April 2, 2012.) Now, more than three years have passed since Plaintiff filed his initial Complaint, and it is 
clear that ""the facts that plaintiff has pled are inconsistent with a [federal claim] . . ., so that the complaint's deficiencies are not 
subject to cure."" Williams, 491 F. Supp. 2d at 328. Accordingly, the Court has discretion to dismiss the federal claims without 
giving Plaintiff yet another chance to amend. See id.; see also Fulton v. Goord, 591 F.3d 37, 45 (2d Cir. 2009) (""We are normally 
accommodating to motions for leave to amend pro se complaints, but may deny them 'when amendment  [**40] would be futile.""' 
(quoting Tocker v. Philip Morris Cos., 470 F.3d 481, 491 (2d Cir. 2006) (internal citation omitted)). "
107,1," Beyond the customary round of initial, response, and reply briefs, Defendant has requested leave to file a surreply in response 
to Plaintiff's reply brief. Because the issues before the Court are fairly straightforward, and because Plaintiff's reply brief does not 
raise any new arguments or unduly expand upon the contentions advanced in Plaintiff's initial brief and addressed in 
Defendant's response brief, the Court finds no basis for departing from the usual briefing process established under Local Rule 
7.1(e) of this District. "
108,2, The terms appearing in bold are defined elsewhere in the Policy.
108,3," The ""Covered Percentage"" is defined in this endorsement as 80 percent. Defendant's obligation under this endorsement is 
triggered only after Plaintiff satisfies a $1 million retention, and Defendant's liability under this endorsement is limited to $25 
million."
108,4," This is the operative complaint from the Cason-Merenda litigation, because this pleading named Plaintiff Beaumont as a 
defendant for the first time. "
109,5," In the Court's recent summary judgment ruling in Cason-Merenda, the defendant hospitals were awarded summary judgment in 
their favor on the plaintiffs' claim of a per se violation of § 1 of the Sherman Act arising from the defendants' alleged conspiracy 
to depress RN compensation levels, but the plaintiffs were permitted to go forward on their § 1 ""rule of reason"" claim that the 
defendant hospitals had unlawfully agreed among themselves to share compensation information in a manner that harmed 
competition and depressed RN wages.  [*10] See Cason-Merenda, 862 F. Supp.2d at 641, 647-49."
109,6," On April 20, 2012, the Cason-Merenda plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary approval of the settlement reached with Plaintiff. 
This motion was addressed and granted at a hearing held on March 1, 2013, and an order reflecting the Court's approval of the 
settlement is expected to be entered soon. "
110,7," As both parties observe, the Court's review is not strictly limited to the four corners of the parties' pleadings, but also extends to 
exhibits to these pleadings and attachments to the parties' briefs in support of and in opposition to Plaintiff's motion, so long as 
these materials are referenced in the parties' pleadings and are central to the claims and counterclaims asserted in  [*14] this 
suit. See Amini v. Oberlin College, 259 F.3d 493, 502 (6th Cir. 2001). In particular, the Court may consider the insurance policy 
and related materials attached as exhibits to Defendant's answer and counterclaim."
110,8," The parties here evidently agree, at least tacitly, that Michigan law governs this Court's inquiry into the proper interpretation of 
the Policy. "
112,9," The Court notes that throughout its response to Plaintiff's motion, Defendant interchangeably refers to ""disgorgement"" and 
""restitution"" as equally beyond the scope of the coverage  [*24] provided in Endorsement No. 31's definition of ""loss."" (See, e.g., 
Defendant's Response Br. at 23 (arguing that the Cason-Merenda complaint seeks the relief of ""disgorgement/restitution . . . in 
at least two places""). In point of fact, however, this definition of ""loss"" draws a distinction between ""disgorgement by any 
Insured""and ""any amount reimbursed by any Insured Person."" (Policy, Endorsement No. 31, ¶ 6.) The Policy elsewhere 
clarifies that, as one might expect, an ""insured person"" encompasses only individuals, such as the corporate officers and 
directors of an insured organization. (See Policy, Endorsement No. 12.) Thus, even assuming that the reference in Endorsement 
No. 31 to ""reimburse[ment]"" could be construed as encompassing the remedy of restitution, an amount paid by the corporate "
113,," entity itself (here, Plaintiff Beaumont), as opposed to an individual, presumably would be excluded from coverage only if it 
qualified as the remedy of ""disgorgement."" As Defendant acknowledges, the remedies of disgorgement and restitution, while 
perhaps related, nonetheless ""differ somewhat in their focus."" (Defendant's Response Br. at 19 n.50.)"
113,10," The Court notes that in deciding Plaintiff's motion, it may take judicial notice of Dr. Ashenfelter's expert report, which has been 
submitted to the Court and filed on the docket in the related Cason-Merenda litigation. See, e.g., Lyons v. Stovall, 188 F.3d 327, 
332 n.3 (6th Cir. 1999); E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. v. Cullen, 791 F.2d 5, 7 (1st Cir. 1986).  [*28] This judicial notice, of 
course, does not extend to the truth of the matters asserted in Dr. Ashenfelter's report, see Opoka v. I.N.S., 94 F.3d 392, 395 
(7th Cir. 1996), but rather only to the fact of the analytical approach he uses to compute the damages suffered by the plaintiff 
class in that case."
113,11," Indeed, as Plaintiff points out, the plaintiffs in Cason-Merenda seek to hold the defendant hospitals ""jointly and severally"" liable 
for the damages they allegedly suffered. (Cason-Merenda v. Detroit Medical Center, No. 06-15601, Third Corrected Class Action 
Complaint, Prayer for Relief ¶ C.) Thus, if the plaintiffs were to prevail on their § 1 antitrust conspiracy claim, they could choose 
to collect the entirety of the judgment from Plaintiff or some other defendant hospital alone, and this defendant would have no 
recourse under antitrust law to seek contribution from any other co-defendant hospital. See Texas Industries, Inc. v. Radcliff 
Materials, Inc., 451 U.S. 630, 645-46, 101 S. Ct. 2061, 2069-70, 68 L. Ed. 2d 500 (1981). This belies the notion that Plaintiff 
faces only the disgorgement of its own profit or advantage secured as a result of its participation in the alleged conspiracy. See 
State of Washington v. American Pipe & Construction Co., 280 F. Supp. 802, 805 (S.D. Cal. 1968)  [*29] (observing that an "
114,," antitrust conspirator ""must share the responsibility for any damages proved which were occasioned by the sales of co-
conspirators, even though it may not have directly participated in, or benefited from, such activity"")."
114,12," In light of this conclusion that the Cason-Merenda plaintiffs have not sought the remedy of disgorgement, the Court need not 
weigh in on the parties' debate as to whether this remedy is even available in a private Sherman Act antitrust suit. As Plaintiff 
observes, the authorities cited by Defendant as purportedly establishing the availability of this remedy either address 
governmental enforcement actions, see United States v. Keyspan Corp., 763 F. Supp.2d 633, 638-41 (S.D.N.Y. 2011); In re 
TFT-LCD (Flat Panel) Antitrust Litigation, No. M 07-1827, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 76562, 2011 WL 2790179, at *3-*4 (N.D. Cal. 
July 12, 2011); Phillip E. Areeda et al., Antitrust Law ¶ 325a (3d ed. 2007), or touch upon this topic only in passing, see Black 
v. JP Morgan Chase & Co., No. 10-848, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 99428, 2011 WL 3940236, at *21 (W.D. Pa. Aug. 25, 2011). "
117,13," Defendant also identifies two other factual conflicts in the parties' pleadings, but neither concerns a material fact. First, to the 
extent that Plaintiff alleges (and Defendant denies) that Defendant has acted in bad faith or has failed to properly discharge its 
duties under the Policy, this question of Defendant's good- or bad-faith performance of its contractual duties has played no part 
in the disposition of Plaintiff's motion. Likewise, to the extent that the parties dispute whether Plaintiff has been permitted to 
control its own defense and settlement negotiations in the course of the Cason-Merenda litigation, this issue also is immaterial to 
the Court's resolution of Plaintiff's motion."
117,14," Indeed, a copy of this agreement is attached as an exhibit to Defendant's response. "
125,1," Although plaintiffs provide excerpts of the labels' language in their complaint, the Court finds it easier to read the actual copies 
of the labels as provided by defendants in their exhibits to their motion to dismiss. (See Product Labels, Ex. A.) See Nasso v. Bio 
Reference Labs, Inc., No. 11-cv-3480, 892 F. Supp. 2d 439, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 136554, 2012 WL 4336429, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. 
Sept. 24, 2012) (noting documents a court may consider on a motion to dismiss, including ""'documents 'integral' to the complaint 
and relied upon in it, even if not attached or incorporated  [**6] by reference, [and] documents or information contained in 
defendant's motion papers if plaintiff has knowledge or possession of the material and relied on it in framing the complaint'"" 
(quoting In re Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc., 273 F. Supp. 2d 351, 356-57 (S.D.N.Y. 2003))). "
126,2," In their complaint, plaintiffs reference additional language that they assert appears on certain Ester-C packaging, namely, that 
Ester-C's products provide ""immune protection"" and ""24 Hour Immune Support."" (See FAC ¶ 17.) Defendants counter that no 
such language appears on any of its products (see Defs.' Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss at 10; Defs.' Reply at 1-2), and 
moreover, offer exhibits of actual Ester-C product labels (the accuracy of which plaintiffs do not dispute), none of which contain 
such language (see Product Labels, Ex. A). The Court finds no such plaintiff-referenced language on the products or, for that 
matter, on defendants' website. The cited language instead seems to appear in other, non-Ester-C companies' marketing. Thus, 
the Court does not consider such alleged labeling in its analysis."
126,3," Plaintiffs do not explicitly state in their complaint on what exact dates or at what times they read such labels or visited the Ester-
C website. However, plaintiffs specifically state the language on which they claim to have relied in making their Ester-C 
purchases. (FAC ¶¶ 16-21.) Plaintiffs also allege that they would not have made their purchases if they had not read and relied 
on such statements. (Id. ¶¶ 9, 10.)"
126,4," At oral argument, counsel for defendants made clear that Ester-C Co. is not responsible for the language that other companies 
use to market Ester-C, and noted that in the past, defendants have had to reach out to ask such companies to remove language 
that goes beyond Ester-C's own marketing and labeling representations. (See Oral Arg. Oct. 23, 2012.) "
127,5," Specifically, plaintiffs cite a publication issued by Oregon State University's Linus Pauling Institute in which the effect of Ester-
C's main ingredients, including calcium ascorbate and small amounts of different forms of vitamin C metabolites, was called into 
question. (FAC ¶ 25 n.1 (quoting Oregon State University, Linus Pauling Institute — Micronutrient Information Center, 
http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminC/ (last visited May 4, 2012)) (internal quotation mark omitted))."
127,6," Although defendants argue that plaintiffs fail to sufficiently plead the elements of these torts under California, Missouri, or New 
York law, a review of plaintiffs' complaint makes clear that plaintiffs only allege these torts under New York common law. (See 
FAC Counts V-VII.) Moreover, defendants point to no conflict of law with New York law, such that Missouri or California law 
should be deemed applicable here. (See Defs.' Mot. to Dismiss at 8 n.8.) The Court need not make such a determination at this 
juncture in the litigation. See Patel v. N.Y. Life Ins. Co., No. 11 Civ. 4895 (JPO), 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 72717, 2012 WL 
1883529, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. May 21, 2012) (""Because a choice of law analysis is fact intensive, courts often decline to make a 
choice of law determination at the motion to dismiss stage.""); see also  [**13] In re Merrill Lynch Auction Rate Sec. Litig., 851 F. 
Supp. 2d 512, 541 (S.D.N.Y. 2012 (""The Court need not reach the choice-of-law issue here to decide [defendant's] motion to 
dismiss.""). The Court accordingly limits its analysis as to these issues to New York law and does not, at this stage, make any 
choice of law determination. "
134,7," Plaintiffs also state in their  [**40] opposition to defendants' motion that ""[o]ther studies exist that demonstrate that Ester-C 
cannot perform as advertise[d], and can be added to an amended complaint, if this court deems amendment necessary."" (Pls. 
Opp'n Mot. to Defs' Mot. to Dismiss at 2 n.1.) As plaintiffs do not provide the Court with any such studies in their complaint, these 
alleged studies are beyond the scope of the present motion. The Court does not factor any such additional studies into its 
analysis. "
138,8," Defendants made clear at oral argument that these marketing representations were made independent of Ester-C Co. and 
were not approved by the Company. (Oral Arg. Oct. 23, 2012.) "
140,9," Plaintiffs also contend that defendants have violated the ""unlawful conduct"" prong of the UCL through violations of California's 
Sherman Law, Cal. Health & Safety Code, § 109875, et seq. (FAC ¶¶ 68-69.) Because plaintiffs have adequately pled a violation 
of the ""unlawful conduct"" prong through their pleadings of violations of California's FAL and CLRA, the Court need not address 
whether plaintiffs also violated the UCL's proscription against unlawful conduct due to alleged violations of the Sherman 
 [**64] Law. See Ackerman, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 73156, 2010 WL 2925955, at *18 n.33 (not addressing plaintiff's alternative "
141,," allegation of an ""unlawful conduct"" violation under the UCL through violations of California's Sherman Law because plaintiffs 
already had sufficiently pled a violation of the same prong through their allegations of violations of California's FAL). "
142,10," Although plaintiffs' only express statement of purchasing Ester-C for personal, family, or household use is contained in their 
pleadings as to violations of California's CLRA (see FAC ¶ 53), given the strong similarities across plaintiffs' pleadings, this is 
sufficient for purposes of establishing that plaintiffs' purchase here, whether under California, Missouri, or New York law, was for 
personal, family, or household use. The Court accordingly will overlook the absence of this statement from plaintiffs' Missouri-
specific pleadings. "
145,11," In their motion, defendants cite to Donahue v. Ferolito, Vultaggio & Sons, 13 A.D.3d 77, 786 N.Y.S.2d 153 (1st Dept. 2004), in 
which the court upheld the lower court's dismissal of a fraud claim ""on the ground of failure to demonstrate justifiable reliance on 
misrepresentation."" Id. at 78. The case concerned beverages bearing labels touting the health benefits of the drinks' 
consumption, including improved memory, reduced stress, and improved health. Id. It is unclear what the specific product 
representations were in Donahue, nor is the exact language of the disclaimer clear from the opinion. Additionally, the Donahue 
court, when weighing the appropriateness of dismissal on the fraud claim, gave weight to the ""type of product involved,"" which in 
that case, was herbal iced teas and fruit punch. Id. However, these determinations are case-specific  [**81] and, as noted above, 
the issue of justifiable reliance cannot be resolved in this case at the motion to dismiss stage. "
148,1," The RJN is granted in its entirety. Fed. R. Evid. 201(b)(2); Hite v. Wachovia Mortg., No. 2:09-cv-02884-GEB-GGH, 2010 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 57732, at *6-9 (E.D. Cal. June 10, 2010); Gens v. Wachovia Mortg. Corp., No. CV10-01073 JF (HRL), 2010 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 54932, at *6-7, 2010 WL 1924777 (N.D. Cal. May 12, 2010). "
151,2," In his opposition to this motion, Plaintiff seems allege further RESPA violations. They do not assist him here. Plaintiff lacks 
standing to assert violations of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement (""PSA"") governing the securitized trust holding the loan. 
See Sepehry-Fard v. Aurora Bank FSB, Case No. 5:12-cv-00871 EJD, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12048, at *10-11, 2013 WL 
597788 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 29, 2013). As such, violations of the PSA cannot support any cause of action brought by Plaintiff, let 
alone one under RESPA. Plaintiff also cannot rely on Defendant's purported failure to respond to a Qualified Written Request 
because allegations supporting such a violation are not contained in the Complaint. "
153,3," Plaintiff also argues that amendments to California Civil Code § 2923.5 strengthen his ""claims regarding the failure of 
Defendant to demonstrate that it has the authority from the true owner to take action against Plaintiff."" Based on the allegations 
in the Complaint, however, it is unclear how § 2923.5 applies since Plaintiff does not allege to have defaulted on the loan. "
159,1," Certain counts in the IPFAC are not subject to this motion. The Defendants have not moved to dismiss as time-barred the 
Sherman Act claim or the West Virginia unjust enrichment claim, and the parties agree that the Plaintiffs may not seek damages 
arising before May 1, 2006 under Utah's antitrust statute. "
160,2," The Plaintiffs claim that they may rely on the discovery rules of Arizona, California, the District of Columbia, Iowa, 
Massachusetts, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, South Dakota, Tennessee, 
Vermont, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. See Docket No. 750 at 47."
160,3," These states are Arizona, California, the District of Columbia, Florida, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, 
Mississippi,  [**4] Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, South Dakota, Tennessee, Vermont, and West Virginia. See 
Docket No. 750 at 47-48. Although the Plaintiffs omit Florida from the list of jurisdictions in which the fraudulent concealment 
doctrine precludes dismissal of their claims, see id. at 47, the Court will treat this omission as unintentional, because the 
Plaintiffs have not stipulated to the partial dismissal of their claims arising under Florida law. "
161,4," Notably, the Court has twice granted the Plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint since issuing its 2011 opinion. "
162,5," Under the Plaintiffs' logic, December 11, 2003 also should constitute a tolling date, because a Buffalo News article published 
that day allegedly included an admission by UEP member Scott Kreher that the UEP's certification program was increasing egg 
prices, an admission that placed the Plaintiffs on notice of their claims just as much as (if not more than) the September 21, 
2006 press releases. See Docket No. 794 at ¶ 197. In reality, neither of these days suffices as a tolling date, because the IPFAC 
does not suggest that the Plaintiffs learned of their claims through either the article or the press releases. Given the allegations 
of the IPFAC, the date on which the Plaintiffs discovered their claims remains a mystery. "
163,6," Because of the deficiencies of the IPFAC, the Court need not address the Defendants' argument that the discovery rule cannot 
apply to the Plaintiffs' California and South Dakota claims. "
164,7," Because the IPFAC fails to adequately plead fraudulent concealment, the Court will not address whether Kansas law extends 
the fraudulent concealment doctrine to the Plaintiffs' claims. "
165,8," Although they have not reviewed the statute at issue here, HN11[
] Minnesota courts generally  [**27] interpret state antitrust law consistently with federal law, and the Court's holding achieves this result. See Lorix v. Crompton Corp., 736 N.W.2d 619, 
626 (Minn. 2007) (""Minnesota antitrust law is generally interpreted consistently with federal antitrust law.""). "
170,1," Each Registered Article is appended to the plaintiff's amended complaint. They include stories on a diverse set of subjects, as 
the following examples illustrate: exhibits F (Sri Lankan fruit traders); G (Casino jobs in Ohio); H (anti-austerity protests in 
Portugal); I, O, U (life and death of former Alaska Senator Ted Stevens); J (anti-doping rules for pentathlon); K (Mississippi 
Blues Trail marker for deceased singer); L (parliamentary vote in Egypt), M (""Senate upset erases Alaska seniority""); N (secret 
CIA prison in Romania); P (snowboarder Kevin Pearce); Q (one-year anniversary of border agent's death); R & X (WikiLeaks 
suspect); S (security guard's ear cut off); T (Congressman cleared in DOJ probe); V (case against VECO CEO); W (late 
Christmas celebrations); Y ($5B deal between Northeast Utilities & NStar); and Z (fact check of Romney's Solyndra claim). The 
 [**6] Appendix gives three examples of the Registered Articles chosen for their differences in length and shows an excerpt 
copied and distributed by Meltwater from these three examples. "
172,2," Meltwater purports to dispute that the excerpts that Meltwater distributed from the Registered Articles can be found verbatim in 
the Registered Articles. While it is undisputed that Meltwater's excerpts do not contain the complete article, a comparison of the 
excerpts with the Registered Article shows that the excerpts were taken word-for-word from the original. There is, therefore, no 
genuine dispute that the excerpts are taken verbatim from the AP articles. See, e.g. Appendix. "
173,3," If a responsive article was published on more than one website, the News Report will often retrieve duplicate results. When a 
result is a duplicate it is clustered with the other identical results. The most recent publication of the article will be the hit that is 
initially visible in the News Report. To the left of the headline of the visible result is a plus sign. Clicking the plus sign permits the 
subscriber to see the duplicate results. "
174,4," Meltwater does not retain ad hoc search results as part of its ordinary business practices. Therefore, there is no evidence in the 
record indicating whether any excerpts from the thirty-three Registered Articles were provided to Meltwater  [**20] subscribers in 
response to ad hoc searches. "
175,5," For twenty-six of the Registered Articles, Meltwater's investigation in response to AP's discovery requests uncovered no clicks. 
For these articles, regardless of the number of times a hyperlink was presented to a customer, the click-through rate is 0%. The 
click-through data for the remaining seven articles is as follows: (1)""AP Exclusive: Inside Romania's secret CIA prison"" was 
provided to Meltwater subscribers 134 times, and the accompanying links were clicked on two occasions, resulting in a 1.5% 
click-through rate; (2) ""When the most wonderful day of the year comes late"": 3,081 links, 1 click, 0.03% click-through rate; (3) 
""Wikileaks suspect seen as hero, traitor"": 1,668 links, 1 click, 0.06% click-through rate; (4)  [**23] ""Northeast Utilities, NStar 
close $5B deal"": 2,917 links, 1 click, 0.03% click-through rate; (5) ""Apple lent weight to dividend comeback in 1Q"": 1,552 links, 1 
click, 0.06%; (6) ""7 accused of $375M Medicare, Medicaid fraud"": 1,313 links, 12 clicks, 0.91% click-through rate; (7) ""Things are 
looking up for state budgets"": 2,361 links, 3 clicks, 0.13% click-through rate."
175,6," AP made repeated requests during the discovery period for additional data on Meltwater's click-through rates. Meltwater 
indicated that it was not surprised by a click-through rate of .05% and refused to provide additional data. It took the position that 
it would be burdensome to obtain more click-through rate data since it does not keep such data in the normal course of its 
business. Its Technical Manager of SaaS Operations opined that it might take twenty-four to thirty-six hours to run the necessary 
queries against its database and that it might also be prudent to copy the data first onto a separate set of servers so that the 
queries would not interfere with the performance of Meltwater's system. "
176,7," Meltwater has also moved for judgment on the pleadings  [**26] with respect to AP's claims of ""hot news"" misappropriation and 
removal or alteration of copyright management information. AP has in turn moved for judgment on the pleadings as to 
Meltwater's counterclaims for libel, tortious interference, and declaratory judgment of safe harbor under the Digital Millennium 
Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 512(c). Those motions are not addressed in this Opinion. "
178,8," Where the copyrighted work constitutes a greater percentage of the secondary work, the latter work is more likely to be non-
transformative. This inquiry is distinct from the analysis in the third factor, part of which considers what portion or percentage of 
the copyrighted work was used in the second work. "
179,9, Meltwater has entered into very few licenses to obtain content. 
180,10," Relying on the publicly available filings in this case, the CCIA pointedly does not take a position on the ultimate question of 
whether Meltwater's copying of expressive content created by AP is a fair use. It simply asks the Court to take into account the 
effect that any ruling may have on the operation of ""legitimate"" online services. That the Court has done."
180,11," While Meltwater asserts that its U.S. subscribers clicked-through to the underlying story millions of times during just the first 
six months of 2012, it has not placed that figure in context  [**42] by disclosing the rate of click-throughs that this number 
represents. Moreover, it rebuffed AP's repeated requests for data on click-through rates and as a result cannot fairly rely on this 
raw number."
180,12," In litigation in Great Britain, the click-through rate was calculated during litigation over licensing fees to be paid for services 
rendered by media monitoring companies. During the litigation, a Meltwater affiliate agreed to pay a web database license and 
lost its argument that it was unnecessary to have a license as well for end users of its service."
180,13," Amici Curiae New York Times, et al., has referred to an article summarizing a 2010 report that found the click-though rate for 
Google News was 56%, a rate that the author of the article believed was probably an understatement. See 
http://techcrunch.com/2010/01/19/outsell-google-news/."
180,14," In its Rule 56(d) motion, Meltwater has not suggested that it needs further discovery regarding click-through rates from third 
parties before these cross-motions for summary judgment may be decided. Quite the contrary, in its own summary judgment 
motion, Meltwater takes the position that it is entitled to judgment on its fair use defense based on the record submitted. "
181,15," While not all of this content is expressive or protected by copyright law, Meltwater has not disputed that some portion of it is."
181,16," The sample Google News Alert excerpts provided with this motion are on average roughly 207 characters long (not including 
white spaces). "
184,17," In Nihon, the court found that the average abstract used two-thirds of the protectable material, using the same structure and 
organization of facts. 166 F.3d at 71."
184,18," Meltwater quotes the following two ledes: ""When Emily Russell's two young sons wake up on Christmas morning, they'll find 
that Santa left them a note instead of the videogames they requested;"" and ""To much of  [**59] the nation, Ted Stevens was the 
crotchety senator who famously referred to the Internet as 'a series of tubes' and fought to build the 'Bridge to Nowhere.'"" "
187,19," Meltwater insists that the parties had no contact in 2009, 2010, or 2011, while AP contends there was ""a casual"" exchange 
between the parties in January 2011."
187,20," Meltwater makes this argument with respect to AP licensees alone, but Meltwater's argument would seemingly apply with 
equal force to AP's own websites. Applying Meltwater's reasoning, AP itself would have to adopt a robots.txt protocol to limit the 
access of web crawlers to its own websites or be deemed to have granted them an implied license. "
188,21," While the robots.txt protocol could work precisely the opposite way, that is, to indicate that every web crawler is permitted 
access except for those for whom permission is denied, it is difficult to envision how a website could effectively manage a 
program that requires it to keep an accurate list of all crawlers who are roaming the web and for whom permission is being 
denied. Meltwater has reserved the right, however, to ignore an exclusion list that lists it. "
189,22," Although Meltwater has not moved for summary judgment on its affirmative defense of an implied license, it has argued that 
the evidence presented in connection with these summary judgment motions ""establishes"" its implied license ""as a matter of 
law."" Nonetheless, it makes one request pursuant to Rule 56(d) in the event the Court disagrees  [**75] and believes that AP's 
motion has merit. Meltwater contends that it needs discovery of AP's internal documents that discuss the ""viability"" of robots.txt. 
This argument does not prevent an entry of summary judgment for AP. Meltwater never mentioned the phrase ""robots.txt"" in any 
of its document requests of AP or in any application to the Court for additional discovery. It had a full opportunity to take 
discovery of AP on this issue and every other issue related to this summary judgment motion and may not prevent entry of 
summary judgment for AP through this belated request. In any event, discovery of AP's internal deliberations regarding the 
robots.txt protocol would have no impact on the decision reached above."
189,23," AP has offered examples of the terms of use found on a number of AP's licensees' websites. Meltwater objects that AP has 
not demonstrated that these terms of use were present on the licensees' websites during the time period in which Meltwater 
scraped articles from those websites. It is undisputed, however, that in at least one instance, Meltwater  [**78] had knowledge of 
a website's terms of use prohibiting commercial use of the website's content and nonetheless scraped an AP article from that 
website a month later. "
190,24," Meltwater  [**80] objects to the evidence of AP's complaint against Moreover on the ground that it constitutes inadmissible 
hearsay. The complaint has not been received for the truth of the matters asserted. Instead it has been received as evidence of 
Meltwater's notice that AP was unlikely to consider Meltwater's actions authorized. "
192,25," The other two documents, two letters exchanged between AP and the Department of Justice, are about a proposed voluntary 
registry. A version of that voluntary registry was apparently incorporated into NewsRight and nothing in that correspondence 
suggests misconduct. "
193,26," Meltwater  [**90] contends that the evidence it has gathered raises a triable issue of fact on its copyright misuse defense, but 
argues in its Rule 56(d) motion that if the Court disagrees with Meltwater that Meltwater should be permitted to take further 
discovery about AP's relationship with NewsRight since AP only produced documents ""sufficient"" to show NewsRight's role in 
licensing AP content and did not respond completely to the document requests posed by Meltwater. Meltwater made a limited request of AP for documents concerning NewsRight, and that request related to the licensing of the 
Registered Articles by NewsRight. It is undisputed that the Registered Articles were never licensed by NewsRight. Despite 
Meltwater's narrow document request, AP searched all of its e-discovery custodians for communications with NewsRight 
concerning licensing efforts generally and produced such documents. It also searched for hard-copy documents from those 
same custodians and produced documents sufficient to show NewsRight's role in licensing AP content, among other things. 
Meltwater examined AP deponents at length about NewsRight. In sum, Meltwater has not shown that it is entitled to further 
discovery on this issue  [**91] before summary judgment may be entered for AP."
193,27," There is evidence that AP's investigator copied and stored the full text of AP articles using a trial subscription to Meltwater 
News. There is also evidence that Meltwater customers used excerpts from two of the Registered Articles and distributed them 
in ten newsletters. "
194,28, Meltwater also makes an unfounded objection to Curley's description of NewsRight on hearsay grounds. 
204,1," The similarities are no coincidence. The Court takes judicial notice that in May 2001, plaintiffs brought a state action with claims 
that were substantially similar to those contained in the present complaint, and sought to certify a class of ""all residents of Ohio 
who purchased and consumed Defendants' Marlboro Lights cigarettes but who do not have a claim for personal injury resulting 
from the purchase or consumption of cigarettes."" (Doc. No. 16-2, State Action Complaint at 243.) This prior action was 
consolidated with Marrone v. Philip Morris Companies Inc., Case No. 99CIV0954 (Medina Ct. Common Pleas) ""for the purpose 
of conducting discovery on class certification issues and briefing on the class certification question."" (See Doc. No. 16-3, Order 
at 273.) By the decision in Marrone, the Ohio Supreme Court reversed the court of appeal's decision affirming the trial court's 
certification of the class under the CSPA. While defendants suggest that plaintiffs' CSPA class claim is also barred by the 
doctrine of collateral estoppel, defendants do not raise this argument in connection with the present  [**8] motion for judgment 
on the pleadings. The Court, therefore, does not reach the issue. "
206,2," Plaintiffs do cite cases that they believe employ an analysis that more closely resembles the test announced by Scalia (and 
joined by three other justices) in Shady Grove. (See Doc. No. 20, Opposition Brief at 491-93.) These opinions offer little 
guidance. None of these cases addressed the treatment of Supreme Court's ""fractured decision,"" and none involved the notice 
requirement of  [**15] Ohio Rev. Code § 1345.09(B). Further, several of the decisions discuss the analysis in only the broadest 
of terms. See, e.g., In re Katrina Canal Breaches Litig.., 401 Fed. Appx. 884, 887 (5th Cir. 2010) (observing that, generally, 
federal procedural rules govern over state rules of procedure in actions brought in federal court); Coastal Conserv. Ass'n v. 
Locke, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 34152, 2010 WL 1407680, at *1-*2 (M.D. Fla. 2010) (citing Shady Grove's plurality for its general 
comparison of procedural and substantive rules). Ultimately, the Court agrees with the majority of courts that have concluded 
that Stevens's concurring opinion in Shady Grove controls. See Leonard, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 30608, 2012 WL 764199, at *12 
(collecting cases from the ""majority of district and circuit courts that have found Justice Stevens concurring opinion was on the 
'narrowest grounds'. . . ."")"
206,3," Plaintiffs also note that the New York statute at issue in Shady Grove limited certain statutory damages in class actions, while 
Ohio Rev. Code § 1345.09(B) requires notice before any damages can be sought by a class. (Doc. No. 20, Opposition Brief at 
496.) However, they fail to explain how this distinction has any bearing on defendants' motion. "
207,4," Plaintiffs alternatively urge the Court to look beyond the ruling in Shady Grove, and deny defendants' motion by relying upon 
the Supreme Court's earlier decision in Sibbach v. Wilson & Co., Inc., 312 U.S. 1, 61 S. Ct. 422, 85 L. Ed. 479 (1941), which 
they contend is ""still good law . . . ."" (Doc. No. 20, Opposition Brief at 496, bolding in original.) The Court agrees that Sibbach is 
still good law, but finds that it does not compel a contrary result. As Stevens explained in Shady Grove, Sibbach did not address 
""the specific question of 'the obligation of federal courts to apply substantive law of a state.'"" Shady Grove, 130 S. Ct. at 1454 
(quoting Sibbach, 61 S. Ct. at 422) (Stevens, J., concurring). The inquiry in Sibbach was limited to determining whether the 
application of federal rules requiring medical exams for litigants pertained to ""'substantive rights' under the Enabling Act."" Shady 
Grove, 130 S. Ct. at 1454-55 (Stevens, J., concurring). It did not, as Stevens noted, involve the application of state law. Id. at 
1454. So while  [**19] Sibbach still stands for the proposition that the application of federal rules that are merely procedural does 
not offend the Rules Enabling Act, it does not offer any guidance as to whether plaintiffs' CSPA class claim may proceed."
207,5," Because the highest court in Ohio has not addressed this state law issue, ""this Court must attempt to predict what the 
 [**21] Ohio Supreme Court would do if presented with this question."" McKinney, 744 F. Supp. 2d at 750 (citing Mazur v. Young, 
507 F.3d 1013, 1016-17 (6th Cir. 2007)). In McKinney, Judge O'Malley certified to the Ohio Supreme Court the question of a 
consumer's standing under the DTPA. Id. at 752. However, the issue was never addressed by the Ohio Supreme Court because 
the plaintiff dismissed the DTPA claim. See Robins, 838 F. Supp. 2d at 650 n.3."
207,6," Plaintiffs suggest that while federal courts continue to find no room for consumer actions under the DTPA, Ohio courts—both 
before and after the Eighth Appellate District's decision in Dawson—have provided for such causes of action. (Doc. No. 24, 
Opposition Brief at 538-9.) However, none of the cases cited by plaintiffs addressed the issue of standing. As such, they offer no 
guidance. See, e.g., Thornton v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., Inc., No. 1:06-cv-00018, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 83968, 2006 WL 
3359448, at *17 (N.D. Ohio Nov. 17, 2006) (rejecting reliance on similar decisions not addressing consumer standing when 
dismissing DTPA claim); see generally State ex rel. United Auto. Aerospace & Argic. Implement Workers of Am. v. Bur. of 
Workers' Comp., 108 Ohio St. 3d 432, 440, 2006 Ohio 1327, 844 N.E.2d 335, 343 (Ohio 2006)  [**22] (finding no precedential 
value to decisions that did not reach the issue that was before the court). "
209,7," The Lanham Act and the DTPA contain many similarities. For example, the Lanham Act proscribes false statements likely ""to 
deceive as to the affiliation, connection, or association of such person with another person, or as to the origin, sponsorship, or 
approval of his or her goods, services  [**28] or commercial activities by another person[.]"" 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a)(1)(A). The DTPA 
similarly proscribes representations ""that goods or services have sponsorship, approval, characteristics, ingredients, uses, 
benefits, or quantities that they do not have, or that a person has a sponsorship, approval, status, affiliation, or connection that 
the person does not have[.]"" Ohio Rev. Code § 4165.02(A)(7)."
209,8," Plaintiffs argue that the DTPA and the CSPA do not cover the same conduct. According to Plaintiffs, the DTPA covers conduct 
leading up to the transaction whereas the CSPA covers conduct that occurs ""before, during, or after the consumer transaction."" 
(Doc. No. 24, Opposition Brief at 539.) If anything, this argument cuts against plaintiffs' interpretation of these statutes. While the 
DTPA was promulgated to address anti-competitive activity in commercial transactions, the language of the CSPA makes clear 
that it was passed to provide relief for consumers who are affected by these practices. See Ohio Rev. Code § 1345.09(A) 
(""Where the violation was an act prohibited by section 1345.02, 1345.03, 1345.031 of the Revised Code, the consumer may, in 
an individual action, rescind the transactions or recover the consumer's actual economic damages plus an amount not 
exceeding  [**30] five thousand dollars in noneconomic damages."" ) (emphasis added). "
222,1," The parties' briefing includes over 600 numbered paragraphs of ""undisputed"" facts, many of which are, in fact, hotly disputed. 
In this Order, the Court sets forth only the facts that are pertinent to its analysis of the issues."
222,2," Because there  [**4] are cross-motions for summary judgment and nearly four hundred exhibits attached thereto, for ease of 
reference, the Court will cite to the parties' briefs for record support. "
223,3," It appears Plaintiff began selling the devices before the Agreement was fully executed. However, the record shows that the 
material provisions of the Agreement had been negotiated and agreed upon before July 2009. (ECF No. 128 ¶ 79.) "
225,4," Though Plaintiff brings a tying claim under both the per se analysis and the rule of reason analysis, the test for these claims 
appears to be the same. United States v. Microsoft Corp., 87 F.Supp.2d 30, 47 (D.D.C. 2000) (noting that the four elements of 
an unlawful tying claim are the same regardless of whether the arrangement is subjected to the per se or the rule of reason 
analysis). Neither party has drawn a distinction between the two in its papers and, applying the law to the facts of this case, the 
Court has been unable to discern any meaningful distinction here between the per se and the rule of reason analysis."
225,5," There is evidence that commercial customers are required to purchase the app for $9.99 through Apple's volume purchase 
program. (Buhl Dep. at 234.) However, this amount was imposed by Apple and has since been rescinded. (ECF No. 180-95.) 
Thus, the Court finds no evidence showing that Defendant has charged or is currently charging a fee for its app. "
227,6," The viability of the pretext argument in the Tenth Circuit is in significant dispute. The case relied on by the Plaintiff in support of 
this contention was rejected by the Federal Circuit in Xerox and has otherwise been criticized. See Xerox, 203 F.3d at 1328; 
Schor v. Abbott Labs., 457 F.3d 608, 613-14 (7th Cir. 2006).  [**23] On the other hand, the Federal Circuit (predicting how the 
Tenth Circuit would rule) has held that a copyright holder's presumption of a valid business judgment can be overcome only by a 
showing that the copyright was obtained in violation of the law or that the copyright holder exceeded the scope of the copyright. 
Xerox, 203 F.3d at 1329. "
235,7," In a sixty-page Motion for Summary Judgment, Defendant devotes four pages to discussion of these four claims. (ECF No. 
128.) "
239,1," This action was removed to this Court from New York State Supreme Court, Albany County. Thereafter, Defendants filed their 
first motion to dismiss the complaint. (See Dkt. No. 15.) Before filing their memorandum of law in opposition to Defendants' 
motion to dismiss, Plaintiff amended its complaint. Thereafter, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. 
(See Dkt. No. 23.) The parties agree that Defendants' first motion to dismiss is moot because Plaintiff's amended complaint 
supersedes its original complaint ""in its entirety for all purposes."" (Dkt. No. 23-1, at 2 (citing Coleman v. City of Syracuse, No. 
5:09-CV-1391, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 456, 2011 WL 13808, at *1 (N.D.N.Y. Jan. 4, 2011) [Defs.' Joint Mem. of Law, at 2 n.1].) 
(See also Dkt. No. 25, at 1 [Pl.'s Mem. of Law].) Accordingly, Defendants' first motion to dismiss is denied as moot. "
240,2," Plaintiff has identified a list, which is not exhaustive, of nine of its customers that have ""left [P]laintiff due to"" Defendants' 
conduct. (Dkt. No. 19, at ¶ 19 [Am. Compl.].) "
251,1," The Davis-Bacon Act requires contractors working on projects financed in whole or in part with federal funds to pay workers no 
less than the wage paid to ""the corresponding classes of laborers and mechanics employed on the projects of a character similar 
to the contract work in the . . . State in which the work is to be performed."" 40 U.S.C. § 3142(b). The Act also bars the ""kickback"" 
of any portion of a worker's Davis-Bacon wages, ""regardless of any contractual relationship."" 40 U.S.C. § 3142(c)(1)."
251,2," Some 70 percent of the steel erection work in the Boston-area market has historically been performed by unionized 
contractors. "
252,3," The exemption of labor unions from the antitrust laws reflects both a congressional and a judicial recognition of the need to 
ensure that organized labor is able to operate as an effective monopoly without fear of becoming enmeshed in the antitrust laws. 
Id. at 475."
252,4," On these four projects, the jurors found that the fabricators had agreed under pressure from Local 7 to replace D.F.M. and Ajax 
with union erectors."
252,5," In post-trial proceedings, the court denied Local 7's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and motion for a new 
 [**8] trial. See Dkt #s 172 & 179. "
253,6," The First Circuit characterized plaintiffs' Davis-Bacon Act argument as ""acrobatic . . . shoehorn[ing]."" Id. at 81. It nonetheless 
offered as an aside that the ""MRP may very well violate  [**12] the Davis-Bacon Act,"" id, although it agreed with this court that 
plaintiffs did not have the standing necessary to prosecute a Davis-Bacon claim. In the end, the First Circuit opinion left open the 
question of whether a kickback violation under the Davis-Bacon Act might render otherwise legitimate union activity ineligible for 
antitrust protection. Id. at 81 n.13. "
254,7," Section 7 of the NLRA ""protects concerted employee activities engaged in 'for the purpose of collective bargaining or other 
mutual aid or protection.' It is settled that these protections encompass employee attempts to improve terms and conditions of 
employment with their employer as well as attempts to otherwise improve their lot . . . through channels outside the immediate 
employee-employer relationship."" 359 NLRB No. 2, [WL] at *6 (internal quotation marks omitted)."
254,8, Plaintiffs point out that two of the NLRB members who participated in the 3-1 Croson decision were recess appointees.
254,9," The Obama Administration has announced its intention to seek a grant of certiorari. As the Court in Canning noted, the circuits 
are divided over the proper interpretation of the Recess Appointments Clause. See Canning, 705 F.3d at 511. "
255,10," Local 7 doubts whether  [**19] the exclusionary element can be said to be met at all as neither Local 7 nor the fabricators are 
in direct competition with the nonunion erectors. "
256,11," There may be something to Local 7's argument that because its members tend to  [**24] be more experienced, they work 
more efficiently than the typical non-union worker, hence offsetting some of the impact of the wage differential."
256,12," Plaintiffs argue that the higher costs of the section 8(e) agreements are evidence that Local 7 had the power to impose higher 
prices on the market. However, the evidence at trial showed that the section 8(e) agreements were achieved through coercive "
257,," tactics and threats of violence. The fact that Local 7 in these instances was forced to resort to illegality is more indicative of 
market weakness than an ability to dictate price by means of market dominance. "
258,13," Plaintiffs respond with the argument that Local 7 cannot point to any record evidence that the signatories' lower bids on 
targeted jobs were not predatory. This contention, however, stands the burden of proof on its head. Plaintiffs bear the ultimate 
burden of proving their claims, and on summary judgment must identify some evidence on which a jury could reasonably find in 
their favor on this point. See Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252. That they have not done."
258,14," Local 7 also argues that there can be no predatory pricing where there is no ""dangerous probability [] of recouping [the] 
investment in below-cost prices."" Id. at 224. Such a probability does not exist in the structural steel industry because the 
competition is fierce, and the barrier to entry is very low."
258,15," Plaintiffs also argue that a subsidy cannot be factored into the calculus of whether a price is above or below cost. However, in 
the cases they cite  [**29] — D & S Redi-Mix v. Sierra Redi-Mix & Contracting Co., 692 F.2d 1245 (9th Cir. 1982), and Jiffy Lube 
Int'l, Inc. v. Lake, 1982 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17244, 1982 WL 1930 (D. Wyo. Oct. 1, 1982) — the subsidy was externally funded, and 
did not reduce the actual cost of the services provided. Here, however, MRP funds are collected from union erection workers 
who, in essence, agree to work at a lower wage. Thus seen, the MRP monies reflect an actual savings in the signatory's labor 
costs, a savings that accrues ultimately to the customer."
258,16," Plaintiffs' more general ""monopolization"" claim fails because, as earlier explained, there is no evidence that Local 7, through 
the use of the MRP, has ""the power to control prices or exclude competition"" in the structural steel market. See United States v. 
Grinnell Corp., 384 U.S. 563, 571, 86 S. Ct. 1698, 16 L. Ed. 2d 778 (1966). "
264,1," A “Designated Market Area” is a term used by Nielsen Media Research to define a broadcast-television market. Strictly 
speaking, the Philadelphia DMA comprises 18 counties, not 16."
264,2," Respondents sought certification for the following class: “All cable television customers who subscribe or subscribed at any 
times since December 1, 1999, to the present to video programming services (other than solely to basic cable services) from 
Comcast, or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates in Comcast's Philadelphia cluster.” App. 35a."
264,3," The District Court did not hold that the three alternative theories of liability failed to establish antitrust impact, but merely that 
those theories could not be determined in a manner common to all the class plaintiffs. The other theories of liability may well be 
available for the plaintiffs to pursue as individual actions. Any contention that the plaintiffs should be allowed to recover 
 [****9] damages attributable to all four theories in this class action would erroneously suggest one of two things--either that the 
plaintiffs may also recover such damages in individual actions or that they are precluded from asserting those theories in 
individual actions. "
265,4," The question presented reads: “Whether a district court may certify a class action without resolving whether the plaintiff class 
had introduced admissible evidence,  [****11] including expert testimony, to show that the case is susceptible to awarding 
damages on a class-wide basis.” 567 U.S., at 933, 133 S. Ct. 24, 183 L. Ed. 2d, at 674. Respondents contend that petitioners 
forfeited their ability to answer this question in the negative because they did not make an objection to the admission of Dr. 
McClave's testimony under the Federal Rules of Evidence. See Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 
113 S. Ct. 2786, 125 L. Ed. 2d 469 (1993). Such a forfeit would make it impossible for petitioners to argue that Dr. McClave's 
testimony was not “admissible evidence” under the Rules; but it does not make it impossible for them to argue that the evidence 
failed “to show that the case is susceptible to awarding damages on a class-wide basis.” Petitioners argued below, and continue 
to argue here, that certification was improper because respondents had failed to establish that damages could be measured on 
a classwide basis. That is the question we address here. "
267,5," The dissent is of the view that what an econometric model proves is a “question of fact” on which we will not “undertake to 
review concurrent findings . . . by two courts below in the absence of a very obvious and exceptional showing of error.” Post, at 
___, 185 L. Ed. 2d, at 529 (quoting United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 589, n. 5, 116 S. Ct. 2264, 135 L. Ed. 2d 735 (1996) 
(Scalia, J., dissenting); internal quotation marks omitted). To begin with, neither of the courts below found that the model 
established damages attributable  [****18] to overbuilding alone. Second, while the data contained within an econometric model 
may well be “questions of fact” in the relevant sense, what those data prove is no more a question of fact than what our opinions 
hold. And finally, even if it were a question of fact, concluding that the model here established damages attributable to 
overbuilding alone would be “obvious[ly] and exceptional[ly]” erroneous."
267,6," We might add that even if the model had identified subscribers who paid more solely because of the deterrence of overbuilding, 
it still would not have established the requisite commonality of damages unless it plausibly showed that the extent of 
overbuilding (absent deterrence) would have been the same in all counties, or that the extent is irrelevant  [****21] to effect upon 
ability to charge supra competitive prices. "
269,*," A class may be divided into subclasses for adjudication of damages. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23(c)(4)-(5). Or, at the outset, a class 
may be certified for liability purposes only, leaving individual damages calculations to subsequent proceedings. See 2 W. 
Rubenstein, Newberg on Class Actions § 4:54, pp. 206-208 (5th ed. 2012). Further, a certification order may be altered or 
amended as the case unfolds. Rule 23(c)(1)(C). "
279,1," The  [*2] docket lists the plaintiff as ""BNLfood Investment SARL."" The amended complaint and subsequent documents have

279,7," Under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and implementing regulations, ""infant formula"" is a food for persons not more than 12 
months old simulating or substituting for human milk. See 21 U.S.C. § 321(z); 21 C.F.R. § 105.3(e)."
279,8," Like the parties, the Court will generally use ""BNLfood"" generically to refer to the various related entities unless there is a 
specific reason to do otherwise. See generally ECF Nos. 78, 82. The holding company will be referred to as ""BNLfood SARL."" "
280,9, The date is not in the record.
280,10, The increases varied among the customers. See Pl. Ex. 17. 
281,11," GRAS is an acronym for ""Generally Recognized as Safe."" Recognition as GRAS, or approval as a food additive, is required 
before an ingredient may be added to infant formula. See Def. Ex. 15 at 19:10-22. There are two ways in which a product can be 
GRAS. First, the manufacturers can submit data to the Food and Drug Administration (""FDA"") for review. Id. at 20:7-12. Second, 
the manufacturer can undertake the same tests but submit the data to the FDA only if challenged. Id. at 20:16-21:1. Generally, 
the GRAS process involves an expert panel determining the safety of the ingredient. Id. at 39:9-12. "

P. 56 advisory committee's note. "
283,13," Martek generally asserts these arguments under the broader test of § 3 of the Clayton Act which requires a contract for the 
violation; § 2 of the Sherman Act requires willful maintenance of a monopoly, but no contract. See ECF No. 78-1-1 at 31 n.26; 
see also 15 U.S.C. §§ 2, 14; United States v. Grinnell Corp., 384 U.S. 563, 570-71, 86 S. Ct. 1698, 16 L. Ed. 2d 778 (1966); 
 [*17] Cavalier Telephone, LLC v. Verizon Va., Inc., 330 F.3d 176, 183 (4th Cir. 2003). Additionally, interpretation of Maryland antitrust law is ""guided"" by the interpretation of the analogous federal statute. See Md. 
Code Ann., Com. Law § 11-202(a)(2); Natural Design, Inc. v. Rouse Co., 302 Md. 47, 485 A.2d 663, 666 (Md. 1984). 
Accordingly, only one analysis is necessary."
283,14," Although Martek ""does not agree with the geographic market pled in the Amended Complaint,"" it has not presented any 
argument against it. See ECF No. 78-1-1 at 31 n.28. "
284,15," In its reply memorandum, Martek raises a new argument that DHA and ARA are not actually interchangeable to be part of the 
same market. See ECF No. 84 at 21-22. Although DHA and ARA can be sold separately, as Martek does, there is evidence that 
the two compounds work together to have beneficial developmental effects. See Pl. Ex. 166 (scientific study); Def. Ex. 4 (FDA 
noting that [t]he ratio of ARA to DHA, although not entirely understood is considered to be nutritionally important.""). Because of 
this uncertainty as to the exact interaction between and interdependence of DHA and ARA, a reasonable  [*20] jury could 
conclude that they are part of the same market. See Def. Ex. 2 at 133:7-10 (""What's relevant is the market for the bundle that 
includes both."")."
284,16," Although Martek frames the inquiry in terms of ""market power,"" the cases it cites concern monopoly power. See ECF No. 78-1-
1 at 32. Section 2 of the Sherman Act prohibits, inter alia, actual monopolies, which BNLfood alleges that Martek has. See ECF 
No. 12 ¶ 53. In contrast, § 3 of the Clayton Act prohibits the ""probable effect"" of the foreclosure of competition. See Microsoft, 
253 F.3d 34, 69, 346 U.S. App. D.C. 330 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (citing Tampa Electric, 365 U.S. at 327). Some courts have applied the 
same test of market foreclosure to claims under § 1 of the Sherman Act and § 3 of the Clayton Act. See, e.g. Roland Mach. Co. 
v. Dresser Indus., Inc. 749 F.2d 380, 393 (7th Cir. 1984) (Posner, J.). But see e.g., Barr Labs., Inc. v. Abbott Labs., 978 F.2d 98, 
110 (3d Cir. 1992) (holding that § 3 of the Clayton Act imposes a ""more rigorous  [*21] standard[]""). ""Monopoly power under § 2 
requires, of course, something greater than market power under § 1."" Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Technical Servs., Inc., 504 
U.S. 451, 480, 112 S. Ct. 2072, 119 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1992). But cf. Microsoft, 253 F.3d at 70 (positing that in certain 
circumstances, a monopolist's contracts could violate § 2 but not § 1). Even if § 3 of the Clayton Act and § 1 of the Sherman Act 
are not analyzed under the same standard, § 3's probable effect test means that the showing of power requires a lesser showing 
than a current monopoly under § 2. See Tampa Electric., 365 U.S. at 328 (""[T]he competition foreclosed by the contract must be 
found to constitute a substantial share of the relevant market.""). Despite Martek's framing of its market power as monopoly 
power, it expressly states that it was engaging in a Clayton Act analysis, rather than the stricter Sherman Act analysis. ECF No. 
78-1 at 31 n.27. Because there is sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find that Martek has a monopoly, the Court need 
not analyze the differing standards."
284,17," United States v. Microsoft Corp., 253 F.3d at 54 (quoting United States v. Grinnell Corp., 384 U.S. 563, 571, 86 S. Ct. 1698, 
16 L. Ed. 2d 778 (1966); Hunt-Wesson Foods, Inc. v. Ragu Foods, Inc., 627 F.2d 919, 924 (9th Cir. 1980); citing Ball Mem'l 
Hosp., Inc. v. Mut. Hosp. Ins., Inc., 784 F.2d 1325, 1336 (7th Cir. 1986)). "
285,18," Martek asserts that even a 100% market share does not mean a monopoly, citing Los Angeles Land Co. v. Brunswick Corp., 6 
F.3d 1422 (9th Cir. 1993).  [*23] ECF No. 84 at 22. In that case, however, two competitors withdrew from the market—one after 
a fire—and there was no evidence of control of the market. See id at 1425-26, 1429."
285,19," Martek's reading of Western Parcel Express is far too restrictive. Martek asserts that Western Parcel Express stated that entry 
barriers are only ""additional long-run costs that were not incurred by incumbent firms but must be incurred by new entrants"" and 
Martek was not free of any regulatory hurdles that BNLfood must overcome. ECF No. 84 at 24 (quoting W. Parcel Express, 190 
F.3d at 975). However, Western Parcel Express made clear that the long-run costs were only one form of entry barrier; another 
is ""factors in the market that deter entry while permitting incumbent firms to earn market returns."" W. Parcel Express, 190 F.3d at 
975. The court then listed the above factors. Id. "

negotiations with the formula manufacturers. Def. Ex 73 at 61:16-25. "

287,25," Martek does not appear to dispute other indicia of BNLfood's preparedness to enter the market. See ECF No. 78-1-1 at 46 & 
n.36. For example, BNLfood has constructed  [*33] a new plant, and executed nondisclosure agreements with potential clients.

289,30," Martek attempts to undermine Hawes's credibility on this point by pointing out that Hawes later retreated from some of his 
positions, and the Nestle employee as new to the United States. ECF No. 84. This argument is irrelevant to the summary 
judgment analysis, as the Court must determine whether Martek is entitled to judgment as a matter of law ""without weighing the 
evidence or assessing the witnesses' credibility."" Dennis, 290 F.3d at 645."

BNLfood has not explained, however, how this is relevant to Martek's actions in the U.S. market."
290,38," Martek also asserts that BNLfood SARL lacks prudential standing because any harm was to its subsidiaries, and not BNLfood 
SARL directly. See ECF Nos. 78 at 49, 84 at 20 n.20. Because the BNLfood does not have antitrust standing, the Court does not 
reach the  [*42] less stringent prudential standing inquiry. "
299,1," The facts are drawn from the Complaint (""Compl."") and the documents and exhibits attached thereto. In deciding the instant

299,2," In its opposition papers, MiniFrame cites only New York law to support its common law unfair competition and tortious

2:09-cv-02884-GEB-GGH, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 57732, at *6-9 (E.D. Cal. June 10, 2010);  [*2] Gens v. Wachovia Mortg.

324,2," The court must point out that the case relied upon by Defendant for this argument, Rosal v. First Federal Bank of California, 
671 F. Supp. 2d 1111 (N.D. Cal. 2009), is distinguishable since the district court relied, at least in part, on Plaintiff's failure to 
differentiate fraud allegations between many defendants. That type of pleading raises rather obvious notice concerns not at 
issue in this case with only one defendant. "
325,3," In that regard, the court finds unpersuasive district court opinions restricting FAL claims to this definition. See Spurlock v. 
Carrington Mortg. Servs., No. 09CV2273-MMA (JMA), 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 80221, at *18, 2010 WL 3069733 (S.D. Cal. Aug. 
4, 2010)."
325,4," In Chern, the court found held that Defendant's ""practice of quoting as a 'per annum' rate interest computed on the basis of a 
360-day year is likely to mislead and deceive a bank's potential borrowers, and that if, as alleged, defendant has adopted such 
practice it constitutes false and misleading advertising under Business and Professions Code section 17500."" 15 Cal. 3d at 876. 
Contrary to what Defendant may argue, the  [*14] instant allegations are analogous because Plaintiff contends that Defendant 
engaged in a ""common business practice"" directed at its borrowers."
325,5," The court rejects Defendant's argument that its allegedly misleading statements are non-actionable, either because they are 
statements of law or true statements. Nothing about these statements suggests they are merely recitations of the law as 
opposed to factual statements concerning when Defendant might consider a borrower for a loan modification. See Fletcher v. 
OneWest Bank, FSB, 798 F. Supp. 2d 925, 934 (N.D. Ill. 2011). In addition, true statements can still be misleading. Kasky v. 
Nike, Inc., 27 Cal. 4th 939, 951, 119 Cal. Rptr. 2d 296, 45 P.3d 243 (2002). On a motion to dismiss, the court cannot construe 
the allegations in Defendant's favor in the way it requests. See Love, 915 F.2d at 1245. "
327,6," As this court observed in another case: The definition of an unfair business practice in consumer cases has been unsettled since the California Supreme Court 
ruling in Cel-Tech, which provided a definition in the context of an antitrust case, but did not address unfairness in the 
consumer context. . . . In 2006, the appellate court in Camacho v. Automobile Club of Southern California, 142 Cal. App. 
4th 1394, 48 Cal. Rptr. 3d 770 (2006), used the Federal Trade Commission Act as guidance for the definition of unfairness. 
""(1) The consumer injury must be substantial; (2) the injury must not be outweighed by any countervailing benefits to 
consumers or competition; and (3) it must be an injury that consumers themselves could not reasonably have avoided."" 
 [*21] Id. at 1403. Several appellate courts and district courts have accepted Camacho's test. In re Apple In-App Purchase Litig., 855 F. Supp. 2d 1030, 1040 n.8 (N.D. Cal. 2012). "
350,1," Because each amended complaint asserts only one federal antitrust claim, we will refer in the singular to plaintiffs' federal 
antitrust ""claim."" Similarly, because each of the Schwab amended complaints asserts one RICO claim and one Cartwright Act 
claim, we will refer in the singular to the Schwab plaintiffs' RICO ""claim"" and Cartwright Act ""claim."" "
351,2," The six amended complaints subject to defendants' motions to dismiss are essentially identical in their allegations regarding the 
background of this case and the misconduct that defendants allegedly committed. Therefore, in section A, providing background 
on LIBOR, and section B, discussing defendants' alleged misconduct, we will cite exclusively to the OTC Amended Complaint, 
with the understanding that parallel allegations are contained in most or all of the other amended complaints. By contrast, the 
primary areas in which the amended complaints differ are in their allegations of who the plaintiffs are, how they were allegedly 
injured,  [**29] and what claims they are asserting against defendants. Accordingly, in Part C, when we discuss plaintiffs' alleged 
injury, we will explore the allegations particular to specific amended complaints. "
353,3," These articles will be discussed in detail below in the context of whether plaintiffs' commodities manipulation claims are time-
barred. "
356,4," The ""Schwab Bank"" action is Charles Schwab Bank, N.A. v. Bank of America Corp. (11 Civ. 6411)."

356,6," The ""Schwab Money"" action is Schwab Money Market Fund v. Bank of America Corp. (11 Civ. 6412). "
358,7," Here, plaintiffs have alleged that defendants violated the Sherman Act through a horizontal price-fixing conspiracy. The 
element of defendants' alleged price fixing which makes it unlawful, as with any conduct in violation of the antitrust laws, is its 
effect of restraining competition. See Arizona v. Maricopa Cnty. Med. Soc'y, 457 U.S. 332, 345, 102 S. Ct. 2466, 73 L. Ed. 2d 48 
(1982) (""The aim and result of every price-fixing agreement, if effective, is the elimination of one form of competition. The power 
to fix prices, whether reasonably exercised or not, involves power to  [**54] control the market and to fix arbitrary and 
unreasonable prices. . . . Agreements which create such potential power may well be held to be in themselves unreasonable or 
unlawful restraints, without the necessity of minute inquiry whether a particular price is reasonable or unreasonable as fixed . . . 
."" (quoting United States v. Trenton Potteries Co., 273 U.S. 392, 397-98, 47 S. Ct. 377, 71 L. Ed. 700 (1927))). "
359,8," References preceded by ""Tr."" refer to the transcript of the oral argument held on March 5, 2013. "
360,9," Contra to plaintiffs' argument, the Ninth Circuit's decision in Knevelbaard Dairies v. Kraft Foods, Inc., 232 F.3d 979 (9th Cir. 
2000), is not to the contrary. Knevelbaard Dairies involved a claim by plaintiff milk producers that defendant cheese makers had 
conspired to fix a low price for bulk  [**60] cheese, thereby depressing the price defendants paid plaintiffs for milk because 
California regulators used the bulk cheese price to set the minimum milk price. Plaintiffs had argued that defendants ""did not 
compete,"" but rather ""collusively manipulate[ed] [bulk cheese] prices to levels lower than would prevail under conditions of free 
and open competition."" Id. at 984. The Ninth Circuit held that plaintiffs had adequately alleged antitrust injury. As quoted by 
plaintiffs, the Court reasoned: Since the plaintiffs allegedly were subjected to artificially depressed milk prices, the injury flows ""from that which makes the 
conduct unlawful,"" i.e., from the collusive price manipulation itself. . . . When horizontal price fixing causes buyers to pay 
more, or sellers to receive less, than the prices that would prevail in a market free of the unlawful trade restraint, antitrust 
injury occurs. Antitrust Opp'n 37 (quoting Knevelbaard Dairies, 232 F.3d at 987-88). However, in the context of the claims before it, the Ninth 
Circuit clearly intended to refer to collusive price manipulation in place of competition, and its reference to paying more or 
receiving less than the prices that would prevail  [**61] in a market free of the unlawful trade restraint clearly contrasted prices in 
a market with such a restraint to a market operating under free competition. Moreover, the Ninth Circuit explicitly recognized that 
""the central purpose of the antitrust laws, state and federal, is to preserve competition, "" Knevelbaard Dairies, 232 F.3d at 988, 
and it quoted a leading antitrust treatise for the proposition that the harm to sellers from a price-fixing conspiracy by buyers 
""constitutes antitrust injury, for it reflects the rationale for condemning buying cartels - namely, suppression of competition 
among buyers, reduced upstream and downstream output, and distortion of prices,"" id. (quoting 2 Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert 
Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law ¶ 375b at 297 (rev. ed. 1995)) (emphasis added). "
362,10," Indeed, given that a bank's LIBOR quote represents the bank's expectation of its own costs of borrowing, and that different 
 [**68] banks based in different countries could sensibly face significantly different borrowing costs, it would not be surprising for 
banks to submit LIBOR quotes that differed persistently over the course of several years. "
364,11," As discussed below, we assert supplemental jurisdiction over plaintiffs' Cartwright Act claim. "
369,12," Plaintiffs argue in their  [**94] opposition brief that the Barclays settlement documents suggest LIBOR manipulation extending 
as far back as 2005, and that they should, accordingly, be granted leave to amend their complaint to include allegations based 
on information derived from the Barclays settlements. Exchange Opp'n 29-30. As discussed below, we will grant plaintiffs leave 
to move to amend their complaints to include such allegations."
369,13, One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. 
374,14," That said, the May 29, 2008, Wall Street Journal article presenting the Journal's analysis of LIBOR did single out the 
submissions of individual panel banks. In its second paragraph, it reported: ""The Journal analysis indicates that Citigroup Inc., 
WestLB, HBOS PLC, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and UBS AG are among the banks that have been reporting significantly lower 
borrowing costs for [LIBOR] than what another market measure suggests they should be."" Mollenkamp & Whitehouse, supra. 
Additionally, it included a chart that presented, for each USD LIBOR panel bank, ""[t]he difference between banks' reported 
borrowing rates [i.e. LIBOR quotes] and rates computed by The Wall Street Journal, using information from the default-insurance 
market."" Id."
374,15," Although, on any given day, only the middle eight quotes would be included in the computation to determine the LIBOR fix, all 
of the submitted quotes ""affected"" the ultimate fix. For example, if a bank's ""true"" LIBOR quote would have been the tenth 
highest, within the middle eight, but the bank submitted instead an artificially low quote that was the fourteenth highest, outside 
the middle eight, the bank's quote would not be included in the computation to determine the LIBOR fix. Nonetheless, the quote 
would have affected the fix by ""bumping up"" the quote that would have been in the thirteenth highest spot, excluded from the 
calculation, into the twelfth highest spot, included in the calculation. Thus, on any given day, every LIBOR quote had some 
""effect"" on the ultimate LIBOR fix. "
378,16," On March 27, 2013, we received from plaintiffs two documents issued by the UK Financial Services Authority (the ""FSA""): (1) 
the ""FSA Internal Audit Report: A Review of the Extent of Awareness Within the FSA of Inappropriate LIBOR Submissions,"" 
dated March 2013, and (2) the ""Management Response"" to that report, also dated March 2013. These documents do not alter 
our conclusions. "
383,17," Indeed, it may be that no one knows what LIBOR's ""true"" level was for any day during the Class Period. As discussed above, 
LIBOR is inherently a theoretical value, derived as it is from quotes that are not based directly on any objective data. Moreover, 
the challenge of determining LIBOR's ""true"" level would be compounded with respect to periods of time, such as the Class 
Period, during which the volume of actual interbank trading was at a significantly reduced level. "
384,18," The implication of this conclusion is that, although plaintiffs will proceed on their commodities manipulation claims, they are 
precluded from pursuing those claims with regard to defendants' alleged manipulation of LIBOR qua commodity. In order to 
recover, therefore, they will need to show that defendants specifically intended to manipulate the price of Eurodollar futures 
contracts, not merely LIBOR itself. As a practical matter, we anticipate that this limitation might have significant repercussions for 
the relief that plaintiffs are ultimately able to recover."
384,19," For this reason, we need not take a position on what degree of deference we owe, if any, to the CFTC statements cited by 
plaintiffs. See, e.g., CFTC Order, at 27 (""Barclays' traders and submitters each specifically intended to affect the price at which 
the daily BBA LIBOR for U.S. Dollar, Sterling, and Yen (for particular tenors), and the EBF Euribor (for particular tenors), all 
commodities in interstate commerce, would be fixed.""). "
392,20," It is of no avail to plaintiffs that they allege that they ""do not base their RICO claim[] on any conduct that would have been 
actionable as fraud in the purchase or sale of securities."" Schwab Bank Am. Compl. ¶ 227. First, this is a legal conclusion that 
we need not accept as true. Second, regardless of whether plaintiffs are correct that they could not have brought a private action 
for securities fraud based on the alleged RICO predicate acts, those predicate acts could, as discussed above, have been the 
basis for a securities fraud action brought by the SEC. This is sufficient for plaintiffs' RICO claim to be barred under the PSLRA's 
RICO Amendment. "
393,21," It is irrelevant whether the statutes prohibiting the alleged predicate acts apply extraterritorially. See Norex, 631 F.3d at 33 
(""Morrison similarly forecloses [plaintiff]'s  [**187] argument that because a number of RICO's predicate acts possess an 
extraterritorial reach, RICO itself possesses an extraterritorial reach.""). "
395,22," Even if we considered the second stage of the alleged fraud - each defendant's sale of LIBOR-based financial instruments to 
its customers - we would not necessarily locate the enterprise in the United States. Contrary to plaintiffs' argument, Tr. 97, the 
fact that only U.S. customers have brought suit pursuant to RICO does not indicate that defendants in fact targeted their sale of 
LIBOR-based instruments at the U.S. Because LIBOR is a reference point around the world, id., it seems likely that defendants, 
which are headquartered around the world, would have sold LIBOR-based financial instruments  [**195] to plaintiffs around the 
world. Consequently, even if we focused on where defendants sold LIBOR-based instruments, our analysis would not 
necessarily point to the United States. Furthermore, given that the first stage of the alleged fraud clearly centered on England, 
the indeterminate location of the second stage reinforces our conclusion that the alleged RICO enterprise was located abroad."
395,23," Although it is conceivable that we could retain jurisdiction over this claim by virtue of diversity of citizenship, we need not 
consider this ground because plaintiffs have not pled it. HN41[
] ""It is the plaintiff's burden to plead and prove subject matter 
jurisdiction."" Moses v. Deutche Bank Nat. Trust Co., No. 11-cv-5002 (ENV) (VVP), 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 155310, 2012 WL 
2017706, at *1 (E.D.N.Y. June 5, 2012) (citing Standard Chartered Bank Malaysia Holdings v. Lehman Bros. Asia Holdings Ltd., "
396,," No. 08 CV 8152, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 74486, 2008 WL 4355355, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 22, 2008)). Here, plaintiffs have not 
pleaded that this Court has diversity jurisdiction  [**197] over their state law claim, nor have they alleged facts that would support 
our exercise of diversity jurisdiction. Therefore, if we have jurisdiction over plaintiffs' state-law claim, it is not by virtue of diversity 
of citizenship."
396,24," Like the OTC plaintiffs, the Schwab plaintiffs do not allege that we have diversity jurisdiction, nor do they allege facts that 
would support our exercise of diversity jurisdiction. See Schwab Bank Am. Compl. ¶ 14; Schwab Money Am. Compl. ¶ 14; 
Schwab Bond Am. Compl. ¶ 14. Therefore, we need not consider whether we have jurisdiction over plaintiffs' state-law claims by 
virtue of diversity. "
397,25," Although the amended complaint does not specify which state's law the plaintiffs are seeking to apply, the parties have 
assumed for purposes of briefing that the claim is asserted pursuant to New York common law. Accordingly, we will analyze this 
claim under New York law. "
402,1," While the substance of Defendant's argument in the Opening Memorandum could be read as applying to both the § 1 and § 2 
conspiracy claims, Defendant explicitly rejected such a reading of the argument in its Reply Memorandum. Def.'s Reply Mem. 
Law Further Supp. Mot. Dismiss (""Def.'s Reply Mem."") 9-10, Doc. 21."
402,2," Defendant seeks to have the Court take judicial notice of two pending state court actions and a number of documents filed as 
exhibits in support of its motion to dismiss, and to thereafter rely on those materials to dismiss Plaintiffs' claims. See Def.'s Mem. 
5. Whether or not the existence of the submitted documents are a proper subject of judicial notice, the facts contained therein, 
which Defendant seeks to offer for their truth, are most certainly  [*9] not. See Fed. R. Evid. 201; see also, e.g., Global Network 
Commc'ns, 458 F.3d at 157 (citations omitted). Therefore, the Court has excluded all extrinsic materials submitted by the parties, 
and disregarded arguments based on materials outside the pleadings in deciding the instant motion, as such arguments are 
clearly improper in the context of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(d); see also Global Network 
Commc'ns, 458 F.3d at 156 (holding that district court committed reversible error when, in ruling on a motion to dismiss, it 
considered matters outside the plaintiff's complaint, and relied on those external materials ""to make a finding of fact that 
controverted the plaintiff's [] factual assertions set out in its complaint."" (citation omitted)). "
403,3," However, the Court notes that ""a relevant market definition is not a necessary component of a monopolization claim"" where 
there is direct evidence of monopoly power. PepsiCo, Inc., 315 F.3d at 107-08;  [*13] see also F.T.C. v. Ind. Fed'n of Dentists, 
476 U.S. 447, 460-61, 106 S. Ct. 2009, 90 L. Ed. 2d 445 (1986) (explaining, in a Section 1 Rule of Reason case, that ""[s]ince the 
purpose of the inquiries into market definition and market power is to determine whether an arrangement has the potential for 
genuine adverse effects on competition, proof of actual detrimental effects . . . can obviate the need for an inquiry into market 
power, which is but a surrogate for detrimental effects."" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Additionally, since 
""specific intent to monopolize, and not monopoly power, is the essential element when a conspiracy to monopolize is involved,"" 
Hudson Valley Asbestos Corp. v. Tougher Heating & Plumbing Co., 510 F.2d 1140, 1144 (2d Cir. 1975) (citation omitted), a 
relevant market definition is not a necessary element of a Section 2 conspiracy claim, though ""the relevant market and the 
likelihood of its monopolization may have a significant bearing on whether the requisite specific intent to monopolize is present."" 
Emigra Grp., LLC v. Fragomen, Del Rey, Bernsen & Loewy, LLP, 612 F. Supp. 2d 330, 340 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (citations omitted)."
403,4," Defendant argues for the first time in its Reply Memorandum  [*14] that the Amended Complaint ""lacks the necessary factual 
allegations concerning reasonable interchangeability,"" in relation to the relevant product market, without any discussion of the 
allegations in the Amended Complaint. Def.'s Reply Mem. 2. It is well-established that a party cannot assert an argument for the 
first time in a reply brief; thus, the Court has not considered the merits of this assertion. See, e.g., Evangelista v. Ashcroft, 359 "
404,," F.3d 145, 156 n.4 (2d Cir. 2004) (""'[W]e will not consider an argument raised for the first time in a reply brief.'"" (quoting United 
States v. Yousef, 327 F.3d 56, 115 (2d Cir. 2003))."
404,5," For simplicity, the Court  [*17] refers to the first three markets as the Bronx market, the Flushing market and the Quincy market, 
respectively. Although Plaintiffs refer only to the Bronx, Flushing and Quincy markets in opposing Defendant's Motion to Dismiss, 
Pls.' Mem. 3, 6, Plaintiffs did not abandon the fourth alleged relevant market, because they defend it in their Opposition to 
Defendant's Motion to Strike. See Pls.' Mem. Opp. Mot. Strike 2-3, Doc. 15. "
405,6," Although Plaintiffs don't explicitly dispute Defendant's contention that monopoly or market power is an essential element for 
each of their causes of action, the Court notes that monopoly power is not a necessary element of a conspiracy to monopolize 
claim. See supra note 3. Additionally, the Second Circuit has ""not required  [*20] proof of market power in § 1 cases,"" because 
""[i]f plaintiff can demonstrate an actual adverse effect on competition, such as reduced output, there is no need to show market 
power in addition."" Geneva Pharms., 386 F.3d at 509 (internal citations omitted)."
405,7," The Court has likewise disregarded Plaintiffs' arguments in response to Defendant's assertions, to the extent they are based on 
extrinsic materials. See Pls.' Mem. 8."
405,8," Since the ""willful acquisition or possession of monopoly power"" element of a monopolization claim is generally plead by alleging 
anticompetitive conduct, the Court addresses the second element of Plaintiffs' monopolization claim and the ""anticompetitive 
conduct"" element of Plaintiffs' attempted monopolization claim together. With respect to the remaining element of Plaintiffs' claim 
of attempted monopolization—a specific intent to monopolize or destroy competition—the Second Circuit has explained that 
courts may infer a specific intent to monopolize from allegations of anticompetitive conduct. Volvo N. Am. Corp. v. Men's Int'l 
Prof'l Tennis Council, 857 F.2d 55, 74 (2d Cir. 1988) (citation omitted). "
406,9," As noted above, Defendant's arguments suffer from myriad deficiencies; however, in the interest of conserving judicial 
resources, and because Plaintiffs are granted leave to replead, the Court has not included in this opinion a detailed explanation 
of why each of Defendant's arguments are without merit."
406,10," For example, Plaintiffs' definition of the relevant product market excludes HHD, see Am. Compl. ¶¶ 31, 34-35, 43, but Plaintiffs 
rely on alleged anticompetitive conduct in the HHD market to support their antitrust claims. Id. ¶¶ 164-75. Additionally, Plaintiffs 
allege that Davita prevented competitors from entering the relevant markets by charging lower prices than competitors could "
407,," sustain, id. ¶ 72, and also allege that DaVita's alleged conduct adversely affected competition in the relevant markets in the form 
of, inter alia, ""prices above competitive levels."" Id. ¶ 5. While the Court has accepted all of Plaintiffs' factual allegations as true 
for purposes of deciding the instant motion, Plaintiffs would be well-served by clarifying these and other seemingly inconsistent 
allegations, should they choose to file a Second Amended Complaint."
407,11," The Third Circuit cases relied on by Plaintiffs to support their argument to the contrary involve—as Defendants emphatically 
noted in their Reply Memorandum—conspiracy claims under Section 1. See Def.'s Reply Mem. 9-10. Defendant's vehement 
reaction to Plaintiffs' reliance on Section 1 conspiracy  [*29] cases seems unwarranted especially since Defendant cited to a 
case involving a Section 1 conspiracy claim in their opening memorandum. See Def.'s Mem. 14. The district court case cited by 
Plaintiffs—which Defendant didn't address in its Reply—is a section 2 case; however, the authority cited therein involved a 
Section 1 conspiracy. Although conspiracies under Section 1 and Section 2 are not ""wholly different,"" as Defendant asserts, 
Def.'s Reply Mem. 9, the Second Circuit has recognized a distinction between the two as regards the specific intent element. 
See Int'l Distrib. Ctrs., Inc. v. Walsh Trucking Co., 812 F.2d 786, 793 (2d Cir. 1987) (""Unlike the proof required to establish a 
conspiracy to monopolize under section 2, a specific intent to create a monopoly is not required under section 1,"" though a 
section 1 claim does require ""a unity of purpose or a common design and understanding, or a meeting of minds in an unlawful 
arrangement"" (citations and internal quotation marks omitted)). "
413,1," In Glen Holly, the Ninth Circuit articulates this part of the ""antitrust injury"" definition as having four elements: ""(1) unlawful 
conduct,  [**10] (2) causing an injury to the plaintiff, (3) that flows from that which makes the conduct unlawful, and (4) that is of 
the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent."" 352 F.3d at 372 (quoting Am. Ad Mgmt, Inc. v. Gen. Telephone Co., 190 
F.3d 1051, 1055 (9th Cir. 1999)). "

Palms. Compl. ¶ 4."
419,3," Defendants have requested that the Court take judicial notice of the Sunline  [*3] Transit Agency Joint Powers Agreement and 
well as the Sunline Services Group Joint Powers Agreement. Under Federal Rule of Evidence 201, the Court can take judicial 
notice of ""a fact that is not subject to reasonable dispute because it . . . can be accurately and readily determined from sources 
whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned."" See Fed. R. Evid. 201. Given that these documents were executed by public 
officials from the Municipalities, they fall within the scope of public records, and they have been included in the Statement of 
Undisputed Facts, the Court would GRANT Defendants' Request for Judicial Notice."
419,4," It is unlawful for any taxicab vehicle to (1) operate in the jurisdiction of SSG without a properly issued SSG Vehicle Inspection 
Sticker; (2) operate more vehicles than the total number of non-temporary taxicab permits; or (3) operate more vehicles than the 
valid temporary taxicab permits issued to the franchisee. SSG Ordinance No. 2012-01 § 1.091. "
420,5," Defendants argue that these remedies implicate both the Political Question and Separation of Powers doctrines. See Def. 
Reply, Docket No. 30, at 13-15. "
421,6," Unlike private parties, substate public entities are not subject to the ""active state supervision requirement"" due to the 
diminished incentive to pursue their own self-interest under the pretense of implementing state policies. Phoebe, 133 S. Ct. at 
1011 (quoting Hallie v. Eau Claire, 471 U.S. 34, 46-47, 105 S. Ct. 1713, 85 L. Ed. 2d 24 (1985)). "
422,7," Section 5353(g) provides that the Act ""does not apply to . . . [t]axicab transportation service licensed and regulated by a city or 
county, by ordinance or resolution, rendered in vehicles designed for carrying not more than eight persons excluding the driver."" 
Despite this exclusionary language, the Ninth Circuit has interpreted the provision to mean that ""under Section 5353(g), if a city 
does not license or regulate taxicabs, the state commission has the authority to do it."" Golden State Transit, 726 F.2d at 1434 
(emphasis in original). But because ""taxicabs fit squarely within the statutory definition of a carrier subject to state regulation 
 [*14] [see § 5360],"" the Ninth Circuit views taxicabs as covered by the Charter-Party Carriers' Act. Id."
422,8," Moreover, pursuant to the Joint Exercise of Powers Act, a joint powers authority may exercise ""any power common to the

452,14," Section  [**39] III.A of the Commission's final order is titled ""Application of Code of Conduct to Jurisdictional Sellers,"" and 
paragraphs 14-22 discuss the scope of FERC's jurisdiction over the natural gas industry."
452,15," The EPA provides, in relevant part: HN38[
] It shall be unlawful for any entity, directly or indirectly, to use or employ, in connection with the purchase or sale 
of natural gas or the purchase or sale of transportation services  [**40] subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission, any 
manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance. . . . in contravention of such rules and regulations as the Commission may 
prescribe as necessary in the public interest or for the protection of natural gas ratepayers. Pub. L. No. 109-58 tit. III, § 315 (codified at 15 U.S.C. § 717c-1). "
454,16," HN44[
] Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a) provides that a party may amend its pleadings once as a matter of course within certain deadlines, and that in ""all other cases, a party may amend its pleading only with the opposing party's written consent or the 
court's leave. The court should freely give leave when justice so requires."" (emphasis added). "
455,17," The ""AEP Defendants"" are American Electric Power Company (""AEP"") and its subsidiary, AEP Energy Services, Inc 
(""AEPES""). "
456,18, The Arandell Plaintiffs do not argue that the district court could exercise general personal jurisdiction over AEP or AEPES.
456,19," The Heartland Plaintiffs do not argue that the district court could exercise general  [**55] personal jurisdiction over AEP or 
AEPES. "
457,20," HN52[
] The Wisconsin Supreme Court has held that Wisconsin's long-arm statute, Wis. Stat. § 801.05, allows for the exercise of jurisdiction to the full extent allowed by the due process clause. See Rasmussen v. General Motors Corp., 2011 WI 
52, 335 Wis. 2d 1, 803 N.W.2d 623, 630 (Wis. 2011) (stating that ""§ 801.05 was intended to provide for the exercise of 
jurisdiction over nonresident defendants to the full extent consistent with the requisites of due process of law"") (internal citations 
omitted). The ""jurisdictional inquiries under state law and federal due process merge into one analysis"" when, as here, the 
state's long-arm statute is ""coextensive with federal due process requirements."" Roth v. Garcia Marquez, 942 F.2d 617, 620 (9th 
Cir. 1991). HN53[
] In Missouri, however, the Missouri Supreme Court has held that there are two separate inquiries: ""one 
inquiry to establish if a defendant's conduct was covered by the long-arm statute, and a second inquiry to analyze 
 [**58] whether the exercise of jurisdiction comports with due process requirements."" Myers v. Casino Queen, Inc., 689 F.3d 
904, 909 (8th Cir. 2012) (citing Bryant v. Smith Interior Design Grp., Inc., 310 S.W.3d 227, 231 (Mo. 2010)). "
458,21," The district court assumed, without expressly deciding, that AEPES's sales to Wisconsin- and Missouri-based entities and 
delivery of natural gas to the forum were sufficient to satisfy the ""purposeful availment"" prong of the specific jurisdiction inquiry. 
Because it found that Plaintiffs failed to show that their claims arose out of AEPES's contacts with Wisconsin and Missouri, it did 
not address the third prong of the specific jurisdiction inquiry (whether the exercise of jurisdiction would be reasonable)."
458,22," See Doe v. American Nat'l Red Cross, 112 F.3d 1048, 1051 n.7 (9th Cir. 1997) (noting that even after the Supreme Court's 
decision in Shute, ""the 'but for' test is still employed in determining whether a plaintiff's injuries arose out of the defendant's 
forum-related activities."")."
458,23," For example, the Arandell Plaintiffs allege, ""The actions of the defendants resulted in the plaintiffs paying inflated prices for 
natural gas during the Relevant Time Period. During the Relevant Time Period, natural gas prices in Wisconsin more than 
doubled. The plaintiffs paid higher prices for natural gas than they otherwise would have paid if the defendants' conspiracy had 
not existed."" "
459,24," The plaintiff in Calder was an entertainer who lived and worked in California. 465 U.S. at 785. She brought suit in California 
state court against the National Enquirer after the tabloid published a story alleging that the plaintiff had an alcohol problem. Id. 
at 784, 788 n.9. The article was written in Florida, and the National Enquirer was published in Florida with a large circulation in 
California. Id. at 785. The California courts ""concluded that a valid basis for jurisdiction existed on the theory that [the 
defendants] intended to, and did, cause tortious injury to [the plaintiff] in California."" Id. at 787. The Supreme Court affirmed, 
holding that jurisdiction in California was proper because the defendants' intentional conduct in Florida was calculated to cause 
injury to the plaintiff in California. Id. at 791."
459,25," HN59[
] This court has recently defined ""intentional act"" as ""an  [**65] external manifestation of the actor's intent to perform 
an actual, physical act in the real world, not including any of its actual or intended results."" Washington Shoe, 704 F.3d at 674."
459,26," ""We have repeatedly stated that HN60[
] the 'express aiming' requirement is satisfied, and specific jurisdiction exists, when 
the defendant is alleged to have engaged in wrongful conduct targeted at a plaintiff whom the defendant knows to be a resident 
of the forum state."" Washington Shoe, 704 F.3d at 675 (internal quotation marks omitted). "
460,27," The Heartland Plaintiffs' opening brief states, ""the Heartland plaintiffs are appealing the District Court's dismissal of one 
defendant — AEP Energy Services, Inc. — from that case for lack of personal jurisdiction."""
460,28," The Plaintiffs have filed a Motion to Certify Question of Wisconsin State Law to the Wisconsin Supreme Court. Because we 
find that the plain text of Wisconsin Statutes § 133.14 is clear, we do not believe that certification  [**71] is necessary as a "
461,," ""means to obtain authoritative answers to unclear questions of state law,"" and we therefore deny the motion. Toner v. Lederle 
Labs., Div. of Amer. Cyanamid Co., 779 F.2d 1429, 1432 (9th Cir. 1986)."
461,29," This is in contrast to HN71[
] Section 133.18, which does permit indirect purchasers to recover treble damages. See Wis. Stat. § 133.18 (providing, in relevant part, that ""any person injured, directly or indirectly, by reason of anything prohibited buy this 
chapter may sue therefor and shall recover threefold the damages sustained by the person"") (emphasis added). "
462,30, The parties shall bear their own costs on appeal. 
467,1," A satellite-based platform has advantages in that it ""allows airlines to offer uninterrupted broadband service across national 
boundaries, over oceans, and even in more remote regions of the world. By contrast, Gogo's service, being dependent on land-
based cellular towers is limited in its coverage to the region where Gogo has land-based towers installed."" FAC ¶ 16. "
469,2," In its reply brief, Gogo does make a new argument in which it disputes the market definition - more specifically, its geographic 
component. See Reply at 6 n.4. The Court does not entertain this argument because it was not raised in the opening brief. "
470,3," At the hearing, Plaintiffs noted that a large market share was only one way to prove market power; another way to establish 
market power would be to provide evidence of restricted output and supracompetitive prices. See Theme Promotions, Inc. v. 
News Am. Mktg. FSI, 546 F.3d 991, 1001 (9th Cir. 2010) (noting that, ""[t]o establish circumstantial evidence of market power, a 
plaintiff must first define the relevant market and then show that the defendant plays enough of a role in the market to impair 
competition significantly"" but that ""[e]vidence of restricted output and supracompetitive prices is direct evidence of market 
power""). But the complaint, while it contains allegations pointing to supracompetitive prices, does not contain accompanying 
allegations of restricted output. "
471,4," Because the Court is dismissing for the  [*17] above-stated reasons, it need not at this juncture address Gogo's contention that 
there are insufficient allegations of standing or antitrust injury. "
473,1," One motion to dismiss was filed jointly by defendants Pool Corporation, SCP Distributors LLC, and Superior Pool Products 
(collectively the ""Pool Defendants"", ""PoolCorp"", or ""Pool""); a second motion to dismiss was filed jointly by Hayward Industries,

that if they sold to ATX, PoolCorp would send their products back""; ""One member of PoolCorp's Preferred Vendor Program,

505,1," At oral argument, Plaintiff's counsel also referred the Court to Klor's, Inc. v. Broadway-Hale Stores, Inc., 359 U.S. 207, 79 S. Ct. 
705, 3 L. Ed. 2d 741 (1959). In that case, the plaintiff alleged that a group of stores had reached a concerted agreement, and 
""defendants did not dispute these allegations."" Id. at 209. Instead, the defendants sought and won a summary judgment holding 
that, even if some concerted agreement had been reached, it did not harm competition sufficiently to amount to an antitrust 
violation. Id.at 210-11. In reversing the lower courts on this point, the Supreme Court did not address the question of the facts 
necessary to plead a claim of a horizontal conspiracy. "
507,2," To avoid this result, Plaintiff's counsel, at oral argument, again cited Klor's, 359 U.S. at 207. But Klor's was not a ""rule of 
reason"" case. Rather, it was the case that ""set forth the rule"" that unlawful group boycotts are a per se violation of Section 1. 
Discon, 525 U.S. at 128. Therefore, Klor's does not absolve a ""rule of reason"" claimant of its obligation to plead harm to 
competition. "
519,1," Plaintiffs are Nadia and Sean Roberts (the ""Roberts""), Bernhard and Heidi Gubser (the ""Gubsers""), Anton Ginzburg (""Mr. 
Ginzburg""), Arthur Joel Eisenberg (""Mr. Eisenberg""), Jeffrey Chernick (""Mr. Chernick"") and Mr. Chernick's Liberian corporation 
Shumba and Hong Kong corporation Simba, and all plaintiffs will be referred to collectively as ""plaintiffs."""
519,2, The factual recitation summarizes the SAC and is derived from other matters which this Court may consider.
519,3," These defendants and UBS AG will be referred to collectively as ""defendants."""
519,4," UBS AG notes that the IRS established the QI Program to require financial institutions to identify and withhold tax on U.S. 
source income paid to foreign bank accounts, including income generated by U.S. securities, real estate and other investments. 
UBS AG further notes that the QI Agreement ""does not create any obligations in favor of accountholders."" "
523,5," The ""UBS AG Defendants"" include UBS AG and most of the10 other defendants named in the SAC. "
529,6," RICO refers to the Racketeer and Corrupt Practices Act (""RICO""), 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961, et seq. "
538,1," The facts in this section are drawn primarily from the amended complaint (Doc. No. 8) and SHB's objection to defendants' 
motion to dismiss (Doc. No. 9) and are considered in the light most favorable to the plaintiff."
538,2," There may be more email correspondence than that listed on the exhibits because a computer virus deleted some of SHB's 
emails from 2010. Doc. No. 14."
538,3," Coincidentally, Peter Semenoff and Debra Mangum were communicating with people named Peter and Deborah at SHB. "
540,4," The Lanham Act does not have a provision authorizing nationwide service of process, therefore SHB does not base its claim to 
personal jurisdiction on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(k)(1)(C). Instead, they base their claim to personal jurisdiction on 
4(k)(1)(A), that the defendants are ""subject to the jurisdiction of a court of general jurisdiction in the state where the district court 
is located."" Accordingly, I analyze personal jurisdiction under the New Hampshire long-arm statute, which authorizes jurisdiction 
to extend as broadly as possible to satisfy constitutional requirements. "
541,5," The parties do not discuss personal jurisdiction with regard to each claim, but instead discuss it with regards to the claims 
collectively. I analyze personal jurisdiction only for SHB's Lanham Act claim. In addition to the Lanham Act claim, SHB also 
asserts state law claims for unfair competition and tortious interference with business. I need not decide whether SHB has 
established jurisdiction over the defendants with respect to those claims because, finding personal jurisdiction over the Lanham 
Act claim, I will exercise pendent personal jurisdiction over the state law claims since they arise out of the same common 
nucleus of operative fact as the Lanham Act claim. See Wilcox Indus. Corp. v. Hansen, 11-CV-551-PB, 2012 WL 1246146, *7 
(D.N.H. Apr. 13, 2012); 4A Charles  [*14] Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1069.7 (3d ed. 2010). 
See also Action Embroidery Corp. v. Atlantic Embroidery, Inc., 368 F.3d 1174, 1181 (9th Cir. 2004); United States v. Botefuhr, 
309 F.3d 1263, 1273 (10th Cir. 2002). "
543,6," SHB also cites the forum selection clause at the bottom of the invoices as evidence that defendants knew they could be subject 
to suit in New Hampshire. A boilerplate forum selection clause is not sufficient to establish personal jurisdiction, but it is a factor 
that may be considered to ""reinforce . . . the reasonable foreseeability of possible litigation."" Burger King, 471 U.S. at 482. 
Defendants argue that the forum selection clause found on the invoices is limited to claims ""involving this contract"" and therefore 
is inapplicable to the present tort claim. I find that defendants meet the ""purposeful availment"" requirement and therefore do not 
consider the forum selection clause."
543,7," Defendants cite Murphy v. Schneider Nat'l Inc., 362 F.3d 1133, 1142 (9th Cir. 2004) for the proposition that a combination of 
physical and financial hardships may effectively deprive a party of his or her day in court. Murphy, however is inapposite 
because it addresses venue, not personal jurisdiction. "
545,8," SHB errs in relying on 28 U.S.C. § 1400(a), the venue provision for ""patents and copyrights, mask works, and designs."" "
546,9," Defendants incorrectly cite Zenith Electronics Corp.  [*32] v. Exzec, Inc. for the proposition that a plaintiff must allege bad faith 
in a Lanham Act claim if the marketplace statements are about having a patent. 182 F.3d 1340 (Fed. Cir. 1999). In Zenith, the 
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held that ""before a patentee may be held liable under § 43(a) for marketplace activity in 
support of its patent, and thus be deprived of the right to make statements about potential infringement of its patent, the 
marketplace activity must have been undertaken in bad faith."" Id. at 1353. The court was concerned that the Lanham Act may 
conflict with the patent laws when an accused patent infringer attempts to use antitrust law to frustrate an honest patentee's 
right to enforce a patent. Zenith is not on point in this case because defendants do not hold a valid patent. I do not decide 
whether there is a bad faith requirement for ""patent pending"" claims under the Lanham Act. The patent pending claims are only 
one of several alleged violations of the Lanham Act. "
550,1," Also pending before the Court is St. Jude's motion to dismiss Count I of the counterclaim the University filed in response to the 
Tennessee action, now consolidated here. In a December 14, 2012 epistolary submission to the Court, St. Jude asks us to 
consider the motions to dismiss together because they are ""essentially identical."" We will do so, and our analysis here will apply 
to St. Jude's motion to dismiss the University's counterclaim as well."
550,2," The University alleges that Dr. Campana no longer works at St. Jude and currently serves as a professor at the National 
University of Singapore, Department of Pediatrics.  [**4] Am. Comp. ¶ 14."
550,3," We refer to this agreement,  [**5] as the parties do, as the 2007 agreement. "
551,4," In its amended complaint, the University says this letter informed St. Jude it wished to terminate the 2003 MTA, but the letter 
refers to the 2007 MTA in its subject line and does not make clear which MTA the University seeks to terminate. The distinction 
does not affect our decision here. "
553,5," With regard to whose substantive law Pennsylvania's choice of law rules would direct us to use, St. Jude contends that where a 
party alleges the tortious filing of a lawsuit ""Pennsylvania courts have generally applied the law of the state in which the allegedly 
wrongful litigation was filed."" MTD at 24. (citing, inter alia, Rosen v. Tesoro Petroleum Corp., 399 Pa. Super. 226, 582 A.2d 27, 
31 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1990)). The University argues that the Pennsylvania conflicts-of-law analysis focuses on which state has the greater interest in the 
application of its law, see Univ. Resp. at 23 n.5 (citing Toledo Mack Sales & Serv. v. Mack Trucks, Inc., No. Civ. 02-CV-4373, 
2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11052, 2005 WL 724117, at *11 (E.D. Pa. Mar. 29, 2005)), and that Pennsylvania courts considering 
tortious interference claims ""have routinely found that the state with the greatest interest in application of its law is the state 
where the business relationship at issue transpires."" Id. (emphasis in original) (citing KDH Electronic Systems, Inc. v. Curtis 
Tech. Ltd., 826 F. Supp. 2d 782, 801 (E.D. Pa. 2011)).  [**13] The University concludes that ""[n]o part of the business 
relationship involves Tennessee"" and so ""Pennsylvania has the greatest interest in application of its laws under Pennsylvania 
conflicts of law principles."" Id. As we discuss, there is no true conflict between Tennessee and Pennsylvania law on tortious interference with contractual 
relations. "
555,6," Of late the breadth of this holding has not gone unquestioned. In Borough of Duryea v. Guarnieri, 131 S. Ct. 2488, 180 L. Ed. 
2d 408 (2011), Justices Scalia and Thomas expressed doubt in their concurring opinions that the Petition Clause encompasses 
lawsuits. See id. at 2503 (Scalia, J., concurring) (""I find the proposition that a lawsuit is a constitutionally protected 'Petition' quite 
doubtful""). But as Justice Kennedy, writing for the seven-Justice majority in Guarnieri, explained, ""[t]his Court's precedents 
confirm that the Petition Clause protects the right of individuals to appeal to courts and other forums established by the 
government for resolution of legal disputes."" Id. at 2494 (quoting, inter alia, Sure-Tan, Inc. v. NLRB, 467 U.S. 883, 896-97, 104 
S. Ct. 2803, 81 L. Ed. 2d 732 (1984), for the proposition that ""the right of access to courts for redress of wrongs is an aspect of 
the First Amendment  [**20] right to petition the government.""). We thus conclude that Guarnieri does not foreclose the 
application of Noerr-Pennington to petitions that take the form of lawsuits. "
556,7," Adams Golf is also distinguishable from this case in that in that case the defendant bore the burden of proving the asserted 
defense, loss causation. The plaintiffs had brought an action alleging materially false or misleading statements in violation of 
Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933. Those Sections do not require a plaintiff to prove loss causation in order 
to state a claim, but a defendant may argue as an affirmative defense that any misstatements did not cause a loss. See Adams 
Golf, 381 F.3d at 277. Our Court  [**23] of Appeals found that the district court had improperly granted the defendant's motion to 
dismiss based on this affirmative defense because ""[u]nder sections 11 and 12(a)(2), plaintiffs do not bear the burden of proving 
causation."" Adams Golf, 381 F.3d at 277. A Noerr-Pennington defense differs from the negative causation defense at issue in Adams Golf in that under Noerr-Pennington 
the plaintiff bears the burden of proving that the petitioning activity is a sham undeserving of Noerr-Pennington protection. As the 
Supreme Court explained in PRE, because ""[t]he existence of probable cause to institute legal proceedings precludes a finding 
that an antitrust defendant has engaged in sham litigation"", proving that litigation is a sham ""requires the plaintiff to prove that 
the defendant lacked probable cause to institute an unsuccessful civil lawsuit and that the defendant pressed the action for an 
improper, malicious purpose"", PRE, 508 U.S. at 62. See also In re Flonase Antitrust Litig., 795 F. Supp. 2d 300, 311 (E.D. Pa. 
2011) (""under PRE, the burden falls on the party invoking the sham exception, here the Plaintiffs, to show that the conduct at 
issue constitutes a sham"")."
556,8," Cheminor confirms that courts may in some cases make Noerr-Pennington determinations as a matter of law. There, our Court 
of Appeals affirmed the grant of summary judgment with regard to state tort claims on the basis that such claims were barred by 
Noerr-Pennington. See Cheminor, 168 F.3d at 128-29. "
562,1," Hansol also moves to be dismissed from this suit due to improper service of process. Hansol raised this argument in an earlier 
motion to dismiss, and its current argument does not materially differ from the argument it raised in its earlier motion. 
Consequently, this motion is denied for the reasons set out in the Court's prior order. See Dkt. #38 at 6 - 7."
562,2," In its complaint, plaintiff alleges that 8 Net's payments were guaranteed by a ""line of credit."" In its motion to dismiss, defendants 
clarify that the payments were actually guaranteed by letters of credit. "
564,3," The Robinson-Patman Act provides that ""nothing herein contained shall prevent differentials which make only due allowance 
for differences in the cost of manufacture, sale, or delivery resulting from the differing methods or quantities in which such 
commodities are to such purchasers sold or delivered."" 15 U.S.C. § 13(a). This language gives rise to the cost justification 
defense. As the Supreme Court observed in Hasbrouck, ""the burden of proof with respect to the [cost justification] defense is "
565,," upon the supplier, and interposing the defense 'has proven difficult, expensive, and often unsuccessful.'"" Hasbrouck, 496 U.S. at 
561 n. 18 (quoting 3 E. Kinter & J. Bauer, Federal Antitrust Law § 23.19 pp. 366-367 (1983)). "
566,4," Defendants also argue that plaintiff bears the burden of pleading that the price difference cannot be explained by the fact that 8 
Net's purchases, but not plaintiff's, were guaranteed by a letter of credit. It is unclear to the Court why this burden should be 
plaintiff's. Ultimately, defendants' position is that Global faces additional costs by selling to a purchaser who cannot guarantee 
payment, and that passing these charges on to the purchaser is not unlawful. Since these costs arise out of the method through 
which Global sold paper to plaintiff, defendants' argument appears to be a cost justification defense, which must be pled and 
proven by defendants. See 15 U.S.C. § 13(a) (""[N]othing herein contained shall prevent differentials which make only due 
allowance for differences in the cost of manufacture, sale, or delivery resulting from the differing methods or quantities in which 
such commodities are to such purchasers sold or delivered.""). The Court need not [*17]  decide this issue to resolve the instant 
motion because plaintiff has not explained why 8 Net's price is unreasonable in light of the fact that 8 Net, but not plaintiff, bore 
the risk of loss, but the Court raises the issue nonetheless for the parties to address in future pleadings."
566,5," Plaintiff's complaint mentions two other firms that distribute Hansol's paper in the Southwestern United States: Unisource and 
Cellmark/Performance. These firms also allegedly purchase Hansol's paper through Global on DDP terms of sale. SAC ¶ 25. 
Plaintiff alleges that Cellmark/Performance paid ten percent less than plaintiff at some point between 2009 and 2012, but does 
not allege how much Unisource paid. See id. ¶ 24. Moreover, plaintiff makes no other allegations comparing 
Cellmark/Performance's terms of sale and its own terms of sale. Consequently, based on the preceding analysis, plaintiff has not 
plausibly pled that any discounts given to these competitors amount to actionable price discrimination. "
569,1," That appeal is currently held in abeyance pending this Court's  [*3] resolution of yet another case involving these parties. B&S 
Telecom Inc v Michigan Bell Tel Co, unpublished order of the Court of Appeals, issued March 6, 2012 (Docket No. 300236), 
citing Michigan Bell Tel Co v B&S Telecom Inc (Docket No. 307199, Case No. U-16501). "
570,2," In contrast, finality for purposes of application  [*7] of the issue-preclusion doctrine, collateral estoppel, requires that ""all 
appeals have been exhausted."" Leahy v Orion Twp, 269 Mich App 527, 530; 711 NW2d 438 (2006)."
570,3," Defendant sells its own telecommunication service to consumers, while plaintiff resells defendant's service at wholesale to 
consumers. "
582,1, Defendants assert that the Complaint incorrectly identifies General Motors LLC as General Motors Company.
582,2," As will be addressed, infra, AVC is the ""appropriate measure of cost"" for a predatory pricing claim under the prevailing Fifth 
Circuit standards. Since Felder's' Complaint incorrectly  [**5] defines AVC, the formula offered in the Complaint is not included in 
the statement of facts in an attempt to minimize confusion. "
583,3," Although Felder's provides three examples of this pricing program, only one will be repeated here. "
584,4," HN3[
] Two basic types of injury are recognized under RPA: primary-line injury and secondary-line injury. Infusion, 351 F.3d at 692. A primary-line injury results when one seller's acts of price discrimination between favored and disfavored buyers results 
in an injury  [**9] to a market player competing at the same level of direct competition. Water Craft, 361 F. Supp. 2d at 565. A 
secondary-line injury results from a seller's price discrimination between favored and disfavored buyers. Infusion, 351 F.3d at 
692."
584,5," According to the Complaint, Defendants ""have colluded and conspired to and have engaged in the below cost predatory pricing 
described herein in an attempt to monopolize the sale of collision repair parts in southern Louisiana and Mississippi."" (Doc. 1 at 
13)."
584,6," As Defendants state in their Motion to Dismiss, ""To state an attempt to monopolize claim: a plaintiff must prove (1) that the 
defendant has engaged in predatory or anticompetitive conduct with (2) a specific intent to monopolize and (3) a dangerous 
probability of achieving monopoly power."" (Doc. 22-1 at 11)."
584,7," According to Felder's' opposition, ""A claim for monopolization under the Sherman Act requires proof of (1) predatory or anti-
competitive conduction; (2) specific intent to monopolize; and (3) dangerous probability of achieving monopoly power."" (Doc. 25 
at 10). "
585,8," According to the Supreme Court, in Brooke Group: There are, to be sure, differences between the two statutes. For example, we interpret § 2 of the Sherman Act to condemn 
predatory pricing when it poses 'a dangerous probability of actual monopolization,' whereas the Robinson—Patman Act 
requires only that there be 'a reasonable possibility' of substantial injury to competition before its protections are triggered.... Brooke Group, 509 U.S. at 222 (citation omitted)."
585,9," For example, hiring away a competitor's employees may be unlawful under § 2 of  [**13] the Sherman Act, Taylor Pub., 216 
F.3d at 480 n.11; but the lack of price discrimination renders the same not violative of the RPA."
585,10," Where price discrimination is not alleged, as required by the third element, the Court must also conclude that fourth element is 
deficiently pled because, by its terms, the RPA ""condemns price discrimination only to the extent that it threatens to injure 
competition."" Brooke Group, 509 U.S. at 220."
585,11," The Court reiterates that the elements for attempted monopolization will be applied to the § 2 claim. Supra, p. 6. "
586,12," Here, for example, an analysis of market power would vary depending upon whether the product market is defined as a 
market for ""auto parts"" or, alternatively, a market for ""collision parts compatible with GM automobiles for which there is an 
aftermarket alternative."""
586,13," According to the Fifth Circuit, HN11[
] Whether a relevant market has been identified is usually a question of fact; however, in some circumstances, the 
issue may be determined as a matter of law. Where the plaintiff fails to define its proposed relevant market with reference 
to the rule of reasonable interchangeability and cross-elasticity of demand, or alleges a proposed relevant market that 
clearly does not encompass all interchangeable substitute products even when all factual inferences are granted in 
plaintiff's favor, the relevant market is legally insufficient, and a motion to dismiss may be granted. Apani, 300 F.3d at 628 (internal quotations and citations omitted). "
588,14," As the Fifth Circuit has explained: We do not suggest here a market share percentage that of itself rises to the level of legal significance, but note that HN15[ ] a share of less than the fifty percent generally required for actual monopolization may support a claim for attempted 
monopolization if other factors such as concentration of market, high barriers to entry, consumer demand, strength of the 
competition, or consolidation trend in the market are present. Domed Stadium, 732 F.2d at 490."
588,15," The market power analysis, here, assesses market power in light of existing barriers to entry. Notably, barriers to entry are 
also discussed, infra, but the inquiry below assesses the potential existence of future barriers to entry which might contribute to a 
dangerous probability that Defendants will recoup."
588,16," If ""the market"" is the ""automotive parts industry,"" then Defendants' market share is statistically different than it would be if the 
relevant market were defined as ""collision parts compatible with GM vehicles."" This is an illustration of why the Fifth Circuit 
requires definition market of relevant market(s). See supra note 13. "
589,17," While § 2 of the Sherman Act condemns ""predatory pricing when it poses a dangerous probability of actual monopolization,"" 
the RPA ""requires only that there be a reasonable possibility of substantial injury to competition before its protections are 
triggered."" Brooke Group, 509 U.S. at 222 (internal quotations and citations omitted)."
589,18," Accordingly, the recoupment analysis assumes arguendo that below-cost pricing can be established. See FMC Corp., 170 
F.3d at 532 (explaining this procedure for analysis of predatory pricing). "
590,19," See R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. v. Cigarettes Cheaper!, 462 F.3d 690, 696 (7th Cir. 2006) (observing that phrases like ""kill the 
competition"" do not support inference of predatory pricing)."
590,20," All Star's ability to recover profits does not have to do with whether Felder's will be driven out of business, but rather has to do 
with the second prong of the recoupment analysis."
590,21," Felder's actually uses the word ""recoup."" As Defendants correctly point out, this is technically inaccurate, since recoupment 
has to do with recovering lost profits after an alleged predator has driven its competition out of business. HN21[
] The term 
""recoup,"" therefore, properly refers to the ability to recover profits lost  [**35] as a result of below-cost pricing by charging 
supracompetitive prices after other firms have been driven out of business by a predator. Notwithstanding Felder's' technical 
misuse of the term recoup, its point is well taken—that Defendants make money (1) by selling OEM parts that have no 
aftermarket equivalent at high prices, and (2) by selling OEM parts with aftermarket equivalents at prices that undercut 
competition. "
591,22," Since the Court has already stated that Felder's must amend to clarify whether the bankrupted entities competed in the 
relevant market, supra at p. 12-13, the conclusion reached here assumes that the bankrupted entities did in fact compete in the 
relevant market."
591,23, Below cost pricing is addressed infra. 
592,24," To reiterate, here the analysis is unlike the analysis of barriers to entry above, which asks about existing barriers to entry. See 
supra note 15 and accompanying text. The inquiry with respect to recoupment is whether future barriers to entry will exist that 
could influence a defendant's ability to charge supracompetitive prices. "
593,25, Felder's does not allege that GM sold parts below cost in the course of transacting with the Defendant-dealers. 
594,26," Where the challenged prices are above cost, recovery is rare because such claims could set a precedent that may have a 
chilling affect on the type of legitimate price cuts that directly benefit consumers. Weyerhaeuser Co. v. Ross-Simmons 
Hardwood Lumber Co., Inc., 549 U.S. 312, 319, 127 S. Ct. 1069, 166 L. Ed. 2d 911 (2007)."
594,27," For further explanation of costs, see FMC Corp., 170 F.3d at 532. "
595,28," HN29[
] 15 U.S.C. § 15(a) (""[A]ny person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue therefor""); 15 U.S.C. § 26 (providing that private parties ""threatened [with] loss or damage by a 
violation of the antitrust laws"" may seek injunctive relief). "
599,1," Although Defendant moved to dismiss the Complaint  [**2] on the basis of Rule 12(b)(6), the actual issue before the Court is 
not whether the Complaint states a claim for relief or whether jurisdiction is proper pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1). Rather, the 
question is whether the Court should exercise its discretion and hear this action. See Valdese Weavers, Inc. v. Highland Fabrics, 
Inc., Civil No. 1:09cv170, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 112854, 2009 WL 4726640, at *3 (W.D.N.C. Dec. 2, 2009) (Reidinger, J.). "
601,2," As the case law demonstrates, this situation ordinarily arises in the context of disputes regarding insurance coverage. The 
Fourth Circuit, however, has applied similar factors in the non-insurance context where the state court action was filed after the 
federal declaratory judgment action. See J.B. Hunt Transp. Inc. v. Innis, 985 F.2d 553, 1993 WL 13376 (4th Cir. 1993) 
(unpublished);  [**10] see also Valdese Weavers, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 112854, 2009 WL 4726640, at *2-4. "
606,1," The Court granted Defendants leave to add Dunkin' Brands Group Inc. (""DBGI"") and Dunkin' Brands Inc. (""DBI""), as 
Counterclaim Defendants. According to the third amended counterclaim, DBI is ""the franchisor of the Dunkin' system,"" and DBGI 
is the parent corporation of DBI and two Plaintiffs. DBGI and DBI move to dismiss Counts VIII and IX, the only counts in which 
they are named."
606,2," Plaintiffs' separate motion (Doc. No. 91) for summary judgment on all counterclaims will be addressed by separate 
Memorandum and Order."
606,3, The system includes the related Baskin Robbins brand. 
607,4," The suit was filed on February 18, 2011. "
608,5," It is not entirely clear whether the $175,000 was alleged to be part of, or in addition to, the $590,000. "
610,6," As indicated earlier, also pending before the Court is Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment on all counterclaims (Doc. No. 
91). The Court will rule on that motion as an alternative to the motion to dismiss with respect to the antitrust counterclaims. "
613,1," The Complaint defines ""the Walmacs"" to include Walmac Stud, Walmac Farm, and Jones. "
614,2," Schedule I of the SHLA identifies the ownership interests of Ready's Image's Southern Hemisphere co-owners as follows: (1) 
Lincoln-Walmac — 25%; (2) Scatuorchio, LLC — 25%; (3) Kevin J. Scatuorchio — 16%; (4) Courtney Sullivan — 16%; (5) 
Hengst Funding, LLC, d/b/a/ Gaines Gentry Stallion Holdings, a Kentucky Limited Liability Company — 10%; (6) Kerry T. 
Cauthen — 3%; and (7) Four Star Sales, LLC — 5%. [Record No. 72-1, p. 78]"
614,3," Specifically, the SHLA provides that: [F]or each Lease Year of the Lease Term, an amount equivalent to all collected and nonrefundable/non-repayable 
revenues (net of G.S.T.) as a result of the sales of nominations to Ready's Image for each Lease Yar, less an amount equal 
to the greater of (i) Sixty-Five Thousand Dollars U.S. ($65,000.00 U.S.D.), or (ii) ten times the advertised stud fee (net of 
G.S.T.), for one southern hemisphere nomination to Ready's Image during such Lease Year, payable promptly in arrears "
615,," within ninety (90) days following the date of collection of such nonrefundable/non-repayable revenues. Provided however 
Lessee may set  [**9] off from Stallion Rent, any expenses of Ready's Image, which Lessee has paid/advanced and which 
are the responsibility of Lessors hereunder. [Record No. 72-1, p. 68]"
615,4," The plaintiffs allege that procuring mares for Ready's Image to breed with was the responsibility  [**10] of Walmac Stud, as 
Stallion Manager. However, Jones executed the Mare Agreement on behalf of Walmac Farm, instead of Walmac Stud, and the 
plaintiffs contend that Walmac Farm had no ownership interest in, or duty to manage Ready's Image prior to this agreement. 
[Record No. 72 ¶ 71]"
615,5," The plaintiffs filed their initial Verified Complaint in New Jersey Superior Court on April 1, 2011. However, on  [**12] April 19, 
2011, the plaintiffs filed a First Amended Verified Complaint in the Superior Court of New Jersey. [Record Nos. 1-2, 1-11] "
618,6," Section 355.1-304 of the Kentucky Revised Statutes states that: ""[e]very contract or duty within the Uniform Commercial Code 
imposes an obligation of good faith in its performance and enforcement."" KRS § 355.1-304. While the U.C.C. is not controlling 
here, its commentary is instructive. "
619,7," Count Seven was previously ordered to be arbitrated as it pertains to Defendants Walmac Stud and John T. L. Jones III 
pursuant to the Court's  [**25] January 2, 2013 Memorandum Opinion and Order. [Record No. 103, p. 17] "
620,8," The Southern Hemisphere COA provides that the ""[Southern Hemisphere] Co-Owners hereby agree to own, hold and operate 
their rights and interests under the Ready's Image 1/3 Purchase Agreement as tenants in common."" [Record No. 72-1, p. 54] "
621,9," A ""nomination"" is a right to breed a mare to a stallion."
621,10," In accordance with the Court's January 2, 2013 Amended Memorandum Opinion and Order, the plaintiffs' claim of fraudulent 
inducement against the defendants concerning the Sale Agreement was decided adverse to the plaintiffs, and was ordered to be 
arbitrated. [Record No. 103, pp. 9-10, 12;Record No. 109, p. 16 (With respect to the Sale Agreement, Plaintiffs agree with 
Defendants that the Court's prior order already decided that issue adverse to Plaintiffs."")] "
622,11," Walmac Stud is not a party to, nor referenced in, the Mare Agreement. [See Record No. 72-1, pp. 80-81.] The Mare 
Agreement was executed by James T. Scatuorchio, Brian Sullivan, Kevin Scatuorchio, as the ""Original Owners,"" and by John T. 
L. Jones III, as the Managing Director of Walmac Farm, LLC and Stallion Manager for the Ready's Image Co-Owners. [Id.] "
623,12," The defendants also contend that the rule of economic loss precludes the plaintiffs from recovering under a fraud theory 
because this claim arises out of a breach of contract allegation.  [**41] [Record No. 110, p. 6] Specifically the defendants assert 
that ""[u]nder Kentucky law, '[t]he economic loss doctrine precludes a plaintiff from recovering under a fraud theory when that 
claim is intertwined with a breach of contract claim.'"" [Id. (quoting Westlake Vinyls v. Goodrich Corp., 518 F. Supp. 2d 955, 968 
(W.D. Ky. 2007))]. While many courts have applied the economic loss rule to cases applying Kentucky law, the Supreme Court of Kentucky did not 
recognize this doctrine until 2011 in Giddings & Lewis, Inc. v. Indus. Risk Insurers, 348 S.W.3d 729, 733, 738 (Ky. 2011). The 
court, however, limited its application to ""claims arising from a defective product sold in a commercial transaction."" Id. at 733. 
The defendants have not put forth any arguments regarding the appropriateness of applying this rule to the facts of this case. 
However, given the holding of Giddings & Lewis, it would seem improper. "
624,13," The  [**47] plaintiffs have offered no arguments or authorities regarding this issue beyond their assertion that Saybrook is the 
sister company of other defendants in this claim. The plaintiffs then contend that the Court should make the inference that — 
due to its status as a sister company of other defendants — Saybrook has the requisite relationship with the plaintiffs to satisfy 
the threshold issue of an accounting claim. However, the Court is unaware of any case in which a claim for an accounting "
625,," against a sister company was found to be appropriate where there was no contractual or fiduciary relationship between the sister 
company and plaintiff. And more importantly, the plaintiffs have not alleged any facts to plausibly support such an argument."
625,14," The plaintiffs argue that ""[t]o the extent the allegations in the Complaint are unclear as to the nature of this relationship, 
Plaintiffs seek leave to amend to allege additional facts to support such a finding and also state that future discovery may well 
bear out that such a relationship existed."" [Record No. 109, p. 19] This request will neither be granted nor does it save the 
plaintiffs' claim of an accounting against Saybrook. See PR Diamonds, Inc. v. Chandler, 364 F.3d 671, 699, 91 Fed. Appx. 418 
(6th Cir. 2004)  [**48] (noting that a plaintiff's request to amend the pleadings in lieu of a properly filed motion to amend is 
insufficient under Rule 15(a))."
625,15," To the extent the plaintiffs allege a cause of action for conversion arising from the ""negligence"" of the defendants, this claim 
fails as a matter of law. See Ky. Ass'n of Cnty.'s All Lines Fund Trust v. McClendon, 157 S.W.3d 626, 632 (Ky. 2005) 
(""Conversion is an intentional tort and there is no such thing as conversion by accident."") (citations and quotations omitted). "
626,16," The subject property which was allegedly converted is money and not any other type of asset. [Record No. 109, pp. 19-22]"
626,17," The plaintiffs assert that the ""Mare plaintiffs acquired legal title to the proceeds Walmac Farm collected on horses delivered by 
the Mare Plaintiffs under a constructive trust."" [Record No. 109, p. 20] The plaintiffs then allege that ""Walmac Farm cannot . . . 
retain proceeds generated by the Mare Plaintiffs as it had a duty to pay those proceeds to the Mare Plaintiffs under the Mare 
Agreement. The same is true with Lincoln-Walmac and its retention of money due under the Southern Hemisphere Agreements."" 
[Id.] Nowhere in the Complaint or in any of its exhibits is it alleged that a constructive trust exists between the parties. [See 
Record No. 72] In fact, a constructive trust is a remedy in equity. See In re Omegas Group, Inc., 16 F.3d 1443, 1449 (6th Cir. 
1994)  [**54] (noting that a ""constructive trust is merely a means by which the court can say that the defendant must relinquish to 
the plaintiff property that represents an unjust enrichment""); see also Francis, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25195, at *48 (noting that a 
claim of a constructive trust is a remedy for unjust enrichment and denying the plaintiffs' constructive trust claim because his 
unjust enrichment claim had been dismissed). The plaintiffs, however, have not alleged a cause of action for unjust enrichment."
626,18," The plaintiffs concede that the Complaint does not explicitly allege that the plaintiffs made a demand for the ""rightful share of 
money"" that was allegedly owed to them, in satisfaction of the fifth element of a claim for conversion. [Record No. 109, p. 20] 
Instead, they urge the Court to glean from ""a fair reading of the Complaint"" that such a demand is implied. [Id.] The Court will "
627,," decline to do so. Therefore, Count Eleven is also dismissed on the alternative theory for failure to plausibly allege a claim of 
conversion by failing to allege the requisite demand of the subject property."
627,19," The claims in Count Twelve against Walmac Stud and Jones were ordered to be arbitrated pursuant to the Court's January 2, 
2013, Amended Memorandum Opinion and Order. [Record No. 103, pp. 13, 17]"
627,20, There is no dispute over the sale of real estate in this action.
627,21," To the extent the underlying conduct which acts as the basis of the plaintiffs claim for violations of the NJCFA is the same 
conduct which is the predicate to the plaintiffs' fraudulent inducement claims, the Court incorporates its discussion and analysis 
here. "
628,22," In their Response, the plaintiffs identify the following representations as being the predicate for their NJCFA claim: The Walmacs represented that: (a) they could do everything that was necessary to maximize the likelihood of Ready's 
Image's success; (b) [Defendant John T.L. Jones III] owned Walmac Farm, where Ready's Image would reside and be 
bred; (c) Jones was in the business of being a 'stallion manager,' a breeding industry professional responsible for breeding 
and handling stallions; (d) the Walmacs had excellent reputations in the Kentucky thoroughbred breeding community; and 
(e) the Walmacs were on sound financial footing and had the wherewithal to successfully market Ready's Image  [**60] in 
both the Northern and Southern hemispheres, and that they would do so at reasonable rates. The Walmacs also represented that they could expose Ready's Image to a book of more than 100 mares in Ready's 
Image's first breeding season, which — if true — could have generated roughly $1.5 million in stud fees in Ready's Image's 
first year as a stud. A large book of mares in Ready's Image's first year as a stud would have been and remains essential to 
Ready's Image establishing himself as a successful stallion. [Record No. 109, p. 24 (citations to the Complaint omitted)] "
629,23," The defendants argue that the plaintiffs have ""made no effort"" to show how New Jersey law ""would even be applicable other 
than to state that some of them live in New Jersey."" [Record No. 110, p. 11] They also contend that the choice of law of the 
agreements between the parties was that of Kentucky and that the Court has already determined that Kentucky law applies 
because of the controlling agreements and choice-of-law analysis. [Record No. 110, p. 11; Record No. 103, p. 3] The plaintiffs 
respond by asserting that the Complaint alleges that the Walmacs reached out to James Scatuorchio in New Jersey, the 
plaintiffs  [**67] reside in New Jersey, and that Walmac Farm markets itself in Kentucky. Because the Court has determined that 
the NJCFA is inapplicable to the facts as pleaded by the plaintiffs, it is unnecessary to address this argument. "
630,24," Additionally, the parties dispute whether the ""limitations period"" has expired. The defendants cite to Section 7.17, the two-year 
limitations provision, of the COA and argue that the COA was executed on October 24, 2008. The plaintiffs respond by arguing 
that the limitations period should be tolled under the ""continuing violation doctrine."" The case law the plaintiffs rely on, however, 
applies this equitable tolling doctrine to cases involving the ADEA, Title VII, and a case from the Ninth Circuit dealing with federal 
antitrust law. Regardless, this claim is over the SHCOA and its ""No Partnership"" provision, and the defendants do not proffer 
any argument of the applicability of the COA's two-year limitations provision to the SHCOA."

634,1, The factual recitation generally summarizes the FAC and other matters  [*2] which this Court may consider. 
644,1," The board members and employees are named only in their official capacities. Where the governmental entity is also named, 
this is redundant. Smith v. Metropolitan School Dist. Perry Township, 128 F.3d 1014, 1021, n.3 (7th Cir. 1997). The board

Board only. "
649,1," The factual recitation summarizes plaintiff's Complaint (""complaint""), the target of B of A's challenges. "
658,1," The Court refers to patent application number 433,606, which eventually issued as the '851 Patent, as the ""'851 Patent 
Application."" "
661,2," The Court presumes that the ""state antitrust laws"" to which Breville refers are contained in California's Cartwright Act, Cal. Bus. 
& Prof. Code § 16700 et seq. Since ""[t]he analysis under California's antitrust law mirrors the analysis under federal law,"" Cnty. 
of Tuolumne v. Sonora Cmty. Hosp., 236 F.3d 1148, 1160 (9th Cir. 2001), and since Noerr-Pennington immunity also applies to 
Cartwright Act claims, see Blank v. Kirwan, 39 Cal.3d 311, 325-26, 216 Cal. Rptr. 718, 703 P.2d 58 (1985), any Cartwright Act 
claims are insufficiently pled for the same reasons discussed herein. In any amended counterclaim, Storebound must cite the 
particular statutory or common law causes of action they are invoking, in order to ""give fair notice . . . to enable the opposing 
party to defend itself effectively."" Starr v. Baca, 652 F.3d 1202, 1216 (9th Cir. 2011) cert. denied, 132 S. Ct. 2101, 182 L. Ed. 2d 
882 (U.S. 2012). "
667,1," This matter has a complex procedural history involving several patent infringement claims as well as claims and counter claims 
relating to Microsoft's breach of contract claim. The court's February, 27, 2012, order provides a more complete procedural 
history of the case. (See generally 2/27/12 Order (Dkt. # 188).) "
668,2," As detailed below, the ITU developed the H.264 Standard jointly with two other SSOs—the International Organization for 
Standardization and the International Electrotechnical Commission. "
669,3," Regarding the scope of this litigation, Motorola elicited evidence at trial pertaining to the value of patents that Microsoft owns. 
The pleadings in this case, however, do not implicate the value of Microsoft's patents because there is no allegation that 
Microsoft breached its RAND obligations by failing to license its SEPs on reasonable terms. Indeed, the allegations in the 
pleadings pertain exclusively to the licensing practices of Motorola. (See generally Am. Compl. (Dkt. # 53); Motorola Answer 
(Dkt. # 68).) Insofar as Motorola seeks to insert the value of Microsoft's patents into the trial to determine the value of Motorola's 
patents, it is outside the scope of this action. Accordingly, as explained below, analysis relating to patents owned by Microsoft is 
relevant to this case not for their technological value, but for purposes of analogizing patent pools to find a reasonable rate for 
Motorola's 802.11 and H.264 SEP portfolios. "
670,4," Although the court has not labeled paragraphs specifically as Findings or Conclusions, such labels are not necessary. The 
nature  [*21] of the Findings and Conclusions to follow is apparent. See Tri-Tron Int'l. v. A.A. Velto, 525 F.2d 432, 435-36 (9th 
Cir. 1975) (""We look at a finding or a conclusion in its true light, regardless of the label that the district court may have placed on 
it. . . . [T]he findings are sufficient if they permit a clear understanding of the basis for the decision of the trial court, irrespective 
of their mere form or arrangement."") (citations omitted); In re Bubble Up Delaware, Inc., 684 F.2d 1259, 1262 (9th Cir. 1982) 
(""The fact that a court labels determinations 'Findings of Fact' does not make them so if they are in reality conclusions of law.""). "
671,5," For purposes of this order, an implementer is a person or entity who practices all or part of a standard. "
673,6," Although not all of Motorola's LOAs included precisely the quoted language, each LOA contained words to that effect. "
676,7," FRAND, which stands for fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory, has the same meaning as RAND. (See 11/16/12 Tr. at 53 
(Simcoe Testimony) (using FRAND and RAND interchangeably).) "
688,8," The court cannot ascertain at what point in the development of the H.264 Standard Dr. Luthra became involved. It appears Dr. 
Luthra's involvement began at the time of, or soon after, the creation of the JVT. (11/13/12 Tr. at 215 (Sullivan Testimony).) "
693,9," At trial, Dr. Drabik testified that interlaced coding tools could be invoked to decode progressive content  [*96] and that there 
may be advantages to doing so. (11/19/12 Tr. at 63-64 (Drabik Testimony).) Dr. Drabik, however, did not identify any 
circumstance where this actually occurred. Although the court does not disagree that interlaced coding tools could be used to 
decode progressive video content, from the trial record, doing so is at the very least highly uncommon and not advantageous. "
703,10," During the course of the trial, Motorola and Microsoft referenced additional Microsoft products to those listed in this order, 
such as the Surface tablet. Neither party, however, presented any evidence as to the overall functionality of these other products 
which would be necessary for the court to analyze the importance of Motorola's SEPs to the product. Accordingly, the court 
declines to provide an analysis or a royalty rate for products for which insufficient evidence was presented. "
708,11," In its proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, Microsoft asserted that over 100 companies have identified 
 [*150] patents in LOAs as essential to the 802.11 Standard. In support of this assertion, Microsoft cites to portions of Dr. 
Gibson's testimony and Exhibits 7 and 1592. (Microsoft Pr. FC (Dkt. # 621) ¶ 238.) Indeed, Dr. Gibson testified that Exhibits 7 
and 1592 support a finding that over 100 companies have identified patents essential to 802.11 Standard, but those exhibits 
demonstrate no such thing. (See Exs. 7, 1592.) Instead, Exhibit 1592 lists 59 companies that have submitted blanket LOAs to 
the IEEE. Because the number of companies contributing technology to the 802.11 Standard is relevant to the court's analysis 
for determining a royalty rate, the court attempted to discern how and in what portions of the record Microsoft and Dr. Gibson 
came up with their claim that over 100 companies have identified essential patents. The court concluded that no such evidence 
exists in the record. In fact, Microsoft experts Dr. Murphy and Dr. Lynde both asserted that somewhere between 90 and 93 
companies had submitted LOAs. (11/16/12 Tr. at 109 (Lynde Testimony); 11/13/12 Tr. at 175 (Murphy Testimony) (Q: ""And I 
believe in one of your demonstratives you indicated there were around 90 SEP holders of  [*151] 802.11 patents?"" A: ""I don't 
remember the precise number, I think it was 93."").) Additionally, it is important to note that patents of course expire over time, meaning that at any one time there are less than 350 
patents identified as essential to the 802.11 Standard. Although Dr. Gibson's testimony on this point is ambiguous (see 11/15/12 
Tr. at 99 (Gibson Testimony)), as explained in the section analyzing the Via Licensing 802.11 patent pool, there are currently 
approximately 250 patents identified as essential to the 802.11 Standard. (See infra ¶¶ 567-68.)"
708,12," Here, Dr. Gibson, a Microsoft expert, testified that 94 companies had submitted blanket LOAs and directed the court to Exhibit 
1592 in support of that assertion. (11/15/12 Tr. at 99-100 (Gibson Testimony).) Exhibit 1592, however, lists only 59 companies 
that have submitted such blanket LOAs. (Ex. 1592.) Likewise, Exhibit 1159 lists 59 companies that have submitted blanket 
LOAs. (Ex. 1159.) Further, Dr. Lynde, also a Microsoft expert, testified that 59 companies had submitted blanket LOAs. 
(11/16/12 Tr. at 109 (Lynde Testimony) (""So there are 59 [entities] that have these blanket disclosures that I was able to 
identify."").) Despite  [*152] significant time searching, the court cannot find support for Dr. Gibson's higher number and therefore 
disregards his testimony on this matter. "
709,13," Motorola's  [*154] expert did not review any patent file histories before concluding that Motorola's patents were essential to the 
802.11 Standard, and he did not articulate a construction for any term, but instead assumed that every term of every analyzed 
patent required only its plain and ordinary meaning, a meaning which he did not articulate. (11/19/12 Tr. at 109 (Williams 
Testimony).) Using this approach, Motorola's expert determined that two patents, not subject to this litigation—U.S. Patent Nos. 
5,319,712 and 5,636,223 —were essential to the standard, yet those two patents were judicially determined to be non-essential 
based on claim construction. (Id. at 107-09.) Nevertheless, Microsoft's experts did not dispute that Motorola's 11 SEPs are 
essential to the 802.11 Standard. Instead, Microsoft's experts assumed for purposes of their analyses that all of Motorola's 
declared essential patents were indeed essential to the 802.11 Standard pursuant to the IEEE's definition of ""essential."" (See 
Ex. 5 at 14, § 6.1.) "
712,14," As for each of Motorola's 802.11 ""essential"" patents, Motorola's expert did not assess the contributions of companies other 
than Microsoft or Motorola to the 802.11 Standard, nor did he evaluate the patents of any company other than Motorola and 
Microsoft with respect to the 802.11 Standard. (11/19/12 Tr. at 116-17 (Williams Testimony).) Motorola's expert also did not 
determine the relative importance of Motorola's patents as compared to any third-party patents (including patents in the Via 
Licensing 802.11 patent pool). (Id. at 117-120.)"
712,15," Lending support for the court's conclusion is the fact that other  [*164] companies have disclosed patents essential to the 
802.11 Standard in the area of channel access. Apple Computer identified two U.S. patents related to channel access as 
essential to the 802.11 Standard: U.S. Patent Nos. 4,689,786 (using a three-step handshake method wherein periods before 
attempted retransmissions are dynamically adjusted based on recent traffic history) and 4,661,902 (handshake method and the 
retransmission timing after an assumed collision). (11/15/12 Tr. at 150 (Gibson Testimony); Exs. 89, 88.) Proxim, Inc., identified 
at least one patent, U.S. Patent No. 5,231,634, as essential to the 802.11 Standard relating to a collision avoidance scheme 
when there are multiple agents in the wireless system. (11/15/12 Tr. at 150-51 (Gibson Testimony); Ex. 129.) Agere Systems, 
Inc., identified at least one patent and one application that matured into a patent as essential to the 802.11 Standard relating to 
collision avoidance: U.S. Patent No. 5,422,887 (providing equitable access using a CDMA-CD scheme) and Application 
10/092,295, which became U.S. Patent No. 6,707,867 (transmitting signals with timing information related to transmission 
delays). (11/15/12 Tr. at 150-51 (Gibson  [*165] Testimony); Exs. 137, 325.) Spectrix has identified at least one patent as related 
to channel access: U.S. Patent No. 7,643,509 (multiple access/collision avoidance protocol). (11/15/12 Tr. at 150-51 (Gibson 
Testimony); Ex. 485.) Nokia Corp. sent an LOA to the 802.11 Working Group disclosing U.S. Patent No. 7,006,472 as essential 
to the standard, relating to QoS and selecting the appropriate radio flow for each packet from a selection of predefined flows. 
(11/15/12 Tr. at 150-51 (Gibson Testimony); Ex. 391.) ETRI identified a U.S. patent related to channel access: 7,616,612 
(method of guaranteeing QoS for VoIP using priority information). (11/15/12 Tr. at 150-51 (Gibson Testimony); Ex. 484.) And, LG 
identified at least three patents as related to channel access or QoS: 6,469,993 (preparing a table of dynamic priority numbers 
and each terminal); 7,616,592 (communication between a mobile station and a base station having header information); and 
7,653,025 (scheduling packet transmission based on a service identification related to the packet). (11/15/12 Tr. at 150-51 
(Gibson Testimony); Exs. 476, 483, 486.) "
714,16," Lending support for the court's conclusion is the fact that other companies have disclosed declared patents essential to the 
802.11 Standard in the area of data modulation. Spectrix Corp. identified U.S. Patent No. 5,247,380 as essential  [*172] to the 
802.11 Standard and related to spread spectrum technology (describing an infrared two-way communication system). (11/15/12 
Tr. at 151-52 (Gibson Testimony); Ex. 264.) Nokia Corporation disclosed two applications and two patents related to spread 
spectrum technology in the 802.11 Standard: (1) Application No. 20020160769, which became U.S. Patent Nos. 6,675,012 
(dynamic frequency selection that indicates transmission frequency and level of interference) and 6,298,035 (estimating 
separate channel frequencies when using OFDM with two transmitters); and (2) Application No. 20030050012, which became 
U.S. Patent Nos. 6,738,599 (dynamic frequency selection in an ad-hoc network) and 6,834,045 (a method for allocating 
frequencies in a WLAN operating in the 5 GHz range). (11/15/12 Tr. at 151-52 (Gibson Testimony); Exs. 321,255, 327, 357.) 
Cisco Systems, Inc., also made contributions in the area of data modulation: U.S. Patent No. 6,654,921 (receipt of signals from 
multiple transmission management schemes, time-division multiplexing and frequency division multiplexing). (11/15/12 Tr. at 
151-52 (Gibson Testimony); Ex. 318.) AT&T also identified one patent related to data modulation: U.S. Patent No. 6,430,231 
 [*173] (method for using two or more antennas to receive one more symbol than other antennas by using time-division 
multiplexing in an orthogonal manner). (11/15/12 Tr. at 151-52 (Gibson Testimony); Ex. 260.) Certain patents in the Via license 
pool also relate to data modulation, including U.S. Patent Nos. 5,307,376 (providing higher quality transmission of a digital signal 
interlaced in time and infrequency), 6,925,587 (creating an Interleaver design such that the same design is near-optimal for all 
Interleavers within a set of sizes), and 7,526,687 (creating an Interleaver design such that the same design is near-optimal for all 
Interleavers within a set of sizes). (11/15/12 Tr. at 151-152 (Gibson Testimony); Exs. 131,478, 481.) "
716,17," As seen with data modulation relevant to 802.11g, 802.11g, and 802.11n, lending support for the court's conclusion is the fact 
that other companies have disclosed patents essential to the 802.11 Standard in the area of data modulation. (See supra note 
16.) "
718,18," Lending support for the court's conclusion is the fact that other companies have disclosed patents essential to the 802.11 
Standard in the area of security. Nokia disclosed three  [*187] U.S. patents to the 802.11 Working Group related to encryption of 
data in communications: U.S. Patent Nos. 5,987,137; 6,118,775; and 7,120,422. (11/15/12 Tr. at 148-49 (Gibson Testimony); 
Exs. 234, 245, 397.) LG disclosed two U.S. patents related to encryption of data in communications: U.S. Patent Nos. 6,839,553 
(general authentication process between a network and a mobile station) and 6,347,144 (preventing copying of data streams by 
placing encryption information inside a header of that stream). (11/15/12 Tr. at 148-49 (Gibson Testimony); Exs. 477, 475.) 
Finally, ETRI disclosed one U.S. patent related to encryption of data in communications: U.S. Patent No. 7,477,746 (dynamically 
managing a group transient key). (11/15/12 Tr. at 148-49 (Gibson Testimony); Ex. 480.) "
722,19," The RIM license agreement also involves patent transfers going both ways, providing mutual benefit to both parties. (11/20/12 
Tr. at 56:20-57:8, 105:7-106:11 (Dailey Testimony).) "
726,20," Microsoft itself preferred and chose to engage in bilateral negotiations for the 802.11 Standard rather than joining a pool. 
(11/16/12 Tr. at 155:2-15 (Lynde Testimony).) "
731,21," The trial record supporting the court's policy concern  [*236] is clear: Other things remaining the same, the higher the value of 
an owner's SEPs and the stronger its licensing program, the lower is its incentive to join a patent pool and the less likely it is to 
join a pool. (11/13/12 Tr. at 134:3-6 (Glanz Testimony); see also 11/16/12 Tr. at 145:11-13, 146:16-20, 148:9-20 (Lynde 
Testimony); Ex. 1036 at 295; 11/19/12 Tr. at 146:17-147:3 (Schmalensee Testimony); Ex. 2945 at 174 (""[F]irms with higher 
value patent portfolios are less likely to join a proportional pool."").) "
734,22," The court notes, however, that Dr. Lynde's royalty rate calculations are based on the $13 million cap in royalties provided 
under the MPEG LA H.264 patent pool royalty share agreement. (Ex. 1161.) Based on Microsoft's current sales volume, 
Microsoft's royalty payments into the MPEG LA H.264 patent pool meet the $13 million threshold and are therefore capped. 
Using $13 million as Microsoft's total royalty payments, Dr. Lynde calculates Motorola's share of those royalties based the pro 
rata share of Motorola's 63 H.264 SEPs. (Ex. 1161.) Having determined that the MPEG LA H.264 patent pool, including the $13 
million royalty cap, is indicative of a RAND royalty rate, the court finds little problem in basing a RAND royalty on a capped 
royalty payment. Indeed, Motorola's licensing expert, Mr. Donohoe, suggests caps on the total lump sum royalty payments. 
(11/20/12 Tr. at 145:6-146:15 (Donohoe Testimony).) "
735,23," This equation represents a dramatic simplification of the calculation actually performed by the court. To be rigorous and 
transparent with the parties, the court will now explain in detail its process for calculating the RAND rate. In essence, the court 
compares the total value of joining a patent pool to the total value of abstaining from a patent pool and then performs simple 
algebra to calculate the RAND rate. The value to a company of joining a patent pool, which the court labels ""VP,"" can be approximated by adding together the 
 [*249] value of all benefits of joining the pool and subtracting all costs. This means that to calculate the value of joining a pool, 
the court adds (1) the amount the company receives in royalties from the pool for use of its own patents by others (""P+""); to (2) 
the value to the company of having the intellectual property rights to the pool patents (""IP"") (see supra ¶ 523); and (3) any 
external value the company derives from adding its patents to the pool, such as promoting participation in the pool and thereby 
encouraging widespread adoption of the standard (""E"") (see supra ¶ 485, 503-04); and subtracting (4) the amount the company 
pays into the pool to use patents (""P-""); and (5) the opportunity cost of using the patents in a different way, such as abstaining 
from the patent pool and licensing patents outside the pool (""OC""). In algebra terms, this can be expressed as VP = P+ + IP + E - 
P- - OC. By similar methods, the court can calculate the value to a company of abstaining from a patent pool, which the court 
labels ""VA,"" by adding (1) the amount the company would receive for its patents outside the pool given the RAND commitment 
(notice that this is, by definition, the RAND rate) (""A+"");  [*250] to (2) the value to the company of having the intellectual property 
rights to the pool patents (""IP""), which the court assumes a company wishing to practice the standard would obtain by some 
method; and subtracting (3) the amount the company would have to pay to obtain licenses to the pool patents without joining the 
pool (""A-"") and (4) the opportunity cost of not joining the pool. In algebra terms, this can be expressed as VA = A++ IP - A- - OC. The next step in this calculation is to compare the value of joining a patent pool (VP) to the value of abstaining from a patent 
pool (VA). To begin, both VP and VA include both ""IP"" and ""OC."" The value IP will be equivalent both in the pool and outside the 
pool because a company practicing the standard will acquire the same patent licensing rights whether it is inside or outside of 
the pool because it will presumably obtain rights to all of the patents necessary to practice the standard. Thus, the variable IP 
will have the same value irrespective of pool membership and will not be affected by patent strength relative to the pool. This 
simplifies the comparison somewhat. Algebraically, the IP values on either side of the comparison will ""cancel  [*251] each other 
out,"" resulting in the variable vanishing from the comparison altogether. The situation is not quite as simple with regard to OC, as 
will be explained below, so OC will not always ""cancel out"" in quite the same way and must remain in the comparison. The nature of the comparison between VP and VA varies depending on the value of the company's patents (measured by how 
important the patents are to the standard and how important they are to actual products the company knows about). For 
example, a company with very valuable patents relative to the pool or patents that are critical to the standard might be able to 
command higher royalties by abstaining from the pool (and hence could profit by abstaining). (See supra note 21.) On the other 
hand, a company with patents that are weak relative to the pool or that are unimportant to the standard might have the opposite 
problem (and hence could profit by joining the pool). (See id.) If a court can determine conclusively that, for a given company, 
joining a patent pool would be substantially more or less valuable than abstaining from it, the court should assign a coefficient to "
736,," the comparison to reflect that fact, e.g., Cx(P+ - P- - OC)  [*252] + E = A+ - A- - OC. Note that the coefficient C does not multiply 
E because the external value represented by E does not vary based on the value of the company's patents or their importance 
to the standard—assuming as the court does here that all patents in the pool return the same royalty rate. (See supra ¶¶ 465-66, 
500.) Note also that the equation only applies the comparison coefficient to OC on one side of the equation, thus accounting for 
the fact that the opportunity cost of joining the pool or abstaining from it will vary proportionately with the relative value of the 
patents, their importance to the standard, and how important those patents are to actual products the company knows about. As 
a simple example of how to calculate the comparison coefficient C, if a court determined from the evidence before it that a 
company could do twice as well monetarily by abstaining from a patent pool than by joining it, the equation would be 2x(P+ - P- - 
OC) + E = A+ - A- - OC. In this case, the court has no evidence demonstrating that Motorola's patents are any more valuable than the average patent in 
the MPEG LA H.264 pool (see infra ¶¶ 528-36) and so assumes that the comparison coefficient  [*253] C is equal to 1, i.e., that 
VP = VA. This amounts to assuming that, for Motorola, joining the MPEG LA H.264 patent pool and abstaining from it are 
roughly equivalent transactions from a monetary perspective. (See id.) The court is therefore left with the following equation: P+- 
P- - OC + E = A+ - A- - OC. The OC values are equivalent on both sides when C = 1 since joining the patent pool is monetarily 
equivalent to not joining it, so the OC values ""cancel out"" algebraically, leaving the court with an equation of: P+ - P- + E = A+ - A-
. Some of these ""variables"" are actually known quantities. The pool rates, P+ and P-, are known (see supra ¶¶ 522, 525-26), and 
will be known in most cases like this (otherwise there would be no comparison to make in the first place). On the other hand, A+ 
is not known. This makes sense because A+ is, by definition, the RAND rate—the amount a company would receive for licenses 
to its patents if it abstained from the pool but adhered to the RAND commitment. As for E, the court has heard testimony that 
Microsoft derived external value from joining the patent pool because it had a vested interest in widespread adoption of the 
standard. (Supra ¶¶ 503-05.) Specifically,  [*254] as detailed above, the court heard testimony that Microsoft pays twice as much 
into the MPEG LA H.264 patent pool as it receives back in royalties. (Id.) The court has inferred from this evidence that E = P+. 
In other words, the external value of joining the pool is equivalent to the royalty deficit Microsoft incurs through pool membership. 
As for A-, the court has heard no testimony whatsoever about how much a company like Motorola would have to pay for the 
pool's H.264 SEP collection if it abstained from the pool. Faced with this lack of evidence, the court infers that the rate Motorola 
would have to pay would be higher than the pool rate, but not twice as high because some, if not all, of the companies holding 
SEPs would be subject to the RAND commitment. Accordingly, the court weighs the evidence before it and finds that the rate 
outside the pool would be 1.5 times the pool rate. Algebraically, this can be expressed as A- = 1.5xP-. It remains only to substitute all of these values into the operable equation and solve algebraically for the RAND rate, A+. 
Substituting the known and inferred values into the operable equation yields: P+ - P- + P+ = A+- 1.5xP-. Simplifying and solving 
 [*255] for A+ yields: A+ = 2xP+ + .5xP-. The evidence before the court demonstrates that 2xP+ = P-. This is because Microsoft 
pays twice as much into the MPEG LA H.264 patent pool as it receives back in royalties (supra ¶ 504), and the court has already 
assumed that this equation would also hold true for Motorola since Microsoft is a comparable player in the technology industry to 
Motorola's parent company Google. (Supra ¶ 525.) This allows for further simplification: A+ = 2xP+ + .5x2xP+ = 3xP+. This results in precisely the formula the court used to calculate 
its RAND rate for Motorola's H.264 SEPs. Translating this back to English, the RAND rate in this case is three times the pool 
rate, or the pool rate plus twice the pool rate. "
737,24," Motorola contends that Microsoft products other than Windows and the Xbox use the H.264 Standard. Motorola lists at least 
the Windows Phone 7 and 7.5, Windows Embedded, Silverlight, the Zune, Lync, and Skype, as Microsoft products that use the 
H.264 Standard. (Motorola Pr. FC ¶ 535.) Motorola, however, did not provide sufficient evidence for the court to ascertain the 
functionality of these products, making it impossible for the court to determine the importance of Motorola's H.264 SEPs to these 
products. Indeed, the little trial evidence regarding functionality of these additional products demonstrates that Motorola's SEPs 
would have little value to them. (See 11/14/12 Tr. at 150 (Orchard Testimony).) Without such evidence, the court is left to 
conclude that the low bound of RAND is the appropriate royalty rate for all Microsoft products—Windows, the Xbox, and all 
others. "
744,25," The court is aware that the 1% royalty rate paid by Marvell constitutes the entirety of the royalty rates paid by Marvell for its 
802.11 Wi-Fi chip. Motorola, on the other hand, only owns a portion of the intellectual property comprising the 802.11 Standard. 
Here, the court notes that it is not privy to financial and licensing considerations,  [*284] beyond the 1% royalty to ARM, of 
Marvell and other third-party 802.11 SEP owners. The minimal evidence before the court suggests that other considerations 
exist that justify the court in employing the 1% rate as a comparable. Marvell owns significant patents relevant to the 802.11 
Standard, and Marvell and Motorola have engaged in cross licensing discussions. (11/14/12 Tr. at 64-68 (Ochs Testimony); Exs. 
16, 1608.) Without a full understanding of the considerations of Marvell and other third-party 802.11 SEP owners, the court is left 
to consider the 1% ARM royalty, equating to 3-4 cents per chip, only as an indicator of a reasonable royalty rate in the 
semiconductor intellectual property licensing industry. "
746,26," Although the court generally agrees that different SEP portfolios typically lead to different RAND royalty rates vis-a-vis the 
same implementer, that logic is case specific and does not apply here. "
748,27," Although Motorola may contend that Microsoft products other than the Xbox use the 802.11 Standard, Motorola did not make 
such an assertion at trial. Thus, the court is unable to ascertain the functionality of any other Microsoft products that Motorola 
may contend use the 802.11 Standard, making it impossible for the court to determine the importance of Motorola's 802.11 
SEPs to these products. Accordingly, the court is left to conclude that the RAND rate for Motorola's 802.11 SEP portfolio applies 
only to Microsoft's Xbox products. "
749,28," As stated, Motorola did not assert at trial that any Microsoft products other the Xbox used Motorola's 802.11 SEP portfolio. 
The court therefore could not apply the determined RAND royalty rate to any other Microsoft products. As a result, the court 
applies the low bound of the RAND range to all Microsoft products, other than the Xbox, using the 802.11 Standard. "

""not opine on the existence of a conspiracy."" Id. The expert in Fleischman is easily distinguished from Professor Priest, and the 
reasoning of that court is thus unavailing to the Plaintiffs. "
759,9," In addition to their more particular objections, the Defendants challenge Dr. Hamilton's ability to give any expert testimony in 
this case, because he supposedly lacks expertise in ""cartel detection."" See Defs.' Reply 10. This argument is easily dispatched, 
considering that Dr. Hamilton has nearly two decades of experience teaching the economic principles of antitrust and has 
previously been accepted as an expert in antitrust cases. See Hamilton Dep. 333-34. Dr. Hamilton does not rely on generalized 
skill in the area; rather, he uses his advanced economics degree and accumulated knowledge of antitrust to opine on this matter."

836,11, Docket No. 24.
836,12, Docket No. 26. 
838,1," DFA's Complaint defines ""beauty products"" as fragrances and cosmetics (i.e., make up and skin care). (DE 1 at 2.)"
838,2," These facts are derived from the well-pled factual allegations in the Complaint, which must be taken as true and construed in 
the light most favorable to DFA. See World Holdings, LLC v. Federal Republic of Germany, 701 F.3d 641, 649 (11th Cir. 2012). "
839,3," Since this is a suggested retail price, the reasonable inference is that the letter is informing the duty-free operators of the price 
at which ELC suggests the products should be sold to consumers. If the letter instead referred to the prices ELC would charge 
DFA, then it would not be a labeled a suggestion. Moreover, the letter uses different wording than the Complaint in describing 
this announcement. The Complaint consistently describes the prices that duty free stores pay manufacturers like ELC as travel 
retail wholesale pricing. (See DE 1 at 2-3, 6.) "
841,4," Altogether, DFA alleges four conspiracy theories: (1) to exclude DFA from the market of bidding on duty-free concessions at 
U.S. airports; (2) to exclude DFA from the market of selling beauty products in U.S. airport duty-free stores; (3) to raise the 
prices of beauty products sold in U.S. airport duty-free stores; and (4) to monopolize the market for beauty products sold in U.S. 
airport duty-free stores."
841,5," Both claims require additional elements as well. For instance, to state a claim for conspiracy to restrain trade under § 1, a 
plaintiff must allege facts plausibly suggesting ""(1) an agreement to enter a conspiracy, (2) designed to achieve an unlawful 
objective."" Aquatherm Industries, Inc. v. Florida Power & Light Co., 145 F.3d 1258, 1262 (11th Cir. 1998). To state a claim for 
conspiracy to monopolize under § 2, a plaintiff must allege facts plausibly suggesting ""(1) concerted action deliberately entered 
into with the specific intent of achieving a monopoly; and (2) the commission  [**15] of at least one overt act in furtherance of the 
conspiracy."" Todorov, 921 F.2d at 1460, n.35. "
842,6," DFA argues in its brief that this allegation means that the ""Newark airport bid process was sealed from the public, and thus no 
one except bidders knew about it."" (DE 25 at 5 (citing DE 1 at 8).) But the allegation does not support that interpretation. Just 
because the identities of the bidders had not yet been revealed does not mean that no one knew about the process except the 
bidders. DFA's interpretation of its complaint during the hearing was more reasonable: DFA responded to the Court's questions 
by admitting that it was not a secret that the Newark airport was accepting bids on its duty-free concessions. (DE 114 at 26.) 
DFA further admitted that people in the cosmetic industry and the duty-free retail business—a description that encompasses 
ELC—would presumably know about the bid process. (Id.)"
842,7," DFA alleged that only the Newark and Atlanta RFPs were ""sealed,"" meaning that the identities of bidders were not known. (See 
DE 1 at 8, 12.) But DFA does not allege that no one besides the bidders knew that the Newark and Atlanta airports  [**19] were 
accepting bids on their duty-free concessions. While the Court accepts as true the factual allegation that ELC's letter was 
unsolicited, the further allegation that the letter was improper is a legal conclusion the Court need not credit. DFA has not 
alleged that rules prohibited other entities from contacting the decisionmakers to inform them who they thought would be good 
duty-free operators. Moreover, since DFA has alleged that there are fewer than 10 major duty-free operators (id. at 14), and 
since ELC's letter shows that it had a relationship with 10 duty-free operators in December 2008, it would have been reasonable 
for ELC to assume that at least one of the duty-free operators bidding during these RFPs was authorized to sell its products, 
which in turn would make it in ELC's interest to submit a letter identifying all the operators it had a relationship with to increase 
the chance the winning bid would sell ELC products. "
843,8," For example, following AirTran's initial invitation to Delta to collude, Delta  [**24] indicated during a public earnings call that it 
had no plans to implement a first-bag fee. Thirteen days later, during AirTran's public earnings call (which it knew Delta "
844,," monitored), AirTran stated that it was considering the viability of implementing first-bag fees. Roughly two and a half months 
later, Delta indicated during another public earnings call (which it knew AirTran monitored) that it was willing to impose first-bag 
fees. Eight days later, AirTran remarked during its public earnings call that it wanted to implement first-bag fees and had 
invested in the capability to do so, but that it had not yet implemented the fee because Delta had not done so. Less than two 
weeks later, Delta announced that it was implementing a $15 first-bag fee, effective December 5, 2008. One week later, AirTran 
announced that it was implementing the exact same fee on the exact same day. See In re Delta, 733 F. Supp. 2d at 1352-56. "
845,9," Note that despite these alleged communications, DFA was still awarded Atlanta's duty-free concessions."
845,10," To the extent DFA argues that it has shown that something ""more"" by alleging that ELC and DFA's competitors had the 
opportunity to conspire because ELC maintains partnerships with DFASS (one of DFA's competitors) and Heinemann Group 
(which operates another of DFA's competitors, Travel Retail), ""the mere opportunity to conspire . . . does not, standing alone, 
permit the inference of conspiracy."" Williamson Oil Co., Inc. v. Phillip Morris, 346 F.3d 1287, 1319 (11th Cir. 2003) (citation 
omitted). Nor does it suffice when coupled with allegations of parallel business behavior. See Twombly, 550 U.S. at 567, n.12. "
846,11," ""A market share at or less than 50% is inadequate as a matter of law to constitute monopoly power."" Bailey v. Allgas, Inc., 284 
F.3d 1237, 1250 (11th Cir. 2002). DFA alleges that ELC's market share in the relevant market is ""approximately 50% or greater."" 
(DE 1 at 29.)"
846,12," The Complaint makes it clear that ELC had stopped directly selling products to Stellar before Stellar and DFA partnered for the 
Orlando RFP. (DE 1 at 10.) So ELC's later pronouncement that it would refuse to sell its products to Stellar did not constitute a 
change in its current relationship with Stellar. (DE 1 at 11.) "
847,13," DFA's reliance on Redbox Automated Retail LLC v. Universal City Studios, LLLP, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 72700, 2009 WL 
2588748 (D. Del. Aug. 17, 2009), is misplaced. Redbox denied a motion to dismiss an antitrust claim because Redbox alleged 
that the Universal persuaded others to boycott Redbox by not distributing Universal DVDs to it. 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 72700, 
[WL] at *5. Taking action to bring about a boycott is a far cry from ELC sending letters containing truthful statements that 
promote ELC's business partners. DFA never alleges that any airport boycotted it; rather, DFA simply alleges that some airports 
decided to award duty-free concessions to other businesses after ELC communicated truthful information to the airports."
847,14," In its Complaint, DFA alleges that the fact that other duty-free operators went along with ELC's pronouncements regarding 
retail prices and display requirements shows an illegal conspiracy between ELC and these operators. (DE 1 at 19.) But DFA 
alleged in its Complaint that while it had an ongoing relationship with ELC it too went along with these pronouncements 
regarding price and display requirements. (Id. at 7.) And at oral argument, DFA admitted that going along with these 
pronouncements was not evidence that it was involved in an illegal conspiracy. (DE 114 at 33-37.) That other operators now are 
going along with similar pronouncements is thus also not such evidence. (Id. at 36-37.) "
848,15," DFA's remaining allegations of anticompetitive conduct merit little attention. Though DFA alleges that ELC has purchased 
competing brands that had been sold at duty-free stores by only DFA, like Smashbox, DFA alleges that ELC did this to diminish 
competition in the beauty-product manufacturing market, which is neither a market it defines nor a relevant market for purposes 
of DFA's attempted-monopolization claim. (See DE 1 at 28.) Since the Court has rejected DFA's allegations of conspiracy, they 
cannot form the basis of anticompetitive conduct. The same result holds for DFA's allegations that anticompetitive conduct is 
demonstrated by ELC's tortious activity because the Court rejects the only tort claim DFA alleges below. "
850,16," DFA alleges that ""there are fewer than ten major duty free store operators in the United States."" (DE 1 at 14.) DFA alleges that 
during each bidding process, its competitors made ELC aware that DFA bid on the duty-free concessions. (DE 1 at 8-11.) A 
reasonable inference from this allegation is that more than one competitor carrying ELC products bid on this concession. With 
respect to the Boston airport, DFA alleges the identity of the competing bidders, and ELC's letter attached to DFA's complaint 
shows that these bidders do carry ELC products. (Id. at 9; DE 1-2 at 2.) And the Complaint strongly implies that the two named 
competing bidders for the Orlando  [**50] airport carried ELC's products. (See DE 1 at 11.) "
860,1, It appears that Plaintiff would not object to this. (See Doc. 154 at 1 n.1.) 
861,2," Defendant argues that a breach of a contract cannot form the basis of Plaintiff's UCL claim. That is not true. ""[A] breach of 
contract may . . . form the predicate for [a UCL claim], provided that it also constitutes conduct that is unlawful, or unfair, or 
fraudulent."" Puentes v. Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, Inc., 160 Cal. App. 4th 638, 645, 72 Cal. Rptr. 3d 903 (Ct. App. 2008) 
 [*10] (emphasis in original) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). See also Cabo Brands, Inc. v. MAS Bevs., Inc., 
Case No. 8:11-cv-1911-ODW(ANx), 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 78017, at *11-13 (C.D. Cal. June 5, 2012) (the allegation that the 
defendant enjoyed the benefits of a contract ""without carrying out its part of the contract"" supported a claim for unfair competition 
under the ""unfair"" prong). Again, whether the breach of contract at issue here is unfair depends on factual matters that the Court 
cannot resolve at this juncture."
861,3," Plaintiff suggests that its UCL claim may also be supported by ""unlawful"" or ""fraudulent"" conduct. (Doc. 109 at 8-9.) The Court 
is not persuaded. Plaintiff specifically alleged its cause of action under the ""unfair"" prong of the UCL. (Doc. 23 ¶ 37.) "

standing on LT Connect."
885,119," Cf. Airlines Reporting Corp. v. S & N Travel, Inc., 58 F.3d 857, 862-63 (2d Cir. 1995) (stating that a parent company cannot 
attempt to create federal diversity jurisdiction by assigning its claim to one of its subsidiaries). "
888,1," On September 17, 2012, First Continental, with which Scullark is associated, executed a quitclaim deed purporting to convey 
its interest in the Real Property to Scullark."
888,2," The complaint is obviously an incorporation of various form complaints used by other pro se plaintiffs in this district in similar 
lawsuits. The complaint refers to the laws of other states, (see, e.g., ¶ 93), and contains incorrect subject-verb agreement 
throughout as though a singular ""plaintiff""  [*8] was merely replaced with ""plaintiffs"" without further alteration (see, e.g., ¶¶ 20—
21, 62). Indeed, paragraphs 23 through 96 of Scullark's complaint in this case are nearly identical to the complaint that was filed 
in Nooh v. Recontruct Co., No. 11-2506-STA-dkv (W.D. Tenn. June 20, 2011), ECF No. 1 (dismissed Mar. 29, 2012). "
891,3," Service of process cannot be made on unnamed or fictitious parties. The filing of a complaint against ""John Doe"" defendants 
does not toll the running of the statute of limitations against those parties. See Cox v. Treadway, 75 F.3d 230, 240 (6th Cir. 
1996); Bufalino v. Mich. Bell Tel. Co., 404 F.2d 1023, 1028 (6th Cir. 1968). Accordingly, it is recommended that the complaint be 
dismissed against the John Doe defendants."
891,4," The weight of authority supports dismissal for failure to state a claim when a case is barred by the doctrine of res judicata. See 
Thompson v. U.S., Small Bus. Admin., 8 Fed. Appx. 547, 549 (6th Cir. 2001)(affirming failure-to-state-a-claim dismissal that was 
based on res judicata); Johnson v. Johnson, 940 F.2d 660 (6th Cir. 1991) )(unpublished table decision)(same); Link v. 
Sumner Cnty. Jail, 3:10-CV-0236, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26371, 2010 WL 1138029, at *2 (M.D. Tenn. Mar. 19, 2010)(""Because 
the plaintiff's  [*16] claims are barred by the doctrine of res judicata, the Court finds that the plaintiff's complaint fails to state a 
claim upon which relief can be granted.""). Also, the issue of res judicata need not be raised in a motion in order for the court to address it, and it can be cause for dismissal 
based on failure to state a claim pursuant to initial screening under 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e). See Murray v. Reed, 69 Fed. App'x 
246, 247 (6th Cir. 2003)(affirming district court's dismissal of complaint upon initial screening based on frivolousness and failure 
to state a claim under the principle of res judicata); Skudnov v. Hous. Auth. of Bowling Green, 1:07CV-149-R, 2007 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 74819, 2007 WL 2915179, at *3 (W.D. Ky. Oct. 5, 2007)(""In the present action, Plaintiff is simply trying to re-litigate claims 
that he lost as part of his 2005 action. As such, this action is barred by the doctrine of res judicata, and therefore, must be 
dismissed as legally frivolous and for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.""); cf. Holloway Const. Co. v. U.S. 
Dep't of Labor, 891 F.2d 1211, 1212 (6th Cir. 1989)(stating that a district court is ""empowered to raise res judicata sua sponte"" 
and ""may invoke the doctrine  [*17] of res judicata in the interests of, inter alia, the promotion of judicial economy"")."
891,5," In addition, according to the factual allegations in the complaint, Pipes has no interest any longer in the Real Property. 
Therefore, in addition to the grounds set forth herein, the complaint fails to state a claim by Pipes upon which relief can be 
granted, and it is recommended that Pipes's complaint be dismissed on this basis as well. "
905,1, The Court has not certified the putative classes in this case yet. Class certification litigation has just recently begun.
905,2," In addition to the three proposed Plaintiffs' classes, three additional Plaintiffs' groups are involved in the case but have 
indicated that if a class that includes them is certified they will opt out of that class. Treating this as a preemptive opt-out, the 
Court has not included them in any of the litigation regarding the putative classes, and the instant memorandum and order will 
not apply to these groups. The Direct Purchaser Individual Plaintiffs are the Walgreen Plaintiffs (Case No. 1:12-cv-203) and the Rite Aid Plaintiffs (Case 
No. 1:13-cv-5). The End Payor  [*11] Individual Plaintiffs are the Blue Cross Blue Shield Plaintiffs (2:12-cv-464). "
908,3," The Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations list, also known as the ""Orange Book,"" is a source 
where the FDA publishes both the names of drugs that have been approved and their related patents. AstraZeneca LP v. 
Apotex, Inc., 633 F.3d 1042, 1045 (Fed. Cir. 2010). "
909,4," That following month, CorePharma petitioned the FDA to waive the paragraph IV certification requirement so it could file a 
section viii certification instead. "
910,5, King had recently received approval for an 800 mg product.
910,6," At the time, Dr. Spireas was also serving as president of SigmaPharm, a company that developed pharmaceutical products and 
technology. "
911,7," As an aside, Plaintiffs note Mutual filed another citizen petition on May 13, 2009; Plaintiffs contend this petition was baseless 
(DPP Compl. ¶¶ 230-33; IPP Compl. ¶¶ 228-31; EPP Compl. ¶¶ 224-27). "
912,8," In addition to the federal joint conduct claims, Defendants also seek to dismiss Counts III and IV of the End Payor Plaintiffs' 
complaint, which allege nearly identical antitrust violations under state law for the restraint of trade and conspiracy to 
monopolize.  [*38] Plaintiffs concede, and Defendants do not dispute, that the state antitrust laws at issue follow federal law 
(Court File No. 102 at 54 n.101). Therefore, the Court's decision on the federal claims will apply equally to the End Payor 
Plaintiffs' state law antitrust claims for purposes of this motion. "
914,9," The court further stated it agreed with the language in City of Groton v. Connecticut Light & Power Co., 662 F.2d 921, 928-29 
(2d Cir. 1981) in which the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit stated, inter alia, ""we reject the notion that if 
there is a fraction of validity to each of the basic claims  [*45] and the sum of the fractions is one or more, the plaintiffs have 
proved a violation of section 1 or section 2 of the Sherman Act."" Id."
914,10," As noted by the court in Abbott Laboratories, ""Plaintiffs are entitled to claim that individual acts are antitrust violations, as well 
as claiming that those acts as a group have an anticompetitive effect even if the acts taken separately do not."" 432 F. Supp. 2d 
at 428. "
915,11, These are presumably the metabolism studies referenced in the complaints that Mutual commissioned in 2005. 
916,12," As alleged in the complaints, ""Mutual's earlier incentives to challenge King's invalid patents and seek early approval of its 
ANDA vanished. . . . It would make more money by helping King keep other  [*53] would-be competitors off the market than it 
could by launching its own generic metaxalone"" (DPP Compl. ¶ 180; EPP Compl. ¶ 174)."
916,13, Defendants contend the agreement in In re Cardizem I expressly precluded Andrx from entering the market. 
920,14," Defendants also argue Plaintiffs' claims pertaining to the citizen petitions are blocked pursuant to statute and under the 
applicable statute of limitations. With regard to the statute, Defendants point out that Section 505(q) of the FDCA states a 
pending citizen petition ""shall not delay approval of a pending [ANDA]"" unless the FDA determines the ""delay is necessary to 
protect public health"" (Court File No. 85 at 37). This policy went into effect September 27, 2007. Therefore, according to 
Defendants, any petitions filed after this date would not have delayed the approval process.  [*70] Plaintiffs, however, allege in 
their complaint that this system was not foul-proof. In fact, they even allege the FDA acknowledged in its March 2010 approval 
letter of Sandoz's ANDA that its delay was due in part to the citizen petitions filed by Defendants (DPP Compl. ¶ 262; EPP 
Compl. ¶ 264). Thus, there is a factual dispute regarding the effectiveness of the changes brought by Section 505(q) of the 
FDCA that need not be resolved at this time. Defendants also argue any petitions filed before September 2007 are outside the 
statute of limitations. Arguments pertaining to the statute of limitations, however, will be addressed later in this memorandum."
920,15," Citing Potters Med Ctr. v. City Hosp. Ass'n, 800 F.2d 568, 578 (6th Cir. 1986), Defendants claim the Supreme Court 
""recognized that 'unethical conduct in the setting of the adjudicatory process' . . . is unprotected by  [*72] the Noerr-Pennington 
doctrine."" Id. at 578 (quoting California Motor Transp. Co., 404 U.S. at 510). However, in attempting to narrow the scope of the 
application of the PRE test to just adjudicatory proceedings, Defendants neglect to mention their quote comes from California 
Motor, and the redacted portion expressly mentions agency proceedings. "
922,16," The TTPA expressly provides: All arrangements, contracts, agreements, trusts, or combinations between persons or corporations made with a view to 
lessen, or which tend to lessen, full and free competition in the importation or sale of articles imported into this state, or in 
the manufacture or sale of articles of domestic growth or of domestic raw material, and all  [*80] arrangements, contracts, 
agreements, trusts, or combinations between persons or corporations designed, or which tend, to advance, reduce, or 
control the price or the cost to the producer or the consumer of any such product or article, are declared to be against 
public policy, unlawful, and void. Tenn. Code Ann. § 47-25-101. "
923,17," When questioned by the Court at the hearing, even Defendants' counsel admitted he could not say offhand how much King 
actually received from its Skelaxin sales."
923,18," Finally, the Court observes that a number of cases cited by Defendants can be distinguished from the facts of the instant case. 
For instance, in In re Magnesium Oxide Antitrust Litig., Civ. No. 10-5943 DRD, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 121373, 2011 WL 
5008090, at *8 n.10 (D. N.J. Oct. 20, 2011), the district court dismissed a TTPA claim along with several other state claims 
because the plaintiffs' allegations were ""conclusory"" and ""fail[ed] to specifically tie their injuries to the alleged MgO conspiracy 
occurring  [*84] or its effects in those states."" See In re Flonase Antitrust Litig., 610 F. Supp. 2d 409, 416 (E.D. Pa. 2009) 
(concluding the TTPA claim must be dismissed because the plaintiffs failed to allege any substantial effects on Tennessee). 
However, as noted by the Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs, those cases are not directly analogous to the instant case because 
neither involved a defendant who was based in Tennessee nor did the plaintiffs adequately allege the defendants' conduct had 
""substantial effects"" on Tennessee commerce. Similarly, Medison Am., Inc. v. Preferred Med. Sys., LLC, 357 F. App'x 656 (6th 
Cir. 2009), is also distinguishable. Id. at 662-63 (dismissing the plaintiff's TTPA claim at summary judgment because the only "
924,," injury cited by the plaintiff, an ultrasound manufacturer, was its own, which the Sixth Circuit determined was insufficient to show 
a ""substantial effect"" on Tennessee trade or commerce). "
925,19," Neither Plaintiffs nor Defendants dispute that the statute of limitations is generally a matter that is raised as an affirmative 
defense. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(c). However, as noted by Defendants, ""a defendant can satisfy its burden when the complaint's 
allegations, taken as true, 'show that relief is barred by the applicable statute of limitations'"" (Court File No. 132 at 44 (citing 
Jones v. Bock, 549 U.S. 199, 215, 127 S. Ct. 910, 166 L. Ed. 2d 798 (2007)). "
926,20," On the facts of the RICO case before it, where the plaintiffs alleged the defendants made misrepresentations about a defective 
product over time, the Supreme Court ultimately concluded the plaintiffs' claims were time-barred. Id. at 190. "
927,21," The Areeda treatise, on the other hand, discounts the weight and authority of the Berkey Photo decision. 2 Phillip E. Areeda & 
Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law ¶ 320c4 (2d. Ed. 2000). "
928,22," Though not the basis for its decision, the court also opined ""the statute of limitations is not extended by continued sales at an 
allegedly monopolistic price because the 'monopolist's simple charging of its profit-maximizing price is a naturally expected 
consequence of a monopoly and can hardly be said to be [an] independent [act].'"" Id. (citing II Areeda & Hovenkamp, Antitrust 
Law, ¶ 320c4, at 298-99 (3d ed. 2007)). The court, again citing the Areeda treatise, also noted that ""if 'mere[ly] charging ... a 
monopoly price constitutes a 'continuing violation' tolling the statute, then we have indefinitely lengthened the statute of 
limitation."" Id. (citing II Areeda & Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law, ¶ 320c, at 286 (3d ed. 2007)). See DXS, Inc. v. Siemens Med. 
Sys., Inc., 100 F.3d 462, 467-68 (6th Cir. 1996) (observing that ""[a]cts that simply reflect or implement a prior refusal to deal . . . 
or acts that are merely 'unabated inertial consequences' (of a single act) . . . do not restart the statute of limitations"" (citations 
omitted)). While  [*101] this is one of Defendants' strongest arguments in favor of rejecting the notion that new sales of a product at an 
artificially inflated price by a monopolist should restart the limitations period, the Court observes that the instant case involves 
more than just the alleged monopolistic conduct of King. Here, the Court must also consider the broader anticompetitive scheme 
or conspiracy between King and Mutual as alleged by Plaintiffs. That conduct involved King and Mutual conspiring to delay the 
entry of a generic into the market and keeping the prices at an artificially inflated price. Presumably, taking into account both 
Defendants' overt acts to maintain the conspiracy—though most of those acts occurred outside of the limitations period—as well 
as the injurious acts that resulted in overcharges continuing into the limitations period, the Court could conclude Plaintiffs' claims 
adequately satisfy the continuing violations doctrine. Moreover, the Court observes Plaintiffs' damages would still be limited to 
the four year limitations period unless Plaintiffs are successful at proving fraudulent concealment, which would toll the statute of 
limitations."
928,23," The Court's decision, however, is also based in part upon the facts as they are alleged by the Plaintiffs. As the case develops 
and the facts are more fully fleshed out by the parties, the Court is willing to revisit the statute of limitations issue if it appears 
Plaintiffs' claims do, in fact, fall outside the applicable statute of limitations and the continuing violations doctrine does not apply. "
930,24," The state laws at issue include the antitrust laws of California, Florida, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New York, and North 
Carolina,  [*112] and the consumer protection statutes of Arkansas, California, Nebraska, and New York. Defendants argue 
Arizona and Kansas also apply the ""date of injury"" rule, whereas Plaintiffs argue they apply the ""discovery"" rule. Because the 
Court concludes under either rule at this stage the claims will not be dismissed, the Court need not resolve the dispute over the 
appropriate rule to apply at this time."
930,25," Although the Indirect Purchasers were not included in the Court's previous discussion of the continuing violation and 
fraudulent concealment doctrines, the Court acknowledges that the Indirect Purchasers' factual allegations are nearly identical to 
the Direct Purchasers and End Payors. Accordingly, the Court's determinations regarding whether Plaintiffs adequately alleged 
facts to support a continuing violation or the fraudulent concealment doctrine will also apply to the Indirect Purchasers at this 
stage. "
931,26," The laws at issue include the state antitrust laws of Massachusetts, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, and West Virginia, and 
the consumer protection statutes of Massachusetts, Missouri, and Virginia."
931,27," The parties also again rely on their prior arguments under federal law with respect to the doctrine of fraudulent concealment in 
arguing why the discovery rule should or should not apply. "
933,1," Previously, ADCLs were known as RCLs, or Regional Calibration Laboratories."
933,2," Theoretically, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (""NIST"") could perform the calibrations, but, as a practical 
matter, it is without the resources to do so, and has deferred to the AAPM to regulate calibrations. "
934,3," The guidelines governing ACDLS have been updated and revised over the years and are are currently known as the ""Criteria 
for Accreditation of Dosimetry Calibration Laboratories,"" or the ""Criteria."""
934,4," The provisions about labs being free of any conflict of interest with regard to ownership and/or business interests, and about 
the AAPM not being for the benefit of enterprises engaged in the manufacture, marketing, distribution of dosimetry instruments 
appeared in earlier incarnations of the Criteria and, indeed, the 1999 version contains virtually identical language. "
935,5, The majority of the European dosimetry equipment manufacturers are located in Germany.
935,6, Drs. DeWerd and Ibbott also opposed the idea of a dosimetry instrument manufacturer becoming an ADCL. 
936,7," Both of these sections are referenced in Section 1.b.2, the Conflict of Interest provision. Section 4.1.4 provides that ""if the 
laboratory is part of a larger organization, the responsibilities of key personnel shall be defined in order to identify potential 
conflicts of interest,"" and, in an accompanying note, states that ""if the laboratory is part of a larger organization, the 
organizational arrangements should be such that departments having conflicting interests such as production, commercial, 
marketing of financial do not adversely influence the laboratory's compliance with the requirements of this standard."" Section 
4.1.5, in turn, sets out requirements for laboratories, including that they ""[h]ave arrangements to ensure that [their] personnel 
 [*15] are free from any commercial, financial and other pressures that might affect the quality of their work."" "
938,8," There is a close relationship between Standard Imaging and UW ADCL, not only because of the geographical proximity, but 
also because Dr. DeWerd, the Director of the UW ADCL was one of the three founders of Standard Imaging, sits on its Board of 
Directors, and has owned one-third of the company since its formation in 1989."
938,9," In response to that letter, Maryellen Giger, President of the AAPM, sent a letter to Standard Imaging dated April 15, 2009, 
stating that any future action should be directed to her, or to PTW-Freiburg."
938,10," One of the recipients of the e-mail was Dr. David Followill, who is affiliated with M.D. Anderson as a result of his position with 
the Radiologic Physics Center. This Center is not a part of the M.D. Anderson ADCL."
938,11," ""TPC"" is an acronym for the Therapy Physics Committee."
938,12," Days after the meeting, Drs. Deluca, DeWerd and others at UW exchanged emails concerning the lack of response to Dr. 
DeLuca's letter of February 13, 2009. "
939,13," While the Science Council has broad ranging responsibilities on matters of concern to the AAPM, there is no evidence before 
the Court that the Science Council is involved in the accreditation process."
939,14," Dr. Ibbott had been excluded because he was a director of an ACDL that competed with K&S. He opposed K&S being 
accredited after the acquisition, and believed that the Criteria prohibited ownership of an ACDL by a dosimetry equipment 
manufacturer. "
940,15," At trial Dr. McEwen testified that his position on the issue evolved over time and was influenced by discussions with other 
CLA-X member during their teleconferences leading up to the July 29, 2009 vote which resulted in a vote recommending that 
K&S not be re-accredited."
940,16," A Standard Imaging brochure stated: ""Send your Standard Imagins Electometers, Well Chambers and Extradin Ion Chambers 
directly to Standard Imaging for Calibrations. We will perform  [*29] diagonistc tests and clean them before hand carrying them 
to the University of Wisconsin ADCL for calibration which is located only a few miles from our facility."" (Pf. Ex. 17). In a May 6, 
2009, email to Dr. Followill at M.D. Anderson (Pf. Ex. 18), Dr. Seuntjens himself observed that ""[w]ith regards to the [PTW] flyer, 
there are numerous examples on the Standard Imaging website that couple ADCL calibrations at UW in the context of package 
deals and it never triggered outbursts in the past since we know that the UW has professional people on the ground that will 
provide objective and professional advice."" In early June 2009, and undoubtedly as a result of the admonition PTW-Freiburg 
received, Standard Imaging decided that future promotional material would not refer to the UW ADCL by name. "
941,17," Because of the close relationship between the AAPM and NIST, NIST has always had a representative on the CLA-X."
941,18," According to Mr. White's contemporaneous notes which he read into the record a trial, there was ""bad karma"" in the air, and 
there ""[s]eems to be a bit of a relationship between University of Wisconsin and M.D. Anderson. General GOB, good ole boy 
feeling. Slowey, odd man out."" (Tr. Trans. at 541). "
942,19," Dr. Siegfried observed that, somewhat surprisingly, the models suggest that a reduction in the number of sellers from four to 
three may actually result in a more competitive industry."
942,20," According to Dr. Siegfried, with fewer sellers, deviations from a pricing agreement are easier to detect, and, therefore, the 
participants are less likely to deviate out of fear of being caught."
942,21," During this period, K&S would likely also lose valuable employees, making it an even less attractive purchase."
942,22, The UW ADCL has had one price increase in the past ten years. 
944,23," See, Cason-Merenda v. Detroit Medical Center, 862 F. Supp.2d 603, 625 (E.D. Mich. 2012). "
950,1, This rule is now known as REG106.1.
950,2," The meaning of ""elite"" is hazy. The AQHA claims that the term means what Plaintiffs' expert, Dr. Christopher Pflaum, calls ""top 
horses,"" perhaps the top 5% of the Quarter Horse market. Plaintiffs' first amended complaint suggests that elite means ""high 
quality registered Quarter Horses""—a subset of horses registered with the AQHA—but it is unclear whether Plaintiffs agree with

991,*, This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3. 
999,1," The  [**9] Board has appealed that decision. See North Carolina State Bd. of Dental Exam'rs v. FTC, No. 11-1679. In light of 
our opinion in this petition for review, we have dismissed that appeal as moot."
999,2," The Board also argues that the FTC lacked jurisdiction over it because it is not a ""person"" under the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. § 
45(a)(2). We find this argument to be without merit. The Supreme Court has held that a state is a ""person"" under the Sherman 
Act and the Clayton Act. Jefferson Cnty. Pharm. Ass'n v. Abbott Labs., 460 U.S. 150, 155, 103 S. Ct. 1011, 74 L. Ed. 2d 882 
(1983) (Clayton Act); City of Lafayette v. La. Power & Light Co., 435 U.S. 389, 395, 98 S. Ct. 1123, 55 L. Ed. 2d 364 (1978) 
(Sherman Act). In Jefferson County, the Court noted it  [**11] did not ""perceive any reason to construe the word 'person' in [the "
1000,," Sherman] Act any differently than we have in the Clayton Act."" Jefferson Cnty., 460 U.S. at 156. Given the similarities between 
the FTC Act and the Clayton and Sherman Acts, we likewise find that the Board is a ""person"" under the FTC Act."
1000,3," The Board repeatedly asserted at oral argument that it is ""sovereign"" within the meaning of Parker. The Supreme Court has 
recognized two entities as ""sovereign"" under Parker—the state legislature and the state supreme court when ""acting 
legislatively."" Hoover v. Ronwin, 466 U.S. 558, 567-68, 104 S. Ct. 1989, 80 L. Ed. 2d 590 (1984)(citing Parker, 317 U.S. at 351

court)).  [**13] The actions of these entities are ""ipso facto"" exempt from the antitrust laws. Id. at 568. It is obvious that a state 
agency comprised of privately employed dentists is not the ""sovereign"" equivalent of the state legislature or state supreme court."
1000,4," The Hallie Court also included the following footnote addressing state agencies: In cases in which the actor is a state agency, it is likely that active state supervision would also not be required, although 
we do not here decide that issue. Where state or municipal regulation by a private party is involved, however, active state 
supervision must be shown, even where a clearly articulated state policy exists. Town of Hallie v. City of Eau Claire, 471 U.S. 34, 46 n.10, 105 S. Ct. 1713, 85 L. Ed. 2d 24 (1985). Relying on this footnote, the 
Board maintains that, because it is categorized as a state agency by North Carolina, it, too, is not required to show active 
supervision. This footnote, however, does not bear quite the weight the Board suggests. First, in Southern Motor Carriers Rate 
Conference, Inc. v. United States, 471 U.S. 48, 57, 105 S. Ct. 1721, 85 L. Ed. 2d 36 (1985), issued the same day as Hallie, the 
Court stated that Midcal continued to define ""most specifically"" the situations in which ""state  [**14] agencies"" were entitled to 
the Parker exemption. Second, as the FTC explained in rejecting the Board's argument, ""the dicta in footnote 10 of Hallie must 
be reconciled with the Court's other language and reasoning in that same decision,"" including its discussion of Goldfarb v. 
Virginia State Bar, 421 U.S. 773, 95 S. Ct. 2004, 44 L. Ed. 2d 572 (1975), which we discuss infra at 15-16. Interlocutory Order, 
151 F.T.C. at 625. Although we find the dicta in Hallie inapplicable in the instant case, where the ""state agency"" is composed 
entirely of private market participants, our opinion should not be read as precluding more quintessential state agencies from 
arguing that they need not satisfy the active supervision requirement. "
1002,5," In reaching this conclusion, we specifically found that we were ""not bound by the State court's characterization of the boards."" 
Asheville Tobacco, 263 F.2d at 509."
1002,6," Although the Board points to several cases concluding that a state agency did not have to demonstrate active supervision, 
these cases do not create the bright-line rule that the Board requests. See Earles v. State Bd. of Certified Public Accountants of 
Louisiana, 139 F.3d 1033, 1041 (5th Cir. 1998); Bankers Ins. Co. v. Florida Residential Prop. & Cas. Joint Underwriting Ass'n, 
137 F.3d 1293, 1296-97 (11th Cir. 1998); Hass v. Oregon State Bar, 883 F.2d 1453, 1460 (9th Cir. 1989); Gambrel v. Kentucky 
Bd. of Dentistry, 689 F.2d 612, 620-21 (6th Cir. 1982). Instead, in each case, those courts merely determined  [**21] that the 
particular state agency at issue was more akin to a municipality than a private actor. See, e.g., Earles, 139 F.3d at 1041 (noting 
the ""Board is functionally similar to a municipality""); Hass, 883 F.2d at 1460 (review of state provisions left ""no doubt that the Bar 
is a public body, akin to a municipality for purposes of the state action exemption""). "
1004,7," The Board's expert testified that the Board is concerned about the financial interests of dentists, and that there ""is a financial 
aspect"" to the decision to exclude the non-dentist teeth whiteners. (J.A. 580)."
1004,8," The fact that the Board members may have a unity of purpose in the particular restraint at issue—expelling non-dentist teeth 
whiteners from the market—does not render them incapable of conspiring under § 1, because some ""commonality of interest 
exists in every cartel."" Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Comm'n v. NFL, 726 F.2d 1381, 1389 (9th Cir. 1984). The salient fact is 
that the Board members, in their private business, remain ""separately controlled, potential competitors."" American Needle, 130 
S.Ct. at 2215. "
1005,9," The Board renews its argument—made with regard to the state action doctrine—that enforcement of state law can never be an 
antitrust conspiracy. As previously discussed, the Board was acting to regulate third parties in a manner not authorized by state 
law."
1005,10," The per se analysis, which ""permits courts to make 'categorical judgments' that certain practices, including price fixing, 
horizontal output restraints, and market-allocation agreements,"" are per se violative of § 1, is not at issue in this case because 
the FTC utilized the ""quick look"" and full rule of reason analysis. Continental Airlines, 277 F.3d at 509 (quoting Nw. Wholesale 
Stationers, Inc. v. Pac. Stationery & Printing Co., 472 U.S. 284, 289, 105 S. Ct. 2613, 86 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1985))."
1005,11," The FTC referred to the quick look analysis as the ""inherently suspect"" approach, consistent with its earlier ruling in In re 
Polygram Holding, Inc., 136 F.T.C. 310 (2003), aff'd Polygram Holding, Inc. v. FTC, 416 F.3d 29, 367 U.S. App. D.C. 367 (D.C. 
Cir. 2005). "
1006,12," The Board argues that FTC failed to consider its justification, that it ""acted pursuant to state law,"" and was ""motivated by public 
protection concerns."" (Appellant's Br. at 57). The FTC found that, even assuming these were appropriate justifications for 
anticompetitive behavior, the  [**35] Board failed to adduce factual support. The FTC recounted that the Board members pointed 
to ""theoretical"" risks of teeth-whitening services without ""any clinical or empirical evidence validating"" the risks and that the 
Board could only point to four anecdotal cases of consumer injury ""over a multi-year period based on products considered safe 
by the FDA and used over a million times over the last twenty years."" Final Order, 2011 FTC LEXIS 290, 2011 WL 6229615, at 
*33. The FTC likewise noted the ""lack of contemporaneous evidence that the challenged conduct was motivated by health or 
safety concerns."" Id. We find this conclusion supported by substantial evidence. "
1007,*," The separate features supporting the Board's position included: (1) the North Carolina legislature's designation of the Board ""as 
the agency of the State for the regulation of the practice of dentistry in this State,"" N.C.G.S. § 90-22(b); (2) the designation of 
Board members as ""State employees,"" N.C.G.S. § 93B-16(b); (3) the Board members' entitlement to sovereign immunity and 
legal defense by the state attorney general, N.C.G.S. §§ 93B-16(c), 143-300.3; (4) the oath Board members are required to take 
promising to uphold North Carolina's laws and protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public, N.C. CONST. art. VI, § 7; (5) "
1008,," the potential that Board members may be punished by the North Carolina Ethics Commission if the members act in a manner 
that presents a conflict of interest, N.C.G.S. §§ 138A-10, 12(o); and (6) the review powers over the Board enjoyed by the North 
Carolina Joint Legislative Commission on Governmental  [**41] Operations, which has the power to study state agency activities 
regarding ""conformity with legislative intent,"" N.C.G.S. § 120-76(1)(d). "
1010,1, Defendants' motion at Dkt. No. 36 for leave to file excess pages is hereby granted.
1010,2," The facts alleged in the Complaint are taken as true for purposes of this motion to dismiss and all reasonable inferences are 
drawn in Plaintiffs' favor. The Complaint, and the parties, devote a great deal of energy to arguing the policy merits of co-pay 
subsidies. To the extent that the facts alleged in support of these policy arguments do not bear on the legal analysis of Plaintiffs' 
claims, those facts are excluded from this background section."
1010,3," AB-rated generics are, by definition, substitutable for their branded equivalents. Therapeutic alternatives are not bioequivalent 
to their brand-name counterparts, but are alternative medicines that treat the same medical condition in a similar way."
1010,4," The Abilify Savings Card states that it is ""not an insurance card."" The front of the card instructs pharmacists on how to process 
the card as ""secondary coverage."" "
1011,5," Plaintiffs allege that ""co-pay programs work,"" relying on a 2011 study based on evidence from co-pay subsidy  [**6] program 
administrators that concludes that ""25% of [co-pay subsidy program] use results in a [subsidized] drug being used instead of a 
preferred brand or generic that might have been used in the absence of the [subsidy]."" "
1013,6, A related allegation appears at paragraph 97 of the Complaint:
1013,97," . Defendants and their co-conspirator administrator make misrepresentations via the wires at the time of the point of sale 
transaction — that is, when the member presents the co-pay card at the pharmacy — when, as instructed by the 
defendants, the pharmacist electronically charges the health benefit provider the full benchmark price without accounting 
for the existence of co-pay subsidies. These transactions necessarily involve use of the wires."
1013,7, A related allegation appears at paragraph 98 of the Complaint:
1013,98," . Defendants make additional misrepresentations via the mail and wires when defendants report benchmark prices to 
reporting agencies while failing to account for the routine waiver of co-pays. These transactions necessarily involve the use 
of the mail and wires. "
1014,8," The only potential misrepresentation in Plaintiffs' narrative occurs when Defendants provide information to pharmacies on the 
co-pay subsidy cards about how to enter subsidy  [**21] information, but Plaintiffs do not allege that any information contained 
on the co-pay cards is false and do not explain how such misrepresentations made by Defendants to pharmacies could serve as 
the predicate act for a RICO claim brought by Plaintiffs (a matter that implicates both the predicate act requirement and RICO's 
requirement of proximate causation). "
1015,9," Plaintiffs have not asserted a claim of tortious interference with the contractual arrangements in place between pharmacies and 
TPPs, or with those between insureds and TPPs. "
1016,10," The Ninth Circuit relied in part on analogy to Kennedy: ""The same reasoning applies here. Delta Dental concedes that if 
SmileCare paid the patient the co-payment, and the patient then paid the dentist, it would have no objection or cause to find its 
providers in breach of contract. This would mirror the scenario with the rich aunt. However, because SmileCare pays the dentist, 
the legal obligation required of the insured is eliminated, distorting the actuarial basis for Delta Dental's co-payment plan."" 
SmileCare, 88 F.3d at 784 (footnote omitted)."
1016,11," Plaintiffs cite Tom v. Hawaii Dental Serv., 606 F. Supp. 584 (D. Haw. 1985), to bolster their point. Yet it offers nothing more 
than does Feiler. In Tom, as in Feiler, the fact pattern involved a dentist who, in violation of an insurer's policy, profited by 
misstating his actual fees to insurers and then waiving patients' co-pay obligations. The dentist had filed suit against the insurers 
in federal court, alleging that they engaged in price-fixing and monopoly. Focusing on the dentist's standing to raise this 
argument, Judge Pence of the District of Hawaii rejected the argument that he had standing to assert an injury by virtue of the 
insurers' refusal to allow him to waive the patients' required co-pay. Quoting from Feiler, Tom observed that ""it has been held 
that waiver of copayments is a fraudulent and deceptive business practice and is actionable by any dentist."" Id. at 586. Thus, 
Tom stands only for the same proposition as Feiler: it is fraudulent for dentists to engage in a scheme to systematically 
overcharge insurance companies in violation of their contractual obligations,  [**29] while at the same time routinely and secretly 
waiving patients' co-pay requirements. The Court takes no position on whether these cases—one decided by a New Jersey state "
1017,," trial court in 1983, the other by a district court in another jurisdiction in 1985—accurately state the law applicable to this case. It 
suffices to observe that neither of these cases supports the legal rule advanced by Plaintiffs."
1017,12," Plaintiff's other case citations are equally unavailing. Reynolds v. California Dental Serv., 200 Cal. App. 3d 590, 593, 246 Cal. 
Rptr. 331 (Ct. App. 1988), dealt with allegations of illegal price fixing under sections 16720  [**30] and 16750 of the Cartwright 
Act. Id. That state court saw no violation where a dental insurance company's provider contract included two disputed provisions: 
one requiring providers to make ""reasonable efforts to collect from an eligible patient the entire amount"" of any co-pay, and the 
other stating that the insurer would not pay a dentist for a service more than he or she actually charged or usually charged for 
that service. Id. at 594-96. Reynolds, like several other cases cited by Plaintiffs, dealt only with contractual agreements and only 
with the alleged anti-competitive effects of certain agreements pertaining to non-waiver rules. Plaintiffs also rely on OSF Healthcare Sys. v. Banno, No. 08-1096, ECF No. 61 (C.D. Ill. March 30, 2009). In that case, the court 
initially concluded that ""[t]he Complaint fails to sufficiently allege that Peoria Day owed a legal duty to Caterpillar,"" and that it 
failed ""to specifically allege how or why Defendants had a legal duty to Caterpillar to charge and/or collect co-payments from 
Caterpillar members."" OSF Healthcare Sys. v. Banno, 08-1096, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 100230, 2008 WL 5170628, at *3 (C.D. 
Ill. Dec. 10, 2008). Plaintiff then filed an amended complaint, in which it  [**31] alleged as follows: Caterpillar's co-insurance payment obligations imposed on Caterpillar Members were created by Caterpillar's various health 
benefit plans offered to the Members . . . . Caterpillar Members were responsible for paying the balance of the charges (co-
insurance). Benefits for covered services were either paid to the Member or, far more often, assigned by the Members to 
the health care providers, such as PDSC, which would then bill their charges directly to Caterpillar. By agreeing with the 
Member to accept an assignment of benefits, PDSC would receive direct payment from Caterpillar, as provided by the 
Caterpillar health benefit plans, and agreed that it was entitled, pursuant to the terms of those health benefit plans, to no 
more benefits than was the Caterpillar Member under the benefit plans The benefit plans provided that Caterpillar would compute its payment of benefits to the member or his/her assignee based 
only on the charged fees the Member was legally required to pay. By accepting an assignment of benefits under the 
Caterpillar benefit plans, PDSC was obligated to bill and attempt to collect the co-insurance from the Member. First Am. Compl. ¶¶ 14-15, OSF Healthcare  [**32] Sys. v. Banno, No. 08-1096, ECF No. 48 (C.D. Ill. Jan 16, 2009). This 
Complaint then survived a motion to dismiss. Thus, OSF is yet another case in which allegations pertaining to a duty to enforce 
co-pay requirements flowed from a contractual arrangement between private parties, not any sort of free-standing legal rule 
based in tort or criminal law that would have rendered it fraudulent for the provider to routinely waive and conceal the waiver of 
co-pays."
1017,13," In the Complaint, Plaintiffs include an image of the Abilify co-pay card, which states that ""if your health insurance is covered by 
any state or federally funded programs such as Medicare or Medicaid . . . you may not be eligible for the ABILIFY Savings Card."" "
1018,14," Plaintiffs cite a Colorado statute that does not alter the Court's analysis. This law provides that ""if the effect is to eliminate the 
need for payment by the patient of any required deductible or copayment applicable in the patient's health benefit plan, a person 
who provides health care commits abuse of health insurance if the person knowingly: (a) Accepts from any third-party payor, as 
payment in full for services rendered, the amount the third-party payor covers; or (b) Submits a fee to a third-party payor which is 
higher than the fee he has agreed to accept from the insured patient with the understanding of waiving the required 
 [**34] deductible or copayment."" Colo. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 18-13-119 (West). This statute does not prohibit co-pay subsidies by 
manufacturers; rather, it prohibits health care providers from waiving co-pays. In the Complaint, Plaintiffs also refer to a Massachusetts law that bans co-pay coupons for private payers; since the Complaint 
was filed, Massachusetts has amended this statute to permit co-pay subsidies for drugs, like Abilify, that lack an AB-rated 
generic equivalent as determined by the FDA. See 2012 Mass. Legis. Serv. Ch. 139 (H.B. 4200) (West) (codified at Mass. Gen. 
Laws. Ch. 175H § 3(b)). "
1019,15," For example, Plaintiffs state in their brief that ""AWPs must have a reasonable and fair relationship to the actual price charged 
by the manufacturer,"" citing a case that, in construing the term ""AWP"" in the federal Medicare statute as a matter of law, 
described what some people in the pharmaceutical and regulatory fields thought about AWP price benchmarks at a particular 
moment in time. See In re Pharm. Indus. Average Wholesale Price Litig., 460 F. Supp. 2d 277, 284 (D. Mass. 2006). Similarly, 
Defendants argue that AWP is defined based on a mathematical mark-up over WAC, citing for this proposition part of the 
""Findings of Fact"" in  [**39] another case. See In re Pharm. Indus. Average Wholesale Price Litig., 491 F. Supp. 2d 20, 33 (D. 
Mass. 2007), aff'd, 582 F.3d 156 (1st Cir. 2009). The parties rely on many other statements from the AWP litigation that do not 
count as part of the record in this case. Thus, to cite one of many possible examples from the briefing in this case, Plaintiffs look 
to the AWP Court's conclusion that gross inflation of AWPs is an unfair and deceptive business practice, even though that court 
reached this finding after noting that ""[t]he key question in this litigation is whether causing the publication of an AWP that greatly 
exceeds the average sales price charged to a doctor or pharmacist for certain drugs covered by Medicare Part B is an unfair or 
deceptive trade practice under Chapter 93A."" Id. at 94 (emphasis added). Simply put, the AWP Court's conclusions of law bear 
almost exclusively on issues that are not relevant here, while the portions of its opinion relied upon by the parties and described 
in their filings as ""holdings"" actually qualify as findings of fact or as mixed questions of law and fact. The doctrine of issue 
preclusion is not applicable here and there is no basis for taking  [**40] judicial notice in this case of the truth of facts found on 
the basis of a record compiled in the AWP litigation. Further, counsel to both parties offered detailed testimony at oral argument, 
including statements about industry expectations and norms, Defendants' business practices regarding WAC and AWP, and 
their prior litigation experience. These in-court statements by counsel do not bear on the analysis undertaken here. "
1020,16," Paragraph 58 is confusing for other reasons. For example, it alleges that when pharmacy retailers buy a drug from a 
manufacturer, they pay a reported benchmark price that is ""required to be a reasonably fair estimate of the actual price for the 
ingredient cost of the drug to the retailer."" It then alleges that when pharmacies sell that drug, they charge the ingredient cost 
plus a dispensing fee, and ""[t]he amount to be charged  [**44] for the ingredient cost is based on a percentage discount from the 
benchmark (e.g., AWP minus 14% for all branded drugs)."" As a matter of common sense, if the reported benchmark is ""required"" 
to represent the ""actual price"" to the pharmacy of buying the drug from the manufacturer, it seems surprising that pharmacies 
regularly charge a percentage discount less than that reported benchmark value when selling the drug, unless the standard 
dispensing fee is sufficient to compensate for the loss and create a profit. Plaintiffs' failure to clarify the precise relationship 
between WAC and AWP becomes significant in this regard, as Plaintiffs do not specify which benchmark—WAC, AWP, both, or 
some other—is subject to these industry expectations and is being relied upon in these transactions. In the same vein, 
Paragraph 58's general allegation that TPPs' ""reimbursement to the pharmacy is based"" on benchmark prices is far too vague to 
satisfy RICO's proximate causation requirement. "
1021,17," Judge Karas quotes a practitioner's observation that ""[l]inguistically, Section 2(c) is a genuine piece of art. It has 115 words, all 
in one sentence. There are no semicolons, no clauses, just a few commas—and there has even been a debate about whether 
the commas are in the right places. As you might expect in such a situation, no one has ever come forward to take full 
responsibility for its drafting."" World Wrestling Entm't, Inc. v. Jakks Pac., Inc., 425 F. Supp. 2d 484, 522 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) aff'd, 
328 F. App'x 695 (2d Cir. 2009) (quoting Mark L. Yeager, Developments—1984: Living with the Robinson—Patman Act, 53 
Antitrust L.J. 1029 (1985)). "
1023,18," This point is illustrated by New York law. As Judge McKenna has observed: Generally, [u]nder New York law the relationship between an insurance company and a policyholder is a contractual 
relationship, not a fiduciary one. Certainly under the right circumstances, the relationship between insurer and insured may 
be imbued with elements of trust and confidence which render the relationship more than a mere arm's-length association. 
However, such special circumstances ""are the exception rather than the rule."" Schandler v. New York Life Ins. Co., No. 9 Civ. 10463, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46322, 2011 WL 1642574, at *12 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 
26, 2011) (citation omitted). In other words, to the extent that such duties ever exist, courts will not lightly infer the existence of 
fiduciary duties on the part of an insured to a healthcare  [**56] insurer, as these relationships are usually defined by contract. "
1024,19," Plaintiffs do allege at ¶ 153 that ""[D]efendants' co-pay subsidy program results in injury to DC 37, Sergeants, and the class 
because the payments result in more purchases of the subsidized drug by plaintiffs and the class than would have been made 
absent the illegal inducements."" (emphasis  [**62] added). For the reasons explained infra, this characterization of Plaintiffs as 
purchasers is inconsistent with the market as described generally in the Complaint. In any event, because Plaintiffs' status for 
purposes of commercial bribery doctrine is a mixed question of fact and law, the conclusory assertion that Plaintiffs qualify as 
buyers for purposes of the RPA does not suffice even at this pleading stage. See Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. "
1025,20," In the alternative, the insurer and insured might be characterized as co-buyers. In that scenario, neither could be described as 
an intermediary of the other and the parties might owe each other certain fiduciary duties in relation to the transaction—though, 
even accepting such a premise, the existence of such duties would be doubtful given the contractual nature of their co-buyer 
relationship and there is no reason to believe that any such duties would extend to the prior step of choosing which medication 
to make the subject of the exchange. "
1030,1," C-SPAN also moves to dismiss for lack of injury. See Def.'s Mot. Dismiss & Mem. Supp. (Dkt. No. 5) at 27-32. Because 
 [**9] that analysis encompasses additional considerations of ""antitrust injury"" beyond the minimum constitutional requirement 
established by Article III, the Court will analyze injury as part of its Rule 12(b)(6) analysis and not as a matter of jurisdiction. See 
also Sprint Nextel Corp. v. AT&T Inc., 821 F. Supp. 2d 308, 312 n.1 (D.D.C. 2011). "
1031,2," The Court similarly finds curious C-SPAN's characterization of this issue as a failure to exhaust administrative remedies, as C-
SPAN denies that ""exhaustion"" of the Section 628 administrative adjudication process would then confer jurisdiction upon 
 [**14] this Court. It seems appropriate for the Court to consider the doctrine of primary jurisdiction, under which it may postpone this case and 
direct Sky Angel to pursue this matter as a Section 628 claim before the FCC in the first instance. See, e.g., United States v. W. 
Pac. R.R. Co., 352 U.S. 59, 63-64, 77 S. Ct. 161, 1 L. Ed. 2d 126, 135 Ct. Cl. 997 (1956) (""Primary jurisdiction . . . applies where 
a claim is originally cognizable in the courts, and comes into play whenever enforcement of the claim requires the resolution of 
issues which, under a regulatory scheme, have been placed within the special competence of an administrative body; in such a 
case the judicial process is suspended pending referral of such issues to the administrative body for its views."" (internal 
quotation marks omitted)). C-SPAN, however, has expressly disavowed any desire to pursue this option, see Def.'s Reply Supp. 
Mot. Dismiss (Dkt. No. 8) at 4 n.1, and the Court will not invoke the primary jurisdiction doctrine sua sponte at this juncture. "
1034,3," C-SPAN also argues that the product market definition fails because C-SPAN does not compete in that market. However, the 
Court finds that such an analysis is better undertaken when determining whether the defendant holds market power over the 
relevant market, however defined. See infra Part III.B.3.c. "
1036,4," Sky Angel's allegation appears to include all cable MVPDs, and not just those represented on C-SPAN's board."
1036,5," Although some courts use the term ""antitrust injury"" to sweep in the full scope of injury analysis in an antitrust case—including 
the Article III standard required in every federal proceeding—the Court uses the term ""antitrust injury"" in this opinion to refer 
specifically to the additional requirement articulated in Brunswick. See also 2A Areeda et al., supra, ¶¶ 335c4, 337a. "
1037,6," C-SPAN also argues that Sky Angel has not alleged any injury to competition. See Def.'s Mot. Dismiss & Mem.  [**38] Supp. 
(Dkt. No. 5) at 30; Def.'s Reply Supp. Mot. Dismiss (Dkt. No. 8) at 14. This, however, would not mean that Sky Angel lacks 
""antitrust standing,"" but would instead mean that there is no antitrust violation at all. See 2A Areeda et al., supra, ¶ 337a (""To 
say that the plaintiff has not shown any injury to competition is to conclude that the antitrust laws have not been violated at all. 
[This is not] 'antitrust injury' in the sense that Brunswick used the term . . . .""). Regardless, the complaint clearly alleges that 
termination of C-SPAN's programming on the lower-priced FAVE-TV has allowed the cable MVPDs to ""shield themselves from 
the downward pressure on market prices that would result from the competitive effect of"" Sky Angel's participation and that, ""[b]y 
artificially maintaining their dominance in the MVPD market in this way, the cable MVPDs have perpetuated the current, high-
price status quo and denying [sic] millions of U.S. consumers the full economic benefit of competition."" Compl. (Dkt. No. 1) ¶ 51."
1037,7," Because there can be no antitrust violation without an injury to competition, it may seem contradictory to ""postulate[] that 
competition can be simultaneously impaired (thereby  [**39] violating the antitrust laws) and enhanced (thereby causing the "
1038,," plaintiff noncognizable losses). There is no real contradiction, because the impairment and enhancement lie in different temporal 
or market dimensions, as the Brunswick case itself illustrates."" 2A Areeda et al., supra, ¶ 337a. "
1061,1," It appears that one ADP resides in Hawaii. That complaint in that case was filed under seal as required by state law. Because 
the attorney general declined to prosecute the action, the complaint has been unsealed, and the ADP has been given 
permission to proceed by the deputy attorney general. (See Doc. No. 390, Ex. 2). "
1086,1, The following background is taken from the factual allegations of Plaintiff's complaint.
1086,2," On November 1, 2012, the Attorney General of Pennsylvania announced that former Penn State officials Curley and Schultz, 
and former Penn State President Graham Spanier, had been indicted by a grand jury on charges of perjury, conspiracy, "
1087,," obstruction  [**5] of justice, and child endangerment in connection with their alleged role in covering up Sandusky's crimes. 
These cases have not yet been brought to trial. (Doc. No. 1 ¶ 39.)"
1087,3," Imposition of the football ""death penalty"" would have cancelled Penn State's  [**6] football program for four years. "
1089,4," ""The Postbaccalaureate Bylaw provides that a student-athlete may not participate in intercollegiate athletics at a postgraduate 
institution other than in the institution from which the student earned her undergraduate degree."" Smith, 139 F.3d at 183. "
1090,5," In NCAA v. Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma, 468 U.S. 85, 94, 104 S. Ct. 2948, 82 L. Ed. 2d 70 (1986), the 
Supreme Court distinguished between ""most of the regulatory controls of the NCAA . . . [as] justifiable means of fostering 
competition among amateur athletic teams,"" in contrast to the ""specific restraints on football telecasts"" at issue that violated 
Section 1. Id. at 117."
1090,6," Many other courts have relied on Smith's distinction between the NCAA's commercial and non-commercial rulemaking. See 
Bassett v. NCAA, 528 F.3d 426, 433 (6th Cir. 2008) (""The Complaint is wholly devoid of any allegation on the commercial nature 
of NCAA's enforcement of the rules it determined Bassett violated . . . . We find Bassett's Complaint lacks the critical commercial 
activity component required to permit application of the Sherman Act""); Worldwide Basketball & Sport Tours v. NCAA, 388 F.3d 
955, 959 (6th Cir. 2004)  [**16] (""The dispositive inquiry in this regard is whether the rule itself is commercial, not whether the 
entity promulgating the rule is commercial.""); Bowers v. NCAA, 9 F.Supp.2d 460, 497 (D.N.J. 1998) (academic eligibility rules 
non-commercial in nature)."
1090,7," See, e.g., Smith v. NCAA, 139 F.3d 180 (3d Cir. 1999); Justice v. NCAA, 577 F. Supp. 356 (D. Ariz. 1983). In each such 
instance, the courts have consistently held that Defendant's ability to enforce its bylaws relating to preserving amateurism and 
the tradition of intercollegiate athletics does not touch on commercial activity and therefore should not be circumscribed by the "
1091,," antitrust laws. See, e.g., Bassett, 528 F.3d at 433 (""Similar to the eligibility rules in Smith, NCAA's rules on recruiting student 
athletes, specifically those rules prohibiting improper inducements and academic fraud, are all explicitly non-commercial""). "
1092,8," See Bassett v. NCAA, No. 04-425, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17570, 2005 WL 3767016, at *3 (E.D. Ky. May 3, 2005) (""Rather 
than intending to provide the NCAA or any of its member schools with a commercial advantage, enforcement of rules governing 
 [**24] recruiting, improper inducements, and academic fraud primarily seek to ensure fair competition"") (citation and internal 
quotation marks omitted). "
1093,9," The Court also observes that Penn State is not excluded from any of the relevant markets identified in its complaint. 
Furthermore, Penn State is still able to compete in NCAA-sponsored football games. "
1094,10," Defendant's actions are typically subject to review under the rule of reason. See Bd. of Regents, 468 U.S. at 100-01. 
Underlying this principle is the Supreme Court's recognition that ""a certain degree of cooperation is necessary if the type of 
competition that [the NCAA] seek[s] to market be preserved . . . . [i]t is reasonable to assume that most of the regulatory controls 
of the NCAA are justifiable means of fostering competition among amateur athletic teams and therefore procompetitive."" Bd. of 
Regents, 468 U.S. at 117. "
1095,11," See Com. of Pa. v. Porter, 659 F.2d 306, 316 (3d Cir. 1981)."
1095,12," Although Plaintiff alleges a violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1, its right to injunctive relief arises under 
Section 16 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 26."
1095,13," See Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law, § 355 (2012). "
1096,14," See City of Pittsburgh v. W. Penn Power Co., 147 F.3d 256, 268 (3d Cir. 1998). The Third Circuit has held that the antitrust 
standing inquiry is essentially the same in the context of injunctive relief, except that when seeking injunctive relief, the 
complainant need only demonstrate a significant threat of injury from an impending violation of the antitrust laws. Id. "
1099,1," Defendant refers to this same agreement as the ""FY 2008 Dealer Agreement."" Because the Complaint refers to it as the ""2007 
Dealer Agreement,"" I have as well. Additionally, even though the Complaint refers to the ""2007 Dealer Agreement"" in the 
singular, there were multiple 2007 Dealer Agreements pertaining to multiple geographic areas. Exhibit A-1 to the March 27, 2013 
Hawkes Declaration contains a full copy of the 2007 Dealer Agreement for Plaintiff's Brea, California location, as well as relevant 
pages from identical 2007 Dealer Agreements pertaining to Oregon and Washington. "
1100,2," This was extended to May 31, 2013. "
1101,3," The elements for establishing a tying violation under these two statutes ""are virtually the same"" and the court treats them alike 
in its analysis. Airweld, Inc. v. Airco, Inc., 742 F.2d 1184, 1189 n.2 (9th Cir. 1984)."
1101,4," Paragraph 3(a) is the same in the 2007 Dealer  [**12] Agreement and the 2012 Dealer Agreement. Exs. A-1, A-3 to Hawkes 
Decl. "
1102,5," While the parties' relationship predates the 2007 Dealer Agreement, the Complaint recites terms of only the 2007 Dealer 
Agreement and Defendant bases its motion and argument on that agreement. "
1103,6," The defendant actually held the license from the manufacturer, but the court treated the defendant as the manufacturer itself. "
1106,7," Moreover, given Plaintiff's representation that the antitrust claim was not ripe until spring of 2012 when suitable alternative 
supplies first became available, any allegations of third parties being coerced under threat of termination would have to relate to 
that time period or later."
1106,8," While not clearly alleged in the Complaint, Plaintiff contends that it alleges the existence of a separate tying agreement related 
to Defendant's sale of parts to Plaintiff after Plaintiff's termination as a dealer. Compl. at ¶ 19. This allegation refers to 
statements Defendant allegedly made in the September 20, 2012 letter regarding paragraph  [**30] 5(d) of the 2012 Dealer 
Agreement. I find no such reference to paragraph 5(d) in that letter, or to any other subsection of paragraph 5 of the 2012 Dealer 
Agreement. Ex. A-4 to Mar. 27, 2013 Hawkes Decl. Putting that issue aside, I note that this allegation does not appear in the 
section of the Complaint reciting the allegations in support of the antitrust claim, Compl. at ¶¶ 24-36, or in the allegations recited 
in support of the First Claim for Relief for Illegal Tying. Id. at ¶¶ 37-47. Although Plaintiff attempted to explain this claim in its 
response to the motion to dismiss, at this point, I agree with Defendant that the claim is so vaguely asserted that it cannot stand 
as pleaded. Furthermore, even if it were more clearly stated, it would be dismissed for the same reasons as the primary tying 
claim discussed above."
1106,9," I do not separately address Plaintiff's argument regarding its requested injunctive relief other than to note that because the 
doctrine of laches is coextensive with the statute of limitations, the same time period will apply, regardless of the nature of the 
relief. Aurora Enters., 688 F.2d at 694 (""four-year statute of limitations . . . furnishes a guideline for computation  [**31] of the 
laches period in antitrust suits) (citing Int'l Tel. & Tel. Corp. v. Gen. Tel. & Elecs. Corp., 518 F.2d 913, 929 (9th Cir. 1975) (""the 
four-year limitation period in Clayton Act § 4B, 15 U.S.C. § 15b, furnishes a guideline for computation of the laches period""), 
disapproved of on other grounds, Cal. v. Am. Stores Co., 495 U.S. 271, 110 S. Ct. 1853, 109 L. Ed. 2d 240 (1990)). "
1111,10, I decline to address the separate improper venue argument. 
1116,1," 998,628 x 5 = $4,993,140, not $4,943,140. The court does not know whether there was an arithmetic mistake, or whether the 
number of units sold was stated  [*4] incorrectly."
1116,2," 4,993,140 - 1,125,000 = 3,868,140. 4,943,140 - 1,125,000 = 3,818,140. In its memorandum of law (at 3), MPEG states that the 
balance is $3,888,140, but that is, no doubt, a typographical error. "
1124,1," ASHRAE claims that Thermal Design's comment proposed raising the target U-Factors for metal building roofs and walls; 
however, the evidence to which it cites does not support its proposed facts in this regard. "
1126,2," Approvals of CMPs or Subcommittee/Committee proposals require a two-thirds majority vote of those voting and a majority of 
all voting members of the consensus body to vote, including the 90.1 Committee. (DPFOF ¶ 20.)"
1126,3," At this time, Skalko and Van Geem represented only a single vote. It was not until the June 2007 vote that they represented 
separate votes. (Pl.'s Resp. to DPFOF ¶ 73.) "
1128,4," Thermal Design indicates that Brad Rowe was not included in the MBTG until May 15, 2008. (Pl.'s Resp. to DPFOF ¶¶ 111-12.) "
1130,5," Hal Robbins is from Lamtec, a facing manufacturer used in the insulation in most over-the-purlin insulation systems. (PSPFOF 
¶¶ 1-2.)"
1130,6," In their comments, Ponder (CertainTeed), Heffelmire (Guardian), Crall, Robbins, and Walker (MBMA) sought the reversion of 
the filled cavity. (PSPFOF ¶ 21.)"
1130,7," Thermal Design appealed ASHRAE's rejection of its comment because, if basing rejection on ""professional judgment,"" 
ASHRAE must provide a summary rationale for arriving at that judgment, and no rationale was provided in this instance. 
(PSPFOF ¶¶ 51-52.) ASHRAE ultimately denied Thermal Design's appeal. (PSPFOF ¶ 55.) "
1131,8, It is unclear in which meeting Robbins discussed market control.
1131,9," The document received by Thermal Design included a footer, which read ""Provided to Casey Harkins of TDI Ind on 3/23/12 - do 
not distribute without permission by the ASHRAE Manager of Standards."" Thermal Design documents forwarded by Sciarra to 
Lamtec did not include such a warning. (PSPFOF ¶¶ 67-68.) "
1133,10," Because Wisconsin antitrust law follows federal precedents, the court's reasoning regarding the federal antitrust claim 
applies equally to the state antitrust claim. See Conley Publ'g Grp. v. Journal Commc'ns, 2003 WI 119, ¶ 17, 265 Wis. 2d 128, 
665 N.W.2d 879; Lerma v. Univision Commc'ns, 52 F. Supp. 2d 1011, 1015-16 (E.D. Wis. 1999). "
1134,11," In Lawline, the court held the bar associations 11 (non state actors) to be immune from antitrust liability under the Noerr-
Pennington doctrine. Id. at 1383. A discussion of the Noerr-Pennington doctrine will be presented in the next section. However, 
to make matters clear, the bar associations were held to be immune under this theory because the bar associations encouraged 
the adoption of the challenged rules. Lawline, 956 F.2d at 1383. "
1143,12," A review of these exhibits reveals good cause for sealing these two exhibits, as the redacted portions reveal personal 
information relating to the members of ASHRAE."
1143,13," Thermal Design indicates in its motion that it requested to file certain documents under seal pursuant to the Protective Order 
that was entered because various other parties have designated these materials as confidential. However, Thermal Design 
indicates that it does not believe ""the relevant portions of these documents are confidential."" (Dkt. No. 215, ¶ 5.) ASHRAE did 
not file a response opposing Thermal Design's motion. Requesting sealing based upon the Protective Order is insufficient, and 
the motion is being denied because of a failure to establish the requisite ""good cause"" for filing documents under seal. See 
Citizens First Nat'l Bank v. Cincinnati Ins. Co., 178 F.3d 943, 944 (7th Cir. 1999). "
1144,14," The court has reviewed North Carolina State Board of Dental Examiners v. Federal Trade Commission, 717 F.3d 359, 2013 
WL 2367806 (4th Cir. 2013), and concludes that this recent case does not affect the court's decision. First, this court found that 
the state action doctrine did not apply to ASHRAE's conduct because ASHRAE is [*78]  a private entity and was not acting 
pursuant to the direction of the State acting as a sovereign. Thus, Dental Examiners is immaterial in this respect. Second, this 
court found, like the court found in Dental Examiners, that ASHRAE has the capacity to conspire under § 1 because the 
members remain separate economic actors with separate financial interests and thus, any agreement between the members 
deprives the market of an independent center of decision making. Third, the court in Dental Examiners found that substantial 
evidence supported the FTC's conclusion that the Board engaged in concerted action, pointing out that the Board discussed 
teeth-whitening services provided by non-dentists and voted to take action to restrict those services by sending cease-and-desist 
letters (some warning that the sale or use of teeth-whitening products by a non-dentist is a misdemeanor) as well as letters to 
mall operators to stop malls from leasing kiosk space to non-dentist teeth-whitening providers. There was evidence that these 
letters caused manufacturers and distributors of teeth-whitening products used by non-dentist providers to exit or hold off 
entering North Carolina. This kind of direct and circumstantial evidence establishing the Board's coordinated action is simply 
lacking in the instant case. And finally, in Dental Examiners, the Board's concerted action had the effect of eliminating consumer 
choice and increasing prices for teeth-whitening services by ""excluding a lower-cost and popular group of competitors,"" thus 
likely causing significant anticompetitive harms. Id. at *9. As was discussed in the body of this court's decision, ASHRAE's 
conduct did not shut out competition from liner system manufacturers. There is no evidence of increasing prices, Thermal 
Design was still able to compete, and consumers still had the option to choose a liner system over any type of metal building 
insulation assembly. "
1147,1," Specifically, the offer stated, in relevant part, the following: ""Lender may report this Agreement and the terms hereof, including 
any principal forgiveness, to the credit bureaus. I acknowledge that this may have an adverse impact to my credit report 
depending on how the credit bureaus use this information."" (Mot. Ex. A, at 8). We may consider the content of the offer, which is 
attached to Defendant's Motion, under the incorporation by reference doctrine, given that the Complaint refers to the content of 
the offer, and Plaintiff does not dispute its authenticity. Branch v. Tunnell, 14 F.3d 449, 454 (9th Cir. 1994). "
1148,2," For future reference, we note that as to the unfair prong, we adopt the view that an unfair business practice is one ""that 
threatens an incipient violation of an antitrust law, or violates the policy or spirit of one of those laws because its effects are 
comparable to or the same as a violation of the law, or otherwise significantly threatens or harms competition."" See, e.g., 
Christensen v. Synthes USA, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 67036, 2013 WL 1899094, at *3 n.3 (C.D. Cal. May 6, 2013). The Parties 
therefore should not spend pages discussing this issue in the future as they did in this Motion. "

1214,1," Defendant also filed an ex parte application to strike substantial portions of plaintiffs' reply brief, contending that plaintiffs had 
impermissibly introduced new evidence and argument. Much of defendant's ex parte application, however, is a surreply rather 
than an application to strike ""scandalous"" or ""impertinent"" material. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f). The Court DENIES Midland's 
application but exercises its discretion to consider Midland's arguments contained therein."
1214,2," Defendant objects to the use of the Newsome Deposition in this litigation, contending that the evidence is speculative, lacking 
in foundation, and misleading, and not relevant to the instant litigation. This deposition was taken during the Peterman litigation. 
To the extent that Newsome testified to factual matters that are also relevant to the instant dispute, the Court finds that his 
testimony may be considered here."
1214,3," Midland notes that plaintiffs do not contend that this alleged representation was disseminated uniformly to the class as a whole 
and therefore could not serve as the basis for plaintiffs' claims on a classwide basis. The Court agrees. "
1215,4," The ""bonus"" is applied to the initial premium paid by the purchaser to obtain the annuity. For example, a $10,000 investment 
into an annuity providing a 10% bonus would give the purchaser  [*5] an initial ""accumulation value"" of $11,000. See Yanacheak 
Decl. ¶¶ 2-3. "
1216,5," According to Midland's internal data, the 17,929 policies in the class were sold by thousands of different agents to over fifteen 
thousand purchasers. Decl. of Paul Schlitz ¶¶ 10-13."
1216,6," Nor are the sales materials or contracts at issue in this litigation uniform in all respects, according to Midland. Several different 
versions of the brochure and disclosure statement have been created for each class product, even if much of the information 
contained in these materials has remained constant. Opp'n at 7-8."
1216,7, The contracts themselves also disclose the surrender charge and interest adjustment features of the Class Products. 
1219,8," Midland contends that class members were not treated uniformly because the effect of sales commissions and the bonus on 
crediting rates cannot be isolated as to each individual consumer; the effect would vary based on the other inputs into the pricing 
spread. Midland does not dispute, however, that these rates are set to recoup its costs of paying the bonus and sales 
commissions to its agents. The propriety of this practice presents a common issue. "
1220,9," Typicality issues related to the statute of limitations may be more problematic where the class is divided between members 
who would be subject to a potential statute of limitations defense and those would not be. See, e.g., Tait v. BSH Home 
Appliances Corp., 289 F.R.D. 466, 2012 WL 6699247 (C.D. Cal. 2012) (""Plaintiff Tait is not typical of the entire Illinois Class 
because it appears that roughly three-quarters of the Illinois Class bought their Washers less than three years prior to Plaintiffs 
filing their Complaint, and thus most of the Illinois Class would not be subject  [*27] to statute of limitations defense that 
Defendants can raise against Plaintiff Tait.""). Here, because Midland stopped selling six of the seven Class Products before 
March 2006, Midland's potential statute of limitations defense would apply to the vast majority of the class members. See Opp'n 
at 28 (citing Decl. of Samuel J. Park ¶ 5). Plaintiffs would be typical representatives for these absent class members. "
1221,," The sole exception is that Midland stopped selling the Veridian Plus annuity in April 2009. Therefore, it may be necessary for 
plaintiffs to seek a new class representative for those class members to which defendant could not assert any statute of 
limitations defense. The Court may still certify plaintiffs' proposed class in full, ""conditioned upon the substitution of another 
named plaintiff"" for the limited numbers of individuals who bought Veridian Plus annuities within the applicable statute of 
limitations period for plaintiffs' particular claims (three years for fraud claims; four years for breach of contract and UCL claims). 
See Tait, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 183649, 2012 WL 6699247 at *8. But given that the vast majority of class members would be 
subject to this potential defense, and that defendant has not  [*28] voiced an objection along these lines, plaintiffs appear to be 
adequate representatives for the class as a whole. "
1222,10," Midland also characterizes plaintiffs' fraud claims as based on alleged concealment, rather than affirmative 
misrepresentations, a characterization that plaintiffs dispute. Opp'n at 24; Reply at 5, n. 1. Plaintiffs' claims may well be 
grounded in both alleged misrepresentation and concealment of material facts, but determining the proper classification of their 
claims is largely immaterial to the instant motion. The question is whether common issues will predominate, because defendant 
allegedly affirmatively represented the effect of a bonus to the class, and failed to disclose the ""truth"" about this bonus and high 
commissions. See Jordan, 285 F.R.D. at 465 (adopting a presumption of reliance on the basis of alleged, uniform fraudulent 
omissions ). "
1225,11," Midland objects to plaintiffs' references to a variety of evidence from experts in other cases as to how damages may be 
calculated in a case such as this one, arguing that such evidence is irrelevant. Def.'s Ex Parte App. to Strike at 9-11; Def.'s 
Opp'n to Pl.'s Reply Evidence. "
1226,12," Defendant also raises an argument with respect to its statute of limitations' defense to plaintiffs' UCL claims. For the same 
reasons discussed above for plaintiffs' fraud claims, this argument is unavailing. In addition,  [*48] defendant argues in its ex 
parte application that it has been prejudiced by plaintiffs' contention in reply that they seek class certification on all three prongs 
of the UCL, consistent with the allegations in plaintiffs' TAC. Defendant's argument is belied by its own opposition, which 
addresses each of plaintiffs' three theories. "
1228,13," Even if only twenty percent of the class has incurred surrender charges (and a smaller percentage interest adjustments), 
injunctive relief may still be warranted for the class as a whole. All class members are potentially subject to these penalties. "
1229,14," Midland's further contentions, premised upon the statute of limitations, are the same as those addressed previously. "
1237,1," Defendant Genpak argues that Evergreen's claims against it are barred by a liability release. However, we decline to consider 
this issue as the district court did not analyze the question in detail, concluding that Evergreen's § 1 claim against Genpak were 
insufficiently pled in any case. We therefore think it prudent to allow the district court to consider the issue anew on remand. See 
Plymouth Sav. Bank v. I.R.S., 187 F.3d 203, 209 (1st Cir. 1999). "
1239,2," In its opinion dismissing Evergreen's antitrust claim, the district court cited allegations made in the First Amended Complaint 
and memos attached thereto. See, e.g., Evergreen Partnering Grp., Inc. v. Pactiv Corp., 865 F. Supp. 2d 133, 137 (D. Mass. 
2012). However, since HN1[
] ""[a]n amended complaint supersedes the original complaint, and facts that are neither repeated "
1240,," nor otherwise incorporated into the amended complaint no longer bind the pleader,"" InterGen N.V. v. Grina, 344 F.3d 134, 145 
(1st Cir. 2003), we limit our analysis to the allegations made in Evergreen's Second Amended Complaint. "
1244,3," We also note that footnote 4 in Twombly is very broad and suggestive of allegations that may support agreement at the 
pleadings stage -- ""conduct that indicates the sort of restricted freedom of action and sense of obligation that one generally 
associates with agreement"" -- and the Court explicitly rejected a heightened pleading standard in antitrust cases after 
acknowledging that discovery in antitrust cases ""can be expensive."" 550 U.S. at 558; see id. at 569 n.14 (""[W]e do not apply any 
'heightened' pleading standard, nor do we seek to broaden the scope of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9, which can only be 
accomplished 'by the process of amending the Federal Rules, and not by judicial interpretation.'"") (citation omitted); see also 
West Penn Allegheny Health Sys., Inc. v. UPMC, 627 F.3d 85, 98 (3d Cir. 2010) (rejecting district court's  [**35] application of a 
heightened pleading standard in antitrust cases). "
1246,4," Defendants argue that Evergreen's complaint failed to allege any facts that the ACC acted as an independent entity in the 
alleged boycott, and, therefore, it cannot be liable under § 1. They rely on Alvord-Polk, Inc. v. F. Schumacher & Co., 37 F.3d 
996, 1007 (3d Cir. 1994). This argument was not addressed by the district court, but even assuming we adopt the Third Circuit's 
rule regarding trade association liability, Evergreen has sufficiently alleged action by the ACC as an independent entity to survive 
a motion to dismiss. Since the PFPG is a business group within the ACC, it is reasonable to infer that the ACC was aware of the 
PFPG's 2005-2006 meeting. Further, the complaint alleges that the ACC allowed Dart to publish a misleading article on its "
1247,," website and used its publication -- Plastic News -- to  [**44] promote a sham competitor to Evergreen. Finally, the complaint 
alleges that Evergreen reached out to PFPG and the ACC to ""validate its closed-loop program"" as well as seeking funding for its 
California project. When Evergreen's proposal was put before the PFPG's members, who made a group decision to deny 
funding for the project, it was the PFPG, on ACC letterhead, that notified Evergreen. This is sufficient to state a claim that, at a 
minimum, the ACC acquiesced to and/or aided and abetted a trade-restraining agreement actionable under § 1 at this stage. 
See United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., 334 U.S. 131, 161, 68 S. Ct. 915, 92 L. Ed. 1260 (1948) (HN14[

1998)."
1247,5," These factual allegations in Evergreen's complaint include the assertion that virgin resin was competitively priced and that the 
additional ""environmental fee"" was ""specifically structured to be merely a percentage of the cost-savings each school achieved 
by virtue of its participation in the closed-loop program."" "
1253,1," According to Plaintiff, Advanced Micro Devices ""supplies a substantial percentage of the processors incorporated into 
Defendant's computers (including the ones incorporated in the computer Defendant sold  [**14] to Plaintiff)."" SAC ¶ 2. "
1254,2," The acts and practices that Plaintiff challenges  [**20] include: (1) making improper representations regarding the source or 
certification of the goods sold, (2) making improper representations regarding association with or certification by another of the 
goods it sold, (3) representing that its goods have characteristics that they do not have, and (4) representing that its goods are of 
a particular quality when they are of another. See SAC ¶ 48 (citing Cal. Civ. Code §§ 1770(a)(2), 1770(a)(3), 1770(a)(5), 
1770(a)(7)). "
1257,3," Only Plaintiff's CLRA, UCL, and common law fraud claims appear to be predicated on HP's alleged fraudulent omissions. See 
Opp'n at 20. "
1264,1," Having read and considered the papers presented by the parties, the Court finds this matter appropriate  [*3] for disposition 
without a hearing. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 78; Local Rule 7-15. Accordingly, the hearing set for June 24, 2013 at 1:30 p.m. is hereby 
vacated and off calendar. "
1271,1," The defendants and MSD-USA are considered companies controlled by Medtronic, Inc. for purposes of this motion. That 
relationship is denied by the defendants. "
1274,2," With respect to the availability of the Lenox mill after the recall, the plaintiff's counsel represented during oral argument that Dr. 
Chewning's affidavit contains the statement that ""Dr. Chewning [would] prefer to use the Lenox bone mill, but he can't because 
of the recall. His hospital won't let him order it because of potential liability."" (Hr'g Tr. (May 29, 2013) at 26:11-15). That specific 
statement does not appear in either of Dr. Chewning's declarations. "
1278,1," Plaintiffs' Opposition also claims Plaintiff SPA participates in the Advanced Lipid Testing market, but the Complaint does not. 
Compare Opp., ECF No. 55 p. 5 with Compl., ¶¶ 27-42. The Court therefore cannot  [*6] address Plaintiff SPA's claims. "
1285,2," Plaintiffs' citations to Hahn v. Oregon Physicians' Serv., 868 F.2d 1022, 1029 (9th Cir. 1988), and Va. Acad. Of Clinical 
Psychologists v. Blue Shield of Va., 624 F.2d 476 (4th Cir. 1980), do not settle the issue; those decisions considered horizontal 
agreements that constituted group boycotts, which are treated differently under the antitrust law. There is no allegation here 
that the BSC/Quest agreement is a horizontal restraint among competitors to exclude another competitor form the relevant 
market. "
1298,1," The Former Resident in this case is Elisa Zapata, who is deceased. "
1302,2," In Labatt, the Texas Supreme Court disapproved an alternative holding in Kepka that does not affect its preemption analysis. In 
re Labatt Food Service, L.P., 279 S.W.3d 640, 646 (Tex. 2009) (holding that wrongful death claims brought by non-signatories 
are subject to an arbitration agreement if the claims from which they derive would have been subject to the arbitration 
agreement). "
1306,1, A suggestion of death has been filed by Anna Ramirez as the Representative of the Estate of Diana G. Tayles. 
1313,2," The Former Residents are Maria Acosta (Deceased), Mary Jane Esparza, Mary Esther Rodriguez (Deceased), Cecilia Romo, 
Juan Saucedo, and Diana G. Tayles (Suggestion of Death Filed). "
1316,3," In Labatt, the Texas Supreme Court disapproved an alternative holding in Kepka that does not affect its preemption analysis. In 
re Labatt Food Service, L.P., 279 S.W.3d 640, 646 (Tex. 2009) (holding that wrongful death claims brought by non-signatories 
are subject to an arbitration agreement if the claims from which they derive would have been subject to the arbitration 
agreement). "
1322,1," The parties appear to have interpreted this Court's earlier order as requiring allegations of bilateral agreement between 
Defendants in order to demonstrate antitrust injury. Strictly speaking, that is not the case — the earlier order simply recognized 
the Court of Appeals' holding in West Penn that mere unilaterally-lowered reimbursement rates were insufficient to do so. See 
627 F.3d at 103. Be that as it may, Plaintiffs have chosen to argue that Defendants' agreement is the font from which their 
potential injury flows."
1322,2," This would be true even if Defendants had been enjoined from consummating the merger during the pendency of this lawsuit. 
The allegations in Plaintiffs' initial and amended complaints attribute their potential  [*6] harm to the power of the merged entity, 
not Defendants individually. "
1325,1," ""Monopsony power is market power on the buy side of the market. . . . As such, a monopsony is to the buy side of the market 
what a monopoly is to the sell side and is sometimes colloquially called a 'buyer's monopoly.'"" Weyerhaeuser Co. v. Ross-
Simmons Hardwood Lumber Co., Inc., 549 U.S. 312, 321, 127 S. Ct. 1069, 166 L. Ed. 2d 911 (2007). The equation for 
measuring market power in monopsony is a ""mirror image"" of the relationships creating market power in a seller. Todd v. Exxon 
Corp., 275 F.3d 191, 202 (2d Cir. 2001) "
1330,2," Courts have also held that the Phoenix Defendants are entitled to retain premiums on a policy that has been found to have 
been fraudulently procured. PHL Variable Ins. Co. v. Morello Irrevocable Trust, 645 F.3d 965, 970 (8th Cir.2011). "
1331,3," Defendants argue that the allegedly improper COI increases predate plaintiff's acquisition of the Policies.  [*25] COI increases 
were recognized by plaintiff as a risk factor bearing the value of its investment. The publicly available ""Listing Particulars"" issued 
by plaintiff in connection with a security offering involving the Policies states that ""at least one life insurance company publicly 
announced an increase in its cost of insurance policies earlier this year, which creates a meaningful possibility that the cost of 
insurance under one or more Policies may be higher than currently anticipated since such increase may include Policies within 
the Portfolio as well as lead to similar increases by such insurance company or other insurance companies that affect other 
Policies."" However, the Court cannot determine on this motion to dismiss the extent to which plaintiff was aware of the alleged 
COI increases by the Phoenix Defendants prior to acquisition of the Policies."
1331,4," The Connecticut Supreme Court has not yet decided whether a private right of action exists under CUIPA. U.S. Bank Nat. 
Ass'n v. PHL Variable Ins. Co., 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 38768, 2013 WL 791462, *10 n.10 (S.D.N.Y. 2013). However, it is well 
settled that violations of CUIPA may be alleged as a basis of CUTPA. Nazami v. Patrons Mut. Ins. Co., 280 Conn. 619, 625, 910 
A.2d 209 (2006). "
1338,1," Plaintiffs refer to the Confirmation as if it generally represents the ""initial reservation agreements"" they claim to have entered. 
The Court does the same."
1338,2," Plaintiffs' FAC includes a long list of other consumers' reviews of Defendants' services, all reporting experiences similar to Ms. 
McKinnon's and Ms. Tool's. See id. ¶¶ 17-20. "
1353,1," After an AHRN customer selects a real estate agent via NeighborCity, NeighborCity allows the customer to make contact with 
the agent via e-mail or text message without disclosing the customer's personal information. (Countercl. ¶ 10.) The first agent to 
connect with the customer has the ""exclusive opportunity"" to win that customer's business. (Id.) The customer decides whether 
to hire the agent after meeting or going on a property tour. (Id.) AHRN receives compensation by receiving thirty percent  [**5] of 
the local agent's commissions in return for putting the agent in touch with the customer. (Id. ¶¶ 11, 30.)"
1353,2," As the Court stated in its order, ""For the first time, at oral argument, AHRN questioned . . . whether the assignments of certain 
copyrights to RMLS were valid. AHRN also stated, however, that its attacks on the ownership of the copyrights would inform the 
Court little on how it should handle the issues for preliminary injunction. Because AHRN has not briefed these arguments and 
indicated that they were not relevant to the preliminary injunction, the Court will not address them in any detail, beyond stating 
that, at this stage, AHRN has not successfully rebutted RMLS's presumption that it owns the copyrights at issue."" 2012 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 138690, [WL] at *8 n.11. "
1355,3," RMLS does not maintain signed copies or paper records of the individual Subscriber Agreements, but it maintains 
computerized records that indicate whether an agent has accepted the Subscriber Agreement. (Id. ¶ 5.)"
1355,4," The four agents further stated that none of them gave permission to AHRN to reproduce, display, or use any of the 
photographs at issue. (See Anderson Decl. ¶ 5; Ringham Decl. ¶ 6; Worrell Decl. ¶ 6; Olsen Decl. ¶ 6.)"
1355,5," The Participant Agreement also stated that the broker ""may make unfettered and unrestricted use of the [copyrighted item] in 
perpetuity."" (Id.)"
1355,6," In addition, RMLS states that it likely has a copyright registration for the seventy-seven photographs. "
1356,7," According to AHRN, the effort to restrict AHRN's participation in the market for real estate information and services has been 
coordinated, at least in part, and supported by the NAR, a trade association that, on information and belief, establishes and 
enforces policies for its individual members and promulgates rules governing the conduct of NAR-member MLSs – including 
RMLS. (Id. ¶ 32.)"
1356,8," At the 2012 Council of MLS meeting in Boston, AHRN alleges that a speaker told the attendees that it would be ""extremely 
burdensome"" if each ""MLS must recognize every copyright element in the database to register."" (Id. ¶ 43.)"
1356,9," In 2011, Tarasoft was acquired by CoreLogic, which, on AHRN's information and belief, continues to develop and maintain 
software for RMLS and other MLSs around the country. (Id. ¶ 53.) "
1357,10," AHRN responded to each of these MLS letters with an offer to purchase a license to the disputed material. (Id. ¶ 35.) The 
MLSs refused to discuss a licensing agreement. (Id. ¶ 36.) "
1358,11," Although the complaint did not include the text of the entire e-mail, the Court may consider the e-mail in its entirety because it 
may consider material necessarily  [**20] embraced by the complaint on a motion to dismiss. See Enervations, Inc. v. Minn. 
Mining and Mfg. Co., 380 F.3d 1066, 1069 (8th Cir. 2004)."
1358,12," In addition, RMLS submitted a copy of the Subscriber Agreement that each of the four agents electronically signed, agreeing 
to assign their copyrights to their brokers. At oral argument, AHRN disputed that electronic signatures were sufficient to confer 
an interest in the copyrights. See 17 U.S.C. § 204(a). HN3[
] The Court finds that electronic signatures can be sufficient to 
transfer a copyright. See Metro. Reg'l Info. Sys., Inc. v. Am. Home Realty Network, Inc., 904 F. Supp. 2d 530, 2012 WL 
5503513, at *5-6 (D. Md. 2012). Here, reviewing the record as a whole, the Court finds that there is sufficient evidence that the 
agents transferred their copyrights to their brokers. "
1359,13," For example, it is unclear if the Michael C. Olsen who allegedly signed the agreement with AHRN is the same person who 
took the Keller Williams photographs that are subject to this contempt motion."
1359,14," RMLS argues that the alleged agreements between AHRN and these brokers do not give AHRN permission to use the 
brokers' photographs because they merely allow use of the brokers' ""name[s] and information regarding [the brokers'] listings."" 
According to RMLS, this language only allows AHRN to display basic factual information about listings and does not allow the 
display of photographs. The Court declines to interpret this contractual language at this time, other than to hold that the 
language does not unambiguously apply only to basic factual information."
1359,15," It appears that RE/MAX may have now terminated any agreement it had with AHRN through a letter dated January 8, 2013. 
Because the motion for contempt was filed on November 15, 2012, the Court will not consider the January 8 letter for purposes 
of this motion."
1359,16," Copyright protection exists once a work is fixed in a tangible form of expression. 17 U.S.C. § 102(a). Neither publication nor 
registration is required to secure a copyright. Id. § 408."
1359,17," The Court also did not limit the order to the publication of photographs that contained a watermark, although the Court noted 
that RMLS had indicated that it placed a watermark on all copyrighted photographs. See 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 138690, [WL] at 
*2 n.3. "
1361,18," As the Court stated above, the Court's order was not limited to photographs containing a watermark. However, in determining 
the amount of sanctions, the Court has considered that a number of the photographs that AHRN displayed did not contain a 
watermark and that AHRN could have possibly been under the false impression that RMLS did not possess a copyright to these 
photographs. Accordingly, the Court has not imposed sanctions for the publication of any of the photographs without 
watermarks."
1361,19," RMLS argues that AHRN is prohibited from displaying photographs for which other parties hold copyrights and therefore must 
not display any photographs on NorthstarMLS without permission from a copyright holder. However, RMLS also admits that it 
has no standing to protect copyrighted images that it does not own. Because this Court's order extends only to prohibiting AHRN 
from displaying copyrights owned by RMLS, RMLS must make clear which copyrights on NorthstarMLS are in fact owned by 
RMLS."
1361,20," The exception to this dictate is if AHRN obtains legal permission from a copyright holder, such as a member-broker of RMLS 
that owns a partial interest in a copyright, to display a photograph. "
1362,21," RMLS argues that AHRN's offer  [**37] to purchase licenses from MLSs after receiving cease and desist letters amounted to 
an offer to settle the parties' developing dispute and therefore that the failure to grant these licenses is enveloped in the Noerr-
Pennington doctrine. "
1363,22," See, e.g., Sunergy Cmtys., Inc. v. Aristek Props., Ltd., 535 F. Supp. 1327, 1331 (D. Colo. 1982); see also In re Relafen 
Antitrust Litig., 346 F. Supp. 2d 349, 362 (D. Mass. 2004)."
1363,23, This argument was not presented to the Court prior to its entry of the preliminary injunction order. 
1364,24," RMLS argues that Mosey's e-mail is irrelevant because it was sent in December 2011, after RMLS (and other MLSs) had sent 
a cease and desist letter to AHRN. However, the e-mail could contemplate that MLSs have acted in concert before, because "
1365,," Mosey states, ""If I were Mr. Cardella, I'd be thinking that we (the offended parties) are unconnected, unserious and more noise 
than threat."" Furthermore, this e-mail took place before the NAR meeting that funded this action and other legal actions and 
adopted allegedly exclusionary rules. Accordingly, the Court finds at this stage that the allegations regarding Mosey's e-mail 
could raise a suggestion of an agreement."
1365,25," HN19[
] To be capable of conspiring under § 1, entities must be ""separate economic actors pursuing separate economic interests."" See Am. Needle, 130 S. Ct. at 2212, 2215 (internal quotation marks omitted); (Countercl. ¶ 14). Courts have 
recognized that MLSs and their member-brokers can meet this standard and thus form a conspiracy. See, e.g., Robertson v. 
Sea Pines Real Estate Cos., 679 F.3d 278, 285-86 (4th Cir. 2012). AHRN has sufficiently alleged that the broker-members of 
RMLS are ""separate economic actors pursuing separate economic interests"" sufficient to potentially subject  [**48] agreements 
between RMLS and its member-brokers to § 1. "
1367,26," RMLS argues that the per se rule cannot apply because there is no horizontal agreement among direct competitors. See 
Brookins, 219 F.3d at 852 n.3. As support, RMLS argues that MLSs, which operate in different geographical areas, are not 
competitors of one another. See NYNEX Corp., 525 U.S. at 135 (""[P]recedent limits the per se rule in the boycott context to 
cases involving horizontal agreements among direct competitors.""). The Court finds that it is premature to determine the nature 
of the relationship among the alleged co-conspirators and whether they are in fact competitors. Furthermore, AHRN has also 
alleged a conspiracy among member-brokers and RMLS, who may be competitors. "
1368,27," AHRN alleges that dual-side agency home sales are promoted in two main ways. First, when potential customers find a 
property on a listing broker's website, that broker can direct the customers to its own listing agent and divert them away from an 
independent agent. Second, RMLS sets restrictions on when third parties can access its data feeds, and will not allow access to 
third parties who  [**58] send customers to real estate agents not affiliated with the listing broker. "
1373,1," On the docket sheet, the complaint is designated a ""PRO SE COMPLAINT Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983."""
1373,2," In one of her early filings in this case, Rajapakse insisted that the defendants ""were served with a copy of the [original] 
 [*3] complaint by hand on the date it was filed,"" (see D.E. 12 at 4), but, contrarily, she states in a later filing that her complaint 
""has not been served to the original parties,"" (see D.E. 42 at 2). MLGW maintains that it has never been served with a copy of 
the original complaint. (See D.E. 11-1 at 4.)"
1373,3," Later in the complaint, Rajapakse alleges that the balance on her bill was $1,735.00. (See Compl., D.E. 1 at 4.) "
1374,4," In an order dated October 3, 2012, the presiding district judge ruled that Rajapakse could not prosecute this case as a class 
action ""or otherwise on behalf of other similarly situated individuals."" (Order Construing and Denying Motion for Class 
Certification, D.E. 5 at 2.) As such, in construing Rajapakse's prayer for relief here, the court has ignored any and all portions 
wherein Rajapakse seeks relief for individuals other than herself. "
1376,5," Also discussed at the status conference were the nature and effect of MLGW's appearance in the case despite its (MLGW's) 
position that it had not been properly served with process. It was determined that MLGW's appearance was of a ""limited"" nature, 
as opposed to being a ""general appearance,"" and that neither MLGW nor any of the other defendants were required to answer 
any pleadings ""due to summons not being issued."" (See D.E. 55.)"
1376,6," Strictly speaking, this rule applies only ""if the pleading is one to which a responsive pleading  [*18] is required."" See Fed. R. 
Civ. P. 15(a)(1)(B). As stated above, the court determined in the April 26, 2013 status conference that the defendants were not 
required to respond to any pleadings in this case as they had not yet been served with process. It is undisputed that the 
defendants were served with a copy of the document filed as Docket Entry 6. The original complaint, on the other hand, was at 
best only hand delivered to the defendants. Nonetheless, for purposes solely of construing Rajapakse's right to amend her 
complaint here, the court will consider the original complaint to have been properly served on the defendants (even though in 
actuality it was only hand delivered to them) and will thereby regard Rajapakse's collective First Amended Complaint, a major "
1377,," portion of which is the original complaint, as a pleading ""to which a responsive pleading is required"" within the meaning of Rule 
15(a)(1)(B)."
1377,7," Although MLGW's October 29, 2012 motion to dismiss does not state that it is brought pursuant to any Federal Rule of Civil 
Procedure, it is well established that dismissal of a case for lack of standing is a dismissal under Rule 12(b)(1) for lack of 
subject-matter jurisdiction. See  [*19] Hooker v. Sasser, 893 F. Supp. 764, 768 n.1 (M.D. Tenn. 1995). As such, the motion to 
dismiss qualifies under Rule 15(a)(1)(B). "
1379,8," In a different context, specifically in the course of laying out Rajapakse's antitrust claims, the Second Amended Complaint cites 
""Constitution Amendment 9."" The court does not regard this as an attempt to name a constitutional home for Rajapakse's 
section 1983 claim. Regardless, the Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which states ""The enumeration in the 
Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people,"" is ""not a vehicle for 
bringing civil rights claims"" and therefore will not support a claim under section 1983. Richardson v. Sewerage & Water Bd., Civil 
A. No. 95-3033, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7492, 1996 WL 288275, at *2 (E.D. La. May 30, 1996); see also Rynn v. Jaffe, 457 F. 
Supp. 2d 22, 26 (D.D.C. 2006); Coleman v. Parra, 163 F. Supp. 2d 876, 886 (S.D. Ohio 2000)."
1379,9," It appears that at the time Rajapakse filed the original complaint as well as when she filed her First Amended Complaint, she 
was continuing to receive utility services from MLGW despite the ongoing billing dispute.  [*27] However, in the Second 
Amended Complaint, Rajapakse states that on October 17, 2012, her utility services were disconnected, presumably for 
nonpayment, and that MLGW and Cole have placed a ""theft hold"" on her account ""barring her from . . . having her services 
restored."" "
1380,10," The court cannot decipher from Rajapakse's Second Amended Complaint any section 1983 claims arising under any theory of 
deprivation other than the termination of her utility services. If Rajapakse wished to bring any such claim, she could and should 
have spelled it out in her complaint and cited the applicable constitutional provision or federal statute. "
1381,11," Technically, it is unnecessary for the court to screen Rajapakse's state-law claims as they should be dismissed sua sponte for 
lack of subject-matter jurisdiction because there is no diversity of citizenship and the court has recommended dismissal of all of 
the federal claims in this case. "
1382,12," T.C.A. § 65-23-103 was repealed during the most recent legislative session, which repeal became effective July 1, 2013. See 
ch. 211, 2013 Tenn. Pub. Acts. "
1383,13," The Tennessee Supreme Court has recognized that ""intentional misrepresentation"" and ""fraudulent misrepresentation"" require 
the same elements, which overlap with the elements of a common-law fraud claim. See Hodge v. Craig, 382 S.W.3d 325, 342 
n.28 (Tenn. 2012). In fact, the court has stated that ""'intentional misrepresentation,' 'fraudulent misrepresentation,' and 'fraud' are 
different names for the same cause of action."" Id. "
1385,1, The parties have consented to the jurisdiction of a United States Magistrate Judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(c). 
1386,2," For the purposes of the instant motion, the Court assumes the factual allegations in Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint to be 
true. "
1392,3," Plaintiff also suggests that in an earlier motion to dismiss, GTL implied there was a written contract (of which Plaintiff was 
unaware) prior to the November 2011 Terms and Conditions. Plaintiff states that to the extent GTL now concedes there is no 
such written agreement, it should be permitted to amend its complaint to allege that the breach of contract in Claim Three began 
in November 2011. "
1395,4," In particular, GTL contends the following limitation periods apply to Plaintiff's claims: four years for breach of a written contract 
 [*37] (Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 337); two years for breach of an oral or implied contract (id. at § 1339); three years for a false 
advertising claim under California Business & Professions Code §§ 17500, et seq. (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 338(a)); four years for 
a claim under Section 17200 (Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 17208); two years for claims of intentional or negligent interference with 
prospective economic advantage (Reudy v. Clear Channel Outdoors, Inc., 693 F. Supp. 2d 1091, 1121 (N.D. Cal. 2010); Cal. 
Civ. Proc. Code § 339(1)); two years for a general negligence claim (Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 335.1); and two years for violations 
of the Federal Communications Act (47 U.S.C. § 415(b))."
1395,5," The Court notes that Plaintiff does not contend that any of her claims were equitably tolled prior to the filing of the complaint, on 
February 8, 2013. Therefore, the relevant cut-off dates for Plaintiff's claims are as follows: February 8, 2009 as to Claims One 
and Three (breach of written contract claims), and Claim Five (UCL claim); February 8, 2010 as to Claim Four (false advertising 
claim); and February 8, 2011 as to the remaining claims. "
1397,6," The Court notes that GTL did not challenge the sufficiency of Plaintiff's allegations as to the existence of an implied contract on 
any ground other than the fact that Plaintiff asserted essentially the same claims on the basis of written contracts. Whether 
Plaintiff alleged sufficient facts to establish the existence of an implied contract is a separate question. California law recognizes 
two varieties of implied contract: those that are implied in law under the equitable theory that a contract to pay for services 
rendered is implied by law for reasons of justice and those that are implied in fact based on actions by the parties evincing an 
intent to create a binding contract."" Design Data Corp. v. Unigate Enterprise, Inc., 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12060, 2013 WL 
360542, at *5 (N.D.Cal., Jan. 29, 2013) (citing Hedging Concepts, Inc. v. First Alliance Mortgage Co., 41 Cal.App.4th 1410, 
1419, 49 Cal. Rptr. 2d 191, (1996);  [*45] Weitzenkorn v. Lesser, 40 Cal.2d 778, 794, 256 P.2d 947 (1953)). An implied in law 
contract is a quantum meruit claim under which the plaintiff may recover the value of the benefit conferred. Id. Although Out Now 
has not specified which theory its claim is based upon, its request for damages on Claim Two indicates that it is asserting the 
claim on the basis of an agreement that is implied in fact."
1397,7," The Court rejects Out Now's suggestion that the alleged interruptions in services amounted to ""termination"" within the meaning 
of the Terms and Conditions as there is no allegation that GTL ever formally terminated service to Out Now."
1397,8," Out Now implicitly concedes that its false advertising claim fails to the extent it purports to go beyond the four documents that 
are explicitly identified in the complaint. "
1398,9," Because Plaintiff fails to state a claim  [*50] under the UCL, the Court need not reach GTL's assertion that Plaintiff seeks the 
wrong remedy on this claim. "
1399,10," The Court notes that Out Now did not respond to GTL's argument that under the Ninth Circuit's decision in the North Country 
case, Out Now cannot assert a claim under the FCA because there is no private right of action under the circumstances here. "
1401,11," GTL also contends Plaintiff's interference claims fail because, to the extent  [*61] Plaintiff's other claims fail, Plaintiff has not 
alleged any conduct that is ""independently wrongful."" Out Now does not dispute that it must establish that the conduct that is the 
basis for these claims must be ""independently wrongful,"" but contends it has met this requirement based on the other claims 
asserted in its FAC. The Court need not reach this issue. "
1405,1," The other two cases are State of Texas, et al. v. Hachette Book Group, Inc., et al., 12 Civ. 6625  [**3] (DLC), in which forty-nine 
states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Territories and Possessions the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana 
Islands, Guam, and American Samoa, bringing claims as parens patriae, have settled their claims against Hachette, 
HarperCollins, and Simon & Schuster (""Settlement Action""); and In re: Electronic Books Antitrust Litigation, 859 F. Supp. 2d 671 
(DLC), in which class action plaintiffs bring claims for damages (""Class Action"")."
1405,2," The Court's procedures for non-jury proceedings were discussed in detail at conferences held on June 22 and October 26, 
2012, and May 8, 2013. As the parties were informed, the Court prepared a draft opinion in advance of the bench trial based on 
the witness affidavits and other documents submitted with the pretrial order and the arguments of counsel in their trial 
memoranda. At trial, the affiants swore to the truth of the contents of their affidavits and were tendered for cross and redirect 
examination, and the other trial evidence was formally received. The parties  [**5] understood that the Court's final findings of 
fact and conclusions of law would incorporate all of this evidence. Consistent with these procedures, and with the expectation 
that the Court had already prepared a draft opinion, the parties jointly asked the Court for its preliminary views on the merits at 
the final pretrial conference held on May 23, 2013. "
1406,3," Penguin settled these actions on the eve of trial and therefore the affidavit constituting the direct testimony of Shanks, which 
had been submitted with the Joint Pretrial Order, was not offered at trial. "
1408,4," Trade books consist of general interest fiction and non-fiction books. They are to be distinguished from ""non-trade"" books such 
as academic textbooks, reference materials, and other texts."
1408,5," Titles from the Bix Six publishers accounted for over 90% of all U.S. NYT Bestseller book sales in 2010. Random House is the 
largest of the Big Six, followed, in descending order of size, by Penguin, Simon & Schuster, HarperCollins, Hachette, and 
Macmillan. When it comes to e-books, the largest of the Big Six in early 2010 was Penguin, followed in descending order by 
Random House, HarperCollins, Hachette, S&S, and Macmillan."
1408,6," The Nook was released two years later, in November of 2009, offering some competition to Amazon. The iPad was released in 
April 2010."
1408,7," At present, the largest U.S. retailers of trade e-books include Apple, and non-parties Amazon, Barnes & Noble, Google, Kobo 
Inc., and Sony Corporation."
1408,8," In fact, as described below, Amazon announced a new initiative in January 2010 that would assist authors in self-publishing 
through Amazon on the Kindle Digital Platform. "
1409,9," Among other strategies that two or more of the Publishers discussed with each other were retail  [**18] price maintenance, 
mandatory minimum advertised pricing, and a joint venture to sell e-books. "
1410,10," Publishers had traditionally delayed the release of paperback versions of hardcover books. This practice is known  [**23] as 
windowing. While the delayed release of some e-book titles, particularly those of popular New Releases, is more technically 
known as withholding, many in the publishing industry also called it windowing, and that term will also be used in this Opinion to 
refer to the delayed release of e-books as a strategy employed by the Publisher Defendants to pressure Amazon to lift its e-book 
prices. "
1411,11," As  [**27] it turned out, Macmillan never implemented this policy. "
1412,12," Cue attributed the Publishers' hatred of Amazon to Amazon ""leveraging [its] force in physical [books] to force [the Publishers] 
into bad deals"" in e-books. "
1413,13," The record does not reveal when Apple began to develop the software for the iBookstore, but it is clear that Apple was 
intensely engaged in that development throughout this two month window."
1413,14," The telephone calls among the Publisher Defendants during the period of their negotiations with Apple represented a 
departure from the ordinary pattern of calls among them. By contrast, there was only one telephone call made between these 
CEOs during the week prior to Apple's first contact with the Publishers on December 8."
1413,15," Some months earlier, Apple had considered proposing to Amazon that they simply divide the e-market for books and music, 
with iTunes acting as ""an ebook reseller exclusive to Amazon and Amazon becom[ing] an audio/video iTunes reseller exclusive 
to Apple."" "
1414,16," Hachette's Thomas had spoken to a HarperCollins executive on December 10, in advance of their meetings with Apple, 
regarding exploring agency as an alternative business model. "
1415,17," On December 15, Hachette's Young spoke to S&S's Reidy by telephone prior to his meeting with Cue. On December 16, 
Reidy called Young just minutes after her meeting with Cue had ended. The next day, the two exchanged three calls. "
1416,18," Sargent's father, John Turner Sargent, Sr., was the President and CEO of the Doubleday & Company publishing house from 
1963 to 1978, and led the company's expansion into an industry giant. "
1417,19," Cue asserted at trial that ""solves Amazon issue"" referred to pricing e-books in the iBookstore above $9.99, and was not a 
reference to raising prices across the industry or eliminating Amazon's ability to set prices. Indeed, Cue protested  [**50] at trial 
that, throughout its negotiations with the Publisher Defendants, Apple was concerned only with the pricing that would prevail in 
the iBookstore and sought only to ""fix"" Amazon's pricing or ""solve the Amazon issue"" in its own e-bookstore. In this and several 
other aspects of Cue's testimony, regrettably, he was not credible. The documentary record and the commercial context of the 
negotiations leave room for no other conclusion. Apple's pitch to the Publishers was -- from beginning to end -- a vision for a new 
industry-wide price schedule. Any other course would have left the Publishers vulnerable to Amazon's pricing strategies and 
would have forced Apple to compete on price. Accordingly, Cue's repeated assertion at trial that his sole ""focus"" was on thinking 
about the agency deals and their effects ""from an Apple point of view,"" cannot be taken at face value. As a savvy negotiator he 
knew how to place himself in the Publishers' shoes, understand their interests, and appeal to their concerns, as he eventually 
admitted toward the end of his testimony. Cue recognized that the Publishers were consumed first and foremost by a desire to 
eliminate Amazon's $9.99 price for e-books  [**51] across the market. His colleagues, including Saul, acknowledged that they 
understood at the time that Apple could not solve the Publisher's problem with $9.99 if the Publishers left Amazon on wholesale. 
Thus, Cue and his team found a way to solve the ""Amazon problem"" for the Publishers; not just ""as to Apple,"" but industry-wide. "
1418,20," Cue sent emails to Macmillan, S&S, Random House, and Hachette on January 4. Cue's emails to Penguin and HarperCollins 
were sent on January 5."
1418,21," For reasons unknown, Cue sent two emails to Macmillan, one with each greeting. "
1419,22," Cue's words are captured in a colleague's memorandum. At trial, Cue denied that he had actually spoken in those terms."
1419,23," Apple takes the position that Cue's explanation that it couldn't ""legally force"" the Publishers to place all of their e-tailers on an 
agency contract is not a reference to the lawfulness of such a requirement, but is instead a reference to Apple's skepticism that it 
could legally enforce the clause against any Publisher who reneged on its commitment. It is unnecessary to resolve this 
ambiguity."
1419,24," A great deal of time was spent at trial trying to understand a series of five emails drafted by Jobs on January 14. Cue wanted 
Jobs's approval for higher price caps, and Jobs's emails show that he was quite concerned about the profitability of the 
iBookstore. Jobs's final email in the chain indicates that the Publishers need to ""move Amazon to the agent model too for new 
releases for the first year. If they don't, I'm not sure we can be competitive."" The e-mails were addressed to Cue and he denies 
ever receiving any of them, including the last in the series."
1419,25, The day and date commitment required Publishers to give Apple e-books on the same date they released physical books. 
1421,26," The word ""competitive"" in this and many other contexts at the trial means the opposite of competition. It means the eradication 
of retail price competition."
1421,27," Macmillan also identified that the antitrust risk of signing the agency agreement with the MFN could be ""huge."" "
1422,28," Although Cue attempted to deny this fact at trial, at his deposition Cue admitted that the Publisher Defendants generally 
""accepted"" the MFN, and although the term was negotiated, Cue never felt it was discussed ""in [the] completely material way of 
saying, no, we're not doing that."" Instead, the conversations were focused mainly on ""trying to create loopholes or exceptions to 
it."""
1422,29," The January 4 term sheet had set a price cap at $14.99 for any book with a hardcover list price above $35, and $12.99 for any 
hardcover book listed below $35. The Draft Agreement, by contrast, set the demarcation between $12.99 and $14.99 at $30, 
allowing for higher e-book prices in relation to a title's hardcover list price."
1422,30," Sensitive to the fact that the table looked like an Apple retail price list, Moerer clarified in a follow-up email to Shanks that the 
prices in the table's final column designating the ""iTunes eBook Retail Price"" are the ""top price tier we've proposed"" and that ""[i]n 
the agency model, Penguin would set retail prices at its sole discretion, at this price or any lower price, with Apple acting as your 
agent."" "
1423,31," The Amazon price for e-books, by contrast, was always lower than its retail price for a title's corresponding physical book. "
1425,32," Cue's  [**71] January 16 offer kept the price caps for NYT Bestsellers at the caps listed for all New Releases in the Draft 
Agreement."
1425,33," Through a process known as translation, the prices for digital books are automatically set according to a predetermined 
relationship to the prices of their physical counterparts. "
1426,34," Cue wanted to be sure he had the Agreements in place early enough so that Jobs could finalize his presentation introducing 
the iBookstore during the Launch."
1426,35," While Murray chose to describe the price increases as related to e-books ""enhanced"" with special features, in fact the price 
increases implemented through the Apple Agreements applied to all e-books. "
1427,36," Apple has suggested that Amazon was less opposed to the agency model than the evidence shows. It points to a single 
brainstorming session between two Amazon employees in early 2009, in which they tried to come up with ideas to mollify the 
Publishers. The two employees pondered whether the Publishers would agree to accept a flat percentage of the retail price for 
e-books and quickly dismissed the idea since it would mean a significant loss of revenue for the Publishers. This was not a 
discussion of the agency model; there  [**78] was no discussion about Amazon ceding control over the retail price. There is 
simply no credible evidence that Amazon moved willingly to the agency model in 2010. On January 31, 2010, after the Publisher 
Defendants executed the Agreements, these two individuals expressed astonishment that Publishers had agreed to a deal that 
resulted in a significant loss of revenue for them."
1427,37," In internal emails that morning, HarperCollins executives explained that a ""big win of the Agency model is that by us setting 
price we can protect the value of our hard covers."" "
1428,38," Neither Sargent nor Cue was credible during the trial when they denied that Cue had explained at dinner that Macmillan was 
required to put Amazon on the agency model. Sargent protested that he could not remember the conversation, even though his 
email on the following day referred to ""the single large issue"" that might lead Macmillan to abandon its negotiations with Apple. 
Cue explained in his deposition that the biggest issues during his negotiations with Macmillan were the MFN and price tiers, and 
that he thought the discussion  [**82] at dinner had been about pricing tiers; then at trial explained that he now remembered that 
they had discussed one-off promotions. Cue's contemporaneous notes, however, indicate that the core issue in dispute with 
Macmillan was, in fact, the MFN and its implications. In an email to Jobs on the evening of January 21, just hours after sending 
his email to Sargent, Cue reported that ""[a]fter a long afternoon with their general counsel, we are in agreement on the terms"" 
with Macmillan, ""but the CEO and GC have legal concerns over the price matching."""
1428,39," While Murray was fully supportive of the requirement that all e-tailers be moved to an agency model, as described below, he 
remained unhappy over the size of Apple's commission and the existence of price caps."
1428,40," Amazon had reached out to Penguin during that period, but Penguin had not responded. "
1429,41," While many of these calls were simply efforts to reach the other person, those efforts and the conversations that occurred 
during some of them reflect the intensity of the communications in this period."
1429,42," At this stage, it was Cue's judgment that Random House would wait until after the Launch to make a decision whether to 
convert to the agency model. Cue relayed Random House's email describing its ""excitement"" about Apple entering the market 
and ""building a bookstore"", but expressing several reservations about Apple's terms."
1429,43," The ""new release"" period would be set in the final Agreements at seven months. "
1430,44," Jobs and Cue had met James Murdoch for the first time on January 14, when representatives from News Corp had visited 
Apple's Cupertino headquarters to discuss a broad range of mutual business interests. "
1431,45," Jobs's reference to $9 in revenue is a reference to the 70% of a $12.99 e-book price that a Publisher would receive under 
Apple's agency Agreement. "
1432,46," Grandinetti responded that he did not understand why Penguin was ""working so hard to have [Amazon send it] less money on 
each sale  [**98] while at the same time, reducing total sales and frustrating us."""
1432,47," Cue admitted at trial that Apple ""expected"" each of the Publisher Defendants to demand that Amazon move to an agency 
model, but denied actually ""knowing"" that they would. This testimony was not credible, for many reasons. Cue's denial of prior 
knowledge of Sargent's trip to Amazon was particularly brazen given the January 24 email in which Sargent explained his 
inability to attend the Launch because he would be traveling to Seattle, Jobs's comment to his biographer on January 28 -- the 
day of Sargent's meeting with Amazon -- that the Publisher Defendants ""went to Amazon and said, 'You're going to sign an 
agency contract or we're not going to give you the books,'"" a January 30 email exchange between Saul and Cue monitoring 
news about Amazon's decision to remove Macmillan's buy buttons and wondering whether Cue had ""talk[ed] with [J]on"" Sargent 
and a January 31 email in which Sargent reported to Cue on the trip."
1432,48," To the public's delight, Jobs described this transition as ""like a secret passageway."" "
1433,49," Conscious that he should not admit the truth, Sargent disingenuously added: ""Interesting in that we did the Apple deal with no 
contact with other publishers, yet when Jobs announced he had 5 on the agency plan things were clear."""
1433,50," The next day, Nourry wrote  [**104] a similar email to Sargent's superior, Stefan von Holtzbrinck, assuring him that he ""very 
much appreciate[s] what MacMillan is doing"" and he can ""[b]e sure others will enter the battle field!"" "
1434,51," The subject line of the email was ""Now it must really hurt . . .""."
1434,52," While Cue denied at trial that their conversation was about the Macmillan negotiations with Amazon, his denial was not 
credible. Macmillan had executed its Agreement with Apple a week earlier; the only final agency terms still under discussion 
were with Amazon. "
1435,53," At trial, Moerer at first denied that he had watched the prices of the Publisher Defendants' e-books on Amazon or had noticed 
that they had increased to the price caps. As a director of iTunes for Apple, this was not credible, and Apple witnesses, included 
Moerer, eventually came to admit that they did track these price increases as they were occurring. "
1436,54," The relationship between the price of e-books and their hardcover counterpart is a complex topic that was only tangentially 
explored at trial. Apple conceded, however, that it had not been Amazon's policy to price e-books above their hardcover version, 
but that the Publishers who adopted an agency model for distribution of their e-books did not always follow that practice. There 
is evidence that, with the adoption of the agency model, as many as 20% of trade e-books became more expensive for 
consumers than their physical counterpart. "
1437,55," By contrast, in this study non-party publishers' sales increased 5.4% in the same period."
1437,56," Apple argued at trial that the decline in sales of the Publisher Defendants' e-books compared to those sold by Random House 
was attributable to Amazon's promotion of Random House books during the time Random House remained on a wholesale 
model of distribution. Apple did not offer persuasive evidence, however, that the loss in sales was substantially due to anything 
other than the fact that Amazon continued to price many Random House New Releases at $9.99 while the Publisher Defendants 
raised the prices of their e-books substantially higher. "
1438,57," Dr. Ashenfelter calculated an increase in Random House's prices for e-books of 18.3% on average, and a decrease in its unit 
sales of e-books of 16.7%. "
1442,58," During summation Apple chose not to concede that the plaintiffs had proven at trial that the Publisher Defendants engaged in 
a horizontal price fixing conspiracy. Apple did not expend an effort, however, to argue that such a conspiracy did not exist or that 
the evidence was insufficient to find that it existed. Apple confined its argument to its purported lack of knowledge that the 
Publisher Defendants were conspiring with each other. "
1444,59," Apple has contended that the existence of any conversations among the Publisher Defendants CEOs during their negotiations 
with Apple is neither unusual nor incriminating. This is not the occasion to describe the metes and bounds of lawful 
communication among competitors when they are engaged in simultaneous negotiations with either a common supplier or a 
shared distributor. Instead, the Court focuses  [**140] here on the ways in which the Publisher Defendants' frequent discussions 
are relevant to this Opinion, including that the Publisher Defendants' denials at trial that they discussed the Apple Agreement 
with one another in those communications, or that those conversations occurred at all, in the face of overwhelming evidence to 
the contrary, strongly supports a finding of consciousness of guilt. They knew they were coordinating their efforts to raise the e-
book prices and jointly confront Amazon, and have tried to hide that fact. Moreover, the pattern of their coordination in meetings 
and telephone calls, and their expectation that they would not compete on price -- all of which was apparently well established 
before Apple reached out to them but continued throughout their negotiations with Apple -- serves as strong evidence of this 
conspiracy."
1444,60, Plaintiffs have defined the relevant market as trade e-books in the United States; Apple does not dispute that characterization.
1444,61," The testimony by Apple's experts that the prices of e-books generally, including self-published e-books, decreased on average 
in the years following the introduction of the iBookstore, does not affect this conclusion.  [**143] The Apple experts did not offer 
any scientifically sound analysis of the cause for this purported price decline or seek to control for the factors that may have led 
to it. "
1445,62," In its pretrial memorandum of law, Apple's defense focused almost exclusively on Monsanto's ""tends to exclude"" standard and 
its contention that Plaintiffs' evidence is insufficient to exclude the possibility of independent action. This remains Apple's chief 
argument in its defense. "
1448,63," Apple uses the term ""competitive"" to convey that it wanted its prices to be the lowest in the marketplace, not to convey that it 
wanted prices arrived at through the process of competition. "
1449,64," Apple argued at trial that the MFN gave it more protection against price discrimination by Publishers than the requirement that 
the Publishers move all retailers to an agency arrangement. That is so as a theoretical matter, but there is no basis to find based "
1450,," on the trial record that Apple ever had reason to fear that the Publishers would use their power over retail pricing to lower prices 
anywhere. Instead, the evidence is that Apple feared retail price competition with Amazon. Apple preferred to compete with 
Amazon on the strength of its device rather than through price wars."
1450,65," Apple argued in summation, relying again on the Monsanto  [**163] decision, that if the MFN had both illegal and legal 
purposes, then the existence of a lawful purpose would prevent a finding of liability. For the reasons described above, this 
argument misreads both the law and the record evidence. "
1451,66," This Opinion has already described several instances in which testimony given by Cue and Sargent was unreliable. Other 
witnesses who were noteworthy for their lack of credibility included Moerer, Saul, and Reidy. Their demeanor changed 
dramatically depending on whether Apple or the Plaintiffs were questioning them; they were adamant in denials until confronted 
with documents or their prior deposition testimony; instead of answering questions in a straightforward manner, they would pick 
apart the question and answer it narrowly or avoid answering it altogether. Thus,  [**168] the findings in this Opinion are 
informed by the documentary record, the circumstantial evidence, including an understanding of the competitive landscape in 
which these events were unfolding, and that portion of each witness' testimony that appeared reliable and credible. "
1452,67," While admitting that very few e-books were actually withheld from Amazon by the four Publishers, Apple's Cue observed at 
trial that what mattered was which books were withheld, not how many. "
1453,68," The record is equivocal on whether Apple itself desired higher e-book prices than those offered at Amazon. It is unequivocal 
though that Apple embraced higher prices so convincingly that the Publishers believed that Apple was content with, and even 
wanted, higher prices, and that Apple's cooperation with the Publisher Defendants enabled them to raise prices. "
1455,69," As for some of the notable features of the iBookstore itself, features such as a page curl, Apple was not the first to invent 
these concepts. Nonetheless, having the creativity and commitment of Apple invested in the enhancement of a product like the 
iBookstore is extremely beneficial to consumers and competition. "

1462,34," Plaintiffs contend that legal representation, expert testimony, and discovery for RICO and FDCPA claims is extremely

1463,40," Plaintiffs have not quantified the cost of individual arbitration nor have they shown that the cost would preclude an individual

attorney general role for the typical RICO plaintiff is simply less plausible than it is for the typical antitrust plaintiff, and does not 
support a finding that there is an irreconcilable conflict between arbitration and enforcement of the RICO statute.""). Although 
Shearson did not involve a class action waiver, the comparison with antitrust law is still instructive in terms of congressional 
intent and arbitrability generally."
1463,43," See Italian Colors, 570 U.S.    , 133 S. Ct. at 2309 (finding relevant that ""[t]he Sherman and Clayton Acts make no mention of

a minimum individual recovery, not to exceed the lesser of $500,000 or 1 per centum of the net worth of the debt collector""). This 
is not, of course, the same as requiring individual arbitration of claims, but it is relevant as it indicates that Congress did not 
intend to promote class actions."

1469,3," Although  [**11] Spectrofuge Corp. is now 35 years old, its articulation of the concept of cross-elasticity of supply remains 
sound. See JULIAN VON KALINOWSKI ET AL., 2 ANTITRUST LAWS AND TRADE REGULATION § 24.02[1][c], at 24-55 (2d ed. 2012) 
(""Another important factor in defining a product market is the ability of existing companies to alter their facilities to produce the 
defendant's product. The Supreme Court has long recognized the significance of this factor, often referred to as cross-elasticity 
of supply."") (footnote omitted); PHILLIP AREEDA, HERBERT HOVENKAMP, & JOHN SOLOW, IIB ANTITRUST LAW ¶ 561, at 360 (3d ed. 
2007) (""[I]f B producers can costlessly switch production to product A in a short time and can readily distribute the resulting 
output, they will constrain the prices of A firms in virtually the same way as another A firm.""). "
1470,4," We do not mean to suggest that companies always act to maximize profits in the short term. Indeed, conduct that appears 
unprofitable—such as a dominant player flooding the market with its product in order to bring prices down—may actually be 
rational and profit maximizing because it is part of a large  [**14] and/or long-term anticompetitive scheme to drive competitors 
from the market or enforce cartel discipline. See, e.g., Christopher Leslie, Rationality Analysis in Antitrust, 158 U. Pa. L. Rev. 
261, 273, 274-85, 327-28 (2010). "
1472,1," Plaintiff provides paraphrases of testimony and attached email communications between Revision and Lovely Skin, both 
obtained from unrelated litigation, in support of these allegations. (Id. ¶¶ 16-17, Exs. A-C.) For example, Plaintiff provides 
paraphrased testimony from Dr. Joel Schlessinger, the owner of Lovely Skin, stating ""that he had on-going communications with 
Revision and that Lovely Skin was not making independent decisions about its prices."" (Id. ¶ 17.) Dr. Schlessinger allegedly 
further testified that he turned to Revision for acceptable product pricing and ""testified that he sought to ensure that all retailers 
were 'working in concert with' Revision and other manufacturers because it could 'potentially hurt' Lovely Skin if they did not."" 
(Id.) Plaintiff also claims to have received information by a Revision representative in the 2007-2008 time period ""that Revision 
and Lovely Skin had 'special arrangements' with respect to  [*5] pricing of Revision products."" (Id. ¶ 18.) "
1473,," With respect to the purported email exchanges between Revision and Lovely Skin representatives, Plaintiff offers them as 
evidence of Defendants' price-fixing discussions. (Id. ¶ 20.) Plaintiff contends that the emails indicate that ""Revision was using its 
successes in terminating retailers who did not acquiesce to its price fixing agreement to ensure Lovely Skin's continued 
adherence to a price fixing agreement."" (Id., Ex. A at 18.) Plaintiff provides email communication indicating that Lovely Skin was 
participating in the shutting down of retailers that sold Revision products at a discount. (Id. ¶ 21, Ex. A at 17, Ex. C at 99.) 
Plaintiff alleges that when viewing the testimony, email communications, and other allegations as a whole, it is ""clear that 
Revision and Lovely Skin were participants in a classic per se minimum vertical price fixing scheme for many years."" (Id. ¶ 27.) "
1475,2," The emails in Exhibit C reference shutting websites down for ""violating  [*13] [Revision's] internet policies."" (Id., Ex. C; see also 
id. Ex. A at 18.) However, Plaintiff alleges that ""Revision did not maintain policies requiring retailers to invest in improvements to 
their websites,"" (id. ¶ 11), and neither Defendant makes any argument as to the existence of the internet policies, their nature, or 
the greater role they may have played."
1475,3," To the extent the Court previously indicated otherwise, (see 04/10/13 Order at 7), the Court only intended to convey that a 
plaintiff needed to allege sufficient information to make the existence of an agreement plausible. Twombly requires only that. 550 
U.S. at 557. This can be done by ""alleg[ing] facts such as a 'specific time, place, or person involved in the alleged conspiracies' . 
. . ."" Kendall v. Visa U.S.A., Inc., 518 F.3d 1042, 1047 (9th Cir. 2008)  [*15] (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 565 n.10) (emphasis 
added). Twombly holds that ""[a]sking for plausible grounds to infer an agreement does not impose a probability requirement at 
the pleading stage; it simply calls for enough facts to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of illegal 
agreement."" Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556. The Court finds that Defendants are asking for more than evidence of an agreement; 
they are asking for the agreement itself. This exceeds what is required at this stage. "
