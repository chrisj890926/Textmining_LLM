28,1," The Court found with regard to the claim for essential facilities, that the Ninth Circuit continues to recognize the doctrine 
 [*4] and that a jury could find that United's lost profits equal practical or reasonable exclusion from the building. (Slania Dec. at ¶ 
3; Ex. 1 at 86: 16-19; 96:23-24.) The Court also ruled that there was sufficient evidence of antitrust injury because Dr. Patrick 
Kennedy testified regarding damages in terms of lost profit, expenses and overhead. (Id. at 94:22-24.) In ruling on the claim for 
attempted monopolization, the Court found that the evidence presented by United could establish a case from which a jury could 
determine that all of the requisite elements had been met. (Id. at 110:12-14.) In ruling on the claim for intentional interference 
with contractual relations, the Court ruled there was evidence offered for which a jury could find for United. (Id. at 80:10-14.) In 
ruling on the claim for intentional interference with prospective economic relations, the Court granted the motion as to United's 
relationships with Fern, Spargo, Nielsen and Blaine. The court denied the motion as to United's relationships with Brede National 
(""Brede"") and Paradice Decorating (""Paradice"") on the grounds that there was sufficient evidence regarding United's 
relationships with those two companies that  [*5] the jury could reasonably find a probability that those relationships would have 
continued. (Id. at 67:16-24.) "
29,2," The Court denied SDC's motion finding that SDC did not satisfy its burden to be entitled to judgment on either of its defenses. 
(Slania Dec. at ¶ 4; Ex. 2 at 53:23-54:3.) Regarding the immunity defenses, the Court denied ""the defense request for judgment 
as a matter of law under 50(a), to the extent they are immune from antitrust damages. Again, the same jury could find contrary to 
their interest and not apply the immunity in favor of Plaintiff with its ruling."" (Id.) "

based its moratorium was not a sufficient ""clear articulation and affirmative expression"" of a state policy to restrain trade in the 
cable television business. Id. at 52-56, 102 S. Ct. at 841-843. The Court reasoned: HN13[
] [P]lainly the requirement of ""clear articulation and affirmative expression"" is not satisfied when the State's position 
is one of mere neutrality respecting the municipal actions challenged as anticompetitive. A State that allows its "

Plaintiff plead an injury that is the type of injury that the antitrust laws target, the first and most important factor in federal antitrust 
standing[.] If Plaintiff does not allege an antitrust injury, that is the end of the inquiry"") (citations omitted). Moreover, such injury 
must not be ""secondary, consequential, or remote, but the direct result of the unlawful conduct."" Cellular Plus, 14 Cal. App. 4th

intended to prevent,"" the Cartwright Act's more liberal standing requirements do not avail Plaintiffs here, and this cause of action, 
too, is DISMISSED. Moreover, the Provider and Association Plaintiffs' Cartwright  [**55] Act causes of action are subject to 
dismissal for the additional reason that, as discussed supra, their injuries ""result from injury [to the Subscribers,]"" and therefore 
are merely ""secondary"" or ""consequential."" See Kolling, 137 Cal. App. 3d at 717; accord Lorenzo v. Qualcomm Inc., 603 F.

credits, property, or other assets of any employee welfare benefit plan or employee pension benefit plan, or of any fund 
connected therewith, shall be fined under this title, or imprisoned not more than five years, or both."" "
88,6," These causes of action are dismissed against the UHG Defendants for the additional reason that the CTAC still fails to explain 
their involvement in any purported acts of embezzlement. See August 11 Order, p. 28 (""There is no mention that UHG 
Defendants had a role in crafting the false or misleading statements, or any other involvement, and there is no mention that UHG 
Defendants had access to the health plans' funds, let alone that they converted those funds to their own use.""). As the ERISA 
Plaintiffs have failed to remedy the defects identified by the Court, Plaintiffs' embezzlement-based RICO claims against the UHG 
Defendants are DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE. "
89,7," The Court dismissed Plaintiffs' cause of action under § 1132(c) without leave to amend in the August 11 Order on the grounds 
that while an insurer can properly be sued under § 1132(a)(1)(B) and § 1132(a)(3), ""only the plan administrator can be held 
liable for failing to comply with [§ 1132(c)]."" See Vaught v. Scottsdale Healthcare Corp. Health Plan, 546 F.3d 620, 633 (9th Cir. 
2008); 29 U.S.C. § 1132(c)  [**84] (""[a]dministrator's refusal to supply requested information."") (emphasis added). Plaintiffs re-
plead this claim ""in an abundance of caution"" in light of the purportedly unsettled state of the law regarding whether a Plaintiff 
must re-plead dismissed claims in subsequent iterations of a Complaint in order to preserve their dismissal for appeal. See 
CTAC, p. 141, fn.3. For the reasons set forth in the August 11 Order, this claim is again dismissed with prejudice. "
90,8," Plaintiffs also point to an implementing regulation requiring that ""[a]ny description of exception, limitations, reductions, and 
other restrictions of plan benefits shall not be minimized, rendered obscure or otherwise made to appear unimportant. Such 
exceptions, limitations, reductions, or restrictions of plan benefits shall be described or summarized in a manner not less 
prominent than the style, captions, printing type, and prominence used to describe or summarize  [**90] plan benefits."" 29 C.F.R. 
§ 2520.102-2(b). This regulation is entitled ""Style and format of summary plan description"" and subpart (b) bears the heading 
""General format."" Id. As the quoted language itself indicates, this regulation is concerned with ensuring that the physical 
appearance and format of an SPD presents its contents in an evenhanded manner, not with the substance of the SPD's 
disclosures. Accordingly 29 C.F.R. § 2520.102-2(b) is inapposite. "
95,9," As noted, Plaintiffs' FAL cause of action relies on the same allegations as Plaintiffs' first type of deceptive conduct. See CTAC 
¶ 477. Accordingly, Plaintiffs' FAL cause of action is DISMISSED for the same reasons. "
116,1," Dr. Cohlmia initially included a number of additional defendants in his complaints, see Aplt. App. at 260-64, but those 
defendants settled prior to the disposition below. See Docket Entry 430 (05/18/2009). At this time, the only parties left in this 
case are Dr. Cohlmia and the corporate entity through which he practices, along with SJMC and two of its physicians in their 
individual capacities. "
117,2," Dr. Cohlmia urges that he was ""forced to withdraw"" from these institutions as a result of ""sham peer review"" that was completed 
""for political purposes,"" Aplt. Br. at 24, but the record does not support this assertion. "
119,3," The district court distinguished Brown and rejected Dr. Cohlmia's reliance on the case, finding: It was clear in Brown that an economic competitor had instigated the review, made false misstatements to the National 
Practitioner Databank, that the doctor had been found negligent and the competitor testified against the plaintiff[. I]n that 
case there was overwhelming proof of conjuring up evidence against the doctor. Here, the evidence of ulterior motive is 
inferential and in this case the Court concludes that the plaintiff has not rebutted the presumptions set out under the statute. Aplt. App. at 3123."
119,4," Likewise, Brown does not stand for the proposition that a mere battle of the experts is sufficient to overcome the presumption. 
HN4[
] ""[W]hen the issue subject to peer review only concerns a single incident, summary suspension will inherently require 
less intensive fact finding and data compilation than would be the case with a review of a physician's care over several years."" 
Johnson v. Christus Spohn, No. C-06-138, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10058, 08 WL 375417, at *9 (S.D. Tex. Feb. 8, 2008). In 
Johnson, the court held that a hospital took reasonable efforts to obtain the facts when it investigated only one case, involving a 
lack of adequate  [**15] and timely care for a chicken pox patient, prior to terminating a doctor's staff privileges. "
120,5," In addition, none of Dr. Cohlmia's direct competitors at SJMC participated in any stage of the peer review process. See Aple. 
Supp. App. at 545 and 1096 (identifying  [**18] competitors as Drs. Garrett, Blankenship, and Fore); id. at 588, 1045, 1201-02, 
and 1204-05 (listing attendance at the various stages of review). As to expert review, during the hearing presided over by Judge 
Brett, SJMC engaged the services of a thoracic surgeon who was currently on an extended sabbatical from medical practice—so 
certainly not a competitor at the time. See id. at 691. "
123,6," Dr. Cohlmia cites a number of other cases in support of his view that antitrust injury can be demonstrated without an ""actual 
lessening of competition or an increase in prices."" Aplt. Br. at 32 (quoting Blue Shield of Virginia, 457 U.S. at 482). But the cases 
he  [**27] cites were primarily decided at the motion to dismiss stage when the court is still determining jurisdiction, and are 
predicated on a finding of ""an abusive peer review process""—a finding we rejected above by concluding that SJMC is entitled to 
HCQIA immunity. See Balaklaw v. Lovell, 14 F.3d 793, 795 n.2 (2d Cir. 1994); Fuentes v. South Hills Cardiology, 946 F.2d 196 
(3d Cir. 1991); Mishler v. St. Anthony's Hosp. Sys., 694 F.2d 1225 (10th Cir. 1981); Full Draw Prods. v. Easton Sports, Inc., 182 
F.3d 745 (10th Cir. 1999). "
124,7," Additionally, we disagree with Dr. Cohlmia's citation to Oltz v. St. Peter's Community Hosp., 861 F.2d 1440 (9th Cir. 1988), for 
the proposition that anti-competitive behavior by a hospital can evidence antitrust injury for ""two different segments of the 
economy. . . . the market in which anesthesia providers compete for staff privileges . . . [and] the patient market for anesthesia 
services."" Id. at 1447. While  [**31] the Ninth Circuit did so hold, the facts in Oltz indicate that St. Peter's had an 84% market 
share for surgical services. Id. at 1442. In such a case, an exclusive agreement to exclude the plaintiff from the market—where 
such a large showing of market share is demonstrated and conceded by the defendants—is fair evidence of antitrust injury. "
125,8," Dr. Cohlmia refers back to the district court's opinion denying SJMC's motion to dismiss, Cohlmia I, as evidence of ""the misuse 
of the peer review process."" Aplt. Br. at 37. But the district court was ruling  [**36] on Dr. Cohlmia's motion to dismiss—which is 
based on different evidentiary standards than a ruling for summary judgment. In this appeal, we review the grant of summary 
judgment based on whether Dr. Cohlmia has marshaled record evidence to support his claims, not mere allegations of wrongful 
conduct. "
126,9," Dr. Cohlmia  [**38] disputes this characterization, stating that the area hospitals were ""already taking measures to deny [his] 
privileges,"" in a ""secret"" review process. Aplt. Rep. Br. at 14. But even so, his privileges were still intact at the time of SJMC's 
suspension. And in any event, as discussed below, Dr. Cohlmia failed to provide proof of his damages, which is required for 
recovery."
126,10," In 2010, Rule 56(f) was amended and the substance is now embodied in Rule 56(d) instead. For simplicity's sake, we refer to 
Rule 56(f) to comport with the record in this case."
126,11, The merits of this evidentiary report are discussed in greater detail below in subsection 4. 
134,1," In Equilon's Request for Judicial Notice submitted with its motion and throughout its motion and reply briefs, Equilon claims it 
has attached the Order Granting in Part Defendant's Motion for Expert Witness Fees, Armaswalker v. Equilon Enterprises LLC, 
et al., Case No. CV 09-7183 ODW (PLAx), 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 145270 (C.D. Cal. Sept. 28, 2010) as Exhibit 2 to its Request 
for Judicial  [*19] Notice (""RJN""). See, e.g., RJN ¶ 2, Docket No. 87-1; Mot. at 18 n. 7. The document attached as Exhibit 2 to 
the RJN, however, is from a different case—AID, Inc. v. Equilon Enterprises, LLC, Case No. CV 09-7188 ODW (PLAw). "
135,2," Because Equilon's motion for partial summary judgment that the offers are bona fide is denied on this basis, the court need not 
address Plaintiffs' arguments that (1) the offers are not bona fide because Nakash's bids  [*22] on the Stations were bundled 
with multiple other rights and thus included inflated prices for the Stations; (2) the terms and conditions in the ROFRs and the 
Third Party Offers differ; and (3) that Equilon failed to offer its entire interest in the Stations. "
140,1," Chase requests that the Court take judicial notice of the above facts. See RJN. In deciding a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the Court 
generally looks only to the face of the complaint and documents attached thereto. See Settle v. World Sav. Bank, F.S.B., No. ED 
CV 11-00800 MMM (DTBx), 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4215, 2012 WL 1026103, at *3 (C.D. Cal., Jan. 11, 2012). However, the 
Court may consider certain documents outside the pleadings without the proceeding turning into summary judgment. See Lee v. 
City of Los Angeles, 250 F.3d 668, 688-89 (9th Cir. 2001). In particular, the Court may consider: (a) documents that are 
""properly submitted as part of the complaint""; (b) documents on which plaintiff's complaint necessarily relies and whose 
authenticity is not contested; and (c) ""matters of public record"" of which the court may take judicial notice under Rule 201 of the 
Federal Rules of Evidence. See id. (internal quotations omitted). ""Judicial notice is appropriate for records and 'reports of 
administrative bodies.'"" United States v. 14.02 Acres of Land More or Less in Fresno County, 547 F.3d 943, 955 (9th Cir. 
2008). Accordingly, to the extent relied on in this Order, the Court takes judicial notice of the assignment, substitution of trustee 
and notice of default recorded by the San Bernardino County Recorder's Office. See Settle, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4215, 2012 
WL 1026103, at *3. The Court also takes judicial notice of the OTS's appointment of the FDIC as Receiver for Wamu and the P 
&A Agreement under which Chase acquired ""all mortgage servicing rights and obligations of [Wamu],"" see RJN, Ex. 2, § 3.1, as 
this information is available on governmental websites and is not reasonably subject to dispute. See id.; Laborer's Pension Fund 
v. Blackmore Sewer Const., Inc., 298 F.3d 600, 607-08 (7th Cir. 2002) (taking judicial notice of information on FDIC's official 
website). "
148,1," Plaintiff refers to BanxCorp v. LendingTree LLC, No. 10-2467, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12258, 2011 WL 541807 (D.N.J. Feb. 7, 
2011). That action was once separate from this case but has since been consolidated."
148,2," The Court recognizes that ""the existence of antitrust injury is not typically resolved through motions to dismiss."" Schuylkill 
Energy Res., Inc. v. Pa. Power & Light Co., 113 F.3d 405, 417 (3d Cir. 1997) (citation omitted). However, the Court also notes 
that ""courts are required to accept all well-pleaded allegations in the complaint as true and draw all reasonable inferences in 
favor of the non-moving party."" Phillips v. Cnty. of Allegheny, 515 F.3d 224, 231 (3d Cir. 2008). Accordingly, accepting Plaintiff's 
allegations in the 5AC as true, the Court cannot find that Plaintiff, a competitor, has standing to sue for a market 
division/customer allocation conspiracy, the effect of which was to raise prices. "
151,1," Unless otherwise indicated, docket entries refer to the lead case 3:08-cv-490. "
153,2," In fact, discovery was ordered  [*10] to close on August 13, 2012 [DE 193]. Given that there are remaining discovery disputes 
to be decided, an extension of discovery will be provided herein."
153,3," This instruction was previously provided to the parties on June 9, 2011 and February 17, 2012 [DE 173; DE 193]. "
163,1," Service Corporation International and Alderwoods Group, Inc. merged several years after the lawsuit was filed but before the 
present appeal. "
165,2," Although Sciambra II dominated the parties' discussion of this issue in briefing and during the district court's hearing, the district 
court did not mention Sciambra II in its decision. Instead, the district court relied upon the general proposition stated by the 
Seventh Circuit in  [**10] Ortiz v. John O. Butler Co., 94 F.3d 1121 (7th Cir. 1996), that, ""where a plaintiff has received all of the 
requested relief to which she is legally entitled, there is no longer the requisite case or controversy, and the court is without 
jurisdiction."" 94 F.3d at 1125 (emphasis added). However, Appellants did not receive all of the relief they requested in this case; 
consistent with the Clayton Act, they requested further monetary relief in the form of mandatory attorneys' fees and costs, if an 
antitrust action against any Defendant is ""sustained."" Additionally, Ortiz did not involve attorneys' fees or the Clayton Act. The 
Seventh Circuit determined that Ortiz was not ""entitled to compensatory damages over and above the lost wages and benefits 
that were offset by the NLRB settlement"" because she waived her arguments by failing to raise them before the district court. Id. 
at 1126. "
166,3," Indeed, because there has been no determination of liability with respect to the alleged antitrust violation on the part of any 
Appellees, a decision to the contrary would result in a windfall not negotiated for by any party. Appellees would benefit from a 
settlement that they had no role in and avoid any determination that they violated antitrust law even though the Stewart 
settlement explicitly disclaimed resolution for or against antitrust liability even as to Stewart. Further, new consumers with 
unsettled compensatory damages claims could begin this case anew to determine liability. "
167,4," Indeed, even the concurrence observed that if one accepts that ""Sciambra [was] rightly decided, then it is clear that an antitrust 
plaintiff can proceed to trial for a determination of liability and a potential fee award, even where prior settlements already have 
clearly negated any actual receipt of further damages."" Gulfstream III Associates v. Gulfstream Aerospace (Gulfstream II), 995 
F.2d 425, 443 (3d Cir. 1993) (Greenberg, J., concurring). Judge Greenberg cited several arguments to support his view, 
including that: (1) attorneys' fees and costs are mandatory under the Clayton Act; (2) the magnitude of attorneys' fees and costs 
indicate they are a ""crucial component of a plaintiff's recovery"" that may exceed the compensatory damages sought; and (3) a 
trial merely to determine whether to award attorneys' fees and costs will be extremely rare. Id. at 442-44."
167,5," The Appellees mistakenly rely upon the following language in Lewis: ""[t]his interest in attorney's fees is, of course, insufficient 
to create an Article III case or controversy where none exists on the  [**21] merits of the underlying claim."" Id. at 480 (citing 
Diamond v. Charles, 476 U.S. 54, 70-71, 106 S. Ct. 1697, 90 L. Ed. 2d 48 (1986)). Both Lewis and Diamond are distinguishable 
from our case. Diamond sought to defend the constitutionality of part of an Illinois abortion law based on his personal objection 
to abortions and his status as a pediatrician and as a parent of an unemancipated minor daughter. 476 U.S. at 56-58. He "
168,," appealed the Seventh Circuit's grant of a permanent injunction after the State of Illinois chose not to appeal. Id. at 61. Because 
Diamond had no judicially cognizable interest in the statute's defense, the Supreme Court dismissed for want of jurisdiction. Id. 
at 56. The Court held that Diamond did not have standing to appeal simply because the district court had assessed the plaintiffs 
attorneys' fees against him under § 1988 and he would have to pay those fees unless the State's regulations were reinstated on 
appeal. Id. at 69-70. It was not the case that Diamond ""'personally has suffered some actual or threatened injury as a result of 
the putatively illegal conduct of the defendant,' and that the injury 'fairly can be traced to the challenged action' and 'is likely to be 
redressed by a favorable  [**22] decision,'"" as required by Article III. Id. at 70 (internal citations omitted). The Court determined 
that: [a]ny liability for fees is, of course, a consequence of Diamond's decision to intervene, but it cannot fairly be traced to the 
Illinois Abortion Law. The fee award is wholly unrelated to the subject matter of the litigation, and bears no relation to the 
statute whose constitutionality is at issue here. Id. By contrast, Appellants in the instant case allege that they were injured by the ""putatively illegal conduct of the defendant."" 
Attorneys' fees and costs are part of the compensation mandated in § 4 as a result of a defendant's provable violation of federal 
antitrust laws. Thus, the mandatory fee award is a part of the subject matter of the litigation and must be awarded to every 
successful plaintiff."
168,6," Appellants argue the ""capable of repetition, yet evading review"" doctrine should apply to allow for Article III standing. However, 
HN14[
] even in the mootness context, ""the capable-of-repetition doctrine applies only in exceptional  [**25] situations, and 
generally only where the named plaintiff can make a reasonable showing that he will again be subjected to the alleged illegality."" "
169,," City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 108, 103 S. Ct. 1660, 75 L. Ed. 2d 675 (1983) (citing DeFunis v. Odegaard, 416 U.S. 
312, 319, 94 S. Ct. 1704, 40 L. Ed. 2d 164 (1974)). Here, as explained below, none of the eleven individual consumer appellants 
has made this demonstration."
169,7," Appellants refer to Credit Bureau Reports, Inc. v. Retail Credit Co., 476 F.2d 989 (5th Cir. 7 1973), and Supreme Beef 
Processors, Inc. v. U.S. Dep't of Agric., 275 F.3d 432 (5th Cir. 2001), for the proposition that possible or potential harm is 
sufficient to establish injunctive standing. Credit Bureau Reports did not discuss whether a past harm is sufficiently likely 
 [**27] to occur in the future to warrant an injunction but instead discussed whether the plaintiff was close enough to entering a 
market to argue the defendant's monopolization kept the plaintiff from entering. 476 F.2d at 993. In Supreme Beef Processors, 
we decided that the plaintiff could still seek an injunction because it was possible that the defendant would not be forced to close 
its business after bankruptcy proceedings; if this was not possible, an injunction would have been unnecessary. 275 F.3d at 436-
37. The case was mooted during proceedings; standing was not lacking from the outset. Id. at 436-38."
169,8," Although Appellants contend that one of the Consumer Appellants purchased another casket from SCI after the suit was filed, 
as  [**29] the district court held, it is not clear that she purchased a Batesville casket. Further, this contention was stated by 
Plaintiff-Appellants' counsel in oral argument for the motion to dismiss, and no substantiating evidence was presented in the 
record. "
170,9," If the association seeking standing does not have traditional members, as here, the association establishes its standing by 
proving that it has ""indicia of membership"": its members elect leadership, serve as the organization's leadership, and finance the 
organization's activities, including the case's litigation costs. Hunt, 432 U.S. at 344-45. The organization  [**32] must represent 
the individuals it claims as members and provide ""the means by which [those individuals] express their collective views and 
protect their collective interests."" Id. at 345. Appellees argue that FCA does not have standing to pursue injunctive relief because 
FCA does not have any members. We do not determine whether FCA has members as defined by Hunt because even assuming 
the FCA has members, the FCA has not, on the record before us, met the first prong of the Hunt test. Compare id. at 344-45, 
with Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Chevron Chem. Co., 129 F.3d 826 (5th Cir. 1997), and Assoc. for Retarded Citizens of Dallas 
v. Dallas Cnty. Mental Health & Mental Retardation Ctr. Bd. of Trustees, 19 F.3d 241 (5th Cir. 1994)."
170,10," Because the district court erred in dismissing Appellants' claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, it is undisputed that we 
have jurisdiction to review the district court's denial of class certification. "
171,11," Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) states: HN21[
] (a) Prerequisites. One or more members of a class may sue or be sued as representative parties on behalf of all 
members only if: (1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable; (2) there are questions of law or 
fact common to the class; (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of 
the class; and (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. HN22[
] Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3) states class certification is allowed only if: (3) the court finds that the questions of law or  [**34] fact common to class members predominate over any questions 
affecting only individual members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently 
adjudicating the controversy. The matters pertinent to these findings include: (A) the class members' interests in individually 
controlling the prosecution or defense of separate actions; (B) the extent and nature of any litigation concerning the 
controversy already begun by or against class members; (C) the desirability or undesirability of concentrating the litigation 
of the claims in the particular forum; and (D) the likely difficulties in managing a class action."
171,12," Appellants do not contest the district court's denial of Rule 23(b)(2) injunctive class certification in their briefing, so we will not 
address  [**35] that issue. See Cinel v. Connick, 15 F.3d 1338, 1345 (5th Cir. 1994) (HN23[
] ""An appellant abandons all 
issues not raised and argued in its initial brief on appeal.""). "
172,13," The Court explained that it had ""never mentioned loss causation as a precondition for invoking Basic's rebuttable presumption 
of reliance,"" known as the ""fraud-on-the-market"" theory and that, therefore, securities fraud plaintiffs seeking class certification 
are only required to prove common questions of law or fact relating to the characteristics of an alleged misrepresentation, not 
common reliance by all class members on that misrepresentation. Halliburton, 131 S. Ct. at 2185-86."
172,14," It is also worth noting that the evidence that Appellants refer to most in their substantive arguments concerning class 
certification (presumably that which they believe to be most probative) is the Consumer Plaintiffs' Class Certification Post-
Hearing Brief, including a table summarizing expert testimony, not the Dr. Vistnes' reports they contend were ignored by the 
district  [**41] court. "
173,15," Appellants' reliance on our decision in Hernandez to contend that the district court must have reviewed all the evidence in the 
case is misplaced. Hernandez involved an order from the district court adopting a magistrate judge's M&R that was issued 
before transcripts of the parts of the class certification hearing that were objected to were available for the  [**42] district court's 
review. 711 F.2d at 620. Here, Appellants made no argument that relevant portions of evidence or the record were unavailable 
to Judge Hoyt at the time he issued his order. "
174,16," Similarly, Appellants assert that the district court erroneously rejected and failed adequately to discuss their expert's proffered 
common methodology for calculating class members' damages. Appellants do not dispute that HN32[
] a court must find a 
common methodology for computing class-wide damages in order to certify a class. Bell Atl., 339 F.3d at 304; Blue Bird, 573 
F.2d at 317; Piggly Wiggly, 100 F. App'x at 297 (""The necessity of calculating damages on an individual basis, by itself, can be "
175,," grounds for not certifying a class.""). However, a district court is not obligated to discuss or  [**51] accept Appellants' expert's 
proffered common damages formula. See Piggly Wiggly, 100 F. App'x at 299 (affirming a denial of class certification despite the 
plaintiffs' complaints that the district court failed even to discuss their expert's view that class members' damages could be 
calculated in a straightforward manner). "
186,1," This determination is contrary to the evidence of ACS's objections to proposed jury instructions, which specifically state, ""You 
may award general damages for these statements * * *."" ACS's objections and proposed instructions were filed with the trial 
court prior to the issuance of the jury instructions. "
189,2," We recognize that the ""sham litigation"" definition set forth in Professional Real Estate Investors was created within the context 
of federal antitrust law. However, we find its rationale to be identical to the issue in the present case, i.e., maintaining access to 
the courthouse. Moreover, applying the Professional Real Estate Investors test to lawsuits outside the context of federal 
antitrust law is not a new concept for this court. See Greer-Burger v. Temesi, 116 Ohio St.3d 324, 2007 Ohio 6442, 879 N.E.2d 
174. In Greer-Burger, an employer retaliation case, we first adopted the test in Professional Real Estate Investors. Id. at ¶ 11. 
Therefore, HN9[
] the analysis in Professional Real Estate Investors is not limited to the confines of federal antitrust [****22] law, but is applicable to cases involving unfair competition claims based upon malicious litigation. "
190,3," HN11[
] Noerr-Pennington immunity is a ""doctrine [that] originated in the anti-trust context as the proposition that 'joint efforts 
to influence public officials do not violate the antitrust laws even though intended to eliminate competition. Such conduct is not 
illegal, either standing alone or as part of a broader scheme itself violative of the Sherman Act.'"" WE, Inc. v. Philadelphia, Dept. 
of Licenses & Inspections, 174 F.3d 322, 326 (3d. Cir.1999), quoting United Mine Workers of Am. v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 
670, 85 S.Ct. 1585, 14 L.Ed.2d 626 (1965); see also Noerr, 365 U.S. 127, 81 S.Ct. 523, 5 L.Ed.2d 464. The United States 
Supreme Court has held, ""Those who petition government for redress are generally immune from antitrust liability."" Professional 
Real Estate Investors, 508 U.S. at 56, 113 S.Ct. 1920, 123 L.Ed.2d 611. This type of immunity from antitrust liability is otherwise 
known as Noerr-Pennington immunity."
190,4," Many courts have held that  [****26] Noerr-Pennington immunity should be raised as an affirmative defense. See Bayou Fleet, 
Inc. v. Alexander, 234 F.3d 852, 860 (5th Cir.2000); Acoustic Sys., Inc. v. Wenger Corp., 207 F.3d 287 (5th Cir.2000); North 
Carolina Elec. Membership Corp. v. Carolina Power & Light Co., 666 F.2d 50, 52 (4th Cir.1981). Even so, as the Fifth Circuit in 
Bayou Fleet explained, HN12[
] the general rule of waiver does not apply when the defense is raised later but does not result 
in unfair surprise or ""if it is raised at a 'pragmatically sufficient time, and the plaintiff was not prejudiced in its ability to respond.'"" 
Id. at 860, quoting Chambers v. Johnson, 197 F.3d 732, 735 (5th Cir.1999). "
196,5," Although we recognize that we first adopted the standard in Greer-Burger, which was in the context of employee retaliation, we 
make clear that consistent with its origins, it applies in full for claims of unfair competition by way of malicious litigation. "
233,1," Count I his headed ""Tortious Interference with Business Relationship with Transhield,"" but it is apparent that Count I is based 
on Shield's alleged interference with Vold's business relationship with the DOD. (See Vold Counterclaim ¶ 5 (Alleging that ""Vold 
has a valid business expectancy with his work with the DOD."") "
235,2, Shield has not  [*10] cited any authority indicating that the privilege is applied differently under Illinois law. 
237,3," Vold also cites Lynchval Sys., Inc. v. Chicago Consulting Actuaries, Inc., No. 95 C 1490, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3998, 1998 WL 
151814, *8 (N.D. Ill. Mar. 27, 1998). While Lynchval held that a lawsuit allegedly filed in bad faith supported claims for unfair 
competition and tortious interference, it did so without analyzing the issue presented here."
237,4," The only case that has cited Cacique since it was published likewise rejected its analysis. See Rubloff Development Group, 
Inc. v. SuperValu, Inc.,     F.Supp.2d    , 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 41304, 2012 WL 1032784, *11 (N.D. Ill. Mar. 27, 2012). "
241,5," Transhield also asserts in its first affirmative defense that it acted in ""good faith."" As we discussed in connection with Vold, we 
are not aware of any legal authority recognizing a general ""good faith"" affirmative defense. Indeed, from the context of 
Transhield's pleading, it appears that ""good faith"" is asserted merely to negate the mental state that Shield purportedly must 
prove to establish liability. Transhield cites Federal Practice and Procedure for the proposition that a assert both a denial and an 
affirmative defense in the alternative. See 5 Wright & Miller, Fed. Prac. & Proc. Civ. § 1270 (3d Ed.). But this ability to plead 
defenses in the alternative does not mean that denials are affirmative defenses, and courts in this District continue  [*32] to 
recognize the difference between the two when ruling on Rule 12(f) motions. See, e.g., Electrolux, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 45637, 
2012 WL 1108424, *1."
241,6, We express no opinion on the merits of these affirmative defenses.
241,7," We expect that the defendants now have sufficient guidance to adequately plead their affirmative defenses. Unless their 
amended defenses are patently deficient, the court is likely to deny summarily any further Rule 12(f) motion by Shield as dilatory. "
247,1," The district court also concluded that Simon's state law claims were preempted and insufficiently pled. Because we hold that 
the state law claims are barred by the filed rate doctrine, we need not consider whether the district court was correct on these 
points."
247,2," NYISO is an Independent System Operator (""ISO"") created to administer the retail electricity market in New York. See 
generally Promoting Wholesale Competition Through Open Access Non-Discriminatory Transmission Services by Public 
Utilities; Recovery of Stranded Costs by Public Utilities and Transmitting Utilities, 61 Fed. Reg. 21,540 (Apr. 24, 1996) (codified 
at 18 C.F.R. pts. 35 & 385); see also Cal. Indep. Sys. Operator Corp. v. FERC, 372 F.3d 395, 397, 362 U.S. App. D.C. 28 (D.C. 
Cir. 2004) (describing FERC's efforts to encourage public utilities to create ISOs). "
248,3," These firms were created in 1998 when Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc. (""Con Ed"") divested most of its 
generating capacity. The three firms are known collectively as Divested Generation Owners (""DGOs""). See Order Conditionally 
Approving Proposal, 122 FERC ¶ 61,211, ¶ 3 (2008)  [**6] (""2008 Market Power Modification Order"")."
248,4," KeySpan had considered acquiring Astoria's physical generating assets, but did not pursue this approach due to antitrust 
concerns."
248,5," The United States also recently settled a civil suit with Morgan Stanley arising from these same facts. See United States v. 
Morgan Stanley, 881 F. Supp. 2d 563, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 113459, 2012 WL 3194969 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 7, 2012). There, the "
249,," consent decree required Morgan Stanley to disgorge to the United States Treasury $4.8 million of the net revenues that it had 
earned from the agreement. 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 113459, [WL] at *2-*3. "
250,6," We need not determine whether Simon qualified for antitrust standing under New York law, see generally Ho v. Visa U.S.A. 
Inc., 3 Misc. 3d 1105A, 787 N.Y.S.2d 677 (Table) (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 2004), because we conclude that his state claims are barred 
by the filed rate doctrine. "
251,7," We share the district court's skepticism that the markets for installed capacity and retail electricity are similar enough to allow a 
seamless pass-through in this way, but we nevertheless assume for the present that Simon could prove this to be the case at 
trial. See Simon, 785 F. Supp. 2d at 137 (""[T]he proposition that Con Ed is able to pass through one hundred percent of any 
overcharge to its consumers in the form of retail price increases is suspect given the differing nature of the two markets.""). "
253,8," Simon also argues in his brief that the filed rate doctrine is limited to certain statutes and does not apply to rates set under the 
Federal Power Act, 16 U.S.C. §§ 796, et seq. This argument is unavailing, as Supreme Court precedent makes clear that HN13[ ] the doctrine applies in all instances where rates are set by federal agencies. See Arkla, 453 U.S. at 577-78."
253,9," Simon's reliance on Morgan Stanley Capital Grp. Inc. v. Pub. Util. Dist. No. 1 of Snohomish Cnty., 554 U.S. 527, 546, 128 S. 
Ct. 2733, 171 L. Ed. 2d 607 (2008), is misplaced. Morgan Stanley dealt with HN14[
] the Mobile-Sierra doctrine, which applies to ""market based tariffs,"" i.e., bilateral contracts between wholesalers and purchasers that are not directly submitted for rate 
approval. Id. at 537-38. It does not implicate the filed rate doctrine. See Simon, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 57142, 2011 WL 
2135075, at *2-3 (describing and distinguishing Morgan Stanley opinion). "

action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy."" "
276,3," In its prior Order at the motion to dismiss stage, the Court also noted that Lakeland Regional's claims may survive the Illinois 
Brick rule pursuant to Lowell v. American Cyanamid Co., 177 F.3d 1228 (11th Cir. 1999). In Lowell, the Eleventh Circuit reversed 
the district court's application of Illinois Brick to dismiss an antitrust action. The Eleventh Circuit reasoned, among other things, 
that because the complaint contained no allegations of ""pass on""  [*14] overcharges, the holding of Illinois Brick did not apply. At 
this juncture, Lakeland Regional's claims have been crystallized and the Court ascertains that Lakeland Regional does sue 
based on ""pass on"" overcharges. Accordingly, Lowell does not preclude application of the Illinois Brick rule in this case. "
277,4," In Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir. 1981), the Eleventh Circuit adopted all cases decided by the Fifth

281,2, Gamesa Spain is not a party to this lawsuit; Outland alleges that Gamesa is owned  [*8] and controlled by Gamesa Spain. 
285,3," Outland's brief nevertheless directs the Court's attention to an August 31, 2011 letter sent by Gamesa's attorneys that was not 
incorporated into the complaint. To the extent that Outland seeks to amend his complaint via his reply brief, the Court declines to 
do so and instructs Outland to follow the amendment procedures outlined in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15. In any case, 
nothing in the letter gives rise to a claim for tortious interference with prospective economic  [*19] advantage. The letter states 
that Outland had solicited Gamesa's customers in violation of a non-compete clause within the FSA, and that Gamesa intended 
to enforce the agreement. Where a defendant acts to enhance its own interests, it is insulated from liability for harming the 
plaintiff's expectancy. Fid. Nat'l Title Ins. Co. v. Westhaven Props. P'ship, 386 Ill. App. 3d 201, 898 N.E.2d 1051, 1067-68, 325

332,9," Although Plaintiffs brought claims under three statutes (Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act and Section 3 of the Clayton Act), 
our analysis regarding the applicability of the price-cost test is the same for all of Plaintiffs' claims. HN6[
] In order to establish 
an actionable antitrust violation, a plaintiff must show both that the defendant engaged in anticompetitive conduct and that 
 [**20] the plaintiff suffered antitrust injury as a result. Atl. Richfield Co. v. USA Petroleum Co., 495 U.S. 328, 339-40, 110 S. Ct. 
1884, 109 L. Ed. 2d 333 (1990). Because a lack of anticompetitive conduct precludes a finding of antitrust injury, the key 
question for us is whether Eaton engaged in anticompetitive conduct. See id. at 339 (""Antitrust injury does not arise . . . until a 
private party is adversely affected by an anticompetitive aspect of the defendant's conduct.""). HN7[
] Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act and Section 3 of the Clayton Act each include an anticompetitive conduct element, although each statute articulates that element in a slightly different way. Under Section 1 of the Sherman Act, a plaintiff 
must establish that the defendant was a party to a contract, combination or conspiracy that ""imposed an unreasonable restraint 
on trade."" 15 U.S.C. § 1; In re Ins. Brokerage Antitrust Litig., 618 F.3d 300, 314-15 (3d Cir. 2010). Under Section 2, a plaintiff 
must demonstrate that the defendant willfully acquired or maintained its monopoly power in the relevant market. 15 U.S.C. § 2; 
United States v. Grinnell Corp., 384 U.S. 563, 570-71, 86 S. Ct. 1698, 16 L. Ed. 2d 778 (1966). ""A monopolist willfully acquires "
333,," or maintains monopoly power when it competes  [**21] on some basis other than the merits."" LePage's Inc. v. 3M, 324 F.3d 141, 
147 (3d Cir. 2003) (en banc) (citing Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., 472 U.S. 585, 605 n.32, 105 S. Ct. 2847, 
86 L. Ed. 2d 467 (1985)). Finally, Section 3 of the Clayton Act makes it unlawful for a person to enter into an exclusive dealing 
contract where the effect of such an agreement is to substantially lessen competition or create a monopoly. 15 U.S.C. § 14. HN8[
] Exclusive dealing claims may be brought under Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act and Section 3 of the Clayton Act. LePage's, 324 F.3d at 157. Additionally, the Supreme Court has held that the price-cost test is not confined to any one antitrust 
statute, and applies to pricing practices claims under the Sherman Act, the Clayton Act, and the Robinson-Patman Act. Brooke 
Grp. Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 509 U.S. 209, 222-23, 113 S. Ct. 2578, 125 L. Ed. 2d 168 (1993); Atl. Richfield, 
495 U.S. at 339-40. Thus, regardless of which test applies, that test is applicable to each of Plaintiffs' claims."
333,10," HN10[
] Evidence of an agreement is expressly required under Section 1 of the Sherman Act and Section 3 of the Clayton Act. See 15 U.S.C. §§ 1 and 14. However, an agreement is not necessarily required under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, which 
can provide a vehicle for challenging a dominant firm's unilateral imposition of exclusive dealing on customers. See 15 U.S.C. § 
2; Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law ¶ 1821a, at 183 (3d ed. 2011). "
336,11," Despite the arguments of amicus curiae, the American Antitrust Institute, our decision in LePage's v. 3M does not indicate 
otherwise. In LePage's, we declined to apply the price-cost test to a challenge to a bundled rebate scheme, reasoning 
 [**36] that such a scheme was better analogized to unlawful tying than to predatory pricing. See 324 F.3d at 155. In that case, 
the plaintiff (LePage's) was the market leader in sales of ""private label"" (store brand) transparent tape. Id. at 144. As LePage's 
market share fell, it brought suit against 3M, alleging that 3M, which manufactured Scotch tape, some private label tape, and a 
number of other products, leveraged its monopoly power over Scotch brand tape and other products to monopolize the private 
label tape market. Id. at 145. Specifically, LePage's challenged 3M's multi-tiered bundled rebate program, which offered 
progressively higher rebates when customers increased purchases across 3M's different product lines. Id. The rebate programs 
also set customer-specific target growth rates. Id. at 154. The sizes of the rebates were linked to the number of product lines in 
which the targets were met; if a customer failed to meet the target for any one product, it would lose the rebates across all 
product lines. Id. LePage's could not offer these discounts because it did not sell the same diverse array of products as 3M. Id. 
at 155. Relying on Brooke Group Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 509 U.S. 209 (1993), 113 S. Ct. 2578, 125 L. Ed. 2d 168, 
3M  [**37] argued that its bundled rebate program was lawful because the rebates never resulted in below-cost pricing. We 
disagreed, reasoning that the principal anticompetitive effect of 3M's bundled rebates was analogous to an unlawful tying 
arrangement: when offered by a monopolist, the rebates ""may foreclose portions of the market to a potential competitor who 
does not manufacture an equally diverse group of products and who therefore cannot make a comparable offer."" LePage's, 324 
F.3d at 155. For several reasons, we interpret LePage's narrowly. Most important, HN20[
] in light of the analogy drawn in LePage's 
between bundled rebates and unlawful tying, which ""cannot exist unless two separate product markets have been linked,"" 
Jefferson Parish Hosp. Dist. No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 21, 104 S. Ct. 1551, 80 L. Ed. 2d 2 (1984), abrogated on other grounds 
by Ill. Tool Works Inc. v. Indep. Ink, Inc., 547 U.S. 28, 126 S. Ct. 1281, 164 L. Ed. 2d 26 (2006), LePage's is inapplicable where, 
as here, only one product is at issue and the plaintiffs have not made any allegations of bundling or tying. The reasoning of 
LePage's is limited to cases in which a single-product producer is excluded through a bundled rebate program offered by a 
producer of multiple products, which conditions  [**38] the rebates on purchases across multiple different product lines. 
Accordingly, we join our sister circuits in holding that the price-cost test applies to market-share or volume rebates offered by 
suppliers within a single-product market. See NicSand, Inc. v. 3M Co., 507 F.3d 442, 452 (6th Cir. 2007); Concord Boat Corp. v. 
Brunswick Corp., 207 F.3d 1039, 1061 (8th Cir. 2000); Barry Wright Corp. v. ITT Grinnell Corp., 724 F.2d 227, 236 (1st Cir. 
1983). Additionally, several of the bases on which we distinguished Brooke Group have been undermined by intervening Supreme 
Court precedent, which counsels caution in extending LePage's. For example, we indicated in LePage's, 324 F.3d at 151, that 
Brooke Group might be confined to the Robinson-Patman Act, but the Supreme Court has made clear that the standard adopted 
in Brooke Group also applies to predatory pricing claims under the Sherman Act. Weyerhaeuser Co. v. Ross-Simmons "
337,," Hardwood Lumber Co., 549 U.S. 312, 318 n.1, 127 S. Ct. 1069, 166 L. Ed. 2d 911 (2007). Additionally, LePage's, 324 F.3d at 
151-52, suggested that Brooke Group is not applicable in cases involving monopolists, but the Supreme Court has since applied 
Brooke Group's price-cost test to claims against a monopolist,  [**39] Pac. Bell Tel. Co. v. linkLine Commc'ns, Inc., 555 U.S. 
438, 447-48, 129 S. Ct. 1109, 172 L. Ed. 2d 836 (2009), and a monopsonist, Weyerhaeuser, 549 U.S. at 320-25. Finally, we 
observed in LePage's that, in the years following Brooke Group, the Supreme Court had only cited the case four times (and for 
unrelated propositions), but since LePage's, the Court has reaffirmed and extended Brooke Group. See linkLine, 555 U.S. at 
447-48; Weyerhaeuser, 549 U.S. at 325. In doing so, the Court emphasized the importance of Brooke Group in light of 
""developments in economic theory and antitrust jurisprudence,"" and downplayed the significance of seemingly inconsistent 
circuit court antitrust precedent from the 1950s and 1960s, some of which we referenced in LePage's. See linkLine, 555 U.S. at 
452 n.3. "
340,12," HN24[
] Monopsony power is market power on the buy (or input) side of the market. Weyerhaeuser, 549 U.S. at 320. ""As such, a monopsony is to the buy side of the market what a monopoly is to the sell side[.]"" Id. (citing Roger Blair & Jeffrey 
Harrison, Antitrust Policy and Monopsony, 76 Cornell L. Rev. 297, 301, 320 (1991)). "
341,13," Eaton also relies heavily on the Supreme Court's statement in Atlantic Richfield v. USA Petroleum Co. that price-cost 
principles apply ""regardless of the type of antitrust claim involved."" 495 U.S. at 340. When read in context, however, it is clear 
that this statement means that the price-cost test applies regardless of the statute under which a pricing practices claim is 
brought, not that the price-cost applies regardless of the type of anticompetitive conduct. In Atlantic Richfield, the plaintiffs argued that no showing of below-cost pricing was required to establish antitrust injury for a 
claim of illegal price-fixing under Section 1 of the Sherman Act because the price agreement itself was illegal, and any losses 
that stem from such an agreement, by definition, flow from that which makes the defendant's conduct unlawful. Id. at 338. The 
Supreme Court rejected that argument, reasoning that although price-fixing is unlawful under Section 1, a plaintiff does not suffer 
antitrust injury unless it is adversely affected by an anticompetitive aspect  [**56] of the defendant's conduct, and ""in the context 
of pricing practices, only predatory pricing has the requisite anticompetitive effect."" Id. at 339 (citing Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo 
Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 U.S. 477, 487, 97 S. Ct. 690, 50 L. Ed. 2d 701 (1977)) (additional citations omitted). It was in this in 
context, in rejecting an argument that Section 1 was somehow exempt from the price-cost test, that the Supreme Court made 
the broad statement that it has ""adhered to . . . [price-cost] principle[s] regardless of the type of antitrust claim involved."" See id. 
at 340. The Court's discussion following this statement supports our interpretation. The Court went on to explain that, for purposes of 
determining whether a plaintiff has suffered antitrust injury in a pricing practices case, Section 1 is no different than, for example, 
the plaintiff's allegation in Cargill, Inc. v. Monfort of Colorado, Inc. that the defendants' unlawful merger under Section 7 of the 
Clayton Act caused antitrust injury. Id. at 340 (citing Cargill, 479 U.S. at 116) (""To be sure, the source of the price competition in 
the instant case was an agreement allegedly unlawful under § 1 of the Sherman Act rather than a merger in violation of § 7 of 
the  [**57] Clayton Act. But that difference is not salient.""). Moreover, Atlantic Richfield was decided before LePage's and we did 
not interpret the ""regardless of the type of antitrust claim involved"" language as mandating the application of the price-cost test 
to 3M's bundled rebates. "
342,14," Our dissenting colleague objects to the phrase ""de facto partial exclusive dealing"" as constituting a creative neologism that 
""distorts the English language"" and infrequently appears in a search of an online legal database. Dissenting Op., Part II. ""De 
facto partial exclusive dealing"" is certainly a neologism, but it also accurately represents that an exclusive dealing claim does not 
require a contract that imposes an express exclusivity obligation, Tampa Elec., 365 U.S. at 326; Dentsply, 399 F.3d at 193; 
LePage's, 324 F.3d at 157, nor a contract that covers 100% of the buyer's needs, Tampa Elec., 365 U.S. at 328 (""[T]he 
competition foreclosed by the contract  [**61] must be found to constitute a substantial share of the relevant market."") (emphasis 
added). "
343,15," In 2003, for example, PACCAR failed to meet its market penetration target, and although Eaton withdrew all contractual 
savings, it did not terminate the agreement."
343,16," Additionally, the District Court instructed the jury that Plaintiffs did not allege ""actual"" exclusive dealing, but instead alleged that 
""the long-term supply contracts with defendant, in effect, committed the OEMs to purchase at least a substantial share of their 
transmissions from defendant."" The District Court defined such an arrangement as a ""'de facto' exclusive dealing contract."" 
Eaton does not challenge this instruction on appeal. "
345,17," Eaton emphasizes that the OEMs are multi-billion dollar companies (or at least owned by multi-billion dollar parent 
 [**71] companies), and therefore claims that the OEMs dictated terms to Eaton — not the other way around. Significantly, in 
United States v. Dentsply International, Inc., we found coercion even though the relationship between the customers and the 
defendant was not totally one-sided. 399 F.3d 181, 185 (3d Cir. 2005) (noting that the defendant considered bypassing dealers 
and selling directly to customers but abandoned that strategy out of fear that dealers might retaliate by refusing to buy other 
products manufactured by the defendant). Moreover, even assuming that the evidence could support a conclusion that the 
OEMs had more power in the relationship, the fact that two reasonable conclusions could be drawn from the evidence does not 
make the jury's adoption of Plaintiffs' view unreasonable."
345,18," ZF Meritor's expert, Dr. David DeRamus, testified at trial that Eaton's market share was consistently above 80% from 2000 
through 2007. Later in his testimony, DeRamus concluded that Eaton's increased market share from 2000 to 2007 was the result 
of the LTAs. Furthermore, DeRamus showed that ZF Meritor's market share percentages in the linehaul transmissions market 
(i.e., the only portion of the overall HD  [**74] transmissions market in which ZF Meritor competed), dropped from 32% to 24% 
between 2000 and 2002, and dropped even further from 24% to 12% between 2002 and 2003, before ultimately falling to 0% in 
2007. DeRamus concluded that the loss of ZF Meritor's linehaul transmissions market share and its eventual exit from the 
market were due to Eaton's conduct and, specifically, the LTAs. "
346,19, Eaton and Freightliner revised their original LTA to increase the duration to ten years. 
347,20," Judge Greenberg, in dissent, objects that our rule of reason analysis fails to consider that Eaton's prices were above cost. 
Dissenting Op., Part II. However, contrary to this objection, and even though ZF Meritor does not contend that Eaton's prices 
operated as an exclusionary tool, we do not view Eaton's prices as irrelevant to the rule of reason analysis. Rather than 
analyzing the alleged exclusionary provisions in a vacuum, we analyze these provisions in the larger context of the LTAs as a 
whole, and we recognize that Eaton maintained above-cost prices. We conclude that ZF Meritor presented sufficient evidence 
for the jury to find that, even though not every provision was exclusionary, the LTAs as a whole functioned as exclusive dealing 
agreements that adversely affected competition."
347,21," It is worth noting that despite Eaton's contention that Plaintiffs' higher prices and quality problems led to their decline in market 
share, the OEMs felt differently. In 2002, a Freightliner  [**82] executive wrote: ""[t]his is a dangerous situation. We have already 
killed Meritor's transmission business. It is just a matter of time before they close their doors."" Likewise, a 2006 Volvo 
presentation states: ""With all its OEM customers, Eaton has established long term supply contracts . . . [which] ha[ve] led to . . . 
Eaton's only North American competitor, Meritor, [being] gradually marginalized to its current market position with a 10% market 
share."" "
348,22," Eaton also argues that DeRamus's testimony was contrary to law because he did not employ a price-cost test. However, as 
we explained above, no price-cost test was required in this case. "
349,23," The SBP contained a five-year forecast of profit and loss estimates based on estimated unit sales, unit prices, manufacturing 
 [**88] costs, operating expenses, and other considerations. "
351,24," As the District Court noted, it is especially important  [**94] for an expert to identify and justify the assumptions underlying 
financial projections when dealing with a new company. Here, although Meritor had been in the HD transmissions industry for 
over a decade, ZF Meritor was offering a brand new line of transmissions that had never before been sold in the North American 
market."
351,25," We base our affirmance of the District Court's decision entirely on the fact that DeRamus's opinion failed Rule 702, and do not 
decide whether Rule 703 provides an additional basis for exclusion. We note, however, that Plaintiffs' argument that Rule 703 
somehow constrains a district court's ability to conduct an assessment of reliability under Rule 702 is misplaced. After all, a 
piece of evidence may be relevant for one purpose, and thus admissible at trial, but not be the type of information that can form 
the basis of a reliable expert opinion. As the District Court stated, ""the fact that [a piece of evidence] [i]s part of [the] plaintiffs' 
'story' does not mean, ipso facto,"" that an expert opinion relying on such evidence is admissible. ZF Meritor LLC v. Eaton Corp., 
800 F. Supp. 2d 633, 637 (D. Del. 2011). "
352,26," Although the District Court  [**101] did not address DeRamus's lost enterprise value calculations, Plaintiffs indicated in their 
motion for clarification that DeRamus could make similar revisions to those calculations. "
353,27," It is unclear from the record why sixteen months passed between Eaton's motion and the District Court's decision on the 
motion. "
356,28," We express no opinion as to the reliability or admissibility of DeRamus's alternate damages calculations. That is a matter left 
to the District Court on remand. However, we note that Plaintiffs'  [**116] motion for clarification only sought to include damages 
calculations based on data already in the expert report, and that fact is crucial to our holding that prejudice to Eaton can be 
easily cured. Nothing in our opinion should be read as requiring the District Court to allow Plaintiffs to bring in entirely new data 
for the revised damages estimates."
356,29," Even though Meritor was still technically in the HD transmissions business at the time the complaint in this case was filed, it is 
still appropriate to frame this issue as one of standing, rather than one of mootness. Plaintiffs' complaint, which was filed on 
October 5, 2006, stated that Meritor intended to exit the HD transmissions business in January 2007, and did not indicate any 
intent to reenter. Thus, even at the time the complaint was filed, Plaintiffs could not demonstrate the requisite likelihood of future 
injury sufficient to confer standing. See Davis v. F.E.C., 554 U.S. 724, 734, 128 S. Ct. 2759, 171 L. Ed. 2d 737 (2008) (HN59[
] 
""[T]he standing inquiry [is] focused on whether the party invoking jurisdiction had the requisite stake in the outcome when the 
suit was filed."") (citations omitted); U.S. Parole Comm'n v. Geraghty, 445 U.S. 388, 397, 100 S. Ct. 1202, 63 L. Ed. 2d 479 
(1980) (""The requisite personal interest that must exist at the commencement of the litigation (standing) must continue 
throughout its existence (mootness)."") (citation omitted). Moreover, even if we treated this as a mootness question, our 
conclusion  [**118] would remain the same. "
357,30," In a post-trial status conference, the District Court asked Plaintiffs' counsel why an injunction would be appropriate given that 
Plaintiffs were no longer in the business. Plaintiffs' counsel could give no more concrete information about Plaintiffs' plans than 
the witness, stating simply that, if Eaton's conduct was enjoined, ""a different set of calculations"" would apply to Plaintiffs' 
discussions regarding reentry into the market. "
358,31," Specifically, Plaintiffs argue that the appropriate standard is found in Section 16 of the Clayton Act, which provides that any 
person ""shall be entitled to sue for and have injunctive relief . . . against threatened loss or damage by a violation of the antitrust 
laws . . . when and under the same conditions and principles  [**124] as injunctive relief . . . is granted by courts of equity."" 15 
U.S.C. § 26."
358,32," Because we conclude that Plaintiffs lack standing to pursue injunctive relief, we need not address Plaintiffs' argument that the 
District Court erred by refusing to allow them to address the scope of injunctive relief."
358,1," Throughout this dissent I use the same standard of review that the majority sets forth. Thus while I am exercising plenary 
review of the order denying the motion for a judgment as a matter of law within that review I am being deferential to the jury 
verdict. "
359,2," ""Standard"" and ""preferred"" positioning are not the same thing. See J.A. at 2546 (PACCAR and Eaton's LTA) (stating that 
PACCAR will list Eaton's product ""as Standard Equipment and the Preferred Option,"" whereas ""'Standard Equipment' means the 
equipment that is provided to a customer unless the customer expressly designates another supplier's product"" and ""'Preferred 
Option' means the lowest priced option in the Data Book for comparable products"")."
359,3, I refer to the plaintiffs as appellees even though they are also appellants in  [**129] these consolidated appeals. 
361,4," As explained below, ZFM dissolved in December of 2003, and thus Meritor was handling sales of the FreedomLine 
transmission in the NAFTA market as of 2004."
361,5," International already had listed Eaton as the standard option as of 1996 because, according to an International representative, 
Eaton provided the greatest value to International. See J.A. at 1533. "
362,6," Eaton also entered into an LTA with the OEM Mack Trucks that same month. Volvo had acquired Mack Trucks in 2001, and it 
appears that the LTAs are substantively the same. Accordingly, I refer only to the Volvo LTA. "
364,7," Under the Brooke Group price-cost test, a firm must first establish that the defendant's prices ""are below an appropriate 
measure of its . . . costs,"" and second, it must show that the defendant ""had a reasonable prospect [under § 1 of the Sherman 
Act], or, under § 2 of the Sherman Act, a dangerous  [**145] probability, of recouping its investment in below-cost prices."" 509 
U.S. at 223-24, 113 S.Ct. at 2587-88."
364,8," Apart from meeting the requirements of Article III standing, an antitrust plaintiff seeking monetary or injunctive relief must show 
that it has suffered antitrust injury, i.e., an ""injury of the type that the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flows from 
that which makes [the] defendant['s] acts unlawful."" Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 U.S. 477, 489, 97 S.Ct. 
690, 697, 50 L. Ed. 2d 701 (1977). Although courts often conflate the antitrust injury requirement with the determination of 
whether the defendant's conduct violated the antitrust laws, this approach is erroneous as the antitrust injury requirement 
assumes the defendant's conduct was unlawful (and thus anticompetitive) and asks whether the anticompetitive aspect of the 
unlawful conduct is the cause of plaintiff's injury. See Angelico v. Lehigh Valley Hosp., Inc., 184 F.3d 268, 275 n.2 (3d Cir. 1999) 
(""The District Court erred by incorporating the issue of anticompetitive market effect into its standing analysis, confusing antitrust 
injury with an element of a claim under section 1 of the Sherman Act . . . ."");  [**146] see also Daniel v. Am. Bd. of Emergency 
Med., 428 F.3d 408, 447-48 (2d Cir. 2005) (explaining that anticompetitive effects of defendant's behavior ""are classic 'rule of 
reason' questions, distinct from the antitrust standing question"") (citations omitted). Because I conclude that Eaton was entitled 
to judgment as a matter of law as there was insufficient evidence for the jury's conclusion that Eaton violated Sections 1 and 2 of 
the Sherman Act and Section 3 of the Clayton Act, I do not address whether appellees satisfied the antitrust injury requirement. 
Accord L.A.P.D., Inc. v. Gen. Elec. Corp., 132 F.3d 402, 404 (7th Cir. 1997) (""Because LAPD adequately alleges injury in fact 
and thus has standing under Article III, however, we may bypass the antitrust-injury issue to go straight to the merits.""); Hairston 
v. Pac. 10 Conference, 101 F.3d 1315, 1318 (9th Cir. 1996) (""[W]e need not decide whether appellants have met the 
requirements for antitrust standing, because they have failed to establish any violation of the antitrust laws.""); Levine v. Cent. Fl. 
Med. Affiliates, Inc., 72 F.3d 1538, 1545 (11th Cir. 1996) (""We need not decide whether Dr. Levine has met the requirements for 
standing  [**147] as to any of his antitrust claims, because as to each one he has failed to establish any violation of the antitrust 
laws."")."
364,9," A firm engages in ""predatory pricing"" when it cuts its prices below an appropriate measure of cost to force competitors out of 
the market or to deter potential entrants from entering the market. See Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 
U.S. 574, 584 n.8, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 1355 n.8, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). ""The success of any predatory scheme depends on 
maintaining  [**148] monopoly power for long enough both to recoup the predator's losses and to harvest some additional gain."" 
Id. at 589, 106 S.Ct. at 1357 (emphasis in original). Due to the inherently speculative nature of such an undertaking, ""predatory 
pricing schemes are rarely tried, and even more rarely successful."" Id."
364,10," As the leading antitrust treatise points out, ""to be challenged as unlawful exclusive dealing, . . . [a] quantity discount program 
would necessarily involve prices above cost, else the program would not be sustainable."" Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert 
Hovenkamp, Fundamentals of Antitrust Law § 18.03b, at 18-70 (4th ed. 2011)."
364,11," Throughout this opinion I use the term ""pricing practices"" to encompass the variety of ways in which a firm may set its prices, 
including but not limited to, straightforward price cuts and conditional rebates or discounts. "
365,12," I recognize that the majority states that Eaton's low prices are not irrelevant to the extent they may help explain why the OEMs 
entered the LTAs even though the LTAs allegedly included terms that were unfavorable to the OEMs and to rebut an argument 
that the agreements were inefficient but the majority does not factor the circumstance that Eaton's prices were above cost into its 
analysis of whether the LTAs were exclusionary and anticompetitive, and I believe its failure to do so is error."
365,13," I cannot utilize this phrase without making the point that where a court permits a non-exclusive, non-mandatory supply 
agreement to morph into a mandatory exclusive-dealing contract to legitimize a plaintiff's claim of unlawful ""de facto partial 
exclusive dealing"" the court follows antitrust plaintiffs down the rabbit hole a bit too far. While ""de facto partial exclusive dealing"" 
is a creative neologism, the phrase not only distorts the English language (in what other realm would one refer to a contract as 
""partially exclusive""?), it takes us so far from the text of Section 3 of the Clayton Act and the actual concept of exclusive dealing 
that I shudder to think what will be labeled as exclusive dealing next. The majority concedes that ""partial exclusive dealing is rarely a valid antitrust theory."" Typescript at 43 (internal quotation marks 
omitted). Indeed, the only thing rarer may be what appellees actually allege here: ""de  [**153] facto partial exclusive dealing."" I 
am not aware of any Supreme Court or court of appeals precedent recognizing such a claim, and a Westlaw search of the 
phrase reveals only one other case recognizing the concept as a viable antitrust claim. In a sign that we truly have come full 
circle, that case is a class action pending in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware brought by truck 
purchasers against Eaton, the four OEMs, and a handful of other entities, alleging that the same LTAs at issue here violated 
Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act and Section 3 of the Clayton Act. See Wallach v. Eaton Corp., 814 F. Supp. 2d 428, 442-
43 (D. Del. 2011). "
367,14," As did Cargill, Brunswick Corp. involved a competitor's antitrust challenge to an allegedly illegal acquisition under Section 7 of 
the Clayton Act because it would have brought a ""'deep pocket' parent into a market of 'pygmies.'"" 429 U.S. at 487, 97 S.Ct. at 
697. The Court concluded that the plaintiff could not show antitrust injury based on the losses it would suffer from that acquisition 
because the aspect of the merger that made it unlawful did not cause the plaintiffs losses. See id. The majority interprets the Supreme Court's statement it had adhered to the principle that ""in the context of pricing practices only 
predatory pricing has the requisite anticompetitive effect"" ""regardless of the type of antitrust  [**160] claim involved"" to mean 
""that the price-cost test applies regardless of the statute under which a pricing practice claim is brought, not that the price-cost 
[test] applies regardless of the type of anticompetitive conduct."" Typescript at 38 n.13. While the Supreme Court's statement 
undoubtedly makes clear that the principle that above-cost pricing is not anticompetitive applies regardless of which provision of 
the antitrust laws is at issue, I believe that the Court's rather clear statement that it had adhered to this principle ""regardless of 
the type of antitrust claim involved"" means exactly what it says — that whether the plaintiff challenges a defendant's pricing 
practices in the context of a challenge to an allegedly unlawful merger or whether it does so in the context of a claim that a 
defendant has entered a price-fixing agreement a plaintiff cannot contend that the prices resulting from those arrangements are 
anticompetitive unless they are below cost. While I do not believe that the Court's statement in this regard requires that the price-
cost test apply with dispositive force in every challenge to a defendant's pricing practices because there may be other elements 
of a defendant's  [**161] conduct that are anticompetitive notwithstanding its above-cost prices, the Court's reasoning 
undoubtedly lends support to my conclusion that the price-cost test must factor into a court's decision when it is asked to judge 
the lawfulness of such a defendant's rebate program. "
369,15," An equally important facet of the Court's decision in Linkline, in a context quite apart from that here, was its holding that a 
plaintiff may not bring a Section 2 Sherman Act price-squeeze claim ""when the defendant is under no antitrust obligation to sell 
the inputs to the plaintiff in the first place."" 555 U.S. at 442, 129 S.Ct. at 1115."
369,16," As noted, in the case of PACCAR's and International's respective LTAs, Eaton provided up-front cash payments in addition to 
market rebates. Although these payments were not in the form of rebates, they cannot be distinguished from the market-share "
370,," rebates because both practices were an avenue for Eaton ultimately to provide discounted prices to the OEMs. Accord Race 
Tires Am., Inc. v. Hoosier Racing Tire Corp., 614 F.3d 57, 79 (3d Cir. 2010) (noting that tire manufacturer's offer of up-front 
payments to race sanctioning bodies to select manufacturer's tires presented no more a coercive threat than an offer of lower 
prices); NicSand, Inc. v. 3M Co., 507 F.3d 442, 452 (6th Cir. 2007) (en banc) (noting that defendant's cash payments to induce 
retailers to carry its product solely were ""nothing more than price reductions offered to the buyers"") (internal quotation marks and 
citation omitted)."
370,17," Likewise, I concur fully with the majority's point that a firm may engage in anticompetitive conduct without engaging in below-
cost pricing. The antitrust laws proscribe an array of conduct that, of course, does not require as an essential element below-
cost pricing. For example, tying arrangements, unlawful mergers, and price-fixing agreements, to name a few, are all practices 
that may violate the antitrust laws regardless of the prices resulting from such conduct. The Supreme Court has made clear, 
however, that where an antitrust plaintiff attacks a defendant's pricing practices, i.e. price cuts, rebates or the like, if those 
practices result in above-cost prices they generally do not threaten competition, regardless of the source or type of antitrust 
claim at issue."
370,18," Appellees rely heavily on LePage's Inc. v. 3M, 324 F.3d 141 (3d Cir. 2003) (en banc), and contend that our decision in that 
case precludes the possibility that the price-cost test has any applicability outside of the predatory-pricing-claim framework. For 
essentially the same reasons the majority sets forth, I, too, believe that LePage's must be confined  [**174] to its facts and in any 
event does not bear on the present factually-distinguishable case. LePage's dealt with bundled rebates, a practice which we analogized to tying arrangements in its exclusive potential and which 
we concluded may exclude an equally efficient but less diversified rival even if the bundled rebates resulted in above-cost prices. 
See 324 F.3d at 155 (""The principal anticompetitive effect of bundled rebates as offered by 3M is that when offered by a 
monopolist they may foreclose portions of the market to a potential competitor who does not manufacture an equally diverse 
group of products and who therefore cannot make a comparable offer.""). Above-cost single-product market-share discounts, 
however, do not present the same putative danger of excluding an equally efficient but less diversified rival by virtue of that 
rival's limited production alone. For this exact reason, as I explain in further detail below, the same leading antitrust treatise upon 
which LePage's relied to analogize bundled rebates to tying concludes that single-product market-share discounts are more 
appropriately likened to straightforward price cuts and the Brooke Group price-cost test should control  [**175] challenges to 
such programs. Thus, I concur with the majority that our reasoning in that case necessarily is limited to a single-product "
371,," producer's claim that it has been excluded through a more-diversified competitor's bundled rebate program that conditioned 
discounts on the purchase of products that the single-product producer did not offer. Additionally, while I believe that LePage's' bases for distinguishing Brooke Group stood on questionable grounds when we set 
them forth nine years ago, as the majority notes the Supreme Court's subsequent decisions have eviscerated those bases and 
counsel that we do not extend LePage's beyond its original parameters. Furthermore, in concluding that LePage's must be 
confined to its facts, I think it appropriate to point out that there has been considerable academic criticism of our opinion in that 
case. See, e.g., J. Shahar Billbary, Predatory Bundling and the Exclusionary Standard, 67 Wash. & Lee L. Rev. 1231, 1246 (Fall 
2010) (""[T]he main problem with the LePage's test is that it does not investigate whether a bundled discount is pro-competitive. . 
. . [It] may in fact protect a less efficient competitor (as LePage's admitted to be.""); Richard  [**176] A. Epstein, Monopoly 
Dominance or Level Playing Field? The New Antitrust Paradox, 72 U. Chi. L. Rev. 49, 49, 61-72 (Winter 2005) (criticizing 
LePage's' reasoning and noting that the case ""shows the deleterious consequences that flow from the aggressive condemnation 
of unilateral practices""). Moreover, another court of appeals specifically has declined to follow LePage's, see Cascade Health 
Solutions, 515 F.3d at 903. But perhaps most significantly, the Antitrust Modernization Commission, a statutorily-created 
bipartisan group tasked with evaluating the state of antitrust law and setting forth recommendations to Congress and the 
President for its modernization, criticized LePage's as potentially ""harm[ing] consumer welfare,"" and proposed instead that 
courts adopt a three-part test modeled after Brooke Group's below-cost pricing test to evaluate the lawfulness of bundled 
discounts.

371,19," In this regard I note that Eaton's rebate program existed in the same form, above-cost prices and all, on the day before 
 [**179] appellees filed their claim as on the day after they filed their claim. The program did not undergo an ontological 
transformation because appellees had enough prudence not to challenge the price aspects of the program. "
372,20," Of course, the majority in effect if not intent encourages an antitrust plaintiff challenging a defendant's above-cost pricing 
practices simply to avoid any mention of defendant's prices. In light of the majority's approach, it would be the rare case indeed 
in which a sophisticated plaintiff would bring an exclusive dealing claim against a defendant's above-cost pricing practices and 
allege that price itself functioned as the exclusionary tool for such a claim necessarily would be ill-fated under the majority's 
approach."
372,21," The majority quotes from Areeda and Hovenkamp to explain the treatise's perspective that a dominant firm may employ 
exclusive-dealing contracts to preclude a young rival's expansion. I do not doubt the truth of this statement but as I note above 
the treatise takes the position that market-share  [**187] discount programs that do not condition the discount on exclusivity, 
which precisely describes Eaton's program, are, in fact, not exclusive dealing contracts and should not be treated as such. 
Areeda and Hovenkamp suggest that where a market-share discount program conditions the discount on exclusivity the 
standards applicable to exclusive dealing should apply. See Fundamentals of Antitrust Law, § 18.03b, at 18-65 (""A discount 
conditioned on exclusivity should generally be treated as no different than an orthodox exclusive-dealing arrangement.""). "
373,22," Of course, HD truck transmissions are not fungible products. Indeed, this fact is an unstated premise of appellees' claims 
because they contend essentially that the FreedomLine was far superior to Eaton's transmissions and that its failure in the 
marketplace can be attributed only to Eaton's anticompetitive conduct. "
374,23," As  [**189] I explain below, Areeda and Hovenkamp take the position that Section 3 does not encompass non-exclusive 
market-share discount programs."
374,24," The majority collapses appellees' three claims into one analysis, and while that approach is not necessarily incorrect and the 
three provisions at issue overlap substantially, I believe it most prudent to address the claims separately as the provisions at 
issue have some distinct elements that require separate  [**191] discussion. In this case, I make many more citations to the record than judges of this Court ordinarily would make in an opinion. I do so 
because while deference to the jury's verdict requires that we not reweigh the evidence and that we view the evidence in the 
light most favorable to appellees, where, as here, the evidence supporting that verdict falls so short of the standard required to 
sustain that verdict I believe it appropriate to point not only to the absence of evidence supporting the jury verdict but also to the 
considerable undisputed evidence contradicting that verdict. "
375,25," In Tampa Electric, the Court indicated that if an arrangement is lawful under Section 3 of the Clayton Act it will be lawful under 
both Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. See 365 U.S. at 335, 81 S.Ct. at 632 (""We need not discuss the respondents' further 
contention that the contract also violates § 1  [**195] and § 2 of the Sherman Act, for if it does not fall within the broader 
proscription of § 3 of the Clayton Act it follows that it is not forbidden by those of the former."") (citing Times-Picayune Publ'g Co. 
v. United States, 345 U.S. 594, 608-09, 73 S.Ct. 872, 880, 97 L. Ed. 1277 (1953)). In Barr Laboratories, however, we disposed 
of the plaintiff's Section 1 Sherman Act claim with its Section 3 Clayton Act claim but we addressed the plaintiff's Section 2 
Sherman Act claim separately. See 978 F.2d at 110-12; see also Dentsply, 399 F.3d at 197 (concluding that the district court 
erred in stating that defendant had not violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act solely because it had concluded that defendant 
had not violated Section 3 of the Clayton Act) (citing LePage's, 324 F.3d at 157 n.10). For this reason, I subsume appellees' 
Section 1 Sherman Act claim within its Section 3 claim but I address separately appellees' Section 2 Sherman Act claim. "
377,26," In substance, the Tampa Electric standard for Clayton Act Section 3 claims differs very marginally, if at all, from the fact-
intensive rule-of-reason analysis that applies to this case under Section 1 of the Sherman Act. Cf.  [**201] Deutscher Tennis 
Bund v. ATP Tour, Inc., 610 F.3d 820, 830 (3d Cir. 2010) (""The rule of reason requires the fact-finder to weigh [] all of the 
circumstances of a case in deciding whether a restrictive practice should be prohibited as imposing an unreasonable restraint on 
competition. The inquiry is whether the restraint at issue is one that promotes competition or one that suppresses competition."") 
(quotation marks and citations omitted). Indeed, it appears more often than not that in a Section 1 case courts explicitly employ 
the Tampa Electric standard as the guiding framework for the rule-of-reason analysis. See, e.g. Allied Orthopedic Appliances 
Inc. v. Tyco Health Care Grp., 592 F.3d 991, 996 (9th Cir. 2010) (""Under the antitrust rule of reason, an exclusive dealing 
arrangement violates Section 1 only if its effect is to 'foreclose competition in a substantial share of the line of commerce 
affected.'"") (quoting Omega Envtl., 127 F.3d at 1162); see also Jefferson Parish, 466 U.S. at 45, 104 S.Ct. at 1575 (O'Connor, 
J., concurring) (""Exclusive dealing arrangements are independently subject to scrutiny under § 1 of the Sherman Act, and are 
also analyzed under the Rule of Reason."")  [**202] (citing Tampa Elec. Co., 365 U.S. at 333-35, 81 S.Ct. at 631-32)."
377,27," Section 1 of the Sherman Act, which proscribes ""[e]very contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, 
in restraint of trade or commerce,"" 15 U.S.C. § 1 and Section 2 of the Sherman Act, which proscribes the monopolization or 
attempted monopolization of trade or commerce, 15 U.S.C. § 2, do not contain Section 3's ""on the condition"" language. 
Accordingly, the LTAs fall within the theoretical reach of those provisions. Nevertheless, appellees' Section 1 and 2 claims fail 
because appellees did not introduce sufficient evidence from which a jury could infer that the LTAs were exclusive dealing 
contracts that foreclosed competition in the marketplace."
377,28," In fact, even if the LTAs had required the OEMs to purchase a certain share but not all of their transmissions needs from 
Eaton, as the majority interprets them to do, it is still unclear whether Section 3 would have reached that agreement. See Areeda 
& Hovenkamp, Fundamentals  [**205] of Antitrust Law § 18.01c, at 18-17 (""Literally, a 'partial' exclusive dealing requirement "
378,," appears not to be covered by § 3 of the Clayton Act at all. For example, if A requires B to purchase 'at least 60 percent' of its 
gasoline needs from A, B is still free to purchase the remaining 40 percent elsewhere. As a result, there is no condition that B 
not deal in the goods of a competitor, as the statute requires. Most of the courts take this position."") (citations omitted)."
378,29," In Tampa Electric, the case most often cited for the ""practical effect"" standard, the Court considered a challenge to a 
requirements contract and ""assume[d], but d[id] not decide, that the contract [wa]s an exclusive-dealing arrangement within the 
compass of § 3."" 365 U.S. at 330, 81 S.Ct. at 629. "
379,30," LePage's and Dentsply, cases on which the majority relies, are not to the contrary. Those cases dealt not with Section 3 of the 
Clayton Act but rather with Section 2 of the Sherman Act,  [**211] which does not contain the same restrictive ""on the condition"" 
language as Section 3. Furthermore, in LePage's, we concluded that 3M's bundled rebate agreements constituted unlawful de 
facto exclusive dealing arrangements because LePage's ""introduced powerful evidence"" that its prior customers refused to meet 
with LePage's' sales representatives, refused to discuss purchasing LePage's products for ""the next three years,"" and 3M 
offered bonus rebates to its customers upon achieving sole-supplier status. 324 F.3d at 158. And in Dentsply, we concluded that 
a provision that Dentsply imposed on its dealers that actually prohibited the dealers from adding its competitors' tooth lines as 
part of their product offering amounted to exclusive dealing. 399 F.3d at 193. Here, as explained below, appellees fell woefully 
short of introducing evidence that the LTAs induced anything approaching actual exclusivity."
379,31," See, e.g., Barry Wright Corp., 724 F.2d at 229, 237 (observing that potential foreclosure effect of volume discount 
requirements contract between manufacturer, who had 83% to 94% market share, and purchaser of mechanical snubbers was 
50% where purchaser's snubber purchases represented 50% of snubber market). The distinction between these two inquiries, 
the question of Eaton's market share and the question of the LTAs' alleged foreclosure effect, is particularly critical in a case 
such as this one since prior to 1989 Eaton was the only HD transmission manufacturer and thus possessed 100% market share 
at a time before appellees contend that it engaged in any alleged anticompetitive conduct. "
380,32," Although Dr. DeRamus did not set forth explicitly in his expert report how he arrived at his foreclosure percentage or his 
arithmetic in that regard — a shocking oversight in a case that hinges on this very question — his testimony at trial illuminates 
that he relied on the market-share targets to arrive at his estimation of the LTAs' foreclosure effect, though notably he testified as 
to a different foreclosure percentage than that which he set forth in his report. See J.A. at 858 (Dr. DeRamus' testimony) 
(explaining that he arrived at his opinion of the LTAs' foreclosure effect by relying on the market-share targets and opining that 
one could take a ""simple average"" of the market-share targets to yield a 90% foreclosure rate)."
380,33," The District Court's statement in this regard was inaccurate as Volvo's LTA granted it rebates beginning at a 65% market-
share target."
380,34," The court also found significant the plaintiffs' expert failure to explain why ""price-sensitive hospitals would adhere to Tyco's 
market-share agreements when they could purchase less expensive generic sensors instead."" 592 F.3d at 997. "
381,35," The plaintiffs also alleged that Brunswick had violated Section 7 of the Clayton Act and  [**218] Section 2 of the Sherman Act, 
but the court likewise rejected these claims. See 207 F.3d at 1043, 1053, 1062. "
382,36," The majority states, without elaboration, that Eaton assured that there would be no other supplier that could fulfill the OEMs' 
needs or offer a lower price. I note first that it is an undisputed fact that when Meritor entered into the joint venture with ZF AG at 
a time prior to any allegation of anticompetitive conduct by Eaton, Meritor did not offer a full product line of HD truck 
transmissions. Thereafter, ZFM explicitly identified its lack of  [**224] a full product line as a barrier to its market success and yet 
it did not develop a full product line. There is no evidence that Eaton somehow prevented either Meritor or later ZFM from 
developing a full product line. Furthermore, there is no evidence in the record indicating that Eaton prevented ZFM from offering 
more attractive discounts to capture Eaton's business and there is no evidence that other firms tried to enter the HD truck 
transmission market but were thwarted by Eaton."
382,37," I recognize that appellees contend that ""[f]ar from offering low prices to seek competitive advantages . . . Eaton broke the price 
mechanism, so that ZFM could not compete even by offering discounts or other incentives notwithstanding that ZFM had a 
better product."" Appellees' br. at 44. But appellees' assessment of their product does not establish that the truck purchasers — 
the entities that actually made the ultimate decision as to which transmission to select for their trucks — would make the same 
assessment. Indeed, some of the evidence suggests that both OEMs and truck purchasers held the opinion that overall Meritor's 
products were inferior to Eaton's, and Meritor does not point to evidence foreclosing  [**225] the possibility that its relatively 
unfavorable reputation in that regard persisted despite the emergence of ZF Meritor and thereby tainted truck purchasers' view 
of the FreedomLine. Moreover, even if the truck purchasers had come to the same conclusion as appellees regarding the 
FreedomLine's technical superiority, appellees' complaint holds no force as the purchasers' were at all times free to act on that 
opinion by selecting the FreedomLine for their trucks. Nevertheless, it is clear from the record that other factors beyond possible 
technical superiority, including such considerations as price, service, and availability of the product, could motivate a purchaser 
in making its decision as to the most advantageous transmission for it to purchase. Lest this fact be doubted I merely need to 
point out that consumers regularly purchase inexpensive automobiles even though more highly-priced automobiles might be 
technically better. Overall, the point remains that if ZFM was an equally efficient competitor the LTAs simply did not preclude it 
from competing with Eaton and did not foreclose competition in any portion of the market, and thus a jury verdict based on a 
contrary conclusion simply  [**226] could not survive Eaton's motion for judgment as a matter of law. "
383,38," The majority appears to hang its hat to some extent on the notion that even if the OEMs did not actually face the threat of 
losing Eaton as a supplier they believed they might and that belief drove their compliance with the LTAs. While, as noted, there 
is scant evidence, indeed, for the proposition that the OEMs' efforts to meet the market-share targets was driven by such a "
384,," belief, that belief, if unfounded as it was here, does not support the majority's repeated statements to the effect  [**231] that 
Eaton actually coerced the OEMs into entering the LTAs and meeting the targets."
384,39," Appellees contend that the OEMs did not want to enter the LTAs and did so only in response to Eaton's coercion by citing to 
testimony that in fact weakens their case. In this regard, appellees rely on a Volvo representative's testimony that it entered into 
the LTA with Eaton because ZFM did not have a full product line and thus Volvo would require Eaton's products even if it 
entered into an LTA with ZFM but if Eaton was not its standard  [**234] partner it would not provide favorable pricing to Volvo. 
See J.A. at 522; see also J.A. 2098 (noting that Eaton would not provide favorable pricing to Volvo if it selected ZFM as its 
partner). In part for this reason, it elected to enter the LTA with Eaton. In business as in life we rarely are presented with a perfect option. The fact that long-term supply agreements with ZFM and 
Eaton each had their respective advantages and disadvantages is hardly surprising and that Eaton would not have granted an 
OEM the generous discounts its LTA provided if it selected ZFM as its primary supplier is likewise not exactly an astonishing 
revelation. That the OEMs had to weigh these factors in deciding whether to enter into an LTA with Eaton hardly amounts to 
coercion."
384,40," In their brief, appellees point to the testimony of two OEM representatives who testified to the hardly surprising fact that they 
would have preferred upfront price cuts with no strings attached as opposed to conditional market-share targets but  [**236] that 
the OEMs entered the agreements because they nonetheless offered the best prices. See J.A. at 415-16 (deposition testimony 
of International representative) (stating that International preferred to have upfront discounts ""in price"" but ""if a supplier is willing 
to offer [it] rebates"" it would take that option if it believed it could meet the conditions for those rebates); see id. at 525 "
385,," (deposition testimony of Volvo representative) (stating that during LTA negotiations Volvo ""wanted no"" market-share targets but 
it agreed to the 68% target because it believed it could achieve that target and it ""wanted the savings and the equalization, and 
the rebates""). That the OEMs would have preferred that Eaton simply cut its prices is hardly surprising. Customers faced with a 
buy one at full price and get one for 50% off deal likely would prefer to have the option of buying one item for 50% off. Yet, in the 
same way that the customer who purchases the two items to receive the discount on one cannot be said to have been ""coerced"" 
into that transaction, the OEMs' preference for unconditional price cuts hardly can be used as evidence that the terms of the 
LTAs were ""unfavorable"" to them, much  [**237] less so ""unfavorable"" as to warrant the inference that the OEMs must have 
entered them as a product of coercion."
385,41," Of course, the lack of coercion associated with the LTAs is significant. While coercion is not ""an essential element of every 
antitrust claim,"" it is an important consideration where the relevant market players adopt their own business practices 
 [**238] and the parties ""freely entered into exclusive contracts."" Race Tires, 614 F.3d at 78. "
387,42," Although I conclude that the LTAs did not foreclose competition in any portion of the market, if as the majority concludes, the 
LTAs did foreclose competition in the market, that alleged foreclosure effect necessarily was diminished by the fact that the 
LTAs at most blocked only one avenue of reaching the end-users, i.e., the truck purchasers. Component part manufacturers, 
including ZFM, can and do advertise directly to truck purchasers and are able to offer discounts directly to those consumers as 
an incentive for them to select their parts from their data books, and truck purchasers were at all times free to select appellees' 
products."
387,43," The majority states that the procompetitive justifications of the LTAs are diminished by the fact that no OEM asked Eaton to be 
a sole supplier. My response to that assertion is as simple as remarking once more that the LTAs did not by their terms or by 
their effect make Eaton a sole supplier for any of the OEMs. "
391,44," Thus, as the majority notes, in an email exchange between Eaton and Freightliner representatives a Freightliner 
representative stated that its LTA with Eaton required it to price ZFM's products at a $200 premium. Yet, Freightliner's LTA did 
not require that Freightliner price ZFM's products at a premium; it simply required that Eaton's products be the lowest-priced 
option. In light of the silence of Freightliner's LTA as to this issue, I can interpret this exchange only to mean that Freightliner 
 [**261] had elected to price Eaton's products preferentially by imposing the $200 premium on ZFM's products. Likewise, it 
appears that International and PACCAR may have imposed charges on customers who selected ZFM's products but neither 
their respective LTA nor Eaton itself required them to do so. In fact, as noted, at least in regard to International, there is evidence 
in the record that suggests that the data book price increases for ZFM's transmissions were a product of International's 
realization in 2002 that its current price for ZFM's products did not reflect accurately the cost of that product to International. See 
J.A. at 3727 (e-mail from Paul D. Barkus, International, to Galynn Skelnik, International (Jan. 11, 2002)) (proposing that 
International increase ZFM's list prices to bring them ""in line with where they should be""). "
392,45," I have not overlooked the fact that International's LTA required it to list Eaton's transmissions exclusively. Yet, International 
continued to list ZFM's manual transmissions, and it is thus not apparent whether its decision not to list ZFM's automated and 
automated mechanical transmissions is attributable to the LTA. Regardless, International's failure to list the FreedomLine, 
standing alone, did not deprive truck purchasers of access to the FreedomLine because truck purchasers were at all times free 
to specify the use of the FreedomLine transmission. Furthermore, it is important to note that HD truck purchasers in many cases 
were sophisticated customers in the HD truck market that were aware that ZFM's transmissions were available. Though I 
recognize that some purchasers likely were small operators perhaps owning only one HD truck who may have had limited 
knowledge of the differences in available transmissions, certainly the large purchasers, i.e., big trucking companies, 
 [**266] would have been more knowledgeable with respect to available transmissions. In any event, we are, after all, not 
dealing with consumers buying motor vehicles for their personal use. The transmissions involved here were installed in vehicles 
intended for commercial use, and the owners did not acquire the vehicles to go to the grocery store."
392,46," Even if a plaintiff establishes under Section 2 that ""monopoly power exists"" and that ""the exclusionary conduct . . . ha[s] an 
anti-competitive effect,"" ""the monopolist still retains a defense of business justification."" Dentsply, 399 F.3d at 187; Concord 
Boat, 207 F.3d at 1062 (""A Section 2 defendant's proffered business justification is the most important factor in determining 
whether its challenged conduct is not competition on the merits.""); Stearns Airport Equip. Co., 170 F.3d at 522 (""The key factor 
courts have analyzed in order to determine whether challenged conduct is or is not competition on the merits is the proffered 
business justification for the act.""). As with appellees' Section 3 and Section 1 claim, Eaton's valid business  [**268] justifications 
for the LTAs undermines the notion that the LTAs constituted competition on some basis other than the merits in violation of 
Section 2. "
393,47," I recognize that as the majority points out, certain OEM representatives speculated that the LTAs damaged significantly ZFM's 
business and may have caused its ultimate demise. As I have stated above, it is beyond peradventure to say that ""[t]he antitrust 
laws . . . were enacted for 'the protection of competition not competitors.'"" Brunswick, 429 U.S. at 488, 97 S.Ct. at 697 
 [**273] (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); see also Virgin Atl. Airways, 257 F.3d at 259 (""[W]hat the antitrust laws 
are designed to protect is competitive conduct, not individual competitors.""). Even if the LTAs negatively affected ZFM's 
business, that circumstance is not the salient inquiry in an antitrust case. The pivotal question is whether the LTAs negatively 
affected competition — not a particular competitor — in the marketplace, and for the reasons I have recited above, they could 
not be found to have done that. "
394,48," Of course, every decision we make is serious business and I do not imply otherwise. However, particularly in light of the 
current economic climax, the reasoning of a precedential opinion with such obvious economic repercussions is crucial. "

412,2," Although the complaints differ in the number of collective actions alleged, the Court notes that the allegations regarding the 
actions at issue in these motions are substantively similar. For instance, the Kroger Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants' ""100 
percent rule"" constituted a separate collective action, while the Winn-Dixie Plaintiffs allege that rule was part of a larger action 
involving certified eggs."
412,3," The Kraft Plaintiffs allege that similar supply reductions occurred two other times in 2004 and 2005. See Kraft Cmplt., ¶ 7. "

415,5, The SAC contains certain allegations that arguably suggest that Sparboe may not have joined the conspiracy.
415,6," By way of contrast, UEP documents pertaining to cage size guidelines arguably are integral to the Plaintiffs' complaints. 
However, Sparboe does not rely on such documents in its motions to dismiss. "
416,7," Chick hatch ""is the process of birthing chicks which eventually become egg-laying hens."" Id., ¶ 83."
416,8," In its briefing, Sparboe claims that the Plaintiffs fail to allege that it agreed to not add capacity  [**19] to its existing production 
facilities. However, the Plaintiffs all allege that Sparboe not only agreed to increase cage sizes through chick hatch reduction, 
but that the Defendants who agreed to this scheme also agreed ""not to add capacity."" Kroger Cmplt., ¶¶ 138-39, 154; Supervalu 
Cmplt., ¶¶ 130-31, 146; Publix Cmplt., ¶¶ 130-31, 146; Winn-Dixie Cmplt., ¶¶ 99, 195, 198, 200; Kraft Cmplt., ¶¶ 7D, 57; Giant 
Eagle Cmplt., ¶¶ 47, 143-44."
416,9," The Court recognizes that the Kroger Plaintiffs allege that, following its adoption of the chick hatch reduction guidelines, 
Sparboe resigned from the UEP and was not listed as a certified egg producer by the UEP because it chose to have fewer than 
100 percent of its eggs comply with UEP guidelines. See id., ¶¶ 154, 159, 169. However, these allegations do not undercut the 
inference that Sparboe initially joined the conspiracy and remained in it for a time by agreeing to a program of chick hatch 
reduction, a program which lacked a legitimate business purpose. "
417,10," The Court notes that Sparboe seems to admit as much, as it analyzes all three complaints collectively in its briefing. "
418,11," According to the Winn-Dixie Complaint, Sparboe subsequently stopped participating in the UEP's certified egg program and 
decided to not implement UEP animal welfare guidelines at all of its facilities. See id., ¶¶ 230, 316. However, the complaint 
plausibly suggests that Sparboe participated in the conspiracy prior to taking these actions. HN14[
] While a complaint ""'must 
allege that each individual defendant joined the conspiracy and played some role in it,'"" it need not allege that each defendant 
was involved in every aspect of the conspiracy. See Flat Panel, 586 F. Supp. 2d at 1117 (emphasis supplied) (quoting Elec. 
Carbon, 333 F. Supp. 2d at 311-12); see also Processed Egg Prods., 821 F. Supp. 2d at 742 (""[T]here is no requirement that 
allegations pertaining to one defendant mirror those against other defendants  [**27] in terms of specific conduct or the 'quantity' 
of alleged 'bad acts.'"")"
418,12," The Court notes that the Winn-Dixie Plaintiffs allege that Sparboe participated in the same egg export scheme discussed by 
the Kroger Plaintiffs. See Winn-Dixie Cmplt., ¶ 99. However, the Winn-Dixie Complaint alleges that Sparboe left the export 
program in 2005, id., ¶ 329,  [**28] and fails to allege that Sparboe was required to reimburse USEM members who exported 
eggs at a loss, id., ¶ 330. Moreover, like the Kroger Complaint, the Winn-Dixie Complaint leaves open the possibility that 
Sparboe limited its participation in the program to profitable exports, and many of its allegations regarding foreign egg prices 
postdate Sparboe's exit from the USEM export program. See id., ¶¶ 335, 337, 344, 349. "
419,13," As with the previously discussed complaints, the Kraft Complaint fails to allege that the USEM program solely involved 
unprofitable exports, and thus leaves open the possibility that Sparboe limited its participation in the program to exports that did 
not involve losses. See id., ¶ 142."
419,14," The Kraft Complaint also alleges that Sparboe participated in unspecified supply reduction programs. As thus alleged, the 
Court can neither determine which programs the complaint refers to nor conclude that Sparboe's alleged participation in such 
programs suggests that it joined the conspiracy. Therefore, the Court will not rely on this vague allegation. See Coulter v. 
Allegheny Cnty. Bar Ass'n, No. 12-2988, 496 Fed. Appx. 167, 2012 U.S. App. LEXIS 19217, at *5 (3d Cir. Sept. 13, 2012)

stage."")."
419,15," Giant Eagle also alleges that Sparboe violated the Ohio Valentine Act. Id., ¶¶ 231-35. Because Sparboe's motion contains no 
discussion of this alleged state-law violation, the Court will not consider whether Giant Eagle adequately states a claim against "
420,," Sparboe under Ohio law. See In re Processed Egg Prods. Antitrust Litig., No. 08-md-2002, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 57846, 2012

Prior to its dismissal, ETSI filed a Motion to Dismiss arguing, in part, that there were outstanding ripeness and standing issues.

424,6," 3GPP argues that any allegations regarding its alleged failure to supervise its members would constitute, at most, a possible 
breach of contract or a negligence claim, but not a conspiracy claim under the Sherman Act. (3GPP's Mem. Law Support Mot. to 
Dismiss at 11.) While TruePosition does argue that 3GPP failed to supervise,  [**11] it is TruePosition's claims pertaining to the 
Corporate Defendants' acts as agents of 3GPP with its apparent authority that are the focus and deciding factors of whether the 
Amended Complaint plausibly alleges an antitrust conspiracy claim against 3GPP."
424,7," Using the Restatement (Second) of Agency § 8 (1957), the Hydrolevel Court defined ""apparent authority"" as ""'the power to

438,3," Plaintiffs' claims based on Defendants' affirmative misrepresentations also fail because Plaintiff does not allege ever seeing 
any of the alleged statements on the website; indeed, he does not even allege that the statements were present on the website 
at the time of his purchase. Further, his only statement of reliance on Defendants' conduct is entirely conclusory in nature—it 
does not allege with any particularity how Plaintiff relied on Defendants' representations, nor does it allege why Plaintiff would 
have acted differently without those representations. In short, Plaintiff does not allege that Defendants' alleged 
misrepresentations  [**30] influenced his decision to purchase his computer in any way. But see Kwikset Corp. v. Superior 
Court, 51 Cal. 4th 310, 322, 120 Cal. Rptr. 3d 741, 246 P.3d 877 (2011) (noting that, to have standing to bring a claim under the 
UCL or FAL, a named plaintiff must ""(1) establish a loss or deprivation of money or property sufficient to qualify as injury in fact, 
i.e., economic injury, and (2) show that that economic injury was the result of, i.e., caused by, the unfair business practice or 
false advertising that is the gravamen of the claim.""); see also In re Tobacco II Cases, 46 Cal. 4th 298, 326, 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d 559, 
207 P.3d 20 (2009) (holding that a consumer suing a business under the ""fraud"" prong of the UCL must show actual reliance on 
the alleged misrepresentation, rather than a mere factual nexus between the business's conduct and the consumer's injury); see 
also Bower v. AT & T Mobility, LLC, 196 Cal. App. 4th 1545, 1556, 127 Cal. Rptr. 3d 569 (2011) (""[P]laintiffs in a CLRA action 
[must] show not only that a defendant's conduct was deceptive but that the deception caused them harm."") (internal quotation 
marks and citation omitted). "
440,4," Contrary to Defendants' argument in footnote 5 of the Motion, Plaintiff is not prevented from amending the complaint to include 
a request for CLRA damages. See Cal. Civ. Code § 1782(d) (stating that, contrary to the 30 day notice requirement which is a 
prerequisite for suits for damages, an action for injunctive relief may be amended without leave of court to include a request for 
damages thirty days after compliance with the notice provision); see also Morgan v. AT&T Wireless Services, Inc., 177 Cal. App. 
4th 1235, 1261, 99 Cal. Rptr. 3d 768 (2009) (holding that, even where notice is not provided before CLRA damages are sought, 
dismissal with prejudice is not required, and the prayer for damages may be reinstated as soon as notice has been provided and 
30 days have elapsed without cure). "
442,1, Pine State accordingly has been removed from the case caption. See M.R. Civ. P. 17(a). 
444,2," Labatt cites 1 M.R.S. § 71(9-A) (2011), which provides that in construction of Maine statutes, ""'shall' and 'must' are terms of 
equal weight that indicate a mandatory duty, action or requirement,"" but that provision only applies to ""laws enacted or language 
changed by amendment after December 1, 1989."" The use of ""shall"" in section 1457(2) predates 1989. Nevertheless, the Law 
Court has consistently held that the word ""shall"" should be construed as ""must"" for the purpose of sustaining or enforcing an 
existing right. Me. Sch. Admin. Dist. No. 37 v. Pineo, 2010 ME 11, ¶ 18, 988 A.2d 987; Rogers v. Brown, 135 Me. 117, 118-19,

445,4," In Eastern I, the Law Court interpreted the prior version of the Wholesale Act, 28 M.R.S.A. §§ 665-79 (Supp. 1986), which was 
repealed and recodified at 28-A M.R.S.A. §§ 1451-65 (Supp. 1987). See P.L. 1987, ch. 45, §§A, 3-4 (effective Sept. 29, 1989). 
The substance of the provisions cited in Eastern I, however, have not changed. "
451,1," Only MERS and Fannie Mae moved to dismiss, so the Court's use of the term ""Defendants"" herein refers to only those two 
entities unless otherwise specified. "
452,2, The Court GRANTS Defendants' unopposed Request for Judicial Notice. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 201. 
454,3," Section 2932.5 states: ""Where a power to sell real property is given to a mortgagee, or other encumbrancer, in an instrument 
intended to secure the payment of money, the power is part of the security and vests in any person who by assignment becomes 
entitled to payment of the money secured by the instrument. The power of sale may be exercised by the assignee if the 
assignment is duly acknowledged and recorded."" "
456,4, There is no subsection (f) in Penal Code section 532. The Court assumes Plaintiff intended to cite section 532(a). 
458,5," Defendants invoke the common interest privilege under California Civil Code section 47(c)(1) to argue that they are immune 
from IIED liability for actions during the foreclosure process. See Cal. Civ. Code § 2924(d); Kachlon v. Markowitz, 168 Cal. App. 
4th 316, 340, 85 Cal. Rptr. 3d 532 (2008). HN10[
] However, the privilege in section 2924(d) applies to actions taken by a trustee or a beneficiary acting as a trustee in exercising the power of sale in a Deed of Trust. See Kachlon, 168 Cal. App. 4th at 
344-45. ETS was the trustee that recorded the Notice of Default here, not MERS or Fannie Mae, so it appears this privilege 
would not apply to MERS or Fannie Mae. "
470,1," The Court notes that the Convention and FAA Chapter 2 would apply regardless of the parties agreement because Section 202 
of the FAA  [*8] provides that the Convention governs all arbitral awards when they arise out of a legal relationship that is 
commercial in nature and that is not entirely domestic in scope. 9 U.S.C. § 202; Ministry of Def. of Islamic Republic of Iran v. 
Gould, Inc. (""Gould""), 887 F.2d 1357, 1362 (9th Cir. 1989). That situation is present in this case. "
471,2," Similar to the cases before our sister courts in this circuit, the decision to adopt and apply the Second Circuit's reasoning is 
somewhat academic because the outcome is the same whether the court applies the standards set forth under the Convention 
or in Chapter I of the FAA. ESCO Corp., 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46460, 2011 WL 1625815, at *9 (""In any event, the court's 
resolution of whether the defenses under Chapter I of the FAA are available in addition to those under the Convention is not "
472,," critical to the outcome here.""); La Pine, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 41172, 2008 WL 2168914, at *6 (""Ultimately . . . the answer to the 
question presented is perhaps academic because . . . the outcome is the same regardless of whether the court applies the 
standards set forth under Article V of the Convention or the standards set forth in Chapter I of the FAA.""); see Kaliroy Produce 
Co, Inc., 730 F. Supp. 2d at 1047 (finding no manifest disregard of the law under 9 U.S.C. § 10(a)). "
473,3," The Court notes that the assertions for a finding of a monopoly made in Defendants' motion, Dkt. # 18, are indistinguishable 
from the assertions made to, and rejected by, the arbitrator during the arbitration, see Resp'ts' Arbitration Closing Br., Dkt. # 22, 
Ex. 18 at 67-104."
473,4," The arbitrator found that The Watkins Group's 2007 Transaction with Chemco . . . benefitted that market and was not shown to create a monopoly. . 
. . None of the factual elements of a claim of monopolization was established by the evidence presented. In particular, no 
analytically valid or persuasive definition of a ""relevant  [*21] market"" was offered or established, either for use with respect 
to Respondents' antitrust defenses or counterclaims. In this regard, Respondents' evidence failed to take proper account of 
the extent to which FSR's alleged market power, allegedly based on providing one input to a product sold in a large market, "
474,," is constrained and diluted by competition from other sellers of wooden shakes, the availability of other alternatives (asphalt 
or composition shingles, clay tiles, metal roofing[,] and various other roofing products) to cedar shakes as roofing materials, 
and the realistic risk of new entrants. In addition, Chemco failed to establish that Claimants engaged in any wrongful 
exclusionary conduct to acquire or maintain any alleged monopoly power in any relevant market. In particular, . . . the 
evidence failed to establish that Claimants' pricing practices following the 2007 Transaction were in any way improper 
under the antitrust laws or indicative of possession of or improper use of monopoly power. Dkt. # 1, Ex. 1 at 13-14. And, In addition to being unsupported by the evidence offered, the antitrust counterclaim also failed because the legal elements 
necessary to establish a claim  [*22] of monopolization were not demonstrated. Based on the legal authorities submitted, 
no legally permissible definition of a ""relevant market"" was established. In addition, Chemco failed to establish, as a matter 
of law, that the conduct of Claimants challenged in the antitrust counterclaim constituted either wrongful exclusionary 
conduct or the improper acquisition or maintenance of monopoly power in any relevant market. Respondents also failed to 
establish that Claimants' pricing practices following the 2007 Transaction were indicative of possession of or improper use 
of monopoly power, or that the restrictions imposed on Chemco in the 2007 Transaction agreements violated any aspect of 
the antitrust laws. Dkt. # 1, Ex. 1 at 21-22. "
478,1," Castro Valley states in its notice of motion that it is seeking certification under both Rule 23(b)(2) and Rule 23(b)(3). See Notice 
of Motion, at 1. However, at the beginning of its discussion of the Rule 23(a) factors, it asserts that ""the proposed class satisfies 
the prerequisites of Rule 23(a) (numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy) and the requirements of Rule 23(b)(3) 
(predominance and superiority)."" See Motion at 9. Finally, in its discussion of the Rule 23(b) factors, Castro Valley states, ""[t]he 
proposed class meets all of the subsections of Section B"" (apparently referring to Rule 23(b)), and briefly refers to Rule 23(b)(1) 
(A) and (B); to Rule 23(b)(3); and to Rule 23(c)(5) — but does not mention Rule 23(b)(2). See Motion  [*7] at 23-24. "

[that] eliminates accidental fuel spillage . . . [and] reduces emissions caused by dripping, spitting, and liquid retention."" "
483,3," VST's president Glenn K. Walker states in his declaration that ""VST does not typically interact with station owners directly 
regarding the purchase of the nozzles, but in some cases it may do so;"" and that ""VST does not have a policy of distributing the 
exact same written materials to any particular station owner, nor does VST know what each individual station owner might have

496,1, Smith has filed a request for oral argument but the Court is not persuaded that oral argument would be helpful. 
498,2," The Court notes that American Building Products, L.L.C. v. Ashley Aluminum, Inc. No. 97-2976, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15612, 
1997 WL 610877 *1 (E.D. La. Oct. 1, 1997),  [*11] cited by Smith for the proposition that ""this Court has previously found that a 
claim under LUSA 51:422 is a predatory pricing scheme"" claim, and thereby an antitrust claim, is not so clear-cut. (Rec. Doc. 
184 at 2). As the Ciolino Entities correctly point out, ""Smith Drug has ...taken argument of counsel, as reported by the Court, and 
turned it into an essential element of the claim."" (Rec. Doc. 198 at 3). While no other case cited by the parties, nor found by the 
Court, establishes that all claims under the LUSA are per se antitrust claims, the Court finds that La. R.S. § 51:421 et seq. does 
contemplate predatory pricing scheme claims, which are themselves per se antitrust claims (see Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. 
Zenith Radio, 475 U.S. 574, 595, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986)) which the Louisiana Supreme Court has looked to 
federal law for guidance in the past. (See Tuban Petroleum, L.L.C. v. SIARC, Inc., 11 So. 3d 519, 523 (La. App. 4 Cir. 2009)) 
(citing Louisiana Power & Light Co. V. United Gas Pipe Line Co., 493 So.2d 1149, 1151 (La. 1986)). That said, ultimately it is the 
role of the finder of fact to determine whether first, there was a sale under cost, and then second, if so, whether this under-cost 
 [*12] sale was part of a predatory pricing scheme. Only after such a finding will the defenses asserted by Smith need to be 
addressed. "
502,1, The Court GRANTS Defendants' request for judicial notice. See Fed. R. Evid. 201. 
504,2," Section 1 provides: Persons engaged in the production of agricultural products as farmers, planters, ranchmen, dairymen, nut or fruit growers 
may act together in associations, corporate or otherwise, with or without capital stock, in collectively processing, preparing 
for market, handling, and marketing in interstate and foreign commerce, such products of persons so engaged. Such 
associations may have marketing agencies in common; and such associations and their members may make the necessary 
contracts and agreements to effect such purposes: Provided, however, That such associations are operated for the mutual 
benefit of the members thereof, as such producers, and conform to one or both of the following requirements: First. That no member of the association is allowed more than one vote because of the amount of stock or membership 
capital he may own therein, or, Second. That the association does not pay dividends on stock or membership capital in excess of 8 per centum per annum. 
And in any [*13]  case to the following: Third. That the association shall not deal in the products of nonmembers to an amount greater in value than such as are 
handled by it for members."
504,7, U.S.C. § 291 (emphasis in original). 
505,3," Because the Court finds that the Supreme Court's rejection of the proposition that the Secretary has exclusive or primary 
jurisdiction is not limited to the factual circumstances raised in Borden and in Maryland & Virginia, the Court need not evaluate at 
this time whether Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged predatory conduct, whether the cooperatives were operated for the mutual 
benefit of its members, or whether supply restraints are included in the exemption provided by Section 1 of the Capper-Volstead 
Act. As Defendants clarify in their reply, they are not seeking a ruling from this Court regarding whether their alleged conduct is 
immune from antitrust liability pursuant to Section 1 of the Capper-Volstead Act. (Reply at 1.)"
505,4," In a footnote, Defendants argue that the Supreme Court's holdings in Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC v. Billing, 551 U.S. 
264, 127 S. Ct. 2383, 168 L. Ed. 2d 145 (2007) and Verizon Communications, Inc. v. Law Offices of Curtis V. Trinko, LLP, 540 
U.S. 398, 124 S. Ct. 872, 157 L. Ed. 2d 823 (2004) ""underscore"" the point that the Court should refer this matter to the Secretary 
to make an initial jurisdictional determination. However, Credit Suisse and Verizon are inapplicable and do not support a finding 
that the Court should defer ruling pursuant to the primary jurisdiction doctrine. In Credit Suisse, the question before the Supreme 
Court was whether there was a ""plain repugnancy"" between the plaintiffs' antitrust claims and the federal securities law. Id., 551 "
506,," U.S. at 267. The Court explained that an implied repeal of the antitrust laws could be found where there is a plain repugnancy 
between the antitrust law and regulatory provisions. Id. at 271 (citing Gordon v. New York Stock Exchange, Inc., 422 U.S. 659, 
682, 95 S. Ct. 2598, 45 L. Ed. 2d 463 (1975). In determining whether there is a ""clear repugnancy"" between the securities law 
and the antitrust complaint, the Supreme Court has ""treated the following factors as critical: (1) the existence of regulatory 
authority under the securities law to supervise the activities in question; (2) evidence that the responsible regulatory entities 
exercise that authority; and (3) a resulting risk that the securities and antitrust laws, if both applicable, would produce conflicting 
guidance, requirements, duties, privileges, or standards of conduct."" Id. at 275-76. The Court further noted that it also considers 
whether ""the possible conflict affected practices that lie squarely within an area of financial market activity that the securities law 
seeks to regulate."" Id. at 276; see also id. at 285. Defendants have not demonstrated, and do not even argue, that there is a 
clear or plain repugnancy between any law and Plaintiffs' antitrust claims based upon these factors. In Verizon, the Supreme 
Court determined that an alleged breach by an incumbent telephone company under the Telecommunications Act of 1996 of its 
duty to share its network with its competitors did not state a monopoly or attempted monopoly claim under Section 2 of the 
Sherman Act. Id., 540 U.S. at 401, 410-415. Verizon is inapposite. "
507,5," Defendants also point to the fact that the Secretary is authorized, pursuant to Section 2 of the Capper-Volstead Act, to bring an 
action if he or she believes that agricultural prices have been ""unduly enhanced."" See 7 U.S.C. § 292. However, ability of the 
Secretary in certain circumstances to bring an action does not mean that the Secretary has actually set and approved of the 
over-order prices. If that were the case, the filed-rate doctrine would apply in every instance in which an agency has the ability to 
bring an action regarding prices charged. Defendants have not shown that the Secretary has exercised this procedure under the 
Capper-Volstead Act to effectively regulate and control the over-order prices to the extent necessary to implicate the filed-rate 
doctrine. "
508,6," However, the Court does note that, to the extent Plaintiffs intend to rely on a theory of fraudulent concealment, Plaintiffs have 
not plead facts in support of such a theory with sufficient particularity. If Plaintiffs seek to pursue this legal theory, they should file 
an amended complaint by no later than November 15, 2012. "
515,1," The caption says ""Segwick"" but the company spells it ""Sedgwick."" "
517,2," The plaintiffs appealed from the order granting the motion to dismiss and denying leave to amend, but they do not make any 
arguments with respect to their motion for leave to amend until their reply brief. However, in many instances, the district court 
considered the proposed amendments when analyzing the motion to dismiss, the grant of which is appealed and discussed at 
length. Therefore, to the extent the district court's motion-to-dismiss analysis relies on the proposed amendments, we will 
consider them on appeal rather than deem those arguments waived. We leave it to the parties and the district court whether 
leave to amend should be reconsidered on remand."
517,3," The plaintiffs argue that the heightened pleading standard in Twombly is inapplicable to small-scale, civil RICO cases, in which 
the discovery expenses are less than in large-scale antitrust cases. This argument is untenable. After Iqbal, we apply the 
plausibility standard across the board. 556 U.S. at 684. "
518,4," The plaintiffs also argue that, by invoking Rule 11(b)(3), they should be entitled to discovery before their complaint is dismissed 
for lack of particularly under Rule 9(b). See Brown v. Cassens Transp. Co., 546 F.3d 347, 356 n.4 (6th Cir. 2008) (""Brown I"") 
(citing cases but declining to decide the issue), cert. denied, 558 U.S. 1085, 130 S. Ct. 795, 175 L. Ed. 2d 575 (2009). Because 
we hold that the plaintiffs have adequately pleaded a RICO claim, we again decline to resolve this issue."
518,5," The concurrence makes the unsubstantiated assertion that in a worker's compensation program, employees relinquish the right 
to litigate all claims in exchange for no-fault insurance coverage. However, Howard Delivery Service v. Zurich American 
Insurance Co., 547 U.S. 651, 126 S. Ct. 2105, 165 L. Ed. 2d 110 (2006), the case upon which the concurrence relies, merely 
stands for the proposition that worker's compensation programs protect the employer from common-law tort claims related to the 
alleged workplace injury. Id. at 662-63. Here, the plaintiffs do not seek to litigate, or relitigate, tort-based workplace-injury claims. 
Rather, the plaintiffs are challenging what they allege to be a fraudulent administrative process by which one seeks to 
 [**14] make a worker's compensation claim to Sedgwick. HN6[
] A civil RICO claim not only includes elements distinct from those in a common-law tort claim, but also must withstand heightened scrutiny under Rule 9(b) pleading standards. In sum, the 
worker's compensation program does not offer complete immunity to an employer, and this action is not a second bite at the 
apple, as the concurrence intimates. "
519,6," The concurrence contends that Brown II incorrectly enables an employee's workplace injury to satisfy the RICO requirement 
that the injury be to business or property. This assertion misconstrues the holding in Brown II in order to manufacture a 
disagreement on an issue not before this court. There is no dispute that HN9[
] an allegation of workplace injuries is insufficient 
by itself to support a civil RICO claim. Here, as in Brown II, the plaintiffs allege a property interest in bringing a worker's 
compensation claim free of fraud—i.e., they allege a devaluation of a statutory expectancy of worker's compensation benefits. 
 [**16] This theory of liability as pleaded by the plaintiffs is entirely distinct from a run-of-the-mill tort claim in which a plaintiff 
seeks damages apart from worker's compensation based on a personal injury at work."
519,7," It is unclear from where the concurrence derives its statement that we would use as evidence of entitlement to damages the 
fact that an employee had settled his or her claim with the employer. In fact, HN11[
] Brown II restricts plaintiffs from 
recovering damages under a civil RICO claim that they had already received as part of the settlement agreement. 675 F.3d at 
967. "
523,8," The plaintiffs correctly state the law on this matter. The concurrence insinuates that but for Brown II, the court would not be 
bound by the principle that one can establish a civil RICO claim without establishing  [**32] the traditional elements of common-
law fraud. Even without Brown II, however, the concurrence would remain bound by this principle given the following discussion 
in Bridge v. Phoenix Bond & Indemnity Co., 553 U.S. 639, 128 S. Ct. 2131, 170 L. Ed. 2d 1012 (2008): First, as explained above, the predicate act here is not common-law fraud, but mail fraud. Having rejected petitioners' 
argument that HN21[
] reliance is an element of a civil RICO claim based on mail fraud, we see no reason to let that 
argument in through the back door by holding that the proximate-cause analysis under RICO must precisely track the 
proximate-cause analysis of a common-law fraud claim. Reliance is not a general limitation on civil recovery in tort; it is a 
specialized condition that happens to have grown up with common law fraud. That specialized condition, whether 
characterized as an element of the claim or as a prerequisite to establishing proximate causation, simply has no place in a 
remedial scheme keyed to the commission of mail fraud, a statutory offense that is distinct from common-law fraud and that 
does not require proof of reliance. Id. at 655-56 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). It is thus unclear how this court would not be bound  [**33] by this 
principle but for Brown II. "
524,9," The concurrence accuses the Brown II opinion of selectively quoting Bridge for the proposition that reliance is not always 
required in order to establish a RICO violation. Somewhat ironically, the quotation relied upon and paragraphs cited by the 
concurrence in making this point conveniently omit the contradictory surrounding text, including in one instance a clause in the 
same sentence. As any careful reader would discern, the Court in Bridge unequivocally determined that HN22[
] reliance is not 
necessary for a civil RICO claim: ""the fact that proof of reliance is often used to prove an element of the plaintiff's cause of 
action, such as the element of causation, does not transform reliance itself into an element of the cause of action."" 553 U.S. at 
659 (internal quotation marks omitted). "
526,1," The precedent opinion, Brown, 675 F.3d at 952, cites Bridge v. Phoenix Bond & Indemnity Co., 553 U.S. 639, 128 S. Ct. 2131, 
170 L. Ed. 2d 1012, (2008), for the assertion ""that civil RICO plaintiffs do not need to demonstrate reliance on defendants' 
fraudulent representations,"" and refers to the earlier opinion, Brown v. Cassens Transp. Co., 546 F.3d 347, 356-57 (6th Cir. 
2008), which analyzed that issue. To be sure, Bridge holds that first-party reliance is not required, id. at 650-54, but it also goes 
on to say that ""the plaintiff's loss must be a foreseeable result of someone's reliance on the misrepresentation,"" id. at 656 
(emphasis in the original); see also 658-59 (""[N]one of this is to say that a RICO plaintiff who alleges injury 'by reason of' a 
pattern of mail fraud can prevail without showing that someone relied on the  [**40] defendant's misrepresentations."" (emphasis 
in the original)). Neither of the Brown opinions points to any reliance by anyone or suggests that any showing of any reliance 
was ever required. In the present case, the district court declined to reach the merits of the defendants' argument ""that Plaintiffs' [sic] have failed to 
plead mail fraud, as Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that anyone was 'deceived' by Defendants [sic] actions."" Jackson v. 
Sedgwick Claims Mgmt. Servs., Inc., No. 09-11529, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22792, 2010 WL 931864, *14 n.27 (E.D. Mich. Mar. 
11, 2010). The lead opinion here offers no indication that anyone was actually deceived by any misrepresentations, but declined 
to reach this argument and ""will leave it to the district court to consider on remand."" Lead Op. at 20."
526,2," The WDCA provides for review of a disputed claim by a mediator or at a hearing before a worker's compensation magistrate, 
Mich. Comp. Laws § 418.847; provides for review of the magistrate's decision by the Workers Compensation Appellate 
Commission, § 418.859a; and provides for subsequent judicial review, § 418.861a(14). The WDCA provides that a disability insurer must pay a penalty of $50.00 per day if, in the absence of  [**42] a dispute over the 
claim, it fails to pay benefits within 30 days, though it limits the total penalty to $1500. § 418.801(2). The WDCA also provides 
that a self-insurer can lose its privilege if it ""repeatedly or unreasonably fails to pay promptly claims for compensation for which it 
shall become liable."" § 418.631(1). "
527,3," The Supreme Court held in Bridge that first-party reliance was not required to prove causation under the mail-fraud statute, but 
clarified that some reliance would be necessary to show causation: Of course, none of this [explanation that first-party reliance is unnecessary] is to say that a RICO plaintiff who alleges injury 
'by reason of' a pattern of mail fraud can prevail without showing that someone relied on the defendant's 
misrepresentations. In most cases, the plaintiff will not be able to establish even but-for causation if no one relied on the 
misrepresentation. . . . In addition, the complete absence of reliance may prevent the plaintiff from establishing proximate 
cause. Bridge, 553 U.S. 658-59 (emphasis in original; internal citation omitted). "

532,2," Atlas Brace also argues that Defendants stated that Atlas Brace could not design around patents-in-suit, but the Court is 
unable to find those allegations in the SAC and will not consider them. "

] ""At its essence, mediation is a process of negotiations facilitated by a third person(s) who assists disputants to pursue 
a mutually agreeable settlement of their conflict. In contrast to adjudicatory forms of dispute resolution -- hearings, arbitration 
and trials -- mediation is a contractarian process. The salient features of mediation are an informal process, a neutral mediator 
without authority to command a result,  [*13] [and] disputants who participate voluntarily and settle of their own accord . . ."" Alan 
Kirtley, The Mediation Privilege's Transition from Theory to Implementation: Designing a Mediation Privilege Standard to Protect

574,4," Neither in the district court nor on appeal do Miller, Lanphere, and Matheson allege a separate and distinct claim for injunctive 
or declaratory relief against the officials qua officials. See Maxwell,     F.3d    , 2012 U.S. App. LEXIS 19225, 2012 WL 4017462, 
at *11. We therefore express no opinion as to the viability of such a claim against the officials themselves. "
579,1," Defendants also highlight the fact that the Ranis Co., Inc. (""Ranis""), the class representative for the Direct Purchaser Damages 
Class, is, in part, an indirect vitamin C purchaser. Ranis is the assignee of the claims of the Graymoor Chemical Co., Inc. 
(""Graymoor""). Graymoor made direct vitamin C purchases from defendants but also made a number of purchases of vitamin C 
manufactured by defendants through two Canadian intermediary companies. "
580,2," Defendants also argue the issue underlying this motion was not apparent until expert discovery, which only concluded recently. "
581,3," The Seventh Circuit has observed that the import trade or commerce exception is not, strictly speaking, an 'exception' from the 
FTAIA. See Minn-Chem, 683 F.3d at 854. This Court adopts the term only for ease of reference. "
584,4," Plaintiffs also rely on another decision in In re TFT-LCD (Flat Panel) Antitrust Litig., No. M 07-1827, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
65037, 2010 WL 2610641 (N.D. Cal. June 28, 2010), in which the court dismissed Motorola's foreign purchaser claims under § 
6a(2). The dispute there centered on ""whether Motorola can seek to recover based on foreign-sold panels that were 
subsequently incorporated into Motorola  [**31] products that Motorola and others — but not defendants — shipped to and sold 
in the United States."" 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 65037, [WL] at * 3. This decision is inapposite because there was no way that the 
foreign injury at issue — the overcharge to Motorola's foreign affiliates — could have been proximately caused by a domestic 
effect of defendants' conduct when it was the actions of Motorola and others, rather than defendants' conduct, that brought the 
goods into U.S. commerce. Here, by contrast, it was defendants' actions that brought vitamin C into U.S. commerce. "
585,5," For this reason, defendants reliance on Howard Hess Dental Labs. Inc. v. Dentsply Int'l Inc., 424 F.3d 363 (3d Cir. 2005), is 
unavailing. Dentsply does not address the FTAIA at all, nor the domestic effects of anticompetitive conduct where the relevant 
goods are delivered into the United States. All Dentsply stands for is that plaintiffs cannot avoid the bar on indirect purchaser 
damages under the antitrust laws ""by claiming they were direct purchasers of drop shipments [shipments that were not sent 
through a dealer] when their complaint specifically alleges that they did not purchase directly from Dentsply."" Id. at 372-73. 
Dentsply's comment that ""the fact that some of the teeth are drop shipped directly from Dentsply to Plaintiffs does not affect the 
economic substance of the transaction,"" id. at 373, addressed the attempt by plaintiffs in that case to recharacterize their indirect 
purchaser claims as direct purchaser claims based solely on the delivery method even though dealers still functioned as "
586,," intermediaries. Plaintiffs here  [**37] are not attempting a similar recharacterization because some class member, whether 
foreign or domestic, purchased vitamin C directly from defendants in every instance with no intermediary. "
589,1," The Supreme Court in Medimmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., 549 U.S. 118, 127, 127 S. Ct. 764, 166 L. Ed. 2d 604 (2007), 
rejected our ""reasonable apprehension of suit"" test for declaratory judgment standing and held that the proper test is whether 
""there is a substantial controversy, between parties having adverse legal interests, of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant 
the issuance of a declaratory judgment."" See SanDisk Corp. v. STMicroelectronics, Inc., 480 F.3d 1372, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2007). 
Ritz does not claim that it could have brought a declaratory judgment action against SanDisk seeking relief under the patent 
laws. "
590,2," The Second Circuit ""decline[d] to decide whether purchaser plaintiffs per se have standing to raise Walker Process claims,"" 
and held ""only that purchaser plaintiffs have standing to raise Walker Process claims for patents that are already unenforceable 
due to inequitable conduct."" DDAVP, 585 F.3d at 691-92. The district court in this case noted  [**12] that claims of intentional 
fraud against the '338 and '517 patents had previously survived a motion for summary judgment in another case. We see no "
591,," reason to limit the scope of Walker Process standing to cases in which the patents have been ""tarnished"" in another proceeding. 
Walker Process contains no such limitation, and applying such a requirement would have the undesirable effect of subjecting 
injured parties' claims to the litigation strategies of others. It would also be likely to generate unproductive wrangling over what 
counts as a sufficiently ""tarnished"" patent to support a Walker Process claim. "
596,1," The Court notes that Plaintiff seeks leave to amend his Complaint if the Court grants Defendants' Motion. Upon review, the 
Court finds no reason to believe the defects discussed above can be cured by amendment. "
609,1," The nine Named DPPs are: Arch Electronics, Inc.; Crago d/b/a Dash Computers, Inc.; Electronic Design Company; Meijer, Inc. 
and Meijer Distribution, Inc.; Nathan Muchnick, Inc.; Orion Home Systems, LLC; Radio & TV Equipment, Inc.; Royal Data 
Services, Inc.; and Studio Spectrum, Inc. The Named DPPs are only nine of the thirteen members of the entire putative DPP 
class. As explained in Section IV.A infra, the term ""direct purchaser"" is a misnomer as applied to the Named DPPs, who are 
actually indirect purchasers. However, the Court uses the term ""DPP"" to stay consistent with past orders and to differentiate the 
Named DPPs from a putative class called the indirect purchaser plaintiffs, as well as from the direct action plaintiffs."
609,2," On June 16, 2008, the Court appointed the Honorable Charles A. Legge, United States District Judge (Retired), as a Special 
Master to assist the Court with this litigation. ECF No. 302."
609,3," The Court received the Named DPPs' brief in chambers under seal. See ECF Nos. 1271 (motion to seal), 1276 (notice of errata 
and amended motion to seal), 1300 (order granting amended motion to seal)."
609,4," Though the DPPs have sued entire corporate families and often refer to them by a single name, a particular corporate entity 
within a family may be dedicated to selling FPs rather than CRTs. See In re Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) Antitrust Litig., 738 F. 
Supp. 2d 1011, 1019-1020 (N.D. Cal. 2010) (Conti, J.). "
611,5," In Hanover Shoe, the Supreme Court barred the defensive use of a pass-through theory, thereby allowing antitrust plaintiffs to 
recover damages in excess of their actual losses. Hanover Shoe, Inc. v. United Shoe Mach. Corp., 392 U.S. 481, 491-94, 88 S. 
Ct. 2224, 20 L. Ed. 2d 1231 (1968). Illinois Brick extended the holding of Hanover Shoe to the offensive context. E.g., Del. 
Valley, 523 F.3d at 1120 (citing Illinois Brick, 431 U.S. at 728). "
612,6," Before ATM Fee, the case law hinted at the possible existence of a fourth exception that would apply when ""there is no realistic 
possibility that the direct purchaser will sue."" 686 F.3d at 749 (quoting Freeman v. San Diego Ass'n of Realtors, 322 F.3d 1133, 
1145-46 (9th Cir. 2003)). The ATM Fee panel explained, however, that Freeman did not create a fourth exception. It simply 
restated the ownership and control exception already established by Royal Printing. See id. at 756. "
614,7," It has been suggested that Royal Printing is distinguishable from this case because the Royal Printing plaintiffs purchased 
price-fixed paper while the Named DPPs never purchased a price-fixed CRT from anyone. See Defs' Brief at 20; R&R at 10, 11. 
The difficulty with this position is that the Royal Printing plaintiffs did not purchase price-fixed paper. They paid the wholesale 
price, which was set by market forces. See Royal Printing, 621 F.2d at 324  [**70] (plaintiffs bought only at wholesale), 326 n.4 
(""[T]he wholesalers' pricing decisions are determined by market forces . . . .""). The Royal Printing plaintiffs, like the Named DPPs 
here, were indirect purchasers. Ninth Circuit cases distinguish between, on the one hand, an overcharge directly set by and paid 
to the conspiracy and, on the other, a price paid farther along in the distribution chain which includes a passed-on overcharge. 
E.g., ATM Fee, 686 F.3d at 754 (distinguishing between direct payment of the price set by conspiring defendants and indirect 
payment of that price via pass-through, the latter being ""merely 'fixed' in some broad sense""). Making antitrust standing depend 
on whether a plaintiff bought the price-fixed product -- that is, whether plaintiff was a direct purchaser -- would wipe out the Royal 
Printing exception. "
615,8," The Court notes that Illinois Brick itself set forth a rule aimed at preventing multiple recoveries even though ""[t]he potential of 
possible multiple recoveries [was] not present in [that] case."" 431 U.S. at 763 n.22 (Brennan, J., dissenting). "
631,1," Dell alleges only direct purchaser price-fixing claims under Section One of the Sherman Act. The direct purchaser plaintiff class 
action lawsuit, filed on December 12, 2006, tolled Dell's claims. Dell has alleged that its claims  [*50] relating to conduct 
occurring before December 12, 2002, are timely because defendants fraudulently concealed the alleged price-fixing conspiracy, 
and Dell did not discover and could not have discovered through the exercise of reasonable diligence the existence of the 
conspiracy until December 2006. "
632,2," Dell has filed a motion for sanctions against defendants, in which Dell contends that defendants engaged in misconduct in 
securing Mr. Korman's deposition. Dell requests as sanctions, inter alia, that the Court bar the use of Mr. Korman's testimony in 
motion practice or trial and that the Court strike defendants' statute of limitations defense on the basis of fraudulent concealment. 
The sanctions motion is currently pending before the Special Master. In ruling on the current motion, the Court assumes that Mr. 
Korman's testimony is generally admissible. "
646,1," This motion to dismiss arises out of two consolidated cases. Laumann v. National Hockey League, et al., No. 12 Civ. 1817 
involves professional hockey telecasting, and Garber v. Office of the Commissioner of Baseball, et al., No. 12 Civ. 3704,

693,9," Defendants cite several cases addressing what it means to be prepared to enter a relevant market. See D.E. 20 at 18-20. 
While the cases cited by Defendants do, indeed, define a ""prospective participant in a market"" as one who ""has taken substantial 
demonstrable steps to enter an industry and is thwarted in that purpose by antitrust violations,"" see, e.g., In re Dual-Deck Video 
Cassette Recorder Antitrust Litig., 11 F.3d 1460, 1464-65 (9th Cir. 1993) — a definition that would not include CoreLogic under 
the allegations set forth in the Complaint — these discussions appear in the context of the cited cases' analyses of antitrust 
standing, not of the sufficiency of allegations pertaining to the second element of a Section 2 claim for maintaining a monopoly. 
Consequently, the Court does not rely on them in its analysis of whether Defendants' conduct violated the antitrust laws. See 
CBC Cos., Inc., 561 F.3d at 571  [*60] (noting HN16[
] the distinction between the concepts of antitrust injury and antitrust 
standing). "
695,10," While Koster involved a derivative shareholder's action that is not entirely analogous to the class action here, the plaintiffs in 
this case nonetheless share certain characteristics of the class in Koster. For example, as in Koster, where the shareholders 
were from all over the country, here, the putative class members include mortgage CRAs who are also located nationwide, 
according to both parties. Under the facts as alleged in the Complaint, each such putative class member would have an equal 
claim to venue in its state of residence. Thus, as in Koster, the instant matter may have properly  [*68] been filed in numerous, 
different states."
695,11, This implicates the fourth venue-transfer consideration. 
696,12," At least one court has used as the location of the operative facts the place where it determined illegal conduct that was denied

716,1," As used in this Memorandum, ""chocolate confectionary products"" and ""chocolate candy products"" refer to single and King sized 
chocolate bars, and other mass-produced chocolate products manufactured by Hershey, Mars, and Nestlé and packaged for "
717,," sale to various retail customers. Examples of some of Defendants' more popular items are Hershey's Milk Chocolate Bar®, 
M&M's®, and Nestlé Crunch Bar®."
717,2," A product is considered fungible and commodity-like when price is the determinative factor in the purchasing decision, as 
compared to other characteristics such as brand preference. (Doc. 999, at 27)."
717,3," The parties do not specifically define ""trade spend"". However, the court finds the explanation provided by Direct Purchasers' 
expert, Dr. James T. McClave, instructive: ""Each of the defendants spends some of its revenues on promotional activities. These 
promotional dollars are known in this industry as 'trade spend.' Manufacturers engage in trade spending in order to obtain certain 
benefits for themselves, including product placement and display, product promotions, and increased advertising of their 
products designed to increase the volume of sales. Defendants make trade spend payments to their merchant customers in 
exchange for the customer's carrying out specified promotional arrangements."" (Doc. 999-1, at 51). The following are typical 
trade spend programs: (1) ""Every Day Low Pricing,"" which may be provided to retailers who offer a consistently low price; (2) 
""Brand Specific Promotion,"" which promotes a certain brand, for example, by  [**43] displaying it in the front of the store; (3) 
""End-Cap Fees With Price Promotion,"" for customers who set up end-cap displays with an accompanying price discount (an 
example of an end-cap display is a chocolate product which is featured at the end of a grocery aisle); and, (4) ""Combination 
Programs,"" for combining sales of chocolate products with an accompanying item. (Doc. 1028, at 20; see also Doc. 1087, at 16-
23). "
718,4," Suffice it to say that the court's analysis would have been materially different had the definition of the  [**44] Direct Purchaser 
Class remained as initially proposed in the Consolidated Class Action Complaint. (See Doc. 418, ¶ 37)."
718,5," The court notes that the briefing on Defendants' motions in limine concluded after the hearing on class certification. In addition, 
Defendants' expert, Dr. John H. Johnson, IV, submitted a rebuttal declaration on January 6, 2012 (Doc. 1129), subsequent to 
the hearing. "
719,6," The court notes that Defendants filed motions to exclude the opinions of Dr. Tollison and Dr. McClave prior to the hearing on 
class certification. (See Doc. 1063; Doc. 1066)."
719,7," The Supreme Court recently granted certiorari in Behrend on the following issue: ""Whether a district court may certify a class 
action without resolving whether the plaintiff class has introduced admissible evidence, including expert testimony, to show that 
the case is susceptible to awarding damages on a class-wide basis."" 133 S.Ct. 24, 183 L. Ed. 2d 673 (2012). "
720,8," A leading treatise on class actions states that ""as part of its rigorous analysis at the class certification stage, [a] Court should 
determine under the Daubert standard whether expert evidence is sufficiently reliable to be considered and then weigh the 
significance of expert evidence relevant to any class certification requirement."" 1 JOSEPH M. MCLAUGHLIN, MCLAUGHLIN ON 
CLASS ACTIONS § 3:14 (8th ed. 2011). Moreover, though the Supreme Court's statement in Wal-Mart was only dictum, ""it 
betray[ed] no hesitation."" Id."
720,9," At the class certification hearing, the court timely notified counsel that it intended to address Defendants' motions to exclude 
expert testimony in conjunction with the court's ruling on class certification. (Doc. 1085, at 6)."
720,10," HN4[
] Rule 702 applies generally to any expert with ""scientific, technical, or other specialized  [**54] knowledge,"" and though Daubert dealt only with scientific testimony, the Court later expanded Daubert's ""general principles"" to all subject matter 
described in Rule 702. See Kumho Tire Co., Ltd. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S. 137, 149, 119 S. Ct. 1167, 143 L. Ed. 2d 238 (1999). 
Hence, under Kumho Tire, the economic testimony offered by Drs. Tollison and McClave qualify as ""technical, or other 
specialized knowledge"" subject to the Daubert standard. "
721,11," Defendants rely on the expert report and testimony of Dr. Peter Rossi who disagrees with Dr. Tollison with regard to the 
degree of substitutability between chocolate candy products. (See Doc. 1086, at 279). Dr. Rossi asserts that chocolate candy 
products are not highly fungible, and that the product differentiating effect of branding on consumer preferences has been 
 [**58] significant. (Doc. 1032, at 7 (""Each of the major chocolate candy brands is associated with a specific type and quality of 
product and a specific consumption experience."")). Whether Dr. Tollison or Dr. Rossi is correct in their assessment of the degree of substitutability between the products produced 
by Hershey, Nestlé and Mars is a question appropriately deferred to trial on the merits of the Direct Purchasers antitrust claim. It 
does not render class certification inappropriate because, as Dr. Rossi conceded at the class certification hearing, the resolution 
of this issue will be common to the class. (Doc. 1086, p. 279 (""Q: . . . [W]hether you are right or Dr. Tollison is right [on the 
degree of substitutability between products] or it ends up somewhere in between, that is an issue that is common for each 
member of his class, is that correct? A: Yes."")). "
722,12," The court finds particular merit in Dr. Tollison's pointed clarification of the factual basis for his conclusions: Substitutability is not an absolute (either/or) but a relative term. Products can be more or less substitutable. So the fact that 
a product has some characteristics counter-indicative of substitutability (such as branding)  [**59] does not end the inquiry 
because it does not necessarily negate the presence of other characteristics that are indicative of substitutability. Moreover, 
the inquiry is not one of economic philosophy, but is a purposive inquiry. The purpose is to see if there is sufficient 
substitutability to suggest that consumers make their choices in some substantial part on the basis of price."
722,*," * * I did not conclude that these products were perfect substitutes; I concluded that they are reasonably interchangeable. The 
fact that this industry's products are differentiated along a variety of dimensions (ingredients, brand, packaging, size) does 
not mean they are not substitutes for one another. (Doc. 1048-2, at 5-8)."
722,13," The court has carefully reviewed the factual findings underpinning Dr. Tollison's opinions. The vast majority are undisputed. 
Those that are disputed, such as the commodity-like nature of the products identified in the revised description of the class 
(Kings and singles), are sufficiently supported by record references. Hence, the court adopts Dr. Tollison's factual premises for 
purposes of its Rule 23 analysis. "
723,14," The analyses utilized by Dr. McClave have been accepted by many courts as reasonable and reliable methods of proving 
class-wide damages. (Doc. 1085, p. 99) See In re Scrap Metal, 527 F.3d at 532-34 (approving multiple regression as a standard 
acceptable  [**64] scientific method); DRAM, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 39841, 2006 WL 1530166, at *10 (""[T]he before/after 
methodolog[y] . . . [has] already [been] upheld [] as [a] valid means for proving damages on a class-wide basis, and this court 
has found no reason to reject [it] at this stage of the proceedings.""); In re Bulk (Extruded) Graphite, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
16619, 2006 WL 891362, at *15 (approving multiple regression analysis to estimate damages); In re Flat Glass, 191 F.R.D. at 
486-87 (stating that properly constructed multiple regression models are one of the most mainstream ways to estimate damages 
in antitrust litigation); Urethane, 237 F.R.D. at 452 (accepting Dr. Tollison's assertion that ""before and after,"" multiple regression 
analysis, and price indices comparison are proper methods to prove class-wide damages). "
725,15," HN5[
] When ruling on a Rule 23 motion, the district court must make factual determinations on merits issues which are 
essential to the disposition of the Rule 23 motion. See Newton v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., 259 F.3d 154, 167 
(3d Cir. 2001) (citing Moores Fed.  [**71] Practice § 23.61[5]). Sections IV and V of this Memorandum constitute the court's 
compliance with these directives. See In re Hydrogen Peroxide Antitrust Litig., 552 F.3d 305, 317-18 (3d Cir. 2009)."
725,16," Direct Purchasers' Exhibits appear to be numbered twice. For ease and clarification, the court will utilize the exhibit numbers 
as they were submitted under seal."
725,17," As noted, Defendants cited the rising costs of expenses, both direct and indirect, and increases in the cost of commodities, as 
the catalyst for their three, lock-step price increases. (Pls.' Exs. 26, 28). Indeed, Defendants provide an extensive rationale for 
the price increases. (See Doc. 1028, at 12-18). The court makes no findings with respect to the merits of Defendants' 
justification, as it is not directly relevant to class certification. This evidence is relevant only to their defense on the merits of 
Direct Purchasers' allegations of a conspiracy. HN6[
] In the context of Rule 23, the court must focus its findings on issues pertinent to class certification. See Marcus v. BMW of N. Am., Inc., 687 F.3d 583, 590 (3d Cir. 2012). "
726,18," To be clear, the court does not adopt the Direct Purchasers' theory that each price increase was proceeded by the 
surreptitious exchange of information at the executive level. Nor is the court required to make such a finding at the class 
certification stage. See Marcus, 687 F.3d at 591 (only factual findings necessary to determine class certification need to be 
made at the Rule 23 stage). The court finds only that there is sufficient evidence in the record to support this proposition for 
purposes of its Rule 23 analysis. "
727,19," Although the court highlights this as an example, it also notes that the conference had numerous attendees from many 
different entities, in both the private and public sector."
727,20," HN7[
] Although Defendants do not challenge all Rule 23 requirements, the court must nonetheless determine that all 
requirements have been satisfied by a preponderance of the evidence. See Hydrogen, 552 F.3d at 310; Behrend, 655 F.3d at 
189. "
728,21," Many of Defendants' arguments contra typicality under Rule 23(a)(3) are also presented in the context of Rule 23(b)(3). By 
necessity, the court will revisit these arguments, in Part V.E.1. infra. "
729,22," This description of professional representation applies with equal force to the conduct of defense counsel during the course of 
these proceedings, and the court commends all counsel for their exemplary efforts during the course of these proceedings. "
731,23," Defendants  [**92] candidly acknowledge that Direct Purchasers' evidence of the alleged conspiracy is ""common to the class."" 
(See Doc. 1028, at 30). In the interest of brevity, the court incorporates by reference its discussion of commonality under Rule 
23(a)(2) set forth in Part IV.B. of this Memorandum. There is little doubt that the conspiracy element of the antitrust claims sub 
judice will be provable with evidence common to the class."
731,24," See e.g. Doc. MARSUS0638014 (Mars executive stating ""consumer[s] would not drive to another store [if their brand were 
unavailable, they] would switch brands""); Doc. HSY0770045 (2002 Hershey study concluding that if a consumer's preferred 
brand were not available, seventy-five percent of the time they will switch to another brand)."

0301257-58 CHL00824290, WCF00000035-38. In addition, Dr. Tollison points out that authoritative experts attribute trade 
association events to at least forty percent of past public antitrust cases. (Dr. Tollison, Doc. 999, at 16-17 n. 37 (citing George A. 
Hay & Daniel Kelly, An Empirical Survey of Price Fixing Conspiracies, 17 J. L. & Econ. 13 (1974)); Richard Posner, A Statistical 
Study of Antitrust Enforcement, 13 J.L. & Econ. 365 (1970)). "
732,27," Dr. McClave notes that the sole exception to this conclusion involves Nestlé's Wonka singles bar, which entered the market in 
2005 and experienced a sales plateau prior to the 2007 price increase. (Id. at 5 n.7)."
732,28," As the parties properly recognize, many similar arguments can be made for both impact and damages inquiries. See EPDM, 
256 F.R.D. at 88 (recognizing that impact and damages analyses, although distinct elements, are often conflated and the terms 
confused). In this light, the court will also address Dr. McClave's ""butfor"" analysis in the discussion on damages, see Part 
III.E.1.(a)(ii). (See also Doc. 1085, p. 90)."
732,29," As explained by the Seventh Circuit: An agreement to fix list prices is, as the Defendants' able counsel reluctantly conceded at the argument of the appeal, a per 
se violation of the Sherman Act even if most or for that matter all transactions occur at lower prices. Anyway sellers would 
not bother to fix list prices if they thought there would be no effect on transaction prices. Many sellers are blessed with 
customers who are ""sleepers,"" that is, customers who don't shop around for the best buy; and even for those who do 
bargain for a lower price, the list price is usually the starting point for the bargaining and the higher it is (within reason) the 
higher the ultimately bargained price  [**100] is likely to be. In re High Fructose Corn Syrup Antitrust Litig., 295 F.3d 651, 656 (7th Cir. 2002). "
733,30," Dr. McClave identifies approximately sixty-eight class members that were not impacted by the subject price increases. (Doc. 
991-1, at 4). Direct Purchasers state that Dr. McClave's models will be further refined, and, to the extent necessary, unaffected 
customers may be removed at the claims phase of the litigation. See In re OSB Antitrust Litig., Master File No. 06-826, 2007 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 56584, 2007 WL 2253418, at *9 (E.D. Pa. 2007) (stating ""[b]ecause the proposed class need only be 
ascertainable by some objective criteria, not actually ascertained, challenges to individual claims based on class membership 
may be resolved at the claims phase of the litigation."") (collecting cases). The court concurs in this approach, absent unforseen 
circumstances. The court also notes the possibility of ""impact"" in the absence of actual damages. See Linerboard, 203 F.R.D. at 
221 (stating ""if plaintiffs can establish list prices were higher, they can demonstrate impact"" regardless of the price ultimately 
negotiated for)."
733,31," Obviously, Defendants are not precluded from offering evidence at trial to support their argument that list prices and 
transactional prices are entirely unrelated. (See e.g., Doc. 1087, at 32-40) However, at this juncture, Direct Purchasers need 
only show, and have shown, that they will be able to prove through common evidence that the list price increases caused 
antitrust injury to the Direct Purchasers."
733,32," The court notes that Defendants' witnesses lend a modicum of support to Direct Purchasers' contention that list prices are the 
proper starting point for overall pricing negotiations. (See Doc. 1087, at 189-190 (David West of Hershey, stating that list prices 
were the most a customer could pay); id. at 271(Michael Tolkowsky of Mars, stating that customers receive an invoice which 
reflects both list prices and the discounts applied therefrom); see also id. at 163 (Dr. Johnson, stating that ""when you do the 
mechanical calculation, if what you're asking is what is the discount off of list price from actual price paid, well, as a matter of 
math that's what it is."") "
734,33," To analyze this data, Dr. McClave constructs two price indices — one using commodity cost data provided by Hershey, the 
other using publically available market  [**106] prices. (See Doc. 1085, at 131-132; Doc. 999-1, at 10). Dr. McClave relies upon 
Defendants' own financial statements and other documents and explains that ""the materials were weighted by the volumes 
purchased, a standard statistical technique."" (Doc. 999-1, at 10)."
734,34," Dr. McClave attributes the higher overcharge percentage to Defendants' habit of hedging certain commodity costs, especially 
cocoa, which Dr. McClave claims can ""delay and [] dampen the effects of changes in the material costs."" (Doc. 999-1, at 13; see 
Doc. 1085, at 133; Doc. 1049-1, at 17)."
734,35," The first stage model measures the impact of various factors on typical chocolate confectionary products during the class 
period. (See Doc. 1085, at 100; Doc. 999-1, at 12). Dr. McClave uses potentially relevant cost and demand factors as the 
explanatory variables at this stage.  [**107] (See Doc. 999-1, at 12). Defendants' main justification for the price increases was 
the rising cost of raw materials. Accordingly, Dr. McClave examines the price changes in materials used to make most chocolate 
confectionary products: cocoa, sugar, dairy, corn sweeteners, peanuts, and almonds. (See Doc. 1085, at 130; Doc. 999-1, at 
10). "
735,36," Dr. Johnson suggests that trade spend is wholly dependent on the individual relationship between each manufacturer and 
each Direct Purchaser. (Doc. 1031-1, at 44; Doc. 1086, at 341-342 (trade spend ""is a series of discounts and promotions that 
customers receive when they buy chocolate candy. They're individually negotiated with the manufacturer and they represent a 
wide variety of different programs and different moneys that flow back to the customers.""); Doc. 1087, at 6). Defendants are free 
to pursue this argument as part of their refutation of damages; however, variation in trade spend will not defeat class certification 
as it may have little impact on damage calculations (see Doc. 1049-1, at 31), and the court is convinced that the issue of trade 
spend may be addressed with evidence common to the class. See supra pp. 40-42. Moreover, to the extent  [**108] that 
variations in trade spend beget variations in damage calculations, the result is not fatal to class certification. See Behrend, 655 
F.3d at 204 (HN22[
] class certification will not be denied simply because of a difference in the ultimate amount of damages a 
plaintiff can collect); In re Urethane, 237 F.R.D. at 451 (class certified despite ""arguable product-specific and customer-specific 
pricing disparities."")"
735,37," As previously noted, see note 14 supra, the methodology employed by Dr. McClave is widely accepted for calculating 
overcharges in antitrust litigation. See also In re Blood Reagents Antitrust Litigation, 283 F.R.D. 222, 241 (E.D. Pa. (2012); 
 [**110] Linerboard, 305 F.3d at 153-55; McDonough, 638 F.Supp.2d at 490 n. 19."
735,38," The court also concurs with Dr. McClave's decision to exclude from his analysis certain items such as fundraiser, pre-printed, 
and bilingual products because they are not ""class products."" (Doc. 1049-1, at 30). "
736,39," Rule 23(b)(3) lists the following factors: (A) HN25[
] the interest of members of the class in individually controlling the prosecution or defense of separate actions; 
(B) the extent and nature of any litigation concerning the controversy already commenced by or against members of the 
class; (c) the desirability or undesirability of concentrating the litigation of the claims in the particular forum; (D) the 
difficulties likely to be encountered in the management of a class action. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3). "
755,1," The trial court issued a minute order granting class certification as to breach of contract and unjust enrichment claims in 
plaintiffs' third amended complaint but denied certification as to other claims, and directed plaintiffs' counsel to “prepare a ruling.” 
However, at plaintiffs' request, the court stayed entry of its final certification order to allow plaintiffs to seek leave to file a fourth 
amended complaint."
755,2, All subsequent statutory references are to the Insurance Code unless otherwise specified.
755,3," Section 1861.01, subdivision (c), provides that “insurance rates subject to this chapter must be approved by the commissioner 
prior to their use.”"
755,4," State Farm also filed a notice of appeal from the judgment for the purpose of obtaining review of two related prejudgment 
 [***4] orders that required it to bear the costs in question. "
756,5," State Farm requests that we take judicial notice of three items: (1) a “Stipulated Request for Dismissal With Prejudice” filed in 
an action by State Farm against the Insurance Commissioner challenging an opinion letter the Commissioner issued in Williams 
v. Interinsurance Exchange of the Automobile Club (Super. Ct. San Diego County, 2007, No. GIC836845) (see fn. 9, post); (2) a 
“Motion and Memorandum To Amend Class Action Complaint to Name One Additional Class Representative and To Amend the 
Class Definition,” filed in the trial court in a New Mexico action entitled Nakashima v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance 
 [***5] Company (No. CV-2004-00908); and (3) a “Memorandum Opinion and Order” granting summary judgment in favor of 
State Farm in the New Mexico action. We deny State Farm's request for judicial notice on the ground the materials in question 
are unnecessary to our resolution of the appeal. (County of San Diego v. State of California (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 580, 613, fn. 
29 [79 Cal. Rptr. 3d 489].)"
756,6, The complaint consists mainly of plaintiffs' legal argument.
756,7," Plaintiffs specifically allege that “State Farm impliedly represented that the SFPP Agreement was a legal and legitimate means 
to modify the [insurance] contract,” and that “State Farm omitted to inform plaintiffs and Class members that by law and by its 
own contract terms, the SFPP Agreement was an illegal contract and void or unenforceable and could not be used to modify or 
change the insurance contract.” "
757,8," Section 381, subdivision (f) requires that an insurance policy  [***10] specify either “(1) [a] statement of the premium, or [¶] (2) 
If the insurance is of a character where the exact premium is only determinable upon the termination of the contract, a statement 
of the basis and rates upon which the final premium is to be determined and paid.” Section 383.5 states: “ ‘Document,’ as used 
in this section, means a policy or a certificate evidencing insurance under a master policy. The policy or certificate shall conform 
to Section 381 and shall segregate the premiums charged for each risk insured against. The certificate, in lieu of specifying the 
risks insured against, may designate them by name or by description. ‘Document’ also includes the applicable policy form and a 
subsequently issued declarations page conforming to Section 381 or an endorsement.” "
759,9," Plaintiffs cite several California cases (Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. State Bd. of Equalization (1982) 32 Cal.3d 649 [186 Cal. 
Rptr. 578, 652 P.2d 426]; Allstate Ins. Co. v. State Board of Equalization (1959) 169 Cal.App.2d 165 [336 P.2d 961]; 
 [***17] Interinsurance Exchange v. State Bd. of Equalization (1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 606 [203 Cal. Rptr. 74]), two Attorney 
General opinions (9 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 257 (1947); 58 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 768 (1975)), and an Insurance Commissioner's opinion 
letter issued by California’s Department of Insurance (DOI) in 2006 supporting their position that installment payment fees 
charged by insurance companies are premium. Following Auto Club and Troyk, we do not rely on these authorities in deciding 
whether the installment fees at issue in this case are premium within the meaning of section 381, subdivision (f). We do not rely 
on Allstate and the cases approving or following it or the Attorney General opinions because those cases and opinions involve 
the interpretation of the term “gross premium” for purposes of insurance company taxation, which is a different context than that 
presented by this case. (See Troyk, supra, 171 Cal.App.4th at p. 1329.) We do not rely on or defer to the DOI's 2006 opinion 
because the meaning of the term “premium” under section 381, subdivision (f), is a question of law for our independent 
determination, and the DOI has not issued a formal regulation or had a long-standing opinion on the issue.  [***18] (Auto Club, 
supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1235–1237; Troyk, supra, 171 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1328–1329.)"
759,10," The  [***20] Troyk court acknowledged this critical distinction between the installment fees at issue in Troyk and the fees at 
issue here by distinguishing Nakashima as a case that “involved true installment payments of premium.” (Troyk, supra, 171 
Cal.App.4th at p. 1328, italics added.) "
762,11," A related provision in the “Cancellation” section states: “After the policy has been in force for more than 59 days, any notice of 
cancellation will be mailed or delivered to you at least: [¶] a. 10 days before the cancellation effective date if the cancellation is 
because you did not pay the premium.”"
762,12," This cancellation provision makes no sense under plaintiffs' view that the “When and Where Coverage Applies” section of the 
policy gives the insured until the end of a policy period to pay the full premium for that period. Under that view, State Farm could 
never cancel a policy “before the end of the current policy period” for failure to pay the premium when due because the premium 
would not be due until the end of the policy period."
762,13," Plaintiffs  [***31] allege in the complaint that “State Farm failed to tell plaintiffs and Class members that other State Farm 
insureds, such as those who paid under its ‘50/50 plan’ in two installments, pay in installments without a separate State Farm 
Payment Plan (‘SFPP’) Agreement or any other agreement outside of the insurance contract and without State Farm asserting 
that the installment pay violates the contract's payment terms.” "
764,14," Plaintiffs also allege that by charging the installment fee, State Farm violates common law and various other statutes, 
including Civil Code section 1750 et seq. (Consumers Legal Remedies Act), Civil Code sections 1572 (defining actual fraud), 
1573 (defining constructive fraud), and 1710 (defining deceit). These allegations of unlawfulness are also based on the 
contention that the installment fee is additional premium. "
767,15," The right of privacy is an “inalienable right” under article I, section 1 of the California Constitution. (Valley Bank of Nevada v. 
Superior Court (1975) 15 Cal.3d 652, 656 [125 Cal. Rptr. 553, 542 P.2d 977] (Valley Bank).)"
767,16," “[W]hether a legally recognized privacy interest exists is a question of law, and whether the circumstances give rise to a 
reasonable expectation of privacy and a serious invasion thereof are mixed questions of law and fact. [Citation.] ‘If the 
undisputed material facts show no reasonable expectation of privacy or an insubstantial impact on privacy interests, the question 
of invasion may be adjudicated as a matter of law.’ ” (Pioneer, supra, 40 Cal.4th at p. 370.) "
768,17," Judge Peterson referred to “plaintiff” in the singular although the subject discovery requests were propounded by two named 
plaintiffs."
768,18," In Connecticut Indemnity, a city council  [***54] issued subpoenas to liability insurers of parties potentially liable for toxic 
contamination of groundwater for the purpose of obtaining liability coverage information, and the insurers challenged the 
subpoenas on grounds they violated the privacy rights of their insureds under the California Constitution and the IIPPA. 
(Connecticut Indemnity, supra, 23 Cal.4th at pp. 812, 817.) The Supreme Court did not reach the constitutional privacy issue, 
and as to the insurers' argument that the IIPPA prevented them from complying with the subpoenas, the court observed that 
disclosure of information protected by the IIPPA without notice or consent to the insured is allowed under the act when the 
information is sought by governmental authority pursuant to law or disclosure is otherwise permitted or required by law. (23 
Cal.4th at p. 818, citing § 791.13, subds. (f) & (g).)"
768,19," “An  [***55] ‘opt-in’ letter requires the recipient to manifest consent to disclosure of indentifying information before his or her 
name or contact information will be released to the named plaintiff. An ‘opt-out’ letter requires no action by the recipient unless 
he or she wishes to prevent disclosure of his or her identifying information.” (Lee v. Dynamex, Inc. (2008) 166 Cal.App.4th 1325, 
1331, fn. 2 [83 Cal. Rptr. 3d 241].) "
769,20," In Colonial Life the plaintiff representative of a decedent's estate filed an action alleging unfair claims settlement practices 
against the decedent's insurer, and served the company that acted as the insurer's claims adjuster with a demand to produce 
documents pertaining to cases handled by the adjuster's employee who had handled the decedent's claim under  [***56] an 
accident policy. The insurer objected to production based on the IIPPA and other grounds. (Colonial Life & Accident Ins. Co. v. 
Superior Court, supra, 31 Cal.3d at p. 787.) The trial court ordered the adjuster to produce the names and addresses of all 
insureds whose claims for benefits had been handled by the employee in question and approved a letter to be sent by the 
plaintiff to those insureds, requesting their consent to the adjuster's release of their records. (Id. at p. 789.) Addressing the 
insurer's complaint that revealing information about other claimants potentially violated privacy interests protected by the IIPPA, 
the Supreme Court noted that under section 791.13 of the IIPPA, one of the exceptions to the prohibition against disclosure of 
personal or privileged information permits such disclosure with the written authorization of the insured, subject to certain 
requirements, including the requirement that the written authorization be obtained one year or less prior to the date a disclosure 
is sought. (§ 791.13, subd. (a).) The court observed that the notice procedure approved by the trial court “should satisfy these 
requirements if the authorization form, included in the letter sent to claimants, is returned  [***57] within a year.” (Colonial Life, 
supra, 31 Cal.3d at pp. 792–793, fn. 10.) "
770,21," In its appeal from the judgment, State Farm seeks review of the order adopting Judge Peterson's recommendations and the 
order denying its motion for reconsideration."
770,22," State Farm also argued that the notice costs were recoverable under Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5, subdivision 
(c)(4), in its opposition to plaintiffs' motion to tax costs. "
772,23," We recognize that in Crab Addison, Inc. v. Superior Court (2008) 169 Cal.App.4th 958 [87 Cal. Rptr. 3d 400] (Crab), the same 
court that decided Lee also decided that the trial court in Crab properly ordered a defendant to disclose contact information of its 
present and former employees who were putative class members without requiring notice or other protection of their privacy 
rights. We decline to follow Crab to the extent it conflicts with our conclusion that the discovery of identifying information for 
potential class members in a putative class action requires notice to the potential class members and an opportunity to object to 
disclosure. "
774,24," “Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5, subdivision (c)(2)'s requirement that the cost item be reasonably necessary to the 
conduct of the litigation is applicable to all items allowable as costs, whether awarded under [Code of Civil Procedure] section 
1033.5, subdivision (a), or [Code of Civil Procedure] section 1033.5, subdivision (c)(4), as is the requirement that ‘[a]llowable 
costs shall be reasonable in amount.’ ([Code Civ. Proc.,] § 1033.5, subd. (c)(3).) [Code of Civil Procedure s]ubdivision (c)(2), in 
other words, is a limitation on recoverable costs, not an authorization for an award of costs not otherwise permitted by statute.” 
(Seever v. Copley Press, Inc., supra, 141 Cal.App.4th at p. 1559, fn. 5.) "
778,1," In Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, 370 U.S. 294, 82 S. Ct. 1502, 8 L. Ed. 2d 510 (1962), the Supreme Court established 
several factors helpful in determining whether a submarket exists. See discussion infra Part II.C. "
780,2," Two types of relevant markets  [**11] must be identified: geographic market and product market. M.A.P. Oil, 691 F.2d at 1306. 
Geographic market is not at issue in this case. "
781,3," As support for its assertion that SSNIP is the controlling test, Bally cites Theme Promotions, which did allow that ""[d]etermining 
the relevant market can involve"" an SSNIP analysis, among other things. 546 F.3d at 1002. But the discussion of SSNIP in 
Theme Promotions was premised on United States v. Oracle Corp., 331 F. Supp. 2d 1098 (N.D. Cal. 2004), which in turn was 
elaborating on the Department of Justice's Horizontal Merger Guidelines (""the Guidelines""). The Ninth Circuit has stated that the 
Guidelines are not binding on the courts. See Olin Corp. v. FTC, 986 F.2d 1295, 1300 (9th Cir. 1993)."
781,4," We assume, although Bally does not explicitly say so, that Bally's argument is that wheel games are a submarket of all gaming 
machines. "
782,5," A leading antitrust treatise suggests that the two inquiries are the same. See IIB Phillip E. Areeda, John L. Solow & Herbert 
Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law ¶ 533c (3d ed. 2007) [hereinafter Areeda]. Although at least one district court in the Ninth Circuit has 
adopted this position, see United States v. Oracle Corp., 331 F. Supp. 2d 1098, 1118-19 (N.D. Cal. 2009), we are aware of no 
Ninth Circuit case that has done so.  [**19] See Newcal, 513 F.3d at 1045 (identifying the Brown Shoe factors as one way of 
showing that a submarket is economically distinct). In any event, we have already determined that Bally did not meet its burden 
to show that there was a relevant market in wheel games. "
785,1," Supply elasticity is a theory that neither party advanced. In fact, IGT argued that ""the critical question in determining an antitrust 
product market is the '""cross-elasticity"" of demand' between products. . . . Stated differently, the relevant antitrust market is the 
smallest group of products for which a hypothetical monopolist could profitably impose a 'small but significant and non-transitory 
increase in price' (SSNIP)."" The majority not only assigns weight to the allegedly high supply elasticity for wheel games but, in 
discussing demand elasticity, disparages the same test that IGT believed to  [**31] be ""the critical question"" in resolving this 
issue."
785,2," Rebel Oil Co. v. Atlantic Richfield Co., 51 F.3d 1421 (9th Cir. 1995), on which the majority relies, stands for the unremarkable 
proposition that a high degree of supply elasticity can bear on the relevant market inquiry and may even be determinative in 
 [**32] some cases. In that case the court found that full-serve gas stations were potential competitors of self-serve stations—
and thus belonged in the relevant market—because full-serve stations could ""easily convert their full-serve pumps, at virtually no 
cost, into self-serve, cash-only pumps, expanding output and thus constraining any attempt by [the alleged monopolist] to charge 
supracompetitive prices for self-serve gasoline."" Id. at 1436. Critically, however, nothing prevented the full-serve stations from 
making that change to their business in order to deter or rein in potentially monopolistic pricing by self-serve stations. Here, by 
contrast, potential suppliers were discouraged from entering the wheel game market by vigorous enforcement of the very 
patents that are being attacked as unlawful. "
815,1," Dow's motion (Doc. # 2402) remains pending as it relates to the claims asserted by direct action plaintiffs that have opted out of 
the class. The Court will address Dow's motion for summary judgment against the direct action plaintiffs by separate order. "
818,2," In Matsushita,  [**41] the Supreme Court concluded that the alleged conspirators would have had little motive to enter into the 
alleged conspiracy, which was economically implausible because it involved an inherently speculative and rarely successful 
predatory pricing scheme, intended to charged lower-than-competitive prices to drive out competitors; it involved not merely a 
single company, but 21 companies; each conspirator would have had a strong incentive to cheat during the conspiracy, and 
cheating would have been fatal to the conspiracy; and even after 20 years, the conspiracy had not yet succeeded, as the 
conspirators had not yet gained significant market share, even though such a conspiracy requires a long period of success to 
recoup losses sustained during the period of predatory pricing. See Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 589-93. The present case certainly 
does not involve such an unlikely conspiracy."
818,3," Moreover, even if the merits of Dow's argument were considered, the Court notes that Dow has not addressed any other 
factors that could contribute to pricing for the product; in the absence of such analysis, Dow has not shown that a conspiracy in 
which prices stabilized while one constituent cost rose (if  [**42] those facts are true, which is a question for the jury) is somehow 
nonsensical. "
820,4," Dow has submitted a second affidavit by Mr. Dineen in which he denies any link between that conversation and later pricing 
discussions within Lyondell. Nevertheless, Mr. Dineen's affidavits provide evidence at least that Mr. Dhanis of BASF was 
attempting to coordinate pricing with executives at Lyondell and Dow. "
821,5," Dow has moved to exclude opinions offered by plaintiffs' expert econometrician, and the Court will address that motion by 
separate order. Even if this particular evidence were excluded, the Court would nevertheless conclude that the evidence of a 
conspiracy is sufficient to withstand summary judgment. In opposing summary judgment, plaintiffs do not appear to rely on their 
liability expert's opinion that defendant's conduct is more consistent with collusion that with competition. "
823,6," The district court's opinion in Western Paving was reversed by a panel of the Tenth Circuit, see 833 F.2d 867 (10th Cir. 1987), 
but the panel's opinion was subsequently vacated, and the district court judgment was affirmed and reinstated without 
explanation by an equally divided Tenth Circuit, see 841 F.2d 1025 (10th Cir. 1988). Such an affirmance by the Tenth Circuit is 
not entitled to any precedential value. See Rutledge v. United States, 517 U.S. 292, 304, 116 S. Ct. 1241, 134 L. Ed. 2d 419 
(1996). "
825,7," In its initial brief, Dow also assumed that plaintiffs would be limited to relying only on the three specific pricing announcements 
identified by plaintiffs in their amended complaint. In its prior order, however, the Court did not limit plaintiffs' theory only to those 
three announcements. See Urethane, 235 F.R.D. at 518. In their summary judgment response, plaintiffs relied on all of the 
announcements issued during the alleged conspiracy period, and Dow did not object to that approach in its reply brief. 
Accordingly, the Court will not limit plaintiffs only to reliance on the three particular announcements. "
834,1," A helpful characterization of this business is that freight forwarders are ""travel agents"" for cargo. (See Omni Mem. (Dkt. 28) at 
2.)"
834,2," Hatching eggs, according to the Amended Complaint, are ""poultry hatching eggs."" (Am. Compl. ¶ 15.)"
834,3," Plaintiff does not specify whether it began shipping exclusively hatching eggs, or simply added hatching eggs to the variety of 
different products it already shipped."
834,4, This shipping information includes the name of the purchaser and the type and quantity of eggs being purchased. (Id.) 
835,5," After the court granted Omni Defendants leave to file a motion to dismiss Plaintiff's Amended Complaint, DelEx Defendants 
requested leave to move to dismiss Plaintiff's Amended Complaint against them. (Dkt. 19.) Because DelEx Defendants raised 
substantially different issues than those raised in Omni Defendants' motion, the court denied DelEx Defendants' request. (Jan. 
12, 2012, Order.) After a pre-motion conference with the court, DelEx Defendants answered Plaintiff's complaint and cross-
claimed against Omni Defendants for indemnification and contribution. (Dkt. 22). "
836,6," Omni Defendants requested oral argument on their motion. (Dkt. 33.) The court denied Omni Defendants' request without 
prejudice and stated  [**9] that it would advise the parties if it were to determine that oral argument would be helpful. (March 22, 
2012, Order (Dkt. 34).) The court has determined that this motion can be resolved without oral argument."
836,7," Plaintiff seems to suggest a lower standard that would allow the court to ""look beyond the well-pled allegations when assessing 
[the] complaint."" (Pl. Mem. at 6.) HN2[
] The appropriate standard, however, is the Twombly standard, which arose from an antitrust case and has since been held to apply to cases more broadly. In re Elevator Antitrust Litig., 502 F.3d 47, 50 (2d Cir. 
2007); see also Habitat, Ltd. v. The Art of Muse, Inc., No. 07-CV-2883 (DRH), 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25096, 2009 WL 803380, 
at *3 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 25, 2009). Twombly requires more than mere allegations of unlawful behavior—it requires ""enough facts to 
'nudge [Plaintiffs'] claims across the line from conceivable to plausible."" Elevator Antitrust, 502 F.3d at 50. Plaintiff also relies on 
the proposition  [**11] that HN3[
] judges should be cautious before dismissing an antitrust complaint in advance of discovery. 
(Pl. Mem. at 7.) As the Twombly court explained, however, this must be balanced by the principle that ""a district court must 
retain the power to insist upon some specificity in pleading before allowing a potentially massive factual controversy to proceed,"" 
and must decline to send parties into discovery when there is no reasonable likelihood that the plaintiffs can construct a claim 
from the facts alleged in the complaint. Twombly, 550 U.S. at 558 (quoting Associated Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc. v. 
Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 103 S. Ct. 897, 74 L. Ed. 2d 723 (1983)). "
837,8," Specifically, Plaintiff argues that it was injured by: (1) the agreement between Morris and Omni, which makes it more difficult for 
Plaintiff to obtain customers; and (2) Defendants' actions—notably, the email sent to Plaintiff's contacts—that have made it more 
difficult for Plaintiff to book transportation because cargo owners refuse to work with Plaintiff. (Pl. Mem. at 14.) According to 
Plaintiff, ""[a]s a new market entrant trying to break into the relevant product market it is difficult to imagine a plaintiff that has 
been more harmed than [it has]."" (Id.) Although Plaintiff does not clarify, this statement must refer to the market of  [**13] freight 
forwarding of hatching eggs, the only market Plaintiff has tried to enter. "
838,9," Horizontal restraints are those imposed by agreements between competitors, whereas vertical restraints are those imposed by 
agreement between entities at different levels of the supply chain. E&L Consulting. Ltd. v. Doman Industries Ltd., 472 F.3d 23, 
29 n.4 (2d Cir. 2006)."
838,10," Plaintiff mischaracterizes the agreement between Omni and Morris by calling it a tying agreement. HN9[
] A tying agreement 
is ""an agreement by a party to sell one product but only on the condition that the buyer also purchase a different (or tied) 
product."" E & L Consulting, 472 F.3d at 31. To show a tying agreement, a plaintiff must demonstrate: (1) a tying and a tied 
product; (2) evidence of actual coercion by the seller that forced the buyer to accept the tied product; (3) sufficient economic 
power in the tying product market to coerce purchaser acceptance of the tied product; (4) anticompetitive effects in the tied 
market; and (5) the involvement of a not insubstantial amount of interstate commerce in the tied market. Id. ""The essential 
characteristic of an invalid tying arrangement lies in the seller's exploitation of its control over the tying product to force the buyer 
into the purchase of a tied product  [**19] that the buyer either did not want at all, or might have preferred to purchase elsewhere 
on different terms."" De Jesus v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., Inc., 87 F.3d 65, 70 (2d Cir. 1996). Purchasers of hatching eggs from 
Morris are not forced to buy an additional product, but are required to use the services of a particular freight forwarder. However, 
even putting aside Plaintiff's mischaracterization of the agreement, the vertical agreement between Omni and Morris fails to fall 
under the per se rule."
838,11," HN10[
] Vertical restraints that do not involve price restraints have always fallen outside the per se rule. Continental T.V.,"
838,433," U.S. at 58 (""When anticompetitive effects are shown to result from particular vertical restrictions they can be adequately 
policed under the rule of reason . . . .""). Vertical restraints involving price fixing used to be considered per se violations. See, "
839,," e.g., id. at 51 n.18. But this is no longer the case. See Leegin, 551 U.S. at 907 (overruling prior precedent to hold that ""[v]ertical 
price restraints are to be judged according to the rule of reason"")."
839,12," Plaintiff also argues that the per se rule applies because the violation it pleads has ""elements"" from per se violations, including 
horizontal price fixing, horizontal market divisions, concerted refusals to deal, and unlawful tying agreements. (Pl. Mem. at 8.) 
Plaintiff provides no precedent for recognition of such an anomalous violation. Moreover, there is no evidence that the alleged 
violation would allow the court to predict with confidence that the restraint would be invalidated under the rule of reason, as is 
required for application of the per se rule. See Leegin 551 U.S. at 886-87. Plaintiff's argument indicates a misunderstanding of 
the per se rule. "
840,13," Plaintiff alleges that as a result of Defendants' antitrust violations, its business has been harmed to the tune of $1 million 
(before trebling damages). (See Am. Compl.) HN13[
] Harm to Plaintiff as an individual competitor, however, does not suffice 
to establish antitrust injury under the Sherman Act. George Haug Co., 148 F.3d at 139. "
841,14," According  [**29] to Plaintiff, it need only show ""probability of substantial competitive injury"" and need not prove actual injury. 
(Pl. Mem. at 11.) Plaintiff's contention is incorrect. George Haug Co., 148 F.3d at 139 (explaining that HN17[
] ""[a] private plaintiff seeking to state a claim for violation of sections 1 or 2 of the Sherman Act must allege that it has suffered 'antitrust 
injury'"" which obligates a plaintiff to show that the challenged action has had ""an actual adverse effect on competition as a whole 
in the relevant marketplace""). "
842,15," There is no diversity between the Plaintiff and Defendants (see Am. Compl. ¶¶ 1-4), and thus the court does not have diversity 
jurisdiction over these claims under 28 U.S.C. § 1332. "
843,1," Until three days before the hearing on this matter, Plaintiffs were unrepresented. At that time, the Court granted Plaintiffs' 
request to have attorney Aalok Sikand appear on their behalf. "
844,2," All the relevant allegations in this action relate to Plaintiff Gwendolyn Smith. For this reason, and for the sake of simplicity, the 
Court refers to both Plaintiffs in the singular as ""Plaintiff."""
844,3," Before the loan would be disbursed, Plaintiff had to obtain a written treatment plan, which she expected to receive from 
Defendant after he made a ""visual diagnosis."" (See FAC at 3.)"
844,4," The Court cites to page numbers rather than paragraph numbers because, as was the case with the SAC, many of the 
paragraph numbers in the TAC are obscured by the lines and numbers created by use of a pleading format with insufficient left 
margin adjustment."
844,5," Plaintiff's claims list the ""SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION"" after the ""FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION."" (TAC at 10-11.) For the sake 
of simplicity, the Court follows suit."
844,6," Defendant again challenges the Court's subject-matter jurisdiction, a matter properly addressed by the standard for dismissal 
pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The Court has ruled previously on this issue, and will not 
revisit its ruling at this time. (See Docket No. 34.) To the extent the challenge is premised on the younger Smith's domicile, he 
was a minor at the time the present action was filed, and it has long been the case that minor children are generally presumed to 
have the same domicile as their parents. See Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians v. Holyfield, 490 U.S. 30, 48, 109 S. Ct. 
1597, 104 L. Ed. 2d 29 (1989) (citing Yarborough v. Yarborough, 290 U.S. 202, 211, 54 S. Ct. 181, 78 L. Ed. 269 (1933)). "
846,7," In addition to the reasoning set forth herein, this claim has been withdrawn by Plaintiff. Specifically, at the hearing, Plaintiffs' 
counsel argued that the unlawfulness claim was not based on the CLRA, effectively abandoning the CLRA as a basis for her 
claim. "
849,1," In light of the Court's dismissal of Defendant's counterclaim, it is unnecessary to consider whether the counterclaim and 
Defendant's class allegations should be stricken."
849,2," Defendant refers to Plaintiffs and their unnamed coconspirators, collectively, as ""conspirators"" in the counterclaim. "
853,3," Defendant's reliance on Doe v. Arizona Hosp. & Healthcare Ass'n, No. CV 07-1292-PHX-SRB, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 42871, 
2009 WL 143378, at *3 (D. Ariz. Mar. 19, 2009) is misplaced. In Arizona, the court held that the plaintiffs stated a valid per se 
claim because the complaint at issue alleged that the defendants fixed purchasing prices, in part, by adopting ""a uniform pay 
rate scale for per diem and travel nurses and agreeing to expel . . . any hospital using participating agencies for less than 50 
percent of its total per diem needs."" Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). Defendant's counterclaim fails to allege such specific 
facts to support the plausible inference that PBGs fixed prices. "
854,4," The Court is unaware of, and Defendant has not cited a single case in which a PBG has been held to be illegal per se. That 
courts have not had considerable experience with the type of restraint at issue in this case provides yet another reason as to 
why Defendant [*19]  has failed to state a per se claim. See, e.g., Leegin, 551 U.S. at 885. "
855,5," The only vaccine manufacturer that exited the market which is identified by name in the counterclaim is Wyeth. (See CC ¶ 84.) 
Defendant alleges that Wyeth exited the market because of the ""lack of profitability for vaccines."" (Id.) To infer that Wyeth's 
decision to exit the vaccine market was a result of PBGs would be pure speculation. "
858,6, Defendant asserts the following affirmative defenses:
858,1, . The Complaint fails to state any cause of action upon which relief may be granted.
858,2, . Sanofi's conduct was procompetitive or otherwise justified by legitimate business reasons.
858,3, . Plaintiffs lack antitrust standing to seek redress for the injuries alleged in the Complaint.
858,4, . Plaintiffs have not suffered an injury-in-fact or antitrust injury as a result of Sanofi's [*34]  challenged conduct.
858,5, . The Complaint is barred by the doctrine of unclean hands or in pan delecto [sic].
858,6," . The Complaint is barred by the doctrines of estoppel, lathes, and waiver."
858,7," . Any damages or injury alleged in the Complaint were caused or contributed to, in part, by reason of the culpable conduct 
of plaintiffs and by reason thereof, the recovery of plaintiffs, if any, shall be reduced and diminished in proportion to the 
plaintiffs' respective culpability."
858,8," . Any damages or injury alleged in the Complaint were caused or contributed to, in part, by reason of the culpable conduct 
of plaintiffs and by reason thereof, the recovery of plaintiffs, if any, shall be reduced and diminished in proportion to the 
plaintiffs' respective culpability."
858,9," . Plaintiffs' claims are not actionable for at least all of the reasons set forth in Sanofi's briefing on its motion to dismiss, 
including documents 50-1 and 88. "

878,2," Initially, Plaintiffs argued that a CEA claim accrues only after ""a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have sufficient information 
about [the facts supporting the claim] to adequately plead  [**40] [them] in a complaint."" See City of Pontiac Gen Emps. Ret. 
Sys. v. MBIA, Inc., 637 F.3d 169, 174-176 (2d Cir. 2011) (articulating standard for accrual of securities fraud claims after Merck 
& Co. v. Reynolds, 559 U.S. 633, 130 S. Ct. 1784, 176 L. Ed. 2d 582 (2010)). But Plaintiffs now concede Benfield is the proper

883,2," By judgment of Civil District Court, Parish of New Orleans on September 14, 2011, in the Succession of Kepper McKee 
Maitland, Docket No. 11-9885, Christa was judicially recognized as Kepper's surviving spouse and placed in legal possession of 
her one-half interest in their community property which allegedly included any and all interests in State Farm Insurance Agency 
owned by her deceased husband. (Rec. Doc. 1-1, at 18). "
886,3," Plaintiffs specifically cite La. Rev. Stat. 51:122l 51:121, 51:123, and 51:1405. (Rec. Doc. 48-2). "
900,1," Electrograph brings claims under the California Cartwright Act; Sears and AT&T bring claims under the Illinois Antitrust Act; 
Target and Best Buy bring claims under the Minnesota antitrust statute; Kmart brings claims under the Michigan Antitrust Reform 
Act (MARA); and Electrograph and AT&T bring claims under the New York Donnelly Act. At the hearing, plaintiffs' counsel stated 
that Good Guys is not pursuing any indirect purchaser claims. "
901,2," The IPP class settlement settles the claims of members of 25 state classes (Arizona, Arkansas, California, the District of 
Columbia, Florida, Hawaii, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New 
Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Vermont, West Virginia, and 
Wisconsin), as well as the parens  [*46] patriae claims brought by the states of Arkansas, California, Florida, Michigan, Missouri, 
and New York."
901,3," For example, Dell has sued defendants alleging direct purchaser claims over its purchases of LCD panels that Dell 
incorporated into notebook computers; Best Buy alleges indirect purchaser claims against defendants regarding its purchases of 
notebook computers from Dell; and the IPP and parens patriae cases alleged indirect purchaser claims on behalf of consumers 
who purchased Dell notebook computers from retailers such as Best Buy."
901,4," Plaintiffs argue that if defendants are permitted to assert a pass-on defense, Clayworth ""necessitates the consideration of 
consequential damages."" Docket No. 6628 at 13:14. See Clayworth, 49 Cal.4th at 785-86 (""A purchaser might lose profits or 
sales, and perhaps market share as well, vis-à-vis another purchaser/distributor not subject to the same overcharge. . . . [O]ne 
cannot rationally admit evidence of a pass-on, under a theory  [*49] of mitigation, while also excluding evidence that the pass-on 
in fact failed to mitigate fully the loss occasioned by the original overcharge.""). In their reply, defendants assert that plaintiffs 
have never sought consequential damages. "
920,1," Each of the complaints contains a specific section entitled ""co-conspirators"" or ""agents and co-conspirators,"" but none of the 
entities at issue in this motion were identified as a ""co-conspirator"" in the complaints. See Docket No. 3508 ¶¶ 68-72 (AT&T 
Third Amended Compl.); Docket No. 3681 ¶¶ 72-75 (Electrograph First Amended Compl.); Docket No. 3511 ¶¶ 84-86 (Target 
Second Amended Compl.); Docket No. 2878 ¶¶ 51-72 (Best Buy First Amended Compl.). "
922,2," Plaintiffs  [*49] also contend that Special Master Quinn has already denied a variation of defendants' motion. In June 2012, 
defendants moved to strike portions of plaintiffs' experts' rebuttal reports, including the portions of those reports that addressed 
new putative co-conspirators not addressed in the experts' opening reports. The special master denied defendants' motion, 
finding that the experts did not exceed the scope of proper rebuttal under Rule 26. Docket No. 5960 at 4:5-9. The special master 
did not address the question presented by the current motion, namely whether plaintiffs have identified a number of co-
conspirators for the first time in their expert reports, and if so, whether doing so prejudices defendants."
922,3," Defendants assert that plaintiffs' discovery responses only disclose evidence of meetings between competitors, and that 
""attending a meeting is not the same as agreeing to conspire."" Docket No. 6708 at 6:17-18. The Court finds that the various 
charts and responses, which were provided in response to interrogatories asking for evidence of conspiratorial meetings and 
participants, put defendants on notice that plaintiffs claimed that the entities listed were involved in the conspiracy. See, e.g., 
Docket No. 7132-4 (AT&T and Motorola ""Attachment A"" listing ""Conspiracy Meetings"" and ""Defendant(s)/Co-conspirator(s)."""
922,4," Defendants seek summary judgment on the Target plaintiffs' purchases from ""Hitachi,"" without specifying which Hitachi entities 
are at issue. In discovery, the Target plaintiffs disclosed Hitachi Ltd., Hitachi Displays, Ltd., and Hitachi Electronic Devices 
(USA), Inc. as purported co-conspirators. "
923,5," The supplemental declaration of David Martinez states that Best Buy identified Advanced Displays, Inc. in its December 2, 
2011 discovery responses, but the Court was not able to locate where Best Buy made this disclosure."
923,6," Similarly, plaintiffs assert that disclosing ""Mitsui"" as a purported co-conspirator is sufficient to identify Mitsui and Co. (Taiwan) 
Ltd. and Mitsui and Co. (USA), Inc. "
924,7," The Court also finds that the ""various unnamed persons"" allegations — ""Various persons and/or firms not named as 
Defendants in this Complaint are believed to have participated as co-conspirators in the violations alleged herein and to have 
performed acts and made statements in furtherance thereof, all of the names and acts are within the exclusive knowledge of the 
Defendants"" Docket No. 2878 ¶ 53 (Best Buy First Amended Compl.) — are insufficient, absent a subsequent disclosure by 
plaintiffs of the identities of the alleged co-conspirators."
924,8," Plaintiffs assert state law indirect purchaser claims under the laws of California, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, and New York. "
925,9," See Mich. Comp. Laws § 445.784(2) (""It is the intent of the legislature that in construing all sections of this act, the courts shall

Devices Corp., EpsonElectronics America, Inc."
941,3, The parties do not dispute that the first two Illinois Brick exceptions are inapplicable.
941,4," The vendors are: Acer Computers, eMachines, Envision Peripherals, Gateway, JVC, Panasonic, Proview, Sylvania, and Vizio. 
Costco notes in its Opposition that it does not seek to recover for its purchases from Princeton GS, which Defendants had also 
mentioned in its motion. Opposition at 3, n. 2. "
943,5," Defendants dispute IPS Alpha's alleged participation in the price-fixing conspiracy. However, subsequent to the briefing of this 
motion, the Court found that, for purposes of summary judgment, there is admissible evidence from which a jury could conclude 
that IPS Alpha participated in the price-fixing conspiracy. See Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Defendants' Joint 
Motion for Partial Summary Judgment as to NonParty Co-Conspirators, Dkt. No. 7109 (November 6, 2012)(""During the alleged 
conspiracy, IPS Alpha was created by and remained controlled and operated by Panasonic, Toshiba, and Hitachi, and IPS 
Alpha's president (who also served as Hitachi's president) attended a number of price-fixing meetings. Plaintiffs have also 
submitted evidence showing that representatives from Panasonic, which was formerly Matsushita Electric, exchanged pricing 
and other proprietary LCD panel information with defendants. This evidence is sufficient to raise a triable issue of fact to defeat 
summary judgment.""). "
944,6," That interest dropped to 36.8% after the conspiracy, until 2007, when JVC merged with Kenwood to form JVC Kenwood 
Holdings (which now owns 100% of JVC). See Merriman Decl., Exh. 13-15. As  [*61] of March 31, 2012, Panasonic owned 
19.21% of JVC Kenwood. Id., Exh. 1 at 22."
944,7," Gateway Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of Acer Inc., and Gateway Inc. acquired eMachines in 2004. Opposition at 16. "
945,8," The Court finds it unnecessary to reach defendants' argument concerning Costco's claims based on purchases from vendors 
who ""appear to be members of the Direct Purchaser Plaintiff class."" "
957,1," The Court will only address category three because there are no allegations that the Defendant asked the Plaintiff to perform 
any illegal act. The action at issue is purely the action taken by the Plaintiff and whether or not he can be terminated. Thus, the 
first category does not need to be analyzed because no positive action was takers by the Defendant."
957,2," In feet, it is worth noting that the freedom to contract, while the general rule is often subject to restriction. The public policy 
exception to the employment at-will doctrine is one such example of a restriction on the general rule. Indeed, the Plaintiff's very 
suit is an example of a restriction on the freedom to contract. Therefore, it is likely that the nebulous policy of ""freedom to 
contract"" is insufficient to provide the specific mandate required to sustain an action based on a violation of public policy."
957,3," Plaintiff in Delaney was terminated when she told her employer that she needed four weeks off of work in order to recuperate 
from donating her kidney to her brother. Id. at * 1-2. Her employer stated that it could not hold her position open for four weeks"
957,4," Because Delaney establishes that mandates of policy are determined by among other things, ""the constant practice of 
government officials,"" Delaney, 2012 Mo. App. LEXIS 694 at *3, Plaintiff attempts to use the Missouri Attorney General's practice 
of pursuing consumer protection actions to display that Missouri has a policy of protecting Missouri consumers. However, this 
practice of the Missouri Attorney General is barely related to this claim at all. Although the Plaintiff is a consumer and a citizen of 
Missouri, how he interacts with his employer has nothing to do with the Missouri Attorney General's prosecution of consumer 
fraud. The Court sees no connection, and therefore will place little emphasis on this point in its Order. "
958,5," A review of Loomis beyond the one line offered by Plaintiff reveals quite a lot of context that does not support the way Plaintiff 
attempted to use that one line."
958,6," The court explains that this statute was intended to end the company store. Roberts, 444 S.E.2d at 729. Coal companies used 
to require miners to make purchases at a store owned by the coal company and only paid the workers ""script,"" which was only 
good at the company store. Id. "
959,7," Other portions of that provision state that it is unlawful to monopolize or conspire to monopolize, and [*15]  that it is unlawful for 
anyone engaged in commerce or trade to fix a price or discount with a lessee who agrees to no use or deal in the commodities 
or be a competitor of the seller. Mo. Rev. Stat § 416.031.2; § 416.031.3. "
967,1," A more detailed description of the facts is set forth in both this court's previous opinion, Micron I, 255 F.R.D. at 137-48, and the 
Federal Circuit's opinion, Micron II, 645 F.3d at 1315-19. The court indicated during oral argument on January 26, 2012 that it 
would not disturb its factual findings because the Federal Circuit's opinion only required this court to explain its analysis more 
clearly. (D.I. 1150 at 34:19-22, 44:14-18) Accordingly, the court's analysis on remand is confined to the scope of the findings of 
fact already of record. "
969,2," At the time he was hired, Karp believed that any attempt to negotiate a license with Micron would result in litigation. (D.I. 1058 
at 229:20-230:13; see also id. at 228:7-15)"
969,3," Johnson testified that he commonly advised clients to adopt a document retention policy but that ""battle ready"" was not a 
phrase he used. (D.I. 1062 at 1493:19-1494:5, 1498:24-1499:19)"
969,4," Rambus had charged RDRAM licensees a royalty rate of one to two percent. (D.I. 1071 at 216:15-18, 216:24-217:2) Johnson 
testified that Karp's suggested royalty rate was a ""ridiculous number"" ""north of four percent"" and recalled thinking that, if Rambus 
insisted on that rate, it would not ""have a licensing program [but instead would have] a lawsuit on [its] hands."" (D.I. 1062 at 
1491:23-1493:18) Johnson was not aware of Tate's instruction to Karp to set a royalty rate that would show competitors that ""it 
would cost to infringe."" (Id. at 1555:18-1556:8, 1558:2-14, 1562:7-1563:5, 1568:14-1569:1) Karp believed that companies would 
""fiercely resist"" five percent running royalty rates on licenses for non-compatible products (D.I. 1058 at 244:3-11), and Tate 
acknowledged that a five percent rate would possibly lead a potential licensee to reject the licensing offer. (D.I. 1060 at 717:14-
718:3) A memorandum that Karp wrote in late 1998 or early 1999 discussed using royalty rates in the ""5-10% range, in cases 
where [Rambus]  [**13] is not interested in settling."" (MTX 763 at 0004) "
970,5," Karp testified that he was not aware of a document retention policy being discussed at Rambus prior to March 1998. (MTX 295 
at 242:13-243:12)"
970,6," In April 1998, at Karp's request, Kroll Ontrack, Inc. performed an on-site information security audit of Rambus. (D.I. 1062 at 
1430:7-1431:16, 1436:5-21; RAMTX 99) Following the audit, Kroll recommended that Rambus ""[w]ork[ ] with counsel . . . [to] 
create a written plan covering how long various classes of files should be held."" (RAMTX 99 at 0026; D.I. 1062 at 1441:20-
1446:1)"
970,7," Johnson left Cooley Godward to join the law firm of Fenwick & West sometime after February 1998. (D.I. 1058 at 236:6-14) 
Karp continued to work with Johnson on Rambus' litigation preparations (MTX 345 at 0005-0007) but stopped dealing with Girvin 
and Leal soon thereafter. (D.I. 1058 at 236:10-237:15)"
970,8," Steinberg later performed this work as in-house counsel for Rambus, beginning in April 1999. (D.I. 1060 at 833:16-837:12) "
971,9," Each back-up tape could store approximately 100,000 documents, including internal emails. (D.I. 1060 at 579:22-580:8; see 
also D.I. 1061 at 1156:7-16, 1170:17-1171:2) "
972,10," ""Shred"" days, or ""office clean out"" days, were common among firms in the area and typically involved employees being 
excused from their regular duties for a period of time so that they could remove materials from their offices or cubicles that were 
scheduled to be disposed of according to an organization's document retention policy. (D.I. 1059 at 524:3-526:14) "
973,11," Johnson had earlier advised Rambus that it should, in keeping with ""very common practice,"" remove from its patent 
prosecution files — and have outside counsel remove from its Rambus patent prosecution files as well — all materials not part of 
the official record, which was advice Cooley Godward gave to all its clients. (D.I. 1062 at 1500:3-1501:9) By April 1999, Rambus 
had already purged its patent files pursuant to the document retention policy. (D.I. 1061 at 1350:4-15; D.I. 1071 at 94:12-95:2, 
99:4-14, 107:12-24, 108:1-8, 112:13-20, 116:6-8, 117:1-7) Although Vincent had from time to time prior to April 1999 discarded 
drafts, notes or similar materials related to Rambus' patents, this was the first time that he had systematically reviewed the 
Rambus patent prosecution files for cleaning in connection with the Rambus document retention policy. (D.I. 1062 at 1406:14-
1407:4) Vincent preserved and later produced in discovery at least some correspondence and meeting notes from  [**26] his 
patent files. (E.g., MTX 42; MTX 47; MTX 54; MTX 420; MTX 934; RAMTX 142; RAMTX 143; RAMTX 266)"
973,12," Rambus' in-house patent counsel from September 1995 to May 1999, Anthony Diepenbrock, testified that he had purged 
similar materials from the Rambus patent files. (D.I. 1071 at 102:24-103:4, 103:16-104:7, 105:1-5, 108:1-8, 118:9-12) These 
kinds of materials are typically sought in discovery in patent cases. (D.I. 1061 at 1071:14-1072:13) "
974,13," Earlier in June 1999, Karp detailed his progress fulfilling his key results for 1999. (MTX 807 at 0014; D.I. 1058 at 311:21-
313:2) Among the key results he was trying to achieve in 1999, Karp identifies ""[c]ommencing licensing negotiation with one 
company and start clock for calculation of damages during Q4/99;"" ""[c]ommencing license negotiation with two additional 
companies during Q1/00;"" ""[c]hoos[ing] one company to litigate with during Q1/00;"" and ""[c]ommencing litigation during Q2/00, 
upon exec/board approval."" (MTX 807 at 0014; see also D.I. 1058 at 313:3-12) Karp testified at trial that, by June 1999, litigation 
was a written goal and that suing was ""maybe a likelihood."" (D.I. 1059 at 348:17-349:22, 350:12-21) "
975,14," HN1[
] ""Spoliation refers to the destruction or material alteration of evidence or to the failure to preserve property for 
another's use as evidence in pending or reasonably foreseeable litigation."" Micron II, 645 F.3d at 1320 (quoting Silvestri v. Gen. 
Motors Corp., 271 F.3d 583, 590 (4th Cir. 2001)) (internal quotation marks omitted). "
976,15," In any case, Micron was identified as a potential litigation target as early as May 1998. (MTX 345 at 0005-0007; D.I. 1058 at 
255:13-256:13, 257:9-19) "
978,16," One further piece of evidence suggesting that Rambus' spoliation was done in bad faith is that the only reason Micron has as 
much evidence as it does is because the court pierced Rambus' attorney-client privilege based on the crime-fraud exception. 
(D.I. 711) The Federal Circuit affirmed the court's decision to pierce. Micron II, 645 F.3d at 1331. "
979,17," Rambus filed a motion for leave to file a reply brief to address newly raised issues in Micron's response remand brief. (D.I. 
1132) Rambus' motion was based on Micron's arguments regarding prejudice to its defenses of prosecution  [**45] laches and 
derivation (35 U.S.C. § 102(f)); these defenses were allegedly raised for the first time in Micron's responsive remand brief. 
Because the court finds that Rambus prejudiced several of Micron's other defenses, the court denies the motion as moot."
979,18," The Federal Circuit in Hynix adopted a prior holding regarding the scope and nature of the duty of disclosure to JEDEC. It held 
that ""participation in JEDEC imposed a duty to disclose pending applications and issued patents with claims that a competitor or 
other JEDEC member reasonably would construe to cover the standardized technology."" Hynix, 645 F.3d at 1348-49 (internal 
quotation marks omitted) (citing Rambus Inc. v. Infineon Techs. AG, 318 F.3d 1081, 1100-04 (Fed. Cir. 2003)). "
980,19," For example, HN4[
] monopolization and attempted monopolization require ""(1) the possession of monopoly  [**49] power in 
the relevant market and (2) the willful acquisition or maintenance of that power as distinguished from growth or development as 
a consequence of a superior product, business acumen, or historic accident."" Broadcom Corp. v. Qualcomm Inc., 501 F.3d 297, 
307 (3d Cir. 2007) (noting that the second element may be based on misrepresentations or intentionally false promises in the 
standard-setting process). HN5[
] Delaware's deceptive trade practices act prohibits conduct that ""creates a likelihood of confusion or of misunderstanding."" 6 Del. C. § 2532(a)(12); see also Accenture Global Servs. GmbH v. Guidewire Software Inc., 
581 F. Supp. 2d 654, 665 (D. Del. 2008). HN6[
] California's unfair competition law regulates ""conduct that threatens an 
incipient violation of an antitrust law, or violates the policy or spirit of one of those laws . . ., or otherwise significantly threatens 
or harms competition."" Cel-Tech Commc'ns, Inc. v. Los Angeles Cellular Tel. Co., 20 Cal. 4th 163, 83 Cal. Rptr. 2d 548, 973 
P.2d 527, 539-44 (Cal. 1999). And HN7[
] a patent misuse claim may relate ""generally to the use of patent rights to obtain or to 
coerce an unfair commercial advantage."" C.R. Bard, Inc. v. M3 Sys., Inc., 157 F.3d 1340, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 1998); see  [**50] also 
Princo Corp. v. Int'l Trade Comm'n, 616 F.3d 1318, 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (""[T]he key inquiry under the patent misuse doctrine is 
whether . . . the patentee has impermissibly broadened the physical or temporal scope of the patent grant and has done so in a 
manner that has anticompetitive effects."")."
980,20," By contrast, HN8[
] a defense of waiver, equitable estoppel, or fraud in the standard-setting organization context may require 
a showing that the patentee breached a duty of disclosure to the standard-setting organization. See Hynix, 645 F.3d at 1347-48 
(addressing the defenses of waiver and equitable estoppel); Infineon, 318 F.3d at 1096 (addressing the defense of fraud in 
Virginia)."
980,21," Rambus also contends that, in any case, it preserved its internal JEDEC documents. (D.I. 1124 at 14-15) For this argument, it 
relies on (1) the testimony of Crisp, Rambus' principal representative at JEDEC meetings, that the only JEDEC documents he 
discarded were publicly available materials (Id. at 14; see D.I. 1060 at 823:19-824:5, 824:23-825:3, 825:21-826:11); and (2) the 
testimony of Vincent, Rambus' outside patent prosecution counsel, that he maintained his documents regarding JEDEC and 
equitable estoppel issues. (D.I. 1061 at 1369:19-1374:17;  [**53] see also RAMTX 143) Micron has rebutted Rambus' argument 
with contrary testimony in the record and with the assertion that other individuals may have generated documents related to 
Rambus' JEDEC participation. (D.I. 1126 at 13-15) Regardless, the court in Micron I did not make any factual finding that 
Rambus preserved its internal JEDEC-related documents, instead holding that ""the record demonstrates that there were "
981,," [destroyed] documents relevant to"" Micron's JEDEC-based claims and defenses based in part on Rambus' conduct at JEDEC. 
See Micron I, 255 F.R.D. at 150-51 & n.60. The court does not make any new findings of fact in this case on remand. (D.I. 1150 
at 34:19-25, 44:14-45:3)"
981,22," In Exergen, the Federal Circuit held that HN11[
] the heightened standard for pleading inequitable conduct requires that the 
pleading identify the ""who, what, when, where, and how"" of the material misrepresentation or omission allegedly committed 
before the United States Patent and Trademark Office (""PTO""). Exergen, 575 F.3d at 1328. ""At the pleading stage the proponent 
of the inequitable conduct theory need only plead facts supporting a reasonable inference that a specific individual knew of the 
misrepresentation and had the specific intent to deceive the PTO."" Sanders v. Mosaic Co., 418 F. App'x 914, 918 (Fed. Cir. 
2011)."
981,23," Moreover, Exergen was decided after final judgment and notice of appeal were entered for the instant case."
981,24," Prior to remand of the instant case, Rambus' only challenge to Micron's inequitable conduct claim was a motion to dismiss 
based on lack of declaratory  [**56] judgment jurisdiction, which was denied. (D.I. 49) On remand briefing, Rambus makes a de 
facto motion to dismiss and motion for summary judgment based on an alleged lack of merit to the inequitable conduct claims. 
These de facto motions are procedurally improper. "
982,25," Judge Ronald M. Whyte of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California recently issued Findings of 
Facts and Conclusions of Law on Spoliation and the Unclean Hands Defense in Hynix Semiconductor Inc. v. Rambus Inc., No. 
C-00-20905, 897 F. Supp. 2d 939, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135583, 2012 WL 4328999 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 21, 2012). Judge Whyte 
held that the sanction ""most commensurate with Rambus' [spoliation] . . . [was] to strike from the record evidence supporting a 
royalty in excess of a reasonable, non-discriminatory royalty."" 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135583, [WL] at *45. However, Judge 
Whyte's decision is not binding on this court and, in any case, his findings of fact were different from those of the instant case. "
983,26," The selective execution  [**63] of the document retention policy relating to Rambus' position on patentability also increases the 
likelihood that the document destruction interfered with the rightful resolution of the case. "
984,27," In Baliotis, the district court found that the spoliator did not act in bad faith and that the prejudice was not severe because the 
evidence  [**67] destroyed had been captured in scores of photographs and video, plus other evidence central to the products 
liability claim had been preserved. Baliotis, 870 F. Supp. at 1289-93. Accordingly, the court sanctioned the spoliating party with 
the ""lesser sanction"" of an instruction to the jury that it may consider that the lost evidence would be unfavorable to the spoliating 
party. Id. at 1293. In doing so, the court drew a contrast to cases where dispositive sanctions were imposed because the 
destroyed evidence was ""necessary"" or ""absolutely critical."" Id. at 1292 n.11 (citations omitted) (internal quotation marks 
omitted). "
985,28," To the extent an evidentiary sanction would preclude evidence of documents missing from the record, such a sanction would 
be futile. It is Micron, not Rambus, that would seek to introduce the destroyed evidence; to preclude such evidence would not 
remedy the prejudice to Micron but would allow Rambus to succeed in going to trial with an incomplete record."
985,29," Given the egregious nature of Rambus' misconduct, an evidentiary sanction is also troubling in that it would still permit 
Rambus to present its case before a jury."
985,30," As the lesser sanctions are ineffective or inappropriate, the court finds that a combination of those sanctions would similarly be 
ineffective or inappropriate."
985,31," The Federal Circuit also noted a five-factor choice-of-sanction analysis from the Ninth Circuit that considers: (1) the public's 
interest in speedy resolution of litigation, (2) the court's need to manage its docket, (3) risk of prejudice to the non-spoliating 
party, (4) the public policy in favor of deciding cases on their merits, and (5) availability of less severe sanctions. Micron II, 645 
F.3d at 1329 (citing Leon, 464 F.3d at 958). Two of the Leon factors overlap with Schmid (prejudice and lesser sanctions) and, 
although Leon is not binding, the court notes that the other three considerations weigh in favor of a dispositive sanction. First, the public's interest in speedy resolution of litigation weighs in favor of holding the patents-in-suit unenforceable against 
Micron. The instant action has been pending since 2000, and an evidentiary sanction would further delay the case while 
producing the same substantive result. Second, the court's need to manage its docket so that  [**71] judicial resources are being "
986,," used for fair litigation also weighs in favor of a dispositive action. Finally, while the policy of deciding cases on their merits might 
ordinarily disfavor a dispositive sanction, the sheer degree of bad faith and prejudice in this case renders resolution on the merits 
virtually impossible."
986,32," The International Trade Commission (""ITC""), in a recent determination and opinion, also found that the appropriate sanction 
for Rambus' unclean hands was to hold the asserted patents unenforceable. (See D.I. 1136 at 265-317; D.I. 1146 at 51-55) 
Although the patents before the ITC were not the same as the patents-in-suit, the ITC's determination and opinion recognize that 
egregious misconduct can lead to a dispositive sanction. "

MTD""). The Court reminds Plaintiffs that Civil Local Rule 7-4 requires parties to include a table of contents  [*3] and a table of 
authorities in all briefs exceeding ten pages. "
991,2," Plaintiffs object to the Regan Declaration on a number of grounds. First, they argue that Mr. Regan lacks the requisite personal 
knowledge and that his declaration is based on hearsay. Opp'n to 12(b)(1) MTD at 5. Plaintiffs point  [*10] to the first paragraph 
of the declaration, in which Mr. Regan states: ""The following facts are based upon my personal knowledge or are based upon 
information received from persons upon whom I rely in the normal course of business and/or the business records of Regus plc."" 
Id. (quoting Regan Decl. ¶ 1). Contrary to Plaintiffs' contention, Mr. Regan does not lack the requisite personal knowledge 
merely because he may have reached an understanding about some of Regus plc's operations based on his review of business 
records or information gathered from staff. See Great Am. Assur. Co. v. Liberty Surplus Ins. Corp., 669 F. Supp. 2d 1084, 1089 
(N.D. Cal. 2009) (""Personal knowledge includes opinions and inferences grounded in observations and experience.""). Further, 
Mr. Regan's declaration is not hearsay because it is based on Mr. Regan's own understanding and observations and contains no 
out-of-court statements. Plaintiffs also object to Mr. Regan's statements concerning regus.com on the ground that they are 
vague and ambiguous and constitute inadmissible legal conclusions because they interpret the legal significance of online 
interaction through the Regus website. Opp'n to 12(b)(1) MTD at 8.  [*11] This argument is unavailing. The paragraphs targeted 
by Plaintiffs contain straightforward statements of fact, not legal conclusions. "
993,3," Plaintiffs also allege that Defendants are liable for fraud under the UCL because they engaged in false advertising. FAC ¶ 88. 
This UCL claim is identical to Plaintiffs' FAL claim. Compare id. ¶ 88 with id. ¶ 92. Accordingly, it is addressed in Section III.B.iv 
infra. "
1003,1," HN3[
] The Supreme Court has repeatedly emphasized the ""modest scope"" of the doctrine, thus far acknowledging only four types of orders which fall within its purview: orders rejecting absolute immunity, qualified immunity, Eleventh Amendment 
immunity, and double jeopardy claims. Will v. Hallock, 546 U.S. 345, 350, 126 S. Ct. 952, 163 L. Ed. 2d 836 (2006). "
1005,2," A protective order is a more appropriate, orderly, and efficient means to mitigate disruptions to non-parties. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 
26(c)(1). "
1038,1," As discussed below, United States as used in the class definition includes its territories and the District of Columbia. This is 
specified in most but not all of the settlement agreements. Since a single settlement class is being certified for the purpose of 
effectuating  [*77] the global settlement of the litigation, the parties agree and the Special Master concludes that the term United 
States as used in all of the agreements should be construed to include U.S. territories. Further, it is increasingly common usage 
for the term ""United States"" to encompass not only its 50 States and its federal district but also its territories, commonwealths 
and other possessions, see, e.g., Wikipedia, United States, available at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States."
1038,2," As discussed below, this time period is the longest conspiracy period alleged in any of the various cases being settled. "
1040,3," Subsequently, this appeal was stayed as a condition of the global settlements reached in 2010 and will be dismissed upon the 
finality of the settlements. Accordingly, the parties and the Special Master have proceeded without the guidance of the Ninth

1041,7," This Report and Recommendations on the certification of classes for the purpose of settling the claims in this litigation 
addresses only the issue of whether such classes may be certified under the particular facts and circumstances of this case in 
which a global release of all potentially viable claims is required. It does not purport to apply to certification for litigation 
purposes. See, e.g., In re Ford Motor Co. E-350 Van Products Liability Litig., No. Civ. A. 03-4458, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13887, 
2012 WL 379944, *6 n.2 (D.N.J. Feb. 6, 2012). (Precedent on certification of settlement class is distinguishable in the context of 
motion for certification of a litigation class.)"
1041,8," This Report and Recommendations addresses a number of allocation and distribution issues raised by various parties that 
were  [*90] ultimately resolved through negotiation and compromise, such as weighting or ""tiering"" the recoveries of members of 
the Indirect Purchaser Settlement Class to reflect either their position in the chain of distribution or various aspects of the state 
laws under which their damage claims arose. The positions of the parties on these issues are not discussed for the purpose of 
adjudicating their merits, but rather so that the record may show that all important considerations relating to the issues of 
allocation and distribution were fully raised, addressed and considered and were resolved by the crafting of a pro rata plan of 
distribution that is fair, reasonable and adequate under the circumstances of this litigation. See, e.g., In re Literary Works in Elec. 
Databases Copyright Litigation, 654 F.3d 242, 251-53 (2nd Cir. 2011). (Where  [*91] the court remanded a plan of distribution for 
further findings even though there was no determinative evidence that one group of claimants within the settlement class had 
been treated unfairly because the record provided no basis upon which to determine whether a reduction in value applied to their 
claims in the allocation process fairly reflected their weaknesses.) "
1043,9," As used herein, the terms ""repealer"" and ""non-repealer"" refer to whether or not an individual state has amended or construed 
its antitrust or consumer protection laws to permit indirect purchasers to recover for price-fixing damages resulting from the 
pass-on of overcharges in the prices paid for products purchased from an entity other than the price-fixer. States which permit 
this type of recovery are said to have repealed the prohibition enunciated in Illinois Brick v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 97 S. Ct. 2061, 
52 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1977), and are commonly referred to as repealer states. States that do not permit indirect purchaser recovery 
are known as non-repealer states."
1043,10," This includes States whose laws designate their Attorneys General as the sole representative for their consumers in whole or 
in part in bringing antitrust claims."
1043,11," The net settlement fund, as used here, is the amount for distribution to the class after payment of taxes, escrow fees, 
attorneys' fees and expenses, the Special Master's fees and costs  [*101] and any other court approved charges against the 
settlement proceeds (plus any interest earned thereon). "
1044,12," The estimate of actual single damages and the estimates of the value of DRAM in DRAM-containing products will be covered

the claim form and claims processing procedures. "

litigation purposes. "
1047,15, A list of the actions encompassed by the settlements herein is Exhibit 4 to the Appendix hereto.
1047,16," Before consolidation of several complaints and claims into the Petro case, Judge Hamilton dismissed on personal jurisdiction 
grounds the claims made against certain foreign defendants in the following cases filed in state courts and removed to federal 
court: North Carolina actions against Hynix Semiconductor Inc., Nanya Technology Corporation and Winbond Electronics 
Corporation; Tennessee actions against Hynix Semiconductor Inc., Nanya Technology Corporation, Winbond Electronics "
1048,," Corporation and Winbond Electronics Corporation America; and Vermont actions against Hynix Semiconductor Inc., Elpida 
Memory, Inc., Elpida Memory (USA)  [*113] Inc., NEC Electronics Corporation, NEC electronics America, Inc., Winbond 
Electronics Corporation and Winbond Electronics Corporation America. This set of defendants included foreign parent 
corporations and their U.S. subsidiaries."
1048,17," The factual basis for the findings regarding the status of the private litigation is contained in the Declaration of Josef D. Cooper 
in Support of Motion for  [*114] Preliminary Approval of Settlement with Samsung and Winbond, filed on October 10, 2007, a 
copy of which is attached as Exhibit 5 to the Appendix hereto. "
1049,18," The factual basis for the findings regarding the status of the Attorneys General's litigation is contained in the Declaration of 
Emilio E. Varanini in Support of Motion for Preliminary Approval of Settlement with Samsung & Winbond, filed October 10, 2007, 
a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 6 to the Appendix hereto."
1049,19," Neither of these Complaints named Winbond as a defendant. Instead, a separate complaint, captioned State of California et 
al. v. Winbond Electronics Co., Case No. 07-2589 PJH, was filed against Winbond by all of the Attorneys General except New 
York that alleged illegal conduct in Singapore that substantially affected U.S. commerce. The multistate complaint in Infineon did 
not name Samsung as a defendant either; a separate complaint, captioned State of California et al. v. Samsung Electronics Co., 
Ltd. et al., Case No. 07-1347 PJH, was filed against Samsung by the multistate group as part of the settlement with Samsung. "
1050,20," See, e.g., State of California et al. v. Infineon Technologies et. al, 531 F. Supp. 2d 1124 (N.D. Cal. 2007)."

1050,22, Id. at *25. 
1051,23," Id. at *39. The court also noted that there was an intraclass conflict since there were entities that had both indirect purchaser 
claims and direct purchaser claims by operation of assignment included in the proposed litigation class. As will be discussed 
 [*125] below, the Special Master finds and concludes that the inclusion of both types of claims does not create conflicts that 
preclude certification of classes for settlement purposes."
1051,24," The term ""political subdivisions"" includes K-12 school districts, counties, cities and special districts of whatever kind."
1051,25," City of Los Angeles v. Infineon Technologies AG, No. CGC-08-480561 (San Francisco Super. Ct. complaint filed Oct. 3, 
2008). The Class Action Fairness Act only allows removal of such individual civil actions from state court to federal court when 
brought on behalf of 100 or more individual entities. See 28 U.S.C. § 1332(d)(11)(B) (under CAFA, a ""mass action"" is removable 
and ""means any civil action . . . in  [*126] which monetary relief claims of 100 or more persons are proposed to be tried jointly on 
the ground that the plaintiffs' claims involve common questions of law or fact""). Accordingly, the Defendants did not attempt to 
remove this action to federal court."
1051,26," The California Attorney General also filed a number of amicus briefs, both in the Ninth Circuit and in other similar price-fixing 
cases, on the issue of standing in support of the Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs. See, e.g., Cal. Atty. Gen. Amicus Brief re: Antitrust 
Standing in Support of Opposition to Motion to Dismiss, In re Flash Memory Antitrust Litig., No. C 07-0086-SBA (N.D. Cal., filed 
Apr. 30, 2008); State of California Amicus Brief re: Antitrust Standing in Support of Opposition to Motion to Dismiss, In re TFT-

to Motion to Dismiss, In re DRAM Antitrust Litig., M-02-1486 PJH (N.D. Cal., filed July 5, 2007)."
1051,27," Unlike all subsequent settlement agreements, other than the Winbond agreement, the SSA speaks of ""the United States"" 
without defining precisely what it intended to encompass by that term. However, there is nothing in the SSA that indicates that 
the reference to the United States was intended to exclude its territories. Accordingly, the SSA is being construed consistent with 
the other settlement agreements. "
1052,28," SSA ¶¶ 1, 2. Plaintiff states include  [*129] the following states and commonwealths: Alaska, Arizona Arkansas, California,

1052,29," The term ""political subdivisions"" includes K-12 school districts, counties, cities and special districts of whatever kind."
1052,30," The term ""Class States"" as used in this Report and Recommendations refers to those Attorneys General that are seeking in 
whole or in part certification of a class of Government Purchaser Plaintiffs in their States in order to effectuate the settlements, 
including the release. By state statutes, all other Attorneys General, referred to by the term ""Non-Class States,"" do not need 
certification of a class of Government Purchaser Plaintiffs in order to effectuate the settlements, including the release."

1053,41, SSA ¶ 16.
1053,42," A copy of the WSA is attached as Exhibit 9 to the Appendix hereto. Plaintiff State New York, which never filed suit against 
Winbond, is not a party to the WSA. Like the SSA, the WSA does not specifically include U.S. territories within the definition of 
the United States, but will be similarly construed."
1053,43," Unlike the SSA, which provided for two separate settlement funds, one of $80 million for the private party plaintiffs and one of 
$10 million for the government purchaser plaintiffs, the WSA does not specify how this settlement fund is to be allocated 
between the private and the government purchaser plaintiffs. However, as will be discussed below in paragraph 69 in connection 
with the Multi-Defendant settlement, the parties to all subsequent settlement agreements in this litigation determined that the 
relative sizes of the Samsung settlement payments, which were the product of separate arm's length negotiations, represented a 
fair and reasonable allocation of the settlement proceeds between the private party purchasers and the government purchasers 
and the parties to these proceedings before the Special Master agree that this division should also apply to the Winbond 
settlement proceeds."
1053,44, WSA ¶ III.C. 
1054,45," The MDSA was the first settlement agreement to explicitly include U.S. territories within the scope of the settlement class. All 
subsequent settlement agreements also refer to U.S. territories in addition to ""the United States."""
1054,46," MDSA at 2. The Attorneys General referred to in the MDSA represent the states or commonwealths acting in their sovereign 
or proprietary capacity, and the persons and entities therein which they represent acting in their representative or parens patriae 
or other capacity, or acting pursuant to Federal Rule of Procedure 23 as alleged in the  [*138] Third Amended Complaint filed in 
State of California et al. v. Infineon Technologies et al., C 06-4333 (PJH) of the following states or commonwealths: Arizona,

Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin. MDSA ¶ 3. 
This is a slightly smaller number of states than were parties to the SSA and WSA. As will be discussed below, this change is 
reflected in the definitions of the Government Purchaser Settlement Classes."
1054,47, See footnote 32 above.

1054,49, A copy of the MDSA is attached as Exhibit 10 to the Appendix hereto.
1054,50," As set forth in its March 19, 2012, Chapter 15 bankruptcy petition in the United States Bankruptcy Court in Delaware (Ca. No. 
12-10947), defendant Elpida Memory Inc. (""Elpida"") experienced significant losses in 2007 (¥23.5 billion) and 2008 (¥178.9 
billion) that led it to restructure and borrow significant sums in 2009 under government supervision (approximately  [*140] ¥110 
billion). Since then, Elpida has continued to struggle due to the depressed global economy. Uncertain about its ability to make 
upcoming debt payments, Elpida filed for bankruptcy in Tokyo on February 27, 2012. Elpida's U.S. bankruptcy petition did not "
1055,," include Elpida's subsidiary, Elpida Memory (USA), Inc. (""Elpida USA""), which is named independently as a defendant in this 
litigation. Plaintiffs have advised the Special Master that they have done sufficient research into the situation to ascertain that the 
settlement funds deposited into escrow by Elpida USA are not part of the bankruptcy estate. See, e.g., In re Atl. Gulf Cmtys. 
Corp., 369 B.R. 156, 165 (Bankr. D. Del. 2007); 5-541 Collier on Bankruptcy § 541.09A (15th ed. rev. 2004) (""In general, most 
courts have held that assets in escrow are not property of the estate, even though the debtor may have certain rights under an 
escrow agreement and, therefore, in the assets escrowed.""). Neither do they believe that the Elpida settlement funds could be 
considered either a preference or a fraudulent transfer. The settlement payment was made on November 28, 2010, more than a 
year before the bankruptcy filing, so it is outside of the  [*141] term for a preference under § 547 of the Bankruptcy Code. 11 
U.S.C. § 547(b). § 548 of the Bankruptcy Code allows a trustee to go back two years and void certain transfers of the debtor's 
property as ""fraudulent."" However, that requires either a showing of actual intent to defraud creditors, or that the debtor received 
""less than a reasonably equivalent value"" in return for the transfer. 11 U.S.C. § 548(a)(1). Neither showing could be made here. In addition, Elpida has advised the Bankruptcy Court of its desire not to have the bankruptcy proceedings interfere with the 
finalization of this settlement by filing a declaration, dated April 13, 2012, of Kota Takemura, an executive of Elpida, the debtor-
in-possession in the Japanese proceeding. In that declaration, Mr. Takemura lists the settled matters by name and number and 
requests that they be exempted from any stays entered in the bankruptcy proceedings, stating that upon ""final approval"" of the 
settlement ""Elpida and Elpida USA will get the benefit of a final release"" and that ""[s]taying the Antitrust Matter would jeopardize 
the settlement and would be detrimental to Elpida's reorganization and creditors."" (Copies of certain of the  [*142] bankruptcy

1070,100," For those Settling Defendants  [*198] (Hitachi, Toshiba and Mitsubishi) who had already exited the DRAM industry before the 
suits were filed by Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs and Attorneys General, they need only institute a compliance program with 
specific requirements if (a) they do not already have a compliance program as a general matter, and (b) they do not re-enter the 
DRAM industry. This variance, reflecting their long-time exit from the industry, does not affect the appropriateness and value of 
the injunctive relief secured by Settling Plaintiffs. "

captioned AT&T Mobility LLC v. AU Optronics Corporation, No. 11-16188, was set for oral argument on November 9, 2012."
1073,110," Both the Second and Third Circuits have found class settlements permissible even where subsequent legal developments 
conclusively invalidated the underlying claims. See, e.g., Ehrheart v. Verizon Wireless, 609 F.3d 590, 595 (3d Cir. 2010) 
(retroactive statutory amendment to eliminate private right of action did not operate to preclude final approval of class settlement 
by the court because the parties' negotiated agreement remained an enforceable contract); In re Stock Exchange Antitrust Litig., 
317 F.3d 134, 150-51 (2d Cir. 2003)  [*207] (court had jurisdiction to entertain motion for settlement of antitrust claims even 
though affirmative antitrust immunity defense had merit). "
1074,111," The most significant problem presented by certification of a nationwide class based on disparate state-law claims is grouping 
them for trial according to their elements of proof, a problem that is absent in the settlement context. But, even with litigating 
claims arising under states' tort laws, courts  [*212] have found that ""state law does not need to be universal in order to justify 
nationwide class certification."" In re Telectronics Pacing Sys., Inc., 172 F.R.D. 271, 292 (S.D. Ohio 1997). In Telectronics, the 
court addressed variations in state laws invoked for redress by looking for substantial similarity in the ""important/meaningful/ 
significant/pivotal"" issues raised by the respective claims to designate trial subclasses. The same technique was applied to 
organize common issues arising in all cases for class-wide trial in In re Copley Pharmaceutical, Inc., 161 F.R.D. 456, 465-67 (D. 
Wyo. 1995). "
1075,112," This eliminates the need for courts considering settlement class certifications to grapple with such issues as whether or how 
the fact of damage, or ""antitrust impact,"" could be proved on a classwide basis in order to find that common issues predominate. 
Proof of injury has no practical application  [*214] if the defendant has offered compensation to all class members and the case 
is not going to be tried. It therefore falls within the ambit of the manageability concerns that Amchem teaches need not hamper a 
certification for settlement purposes. The Special Master therefore merely notes in discussing the certification of a nationwide 
class of indirect purchasers that the plaintiffs here contend that, as to the settlement class's Cartwright Act claims, Clayworth v. 
Pfizer, 49 Cal. 4th 758, 111 Cal. Rptr. 3d 666, 233 P.3d 1066 (2010) settled any doubt that indirect purchasers of an allegedly 
price-fixed good or service may assert the inference or presumption of injury arising from evidence of the price-fixing that was 
recognized in In re New Motor Vehicles Canadian Exp. Antitrust Litig.., 235 F.R.D. 127, 135 (2006); In re Cipro Cases I & II, 121 
Cal. App. 4th 402, 412-14, 17 Cal. Rptr. 3d 1 (2004); and B.W.I. Custom Kitchen v. Owens-Illinois, Inc., 191 Cal. App. 3d 1341, 
1350-51, 235 Cal. Rptr. 228 (1987)."
1075,113," There is also a third category of states that have enacted ""repealer"" statutes that either permits only  [*217] the Attorney 
General to sue on behalf of indirect purchasers, or limits class actions on behalf of indirect purchasers to those where the 
Attorney General is the proposed class representative. These are the ""AG-only states"" referred to in Section III.B., above."
1075,114," The Illinois Brick Court provided two examples of situations that fall outside of its scope: where the indirect purchaser had ""a 
preexisting cost-plus contract"" and ""where the direct purchaser is owned or controlled by its customer,"" and left open the door for "
1076,," courts to permit recovery in ""[a]nother situation in which market forces have been superseded"" so that traditional notions of 
""pass-on"" are not required to demonstrate injury to the indirect purchaser. Id. at 736 and n.16."
1076,115," ""Because we find Hanover Shoe dispositive here, we do not address the standing issue, except to note, as did the Court of 
Appeals below, 536 F. 2d at 1166, that the question of which persons have been injured by an illegal overcharge for purposes of 
§ 4 is analytically distinct from the question of which persons have sustained injuries too remote to give them standing to sue for 
damages under § 4."" Id. at 728 n.7."
1076,116," Since 1977, there have been numerous examples of cases adjudicating the application of Illinois Brick to the claims of various 
individuals and putative classes. See, e.g., Palmyra Park Hosp. Inc. v. Phoebe Putney Memorial Hosp., 604 F.3d 1291, 
1303-07 (11th Cir. 2010)  [*219] (holding that the plaintiff, a competitor of the defendant, had standing to assert a Section 2 
claim even though the plaintiff never dealt directly with the defendant); In re Lower Lake Erie Iron Ore Antitrust Litig., 998 F.2d 
1144, 1167-68 & n.21 (3d Cir. 1993) (holding that Illinois Brick does not ""announc[e] a strict prohibition against recovery by 
indirect purchasers"" and proceeding with a fact-based inquiry into its applicability in that case)."
1076,117, This is also true of the Government Purchaser Settlement Classes.
1076,118," It should also be noted that at the time the AGC Order was entered, this Court was deciding a question of first impression and 
did not have the benefit of the California Supreme Court's decision in Clayworth v. Pfizer, 49 Cal. 4th 758, 111 Cal. Rptr. 3d 666, 
233 P.3d 1066, or the thinking of other federal district courts which have subsequently declined to similarly apply Associated 
General Contractors to the Cartwright Act and various other state indirect purchaser laws. See, e.g., In re Cathode Ray Tube 
(CRT) Antitrust Litig.., 738 F. Supp. 2d 1011 (N.D. Cal. 2010); In re Flash Memory Antitrust Litig., 643 F. Supp. 2d 1133, 2009 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 38941 (N.D. Cal. 2009); In re TFT-LCD (Flat Panel) Antitrust Litig., 586 F. Supp. 2d 1109 (N.D. Cal. 2008); In 
re Graphics Processing Units Antitrust Litig.., 527 F. Supp. 2d 1011 (N.D. Cal. 2007). In addition, the AGC Order was not applied 
to the parens patriae claims of the Attorneys General, which are being settled in conjunction with the class action claims, and 
Associated General Contractors cannot in the views of many of those Attorneys  [*223] General as expressed to the Special 
Master, be extended to the parens patriae claims of a number of them in this litigation. See, e.g., In re Tobacco Cases II, 46 Cal. 
4th 298, 305, 314, 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d 559, 207 P.3d 20 (2009) (actions of California Attorney General under Unfair Competition 
Law not subject to standing requirements); THE STATE BAR OF CALIFORNIA ANTITRUST AND UNFAIR COMPETITION LAW SECTION, 
CALIFORNIA STATE ANTITRUST LAW AND UNFAIR COMPETITION LAW, § 14.02 [E], 514-15 (2009 ed.) (doubtful that AGC standing 
requirement applies to parens patriae antitrust claim of California Attorney General given federal precedent on issue). "
1077,," For the reasons discussed above, Sullivan teaches that courts need not wade through the comparative merits of these decisions 
when certifying a settlement class whose claims, regardless of comparative strengths or weaknesses, all arise from a common 
core of conduct and seek redress for the same type of economic harm."
1077,119," In re Air Cargo Shipping Services Antitrust Litigation, MD-06-1775, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 107882, *124, 206 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 
26, 2008), rec. adopted, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 97365 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 21, 2009)."

litigation context)."
1077,121," Amchem, 521 U.S. at 620. "
1078,122," Interestingly, no settlement subclasses were ever certified in the Pet Food litigation. The district court interpreted its mandate 
from the circuit as an instruction ""'to determine whether the $250,000 allocated to Purchase Claims was fair, reasonable and 
adequate.' (Third Cir. Op. at 55-56.)"" rather than an instruction  [*229] to certify subclasses. It therefore requested briefing from 
all parties on the fairness of the settlement allocation to claimants with Purchase Claims. In re Pet Food Prods. Liab. Litig., MDL 
No. 1850, Civ. Action No. 07-2867 (NLH), 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 38181, *50 (D.N.J. Apr. 5, 2011). The plaintiffs and defendants 
settled with the objectors who had taken the appeal and the district court determined that the record made by the plaintiffs and 
defendants was sufficient to ensure that the interests of the Purchaser Claims claimants was adequately represented. "
1079,123," The term ""Class States"" was coined during the proceedings before the Special Master to identify those states who are 
seeking to utilize the class action device to represent certain Government Purchaser Plaintiffs within their borders, and to 
distinguish them from the Non-Class States who represent their Government Purchaser Plaintiffs in a proprietary capacity. There 
are many other government purchasers covered by the settlements who will share in the proceeds of the settlements as a result 
of the direct representation of those entities  [*234] by their respective state Attorneys General without resorting to the class 
action device. The distribution of the settlement funds to those entities is beyond the purview of the reference to the Special 
Master."
1079,124, A copy of this letter-brief is attached as Exhibit 26 to the Appendix hereto.
1079,125," The Special Master finds by way of clarification that the term ""political subdivisions"" encompasses all non-state and non-
federal government entities of whatever kind in a given state except for colleges and universities. See, e.g., Cal. Const. Art. IX, § 
14 (school districts); id. Art. XI, § 1 (counties); id. § 2, 5 (cities); id. §7 (counties and cities); id. § 9 (municipal corporations or 
utilities); Wells v. One2One Learning Foundation, 39 Cal. 4th 1164, 1195, 1201, 48 Cal. Rptr. 3d 108, 141 P.3d 225 (2006) 
(discussing K-12 school districts as being political subdivisions); Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. v. County of Stanislaus, 16 Cal. 4th 
1143, 1151, 69 Cal. Rptr. 2d 329, 947 P.2d 291 (1997) (discussing counties specifically and political subdivisions generally 
under the Cartwright Act); Trimont Land Corp. v. Truckee Sanitary Dist., 145 Cal. App. 3d 330, 342-43, 347, 193 Cal. Rptr. 568 
(1983) (discussing the two types of special districts, municipal corporations and public corporations,  [*235] within municipal 
corporations being able to act outside of the territorial limits of the municipality establishing them); Cal. Gov. Code, §§ 12650 
(example of political subdivisions including cities, counties, K-12 school districts and special districts), 23000 (counties), 34100 
(cities include chartered cities and general law cities). Colleges and universities are carved out as a sub-group within these 
proposed settlement classes from state or local government entities only because they are handled differently in the allocation 
process devised by Class and Non-Class States. Otherwise, by way of illustrative example only, the term ""political subdivisions"" 
would include local K-12 school districts, counties, cities and special districts of whatever kind. "
1080,126," For Class State Alaska, only the following political subdivisions are part of this proposed class: the City of Anchorage, the City 
of Fairbanks and the City of Juneau. Colleges and universities in the State of Alaska are not part of the proposed settlement 
class."
1080,127," The State of New Mexico is representing state government entities in a non-class capacity for purposes of settlement. Class 
State California recently confirmed that colleges  [*236] and universities in Class State New Mexico are state government 
entities and so are also being represented in a non-class capacity for purposes of the settlement. See, e.g., Letter-Brief to the 
Special Master submitted on March 21, 2012, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 27 to the Appendix hereto."
1080,128," The State of California is representing state government entities in a non-class capacity for purposes of settlement with the

why a nationwide class of Government Purchasers should include Alaska, Delaware, Ohio and Pennsylvania as to all other 
Settling Defendants, even for settlement purposes."
1081,133," Subsequent to the denial of California and New Mexico's motion to certify classes of government entities for litigation 
purposes, the California Attorney General, using the authority granted to her by California Business & Professions Code Section 
16750(c), brought individual claims on behalf of 97 local government entities, as well as the University of California. See First 
Amended Complaint, City of Los Angeles et al. v. Infineon Technologies et al. (Cal. Super. Ct. San Francisco Feb. 4, 2009) (No. 
GCC-08-480561). These claims are also being released. As discussed below, the Special Master finds the decision of the State 
of California to seek certification of a settlement class including these entities is superior to proceeding with the allocation 
 [*240] and distribution of settlement proceeds on the basis of these individual claims."
1081,134," The record contains 2002 Census data on government entities in California and New Mexico, as to which judicial notice

Mexico for purchases as well as individuals in both California and New Mexico familiar with purchasing practices of local and 
state government entities. Insofar as the other Class States may be concerned, their class representatives are the States 
themselves. Unless the injuries of the States themselves differ in material respects from those of other government entities, the 
States are considered to be typical and adequate representatives of a government entity class. See, e.g., In re Ampicillin 
Antitrust Litig., 55 F.R.D. 269, 274 (D.C. Cir. 1972) (""States may certainly represent their lesser government entities.""); State of

Class State California recently submitted declarations from the Attorneys General of Class States Alaska, Delaware and 
Pennsylvania that clarified that their States not only were class representatives but also that they purchased in a unitary fashion 
similar to their local government entities such that there is evidence in the record supporting the Special Master's finding here

individual issues. Id. "
1086,157," This Court's ruling that rejected the litigation class certification motion filed by California and New Mexico was grounded, in 
part, on a finding that a class action was not superior to individual actions. However, that determination was based upon the 
difficulties likely to be encountered in the management of the class action as preventing a finding of superiority. This Court 
acknowledged that the first three factors for assessing superiority, which are the only factors relevant to a settlement class,

whom taxes are levied do not always pay the taxes."" Id. at 8. Where, for example, suppliers are targeted for the tax, if demand 
for the taxed product is inelastic—meaning that buyers are not sensitive to price changes, perhaps because of a lack of 
substitutes—then the suppliers of the taxed product will be able to ""pass on"" much of the cost of the tax in the form of higher 
prices to consumers without incurring substantial declines in quantity demanded. On the other hand, if demand for the product is "

plaintiffs' claims, which were that 66 million nationwide subscribers of defendant AOL's services were the victims of an allegedly 
unlawful advertising campaign that exploited their outgoing e-mail messages. Id. at 1040-41. The Ninth Circuit also reasoned 
that, as two-thirds of the cy pres donations were going to local charities located in Los Angeles  [*355] that had little to do with 
the Internet, it was not clear how anyone in the nationwide class, even those located in Los Angeles, would benefit from the cy 
pres distribution plan. Id. The Ninth Circuit rejected the argument of the parties that adequate charities could not be identified, 
noting that ""[t]he parties should not have trouble selecting beneficiaries from any number of non-profit organizations that work to 
protect Internet users from fraud, predation, and other forms of online misfeasance."" Id. at 1041."

injunctive relief in the form of a notice and opt-out process. Id. at 1036-37. As all of the parties agreed that the maximum amount 
of damages which the plaintiffs would receive at trial would be $2 million (on an unjust enrichment theory) and as a pro rata 
distribution of those damages would amount to  [*356] $0.03 per plaintiff, the parties agreed to a suggestion of the district court 
judge that AOL make a series of charitable donations. Id. Because the parties claimed they could not identify any charitable 
organization that would benefit the class or would be specifically germane to the issues in the case, they agreed with the 
suggestion of the district court that donations be made to local charitable organizations in Los Angeles. Id. "

1113,228," Also following Levi-Strauss, the California parens statute was amended to provide that ""[i]n exercising its discretion, the court

chapter."" See Historical and Statutory Notes to § 16760(e)(1), Stats.2001, c. 74 (A.B.260)."
1113,229," 107 Cal. App. 4th at 830 & n.2. It should be noted, however, that while there is no authority compelling a direct distribution 
based  [*364] on the assumption that only a small fraction of a consumer class will submit claims, courts have approved plans of 
distribution predicted on educated estimates of a claims result. Indeed, the Third Circuit en banc panel in Sullivan, 667 F.3d at 
327 & n.60, affirmed final approval of such a plan. In addition, as discussed above, a claims rate target of not more than 5 million 
small claimants made by the negotiating parties here forms the basis of their agreement to allocate $50 million for a direct 
distribution to small claimants. These cases reflect a trial court's wide latitude to fashion a plan of distribution according to the 
specific case situation before it. "

on overcharges for DRAM-containing equipment. However, there is no need to approve the proposed distribution plan as to New 
Mexico's state agencies because those agencies are not part of the class. "

] Federal Rule of Evidence 201 authorizes a court to take judicial notice of ""matters of public record,"" Mack v. S. Bay Beer Distrib., 798 F.2d 1279, 1282 (9th Cir.1986), or any other ""adjudicative"" facts, which are ""facts concerning the immediate 
parties."" See United States v. Gould, 536 F.2d 216, 219 (8th Cir. 1976); In re Homestore.com, Inc. Sec. Lit., 347 F. Supp. 2d 
814, 816-17 (C.D. Cal. 2004). In addition, HN10[
] on a motion to dismiss, a court may review material outside the pleadings 
where ""the plaintiff's claim depends on the contents of a document, the defendant attaches the document to its motion to 
dismiss, and the parties do not  [*18] dispute the authenticity of the document, even though the plaintiff does not explicitly allege 
the contents of that document in the complaint."" Knievel v. ESPN, 393 F.3d 1068, 1076 (9th Cir. 2005) (citation omitted). In 
addition, although a court must accept as true all material allegations in the complaint when considering a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, 
""a court need not. . . accept as true allegations that contradict matters properly subject to judicial notice or by exhibit."" Sprewell 
v. Golden StateWarriors, 266 F.3d 979, 988 (9th Cir. 2001). The ""For Household Use Only"" admonition appears in the Crock-
Pot Owner's Manual, of which defendant has requested the Court take judicial notice. Def.'s Request for Judicial Notice, Ex. 1. 
Because plaintiff has not objected to defendant's request nor the authenticity of this exhibit, and because plaintiff incorporated 
the Owner's Manual by reference in her allegations, the Court GRANTS defendant's request."
1145,2," Thus, the Court also finds plaintiff's allegation of reliance to be insufficient to meet the requirements of Rule 9(b). Plaintiff 
alleges that she ""reasonably relied"" on the representations allegedly contained on defendant's packaging in making  [*19] her 
purchasing decision, including the statement that the Crock-Pot was safe for ""household use."" SAC ¶¶ 64-66. But absent plaintiff 
pleading her representations with particularity, plaintiff's allegations of reliance also fall short. The Court notes that plaintiff does 
appear to plead causation, alleging that had she known about the temperature that the surface of the Crock-Pot could allegedly 
reach, ""she would not have purchased"" or ""paid as much"" for the device. Id. ¶ 92. "
1149,3," Plaintiff also argues in passing, without citation to authority, that defendant's clause limiting consumer remedies is an 
unconscionable contract of adhesion. See SAC ¶ 122 (alleging procedural and substantive unconscionability on the basis of 
defendant's fraudulent concealment of information). Plaintiff's allegations are insufficient to overcome the express terms of the 
warranty, as plaintiff's allegation of ""fraudulent concealment"" is unsupported by the remainder of her SAC. See Tietsworth, 720 
F. Supp. 2d at 1138-39 (concluding that a claim of unconscionability is without merit where the plaintiffs ""fail to allege facts 
demonstrating that there were no alternative manufacturers of [the goods] or that they were surprised by the terms of the

1166,2," In their papers, Plaintiffs argue that, if the Court does take judicial notice of a Fannie Mae Servicing Guide, see Docket No. 62 
(RJN, Ex. A) (Fannie Mae Servicing Guide for 2006 and 2011), then that document establishes Fannie Mae's authorization of 
Wells Fargo's unlawful conduct. Plaintiffs point out that the Servicing Guide contains the following statement: ""'The contracts with 
the borrower should include information . . . that the servicer or one of its affiliates may be paid a commission.'"" Docket No. 69 
(Opp'n at 8). This argument has several problems. First, the Court agrees with Plaintiffs that it is questionable whether the 
Servicing Guide may be judicially noticed. Second, even if the document could be judicially noticed, Plaintiffs have not in their 
FAC objected to the fact of a commission per se; rather, their theory is that there are no true commissions (and there are only 
illegal kickbacks instead) because Wells Fargo gets a percentage of the premiums for providing no services at all — insurance is 
automatically placed with ASIC."
1166,3, Some of these arguments are echoed in Fannie Mae and Assurant's papers as well.

Arsberry v. Illinois, 244 F.3d 558, 562 (7th Cir. 2001) (noting that the filed-rate doctrine ""is based both on historical antipathy to "
1167,," rate setting by courts, deemed a task they are inherently unsuited to perform competently, and on a policy of forbidding price 
discrimination by public utilities and common carriers""). "
1168,5," The Court also notes that HN7[
] several courts have expressly rejected the filed-rate doctrine where the plaintiffs have 
articulated a kickback claim predicated on RESPA. The rationale is typically that used by Judge Alsup in Kay v. Wells Fargo & 
Co., 247 F.R.D. 572 (N.D. Cal. 2007): Statutes like RESPA are enacted to protect consumers from unfair business practices by giving consumers a private right 
of action against service providers. Plaintiffs may not sue under the veil of RESPA if they  [**30] simply think that the price 
they paid for their settlement services was unfair. Alternatively, plaintiffs bringing a suit under RESPA may allege a violation 
of fair business practices through the use of illegal kickback payments. The filed-rate doctrine bars suit from the former 
class of plaintiffs and not the latter. Id. at 576; see also Alston v. Countrywide Fin. Corp., 585 F.3d 753, 764-65 (3d Cir. 2009); Reed v. Washington Mut., Inc., No.

exclude a property insurance premium from the finance  [**53] charge if certain conditions are met. "
1175,10," Notably, in an earlier opinion, the Travis court took note of this very Commentary. The court only found the Commentary 
inapplicable because at issue in Travis was the forced purchase of default insurance, not the forced purchase of property 
insurance. See Travis v. Boulevard Bank, N.A., No. 93 C 6847, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14615, at *28 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 13, 1994)

1184,15," Arguably, Wells Fargo cannot invoke the jury waiver provision in the mortgage because it is not a party to the mortgage

1223,1," A review of one version of the sales and verification scripts, dated October 25, 2007, shows that a complete telemarketing call 
proceeded as follows. In the sales portion of the call, the  [*4] operator would begin by introducing himself or herself and 
describing the e-fax services. The operator would then inform the consumer of the cost of the e-fax services ($45.95) and the 
consumer's right to cancel the service. The operator would then ask the consumer the following two questions: ""Are you 18 
years or older and duly authorized by the telephone account owner to make changes to and/or incur charges on this telephone 
account, correct? (response). Are you ready to purchase this very valuable and practical service? (response)."" (Mot., Ex. A, at 
22). Then, after informing the consumer that the product materials will arrive in 7 to 10 business days and that the consumers 
can call its Customer Service Department with any questions or to cancel the service, the operator would transfer the call to 
another operator at Verification Resources to ""confirm [the customer's] information and complete the activation process."" (Id.). During the verification process, the operator would begin by informing the consumer that ""the $49.95 will appear on your monthly 
telephone bill automatically each month, unless of course you give us a call to cancel. These charges will appear on the ILD 
Teleservices  [*5] bill page as being billed on behalf of Advanced Business Services."" (Id. at 23). After obtaining assurance from 
the consumer that he or she ""understand[s] that Advanced Business Services is not affiliated with your local company,"" the 
operator would proceed by asking whether he or she can ""start your business on the Advanced Business Services plan? (must 
get a clear affirmative)."" The operator would then proceed to ask 6 verification questions: (1) ""I have your name as     (read full 
name, first, last).     Is this correct? (response)""; (2) ""I have your business name as . Is this correct? (response)""; (3) ""I show your 
mailing address as     (include street, apt#, city, state and zip). Is this correct? (response)""; (4) ""Your business telephone number 
is     (include area code). Is this correct? (response)""; (5) ""You are requesting Advanced Business Services for this number only, 
correct? (response) (yes, right or correct)""; (6) ""And You are 18 years or older and duly authorized by the telephone account 
owner to make changes to and/or incur charges on this telephone account, correct? (response) (yes, right or correct)."" (Id. at 
23). If the customer affirmed the purchase, the operator  [*6] would then conclude the call by informing the consumer of the 
contact information of ABS's Customer Service Department. "
1225,2," The contract between ABS and Solution Marketing provides that ""[a]ll scripts must be PRE-APPROVED by ABS before their 
use and Solutions agrees that such approved scripts will be read verbatim and that it will train its agents to read such scripts

1225,3," In his deposition, the representative of ABS acknowledged that the components of the Authorization Question, i.e., having the 
customers ""acknowledge[] that they are 18 years of age or older and . . . acknowledge that they are authorized to incur charges 
on that telephone account,"" are ""two pieces [of information] that are absolutely fundamentally required."" (Mot., Ex. B, at 89:2-6). "
1226,4," We note  [*16] that while Plaintiff's Reply appears to characterize the verification script as containing multiple ""compound, 
confusing and misleading questions,"" (see Reply 15), our review of the verification script shows that the only question 
susceptible to such characterization is the Authorization Question, as even Plaintiff concedes that the Authorization Question is 
the only question in the verification script that is compound. (Mot. 5-6). "
1227,5," We note that as the party bearing the burden of establishing class certification requirements, Plaintiff made no effort to 
distinguish between the analytical framework among the three prongs. To the extent Plaintiff's UCL claim under the unlawful 
prong ""borrows"" from Defendants' alleged violation of the California Public Utility Code § 2890, Plaintiff fails to establish 
commonality as discussed below. To the extent that the fraudulent prong poses an objective inquiry, we conclude that Plaintiff 
still cannot establish commonality. Because Plaintiff fails to offer significant proof that the script as a whole is misleading as a 
matter of law, as discussed above, the inquiry under the fraudulent prong is whether each conversation, on the whole and as it 
occurred, was likely to deceive a reasonable consumer. This inquiry is not susceptible to classwide  [*19] resolution in one 
stroke. As to the unfairness prong, we observe that Plaintiff cannot establish a UCL claim under the unfairness prong as a matter 
of law because the allegation of cramming by Defendants does not involve an incipient violation of an antitrust law. See Durell 
v. Sharp Healthcare, 183 Cal. App. 4th 1350, 1365-66, 108 Cal. Rptr. 3d 682 (Ct. App. 2010) (reasoning that Cel-Tech's

1227,6," While Plaintiff refers to the BBB complaints in the Motion, it did not specifically cite these complaints in support of its §

Plaintiff relies on these complaints in support of this claim, Defendants' responses to these complaints tend to show that they did "
1228,," not have a policy of dilatory response or a policy of issuing only single-month refunds. Instead, at least on some occasions, 
Defendants may have timely addressed the complaints and issued multi-month credits. (See Mot., Ex. M, at 245 (""Upon receipt 
of a telephone call from [customer x] on 3/29/08[,] we cancelled the account . . . and issued a credit in the amount of $49.95 plus 
tax. We also at her request called and played the voice print for her review on 4/2/08; at that time we also issued a credit for the 
remaining charge. There were a total of two charges to her account in the amount of $49.95 each.""); id. at 254 (""We received a 
telephone call to our customer service call center on 7/8/09 from [customer y] stating that  [*23] [customer y] is an unauthorized 
employee and that she did not wish to continue the services. We cancelled the account and issued (8) credits . . . in the amount 
of $49.95 each plus tax to the telephone service provider.""); id. at 236 (""On 9/9/2008 we received a letter from [customer z] 
requesting the service be cancelled[.] [The letter] stat[ed] that [customer z] was not authorized to add charges to the telephone 
account. We immediately cancelled the account and issued a full credit of $299.70 for all monthly billings."")). Plaintiff has not 
offered any evidence to rebut Defendants' assertions in these responses. Thus, on this record, Plaintiff has failed to satisfy its 
burden in offering ""significant proof"" of a common practice of dilatory response by Defendants."
1228,7," Plaintiff actually states that Defendants violated ""2890(d)(2)(E)."" (Mot. 21). However, since subsection (d)(2)(E) does not exist,

""Reliant provided notice of a regulatory filing and certification to Abbott in February 2004."" (J.A. at 137.) The record is unclear 
what certification Reliant made, and it is also unclear what the consequences of not making a certification would have been for 
Reliant. Neither party contends that such failure is relevant here."
1237,7," In its Complaint, Ethypharm says  [**10] that ""Abbott responded in writing [to Reliant's regulatory filings] with a thinly-veiled 
threat to bring suit."" (J.A. at 137.) "
1238,8," The STS also provided for a specific set of products that could be manufactured by Reliant: [T]he 43 mg, 87 mg and 130 mg fenofibrate capsule products that are the subject of Reliant's New Drug Application 21-695, 
as supplemented and/or amended from time to time. Reliant Products do not include (i) any pharmaceutical products where 
fenofibrate is not the sole active ingredient, (ii) any combination therapy products or (iii) any products in a form other than a 
43 mg, 87 mg or 130 mg fenofibrate capsule. (J.A. at 246.) Thus, the STS would not allow Reliant to create new doses or combination drugs that would be covered by the 
non-exclusive license."
1238,9," The STS defines Net Sales as ""the gross invoiced sales of the Reliant Products in the Territory under the License Agreement ... 
."" (J.A. at 244.) The STS defines the Reliant Products to be ""the 43 mg, 87 mg and 130 mg fenofibrate capsule products that are 
the subject of Reliant's New Drug Application 21-695 ... ."" (J.A. at 246.)"
1238,10," The STS referred to this as a ""Change of Control,"" which was to include ""the sale, lease, exchange, license or other 
disposition of  [**13] all or substantially all of such Reliant['s] assets related to ... [Antara] and ... Reliant['s] other assets ... .""; ""a 
merger, consolidation, share exchange or similar corporate transaction as a result of which the holders of"" Reliant's stock no 
longer owned the company; or ""the acquisition"" of Reliant by any person or company. (J.A. at 249.)"
1238,11," HN6[
] Although called a ""New Drug Application,"" an approved NDA is no longer an ""application"" in the commonly understood sense of the word. It is, rather, the approval to participate in the United States pharmaceutical market. See 21 C.F.R. 
§ 314.105(a) (explaining that once notice of an approved application is received by letter, marketing of the drug may begin, 
unless the FDA or some other provision of law has delayed that effective date). The rights to an NDA are readily transferrable 
between owners, so long as the new owners comply with certain regulatory requirements. See id. § 314.72(a) (""An 
 [**15] applicant may transfer ownership of its application.""); id. § 314.72(b) (""The new owner shall advise FDA about any 
change in the conditions in the approved application under § 314.70 ... .""). "
1239,12," The District Court did grant Abbott's motion to dismiss Ethypharm's  [**18] ""unlawful restraint of trade"" claim. Specifically, 
Abbott contended that Delaware's Antitrust Act, which codified a restraint of trade claim, see Del. Code Ann. tit. 6, § 2103, 
preempted a common law restraint of trade claim. Ethypharm failed to respond to that argument, and the Court concluded that 
that failure doomed the claim. (See J.A. at 43 (dismissing Ethypharm's restraint of trade claim because it failed to ""articulate in 
some manner how its pleading meets the legal requirements of its claims""). "
1240,13," The District Court also granted summary judgment in favor of Abbott on  [**19] Ethypharm's sham litigation claims. Ethypharm 
does not dispute that determination on appeal. In addition, the District Court granted summary judgment in favor of Abbott on Ethypharm's state law claims. With respect to 
those claims, Ethypharm says, in a footnote at the close of its Opening Brief before us, that the District Court dismissed its state 
law claims without articulating a basis for that ruling. (See Appellant's Opening Br. at 61 n.27 (""The district court's decision did 
not separately address Ethypharm's three remaining state common law claims for unfair competition."").) In response, Abbott 
states it ""is clear [as to why] the district court decided to dismiss the state law claims: Ethypharm cannot prove injury in fact."" 
(Appellee's Br. at 58-59; J.A. at 20.) We have consistently held that HN9[
] ""[a]n issue is waived unless a party raises it in its 
opening brief, and for those purposes a passing reference to an issue ... will not suffice to bring that issue before this court."" 
Laborers' Int'l Union of N. Am., AFL-CIO v. Foster Wheeler Energy Corp., 26 F.3d 375, 398 (3d Cir. 1994) (internal quotation 
marks omitted); see John Wyeth & Bro. Ltd. v. CIGNA Int'l Corp., 119 F.3d 1070, 1076 (3d Cir. 1997)  [**20] (""[A]rguments 
raised in passing (such as, in a footnote), but not squarely argued, are considered waived.""); see also SmithKline Beecham 
Corp. v. Apotex Corp., 439 F.3d 1312, 1320 n.6 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (""[A]rguments raised in footnotes are not preserved.""). Thus, 
Ethypharm waived its appeal of its state law claims. And because of Ethypharm's waiver, and because the District Court had 
diversity jurisdiction over those state law claims, see infra note 14, we will not disturb the District Court's grant of summary 
judgment for Abbott with respect to Ethypharm's state law claims."
1240,14," The District Court had jurisdiction over the federal antitrust claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and over the state law claims 
both as pendent claims pursuant to § 1367, and under diversity jurisdiction pursuant to § 1332 because Ethypharm is a French 
company, Abbott is an Illinois corporation, and the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000. We have jurisdiction under 28 
U.S.C. § 1291. HN10[
] Our review of the District Court's denial of Abbott's motion to dismiss for lack of standing is plenary. Fowler v. UPMC Shadyside, 578 F.3d 203, 206 (3d Cir. 2009). We take as true all the  [**21] factual allegations in the Complaint and the 
reasonable inferences that can be drawn from those facts, Sheridan v. NGK Metals Corp., 609 F.3d 239, 262 n.27 (3d Cir. 
2010), but we disregard legal conclusions and ""[t]hreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere 
conclusory statements,"" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009). ""To survive a motion to 
dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its 
face."" Sheridan, 609 F.3d at 262 n.27 (internal quotation marks omitted). ""A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads 
factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged."" Id. 
(internal quotation marks omitted)."
1240,15," Although  [**22] Abbott did not file a cross-appeal, its standing argument is properly before us because it is ""well established 
that HN11[
] an appellee may, without taking a cross-appeal, support the judgment as entered through any matter appearing in 
the record, though his argument may attack the lower court's reasoning or bring forth a matter overlooked or ignored by the 
court."" EF Operating Corp. v. Am. Bldgs., 993 F.2d 1046, 1048 (3d Cir. 1993). We have held that antitrust standing ""is simply 
another element of proof for an antitrust claim, rather than a predicate for asserting a claim in the first place."" Sullivan v. DB 
Invs., Inc., 667 F.3d 273, 307 (3d Cir. 2011) (en banc), cert. denied, 132 S. Ct. 1876, 182 L. Ed. 2d 646 (2012). Thus, by that 
reasoning, failure to establish antitrust standing is a merits issue properly before us. "
1241,16," HN13[
] Section 4 of the Clayton Act provides the statutory authorization for a private antitrust suit: ""[A]ny person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws"" may maintain a private action for 
treble damages."" 15 U.S.C. § 15."
1241,17," Although not free from debate, we have explained that HN14[
] antitrust standing is based on prudential principles. See W. Penn Power Co., 147 F.3d at 264 (""Thus, the crux of the issue in this case is whether the City satisfies the 'prudential' 
requirements of standing; that is, does the City have 'antitrust standing,' and is the plaintiff a proper party to bring a private 
antitrust action?""); see also Palmyra Park Hosp. Inc. v. Phoebe Putney Mem'l Hosp., 604 F.3d 1291, 1299 (11th Cir. 2010) 
(""To have antitrust standing,  [**24] a party must do more than meet the basic 'case or controversy' requirement that would 
satisfy constitutional standing; instead, the party must show that it satisfies a number of prudential considerations aimed at 
preserving the effective enforcement of the antitrust laws."" (internal quotation marks omitted)); cf. Erwin Chemerinski, Federal 
Jurisdiction § 2.3.6 (5th ed. 2007) (explaining prudential standing requirement that a plaintiff be within the zone of interest 
protected by a statute). We have also indicated, however, that, at least in a state law context, antitrust standing is a kind of 
""statutory standing."" Sullivan, 667 F.3d at 307 (characterizing state law antitrust claims as involving ""statutory standing""). In this 
case, whether the standing inquiry is characterized as ""prudential"" or ""statutory"" makes no difference because neither deprives 
us of Article III jurisdiction and both bar a plaintiff's ability to recover. "
1242,18," Abbott's argument relies heavily on our non-precedential opinion in SigmaPharm, Inc. v. Mutual Pharm. Co., 454 F. App'x 64 
(3d Cir. 2011). We do not  [**29] address that case, see HN17[
] 3d Cir. I.O.P. 5.7 (2010) (""The court by tradition does not cite 
to its not precedential opinions as authority.""), but instead look to the case upon which SigmaPharm rests its reasoning, our 
precedential opinion in Barton & Pittinos. "
1243,19," Not only did Ethypharm choose not to initially enter the United States market with Antara, it passed on a second opportunity to 
do so when it declined to exercise its right of first refusal at the time Reliant transferred its rights in Antara, complete  [**34] with 
the approved NDA. "
1244,20," Ethypharm cites a district court case, Chemi SpA v. GlaxoSmithKline, 356 F. Supp. 2d 495 (E.D. Pa. 2005), in support of its 
position that it has antitrust standing. That decision, however, fails to consider Barton & Pittinos under the antitrust injury prong 
of antitrust standing. It also appears to rest its decision on the ""inextricably intertwined"" theory of antitrust injury, which we 
conclude is lacking in this case, see infra. In addition, the plaintiff in that case, a foreign drug manufacturer, filed a Drug Master 
File with the FDA and ""set forth other required information for FDA approval"" of its drug. Id. at 497. Therefore, the plaintiff's 
involvement in the FDA approval process distinguishes ChemiSpA from this case."
1244,21," The ""inextricably intertwined"" antitrust injury originated in Blue Shield of Virginia v. McCready, 457 U.S. 465, 102 S. Ct. 2540, 
73 L. Ed. 2d 149 (1982). There, the Court recognized that antitrust injury may be suffered by those other than competitors when 
the ""injury alleged is so integral an aspect"" of the alleged anticompetitive conduct that ""the loss was precisely the type of loss 
that the claimed violations ... would be likely to cause."" Id. at 479 (omission in original) (internal quotation marks omitted). It went 
on to conclude that that test had been met because ""the injury [the plaintiff] suffered was inextricably intertwined with the injury 
the conspirators sought to inflict."" Id. at 484. Thus, HN20[
] an ""inextricably intertwined"" antitrust injury is limited to plaintiffs 
""whose injuries are the essential means by which defendants' illegal conduct brings about its ultimate injury to the marketplace."" 
IIA Philip E. Areeda, et al., Antitrust Law: An Analysis of Antitrust Principles and Their Application ¶ 339, at 123 (3d ed. 2007). "
1245,22," Because we conclude that Ethypharm did not suffer antitrust injury, we do not address any of the other AGC factors in the 
antitrust standing analysis. Nor do we reach the issue of whether the District Court erred in its analysis of the merit of Abbott's 
motion for summary judgment. "
1255,1," Plaintiffs assert claims on behalf of a subclass who, by virtue of their purchase of the Class Vehicles for ""personal, family or 
household purposes"" may assert claims under the California's Consumer Legal Remedies Act. (FAC  [*2] ¶ 44.) "
1256,2, Otherwise undesignated paragraph  [*3] references are to the FAC.
1256,3," Plaintiffs allege the extended warranty, communicated through a technical service bulletin (or ""TSB"") to dealers, applied only to 
the front brakes. During the second year or 12,000 through 24,000 miles, the applicable deductible was $50, and during the third 
year of 24,000 through 36,000 miles, the applicable deductible $100. (FAC at 3 n. 4.)"
1256,4, Plaintiff Coleman did not purchase his Journey in California. (See Motion at 1; Def.'s RJN Ex. A.) 
1261,5," At oral argument, defense counsel argued that Plaintiff Coleman did not allege failure to repair during the initial 12,000 mile 
period. This is incorrect. (¶ 22 (""Despite Mr. Coleman's complaint, the dealer failed to repair the defect herein alleged for free 
under warranty.  [*21] As a result, the brake pulsation and vibration continued unabated and in fact worsened over time."").) "
1262,6," Chrysler also moves to strike because the text is ""irrelevant."" In this  [*24] context, ""irrelevant"" is synonymous with ""immaterial."" "
1264,1," Plaintiffs also named the competitors as codefendants, and continue to prosecute their claims against those defendants in the 
trial court."
1264,2," The Cartwright Act embodies California's antitrust law, and defines an illegal ""trust"" as ""a combination of capital, skill or acts 
by two or more persons"" for the purpose of fixing prices or inhibiting competition. (Bus. & Prof. Code, § 16720.)"
1264,3," ""'""Since the Cartwright Act and the federal Sherman Act share similar language and objectives, California courts often look to 
federal precedents under the Sherman Act for guidance.""'"" (In re Cipro Cases I & II (2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 442, 456-457, 134 "
1265,," Cal. Rptr. 3d 165, quoting Fisherman's Wharf Bay Cruise Corp. v. Superior Court (2003) 114 Cal.App.4th 309, 334, 7 Cal. Rptr. 
3d 628.) "
1266,4," Plaintiffs' fifth amended complaint also retained causes of action for violation of the Cartwright Act, unfair competition, trade 
libel, intentional interference with contractual relations, and intentional infliction of emotional distress – albeit alleged only against 
defendants other than eBay."
1266,5," We say ""unfortunate"" because as this case illustrates, plaintiffs' wholesale incorporation by reference of each cause of action 
alleged in a complaint into each successive cause of action generally results in confusion. Here, eBay reasonably interprets 
plaintiffs' intentional interference cause of action to be based in part on eBay's suspension and termination of plaintiffs' account 
because those alleged acts are clearly set forth in the earlier paragraphs of plaintiffs' complaint and plaintiffs chose to 
incorporate all of those paragraphs by reference into their cause of action alleged against eBay. Plaintiffs, in turn, deny reliance 
on those facts in the apparent belief that only some of the allegations incorporated  [*11] by reference into their cause of action 
actually matter. eBay correctly interpreted the pleading, however, because the content of a complaint is determined by what's set 
forth on paper, rather than the plaintiff's subjective intent. That being said, it is plaintiffs' burden on appeal from a judgment 
following an order sustaining a demurrer to demonstrate why the allegations of their complaint are sufficient to state a cause of 
action. To satisfy that burden, plaintiffs may rely on only selected allegations."
1266,6," In their fifth amended complaint, plaintiffs allege this communication was sent to their customers. But the complaint 
incorporates by reference an exhibit reflecting the communication, which demonstrates it was included within a communication 
to plaintiffs. ""If facts appearing in the exhibits contradict those alleged, the facts in the exhibits take precedence."" (Holland v. 
Morse Diesel Internat., Inc. (2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 1443, 1447, 104 Cal. Rptr. 2d 239, citing Mead v. Sanwa Bank California 
(1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 561, 567-568, 71 Cal. Rptr. 2d 625.) In their opening brief, plaintiffs acknowledge  [*13] the 
communication was sent to them, rather than to customers. "
1269,7," Plaintiffs also point to a separate communication, which they alleged in their fifth amended complaint had been sent to their 
prospective customers, but admit in their brief was sent to them instead: ""'Do not respond to the sender [a prospective customer] 
if the message requests that you complete the transaction outside of eBay. This type of offer is against eBay policy, may be 
fraudulent, and is not covered by buyer protection programs.'"" While plaintiffs argue in their brief this communication 
""threaten[ed] and intimidate[ed]"" them; that it ""chilled"" their relationships with prospective customers because it caused them to 
fear ""that if they did complete a sale outside eBay such sale would be 'fraudulent'""; and that it ""falsely accus[ed]"" them of 
""'fraudulent' conduct,"" those assertions are both conclusory and inherently implausible. By its terms, the missive simply warns 
plaintiffs that a third party's offer may be fraudulent. It accuses them of nothing, and contains no threats."
1269,8," eBay contends plaintiffs' reliance on the Sherman Act to demonstrate independently wrongful conduct fails as a matter of law 
because the gravamen of the Sherman Act violation would be eBay's alleged interference with plaintiffs' business relationships. 
According to eBay, this allegation fails because ""[t]he conduct supporting [plaintiffs'] independent wrong theory is the same 
conduct constituting the alleged interference – namely, eBay's policy prohibiting members from using eBay to conduct business 
 [*25] outside of eBay."" (Italics added.) We disagree. The gravamen of a claim under section 2 of the Sherman Act is not the 
interference with business relationships; it's the abuse of monopoly power. (Mercy-Peninsula Ambulance Inc. v. San Mateo 
County (9th Cir. 1986) 791 F.2d 755, 759 [""The gravamen of a section 2 claim is the deliberate use of market power by a 
competitor to control price or exclude competition""].) A defendant's mere interference with plaintiff's business does not constitute 
a section 2 violation of the Sherman Act. The interference becomes wrongful only if defendant achieves it by improperly wielding 
its monopoly power. "
1274,1, The individual  [*2] Defendant named in Plaintiff's complaint as Shao Wei Hsu indicates that his true name is William Hsu Wu.
1274,2," Plaintiff asks the Court to take judicial notice of the Distribution Agreement. Docket No. 97. Because Defendants quote 
excerpts of this document in both their counter-complaint and their brief, Plaintiff's request for judicial notice is granted. "
1275,3," Plaintiff asks the Court to take judicial notice of the August 2012 e-mail. Docket No. 97. Because Defendants quote excerpts of 
this document in both their counter-complaint and their brief, Plaintiff's request for judicial notice is granted. "
1277,4," Plaintiff asserts that, although its motion arises under Rule 12(b)(6), dismissal  [*15] under the FTAIA ""would be equally 
appropriate under Rule 12(b)(1) [for lack of subject matter jurisdiction]."" Pl.'s Mot. 11 n.4. Defendants, however, contend that the 
""FTAIA does not implicate the Court's subject matter jurisdiction."" Opp. 7 n.3 (emphasis in original). The Court addressed this 
issue — which is relegated to footnotes in the parties' briefs — in In re Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) Antitrust Litig., 
2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 141968, 2010 WL 5477313, at *2-*3 (N.D. Cal.) (concluding that ""courts in this district continue to apply 
the [FTAIA] statute as jurisdictional""). "
1279,5," The McGlinchy court emphasized the importance of alleging an injury in the ""relevant market."" See 845 F.2d at 812 
(""Appellants . . . specifically identify the relevant market by alleging: 'For the purposes of the antitrust claims alleged herein, PB 
[a chemical product] is the relevant market for determining the anti-competitive effects of the defendant's actions.' Nowhere in 
their AFA complaint, however, do appellants allege injury to the competitive market for PB.""). "
1280,6," Defendants' suggestion that Plaintiff's California-based resellers and  [*27] distributors are harmed by Plaintiff's conduct is 
unpersuasive for the reasons articulated in the Sherman Act discussion: Defendants have failed to allege that these firms are 
competing in the relevant market. "
1285,1," The FTC's Complaint defined the relevant market as oxidates, their functional equivalents, and products derived from oxidates. 
 [*5] Plaintiff purchases unmodified oxidates, which is a segment of the broader market involved in the Commission's action."
1285,2," HHI is a measure of market concentration utilized by the FTC and the Antitrust Section of the Department of Justice to assist 
with the analysis of mergers. The Horizontal Merger Guidelines, which are published jointly by the two agencies and were 
revised in 2010, provide, for example, that ""[m]ergers resulting in highly concentrated markets [defined by an HHI of more than 
2500] that involve an increase in the HHI of more than 200 points will be presumed to be likely to enhance market power."" 
Horizontal Merger Guidelines, DEPT. 
OF JUSTICE & FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION, § 5.3 (2010), available at http://www.justice.gov/atr/public/guidelines/hmg-2010.html#5c. "
1287,3," As set forth in Midwestern Machinery, ""ITT is not useful to [Plaintiff] because it . . . did not concern a statute of limitations. In 
that case, ITT and the Federal Trade Commission had entered into a consent order for ITT's alleged violations of the Clayton 
Act[.] The order prohibited ITT from acquiring any other bakeries for ten years, and ITT violated that order. The case before the 
Supreme Court concerned the amount of damages ITT owed for violating that order."" Id. at 273 (internal citations omitted) 
(emphasis added). "
1288,4," The Court notes that it has added 40 days to the statute of limitations period to reflect the 40 days that the FTC proceeding was 
ongoing (February 26, 2009 to April 7, 2009). The addition of this 40 day period, however, is not enough to bring the May 18, 
2012 Complaint filing date within the four-year statute of limitations period that expired no later than four years and 40 days after 
the price increases in 2007. In other words, in a light most favorable to Plaintiff and assuming that the triggering price increases 
occurred in November 2007 (even though the first price increases were in March 2007), Plaintiff would have had to file the 
Complaint by approximately January 10, 2012 (i.e., over four months before Plaintiff filed the Complaint). "
1292,1," Where necessary, the court will distinguish the plaintiff entities. "
1294,2," Later in this case, on February 16, 2012, the court ruled that covenants not to compete executed by those employees who 
originally were employed by plaintiff Berbee (including Garcia and Dinkins) began to run for those who had been transferred 
within the CDW family of affiliated companies from Berbee to CDW Direct. (Dkt. 255). This meant that for many of the former 
Berbee/CDW  [*10] Direct employees who went to work for NETech in the Spring 2010, their non-competition obligations had 
already expired before they left for NETech. (See Dkt. 277, clarifying the court's summary judgment entry at Dkt. 255). "
1295,3," CDW stated in its December 17, 2010 motion that it had cause to believe that NETech had used CDW's confidential 
information to make a sale to Maui Jim. Former CDW/current NETech salesmen Doug Risk had worked on the Maui account at 
CDW for two years. When former CDW/current NETech  [*16] salesperson Ann Garcia won the account for NETech, CDW 
inferred that Doug Risk must have inappropriately shared CDW confidential information with Garcia for her use to win the 
account. (Dkt. 138). NETech's opposition to the motion contradicted CDW's inference. NETech presented evidence that Cisco, 
the manufacturer, and not NETech or CDW, landed the Maui Jim account. It was Cisco that gave Maui Jim a list of Cisco 
partners that Maui Jim could work with for installation and, from that list, Maui Jim chose NETech. (Dkt. 142 at p. 4). "
1298,4," Unlike this court, the Bowman court also let stand the law firm's abuse of process claim. 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7874, 2001 WL 
619381 at *10. "
1299,5," As discussed in the facts section of this Order, supra pp. 7-8, NETech did not support with admissible evidence its contention 
that CDW employees Andrew Short or Doug Bobo turned down a job offer from NETech or refused to speak to NETech because 
of any specific conduct by CDW. As to Mr. Short, his designated deposition testimony at best establishes that he received an 
email from CDW's CEO at about the same time he told NETech he decided not to join NETech's employ, but there is no 
evidence of the contents of the email. (See Short Deposition Transcript, Dkt. 295-1, at pp. 58-59.) NETech designated no 
admissible evidence with respect to Mr. Bobo."
1299,6," As explained in the February 2012 Order, Garcia and Dinkins originally were employed by, and their non-competition 
agreements had been entered with, a Wisconsin company—Berbee Wisconsin—that was later merged with a CDW entity. 
 [*32] After joining the CDW family, Garcia and Dinkins were assigned to work for CDW Direct, but their employment 
agreements with Berbee Wisconsin (which became CDW Berbee) were never assigned or otherwise transferred to CDW Direct 
and they never signed new agreements with CDW Direct. The court ruled that neither CDW Direct nor CDW LLC (the parent 
company) could enforce the agreements of CDW Berbee and that the employment assignment of Garcia and Dinkins to CDW 
Direct in July 2008 was an effective termination of their employment by CDW Berbee, triggering the running of their post-
employment non-competition periods. (Dkt. 255 at pp. 12-16). "
1300,7," NETech probably does not make this claim because Garcia and Dinkins previously told the court that they did not consider the 
contracts' restrictions enforceable, and they continued to work for NETech. (See February 2012 Order on summary judgment, 
Dkt. 255, at p. 5.) "
1301,8," Indiana's appellate courts are firm that defamatory statements about the competition—though NETech does not attempt to 
prove there were any—do not satisfy the illegal conduct element. Levee v. Beeching, 729 N.E.2d 215, 222-23 (Ind. Ct. App. 
2000))."
1301,9," NETech has also cited a CDW salesperson's statement that he wanted to win a deal for Maui Jim and was willing to provide 
some services ""for nothing"" in order to do that, but NETech does not base any claims against CDW on losing the Maui Jim 
business. "
1308,1," The factual recitation is derived generally from the Joneses' Complaint for Damages and Equitable Relief (""complaint""), the 
target of CMI's challenges, as well as  [*2] other matters which this Court may consider."
1308,2," This Court is unclear how the Joneses arrive at $2,651.19 in that $2,150.91 plus $500.58 equals $2,651.49. "
1310,3," ""We have extended the 'incorporation by reference' doctrine to situations in which the plaintiff's claim depends on the contents

1350,1," In the text of our opinion, we use spellings of these defendants' names that appear from their filings to be correct. In the caption

title of the district court action."
1350,*," The Honorable Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum, United States District Judge for the Southern District of New York, sitting by 
designation. "
1351,2," Gatt submitted the affidavit of Pietro Gattini as an attachment to its opposition to defendants' motions to dismiss. The affidavit 
largely mirrored the factual assertions presented in the amended complaint, but also contained additional allegations. The district 
court treated the affidavit as outside the pleadings and excluded it from consideration on the motions to dismiss. See Fed. R. 
Civ. P. 12(d). Gatt argues that the court erred by failing to consider the Gattini affidavit. We express no opinion about whether 
the district court should have considered the affidavit. Instead, we treat the allegations as if they had been included in a second 
amended complaint, and conclude for the reasons set forth in the text that even as so amplified,  [**4] Gatt has failed to state a 
claim upon which relief can be granted."
1351,3," Our references to ""PMC"" include, collectively, corporate defendants-appellees PMC Associates, Inc., PMC Associates, LLC, 
Philip M. Casciano Associates, Inc., and individual defendants-appellees Philip M. Casciano, Bryan Casciano, and Vesel 
Ramovic. Gatt alleges that Philip and Bryan Casciano are principals and senior officers of PMC and Vesel Ramovic is an 
employee of PMC."
1351,4," Although the record does not contain the entire Dealer Agreement, Vertex's October 22, 2007 notice of termination quotes 
language from the Dealer Agreement authorizing ""without cause"" termination by either party. Ex. 15 to Gattini Aff. Because the 
amended complaint refers to this termination letter, see Am. Compl. ¶ 139, we may consider the letter in reviewing the district 
court's dismissal of this action, see Rothman v. Gregor, 220 F.3d 81, 88 (2d Cir. 2000). The pertinent terms of the Dealer 
Agreement are undisputed: Gatt concedes that the Dealer Agreement authorized Vertex to terminate Gatt's  [**6] license at any 
time without cause. Appellant's Br. at 24, 45. "
1352,5," Although Gatt has alleged that defendants engaged in anticompetitive acts in connection with the sale of Vertex radios, it has 
not alleged that Vertex is the sole manufacturer of commercial land mobile radios. Thus, consumers were presumably free to 
purchase other brands of radios. As the district court recognized, this observation alone could be fatal to Gatt's claim if we were 
to reach the merits and apply a ""rule of reason"" analysis, because Gatt has failed to allege that competition was improperly 
restrained in the market for commercial land mobile radios generally. Gatt, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29072, 2011 WL 1044898, at 
*3. Because we conclude that Gatt lacks antitrust standing, however, we need not reach this issue. "
1353,6," Gatt maintains that after it disclosed its proposed quotation for the Police Department contract to PMC, PMC wrongfully used 
that information to underbid Gatt. The Police Department awarded the contract to PMC in March 2007."
1353,7," The court also held that Gatt lacked standing to pursue its RICO claims, a ruling that Gatt does not challenge on appeal. See 
Appellant's Br. at 4 n.1. "
1354,8," The ""rule of reason"" is the standard used to assess whether restraints on trade that are not unlawful per se nonetheless violate 
§ 1 of the Sherman Act. Leegin Creative Leather Prods., Inc. v. PSKS, Inc., 551 U.S. 877, 885-86, 127 S. Ct. 2705, 168 L. Ed. 
2d 623 (2007). When applying the rule of reason, courts weigh all of the circumstances surrounding the challenged acts to 
determine whether the alleged restraint is unreasonable, taking into account factors such as ""specific information about the 
relevant business,"" ""the restraint's history, nature, and effect,"" and ""[w]hether the businesses involved have market power."" Id. 
(internal quotation marks omitted). "
1355,9," The conditional phrasing of this step of the analysis hints at its difficulty. HN8[
] When assessing antitrust injury, we assume 
that the practice at issue is a violation of the antitrust laws, see Daniel, 428 F.3d at 437, and are, thus, in the difficult position of 
positing a rationale for the antitrust laws' prohibition of conduct that may, in fact, not be prohibited."
1355,10," We note preliminarily that Vertex is nowhere to be seen on the stage of this litigation other than through the cameo 
appearance of defendant Vineland. Vertex's absence as a defendant-despite its ostensibly key role in manipulating the bid-
rigging process-signals at least faintly that a purpose other than vindication of competition in an open market may be the true 
goal of this litigation. Even without assigning any substantive meaning to Vertex's absence, however, we easily find an absence 
of antitrust injury sufficient to permit Gatt to claim standing in this suit. "
1358,11," Varying formulations of the in pari delicto defense have been articulated and applied; which of them would be most 
appropriate in the antitrust context would bear careful examination. Cf. Bateman Eichler, 472 U.S. at 310-11 (declining to adopt 
wholesale in pari delicto rule in securities law context and holding that ""a private action for damages . . . may be barred on the 
grounds of the plaintiff's own culpability only where (1) as a direct result of his own actions, the plaintiff bears at least "
1359,," substantially equal responsibility for the violations  [**33] he seeks to redress, and (2) preclusion of suit would not significantly 
interfere with the effective enforcement of the securities laws and protection of the investing public"")."
1359,1," We are not compelled to determine whether Gatt has antitrust standing before addressing the doctrine of in pari delicto. 
Antitrust standing involves an analysis of prudential considerations aimed at ""avoid[ing] counter-productive use of antitrust laws 
in ways that could harm competition rather than protecting it."" Port Dock & Stone Corp. v. Oldcastle Ne., Inc., 507 F.3d 117, 121 
(2d Cir. 2007). In this vein, it is distinct from Article III standing, which must be assessed before reaching the in pari delicto 
defense. Cf. In re Senior Cottages of Am., LLC, 482 F.3d 997, 1002-03 (8th Cir. 2007);  [**36] see also Kirschner v. KPMG LLP, 
15 N.Y.3d 446, 459 n.3, 938 N.E.2d 941, 912 N.Y.S.2d 512 (2010). "
1360,2," I agree with the Majority that we may consider the Gattini  [**38] Affidavit. Generally, the harm to the plaintiff when a court 
considers material extraneous to a complaint without converting the claim into one for summary judgment is the lack of notice 
that the material may be considered. But ""[w]here plaintiff has actual notice of all the information . . . and has relied upon [the] 
documents in framing the complaint the necessity of translating a Rule 12(b)(6) motion into one under Rule 56 is largely 
dissipated."" Cortec Indus., Inc. v. Sum Holding L.P., 949 F.2d 42, 48 (2d Cir. 1991). Gatt relied on the Gattini affidavit in its briefs 
to the district court and on appeal, as well as during oral argument. The information and documents contained therein are known 
by Gatt and were employed by it in framing the complaint. There is no reason we should not consider it on appeal. "
1361,3," See Perma Life Mufflers, Inc., 392 U.S. at 146 (White, J., concurring) (""I would deny recovery where plaintiff and defendant 
bear substantially equal responsibility for injury resulting to one of [the co-conspirators] ....""); id. at 147 (Fortas, J., concurring) 
(Suit should be barred when ""the fault of the parties is reasonably within the same scale.""); id. at 149 (Marshall, J., concurring) 
(""I would hold that where a defendant in a private antitrust suit can show that the plaintiff actively participated in the formation 
and implementation of an illegal scheme, and is substantially equally at fault, the plaintiff should be barred from imposing liability 
on the defendant.""); id. at 153 (Harlan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (Stewart, J., joining) (""[P]roperly used[, in pari 
delicto] refers to a defense that should be permitted in antitrust cases."")."
1361,4," I fail to see how this is ""broad-brush application of the in pari delicto defense"" as the Majority seems to imply. Majority Opinion 
at 6148."
1361,5," As the Majority notes there are other potential plaintiffs (the state agencies that purchased equipment as a result of the bid 
rigging scheme) whose own interests would surely motivate them to vindicate the public interest in antitrust enforcement. 
Majority at 6145. "
1366,1," The court GRANTS Defendant BEMA's Request for Judicial Notice pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 201 because the 
California Secretary of State incorporation record for BEMA is a fact ""capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to 
sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned."" Fed. R. Evid. 201(b)(2). "
1369,2," Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 21, the court GRANTS Defendants' Request for Judicial Notice (Docket Item 
Number 16-1) as to Exhibits 2-4 and GRANTS Plaintiff's Request for Judicial Notice (Docket Item Number 29). "
1372,1," As used in this case, the western  [*4] United States refers to the geographic region west of the Rocky Mountains, which 
includes the states of California, Oregon, Washington, Nevada, Idaho, Montana, Arizona, Utah, Wyoming, Colorado, and New 
Mexico. "
1377,2, The motion was not decided on the merits. It was withdrawn to allow Plaintiff time for discovery. 
1378,3," The parties appear to be in accord that this case hinges on the strength of Plaintiff's circumstantial evidence and the inferences 
that can be drawn therefrom. (See Doc. 464 at 14-15; Doc. 482 at 4.) "
1379,4," There does appear to be a spot market, which could add yet another level of complexity to this matter. However, the record is 
entirely unclear regarding the level of U.S. Steel's participation in the spot market. Plaintiff alleges that spot market purchases "
1380,," represented an ""insignificant portion"" of all tin mill products sales, (see Doc. 267 at 4), and has identified only one such 
transaction in its opposition. (See Doc.482 at 11.) "
1382,5," The main body of the report is 82 pages long. (Doc. 490-8.) To the extent that Plaintiff is inviting the Court to mine the report for 
substantive opinions that are not cited in its briefing, the Court declines. See Carmen v. San Francisco Sch. Dist., 237 F.3d 
1026, 1031 (9th Cir. 2001) (district court is not expected to examine the file for evidence establishing genuine issue of fact where 
the evidence is not adequate referenced in its papers). "
1395,1, Georgia did not join the notice of appeal filed by the FTC and is no longer a party in the case. 
1396,2," In tension with the Court of Appeals' decision, other Circuits have held in analogous circumstances that substate governmental 
entities exercising general corporate powers were not entitled to state-action immunity. See Kay Elec. Cooperative v. Newkirk, 
647 F.3d 1039, 1043, 1045-1047 (CA10 2011); First Am. Title Co. v. Devaugh, 480 F.3d 438, 456-457 (CA6 2007); Surgical 
Care Center of Hammond, L. C. v. Hospital Serv. Dist. No. 1, 171 F.3d 231, 235-236 (CA5 1999) (en banc); Lancaster 
Community Hospital v. Antelope Valley Hospital Dist., 940 F.2d 397, 402-403 (CA9 1991)."
1396,3," After issuing its decision, the Court of Appeals dissolved the temporary injunction that it had granted pending appeal and the 
transaction closed. The case is not moot, however, because the District Court on remand could enjoin respondents from taking 
actions that would disturb the status quo and impede a final remedial decree. See Knox v. Service Employees, 567 U.S. 298, 
307, 132 S. Ct. 2277, 183 L. Ed. 2d 281, 295 (2012) ) (HN4[
] LEdHN[4][
] [4] “A case becomes moot only when it is 
impossible for a court to grant any effectual relief whatever to the prevailing party” (internal quotation marks omitted)); see also 
FTC v. Whole Foods Market, Inc., 548 F.3d 1028, 1033-1034 (CADC 2008) (opinion  [****16] of Brown, J.) (rejecting a 
mootness argument in a similar posture). "
1397,4," An amicus curiae contends that we should recognize and apply a “market participant” exception to state-action immunity 
because Georgia's hospital authorities engage in proprietary activities. Brief for National Federation of Independent Business 6-
24; see also Columbia v. Omni Outdoor Advertising, Inc., 499 U.S. 365, 374-375, 379, 111 S. Ct. 1344, 113 L. Ed. 2d 382 (1991) 
(leaving open the possibility of a market participant exception). Because this argument was not raised by the parties or passed 
on by the lower courts, we do not consider it. United Parcel Service, Inc. v. Mitchell, 451 U.S. 56, 60, n. 2, 101 S. Ct. 1559, 67 L. 
Ed. 2d 732 (1981)."
1397,5," The Eleventh Circuit has held that while Georgia's hospital authorities are “unique entities” that lie “somewhere between a local, 
general-purpose governing body (such as a city or county) and a corporation,” they qualify as “an instrumentality, agency, or 
'political subdivision' of Georgia for purposes of state action immunity.” Crosby v. Hospital Auth. of Valdosta & Lowndes Cty., 93 
F.3d 1515, 1524-1526 (1996). The FTC has not challenged that characterization of Georgia's hospital authorities, and we 
accordingly operate from the assumption that hospital authorities are akin to political subdivisions."
1397,6," Compare Ga. Code Ann. §§31-7-75(4), (7) (2012) (authorizing hospital authorities to acquire projects and enter lease 
agreements) with §14-2-302 (outlining general powers of private corporations in Georgia, which include the ability to acquire and "
1398,," lease property), §14-2-1101 (allowing corporate mergers), and §§14-2-1201, 14-2-1202 (allowing sales of corporate assets to 
other corporations). "
1399,7," See Southern Motor Carriers Rate Conference, Inc. v. United States, 471 U.S. 48, 64, 65, and n. 25, 105 S. Ct. 1721, 85 L. Ed. 
2d 36 (1985) (finding that a state commission's decision to encourage collective ratemaking by common carriers was entitled to 
state-action immunity where the legislature had left “[t]he details of the inherently anticompetitive rate-setting process . . . to the 
agency's discretion”); Hallie v. Eau Claire, 471 U.S. 34, 42, 105 S. Ct. 1713, 85 L. Ed. 2d 24 (1985) (describing New Motor 
Vehicle Bd. of Cal. v. Orrin W. Fox Co., 439 U.S. 96, 99 S. Ct. 403, 58 L. Ed. 2d 361 (1978), as a case where there was not an 
“express intent to displace the antitrust laws” but where the regulatory structure at issue restricting the establishment or 
relocation of automobile dealerships “inherently displaced unfettered business freedom” (internal quotation marks and brackets 
 [****27] omitted)). "
1400,8," The Court of Appeals also invoked Ga. Code Ann. §31-7-84, which provides that hospital authorities do not have the power to 
assess taxes, but allows the applicable governing body in the authority's area of operation to impose taxes to cover the 
authority's expenses. See 663 F.3d, at 1377. This provision applies in cases in which the county or municipality has entered into 
a contract with a hospital authority for the use of its facilities. See §§31-7-84(a), 31-7-85. No such contract exists in this case, 
and respondents have not relied on  [****32] this provision in briefing or argument before us."
1400,9," Georgia first adopted certificate of need legislation in 1978 in part to comply with a since-repealed federal law conditioning 
federal funding for a number of health care programs on a State's enactment of certificate of need laws. See 1978 Ga. Laws p. 
941, as amended, Ga. Code Ann. §31-6-40 et seq. (2012); see also National Health Planning and Resources Development Act 
of 1974, 88 Stat. 2246, repealed by §701(a), 100 Stat. 3799. Many other States also have certificate of need laws. See National

1443,3," BNSF adopts UP's arguments regarding the alleged deficiencies of plaintiffs' Section 1 claim, as stated by UP. BNSF Mot. 1, 7-

1443,4," UP also argues that plaintiffs have not alleged that they first paid fuel surcharges after the start of the alleged conspiracy; if 
they had paid surcharges previously, UP argues, plaintiffs could not have been injured by the conspiracy. See UP Mot. at 32. 
This presents a factual question to be adjudicated at a later stage of the litigation. The Court notes, however, that it has 
observed that ""the fuel surcharge programs applied before the class period were nothing like the widespread and uniform 
application of standardized fuel surcharges during the class period."" Rail Freight III, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 86288, 2012 WL 
2870207, at *47. "
1445,5," BNSF also asserts that its low market share (approximately 30%) precludes, as a matter of law, a finding that BNSF has or 
could obtain monopoly power, as required to find BNSF liable for monopolization or attempted monopolization. As plaintiffs now 
state that they do not bring monopolization or attempted monopolization claims against BNSF, the Court does not address this 
defense. A low market share does not preclude a conspiracy to monopolize claim, which plaintiff continues to assert against 
BNSF. "
1446,6," Although a few courts have suggested that two firms dominating the market can together constitute a monopoly, none of these 
courts has considered the issue directly. In JTC Petroleum Co. v. Piasa Motor Fuels, Inc., 190 F.3d 775, 779-80 (7th Cir. 1999), 
relied on heavily by plaintiffs at oral argument, the Seventh Circuit permitted a ""puzzling"" joint monopoly claim to proceed without 
engaging in any substantive analysis. In Movie 1 & 2 v. United Artists Commc'ns, Inc., 909 F.2d 1245, 1255-56 (9th Cir. 1990), 
also cited by plaintiffs, the Ninth Circuit permitted a monopoly claim to go forward where the defendant firm was accused of 
entering into an agreement allocating an entire submarket to that defendant,  [**22] thus allowing it to enjoy monopoly power 
within that submarket."
1446,7," The Court therefore does not consider whether price-fixing or market allocation are ""exclusionary acts,"" as required for 
monopolizing behavior. See United States v. Microsoft Corp., 253 F.3d at 58 (noting that a firm only violates Section 2 by 
acquiring or maintaining, or attempting to acquire or maintain, a monopoly through exclusionary conduct); cf. Fed. Trade 
Comm'n v. H.J. Heinz Co., 246 F.3d 708, 717 n.13, 345 U.S. App. D.C. 364 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (observing that price-fixing can 
encourage entry by firms currently not competing in the market); JTC Petroleum Co. v. Piasa Motor Fuels, Inc., 190 F.3d at 777

Supp. 315 (S.D.N.Y. 1996). Those cases addressed the assignment of accrued causes of action relating to a particular 
copyright. The standing issue here, on the other hand, concerns ownership of the copyright itself at the time this suit was filed. 
As discussed above, the SAC properly alleges that Goodness Films was assigned the Roscoe copyright on September 11, 
2012. Plaintiffs did not file this suit until October 10, 2012 and Goodness Films has alleged ongoing infringement by Defendants. 
SAC ¶¶ 77-80. This is sufficient to confer standing. As Magnuson [*22]  made clear, ""a prior oral grant that is confirmed by a 
later writing [may become] valid as of the time of the oral grant, even if the writing is subsequent to the initiation of litigation on 
the copyright infringement."" Magnuson, 85 F.3d 1424, 1428-29. To the extent Defendants argue that the September 11, 2012 
assignment did not convey to Goodness Films causes of action for alleged infringement that accrued prior to that date, 
Defendants have not met their burden of persuasion. Defendants are free to raise this argument in subsequent pleading but, as 
the Oracle court has pointed out, ""the weight of authority holds that a document executed subsequent to the transfer may 
effectively convey to the transferee the right to sue for infringements occurring prior to the transfer, even where the subsequent 
assignment of the right to sue was executed after the commencement of litigation by the transferee."" Oracle, 734 F. Supp. 2d at

1458,8," The SAC alleges that Plaintiffs sought to establish relationships with Weinberger as a potential script polisher, SAC ¶¶ 27, 40, 
and with Nunez as an actor and possible producer on the show, SAC ¶¶ 25-26."
1458,9, Plaintiffs did not address this argument in their briefing. Docket No. 74. 
1459,10," In its December 27, 2012 Order, this Court found that Plaintiffs properly alleged an ""extra element"" in their tortious interference 
claim such that it was not preempted by federal copyright law. The Court's prior order did not, however, address the sufficiency 
of the claims as a matter of state law—nor did it address the sufficiency of each claim under state law with respect to each 
Defendant. Docket No. 67 at 14. "
1460,11," Defendants argue that because Plaintiffs have alleged an implied contract with Weinberger and Nunez, they are limited to a 
remedy under the implied contract. Docket No. 71 at 19. Defendants' briefing on this point (limited to two sentences), however, 
does not satisfy the Court that the interference alleged in the SAC related solely to the implied-in-fact contract at issue. 
Defendants are free to address this issue more expansively in later proceedings. "
1461,12," Plaintiffs do not bring their unfair competition claims as ""consumers;"" this dispute is between competitors in the entertainment 
industry. While the California Supreme Court has not yet established a ""definitive test"" for ""unfairness"" in the context of 
consumer cases, none of the tests used by the California Courts of Appeal are relevant for the purposes of resolving this 
dispute. See Delacruz v. Cytosport, Inc., No. C 11-3532 (CW), 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 51094, at *24-25 (N.D. Cal. 2012) 
(acknowledging that Cal-Tech established the ""unfairness"" test for business competitor disputes). "
1463,1, Further unspecified statutory references are to the Civil Code. 
1464,2," Pantoja's original complaint referenced several federal statutes, including the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. § 1639), and the 
Home Equity Protection Act (15 U.S.C. 1602 et seq.). "
1467,3," Federal courts also follow Mabry's holding that section 2923.5 does not require an individualized declaration. (See Javaheri v. 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (C.D.Cal. 2011)     F.Supp.     [2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 62152].) "
1472,4, All further statutory references are to the Civil Code unless otherwise indicated.
1472,5," Sections 2923.5 and 2923.6 have been substantially modified by amendments effective January 1, 2013. (Stats. 2012, ch. 86, 
§ 4 & ch. 87, §§ 4, 7.) The claims in this case arise under the former versions of these statutes. All references to these two 
sections are to the former versions of these statutes before they were amended. (See Stats. 2009, ch. 43, §§ 1, 2.) "
1473,6," Section 2923.6 provided in pertinent part:  [*34] ""(a) The Legislature finds and declares that any duty servicers may have to 
maximize net present value under their pooling and servicing agreements is owed to all parties in a loan pool, or to all investors 
under a pooling and servicing agreement, not to any particular party in the loan pool or investor under a polling [sic] and 
servicing agreement, and that a servicer acts in the best interests of all parties to the loan pool or investors in the pooling and 
servicing agreement if it agrees to or implements a loan modification or workout plan for which both of the following apply: ""(1) The loan is in payment default, or payment default is reasonably foreseeable. ""(2) Anticipated recovery under the loan modification or workout plan exceeds the anticipated recovery through foreclosure on a 
net present value basis. ""(b) It is the intent of the Legislature that the mortgagee, beneficiary, or authorized agent offer the borrower a loan modification 
or workout plan if such a modification or plan is consistent with its contractual or other authority."""
1473,7," Decisions by the federal district court may be persuasive, though they are not binding on California appellate courts. (Johnson 
v. American Standard, Inc. (2008) 43 Cal.4th 56, 69, 74 Cal. Rptr. 3d 108, 179 P.3d 905;  [*35] cf. Gomes v. Countrywide Home 
Loans, Inc. (2011) 192 Cal.App.4th 1149, 1155, fn. 6, 121 Cal. Rptr. 3d 819.)"
1473,8," Section 2923.5 subdivision (c) described a special condition for creditors who filed a notice of default prior to enactment of the 
statute on July 8, 2008. This subdivision is inapplicable by its terms to the notice of default in this case which was filed on 
October 17, 2008. "
1481,1, This case involves many of the same counsel that represented the parties in Agnew. 
1483,2," The operative complaint acknowledges that this bylaw has been rescinded. [Dkt. 20 at 16 ¶ 50.] Because Mr. Rock seeks 
damages for actions taken before the bylaw was rescinded, its repeal does not render this case nonjusticiable. See Agnew, 683 
F.3d at 332 (""Since plaintiffs seek damages for prior actions taken by the NCAA and its member schools, the repeal of the 
multiyear scholarship prohibition does not render this case nonjusticiable.""). "
1484,3," The NCAA admits that Agnew found the rules at issue therein to be financial aid rules not entitled to a presumption of 
reasonableness, [dkt. 22 at 26], but still argues that the distinction made by the Seventh Circuit is not ""so clear cut[,]"" [id. at 27 
n.4]. Because it is bound by Seventh Circuit precedent holding that the one-year scholarship limit and the cap on scholarships 
are financial aid rules not entitled to a procompetitive presumption of reasonableness, the Court rejects the NCAA's argument 
that Plaintiffs had to allege facts rebutting that presumption. [Id. at 22-23, 25-27.] Even if the  [**13] Seventh Circuit's discussion 
on that issue were dicta, as the NCAA has argued, this Court is bound to follow informed, as opposed to casual, statements by 
that court as a considered expression of the issues before it. See United States v. Bloom, 149 F.3d 649, 652-53 (7th Cir. 1998) 
(""The question had been briefed by the parties, so the statement was informed rather than casual; it is a considered expression 
by the Court . . . . It would ill serve the interests of litigants and the judicial system as a whole to row against the tide of such 
statements."") (citations omitted). The Court will address the NCAA's argument regarding the proper characterization of the 
Division III prohibition on athletics-based scholarships separately, as that bylaw was not at issue in Agnew. [Id. at 23-25.] "
1486,4," The Court upholds the Division III bylaw prohibiting athletics-based financial aid as a matter of law in the next section. 
Accordingly, the Court will only analyze the market allegations as they relate to the Division I rules at issue. "
1487,5," Plaintiffs cite Todd v. Exxon Corporation to support their argument that the Court should only focus on the interchangeability of 
the buyers of labor (the NCAA institutions), not on the commonality and interchangeability of the sellers of labor (the student-
athletes). [Dkt.  [**25] 33 at 7 (citing 275 F.3d 191, 199 (2d Cir. 2001)).] The Court finds that focus too narrow, and has 
considered the interchangeability of both buyers and sellers, consistent with Marshfield Clinic. 65 F.3d at 1410. Moreover, Todd 
emphasizes that HN9[
] to survive a motion to dismiss, an alleged product market ""must bear a rational relation to the 
methodology courts prescribe to define a market for antitrust purposes—analysis of the interchangeability of use or the cross-
elasticity of demand""—and ""it must be plausible."" 275 F.3d at 200. Plaintiffs' proposed market fails, even in light of Todd. "
1488,6," The Court disagrees with the NCAA's assertion that professional sports are a plausible substitute for its member institutions 
because there has been no assertion that professional sports offer an opportunity for a participant to obtain education services, 
which is a key part of Plaintiffs' market allegations."
1488,7," The Court rejects the NCAA's invitation not to follow Agnew's ""discussion of a hypothetical labor market [as] dicta."" [Dkt. 22 at 
11 n.7] HN11[
] Just as the Seventh Circuit ""must follow decisions of the Supreme Court,"" this Court ""must follow decisions of 
[the Seventh Circuit]."" Reiser v. Residential Funding Corp., 380 F.3d 1027, 1029 (7th Cir. 2004); see also Bloom, 149 F.3d at 
652-53 (binding lower courts to follow considered expressions of superior courts). While the Court ultimately concludes that 
Plaintiffs have not pled a cognizable labor market, Agnew suggests that, at least in the context of Division I college football, it is 
possible to do so. "
1489,8," Although the Court need not conduct the applicable analysis at this stage in the proceedings, for purposes of context, HN13[
] 
the Rule of Reason tests whether a restraint merely regulates and perhaps thereby promotes competition or whether it may 
instead suppress or even destroy competition. American Needle, Inc. v. National Football League, 560 U.S. 183, 130 S. Ct. 
2201, 2216 n. 10, 176 L. Ed. 2d 947 (2010) (citation omitted). To analyze that question the Court must typically consider ""the 
facts peculiar to the business to which the restraint is applied; its condition before and after the restraint is imposed; the nature of 
the restraint and its effect, actual or probable."" Id. "
1490,9," In American Needle, the Supreme Court reaffirmed HN15[
] the application of the Rule of Reason to restraints on competition 
 [**35] that are essential if the product is to be available at all. 560 U.S. 183, 130 S. Ct. 2201, 176 L. Ed. 2d 947 (citing Board of 
Regents, 468 U.S. at 101). "
1491,10," For example, Plaintiffs allege that some Division III student-athletes, such as Mr. Steward and Mr. Collins, initially receive 
athletics-based financial aid and are later informed that they are in violation of the bylaw at issue."
1491,11," Even if Mr. Collins did have antitrust standing to challenge the Division III prohibition on athletics-based financial aid, his claim 
would fail for the same reasons as Mr. Steward's challenge. "
1496,1," The court notes that recent Supreme Court decisions have cast doubt on the entire essential facilities doctrine. Trinko, 540 U.S. 
at 411, 124 S. Ct. 872, 157 L. Ed. 2d 823 (""We have never recognized such a doctrine""). "
1500,2," Oklahoma does not recognize a separate claim for tortious interference that does not require a showing a bad faith. Tuffy's, 
Inc., 212 P.3d at 1165 (""The terms 'malicious interference,' 'intentional interference,' and 'tortious interference' with contract or 
business relations have been used interchangeably in Oklahoma jurisprudence, and do not designate distinct torts""). "
1526,1," Count II of plaintiff's second amended complaint collectively charges RFU, Scholl College and CMS with liability under the 
doctrine of respondeat superior, but the relationship between these parties is not delineated or explained in any of the pleadings 
or briefs filed by plaintiff and these particular defendants. See 735 ILCS 5/2-603(b) (West 2004) (""Each separate cause of action 
upon which a separate recovery might be had shall be stated in a separate count ***.""); Hartshorn v. State Farm Insurance Co., 
361 Ill. App. 3d 731, 735, 838 N.E.2d 211, 297 Ill. Dec. 724 (2005) (plaintiffs' complaint against an automobile insurer and a 
credit insurer was deficient by mixing the allegations against them together; the complaint should have stated the cause of action 
against each insurer in a separate count). Both plaintiff  [***56] and these defendants refer to RFU, Scholl College and CMS 
collectively as ""CMS."" Therefore, for disposition of this appeal, we will likewise treat RFU, Scholl College and CMS as one 
collective defendant. "
1541,1," Judge Pregerson also persuasively concluded that trademark claims similar to those asserted by Plaintiff here could not state a 
claim because gTLDs serve no source identifying function and are therefore not protectable as trademarks. See 2013 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 16896, [WL] at *7 (""The proposition that TLDs are not generally source indicators has been adopted by courts, legal "
1542,," scholars, and other authorities.""); 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16896, [WL] at *8 (""Because the purported mark .WEB used as a TLD 
is generic, IOD cannot obtain common law trademark protection and therefore cannot state a claim for infringement . . . .""). 
Although ICANN moved to dismiss Image Online Design's trademark claim, for an unexplained reason, ICANN specifically 
reserved moving on that ground in the present motion. "
1549,1," Each of the three classes excludes ""Defendants and their subsidiaries, parents, or affiliates, whether or not named as a 
Defendant in [the Amended] Complaint, federal government entities and instrumentalities of the federal government.""  [*16] (Id.). "
1551,2," As discussed in greater detail below, the Court finds that Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs' have pled sufficient facts to render these 
allegations plausible. "
1553,3, Defendants do not challenge the second element — an unreasonable restraint on trade. 
1557,4," For the purposes of this opinion, this market is referred to as the ""domestic DIPF market,"" and DIPF  [*46] produced in the 
domestic market is referred to as ""domestic DIPF."" "
1559,5," Defendants'  [*53] arguments concerning exclusive dealing policies appear under the heading ""McWane Did Not Possess 
Monopoly Power in the 'Domestic Fittings Market.'"" (Docket Entry No. 96, Attach. 1 at 32). Despite this heading, the Court 
interprets these arguments as a challenge to the second element of a monopolization claim. "
1562,*, The Clerk of the Court is directed to amend the caption as set forth above. 
1567,1, We use the past tense because the ARS market essentially collapsed in 2008. 
1568,2," A minority of ARS were preferred stock with a variable dividend yield. For simplicity, however, we  [**6] refer to the income 
stream flowing from a generic auction rate security as its ""interest rate."" "
1569,3," Given the substantively identical nature of the two complaints, citations are to the investor complaint alone."
1569,4," Plaintiffs assert that such coordination was possible because, ""[t]he auction rate securities market was highly concentrated, 
with regulatory and financial barriers that discouraged entry and the competition that entry could bring."" (Id. ¶ 62.) To support 
this claim, Plaintiffs offer market share numbers for ARS underwriting, showing that relatively few firms—all defendants here—
underwrote the majority of ARS offerings. (Id.) "
1570,5," Accordingly, we express no view of the district court's resolution of the Billing question, as it is unnecessary to our disposition. "
1571,6," As  [**18] our use of the broad term ""may include"" suggests, these plus factors are neither exhaustive nor exclusive, but rather 
illustrative of the type of circumstances which, when combined with parallel behavior, might permit a jury to infer the existence of 
an agreement. "
1572,7," Although they mention other actions taken by some or all of the defendants, for example placing support bids to prevent 
auction failures and ""fail[ing] to disclose and misrepresent[ing] the true nature of ARS to investors,"" Plaintiffs say these facts are 
merely included for context. Appellant's Br. at 7 n.3 "
1575,1," Because oral argument will not be of material assistance, the  [*3] Court orders this matter submitted on the briefs. E.D. Cal. 
Local Rule 230(g)."
1575,2," Unless specified otherwise, the facts in this section are from Plaintiff's SAC. (ECF No. 23.) "
1576,3," All further references to  [*9] ""Rule"" or ""Rules"" are to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. "
