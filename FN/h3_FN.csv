27,1," Rule 23(b) provides that a class ""may be maintained if Rule 23(a) is satisfied and if: . . . (3) the court finds that the questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting 
only individual members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating 
the controversy. The matters pertinent to these findings include: (A) the class members' interests in individually controlling the prosecution or defense of separate actions; (B) the extent and nature of any litigation concerning the controversy  [**8] already begun by or against class 
members; (C) the desirability or undesirability of concentrating the litigation of the claims in the particular forum; and (D) the likely difficulties in managing a class action."" "

arguments. We have considered all of the arguments even though we may not discuss them specifically. To the extent not 
addressed, we are not persuaded of their merit. "
30,3," The Central District of California has adopted  [**19] the State Bar Act, the Rules of Professional Conduct of the State Bar of 
California, and the decisions applicable to the Act and Rules. C.D. Cal. L.R. 83-3.1.2."
30,4," Congress has also expressed concern with the potential abuses of incentive awards. The Private Securities Litigation Reform 
Act of 1995 (PSLRA) prohibits granting incentive awards to class representatives in securities class actions. See 15 U.S.C. § 
78u-4(a)(2)(A)(vi). More recently, in the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 (CAFA), Congress made the following finding: ""Class 
members often receive little or no benefit from class actions, and are sometimes harmed, such as where . . . (B) unjustified 
awards are made to certain plaintiffs at the expense of other class members."" Pub. L. No. 109-2, § 2(a)(3), 119 Stat. 4. "
31,5," Objectors suggest that the ""clear sailing"" provision by which West and Kaplan agreed not to contest attorney's fees or incentive 
awards of no more than $ 25,000 evinces collusion. However, both payments were to be made from the settlement fund, capped 
at $ 49 million. This scenario does not signal the possibility of collusion because, by agreeing to a sum certain, West and Kaplan 
were acting consistently with their own interests in minimizing liability. Cf. Weinberger v. Great N. Nekoosa Corp., 925 F.2d 518, 
524 (1st Cir. 1991)  [**23] (inferring collusion from a ""clear sailing"" provision when the attorney's fees were to be paid on top of 
the settlement fund as this is counterintuitive defense behavior)."
31,6," No other adequacy-based ground for rejecting the settlement appears. Objectors suggest that an intra-class conflict exists 
based on speculation that the statute of limitations and tolling principles would allow only a subclass to pursue the section 7 
claim, but whether a subclass actually exists has not been adjudicated. The first amended complaint alleges the section 7 claim 
on behalf of the entire class, and the settlement provides compensation to the entire class for this claim. Thus, any potential 
conflict did not materialize and there is no cognizable prejudice. See generally Amchem Prods., 521 U.S. at 627. "

standards for admissibility of expert scientific testimony). "
36,10," To the extent one group of objectors claims this is misleading because class members lacked access to records that were 
sealed pursuant to a protective order, that group did not take advantage of access which was provided and sought to unseal 
those records more than three weeks after the deadline for filing objections. The district court denied that motion as untimely, 
which it had discretion to do. See United States v. W.R. Grace, 526 F.3d 499, 508-09 (9th Cir. 2008)  [**41] (en banc). "
39,1," Skalsky's brother, Charles Skalsky, also allegedly owns land in Prince George County near the proposed development site. 
(2d. Am. Compl. 1.) Dozier states that Charles Skalsky openly protested against the project in front of witnesses at the County 
Planning Commission meeting. (Id.)"
39,2," A major concern at the meeting was Plaintiff's development encroaching on the water rights of the CrossPointe Centre, a site in 
the same proximity as Plaintiff's property. (2d. Am. Compl. 1.)"
39,3, Denial of the zoning amendment application excluded the need to conduct a vote on the Special Exception application.
39,4," For clarity purposes, the counts have been construed from Plaintiff's general  [*5] allegations. "
41,5," Defendant argues that Plaintiff's Motion for Leave to Amend should be denied because (1) Plaintiff failed to attach the 
proposed Second Amended Complaint or a brief in support of the Motion, (2) the proposed  [*11] amendment would state an 
entirely new cause of action, (3) the proposed amendment subjects them to undue prejudice and delay, and (4) the proposed 
amendment demonstrates bad faith or an improper motive. (Def.'s Mem. Opp'n Pl.'s Mot. Leave File 3d Am. Compl. 2-4.) "
59,1," According to the Amended Complaint, Sand Lake Hospital is now known as Dr. P. Phillips Hospital. (Am. Compl. P 3). 
However, the parties refer to it by its former name, Sand Lake, and the Court will do so as well."
59,2," The State of Florida is named as a Defendant, and a Return of Service (Doc. 101) on the State of Florida has been filed. No 
appearance has been made on behalf of the State of Florida apart from the appearance of the state Attorney General (Doc. 94) 
on behalf of two other named Defendants, the Florida Department of Health and the Florida Board of Medicine. All counts in 
which the State of Florida is named as a Defendant are dismissed with prejudice by this Order, however."
59,3," Plaintiff's counsel has repeatedly tried to present this case as a complicated one. (See, e.g., Am. Compl. P 1 (referring to ""[t]his 
complex, multi-faceted lawsuit""); Hr'g Tr. 06/13/2005, Doc. 155, at 28 (""This is a medical peer review case. The law  [**5] is 
difficult. The facts are complex. And there are important policy issues that are interwoven in this whole case.""); id. at 32 (""We 
understand that these cases are complex ones . . . .""); id. at 44 (""[G]iven this very long peer review process, the very complex 
factual, the facts that interweave the defendants and their actions that created this ability for peer review to suspend him, it's a 
very complicated case.""); id. at 48 (""The intent was to tell the story to understand because it's a complicated story . . . ."")). While 
cases involving antitrust claims and allegations of unconstitutionality are often ""heavier"" than some of this Court's other fare, in 
working on the instant motions the Court has come to realize that this case has been made unnecessarily more complicated and 
time-consuming by the poor pleading of claims, the assertion of claims that are not viable on the facts alleged, and the confusing 
nature of some of counsel's arguments--not by the underlying nature of the case itself."
59,4," The Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this case under both 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal question) and 28 U.S.C. § 1332 
(diversity of citizenship). As noted in the text, Plaintiff brings  [**6] some claims ""arising under the Constitution [or] laws . . . of the 
United States,"" 28 U.S.C. § 1331, and there is complete diversity of citizenship because Plaintiff is a citizen of California and 
none of the Defendants is a citizen of that state. Plaintiff seeks well in excess of the $ 75,000 jurisdictional threshold for diversity 
cases."
59,5," 5These motions are: ORHS's Motion to Dismiss Counts 1, 3-10, and 17-19 (Doc. 107); Motion to Dismiss Counts 1, 3-8, 10-12, 
and 17-19, or for More Definite Statement, by Defendants Wolfram, Spiegel, Rief, Parks, Csencsitz, and Hillenmeyer (Doc. 108);

Evans, Galceran, Rivero, and Wolverine Anesthesia Consultants, M.D., P.A. (Doc. 109); Motion to Dismiss by Defendants 
Florida Department of Health and Florida Board of Medicine (Doc. 121); Motion to Dismiss Counts 1, 3-8, 10-12 and 17-19, or in

Florida Orthopedic Institute (Doc. 131); and Motion to Dismiss by Defendants United States of America, National 
 [**7] Practitioner Data Bank, Region IV of the Department of Health and Human Services, and Michael O. Leavitt (Doc. 142). 
Additionally, Defendant Bott has joined in the first three of these motions. (See Notice of Joinder, Doc. 124). "
60,6," The statements in the Background section are taken from the Amended Complaint (Doc. 3), HN1[
] the allegations of which 
must be taken as true at the motion-to-dismiss stage. Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 127 S. Ct. 2197, 2200, 167 L. Ed. 2d 
1081 (2007)."
60,7," The Amended Complaint does not specify the entity of which Defendant Diebel was the Chief of Staff. The original Complaint 
stated that ""at one point during the underlying peer review [Diebel] served as ORMC Chief of Staff."" (Doc. 1 P 16)."
60,8," Dr. John Connolly died prior to the filing of the Amended Complaint. The co-personal representatives of his estate, Gregory A. 
Rief and Linda G.T. Parks, have been named as Defendants in his stead, but in describing the allegations pertaining to Dr. 
Connolly the Court refers to ""Defendant Connolly."""
60,9," Dr. Phillip G. Spiegel--originally named as a Defendant herein--died on June 26, 2008. (See Suggestion of Death, Doc. 170). 
His estate, through its personal representative, Erik Lieberman, has been substituted as a Defendant. (See Docs. 179 & 180). In 
this Order, however, the Court refers to ""Defendant Spiegel"" when describing the allegations pertaining to him. "
61,10," As noted by Plaintiff, this hearing was commenced more than five years--indeed, nearly seven years--after the investigation of 
Plaintiff's practices began. (Am. Compl. P 109). "
62,11," The district judge in Tampa gave Plaintiff twenty days to amend the complaint. (See Order, Doc. 2). Nevertheless, Plaintiff filed 
the Amended Complaint in only three days. Plaintiff's counsel referred during oral argument to having been ""in a pretty tight time 
period"" with regard to amending the complaint because of ""statute of limitations situations."" (See Doc. 155 at 50). In light of the 
provisions of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(c), the Court does not readily discern the ""statute of limitations situations"" to 
which counsel was referring. The Court can only hope that had counsel spent closer to the twenty days allowed instead of only 
three refining the complaint, much time and effort by all parties and the Court could have been spared in dissecting the resulting 
document now at issue."
62,12," Plaintiff's wife, Joanne Werntz, has intervened in this case as an additional Plaintiff. (See Docs. 181 & 182). Her claims are not 
discussed in this Order."
62,13," Count II is brought against ORHS only, while Count XIII is brought against ORHS and all of the other nongovernmental 
Defendants. "
63,14," Defendants Spiegel and Diebel  [**20] are described as ""medical doctors,"" with no specialty given, (Am. Compl. PP 4 & 13); 
Defendants Murbach and Appelblatt are anesthesiologists, (id. PP 5-6); Defendants Bott, Csenscitz, Cole, Connolly, Evans, and 
Sanders are orthopedists, (id. PP 8-10, 14, & 18-19); Defendant Bone specializes in gastroenterology and palliative care, (id. P 
7); Defendant Moser is a pediatric otolaryngologist, (id. P 12); Defendant Galceran specializes in internal medicine, (id. P 15); 
Defendant Rivero is a radiologist, (id. P 16); Defendant Wolfram is a cardiologist, (id. P 17); and Defendant Hillenmeyer is the 
President and CEO of ORHS, (id. P 11)."
63,15," The full name of this business entity is not given in the Amended Complaint. In the initial Complaint, it is listed as Wolverine 
Anesthesia Consultants M.D., P.A. (Doc. 1)."
63,16," The spelling of this Defendant's name varies in the filings between Appleblatt and Appelblatt. The Court is unsure which is the 
correct spelling. "
64,17," Several of the other ""Peer Review Defendants"" are also mentioned by name only a few times; the description of the scant 
allegations against Appleblatt is merely an example of the Amended Complaint making only a few specific references to these 
Defendants individually."
64,18," There is a reference to ""placing Drs. Shea and Neder on the peer review hearing and appeals panels"" within Count IX. (Am. 
Compl. P 251). These doctors are not otherwise mentioned, however, nor is the membership on these panels otherwise 
 [**24] defined."
64,19, See note 18 supra.
64,20," While Plaintiff's counsel has professed to have attempted to shorten the Amended Complaint to comply with the Order of the 
first-assigned judge in the Tampa division dismissing the initial complaint as a shotgun pleading, many of the allegations of the 
Amended Complaint are superfluous and add nothing to the stating of the claims, especially given the lack of meaningful 
descriptions of the actors at issue. "

65,23," As one court recently explained: Allegations of antitrust violations are a fairly common thread in cases where physicians challenge privilege decisions made 
by peer review committees. Because those decisions are made by fellow physicians--and hence, in some cases, 
competitors in the same practice area--a suspended or excluded physician attempts to introduce evidence showing the 
privilege decision was made out of an impermissible desire to restrain trade or shut the physician out of practice, rather 
than out of concerns for patient care or the efficient functioning of a hospital. "
66,," Stratienko v. Chattanooga-Hamilton County Hosp. Auth., No. 1:07-CV-258, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21683, 2009 WL 736007, at 
*22 (E.D. Tenn. Mar. 17, 2009)."
66,24," 24 HN9[
] The federal antitrust laws provide for both private enforcement and government enforcement. See generally 54 Am. Jur. 2d Monopolies and Restraints of Trade § 306 (describing enforcement scheme and listing respective statutory 
sections). "
67,25," As noted in Nilavar, some courts have found that exclusive contracts in the medical arena can be pro-competitive and 
beneficial rather than running afoul of antitrust laws. See Nilavar, 142 F. Supp. 2d at 876 (citing Balaklaw v. Lovell, 14 F.3d 793, 
799 n.13 (2d Cir. 1994)). "
68,26," Moreover, although Plaintiff has used the term ""boycott"" in the Amended Complaint, (Doc. 3 P 161), the Eleventh Circuit has 
noted that its ""jurisprudence [and that] of the Supreme Court . . . cautions against the haphazard expansion of the 'group boycott 
label' and the concomitant imposition of per se  [**39] liability."" Retina Assocs. v. S. Baptist Hosp. of Fla., Inc., 105 F.3d 1376, 
1381 (11th Cir. 1997). "
69,27," Plaintiff alleges that Defendants conspired ""to exclude him from practicing medicine at ORHS facilities and in Central Florida."" 
(Am. Compl. P 161). Two paragraphs later, Plaintiff alleges that the Defendants' actions ""diminish competition in (1) the field of 
specialized emergency and trauma orthopedic surgery in the ORMC and Sand Lake markets, and/or (2) the field of healthcare 
services to be provided by The Physician Patient Alliance TM in the Central Florida market."" (Id. P 163). Plaintiff also refers to 
""the market for orthopedic services provided by ORHS at its facilities, including ORMC and Sand Lake and/or (2) . . . the market 
for healthcare services that the  [**41] Physician Patient Alliance TM would have provided."" (Id. P 175). A few paragraphs later 
he alleges restraint on competition ""in the provision of high quality, efficient, cost-effective (1) orthopedic medicine and/or (2) 
healthcare services that The Physician Patient Alliance TM would provide the public."" (Id. P 179)."
69,28," The Physician Patient Alliance is mentioned in background paragraphs 45, 46, and 149 of the Amended Complaint, as well as 
in several paragraphs within Count I. Paragraphs 45 and 46 provide:"
69,45," . Simultaneous with setting up private practice in Florida, [Plaintiff] began to implement plans for establishment of a 
physician-patient centered management services organization/independent provider association (""MSO/IPA"") called The 
Physician Patient Alliance. TM [Plaintiff] invested significant time, effort and expense in The Physician Patient Alliance, TM 
with the expectation that it would provide the best environment for physicians and the best healthcare alternative for 
patients."
69,46," . In the two []years before the onset of the peer review at issue in this Complaint, [Plaintiff] extensively marketed The 
Physician Patient Alliance TM to physicians throughout Central Florida - including physicians who practiced at ORHS, 
and/or were effectively employed  [**43] by ORHS, as well as those in senior leadership positions with ORHS. (Am. Compl. PP 45-46). Plaintiff later alleges that because of the peer review, ""[a]ll efforts expended in the development of The 
Physician Patient Alliance TM were lost. The entire project had to be abandoned once the peer review became known to 
[Plaintiff] in November 1996, due to the significant adverse financial effects of the peer review."" (Id. P 149). In Count I, Plaintiff alleges, with regard to The Physician Patient Alliance, TM that ORHS and the Peer Review Defendants 
engaged in an unlawful combination and conspiracy to ""intentionally destroy and derail [Plaintiff]'s development of The Physician 
Patient Alliance. TM"" (Id. P 161). He further alleges that these Defendants' acts ""diminish competition in . . . the field of 
healthcare services to be provided by The Physician Patient Alliance TM in the Central Florida market."" (Id. P 163). ""Further, the 
restraint of [Plaintiff]'s ability to make high quality services readily and fully available to the public through The Physician Patient 
Alliance TM is detrimental to the public need for such healthcare services."" (Id. P 165). Additionally, patients allegedly were 
 [**44] denied ""the opportunity to seek or benefit from [Plaintiff]'s services or from The Physician Patient Alliance. TM"" (Id. P 
166). ""[T]he summary suspension of [Plaintiff]'s privileges destroyed and derailed The Physician Patient Alliance. TM"" (Id. P 
173). Plaintiff has expended resources ""to overcome the illegal attempts by ORHS and the Peer Review Defendants to deny 
[Plaintiff] his right to develop and implement the Physician Patient Alliance. TM"" (Id. P 177). ""By eliminating [Plaintiff] and The 
Physician Patient Alliance TM as competitors, the boycott successfully reduced competition for ORHS and the Peer Review 
Defendants."" (Id. P 181)."
69,29," To the extent that Plaintiff is alleging that he was unable to follow through with his plans for completion of development of The 
Physician Patient Alliance, at best this could potentially be an aspect of his damages in an otherwise actionable claim, though it 
is difficult to imagine that Plaintiff could overcome the hurdle that damages must be more than speculative. "
70,30," (See, e.g., Am. Compl. P 175 (referring to ""the market for orthopedic services provided by ORHS at its facilities, including 
ORMC and Sand Lake""))."
70,31," Read literally, the Amended Complaint alleges that the Defendants""conspired to monopolize"" and ""conspired to attempt to 
monopolize."" (See Am. Compl. P 176). However, these assertions are equivalent--implicit within  [**49] ""conspiring to 
monopolize"" is conspiring to attempt to do so. In later filings, Plaintiff has argued conspiracy to monopolize and attempted 
monopolization. (See Doc. 134 at 11-13; Hr'g Tr., Doc. 155, at 46 (plaintiff's counsel asserting, ""I think that we've alleged "
71,," attempted monopolization and I think we've alleged conspiracy of monopoly."")). As noted in the text, Plaintiff's section 2 claim 
fails as a matter of law regardless of how it is characterized."
71,32," Defendant Sanders (Doc. 131) seeks dismissal on the basis that he did not take part in the peer review. He has attached an 
affidavit to this effect, but the Court cannot consider such affidavits in ruling on a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss without converting 
 [**52] the motion into a motion for summary judgment. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(d). The Court therefore excludes this affidavit 
from consideration. "
74,33," As noted by Defendants in their motions, a different type of factual allegations was presented in Greenberg v. Mount Sinai 
Medical Center of Greater Miami, Inc., 629 So. 2d 252 (Fla. 3d DCA 1993), where the court found an interference  [**61] claim 
sufficient pled. There, the doctor-plaintiffs alleged that the defendants influenced patients to see another doctor instead of them; 
offered inducements to other doctors to send patients to that other doctor; and told patients that the plaintiffs no longer practiced 
at the hospital. See id. at 255-56. Clearly, these allegations allege direct interference with relationships, whereas those in the 
Amended Complaint in the instant case do not."
74,34," HN26[
] ""The elements of a cause of action for the intentional infliction of emotional distress are: (1) the wrongdoer's conduct 
was intentional or reckless, i.e., he intended his behavior when he knew or should have known that emotional distress would 
likely result; (2) the conduct was outrageous, i.e., beyond all bounds of decency, atrocious[,] and utterly intolerable in a civilized 
community; (3) the conduct caused emotional distress; and (4) the emotional distress was severe.""  [**63] State Farm Mut. Auto. 
Ins. Co. v. Novotny, 657 So. 2d 1210, 1212 (Fla. 5th DCA 1995). Defendants challenge only the second element. "
75,35," As Plaintiff notes in his response memorandum, HN32[
] the elements of fraud are ""(1) a false statement concerning a 
specific material fact; (2) the maker's knowledge that the representation is false; (3) an intention that the representation induces 
another's reliance, and (4) consequent injury by the other party acting in reliance on the representation."" (Doc. 134 at 32 n.18 
(citing Ward v. Atl. Sec. Bank, 777 So. 2d 1144, 1146 (Fla. 3d DCA 2001))). If the fraud allegedly occurred in the process of the "
76,," peer review, it is unclear where the reliance by Plaintiff would inhere in such a claim. Plaintiff is, of course, free to attempt to 
plead his claim as chooses, so long as his pleading apprises the Defendants of the basis for it."
76,36," The federal Defendants--United States of America, National Practitioner Data Bank, Region IV of the Department of Health 
and Human Services, and Michael O. Leavitt--do not address Count XI in their motion to dismiss (Doc. 142)."
76,37," The Florida Department of Health and the Florida Board of Medicine also argue in their motion that they are not proper 
Defendants in this case because they enjoy the benefit of sovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment. Because all of 
the claims against these Defendants--Counts XI, XIV, XV, XVI, XVII, and XVIII--are dismissed in this Order for failure to state a 
claim, the Court need not address the sovereign immunity argument. "
77,38," As noted earlier, in Count II Plaintiff brings a breach of contract claim against ORHS based on failure to comply with the 
Bylaws. ORHS has not challenged that claim at this stage of the case."
77,39, (See Doc. 107 at 2 (acknowledging that Count 12 appropriately states a cause of action)).
77,40," In his response to the motion to dismiss this count, Plaintiff does not address the Peer Review Defendants' argument that they 
lack the power to rescind or expunge, instead arguing that these Defendants ""knew or should have known"" the  [**74] reports 
were false and that they made the reports. (See Doc. 138 at 18-19)."
77,41," Plaintiff also challenges the state statutes--sections 766.101, 766.1015, and 395.0193, Florida Statutes--that confer immunity 
in connection with medical peer review. The parties have addressed the federal and state statutes collectively in their pleadings 
and arguments, and the Court does so as well; in other words, the rulings regarding  [**76] HCQIA apply with equal force to the 
Florida statutory provisions."
77,42," These Congressional findings are that: HN36[
] (1) The increasing occurrence of medical malpractice and the need to improve the quality of medical care have 
become nationwide problems that warrant greater efforts than those that can be undertaken by any individual State. (2) There is a national need to restrict the ability of incompetent physicians to move from State to State without disclosure 
of the physician's previous damaging or incompetent performance. (3) This nationwide problem can be remedied through effective professional peer review. (4) The threat of private money damage liability under Federal laws, including treble damages liability under Federal 
antitrust law, unreasonably discourages physicians from participating in effective professional peer review. (5) There is an overriding national need to provide incentive and protection for physicians engaging in effective professional 
peer review."
77,42, U.S.C. § 11101. 
78,43," Additionally, HN37[
] ""no person (whether a witness or otherwise) providing information to a professional review body 
regarding the competence or professional conduct of a physician shall be held, by reason of having  [**77] provided such 
information, to be liable in damages under any law of the United States or of any State (or political subdivision thereof) unless 
such information is false and the person providing it knew that such information was false."" 42 U.S.C. § 11111(a)(2)."
78,44," HN40[
] The statute also directs the Secretary to ""by regulation, provide for--(1) disclosure of the information, upon request, to the physician or practitioner, and (2) procedures in the case of disputed accuracy of the information."" 42 U.S.C. § 11136. 
HCQIA further provides that HN41[
] ""[t]he Secretary . . . shall, upon request, provide information reported under this 
subchapter with respect to a physician or other licensed health care practitioner to State licensing boards, to hospitals, and to 
other health care entities (including health maintenance organizations) that have entered (or may be entering) into an 
employment or affiliation relationship with the physician  [**79] or practitioner or to which the physician or practitioner has 
applied for clinical privileges or appointment to the medical staff."" 42 U.S.C. § 11137(a). HN42[
] Reported information is 
declared to be considered confidential and its disclosure is limited; penalties are provided for violations of the confidentiality and 
nondisclosure provisions. 42 U.S.C. § 11137(b)(1)-(2). "
79,45," As noted earlier in this Order, Plaintiff's claim in Count XVI that HCQIA is not a valid exercise of Congress's power under the 
Commerce Clause has been abandoned."
79,46," Plaintiff does not identify which specific provisions of HCQIA he claims are unconstitutional, though there are many sections

80,49," The Freilich court further noted: [The plaintiff's] claim raises standing and ripeness concerns. Specifically, it is questionable whether [her] injury--the 
termination of her hospital privileges--is traceable to the provisions of the HCQIA, as [she] has not demonstrated how the 
HCQIA has been applied to her, if at all. Further, the HCQIA has yet to be applied to provide or deny immunity to the 
individuals against whom she has brought this case."
80,142," F. Supp. 2d at 692. At oral argument in the instant case, Plaintiff's counsel conceded that because the issue of entitlement 
to HCQIA immunity has not yet been determined in this case, ""it is possible to say that [Plaintiff] has not been harmed in terms of 
equal protection or due process by the federal statute."" (Hr'g Tr., Doc. 199, at 38). Counsel asked that the Court hold Counts XIV 
and XV in abeyance until the issue of immunity is determined. (Id.). However,  [**86] because the Court finds that these claims 
fail as a matter of law, there is no need to hold them in abeyance. "
81,50," Plaintiff's counsel asked that this claim, like the due process claim, be held in abeyance until the issue of immunity is 
determined. (See Doc. 199 at 38). However, the claim fails on the merits."
81,51," The Eleventh Circuit has held that private parties have standing to raise Tenth Amendment arguments, though concerns have 
been expressed in panel opinions about that precedent. See Seniors Civil Liberties Ass'n, Inc. v. Kemp, 965 F.2d 1030, 1034 n.6 
(11th Cir. 1992) (""Because this court has said before that, if injury or threatened injury exists, private parties have standing to 
assert Tenth Amendment challenges, Atlanta Gas Light Co. v. United States Dep't of Energy, 666 F.2d 1359, 1368 n.16 (11th

 [**91] have reservations about whether Atlanta Gas & Light Co. . . . and Seniors Civil Liberties Ass'n . . . were correct in saying

that ""absent the states of their officers, [the appellants] have no standing in this suit to raise any question under the [Tenth 
A]mendment,"" and other circuits have relied on this statement in holding that private parties lack standing. See Medeiros v. 
Vincent, 431 F.3d 25, 35 (1st Cir. 2005) (affirming holding that private parties lack standing, relying on TVA and noting that ""the 
Eleventh Circuit's [contrary] precedent commenced without any reference to TVA, and subsequent panels have expressed 
concern as to whether the omission has resulted in the perpetuation of a circuit precedent inconsistent with TVA.""); Oregon v. 
Legal Servs. Corp., 552 F.3d 965, 972 (9th Cir. 2009)  [**92] (""Only states have standing to pursue claims alleging violations of 
the Tenth Amendment by the federal government."") (citing TVA). But see Gillespie v. City of Indianapolis, 185 F.3d 693, 703 (7th 
Cir. 1999). In Pierce County v. Guillen, 537 U.S. 129, 148 n.10, 123 S. Ct. 720, 154 L. Ed. 2d 610 (2003), the Supreme Court 
noted that in light of resolution of case on a different basis, it ""need not address the second question on which [it] granted 
certiorari: whether private plaintiffs have standing to assert 'states' rights' under the Tenth Amendment where their States' 
legislative and executive branches expressly approve and accept the benefits and terms of the federal statute in question."""

115,6," In the motion, Bonadeo stated that he has not had sufficient time to respond to the motions because of: (i) the great complexity 
of the issue, (ii) the extensive nature of the Defendants' motions, (iii) his lack of  [*55] experience in prosecuting a case, and (iv) 
his limited access to the public law libraries and other legal resources during non-work hours. See Doc. 43 P 8 at 6."
115,7," On December 12, 2008, three days before his responses to the motions were due, Bonadeo filed Plaintiff's Motion for 
Imposition of Rule 11 Sanctions against Defendants O'Cheskey, Maloof Companies, New Mexico Alcohol Beverage Wholesalers 
Association and Southern Wine and Spirits. See Doc. 41."
115,8," The Court filed the notice of this hearing on April 2, 2009. Yet, in anticipation of the hearing, Bonadeo has still not filed any 
responses to the motions. "
116,9," Bonadeo in most instances fails to articulate to which Defendant he is referring. Only Lujan, Trujillo, Rodella and Park are 
representatives of the state. The other Defendants are private entities and individuals. "
117,10," Bonadeo asserts that he believed that Bonal supported his proposed legislation, but does not provide detail as to how he 
formed that belief nor indicate the materiality of such belief."
117,11," This factor in itself is not proveable, it already having been determined that there was no deprivation of rights. "
121,1, We note that no motion to consolidate has been filed. 
123,2," Because we conclude that plaintiff fails to state any claim against the Utility Defendants, we need not address the Utility 
Defendants' arguments that plaintiff's claims are also barred by the Corporation Commission's exclusive jurisdiction, the Filed 
Rate Doctrine, and by A.R.S. § 40-286. "
130,1," The Honorable Richard E. Dorr, United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri. "
131,2, It is unclear who wrote these notes and appellants have offered no record citation of their authentication.
131,3, Founder Childers had no recollection of Amway's involvement in negotiating the breakaway  [**7] from InterNET. 
134,4," Appellants stress the fact that the royalty fee and non-solicitation agreement were initially suggested by Zeoli in support of their 
assertion that Zeoli was acting as an agent for Amway. Zeoli's agency status is unclear. Although Zeoli had previously worked 
on Amway's behalf to resolve disputes and is listed as an Amway Steering Committee member on the unattributed Committee 
notes, it was Pro Net founder Childers who approached Zeoli for help in mediating the separation. We need not resolve this 
issue here, however, because Zeoli's proposal neither suggested nor precipitated unlawful activity attributable to Amway. "
135,5," Throughout their brief, appellants' proffered record citations lead us to their own motions filed before the district court. A review 
of these motions leads us often to exhibits filed  [**21] with the district court, but not included in the record on appeal. "
145,1," Another provision states ""HN2[
] [i]f a receiving bank has received more than one payment order of the sender or one or more 
payment orders and other items that are payable from the sender's account, the bank may charge the sender's account with "
146,," respect to the various orders and items in any sequence."" Cal. Com. Code § 11504(a). This provision does not change the 
analysis. Even assuming it allows a bank to post in any order, it does not change  [**12] the fact that the bank is subject to the 
duty of good faith and fair dealing."
146,2," The UCC drafters excluded transactions initiated by means of a credit card or similar device. When discussing what 
transactions are covered by the Electronic Fund Transfer Act of 1978, 15 U.S.C. 1693 et seq., a UCC drafter stated: They are a variety of transactions -- point of sale transactions, for example, where you put a debit card in a terminal at the 
grocery store and you get an instant debit to your checking account at the bank. It covers transactions in automated teller 
machines. . . ."
146,*," * * They are a variety of transactions which are described in that act. They're  [**13] all consumer transactions. We have 
simply taken the position that in anything that is covered by federal law, we are preempted anyway, and we simply say: If 
it's covered in that act, then it is simply not covered here. Transcript of Proceedings, National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, UCC Arts. 3, 4, & 4A, at 141:16-

million from ""sort order/processing changes"" (Opp. Exh. 7) "
147,4," Unless otherwise indicated, internal citations and quotations are omitted from all quoted authorities. "
148,5," This order recognizes that California law separately recognizes a tort of breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, 
which has been generally confined to insurance cases. See Freeman & Mills v. Belcher Oil Co., 11 Cal. 4th 85, 102, 44 Cal. 
Rptr. 2d 420, 900 P.2d 669 (1995). The immediate case does not involve a tort claim but rather a contract claim, with the main 
difference being that punitive damages are not available for a contract claim. Other decisions in this district also have held that 
the unfair prong of Section 17200 extends to claims of breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. See, e.g., Gabana 
Gulf Distrib., Ltd. v. Gap Int'l Sales, Inc., 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1658, *28 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 9, 2008); In re HP Inkjet Printer Litig., 
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12848, *21 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 7, 2006). "
157,1," With greater perspective, the Court would have granted the Motion to Dismiss. This Summary Judgment contains nearly the 
same analysis. "
160,2," Defendants argument that the ETF is an alternative performance provision is further supported by the fact that the churn rate 
statistics for Defendants' consumers show that largest churn in consumers is during the first three months of service. 
(Armbruster Depo. at 127:22-128:2; 135:11-20.) This makes sense because it is during the first three months when the ETF is 
the most cost effective way of performing the contract."
160,3," Plaintiffs point out that before 2005, Defendants had a policy of charging the ETF to customers who were terminated for cause 
as well as those who voluntarily terminated the Agreement. Plaintiffs, however, do not claim to have terminated their contract 
while that policy was in effect. "
165,1," Plaintiffs are part of the same parent corporation -- RDK Truck Sales and Services focuses upon sales to private businesses, 
while RDK Municipal sells to local governments and municipalities. "
167,2," Ready trucks, as the name suggests, are completed garbage trucks that can be driven off the lot and used immediately. Ready 
trucks are well-suited for those who do not have any special requirements or do not desire to wait for a truck."
167,3," Commentators have noted that Poller's language has ""a limited context"" and in ""retrospect it is hard to extract a serious 
antitrust issue from the Poller case."" Phillip E. Areeda, Herbert Hovenkamp, & Roger G. Blair; ANTITRUST LAW § 308 (2d. ed. 
2008.) "
168,4," Section 1 of the Sherman Act provides that: [e]very contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the 
several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal. Every person who shall make any contract or engage in any 
combination or conspiracy declared by sections 1 to 7 of this  [*12] title to be illegal shall be deemed guilty of a felony, and, 
on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding $ 100 million if a corporation, or, if any other person, $ 1 
million, or by imprisonment not exceeding 10 years, or by both said punishments, in the discretion of the court."
168,15, U.S.C. § 1.
168,5," A conspiracy is horizontal ""when a number of competitor firms agree with each other and at least one of their common 
suppliers or manufacturers to eliminate their price-cutting competition by cutting his access to supplies."" Rossi v. Standard 
Roofing, Inc., 156 F.3d 452, 465 (3d Cir. 1998). "
169,6," It is important to place these sales numbers in context as RDK notes that it ""was one of Mack's [b]iggest [c]ustomers."" (Pls.' 
Resp. Mot. Summ. J. 11.) From 1998-2002, Mack's fifty biggest customers combined purchased 48,082 Mack trucks. Ryder was 
Mack's largest customer buying 9,810 trucks, and Waste Management was second buying 6,078 trucks. Mack's twenty-five 
largest customers bought 40,915 trucks, and the next twenty-five  [*17] largest dealers bought a customer total of 7,167 trucks. 
RDK purchased 265 Mack trucks, or .55%, of all Mack chassis sold during this time. (Pls.' Resp. to Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 26, Top 
Mack Retail Sales 1998- 2002.)"
169,7," RDK repeatedly notes that Mack denied sales assistance to RDK. Technically, while the effect is much the same, this 
statement is factually incorrect. Mack does not provide sales assistance to customers. Sales assistance is pricing offered 
assistance to Mack dealers, which is passed on, in the form of a reduced price, to customers, such as RDK. "
170,8," RDK cites the following manufacturer-dealer cases to support its argument against Mack and the Mack Dealers: Alvord-Polk, 
Inc. v. F. Schumacher, 37 F.3d 996 (3d Cir. 1994); Big Apple BMW, Inc. v. BMW of North America, Inc., 974 F.2d 1358 (3d Cir. 
1992); and  [*20] Arnold Pontiac-GMC, Inc. v. General Motors Corp., 786 F.2d 564 (3d Cir. 1986). These manufacturer-dealer cases involved the Third Circuit's reversal of district court decisions granting summary judgment to 
the manufacturer. RDK, in citing them, distinguishes them from a ""facially distinguishable"" case, cited by Defendants, as it 
involved a buyers' co-operative. (Pls.' Sur-Reply Br. 8, n.3 (citing NW Wholesale Stationers, Inc. v. Pac. Stationery and Printing 
Co., 472 U.S. 284, 105 S. Ct. 2613, 86 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1985).) This Court finds these manufacturer-dealer cases facially 
distinguishable from the present matter. By way of summary, in Arnold Pontiac-GMC, appellant asserted that its efforts to 
acquire a Buick franchise were frustrated by the opposition of local Buick dealers. Similarly Big Apple BMW, involved a suit by 
an automobile dealer who had entered into negotiations with BMW to buy three BMW franchises. The sale fell through, and 
appellant filed suit alleging that BMW's reasons for refusing to sell the dealerships were pretextual and that dealer complaints 
were the real reason why the offer was rescinded. Finally, Alvord-Polk, Inc., involved a suit brought by wallpaper dealers selling 
wallpaper over the phone.  [*21] These ""phone sales"" dealers alleged that ""bricks and mortar"" dealers, belonging to the same 
wallpaper dealer's association, conspired to force wallpaper manufacturers to cease dealing with the phone dealers. Factually, Big Apple BMW and Arnold Pontiac-GMC are distinguishable from the present case as both involved dealer efforts to 
bar individuals from joining their dealer network. By way of comparison, RDK has never sought to become a Mack dealer. In 
fact, it has specifically avoided becoming an authorized dealer of any truck brand. Alvord-Polk, is distinguishable too as it 
involved a dispute by dealers, who were part of the same trade association, and were marketing the same product. Here, RDK is 
neither part of the Mack dealer network, nor is it marketing the exact same product, both--technically as RDK labels all its trucks 
as ""used""--and literally--as RDK only provides ready trucks and not the custom chassis sold by Mack dealers. As a legal matter, while all three of these cases are good law, this Court believes that their holdings must be analyzed in light of 
the Supreme Court's recent decision in Leegin analyzing the quantum of evidence needed in manufacturer-dealer cases, which 
 [*22] this Court addresses in the body of its analysis."
170,9," To comply with Florida law, RDK technically does not sell new trucks, reclassifying these unused trucks it buys as ""used."" 
(Defs.' Mot. Summ. J., Ex. 19, Scott Dep. 26:15-27:22.)"
170,10," When analyzing restraints among vendors, the Supreme Court in Leegin noted that some restraints on intrabrand competition 
were permissible to the extent that these restraints promoted interbrand competition. See Leegin, 127 S. Ct. at 2708. Leegin is 
instructive since RDK, unlike authorized dealers, plays no role in Mack's ability to compete with other brands. "
171,11," Underscoring the value of dealer investments, RDK's Municipal Sales Manager, David Lance, at his deposition, was asked if 
RDK's competitors, who were not authorized EZ-Pack Dealers, should receive the same pricing from EZ-Pack as does RDK, an 
authorized dealer. Mr. Lance was asked, based on his understanding of the term ""fair,"" if he believed ""it  [*27] would be fair for 
E-Z Pack to give the same price to Trucks and Parts for Tampa [not an authorized dealer] for their equipment they give to RDK?"" 
He responded, ""I don't think it would be fair because of our investments."" (Defs.' Reply Br., Ex. 5, David Lance Dep. 78:5-15, Jul. 
11, 2007.) "
175,12," RDK tacitly acknowledges that the Favia Deposition is not direct evidence. RDK's Sur-Reply asserts only that ""[t]he testimony 
of Mack Executive, Kevin Flaherty, is direct evidence of a three-way agreement."" (Pls.' Sur-Reply 1.) By exclusion, it admits that 
Mr. Favia's statement fail as direct evidence. "
177,13," Defendants analyze RDK's ""evidence"" that McNeilus's price increase was part of conspiracy with Heil by noting that when 
McNeilus told RDK that it was increasing its price, no mention was made of Heil. Defendants' analysis provides an instructive 
example as to this Court's proper posture toward evidence at the summary judgment stage. Defendants claim that RDK makes 
an impermissible logical leap when it suggests that McNeilus's comments to RDK constitute evidence of a conspiracy involving 
Heil. Defendants are correct. But Defendants make a similarly fallacious leap when they interpret this same statement as 
evidence ruling out Heil's participation in a conspiracy with McNeilus. By cabining the possible interpretations of ambiguous 
evidence, Plaintiff and Defendants seek to have this Court make credibility determinations regarding factual disputes. At 
summary judgment, it is not the court's role to weigh disputed evidence and decide which is more probative, or to make 
credibility determinations. Boyle v. County of Allegheny, Pa., 139 F.3d 386, 393 (3d Cir. 1998) (citing Petruzzi's IGA, 998 F.2d at 
1230.)) "
180,14," This latter argument, while unclear, seems to suggest that had RDK possessed ""established Mack accounts"" it would not have 
objected to the Body Builder's antitrust behavior because it would have profited RDK."
180,15," RDK also asserted claims for relief under Florida's Antitrust Act (FLA. STAT. § 542.15 et seq.) (Id. PP 71-77). Florida's 
Antitrust Act mirrors the Sherman Act. Accordingly, the claims brought under this Act are dismissed along with the three "
181,," Sherman Act claims. See All Care Nursing Serv. v. High Tech Staffing Servs., 135 F.3d 740, 746 (11th Cir. 1998)  [*62] (""It is the 
intent of the Legislature that, in construing this chapter, due consideration and great weight be given to the interpretations of the 
federal courts relating to comparable federal antitrust statutes.""); see also St. Petersburg Yacht Charters, Inc. v. Morgan Yacht, 
Inc., 457 So.2d 1028, 1032 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1984) (""The Florida legislature has, in effect, adopted as the law of Florida the 
body of antitrust law developed by the federal courts under the Sherman Act."")."
181,16," Neither Plaintiff nor Defendants oppose Plaintiff's application of Florida law. As such, this Court will analyze the these claims 
based upon Florida law."
181,17," Fla. Stat. 501.211(2) provides: In any action brought by a person who has suffered a loss as a result of a violation of this part, such person may recover 
actual damages, plus attorney's fees and court costs as provided in s. 501.2105. However, damages, fees, or costs are not 
recoverable under this section against a retailer who has, in good faith, engaged in the dissemination of claims of a 
manufacturer or wholesaler without actual knowledge that it violated this part. "
182,18," The plain text of the Sherman Act is broad barring ""every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, 
in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States . . . is declared to be illegal."" 15 U.S.C. § 1 (2004). Yet courts have 
not read the statute literally finding that the Act only prohibits contracts, combinations, or conspiracies that unreasonably restrain 
trade. Bus. Elec. Corp. v. Sharp Elec. Corp., 485 U.S. 717, 723, 108 S. Ct. 1515, 99 L. Ed. 2d 808 (1988). Florida's Unfair 
Practices Act is similarly broad encompassing ""unfair or deceptive acts or practices committed in the conduct of any trade or 
commerce,"" but it has not been limited in the manner that the Sherman Act has been and, in fact, it has been held to cover 
actions not listed in the statute. See Mack v. Bristol-Myers Squibb, Co., 673 So.2d at 104."
182,19," This Court dismisses any Unfair Practices claim as it applies to RDK's vertical conspiracy claims. (See Third Am. Compl. PP 
77-80.) RDK  [*69] has failed to show that Mack's decision to deny dealers sales assistance, when selling to RDK, was anything 
more than a permissible, unilateral decision by Mack. Given Mack's ability to make such unilateral pricing decisions coupled with 
RDK's failure to show a consensus among Mack's dealers, with regard to RDK, it is clear that RDK cannot show that Mack 
engaged in a deceptive. See Dunn, 193 F.3d at 1191."
182,20," This Court finds that RDK has no grounds for any Unfair Practices claims against Mack regarding RDK's claims of an antitrust 
conspiracy between Mack and its dealers."
182,21, This Court does not address RDK's claim for injunctive relief since Defendants' do not dispute the availability of such relief. 
183,22," Counts four and five both assert claims for ""Tortious Interference with Existing and Prospective Business Relations."" (Third 
Am. Compl. PP 81-92) Count four names Mack, McNeilus, and Heil. Count five only names Mack. (Id. at PP 81-86.) These 
claims are redundant and as such will be considered  [*72] as one claim. (Id. at PP 87-92.)"
183,23, (Third Am. Compl. PP 82-86.)
183,24, (Third Am. Compl. PP 87-92.) 
184,25," This Court dismisses any tortious interference claim as it applies to RDK's vertical conspiracy claims. RDK has failed to show 
that Mack's decision to deny dealers sales assistance, when selling to RDK, was anything more than a permissible, unilateral 
decision. Given Mack's ability to make unilateral pricing decisions as well as RDK's failure to show that Mack's dealers agreed 
among themselves that Mack should deny sales assistance on sales to third party dealers. RDK cannot show that Mack 
intentionally and unjustifiably interfered with RDK's relationship with Mack dealers much less that RDK suffered an injury 
resulting from such interference. See Dunn, 193 F.3d at 1191. "
186,26," The Molder Report is found at: (1) Mack's Resp. Mot. Summ. J., Ex. 12; and (2) Pls.' Mot. Summ. J., Ex. 4."
186,27, RDK is  [*83] an authorized EZ Pack dealer. 
188,28," Mack claims that ""FET"" refers to ""federal excise tax."" (Id. at 41.) "
192,29," RDK posits two theories as to why Mack has suffered non-existent and speculative damages. (Pls.' Mot. Summ. J. 32-35.) 
Both theories are without basis. First, RDK asserts that ""Mack wrongly assumes, without any evidentiary basis, that the Mack 
dealers would have purchased every truck at issue from Mack without ESA."" (Pls.' Mot. Summ. J. 33.) Second, ""Mack also 
assumes, again without any evidentiary basis, that RDK or some other third party would have purchased the same trucks from 
the Mack dealers at any price at which the Mack dealers offered the trucks, even  [*103] if the Mack dealers received no ESA 
from Mack."" (Id.) Without belaboring the point, RDK's argument lacks foundation as it appears to be asserting that but for RDK's 
alleged fraudulent purchases, Mack might not have sold any of these chassis and, as a result, damages cannot be determined. 
In essence, RDK asserts that the alleged fraud actually helped Mack sell trucks that it otherwise might not have sold. Without 
addressing the merits, or demerits of this argument, this Court will note that Mack, by tallying the alleged fraudulent sales 
assistance, has provided sufficient evidence of damages to withstand summary judgment. Further, RDK notes that Mack ""took 
absolutely no steps to mitigate its alleged losses."" (Id. at 34.) Mack, as master of its Counterclaim, may pursue damages from 
the liable party of its choosing. Mack could have sought to join Dallas Mack, Worldwide, or Nextran. It was within Mack's right to 
decide not to do so. Should Mack's claim prevail, RDK may seek indemnification from its alleged co-conspirators."
192,30," RDK notes that ""Dogs Gone Wild"" was a Mack promotional campaign, and suggests that a distinction between sales made 
during and after this promotional was made so that Mack can claim ""additional damages relating to the extra  [*105] incentives 
provided under the Dogs Gone Wile program."" (Id. at 11 n.12.) "

201,1," This motion is filed on behalf of the following defendants: The First American Corporation (""First American""), First American 
Title Insurance Company, United General Title Insurance Company, Fidelity  [*6] National Financial, Inc. (""Fidelity National""), 
Fidelity National Title Insurance Company, Ticor Title Insurance Company, Ticor Title Insurance Company of Florida, Chicago 
Title Insurance Company, Security Union Title Insurance Company, Commonwealth Land Title Insurance Company, Lawyers 
Title Insurance Corporation, Transnation Title Insurance Co., Stewart Title Guaranty Company, Stewart Title Insurance 
Company, Old Republic National Title Insurance Company, and National Title Insurance of New York, Inc. In its separate motion 
to dismiss, Old Republic International Corporation (""ORI"") states that it incorporates by reference the arguments raised in the 
Defendants' joint motion. (See ORI's Mot. at 1 n.1.) Although ORI has moved separately, the Court's analysis herein applies 
equally to ORI. The Court notes that ORI has not complied with Local Rule 3-4(c)(2), which requires all footnotes to be in 12 point font. 
The Court hereby places all parties on notice that if the parties fail to comply with this requirement in future filings, the 
Court shall strike their papers from the record."
201,2," According to Plaintiffs, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and the California Commissioner of Insurance 
investigated Defendants because of these practices, imposed fines in some instances, and found that Defendants' actions 
violated certain provisions of federal and state law. (Id. PP 9-11, 147-180.) "
204,3," Indeed, in their opposition brief, Plaintiffs acknowledge that one must infer the existence of an agreement to fix prices in 
California. (Opp. Br. at 8:17.)"
204,4," See Docket No. 123, Defendants' Statement of Recent Decision, Ex. A. "
205,5," Plaintiffs allege that title insurance premium rates in California range from above $ 1500 to just above $ 1700, and that those 
rates have held steady since approximately 1998. (Am. Compl. P 196.) Plaintiffs have not, however,  [*23] set forth any facts to 
compare rates in California with rates in other states, including states with rate setting organizations. It appears, however, that 
title insurance rates across the country are far from uniform. See, e.g., Classic Homes, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 78569 at *15 
(noting average price for Arkansas premium is $ 1,150). "
206,6," The Cartwright Act claim is based on the same allegations as the Sherman Act claim. ""[A]nalysis under California's antitrust 
law mirrors the analysis under federal law[.]"" County of Tuolumne v. Sonora Community Hosp., 236 F.3d 1148, 1160 (9th Cir. 
2001); see also In re Late Fee, 528 F. Supp. 2d at 965. For the reasons set forth herein, the Cartwright Act claim also is 
dismissed, with leave to amend."
206,7," Plaintiffs do not allege and do not argue that the Parent Corporations are liable under an alter-ego theory. (See generally Am. 
Compl. PP 29-45, 59-62, 65-68; Opp. Br. at 18:7-19:20, 24:23-25:15.) "
207,8," In light of the Court's determination that Plaintiffs have not alleged facts sufficient to state a claim under the UCL, the Court 
does not reach Defendants' alternative argument that the UCL claim is barred by the Insurance Code. If Defendants choose to 
renew this argument in connection with a subsequent motion to dismiss or a motion for judgment on the pleadings, the Court 
requests that the parties devote greater attention to this issue than they did in the motions to dismiss. "
213,1," DeBartolo's company, DeBartolo Entertainment Louisiana Gaming, Inc., also remains a defendant."
213,2," Defendants Hollywood Park, Inc., Robert List, Louisiana Gaming Enterprises, Inc., Boomtown, Inc., and Louisiana-I Gaming, 
L.P., were dismissed without prejudice on March 5, 1999. Defendants Boyd Gaming Corporation, Boyd Louisiana, LLC, Boyd 
Kenner, Inc., and Treasure Chest Casino, LLC were dismissed with prejudice on October 21, 2003. Defendant, Hollywood 
Casino Corporation, was dismissed with prejudice on June 18, 2004. "
214,3," This Act was superceded in part in 1996 by the Louisiana Gaming Control Law, La. R.S. 27:1, et seq. The portions of the prior 
law that were not revoked are found at La. R.S. 27:41 et seq."
214,4," This structure was revoked by the Louisiana Gaming Control Law, La. R.S. 27:1, et seq.  [**5] The Gaming Control Law 
created the Louisiana Gaming Control Board, which inherited the powers of both the Gaming Commission and Enforcement 
Division. However, the two-body structure was still in place at all relevant times in this case."
214,5," This rule was apparently struck down in State Through Louisiana Riverboat Gaming Commission v. Louisiana State Police 
Riverboat Gaming Enforcement Division, 95-2355 (La. App. 1 Cir. 8/21/96), 694 So.2d 316. The court essentially found 
Commission exceeded its authority by implementing the rule, which gave the Commission licensing power over the intended 
licensing body, the Louisiana State Police."
214,6," DeBartolo pled guilty to misprision of a felony in violation of Title 18, United States Code Section 4 on October 6, 1998. Guidry 
pled guilty to conspiracy in violation of Title 18, U.S.C. § 371 on October 16, 1998. See U.S. v. Edwards, 39 F. Supp. 2d 716, 
720 n. 7."
214,7," Specifically,  [**7] Astoria, by its original and amending petitions, asserted one or more of the following causes of action against 
the defendants: (1) intentional interference with economic advantage and/or prospective economic advantage; (2) unjust 
enrichment to the extent that the defendants were unjustly enriched to the detriment and impoverishment of Astoria; (3) civil 
conspiracy to corrupt the licensing process; (4) punitive damages under California law for fraud; (5) treble damages under the 
California business code for unfair trade practices; and (6) violations of the Louisiana Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer 
Protection Law, La. R.S. 51:1401 et seq. "
215,8," Alternatively, Guidry argued that he was entitled to summary judgment because Astoria's claims were barred by prescription 
and res judicata. "

220,11," The Court cited to We, Inc. v. City of Philadelphia, 174 F.3d 322, 326-27 (3d Cir.1999)(""This court, along with other courts, has 
by analogy extended the Noerr-Pennington doctrine to offer protection to citizens' petitioning activities in contexts outside the 
antitrust area as well…. [T]he purpose of Noerr-Pennington as applied in areas outside the antitrust field is the protection of the 
right to petition.""); and Video Int'l Production, Inc. v. Warner-Amex Cable Communications, Inc., 858 F.2d 1075, 1084 (5th 
Cir.1988) (""[a]lthough the Noerr-Pennington doctrine initially arose in the antitrust field, other circuits have expanded it to protect

239,2," HN14[
] Unlike a conspiracy to commit mail or wire fraud, a conspiracy to commit to retaliate against a witness may serve as 
a predicate act because it is specifically included in the statutory offense and therefore ""indictable under"" the listed statute. Cf. 
United States v. Brooklier, 685 F.2d 1208, 1216 (9th Cir. 1983) (finding conspiracy to extort under 18 U.S.C. 1951 a proper 
predicate  [*28] because conspiracy is ""indictable under"" that provision)."
239,3," Plaintiff alleges that at this point, Mr. Knowlton was working for Arctic Glacier after it purchased Party Time."
239,4," For instance, Plaintiff claims that Home City has already entered into a plea agreement with the United States, in which Home 
City admits that it participated in a conspiracy among packaged ice producers to allocate customers and territories for packaged 
ice. (Compl. P 51). Plaintiff also alleges that while he was still working at Arctic Glacier, Mr. Corbin told him that ""Arctic Glacier 
had agreed with both Home City and Reddy Ice to geographically divide the market for the sale and delivery of packaged ice."" 
(Compl. P 35). Plaintiff further provides an account from Mr. Corbin, where he describes how Arctic Ice backed away from 
buying an ice company in Nevada as part of an agreement between Arctic Ice and Reddy Ice, where Arctic Ice  [*32] agreed to 
stay out of the South and Southwest. (Compl. P 36). "
241,5," HN17[
] ""The standard is the same for both criminal and civil RICO violations."" United States v. Shifman, 124 F.3d 31, 35 n.1 (1st Cir. 1997) (citing 18 U.S.C. § 1962)."
241,6," Johnson, 440 F.3d at 840 (""'Turkette requires the government to prove both the existence of an ""enterprise"" and a ""pattern of 
racketeering activity."" We do not, however, read Turkette to hold that proof of these separate elements be distinct and 
independent[.]'"") (quoting Qaoud, 777 F.2d at 1115). "
242,7," Both Arctic Glacier and Home City cite Moon for the proposition that ""open-ended continuity . . . requires that 'the predicate 
acts or offenses are part of an ongoing entity's regular way of doing business.'"" (Arctic Glacier Br. at 9 (quoting Moon, 465 F.3d 
at 726-27)). As the quoted passage above from Moon indicates, this simply is not the case. HN23[
] A plaintiff may also set 
forth factual allegations showing a distinct threat of continuing racketeering activity. "
243,8," In Moon, the Sixth Circuit reasoned that there was no risk of ongoing racketeering because the plaintiff petitioned the Michigan 
Workers' Disability Compensation Bureau (""Bureau""), which could result in a final binding decision to prevent the defendants 
from continuing to commit the alleged predicate acts against the plaintiff--namely, suspending the plaintiff's benefits--without first 
going through the Bureau. That is, once a decision  [*44] was made by the Bureau, the defendants would have to seek approval 
from the Bureau before petitioning the plaintiff's benefits. In the instant case, there is no such mechanism that would essentially 
guarantee the cessation of the alleged predicate acts."
243,9," Some circuits have more exacting standards, while others are less stringent. Compare Brouwer v. Raffensperger, Hughes & 
Co.., 199 F.3d 961, 965 (7th Cir. 2001) (""'[The plaintiff] must allege (1) that each defendant agreed to maintain an interest in or 
control of an enterprise or to participate in the affairs of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity and (2) that each 
defendant further agreed that someone would commit at least two predicate acts to accomplish those goals.'"") with United States 
v. Browne, 505 F.3d 1229, 1263 (11th Cir. 2007) (""The touchstone of liability is an agreement to participate in a RICO 
conspiracy, which may be shown in two ways: (1) showing an agreement on the overall objective of the conspiracy, or (2) 
showing that a defendant agreed to commit personally two predicate acts, thereby agreeing to participate in a 'single 
objective.'""). "
244,10," Although Quinonez and Nichols addressed the ""business or property"" requirement of the Clayton Act, the RICO ""business or 
property"" requirement was modeled  [*49] after and has been interpreted consistent with the Clayton Act. Evans v. City of 
Chicago, 434 F.3d 916, 929 n. 23 (7th Cir. 2003). "
245,11," Both Home City and Arctic Glacier initially based their Motions to Dismiss, in part, on the grounds that Plaintiff cannot recover 
for Defendants' alleged conspiracy to allocate markets. Such an interpretation is understandable given Plaintiff's somewhat 
vague allegation that Defendants have violated the Sherman Act ""by and through their anticompetitive actions as outlined 
herein,"" which might seem to include the alleged conspiracy to allocate markets. In his Response to those motions, however, 
Plaintiff clarifies that his antitrust claims seek recovery for Defendants' conspiracy to boycott Plaintiff from the packaged ice 
industry, not for their conspiracy to allocate markets. (Pl.'s Resp. to Home City's Mot. to Dismiss at 6). Therefore, the Court only 
focuses on the alleged conspiracy to boycott Plaintiff from the packaged ice industry."

260,1," There is also securities litigation against the Packaged Ice Defendants, and a separate civil case brought by a former employee 
of one of the Defendants. "

as the ""System."" Collectively, the appellees will be referred to simply  [*2] as ""Spohn."""
282,2," The parties refer at various times to four amended original petitions filed by Dr. Puentes between 2002 and 2007; however, 
 [*4] the record before this Court contains only the initial original petition filed by Dr. Puentes on November 22, 2002."
282,3," Dr. Puentes's 2002 petition contained the following paragraph asserting a cause of action under the TFEAA: Defendants have violated the Texas Anti-Trust and Restraint of Trade statutes in that they have refused to allow Plaintiff to 
obtain reimbursement for MRI and like services, upon a referral basis for Network patients. Defendants have refused to 
allow Plaintiff to be reimbursed for these services at its business location while protecting Defendant hospital from 
competition. Because of Defendants['] share of the hospital market in conjunction with the insurance network, Defendants 
through their joint enterprise have restrained trade and restricted access to Plaintiff's services."
282,4," As noted supra note 2, Dr. Puentes's second amended petition does not appear in the record. "
283,5," This motion was for ""partial"" summary judgment in that it only addressed Dr. Puentes's antitrust and tortious interference 
causes of action."
283,6," On appeal, Dr. Puentes challenges the summary judgment orders solely as they relate to his claims under the TFEAA. 
Accordingly, we may not disturb the judgments as they relate to his other causes of action. See TEX. R. APP . P . 47.1; Martinez 
v. El Paso County, 218 S.W.3d 841, 844 (Tex. App.--El Paso 2007, pet. dism'd) HN1[
] (""When reviewing a civil matter, an 
appellate court has no discretion to consider an issue not raised in the appellant's brief.""). "
284,7," It is undisputed that Dr. Puentes's TFEAA claims allege violations of only either subsection 15.05(a) or (b), or both, but not 
 [*11] of any other provision of section 15.05. See, e.g., TEX. BUS. & COM. CODE ANN. § 15.05 (c) (Vernon 2002) (prohibiting 
exclusive dealing contracts); id. § 15.05(d) (prohibiting mergers or acquisitions that substantially lessen competition); id. § 
15.05(e)(1) (prohibiting certain employment restrictions). "
286,8," As Justice Stevens stated: HN17[
] One problem presented by the language of [section] 1 of the Sherman Act is that it cannot mean what it says. The statute says that ""every"" contract that restrains trade is unlawful. But . . . restraint is the very essence of every contract; 
read literally, [section] 1 would outlaw the entire body  [*19] of private contract law. Yet it is that body of law that establishes 
the enforceability of commercial agreements and enables competitive markets--indeed, a competitive economy--to function 
effectively. Nat'l Soc'y of Prof'l Eng'rs v. United States, 435 U.S. 679, 687-88, 98 S. Ct. 1355, 55 L. Ed. 2d 637 (1978) (footnotes omitted); 
see United States v. Topco Assocs., 405 U.S. 596, 606, 92 S. Ct. 1126, 31 L. Ed. 2d 515 (1972) (""Were [section] 1 to be read in 
the narrowest possible way, any commercial contract could be deemed to violate it.""). "
287,9," The proscription against monopolies applies with equal force to both service and product markets. C.E. Servs., Inc. v. Control 
Data Corp., 759 F.2d 1241, 1245 n.1 (5th Cir. 1985)."
287,10," Because we find that the trial court's no-evidence summary judgment was justified on these grounds, we need not address the 
other grounds for no-evidence summary judgment asserted by Spohn. See TEX R. APP. P. 47.1; Dow Chem. Co. v. Francis, 46 
S.W.3d 237, 242 (Tex. 2001). We also need not address Spohn's traditional motion for summary judgment. See TEX. R. APP. P. 
47.1; Ford Motor Co. v. Ridgway, 135 S.W.3d 598, 600 (Tex. 2004) (noting that, HN19[
] if the plaintiffs fail to produce more 
 [*22] than a scintilla of evidence under the no-evidence summary judgment burden, then there is no need to analyze whether 
plaintiff's proof satisfied the traditional summary judgment burden). "
293,1," Plaintiffs purport to bring their class allegations pursuant to Fed R. Civ. P. 23(a), (b)(2), and (b)(3). Six other direct purchaser 
actions have been filed and those related actions have been consolidated here. The representative Plaintiffs named in those 
actions (and corresponding case numbers) are: Wilmington Steel Processing Co., Inc. (08-5371); Supreme Auto Transport (08-
5468); Capow, Inc. d/b/a Eastern States Steel (08-5633); MPM Display, Inc. (08-5700); REM Systems, Inc. (08-5942); and Alco 
Industries, Inc. (08-6197). "
294,2," See Hishon v. King & Spalding, 467 U.S. 69, 73, 104 S. Ct. 2229, 81 L. Ed. 2d 59 (1984). In addition, Defendants attached to 
their joint motion a collection of the underlying sources for various statements quoted in the complaint. For purposes of ruling on 
this joint motion to dismiss, I consider these materials in their entirety because they are quoted in the complaint and are central 
to Plaintiffs' claim. See Twombly, 550 U.S. at 569 n.13."
294,3," Steel producers Arcelor and Mittal Steel merged in November 2007. The merged corporation, ""ArcelorMittal,""  [**11] is a 
named Defendant here, though the facts as alleged refer to either ""Arcelor"" or ""Mittal"" at various intervals to describe conduct by 
one or the other producer prior to the merger. "
295,4," Although not explicitly stated in the pleadings, I understand steel producer ""IPSCO"" is the predecessor to named Defendant 
SSAB Swedish Steel Corporation."
295,5," Defendants argue in their reply brief that this 2006 statement was based upon a 2000 ITC decision that described the state of 
the steel industry before the wave of bankruptcies and mergers between 2000 and 2004 (see discussion infra Part II.B.) and also 
upon a 2000 study by the U.S. Department of Commerce. The Department of Commerce study found that the industry is 
characterized by high fixed costs which, in part, put ""pressure on companies to keep mills running even when market signals 
may be indicating the need for production cutbacks, the temporary idling of facilities or even the elimination of capacity."" In 
support of these findings, Defendants cite to a March 2005 address at the Steel Business Briefing Conference by Arcelor 
executive Louis Schorsch, in which Schorsch commented  [**14] that ""the industry's cost structure has improved, particularly in 
North America, as fixed costs have been reduced as a proportion of total costs. This reduces the urgency of maintaining volume 
in a downturn, thus reducing the pressure to 'race for the bottom.'"" While true that the 2000 study reported on the contemporaneous nature of the steel industry, I accept as true for purposes of this 
motion the basic premise that the production of steel involves ""high fixed costs"" due to the uncontroverted evidence regarding its 
capital-intensive nature. Defendants may argue how new aspects of the industry serve to explain their alleged anticompetitive 
behavior, but I will not at this stage discredit Plaintiffs' reliance on facts about maximizing output that are based upon the 
assumption of high fixed costs. "
296,6," With regard to supply and demand, Plaintiffs allege that the industry's production ""discipline"" came at the expense of the 
domestic manufacturing sector and other direct purchasers of steel, which suffered from supply shortages caused by 
Defendants' coordinated downtime. Contrary to Defendants' assertions in  [**16] the trade press that ""oversupply"" justified their 
downtime, Plaintiffs allege that the domestic market was in fact under-supplied during the conspiracy period. Some of Plaintiffs' allegations in support of their contention that annual domestic demand far exceeded domestic production 
throughout the conspiracy period include: . The president of the AISI, a leading industry trade association, explained in February 2005 that ""North American steel capacity 
will be insufficient to meet steel demand for the foreseeable future."" . On April 26, 2005, just before the first round of alleged coordinated downtime, U.S. Steel reported that, ""Looking forward, key 
economic data suggests that North American demand for [U.S. Steel products] will remain favorable."" . With respect to ""long"" products, Commercial Metals reported on June 21, 2005 that ""markets for our products are strong"" and 
that ""margins are pushing all time highs."" One week later, immediately after the June 20-22, 2005 Steel Success Strategies 
Conference, Commercial Metals announced market downtime. . In July 2005, during the mid-2005 production cuts, Nucor's Executive Vice President (""EVP"") John Ferriola explained that 
""[d]espite a challenging  [**17] market in the second quarter we remain optimistic concerning the balance of 2005. End use 
demand remains strong . . . our service center customers are telling us that their inventories are under historical levels. . . . 
Nonresidential construction is showing strength and should add to the demand in the third quarter."" For steel sheet Ferriola said 
""order entry levels have increased significantly over the past four weeks"" and Nucor's sheet mills were already ""85% booked 
through the end of August."" Nucor's CEO Dan DiMicco reported that ""demand for sheet continues to improve, and we've seen 
almost a 200% uptick in orders over the last seven weeks."" . On July 25, 2005, IPSCO reported that it ""believes that end user demand for steel mill products will remain strong in increase 
throughout the year."" . During the late-2006 production cuts, Nucor stated that ""demand remains good"" for sheet; the ""plate market has remained 
robust""; and long product ""demand, mill inventories and backlogs remain at good levels."" As early as July 2006, Nucor's CEO 
noted that the domestic market was strong and that ""a lot of steel companies"" already were sold out through the end of 2006. . In May 2007, before the 2007  [**18] downtime, Gerdau reported ""solid underlying demand"" across ""all product lines,"" including 
""continued sound demand for our long products and continued firming and rebounding of demand for our hot rolled sheet 
products."" . In November 2007, Lakshmi Mittal reported during ArcelorMittal's earnings conference call that ""the level of imports has 
reduced dramatically"" and ""real demand has not fundamentally deteriorated despite price volatility."" In addition, Plaintiffs present October 2006 statements by a Toyota representative who testified in proceedings before the ITC 
that, ""for the first time in my 19 plus years working for Toyota, when we approached suppliers and told them . . . that we are able 
to increase some of our volumes, instead of smiles and high-fives, we were met with no, we can't support that."" According to the 
same representative, in the spring of 2006, Toyota was ""surprised when two of our suppliers, citing capacity constraints, 
effectively imposed a maximum volume commitment that [was] lower than the volume we sought."" Similarly, a Chrysler 
representative testified at the October 2006 hearing that, ""we at the Chrysler group have had consistent and increasing 
shortages recently  [**19] of products for, actually for committed tons. I get calls every Saturday, that famous Friday night call or 
Saturday morning call, the plant's running and we don't have our steel here. It happens throughout the week more frequently 
than we would like to have to deal with. . . . it started in earnest about a year ago and it's gotten progressively worse."" A 
purchasing manager for General Motors also testified about domestic steel shortages, observing that shortages ""became 
sufficiently critical around the third quarter of '05 that we had to assemble a crisis center."" Finally, a brief submitted to the ITC by 
the Motor Equipment Manufacturers Association and the Precision Metalforming Association states that ""23 out of 31 purchasers "
297,," reported problems with supply, including being placed on allocation or controlled order entry, and that such supply shortages 
have continued into 2006 for some purchasers."" That brief stated in summary, ""the record in this case clearly demonstrates that 
supply problems are ongoing. U.S. steel producers are still unable to supply all of U.S. steel consumers' requirements,"" thus 
evidencing ""a fundamental deficit in the domestic industry's ability to supply U.S.  [**20] demand."" Defendants counter these statements by citing to the corresponding ITC determination which was issued in January 2007. 
According to the ITC, ""[w]hile automotive customers described the phenomenon as a type of shortage or allocation, we do not 
view that as an entirely accurate description. Rather, it appears as if automotive customers generally could obtain the necessary 
steel, but they had to pay more as they were competing against higher spot market prices."" The ITC also observed ""that this was 
a new phenomenon."" Defendants also cite to an October 2006 report from a steel industry analyst describing ""[a] current oversupply of steel in the 
United States"" which ""has pushed the country's steel industry into something of a 'mini-crisis.'"" Managing Director Christopher 
Plummer of Metal Strategies, Inc., a corporation that provides management consulting to the steel industry, attributed the so-
called 'mini-crisis' to ""major inventory buildups of steel at the service center level"" due to ""excess production and exports from 
China."" Plummer predicted the crisis to end in three to six months. ""[S]teel producers . . . clearly are taking the lead by cutting 
back production or moving up  [**21] maintenance outages. They have addressed the supply situation very quickly. . . [m]oving 
more quickly than they did the last time."" "
302,7," On or about October 4, 2006, U.S. Steel closed a blast furnace in Illinois. On or about October 6, 2006, ArcelorMittal 
announced the indefinite shutdown of two United States blast furnaces for the purpose of limiting supply. On or about October 9, 
U.S. Steel closed another blast furnace in Indiana."
302,8," Ferriola, Nucor's EVP, explained that the fourth quarter is ""typically a quarter where you have a seasonal slowdown to begin 
with. No one accepts  [**41] anything between Christmas and New Year anymore and you lose about five days at Thanksgiving 
every year, so right off the bat you're looking at about two weeks of shipping time right there. . . . The other thing is the weather. 
In the October/November timeframe, you're not in the heat of summer and you're not yet in the freezing cold of the dead of 
winter. That makes it more advantageous to take the outages now."""
302,9," Landa also estimated 85% - 86% ""is a pretty good quarter."""
302,10," Steel Dynamics' 2006 Annual Report highlights the fact that these significant cutbacks in production were in response to 
slowing order rates. This explanation is repeated throughout the record before me by many, if not all, Defendants. Defendants 
argue that Plaintiffs cite the fact of production cuts out of context. At this stage, however, Plaintiffs are entitled to assume that 
Defendants' proffered explanation is not true in part or in whole. In many instances, Plaintiffs have not so much taken quoted 
language out of context as they have set forth the largely uncontested facts relating to the timing and the extent of the production 
cuts made by each Defendant producer. The explanation for those cuts -- indeed, the  [**42] crux of this case -- cannot be 
proven by a statement in an annual report, much the same as some alternate explanation is not proven by various other 
statements made by steel executives or industry analysts, or by the fact that those executives attended certain meetings on 
certain dates. The question now is one of facial plausibility, which I take up in the discussion section, infra Part III. That 
plausibility determination will be made ""on the ASSUMPTION THAT ALL THE allegations in the complaint are true (even if 
doubtful in fact)."" Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555-56 (citation omitted). For the most part, Plaintiffs have alleged a fair and plausible 
reading of the cited sources. Plaintiffs may be incorrect, but whether they are seriously incorrect is a matter for summary 
judgment or trial. "
303,11," John Ferriola, Nucor's EVP, explained that the production discipline also ""provided a more stable pricing environment during 
the period we were negotiating our 2007 contracts. . . . This approach is consistent with Nucor's long-standing focus on long-
term profitability."""
303,12," Commercial Metals announced price increases from $ 15/ton in February 2007, to $ 30/ton in March 2007, and $ 55/ton in 
April 2007. "
304,13," Plaintiffs also allege that an October 2007 statement by Steel Dynamics CEO Busse indicates that producers were 
coordinating not only on output, but also on price: ""I clearly would tell you there are folks out there that speak with a forked 
tongue. They raised the price and then backed off. There's just no doubt about it and -- but we're not one of them, frankly, and it 
may have hurt us in the order entry a little bit. We've pretty much held the line on our price."" "
306,14," For example, executives from Mittal, U.S. Steel, Nucor, Steel Dynamics, Gerdau, Commercial Metals, and IPSCO met in May 
2005; immediately thereafter Mittal and U.S. Steel idled some of their steel mills. As more specifically detailed in the factual 
allegations section, supra Part II.B, after additional meetings involving additional Defendants, several more  [**60] Defendants "
307,," cut production. Immediately after a meeting on October 1-3, 2006, in Argentina, attended by at least ArcelorMittal, U.S. Steel, 
Nucor, and Gerdau, all Defendants cut production. Mid-2007 downtime followed meetings in May and June involving executives 
from every Defendant. That Defendants participated in numerous industry, trade association, and trade show meetings does not 
make the timing of those meetings with the production cuts any less suspicious; if anything the fact that Defendants' executives 
were in regular contact makes the allegation of agreement more, not less, plausible."
307,15," For example, Plaintiffs allege that U.S. Steel explained in an October 2006 brief filed with the ITC that the steel industry's ""high 
fixed costs"" encourage competitive producers to  [**63] ""maximize and sustain the utilization of available capacity."" In re Certain 
Carbon Steel Products, Prehearing Br. of U.S. Steel, 10/6/06, at 8-9. Likewise, Nucor and Steel Dynamics, exclusive minimill 
producers, have argued that ""[t]he steel industry is characterized by high fixed costs and relatively inelastic demand, particularly 
in the short term"" which gives producers ""a strong incentive to maintain or increase capacity utilization."" In re Certain Carbon 
Steel Products, Prehearing Br. of Nucor and Steel Dynamics, 10/6/06, at 6. "
308,16," For instance, Nucor's DiMicco insists that his company's ""short-term  [**66] performance is not tied to any one market"" 
because of its product line diversity. For example, the composition of Nucor sales in 2006 was 38% sheet, 15% beams, 11% 
plate, and 7% down-stream steal products."
308,17," For certain steel products, the impact  [**67] of imports during the relevant period was even greater. See Certain Circular 
Welded Carbon Quality Steel Line Pipe from China and Korea, USITC Pub. No. 4003, Inv. Nos. 701-TA-455 and 731-TA-1149-
1150 (Preliminary), at 14, 17 (May 2008) (finding that from 2005 to 2007 steel line pipe imports increased from about 20% to 
over 50% and attributing ""decline in [domestic line pipe] profitability to the presence of low-priced subject imports and their price-
suppressing effects""); Carbon and Certain Alloy Steel Wire Rod from Brazil, Canada, Indonesia, Mexico, Trinidad and Tobago, 
and Ukraine, USITC Pub. No. 4014, Inv. Nos. 701-TA-417 and 731-TA-953, 954, 957-59, 961, and 962 (Review), at I-37 (Table

308,18," The same was not true in July 2005, however, when Nucor reported that ""[c]urrent levels of steel imports are down, and import 
license requests have decreased."" "
310,19," The ITC has attributed the ""industry's higher profitability from 2004 through the first half of 2006 . . . in large part to the 
restructuring by many U.S. producers that permitted them to terminate pension and healthcare liabilities and  [**74] secure less 
costly labor contracts."" Certain Carbon Steel Products, USTIC Pub. No. 3899, Inv. Nos. AA1921-197 (Second Review); 701-TA-

321,2," In Westerfield v. Quiznos Franchise Co., LLC, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 74398, 2008 WL 2512467, *10 (E.D. Wis. Apr. 16, 2008), 
 [*5] discussed fully infra, the Court summarizes the franchisees' allegations that: through their intentional misrepresentations and omissions, the defendants fraudulently induced them to enter into 
agreements that allow Quiznos to compel them to purchase the services, goods and materials essential to their businesses 
at grossly inflated prices from which Quiznos directly or indirectly profits. Then, when they can no longer withstand the 
losses caused by Quiznos' exploitation and go out of business, plaintiffs allege that Quiznos obtains releases of any claims 
against it by threatening the franchisees with a lawsuit to enforce provisions of the Franchise Agreement that purport to 
render them liable for payment of royalties over the entire 15-year term of the Agreement. The closures are then used to 
facilitate the movement of a lengthy list of equally deceived franchisees awaiting store locations, into the same, now-vacant 
and bankrupt locations. Though such a practice would seem counter to the interests of a franchisor whose own income is 
dependent upon the success of its franchisees, plaintiffs allege that Quiznos' actual motivation is not to establish stable and 
economically strong franchisees  [*6] for the long term. Instead, plaintiffs allege, the defendants' real motivation is 'to inflate 
Quiznos' profitability and make it more attractive to potential buyers and investors, toward the ultimate goal of allowing the 
Schadens and other Quiznos insiders to sell their ownership interest for billions of dollars.' The first of these franchisee class actions was filed in 2006. The Quiznos franchise empire is alleged to have begun with 
acquisition of the brand by the Schadens in 1992, at which time there were 18 stores. Quiznos was operated as a public 
company from 1994 through 2000, during which time it grew to over 1000 stores worldwide. The Schadens then wished to take 
the company private again and asserted a ""fair value"" of $ 8.50 a share, which was challenged by the outside shareholders and 
reset by the Court at $ 32.50, in a ruling that found the proxy statement to have been ""an exercise in obfuscation."" See, e.g., 
Brunet v. Quizno's Franchise Co., LLC, No. 07-CV-01717 (D. Colo.), Docket No. 118, Amended Complaint at PP 85-86. Quiznos 
then allegedly stopped operating as a legitimate franchise operation and became an enterprise directed toward inflating its 
apparent profitability  [*7] for resale (through aggressive nationwide sales of franchises, abuses of marketing and advertising 
funds to capitalize national advertising and system growth, and profits in the mandated supplier business). Id. In April 2006, J.P. 
Morgan paid $ 585 Million for a 49% interest in Quiznos. Id. at P 99."

Co, LLC, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25907 at *18))."
321,4," See, e.g., Defendants' Memorandum of Law In Support of Motion to Dismiss at 3 (asserting that ""the claims attempted . . . fly in 
the face of the disclosures each Plaintiff was provided in advance of his or her election to become a Quiznos franchisee, and are 
contradicted by the explicit terms of the parties' agreements""); id. (asserting that ""the UFOC and the Franchise Agreements 
expressly disclosed information on which several of the claims are based, and Plaintiffs thus cannot claim they were not aware 
of this information"")."
321,5," Owing in part to the limited/selective disclosure of related decisions in the Defendants' pleadings, and Defendants' sometimes 
misleading characterization of decisions discussed, and in part to general inadequacies of Plaintiff's Brief in Opposition, the 
Court has now familiarized itself with the pleadings in all of the pending related cases. See infra Section II. Cf. Sands v. "
322,," McCormick, 502 F.3d 263, 268 (3d Cir. 2007) (""Generally, in ruling on a motion to dismiss,  [*9] a district court relies [only] on 
the complaint, attached exhibits, and matters of public record."")."
322,6," These individuals, generally referred to as the ""sold but not opened"" or ""SNO"" classes, commonly invested approximately $ 
20,000 to $ 25,000 but never obtained a restaurant. These cases include most notably Bonanno v. The Quiznos Franchise Co. LLC, Case No. 06-CV-2358, currently pending before 
Judge Arguella (to whom the case was reassigned from Judge Daniel in October, 2008) in the District of Colorado. Bonanno is a 
putative national class action alleging that Quiznos generated approximately $ 75 Million in  [*10] franchise fees from these 
investors. It alleges that Quiznos fraudulently sold rights to operate franchises in areas where it did not/would not have 
available/feasible locations, resold the same trade areas to multiple franchisees after coercing franchisees to switch trade areas, 
unreasonably denied site approvals, intentionally concealed the fact that the large majority of franchises sold would never be 
open for business, and made other misrepresentations. Bonanno was removed from the New Jersey State Court to the District 
Court of that jurisdiction and, in March 2006, was transferred to the Colorado District Court on Defendants' Motion and pursuant 
to the forum selection clause of the franchise agreements. Defendants' Motion to Dismiss was denied in its entirety by Judge 
Daniel, largely on grounds that (1) the allegations of the Complaint (including claims for common law fraud, breach of contract, 
and breach of a duty of good faith and fair dealing) were sufficient for plaintiffs to proceed on their claims, and (2) Defendants' 
defenses based on contract language were premature prior to the Court's consideration of evidence on unenforceability. See 
2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21678, 2008 WL 638367 (D. Colo. March 5, 2008).  [*11] Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification was 
recently denied by Judge Arguello, who held the franchise agreements' class action waiver enforceable under Colorado law. See 
Defendants' Suggestion of Decision. Cf. discussion infra. Judge Arguello's decision is currently on interlocutory appeal to the 
Tenth Circuit and the case has been stayed on Order following a Joint Unopposed Motion. See also Elhilu v. Quiznos Franchise Co., LLC, Case No. 06-CV-07855, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 109435, currently pending before 
Judge Cooper in the Central District of California on behalf of SNO franchisees in that State. This Complaint alleges that - 
contrary to Quiznos representations - the franchisees were offered locations in already-filled or economically-depressed areas. It 
asserts that of approximately 1200 California franchises purposefully over-sold, 600 ultimately opened, and 300 were profitable. 
By Opinion of April 3, 2008, the Court denied Defendants' Motion to Dismiss, concluding that dismissal could not be based on a 
(1) contractual statute of limitations bar given the factual issues and questions of, e.g., equitable tolling; (2) reasonable 
reliance/parol evidence bar where fraud in the inducement was sufficiently alleged;  [*12] (3) failure to sufficiently plead unfair 
competition and other fraud claims under Rule 9(b), which must be read in harmony with Rule 8; (4) contractual restriction on 
claims against the Schaden Defendants, which would be unenforceable as against public policy; as would (5) contractual 
restrictions on punitive damages or class allegations (citing California's Civil Code provisions against contracts with the objective 
of exempting someone for responsibility for their own fraud). See Docket No. 69. The case was in Alternative Dispute Resolution 
by stipulation of the parties and a Motion for Preliminary Approval of a Settlement Class for the California SNOs was filed on 
May 11, 2009. "
323,7," RICO provides a private civil action to recover treble damages for injuries resulting from a defendant's ""racketeering activities"" 
in violation of RICO's substantive criminal provisions. See 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c)."
323,8," As he granted leave to amended, Judge Griesbach declined to address Quiznos additional arguments  [*15] in support of its 
Motion to Dismiss at that time. The Amended Complaint was filed in May, 2008 and no longer includes claims for antitrust 
violations. See Westerfield v. Quiznos Franchise Co., L.L.C., No. 06-C-1210, Docket No. 136. Defendants' Motion to Dismiss the 
Amended Complaint was filed in October, 2008, and is currently pending. See id., Docket No. 145-146. The Wisconsin Court set 
a briefing schedule on Class Certification from May through August, 2009. However, on May 15, 2009, Plaintiffs filed a Motion 
seeking to stay the action pending the Tenth Circuit's decision in Bonanno. See supra n. 6. Said Motion was granted on May 21, 
2009. Judge Griesbach indicated, nonetheless, that he would still resolve the pending Motion to Dismiss and any related 
Motions. See Docket No. 179."
323,9," Defendants' December 2008 Memorandum in Support states, as the coup de grace of its introductory summation of the 
asserted grounds for dismissal, that ""other District Courts have rejected the same antitrust, fraud and RICO claims which 
Plaintiffs' [sic] attempt to assert here."" Memorandum in Support at 2. The pleading proceeds to assert, without mention of the 
Westerfield case or other significant information, that the Complaint sub judice is ""virtually identical to the Complaint . . . which 
was filed in Siemer . . ., and which was dismissed on March 31, 2008."" Cf. infra n. 11."

324,14," The ""Quiznos Named Entities"" (i.e., those including ""Quiznos"" in their name or the identifying letter ""Q"" in their acronym name) 
are inter-related Delaware limited liability companies. The Quiznos Franchise Entities and Royalties Entity have been franchisors 
for Quiznos franchises at various times. The Quiznos Master entity licensed intellectual property to the franchise system, and 
has been the parent of a Franchise Entity. See Brunet Amended Complaint. Cervantes Capital is also a Delaware limited liability 
company, allegedly under common control of, and owning a majority interest in one or more of, the Quiznos entities. The 
relationships between the Quiznos Named Entities (including assignments of franchise agreements) appear to have been both 
fluctuating and complex. "
325,15," See also Defendants' Memorandum in Support at 2 (""The primary flaw in each of Plaintiffs' claims is that each Plaintiff, before 
signing the franchise agreement, received and presumably reviewed, a uniform franchise offering circular ('UFOC'), which made

the buying power of the system as a whole."") (emphasis added). Cf. id. n. 2 (stating that the ""disclosure document Quiznos is

Colorado; but after the Judge then assigned to the case denied Defendants' Motion to Dismiss, Defendants stopped seeking

332,34," Cf. Westerfield, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 74398, 2008 WL 2512467, *9 (referring to ""the uncertainty in federal law as to the 
significance of the element of reliance to a civil RICO claim"") (citing Anza, 126 S.Ct. at 2007 (Thomas, J., concurring in part and 
dissenting in part) (""[T]he mere fact that the predicate acts underlying a particular RICO violation happen to be fraud offenses 
does not mean that reliance, an element of common-law fraud, is also incorporated as an element of a civil RICO claim."") Two 
months later, in June, 2008, the Supreme Court held that HN12[
] a reliance element is not incorporated into RICO. See Bridge v. Phoenix Bond, 128 S. Ct. 2131, 170 L. Ed. 2d 1012 (2008) (no required showing of reliance)."
332,35," HN13[

] ""[A]t the minimum - a franchisor market power assessment 
requires reference to all alternatives available to the potential consumer in a broad line of business endeavors."") (quoting Alan 
Silberman, The Myths of Franchise ""Market Power"", 65 Antitrust L.J. 181, 206 (1996)); Tominaga v. Shepherd, 682 F.Supp.

relevant markets include take out pizza franchises, fast food franchises or restaurant franchises in general""); Defendants' 
Memorandum in Support at 10-11 (noting that a ""relevant market"" for purposes of antitrust  [*52] analysis cannot consist of a 
particular trademarked franchise business)."
333,37," The Court notes that this action does not raise statutory protections to which the franchisees may be entitled under the 
allegations of the Complaint. Cf. e.g., Bonanno, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21678, 2008 WL 638367 at *3 (concluding that plaintiffs 
residing in other states had standing to bring claim under Colorado Consumer Protection Act regulating commercial activities 
and practices, where plaintiffs alleged fraudulent scheme involving Quiznos conduct in Colorado (including policies and 
decisions  [*53] instituted there))."
333,38," See Memorandum  [*54] in Support at 19-20. Cf. Defendants' Reply Brief at 7 (""Contrary to plaintiffs' assertions, . . . 
defendants are not asking this Court for an order finding no duty to disclose exists. Rather, in this motion, defendants simply 
assert that no duty to disclose has been alleged in the complaint.""); id. (stating that although the Complaint alleges a duty to 
disclose, it does not identify the facts giving rise to such duty). Compare Memorandum in Support at 12-13 (citing as persuasive 
authority Siemer, in which ""Plaintiff's [RICO] claims based on fraud [by omission]"" failed ""because Quiznos was not under any 
duty to disclose"") (emphasis added). "
334,39," See also Reply Brief at 9 (citing, oddly, to Vaughn v. Gen. Foods Corp., 797 F.2d 1403, 1411 (7th Cir. 1986) as ""controlling"" 
case law to effect that statements regarding ""viability"" of franchise were ""not a guarantee of a particular degree of success""). As 
the citation is followed by Wisconsin case law, the Court presumes that the citations (and characterizations) were drawn from 
pleadings before the Wisconsin Court. Cf. supra n. 21."
334,40," See also id. (noting that the UFOC disclosed that ""the franchisee was required to use approved suppliers, that those approved 
suppliers may be affiliates of the franchisor, [and] that the franchisor made money through those sales""). "
336,41," The Court in Air Products further explained that ""fraud to induce a person to enter a contract is generally collateral to (i.e., not 
'interwoven' with) the terms of the contract itself"". 256 F. Supp. 2d at 341."
336,42," HN20[
] The Pennsylvania Superior Court's holding in Sullivan, as the most recent ruling of the intermediate appellate court, ""must be accorded significant weight and should not be disregarded absent persuasive indication that the highest court would 
rule otherwise."" U.S. Underwriters Ins. Co. v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 80 F.3d 90, 93 (3d Cir. 1996). "
337,43," See also Reply Brief at 16 (""[T]  [*67] he UFOC does not form the basis of a claim for breach of contract. Accordingly, 
plaintiffs' alleged breaches of contract arising out of the provisions of the UFOC fail to state a claim . . . ."")."
337,44," Cf. Memorandum in Support at 20-21  [*68] (stating that Plaintiffs could not justifiably rely on ""statements other than those in 
the franchise agreements and written UFOCs"" with citations to integration clause cases)."
337,45," Cf. Siemer, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25907, 2008 WL 905874 at *11 (""[T]he UFOC and Franchise Agreement each contain 
disclaimers and non-reliance clauses . . . . In the Franchise Agreement, each Plaintiff signed an integration clause agreeing not 
to rely on any statements not contained in the UFOC or Franchise Agreement. . . .""). This language also suggests that Judge 
Pallmeyer considered these signed Quiznos documents to reflect the parties' contractual undertakings and reliances."
337,46," Cf. Bonanno, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21678, 2008 WL 638367, *6 (noting, in denying Quiznos Motion to Dismiss claim for 
breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, that ""Colorado law imposes a duty of good faith and fair dealing in "
338,," every contract"" which may attach to ""'honor [the parties'] reasonable expectations"" and that ""may be relied upon 'when the 
manner of performance under a specific contract term allows for discretion on the part of either party'"") (citations omitted)."
338,47," The policies underlying recognition of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing are particularly apposite to the relations of 
the present parties. See Bicycle Corp. Of America v. Meridian Bank., 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17421, 1995 WL 695090, *4 (E.D. 
Pa. Nov. 21, 1995) (explaining that the doctrine is intended to ""simplif[y] arrangements between contracting parties by prohibiting 
one party from acting solely for his own benefit and to the detriment of the entire agreement "", and observing that it is intended to 
""prohibit opportunistic behavior"" not specifically addressed in the contract). "
339,48," This Court does not read Witmer as overruling Razumic or limiting it to the termination context. To the contrary, no language in Witmer suggests any disagreement with the Court's prior citation to § 205 of the 
Restatement and its concomitant recognition of a duty of good faith in every contractual undertaking. Nor does Witmer 
suggest disagreement with Razumic's holding that a franchisor has a broad duty to deal with its franchisees in good faith. 
Rather, it merely distinguishes the circumstances before it and declines to apply Razumic's ""articulat[ion]"" of  [*75] the 
standards for franchisor conduct to a non-termination, express-written-provision case. GNC Franchising, 443 F. Supp. 2d at 752. Cf. Robert W. Emerson, Franchise Contract Clauses and the Franchisor's Duty of 
Care Toward its Franchisees, 72 N. Car. L. Rev. 905, 931-32 & n. 113 (1994) (""The same policy reasons for having a 'good 
cause' termination standard apply to a franchisor's use of certain other franchise agreement provisions [in which] the franchisee 
is arguably at the mercy of the franchisor, and the franchisee's bargaining position is weakened severely by its sunk costs at 
risk.""); Cottman Transmission Sys., LLC v. Kershner, 536 F. Supp. 2d 543, 555 (E.D. Pa. 2008) (concluding that even if 
Pennsylvania Supreme Court were to limit duty to franchise termination cases, an ""indirect termination"" by, e.g., failure to 
provide necessary and promised support, leaving franchisees ""unable to maintain a viable store"" would be encompassed)."
339,49," Defendants also seek enforcement of a purported waiver of punitive damages. However, Defendants appear to cite no 
authority whatsoever for their assertion that Plaintiffs have contractually waived their rights to any claim for punitive relief. See 
Memorandum in Support at 27-28. Accordingly, this portion of their Motion will be denied. "
340,50," As discussed supra, this Court is aware that this issue is on appeal in the Tenth Circuit. However, it does not appear that the 
Colorado District Court or the parties on appeal have addressed the applicability of federal law to the class action waiver issue. 
In this Court's view, the federal law question is a threshold question."
340,51," Indeed, the Bonanno court explicitly recognized the purely  [*80] procedural nature of class certification: HN26[
] ""Federal Rule 23 clearly remains a procedural tool, not a substantive or jurisdictional right"". Bonanno, supra, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 37702 
at *36."
340,52," See, e.g., Homa v. American Express Co., 558 F.3d 225 (3d Cir. 2009)."
340,53," This Court has also identified cases considering the enforceability of state statutory restrictions on class actions in certain 
contexts.  [*81] See, e.g., O'Keefe v. Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC, 214 F.R.D. 266, 285-86 (E.D. Pa. 2003) (concluding that state 
law ban was a procedural (and not a substantive) law, and so ""not binding on a Federal Court under the Erie doctrine"", which 
directs that federal court sitting in diversity enforce federal procedural law). But compare In re Automotive Refin`ishing Paint 
Antitrust Litig., 515 F. Supp. 2d 544, 544-551 (E.D. Pa. 2007) (concluding that state antitrust statute's class action ban, which 
was substantive law and not in conflict with Rule 23, was applicable in federal court) with Erwin Chemerinsky, Federal "
341,," Jurisdiction, § 5.3 at 317 (Aspen Law & Business 4th ed. 2003) (""[I]t is now clearly established that the Federal Rules of Civil 
Procedure . . . are to be applied by the federal court, even if there is a conflicting state requirement and even if the application of 
the federal Rule might determine the outcome of the case.""). Cases regarding state statutory limitations that are part and parcel 
of a right of action are not, however, analogous to the private contractual limitation at issue sub judice."
341,54," In Jumara, the  [*83] Third Circuit observed that validity of a forum selection clause under federal law ""requires that there have 
been no 'fraud, influence, or overweening bargaining power'"". Jumara, 55 F.3d at 880, quoting The Bremen v. Zapata Off-Shore 
Co., 407 U.S. 1, 12-13, 92 S. Ct. 1907, 32 L. Ed. 2d 513 (1972)."
341,55," In Ellerman Lines, the Third Circuit stated that Rule 42(a) ""confers upon a district court broad power, whether at the request of 
a party or upon its own initiative, to consolidate causes for trial as may facilitate the administration of justice."" 339 F.2d at 675."
341,56," Plaintiffs have alleged that this lawsuit may be maintained as a class action pursuant to both Rule 23(b)(2) and Rule 23(b)(3). 
See Second Amended Complaint PP 78, 79."
341,57," It might be contended that a contractual class action waiver should be treated as a request for exclusion from the class, 
consideration of which is contemplated within the governing framework under Rule 23(c)(2)(B)(v). However, such exclusion is 
not permitted from a class certified under Rule 23(b)(2). See Advisory Committee Note to 2003 Amendment, subdivision (c)(2) 
(""There is no right to request exclusion from a . . . (b)(2) class.""). And although class members have the right to opt out of a Rule 
23(b)(3) class, Rule 23 contemplates that they will be afforded the opportunity to elect whether to request exclusion only 
following receipt of a detailed, court-approved notice that clearly states, inter alia, the nature  [*86] of the action and the class 
claims or issues. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(2)(B). Treating a blanket class action waiver secured by a potential defendant before 
any claims or issues had arisen as a request for exclusion by the potential class member would contravene not only the letter of 
Rule 23's notice provision but also its evident purpose to encourage informed, timely election of participation or exclusion. "
342,58," It would be surprising indeed if parties could override a judicial consolidation order simply by agreeing that they prefer to have 
their own separate adjudication. A fortiori, parties should not be held effectively to have precluded consolidation by agreeing to 
such a preference in advance."
342,59," Compare  [*87] Bonanno,2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21678, slip op. at 24: There is no question that class actions serve the goals of judicial efficiency and practicality by making multi-party litigation 
more expeditious and economical. See Califano [v. Yamasaki], 442 U.S. [682,] 701, 99 S. Ct. 2545, 61 L. Ed. 2d 176 
[(1979)] (""[T]he class-action device saves the resources of both the courts and the parties by permitting an issue potentially 
affecting every [class member] to be litigated in an economical fashion under Rule 23."") . . . ."
342,60," If a valid class action or consolidation waiver were entitled to be accorded weight in a federal court's decision under Rule 23 or 
Rule 42, however, this Court would conclude that, as with other defenses subject to Plaintiffs' unconscionability claim, the validity 
of the waivers herein cannot or should not be determined in the present procedural posture of the case. See infra."
342,61," Defendants cite Compass Tech., Inc. v. Tseng Labs, Inc., 71 F.3d 1125, 1131 (3d Cir. 1995) for the general proposition that 
clear written agreements should be enforced. Cf. Elhilu, Case No. 06-CV-07855, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 109435 (C.D. Cal.) 
Docket No. 69, April 03, 2008 Order Denying Motion to Dismiss at 8 (denying Motion to Dismiss claims against Schaden 
Defendants because a contract to ""exempt anyone from responsibility for his own fraud . . . [is] against the policy of the law."") 
(citing California Civil Code § 1668)."
342,62," Defendants cite Smith v. Am. Equity Ins. Co., 235 F. Supp.2d 410, 412 (E.D. Pa. 2002) for the general proposition that a bi-
lateral one-year contractual limitations period may be reasonable. But, as discussed infra, the limitations period in the present 
case is not the same as to both parties' interests. "
343,63," The law of Colorado on unconscionability is essentially the same as that of Pennsylvania: ""In order to support a finding of 
unconscionability, there must be evidence in the record of some overreaching on the part of one  [*91] of the parties, such as 
that which results from an inequality of bargaining power or other circumstances in which there is an absence of meaningful 
choice on the part of the second party, together with contract terms unreasonably favorable to the first party."" Bonanno, 2008 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21678, 2008 WL 638367 at *9."
343,64," Cf. Homa v. Amer. Express Co., 558 F.3d 225, 231 (3d Cir. 2009) (noting that contract bore ""the hallmarks of a contract of 
adhesion [where] it was 'presented on a take-it-or-leave-it basis, . . . in a standardized printed form, [and] without opportunity for 
the 'adhering' party to negotiate except perhaps on a few particulars'"") (quoting Muhammad v. County Bank of Rehoboth Beach, 
Del., 189 N.J. 1, 912 A.2d 88, 96, 99 (N.J. 2006)). "
344,65," In Siemer, Judge Pallmeyer concludes that ""none of the clauses contained  [*94] within the UFOC or the Franchise 
Agreement"" warranted a finding of unconscionability, observing - erroneously - that Judge Griesbach had also ""found the 
plaintiffs' claims of unconscionability unpersuasive."" 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25907, 2008 WL 905874, *8 & n.3. "
359,1, All defendants except the City of Auburn are parties in their individual capacities only. 
361,2," The Griders asserted several other claims, but those claims are time-barred. The Griders filed this suit on November 21, 2007. 
The statute of limitations for the § 1983 claims is two years. See Owens v. Okure, 488 U.S. 235, 109 S. Ct. 573, 102 L. Ed. 2d 
594 (1989) (holding that HN3[
] § 1983 claims look to the general state law limitations statute for personal injury actions); HN4[ ] 1975 Ala. Code § 6-2-38(1) (establishing general personal injury limitations period of two years). While state law determines 
the applicable limitations period, federal law determines when a claim accrues, thus commencing the applicable state limitations 
period. Wallace v. Kato, 549 U.S. 384, 388, 127 S. Ct. 1091, 166 L. Ed. 2d 973 (2007). The Griders concede that their false-
arrest  [**12] claims against Massey arising from his November 2005 citations and the false-arrest claim against Carver, 
accruing on September 30, 2005, are barred. See Kato, 549 U.S. at 388-89 (holding that false-arrest claims generally accrue at 
the time of the false arrest or, more precisely, at the time when the false arrest or imprisonment ends). Likewise, the Griders do 
not dispute that claims against Ham, Duggan, and Meeks accruing before November 21, 2005 have expired. Any other claims arguably implicated by the lengthy complaint were not argued in the Griders' response in opposition to 
summary judgment. Accordingly, they are considered waived. See Brasseler, U.S.A. I, L.P. v. Stryker Sales Corp., 182 F.3d 888, 
892 (11th Cir. 1999) (affirming the ""unremarkable proposition that HN5[
] assertions made in the pleadings[,] … but not made 
in opposition to a motion for summary judgment, need not be considered by the district court … in ruling on the motion for 
summary judgment""). This includes any possible claims of conspiracy based on state law. "
362,3," The court does not reach the question of whether, even if no physical seizure occures, the Patrick Grider could have other 
remedies available to him--such as equal-protection or due-process claims--for the intentional issuance of citations that charge 
misdemeanor offenses without probable cause. The contours of such claims will not be examined here because Grider has not 
attempted to make any arguments implicating them. "
365,4," Neal also claimed that he did not turn off the video until he received a call from a supervising officer, Officer Maddox, telling him 
to ""wrap up"" the investigation. However, prior to cutting off, the video does not indicate a call from Maddox."
365,5," Carver also argues that, even if there was no probable cause for a bribery arrest, there was probable cause for a ""closely 
related"" offense: obstruction of governmental operations. Carver simply ignores, however, that viewing the evidence in the light 
most favorable to Grider--which would mean disbelieving all of the facts put forward by Carver because they are contradicted by 
Grider's account, including that Grider ever offered him money--Carver's fabricated story could not support probable cause for 
any offense."
365,6," Although Duggan was the City Manager and, thus, not a formal voting member of the city council, it is clear that HN16[
] 
executive officials are entitled to absolute legislative immunity when they perform legislative functions. Bogan v. Scott-Harris, 
523 U.S. 44, 55, 118 S. Ct. 966, 140 L. Ed. 2d 79 (1998). Here, the Griders include Duggan because of his purported role in 
drafting the ordinances at issue. "
366,7," Meeks mentions that any claims against him ""that occurred before November 21 2005 should be dismissed as a matter of law"" 
because of the two-year statute of limitations. Defs.' Brief (doc. no. 95) at 27. Meeks does not make any further argument, 
however, about which claims this would implicate. Moreover, Meeks was continuously engaged in calculating occupancy 
numbers for Skybar throughout 2005 and 2006, and overcrowding citations received by the Griders were based on Meeks's 
2006 calculations. Because Meeks does not point to any evidence in the record that particular calculations were finalized outside 
any specific limitations period or marshal any such evidence in a way that suggests a particular claim against him is no longer 
viable, claims against Meeks for those calculations are not barred. See Jones v. Sheehan, Young & Culp, P.C., 82 F.3d 1334, "
367,1338," (5th Cir. 1996) (HN19[
] ""Rule 56 … does not impose upon the district court a duty to survey the entire record in search of evidence to support a non-movant's  [**33] opposition.""). "
368,8," The Griders demonstrate that Meeks's application of different codes to different calculations resulted in his consistent use of 
the code that would result in the lowest occupancy calculation."
368,9," Such action would not, as intimated earlier, cure basic inconsistencies among the various codes purportedly applied by the 
defendants. "
369,10," The parties have placed the various safety codes in evidence. Meeks apparently stands by his calculations, and thus, a 
decision concerning the Griders' claims involves, in part, an inquiry into the reasonableness of the Meeks's conduct (the code 
calculations). To the extent the Griders and their counsel provided basic math or opinions on how code provisions fit together, 
the court is not bound by them but finds them instructive in its own examination and analysis."
369,11," The distinction between the two parts of this inquiry may not be conceptually clear. If two people are intentionally treated 
differently even though  [**44] they are the same in all relevant respects, it may be difficult to find a rational reason for the 
different treatment. That is, any reason offered might just as easily be offered to demonstrate why the two were not, in fact, 
actually in the same position. Perhaps the two-part test is instead meant to function as a sort of burden-shifting process."
369,12," While it may be true that calculating occupancy numbers is a discretionary decision in some sense, and that the decision 
involves many variables, the fact that a decision is discretionary does not mean that it can be arbitrary, and it does not mean that 
the reasons offered for the decision can be totally inconsistent. Simply put, even if the decision were discretionary in important 
ways, it could still have been improperly and intentionally manipulated in a way that denies equal treatment. "
370,13," The City also emphasizes that the Griders have failed to identify ""the final policy maker for the City."" Defs.' Brief (Doc. 95) at 
44. This argument appears to assume that there can be only one final policymaker for the City. This contention is incorrect, for 
HN27[
] there may be many policymakers in any municipal entity, each responsible for policy in different  [**48] areas or on 
different issues. Moreover, ""there will be cases in which policymaking responsibility is shared among more than one official or 
body."" City of St. Louis v. Praprotnik, 485 U.S. 112, 126, 108 S. Ct. 915, 99 L. Ed. 2d 107 (1988) (plurality opinion). "
372,14," Indeed, the city points out that the resolution simply extended the probationary period for the Blue Room because the Griders 
were still in blatant violation of the requirement that restaurant and lounge licenses maintain a 60:40 food alcohol ratio. (While 
the Griders appear to argue that this 60:40 ratio--a product of an earlier ordinance--was itself meant to target their business, they 
do not present a challenge to that rule.) The council expressed concern with the Griders' past inability to comply with this rule 
and noted particular skepticism at the Griders' stated desire to meet the quota by charging for a buffet at the door but not 
collecting receipts that would allow for any subsequent auditing; indeed, around the same time, the council also placed another 
similar business (Bodega), which was not owned by the Griders, on probation for the  [**55] same violations. Thus, the Griders 
have not shown that the resolution targeted their business in a unique or discriminatory way. "
373,15," In Bonner v. Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir. 1981) (en banc), HN32[
] the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals 
adopted as binding precedent all of the decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down prior to the close of business on 
September 30, 1981."
373,16," It appears that many States, as evidenced by the Eighth and Fifth Circuit cases applying Missouri and Texas law respectively, 
employ a contrary approach to the general rule of the federal courts cited above and hold instead that the statute of limitations 
does not run until the last overt act in civil conspiracy cases. See, e.g., Wyatt v. Union Mortgage Co., 24 Cal. 3d 773, 157 Cal. 
Rptr. 392, 598 P.2d 45, 53 (Cal. 1979). "
374,17," Another way to achieve consistency would be to separately punish the unlawful agreement in the civil context. After all, civil 
rights are placed in greater danger when people agree to come together to violate them. This approach, however, would conflict 
with current case law and ignore the general proposition that civil claims compensate for actual damages. "
377,18," The Griders also brought this claim against the city. In their response to the motion for summary judgment, however, the 
Griders argue only that Ham and Duggan are liable for such a claim, and they make no argument concerning why or how the city 
should be liable for this claim. As a result, any claim against the city is deemed waived. See infra note 2. Likewise, summary judgment will be granted with respect to any other claims based on state law that were not raised and 
argued in the Griders' response to the defendants' motion for summary judgment--for example, the claims for abuse of process 
against Officer Carver and Fire Inspector Massey. See id. "
378,19," Alexander (and cases following it) establishes that the tort of malicious prosecution can be based on a summons or citation, 
but it is silent on whether such a requirement to appear at a later date could be the basis of a false-arrest claim. "
382,1, The facts set-forth in this Opinion are taken from the parties' respective papers.
382,2," A Markman hearing is presently scheduled and the Court has deferred decision on some of the issues in this motion until that 
hearing is held. "
393,1," The states listed in the second amended class action complaint are Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, 
Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Oklahoma, 
Pennsylvania, Texas, Tennessee, Washington, Vermont and Virginia. (SACAC ¶¶ 143, 219.) As Carter's points out in its papers, 
Plaintiffs narrow this list down in their opposition, presumably because some of the enumerated states do in fact require vertical 
privity for implied warranty claims. (See Opp. (Carter's Mot.) at 19.) "
394,2," For purposes of convenience, the Court has included a table at the end of this Order summarizing its ruling as to each separate 
claim brought by each plaintiff against each defendant. "
395,3," The first amended class action complaint alleged claims of strict products liability, negligence, violations of the FAL and UCL, 
breach of express and implied warranties, violation of the Magnuson-Moss Act, intentional and negligent misrepresentation, and 
suppression. "
399,4," Plaintiffs fail to plead any specific factual allegations that might establish that Avery committed any misrepresentations or 
omissions, whether before or after October 2008. Although Plaintiffs refer to ""Defendants"" in paragraph 239 of the second 
amended class action complaint when alleging the post-October 2008 representations and omissions, the allegations are plainly 
directed only toward Carter's. (See SACAC ¶¶ 5, 66-68, 159 (setting forth similar allegations only against Carter's).) This is 
reinforced by the fact that Plaintiffs assert their FAL claim only against Carter's."
399,5," Plaintiffs allege that the Carter's message was published in December 2008. (SACAC ¶¶ 5, 172, 239.) It is clear, however, that 
the October 24, 2008 joint advisory issued by Carter's and the CPSC contained a link to a Carter's webpage on which the 
message was published. (See SACAC ¶ 63.) Thus, the Court assumes that the message was posted no later than October 24, 
2008."
399,6," Likewise, the Muirs purchased the clothing that harmed their child/grandchild between January 2008 and August 2008. (See 
Muir, CV 09-02943, Compl. (Docket No. 1) ¶¶ 6-7.)"
399,7," The allegation that Sanchez placed her child in Carter's tagless clothing after consulting with a pediatric dermatologist some 
time after she ceased clothing her child in Carter's apparel (SACAC ¶ 38) is insufficient to establish reliance because the only 
reasonable inference to be made from the allegation is that Sanchez was acting at the direction of her child's physician. 
Likewise, the allegation that Booth clothed her child ""in a piece of the defective apparel from the 2008 Carter's product line that "
400,," was not referenced in the [CPSC] announcement or Carter's website"" (SACAC ¶ 56) is also insufficient to establish reliance 
because Plaintiffs do not allege that Defendants purposefully concealed information regarding the tagless labels used on the 
clothing in the 2008 product line."
400,8," Although Sanchez joins Webb with respect to this claim, Norwest precludes Sanchez's claim, as the Court explained in detail 
above."
400,9," The same holds true with respect to the Muirs, who allege in their class action complaint that they purchased the Carter's 
clothing that injured their child/grandchild from Carter's stores located in California. (Muir, CV 09-02943, Compl. (Docket No. 1) 
¶¶ 6-7, 43.) "
401,10," The Court rejects Defendants' contention that Webb failed to satisfy the notice requirement set forth in section 2607(3)(A) of 
the California Commercial Code. Section 2607(3)(A) provides that a buyer of goods who has accepted tender thereof ""must, 
within a reasonable time after he or she discovers or should have discovered any breach, notify the seller of breach or be barred 
from any remedy."" Cal. Com. Code § 2607(3)(A). The purpose of the requirement is to protect sellers from stale claims. 
Metowski v. Traid Corp., 28 Cal. App. 3d 332, 104 Cal. Rptr. 599, 602 (Ct. App. 1972). Here, it is apparent that Carter's received 
notice of possible warranty claims in a letter dated November 11, 2008, and Avery received notice of such claims in a letter 
dated December 12, 2008. (Stranch Decl. ¶ 3, Ex. A (Docket No. 54-1).) Thus, the Court concludes that Defendants received 
sufficient notice of Webb's warranty claims within a reasonable time after Webb discovered the possibility of breach. "
402,11," The Court also notes that, because the Maryland, Michigan, and Texas implied-warranty-of-fitness statutes are identical to 
California's statute, cf. Cal. Com. Code § 2315, with Md. Code Ann., Com. Law § 2-315, Mich. Comp. Laws § 440.2315, and 
Tex. Bus. & Com. Code Ann. § 2.315(1), Booth, Abrams, and Sanchez cannot proceed with their implied-warranty-of-fitness 
claim under Maryland, Michigan, or Texas law for the same reasons that Webb cannot proceed with her implied-warranty-of-
fitness claim under California law."
402,12," Because Plaintiffs bring their FAL claim only against Carter's, and because they raise this argument in response to Avery's 
motion to dismiss, they refer only to the UCL and CLRA claims. The Court reasonably assumes, however, that Plaintiffs' 
argument also applies to their FAL claim. "
403,13," The proscribed acts and practices include, in pertinent part: (5) Representing that goods or services have sponsorship, approval, characteristics, ingredients, uses, benefits, or 
quantities which they do not have or that a person has a sponsorship, approval, status, affiliation, or connection which he or 
she does not have. . . . . (7) Representing that goods or services are of a particular standard, quality, or grade, or that goods are of a particular style 
or model, if they are of another. . . . . (9) Advertising goods or services with intent not to sell them as advertised. . . . . (14) Representing that a transaction confers or involves rights, remedies, or obligations which it does not have or involve, or 
which are prohibited by law. . . . . (16) Representing that the subject of a transaction has been supplied in accordance with a previous representation when it 
has not. Cal. Civ. Code § 1770(a)(5), (7), (9), (14), (16). "
404,14," Pre-Cel-Tech cases define ""unfair"" conduct as a business practice that ""offends an established public policy or . . . is immoral, 
unethical, oppressive, unscrupulous or substantially injurious to consumers."" People v. Casa Blanca Convalescent Homes, Inc., 
159 Cal. App. 3d 509, 206 Cal. Rptr. 164, 177 (Ct. App. 1984), abrogated in part by Cel-Tech, 973 P.2d at 544. Under this 
formulation, courts must engage in a balancing test whereby they must ""weigh the utility of the defendant's conduct against the 
gravity of the harm to the alleged victim."" Smith v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 93 Cal. App. 4th 700, 113 Cal. Rptr. 2d 399, 
415 (Ct. App. 2001). "
406,15," The Court previously dismissed Webb's negligent misrepresentation claim with leave to amend. (See 3/6/2009 Memorandum 
& Order at 11.) Webb chose not to re-plead the claim when she amended her complaint; thus, only the Muirs' negligent 
misrepresentation claim remains at issue in this action. In addition, the Court does not treat the Muirs' ""unjust enrichment"" and declaratory relief claims as separate claims. Declaratory 
relief is a remedy, see Stock West, Inc. v. Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, 873 F.2d 1221, 1225 (9th Cir. 1989); 
In re Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether Prods. Liab. Litig., 568 F. Supp. 2d 376, 378 n.11, 381 (S.D.N.Y. 2008), while unjust enrichment 
is ""a general principle, underlying various legal doctrines and remedies . . . [that] is synonymous with restitution . . . [and] has 
also been characterized as describing the result of a failure to make restitution,"" McBride v. Boughton, 123 Cal. App. 4th 379, 20 
Cal. Rptr. 3d 115, 121 (Ct. App. 2004) (citations, alterations, and internal quotation marks omitted). "
408,1," Defendant is sued in her individual capacity, as well as in the capacity of two business entities, Mary's Gifts & Collectibles 
Dream World and Mary's Gifts and Collectibles Dream World - Gift Shop. "
410,2, Defendant has filed no opposition to these Motions. 
415,1," Section 542.18, Florida statutes provides that ""[e]very contract, combination, or conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce in 
this state is unlawful."" Fla. Stat. § 542.18. In addition to having language similar to the Sherman Act, ""[f]ederal and Florida 
antitrust laws are analyzed under the same rules and case law."" All Care Nursing Serv. v. High Tech Staffing Servs., 135 F.3d 
740, 746 (11th Cir. 1998). Indeed. ""[t]he Florida legislature has, in effect, adopted as the law of Florida the body of antitrust law 
developed by the federal courts under the Sherman Act."" St. Petersburg Yacht Charters, Inc. v. Morgan Yacht, Inc., 457 So. 2d 
1028, 1032 (Fla. 2d DCA 1984): see also Fla. Stat. § 542.32 (""It is the intent of the Legislature that, in construing this chapter, 
due consideration and great weight be given to the interpretations of the federal courts relating to comparable federal antitrust 
statutes."") Thus, absent Florida precedent to the contrary—and not an Attorney General's opinion as PCW suggests (Doc. 39 at 
17)—the Court will consider PCW's state antitrust claim according to the same principles as its Sherman Act claim. "
416,2," For example, the Twombly Court rejected the following allegation: In the absence of any meaningful competition between the [ILECs] in one another's markets. and in light of the parallel 
course of conduct that each engaged in to prevent competition from CLECs within their respective local telephone and/or 
high speed internet services markets and the other facts and market circumstances alleged above. Plaintiffs allege [*10]  
upon information and belief that [the ILECs] have entered into a contract, combination or conspiracy to prevent competitive 
entry in their respective local telephone and/or high speed internet services markets and have agreed not to compete with 
one another and otherwise allocated customers and markets to one another. Twombly, 550 U.S. at 551 (emphasis added). "
417,3," In Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206 (11th Cir. 1981), the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit 
adopted as binding precedent all decisions of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit handed down prior to the 
close of business on September 30, 1981."
417,4, In the absence of an agreement there is no need for the Court to undertake a rule of reason analysis. 
420,1," The TTAB is an administrative tribunal of the USPTO with jurisdiction over inter partes challenges to the registration of 
trademarks. See 15 U.S.C. § 1067(a). An inter partes proceeding before the TTAB is an adversarial action between parties "
421,," regarding the registrability of a proposed trademark. An inter partes proceeding can take the form of an opposition proceeding, 
see 15 U.S.C. § 1063; a cancellation proceeding, see 15 U.S.C. § 1064; an interference proceeding, see 15 U.S.C. § 1066; or a 
concurrent use proceeding, see 37 C.F.R. § 2.42 (2006). As an administrative tribunal of limited jurisdiction, the TTAB is 
empowered only to decide whether a given trademark is registrable. See 15 U.S.C. § 1068. "
424,2," Additionally, the court notes that defendant's counsel, Mr. Brian Wunder, sent a number of settlement letters directly to the 
plaintiff's offices located in Omaha, Nebraska. Declaration of John P. Passarelli, Filing No. 25, Exhs. A and B. The court finds 
these letters provide further support for the conclusion that the defendant knew the brunt of the injury caused by its actions 
would be felt in the State of Nebraska. "
434,1," Except for the cover pages, plaintiff's Complaint (Complaint or Compl.) is written with paragraphs numbered in outline form. 
The court will cite to the Complaint accordingly. "
436,2," Though  [**10] not named in the caption, plaintiff identifies Mr. Michael Balzer and Mr. Ellis Rollins as lawyers at fault. See 
Compl. P I.A. As defendant points out, Mr. Rollins was an interested party in plaintiff's petition dismissed by the Circuit Court of 
Cecil County, as were the Maryland Department of the Environment, the Cecil County Department of Public Works, and the 
Chesapeake Haven Civic Association, Inc. (CHCA). Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Pro Se Complaint (defendant's Motion or 
Def.'s Mot.) 3, Exhibit (Ex.) A 1-2."
436,3," HN10[
] Section 6928(g) of title 42 of the United States Code also provides a civil penalty which is payable only to the United States (not to private individuals). See 42 U.S.C. § 6928(g) (2006) (""Any person who violates any requirement of this subchapter 
shall be liable to the United States for a civil penalty in an amount not to exceed $ 25,000 for each such violation.""). This portion 
of the statute is, therefore, not ""reasonably amenable"" to the reading that it mandates payment by the United States to a private 
individual. Intersport Fashions W., Inc. v. United States, 84 Fed. Cl. 454, 456 (2008) (stating that if the statute ""relied on by 
plaintiff as the basis of a claim is not reasonably amenable to being interpreted to constitute a money-mandating source, this 
court must dismiss the claim due to the lack of subject matter jurisdiction""); see infra Part III.D.2. "
437,4," The court also dismisses plaintiff's claims under § 4(b) of the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act (UFTA). Compl. 1. The UFTA 
has been adopted as state law in a variety of jurisdictions (in Maryland, it appears that the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act 
(UFCA), predecessor to the UFTA is still in place, see MD. Code Ann., [Com. Law] §§ 15-201-15-214), but the court is not 
aware of any federal UFTA as distinct from Section 548(a)(1) of Title 11 of the United States Code. See 11 U.S.C. § 548(a)(1) 
(2006). HN16[
] The Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1491, provides jurisdiction only over claims  [**17] arising under ""the Constitution, or any Act of Congress or any regulation of an executive department, or upon any express or implied contract with the United 
States . . . ."" 28 U.S.C. § 1491(a)(1) (2006). Because they are state laws, neither the UFTA nor the UFCA give rise to jurisdiction 
under the Tucker Act. "
438,5," Because plaintiff fails to renew her claims under Sections 8-10 of Article I, and Articles II and III in her Amended Response and 
fails to argue in either document submitted to the court which specific provisions of Articles II and III were violated and how they 
or Sections 8-10 of Article I might be construed as money mandating, the court treats the claims as abandoned and declines to 
reach the question of which, if any, of the provisions of Articles I-III are ""reasonably amenable"" to the reading that they are 
money mandating. "
439,6," Plaintiff's Complaint is divided into several sections. After the initial Complaint (ending in a signature page), there is a section 
entitled, ""See Case Next Section Opening Statement."" The Court refers to this section of the complaint as the Appendix (App.), 
as distinct from the exhibits  [**23] attached to the Complaint by plaintiff."
439,7," Plaintiff refers in her Complaint, Compl. App. P IV.A.8, to the ""Security Exchange Act, Rule 10 B-5 (insider trading),"" which the 
court assumes to be a reference to 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b5-1 and 10b5-2. "
445,1," ""Congress has deemed interstate highways critical to the national economy and has authorized extensive federal participation

segments of interstate roads."" Gulf Oil Corp. v. Copp Paving Co., Inc., 419 U.S. at 197-98, 95 S.Ct. at 400. "

452,1," The Honorable Christopher F. Droney, United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, sitting by designation. "
453,2," The contract states that WMC ""hereby engages [the private defendants] as an independent contractor to provide on an 
exclusive basis, except as provided otherwise herein with regard to Grandfathered Physicians, all Professional Services and 
Administrative Services in the Section [of Cardio-Thoracic Surgery of the Department of Surgery]""; it further states that the 
private defendants ""shall provide such number of Physicians . . . who, when considered in combination with Grandfathered 
Physicians, shall be sufficient to fully provide to the satisfaction of the Hospital all of the Services required by the Hospital."" A-72. 
In the section defining exceptions to the exclusivity provision, the contract states that ""[NYCG's] right to be the exclusive provider 
of cardio-thoracic services at the  [**4] Hospital . . . is subject to the following exceptions. During the term of this Agreement, (i) 
the surgeons listed below . . . (""Grandfathered Physicians"") shall be entitled to provide cardio-thoracic surgery services and 
device implementation . . . ."" A-89. "
454,3," The affirmative defenses contained in the defendants' first amended Answer include, inter alia, that the defendants' conduct 
does not lessen competition or create a monopoly. "
455,4," For example, the enabling statute notes with respect to medical projects (which are defined as ""any substantial durable 
apparatus, equipment, device or system . . . for the purpose of care, treatment, or diagnosis,"" N.Y. Pub. Auth. Law § 
3303(10)(g)(4)) that It is the intent of the legislature that overall cost should in all cases be a major criterion in the selection of project developers 
for award of contracts . . . and that, wherever  [**13] practical, such contracts should be entered into through competitive 
bidding procedures as prescribed by sections one hundred one and one hundred three of the general municipal law . . . . 
[I]n some instances it may be beneficial to the corporation to award a contract for a medical project on the basis of factors 
other than cost alone . . . . "
456,," N.Y. Pub. Auth. Law § 3303(9). Although not directly applicable to the WCHCC's agreement with the private defendants and 
other providers of medical services, this provision illustrates that the enabling statute's various provisions contemplated 
arrangements resulting from competitive bidding as well as other less competitive arrangements."
456,5," Because the district court has not yet determined whether WCHCC actively supervised the private defendants, we do not reach 
the question of whether WCHCC might derive liability from any unsupervised anticompetitive conduct on the part of the private 
defendants, a question we left unanswered in Electrical Inspectors. If the district court determines on remand that the private 
defendants were not actively supervised and that antitrust violations have occurred, it may have occasion to consider whether 
state action  [**14] immunity would allow a finding against WCHCC on this basis even though WCHCC's own actions were 
authorized by the state. Cf. Elec. Inspectors, 320 F.3d at 129."
456,6," An example of the alleged anticompetitive acts by the defendants is the allegation that Lansman used his position as Chief of 
the Section of Cardiothoracic Surgery to direct ""that the scheduling of access to the operating rooms, assignment of staff, and 
availability of equipment for heart and lung surgery at WMC be handled in a manner that gives preference to him and Spielvogel 
and causes maximum disadvantage to plaintiffs and their patients . . . . Lansman and Spielvogel have introduced practices for 
their convenience and advantage that have adversely affected the quality of patient well-being and care."" Complaint P 36. The 
complaint's additional allegations distinguish this  [**18] case from Cine 42nd St. Theater Corp. and Wheelabrator. In both those 
cases, the private parties were not accused of abusing their contracting status, but merely challenged for entering into the 
agreements. "
464,*," This opinion is SEALED until 5:00 p.m. Monday, July 6, 2009, to give the parties an opportunity to notify the Court, by sealed 
filings, whether any portion(s) need to be redacted because of confidentiality restrictions."
464,1," Defendants General Motors Corp. and Chrysler LLC (and its subsidiary Chrysler Motors LLC), filed for bankruptcy during the 
pendency of this case, and an automatic stay has issued. Notice of Bankruptcy: Chrysler LLC (Docket Item 1010); Notice of 
Bankruptcy: General Motors Corp. (Docket Item 1018). Accordingly, this decision is not applicable to those defendants. Their 
Canadian counterparts, however, are bound by this Order. See Letter from Joseph J. Tabacco, Jr., Counsel for Plaintiffs (June 
29, 2009) (Docket Item 1022); Statement of Non-Settling, Non-Bankrupt Defs. (Docket Item 1023) (Defendants, including 
General Motors of Canada, Ltd. and Chrysler Canada Inc.,  [**17] ""believe that the Court should decide all pending motions as 
to them, without regard to the bankruptcy filings of Chrysler LLC, Chrysler Motors LLC and General Motors Corporation"")."
464,2," The plaintiffs allege violations of state antitrust laws in Arizona, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nevada, New 
Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Tennessee, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. They allege violations of state 
consumer protection laws in Arkansas, Idaho, Maine, Massachusetts, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, West 
Virginia and Vermont. "
465,3," The plaintiffs point to policies such as manufacturers refusing to honor warranties on Canadian cars in the United States and 
discouraging dealers from installing odometers that measure miles rather than kilometers; mandating ""no export"" clauses in 
sales agreements between dealers and consumers and requiring Canadian dealers to conduct due diligence into whether 
potential customers were likely  [**22] to export their cars out of Canada; withholding information about safety recalls from 
exporting customers; imposing disciplinary measures on Canadian dealers who sold to exporting customers; imposing a 
""chargeback,"" a monetary penalty sometimes amounting to thousands of dollars, on the Canadian dealer who sold the car when 
a Canadian car was discovered in the United States; threatening to withhold inventory of desirable models from offending 
dealerships; and threatening to terminate dealerships that sold to exporters. The defendants say that all such policies were 
unilaterally adopted."

466,7," Because of my ruling on causation, I find it unnecessary to reach the issue of whether they have an adequate model to prove 
damages consumer by consumer."
466,8," Ford,  [**26] Chrysler and General Motors do not distinguish between their Canadian and U.S. entities on this argument, so 
neither do I. Chrysler also argues that the plaintiffs admit that as to a number of restraints, which were discussed at CADC meetings, no joint 
action was ever taken. Specifically, the Chrysler defendants point out that: the manufacturers never developed or used a uniform 
protocol due diligence list, nor did Chrysler share its list with other manufacturers, Chrysler Defs.' Statement of Material

466,9," An illegal agreement can be proven by direct evidence, or it can be proven by circumstantial evidence, often necessary 
because people frequently do not document or voice their illegal agreements. But if the evidence is only of parallel behavior, the 
Supreme Court adds additional proof requirements to survive summary judgment. ""To survive a motion for summary judgment . . 
. a plaintiff seeking damages for a violation of § 1 must present evidence ""that tends to exclude the possibility"" that the alleged 
conspirators acted independently."" Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 588, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. 
Ed. 2d 538 (1986)  [**28] (internal quotation omitted); accord Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 553-54, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 
167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007); In re Baby Food Antitrust Litig., 166 F.3d 112, 124 (3d Cir. 1999). Evidence of ""conduct [that is] as 
consistent with permissible competition as with illegal conspiracy does not, standing alone, support an inference of antitrust 
conspiracy."" Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 588; see also Williamson Oil Co. v. Philip Morris USA, 346 F.3d 1287, 1300 (11th Cir. "
467,2003," ) (""Evidence that does not support the existence of a price fixing conspiracy any more strongly than it supports conscious 
parallelism is insufficient to survive a defendant's summary judgment motion."")."
467,10," In deciding whether to grant the defendants' motion, I state the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs. The defendants 
urge me to conclude from the fact that the plaintiffs have chosen not to sue some manufacturers altogether or have dismissed 
other manufacturers from this action, that those manufacturers were innocent or that any restraints they had were merely 
unilateral or would not have been pursued absent an illegal horizontal agreement among others. The conclusion does not follow. 
There are other potential explanations  [**29] for such strategic choices by the plaintiffs. "
468,11," The parties treat the consumer protection claim as requiring the same elements, and so do I. See Pls.' Opp'n to Defs.' Mots. 
for Summ. J. [Corrected] at 61-62 (Docket Item 964) (superseding Docket Item 853) (""[P]laintiffs agree that the state antitrust 
and consumer protection laws of the . . . 19 states do not permit proof of injury by inference alone.""). The defendants also rely on 
federal law for their analysis and, although the plaintiffs deal with individual state laws, they do not reject the relevance or 
applicability of federal law cases. See Defs.' Joint Mot. for Summ. J. at 13  [**37] (Docket Item 961) (superseding Docket Item 
729) (""Under federal law . . . each plaintiff must still prove that [the antitrust violation occurred] and that it did in fact cause him 
injury. . . . Similarly, under the law of every state at issue here, indirect-purchaser plaintiffs also must show that each member of "
469,," the state classes suffered a legally cognizable injury."" (emphasis omitted)). I find it most straightforward to use the federal cases; 
the state cases for the remaining state law claims yield the same outcome."
469,12, The plaintiffs have not argued that they are entitled to change their strategy.
469,13," I recognize that the First Circuit made its statements about proof of impact while ruling on and vacating class certification, 
whereas I am ruling on summary judgment in the absence of  [**39] a certified class. (At oral argument, there was court-caused 
confusion on what motions were to be argue d. I agreed then to rule first on summary judgment before considering the renewed 
and fully-briefed class certification motion. Summ. J. Oral Argument Tr. 6:2-19, Mar. 6, 2009 (Docket Item 999).) Strictly 
speaking, therefore, I am ruling on only the individual claims of the named plaintiffs. But obviously with an eye to the law of the 
case on certification, the named plaintiffs have chosen not to produce individualized proof that their particular transaction prices 
were elevated by the conspiracy. See, e.g., POSMF PP 892-919; Pls.' First Supplemental Resps. to Defs.' General Motors Corp. 
and General Motors of Canada, Ltd.'s Am. First Set of Interrogs. # 6 (Ex. 744 to Decl. of Todd A. Seaver in Supp. of Pls.' Opp'n 
to Defs.' Mot. for Summ. J. (Docket Item 870)) (Docket Item 870-17). Presumably if they cannot get to a jury on class-wide 
evidence--i.e., evidence that will also support certification of a class--then pursuing the lawsuit for individual purchasers is not 
worth the candle because of the huge expense. Moreover, I must be faithful to the spirit of what the First Circuit said  [**40] that 
the plaintiffs must do. Therefore, my summary judgment ruling considers only the class-wide impact evidence, and that is how 
the parties have presented this summary judgment dispute to me. My conclusion, as elaborated in the text of the de cision, is 
that the plaintiffs' class-wide proof is not sufficient on its own to demonstrate impact on particular individual plaintiffs, here the 
named plaintiffs. But I do point out that my ruling, in the absence of class certification, disposes of the claims of only the named 
plaintiffs. Theoretically, other car-buyers could sue the manufacturers unaffected by the law or facts of this decision. Practically 
speaking, of course, that development is unlikely because the individual amounts at stake are generally very small compared to 
the cost of litigating, and there may also be statute of limitations problems for such claims. "
470,14," The First Circuit then went on to discuss  [**44] the so-called Bogosian shortcut, which I had discussed in my 2006 Order, In 
re New Motor Vehicles Canadian Exp. Antitrust Litig., 235 F.R.D. at 138 n.35, but observed that ""plaintiffs disclaim any intent to 
rely on the Bogosian model."" In re New Motor Vehicles Canadian Exp. Antitrust Litig., 522 F.3d 6, 29 (1st Cir. 2008). "
472,15," Professor Hall reached this conclusion by employing a standard econometric  [**50] technique known as a ""discrete choice 
model,"" and specifically the version of discrete choice modeling known as the ""nested-logit model."" Expert Report of Robert E. 
Hall on Impact & Class Damages P 91, May 10, 2007 (""Hall May 10, 2007 Report"") (Ex. 711 to Pls.' Opp'n to Defs.' Mots. for 
Summ. J.) (Docket Item 894-19)."
472,16," Even in their class certification motion, the plaintiffs claim only  [**53] that they can ""demonstrate that, by a preponderance of 
the evidence, the overwhelming majority of class members overpaid for their automobiles due to the inflated negotiating range,"" 
and that they can prove, ""with class-wide evidence, that there was widespread injury to class members"" Pls.' Renewed Mot. for 
Class Certification at 5 (Docket Item 964) (superseding Docket Item 898)."
472,17," The plaintiffs assert that the conspiracy elevated the retail or list prices and that these elevated prices moved the actual 
transaction prices. "
473,18," The  [**54] plaintiffs' expert Prof. Hall has testified that his methodology cannot establish injury to every consumer. See, e.g., 
Robert E. Hall Dep. 1082-83, Oct. 2, 2007 (Ex. 640 to Pls.' Opp'n to Defs.' Mots. for Summ. J.) (Docket Item 891-27) (admitting 
""I don't think I could say with confidence that everybody paid more""); id. at 1116-17 (admitting that his damages calculations 
would potentially include class members who were not overcharged); id. at 1118 (confirming that he was not contending that 
every single transaction price was affected by the alleged conspiracy); see also supra note 13. "
474,19," The NBER paper to which they refer is Meghan Busse, et al., $ 1,000 Cash Back: The Pass-Through of Auto Manufacturer 
Promotion, 96 Am. Econ. Rev. 1253 (2006)."
474,20," For example, the relative size of the importing and exporting countries is effectively reversed. In the U.S. experience, the 
importing market (the United States) is much larger than the exporting market (Canada). See Expert Report of Kevin M. Murphy 
P 180, Oct. 31, 2007 (""Murphy Oct. 31, 2007 Report"") (Ex. F to Defs.' Joint Mot. to Exclude Opinions & Testimony of Robert E. 
Hall (Docket Item 959) (superseding Docket Item 728)) (Docket Item 788-6). In addition, Dr. Hall concedes that the export 
restraint addressed in the Order--manufacturers discouraging  [**61] dealers from ordering new, authorized vehicles directly 
from dealers in other countries and selling them as new--would remain legal in the United States even in Dr. Hall's but-for world. 
Hall Dep. 1071-72, Oct. 2, 2007. Conversely, numerous practices that the plaintiffs challenge--such as manufacturers' use of 
chargebacks and warranty restrictions--were not addressed by the Order's parallel-trade provisions. See Robert E. Hall Dep. 
987-88, Oct. 1, 2007 (Ex. 639 to Pls.' Opp'n to Defs.' Mots. for Summ. J.) (Docket Item 891-26). Finally, the defendants' expert 
points out that regional price incentives to address localized price pressures are ever-present in the United States market. 
Murphy Oct. 31, 2007 Report P 247. There are no analogous type of price incentives used in the United Kingdom. Id. Thus, it is 
problematic whether a nationwide price change in the United Kingdom says anything about whether there would be a nationwide 
price change in the United States--a much larger and geographically varied nation. "
475,21," Among the reasons that inference alone is not enough, is the fact that car purchases generally  [**64] are a product of 
individual negotiation and can often involve other issues such as trade-in allowances, below-market-rate financing, etc."
475,22," I am not sure whether the plaintiffs mean to argue that these First Circuit statements unfairly shift the burden of proof. See 
Pls.' Opp'n to Defs.' Mots. for Summ. J. 70-71 (opposing the argument that because it is possible that a given class member 
would have paid the same price they fail on their causation claim). The plaintiffs object to the defendants' suggestion that the 
plaintiffs' burden is to ""rule out the possibility"" that a plaintiff could have paid the same price in the but-for world. See Defs.' Joint 
Mot. for Summ. J. at 25 n.30. In any event, I follow the First Circuit statements and I do not believe that they shift the burden of 
proof, but only describe what the plaintiffs must do, given the method of proof they have chosen for this putative class action."
475,23," Leffel has been Nissan USA's Director of Pricing Strategy since April 2003, and before that Leffel worked in Nissan's Pricing 
Department. The Leffel declaration recounts an instance relating to model year 2005 in which GM advertised an ""employee 
pricing"" incentive and cut U.S. prices. POSMF P 886 (citing Decl. of Duane A. Leffel P 16, Mar. 19, 2008 (Ex. 726 to Pls.' Opp'n 
to Defs.' Mots. for Summ. J.) (Docket Item 894-31)). Leffel explained that Ford and Chrysler followed,  [**67] and ""transaction 
prices . . . for all of the models for [the] three competitors"" were reduced. Leffel Decl. P 16. This sworn statement, the plaintiffs 
assert, together with the NBER paper's empirical study, makes it more likely than not that the elevated MSRPs during the class 
period were passed through to the transaction prices paid for all plaintiffs' purchases. In the same statement, however, Leffel 
makes it clear that in response to the employee pricing incentives employed by other manufacturers ""Nissan USA offered some 
incentives on some models, but on all others it made no changes in price or incentives."" Id. "
476,24," ""[A] minimal increase in national pricing would not necessarily mean that all consumers would pay more. Too many factors 
play into an individual negotiation to allow an assumption--at least without further theoretical development--that any price 
increase or decrease will always have the same magnitude of effect on the final price paid."" In re New Motor Vehicles Canadian 
Exp. Antitrust Litig., 522 F.3d at 29."
476,25," ""From an economist's perspective, these two types of promotions provide an interesting comparison. While the promotion 
payments are nominally directed to one party or the other, who ultimately receives the benefit of the promotion depends on the 
outcome of the price negotiation process."" Busse, et al., supra note 19, at 1253."
476,26," Ordinarily  [**70] on summary judgment I would not deal with assertions like these that are not part of a statement of material 
facts but are filed instead in a brief on a different motion. However, the defendants' lawyer referred to them at oral argument. "
477,27," Hall states: ""I estimate the effect of the New Cars Order on list prices, not consumer transaction prices."" Prof. Hall's Resp. to 
Defs.' Rebuttal Reports P 228, Feb. 3, 2008 (Ex. 77 to Decl. of Daniel Purcell in Supp. of Honda's Mot. for Summ. J. (Docket 
Item 763)) (Docket Items 817-77 through 817-79)."
477,28," Professor Hall also addresses ""Common Impact"" in paragraphs 299-307 of his February 3, 2008 Report, but those paragraphs 
are all addressed to his rejection of defense expert Professor Murphy's criticisms, not any new analysis or evidence to support 
Professor Hall's position. "
478,29," That statement also dooms the plaintiffs' argument that the NBER study shows that ""there is a low likelihood of many 
transactions occurring without pass-through,"" or that price changes ""are passed through at extremely high rates."" Pls.' Opp'n to

(June 13, 2007, Vol. 2 at 27:25-28:18, 29:23-30:3), Michaels testified that he  [*34] used EIMs for each plaintiff even though

513,1," Because the motions before the Court seek dismissal pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b), Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) and Fed. R. Civ. 
P. 12(b)(6), only those facts relevant to determining the motions are recounted herein."
513,2," The proposed class of health and welfare funds, third party payors (""TPPs"") and consumers is represented by nine named 
plaintiffs: International Brotherhood of Teamsters Local No. 331 Health & Welfare Trust Fund, Heavy and General Laborers' 
Local Union 472/172 Welfare Fund, United American Insurance Company, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Alabama, Angela F. 
Montgomery, Harold Estelle, Beryl A'dare Bratton and Dorothy Bratton, and John Hutson, as putative personal representative of 
the Estate of John C. Hutson (collectively ""Plaintiffs"")."
513,3," Plaintiffs seek to represent a proposed Class of health and welfare funds, TPPs and individual consumers ""who have paid any 
portion of the purchase price  [*8] for Intron Franchise Drugs [], and/or Temodar, Eulexin, Integrillin, and Fareston…."" (Complaint 
PP 1, 269.) Yet, the allegations contained in the Complaint are limited to the off-label promotion and marketing of Temodar and 
the Intron Franchise Drugs. Plaintiffs make only passing references to Eulexin, Fareston and Integrillin. Therefore, the Court "
514,," construes Plaintiffs' claims as if they are limited solely to the off-label promotion and marketing of Temodar and the Intron 
Franchise Drugs. "
515,4," Under the Social Security Act, Medicare is required to cover all prescriptions for ""any drugs or biologicals used in an anticancer 
chemotherapeutic regimen for a medically accepted indication."" 42 U.S.C. § 1395x(t)(2)(A). The Act defines a ""medically 
accepted indication"" as an FDA-approved use, as well a use for which the drug has not been approved by the FDA but which is 
""supported by one or more citations which are included (or approved for inclusion) in one or more of the following compendia: 
the American Hospital Formulary Service-Drug Information, the American Medical Association Drug Evaluations, the United 
States Pharmacopoeia-Drug Information (or its successor publications), and other authoritative compendia as identified by the

which the Court held that state law failure-to-warn claims asserted against a pharmaceutical manufacturer are not preempted by 
federal law, Defendants no longer contend that Plaintiffs' state law claims are preempted. (Letter from Plaintiffs' Counsel to the 
Court dated March 13, 2009; Docket Entry No. 192.) "
519,6," HN9[
] In order to have standing, a plaintiff must first demonstrate with particularity that he has suffered a concrete injury-in-
fact. Interfaith Cmty. Org. v. Honeywell Int'l, 399 F.3d 248, 254 (3d Cir. 2005). To determine injury-in-fact, a court will ""consider[] 
whether the alleged injury falls within the 'zone of interests' that the statute or constitutional provision at issue was designed to 
protect[.]"" Anjelino v. New York Times Co., 200 F.3d 73, 88 (3d Cir. 1999). Because a court's injury-in-fact analysis is influenced 
by the statutory, constitutional or common law interests  [*28] sought to be protected, the Court will consider whether Plaintiffs 
have adequately alleged injury-in-fact as part of its analysis of each of Plaintiffs' nine claims."
519,7," HN13[
] The RICO statute's provision of a civil remedy was enacted to ""turn [plaintiffs] into prosecutors, 'private attorneys 
general,' dedicated to eliminating racketeering activity…."" Prudential Ins. Co. of America v. U.S. Gypsum Co., 359 F.3d 226, 236 
(3d Cir. 2004) (quoting Rotella v. Wood, 528 U.S. 549, 550, 120 S. Ct. 1075, 145 L. Ed. 2d 1047 (2000)). "
521,8," It is clear that HN15[
] the Court  [*37] may consider statements made by counsel at oral argument to clarify allegations made 
in the Complaint. See Maio, 221 F.3d at 485 n.12 (citing Alicke v. MCI Communications Corp., 111 F.3d 909, 911, 324 U.S. App. 
D.C. 150 (D.C. Cir. 1997)). "
527,9," In McLaughlin, the Second Circuit did not go so far as to bar plaintiffs from ever asserting RICO claims for injury to expectancy 
interests, but it foreclosed RICO plaintiffs from claiming injury to expectancy interests in cases like the instant action which 
sound in fraud in the inducement. Id. at 228-29."
527,10," Likewise, the court in Zyprexa concluded that plaintiffs had adequately pled that Eli Lilly promoted Zyprexa as safer and more 
effective than alternatives when, in fact, the manufacturer knew this to be untrue. Zyprexa, 493 F.Supp.2d at 577-78. "
528,11," The court in Bextra discounted the distinction between misrepresentations aimed at plaintiffs and those directed at prescribing 
physicians in determining that plaintiffs had adequately pled injury in fact. 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 49717, 2007 WL 2028408, at 
*6. Yet, in In re Rezulin, 524 F. Supp. 2d 436 (S.D.N.Y. 2007), the court held that Desiano ""has no bearing"" in a case where, as 
here, ""plaintiffs allege that they were injured because patients and the medical community were misled."" Id. at 442. 
Notwithstanding Bextra, the Rezulin court's reading of Desiano's clear language is more sensible."
528,12," See discussion of ""Effectiveness of the Subject Drugs,"" supra., at 20-31. "
529,13," As an alternative rationale for dismissing Plaintiffs' claims, Schering suggests that Plaintiffs receipt of some value for their drug 
purchases forestalls their allegations of injury. (Schering Br. at 14.) The Court is not persuaded by this argument. In short, 
receipt of value cannot have the talismanic effect of insulating defendants absolutely from liability, especially where the value 
received may be negligible compared to the amount paid for the drugs in question. Instead, the holding in Janssen that injury 
may be pled by alleging that ""[a] drug was inferior on some level and worth less than what  [*70] [plaintiffs] paid for it[]"" is apt."
529,14," Plaintiffs allege that individual Plaintiffs Estelle and Hutson and the Bratton Plaintiffs purchased and consumed Eulexin to treat 
prostate cancer. (See Complaint PP 17-19.) The Court has previously determined that the class of drugs at issue in this action is 
limited to the Intron Franchise Drugs and Temodar. See Note 3, supra."
529,15," Plaintiffs seem to suggest that the Court should assume that TPPs could and would have purchased cheaper alternatives to 
treat all indications for which the Subject Drugs were prescribed and purchased off-label. Without question, when reviewing a 
motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), the Court must ""accept all factual allegations in the complaint as true and give the 
pleader the benefit of all reasonable inferences that can be fairly  [*73] drawn therefrom."" Kost v. Kozakiewicz, 1 F.3d 176, 183 
(3d Cir.1993). But because the Complaint is entirely lacking in allegations that there actually were cheaper, equally effective 
alternative drugs for the off-label indications for which Temodar and the Intron Franchise Drugs were prescribed, the Court will 
not fill the void by inferring the existence of cheaper alternatives for a variety of medical conditions based on little more than 
generalized allegations. "
531,16," Plaintiffs' fourth theory of RICO injury is also untenable because Plaintiffs do not differentiate among individual plaintiffs and 
beneficiaries who received a safe and effective treatment from the Subject Drugs and those who allegedly did not. Therefore, 
their theory of price inflation would permit any purchaser of the Subject Drugs, even those who miraculously recovered from their 
medical conditions as a result of treatment with the Subject Drugs, to plead injury to their business or property under RICO. "
533,17," Notably, the Second Circuit in Desiano analyzed proximate cause under New Jersey law rather than federal law. The Court 
noted that it was ""very much inclined to agree with Plaintiffs"" that HN32[
] ""the law of New Jersey on proximate cause does not 
have the relatively narrow directness requirements applied  [*88] by the federal courts under RICO…."" Desiano, 326 F.3d at 
349. "
535,18," See discussion of ""Effectiveness of the Subject Drugs,"" supra., at 20-31."
535,19," Generally, the Court will not dismiss a claim for failure to comply with Rule 9(b) where the facts underlying the alleged mail 
and wire fraud not pled with particularity are those within defendants' exclusive possession. See Craftmatic Secs. Litig. v. 
Kraftsow, 890 F.2d 628, 645 (3d Cir. 1989). However, Plaintiffs do not aver that the facts required to make out claims for mail 
and wire fraud are exclusively within the control of the Defendants. Indeed, it appears that some of the missing facts would be 
within the control of pharmacy benefit managers and the prescribing physicians. Nonetheless, even if the facts were within the 
exclusive control of Defendants, Plaintiffs must still describe the efforts they have made to obtain information from the 
Defendants or third parties. See Zavala v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 393 F. Supp. 2d 295, 314 (D.N.J. 2005)HN36[
] (""Even 
 [*97] under a more lenient application of Rule 9 . . . the complaint should set forth the nature and scope of plaintiffs' efforts to 
obtain, before filing the complaint, the information needed to plead with particularity."")(internal citations omitted). They make no 
such showing. "
537,20," Plaintiffs suggest that, contrary to the federal RICO statute, a corporate defendant  [*104] need not be distinct from the alleged 
enterprise under the New Jersey RICO statute. (Pl. Br. at 18 n. 16.) Yet, there appears to be at least some disagreement among 
New Jersey courts regarding whether a defendant may also be an enterprise under the statute. Compare Maxim Sewerage v. 
Monmouth Ridings, 273 N.J. Super. 84, 95-96, 640 A.2d 1216 (Law Div. 1993) (no distinctiveness required between person and 
enterprise) with State v. Kuklinski, 234 N.J. Super. 418, 421-22, 560 A.2d 1295 (Law Div. 1988) (terms ""employed by and 
""associated with"" contemplate a person distinct from the enterprise). Because the Court ultimately dismisses Plaintiffs NJ RICO 
claims for failure to adequately plead injury and causation, the Court will not predict whether the New Jersey Supreme Court 
would hold that a corporate defendant could be both the ""person"" and the ""enterprise"" under the NJ RICO statute. "
538,21," Plaintiffs refer to the CTC program as being managed by a third party entity, Documedics, which was allegedly controlled by 
Schering. However, the preponderance of the allegations regarding the program describe a relationship between Schering and 
the CTC program, not Documedics. Therefore, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have actually pled an association-in-fact 
enterprise comprised of Schering and the CTC program."
538,22," The Court reaches the same result taking into account the NJ RICO statute's broader definition of enterprise. See N.J.S.A. 
2C:41-1(c)."
538,23," The Court is unpersuaded by Plaintiffs' attempts to distinguish the proofs offered by plaintiffs in Merck from those which they 
propose here. Plaintiffs contend that they will establish cognizable injury by ""rely[ing] on several experts and on [Schering's] own 
internal marketing documents."" (Pl. Br. at 9.) In Merck, plaintiffs sought to prove causation and ascertainable loss through the 
presentation of expert testimony demonstrating that the price of Vioxx was inflated as a result of the marketing conduct at issue. 
There appears to be no difference between what plaintiffs in Merck sought to prove and what Plaintiffs allege in this case. 
 [*112] In short, it is not the nature of the proofs, it is the theory being espoused that is definitive. Here, Plaintiffs could offer the "
539,," testimony of not one but ten experts, all of whom conclude that Schering's marketing activities inflated the price of the Subject 
Drugs. But so long as Plaintiffs offer aggregate proof of ascertainable loss and causation in lieu of specific facts establishing a 
connection between Plaintiffs' purported injury and Schering's alleged misconduct, their NJCFA claims will be dismissed."
539,24," HN48[
] It is the obligation of this Court to apply New Jersey law as established by the State's highest court, where the court 
has spoken. The New Jersey Supreme Court flagged the issue of whether TPPs could sue under the NJCFA in Merck, but 
expressly declined to decide the issue. 192 N.J. at 377 n.1. In the absence of a definitive statement of the law by the Supreme 
Court, this Court is required to predict how that court would rule if presented with an issue. The Court follows, and indeed is 
bound by, the Third Circuit's prediction of New Jersey law in California Smoothie. However, the Court notes that a subsequent 
decision of the New Jersey Appellate Division in Kavky v. Herbalife Int'l of America, 359 N.J. Super. 497, 501-03, 820 A.2d 677 
(App. Div. 2003) expressly rejects the Third Circuit's rationale for determining the scope of the NJCFA. "

544,2," This Court adopts the version of events set forth by Appellants because it is well-established that when considering  [*3] a

565,133," There were also material flaws in Michael's damage analysis. Among other things, to reach a damages figure based on 
plaintiffs' alleged lost sales, Michaels multiplied plaintiffs' alleged total lost gallons by the ""estimated industry margin"" (""EIM"") 
(June 13, 2007, Vol. 2 at 27:25-28:18, 29:23-30:3), Michaels testified that he  [*34] used EIMs for each plaintiff even though 
those margins are not necessarily the actual margins the dealers were making."" (June 13, 2007, Vol. 2 at 28:19-25.) He also 
used the same margin for each plaintiff for the entire damages period (June 13, 2007, Vol. 2 at 29:1-10), even though plaintiffs 
uniformly testified that their margins fluctuate over time. (June 7, 2007, Vol. 2 at 79:7-80:3 (Ashkan's margins fluctuate); June 6, 
2007, Vol. 2 at 44:18-45:8 (Wong's margins fluctuate); June 7, 2007, Vol. 2 at 44:6-24, 45:25-46:9 (Alborz's margins fluctuate);

(Saban's margins fluctuate); June 6, 2007, Vol. 1 at 52:24-53:2, 56:6-20, 82:8-15 (Madani's margins fluctuate).) The Court finds 
that Michaels' use of the EIM renders his conclusions that plaintiffs were damaged inaccurate."

571,181," Plaintiffs' Proposed Conclusions of Law, P 3. "
575,1," Plaintiffs' first Motion for Class Certification was docketed as Doc. 428. Plaintiffs subsequently filed an Amended Motion for 
Class Certification, Doc. 437. Finally, after portions of the Amended Motion were sealed, at the direction of the Court, Plaintiffs 
refiled a corrected and redacted version of the Motion, along with Exhibit 1 to the Motion, as  [*8] Doc. 507. This Order will 
resolve these three pending Motions. "
577,2," The Court concludes that the requirement of numerosity is met, even taking into consideration only the per diem nurses (and 
not the traveling nurses), as discussed infra. "
578,3," It is not clear from the deposition excerpt if Ms. Johnson was referring to the Department of Justice complaint or the Complaint 
filed in the instant case, but for the purposes of equitable tolling, it is immaterial, as both date from 2007. "
581,4," The reasoning explained below also applies to Plaintiffs' claims for unjust enrichment. To recover on a theory of unjust 
enrichment, ""a party must show: (1) an enrichment; (2) an impoverishment; (3) a connection between the enrichment and the 
impoverishment; (4) the absence of justification for the enrichment and the impoverishment; and (5) the absence of a legal 
remedy."" Trustmark Ins. Co. v. Bank One, Ariz., NA, 202 Ariz. 535, 48 P.3d 485, 491 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2002) (citing City of Sierra 
Vista v. Cochise Enters., Inc., 144 Ariz. 375, 697 P.2d 1125, 1131 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1984)). To satisfy the impoverishment prong, 
Plaintiffs will need to prove basically the same set of facts required for antitrust impact. Accordingly, the Court will analyze the 
parties' arguments with respect to the antitrust claims, but they apply equally to the claims for unjust enrichment contained in the 
Complaint. "
582,5," It also appears that some per diem nurses negotiate their own pay rates, although the practice seems to be less common. (See 
Defs.' Resp., Ex. H, Decl. of Elizabeth Clements P 4; Ex. J, Decl. of Jon Jolls P 4; but see Ex. K, Decl. of Brett Tolich P 7 (""All 
[per diem] nurses are hired at the same rate.""); and Ex. N, Decl. of Lucy Chinwe P 7 (""[E]ach individual nurse receives the same 
rate for each assignment, regardless of our bill rate to any particular hospital at which the nurse may work."").) Also, even when 
there are negotiations in the per diem  [*33] context, per diem nurses only negotiate their rate, whereas traveling nurses 
frequently negotiate each provision of the travel assignment. "
583,6," Dr. Singer's Report includes a graph of these figures, which unfortunately was not provided to the Court in color, rendering it 
less useful. The Court is able to discern the significance of the example without the graph, though. "

593,5," In Queen City Pizza, the Third Circuit considered the antitrust violations alleged by Domino's Pizza franchisees against the 
parent corporation. The plaintiffs described the relevant product market as the ""ingredient, supplies, materials, and distribution 
services used by and in the operation of Domino's pizza stores."" 124 F.3d at 437. The Third Circuit rejected this definition for 
failure to include all reasonably interchangeable products. Id. at 438. The court stated the analysis was not limited ""to the 
contractual  [**14] restraints assumed by a particular plaintiff . . . but to the uses to which the product is put by consumers in 
general."" Id. Applied to those facts, the Third Circuit believed the focus had to be on pizza makers as a whole and the functional 
interchangeability between Domino's and non-Domino's products. Id. Unlike the facts in Queen City Pizza, the complaint 
(through the patents) states that no other reasonable products exist for these applications. "
594,6," Carpenter argues that ATI has ""impl[ied] that no non-infringing method of product [sic] exists"" (id.), but even when drawing all 
reasonable inferences in Carpenter's favor, I do not read any such innuendo from ATI's motion to dismiss or its letters to 
Carpenter. They state only that ATI holds a patent ""cover[ing]  [**16] the manufacture, use, and sale of [large diameter triple-
melted 718 nickel alloy ingots greater than 30 inches in diameter, including up to 36 inches in diameter."" While this certainly 
would raise questions regarding Alloy 718 itself, my reading does not find the implication or insinuation that no other process of 
production exists. I also note the complaint fails to state or suggest any facts relating to the existence (or non- existence) of non-infringing methods 
of production. With no allegations from Carpenter on the matter, the court is simply left to guess whether other methods exist. "

] Adopting the Supreme Court's reasoning in commercial speech cases, the Third Circuit identified three factors to

596,9," The primary case ATI has cited is ISI International, Inc. v. Borden Ladner Gervais LLP, 316 F.3d 731 (7th Cir. 2003). In this 
case, the Seventh Circuit stated that letters to customers do not come within the scope of the Lanham Act. Id. at 733. I decline to 
adopt this reasoning as the interpretation is only persuasive authority, not controlling. While the Seventh Circuit has established 
this rule of law, no other circuits appear to have taken adopted  [**26] a similar line of reasoning to create a per se rule as to 
when letters to consumers can be the basis of a Lanham Act claim. Given the current procedural posture and applicable 
standard of review, I will allow the claim to proceed to discovery so that more facts regarding ATI's intent and the scope of 
distribution can be ascertained. "

605,7," Square D involved an alleged horizontal price-fixing conspiracy perpetrated by the defendants through a nonprofit tariff bureau

106 S. Ct. 1922, 90 L. Ed. 2d 413. The Supreme Court held that the filed rate doctrine still precluded recovery of treble damages 
under the Sherman Act. "
626,1, Jurisdiction is exercised under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 because the claims arise under federal law.
626,2," Several  [**23] internet retailers sued in Babyage.com, et al. v. Toys ""R"" Us, Inc., et al., No. 05-6792 (E.D. Pa. filed Dec. 29,

627,3," The facts  [**26] are stated based on evidence offered to support the Fourth Amended Consolidated Class Action Complaint 
(""Complaint"")."
627,4," The three defendants Toys ""R"" Us - Delaware, Inc.; Toys ""R"" Us, Inc., doing business as Babies ""R"" Us; and BRU are 
collectively called ""BRU"" in this opinion. "
628,5, BRU proposed almost identical policies to other defendants. 
632,6," For example, because the parties agree that strollers, car seats, and high chairs have separate markets, many questions 
related to antitrust economics (e.g., whether a conspiracy harmed competition) would require different evidence for different 
subclass members, precluding certification under Rule 23(b)(3). "
635,7," They also allege the unique defenses considered above, but my conclusions are the same. See Beck, 457 F.3d 291 at 296 
(HN16[
] ""[U]nique defenses bear on both the typicality and adequacy of a class representative.""). "
636,8," In the many hundreds of pages written against class certification in this case, only two paragraphs concern superiority. (See 
Regal Lager's Sep. Surreply 25-26.) Regal Lager contended that superiority cannot be  [**58] satisfied because of alleged 
issues affecting only individual subclass members and each consumer's small potential recovery. Regal Lager seemingly 
abandoned these arguments later, however, because the defendants do not contest superiority in their proposed findings."
636,9," Although I may have expressed some doubts about this earlier in the litigation (Doc. # # 565 and 567), I find that Newton and In 
re Hydrogen Peroxide make this point clear. "
637,10," The defendants have argued that the allegations cannot be proved with persuasive evidence, but they have given no reason 
why individual evidence might be required. "
639,11," The defendants argue that the alleged relevant markets cannot be proved with common evidence because subclass members 
attach different meanings to the term ""high-end."" (Hr'g Tr. 128, May 28, 2009 ["" 5/28 Hr'g Tr.""].) However, HN30[
] defining 
relevant markets requires economic analysis of general consumer behavior--i.e., whether products are reasonably 
interchangeable or have  [**69] cross-elasticity of demand--that would certainly be common to each subclass. See Tunis Bros. 
Co., Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 952 F.2d 715, 722 (3d Cir. 1991) (explaining how economists determine relevant markets)."
639,12," HN32[
] Higher consumer prices because of an antitrust violation obviously constitute antitrust injury. See Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U.S. 330, 339, 99 S. Ct. 2326, 60 L. Ed. 2d 931 (1979) (""A consumer whose money has been diminished by reason 
of an antitrust violation has been injured 'in his … property' within the meaning of § 4.""); In re New Motor Vehicles Canadian Exp. 
Antitrust Litig., 522 F.3d 6, 13 (1st Cir. 2008) (""There is no doubt that the types of injuries alleged here--consumers paying 
artificially inflated prices due to antitrust violations--are antitrust injuries.""). "
640,13," For the purpose of this opinion, ""supra-competitive  [**72] prices"" means prices higher than ""the prices which would obtain in a 
competitive regime."" In re Linerboard, 305 F.3d at 151."
640,14," ""Online shopping and research have not only made price comparison easy, they have also changed the way people shop. 
Even consumers who do not buy online often look online before going to a storefront to purchase products. As a result, they are 
better informed about product features and reasonable pricing when going to the store."" Note, Leegin's Unexplored ""Change in 
Circumstances"": the Internet and Resale Price Maintenance, 121 Harv. L. Rev. 1600, 1614 (2008). "
641,15," Myslinski also noted reasons why BRU might charge MSRP while internet retailers discounted. (Myslinski Rep. III P 19.) But 
his theories do not overcome the persuasive evidence to the contrary. "
642,16," The defendants assert that Comanor conceded that a consumer who purchased during a sale might not have been impacted. 
(Def.'s Prop'd Findings P 57.) But the deposition testimony that they cite concerns a consumer who purchased from an internet 
retailer, not one who purchased from BRU. (Comanor Dep. 204:8-21.) "
643,17," Comanor also conducted regression analyses to prove this point, but I find the deposition testimony and other  [**86] evidence 
adequate. "
644,18," Britax also stated that ""[t]he introduction of a Price Policy has achieved retail pricing stability and protected BCS [Britax] from a 
loss of distribution. However, Roundabout sales have fallen 5% since retail discounting was prohibited."" (Pl.'s Ex. 128.) "
645,19, Myslinski conceded that benchmark analyses are accepted in antitrust economics. (Myslinski Dep. 383:10-22.)
645,20," Comanor also proposed using Amazon.com, Inc. (""Amazon""), the largest internet retailer. This benchmark is inadequate 
because Amazon does not maintain brick-and-mortar stores. "
646,1," During the telephone conference on May 13,  [**96] 2009, counsel for the plaintiffs stated that they are no longer pursuing 
claims under § 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1-7 (2009). "
651,1," ""Hybrid"" restraints on trade are governmentally-imposed trade restraints that enforce private pricing decisions. ""Unilateral"" 
restraints on trade are those that are unilaterally imposed by the government. See TFWS, Inc. v. Schaefer (""TFWS I"") 242 F.3d 
198, 207-08 (4th Cir. 2001)."
651,2," A ""per se"" violation occurs when a state regulatory scheme is irreconcilable on its face with § 1 of the Sherman Act. See id., at

651,3," Maryland, however, had not yet raised any 21st Amendment defense."
651,4," Section Two of the Twenty-First Amendment provides, ""The transportation or importation into any State, Territory, or 
possession of the United States for delivery or use therein of intoxicating liquors, in violation of the laws thereof, is hereby "

and distribution of alcoholic beverages within their borders. See North Dakota v. United States, 495 U.S. 423, 431, 110 S. Ct. 
1986, 109 L. Ed. 2d 420 (1990)."
652,5," With the post-and-hold pricing system, we recognized a plain distinction between the lawful right to publish prices, on the one

653,9," Maryland's analysis seems to draw a parallel between Leegin and our holding in TFWS I on the basis of the shared term 
""resale price maintenance."" See Appellant's Br. at 28-29. In Leegin, the Supreme Court used the term ""resale price 
maintenance"" to describe vertical price fixing that the Court held was to be evaluated according to the ""rule of reason"" and was "
654,," no longer per se illegal. However, in TFWS I, we used the same term merely to describe a commonality between three Supreme 
Court decisions, Schwegmann, Midcal, and 324 Liquor, and not to describe the Maryland regulatory scheme. See TFWS I, 242 
F.3d at 208 (""All three of these cases, Schwegmann, Midcal, and 324 Liquor, dealt with the liquor or wine industry and some 
form of state-sanctioned resale price maintenance.""). Further, at the  [**13] point in our analysis in TFWS I where we relied on 
these Supreme Court decisions, we were analyzing whether Maryland's regulatory scheme was a hybrid restraint on trade and 
not whether this scheme was a per se violation of the Sherman Act -- the topic of interest in Leegin. See id. at 208 (noting that 
Schwegmann, Midcal, and 324 Liquor ""[e]ach involved state liquor or wine laws that empowered private parties to set prices, and 
those prices were enforced by government mechanisms.""). We based our conclusion that the scheme is a per se violation 
explicitly on our finding that Maryland's scheme constituted horizontal price fixing. See id. at 209."
654,10," But see Costco Wholesale Corp. v. Maleng, 522 F.3d 874 (9th Cir. 2008), in which the Ninth Circuit came to a different 
conclusion in reviewing Washington law. The Ninth Circuit struck down Washington's ""post-and-hold"" pricing system (which it 
found to be a per se violation of the Sherman Act), but severed and upheld Washington's ""volume discount ban"" as a unilateral 
restraint on trade. Id. at 898-900."
654,11," Maryland failed to even raise  [**16] this concern until its third appeal to this court--years after our initial decision in TFWS I 
and years after Maryland itself had staked a position essentially identical to our holding in TFWS I on this issue. "
657,12," TFWS also points out, and the state does not dispute, that Maryland has not raised its excise tax on liquor for more than fifty 
years. See Appellee's Br. at 5, 42. Maryland has consistently rejected bills that would raise its excise taxes. See J.A. 5091-127 
(collecting bills proposing to raise the excise tax that failed to make it through the legislature). Maryland, along with the District of 
Columbia, imposes the lowest excise tax in the nation on distilled spirits and a tax rate on wine that is well below the national 
median. J.A. 5134."
657,13," For instance, Maryland submitted data that was not representative of each state and which did not consistently survey the 
same retailers. J.A. 5660-61. Further, the state did not even provide  [**28] any new analysis of its original data to control for the 
effect of excise taxes. J.A. 5661. Finally, although Maryland's approach did not allow for any discount via bridge buying in 
Maryland, it applied quantity discount to all Delaware prices, even though not all Delaware retailers are able to take advantage of 
these discounts. J.A. 5662. This flawed approach skewed Maryland's prices upward and Delaware's prices downward. "
663,1," In February of 2005, the case was removed to the United States District Court for the District of Maine, and then to a 
multidistrict litigation panel. It was remanded back to the Superior Court in September of 2005."
663,2," Although McKinnon makes reference to numerous facts found by the federal court in his statement of material facts, he does 
not cite to record evidence in the present case. Before the trial court, Honeywell disputed these facts as not properly before the 
court. Honeywell also contends that in this limited motion for a summary judgment, even assuming that the facts from the federal 
case are true, summary judgment is still appropriate."
663,3," On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the denial of injunctive relief to Honeywell, but 
expressed no opinion as to whether Honeywell misled the Patent and Trademark Office in its trademark application. Eco Mfg. 
LLC v. Honeywell Int'l, Inc., 357 F.3d 649, 655 (7th Cir. 2003). The case was subsequently settled. "
665,4," Title 14 M.R.S. § 3580 (2008) regards fraudulent transfers, and does not apply here."
665,5," Honeywell's 1968 trademark application was denied. Its 1986 trademark application was approved in 1988. In the 1986 
application proceedings, allegations were made that Honeywell made threats to competitors."
665,6," New Hampshire law permits the filing of indirect purchaser actions like that of McKinnon pursuant to New Hampshire's 
Consumer Protection Act, N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 358-A:1 to :13 (1995 & Supp. 2006). Lachance v. U.S. Smokeless Tabacco 
Co., 156 N.H. 88, 931 A.2d 571, 575-81 (N.H. 2007). "
668,7," There is one distinction worth noting, although it does not affect this appeal: M.R. Civ. P. 23(c)(1) permits conditional orders of 
class  [***23] certification, whereas Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c) was revised to remove this option. Brown v. Am. Honda (In re New 
Motor Vehicles Canadian Exp. Antitrust Litig.), 522 F.3d 6, 26 & n.27 (1st Cir. 2008). "
671,1, Plaintiff also brings a claim for declaratory relief.
671,2," Although this is alleged in the complaint, Plaintiff has provided no evidence of it in its declarations."
671,3," Defendants assert that Westside has not used the Westside Name consistently, but continues to use many names including 
Good Shepherd Rescue, Westside German Shepherd Rescue, German Shepherd Rescue and Adoptions of Southern 
California, Inc., Westside German Shepherd Rescue and Adoptions, Inc., Westside German Shepherd Rescue of Los Angeles, 
and German Shepherd Rescue of Los Angeles, Inc., or no name at all. Opposition at 4, Pollock Decl. at ¶¶ 6, 9. Plaintiff objects 
to this declaration on the grounds that it lacks foundation and personal knowledge. Plaintiff's Evidentiary Objections 
(""Objections"") at 3. "
672,4," This board member, Lisa Ann Sparks, resigned after discovering that Pollock was not actually with Westside. Sparks Decl. at 
¶¶ 4-5."
672,5, Westside receives thousands of dollars in donations through the mail. Robin Jampol at ¶ 19. 
673,6, See subsection la. infra p. 5-6.
673,7," The standard previously followed required only a ""possibility"" of irreparable injury but the Court in Winter held that the 
possibility standard was too lenient, insisting instead on a ""likelihood "" standard. 129 S.Ct. at 375. "
675,8," See Plaintiff's Memorandum at 17-20. Defendants raise this contention in their opposition, Opposition at 2, and Plaintiff does 
not attempt to counter it in its reply."
675,9," Plaintiff's infringement claim is brought pursuant to section 1125(a) because the Westside Name is not registered. See 
Rrookfield Communs. Inc. v West Coast Entm't Corp., 174 F.3d 1036, 1047 n.8 (9th Cir. 1999)."
675,10," One leading practice guide in the area describes section 1125(a)(1)(A) as the provision for redressing infringements of 
unregistered marks or names, whereas section 1125(a)(1)(B) involves claims for false advertising."" 5 McCarthy on Trademarks 
anf Unfair Competition § 27:9, at 27-20."
675,11, No party argues that the conduct at issue here does not satisfy this element.
675,12," No party argues that the Westside Name is functional. See Int'l Jensen, Inc. v. Metrosound U.S.A., Inc., 4 F.3d 819, 824 (9th 
Cir. 1993) (""A trademark... is functional if it is essential to the product s use or purpose or of it affects the cost or quality of the 
article."")."
675,13," ""[A] product's trademark.. .acquires secondary meaning when the purchasing public associates the mark...with a single 
producer or source rather than with the product itself."" Int'l Jensen, 4 F.3d at 824."
675,14," It could be argued that Westside provides not goods (i.e. German Shepherds), but services (the rescuing and adopting out of 
German Shepherds). In that case, the Westside Name would be a service father than a trademark. In any event, the analysis is 
identical for purposes of this dispute See Am. Int'l Group, Inc. v. Am. Int'l Bank, 926 F.2d 829, 830 n.l (9th Cir. 1991); 15 U.S.C. 
§§ 1053, 1127. "
676,15," Plaintiff objects to this declaration on the grounds that it is inadmissible hearsay, draws an improper legal conclusion, is 
speculative, and violates the Best Evidence Rule. Objections at 3. The Court, however, may take judicial notice on its own 
initiative of the rejected trademark application because it is a matter ot public record. See Fed. R. Evid. 201(c); Allen v. City of 
L.A., 92 F.3d 842, 849 n.7 (9th Cir. 1996) overruled on other grounds by Acri v. Varian Assocs.. Inc., 114 F.3d 999 (9th Cir. 
1997)."
676,16," ""Exclusive"" use means use by only a single party or those authorized by that party. See e.g. Transgo, Inc. v. Ajac 
Transmission Parts Corp., 768 F.2d 1001, 1016 (1985) (use exclusive prior to infringer's entry into the market). "
677,17," In addition, there would seem to be a question here as to just who comprises the purchasing public for a non-profit such as 
Plaintiff. Would it be those who adopt dogs? Would it be those who place dogs out for adoption, such as the Santa Maria or 
Santa Barbara animal shelters? Would it be those who are looking to make donations? Or would it be all or some combination of 
the foregoing? See, e.g., Comm, for Idaho's High Desert Inc. v. Yost, 92 F.3d 814, 822 (9th Cir. 1996) (affirming, as not clearly 
erroneous district court determination that relevant consumer group for purposes of secondary meaning included ""members and 
potential members, public officials and agencies involved in making policy decisions on [the] land [m question], conservationist 
groups and individuals, and other members of the interested public ) Plaintiff has not endeavored to explain why any of the 
evidence it presents fits within the relevant purchasing-consumer public here."
677,18," The admissibility of this statement is questionable, but Defendants have made no objection to it. "
678,19, See p. 9-11 infra; Opposition at 5.
678,20," Some courts have addressed the intentional copying issue by analyzing it as if there were only two possible reasons for such 
behavior - 1) to intend to deceive or confuse the public, and 2) to take advantage of the intrinsic economic benefits of wholly 
functional features. See, e.g., Finance Exp. LLC v. Nowcom Corp., 564 F.Supp.2d 1160, 1171 (CD. Cal. 2008). It is not at all 
clear that the possible reasons should be so limited, nor that the Fuddrucker's court intended such a limitation. "
679,21," Plaintiff objects to this declaration on the grounds that it lacks foundation and personal knowledge, makes an improper legal 
conclusion, and is vague and ambiguous as to the term ""distinctive."" Objections at 2-3."
679,22, Plaintiff objects to this declaration on the grounds that it lacks foundation and personal knowledge. Objections at 3.
679,23, Plaintiff objects to this declaration on the grounds that it lacks foundation and personal knowledge. Objections at 4.
679,24," The California Revenue and Taxation Code section 23301 states, ""Except for the purposes of filing an application for 
exempt status or amending the articles of incorporation ... the corporate powers, rights and privileges of a domestic tax-payer 
may be suspended ...."" Cal. Rev. & T. Code § 23301. "
680,25, Plaintiff's claims brought pursuant to the California Corporations Code will be discussed further infra.
680,26," The more broadly the consumer or relevant public (i.e. the ""rescue community"") is defined, for instance, to include volunteers 
and employees of shelters, the more likely Plaintiff's evidence of confusion is relevant to the showing of secondary meaning."
680,27," Likelihood of confusion is the basic test for both common aw and federal statutoy trademark infringement. See Dr. Seuss 
Enters., L.P. v. Penguin Books USA, Inc., 109 F.3d 1394, 1403 (9th Cir.) cer. dimissed, 521 U.S. 1146, 118 S. Ct. 27, 138 L. Ed. 
2d 1057 (1997). Secondary meaging also applies. See Armstrong Paint & Varnish Works v. Nu-Enamel Corp., 305 U.S. 315, 
335-36, 59 S. Ct. 191, 83 L. Ed. 195, 1939 Dec. Comm'r Pat. 838 (1938); Dep't of Parks & Recreation v. Bazaar del Mundo Inc., 
448 (9th Cir. 2006); First Brands Corp. v. Fred Meyer, Inc., 809 F.2d 1378, 1381 (9th Cir 1987); N.C Dairy, Inc. v. Foremost-
Mackesson, Inc., 92 Cal. App. 3d 98, 106, 107, 154 Cal. Rptr. 794 & n.5 (1979). Therefore, the analysis for Plaintiff's common 
law trademark claim woulf be congruous (or at least no party has suggested otherwise). "
681,28, Sparks Decl. at ¶ 4.
681,29," Ward Decl. at ¶ 3, Robin Jampol Decl. at ¶ 22 & Ex. B."
681,30, Robin Jampol Decl. at ¶ 23 & Ex. C. 
682,31," Plaintiff claims, however, to have adopted out thousands of dogs in almost twenty other states and Canada under the 
Westside Name. Robin Jampol Decl. at ¶ 4."
682,32," Though the Southland Sod court indicated that a plaintiff could demonstrate ""falsity"" by showing that the statement either was 
literally false ""or that the statement was literally true but likely to mislead or confuse consumers "" 108 F 3d at 1139, if that rule is 
applied in the situation where the only statement made is the mere use of an allegedly infringed mark, it threatens to eliminate 
any difference between a false advertising claim and a false association claim (Southland Sod itself involved ""product 
superiority"" claims contained in comparison advertisements, see id. at 1138). It may be that this observation is meaningless or 
immaterial, but the parties might at least be given the opportunity to discuss it. "
683,33," In addition to prohibiting unlawful acts (which would presume Plaintiff had some independent lawful protection with respect to 
the Westside Name), California Business and Professions Code section 17200 prohibits unfair and fraudulent business acts. 
See Sybersound Records, Inc. v. UAV Corp., 517 F.3d 1137, 1151 (9th Cir 2008) ""Unfair acts among competitors means 
conduct that threatens an incipient violation of an antitrust law, or violates the spirit or policy of those laws because its effects 
are comparable to or the same as a violation of the law, or otherwise significantly threatens or harms competition. Id. (quoting 
Cel-Tech Commons. Inc. v. L.A. Cellular Tel. Co., 20 Cal.4th 163, 187, 83 Cal. Rptr. 2d 548, 973 P.2d 527 (1999)). ""[F]raudulent 
acts are ones where members of the public are likely to be deceived."" Id. (citing Nat'l Rual Telecom. Co-op v. DIRECTV, Inc., 
319 F.Supp.2d 1059, 1077-78 (CD. Cal. 2003)). Plaintiff presently appears to limit its section 17200 claim to the ""unlawful"" 
prong of that statute. "
684,34," This is perhaps especially curious in this case given that after Pollock adopted the Westside Name as the name of Pollock's 
Organization with the Secretary of State, the Secretary nonetheless allowed Plaintiff to obtain the name it currently uses, which 
merely omits the word ""German"" from the Westside Name. "
686,35," Arguably, at least some of Plaintiff's evidence would be considered inadmissible. However, Defendants have not objected. "
689,1," Defendants are State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (""State Farm""), Allstate Indemnity Company (""Allstate""), 
GEICO General Insurance Company (""GEICO""), Liberty Mutual Fire Insurance Company (""Liberty"") (collectively, ""Defendant 
automobile insurance companies"" or ""Defendant AICs""), and Certified Automotive Parts Association (""CAPA""). "
691,2," The Court primarily relies on the Joint Motion, because Defendant  [*10] Liberty Mutual's individual Motion is limited to 
rehashing the argument made in the Joint Motion that Plaintiffs fail to meet the Twombly pleading standard."
691,3," (Plaintiffs' Combined Opposition to Defendants' Renewed Joint Motion to Dismiss and Liberty Mutual's Motion to Dismiss at 4, 
hereafter, ""Opposition,"" Docket Item No. 133.) "
692,4," The procedure for insurance rate-setting in California was elaborated on by the Court of Appeal in Walker: ""Subsequent to 
passage of Proposition 103, every insurer which desires to change any rate shall file a complete rate application with the 
commissioner. The commissioner shall notify the public of any such application. A hearing may be held if the commissioner, 
either on his or her own motion or pursuant to the request of a consumer, determines to do so and must be held, upon timely 
request, if the proposed rate increase exceeds certain percentages. The initiative includes several provisions governing the 
conduct of such rate hearings. The commissioner shall not approve a rate which is excessive, inadequate, unfairly discriminatory 
or otherwise in violation of this chapter."" 77 Cal. App. 4th at 752 (quoting California Auto. Assigned Risk Plan v. Garamendi, 232 
Cal. App. 3d 904, 909-10, 283 Cal. Rptr. 562 (1991)) (internal citations omitted)."
692,5," Chapter 9 ""set[s] forth a comprehensive scheme for the regulation of rates and rating practices."" Walker, 77 Cal. App. 4th at 
754."
692,6," With respect to the interplay between section 1861.03 and sections 1860.1 and 1860.2, the Court of Appeal stated that it ""need 
not determine the outer contours"" of any modification of the latter two sections by section 1861.03.  [*15] Walker, 77 Cal. App. "
693,4," th at 756. Instead, the court concluded that sections 1860.1 and 1860.2 ""retain more than enough vitality to bar [the plaintiffs'] 
present claims."" Id. "
694,7," The allegations in Gilchrist are substantively identical to those here. Compare Gilchrist, 390 F.3d at 1332, with SAC ¶¶ 4, 25,

Remedies Act, and Monopolization of Business Practices P 18, hereafter, ""Complaint,"" Docket Item No. 1.) "
701,2," In light of the Court's determination in the Direct Purchaser Action that, as a matter of law, the Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs' tying 
claims could not proceed, the Court declines to certify any class on the basis of Plaintiff's tying claims in this Indirect Purchaser 
Action. Indeed, the tying claims in the two actions are based on substantively identical allegations surrounding Defendant's 
alleged creation of a coercive technological interrelationship between iPods and iTMS products. Accordingly, the Court need not 
consider issues surrounding methods of proving coercion on a class-wide basis."
701,3," See also In re Methionine Antitrust Litig., 204 F.R.D. 161, 164 (N.D. Cal. 2002) (""to prove that each class member was actually

702,4," Judge Alsup also declined to certify an indirect purchaser class under Rule 23(b)(2), on the ground that the plaintiffs primarily 
sought money damages. As an additional rationale for denial of the 23(b)(2) class, Judge Alsup certified the antitrust claims of a 
parallel direct purchaser class, and found that the direct purchaser class' claims were adequate  [**15] to ""cure any ongoing 
harm."" Graphics Processing, 253 F.R.D. at 508."

705,1," Although XR has filed its motion as a ""Motion for Partial Summary Judgment,"" the Court treats this motion as a motion to 
dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). "
707,2," These copyrightable elements allegedly included the selection and arrangement of informational category headings and market 
data compiled by I.M.S. I.M.S., 307 F. Supp.2d at 523."

707,4, Stockroom has not provided this Court with any controlling authority on the issue of registration. (See Opp'n Br. 2-4.)
707,5," Stockroom's copyright infringement claim incorporates these allegations by reference. (Docket No. 1, Compl. ¶¶ 11, 14.) "
708,6, Stockroom does not appear to dispute XR's claims regarding the registration requirement. (See Opp'n Br. 2-3.)
708,7," Courts have held that as a matter of efficiency, ""a failure to allege registration can be cured if the plaintiff registers the copyright 
and files an amended complaint including an allegation that the copyrighted work is registered."" Zito v. Steeplechase Films, Inc., 
267 F. Supp. 2d 1022, 1025 (N.D. Cal. 2003); see also M.G.B. Homes, Inc. v. Ameron Homes, Inc., 903 F.2d 1486, 1489 (11th 
Cir. 1990); Frankel v. Stein and Day, Inc., 470 F. Supp. 209, 212 n.2 (S.D.N.Y. 1979)."
708,8," It appears from the Complaint that the gravamen of the claim is ""reverse passing off"" under § 1125(a) and the Opposition 
supports this view. (See Docket No. 1, Compl.¶¶ 8-9, 17.; Opp'n Br. 4.) "
712,9," The exception is limited: ""where a [claimant] is only seeking damages from a [. . .] defendant's reproduction of a work-and not

714,10," The Court also finds significant that unlike the plaintiff in Johnson, Stockroom moves to amend in response to a motion to 
dismiss. See 975 F.2d at 607-08."
714,11," The Court also notes that a ""trial court is given broad discretion in supervising the pretrial phase of litigation, and its decisions 
regarding the preclusive effect of a pretrial order . . . will not be disturbed unless they evidence a clear abuse of discretion.""

734,4," At oral argument plaintiffs clarified that they predicated their price-fixing case on defendants' conspiracy to submit to the DOI 
one uniform rate, 80% of which was attributed to commissions for the title insurance agents, which in turn included the cost of 
the alleged kickbacks and other financial inducements."
734,5," On December 5, 2008, the court stayed the action against defendant LandAmerica Financial Group, Inc. following its voluntary 
filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. "
735,6," The ICA prohibits discriminatory pricing in shipping rates to prevent carriers from giving some customers discounts to the 
competitive disadvantage of other, disfavored customers. See Keogh, 260 U.S. at 163 (explaining the ""paramount purpose of 
Congress"" in enacting regulation of rates: ""prevention of unjust discrimination""). "
736,7," Plaintiffs argue that state, not federal, law governs the application of the filed rate doctrine, but in support plaintiffs cite to cases 
where the filed rate doctrine threatened to preclude a cause of action grounded solely in state law. (Pls.' Mem. Law Opp'n Defs.' 
Joint Mot. to Dismiss Consolidated Compl. 6-7.) Here, because federal antitrust law, and not state law, provides the basis of 
plaintiffs' complaint, plaintiffs' cited cases do not control. See, e.g., Blaylock v. First Am. Title Ins. Co., 504 F. Supp. 2d 1091, 
1102-03 (W.D. Wash. 2007) (looking to state precedent to determine applicability of filed rate doctrine to cause of action arising 
under state law)."
736,8," In Old Forge School District v. Highmark, Inc., the Pennsylvania Supreme Court held that a party could properly bring a breach 
of contract and unjust enrichment suit arising out of insurance rates because Ciamaichelo's holding undermined presumption 
 [**29] that ""challenges to rates and reserves are entirely within the sound discretion of the [relevant agency] and are not the 
proper subject of adversary litigation."" 592 Pa. 307, 924 A.2d 1205, 1213 (Pa. 2007). Because these plaintiffs sought relief under 
breach of contract and unjust enrichment theories, this decision does not diminish the applicability of the filed rate doctrine to 
antitrust claims based on rates filed with a state agency. "
738,9," In fact, the Wileman court went so far as to suggest that, although it could not consider it on a motion to dismiss, evidence of 
some agency review of the rates would suffice to apply the filed rate doctrine. See Wileman, 909 F.2d at 338 (""Defendants' 
evidence of participation by representatives of the Secretary cannot be considered on a motion to dismiss. The bare fact of non-
disapproval, then, . . . is all that is before the court . . .""). "
739,10," In finding no meaningful review requirement for application of the filed rate doctrine, the court recognizes the appearance of a 
conflict with the state action doctrine. Under the state action doctrine, private entities participating in state-administered price 
regulation can have immunity from antitrust laws. Cal. Retail Liquor Dealers Ass'n v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc., 445 U.S. 97, 105, 
100 S. Ct. 937, 63 L. Ed. 2d 233 (1980); see also Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S. 341, 352, 63 S. Ct. 307, 87 L. Ed. 315 (1943) 
(holding state regulatory programs immune from antitrust laws). This immunity applies if: (1) state policy clearly articulates and 
affirmatively expresses the price regulation and (2) the state actively supervises the implementation of the price regulation, 
Midcal, 445 U.S. at 105, as opposed to merely giving ""deference to private pricefixing arrangements,"" FTC v. Ticor Title Ins. Co., 
504 U.S. 621, 633, 112 S. Ct. 2169, 119 L. Ed. 2d 410 (1992). For prices, such as title insurance rates in Pennsylvania, ""set as 
an initial matter by private parties, subject only to a [discretionary state] veto, . . . immunity [attaches only if] state officials have 
undertaken the necessary  [**42] steps to determine the specifics of the price-fixing or ratesetting scheme."" FTC, 504 U.S. at 
638. ""The mere potential for state supervision"" does not suffice. Id. Here, the filed rate doctrine precludes defendants' liability for damages from antitrust violations because the statutory scheme 
requires title insurers to file rates and provides authority for review by the DOI, irrespective of the actual level of DOI review. 
Arguably then, the filed rate doctrine applies based on the mere potential for state supervision, even though under the state 
action doctrine the Court rejected ""potential supervision"" as a ground to preclude antitrust liability. FTC, 504 U.S. at 638. Thus, 
as one commentator has observed, the lack of a meaningful review requirement ""seem[s] to stretch the [filed rate] doctrine so far 
as to make it snap, since the effect is to completely circumvent the 'active state supervision' requirement for State Action 
immunity."" Holmes, supra, § 8:6. Despite this observation, there exists no apparent requirement of alignment between the 
preclusive effect of the filed rate doctrine and the state action doctrine, as courts have treated the two doctrines as independent 
bases for  [**43] antitrust immunity. See Trigen Okla. City Energy Corp. v. Okla. Gas & Elec. Co., 244 F.3d 1220, 1224-1225 
(10th Cir. 2001) (dismissing action under state action doctrine and as a result declining to reach filed rate doctrine); City of 
Kirkwood v. Union Elec. Co., 671 F.2d 1173, 1182 (8th Cir. 1982) (treating filed rate doctrine and state action doctrine as 
independent grounds for court's grant of antitrust immunity); Green v. Peoples Energy Corp., No. 02 C 4117, 2003 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 4958, 2003 WL 1712566, at *4, *8 (N.D. Ill. Mar. 28, 2003) (holding ""filed rate doctrine bars plaintiffs' [antitrust] claims"" 
and holding ""state action doctrine also independently bars plaintiffs' claims under the federal antitrust laws"") "
740,11," The shipper did file ""specified rates to be charged per mile of carriage,"" but instead of providing a ""list of distances . . . on 
which a shipper could rely in calculating charges for a given shipment,"" the shipper referred to a mileage guide composed by a 
ratings bureau of member shippers. Kmart Corp., 511 U.S. at 433. Because the shipper did not renew his membership in the 
ratings bureau, his rates could not properly refer to the ratings bureau's mileage guides. Id. Without the mileage guides, 
determining the actual charge for a particular shipment was impossible. Id."
740,12," Plaintiffs do not mention an agency's costs for rent or mortgage payments on an office, employees' wages and salaries, title 
searches, supplies, equipment, advertising, training, taxes, or other routine expenses inherent in operating any business. "
741,13," Defendants argue at length that plaintiffs' ""improperly filed"" argument essentially seeks a fraud exception to the filed rate 
doctrine based on defendants' failure to disclose the extent to which costs for kickbacks and inducements affected the rate filed. 
As defendants correctly point out, ""there is no fraud exception to the filed rate doctrine."" AT & T Corp. v. JMC Telecom, LLC, 470 
F.3d 525, 535 (3d Cir. 2006),  [**49] cert. denied, 551 U.S. 1103, 127 S. Ct. 2913, 168 L. Ed. 2d 243 (2007); see also Square D, 
476 U.S. at 412-13, 417 (holding that the filed rate doctrine applies even where defendants' filed rate arises essentially out of 
fraud). Conversely, the statutory scheme governing title insurance rates prohibits giving fraudulent information that would affect 
title insurance rates to be made effective by the DOI. See 40 Pa. Stat. Ann. § 910-47. The court need not resolve this apparent 
tension between federal common law and Pennsylvania's statutory provisions for title insurance because plaintiffs' improper 
filing argument fails as explained above and plaintiffs specifically disavowed reliance on the fraud exception."
741,14," Specifically, defendants conspired to prevent low-cost, non-railroad shippers from unloading and transporting iron ore from 
Lake Erie to points inland to the detriment of plaintiffs, which were steel, dock, and truck companies. Lake Erie, 998 F.2d at 
1152-53. "
743,15," In fact, at oral argument, plaintiffs explained that adjudication of this suit would require this court to calculate damages as the 
difference between the filed title insurance rates and what the rates would have been ""but for"" defendants' conspiracy to set 
rates collectively."
743,16, In no place in their complaint do plaintiffs state that they availed themselves of this opportunity. 
745,17," Due to the preclusive effect of the filed rate doctrine, plaintiffs' claim for damages fails as a matter of law. Therefore, no 
amendment can cure this problem and dismissal with prejudice is warranted. See Alston v. Parker, 363 F.3d 229, 235 (3d Cir. 
2004) (""[I]f a complaint is vulnerable to 12(b)(6) dismissal, a District Court must permit a curative amendment, unless an 
amendment would be inequitable or futile.""). "
746,19," Those corporate parent defendants include: Fidelity National Financial, Inc.; First American Corporation; Stewart Information 
Services Corporation; and Old Republic International Corporation. See supra Section I.C., note 3."
746,20," Initially, defendants argued that the parents could not be held vicariously liable for their subsidiaries' participation in the alleged 
conspiracy. (Defs.' Mem. Law Supp. Joint Mot. to Dismiss Consolidated Comp. with Prejudice 11-12.) In response, plaintiffs 
explicitly disavowed that they seek ""to impose vicarious liability"" on parent defendants for their subsidiaries' conduct. (Pls.' Mem. 
Law Opp'n Ds.' Joint Mot. to Dismiss Consolidated Compl. 32 n.20.) Therefore,  [**72] the court will not consider the issue of 
parents' vicarious liability for subsidiaries' participation in the alleged conspiracy. "
747,21," The Court further explained that a ""parent and a wholly owned subsidiary always have a 'unity of purpose or a common 
design,'"" Copperweld, 467 U.S. at 771 (quotation and citation omitted), as the parent ""may assert full control at any moment if 
the subsidiary fails to act in the parent's best interests,"" id. at 771-72."
747,22," Plaintiffs allege that some parent defendants wholly own and control their subsidiaries, (e.g., CC P 14), while others wholly 
own and/or control their subsidiaries, (e.g., CC P 12). For the purposes of this motion, the court will read the complaint in the 
light most favorable to the plaintiffs and presume that all corporate parents wholly own and control their respective subsidiaries. "
748,23," Because plaintiffs could amend their complaint with allegations of parent defendants' independent participation in the alleged 
conspiracy, the court does not find dismissal with prejudice warranted. See Alston, 363 F.3d at 235. "
759,1," According to Appellant, in 2006, the bank charged $ 17 per item for the first overdraft day, $ 30 per item for the second and 
third overdraft days, $ 37 per item if the account was overdrawn for four days or more, and a $ 5 ""Sustained Overdraft Fee"" if an 
account remained overdrawn for more than six consecutive business days. Appellant claims the overdraft fee structure changed 
in 2007 to $ 35 per item for the first, second, and third overdraft days,  [**3] and $ 38 per item for four or more overdraft days. 
The ""Sustained Overdraft Fee"" was apparently increased to $ 35. "
760,2," We agree with the District Court that St. Clair's allegations are sufficient to confer standing, as he alleged the type of harm the 
antitrust laws were intended to prevent and a personal injury stemming from the Defendants' alleged unlawful acts as required 
by Gulfstream III Assocs., Inc. v. Gulfstream Aerospace Corp., 995 F.2d 425, 429 (3d Cir. 1993). See also Angelico v. Lehigh 
Valley Hospital, Inc., 184 F.3d 268, 274 (3d Cir. 1999). We also note, as did the District Court, that the language of the relevant portions of the New Jersey Antitrust Act is virtually 
identical to that of the Sherman Antitrust Act and that the New Jersey Act itself mandates that it ""shall be construed in harmony 
with  [**6] the ruling judicial interpretations of comparable Federal antitrust statutes and to effectuate, insofar as practicable, a 
uniformity in the laws of those states which enact it."" N.J.S.A. 56:9-18; Patel v. Soriano, 369 N.J. Super. 192, 848 A.2d 803, 826 
(N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div., 2004). Accordingly, the state law antitrust claims are only viable if the corresponding federal claims 
are sufficient. "
777,1," HN1[
] On a motion for summary judgment, the Court views the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Ludwig v. Anderson, 54 F.3d 465, 470 (8th Cir. 1995)."
777,2," The dominant credit score is Fair Isaac's FICO(R) Classic score. 3d Am. Compl. PP 22, 40. In collaboration with the individual 
Credit Bureaus, Fair Isaac developed  [**8] variations of its FICO algorithms tailored to each bureau's data set. Id. PP 29, 40."
777,3," Pursuant to agreements with each bureau, however, Fair Isaac does occasionally sell FICO scores, bundled with a bureau's 
credit report, directly to lenders or consumers in exchange for an access fee to the bureaus. 3d Am. Compl. PP 45-46."
777,4," Because Fair Isaac modifies its algorithm for each bureau's data set, FICO scores are reputedly a better reflection of credit risk 
regardless of which bureau's data set is used. 3d Am. Compl. P 40. "
778,5," The Credit Bureaus' joint venture is sometimes referred to as Project Trident and at other times, Operation Triad. For 
convenience,  [**12] the Court will uniformly refer to the joint venture as Project Trident. "
779,6," By agreement of the parties, the June 23, 2008 Order also dismissed Fair Isaac's state law claim of ""illegal concerted refusal to 
deal."" "
781,7," The Classic Agreement and the Horizon Agreement are governed by Illinois law, whereas the NextGen Agreement is governed 
by California Law. Classic Agreement § 7.17; Horizon Agreement § 13.13; NextGen Agreement § 13.13. "
782,8," The difficulties posed by Fair Isaac's breach of contract claim flow from the trade-secrets claim having been withdrawn and 
dismissed. Fair Isaac argues that ""[t]here  [**25] are many alternative approaches, as Professor Hand explains in his expert 
report, that [Trans Union] and the other bureaus could have used to construct a scoring model,"" but, ""[i]nstead, they chose to 
copy [Fair Isaac's] approach."" Fair Isaac's Mem. in Opp'n to Mot. for Summ. J. Dismissing Contract Related Counts at 10. This 
argument appears to be an attempt to masquerade a trade- secret claim as a breach of contract claim. Either the characteristics 
of the VantageScore scoring model are so similar to the unique, confidential characteristics of Fair Isaac's scoring models that 
there has been a misappropriation of a trade secret, or the characteristics of VantageScore are similar to those of Fair Isaac 
simply because those characteristics are matters of common knowledge in the credit scoring industry. Fair Isaac declined, 
whether for business reasons, strategic litigation reasons, or otherwise, to identify the precise trade secret that was allegedly 
misappropriated and, consequently, withdrew the trade-secret claim. To hold Fair Isaac to this decision, the aspects and 
concepts in the VantageScore scoring model that are similar to those in Fair Isaac's scoring models must be viewed as 
 [**26] being commonly known to the trade rather than confidential, trade secrets. Whether Fair Isaac may even contractually 
prohibit Trans Union from competing through the use of non-confidential information is not clear. Cf. Am. Credit Indem. Co. v. 
Sacks, 213 Cal. App. 3d 622, 262 Cal. Rptr. 92, 99 (Cal. Ct. App. 1989) (I]n the absence of a protectable trade secret, the right 
to compete fairly outweighs the employer's right to protect . . . against competition from former employees.""). "
784,9," The court determined that the plaintiff's separate breach of contract claim (based on the theory that the nature of the 
contractual relationship imposed a ""best efforts"" obligation) ""echoe[d]"" the breach of fiduciary duty claim and failed for the same 
reasons. Id. at 867-68."
784,10," Fair Isaac does not contend that the tortious interference claim can be maintained independently of a viable breach of contract 
claim. See Fair Isaac's Mem. in Opp'n to Mot. for Summ. J. Dismissing Contract Related Counts at 12. "
785,11," HN10[
] The standing principles for damages under § 4 are slightly different from those for injunctive relief under § 16. See Midwest Commc'ns, 779 F.2d at 450. For example, given the nature of an injunction, there is no risk of duplicative recoveries, 
and thus, the consideration of that factor is not relevant to evaluating standing under § 16. See Cargill, 479 U.S. at 111 n.6. 
Accordingly, the Court will address the standing issue regarding the two types of relief separately, although much of the analysis 
of § 4 relief applies to the analysis of § 16 relief also. "
786,12, There is no allegation of predatory pricing here.
786,13," There is evidence in the record suggesting that on a single occasion, Equifax  [**43] raised the price charged to one lender for 
FICO scores. See, e.g., Bial Decl., Ex. 201 (Kramers-Dove Dep., June 11, 2008) 762:11-763:20. Fair Isaac cites this incident in 
support of the claim that Defendants engaged in efforts to convince lenders to switch to VantageScore. It is disputed whether 
this claimed incident of raising FICO scores prices actually occurred. See id., Ex. 199 (Noll Dep.) 272:14-275:18. There also 
appears to be a dispute about what inferences may be drawn from suggestions that certain credit bureaus independently 
decided to limit Fair Isaac's access to certain credit data and its significance to the antitrust claims. See Fair Isaac's Mem. in 
Opp'n to Mot. for Summ. J. Dismissing Antitrust Claims at 21, 27, 29; Defs.' Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. Dismissing 
Antitrust Counts at 30-32. Even viewing the evidence of raising FICO scores prices and limiting access to data in the light most 
favorable to Fair Isaac, standing is still lacking. Fair Isaac's expert on damages, Meyer, opined that VantageScore's presence in 
the marketplace caused Fair Isaac to suffer lost profits, but he did not establish a causal link that Fair Isaac's lost profits were 
attributable  [**44] to the claimed instance of raising FICO scores prices and limiting Fair Isaac's access to data. See Meyer 
Report at 14-16. "
788,14," The portions of the record that Fair Isaac cites in support of its argument fail  [**52] to show that Defendants made remarks 
about FICO scores that could properly be viewed as being misleading, false, or disparaging. For example, Fair Isaac relies on 
the following entries of Trans Union employee's call logs with customers: (1) ""Explaining FICO away by saying it is a business 
score and TC is consumer score""; (2) ""Customer wants FICO, told her she does NOT NEED IT""; and (3) ""[Customer] upset that 
we don't use the FICO score, I explained benefits of [VantageScore] and told him FICO SCORES ARE VERY EXPENSIVE."" Bial 
Decl., Ex. 182, entry nos. 1267647, 1268411, 1271913. "
791,15," In light of the grant of summary judgment, the Court will not address Defendants' arguments that there is a failure of proof on 
the substantive elements necessary to prove the alleged antitrust violations. "
794,16," In their reply brief, Defendants advance a two-fold attack on the evidence Fair Isaac presents to demonstrate confusion. Defs.' 
Reply Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. Dismissing Trademark-Related Counts [Docket No. 637] at 5-6. First, they argue that 
the evidence, although  [**73] it shows confusion generally regarding credit scores, fails to show that the confusion was caused 
by Defendants' credit scores employing scoring ranges similar to the 300-850 range. Fair Isaac's expert, James Berger, opined, 
however that there was a ""direct correlation between the level of consumer confusion"" and the similarity of the numeric range 
employed in Defendants' credit scores to Fair Isaac's 300-850 mark. Collyard Decl., Mar. 5, 2009, Ex. 36 (Berger Report) P 51. 
Defendants' contention that causation has not been adequately proved and their criticisms of Berger's methodology in 
conducting the survey are weight-and-credibility matters for the factfinder. Defendants' second argument, that the confusion 
evidence is ""classic hearsay and cannot be used to defeat [summary judgment],"" lacks merit. Defs.' Reply Mem. in Supp. of Mot. 
for Summ. J. Dismissing Trademark-Related Counts at 5. Both Fair Isaac and Defendants are likely to offer consumer 
information at trial. Defendants first raised the hearsay argument in their reply brief and failed to provide a meaningful 
explanation of why such evidence is hearsay (offered for the truth of the matter asserted) and, if so, why it is inadmissible 
 [**74] hearsay. Given the absence of adequate briefing, Defendant's hearsay issue will be determined, if necessary, at a later 
time."
794,17," Defendants also argue that the claim against Trans Union fails because Trans Union purchased the keywords in carrying out 
its contractual obligation to Fair Isaac to market FICO scores. But, as Fair Isaac argues, fact issues remain regarding whether 
Trans Union used the keywords in connection with websites that did not offer FICO scores. "
795,18," J.G. Wentworth, S.S.C. Ltd. P'Ship v. Settlement Funding LLC, No. 06-0597, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 288, 2007 WL 30115, at 
*6-8 (E.D. Pa. Jan. 4, 2007)  [**78] (concluding that because a link to a defendant's website appears on the search results page 
as one of many choices for the potential consumer to investigate, no ""likelihood of confusion"" existed as a matter of law); Gov't

2005) (same). "
796,19," The are no allegations that the claims of product superiority made any reference to scientific testing, which require only proof 
that the tests relied upon were not  [**84] sufficiently reliable to permit one to conclude with reasonable certainty that they 
established the proposition for which they were cited. See United Indus., 140 F.3d at 1182 (quotation omitted). "
797,20," For clarity, the surviving claims are Counts One, Two, Three, Four, and those aspects of Counts Six and Seven that relate to 
the alleged infringement, unfair competition, and passing off. "
802,1," Buyers only pursue a per se prohibition in federal antitrust  [**5] law; they do not alternatively argue that the Realtors' practice 
could be found unlawful under a rule of reason analysis. See, e.g., United States v. Microsoft Corp., 253 F.3d 34, 93-97, 346 
U.S. App. D.C. 330 (D.C. Cir. 2001). Although the complaint asserts a claim under the Idaho analogue of the Sherman Act, 
Idaho Code § 48-101, no discrete arguments are made with respect to liability under that statute. The complaint also states a 
claim under the Idaho Consumer Protection Act, Idaho Code § 48-601, that has been stayed pending this appeal. "
804,2," It is possible to read an earlier statement in Jefferson Parish in isolation to suggest a tying claim exists even if the purchaser 
did not want to buy a tied product. In this passage  [**11] the Court said that ""the essential characteristic of an invalid tying 
arrangement lies in the seller's exploitation of its control over the tying product to force the buyer into the purchase of a tied 
product that the buyer either did not want at all, or might have preferred to purchase elsewhere on different terms."" 466 U.S. at 
12. However, it is clear from reading all of Jefferson Parish that HN5[
] per se condemnation does not apply where the plaintiff 
would not have otherwise purchased the tied product, even from another seller. Jefferson Parish, 466 U.S. at 16; see also Wells 
Real Estate, 850 F.2d at 814-15 (reading the statement in Jefferson Parish, 466 U.S. at 12, as pertaining to injury and standing 
to sue, not to the ""not insubstantial"" volume of commerce that is foreclosed by the tie)."
804,3," For this they rely on a discussion in Barber & Ross Co. v. Lifetime Doors, Inc., 810 F.2d 1276 (4th Cir. 1987), that has to do 
with antitrust standing. Standing is not at issue here, and Barber & Ross does not address the problem of ""zero foreclosure"" 
because the plaintiff in that case wanted to purchase the tied product from other sellers."
804,4," Buyers frame their theory of the tied product market exclusively from the perspective of similarly-situated purchasers of 
developed lots. The record reveals no attempt to define the market from the view of home-builders or realtors that potentially 
would have competed to supply the tied product. "
805,5," HN8[
] Rule 56(f) states: If a party opposing the motion shows by affidavit that, for specified reasons, it cannot present facts essential to justify its 
opposition, the court may: (1) deny the motion; (2) order a continuance to enable affidavits to be obtained, depositions to be 
taken, or other discovery to be undertaken; or (3) issue any other just order. HN9[

826,1," With respect to this first count, the plaintiffs invoke the laws of the District of Columbia, Florida, Hawaii, Iowa, Kansas, 
Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, South 
Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia and Wisconsin. Am. Compl, PP 196-228. "

Carolina, South Dakota, Utah, Vermont, Washington and West Virginia, as well as the District of Columbia. Am. Compl, PP 229-
272."
827,3," The defendants filed motions to dismiss the plaintiffs' original complaint on September 10, 2008. The Court held oral argument 
on those motions on February 26, 2009, at which time the issue of the named  [**6] plaintiffs' standing to assert claims under the 
statutes of the various states referenced in the original complaint was a central point of contention. The plaintiffs filed an 
amended complaint on March 26, 2009, mooting those motions to dismiss. The amended complaint is substantially identical to 
the original complaint except that it alleges that the plaintiffs have members who purchased Wellbutrin XL in more states than 
were stated in the original complaint. "
831,4," The plaintiffs argue that waiting to decide whether they may represent proposed class members from states where the plaintiffs 
themselves allege no relevant injury would not be a deferral of an Article III standing analysis. Indeed, the plaintiffs recognize 
that Article III standing is a prerequisite to their suit, but argue that an injury providing standing under the law of some state is 
enough to provide for standing to bring a claims on behalf of proposed class members from all states. The plaintiffs argue that 
once they have established an injury, causation and redressability, in connection to some state law claim, a court need only to 
determine whether they are adequate representatives of the proposed class under Rule 23. However, HN11[
] because a 
standing analysis requires a plaintiff to establish standing on a claim by claim basis, the threshold question of standing is not 
satisfied by an assertion of standing on less than all claims. In attempting to defer the consideration of the plaintiffs' ""ability to 
represent"" proposed class members from states where the plaintiffs themselves allege no injury, the plaintiffs' argue,  [**22] in 
essence, that an Article III standing analysis is premature. "
833,5," The plaintiffs also cite to several district court cases from outside of the Third Circuit. Opp'n at 21-23. They cite to In re

Marketing Litigation, 614 F. Supp. 2d 1037, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 36133, at *44 (N.D. Cal. 2009), which adopted readings of 
Ortiz consistent with that in Clark. One case plaintiffs cite stated in dicta that ""in these circumstances [comparable to those in this 
case], it is appropriate to decide class certification before resolving alleged Article III challenges of the present kind,"" but went on 
to say that the issue was premature in that the parties had not briefed the question of which state laws applied to the present 
claims. In re Buspirone Patent Litigation, 185 F. Supp. 2d 363, 377 (S.D.N.Y. 2002). Again, the Court declines to follow the 
Buspirone decision: HN14[
] the issue of the named  [**30] plaintiffs standing to assert a particular claim listed in the complaint 
does not depend on choice of law or on class certification. "
835,6," ""[W]e have repeatedly held that HN18[
] the existence of unaddressed  [**38] jurisdictional defects has no precedential 
effect."" Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343, 352 n.2, 116 S. Ct. 2174, 135 L. Ed. 2d 606 (1996). "
836,7," The plaintiffs also cite the following cases as examples of courts allowing named plaintiffs to lead a class on the assertion of 
state laws for which they would not personally have standing to assert the same claim: In re Pharm. Indus. Average Wholesale 
Price Litig., 252 F.R.D. 83 (D. Mass. 2008) (""In a multi-state class, the case law does not create a per se rule that the Court must 
appoint a separate representative for each state or even each group.""); In re Pharm. Indus. Average Wholesale Price Litig., 233 
F.R.D. 229, 230-31 (D. Mass. 2006); In re Relafen Antitrust Litig., 221 F.R.D. 260, 266-70 (D.Mass.2004); Mowbray v. Waste 
Mgmt. Holdings, Inc., 189 F.R.D. 194, 195 (D. Mass. 1999);  [**39] In re Synthroid Mktg. Litig., 188 F.R.D. 295, 302 (N.D. Ill. 
1999) (certifying a class like that proposed in this case, but noting that standing issues ultimately may require decertification of 
the state law counts.). None of these cases explicitly deals with Article III standing requirements. Finally, the plaintiffs cite In re Abbott Labs. Norvir Antitrust Litig., Nos. C 04-1511, C 04-4203, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44459, 
2007 WL 1689899, at *5, *8-*10 (N.D. Cal. Jun. 11, 2007). This case allowed a class of plaintiffs to proceed with claims under 
California law after holding that one of the named plaintiffs had standing to bring such a claim. 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44459, 
[WL] at *5. In that case, the named plaintiff with standing to bring the claim under California law was in fact a resident of 
California who was injured in his personal payments for prescription drugs. 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44459, [WL] at *4. The Norvir 
case, therefore, is support for the requirement of presenting at least one named plaintiff with standing to make a given claim. To 
the extent the plaintiffs rely on that portion of Norvir that permitted the named plaintiffs to proceed on a claim of unjust 
enrichment untied to any particular state, the Court rejects their argument for the reasons provided in  [**40] this section and for 
the reasons provided below in Part III(C)(9). "
840,8," HN31[
] Sections 598A.010-598A.280, which prohibit monopolization and restraints of trade, are collectively titled the ""Nevada Unfair Trade Practice Act."" In order to avoid confusion between this claim and the claim arising under Deceptive Trade 
Practices Act, the Court will refer to the former statute as the ""Nevada antitrust statute."" "
841,9," The plaintiffs attempt to resuscitate their Deceptive Trade Practices Act by requesting that they be permitted to amend their 
complaint to assert claims under a different  [**60] provision of Nevada law. The Court denies the plaintiffs' request for leave to 
amend. The plaintiffs have already had one prior opportunity to amend their complaint so as to state the correct grounds for their 
claims and the Court will not permit amendment of the plaintiffs' case on an rolling basis. "
845,10," The plaintiffs cite Allegheny General Hospital v. Phillip Morris, Inc., 228 F.3d 429, 447 (3d Cir. 2000),  [**72] as support for 
their characterization of the elements of a pan-jurisdictional unjust enrichment claim. Opp'n at 79. Allegheny General Hospital, 
however, focused on the application of the law of a single jurisdiction, Pennsylvania, and did not purport to apply a general rule 
of law common to every state. See, Id."
845,11," See, e.g., Swift v. Tyson, 41 U.S. 1, 10 L. Ed. 865 (1842) (""The law respecting negotiable instruments may be truly declared in 
the languages of Cicero . . . to be in a great measure, not the law of a single country only, but of the commercial world."")."
845,12," Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 58 S. Ct. 817, 82 L. Ed. 1188 (1938) (HN44[
] ""There is no federal general 
common law. Congress has no power to declare substantive rules of common law applicable in a state whether they be local in 
their nature or 'general,' be they commercial law or a part of the law  [**73] of torts. And no clause in the Constitution purports to 
confer such a power upon the federal courts.""). "

854,2," The Honorable Jimm Larry Hendren, United States District Judge for the Western District of Arkansas."
854,3," The district court found that the retroactive application of the Allocable Share Amendment violated appellants' substantive due 
process rights. The State did not appeal that decision, and it is not relevant to this appeal. "
855,4," The OPMs are Philip Morris, Inc., Lorillard Tobacco Company, Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation, and R.J. Reynolds 
Tobacco Company."
855,5, NPMs earn interest on these escrowed funds. 
858,6," Specifically, NPMs controlled 0.4 percent of the cigarette market in 1997 but now control 5.4 percent of the market. And in 
2007, NPMs paid $ 5.02/carton while OPMs paid $ 5.31/carton and SPMs paid $ 5.07/carton. Cuomo, 592 F. Supp. 2d at 692."
858,7," The district court in Cuomo noted that, in Spitzer, the Second Circuit ""accepted Plaintiffs' allegations as if proved, for it was 
reviewing a motion to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)."" Cuomo, 592 F. Supp. 2d at 700. Because the district court 
found that the plaintiffs failed to prove their antitrust allegations, that court stated that ""the foundation for the [Second Circuit's] 
rulings does not exist."" Id. "
865,8," Plaintiffs later alleged that ""the amendment increased Grand River's escrow payment obligation in Arkansas from 
approximately $ 600,000, to over $ 6,000,000, for sales in 2005 alone."" "
872,1," Plaintiff devotes much of the Opposition to the assertion that the Court improperly applied the market participant analysis used 
in federal antitrust cases to Plaintiff's Cartwright Act claim. This assertion is tantamount to a request that the Court reconsider its 
March 3, 2009 ruling that Plaintiff's injury is too remote to support standing under the Cartwright Act. Plaintiff's request is 
improper because Plaintiff has already litigated the issue of standing under the Cartwright Act. See Sequa Corp. v. GBJ Corp., 
156 F.3d 136, 144 (2d Cir. 1998) (internal quotations and citations omitted) (A motion for reconsideration is not proper ""for 
relitigating old issues, presenting the case under new theories, securing a rehearing on the merits, or otherwise taking a second 
bite at the apple.""); FDIC v. Jackson-Shaw Partners No. 46, Ltd., 850 F. Supp. 839, 845 (N.D. Cal. 1994) (Motions for 
reconsideration ""are not to be used to test new legal theories that could have been presented when the original motion was 
pending.""). Plaintiff's request is also procedurally improper because Plaintiff filed the FAC rather than a request for 
reconsideration  [*13] of the Court's decision dismissing the Cartwright Act claim in the original complaint for lack of standing. "
890,1," The court recited the allegations of plaintiffs' amended complaints (Docs. 418, 420, 422, 448) at length in Chocolate I, 
familiarity with which is presumed. The court will recount facts alleged in the complaints only insofar as necessary to dispose of 
the Rule 12(b)(2) defendants' jurisdictional challenges."
890,2," Capital repatriation refers to the process  [**33] by which a corporation transfers an asset from one country to another and 
revalues it using the transferee nation's currency. See JOHN DOWNES, BARRON'S FINANCIAL GUIDES: DICTIONARY OF 
FINANCE AND INVESTMENT TERMS 580 (7th ed. 2006). "
891,3," The DreamWorks and Unilever agreements consist of an original licensing contract and several addenda. The court will cite 
these documents by paragraph number followed by the last four digits of the Bates stamp identifier on the page(s) that contains 
the cited provisions."
891,4," All monetary figures preceded by a dollar sign ($ ) appear in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted. Amounts preceded by a C 
reflect valuation in Canadian dollars."
891,5," Mars Canada corporate designee Mary Jane Dowling identified the American entity that purchased Mars Canada's products as 
""Snackfood"" or ""U.S. Snackfood,"" but she was unable to identify its precise legal name. (Doc. 622, Ex. 2 at 36.)"
891,6," As used in this memorandum, the terms ""Mars group,"" ""Nestle group,"" and ""Cadbury group,"" refer respectively to Mars Global, 
Nestle S.A., and Cadbury plc and all of their affiliated operating,  [**36] holding, and managing corporations regardless of 
whether the subsidiaries are parties to this action."
891,7," As used herein, the terms ""Mars entity,"" ""Nestle entity,"" or ""Cadbury entity"" refer to an indeterminate member of a particular 
corporate group regardless of whether it is a party to this action."
891,8," It is unclear whether a bright line separates the functions of Societe from those of Nestec. Hans Peter Frick (""Frick""), the 
corporate  [**38] designee for Nestle S.A., testified that Societe holds a ""large majority"" of patents for which Nestle S.A. is the 
beneficial owner. (Doc. 618, Ex. 2 at 21-22.) He later explained that Nestec--rather than Societe--serves as the custodian of the 
Nestle group's patent assets. (See Doc. 627, Ex. A P 12). Terrence J. Ellwood, Nestle Canada's corporate designee, testified "
892,," that Nestec rather than Societe owns many of the trademarks under which Nestle operating companies distribute products. 
(Doc. 619, Ex. 37 at 30, 182.) For purposes of this memorandum, it is sufficient to note that Societe and Nestec jointly administer 
the Nestle group's intellectual property assets."
892,9," A road show is a series of meetings or presentations during which corporate representatives meet with potential investors for 
the purpose of soliciting capital. See Credit Suisse Sec. (USA) LLC v. Billing, 551 U.S. 264, 270, 127 S. Ct. 2383, 168 L. Ed. 2d 
145 (2007)."
892,10," The record does not delineate the parameters that the Nestle group uses to distinguish strategic marks from other trademarks; 
however, it appears that strategic marks are those assigned to large families of products, such as Nescafe(R). (Doc. 618, Ex. 2 
at 61, 78.)"
892,11," The pet care SBU falls under the authority of an entity known as Nestle Purina Petcare Global Resources. (Doc. 627, Ex. A P 
13.) "
894,12," According to the Cadbury website, which the court independently  [**47] reviewed, the board of Cadbury plc has promulgated 
""terms of reference which define [the] roles and responsibilities"" of various committees within the Cadbury group. See Cadbury

894,13," The exhibits submitted by Cadbury plc and Cadbury Holdings contain three affidavits, each of which precede a series of 
alphabetically marked exhibits. The court will cite the affidavit of John Mills as Exhibit 1, the affidavit  [**49] of Jim Chambers as 
Exhibit 2, and the affidavit of Stacy Kaplan as Exhibit 3. The attachments to each affidavit will be identified as Exhibits 1A-1O, 
2A-2H, and 3A-3B, respectively."
894,14," Chambers testified as follows: Q. For people like you, who work in the business and run things day-to-day, do you have any understanding of the 
distinction [between Cadbury plc and Cadbury Holdings]? I'm not asking form a legal perspective, I'm asking from a 
practical perspective, between Cadbury Holdings Limited and Cadbury plc. A. No. (Doc. 620, Ex. 4 at 26-27.) "
895,15," The licensing agreements reflect a two-stage effort by the Cadbury group to exit the American chocolate candy market in the 
late 1980s. The first phase came on July 22, 1988 in the form of an asset purchase agreement between the predecessor of 
Hershey Global, Cadbury Schweppes plc, and Cadbury Schweppes, Inc., a Delaware corporation (hereinafter ""Cadbury 
Delaware""). (Doc. 478 at 14.) This agreement established terms for the transfer to Hershey Global of Cadbury-owned physical 
assets in the United States, including facilities, equipment, and inventory. (Doc. 478 at 12.) The agreement mandated that 
Hershey Global receive a license to manufacture and distribute Cadbury-branded products at the time of the closing. (Doc. 478-
2 §§ 3.1-.2, at 4.) The second phase of the Cadbury withdrawal occurred on  [**52] August 25, 1988, when the two licensing 
agreements were executed as required by the asset purchase contract. The first licensing agreement, executed between 
Hershey and an operating company known as Cadbury Limited, governed many products marketed under the Cadbury brand 
name, such as Caramello(R), Creme Eggs(R), and Dairy Milk(R) chocolate bars. (Doc. 620, Ex. 22 sched. A.) In early 2008, 
Cadbury Limited became Cadbury UK Limited, an operating company that presently supplies chocolate candy to the United 
Kingdom market. (Doc. 620, Ex. 3 at 69-70.) The second agreement, executed between Hershey Global and Cadbury Delaware, 
authorized Hershey Global to produce products marketed under the Peter Paul(R) and YorkTM brands. (Doc. 478-7 at 21-22.) 
Cadbury Schweppes plc was not a party to either of the trademark agreements."
895,16," Both agreements require Hershey Global to direct royalty payments to the contract signatory or the signatory's designate. 
(Doc. 478-8 § 5.1, at 12-13; Doc. 622, Ex. 22 § 5.1, at 36.) The record does not reflect the current designate(s)."
895,17," Jane Heathcock (""Heathcock"") and Trevour Kelleher (""Kelleher"") participated in these inspections on behalf of the Cadbury 
group. (Doc. 620, Exs. 25-26.) The record does not identify which Cadbury entity employs these individuals or the extent of their 
interaction with personnel then retained by Cadbury Schweppes."
895,18," Plaintiffs have submitted a total of fifteen quality review documents, some of which are duplicative. "
896,19," Eight employees of the Cadbury group attended this meeting. (Doc. 620, Ex. 23 at 1.) Three of these individuals, Bill Herbes, 
Leo Valle, and Ron Anderson, were members of the Cadbury Americas Confectionary business unit, which consists of all 
Cadbury operating entities in the United States and Canada. (Doc. 620, Ex. 4 at 155, 159-60.) Meeting minutes reflect that one 
individual, David Reilly, represented ""operations Canada."" (Doc. 620, Ex. 23 at 1.) One attendee, Stan Ainsley (""Ainsley""), 
 [**55] was originally employed in the U.K. by Cadbury Beverages Ltd. but had been seconded to the Americas Confectionary 
unit at the time of the meeting. (Doc. 620, Ex. 2 at 1.) The record does not indicate the affiliation of the other three attendees."
896,20," SKU, an acronym for ""Stock Keeping Unit,"" is a unique identification number assigned to products for purposes of inventory 
management. See Incase, Inc. v. Timex Corp., 488 F.3d 46, 50 n.2 (1st Cir. 2007)."
896,21," The court is aware of case law suggesting that plaintiff may not rely on the pleadings alone but must produce affidavits or 
other affirmative evidence to overcome a jurisdictional challenge under Rule 12(b)(2). See, e.g., Rodi v. S. New Eng. Sch. of "
897,," Law, 255 F. Supp. 2d 346, 348 (D.N.J. 2003). However, this misstates plaintiff's burden. If the moving party fails to submit 
evidence contravening the allegations of the complaint, the court is bound to accept plaintiff's allegations regardless of whether 
plaintiff presents further evidence in support thereof. See Miller Yacht Sales, Inc. v. Smith, 384 F.3d 93, 97 (3d Cir. 2004) 
(observing that, unless the court hears evidence on the jurisdictional issues, all allegations must be taken as true for purposes of 
assessing whether the plaintiff has established a prima facie case of jurisdiction); Carteret Sav. Bank, 954 F.2d at 142 n.1 
 [**59] (stating that the ""plaintiff need only plead [a] prima facie case to survive the initial [Rule 12(b)(2)] motion, but must 
eventually establish jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence""). In other words, although the burden of persuasion always 
lies with the non-moving party, the burden of production rests initially with the party moving for dismissal under Rule 12(b)(2)."
897,22," HN4[
] Section 12 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 22, permits nationwide service in antitrust cases, including those arising under the Sherman Act."
897,23," Plaintiffs briefly advocate specific jurisdiction over Mars Canada, Cadbury Holdings, and Cadbury plc. The court will address 
these arguments at infra notes 34 and 56. In their original briefs in opposition, they also argued that the court could exercise 
specific jurisdiction over the defendants under the stream-of-commerce theory and the effects test announced in Calder v. 
Jones, 465 U.S. 783, 104 S. Ct. 1482, 79 L. Ed. 2d 804 (1984). The former test grants jurisdiction when a defendant places a 
product into the stream of commerce and the product subsequently causes an in-forum injury. See Renner v. Lanard Toys Ltd., 
33 F.3d 277, 282-83 (3d Cir. 1994). The Calder effects test confers jurisdiction when a defendant's out-of-forum tortious activity 
produces foreseeable in-forum results. See Imo Indus. v. Kiekert AG, 155 F.3d 254, 265-66 (3d Cir. 1998). Plaintiffs have 
elected to relinquish these jurisdictional arguments against Mars Canada, (Doc. 621 at 23 n.11), and have not mentioned them 
in current filings against the remaining Rule 12(b)(2) defendants. Hence, the court concludes that plaintiffs no longer advocate 
 [**62] for jurisdiction under stream-of-commerce and Calder principles. "
898,24," The Third Circuit's recent decision in Metcalfe v. Renaissance Marine, Inc., 566 F.3d 324, 51 V.I. 1219 (3d Cir. 2009) 
demonstrates the continued validity of this principle. In Metcalfe, the defendant directly sold eleven powerboats along with ten-
year warranties to consumers in the Virgin Islands, a relatively small forum. The court held that defendant directly interacted with 
in-forum consumers for the purpose of furthering its core business activities and that this conduct, in light of the small forum size, 
established ""ongoing business relationships"" sufficient to subject it to general jurisdiction. Id. at 335. Accordingly,HN10[
]  
general jurisdiction depends not on the mere quantity of contacts that defendant has with the forum but upon whether it engages 
in forum-related activity with the purpose of ""preserv[ing] and enlarg[ing] an active . . . market"" in the forum. Id. (quoting 
Hendrickson v. Reg O Co., 657 F.2d 9, 15 (3d Cir. 1981)). "
899,25," Defendant Mars Canada relies upon Turan v. Universal Plan Inv. Ltd., 70 F. Supp. 2d 671, 675 (E.D. La. 1999), and Henry v. 
Offshore Drilling Pty., Ltd., 331 F. Supp. 340, 343 (E.D. La. 1971), for the proposition that alter ego jurisdiction applies only to 
foreign parents that exercise control over affiliated entities within the forum. (Doc. 628 at 10). The court has identified no 
controlling Third Circuit precedent addressing this issue; however, our sister courts have consistently exercised alter ego 
jurisdiction over ""either the parent or the subsidiary based upon the other's connections to the forum."" Simeone, 360 F. Supp. 2d 
at 675 (emphasis added); accord Chocolate I, 602 F. Supp. 2d at 570; Oeschle v. Pro-Tech Power, Inc., No. 03-CV-6875, 2006 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10223, 2006 WL 680908, at *5 (E.D. Pa. Mar. 15, 2006); Directory Dividends, Inc. v. SBC Commc'ns, Inc., No. 
01-CV-1974, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12214, 2003 WL 21961448, at *3 (E.D. Pa. July 2, 2003); Zwick v. Revco Drug Store, 580 F. 
Supp. 64, 66 (W.D. Pa. 1984); Aamco Automatic Transmissions, Inc. v. Tayloe, 368 F. Supp. 1283, 1300 (E.D. Pa. 1973). This 
broader formulation reflects the common-sense principle that HN13[
] the court should not defer to corporate boundaries that 
the  [**69] defendant itself has disregarded. When two organizations assume alter ego status, they effectively operate as a 
single, unified entity notwithstanding the superficial corporate boundaries between them. The consolidated entity is subject to 
jurisdiction in any forum where it operates regardless of which formal corporation maintains an in-forum presence. Courts 
commonly exercise alter ego jurisdiction over a foreign parent based upon its control of an in-forum subsidiary, but reversal of 
the entities' geographic placement does not restrict the application of alter ego principles. "
900,26," Mars Global owns approximately 38% of Mars Canada's stock and controls the remainder through other Mars subsidiaries. 
(Doc. 622, Ex. 2 at 70-72; Doc. 622, Exs. 19, 33.)"
900,27," An entity known as the Mars American Treasury and Benefits Center (""ATBC"") occasionally participates in the dividend 
payment and repatriation process. The ATBC is  [**72] an American entity within the Mars group that provides financial support, 
tax consultation, and cash management to Mars entities within the United States. (Doc. 622, Ex. 2 at 93.) It sporadically advises 
Mars Canada, but this interaction is limited because ATBC personnel lack expertise in Canadian law and tax regulations. (Id. at 
94.) As the ATBC functions primarily in the United States for the benefit of domestic Mars entities, its participation in dividend 
and repatriation processes is of relatively little import in the alter ego analysis. "
901,28," Amarillo Oil Co. v. Mapco, Inc. illustrates that centralized accounting and finance policies do not create an alter ego 
relationship. In Amarillo Oil, plaintiffs filed a diversity suit against an out-of-forum parent but did not join its local subsidiary. 
Defendants moved to dismiss on the ground that the subsidiary was an indispensable party. 99 F.R.D. at 603. Plaintiffs 
responded that the subsidiary constituted an alter ego of the parent and that its technical joinder was therefore unnecessary. Id. 
They also urged the court to disregard its citizenship for diversity purposes and to rely exclusively upon the citizenship of its 
alleged alter ego parent. Id. They argued, inter alia, that the two corporations had consolidated accounting functions within the 
parent organization.  [**74] The court rebuffed plaintiffs' argument, noting that ""[c]entralized accounting services for a parent and 
its subsidiaries is a common feature of the modern corporate landscape"" and does not alone reflect the type of pervasive 
corporate control essential to an alter ego relationship. Id. at 606. The subsidiary owned its own land and fungible assets, 
elected its own directors (which were identical to those of its parent), and maintained contractual relationships independent of its 
parent. Id. In the present matter, Mars Canada has a similar relationship with Mars Global. Although the two corporations share 
certain finance and accounting policies, Mars Canada oversees operations, sells products, and holds real estate without 
participation from Mars Global."
901,29," These brands include Maltesers(R), which are bite-size malt-flavored spheres covered in chocolate, and Bounty(R), a 
chocolate bar with a coconut center. (Doc. 628, Ex. 3 P 13); see also Mars Canada - Our Brands, http://www.mars.com 
/Canada/en/Our+brands.htm (last visited Aug. 6, 2009). The company also manufactures a line of Dove products called Dove 
Promises(R), whose wrappers contain  [**76] epigrams similar to those found in fortune cookies. (Doc. 628, Ex. 3 P 14.)"
901,30," During Dowling's deposition, plaintiffs' counsel asked her which corporation ""would trump"" the other in the event that the two 
could not agree. (Doc. 622, Ex. 2 at 84; see also id. at 93, 151.) Dowling explained that such a situation has never arisen but 
speculated that Mars Global could require Mars Canada to act if it  [**77] chose to do so. (Id. at 84, 96, 151-52.) Such 
hypothetical guesswork receives little weight in the court's jurisdictional analysis because it does not reflect the pragmatic 
relationship between the two corporations, which has never required Mars Global to mandate a payment over Mars Canada's 
objection. Dowling stated that the two entities negotiate a financial transfer consistent with both entities' objectives. "
902,," Plaintiffs also rely upon a $ 75 million redemption of Mars Canada shares in June 2006 to establish an alter ego relationship. 
(Doc. 622, Ex. 18.) Plaintiffs contend that ""Mars Canada's directors played no role in determining the price of the stock 
redemption"" during which Mars Canada transferred funds to a subsidiary of Mars Global. (Doc. 621.) Dowling, however, 
explained that this transfer--like all dividends and capital repatriations--was the subject of negotiation by Mars Canada and Mars 
Global. She stated that Mars Canada's treasurer ""jointly determined"" the value of the transaction with Mars Global and that Mars 
Global exercised the ""final say."" (Doc. 622, Ex. 2 at 77; see also id. at 79.) She further explained that the transaction was 
negotiated through the bargaining  [**78] process typical of capital repatriations between Mars Canada and Mars Global. (Id. at 
81-82.) A collaborative transfer of capital does not demonstrate draconian parental control sufficient to establish alter ego status. 
See Action Mfg., 375 F. Supp. 2d at 425 (refusing to exercise alter ego jurisdiction despite parent's involvement in setting the 
timing of dividends paid by subsidiary); accord Bestfoods, 524 U.S. at 72 (1998). "
903,31," Dowling testified that Mars Canada ""owns all its own trademarks in Canada."" (Doc. 622, Ex. 2 at 125; accord Doc. 628, Ex. 2 
P 17.) Thus, the company's participation is likely necessary in any Canadian licensing deal involving Mars-branded products. 
The DreamWorks and Unilever contracts exemplify this. Mars entities in the U.S. prepared both contracts, the geographic scope 
of which was originally limited to the United States. Mars Canada ratified the agreements only when the signatories sought to 
extend the trademark license to Canada. (Doc. 622, Ex. 12 at 1596; Doc. 622, Ex. 13 recitals, at 1649.)"
903,32," One agreement contains a choice-of-law provision applying Delaware law, but it does not specify a forum in which the 
signatories must litigate disputes. (Doc. 622, Ex. 11 P 16.) The second agreement grants the courts of New York non-exclusive 
jurisdiction to hear contract  [**83] claims, (Doc. 622, Ex. 12 P 13, at 1591), and the third agreement requires that suits be filed 
in California federal or state court, (Doc. 622, Ex. 13 P 11.3, at 1628 & attach. C P 12.3, at 1645)."
903,33," Mars Canada traveled to the U.S. on more than 700 occasions between 2001 and 2008, resulting in an average of 
approximately eighty-five trips per year. (Doc. 622,  [**85] Ex. 16.)"
903,34," Plaintiffs assert that the court may exercise specific jurisdiction over Mars Canada based upon the transfer of chocolate 
products to Mars Snackfood at wholesale prices established by the Finance Manual. (Doc. 621 at 23-24.) A court may exercise 
specific jurisdiction over a claim that is related to the defendant's contacts with the forum. HN18[
] The plaintiff must 
demonstrate that the lawsuit is the foreseeable consequence of the defendant's forum-centered action. O'Connor v. Sandy Lane "
904,," Hotel Co., 496 F.3d 312, 323 (3d Cir. 2007). ""The link between the defendant's action and the plaintiff's claim need not rise to 
the level  [**86] of proximate causation, but the connection must be 'intimate enough to keep the quid pro quo [between in-forum 
activity and jurisdictional exposure] proportional and personal jurisdiction7 reasonably foreseeable.'"" Chocolate I, 602 F. Supp. 
2d at 558 (alteration in original) (quoting O'Connor, 496 F.3d at 323). In this case, plaintiffs allege that Mars Canada charged 
Mars Snackfood prices that allowed Mars Snackfood to ""achieve a greater profit margin on the chocolate products at issue in 
this case, particularly when anti-competitive conduct is present."" (Doc. 621 at 24.) Plaintiffs' argument stretches the quid pro quo 
between the transfer of products and specific jurisdiction too thin. Mars Canada sold no chocolate products to American 
consumers, and it exercised no control over the prices Mars Snackfood charged in the U.S. market. Instead, Mars Canada acts 
as a remote wholesaler whose pricing power ends when its products leave the warehouse. HN19[
] ""A plaintiff cannot hold a 
manufacturer liable for a price-fixing harm occurring after the product left the manufacturer's hands absent a showing that the 
manufacturer retained control over product pricing."" Chocolate I, 602 F. Supp. 2d at 560;  [**87] accord Pinker, 292 F.3d at 368 
(reiterating that specific jurisdiction requires that the plaintiff's claim ""relate[] to or arise[] out of the defendant's contacts with the 
forum""); Patent Incentives, Inc. v. Seiko Epson Corp., No. Civ.A. 88-1407, 1988 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9933, 1988 WL 92460, at *5 
(D.N.J. Sept. 6, 1988) (refusing to exercise specific jurisdiction over a patent infringement suit against a defendant that shipped 
products into the forum because the plaintiff's claim was unrelated to the distribution activity). Under the circumstances of this 
case, subjecting Mars Canada to American antitrust law when it exercises no pricing authority in the U.S. would be 
fundamentally inequitable."
904,35," Plaintiffs argue that Nestle S.A.'s Articles of Association authorize it to assume omnipotent control over subsidiary 
corporations. The Articles allow Nestle S.A. to ""participate in"" the activities of the Nestle group, (Doc. 618, Ex. 1 art. 2(1)), and 
confer upon its board the non-delegable responsibility for ""the ultimate direction of the business of Nestle,"" (id. art. 18(a)). 
According to Frick, Swiss law prohibits the board from transferring this duty to a third party. (Doc. 618, Ex. 2 at 144.) Nestle 
S.A.'s Articles of Association provide a point of reference for the jurisdictional analysis but do not dictate its outcome, which 
depends upon Nestle S.A.'s daily business relationships with its affiliated corporations. "
905,36," Assuming arguendo that Nestle S.A. directly controlled Nestec and Societe, their trademark licensing activities would be 
insufficient to establish alter ego jurisdiction. Nestle USA's licensing agreements are incidental to its status as the exclusive 
distributor of Nestle-branded merchandise in the United States, and the mere presence of contractual ties between two related 
corporations does not meld into them a single entity. Financial benefits ordinarily flow from subsidiary corporations to their 
 [**91] parents. That some of those benefits pass from Nestle USA to Nestle S.A. in the form of royalties rather than dividends 
sheds little light on the control that Nestle S.A. exercises over Nestle USA's operational affairs. See, e.g., In re Lupron(R) Mktg. 
& Sales Practices Litig., 245 F. Supp. 2d 280, 290-92 (D. Mass. 2003) (rejecting alter ego as a means of acquiring jurisdiction 
over a foreign parent who received royalty payments from an in-forum subsidiary); Seltzer Sister Bottling Co. v. Source Perrier 
S.A., No. C-90-1468, 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18206, 1991 WL 279273, at *4 (N.D. Cal. May 1, 1991) (declining to exercise alter 
ego jurisdiction over a parent whose subsidiary held trademark licenses from an affiliated entity but had no direct contractual 
relationship with the parent). "
906,37," Plaintiffs claim that a September 2006 investor seminar led by Lars Olofsson (""Olofsson""), then head of SBUs and the SGDU, 
demonstrates that ""Nestle S.A. purposefully directs its management of operations across corporate lines . . . including as to 
management of  [**95] 'pricing' the 'Nestle Way.'"" (Doc. 617 at 7.) Olofsson's written materials span forty-three pages, most of 
which describe product-placement and market-growth efforts. The presentation devotes a scant two pages to pricing strategy. 
(Doc. 618, Ex. 8 at 40.) The first of these pages contains the following phrases, which form an acronym for the word price: 
""Perceived consumer value,"" ""Review the '5Cs,'"" ""Integrate marketing mix,"" ""Cross-functional,"" and ""Evaluate constantly."" (Id.) 
The documents do not illustrate how these factors affect pricing. The second page is no more self-explanatory than the first. The 
phrases ""From 'Cost +'"" and ""To 'Consumer Value Based Pricing'"" appear in the heading and are joined by a right-facing arrow 
pointing from the first phrase to the second. (Id. at 41.) Several photos of Nestle products are placed beneath this heading and 
accompanied by a table of plus (+) and equal (=) signs that apparently reflect profit margins on the pictured items. (Id.) Below 
the table, products are then coupled with consumer shibboleth. For instance, the phrases ""Foamier Convenience"" and ""Just Like 
Human Food"" accompany Nescafe(R) Cappuccino and Beneful(R) dog food products,  [**96] respectively. (Id.) Obviously 
marketing monikers and whimsical slogans do not constitute the monolithic pricing structure that plaintiffs postulate. These slides reflect a change in the Nestle group's pricing strategy announced in late 2005 or early 2006 by Edward Marra 
(""Marra""), Olofsson's predecessor. During a June 2005 investor presentation, Marra explained that the newly created SGDU 
model sought to change pricing formulae from arithmetical mark-up percentages to strategies that aligned prices with 
consumers' perception of product value. (Doc. 618, Ex. 11 at 9.) Hence, products designed to impart an image of sophistication 
would receive a greater mark-up than those directed toward more functional ends. (Id.) The record does not contain a copy of 
the SGDU pricing policy or explain how it ultimately determined prices, and Marra's comments provide the sole elucidation of the 
revised pricing protocol. It is unclear whether Nestle USA fully implemented the policy shift that Marra espoused, and Frick 
explained that while the SGDU developed this policy, neither it nor Nestle S.A. participate in subsidiaries' daily pricing decisions. 
(Doc. 618, Ex. 2 at 239.) The SGDU provided ""some guidelines  [**97] and best practices"" about implementation new pricing 
strategies, but ultimate supervision of product lines remained the task of the operating entities. (Doc. 618, Ex. 15 at 21.) Both Marra's presentation and Frick's statements confirm that the Nestec SGDU did not usurp the role of pricing from operating 
subsidiaries. Marra's seminar primarily focused upon the SGDU's ""approach on sales and marketing, [also known as] . . . 
strategic demand generation."" (Doc. 618, Ex. 11 at 2.) Most of the presentation recapitulated recent product rollouts and focused 
upon future innovation. A meager three paragraphs of the thirteen-page program transcript address pricing. Marra briefly 
explained that the SGDU was ""giv[ing] our generating demand people around the world the processes, the tools and the training 
so that they can more effectively plan their pricing strategies"" within individual operating companies. (Id. at 7 (emphasis added)). 
The quoted passage suggests that the SGDU was designed to advise operating entities but not control them. Such activity is 
akin to the consultation and support that parent corporations routinely provide subsidiaries and is insufficient to convert Nestle 
USA into a drone  [**98] of Nestle S.A. See Bestfoods, 524 U.S. at 72; Quarles, 504 F.2d at 1363; In re Lupron(R), 245 F. 
Supp. 2d at 290-92. The court notes that plaintiffs have forsaken any argument of specific jurisdiction over Nestle S.A. based upon the 
implementation of pricing guidelines. (See Doc. 617 at 7 (discussing Nestle S.A.'s pricing policy in the context of alter ego 
jurisdiction)). The court expresses no opinion regarding whether corporate pricing guidelines, in any context, may satisfy a 
minimum contacts analysis for purposes of a § 1 claim. "
907,38," Plaintiffs rely upon In re Genetically Modified Rice Litigation, 576 F. Supp. 2d 1063 (E.D. Mo. 2008),  [**102] which involved a 
foreign parent corporation that discharged certain management functions, such as establishing general policy, providing advice 
to its subsidiaries, and integrating financial structures across corporate boundaries. Id. at 1068. Unlike Nestle S.A., it exercised 
significantly greater daily authority over its subsidiary. The parent and subsidiary had executed an agreement under which the 
subsidiary agreed to ""subordinate[] the management of its company"" to the parent, which was ""entitled to give instruction to [the 
subsidiary's] Board of Directors regarding the management of the company."" Id. at 1075. In sharp contrast, Nestle USA 
manages its own facilities and develops its own corporate strategy. It has implemented independent SBUs and SGDU to cater to 
American consumers. Nestle S.A. collects financial data and receives profits from Nestle USA, but the American company "
908,," controls its own functional operations on a daily basis. Accordingly, Genetically Modified Rice provides no ready analogy for the 
relationship that exists between Nestle USA and Nestle S.A."
908,39," The record contains little information regarding the daily tasks that the RIPAs perform. RIPAs advise on trademark issues, 
(Doc. 618, Ex. 2 at 48), and ""manage"" certain local brands, (Doc. 618, Ex. 23 at 33), but it is unclear whether they register new 
trademarks, prosecute  [**105] enforcement litigation, monitor the market for infringing products, or perform other functions 
integral to the protection of the Nestle group's marks."
908,40," Two of these events occured in New York with additional events taking place in Boston and the Napa Valley. Nestle S.A. travel 
records confirm that CEO Paul Bulcke entered the United States through the Boston Airport on February 26, 2008 for a road 
show event and departed from Los Angeles on March 2, 2008 after visiting Nestle USA's facility located in Glendale, California. 
(Doc. 618, Ex. 21 at rows 193-94.)"
908,41," Former CEO Peter Brabeck conducted the three road show presentations in March 2007. (Doc. 618, Ex. 21 at rows 136-38; 
Doc. 619, Ex. 41.) "
909,42," For instance, the Gerber(R) acquisition was a $ 5.5 billion deal, (Doc. 618, Ex. 29 at 25), and the Dreyer's(R) transaction was 
valued in excess of $ 2 billion, (Doc. 618, Ex. 31 at 33.)"
909,43," Plaintiffs' evidence of these transactions consists of several PowerPoint presentations prepared by the Nestle group that tout 
their financial benefits but refer to the acquiring entity merely as ""Nestle."" These presentations are promotional in nature. They 
do not identify the structure of the acquisitions or describe the manner in which the transactions were negotiated. This 
 [**108] deficiency is fatal to plaintiffs' argument. In essence, plaintiffs ask the court to presume that Nestle S.A. took part in 
these transactions without clear, corroborative evidence. Nestle S.A. may have directly participated in these acquisitions, but it is 
equally likely that Nestle S.A. incorporated an acquisition subsidiary to negotiate and implement their terms. If it did so, plaintiffs 
would be required to establish an alter ego relationship between Nestle S.A. and the subsidiary before imputing the acquisition 
to the parent entity. Lucas, 666 F.2d at 805-06; Action Mfg. Co., 375 F. Supp. 2d at 420; supra Part III.A.2. The characterization 
of the acquiring entity as ""Nestle"" is therefore unhelpful to the jurisdictional analysis. The court previously cautioned against such 
assumptions because they ""disadvantage[] plaintiffs when responding to the Rule 12(b)(2) motions, which require that plaintiffs 
establish personal jurisdiction as to each particular corporate defendant."" Chocolate I, 602 F. Supp. 2d at 559 n.17. In the 
present proceeding, plaintiffs could have submitted relevant portions of the merger agreements or deposed appropriate 
corporate officers about the manner in which  [**109] the transactions occurred, but they have not done so. Without such 
evidence, plaintiffs cannot establish that Nestle S.A. directly participated in these transactions. Based upon the record sub 
judice, the merger activity receives relatively little weight in the court's jurisdictional analysis."
909,44," This figure includes nine acquisitions between 1984 and 2003, (Doc. 618, Ex. 26 at 6), and the Novartis and Gerber(R) 
transactions identified in plaintiffs' brief, (Doc. 617 at 22). The court has excluded the 1973 acquisition of Stouffer's(R), which 
occurred more than a decade before all other transactional activity, and the 2002 deal involving Dreyer's(R), which was handled 
by Nestle Holdings."
909,45," Five of these transactions potentially occurred within the putative class period, which runs from December 9, 2002 to at least 
December 20, 2007. (Doc. 418 P 37; Doc. 420 P 67; Doc. 422 P 27.) During this period, the Nestle group divested two entities 
 [**111] (Ortega(R) and Flipz & Wonderball) in 2002 and one entity (Cross & Blackwell(R)) in 2003. (Doc. 618, Ex. 26 at 6.) It 
also acquired Gerber(R) and Novartis in 2007. "
910,46," Plaintiff analogize Nestle S.A. to the defendant in Shepherd Investments Int'l v. Verizon Communications, Inc., 373 F. Supp. 
2d 853 (E.D. Wis. 2005). In Shepherd Investments, the court invoked general jurisdiction over a foreign holding company that 
engaged in promotional activities and investor relations in the forum. Defendant also participated in activities that, unlike Nestle 
S.A., approximated a business presence in the forum. Defendant sold its stock directly to forum residents through an interactive 
website. Id. at 864. It augmented these direct sales by establishing business relationships with approximately 140 domestic 
banks, through which it paid regular dividends. Id. It also initiated and intervened in lawsuits, urged residents to contact their 
legislative representatives to advocate certain policies, and maintained a lobbying presence in the forum state's capital. Id. at 
865-66. Nestle S.A. has not engaged in such activity; therefore, Shepherd Investments is factually distinguishable."
910,47," Plaintiffs also seek to assign jurisdiction over Nestle Canada based upon contacts that David Mullins, its head of purchasing, 
maintains with Nestle Business Services. Their reliance upon  [**115] Mullins's activity is simply an iteration of the argument that 
importation of raw materials into Canada confers jurisdiction. As previously noted, this activity does not give rise to general 
jurisdiction. Helicopteros, 466 U.S. at 417; Wilson, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16714, 2009 WL 532830, at *8 HN23[
] (""[M]ere 
purchases . . . cannot establish sufficient systematic and continuous contacts for general jurisdiction.""). "
911,48," Nestle Canada personnel travel to the United States for two distinct purposes. First, staff who manage Nestle Canada's 
confectionary productions periodically enter the U.S. to attend strategic conferences on ""the future of chocolate."" (Doc. 619, Ex. 
37 at 35.) Second, personnel within Nestle Canada's nutrition division ""report . . . into the US nutrition business"" and travel to the 
United States to further this relationship. (Id. at 34.) The record does not describe the reasons for this travel and reflects only 
that the division imports power bars and other nutritional products from the United States for sale to consumers in Canada. (Id. 
at 190-91.) Presumably, travel by its personnel occurs to effectuate these purposes. The court finds that this travel is akin to the 
inventory-supply activity found inadequate to establish jurisdiction  [**117] in Helicopteros and Rosenberg Brothers."
911,49," Plaintiffs contend that Nestle Canada has an agent for service of process in the United States. The factual record reveals that 
Nestle Globe, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Nestle Canada, maintains this agent. (Doc. 619, Ex. 37 at 175.) Plaintiffs have 
not established that these two entities are alter egos of one another, and the court will not consider Nestle Globe's contacts with 
the U.S. in the jurisdictional analysis against Nestle Canada."
911,50," In light of the dismissal of Mars Canada, Nestle S.A., and Nestle Canada, the motions to dismiss (Docs. 469, 476) plaintiffs' 
amended complaints under Rule 12(b)(6) will be denied as moot with respect to these defendants."
911,51," Joint consideration of Cadbury plc and Cadbury Holdings is also appropriate because they coordinate all of their corporate 
activities and function as a unified parent entity. Cadbury plc discharges the Cadbury group's financial reporting requirements 
while Cadbury Holdings manages its operating subsidiaries. These activities complement one another, and Chambers testified 
that the two entities operate as a single indistinguishable entity on a daily basis. Consequently, the court may consider them as 
one organization notwithstanding the corporate lines that separate them."
911,52," not a party to the actions before the court; however, HN25[
] a plaintiff seeking to acquire alter ego jurisdiction over a foreign 
parent need not join its domestic subsidiary to the action. See Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft v. Beech Aircraft Corp., 751 
F.2d 117, 119, 122-23 (2d Cir. 1984) (opining that alter ego jurisdiction existed over foreign party corporation by virtue of its 
control of a nonparty subsidiary); Bellomo v. Pa. Life Co., 488 F. Supp. 744, 746-47 (S.D.N.Y. 1980) (exercising agency 
jurisdiction over an out-of-forum parent based upon the forumrelated activities of its non-party subsidiaries). The alter ego 
relationship effectively places the parent within the forum, rendering formal joinder of the subsidiary unnecessary. "
912,53," It is unclear whether the American Confectionary division is a distinct corporate entity or whether the term merely refers to all 
Cadbury confectionary-producing entities in the United States and Canada. Chambers testified that he joined the Cadbury group 
in 2005 as the ""CEO of Americas Confectionery,""  [**121] (Doc. 620, Ex. 4 at 9); however, a subsequent affidavit avers that his 
employer was Cadbury USA, (Doc. 629, Ex. 2 P 4). During his deposition, he explained that ""Americas Confectionery was the 
internal organization name for the Americas Region in the Confectionery side of the business."" (Doc. 620, Ex. 4 at 15.) Prior to 
2008, Americas Confectionary consisted of three regions: South America, northern Latin America, and North America. (Id. at 
46.) Each of these regions had a president who reported directly to Chambers. In 2008, the division was reshaped and currently 
comprises five smaller regions, to wit: the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean. (Id. at 47.) It is unclear 
whether a separate subsidiary corporation operates in each of these regions or whether such entities--if they exist--scrupulously 
observe corporate boundaries. Similar confusion persists regarding the recruitment and assignment of employees within the Cadbury group. For example, Todd 
Stitzer, the CEO of Cadbury plc, is ""actually employed by [a] US company and then second[ed to] . . . Cadbury Holdings."" (Doc. 
620, Ex. 3 at 17 (emphasis added)). Indeed, most CEC members are employed by Cadbury operating  [**122] entities despite 
their participation in the global management functions of the CEC. Employees often transfer from one Cadbury entity to another 
based upon the Committee's recommendations. Chambers explained that ""the [HR recruitment function] works kind of 
[amorphously], in terms of business unit to business unit. . . . [T]he supply pool [of personnel] . . . is cultivated by the HR 
community . . . across all of the entities that . . . make up Cadbury."" (Doc. 620, Ex. 4 at 205.) The Cadbury group's centralized 
management of territory and personnel provide prima facie evidence that Cadbury corporate boundaries are superimposed 
purlieus that do not reflect functional accountabilities within the corporate group. Cadbury plc and Cadbury Holdings's request 
that the court defer to corporate parameters is unpersuasive in light of record evidence that defendants themselves failed to 
accord those lines the same respect."
912,54, Chambers testified as follows: Q. How many members are on the board of directors of Cadbury Adams USA? A. I don't know exactly. 
913,," Q. Approximately? A. Half-a-dozen. Q . Do you know who they are? A. I couldn't list them all, no. Q . Can you list any of them? A. Not with certainty, no. Q. Have you ever  [**125] met with the board of directors of Cadbury Adams USA? A. We have had meetings or documents that would act as a meeting, to come to an agreement on issues. Q . You're talking about something that was done on a paper basis, correct? A . That's part of what I'm referring to, yes. Q. Have you ever had an in-person meeting with the board of directors of Cadbury Adams USA? A. I don't recall. Q. Have you ever participated in a telephonic meeting with members of the board of directors of Cadbury Adams USA? A. I don't recall. (Doc. 620, Ex. 4 at 93-94.)"
913,55," Following his deposition, Chambers executed an affidavit identifying the members of Cadbury USA's board as himself, Brad 
Irwin, Gary Lyons, and James Reed. (Doc. 629, Ex. 2 P 4.) He also enumerated four board meetings and ten written consents in 
which he participated. (Id. P 3; Doc. 629, Ex. 2A.) These late-breaking recollections are insufficient to countermand Chambers's 
description of the centralized control that the CEC exercises over Cadbury USA. Chambers expressed familiarity with Reed 
during his deposition, and Lyons, who is Cadbury USA's general counsel, was physically present during his testimony. (Doc. 
620, Ex. 4 at 2, 204.) Chambers's failure  [**126] to identify these individuals as board members despite professional 
relationships with them underscores the board's lack of operational control. "
914,56," In light of plaintiffs' showing of an alter ego relationship, the court need not consider whether Cadbury plc and Cadbury 
Holdings possess systematic and continuous contacts with the United States or whether they are otherwise subject to the court's 
specific jurisdiction."
914,57," Retaining Cadbury plc and Cadbury Holdings while dismissing the remaining Rule 12(b)(2) defendants is consistent with 
recent Third Circuit pronouncements applying the doctrine of general jurisdiction. D'Jamoos ex rel. Estate of Weingeroff v. 
Pilatus Aircraft Ltd., 566 F.3d 94 (3d Cir. 2009), illustrates that HN26[
] purposeful engagement of in-forum residents is 
essential to the exercise of general  [**128] jurisdiction. In D'Jamoos, plaintiff brought suit against a Swiss corporation engaged 
in the production of aircraft. Id. at 98. The manufacturer maintained a stateside subsidiary, which acted as its exclusive 
distributor in the United States, performed final manufacturing work on aircraft sold here, and performed research and 
development functions for the foreign parent. Id. at 98, 107-08. The parent incorporated alterations designed by the subsidiary 
into new versions of its aircraft, and approximately half of the parent's total revenue derived from the subsidiary's sales in the 
U.S. Id. at 108. The Third Circuit held that the parent's activity constituted a mutual, ongoing business relationship with the 
subsidiary in the forum: The parent supplied the subsidiary with a steady stream of aircraft; the subsidiary's ""raison d'etre [was] 
'to provide completions, marketing, sales, and service for [the parent]."" Id. The parent engaged primarily in manufacturing 
activity; the subsidiary provided a considerable outlet for its products and a platform to research product improvements. 
Moreover, the subsidiary acted as the final artery through which the parent channeled its products to American 
 [**129] consumers. The Third Circuit concluded that the parent was the subsidiary's sole ""source of life,"" and that its activities 
amounted to the business of the parent. Id. at 109. Mars Global and Nestle S.A. do not exercise such extensive control over Mars Canada and Nestle USA. Both of these 
subsidiaries manage their own operations and develop marketing campaigns for local markets. The parent entities advise and 
monitor subsidiary performance but do not manufacture products or inject their presence into daily operational affairs. In 
contrast, Cadbury plc and Cadbury Holdings exercise sweeping control over their subsidiaries through the CEC. The Committee, 
comprised of the heads of business units, directly manages production and product development. Cadbury operating entities 
therefore draw life from their corporate parent in a manner not shared by their Mars and Nestle counterparts, and D'Jamoos 
bolsters the court's dismissal of the latter entities while exercising jurisdiction over Cadbury plc and Cadbury Holdings."
914,58," HN28[
] Considerations  [**131] of fairness and substantial justice typically arise in the context of specific jurisdiction, and 
the Supreme Court has never expressly applied them to the general jurisdiction analysis. 4 Charles ALAN WRIGHT & ARTHUR 
R. MILLER, FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE, § 1067.5, at 521-23 (3d ed. 2002). Nonetheless, several courts of 
appeals have instructed that such factors properly bear on the issue of general jurisdiction and the court will therefore assess 
them in this case. Id.; see also Trierweiler v. Croxton & Trench Holding Corp., 90 F.3d 1523, 1532-33 (10th Cir. 1996); Metro. 
Life Ins. Co. v. Robertson-Ceco Corp., 84 F.3d 560, 568, 573 (2d Cir. 1996); Amoco Egypt Oil Co. v. Leonis Navigation Co., 1

915,59," Cadbury plc and Cadbury Holdings have filed three motions (Docs. 464, 469, 476) to dismiss plaintiffs amended complaints for 
failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The court considered the arguments raised therein when ruling upon 
the Rule 12(b)(6) motions of the defendants that did not contest personal jurisdiction. The court will deny Cadbury plc and 
Cadbury Holdings's Rule 12(b)(6) motions for reasons identical to those set forth in Chocolate I. See 602 F. Supp. 2d at 574-58. "
931,1," This order does not address defendants' motion to dismiss plaintiffs' European Union claims (Doc. # 915); the motions to

motion regarding the European Union claims; the individual defendants' additional bases for dismissal (Doc. # 1019), to which 
plaintiffs have not yet responded; or plaintiffs' motion for oral argument on those issues (Doc. # 996). Those motions remain

] With respect specifically to antitrust claims, the Court, in reviewing the practical significance of this ""entitlement"" requirement of Rule 8, stated that ""it is one thing to be cautious before dismissing an antitrust complaint in advance of discovery, 
but quite another to forget that proceeding to antitrust discovery can be expensive.""  [**25] See id. at 558 (citation omitted). "
935,3," The Court assumes that it has subject matter jurisdiction over the European law claims only for the purposes of these motions, 
pending resolution of defendants' other motions to dismiss those claims."
935,4," The two separate direct action complaints at issue here contain the same substantive allegations  [**34] regarding defendants' 
liability, differing only with respect to the particular plaintiffs involved in each suit. "
936,5," This division of years is not simply a creation of defendants in arguing the motions to dismiss. In their complaints, in claiming 
fraudulent concealment, plaintiffs allege that they could not have known about their 1999-2004 claims until November 2004; and 
that they could not have known about their 1994-1998 claims until December 2007, when they learned from a cooperating 
conspirator, with whom they have settled their claims, that the conspiracy extended back to 1994.  [**39] Plaintiffs did not 
include the latter allegation, however, as a basis to support their conspiracy allegations in the complaint; nor did plaintiffs include 
any facts learned from that conspirator that could support that the existence of a conspiracy prior to 1999. "
937,6," Plaintiffs cite In re TFT-LCD (Flat Panel) Antitrust Litigation, 599 F. Supp. 2d 1179, 1185 (N.D. Cal. 2009),  [**40] in which the 
court rejected the defendants' argument that the plaintiffs had not alleged facts to support a plausible inference of 
anticompetitive conduct before a particular date within the alleged conspiracy. That case is clearly distinguishable. In TFT, the 
court found that the complaints did include specific allegations about the early time period. See id. No such specific allegations 
are present in this case. The parties have not pointed the court to any other case in which the defendant attempted to carve out 
a portion of the alleged conspiracy period in this manner. "
938,7," Plaintiffs have also alleged that defendants' conspiracy was self-concealing, and they suggest in a footnote in their opposition 
brief, without argument, that the Tenth Circuit would adopt a self-concealing standard and permit such an allegation to support 
tolling of the limitations period. In King & King, the Tenth Circuit noted that the Temporary Emergency Court of Appeals had 
stated in  [**46] a prior case that to toll the statute of limitations a plaintiff would have to prove either fraudulent concealment or 
that ""the defendant's conduct by reason of its fraudulent nature was inherently self-concealing."" King & King, 657 F.2d at 1154 
(quoting Ashland Oil Co. v. Union Oil Co., 567 F.2d 984, 988 (Temp. Emerg. Ct. App. 1977)). The Tenth Circuit did not pass on 
the propriety of that standard in King & King, however, nor has the Tenth Circuit subsequently adopted the self-concealing 
standard. Because the Court has not dismissed plaintiffs' tolling claim as it relates to the period from 1994 to 1998, and in the 
absence of Tenth Circuit authority or argument by plaintiffs on this point, the Court declines to adopt the lesser self-concealing 
standard at this stage. See Urethane II, 235 F.R.D. at 518 (declining to decide whether the Tenth Circuit would adopt the self-
concealing standard where plaintiffs' allegations satisfied the intermediate ""affirmative acts"" standard."
938,8," Plaintiffs' state-law claims are based on the same substantive allegations of a price-fixing conspiracy that support their federal 
claim, and the Court does not agree with defendants that the case presents novel or complex issues of state law or that 
exceptional circumstances exist here; accordingly, the Court will not decline to exercise  [**48] supplemental jurisdiction over the 
state-law claims in this case pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c). "
940,9," It is true that the tolling rule's rationale of preventing protective filings by potential opt-outs might be served in cases in which 
the same federal court hears both the class action and the individual actions. Nevertheless, the Court is bound to apply the 
tolling law as the Tennessee courts would. "
941,10," Plaintiffs (and the Linerboard court) were able to identify courts in only two states that have adopted cross-jurisdictional tolling. 
See Vaccariello v. Smith & Nephew Richards, Inc., 94 Ohio St. 3d 380, 2002 Ohio 892, 763 N.E.2d 160, 163 (Ohio 2002); Staub 
v. Eastman Kodak Co., 320 N.J. Super. 34, 726 A.2d 955, 962-67 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 1999)."
941,11," In their original brief, defendants stated that they did not move to dismiss plaintiffs' 1999-2004 claims under Wisconsin law as 
time-barred in light of Wisconsin's six-year statute of limitations for antitrust actions. See Wis. Stat. § 133.18(2). In their 
response, plaintiffs noted that concession and the lack of any mention of the 1994-98 claims under Wisconsin law. Defendants 
then argued in a footnote in their reply brief that without tolling from the class action filing, any pre-2002 Wisconsin claims would 
also be time-barred. The Court rejects defendants'  [**58] argument for two reasons. First, defendants have not accounted for 
plaintiffs' theory of tolling based on fraudulent concealment, which would save all Wisconsin claims at this stage. Second, 
defendants may not seek dismissal of particular claims for the first time in a reply brief. See, e.g., U.S. Fire Ins. Co. v. Bunge N. 
Am., Inc., 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 59737, 2008 WL 3077074, at *9 n.7 (D. Kan. Aug. 4, 2008) (HN24[
] court will not consider 
argument raised for first time in reply brief) (citing Minshall v. McGraw Hill Broadcasting Co., 323 F.3d 1273, 1288 (10th Cir. 
2003)). Accordingly, the Court does not consider whether Wisconsin recognizes cross-jurisdictional class-action tolling. "
943,12," In light of the Court's dismissal of all claims under Indiana and Tennessee law, the Court does not address defendants' 
alternative bases for dismissal of those claims. If claims under those states' statutes for the period from 1994 to 1998 are 
properly pleaded in amended complaints, such arguments may be asserted and will be resolved accordingly. "
979,1," At the time of the hearing before Judge Peck, the plaintiffs had moved to compel enforcement of their subpoena. The 
defendants had not yet moved to compel enforcement of their subpoena but advised Judge Peck of their intent to do so. "
983,*," After examining the briefs and the record, we have concluded that oral argument is unnecessary. Thus, the appeal is submitted 
on the briefs and the record. See FED. R. APP. P. 34(a)(2). "
991,1," Section 1 provides in pertinent part: ""Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of 
trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal."" 15 U.S.C. § 1. "
992,2," The Noerr-Pennington doctrine immunizes concerted efforts to influence public officials from the Sherman Act regardless of 
intent or purpose. See generally Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 140, 81 S. 
Ct. 523, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464 (1961); see also Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 670, 85 S. Ct. 1585, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626 
(1965). "
993,3," Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S. 341, 63 S. Ct. 307, 87 L. Ed. 315 (1943), recognized the States' freedom to engage in 
anticompetitive regulation. "
994,4," The ""sham"" exception to Noerr-Pennington encompasses situations in which persons use the governmental process -- as 
opposed to the outcome of that process -- as an anticompetitive weapon. Omni, 499 U.S. at 380. A classic example is the filing 
of frivolous objections to the license application of a competitor, with no expectation of achieving denial of the license but simply 
in order to impose expense and delay. Id. A ""sham"" situation involves a defendant whose activities are not genuinely aimed at 
procuring favorable government action, as opposed to a defendant who genuinely seeks to achieve a governmental result, but 
does so through improper means. Id. "
1003,1," HN1[
] Section 1 of the Sherman Act provides in relevant part that  [**11] ""[e]very contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be 
illegal."" 15 U.S.C. § 1. "
1006,2," As indicated in a case cited by plaintiffs, ""[a] plaintiff may surely rely on governmental investigations, but must also, under 
FRCP 11, undertake his own reasonable inquiry and frame his complaint with allegations of his own design."" In re Tableware 
Antitrust Litig., 363 F. Supp. 2d 1203, 1205 (N.D. Cal. 2005). ""Simply saying 'me too' after a governmental investigation does not 
state a claim."" Id. "
1007,3," See William O. Gilley Enters., Inc. v. Atl. Richfield Co., 561 F.3d 1004, 1010 (9th Cir. 2009) (reversing Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal 
and holding that actual contracts defendants separately executed could be considered in the aggregate in assessing antitrust 
liability, reasoning that ""a defendant who restrains trade by an obvious pattern and practice of entering into individual contracts 
should not be allowed to do piecemeal what he would be prohibited from doing all at once""); In re SRAM, 580 F. Supp. 2d at 
901-02 (denying motion to dismiss antitrust claims, observing that ""Plaintiffs include in their complaints a number of specific 
allegations of communications,"" ""Plaintiffs cite various emails in which individual Defendants consider information obtained from 
other Defendants,"" and ""Plaintiffs have further supported those allegations with evidence of communications between Defendant 
companies,"" including ""a 1998 email chain between Hitachi and Samsung""); In re Hypodermic Prods. Antitrust Litig., 2007 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 47438, 2007 WL 1959225 at *12 (D.N.J.) (denying 12(b)(6) motion, finding that ""the instant Complaint sets forth 
allegations of specific anti-competitive agreements""); see also In re Flash Memory, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 38941, 2009 WL 
1096602 at *6  [**28] (denying motion to dismiss direct purchasers' complaint, which alleged inter alia that ""Samsung's Vice 
President of Marketing sent an internal email to the various heads of the company's regional memory sales groups"" instructing 
the recipients ""to contact their competitors to urge them that they 'must not retreat from the last quoted price'"" and that Samsung 
had made announcements to industry analysts concerning ""severe shortages"" in overall inventories, which would ""bolster its 
margins,"" but about which it would have no knowledge absent communications with its competitors (emphasis in original))."
1007,4," See In re Flat Glass Antitrust Litig., 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10329, 2009 WL 331361 (W.D. Pa.) (denying Rule 12(b)(6) motion 
in the face of allegations that (i) historically, the defendant construction glass manufacturers had been unable to raise and 
maintain prices and they had varied their surcharges by region of the country, (ii) during the period of the supposed conspiracy, 
the manufacturers' prices increased by ""identical percentages"" and their surcharges did not differ by region, and (iii) the parallel 
conduct ceased after similar antitrust behavior was thwarted in Europe); In re Thin Film Transitor Liquid Crystal Display (TFT-
LCD / Flat Panel) Antitrust Litig., 586 F. Supp. 2d 1109, 1115-16 (N.D. Cal. 2008)  [**29] (denying motion to dismiss direct 
purchasers' complaint, concluding that ""[t]he complaint alleges complex and unusual pricing practices by defendants, which 
cannot be explained by the forces of supply and demand"" in that, prior to the conspiracy, ""the industry faced declining TFT-LCD 
panel prices"" due to ""advances in technology and improving efficiencies,"" as well as new companies entering the market, but 
beginning in 1996, the TFT-LCD product market was ""'characterized by unnatural and sustained price stability, as well as certain 
periods of substantial increases in prices' [and] a compression of price ranges . . . , which is inconsistent with natural market 
forces"")."
1007,5," The only allegation of a contractual relationship between Matson and Horizon involves vessel capacity sharing on the Los 
Angeles to Hawaii route. See Consolidated Complaint at P 98 (docket no. 69). This type of arrangement, however, appears 
consistent with the water freight industry. See, e.g., DHX, Inc. v. Surface Transp. Bd., 501 F.3d 1080, 1083 (9th Cir. 2007). In 
DHX, Inc., the Ninth Circuit explained that, although ""some shipments via water carrier are arranged between the carrier and the 
shipper directly, others  [**30] are handled through a third-party intermediary such as a freight forwarder."" Id. A freight forwarder 
""assembl[es] and consolidat[es] shipments to take advantage of volume rates offered by the carrier actually hauling the goods,"" "
1008,," and it maintains the dual status of both carrier and shipper. Id. Freight forwarders earn a profit by charging rates lower than a 
water carrier's price for small shipments, but higher than the amount paid to the water carrier for the consolidated load. Id. 
Absent some direct evidence of an anticompetitive agreement, the Consolidated Complaint establishes nothing more than the 
customer-as-well-as-competitor relationship common in the water trade."
1008,6," Defendants complain that plaintiffs, in comparing a 333% and 396% increase in diesel and RFO prices, respectively, to a 
1,929% increase in fuel surcharges over the same period, have performed ""fuzzy math."" See Reply at 7 n.7 (docket no. 97); see 
also Consolidated Complaint at P 88 (docket no. 69). Although the Court accepts as true, as it must for purposes of defendants' 
Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the percentage increases stated in the Consolidated Complaint, the Court is not required to and does not 
adopt plaintiffs' theory  [**31] that the disparities in the percentages of change reflect a lack of correlation between fuel prices 
and fuel surcharges. Fuel prices and fuel surcharges involve different units of measurement and orders of magnitude, making a 
straight, uncalibrated comparison of their percentage increases inappropriate."
1008,7," Unlike noncontiguous domestic carriers, however, LTL service providers are not subject to tariff filing requirements, the industry 
having been deregulated for more than a decade. 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14276, 2009 WL 323219 at *3 (citing the Motor Carrier 
Act enacted in 1980, the 1994 Trucking Industry Regulatory Reform Act, and the ICC Termination Act of 1995). "
1012,8," HN14[
] By statute, port-to-port rates or divisions for noncontiguous domestic trade water carriers are presumed reasonable 
""if the aggregate of increases  [**48] and decreases in any such rate or division is not more than 7.5 percent above, or more 
than 10 percent below, the rate or division in effect 1 year before the effective date of the proposed rate or division."" 49 U.S.C. § 
13701(d)(1); see also 49 U.S.C. § 13701(d)(2) (the percentages stated in § 13701(d)(1) must be annually adjusted in 
accordance with the Producers Price Index)."
1012,9," Defendants suggest that the Court may take judicial notice of their publicly filed tariffs without converting their Rule 12(b)(6) 
motion into a summary judgment motion. See Reply at 11 n.10 (docket no. 97); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(d) (""If, on a motion 
under Rule 12(b)(6) or 12(c), matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion must be 
treated as one for summary judgment under Rule 56.""). Defendants, however, have provided no documents or citations (for 
example, to an STB publication or website) based on which the Court could take such judicial notice, and the Court declines to 
do so. See Fed. R. Evid. 201(b) (""A judicially noticed fact must be one not subject to reasonable dispute in that it is either (1) 
generally  [**51] known within the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court or (2) capable of accurate and ready determination by 
resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.""). "
1014,10," Plaintiffs contend that Matson negotiated § 14101(b) agreements with General Motors Corp. (""GM"") and Ford Motor Co. 
(""Ford""), ostensibly in an effort to compete with Pasha Hawaii Transport Lines LLC (""Pasha""), which had, in 2005, secured a 
similar arrangement with Chrysler Group LLC. Consolidated Complaint at P 100 (docket no. 69). Plaintiffs also assert that 
Matson chartered a particular vessel, the S.S. Great Land, to prevent Pasha from obtaining it and being in a position to offer 
weekly service. Id. These allegations do not implicate any entity other than Matson and therefore, standing alone, they do not 
plausibly identify an unlawful restraint of trade ""effected by a contract, combination, or conspiracy."" See Twombly, 550 U.S. at 
553, 556-57. "
1015,11," At oral argument, plaintiffs asserted that the STB has not engaged in ""meaningful review"" of the fuel surcharges at issue and 
that, therefore, the filed rate doctrine does not apply, relying on Brown v. Ticor Title Ins. Co., 982 F.2d 386 (9th Cir. 1992), and 
Wileman Bros. & Elliott, Inc. v. Giannini, 909 F.2d 332 (9th Cir. 1990). These cases are distinguishable. Brown involved state, as 
opposed to federal, regulatory schemes, and both cases dealt with ""non-disapproval"" regimes pursuant to which the agency did 
not and was not required to engage in antecedent review of the rate or standard at issue. Brown, 982 F.2d at 393 (the ""Arizona 
and Wisconsin statutes do not provide for affirmative governmental approval""); Wileman Bros., 909 F.2d at 338 (observing that 
""nondisapproval requires neither publication and comment nor explicit findings"" and that ""non-disapproval is equally consistent 
with lack of knowledge or neglect as it is with assent""); see also McCray v. Fidelity Nat'l Title Ins. Co., 636 F. Supp. 2d 322, 2009 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 60329, 2009 WL 2170694, *5 (D. Del.)  [**62] (""Other than the Ninth Circuit in Brown, no other court has taken 
such a narrow view of the applicability of the filed rate doctrine.""). In this matter, plaintiffs do not assert that the STB, a federal 
agency, lacks the authority to review the fuel surcharges. Indeed, as recently as September 1998, the Government of the 
Territory of Guam (""GovGuam"") filed a complaint with the STB, challenging the reasonableness of ""rates, rules, classifications, 
and practices for all transportation by water"" to and from Guam provided by Sea-Land Service, Inc. (now Horizon) and Matson. 
Guam v. Sea-Land Serv., Inc., 2007 WL 295310 (STB). The STB never reached the merits, however, because GovGuam 
voluntarily dismissed the proceedings. Plaintiffs' complaints about the manner in which the STB has or has not exercised its 
jurisdiction with regard to noncontiguous domestic shipping tariffs do not remove this case from the realm of the filed rate 
doctrine. See In re Pa. Title Ins. Antitrust Litig., 648 F. Supp. 2d 663, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 62648, 2009 WL 2190669 at *9 
(E.D. Pa.) (holding that ""as long as the regulatory scheme requires the filing of rates with a government agency that has legal 
authority to review those rates, the filed rate doctrine applies  [**63] regardless of the actual degree of agency review of those 
filed rates""). "
1016,12," Plaintiffs have asked for permission to conduct discovery before amending their complaint. Plaintiffs' request is DENIED. See 
Twombly, 550 U.S. at 558-59. "
1017,1," The Debtors are: Midway Games Inc., Midway Home Entertainment Inc., Midway Amusement Games, LLC, Midway Interactive 
Inc., Surreal Software Inc., Midway Studios-Austin Inc., Midway Studios-Los Angeles Inc., Midway Games West Inc., Midway 
Home Studios Inc., and Midway Sales Company, LLC. "
1018,2," All capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this Order have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Sale Motion or the 
Purchase Agreement, as applicable. In the event of any inconsistency between the use of capitalized terms in the Sale Motion 
and Purchase Agreement, the Purchase Agreement shall control. "
1047,1," The Court accepts the well-pleaded facts of the counterclaims as true, as it must at the motion to dismiss stage. See, e.g., 
Smith v. United States, 561 F.3d 1090, 1098 (10th Cir. 2009). "
1050,2," Some Tenth Circuit cases list as an additional element that the conspiracy must have had an effect on interstate commerce. 
See, e.g., Lantec, Inc. v. Novell, Inc., 306 F.3d 1003, 1028 (10th Cir. 2002) (""According to Tenth Circuit case law, a conspiracy 
to monopolize claim requires proof of '(1) the existence of a combination or conspiracy to monopolize; (2) overt acts done in 
furtherance of the combination or conspiracy; (3) an effect upon an appreciable amount of interstate commerce; and (4) a 
specific intent to monopolize.'"" (quoting TV Commc'ns Network, 964 F.2d at 1026)). Because  [*13] this ""effect on commerce"" 
element is not at issue in the present motion, the Court need not reconcile these different descriptions of the claim. "
1057,3," Universal Analytics specifically involved a company's hiring of employees away from a rival rather than, as in this case, a 
company allegedly ""locking up"" its own employees to keep them from moving to another firm. 914 F.2d at 1257. The parties do 
not cite, nor has this Court found, any case discussing preemptive, predatory ""lock-up"" rather than predatory hiring of a rival's 
employees. However, the Court finds the two situations analogous. In both circumstances, the defendant seeks to prevent a rival 
from competing by denying that rival key employees. Thus, the Court finds the Universal Analytics analysis relevant to the facts 
of this case. "
1059,4," The Court is skeptical that TRC could have collaborated with ""parties to the non-compete agreements."" These parties are 
allegedly TRC employees. (Doc. # 79 P 136.) The general rule is that ""a corporation cannot conspire with its own employees"" for "
1060,," the purpose of antitrust liability. Motive Parts Warehouse v. Facet Enters., 774 F.2d 380, 387 (1985). There are, however, 
exceptions to the rule. See id. (""One exception to that general rule . . . is that employees are capable of combining with their 
corporate employer where they have an 'independent personal stake' and thus stand to benefit from conspiring with the 
corporation to restrain trade."" (quoting Holter v. Moore & Co., 702 F.2d 854, 855 (10th Cir. 1983))). As the parties do not raise 
this argument or discuss whether an exception to the rule applies, the Court does not address this issue here. "
1073,1, All documents regarding plaintiffs' loans and default were recorded with the Official Records of Tulare County. 
1077,2," ""TILA"" refers to the Truth in Lending Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1601, et seq. ""RESPA"" refers to the Real Estate Settlement Procedures 
Act, 12 U.S.C. §§ 2601, et seq. "
1078,3," HN22[
] F.R.Civ.P. 9(b)'s particularity requirement applies to state law causes of action: ""[W]hile a federal  [**19] court will examine state law to determine whether the elements of fraud have been pled sufficiently to state a cause of action, the Rule 
9(b) requirement that the circumstances of the fraud must be stated with particularity is a federally imposed rule."" Vess v. Ciba-
Geigy Corp. USA, 317 F.3d 1097, 1103 (9th Cir. 2003) (quoting Hayduk v. Lanna, 775 F.2d 441, 443 (1st Cir. 1995)(italics in 
original)). "
1083,4, This Court is uncertain why defendants refer to California Code of Civil Procedure section 1060. 
1094,1," HN3[
] Ordinarily, in ruling on a motion to dismiss, ""a court may not consider any documents that are outside of the complaint, 
or not expressly incorporated therein, unless the motion is converted into one for summary judgment."" Alternative Energy, Inc. v. 
St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co., 267 F.3d 30, 33-34 (1st Cir. 2001). In Alternative Energy, the First Circuit  [**12] described ""a 
narrow exception"" to this rule ""'for documents the authenticity of which are not disputed by the parties; for official public records; 
for documents central to plaintiffs' claim; or for documents sufficiently referred to in the complaint.'"" Id. (quoting Watterson v. 
Page, 987 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1993)). ""When the complaint relies upon a document, whose authenticity is not challenged, such a 
document merges into the pleadings and the court may properly consider it under a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. "" Id. 
(internal quotations omitted); see also Town of Norwood v. New Eng. Power Co., 202 F.3d 408, 414 (1st Cir. 2000) (noting that 
in addressing a motion to dismiss a tying claim, a district court ""considered the allegations in the complaint, documents attached 
to it, and matters of public record""). Here, Amazon attached two documents to its motion to dismiss: 1) an open letter to interested parties regarding Amazon's POD 
policy, and 2) the Advantage Membership Agreement. Def.'s Mot. at Attach. 1, Open Letter to Interested Parties (Docket # 38-2); 
Def.'s Mot. at Attach. 2, Advantage Membership Agreement (Docket # 38-3). In its opposition, BookLocker does not challenge 
the  [**13] authenticity of these documents. Further, BookLocker's Amended Complaint references the terms of the Advantage 
Agreement, Am. Compl. P 41, and Amazon's POD policy is central to BookLocker's claim. Accordingly, the Court considers 
Amazon's submissions in ruling on Amazon's motion. "
1095,2," BookLocker's Amended Complaint does not assert that Amazon violated the ""rule of reason,"" instead focusing on a per se 
theory. See Am. Compl. P 55; see also Jefferson Parish Hosp. Dist. No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 29-31, 104 S. Ct. 1551, 80 L. Ed. 
2d 2 (1984) (noting that in the absence of per se liability, an antitrust plaintiff must prove the defendant's conduct had an ""actual 
adverse effect on competition""); Data Gen. Corp. v. Grumman Sys. Support Corp., 36 F.3d 1147, 1178 n.54 (1st Cir. 1994). In 
any event, the gap between a per se claim and a rule of reason claim in the tying context may not be wide. See Lee v. Life Ins. 
Co. of N. Am., 23 F.3d 14, 16 (1st Cir. 1994) (""Since many product ties may not prove anti-competitive, notwithstanding their 
somewhat misleading epithet, per se tie-ins may require a fairly subtle antitrust analysis of market power, a fact-intensive inquiry 
aimed at winnowing out only those ties most likely to threaten anti-competitive harm."" (internal quotations omitted));

separate analysis unnecessary.""); AVX Corp. v. Cabot Corp., 600 F. Supp. 2d 286, 288 (D. Mass. 2009)."
1095,3," A preliminary matter merits brief discussion. BookLocker brought this suit as a putative class action. Under Rule 23(c)(1)(A), 
when a plaintiff sues as a representative of a class, the court must ""[a]t an early practicable time"" determine by order whether to 
certify the action as a class action. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(1)(A). To date, class certification has not been attained in this matter.

motion] in a putative class action before taking up the issue of class certification. '"" Good v. Altria Group, Inc., 231 F.R.D. 446,

at *11 n.6 (D.N.H. Sept. 23, 2005)); see also Sanchez v. Triple-S Mgmt., Corp., 492 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2007)  [**18] (affirming 
district court grant of summary judgment prior to class certification). Here, no prejudice to either BookLocker or the putative class 
members is apparent, and BookLocker has not objected to having the motion to dismiss decided before class certification. As a 
consequence of the pre-certification nature of the matter, for the purposes of assessing the pending motion to dismiss, ""the 
potential claims of putative class members other than the named plaintiff are simply not before the court."" Evans, No. 04-CV-
103-JD, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20997, at *11. Therefore, in reviewing the motion, BookLocker's claim is treated as being brought "
1096,," solely by BookLocker. Id.; see also Rutan v. Republican Party of Ill., 868 F.2d 943, 947 (7th Cir. 1989) (""Because no class of 
plaintiffs or defendants were certified, only the named plaintiffs and named defendants are before this court.""), rev'd in part on 
other grounds, 497 U.S. 62, 110 S. Ct. 2729, 111 L. Ed. 2d 52 (1990). At oral argument, the parties agreed that the Court should 
proceed with the motion to dismiss despite the fact the class has not yet been certified."

1096,80," (analyzing an alleged tie involving computer support services); Sheridan v. Marathon Petroleum Co., 530 F.3d 590, 592 (7th 
Cir. 2008)  [**20] (""In a tying agreement, a seller conditions the sale of a product or service on the buyer's buying another 
product or service from or (as in this case) by direction of the seller."")."
1096,5, Amazon conceded this point at oral argument. 
1097,6," Amazon notes that BookLocker's contention is inconsistent with other statements in the Amended Complaint which indicate 
that  [**23] Amazon's take from the sale of a book is based on the book's list price, not its sales price. Def.'s Reply at 7-8. The 
important point, however, remains unaltered: ""Amazon effectively receives a commission from each sale."" Pl.'s Opp'n at 10."
1097,7, BookLocker cites no such case and the Court has found none. 
1098,8," The Court rejects Amazon's characterization of BookLocker's allegations as describing a straightforward vertical supply 
arrangement. See Def. 's Mot. at 12-14. Similarly, it finds Eastern Food Services, Inc. v. Pontifical Catholic University Services 
Association, 357 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2004), an exclusive dealing case involving a lawsuit brought by a beverage provider against a 
university for contracting with another beverage provider to provide beverages on the university's campus, inapposite to the 
conduct alleged here: tying of a service offered by one corporation to another service offered by a subsidiary."
1098,9," Amazon has informed  [**29] POD publishers that they may keep the Direct Amazon Sales Channel active if they agree to 
enroll in a program known as Amazon Advantage. Am. Compl. P 41. Nevertheless, BookLocker discounts this secondary 
avenue to the Direct Amazon Sales Channel as a non-option, arguing that ""the terms and conditions of participating in that 
program are so onerous so as to preclude it from being an economically viable option for POD book publishers."" Id. BookLocker 
elaborates: First, the 'Amazon Advantage' contract requires publishers to deposit five copies of each title with Amazon at the publisher's 
own expense--Amazon does not pay for any book until an order is received and paid for by a customer. It would be 
prohibitively expensive for a POD publisher to front this enormous cost. For example, since Plaintiff currently publishes 
1,200 titles, it would have to pay for 6,000 books to be printed and supplied to Amazon. Plaintiff's expenses merely to join "
1099,," this program would easily exceed $ 35,000 before any revenue was received, with a continuing obligation to incur costs of 
placing POD books in Amazon's inventory. Second, under the 'Amazon Advantage' program, Amazon only remits 45% of a 
POD book's list  [**30] price to the publisher once it has been purchased by an ultimate consumer. These financial terms 
would force Plaintiff to sell its books at a loss or to price its books beyond what the market will bear. Id. As previously discussed, Amazon has submitted, and the Court is free to consider in ruling on the pending motion, the 
Advantage Membership Agreement. Nevertheless, on the limited record before it, it is impossible for the Court to adequately 
evaluate the reasonableness of all of the terms included therein. At this point, the Court is required to ""draw[] all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff's favor."" Fitzgerald, 549 F.3d at 52. From 
BookLocker's allegations, it is reasonable to infer that Plaintiff and other entities have found the Advantage program to be an 
untenable alternative to the Direct Amazon Sales Channel. Accordingly, the Court accepts for the purposes of this motion 
BookLocker's assertion that Advantage is not a viable option. See Marts, 77 F.3d at 1113 (HN13[
] ""Even if the products are 
available separately, an illegal tying arrangement can exist if purchasing the items together is the only viable economic option."" 
(internal quotation omitted)); Ways & Means, Inc. v. IVAC Corp., 506 F. Supp. 697, 701 (N.D. Cal. 1979)  [**31] (""[S]eparate 
availability will not preclude antitrust liability where a defendant has established its pricing policy in such a way that the only 
viable economic option is to purchase the tying and tied products in a single package.""), aff'd 638 F.2d 143 (9th Cir. 1981), cert. 
denied 454 U.S. 895, 102 S. Ct. 394, 70 L. Ed. 2d 210 (1981). In a similar vein, the Court accepts for the time being BookLocker's allegation that selling books via the Amazon Marketplace is 
an unviable substitute to listing on the Direct Amazon Sales Channel. Supporting such a finding are BookLocker's allegations (i) 
that BookSurge itself advertises the Direct Amazon Sales Channel as ""a distinction proven to life sales""; (ii) that Marketplace 
consumers must provide shipping information to third-party vendors and cannot take advantage of free shipping programs; (iii) 
that ""only a small fraction of POD book Bookstore sales are effectuated through the Amazon Marketplace""; (iv) that Marketplace 
book prices are often inflated to the detriment of sales due to Amazon's requirement that publishers impose a preset shipment 
charge per book; (v) that some authors have advised BookLocker that they will retain other publishers if BookLocker lacks 
access to  [**32] the Direct Amazon Sales Channel; and (vi) that Marketplace participation would require additional staff to 
handle the program's data entry requirements. See Am. Compl. PP 25-26, 42-44. Discovery may yet show that the Advantage program and the Marketplace are reasonable alternatives to transitioning to 
BookSurge, and that Amazon's multi-tiered approach is efficiency-enhancing. See Sheridan, 530 F.3d at 595-96 (holding that a 
program whereby franchisees are required to honor the franchisor's credit cards and to process sales with them did not 
constitute a tie, but instead a system allowing the franchisor's customers to have the same purchasing experience no matter 
which franchisee they purchase from). To this end, the Seventh Circuit's analysis in Sheridan may well prove applicable. In that 
case, Judge Posner noted that a powerful financial incentive to use one service where alternatives exist does not necessarily 
constitute a penalty imposed by the service provider, but may instead be an efficiency enhancing arrangement akin to inclusion 
of tires on a new car. Sheridan, 530 F.3d at 595-96. "
1100,10," If discovery reveals that Amazon has not acted on its announced plan to limit access to its Direct Amazon Sales Channel to 
POD publishers who use BookSurge, BookLocker will have to contend with Borschow Hospital and its apparent insistence that 
threats be carried out. See Borschow Hosp., 96 F.3d at 18. "
1102,11," For  [**42] its part, Amazon argues that anti-competitive effect cannot be shown because Lightning Source, not BookSurge, is 
the dominant POD printer, and BookLocker has not alleged any threat to Lightning Source's dominance. Def.'s Mot. at 20-21. 
While such an allegation would certainly buttress BookLocker's claim, Amazon offers and the Court is unaware of any authority 
for such a requirement. "
1106,1," The CFTC brought its action in the Northern District of Texas. CFTC v. Energy Transfer Partners, L.P. et al, 3:07-cv-1301-K. 
The CFTC action was dismissed in 2008 pursuant to a Consent Order that contained no conclusions of law or findings of fact. In 
the Order, Defendants neither admitted nor denied the allegations in the Complaint. The FERC brought an administrative action 
alleging that Defendants violated the Natural Gas Act and the Natural Gas Policy Act. As of July 2009, the FERC action appears 
to be in abeyance. (FERC Doc. No. IN06-3-003)."
1106,2," Most of these trades took place on the Intercontinental Exchange (""ICE""),  [*4] not the NYMEX. (Pl. 2d Am. Compl. P 32.)"
1106,3," NYMEX uses the Henry Hub as the point of delivery for its natural gas futures contracts. (Pl. 2d Am. Compl. P 22.) Henry Hub 
is located at Sabine's Henry Gas Processing Plant in Louisiana. (Pl. 2d Am. Compl. P 23.)"
1106,4," Natural gas delivered at the HSC is traded on the Intercontinental Exchange (""ICE""), an electronic trading platform that offers 
trading in physical natural gas contracts for more than 100 locations. (Pl. 2d. Am. Compl. P 53.)"
1106,5," The settlement price of a NYMEX natural gas futures contract is the volume-weighted average price of trades made during the 
last 30 minutes of trading on the termination day for the next calendar month's contract (""the prompt-month contract"") (from 2:00 "
1107,," p.m. to 2:30 p.m. EST). (Pl. 2d Am. Compl. P 24.) The termination day for a NYMEX natural gas contract is the third-to-last 
business day of the month preceding the prompt month. (Id.)"
1107,6," The settlement price of a financial swap is based on the difference between the HSC price index for a given month and the final 
settlement price of the NYMEX natural gas futures contract for that month. (Pl. 2d Am. Compl. P 61.)"
1107,7," A buyer who is obligated to pay for the commodity and take delivery at the end of the settlement period is on the ""long"" side of 
a NYMEX contract. Conversely, the seller who is obligated to receive payment for the commodity and make delivery is on the 
""short"" side. "
1109,8," The Crude Oil Litigation court dismissed the complaint because it found that plaintiffs  [*15] had only alleged that the 
defendants had a large presence in the Cushing, Oklahoma crude oil market as well as the NYMEX futures and options market 
and they stood to gain large profits by manipulating crude oil prices. These allegations were insufficient to allow the Court to find 
a strong inference of scienter."
1109,9," Likewise, in the Fifth Circuit, securities fraud scienter can be established with intent or severe recklessness and may be based 
on circumstantial evidence. Fin. Acquisition Ptnrs. v. Blackwell, 440 F.3d 278, 286 (5th Cir. 2006); Goldstein v. MCI WorldCom, 
340 F.3d 238, 246 (5th Cir. 2003)."
1109,10," The defendants involved in CFTC v. Johnson settled with the CFTC except Anthony Dizona. Eventually Judge Kenneth Hoyt 
set aside a jury verdict in favor of the CFTC because it found insufficient evidence of ""specific intent"" to support the jury's verdict. 
In setting aside the verdict, Judge Hoyt explained ""The term 'specific intent' describes a particular mens rea. Generally, the term 
'willfully' defines an act as committed voluntarily and purposely, with the 'specific intent' to do something the law forbids--with bad 
purpose either to disobey or disregard the law."" Judge Hoyt explained that the jury did not find that  [*19] Dizona knowingly 
delivered false or inaccurate reports concerning market information to the reporting services. U S CFTC v. Dizona, C.A. No. 05-
332, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 109913, *11 (S.D.Tex. April 24, 2008). "
1110,11," In a criminal case involving the manipulation provision, a district court has explained ""[T]he criminal manipulation provision 
prohibits defendants from engaging in intentional conduct aimed at preventing the basic forces of supply and demand from 
operating properly. Thus, the criminal manipulation provision is concerned less with the price itself than it is with the process by 
which the price is set."" United States v. Reliant Energy Services, Inc., 420 F.Supp.2d 1043, 1057-58 (N.D. Cal. 2006). "
1112,12," Other cases cited by the parties failed to reach the issue, declined to apply Rule 9(b) because there was no precedent doing 
so, or relied on cases that failed to reach the issue. CFTC v. Atha, 420 F.Supp.2d 1373, 1381-82 (N.D. Ga. 2006) (citing 
conflicting authority and concluding that even if Rule 9(b) applied to § 13(a)(2), the plaintiffs have met their burden); United 
States CFTC v. Enron Corp., C.A. No. H-03-909, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 28794, 2004 WL 594752, *3 (S.D. Tex. Mar 10, 2004) 
(manipulation need not be pled with particularity, citing, without discussion, Three Crown Ltd. Partnership, 817 F.Supp. 1033 
(S.D.N.Y. 1993), in which the court declined to reach the issue); CFTC v. Johnson, 408 F.Supp.2d 259, 270 (S.D. Tex. 2005) 
(holding that Rule 9(b) does not apply because defendants failed to cite any authority for the proposition that it does); Premium 
Plus Partners, L.P. v. Davis, No. 04 C 1851, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6158, 2005 WL 711591, *14 (N.D. Ill. 2005) (holding that 
Rule 9(b) does not apply to a manipulation claim because the defendants failed to cite any law in favor  [*28] of the proposition 
and because the specific manipulation claim was not premised on allegations of fraud). "
1113,13," Plaintiffs also cite two cases for the proposition that other courts have described Dura as a narrow holding--these cases do not 
significantly advance either party's argument. Oscar Private Equity Investments v. Allegiance Telecom, Inc., 487 F.3d 261, 265 
n.16 (5th Cir. 2007) (""Essentially, we require plaintiffs to establish loss causation in order to trigger the fraud-on-the-market 
presumption… Our approach [for addressing a securities act 10b-5 claim] is unaffected by the Supreme Court's recent and very 
narrow decision in [Dura]""); Enron Corp. Sec. v. Enron Corp., 439 F.Supp.2d 692, 700 (S.D. Tex. 2006)  [*31] (""Thus the high 
court addressed a narrow issue: it held that in a fraud-on-the-market case a plaintiff must plead, and ultimately prove, more than 
simply that the defendant's misrepresentation caused the stock price to be inflated"")."
1113,14," Other courts have declined to extend Dura's holding to fraud related to assets with intrinsic value, by explaining that artificially 
inflated prices on fungible assets like securities have a different effect on the holder than do inflated prices for the purchase of a 
business. See Merrill Lynch & Co. Inc. v. Allegheny Energy, Inc., 500 F.3d 171, 181-83 (2d Cir. 2007). "
1115,15," Defendants note that Plaintiffs did not allege the price differential for the futures contract they held and do not specify which 
futures contract is at issue. Plaintiffs state that the HSC Index affected futures prices throughout the month and, accordingly, 
they argue that even if Plaintiffs purchased their futures contract near the end of the month, market was still artificial. (Pl. 2d Am. 
Compl. P 4.) Plaintiffs' argument does not raise their allegations  [*38] above the level required for a plausible private CEA claim. "
1123,1," The HMTAP-1 contract was executed by URS's predecessor, Woodward-Clyde Federal Services; however, for purposes of 
convenience, the Court refers only to URS in this Order. "
1124,2," At the time of the HMTAP-1 contract, § 52.227-1 provided: The Government authorizes and consents to all use and manufacture, in performing this contract or any subcontract at any 
tier, of any invention described in and covered by a United States patent (1) embodied in the structure or composition of 
any article the delivery of which is accepted by the Government under this [*15]  contract or (2) used in machinery, tools, or 
methods whose use necessarily results from compliance by the Contractor or a subcontractor with (i) specifications or 
written provisions forming a part of this contract or (ii) specific written instructions given by the Contracting Officer directing 
the manner of performance. The entire liability to the Government for infringement of a patent of the United States shall be 
determined solely by the provisions of the indemnity clause, if any, included in this contract or any subcontract hereunder 
(including any lower-tier subcontract), and the Government assumes liability for all other infringement to the extent of the 
authorization and consent hereinabove granted."
1124,48, C.F.R. § 52.227-1(a) (1984). 
1125,3, Marshall & Swift and E.H. Boeckh had not yet merged at the time of the cost estimate. 
1128,4," As noted above, a current multiplier is a value used to adjust the base cost to account for changes in construction costs over 
time. (Shelton Decl., Ex. X [2001 Guidance Manual] at 649.) A local multiplier is a value used to adjust costs to recognize 
regional differences in construction costs. (Id.) Both figures can be found in industry-accepted residential cost-estimating guides, 
including the RCH. (See URS's Resp. Pl's SSAF ¶ 2.) "
1131,5," The parties disagree as to the applicability of cases construing 28 U.S.C. § 1498(a), which provides that the exclusive remedy 
for patent infringement by government contractors and subcontractors ""for the Government and with the authorization or 
consent of the Government"" is a suit against the United States in the Court of Federal Claims. Section 1498(a) is materially 
identical to § 1498(b) in that, under both subsections, an act of infringement by a contractor that is performed pursuant to the 
authorization or consent of the federal government is actionable only against the United States in the Court of Federal Claims. 
Moreover, the purpose of § 1498(b) is the same as that underlying § 1498(a), namely, ""to permit the government to purchase 
goods or services for the performance of governmental functions without the threat that the work [will] not be carried out because 
its supplier or contractor"" fears being sued for infringement. Windsurfing Int'l, Inc. v. Ostermann, 534 F. Supp. 581, 586-88 
(S.D.N.Y. 1982) (citing Richmond Screw Anchor Co. v. United States, 275 U.S. 331, 343, 48 S. Ct. 194, 72 L. Ed. 303, 65 Ct. Cl. "
1132,761," , 1928 Dec. Comm'r Pat. 246 (1928)), cited with approval in United States v. McCool, 751 F.2d 1112, 1113 (9th Cir. 1985) 
(per curiam) (construing § 1498(b)). As a result, cases analyzing § 1498(b) consistently refer to and apply cases interpreting the 
identical ""authorization or consent"" language found in § 1498(a). See, e.g., Auerbach, 829 F.2d at 179-80 (citing and discussing 
Bereslavsky v. Esso Standard Oil Co., 175 F.2d 148, 149 (4th Cir. 1949); Hughes Aircraft Co. v. United States, 534 F.2d 889, 
901, 209 Ct. Cl. 446 (Ct. Cl. 1976); Carrier Corp. v. United States, 534 F.2d 244, 247, 208 Ct. Cl. 678 (Ct. Cl. 1976)). 
Accordingly, the Court may properly consider cases construing § 1498(a) insofar as they are relevant to the question whether 
Defendants have shown the absence of genuine issues of material fact regarding authorization or consent under § 1498(b). "
1133,6," That the FAR does not contain an authorization or consent provision for copyright infringement is irrelevant; the parties plainly 
could have included express language in the agreements if they so desired. "
1134,7," Because the Court is denying the motions for summary judgment, the Court need not now definitively decide whether § 1498(b) 
is a jurisdictional bar or an affirmative defense. "
1136,8," ""Reverse passing off"" occurs when a party misrepresents someone else's goods or services as her own. Dastar Corp. v. 
Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp., 539 U.S. 23, 26 n.1, 123 S. Ct. 2041, 156 L. Ed. 2d 18 (2003). "
1137,9," The Court agrees with Marshall & Swift that the Court lacks a sufficient factual basis upon which to adjudicate Dewberry's fair 
use defense to the trademark infringement claim without the benefit of a complete record. Dewberry may renew its fair use 
defense after the parties have completed discovery, should Marshall & Swift amend its complaint to re-plead the trademark 
infringement claim. "
1142,10," ""There is no cause of action for unjust enrichment. Rather, unjust enrichment is a basis for obtaining restitution based on 
quasi-contract or imposition of a constructive trust."" McKell v. Wash. Mut., Inc., 142 Cal. App. 4th 1457, 49 Cal. Rptr. 3d 227, 
254 (Ct. App. 2006) (citing 1 B.E. Witkin, Summary of California Law §§ 1015-1016 (10th ed. 2005)); see also Melchior v. New 
Line Prods., Inc., 106 Cal. App. 4th 779, 131 Cal. Rptr. 2d 347, 357 (Ct. App. 2003). "
1154,1," The Purepac Defendants (""Purepac"") are Purepac Pharmaceutical Co., a Delaware corporation; Faulding Inc., a Delaware 
corporation; and Actavis Elizabeth LLC, a Delaware limited liability company. Purepac was a wholly-owned subsidiary of 
Faulding, and was the initial holder of the ANDAs at issue in this proceeding. Actavis is the successor to Purepac 
Pharmaceutical Co. and is the current holder of the relevant ANDAs."
1154,2," The Court recommends that this Opinion be read in conjunction with the Teva Opinion as well as the Opinion handed down 
today deciding Warner-Lambert's Motion to Dismiss the Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs' Claims in a related matter, In re Neurontin 
Antitrust Litig. (No. 02-1390, MDL No. 1479) (the ""Neurontin Antitrust Opinion""). The Court presumes familiarity with the facts 
and arguments set forth in such Opinions, as well as with the abbreviations and acronyms used therein. "
1155,3," Warner-Lambert filed two separate lawsuits against Purepac, one based on the ANDA for generic gabapentin capsules and the 
other based on the ANDA for generic gabapentin tablets. The ""Capsule Lawsuit"" was initiated in June 1998 (No. 98-2749) and 
the ""Tablet Lawsuit"" was initiated in December 1999 (No. 99-5948). In each lawsuit, Warner-Lambert asserted actual 
infringement of the '476 Patent and induced infringement of the '479 Patent. The lawsuits were consolidated for trial purposes in 
April 2001 in front of Hon. John C. Lifland, U.S.D.J."
1155,4," Purepac alleges in its counterclaims that Warner-Lambert fraudulently included  [**5] the '476 and '479 Patents in its NDA for 
approval of gabapentin anhydrous, which led to the listing of those patents in the Orange Book. According to Purepac, Warner-
Lambert listed the '476 Patent even though the gabapentin monohydrate covered by that patent was not used at any point 
during the production of Neurontin, and listed the '479 Patent even though the labeling authorization for Neurontin permits 
treatment only for illnesses related to epilepsy. Purepac alleged that Warner-Lambert's fraudulent listing of the '476 and '479 
Patents prevented Purepac from competing in the gabapentin market. Purepac further alleged that Warner-Lambert used the 
Orange Book listings of these patents as a basis to initiate patent infringement litigation solely to forestall Purepac's entrance 
into that market."
1155,5," Judge Lifland held that Purepac had standing to bring antitrust counterclaims, because Purepac had sufficiently alleged a 
causal connection between Warner-Lambert's actions and its injuries. Judge Lifland also held that the fact that Warner-
Lambert's infringement actions had survived motions for summary judgment did not, on its own, preclude Purepac's antitrust 
claims, which were based on allegations  [**6] that those infringement actions constituted ""sham litigation"" instituted for the sole 
purpose of precluding competition. Finally, with respect to the allegations of fraudulent Orange Book listings, Judge Lifland held 
that Purepac had adequately alleged ""that Warner-Lambert knowingly made misrepresentations to the FDA with the specific 
intent to prevent competition,"" such that discovery might develop proof that Warner-Lambert engaged in actionable 
anticompetitive conduct. 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22559, [WL] at *6."
1155,6," Purepac moved for summary judgment of noninfringement, arguing that its gabapentin product did not infringe the '476 Patent 
because it did not contain the monohydrate form of gabapentin claimed in that patent, and did not infringe the '479 Patent 
because the generic product would not be labeled for treating the  [**7] neurodegenerative diseases covered by that patent. 
Warner-Lambert responded that Purepac's gabapentin compounds may ""pass through"" the patented monohydrate form during 
the production process, thereby infringing the '476 Patent. Furthermore, Purepac's products would be prescribed and dispensed 
for off-label uses, thereby infringing the '479 Patent. Judge Lifland granted summary judgment of noninfringement of the '476 Patent in light of evidence that Purepac's gabapentin 
anhydrous was produced outside of the United States. Because United States patent laws are territorially limited, a U.S. patent 
cannot be infringed by acts entirely committed in a foreign country. See Pellegrini v. Analog Devices, Inc., 375 F.3d 1113, 1117 
(Fed. Cir. 2004) (""[As] the U.S. Supreme Court explained nearly 150 years ago in Brown v. Duchesne, 60 U.S. (19 How.) 183, 
15 L. Ed. 595 (1857), … the U.S. patent laws 'do not, and were not intended to, operate beyond the limits of the United 
States.'""); Rotec Indus., Inc. v. Mitsubishi Corp., 215 F.3d 1246, 1251 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (""'[T]he right conferred by a patent under 
our law is confined to the United States and its territories, and infringement of this right cannot  [**8] be predicated [on] acts 
wholly done in a foreign country.'"" (quoting Dowagiac Mfg. Co. v. Minnesota Moline Plow Co., 235 U.S. 641, 650, 35 S. Ct. 221, 
59 L. Ed. 398, 1915 Dec. Comm'r Pat. 320 (1915)). Warner-Lambert conceded this point, and did not oppose the motion for 
summary judgment with respect to the '476 Patent. "
1156,," Judge Lifland granted summary judgment of noninfringement of the '479 Patent on the basis of the summary judgment decision 
issued in Warner-Lambert Co. v. Apotex Corp., 316 F.3d 1348 (Fed. Cir. 2003). In that decision, based on facts that precisely 
mirrored those before Judge Lifland, the Federal Circuit held that Warner-Lambert had no cause of action for infringement of the 
'479 Patent because Congress intended to limit infringement actions for method-of-use patents to ""'controlling use patents,' or 
patents that claim an approved use of a drug."" Id. at 1362. Because Apotex had not submitted an application to sell a drug to 
treat neurodegenerative diseases, the only approved use covered by the '479 Patent, Warner-Lambert could not claim 
infringement of that patent, and Apotex was entitled to summary judgment of noninfringement. Judge Lifland held that the 
Apotex decision was binding precedent and that Purepac was entitled to  [**9] summary judgment on the same grounds."
1156,7," The Capsule and Tablet Lawsuits also triggered a collateral proceeding between Purepac and the FDA concerning the section 
viii statement Purepac initially filed with respect to the '479 Patent. Purepac submitted a section viii statement, rather than a 
Paragraph IV Certification, because the '479 Patent covered a use other than the labeled use for which Purepac sought generic 
approval. Section viii statements do not require notice to the patent-holder and do not allow the patent-holder to automatically 
initiate infringement litigation. The FDA, however, demanded that Purepac change its certification to one under either Paragraph 
III or Paragraph IV, arguing that a section viii statement was only appropriate when a label has more than one indication and the 
generic applicant seeks approval for only one of the many approved uses. Believing the demands made by the FDA, which 
would result in formal notice to Warner-Lambert, and likely result in another infringement action, 30-month stay and the loss of 
generic exclusivity, to be untenable, Purepac successfully sued the FDA to compel acceptance of the section viii statement. 
Purepac Pharm. Co. v. Thompson, 238 F. Supp. 2d 191 (D.D.C. 2002),  [**10] aff'd Purepac Pharm. Co. v. Thompson, 354 F.3d 
877, 359 U.S. App. D.C. 319 (D.C. Cir. 2004). Purepac argues that this collateral litigation should also be considered to be an 
anticompetitive injury stemming from Warner-Lambert's allegedly improper listing of the '479 Patent."
1156,8," Purepac asserts that its counterclaims arise under both Section 2 of the Sherman Act and Sections 4 and 16 of the Clayton 
Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 15(a), 26. These antitrust counterclaims, discussed in greater detail below, are substantially similar to the 
claims raised in In re Neurontin Antitrust Litig. and examined in the Neurontin Antitrust Opinion. Where appropriate, the Court will 
refer herein to arguments made or conclusions reached in connection with that Opinion. "

] Because a Rule 12(f) motion also challenges the legal sufficiency of the pleading, it is governed by the same standards as a motion to dismiss filed pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). Eisai Co., 557 F. Supp. 2d at 493 (citing Mars Inc. v. 
JCM American Corp., No. 05-3165, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 67530, 2006 WL 1704469, at *4 (D.N.J. June 14, 2006)). Accordingly, 
to determine whether Defendants' affirmative defenses are sufficient, the Court applies the same legal framework, accepting all 
factual allegations in Purepac's Answer as true, construing the Answer in the light most favorable to Purepac, and determining 
whether, under any reasonable reading of the pleadings, Purepac may be entitled to relief. Phillips, 515 F.3d at 233."
1157,10," HN6[
] In evaluating a motion to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), the Court may consider only the allegations pled in the counterclaim, exhibits attached to the counterclaim, matters of public record, and undisputedly authentic documents if "
1158,," the counterclaims are based on those  [**16] documents. Pension Ben. Guar. Corp. v. White Consol. Indus., 998 F.2d 1192, 
1196 (3d Cir. 1992). "
1159,11," The Court notes, however, that even though Purepac's unclean hands defense is not viable as a matter of law, evidence of 
Warner-Lambert's admitted marketing misconduct may be considered as a factor  [**21] affecting Warner-Lambert's ability to 
obtain a permanent injunction as relief in this proceeding. As noted in the Teva Opinion, any arguments that Warner-Lambert 
should not be allowed to rely on illegally acquired market share as a basis for injunctive relief or that it would be inequitable and 
against public interest to use a permanent injunction to protect Warner-Lambert's ill-gotten gains are, though not determinative at 
this stage of the litigation, both relevant and compelling. Such arguments, and the evidence required to support them, may be 
considered by the Court at a later stage. "
1160,12," Warner-Lambert has also moved to dismiss Purepac's unfair competition counterclaims, arguing that the allegations in 
Purepac's Answer fail to satisfy the standards set by the U.S. Supreme Court in Twombly. Warner-Lambert further argues that 
even assuming Purepac has survived the pleading requirements, the Noerr-Pennington doctrine immunizes petitioning activity 
not only from federal antitrust laws but also from related state law claims of unfair competition. See VIM, Inc. v. Somerset Hotel 
Ass'n, 19 F. Supp. 2d 422, 430 (W.D. Pa. 1998), aff'd without op., 187 F.3d 627 (3d Cir. 1999); Suburban Restoration Co. v. 
ACMAT Corp., 700 F.2d 98, 101 (2d Cir. 1983). Purepac  [**25] argues in response that the factual allegations presented in support of its federal claims also support its common 
law claims. Purepac claims that, accordingly, its unfair competition counterclaims survive this motion for the same reasons that 
its federal antitrust counterclaims do. Purepac is correct. HN11[
] In reviewing motions to dismiss both federal and New Jersey antitrust or unfair competition claims, 
when an antitrust plaintiff sufficiently alleges federal antitrust violations in the pleadings, ""it is fair to say that the conduct states a 
claim under the much broader common law tort of unfair competition."" Biovail Corp. Int'l v. Hoechst AG, 49 F. Supp. 2d 750, 777

Unfair Competition § 1 cmt. g (1995) (engaging in ""an unlawful restraint of trade"" constitutes unfair competition). Purepac's state 
law counterclaims will, therefore, be dismissed or survive to the same extent, and for the same reasons, as its federal antitrust 
counterclaims."

1161,14," As one court observed, ""[t]he presence of a patent informs our entire analysis here, because HN17[
] patent laws and 
antitrust  [**28] laws exist in tension, as the patent laws protect monopoly power while antitrust laws seek to restrain it. … Thus, 
any allegation of antitrust resulting from a patent must extend beyond the rights granted in the patent, and conduct permissible

patents. See, e.g., DiscoVision Assocs. v. Disc Mfg., Inc., Nos. 95-21 & 95-345, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7507, 1997 WL 309499,

2d 1008 (1999). In addition, a claim may be stated for violation of Section 2 if the patentee brings an infringement suit as

of a competitor."" Eastern R.R. Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 144, 81 S. Ct. 523, 5 L. Ed. 2d

anticompetitive conduct, and the elasticity of consumer demand."" Id.; see also Crossroads Cogeneration Corp. v. Orange &

1162,16," According to Purepac, ""Gabapentin monohydrate is not a component in Warner-Lambert's Neurontin products. Warner-
Lambert tested formulations containing gabapentin monohydrate as the active ingredient and found them unsuitable because 
 [**34] the additional water caused problems. Thus, gabapentin monohydrate and gabapentin anhydrous result in formulations 
with dissimilar characteristics. The FDA never authorized Warner-Lambert to use gabapentin monohydrate as a component in 
any Neurontin products. Neurontin products employ gabapentin anhydrous as the active ingredient."" Purepac Answer P 130. 
Purepac cites to statements made by Warner-Lambert to the Patent Office during the prosecution of the '476 Patent which 
indicated that the claimed gabapentin monohydrate differed from the prior art of the '175 or '544 Patents. With respect to the '479 Patent, Purepac emphasizes that Warner-Lambert certified that the '479 Patent covered ""the use of 
Neurontin,"" even though the only approved use of Neurontin was as a secondary treatment for epilepsy. Id. P 136. Purepac 
further alleges that ""[w]hen Warner-Lambert submitted the '479 patent for listing in the Orange Book, Warner-Lambert knew that 
it could not truthfully declare that the '479 patent covers the formulation, composition and/or method of use of Neurontin(R)."" Id.

1164,17," HN23[
] Antitrust standing requirements insure that litigants will use the antitrust laws to prevent anticompetitive actions and 
to deal only with economic problems whose solutions those laws were intended to effect. To this end, an antitrust plaintiff must 
allege more than constitutional standing (i.e., allegations of a case or controversy) to establish standing to pursue antitrust 
violations. See 54 Am. Jur. 2d Monopolies and Restraints of Trade § 400. In reaching a determination on standing, courts must 
consider the following: (1) whether there is a causal connection between an antitrust violation and harm to the plaintiff and the defendants intended 
to cause that harm; (2) whether  [**39] the nature of the plaintiff's alleged injury was of the type the antitrust laws were 
intended to forestall; (3) the directness or indirectness of the asserted injury; (4) whether the claim rests on some abstract 
or speculative measure of harm; and (5) the strong interest in keeping the scope of complex antitrust trials within judicially 
manageable limits, avoiding both duplicative recoveries and the complex apportionment of damages. December 22 Opinion, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22559, 2000 WL 34213890, at *7-8; see also Indium Corp. of America v. Semi-
Alloys, Inc., 781 F.2d 879, 882 (Fed. Cir.1985) (quoting Associated Gen. Contractors v. Cal. State Council of Carpenters, 459

focusing on certain key factors.""). "
1165,18," Warner-Lambert appears to overlook HN29[
] the ""law of the case"" doctrine, which ""limits relitigation of an issue once it has 
been decided"" in an earlier stage of the same litigation. Hamilton v. Leavy, 322 F.3d 776, 786-87 (3d Cir. 2003); In re Cont'l 
Airlines, Inc., 279 F.3d 226, 233 (3d Cir. 2002) (the law of the case doctrine stands for the proposition that ""when a court decides 
upon a rule of law, that decision should continue to govern the same issues in subsequent stages in the same case"") (quoting 
Christianson v. Colt Indus. Operating Corp., 486 U.S. 800, 816, 108 S. Ct. 2166, 100 L. Ed. 2d 811, (1988)). The doctrine is 
designed to ""promote finality, consistency, and judicial economy."" Hamilton, 322 F.3d at 787. As the Third Circuit has explained: "
1166,," The law of the case doctrine does not limit a federal court's power; rather, it directs its exercise of discretion. … A court has 
the power to revisit prior decisions  [**47] of its own or of a coordinate court in any circumstance, although as a rule courts 
should be loathe to do so in the absence of extraordinary circumstances such as where the initial decision was clearly 
erroneous and would work a manifest injustice. This Circuit has recognized several ""extraordinary circumstances"" that 
warrant a court's reconsideration of an issue decided earlier in the course of litigation. They include situations in which: (1) 
new evidence is available; (2) a supervening new law has been announced; or (3) the earlier decision was clearly 
erroneous and would create manifest injustice. Pub. Interest Research Group of N.J., Inc. v. Magnesium Elektron, Inc., 123 F.3d 111, 116-17 (3d Cir. 1997) (internal citations 
omitted)."
1166,19," While additional facts and evidence may have developed since Judge Lifland issued the December 22 Opinion, a review of 
Purepac's Amended Answer indicates that Purepac has provided additional allegations concerning the antitrust injuries it has 
suffered, and in support of its standing to pursue them, beyond those that Judge Lifland initially deemed sufficient. "
1167,20," Warner-Lambert explains that Remeron, for example, involved the late listing of a patent in the Orange Book in violation of 
regulatory requirements, 335 F. Supp. 2d at 532; LePage's Inc. v. 3M involved exclusive dealing arrangements and bundled 
rebates which were both illegal exclusionary conduct, 324 F.3d 141, 154, 157 (3d Cir. 2003); Continental Ore involved an illegal 
group boycott, 370 U.S. at 698-99; and Aspen Highland Skiing Corp. v. Aspen Skiing  [**52] Co. involved a refusal to deal. 738 
F.2d 1509 (10th Cir. 1984), aff'd, 472 U.S. 585, 105 S. Ct. 2847, 86 L. Ed. 2d 467 (1985)."
1167,21," See also SmithKline Beecham Corp. v. Apotex Corp., 383 F. Supp. 2d 686, 702 (E.D. Pa. 2004) (denying motion to dismiss 
antitrust counterclaims based on a ""larger scheme to maintain [a] monopoly,"" because of the court's obligation to ""consider the 
anticompetitive effect of [plaintiff's] acts as a whole,"" even though certain elements of the scheme did not independently 
 [**54] produce an antitrust injury); Kobe, Inc. v. Dempsey Pump Co., 198 F.2d 416, 425 (10th Cir. 1952) (""The infringement 
action and the related activities, of course, in themselves were not unlawful, and standing alone would not be sufficient to sustain 
a claim for damages which they may have caused, but when considered with the entire monopolistic scheme which preceded 
them we think, as the trial court did, that they may be considered as having been done to give effect to the unlawful scheme.""); 
Biovail Corp., 49 F. Supp. 2d at 766. "
1168,22," Purepac has, moreover, sufficiently alleged that some of the activities that make up the challenged monopolization scheme 
may constitute independent antitrust violations. See Sections III.C.5.b, c, below."
1168,23," Warner-Lambert does not move to dismiss Purepac's allegations of improper Orange Book listings on immunity grounds, 
arguing instead that Purepac's claims based on improper listing of the '476 and '479 Patents fail because both listings were 
proper as a matter of law. This approach is consistent with case law establishing that the listing of patents in the Orange Book is 
not government petitioning as defined  [**57] by the Noerr-Pennington doctrine and therefore not eligible for Noerr-Pennington 
immunity. In re Buspirone Patent Litig., 185 F. Supp. 2d 363, 372-73 (S.D.N.Y. 2002) (""[L]isting [patents in the Orange Book] is 
much more like the filing of a tariff than the kind of conduct through which private parties seek to influence governmental 
decision making and that has traditionally been immunized under the Noerr-Pennington doctrine. … This conduct is therefore not 
immune from liability under the Sherman Act."") (""Buspirone""); Mylan, 293 F. Supp. 2d at 458-59 (""This Court finds that filing a 
patent for listing in the Orange Book is not 'petitioning activity' within the meaning of the Noerr-Pennington doctrine because the 
FDA's action in listing Organon's '099 patent in the Orange Book was not an independent governmental determination, but rather 
a purely ministerial function.""). The Court need not address Warner-Lambert's challenges to Purepac's improper listing 
allegations because, as just discussed, the propriety or lawfulness of the predicate activities of a monopolization scheme do not 
determine whether the scheme itself is actionable or unlawful. Nonetheless, the Court notes that Purepac  [**58] has amply pled that Warner-Lambert listed the '476 and '479 Patents in the 
Orange Book with anticompetitive purpose and effect. Judge Lifland allowed Purepac to pursue improper listing claims on the 
basis of its original pleadings. December 22 Opinion, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22559, 2000 WL 34213890, at *6-7. The Court finds 
similarly sufficient allegations in its Amended Answer. Viewing such allegations in the light most favorable to Purepac, discovery could demonstrate fraudulent, anticompetitive, or 
improper conduct by Warner-Lambert that proves that these listings were made in furtherance of an overall scheme to 
monopolize. Purepac is entitled to attempt to meet its burden of proof by developing facts that will show that the listings were "
1169,," improper because they did not cover the drugs or uses in the NDA and because a claim of patent infringement could not be 
reasonably asserted against the generic applicants. Warner-Lambert's arguments that such listings were proper as a matter of 
law address the merits of Purepac's claims, rather than the sufficiency of the pleadings. Because Warner-Lambert's Orange 
Book listings for the '476 and '479 Patents are not eligible for Noerr-Pennington immunity and because Purepac  [**59] has 
adequately alleged that such listings were a part of an overall pattern of abuse of the Hatch-Waxman regulatory process, these 
allegations are properly included within the scope of the alleged monopolization scheme at issue. Warner-Lambert's arguments 
would be better addressed at the summary judgment stage than upon a motion to dismiss. "
1170,24," As the Supreme Court further explained in PRE: The existence of probable cause to institute legal proceedings precludes a finding that an antitrust defendant has engaged 
in sham litigation. The notion of probable cause, as understood and applied in the common law tort of wrongful civil 
proceedings, requires the plaintiff to prove that the defendant lacked  [**63] probable cause to institute an unsuccessful civil 
lawsuit and that the defendant pressed the action for an improper, malicious purpose. Probable cause to institute civil 
proceedings requires no more than a ""reasonabl[e] belie[f] that there is a chance that [a] claim may be held valid upon 
adjudication."" … When a court has found that an antitrust defendant claiming Noerr immunity had probable cause to sue, 
that finding compels the conclusion that a reasonable litigant in the defendant's position could realistically expect success 
on the merits of the challenged lawsuit. Under our decision today, therefore, a proper probable cause determination 
irrefutably demonstrates that an antitrust plaintiff has not proved the objective prong of the sham exception and that the 
defendant is accordingly entitled to Noerr immunity. Id. at 62 (internal citations omitted)."
1170,25," In support of this argument, Warner-Lambert cites a long list of prior rulings: (1) Warner-Lambert Co. v. Purepac Pharm. Co., 
Nos. 98-2749, 98-5948, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24369, 2003 WL 21698310, at *1 (D.N.J. May 22, 2003) (stating on denial of a 
motion for attorneys' fees that ""there is insufficient evidence to support a conclusion that Warner-Lambert's claim of infringement 
was unreasonable or that its listing in the Orange Book was improper.""); (2) Warner-Lambert Co. v. Apotex Corp., No. 98-4293, 
2003 WL 21754948, at *4 (N.D. Ill. July 28, 2003) (rejecting a motion for fees and Rule 11 sanctions and observing that Warner-

that ""TorPharm has not demonstrated that Warner-Lambert initiated a frivolous suit with respect to this claim,"" and that Warner-

Apotex Corp., No. 98-4293, 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6208, 1999 WL 259946, at *3, *6 (N.D. Ill. Apr. 8, 1999) (denying a motion for

submitted sufficient evidence to avoid summary judgment); and (5) Warner-Lambert Co. v. Purepac Pharm. Co., No. 98-2749, 
1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 23378, *12 (D.N.J. Aug. 26, 1999) (denying summary judgment on the inducement claim because there 
were genuine issues of fact as to ""whether Purepac will knowingly and actively induce infringement of the patent.""). "

July 31, 2008) (holding that defendant had sufficiently alleged the elements necessary to plead sham litigation and that, as a 
result, plaintiff was not entitled to immunity at the ""preliminary stage of  [**68] the action,"" but explaining that ""upon litigation of 
the patent infringement claims and upon discovery as to Defendant's Counterclaims, if Defendant does not bear its burden of 
proof as to a 'sham' litigation, Plaintiff may seek anew Noerr-Pennington immunity.""). "
1172,27," Warner-Lambert does, however, assert that ""[m]uch has changed since 2000,""  [**71] and attempts to point the Court to the 
subsequent decisions denying Rule 11 motions and allegedly finding that Warner-Lambert's infringement claims were not 
objectively baseless. Plaintiffs' Reply Brief at 26. As noted above, these decisions are not dispositive where, as here, Purepac 
disputes some of the predicate facts underlying the actions in which those decisions were issued."
1172,28," The Court notes, however, that after litigation of Warner-Lambert's patent infringement claims and upon discovery as to 
Purepac's counterclaims, if Purepac is unable to meet its burden of proof as to the sham exception, Plaintiffs may renew their 
claims for Noerr-Pennington  [**72] immunity. "
1173,29," The Court notes again that if Purepac is unable to meet its burden of proof as to the sham exception, Plaintiffs may renew 
their  [**77] claims for Noerr-Pennington immunity at a later stage of the proceeding. "
1174,30," The FTC has recently applied a similar analysis to claims of systematic abuse of the Hatch-Waxman regulatory framework, in 
evaluating a complaint that Bristol-Myers Squibb (""BMS"") had engaged in a scheme to obstruct the launch of generic 
competitors to its BuSpar, Taxol, and Platinol drug products. Faced with imminent competition for these drugs, BMS allegedly 
undertook a course of conduct that included: paying potential competitors to abandon a challenge to a BMS patent and stay off 
 [**79] the market until the patent expired; abusing FDA regulations to block generic entry; making false statements to the FDA 
in connection with listing patents in the Orange Book; engaging in inequitable conduct before the PTO to obtain patents; and 
filing baseless patent infringement suits. The FTC expressed concerns with such conduct, explaining that: the logic and policy underlying the Supreme Court's decision in California Motor Transport Co. v. Trucking Unlimited, 404 
U.S. 508, 92 S. Ct. 609, 30 L. Ed. 2d 642 (1972), which held a pattern of filings undertaken without regard to their merits to 
be outside the protections of Noerr, supports the application of a pattern exception for BMS's alleged pattern of conduct 
across its buspirone, paclitaxel, and cisplatin products, and thus provides a separate reason to reject Noerr immunity here. 
As is reflected in the complaint, the overall course of conduct challenged here constitutes a clear and systematic pattern of 
anticompetitive misuse of governmental processes, that is, abusive filings undertaken without regard to the merits, in order 
to use administrative and judicial processes - rather than the outcome of those processes - as a weapon to obstruct 
competition. Just as  [**80] the repeated filing of lawsuits brought without regard to the merits, and for the purpose of using 
the judicial process (as opposed to the outcome of the process), warrants rejection of Noerr immunity, so too do the alleged 
repeated filing of patents on the Orange Book without regard to their validity, enforceability, or listability; repeated filing of 
recklessly or deliberately false statements with government agencies; and filing of lawsuits brought with or without regard to 
the merits, also cause the actions challenged here to fall outside the scope of Noerr's protection. Analysis to Aid Public Comment, In re Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., No. C-4076 (F.T.C. Mar. 7, 2003), available at

course of conduct before the Patent Office with respect to the '482 Patent. "

] The Sherman Act was adopted to provide against combinations or conspiracies in restraint of trade or commerce, the 
monopolization of trade or commerce, or attempts to monopolize the same. D.R. Wilder Mfg. Co. v. Corn Product Refining Co., 
236 U.S. 165, 173-74, 35 S.Ct. 398, 401, 59 L.Ed. 520 (1915). The Federal Trade Commission Act was designed to supplement 
and bolster the Sherman Act and the Clayton Act. Federal Trade Commission v. Motion Picture Advertising Service Co., 344 
U.S. 392, 394, 73 S. Ct. 361, 363, 97 L. Ed. 426, 49 F.T.C. 1730 (1953). "
1187,9," Similarly, in Kottle v. Northwest Kidney Centers, 146 F.3d 1056, the court indicated that HN14[
] misrepresentations made in 
an administrative-type proceeding are not protected by the Noerr-Pennington doctrine, but found that the allegations in the 
complaint were insufficient to avoid dismissal. Likewise, in Whelan v. Abell, 48 F.3d 1247, 310 U.S. App. D.C. 396 (D.C. Cir. 
1995), the court found that neither Noerr-Pennington nor the First Amendment  [**24] protects the conduct plaintiffs alleged 
therein-namely, knowing misrepresentations to state securities administrators and a federal court."
1187,10," Moreover, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, in a case addressing the interplay between 
Louisiana's regulation of casino gaming  [**26] and the Noerr-Pennington and Parker doctrines, recently recognized the fraud 
exception as enunciated in Woods Exploration, but found it inapplicable therein. See Jebaco, Inc. v. Harrah's Operating Co., 
Inc., 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16775, 2008 WL 638618 (E.D. La. 2008). "
1188,11," Louisiana Revised Statute 4:558 was redesignated as LSA-R.S. 27:99 by 1996 La. Acts, No. 7, § 3, 1st Ex. Sess. and later 
repealed by 2001 La. Acts, No. 1222, § 2, effective July 2, 2001. The latter act also enacted LSA-R.S. 27:30, a provision 
substantially similar to LSA-R.S. 27:99."
1188,12," The court also indicated that it is a bit of a misnomer to refer to the right to petition as the Noerr-Pennington immunity doctrine 
in a non-antitrust  [**31] case. Rather, it is more appropriate to refer to the immunity as Noerr-Pennington immunity only when 
applied to antitrust claims. Id. at 889. "
1189,13," The majority in Armstrong distinguished the Fifth Circuit's decision in Woods Exploration, 438 F.2d 1286, on the basis that 
the regulators played no role in reviewing or approving the false data submitted to the state by the defendant."
1189,14," See former LSA-R.S. 4:536(A)(2), which was redesignated as LSA-R.S. 27:76(2) by 1996 La. Acts, No. 7, § 3, 1st Ex. Sess. 
and later repealed by 2001 La. Acts, No. 1222, § 2, effective July 2, 2001. "
1190,15," Wilday represented to the Division that he was ""paid in full for [his] design and consulting services"" rendered to Jazz and that 
he was paid $ 150,908.34. However, Capitol House notes that Jazz paid Wilday a total of $ 2,200,000 after Wilday represented 
to the Division that he was ""paid in full."" Additionally, Capitol  [**40] House questions whether Wilday had an ownership interest 
in Jazz, but the evidence presented at trial falls short of evidencing any ownership agreement between Wilday and Jazz. "
1192,16," Jazz was only a 10 percent partner in the venture and bore no responsibility whatsoever to fund the cost of the riverboat and 
its dock."
1192,17," Perryman also testified that Argosy did eventually complete a modified form of the Catfish Town project. Although the hotel 
was substantially smaller than what was proposed and was built later than the anticipated deadline, Perryman indicated that the 
hotel Argosy actually built was approximately 65 percent of the size of the one proposed, so his firm ""came pretty close on that 
one."""
1192,18," Moreover, Capitol House has no right to bring a criminal action against defendants, and its right and/or cause of action in tort 
against the defendants is also questionable. "
1201,1," As the background information underlying this case has not changed over the last year and a half, the following recitation of the 
facts is largely taken from the Court's March 24, 2008 Order. See In re ATM Fee Antitrust Litig., 554 F. Supp. 2d 1003, 1007-09 
(N.D. Cal. 2008). "
1204,2," The direct purchaser rule does not apply to equitable relief, see Lucas Auto. Eng'g, Inc. v. Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc., 140 F.3d 
1228, 1235 (9th Cir. 1988), which is also sought by Plaintiffs. "
1213,3," Plaintiffs argue that the Court should not consider the Smith Declaration filed with BANA's motion because it constitutes 
extrinsic evidence. Extrinsic evidence cannot be considered on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(d). 
However, Defendants' motion is also a challenge to the amendment under Rule 15. At a case management conference on 
December 5, 2008, the Court stated it would allow Plaintiffs leave to amend without requiring them to file a motion. However, the 
Court also stated that Defendants would be entitled to raise any arguments in their challenge to the new complaint that could 
 [**55] have been raised in opposing the amendment under Rule 15. Accordingly, the Court may consider the extrinsic evidence 
in regard to the challenge to the amendment. "
1236,1," The Complaint alleges the Court has jurisdiction over the state law claim pursuant to the recently enacted Class Action 
Fairness Act of 2005 (""CAFA"") codified at 28 U.S.C. § 1332(d). ECF No. 36 at P 8. HN2[
] CAFA expanded federal jurisdiction 
over putative class actions lawsuits in which the amount in controversy exceeds $ 5 million. More specifically, in the context of 
such lawsuits, CAFA relaxed the complete diversity requirement in favor of ""minimal diversity,"" requiring only that one plaintiff 
class member be diverse from one defendant. 28 U.S.C. § 1332(d)(2). Mindful of its obligation to determine whether the Court 
would retain jurisdiction of the state law claim after dismissal of the federal claim, the undersigned found no CAFA exceptions to 
be a bar to jurisdiction. See also note 23, infra."
1236,2," See In re Industrial Life Insurance Litigation, 148 F. Supp.2d 719, 722 (E.D. La. 2001) (finding that neither the filed rate doctrine 
nor the McCarran-Ferguson Act erect jurisdictional bars and distinguishing, on other grounds, Dana Corp. v. Blue Cross & Blue 
Shield Mutual of Northern Ohio, 900 F.2d 882, 888 (6th Cir. 1990) (affirming denial of 12(b)(1) motion for lack of jurisdiction) as 
not having a McCarran-Ferguson issue and merely turning on questions related to Ohio administrative process while vaguely 
mentioning the Act); Phelps v. Nationwide Ins. Co., 37 Fed. Appx. 752 **2 (finding the McCarran-Ferguson Act does not provide 
an independent basis for federal jurisdiction); Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Wooster Brush Co.,1980 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 16100, 1980 WL 279, *1-2 (N.D. Ohio Nov. 25, 1980) (finding motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction 
pursuant to 12(b)(1) was mischaracterized given that dismissal pursuant to the McCarran-Ferguson act is merit-based, not 
jurisdictional so recharacterized as a 12(b)(6))."
1236,3," Defendants only mentioned ""12(b)(1)""once  [**20] in their otherwise thorough pleadings. See ECF No. 43 at 8. Even then no 
standard of review was suggested, creating the impression that Defendants are not firmly wedded to a 12(b)(1) dismissal."
1236,4," If the dismissal is granted without prejudice, as recommended, opportunities for injunctive relief may survive as discussed in 
greater detail below. "
1237,5," HN4[
] Case law is silent as to the file rate doctrine's effect on prayers for declaratory relief. Logic, however, dictates that the 
filed rate doctrine applies to filed rates not those which have not yet been filed, i.e. those to be filed in the future. See also note 
33,, infra."
1237,6," Judge Dowd consolidated the following cases: 1:08-CV-00678,1:08-CV-00741, 4:08-CV-00750, 1:08-CV-00803, 1:08-CV-
01021, 5:08-CV-01289, and 1:08-CV-01836. See ECF No. 37. Civil action 1:08-CV-677 is the Lead Case. See ECF No. 37."
1237,7," Specifically, Plaintiffs have named the following title insurance  [**22] companies as defendants: Fidelity National Title 
Insurance Company, Chicago Title Insurance Company, Ticor Title Insurance Company, Security Union Title Insurance 
Company, Ticor Title Insurance Company of Florida, First American Title Insurance Company, United General Title Insurance 
Company, Ohio Bar Title Insurance Company, Port Lawrence Title and Trust Company, T.A. Title Insurance Company, Censtar 
Title Insurance Company, Commonwealth Land Title Insurance Company, Lawyers Title Insurance Corporation, Transnation 
Title Insurance Company, Stewart Title Guaranty Company, National Land Title Insurance Company, and Old Republic National 
Title Insurance Company. The parent corporation Defendants are Fidelity National Financial, Inc. (P 12), First American 
Corporation (P 14), Land America Financial Group, Inc.(P16), Stewart Information Services Corporation (P 18), and Old 
Republic International Corporation (P 20)."
1237,8," In Ohio, title insurers are permitted to become members of a rating bureau in order to submit rates to ODI for approval. O.R.C. 
§ 3935.04(B). Ratings Bureaus are licensed by ODI and membership is not required. O.R.C. §§ 3935.04 & 3953.28. A rating 
bureau submits rates on behalf of its members for approval by ODI and must charge only those rates approved by ODI, which 
become the filed rate. O.R.C. §§ 3935.04 & .07. "
1238,9," In light of the undersigned's recommendation of dismissal of the entire matter on other grounds, it unnecessary to rule upon the 
challenges to personal jurisdiction and venue, i.e., the 12(b)(2) and (3) motions. See Weber v. National Football League, 112 F. 
Supp.2d 667, 671 (N.D.Ohio 2000)(dismissing Sherman Act claims under Fed. R. Civ.P. 12(b)(6) and noting that ""it would be 
premature to examine the . . . defendants' objections to jurisdiction and venue of those claims without first making a 
determination of whether plaintiff has stated a claim under antitrust statutes in the first instance"")."
1238,10," As noted above, all other motions to dismiss, e.g. Stewart Information Services Corporation's motion to dismiss for lack of 
personal jurisdiction, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(2) and ORI's motions pursuant to 12(b)(2) and (3) should 
be denied as moot, given the undersigned recommendations of dismissals on other grounds. See ECF No. 40."
1238,11," In Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1953, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009), HN7[
] the Supreme Court made it clear that ""[o]ur 
decision in Twombly expounded the pleading standard for 'all civil actions,' and it applies  [**28] to antitrust and discrimination 
suits alike."" "
1239,12," As explained above, the undersigned believes the 12(b)(1) to be a mischaracterization. Nevertheless, out of an abundance of 
caution, the standard of review pursuant to 12(b)(1) is provided. HN11[
] The standard of review for a facial challenge such as 
that mounted in the instant case, essentially mirrors that of a 12(b)(6) motion."
1239,13," At oral argument, defense counsel agreed th at its joint Rule 12(b)(1) motion presents a facial rather than factual attack on the 
Complaint. ECF No. 95 at 79 lines 6-7 (""In either case, we're looking just at the face of the pleadings.) (Attorney Coleman). "
1240,14," Regarding a 12(b)(1) motion, a conversion to a factual attack would eliminate the presumptive truthfulness which otherwise 
attaches to Plaintiffs' allegations and permit evidence to be weighed in order to resolve factual disputes. See Wenz v. Rossford 
Ohio Transp. Improvement Dist., 392 F. Supp.2d 931, 934 (N.D. Ohio 2005).  [**33] Although HN15[
] the Rule 12(b)(1) standard of review permits (under certain circumstances) the Court to resolve factual disputes, that opportunity is something the 
undersigned finds unnecessary in the instant case and notes that the task was not requested by either party, given that Plaintiffs' 
posed no objection either orally or in writing to Defendants' prescribed limited use of its attached Exhibits."
1240,15," Regarding the motion for dismissal due to the McCarran-Ferguson Act, the undersigned notes that Plaintiffs' references to the 
Motter Deposition (although not exclusively) are focused on her testimony about Bulletin 91-1, a document publicly available. 
And, as Plaintiffs' indicate, Bulletin 91-1 speaks for itself. See ECF 77 at 34 n.26."
1240,16," Although first applied to an antitrust case in Keogh, the origin of the filed rate doctrine can be traced back to the Supreme 
Court's ruling in Texas & Pacific Railway v. Abilene Cotton Oil Co., 204 U.S. 426, 27 S. Ct. 350, 51 L. Ed. 553 (1907) in which "
1241,," the Court addressed the issue of whether a shipper could maintain a common law action for damages against a common carrier 
for ""the exaction of an alleged unreasonable rate, although the rate collected and complained of was the rate stated in the 
schedule filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission."" Id. at 436. The Court reasoned that the existence of the shipper's 
right to recover damages due to the unreasonableness of the established rate was ""wholly inconsistent with the administrative 
power conferred upon the [ICC],  [**36] and with the duty, which the [Interstate Commerce Act] casts upon that body, of seeing 
to it that the statutory requirement as to uniformity and equality of rates is observed."" Id. at 440-41."
1241,17," In the instant matter, the rates Plaintiffs  [**37] complain of are the only rates Defendants are permitted to charge, given they 
are the only filed rates. See O.R.C. § 3935.04(H). "
1242,18," Recognizing the ""powerful role"" of an award of treble damages, the Supreme Court has acknowledged that ""[t]he treble 
damages provision wielded by the private litigant is a chief tool in the antitrust enforcement scheme, posing a crucial deterrent to 
potential violators. [] Granting this role its due respect, however, a critical  [**42] distinction remains between an absolute 
immunity from all antitrust scrutiny and a far more limited nonavailability of the private trebledamages remedy."" Square D Co., 
476 U.S. at 422 n.28 (internal citations and quotations omitted). "
1243,19," Such cases include the following. See e.g., Texas Commercial Energy v. TXU Energy, Inc., 413 F.3d 503 (5th Cir. 2005) 
(doctrine barred both state and federal antitrust claims based on rates filed with a state regulatory agency); Coll v. First Am. Title 
Ins. Co., No. CIV 06-348, Dkt. No.141, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 112855 (D.N.M. Apr. 21, 2008) (doctrine barred state law claims 
based on title insurance rates filed with a state insurance department) (ECF 43-2); Fersco v. Empire Blue Cross/Blue Shield of 
New York, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11479, 1994 WL 445730 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 17, 1994) (doctrine barred both state  [**47] and 
federal claims based on rates filed with a state insurance department); Amundson & Assocs. Art Studio, Ltd. v. National Council

1998) (adopting ""filed rate"" doctrine under North Carolina law; complaint was that insurers withheld information from regulator, 
forcing plaintiffs to pay more for insurance); Minihane v. Weissman, 226 A.D.2d 152, 640 N.Y.S. 2d 102 (N.Y. App. Div. 1996); 
Prentice v. Title Insurance Co., 176 Wis.2d 714, 500 N.W.2d 658 (Wis. 1993), cert. Denied, 510 U.S. 1113, 114 S. Ct. 1058, 127

Teleconnect Co. v. U.S. West Commc'ns, Inc., 508 N.W.2d 644, 648-649 (Iowa 1993) (similar). "
1244,20," See Knevelbaard Dairies v. Kraft Foods, Inc., 232 F.3d 979 (9th Cir. 2000) (finding, with respect to state antitrust law and 
rate filed before state agency, question of filed rate immunity is purely one of state law; in this case, California recognized a 
narrower immunity than federal law does; following Cellular Plus, Inc., v. Superior Court, 14 Cal. App. 4th 1224, 18 Cal.Rptr.2d 
308 (Cal. App. 4th Dist. 1993)  [**48] (refusing to follow Keogh and Square D and finding that denying standing would ""implicitly . 
. . encourage[] regulated companies to engage in anticompetitive price fixing activities."") "
1245,21," The undersigned has not found, nor have Defendants or Plaintiffs cited, any Ohio court applying the filed rate doctrine to 
Ohio's title insurance regime."
1245,22," Cf. Barnes v. First Am. Title Ins. Co., 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 54984, 2006 WL 2265553 (N.D. Ohio 2006) and Chesner v. 
Stewart Title Guaranty Co., 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 57356, 2006 WL 2252542 (N.D.Ohio 2006) are both cases in which 
defendant title insurance companies unsuccessfully tried to defeat allegations of constructive fraud by retorting that the filed rate 
doctrine ""creates a presumption of knowledge of the rate filed and discount rate by the consumer"" satisfying the defendant's 
need to ""disclose the availability of the discount  [**54] rate in the filing of its rate manual."" Barnes, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 54984, 
2006 WL 2265553 at *7; Chesner, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 57356, 2006 WL 2252542 at *7. The court declined to apply the filed 
rate doctrine. Neither Barnes or Chesner are persuasive or binding authority over this Court. To the extent either decision 
regards the filed rate doctrine, both Barnes and Chesner relies on a decision that (even at the time those decisions were 
rendered) had no precedential value given that it had been vacated after the district court realized it did not have jurisdiction. 
See Zangara v. Travelers Indemnity Co. of Am., 423 F.Supp.2d 762, 776, vac'd by 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14218, 2006 WL 
825231 (N.D.Ohio). Moreover, to the extent either Barnes or Chesner is mistaken as serving as an important datum of this 
District's law, the undersigned notes that both cases narrowly restricted the application of the filed rate doctrine, in direct 
contradiction to the Sixth Circuit's ruling in Pinney Dock wherein the Sixth Circuit explicitly states that it does ""not believe that 
either Keogh or Square D was intended to be limited solely to antitrust damage claims brought by shippers."" Pinney Dock, 838 
F.2d at 1456 (foretelling the possible application of the filed rate doctrine to non-shipper  [**55] related antitrust matters)."
1245,23," Because Count Two presents a state antitrust  [**56] statute challenge to a state-regulated title insurance rate, a matter of first 
impression for this Circuit. The undersigned presents without recommending, that the Court stay the ruling on the entire matter 
pending certification to the Ohio Supreme Court the questions of (1) Whether the Filed Rate Doctrine applies to Ohio's Title "
1246,," Insurance [] regime and/or (2) Whether the Filed Rate Doctrine applies to a state antitrust challenge to a rate regulated by state 
law. The prospect of certifying the broad question of the applicability of the Filed Rate Doctrine to the Ohio Supreme Court was 
raised by Judge Dowd on June 24, 2008 during a case management conference wherein all parties were represented. At that 
time, Bruce Cohen, counsel for Plaintiff Mintz, and Deborah Coleman, designated Defense Counsel Liason agreed that the 
Valentine Act is interpreted consistently with the Sherman Act. ECF No. 33 Tr. at 23-24 (Lapatine, counsel for First American 
Corp.). And, attorney Cohen added that he did not think certification to the Ohio Supreme Court necessary in this case. ECF No. 
33 Tr. at 24 (""I don't think it's necessary here, Your Honor. I think this [C]ourt is certainly competent to rule on  [**57] a matter 
like that in the context of a Sherman Act case.""). Because (as discussed above) CAFA confers diversity jurisdiction, the Court 
has no basis to ""decline supplemental jurisdiction"" of the Count Two, the state antitrust claim, upon dismissal of Count One, 
unless the class status of the Plaintiffs were at issue, making it unlikely that Plaintiffs could maintain a diversity action."
1246,24," See ECF No. 99 (Letter dated June 22, 2009 from Plaintiff's counsel, Daniel B. Allanoff) (urging that the application of the Filed 
Rate Doctrine hinges on meaningful review of rate filings; see also ECF No. 97 (Letter from Allanoff dated July 20, 2009 (citing 
McCray, 636 F.Supp.2d 322, 2009 WL 2170694 (same)."
1246,25," Recognizing the strength of the Keogh decision, the Square D Court noted ""[s]tare decisis is usually the wise policy because in 
most matters, it is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be settled right."" Square D Co., 476 U.S. 
at 424 (quoting Justice Brandieis a decade after his Keogh decision). Similarly, that Court recounted that [m]ore than any other 
doctrine in the field of precedent, [stare decisis] has served to limit the freedom of the court."" Id at n.34 (quoting Levi, An 
Introduction to Legal Reasoning, 15 U.Chi.L.Rev. 501, 540 (1948)). "
1247,26," In Randleman, albeit in dicta, another branch of this Court characterized Ohio's title insurance scheme as ""Comprehensive"" in 
deciding that the Court had jurisdiction over Plaintiffs' claims. Randleman v. Fidelity Nat'l Title Ins., 465 F. Supp.2d 812, 817 
(N.D. Ohio 2006)."
1247,27," Each defendant except the corporate parent defendants ""submits its title insurance rates collectively through OTIRB."" ECF No. 
36 P 40."
1247,28," Plaintiffs' also rely on Hanson v. Acceleration Life Ins. Co., 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 23298, 1999 WL 33283345 (D.N.D. Mar. 20, 
1999) (finding that statutory language was inconsistent with the establishment of a filed rate obviating the application of the filed 
rate doctrine). "
1248,29," HN47[
] The Ninth Circuit has declined to apply the doctrine if the rates to be challenged resulted from unlawful activity prior 
to the filing. See e.g., Brown v. Ticor Title, 982 F.2d at 394; Blaylock, 504 F.Supp.2d at 1102. "
1250,30," Bulletin 91-1, which Plaintiff's concede in legally non-binding, is publicly available online. ECF 77 No. at 10 (""In any case

appropriate for the taking of judicial notice.""); see also F.R.E. 201(c) (""A court shall take judicial notice, whether requested or 
not.""). Because this title insurance related document is integral to Plaintiffs' allegations, the Court takes judicial notice. 
Defendants have not objected to Plaintiffs' introduction of Bulleting 91-1 nor challenged its authenticity. The lack of objection 
from Defendants satisfies any concern the undersigned might have had regarding its reliance on the proffered document which 
is obviously integral to Plaintiffs' allegations of Defendant's non-compliance with Ohio's title insurance laws. The proffered 
document may also be admissible as a public record. "
1251,32," Paragraph 29 augurs the discriminatory damages award the filed rate doctrine was created to prevent. ECF No. 36 P 29 
(""Except as to the amount of damages each member of the Class has by itself sustained . . ."")."
1251,33," A similar argument can be made in support of declaratory relief. See also Pinney Dock, 838 F.2d at 1482. "
1253,34," Defendants directed the Court's attention to  [**86] Coll v. First Am. Title Ins. Co., No. CIV 06-348, Dkt. No.141, 2008 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 112855 (D.N.M. Apr. 21, 2008) (stating the purpose of New Mexico's Title Insurance Law ""is to provide a 
comprehensive body of law for the effective regulation and active supervision of the business of title insurance transacted [] in 
response to the McCarran-Ferguson Act."") (ECF 43-2 at 17) "
1254,35," Plaintiffs characterize Defendants' co-conspirators as ""various title insurers, not named as defendants herein, which were 
members of OTIRB during all or part of the class period."" ECF No. 36 at 10 P 25. "
1255,36," The role of the corporate parent defendant is discussed in Section C, infra."
1255,37," Curiously, Plaintiffs state in their Complaint that Ohio law regulates title insurance. See ECF No. 36 at 15 P 47 (""Ohio Revised 
Code § 3935.03(B), which regulates title insurance . . . ."")."
1255,38," Please also see text above regarding ODI's ""Meaningful or Comprehensive Review."" "
1256,39," Old Republic International Corporation (""ORI"") is the ultimate parent company of Old Republic National Title Insurance 
Company (""ORNTIC""). See ECF No. 41-2 at 17 n.6. Both ORI and ORNTIC are named defendants. ORI, a self-described 
""insurance holding company,"" separately moved for the dismissal of the entire Comnplaint due to Plaintiffs' failure to state a 
claim ""under either the Sherman Act or the Valentine Act, because [the Complaint] does not allege facts which could support a 
finding that ORI itself, as opposed to  [**95] ORI's corporate 'affiliates,' was involved in the alleged conspiracy to fix Ohio title 
insurance rates."" ECF No. 41-2 at 7; see also ECF No. 36 at PP 19,20. ORI along with the other corporate parent defendants 
joined all other defendants to dismiss pursuant to the Filed Rate Doctrine and McCarran-Ferguson Act (ECF No. 43), as 
discussed earlier. See ECF Nos. 40 & 66 at 6 n.1."
1256,40," Plaintiffs offer ""that this conduct by the title insurance companies is not limited to Ohio. Plaintiffs believe that, in every state in 
which there is a rating bureau for title insurance, there is an identical horizontal price fix. It is unlikely that this conduct would 
have uniformly occurred absent coordination and control by the ultimate parents of the operating company defendants."" ECF 
No.88 at 3 n.1. "
1257,41," Of course this does not immunize corporate actors from Sherman Act scrutiny; it does however dictate that any post-
acquisition scrutiny  [**99] falls outside of the reach of § 1 (conspiracy)."
1257,42," The Complaint alleges the title insurance defendants are ""wholly owned"" and/or ""controlled"" by their various parent 
corporation. See ECF No. 36 at PP 12, 14, 16, 18, and 20."
1257,43," Plaintiffs allege that some corporate parent defendants wholly own and control their subsidiaries (e.g., P 18), while others 
wholly own and/or control their subsidiaries, (e.g ., P 20). For the purposes of this motion, the court will read the Complaint in the 
light most favorable to Plaintiffs and presume that all corporate defendant parents wholly own and control their title insurance 
subsidiaries. "
1258,44," In reply to ORI's Motion to Dismiss, Plaintiffs argues that they ""specifically alleged that ORI [for example] agreed to its 
subsidiary's participation with non-related entities in the conspiracy set forth in the [Complaint]."" ECF No. 64 at 39. The 
undersigned has found no language in the Complaint alleging a specific agreement. And, assuming arguendo, were such 
language present, the Copperweld issue of whether a parent can agree or conspire with its subsidiary would still loom."
1258,45," Plaintiffs essentially concede that a failure to state a Sherman Act claim would also constitute a failure to state a claim under 
Ohio's Valentine Act. ECF No. 64 at 40. The Court concurs."
1258,46," LandAmerica Financial Group, Inc., one of the corporate defendants, has filed bankruptcy. Because the recommendation is for 
a dismissal of all allegations against LandAmerica Financial Group, Inc., the undersigned recognizes the awkward position the 
automatic stay (ECF No. 60) due poses for all who are bound by it. The undersigned, therefore, recommends that, in the interest 
of due process to all parties, unless or until the Court receives evidence that the stay has been lifted or modified, the dismissal 
should be stayed as to defendant LandAmerica Financial Group, Inc. "
1259,47," As noted above, the parent corporations include, Fidelity National Financial (P 12), First American Corporation (P 14), 
LandAmerica Financial Group, Inc.(P16), Stewart Information Services Corporation (P 18), and Old Republic International 
Corporation (P 20). "
1261,1," The facts of this case are fully set forth in this Court's Memorandum Opinion entered on August 29, 2008 [Docket No 59]. 
Familiarity with such facts and terms defined therein is assumed. "
1264,2," The Court notes that Counterclaimants' motion for partial summary judgment, filed on February 4, 2009 is also currently 
pending. [Docket No. 71.] This Court will address that motion in a separately filed memorandum opinion. "
1265,3," The Counterclaimants allegations with respect to tying and PBX systems are found at paragraphs 343 to 367 of the Proposed 
Counterclaims, while the allegations regarding tying and PDS systems are located at paragraphs 393 to 417 of the Proposed 
Counterclaims. "
1266,4," The Court notes that only Counterclaimant Continuant asserts the Fifth through Eighth Causes of Action asserted in the 
Proposed Counterclaims. (Proposed Counterclaims PP 368-417.) "
1269,5," ""[A] third standard that falls somewhere between the rule of reason and per se standards"" is the ""quick look"" rule of reason. 
Rossi v. Standard Roofing, Inc., 156 F.3d 452, 461 n.6 (3d Cir. 1998). This method ""applies in cases where per se 
condemnation is inappropriate but where no elaborate industry analysis is required to demonstrate the anticompetitive character 
of an inherently suspect restraint."" Gordon, 423 F.3d at 209-210 (citing Brown Univ., 5 F.3d at 669). Under the ""quick look"" 
method, ""the competitive harm is presumed and the defendant  [*30] must set forth some competitive justification for the 
restraints."" Id. at 210. ""[T]he quick look approach may be applied only when an observer with even a rudimentary understanding 
of economics could conclude that the arrangement in question would have an anticompetitive effect on customers and markets."" 
Id. "
1279,1," The facts of this case are fully set forth in this Court's Memorandum Opinion entered on August 29, 2008 [Docket No. 59]. 
Familiarity with such facts and terms defined therein is assumed."
1279,2," Parties sought transfer because this Court was already ""presiding over a pending case, Avaya Inc. v. Telecom Labs, Inc., 06-
cv-2490 (GEB), that involves claims against Avaya that arise out of the same set of facts and events. Among other things, the 
Telecom Labs case involves Counterclaims, including those under the federal antitrust laws, that are nearly identical to the 
Complaint in the Black Box case."" (Letter from Robert T. Egan, Jan. 9, 2008, Docket No. 6 at 1.) "
1280,3," In its motion to dismiss, Avaya contended that the antitrust claims at issue in this case ""are virtually identical to antitrust 
counterclaims asserted by Telecom Labs, Inc. and Continuant Technologies, Inc. in Avaya Inc. v. Telecom Labs, Inc., No. 3:06-
cv-2490 (the 'TLI case')."" (Avaya's Br. in Support of Motion to Dismiss at 2.) Thus, Avaya contended that the claims ""should be 
dismissed [for] much the same . . . reasons Avaya explained"" in its brief in the TLI case. (Id.) The Court agreed that the claims in 
the instant case were virtually identical to counterclaims asserted in the TLI case. Therefore, the Court disposed of the claims in 
a similar manner. "
1282,4, Avaya does not dispute this. (Avaya's Opp. at 1 n. 1 [Docket No. 40].) 
1285,5," ""[A] third standard that falls somewhere between the rule of reason and per se standards"" is the ""quick look"" rule of reason. 
Rossi v. Standard Roofing, Inc., 156 F.3d 452, 461 n.6 (3d Cir. 1998).  [*24] This method ""applies in cases where per se 
condemnation is inappropriate but where no elaborate industry analysis is required to demonstrate the anticompetitive character 
of an inherently suspect restraint."" Gordon, 423 F.3d at 209-210 (citing Brown Univ., 5 F.3d at 669). Under the ""quick look"" 
method, ""the competitive harm is presumed and the defendant must set forth some competitive justification for the restraints."" Id. 
at 210. ""[T]he quick look approach may be applied only when an observer with even a rudimentary understanding of economics 
could conclude that the arrangement in question would have an anticompetitive effect on customers and markets."" Id. "
1297,1," Defendants also ask for summary judgment on plaintiffs' 49 U.S.C. § 14704(b) claim in count two of their complaint. Section 
14704(b) provides that a carrier ""is liable . . . for amounts charged that exceed the applicable rate for transportation or service 
contained in a tariff in effect under section 13702."" Defendants brief argument on this matter primarily rests on their contention 
that plaintiffs' case is really a rate reasonableness dispute that should be brought before the Surface Transportation Board 
(STB). As the court also notes below, it does not construe plaintiffs' claims as involving rate reasonableness; thus, they are 
properly before the court, not the STB. "
1299,2," Alternately, defendants could have inflated the mileage by including over a billion extra miles of Second and Third Proviso 
moves. (See AMSA 12145.) "
1300,3," The parties apparently do not dispute that defendants had an approved collective ratemaking agreement, originally approved 
by the ICC and subsequently re-approved by the STB. In 2007, the STB decided to terminate the approval of all motor carrier 
agreements, including defendants' agreement. "
1301,4," This makes sense given the difference between ""rates"" and ""rate adjustments."" A ""rate"" increase would be understood to 
increase a carrier's overall rate of return. Thus, an increase in rates could lead the shippers and the STB to investigate further to 
ensure the rate is reasonable. A ""rate adjustment"" on the other hand is understood to account for an increase in a specific carrier 
operating cost. If the carriers are properly using  [*24] rate adjustments to recoup increased costs, and not to disguise increases 
in overall rates of return, no one would have any need to look past the adjustment because it is a profitneutral mechanism. "
1303,5," The HGCBC was an autonomous committee of AMSA. Mr. Harrison served as President of AMSA and as Secretary of the 
HGCBC. "
1304,6," After briefing for these motions had ended, defendants  [*34] filed a supplemental authority brief bringing to the court's attention 
the recent case of Pacific Bell Telephone Co. v. linkLine Communications, Inc., 555 U.S. 438, 129 S. Ct. 1109, 172 L. Ed. 2d 
836 (2009). The issue in linkLine was whether a regulated entity that has no duty to deal with competitors under antitrust laws 
can be charged with an unlawful ""price squeeze"" claim under Section 2 of the Sherman Act. The Court held that the plaintiffs 
had no Section 2 claim, in part, because granting the requested relief would have forced courts to monitor pricing conduct 
already regulated by the FCC. Id. at 1120-21. Thus, defendants cite linkLine for the proposition that ""district courts should be 
wary about applying the antitrust law to conduct that is regulated by an agency authorized by Congress to regulate the industry, 
especially where applying the antitrust law would require the court to monitor pricing issues that are better left to the regulatory 
process."" Def. Supp. Br. 2. Plaintiffs do not necessarily disagree with this propostion, but they posit that it is little more than a platitude. The court agrees 
and finds that linkLine in no way affects this case. There is no chance of conflict between this court's potential  [*35] decision 
and any agency decision because, unlike linkLine, this case involves a horizontal price fixing claim under Section 1 of the 
Sherman Act, conduct that, if proven, is illegal per se. United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. 150, 218, 60 S. Ct. 
811, 84 L. Ed. 1129 (1940). Defendants' citation to linkLine dovetails with their earlier argument that plaintiffs' claims amount to 
nothing more than a rate reasonableness challenge properly brought before the STB. The court disagrees. Whether defendants' 
fuel surcharge is based on industry average carrier costs and therefore eligible for antitrust immunity under section 
13703(a)(1)(G) is unrelated to the reasonableness of defendants' rates. "
1314,1," Unless otherwise stated, the facts are taken from the Complaint. "
1315,2," The Springerville-Luna 345 kV transmission line is a transmission line approximately 225 miles long that terminates on the 
northern end at TEP's Springerville Switchyard north of Springerville, Arizona, and on the southern end at the Luna Substation, 
north of Deming, New Mexico. The Luna via Hidalgo to Greenlee 345 kV transmission line is comprised of two distinct segments, 
one of which terminates at TEP's Greenlee substation in eastern Arizona and at the Hidalgo Substation, which is near 
Lordsberg, New Mexico, and the other of which terminates at the Hidalgo and Luna Substations. "
1317,3, This Order is attached to the Court's copy of the Motion as Exhibit 1.
1317,4, This order is attached to the Complaint as Exhibit 3. EPE's Application for Rehearing is pending in the FERC proceedings. 
1318,5," The Court's copy of the Motion includes EPE's seven exhibits. However, the Motion docketed in the Court's electronic filing 
system does not include the exhibits. Counsel for EPE will be directed to file the Motion's exhibits."
1318,6," ""The filed-rate doctrine[] [is] also known as the 'filed-tariff doctrine,'"" and the two terms are synonymous. Evanns v. AT&T 
Corp., 229 F.3d 837, 840 (9th Cir. 2000). "
1319,7, TEP asserts that FERC's November 2008 order revised its earlier interpretation of the 1982 Agreement. 
1320,8," Indeed, FERC's April 24, 2006, Order merely ""accepted"" the OATTs. See Motion, Ex. 1, PP 5 and 45. Further, the Order 
recognized that the OATT was not a permanent transmission agreement. Id. at P 45. "
1321,9," The Court notes that TEP asserts that, even if the Court finds that the state-law claims are preempted, this Court can still hear 
this case because district courts have exclusive jurisdiction over the enforcement of ""rules, regulations, and orders"" of FERC 
under the Act. 16 U.S.C. § 825p. TEP argues that several courts have found that claims to enforce filed tariffs or filed rate 
contracts fall within this section, on the theory that a filed rate is similar to a FERC order. See e.g., Dynegy, 375 F.3d at 842-43. 
Indeed, ""[t]he District Courts of the United States . . . shall have exclusive jurisdiction of violations of this chapter or  [*27] the 
rules, regulations, and orders thereunder, and of all suits in equita and actions at law brought to enforce any liability or duty 
created by, or to enjoin any violation of this chapter or any rule, regulation, or order thereunder."" 16 U.S.C. § 825p; see also 
Dynegy, 375 F.3d at 843 (""jurisdiction lies [in the district courts] over a claim to enforce obligations that squarely fall within the 
exclusive jurisdiction provision [of 16 U.S.C. § 825p]""). "
1328,1," While Consumerinfo in its Motion extensively analyzes the first sham situation to argue that it does not apply, One 
Technologies in its Opposition agrees that the first sham situation does not apply. See Mot. at 11:12-18:28; Opp. at 10:5-6. "
1334,1," While Consumerinfo in its Motion extensively analyzes the first sham situation to argue that it does not apply, One

1346,1," STA admits this statement, but clarifies that this ""statement refers to track rules that are in effect for a single, one year racing 
season. By contrast, the present litigation involves exclusive contracts . . ., which involve major sanctioning companies, 
encompass thousands of races, and last for periods of up to five to seven years. . . ."" Pl's Responsive Concise Stmt of Mat. 
Facts, at P 30 (Sealed Document No. 230). "
1347,2," Currently, the competitors in the dirt oval track race tire market are Hoosier, Goodyear, and STA. In the late 1980s and 1990s 
there were at least five tire manufacturers competing in the dirt oval track market: Hoosier, Firestone, Goodyear, M&H, and STA 
(then called McCreary)."
1347,3," Plaintiffs state that it ""was the default sole supplier to IMCA because RTA was the only company that made the G-60 tire."" Pl's 
Responsive Concise Stmt of Mat Facts, at P 57 (Sealed Document No. 230). "
1348,4," Unlike a regular weekly race at a particular track, a ""touring race"" will travel to different tracks around the country. Touring 
races attract ""local"" or non-touring drivers to participate in the race, as well as the core group of ""touring series"" drivers. These 
touring series draw racing fans by showcasing well-known drivers and promoting rivalry between these well-known drivers and 
challengers. Third Amended Complaint, P 39. "
1349,5," According to STA, the ""right rear"" tire position is important because dirt oval track races are run counter-clockwise, and the 
right rear tire is the tire that takes the most wear and, thus, requires, the most frequent replacement. The right rear tire is 
typically the most expensive tire. Third Amended Complaint, at P 58."
1349,6," In addition, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has recognized a third standard that falls somewhere 
between the rule of reason analysis and a per se rule. Rossi, 156 F.3d at 461. The court of appeals refers to this middle ground 
as an abbreviated or ""quick look"" rule of reason analysis. Id. (citing Orson, Inc. v. Miramax Film Corp., 79 F.3d 1358, 1367 n.9 
(3d Cir. 1996); United States v. Brown Univ., 5 F.3d 658, 669 (3d Cir. 1993)). This ""quick look"" analysis ""applies where per se "
1350,," condemnation is not appropriate, but where a full-blown industry analysis is not required to demonstrate the anticompetitive 
character of an inherently suspect restraint."" Id. "
1354,7," While Plaintiffs disagree that  [**45] the single tire rules ensure equal access to a uniform product, lead to increased safety and 
lower the costs of tires, Plaintiffs cannot deny that various representatives of the sanctioning bodies testified that single tire rules 
resulted in these results. The Court finds that there is not sufficient disagreement to require submission of the evidence to a jury.

1370,6," The Second Circuit has stated that the district court does not abuse its discretion, as long as there is good cause, when they 
deny leave to amend pleadings on the basis of futility, bad faith, undue delay or undue prejudice. Rosner v. Star Gas Partners, 
L.P., 344 Fed. Appx. 642, 2009 WL 2581565, at *2 (2d Cir. 2009); Jin v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 310 F.3d 84, 101-02 (2d Cir. 2002) 
(denying leave to amend when motion was initiated four years after original complaint and when more than three years had 
passed since the close of discovery); see also Salahuddin v. Cuomo, 861 F.2d 40, 42 (2d Cir. 1988)."
1370,7," Rule 12(f) reads in part that ""[u]pon a motion made by a party . . . the court may order stricken from any pleading any 
insufficient defense or any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter."" "
1371,8," The Supreme Court made explicitly clear that this standard is applicable to ""all civil actions."" Ashcroft v. Iqbal,   556U.S.662  , 
129 S.Ct. 1937, 1953, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (citing Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555-56, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. 
Ed. 2d 929 (2007)). "
1373,9," Technically, at the time that the Chapter 11 Petition was filed, this case was dismissed. Therefore, the Court questions whether 
a dismissed civil case would constitute a bankruptcy asset under these circumstances. It seems doubtful that it would have been 
proper for a petitioner to list a dismissed case as an assets simply because an appeal was pending."
1373,10, 11 U.S.C. § 554(c) states that 
1374,," [u]nless the court orders otherwise, any property scheduled under section 521(1) of this title not otherwise administered at 
the time of the closing of a case is abandoned to the debtor and administered for purposes of section 350 of this title. "
1375,11," Ms. Dorsett-Felicelli represents that she is the personal guarantor on lines of credit and a mortgage that total approximately 
$850,000.00. Dkt. No. 51-3, Melissa Dorsett-Fellicelli Aff., undated, at ¶ 3. "
1376,12," The facts in these cases are clearly distinguishable from the facts in our case. Walcutt v. Clevite Corp, 13 N.Y.2d 48, 191 
N.E.2d 894, 241 N.Y.S.2d 834 (1963) involved a transaction in which Clevite Corporation contracted to sell assets previously 
acquired from the plaintiffs to defendant Richmond. Richmond formed Walco Electronics Company to assume the purchase 
obligation and he personally guaranteed Walco's obligations, including the obligation to make certain payments due to the 
plaintiffs. Richmond, in his defense, raised that Clevite defrauded him and Walco by understating the inventory. In this respect, 
finding that Richmond and Walco were one in the same, the New York Court of Appeals stated that ""[w]hen the principal's 
defense is asserted against the creditor under these same conditions, it is perfectly proper[.]"" Id. at p. 57. Accordingly, the New 
York Court of Appeals ""determined that a guarantor may always raise failure of consideration as a defense by showing that the 
creditor totally or partially failed to perform his obligation to the principal."" Midwest Corp. v. Global Cable, Inc., 688 F. Supp. 872, 
875 (S.D.N.Y. 1988) (citing Walcutt, 13 N.Y.2d at 56). Similarly, in a very complex real estate transaction, the individual defendants in Bloor v. Shapiro, 32 B.R. 993 (S.D.N.Y. 1983), 
personally guaranteed corporate debts related to and throughout a real estate transaction. These individuals, the Shapiros, were 
sued in New York on several common law theories. Since the corporate defendant was a New Jersey corporation, New York did 
not have jurisdiction over it, only the individual guarantors. The Shapiros, in return, alleged three set-off claims for breaches of 
contract and one set-off tort claim. That court found that the Shapiros, as guarantors, could assert claims based on the 
underlying contracts inasmuch as guarantors, especially ones that are the sole shareholders, may assert claims of the principal, 
with the principal's implied consent, when it is being done to protect the rights of the principal. "
1377,13," Even if Ms. Dorsett-Felicelli had the independent right to sue, her belated claim would fail because this common law tort is not 
a continuing tort and the three-year statute of limitation would bar her recovery. Andrew Greenberg, Inc. v. Svane, Inc., 36 
A.D.3d at 1099. Here, this action accrued in February 2004 and the applicable time duration to file such a cause of action would 
have expired in February 2007. To the extent that Relation Back Doctrine, pursuant to Rule 15(c)(1)(C), is raised, the Court 
submits that the Doctrine would not be a safety value because all of the elements for the Doctrine have not been met. "
1378,14," There is yet another argument raised by North Country Kids Defendants that conceptually should not be addressed by this 
Court, at this juncture, and should await future motions. North Country raises that there must be a breach of the contract in order 
to state a cause of action sounding in tortious interference with a contract. See supra pp. 26-27. In this respect, since Plaintiff 
Corporations' Agreement with Clinton County have been renewed annually, they remain in effect. Because of this fact, North 
Country Kids Defendants contend that there is no breach of the contract, a salient element of this common law tort; without a 
breach of contract, there is no tortious interference with a contract. Anderson v. Aset Corp., 416 F.3d 170, 171 (2d Cir. 2005) 
(citing NBT Bancorp Inc. v. Fleet/Norstar Fin. Group, Inc., 87 N.Y.2d 612, 620-21 (1996); see Carvel Corp. v. Noonan, 3 N.Y.3d 
182, 189-190, 818 N.E.2d 1100, 785 N.Y.S.2d 359 (2004) (citing NBT Bancorp, among others, noting that tortious interference 
with a contract requires a breach of contract, whereas interference with a prospective right, may not; however, interference with 
a prospective right requires a showing of greater culpable conduct on the part of the defendant). Continuing in a similar vein, North Country Kids Defendants charge that Plaintiff Corporations cannot maintain a claim for 
tortious interference with a contract because the Provider Agreement is terminable at will. The Provider Agreement states that 
""[t]he COUNTY provides thirty (30) days written notice to the PROVIDER of its intent to terminate the contract, or immediately by 
the COUNTY for cause."" Dkt. No. 58-4, Ex. B, Provider Agreement, at ¶ 21. Here, it is alleged the Provider Agreement continues 
to exist even to this day, but the size of the Plaintiff Corporations' client pool has been reduced annually. Under the 
circumstances where a contract is terminable at will, any interference would require more than mere persuasion but conduct akin 
to wrongful means - fraudulent representation, threats, violation of a duty of fidelity. Guard-Life Corp. v. S. Parker Hardware Mfg. 
Corp., 50 N.Y.2d 183, 193-94, 406 N.E.2d 445, 428 N.Y.S.2d 628 (1980); Miller v. Mt. Sinai Med. Ctr., 288 A.D.2d 72, 733 
N.Y.S.2d 26 (N.Y. App. Div. 1st Dep't 2001) (citing, inter alia, Guard-Life Corp., 50 N.Y.2d at 193, for the rule of law that a 
terminable at will contract cannot support a claim for tortious interference with an existing contract). Again, for the reasons 
previously stated, the scope of this Court's review is restricted to the amendments, this contention is preserved until raised in 
any prospective motion to dismiss. "
1380,15," The Court seriously considered Clinton County Defendants' argument that Ms. Dorsett-Felicelli does not have a First 
Amendment right implicated under these facts. Their primary concern is that Plaintiffs' Article 78 proceeding was brought only in 
the name of the Plaintiff Corporations. Dkt. No. 69-5, Ex. C, Art. 78 Dec. & Order, dated Oct. 31, 2004. Relying upon Easton v. 
Sundram, 947 F.2d 1011 (2d Cir. 1991), Clinton County Defendants argue that Ms. Dorsett-Fellicelli cannot demonstrate that her 
First Amendment rights were violated, given that the Article 78 was brought in the name of the corporation. Id. at 1015 (in 
bringing the Article 78 proceeding, the corporation ""BPRI's first amendment rights were implicated, not [individual] Easton's""). 
But Ms. Dorsett-Felicelli's First Amendment claim is more encompassing than just the Article 78 proceeding. It would be too 
difficult at this stage of the litigation to attempt to delineate when her First Amendment right first vested. At this juncture, the 
Court's paramount concern is whether her proposed claims survive Rule 12(b)(6) scrutiny, which we have decided above that it 
does. The matter of the Article 78 proceeding, like other issues, are best reserved for further dispositive discussion. Progressive 
Transp. Servs. Inc., v. County of Essex, 999 F. Supp. 701 (N.D.N.Y. 1998) (a dispositive motion). "
1384,1," Excluded from the class are all persons who obtained Cipro through the MediCal Prescription Drug Program; governmental 
entities; the Defendants, their co-conspirators, along with all of their respective parents, subsidiaries and/or affiliates; all persons 
or entities that purchased Cipro for purposes of resale; any purchaser of Cipro who paid a flat co-payment and who would have 
paid the same co-payment for a generic substitute under the terms of their health insurance coverage, and any and all judges

1411,1," Excluded from the class are all persons who obtained Cipro through the MediCal Prescription Drug Program; governmental 
entities; the Defendants, their co-conspirators, along with all of their respective parents, subsidiaries and/or affiliates; all persons 
or entities that purchased Cipro for purposes of resale; any purchaser of Cipro who paid a flat co-payment and who would have 
paid the same co-payment for a generic substitute under the terms of their health insurance coverage, and any and all judges 
and justices assigned to hear any aspect of this litigation. "
1420,*," While Gibson Dunn's Notice of Appearance was made solely for defendant Pfizer Inc., the firm has submitted its briefs on 
behalf of all of the manufacturing defendants, which are further defined herein. Given that the list of counsel for the other 
manufacturing defendants is quite lengthy, the Court declines to list all of the names herein. Instead, reference is made to docket 
no. 179, the Superseding Notice of the Manufacturers' Mot. to Dismiss, which sets forth counsel in their entirety."
1420,1, The Court notes that Plaintiff's Complaint is 163 pages and asserts 23 causes of action against 25 defendants. 
1421,2," Plaintiff filed a separate lawsuit against the United States Department of Health and Human Services and the United States 
Food and Drug Administration, alleging, inter alia, that the federal pedigree rules are unconstitutional. See RxUSA Wholesale, 
Inc. v. Dep't of Health & Human Servs., 467 F. Supp. 2d 285 (E.D.N.Y.). On January 7, 2009, this action was administratively 
closed without prejudice to reopen upon consent of all parties due to a Bill that  [**5] was introduced in Congress that may moot 
the issues in this case."
1421,3," Plaintiff filed a separate lawsuit against McKesson for damages allegedly stemming from McKesson's breach of its supply 
agreement. See RxUSA Wholesale, Inc. v. McKesson Corporation, No. 06cv4343 (E.D.N.Y.). "
1423,4," The Manufacturing Defendants are Alcon Laboratories, Inc., AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP, Boehringer Ingelheim 
Corporation (USA), Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Eisai Inc., Forest 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., GlaxoSmithKline, Inc., Kos Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Merck & Co., Inc., Novartis Pharmaceuticals 
Corporation, Organon International, Inc., Pfizer, Incorporated, Sanofi-Aventis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Schering-Plough 
Corporation, Takeda Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., and Wyeth. "
1426,5," Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., 472 U.S. 585, 105 S. Ct. 2847, 86 L. Ed. 2d 467 (1985)."
1426,6," In reversing the Circuit Court on other grounds, the Supreme Court in Trinko noted that it had never recognized the essential 
 [**25] facilities doctrine and that it ""f[ou]nd no need either to recognize it or to repudiate it here."" 540 U.S. at 411. "
1427,7," Because the Court finds that Plaintiff fails to allege the first element of a Section 1 claim, the Court need not, and does not, 
address the second element, viz. whether Plaintiff has alleged an unreasonable restraint of trade."
1427,8," In its opposition papers, Plaintiff relies heavily on the Second Circuit's decision in Twombly v. Bell Atl. Corp., 425 F.3d 99 (2d 
Cir. 2006), which has since been reversed by the Supreme Court. "
1430,9," In addition to prohibiting monopolization, Section 2 of the Sherman Act also prohibits combinations or conspiracies to 
monopolize. See 15 U.S.C. § 2."
1430,10," Count I asserts a Section 2 ""monopoly leveraging"" claim against McKesson. In its opposition papers, Plaintiff states that this 
reference to monopoly leveraging was incorrect and that Count I ""was intended to (and does) assert a Section 2 refusal to deal 
claim against McKesson as a result of its anti-competitive termination of a Supply Agreement between McKesson and [Plaintiff] 
(as distinguished from Count 2, which asserts a refusal to deal claim against Defendant McKesson independent of the 
termination of the Supply Agreement)."" (Pl.'s Mem. of Law in Opp'n to Wholesaler Defs.' Rule 12(b) Motion to Dismiss at 17.) "
1431,11," The Court need not, and does not, address the second element of a Section 2 claim."
1431,12," The Section 2 claims are entitled ""Monopolization of the Relevant Geographic Pharmaceutical Product Market"" and make no 
reference to a conspiracy to monopolize.  [**43] (See, e.g., Compl. at 81, 83.) "
1432,13," In support of its shared monopoly theory, Plaintiff relies on the Supreme Court's decision in Am. Tobacco Co. v. United States, 
328 U.S. 781, 66 S. Ct. 1125, 90 L. Ed. 1575 (1946), where the  [**44] Court affirmed the conviction of three major tobacco 
companies for a Section 2 conspiracy. The Court limited its review to the narrow question of whether the exclusion of 
competitors is a necessary element of monopolization under Section 2. Id. at 784. Although the Court did not directly address 
the feasibility of the shared monopoly theory, it arguably implicitly recognized such theory by affirming the convictions. Thus, the 
Am. Tobacco case ""has given some courts pause about categorically rejecting the shared monopoly theory in the context of a 
conspiracy to monopolize claim."" Arista Records LLC v. Lime Group LLC, 532 F. Supp. 2d 556, 580 (S.D.N.Y. 2007). 
Nonetheless, Plaintiff has pointed to no case where such a theory was in fact upheld. "
1433,14," Because the Court finds that Plaintiff failed to allege the first element of a Section 1 claim, the Court need not, and does not, 
address the second element, viz. whether Plaintiff has alleged  [**48] an unreasonable restraint of trade. "
1434,15," To the extent Plaintiff attempts to assert an unpleaded theory of conspiracy between the Manufacturing Defendants and the 
PWDs, that claim has already been rejected by the Court. See supra at pages    . "
1435,16, See supra at pages -- discussing viability of a shared monopoly theory. 
1439,17," HN26[
] The Second Circuit has explained that the term ""proximate causation"" when used in the RICO context ""takes on a 
meaning that is different from its ordinary meaning at common law."" Lerner v. Fleet Bank, N.A., 459 F.3d 273, 284 (2d Cir. 
2006). ""When a plaintiff brings suit under RICO . . . he or she must show both that he [or she] is within the class the statute 
sought to protect and that the harm done was one that the statute was meant to prevent."" Id. (citations and internal quotation 
marks omitted)."
1439,18," The defendants in Holmes were alleged to have participated in a conspiracy to manipulate the value of the stock of several 
companies. See Holmes, 503 U.S. at 262. When the fraud was disclosed, two broker-dealers who dealt in large amounts of the 
manipulated stock were put into liquidation when the share prices plummeted and were thus unable to meet their financial 
obligations to their customers. The Securities Investor Protection Corporation (""SIPC""), which was required to reimburse the "
1440,," injured broker-dealer firms' customers, alleged that the defendants' securities and wire-fraud offenses amounted to a pattern of 
racketeering activity within the meaning of RICO. Id. at 262-63. "
1442,19," The Shields decision was superseded by statute on other grounds, Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78u-
4, as recognized in In Re Paracelsus Corp. Sec. Litig., 61 F. Supp. 2d 591, 595 (S.D. Tex. 1998). "
1443,*," Retired judge of the Superior Court of Marin County, assigned by the Chief Justice pursuant to article VI, section 6 of the 
California Constitution. "
1444,1, All further section references are to title 47 of the United States Code unless otherwise indicated. 
1446,2," We shall sometimes refer to all of the foregoing allegations collectively as ""the license warehousing scheme."""
1446,3," The second amended complaint actually alleged two causes of action each for interference with prospective economic 
advantage,  [*10] fraud, unfair competition, and conversion. The primary difference between these duplicate causes of action 
was that one applied to the cancelled licenses, and the other to the challenged licenses. "
1448,4," The court also noted that the only cause of action that related the failure to pay taxes to any specific elements was the 
Cartwright Act claim, and questioned whether, even if not preempted, the failure to pay taxes is a violation of antitrust law. 
Plaintiffs' counsel was unable to provide the court with a case to support the proposition but responded: ""[I]n this case when 
there was a pattern of operating sham  [*18] entities, and that as a result of them being sham entities they were violating state 
law . . . it constitutes anticompetitive conduct."" "
1453,5," We also note that plaintiffs had specifically challenged the use of this credit in a proceeding before the FCC. Although the FCC 
adjusted the credit it also ruled that plaintiffs were not harmed in the bidding process. Irrespective of the outcome, the prior 
proceeding addressing the issue before the FCC illustrates that this type of claim falls directly in the area of market entry 
regulation. "
1454,6," The trial court also was apparently relying upon this footnote in TPS Utilicom, supra, when it sustained the demurrer to the first 
amended complaint, but granted leave to amend ""to allege facts sufficient to show that the [FCC] has finally determined that . . . 
[d]efendants wrongfully retained canceled licenses."" As we shall explain that footnote is premised upon a confusion of  [*40] the 
principles of federal preemption with the doctrine of primary jurisdiction."
1454,7," After the court sustained the demurrer to the first amended complaint, plaintiffs filed a request to stay the proceedings based 
upon the doctrine of primary jurisdiction, and attached an approximately 440-page table of ongoing proceedings before the FCC 
in which plaintiffs were challenging defendants' licenses. If the plaintiffs' claims were not preempted, this might have been an 
appropriate case in which to stay the proceedings until the FCC could render final decision on many of the issues within the 
agency's special expertise, such as: (1) whether and with respect to which licenses did defendants fail to satisfy construction and 
coverage requirements; (2) whether this failure did result in automatic termination or whether the FCC had discretion to, and 
would grant a waiver, or extend the period; and (3) whether defendants' retention of licenses  [*42] that plaintiffs contended 
should have been surrendered or cancelled actually harmed plaintiffs in the bidding process of any of the auctions in which 
plaintiffs participated. Resolution of these issues involves technical or policy considerations within the agency's field of expertise. 
Moreover, as the complaint itself recognized many of the challenged licenses were already the subject of ongoing administrative 
challenges, creating ""a substantial danger of inconsistent rulings."" (Ellis v. Tribune TV Co (2d Cir. 2006) 443 F.3d 71, 82-83.) If, however, the causes of action are preempted, there is no point in staying the matter until the FCC renders a final decision on 
these issues because the state claims are simply not cognizable in court at all. The complaint would have to be dismissed on 
preemption grounds even if the FCC had rendered final decisions on theses issues. The court, therefore, properly never reached 
the request for a stay, and instead denied it as moot, because the causes of action were preempted."
1454,8," Although the Telesaurus case is pending before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, it remains federal authority and is available 
for our consideration. "
1455,9," With respect to the ""challenged licenses"" which represented the majority of the licenses at issue, there was no allegation that 
the FCC had rendered a final decision on any issue. To the contrary, the second amended complaint alleged these licenses 
were ""subject to ongoing administrative proceedings before the FCC."" "
1456,10," The focus of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 was ""the entrenched local monopolies held by incumbent local exchange 
carriers."" (Kennedy & Purcell l50 Fed.Comm. L.J. 547, 570.) Again, those commentators opine that ""nothing in the 1996 Act 
undercuts the 'hog tight, horse high, and bull strong' federal regulatory framework  [*51] predicated upon . . . section 332(c)(3) . . 
. in fact section 601(c)(1) of the 1996 Act states that Congress did not intend to amend existing law, such as the 1993 Act. 
Congress provided: 'This Act and the amendments made by this Act shall not be construed to modify, impair, or supersede 
federal, state, or local law unless expressly so provided in such Act or amendments.'"" (Ibid., fn. omitted.) "
1457,*," Retired judge of the Superior Court of Marin County, assigned by the Chief Justice pursuant to article VI, section 6 of the 
California Constitution. "
1483,1," Section 133.14 provides that ""[a]ny payment made upon, under or pursuant to such contract or agreement to or for the benefit 
of any person may be recovered from any person who received or benefitted from such payment in an action by the party 
making any such payment or the heirs, personal representative or assigns of the party."" "
1501,1," Additionally, Colonial alleges that the CDCR, in connection with ""the latest proposed contract between the parties,"" has 
""requested a term that Colonial admit CDCR patients only to Mercy Hospital."" (See id.) The complaint does not allege what 
action, if any, Colonial has taken in response to the CDCR's request."
1501,2," The complaint does not allege whether the CDCR has taken any action in light of such ""diversion,"" or is even aware of it. "
1502,3," Colonial incorrectly asserts the Seventh Circuit, in MCM Partners, Inc. v. Andrews-Bartlett & Associates, Inc., 62 F.3d 967 (7th 
Cir. 1995), held an antitrust plaintiff had sufficiently alleged a product market defined as services provided to a ""single customer."" 
(See Pl.'s Opp. at 7:27 - 2.) In MCM Partners, the plaintiff alleged the product market was ""the market for the rental of forklifts 
and other material handling and personnel moving equipment at McCormick Place,"" a convention hall, see MCM Partners, 62 
F.3d at 975, i.e., a product market defined by products available for rent at a specified location, not a product market defined by 
products available for rent by one specified customer at that location. Indeed, as the Seventh Circuit noted, the consumers in the 
alleged product market were the ""exhibition contractors who set up, install, and disassemble the booths and other physical 
items,"" see id., not one particular exhibition contractor. "
1503,4," If a product market exists for ""inmate care"" provided in secure facilities, it is likely entities other than the CDCR would be 
consumers in such market as well, for example, entities managing federal prisons and county jails. Further, various government 
entities that civilly detain persons, such as persons held for observation under § 5150 of the California Welfare and Institutions 
Code or aliens held pending removal proceedings, would be consumers within a market for the provision of medical care in 
secure facilities."
1503,5," Defendants also argue Colonial has failed to sufficiently identify the geographic area in which competitors in the product market 
compete, and has failed to allege facts to support a finding that any harm to competition in the relevant market has occurred. 
Additionally, GEMCare argues that the complaint fails to sufficiently allege Gemcare has a monopoly in the product market. In 
light of the Court's finding as to Colonial's failure to allege a cognizable product market, the Court does not reach these 
additional arguments. "
1505,1," Various related entities of Harrah's and Ceasars are involved in this case, but to avoid confusion we refer to all Harrah's entities 
collectively as Harrah's, and to all Caesars entities collectively as Caesars. "
1506,2, The merger was not finalized until June 2005. 
1508,3," At the time of trial in October 2006, the agreement between Pauma and Foxwoods was under review by the National Indian 
Gaming Commission. The new casino was expected to open in 2009."
1508,4," The complaint also contained a cause of action against Caesars and Harrah's for violation of California's unfair competition law 
(UCL) (Bus. & Prof. Code, § 17200 et seq.), but Pauma abandoned  [*11] that claim. "
1509,5," In addition, Harrah's appealed the April 13, 2007 order, Harrah's and Caesars appealed a March 2 order pertaining to costs, 
and Pauma appealed the same orders. "
1511,6," The ""competition privilege"" protects a business from inducing a third party not to enter into a prospective contractual 
relationship with a competitor when ""'""'(a) the relationship [between the competitor and third person] concerns a matter involved 
in the competition between the actor and the competitor, and (b) the actor does not employ improper means, and (c) the actor 
does not intend thereby to create or continue an illegal restraint of competition, and (d) the actor's purpose is at least in part to 
advance his interest in his competition with the other.' . . . ."" [Citation.] In short, the competition privilege furthers free enterprise 
by protecting the right to compete fairly in the marketplace. One may compete for an advantageous economic relationship with a 
third party as long as one does not act improperly or illegally.'"" (Gemini Aluminum Corp. v. California Custom Shapes, Inc., 
supra, 95 Cal.App.4th at p. 1256.) "
1513,7," Business and Professions Code section 16720 sets forth various definitions of a ""trust"" in restraint of trade, and section 16726 
provides, ""Except as provided in this chapter, every trust is unlawful, against public policy and void."" "
1515,8," For the first time on appeal, Harrah's contends it cannot be liable for intentional interference with prospective economic 
relations because as Caesars's contemplated successor in interest it had a legitimate economic interest  [*40] in the proposed 
deal between Pauma and Caesars. We decline to reach the issue, as it would be unfair to Pauma and the trial court to permit 
Harrah's to change its theory on appeal. (Mattco Forge, Inc. v. Arthur Young & Co. (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 820, 847.) Further, the 
issue is not purely one of law, and rather involves matters for the trier of fact. (Gardner v. Superior Court (1986) 182 Cal.App.3d 
335, 340.) "
1517,9," Under the federal Indian Gaming Regulation Act  [*44] (25 U.S.C. § 2701 et seq.), Indian tribes are required to have compacts 
with the states that govern gaming operations on their reservations. (Id. at § 2710(d)(1).) "
1531,1," We will refer to the time period from June 20, 2002 until the present as the ""Class Period."" Plaintiffs define ""Staff RNs"" as ""nurses who: (1) are hourly paid Registered Nurses; (2) who provide in-patient care at acute care 
hospitals in Cook, DuPage, and Lake Counties; and (3) hold positions not requiring an APN [Advanced Practice Nursing] 
certification or other advanced degree."" (Pls.' Updated Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law P 5 n.2.)"
1531,2," In addition to the four express requirements of Rule 23(a), there are two implied requirements: first, the class must be 
sufficiently defined so that it is identifiable; and second, the named representatives must fall within the putative class. Fournigault 
v. Independence One Mortgage Corp., 234 F.R.D. 641, 644 (N.D. Ill. 2006). It appears to us that plaintiffs have satisfied these 
implied requirements, and defendants do not argue otherwise. "
1532,3," After four days of oral argument on plaintiffs' motion for class certification, the parties submitted final proposed findings of fact 
and conclusions of law. Hereinafter, we will refer to plaintiffs' submission as ""Pls.' Final Br."" and to defendants' submission as 
""Defs.' Final Br."""
1532,4," We will use the term ""base wages"" throughout this opinion to refer to base wages together with base-linked 
 [**11] compensation. "
1533,5," As to the UCH RNs, plaintiffs allege that the conspiracy artificially suppressed the starting point for each round of collective 
bargaining. "
1534,6," HN22[
] ""Section 1 of the Sherman Act proscribes 'every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations.'"" 42nd Parallel N. v. E St. Denim 
Co., 286 F.3d 401, 404 (7th Cir. 2002) (citing 15 U.S.C. § 1). HN23[
] Restraints that do not involve an agreement on prices 
are not  [**18] per se illegal and instead are subject to a ""Rule of Reason"" analysis. HN24[
] The Rule of Reason ""requires a 
plaintiff to show that the challenged restraint has adversely impacted competition in the relevant market."" Id. There does not appear to be a dispute that if plaintiffs could prove an agreement among the defendants to fix Staff RN wages, 
such an agreement would constitute a per se violation, and if plaintiffs could prove an agreement merely to share information 
about wages, the Rule of Reason analysis would apply. "
1535,7," Plaintiffs have made much of a recent Seventh Circuit decision in which the Court stated that the possibility,  [**22] or even 
near-inevitability, of a class including persons who have not been injured by a defendant's conduct does not preclude class 
certification. See Kohen v. Pacific Inv. Mgmt. Co., 571 F.3d 672, 677 (7th Cir. 2009). But defendants do not quarrel with that 
principle; rather, they maintain that plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that they have a reliable common method for 
determining injury. "
1536,8," ""Econometrics is the application of statistical techniques and inferences to observed data in order to evaluate economic 
theories and their predictions. Econometrics provides a means for determining whether a correlation, which may reflect a 
parallel, reciprocal, or causal relationship, may exist between various events that involve complex sets of facts. The principal 
value of econometrics for antitrust analysis and litigation lies in its use for developing an empirical foundation in order to prove or 
disprove assertions that are based on a particular economic  [**24] theory."" ABA Section of Antitrust Law, Econometrics: Legal, 
Practical, and Technical Issues 1 (2005)."
1536,9," The first wedge is set forth in Dr. Rausser's initial Declaration; the second wedge is set forth in his Supplementary Declaration; 
and the third and fourth wedges are set forth in his Rebuttal Declaration. The second wedge was created with the defendants' 
payroll data, which was not available to Dr. Rausser before he submitted his initial Declaration. The third and fourth wedges 
were created in response to Dr. Willig's criticisms. In pre-hearing briefs and during oral argument, defendants asserted that there 
were problems with each of Dr. Rausser's wedge analyses. During oral argument, we asked plaintiffs' counsel whether plaintiffs 
are now relying solely on the fourth wedge (""Wedge 4""), the most recent of Dr. Rausser's analyses. In the interest of judicial 
economy, we did not want to discuss three obsolete wedge models. Counsel conceded that plaintiffs would choose Wedge 4 as 
the best of the four models, and accordingly, we indicated that Wedge 4 would be the model on which we would base our class 
certification decision. (Tr. of July 15, 2009 Hrg. at 764-65.)"
1536,10," ""Non-exempt"" refers to RNs who are not in administrative or management-type positions. (Id. P 17.) ""APN certification"" refers 
to ""Advanced Practice Nurse"" certification; Dr. Rausser explains that this accreditation requires additional training and education 
and qualifies RNs for greater responsibilities in a specialized field of care. (Id. P 18.) "
1537,11," The terms ""oligopsony"" and ""monopsony"" are the reverse of oligopoly and monopoly. They refer to an abuse of market power 
on the buyer side. See Todd v. Exxon Corp., 275 F.3d 191, 201 (2d Cir. 2001)."
1537,12," The term ""wedge"" is derived from the shape that can be identified when a monopsony market is graphed. "
1539,13," ""Registry"" nurses are RNs employed by hospitals to fill in as needed. Generally, registry nurses are paid an hourly rate and do 
not receive benefits. Registry Nurses make up about 20 percent of the proposed class. (Defs.' Final Br. § 1 P 14.)"
1539,14," ""Feasible Generalized Least Squares"" is a type of regression technique. "
1541,15," ""A Monte Carlo simulation is a generally accepted statistical tool that begins with a large number of variables with a specified 
range for each variable and runs all of the various permutations or possible outcomes for those various variables."" In re 
Nanovation Techs., Inc., 364 B.R. 308, 336 (Bankr. N.D. Ill. 2007.)"
1541,16," We have provided a very brief summary of the most salient points of Dr. Willig's declarations. Dr. Willig identifies what he 
believes are several other problems that render Dr. Rausser's analyses invalid--the errors of computation and interpretation 
referred to supra--but we do not find it necessary to discuss all of them. It suffices to say that Dr. Willig's declarations are 
extremely thorough."
1541,17," Defendants maintain that ""[p[laintiffs' descriptions are backward and mix up the various regressions run by Prof. Rausser."" 
(Defs.' Final Br. § 1 P 72.) "
1542,18, Defendants' market power is relevant to plaintiffs' Rule of Reason claim in Count II. 
1543,19, This problem is not unique to Wedge 4. It is inherent in each of Dr. Rausser's wedges. 
1546,20," Plaintiffs contend that a ""full-blown"" Daubert inquiry is ""not appropriate at the class certification stage."" (Pls.' Final Br. P 57.) 
We disagree. In Mars Steel Corp. v. Continental Bank N.A., 880 F.2d 928, 938 (7th Cir. 1989), which involved a fairness hearing, 
the Seventh Circuit found that the Federal Rules of Evidence apply to proceedings under Rule 23. Furthermore, in deciding 
whether plaintiffs have demonstrated predominance, we have necessarily had to conduct a ""full-blown"" inquiry into the reliability 
of Dr. Rausser's analysis. "
1547,21," The proposed classes consisted of plaintiffs allegedly injured by the defendant's refusal to permit the transmission of caller 
identification data across its long-distance telephone network. 339 F.3d at 296. "
1558,1, The case is before the undersigned United States Magistrate Judge by written consent of the parties. See 28 U.S.C. § 636(c).

1558,8," Both parties submitted volumes of exhibits, including, but not limited to, pages of depositions, company documents, contracts, 
studies, declarations, and expert reports. Some exhibits were submitted by both parties; some were submitted more than once 
by the same party. For instance, St. Francis' exhibit 2 is the same as Bard's exhibit 128. St. Francis' exhibit 178 is the same as 
its exhibit 111. The Court will cite such duplicative exhibits by reference to only one location. The citation to one party's exhibit 
and not to the duplicative exhibit submitted by the opposing party is not to be misinterpreted as any preference for one party or "
1559,," the other. Additionally, many of the deposition pages submitted by both parties are from another case, Rochester Medical Corp. 
v. C.R. Bard, Inc., No. 5:08-CV-060 (E.D. Tex.)."
1559,9, St. Francis voluntarily dismissed a fifth count for civil conspiracy.
1559,10," There is a nationwide class and a Missouri sub-class. They are defined as follows. I. Nationwide Class All persons or entities who purchased Urological Catheters in the United States directly from Bard at any time during the 
period February 21, 2003,  [**8] through the present and whose purchases of Bard's Urological Catheters were governed 
by Bard's contracts with GPOs. Excluded from the Class are: Bard's parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, and agents; 
distributors; and federal governmental entities. II. Missouri Sub-Class All persons or entities in the State of Missouri who purchased Urological Catheters in the United States directly from Bard at 
any time during the period February 21, 2003, through the present and whose purchases of Bard's Urological Catheters 
were governed by Bard's contracts with GPOs. Excluded from the Class are: Bard's parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, and 
agents; distributors; and federal governmental entities."
1559,11," Specifically, St. Francis submitted 13 volumes with an approximate average of 500 pages per volume. Bard submitted 7 
volumes."
1559,12," See note 7, supra."
1559,13," Indeed, Bard had to lower its prices for urological products after GPOs became a force in the marketplace. (B. Ex.-2, 61 at 33.) "
1560,14," The materials manager for one hospital, Indian River Medical Center, estimated in 2006 that the Center saved three to five 
million dollars a year by belonging to a GPO. (B. Ex.-2 153 at 16.)"
1560,15, An exception is the Health Trust Purchasing Group. (B. Ex. 47 at 423.)
1560,16," Plaintiffs submitted evidence that Bard was invited to a meeting of the Novation nursing committee when the committee was 
discussing Rochester's application to have its Release NF catheter be accepted under Novation's new technology provisions. 
There is no evidence that Bard controlled the resolution of that application."
1560,17," If a supplier does not have a full line of urological products, the supplier is exempt beginning in April 2005 from Novation's 
share calculations for purchases under the various tiers and in March 2007 from Premier's calculations. (B. Ex.-2, 21 at 58.) "
1561,18," A commitment to purchase a certain amount  [**16] of a manufacturer's products may apparently be renegotiated. For 
instance, a January 2006 agreement between Broadlane, a GPO, and Tyco reduced the committed level of Broadlane's 
members from 85% to 60%. (B. Ex.-2, 133.) It also provided that the supplier would pay Broadlane's administrative fees of 3% of 
the aggregate purchase price paid during the prior calendar month by all customers for all products purchased under the 
agreement, less any credits and rebates. (Id.)"
1561,19," For instance, Bard's 2007 urological products agreement with Broadlane required at least 85% of a member's annual 
aggregate purchases, measured in terms of dollars, for the best prices. (Pl. Ex.-2, 66.) If a member was not compliant, the 
member wold be moved to an access tier and its rebates suspended. (Id. at 4.) The rebates would be later reinstated should its 
purchases subsequently satisfy the committed level. (Id.) But see note 18, supra."
1561,20," See note 3, supra. "
1562,21," The Court notes that Premier's 2002 group purchasing policy setting forth the guidelines for its Commitment Program 
expressed a preference that its members not ""independently solicit quotations from suppliers for products or services covered 
under [the Program] agreements . . . ."" (Pl. Ex.-2, 115 at [4].) It was anticipated that the highest level of commitment would be 
less than 100% ""to allow members to meet unique needs or undertake trials of newly emerging products promising advantages."" 
(Id.)"
1562,22," Bard pays a rebate off any contract, regardless of whether it is a GPO, IDN, or individual contract. (Pl. Ex.-2, 157 at 85.) "
1563,23," For instance, HPG receives a 3% administrative fee under Bard's urological products contract. (Pl. Ex.-2, 145 at 52-53.) Under 
that same contract, Bard pays a 2.5% rebate, which is allocated to the various hospitals that purchased the products. (Id. at 54.) 
Also, in response to an e-mail about formulating a proposal for a group of Novation members that had decided to form their own, 
a Bard officer noted that Bard paid fees to Novation because Novation's size and ability to move a large market share with a 
sole-source agreement relieved Bard from having to invest additional selling resources. (Pl. Ex.-2, 57.)"
1563,24," On the other hand, Premier considers a supplier's market share as an indicator of which products their members preferred to 
buy. (Pl. Ex.-2, 159 at 60.) Consequently, market share was a consideration in deciding whether to award a supplier a contract. 
(Id. at 59.)"
1563,25," The United States market is divided into acute care and extended care markets. (Pl. Ex.-2, 44.) Acute care markets include 
hospitals, surgery centers, and outpatient clinics. (Id.) Extended care markets include nursing homes, rehabilitation and long-
term care facilities, home health care agencies, and physician offices. (Id.) Acute care sales represent 37% of Bard's total units 
sold and 48% of total dollars. (Id.) "
1564,26," Thus, Bard's sales force calls on hospitals, not GPOs or distributors. (Pl. Ex.-2, 157 at 26-27.)"
1564,27," For instance, when considering whether to buy a particular product, Daniel Humphrey, Memorial Hermann Healthcare 
System's chief supply chain officer, looks at, among other things, a supplier's manufacturing capabilities, back order problems, 
product performance, patient safety, and ability to contract with the System's distributor.  [**31] (Pl. Ex.-2, 149 at 42, 44.) The 
latter is important because they use their distributor as a warehousing agent; therefore, they would house their product 
elsewhere if the supplier had no contract with their distributor. (Id. at 43-44.) "
1565,28," ""[T]o receive 510(k) clearance, a manufacturer must give the FDA 90 days' notice that the manufacturer intends to market a 
medical device (1) which is substantially equivalent to a device already approved by the FDA, and (2) which has the same 
intended use as the approved device."" Biomedical Sys. Corp. v. GE Marquette Medical Sys., Inc., 287 F.3d 707, 708 (8th Cir. 
2002) (per curiam). ""A substantially equivalent device is examined in the § 510(k) process only for similarities with existing 
devices; safety and effectiveness are not the focus."" Brooks v. Howmedica, Inc., 273 F.3d 785, 794 (8th Cir. 2001)."

1565,30," In January 2004, Tyco's estimated share of the silicone-coated catheter market was 65%; Bard's was 35%. (B. Ex.-2, at 95.) "
1566,31," For instance, Indian River will buy new technology products off-contract. (Pl. Ex.-2, 172 at 17.) A resource committee 
evaluates new products presented to it. (Id.) "
1568,32," See note 8, supra. "
1569,33," Testimony from various hospital representatives illustrates the reasoning behind catheters being considered a clinical-
preference item . Manatee Health System switched to Bard because their nursing staff rejected the Tyco products under their 
GPO contract. (B. Ex.-2, 27 P 8.) UVA began Bardex IC  [**50] after a thirteen-month study of infection control catheters. (B. 
Exs.-2, 16 at 24-25; 34 at 15-16.) On the other hand, University HealthSystem Consortium stopped using Bardex IC in 2007 afer 
there was no improvement in infection control. (Pl. Exs.-2 63, 77.) Hamot Medical Center stopped using Bardex IC because of 
some cuffing problems and stopped using Lubri Sil IC after experiencing an increase in catheter-associated UTIs. (Pl. Ex.-2, 73.) 
Henry Ford Hospital stopped using Bardex IC and changed to Tyco products after experiencing an increase in UTIs. (Pl. Ex.-2, 
38.) The role that UTIs played in deciding what catheters to purchase was known by Rochester. Rochester considered its 
""superior antibacterial technology and . . . unique drug delivery technology"" as a strength. (B. Ex.-2, 146.) The alleged superiority 
of its catheter over Bard's in fighting infections was an advantage it had over Bard. (B. Ex.-2, 201.) A Premier representative 
testified that she was concerned that Rochester's product line was ""very clinical."" (Pl. Ex.-2, 170 at 367.) "
1570,34," Dr.  [**54] Litan's reference in his report to the exit of Baxter being the ""direct result"" of Bard's GPO contracting practices, see 
Litan Report at 33, ignores this testimony and testimony that another problem with Baxter was its manufacturing location. (See 
B. Ex.-1, 9 at 83-84.) "
1572,35, Dr. Litan also errs by including Integrated Delivery Networks in the relevant market. (See Litan Rep. at 16 n.17.)
1572,36," The Court notes that ""[m]arket definition is not a jurisdictional prerequisite, or an issue having  [**64] its own significance under 
the statute; it is merely an aid for determining whether power exists."" General Indus., 810 F.2d at 805 (alteration in original). "
1573,37, It is undisputed that there are two relevant geographic markets: the United States and Missouri. 
1574,38," One estimate is that there are approximately 5,000 acute care inpatient hospitals and 4500 practicing urologists. (Pl. Ex.-2, 
171 at 9.)"
1574,39," Those rebates may also be considerable. For instance, by buying on its Novation's contract, Memorial Hermann Healthcare 
System  [**73] realized approximately $ 6 million in rebates annually."
1574,40," As noted above, Rochester was the plaintiff in an antitrust action against Bard, Tyco, Novation, and Premier. "
1575,41," Another allegation that Bard maintained monopoly power through disparagement of competitors' products was earlier 
dismissed by the Court. "
1576,42," The questionable significance of FDA approval is illustrated  [**80] by Tyco's sales of Dover Silver. The catheter was used by 
one hospital and found to reduce hospital-associated urinary tract infections by 69%. (B. Ex.-2, 192 at 59.) The hospital then 
decided to use that catheter. (Id. at 59-60.) Its decision was not affected by what claims the FDA permitted Tyco to use in its 
advertising. (Id. At 61.) "
1577,43," Indeed, Rochester was ranked 51st in July 2007 as one of the fastest growing small public companies in the country. (B. Ex.-
2, 183.)"
1577,44," ""Variable costs"" are ""those costs that vary with output[.]"" Morgan, 892 F.2d at 1360 n.11 (alteration added). "
1578,45," To the contrary, St. Francis participated in a Novation program because of the economic savings resulting from larger 
 [**87] rebates. (B. Ex.-2, 33 at 47.)"
1578,46," The importance of clinical preference in St. Francis' purchasing decisions is reflected in the decision to continue with Bardex 
IC and not change to Lubri Sil I.C., claimed by Bard to cut the rate of urinary tract  [**88] infections by 44%. (B. Ex.-2, 60.) After 
conducting a trial of the Lubri Sil I.C., the clinical support team elected to stay with Bardex IC. (Id.) "
1579,47," The Clayton Act does not apply to services. See Marts, 77 F.3d at 1113 n. 7. In support of Count III, Plaintiffs rely on the allegations of anticompetitive conduct and of lack  [**89] of business justification 
presented in support of the previous two counts and found to be meritless for the reasons set forth above."
1579,48," The direct purchaser rule does not apply to requests for injunctive relief under § 16 of Clayton Act. Campos, 140 F.3d at 1171. "
1580,, 
1586,1," The parties agree that federal antitrust law principles control both Dr. Bevan's federal and state antitrust claims. The Colorado 
Supreme Court, whose judgment naturally is final on matters of state law, has held that, ""[g]iven the substantial similarity in text 
and purpose present in the federal and state antitrust statutes, . . . federal decisions construing the Sherman and Clayton Acts, 
although not necessarily controlling on our interpretation of the Colorado law, are nevertheless entitled to careful scrutiny in 
determining the scope of the state antitrust statute."" People v. N. Ave. Furniture & Appliance, Inc., 645 P.2d 1291, 1295-96 
(Colo. 1982). The Colorado General Assembly similarly noted in its passage of the Colorado Antitrust Act that ""the courts 
[should] use as a guide interpretations given by the federal  [**9] courts to comparable federal antitrust laws."" C.R.S. § 6-4-119. 
Consistent with these directions, we have in the past applied HN1[
] federal antitrust analysis to Colorado antitrust claims. See, 
e.g., Full Draw Prods. v. Easton Sports, Inc., 182 F.3d 745, 757 (10th Cir. 1999). Absent contrary direction from any state 
authority, we see no reason to deviate from this practice here and so proceed to analyze Dr. Bevan's federal and state 
monopolization and attempted monopolization claims collectively and with attention to federal precedents. "
1588,2," It's not entirely clear that Dr. Bevan has even alleged the existence of two separate markets, as his purported ""monopoly 
leveraging"" claim requires. At times, Dr. Bevan has suggested that there are two product markets here--one for ""inpatient 
nephrology physician services"" and another for ""outpatient nephrology physician services."" See Opening Br. at 12. At other 
times, he has intimated we have just one market before us--one for ""nephrology physician services."" See Second Am. Compl., 
J.A. at 47. None of this confusion, however, affects our analysis, because our anticompetitive conduct and antitrust injury 
holdings do not rely for their validity on the presence of one market versus two. Though the parties avidly dispute the appropriate 
scope of the relevant geographic market--should it be limited to the ""Durango area"" or more properly encompass the ""Four 
Corners area""?--deciding that question is likewise inessential to our analysis. "
1590,3," As it happened, after the Supreme Court's decision, Highlands Corp. continued to lose money and eventually merged with Ski 
Co., though presumably for a higher price than it would have commanded before the Court's intervention, leading some 
commentators to argue that Aspen Skiing ""amounted to no more than a sharing of the monopoly between the parties."" Glen O. 
Robinson, On Refusing to Deal with Rivals, 87 Cornell L. Rev. 1177, 1196 n.74 (2002). "
1591,4," Because we affirm the district court's summary judgment for Mercy, we have no need to address Dr. Bevan's separate 
arguments challenging the propriety of the district court's intra-district transfer of the case from Denver to Durango in the event of 
a trial. "
1599,1," The Court declined to allow the Plaintiffs to amend their complaint for a fourth and fifth time to add Civil RICO claims among 
other amendments. (See Docket Entry # 391 at 9-10). "
1600,2," The Brandriffs claim that the Defendants' acts injured them in the following ways. With respect to the passage of Amendment 
Three, the Brandriffs assert that it injured them by lowering their property values relative to communities that do not have a 
similar requirement. Similarly, they claim that raising the initial capital contribution fee from $4,000 to $15,000 furthered lowered 
their property values. Finally, with respect to the Greenspace Fee, they claim injury based both on the fact that they have to pay 
the fee as well as enduring any additional values caused its existence. The Davenports challenge the same actions, but have different theories of injury. With respect to the initial imposition of 
Amendment Three, the Davenports do not bring a claim based on loss of property values. Rather, they seek reimbursement of 
the dues and assessments that they have paid to DIC because of their required membership. With respect to the increase in the 
initial capital contribution, their claim is similar to the Brandriffs' — that raising the contribution fee lowered their property values. "
1601,," Like the Brandriffs, they challenge the Greenspace Fee both because they pay the fee and because they claim it lowers their 
property values. "
1602,3," In evaluating damages in this case, the Plaintiffs' own expert, Dr. Desvousges, examined property values on at least four other 
similar island communities located fairly close to Dataw Island: Cat Island, Fripp Island, St. James Plantation, and Callawassie 
Island. (""Property Damages Associated with Dataw Island Tying Arrangement,"" Final Expert Report of William H. Desvousges, 
Ph.D., Dec. 1, 2008, 1, attached to Pls.' Mem. in Opp'n to Dataw Island Club's and Individual DIC Defs.' Mot. for Summ. J., 
Docket Entry # 272 as Ex. A). Dr. Desvousges explains that he considered Cat Island, Fripp Island, and St. James Plantation 
because they are ""located nearby and support a similar golf course style community."" (Id. 4). Callawassie Island is also located 
near Dataw and offers ""similar facilities."" (Id.). The Defendants' expert contends that the relevant market is actually much larger; 
however, he notes that even if one limited the market to the four islands discussed by the Plaintiffs' expert, Dataw Island 
property would comprise ""only about 17 percent"" of the Plaintiffs' sample. (Report of Robert E. McCormick, Ph.D. 6). 
Additionally, the Defendants point to a 2005 consultant's study commissioned by the Dataw Island Club that shows ""that almost 
40 percent of all Dataw Island Club members moved from northeastern states (NY, PA, NJ, MA, & CT)."" (Id. 7) (emphasis in 
original). The same study reports that only eight percent of Dataw Island residents moved to the island from another location in 
South Carolina. (Id. 9). Given that the vast majority of Dataw Island residents moved from out of state, and many of them from a 
significant distance, it seems highly unlikely that those in the market for comparable real estate communities would consider only 
Dataw Island. Indeed, as noted by the Plaintiffs' expert, Dataw Island marketing materials state that ""potential buyers 'look at 
competing communities in the Beaufort areas as well as several states away.'"" (Final Expert Report of William H. Desvousges, 
Ph.D. 3). "
1605,4," Plaintiffs appear to have abandoned this claim in proposed amendments to their Complaint, and the parties provide little 
discussion on this issue in their memoranda in support or in opposition to summary judgment. However, as the Verified Second 
Amended Complaint remains the operative Complaint in this case, the Court will address the Plaintiffs' unlawful exclusive 
dealing claims in this Order. "
1608,1," This order will refer to the Defendants in three groups, except where otherwise provided. The first group will be collectively 
referred to as ""Countrywide"": Countrywide Financial Corporation (""CFC""); Countrywide Bank, FSB (""CW Bank""); Countrywide 
Home Loans, Inc. (""CHL""); Countrywide KB Home Loans, LLC; and Countrywide Tax Services Corporation (""CTS""). The second 
group will be collectively referred to as ""LandSafe"": LandSafe, Inc.; LandSafe Appraisal Services, Inc.; LandSafe Credits, Inc.; 
and LandSafe Flood Determination, Inc. Bank of America Corporation (""BoA"") stands alone in the third group."
1608,2, Hereinafter this order cites paragraphs of the First Amended Complaint with bare ¶ numbers. 
1611,3," The Defendants contend that the Defendants CFC, LandSafe, and LandSafe Appraisal must be dismissed because the 
Complaint does not identify any specific conduct of those Defendants. See Defs.' Mot. (Dkt. # 17) at 4-5. While that may be true, 
at this stage of the proceeding the court will grant Plaintiffs' leave to amend the Complaint to add allegations related to those 
Defendants and to cure other deficiencies, as explained infra Part E. "
1612,4," The court does not agree with Plaintiffs that the ""Countrywide Broker Enterprise"" is ""nearly identical"" to the enterprise found 
sufficient in In re Countrywide MDL, because the Broker Enterprise in that case identified at least two specific brokerages in 
addition to other unnamed brokers. See In re Countrywide Fin. Corp. Mortgage Mktg. and Sales Practices Litig., 601 F. Supp. 2d 
1201, 2009 WL 458780 (S.D. Cal. Feb. 9, 2009). Here, all of the mortgage brokers are unnamed, and the Complaint does not 
identify any specific transaction with any particular broker. "
1613,5," The Defendants have reserved their right to challenge the application of California law to this claim. See Defs.' Mot. (Dkt. # 17) 
at 20 n.7. "
1616,1," The plaintiffs are the cities of Moundridge, Kansas; Winfield, Kansas; Coffeyville, Kansas; Denison, Kansas; Garnett, Kansas; 
Greensburg, Kansas; Halstead, Kansas; Humboldt, Kansas; Iola, Kansas; La Cygne, Kansas; Macon, Missouri; Minneapolis, 
Kansas; Osage City, Kansas; Chanute, Kansas; Kechi, Kansas; Larned,  [*3] Kansas; Lyons, Kansas; Spearville, Kansas; 
Rensselaer, Indiana; Sabinal, Texas; Shelbina, Missouri; and Wellington, Kansas; and the village of Stonington, Illinois."
1616,2," Shell moves separately for summary judgment and also joins in Exxon Mobil, BP America, and ConocoPhillips' motion for 
summary judgment."
1616,3," Because the plaintiffs have not shown that a genuine issue of material fact exists regarding whether a conspiracy existed, the 
defendants' arguments that the plaintiffs have not suffered any antitrust injury, lack standing to sue for damages, and have 
incorrectly calculated damages will not be addressed."
1616,4," ""An opposition to … a motion [for summary judgment] shall be accompanied by a separate concise statement of genuine 
issues setting forth all material facts as to which it is contended there exists a genuine issue necessary to be litigated, which 
shall include references to the parts of the record relied on to support the statement."" Local Civil Rule 7(h). ""[T]he court may 
assume that facts identified by the moving party in its statement of material  [*5] facts are admitted, unless such a fact is 
controverted in the statement of genuine issues filed in opposition to the motion."" Id. A nonmovant's statement of genuine issues 
is intended to ""isolate [] the facts that the parties assert are material, distinguish[] disputed from undisputed facts, and identif[y] 
the pertinent parts of the record."" Jackson v. Finnegan, Henderson, Farabow, Garrett & Dunner, 101 F.3d 145, 151, 322 U.S. 
App. D.C. 35 (D.C. Cir. 1996). The plaintiffs filed a counter-statement of the case, but this statement did not identify material 
facts as to which there is a genuine issue necessary to be litigated, it incorporated legal arguments, and it often asserted facts 
with no citations to the record. See id. at 153 (stating that the plaintiff's ""relevant facts"" section of his opposition brief did not 
comply with the local rule's requirements in part because it blended factual assertions with legal argument); Synergistic Tech., 
Inc. v. IDB Mobile Commc'ns, Inc., 871 F. Supp. 24, 28 n.4 (D.D.C. 1994) (noting that the plaintiff did not comply with the local 
rule because it did not identify how the facts were disputed and frequently failed to cite to the record). Thus, the defendants' 
statement  [*6] of material facts, where supported by the record and not properly rebutted will be treated as admitted. "
1618,5," The defendants also move to exclude Dr. John Wilson's May 6, 2008 expert report under Federal Rule of Evidence 702, 
arguing that because his conclusions are unsupported, unreliable, and incorrect, the evidence is inadmissible. Even if Dr. 
Wilson's expert conclusions were admissible, the plaintiffs have not shown sufficient evidence of a triable dispute to survive 
summary judgment. Therefore, the defendants' motion to exclude Dr. Wilson's May 6, 2008 report will be denied as moot. The defendants also moved to exclude Dr. Wilson's June 20, 2008 first supplemental expert report as untimely. Because the 
plaintiffs did not oppose this motion, the defendants' motion to exclude Dr. Wilson's June 20, 2008 first supplemental expert 
report is deemed conceded. See Peter B. v. CIA, 620 F. Supp. 2d 58, 70 (D.D.C. 2009). "
1620,6, Plaintiffs did not seek any discovery from Shell.
1620,7," For example, the defendants point to evidence showing that in March 2005, La Cygne paid $ 2.49 per MMBtu while Halstead 
paid $ 7.33 per MMBtu. (Defs.' Stmt. P 69.) "
1622,8," The plaintiffs do not cite to specific evidence that would support a demonstration of a motivation by the defendants to enter into 
a conspiracy. However, there is evidence that not all of the defendants had similar business strategies and interacted in different 
areas of the natural gas market, which may weaken any motive to conspire. For example, Exxon Mobil was not a reseller of 
natural gas while Shell was an active buyer of natural gas from other producers and markets for resale. (Defs.' Mem., Ex. 99 at 
2, Ex. 88 at 54.) Dr. Kalt notes that collusion is ""hampered when would-be participants . . . have different objectives and face 
different constraints -- i.e., when they do not see the costs and benefits of collusion through the same lens."" (Defs.' Mem., Ex. 88 
at 54.) Differences among the defendants' business strategies could suggest a lack of motive to conspire. "
1623,9," The volatility summary is a single page within Exhibit 9 to the plaintiffs' opposition memorandum. Another document relating to 
the NPC Supply Task Group within this exhibit reflects a date of December 18, 2002. (Pls.' Opp'n, Ex. 9 at 2.) It is unclear 
whether the volatility analysis was part of this December 18, 2002 document. "
1625,10," Given the conclusory and unsupported nature of Dr. Wilson's findings, it is unclear whether these conclusions would be 
admissible as expert testimony under Federal Rule of Evidence 702. A court must evaluate an expert witness' proffered opinions 
to ensure that the expert testimony (1) qualifies as scientific,  [*41] technical or other specialized knowledge and (2) will assist 
the trier of fact to understand the evidence or resolve a disputed factual issue. Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharms., 509 U.S. 579, 
589-91, 113 S. Ct. 2786, 125 L. Ed. 2d 469 (1993). ""Expert testimony that rests solely on 'subjective belief or unsupported 
speculation' is not reliable."" Groobert v. President and Dirs. of Georgetown Coll., 219 F. Supp. 2d 1, 6 (D.D.C. 2002) (quoting 
Daubert, 509 U.S. at 590). ""[A]n expert's methodology fails the reliability requirement when there is 'an analytical gap between 
the data and the opinion proffered.'"" Id. 9-10 (quoting Gen. Elec. Co. v. Joiner, 522 U.S. 136, 146, 118 S. Ct. 512, 139 L. Ed. 2d 
508 (1997)). ""If the witness is relying solely or primarily on experience, then the witness must explain how that experience leads 
to the conclusion reached, why that experience is a sufficient basis for the opinion, and how that experience is reliably applied to 
the facts. The trial court's gatekeeping function requires more than simply 'taking the expert's word for it.'"" Twin Cities Bakery 
Workers Health & Welfare Fund v. Biovail Corp., Civil Action Nos. 01-2197, 03-2075 (JR), 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5570, 2005 WL 
3675999, at *4 (D.D.C. Mar. 31, 2005) (quoting Fed. R. Evid. 702, Advisory Committee Notes for 2000 Amendments). 
 [*42] However, even if Dr. Wilson's testimony were admissible, the plaintiffs have not shown that a genuine issue of material 
fact exists as to whether the defendants conspired. "
1628,1," ""HHI is a measure of market concentration calculated by squaring the market share of each firm in the market and then 
summing the squares. The HHI takes into account the relative size and distribution of the firms in a market. The HHI approaches 
zero when the market consists of a large number of firms of relatively equal size and reaches a maximum when a market is a 
monopoly."" United States v. Tote, Inc., 768 F. Supp. 1064, 1070 n.6 (citing U.S. Dep't of Justice Merger  [*4] Guidelines § 3.1 
(1984))."
1628,2," Plaintiff vigorously contests Defendants' assertions and claims it was Diebold who terminated discussions. The Court cannot 
resolve that dispute at this time. "
1629,3," Form 8-K is the ""current report"" companies must file with the SEC to announce major events that shareholders should know 
about. See U.S. Sec. and Exch. Comm'n, http://www.sec.gov/answers/form8k.htm (last visited Sept. 29, 2009)."
1629,4," The purchase price seems very modest. In 2008, PES generated $ 88 million in revenue."
1629,5," As to permanent injunctive relief, Plaintiff requests an order requiring ES&S to divest its interests in PES, Premier Canada, and 
DIMS and for a novation of the Acquisition. "
1630,6," At the outset, the Court should note that Plaintiff's  [*10] request for injunctive relief is predicated solely on the alleged violation 
of Section 7 of the Clayton Act. Accordingly, this opinion only addresses Plaintiff's likelihood of success on Count One."
1630,7," Title 15 U.S.C. § 26 provides, in pertinent part: Any person, firm, corporation, or association shall be entitled to sue for and have injunctive relief, in any court of the United 
States having jurisdiction over the parties, against threatened loss or damage by a violation of the antitrust laws . . . when 
and under the same conditions and principles as injunctive relief against threatened conduct that will cause loss or damage 
is granted by courts of equity. . . . "
1631,8," Plaintiff never explained what it means by a ""risk premium."""
1631,9, Plaintiff also alleges injury due to its loss of the business opportunity to purchase PES itself. 
1632,10," Antitrust law seems to have shifted towards a more lenient approach to mergers. Accordingly, while United States v. 
Philadelphia National Bank remains ""good law,"" its unclear whether 30% would be sufficient to find liability in 2009. "
1633,11," Incidentally, the Court notes that the hypothetical acquisition of PES by Hart would also result in raising a presumption that the 
merger is likely to create or enhance market power. According to Plaintiff's figures, a Hart-PES merger would result in an 
aggregate market HHI index of approximately 3419, resulting in a roughly 416 point increase from pre-Acquisition levels. As 
Plaintiff is quick to point out, however, a Hart-PES merger would be ""less anti-competitive"" than that of ES&S-PES. "
