22,1," (Answer to First Amended Complaint for Damages, hereafter, ""Answer,"" Docket Item No. 7.) "
23,2," In Anza, the plaintiff alleged the defendants ""defraud[ed] the New York tax authority and us[ed] the proceeds from the fraud to 
offer lower prices designed to attract more customers."" Id. at 457-458. The cause of the plaintiff's injury was an intervening "
24,," lawful set of actions (lowering prices) completely separate from the alleged RICO violation. Id. at 458. The Supreme Court 
concluded that proximate cause was absent in the RICO claim. Id. The Supreme Court observed that the intervening set of 
actions could have been carried out for a number of lawful reasons. Since the injury was allegedly caused by the defendants 
lowering prices, the alleged RICO violation was not the direct cause of injury to the plaintiff. Id. at 459-460."
24,3," (Plaintiff's Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Opposition to Defendant Irish Construction's Motion for Judgment on the 
Pleadings at 5-6, hereafter, ""Opposition,"" Docket Item No. 28.)"
24,4," Since the Court finds that Plaintiff lacks standing to bring a RICO claim, the Court need not address Defendant's other grounds 
for judgment on the pleadings. "
28,1," The largest OEMs, or 'Tier Ones' as they are sometimes referred to in the industry, account for roughly 80% of worldwide 
server and workstation (special high-powered desktops) sales, some 40% of desktop sales and nearly 80% of notebook sales. 
See Plaintiffs' Joint Preliminary  [*7] Case Statement (""PJCS"") (D.I. 872) at 18. They include Hewlett-Packard (""HP""), which 
acquired Compaq Computer (""Compaq"") in 2002, Dell, IBM, which sold its PC (but not server) business to Lenovo in May 2005, 
Fujitsu, and Fujitsu-Siemens. Id. Acer, which completed its purchase of Gateway/emachines in October 2007, NEC, Toshiba, 
and Sony are commonly considered Tier 1 OEMs, the last two principally in the notebook segment of the PC market. Id. Dell and 
HP are the dominant players, accounting for over 30% of the worldwide desktop and mobile sales, and almost 60% of worldwide 
server sales. Id. "
33,2," The Amended Briefing Schedule was further amended on four  [*24] separate occasions. (On April 16, 2009 (D.I. 1707 and D.I.

33,3," At the Special Master's request Dr. Leffler provided a revised Reply Declaration on August 29, 2009. (D.I. 2069). The revised 
Reply Declaration was the same in substance but added certain missing citations. "

available information)."
35,10," By correspondence dated April 12, 2010, the Special Master advised counsel that the Report and Recommendations 
Regarding Intel's Corporation's Motion to Preclude New Analyses ""was in the nature of a motion in limine . . . [and] any party 
choosing to file objections to the Special Master's Order. . . shall do so subsequent to the Hearing."" (D.I. 2408). Counsel 
confirmed the Special Master's directive with a Stipulation and Order to the same effect. (D.I. 2466). "
36,11,"  A. Intel Database: Intel Lump Sum = Intel Total Payments — Intel Price Discounts B. OEM Allocations Not In Intel Database i. Dell Database: Dell Price Discounts ii. Others: Estimate Percent Missing (% Missing) from comparison of Dell Database to Intel Database % Missing = (Dell Price Discount - Intel Dell Price Discount)/ Intel Dell Price Discount C. Total Loyalty Payments = Intel Lump Sum - (Dell Price Discount - Intel Dell Price Discount) - (1 + %M) * Others Price 
Discount (D.I. 2456, Class Hearing — Leffler Exh. 59)."
36,12," Intel objected to ""Issue 1"" listed on Class Hearing — Leffler Exhibit 58, objected in part to ""Issue 2"", and did not object to 
""Issue 3"" on Exhibit 58. (D.I. 2439) at 703:13-18. The Special Master permitted Dr. Leffler to testify regarding Class Hearing — 
Leffler Exhibits 58-61, for Intel to make a record regarding these slides, and to treat Intel's objection as a motion to strike after 
Dr. Leffler's testimony. Id. at 704:12-24. After a brief recess, Class Plaintiffs withdrew Exhibits 59 and 60, offering slides 59A and 
60A, and Intel cross-examined Dr. Leffler on original exhibits 59 and 60. (D.I. 2439) at 707:9-24. "
40,13," Intel does not challenge the sufficiency of Dr. Leffler's qualifications. See Intel's Memorandum in Support of Motion to Exclude 
(D.I. 1255) at 1. Thus, factor seven weighs in favor of admission of Dr. Leffler's testimony, without the Special Master having to 
address the sufficiency of Dr. Leffler's qualifications."
40,14," Class Plaintiffs cite two cases in support of their argument that Dr. Leffler's testimony should not be excluded by the Court, but 
should be assessed by the jury. See Motion to Exclude Opposition (D.I. 2016) at 8-9 (citing Stecyk v. Bell Helicopter Textron, 
Inc., 295 F.3d 408, 414 (3d Cir. 2002), McLean v. 988011 Ontario, Ltd., 224 F.3d 797, 801 (6th Cir. 2000)). The Special Master 
concludes that these cases do not support Class Plaintiffs' arguments. In Stecyk, the Court held that ""[i]t is an abuse of 
discretion to admit expert testimony which is based on assumptions lacking any factual foundation in the record."" 295 F.3d at 
414. The court admitted the expert testimony at issue because it ""reflect[ed] a factual foundation sufficient to support . . . [the 
expert's]  [*48] testimony."" Id. In the matter sub judice, the Special Master concludes that Dr. Leffler's opinions are inadmissible 
pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 702 precisely because he has not demonstrated a factual foundation for his opinions. See also 
McLean, 224 F.3d at 801 (causation expert's conclusions must ""have a basis in established fact and cannot be premised on 
mere suppositions"" and must ""find some support for those assumptions in the record.""). "
41,15," Dr. Leffler later amended the overcharge to ""at least 14% or so lower"". See Deposition of Dr. Keith Leffler dated October 8, 
2009 (""Leffler Dep. Tr. II"") (D.I. 2270, Exh. 2) at 799:3-5."
41,16," Dr. Leffler states that ""[t]he statistical analysis need not be specific to microprocessors. The question of interest is how 
retailers and OEMs react to cost changes, from whatever source,  [*51] that approximates the size of an Intel microprocessor 
overcharge."" See Leffler Decl. I (D.I. 920) at ¶ 96, n. 146."
41,17, The reliability of the Dell data is addressed separately below.
41,18," Intel points out that, in answering why the Mercury research data had been relegated to a footnote, Dr. Leffler responded that 
the Mercury Research data was ""not to be given any particular weight at all."" See Leffler Dep. II (D.I. 2270, Exh. 2) at 400:14-
401:1. The Special Master concludes that, although stated inartfully, a full reading of Dr. Leffler's testimony reveals that Dr. 
Leffler did not literally mean that the Mercury Research data was to be given less weight than other data in his analysis. Rather, 
the Special Master concludes that Dr. Leffler was merely explaining his use of a footnote in the text of his report. Id. at 400:25-
401:1. "
42,19," ""Stacking"", ""short for stacked generalization, is a term of art in the field of statistics referring to combining results of different 
models."" See In re GPU, 253 F.R.D. at 494 (internal citations omitted). "
43,20," Class Plaintiffs' response is that ""Intel makes no showing whatsoever that larger cost changes are passed on at any different 
rate than smaller cost changes.  [*57] Indeed, Intel can identify no bias, which is the only relevant economic question, in the 
pass-on estimation of the Internet regression."" See Motion to Exclude Opposition (D.I. 2016) at 13. The Special Master 
concludes that Class Plaintiffs fail to address the fact that Dr. Leffler's regression analysis does not isolate the alleged Intel 
overcharge by comparing different processors of different qualities and failing to control for quality differences."
43,21," Intel claims that Dr. Leffler's retailer regressions do not address the relationship between Intel's microprocessor price and the 
downstream computer price because they relate solely to one link in the distribution chain — the retailer link. See Motion to 
Exclude (D.I. 1254) at 13. Class Plaintiffs counter that Dr. Leffler's regressions, when considered ""as a group"" demonstrates that 
""the probability of higher PC costs not being passed on is 'less than one hundredth of one percent.'"" See  [*60] Motion to 
Exclude Opposition (D.I. 2016) at 8. The Special Master does not address that specific argument here but instead focuses on 
the other analytical gaps in Dr. Leffler's retailer regressions. "
44,22," Intel also makes the argument that Class Plaintiffs' impact opinions depend on the false premise that Class Plaintiffs will prove 
exclusionary acts that substantially predate the class period. See Motion to Exclude (D.I. 1254) at 6. The Special Master does 
not consider the embedded overcharge issue in connection with Intel's Motion to Exclude. However, the Special Master notes 
that Dr. Leffler testified in August, 2008 that an alleged Intel overcharge would need to be ""imbedded"" two years prior to the start 
of the class period. See Leffler Dep. Tr. 1 (D.I. 2270, Exh. 1) at 105:3-21. On July 23, 2009, in his Reply Declaration, Dr. Leffler 
states that ""four to eight months, is required between any illegal acts that began or continued at some point and the beginning of 
the class period to assure that the impact of the monopolization  [*62] has flowed through to PC prices."" (D.I. 2020) at ¶ 47. Dr. 
Leffler assumed, as part of his analysis, that the alleged Intel overcharge was imbedded. See Leffler Dep. Tr. I (D.I. 2270, Exh. I) 
at 105:5-8. The Special Master questions the reliability of this assumption where Dr. Leffler significantly changes his assumption 
without any articulated reason, and did not provide any empirical reasons for making this assumption in the first place."
44,23," See Declaration of Dr. Keith Leffler dated July 23, 2009 (""Leffler Decl. II"") (D.I. 2020) at Table 7 and 7A-C."
44,24," The Special Master notes that Dr. Leffler also used averages to calculate prices that Dell charged on those two days during 
2006, creating the same problem of averaging with respect to price data caused by an averaging of cost data. See Kaplan Decl. 
II (D.I. 2273, Exh. 47). "
45,25," The retailer regressions include regressions for Costco, CompUSA, CDW and PCMall. Dr. Leffler also testified that he did not 
take into account rebates to the ultimate purchaser in his regression analysis because he asserts rebates would exist to the 
same extent in the real world as in the ""but for"" world. See Leffler Dep. Tr. I (D.I. 2270, Exh. I) at 393:15-394:15. The Special 
Master concludes that Dr. Leffler's explanation is insufficient because he fails to account for real world facts that create 
individualized issues among proposed class members, i.e. that some purchasers may have paid hundreds of dollars less than 
others because they took advantage of a rebates. Dr. Leffler testified that studies report that under  [*66] fifty percent of people 
redeem such rebates. Id. at 395:11-16. Indeed Dr. Leffler makes the point that some indirect purchasers take advantage of 
rebates, other do not - real world facts that cannot be ignored. "
46,26," See also Deposition Transcript of Daniel Allen (""Allen Dep. Tr."") (D.I. 2018, Tab 202) at 353:9-22, 618:10-619:12 (Dell could 
use meet competition funds as they chose to, and even though Intel felt too many dollars were going to bottom line, rather than 
to the cost of goods sold (COGS), Dell chose to apply the funds as they chose); Deposition Transcript of Duane Zitner (D.I. 
2270, Exh. 14) at 164:21-165:5 (HP witness explained that credits in 2002 agreement were ""dollar payments to HP on a quarter 
that we could use to offset the cost of the processors that we were buying""); AMD's 30(b)(6) Dep. Written Responses, Topic 12 
(D.I. 2270, Exh. 8) (""We know enough anecdotal information to know there  [*71] is no consistent pattern. Some OEMs account 
for anticipated rebates at the product line level and take them into account for pricing, some at the corporate P&L level and do 
not take them into account for pricing, and they vary in making the choices and make different choices at different times for 
reasons known to them and not us.""). "
47,27," Dr. Leffler testified that OEMS had ""some discretion to use loyalty or lump sum payments to lower microprocessor prices."" See 
Class Cert. Hrng. Tr. (D.I. 2439) at 448:14-19. "
48,28," ""In February 2006, IBM paid a price of $119.29 for 209 units. This may have been another special competitive situation."" See 
Leffler Decl. I (D.I. 920) at n.90 (emphasis added)."
48,29," While the Special Master understands that ""an art"" may refer to a method that is based in science, nonetheless the method 
has to be more than just a thin-air assertion."
48,30," Intel argues that Dr. Leffler's methodology contradicts Class Plaintiffs' theory of a contestable/non-contestable market. See 
Motion to Exclude (D.I. 1254) at 13. The Special Master does not consider this argument in deciding Intel's Motion to Exclude, 
except to note that Dr. Leffler's precise definition of a non-contestable portion of the market (one that ""is more difficult for an 
entrant to break in[to]"") differs from Class Plaintiffs' definition of a non-contestable market. See Leffler Dep. Tr. I (D.I. 2270, Exh. 
1) at 146:3-4. "
49,31," Class Plaintiffs simply state that there is ""no need for Prof. Leffler to exclude such foreign conduct from his analysis."" See 
Motion  [*81] to Exclude Opposition (D.I. 2016) at 22."
49,32,"  A. Intel Database: Intel Lump Sum = Intel Total Payments - Intel Price Discounts B. OEM Allocations Not In Intel Database i. Dell Database: Dell Price Discounts ii. Others: Estimate Percent Missing (% Missing) from comparison of Dell Database to Intel Database % Missing = (Dell Price Discount - Intel Dell Price Discount) / Intel Dell Price Discount C. Total Loyalty Payments = Intel Lump Sum - (Dell Price Discount -  [*82] Intel Dell Price Discount) - (I + %M) * Others 
Price Discount (D.I. 2456, Class Hearing- Leffler Exh. 59). "
50,33," Intel objected to ""Issue I"" listed on Class Hearing - Leffler Exhibit 58, objected in part to ""Issue 2"", and did not object to ""Issue 
3"" on Exhibit 58. See Class Cert. Hrng. Tr. (D.I. 2439) at 703:13-18. The Special Master permitted Dr. Leffler to testify regarding 
Class Hearing — Leffler Exhibits 58-61, for Intel to make a record regarding these demonstrative exhibits, and to treat Intel's 
objection as a motion to strike after Dr. Leffler's testimony. Id. at 704:12-24. After a brief recess, Class Plaintiffs withdrew 
Exhibits 59 and 60, offering slides 59A and 60A, and Intel cross-examined Dr. Leffler on original exhibits 59 and 60. Id. at 707: 9-
24."
50,34, The qualifications of Dr. Leffler weigh in Class Plaintiffs'  [*85] favor and are not challenged by Intel. 
55,35," Class Plaintiffs rely on Kohen v. Pac. Invest. Mgmt., 571 F.3d 672, 2009 U.S. App. LEXIS 14943, at *12 (7th Cir. 2009) for the 
proposition that the class will often include individuals who have not been injured by the defendant's conduct. See Class Cert. 
Reply (D.I. 2017) at 17. At the same time, the Kohen court recognized that ""if the definition is so broad that it sweeps within it 
persons who could not have been injured by the defendant's conduct, it is too broad"" and ""a class should not be certified if it is 
apparent that it contains a great many persons who have suffered no injury at the hands of the defendant"", which is precisely the 
case here. Class Plaintiffs' reliance on Kohen is, in the Special Master's view, therefore misplaced. Similarly, the Special Master 
concludes that Class Plaintiffs' reliance on GPU II, 253 F.R.D. at 503 (internal citations omitted) is also misplaced. The GPU II 
 [*101] Court noted that ""courts have allowed indirect-purchaser plaintiffs to proceed as a class where they are unable to 
establish injury as to a few class members but can show 'widespread injury to the class'"", but plaintiffs ""must first demonstrate 
that there is way to prove injury to direct purchasers on a common formulaic basis"" before demonstrating widespread injury. 
Class Plaintiffs have not made such a showing. "
56,36," ""Economically a 'discount' is a price reduction if the cost to an OEM of additional (marginal) microprocessors is lower because 
of the discount. A payment, the amount of which does not vary with marginal purchases, is not a price reduction."" See Leffler 
Decl. II (D.I. 2020) at ¶ 7, n. 12. "
57,37," The Special Master notes that Class Plaintiffs seem to use the terms loyalty payments, bribes, and rebates interchangeably. 
According to Class Plaintiffs, ""Intel's loyalty payments lowered the overall cost to the OEM recipients of doing business with 
Intel."" Class Certification Reply Brief (D.I. 2017) at 25."
57,38," Notwithstanding Class Plaintiffs' assertion that Intel misunderstood Class Plaintiffs' theory, it may be helpful to understand that 
the Special Master shared Intel's view of Class Plaintiffs' stated theory - namely that ""all of Intel's rebate schemes are 
discriminatory and market-foreclosing."" See FACC (D.I. 108) at ¶ 171 (emphasis added). "
59,39," Attached as Appendix ""B"" hereto is a list of instances wherein Class Plaintiffs themselves assert that ""some"", not ""all"", of Intel's 
monetary concessions led to higher microprocessor prices. "
60,40," The document notes that this money is an offset to COGS, ""cost of goods sold"" and is therefore a discount. See Shah Decl. 
(D.I. 2322, Exh. 16) at DELL-0019-0005595. "
63,41," Even AMD observed in principle that individual analysis is necessary to determine how much of Intel's monetary concessions 
were passed on to indirect purchasers because OEMs had discretion with respect to how to use these funds: We know enough anecdotal information to know that there is no consistent pattern. Some OEMs account for anticipated 
rebates at the product line level and take them into account for pricing, some at the corporate P&L level and do not take 
them into account for pricing, and they vary in making the choices and make different choices at different times for reasons 
known to them and not us. See Beach Decl. (D.I. 2270, Exh. 8) (AMD 30(b)(6) Written Responses, Topic 12). "
65,42," See Class Certification Hrng. Tr. (D.I. 2439) at 345:19-23 (Dr. Leffler testified that: ""I looked at all the desktop processors, I 
compared their pricing in the first quarter of 2006, and then 1 looked at their pricing ... both in the third quarter and in the second 
half of 2006.""). "
67,43," Dr. Leffler testified at his deposition and at the Class Certification Hearing that the ""Celeron"" processor was a so-called legacy 
product, a product at ""the end of its life"", an ""old processor"" that had ""very few sales"" and thus an increase in price in the 
second-half of 2006 for these processors was not something he ""paid attention to"". See Leffler Dep. Tr. II (D.I. 2270, Exh. 2) at 
694:5-16; Class Cert. Hrng. Tr. (D.I. 2439) at  [*138] 349:19-353:20 (stating that legacy chips are sold in ""very small quantities"" 
but ""there's no competition . . . with respect to a chip that old"", and pricing plays ""little role in any sales""; Pentium 3 chips were 
legacy chips). According to Dr. Leffler, the price of legacy products are a ""function of its past price not its current price"" and he 
""included it to be conservative"". See Leffler Dep. Tr. II (D.I. 2270, Exh. 2) at 694:24-695:7. "
70,44," Intel  [*149] cites to the expert report of Dr. Thomas Z. Lys, Ph.D. (""Dr. Lys""), AMD's expert, but Dr. Lys considered a different 
issue - how long it would take AMD to become ""an effective competitor to Intel"" if ""a but for world that is free of all of Intel's 
exclusionary conduct begins in Q3 2001."" See Beach. Decl. (D.I. 2270) at Exh. 27 at ¶ 27. The Special Master concludes that 
Dr. Lys' analysis is different than Dr. Leffler's analysis that it would take four to eight months to two years for an alleged Intel 
overcharge to affect an indirect purchaser. See also Leffler Dep. Tr. 1 (D.I. 2270, Exh. 1) at 121:9-18. "
71,45," Dr. Leffler denied the existence of a ""non-contestable"" portion of the market in the literal sense. See Leffler Dep. Tr. I (D.I. 
2270), Exh. 1 at 143:21-144:13 (""they don't literally mean its non-contested. They just mean its harder, that's all""). The Special 
Master notes that this yet another example of a divergence in views between Class Plaintiffs and their expert. "
73,46," See Appendix ""C"" hereto."
73,47," See Appendix ""D"", Parts 1 and 2, hereto."
73,48," On July 16, 2010, Intel submitted Sullivan v. DB Investments, Inc., 613 F.3d 134, 153-154 (2010) (holding, in the context of a 
nationwide settlement class, that district court abuses its discretion when it certifies a nationwide class of litigants whose claims 
implicate the laws of multiple jurisdictions, despite the fact that only some of those jurisdictions recognize the claims for which 
recovery is sought). (D.I. 2468). The Special Master concludes that Sullivan is not applicable because that case concerned a 
nationwide class whose claims implicate the laws of multiple jurisdictions, 613 F.3d at 154. On the other hand, in the matter sub 
judice, Class Plaintiffs seek to certify a nationwide damages class applying California law. At the same time, Class Plaintiffs' 
reliance on Sullivan is misplaced. Unlike Sullivan, where the Court distinguished In re Warfarin Sodium Antitrust Litig., 391 F.3d 
at 528, a case where all members of the class shared a common state claim, the members of this proposed class do not share a 
state claim in common. See Sullivan, 613 F.3d 134, 152, n.15. Sullivan has no impact  [*160] on the Special Master's analysis of 
Class Plaintiffs' request for certification of a class for injunctive relief pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). "
76,49," Class Plaintiffs' reliance on the recent decision of the California Supreme Court in the case of Clayworth v. Pfizer, Inc., 49 Cal. 
4th 758, 783, 233 P.3d 1066, 111 Cal. Rptr. 3d 666 (Cal. 2010) for the proposition that the ""primary concern"" of California's 
antitrust laws ""is . . . the elimination of restraints of trade and impairments of the free markets"" perpetrated by businesses 
located in California directed inter alia at other California companies,  [*171] see generally 49 Cal. 4th at 783-784, in the Special 
Master's view lends nothing to this analysis. "

Anderson dismissed the action against News Group (Dkt. #3.)"
93,3," Source was the plaintiff in a related antitrust conspiracy action (the ""Source Action"") (1:09-cv-02227.) The Source Action has 
since settled."
93,4," Anderson originally brought a claim for defamation but has since withdrawn this claim (Pf. Mem. at 30, n 21.) "
95,5," See below, note 6."
95,6," The Complaint alleges that Defendant AMI participated in the boycott of Anderson, (Comp. ¶ 47),  [**13] but judicial 
proceedings establish the opposite. An Order of the Delaware Chancery Court determined that AMI continued to ship magazines 
to Anderson in February of 2009. See American Media, Inc. v. Anderson News, L.L.C., Index. No.: 4369-VCL. The doctrine of 
collateral estoppel allows the Court to take judicial notice of that Order since AMI and Anderson were parties to that dispute. See 
Jacobs v. Law Offices of Leonard N. Flamm, 2005 WL 1844642, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. 2005). As discussed below, based on the Order 
of the Delaware Chancery Court, the Court rejects Anderson's antitrust allegation as to AMI. "
96,7," This allegation names Defendant Hudson along with non-party News Group. In a letter to the Court dated June 9, 2010, 
however, Anderson withdrew this allegation as to Hudson. "
97,8," See above, note 6."
97,9," Rather, Anderson relies on several vague statements by executives of some of the Defendants' regarding collusion (Comp. ¶¶ 
49, 50, 52, 54, 56.) These statements are insufficient. See below the discussion of the sufficiency of the antitrust allegations as 
to the Defendants individually. Anderson also relies heavily on paragraph 55 of the Complaint, which alleges that ""throughout the 
 [**20] latter part of January and the early days of February"" (i.e., the entire duration of the alleged conspiracy) certain unnamed 
defendants held ""numerous meetings"" in unspecified places; that (at some indeterminate date) Curtis, TWR, News Group, and 
Hudson, met at Hudson's New Jersey offices; and that during these alleged meetings, Defendants discussed dividing the U.S. 
distribution territory into two regions, one controlled by Defendant Hudson and the other by non-party News Group. Like the 
vague statements of some of the Defendants' executives, these allegations are also insufficient to plausibly suggest a prior 
agreement among Defendants. All Star Carts v. BFI Canada Income Fund et. al., 596 F. Supp. 2d 630, 641 (E.D.N.Y. 2009) 
(holding allegations of conspiracy that are general in nature and allude to nothing more than participation by ""defendants"" in 
""meetings"" are subject to dismissal); In re Elevator Antitrust Litig., 502 F.3d 47, 50-51 (2d Cir. 2007) (affirming district court 
dismissal of conspiracy claim where plaintiffs set forth nothing more than general assertions of meetings to agree on anti-
competitive conduct). "
98,10," In addition to the allegations in the Complaint, the Court takes judicial notice of the contents of The New Single Copy 
Interview, in which Mr. Anderson describes the Surcharge as an unconditional, non-negotiable ultimatum. Context is key in 
evaluating the plausibility of Sherman antitrust claims, and The New Single Copy Interview, fleshes out the background to the 
alleged conspiracy. Mr. Anderson undeniably made the statements in The New Single Copy Interview; Anderson knew about 
and possessed the contents of The New Single Copy Interview; and the Complaint references The New Single Copy Interview 
and briefly paraphrases its contents (Comp. ¶ 42.). See Sira v. Morton, 380 F.3d 57, 67 (2d Cir. 2004) (holding that courts will 
incorporate a written instrument into a complaint when the complaint references it); Chambers v. Time Warner, Inc., 282 F.3d 
147, 153 (2d Cir. 2002) (holding that where a complaint relies heavily on a document, courts may consider the document's 
contents). The Court would have reached the same decision even absent knowledge of the contents of the The New Single 
Copy Interview; the Complaint contains enough background information  [**25] regarding the Surcharge to undermine the 
plausibility of Anderson's allegations. Indeed, the Complaint itself speaks of Anderson's ""decision to impose"" the Surcharge, 
which is entirely consistent with the substance of Mr. Anderson's comments in the The New Single Copy Interview (Comp. ¶ 41.) "
103,11," The Court applies New York law to Anderson's common law claims because Anderson concedes that there is no conflict 
between New York law (the law of the forum) and the law of the other jurisdictions whose law Anderson has invoked. See Alitalia 
Linee Aeree Italiane, S.P.A. v. Airline Tariff Publ'g Co., 580 F. Supp. 2d 285, 290 (S.D.N.Y. 2008)."
103,12," Anderson's pleadings obscure the nature of its tortious interference claim. The Court construes Anderson's claim as one for 
tortious interference with business relations. Anderson's claim also fails if Anderson is in fact pleading a claim for tortious 
interference with contract. Anderson alleges that the Defendants forced Anderson to breach its contracts with single-copy 
magazine retailers. HN11[
] Under New York law, however, to state a claim for tortious interference with contract, a plaintiff 
must allege the procurement of a third-party breach of contract. Cont'l. Fin. Co. v. Ledwith, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 52618, 2009 
WL 1748875, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. June 22, 2009). "
112,1," Additionally, Plaintiffs have filed an unopposed motion to substitute Plaintiff David Terry for Plaintiff David Watson [105], and an 
unopposed motion to substitute Plaintiff Jacaranda, Inc. for Plaintiff Thomas Whittelsey [125]. These motions will be granted. "
113,2," Because this matter is before the Court on motions to dismiss, the Court must accept the factual allegations of the complaint as 
true, Hunnings v. Texaco, Inc., 29 F.3d 1480,1484 (11th Cir. 1994)."
113,3," Plaintiffs currently consist of the following twelve purchasers of Defendants' services who paid a first-bag fee on flights: Brent 
Avery; David Terry; Michael Edelson; Martin Siegel; Jacaranda, Inc.; Patricia Freedman; Stephen  [**9] Powell; Henryk J. 
Jachimowicz; Laura Greenberg Gale; Carla Dahl; and Victoria Mertes. Further details regarding each Plaintiff (including on 
which flights they traveled), which are not relevant to the present motions to dismiss, are set forth in the consolidated amended 
complaint and in the subsequent motions to substitute that have been filed by Plaintiffs."
113,4," The first-bag fee—which is at the heart of this litigation—involves the $15 fee that Defendants (and many other airlines) now 
charge for the first bag that a passenger checks. "
114,5," AirTran's first quarter earnings call was originally scheduled to occur on April 24, 2008, one day after Delta's first quarter 
earnings call. However, AirTran rescheduled the call to occur at 9:00 a.m. on April 22, the day before Delta's earnings call. 
Seizing upon this fact, Plaintiffs argue that AirTran intentionally rescheduled the call so that it could initiate collusive 
communications with Delta and allow Delta an opportunity to respond  [**12] at its own earnings call. AirTran counters that the 
rescheduling of the call had nothing to do with Delta. AirTran states that it moved the call so that it could respond to investor 
inquiries regarding a $150 million securities filing that was set to occur at 5:05 a.m. on April 22. Ordinarily, such conflicting 
interpretations regarding these events would favor Plaintiffs because on a motion to dismiss, the Court must accept the facts as 
alleged by Plaintiffs. However, subsequent correspondence between the parties (attached as an exhibit to Defendants' reply briefs in support of their 
motions to dismiss) sheds more light on this issue. Specifically, Plaintiffs had originally argued in their opposition brief to the 
motions to dismiss that the securities filing took place at 5:05 p.m. on April 22, which, if true, would have rendered implausible 
AirTran's argument that it had rescheduled the call to answer inquiries regarding the securities filing (if the filing did not take 
place until 5:05 p.m., then AirTran would not been able to utilize a 9:00 a.m. earnings call to answer inquiries regarding the 
filing). Since the filing of Plaintiffs' opposition brief, Plaintiffs now concede that they  [**13] misread the time stamp on the securities 
press release form and that the securities filing did in fact occur at 5:05 a.m. on April 22, thereby supporting AirTran's 
explanation. Plaintiffs have not offered any new argument to rebut AirTran's plausible explanation for the rescheduling of the 
call. Nevertheless, even if AirTran's motivation in rescheduling the call had nothing to do with Delta, such a fact does not render 
implausible Plaintiffs' core allegation that AirTran also used the call as an opportunity to invite Delta to collude. "
118,6," The Eleventh Circuit has adopted as binding precedent the decisions of the former Fifth Circuit rendered prior to October 1, 
1981. Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir. 1981) (en banc). "
119,7," Although Plaintiffs originally sought class-wide treatment for their claims under § 2 of the Sherman Act, it has come to the 
Court's attention that they are no longer seeking relief on a class-wide basis with respect to those claims. "
120,8," Defendants make the mistake of relying upon summary judgment cases throughout their briefs. For example, Defendants also 
rely heavily upon Williamson Oil Co. v. Philip Morris USA, 346 F.3d 1287 (11th Cir. 2003). However, Williamson was a summary 
judgment case, and it explicitly  [**34] involved the evidentiary burden required of a plaintiff in a § 1 Sherman Act case at the 
summary judgment stage of the proceedings. There, the Eleventh Circuit held that to avoid summary judgment, a plaintiff must 
produce certain evidence, known as ""plus factors,"" which would tend to exclude the possibility that the alleged conspirators 
acted independently. Such a standard is not applicable at the motion to dismiss stage, where a plaintiff is only required to allege 
enough facts to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of an illegal agreement. Twombly, 550 U.S. at 
556. "
121,9," Defendants  [**39] take Plaintiffs to task because the complaint neither describes the specific routes on which capacity was 
reduced nor identifies the specific time periods during which these capacity reductions took place. At this stage of the 
proceedings, the Court is not convinced that Plaintiffs are required to provide such a high level of detail, and Plaintiffs have 
indicated that they are willing to provide further details to Defendants on this issue."
121,10," Plaintiffs allege in their complaint that AirTran and Delta participated in investor conferences in which break-out discussions 
between executives occurred regarding pricing and other industry issues. Defendants argue that Plaintiffs' reliance upon these 
break-out sessions is in error because a so-called opportunity to conspire cannot, standing alone, sustain a claim of an 
agreement to restrain trade. See In re Travel Agent Comm'n Antitrust Litig., 583 F.3d 896, 911 (6th Cir. 2009). Although this is a 
correct statement of the law, Plaintiffs have alleged much more in their complaint than just the existence of these break-out 
sessions. The Court rejects Defendants' argument that Plaintiffs should be barred from exploring the content of these break-out 
 [**40] discussions during discovery to determine what exactly was discussed and whether these discussions may support 
Plaintiffs' overall theory of this case. "
123,11," In reaching this conclusion, the Court also finds it noteworthy that Defendants' conduct is currently being investigated by the 
Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice. "
124,12," Notably, Defendants have not cited any cases in which the securities laws precluded an antitrust challenge to collusion 
reached through public disclosures. "
125,13," Plaintiffs also argue in cursory fashion that Noerr-Pennington does not apply because Defendants  [**52] were negotiating 
with the City of Atlanta in its ""commercial capacity"" as landlord of Hartsfield-Jackson, rather than its governmental or political 
capacity. However, it is unclear whether a so-called commercial exception to the Noerr-Pennington doctrine exists in the 
Eleventh Circuit. See TEC Cogeneration, Inc. v. Fla. Power & Light Co., 76 F.3d 1560,1573 (11th Cir. 1996) (noting that the 
""Supreme Court and this circuit have never expressly considered the validity of . . . the commercial exception to the Noerr-
Pennington doctrine, and we are not required to do so now.""). Without further guidance from the Eleventh Circuit on this issue or 
more extensive briefing by the parties, the Court is not inclined to adopt such an exception at this time. "
126,14," HN16[
] Section 2 of the Sherman Act is directed against ""[e]very person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several 
States."" 15 U.S.C. § 2. Thus, under the statute, there are three distinct claims that can be brought: (1) monopolization; (2) 
attempt to monopolize; and (3) conspiracy to monopolize. As has been explained, Plaintiffs elected to proceed pursuant to prong 
(2) alleging that Defendants engaged in attempted monopolization. The fact that a separate offense (a conspiracy claim) exists 
under the statute for concerted action pertaining to monopolization suggests that any joint monopoly theory must be brought 
pursuant to that subsection of the statute rather than pursuant to the ""attempted monopolization"" prong. See Carpet Group, Int'l 
v. Oriental Rug Importers Ass'n, 256 F. Supp. 2d 249, 283-85 (D.N.J. 2003) (noting that ""[b]y their very terms, section 2's 
monopolization and attempted monopolization claims prohibit unilateral action""). Thus, this observation further undercuts 
Plaintiffs' joint attempted monopolization theory."
126,15," Moreover,  [**57] the few cases cited by Plaintiffs that lend support to their theory involved evidence of joint monopolization 
that are much more egregious than the facts alleged here. In particular, in United States v. American Airlines, Inc., 743 F.2d 
1114 (5th Cir. 1984), upon which Plaintiffs principally rely, the court was faced with direct and unequivocal efforts to enlist 
competitors in working cartels. Accordingly, to the extent that a shared monopoly theory for an attempted monopolization claim 
is a viable legal doctrine in this circuit, the Court finds that the facts presented in this case do not warrant its application. "
127,16," Moreover, Plaintiffs' proposed language for the injunction that it seeks is problematic. Plaintiffs seek to enjoin Defendants 
""from sharing actual and potential future competitive actions concerning pricing and capacity cuts in forums monitored by its 
competitors."" However, HN19[
] merely stating future plans—such as announcing prices—does not constitute an antitrust 
violation. In re LTL Shipping Servs., 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14276, 2009 WL 323219, at *8 (""A Plaintiff . . . cannot state an 
antitrust claim by showing only that the Defendants made price information publicly available""). Indeed, as requested, the 
injunction could tread on Defendants' First Amendment rights because it would render it unlawful for Defendants to disclose any 
pricing or capacity plans. Although Plaintiffs' proposed language for the injunction could presumably be limited and altered by 
the Court at a later date, this deficiency further reveals the flaws in Plaintiffs' § 2 Sherman Act claims. "
136,1, There is a pending motion for class certification.
136,2, All references to docket numbers are to the docket in No. 2:08-md-1000. 
137,3," Plaintiffs also appear to have engaged in what was referred to during the undersigned's days of practice before state courts as 
a ""paper dump"" in response to the motion for summary judgment. In other words, it appears  [**11] that part of the plaintiffs' 
strategy has been to file an inordinate amount of paper in this case and to address many, many immaterial and irrelevant facts 
as far as the motion for summary judgement is concerned. In state court parlance, plaintiffs' goal appears to have been to 
convince the court that, somewhere in this huge volume of paper, there must be a disputed issue of material fact sufficient to 
defeat defendants' motion for summary judgment. Although the Court has not chosen to strike any of plaintiffs' pleadings related 
to this motion, plaintiffs are forewarned that such conduct in the future may well result in having pleadings stricken from the 
record."
137,4," At the time of its formation, NDH had four (4) partners: (1) DFA, (2) Allen Meyer (a business partner of DFA's CEO), (3) Tex 
Beshears, and (4) Tracy Noll (former Suiza senior executives). DFA owned half of NDH and the individual partners collectively 
owned the other half The plaintiffs premise a fair part of their argument on its allegation that DFA controlled NDH. At a minimum, this will be a matter 
for the jury to decide. "
138,5," The plaintiffs argue that DFA created NDH as a false competitor, vested it with weak assets, including ""second-best"" plants, 
and guaranteed its failure as a competitor by staffing it with unqualified managers and making decisions which were against its 
economic interests. "
139,6, Dean and NDH list approximately 30 examples of claimed competition in support of their argument. 
140,7," Although plaintiffs make this allegation in their amended complaint, they do not mention it in their response to the instant 
motion and appear to have abandoned the argument."
140,8," Flagship was a venture, in 2005, according to plaintiffs, which sought to buy the new Atlanta Dairy and provide a vehicle for 
disgruntled dairy farmers to enter into the southeast bottling market. According to plaintiffs, Dean officials were concerned about 
losing millions of dollars and Dean prevailed upon DFA to relax its full supply agreements and allow Dean to buy milk from non-
DFA farmers, allowing Dean to keep those farmers within the Dean system rather than suppling Flagship. Plaintiffs cite a host of 
other evidence which they assert creates genuine issues of material fact as to Count I, and defendants respond to each in 
meticulous detail. "
144,9," In fact, as defendants argue, plaintiffs appear to acknowledge that they have suffered no direct harm from the alleged 
conspiracy involving raw milk. In their response to defendants' motion, they state: . . . Defendants' agreement was simple: DFA would help Dean raise prices for bottled (also called ""processed"") milk by 
creating and controlling  [**38] a faux competitor, by collusively reducing bottled milk output, and by otherwise conspiring 
with Dean to artificially increase bottled milk prices. Dean, for its part, would help DFA dominate the raw-milk market by 
granting DFA the right to supply substantially all of Dean's raw-milk needs. It was the first half of this agreement, the portion that raised bottled milk prices, that directly harmed Retailer Plaintiffs. 
(emphasis added) [Doc. 538, p. 1]. Furthermore, the ""first half"" of this alleged agreement appears to be the very same separate conspiracy alleged 
in Count I of the plaintiffs' amended complaint. "
145,10, Defendants' motion for  [**43] summary judgment focuses exclusively on this element. 
146,11," As defendants note in their response to plaintiffs' supplemental brief, plaintiffs appear to have now defined a different product 
market than they did in their complaint. Dr. Froeb opines that the relevant product is ""fresh white fluid milk, excluding such 
alternate beverages as flavored milk, extended shelf life milk, organic and hormone free milk, buttermilk, lactose-free and 
lactose-reduced milk, and soy and rice milk."" In their amended complaint, plaintiffs allege that  [**44] the relevant product market 
consists of ""Grade A milk, other than school milk, which has been pasteurized and processed for human consumption and then 
repackaged into containers which are sold to retail outlets and other customers."" "
147,12," High prices do not necessarily suggest monopoly power. See Bailey v. Allgas, Inc., 284 F.3d 1237, 1252-53 (11th Cir. 2002)."
147,13," The most logical inference to be drawn from this statement is that Dean would reduce its price to meet competition. At best, 
the statement is ambiguous."
147,14," Although made in a different context,  [**50] plaintiffs also claim that there is other direct evidence of Dean's monopoly power. 
Citing the Red Oak venture and the circumstances related to the Winn-Dixie plant in High Point, N.C. and the SuperValu plant in 
Richmond, plaintiffs claim Dean has taken ""unilateral"" efforts to eliminate or block competitors. They also point to evidence of 
non-competition agreements, plant closings and restrictive deed covenants to keep closed bottling plants closed. If anything, this 
is circumstantial, not direct, evidence and is clearly ambiguous evidence when considered on this issue. "
148,15," Plaintiffs' shifting positions with respect to their response to defendants' motion for summary judgment on the monopolization 
claims has been a source of frustration and delay for the Court. When the Court initially suggested to the parties at the July 1, 
2009 status conference that these issues might better be resolved through a motion for summary judgment rather than a motion 
to dismiss, the Court specifically asked plaintiffs whether they would need additional discovery to respond to such a motion. 
Counsel for plaintiffs responded that he ""[didn't] think so."" Yet plaintiffs filed, along with their response to the motion for summary 
judgment, the declaration of counsel ""pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(f)"" that they could not ""yet fully respond to 
defendants' motion for summary judgment with respect to the issues of market definition and market power,"" primarily because 
 [**52] expert reports had not yet been completed. Despite the fact that expert opinions likely have little, if any, bearing on the 
question of whether genuine issues of material fact exist, the Court delayed ruling on the motion and allowed supplemental 
responses to be filed. Plaintiffs have now had a full opportunity to respond to defendants' motion."
148,16," Professor Froeb is an Associate Professor of Entrepreneurship and Free Enterprise at Vanderbilt University's Owen Graduate 
School of Management."
148,17, Plaintiffs do not identify what this additional evidence is by citation to the record.
148,18," Professor Froeb's proposed market apparently includes part of order 5, part of order 7, part of order 1, and parts of Virginia 
that are regulated at the state level."
148,19," Plaintiffs refer to Professor Froeb's definition of the relevant market as ""slightly different than the one that was pleaded."""
148,20," Professor Froeb also concludes that the boundaries of Federal Milk Marketing Orders 5 and 7 constitute the relevant market 
for purposes of plaintiffs' claims under Count II. The plaintiffs see their midstream change of direction with respect to the relevant 
market as no impediment to the pursuit of their claims. They argue that ""numerous courts have recognized that the evidence in a 
case may support a market with contours that differ from those  [**54] pled in a complaint once discovery has been obtained and 
expert analysis performed."" Plaintiffs cite two district court decisions as support for their claim that numerous courts have so 
recognized. Dean sees this change in plaintiffs' position as an improper effort to amend their complaint and argue that there is 
no authority which permits a party to withstand summary judgment by fundamentally geographic market alleged in its complaint. While it appears that the two district court cases cited by plaintiffs do not fully support the proposition asserted by the plaintiffs, 
the Court need not decide this issue since plaintiffs have failed to establish that any genuine issue of material fact exists on the 
issue of the relevant geographic market. The Court does note, however, that market definition is a fact intensive inquiry. "
149,21," In addition, although not argued by defendants, such an approach ignores the class action allegation of the amended 
complaint."
149,22," Plaintiffs filed their July 10 supplemental brief without leave of court long after the time for response had passed, making the 
dubious argument that such filing was ""consistent with Magistrate Judge Inman's April 6, 2010 Order"" granting leave to 
supplement the summary judgment record with the full expert report of Professor Froeb. Defendants have not moved to strike 
the brief and the Court will not do so on its own motion. Attached to the brief is a ""rebuttal report"" from Professor Froeb dated 
June 28, 2010, in the form of a declaration. In the declaration, Professor Froeb states that he ""remain[s] convinced"" that his 
earlier conclusions ""are true and sound."" He also defends his methodology, as noted in the body of this memorandum opinion, 
as the same methodology he ""would have employed and would have directed [his] staff to undertake had this issue come before 
[him]  [**58] during [his] employment at the Department of Justice or at the Federal Trade Commission."""
149,23," Plaintiffs, throughout their pleadings, suggest that somehow their cause is advanced because Dean and its experts have not 
defined an alternative geographic market. In fact, Professor Froeb expressed  [**59] ""disappointment"" that Professors Kolt and 
Elzinga ""[do] not present an alternative to [his] defined markets."" These arguments represent a fundamental misunderstanding of 
the burden of proof and the burden of opposition to a motion for summary judgment."
149,24," Professor Froeb was Director of the Bureau of Economics at the Federal Trade Commission from 2003 to 2005. He was an 
economist at the Antitrust Division at the Department of Justice prior to his employment at Vanderbilt University. "
150,25," As noted above, plaintiffs have abandoned their argument that the relevant geographic market can be defined using the 
boundaries of Federal Milk Marketing Orders 5 and 7."
150,26," Plaintiffs claim that ""Professor Froeb's opinion presents direct evidence of Dean's market power . . ."" [Doc. 765, p. 7]. It is 
doubtful if ""opinions"" can ever create a genuine issue of material fact. Plaintiffs further claim that this direct evidence of market 
power is corroborated by indirect evidence of Dean's market power based on Dean's market share. As noted elsewhere in the 
opinion, the ""corroborating evidence that Dean possess a market share in excess of 67%"" is based on Dr. Froeb's 
""extrapolation."" "
167,1," The district court also enjoined Maine from enforcing parts of section 1711-E implementing section 1171-E(2-A). See Rowe, 
532 F. Supp. 2d at 183. "
168,2," These facts rely in part on this court's discussion of the same industry, and plaintiffs' role in that industry, in our 2008 Ayotte 
opinion. The parties have relied heavily on those facts and the record from Ayotte."
168,3," When Merck marketed Vioxx, for example, it used a wealth of prescriber-identifying data to create monthly reports on individual 
prescribers in each detailer's assigned territory. The reports showed how many Merck versus non-Merck drugs the prescriber 
prescribed and estimated how many of these prescriptions could be substituted for Merck products. Merck then tracked its 
detailers' progress in converting prescribers in their territories to the Merck brand and gave detailers bonuses based  [**8] on 
Merck's sales volume and market share in the detailer's territory. "
170,4," Plaintiffs also sell or license other databases and reports to other clients, including governments, nonprofit organizations, and 
research institutions."
170,5," Pharmaceutical manufacturers may also use plaintiffs' data for other purposes, like to send out alerts about  [**13] particular 
drugs to prescribers who have been prescribing it or for research and development."
170,6," HN6[
] ""Marketing"" includes ""[a]dvertising, publicizing, promoting or selling a prescription drug;"" ""activities undertaken for the 
purpose of influencing the market share of a prescription  [**14] drug or the prescribing patterns of a prescriber, a detailing visit 
or a personal appearance;"" ""[a]ctivities undertaken to evaluate or improve the effectiveness of a professional detailing sales 
force;"" or ""[a] brochure, media advertisement or announcement, poster or free sample of a prescription drug."" Id. § 1711-E(1)(F-
1). ""'Marketing' does not include pharmacy reimbursement, formulary compliance, pharmacy file transfers in response to a patient 
request or as a result of the sale or purchase of a pharmacy, patient care management, utilization review by a health care 
provider or agent of a health care provider or the patient's health plan or an agent of the patient's health plan, and health care 
research."" Id."
170,7," This circuit upheld New Hampshire's statute, which categorically prohibits certain entities, including plaintiffs, from licensing, 
transferring, using, or selling any prescriber-identifying data for a commercial purpose. N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 318:47-f; 
 [**15] Ayotte, 550 F.3d at 47. The Vermont statute instead prohibits certain entities from selling, licensing, exchanging, or 
permitting the use of records containing prescriber-identifying data when marketing or promoting prescription drugs unless the 
prescriber has affirmatively consented to such uses. See Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 18, § 4631(d); IMS Health Inc. v. Sorrell, 631 F. Supp. 
2d 434, 443-44 (D. Vt. 2009). "
171,8," The Maine law contains a separate provision protecting  [**17] patient-identifiable data, which plaintiffs do not challenge. See 
Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 22, § 1711-E(2)."
171,9," HN11[
] Plaintiffs' fleeting assertion that section 1711-E's definition of a ""prescriber"" encompasses any prescriber [**18] anywhere is flatly contradicted by section 1711-E's statement of purpose, which states that the statutes' goals include ""to 
protect the privacy of . . . prescribers in the health care system of this State."" Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 22, § 1711-E(1-B)."
171,10," Those methods are (1) by signing and submitting an enclosed form to the Maine Health Data Organization; (2) by manually or 
electronically checking a box on the form; or (3) by linking to the Maine Health Data Organization website and filling out an 
electronic form. Id. § 1711-E(4)(A)(1)."
171,11," The Maine Health Data Organization maintains a health information database to benefit Maine citizens and develops data 
collection policies. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 22, § 8703(1); id. § 8704(1)(A). "
172,12," Though neither party has addressed who may enforce the Maine Unfair Trade Practices Act, it is undisputed that HN14[
] the attorney general can enforce section 1711-E on behalf of individuals through section 209 of the act. "
173,13," Plaintiffs' overbreadth argument, not addressed by the district court, consists of the bare assertion that the Maine law is 
overbroad because it prohibits the use of prescriber-identifying data when marketing all prescription drugs, not just those drugs 
without any obvious financial or health benefit to patients. That argument is at best an assertion that section 1711-E(2-A) is not 
narrowly tailored enough to serve Maine's interest in reducing health care costs. We rejected an analogous claim in Ayotte, see 
550 F.3d at 59-60, and the argument has no relevance to our alternate holding in Part III.B. "
174,14," Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. v. Greenmoss Builders, Inc., 472 U.S. 749, 105 S. Ct. 2939, 86 L. Ed. 2d 593 (1985), held that a 
consumer credit report made available by a reporting agency to particular subscribers received less First Amendment protection 
because it was ""solely in the individual interest of the speaker and its specific business audience."" Id. at 762. Though not 
explicitly labeled commercial speech, the Supreme Court nonetheless concluded that ""many  [**28] of the same concerns that 
argue in favor of reduced constitutional protection in those areas apply here as well."" Id. at 762 n.8. Applying these principles in an analogous context, the D.C. Circuit held that a blanket prohibition on an intermediary's sale of 
targeted marketing lists identifying particular consumers with desired characteristics was subject to lesser scrutiny. See Trans 
Union Corp. v. FTC, 245 F.3d 809, 818, 345 U.S. App. D.C. 301 (D.C. Cir. 2001). The reports and databases plaintiffs prepare to 
facilitate detailing are indistinguishable from these cases for First Amendment purposes. Still, we use the Central Hudson 
framework."
174,15," Though many of these unwanted solicitations invade individuals' right to be left alone in their homes, a location accorded 
special protection, Hill formulated this right as one that applies more broadly, with special but not exclusive force in the home. 
Hill, 530 U.S. at 717."
174,16," This reasoning also disposes of plaintiffs' assertion that section 1711-E(2-A) is a prior restraint on their speech because it 
allows prescribers to prevent plaintiffs from transferring or using their data. That argument rests on the mistaken assumption that 
plaintiffs have an absolute right to obtain prescriber-identifying data and to use it to facilitate unwelcome detailing practices. "
175,17," Plaintiffs also introduced evidence on an AMA initiative that allows medical doctors to signal that they do not want their 
prescribing data used in detailing. But the AMA has no real power to limit plaintiffs' and other intermediaries' use of this data; 
compliance is monitored only through complaints to the AMA, and enforcement depends on plaintiffs and other intermediaries' 
goodwill prevailing over the strong financial incentives to use this data. Moreover, the AMA scheme does not cover a host of 
prescribers like nurse practitioners or osteopathic physicians, who might want to protect their prescribing data but are ineligible 
for the AMA scheme. "
176,18," HN24[
] The  [**36] Commerce Clause, which gives Congress the authority to ""regulate Commerce . . . among the several States,"" U.S. Const. art I, § 8, cl. 3, also carries negative or implicit consequences for states' authority to regulate interstate 
commerce, referred to as the ""dormant Commerce Clause."" There is no claim that Congress has acted and that Maine's statute 
must fail on that basis."
176,19," In recent years, the Supreme Court has sharply distinguished between facial and as-applied challenges, stringently limiting the 
availability of the former. See, e.g., Wash. State Grange v. Wash. State Republican Party, 552 U.S. 442, 450-51, 128 S. Ct. 
1184, 170 L. Ed. 2d 151 (2008); see also G.E. Metzger, Facial Challenges and Federalism, 105 Colum. L. Rev. 873, 878-80 
(2005) (questioning whether the Supreme Court follows this doctrinal position in practice). We did not address this distinction in Ayotte: plaintiffs' dormant Commerce Clause challenge to the New Hampshire statute there 
was plainly identified as a facial challenge. See Ayotte, 550 F.3d at 63. Here, plaintiffs say they are not making any facial challenge. There is some question as to whether plaintiffs' pre-enforcement 
challenge can be properly characterized as an as-applied challenge.  [**37] Plaintiffs have introduced record evidence showing 
that their use or sale of opted-in Maine prescribers' identifying data occurs outside Maine and that they are ""prescription drug 
information intermediaries"" and thus potentially subject to regulation under section 1711-E(2-A). But plaintiffs argue that the law 
applies to their transactions only based on their statutory construction. We accept plaintiffs' characterization of their argument as a challenge only to section 1711-E(2-A) as it applies to plaintiffs, as 
prescription drug information intermediaries, and not as to pharmacies and other entities. See Milavetz, Gallop & Milavetz, P.A. 
v. United States, 130 S. Ct. 1324, 1339, 176 L. Ed. 2d 79 & n.7 (2010). We also assume arguendo that plaintiffs' challenge is not 
subject to the restrictions on facial challenges. But we cannot accept plaintiffs' assertion that section 1711-E(2-A) applies to their 
out-of-state transactions without engaging in our own statutory analysis. Here, the issue is not whether plaintiffs belong to a 
class of entities that section 1711-E(2-A) plainly regulates extraterritorially; it is how to interpret section 1711-E(2-A)'s intended 
scope. Cf. id. at 1339."
176,20," We do not decide whether section 1711-E(2-A) applies to pharmacies' or pharmaceutical manufacturers' out-of-state 
transactions involving opted-in Maine prescribers. There is no indication that these entities cannot effectively assert their own 
rights insofar as they are affected by section 1711-E(2-A). "
178,21," In Ayotte, this court held that the presumption against construing New Hampshire's statute to apply extraterritorially had not 
been overcome, not least because the New Hampshire Attorney General insisted that New Hampshire only sought to regulate 
conduct within its borders. 550 F.3d at 63-64."
178,22," Other states have similarly recognized that HN34[
] ""a state may have the power to legislate concerning the rights and 
obligations of its citizens with regard to transactions occurring beyond  [**45] its boundaries."" N. Alaska Salmon Co. v. Pillsbury, 
174 Cal. 1, 162 P. 93 (Cal. 1916); see also Sexton v. Ryder Truck Rental, Inc., 413 Mich. 406, 320 N.W.2d 843, 854 (Mich. 
1982); 73 Am. Jur. 2d Statutes § 250 (2010). Numerous types of state statutes have extraterritorial effect. See, e.g., State v. 
Flores, 218 Ariz. 407, 188 P.3d 706, 710 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2008) (criminal laws); Boca Petroco, Inc. v. Petroleum Realty II, LLC, 
285 Ga. 487, 678 S.E.2d 330, 333-34 (Ga. 2009) (lis pendens statutes); Heath Consultants, Inc. v. Precision Instruments, Inc., 
247 Neb. 267, 527 N.W.2d 596, 607 (Neb. 1995) (antitrust law)."
178,23," The Maine Attorney General has argued that the law regulates persons or entities over whom Maine can exercise personal 
jurisdiction. That interpretation states a limitation on any extraterritorial application of a statute: it must comport with the 
requirements of the Due Process and Full Faith and Credit Clauses. Allstate Ins. Co. v. Hague, 449 U.S. 302, 308, 101 S. Ct. 
633, 66 L. Ed. 2d 521 (1981). Plaintiffs have not argued that section 1711-E(2-A)'s application to their out-of-state transactions 
would violate those provisions. But that does not by definition alleviate constitutional concerns under the dormant Commerce 
Clause, which serves different purposes. Quill Corp. v. North Dakota, 504 U.S. 298, 312-13, 112 S. Ct. 1904, 119 L. Ed. 2d 91 
(1992). "
179,24," This limitation on states' powers is grounded in the historical origins of the Commerce Clause, which gives Congress the 
power to ""regulate Commerce . . . among the several States."" U.S. Const. Art I, § 8, cl. 3. The Framers saw this as an essential 
element of the Constitution to avoid the ""economic Balkanization"" that had prevailed under the Articles of Confederation, under 
 [**48] which states had enacted rampant tariffs and other trade barriers at the price of national economic unity. See Davis, 553 
U.S. at 337-38; Granholm v. Heald, 544 U.S. 460, 472, 125 S. Ct. 1885, 161 L. Ed. 2d 796 (2005)."
179,25," Though New Hampshire and Vermont's laws differ somewhat from Maine's, neither purports to regulate any prescriber 
anywhere."
179,26," Nor, as we discuss below, would this interpretation of section 1711-E(2-A) result in excessive burdens on interstate commerce 
relative to in-state benefits. "
180,27," Extraterritoriality has been the dormant branch of the dormant Commerce Clause. Despite a host of subsequent dormant 
Commerce Clause cases, see, e.g., Davis, 553 U.S. 328, 128 S. Ct. 1801, 170 L. Ed. 2d 685; United Haulers, 550 U.S. 330, 127 
S. Ct. 1786, 167 L. Ed. 2d 655; Am. Trucking Ass'ns, Inc. v. Mich. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 545 U.S. 429, 125 S. Ct. 2419, 162 L. 
Ed. 2d 407 (2005); Granholm, 544 U.S. 460, 125 S. Ct. 1885, 161 L. Ed. 2d 796, the Supreme Court last mentioned the doctrine 
in a paragraph of a 2003 decision to reject its applicability. The Court pointedly referred to it as ""[t]he rule that was applied in 
Baldwin and Healy,"" cases decided in 1935 and 1989. Pharm. Research & Mfrs. of Am. v. Walsh, 538 U.S. 644, 669, 123 S. Ct. 
1855, 155 L. Ed. 2d 889 (2003) (citing Healy, 491 U.S. 324, 109 S. Ct. 2491, 105 L. Ed. 2d 275; Baldwin v. G.A.F. Seelig, Inc., 
294 U.S. 511, 55 S. Ct. 497, 79 L. Ed. 1032 (1935)). We nonetheless assume this doctrine remains viable. See State Oil Co. v. 
Khan, 522 U.S. 3, 20, 118 S. Ct. 275, 139 L. Ed. 2d 199 (1997). Even so, plaintiffs' challenge fails."
180,28," Some circuits have simply framed the doctrine in terms of concerns with preventing economic protectionism or inconsistent 
regulatory regimes, see, e.g., Cloverland-Green Spring Dairies, Inc. v. Penn. Milk Mktg. Bd., 462 F.3d 249, 262-63 (3d Cir. 
2006); Pharm. Research & Mfrs. of Am. v. Concannon, 249 F.3d 66, 81-83 (1st Cir. 2001), aff'd sub nom. Pharm. Research & 
Mfrs. of Am., 538 U.S. 644, 123 S. Ct. 1855, 155 L. Ed. 2d 889, or have suggested that the Court's cases do not dictate ""the 
notion that direct and facial regulation of extraterritorial transactions is absolutely banned,"" Alliant Energy Corp. v. Bie, 336 F. 3d 
545, 547-50 (7th Cir. 2003);  [**54] see also J. Goldsmith & A. Sykes, The Internet and the Dormant Commerce Clause, 110 
Yale L.J. 785, 789-90 & n.26 (2001)."
180,29," HN44[
] Limitations on states' regulation of extraterritorial commerce have been justified because ""one State's power to 
impose burdens on the interstate market . . . is also constrained by the need to respect the interests of other States."" BMW of N. "
181,," Am. v. Gore, 517 U.S. 559, 571, 116 S. Ct. 1589, 134 L. Ed. 2d 809 (1996) (internal citation omitted); see also Healy, 491 U.S. 
at 336-37. That has never meant that states are powerless to regulate all transactions beyond their borders, including transactions involving 
their citizens. States' interests may justify extraterritorial regulation in contexts ranging from taxation under the dormant 
Commerce Clause, see, e.g., MeadWestvaco Corp. ex rel. Mead Corp. v. Ill. Dep't of Revenue, 553 U.S. 16, 24-25, 128 S. Ct. 
1498, 170 L. Ed. 2d 404 (2008), to the enforcement of criminal and tort law, see, e.g., Young v. Masci, 289 U.S. 253, 259, 53 S. 
Ct. 599, 77 L. Ed. 1158 (1933); Strassheim v. Daily, 221 U.S. 280, 285, 31 S. Ct. 558, 55 L. Ed. 735 (1911) (Holmes, J.); see 
also Bigelow v. Virginia, 421 U.S. 809, 834-35 & 834 n.2, 95 S. Ct. 2222, 44 L. Ed. 2d 600 (1975) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting). The Edgar v. MITE plurality reasoned that ""[t]he limits on a State's power to enact substantive legislation  [**55] are similar to the 
limits on the jurisdiction of state courts."" 457 U.S. at 643 (plurality opinion). But the expansion of personal jurisdiction beyond the 
rigid geographical rules of Pennoyer v. Neff, 95 U.S. 714, 24 L. Ed. 565 (1877), to the nexus-oriented approach of International 
Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 66 S. Ct. 154, 90 L. Ed. 95 (1945), only reinforces the fact that states' jurisdiction--
whether legislative or adjudicatory--is not categorically limited to their territory in any context."
181,30," The challenged price-affirmation laws were also deemed unconstitutional because they discriminated against out-of-state 
entities in favor of in-state  [**57] competitors, see Healy, 491 U.S. at 340-41; Baldwin, 294 U.S. at 522, or because of their 
protectionist effects for consumers, Brown-Forman, 476 U.S. at 580. Likewise, only a plurality in Edgar v. MITE would have 
invalidated on extraterritoriality grounds the challenged Illinois law, which required companies to obtain regulatory approval for 
takeover bids of corporations with no real relation to Illinois. See 457 U.S. at 641 (plurality opinion). The majority only invalidated 
the law as an excessive burden on interstate commerce under Pike. Id. at 142."
181,31," Baldwin involved a New York price affirmation statute that required out-of-state milk buyers to certify that they paid out-of-state 
milk producers no more than what New York producers received. See 294 U.S. at 519. The Court deemed the law an 
impermissible attempt to project New York's pricing regime on other states because it had no ""direct and certain"" relationship to 
New York's asserted interest in ensuring a supply of sanitary milk, id. at 524, and the asserted purpose of protecting local 
farmers' economic welfare was impermissibly protectionist, id. at 523. In Edgar v. MITE, the plurality found the Illinois corporate takeover bid  [**58] law had a ""sweeping extraterritorial effect"" 
because it would ""regulate a tender offer which would not affect a single Illinois shareholder"" and thus reached conduct in which 
Illinois had no conceivable interest. 457 U.S. at 642 (plurality opinion). Likewise, the price affirmation statutes in Healy and Brown-Forman were not limited to transactions involving the regulating 
state; they made in-state prices that out-of-state shippers charged for alcohol contingent on the price those shippers charged "
182,," elsewhere. See Healy, 491 U.S. at 326-27; Brown-Forman, 476 U.S. at 576. The only in-state interest served by such laws, the 
Court suggested, was to illegitimately protect local interests. See Healy, 491 U.S. at 340-41; Brown-Forman, 476 U.S. at 580."
182,32," In CTS, the Supreme Court rejected an extraterritoriality challenge to an Indiana statute limiting out-of-state tender offerors' 
acquisition of control shares in certain corporations. The Court reasoned that the law was limited ""only to corporations 
incorporated in Indiana"" with substantial numbers of shareholders in Indiana, and therefore ""every application of the Indiana Act 
will affect a substantial number of Indiana residents, whom Indiana indisputably has an interest in protecting."" 481 U.S. at 93."
182,33," This holding does not put our circuit at odds with a recent panel opinion of the Seventh Circuit. Midwest Title Loans, Inc. v. 
Mills invalidated on extraterritoriality grounds a provision of an Indiana statute that forbade lenders  [**60] that solicited or 
advertised their lending services in Indiana from making title loans to Indiana residents, unless they obtained a license from 
Indiana (and thereby agreed to be bound by Indiana's restrictions on the kind of loans permitted). See 593 F.3d 660, 662, 669 
(7th Cir. 2010). Midwest Title reasoned that states should not be allowed to control interstate commerce to prevent their citizens 
from engaging in out-of-state conduct that the regulating state (but not the citizens themselves) deems harmful. See id. at 663-
65, 666, 669. The Maine law does not raise similar concerns. It regulates only data from those Maine prescribers who have asked Maine to 
protect their data. It does not force other states to apply the regulating state's paternalistic regulatory choices even when its 
residents want to engage in prohibited conduct elsewhere."
182,34," We need not decide whether the Pike balancing test requires courts to look to the relative benefits and burdens of the statute 
as a whole or only to its effect on prescription drug information intermediaries. Plaintiffs have provided no data about range of 
prescription drug information intermediaries subject to section 1711-E(2-A) or the relative proportion of overall business 
transacted in Maine versus outside it. Plaintiffs' Pike challenge arguably fails on that basis alone; the Pike balancing test is about 
burdens on the interstate market as a whole, not about burdens on particular firms. Even looking only to the law's impact on 
plaintiffs' out-of-state  [**62] transactions, the argument fails. "
183,35," The decision in Sorrell has been appealed to the Second Circuit, and oral argument in the case (No. 09-1913) was heard on 
October 13, 2009."
183,36," Each statute operates slightly differently. The New Hampshire law imposes an outright prohibition on the sale or use of 
prescriber-identifiable data for marketing purposes. N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§ 318:47-f, 318:47-g, 318-B:12(IV) (2006). Maine's 
statute  [**65] imposes such a prohibition only for prescribers who choose to prevent their prescribing information from being 
used to market prescription drugs to them -- the so-called ""opt-out"" approach. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 22, § 1711-E(2-A). 
Vermont's law has an ""opt-in"" feature, prohibiting certain entities from selling or using prescriber-identifiable data for marketing or 
promoting prescription drugs unless the prescriber consents. Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 18, § 4631."
183,37," The Vermont statute limits the exchange of prescriber-identifiable information among the same entities as the New Hampshire 
and Maine provisions, but it also bars pharmaceutical manufacturers and marketers from using the information for marketing or 
promoting a prescription drug unless the prescriber consents. See Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 18, § 4631(d). "
184,38," The majority in this case makes the same assumption: ""Section 1711-E(2-A) does not explicitly limit detailers' use of 
prescriber-identifying data, but the earlier stages of regulation are meant to prevent this information from getting to detailers for 
use in marketing."" "
187,39," Moreover, Dr. Jerry Avorn, who also served as an expert in this case, testified in Ayotte that other approaches had been tried 
""nationally in terms of trying to restrict the freebies, trying to provide doctors with other means of learning, requiring that doctors 
take continuing ed courses,"" but that these strategies did not eliminate ""this massive distortion of what doctors are prescribing 
and what the State, and its citizens, are paying for drugs because of the very heavily and very effective promotional strategies 
that are going on out there."" 550 F.3d at 99."
187,40," I described in Ayotte some of the ways in which such messages would continue to reach prescribers: News reports, for example, would highlight  [**82] truly groundbreaking new therapies in a timely way and, indeed, 
pharmaceutical detailers with knowledge of physicians' medical specialties presumably would not need access to 
prescribing histories to effectively promote such innovations. Early adopters could be expected to respond quickly with an 
interest in trying the new medications -- effectively identifying themselves to the sales representatives. In addition, . . . the 
statute does not bar drug companies from alerting prescribers to newly discovered problems with their medications."
187,550," F.3d at 95 (footnotes omitted). Doctors also testified that they learned about new drugs from medical literature, conferences, 
and colleagues. Id. at 95 n.64 "
188,41," The district court noted that, because the Maine statute gives prescribers the option to allow use of their information, the 
pharmaceutical companies might provide incentives to prescribers in an attempt to persuade them not to opt out -- creating an 
even more troubling relationship between prescribers and drug manufacturers. Rowe, 532 F. Supp. 2d at 174 n.31; id. at 176 
n.35. In my view, such a scenario is too speculative to factor into the analysis."
188,42," The New Hampshire Attorney General urged the court to read the  [**85] act to ""'relate only to activity that takes place 
domestically,'"" and the panel majority adopted that view despite recognizing that, so construed, the law ""may not accomplish 
very much."" Ayotte, 550 F.3d at 63, 64."
188,43," Although the Attorney General at oral argument attempted to avoid committing to any specific extraterritorial reach for the 
statute, I agree with the majority that ""[t]he text of the statute by its terms shows section 1711-E(2-A) was intended to apply to 
plaintiffs' out of state use or sale of opted-in Maine prescribers' identifying data."" "
189,44," The statute also prohibits licensing or exchanging the information for value. For the sake of simplicity, I will refer primarily to 
the prohibitions on the sale or transfer of the data."
189,45," The record indicates that, other than the data from one small supplier in Maine, the prescriber-identifiable information obtained 
by the plaintiffs is transferred in the ordinary course of business from retail stores located in Maine to the pharmacy chains' out-
of-state headquarters."
189,46," An IMS senior vice president testified that the company contracts with Rite Aid at its headquarters in Pennsylvania and with 
CVS at its headquarters in Rhode Island. IMS is based in Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania."
189,47," Drug companies also have non-marketing uses for prescriber-identified data, including determining the need for new drugs 
and implementing prescription recall programs. Ayotte, 550 F.3d at 74 n.29. Still, at oral argument, plaintiffs' counsel stated that 
""[n]inety-five percent of what we do in selling to a pharmaceutical manufacturer is so that it can use the information for marketing 
 [**88] and detail."""
189,48," The district court described the ""burden on pharmacies and PDIIs to police their customers"" as follows: They can still sell the opt-out information, but they cannot do so if their customers, the pharmaceutical companies, are 
going to use the information for a purpose that the Law prohibits. If the PDIIs successfully police their contracts with the 
pharmaceutical  [**89] companies, as the Law contemplates, the pharmaceutical companies will not be able to include opt-
out prescriber information in marketing their products. If they do not, then they, not the pharmaceutical companies, are 
subject to sanction."
189,532, F. Supp. 2d at 169. 
190,49," The State argues that the record contains no evidence about the transactions between the plaintiff data miners and the drug 
manufacturers. IMS, however, asserts in its brief that none of its subscribers  [**90] are located in Maine, and it cites the 
testimony of Hossam Sadek, a senior vice president of the company, who stated that he knew of no IMS customers in the State."
190,50," Price controls that favor in-state businesses, assessments that function as protective tariffs, and regulations that cap in-state 
prices for goods produced out of state are classic examples of measures that run afoul of this aspect of the dormant Commerce 
Clause. See, e.g., Pharm. Research & Mfrs. of Am. v. Walsh, 538 U.S. 644, 669-70, 123 S. Ct. 1855, 155 L. Ed. 2d 889 (2003); 
 [**92] Or. Waste Sys., Inc. v. Dep't of Envtl. Quality, 511 U.S. 93, 99, 114 S. Ct. 1345, 128 L. Ed. 2d 13 (1994); Healy v. Beer 
Inst., Inc., 491 U.S. 324, 336, 109 S. Ct. 2491, 105 L. Ed. 2d 275 (1989). "
191,51," The Court in Pike held that, when a statute regulates evenhandedly to effectuate a legitimate local purpose, and has only 
incidental effects on interstate commerce, ""it will be upheld unless the burden imposed on such commerce is clearly excessive in 
relation to the putative local benefits."" 397 U.S. at 142."
191,52," I disagree with the majority's assertion that the plaintiffs have waived any Pike balancing argument. Given the similarity of the 
inquiries under the different strands of the dormant Commerce Clause, I see no reason to disregard the argument here."
191,53," The pursuit of such consistency is a feature of the most prominent Supreme Court extraterritoriality precedents. In Healy, 491 
U.S. at 335, the challenged Connecticut statute expressly required out-of-state shippers to affirm that their Connecticut prices 
were no higher than the prices being charged in bordering states, and the New York statute at issue  [**95] in Brown-Forman 
Distillers Corp. v. New York State Liquor Authority, 476 U.S. 573, 579, 106 S. Ct. 2080, 90 L. Ed. 2d 552 (1986), required liquor 
producers and distillers doing business in the State to affirm comparable in-state and out-of-state pricing. In Baldwin v. G.A.F. 
Seelig, Inc., 294 U.S. 511, 55 S. Ct. 497, 79 L. Ed. 1032 (1935), the Court struck down the New York Milk Control Act, which 
prescribed minimum prices for milk that had the effect of setting out-of-state milk prices. Id. at 524. In line with those cases, the 
Seventh Circuit recently struck down an Indiana law that subjected out-of-state loans entered into by Indiana residents to the 
requirements of Indiana's consumer law if the out-of-state creditor had advertised or solicited sales in Indiana. Midwest Title 
Loans, Inc. v. Mills, 593 F.3d 660, 662, 667-68 (7th Cir. 2010). "
193,54," The fact that only 259 of Maine's 7,500 prescribers opted into the statute's confidentiality protection during the period in which 
it has been suspended by the preliminary injunction tells us little about the law's likely impact. More activity presumably will occur 
once the injunction is lifted."
193,55," The ""subsidiary"" nature of the out-of-state transactions is, of course, a function of the statute's purpose to restrict speech in 
Maine. Although  [**104] that in-state speech objective strengthens the State's Commerce Clause position, the indirect 
regulatory strategy -- as I have explained -- creates the First Amendment-Commerce Clause dance and unnecessarily 
complicates the constitutional analysis."
193,56," The actual impact on the plaintiffs of legislation regulating the use of prescriber-identifiable data remains to be seen. As the 
district court noted, the law ""does not prevent the pharmaceutical  [**105] companies from marketing their products and the 
companies may resort to more general, less tailored marketing."" Rowe, 532 F. Supp. 2d at 174. It thus may be that the demand 
for aggregated data about prescribing trends will change, but not dry up. For example, the statute appears to permit detailers to 
use aggregated data based on specialities or zip codes. See Ayotte, 550 F.3d at 95 n.66. Moreover, if empirical data gathered in "
194,," the future on the statute's impact shows that less particularized, less efficient detailing is negating the cost savings Maine hopes 
to achieve, the State may be persuaded to change its approach to the problem. Cf. Clover Leaf Creamery Co., 449 U.S. at 473 
n.17 (""The existence of major in-state interests adversely affected by [a law] is a powerful safeguard against legislative abuse."")."
194,57," The district court in Sorrell observed that, ""[b]y definition, the 'Supreme Court's commercial speech doctrine . . . creates a 
category of speech defined by content but afforded only qualified protection.'"" 631 F. Supp. 2d at 447-48 (quoting Trans Union 
Corp. v. FTC, 267 F.3d 1138, 1141-42, 347 U.S. App. D.C. 376 (D.C. Cir. 2001)). "
195,58," The district court in Vermont also was faced with competing arguments about ""the nature and amount of deference"" that 
should be afforded to ""the predictive judgments and factual  [**112] findings of the Legislature."" Sorrell, 631 F. Supp. 2d at 448-
49. "
198,1," On June 3, 2009, Cloverleaf filed for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for 
this District. Cloverleaf continued in possession of its property and is operating its business as a debtor in possession, pursuant 
to the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §§ 1107 & 1108. Thereafter, Cloverleaf brought this action as an adversary proceeding 
pursuant to Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 7015. By Order of February 22, 2010, this Court granted the Motion to 
Withdraw the Reference of Adversary Proceeding to the Bankruptcy Court, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 157(d), in light of the claims 
under the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1  [**5] and 2, as well as claims relating to organizations and activities affecting interstate 
commerce."
198,2," Cloverleaf Enterprises, Inc. does business as Rosecroft Raceway, thus the terms Cloverleaf and Rosecroft are used 
interchangeably, and both refer to Plaintiff and Debtor Cloverleaf. Opp'n 5, n. 4. "
199,3," The Maryland Jockey Club and the Laurel Racing Association conduct business together and are generally referred to as the 
MJC."
199,4," Defendant TrackNet has not joined in either of the pending motions to dismiss, though it has separately moved for summary 
judgment (Paper No. 125). "
201,5," On May 8, 2009, the Circuit Court entered a final injunction, concluding that the MRC failed to provide Cloverleaf proper notice 
of a hearing and a proper hearing as required by statute. "
202,6," Cloverleaf also brings claims  [**17] for breach of contract (Count V) and injunctive relief (Count VIII) against various out-of-
state racetracks and TrackNet. Because none of these defendants joined in the pending motion to dismiss, Counts V and VIII 
need not be addressed at this point. "
204,7," Since this Court finds Cloverleaf successfully states a claim that Defendants participated in concerted activity with the host 
tracks, it need not analyze Defendants' arguments regarding the MJC's and Horsemen's ""unity of interest,"" or whether they are 
competitors. "
208,8," Cloverleaf also contends the Horsemen, Horse Breeders and MJC breached the agreement ""by actively encouraging others to 
deprive Rosecroft of simulcast signals."" Am. Compl. ¶ 90. This allegation is merely a repetition of Cloverleaf's antitrust claim, 
however. "
209,9," As explained above, in light of Cloverleaf's breach, Defendants' withdrawal of their consent by itself is not an antitrust violation. "
216,1," A broker trades on behalf of investors while a dealer trades on his own account. 15 U.S.C. § 78c(a)(4)-(5). Most securities firms 
do both and are referred to as ""broker-dealers."" "
217,2," The SEC has determined that because of the mandatory nature of this regime, core data fees should bear some relationship to 
cost. See Regulation of Market Information Fees and Revenues, Release No. 34-42208, 64 Fed. Reg. 70,613, 70,627 (Dec. 17, 
1999). To date, however, the SEC has instead approved fees based on agreement among market participants. See Concept 
Release Concerning Self-Regulation, Release No. 34-50700, 69 Fed. Reg. 71256, 71272 (Dec. 8, 2004). "
218,3," The terms ""core"" and ""non-core"" are SEC creations; the Exchange Act makes no such distinction. See Order Setting Aside 
Action by Delegated Authority and Approving Proposed Rule Change Relating to NYSE Arca Data, Release No. 34-59039, 73 
Fed. Reg. 74,770, 74,779 (Dec. 9, 2008) (Exchange Act and regulations ""do not differentiate between types of data and 
therefore apply to exchange proposals to distribute both core data and non-core data"")."
218,4," Generally speaking, a national securities exchange handles two types of orders: a ""market"" order, which is an offer to 
immediately trade at the prevailing market price on that exchange, and a ""limit"" order, which is an offer to trade a certain amount 
of a security at a specific price. A limit order that is not at a price that can be executed is added to  [***9] the exchange's ""order 
book"" at the quoted price level."
218,5," If the current best bid or offer for a security in an exchange's order book is better than or equal to the best price available 
nationally, it is necessarily reflected in the core data as the NBBO."
218,6," In fact, the SEC specifically rejected such a proposal in 2005 in order to ""allow market forces, rather than regulatory 
requirements, to determine what, if any, additional quotations outside the NBBO are displayed to investors."" Regulation NMS, 70 
Fed. Reg. at 37,567 (""Investors who need . . . more comprehensive depth-of-book information[] will be able to obtain such data 
from [securities] markets or third party vendors.""). Nor does a broker-dealer need to purchase depth-of-book data in order to 
meet its duty of best execution (which requires it to exercise reasonable diligence to obtain favorable order execution terms for 
customers) or any other statutory or regulatory requirement."
218,7," In 2001, stock prices began to be measured in one-cent increments instead of ""sixteenths,"" i.e., 1/16 of a dollar. Before 2001, 
significant depth accumulated at the NBBO price because the difference between the best price and the next inferior price was 
1/16th, or 6.25 cents. With the initiation of decimalized trading, however, the difference between those prices was reduced to 
only one cent, which substantially decreased the depth at the best prices and substantially  [***11] increased the depth at the 
various one-cent price points inferior to the best prices. "
219,8," This example is simplified because depth-of-book data reflects only displayed orders; some brokers, however, request that a 
portion of their orders be kept in reserve (i.e., not be displayed) in the exchange's order book. In addition, and due in part to the 
reserve liquidity, most trades are made at the NBBO price or better, including orders approaching 10,000 shares. See Order, 73 
Fed. Reg. at 74,792 (at least 90% of NYSE Arca's, NYSE's and NASDAQ's ""executed share volume of marketable orders were 
at prices equal to or better than the NBBO in May 2008""). Non-professional (or retail) investors' trades tend to be smaller and 
thus are especially likely to execute at the NBBO price or better. See id. at 74,793 (""This undisplayed liquidity enables retail 
investors to receive executions for most of their orders at prices equal to or better than the NBBO, regardless of the displayed 
size at the NBBO."")."
219,9," A ""non-professional subscriber"" is an end user who is a natural person and who is neither (1) registered or qualified with the 
SEC, the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, a state securities agency or a securities exchange or association, (2) 
engaged as an ""investment adviser"" under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, 15 U.S.C. §§ 80b-1 et seq. nor (3) exempt from 
a securities association registration requirement by virtue of being employed by a bank or other exempt organization. See NYSE 
Arca Application at 22.  [***14] All others, including end users that are not natural persons, are ""professional subscriber[s]."" See 
id. "
220,10," The Order does not specify why the SEC set aside its Division of Market Regulation's October 12, 2006 order other than to 
say that ""[t]he Petitioner and commenters raised a number of important issues that the Commission believes it should address 
directly at this time."" Order, 73 Fed. Reg. at 74,771. "
221,11," In contrast, another Exchange Act provision also enacted as part of the 1975 Amendment requires that the fees charged 
 [***23] as commissions be ""reasonable in relation to the costs of providing the service for which such fees are charged."" See 15 
U.S.C. § 78f(e)(1)(B) (emphasis added). In other words, the Congress knew how to tie a fee's reasonableness to its underlying 
cost but declined to do so for non-core data fees. See Catawba County, N.C. v. EPA, 571 F.3d 20, 36, 387 U.S. App. D.C. 20 
(D.C. Cir. 2009) (HN11[
] ""When interpreting statutes that govern agency action, we have consistently recognized that a 
congressional mandate in one section and silence in another often 'suggests not a prohibition but simply a decision not to 
mandate any solution in the second context, i.e., to leave the question to agency discretion.'"" (quoting Cheney R.R. Co. v. ICC, 
902 F.2d 66, 69, 284 U.S. App. D.C. 101 (D.C. Cir. 1990))). "
222,12," We have similarly held that a ""just and reasonable"" standard did not ""preclude[] the FERC from relying upon market-based 
pricing."" Elizabethtown Gas Co. v. FERC, 10 F.3d 866, 870, 304 U.S. App. D.C. 91 (D.C. Cir. 1993) As long as ""there is a 
competitive market the FERC may rely upon market-based prices in lieu of cost-of-service regulation to assure a 'just and 
reasonable' result."" Id. (quoting Tejas Power Corp. v. FERC, 908 F.2d 998, 1004, 285 U.S. App. D.C. 239 (D.C. Cir. 1990)); see 
also EarthLink, Inc. v. FCC, 462 F.3d 1, 13, 373 U.S. App. D.C. 202 (D.C. Cir. 2006)  [***27] (contrasting ""cost-based"" pricing 
required under 47 U.S.C. § 271 with ""the more relaxed 'just and reasonable' standard of 47 U.S.C. §§ 201 and 202""). "
223,13," Moreover, the Concept Release merely stated the SEC's ""belie[f] . . . that it may be possible to develop a more flexible, cost-
based approach"" that avoided cost-calculating difficulties and at the same time maintained ""a reasonable connection between 
the cost of market information and the total amount of revenues derived from market information fees."" 64 Fed. Reg. at 70,628. 
The Release, which identified itself as a ""request for comments,"" did not purport to suggest the ""belief"" as a rule. Id. at 70,613-14 
(""[T]he Commission has decided to invite public comment before taking further action. This release is intended to assist the 
public . . . by identifying a variety of specific issues . . . on which the Commission is particularly interested in receiving 
comments.""). "
226,14," Perhaps one way to resolve the apparent contradiction between asserting both the critical role of market data and at the same 
time its limited appeal to most investors is to say that the data is important but only to those ""[i]nstitutional investors that need to 
trade in large size [and] typically seek to assess market depth beyond the best prices,"" Order, 73 Fed. Reg. at 74,784,  [***44] or 
to ""algorithmic order routing services"" that use computer algorithms to determine the most profitable trading sites, id. at 74,792. 
In other words, perhaps only a minority of professional traders is interested in NYSE Arca's depth-of-book data but those few 
execute an outsized share of the total trading volume so that unreasonable fees would cause them to place their orders 
elsewhere and ultimately affect order flow. But if this is the SEC's theory, it is not supported by evidence of the traders using 
NYSE Arca's depth-of-book data or of the percentage of total trading volume those traders may generate. "
227,15," In fact, the Advisory Committee disagreed over whether competitive forces would ensure that market data fees remain ""fair 
and reasonable."" While some Committee members were ""concern[ed] that the rise of publicly-held for-profit exchanges, and 
their obligation to maximize shareholder value, will put upward pressure on market data fees,"" others argued that the exchanges' 
inclination to increase data fees ""will be checked by the need to make data available to generate order flow and attract listings."" 
Advisory Committee Report § D.3.d. The Report did not resolve the disagreement but  [***45] rather cautioned that ""the 
Commission may want to be more vigilant in assuring that a for-profit SRO's market data fees meet the statutory 'fair and 
reasonable' standard."" Id."
227,16," The SEC points to a NASDAQ-commissioned economic study described in the Order which employs the ""total platform"" theory 
whereby market data  [***46] and trade executions are ""joint products"" with ""joint costs"" at each trading ""platform,"" or exchange. 
Resp't's Br. 43-44; see Order, 73 Fed. Reg. at 74,779. Although an exchange may price its trade execution fees higher and its 
market data fees lower (or vice versa), because of ""platform"" competition the exchange nonetheless receives the same return 
from the two ""joint products"" in the aggregate. But this is not the theory of competition the SEC relied on below and it may not 
press it for the first time on appeal. See BNSF Ry. Co. v. Surface Transp. Bd., 604 F.3d 602, 613, 390 U.S. App. D.C. 294 (D.C. 
Cir. 2010) (citing SEC v. Chenery Corp., 332 U.S. 194, 196, 67 S. Ct. 1575, 91 L. Ed. 1995 (1947)). "
228,17," We also know that as of July 2008, about 15% of ISE members--20 of 140-- subscribe to its depth-of-book product even 
though it is free. See Order, 73 Fed. Reg. at 74,779;  [***50] Comment Letter of Michael J. Simon, Secretary, International Stock 
Exchange, at 2 (July 10, 2008). Given that ISE's share volume in U.S. listed stocks is significantly smaller than that of NYSE 
Arca (.9% compared to 16.5% during June 2008), it is no surprise that its market data is less in demand. See 73 Fed. Reg. at 
74,784 (depth-of-book data provided by exchanges and ECNs with greater trading volume ""will be proportionally more important 
in assessing market depth"" and thus ""smaller exchanges may well be inclined to offer their data for no charge or low fees as a 
means to attract order flow""). "

240,5," This  [***8] appeal challenges the judgment rendered following the consolidation of two separately filed matters in the trial 
court. Although Brown and Brown, Inc., is the plaintiff only in the first matter for declaratory and injunctive relief, and is the 
defendant in the second matter brought by the attorney general to enforce compliance with a subpoena; see General Statutes § 
35-42 (f) (1); for convenience we refer to Brown and Brown, Inc., as the plaintiff and to the attorney general as the defendant."
240,6," On May 6, 2009, the Connecticut Business and Industry Association, Inc., the Insurance Association of Connecticut, the 
National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies, the American Insurance Association and the Property Casualty Insurers 
Association of America, collectively, filed an application to appear as amicus curiae and requested permission to file a brief in 
this matter and to participate in oral argument. Additionally, on May 11, 2009, the New England Legal Foundation filed an 
application to appear as amicus curiae and requested permission to file a brief. On June 3, 2009, this court granted both 
applications, but ordered that no oral argument would be permitted."
240,7," The plaintiff also  [***9] claims that the trial court, as to the § 35-42 (f) (1) enforcement proceedings, improperly ordered the 
plaintiff to comply unconditionally with the defendant's subpoena and, additionally, improperly granted the defendant's motion to 
delete or expunge an answer and special defenses filed by the plaintiff, because those proceedings are civil actions to which the 
rules of practice apply. In light of our resolution of the plaintiff's first claim, we need not discuss the second claim in any detail. In 
short, because the trial court's order of compliance was premised on its misinterpretation of the confidentiality provisions of § 35-
42, it necessarily was improper and must be reversed. In light of our resolution of the plaintiff's second claim, we need not reach 
its third claim, because resolution of that claim in the plaintiff's favor would afford it no practical relief. "
241,8," Counsel for the plaintiff attested, in an affidavit submitted to the trial court, that the defendant had requested production of, inter 
alia, ""detailed internal financial records, customer lists, business strategies, internal negotiation strategies, and internal self-
evaluations of its business activities and procedures."""
241,9," Section 35-42 (e) (1), which authorizes the defendant to subpoena oral testimony, similarly provides that transcripts of such 
testimony ""shall not be available for public disclosure . . . ."" Moreover, § 35-42 recently was amended by Public Acts 2009, No. 
09-68, to address the subject of documentary material or other information voluntarily furnished to the defendant in connection 
with an antitrust investigation. The amendment uses language identical to the existing provisions covering material or 
information gained by subpoena and, therefore, it appears that the legislature intends to afford all of the different categories of 
material and information the same level of confidentiality. Specifically, pursuant to subsection (c) (2) of the amended statute, 
voluntarily produced material or information, as well as the identity of its provider, ""shall be held in the custody of the Attorney 
General, or the Attorney General's designee, and shall not be available to the public."" (Emphasis added.) General Statutes (Sup. 
2010) § 35-42 (c) (2)."
241,10," In additional counts of its complaint, the plaintiff also sought temporary and permanent injunctive relief barring the defendant 
from disclosing the responsive material and information in violation of the provisions of § 35-42. The complaint also included 
counts,  [***13] pleaded in the alternative, seeking: a writ of mandamus requiring the defendant to protect the confidentiality of 
the responsive material and information by not disclosing it in violation of § 35-42; an order quashing the subpoena or modifying 
it to provide safeguards to prevent the disclosure of the plaintiff's trade secrets and other confidential information; and a 
protective order preventing the defendant from disclosing those trade secrets and other confidential information. The trial court 
viewed each count of the plaintiff's complaint as raising the same legal issue, namely, the proper construction of § 35-42. 
Because we agree with that characterization, we need not consider separately the claims raised by the plaintiff."
241,11," The trial court held the defendant's application for an order of compliance in abeyance pending the resolution of the plaintiff's 
motion for summary judgment. "
242,12," As an initial matter, the trial court rejected the plaintiff's claim that the defendant was precluded by the doctrine of collateral 
estoppel from arguing that the meaning of § 35-42 differed from the interpretation of the statute reached in Mobil Oil Corp. v. 
Killian, 30 Conn. Sup. 87, 301 A.2d 562 (1973), because his office was a party to that action and did not challenge the court's 
holding by way of appeal. According to the trial court, the statutory interpretation in Mobil Oil Corp. was dicta and, therefore, the 
meaning of § 35-42 was not necessarily determined for purposes  [***17] of preclusion. The trial court noted additionally that the 
holding of Mobil Oil Corp. was overruled legislatively by the amendment of § 35-42. See Public Acts 1973, No. 73-668. Although 
we agree with the trial court that the doctrine of collateral estoppel does not apply to bar the defendant from relitigating the 
meaning of § 35-42, we do so on different reasoning. Specifically, we recently held that, for important policy reasons, HN5[
] 
nonmutual collateral estoppel cannot be employed offensively against a government entity as it may in an action between private 
parties. See Sikorsky Aircraft Corp. v. Commissioner of Revenue Services, 297 Conn. 540, 546, ___ A.2d ___, 1 A.3d 1033 
(2010); see also United States v. Mendoza, 464 U.S. 154, 159-60, 104 S. Ct. 568, 78 L. Ed. 2d 379 (1984)."

investigations of abuse of elderly persons ""shall not be deemed public records nor be subject to the provisions of section 1-

purposes of the Freedom of Information Act, as defined in section 1-200"")."
245,16," Although the defendant suggested at oral argument that the legislature's method of explicit cross-referencing differed prior to 
the enactment of the Freedom of Information Act, he has not provided any authority supporting that proposition. "
246,17," HN14[
] As a general matter, we interpret the antitrust act with reference to the federal courts' interpretation of federal 
antitrust law. Vacco v. Microsoft Corp., supra, 260 Conn. 72-73; Westport Taxi Service, Inc. v. Westport Transit District, supra, 
235 Conn. 15 n.17; see also General Statutes § 35-44b. Nevertheless, we may disregard federal precedent when the statutes at 
issue differ materially in their terms. See State v. Marsh & McLennan Cos., supra, 286 Conn. 470 (Connecticut courts need not 
incorporate federal antitrust law into state antitrust jurisprudence where state statute and federal counterpart differ significantly); 
Miller's Pond Co., LLC v. New London, 273 Conn. 786, 811, 873 A.2d 965 (2005) (§ 35-44b inapplicable in case that concerned 
state antitrust statute having no federal counterpart); Westport Taxi Service, Inc. v. Westport Transit District, supra, 15-16 (""we 
follow federal precedent when we interpret the [antitrust] act unless the text of our antitrust statutes, or other pertinent state law, 
requires us to interpret it differently""). "
247,18," We acknowledge that the trial court's holding in Mobil Oil Corp., to the extent that it went beyond the issue presented, namely, 
whether the defendant could share subpoenaed documents with other government officials, was dicta. We see no reason, 
however, why the legislature, if it perceived any peripheral aspect of the court's decision to be a misinterpretation of § 35-42, 
would have declined to correct a misinterpretation as part of the amendment responding to the direct holding of the case."
247,19," HN17[
] Pursuant to § 35-42, investigatory materials may be held or solicited by either the attorney general or his designees. We read the latter term to include experts retained by the attorney general or others authorized to act on his behalf in conducting 
antitrust investigations. Cf. Tesoro Petroleum Corp. v. State, 42 P.3d 531, 535-39 (Alaska 2002) (outside counsel was both "" 
'authorized employee' "" and attorney general's "" '[d]esignee' "" for purpose of statute authorizing civil investigative demands for 
suspected antitrust violations). At oral argument, the plaintiff agreed that the term ""designee"" encompassed outside counsel and 
expert witnesses."
247,20," Practice Book § 7-4B provides: HN19[
] ""(a) As used in this section, 'record' means any affidavit, document, or other 
material. ""(b) A party filing a motion requesting that a record be filed under seal or that its disclosure be limited shall lodge the record with 
the court pursuant to Section 7-4C when the motion is filed, unless the judicial authority, for good cause shown,  [***41] orders "
248,," that the record need not be lodged. The motion must be accompanied by an appropriate memorandum of law to justify the 
sealing or limited disclosure. ""(c) If necessary to prevent disclosure, the motion, any objection thereto, and any supporting records must be filed in a public 
redacted version and lodged in a nonredacted version conditionally under seal. ""(d) If the judicial authority denies the motion to seal or to limit disclosure, the clerk shall either (1) return the lodged record to the 
submitting party and shall not place it in the court file or (2) upon written request of the submitting party retain the record as a 
lodged record so that in the event the submitting party appeals the denial of the motion, the lodged record can be part of the 
record on appeal of the final judgment in the case. In the latter event or if the judicial authority grants the motion, the clerk shall 
follow the procedure set forth in Section 7-4C (e). If the lodged record is retained pursuant to (2) above, the clerk shall return it to 
the submitting party or destroy it upon the expiration of the appeal period if no appeal has been filed."""
248,21," Practice Book § 7-4C provides: HN20[
] ""(a) A 'lodged' record is a  [***42] record that is temporarily placed or deposited with 
the court but not filed. ""(b) A party who moves to file a record under seal or to limit its disclosure shall put the record in a manila envelope or other 
appropriate container, seal the envelope or container, and lodge it with the court. ""(c) The party submitting the lodged record must affix to the envelope or container a cover sheet that contains the case caption 
and docket number, the words 'Conditionally Under Seal,' the name of the party submitting the record and a statement that the 
enclosed record is subject to a motion to file the record under seal. ""(d) Upon receipt of a record lodged under this section, the clerk shall note on the affixed cover sheet the date of its receipt and 
shall retain but not file the record unless the court orders it filed. ""(e) If the judicial authority grants the motion to seal the record or to limit its disclosure, the clerk shall prominently place on the 
envelope or container the words 'SEALED BY ORDER OF THE COURT ON (DATE)' or 'DISCLOSURE LIMITED BY ORDER 
OF THE COURT ON (DATE),' as appropriate, and shall affix to the envelope or container a copy of the court's order and the 
public redacted version  [***43] of the motion. If the judicial authority denies the motion and the submitting party requests in 
writing that the record be retained as a lodged record, the clerk shall prominently place on the envelope or container the words 
'MOTION DENIED, RETAIN AS LODGED RECORD' and shall affix to the envelope or container a copy of the court's order and 
the public redacted version of the motion."""
248,22," A manual used internally by the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice provides that, ""[a]lthough it is 
occasionally useful to use [civil investigatory demand] materials in a deposition of a third party where the third party has already 
seen the materials, or is at least generally aware of their substance, it is very rarely necessary to use [those] materials in 
connection with a deposition of a third party that is unfamiliar with the contents  [***45] of those materials."" Dept. of Justice, 
Antitrust Division Manual (4th Ed. 2008) c. III, pp. III-68 through III-69. Additionally, the assistant attorney general in the present 
case acknowledged, when he attempted to negotiate with the plaintiff the terms to govern its compliance with the defendant's 
subpoena, that disclosure of subpoenaed material when deposing third party witnesses is necessary only ""[i]n very rare 
instances . . . ."" "
249,23," Although the defendant has expressed concern over an interpretation of § 35-42 that would constrain his ability to reference 
subpoenaed materials in a complaint, we question whether that concern is warranted. Connecticut employs fact pleading, which 
requires that a ""pleading shall contain a plain and concise statement of the material facts on which the pleader relies, but not of 
the evidence by which they are to be proved . . . ."" Practice Book § 10-1. In accordance  [***49] with this provision, ""[a]ttorneys in 
Connecticut are not required, at the time a pleading is filed, to substantiate the allegations contained therein with evidentiary 
support."" Brunswick v. Statewide Grievance Committee, 103 Conn. App. 601, 617, 931 A.2d 319, cert. denied, 284 Conn. 929, 
934 A.2d 244 (2007). To the contrary, inclusion of evidence in a complaint is a violation of our rules of practice. Fort Trumbull 
Conservancy, LLC v. Alves, 286 Conn. 264, 277 n.13, 943 A.2d 420 (2008)."
249,24," If the materials are obtained from a nonparty, the nonparty must be given notice that the materials have been lodged with the 
court so that it has an opportunity to intervene and contest their disclosure to the extent that it believes is warranted. See, e.g., 
Rosado v. Bridgeport Roman Catholic Diocesan Corp., supra, 292 Conn. 5 n.1 (nonparty individuals permitted to intervene for 
limited purpose of contesting disclosure of documents)."
249,25," Practice Book § 11-20A (c) provides: HN23[
] ""Upon written motion of any party, or upon its own motion, the judicial authority 
may order that files, affidavits, documents, or other materials on file or lodged with the court or in connection with a court 
proceeding be sealed  [***50] or their disclosure limited only if the judicial authority concludes that such order is necessary to 
preserve an interest which is determined to override the public's interest in viewing such materials. The judicial authority shall "
250,," first consider reasonable alternatives to any such order and any such order shall be no broader than necessary to protect such 
overriding interest. An agreement of the parties to seal or limit the disclosure of documents on file with the court or filed in 
connection with a court proceeding shall not constitute a sufficient basis for the issuance of such an order."""
250,26," We recognize that our rules of practice presume that the party lodging records with the trial court necessarily is the same party 
who wishes to have the records sealed or their disclosure limited. As a practical matter, however, we also recognize that the 
lodging party, at times, will be seeking disclosure of records that earlier were deemed confidential. In such circumstances, 
requiring lodging of the records in a manner consistent with the procedures set forth in Practice Book §§ 7-4B and 7-4C will 
ensure that the records remain confidential until the court can enter an order pursuant to Practice Book § 11-20A (c). "
254,1," See, e.g., Xcaliber Int'l Ltd. LLC v. Caldwell, No. 09-30492, 612 F.3d 368, 2010 U.S. App. LEXIS 14513 (5th Cir. Jul. 15, 2010);

255,2," The specific parties in this case include a cigarette manufacturer who has not joined 2 the MSA, i.e. an NPM (S & M Brands, 
Inc.), a cigarette dealer (Tobacco Discount House # 1), and a smoker (Mark Heacock) (collectively, ""the plaintiffs""). "
257,3," In Xcaliber, the plaintiff challenged the Allocable Share Revocation (""ASR""). The ASR 3 was an amendment that Louisiana, 
and all Settling States, passed to the original escrow statutes in order to close a loophole in the original escrow statutes that was 
advantageous to NPMs. See 612 F.3d 368, 2010 U.S. App. LEXIS 14513, at *6-7 (discussing the reason for the ASR). The 
Louisiana Escrow Statute considered in the plaintiffs' instant challenge incorporates the alteration of the ASR. "
266,1, The document numbers referenced in this Opinion are the document numbers assigned in case No. 2:09-cv-172. 
271,2," There has been no suggestion in this matter of predatory pricing. Plaintiff simply alleges that the pricing was ""unreasonably 
low"" because he could have charged more."
271,3," HN17[
] Although the terms ""relevant market"" and ""antitrust injury"" are separate concepts, and are thus typically analyzed 
independently, see, e.g., Worldwide Basketball & Sport Tours, Inc. v. NCAA, 388 F.3d 955, 963-64 (6th Cir. 2004), the Court 
notes that they are ""intertwined"" in application. See Mathias v. Daily News, L.P., 152 F. Supp. 2d 465, 480 (S.D.N.Y.) (noting 
that the ""requirement of pleading a relevant market is closely intertwined with the element of antitrust injury"" as ""[a] 
 [**24] complaint must allege a relevant product market in which the anticompetitive effects of the challenged activity can be "
272,," assessed."") (Citation omitted). Furthermore, Plaintiff has not alleged a group boycott that would require a per se approach. In 
limited circumstances, a group boycott can constitute a per se violation. See FTC v. Indiana Federation of Dentists, 476 U.S. 
447, 459, 106 S. Ct. 2009, 90 L. Ed. 2d 445 (1986) (""the per se approach has generally been limited to cases in which firms with 
market power boycott suppliers or customers in order to discourage them from doing business with a competitor""). But this 
approach is not appropriate here because the exercise of ""market power"" by Defendants' cannot be inferred from the facts 
alleged."
272,4," In response to Defendants' motion to dismiss, Plaintiff asserts that dogs are not commodities, and therefore antitrust claims 
relating to them should not be analyzed as such. Plaintiff's position is unsupportable, as HN19[
] dogs are regarded as the 
property of its owner under Ohio law. See, e.g., Strawser v. Wright, 80 Ohio App. 3d 751, 610 N.E.2d 610 (Ohio Ct. App. 1992) 
(citing Hill v. Micham, 116 Ohio St. 549, 5 Ohio Law Abs. 76, 5 Ohio Law Abs. 330, 157 N.E. 13, 25 Ohio L. Rep. 337 (Ohio 
1927)). "
275,5," To the extent Plaintiff was seeking to assert a fraud claim in the Antitrust Action based on the same conduct alleged in the 
Lanham Act Action, the Court notes that, because the fraud claim in the Lanham Act Action remains pending, Plaintiff may 
continue to seek damages for the alleged conduct notwithstanding the dismissal of the fraud claim in the Antitrust Action. "

285,4," Various subsidiaries of CBIZ, Inc. were associated with Bertram Vallez as well as MHM. For ease of discussion, we collectively

285,5," In general, an APS is an accounting firm divided into two separate entities, a professional corporation and a business corporation, separating the attest function 
activities from the business services  [**4] (such as consulting, financial planning, tax compliance and planning, and other 
business advisory services). . . . The accounting firm (professional corporation) performs all attest functions, including 
audits, reviews and compilations. It is 100% owned by certified public accountants and is managed by a ""managing 
member,"" who is also a CPA. The owners of the CPA firm are employees of the CPA firm (as well as the business services 
company) and the rest of the personnel are employees of the business services company. There is a long-term 
administrative services agreement between the two, stipulating that support and personnel staff are made available to the 
CPA firm by the business services company. The latter also provides office space, equipment and recordkeeping for the 
CPA firm. "
286,," James D. Campbell, Alternative Practice Structures, Penn. CPA J. 10, 10-11 (Winter 1999)."
286,6," ""Attest services are required to be performed by a licensed CPA or licensed CPA firm."" (Trial Tr. vol. II, 215.) In most states, 
this includes audits and reviews. (See id.)"
286,7," Nonattest services do not require a CPA and include ""tax work and consulting services."" (Trial Tr. vol. II, 215-16.)"
286,8," Although each appellant executed a separate Stockholder's Agreement, the agreements are identical such that we collectively 
refer to all of them as the ""Stockholder's Agreement."""
286,9," The Stockholder's Agreement does not specifically define ""Post-Employment Restrictive Period"" but describes it, as relevant 
here, as ""the post employment period during which the non-competition provision of the Shareholders' Executive Employment 
Agreement or other contractual arrangements with [CBIZ] applies."" (Appellants' Add. 56-57.) The ""Restrictive Period"" under the 
Confidentiality Agreements Krier, Stelzer, and Walter had with CBIZ was two years. Thus, their ""Post-Employment Restrictive 
Period"" under the Stockholder's Agreement was also two years. The ""Restriction Period"" in Barton's 1998 Executive 
Employment Agreement with CBIZ was five years. It follows that Barton's ""Post Employment Restrictive Period"" under the 
Stockholder's Agreement would also be five years. However, the district court found ""that MHM represented at trial that it would 
only seek enforcement of Mr. Barton's restrictive covenant for two years and that the logistics of policing the agreement of "
287,," varying lengths between partners of the same firm warrants enforcement of Barton's covenant for two years rather than five."" 
Mayer Hoffman McCann, P.C. v. Barton, No. 4:08-CV-00574-GAF, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27559, 2009 WL 900741, at *4 (W.D. 
Mo. Apr. 1, 2009) [**10]  (unpublished). MHM does not challenge this factual finding on appeal and, thus, has waived any 
argument to the contrary. See Freeman v. Ferguson, 911 F.2d 52, 56 (8th Cir. 1990) (""It is well settled in this circuit HN1[
] if 
an issue is not raised on appeal it will be deemed abandoned."" (quotation omitted)). Therefore, for purposes of this appeal, 
Barton's ""Post-Employment Restrictive Period"" was two years."
287,10," The Stockholder's Agreement defines ""confidential information"" as all information or knowledge belonging to, used by, or which is in the possession of [MHM] relating to [MHM's] business, 
 [**11] business plans, strategies, pricing, sales methods, customers . . . , technology, programs, finances, costs, 
employees (including without limitation, the names, addresses or telephone numbers of any employees), employee 
compensation rates or policies, marketing plans, development plans, computer programs, computer systems, inventions, 
developments, trade secrets, know how or confidences of [MHM] or [MHM's] business, without regard to whether any of 
such Confidential Information may be deemed confidential or material to any third party, and [MHM] and the Shareholder 
hereby stipulate to the confidentiality and materiality of all such Confidential Information. (Appellants' Add. 57.)"
287,11," Within a few weeks of appellants' departure, MHM did combine its New Hope office with its Minneapolis office. "
288,12," MHM has (1) made a down payment on the amount owed and (2) executed notes payable to each of the appellants for the 
remainder to be paid as provided by the Stockholder's Agreement."
288,13," The complaint  [**14] also alleged a Count IV, but, as MHM has not pursued it, we do not address it. See Barton, 2009 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 27559, 2009 WL 900741, at *14 n.3."
288,14," Pursuant to the Stockholder's Agreement, appellants agreed that, upon their termination, they would (1) ""return promptly to 
[MHM] all memoranda, notes, records, reports, manuals, pricing lists, prints and other documents (and all copies thereof) 
relating to [MHM's] business . . . regardless [of] whether any such documents constitute Confidential Information"" and (2) 
""forward to [MHM] all Confidential Information,"" including such information acquired after their termination. (Appellants' Add. 58.)"
288,15, This was revealed by a computer forensic search after this litigation began.
288,16," To manage its files, MHM uses ""Caseware,"" a commercial software product that has been tailored considerably for MHM. "
289,17," Mark Lanterman, Chief Technology Officer for Computer Forensic Services, Inc. (""CFS""), conducted a computer forensic 
search of BWK's server and computers, applying the search terms agreed upon by the parties, and located approximately 1,500 
files and 64,000 emails containing one or more of the search terms."
289,18," From August 1, 2006, through July 31, 2007, MHM's gross fee billings for the solicited clients totaled $ 692,905. From August 
1, 2007, through July 31, 2008, MHM's gross fee billings for the solicited clients totaled $ 672,859. BWK's billings for one 
""Qualified Prospective  [**18] Customer,"" defined by the Stockholder's Agreement as ""any person, organization or other entity to 
which [MHM] . . . submitted a proposal for attest services at any time during the twelve-month period prior to the termination of 
[appellants'] employment[,]"" (Appellants' Add. 56), were $ 4,158. We note that, although these amounts total $ 1,369,922, MHM 
sought $ 1,369,921, and the record is silent as to the reason for this one dollar-difference. "
290,19," HN8[
] ""[C]ourts do not [ordinarily] inquire into the adequacy of consideration."" Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 79(c); 
see id. § 79(f) (noting the Restatement's rejection of ""any supposed requirement of 'mutuality of obligation'""). Although Missouri 
has adopted the Restatement approach, see Valentine's, Inc. v. Ngo, 251 S.W.3d 352, 354 (Mo. Ct. App. 2008), see also State 
ex rel. Vincent v. Schneider, 194 S.W.3d 853, 859 (Mo. 2006) (""As long as the requirement of consideration is met, mutuality of 
obligation is present, even if one party is more obligated than the other."" (quotation omitted)), even recent Missouri cases 
continue to recite mutuality of obligation as a prerequisite to an enforceable contract, see, e.g., Birkenmeier v. Keller Biomedical, 
LLC, 312 S.W.3d 380, 392, 2010 WL 1555227, at *9 (Mo. Ct. App. Apr. 20, 2010).  [**23] We further note that Missouri law 
provides that ""[t]he ordinary rules of contractual construction and enforcement are not necessarily applicable to . . . agreements"" 
containing noncompete clauses. See AEE-EMF, Inc. v. Passmore, 906 S.W.2d 714, 719 (Mo. Ct. App. 1995). Because we are to 
apply Missouri law, see Praetorian, 604 F.3d at 515, and Sturgis inquires into the adequacy of consideration given by an 
employer in exchange for an employee's covenant not to compete, see 930 S.W.2d at 17, we do so here. "
291,20," Although we are bound to apply Sturgis, see Am. Family Mut. Ins. Co. v. Co Fat Le, 439 F.3d 436, 439 (8th Cir. 2006) (HN11[ ] ""[W]e are bound in our construction of Missouri law by the decisions of the Missouri courts.""), we note that MHM's promise to 
buy back appellants' stock in MHM was beneficial to appellants. HN12[
] ""Only  [**26] licensed professionals who are 
employed by the professional corporation may be shareholders or directors. In addition, shares can only be transferred to other 
individuals licensed to practice in the same profession."" 1A William Meade Fletcher, Fletcher Cyclopedia of the Law of Private 
Corporations § 70.10 (perm. ed., rev. ed. 2002). Thus, there is no ready market for the sale of shares of a professional 
corporation's stock. See id. Accordingly, ""[i]f a buyback is not provided, a minority shareholder who resigns from or is forced out 
as an employee of a professional corporation is in a difficult position, absent a protective shareholders' agreement."" 1 F. Hodge 
O'Neal, Robert B. Thompson, & Blake Thompson, O'Neal and Thompson's Close Corporations and LLCs: Law and Practice § 
2.9 (rev. 3d ed. 2004)."
291,21," A later Missouri Court of Appeals decision has explained that ""[t]he essence of the [Sturgis] holding is that the evidence did not 
support a finding of knowledge of trade secrets or of customer contact sufficient to support a restrictive covenant, and so did not 
justify any kind of restriction."" Alltype Fire Prot. Co. v. Mayfield, 88 S.W.3d 120, 123-24 (Mo. Ct. App. 2002). "
294,22," We note that, contrary to the district court's determination that appellants breached the restrictive covenant by soliciting MHM's 
employees (Count II), MHM had no protectable interest in its employees. See McHugh, 28 S.W.3d at 347, 349-51 (holding that 
HN20[
] Missouri law does not allow covenants not to solicit former coworkers as such covenants are ""in restraint of trade"" in 
that they ""restrict [] the flow of competitive information about the labor market, including the availability of opportunities and offers 
of employment to an employer's at-will workforce""). Because MHM was awarded no damages stemming from Count II, our 
determination has no impact  [**36] on the damage award in this case."
294,23," The appellants do not argue that the restrictive covenants themselves violate antitrust laws. See McDonald v. Johnson & 
Johnson, 722 F.2d 1370, 1378 (8th Cir. 1983) (HN25[
] ""[C]ovenants not to compete generally are not violative of the antitrust

deciding whether the provision is to be considered liquidated damages or a penalty."" Diffley v. Royal Papers, Inc., 948 S.W.2d "
296,244," , 247 (Mo. Ct. App. 1997). Thus, the fact that the clause at issue is entitled ""Liquidated Damages"" at least supports a 
determination that it is not an invalid penalty clause."
296,26," Although it appears that the language in Barton's Executive Agreement (the only appellant  [**44] who had such an 
agreement) contained a different measure for liquidated damages, appellants do not raise this issue on appeal. Therefore, we do 
not address it. See Freeman, 911 F.2d at 56. "
312,1," This statement paraphrases the description of the proposed plaintiff classes given by the District Court. See In re Ins. 
Brokerage Antitrust Litig., 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 73220, 2007 WL 2892700, at *2 (D.N.J. Sept. 28, 2007). The complaints, 
however, arguably define the proposed classes to include not only those persons or entities who bought insurance from a 
defendant insurer through a defendant broker, but also those persons or entities who bought insurance from any insurer through 
a defendant broker. See Commercial Case Second Amended Complaint (Comm. SAC) P 555; Employee Benefits Case Second 
Amended Complaint (EB SAC) P 585. This discrepancy is not relevant to our disposition of this appeal."
312,2," In the Employee Benefits Case only, plaintiffs also brought claims under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 
(ERISA), 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(2), alleging defendants had breached fiduciary duties imposed by the statute. These claims are 
not before us. See infra note 3. "
313,3," The District Court exercised jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1367. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291. The 
Sherman Act and RICO claims were the only federal causes of action asserted in the Commercial complaint. Having dismissed 
both claims in its August 31 and September 28 opinions, the District Court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over 
the remaining state-law claims and dismissed the Commercial complaint in its entirety. 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 73220, 2007 WL 
2892700, at *34; see  [**16] 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c). The Employee Benefits complaint also included claims that the insurer 
defendants had breached their fiduciary duties under ERISA. The District Court subsequently disposed of these ERISA claims 
when it granted defendants' motion for summary judgment, In re Ins. Brokerage Antitrust Litig., 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2818, 
2008 WL 141498 (D.N.J. Jan. 14, 2008), after which it declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state-law claims 
and dismissed the Employee Benefits complaint in its entirety, In re Ins. Brokerage Antitrust Litig., No. 05-1079 (D.N.J. Feb. 13, 
2008). Although plaintiffs originally appealed the District Court's summary judgment order regarding the ERISA claims, they expressly 
waived that issue in their opening brief. Plaintiffs' Employee Benefits (EB) Br. 10. "
314,4," While this appeal was pending, the District Court approved a settlement agreement between the plaintiffs and the Marsh 
Defendants. (In the Commercial Case, the Marsh Defendants comprise Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc.; Marsh Inc.; Marsh 
USA, Inc.; Marsh USA Inc. (Connecticut); and Seabury & Smith, Inc. In the Employee Benefits Case, the Marsh Defendants

314,6," The defendant-broker names given here encompass related and/or subsidiary companies, as detailed in Comm. SAC PP 24-36 
and EB SAC PP 34-45. The names of the defendant insurers allegedly conspiring with each broker can also be found in the 
complaints; in the interest of brevity, we will not reproduce them here. See Comm. SAC PP 95, 157, 201, 236, 262, 326; EB 
SAC PP 106, 139, 175, 239, 271. The number of insurers in each alleged broker-centered conspiracy ranges from three to 
thirteen. (These numbers refer to parent entities and do not include the subsidiary/related companies also named as defendants. 
See Comm. SAC PP 37-63 (listing subsidiary/related insurers in the Commercial Case); EB SAC PP 46-57 (listing 
subsidiary/related insurers in the Employee Benefits Case).)"
314,7," The quoted language is drawn from the description of the Aon-centered conspiracy in the Commercial complaint but is 
generally applicable to all of the alleged broker-centered conspiracies. See Comm. SAC PP 66-67; EB SAC PP 76-77."
314,8," Plaintiffs do not specifically define these terms, but from context we infer that a ""last look"" affords a bidder the ability to make 
the final bid with knowledge of all previous bids, and a ""first look"" allows a bidder the opportunity to bid without competition (for 
example, guaranteeing a sale to the bidder if it can  [**22] match a certain price). "
316,9," In addition to the following two requirements, the plaintiffs in any antitrust case ""must prove antitrust injury, which is to say (1) 
injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and (2) that flows from that which makes defendants' acts unlawful.""

317,10," ""Congress used th[e] distinction between concerted and independent action to deter anticompetitive conduct and compensate 
its  [**30] victims, without chilling vigorous competition through ordinary business operations. . . . [U]nlike independent action,

question whether it unreasonably restrains trade."" Am. Needle, 130 S. Ct. at 2206."
317,12," In the event a genuinely 12 disputed issue of fact exists regarding the reasonableness  [**33] of the restraint, the 
determination is for the jury. See Arizona v. Maricopa County Med. Soc'y, 457 U.S. 332, 343, 102 S. Ct. 2466, 73 L. Ed. 2d 48 
(1982) (""[T]he rule of reason requires the factfinder to decide whether under all the circumstances of the case the restrictive

(""[O]nce the court decide[s] that the rule of reason should apply, disputed factual questions about reasonableness should be left 
to the jury.""). "
318,13," When evaluating tying arrangements, in which a firm ""sell[s] one good (the tying product) on the condition that the buyer also 
purchase another, separate good (the tied product),"" Town Sound & Custom Tops, Inc. v. Chrysler Motors Corp., 959 F.2d 468, 
475 (3d Cir. 1992) (en banc), courts have applied a modified version of the per se standard. Unlike the ""truly per se rules"" 
explicated above, in which no inquiry is made into market structure, actual anticompetitive effects, or possible justifications, ""[t]he 
'per se' rule against tying goes only halfway . . .: the inquiry into tying product market structure . . . is still required, but if the 
defendant is found to have market power there, the plaintiff is, in theory, relieved of proving actual harm to competition and of 
rebutting justifications for the tie-in."" Id. at 477; see U.S. Healthcare, Inc. v. Healthsource, Inc., 986 F.2d 589, 593 n.2 (1st Cir. 
1993) (stating that tying  [**36] might better be described as a ""quasi"" per se offense, ""since some element of [market] power 
must be shown and defenses are effectively available"") (citing Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Technical Servs., Inc., 504 U.S.

different meanings of ""per se"" language in antitrust jurisprudence). "
319,14," As the above discussion ought to make clear, the respective analyses conducted under the rule of reason, per se, and quick 
look standards are not categorically different. In every case, ""the essential inquiry"" is ""whether or not the challenged restraint 
enhances competition."" Cal. Dental, 526 U.S. at 780 (internal quotation marks omitted). Under a traditional rule-of-reason 
analysis, a court requires ""actual market analysis,"" id. at 779-80, and carefully balances all of the factors bearing on that ultimate 
question. In applying per se or quick look analysis, courts make judgments based on judicial experience with certain types of 
restraints and market contexts, without demanding such extensive inquiry into the market in which the specific restraint at issue 
operates. But ""there is often no bright line separating"" the three standards. Id. at 779 (quoting NCAA, 468 U.S. at 104 n.26). 
 [**39] ""What is required . . . is an enquiry meet for the case, looking to the circumstances, details, and logic of a restraint. The 
object is to see whether the experience of the market has been so clear, or necessarily will be, that a confident conclusion about 
the principal tendency of a restriction will follow from a quick (or at least quicker) look, in place of a more sedulous one."" Id. at 
781."
319,15," In Leegin, the Supreme Court overruled its earlier holding that vertical price-fixing agreements were subject to per se 
condemnation. 551 U.S. at 881-82 (overruling Dr. Miles Med. Co. v. John D. Park & Sons Co., 220 U.S. 373, 31 S. Ct. 376, 55 L. 
Ed. 502 (1911)). Earlier, in Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., the Court had ruled that non-price vertical restraints must 
be analyzed under the traditional rule of reason rather than a per se standard. 433 U.S. 36, 97 S. Ct. 2549, 53 L. Ed. 2d 568 
(1977); see Leegin, 551 U.S. at 901. Tying arrangements, however,  [**41] appear to remain an exception to the general rule 
that vertical restraints are reviewed under the full-scale rule of reason. See supra note 13; Sheridan v. Marathon Petroleum Co., 
530 F.3d 590, 593-94 (7th Cir. 2008) (explaining that despite a series of Supreme Court decisions subjecting various vertical 
restraints to the rule of reason, including Leegin, tying is still reviewed under a modified per se standard)."
319,16," Although plaintiffs' First Amended Complaints (FAC) expressly pled a rule-of-reason claim in the alternative, see, e.g., Comm. 
FAC P 530; EB FAC P 454, their Second Amended Complaints omit any reference to the rule of reason, and their moving 
papers and appellate arguments make clear they are alleging exclusively per se violations. In their initial motions to dismiss, 
defendants contended that the First Amended Complaints had not adequately defined a market or pled anticompetitive effects 
and had thus failed to state a claim under the rule of reason. In response, plaintiffs did not assert that they had, in fact, met these 
requirements; they argued only that ""where plaintiffs allege per se claims,"" these requirements do not apply. Plaintiffs' 
Memorandum of Law in Opposition  [**42] to Defendants Motions to Dismiss 43 n.26, filed in the District Court as No. 04-5184, 
Dkt. Entry # 344. In a subsequent submission, plaintiffs explicitly stated that the allegations in their complaints were ""subject to 
per se antitrust analysis, not evaluation under the rule of reason."" Plaintiffs' Reply Brief in Support of Motion for Class "
320,," Certification 1, filed in the District Court as No. 04-5184, Dkt. Entry # 506. Plaintiffs have never disputed the District Court's 
determination that ""[b]ecause Plaintiffs have alleged the Section 1 claim as a per se violation, even at the pleading stage 
Plaintiffs must set forth sufficient facts evidencing a horizontal conspiracy involving market or customer allocation in order for 
their claim to survive a motion to dismiss."" 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25633, 2007 WL 1100449, at *10; see also Defendants' 
Comm. Br. 10 (stating that on appeal, ""[a]s in the district court, Plaintiffs have abandoned any argument that [the complaints] 
state[] a claim under the rule of reason""). Plaintiffs argue only that they have, in fact, adequately pled such horizontal 
conspiracies."
320,17," Twombly affirms that Rule 8(a)(2) requires a statement of facts  [**44] ""suggestive enough"" (when assumed to be true) ""to 
render [the plaintiff's claim to relief] plausible,"" that is, ""enough fact to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal 
evidence of illegal"" conduct. Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556. Iqbal, which reiterated and applied Twombly's pleading standard, 
endorses this understanding. See Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1949-51. Although Fowler v. UPMC Shadyside, 578 F.3d 203 (3d Cir. 
2009), stated that Twombly and Iqbal had ""repudiated"" the Supreme Court's earlier decision in Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A., 534 
U.S. 506, 122 S. Ct. 992, 152 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2002), see Fowler, 578 F.3d at 211, we are not so sure. Clearly, Twombly and Iqbal 
inform our understanding of Swierkiewicz, but the Supreme Court cited Swierkiewicz approvingly in Twombly, see 550 U.S. at 
555-56, and expressly denied the plaintiffs' charge that Swierkiewicz ""runs counter"" to Twombly's plausibility standard, id. at 
569-70. As the Second Circuit has observed, Twombly ""emphasized that its holding was consistent with [the Court's] ruling in 
Swierkiewicz that 'a heightened pleading requirement,' requiring the pleading of 'specific facts beyond those necessary to state 
[a] claim and the grounds showing entitlement to  [**45] relief,' was 'impermissibl[e].'"" Arista Records, 604 F.3d at 120 (quoting 
Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570 (alterations in Arista Records). In any event, Fowler's reference to Swierkiewicz appears to be dicta, 
as Fowler found the complaint before it to be adequate. 578 F.3d at 212; see also id. at 211 (""The demise of Swierkiewicz, 
however, is not of significance here."")."
320,18," As the Supreme Court has noted, ""[c]ontext matters in notice pleading,"" Phillips, 515 F.3d at 232,  [**46] and what suffices to 
withstand a motion to dismiss necessarily depends on substantive law and the elements of the specific claim asserted. See 
Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1950 (""Determining whether a complaint states a plausible claim for relief [so as to satisfy the Twombly 
standard] will . . . be a context-specific task . . . .""); see also id. at 1947 (""In Twombly, the Court found it necessary first to 
discuss the antitrust principles implicated by the complaint. Here too we begin by taking note of the elements [the] plaintiff must 
plead to state [his discrimination] claim . . . ."" (internal citation omitted)). The touchstone of Rule 8(a)(2) is whether a complaint's 
statement of facts is adequate to suggest an entitlement to relief under the legal theory invoked and thereby put the defendant 
on notice of the nature of the plaintiff's claim. See Twombly, 550 U.S. at 565 n.10 (noting that ""a defendant seeking to respond to 
plaintiffs' conclusory allegations in the § 1 [of the Sherman Act] context would have little idea"" how to answer). Some claims will 
demand relatively more factual detail to satisfy this standard, while others require less. See Arista Records, 604 F.3d at 120 
(stating that  [**47] the Supreme Court's recent pleading decisions ""require factual amplification [where] needed to render a "
321,," claim plausible"" (internal quotation marks omitted) (alteration in original)). As discussed below, the question of the sufficiency of 
the complaint in Twombly turned largely on the doctrinal fact that ""antitrust law limits the range of permissible inferences from 
ambiguous evidence in a § 1 case."" Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 588, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. 
Ed. 2d 538 (1986); see Twombly, 550 U.S. at 554-57."
321,19," In a highly concentrated market, ""any single firm's price and output decisions will have a noticeable impact on the market and 
on its rivals,"" such that when any firm in that market ""is deciding on a course of action, any rational decision must take into 
account the anticipated reaction of the other firms."" Flat Glass, 385 F.3d at 359 (internal quotation marks omitted); see 6 Areeda 
& Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law P 1429 (2d ed. 2003). According to this ""theory of interdependence . . . firms in a concentrated 
market may maintain their prices at supracompetitive levels, or even raise them to those levels, without engaging in any overt 
concerted action."" Flat Glass, 385 F.3d at 359. Although this oligopolistic behavior, or ""conscious parallelism,"" is often adverse to 
consumer interests, courts have nonetheless found that it is not, without more, sufficient evidence of a  [**51] § 1 violation, both 
because it is not an agreement within the meaning of the Sherman Act, and because it is resistant to judicial remedies. Id. at 
359-60. But see Richard A. Posner, Antitrust Law 51-100 (2d ed. 2001) (arguing that ""conscious parallelism,"" or ""tacit 
collusion,"" should sometimes suffice to prove a § 1 violation). "
322,20," In fact, ""in actual practice, most courts rely on the absence of motivation or offense to self-interest to preclude a conspiracy 
inference"" from ambiguous evidence or mere parallelism. 6 Areeda & Hovenkamp, supra,  [**53] P 1434c2; see, e.g., 
Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 596-97 (""[I]f petitioners had no rational economic motive to conspire, and if their conduct is consistent 
with other, equally plausible explanations, the conduct does not give rise to an inference of conspiracy.""); Southway Theatres v. 
Georgia Theatre Co., 672 F.2d 485, 494 (5th Cir. Unit B 1982) (The ""basic rule"" is ""that the inference of a conspiracy is always 
unreasonable when it is based solely on parallel behavior that can be explained as the result of the independent business 
judgment of the defendants."")."
322,21," Although Twombly's articulation of the pleading standard for § 1 cases draws from summary judgment jurisprudence, the 
standards applicable to Rule 12(b)(6) and Rule 56 motions remain distinct. In expounding this distinction, some judges and 
commentators have opined that ""[e]ven in those contexts in which an allegation of [conspiracy based on] parallel conduct will not 
suffice to take an antitrust plaintiff's case to the jury, it will sometimes suffice to overcome a motion to dismiss and permit some 
discovery, perhaps  [**55] leaving the issue for later resolution on a motion for summary judgment."" Starr v. Sony BMG Music 
Entm't, 592 F.3d 314, 329 (2d Cir. 2010) (Newman, J., concurring). One of Twombly's formulations of the plausibility pleading 
standard--calling for ""enough fact to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of illegal agreement,"" 550 
U.S. at 556--appears to support this view. See also supra note 17. In any case, a claim of conspiracy might appear plausible in 
light of the well-pled facts in the complaint, only to appear deficient at the summary judgment stage, when (1) the plaintiff can no 
longer rely on mere allegations but must adduce evidence, and (2) the defendant's uncontroverted evidence is also added to the 
picture. "
323,22," Twombly did not explicitly use the term ""plus factor"" in formulating its pleading standard. But the Court did note that the lower-
court decision under review had held that ""plus factors are not required to be pleaded to permit an antitrust claim based on 
parallel conduct to survive dismissal."" Twombly, 550 U.S. at 553 (quoting 425 F.3d 99, 114 (2d Cir. 2005) (emphasis in original)). 
The basis for the Court of Appeals' conclusion was that parallel conduct alone was sufficient to plead a § 1 conspiracy, as long 
as the court could conceive of some set of facts ""that would permit a plaintiff to demonstrate that the particular parallelism 
asserted was the product of collusion rather than coincidence."" 425 F.3d at 114, rev'd, 550 U.S. 544, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 
2d 929. In reversing, the Supreme Court expressly rejected that premise and retired the ""no set of facts"" language from Conley 
v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S. Ct. 99, 2 L. Ed. 2d 80 (1957), on which the Court of Appeals had relied. Twombly, 550 U.S. 
at 561-63.  [**57] By repudiating this premise, the Supreme Court necessarily rejected the proposition that plaintiffs may plead 
conspiracy on the basis of mere parallelism--and thus necessarily required the pleading of plus factors. As Twombly put it, ""[a] 
statement of parallel conduct . . . needs some . . . further circumstance,"" or ""further factual enhancement,"" to plead a plausible § 
1 claim. 550 U.S. at 557. Moreover, as discussed below, the crucial deficiency in the Twombly complaint was that the plaintiffs 
could not demonstrate what we have identified as an important plus factor, see Petruzzi's, 998 F.2d at 1244, namely that the 
defendants' alleged parallel conduct was contrary to their self-interest. Accordingly, although a plaintiff still need not plead 
specific evidence, see supra note 17, Twombly abrogates our earlier statements, see, e.g., Lum, 361 F.3d at 230, that a theory 
of agreement resting on parallel conduct need not plead facts that, if true, would constitute plus factors."
323,23," Courts devised the requirement of ""plus factors"" in the context of offers of proof of an agreement that rest on parallel conduct, 
i.e., circumstantial evidence. On appeals from summary judgment, we have stated that direct evidence of a conspiracy, such as 
a document or conversation explicitly manifesting the existence of the agreement in question--""evidence that is explicit and 
requires no inferences to establish the proposition or conclusion being asserted,"" Baby Food, 166 F.3d at 118--obviates the 
need for such a showing. Rossi, 156 F.3d at 466 (citing Petruzzi's, 998 F.2d at 1233); see also Cosmetic Gallery, Inc. v. 
Schoeneman Corp., 495 F.3d 46, 52 (3d Cir. 2007) (providing examples of direct evidence of conspiracy). ""This is because 
when the plaintiff has put forth direct evidence of conspiracy,  [**60] the fact finder is not required to make inferences to 
establish facts, and therefore the Supreme Court's concerns over the reasonableness of inferences in antitrust cases 
evaporate."" Rossi, 156 F.3d at 466 (citing Petruzzi's, 998 F.2d at 1233); see, e.g., Mack Trucks, 530 F.3d at 222 (noting that a 
statement by a vice president of the defendant was ""direct evidence of collusion, which, if believed, requires no further 
inference""); see also Golden Bridge Tech., Inc. v. Motorola, Inc., 547 F.3d 266, 272 (5th Cir. 2008) (implying the same distinction 
between the treatment of direct and circumstantial evidence), cert. denied, 556 U.S. 1216, 129 S. Ct. 2055, 173 L. Ed. 2d 1149 
(2009); Williamson Oil Co. v. Philip Morris USA, 346 F.3d 1287, 1300 (11th Cir. 2003) (same). Put differently, direct evidence of 
conspiracy, if credited, removes any ambiguities that might otherwise exist with respect to whether the parallel conduct in 
question is the result of independent or concerted action. Twombly noted that no such direct allegations appeared in the complaint before it. See 550 U.S. at 565 n.11 (observing that 
plaintiffs do not ""directly allege illegal agreement"" but rather ""proceed exclusively via allegations of parallel conduct"");  [**61] see 
also id. at 565 n.10 (""Apart from identifying a seven-year span in which the § 1 violations were supposed to have occurred . . ., 
the pleadings mentioned no specific time, place, or person involved in the alleged conspiracies.""). "
324,24," Sometimes, of course, discovery will uncover both direct and circumstantial evidence of agreement. We do not imply that a 
plaintiff must commit to a single method of proof at the pleading stage, but merely that a plaintiff must put forth some statement 
of facts suggestive of unlawful conspiracy. ""[O]nce a claim has been stated adequately, it may be supported by showing any set 
of [evidentiary] facts consistent with the allegations in the complaint."" Twombly, 550 U.S. at 563."
324,25," HN12[
] Twombly thus abrogates our earlier holdings that § 1 plaintiffs can survive a motion to dismiss without alleging facts 
supporting a plausible inference of conspiracy. See, e.g., Bogosian, 561 F.2d at 446. Bogosian correctly observed that ""[i]t is not 
necessary to plead evidence."" Id. at 446; accord id. at 458 (Aldisert, J., dissenting); see also supra note 17. But we think the 
opinion is at odds with Twombly insofar as it absolves plaintiffs of the obligation ""to plead the facts  [**62] upon which the[ir] 
claim is based."" Id. at 446 (majority opinion). Bogosian's formulation of the pleading standard appears to have derived from the 
view that a complaint is sufficient so long as ""it does not appear to a certainty that plaintiffs can prove no set of facts which . . . 
would entitle them to reach the jury,"" id., that is, it appears to reflect precisely the pervasive misapprehension of Federal Rule of 
Procedure 8(a)(2) that led the Twombly Court to ""retire"" the oft cited language from Conley v. Gibson. See Twombly, 550 U.S. at 
560-63. Based on this pre-Twombly understanding of ""the precept that the complaint be liberally construed,"" Bogosian found it 
sufficient that the complaint provided a statement of alleged consciously parallel conduct by the defendants, along with the 
unelaborated assertion that the defendants had entered into a ""combination."" Bogosian, 561 F.2d at 445-46. The opinion did not 
examine whether the allegation of concerted action was plausible in light of the context in which the parallel conduct was 
situated, instead deferring until after discovery the question of whether such conduct might in fact be perfectly consistent with 
each defendant's independent  [**63] self-interest. Id. at 446. Twombly, we think, clearly demands more scrutiny of a § 1 
complaint. As the dissent in Bogosian maintained, ""an allegation of consciously parallel behavior, without more, [does] not state 
a Sherman Act claim,"" id. at 459 (Aldisert, J., dissenting), and a plaintiff cannot merely assert that the defendants' actions were 
concerted without alleging facts plausibly suggesting an agreement. "
327,26," Plaintiffs distinguish contingent commissions from advertising costs on two grounds, neither of which is relevant. First, 
plaintiffs stress that unlike advertising, which is procompetitive, the customer allocation schemes allegedly linked to the 
contingent commission payments were antagonistic to competition. This response, however, misunderstands the thrust of the 
advertising analogy. Even assuming defendants' practices unreasonably restrained trade, plaintiffs' § 1 claims must also 
plausibly suggest that these practices were the product of an agreement among the insurers. The advertising analogy illustrates 
plaintiffs' failure to satisfy this element of their pleading burden; parallel conduct, such as the payment of contingent 
commissions, does not plausibly imply the existence of an agreement when each defendant had a strong, independent motive to 
engage in that conduct. Second, plaintiffs allege that contingent commission agreements were not customary before the brokers' decisions in the 1990's 
to consolidate their pool of insurers, and that the insurers received no additional benefits in exchange for these payments. Even 
if that is true, however--and the complaints'  [**75] assertions of increasing premium revenue by defendant insurers during the 
proposed class period suggest otherwise--the point is that, once the brokers had undertaken that consolidation, insurers had 
much to lose if they did not become a ""strategic partner,"" which provided each of them with an independent business reason to 
pay brokers contingent commissions."
327,27," Plaintiffs contend that ""[i]t strains credulity to insist that an insurer, which repeatedly and systematically receives confidential 
information about a rival's contingent commission arrangements and premium volume, would not expect and understand that its 
rivals were being provided with the same information about its business."" Plaintiff's EB Reply Br. 13. But the allegation 
 [**78] that insurers knew that the brokers would disclose the details of their vertical agreements to other insurer-partners does "
328,," not imply that insurers intended that the information be so disclosed, let alone that they had entered into a horizontal agreement 
with other insurers. Plaintiffs' reliance on United States v. Container Corp. of America, 393 U.S. 333, 89 S. Ct. 510, 21 L. Ed. 2d 
526 (1969), is thus inapposite. In Container Corp., the Supreme Court found that the exchange among competitors of 
information about the prices they charged to customers constituted a horizontal conspiracy to limit price competition in violation 
of the Sherman Act. The disclosure of information alleged here, by contrast, is vertical and, unlike the exchange in Container 
Corp., does not give rise to an inference of harm to competition. See id. at 337; see also id. at 338 (""Price is too critical, too 
sensitive a control to allow it to be used even in an informal manner to restrain competition."")."
328,28," See infra note 31 and accompanying text. We discuss below plaintiffs' argument that the specific means allegedly used to 
steer clients, e.g., first looks, last looks, and the solicitation of intentionally uncompetitive bids, imply a horizontal agreement 
among the insurers. "
329,29, See supra note 6. 
330,30," Plaintiffs place special emphasis on the alleged information-sharing in the HRH- and Wells Fargo/Acordia-centered 
commercial conspiracies, but these allegations do not overcome the basic deficiency we have just described. Plaintiffs allege 
that HRH allocated its book of business among three insurers and assert that ""[t]he number of [insurers] to which HRH allocated 
its business was discussed  [**89] among and agreed to by the three chosen insurers."" Comm. SAC P 242. When we search for 
additional information about this putative agreement, we find mostly allegations common to the other broker-centered 
conspiracies, namely that each insurer-partner knew the identities of the others and the details of their similar contingent 
commission agreements with the broker. Plaintiffs' pleadings suggest that one insurer wanted HRH to have one fewer insurer-
partner than HRH originally had in mind. See Comm. RPS P 281 (""During its negotiations with HRH, [the insurer] was aware of 
the existence of other proposed carrier partners and expressed concern that HRH was considering consolidating its business 
with four Insurers rather than only three, which [the insurer] preferred.""). But this vertical effort to persuade HRH (with apparent 
success) to exclude the participation of a competitor hardly implies horizontal conspiracy among the insurers. (It also stands in 
stark contrast to the hub-and-spoke conspiracies found in Interstate Circuit and Toys ""R"" Us, in which each firm's motivation to 
enter into the vertical agreement was contingent on all of its competitors' doing the same.) To the contrary,  [**90] the obvious 
alternative explanation for the insurer's behavior is a desire to maximize its piece of HRH's guaranteed-premium-volume pie. Similarly, the allegations in the Well Fargo/Acordia conspiracy indicate only that the insurer-partners knew one another's 
identities, and knew that each was benefitting in similar ways from the broker's ability to steer business. They do not imply that 
any insurer-partner's agreement with Wells Fargo/Acordia was dependent on the conduct of its competitors. "
331,31," Hovenkamp's discussion of NYNEX is also relevant to this case: [T]he allegations in [NYNEX] contained an element of fraud, but many thousands of contracts have exchanged exclusivity 
for kickbacks or some deception on consumers or third parties. An agreement giving a waste removal or towing company 
an exclusive right to the buyer's business in exchange for a secret rebate or kickback does not injure competition simply 
because of the fraud. Such a holding would cross the line from antitrust to consumer protection. And while protecting 
consumers from such schemes is certainly a worthy goal of legal policy generally, it is not an antitrust goal."
331,11," Hovenkamp, supra, P 1902d, at 223. Here, too, the basic scheme alleged by plaintiffs is one in which defendant 
 [**92] brokers exchanged exclusivity (premium volume) for kickbacks (contingent commissions). To be sure, here the brokers 
dealt ""exclusively"" with multiple parties--the exclusive dealing involved individual insurance policies (most notably those already 
placed with a particular insurer and up for possible renewal), rather than a broker's entire roster of clients--but this difference 
does not materially alter the basic exclusivity-for-kickbacks model. It merely presents multiple, parallel instantiations of that 
model. "
332,32," Apart from the multiple, detailed incidents of bid rigging in the Marsh-centered commercial conspiracy, plaintiffs appear to 
allege one incident of bid rigging in each of the Willis-centered and Gallagher-centered commercial conspiracies. Comm. SAC 
PP 275, 336. In their briefs and at oral argument, however, plaintiffs's bid-rigging discussion appears to be limited to Marsh and 
its insurer-partners. See, e.g., Tr.  [**99] of Oral Arg. 12 (affirming that ""[t]he specific instances of bid rigging . . . occurred with 
respect to the Marsh broker centered conspiracies [sic]"")."
332,33," See United States v. Heffernan, 43 F.3d 1144, 1146 (7th Cir. 1994) (contrasting bid rotation, in which ""for each job the 
competitors agree which of them shall be the low bidder, and the others submit higher bids to make sure the designated bidder 
wins,"" with identical bidding, in which the competitors all agree to bid the same price)."
332,34," As one treatise explains: A strong inference of coordinated behavior arises when a participant actively seeks to lose a bid. Deliberate sacrifice of a 
contract implies an unusual confidence that the winning party will return the favor. Moreover, spurious bidding indicates an 
awareness of wrongdoing coupled with a desire to hide it by simulating normal bidding. A spurious bid is almost always 
anticompetitive . . . ."
332,6," Areeda & Hovenkamp, supra, P 1420b, at 140. "
333,35," We note that, under Twombly, the test is not whether plaintiffs' allegations necessarily amount to an unlawful horizontal 
agreement, but rather whether they plausibly imply--that is, ""raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence 
of""--such an agreement. 550 U.S. at 556."
333,36," This aspect of the District Court's reasoning as to why the bid rigging does not imply a horizontal agreement is more fully 
developed in its evaluation of the RICO  [**102] claims. See 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 73220, 2007 WL 2892700, at *21. 
Accordingly, the bulk of our analysis on this point occurs in Section II.B.2.a.i. infra. "
334,37," As noted, it may be more precise to say that allegations of brokers' unilateral acts of fraud against their clients, while 
undeniably asserting a form of consumer injury, do not plead an injury to competition, which is adequately alleged in the Marsh-
centered scheme only by virtue of the well-pled horizontal agreement among the insurer-spokes. See supra note 31 and 
accompanying text."
334,38," At oral argument, counsel for plaintiffs explained: ""[T]he defendants take a lot of time talking about how we can't win in a big 
[sic] rigging scheme because we didn't allege a bid rigging scheme. And that's right. We have [instead] alleged an agreement 
among these participants in the Marsh broker-centered conspiracies . . . to protect each other's incumbent business."" Tr. of Oral. 
Arg. 72; see also Letter from Plaintiffs to the District Court, No. 04-5184, Dkt. Entry # 669, at 2 (""[P]laintiffs do not allege that 
defendants are liable under the antitrust laws because they engaged in 'bid-rigging.' Instead, the theory of the Complaint is that 
defendants are  [**106] liable under the antitrust laws because they participated in a conspiracy to allocate customers, using, on 
some occasions, bid-rigging, last looks and other manipulative devices as overt acts to achieve the conspiracies' end."")."
334,39," Furthermore, because of the way plaintiffs have pled their claim, plaintiffs must plead a type of horizontal restraint that can be 
deemed unreasonable without evaluation of market power. See Leegin, 551 U.S. at 886 (HN18[
] ""Restraints that are per se 
unlawful include horizontal agreements among competitors to fix prices or to divide markets."" (internal citations omitted)); cf. 
R.C. Dick Geothermal Corp. v. Thermogenics, Inc., 890 F.2d 139, 162 (9th Cir. 1989) (en banc) (Norris, J., dissenting) (citing 
NCAA, 468 U.S. 85, 104 S. Ct. 2948, 82 L. Ed. 2d 70) (noting that the Supreme Court has ""recognized a caveat to the per se 
rule against horizontal restraints on competition[,] holding that some horizontal relationships have unique aspects that can create 
procompetitive justifications for particular horizontal restraints""). "
335,40," The complaint shows how in providing these intentionally non-competitive bids, the insurers necessarily passed up the 
opportunity to compete. According to the complaint, one insurer who was dissatisfied by Marsh's protection of its own incumbent 
business contemplated supplying competitive bids in response to Marsh's request for non-competitive offers. ""If we can not get 
proper protection,"" the insurer stated, ""we will go hard after [another insurer's incumbent business] that we feel [Marsh is] 
protecting. We will no longer provide [Marsh] with protective quotes for [that insurer] but will put out quotes that [Marsh] will be 
forced to release . . . ."" Comm. SAC P 107."
335,41," See Comm. SAC P 73 (""Given the high degree of financial investment and trust placed in their broker, clients will rarely if ever 
seek quotes from insurers other than those recommended by the broker.""). "
336,42," As the Supreme Court reiterated in Iqbal, the Twombly standard does not impose a ""probability requirement."" Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. 
at 1949 (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556); it does not require as a general matter that the plaintiff plead facts supporting an 
inference of defendant's liability more compelling than the opposing inference. Twombly requires the plaintiff to plead only 
enough ""factual content [to] allow[] the court to draw [a] reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct 
alleged."" Id. (emphasis added). Accordingly, ""[i]t remains an acceptable statement of the standard [for reviewing a motion to 
dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6)] . . . that courts accept all factual allegations as true, construe the complaint in the light most 
favorable to the plaintiff, and determine whether, under any reasonable reading of the complaint, the plaintiff may be entitled to 
relief."" Phillips, 515 F.3d. at 233 (internal quotation  [**114] marks omitted). As noted, of course, Twombly makes clear that in 
the specific context of a claim under § 1 of the Sherman Act, it is unreasonable to infer an agreement from allegations of parallel 
conduct that are equally consistent with independently motivated behavior. See Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556-57."
336,43," As the Supreme Court explained: In applying the[] general standards [of Rule 8(a)(2)] to a § 1 claim, we hold that stating such a claim requires a complaint 
with enough factual matter (taken as true) to suggest that an agreement was made. Asking for plausible grounds to infer an 
agreement does not impose a probability requirement at the pleading stage; it simply calls for enough fact to raise a 
reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of illegal agreement. Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556."
336,44," The number of defendants alleged to have engaged in bid rigging appears to be slightly smaller than the number of 
defendants alleged to be participants in the Marsh-centered commercial conspiracy. Compare Comm. SAC P 95 (naming ""AIG, 
ACE, CNA, Chubb, Crum & Forster, Hartford, Liberty Mutual, Travelers, Zurich, Fireman's Fund, Munich, XL and Axis"" as 
defendant insurers in the Marsh broker-centered conspiracy), with Plaintiffs' Comm. Br. 78 n.17 (claiming that the defendant 
 [**116] insurers that engaged in bid rigging are ""AIG, ACE, Axis, Chubb, XL, Munich/AmRe, Liberty Mutual, St. Paul Travelers, 
Fireman's Fund, and Zurich""), and Comm. RPS PP 27-56 (detailing bid-rigging allegations). Our disposition must also take account of the fact that although the complaint's narrative of wrongdoing speaks primarily (if not 
exclusively) in terms of parent entities or corporate groups, subsidiary corporate entities are also named as individual 
defendants. See Comm. SAC PP 37-63 (stating that the use of the parent or group entity name is meant to incorporate the 
subsidiaries by reference). Defendants contend that the bid-rigging allegations are limited to a single line of commercial 
insurance, namely excess casualty. Plaintiffs appear to concede this point. See Plaintiffs' Comm. Reply Br. 11 (referring to the 
""Marsh Excess Casualty conspiracy""). As noted, without the bid-rigging allegations, plaintiffs have not stated ""enough factual 
matter . . . to suggest that an agreement was made"" among the insurers. Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556. Accordingly, any subsidiary 
entities not alleged to have dealt in excess casualty (and thus not alleged to have engaged in bid rigging) must be dismissed, 
 [**117] as the complaint fails to plausibly imply that they entered into a horizontal agreement to unreasonably restrain trade. "
337,," Plaintiffs argue that subsidiary companies ""act[] at the common direction of the parent[],"" Plaintiffs' Comm. Reply Br. 12, and that 
""in reality a parent and a wholly owned subsidiary always have a unity of purpose or a common design,"" Plaintiffs' EB Reply Br. 
35 (quoting Copperweld, 467 U.S at 771) (internal quotation marks omitted). Emphasizing these features of the parent-
subsidiary relationship, the Supreme Court held in Copperweld that parents and subsidiaries could not conspire for purposes of 
§ 1 of the Sherman Act. 467 U.S. at 776; see Am. Needle, 130 S. Ct. at 2212 (noting that an ""agreement"" is cognizable under § 
1 only if it ""joins together 'independent centers of decisionmaking'"" (quoting Copperweld, 467 U.S. at 769)). Contrary to plaintiffs' 
suggestion, however, it does not follow from Copperweld that subsidiary entities are automatically liable under § 1 for any 
agreements to which the parent is a party. As a matter of well-settled common law, a subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and is 
not liable for the actions of its parent or sister corporations  [**118] simply by dint of the corporate relationship. See 1 William 
Meade Fletcher, Cyclopedia of Law of Private Corporations § 33, at 89 (perm. ed. rev. vol. 2006) (observing that ""the mere fact 
that there exists a parent-subsidiary relationship between two corporations [does not] make the one liable for the torts of its 
affiliates""); see also Burks v. Lasker, 441 U.S. 471, 478, 99 S. Ct. 1831, 60 L. Ed. 2d 404 (1979) (""Congress has never indicated 
that the entire corpus of state corporation law is to be replaced simply because a plaintiff's cause of action is based upon a 
federal statute.""). As plaintiffs allege no other basis for imputing § 1 liability to defendant entities that are not plausibly alleged to 
be directly liable--that is, are not plausibly alleged to have themselves entered into unlawful agreements--the antitrust claims 
against these entities must fail. "
338,45," We find the complaint somewhat ambiguous on this question. Plaintiffs allege that under the customer allocation scheme, 
""each conspiring insurer would be permitted to keep its own incumbent business."" Comm. SAC P 96. But as defendants point 
out, the alleged contingent commission agreements tied commissions to factors other than incumbent business, which might 
motivate Marsh to transfer business away from incumbents. Plaintiffs contend that Marsh only used new business and business 
transferred from non-partner insurers to satisfy these thresholds. More problematic for plaintiffs' claim of guaranteed incumbent 
protection may be the complaint's statement that Marsh ""grouped its preferred insurers into three tiers, classified as A, B, and C 
tiers, based on how much they were paying in contingent commissions. Tiers A and B were the more preferred markets to which 
the bulk of premium was allocated."" Comm. SAC P 101. It is unclear from the complaint's brief description whether incumbent 
business from lower-tier insurers would sometimes be transferred to higher-tier insurers or whether the ""premium"" 
 [**126] mentioned came only from new or non-insurer-partner-held accounts. "
340,46," See,  [**130] e.g., Stop & Shop Supermarket Co. v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of R.I., 373 F.3d 57, 61-64 (1st Cir. 2004) 
(recognizing potential consumer benefits of, and refusing to apply the per se rule to, a vertical ""exclusive dealing"" arrangement in 
which an insurer's pharmacy manager created a ""closed network"" of pharmacies providing prescription benefits to the insurer's 
subscribers); Kartell v. Blue Shield of Mass., Inc., 749 F.2d 922, 924, 932 (1st Cir. 1984) (Breyer, J.) (rejecting physicians' 
antitrust challenge to health insurer's preferred provider organization, which allegedly put pressure on doctors to join ""because of 
the large number of [patient] subscribers,"" and emphasizing that there was no ""evidence of a horizontal conspiracy""); Quality 
Auto Body, Inc. v. Allstate Ins. Co., 660 F.2d 1195, 1203-04 (7th Cir. 1981) (describing procompetitive benefits of insurance 
companies' contracting with a specific set of ""preferred"" auto repair shops for repair work at prescribed rates)."
340,47," The facts in the seminal case of Addyston Pipe offer a useful comparison. There, a cartel of pipe manufacturers rigged bids for 
pipes sold principally to municipalities. The winning bidder would pay a ""bonus"" to the other bidders. First, the amount of the 
winning bid was determined, and then the bidders conducted a competitive bid among themselves to determine who was willing 
to pay the largest bonus to the others. The winner of that competition obtained the right to submit the winning bid in the rigged 
auction. The structure of the scheme meant that the most efficient or lowest-cost manufacturer--and thus the one able to pay the 
largest bonus to the others--would generally win the rigged bid, just as in a competitive market. But the conspiracy 
 [**132] ensured that the price of the winning bid was supracompetitive and output-reducing. Addyston Pipe, 85 F. at 274. The 
court did not find that the competition among the manufacturers within the bounds of the bid-rigging scheme redeemed the 
restraint. Toys ""R"" Us provides another illustration. Suppose the toy manufacturers in that case competed with one another over the 
amount of product Toys ""R"" Us would buy from each. This competition for Toys ""R"" Us's business would not alter the basic fact 
that the horizontal agreement to sell exclusively to Toys ""R"" Us reduced output."
340,48," The Rule nonetheless allows ""[m]alice, intent, knowledge, and other conditions of a person's mind [to] be alleged generally."" 
Id. "
341,49, See Plaintiffs' Comm. Br. 14 n.3; Defendants' Comm. Br. 31.
341,50," In its initial October 3, 2006 opinion, the District Court found that plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint did ""not specifically 
identify the entities which allegedly conspired with each Broker Defendant"" in the alleged broker-centered conspiracies. 2006 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 73055, 2006 WL 2850607, at *13. Granting leave to amend, the court instructed plaintiffs to file a ""supplemental 
statement of particularity"" setting forth, ""with the degree of particularity required under Rule 9(b), the identity of the conspirators 
and the role of each Defendant in the alleged conspiracies."" 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 73055, [WL] at *14. Reviewing these revised 
pleadings in its second dismissal order filed on April 5, 2007, the court pronounced itself ""satisfied . . . with the level of specificity 
contained in the Particularized Statements which identify the majority of the conspirators and their roles in the conspiracy."" 2007 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25633, 2007 WL 1100449, at *15. But the court found that these  [**136] allegations were insufficient to show 
""that the conduct alleged, i.e., the consolidation of the insurance markets and the steering of certain customers based on 
contingent commission payments, constitutes a per se illegal horizontal customer or market allocation scheme."" 2007 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 25633, [WL] at *18. It is unclear whether Rule 9(b) played a role in this determination. In its final antitrust opinion, filed on 
August 31, 2007, and dismissing plaintiffs' claims with prejudice, the District Court appeared to apply only Twombly's plausibility 
standard. See, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 64767, 2007 WL 2533989, at *18-19. Having determined that both complaints failed to 
satisfy this general standard, the court had no occasion to test plaintiffs' allegations against the heightened pleading 
requirements of Rule 9(b)."
341,51," The District Court's Rule 9(b) analysis should be directed to the specific antitrust conspiracy we have found adequately pled 
for purposes of Rule 8(a)(2)--namely, a horizontal agreement among certain of Marsh's insurer-partners not to compete for 
incumbent business. "
342,52," The Employee Benefits complaint ""alleges that the brokers knew, through industry studies and other means, that disclosure of 
[the contingent commission] arrangements would cause a decrease in commission income (which was almost exclusively profit 
to the brokers) of between 5% to 25%."" Plaintiffs' EB Br. 20. But this fact does nothing to strengthen the inference that the 
brokers' similar silence on contingent commissions was the product of an agreement. The ""obvious alternative explanation"" 
remains: each broker decided, perhaps on the basis of the same industry studies, that disclosure was not in its best interest, just 
as each ILEC in Twombly decided that competition with the other regional monopolies would not benefit its bottom line. "
343,53," Plaintiffs describe the alleged ""Global Conspiracy"" as ""the Broker Defendants' agreement not to disclose or advertise truthful 
pricing information and to limit consumer information about price."" Comm. SAC P 358. This language, however, elides the 
significant difference between this case and those in which defendants are alleged to have agreed to refrain from disclosing 
information about their own practices. Cf. Cal. Dental Ass'n v. FTC, 526 U.S. 756, 759-62, 119 S. Ct. 1604, 143 L. Ed. 2d 935 & 
n.1 (1999)  [**143] (describing FTC's allegations that dentists agreed not to engage in advertising about pricing discounts or 
quality of service). When each defendant would be expected to have an independent motive to disclose information about its 
own product or services (such as when that information would presumably enhance the value of that product or services to 
potential customers), the fact that defendants made parallel decisions not to do so conceivably raises a suspicion of agreement. 
Here, by contrast, the allegation is that defendants agreed not to disclose unflattering information about their competitors' 
practices. But given that each defendant is alleged to have engaged in the same practice, so that such disclosure would 
inevitably be self-defeating, the inference that the lack of disclosure is the result of agreement is implausible."
343,54," Plaintiffs do not contend that the exchange of information about reporting techniques was itself unlawful, but argue only that 
this communication evinces a horizontal agreement to report the brokers' compensation improperly on Form 5500. Notably, 
some of the particular exchanges detailed by plaintiffs actually appear to undermine the inference of an agreement not to 
disclose. See, e.g., EB RPS P 63 (noting an e-mail from one insurer to another expressing ""surprise[]"" that the addressee had 
not been reporting its commission payments ""given our conversation on this topic earlier this year""). "
346,55," ""The views of 55 the NAIC are particularly significant, because the Act ultimately passed was based in large part on the 
NAIC['s proposed] bill."" Id."
346,56," Furthermore, as commentators have observed, a construction of the ""business of insurance"" that limited the concept to state-
authorized collaboration would arguably ""be so narrow as not to go beyond the state action antitrust exemption"" set forth in 
Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S. 341, 350-52, 63 S. Ct. 307, 87 L. Ed. 315 (1943), thus rendering the Act's antitrust exemption 
superfluous. Jonathan R. Macey & Geoffrey P. Miller, The McCarran-Ferguson Act of 1945: Reconceiving the Federal Role in 
Insurance Regulation, 68 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 13, 28 n.58 (1993). "
349,57," Cf. Arroyo-Melecio v. Puerto Rican Am. Ins. Co., 398 F.3d 56 (1st Cir. 2005). The plaintiffs in that case alleged a horizontal 
agreement among private insurers not to provide compulsory automobile insurance, in violation of the Sherman Act. According 
to the plaintiffs, the insurers had stakes in a publicly created entity providing such insurance and believed they would ultimately 
reap greater profits if they did not compete with the price set by that entity (which was fixed by Puerto Rican law, although 
private insurers were allowed to charge a lower premium in order to compete to provide the compulsory insurance). The plaintiffs 
also alleged that the private insurers had colluded to coerce brokers to refrain from selling compulsory insurance contracts 
through private companies. The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit decided that the challenged conduct constituted the ""business of insurance"" under the 
second clause of section 2(b) of the McCarran-Ferguson Act. The court determined that ""[h]orizontal agreements among 
insurers to fix the price and to issue policies only through the  [**171] residual market are within the business of insurance."" Id. at 
67. Unlike defendants' alleged agreement here, the insurers' conduct in Arroyo-Melecio was rate fixing in the classic sense: 
because of the public scheme of compulsory insurance, it had the effect of ensuring that no one could purchase insurance 
except at the price prescribed by the public entity. The compulsory insurance scheme and public entity in Arroyo-Melecio also 
brought that case much closer to the McCarran-Ferguson Act's concern to exempt public ratemaking from federal antitrust 
regulation. "
350,58," Cf. Blue Cross, 620 F. Supp. at 917 (qualifying the proposition ""that the selling and advertising of policies is part of the 
business of insurance"" by noting that the  [**176] Supreme Court ""decided the National Securities case many years before 
Royal Drug and Pireno, cases purporting to narrow the 'business of insurance' definition""). "
351,59," Even if we concluded that a per se rule were inappropriate and instead applied a quick look analysis (as plaintiffs urge in the 
alternative), we would still condemn the alleged restraint. As noted, defendants have not put forward a plausible justification for a 
naked horizontal agreement not to compete for renewal customers. "
352,60," As noted, see supra Section II.A.1.a., plaintiffs who seek to condemn a vertical agreement must proceed under the traditional 
rule of reason, which requires plaintiffs to demonstrate anticompetitive effects in the relevant market."
352,61," Section 1954 provides: Whoever being-- (1) an administrator, officer, trustee, custodian, counsel, agent, or employee of any employee welfare benefit plan or 
employee pension benefit plan; or "
353,," (2) an officer, counsel, agent, or employee of an employer or an employer any of whose employees are covered by 
such plan; or (3) an officer, counsel, agent, or employee of an employee organization any of whose members are  [**184] covered 
by such plan; or (4) a person who, or an officer, counsel, agent, or employee of an organization which, provides benefit plan services to 
such plan receives or agrees to receive or solicits any fee, kickback, commission, gift, loan, money, or thing of value because of or 
with intent to be influenced with respect to, any of the actions, decisions, or other duties relating to any question or matter 
concerning such plan or any person who directly or indirectly gives or offers, or promises to give or offer, any fee, kickback, 
commission, gift, loan, money, or thing of value prohibited by this section, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not 
more than three years, or both: Provided, That this section shall not prohibit the payment to or acceptance by any person of 
bona fide salary, compensation, or other payments made for goods or facilities actually furnished or for services actually 
performed in the regular course of his duties as such person, administrator, officer, trustee, custodian, counsel, agent, or 
employee of such plan, employer, employee organization, or organization providing benefit plan services to such plan. "
355,62," The Court noted that § 1961(4), which lists entities ""include[d]"" in the term ""enterprise,"" ""does not purport to set out an 
exhaustive definition of the term,"" and that, ""[a]ccordingly, this provision does not foreclose the possibility that the term might 
include, in addition to the specifically enumerated entities, others that fall within the ordinary meaning of the term 'enterprise.'"" 
Boyle, 129 S. Ct. at 2243 n.2."
355,63," Boyle thus sees what we described in Riccobene as the second element, i.e., continuity, as an inherent component of the 
structure requirement. See Boyle, 129 S. Ct. at 2244 (""Section 1962(c) . . . shows that an 'enterprise' must have some longevity, 
since the offense proscribed by that provision demands proof that the enterprise had 'affairs' of sufficient duration to permit an 
associate to 'participate' in those affairs through 'a pattern of racketeering activity.'""). In other  [**194] words, while Riccobene 
used the term ""structure"" to describe one of several necessary features of an ""enterprise,"" Boyle appears to use ""structure"" as 
an overarching term encompassing all of the requisite elements: common purpose, relationships among those associated with 
the enterprise, and the continuity necessary to allow the associates to pursue the enterprise's purpose. "
356,64," Writing in dissent, Justice Stevens agreed with the majority that ""[t]here may be cases in which a jury can infer [the existence 
of an enterprise] from the evidence used to establish the pattern of racketeering activity."" Id. at 2249 (Stevens, J., dissenting). 
But he believed that should ""be true only when the pattern of activity is so complex that it could not be performed in the absence 
of structures or processes for planning  [**198] or concealing the illegal conduct beyond those inherent in performing the 
predicate acts."" Id. By that standard, Justice Stevens found the jury instructions approved by the majority to be ""plainly deficient."" 
Id. at 2251. In allowing the jury to ""'find an enterprise where an association of individuals, without structural hierarchy, forms 
solely for the purpose of carrying out a pattern of racketeering acts,'"" the instructions failed, he argued, to ""require the 
Government to prove that the alleged enterprise had an existence apart from the pattern of predicate acts."" Id.; see also id. at 
2250 (""By permitting the Government to prove [the 'enterprise' and 'pattern of racketeering activity'] elements with the same 
evidence, the [majority] renders the enterprise requirement essentially meaningless in association-in-fact cases.""). By contrast, 
the majority held that an association-in-fact enterprise need not do anything other than engage in the pattern of racketeering 
activity, so long as it has the requisite structural features (common purpose, interrelationships among its associates, and 
longevity). Cf. Odom v. Microsoft Corp., 486 F.3d 541, 551 (9th Cir. 2007) (en banc) (concluding that  [**199] ""the Supreme 
Court's statement in Turkette that an 'enterprise' is 'an entity separate and apart from the pattern of activity in which it engages'"" 
is not a requirement ""that an associated-in-fact enterprise have a structure beyond that necessary to carry out its pattern of 
illegal racketeering activities,"" but rather ""merely a statement of the obvious: The enterprise and its activity are two separate 
things. One is the enterprise. The other is its activity.""). "
357,65," Turkette evaluated a challenge to the validity of a criminal indictment; Boyle reviewed jury instructions in a criminal case; and 
Riccobene evaluated a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting a criminal RICO conviction."
357,66," Boyle was  [**201] decided after the parties filed their briefs in this appeal. Although plaintiffs' argument distinguishing burdens 
of proof from pleading burdens thus does not explicitly refer to Boyle, its logic would seem to call for interpreting that decision, 
like Turkette and Riccobene, as addressed only to burdens of proof. Plaintiffs also argue, in the alternative, that their allegations adequately plead the enterprise features set forth in the 
Turkette/Boyle line of cases. See infra. "
358,67," We do not imply that Twombly's pleading standard is applicable only to ""big"" cases, but we note that the ""practical"" reasons for 
this standard, see Twombly, 550 U.S. at 557-58, are particularly evident in such cases. "
359,68," We recited the Provenzano standard post-Reves in United States v. Irizarry, 341 F.3d 273, 304 (3d Cir. 2003), without 
addressing the potential tension with Reves or acknowledging that the Second Circuit had recognized the standard's abrogation. 
Irizarry's invocation of the standard appears to be dicta, as our opinion noted that the argument to which it was addressed had 
been waived. Id. In any case, the issue in Irizarry was whether the judge should have instructed the jury that it could not convict 
under § 1962(c) unless the government showed ""that the defendant's motive in committing the predicate act was to further 
 [**211] the affairs of the enterprise."" Id. In finding, correctly, that ""a defendant can commit a predicate act that is detrimental to 
the enterprise so long as the evidence establishes the requisite nexus between the predicate act and the enterprise,"" id., we had 
no occasion to address any other aspects of the Provenzano standard."
359,69," Although we adopt Brandao's definition of the statutory term ""through,"" we believe the decision inverts the relationship 
specified by § 1962(c). Brandao states that ""[a] sufficient nexus . . . exists . . . if the defendant was able to commit the predicate 
acts by means of, by consequence of, by reason of, by the agency of, or by the instrumentality of [i.e., 'through'] his association 
with the enterprise."" 539 F.3d at 53 (internal quotation marks omitted). But the statute provides that a defendant must participate 
in the conduct of an enterprise's affairs through the racketeering activity. See 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). This language dictates that it 
is the predicate acts of racketeering that must be the ""means."""
359,70," Here, § 1962(c) is the only substantive provision invoked by plaintiffs' complaints. "
360,71," In Salinas, the Supreme Court explained § 1962(d)'s relationship to general conspiracy doctrine: The relevant statutory phrase in § 1962(d) is ""to conspire."" We presume Congress intended to use the term in its 
conventional sense, and certain well-established principles follow. . . . When Congress passed RICO in 1970, the American 
Law Institute's Model Penal Code permitted a person to be convicted of conspiracy so long as he ""agrees with such other 
person or persons that they or one or more of them will engage  [**214] in conduct that constitutes such crime."" As the 
drafters emphasized, ""so long as the purpose of the agreement is to facilitate commission of a crime, the actor need not 
agree 'to commit' the crime."". . . A conspirator must intend to further an endeavor which, if completed, would satisfy all of 
the elements of a substantive criminal offense, but it suffices that he adopt the goal of furthering or facilitating the criminal 
endeavor. . . . It is elementary that a conspiracy may exist and be punished whether or not the substantive crime ensues, 
for the conspiracy is a distinct evil, dangerous to the public, and so punishable in itself."
360,522, U.S. at 63-65 (internal citations omitted).
360,72," Salinas appears to hold that a violation of § 1962(d) does not require a consummated violation of a substantive RICO 
provision; it is sufficient that the conspiracy have as its object acts which, if completed, would constitute a substantive violation. 
Whether a plaintiff who had not been injured by a substantive violation would have standing to bring a civil action for violation of 
§ 1962(d), however, is a different question. See 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c) (creating a civil cause of action for ""[a]ny person injured 
 [**215] in his business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962"" and providing for triple damages); Beck v. Prupis, 
529 U.S. 494, 501 n.6, 120 S. Ct. 1608, 146 L. Ed. 2d 561 (2000) (distinguishing ""the question of what constitutes a violation of 
§ 1962(d)"" from ""the meaning of a civil cause of action for private injury by reason of such a violation""). In Beck, the Supreme 
Court explained that ""a civil conspiracy plaintiff cannot bring suit under RICO based on injury caused by any act in furtherance of 
a conspiracy that might have caused the plaintiff injury. Rather . . . a RICO conspiracy plaintiff [must] allege injury from . . . an 
act that is independently wrongful under RICO."" Id. at 505-06 (abrogating Shearin v. E.F. Hutton Group, Inc., 885 F.2d 1162, 
1168-69 (3d Cir. 1989)). Accordingly, the Court held that the petitioner, who had been terminated by his employer for blowing the 
whistle on RICO activities, did not have standing to allege a § 1962(d) violation, since his injury was not ""caused by an overt act 
that is . . . an act of racketeering or otherwise wrongful under RICO."" Id. at 505. At the very least, then, Beck stands for the 
proposition that a plaintiff bringing a § 1962(d) claim for conspiracy to  [**216] violate § 1962(c) must allege injury from a 
racketeering act enumerated in § 1961(1). But Beck did not make clear whether that requisite racketeering act must be part of a 
consummated § 1962(c) violation. Indeed, the Court explicitly reserved the question ""whether a plaintiff suing under § 1964(c) for 
a RICO conspiracy must allege an actionable violation under §§ 1962(a)-(c), or whether it is sufficient for the plaintiff to allege an 
agreement to complete a substantive violation and the commission of at least one act of racketeering that caused him injury."" Id. 
at 506 n.10. "
361,73," We do not address the other grounds relied on by the District Court to support its conclusion that these ""broker-centered 
enterprises"" were inadequately pled. "
362,74," Plaintiffs also allege a ""Marsh-centered enterprise"" in the Employee Benefits complaint, but they do not allege that the 
associates of this ""enterprise"" engaged in bid rigging. For the reasons given above, we agree with the District Court that plaintiffs 
have  [**223] not adequately pled the existence of such an enterprise."
362,75, Defendants do not dispute that the complaint sufficiently alleges the requisite relationships between each insurer and Marsh.
362,76," The number of defendants alleged to have engaged in bid rigging appears to be slightly smaller than the number of 
defendants alleged to be associates of the Marsh-centered enterprise. See supra note 44. Compare Comm. SAC P 502 (naming 
alleged members of an association-in-fact Marsh-centered commercial enterprise), with Plaintiffs' Comm. Br. 78 n.17 (claiming "
363,," that the defendant insurers that engaged in bid rigging are ""AIG, ACE, Axis, Chubb, XL, Munich/AmRe, Liberty Mutual, St. Paul 
Travelers,  [**225] Fireman's Fund and Zurich""), and Comm. RPS PP 27-56 (detailing bid-rigging allegations). While, as noted, 
plaintiffs have declined to plead alternative enterprises consisting of only individual defendants or bilateral relationships, they 
urge us to permit them ""to proceed with their RICO claims as to Marsh and the insurers explicitly alleged to have been involved 
in bid-rigging."" Plaintiffs' Comm. Br. 78 n.17. Such a ""downscaled"" Marsh-centered enterprise has been adequately pled. It may also be worth reiterating that membership in an enterprise is not the touchstone of § 1962(c) liability. Rather, it is the 
operation of that enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering that constitutes a violation. Accordingly, although the 
Commercial complaint here appears to allege that each defendant was a member of the enterprise it ""conducted,"" as a general 
matter defendants who are outside an enterprise may in certain circumstances be held liable under § 1962(c), as the Supreme 
Court has acknowledged. See Reves, 507 U.S. at 184-85."
363,77," The District Court suggested that defendant insurers may have sometimes refused Marsh's request for a false bid. But even if 
there were occasional refusals, we do not believe they would prove fatal to plaintiffs' enterprise allegations. Cf. Boyle, 129 S. Ct. 
at 2245 (""[N]othing in RICO exempts an enterprise whose associates engage in spurts of activity punctuated by periods of 
quiescence.""). "
364,78," The overlap between the District Court's analyses of these two elements is understandable. A defendant cannot participate in 
conducting the affairs of a non-existent enterprise."
364,79," Whether plaintiffs have adequately alleged that defendants participated in the conduct of the Marsh-centered enterprise's 
affairs ""though a pattern of racketeering activity"" is, of course, another matter. This question necessarily turns in part on whether 
plaintiffs have sufficiently pled a ""pattern of racketeering activity."" See infra note 80."
364,80," In their motion to dismiss, defendants also contended that plaintiffs had failed to plead adequately a pattern of predicate 
offenses. In a footnote, the District Court suggested this challenge might have merit but did not conclusively adjudicate it, instead 
granting the motion on the ground that ""Plaintiffs' pleading of the 'enterprise' and 'conduct' elements warrant dismissal without 
granting Plaintiffs leave to amend."" 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 73220, 2007 WL 2892700, at *33 n.29. "
365,81," Plaintiffs conclusorily allege that ""Defendants have conducted or participated in the conduct of the affairs of the CIAB 
Enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity,"" Comm. SAC P 527, but as Twombly observed, ""a plaintiff's obligation to 
provide the grounds of his entitlement to relief requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the 
elements of a cause of action will not do,"" Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555 (internal quotation marks omitted)."
365,82," See, e.g., Comm. SAC P 513 (""CIAB provides Defendants with numerous opportunities to communicate, meet, use vital 
intelligence on market conditions that is shared with its partner members, and reach agreement on how they will address 
challenges in the marketplace . . . .""); id. P 518 (""CIAB provides the Broker Defendants a forum to discuss and reach agreement 
with each other and with the Insurer Defendants regarding, among other things, compensation arrangements and other aspects 
of their relationships, what each wants and needs from the relationship, the market and market conditions, consolidation and 
disclosure.""); id. P 519 (""CIAB hosts 'Executive Forums' . . . [which] allow members the opportunity to 'discuss common 
problems and solutions.'""); id. P 521 (""CIAB has also provided Defendants the opportunity to discuss and reach agreement on 
joint action in response to the regulatory investigations and regarding disclosure issues."");  [**239] id. P 522 (""CIAB provides 
Defendants with numerous opportunities to communicate, meet, use vital intelligence on market conditions that is shared with its 
partner members, and reach agreement on how they will address challenges in the marketplace . . . .""). "
366,83," This possible inference pertains only to the defendant brokers. The complaint does not contain well-pled factual allegations 
plausibly implicating  [**244] the defendant insurers in the creation of the disclosure statements. "
367,84," As noted, the requisite nexus element would not be satisfied by the mere allegation that the defendants' alleged racketeering 
activity benefitted from goods or services provided by the CIAB."
367,85, See supra note 80 and accompanying text.
367,86," The court may choose in its discretion, for instance, to address the adequacy of plaintiffs' fraud allegations before returning to 
the question of the nexus between that alleged fraud and defendants' alleged conduct of the CIAB. "

Relations Act is the establishment and maintenance of industrial peace to preserve the flow of interstate commerce.""). "
381,3," Inherent in the summary nature of quick look and per se analysis is the possibility that a restraint that would survive a full rule of 
reason analysis in a particular case will nonetheless be invalidated: ""[f]or the sake of business certainty and litigation efficiency, 
we have tolerated the invalidation of some agreements that a fullblown inquiry might have proved to be reasonable."" See 
Maricopa County Medical, 457 U.S. at 344. HN4[
] The ultimate inquiry in both analyses is establishing a sufficiently high 
likelihood of anticompetitive effect to justify foreclosing, in the name of certainty and efficiency goals, the possibility that a more 
in depth review would reveal that a restraint was on balance benign or even beneficial. See Major League Baseball Properties, 
Inc. v. Salvino, Inc., 542 F.3d 290, 340 (2d Cir. 2008)  [**18] (Sotomayor, J., concurring) (quick look and per se ""methods of 
analysis are reserved for practices that 'facially appear [] to be one[s] that would always or almost always tend to restrict 
competition and decrease output.' "" (quoting Broad. Music, Inc. v. Columbia Broad. Sys., Inc., 441 U.S. 1, 19-20, 99 S. Ct. 1551, 
60 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1979) (alterations in original)). "
383,4," We note that the district court should not have accorded the expert's statement any weight given its explicitly speculative 
nature. HN7[
] ""An expert's opinions  [**25] that are without factual basis and are based on speculation or conjecture"" are 
inadmissible at trial and are ""inappropriate material for consideration on a motion for summary judgment."" Major League 
Baseball Properties, Inc. v. Salvino, Inc., 542 F.3d 290, 311 (2nd Cir. 2008). "
385,5," This effect has been well understood for many years, and was ably explained well over a hundred years ago by the Kentucky 
Court of Appeal, then the highest court in that state, in the following discussion of a profit sharing arrangement between two 
steamboat companies: There was a strong stimulation to increase the net profits by means other than that of popular favor springing out of efficient 
steamboat facilities and close attention to the business of shipping for reasonable charges and courteous attention to 
passengers at reasonable fare. . . . It is the competition, or fear of competition, that makes these carriers efficient, attentive, 
polite, and reasonable in charges. Remove competition, or the fear of it, and they become extortionate, inattentive, impolite, 
 [**35] and negligent. . . . It is said that neither was bound to charge the same as the other. That is true; but either could 
extort with impunity, and the other would be an equal recipient of the fruit of the extortion. . . . It is true that their contract did "
386,," not, in so many words, bind them to any given charges; but it made it to the interest of each, not only to charge, but to 
encourage and sustain the other in charges that would amount to confiscation. . . . This combination was more than that of 
a combination not to take freight or passengers at less than certain prices. In such case, the combiners have to furnish 
adequate means of transportation, and efficient and polite officers, and confine themselves as nearly as possible to the sum 
agreed upon, in order to secure the trade, or a reasonable portion of it; but here, by reason of the agreement . . . . 
[i]nefficient means of transportation, unskilled or inattentive officials, are no drawback to either boat. Its share of the profits 
come notwithstanding. Anderson v. Jett, 89 Ky. 375, 12 S.W. 670, 671, 11 Ky. L. Rptr. 570 (Ky. 1889). "
387,6," No precise standard exists for determining when a firm or a group of firms controls enough of a market that its actions might 
cause anticompetitive effects. However, the uncontested facts about defendants' share of the market and the fragmented nature 
of the rest of the market together appear to be sufficient to establish the monopoly power over the market required for a violation 
of § 2 of the Sherman Act, a higher standard than is required to find that a firm or firms had sufficient power in the market that 
their actions could violate § 1. See Am. Tobacco Co. v. United States, 328 U.S. 781, 797, 66 S. Ct. 1125, 90 L. Ed. 1575 (1946) 
(a firm over two-thirds of the market is a monopoly); Syufy Enter. v. Am. Multicinema, Inc., 793 F.2d 990, 995 (9th Cir. 1986) (60-
69% market share accompanied by a fragmentation of competition sufficient to show ""monopoly power"" over a market as 
required for violations of § 2 of the Sherman Act); Pac. Coast Agr. Exp. Ass'n v. Sunkist Growers, Inc., 526 F.2d 1196, 1204 (9th 
Cir. 1975) (45-70% share of the market sufficient to show monopoly power  [**44] where no other competitor had more than a 
12% share of the market); Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Technical Servs., Inc., 504 U.S. 451, 481, 112 S. Ct. 2072, 119 L. Ed. 
2d 265 (1992) (""Monopoly power under § 2 requires, of course, something greater than market power under § 1.""); cf. United 
States Energy Information Administration, World Crude Oil Production, 1960-2008, http://www.eia.doe.gov/aer/txt/ptb1105.html 
(last visited January 28, 2009) (during the 1970s OPEC never controlled more than 56% of the world oil market)."
387,7," Another consideration is that a substantial number of alleged competitors product offerings differed substantially from those of 
defendants, including box stores selling goods in bulk, such as Costco, retailers selling a limited selection of products and 
brands, such as Trader Joe's, and stores specializing in organic foods, such as Whole Foods. These markets are by their nature 
incapable of competing for much of the business of traditional supermarkets such as those operated by defendants. 
Notwithstanding these obvious facts, Costco, Trader Joe's, and Whole Foods were each alleged by defendants to have placed 
competitive pressure on them during the labor dispute. "
388,8," Interestingly, economic theory suggests  [**45] an even stronger negative effect on competition: it would appear to predict that, 
at least in the short run, in a market in which large, dominant firms have an agreement limiting competition amongst themselves, 
such an agreement will tend to increase the prices charged by those large firms, and that smaller firms, rather than increasing 
whatever economic pressure they ordinarily exert on those larger firms by charging the lower prices that would obtain under 
competitive conditions in order to attract the larger firms' customers, but will instead charge higher prices close to those being 
charged by the larger firms. See Herbert Hovenkamp, Federal Antitrust Policy § 4.1b (1994). Firms that pool profits are acting as 
a kind of cartel, and cartels that do not contain all the firms in the market are still able to raise prices above the prices that would 
be observed in a competitive marketplace, especially in a short term situation like that present here, in which the fixed costs of 
starting a supermarket (leases, employment and product purchasing contracts, signage, etc.) make it unlikely that new firms 
would enter the market to take advantage of the prices that are artificially high due  [**46] to the cartel's collusive behavior. See 
Dennis W. Carlton & Jeffrey M. Perloff, Modern Industrial Organization 107-115, 122 (3d ed. 2000). Additionally, fixing market 
shares at precartel levels, as defendants essentially did here, is an ""effective technique"" for preventing cheating (in the form of 
competitive behavior) among members of the cartel. See id. at 139-40."
388,9," In terms of diminished consumer demand, the standard economic assumption is that as demand goes down, price goes down 
as well, either in absolute terms or by means of increased discounting. A diminished workforce might be expected to raise prices 
(or, at least, reduce discounting) by reducing the quantity of merchandise that defendants could sell, and, correspondingly, the 
overall supply of such goods in the market. Neither of these effects changes the basic impact of the agreement: defendants had 
little incentive to compete with one another while it was in effect, because any profits earned on sales to another defendant's 
former customers would simply be redistributed back to the other defendant. A more urgent financial condition would appear, if 
anything,  [**50] to make it less likely that defendants would commit resources to competing with each other for customers from 
whom they would receive profits, if at all, only at some future date. To any extent that lower demand, lower supply, or strike-
caused financial woes would prompt a defendant to try to win customers from vendors external to the agreement, the profit 
sharing agreement would, as in a nonstrike period, reduce its incentive for doing so: while the defendant would pay the entire "
389,," cost (in advertising, improved quality, or discounting) of luring such customers, it would only retain a fraction of the benefit 
generated equal to its prestrike share of the market, and a substantial number of the new customers might well, for reasons 
discussed earlier, be lost by the time the labor dispute and profit sharing ended. "
390,10," The obviously anticompetitive nature of defendants' profit sharing agreement in a traditional market setting distinguishes it 
from the restraint in California Dental Association. Here, there is a long history of adjudging profit sharing agreements to be 
anticompetitive and of demonstrating the validity of that conclusion. The unique limits  [**55] on price and quality advertising by 
dentists that were at issue in California Dental Association might have been thought by some to reduce incentives to compete 
over price or quality, because without such advertising it would be difficult for a dentist to inform potential customers about his 
advantages over his competitors, and thus, lowering his prices or expending resources to improve his quality might simply have 
reduced his profits from existing customers. However, the Court reasoned that the nature of the market for ""professional 
services"" such as dental care was unique and that the circumstances made it difficult to compare services across providers and 
to verify price and service information, meaning that price and quality advertising might have been misleading, and misleading 
advertising itself poses dangers to competition. See Cal. Dental Ass'n, 526 U.S. at 771-72. Accordingly, the Court concluded, 
that because of the ""professional context,"" it was not implausible that, as a theoretical matter, the restriction on price advertising 
had either a positive effect or no effect on competition. See id. at 774-75. The Court emphasized that HN15[
] theoretical 
claims of anticompetitive effects  [**56] that are not evident or established in antitrust law must be carefully considered and 
clearly explained in order to justify shifting the burden to defendants to show some procompetitive effect. See id. at 775 n.12. 
Here, the subjective factors that the Court found were critical to the sale of professional services do not exist. Economic theory 
as well as a practical analysis of the factual circumstances make it clear that there is a high likelihood that the profit sharing 
agreement had anticompetitive effects. Unlike California Dental Association, there is a clear theoretical basis for concluding that 
a profit sharing agreement would have anticompetitive effects, and, again unlike California Dental Association, there is no 
plausible basis, theoretical or otherwise, for concluding that the profit sharing agreement had procompetitive effects, see Section 
IV.2 infra. Accordingly, the burden to demonstrate evidence of the restraints procompetitive effects falls on defendants, who do 
not meet it in any way. "
391,11," Defendants' evidence purporting to show that employees charged with pricing during the dispute did not know about the profit 
sharing agreement and took no action because of it, which was relied upon by the district court, also fails to provide support for 
their contentions. Their evidence on this point is both skeletal and somewhat dubious. Defendants do not come close to 
demonstrating that all employees with power over pricing were ignorant of the agreement or  [**59] took no action because of it. 
See, e.g., Declaration of Bryan Davis at P 3 (Albertson's employee describing himself as responsible only for the prices in a 
discreet category of groceries); Declaration of Carla Simpson at P 2 (Safeway employee describing herself as having 
responsibility only for implementing pricing established by another department). Moreover, early in the strike the Los Angeles 
Times published a front page article revealing that the chains had agreed to share the financial burden of the strike. See Nancy 
Cleeland & Melinda Fulmer, In Tactical Move, Union Pulls Pickets From Ralphs, L.A. Times, Nov. 1, 2003, at A1. More 
important, it would defeat entirely the efficiency goals underlying the existence of per se, quick look, and ""meet for the case"" 
analysis if defendants could preclude a summary finding, and proceed to full rule of reason analysis, simply by asserting that the 
employees in charge of pricing did not know about the profit sharing. Such assertions are easy to make, while proving or 
disproving who knew what, and whether the knowledge of a particular individual had any effect on whether the company acted in 
a competitive manner, would require exactly the sort  [**60] of onerous and costly production of evidence that summary review is 
meant to avoid. In any case, as noted above, the quick look inquiry is a probabilistic one: in order to place the burden on 
defendants to demonstrate that the agreement had a procompetitive effect, California need prove only that defendants' 
agreement to share profits created a great likelihood of anticompetitive effects. Accordingly, even if the anticompetitive effects 
had not come to pass because certain employees did not learn of the agreement or did not correctly calculate where the 
company's interests lay in light of the agreement, that fact would be immaterial to the result of our inquiry. "
393,12," The use of the term ""any"" by Justice Breyer demonstrates how difficult it is to write sentences that do not contain ambiguities. 
Clearly, the former professor meant the sentence to state that the law could not logically forbid all competition-restricting 
agreements rather than that it could not logically forbid any one such agreement, no matter how injurious the antitrust violation 
and how questionable the labor law interest. Fortunately, in Brown the message is clear from the sentences surrounding the one 
in question. "
396,13," The fact that the nonstatutory labor exemption is a court-created doctrine that operates to limit the application of antitrust 
statutes created by Congress requires such a consideration. HN25[
] The nonstatutory exemption's authority derives wholly by 
implication from Congress's enactment of the statutory exemption. It thus reaches no further than is necessary to accommodate 
the intent underlying that enactment, and must be reconciled with Congress's other explicit enactments. See Allen Bradley Co., 
325 U.S. at 809-810 (""It  [**81] would be a surprising thing if Congress, in order to prevent a misapplication of [antitrust] 
legislation to [collective bargaining], had bestowed upon [parties to collective bargaining] complete and unreviewable authority . . 
. to frustrate its primary objective.""). "
397,14," The difference between the strike insurance in Kennedy and defendants' profit sharing agreement is that the firms using strike 
insurance in Kennedy paid a fixed amount (as opposed to an amount that varied with revenues) for protection and that 
protection covered only fixed costs, such as property taxes, pension payments and interest charges on debt. See W.P. Kennedy, 
319 F.2d at 369. Unlike defendants under their profit sharing scheme, individual firms purchasing such insurance would retain 
any increase in profits earned during the labor dispute and suffer fully any reduction."
397,15," By applying the exemption to an employer only agreement, the Court appears to have abrogated the Mackey test, which was 
previously the rule in this Circuit for determining when the nonstatutory exemption applied. See Phoenix Elec, Co. v. Nat'l Elec. 
Contractors Ass'n, 81 F.3d 858, 861 (9th Cir. 1996); Cont'l Mar. of San Francisco, Inc. v. Pac. Coast Metal Trades Dist. Council, 
817 F. 2d 1391 (9th Cir. 1987).  [**88] The Mackey test allowed for application of the nonstatutory labor exemption only where 
(1) ""the restraint on trade primarily affects only the parties to the collective bargaining relationship""; (2) ""the agreement sought to 
be exempted concerns a mandatory subject of collective bargaining""; and (3) ""the agreement sought to be exempted is the "
398,," product of bona fide arm's-length bargaining"" between the unions and employers. Mackey v. Nat'l Football League, 543 F.2d 
606, 614 (8th Cir. 1976). While the first two conditions obtained in Brown, the third did not, because an employer-only agreement 
is manifestly not the product of arm's length bargaining between unions and employers. "
399,1," The fourth party to the MSAA, Food4Less, a subsidiary of Ralph's, had a separate contract with UFCW, expiring four months 
later."
399,2," The use of a revenue-sharing agreement in the context of multi-employer bargaining may in fact have a pro-competitive impact, 
but whether it is ethical and/or a practice that our country's labor laws should permit strikes me as a question best left to 
policymakers, not courts. "
403,1," The Honorable Thomas C. Mummert, III, United States Magistrate Judge for the Eastern District of Missouri. The parties 
consented to trial before a United States Magistrate Judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(c), with direct review to this court. "
404,2," For the GPO contract between Novation and Bard for 2005 through 2008, the Acute Urologicals Letter of Commitment -- 
covering catheters -- states: ""Member reserves the right to terminate this letter of commitment at any time upon notice to Bard."""
404,3," According to Bard, its market share for intermittent catheters between 2003 and 2006 was 34 percent. Saint Francis counters 
that Bard's share of intermittent catheter sales under GPO contracts exceeded 60 percent from 2003 to 2008. "
405,4," Missouri antitrust statutes are construed ""in harmony with ruling judicial interpretations of comparable federal antitrust statutes."" 
Mo. Rev. Stat. § 416.141 (2000). "
407,5," For example, the product supplier agreement between Novation and Bard for 2005 through 2008 states: ""Purchases from a 
supplier that does not offer the full product line will not count against the Member's compliance level."" "
410,1," The factual assertions in this section are based on the allegations in Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint unless otherwise 
specified."
410,2, The factual assertions in this paragraph come from Defendant's Motion to Dismiss unless otherwise specified. 
417,1," The facts are taken from the Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint and are presented in the light most favorable to 
plaintiffs. "
422,2," The Court rejects plaintiff's assertion that allegations of unrelated corporate improprieties in Europe help to bestow plausibility 
on the  [**23] allegations of conspiracy in the Complaint The allegation that Dr. De Chirico violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices 
Act at some unspecified time after the conspiracy allegedly began in 2000—conduct for which he was found guilty of bribery by 
an Italian Court in 2008—is insufficiently linked to the allegation of a domestic conspiracy to fix the prices of blood reagents, first 
because it has no bearing on Ortho-Clinical's agreement to participate in the conspiracy, and second because it relies on a chain 
of tenuous assumptions regarding the effect of this violation on the corporate culture of Immueor. Cf. In re Elevator Antitrust 
Litig., 502 F.3d 47, 52 (2d Cir, 2007) (rejecting plaintiff's allegations of anticompetitive conduct overseas, combined with 
argument that ""if it happened there, it could have happened here,"" as supporting a plausible inference of a domestic antitrust 
conspiracy); American Copper & Brass, Ine. v. Halcor S.A., 494 F. Supp. 2d 873, 876-78 (W.D. Tenn, 2007) (rejecting plaintiff's 
use of facts from a European Commission decision to enhance their allegations of a domestic conspiracy). "
423,3," Paragraph E.4 of Case Management Order No, 1, issued on January 19, 2010, describes the procedure to be used by the 
parties in resolving discovery disputes. "
424,4," Although this opinion is not precedential, the Court nevertheless finds it instructive. "
430,1," GE says that it filed the action in the Southern District of Texas (Corpus Christi) because the ITC cannot award damages. This 
opinion will refer to the action in the Southern District of Texas as ""the Corpus Christi action""  [**5] and to those actions 
collectively as ""the ITC/Corpus Christi action."" "
431,2," GE filed its principal brief in the Federal Circuit on June 11, 2010. Mitsubishi obtained an extension of time so that its brief is 
due on August 23, 2010. Oral argument has not been scheduled."
431,3," This opinion will refer to the action in the Northern District of Texas as ""the Dallas action."" The Court will refer to the 
ITC/Corpus Christi action and the Dallas action together as ""the infringement actions."""
431,4, GE obtained the '039 patent from the Enron bankruptcy estate.
431,5," In the Dallas action, Mitsubishi alleges that the '055 patent is unenforceable due in part to the existence of the 1984 DOE 
Report as material prior art but does not allege that the failure to disclose constituted inequitable conduct or fraud. "
432,6," Mitsubishi's complaint includes allegations of the relevant product and geographic market, GE's market dominance, other 
alleged anti-competitive conduct, and antitrust injury. Those allegations are not relevant to the present issues and need not be 
summarized here, except to say that the other competitive acts all relate to threatened enforcement of the patents."
432,7," Eastern R.R. Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 135-37, 81 S. Ct. 523, 528-29, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464 
(1961); United Mine Workers of America v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 664-66, 85 S. Ct. 1585, 1590-91, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626 (1965)."
432,8," The ""objectively baseless"" standard would also apply to Mitsubishi's Lanham Act and tortious interference claims. Dominant 
Semiconductors SDN. BHD. v. OSRAM Gmbh, 524 F.3d 1254, 1260 (Fed. Cir. 2008). Accordingly, the Court need not address 
 [**11] those claims separately from the sham litigation claims because all of them depend on whether GE knew that the patents 
were fraudulently obtained and therefore unenforceable. "
433,9," The elements of a claim for Walker Process fraud are stated in In re Netflix Antitrust Litigation, 506 F. Supp. 2d 308, 314 (N.D. 
Cal. 2007). Because GE's argument focuses on the particularity requirement of Rule 9(b), the elements of a Walker Process 
fraud claim  [**15] need not be reiterated here. "
435,10," See Twombly, 550 U.S. at 558-59, 127 S. Ct. at 1967 (discussing the high cost of discovery in antitrust cases)."
435,11, WAKA involved an antitrust counterclaim alleging that a copyright infringement claim was a sham. 
436,12," This is not to say that the existence of an antitrust violation depends in every instance on an earlier determination that the 
antitrust defendant lost on the merits in the infringement action. See II Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law P 
320 (3rd ed. 2006). The principle is that a successful action cannot be a sham, which means in this instance that the better 
exercise of judicial discretion is to stay this action while the patent actions are being litigated. "
447,1," La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 51:122 states: ""Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of 
trade or commerce in this state is illegal."""
447,2," La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 51:123 states: ""No person shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine, or conspire with any 
other person to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce within this state."" "
449,1," Geoffrey M. Sweeney, a student at the Loyola University of New Orleans College of Law, assisted  [*2] in the preparation of 
this Order and Reasons. "
450,2," The following section details the factual allegations made by the plaintiff, which are accepted as true solely for the purposes of 
ruling on the motions before the Court. "
452,3," The Court recognizes that the federal district courts in the Fifth Circuit have been inconsistent on the question of which party 
bears the burden of proof on a Rule 12(b)(3) Motion to Dismiss for improper venue. Some cases have held that the movant 
bears the burden to establish that venue is improper. See, e.g., Texas Marine & Brokerage, Inc., v. Euton, 120 F.Supp.2d 611, 
612 (E.D. Tex. 2000) (stating that the burden to demonstrate that venue is improper lies with the movant); Sanders v. Seal 
Fleet, Inc., 998 F. Supp. 729, 733 (E.D. Tex. 1998). ""But 'the better view,' and the clear weight of authority, is that when an 
objection has been raised, the burden is on the plaintiff to establish that the district he chose is a proper venue."" 14D CHARLES 
ALAN WRIGHT, ARTHUR R. MILLER, & EDWARD H. COOPER, FEDERAL PRACTICE  [*12] & PROCEDURE § 3826 (3d ed. 2010); see, e.g., 
Terra Nova Sciences, LLC v. JOA Oil and Gas Houston, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 65049, 2010 WL 2671584 at *3 (S.D. Tex. 
2010); Psarros v. Avior Shipping, Inc., 192 F.Supp.2d 751, 753 (S.D. Tex. 2002)."
452,4," In its complaint, Plaintiff did not plead 15 U.S.C. § 22 as grounds for venue in this court. Plaintiff did so in its opposition to 
Defendants' 12(b)(3) motion to dismiss. This Court may consider venue grounds that the plaintiff did not plead in its complaint to 
establish venue. Bro-Tech Corp. v. Purity Water Co. of San Antonio, Inc., 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 72215, 2008 WL 4326345 at *2 
(W.D. Tex. 2008). "
453,5," The Fifth Circuit has addressed how to evaluate whether a corporation conducts business of a substantial character in the 
context of gross sales revenue. See Green v. U.S. Chewing Gum Mfg. Co., 224 F.2d 369 (5th Cir. 1955). In Green, the Fifth 
Circuit reasoned that the test of substantiality is not one  [*15] of percentages. Id. at 371-72. If it were, courts ""would have 
different tests of substantiality applying to different corporations according to their size; a large corporation could, with impunity, 
engage in the same acts which would subject a smaller corporation to jurisdiction and venue."" Id. Instead, the proper test is 
""whether or not the sales would appear to be substantial from the average businessman's point of view."" Id. "
454,6," To succeed in such a motion, the movant must ""clearly demonstrate that the requested transfer is '[f]or the convenience of the 
parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice.'"" In re Volkswagen of America, Inc., 545 F.3d 304, 315 (5th Cir. 2008). It would 
be neither efficient nor in the interests of justice for the Court to transfer a case which, on the merits  [*21] of a 12(b)(6) motion, 
should ultimately be dismissed. "
459,7," It is important to note that customers and competitors do not automatically have antitrust standing. The plaintiff's opposition 
brief focuses mainly on the fact that, as both a consumer and a competitor, it has suffered antitrust injury and should therefore 
have antitrust standing. Such an assertion oversimplifies the antitrust standing analysis. See Atl. Richfield, 495 U.S. at 338; 
accord Cargill, 479 U.S. at 122; Brunswick, 429 U.S. at 488; see also Novell, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp., 505 F.3d 302, 310-314 (4th 
Cir. 2007) (declining to adopt a bright line rule that only consumers and competitors have antitrust standing). "
460,8," As explained infra, ""[r]estraints imposed by agreement between competitors have traditionally been denominated as horizontal 
restraints, and those imposed by agreement between firms at different levels of distribution as vertical restraints."" Bus. Elecs., 
485 U.S. at 730."
460,9," They affect interbrand competition, which is considered to be the ""primary concern of antitrust law."" Continental T.V., Inc. v. 
GTE Sylvania, Inc., 433 U.S. 36, 52 n.19, 97 S. Ct. 2549, 53 L. Ed. 2d 568 (1977) (emphasis added). Interbrand competition is 
the competition among the manufacturers of the same product.9 Ibid."
460,10," They  [*44] generally affect intrabrand competition and are analyzed under the rule of reason. Continental T.V., 433 U.S. at 52 
n.19, 97 S.Ct. at 2558 (emphasis added). Intrabrand competition exists between the distributors of the product of a particular 
manufacturer. Ibid. "
462,11," This type of activity is also referred to as resale price maintenance, which, when conducted in the manner alleged, is a vertical 
restraint. See Leegin Creative Leather Products, Inc. v. PSKS, Inc., 551 U.S. 877, 890, 127 S.Ct. 2705, 2715, 168 L. Ed. 2d 623 
(2007)."
462,12," Horizontal price-fixing remains unlawful per se under the antitrust laws. See Major League Baseball Properties, Inc. v. Salvino, 
Inc., 542 F.3d 290, 315 (2d Cir. 2008) (citing Arizona v. Maricopa County Med. Soc., 457 U.S. 332, 102 S.Ct. 2466, 73 L. Ed. 2d 
48 (1982)). "
464,13," Cross-elasticity of demand is defined as ""[a] relationship between two products, usually substitutes for each other, in which a 
price change for one product affects the price of the other."" BLACK'S LAW DICTONARY 405 (8th ed. 2004)."
464,14," While it is true that ""antitrust law recognizes . . . economically significant submarkets . . . which themselves constitute 
relevant product markets,"" plaintiff has not alleged that the Respironics CPAPs constitute a unique submarket that should be 
considered separately for antitrust purposes. Leegin, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 28505, 2009 WL 938561 at *3 (citing Domed 
Stadium Hotel, Inc. v. Holiday Inns, Inc., 732 F.2d 480, 487-88 (5th Cir. 1984). ""The boundaries of such a submarket may be 
determined by examining such practical indicia as industry or public recognition of the submarket as a separate economic entity, 
the product's peculiar  [*59] characteristics and uses, unique production facilities, distinct customers, distinct prices, sensitivity to 
price changes, and specialized vendors."" Apani, 300 F.3d at 626 (citing Heatransfer Corp. v. Volkswagenwerk, A. G., 553 F.2d 
964, 980 (5th Cir.1977)). Even if this assertion were made, Respironics' CPAPs are not a viable submarket, since ""a submarket 
is still a market"" and ""a single brand cannot be its own market."" Leegin, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 28505, 2009 WL 938561 at *3. "
465,15," Due to the Court's finding that the plaintiff is wholly incapable of defining a relevant product market in support of its antitrust 
claims, the Court need not address the sufficiency of plaintiff's proposed geographic market. "
466,16," ""All persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have the same right in every State and Territory to make and 
enforce contracts, to sue, be parties, give evidence, and to the full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security 
of persons and property as is enjoyed by white citizens, and shall be subject to like punishment, pains, penalties, taxes, licenses, 
and exactions of every kind, and to no other."" 42 U.S.C. § 1981"
466,17," Section 1982 provides that all U.S. citizens have the same right as white citizens to purchase real or personal property. 42 
U.S.C. § 1982. "
467,18," See Walker v. S.W.I.F.T. SCRL, 517 F.Supp.2d 801, 806 (E.D. Va. 2007) (noting that, when evaluating a dismissal motion, not 
every document referenced in the complaint can be considered a part of the complaint; the referenced document must be 
""central or integral to the claim in the sense that its very existence, and not the mere information it contains, gives rise to the 
legal rights asserted."")."
467,19," Plaintiff asserts claims under Texas state law for tortuous interference, civil conspiracy, defamation, and unjust enrichment. "

Stores, Inc. v. Visa U.S.A. Inc., 396 F.3d 96 (2d. Cir. 2005), a class action that ended in a settlement agreement involving 
injunctive relief and payment of more than $3 billion to merchants."
479,2," The plaintiffs are sub-divided into Class Plaintiffs, who are represented by Lead Counsel, and Individual Plaintiffs, who are 
separately represented."
479,3," For example, in addition to the United States and the European Union, Visa and MasterCard's business practices have been 
investigated by government agencies in the United Kingdom, Australia, Colombia, Mexico, New Zealand, Poland, Portugal, 
Norway, Sweden, Brazil, Hungary, and Spain. "
480,4," The Commission's decisions are subject to review by the European Union's judicial branch. Judicial review proceedings are 
commenced in the General Court (known until the Lisbon Treaty as the Court of First Instance), and appeals on points of law 
 [*7] are heard by the European Court of Justice."
480,5," After the Lisbon Treaty' s consolidation of various European treaties, Article 81 of the European Community Treaty is now 
Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. "
481,6," The plaintiffs have not moved to compel production of the recording of that hearing, recognizing that the Court's ruling on the 
instant motion to compel will govern its discoverability."
481,7, Lowe has since been replaced as Director-General for Competition by Dr. Alexander Italianer. 
482,8," The College of Commissioners is the Commission's ruling body. It consists of the twenty-seven Commissioners, one from each 
of the EU's member states."
482,9," The Federal Rules of Evidence exclude a parly's out-of-court statement from the definition of hearsay if the statement is offered 
against that party. Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(A). Similarly excluded from the definition of hearsay is any statement by a parly's 
agent during the agency and concerning a matter within its scope, id. 801(d)(2)(C), and any statement by a co-conspirator during 
the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy. Id. 801(d)(2)(E)."
482,10," Aside from international comity, the Commission relies on the act of state doctrine, which requires American courts to ""refrain 
from examining the validity of an act of a foreign state by which that state has exercised its jurisdiction to give effect to its public 
interests."" See W.S. Kirkpatrick & Co. v. Environmental Tec-Tonics Corp., Int'l, 493 U.S. 400, 403, 110 S. Ct. 701, 107 L. Ed. 2d 
816 (1990). The act of state doctrine is inapposite because the plaintiffs do not ask the court to pass on the validity of any of the 
EU's acts. Rather, they ask the court to resolve a conflict between a valid European law and United States law. Moreover, in this 
context, the argument proves too much, as it would displace the balancing test the Supreme  [*17] Court has prescribed for 
discovery requests that conflict with a foreign sovereign's asserted interests. See Société Nationale Industrielle Aérospatiale v. 
U.S. Dist. Court for the S. Dist. of Iowa, 482 U.S. 522, 107 S. Ct. 2542, 96 L. Ed. 2d 461 (1987). "
484,11," Courts in the Second Circuit have also considered two additional factors, neither of which plays a significant role in this case: 
""the hardship of compliance on the party or witness from whom discovery is sought [and] the good faith of the party resisting 
discovery."" See Strauss v. Credit Lyonnais, S.A., 249 F.R.D. 429, 439 (E.D.N.Y. 2008)."
484,12," The authority the Commission cites in support of a ""cruciality"" test is weak. It quotes a post-Aérospatiale case for the 
proposition that ""the normal discovery standard of whether a document is relevant or is calculated to lead to the discovery of 
admissible evidence . . . should be replaced by the higher standard of whether the requested documents are crucial to the 
resolution of a key issue in the litigation."" Minpeco, S.A. v. Conticommodity Services, Inc., 116 F.R.D. 517, 522 (S.D.N.Y. 1987). 
The quotation, however, comes in a parenthetical citation to a pre-Aérospatiale case, In re Uranium Antitrust Litigation, 480 
F.Supp. 1138, 1146, 1154-55 (N.D.Ill. 1979), and the Minpeco court does not appear  [*23] actually to have applied the 
heightened standard. See 116 F.R.D. at 528."
484,13," One critic of the balancing test has said that it ""calls on the district judge to throw a heap of factors on a table and then slice 
and dice to taste."" Reinsurance Co. of America, Inc. v. Administratia Asigurarilor de Stat, 902 F.2d 1275, 1283 (7th Cir. 1990) 
(Easterbrook, J., concurring)."
484,14," Because discovery orders are generally not appealable at the interlocutory stage, these questions only rarely reach an 
appellate court. (The Aérospatiale case made it beyond the district-court level on a writ of mandamus.) The relative dearth of 
appellate decisions makes it more difficult to identify a coherent body of doctrine."
484,15," As Judge Pohorelsky noted, Air France's risk of prosecution under the blocking statute was more theoretical  [*25] than real. 
See Air Cargo, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 30598, 2010 WL 1189341, at *3. Nevertheless, for the first time since it was passed, the "
485,," French authorities have recently shown some willingness to enforce the blocking statute. Marc J. Gottridge and Thomas 
Rouhette, ""Blocking"" Statutes Bring Discovery Woes, New York Law Journal, Apr. 30, 2008."
485,16," The district court affirmed the Special Master's report without a published opinion, and later rejected the Commission's attempt 
to relitigate the issue. See In re Vitamins Antitrust Litig., Misc. No. 99-197 (TFH), 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25815, 2002 WL 
34499542 (D.D.C. Dec. 18, 2002) (Hogan, J.)."
485,17," The Commission also succeeded in resisting disclosure of unredacted versions of European litigation documents in another 
chemicals antitrust action. See In re Methionine Antitrust Litig., MDL No. 00-1311 CRB (N.D. Cal. June 17, 2002) (Order on Pls.' 
Mot. to Compel Production of Docs. Submitted to Government Authorities). The Special Master concluded that the ""principle [of 
international comity] should be given effect here, particularly in light of the strong statements of the European Commission."" 
 [*28] Id. at 13. "
486,18," Because the plaintiffs' document request is highly specific, the second Aérospatiale factor also counsels in favor of production. "
487,19," I have considered whether I should review the contested documents in camera and have decided that such a review is 
unnecessary. Given the strength of the Commission's interest in confidentiality, I find that there is no reasonable possibility that 
inspecting the documents themselves would make a dispositive difference to the comity analysis. "
501,1," On October 8, 2009, Plaintiffs filed their initial Class Action Complaint. On January 21, 2010, before any of the Defendants had 
answered, Plaintiffs filed their Amended Class Action Complaint. "
503,2," Plaintiffs' reliance on Starr v. Sony BMG Music Entm't, 592 F.3d 314 (2d Cir. 2010) for a contrary standard is misplaced. Starr 
merely stands for the proposition that, in allegations of parallel conduct, a specific time, place, or person involved in the alleged 
conspiracy need not be repeated for  [**12] each conspiracy allegation. Id. at 325. As the Starr court observed: Defendants next argue that Twombly requires that a plaintiff identify the specific time, place, or person related to each 
conspiracy allegation. This is also incorrect. The Twombly court noted, in dicta, that had the claim of agreement in that case "
504,," not rested on the parallel [price fixing] conduct described in the complaint, ""we doubt that the . . . references to an 
agreement among the [Baby Bells] would have given the notice required by Rule 8 . . . [because] the pleadings mentioned 
no specific time, place, or person involved in the alleged conspiracies."" 550 [U.S.] at 565 n.10. In this case, as in Twombly, 
the claim of agreement rests on the parallel conduct described in the complaint. Therefore, plaintiffs were not required to 
mention a specific time, place or person involved in each conspiracy allegation. Id. (emphasis supplied). "

price from the STS system and applying a discount. RHI does not use the DMMS system to discount prices."
522,3, Plaintiff made five separate purchases of furniture and other items from RHI. 
523,4," Plaintiff also purchased a Del Mar ottoman and a Del Mar table. The original price for  [*6] the ottoman was $ 495; the catalog 
price was $ 455, plus $ 45.50 shipping, for a total of $ 500.50. The original price for the table, which was sold in-store with a 
glass top, was $ 850; the catalog price was $ 780, plus $ 78 shipping, for a total of $ 858. Plaintiff's outlet table did not have a 
glass top, and at first she was unaware the table was originally sold with a glass top. Plaintiff believes she paid $ 470 for the 
table, but has no receipt for the purchase, and did not know how much she had paid for several of the other items. Plaintiff did 
not know the original price at RHI's retail stores or the catalog/website price for these items. Plaintiff also made additional purchases at the outlet store of items that had a similar pricing system, depending on whether they 
were purchased at a retail store or from the catalog/website, consisting of two additional Del Mar armchairs, a Del Mar side 
table, four Antibes armchairs, an Antibes dining table. In making the purchases of the Antibes items, she understood how the 
items were priced."
523,5," The court noted that although plaintiff's complaint made no allegations under section 1770, subdivision (a)(13), it considered 
the issue because plaintiff raised that section at the hearing on the motion. "
524,6," In November 2004, California voters adopted Proposition 64, which added a standing requirement to the UCL. Prior to 
Proposition 64, ""any person"" could bring an action under the UCL on behalf of the general public. This broad grant  [*12] of 
standing led to abuses of the UCL which Proposition 64 was intended to remedy; to that end, Proposition 64 added language to 
section 17203 that private individuals ""may pursue representative claims or relief on behalf of others only if the claimant meets 
the standing requirements of Section 17204 and complies with Section 382 of the Code of Civil Procedure."" In turn, section 
17204 was amended to state that an action under the UCL could be brought only by a person ""who has suffered injury in fact 
and has lost money or property as a result of such unfair competition."" "
525,7," Although  [*17] plaintiff's complaint alleged only a violation of Civil Code section 1770, subdivision (a)(14), we consider her 
arguments under subdivisions (a)(5) and (13) of that section because the basic facts of RHI's pricing scheme are not disputed, 
and the application of subdivision (a)(14) to those facts presents an issue of law. (Phillips v. TLC Plumbing, Inc. (2009) 172

544,1," The en banc court has not addressed Princo's arguments that the panel rejected. Accordingly, those portions of the panel's 
opinion are reinstated. "
547,2," Some courts and commentators have questioned the continuing need for the doctrine of patent misuse, which had its origins 
before the development of modern antitrust doctrine. See USM Corp., 694 F.2d at 511 (""Since the antitrust laws as currently 
interpreted reach every practice that could impair competition substantially, it is not easy to define a separate role for a doctrine 
also designed to prevent an anticompetitive practice--the abuse of a patent monopoly.""); Mark A. Lemley, The Economic 
Irrationality of the Patent Misuse Doctrine, 78 Cal. L. Rev. 1599, 1614-20 (1990). The Supreme Court's patent misuse cases 
have not been  [**27] overruled, however, and we therefore apply the principles of patent misuse as that Court's decisions and 
our own prior precedents direct. Senza-Gel, 803 F.2d at 665 n.5."
547,3," The dissent refers on  [**29] several occasions to the Supreme Court's statement in Independent Ink that it ""would be absurd to 
assume that Congress intended to provide that the use of a patent that merited punishment as a felony would not constitute 
'misuse.'"" 547 U.S. at 42. In that statement, however, the Court was simply making the point that Congress's decision to require 
proof of market power to establish patent misuse was powerful evidence that Congress intended proof of market power to be "
548,," similarly required to establish a criminal antitrust violation for the same conduct. The Court was not suggesting that every 
antitrust violation committed by a patentee constitutes patent misuse."
548,4," Princo relies on a single case with unusual facts, Compton v. Metal Products, Inc., 453 F.2d 38 (4th Cir. 1971),  [**33] as 
support for its expansive patent misuse theory. In that case, the patentee agreed, as part of a patent licensing agreement, not to 
compete with the licensee for a period of 20 years. The court held that the non-compete agreement violated ""the common law 
prohibition against agreements in restraint of trade as well as Section 1 of the Sherman Act,"" and it further held that the 
agreement constituted patent misuse that rendered the underlying patents unenforceable against any third-party infringers. Id. at 
44. That case is distinguishable on its facts, but to the extent the court in that case held the patents unenforceable based on the 
patentee's agreement to limit his own freedom of action, we find the court's conclusion that there was patent misuse to be 
unsupported by precedent or reasoning. "
550,5," The dissent suggests in passing that the Sony-Philips agreement also constitutes misuse of the Lagadec patent. How a patent 
that is not enforced can be misused is not explained, nor is it clear why misuse of the Lagadec patent should be a defense 
against infringement of different patents. The dissent cites language from a Second Circuit case,  [**39] SCM Corp. v. Xerox 
Corp., 645 F.2d 1195, 1204 (2d Cir. 1981), which stated that ""a concerted refusal to license patents"" is unlawful and that ""in such 
cases the patent holder abuses his patent by attempting to enlarge his monopoly beyond the scope of the patent granted him."" 
The court's point was that such conduct could violate the antitrust laws; as such, we interpret the court's reference to ""abus[ing] 
his patent"" simply as a shorthand way of making that point, and not as a statement about the law of patent misuse."
550,6," The dissenters argue that antitrust law is not adequate to protect victims of anticompetitive conduct by patentees and that the 
doctrine of patent misuse must be interpreted expansively to fill that gap. Antitrust law, however, provides robust remedies 
including both public and private enforcement. An accused infringer can raise a Sherman Act claim as a counterclaim in an 
infringement action or as an affirmative claim, and is eligible for treble damages and attorney's fees. As to the doctrinal 
limitations that apply to antitrust plaintiffs generally, such as the standing requirement, there is no reason to believe those 
limitations are inappropriate simply because a party is seeking relief against a patentee. "
552,7," Princo argues that the alleged agreement between Philips and Sony was not ""ancillary"" to a collaborative joint venture, based 
on its factual contention that the Lagadec technology ""was not the product of a joint venture, but rather was independently 
developed by Sony."" The panel opinion, however, rejected that argument, noting that ""[t]he Lagadec and Raaymakers 
 [**49] patents stem from the joint efforts of Philips and Sony engineers to develop recordable CDs in the late 1980s. . . . Philips 
and Sony ultimately chose to define the Orange Book standard using the analog Raaymakers . . . approach, not the digital 
Lagadec method."" Princo, 563 F.3d at 1305-06. The panel's opinion was supported by the administrative law judge's findings, 
and by evidence that Sony advanced the proposal that ultimately was incorporated into the Lagadec patent as part of an 
extended course of collaboration with Philips during the 1980s. See Hearing Tr. 372-409 (June 10, 2003). Nothing in Princo's en 
banc presentation persuades us that the panel's description of the development of the Lagadec technology was incorrect. "
555,8," In positing that the asserted agreement between Philips and Sony was unlawful, the dissent draws a distinction between an 
agreement that Sony would not compete with the joint venture and an agreement that Sony would not license the Lagadec 
patent to compete with the joint venture. That distinction is illusory. It would make no difference whether Sony developed the 
alternative technology itself or whether Sony facilitated the development of that technology by licensing a third party to do so; 
either way, Sony would be profiting at the expense of the joint venture. "
557,1," U.S. Patent Nos. 4,999,825 and 5,023,856."
557,2," U.S. Patent No. 4,942,565."
557,3," I,  [**67] like the majority, assume the existence of such an agreement between Philips and Sony, which is not denied by 
Philips. The agreement with the licensees was specifically found by the ITC. In the following discussion, for convenience, I treat 
both agreements as established fact. The majority misreads the dissent and the original panel opinion as limited to concerns 
about the Philips/Sony agreement. See Majority Op. at 23, 26, 34. "
558,4," n"" Absolute time"" refers to the fact that the laser's location is expressed in terms of the time required to scan the spiral groove 
from the start of the disc to the current position. "
559,5," As explained in the panel opinion, the Lagadec patent was included in the patent pool because there was a concern that it 
might cover aspects of the Raaymakers technology, not because the Orange Book standard utilized the basic Lagadec 
technology. As noted, licensees were prohibited from using the Lagadec technology in competition with the Orange Book 
standard."
559,6," The ALJ found that the Ogawa patent was improperly classified as essential given that economically viable alternatives to this 
patented technology existed outside the pool. Initial Determination, slip op. at 212-13. In its review, the ITC took no position on 
the ALJ's analysis of this patent. Final Determination, slip op. at 50-51."
559,7," The majority does not disturb the original panel opinion's ruling that the inclusion of the Lagadec patent in the patent pool did 
not constitute unlawful patent tying. The permissibility of including Lagadec in the pool does not answer the question of whether 
Philips could secure agreements from Sony and the licensees not to use the Lagadec technology for non-Orange Book 
purposes."
559,8," While a remand to determine the existence of the Philips/Sony agreement under my view would still be necessary, even though 
Philips has not disputed the existence of that agreement, based on the subsequent briefing  [**77] I am now convinced that 
there is no need for a remand on the issue of anticompetitive effects, as I discuss below. "
562,9," The parties entered into the letter agreement on September 7, 1993 (the ""1993 agreement""). The 1993 agreement gave Philips 
an ""exclusive right to license such Patent Rights . . . for use in Articles listed in Appendix 2."" J.A. 3319. Appendix 2 lists ""CD-
WO"" (i.e., CD-R) ""Disc"" and ""Recorder."" Id. at 3321. That agreement further noted that ""we confirm with respect to the 
aforementioned Patent Rights . . . that we will license such Patent Rights outside the jointly agreed upon system standards only 
in cases which can reasonably be considered exceptional."" Id. At 3320. As noted earlier, both the majority and I assume for the 
purposes of this appeal that the agreement  [**87] obligated Sony to refrain from licensing the Lagadec patent for any non-
Orange Book purpose."
562,10," Indeed, a similar issue was specifically addressed in Morton Salt Co. v. G.S. Suppiger Co., 314 U.S. 488, 62 S. Ct. 402, 86 L. 
Ed. 363, 1942 Dec. Comm'r Pat. 733 (1942). In Morton Salt, the patent holder had licensed patents for a salt dispenser on 
condition that the licensees use only Morton's salt in the dispensers. Morton argued that the agreement with respect to the salt 
dispensers should be treated separately and that the anticompetitive conduct at most only rendered the salt purchase 
agreement unenforceable; it did not render the salt dispenser patent unenforceable. The Court in Morton Salt disagreed, holding 
that the salt dispenser patent was itself unenforceable. Id. at 492-94. Here, as in Morton Salt, the agreement with respect to the 
suppression of the Lagadec patent cannot be separated from the Raaymakers patents."
562,11," The concurrence suggests that ""at first blush there seems little difference between the agreement allegedly entered into here 
and Sony granting an exclusive license to Philips on the Lagadec patent, which Philips then decides not to practice."" Concurring 
Op. at 2. The difference here is two-fold: Philips did not on its own  [**88] simply decide not to practice the Lagadec patent in 
competition with the Orange Book; Philips agreed with Sony that it would not do so. Philips and Sony also agreed not to grant 
manufacturers licenses to practice Lagadec in competition with the Orange Book. Thus, it was an agreement to suppress a 
potentially competitive technology from ever reaching the market. Such a license agreement clearly lies outside the bounds of 
the patent owner's right to exclude others from using his or her invention. "
563,12," See generally Ill. Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 728-29, 97 S. Ct. 2061, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1977) (prohibiting an indirect 
purchaser from suing a manufacturer to recover gains the manufacturer obtained by violating the antitrust laws)."
563,13," The one possible exception is the provision in § 271(d)(5) providing that tying is not misuse without a showing of market 
power. But the Supreme Court in Illinois Tool Works  [**93] changed antitrust law to make it consistent with § 271(d). See 547 
U.S. at 40-43. "
564,14," As the ITC has recognized here, our court  [**96] ""has indicated that the rule of reason standard to be applied is that 
developed in antitrust law."" In the Matter of Certain Recordable Compact Discs and Rewritable Compact Discs, Inv. No. 337-

564,15," See Zenith Radio, 395 U.S. at 140-41 (explaining that the lower court could find patent misuse on remand even if the alleged 
conduct did not constitute an antitrust violation); Monsanto Co. v. Scruggs, 459 F.3d 1328, 1339 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (quoting C.R.

565,16," See also February 2007 ITC Determination, slip op. at 24 (""Lagadec constitutes, at best, a substitute technology . . . .""). "
566,17," An inherently suspect restraint on competition requires no showing by the plaintiff of market power. See Cal. Dental, 526 U.S. 
at 779 (""[A] challenge to a 'naked restraint on price and output' need not be supported by 'a detailed market analysis' in order to 
'requir[e] some competitive justification' . . . ."" (quoting NCAA, 468 U.S. at 110)); PolyGram, 416 F.3d at 36. If a restraint does 
not qualify as inherently suspect, the plaintiff will need to demonstrate anticompetitive effect either ""indirectly by proving that the 
defendant possessed the requisite market power within a defined market or directly by showing actual anticompetitive effects."" 
Law v. NCAA, 134 F.3d 1010, 1019 (10th Cir. 1998); see Fed. Trade Comm'n v. Ind. Fed'n of Dentists, 476 U.S. 447, 460-61,

not inherently suspect, the ITC found that ""Philips has market power in the United States market for licensing essential US 
patents for the manufacture of CD-R/RWs according to Orange Book standards because . . . there are no close substitutes for 
CD-R/RWs (ID at 160-64)."" Final Determination, slip op. at 27. This ITC finding was sustained by our court in 2005. U.S. Philips 
Corp., 424 F.3d at 1186."
566,18," The majority relies on various cases to support its theory that ""Princo had the burden of showing that the hypothesized 
agreement had an actual adverse effect on competition in the relevant market."" See Majority Op. at 37-38. However, none of 
these cases involved  [**104] an agreement not to compete or suggested there is a burden on the challenging party to establish 
that inherently suspect agreements had actual anticompetitive effects in the marketplace under the ""quick look"" rule of reason 
analysis. For example, the majority relies on California Dental, 526 U.S. 756, 765, 119 S. Ct. 1604, 143 L. Ed. 2d 935. But 
California Dental involved not simply an agreement not to compete, but an agreement not to engage in certain types of 
potentially deceptive advertising. That agreement has no resemblance to the non-compete agreements here. "
567,19," Nor is this a situation in which  [**108] the Lagadec technology was jointly developed by Philips and Sony, as the majority 
suggests. See Majority Op. at 30-32. In fact, the record is clear that the Lagadec technology was separately developed by Sony. 
See J.A. 943 (describing solutions for encoding position data developed by Sony and presented to Philips, including the 
Lagadec solution). Even after the Lagadec technology was rejected for the Orange Book standard, Sony continued to pursue the 
technology, and applied for a U.S. patent over seven months after the Raaymakers technology was adopted for the Orange 
Book and the Lagadec technology was rejected. As noted on page 32, infra, the U.S. patent reflected improvements in the 
Lagadec technology."
567,20," En Banc Br. of Amicus Fed. Trade Comm'n 23 (""[H]ere Princo need not prove that a licensee attempting to develop new 
technology using the Lagadec methodology actually would have succeeded in creating a technically and commercially viable 
technology that could have competed successfully against Philips' and Sony's Orange Book standard. Such a 'showing * * * is 
not an essential step in establishing that the [defendants'] attempt to thwart its achievement * * * was an unreasonable restraint 
of trade.'"" (quoting Ind. Fed'n, 476 U.S. at 461)). "

 [**111] (rejecting proof of the restrictive effect of alleged unlawful practices on competition because ""what would have happened 
but for the adoption of the practice that was in fact adopted . . . would be a standard of proof, if not virtually impossible to meet, 
at least most ill-suited for ascertainment by courts""); United States v. Microsoft Corp., 253 F.3d 34, 79, 346 U.S. App. D.C. 330 
(D.C. Cir. 2001) (en banc, per curiam) (""To require that [Sherman Act] liability turn on a plaintiff's ability or inability to reconstruct 
the hypothetical marketplace absent a defendant's anticompetitive conduct would only encourage monopolists to take more and 
earlier anticompetitive action."")."
568,22," Christopher Cerf & Victor S. Navasky, The Experts Speak: The Definitive Compendium of Authoritative Misinformation 225-27

570,1," The FTC and Minnesota began their closing argument by disclaiming the notion that these cases were ""about unhappiness 
about the high price of Indocin."" Nevertheless, the FTC and Minnesota cited in their post-trial response a press release issued 
by the FTC to announce its action's commencement. The press release asserts that the acquisition of NeoProfen resulted in the 
increase of Indocin IV's price by almost 1300%; characterizes the prices charged by Lundbeck as ""artificially high""; and notes 
one commissioner's view that Lundbeck's ""profiteering on the backs of critically ill premature babies is not only immoral, it is 
illegal."""
570,2," To the extent that the Findings of Fact state Conclusions of Law, they are Conclusions of Law. To the extent that the 
Conclusions of Law state Findings of Fact, they are Findings of Fact. "
572,3," In their closing argument, the FTC and Minnesota stated that ""[t]here is no U.S. law against price gouging,"" that ""[t]here is no 
government price regulation in America,"" and that a legal monopolist may charge a monopoly price. "
591,1," In evaluating the plausibility of Defendant's Counterclaim, the Court's inquiry is limited to whether ""an objective litigant could 
conclude that the [underlying lawsuit] is reasonably calculated to elicit a favorable outcome."" Reichhold, 555 S.E.2d at 293. 
Thus, only a brief examination of Plaintiff's primary cause of action is necessary at this stage. For the same reason, this Order 
should not be interpreted as an endorsement of Plaintiff's claims; the Court's dismissal of Defendant's Counterclaim merely 
reflects a judgment that the underlying lawsuit is not wholly meritless. "
592,2," The Court also considered the array of socks manufactured by third-parties, (Def.'s Answer and Countercl., Ex. 3) which 
Defendant submitted to demonstrate the ""scores of competing products that incorporate a design similar to [Plaintiff's] Running 
sock"" (Def.'s Answer and Countercl., 10). While such evidence could show a mark's lack of strength, the Court  [*15] observed 
that none of those socks incorporated marks nearly as similar to the Sock Shading Mark as Defendant's Trainer sock. "

829,1," Under HN3[
] 28 U.S.C. § 1332(d)(2), federal district courts have jurisdiction over class actions where the amount in controversy exceeds $5,000,000 and any member of the class is diverse in citizenship from any defendant."
829,2," For English translation, www.westlaw.com (Enter ""1994 P.R.-Eng. 909,547"" into search by citation)."
829,3," For cases  [**13] in diversity, this court must defer to the decisions of the Puerto Rico Supreme Court on matters relating to 
Puerto Rico law. See Rodriguez v. Suzuki Motor Corp., 570 F.3d 402, 406 (1st Cir. 2009). "
830,4," Defendants  [**15] point to recent federal precedents dismissing antitrust actions for failure to allege a plausible agreement in 
restraint of trade. (See Docket Nos. 72; 73.) In Twombly, the U.S. Supreme Court found that the complaint failed to allege 
sufficient circumstantial facts to infer the existence of an illegal agreement. Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 553-70, 
127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007). The Court held that a mere allegation of consciously parallel conduct between 
defendants and scant additional details are not enough to establish such an agreement. Id. at 556-57. By contrast, in the instant 
case, Plaintiffs refer to direct evidence of Defendants' criminal conspiracy to engage in a price-setting cartel. (See Docket No. 62 
at 14-21.) Accordingly, Defendants' reliance on Twombly is unavailing. "
831,5," In support of dismissal, Defendants point to a similar case in another federal district. (See Docket Nos. 70; 72; 73.) In that case, 
the district court dismissed the complaint for the plaintiffs' failure to plead the inapplicability of the filed rate doctrine, without 
inquiring into the consistency of charged rates with filed rates. See In re Hawaiian & Guamanian Cabotage Antitrust Litig., 647 F. 
Supp. 2d 1250, 1265-67 (W.D. Wash. 2009). That decision appears to conflict with the controlling precedent in its circuit, which 
does not apply the doctrine if the  [**20] rates at issue have not been approved by a relevant federal agency. See E. & J. Gallo 
Winery v. EnCana Corp., 503 F.3d 1027, 1048 (9th Cir. 2007). "
835,1," The  [*4] redacted version of the First Amended Complaint is referenced in this order, unless otherwise noted. "
836,2," Tin-plate is used by can makers to manufacture cans for food products. Tin-plate is made by hot rolling steel, removing scale or 
rust by pickling it in acid, and coating it with a thin tin layer. A tin-plate manufacturer may coat the can interiors with a thin 
enamel layer. For quality, ""fresh packed"" tomatoes are packed in tin-lined, enamel coated steel cans to resist tomato acid 
penetrating the steel can. "
837,3," ""Supracompetitive"" means artificially high. See Sanders v. Brown, 504 F.3d 903, 909 (9th Cir. 2007), cert. denied, 553 U.S. 
1031, 128 S. Ct. 2427, 171 L. Ed. 2d 229 (2008). "
839,4," Antitrust standing is distinct from Article III constitutional standing. Antitrust standing examines the connection between the 
asserted wrongdoing and the claimed injury to limit the class of potential plaintiffs to those who are in the best position to 
vindicate the antitrust infraction. See In re Circuit Breaker Litig., 984 F. Supp. 1267, 1273 (C.D. Cal. 1997). ""A plaintiff who 
satisfies the constitutional requirement of injury in fact is not necessarily a proper party to bring a private antitrust action."" 
Associated General Contractors of California, Inc. v. California State Council of Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 535, n. 31, 103 S.Ct. 
897, 74 L.Ed.2d 723 (1983).  [*16] Constitutional standing generally requires a showing that plaintiff has suffered actual loss, 
damage or injury, or is threatened with impairment of his or her own interests. Gladstone Realtors v. Village of Bellwood, 441 
U.S. 91, 100, 99 S.Ct. 1601, 1608, 60 L. Ed. 2d 66 (1979). "
840,5," A single antitrust  [*18] violation may have both direct and indirect or ""ripple"" effects on parties that are removed from the actual 
violation at issue. Von Kalinowski, Antitrust Law and Trad Regulation, Ch. XIII, §161.02[3] (2nd ed. Matthew Bender). Price 
increases caused by an antitrust violation may affect ultimate prices at several points in the chain of distribution. Id. Nonetheless, 
Illinois Brick bars such indirect purchasers from harm suffered."
840,6," Illinois Brick is unclear whether a manufacturer who had conspired with his suppliers to fix the price of supplies, raw materials, 
components or sub-assemblies would be immunized from antitrust damage liability to indirect purchasers of finished products. 
As one court recognized: ""Illinois Brick does not mention, let alone discuss, such a situation. The Supreme Court's obvious concern for the 
efficacious enforcement of the antitrust laws, which so informed its decision ..., further sufficiently indicates the lack of any 
intention so to immunize such a manufacturer. The mere fact that the allegedly price-fixed product [i.e., the supplies, raw 
materials, components or sub-assemblies] is only a partial constituent of the ultimate product purchased by the intervening 
plaintiff—as alleged here, where the oil is converted to electricity—should not bar recovery, where there is an allegation of 
privity between suppliers of the raw material and the manufacturer ... The result would be a loophole in the antitrust laws 
that would provide immunity for any price-fixing manufacturer which, for whatever reasons, finds it useful to conspire to fix 
prices with its suppliers. The Court cannot  [*22] believe that the Supreme Court intended such a result without discussing 
it."" Florida Power Corp. v. Granlund, 78 F.R.D. 441, 443 (M.D. Fla. 1978). "
844,7," Defendants did not move to dismiss those claims by plaintiffs who purchased free-standing  [*38] DRAM modules as direct 
purchasers. "
847,8," This is not to say that plaintiff may not challenge subsequent acts by UPI which violate antitrust laws, such as the alleged price 
fixing."
847,9," As explained, infra, plaintiff has dropped and does not argue that it has any other §2 claim, such as a claim for 
""monopolization"" or for ""attempted monopolization."" "
850,10," Their subsequent actions may not be immune from 15 U.S.C. §2, as discussed more fully below. "
852,11," Plaintiff alleges that both U.S. Steel and POSCO had separate facilities which could have produced Tin Mill Produce, but 
which did not, because U.S. Steel and POSCO agreed to combine to form UPI and to exit the market. (Doc. 216, FAC ¶67.) "
853,12," This argument is largely  [*70] moot in light of the Court's ruling on the statute of limitations. The Court addresses the 
argument in light of plaintiff's other allegations of restraint of trade by the joint venture. The Dagher Court held that the rule of 
reason presumptively applied with per se liability reserved only for those agreements that were plainly anticompetitive. For a rule 
of reason claim, ""the finder of fact must decide whether the questioned practice imposes an unreasonable restraint on 
competition, taking into account a variety of factors, including specific information about the relevant business, its condition 
before and after the restraint was imposed, and the restraint's history, nature, and effect."" State Oil Co. v. Khan, 522 U.S. 3, 10, 
118 S.Ct. 275, 139 L.Ed.2d 199 (1997)."
853,13," Plaintiff argues if it failed to allege anticompetitive conduct which violates antitrust law, plaintiff alleged defendants violation of 
tax and environmental laws as anticompetitive conduct. (Doc. 219, Opposition p. 29.) The allegations that the restraint of trade, "
854,," or monopoly  [*72] power, resulted from violations of tax or environmental laws are conclusory and vague and do not tie the 
conduct to anticompetitive effects. "
858,14," In a monopolization claim or an attempted monopolization claim, relevant market is a necessary element. A complaint may be 
dismissed under Rule 12(b)(6) for either of these claims if the complaint's ""relevant market"" definition is facially unsustainable, 
but the relevant market is a factual rather than a legal inquiry.  [*86] Newcal Industries, Inc. v. Ikon Office Solution, 513 F.3d 
1038, 1045 (9th Cir. 2008), cert. denied, 129 S. Ct. 2788, 174 L. Ed. 2d 290 (2009)."
858,15," The Unfair Practices Act has also been called  [*89] the Unfair Business Practices Act and the Unfair Competition Act. Bay 
Guardian Co. v. New Times Media, LLC, 187 Cal. App. 4th 438, 114 Cal. Rptr. 3d 392, 2010 WL 3156631, 24 n.10 (2010). The 
parties refer to the Act as the ""Unfair Competition Law"" (""UCL"") and the Court will adopt the parties' terminology at this point. "
859,16," While not an argument made by defendants, this Court raises the concern of potential ""shot-gun pleading."" Plaintiff 
incorporates all preceding allegations. Incorporation of prior allegations by reference is a valuable tool. It  [*92] is common 
practice to incorporate by reference in later claims for relief various allegations made in earlier claims (typically allegations as to 
jurisdiction, venue, parties, sequence of events). Properly used, such incorporation promotes simple, concise pleadings. 
Fontana v. Haskin, 262 F.3d 871, 877 (9th Cir. 2001). Allegations, however, which incorporate each preceding paragraph, 
regardless of relevancy, are not permitted. This practice has been harshly criticized as a form of ""shotgun pleading"" that violates "
860,," Rule 8's requirement of a ""short and plain statement"" and interferes with the court's ability to administer justice. See generally, 
Byrne v. Nezhat, 261 F.3d 1075, 1129-1130 (11th Cir. 2001). The allegations in this FAC are complex and span a significant 
time period. Avoidance of ""shot-gun"" pleadings goes hand-in-hand with the Court's ruling that plaintiff must allege conduct, by 
conspiracy and by defendants. Generalized grouping of allegations and overall incorporation will not survive an appropriate 
motion. "
871,1," Although there are nominally 133 plaintiffs, all are represented by Mr. Carl Person and all have acted in unison for the purposes 
of each submission to date. "
874,2," As amended, the complaint also includes nine appendices. Appendix A lists plaintiffs who have gone out of business. Appendix 
B-1 compares a sample of approximately 250 wholesale prices paid by various plaintiffs with retail prices contemporaneously 
charged by defendants for the same parts. Appendix B-2 estimates the wholesale price paid by major auto parts retailers by 
deducting an assumed profit margin from the retailers' retail prices. Appendix B-3 lists a sample of auto parts sales to jobber 
plaintiffs (by the defendant manufacturers and certain non-party WDs), plaintiffs' resale price, and plaintiffs' profit margin. 
Appendix B-4 lists the years during which product lines of the defendant manufactures were being sold directly by the 
manufacturers to the major retailers. Appendix B-5 lists the product lines that parts listed in other appendixes belong to. 
Appendix B-6 lists representative auto-parts purchases by plaintiffs or plaintiffs' WD suppliers of manufacturers' product lines. 
Appendix C lists additional competitive details about the plaintiffs and defendants, including the ""M#1 - M#18"" product lines 
carried by the plaintiffs during  [**17] the limitations period. Lastly, appendix D specifies which plaintiffs are suing which 
defendants."
874,3," The Court takes judicial notice of proceedings in Coalition I to establish the fact of that litigation and the nature of the claims 
asserted therein. See Shuttlesworth v. City of Birmingham, Ala., 394 U.S. 147, 157, 89 S. Ct. 935, 22 L. Ed. 2d 162 (1969). "
875,4," The court stated its order on the record as follows: THE COURT: [L]et me advise you of something else which I should have done earlier. There are more than 22 plaintiffs 
and there are more than 25 items. I limited [the trial] to the plaintiff calling only five plaintiffs or less and only talking about 
five items. So if you see only four or five plaintiffs testify, it's because I don't want to hear from all 22 plaintiffs and I don't want to hear 
about every part. You take a representative proof and you can decide yes, no, or what the facts are based on a small 
sampling and I let the plaintiff pick out whoever he wants. So you understand, he's not calling all 22 plaintiffs to the stand and we won't hear about 25 particular items, right? MR. PERSON: Correct, your Honor. "
876,5," ""Buying power"" refers to the ability of a firm that exercises market power to force sellers to reduce price below the level that 
would emerge in a competitive market. See, e.g., Roger G. Noll, ""Buyer Power"" and Economic Policy, 72 Antitrust L.J. 589, 589 
(2005). "
878,6," The story does not quite end there. While defendants' motions were pending, the Supreme Court decided Bell Atlantic Corp. v. 
Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007). In a letter submitted shortly thereafter, defendants argued 
that the decision required the Court to dismiss the complaint. While the complaint assumes discriminatory pricing from the retail 
prices charged by the retailer defendants, those prices, defendants maintained, ""are just as consistent (if not more consistent) 
with an inference of non-discriminatory pricing by the Manufacturer Defendants . . . ."" (Letter from  [**33] Steven M. Edwards to 
Hon. Richard J. Holwell, at 2 (July 11, 2007).) Plaintiffs' letter in response did not dispute this point. Instead, it argued that 
Twombly does not apply to actions under the Robinson-Patman Act. (Letter from Carl E. Person to Hon. Richard J. Holwell, at 1 
(July 19, 2007).) Around the same time, the Second Circuit decided Iqbal v. Hasty, 490 F.3d 143 (2d Cir. 2007). Because the case decided an 
important questions of federal law that had not been settled by the Supreme Court, this Court anticipated that the Supreme 
Court would review the Second Circuit's decision. That prediction proved true, Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 554 U.S. 902, 128 S. Ct. 2931, 
171 L. Ed. 2d 863 (2009), and the Court deferred consideration of defendants' motions until after the Supreme Court decided 
Iqbal. "
879,7," One exception to this general rule applies to preclude a nonparty that has become a litigation agent for a party to the earlier 
case. Taylor, 128 S. Ct. at 2179. This rule is implicated if ""the putative agent's conduct of the suit is subject to the control of the 
party who is bound by the prior adjudication."" Id. Thus defendants argue that the Coalition I plaintiffs who withdrew prior to trial 
were in privity with the judgment plaintiffs therein and should be subjected to preclusion in this action. While all of the plaintiffs in 
both this action  [**38] and Coalition I may be controlled by the Coalition and by plaintiff's attorney, on the present record the 
Court lacks sufficient evidentiary basis to make that conclusion. ""[I]t is incumbent on the defendant to plead and prove such a 
defense."" Id. (noting the availability of targeted interrogatories and deposition questions to acquire the requisite proof). "
881,8," HN13[
] Courts have recognized three general categories of competitive injury that may give rise to a claim under the Act: 
primary line, secondary line, and tertiary line. ""Primary line"" cases involve conduct that injures competition between the seller 
and its direct competitors. ""Secondary line"" cases involve price  [**45] discrimination that injures competition between the 
discriminating seller's customers. In the terminology of these cases, the seller charges ""favored"" purchasers lower prices and 
""disfavored"" purchasers higher prices. ""Tertiary line"" cases involve injury to competition at the level of the purchaser's 
customers. See Volvo, 546 U.S. at 176. This case has elements of both a secondary and tertiary-line case. To the extent the 
retailer defendants compete with two-step retailer WDs, plaintiffs assert traditional secondary-line claims; the retailer defendants 
and two-step WDs compete for customers at the secondary line of competition. To the extent the retailer defendants compete 
with jobbers, plaintiffs assert hybrid secondary/tertiary-line claims; the retailer defendants, who operate at the second level of 
distribution, compete with jobbers, who operate at the third level. "
883,9, Section 2(d) provides in full: 
884,," HN21[
] It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce to pay or contact for the payment of anything of value to 
or for the benefit of a customer of such person in the course of such commerce as compensation or in consideration for any 
services or facilities furnished by or through such customer in connection with the processing, handling, sale, or offering for 
sale of any products or commodities manufactured, sold, or offered for sale by such person, unless such payment or 
consideration is available on proportionally equal terms to all other customers competing in the distribution of such products 
or commodities."
884,15, U.S.C. § 13(d).
884,10," Section 2(e) provides in full: HN22[
] It shall be unlawful for any person to discriminate in favor of one purchaser against another purchaser or 
purchasers of a commodity bought for resale, with or without processing, by contracting to furnish or furnishing, or by 
contributing to the furnishing of, any services or facilities connected with the processing, handling, sale, or offering for sale 
of such commodity so purchased upon terms not accorded to all purchasers on proportionally equal terms."

887,12," The complaint alleges in the alternative that ""the POS program is a promotional program . . . that is being used to resell the 
Manufacturer's auto parts to end users and jobbers by giving AutoZone (i) a larger, more complete inventory of auto parts and 
lines, (ii) lower per-unit costs . . . , (iii) financing to enable AutoZone to increase its number of retail stores, and (iv) a high profit 
margin on sales to enable AutoZone to obtain capital for additional expansion costs . . . ."" (Compl. 126A.) But this contention 
fails for the same reason noted in the text. As described in the complaint, the POS program is a financing program, not an 
""advertising, promotional, or merchandising"" service. "
892,1," For more details concerning plaintiffs' allegations, see Sheet Metal Workers Local 441 Health & Welfare Plan, et al v. 
GlaxoSmithKline, PLC, 263 F.R.D. 205 (E.D. Pa. Nov. 2, 2009). The underlying factual allegations of the original complaint and 
the second amended complaint remain unchanged. "
893,2," Pending before Judge McLaughlin is In re Wellbutrin XL Antitrust Litig. 260 F.R.D. 143 (E.D.Pa. 2009). Although factually 
distinct from this case in some important respects (i.e., that plaintiffs in Wellbutrin XL allege a conspiracy between GSK and a 
generic drug manufacturer to delay the entry of other generic competition into the market for Wellbutrin XL), the named end-
payor plaintiffs in Wellbutrin XL, like the ones in this case, are welfare benefit plans that sent reimbursements for the drug into 
other states. Pending before Judge Brody is In re Flonase Antitrust Litig., 692 F. Supp. 2d 524 (E.D.Pa. 2010).  [**11] The end-payor 
plaintiffs in Flonase are also welfare benefit plans, who allege GSK filed sham citizen petitions in order to delay entry of generic 
versions of Flonase into the market. "
894,3," Plaintiff IBEW - NECA Local 505 Health & Welfare Plan is located in Mobile, Alabama, and purchased or reimbursed its 
members for purchases of Wellbutrin SR in Florida, Missouri, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Massachusetts. Plaintiff Sheet Metal Workers Local 441 Health & Welfare Plan is located in Mobile, Alabama and purchased or reimbursed for 
purchases of Wellbutrin SR in Florida. Plaintiff MC - UA Local 119 Health and Welfare Plan is located in Mobile, AL and purchased or reimbursed its members for 
purchases of Wellbutrin SR in West Virginia, Rhode Island, Georgia, Texas, and Idaho. Plaintiff A.F. of L. - A.G.C. Building Trades Welfare Plan is  [**13] located in Mobile, AL and purchased or reimbursed its 
members for purchases of Wellbutrin SR in Florida. Plaintiff United Food and Commercial Workers Unions and Employers Midwest Health Benefits Fund is located in Illinois and 
purchased or reimbursed its members for purchases of Wellbutrin SR in Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Colorado, 
Florida, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nevada, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, 
Tennessee, and Wisconsin. Plaintiff Sidney Hillman Health Center is located in Rochester, NY and purchased or reimbursed its members for purchases of 
Wellbutrin SR in Florida, North Carolina, and New York. "
895,4," Although other courts have recognized the interests of states where plan members reside largely in the context of the standing 
analysis, I believe it is appropriate to view the choice of law question as relating to the standing question. Under Pennsylvania's 
functional choice of law approach, courts must ask which state has an interest in the outcome. As other courts have recognized, 
antitrust injury takes places in those states where a drug is purchased. See e.g., In re Terazosin Hydrochloride, 220 F.R.D. 672, 
681 (S.D. Fla. 2004); Ferrell v, Wyeth-Ayerst Labs., Inc., No. 01-447, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15127 (S.D. Ohio June 30, 2004) 
(""[T]he purchase  [**19] of Premarin - the critical event causing the alleged antitrust injury . . . allegedly took place in the various 
states where the Funds' members reside.""). The state where drugs are purchased will naturally have a great interest in 
regulating the sale of those drugs within its borders. "
897,5," GSK also claims plaintiffs' Cartwright Act claim should be dismissed because the Act requires that plaintiffs plead intrastate 
conduct or effects. See Appx. B To Mot. To Dismiss, 3."
897,6," Were plaintiffs to assert a cause of action under the Massachusetts antitrust statute, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93 §§ 1-14, it would 
dismissed, as the Supreme Court of Massachusetts has ruled that, ""[b]ecause the Antitrust Act is to be construed in harmony 
with judicial interpretations of comparable Federal antitrust statutes, the rule of law established in Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 
would apply with equal force to preclude claims brought under G.L. c. 93 by indirect purchasers in Massachusetts. Ciardi v. F. 
Hoffmann-La Roche, Ltd., 436 Mass. 53, 762 N.E.2d 303, 308 (Mass. 2002) (internal citations omitted). "
901,7," GSK cites Bowlus v. Alexander & Alexander Servs., Inc., 659 F. Supp. 914, 917 (S.D.N.Y. 1987) in support of its intrastate 
conduct argument. In Bowlus, the district court observed of the Donnelly Act that ""the language  [**37] of the statute itself limits 
its application to conduct within the state."" The court made this observation in the context of deciding whether a plaintiff's 
Donnelly Act claims were properly removed to federal court, not in the context similar to the one now at hand. Importantly, the 
Bowlus court cited Baker v. Walter Reade Theatres Inc., 37 Misc. 2d 172, 237 N.Y.S.2d 795, 797 (Sup. Ct. 1962), in which a 
Donnelly Act claim was dismissed because the primary effect of the agreement at issue was the alleged monopolization of 
business in New Jersey. The Baker court found not that the New York claim should be dismissed because there was not 
intrastate conduct, but rather because the only state in which there were significant consequences was New Jersey. Id. In other words, the caselaw provided by GSK fails to establish that, for anti-competitive conduct to fall within the Donnelly Act, 
the anti-competitive conduct must have taken place in New York. Plaintiffs contend that they were injured by virtue of having 
reimbursed purchases of over-priced drugs. A plain reading of the Donnelly Act exposes a defendant to antitrust liability for ""a 
 [**38] monopoly in the conduct of any . . . trade or commerce . . . in this state."" I see no reason why the sale of goods at 
artificially high monopolistic prices in the state of New York, which is alleged here, would not expose GSK to liability. The 
Supreme Court of Dutchess County has observed that, ""our courts in New York will apply the rule of reason to every 
combination or agreement brought before them under the Donnelly Act. 'Before it will condemn, there must appear the elements 
of injury to the public, or monopolistic control of a particular article of commerce, or unreasonable interference with and damage 
to the business of an individual, or the doing of illegal or unconscionable acts[.]'"" Duhamel v. Multiple Listing Service of Dutchess 
Cnty., Inc., 436 N.Y.S.2d 922, 925, 108 Misc.2d 67 (N.Y. Sup., 1981). Therefore, GSK's intrastate conduct argument is baseless; however, because its unilateral monopolization argument is valid, I 
will dismiss plaintiffs' Donnelly Act claim. "
902,8," In support of its argument, GSK cites Kessel v. Monongalia County Gen. Hosp. Co., 648 S.E.2d 366, 375, 220 W.Va. 602 
(W.Va. 2007), where the Supreme Court of West Virginia observed that, ""[t]he primary distinction between W. Va.Code § 47-18-
3(a) and Section 1 of the Sherman Act is that the West Virginia statute applies to contracts and conspiracies in restraint of trade 
'in this State' while the federal statute is applicable  [**43] to contracts and conspiracies 'in restraint of trade or commerce among 
the several States, or with foreign nations.'"" However, the Court did not address the precise question here, whether the WVAA 
requires substantial effects in West Virginia, and instead considered the extent to which the WVAA's harmonization provision 
could be interpreted to apply to per se violations of the Sherman Act. 220 W.Va. at 611-615. "
903,9," GSK initially claimed Wisconsin's antitrust statute applies only to contracts or combinations in restraint of trade. Plaintiffs 
respond that subsection (2) of Section 133.03, which provides criminal penalties for ""[e]very person who monopolizes, or 
attempts to monopolize, or combines or conspires with any other person or persons to monopolize any part of trade or 
commerce,"" may be applied to their unilateral monopolization allegations against GSK. I agree, and in their reply to plaintiffs' 
response to this argument, GSK conceded this point. See Appx. To Def.'s Reply to Pl.'s Resp., 28. "
905,10," Plaintiffs have alleged that GSK made false statements to the PTO about its intent to claim a BH composition when it applied 
for the '994 patent. However, I ruled on summary judgment, in an opinion that will become binding on the indirect purchasers 
following issuance of this opinion, that plaintiffs have not stated a claim for Walker Process fraud in connection with the '994 
patent."
905,11," Bryant dealt with the application of the ADTPA to a contract claim, so other courts have considered broader definitions of 
unconscionability  [**53] in ruling on antitrust claims asserted under the ADTPA. See New Motor Vehicles, 350 F. Supp. 2d at 
178. "
908,12," As discussed infra Section IV.B.1, plaintiffs have failed to state a claim for a deceptive trade practice aimed at consumers. 
They claim only that GSK made false statements to the PTO, and not that it ever falsely misrepresented the nature of its product 
to consumers. "
910,13," The relevant language of the Arizona statute prohibits ""[t]he act, use or employment by any person of any deception, 
deceptive act or practice, fraud, false pretense, false promise, misrepresentation, or concealment, suppression or omission of 
any material fact with intent that others rely upon such concealment, suppression, or omission, in connection with the sale or 
advertisement of any merchandise[.]"" Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 44-1522(A)."
910,14," In characterizing the nature of numerous state unfair and deceptive trade practice statutes, the court in In re Pharmaceutical 
Industry Average Wholesale Price Litig. 252 F.R.D. 83, Appx. D n. 27 (D. Mass. 2008), observed that ""while Idaho's UDTPA 
refers to 'unfair or deceptive acts or practices,' its general prohibition refers to an enumerated list of prohibited practices, instead 
of simply prohibiting all unfair or deceptive practices. For this reason, Idaho's UDTPA has been excluded from the list of statutes 
that more closely track the FTC Act[,]"" which prohibits all unfair or deceptive acts. "
912,15," In arguing for dismissal of plaintiffs' Minnesota claims, GSK also cites Arrowhead Bluffs, Inc. v. Blackburn, No. C8-03-301, 
2003 Minn. App. LEXIS 1401, 2003 WL 22778336 at *2 (Minn. Ct. App. Nov. 25, 2003), which dismissed claims asserted under 
the Minnesota Prevention of Consumer Fraud Act, codified at Minn. Stat. Ann. § 325F.69(1). Appx. B To Mot. To Dismiss, 7. 
Arrowhead Bluffs does not describe in detail the nature of plaintiffs' allegations before dismissing them, instead relying  [**80] on 
the fact that defendants had not made representations but had rather made investment predictions. 2003 Minn. App. LEXIS 
1401, 2003 WL 22778336 at *2. It does not contain the kind of detailed reasoning that will assist us in assessing plaintiffs' claims 
here. GSK also cites New Motor Vehicles, 350 F. Supp. 2d at 189-190, in which the court dismissed plaintiffs' claims under both 
the Prevention of Consumer Fraud Act and the Minnesota Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act, relying largely on Alsides v. 
Brown. Plaintiffs' response simply states that their allegations ""satisfy the pleading requirements under Minnesota law."" Appx. To 
Pl.'s Resp. To Def.s' Motion, 27. "
914,16," GSK insists that Willard requires dismissal of plaintiffs' Missouri claim, arguing the court ruled ""that defendant's conduct could 
not constitute an unfair practice within the meaning and intent of the act."" Appx. To Def.'s Reply to Plaintiff's Response, 23. 
GSK's reading oversimplifies the holding in Willard. The Willard court found that because there was no evidence that Bic, the 
manufacturer of the lighter, had concealed or suppressed material facts in creating the warning label for the lighter, plaintiffs had 
no cause of action for an unfair practice based on Bic's marketing of the lighter. See Willard, 788 F. Supp. 1059, 1071 (""Bic 
maintains that it has supplied adequate warnings and instructions with its product. Bic submits that these warnings and "
915,," instructions are reasonably calculated to result in safe product usage. The warnings given are not misleading, deceptive or 
untrue. Consequently, Bic asserts that its conduct in marketing the disposable lighter does not amount to an unfair practice 
 [**89] under the Act and this claim should be dismissed."")"
915,17," The practices constituting consumer fraud set forth in subsections (a)-(d) of Section 41.600 could not be construed to relate to 
the scheme alleged here. "
917,18," Judge Brody allowed plaintiffs to proceed with their North Carolina claims in In re Flonase Antitrust Litig, 692 F. Supp. 2d at 
540-41, because ""[p]laintiffs have alleged substantial in-state effect on North Carolina trade or commerce."" "
918,19, A complete discussion of Illinois Brick follows in Section III (C) of this memorandum. 
921,20," For further analysis of Illinois Brick, see Judge Brody's opinion in In re Flonase Antitrust Litig., 692 F. Supp. 2d at 541-543. "
922,21," These states were Tennessee, Arizona, and Vermont."
922,22," Judge Davis observed that ""the success of plaintiffs' common law unjust enrichment claims should not necessarily depend 
upon the success of their state antitrust claims . . . because in practice, equitable remedies for unjust enrichment claims are 
often awarded when state statutory claims prove unsuccessful."" D.R. Ward, 470 F. Supp. 2d at 506. It appears Judge Davis 
might have, if presented with an unjust enrichment claim in a state where indirect purchaser antitrust claims were barred, 
allowed those claims to proceed nonetheless. However, he never reached this ultimate  [**115] issue."
922,23," Of these states, I will dismiss plaintiffs' New York antitrust claims and allow antitrust claims to proceed in Minnesota, Nevada, 
North Carolina, and West Virginia. Of these states, I will dismiss consumer protection claims in Colorado, Massachusetts, 
Minnesota, Nevada, and Rhode Island. I will allow consumer protection claims to proceed in Arkansas and North Carolina. "
924,24, GSK states in its motion to dismiss that this argument applies to ten states but only lists nine. 
928,25," In support of this argument, GSK cites Brenner v. Future Graphics, LLC, 258 F.R.D. 561, 576, (N.D.Ga. 2007), where the 
court dismissed an unjust enrichment claim asserted by indirect purchasers because ""[t]here is no evidence to establish that any 
of named plaintiffs conferred a benefit directly to [defendant]."" The court cited no Georgia law in support of this statement. GSK 
has not cited, and I cannot find, any statement from a Georgia court affirming that Georgia requires conferral of a direct benefit in 
order to state a claim for unjust enrichment. On the contrary, the District of Georgia, in identifying the rare states that would not 
recognize an unjust enrichment claim brought by a consumer against a manufacturer due to some sort of direct benefit 
requirement, did not name Georgia. See In re ConAgra Peanut Butter Prods. Liability Litig., No. 1:07-MD-1845-TWT, 2008 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 40753, 2008 WL 2132233 at *2-3 (N.D.Ga. May 21, 2008) [**139] . Therefore, I do not believe this is a legitimate 
ground for dismissal of plaintiffs' Georgia unjust enrichment claim."
928,26," Even if plaintiffs had presented authority in support of the argument that Idaho allows standalone unjust enrichment claims, I 
would dismiss this claim based on GSK's direct benefit argument. In Hayden Lake Fire Prot. Dist. v. Alcorn, the Idaho Supreme 
Court affirmed the lower's court dismissal of an  [**140] unjust enrichment claim and recognized a precedential Idaho Supreme 
Court ruling establishing that unjust enrichment claims require conferral of a direct benefit. 111 P.3d 73, 91-92, 141 Idaho 388 
(Idaho 2005) (citing Beco Constr. Co., Inc. v. Bannock Paving Co., 118 Idaho 463, 797 P.2d 863 (1990)). In Beco, the court 
considered a number of unjust enrichment cases in Idaho and noted that, in each, ""the plaintiff and defendant had a contractual 
relationship or a claim to real property which were the underlying reasons for the unjust enrichment or quasi contract claims 
between the parties."" 797 P.2d at 867. This Court has also recognized that Idaho requires conferral of a direct benefit in order to 
maintain a cause of action for unjust enrichment. See Powers v. Lycoming Engines, 245 F.R.D. 226, 232 & n. 19 (E.D.Pa. 2007). 
Plaintiffs have cited no contrary authority. "
930,27," The case GSK cites in support of this argument is inapposite. Guarantee Elec. Co. v. Big Rivers Elec. Corp., 669 F. Supp. 
1371, 1380-81 (W.D. Ky. 1987), concerns a specific statute, which requires the filing of a mechanics lien prior to initiating suit 
and applies to contract claims asserted by one who performs labor or furnishes materials - in Guarantee Electric, a 
subcontractor - when that plaintiff asserts claims against one with whom he is not in privity of contract. Id. The narrow scope of 
the mechanic's lien statute does not reach the type of unjust enrichment claim asserted here. "
931,28," GSK cites Aikens v. Microsoft Corp., 159 F. App'x 471, 477 (4th Cir. 2005). Authority from the Fourth Circuit, while relevant, is 
not binding on this court. Moreover, the Fourth Circuit case cited by GSK is an unpublished opinion that is disfavored, except for 
the purpose of establishing res judicata, estoppel, or the law of the case."" See Fourth Circuit Local Rule 32.1. "
933,29," Plaintiffs cite In re Lorazepam & Clorazepate Antitrust Litig., 295 F. Supp. 2d 30 (D.D.C. 2003), where the District of Columbia 
District Court denied motions to dismiss Minnesota antitrust and unjust enrichment claims, allowing both to proceed. This case, 
while relevant, does not contain a discussion of the argument that an unjust enrichment claim must be dismissed because the 
Minnesota antitrust statute does not allow for equitable relief. "
935,30," GSK also argues two other grounds for dismissal of plaintiffs' New York unjust enrichment claim—that allowing such a claim 
would circumvent the limitations inherent in New York's antitrust statute, and that New York's antitrust statute, if applicable, does 
not provide for an equitable remedy. See Appx. B to Mot. To Dismiss, 11, 13. Because I will dismiss plaintiffs' claim on the 
ground discussed above, I will not address these arguments. "
936,31," In support of its direct benefit argument, GSK cites Slover v. Equitable Variable Life Ins. Co., 443 F. Supp. 2d 1272, 1280 
(N.D. Okla. 2006), in which the District Court granted a motion to dismiss unjust enrichment claims against certain defendants. I 
note that this case is factually inapposite. The individual defendants against whom plaintiffs filed the unjust enrichment claim 
were sales agents of the co-defendant life insurance company, and they had not acted as selling agents to the plaintiffs or had 
any other specific contact with them. Id. Any monies paid to the insurance company were not, therefore, paid to the individual 
defendants. More importantly, the case cited by the Slover court does not stand for the proposition that an  [**167] unjust 
enrichment claim requires conferral of a direct benefit. In fact, in this case, N.C. Corff Partnership, Ltd. v. OXY USA, Inc., the 
Court of Appeals of Oklahoma stressed that, ""[a] right of recovery under the doctrine of unjust enrichment is essentially 
equitable, its basis being that in a given situation it is contrary to equity and good conscience for one to retain a benefit which 
has come to him at the expense of another . . . [It] arises . . . where an expenditure by one person adds to the property of 
another."" 1996 OK CIV APP 92, 929 P.2d 288, 295 (Okla. App. 1996) (citing 66 Am. Jur. 2d Restitution and Implied 
Contracts § 3 (1973)). "
938,32," In support of its privity argument, GSK cites Freeman Indus., LLC v. Eastman Chem. Co., 172 S.W.3d 512, 525-26 (Tenn. 
2005), in which the Supreme Court of Tennessee set forth the basic elements of an unjust enrichment claim—that plaintiff 
conferred a benefit on the defendant; that defendant appreciated the benefit; and that it would be inequitable for the defendant to 
retain the benefit—and articulated a fourth element: ""plaintiff must further demonstrate that he or she has exhausted all remedies 
against the person with whom the plaintiff enjoyed privity of contract."" Freeman, 172 S.W.3d at 525. Although the cases cited by 
the Freeman court involved a requirement that a contractor or subcontractor obtain a mechanics lien against the party owing 
them payment for work or materials, the Freeman court extended this exhaustion requirement to the case before it, where the 
plaintiff alleged a price-fixing conspiracy. Id. at 525-26 (citing Paschall's Inc. v. Dozier, 219 Tenn. 45, 407 S.W.2d 150, 153-54; 
Whitehaven Cmty. Baptist Church v. Holloway, 973 S.W.2d 592, 596 (Tenn. 1998)). It recognized an exception to the 
 [**176] exhaustion requirement where pursuit of a remedy ""would be futile,"" but ruled that ""a bare allegation that any attempt to 
exhaust its remedies against the [defendant] would be futile"" is not sufficient to establish futility. Id. at 526. Therefore, it does appear that a Tennessee court would require at least that plaintiffs plead an attempt to exhaust administrative 
remedies or in some way demonstrate that an attempt would have been futile. Plaintiffs' Tennessee unjust enrichment claim 
would therefore likely fail on this ground, as they have not pleaded exhaustion of remedies against GSK. "
940,33," The court concluded that the plaintiff's unjust enrichment claim was inappropriate because ""[t]he allegations required to show 
that a party meets a statutory definition for strict liability are far different than allegations required to show that a party created an 
unjust—in West Virginia, inequitable and unconscionable—situation."""
940,34," GSK also cites A.B. Data, Ltd. v. Graphic Workship, Inc., 2001 WI App 1, 240 Wis. 2d 325, 621 N.W.2d 386, 2000 WL 
1742440 at *3 (Wis. Ct. App. 2000). However, this case sets forth the basic elements of a Wisconsin unjust enrichment claim 
and provides no additional commentary on any direct benefit requirement. "
960,1," For the sake of clarity, when referring to the briefs of the parties, the Court will reference the motion for which the brief was 
originally submitted. "
967,2," Prudential attached excerpts from the filings it submitted to DOBI. In the cover letters submitted with filing forms for 1982, 1984, 
and 1985, for instance, Prudential disclosed that ""[o]n December 17, 1981, because of persistent losses we stopped selling this 
policy although some new policies are issued as conversions from group contracts."" It is appropriate to consider this material on 
a motion to dismiss because it is part of a public filing. See Oran v. Stafford, 226 F.3d 275, 289 (3d Cir. 2000) (holding that 
HN16[
] on a motion for judgment on the pleadings, a court may take judicial notice of public disclosure documents filed with 
the Securities Exchange Commission). Furthermore, Litwack did not object to Prudential's inclusion of the filings in its motion to 
dismiss. "
968,3," HN19[
] Although the filed rate doctrine is like the doctrine of primary jurisdiction in that both involve deference to 
administrative decision-making, the doctrines differ and have developed separately. ""Primary jurisdiction is a doctrine that 
requires a court to transfer an issue within a case that involves expert administrative discretion to the federal administrative 
agency charged with exercising that  [**35] discretion for initial decision."" Richman Bros. Records, Inc. v. U.S. Sprint 
Communications Co., 953 F.2d 1431, 1435 (3d Cir. 1991) (citing Baltimore Bank for Cooperatives v. Farmers Cheese 
Cooperative, 583 F.2d 104, 108 (3d Cir. 1978)). Primary jurisdiction is a procedural question which requires courts to consider 
whether to transfer a portion of a case that is within the expertise of an administrative agency. The filed rate doctrine is more like 
a doctrine of abstention; courts must dismiss the claims to which it applies. "
973,4," The Supreme Court of California declined to review Broberg, 2009 Cal. LEXIS 5288. Notably, in a 2007 case, the Supreme 
Court of California declined to resolve the split over the application of the discovery rule in the UCL context, but assumed, for 
just the purpose of its review in the case before it, that the discovery rule does apply in the UCL context. Grisham, 40 Cal. 4th at 
635 n.7. "
974,5," Additionally, HN40[
] ""[a]ny person may pursue representative claims or relief on behalf of others only if the claimant meets the standing requirements of Section 17204 and complies with § 382 of the California Code of Civil Procedure."" Cal. Bus. & Prof. 
Code § 17203. Section 17204 states that UCL actions may be prosecuted by ""any person who has suffered injury in fact and has 
lost money or property as a result of such unfair competition."" "
975,," HN41[
] Section 382 of the California Code of Civil Procedure, which addresses ""defense by parties on behalf of others having common interests"" enumerates the requirements for such representative suits, including ""when the question is one of a common 
or general interest, of many persons, or when the parties are numerous, and it is impracticable to bring them all before the court, 
one or more may sue or defend for the benefit of all."" "
977,6, Clark cites Cal. Civ. Code §§ 1709-1710 (fraudulent deceit) and §§ 1572-1573 (actual and constructive fraud).

982,8," The plaintiff in Clark v. Superior Court is not in any way related to Beverly Clark, the plaintiff in the case instantly before this 
Court."
982,9," See the discussion section of this Opinion, Part (C)(iii)(c). "
987,10," The TAC asserted five claims for relief: (1) fraudulent misrepresentation, on behalf of Clark, Litwack, and Paul; (2) fraudulent 
omissions, on behalf of Clark, Litwack, and Paul; (3) breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, on behalf of Clark and 
Litwack; (4) violation of California's UCL on behalf of Clark; and (5) violation of the NJCFA on behalf of Litwack. The claims that remain in the case following this motion to dismiss are: (1) fraudulent misrepresentation, on behalf of Clark and 
Paul (with the exception of the portion of Paul's misrepresentation claim that is based on the renewal provision in the CHIP 
policy, which the Court is dismissing in the present opinion); (2) fraudulent omissions, on behalf of Clark and Paul; (3) breach of 
the duty of good faith and fair dealing on behalf of Clark; and (4) violation of California's UCL (although Clark will not be entitled 
to injunctive relief or treble damages on her UCL claim if she prevails, as the Court is dismissing those forms of  [**103] relief in 
the present opinion). "
990,1," Pursuant to stipulation, the Court extended the time for Stathers to answer ICD's complaint. (Docket No. 33.)"
990,2," The Court granted Dreyer's request for judicial notice  [*3] of these documents in its Order of May 28, 2010. (Docket No. 41.) "
995,3," In its 2AC, ICD states that the alleged violations of these statutes constituted ""unfair"" business practices. 2AC ¶ 117. However, 
because ICD states in its opposition that its UCL claim is based on ""violations of . . . 'borrowed' laws,"" Opp'n at 7, the Court 
understands ICD to plead the unlawful prong of the UCL. Pleading the ""unfair"" prong of the UCL requires a plaintiff to plead 
""conduct that threatens an incipient violation of an antitrust law, or violates the policy or spirit of one of those laws because its 
effects are comparable to or the same as a violation of the law, or otherwise significantly threatens or harms competition."" Cel-
Tech Commun's v. L.A. Cellular Telephone Co., 20 Cal. 4th 163, 187, 83 Cal. Rptr. 2d 548, 973 P.2d 527 (1999). As noted 
above, ICD fails to allege harm to competition. "
996,4," ICD requests judicial notice of the distributor agreement it entered into with Dreyer's. Because Dreyer's does not oppose 
request and the content of the document is not subject to reasonable dispute, the Court grants ICD's request. Fed. R. Evid. 201. "
1001,1," These facts are taken from Plaintiff's Complaint, which on a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), 
the Court must accept as true and view in the light most favorable to Plaintiff. Umland v. PLANCO Fin. Servs., Inc., 542 F.3d 59, 
64 (3d. Cir. 2008). "
1006,2," In its Complaint, Plaintiff  [**23] defines Defendants Era Group Inc., Era Helicopters, LLC, Era Aviation, Inc., and Seacor 
Holdings Inc. to be one defendant party designated as ""Era."" (Pl.'s Compl. ¶ 10.) Seacor Holdings Inc. (""Seacor"") objects to this "
1007,," technique, contending that Plaintiff improperly blurs Defendants' separate corporate identities and their potential liabilities. (See 
Def.'s Br., Doc. No. 31.) Seacor also asserts that in July 2005, it sold Era Aviation, Inc., which is no longer an affiliate of Seacor, 
Era Group Inc. or Era Helicopters, LLC. (Id. at 6 n.1.) Seacor further asserts that Era Helicopters, LLC is a wholly-owned 
subsidiary of Era Group Inc., which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Seacor. (Id.) We need not reach Seacor's arguments 
because we conclude that Plaintiff has not adequately alleged an illegal agreement between or among any Defendants."
1007,3," Specifically, Plaintiff alleges: When prices increase substantially during a slump, normal economic behavior cannot provide a rational explanation. After 
the initial price increases [in 2001], economic factors that would ordinarily have led to lower prices in a competitive market 
[decreased demand] continued to affect the industry. . . . When business is declining, enlightened self-interest would 
normally cause a rational economic actor to reduce prices in order to attract more business. Raising prices when demand is 
low would normally be contrary to the self-interest of an operator seeking to increase market share or garner new 
customers or increased sales to existing customers. (Pl.'s Compl. ¶¶ 47, 48.) "
1008,4," Areeda explained  [**28] that HN13[
] in an oligopoly, ""conspiratorial motivation"" and ""acts against self-interest"" often say 
nothing more than the sellers' decisions are ""interdependent,"" in the sense that the profitability of one seller's decision depends 
on the decisions of its rivals: [A] price rise cannot be maintained unless rivals follow. The firm that believes that its profits, and rivals' profits, could be 
increased by raising prices has a motive to reach advance agreement with its rivals. Conspiratorial motivation in the sense 
of a reasonable prospect of increasing profits through collective action is a logical corollary of interdependence. With 
interdependence, rivals can maximize industry profits by coordinating their prices; anticompetitive results can be achieved 
through common action. Motivation is thus synonymous with interdependence and therefore adds nothing to it. ""Action against self-interest"" is also ambiguous. One meaning merely restates interdependence: an act that would be 
against self-interest (failing to reduce price to expand market share) defined without regard to rivals' responses (similar 
reductions depressing industry profits) or against self-interest (initiating price rise) unless rivals  [**29] do the same (follow 
the leader). In this usage, self-interest merely restates interdependence and adds nothing to it. Areeda, supra, ¶ 1434c1, at 244-45 (footnotes omitted). "
1015,1," Both parties title their Motions as ""Motion for Summary Judgment."" The Court notes, however, neither Motion disposes of all of 
the claims of either party. Accordingly, the Court construes both Motions as motions for partial summary judgment."
1015,2," At the time of the Agreement, AERC's sole shareholder was Defendant Root's brother. "
1017,3," ""Paper barrier"" denotes a transaction typically between a large railroad and a small railroad in which the small railroad handles 
the origination or termination of traffic on a branch (short) line and the large railroad handles the ""long-haul"" portion of the rail 
movement. A paper barrier limits the ability of the short-line carrier to interchange traffic with a long-haul railroad other than the 
large railroad selling or leasing the branch line. When BNSF and AERC entered into the 1998 Agreement, it became physically 
possible for AERC to interchange traffic at the Albany rail yard directly with both BNSF and UP, but § 2(c) of the Agreement 
prohibited AERC from interchanging with UP."
1017,4," Sweet Home is a facility that was not open to rail service from a carrier other than BNSF before BNSF entered into the 
Agreement with AERC. Lebanon, however, is a facility that was open to rail service from carriers other than BNSF before the 
Agreement. "
1019,5," Although the parties refer to this doctrine as res judicata, courts now often refer to it as claim preclusion. See Cell Therapeutics, 
Inc. v. Lash Group, Inc., No. 08-35619, 2010 U.S. App. LEXIS 355, 2010 WL 22686, at *8 (9th Cir. Jan. 6, 2010)(""Claim 
preclusion, often referred to as res judicata, bars any subsequent suit on claims that were raised or could have been raised in a 
prior action.""). For purposes of clarity, the Court will refer to the doctrine as res judicata. "
1021,6, The Court addresses Defendants' antitrust Affirmative Defense and Counterclaim in section II of this Opinion and Order. 
1041,1," In accordance with the standard of review for a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), the court will present the facts as 
alleged in the second amended complaint. See infra Part II. However, the court has disregarded those portions of the complaint 
which consist of no more than legal conclusions or a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause  [**32] of action. Ashcroft v. 
Iqbal,     U.S.    , 129 S. Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009). "
1042,2," The court set forth the factual allegations in its memorandum and order dated March 4, 2009, familiarity with which is 
presumed. (See Doc. 582.)"
1042,3," Defendants are (1) The Hershey Company, (2) Hershey Canada, Incorporated, (3) Mars, Incorporated, (4) Mars Snackfood US, 
LLC, (5) Nestle USA, Incorporated, (6) Cadbury plc, (7) Cadbury  [**33] Holdings Ltd., and (8) Cadbury Adams Canada, 
Incorporated (collectively, ""defendants"")."
1042,4," As used in this memorandum, ""chocolate candy"" and ""chocolate confectionary products"" refer to chocolate bars and other 
mass-produced chocolate confections manufactured and packaged for sale to retail consumers."
1042,5," Defendants also moved to dismiss claims arising under the antitrust laws of Arizona and Nevada, but withdrew this motion after 
reaching an agreement with the IEU plaintiffs. (See Doc. 703.) In addition, defendants moved to dismiss state-law claims and 
requested relief appearing in the second amended complaint filed by the Indirect Purchaser for Resale plaintiffs. (See Doc. 671.) 
This motion was withdrawn after the parties reached an agreement resolving their dispute. (See Doc. 703.) "
1043,6," IEU plaintiffs argue that defendants have waived the right to seek dismissal of the Massachusetts, Nevada, and New 
Hampshire consumer protection claims because they did not move to dismiss these state-law actions in their original motion to 
dismiss the  [**38] consolidated amended complaint. However, the IEU plaintiffs' second amended complaint supersedes the 
consolidated amended complaint, Snyder v. Pascack Valley Hosp., 303 F.3d 271, 276 (3d Cir. 2002); see also 6 CHARLES A. 
WRIGHT ET AL., FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE § 1476, at 556 (2d ed. 1990), which allows defendants to raise substantive 
arguments in a new responsive pleading irrespective of whether those contentions were raised in response to the consolidated 
amended complaint, see In re Parmalat Sec. Litig., 421 F. Supp. 2d 703, 713 (S.D.N.Y. 2006). "
1045,7," The IEU plaintiffs invite the court to defer ruling on this issue until class certification proceedings commence, but the court 
declines this invitation. In its March 4, 2009 memorandum,  [**45] the court deferred ruling on whether the IEU plaintiffs and the 
Indirect Purchaser for Resale plaintiffs could pursue claims under the statutes of states in which no putative class representative 
either resides or does business. (See Doc. 582 at 64-66.) As explained in the court's memorandum, deferral of this standing 
issue is appropriate because the plaintiffs' capacity to represent individuals from other states depends upon obtaining class 
certification. (See id. at 66.) Deferral is not warranted with respect to the IEU plaintiffs' standing to bring a claim under the 
NDTPA, however, for the standing concerns would remain irrespective of whether the named Nevada plaintiffs filed their claim 
alone or as part of a class. (See id. at 65 (quoting Clark v. McDonald's Corp., 213 F.R.D. 198, 204 (D.N.J. 2003) and describing 
circumstances in which it is inappropriate to defer ruling on Article III standing issues)). The NDTPA permits a private cause of 
action to be filed by persons who are elderly or disabled. See Nev. Rev. Stat. § 598.0977. Neither Nevada plaintiff is elderly or 
disabled, nor do the IEU plaintiffs contend that certain members of their proposed class may fit this description.  [**46] Thus, the 
standing issues do not arise from plaintiffs' attempts to represent the proposed class, which renders deferral of the issue 
inappropriate. "
1046,8," Defendants also moved to dismiss the unjust enrichment claim arising under New Jersey law, which prompted the IEU plaintiffs 
to voluntarily withdraw this cause of action, (see Doc. 701 at 28 n.28, 30 n.31). "
1047,9," In addition to the arguments described above, defendants assert that Hawaii analyzes unjust enrichment ""as applying to 
circumstances of quasi-contract, as opposed to contract or tort."" (Doc. 671-3 at 28 n.11.) Defendants cite no authority, however, 
which forecloses equitable remedies for tortious harms such as those alleged by the IEU plaintiffs. Absent any such authority, 
the court will deny defendants' motion on this ground. "
1048,10," Defendants also contend that claims for unjust enrichment under Massachusetts law sound exclusively in quasi-contract rather 
than tort. However, defendants cite no authority in support of this proposition, and it is one belied by available state law, see, 
e.g., Nat'l Merch. Corp. v. Leyden, 370 Mass. 425, 348 N.E.2d 771, 775-76 (Mass. 1976) (holding that unjust enrichment claims 
arising under various ""business tort"" theories were ""well merited"")."
1048,11," In addition to the arguments above, defendants argue that a claim for unjust enrichment sounds exclusively in quasi-contract 
rather than tort. This contention is not supported by the case law proffered  [**57] by defendants, however, see Wingert & 
Assocs., Inc. v. Paramount Apparel Int'l, Inc., No. Civ. 03-6451ADMAJB, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11040, 2005 WL 1355028, at *5 
(D. Minn. June 7, 2005) (stating that ""[u]njust enrichment claims are typically 'quasi-contract' claims"" (emphasis added)), and the 
court will therefore reject it, see, e.g., Witt v. John Blomquist, Inc., 249 Minn. 32, 81 N.W.2d 265, 266-67 (Minn. 1957) (permitting 
plaintiff to seek damages in tort or contract to recoup defendant's unjust enrichment). "
1049,12," According to defendants, claims for unjust enrichment under Nebraska law are analyzed exclusively under principles of quasi-
contract, as opposed to tort. Again, defendants' contention is belied by relevant authority, see, e.g., Henkle & Joyce Hardware 
Co. v. Maco, Inc., 195 Neb. 565, 239 N.W.2d 772, 777 (Neb. 1976) (discussing availability of unjust enrichment remedies to 
various ""business torts""), and is therefore rejected."
1049,13," Defendants argue that an unjust enrichment claim under Nevada sounds exclusively in quasi-contract, but fail to provide case 
law which supports such a contention. This argument will therefore be rejected. "
1051,14," Defendants also argue that New York courts analyze unjust enrichment claims exclusively under principles of quasi-contract. 
This is incorrect and unsupported by the authority provided by defendants. See, e.g., Mfrs. Hanover Trust, 160 A.D.2d at 117-18 
(explaining that ""courts will look to see if a benefit has been conferred on the defendant under mistake of fact or law, if the 
benefit still remains with the defendant, if there has been otherwise a change of position by the defendant, and whether the 
defendant's conduct was tortious or fraudulent"" (quoting Paramount Film Distrib., 285 N.E.2d at 698))."
1051,15," In addition, defendants seek dismissal of the unjust enrichment claim because North Carolina purportedly analyzes such a 
cause of action exclusively under quasi-contract principles. According to the North Carolina Supreme Court, an unjust 
enrichment action ""is  [**68] neither in tort nor contract but is described as a claim in quasi contract or a contract implied in law."" 
Booe v. Shadrick, 322 N.C. 567, 369 S.E.2d 554, 556 (N.C. 1998). This characterization does not merit dismissal of the IEU 
plaintiffs' equitable claim; it is simply an alternate means of conceptualizing the equitable claim. As the Booe court went on to 
explain, an unjust enrichment action ""is not based on a promise but is imposed by law to prevent unjust enrichment. . . . [T]he 
measure of damages for unjust enrichment is the reasonable value of the goods and services to the defendant."" Id. In short, 
North Carolina's characterization of an unjust enrichment action is not materially different from the manner in which other states 
characterize the equitable claim, and defendants have provided no authority indicating that a claim for unjust enrichment under 
North Carolina law must fail when it is based upon antitrust overcharges. "
1052,16," Defendants also argue that West Virginia exclusively analyzes unjust enrichment claims under principles of quasi-contract 
 [**71] rather than tort. Defendants cite to no authority, however, indicating that an equitable claim under West Virginia does not 
encompass the purported overcharges recouped by defendants at the IEU plaintiffs' expense. Thus, the court will reject 
defendants' invitation to dismiss the West Virginia claim on this ground. "
1094,1," For purposes of clarity, the complaint in the original Air Cargo MDL will be referred to as the FCAC, while the 2010 Class Action 
Complaint against the new defendants will be referred to as the complaint or the Benchmark complaint. The moving defendants 
herein will thus be referred to as the Benchmark defendants."
1094,2," The named co-conspirators are essentially the defendants in the Air Cargo FCAC, and include Air Canada, AC Cargo LP, 
Société Air France (""Air France""), Koninklijke Luchtvaart Maatschappij N.V. (""KLM""), Aerolíneas Brasileiras S.A. d/b/a ABSA 
Cargo Airline, Alitalia Linee Aeree Italiane S.p.A., All [*111]  Nippon Airways Co., Ltd., Asiana Airlines Inc., British Airways, 
Cargolux Airlines International S.A., Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd., Air China Limited d/b/a Air China, Air China Cargo Company 
Limited d/b/a Air China Cargo, DAS Air Ltd. d/b/a DAS Air Cargo, Deutsche Lufthansa AG, Lufthansa Cargo AG, Swiss 
International Air Lines Ltd., El Al Israel Airlines, Ltd., Emirates Airlines d/b/a Emirates, Japan Airlines International Company 
Ltd.,, Korean Air Lines Co., Ltd., LAN Airlines S.A., LAN Cargo S.A., Martinair, Air New Zealand Limited d/b/a Airways New 
Zealand, Nippon Cargo Airlines Co., Ltd., Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings, Inc., Polar Air Cargo, Inc., Qantas Airways Limited 
(""Qantas""), Saudi Arabian Airlines, Ltd., Scandinavian Airlines System Group (""SAS""), SAS Cargo, Singapore Airlines Limited, 
Singapore Airlines Cargo Pte Ltd, South African Airways (Proprietary) Limited, Thai Airways International Public Co., Ltd., and 
Viação Aérea Rio-Grandense, S.A. All of the named co-conspirators conduct international air freight services, including in the 
United States and the Eastern District of New York. See Complaint, ¶¶ 44-88. Of the defendants named in the Air Cargo FCAC, "
1095,," three African [*112]  companies have been omitted from the list of co-conspirators: Air Mauritius Ltd., Ethiopian Airlines Corp., 
and Kenya Airways Limited."
1095,3," The complaint defines yield as ""revenues per ton-mile."" Yield is calculated by dividing operating revenues by the product of 
actual revenue tons and miles flown. Complaint ¶ 11."
1095,4," This is the sort of allegation about specific meetings or communications that has been included in the Benchmark complaint, 
but is absent from the FCAC. "
1097,5," Guilty pleas have now been entered [*119]  by 15 different airlines (Air France, KLM, Asiana, British Airways, Cargolux, Cathay 
Pacific, El Al, Japan Airlines, Korean Air, LAN Cargo, ABSA, Martinair, Nippon Cargo Airlines, Qantas, and SAS), and by 3 
individuals (non-moving Benchmark defendants) who worked for Martinair, Qantas, and British Airways. See Complaint, ¶¶ 97-
113. "
1100,6," Significantly, while the Benchmark complaint for the most part makes collective allegations with respect to ""the defendants"" 
and/or the ""named co-conspirators,"" almost all of the corporate co-conspirators that entered guilty pleas are alleged by name (in 
the additional Benchmark factual [*130]  details), at least at some point, to have engaged in specific meetings and discussions 
with the defendants and certain co-conspirators. Thus, while the Benchmark defendants are correct that the guilty pleas on the 
part of co-conspirators do not establish liability for them, the pleas do raise the inference that they engaged in a plausible 
conspiracy."
1100,7," In a footnote in my prior report and recommendation in Air Cargo, I wrote that I found those allegations indistinguishable from 
the conclusory allegations in the Elevator Litigation. See 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 107882, 2008 WL 5958061, at *7 n.8. Since the 
court ultimately determined that the allegations in the FCAC were not so conclusory as to warrant dismissal, in light of the 
additional factual details pleaded in the Benchmark complaint, including the additional guilty pleas, the Benchmark complaint is 
readily distinguishable from both the FCAC and the Elevator complaint. "
1101,8," EVA notes that the plaintiffs did not make any meaningful attempt to distinguish Arista Records and Vladmir. The court has, 
however, and finds both of them readily distinguishable. The favorable language in Arista concerned [*137]  counterclaims, and 
the court was solely considering at that point whether to grant leave to amend the pleadings, having already determined on other "
1102,," grounds that the counterclaims should be dismissed for failure to allege a plausible conspiracy. See 532 F. Supp. 2d at 585. 
Therefore, having had the benefit of extensive discovery, and having already amended the counterclaims once before, the court 
found that leave to amend would be futile, but in any case did not prevent the counter-claimants from moving to amend if they 
alleged additional facts. See id. The counterclaims failed because they did not allege a plausible conspiracy; the court was not 
requiring a different pleading standard in light of the discovery obtained, and did not provide any authority for that proposition. 
Here, the court has already determined that the complaint alleged a plausible conspiracy, and the Benchmark complaint only 
pleads with greater specificity than does the prior complaint. Vladimir is also inapposite, as there, the fraud claim, already 
amended once, was dismissed because of a failure to plead with particularity. See 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3823, 1997 WL 
151330, at *7. While the court did chastise the plaintiff's counsel in light of having been in possession of the defendant's [*138]  
work papers for three years and the extensive discovery obtained, the court dismissed the claim on the basis of ""alternative fact 
pleading,"" which did not satisfy the heightened pleading requirements under Rule 9(b). See id. As this complaint sounds in 
antitrust violations and not fraud, the requirements of alleging fraud with particularity are not applicable, except with regard to 
fraudulent concealment. And Vladimir dismissed the fraud claim for failing to comply with Rule 9(b), not because possession of 
extensive records required any additional particularized factual allegation to meet Rule 9(b)'s requirements. See id. "
1103,9," Sanfilippo is not linked, via specific facts alleged, to any of the individuals who were charged criminally, so the court should be 
cautious about inferring too much from those prosecutions. They do, however, provide some context for inferring, in combination 
with the specific allegations against Sanfilippo, that he joined the conspiracy and may be held liable for it. "
1106,10," The plaintiffs' ability to show that fraudulent concealment should toll the statute of limitations may also have an effect on the 
scope of any recovery available to the plaintiffs in the master MDL, whose damages might have begun to accrue prior to 2002, 
the beginning of the limitations period in those cases. "
1107,11," It is irrelevant for the Benchmark defendants that the fraudulent concealment allegations in large part rely on the 
announcements made by other members of the conspiracy, as the acts of co-conspirators are imputed to other co-conspirators. 
See Vitamins, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7397, 2000 WL 1475705, at *3 (quoting Riddell v. Riddell Washington Corp., 866 F.2d 
1480, 1493, 275 U.S. App. D.C. 362 (D.C. Cir. 1989); Pinney Dock & Transport Co. v. Penn Central Corp., 991 F. Supp. 908, 
911 (N.D. Ohio 1998). "
1108,12," The Court was considering fraudulent concealment in a civil RICO context, but made clear that the same standard applies to 
antitrust cases, and in fact, the Court referred to antitrust authorities as justification for its position. See Klehr, 521 U.S. at 194-
95."
1108,13," Hinds County, Miss. v. Wachovia Bank N.A. (""Hinds I"") recognized that case law on the due diligence element of fraudulent 
concealment has not been terribly consistent in what is required. See 620 F. Supp. 2d 499, 521 (S.D.N.Y. 2009). "
1109,14," At the same time, this argument is somewhat undercut by allegations elsewhere in the complaint that similar fuel surcharge 
pricing systems ""if independently implemented in a competitive market, would have been the foundation for the timing and 
amount of upward or downward pricing movements triggered by multiple factors, including spot fuel prices."" Complaint ¶133. In 
other words, this suggests that ""pricing shifts would not have occurred uniformly,"" which is at odds with the lockstep surcharge 
increases. Memorandum of Law in Support of Malaysia Airlines' Motion to Dismiss the Class Action Complaint, dated May 14, 
2010, at 14. To dismiss on the basis of this inconsistency, however, seems unwise. "
1110,15," One court has stated that the ""issue is not whether named Plaintiffs exercised due diligence, as named Plaintiffs argue, but 
rather whether they have pled fraudulent concealment with particularity."" Hinds I, 620 F. Supp. 2d at 521 (citing Publication 
Paper, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19896, 2005 WL 2175139, at *6 n.7). While that statement is true, the issues and facts required 
for both determinations are intimately bound together."
1110,16," Any contention that the complaint is so lacking in particularity as to deprive the defendants of effective notice of the claim is 
clearly belied by the face of the complaint, which devotes 23 paragraphs exclusively to the issue of fraudulent concealment. See 
Vitamins, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7397, 2000 WL 1475705, at *2 (""In essence, HN22[
] the rules only require that the 
'circumstances of fraud be pled with enough particularity to put the party on notice as to the nature of the claim.'"") (quoting J.C. 
Wyckoff & Assoc., Inc. v. Standard Fire Ins. Co., 936 F.2d 1474, 1489 (6th Cir. 1991)). It cannot be credibly maintained that the 
defendants are not on notice of the nature of the claim, and in evaluating whether plaintiffs have pleaded with the requisite 
particularity, courts should bear in mind the function and purpose of the heightened pleading standard."
1110,17," Resolution of the government tolling issue may also have ramifications on damages, because if the plaintiffs' argument is 
accepted by the court, they would be able to recover for injuries sustained during the entire four-year period that preceded the 
filing of the first information on August 1, 2007. Therefore, if the limitations period has been continuously tolled since that date, 
the damages period would extend back to August 1, 2003. "
1112,18," Maricopa [*176]  did mention as a caveat that if more than one year had elapsed after the criminal proceedings had 
terminated and only then had the government initiated its civil enforcement action under the Sherman Act, the tolling provision 
would not have served to resuscitate an already ""moribund"" claim, that is, a claim already barred by the statute of limitations. 
See 303 F. Supp. at 86. That, however, is not what occurred here, for there has not been a gap where the suspension period 
was not active either by the pendency of a case or by the one-year post-resolution window. Since the initiation of criminal 
proceedings in August 2007, there has always been an action pending, or one that had been pending within one year prior. And 
while the informations have all resulted in guilty pleas, the case against Lilliebourg has not yet been resolved and is still pending. "
1114,19," The text of the two agreements is for all intents and purposes, [*184]  identical. "
1116,20," The plaintiffs rely on two cases, neither of which is especially useful in resolving this issue. In Laker Airways Ltd. v. Sabena, 
Belgian World Airlines, 731 F.2d 909, 932, 235 U.S. App. D.C. 207 (D.C. Cir. 1984), foreign airlines ""ha[d] no claim to antitrust 
immunity under their air service treaties,"" but those defendants did not even argue that they were accorded such immunity. In 
Airline Pilots Association, International, AFL-CIO v. Taca International Airlines, S.A., 748 F.2d 965, 968-69 (5th Cir. 1984), the 
court was ""not persuaded that the parties to the Air Transportation Agreement intended that a dispute between private parties . . 
. was to be arbitrable under the agreement's provisions"" or that they intended the ATA to supersede the statute at issue. That 
case, however, involved a different ATA, different provisions, different underlying conduct, and a different statute, the Railway 
Labor Act. "
1117,21," HN31[
] Under the Constitution, the adoption of foreign policy is more the province of the Executive and Congress. See, e.g., Oetjen v. Central Leather Co., 246 U.S. 297, 302, 38 S. Ct. 309, 62 L. Ed. 726 (1918). The primacy of the other branches of 
government in this domain cautions against excessive judicial action that will upset the constitutional structures governing 
foreign relations. See, e.g., Liu v. Republic of China, 892 F.2d 1419, 1431 (9th Cir. 1987) (citing authorities). In National 
Coalition Government of the Union of Burma v. Unocal, Inc., the court explained how the justification for the doctrine has shifted 
over time from international comity towards separation of powers. See 176 F.R.D. 329, 349 (C.D. Cal. 1997); see also W.S. 
Kirkpatrick & Co., Inc. v. Environmental Tectonics Corp., 493 U.S. 400, 404-05, 110 S. Ct. 701, 107 L. Ed. 2d 816 (1990). "
1119,22," HN33[
] The act of state doctrine should not be confused with the concept of sovereign immunity, which bestows on foreign 
states immunity from the jurisdiction of United States courts unless certain statutory exceptions apply. See 28 U.S.C. § 1604 et 
seq. There are, however, some considerations common to both, inasmuch as the act of state doctrine arose from matters of 
international comity and foreign sovereignty. See Alfred Dunhill, 425 U.S. at 695-706; cf. International Association of Machinists 
v. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, 649 F.2d 1354, 1360 (9th Cir. 1981) (""[T]he act of state doctrine and the 
doctrine of sovereign immunity address different concerns and apply in different circumstances.""). Since 1952, the United States 
has taken a ""restrictive"" approach to sovereign immunity, such that a ""commercial exception"" exists whereby ""immunity is 
confined to suits involving the foreign sovereign's public acts, and does not extend to cases arising out of a foreign state's strictly 
commercial acts."" Verlinden, B.V. v. Central Bank of Nigeria, 461 U.S. 480, 487, 103 S. Ct. 1962, 76 L. Ed. 2d 81 (1983); see 
also 28 U.S.C. § 1604 et seq.; Republic of Argentina v. Weltover, Inc., 504 U.S. 607, 611-14, 112 S. Ct. 2160, 119 L. Ed. 2d 394 
(1992) Verlinden, 461 U.S. at 486-90; De Letelier v. Republic of Chile, 748 F.2d 790, 795-97 (2d Cir. 1984). This principle was codified in HN34[
] the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (the ""FSIA""), which does not grant 
immunity for an action ""based upon a commercial activity carried on in the United States by the foreign [*204]  state; or upon an 
act performed in the United States in connection with a commercial activity of a foreign state elsewhere; or upon an act outside 
the territory of the United States in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state elsewhere and that act causes a 
direct effect in the United States[.]"" 28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(2). Elsewhere, the FSIA defines ""commercial activity"" as ""either a 
regular course of commercial conduct or a particular commercial transaction or act. The commercial character of an activity shall 
be determined by reference to the nature of the course of conduct or particular transaction or act, rather than by reference to its 
purpose."" 28 U.S.C. § 1603(d). The concept of a commercial activity exception is not similarly enshrined in the act of state 
doctrine. Perhaps the most helpful way to distinguish between the two is that HN35[
] sovereign immunity is a jurisdictional 
concept, determinative of whether the court has the power to adjudicate the case or the issues involved. See OPEC, 649 F.2d at 
1359. The act of state doctrine, as a prudential concept, determines whether a court should exercise jurisdiction once it has 
been established. Thus, merely because a court may not be barred from hearing a particular case does not [*205]  establish that 
the court ought to, in every case, adjudicate the issues presented to it."
1119,23," The Second Circuit has neither explicitly adopted nor explicitly rejected the Dunhill plurality's proposed commercial activity 
exception, nor has it drawn as sharp a distinction between a sovereign's public, governmental acts on the one hand, and its 
private, commercial acts on the other. See, e.g., Republic of Philippines v. Marcos, 806 F.2d 344, 358-59 (2d Cir. 1986); Braka 
v. Bancomer, S.N.C., 762 F.2d 222, 225 (2d Cir. 1985) (leaving ""for another day"" whether to adopt Dunhill's commercial activity 
exception). "
1120,24," The quotation from Kirkpatrick is accurate, as far as the court is aware, because it was referring to Supreme Court cases on 
the act of state doctrine, rather than lower court cases that have applied it to a sovereign's commercial activities. The court is 
unaware of a Supreme Court decision that barred inquiry into purely commercial activity because of the act of state 
doctrine. [*210] "
1121,25," But see Kruman v. Christie's Intern. PLC, 129 F. Supp. 2d 620, 627 (S.D.N.Y. 2001), affirmed in part and vacated in part by 
284 F.3d 384 (2d Cir. 2002) (finding ""no substantial support for the proposition that there is an international consensus 
proscribing price fixing that fairly might be characterized as customary international law, much less an international consensus 
that price fixing gives rise to tort claims on behalf of victims.""). There, however, Judge Kaplan was analyzing whether price-fixing 
claims could be brought under the Alien Tort Claims Act, that is, whether that conduct violates the law of nations or customary 
international law. See id.; see also 28 U.S.C. § 1350. "
1126,1," Several former defendants have also filed motions for leave to respond to plaintiffs' request to depose their employees. (Mots. 
for Leave to Respond [649], [651], and [652].) Those motions are moot as a result of the Court's order granting plaintiffs' request 
to take the depositions. (Order [663].) "
1127,2," This Court recently denied a motion for class certification in an employment case on similar grounds. Luna v. Del Monte Fresh 
Produce (Southeast), Inc., 354 Fed. Appx. 422, 424 (11th Cir. 2009). "
1130,1," Courts use the terms ""market power"" and ""monopoly power"" interchangeably. See, e.g. Cost Mgmt. Services v. Washington 
Natural Gas Co., 99 F.3d 937, 950 n. 15 (9th Cir. 1996). "
1131,2," Because claims under California code § 16720 ""raise essentially the same issues as do Sherman Act Claims.,"" McGlinchy, 845 
F.2d at 812 n. 4, the court is also inclined to deny Mead's motion with respect to § 16720. "
1134,1," Except where otherwise indicated, the  [*2] ""Background"" facts are undisputed."
1134,2," Defendant's responsive papers do not comply with the requirements set forth in Local Rule 7.1(a). Specifically, in response to 
Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, Defendant failed to submit a memorandum of law and a response to Plaintiff's 
statement of material facts. Defendant merely filed a brief attorney affirmation and an affidavit of its president, along with several 
exhibits. The Court advises Defendant that its failure to controvert the facts that Plaintiff set forth  [*4] in its statement of material 
facts carries significant consequences. See Local Rule 7.1(a)(3) (providing that ""[t]he Court shall deem admitted any facts set 
forth in the Statement of Material Facts that the opposing party does not specifically controvert""). "
1136,3," In its answer, Defendant ""[d]enies each and every allegation contained in paragraph II [of the Complaint]."" See Dkt. No. 33. 
Paragraph II of the  [*9] Complaint is the claim for relief in which Plaintiff asserts that ""Defendant owes plaintiff the sum of 
$1,291,580.63 for goods sold and delivered to the defendant at its request prior to June 1, 2008."" See Dkt. No. 1. This is the only 
instance where Defendant specifically denies its liability. When read in conjunction with its other filings, however, this statement 
is merely an assertion that the amount Defendant owes should be offset by any amount awarded pursuant to its counterclaims 
and affirmative defenses. See Dkt. No. 54, at ¶ 5 (stating that ""[t]he fact is that if the court grants the plaintiff's motion for 
summary judgment the financial burden will effectively destroy the defendant and it will have no opportunity to litigate its 
counterclaims. If the plaintiff's motion is denied the defendant will, at least, have the opportunity to prove its case and offset any 
obligations that it might have to the plaintiff""). "
1139,4," Price discrimination claims are classified as ""primary line,"" ""secondary line,"" and ""tertiary line."" ""Primary-line cases entail 
conduct — most conspicuously, predatory pricing — that injures competition at the  [*21] level of the discriminating seller and its 
direct competitors."" Volvo Trucks N. Am., Inc., 546 U.S. at 176 (citations omitted). A secondary-line price discrimination claim, 
which Defendant asserts here, is a claim where the allegedly injured party is in competition with a favored customer of the same 
seller. See George Haug Co., Inc. v. Rolls Royce Motor Cars Inc., 148 F.3d 136, 141 n.2 (2d Cir. 1998) (citation omitted). 
""Tertiary-line cases involve injury to competition at the level of the purchaser's customers."" Volvo Trucks N. Am., Inc., 546 U.S. 
at 176 (citation omitted). "
1140,5," Although the Fifth Circuit's acknowledgment of the Two-Purchaser Rule in Hartley seems to contradict its holding in Bruce's 
Juices, the court in Hartley did not address the bidder-purchaser distinction; and, therefore, Hartley and Bruce's Juices are 
distinguishable. "
1142,6," In its response, Defendant only argues that it has properly stated a cause of action for breaches of the implied warranty of 
merchantability and the implied warranty of fitness. Accordingly, the Court will only address whether Defendant alleged facts 
sufficient to establish either of these causes of action. "
1143,7," Although the Court is granting Defendant leave to move to amend this counterclaim, it is skeptical about Defendant's ability to 
establish the requisite elements. Based on the facts provided, it is unclear whether Defendant, as a middleman, can establish 
that Plaintiff knew or had reason to know of the particular purpose for which the goods were required. "
1144,8," The Court directs Defendant's attention to Local Rule 7.1(a)(4) for the proper form and procedure for filing a motion to amend a 
pleading; in particular, the Court notes the requirement that a party moving to amend ""must attach an unsigned copy of the 
proposed amended pleading to its motion papers."" L.R. 7.1(a)(4). "
1146,1," Plaintiff does not appeal from that part of the February 25, 2004 order that dismissed the prima facie tort claim. "
1147,2," We shall hereinafter refer to the radius clause and site specific clause as ""radius clause."""
1147,3," Plaintiff relied on hearsay evidence to support its threats and intimidation claim; however, such evidence cannot defeat 
summary judgment. R. 1:6-6; R. 4:46-5(a). "
1149,4," See United Mine Workers of Am. v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 669-70, 85 S. Ct. 1585, 1593, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626, 636 (1965); 
E.R.R. Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 139-40, 81 S. Ct. 523, 530-31, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464, 472 
(1961). "
1165,1," Defendant GAC brought a motion to dismiss [339] that has since been rendered moot by its motion for summary judgment. 
Therefore, Defendant GAC's motion to dismiss is DENIED as MOOT."
1165,2," PVS Nolwood Chemicals, Inc. and PVS Chemicals, Inc. Ohio are also parties to this action. For purposes of this motion the 
three PVS-related companies will be referred to collectively as ""PVS."""
1165,3," Several parties have chosen to disregard this Court's standing order and Rule 56's purpose of increasing the efficiency of these 
proceedings by providing argument, disputed facts, and inaccurate/insufficient citation in their statements of facts. Plaintiffs' 
statement of fact especially  [**5] suffers from such conduct. As stated in its standing order, the Court shall not consider 
inappropriate arguments presented in the parties' Rule 56.1 statements. "
1179,4," Prior to Korean Air, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation and some district courts assumed that Van Dusen 
 [**47] applied to federal claims. See, e.g., In re Plumbing Fixtures Litigation, 342 F. Supp. 756, 758 (J.P.M.L. 1972) (in an 
antitrust case, ""[i]t is clear that the substantive law of the transferor forum will apply after transfer""); In re Dow Co. Sarabond 
Products Liability Litigation, 666 F. Supp. 1466, 1468 (D. Colo. 1987) (citing district court cases). Since Korean Air issued in 
1987, courts seem to have abandoned this position."
1179,5," Other circuits have adopted the same position. See Newton v. Thomason, 22 F.3d 1455, 1460 (9th Cir. 1994) (""[W]hen 
reviewing federal claims, a transferee court in this circuit is bound only by our circuit's precedent.) Bradley v. United States, 161 
F.3d 777, 782 (4th Cir. 1998)(""[T]his court cannot and does not apply the law of another circuit simply because the case was 
transferred from the other circuit.""). "
1181,6," Because Plaintiffs filed their suits in 2003, the statute of limitations could not have accrued any earlier than 1999, if Plaintiffs 
acted in a timely manner. Boliden does not argue that Plaintiffs ever gained actual notice of anticompetitive  [**54] activities."
1181,7," Plaintiffs contend that the explicit and implicit terms of Defendants' agreements, submitted in the instant case as evidence of 
anticompetitive behavior, remained confidential and inaccessible. The Court notes that internal documents used by some 
Plaintiffs to craft their claims came to light when a Canadian court unsealed them in mid-2003. That litigation was required to 
produce these records further discourages the Court from concluding that, as a matter of law, a reasonably diligent 
 [**56] plaintiff could have uncovered Defendants' alleged misconduct absent legal action. See Glazer Steel Corp. v. 
Toyomenka, Inc., 392 F. Supp. 500, 503 (S.D.N.Y. 1974) (defendants' continual refusal to answer interrogatories during 
discovery made it ""unlikely that greater diligence on the part of the plaintiff would have uncovered the cause of action any 
sooner""). "
1183,8," Evidence that reasonably tends to prove a conspiracy among Noranda, Falconbridge, and DuPont under the umbrella of the 
Noranda DuPont Joint Venture is discussed in Section III.B.5 of this opinion."
1183,9," The revenue sharing provisions in some of Defendants' contracts is an example. Plaintiffs do not claim that contractual revenue 
sharing per se violates antitrust laws. Rather, they rely on the provisions as evidence pointing to collusive activity, for their 
capacity to  [**62] act as mechanisms through which Defendants allegedly reaped the profits of their conspiracy. While revenue 
sharing can be consistent with such usage, and may provide Defendants with added motive to cooperate with each other in 
make-buy decisions, it does not, standing alone, tend to show anticompetitive collusion. "
1184,10," Defendant Koch complains at length that none of Koch's contracts explicitly involved the shutdown of facilities or the reduction 
of production, nor is there evidence that Koch ever attended any meetings at which the overarching conspiracy was discussed. 
Yet, Plaintiffs' circumstantial evidence tends to show that negotiations beyond the scope of the written agreements informed 
Koch of the purpose and methods of the alleged conspiracy, and that Koch acted accordingly. See, e.g. Pl. Ex. 14 at 11 (1988 
Noranda report) (""Koch has expressed an interest in partial closure of both plants with particular emphasis on the Wilmington 
facility); Pl. Ex. 52 (1988 Koch memo) (""As a company, management wants production to either cease or be scaled back for 
Noranda's acid to enter the market.""); Pl. Ex. 54 at KSP00062754 (1990 Koch memo) (""Koch  [**66] could displace acid 
currently in the market with Noranda acid, so as to maintain industry structure.""); Pl. Ex. 56 at 7 (Koch Answers to 
Interrogatories) (showing a reduction in production by 25,000 tons in 1990 at the Wilmington Plant); Pl. Ex. 242 at KSP00119407 
(2005 notes by Koch employee) (""[Noranda] wondered about Wilmington facility. He felt there could be a good fit once the new 
acid plant comes on stream. I mentioned that we have considered the option and can talk in the near future."")."
1184,11," Citing In re High Fructose Corn Syrup Antitrust Litigation, Defendants seem to argue that Plaintiffs must produce a written 
contract in order to survive summary judgment. See Koch Reply Br. at 2 (citing High Fructose, 295 F.3d 651, 661 (7th Cir. 2002) 
(""[T]his evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that [defendants] had a merely tacit agreement, which at least for purposes of 
this appeal the plaintiffs concede is not actionable . . . . The question then becomes whether there is enough evidence for a 
reasonable jury to find that there was an explicit agreement, not merely a tacit one."")). But the Seventh Circuit's definition of an 
""explicit agreement"" in the context of High Fructose is ""an  [**67] actual, manifest agreement not to compete,"" which could be, 
and was, made orally. See id. at 661-62 (reversing grant of summary judgment due to evidence of an explicit agreement in the 
form of incriminating comments made by defendants, rather than a written contract)."
1184,12," In the alternative, Defendant Boliden claims that it ""withdrew"" from any conspiracy by May  [**68] 1995, when it was reported 
to be running the Copperhill plant at full capacity. Firstly, Plaintiffs dispute that Boliden began running at capacity at that time. 
See Noranda Ex. 27 at 37 (showing that Copperhill's annual output fell short of its capacity between 1993 and 1998). Secondly, 
even if Copperhill was producing at maximum levels, doing so for some period of time is not inconsistent with the overall "
1185,," conspiracy alleged by Plaintiffs. To wit, Defendants allegedly conspired to reduce output whenever supply overshadowed 
demand, so as to maintain a balanced market. Whenever supply dipped below demand, Defendants could increase production 
while still remaining true to the goals of the conspiracy. Thirdly, producing at full capacity is insufficient to alone constitute a 
withdrawal from a conspiracy. HN14[
] Withdrawal requires an affirmative act on the part of the conspirator; he must either 
make a full confession to the authorities, or communicate to each of his coconspirators that he has abandoned the conspiracy 
and its goals. See United States v. Sax, 39 F.3d 1380, 1386 (7th Cir. 1994). Defendants offer no evidence that Boliden acted 
accordingly."
1185,13," See Boliden Br. App. A-H (sample media reports of decisions by producers to close acid plants and resell Canadian smelter 
acid). In addition to extensive media coverage, there is evidence indicating an awareness among American Defendants of co-
Defendants' specific dealings with Noranda. See, e.g., Pl. Ex. 51 (Koch notes regarding shutdown of PVS plant)."
1185,14," See, e.g., Pl. Ex. 215 at PVS107692 (PVS internal letter) (""Noranda  [**71] acid is destined for the Ohio market and if we do 
not control it, someone else will. The latter would apparently result in depressed prices and make it uneconomical to operate the 
plant.""); Pl. Ex. 54 at KSP00062754 (Koch memo) (""Koch could displace acid currently in the market with Noranda acid, so as to 
maintain industry structure.""); Pl. Ex. 45 at 1-2 (Boliden-Noranda letter) (""Noranda and Boliden are in concurrence in that . . . 
'sharing the pain' is essential. . . . It is our objective . . . to pursue other opportunities such as . . . shut down agreements . . . in 
order to maximize the realizations on this tonnage.""); Pl. Ex. 28 at 2 (1991 Noranda memo) (""All parties fully support Boliden's 
strategic desire to reduce Marsulex's volume by that quantity . . . of acid anticipated (some time ago) to be displaced from 
Falconbridge's traditional Canadian sales.""). "
1186,15," See, e.g., Pl. Ex. 13 ¶ 12 (implicating Noranda); Pl. Ex. 54 at KSP00062754 (implicating Koch and Noranda); Pl. Ex. 52 
(implicating Koch); Pl. Ex. 39 at 2 (implicating Boliden and Falconbridge); Pl. Ex. 41 at 8 (implicating  [**74] Boliden and 
Falconbridge); Pl. Ex. 14 at 8, 10 (implicating PVS and Noranda); Pl. Ex. 13 at 13 (implicating PVS and Noranda); Pl. Ex. 27 at 
166784 (implicating PVS and Noranda)."
1186,16," Citing General Leaseways, Defendants urge the Court to disregard internal company documents because the reliability of their 
content is questionable. In deciding whether a plaintiff had raised a substantial question on the merits so as to warrant a 
preliminary injunction, the General Leaseways court ""attach[ed] rather little weight to internal company documents used to show 
anticompetitive intent, because, though they sometimes dazzle a jury, they cast only a dim light on what ought to be the central 
question in an antitrust case: actual or probable anticompetitive effect."" 744 F.2d at 595. Courts do not weigh evidence at 
summary judgment as they do on a motion for a preliminary injunction. At this stage, assigning weight to different pieces of 
evidence is a task reserved for factfinders. "
1187,17," Plaintiffs' allegations of a horizontal conspiracy to allocate customers lack sufficient evidentiary support and thus cannot 
survive summary judgment. See, infra, Section III.B.4. Such a claim would fail against GAC at any rate, because it did not 
compete with Noranda or Falconbridge in the production of sulfuric acid. "
1188,18," Plaintiffs briefly make an attempt to address  [**83] the issue of market power by equating the concept with Dr. Tolliver's 
assessment of market share. Yet, they do not dispute that Dr. Tolliver did not determine the geographic markets or markets at 
issue in this case. See Noranda SOF ¶ 52. "
1189,19," HN23[
] An intermediate ""quick look"" doctrine also exists for cases that do not fall in per se illegal categories, yet do not 
require elaborate industry analysis to determine their overall anticompetitive effect. Such conduct can be condemned short of full 
rule of reason analysis if ""an observer with even a rudimentary understanding of economics could conclude that the 
arrangements in question would have an anticompetitive effect on customers and markets."" Cal. Dental Ass'n v. FTC, 526 U.S. 
756, 770, 119 S. Ct. 1604, 143 L. Ed. 2d 935 (1999). Further discussion of the quick look doctrine is unnecessary where, as 
here, the per se rule may yet apply after the resolution of outstanding factual disputes. "
1192,20," Defendants paint a picture of an ""economic reality that acid produced as a by-product from smelting metals and acid produced 
from burning sulfur would not both continue to be produced in a 'balanced' market where supply already equaled demand. . . . A 
rational voluntary  [**99] producer of acid would not continue producing under these conditions."" Noranda Reply Br. at 7-8. 
Plaintiffs dispute the continued profitability of Defendants' plants, however. See Pl. Ex. 8, Hall Dep. 204:22-205:23."
1192,21," Defendants argue that the agreements produced efficiencies for Defendants' business. It is undisputed, for instance, that 
Delta's sales increased. GAC SOF ¶ 45. But whether these efficiencies came at the cost of the consumer is the key question of 
fact in this case. "
1193,22," Koch's argument that it could not have conspired to decrease production because it increased overall output by importing acid 
from Europe, as well as Noranda's defense that its smelter acid may have ultimately increased or maintained the total output of 
acid in the marketplace, thus fails under Socony-Vacuum. See Koch Reply Br. at 9; Noranda Br. at 9. Whether the overall level 
of sulfuric acid increased over time is irrelevant; it matters only whether the overall level increased at a slower rate than it would 
have without ""market manipulation."" See Socony-Vacuum, 310 U.S. at 223. "
1194,23," Generally, a finding of ancillarity works to ""remove the per se label from restraints otherwise falling within that category."" R. 
Bork, Ancillary Restraints and the Sherman Act, 15 ANTITRUST L.J. 211, 212 (1959). "
1195,24," Noranda argues that the Manderson Report represents ""prior executive . . . branch involvement,"" which serves as a ""unique 
indicator that the challenged practice may have redeeming competitive virtues and that the search for those values is not almost 
sure to be in vain."" BMI, 441 U.S. 1, 13, 99 S. Ct. 1551, 60 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1979). The Manderson Report recommended that 
Noranda distribute its by-product acid through existing U.S. producers of discretionary  [**110] acid. It was written by an outside 
consultant, retained by Noranda and the Quebec Government to make a preliminary investigation of the market opportunities for 
the proposed Horne Smelter. See Noranda Ex. 6 at 1 (Manderson Report). However, Defendants offer no evidence to support 
the notion that the Province of Quebec approved of or supported the recommendations made by the third-party report. 
Defendants fail to produce documents or depositions of any provincial authorities to that effect. The record does contain 
testimony of a Canadian federal government official, who has denied making any recommendations to Noranda about the sale of 
its sulfuric acid. See Pl. Ex. 269, Bourassa Dep. at 22:11-26:8. Even if the Province of Quebec approved of Defendants' sale 
strategy to market to producers, Defendants conflate the lawful and arms-length commercial transactions recommended by the 
Manderson Report with the allegedly collusive activity at issue here. If at all, provincial authorities would likely have approved of 
acid sales that did not involve illegal and anticompetitive output restriction terms. Defendants' alleged conspiracy is not afforded 
procompetitive effects by virtue of the Manderson  [**111] Report."
1195,25," To illustrate the uniqueness of the sulfuric acid industry, Defendants cite a Canadian case holding that voluntary producer's 
decision to shut down facilities in favor of an exclusive resale contract with a smelter did not violate Canadian antitrust laws. See "
1196,," R. v. Allied Chem. Canada Ltd., 6 W.W.R. 481 [1975]. While legal analysis under Canadian law is irrelevant, it bears noting that 
the British Columbia Supreme Court's holding was not premised on the uniqueness of the sulfuric acid industry. The court 
actually based its decision on findings of fact that this Court is prevented from making at summary judgment. The 
 [**114] Canadian court observed, ""[c]ertainly there are cases where control and diminution of supply may be a weapon to 
control price. . . . But here the problem was to dispose of an excess of acid, not to dry the source of supply. . . . There was no 
suggestion that the plan was to shut down [the plant] so [the smelter] could control the price of acid, nor is there any evidence 
that any overt acts to that end did result."" Id. at ¶ 125-26. The court ultimately found that ""[t]here was no initial illegal agreement 
to limit all facilities in the western British Columbia area to those at [the smelter], and there was no ongoing policy to do so, nor 
any overt action directed to carrying out such a policy."" Id. at ¶ 137. By contrast, it remains disputed whether the instant case 
involves illegal agreements comprising an ongoing conspiracy to reduce output as a means of influencing prices. "
1197,26," Intrabrand vertical restraints threaten interbrand competition only if the supplier has monopoly power in the relevant market. 
See O.S.C. Corp. v. Apple Computer, Inc., 601 F. Supp. 1274, 1291 n. 8 (C.D. Cal. 1985), aff'd, 792 F.2d 1464 (9th Cir. 1986). 
For this reason, the rule of reason is required to assess their legality. Given that vertical restraints can produce market 
efficiencies, it cannot be stated with any degree of confidence  [**118] they ""always or almost always tend to restrict competition 
and decrease output,"" Business Electronics, 485 U.S. at 723. In other words, the possibility of procompetitive effects precludes 
per se treatment."
1197,27," Although Plaintiffs do not dispute this in their response to Falconbridge's statement of facts, they cursorily suggest in their brief 
that the contracts restricted the areas in which Falconbridge acid could be resold. In support of this position, Plaintiffs cite 
without explanation an internal Noranda email. See Pl. Ex. 78. The email describes a request for sulfuric acid from a potential 
Wisconsin customer. The Noranda employee taking the order writes that ""[t]he acid must come from the Horne [Noranda's 
smelter] because only Marsulex can sell Falconbridge in this zone and Marsulex is not my customer."" Pl. Ex. 189; see also Pl. 
Ex. 77 at NFD197665 (map indicating that Wisconsin was in Marsulex's ""zone""). When viewed in the light most favorable to 
Plaintiffs, this email at most establishes that the zone contracts granted Falconbridge acid distributors an exclusive right to 
purchase and sell Falconbridge acid in their given zone, while Noranda acid (i.e. from the Horne smelter) could  [**120] be freely 
sold to customers outside that pool. The effect of the distinction is minimal. Such a vertical restraint on Falconbridge acid sales 
would remain subject to the rule of reason under GTE Sylvania, 433 U.S. at 38, 58."
1197,28," In contrast to the evidence reasonably tending to prove Defendants' participation in an output limitation conspiracy, Plaintiffs' 
have failed to submit comparable evidence suggesting the existence of a horizontal market allocation conspiracy. See Monsanto 
465 U.S. at 764; Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 588. At best, Plaintiffs' evidence suggests a vertical market allocation arrangement. "
1198,29," HN39[
] The Supreme Court frequently looks beyond labels to condemn underlying collusion among competitors as 
violations of the Sherman Act. See American Needle, 130 S.Ct. at 2209 (""[W]e have repeatedly found instances in which 
members of a legally single entity violated § 1 when the entity was controlled by a group of competitors and served, in essence, 
as a vehicle for ongoing concerted activity.""); accord United States v. American Tobacco Co., 221 U.S. 106, 187, 31 S. Ct. 632, 
55 L. Ed. 663 (1911) (where the trust or holding company device brought together previously independent firms to lessen 
competition  [**124] and achieve monopoly power, ""the combination was in and of itself"" is a restraint of trade); see also Federal 
Trade Comm'n & U.S. Dep't of Justice, Antitrust Guidelines for Collaborations Among Competitors 9 (2000) (""[L]abeling an 
arrangement a 'joint venture' will not protect what is merely a device to raise price or restrict output . . . .""). "
1199,30," In dicta, the Supreme Court speculated that ""[h]ad respondents challenged Equilon itself, they would have been required to 
show that its creation was anticompetitive under the rule of reason."" Id. This line cannot be read to mean that whether a joint 
venture amounts to a sham must be analyzed under the rule of reason. Such an interpretation does not square with existing 
Supreme Court precedent. See P. Areeda & H. Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law ¶ 2132, p. 387 (Supp. 2010) (""[W]e would not read 
too much into the decision's dicta."")."
1199,31," Given Equilon's legal pedigree and high level of integration, subsequent applications of the ""single entity"" principle indicate 
that Dagher should be interpreted narrowly. See, e.g., American Needle, Inc. v. National Football League, 130 S.Ct. 2201, 2215, 
176 L. Ed. 2d 947 (2010) (despite operating under separate management, corporation established by the NFL to exclusively 
license the teams' trademarks was not a ""single entity"" for antitrust purposes, since the constituent teams did not function like 
components of a single firm maximizing the firm's profits); Starr v. Sony BMG Music Entertainment, 592 F.3d 314, 326 (2d Cir. 
2010) (holding that Dagher does not apply  [**128] in a case where plaintiffs challenged joint venture as a sham and the joint 
venture was not explicitly approved by state or federal regulators); P. Areeda & H. Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law ¶ 2132, p. 387 
(Supp. 2010) (""[O]ne should not overread the opinion. . . . This particular joint venture came very close to being a full merger of 
the two firms . . . Other ventures integrate far less.""). "
1200,32," The Supreme Court did not elaborate on the basis for its holding. Most likely, the Court condemned the joint venture as a per 
se violation because, from the start, it held no reasonable prospect of delivering efficiency-enhancing  [**130] benefits to society. 
The Court found that ""[t]he purpose of the agreement was to end any business or commercial competition between the two 
papers,"" and that defendants lacked a viable defense for their actions. In effect, despite the integration of assets, the joint 
venture was a sham. Citizen Publishing, 394 U.S. at 134, 136-37."
1200,33," Defendants suggest that any possibly legitimate venture encompassing the alleged anticompetitive behavior requires that the 
rule of reason test be applied. However, as this Court interprets the law, it is only plausible connections to legitimate business 
motivations that urge against applying per se analysis to what would otherwise be clearly anticompetitive behavior. And whether 
or not Noranda, DuPont, and Falconbridge's collaboration plausibly promoted competition or market efficiency is exactly what is 
at issue here"
1200,34," Overall, Defendants tend to analyze separately evidence in support of anticompetitive deals made with Noranda prior to 1998 
and those made with Noranda DuPont, LLC thereafter. The Court declines to decide how long, if at all, the alleged conspiracy 
lasted, and which specific plant shutdowns it entailed. If the Noranda DuPont joint venture is found to be an extension of existing 
concerted action, the temporal distinction posed by Defendants may be rendered moot. It is up to a factfinder to determine 
whether the dealings of Defendants Koch, PVS, and Boliden with Noranda DuPont LLC form part of a conspiracy that existed 
prior to the formation of the Joint Venture. "
1201,35," DuPont claims that its decision to scale back production was unilateral, but the issue is disputed. Plaintiffs have produced 
evidence implying that DuPont acted at the direction of the Joint Venture. See Pl. Ex. 122, at ND00087153."
1201,36," The undisputed record also establishes that profits of the Joint Venture were split evenly between Noranda and DuPont, and 
that both companies shared the Joint Venture's losses. Norfalco SOF ¶ 34. Given the questionable history between the joint 
venturers in this case, the Court hesitates to read too much into the sharing of profits and risks. HN41[
] ""If the fact that potential competitors shared in profits or losses from a venture meant that the venture was immune from § 1, then any cartel 
'could evade the antitrust law simply by creating a 'joint venture' to serve as the exclusive seller of their competing products.'"" 
See American Needle, 130 S.Ct. at 2215 (quoting Major League Baseball Properties, Inc. v. Salvino, Inc., 542 F.3d 290, 335 (2d 
Cir. 2008) (Sotomayor, J., concurring)). "
1204,37," Although Noranda acted as Falconbridge's exclusive sales agent for seven years, it appears that, within this relationship, the 
companies retained competing interests. See Pl. Ex. 272 at NFD172546 (""Falconbridge pointed out that  [**148] it felt it had a 
disproportionate allocation of 'distant' customers relative to Noranda during the preceding 3 years, and that if Noranda had been 
pooling with Falconbridge its average freight cost would be lower. . . .""). "
1207,1," Also according to Mayer, the largest selling brand of condom in the United States is Trojan, which with other C&D condoms 
account for over 75% of all retail condom sales. The next is Durex brand, marketed by SSL Americas, Inc., with approximately 
15.3%, and the third is Lifestyle brand, marketed by Ansell Healthcare with approximately 7.7%. In sum, condoms sold by these 
three companies account for over 98% of the condom market. Mayer Decl., PP 12-15."
1207,2," Mayer estimates that due to C&D's anti-competitive practices, Mayer's condom sales have declined from $1.95 million in 2005 
to $1.50 million in 2008. Mayer Decl., P 5. "
1208,3," The Court further notes that, on February 5, 2010, C&D submitted a surreply to chambers. For some reason, this surreply was 
not filed on ECF or recorded on the docket. Because the arguments in the surreply do not alter the Court's analysis, the Court 
 [*9] will consider it. Its arguments will be specifically referenced where appropriate. "
1209,4," Indeed, in Crown Cork & Seal Co. v. USW, No. 03-CV-1381, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 760 (W.D. Pa. 2004), a case cited by 
Mayer, that court acknowledged that courts abstain from hearing declaratory judgment actions where there is a pending state or 
federal court action. Id. at *8. "
1212,5," The Court concludes that the Northern District of California is a ""less favorable forum"" for C&D because C&D argues in 
connection with its opposition to the motion to transfer that the Northern District of California is an inconvenient forum. "
1213,6, Jansen's Declaration disputes making such a statement. Jansen Decl. PP 2-4.
1213,7," In its surreply, C&D further argues that its filing is not anticipatory because Jansen did not set a date certain in his letter 
attached to the draft complaint. C&D points to Maximum Human Perf., Inc. v. Dymatize Enterp., Inc., Civil Action 09-235, 2009 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 76994 (D.N.J. Aug. 27, 2009), in support of its argument. Maximum Human is clearly distinguishable, however, 
because the correspondence from the party threatening potential suit, in that case, provided no timeframe for the other party to 
respond. Here, by contrast, Jansen's letter explicitly set a three-week deadline. Indeed, that C&D filed its suit on that deadline 
strongly suggests that it considered the three-week deadline a date certain."
1213,8,"  The Cartwright Act is California's antitrust statute. Cases decided under the Sherman Act are applicable to interpreting the 
Cartwright Act. Indeed, the analysis  [*26] under California's antitrust law mirrors the analysis under federal law because 
the Cartwright Act was modeled after the Sherman Act. Therefore, the analysis and conclusions would be the same under 
the Cartwright Act, as under the federal claims. Stanislaus Food Products Co. v. USS-POSCO Industries, No. CV F 09-0560, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 92236, 2010 WL 3521979, 
*29 (E.D.Cal.Sept. 3, 2010) (internal citations omitted). "
1214,9," The only somewhat relevant authority this Court's research revealed is In re Automotive Refinishing Paint, supra, which 
addresses personal jurisdiction and venue in an antitrust action. That case, however, addressed those issues in connection with 
a foreign defendant and at least one court interpreting it has declined to apply its analysis to domestic defendants. See e.g., 
Howard Hess Dental Laboratories Inc. v. Dentsply Intern., Inc., 516 F.Supp.2d 324, 337-38 (D.Del. 2007)."
1214,10," While  [*28] Daniels addresses where an antitrust claim arises for venue purposes under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2), the inquiries 
under that statute and Jumara's ""where the claim arose"" factor are analogous. They both ask: ""(1) What acts or omissions by 
defendant gave rise to plaintiff's claim? and (2) Of those acts, did a 'substantial part' of them take place in the chosen venue?"" 
Daniel, 428 F.3d at 432 (quoting Jenkins Brick Co. v. Bremer, 321 F.3d 1366, 1372 (11th Cir. 2003)) (internal brackets and 
quotation marks omitted). "
1215,11," Mayer disputes these allegations, asserting that no such meeting ever took place. In either case, the existence or non-
existence of the meeting does not alter my analysis because all the remaining claims arose in California."
1215,12," As to the Longs Drugs' employees, C&D points out that Longs' Drugs was bought out by CVS, ""which is headquartered in 
Rhode Island."" That CVS' headquarters is located in Rhode Island does not undercut Mayer's contention that it intends to call 
employees who reside in California. "
1216,13," C&D argues in its surreply that most of Mayer's documents have already been produced in New Jersey, thereby rendering 
 [*35] this factor less relevant to the Court's consideration. Because I view this factor as neutral, in any event, C&D's argument 
does not affect my analysis."
1216,14," C&D argues, in its surreply, that the matter should stay in New Jersey because discovery has progressed and because the 
suit has been mediated. While the Court appreciates that the suit has progressed in this Court, the mediation was unsuccessful 
and the discovery that has been completed will be easily transferred to the Northern District of California. To the extent that the 
 [*36] Magistrate Judge here has become familiar with the case, that Judge's role primarily relates to the limited discovery the 
parties engaged in and/or any settlement discussion. No decision on the merits has yet been made. Thus, I conclude that the 
transfer will not waste judicial resources. "
1221,1," The Washington,  [*2] D.C. area airports are Dulles International Airport (""IAD""), Reagan International Airport (""DCA""), and 
Baltimore-Washington International Airport (""BWI""). The San Francisco Bay area airports are San Francisco International Airport 
(""SFO""), Oakland International Airport (""OAK""), and San Jose International Airport (""SJC""). The route between the Washington, 
D.C. and San Francisco Bay metropolitan areas will be referred to as the ""Washington, D.C. to San Francisco route,"" regardless 
of direction of travel. "
1222,2," No opposition to United's Motion to Exclude the Testimony of Mr. Novak Niketic [#50] was ever filed, but this motion is denied 
as moot instead  [*3] of being granted as conceded because the issue is moot."
1222,3," These concessions, however, are made only for the purposes of United's summary judgment motion. They remain disputed: for 
example, United's expert claims that United's share of origin-destination passengers (i.e., passengers  [*5] not connecting in 
Washington, D.C. or San Francisco) on the relevant route is only 37 percent and that this figure is a more accurate 
representation of United's market share. Defs.' Ex. 8, ¶28. These disputes are why, among other reasons, the plaintiff's motion 
for partial summary judgment must be denied. "
1223,4," United also contends that Dominguez lacks standing. Though the Court recognizes that Dominguez's claims of injury are 
indeed speculative, it is difficult to distinguish whether that is because he lacks standing  [*9] or whether he has failed to 
demonstrate a violation of the antitrust laws. However, because the Court has concluded as a matter of law that no antitrust 
violation has occurred, there is no need to address standing. "
1224,5," Dominguez cites two cases for the proposition that the ticket forming the contract between him and United is sufficient to 
constitute an agreement under Section 1. PL's Opp'n 36 (citing Systemcare, Inc. v. Wang Labs. Corp., 117 F.3d 1137 (10th Cir. 
1997); United States v. Am. Linen Supply Co., 141 F. Supp. 105, 114-15 (N.D. 111. 1956)). Yet, both are distinguishable on their 
facts. American Linen Supply involved vertical contracts between a manufacturer and its distributors that prohibited the 
distributors from competing for customers. 141 F. Supp. at 115 (describing contracts between seller and distributors as 
""horizontal agreement to allocate customers"" that was ""effectuated through the instrumentality of. . . the common seller.""). 
Systemcare dealt with a tying arrangement that forced customers purchasing software support services to also purchase "
1225,," hardware support services. 117 F.3d at 1139. As discussed above, both of those agreements involve an element of coercion 
beyond a mere unilateral refusal  [*14] to deal absent acceptance to an announced policy. "
1226,6," The Northwest Airlines plaintiffs also brought a Section 1 claim; however, as Dominguez only relies on the case to support his 
Section 2 claim, the discussion of the case will be limited to its Section 2 analysis. "
1227,7," Moreover, the case is also distinguishable on its facts: in Northwest, the travel agents that were allegedly excluded from the 
market ""sold 80% or more of Northwest's tickets."" Chase v. Northwest Airlines Corp., 49 F. Supp. 2d 553, 555 (E.D. Mich. 1999) 
(an earlier decision in the same case). The plaintiffs claimed that if the airlines' restriction against hidden-city ticketing were lifted, 
the travel agents would compete to publicize and sell hidden-city tickets at lower prices along the relevant city-pair routes. In re 
Northwest Airlines, 208 F.R.D. at 209. By contrast, Dominguez does not claim that any of United's tickets, let alone a significant 
portion of tickets, are sold by the allegedly excluded parties. United  [*22] and Dominguez dispute whether a monopolist has a 
duty to deal with its rivals. In the wake of Aspen Skiing and Trinko, however, our Circuit has made clear that a viable antitrust 
claim based on a monopolist's refusal to deal can only exist where the plaintiff can show ""either that the defendant had 
previously 'engaged in a course of dealing with its rivals or [that it] would ever have done so absent statutory compulsion."" 
Covad Commc'ns Co. v. Bell Atl. Corp., 398 F.3d 666, 673, 365 U.S. App. D.C. 78 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (quoting Trinko, 540 U.S. at 
409) (alteration in original). Here, unlike in Northwest, Dominguez has not claimed nor put forth evidence of United ever 
cooperating with secondary resellers to effect passenger name changes. Thus, even assuming that secondary resellers are 
competitors of United, its refusal to deal is not anticompetitive. "
1233,1," H.R.S. § 480-2 states as follows: Unfair Competition, practices, declared unlawful. (a) Unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are 
unlawful. (b) In construing this section, the courts and the office of consumer protection shall give due consideration to the rules, 
regulations and decisions of the Federal Trade Commission and the federal courts interpreting section 5(a)(1) of the 
Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 45(a)(1)), as from time to time amended. (c) No showing that the proceeding or suit would be in the public interest (as these terms are interpreted under section 5(b) 
of the Federal Trade Commission Act) is necessary  [*13] in any action brought under this section. (d) No person other than a consumer, the attorney general or the director of the office of consumer protection may bring an 
action based upon unfair or deceptive acts or practices declared unlawful by this section. (e) Any person may bring an action based on unfair methods of competition declared unlawful by this section. "
1234,2," H.R.S. § 480-13 dealing with ""Suits by injured persons, amount of recovery,"" states: (a) Except as provided in subsections (b) 
and (c), any person who is injured in the person's business or property by reason of anything declared unlawful by this chapter: (1) May sue for damages sustained by the person, and, if the judgment is for the plaintiff, the plaintiff shall be awarded a 
sum not less than $1,000 or threefold damages by the plaintiff sustained, whichever sum is the greater, and reasonable 
attorney's fees...[and] (2) May bring proceedings to enjoin the  [*14] unlawful practices, and if the decree is for the plaintiff, the plaintiff shall be 
awarded reasonable attorney's fees together with the costs of suit. "
1235,3," H.R.S. § 480-2 was enacted in 2002 in response to a decision by the Hawaii Supreme in which the Court held that there was 
no private claim under H.R.S. § 480-13 for unfair methods of competition that violated H.R.S. § 480-2. See Robert's Hawaii Sch. 
Bus, Inc. v. Laupahoehoe Transp. Co., Inc., 91 Haw. 224, 982 P.2d 853, 878 (1999)."
1235,4," The provision was originally intended to ""strengthen Hawaii's wage and hour law"" and would have amended Hawaii's Wage 
and Hour statute, H.R.S. § 388-6, instead of Hawaii's Antitrust statute. Id. at 313. Due to concerns expressed by the Department 
of Labor and Industrial Relations that the definition of ""tips"" included in the original version would conflict with federal wage law, 
the legislature ""amended the bill by deleting its contents and inserting a new section regarding unfair and deceptive business 
practices."" Id. According to the legislative history, the purpose of the new bill was ""to prevent unfair and deceptive business 
practices,"" and ""enhance consumer protection."" Id. The legislative history also expressed concern that employees were not 
receiving ""money intended as a gratuity by the customer."" Id. at 314. "
1236,5," In HMA, the plaintiff, Hawaii Medical Association (HMA), brought suit on its own behalf and on behalf  [*22] of participating 
physicians in Hawaii Medical Service Association's (HMSA) network for violations of H.R.S. § 480-2 and tortious interference 
with a prospective economic advantage. Id. at 1183. HMA alleged that HMSA engaged in a scheme to avoid making timely and 
complete payments owed to physician members, after HMA physicians provided medical care to HMSA members pursuant to 
agreements entered into by the physicians and HMA. Id. at 1186. HMSA filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings arguing, in 
part, that HMA's unfair competition claim failed because HMA had not pled any direct injury to its ""business or property."" Id. at 
1188. The lower court agreed and HMA appealed. "
1239,6," Section 1 of the Sherman Act states that ""[e]very contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in 
restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal."" 15 U.S.C. § 1. "
1240,7," In Glen Holly Entm't, Inc. v. Tektronix, Inc., 343 F.3d 1000, 1008, the plaintiff filed suit under Section 4 of the Clayton Act for 
violations of the Sherman Act against two manufacturers of film editing equipment. The plaintiff alleged that the defendants 
entered into an agreement to jointly market certain products and to prohibit one of the manufacturers from selling the products to 
certain customers, including the plaintiff. Id. at 1005-1006. The plaintiff alleged that this caused the plaintiff to lose its customers 
and violated sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act because it was a ""contract or conspiracy"" that created a monopoly and 
destroyed competition, thereby constituting a per se violation of the Sherman Act. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that 
the plaintiff's allegations of injury were sufficient because they ""stem[med] from a competition-reducing aspect or effect of [the 
defendants'] behavior."" Id. at 1014. "
1244,1," The Scott Fetzer Company has several divisions of business. The Kirby Company (""Kirby"") is an unincorporated subsidiary of 
Scott Fetzer, and most of Plaintiff's facts and evidence relevant to this action involve only the Kirby division. The Court will refer 
to ""Kirby"" and ""Defendant"" interchangeably in this Order. "
1245,2," Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a) and (b)(3) state: (a) Prerequisites. One or more members of a class may sue or be sued as representative parties on behalf of all members only 
if: (1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable; (2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class; (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class; and (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. (b) Types of Class Actions. A class action may be maintained if Rule 23(a) is satisfied and if: (3) the court finds that the questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only 
individual members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the 
controversy. The matters pertinent to these findings include: (A) the class members' interests in individually controlling  [*5] the prosecution or defense of separate actions; (B) the extent and nature of any litigation concerning the controversy already begun by or against class members; (C) the desirability or undesirability of concentrating the litigation of the claims in the particular forum; and (D) the likely difficulties in managing a class action. "
1246,3," The reasons for consumer rescissions included the following. First, 3 under Kirby's three-day cancellation policy, any purchaser 
was entitled to cancel the purchase within the first three business days after the purchase for any reason. Nichols Dep. 149:22-
150:20, ECF No. 49-9. Second, under Kirby's ""Golden Ager"" policy, senior citizens were allowed to cancel their purchases at any 
time within one year from the date of the purchase. Id. at 149:6-21; see Nichols Dep. Ex. 9, Kirby Distrib. Policies & 
Recommended Practices, Golden Ager Policy 8, ECF  [*9] No. 49-22. Third, under the ""Patch It Up or Pick It Up"" policy, if a 
distributor could not satisfy a consumer, the distributor would cancel the purchase and return the consumer's purchase price. 
Nichols Dep. 150:21-151:17; Kirby Distrib. Policies & Recommended Practices, Patch It Up or Pick It Up Policy 13, ECF No. 49-
23. Lastly, a purchase could be rescinded if the financing that the distributors or dealers arranged to finance a consumer's 
purchase fell through so that the consumer could not qualify for the purchase. Nichols Dep. 152:10-22. "
1247,4," In March 2006, Kirby implemented a new Purple Card policy for its distributors to use when they sold previously returned 
cleaning systems. Nichols Dep. 173:18-174:3. The Purple Cards were only to be used by distributors ""when the Kirby home care 
system[s] which [were] the subject of the sale ha[d] previously been returned by another customer,"" which could have occurred 
""when the original purchaser cancel[led] the sale within the purchaser's right to cancel period, or financing [was] not approved."" 
Nichols Dep. Ex. 18, Mem. to All Domestic Factory Distribs., Mar. 29, 2006, ECF No. 49-29. The individual distributors were 
instructed to ""inform the subsequent purchaser(s) that the merchandise  [*11] had been previously purchased by another 
consumer."" Id. These Purple Card purchasers are not included in the proposed class in this action."
1247,5," Jordan v. Scott Fetzer Co., No. 4:07-CV-80 (CDL), 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89157, 2007 WL 4287719 5 (M.D. Ga. Dec. 4, 2007)."

1248,7," Respondents were surveyed in seven slightly different interview conditions (or cells). Respondents in six of the cells were told 
that the typical price of a new Kirby vacuum was either $1,000, $1,300, $1,500, $1,650, $1,800, or $1,900. Isaacson Expert 
Report 1 ¶ 5; Isaacson Questionnaire 2. Respondents in one cell received no mention of price. Isaacson Expert Report 1 ¶ 5; 
Isaacson Questionnaire 2. "
1249,8," Dr. Isaacson's survey yielded the following results: Hypothetical New Price: Average Expected Discount: $1,000 $388 $1,300 $501 $1,500 $551 $1,650 $572 $1,800 $647 $1,900 $667 Harrison Expert Report 10. "
1251,9," The elements of mail and wire fraud are identical. Carpenter v. United States, 484 U.S. 19, 25 n.6, 108 S. Ct. 316, 98 L. Ed. 2d 
275 (1987). The mail fraud statute reads: Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by 
means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, or to sell, dispose of, loan, exchange, alter, give 
away, distribute, supply, or furnish or procure for unlawful use any counterfeit or spurious coin, obligation, security, or other 
article, or anything represented to be or intimated or held out to be such counterfeit or spurious  [*24] article, for the 
purpose of executing such scheme or artifice or attempting so to do, places in any post office or authorized depository for 
mail matter, any matter or thing whatever to be sent or delivered by the Postal Service, or deposits or causes to be 
deposited any matter or thing whatever to be sent or delivered by any private or commercial interstate carrier, or takes or 
receives therefrom, any such matter or thing, or knowingly causes to be delivered by mail or such carrier according to the 
direction thereon, or at the place at which it is directed to be delivered by the person to whom it is addressed, any such 
matter or thing, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both."
1251,18," U.S.C. § 1341. The wire fraud statute reads: Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by 
means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, transmits or causes to be transmitted by means of 
wire, radio, or television communication in interstate or foreign commerce, any writings, signs, signals, pictures, or sounds 
for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice, shall be fined  [*25] under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 
years, or both."
1251,18, U.S.C. § 1343. 
1252,10," This measure of damages is consistent with the approach taken by Georgia courts in state law fraud claims. See Kunzler 
Enters., Inc. v. Rowe, 211 Ga. App. 4, 5, 438 S.E.2d 365, 365 (1993) (stating that in an action based on a fraudulent 
misrepresentation ""the measure of damages is the actual loss sustained by the plaintiff, and if the contract is one of purchase 
and sale the 'actual damages' are the difference between the value of the thing sold at the time of delivery and what would have 
been its value if the representations made by the defendants had been true.""); accord McCrary v. Pritchard, 119 Ga. 876, 47 
S.E. 341, 344 (1904). "
1254,11," The Court notes that Mr. Roberts testified that his Kirby cleaning system is ""a good vacuum cleaner"" and that ""the only 
 [*35] problem I have was that they told me a lie."" Roberts Dep. 39:1-2, ECF No. 76; see id. at 39:17-41:5 (stating Mr. Roberts is 
happy with the way his Kirby cleaning system works, that he has no complaints about it, and that he still uses the cleaning 
system)."
1254,12," The McLaughlin court also characterized the plaintiff's theory and survey as ""pure speculation."" McLaughlin, 522 F.3d at 229. 
While consumers are no doubt more capable of conceptualizing a previously-owned Kirby cleaning system than ""the 
impossible—a healthy cigarette,"" the Court notes that Plaintiff's theory and survey also engage in a healthy dose of speculation 
when they ask respondents what price they would expect to pay for a previously-owned Kirby cleaning system in the complete 
absence of any information about the cleaning system's condition or prior use and after only being told a hypothetical price for a 
new Kirby cleaning system. Damages flowing from such speculation are not proper under RICO. See Anderson, 51 F.3d at 523 
(""[The plaintiff's] claimed damages would have required extensive speculation and would not simply entail a calculation of 
present, actual damages. Such speculative damages are not compensable under RICO[.]"")."
1254,13," Professor Harrison offered two benchmark overcharge methods: (1) the least  [*39] possible overcharge approach; and (2) the 
graduated overcharge approach. Both methods involve the factfinder determining ""a benchmark or 'but for' outcome and then . . 
. compar[ing] that benchmark with the transaction that was affected by the misrepresentation."" Harrison Expert Report 7. "
1255,14," Plaintiff's citation to the Court's Order granting Plaintiffs' amended motion to compel for the proposition that ""Mr. Roberts has 
previously demonstrated that the standard for damages and injury under RICO and the Clayton Act are the same"" is inaccurate. 
Pl.'s Reply to Def.'s Resp. in Opp'n to Mot. for Class Certification 25, ECF No. 107. Based on Plaintiffs' representations at that 
time, the Court repeated its earlier finding that Plaintiffs had alleged a cognizable theory of damages under RICO based on the

1260,4," Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3) provides: (b) Types of Class Actions. A class action may be maintained if Rule 23(a) is satisfied and if: (3) the court finds that the questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting 
only individual members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating 
the controversy. The matters pertinent to these findings include: (A) the class members' interests in individually controlling the prosecution or defense of separate actions; "
1261,, (B) the extent and nature of any litigation concerning the controversy already begun by or against class members; (C) the desirability or undesirability of concentrating the litigation of the claims  [*13] in the particular forum; and (D) the likely difficulties in managing a class action. Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 23(b)(3).
1261,5," The antitrust and consumer protection statutes under which plaintiffs state their claims all have injury as an element. Further, 
unjust enrichment claims are based on the theory that ""[a] person who has been unjustly enriched at the expense of another is 
required to make restitution to the other."" Restatement of Restitution § 1; see also In re K-Dur Antitrust Litig., No. 01-1652,  
2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 71771, *39 n.13 (D.N.J. March 27, 2008) (""[I]n general, a plaintiff alleging unjust enrichment must show: 
(1) at plaintiff's expense; (2) defendant received a benefit; (3) under circumstances that would make it unjust for defendant to 
retain the benefit without paying for it.""). ""Injury"" is not an element of unjust enrichment, but the doctrine requires the plaintiffs to 
prove that it would be unfair for the defendant to retain the fruits of his alleged anticompetitive conduct. See K-Dur, 2008 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 71771, at *39-40 n.13. Put another way, it would be necessary for the plaintiffs to show that the defendant unlawfully 
benefitted from plaintiffs' purchases of Wellbutrin  [*14] SR. As pleaded, this unjust benefit would necessitate proof each plaintiff 
was compelled to purchase Wellbutrin SR because he was precluded from purchasing the generic substitute or that he paid 
higher prices for the branded drug. See id. I will not address whether the differences in the state laws under which plaintiffs bring 
their claims present an insurmountable problem for class certification, because I will deny plaintiffs' motion on the ground that 
they cannot show class-wide impact. "
1262,6," Because the End-Payor Plaintiffs seek certification under Rule 23(b)(3), the Court will confine its analysis to that standard and 
will not consider whether the proposed class meets the requirements of Rule 23(b)(1) or (b)(2). "

1266,10," Dr. Rosenthal describes two types of so-called horizontal differentiation. The first, ""actual differentiation,"" distinguishes 
""products within a therapeutic class along non-price dimensions such as the number and types of approved indications and side 
effect profiles."" The other type, differentiation by illusion, distinguishes products solely through ""marketing to physicians and 
consumers."" Rosenthal Decl. ¶ 11."
1266,11," Rosenthal elaborates on the role of health insurers: During the period relevant to this matter, 2001 to [2006], private third party pay[o]rs covered approximately 44% of all retail 
prescription drug purchases. Because of double-digit prescription drug spending growth that began in the 1990s, third party 
pay[o]rs began adopting aggressive cost control mechanisms by the end of that decade. These mechanisms include tiered 
formularies, generic substitution programs, and  [*34] coinsurance (copayments that are a percent of the retail price of a "
1267,," drug rather than a fixed dollar amount). Tiered formularies, which were the most common structure of prescription drug 
benefit in 2003 (57% of enrollees in employer-sponsored plans are now covered by this type of benefit design), provide 
consumers with incentives to choose lower-cost drugs by requiring higher copayments for certain groups of drugs. In the 
most common type of three-tiered formulary benefit, generic drugs require the lowest copayment (e.g., $10), brand name 
drugs whose manufacturers offer the third party pay[o]r generous discounts and rebates require a somewhat higher 
copayment (e.g., $25) and the remaining brand name drugs are associated with the highest copayment (e.g., $50) or 
coinsurance (e.g., 50%). Recent studies have documented the effectiveness of tiered formularies as strategies for 
influencing drug choice and spending. Rosenthal Decl. ¶ 13 (internal citations omitted)."
1267,12," The Drug Price and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, is codified at 21 
U.S.C. § 355(j). Under the Act, a would-be generic manufacturer is permitted to file an Abbreviated New Drug Application. 
 [*35] The ANDA incorporates FDA findings on the safety and effectiveness of a previously approved list drug given a showing 
that the new generic drug is bioequivalent to the listed drug. 21 U.S.C. § 355(j). "
1268,13," Dr. Rosenthal defines the ""expected stream of profits"" as the ""product of the number of units that the generic entrant can sell 
(i.e., the generic penetration rate divided by the number of entrants, multiplied by the total units for the molecule) and the profit 
margin."" Rosenthal Decl. ¶ 20. "
1269,14," Jagt explains: DTC advertising requires a period of time to have an effect on prescriptions since it takes time to both build awareness 
through DTC and for patients who see the DTC ads to discuss the product with their healthcare provider and obtain a 
prescription from their [healthcare provider] if deemed appropriate. Therefore, we would very carefully evaluate the decision 
to begin or continue an investment in expensive DTC media advertising for a product that was nearing the end of its patent 
life. Jagt Decl. ¶ 6 (emphasis added)."
1269,15," Wellbutrin SR's predecessor, Wellbutrin IR, required administration three-times-daily and carried with it the risk of seizure as a 
potential side effect. Wellbutrin SR, however, required only a twice-daily dosing regimen and had an improved side effect profile. 
See Jagt. Decl. ¶¶ 15, 17."
1269,16," Clinical studies showed that Wellbutrin SR was of comparable efficacy to other antidepressants, particularly Zoloft, yet 
presented a lower incidence of sexual dysfunction and no measured impact on weight. Id. at ¶ 17. "
1271,17," Dr. Bigelow provides a brief description of each of the following studies cited by Dr. Rosenthal: Both Caves et al. and Grabowski and Vernon analyze the determinants of the ratio of the average (within a market at a 
point in time) generic  [*49] price to the average brand price. Similarly, the CBO studies the relationship between the 
average price paid by retail pharmacies for generic drugs and the average price they pay for brand name drugs. Frank and 
Salkever's econometric analysis studies the determinants of average prices for generic and brand name drugs. Bigelow Decl. ¶ 23 n.20 (internal citations omitted)."
1271,18," Dr. Bigelow included data on the branded drug Zyban in both Exhibits 3 and 4. As Zyban is not pertinent to my analysis, I will 
exclude it from my discussion. Similarly, Exhibit 4 contains data on the 200mg dosage of Wellbutrin SR, which is also irrelevant 
to the class certification discussion and will be excluded."
1271,19," Dr. Bigelow explains: Weighted average net prices for a trade group are estimated by reducing the weighted average [wholesaler acquisition 
cost] in each quarter by that trade group's average discount percentage for that quarter. Weighted average quarterly WAC 
is calculated by dividing quarterly gross sales dollars by quarterly gross sales units. Discount percentages for each trade 
group are calculated by dividing each trade group's total discount amount by its contracted  [*51] sales total (calculated at 
WAC). Bigelow Decl. ¶ 28 n.30."
1271,20," Dr. Bigelow notes that the data exhibit an exception to the showing of uniformly higher weighted average net prices: For Managed Care entities there was some fluctuation during 2004, but weighted average net prices to this group for 
Wellbutrin SR 150 mg ended 2004 at a higher level than they had been during any quarter of 2003. Exhibit 3.b also shows 
that occasional fluctuation has pre generic-entry precedents in [the third and fourth quarters of 2003], so it is unlikely to 
have been caused by generic entry. Bigelow Decl. ¶ 28. "
1273,21," Dr. Rosenthal testified as follows at her deposition: Q. So it is not a predicate to use a yardstick or a common methodology to calculate damages that everyone in the class has 
been injured? A. The class is defined as narrowly here for those members who consume Wellbutrin SR. Of course there's certain class 
members who won't be included in the yardstick analysis and won't be included in the ultimate  [*57] damage analysis. Those 
might include, for example, government payors. So they would not be included here. But the class members that we talked 
about before, all consumers and third-party payor who purchased as end payors Wellbutrin SR or Zyban, they're included in this 
analysis. There's no part of the analysis that tries to exclude individuals that may or — may not have sustained zero injury 
because of their co-payment arrangement, for example. . . . A. As we talked about before, there may be some consumers or third-party payors, because of payment arrangements, did not 
actually sustain impact. My analysis won't be able to identify them. So they may be in the analysis. Q. So essentially those people who haven't been injured would be getting certain damages based on your theory? A. I believe that's a question of allocation. Again, the estimate of aggregate impact will be accurate, and that's the question I've 
addressed here, is how do we accurately assess aggregate impact to the class. Q. Including those people who we've already agreed have suffered no injury? A. We've sort of agreed that there are hypothetical people who may have suffered no injury. They aren't identified, can't be 
identified  [*58] here to be excluded. They're included in the class definition. Rosenthal Deposition 180:17-181:5, 182:4-24 (emphasis added). "
1274,22," Dr. Bigelow testified at his deposition as follows: A. What Exhibit 4 represents, as I said, is the total dollars that the retail pharmacy receives for the prescription from the various 
sources from which it receives it. That may include — that will include pharmacy benefits management companies, or other 
entities that get rebates from the manufacturer. To the extent that the rebates, those parties receive in turn reflect their 
negotiations with the pharmacy, they'll be a reflection of that in the numbers you see here on Exhibit 4. But Exhibit 4 doesn't 
purport to represent pricing at some other level of this business. Exhibit 4 represents pricing at the retail level. Q. Are you aware of the phenomenon that when, or at least the argument, put it that way, are you aware of the argument that 
when a retail branded drug goes  [*62] generic that the branded company will increase the amount of rebates that are paid to 
PBMs and/or managed care entities which are not reflected at the retail pharmacy level? A. I don't believe I recall hearing that suggestion before. "
1275,23," For the purposes of this memorandum, ""supra-competitive prices"" means ""prices higher than the prices which would obtain in 
a competitive regime."" McDonough, 638 F. Supp. 2d at 483 n.13 (internal quotations omitted)."
1275,24," No decision has been cited, nor can I find one, in this or any Circuit, in which the court explicitly held that indirect purchaser 
plaintiffs are not required to show impact to direct purchasers through common, formulaic proof."
1275,25," ""Indirect-purchaser plaintiffs, like direct-purchaser plaintiffs, must demonstrate that they paid a higher price . . . than they 
would otherwise have paid absent a conspiracy. However, 'the problem of proof in an indirect purchaser case is intrinsically 
more complex, because the damage model must account  [*66] for the actions of innocent intermediaries who allegedly passed 
on the overcharge.'"" In re Graphics Processing, 253 F.R.D. at 499 (quoting William H. Page, The Limits of State Indirect 
Purchaser Suits: Class Certification in the Shadow of Illinois Brick, 67 Antitrust L.J. 4, 12 (1999-2000)). "
1277,26," Plaintiffs relied on the expert report of Dr. Gary French in arguing that common evidence  [*73] is available to show that all 
class members were adversely impacted on their purchases of Wellbutrin SR and generic buproprion. "
1278,27," ""Recovering in an Indirect-Purchaser case under state law requires a demonstration that a defendant overcharged its Direct-
Purchasers for the product at issue, and that those Direct-Purchasers then passed on the overcharges  [*77] to indirect 
purchasers."" In re Flash Memory, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 59491, *53-54."
1278,28," No part of Rosenthal's report acknowledges direct purchasers are necessary intermediaries in the chain of liability from GSK 
to the end-payor plaintiffs. I have already addressed and found fault with Dr. Rosenthal's silence on the issue of impact to direct 
purchasers. But, for the purposes of the indirect purchasers section, I will disregard this broken link in the causal chain and 
independently evaluate Rosenthal's theories of causation and liability."
1278,29," When a price is said to ""decrease,"" this means prices were lower or continued to increase, but at a slower rate."
1278,30," See Rosenthal Decl. ¶ 17 n.18 (citing Cong. Budget Office; Frank and Salkever; Grabowski and Vernon;  [*79] and Caves, 
Whinston, and Hurwitz). Rosenthal also submits that her own research confirms her conclusions here and explains that she has 
""either submitted testimony and/or consulted on the launches of approximately 10 generics over the last 7 years."" Id. ¶¶ 18, 18 "
1279,," n.19. I do not doubt Dr. Rosenthal's qualification as an expert, but as she has not provided specific references to any of her own 
prior research, I cannot consider it as corroborative."
1279,31," The CBO reported the following equivocal results: Several economists have studied what happens to the prices of innovator drugs when generic copies enter the market. All 
of the studies agree that the effect on innovators' prices is very small, although there is some dispute about the direction of 
that effect. . . . Overall, brand-name prices frequently continue to rise after generic entry. Whether they rise more quickly or more slowly 
than would be the case without competition from generic drugs, however, is unclear based on these studies. Cong. Budget Office at 30."
1279,32," Dr. Rosenthal also appears to base her conclusion that all class members sustained economic injury on her ability to show 
that common proof will demonstrate prices for bupropion SR were higher than they would have been absent the generic entry 
delay for both generic switchers and brand loyalists. Rosenthal Decl. ¶ 9(b)."
1279,33," Even if Dr. Rosenthal's arguments regarding Dr. Bigelow's models cast doubt on his price data, this does not obscure the fact 
that her own damages declaration confirms that brand prices were higher post generic entry. For that reason, I will decline to 
address Rosenthal's early criticisms of Dr. Bigelow's models, because she has now confirmed his ultimate assertion, that brand 
prices increased, with her own data. I would like to note though, that Rosenthal's own models suffer from the same defects for 
which she faulted Dr. Bigelow. In her graphs tracing the generic price change, generic penetration rate, and brand price change 
of her but-for statistics as compared to her comparison yardsticks, Rosenthal admittedly uses Verispan data. Rosenthal 
Damages Decl. Exs. C.1-C.3. In criticizing Bigelow's exhibit showing the Verispan prices of Wellbutrin SR over many years, 
Rosenthal claimed Verispan data reflect retail pharmacy prices and fails to account for ""rebates that are paid by drug companies 
to pharmacy benefit managers  [*83] and managed care organizations."" Rosenthal Reply Decl. ¶ 7. Accordingly, she concludes 
that the model using this Verispan data does not establish ""prices to end-pay[o]rs increased, decreased, or remained the same 
after the entry of sustained release generic bupropion hydrochloride."" Rosenthal's criticisms are a double-edged sword, and her 
own damages calculations use the very data she criticized Bigelow for using. "
1280,34," Exhibit D.4 — ""Wellbutrin SR 100 mg Overcharge Damages Assuming But-For Generic Launch on March 1, 2002"" — 
represents that but-for brand prices were lower than actual brand prices only in the third and fourth quarters of 2002. See 
Rosenthal Damages Decl. Ex. D.4. Similarly, Exhibit D.5 — ""Wellbutrin SR 150 mg Overcharge Damages Assuming But-For 
Generic Launch on March 1, 2002"" — shows but-for brand prices were lower than actual brand prices in 2002, the first two 
quarters of 2003, and the first quarter of 2004."
1280,35, [ILLEGIBLE FOOTNOTE] 
1281,36," 36 It is immaterial that out-of-pocket losses are not the equivalent 36 of antitrust injury, because the third-party payors will bear 
the loss in some situations and the consumers in other situations. K-Dur, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 71771, at *49 (""Since antitrust 
injury is not the same as out-of-pocket-loss, on some transactions, the third-party payor will bear the out-of-pocket loss (for 
example where there are fixed or no co-pays), and on others the consumer will bear the loss (where the difference in the co-pay 
exceeds the difference between the supra-competitive and but-for price."")). "
1282,37," The Third Circuit recently acknowledged that where certification of a settlement class is at question, predominance is decided 
in light of imminent settlement: Unlike in In re Hydrogen Peroxide Antitrust Litigation, where the certification inquiry was set against the backdrop of an 
impending trial, here we are not as concerned with formulating some prediction as to how this element of [an antitrust act] 
violation will play out at trial for the proposal is that there be no trial, and instead our inquiry is solely for the purpose of 
ensuring that issues common to the class predominate over individual ones. In re Insurance Brokerage Antitrust Litig., 579 F.3d 241, 269 (3d Cir. 2009)."
1282,38," The District of New Jersey has distinguished Warfarin  [*92] Sodium on the same grounds. See K-Dur, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
71771, at *51-52. [I]t is apparent that the Warfarin court's decision to include the [third party payors] and the fixed co-pay consumers in the 
settlement class had far more to do with the convenience of, or the potential benefits derived from including them in the 
settlement class, or the inconvenience of extracting them from it, not recognition of or concerns about any shared injury. Id. (emphasis added)."
1282,39," This argument really pertains to standing to bring an antitrust claim, but it also underscores that these brand loyalists were not 
injured. Class members who have no antitrust injury whatsoever would have no viable antitrust claims."" See Sullivan, 613 F.3d 
134, 2010 U.S. App. LEXIS 14375, at *52-53 (citing Angelico v. Lehigh Valley Hosp., Inc., 184 F.3d 268, 273-274 (3d Cir. 1999) 
(requiring plaintiffs to show they have suffered an antitrust injury as a prerequisite to obtaining standing to bring an antitrust 
claim)). "
1296,1," Elsewhere in the complaint, DocMagic alleges only that Ellie Mae is able to obtain a market share of over 50%, but not that it 
has already done so. Compl. ¶¶ 127-28. Construing the complaint liberally, the court assumes that DocMagic is alleging that 
Ellie Mae currently possesses a 60% market share in the DPS market. "
1297,2," Monopoly leveraging constitutes the use of monopoly power in one market to acquire, or attempt to acquire, monopoly power in 
a related product market. Image Technical Servs., Inc. v. Eastman Kodak Co., 125 F.3d 1195, 1208 (9th Cir. 1997)."
1297,3," In general, a company has the right to deal  [**17] or not to deal with another party at its own discretion. Verizon Commc'ns Inc. 
v. Law Offices of Curtis V. Trinko, 540 U.S. 398, 408, 124 S. Ct. 872, 157 L. Ed. 2d 823 (2004). However, that right is not 
absolute; a company may not refuse to deal in circumstances where ""a refusal to cooperate with rivals [would] constitute 
anticompetitive conduct and violate [15 U.S.C.] § 2."" Id. The Ninth Circuit has pointed out three factors which can indicate to a 
court that a particular refusal to deal was anticompetitive: the unilateral termination of a voluntary and profitable course of 
dealing, a refusal to sell to a competitor at the same price offered to non-competitors, and the refusal to sell products to a 
competitor that are being offered at retail to other customers. MetroNet Servs. Corp. v. Qwest Corp., 383 F.3d 1124, 1132-34 
(9th Cir. 2004). A refusal to deal need not be absolute in order to be actionable. ""An offer to deal with a competitor only on 
unreasonable terms and conditions can amount to a practical refusal to deal."" Id. at 1132."
1297,4," ""A company which has monopoly power over an essential facility may not refuse to make the facility available to others when 
there is no legitimate business reason for the refusal. The  [**18] wrong perpetrated by that misuse of the facility is that a 
monopolist 'can extend monopoly power from one state of production to another, and from one market to another.' "" City of 
Anaheim v. S. Cal. Edison Co., 955 F.2d 1373, 1379 (9th Cir. 1992) (quoting MCI Commc'ns Corp. v. Am. Tel. & Tel. Co., 708 
F.2d 1081, 1132 (7th Cir. 1983)); accord MetroNet, 383 F.3d at 1128-29. For a facility to be essential, it must be otherwise unavailable, and impossible to reasonably or practically replicate. MetroNet, 
383 F.3d at 1129-30. Furthermore, ""[a] facility that is controlled by a single firm will be considered 'essential' only if control of the 
facility carries with it the power to eliminate competition in the downstream market."" Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. United Airlines, Inc., 
948 F.2d 536, 544 (9th Cir. 1991) (emphasis original). "
1299,5," The three factors necessary for showing indirectly that a defendant possesses market power demonstrate that the market will 
not function efficiently if the defendant raises its prices. In an efficient market, when a large producer sets artificially high prices, 
consumers will switch from that producer to other producers who sell at efficient prices. The demand of these switching 
consumers is met either by increased production from other producers already  [**26] in the market or by new competing 
producers entering the market. In either case, the price in the market does not rise or does so only briefly—the large producer 
charging a price above the market price simply loses business. However, if either of the mechanisms for meeting the increased 
demand is unavailable, then consumers will be unable to switch away from the large producer, and so will be forced to pay the 
large producer's artificially high prices. In this situation, the large producer has monopoly power, because it can control the 
market price of its goods. See generally Areeda ¶ 501. "
1301,6," The court expresses no opinion as to whether the submarket consisting of document preparation services provided to 
Encompass users or ePASS users could constitute a properly defined submarket, within which Ellie Mae has non-contractually-
acquired market power, for the purposes of an antitrust claim. See Newcal, 513 F.3d at 1045-51. "
1302,7," Because DocMagic is alleging trade dress in its product design, rather than product packaging, it is not permitted, as a matter 
of law, to allege that its trade dress is inherently distinctive; to satisfy the first element of a trade dress claim it must allege 
secondary meaning. See Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Samara Bros., Inc., 529 U.S. 205, 212-214, 216, 120 S. Ct. 1339, 146 L. Ed. 
2d 182 (2000). "
1303,8," It should also be noted that in a post-hearing submission, DocMagic admitted it does not hold a registered trademark in either 
of the words, nor has it applied for one. "
1308,9," To the extent that Ellie Mae relies on the allegations in Counterclaim ¶ 20 to support its claim of direct copyright infringement, 
DocMagic properly notes that Ellie Mae has failed to identify which ""confidential materials"" are it issue, and whether Ellie Mae 
holds a copyright in the unidentified ""confidential materials."" In paragraphs 26 and 27, the only copyrights that Ellie Mae asserts 
 [**62] that DocMagic infringed are the copyrights for Encompass and the Encompass SDK. To the extent the counterclaim 
could be read to allege that DocMagic infringed any other copyrights, those allegations are stricken. "
1310,10," The cases upon which DocMagic relies to argue the opposite position, cases which arise under the CFAA, not the CCDAFA, 
are readily distinguishable. In AtPac, Inc. v. Aptitude Solutions, Inc., No. CIV. 2:10-294 WBS KJM, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 42109, 
2010 WL 1779901 (E.D. Cal. Apr. 29, 2010), and SecureInfo Corp. v. Telos Corp., 387 F. Supp. 2d 593 (E.D. Va. 2005), the 
plaintiffs brought suit against the defendants when the defendants accessed computers belonging to third parties, with the third 
parties' authorization, and viewed plaintiffs' proprietary information stored on the third parties' computers. See AtPac, 2010 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 42109, 2010 WL 1779901, at *6; SecureInfo, 387 F. Supp. 2d at 608-09. Ellie Mae, however, alleges that DocMagic 
accessed Ellie Mae's own computers, not merely that DocMagic obtained Ellie Mae's proprietary information by accessing a 
third-party's computers. See Counterclaim ¶ 20. This allegation states  [**71] a claim under the CCDAFA. See AtPac, 2010 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 42109, 2010 WL 1779901, at *6 (holding that CFAA claim may lie where the defendant ""uses subterfuge—like using 
user names and passwords that do not belong to it—to gain access to plaintiff's protected materials on plaintiff's own website, 
computer, or servers"") (emphasis added); State Analysis, Inc. v. Am. Fin. Servs. Ass'n, 621 F. Supp. 2d 309, 316 (E.D. Va. 
2009). Ellie Mae need not also allege that DocMagic lacked the permission of those third parties to use the third parties' license 
keys or passwords. "
1311,11," The  [**74] court notes that paragraph 68 of Ellie Mae's counterclaim indicates that the Encompass SDK was included in the 
Ellie Mae Proprietary Information provided to DocMagic under the Bridge Agreement, whereas paragraph 14 of the counterclaim 
indicates that DocMagic was not given an Encompass SDK license key. The court assumes, as it must, that both of these 
allegations are true. "
1319,1," This section provides a summary of the well-pleaded allegations of the Second Consolidated Amended Complaint (""DSCAC"") 
(Direct [ECF No. 203]) in the Direct Purchaser Action. The Corrected Third Consolidated Amended Complaint (""ICTCAC"") 
(Indirect [ECF No. 109])  [**18] in the Indirect Purchaser Action contains essentially the same substantive allegations as the 
DSCAC with respect to the existence of a conspiracy, and the parties have stipulated that the plausibility of the conspiracy 
should be tested under the allegations of the DSCAC. The facts in the background section are presented in the light most 
favorable to Plaintiffs."
1319,2," Portland cement is the most common type of cement and is the primary ingredient in a number of construction materials, 
including concrete."
1319,3," Concrete, or more specifically ready-mix concrete, is a mixture of cement, aggregate (sand, gravel, and crushed stone) and 
water. Cement is the most expensive input in concrete."
1319,4," Concrete block is a construction material used in walls in residential and commercial buildings. Concrete blocks are produced 
in various shapes and sizes by pouring cement, aggregate, water, and other materials into molds, and then curing the molded 
blocks in a kiln. Plaintiffs use the capitalized form ""Concrete"" to refer to ready-mix concrete, mobile-mix concrete, and preformed blocks made of 
concrete. However, in this Order the term ""concrete"" is used only to refer to ready-mix concrete because most of the allegations 
of a concrete conspiracy pertain to ready-mix concrete. Where necessary, concrete block or mobile-mix concrete is referred to 
specifically. "
1320,5," Plaintiffs in the Direct Purchaser Action are Action Ready  [**20] Mix Concrete Inc. (""Action Ready Mix""), a purchaser of 
cement; Advantage Concrete of Florida, Inc. (""Advantage Concrete""), a purchaser of cement; Bay Area Remodelers, Inc. (""Bay 
Area Remodelers""), a purchaser of concrete; Carpenter Contractors of America, Inc. (""CCA""), a purchaser of concrete; Daniel 
Morgan Construction, Inc. (""Morgan Construction""), a purchaser of concrete; Family Pools, Inc. (""Family Pools""), a purchaser of 
concrete; Florida Block & Ready Mix (""Florida Block""), a purchaser of cement; Hard Rock Materials (""Hard Rock""), a purchaser 
of cement; Kroeger Enterprises, Inc. (""Kroeger""), a purchaser of cement and concrete; and Liberty Concrete and Masonry, Inc. 
(""Liberty""), a purchaser of cement and concrete. The Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs bring suit as a class under Federal Rule of Civil 
Procedure 23(a) and (b)(3), seeking to represent a cement class defined as all persons or entities that purchased cement 
directly from one or more of the Defendants or their co-conspirators in Florida between January 1, 2004 and the present. They 
also seek to represent a concrete class defined as all persons or entities who purchased concrete directly from one or more of 
the Defendants  [**21] or their co-conspirators in Florida between January 1, 2004 and the present."
1320,6," Plaintiffs in the Indirect Purchaser Action are Philip D. Sanford, who purchased cement and concrete indirectly from 
Defendants; Starfish, Inc., which indirectly purchased cement and concrete, including reinforced concrete pipe and concrete 
structures, from Defendants; and Sterling Development Company, which purchased cement and/or concrete indirectly from 
Defendants. The Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs bring suit as a class under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a) and (b)(3), 
seeking to represent a class defined as all persons who indirectly purchased cement or concrete deriving from any of the 
Defendants between January 1, 2004 and the present."
1320,7," The Defendants are identified as Cemex Inc. (""Cemex""), a producer and distributor of cement and concrete, having three 
cement plants, ten  [**22] cement import terminals, and 71 concrete suppliers in Florida; Cemex Materials, LLC and Cemex 
Construction Materials Florida, LLC (together ""Rinker""), which operated as Rinker in Florida until they were acquired by Cemex 
in 2007 and which sell cement and concrete in Florida; Preferred Materials, Inc. (""Preferred""), which purchased 21 former Rinker 
concrete suppliers, five former Cemex concrete suppliers, and six former Rinker concrete block plants to facilitate Cemex's 
acquisition of Rinker in 2007; Continental Florida Materials (""Continental""), which produces concrete and sells cement and 
concrete in Florida; Florida Rock Industries, Inc. (""Florida Rock""), which manufactures and sells cement and concrete, and 
operates one cement plant, two cement import terminals, and 63 concrete suppliers in Florida; and Tarmac America LLC 
(""Tarmac""), which operates one cement plant, one cement import terminal, and approximately 37 concrete suppliers in Florida; 
Prestige AB Management Co. LLC (""Prestige""), which manufactures and sells concrete and operates 31 concrete suppliers in 
Florida; Suwannee American Cement LLC (""Suwannee""), which sells cement and operates one cement plant in Florida; and 
 [**23] Votorantim Cimentos North America, Inc. (""VCNA""), which controls at least one cement plant, one cement import 
terminal, and several concrete suppliers and which conducts its business in Florida through entities which it controls, such as 
Co-Defendants Prestige and Suwannee. Plaintiffs also allege there are unnamed co-conspirators who participated in the acts 
complained of in the DSCAC. "
1321,8," The ICTCAC made minor changes to the Third Amended Consolidated Complaint [ECF No. 108], which had been filed on July 
12, 2010."
1321,9," Plaintiffs use the undifferentiated term ""Defendants"" throughout the DSCAC. Sometimes it is evident they mean either all of the 
Defendants or only some of the Defendants, but many times it is not clear whether all Defendants or some Defendants are 
intended. Rather than continue to struggle with the context to distinguish each occurrence, in this Order the Court also uses 
""Defendants"" throughout. "
1323,10, The Response notes this was before Cemex purchased Rinker. (See Resp. 15 (Direct [ECF No. 212])). 
1324,11," Mobile-mix trucks carry the ingredients for concrete to a job site separately and mix them on location. Because mobile-mix 
trucks mix concrete on site, their range is not restricted by the need to deliver concrete from a batch plant to a job site before the 
concrete hardens. The cost to transport cement itself still limits the range in which mobile-mix trucks are used. "
1325,12, The details of these arrangements are discussed in the analysis section. 
1328,13," It is curious that ""tacit agreement"" snuck its way into the Twombly decision. Tacit agreement in an oligopoly is simply 
conscious  [**51] parallelism, which the Supreme Court spent much of the Twombly decision describing as perfectly normal and 
not a violation of section 1. Section 1 of the Sherman Act does not reach ""tacit agreement;"" there must be an express preceding 
agreement in order for there to be a contract, combination, or conspiracy in restraint of trade. ""The courts are nearly unanimous 
in saying that mere interdependent parallelism does not establish the contract, combination, or conspiracy required by Sherman 
Act § 1."" Twombly, 550 U.S. at 554 (quoting VI Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, ANTITRUST LAW ¶ 1433a, at 236 (2d ed. 
2003)). "
1329,14," Actually, Defendants' conduct depends on their perceptions and observations of each other. The Supreme Court does not 
differentiate companies' parallel reactions to a common stimulus (such as an increase in price of a production input) from 
consciously parallel reactions to each other, such as price following. See Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, ANTITRUST 
LAW ¶ 307, at 69 (2d & 3d ed. Supp. 2010). There is a fundamental difference between all producers raising their prices because 
production has  [**56] become more expensive for each of them and producers raising their prices because one of them did; all 
things being equal, in the first situation, the price will tend toward the non-cooperative oligopoly price, which is known as the 
Cournot price, while in the second it will tend toward the monopoly price. See Herbert Hovenkamp, FEDERAL ANTITRUST POLICY 
§§ 4.2-4.3, at 159-66 (3d ed. 2005). However, the Supreme Court stated in Twombly that this special type of interdependent or 
conscious parallelism is perfectly consistent with legitimate business conduct. 550 U.S. at 553-54."
1329,15," ""One would ordinarily expect parallel pricing in . . . [a highly concentrated market], particularly if it is sequential — that is, if 
each firm is able to observe the prices of others before setting its own price. Of course, if prices are publicized simultaneously, 
as in a sealed bid auction, then identical prices become far more suspicious."" H. Hovenkamp § 4.5, at 176. Here, the price 
announcements as alleged by Plaintiffs were always sequential and public — suggesting conscious parallelism rather than prior 
agreement. Whether it is good policy to permit this type of price following is another question. If firms  [**57] in an oligopoly made production 
decisions based on their own marginal cost and marginal revenue curves (like in a competitive market) rather than pricing 
decisions based on prices announced by other firms, the result would tend toward the Cournot price and supply. The Cournot 
price is above the competitive price, but below the monopoly or cartel price, and correspondingly, the Cournot supply is below 
the competitive supply but above the monopoly or cartel supply. In an oligopoly, making pricing decisions based on price "
1330,," announcements by competitors rather than production decisions based on marginal cost and marginal revenue, results in higher 
prices and lower supply. Courts have consistently found that price following is rational and natural in a concentrated market and 
therefore, have approved it; but entering an agreement to fix prices is also rational and natural — it is just illegal. All things being 
equal, an antitrust policy which permits price following in an oligopoly will result in higher prices and lower supply than in a 
noncooperative oligopoly where firms make production decisions based on whether they will make more money by producing 
more. See generally H. Hovenkamp §§ 4.2-4.4,  [**58] at 159-73. "
1331,16, Wagner's statements with respect to these events are discussed separately below. 
1332,17," Presumably the explanation would go like this: Defendants are all concerned about ICPs competing for ready-mix concrete 
sales in the regions they dominate. Each Defendant, having identified this problem, separately concludes that if an independent 
trucker assists an ICP to carry ready-mix concrete into a region dominated by one of its vertically-integrated competitors, it will 
refuse to use that independent trucker for its own ready-mix transport because it assumes its competitors  [**67] will, having 
looked at the market, decide to do the same to help them. This level of strategic behavior sounds implausible even in the context 
of repeated dealings between Defendants. Morever, it is not clear how this type of coordination could be achieved without 
Defendants sharing some kind of blacklist that tracked which independent truckers were carrying concrete into what regions for 
which ICPs, or else by enormous overlapping surveillance efforts by all Defendants. "
1333,18," ""A tie-in, or tying arrangement, is a sale or lease of one product or service on the condition that the buyer take a second 
product or service as well."" H. Hovenkamp § 10.1, at 397. Plaintiffs do not allege a tying claim in addition to their conspiracy 
claim."
1333,19," Rinker, which supplied Morgan Construction with some of the concrete block it needed during the shortage, cut off sales of 
both concrete block and ready-mix to Morgan Construction when it discovered Morgan Construction was importing concrete 
block from out of state to meet the rest of its needs. (See DSCAC ¶ 116). In this specific instance, Rinker's actions may more 
properly be described as imposing a requirement of exclusive dealing on Morgan Construction rather than tying the purchase of 
block to readymix. "
1334,20," This would have also undermined the tying relationships set up by Defendants because it gave purchasers of concrete block a 
lower cost alternative source of block that was not tied to the purchase of ready-mix."
1334,21," In some cases, tying is not a legitimate business practice. However, Plaintiffs plead no claim for unlawful tying."
1334,22," At the hearing, the parties suggested the CID against VCNA has been withdrawn. "
1335,23," Defendants point to Twombly's proposition that ""a defendant seeking to respond to plaintiffs' conclusory allegations in the § 1 
 [**81] context would have little idea where to begin"" where the pleadings ""furnishe[d] no clue as to which of the four 
[defendants] (much less which of their employees) supposedly agreed, or when and where the illicit agreement took place."" 550 "
1336,," U.S. at 565, n.10. The Court notes Wagner's statements suggest a rough time frame for the timing of the agreement (sometime 
before the summer 2008 price increase announcements); they suggest which Defendants were involved (Cemex, Prestige, 
Florida Rock, and Tarmac); and they suggest Wagner was individually involved in making the agreement. These statements, 
along with some of the conduct alleged by Plaintiffs, are specific enough to reduce the enormous discovery burden that 
concerned the Supreme Court in Twombly. See id. at 558 (""[I]t is one thing to be cautious before dismissing an antitrust 
complaint in advance of discovery . . . but quite another to forget that proceeding to antitrust discovery can be expensive."") 
(internal citation omitted)."
1336,24," When considering a motion to dismiss  [**84] pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), the court may review any 
attached or incorporated documents that are central to the plaintiff's claim. See Kuehn v. The Cadle Co., No. 5:04-CV-432-OC-
10GRJ, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18205, 2006 WL 845085, *5 (M.D. Fla. March 30, 2006) (citing Brooks v. Blue Cross & Blue 
Shield of Fla., 116 F.3d 1364, 1368 (11th Cir. 1997)). "
1337,25," Defendants argue Plaintiffs' allegation that the existence of a concrete conspiracy depends on a cement conspiracy means if 
the Court finds no cement conspiracy is alleged then a concrete conspiracy is not plausible. However, horizontal price-fixing is a 
per se violation of section 1, and to state a claim under section 1 in a per se case, ""neither a relevant market nor an estimate of 
defendants' market power must be established in order to prove that the restraint is unlawful."" XI Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert 
Hovenkamp, ANTITRUST LAW ¶ 1910, at 280 (3d ed. 2007)."
1337,26, Special issues with respect to the liability of Preferred and VCNA are discussed below.
1337,27," These three named Plaintiffs seek to represent a ""Cement Indirect Class"" defined as, ""All persons or entities who purchased 
Cement indirectly from one or more of the Defendants or their co-conspirators in the state of Florida at any  [**89] time during 
the period of January 1, 2004 to the present."" (ICTCAC ¶ 61). They also seek to represent a ""Concrete Indirect Class"" defined "
1338,," as, ""All persons or entities who indirectly purchased Concrete which was sold originally either as Cement or Concrete by one or 
more of the Defendants or their co-conspirators or an Independent Concrete Producer . . . in the State of Florida at any time 
during the period January 1, 2004 to the present."" (Id. ¶ 62)."
1338,28," However, Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs may still (and do) seek injunctive relief under the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 26. "
1339,29," Plaintiffs also allege VCNA is liable for the antitrust conduct of its joint venture partner, the cement producer, Suwannee. 
Because the DSCAC does not adequately allege a cement conspiracy, it is not necessary to address VCNA's potential liability 
for Suwannee's conduct in the Florida cement market. "
1340,30," An agency relationship can also be based on apparent authority. ""Apparent authority exists when the principal creates the 
appearance of an agency relationship."" Whetstone Candy, 351 F.3d at 1078. But Plaintiffs allege  [**97] no facts suggesting the 
other alleged co-conspirators assumed Prestige had the authority to bind VCNA to the allege unlawful agreement."
1340,31," Cases cited by Plaintiffs are easily distinguished. Plaintiffs principally rely on Fitzpatrick v. Commonwealth Oil Co., 285 F.2d 
726 (5th Cir. 1960). In that case, unlike here, the subsidiary corporation was created solely for the purpose of entering and 
carrying out the contract at issue. See id. at 730. Plaintiffs also cite Doe v. Exxon Mobil Corp., which, in contrast to this case, 
was based on tort claims. 573 F. Supp. 2d 16, 31-32 (D.D.C. 2008) (concluding a reasonable trier of fact could find the three 
elements of the agency test satisfied with respect to the subsidiary's military security where the parent corporation designed, 
funded, and implemented a security policy that led to the torture and killing of civilians). Additionally, in Doe, the parent 
corporation almost completely controlled the subsidiary's security policy, rather than simply approving the subsidiary's decisions, 
as is alleged here. See id. In S & Davis Int'l, Inc. v. The Republic of Yemen, the alleged agent corporation was a political 
subdivision of the Republic of Yemen, which  [**98] had ""admitted that it '[was] an ""agency or instrumentality"" of The Republic of 
Yemen,'"" and the Republic of Yemen was alleged to have ordered the corporation to breach the contract at issue. 218 F.3d 
1292, 1298-99 (11th Cir. 2000). In this case, there are no facts alleged to suggest VCNA ordered Prestige to enter the alleged 
unlawful agreement. Specialty National Insurance Co. v. U-Save Auto Rental of America, Inc., applies a different agency standard than the one 
articulated by the Eleventh Circuit in Whetstone Candy. Specialty Nat'l Ins. Co., No. 8:07-CV-878-33MAP, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
94931, 2008 WL 4888864 at *9 (M.D. Fla. Nov. 12, 2008) (""To establish an agency relationship, the franchisor must have, by 
contract, action, or representation, 'directly or apparently participated in some substantial way in directing or managing acts of 
the franchisee.'"") (quoting Font v. Stanley Steemer Int'l, Inc., 849 So. 2d 1214, 1216 (Fla. 5th DCA 2003)). Moreover, in 
Specialty Nat'l Ins. Co., the court found the franchisor liable on an asset purchase agreement where evidence indicated the 
franchisor directly negotiated the asset purchase at issue on behalf of its franchisee. See 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 94931, [WL] at 
*10. Here, there are no allegations  [**99] VCNA directly negotiated the alleged unlawful agreement. Finally, the court in Norsul Oil & Min. Co., Ltd. v. Texaco, Inc., found parent corporations liable for subsidiaries' obligations with 
respect to underpayments of royalties where, in addition to the subsidiary CEO reporting to the parent companies, the 
subsidiaries refused to release royalty checks without parent approval, and a payment intended for one of the subsidiaries was 
made directly to one of the parent companies. 703 F. Supp. 1520, 1550 (S.D. Fla. 1988). In this case, there is no suggestion 
VCNA and Prestige mingled accounts as occurred in Norsul. "
1343,1," Given dismissal of Mr. Kanady's claims, this Court need not address GMAC's alternative F.R.Civ.P. 12(e) motion for a more 
definite statements. "
1344,2," Documents pertaining to Mr. Kanady's loan, default and foreclosure of the property were recorded with the Tulare County 
Official Records. "
1346,3," ""We have extended the 'incorporation by reference' doctrine to situations in which the plaintiff's claim depends on the contents 
of a document, the defendant attaches the document to its motion to dismiss, and the parties do not dispute the authenticity of 
the document, even though the plaintiff does not explicitly allege the contents of that document in the complaint."" Knievel v. 
ESPN, 393 F.3d 1068, 1076 (9th Cir. 2005) (citing Parrino, 146 F.3d at 706). "
1348,4," F.R.Civ.P. 9(b)'s particularity requirement applies to state law causes of action: ""[W]hile a federal court will examine state law to 
determine whether the elements of fraud have been pled sufficiently to state a cause of action, the Rule 9(b) requirement that 
the circumstances of the fraud must be stated with particularity is a federally imposed rule."" Vess v. Ciba-Geigy Corp. USA, 317 
F.3d 1097, 1103 (9th Cir. 2003) (quoting Hayduk v. Lanna, 775 F.2d 441, 443 (1st Cir. 1995)(italics in original))."
1348,5," ""In some cases, the plaintiff may allege a unified course of fraudulent conduct and rely entirely on that course of conduct as the 
basis of a claim. In that event, the claim is said to be 'grounded in fraud' or to 'sound in fraud,' and the pleading of that claim as a 
whole must satisfy the particularity requirement of Rule 9(b)."" Vess, 317 F.3d at 1103-1104. "
1372,*," District Judge Jed S. Rakoff of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation. "
1373,1," Brown & Williamson and R.J. Reynolds have since merged, forming Reynolds American, Inc."
1373,2," Four states -- Florida, Minnesota, Mississippi, and Texas -- settled litigation with the tobacco companies before the MSA was 
executed in 1998."
1373,3," By agreement of the parties, this sixty-day period was later expanded to ninety days. "
1374,4," If participating manufacturers lose more than 16-2/3% in market share, the decrease in payment obligations is calculated ""by a 
complex formula potentially  [**7] increasing the [participating manufacturers'] discount."" Freedom Holdings III, 447 F. Supp. 2d 
at 236. "
1375,5," This amendment to the Escrow Statute states: HN3[
] [T]o the extent that a tobacco product manufacturer establishes that the amount it was required to place into 
escrow on account of units sold in the state in a particular year was greater than the master settlement agreement 
payments, as determined pursuant to section IX(i) of the master settlement agreement including after final determination of 
all adjustments, that such manufacturer would have been required to make on account of such units sold had it been a 
participating manufacturer, the excess shall be released from escrow and revert back to such tobacco product 
manufacturer."" N.Y. Pub. Health Law § 1399-pp(2)(b)(ii) (emphasis added)."
1375,6," Defendants suggest that these laws are ""generally known as the directory statutes but referred to by plaintiffs as Contraband 
Statutes."" Appellees' Br. at 9. For the sake of consistency with prior opinions in this case, we use the term ""Contraband Statute"" 
to refer to the challenged provisions of the New York Tax Law."
1375,7," In so doing, we reserved a question not raised by plaintiffs' complaint: whether ""any sort of interstate regulatory gridlock would 
occur if many or every state adopted similar legislation."" Freedom Holdings I, 357 F.3d at 221 (internal quotation marks omitted)."
1375,8," In Grand River Enterprises Six Nations, Ltd. v. Pryor, 425 F.3d 158 (2d Cir. 2005), we held that the equal protection argument 
 [**12] raised by a similar group of NPM plaintiffs was ""unavailing because the Escrow Statutes are rationally related to a 
legitimate state interest: promoting public health and recovering the costs of tobacco-related illnesses,"" id. at 175. Plaintiffs have 
not pursued their equal protection claim either on remand or in this court. "
1377,9," The district court found the decline in market share between 2003 and 2007 explained by the fact that ""General Tobacco, the 
largest NPM to become a non-grandfathered SPM, joined the MSA in July 2004, which accounts for the fact that the SPMs' total 
market share has expanded slightly at the NPMs' expense in the years since."" Freedom Holdings VI, 592 F. Supp. 2d at 691 n.5. 
Further, the court observed that the data supplied by Pricewaterhouse Coopers likely ""understate[d] NPM sales because many 
NPMs sell cigarettes through the Internet or Indian reservations to avoid federal excise tax collection,"" which sales the 
accounting firm does not consider in identifying market shares. Id. at 692."
1377,10," The district court also cited the ""important public health goals and substantial fiscal benefits"" of the MSA regime, Freedom 
Holdings VI, 592 F. Supp. 2d at 700,  [**20] in concluding that it did not represent a ""naked"" restraint of trade lacking ""'any "
1378,," redeeming virtue,'"" id. at 696 (quoting Rice v. Norman Williams Co., 458 U.S. 654, 659 n.5, 102 S. Ct. 3294, 73 L. Ed. 2d 1042 
(1982)); see also Freedom Holdings III, 447 F. Supp. 2d at 248-54 (concluding per se rule should weigh social benefits of MSA). For the reasons stated infra at [22-35], we conclude that plaintiffs failed to prove their antitrust claim under a traditional 
application of the per se rule. Thus, we need not here decide whether a state's beneficent purpose can ever save an otherwise 
illegal restraint of trade from Sherman Act preemption. See National Soc'y of Prof'l Eng'rs v. United States, 435 U.S. 679, 692, 
98 S. Ct. 1355, 55 L. Ed. 2d 637 (1978) (observing that ""purpose of [antitrust] analysis is to form a judgment about the 
competitive significance of the restraint; it is not to decide whether a policy favoring competition is in the public interest, or in the 
interest of the members of an industry""); compare I Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law P 217b4, at 366-67 
(3d ed. 2006) (criticizing Freedom Holdings III for effectively applying rule of reason and remarking that ""[w]hether more or less 
cigarette smoking is healthy or unhealthy  [**21] is an important policy concern, but it is not one that is properly effected through 
the device of an unsupervised cartel agreement""), with Daniel A. Crane, Harmful Output in the Antitrust Domain: Lessons from 
the Tobacco Industry, 39 Ga. L. Rev. 321, 326 (2005) (noting that antitrust enforcement in tobacco industry has traditionally 
focused on increasing output but suggesting different considerations for ""net-harm industries"")."
1378,11," Accordingly, the district court also dissolved its preliminary injunction against enforcement of the allocable share release 
amendment to New York's Escrow Statute. "
1380,12," Some courts and commentators have observed that HN9[
] the two steps of inquiry may overlap. See, e.g., Costco Wholesale Corp. v. Maleng, 522 F.3d 874, 887-88 (9th Cir. 2008). To determine whether a statute mandates or authorizes a 
per se violation, a court must consider whether the challenged restraint ""ha[s] been unilaterally imposed by government."" Fisher 
v. City of Berkeley, 475 U.S. at 266. A finding of unilateral imposition ""effectively merge[s]"" into the state action immunity inquiry 
insofar as it concludes that the challenged statute does not delegate any unsupervised discretion to private parties. Costco 
Wholesale Corp. v. Maleng, 522 F.3d at 887; see also I Areeda & Hovenkamp, supra, P 217d, at 372 (noting that Fisher 
""use[d] Parker to show that the [challenged] ordinance passed the Rice test""); Merrick B. Garland, Antitrust and State Action: 
Economic Efficiency and the Political Process, 96 Yale L.J. 486, 507 (1987) (suggesting  [**29] that Fisher's ""preemption 
analysis collapses into the Midcal test""). Likewise, ""the 'state action' exemption from the antitrust laws simply expresses the 
conclusion that certain state laws are not preempted."" I Areeda & Hovenkamp, supra, P 217d, at 370."
1380,13," After Freedom Holdings I and Freedom Holdings II, the Supreme Court articulated a ""plausibility"" standard for reviewing the 
dismissal of a complaint. See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (""[A] complaint must contain 
sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.'"" (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. 
Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007)). "
1381,14," The district court suggested that this rule is limited to antitrust plaintiffs who seek treble damages under section 4 of the 
Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 15, and that standing analysis is more  [**33] flexible when an antitrust plaintiff seeks injunctive relief. 
See Freedom Holdings VI, 592 F. Supp. 2d at 693-95. We disagree. HN12[
] In the antitrust context, courts have articulated several ""efficient enforcer"" factors to avoid the ""duplicative recoveries"" 
that would result from allowing ""every person tangentially affected by an antitrust violation"" to sue for treble damages. Blue 
Shield of Va. v. McCready, 457 U.S. 465, 475-77, 102 S. Ct. 2540, 73 L. Ed. 2d 149 & n.11 (1982); see also Hawaii v. Standard 
Oil Co., 405 U.S. 251, 262 n.14, 92 S. Ct. 885, 31 L. Ed. 2d 184 (1972); Daniel v. Am. Bd. of Emergency Med., 428 F.3d 408, 
443-44 (2d Cir. 2005). Because ""one injunction is as effective as 100, and, concomitantly, . . . 100 injunctions are no more 
effective than one,"" Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co., 405 U.S. at 261, some of these factors are ""not relevant"" in suits for injunctive 
relief, Cargill, Inc. v. Monfort of Colo., Inc., 479 U.S. 104, 111 n.6, 107 S. Ct. 484, 93 L. Ed. 2d 427 (1986). But HN13[
] suits for injunctive relief, no less than suits for damages, require a plaintiff to demonstrate an ""injury in fact."" Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560, 112 S. Ct. 2130, 119 L. Ed. 2d 351 (1992). Morever, HN14[
] an antitrust plaintiff -- 
whether seeking relief in law or equity -- must demonstrate ""antitrust injury,"" the more subtle  [**34] details of which are not 
relevant here. See Cargill, Inc. v. Monfort of Colo., Inc., 479 U.S. at 113; see also Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, 
Inc., 395 U.S. 100, 130, 89 S. Ct. 1562, 23 L. Ed. 2d 129 (1969) (holding that plaintiff ""need only demonstrate a significant threat 
of injury from an impending violation of the antitrust laws""); Paycom Billing Servs., Inc. v. Mastercard Int'l, Inc., 467 F.3d 283, 
290 (2d Cir. 2006). Matsushita holds that a ""conspiracy by petitioners to charge higher than competitive prices . . . could not 
injure . . . competitors, [who] stand to gain from any conspiracy to raise the market price."" 475 U.S. at 583 (emphasis added). 
We construe this categorical pronouncement to apply equally to suits at law and equity. See generally Local Beauty Supply, Inc. 
v. Lamaur, Inc., 787 F.2d 1197, 1204 (7th Cir. 1986) (applying Matsushita rule in concluding that plaintiffs seeking equitable 
relief must also show ""antitrust injury""). As the Supreme Court has observed, ""[i]t would be anomalous . . . to read the Clayton 
Act to authorize a private plaintiff to secure an injunction against a threatened injury for which he would not be entitled to 
compensation if the injury actually occurred."" Cargill, Inc. v. Monfort of Colo., Inc., 479 U.S. at 112. "
1382,15," At the time these cases were decided, resale price maintenance was a per se violation of the Sherman Act. See Dr. Miles 
Med. Co. v. John D. Park & Sons Co., 220 U.S. 373, 31 S. Ct. 376, 55 L. Ed. 502 (1911). Recently, the Supreme Court overruled 
Dr. Miles and held that resale price maintenance agreements should be judged under the rule of reason. See Leegin Creative 
Leather Prods., Inc. v. PSKS, Inc., 551 U.S. at 907. We need not here decide whether state-mandated resale price maintenance 
would survive preemption analysis after Leegin. See Areeda & Hovenkamp, supra, P 217.1, at 7-9 (Supp. 2008). We cite the 
cases only as illustrative of hybrid restraints."
1382,16," We recognize that NPM payments are released from the state escrow fund to the extent they exceed payments that an NPM 
would have made if it had joined the MSA as an SPM. See N.Y. Pub. Health Law § 1399-pp(2)(b)(ii). Assuming arguendo that 
the MSA does penalize gains in SPM market share, see Freedom Holdings II, 363 F.3d at 153, an argument might be made that 
this release provision penalizes similar gains in NPM market share and, therefore, evidences a hybrid restraint, see KT&G Corp. 
v. Attorney Gen. of Okla., 535 F.3d 1114, 1130-31 (10th Cir. 2008). Like the Tenth Circuit, however, we think that such a 
connection to the conduct of private parties ""is too attenuated for this court to  [**39] conclude that [the state has] delegated 
regulatory power to . . . private individuals."" Id. at 1131. "
1387,17," We have no occasion to consider whether, to the extent a different plaintiff might have standing to challenge the MSA as 
distinct from the Escrow and Contraband Statutes, New York could offer a justification  [**58] for any alleged market division 
among MSA participants to satisfy the ancillary purpose of the first Midcal requirement. See Freedom Holdings III, 447 F. Supp. 
2d at 258 (observing that ""increased marginal costs to the SPMs above the grandfathered levels can be viewed as a means of 
recouping those funds which were lost to the states through the grandfather provision""). "
1390,18," HN39[
] A court may analyze a claim that a state statute is invalid because it regulates commerce extraterritorially either as a 
disproportionate burden on commerce under the balancing test set forth in Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U.S. at 142, or, as 
plaintiffs' claim requires here, ""independently . . . as a question of regulatory jurisdiction rather than one of regulatory 
discrimination,"" Freedom Holdings I, 357 F.3d at 216 n.11 (citing Healy v. Beer Inst., 491 U.S. at 336, and Edgar v. MITE Corp., 
457 U.S. 624, 643, 102 S. Ct. 2629, 73 L. Ed. 2d 269 (1982) (plurality opinion) (""The limits on a State's power to enact 
substantive legislation are similar to the limits on the jurisdiction of state courts. In either case, any attempt directly to assert 
extraterritorial jurisdiction over persons or property would offend sister States and exceed the inherent limits of the State's 
power."" (internal quotation marks omitted)). "
1392,19," Commentators have also cautioned that HN44[
] the Commerce Clause's ban on extraterritorial regulation must be applied carefully so as not to invalidate many state laws that have permissible extraterritorial effects. See generally Gillian E. Metzger, 
Congress, Article IV, and Interstate Relations, 120 Harv. L. Rev. 1468, 1521 (2007) (""[T]he extent of the prohibition on the states 
themselves should not be overstated. In practice, states exert regulatory control over each other all the time . . . . The prohibition 
on extraterritorial legislation is thus understood  [**81] only to constrain a state from formally asserting legal authority outside its 
borders . . . .""); Mark D. Rosen, Extraterritoriality and Political Heterogeneity in American Federalism, 150 U. Pa. L. Rev. 855, 
919-30 (2002) (arguing that ban on extraterritorial regulation applies only to protectionist laws, regulations of non-citizens, and 
inconsistent regulations); Jack L. Goldsmith & Alan O. Sykes, The Internet and the Dormant Commerce Clause, 110 Yale L.J. 
785, 795 (2001) (""Innumerable state laws affect outsiders, and no one thinks that all (or even most) of these laws violate the 
dormant Commerce Clause.""). "
1395,1, Subsequent to that dismissal the action was reassigned to the undersigned.
1395,2," On the same day its motion to dismiss was filed, Ganz sought leave for both the opening brief and the opposition brief to be up 
to 35 pages in length. Generally, a request to exceed page limits should be made prior to the filing of an over-long brief. See, 
e.g., Civil Local Rule 7-4 (b). While rule violations, however minor, are not condoned, here the opening brief exceeded the 
standard page limit by less than a page, and the opposition brief was less than two pages over the limit. Accordingly, the motion 
for leave to exceed page limits will, in this one instance, be granted post hoc. "
1396,3," At oral argument, plaintiffs urged the Court to look to Cascade, rather than Rick-Mik, asserting that it is more recent, and 
therefore controlling. Rick-Mik is actually the later of the two decisions, albeit only by a few months. Both decisions summarize 
the general legal principles applicable to tying arrangements in essentially the same way. "
1397,4," In the prior motion to dismiss, Ganz suggested that plaintiffs had not sufficiently alleged a tying requirement because they only 
stated that the Ganz core product line ""included"" products in the four submarkets, thereby implying that plaintiffs may have been 
able to satisfy the requirement to purchase core products by ordering items that did not fall into any of the four submarkets. 
Ganz has not pressed this argument in the present motion."
1397,5," Furthermore, the SACC contains at least some comparative sales estimates. See ¶¶ 58-61. "
1399,6," At oral argument, plaintiffs suggested that the California statute permits claims based on any underlying ""unlawful"" act, and that 
therefore an antitrust violation could give rise to an UCL claim. Even assuming plaintiffs could satisfy the requisite consumer 
injury under such a theory, their UCL count simply does not plead any claim based on antitrust, and they did not request leave to 
amend  [*21] to include such a claim."
1399,7," Apparently the popularity of particular Webkinz toys is relatively short-lived, making timely deliveries of particular importance. "
1404,1," This claim fails at the outset against Frank Marvin in his individual capacity in that Plaintiff has not alleged any facts that would 
show the existence of any contract with Mr. Marvin personally, as opposed to with the corporation."
1404,2," This claim as asserted against the individual Defendants also fails. All actions taken by the individual Defendants are alleged to 
have been in their capacities as agents of the various corporate entities acting within the scope of their authority in furtherance of 
corporate interests, which does not subject them to individual liability. Leonard v. McMorris, 63 P.3d 323, 330 (Colo. 2003). The 
individual Defendants had no duties to Plaintiff in their individual capacities to provide him with quotes or assist his business; 
they were only obligated to do so as representatives of Marvin or BMG. "
1411,1," Plaintiff alleges six state law claims: (1) defamation, (2) breach of contract, (3) tortious interference of a prospective economic 
advantage, (4) civil conspiracy, (5) negligent infliction of emotional distress, and (6) intentional infliction of emotional distress. "
1415,1," The HONORABLE JEAN C. HAMILTON, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Missouri."
1415,2," The Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, 15 U.S.C. § 18a, required premerger notification and submission of relevant documents to the

1417,3," HN3[
] As a general rule, a Rule 12(c) motion for judgment on the pleadings is reviewed under the same standard as a"
1417,12," (b)(6) motion to dismiss. See Clemons v. Crawford, 585 F.3d 1119, 1124 (8th Cir. 2009), cert. denied, 130 S. Ct. 3507, 177 L. 
Ed. 2d 1092 (2010). But what effect on this standard, if any, does the fact that Defendants' Rule 12(c) motion was timely made 
after denial of Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction -- an exercise that generated a record outside the pleadings of some 
400,000 document pages? The parties cite no case addressing this unusual procedural issue. "
1418,4," HN11[
] ""Courts must exercise care to ensure that the cost of correcting the market failure does not exceed the 
anticompetitive injury visited on consumers."" E. Thomas Sullivan, The Jurisprudence of Antitrust Divestiture: The Path Less 
Traveled, 86 Minn. L. Rev. 565, 613 (2002). "
1423,1," Plaintiffs appear to argue that Congress intended to grant particularly substantial deference to their choice of forum due to their 
claims under the Sherman Act, which contains a broad venue provision. See 15 U.S.C. § 22. However, Section 1404 ""applies to 
actions governed by special venue provisions,"" such as 15 U.S.C. § 22.  [*7] See Savage, 611 F.2d at 279 (citing Ex parte 
Collett, 337 U.S. 55, 58-59, 69 S. Ct. 944, 93 L. Ed. 1207 (1949)). Thus, even where a plaintiff brings its action in a proper 
venue, Section 1404(a) concerns a ""separate and distinct problem[]."" Collett, 337 U.S. at 60. The broad venue provision of 15 
U.S.C. § 22 does not alter the Court's Section 1404 analysis, and Plaintiffs' choice of venue is not entitled to especially strong 
deference merely because Plaintiffs have alleged Sherman Act violations. See United States v. Nat'l City Lines, Inc., 337 U.S. 
78, 80-82, 69 S. Ct. 955, 93 L. Ed. 1226 (1949). "
1426,2," This is made especially clear by the fact that Plaintiffs have listed many of these executives on their witness list. (See Straus 
Decl. at Ex. A.) "
1430,1," Static Control then filed a second suit, a declaratory judgment action. [5:04-084, R. 1.] The cases were consolidated, and it is 
the later case, 04-084, that became the lead case; it is the case to which all record citations refer unless otherwise noted."
1430,2," Lexmark settled its claims of direct infringement against these three remanufacturers out of court. During trial, the Court held as 
a matter of law that Lexmark had satisfied its burden of proving direct infringement with respect to Wazana Brothers, NER, and 
Pendl. [R. 1245.] "
1432,3," During the trial, the Court found Static Control liable for direct infringement of Lexmark's '015 patent as a matter of law. [R. 
1376 at 16-20 (Tr. June 20, 2007).]"
1432,4, The Court adopts its reasoning in Record No. 1430 as if fully set forth herein.
1432,5," Static Control creatively argues that Lexmark's motion for a new trial is untimely to the extent it challenges jury issues not 
decided by the verdict. Static Control is correct that the jury did not answer Questions Nos. 2.1, 3.1, 3.2, and 4 in Part I of the 
Special Verdict Form. Without getting into the mechanics of Static Control's  [**20] argument, however, the Court notes that the 
jury did not answer those questions because it was instructed not to do so in light of its answers to Question Nos. 1 and 2.2. 
Thus, the jury's failure to answer those questions was an answer in and of itself, and those issues were decided by the verdict. "
1433,6," Page numbers correspond with the numbers on the original document, not the cm/ecf page numbers imposed by the Court 
upon filing."
1433,7," Like Lexmark, Wazana Brothers, NER, and Pendl also proposed separating the trial into three phases. [See R. 718.] Under 
their proposal,  [**22] however, the issue of patent misuse would have been tried first, with Lexmark's affirmative claims of 
patent infringement coming in the second phase of the trial. [See id. at 2-3.] The trial would have concluded with evidence 
regarding damages, including evidence on the issue of willful infringement. [Id. at 3.] "
1438,8," Two minor statements by the Court appear inconsistent with Broadcom, which, again, was decided after the trial of this matter 
was completed. At trial, outside the presence of the jury, the Court did state, ""I don't think it's fair to argue as it relates to intent 
that the mere absence of seeking counsel can be–a negative inference can go to that."" [R. 1269 at 180 (Tr. June 5, 2007).] 
Further, in a footnote in Record No. 1082 the Court rejected Lexmark's argument that it was entitled to know if a consultation 
with counsel occurred and an opinion existed. [R. 1082 at 13 n. 2.] But these statements must  [**39] be read in the context of 
the Court's ultimate ruling at Record No. 1082 in accordance with Knorr-Bremse. See supra at 17. Further, the Court provided 
sufficient leniency to Lexmark's counsel to question Static Control CEO Ed Swartz about opinions of counsel sought or received 
to correct any error in its prior statements. See supra at 18."
1438,9," Dr. Vistnes did not render an opinion an misuse. [See R. 1313 at 34.] Rather, he assumed patent misuse on the part of 
Lexmark, and rendered opinions about the competitive affect of that misue. [See id.] "
1440,10, Tom Lamb's statement was admitted as the admission of a party-opponent. [See R. 1277 at 10-11.] 
1441,11," Moreover, the Court notes that ultimately no decision was made regarding the application of Static Control's estoppel defense. 
The Court exercised its discretion not to rule on the equitable defenses, based in part on the jury's finding of non-infringement. 
[See R. 1430 at 13-16.] "
1442,12," The Court notes that the jury, working in its advisory capacity, found in favor of Lexmark on Static Control's mislabeling theory 
of patent misuse, as it determined that the language on Lexmark's non-Prebate cartridge labels is not ""clearly false."" [R. 1366 at 
13.] "
1443,13," Technically, counsel for Static Control remarked that ""[w]hen the customer doesn't win, a company in Lexmark's position 
becomes a monopolist, gets closer and closer to or perhaps even achieves a 100 percent market share."" [R. 1379 at B-15 (Tr. 
June 21, 2007) (emphasis added).] "
1455,1," Specifically, the Levines claim the “Complaint seeks to compel Blue Shield to make full and individualized disclosure of crucial 
specific facts known only to Blue Shield, but routinely withheld from consumers: the actual and lower amounts Blue Shield is 
willing to accept from consumers for health care coverage.”"
1455,2," On appeal, the Levines also claim that the class allegations in their complaint should not be stricken. In light of our conclusion 
that the trial court properly sustained Blue Shield's demurrer without leave to amend, we need not consider the Levines' claim 
concerning the class allegations in the first amended complaint."
1455,3," With respect to their use of the terms “health plans” and “health insurance policies,” the Levines stated that Blue Shield and its 
wholly owned subsidiary, Blue Shield of California Health and Life Insurance Company, jointly market both managed care health 
plans and health insurance policies. "
1456,4," Section 332 provides: “Each party to a contract of insurance shall communicate to the other, in good faith, all facts within his 
knowledge which are or which he believes to be material to the contract and as to which he makes no warranty, and which the 
other has not the means of ascertaining.”"
1456,5," In support of its demurrer, Blue Shield requested that the trial court take judicial notice of a redacted copy of Victoria's 
application. The Levines opposed Blue Shield's request. The trial court denied Blue Shield's request for judicial notice. On 
appeal, Blue Shield has filed a new motion for judicial notice, requesting that this court take judicial notice of the application. The 
Levines filed a notice of nonopposition to Blue Shield's request. We grant Blue Shield's request, and take judicial notice of the 
redacted copy of Victoria's application that is contained in the record. "
1457,6," In their opposition to Blue Shield's demurrer, the Levines stated that they did not oppose the demurrer to their cause  [***11] of 
action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. "
1458,7," As  [***15] stated in their brief, Blue Shield allegedly owed the Levines a duty to reveal “the actual amount of premiums Blue 
Shield is willing to accept for health care coverage.”"
1458,8," Neither party cited California Service Station in its brief on appeal. This court requested that the parties submit supplemental 
briefs concerning the relevance, if any, of California Service Station to the issues in this appeal. The parties filed supplemental 
 [***17] briefs in response to our request. "
1459,9," Two subsidiaries of the association also were named plaintiffs in the action. (California Service Station, supra, 62 
Cal.App.4th at p. 1169.) Since the distinctions among these entities are not relevant for the present appeal, we refer to the 
association and its subsidiaries as “the association,” for ease of reference."
1459,10," As with the plaintiffs in California Service Station, the Levines do not claim that Blue Shield breached any duty related to the 
disclosure of information pertaining  [***21] to coverage. "
1460,11," The Levines have not alleged that Blue Shield failed to disclose the price of the health care plans and insurance policy that the 
Levines purchased. "
1462,12," The Levines and Blue Shield have both requested that we take judicial notice of portions of the legislative history of provisions 
in the Insurance Code, in support of their competing contentions concerning whether the Insurance Code applies to Blue Shield. 
Because we have assumed, for purposes of this opinion, that the Insurance Code applies to Blue Shield—an assumption we 
make strictly for purposes of resolving this appeal—we deny the requests for judicial notice as moot."
1462,13, The text of Insurance Code section 332 was originally enacted by the Legislature in 1872 as Civil Code former section 2563.
1462,14," We observe that a policy that designated Victoria as the primary insured and added the two dependents would not be the 
“exact same policy” as the one that the Levines originally purchased. "
1463,15," The Levines' interpretation of section 332 would lead to absurd results. If, as the Levines contend, an insurer is under a 
statutory duty to disclose that it is willing to offer the same coverage at a lower cost in light of the reciprocal nature of section 332 
(Pastoria, supra, 112 Cal.App.4th at p. 1499),  [***35] a purchaser of insurance would have a corresponding duty to inform the 
insurer that it would be willing to purchase the same coverage at a higher cost. We decline to adopt such a bizarre and 
impractical interpretation of section 332. (See Commission on Peace Officer Standards & Training v. Superior Court (2007) 42 
Cal.4th 278, 290 [64 Cal. Rptr. 3d 661, 165 P.3d 462] [statutes should be interpreted to avoid “unreasonable, impractical, or 
arbitrary results”].)"
1463,16," In light of our conclusion that Blue Shield did not owe the Levines a duty of disclosure, we need not consider whether we may 
affirm the judgment on the ground that Blue Shield met any such duty as a matter of law by including the following notice in 
Victoria's application: “Indicating the younger spouse/domestic partner as the primary applicant may reduce your monthly 
dues/payments.” "
1464,17," In discussing their UCL claim, the Levines note that they have requested that this court take judicial notice of a consent 
agreement entered into between “Anthem Health Plans of Maine, Inc. d/b/a  [***39] Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield 
(‘Anthem’)” and various officials of the Maine state government (the Consent Agreement). The Consent Agreement states in 
relevant part: “In a November 8, 2002 Decision and Order regarding Anthem's filing, the Superintendent [of the Maine Bureau of 
Insurance] changed the way rates are determined for contracts covering two adults (with or without children). The new method 
bases rates on the age of the primary policyholder only. Previously, the rates reflected the ages of both adults. Therefore, while 
it had previously made little difference which spouse was designated as primary insured, it is now advantageous for 
policyholders to designate the younger spouse as the primary insured. In order to make policyholders aware of this, the 
Superintendent provided, at Part V, P 3 of his November 2002 Decision and Order: [¶] ‘Anthem … shall take vigilant measures 
to ensure that affected policyholders under mixed-age contracts are aware of their opportunity to make the younger spouse the 
policyholder … .’ ” The Consent Agreement also states that Anthem failed to provide the notice required in the November 2002 
order. Blue Shield opposes the Levines' request  [***40] for judicial notice. In addition, Blue Shield requests that we take judicial notice 
of several additional documents in support of Blue Shield's contention that it “is an independent corporation, existing and 
organized under the laws of the State of California.” The Levines, in turn, objected to Blue Shield's request for judicial notice. The Levines have not demonstrated the relationship, if any, between Anthem and Blue Shield. Further, the Levines have not 
alleged, nor indicated that they could allege, that any of the circumstances that gave rise to the Consent Agreement exist in 
California. Specifically, the Levines have not alleged any facts concerning the manner by which Blue Shield's rates are regulated 
in California. Nor have the Levines alleged that a regulatory agency has directed Blue Shield to provide notice to policyholders 
concerning their opportunity to list the younger spouse as the primary policyholder. The Levines thus have not demonstrated that 
the Consent Agreement has any relevance to this action. Accordingly, we deny the Levines' request for judicial notice. (See 
Mangini v. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. (1994) 7 Cal.4th 1057, 1063 [31 Cal. Rptr. 2d 358, 875 P.2d 73] [stating that only 
relevant material  [***41] may be judicially noticed], overruled on another ground in In re Tobacco Cases II (2007) 41 Cal.4th 
1257, 1276 [63 Cal. Rptr. 3d 418, 163 P.3d 106].) We deny as moot Blue Shield's request for judicial notice filed in opposition to 
the Levines' request. "

from the same DOJ investigation into anticompetitive conduct within the processed tomato industry, but he declined to 
consolidate that case with the other cases because, in that case, the plaintiffs are suing defendants as direct competitors

therefore justifying the government's argument that his detention would likely accelerate trial, defendant Salyer was released on 
bail on September 3, 2010."
1492,8," This finding is bolstered by the fact that during the parties' negotiations regarding the government's stay request, plaintiffs 
agreed to a six month limited stay of discovery. Also, although plaintiffs propose that, as an alternative to a blanket stay of 
discovery, the court address the interests of the parties with regard to specific discovery disputes, such  [*18] a proposal would 
be inefficient for the parties and the court. "
1504,1," These well-pleaded facts are taken from Automation's complaint and are considered as true for the purposes of this 
Memorandum and Opinion. See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 1949-50, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009); Neitzke v. Williams, 490 
U.S. 319, 326, 109 S. Ct. 1827, 104 L. Ed. 2d 338 (1989)."
1504,2," This practice has led to several on-going disputes between Emerson and Automation, with Emerson contending Automation's 
failure to remove Emerson's marks amounts to a trademark violation. The latest iteration of this dispute ended in a settlement 
between the parties  [**5] and a release of their claims for any activities before December 13, 2007. "
1506,3," Because HN5[
] Missouri antitrust law is to be ""construed in harmony with ruling judicial interpretations of comparable federal antitrust statutes,"" Mo. Stat. Ann. § 416.141, I will apply the same federal law  [**12] to the Missouri antitrust claims that I 
apply to the federal antitrust claims. "
1507,4," In its complaint, Automation does allege: ""Emerson has been a strong proponent of the FM OEM Agreement Requirement."" But 
this statement is conclusory, and without any factual allegations supporting it, I need not accept it as true. See Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. 
at 1949-50. I have disregarded other conclusory statements for the purposes of my analysis. "
1508,5," Automation's failure to plausibly allege a prior agreement also makes irrelevant its arguments about the reasonableness of 
FM's OEM Agreement requirement. See DM Research v. College of Am. Pathologists, 170 F.3d 53, 54-56 (1st Cir. 1999) (even 
assuming arguendo that plaintiff could ultimately prove at trial that defendant's safety guideline was unnecessary, plaintiff failed 
to state a Section 1 claim when it failed to plausibly allege an agreement between defendants to create the guideline in order to 
restrain trade). "
1509,6," Because this failure is fatal to Automation's Section 2 claims, I need not determine whether Automation has plausibly alleged 
Emerson's anticompetitive behavior or its own antitrust injury. "
1511,7," I have serious doubts as well about whether Automation has adequately alleged that the relevant market should be limited to 
the aftermarket for Emerson products. Specifically, Automation fails to include any of the factual allegations  [**33] found in 
complaints in cases in which courts have limited the relevant market to the aftermarket. See, e.g., Harrison Aire, Inc. v. Aerostar 
Int'l, Inc., 423 F.3d 374, 383 (3d Cir. 2005) (factors include (1) supracompetitive pricing, (2) defendant's dominant share of the 
relevant aftermarket; (3) significant information costs that prevented life-cycle pricing by primary market consumers; and (4) high 
""switching costs"" that serve to ""lock in"" a defendant's aftermarket customers). For instance, Automation does not plead that 
Emerson has changed anything in its business relationship with consumers after consumers have already purchased Emerson 
equipment and are ""locked in"" without any choice for switching products, such as forcing its customers to sign contracts 
requiring them to purchase only its Encore brand of remanufactured products before it will agree to service their products. 
Compare Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Technical Servs., Inc., 504 U.S. 451, 458, 112 S. Ct. 2072, 119 L. Ed. 2d 265 (""In 1985 
and 1986, Kodak implemented a policy of selling replacement parts for micrographic and copying machines only to buyers of 
Kodak equipment who use Kodak service or repair their own machines.""). Instead, Automation alleges  [**34] that ""the 
emergence of a Remanufactured . . . market drives down the retail price of new Valves [sic] Assemblies, Components and 
Instrumentation."" In the face of Automation's assertion that activities in the aftermarket affect prices in the primary market — in 
effect, that the two markets have such an information exchange that what happens in one affects what happens in the other, I 
have doubts that the market should be so limited. Cf. SMS Sys. Maint. Servs., Inc. v. Digital Equip. Corp., 188 F.3d 11, 19 (1st 
Cir. 1999) (""Given that the primary market's ability to check a firm's behavior in its own aftermarket hinges in substantial part on 
whether information about the latter is sufficiently reflected in the former, the transparency of DEC's allegedly monopolistic policy 
represents a salient departure from the Kodak scenario.""). In any event, Automation has failed to plausibly allege any monopoly 
power or dangerous probability of monopoly power by Emerson, and its Section 2 claims must be dismissed. "
1513,8," Emerson also argues that these statements cannot form the basis of any Lanham Act liability, because none of them mention 
Automation or its products by name. This argument misses the mark. While the statements do not mention Automation or its 
products by name, they do name Emerson's own Encore brand of remanufactured products and assert the superior safety of 
those products compared to other remanufacturer's, and it is well established that HN22[
] a plaintiff may bring a Lanham Act action based on a defendant's false statements about its own products. See 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a); see also, e.g., Clorox Co. P.R. 
v. Proctor & Gamble Commercial Co., 228 F.3d 24, 34-35 (1st Cir. 2000) (plaintiff, manufacturer of chlorine bleach,  [**42] stated 
a claim under the Lanham Act when defendant claimed its laundry detergent made clothes whiter than chlorine bleach). "
1527,1," SHC is the corporate parent of Kmart. (See Kmart's Rule 7.1 Corp. Disclosure Statement.) SHC, however, denies that it 
operates any Kmart department stores. (See SHC's Ans. ¶¶ 8-9.)"
1527,2," On September 30, 2010, Plaintiffs filed their Second Amended Complaint. However, the parties had fully briefed Plaintiffs' 
Motion to Strike, which this court is now deciding, before the Second Amended Complaint was filed, and the issues here are "
1528,," unaffected because Plaintiffs only added new claims against Kmart and SHC and did not modify any of the claims that they 
asserted in their First Amended Complaint."
1528,3," Plaintiffs did not initially move to strike 24 Seven's Second and Third Affirmative Defenses, but added this request to their reply 
brief in light of Defendants' response to Plaintiffs' motion. (See Pls.' Rep. Memo. at 5.) "
1533,4," In addition, 24 Seven's assertion is circular; if Plaintiffs goods are not counterfeit, regardless of whether or not Plaintiffs knew 
this, then Plaintiffs  [**20] would not be entitled to any equitable relief and the unclean hands defense would be superfluous. "
1534,5," Notably, this defense is most commonly applied in breach of contract and tort actions. See e.g., Cornell v. T. V. Dev. Corp., 17 
N.Y.2d 69, 74, 215 N.E.2d 349, 268 N.Y.S.2d 29 (N.Y. 1966) (applying  [**22] failure to mitigate damages defense in breach of 
contract action); Dombrowski v. Moore, 299 A.D.2d 949, 951, 752 N.Y.S.2d 183, (N.Y.Sup.Ct. 2002)(applying failure to 
mitigate damages defense in medical malpractice action seeking damages for personal injury). Defendants have not cited to, 
and this Court has not found, any case applying a mitigation of damages defense to claims similar to those asserted by Plaintiffs. "
1537,1," The foregoing is a simplified summary of the facts. Additional facts developed in the course of Defendants' motions for 
summary judgment will be recounted below, as pertinent to the issues Plaintiffs raise on appeal. "
1538,2," Our summary of Plaintiffs' allegations is based on the Third Amended Complaint, which is the operative pleading in this matter. 
The defendants named in the Third Amended Complaint include HASC, Catholic Healthcare West, Kindred Hospitals West, 
L.L.C, West Hills Hospital & Medical Center, Glendale Adventist Medical Center, Simi Valley Hospital & Health Care Services, 
South Coast Medical Center, White Memorial Medical Center and ""DOES 1-100."" Earlier versions of the complaint named 
additional individual plaintiffs and defendants."
1538,3," This cause of action does not appear in the Third Amended Complaint because the trial court previously sustained a demurrer 
to that claim on standing grounds. The issues concerning the demurrer are discussed below. "
1540,4," Aguilar's holding was based on Matsushita Elec. Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp. (1986) 475 U.S. 574, in which the United 
States Supreme Court described how courts should analyze motions for summary judgment involving claims arising under the 
federal antitrust statute, commonly referred to as the Sherman Act. (Aguilar, supra, 25 Cal.4th at pp. 846-847, 851-852.) Prior to 
Aguilar, the California Supreme Court acknowledged that ""the Cartwright Act is patterned after the Sherman Act and both 
statutes have their roots in the common law. Consequently, federal cases interpreting the Sherman Act are applicable to 
problems arising under the  [*15] Cartwright Act."" (Marin County Bd. of Realtors, Inc. v. Palsson (1976) 16 Cal.3d 920, 925; see 
also Redwood Theatres, Inc. v. Festival Enterprises, Inc. (1988) 200 Cal.App.3d 687, 694 [because ""relevant case law under the 
Cartwright Act is comparatively sparse,"" state decisions involving Cartwright Act claims often ""rely chiefly on federal [antitrust] "
1541,," decisions""].) Consistent with these holdings, our decision relies on both state decisions interpreting the Cartwright Act and 
federal decisions interpreting the Sherman Act. "
1542,5," Plaintiffs do not allege that the Defendants conspired to force employees to choose between an eight-hour shift or a 12-hour 
shift with an equivalency pay reduction. Instead, they allege only that the Hospital Defendants conspired to impose equivalency 
pay reductions. "
1543,6," In a related argument, Plaintiffs contend that they need not show that Defendants engaged in ""identical changes,"" but only that 
Defendants altered their normal pricing patterns (in this case nurse wage levels) in some manner. In support, it cites cases ruling 
that deviations from an agreed upon course of conduct by some conspirators is insufficient to defeat an antitrust claim. As a 
preliminary matter, the cases Plaintiffs cite involved direct evidence of collusion, not circumstantial evidence predicated on 
conscious parallelism, and are therefore of limited relevance. (See, e.g., Plymouth Dealers' Assn. v. United States (9th Cir. 
1960) 279 F.2d 128, 130-131 [defendants admitted they had ""agree[d] on a fixed uniform list price"" but argued such an 
agreement did not, standing alone, constitute violation of antitrust laws]; United States v. Utah Pharm. Assn. (D. Utah 1962) 201 
F.Supp 29, 34-35 [direct evidence established ""adoption, publication and distribution of the price schedule""]; Catalano, Inc. v. 
Target Sales, Inc. (1980) 446 U.S. 643, 644 [accepting as true allegation that ""wholesalers secretly agreed, in  [*26] order to 
eliminate competition among themselves, that . . . they would sell to retailers only if payment were made in advance or upon 
delivery].) Moreover, in this case we are analyzing whether Defendants' conduct is sufficiently uniform to raise an inference of 
collusion, not whether minor deviations from a proven agreement are fatal to an antitrust claim. Finally, as we have discussed, 
the evidence here does not merely show slight differences between the Defendants' conduct; rather, it shows that almost half of 
the Hospital Defendants did not adopt equivalency pay reductions and half did so only after an employee vote. "
1544,7," Both parties acknowledge that the trial court sustained foundational evidentiary objections to a significant portion of Plaintiffs' 
evidence but went on to consider these exhibits in ruling on the motions for summary judgment. Because the trial court 
considered these exhibits, and no party has objected to its decision to do so, we do the same."
1544,8," The record does contain evidence suggesting that one non-defendant hospital considered competitor conduct in formulating a 
response to AB 60. In deposition testimony, two employees of Tenet Hospital, who is  [*31] not a defendant in this lawsuit, 
stated that, in making the decision to impose equivalency pay reductions, information regarding competitor conduct was ""of 
interest to us."" It is unclear whether evidence showing that employees of a single non-defendant hospital considered its 
competitors' conduct in imposing equivalency pay reductions would be sufficient to infer that the Hospital Defendants acted in a 
similar matter. (See, e.g., Clamp-All Corp. v. Cast Iron Soil Pipe Institute (1st Cir. 1988) 851 F.2d 478, 484 [""jury could not find, 
without impermissible speculation, that . . . defendants priced couplings below their costs"" based on evidence showing price list "
1545,," of competitor's couplings]."") However, because Plaintiffs' have not argued that the evidence supports such and an inference or 
that the Hospital Defendants actually relied on their awareness of competitor conduct, we need not address the issue. (See 
Paterno v. State of California (1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 68, 106 [""court is not required to examine undeveloped claims, nor to make 
arguments for parties""].)"
1545,9," Plaintiffs also cite extensive evidence indicating that hospitals were under competitive pressure to retain 12-hour shifts because 
nurses preferred 12-hour shifts to eight-hour shifts. Plaintiffs' antitrust claim, however, is not that the hospitals conspired to retain 
a 12-hour shift but rather that they conspired to adopt equivalency pay reductions. "
1547,10," In contrast to this case, Toys ""R"" Us v. FTC (7th Cir. 2000) 221 F.3d 928, 932 (Toys ""R"" Us) presents a paradigm example of 
an antitrust case in which the plaintiff introduced sufficient evidence that defendants acted against self interest. Plaintiffs, who 
were a group of warehouse clubs that sold items at a lower markup than traditional retail outlets, alleged that Toy's R Us (TRU) 
and several toy manufacturers had entered into a collusive agreement not to sell items to warehouse clubs that they sold to 
TRU. Internal documentation from the manufacturers revealed that, prior to  [*43] their agreements with TRU, the toy retailers 
""were trying to expand, not to restrict, the number of their major retail outlets and to reduce their dependence on TRU. They 
were specifically interested in cultivating a relationship with the warehouse clubs and increasing sales there."" (Id. at p. 932.) As a 
result, ""the sudden adoption of measures under which they decreased sales to the clubs ran against their independent economic 
self-interest."" (Ibid.) No comparable evidence is present here. "
1549,11," Plaintiffs argue that, by informing each other how they intended to respond to AB 60, hospitals effectively exchanged future 
pricing information. However, merely stating an intention to adopt (or not adopt) an equivalency pay reduction cannot be equated 
with sharing future salary or wage pricing information because there is no evidence that hospitals told each other how much they 
were actually paying their nurses. "
1550,12," Although AB 60 went into effect on January 1, 2000, it contained an exemption for 12-hour shifts in hospital if they were put in 
and legal prior to 1998. This exemption only lasted until July 1, 2000, and was intended to provide the IWC time to study and 
determine whether or not to continue them and under what terms and conditions. "
1551,13," Even if Plaintiffs' interpretation was the only plausible interpretation of the HR representative's statements, courts have 
repeatedly held that ""evidence of sporadic exchanges of shop talk"" is generally insufficient to survive summary judgment on an 
antitrust claim. (Baby Food, supra, 164 F.3d at p. 125.) "
1552,14," Plaintiffs rely primarily on six cases that, in their view, require a reversal here. In four of the cases, there was substantial 
evidence that defendants engaged in uniform behavior that could not be explained by any benign motive. That element is wholly 
lacking here. (See Flat Glass, supra, 385 F.3d at p. 362 [inference of price fixing agreement reasonable where ""no evidence 
suggests that the increase in . . . prices was correlated with any changes in costs or demand"" and cooperating witness provided "
1553,," proffer that numerous companies had entered into ""an agreed upon, across the board price increase for the entire United 
States""]; Interstate Circuit v. United States (1939) 306 U.S. 208, 222 [inference of agreement reasonable where, after receiving 
identical request from major supplier, Defendants engaged in uniform conduct that  [*63] amounted to ""radical departure from 
the previous business practices of the industry and a drastic increase in . . . prices"" that could not be explained by benign 
motive]; Toys ""R"" Us, supra, 221 F.3d at p. 932 [inference of agreement permissible where defendant toy manufacturers 
uniformly agreed to retailer's request to limit business with warehouse clubs and evidence showed: (1) defendants' conduct was 
""an abrupt shift from the past;"" (2) defendant' had previously been ""interested in cultivating a relationship with the warehouse 
clubs and increasing sales there,"" and (3) ""manufacturers were unwilling to limit sales to the clubs without assurances that their 
competitors would do likewise""]; City of Long Beach v. Standard Oil Co., supra, 872 F.2d at p. 1406 [inference of agreement 
reasonable where evidence showed defendant oil companies engaged in ""unusual effort"" to maintain an elaborate, 
""cumbersome and inconvenient"" pricing scheme that had no demonstrated advantage over valuing oil using posted prices, 
which was ""inexplicable absent a conspiracy""].) The fifth decision discussed by Plaintiffs, North Texas Specialty Physicians v. 
F.T.C. (5th Cir. 2008) 528 F.3d 346, does not reference  [*64] the doctrine of conscious parallelism or apply any of the factors 
used to evaluate circumstantial evidence of an agreement predicated on uniform conduct. The sixth case involved substantial, 
persuasive circumstantial evidence of collusion that is not present here. (See, e.g., American Column & Lumber Co. v. 
U.S.(1921) 257 U.S. 377, 393-394 [""Open Competition Plan"" administered by trade association involved distribution of member 
""information on [competitor] prices, trade statistics and practices"" and was described as an effort to a ensure ""certain uniformity 
of trade practice,"" ""replace undesirable competition"" with ""co-operative spirit,"" and to organize ""hardwood manufacturers . . . into 
one compact, comprehensive body, equipped to serve the whole trade in a thorough and efficient manner""].) "
1555,15," Plaintiffs' briefs also reference the trial court's ""refusal"" to address claims that HASC had failed to abide by a ""litigation hold"" 
and spoliated evidence. Plaintiffs have not, however, appealed any specific issue related to those spoliation claims and we 
therefore do not address them. "
1556,16," Although Defendants allege that Plaintiffs propounded this request, to our knowledge, the record does not actually include a 
copy of the request. It does, however, contain a filing stating that Defendants did not object to document requests regarding "
1557,," ""who discussed such a plan with other hospitals and with HASC."" In any event, Plaintiffs have not contested Defendants' 
representation that such a request was propounded  [*79] nor do they contest Defendants' assertion that they complied with this 
document request."
1557,17," A memo HASC distributed to its members contains a more thorough list of the changes implemented by AB 60: Many  [*81] employers have been led to believe that AB 60 simply reinstates the daily overtime provisions of state law that 
were repealed by the IWC on January 1, 1998. In reality, AB 60 is much broader and affects many wage-hour practices. 
For example, in addition to reinstating the daily overtime rules, it established four other overtime zones. It does not stop 
there. AB 60 dramatically changes the rules regarding the 'white collar exemptions,' changes the meal period provisions, 
adds a 'make up time' rule, creates a standard regarding commuting time in ridesharing vehicles, modifies the existing 
overtime pay exemption for union employees, creates personal liability, establishes a system for the DLSE to issue citations 
to alleged violators, and does various other things. It also establishes new rules regarding 'alternative workweek schedules' that will preclude shifts exceeding 10 hours at 
straight time and replace the 'flexible work arrangement' provisions that CHA had fought hard to establish almost a decade 
ago. As a practical matter, it will outlaw most of the 12-hour shift arrangements that now exist in the industry. "
1558,18," The record is ambiguous on this point. Simmons is counsel of record for Memorial Health Services (MHS). In June of 2007, 
Plaintiffs filed a form ""Amendment to Complaint"" identifying MHS as ""Doe defendant number 4."" It is unclear whether Plaintiffs 
named MHS in their second or third amended complaints. However, because Plaintiffs have never contended that Simmons is 
not an opposing counsel, we need not address the issue. "
1559,19," The only reference to the record on this point is to document requests seeking CHA-related documents from non-defendant 
hospital members of HASC. "
1564,1," No. 09-5485, orders of 6/08/2010 and 09/17/2010 (granting a motion by all parties to dismiss Monroe). "
1566,2," With no citations to the record or to case law, Stratienko baldly asserts that the district court did not take facts in Stratienko's 
favor when deciding the motions for summary judgment. He has waived the claim by failing to argue the point.  [**9] See 
Buziashvili v. Inman, 106 F.3d 709, 719 (6th Cir. 1997)."
1566,3," Stratienko ""incorporates . . . by reference"" about twenty pages from his district court filings in which he argued for longer 
statutes of limitations. We will not review those arguments. See Northland Ins. Co. v. Stewart Title Guar. Co., 327 F.3d 448, 452-
53 (6th Cir. 2003) (rejecting arguments incorporated by reference from pleadings submitted to lower courts because the practice 
circumvents word limitations and forces the court ""to play archaeologist with the record"") (internal quotation marks omitted). "
1567,4," The district court's prior denial of summary judgment to Erlanger on ostensibly similar legal grounds is irrelevant to our de novo 
review. "
1573,1," In this regard, Goldmark's argument that Catlin has not yet denied the claim, but rather has delayed making a decision on the 
claim, and thereby has breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, is a red herring. First, in so arguing 
Goldmark alleges additional facts not contained in the amended complaint. (Goldmark's Opp'n at 1-3, 8.) These ""facts"" should 
be disregarded in deciding this motion to dismiss. E.g., Kramer v. Time Warner, Inc., 937 F.2d 767, 773 (2d Cir. 1991) (""In 
considering a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), a district court must limit itself to facts 
stated in the complaint or in documents attached to the complaint as exhibits or incorporated in the complaint by reference."") 
Second, and more importantly, by seeking damages equal to the amount due on the claim, Goldmark shows its true intent — it 
wants the theft claim to be paid. If all Goldmark is complaining about is Catlin's improper delay in deciding the claim, then 
 [*11] the relief it should be seeking on its implied covenant claim is to force Catlin to decide the claim promptly, not pay it."
1573,2," I note that Goldmark has not requested leave to replead should any of its claims be dismissed. Accordingly, the claims should 
all be dismissed with prejudice. "
1574,3," This argument was raised for the first time in opposition to the motion to dismiss. Again, in deciding a motion to dismiss under 
Rule 12(b)(6) a court is confined to the pleadings and any exhibits attached or incorporated by reference. E.g., Kramer, 937 F.2d 
at 773. "
1576,4," Goldmark's reliance on Carb v. Lincoln Ben. Life Co., Inc., No. 09 Civ. 2980 (RMB) (KNF), 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87647, 2009 
WL 3049785 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 22, 2009), is misplaced.  [*23] Although the Carb court noted that the facts surrounding the breach 
of contract and declaratory judgment claims ""may be identical and [] both claims may ultimately prove to be coextensive,"" 2009 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87647, [WL] at * 5 (emphasis added), the claims, while similar, were more distinct than those presented here. 
The plaintiff in Carb sought both (1) a declaration of its affirmative rights to convert two life insurance policies from one form to 
another, and (2) money damages for not allowing plaintiff to do so. Here, the relief Goldmark seeks in its two claims is virtually 
identical — payment of the claim and a declaration that defendant must pay the claim. Interestingly, the same district judge that 
authored the decision in Carb also authored the decision in Dolphin Direct Equity Partners, LP v. Interactive Motorsports and 
Entertainment Corp., No. 08 Civ. 1558 (RMB) (THK), 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21938, 2009 WL 577916 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 2, 2009). In 
the latter case, the plaintiff sought damages for the breach of two separate provisions of a contract, as well as a declaration that 
defendants had breached and continued to breach both provisions of the contract. 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21938, 2009 WL 
577916 at *8, 11. The district judge held that the declaratory judgment  [*24] claim was superfluous of the breach of contract 
claim, and dismissed the former. "
1584,1," As noted by the Ninth Circuit in Newcal, antitrust law requires allegations of both a product market and geographic market 513 
F.3d at 1045. The geographic market is not at issue in this matter. Rather the Court must determine whether ""wheel games"" 
create a viable product market. "
1586,2," In addition to the foregoing. Bally filed a Motion to Strike (#1037) seeking to strike arguments raised for the first time in IGT's 
reply brief. That motion is GRANTED. "
1588,3," In its Opposition. IGT offers a covenant not to sue Bally"" ""for patent infringement under the '891 patent arising from activities 
and/or products occurring on or before the date the Federal Circuit summarily affirmed this Court's orders granting summary 
judgment of noninfringement - October 22, 2009"" (Opp. (#1016) at 4). IGT further offers that if the '891 validity  [*26] issue is not 
held to be moot but all other issues are resolved through the current briefing process, which they are. IGT offers Bally a 
""covenant not to sue or the '891 patent for any and all future conduct."" Id. "
1598,1," ""Tertiary care"" refers to highly sophisticated, specialized care. See Highmark Br. at 3 n.1. ""Quaternary care"" refers to 
""advanced levels of medicine which are highly specialized and not widely used."" Id. at 4 n.2."
1598,2," Specifically, the relevant market with respect to Highmark  [**4] is alleged to be the Allegheny County market for ""health care 
financing and administration for private employers and individuals, including indemnity insurance, managed care products such 
as HMO, PPO, or POS plans, and third-party administration of employer self-funded health plans."" JA 129. But in their briefs the 
parties have referred to this market as the Allegheny County market for health insurance, and we do the same. "
1600,3," In fact, United Healthcare tried to enter the Allegheny County insurance market in 2005 and 2006, but it was effectively 
prevented from doing so because UPMC would not offer it a competitive contract."
1600,4," Even so, the loan agreement allowed West Penn to obtain financing elsewhere and to repay the loan early, which West Penn 
did in 2007. See JA 710-11. "
1601,5," For example, from 2002-2006, ""health insurance premiums for single individuals in the Pittsburgh area rose approximately 55% 
and health insurance premiums for Pittsburgh families rose approximately 51%."" JA 105. The increases in nearby regions were 
much lower. "
1603,6," In reaching its decision, the District Court relied heavily on evidence extrinsic to the complaint. HN2[
] The general rule, of 
course, is that ""a district court ruling on a motion to dismiss may not consider matters extraneous to the pleadings."" In re 
Burlington Coat Factory Sec. Litig., 114 F.3d 1410, 1426 (3d Cir. 1997). A limited exception exists for documents that are 
""integral to or explicitly relied upon in the  [**20] complaint."" Id. (emphasis in original and internal quotation marks omitted). No 
purpose would be served by examining each document that the District Court relied on and determining whether it was properly 
considered. But based on an initial review, we believe that the Court may have considered several documents which should not 
have been within its purview. "
1604,7," Commentators have noted that, HN10[
] to the extent it bans conspiracies to monopolize, section 2 is largely superfluous, as conspiracies to monopolize will usually—if not always—run afoul of section 1's prohibition of conspiracies that unreasonably 
 [**25] restrain trade. See, e.g., Mark T.L. Sargent, Economics Upside-Down: Low-Price Guarantees as Mechanisms for 
Facilitating Tacit Collusion, 141 U. Pa. L. Rev. 2055, 2109 (1993). Even so, the fact that Congress created a redundant cause of 
action is not a basis for dismissal. See JTC Petroleum Co. v. Piasa Motor Fuels, Inc., 190 F.3d 775, 779-80 (7th Cir. 1999). "
1605,8," Because we conclude that the allegations of direct evidence are by themselves sufficient, we do not address the sufficiency of 
the circumstantial allegations. See Ins. Brokerage, 618 F.3d at 323."
1605,9, The defendants do not challenge West Penn's definition of the relevant markets.
1605,10," In so concluding, we do not reach West Penn's argument that—given the horizontal aspect of the conspiracy, i.e., UPMC's 
agreement to shrink UPMC Health Plan—the conspiracy is subject to per se condemnation. Even if the more demanding rule of 
reason applies, the complaint adequately alleges that the conspiracy stifled competition in the relevant markets. "
1607,11," Although this case is considered on a motion to dismiss, the loan agreement may be reviewed because it is integral to the 
complaint. Burlington Coat, 114 F.3d at 1426."
1607,12," Indeed, the complaint alleges that the only other insurer with a significant market share is UPMC Health Plan, and that UPMC 
Health Plan has basically been unwilling to deal with West Penn. "
1609,13," HN21[
] Although Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(c) suggests that ""a statute of limitations defense cannot be used in the context of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss,"" Oshiver v. Levin, Fishbein, Sedran & Berman, 38 F.3d 1380, 1384 n.1 (3d Cir. 
1994), our cases recognize that a defendant may raise a limitations defense in a motion to dismiss, Robinson v. Johnson, 313 
F.3d 128, 135 & n.3 (3d Cir. 2002) (citing cases). For the defendant to prevail, though, the plaintiff's tardiness in bringing the 
action must be apparent from the face of the complaint. Id. "
1611,14," We previously recognized—though perhaps in overly broad terms—that HN29[
] making false statements about a rival, 
without more, rarely interferes with competition enough to violate the antitrust laws. See Santana Prods., Inc. v. Bobrick 
Washroom Equip., Inc., 401 F.3d 123, 132 (3d Cir. 2005)  [**54] (stating, in the context of a section 1 case, that ""'deception, 
reprehensible as it is, can be of no consequence so far as the Sherman Act is concerned'""). But in some cases, such 
defamation, which plainly is not competition on the merits, can give rise to antitrust liability, especially when it is combined with 
other anticompetitive acts. See Lepage's, 324 F.3d at 153, 162; Int'l Travel, 623 F.2d at 1268, 1270; Caribbean, 148 F.3d at 
1087. "
1612,15," UPMC argues that we may not consider hirings made outside the limitations period in determining whether the new hirings 
 [**56] were anticompetitive. Not so. Toledo Mack, 530 F.3d at 217 (holding that HN31[
] it is proper to consider pre-limitations 
period conduct in determining whether conduct within the limitations period violated the antitrust laws)."
1612,16," West Penn also claims that UPMC's acquisition of Mercy Hospital was anticompetitive. It says that, besides West Penn, Mercy 
was UPMC's only other competitor in the market for specialized hospital services, and that the acquisition brought UPMC one 
step closer to monopoly. As UPMC points out, however, West Penn has failed to allege that it sustained an antitrust injury as a 
result of the acquisition, and thus may not challenge it. See Alberta Gas, 826 F.2d at 1241-42 (gas producer sustained no 
antitrust injury as a result of an acquisition of a potential competitor by another competitor); Areeda & Hovenkamp, supra, ¶ 
348b, at 204. "
1653,1," TMC is a Japanese corporation and is the parent corporation of TMS, which handles sales and marketing in the United States. 
(MCC ¶¶ 76-77.) The MCC makes allegations as to Defendants collectively, and at times individually. The Court makes such 
distinctions only when material to the issues presented in the instant motions."
1653,2," Claims by a putative class of foreign Plaintiffs are asserted in a separate consolidated complaint. See Court's Sept. 13, 2010, 
Order at 3-4 (Docket No. 341) (appointing Monica R. Kelly as lead counsel for the foreign economic loss Plaintiffs and ordering 
the filing of a consolidated complaint on behalf of the foreign Plaintiffs); Amended Foreign Economic Loss Master Consolidated 
Complaint (Docket No. 449)."
1653,3," In addition to the putative class of individuals, a small number of business entities — such as an auto dealership and a car 
rental business — are Plaintiffs as well. (MCC ¶¶ 71-74.) "
1654,4," As it must, for purposes of the present Motion to Dismiss, the Court accepts as true the factual allegations set forth by Plaintiffs 
in the MCC. The Court notes that, in some instances, Plaintiffs have referred to specific documents in support of their factual 
allegations. These documents are not appended to the MCC and have not been filed with the Court. As a result, these 
documents have not been examined by the Court, and the Court expresses no opinion regarding whether they support the 
allegations made in the MCC."
1654,5," All paragraph references are to the MCC, unless otherwise noted. "
1657,6," Plaintiffs allege that internal Toyota documents reveal that Defendants knew of the need for a brake-override system as early 
as 2007. (¶¶ 19, 249.)"
1657,7," The Nevada corporation is alleged to have its ""nerve center"" and ""principal place of business"" in California. (¶ 74). "
1658,8," Toyota argues in passing that ""[a]dditionally, Plaintiffs cannot satisfy the causal connection requirement for standing because 
they have not alleged an actual injury which was caused by Toyota's conduct."" (Defs.' Mem. at 9.) As is evident in the 
subsequent subheadings, (see Defs.' Mem. at 10, 13), Toyota does not develop this alternative argument in its Motion — or, at a 
minimum, clearly differentiate it from its""injury in fact"" arguments. Therefore, the Court does not address it."
1658,9," The Court recognizes that  [**105] the injury-in-fact requirement can sometimes be satisfied by a credible threat of future harm. 
See, e.g., Pisciotta v. Old Nat'l Bancorp, 499 F.3d 629, 634 (7th Cir. 2007) (holding that ""the injury-in-fact requirement can be 
satisfied by a threat of future harm or by an act which harms the plaintiff only by increasing the risk of future harm that the 
plaintiff would have otherwise faced, absent the defendant's actions.""); Baur v. Veneman, 352 F.3d 625, 633 (2d Cir. 2003) 
(stating that ""courts of appeals have generally recognized that threatened harm in the form of an increased risk of future injury 
may serve as injury-in-fact for Article III standing purposes.""); Cent. Delta Water Agency v. United States, 306 F.3d 938, 947-48 
(9th Cir. 2002) (holding that ""a credible threat of harm is sufficient to constitute actual injury for standing purposes,"" especially 
environmental harms, because ""monetary compensation may well not adequately return plaintiffs to their original position.""). 
Thus, it is at least conceivable that a credible threat of a manifested SUA defect might be sufficient, in and of itself, to confer 
standing — which would be consistent with Plaintiffs' ""ticking time bomb""  [**106] argument. (See Pltfs.' Opp'n at 9.) However, 
Plaintiffs do not pursue standing on this basis, and therefore the Court does not entertain the possibility further. "
1659,10," Plaintiffs also allege that the commercial Plaintiffs ""overpaid for the vehicles"" and ""suffered lost profits and other economic 
losses due to [their] inability to sell the Toyota vehicles."" (¶¶ 71-74.)"
1659,11," This reasoning would hold true at the time of purchase, Kearney v. Hyundai Motor Co., SACV 09-1298 DOC (MLGx), 2010 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 68242, at *12, 14 (C.D. Cal. June 4, 2010) (adopting Cole's logic and explaining that the ""alleged defects 
reduced the car's value and deprived the consumer of the benefit of the bargain, even when the alleged defects did not later 
materialize — i.e., the loss was suffered 'at the moment' of purchase."") (emphasis in the original), or, as plaintiffs allege, at the 
time that the SUA defect became known to the public. (¶ 70). "
1660,12," In other words, these cases were decided under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), or the analogous state rule, for failure to state a 
claim. "
1663,13," HN7[
] While  [**124] ""only one of the named Plaintiffs is required to establish standing in order to seek relief on behalf of the 
entire class,"" Central States Southeast and Southwest Areas Health and Welfare Fund v. Merck-Medco Managed Care, LLC, 
504 F.3d 229, 241 (2d Cir. 2007), that means that a class action can proceed as long as one of the lead plaintiffs has standing. It 
does not obviate the need for other lead plaintiffs, seeking to proceed as such, to establish standing."
1663,14," But see Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343, 357, 116 S. Ct. 2174, 135 L. Ed. 2d 606 (1996) (stating in dicta that ""general 
allegations of the complaint in the present case may well have sufficed to claim injury by named plaintiffs, and hence standing to 
demand remediation, with respect to various alleged inadequacies in the prison system, including failure to provide adequate 
legal assistance to non-English-speaking inmates and lockdown prisoners,"" but stating that ""[this] point is irrelevant now, 
however, for we are beyond the pleading stage."")."
1663,15," Because the Court has concluded that at least some Plaintiffs have standing, the Court, throughout this Order, discusses 
whether those Plaintiffs have asserted claims upon which relief can be granted. Cf. Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better "
1664,," Environment, 523 U.S. 83, 94, 118 S. Ct. 1003, 140 L. Ed. 2d 210 (1998) (rejecting a court's practice of ""assuming"" jurisdiction 
for the purpose of deciding the merits)."
1664,16," Toyota also contends that Plaintiffs do not plead actual reliance to satisfy the standing requirements. (Defs.' Mem. at 17-19.) 
Because the Court grants in part Toyota's Motion on other grounds, the Court does not reach this issue. The Court notes that the 
AMCC makes significant changes to the named Plaintiffs' allegations with respect to actual reliance, which may moot Toyota's 
concerns. For these same reasons, the Court does not reach Toyota's argument that Plaintiffs lack standing under the CLRA 
because Plaintiffs cannot show actual causation and reliance. (Defs.' Mem. at 19-20.) "
1665,17," Plaintiffs argue merely in passing that their claims do not sound in fraud. They argue they have not alleged a fraudulent course 
of conduct because Toyota ""negligently designed, manufactured, sold and/or marketed the Defective Vehicles"" and ""Toyota 
should have monitored NHTSA's consumer safety database for indications of changing patterns in the complaints by model with 
ETCS."" (Pltfs.' Opp'n Brief at 25, citing to ¶¶ 123, 245.) The Court acknowledges that fraud is not a necessary element of a UCL or a CLRA claim. Vess v. Ciba-Geigy Corp., 317 F. 3d 
1097, 1103 (9th Cir. 2003); see also Shin v. BMW of North America, No. 09-00398, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 67994, 2009 WL 
2163509, at *11 (C.D. Cal. July 16, 2009) (finding that ""plaintiffs are not required to plead 'reliance' and 'materiality' with 
particularity because those elements are distinct from the common law fraud element of 'justifiable reliance.'""). However, when a 
plaintiff alleges fraudulent conduct and relies on that conduct  [**133] as the basis of a claim, the claim is ""grounded in fraud."" 
Vess, 317 F. 3d at 1103-04. Plaintiffs allege that Toyota represented that its cars were safe when in fact they allegedly contain a 
defect known to Toyota that causes SUA. Therefore, fraud is an essential element of the claims at issue here, and Plaintiffs must 
plead under Rule 9(b). "
1666,18," The Court notes that none of the Plaintiffs appear to allege that they relied on specific advertising by Toyota in purchasing or 
leasing their cars. Instead, Plaintiffs allege generally  [**138] that ""in purchasing or leasing their vehicles, the Plaintiffs relied on 
the misrepresentations and/or omissions of Toyota with respect of the safety and reliability of the vehicles."" (¶ 327.) In its brief, 
Toyota focuses on the lack of an alleged defect, and does not appear to argue that a 9(b) issue exists as to whether Plaintiffs 
relied on Toyota's representations. Allegations of representations from product labels and statements that, had consumers not 
been deceived by the labels, they would not have purchased the product, are sufficient to plead under Rule 9(b). Von Koenig, "
1667,713," F. Supp. 2d at 1077-78. The Court expresses no opinion about the reliance issue as it pertains to Rule 9(b) and believes 
that Plaintiffs may have provided more specificity in their First Amended Master Consolidated Complaint. "
1668,19," Toyota has requested this Court strike Plaintiffs' request for actual and statutory damages and punitive damages pursuant to 
the CLRA violation. (Defs.' Mot. to Strike at 1 (citing¶¶ 310-12).) "
1670,20," Toyota also cites to Cirulli v. Hyundai Motor Co., No. 08-0854, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 125139, 2009 WL 5788762, *3 (C.D. 
Cal. June 12, 2009), for the proposition that safety representations are not always actionable. (Defs.' Reply at 9.) In that case, 
the court analyzed statements in the context of a fraudulent misrepresentation claim, and granted the motion to dismiss the FAL 
claim because no opposition was filed. Cirulli, supra, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 125139, [WL] at *3, *5. The Court finds this case is 
not instructive as to the present FAL claim. "
1673,21," Hampton was decided under the provision of the Uniform Sales Act that parallels the Uniform Commercial Code§ 2-607(3)(a). 
The substance of the two provisions are indistinguishable. Compare Cal. Civ. Code § 1769 (repealed 1963) (""In the absence of 
express or implied agreement of the parties, acceptance of the goods by the buyer shall not discharge the seller from liability in 
damages or other legal remedy for breach of any promise or warranty in the contract to sell or the sale. But, if, after acceptance 
of the goods, the buyer fails to give notice to the seller of the breach of any promise or warranty within a reasonable time after 
the buyer knows, or ought to know of such breach, the seller  [**163] shall not be liable therefor."") with Cal. Com. Code § 
2607(3)(A) (""The buyer must, within a reasonable time after he or she discovers or should have discovered any breach, notify 
the seller of breach or be barred from any remedy . . . .""). "
1675,22," Note, however, that Plaintiffs are not required to allege reliance. See e.g., Weinstat v. Dentsply Intern., Inc., 180 Cal. App. 4th 
1213, 1227, 103 Cal. Rptr. 3d 614 (2010) (""Pre-Uniform Commercial Code law governing express warranties required the "
1676,," purchaser to prove reliance on specific promises made by the seller. . . . The Uniform Commercial Code, however, does not 
require such proof."") (internal citations omitted)."
1676,23," Plaintiffs also point out  [**173] that two non-consumer Plaintiffs allege that they purchased vehicles directly from Toyota. ¶¶ 
71-72, 74. To the extent any Plaintiff alleges he or she purchased vehicles directly from any Defendant, privity of contract is 
obviously established. However, not all the allegations to which Plaintiffs point sufficiently allege such purchases. (Compare ¶ 71 
(""Green Spot Motors purchased a 2009 Camry from Toyota."") with ¶ 72 (using an ambiguous term, ""direct purchases"") and ¶ 74 
(using the ambiguous term, ""direct dealing . . . with the [d]efendants,"" coupled with the legal conclusion, ""so that [Plaintiff] is in 
privity with those [d]efendants"").) "
1680,24, It is for this reason that the Court's dismissal of the revocation claim is without prejudice. 
1682,25," Plaintiffs also allege that the potential for SUA constitutes  [**195] a safety hazard. The risk of injury and/or death associated 
with the alleged SUA defect is the type of ""unreasonable risk"" that leads to a duty to disclose under California law. Daugherty, 
144 Cal. App. 4th at 836. See also Falk, 496 F. Supp. 2d at 1096 (citing as further strength of plaintiffs' defect allegations ""the 
[alleged] risk of inadvertent speeding, driving at unsafe speeds, and accidents""). "
1683,26," Although Toyota discounts Plaintiffs' allegations of an SUA defect, ""[t]he amassed weight of these complaints suggests that 
plaintiffs' [unexplained SUA events] were not isolated cases. Instead, when viewed in the light most favorably  [**198] to the 
plaintiffs, these collected complaints [may] suggest strongly that there was a defect . . . ."" Falk, 496 F. Supp. 2d at 1096. "
1684,27," For example, Plaintiffs cite Snowney v. Harrah's Entm't, Inc., 35 Cal. 4th 1054, 29 Cal. Rptr. 3d 33, 112 P.3d 28 (2005), in 
support of their assertion  [**202] that ""the California Supreme Court has permitted concurrent contract and unjust enrichment 
claims."" (Pltfs.' Opp'n Brief at 51.) In Snowey, however, the California Supreme Court addressed whether the defendants were 
subject to personal jurisdiction, not whether unjust enrichment was a cognizable claim. See id. at 1061-70. Although the 
Supreme Court did not dismiss the plaintiffs' claim for unjust enrichment, the issue presented to the court was purely 
jurisdictional: the viability of the plaintiffs' unjust enrichment claim was not at issue. Thus, neither this case nor any other case 
cited by Plaintiffs persuades the Court to adopt the minority view that unjust enrichment is an independent claim under California 
law. "
1685,28," Additionally, the Court notes that the Plaintiffs have alleged a claim for restitution. Thus, a claim for unjust enrichment ""would 
not enlarge the range of remedies Plaintiffs may otherwise seek."" Marsikian, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 117012, at *21 (citing 
Baggett, 582 F. Supp. 2d at 1270-71 and Falk, 496 F. Supp. 2d at 1099). "
1686,29," In any event, the Court finds that field preemption is not present. ""The plain language of 49 U.S.C. § 30103(b)(1) indicates . . . 
that Congress intended to leave open to consumers State remedies in addition to the administrative petition process. Even if the 
relevant field were recalls, because this savings clause also makes particular reference to notification and recall provisions as 
non-exclusive remedies, [an] argument that State law in this area is field-preempted [would] run[] contrary to the  [**208] plain 
language of the statute."" Chamberlan, 314 F. Supp. 2d at 959-60. In addition to the plain language of the Safety Act, case law 
and legislative history ""support the conclusion that Congress did not intend to supplant all State regulation of motor vehicle 
safety."" Id. at 961. Thus, Plaintiffs' request for injunctive relief is not field-preempted by the Safety Act. "
1687,30," As explained in the next paragraph, the Court notes that the proper inquiry is not whether a conflict exists between the relief 
sought and the Safety Act. Rather, the proper inquiry is whether a conflict exists between a State law or a claim asserted 
thereunder and the Safety Act. Nonetheless, because Toyota's motion on this issue focuses on the request for injunctive relief 
contained in paragraph (i) of the Prayer for Relief of the MCC and because that request is grounded in other claims asserted in 
the MCC, the Court's analysis likewise addresses why the request for relief does not actually conflict with the Safety Act."
1687,31," ""Were there no presumption against preemption in this case, Defendant would still need to demonstrate 'clear evidence of 
conflict' to support  [**213] its theory that State law is preempted."" Id. (quoting Geier, 529 U.S. at 885.) Even under such a 
standard, Toyota's failure to demonstrate an actual conflict between Plaintiffs' requested relief and the Safety Act would be fatal 
to its preemption argument."
1687,32," In Kent, the Plaintiffs had requested ""that the Court create a fund available  [**215] to remedy the park-to-reverse defect and 
to order Defendant to bear the cost of notice to Class Members."" Id. at 1217, n.3 (internal quotations omitted). Plaintiffs in that 
case did not seek a court-ordered recall. However, this distinction between Kent and the instant case does not detract from the 
soundness of the Kent court's reasoning that Congress did not manifest an intent to split remedies when determining if conflict 
preemption applies. "
1688,33," While Congress also intended to promote uniformity, uniformity is merely a secondary objective of the Safety Act. See Tofany, 
419 F.2d at 511; Buzzard v. Roadrunner Trucking, Inc., 966 F.2d 777, 783-84 (3d Cir. 1992); Chamberlan, 314 F. Supp. 2d at 
962-63. Thus, even if Toyota were to argue that Plaintiffs' requested relief would undermine the uniformity Congress sought to 
promote in passing the Safety Act, ""some negative effect on uniformity"" is not sufficient to trigger preemption of State law under 
the Safety Act. Buzzard, 966 F.2d at 783-84."
1688,34," Toyota also points out that Plaintiffs have not cited ""a single case granting a nationwide court-ordered vehicle recall."" (Reply at 
20, emphasis omitted.) At this stage, however, the Court is presented with the question of whether the request for relief must be 
eliminated from Plaintiffs' MCC, not whether, in the event that Plaintiffs succeed on their claims, a nationwide court-ordered 
recall is an appropriate remedy. Thus, Toyota's argument that no court has ultimately ordered a nationwide vehicle recall does 
not persuade the Court that the reasoning in Chamberlan, Kent, and Marsikian is any less persuasive in determining whether 
conflict preemption requires the Court to dismiss Plaintiffs' claims or strike Plaintiffs' requested remedy at the pleading stage. "
1689,35," If Toyota's distinction between state-wide and nation-wide recalls was correct, it would be difficult to see how a recall in 
California — where more than ten percent of the nation resides and likely more than ten percent of the nation's vehicles are 
maintained — would not also be disruptive of the Safety  [**220] Act. See Chamberlan, 314 F. Supp. 2d at 964-65."
1689,36," The Court notes that the classic primary jurisdiction situation is one in which the plaintiffs' claims are predicated on imposing 
civil liability under a regulatory statute. See, e.g., W. Pac. R.R., 352 U.S. at 62-70 (giving ""first pass on the construction of the 
tariff in dispute"" and ""the reasonableness of the  [**222] tariff as applied"" to the Interstate Commerce Commission). In such 
situations, the expertise of the regulatory body is particularly helpful in determining whether the regulatory statute itself provides 
proper grounds for a claim for civil liability. In this case, on the other hand, Plaintiffs' claims are not predicated on the Safety Act. "

1697,1," The mattress industry in the United States produces and sells two types of mattresses: traditional innerspring mattresses and 
non-traditional mattresses, which includes visco-elastic foam mattresses such as those manufactured by TPX. The mattress 
industry has annual sales of $4 billion, $800 million of which consists of non-traditional mattresses. "

1698,4," Jacobs seeks the same relief against TPX's parent corporation, Tempur-Pedic International, Inc. Although Jacobs's complaint 
does not allege that the parent corporation and TPX are one and the same under an alter ego or other theory of liability, for 
purposes of this opinion we treat the two corporations as one entity: TPX. The relevant treble damages provision reads: HN2[

may sue therefor in any district court of the United States in the district in which the defendant resides  [**4] or is found or

including sections 13, 14, 18, and 19 of this title, when and under the same conditions and principles as injunctive relief 
against threatened conduct that will cause loss or damage is granted by courts of equity, under the rules governing such 
proceedings, and upon the execution of proper bond against damages for an injunction improvidently granted and a 
showing that the danger of irreparable loss or damage is immediate, a preliminary injunction may issue[.]"

1699,8," The Court further described rule of reason analysis in this manner: ""The true test of legality is whether the restraint imposed is such as merely regulates and perhaps thereby promotes 
competition or whether it is such as may suppress or even destroy  [**9] competition. To determine that question the court 
must ordinarily consider the facts peculiar to the business to which the restraint is applied; its condition before and after the 
restraint was imposed; the nature of the restraint and its effect, actual or probable."" "

1700,9," The most glaring flaw in Dr. Miles's reasoning was its importation of restraints on alienation—a concept traditionally employed 
in the common  [**11] law of property—to justify prohibiting manufacturers from imposing price minimums on downstream 
resellers. The Court's approach reflected ""the formalism of the period"" by applying ""a common law standard with little obvious 
relevance to manufactured goods."" William H. Page, Legal Realism and the Shaping of Modern Antitrust, 44 Emory L.J. 1,16

(""The factual assumptions and common law rule against restraints on alienation that underlied [sic] the Court's condemnation of 
resale price maintenance, however, probably made no sense in 1911 and surely [are] inconsistent with modern antitrust 
jurisprudence which is based primarily on market impact and economic effect.""); Sylvania, 433 U.S. at 53 n.21, 97 S. Ct. at 2559 
n.21 (noting that most commentators regarded past Court reliance on the restraints-on-alienation rule in antitrust cases as ""both 
a misreading of legal history and a perversion of antitrust analysis""). More importantly, the Dr. Miles Court lacked the benefit of the modern consensus in economic literature that vertical resale price 
maintenance may have  [**12] procompetitive effects in many circumstances. It did not consider, for example, that such 
agreements may stimulate interbrand competition by eliminating ""free-riding"" by discounting distributors and by reducing 
intrabrand competition based solely on services provided by retailers. Indeed, ""[b]y the late 1970s, the Supreme Court itself 
recognized at least the possibility that such restraints may serve manufacturer interests in a procompetitive way."" 8 Phillip E.

several of these procompetitive justifications in shifting vertical resale price minimums to rule of reason analysis. "
1701,10," The Court fleshed out the free-rider concept by explaining that [i]f the consumer can[, after learning about a product from an upscale retailer,] buy the product from a retailer that discounts

to the discounter, forcing it to cut back its services to a level lower than consumers would otherwise prefer. Minimum resale 
price maintenance alleviates the problem because it prevents the discounter from undercutting the service provider. With 
price competition decreased, the manufacturer's retailers compete among themselves over services."
1701,551," U.S. at 891, 127 S. Ct. at 2716. "
1702,11," Jacobs's geographic market allegation consists of a one-line statement that ""[t]he relevant geographic market is the United 
States."" While this general allegation seems ambiguous without more information, see Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, 370 
U.S. 294, 337, 82 S. Ct. 1502, 1530, 8 L. Ed. 2d 510 (1962) (""[A]lthough the geographic market in some instances may 
encompass the entire Nation, under other circumstances it may be as small as a single metropolitan area.""), we need not decide 
whether it is sufficient in this particular case. Jacobs cannot prevail because he has not adequately pled the relevant product 
market."
1702,12," Some have criticized Brown Shoe's language of ""submarkets"" and ""practical indicia."" See, e.g., 4 Areeda ¶ 913a, at 62 (""One 
alternative that we do not recommend is a return to Brown Shoe's language of 'submarkets.'""); Fed. Trade Comm'n v. Whole 
Foods Mkt., Inc., 548 F.3d 1028, 1058-59, 1061, 383 U.S. App. D.C. 341 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting) (citing 
Robert H. Bork, The Antitrust Paradox 210, 216 (1978)) (casting doubt on the ""practical indicia"" language and calling the 
practical indicia test ""moribund""), amending 533 F.3d 869, 382 U.S. App. D.C. 397 (D.C. Cir. 2008). We do not enter this debate, 
as we find that even if Brown Shoe's practical indicia are worthy of dispositive weight as a general matter, Jacobs has not 
provided allegations  [**21] sufficient to establish a relevant submarket for visco-elastic foam mattresses."
1702,13," The cross-elasticity of demand measures the change in the quantity demanded by consumers of one product relative to the 
change in price of another. A high cross-elasticity of demand (that is, consumers demanding proportionately greater quantities of 
Product X in response to a relatively minor price increase in Product Y) indicates that the two products are close substitutes for 
each other—that is, consumers derive comparable utility from equivalent consumption of either one. For purposes of the relevant 
product market analysis, a high cross-elasticity of demand indicates that the two products in question are reasonably 
interchangeable substitutes for each other and hence are part of the same market. See Cellophane, 351 U.S. at 400, 76 S. Ct. at 
1010. "
1704,14, Recall from the discussion supra that horizontal price fixing is one of the few per se illegal practices under the Sherman Act. 
1705,15," This court has not adopted a per se rule for such classification; instead, we examine the circumstances of each dual 
distribution arrangement to see whether it more closely resembles a horizontal or vertical agreement. Some cases have 
classified dual distribution relationships as horizontal in character. See, e.g., United States v. McKesson & Robbins, 351 U.S. 
305, 313, 76 S. Ct. 937, 942, 100 L. Ed. 1209 (1956); Hobart Bros. Co. v. Malcolm T. Gilliland, Inc., 471 F.2d 894, 899 (5th Cir. 
1973). The recent trend, however, while it does not illustrate a bright-line rule, has been ""to view the primary relationship 
between a dual distributor and an independent franchisee as vertical where the restrictions do not lessen interbrand competition 
or decrease the availability of goods  [**31] or services."" Midwestern Waffles, Inc. v. Waffle House, Inc., 734 F.2d 705, 720 (11th 
Cir. 1984) (per curiam); see, e.g., Graphic Prods., 717 F.2d at 1576; Abadir & Co. v. First Miss. Corp., 651 F.2d 422, 427-28 (5th 
Cir. Unit A 1981); Red Diamond Supply v. Liquid Carbonic Corp., 637 F.2d 1001, 1005-07 (5th Cir. Unit A 1981); H & B Equip. 
Co. v. Int'l Harvester Co., 577 F.2d 239, 245 (5th Cir. 1978); Hesco Parts, LLC v. Ford Motor Co., No. 3:02CV-736-S, 2006 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 69011, 2006 WL 2734429, at *4-5 (W.D. Ky. Sept. 22, 2006). Professor Areeda also notes that most recent cases 
have classified dual distributorships as vertical relationships subject to the rule of reason. 8 Areeda ¶ 1605b, at 70-71."
1705,16," The agreement would have to be tacit because the complaint makes no allegation of a direct agreement to fix prices. That is, 
the agreement would have taken the form of conscious parallelism. Yet even consciously parallel behavior by firms with similar 
economic interests in a concentrated market is not,  [**33] by itself, unlawful; without more, parallel behavior could be ""just as 
much in line with a wide swath of rational and competitive business strategy unilaterally prompted by common perceptions of the 
market."" Twombly, 550 U.S. at 553-54, 127 S. Ct. at 1964."
1705,17," Conversely, the same holds true for TPX: it would lose market share as a distributor  [**34] by raising prices on its website 
above those charged by distributors, as long as customers' transaction costs incurred in purchasing a Tempur-Pedic mattress 
from a distributor's showroom were lower than the difference between the website price and the distributor's price. "
1707,18," The version of Rule 59(e) in effect when Jacobs filed his motions on December 21, 2007, provided: HN18[

(amended 2009)."
1707,19," The version of Rule 15(a) in effect at the time of Jacobs's motion provided, in relevant part: HN19[
] (a) Amendments Before Trial. (1) Amending as a Matter of Course. A party may amend its pleading  [**39] once as a matter of course: (A) before being served with a responsive pleading; or (B) within 20 days after serving the pleading if a responsive pleading is not allowed and the action is not yet on the trial 
calendar. (2) Other Amendments. In all other cases, a party may amend its pleading only with the opposing party's written consent or 
the court's leave. The court should freely give leave when justice so requires. Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a) (2007) (amended 2009)."
1707,20," HN20[
] A district court's ""decision to alter or amend judgment is committed to the sound discretion of the district judge and 
will not be overturned on appeal absent an abuse of discretion."" Lawson v. Singletary, 85 F.3d 502, 507 (11th Cir. 1996) (per 
curiam) (quoting Am. Home Assurance Co. v. Glenn Estess & Assocs., Inc., 763 F.2d 1237, 1238-39 (11th Cir. 1985)). HN21[

A district court's denial of a motion for leave to amend is reviewed under the same abuse of discretion standard. See Laurie v. 
Ala. Court of Criminal Appeals, 256 F.3d 1266, 1269 (11th Cir. 2001). "
1709,1," Many state courts predicated their pleading requirements on the now-overruled Conley standard. It remains to be seen if and 
how these states will alter their pleading requirements in light of Twombly. "
1715,1," His company, Buck's Fishery LLC, is also nominally an appellant. For purposes of this decision, we shall refer to Edward Szuch

Order (Dkt. No. 76). When the Court is referring specifically to either of the motions filed by the individual Defendants Weaver 
and Booth, the Court will indicate ""Weaver Mot."" or ""Booth Mot."" "
1734,2," As this Court did in its recent Opinion and Order Denying Direct Purchaser Defendants' Motion to Dismiss in the related 
antitrust multidistrict litigation, In re Packaged Ice Antitrust Litig., 723 F. Supp. 2d 987, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 65549, 2010 WL 
2671306 at * 22 n. 2 (E.D. Mich. July 1, 2010), the Court takes judicial notice of, and at times refers to, allegations made in the 
complaints filed in this Court in the antitrust case and in the related whistleblower action filed against Reddy Ice by Martin 
McNulty, McNulty v. Reddy Ice Holdings, Inc., No. 08-13178. See Hinds County v. Wachovia Bank N.A., 700 F. Supp. 2d 378, 
395-96 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (court in lead action in multidistrict antitrust litigation taking judicial notice of first amended complaint 
filed in a related action, recognizing  [**15] the court's inherent power to rely on matters of public record in deciding a motion to

(2d Cir.2000)). See also Rodic v. Thistledown Racing Club, Inc., 615 F.2d 736, 738 (6th Cir.1980) (taking judicial notice of the

1741,3," Helwig was overruled on a different point by Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues and Rights, Ltd., 551 U.S. 308, 127 S. Ct. 2499, 168 
L. Ed. 2d 179 (2007), which held that the competing inference necessary to establish scienter need only be at least as 
compelling as any opposing inference and not, as was held in Helwig, the most plausible competing inference. See Frank v. 
Dana Corp., 547 F.3d 564, 571 (6th Cir. 2008) (recognizing that Helwig was overruled in part on this ground by Tellabs). Helwig 
remains good law in the Sixth Circuit, however, on several other important points of law. See, e.g. Konkol v. Diebold, 590 F.3d 
390, 399 (6th Cir. 2009)  [**42] (applying the nine factors identified in Helwig as relevant to a determination of scienter). See 
infra discussion at section IIIC. "
1742,4," Defendants claim that ""the cornerstone of Plaintiffs' claims appears to be the 'written covenant not to compete' that Reddy 
entered into with Mountain Water Ice in 2001."" (Defs.' Mot. 2.) Plaintiffs respond that this self-serving characterization of 
Plaintiffs' claims is completely without merit, that the CCAC ""is not predicated on any 2001 sales transaction,"" which contained a 
covenant not to compete between Arctic Glacier and Reddy Ice's predecessor, was limited to a specific area in California and 
""expired years before the FBI raided Reddy Ice's headquarters and Ben Key was terminated."" (Pls.' Resp. 8 n. 7; 14-15 n. 13.) In 
fact, this Court has already ruled that the 2001 agreement was not specifically referenced in Plaintiffs' CCAC and is not properly "
1743,," before the Court on this motion to dismiss on the pleadings. (See Opinion and Order Affirming The Magistrate Judge's February 
18, 2010 Order Granting Plaintiffs' Motion  [**48] To Strike (Dkt. No. 76)). Plaintiffs state that the ""foundation of the Complaint 
[are]the undisclosed illegal market allocation agreements between and among Reddy Ice, Arctic Glacier and Home City that 
[were] ongoing throughout the Class Period."" (Pls.' Resp. 8 n. 7.) Indeed the CCAC claims the existence of agreements which 
go beyond any alleged 2001 transaction with an attendant covenant not to compete. The alleged agreements referred to in the 
CCAC, based on the first-hand knowledge of McNulty and the corroborating testimony of confidential witnesses as well as the 
related government investigations and guilty pleas of Reddy Ice's alleged co-conspirators, are nationwide in scope and involve 
agreements to allocate entire states and regions for the express purpose of ""driving up prices,"" which are alleged to have been 
ongoing throughout the class period. At this pleading stage, the Court does not inquire whether these allegations are true but 
simply whether they are supported by sufficient factual content and whether, if true, they suffice to state a claim. The issues 
presented by Defendants' preferred narrow reading of the CCAC are not properly resolved on a 12(b)(6) motion. City of Monroe, 
399 F.3d at 672-673. "
1746,5," Defendants allege, in an argument that this Court previously declined to consider because it presented matters outside the 
pleadings, that Reddy Ice disclosed the ""covenant not to compete"" in multiple public filings and argue that therefore any 
misrepresentations about this fact, which was already known to the investing public, are not actionable. See City of Monroe, 399 
F.3d at 675. However, as the court noted in City of Monroe, ""in an open and efficient market 'information important to a 
reasonable investor is immediately incorporated into stock prices.'"" Id. at 676 (quoting In re Burlington Coat Factory Sec. Litig., 
114 F.3d 1410, 1425 (3d Cir. 1997)). It was not until after disclosures beginning on March 5, 2008 with the execution of the 
search warrant on Reddy Ice that Reddy Ice stock prices began to reflect the information being disseminated. This drop in share 
price so closely related in time to the emergence of the investigations into alleged market allocation agreements and the 
subsequent suspension of Ben Key would lead a reasonable  [**63] juror to conclude that the market had not previously 
received the true facts related to competition in the packaged ice industry. See City of Monroe, 399 F.3d at 676. "
1750,6," The Court also infers scienter from Brick and Janusek's Sarbanes-Oxley (""SOX"") certifications, which state in part that, based 
on their knowledge, the Form 10-Q report does not contain any material misrepresentations or omit any material fact otherwise 
necessary to make the other disclosures not misleading. (CCAC ¶ 76.) An inference of scienter from these certifications is 
appropriate where, as here, ""the complaint asserts facts indicating that, at the time of certification, defendants knew or 
consciously avoided any meaningful  [**79] exposure to the information that was rendering their SOX certification erroneous."" In 
re Intelligroup, 527 F. Supp. 2d at 290. See also Grillo v. Tempur-Pedic Int'l, Inc., 553 F. Supp. 2d 809, 819 (E.D. Ky. 2008) 
(finding that SOX certifications are only probative of scienter if the person signing was seriously reckless in certifying the truth 
and fairness of the financial statements)."
1750,7," The Court acknowledges that generally a company's ""code of ethics,"" which is ""essentially mandatory"" under SEC regulations, 
is thought to be ""inherently aspirational"" and unable, standing alone, to support an inference of scienter. Andropolis v. Red Robin 
Gourmet Burgers, Inc., 505 F. Supp. 2d 662, 685-686 (D. Colo. 2007). However, the Reddy Ice Ethics Code, which Brick attests 
to having ""carefully studied,"" specifically acknowledges the inherent illegality of market division agreements and expressly 
disavows participation in such pacts. The Court finds this particular Ethics Code is a factor to consider in determining whether 
the CCAC adequately pleads facts supporting a strong inference of scienter. "
1751,8," The existence of such investigations is not sufficient, standing alone, to support a strong inference of scienter but is not 
irrelevant to the analysis. Konkol, 590 F.3d at 402 (6th Cir. 2010) (""Although a government investigation is not altogether 
irrelevant to the scienter analysis, a decision by government agencies to investigate a company is not sufficient to meet the 
heightened Tellabs standard on its own . . . .""). Additionally, as it did in In re Packaged Ice, ___ F. Supp. 2d ___, 2010 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 65549, 2010 WL 2671306 at * 15, this Court declines to attach significance, in favor of or against either party, to 
statements made in the related criminal proceedings about the scope of the government investigation, which in any event result 
in a neutral stance on the part of the government as to these civil proceedings. Id. On a related note, the Court will grant Defendants Reddy Ice,  [**84] Brick and Janusek's motion to supplement their motion to 
dismiss and considers the statement, contained in Reddy Ice's Form 8-K filed with the SEC on October 29, 2010 and November 
1, 2010, that Reddy Ice has issued a press release announcing that its counsel has been notified by the Antitrust Division of the 
Department of Justice that the DOJ will take no action against Reddy or its employees in connection with the DOJ's criminal 
investigation of the packaged ice industry. (Dkt. No. 82.) The Court declines, as discussed above, to attach undue significance to 
any decision of the government to circumscribe its criminal investigation. The Court also notes the lesser standard of proof 
required in this civil matter. "
1754,9," Defendants argue that this press release does not imply that Mr. Key is associated with matters under investigation by the 
DOJ. The press release discusses Mr. Key's suspension for likely violating company policy and being associated with matters 
under investigation and in the next sentence discusses the DOJ investigation. Defendants put too fine an interpretation on this 
press release which is fairly understood to say that Mr. Key has likely violated company policy and is associated with matters 
under investigation  [**97] by the antitrust division of the DOJ. The press release does not mention any other matters that ""under 
investigation"" and the Court finds that Plaintiffs' interpretation of this press release is not a ""mischaracterization."" (Defs.' Mot. Ex. 
L.) "
1759,1," Defendants cite to Ikon Office Solutions, Inc. v. Am. Office Prods., Inc., 178 F. Supp. 2d 1154 (D. Or. 2001), which held that the 
defendant was entitled to summary judgment on a claim for misappropriation of trade secrets because the plaintiff had not 
established that certain customer information constituted a trade secret. The information in that case included the identity of the 
plaintiff's customers, names of contact persons at those companies, information regarding each account, and pricing information 
and marketing strategies of the plaintiff. Id. at 1167-70. However, that information was not considered to be a trade secret 
because Eugene, Oregon, was a ""small market"" and ""only a few dozen names"" were at issue, so a competitor could easily learn 
all the necessary information by doing its own research, and there was no evidence  [*8] that information regarding pricing or 
marketing was actually taken. Id. This case, in contrast, involves information that would take considerable time and effort to 
obtain. Defendants Rezente and Friend were themselves responsible for ""several hundred"" customers and ""275 Ikon 
customers,"" respectively (FAC ¶¶ 18, 25), and Rezente is alleged to have misappropriated information for ""all or almost all of the 
customers serviced by Ikon's entire Sacramento sales force."" (Id. ¶ 42.) These allegations are sufficient to allege trade secrets 
for purposes of a motion to dismiss. "
1760,2," To the extent that plaintiff relies on a theory of inevitable disclosure, which is not recognized in California, the misappropriation 
claim must fail. See FLIR Systems, Inc. v. Parrish, 174 Cal. App. 4th 1270, 1277, 95 Cal. Rptr. 3d 307 (2d Dist. 2009). However, 
plaintiff also alleges wrongful acquisition and actual use, which are proper theories of misappropriation. (See, e.g., FAC ¶¶ 41-
43, 46-50, 60-61.)"
1760,3," The fact that Rezente was still an employee at the time is not dispositive. See Courtesy Temp. Serv., Inc. v. Camacho, 222 Cal. 
App. 3d 1278, 1287-91, 272 Cal. Rptr. 352 (2d Dist. 1990) (granting preliminary injunction for misappropriation of customer 
information that former employee allegedly acquired while still employed by former employer). Plaintiff has clearly alleged the 
precautions it took to keep the information within the company. (See FAC ¶¶ 37-40.)"
1760,4," Defendants' contention that plaintiff  [*11] must show that public policy weighs in favor of the protection is incorrect. Such a 
showing was required under the common law, but is not required under CUTSA. See O'Very v. Spectratek Techs., Inc., No. CV 
03-00540, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 31095, 2004 WL 5642004, at *5 (C.D. Cal. July 26, 2004)."
1760,5," Defendants argue that plaintiff's non-CUTSA claims are also barred by Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 16600, which states that 
""[e]xcept as provided in this chapter, every contract by which anyone is restrained from engaging in a lawful profession, trade, or "
1761,," business of any kind  [*13] is to that extent void."" Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 16600. It is unclear why this statute, which bars 
restrictive covenants in employment contracts, would apply to tort claims not based on any contract. See Edwards v. Arthur 
Andersen LLP, 44 Cal. 4th 937, 941, 81 Cal. Rptr. 3d 282, 189 P.3d 285 (2008) (holding that noncompetition agreements 
between employers and employees are invalid under section 16600); Retirement Grp. v. Galante, 176 Cal. App. 4th 1226, 
1238, 98 Cal. Rptr. 3d 585 (4th Dist. 2009) (""section 16600 bars a court from specifically enforcing (by way of injunctive relief) a 
contractual clause purporting to ban a former employee from soliciting former customers to transfer their business away from the 
former employer to the employee's new business, but a court may enjoin tortious conduct (as violative of either the Uniform 
Trade Secrets Act and/or the Unfair Competition Law) by banning the former employee from using trade secret information . . . 
."")."
1761,6," Whether or not defendants were fiduciaries of plaintiff, they would still owe a duty of loyalty as employees. See Otsuka v. Polo 
Ralph Lauren Corp., No. C 07-02780, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 86523, 2007 WL 3342721, at *2-3 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 9, 2007) 
(denying motion to dismiss breach of fiduciary duty claim and construing it as a breach of duty of loyalty claim); James v. "

1788,1," The '675 patent is not directly at issue here, but is relevant prior art. "
1789,2," In this citation, ERBE Elektromedizin GmbH was spelled ERBE Electromedizin GmbH. "
1792,3," In light of our conclusion on the construction of ""low flow rate,"" we need not reach ERBE's challenge to the construction of other 
claim terms. "
1795,4," Further, as Canady argues, ERBE's only competitor, ConMed, has been using blue on its probes since January 2002. ERBE 
acknowledged that ConMed uses blue flexible endoscopic probes during the prosecution of the '630 trademark. J.A. 3862. 
There, ERBE noted that there was a pending lawsuit in the Northern District of New York against ConMed for ""selling similar 
looking tubes as part of its flexible endoscopic probes for use in argon plasma coagulation, in apparent infringement of the '745 
patent."" Id. ERBE, however, admits that the '745 patent ""does not disclose or claim the color blue for the tube portions of the 
probes."" Id. ERBE does not demonstrate that the lawsuit in the Northern District of New York involved trademark or trade dress 
claims, or that the resulting settlement licensed  [**32] this color blue to ConMed. ERBE also fails to present evidence that it 
licensed the '630 trademark to ConMed. Rather, the record evidence shows that at least one of ERBE's competitors, ConMed, 
uses blue flexible endoscopic probes for use in argon plasma coagulation and thus ERBE does not maintain exclusive use. E.T. 
Browne Drug Co., 538 F.3d at 199."
1795,5," The dissent does not identify any evidence that ERBE presents relating to the required association formed in the minds of 
consumers between the mark and the source or origin of the product. The dissent further ignores the evidence demonstrating 
that at least one of ERBE's competitors uses blue flexible endoscopic probes—and thus the requisite secondary meaning is 
missing here. "

1807,5," In January 2004, Tynkkynen became the Executive Vice President of Resources and Business Support Functions of UPM. "
1811,6," Neither Tynkkynen nor Korhonen recall the topic of discussion. To the extent that plaintiffs claim that it can be inferred that the 
men discussed the impending IP increase, evidence necessitating an inference cannot be characterized as direct evidence. See 
In re Baby Food Antitrust Litig., 166 F.3d at 118."
1811,7," The DOJ notes memorializing its interview with Tynkkynen are the subject of the defendants' motion to strike (doc. # 560). As 
set forth above at note 2, the motion is denied as moot. I will, however, consider the DOJ notes for the limited purpose of 
addressing plaintiffs' claims concerning the February 2003  [*44] price increase. With respect to plaintiffs' argument that 
Korhonen's statements to the DOJ are similarly inconsistent and therefore evidence of an agreement between Korhonen and "
1812,," Tynkkynen, the claim is without merit. See doc. # 566 at 12 (Korhonen's criminal trial testimony that he did not recall telling DOJ 
investigators that had Tynkkynen conveyed to Korhonen that UPM was not going to follow IP's price increase, Korhonen would 
not have permitted SENA to follow). The testimony does not create a genuine issue of material fact concerning the February 
2003 price increase. What Korhonen might have done under different circumstances is irrelevant; here, the record demonstrates 
only that SENA arrived at a decision to follow the IP increase wholly independently of any decision by UPM to do so as well. "
1813,8," Plaintiffs, it appears, have crafted their response to defendants' motion to fit the analysis in In re EPDM, 681 F. Supp. 2d 141 
(D. Conn. 2009). The comparison fails. At summary judgment the EPDM plaintiffs  [*51] had evidence of hundreds of inter-firm 
communications that supported the existence of an agreement between the defendants to take turns leading price increases. 
Furthermore, the EPDM defendants undertook efforts to conceal the nature of their relationship by using false names and 
destroying e-mails. They also sold product to competitors at below market prices rather than seeking to co-opt customers when 
competitors experienced supply problems. The facts of the instant case are easily distinguishable. "
1823,1," The Court notes that Plaintiff has abandoned its separate claim for unjust enrichment and instead merely seeks restitution as a 
remedy. "
1833,1," The direct action plaintiffs are fifty-six potential class members who have opted out of the class certified in the main action and 
who have filed two separate lawsuits. In this memorandum and order, the term ""plaintiffs"" refers to the direct action plaintiffs."
1833,2, Parallel price increases are price increases of competitors that occur at or near the same point in time.

instead of framing the argument in a way that demonstrates why the discovery defendants seek is relevant, they merely attack 
plaintiffs' assertions that the discovery is irrelevant. This approach unwisely leaves it to the court to interpret defendants' "
1836,," relevancy arguments to the extent possible given the record presented. At the risk of stating what should be obvious, it would be 
a profound mistake for defense counsel to assume the court will be so indulgent in the future."

1838,30," In Kiefer-Stewart Co. v. Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, the Supreme Court approved a jury instruction that the alleged 
participation by the plaintiffs, liquor wholesalers, in a conspiracy to set the minimum price for the sale of liquor was not a defense 
to the plaintiffs' antitrust action against the defendants, liquor distributors, for allegedly conspiring to fix maximum prices above 
which wholesalers could not resell liquor. 340 U.S. 211, 214, 71 S. Ct. 259, 95 L. Ed. 219(1951) (overruled on other grounds by 
Copperweld Corp., 467 U.S. at 765-66). Similarly, in Perma Life Mufflers, Inc. v. Int'l Parts Corp., the  [*47] Supreme Court disapproved of the common law doctrine of in 
pari delicto (literally meaning ""of equal fault"") in antitrust cases. 392 U.S. 134, 140, 88 S. Ct. 1981, 20 L. Ed. 2d 982 (1968) 
(overruled on other grounds by Copperweld Corp., 467 U.S. at 765-66). The plaintiffs had participated in the conspiracy by 
utilizing and profiting from the defendants' illegal arrangements, and it was this participation that was urged as a bar to their 
bringing actions against the active participants. Id. at 138. The Court held that the fact that the plaintiffs had benefitted from the 
defendants' restrictive arrangements did not prevent their suing under the antitrust laws. The Court reasoned that there was 
nothing in the language of the antitrust acts showing an intent by Congress to make a common law doctrine a defense to a 
private suit that serves important public purposes. Id."
1838,31," Defendants raise a third argument that this discovery could be used to impeach the credibility of witnesses who testified during 
depositions that they did not speak with competitors about foam pricing or monitor their  [*48] competitors' prices. However, 
defendants have cited no authority, and the court can find none, holding that discovery may be compelled simply because it may 
give rise to impeaching information. Nevertheless, the discovery in this second category is ordered compelled for the other 
reasons discussed. "

] In Illinois Brick, the Supreme Court prohibited federal antitrust suits by indirect purchasers. Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois,"
1850,431," U.S. 720, 728, 97 S. Ct. 2061, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1977). Following Illinois Brick, a number of states including Illinois and New 
York passed so-called ""Illinois Brick repealers,"" which established the right of an indirect purchaser to bring an antitrust claim 
under state law. See, e.g., Jonathan T. Tomlin & Dale J. Giali, Federalism And The Indirect Purchaser Mess, 11 George Mason 
L. Rev. 157, 161 (2002). "
1851,2," HN11[
] Class actions for indirect purchasers that are not brought by the Attorney General within Illinois are also dismissed. 
See, e.g., Gaebler v. N.M. Potash Corp., 285 Ill. App. 3d 542, 676 N.E.2d 228, 230, 221 Ill. Dec. 707 (Ill. App. Ct. 1996);

1859,3," Plaintiffs  [*8] argue the evidence relied upon does not support the new antitrust and tortious interference claims. However, at 
this juncture, it is inappropriate for the court to weigh the evidence or rule on the merits of the proposed claims. "
1861,4," Plaintiffs have not argued that the parent/subsidiary relationship between OCH, Winnercomm and Skycam Inc. renders futile 
the other antitrust claims defendants seek to assert."
1861,5," ""Probable cause"" is a reasonable belief in the existence of the facts upon which the claim is based and a reasonable belief that 
under such facts the claim may be valid either at common law or under an existing statute. Greenberg v. Wolfberg, 1994 OK

to File Counterclaim and Third Party Complaint. [Doc. No. 100 at 1]. In the section of their argument addressing the proposed 
Third Party Complaint, though, they erroneously referred to the third party defendants as Cablecom, Inc. and Winnercomm 
instead of OCH and Winnercomm. [Id. at 5]. Defendants assert  [*20] this resulted in a waiver of plaintiffs' objection to the Motion 
for Leave to Amend with respect to OCH. However, the error was corrected in plaintiffs' surreply. [Doc. No. 111 at 1]. "
1888,1," Mattel's unopposed motion to consolidate the summary judgment motions is granted subject to the general rule set forth in City 
of Las Vegas."
1888,2," Mattel argues that it does not matter whether the Inventions Agreement encompasses ideas because the Bratz name was 
contained in a stylized logo and the Inventions Agreement indisputably assigned Bryant's right, title and interest in his designs. 
But owning the idea is distinct from owning the design, since Mattel seeks to capture the enhancement in value of the former 
and not the latter."
1888,3," Extrinsic evidence is also provisionally accepted to determine whether the contract  [**23] is reasonably susceptible to the 
parties' competing interpretations and, if it is, ""extrinsic evidence relevant to prove either of such meanings is admissible."" Pacific "

Connecticut General Life Ins. Co., 847 F.2d 564, 569 (9th Cir. 1988). "
1891,4," HN6[
] Labor Code § 2870 bars the assignment of inventions developed on an employee's own time, unless (1) the employee used the employer's materials or information; (2) the invention relates at the time of conception or practice to the employer's 
business, or actual or demonstrably anticipated  [**32] research or development of the employer; or (3) the invention results 
from any work performed by the employee for the employer. The Inventions Agreement acknowledged that its assignment ""does 
not apply to an invention which qualifies under the provision of Section 2870."" Proctor Dec., Ex. 124. "
1893,5," A comparison of protectable elements, as opposed to the works as a whole ensures that unprotectable expression does not 
form the basis for a determination of substantial similarity, thereby ""confer[ring] a monopoly of the idea upon the copyright 
owner."" Aliotti v. R. Dakin & Co., 831 F.2d 898, 901 (9th Cir. 1987). Because the intrinsic test was designed to compare 
expression, the Ninth Circuit initially held that an analytical dissection of similarities ""properly may be assimilated within the 
analytical framework of the intrinsic test."" Id. However, the Ninth Circuit now requires that the analytical dissection take place at 
the extrinsic stage."
1893,6," HN10[
] At the extrinsic stage, the court determines the standard for infringement that will be ""applied at the 'intrinsic' stage."" 
Ninth Circuit  [**40] Op. at 10541. ""If there's a wide range of expression . . . then copyright protection is 'broad' and a work will 
infringe if it's 'substantially similar' to the copyrighted work. If there's only a narrow range of expression . . . then copyright 
protection is 'thin' and a work must be 'virtually identical' to infringe."" Id."
1893,7," MGA's statement of uncontroverted facts asserts that Bryant's sculpt did not infringe certain sculpt drawings. However, MGA 
does not identify the specific sculpt drawings that are the subject of its motion, and the Court declines to visit the issue sua 
sponte. "
1894,8," By the same token, a reasonable jury could find that the sculpts are virtually identical overall."
1894,9," This does not constitute a finding that subsequent generation dolls infringe. The grant of summary judgment on that issue is 
absolute."
1894,10," The Court has considered TX 1107, TX 1108, TX 1109, and TX 1110, since MGA moves for summary judgment as to all 
sketches that were the subject of the jury's phase 1 verdict. In its reply, MGA states that these drawings were jointly authored by 
MGA and Bryant, even though the phase 1 jury never made a finding of joint authorship. Having reviewed the testimony cited by 
MGA's reply brief, the Court finds a genuine issue of material fact as to the joint authorship of these sketches. "
1895,11," The Court notes that the different cheek tones may simply be a consequence of the fact that the mass production of the dolls 
did not allow for the intensity of cheek color in Bryant's drawings. "
1898,12," Mattel attempts to construct another support for its copyright infringement counter-claim by arguing that all generations of the 
Bratz dolls infringe the ""character"" in Bryant's original sketches. HN12[
] ""In determining whether the characters are similar, a 
court looks at the 'totality of [the characters'] attributes and traits as well as the extent to which the defendants' characters 
capture the 'total concept and feel' of figures in [plaintiff's work]."" Hogan v. DC Comics, 48 F. Supp. 2d 298, 309-10 (S.D.N.Y. 
1999). ""No character infringement claim can succeed unless plaintiff's original conception sufficiently developed the character, 
and defendants have copied this development,  [**59] and not merely the broader outlines."" Smith v. Weinstein, 578 F. Supp. 
1297, 1303 (S.D.N.Y. 1984), aff'd mem., 738 F.2d 419 (2d Cir. 1984). Similarity between characters cannot ""exist[] only at a 
level of abstraction too basic to permit any inference that defendant[] wrongfully appropriated any 'expression' of plaintiff's 
ideas."" Arden v. Columbia Pictures Indus., Inc., 908 F. Supp. 1248, 1261 (S.D.N.Y. 1995). Mattel thus cannot claim a coypright 
in the Bratz character circumvent the rule that the copying of the idea and expression required by the idea does not constitute 
infringement. If no reasonable fact-finder could find substantial similarity in the protectable expression, Mattel fails the extrinsic 
test. "
1902,13," Other jurisdictions have concluded that possession of a trade secret is all that is required. See Metso Minerals Indus., Inc. v. 
FLSmidth-Excel LLC, 733 F. Supp. 2d 969, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44967, 2010 WL 1850139, at *2 (E.D. Wis. May 7, 2010). 
However, Mattel's possession of the Bratz concept is likewise conditioned on the assignment of Bryant's ideas and inventions. "
1905,14," The Court will not consider the notes from that meeting, which are hearsay."
1905,15," Mattel actually claims that the Swappin' Styles theme contains ""one or more trade secrets,"" with no more specificity than that. 
Mattel's Statement of Genuine Issues ¶ 102. Mattel's lack of specificity forecloses it from claiming as  [**85] a trade secret 
anything more than the unreleased product idea for swappable fashions and heads. See Silvaco Data Sys. v. Intel Corp., 184 
Cal. App. 4th 210, 221, 109 Cal. Rptr. 3d 27 (2010). Mattel has also abandoned its counter-claim to the extent predicated upon 
other information allegedly misappropriated by Brawer and MGA's motion is granted as unopposed as to this information. "
1906,16," For instance, other than the self-serving testimony of its own employee, MGA has presented no evidence as to whether the 
concept  [**87] for a doll with interchangeable heads and fashions was well-known or had been attempted before MyScene 
Swappin' Styles. Nor has MGA presented evidence about the value a manufacturer obtains from being ""first to market"" with a 
doll concept. ABBA Rubber Co. v. Seaquist, 235 Cal. App. 3d 1, 21, 286 Cal. Rptr. 518 (1991) (HN19[
] ""[I]nformation can be a 
trade secret even if it is readily ascertainable, so long as it has not yet been ascertained"")."
1906,17," Mattel argues that its efforts to maintain the secrecy of the Swappin' Styles product plan proves the information was valuable. 
Though efforts to maintain secrecy may sometimes be a relevant to the value of the information, Mattel has not shown that these 
materials enjoyed any special protections unique from the protections Mattel provided to every other document in its database."
1906,18, MGA's motion is granted as unopposed as to these categories of alleged trade secrets. 
1910,19," The Court denies Mattel's request for an adverse inference from Castilla's invocation of his Fifth Amendment right against self-
incrimination during his deposition. Castilla is not a party to Mattel's third counter-claim and Mattel suffered no prejudice as a 
result of Castilla's failure to substantively respond to questions about whether and to what extent he downloaded Mattel's 
information prior to his departure. See SEC v. Colello, 139 F.3d 674, 677-78 (9th Cir. 1998) (collecting cases). Mattel 
independently discovered and tracked Castilla's wrongdoing through its forensic hardware analysis, and then petitioned federal 
authorities to get involved. In all events, Castilla's invocations of his right against self-incrimination were only in response to 
questions about his conduct prior to starting work at MGA, which is irrelevant to disclosure and use."
1910,20," For example, Mattel failed to modify generic language in a post-resignation form letter to Castilla. See Ex. 8340 to MGA MSJ. "
1912,21," MGA's heavy reliance on Cooney's deposition testimony is an independent grounds on which to deny summary judgment. Not 
only does Cooney still work for MGA but his conduct is at issue."
1912,22," Mattel's motion for summary judgment on the issues of whether Machado, Vargas, and Trueba stole information, and whether 
MGA is chargeable for those thefts, is denied. UTSA applies to trade secrets; the misappropriation of other information is 
irrelevant to stating a claim under UTSA."
1912,23," Mattel purports to dispute this fact in its Statement of Genuine Issues in Support of its Opposition to MGA's Motion. Mattel's 
Statement of Genuine Issues ¶ 269. However, at oral argument, Mattel's counsel acknowledged that Machado was an employee 
of Mattel Servicios. Nevertheless, there is no genuine issue of material fact that Machado was a Mattel Servicios employee. "
1915,24," The Circuits appear to be in dispute as to whether the court should resolve factual issues relevant to the choice of law. See 
Nautilus Ins. Co. v. Reuter, 537 F.3d 733, 742 (7th Cir. 2008) (comparing cases). This Court simply notes that, in this case, the 
factual dispute runs to the heart of Mattel's claim against Machado and its resolution would require the examination of evidence 
not cited by the parties' submissions."
1915,25," Different issues may be analyzed under different states' laws. See Wash. Mutual Bank, FA v. Superior Court, 24 Cal.4th 906, 
103 Cal. Rptr. 2d 320, 15 P.3d 1071 (2001). MGA, however, does not seek to apply the laws of different fora to each element of 
the third counter-claim for misappropriation of trade secrets. "
1916,26, Mattel's claim would be time-barred under Mexican law. The Court examines the third counter-claim under only the UTSA. 
1917,27, Mattel's objection is overruled. Larian's statements to Machado are not being offered for their truth.
1917,28," Machado's request for the entry of summary judgment on the issue of use as to a vast majority of the documents is likewise 
denied. The issue of use can be proved with circumstantial evidence. "
1918,29," Indeed, MGA offers little argument about the documents and information in its moving papers. More targeted 
 [**140] argument can be found in MGA's Statement of Uncontroverted Facts in support of its motion. "
1921,30," Contrary to Mattel's argument, MGA did not waive its right to raise a supersession argument by failing to assert the argument 
prior to the phase 1 trial, because (1) Mattel did not identify the Bratz concept as a trade secret during phase 1; (2) Mattel's 
broad amendment opened the door to the assertion of new affirmative defenses; and (3) there is on-point intervening California 
authority. "
1923,31," MGA argues that a trade secret allegation based upon Bryant's disclosure and MGA's acquisition of the Bratz trade secrets is 
likewise preempted by Section 106 of the Copyright Act. But these allegations also depend upon the ""extra element"" of secrecy. "
1925,32," It is undisputed that Brawer owed a fiduciary duty to Mattel by virtue of his position as an officer of the company. The scope of 
that duty was much broader than the fiduciary obligations, if any, assumed by Mattel's other employees. Daniel Orifice Fitting 
Co. v. Whalen, 198 Cal. App. 2d 791, 800, 18 Cal. Rptr. 659 (1962). But Mattel does not allege that Brawer engaged in any 
misconduct other than the misappropriation of its information. "
1928,33," MGA claims that the Copyright Act preempts this counter-claim to the extent predicated upon MGA inducing Bryant to ""convey 
his drawings and his purported interest in sculpts, and the ideas embodied in those copyrightable works."" Mattel doesn't make 
this allegation, however. Instead, Mattel predicates its intentional interference with contractual relations counter-claim on MGA's 
inducement of Bryant to work for MGA while still employed by Mattel and MGA's inducement to Bryant to not disclose his 
inventions to Mattel. 4AAC ¶ 161. Bryant couldn't have ""breached"" the clause assigning his works to Mattel, since the 
assignment was automatic; indeed, the immediacy of the assignment is the foundation for Mattel's interpretation of the 
Inventions Agreement. "
1941,34," Section 1125 provides that: HN73[
] The owner of a famous mark shall be entitled, subject to the principles of equity and upon such terms as the 
court deems reasonable, to an injunction against another person's commercial use in commerce of a mark or trade name, if 
such use begins after the mark has become famous and causes dilution of the distinctive quality of the  [**216] mark, and 
to obtain such other relief as is provided in this subsection. "
1942,15, U.S.C. § 1125(c)(1). 
1947,35," Contrary to Mattel's argument,  [**233] the principle discussed in Massey — that an amended pleading washes away prior 
pleadings — makes no sense if limited to new and unmentioned affirmative defenses, especially where, as here, the amended 
pleading significantly alters the scope of the case. "
1949,36, Mattel does not specifically allege these injuries in its pleading. 
1951,37," These Ninth Circuit cases could be read to hold that there's no property interest in honest services to begin with, however, 
such an interpretation would appear to run afoul of the federal honest services fraud statute."
1951,38, This citation to Holmes was erroneously omitted from the courtesy copy distributed to counsel. 
1956,39," Mattel has no evidence that Trueba's emails to Machado are ""communications in interstate or foreign commerce."" 18 U.S.C. § 
1343. Both Machado and Trueba resided in Mexico City at the time of the emails. In some cases, ""it is possible for a wire 
communication whose origin and ultimate destination are within a single state to be routed through another state"" but Mattel 
does not so establish here. See Ideal Steel Supply Corp. v. Anza, 373 F.3d 251, 265 (2d Cir. 2004), rev'd on other grounds, 547 
U.S. 451, 126 S.Ct. 1991, 164 L. Ed. 2d 720 (2006). Mattel's theory would require a fact-finder to conclude that Trueba's emails 
to Machado were routed into the United States and then back to Mexico. "
1958,40," There isn't a consensus on whether future revenues, even when easily calculable, constitute ""business or property."" See Hemi 
Group, 130 S.Ct. at 988 (""[We] do not decide whether the City's allegations of lost tax revenue constitute an injury to its 
'business or property.'""). "
1959,41," Mattel argues that ""Hasbro is not the plaintiff here; Mattel, the direct victim of the alleged wrongdoing, is."" Mattel Opp'n to MGA 
MSJ at 95:19-20. This argument conflates the different injuries suffered by Mattel, some of which (loss of trade secrets) were 
unique to Mattel and others (loss of profits) were not. Mattel suggests that MGA's deliberate attempts to eat into Mattel's market 
share establishes intent, which would distinguish Mattel's claim from other manufacturers' potential claims. Intent, however, is 
immaterial to RICO's proximate cause inquiry. See Anza, 547 U.S. at 460 (holding that plaintiff cannot ""circumvent the proximate 
cause requirement simply by claiming that the defendant's aim was to increase [**277]  market share at a competitor's 
expense""). "
1963,42," Mattel's request to add Cabrera, Morales and Salazar as members is denied. "
1981,1," Also pending are the motions for leave to exceed the page limitation in memoranda respecting the motion to dismiss, one filed 
by defendants Dominion Resources, Inc., and Dominion Transmission, Inc., and the other by the plaintiffs. It is ORDERED that 
both of the motions to exceed the page limitation be, and they hereby are, granted."
1981,2," Although plaintiffs allege in their complaint that each of the named defendants was required to report weekly gas supply levels 
to EIA, there is no evidence demonstrating that Dominion Resources, Inc., Dominion Virginia Power, or Dominion North Carolina 
Power were under such an obligation. In any event, only Dominion Transmission's reporting efforts are pertinent in this matter. "
1982,3," Inasmuch as plaintiffs' complaint arises from Dominion Transmission's reporting error and the alleged higher natural gas prices 
that followed, it is unclear why plaintiffs named as party defendants Dominion Virginia and Dominion North Carolina, both of 
which distribute electricity. Other than asserting that Dominion Virginia and Dominion North Carolina are principally located in 
Virginia and North Carolina, respectively, plaintiffs make no other allegations regarding these entities. "
1986,4," The Ninth Circuit recognized in Gallo that its ruling ""could leave [the plaintiff-consumer] without a remedy for [the defendant's] 
misconduct."" 503 F.3d at 1044. The court determined, however, that this equitable consideration did not compel a different 
result, inasmuch as a ""finding that federal law provides a shield for the challenged conduct  [*23] will almost always leave the 
state-law violation unredressed."" Id. at 1044-45."
1986,5," Gallo also undermines plaintiffs' alternative contention that the filed-rate doctrine is inapplicable inasmuch as their suit 
challenges retail natural gas rates, over which FERC lacks jurisdiction. The Ninth Circuit observed that the filed-rate doctrine 
may serve ""as a defense to actions putatively attacking retail rates, but having the effect of disallowing FERC-approved 
wholesale rates,"" reasoning that the retail rates arose from ""upstream FERC-approved wholesale rates."" Gallo, 503 F.3d at 
1044. "
1987,6," A different conclusion is not warranted simply because plaintiffs seek other forms of damages in addition to their claim for 
compensatory relief. Plaintiffs' claim for punitive damages is without merit, inasmuch as punitive damages are not recoverable 
when compensatory damages cannot be awarded. See Garnes v. Fleming Landfill, Inc., 186 W. Va. 656, 667, 413 S.E.2d 897, 
908 (1991). Likewise, plaintiffs have not identified a statutory or contractual basis for recovery of attorneys' fees, nor can they 
otherwise lay claim to recovery of fees and costs as a ""prevailing"" party. See syl. pt. 6, Miller v. Lambert, 196 W. Va. 24, 467 
S.E.2d 165 (1995) "
1997,1," Defendant Samsung Electronics America, Inc. (SEA) initially joined this motion. However, the Court granted summary judgment 
on all claims against it, pursuant to a stipulation by the parties. Docket No. 1131. "
2029,1," The named Plaintiffs are Precision Associates, Inc., a Minnesota corporation, Anything Goes LLC d/b/a Mail Boxes Etc., a

2030,3," The Original Complaint in this action was filed on January 3, 2008 and the plaintiffs filed an Amended Class Action Complaint 
on July 21, 2009. In order to allow the plaintiffs to make ministerial changes to complaint to meet requirements for service for 
some of those defendants located abroad, the parties stipulated to the filing of a Second Amended Class Action Complaint with 
only those changes. That Complaint was filed on October 7, 2010. All of the motions to dismiss are deemed responsive the most 
recently filed Complaint. "
2031,4," The six freight forwarder defendants who have agreed to plead guilty to charges  [*17] contained in separate Criminal 
Informations filed by the Department of Justice are EGL Inc., Kï¿½hne + Nagel International AG, Geologistics International 
Management (Bermuda) Limited, Panalpina World Transport (Holding) Ltd., Schenker AG, and BAX Global Inc. Id. "
2033,5," These defendants are identified as ""ABX Logistics, Dachser, DHL, Excel, Geodix (Geodix Wilson), Geo Logistics (Agility), 
Kuehne + Nagel, Panalpina, and Schenker."" In this claim, as in all the other local and regional conspiracy claims, some of the 
defendants identified in the heading of each claim actually refer to multiple defendants as defined in paragraphs 23-84 of the 
Complaint. "
2034,6," These defendants are identified in the heading of this claim as ""DHL, Exel, Kuehne + Nagel, Eagle, Hellmann, Emery, UPS 
(a/k/a Menlo Worldwide), Geo Logistics, Walker Freight, and Bax."""
2034,7," These defendants are Yusen Air & Sea Service Co., Ltd., Kintetsu World Express, Inc., Nishi-Nippon Railroad Co., Ltd., 
Hankyu Hanshin Express Holdings Corporation, Nissin Corporation, Vantec World Transport Co., Ltd., ""K"" Line Logistics, Ltd., 
Yamato Global Logistics Japan Co., Ltd., MOL Logistics (Japan) Co., Ltd., Hanshin Air Cargo Co., Ltd., United  [*28] Aircargo 
Consolidators, Inc., and Airborne Express, Inc. The plaintiffs also allege that the defendants DHL Global Forwarding Japan K.K. and Nippon Express Co., Ltd. joined this 
agreement no later than November 8, 2002. Id. ¶ 199. Although these two defendants are alleged to have joined the agreement 
at this time, they are not named as defendants in the heading of this Claim and the court does not read the Complaint as 
alleging Claim 2 as against them."
2034,8," The Claim 4 defendants are the same as the 2002 Fuel Surcharges Agreement Defendants in Claim 2 except with the 
exclusion of Airborne Express, Inc. and the addition of Nippon Express  [*29] Co., Ltd. and DHL Global Forwarding Japan K.K. "
2035,9, The defendants named in this Claim are the same as those named in Claim 4.
2035,10," The CAF Surcharge Defendants are identified as ""Exel, DHL, Eagle, Expeditors, Kuehne + Nagel, Panalpina, UPS, Kintetsu 
World Express, Yusen, Nippon Express, SDV, Dachser, Schenker, and Bax Global."" Compl. ¶ 57."
2035,11," The Claim 6 defendants are the same as those defined in Claim 5 with the exclusion of Dachser and Schenker and with the 
addition of ABX Logistics. Claim 6 also names SIFFA in the heading of this claim but SIFFA is not identified as a defendant in 
the Complaint, has not been served in this action and will not be considered as a defendant by the court. "
2036,12," These defendants, who are all named in Claims 7 through 9, are identified as ""Baltrans, DHL Danzas, Exel, Expeditors, Geo 
Logistics, Kuehne + Nagel, Panalpina, Bax, Schenker, UPS, Hellmann, SDV, ABX Logistics, Jet Speed, DFDS Transport, 
Morrison Express, and UTi."" "
2038,13," Claim 15 does not even make this allegation, claiming only that ""[a]s a direct result, Plaintiffs and other class members were 
injured in their property and are entitled to recover damages under 15 U.S.C. § 15."" Id. ¶ 326."
2038,14," The plaintiffs also make the conclusory, boilerplate allegation, tracking the statute, that ""[b]y reason of the alleged violations of 
the antitrust laws, Plaintiffs and members of the Class have been injured in their business and property and have suffered 
damages in an amount presently undetermined."" Id. ¶ 180. "
2042,15," A subsequent amended complaint in Flat Panel survived a motion to dismiss on the grouping issue where the plaintiffs 
alleged, inter alia, that the ""'individual participants entered into agreements on behalf of, and reported these meetings and 
discussions to, their respective corporate families'"" and that ""'the individual participants in conspiratorial meetings and 
discussions did not always know the corporate affiliation of their counterparts, nor did they distinguish between the entities within 
a corporate family.'"" In re: TFT-LCD (Flat Panel) Antitrust Litig., 599 F. Supp. 2d 1179, 1184-85 (N.D. Cal. 2009). There are no 
such allegations in the plaintiffs' Complaint. A recent decision by that court is in accord. See In re: TFT-LCD (Flat Panel) Antitrust 
Litig., 2010 U.S. DIST. LEXIS 64930, at *23-*24 (N.D. Cal. June 29, 2010)  [*58] (allegations as to a defendant's corporate 
status and that plaintiff purchased the product from defendant or its subsidiaries in the United States and elsewhere insufficient 
to allege defendant's participation in the price-fixing conspiracy). "
2043,16," These defendants contend that the plaintiffs are incorrect that certain of these defendants are indeed subsidiaries of named 
defendants as opposed to affiliates or sister subsidiaries. U.S. Subs. MTD at n.1. "
2044,17," The plaintiffs also maintain that the court must infer claims against the U.S. Subsidiaries in these counts because they ""allege 
very specific factual allegations regarding the actions of the Japanese Defendants in the international market for Freight 
Forwarding Services and allege  [*65] that these services were sold in the U.S."" and that therefore ""it is reasonable to infer, 
especially given the explicit allegations [that each defendant ""acted directly or through its subsidiaries and/or affiliates""] that the 
Japanese Defendants' U.S. subsidiaries were also parties to this conspiracy and assisted in executing it in the U.S."" U.S. Subs. 
MTD Opp. at 15. For the reasons stated in the main text, the court declines this request. Even if the court could infer that these 
claims are brought against the U.S. Subsidiaries, the plaintiffs run directly into the same corporate grouping problem described 
above."
2044,18," Following a pattern of ambiguity, the plaintiffs have thus failed to name thirteen defendants in any individual conspiracy claims: 
Air Express International Inc., DSV A/S, DSV Solutions Holding A/S, DB Schenker, Spedlogswiss, aka The Association of Swiss 
Forwarders, Japan Air Cargo Forwarders Association, Con-way, Inc., Yamato Transport U.S.A., Inc., MOL Logistics 
 [*67] (U.S.A.), Inc., Vantec World Transport (USA), Inc., Nissin International Transport USA, Inc., ""K"" Line Logistics (USA), Inc., 
and Hanshin Air Cargo USA, Inc. While these thirteen defendants do not appear in any of the individual conspiracy counts in 
Claims 1 through 10, they would be included in the allegations in Claim 14 which is brought against ""Defendants"" generally. For 
the reasons stated in Section V(C), below, Claim 14 fails to state a claim against any defendant because the plaintiffs have failed 
to allege a plausible global conspiracy. "
2045,19," The court declines the plaintiffs' request to take judicial notice of statements on the defendants' websites ""about their corporate 
unity and their seamless communications."" Tr. of Oral Arg. Sept. 15, 2010, Dkt. Entry 454, at 58, 61-62. HN13[
] ""Courts must consider the complaint in its entirety, as well as other  [*70] sources courts ordinarily examine when ruling on Rule 12(b)(6) 
motions to dismiss, in particular, documents incorporated into the complaint by reference, and matters of which a court may take 
judicial notice."" Tellabs, 551 U.S. at 322 (citation omitted); DiFolco v. MSNBC Cable L.L.C., 622 F.3d 104, 111 (2d Cir. 2010). 
Here, the websites were not quoted in or referenced in the Complaint so the only issue is whether they are subject to judicial 
notice. Cases cited by the plaintiffs that have taken judicial notice of websites on motions to dismiss have done so for the limited 
purpose of ascertaining an undisputed fact or the fact of the website's publication. See Ligon v. Doherty, 208 F. Supp. 2d 384, 
386 (E.D.N.Y. 2002) (where plaintiff failed to appear on dates ordered by court, court took judicial notice of the records posted by 
the New York State Department of Correctional Services that indicated that plaintiff was reincarcerated); In re UBS Auction Rate 
Sec. Litig., 08-2967, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 59024, 2010 WL 2541166, at *15 (S.D.N.Y. June 10, 2010) (""The Second Circuit, 
and several district courts in this Circuit, have found it appropriate to take judicial notice of the contents of a party's website for 
the  [*71] fact of its publication""). The statements the plaintiffs point to are not the type of readily ascertainable and undisputed 
facts that are normally subject to judicial notice since they would have the court rely on them as a basis for disregarding the 
corporate form."
2045,20," The Complaint defines these two entities as ""EGL,"" Compl. ¶ 29, but then contains references to both EGL and an undefined 
entity ""Eagle"" throughout. For the purposes of this motion and because the parties do the same, the court assumes that ""EGL"" 
and ""Eagle"" refer to the same grouped entities."
2045,21," Although not defined as such, these two entities are referred to collectively as ""UPS."" Moreover, Claim 3, which is brought 
against ""Emery"" and ""UPS (a/k/a Menlo Worldwide),"" neither of which are defendants, is assumed to be directed at ""UPS"" and 
should be dismissed as to them as well. See Compl. ¶¶ 58, 114, 208, 300,  [*73] and p. 53."
2045,22," Although the Complaint identified the two Geodis entities as ""Geodis"" the only specific claim against any of these entities is the 
claim in Claim 1 against ""Geodix (Geodix Wilson)."" The court infers that the plaintiffs intend to group the Geodis defendants 
here. "
2052,23," The defendants argue that the plaintiffs allegations amount to an implausible ""rimless wheel conspiracy"" where ""various 
defendants enter into separate agreements with a common defendant, but where the defendants have no connection with one 
another, other than the common defendant's involvement in each transaction."" Dickson v. Microsoft Corp., 309 F.3d 193, 203 
(4th Cir. 2002). In Dickson, the court found that the plaintiffs had failed to allege a single conspiracy among Microsoft and 
various computer  [*100] manufacturers, despite common involvement of Microsoft with each computer manufacturer. The 
plaintiffs had failed to provide allegations linking the separate computer manufacturers to a common conspiracy. The plaintiffs 
deny that they have attempted to allege a hub-and-spokes conspiracy. Joint MTD Opp. at 24 n. 21. Even if they have, the theory 
would not be plausible since they have not provided the court with any allegation beyond the naming of the DHL defendants in 
nine of the ten local conspiracies to connect all ten of them. "
2053,24," The plaintiffs also rely on Air Cargo MDL and other decisions for the proposition that the government antitrust investigations 
involved here (and subsequent agreements to plead guilty) support the plausibility of the overarching conspiracies. Joint MTD 
Opp. at 38-40. Both the JFTC and the Department of Justice, however, chose  [*107] to charge individual conspiracies, some of 
which are similar to the local conspiracies in the Complaint, not a global conspiracy. While this does not preclude the finding of a 
global conspiracy, it does not support it either. "
2058,25," The defendants appear to dispute the allegations in the Complaint, arguing that ""the freight forwarding service at issue here 
ends when the freight is handed off to the carriers."" Joint MTD FTAIA at 1. Since this contention is contrary to the well-pleaded 
allegations in the Complaint and the Criminal Informations to which several of the defendants have agreed to plead guilty, it 
presents a factual issue that is more appropriately resolved at a later stage of the litigation. "
2059,26," The other cases cited by the defendants also involve wholly foreign conduct with minimal connection to United States markets. 
See McGlinchy v. Shell Chemical Co., 845 F.2d 802, 813 (9th Cir. 1988)  [*128] (court denied subject matter jurisdiction where 
American plaintiff ""pleaded only injury to customers or potential customers located in Southeast Asia"" or to himself for contracts 
to provide services in Southeast Asia); In re Intel Corp. Microprocessor Antitrust Litig., 452 F. Supp. 2d 555, 558-60 (D. Del. 
2006) (where plaintiff was seeking recovery for lost sales of foreign-made microprocessors sold in foreign countries, the fact that 
plaintiff was ""an American company engaged in a world-wide market [did] not create jurisdiction [with] substantial, direct effects 
on the domestic market"")."
2059,27," These defendants are Vantec  [*130] World Transport Co., Ltd., ABX Logistics Worldwide NV/SA, Dacsher GMBH (sued as 
""Dachser Intelligent Logistics""), DSV A/S, DSV Solutions Holding A/S, ""K"" Line Logistics, Ltd., MOL Logistics (Japan) Co., Ltd., 
Nippon Express Co., Ltd., Nissin Corporation, United Aircargo Consolidators, Inc., Yamato Global Logistics Japan Co., Ltd., 
Yusen Air & Sea Service Co., Ltd., Morrison Express Logistics PTE, Ltd., and Geodis S.A. (sued as ""Geodis Wilson""). "
2060,28," The plaintiffs provide no arguments in support of their claim of jurisdiction under the Clayton Act Section 12, which confers 
jurisdiction over a defendant in any district where it is found to ""transact business."" 15 U.S.C. § 22; Daniel v. Am. Bd. of 
Emergency Med., 428 F.3d 408, 428-29 (2d Cir. 2005). The court therefore does not address this issue."
2060,29," The plaintiffs do not assert that Geodis S.A. has a New York office, but rather allege that it acted through its subsidiary, which

includes a description of this company that states that ""[w]e have 95 professional employees working at our own office [sic] in 
Tokyo, Narita, Osaka and New York . . ."" Hedlund Decl., Ex. 29. The defendants dispute the accuracy of this statement, arguing 
that it is referring to the office of its former U.S. subsidiary. Foreign Defs. PJ MTD Reply at 2 n.3. Even if the accuracy of this 
website were not in dispute, the most it could establish is that United Aircargo Consolidators held itself out to the public as 
having an office in New York. This is not enough to show proof of ""doing business"" in New York absent additional facts 
demonstrating that the company solicited business in New York. Cf. United Mizrahi Bank Ltd. v. Sullivan, No. 97-9282, 1998 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13996, 1998 WL 575137, at *5 (holding onself out has having ""principle [sic] place of business in New York"" 
enough to establish jurisdiction). "
2063,31," As discussed in Section IV(B) above, the plaintiffs have not named these two entities in any of the local conspiracy counts and 
thus have not alleged that they were part of any conspiracy to fix surcharges for freight forwarding services. Therefore, there 
cannot be any transactions pleaded in the Complaint that would serve as the basis for jurisdiction over these entities under 
Section 302(a)(1). "
2064,32," The  [*150] plaintiffs' arguments in favor of jurisdiction under § 302(a)(3)(i) (defendants ""regularly does or solicits business"" in 
the state) are identical to those made in favor of jurisdiction under CPLR § 301 and likewise fail under this provision. "

2069,35," As a practical matter, recovery in this case will be extended beyond that period due to fraudulent concealment of the plaintiffs' 
claims by the defendants. "
2072,36," That the facts in the Air Cargo cases seem parallel to this one is not a mere coincidence; the cases appear to be related in 
origins and methods. For example, in Claim 1 the plaintiffs allege that the Security Surcharge Defendants conspired to offer to 
enter into an agreement with various airlines to impose an increased security surcharge, Compl.¶¶ 192-93, and in Claim 2, it is 
alleged that the 2002 Fuel Surcharges Defendants imposed the fuel surcharge each time they were assessed a fuel surcharge 
by an airline, Id. at ¶¶ 196-97. "
2085,1," Mattel's unopposed motion to consolidate the summary judgment motions is granted subject to the general rule set forth in City 
of Las Vegas. "
2086,2," Mattel argues that it does not matter whether the Inventions Agreement encompasses ideas because the Bratz name was 
contained in a stylized logo and the Inventions Agreement indisputably assigned Bryant's right, title and interest in his designs. 
But owning the idea is distinct from owning the design, since Mattel seeks to capture the enhancement in value of the former 
and not the latter."
2086,3," Extrinsic evidence is also provisionally accepted to determine whether the contract is reasonably susceptible to the parties' 
competing interpretations and, if it is, ""extrinsic evidence relevant to prove either of such meanings is admissible."" Pacific Gas & 
Elec. Co. v. G.W. Thomas Drayage & Rigging Co., Inc., 69 Cal.2d 33, 40, 69 Cal. Rptr. 561, 442 P.2d 641 (1968); Cf. Dore v.

General Life Ins. Co., 847 F.2d 564, 569 (9th Cir. 1988). "
2089,4," Labor Code § 2870 bars the assignment of inventions developed on an employee's own time, unless (1) the employee used 
the employer's materials or information; (2) the invention relates at the time of conception or practice to the employer's business, 
or actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development of the employer; or (3) the invention results from any work 
performed by the employee for the employer. The Inventions Agreement acknowledged that its assignment ""does not apply to an 
invention which qualifies under the provision of Section 2870."" Proctor Dec., Ex. 124. "
2091,5," A comparison of protectable elements, as opposed to the works as a whole, ensures that unprotectable expression does not 
form the basis for a determination of substantial similarity, thereby ""confer[ring] a monopoly of the idea upon the copyright 
owner."" Aliotti v. R. Dakin & Co., 831 F.2d 898, 901 (9th Cir. 1987). Because the intrinsic test was designed to compare 
expression, the Ninth Circuit initially held that an analytical dissection of similarities ""properly may be assimilated within the 
analytical framework of the intrinsic test."" Id. However, the Ninth Circuit now requires that the analytical dissection take place at 
the extrinsic stage."
2091,6," At the extrinsic stage, the court determines the standard for infringement that will be ""applied at the 'intrinsic' stage."" Ninth 
Circuit Op. at 10541. ""If there's a wide range of expression . . . then copyright protection is 'broad' and a work will infringe if it's 
'substantially similar' to the copyrighted work. If there's only a narrow range of expression . . . then copyright protection is 'thin' 
and a work must be 'virtually identical' to infringe."" Id."
2091,7," MGA's statement of uncontroverted facts asserts that Bryant's sculpt did not infringe certain sculpt drawings. However, MGA 
does not identify the specific sculpt drawings that are the subject of its motion, and the Court declines to visit the issue sua 
sponte. "
2092,8," By the same token, a reasonable jury could find that the sculpts are virtually identical overall."
2092,9," This does not constitute a finding that subsequent generation dolls infringe. The grant of summary judgment on that issue is 
absolute."
2092,10," The Court has considered TX 1107, TX 1108, TX 1109, and TX 1110, since MGA moves for summary judgment as to all 
sketches that were the subject of the jury's phase 1 verdict. In its reply, MGA states that these drawings were jointly authored by 
MGA and Bryant, even though the phase 1 jury never made a finding of joint authorship. Having reviewed the testimony cited by 
MGA's reply brief, the Court finds a genuine issue of material fact as to the joint authorship of these sketches. "
2093,11," The Court notes that the different cheek tones may simply be a consequence of the fact that the mass production of the dolls 
did not allow for the intensity of cheek color in Bryant's drawings. "
2096,12," Mattel attempts to construct another support for its copyright infringement counter-claim by arguing that all generations of the 
Bratz dolls infringe the ""character"" in Bryant's original sketches. ""In determining whether the characters are similar, a court looks 
at the 'totality of [the characters'] attributes and traits as well as the extent to which the defendants' characters capture the 'total 
concept and feel' of figures in [plaintiff's work]."" Hogan v. DC Comics, 48 F. Supp. 2d 298, 309-10 (S.D.N.Y. 1999). ""No 
character infringement claim can succeed unless plaintiff's original conception sufficiently developed the character, and 
defendants have copied this development, and not merely the broader outlines."" Smith v. Weinstein, 578 F. Supp. 1297, 1303 
(S.D.N.Y. 1984), aff'd mem., 738 F.2d 419 (2d Cir. 1984). Similarity between characters cannot ""exist[] only at a level of 
abstraction too basic to permit any inference that defendant[] wrongfully appropriated any 'expression' of plaintiff's ideas."" Arden 
v. Columbia Pictures Indus., 908 F. Supp. 1248, 1261 (S.D.N.Y. 1995). Mattel thus cannot claim a coypright in the Bratz 
character circumvent the rule that the copying of the idea and expression required by the idea does not constitute infringement. 
If no reasonable fact-finder could find substantial similarity in the protectable expression, Mattel fails the extrinsic test. "
2100,13," Other jurisdictions have concluded that possession of a trade secret is all that is required. See Metso Minerals Indus., Inc. v. 
FLSmidth-Excel LLC, 733 F. Supp. 2d 969, 2010 WL 1850139, at *2 (E.D. Wis. 2010). However, Mattel's possession of the Bratz 
concept is likewise conditioned on the assignment of Bryant's ideas and inventions. "
2103,14," The Court will not consider the notes from that meeting, which are hearsay."
2103,15," Mattel actually claims that the Swappin' Styles theme contains ""one or more trade secrets,"" with no more specificity than that. 
Mattel's Statement of Genuine Issues ¶ 102. Mattel's lack of specificity forecloses it from claiming as a trade secret anything 
more than the unreleased product idea for swappable fashions and heads. See Silvaco Data Sys. v. Intel Corp., 184 Cal. App. 
4th 210, 221, 109 Cal. Rptr. 3d 27 (2010). Mattel has also abandoned its counter-claim to the extent predicated upon other 
information allegedly misappropriated by Brawer and MGA's motion is granted as unopposed as to this information."
2103,16," For instance, other than the self-serving testimony of its own employee, MGA has presented no evidence as to whether the 
concept for a doll with interchangeable heads and fashions was well-known or had been attempted before MyScene Swappin' 
Styles. Nor has MGA presented evidence about the value a manufacturer obtains from being ""first to market"" with a doll concept. 
ABBA Rubber Co. v. Seaquist, 235 Cal. App. 3d 1, 21, 286 Cal. Rptr. 518 (1991) (""[I]nformation can be a trade secret even if it is 
readily ascertainable, so long as it has not yet been ascertained"")."
2103,17," Mattel argues that its efforts to maintain the secrecy of the Swappin' Styles product plan proves the information was valuable. 
Though efforts to maintain secrecy may sometimes be a relevant to the value of the information, Mattel has not shown that these 
materials enjoyed any special protections unique from the protections Mattel provided to every other document in its database. "
2104,18, MGA's motion is granted as unopposed as to these categories of alleged trade secrets. 
2107,19," The Court denies Mattel's request for an adverse inference from Castilla's invocation of his Fifth Amendment right against self-
incrimination during his deposition. Castilla is not a party to Mattel's third counter-claim and Mattel suffered no prejudice as a 
result of Castilla's failure to substantively respond to questions about whether and to what extent he downloaded Mattel's 
information prior to his departure. See SEC v. Colello, 139 F.3d 674, 677-78 (9th Cir. 1998) (collecting cases). Mattel 
independently discovered and tracked Castilla's wrongdoing through its forensic hardware analysis, and then petitioned federal 
authorities to get involved. In all events, Castilla's invocations of his right against self-incrimination were only in response to 
questions about his conduct prior to starting work at MGA, which is irrelevant to disclosure and use. "
2108,20," For example, Mattel failed to modify generic language in a post-resignation form letter to Castilla. See Ex. 8340 to MGA MSJ. "
2109,21," MGA's heavy reliance on Cooney's deposition testimony is an independent grounds on which to deny summary judgment. Not 
only does Cooney still work for MGA but his conduct is at issue. "
2110,22," Mattel's motion for summary judgment on the issues of whether Machado, Vargas, and Trueba stole information, and whether 
MGA is chargeable for those thefts, is denied. UTSA applies to trade secrets; the misappropriation of other information is 
irrelevant to stating a claim under UTSA."
2110,23," Mattel purports to dispute this fact in its Statement of Genuine Issues in Support of its Opposition to MGA's Motion. Mattel's 
Statement of Genuine Issues ¶ 269. However, at oral argument, Mattel's counsel acknowledged that Machado was an employee 
of Mattel Servicios. Nevertheless, there is no genuine issue of material fact that Machado was a Mattel Servicios employee. "
2112,24," The Circuits appear to be in dispute as to whether the court should resolve factual issues relevant to the choice of law. See 
Nautilus Ins. Co. v. Reuter, 537 F.3d 733, 742 (7th Cir. 2008) (comparing cases). This Court simply notes that, in this case, the 
factual dispute runs to the heart of Mattel's claim against Machado and its resolution would require the examination of evidence 
not cited by the parties' submissions. "
2113,25," Different issues may be analyzed under different states' laws. See Wash. Mutual Bank, FA v. Superior Court, 24 Cal.4th 906, 
103 Cal. Rptr. 2d 320, 15 P.3d 1071 (2001). MGA, however, does not seek to apply the laws of different fora to each element of 
the third counter-claim for misappropriation of trade secrets."
2113,26, Mattel's claim would be time-barred under Mexican law. The Court examines the third counter-claim under only the UTSA. 
2114,27, Mattel's objection is overruled. Larian's statements to Machado are not being offered for their truth. 
2115,28," Machado's request for the entry of summary judgment on the issue of use as to a vast majority of the documents is likewise 
denied. The issue of use can be proved with circumstantial evidence. "
2116,29," Indeed, MGA offers little argument about the documents and information in its moving papers. More targeted argument can be 
found in MGA's Statement of Uncontroverted Facts in support of its motion. "
2118,30," Contrary to Mattel's argument, MGA did not waive its right to raise a supersession argument by failing to assert the argument 
prior to the phase 1 trial, because (1) Mattel did not identify the Bratz concept as a trade secret during phase 1; (2) Mattel's 
broad amendment opened the door to the assertion of new affirmative defenses; and (3) there is on-point intervening California 
authority. "
2120,31," MGA argues that a trade secret allegation based upon Bryant's disclosure and MGA's acquisition of the Bratz trade secrets is 
likewise preempted by Section 106 of the Copyright Act. But these allegations also depend upon the ""extra element"" of secrecy. "
2122,32," It is undisputed that Brawer owed a fiduciary duty to Mattel by virtue of his position as an officer of the company. The scope of 
that duty was much broader than the fiduciary obligations, if any, assumed by Mattel's other employees. Daniel Orifice Fitting 
Co. v. Whalen, 198 Cal. App. 2d 791, 800, 18 Cal. Rptr. 659 (1962). But Mattel does not allege that Brawer engaged in any 
misconduct other than the misappropriation of its information. "
2126,33," MGA claims that the Copyright Act preempts this counter-claim to the extent predicated upon MGA inducing Bryant to ""convey 
his drawings and his purported interest in sculpts, and the ideas embodied in those copyrightable works."" Mattel doesn't make 
this allegation, however. Instead, Mattel predicates its intentional interference with contractual relations counter-claim on MGA's 
inducement of Bryant to work for MGA while still employed by Mattel and MGA's inducement to Bryant to not disclose his 
inventions to Mattel. 4AAC ¶ 161. Bryant couldn't have ""breached"" the clause assigning his works to Mattel, since the 
assignment was automatic; indeed, the immediacy of the assignment is the foundation for Mattel's interpretation of the 
Inventions Agreement. "
2139,34," Section 1125 provides that: The owner of a famous mark shall be entitled, subject to the principles of equity and upon such terms as the court deems 
reasonable, [*209]  to an injunction against another person's commercial use in commerce of a mark or trade name, if such 
use begins after the mark has become famous and causes dilution of the distinctive quality of the mark, and to obtain such 
other relief as is provided in this subsection."
2139,15, U.S.C. § 1125(c)(1). 
2144,35," Contrary to Mattel's argument, the principle discussed in Massey — that an amended pleading washes away prior pleadings 
— makes no sense if limited to new and unmentioned affirmative defenses, especially where, as here, the amended pleading 
significantly alters the scope of the case. "
2146,36, Mattel does not specifically allege these injuries in its pleading. 
2148,37," These Ninth Circuit cases could be read to hold that there's no property interest in honest services to begin with, however, 
such an interpretation would appear to run afoul of the federal honest services fraud statute. "
2149,38, This citation to Holmes was erroneously omitted from the courtesy copy distributed to counsel. 
2154,39," Mattel has no evidence that Trueba's emails to Machado are ""communications in interstate or foreign commerce."" 18 U.S.C. § 
1343. Both Machado and Trueba resided in Mexico City at the time of the emails. In some cases, ""it is possible for a wire 
communication whose origin and ultimate destination are within a single state to be routed through another state"" but Mattel 
does not so establish here. See Ideal Steel Supply Corp. v. Anza, 373 F.3d 251, 265 (2d Cir. 2004), rev'd on other grounds, 547 
U.S. 451, 126 S.Ct. 1991, 164 L. Ed. 2d 720 (2006). Mattel's theory would require a fact-finder to conclude that Trueba's emails 
to Machado were routed into the United States and then back to Mexico. "
2155,40," There isn't a consensus on whether future revenues, even when easily calculable, constitute ""business or property."" See Hemi 
Group, 130 S.Ct. at 988 (""[We] do not decide whether the City's allegations of lost tax revenue constitute an injury to its 
'business or property.'""). "
2156,41," Mattel argues that ""Hasbro is not the plaintiff here; Mattel, the direct victim of the alleged wrongdoing, is."" Mattel Opp'n to MGA 
MSJ at 95:19-20. This argument conflates the different injuries suffered by Mattel, some of which (loss of trade secrets) were 
unique to Mattel and others (loss of profits) were not. Mattel suggests that MGA's deliberate attempts to eat into Mattel's market 
share establishes intent, which would distinguish Mattel's claim from other manufacturers' potential claims. Intent, however, is 
immaterial to RICO's proximate cause inquiry. See Anza, 547 U.S. at 460 (holding that plaintiff cannot ""circumvent the proximate 
cause requirement simply by claiming that the defendant's aim was to increase market share at a competitor's expense""). "
2160,42," Mattel's request to add Cabrera, Morales and Salazar as members is denied. "
2170,1, BPWCP and ARCO are referred to collectively as defendants. 
2172,2," The third cause of action asserted 13 different allegedly unfair business practices. All but the three discussed here have been 
abandoned on appeal."
2172,3," Defendants also filed a motion for summary adjudication on the first and second causes of action, but plaintiffs' subsequent 
dismissal of those causes of action rendered that motion moot. "
2180,4," Defendant presented the deposition testimony of Lee Greville, who explained that tobacco companies provide volume rebates 
to retailers at the point of sale. For this reason tobacco companies generally require retailers to purchase cigarettes from 
wholesalers rather than other retailers; otherwise, two different retailers would receive a rebate from the sale of the same pack of 
cigarettes."
2180,5," Corporations Code section 31101, subdivision (c)(2) provides in relevant  [*32] part: ""In the case of a material modification of 
an existing franchise, the franchisor discloses in writing to each franchisee information concerning the specific sections of the 
franchise agreement proposed to be modified and such additional information as may be required by rule or order of the 
commissioner. Any agreement by such franchisee to such material modifications shall not be binding upon the franchisee if the 
franchisee, within 10 business days after the receipt of such writing identifying the material modification, notifies the franchisor in 
writing that the agreement to such modification is rescinded."""
2180,6," As noted earlier, the PMPA Agreement states: ""BPWCP reserves the right to provide ARCO branded motor fuels solely through 
an automatic gasoline ordering and delivery system and to not accept individual orders placed by franchisee."" "
2185,1," Prior to MedImmune I, 549 U.S. at 132 n.11, the Federal Circuit applied a two-part test to determine the existence of 
declaratory judgment jurisdiction; the test required both: (1) an explicit threat or other action by the patentee, which creates a 
reasonable apprehension on the part of the declaratory plaintiff that it will face an infringement suit; and (2) present activity which 
could constitute infringement or concrete steps taken with the intent to conduct such activity. Super Sack, 57 F.3d at 1058 
(citation omitted). The Federal Circuit has now recognized that the ""Supreme Court's opinion in MedImmune [I] represents a 
rejection of [its] reasonable apprehension of suit test."" SanDisk Corp. v. STMicroelectronics, Inc., 480 F.3d 1372, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 
2007). The ""all the circumstances"" test applied in MedImmune I represents a ""more lenient legal standard [that] facilitates or 
enhances the availability of declaratory judgment jurisdiction in patent cases."" Micron Tech., Inc. v. Mosaid Techs., Inc., 518 
F.3d 897, 902 (Fed. Cir. 2008)  [*12] (citations omitted)."
2185,2," ""An error doesn't become a mistake until you  [*13] refuse to correct it."" PAUL H. KING & RICHARD C. FRIES, DESIGN OF BIOMEDICAL 
DEVICES AND SYSTEMS 441 (2003) (quoting Orlando A. Battista). "
2186,3," The first covenant provides that Defendant will not sue Plaintiff for infringement ""now or in the future (including for any possible 
past damages, if any) for any products that [Plaintiff] currently makes, uses, sells, offers for sale, or imports into the United 
States."" (Def.'s MFR 2:20-23.) The second covenant states that Defendant will not sue any of Plaintiff's customers for 
infringement ""now or in the future (including for any possible past damages, if any) for any products that [Plaintiff] currently 
makes (or made in the past), and which were purchased, used, offered for sale, imported, or resold by any customers of 
[Plaintiff] to any other person."" (Id. at 2:22-25.)"
2186,4," The Court fully acknowledges the potential unfairness of the Federal Circuit precedent, which binds this Court. If the facts 
alleged by Plaintiff are true, Defendant attempted ""extra-judicial patent enforcement with scare-the-consumer [and competitor]-
and-run tactics that infect[ed] the competitive environment of the business community with uncertainty and insecurity."" 
Arrowhead Indus. Water, Inc. v. Ecolochem, Inc., 846 F.2d 731, 735 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (citation omitted), overruled on other "
2187,," grounds by MedImmune I, 549 U.S. at 118. An important purpose behind the Declaratory Judgment Act is to prevent patent 
holders from threatening enforcement while avoiding litigation that might render the patent invalid or unenforceable. See id.; see 
also Cardinal Chem. Co. v. Morton Int'l, Inc., 508 U.S. 83, 100, 113 S. Ct. 1967, 124 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1993) (The Supreme 
 [*19] Court ""emphasized the importance to the public at large of resolving questions of patent validity . . . .""); Dow Jones & Co. 
v. Ablaise, Ltd. (Ablaise I), 583 F. Supp. 2d 41, 44 (D.D.C. 2008) (""There is an important public interest in protecting the legal 
system against manipulation by parties, especially those prone to involvement in repeat litigation, who might contrive to moot 
cases that otherwise would be likely to produce unfavorable precedents."") (citing HART & WESCHLER, THE FEDERAL COURTS AND THE FEDERAL SYSTEM 204 (5th ed. 2003)), rev'd in part, Ablaise II, 606 F.3d at 1348-49. Thus, Defendant's covenants not to sue 
are likely ""manipulative efforts to defeat declaratory jurisdiction . . . "" and thwart that very important goal. See Benitec, 495 F.3d 
at 1351 (Dyk, J., dissenting). Perhaps a different test for determining whether there is a case or controversy should apply when 
the allegation of infringement is withdrawn during the course of litigation, like the case at hand. See id. at 1350. Such policy 
questions, however, are better left for the Federal Circuit and Congress. The Court, as a district court, is duty bound to apply 
Federal Circuit precedent with fidelity. See Ablaise II, 606 F.3d at 1348  [*20] (""Subject matter jurisdiction is a threshold 
requirement for a court's power to exercise jurisdiction over a case, and no amount of 'prudential reasons' or perceived 
increases in efficiency, however sound, can empower a federal court to hear a case where there is no extant case or 
controversy.""). "
2188,5," Defendant's voluntary covenants not to sue do not have the necessary judicial sanctioned imprimatur for Plaintiff to be a 
""prevailing"" party for the infringement claim. In Highway Equipment Co. v. FECO, Ltd., 469 F.3d at 1032, the Federal Circuit held 
that a voluntary motion to dismiss by a defendant based on a covenant not to sue and a district court's subsequent dismissal of 
claims with prejudice permit a ""district court [to] properly entertain . . . [a] fee claim under 35 U.S.C. § 285."" That, however, is not 
the case before the Court. Defendant never asserted an infringement claim or counterclaim. It also did not file a motion to 
dismiss upon which the Court could grant. Indeed, the Federal Circuit has yet to determine whether a declaratory judgment 
defendant's grant of a covenant not to sue qualifies as a ""judicially sanctioned change in the legal relationships"" if no 
infringement claims  [*26] or counterclaims were ever first made against the declaratory judgment plaintiff. Several district courts 
have held that, in such a scenario, a court does not have the authority to hear an attorney fees claim. Jacobsen, 609 F. Supp. 2d 
at 931 (""Because, as the patent at issue was voluntarily disclaimed, the Court cannot find that [plaintiff] is the prevailing party in 
this matter. Therefore, attorneys' fees under section 285 could not become available to [plaintiff] and does not, in any case, form 
an independent basis for jurisdiction over the now-disclaimed patent.""); see also King Pharms. II, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 102740, 
2010 WL 3924685, at *5 (same)."
2188,6," Defendant could divest the Court of jurisdiction over attorney fees if it offered to pay the entire amount of attorney fees in 
dispute, thereby mooting the § 285 issue. Samsung Elecs. Co. v. Rambus, Inc., 523 F.3d 1374, 1379-80 (Fed. Cir. 2008). "
2190,7," In its Motion to Dismiss, Defendant took a quote from Cygnus out of context; the quote reads, ""[i]t is enough to simply point out 
that the same facts that compel the conclusion that [the plaintiff] failed to establish declaratory judgment jurisdiction for the 
district court also compel the conclusion that no reasonable fact finder could find that [the defendant] has acted to enforce [its] 
patents."" (Def.'s MTD 8:14-18); Cygnus, 92 F.3d at 1162. Contrary to Defendant's assertion, this quote does not mean that 
""once the Court dismisses the declaratory judgment claims, it [must] also dismiss [the] antitrust claim."" (Def.'s MTD 8:12-13.) 
Rather, the Federal Circuit was merely restating its prior holding that the standard to determine declaratory judgment jurisdiction 
is the same as the standard to determine whether a plaintiff has properly pled  [*34] the enforcement element of a Walker 
Process claim. See Unitherm Food, 375 F.3d at 1358."
2190,8," Not to belabor the point, the Court notes that the Hydril district court asserted subject matter jurisdiction over the Walker 
Process claim even though the plaintiff had not asserted a declaratory judgment claim. See Hydril, 474 F.3d at 1345. By 
Defendant's logic, a Walker Process claim could not have stood alone in Hydril because the court's jurisdiction should have 
depended on a pendent declaratory judgment claim. That was not the case in Hydril and that cannot be the case here. Both the 
district court and the  [*36] Federal Circuit in Hydril reviewed the necessary ""enforcement"" element of a Walker Process claim as 
a Rule 12(b)(6) issue, not a subject matter jurisdiction issue. See id. "
2191,9," In a PTO reissue proceeding, ""new claims that broaden, narrow, or otherwise alter the scope of the original patent"" are 
permissible, if conducted within two years of the issuance of the original patent. Rolls-Royce PLC v. United Techs. Corp., 730 F. 
Supp. 2d 489, 2009 WL 6750627, at *1 n.2 (E.D. Va. 2009) (citing 35 U.S.C. § 251)."
2191,10," The Court construes Plaintiff's renewed request to deny Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Claims One, Two, and Three as 
consent that the claims of the '723 Patent are identical to Claims 1 through 16 of the '945 Reissued Patent. (See Notice of 
Reissue Patent 2:16-18.) Were the claims of the '723 Patent to be substantively different, Plaintiff's  [*40] claims for declaratory 
judgment of invalidity and unenforceability would be moot because Plaintiff could not be liable for any infringement prior to the 
date of the reissue patent. See Seattle Box Co., 731 F.2d at 827. "
2195,1," Since the facts Montana Camo cites in support of its UTPA claim bear no relation to the allegations in the Amended Complaint, 
Cabela's argues the Court should reject the UTPA cause of action outright because courts need not address claims  [*4] first 
raised on a motion for summary judgment, citing Hancock v. Potter, 531 F.3d 474, 480 (7th Cir. 2008). Regardless, while the 
claims alleged in the complaint bear no resemblance to the current allegations, Cabela's has long been on notice of these 
allegations (see Doc. 59) and the Court prefers to address them on their merits. "
2196,2," These patterns are the  [*6] only patterns relevant to this motion. Throughout this Order, where there is a reference to Montana 
Camo products or garments, it means lightweight garments, such as 7-button shirts or 6-pocket pants made from Prairie Ghost 
Ultimate or River Ghost fabric."
2196,3," Montana Camo's Statement of Undisputed Facts (""MCSUF"") states that ""sometime near the end of 2005, Cabela's learned that 
Montana Camo established a wholesale/vendor relationship with Cabela's primary competitor, Bass Pro."" ¶ 53. The deposition 
 [*10] testimony that Montana Camo cites in support of this undisputed fact, however, requires some significant inferences "
2197,," before this fact can be established. Depo. Ev Tarrell, 19:1 - 20:21 (May 26, 2010). Regardless, Cabela's does not dispute that it 
was upset that Bass Pro Shops was selling the same products for less or that this issue was one of the reasons it discontinued 
its relationship with Montana Camo. Cabela's, however, does dispute that the Bass Pro Shops issue was the sole reason it 
ceased business with Montana Camo."
2197,4," Cabela's continued to purchase some finished products, such as hats and t-shirts, from Montana Camo in 2006. "
2199,5," For example, while Montana Camo loosely defines the relevant market as the ""western camouflage market,"" it makes no 
attempt at proving a substantially adverse effect on competition in the western camouflage market through either an increase in 
prices, a decrease in the quantity of suppliers, or a decrease in the quality of the product. See Bizzle, at * 15. "
2204,1, The NAR is not a party to this litigation. 
2205,2," Although the Counts are labeled ""Count I"" through ""Count VII,"" there is no Count IV. The Court will refer to the Counts as they 
are labeled in the complaint. "
2206,3," HN8[
] A Section One claim may also be analyzed under the per se rule in that the challenged conduct has such pernicious 
anticompetitive effect, it is considered a per se violation of the Sherman Act,  [**11] such as horizontal price fixing among 
competitors or group boycotts. See Jacobs, 2010 U.S. App. LEXIS 24638, 2010 WL 4880864, at *2. Plaintiff has not alleged a 
per se category of trade restraint; thus, this Court will apply the rule of reason to determine whether the alleged restraint 
unreasonably limits competition. "
2211,1, The unopposed Request for Judicial Notice is granted. (ECF No. 5-4). 
2223,1," The Complaint erroneously refers to ""§ 1985(c)"" as opposed to ""§ 1985(3)."" Compl. at 25. Plaintiff acknowledges this obvious 
error in her opposition brief. Pl.'s Opp'n at 7. "
2225,2," Section 1 of the Sherman Act provides, in relevant part, that, ""Every person who shall make any contract or engage in any 
combination or conspiracy hereby declared to be illegal shall be deemed guilty of a felony...."" 15 U.S.C. § 1. "
2226,3," Plaintiff's bare assertion that there is no state action requirement under the Fourteenth Amendment is both unsupported and 
misstates the law. Pl.'s Opp'n at 10-11. That aside, her vague and conclusory allegations of a conspiracy are plainly insufficient 
to state a claim. See Karim-Panahi v. Los Angeles Police Dept., 839 F.2d 621, 626 (9th Cir. 1988) (""A claim  [*22] under [section 
1985] must allege facts to support the allegation that defendants conspired together. A mere allegation of conspiracy without 
factual specificity is insufficient.""). Other than Plaintiff's allegation that Dr. Geissberger referred to the quality of her dental work 
as ""Third World Dentistry,"" there are no facts alleged that establish, or from which it can be inferred, that there was ""an 
agreement or meeting of the minds"" by the Individual Defendants to deprive Plaintiff of her right to equal protection. See Franklin 
v. Fox, 312 F.3d 423, 441 (9th Cir. 2002). "
2228,4," The entirely speculative nature of her defamation claim is underscored by Plaintiff in her her opposition, wherein she argues as 
follow: ""Provided that Registrar Defendant BENDER did not take it upon himself to invent the grades Plaintiff received in those 
courses after Winter quarter, or to change them unilaterally, it is possible or even likely that Defendants GEISSBERGER, 
LABARRE, and GIUSTI published to [Bender] that Plaintiff either failed or did not take those courses."" Pl.'s Opp'n at 18. "
2229,5," In their moving papers, Defendants argued  [*35] that a claim for the negligent provision of educational services is not 
actionable under California law. In her opposition, Plaintiff responded that such rule applied only to public, not private, 
educational institutions, Defendants fail to respond to this purported distinction in their reply, and instead, propose that Plaintiff 
amend her complaint to direct her negligence claim against the University only. It thus appears that Defendants have abandoned 
the argument presented in their moving papers. "
2234,1," Arbitron Inc. was, until 1993, a competitor of Nielsen's in the television viewership ratings business, and is currently the 
dominant provider of radio ratings in the United States."
2234,2," Sampling involves selecting a small subset of the population intended to be representative of the population at large, and 
extrapolating generalized population-wide information from the behavior or preferences of the sample. The degree of error in any 
sampling is the extent to which the sample does not adequately  [**5] represent the population at large. Obviously, measuring 
the behavior or preferences of a sample is never as accurate as taking the same measurements of each member of the 
population at large. "
2235,3," HN2[
] The federal and state antitrust claims are analyzed together, because ""[t]he facts underlying the state and federal 
antitrust claims are the same, and Florida's antitrust statutes are very similar to the federal statutes."" AvMed, Inc. v. Sheridan 
Healthcorp, Inc., No. 09-CIV-23851 (PCH), 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 75953, 2010 WL 3008811, *7 (S.D. Fla. July 28, 2010). "
2236,4," Were it as Nielsen contends, one might expect ""staggered renewals"" to appear as a ""contract strategy"" to ""reduce 
administrative burden,"" rather than to win and retain clients. "
2241,5," In fact, Sunbeam does not appear to be displeased with the Local People Meter ratings it has received from Nielsen for its 
Boston television station. "
2242,6," Although the Second Amended Complaint alleged additional excluded competitors—including Taylor Nelson Sofres, SRI, and 
Rentrak—Sunbeam has abandoned these on summary judgment."
2242,7," Cable boxes provide information on broadcast viewership to the extent that customers watch broadcast channels via their cable 
subscription, rather than receiving the broadcast signal by antenna. However, such data is significantly incomplete, as it does 
not account for those viewers that do not receive television through cable, a distinct demographic group constituting as much as 
30% of the national television market. See Dep. of Sara Erichson, Ex. 128, at 129:7-130:12. In this regard, though the parties "
2243,," have not addressed the issue, the Court questions whether erinMedia's product is similar enough to Nielsen's—which measures 
total viewership—to qualify as a relevant competing product. "
2245,8," Ironically, Frank Maggio of erinMedia, which figures so prominently in Sunbeam's discussion of excluded competitors, testified 
that it was cable television stations' viewership, not broadcast stations' viewership (including WSVN's), which was underrated by 
Nielsen's methodology, and that erinMedia's methodology would properly reallocate a greater viewership percentage to the 
cable stations. See Dep. of Frank Maggio, Ex. 37, at 35:10-16."
2245,9," Even if Sunbeam establishes a jury issue regarding alleged misrepresentations surrounding implementation of the Local 
People Meters—a matter which must await supplemental briefing—its antitrust claim would fail for lack of a ""willing and able 
competitor,"" and even if its claim did not so fail, its antitrust injury would still be limited to supracompetitive prices, for Sunbeam 
would face the same constraints here outlined in establishing any other form of damage. "
