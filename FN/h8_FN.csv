27,1," As discussed below, Plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint after their cases were transferred to this court by the United States 
Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation."
27,2," Plaintiffs did not all sign identical agreements, but the agreements are similar in relevant respects, as described herein. The 
agreements are attached as Group Exhibit A to Plaintiffs' Consolidated Amended Complaint. (Dkt. 41.) Several Plaintiffs signed 
agreements with Chase Manhattan, Bank One, and Washington Mutual, which have since been acquired by or merged with J.P. 
Morgan to become JPMorgan Chase. Some Plaintiffs signed their agreements with JPMorgan Chase  [**7] itself."
27,3," Each agreement contains similar language regarding when Defendant is permitted to reduce or suspend the amount of a 
HELOC. "
28,4," Washington Mutual's letter explained that ""[w]ith home values continuing to fall in many parts of the country, a recent review of 
your account identified a decline in the value of the property securing your HELOC since the date you applied for your HELOC or 
increase."" (Group Ex. B at 10.) Chase's letter similarly explained that, ""[w]ith home values falling in many parts of the country, 
we've used a proven valuation method to estimate your home's value . . . ."" (Group Ex. B at 8.) "
31,5," For purposes of this opinion, the court uses the term ""present available equity"" to refer to the amount of unencumbered equity 
in the subject property at the time of the HELOC reduction or suspension. ""Available equity"" refers to the amount of 
unencumbered equity at the time of HELOC origination. The difference between these two figures represents the payments that 
have been made in the interim on the subject property's principal, minus the reduction in value that has occurred (as well as any 
additional liabilities to which the property has become subject, which does not appear to be a factor in this case). "
32,6," The Official Commentary's ""safe harbor"" provision is considered controlling law, absolving a lender from liability for reductions 
that occur based on declines in value within the ""safe harbor""  [**23] parameters. See Hamm v. Ameriquest Mortg. Co., 506 F.3d 
525, 528 (7th Cir. 2007) (""Unless demonstrably irrational, Federal Reserve Board staff opinions construing the Act [TILA] or 
Regulation [Z] should be dispositive."") (citation and quotation omitted). The safe harbor provision reads, in full:"
32,6," . Significant decline defined. What constitutes a significant decline for purposes of § 226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(A) will vary according 
to individual circumstances. In any event, if the value of the dwelling declines such that the initial difference between the 
credit limit and the available equity (based on the property's appraised value for purposes of the plan) is reduced by fifty 
percent, this constitutes a significant decline in the value of the dwelling for purposes of § 226.5b(f)(3)(vi)(A). . . . This 
provision does not require a creditor to obtain an appraisal before suspending credit privileges although a significant decline 
must occur before suspension can occur."

the higher their use of this revolving line of credit, the more it negatively affects their credit score."") (visited June 28, 2011). "
34,8," Defendant has submitted supplemental authority in support of its argument that Plaintiffs' allegations do not state a claim for 
violations of TILA or Regulation Z, and, in particular, that the use of AVMs does not run afoul of those laws. In the cited case, 
however, the plaintiff had not made ""a single allegation anywhere . . . that purports to correct the alleged mistaken property value 
reached by Wells Fargo"". Brigliadora v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., No. 8:10-CV-01944-EAK-TGW, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 60620, 
2011 WL 2217485, at *4 (M.D. Fla. June 7, 2011). In other words, the Brigliadora plaintiff  [**30] did not rebut the valuation that 
was a product of Wells Fargo's use of AVMs. Plaintiffs here, by contrast, have specifically alleged that their property values had 
not suffered declines that can be deemed significant."
34,9," Again, the court notes, Plaintiffs have not presented these circumstances as an independent violation, but because Defendant 
argues as though they have, the court addresses the argument here. "
36,10," The court notes that Plaintiffs' contract claims are governed by the laws of different states. ""[T]he choice-of-law rule  [**38] for 
pendent state claims should be that of the forum [state]."" Baltimore Orioles, Inc. v. Major League Baseball Players Assoc., 805 
F.2d 663, 681 (7th Cir. 1986). In Illinois, ""the law applicable to a contract is that which the parties intended . . . [w]hen that intent 
is expressed."" Hofeld v. Nationwide Life Ins. Co., 59 Ill.2d 522, 529, 322 N.E.2d 454, 458 (1975). The HELOC agreements 
require the use of Minnesota law (Cavanagh, Group Ex. A at 5), California law (Frank, Group Ex. A at 6; Malcolm, Group Ex. A 
at 5; Walsh, Group Ex. A at 6), Delaware law (Hackett, Group Ex. A at 7), Texas law (Mayes, Group Ex. A at 5), and Arizona law 
(Wilder, Group Ex. A at 5). "
38,11," The Washington Mutual agreement entered into by Plaintiff Frank provides an illustrative list. It explains that a HELOC may be 
reduced or suspended if: the property value declines significantly; the bank believes the borrower cannot meet his or her 
obligations; the borrower defaults on his or her obligations; the government prohibits charging the APR specified in the 
agreement; government action affects the priority of the bank's security  [**46] interest in the property; the government informs 
the bank ""that continued advances may constitute an unsafe and unsound business practice""; or the maximum APR has been 
reached. (Group Ex. A at 14.) Defendant explains the reductions or suspensions at issue in this case solely by reference to the 
provision permitting such action where there has been a significant decline in property value; it does not contend that the 
reductions or suspensions are justified by reference to any other enumerated provision. "
39,12," Hackett's agreement explains that You agree to pay us a non-refundable Annual Participation Fee of $25.00 during the Draw Period and any extension of the 
Draw Period. Unless you terminate your Credit Account and pay the outstanding balance, the Annual Participation Fee will 
be charged to your Credit Account annually during the Draw Period in the Monthly Statement Period ending on your 
anniversary month which we assign to your Credit Account. (Group Ex. A at 22.)"
39,13," Plaintiffs do not discuss what state law they believe applies to each Plaintiff's implied covenant claim, but as their claims are 
based on contractual performance, this court applies the same choice-of-law provisions to these claims. See Amakua 
Development LLC v. Warner, 411 F. Supp. 2d 941, 948 (7th Cir. 2006). "
40,14," Plaintiffs do not break out their allegations on this claim by individual Plaintiff, but rather allege generally that the implied 
covenant was breached by Defendant in some or all of these ways as to each Plaintiff. (Compl. ¶¶ 146-62.) "
42,15," See Zupancich v. U.S. Steel Corp, No. 08-5847 ADM/RLE, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44504, 2009 WL 1474772, at *3 (D. Minn. 
May 27, 2009) (""In Minnesota,  [**59] the existence of an express contract between the parties . . . precludes recovery under the 
theories of unjust enrichment and quantum meruit.""); Kuroda v. SPJS Holdings, L.L.C., 971 A.2d 872, 891 (Del. Ch. 2009) (""A 
claim for unjust enrichment is not available if there is a contract that governs the relationship between parties that gives rise to 
the unjust enrichment claim.""); Fortune Production Co. v. Conoco, Inc., 52 S.W.3d 671, 684 (Tex. 2000) (""Generally speaking, 
when a valid, express contract covers the subject matter of the parties' dispute, there can be no recovery under a quasi-contract 
theory.""). "
43,16," The court finds no provision in the HELOC agreements that explicitly addresses the reinstatement process or identifies which 
party is responsible to pay the costs of such a reinstatement, nor have the parties identified such a provision."
43,17," Plaintiffs' complaint does not include detailed information concerning which Plaintiffs paid for appraisals, how much they paid, 
who they paid for the appraisals, whether they received refunds, or the amount of any refunds received. The complaint does 
allege that Cavanagh paid for an appraisal but did not receive full reimbursement  [**64] (Compl. ¶ 39); that Hackett paid $385 
for an appraisal (id. ¶¶ 55, 64); that Malcolm paid $385 for an appraisal, which was not reimbursed (id. ¶ 69); and that Wilder 
paid for an appraisal. (Id. ¶ 101.) "
44,18," Although the Complaint uses slightly different terminology, in the court's view, and for purposes of this motion, a ""false 
statement of material fact"" of the type alleged by Plaintiffs is essentially the same allegation as the ""fraudulent business act"" 
required to state a UCL claim under California law, Cal. Bus & Prof. Code § 17200, a ""deceptive act or practice"" of the type 
required by Illinois law, Oliveira v. Amoco Oil Co., 201 Ill.2d 134, 149, 776 N.E.2d 151, 160, 267 Ill. Dec. 14 (2002), and a ""fraud, 
false pretense, false promise, misrepresentation, misleading statement or deceptive practice,"" as required by Minnesota law, 
Minn. Stat. § 325F.69. "
45,19," The court notes that Plaintiffs have withdrawn claims pursuant to the California UCL on behalf of Wilder because neither he 
nor Defendant are California residents. (Response at 38 n. 18.) "
46,20," For the purposes of the statute, ""merchandise"" includes loans. Minn. Stat. § 325F.68, subdivision 2. "
50,1," The parties do not dispute that Wells Fargo has adequately demonstrated that the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000."
50,2," Notably, this is a different argument than that presented in the Notice of Removal (#1). In that filing, Wells Fargo argued that 
the citizenship of the Plaintiff was Colorado based solely on CCRC's status as an agency the State of Colorado. See Sturdevant 
v. Paulsen, 218 F.3d 1160, 1164 (10th Cir. 2000) (citing Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. Of Educ. V. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 280, 97 
S. Ct. 568, 50 L. Ed. 2d 471 (1977))  [*3] (addressing the arm-of-the-state analysis). Regardless of the theory on which Wells 
Fargo proceeds, however, it retains the burden of demonstrating facts sufficient to support subject matter jurisdiction in this 
Court. See Martin v. Franklin Capital Corp., 251 F.3d 1284, 1289-90 (10th Cir. 2001)."
50,3," Discrimination in housing practices, including the provision of financing, based on marital status is unlawful under Colorado law. 
See Colo. Rev. Stat. § 24-34-502."
50,4," Claim One asserts unlawful discrimination in the terms, conditions, privileges/facilities, and services for Wells Fargo's alleged 
use of different qualification criteria for Ms. Moores and refusal to negotiate with her regarding  [*6] the terms of the refinance 
loan. Claim Two asserts unlawful discrimination in the provision of housing based on Wells Fargo's requirement that Ms. Moores' 
husband sign the loan documents as a non-borrowing spouse. Claim Three asserts unlawful discrimination in a residential real 
estate transaction by subjecting Ms. Moores to stricter borrowing standards due to her marital status and requiring her non-
borrowing spouse to sign the mortgage loan documents. "
51,5," Federal jurisdiction in cases brought by a State against a citizen of another State is granted by 28 U.S.C. § 1251(b)(3) which 
establishes original but not exclusive jurisdiction over such actions by the United States Supreme Court. "
52,6," States or state agencies generally participate as parties in lawsuits in four capacities: (i) to pursue the State's sovereign 
interests, which include the exercise of sovereign power (i.e., making and enforcing laws within the State) and interactions with 
other States; (ii) in support of a proprietary interest, in which the State is essentially acting as a private party; (iii) to pursue the 
interests of a particular private party, in which the State is merely a nominal party; and (iv) in its capacity of parens patriae, 
 [*10] literally parent of the country. See Alfred L. Snapp & Son, Inc. v. Puerto Rico, 458 U.S. 592, 601-602, 102 S. Ct. 3260, 73 
L. Ed. 2d 995 (1982)."
52,7," See e.g., Lowery v. Alabama Power Co., 483 F.3d 1184, 1193 n.24 (11th Cir. 2007). "
53,8," See,e.g.,  [*15] Colo. Rev. Stat. § 24-34-508 (providing for actual damages, civil penalties, cease and desist orders, and 
affirmative action requiring compliance for violations of Colorado's Unfair Housing Practices laws). "
54,9," It is of no significance to this analysis that Ms. Moores may benefit from this action or might also be considered a real party in 
interest. The absence of citizenship status for Colorado precludes a finding of complete diversity among the parties. See, e.g., 
Hood v. AstraZeneca Pharms. LP, 744 F.Supp.2d 590, 596 (N.D. Miss. 2010); Hoffman-La Roche, 639 F.Supp.2d at 33-34; 
Microsoft Corp., 428 F.Supp.2d at 546. "
61,1," The Court notes that Defendant also urges the application of the rule of reason on the grounds that the UMAP policy governs 
the advertised price rather than the resale price of Defendant's products. (Def.'s Mem. 11-12.) Whether an internet storefront 
ultimately collapses that distinction is certainly an interesting question. But because the Court finds that the rule of reason 
applies even to resale price restraints under Leegin, the issue of advertised versus resale pricing is beyond the scope of this 
ruling. "
85,1," AUO initially filed its answer in the consolidated MDL case, No. 07-1827 but failed to file it in the individual case, No. 09-5609. 
AUO then filed a stipulation that allowed AUO to file the answer in the individual case nunc pro tunc to August 27, 2010. Doc. 68. 
The Court signed an order accordingly. Doc. 73. "
88,2," During oral argument, the parties discussed two cases extensively: In re Currency Conversion Fee Litigation, 265 F. Supp. 2d 
385 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) and Bischoff v. DirecTV, Inc., 180 F. Supp. 2d 1097 (C.D. Cal. 2002), both of which were cited in AUO's 
reply. While it is true that the precise factual allegations of these cases differ from those currently before the Court, their holdings 
are consistent with this decision. Currency Conversion addressed credit cardholder allegations that credit card networks and 
banks had conspired to artificially raise the fees for foreign currency conversions performed by credit card companies. 265 F. "
89,," Supp. 2d at 396-96. Bischoff addressed customer allegations that DirecTV had conspired with other companies to create a 
monopoly over the ""distribution and sale of high-power direct satellite service and equipment."" 180 F. Supp. 2d at 1102. Both 
 [*37] cases dealt with the arbitrability of antitrust claims based on the wording of an arbitration clause; both held that, where the 
parties signed a broadly worded arbitration agreement, the presumption in favor of arbitration compelled a finding that the 
antitrust claims were arbitrable. See, e.g. Currency Conversion, 265 F. Supp. 2d at 410 (""In contrast, the arbitration clauses at 
issue here are quite broad in that they apply to any claim 'arising from or relating in any way to . . . your Account' and 'arising out 
of or relating to . . . your Account.' . . . [A]fter applying the strong policy in favor of arbitration . . . it is clear that plaintiffs' antitrust 
claims 'touch matters' covered by [the agreements]."") (contrasting the arbitration clause before the court with the clause at issue 
in Coors Brewing Co. v. Molson Breweries, 51 F.3d 1511 (10th Cir. 1995) in which the Tenth Circuit held that language referring 
specifically to ""the implementation, interpretation, and enforcement of the contract"" was not broad enough to cover the parties' 
antitrust dispute); see also Bischoff, 180 F. Supp. 2d at 1106 (""Plaintiffs contend that their claims in this case do not relate to 
non-performance  [*38] by DirecTV under the parties' contract, but rather, relate to DirecTV's illegal conspiracies with other 
parties in an effort to violate anti-trust laws. . . Plaintiffs allege that they have paid higher prices for services and equipment than 
they otherwise would have but for DirecTV's alleged anti-competitive acts. These allegations center around DirecTV's services, 
disputes which clearly fall within the scope of the arbitration clause.""). "

101,11," The Defendants have alternatively argued that the complaint does not satisfy the pleading requirement of either Rule 8 or Rule 
9(b)."
101,12," Parenthetically, this Court will note, however, that HN11[
] it appears that Rule 9(b) does apply to the allegations of false attestation which are part of the claims under §§ 1546(b)(1), (2) and (3). The pleading standard of Rule 9(b)  [**16] applies to ""all 
averments of fraud."" Hershey v. MNC Fin., Inc., 774 F. Supp. 367, 376 (D. Md. 1991). This Court recently found that when the 
alleged racketeering sounds in fraud, plaintiffs asserting RICO claims must meet the pleading standard of Rule 9(b). Kun Lee v. 
PMG 1001, LLC, No. RDB-09-1514, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2103, 2010 WL 14823 at *3 (D. Md. January 11, 2010). Plaintiffs' 
claims of ""false attestation"" under §1546 sound in fraud and therefore should meet the Rule 9(b) pleading standard. "
103,13," Two legally and factually analogous cases against poultry processors, Trollinger v. Tyson Foods, 543 F. Supp. 2d 842 (E.D. 
Tenn. 2008) and Hall v. Thomas, 753 F. Supp. 2d 1113 (N.D. Ala. 2010), were found to be without merit and were decided for 
the defendants on summary judgment. While these cases did survive motions to dismiss, both cases were filed pre-Iqbal and 
therefore are of limited value in analyzing the legal sufficiency of the pleading in the instant case. Both Trollinger and Hall are 
nevertheless indicative of the lack of factual backing characterizing this particular strain of civil RICO cases based on alleged 
use of illegal immigrant labor. In both cases, defendants were subjected to a lengthy discovery process for identical allegations."
103,14," Williams v. Mohawk Indus., Inc., 314 F. Supp. 2d 1333 (N.D. Ga. 2004), aff'd in part, rev'd in part on other grounds by 465 
F.3d 1277 (11th Cir. 2006). "
104,15," In ePlus, the plaintiff brought a civil conspiracy claim under state law and RICO § 1962(d). The court noted the general 
applicability of the intracorporate conspiracy doctrine, but found that the case fell under the independent personal stake 
exception. As a result, the court did not specifically note whether it considered the intracorporate conspiracy doctrine in relation 
to the state law claim, the RICO claim, or both. ePlus, 313 F.3d at 179."
104,16," At the hearing held by this Court on June 9, 2011, Plaintiffs explained that the alleged scheme aimed to increase Perdue's 
overall profitability. Plaintiffs alleged that greater profits would, in turn, benefit the Defendants in the form of higher wages and 
bonuses for ""keeping labor costs low."" Plaintiffs provided no facts supporting the conclusion that Defendants would, in fact, 
receive greater compensation from their alleged activities. Cf. ePlus, 313 F.3d at 179-80 (holding that the independent personal 
stake exception applied when a conspirator's aim was to profit by sending her employer into bankruptcy). Defendants, therefore, 
have no independent personal stake in the alleged scheme. "
112,1," The redacted version of the Third Amended Complaint is referenced in this order, unless otherwise noted. "
116,2," Defendants argue that ""other than sheer speculation, it is not clear what basis Plaintiff could possibly have to allege that these 
meetings had anything to do with an alleged Market Allocation Agreement."" (Doc. 272, Joint Brief p.9 n.6.) Defendants further 
argue that ""the allegations are also false in fact."" Id. The Court is not here concerned the falsity or speculation as to what 
occurred at the meetings. These are issues of proof for a different stage of proceeding. Here, the Court determines whether the 
plaintiff has sufficiently stated an agreement. Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556 (""it simply calls for enough fact to raise a reasonable 
expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of illegal agreement"")."
116,3," Generally, an agreement among competitors to allocate territory is a per se violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. Palmer v. 
BRG of Georgia, 498 U.S. 46, 111 S.Ct. 401, 112 L.Ed.2d 349 (1990) (per curiam). For instance, in Palmer, plaintiffs were 
students who sued providers of bar review courses, BRG and HBJ. Plaintiffs contended that the price of BRG's course was 
enhanced by an unlawful market allocation agreement. BRG had entered into an agreement whereby HBJ agreed to turn its 
Georgia bar review operations over to BRG and to grant BRG an exclusive license to market bar review courses under HBJ's 
""BarBri"" trade name. Id. at 47, 111 S.Ct. 401. The Supreme Court reversed denials of summary judgment by both the trial and 
appeals court, and found the agreement per se unlawful. The Court held that: Here, HBJ and BRG had previously competed in the Georgia market; under their allocation agreement, BRG received that 
market, while HBJ received the remainder of the United States. Each agreed not to compete in the other's territories. Such 
agreements are anticompetitive regardless of whether  [*19] the parties split a market within which both do business or 
whether they merely reserve one market for one and another for the other. Thus, the 1980 agreement between HBJ and 
BRG was unlawful on its face. Id. at 49-50, 111 S.Ct. 401. In Palmer, plaintiff has presented evidence of an agreement called a ""covenant not to compete"" in 
Georgia and a separate reciprocal agreement for non-competition in the rest of the United States. The court said that these 
agreements were formed for the purpose and the effect of raising prices for bar review courses. Pursuant to Palmer, such an 
agreement to allocate the market is illegal under Section 1. "
119,4," Defendants argue that plaintiff's own  [*27] allegations acknowledge other competitors because plaintiff refers to Mittal as a 
""giant"" in steel manufacturing. Plaintiff argues that Mittal is a ""giant,"" but not in the Western United States which is the relevant 
market in this case. This argument is addressed infra regarding contradictory allegations."
119,5," It remains to be proved whether U.S. Steel actually left the Western U.S. in 2006, as currently alleged, or much earlier in 1986, 
as previously alleged. This fact appears to be a linchpin in the Market Allocation Agreement. "
122,6," The TAC alleges, ""Pursuant to the Market Allocation Agreement, U.S. Steel (acting directly and through its alter ego Pitcal) 
agreed to exit the Relevant Market by no longer competing in the Western United States. . . .) (Doc. 268  [*39] TAC ¶74.) 
Plaintiff alleges that U.S. Steel entered into the Market Allocation Agreement with the specific intent to destroy the actual 
competition U.S. Steel provided in the Relevant Market . . ."" (Doc. 268, TAC ¶75; see also ¶¶76-78 (allegations re POSCO and 
UPI).) The TAC does not allege other competition was impacted."
122,7," In evaluating the allegations of competitors in the market, the Court does not ignore plaintiff's prior, inconsistent allegation. 
Plaintiff previously alleged that U.S. Steel exited the Western United States market in 1986 when UPI was formed as a joint 
venture between U.S. Steel and POSCO. Plaintiff had alleged U.S. Steel exited in 1986 because it would not compete against its 
joint venture. See Doc. 216, FAC ¶70-72. In the TAC, plaintiff alleges U.S. Steel exited the market much later, in 2006. In light of 
the inconsistent allegation of facts which are easily verifiable and verifiable without the need for discovery, this particular 
allegation is highly implausible. "
123,8," The section 1 claim, conspiracy to restrain trade, is not fatally flawed even though it contains the same allegations  [*42] of 
delay in increasing prices. Proof is different for a Section 1 and a Section 2 claim. To prove a Section 2 conspiracy to 
monopolize, one must show a specific intent to monopolize. By comparison, a case brought under § 1 of the Sherman Act only 
requires proof of an anticompetitive agreement. "
129,1," Gravois and Gravois Agency filed a separate exception from State Farm and England. However, the substance of the 
exceptions and the arguments made in this appeal are substantially similar. "
140,1," That section provides, in relevant part: HN1[
] ""Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in 
restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal."" "
143,2," Several retired professional football players brought a similar but separate action on March 28, 2011, also seeking a 
preliminary injunction. The district court consolidated the two actions, and denied the retired players' motion for a preliminary 
injunction as moot after issuing an injunction in the previously filed action. "
148,3," Section 5 provides that ""[n]o court of the United States shall have jurisdiction to issue a restraining order or temporary or 
permanent injunction upon the ground that any of the persons participating or interested in a labor dispute constitute or are 
engaged in an unlawful combination or conspiracy because of the doing in concert of the acts enumerated in section 104 of this 
title."" 29 U.S.C. § 105. "
149,4," The Sixth Circuit reached the opposite conclusion, holding that § 4(a) of the NLGA prohibits an injunction in a § 301 action 
requiring an employer to reinstate an employee who was discharged in violation of a collective bargaining agreement. Heheman 
v. E.W. Scripps Co., 661 F.2d 1115, 1124-25 (6th Cir. 1981). This court has cited De Arroyo for the general proposition that a 
court has discretion to award equitable relief by way of reinstatement in a § 301 action, Tatum v. Frisco Transp. Co., 626 F.2d 
55, 60 (8th Cir. 1980); Butler v. Local Union 823, Int'l Bhd. of Teamsters, 514 F.2d 442, 455 (8th Cir. 1975), but has not 
discussed § 4(a) of the NLGA in that context."
149,5," The Players also rely on Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers v. Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Co., 310 F.2d 513 (7th Cir. 1962), 
which held that the NLGA did not deprive a district court of power to grant an injunction that prohibited railroad carriers from 
putting into effect revisions in work rules in a dispute governed by the Railway Labor Act. The court reasoned that ""the purpose 
of Congress"" in enacting the NLGA ""was to protect only employees and unions,"" and found ""nothing in the statement of policy to 
indicate any intention to deny jurisdiction to issue injunctions against employers."" Id. at 518. To the extent that the Seventh 
Circuit would apply this broad reasoning outside the context of the Railway Labor Act, but cf. Chi. Midtown Milk Distribs., Inc. v. 
Dean Foods Co., Nos. 18577, 18578, 1970 U.S. App. LEXIS 8256, 1970 WL 2761, at *1 (7th Cir. July 9, 1970) (per curiam), it is 
inconsistent with this court's precedent that § 4  [**43] applies to injunctions against employers, Bridgestone/Firestone, 61 F.3d "
150,," at 1352, 1355, and with the Players' acknowledgment that an injunction against an employer lockout in a labor dispute must 
conform to § 7 of the NLGA. Appellees' Br. at 43 n.3. "
152,6," The First Circuit in De Arroyo said that the employer's interpretation of § 4(a) in that case ""completely disregard[ed] the primary 
purpose behind the anti-injunction  [**52] provisions,"" 425 F.2d at 290-91, but that case did not involve a lockout, and the court 
observed in the same discussion that ""the reemployment of improperly discharged employees can hardly be said to be one of 
the abuses sought to be eliminated by the Norris-LaGuardia Act."" Id. at 291. See also Lumber & Sawmill Workers, 663 F.2d at 
986-87 (discussing policy reasons that favor according federal courts power to order reinstatement of employees discharged in 
violation of collective bargaining agreements)."
152,7," The Players argue that the Senate's rejection of an amendment that would have included ""employers"" in the policy statement of 
§ 2, 75 Cong. Rec. 4766, demonstrates that ""Congress had no intent to relieve employers of any liability under the antitrust 
laws."" Appellees' Br. 46-47 (internal quotation omitted). This bit of history does not alter our view of § 4(a). HN22[
] 
""Statements by opponents of a bill and failure to enact suggested amendments, although they have some weight, are not the 
most reliable indications of congressional intent."" Bryant v. Yellen, 447 U.S. 352, 376, 100 S. Ct. 2232, 65 L. Ed. 2d 184 (1980); 
see Florey v. Sioux Falls Sch. Dist. 49-5, 619 F.2d 1311, 1315 (8th Cir. 1980). Other features of the proposed NLGA 
amendment may have contributed to its defeat. See 75 Cong. Rec. 4762-65 (1932). The argument also proves too much, 
because even without mention of employers in § 2, the Act expressly  [**54] restricts the issuance of injunctions against 
employers in circumstances that might otherwise violate the antitrust laws. See Cal. State Council of Carpenters v. Associated 
Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc., 648 F.2d 527, 544-45 (9th Cir. 1980) (discussing 29 U.S.C. § 104(b)), rev'd on other grounds, 459 
U.S. 519, 103 S. Ct. 897, 74 L. Ed. 2d 723 (1983). At any rate, we consider here only the scope of a district court's authority to 
issue injunctions, not the liability of employers under the antitrust laws. "
153,8," In Chicago Midtown Milk Distributors, 1970 U.S. App. LEXIS 8256, 1970 WL 2761, at *1, the Seventh Circuit reversed an 
injunction prohibiting two companies from refusing to supply and sell processed milk and other dairy products to certain 
distributors. The complaint alleged that ""a refusal to deal based upon a lockout"" violated the Sherman Act. In holding that the 
injunction was precluded by the NLGA, the court cited only § 1 of the Act. The court's reasoning is not well explained, and the 
opinion does not directly address § 4(a). "
163,9," Although the majority confines its analysis to the NLGA, I remain strongly convinced the other traditional injunction factors favor 
the Players. See Minn. Citizens Concerned for Life, Inc. v. Swanson, 640 F.3d 304, 310 (8th Cir. 2011) (setting forth the factors 
a court must consider). For the reasons set forth in my prior dissent, see Brady v. NFL, 640 F.3d 785, 794-96 (8th Cir. 2011) 
(Bye, J., dissenting), which have only intensified given the current juncture, I would affirm the district court. "
181,1," Defendants also argue that the Oregon legislature's narrow understanding of the equitable powers conferred by section 
646.775(1)(a) is evidenced by the legislature's rejection of a 2001 amendment to the Oregon Antitrust Statute that would have 
added the following language to the section: ""The equitable relief authorized by this subsection includes, but is  [*57] not limited 
to, 
restitution 
and 
disgorgement."" 
Proposed 
Oregon 
House 
Bill 
2218 
(2001), 
available 
at http://www.leg.state.or.us/01reg/pdf/HB2218.pdf. Defendants claim that the legislature's rejection of this proposed amendment 
shows that it views the equitable powers that the statute confers narrowly. Having reviewed the full legislative history of the proposed amendment, however, the Court finds defendants' argument 
unconvincing. The amendment was introduced by the Oregon Attorney General's Office to make explicit what the Attorney 
General believed the statute already authorized. See Tape Recording, House Committee on Judiciary, Subcommittee on 
Criminal Law, HB 2218 (Jan. 23, 2001) (statement of Assistant Attorney General Andrew Aubertine), available at

The 
Oregon

passed 
the amendment, but it was never voted on by the Senate. The transcript of Senate hearing suggests that the Attorney General 
withdrew the amendment because it was deemed unnecessary in light of other amendments to the statute. See id. "
184,1," The factual background is taken from the allegations contained in Patel's complaint. All allegations are accepted as true, and all

185,2," Presumably the Subway Agent position is transferable, but only with Subway's approval."
185,3," Only two of the three proposed transactions are accounted for: there is no mention in the complaint of an executed agreement 
concerning the two franchise locations in southern New Jersey which had been discussed at the meeting on May 19, 2008. 
Given that the locations were later transferred to Patel, this inconsistency appears to be an inadvertent omission."
185,4," It is not clear from the complaint whether this agreement either: (a) extinguished Patel's interest in SJ Subs and shifted the 
$200,000 originally paid for SJ Subs to the Subway Agent deposit; or (b) meant that the additional deposit requirement was 
waived on account of Patel's previous purchase. Because  [*5] one of Patel's central allegations concerns the undelivered 
interest in SJ Subs, the court assumes the latter. "
186,5," Plaintiff's complaint states that defendants' actions constitute ""a restraint of trade or commerce by Patel [sic] in violation of 1 
[sic] U.S.C. § 1 et seq."" Compl. at ¶ 61. Plaintiff explains in his memorandum in opposition  [*8] to the motion to dismiss that the 
Sherman Act was mistakenly ""referred to in the [c]omplaint as 1 U.S.C. § 1 et seq"" instead of ""15 U.S.C. § 1 et seq."" Pl.'s Resp. 
at 3 (Docket No. 6). Because ""[p]leadings must be construed so as to do justice,"" these typographical mistakes are disregarded. 
Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(e). "
187,6," The phrases ""reasonable interchangeability"" and ""cross-elasticity of demand"" refer to methods of defining the product market 
where anti-competitive effects are alleged to have occurred. The Third Circuit has summarized these methods as follows: The relevant product market is defined as those commodities reasonably interchangeable by consumers for the same 
purposes. Factors to be considered include price, use and qualities. Accordingly, the products in a relevant product market 
would be characterized by a cross-elasticity of demand, in other words, the rise in the price of a good within a relevant 
product market would tend to create a greater demand for other like goods in that market. Tunis Bros. Co. v. Ford Motor Co., 952 F.2d 715, 722 (3d Cir. 1991) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)."
187,7," A private civil remedy for a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1962 is expressly granted by 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c) (""Any person injured . . . 
by reason of a violation of section 1962 of this chapter may sue therefor in any appropriate United States district court . . . .""). "
188,8," Patel does not allege that anything else the defendants did constituted an instance of ""false or fraudulent pretenses, 
representations, or promises."" 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341, 1343."
188,9," Patel also cites 15 U.S.C. § 771 (describing the Comptroller General's supervision of the Federal Energy Administration) and 
70 P.S. § 1-401 (Pennsylvania fraud provision). Compl. at ¶ 92. Even correcting the first citation to 15 U.S.C. § 771(b)(1) 
(defining ""security""), neither statute creates a federal private right of action. "

198,1," Food 4 Less is an unincorporated operating division of Ralphs; it is a fictitious name under which Ralphs does business in 
Southern California."
198,2," There were in fact two agreements with identical terms, one pertaining to UFCW Local No. 770 and the other to UFCW Locals 
No. 135, 324, 1036, 1167, 1428, and 1442. We will refer to them as one agreement for simplicity. "
199,3," To implement this arrangement, the grocers agreed to submit their weekly sales data for an eight-week period before the strike 
and for the strike period to a certified public accountant. The CPA would use the data to determine  [**6] the grocers' historical 
percentage shares of the market (relative to one another) prior to the strike, and to calculate the aggregate increase or decrease 
in each grocer's average weekly sales during the strike. The CPA would then multiply the total amount of disparity for each 
grocer by 15% and those grocers earning revenues above their historical share would pay that amount in compensation to the 
lower performing grocer to return all grocers to their relative pre-strike positions. Food 4 Less and Ralphs were treated as one 
unit for purposes of this calculation."
199,4," The parties refer to this as the ""two-week tail."""
199,5, California sought a permanent injunction and attorneys' fees. 
203,6," The grocers rely on a decision from the Denver region of the NLRB, suggesting that a similar revenue sharing provision was a 
permissible practice, see Supp. Excerpts of Record (Vol. 3) 429-32, and on two courts of appeals decisions, Air Line Pilots Ass'n 
International v. Civil Aeronautics Board, 502 F.2d 453, 456-57, 163 U.S. App. D.C. 451 (D.C. Cir. 1974) (holding that revenue 
sharing among airline employers did not violate the  [**24] Railway Labor Act) and Kennedy v. Long Island Rail Road Co., 319 
F.2d 366, 368 (2d Cir. 1963) (holding that a joint strike insurance plan among leading railroads did not violate the Railway Labor 
Act, the Interstate Commerce Act, or the Sherman Act), for the proposition that revenue sharing is an accepted economic 
weapon. But a decision of a regional NLRB tribunal and the two appellate cases implicating, respectively, a different statutory "
204,," regime and a different type of arrangement, are not sufficiently prevalent authority to demonstrate the acceptability of the 
practice. To the contrary, these few cases show that revenue sharing in this context is sufficiently rare that it has not been widely 
examined by agencies and courts as a labor practice."
204,7," The grocers argue that the distinction between agreements affecting business or product markets and those affecting labor 
markets is no longer relevant to the non-statutory labor exemption  [**28] analysis following Brown. The Court did not expressly 
address the significance of the distinction in deciding Brown. The D.C. Circuit below had held that the exemption waives antitrust 
liability for restraints on competition that ""operate primarily in a labor market characterized by collective bargaining,"" but the 
Supreme Court chose to interpret the exemption more narrowly. Brown, 518 U.S. at 235 (quoting Brown v. Pro Football, Inc., 
50 F.3d 1041, 1056, 311 U.S. App. D.C. 89 (D.C. Cir. 1995)). At no point did it explicitly reject the product market/ labor market 
distinction or question its earlier cases that relied in part on the distinction. Id. at 236, 237 (citing Pennington, 381 U.S. at 657). 
Brown suggests that the distinction may not be central to the analysis in all cases, but we conclude that it remains a relevant 
consideration in determining whether a restraint ""plays a significant role in a collective-bargaining process that itself constitutes 
an important part of the Nation's industrial relations system."" Brown, 518 U.S. at 240. Other circuits are in accord. E.g., Am. 
Steel Erectors, 536 F.3d at 79; Clarett, 369 F.3d at 134 n.14. "
205,8," We are reluctant to expand the non-statutory exemption beyond the scope of Brown without further guidance from the Supreme 
Court. See Brown, 518 U.S. at 250 (noting that its holding was ""not intended to insulate from antitrust review every joint 
imposition of terms by employers,"" but that it ""need not decide in this case whether, or where, within these extreme outer 
boundaries to draw that line"")."
205,9," Chief Judge Kozinski's partial dissent contends that, in light of the stipulations of the parties, our ruling on the non-statutory 
labor exemption is ""very likely"" an advisory opinion and beyond the scope of our jurisdiction. That position does not present a 
correct view of our Article III jurisdiction, and would seem to foreclose ruling on many issues squarely presented. The issue of 
whether the RSP is exempt from antitrust scrutiny —which was expressly ruled on by the district court and preserved for appeal 
by the parties—is a threshold question that logically precedes our examination of the antitrust issues. If in addressing the 
exemption we determined that the RSP should be insulated from antitrust review, there would be no need to consider whether 
the RSP could be condemned with a per se rule or under ""quick look"" analysis. We properly may determine whether the antitrust 
regime applies at all before we rule on the merits of the antitrust claim. "
206,10," As  [**35] we have previously explained, HN15[
] ""[t]he rule of reason weighs legitimate justifications for a restraint against 
any anticompetitive effects. We review all the facts, including the precise harms alleged to the competitive markets, and the 
legitimate justifications provided for the challenged practice, and we determine whether the anticompetitive aspects of the 
challenged practice outweigh its procompetitive effects."" Paladin Assocs., Inc. v. Mont. Power Co., 328 F.3d 1145, 1156 (9th Cir. 
2003) (citing Nw. Wholesale Stationers, Inc. v. Pac. Stationery & Printing Co., 472 U.S. 284, 290-93, 105 S. Ct. 2613, 86 L. Ed. 
2d 202 (1985) (footnote omitted)). The rule of reason is responsible for a sensible application of the antitrust laws that has 
guided courts for almost a century. See Chi. Bd. of Trade v. United States, 246 U.S. 231, 238, 38 S. Ct. 242, 62 L. Ed. 683 
(1918) (providing the classic formulation of the rule of reason by Justice Brandeis: ""The true test of legality is whether the 
restraint imposed is such as merely regulates and perhaps thereby promotes competition or whether it is such as may suppress 
or even destroy competition.""); see also Nat'l Soc'y of Prof'l Eng'rs, 435 U.S. 679, 687-91, 98 S. Ct. 1355, 55 L. Ed. 2d 637 
(1978); Cont'l T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., 433 U.S. 36, 49-50, 97 S. Ct. 2549, 53 L. Ed. 2d 568 (1977)."
206,11," HN17[
] Practices that have been held per se illegal include geographic division of markets and horizontal price fixing. See Major League Baseball Props., Inc. v. Salvino, Inc., 542 F.3d 290, 315 (2d Cir. 2008) (collecting cases). "
208,12," While labor disputes are capable of dragging on for months or years, it does not appear that anyone realistically expected the 
RSP to continue for anywhere near the extended period of time at issue in Citizen Publishing."
208,13," The Supreme Court has recognized that ""[t]he retail food industry is very competitive and repetitive patronage is highly 
important."" NLRB v. Brown, 380 U.S. 278, 284, 85 S. Ct. 980, 13 L. Ed. 2d 839 (1965)."
208,14," An agreement of limited and/or indefinite duration could have obvious anticompetitive effects and violate Section 1, for 
example, an agreement of competitors controlling most of the market to fix prices for a month to the detriment of consumers. But 
here, the limited and unknown length of the RSP separates it from a category of restraints with which we are sufficiently 
experienced to condemn without inquiry into actual competitive harms. "
209,15," California offers a series of cases in addition to Citizen Publishing in an effort to demonstrate that HN21[
] profit-pooling 
arrangements have long been condemned as per se  [**46] illegal. See, e.g., United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., 334 
U.S. 131, 149, 68 S. Ct. 915, 92 L. Ed. 1260 (1948) (holding that an agreement among five producers of motion pictures and 
their affiliates to share profits according to prearranged percentages was anticompetitive); N. Sec. Co. v. United States, 193 U.S. 
197, 24 S. Ct. 436, 48 L. Ed. 679 (1904) (invalidating an agreement among stockholders in competing interstate railway 
companies to form one corporation with a controlling interest in the stock of each railway); Chi., M. & St. P. Ry. Co. v. Wabash, 
St. L. & P. Ry. Co., 61 F. 993 (8th Cir. 1894) (invalidating an agreement among seven competing railroad companies to, among 
other things, pool gross earnings for a period of twenty-five years); Anderson v. Jett, 89 Ky. 375, 12 S.W. 670, 11 Ky. L. Rptr. 
570 (Ky. 1889) (voiding a multi-year arrangement between rival steamboat owners to end their rivalry by sharing profits 
according to fixed percentages). None of these cases, alone or in combination, establishes sufficient judicial experience with a 
revenue sharing agreement of limited duration, among some competitors in a market, so as to permit per se treatment of the 
RSP. HN22[
] The fundamental economics of the firms and the public interest do not require per se prohibitory 
 [**47] treatment of the challenged practice during a labor dispute. "
210,16," Also, if experts gave conflicting views on these subjects, and they were material to resolution, then the decision of the trier of 
fact might control the outcome."
210,17," The grocers argue that the RSP has procompetitive benefits in the form of lower prices for consumers as a result of the 
grocers' ability to negotiate a more favorable contract on labor costs. Because California has not met its burden to show that the 
RSP is obviously anticompetitive, we need not address the grocers' procompetitive justifications. "
211,18," The ultimate competitive question may not be determined in this case because the State of California, to gain a final judgment 
that could be appealed at this time, has stipulated to foregoing its challenge to the RSP under the traditional rule of reason, 
contending instead that the RSP is invalid per se or on a ""quick look."" "
215,1," See Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, 310 U.S. 469, 493, 60 S. Ct. 982, 84 L. Ed. 1311 (1940) (""The end sought [by Congress in 
passing the Sherman Act] was the prevention of restraints to free competition in business and commercial transactions which 
tended to restrict production, raise prices or otherwise control the market to the detriment of purchasers or consumers of goods 
and services, all of which had come to be regarded as a special form of public injury.""); see also Spectrum Sports, Inc. v. 
McQuillan, 506 U.S. 447, 458, 113 S. Ct. 884, 122 L. Ed. 2d 247 (1993) (""The purpose of the [Sherman] Act is not to protect 
businesses from the working of the market; it is to protect the public from the failure of the market. The law directs itself not 
against conduct which is competitive, even severely so, but against conduct which unfairly tends to destroy competition itself. It 
does so not out of solicitude for private concerns  [**69] but out of concern for the public interest.""); City of Lafayette v. La. 
Power & Light Co., 435 U.S. 389, 398, 98 S. Ct. 1123, 55 L. Ed. 2d 364 (1978) (In passing the Sherman Act, Congress ""sought 
to establish a regime of competition as the fundamental principle governing commerce in this country."")."
215,2," Defendants also contend that their profit sharing agreement is exempt from the antitrust laws because they employ it as a 
bargaining tactic in an anticipated labor dispute. The majority concludes that the profit sharing agreement does not qualify for the 
nonstatutory labor exemption and I agree. See Maj. Op. at 9289-9302. "
216,3," Inherent in the summary nature of quick look and per se analysis is the possibility that a restraint that would survive a full rule of 
reason analysis in a particular case will nonetheless be invalidated: ""For the sake of business certainty and litigation efficiency, 
we have tolerated the invalidation of some agreements that a fullblown inquiry might have proved to be reasonable."" Maricopa "
217,," Cnty. Med., 457 U.S. at 344. The ultimate inquiry in both analyses is establishing a sufficiently high likelihood of anticompetitive 
effect to justify foreclosing, in the name of certainty and efficiency goals, the possibility that a more in depth review would reveal 
that a restraint was on balance  [**76] benign or even beneficial. See Major League Baseball Props., Inc. v. Salvino, Inc., 542 
F.3d 290, 340 n.10 (2d Cir. 2008) (Sotomayor, J., concurring in the judgment) (quick look and per se ""methods of analysis are 
reserved for practices that 'facially appear [ ] to be one[s] that would always or almost always tend to restrict competition and 
decrease output.'"" (alterations in original) (quoting Broad. Music, Inc. v. CBS, 441 U.S. 1, 19-20, 99 S. Ct. 1551, 60 L. Ed. 2d 1 
(1979)). "
218,4," I note that the district court should not have accorded the expert's statement any weight given its explicitly speculative nature. 
""An expert's opinions that are without factual basis and are based on speculation or conjecture"" are inadmissible at trial and are 
""inappropriate material for consideration on a motion for summary judgment."" Major League Baseball, 542 F.3d at 311. "
221,5," This effect has been well understood for many years, and was ably explained well over a hundred years ago by the Kentucky 
Court of Appeal, then the highest court in that state, in the following discussion of a profit sharing arrangement between two 
steamboat companies: There was a strong stimulation to increase the net profits by means other than that of popular favor springing out of efficient 
steamboat facilities and close attention  [**93] to the business of shipping for reasonable charges and courteous attention 
to passengers at reasonable fare. . . . It is the competition, or fear of competition, that makes these carriers efficient, 
attentive, polite, and reasonable in charges. Remove competition, or the fear of it, and they become extortionate, 
inattentive, impolite, and negligent. . . . It is said that neither was bound to charge the same as the other. That is true; but 
either could extort with impunity, and the other would be an equal recipient of the fruit of the extortion. . . . It is true that their 
contract did not, in so many words, bind them to any given charges; but it made it to the interest of each, not only to charge, 
but to encourage and sustain the other in charges that would amount to confiscation. . . . This combination was more than 
that of a combination not to take freight or passengers at less than certain prices. In such case, the combiners have to 
furnish adequate means of transportation, and efficient and polite officers, and confine themselves as nearly as possible to 
the sum agreed upon, in order to secure the trade, or a reasonable portion of it; but here, by reason of the agreement, . . . 
 [**94] . [i]nefficient means of transportation [and] unskilled or inattentive officials[ ] are no drawback to either boat. Its share 
of the profits come[s] notwithstanding. Anderson v. Jett, 89 Ky. 375, 12 S.W. 670, 671, 11 Ky. L. Rptr. 570 (Ky. 1889). "
222,6," IIA Areeda & Hovenkamp ¶ 391b(1) at 323 (""[W]hether a price-fixing conspiracy among sellers involves everyone or only a 
dominant group, this business practice leads to overcharges that constitute antitrust injury. The same can be said for business 
practices that are economically equivalent — for example, agreements on market division, product quality, credit terms, and the 
like."")."
222,7," No precise  [**101] standard exists for determining when a firm or a group of firms controls enough of a market that its actions 
might cause anticompetitive effects. However, the uncontested facts about defendants' share of the market and the fragmented 
nature of the rest of the market together appear to be sufficient to establish the monopoly power over the market required for a 
violation of section 2 of the Sherman Act, a higher standard than is required to find that a firm or firms had sufficient power in the 
market that their actions could violate section 1. See Am. Tobacco Co. v. United States, 328 U.S. 781, 797, 66 S. Ct. 1125, 90 L. 
Ed. 1575 (1946) (a firm with over two-thirds of the market is a monopoly); Syufy Enters. v. Am. Multicinema, Inc., 793 F.2d 990,

Stigler, A Theory of Oligopoly, 72 J. Pol. Econ. 44 (1964) (arguing that successful collusion requires firms to overcome particular 
market uncertainties; one of the key uncertainties is whether another firm will ""cheat"" its rivals by offering a lower price)); United

223,8," Another consideration is that many alleged competitors' product offerings differ substantially from those of defendants, 
including box stores selling goods in bulk, such as Costco; retailers selling a limited selection of products and brands, 
 [**103] such as Trader Joe's; and stores specializing in organic foods, such as Whole Foods. These markets are by their nature 
incapable of competing for much of the business of traditional supermarkets such as those operated by defendants. 
Notwithstanding these obvious facts, Costco, Trader Joe's, and Whole Foods were each alleged by defendants to have placed 
competitive pressure on them during the labor dispute."
223,9," Interestingly, economic theory suggests an even stronger negative effect on competition: it would appear to predict that, at 
least in the short run, in a market in which large, dominant firms have an agreement limiting competition amongst themselves, 
such an agreement will tend to increase the prices charged by those large firms, and that smaller firms, rather than increasing 
whatever economic pressure they ordinarily exert on those larger firms by charging the lower prices that would obtain under 
competitive conditions in order to attract the larger firms' customers, but will instead charge higher prices close to those being 
charged by the larger firms. See Herbert Hovenkamp, Federal Antitrust Policy § 4.1b (1994). Firms that pool profits are acting as 
a kind of cartel, and cartels  [**104] that do not contain all the firms in the market are still able to raise prices above the prices 
that would be observed in a competitive marketplace, especially in a short term situation like that present here, in which the fixed 
costs of starting a supermarket (leases, employment and product purchasing contracts, signage, etc.) make it unlikely that new 
firms would enter the market to take advantage of the prices that are artificially high due to the cartel's collusive behavior. See 
Dennis W. Carlton & Jeffrey M. Perloff, Modern Industrial Organization 107-15, 122 (3d ed. 2000). Additionally, fixing market 
shares at precartel levels, as defendants essentially did here, is an ""effective technique"" for preventing cheating (in the form of 
competitive behavior) among members of the cartel. See id. at 139-40. "
224,10," A more urgent financial condition would appear, if anything, to make it less likely that defendants would commit resources to 
competing with each other for customers from whom they would receive profits, if at all, only at some future date. To any extent 
that lower demand, lower supply, or strike-caused financial woes would prompt a defendant to try to win customers from vendors 
external to the agreement, the profit sharing agreement would, as in a nonstrike period, reduce its incentive for doing so: while 
the defendant would  [**107] pay the entire cost (in advertising, improved quality, or discounting) of luring such customers, it 
would retain only a fraction of the benefit generated equal to its prestrike share of the market, and a substantial number of the 
new customers might well, for reasons discussed earlier, be lost by the time the labor dispute and profit sharing ended. "
225,11," The obviously anticompetitive nature of defendants' profit sharing agreement in a traditional market setting distinguishes it 
from the restraint in California Dental Association. Here, there is a long history of adjudging profit sharing agreements to be 
anticompetitive and of demonstrating the validity of that conclusion. The unique limits on price and quality advertising by dentists 
that were at issue in California Dental Association might have been thought by some to reduce incentives to compete over price 
or quality, because without such advertising it would be difficult for a dentist to inform potential customers about his advantages 
over his competitors and, thus, lowering his prices or expending resources to improve his quality might simply have reduced his 
profits from existing customers. However, the Court reasoned that the nature  [**113] of the market for ""professional services"" 
such as dental care was unique and that the circumstances made it difficult to compare services across providers and to verify 
price and service information, meaning that price and quality advertising might have been misleading, and misleading 
advertising itself poses dangers to competition. See Cal. Dental Ass'n, 526 U.S. at 771-72. Accordingly, the Court concluded, 
that because of the ""professional context,"" it was not implausible that, as a theoretical matter, the restriction on price advertising 
had either a positive effect or no effect on competition. See id. at 774-75. The Court emphasized that theoretical claims of 
anticompetitive effects that are not evident or established in antitrust law must be carefully considered and clearly explained in 
order to justify shifting the burden to defendants to show some procompetitive effect. See id. at 775 n.12. Here, the subjective 
factors that the Court found were critical to the sale of professional services do not exist. Economic theory as well as a practical 
analysis of the factual circumstances make it clear that there is a high likelihood that the profit sharing agreement had 
anticompetitive  [**114] effects. Unlike California Dental Association, there is a clear theoretical basis for concluding that a profit 
sharing agreement would have anticompetitive effects, and, again unlike California Dental Association, there is no plausible 
basis, theoretical or otherwise, for concluding that the profit sharing agreement had procompetitive effects, see infra section IV.2. 
Accordingly, the burden to demonstrate evidence of the restraints' procompetitive effects falls on defendants, who do not meet it 
in any way. "
226,12," Defendants' evidence purporting to show that employees charged with pricing during the dispute did not know about the profit 
sharing agreement and took no action because of it, which was relied upon by the district court, also fails to provide support for 
their contentions. Their evidence on this point is both skeletal and somewhat dubious. Defendants do not come close to 
demonstrating that all employees with power over pricing were ignorant of the agreement or took no action because of it. See, 
e.g., Declaration of Bryan Davis ¶ 3 (Albertsons employee describing himself as responsible only for the prices in a discreet 
category of groceries); Declaration of Carla Simpson ¶ 2 (Safeway employee describing herself as having responsibility only for 
implementing pricing established by another department). Moreover, early in the strike the Los Angeles Times published a front-
page article revealing that the chains had agreed to share the financial burden of the strike. See Nancy Cleeland  [**117] & 
Melinda Fulmer, In Tactical Move, Union Pulls Pickets From Ralphs, L.A. Times, Nov. 1, 2003, at A1. More important, it would 
defeat entirely the efficiency goals underlying the existence of per se, quick look, and ""meet for the case"" analysis if defendants 
could preclude a summary finding, and proceed to full rule of reason analysis, simply by asserting that the employees in charge 
of pricing did not know about the profit sharing. Such assertions are easy to make, while proving or disproving who knew what, 
and whether the knowledge of a particular individual had any effect on whether the company acted in a competitive manner, 
would require exactly the sort of onerous and costly production of evidence that summary review is meant to avoid. In any case, 
as noted above, the quick look inquiry is a probabilistic one: in order to place the burden on defendants to demonstrate that the 
agreement had a procompetitive effect, California need prove only that defendants' agreement to share profits created a great 
likelihood of anticompetitive effects. Accordingly, even if the anticompetitive effects had not come to pass because certain 
employees did not learn of the agreement or did not correctly  [**118] calculate where the company's interests lay in light of the 
agreement, that fact would be immaterial to the result of our inquiry. "

capacity or in the course of their agency or employment upon a claim or cause of action unless: (a) Within 120 days after the happening of the event giving rise to the claim, written notice of the circumstances of the claim

injunction under Wis. Stat. § 133.16. The circuit court clarified this at the summary judgment hearing: [Counsel for E-Z]: . . . We're asking, Your Honor, for injunctive relief so this method of operation stops and stops 
immediately. [The Court]: See, I didn't read your complaint as asking for injunctive relief, but perhaps I missed that. [Counsel for E-Z]: Let me find it. Well, maybe it would be better stated as to—as to declaratory relief, that is declaring the

244,12," ""Declaratory relief"" is ""a binding adjudication that establishes the rights and other legal relations of the parties without

official capacity."" Subsection (1)(b) is seemingly in tension with § 133.18(6), which caps the amount of monetary damages a 
plaintiff may recover in a suit against a governmental entity. The circuit court, relying on subsection (1)(b), struck E-Z's request 
for treble damages, costs, and attorney fees under § 133.18(1)(a). However, the circuit court expressly reserved the question of 
whether the language of subsection (1)(b) ""precludes recovery of any monetary damages against [Oneida] County for violations 
alleged under any provision in Wis. Stat. ch. 133."" Neither the circuit court nor the court of appeals further addressed this tension 
because both courts concluded that the question of whether  [****21] the notice of claim statute applied was dispositive. This 
issue was not briefed before this court and we therefore need not address whether E-Z pled a viable claim for damages against 
Oneida County pursuant to § 133.18."

The Nesbitt court held that Wis. Stat. § 32.05 provided a detailed ""procedure and deadline for commencing [condemnation] 
actions, as well as specifying other matters, such as how other interested parties may join the appeal and what issues may be 
tried."" Id., ¶10. Wis. Stat. § 133.18 contains no such detailed procedures. Instead, § 133.18 merely creates a cause of action, 
defines the damages, and provides a lengthy six-year statute of limitations. Nesbitt  [****22] is, therefore, easily distinguishable. "

252,6," In concluding  [****46] that ch. 133 contains a specific statutory scheme, the court of appeals relied on Gillen v. City of Neenah, 
219 Wis. 2d 806, 580 N.W.2d 628 (1998). E-Z Roll Off, LLC v. Cnty. of Oneida, 2010 WI App 76, ¶18, 325 Wis. 2d 423, 785 
N.W.2d 645. The majority opinion concludes that the reasoning of Gillen is ""instructive,"" yet ""inapplicable to the present case."" 
Majority op., ¶28. In so concluding, the majority states that ""[i]n contrast to the plaintiffs in Gillen, E-Z does not seek immediate 
injunctive relief under Wis. Stat. § 133.16. Rather, E-Z seeks declaratory relief and damages under Wis. Stat. § 133.18."" Id. 
However, the distinction between the remedy sought by the plaintiffs in Gillen and the remedy E-Z sought in its complaint is not 
relevant to the determination of whether ch. 133 comprises a specific statutory scheme. Surely, a specific statutory scheme can 
include more than one section of a chapter. Here, the entirety of ch. 133 addresses anticompetitive conduct. The scheme is 
quite specific and quite comprehensive. Stated otherwise, the statutory scheme includes several statutory sections. Furthermore, by considering only a single statutory section, specifically Wis. Stat. § 133.18,  [****47] rather than the entire 
statutory scheme set out in ch. 133 that proscribes anticompetitive conduct, the majority's focus is too narrow. For example, a 
Wis. Stat. § 133.03(1) claimant could seek both damages under § 133.18 and a temporary and/or permanent injunction under 
Wis. Stat. § 133.16. Under the majority's reasoning, would that ch. 133 claim be an exception to the notice of claim provisions of 
Wis. Stat. § 893.80(1) given our decision in Gillen "
253,7," The majority concludes that it does not need to determine what ""event"" gave rise to the obligation to give notice, and 
consequently when the cause of action began to accrue. The majority so concludes because even if it accepted E-Z's argument 
that the cause of action did not accrue until it learned of the agreement in February, 2004, more than 120 days passed between 
when the cause accrued and E-Z's filing of the notice of claim in September 2005. Majority op., ¶43."

certification as to the breach of contract claim against DFA. The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit recently denied 
defendants' request for permission to file an interlocutory appeal of the Court's class certification order and motions to decertify 
the class are currently pending."
287,2," This order will not address the motion for summary judgment filed by DFA as to the breach of contract claim. The parties have 
agreed to stay that count pending the trial or other disposition of the other claims. "
288,3," This language is quoted from the text of Rule 56(c)(2) effective until December 1, 2010. The language in the text effective, 
December 1, 2010, is slightly different; however, the standard for granting summary judgment remains the same. "
292,4, Both plaintiffs and defendants incorrectly  [**28] cite this case as a Sixth Circuit decision. 
295,5," Dr. Rausser acknowledges that based upon his analysis of the available data, ""the geographic boundaries of the relevant 
market include Orders 5, 6 and 7."" Rassuer Rpt p. 66. Order 6, that is, Florida,  [**39] also has severely limited options to move 
milk out of its order. In addition, 6 of the 12 Order 6 pool distributing plants which are the closest plants to Orders 5 and 7 are 
controlled by Dean and NDH. Rassuer Rpt. p. 62. Therefore, Order 6 is very similarly situated to Orders 5 and 7 but was not 
included in the relevant geographic market."
295,6," Plaintiffs do not explain why Professor Rausser would have considered the amount of milk coming into Orders 5 and 7 as one 
of the ""commercial realities"" if determination of the relevant market did not require him to do so. "
296,7," Monopsonization is monopoly power exercised by a buyer, rather than a seller, Telcor Communications, Inc. v. Southwestern 
Bell Telephone Co., 305 F.3d 1124 (10th Cir. 2002), and is sometimes referred to as a ""mirror image"" of monopolization. 
Weyerhaeuser Co. v. Ross-Simmons Hardwood Lumber Co., Inc., 549 U.S. 312, 321, 127 S. Ct. 1069, 166 L. Ed. 2d 911 
(2007). "
300,8," The Court has previously noted the illogical nature of this statement and fails to grasp how all defendants would act in concert 
with other of the defendants. "
303,9," The Carlin court noted this Court's prior decision not to apply the filed-rate doctrine, specifically noting that this Court's decision 
was based on the fact that ""the rates being challenged were not the minimum blend rate determined by the Secretary, but were 
over-order premiums above the minimum rates that were allegedly manipulated by the defendants' anti-competitive behavior."" 
690 F.Supp.2d at 1134. "
304,10," Plaintiffs do, as they must, acknowledge that ""some of Prof. Rausser's damages rely on re-calculating the federal blend price. 
If true, those damages would be disallowed, not plaintiffs' entire claims."" Plaintiffs would have considerably more credibility with 
the Court if they would simply acknowledge that Professor Rausser does in fact re-calculate the federal blend price. He states 
unequivocally in his report that he does so. "
307,11," The Court loosely refers to plaintiffs' ""facts."" In reality, what plaintiffs often refer to as ""facts"" are simply inferences they seek to 
draw from other facts or conclusory statements, or they simply misstate the facts established."
307,12," This ""fact"" offered by plaintiffs is a stark example of how plaintiffs misinterpret the facts which  [**88] are established by the 
record. The fact relied upon by the plaintiffs in its statement of facts is: ""In 2000, Lonestar sued DFA alleging that it, under 
Hanman's management and while Bos was CFO, unlawfully monopolized southeastern states, including Arkansas, Louisiana, 
Mississippi, and Missouri, and interfered with Lonestar's access to processing plants."" From this ""fact"", plaintiffs argue that it is 
established that Bos was directly involved in every financial aspect of the conspiracy and his familiarity with this prior lawsuit 
""demonstrates that he knew that he was engaging in potential unlawful acts,"" a conclusion not even remotely justified by the 
""fact"" offered by the plaintiffs. If such a conclusion were applicable, this would mean that any financial officer of any corporation 
which engaged in unlawful activity would be held responsible simply because of his or her knowledge of the financial aspects of 
the business. In addition, a conclusion that Bos knew of the unlawful nature of his acts cannot be established based on the fact 
that he knew that his employer had previously been sued. "
308,13," Once again, the Court notes that plaintiffs' attempt to state the standard as one that requires  [**89] ""participation,"" not one 
that requires that the individual defendant ""actively and knowingly"" participate. "
309,14," Plaintiffs state in their brief that many other cases reach the same conclusion. They do not, however, cite a single one of them. "
310,15," Plaintiffs have, in response to Hanman's claim with respect to lack of market power for the claim of attempted 
monopoly/monopsony, responded  [**96] that a showing of market power is not necessary to their conspiracy claim. This 
further bolsters the Court's prior decision that, in reality, plaintiffs claim is one for conspiracy to monopolize/monopsonize rather 
than attempt to monopolize/monopsonize."
310,16," SMA's supplemental motion relates only to Count Five, the § 2 claim. SMA does not separately address the § 2 claims 
regarding monopolization and monopsonation which are addressed in the joint motions for summary judgment. "
326,1," Because Bertelsmann, Inc., Sony Corporation of America, and Time Warner, Inc., are parent companies of other named 
defendants, the analysis proceeds somewhat differently for these three defendants. Therefore, the Court will refer to the named 
entities other than the three parent companies  [**18] as ""Defendants,"" and the parent company defendants will be called the 
""Parent Companies"" with their arguments analyzed separately. "
327,2," There are two salient exceptions. The first is an amendment to paragraph 99, which was proposed but denied as futile in the 
now-vacated order dismissing the complaint. The TCAC contains the amended language, which was considered by the Court of 
Appeals in its analysis, Starr, 592 F.3d at 323 n.3, and is considered here. The second exception is that the TCAC contains 
paragraphs 146-153, which were not included in the Second Consolidated Amended Complaint. Those paragraphs allege 
violations of the Illinois and New York  [**19] state antitrust laws, and they are discussed in this opinion. "
329,3," Even if the Ottinger release were to bar these claims, it would be effective only for claims through September 29, 2003. The 
release by its terms only applies to members of the Ottinger class, which includes claims arising from CD purchases from June 
1, 1991 to September 23, 2003. (Almeida Decl. Ex. E, §§ 1.5, 1.16, 1.19.) "
331,4," Other futures-market cases Plaintiffs rely upon are similarly distinguishable; in all of those cases, allegations of contractual or 
highly correlated price movements were at issue. E.g., Sanner v. Bd. of Trade of Chi., 62 F.3d 918, 929 (7th Cir. 1995); Ice 
Cream Liquidation, Inc. v. Land O' Lakes, Inc., 253 F. Supp. 2d 262, 274 (D. Conn. 2003) (""Defendants concede that plaintiff has 
alleged a causal link between the CME butter price and the wholesale price of milk, cream, and butter.""). "
332,5," It is illustrative that the Court of Appeals hardly mentioned CDs in its opinion vacating this Court's earlier judgment dismissing 
the case. Its explanation for why the complaint survives focused instead on the Internet Music-related allegations. Only once did 
the Court of Appeals mention CDs in that discussion, and that mention referenced the lack of any reduction in the price for 
Internet Music ""as compared to CDs."" Starr, 592 F.3d at 323. "
333,6," The TCAC amends its allegations to include violations of Illinois state law. (TCAC ¶¶ 146-149.) Illinois is a state from which no 
named plaintiff hails, making the total fourteen states, a one-state increase from the thirteen states identified in the parties' 
papers. (Pl. 2007 Opp. at 25 n.23.) "
334,7," In supplemental briefing, Defendants state that the state statutes ""apply exclusively to intrastate - not interstate - conduct."" 
(Def. Response to Pl. Supp. Auth. Dated June 10, 2010, at 5.) If this argument is that relief under these statutes is exclusive of 
any applicable federal relief for interstate activity, the Court rejects it. ""[T]he Court does not interpret the statutes to be "
335,," inapplicable where the anticompetitive conduct may have both interstate effects and, as concerns the particular state in 
question, intrastate impact."" Sheet Metal Workers, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 62181, 2008 WL 3833577, at *12 (collecting cases)."
335,8," Plaintiffs dispute that Michigan, West Virginia, and South Dakota require intrastate allegations. HN11[
] The Michigan statute explicitly requires the unlawful restraint of trade to be in ""a relevant market,"" Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. § 445.771,  [**51] which it 
defines as an area of competition, ""all or any part of which is within the state,"" Id. § 445.772. Thus, the Court assumes that an 
allegation of intrastate conduct is required in Michigan. HN12[
] West Virginia and South Dakota have statutes that courts have 
held to be ambiguous as to whether the conspiracy or the conduct must be alleged to have been within the state. S.D. Codified 
Laws § 37-1-3.1 (""[A] conspiracy . . . in restraint of trade or commerce any part of which is within this state is unlawful.""); W. Va. 
Code § 47-18-3 (similar); see, e.g., In re NMV, 350 F. Supp. 2d at 172, 175 (holding statutes ambiguous). In light of this potential 
ambiguity, courts have held that the states intended to cover as broad a range of activities as possible and that the statutes 
require allegations of some conduct within the state. In re Intel Corp. Microprocessor Antitrust Litig., 496 F. Supp. 2d 404, 414 
(D. Del. 2007); In re NMV, 350 F. Supp. 2d at 172, 175. Accordingly, Plaintiffs' objections to having to allege intrastate conduct 
or effects as to South Dakota and West Virginia are meritless, and the Court assumes that those states require an allegation of 
intrastate conduct."
335,9," ""It would have been helpful if the plaintiffs had added allegations of state-directed activity."" In re NMV, 350 F. Supp. 2d at 169 
n.2. For example, simply adding an allegation of conduct throughout the United States ""and in each listed state"" would be 
superior pleading. "
336,10," Defendants offer no developed argument or legal authority for their claim that the TCAC is insufficient under the District of 
Columbia, Florida, Maine, Massachusetts, or Nebraska consumer protection laws. Absent Defendants' invocation of some legal 
basis to dismiss these claims, the Court will not do so. The claims under these states' laws may proceed. "
338,11," The Court rejects Defendants' first argument: that unjust enrichment is disallowed where an adequate remedy at law exists. 
This argument is premature because HN20[
] Plaintiffs may plead in the alternative. In re K-Dur Antitrust Litig., 338 F. Supp. 2d"
338,517," , 544 (D.N.J. 2004). Likewise, Defendants' argument that Plaintiffs' lack of privity with at least some defendants is groundless 
because, as Plaintiffs argue (without Defendants' refutation), no state at issue here has a privity requirement to plead unjust 
enrichment. Id.; see Pl. 2007 Mem. at 38 & n.47 (citing cases). Defendants' reliance on cases discussing incidental benefits is 
misplaced; this case may involve certain indirect benefits, but it does not involve incidental benefits. "
339,12," Of the other states in which plaintiffs purportedly reside as pleaded in this action, HN25[
] Arizona, California, the District of 
Columbia, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, South Dakota, Tennessee, Vermont, West Virginia, and 
Wisconsin have passed Illinois Brick repealer laws or their courts have held that state law permits indirect purchaser suits by 
individuals. The Court relies on the following authority from each state in holding that these states do  [**70] not follow Illinois 
Brick: Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 16750(a); D.C. Code § 28-4509(a); Kan. Stat. Ann. § 50-161; Me. Rev. Stat. tit. 10, § 1104(1); 
Mich. Comp. Laws § 445.778(2); Minn. Stat. § 325D.57; Nev. Rev. Stat § 598A.210(2); N.M. Stat. Ann. § 57-1-3(A); S.D. 
Codified Laws § 37-1-33; Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 9, § 2465; W. Va. Code R. 142-9-2; Wis. Stat. § 133.18(1)(a); Bunker's Glass Co. v. 
Pilkington PLC, 206 Ariz. 9, 75 P.3d 99, 102 (Ariz. 2003); Comes v. Microsoft Corp., 646 N.W.2d 440, 441 (Iowa 2002); 
Sherwood v. Microsoft Corp., No. M2000-01850, 2003 Tenn. App. LEXIS 539, 2003 WL 21780975, at *29 (Tenn. Ct. App. July 
31, 2003). Massachusetts is somewhat different in that HN26[
] only direct purchasers may maintain a cause of action under 
the state antitrust act, but both direct and indirect purchasers may maintain a cause of action under the state consumer 
protection act. Ciardi v. Hoffmann-LaRoche, Ltd., 436 Mass. 53, 762 N.E.2d 303, 308-09, 312 (Mass. 2002). Plaintiffs do not 
assert a cause of action under the Massachusetts antitrust act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93, § 1 et seq., relying instead only on the "
340,," consumer protection law, id. ch. 93A, § 1 et seq. Because the parties have not briefed whether the TCAC is sufficient to state a 
cause  [**71] of action under the Massachusetts consumer protection law, the Court will allow a parasitic unjust enrichment 
claim to proceed for Massachusetts plaintiffs, if any. "
341,13, This holding indicates that Plaintiffs have no standing to bring suit under the Illinois law. 
343,14," Although the place of Time Warner's incorporation is not stated in the complaint, the Court takes judicial notice that Time 
Warner is a Delaware corporation. Time Warner, Inc., Quarterly Report (Form 10-Q) (May 4, 2011); see Citadel Equity Fund Ltd. 
v. Aquila, Inc., 168 F. App'x 474, 476 (2d Cir. 2006). "
344,15," With respect to Bertlesmann, the TCAC states that Bertlesmann AG, not Bertlesmann, Inc., has an ownership in Sony BMG 
(TCAC ¶ 21), but Plaintiffs state in their memorandum of law that Bertlesmann, Inc., is the owner. Moreover, the TCAC alleges 
that Bertlesmann (and SCA) transferred their ""musical copyrights, licensing agreements and royalty rights"" to Sony BMG, a 
separate entity that ""produces, licenses and distributes"" the music involved in this lawsuit. (Id.) Whether Bertlesmann or 
Bertlesmann AG owns an interest in Sony BMG  [**88] is thus not material for the purpose of this motion; in either case, there is 
no basis to pierce either entity's corporate veil. "
348,1," In its certification of compliance, the United States listed the permanent website as http://www.justice.gov/atr/ 
cases/americanexpress.html. (Docket Entry # 133.) "
349,2," Sears also raised several concerns over whether the proposed consent judgment would require Visa and MasterCard to 
identify, at the point of sale, which type of card, e.g., credit or debit, or ""cash-back"" or ""reward points,"" the consumer wishes to 
use. (Sears Comment at 2-3.) As the United States has correctly pointed out in its Response, these concerns are ""beyond the "
350,," scope of the case"" insofar as the ""[t]he Amended Complaint alleges violations relating only to the General Purpose Card product 
market, a market that does not include debit cards."" (Response at 25.) To the extent Sears's Comment seeks clarification on this 
issue as pertaining solely to the credit card market, the court notes that such concerns may be coextensive with the claims 
raised in Visa's and MasterCard's previous ""honor all cards"" litigation. See In re Payment Card Interchange Fee & Merchant 
Discount Antitrust Litig., 562 F. Supp. 2d 392 (E.D.N.Y. 2008) (Gleeson,  [*13] J.); In re Visa Check/Mastermoney Antitrust 
Litig., 297 F. Supp. 2d 503 (E.D.N.Y. 2003) (Gleeson, J.)."
350,3," The ""no-surcharge rules"" prohibited merchants from charging consumers a ""surcharge"" above the normal price of a good for 
using a Visa or MasterCard. "
357,1," This action was originally consolidated with other cases, resulting in eight potential class representatives. Two of these class 
representatives, Harolds Autobody and Flash Sales, Inc., are listed on the docket sheet as plaintiffs but were not mentioned in 
Plaintiffs' Amended Consolidated Class Action Complaint. See Doc. No. 205. Moreover, Defendants indicate that Nu-Parts 
Automotive Products, Inc., although an alleged class representative, ""was never actively involved in this litigation."" Opp. 4 n.4. 
Three other class representatives, Prevatte Auto Supply, DJ's Autobody, and Dynacorn Auto Body Parts, have been voluntarily 
dismissed from the lawsuit after the filing of the class certification motion. See Doc. Nos. 239, 240 (dismissing Prevatte); Nos. 
228, 230 (dismissing Dynacom); and Nos. 231, 234 (dismissing DJ's Autobody). "
359,2," To the extent that Defendants read the quoted language from Wal-Mart Stores as requiring plaintiffs to ""prove common class-
wide injury even at the class certification stage,"" Suppl. 4:4-5, this Court disagrees. Rather, HN6[
] Plaintiffs must show that the 
claims of the class ""depend upon a common contention .... of such a nature that it is capable of classwide resolution — which 
means that determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of the claims in one 
stroke."" Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 180 L. Ed. 2d at 389-90. "
360,3," Defendants dispute whether Plaintiffs have established the existence of a ""pricing structure"" (i.e., ""that the prices paid by 
different purchasers for the same product from a single seller, or for the same product from different sellers, tend to move 
together over time,"" Lamb Rep. ¶ 60), noting that graphs relied on by Plaintiffs' expert show that E-Lite, for example, charged 
""very disperse"" prices to different customers for the same parts. Opp. 31:1-2. Defendants argue that ""[t]he only possible 
explanation for such widespread price dispersion is that Eagle Eyes/E-Lite individually negotiated prices with these customers."" 
Opp. 31:13-14. Nevertheless, as observed by the court in In re Dynamic Random Access Memory Antitrust Litig., 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 39841 
(N.D. Cal. June 5, 2006): In a number of price-fixing cases, courts have certified classes where plaintiffs have alleged that defendants conspired to 
set an artificially inflated base — or ""benchmark"" price — from which all other prices are triggered. See, e.g., In re Vitamins 
Antitrust Litig., 209 F.R.D. at 266; In re Flat Glass Antitrust Litig., 191 F.R.D. at 486;  [**16] In re Potash Antitrust Litig., 159 
F.R.D. 682, 696 n. 19 (D. Minn. 1995); In re Domestic Air Transp. Antitrust Litig., 137 F.R.D. 677, 696 (N.D. Ga. 1991). 
Notably, classes were certified in these cases regardless whether some members of the class negotiated price individually, 
or whether — as here —differences among product type, customer class, and method of purchase existed. See, e.g., In re 
Indus. Diamonds Antitrust Litig., 167 F.R.D. at 383; Arden Architectural Specialties v. Washington Mills Electro Minerals, 
2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21506, 2002 WL 31421915, *9 (W.D. N.Y. 2002). Id. at *47-48. Thus, even if there were instances where class members separately negotiated prices on occasion, it would not 
necessarily preclude class certification. "
363,4," In his initial Report, Dr. Lamb wrote, ""It is my opinion that small changes in the price of aftermarket auto lights would not have 
an impact on the demand for either OEM or recycled/refurbished auto lights."" Lamb Rept. ¶ 46. He further stated, ""This means 
that while aftermarket auto lights might have certain functional substitutes, no economic substitutes exist for them."" Id. 
(emphasis in original). "
370,1," See E.g., Midwestern Waffles, Inc. v. Waffle House, Inc., 734 F.2d 705 (11th Cir. 1984) and Kypta v. McDonald's Corp., 671 
F.2d 1282 (11th Cir. 1982). Both cases involved review of antitrust claims at the summary judgment stage. "
372,2," The Court rejects Astellas's argument, pursuant to Warren Gen. Hosp. v. Amgen, Inc., Case No. 09-cv-4935, 2010 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 56220, 2010 WL 2326254 (D.N.J. June 7, 2010), that Lakeland Regional's allegations are insufficient. In Warren, 
 [*19] the court dismissed the antitrust case pursuant to Illinois Brick because the complaint failed to allege direct purchase, 
alleged that the product at issue was purchased through a wholesaler, and attached to the complaint was a copy of the 
wholesale agreement. In stark contrast, Lakeland Regional's amended complaint does not mention a wholesaler. If it is 
Astellas's position that Lakeland Regional purchases its adenosine product from a wholesaler, Astellas may present that 
argument, along with evidence in support of such argument, in a motion for summary judgment."
372,3," Furthermore, neither Astellas nor Lakeland Regional attempts to categorize the allegations contained in the amended 
complaint as a ""horizontal"" or a ""vertical"" antitrust violation. In Lowell, the Eleventh Circuit indicated that Illinois Brick does not 
apply to certain vertical antitrust conspiracies: ""The inapplicability of Illinois Brick to vertical conspiracies with no allegations of 
pass-on (what some have called the 'vertical conspiracy exception') has long been recognized."" Lowell, 177 F.3d at 1231. "
379,1," Although plaintiff has filed a subsequent amended complaint (doc. 308), the amendment is limited to its Sherman, Robinson-
Patman, RICO and state antitrust claims. As such, the third amended complaint (doc. 308) does not affect the outcome of this 
ruling."

400,7," In De Mankowski, the plaintiff sued defendant for, among other things, cancellation of a contract. Defendant countersued for

defendant on the slander counterclaim. The Galveston Court of Civil Appeals affirmed the jury's award in favor of the defendant 
stating that while ""the statements contained in [the plaintiffs] petition . . . are absolutely privileged and the filing by [the plaintiff] of 
such petition cannot be made the basis of a cause of action for libel or slander [regardless of] how false and malicious such 
statements may be . . . [the defendant's] claim for damages [was] not based upon the bringing of the suit by [the plaintiff], nor

which resulted in extensive publication and harm to the defendant's reputation. The defendant then countersued for defamation. 
A jury found in favor of the defendant on its defamation counterclaim. The Beaumont Court of Appeals affirmed finding that the 
plaintiff's lawsuit was privileged when filed. However, the court went on to cite De Mankowski and observed that because the

obtain exclusion from the lawsuit, how to object, how to attend the court's fairness hearing, and what happens if a class member 
does nothing. It divides these topics into twenty-seven discrete questions that explain the Dean Settlement in even greater 
detail. The Notice also advises each class member of the right to be represented by his or her own lawyer, and the binding effect 
of the Dean Settlement if exclusion is not requested. The Notice directs settlement class members to the website established 
specifically for the Dean Settlement, and to Rust, for further information. Contact information for class counsel is also provided. "
442,3," In Southeastern Milk, litigated in the Eastern District of Tennessee, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants (including Dean 
and Dairy Farmers of America) violated sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act through conspiracy to monopolize and 
monopsonize; unlawful monopsony and unlawful monopolization; attempt to monopolize and monopsonize; and conspiracy to "
443,," price-fix. While the plaintiffs' litigation theories in Southeastern Milk are similar to those in this case, the factual allegations and 
the structure of the Grade A milk market are quite different. The posture of the two cases is also markedly different. The plaintiffs 
in Southeastern Milk have survived a motion to dismiss and a motion for summary judgment.  [*15] Class certification has been 
granted (although a motion is currently pending to decertify the class). Southeastern Milk is on the eve of a jury trial; in this case, 
the parties just completed discovery. "
444,4," In addition to the discovery conducted in this case, Plaintiffs are privy to all of the discovery involving Dean in Southeastern 
Milk. "

used ""as a proxy for market power."" PepsiCo, 315 F.3d at 108."
445,6," Consistent with controlling precedent, the court ruled that DFA and DMS, as non-settling Defendants, lacked standing to 
oppose the Dean Settlement. See Allen v. Dairy Farmers of America, Inc., 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 48479, 2011 WL 1706778, at 
*4 (D.Vt. May 4, 2011) (citing Zupnick v. Fogel, 989 F.2d 93, 98 (2d Cir. 1993) and 4 Alba Conte & Herbert B. Newberg, 
Newberg on Class Actions § 11.55 (4th ed. 2002))."
445,7, The court has not been provided with damages estimates from either Plaintiffs or Dean. 
448,8," Public policy weighs in favor of awarding substantial attorney's fees for incurring the risks of meritorious litigation that redresses 
antitrust violations. At this juncture, no antitrust violations have been found."
448,9," Section 10.5 of the Settlement Agreement provides that ""In no event shall Settling Defendant be obligated to pay anything in 
addition to the Settlement Fund described in paragraph 9.1 hereto, including without limitation class notice costs, attorneys' fees, 
payments to named Plaintiffs for their efforts on behalf of the Settlement Class . . . Except as provided in paragraph 10.6 hereto, 
no  [*38] payment shall be made out of the Settlement Fund prior to the Effective Date, and then, only as approved by the "
449,," Court."" (Doc. 301) (emphasis supplied). Section 10.6 provides: ""Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, any 
disbursement from the Settlement Fund, including disbursements for attorneys' fees, costs and expenses, and incentive fees to 
named Plaintiffs, shall be made only upon approval and order of the Court, and only after the Effective Date."" (Doc. 301) 
(emphasis supplied)."
449,10," In a section entitled ""How will the lawyers be paid?"" the Notice states ""Class Counsel may also request a payment from the 
Settlement Fund for Class Representatives who sued on behalf of the whole Class."" (Doc. 327-3 at 15). The Summary Notice 
states that class counsel will be requesting ""up to one third of the settlement amount ($10 million) in attorneys' fees, plus costs, 
expenses, and incentive fees for the dairy farmers who brought the lawsuit."" (Doc. 327-3 at 7.) "
454,1," This factual background is largely derived from the allegations of the direct purchasers' complaint. Although substantially 
similar, the indirect purchasers' complaint defines the alleged conspiracy  [*14] somewhat differently, and contains some 
additional factual allegations. These differences are discussed further in Section IV B. below. "
455,2," For example, the indirect purchasers' complaint describes how a ""consumer DVD player"" can be designed simply by 
incorporating a ""computer-type"" ODD with a power supply and interface board in a case. Indirect Purchasers' First Amended 
Complaint ¶¶ 82-83. "
456,3," Defendants' joint motion to dismiss uses the term ""Finished ODD products"" similarly, although it is not entirely clear where they 
would categorize the stand-alone devices. Plaintiffs criticize defendants for using a term not found in the complaint, and suggest 
they have mischaracterized the nature of the conspiracy allegations by doing so. Because plaintiffs' definitions conflate products 
made by defendants with those that are not, however, more precise terminology is  [*20] needed. "
457,4," Subsequent to the hearing, the parties have submitted several statements of recent decisions they contend bear on the issues 
in this action. In at least one instance, such a statement was simply filed, in others, they were accompanied by requests for 
leave to submit them, as is required  [*24] by Civil Local Rule 7-3(d). All the statements of recent decision will be deemed 
properly filed. "
458,5," One other somewhat more likely possibility arises. A plaintiff may have purchased an ODD as a replacement for a failed drive 
in an existing ODD device. In such circumstances, the plaintiff would qualify as a direct purchaser."
458,6," Plaintiffs' counsel for the two groups should decide between them which approach is preferable, if the claims are to be pursued. 
Should a modification to the interim appointment order be required, the parties make seek one by stipulation or administrative 
motion brought under Civil Local Rule 7-11. "
459,7," The indirect purchasers' complaint in Cathode Ray also described an economic mechanism whereby the defendants allegedly 
were able to affect the prices charged by third parties for finished products incorporating defendants' CRTs. Id. The direct 
purchasers' complaint here does not include any similar allegations. "
461,8," Of course, as set out above, the Direct Purchaser plaintiffs do not even have standing to pursue claims arising from any bid-
rigging at those auctions. While that does not necessarily foreclose them from pointing to defendants' alleged conduct at those 
auctions as support for the possible existence of a broader agreement to fix prices generally, it does somewhat lessen the 
significance of those allegations. "
462,9," Each of the 29 states is a so-called ""Illinois Brick repealer"" jurisdiction, having by statute or judicial decision expressed a 
determination that standing under that state's law is not to be limited by the rule announced in Illinois Brick. Because Illinois Brick 
addressed federal prudential standing issues, individual states are free to adopt a contrary rule under their own laws. Such state 
statutes and judicial decisions, of course, could not ""repeal"" the Supreme Court's holding in a literal  [*42] sense."
462,10," It may be that at this juncture there could be uncertainty as to whether a particular manufacturer or seller of ODD devices 
constitutes an affiliate or co-conspirator or can only be seen as an independent third party, and therefore it might not be clear 
whether persons who purchased from such entities are potential members of a direct purchaser class or an indirect purchaser 
class. Any such questions will have to be resolved eventually, because a person who purchased an ODD device from a 
particular entity should either be deemed a direct purchaser or an indirect purchaser as to that  [*43] particular purchase, but not 
both. "
463,11," Although  [*49] not every non-""repealer"" state necessarily elected to follow Illinois Brick through a conscious balancing of 
policy interests, at least some have. See Vacco v. Microsoft Corp., 260 Conn. 59, 793 A.2d 1048, 1059-60 (Conn. 2002) (noting 
that Connecticut's legislature has declined several times to enact bills that would have provided for an Illinois Brick ""repealer""). "
468,1," Contemporaneously with the filing of the notice of removal, Sabre filed a Notice of Related Case notifying the court of the 
pendency of the action on the docket of Judge Means. "
469,2," Case No. 4:11-CV-244-Y was initiated on April 12, 2011, by American's filing of a complaint naming three defendants. None of 
the Sabre companies was named. Sabre filed a motion to intervene in the action on June 1, 2011. By an amended complaint 
filed June 9, 2011, American added Sabre as defendants. Among other things, American complained in the amended complaint 
of anti-competitive conduct of Sabre and the other defendants in violation  [*7] of sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 
U.S.C. §§ 1-2. On July 13, 2011, Sabre filed a motion to dismiss American's complaint, as amended, for failure to state a claim 
upon which relief could be granted. "
471,3," In Waste Control Specialists v. Envirocare, 199 F.3d 781 (5th Cir.), modified in part, 207 F.3d 225 (5th Cir. 2000), the Fifth 
Circuit reversed the district court's denial of a motion to remand an action brought in state court under the TFEAA. The Fifth 
Circuit explained: Although WCS could have alleged a federal cause of action in its state petition, it did not. It filed a complaint in state court 
alleging wholly state claims in a non-preempted field. Its choice is entitled to respect and precluded removing the case to 
federal court absent circumstances not presented here. Id. at 784. In addition to ordering the district court to remand the action, the Fifth Circuit ordered the district court to award the 
plaintiff costs and fees pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1447(c) upon submission of proper proof. Id. at 788."
471,4," In Bennett v. Southwest Airlines Co., 484 F.3d 907, 912 (7th Cir. 2007), the Seventh Circuit in effect rejected the line of 
reasoning advanced by Grable, saying ""[t]hat some standards of care used in tort litigation come from federal law does not make 
the tort claim one 'arising under' federal law."" "
472,5," In Valdes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., the Fifth Circuit said: ""To be sure, the district court may award fees even if removal is made 
in subjective good faith."" 199 F.3d 290, 292 (5th Cir. 2000)."
472,6," Sabre's argument that the fact that counsel for American anticipated the possibility that Sabre might seek a removal of the 
action provides evidence  [*20] of the objective reasonableness of the removal is not persuasive. The court has no way of 
knowing why counsel for American anticipated Sabre's conduct, but the court is satisfied that whatever caused them to have that 
foresight does not cause Sabre's removal conduct to be objectively reasonable. "
479,*," The Honorable David R. Herndon, Chief Judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Illinois, sitting by

484,1," The district court also found summary judgment warranted on the ""separate and independent"" ground that Multiut failed to offer 
evidence of its damages stemming from the alleged breach. We need not address that ground here. "
488,2," HN18[
] There are three categories of 2 competitive injury that may give rise to Robinson-Patman Act claims: ""primary line,"" 
""secondary line,"" and ""tertiary line."" Primary-line cases involve price discrimination that injures competition at the level of the 
discriminating seller and its direct competitors. Secondary-line cases like this one involve price discrimination that injures 
competition among customers of the discriminating seller. Tertiary-line cases involve injury to competition among the customers 
of the differently treated purchasers. Volvo Trucks N. Am., Inc. v. Reeder-Simco GMC, Inc., 546 U.S. 164, 176, 126 S. Ct. 860, 
163 L. Ed. 2d 663 (2006). "
497,1," While plaintiffs are no longer in business and are unable to directly benefit from an injunction, here, an injunction is appropriate 
because of the public's interest in robust competition and the possibility that plaintiffs may one day reenter the market. "
501,1," The statement of facts assumes all the allegations of the Counterclaim are true and construes inferences from such facts in 
Defendant-Counterclaimant's favor. See Regions Bank v. Reg'l Prop. Dev. Corp., 2008 NCBC ¶¶40-41 (N.C. Super. Ct. Apr. 21, 
2008).  [**5]"
501,2," The Settlement Agreement defined RJRT to include Reynolds Innovations Inc. (""RII""), a trademark holding company and 
subsidiary of RJRT. Likewise, this Order includes RII within the term RJRT where appropriate."
501,3," The parties variously use the terms ""pleasure"" and ""PLEASURE."" The Court understands that the distinction between the two 
is not relevant to the current controversy."
501,4," RJRT incorporated the Settlement Agreement into its Counterclaim by attaching as an ""Exhibit 1"" so it is properly considered 
as part of the pleadings for purposes of this Motion. See Oberlin Capital, L.P. v. Slavin, 147 N.C. App. 52, 60, 554 S.E. 2d 840, 
847 (2001). "
502,5," The Court has accepted for purposes of the present Motion that each of RJRT's uses of the term ""pleasure"" of which Lorillard 
complains is as a part of a ""composite phrase."" However, this does not necessarily  [**9] end the inquiry. The Settlement 
Agreement provides that the use of ""the term PLEASURE alone"" means that it is both in a composite phrase and not in a 
manner creating a commercial impression associating the term alone with the brand name of a tobacco product. (Countercl. ¶ 
21.)"
502,6, (See Defendant's Mem. In Opp'n to Pls.' Mot. to Dismiss and Mot. to Strike 20 n.6.) 
503,7," The federal Noerr-Pennington Doctrine arose under the federal Sherman Act, on which certain provisions of Chapter 75 are 
modeled, whereas Chapter 75-1.1 was based on Section 5 of the FTC Act."
503,8," However, because the suit was not filed for a legitimate purpose, the court found that the defendant remained exposed to 
liability for tortious interference with contract  [**17] claims because there is ""no relation"" between the state tort and ""legislative 
intent behind federal anti-trust law."" Reichhold Chems., Inc., 146 N.C. App. at 148, 555 S.E.2d at 288. "
504,9," Without citing Reichhold, another North Carolina federal district court held that ""parties bringing or threatening to bring 
meritorious, good faith claims cannot by definition be subject to liability under [Section 75-1.1]. As such, parties bringing good

507,1," CRT Products are defined in the settlement agreement  [*3] to mean Cathode Ray Tubes of any type (e.g. color display tubes, 
color picture tubes and monochrome display tubes) and products containing Cathode Ray Tubes. "
508,2," The Net Settlement Fund means the $10,000,000 settlement amount, plus interest, minus 25% for attorneys' fees, 
reimbursement of expenses, $2.5 million for a costs set-aside,  [*8] including the costs of giving notice to class members and 
administration of the settlement fund, all of which shall be subject to court approval. The Net Settlement Fund shall be no less 
than $5 million. "
512,1," The facts are taken from Loren Data's initial complaint (ECF No. 1) and the supplemental statement of facts in the amended 
complaint. (ECF No. 13). "

interconnects with GXS to enter into an agreement with Loren Data that is similar to Loren Data's current agreement with Inovis."" 
(ECF No. 13 ¶ k). No further details are alleged to indicate how, when, or to whom this intention was conveyed or how GXS 
intends to carry out its intent. This allegation is far from adequate to allege an illegal boycott or any other form of conspiracy to 
restrain trade. "

injunctive relief, in any court of the United States having jurisdiction over the parties, . . . ."" 15 U.S.C. §26. "
541,5," In addition, the Court notes that throughout the complaint, Black continuously refers to ""Defendants"" without differentiating 
between which of the Defendants or categories of Defendants allegedly engaged in the specific conduct. It cannot be assumed 
that all of the Defendants engaged in all of the alleged conduct given that there are distinct differences in their businesses. The 
Court further notes that many of Plaintiff's allegations do not describe conduct engaged in specifically by the named Defendants 
in this action, but rather, are stated in more theoretical terms, describing generally conduct engaged in by all consumer lenders, 
credit bureaus and credit scoring companies. With these caveats in mind, the Court turns to the factual allegations in the 
Complaint."
541,6," Plaintiff does not allege that she holds or held any other type of consumer loan with the Lenders, such as a home mortgage 
loan or home equity loan or line of credit, and she distinguishes interest rates for consumer lending from interest rates on 
""lending in other markets including home and business loans."" (Compl., ¶ 69.)"
541,7," According to Plaintiff, the other entities making the list of top ten consumer lenders are Citi, American Express, Capital 
 [*12] One, Wells Fargo, HSBC, U.S. Bank, and USAA Savings. (Compl., ¶ 63.) "
542,8," Defendants Experian, Trans Union, Equifax, VantageScore and FICO join in the motion to dismiss and supporting brief filed by 
Defendants JPMorgan and BOA and incorporate their arguments by reference. "
543,9," For purposes of the pending motions to dismiss, only the first and third elements are at issue. "
545,10," ""Baby Bells"" refers to the regional telephone monopolies created in the wake of the 1984 divestiture of the American 
Telephone & Telegraph Company. Id. at 548."
545,11," The Court disregarded the few stray statements that spoke directly of an agreement, finding that they constituted legal 
conclusions. Id. at 564. "
546,12," The page references to Plaintiff's memoranda in opposition to the Defendants' motions to dismiss are to the ECF page number 
on the top of the documents, as Plaintiff has failed to number the individual pages of her briefs. "
547,13," With  [*33] regard to Plaintiff's allegations of parallel conduct, even if the Court assumes, for purposes of the motion to 
dismiss, that all lenders have adopted the same consistent pricing system, that fact alone does not nudge the Complaint across 
the line from possibility to plausibility of entitlement to relief. As explained below, Plaintiff must allege some further circumstance 
pointing toward a meeting of the minds to fix the price of loans in order to cross that line. Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556-57."
547,14," Plaintiff also advances the argument that to the extent Defendants are contending that the Complaint is insufficient for not 
using the magic language of ""agreement,"" but instead pleads ""conspiracy,"" Defendants ignore the plain meaning of the word 
conspiracy and, in any event, there is no requirement in the case law that the term ""agreement"" be used to properly plead an 
antitrust violation. The Court does not construe Defendants' argument to be making any such distinction. Indeed, Defendants 
clear up any confusion on this point in their Reply Memorandum. (Reply Mem. of Law in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss (""Lenders' 
Reply Mem."")  [*37] at 2 n. 2, ECF No. 66.) "
548,15, The letters from JP Morgan are attached to Plaintiff's Complaint as Exhibit A. 
549,16," Plaintiff's argument misses the mark for another reason. Direct evidence is evidence which requires no inferences to establish 
the asserted proposition, but is explicit on its face. InterVest, 340 F.3d at 159 (citation omitted). By asking the Court to infer an 
agreement from the  [*44] text of the letters, Plaintiff appears to be conceding that the letters do not constitute direct evidence of 
an agreement. "
550,17," The Supreme Court in Twombly noted that several commentators provided HN21[
] examples of parallel conduct allegations 
that would be sufficient to state a §1 claim under its newly enunciated plausibility standard, which included ""parallel behavior that 
would probably not result from chance, coincidence, independent responses to common stimuli, or mere interdependence 
unaided by an advance understanding among the parties,"" or ""conduct [that] indicates the sort of restricted freedom of action 
and sense of obligation that one generally associates with agreement"". 550 U.S. at 556 n. 4 (citations omitted). In addition, the "
551,," parties in Twombly, ""agree[d]  [*51] that 'complex and historically unprecedented changes in pricing structure made at the very 
same time by multiple competitors, and made for no other discernible reason' would support a plausible inference of conspiracy."" 
Id. In the case at bar, the allegations of parallelism do not describe conduct that falls within any of these examples. Indeed, as 
noted below, the parallelism asserted here at best resulted from mere interdependence unaided by an advance understanding 
among the parties."
551,18," The Court's focus on communications between Defendants is appropriate given Plaintiff's argument in her brief to the effect 
that the parallel conduct of Defendants is based on their communications with each other regarding their customers. Pl.'s Mem. 
in Opp'n at 8, ECF No. 63."
551,19," In paragraph 72 of her Complaint, Plaintiff is asserting essentially that the letters she received from JP Morgan indicate JP 
Morgan changed its position on her credit line due to cooperation, understanding, and agreement among competitors, rather 
than independent market factors, and thus prove that JP Morgan used competitively sensitive information obtained from other 
yet to be identified lenders to set prices, foreclose credit  [*52] lines, and accelerate default. Compl., ¶ 72."
551,20," The court of appeals decision in Michelman is discussed in more detail in Part 3, infra, at 37-38. "
552,21," The excerpt from FICO's website attached as Exhibit C to ECF No. 63 states that the FICO scores give lenders ""insight into 
[their] own customers' risk and revenue potential, and . . . updated scores . . . [can be] us[ed] to make more profitable decisions 
for credit line management, cross-selling, balance building, pricing,  [*55] customer retention, activation, collections resource 
allocation and point-of-sale authorizations."" See ECF No. 63-3. "
553,22," The factual allegations in those paragraphs can be distilled essentially as follows: Credit scores are lowered when a consumer 
pays off a credit card. Lenders use the lowered credit score to increase the interest rate (and thus the price), even though such 
payoffs actually increase a consumers' creditworthiness and decrease risk to all of the lenders. "
554,23, The Supreme Court issued its decision in Maple Flooring the same day it decided Cement Manufacturers. 
556,24," Plaintiff submits that the ""term 'credit score' is simply a euphemism for pricing point"", Pl.'s Mem. in Opp'n at 12, ECF No. 63, 
but fails to cite any authority for this proposition, most likely because none exists."
556,25," Plaintiff also attempts to distinguish the Supreme Court's decision in Maple Flooring on the basis that the data exchanged in 
that case was aggregate statistical data, which did not identify individual customers, much less a pricing score. However, 
Plaintiff's attempt falls short as no pricing information was exchanged here and the identities of the customers was not 
dispositive. Plaintiff also cites Container  [*72] Corp. in support of her argument that Cement Manufacturers and Maple Flooring 
are not applicable where ""'each defendant on receiving . . . [a price request] usually furnished the data with the expectation that 
is would be furnished reciprocal information when it wanted it. That concerted action is of course sufficient to establish the 
combination or conspiracy, the initial ingredient of a violation of § 1 of the Sherman Act.'"" Pl.'s Mem. in Opp'n at 17 n. 3, ECF No. 
63 (quoting Container Corp., 393 U.S. 333, 89 S. Ct. 510, 21 L. Ed. 2d 526 (1969)). Plaintiff's reliance on Container Corp. is 
misplaced. Unlike the exchange in that case, here there was no exchange of pricing information, a critical fact, nor do the factual 
allegations here show or suggest an understanding or expectation of a reciprocal exchange of pricing information."
556,26," Essentially, the business practice challenged by Plaintiff as violating federal antitrust laws can be summarized as follows. 
Lenders report negative events (such as late payments, exceeding credit limits/too high balances, default, arrearages, and 
foreclosures), as they occur in their customers' accounts, to credit bureaus which compile credit histories and provide that 
information to credit scoring companies, who in turn use that information, along with algorithms, to convert this information into a 
credit score. The recalculated credit scores are then distributed via the credit bureaus to the lenders, which use the recalculated 
credit scores to adjust their customers' credit terms/limits."
556,27," Upon request, the Antitrust Division will issue a business review letter pursuant to 28 C.F.R. §50.6 stating the Department's 
antitrust enforcement intentions with regard to the requesting organization's proposed business operation. "
557,28," Nor does the credit information provided by the lenders to the credit bureaus constitute ""pricing information"" or ""credit terms."" 
The information provided by lenders consist of events that relate to a customer's creditworthiness—i.e., untimely repayment, 
high outstanding loan balances, loan default, arrearages, foreclosures, etc. This creditworthiness information is not a pricing 
point or model. "
559,29," At  [*87] its very essence, the credit score is a predictor of a borrower's risk of default. It is touted by VantageScore as a 
""highly predictive, generic consumer credit risk model . . . [that p]redicts the likelihood of future serious delinquencies (90 days 
late or greater) on any type of account."" VANTAGESCORE, http://www.vantagescore.com/about/vantagescore_methodology/ (last 
visited 8/09/11). According to VantageScore's website, credit scores are used by lenders to determine whether to extend credit 
and the terms of such credit. Id., http://www.vantagescore.com/benefits/consumers/ (last visited 8/09/11). A consumer's 
VantageScore is derived from a mathematical formula that evaluates a number of credit-related characteristics, including: "

history, 
credit 
utilization, 
depth 
of 
credit, 
balances, 
recent 
credit, 
and 
available 
credit. 
Id., http://www.vantagescore.com/faqs/consumer/ (last visited 8/09/11). Along with the credit score, lenders also consider a number 
of other factors including whether a borrower is likely to improve, deteriorate, or remain stable in terms of their credit score by 
closely examining credit reports, specifically, the amount of credit utilization. The Score, VANTAGESCORE at 5 (Apr. 26, 2011),

561,31," In Fletcher-Harlee, the version of Rule 15 in effect at the time of the court of appeals' decision  [*94] was the pre-2009 
amendment version, which allowed a plaintiff to amend a complaint once as a matter of right up to the point at which the district 
court grants the motion to dismiss and enters final judgment, since a motion to dismiss is not a responsive pleading and the time 
limit applied only to responsive pleadings. After the motion to dismiss is granted and final judgment is entered, a plaintiff may 
seek to amend the complaint only through Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) or 60(b). Id. (citing Kelly, supra). "
562,32," The Court finds that as to the allegations contained in paragraphs 32-35 of the Complaint, ""because they are no more than 
conclusions, [they] are not entitled to the assumption of truth."" Iqbal, 129 S.Ct. at 1950. In some instances, Plaintiff combines a 
conclusion with a hypothesis or theory not directed to any named defendant. See Compl. ¶33 (""Market associations can be 
effective tools for monopolizing industries by acting as an information clearing house for coordinating pricing information and 
boycotts.""); see also Compl. ¶35 (""Because the database information is shared in real time, the lenders can increase prices or 
institute boycotts  [*99] with unparalleled efficiency.""). Moreover, other than the reference to Equifax in the JP Morgan letters, "
563,," there are no facts alleged in the Complaint suggesting communications between the Bureau Defendants and the other 
Defendants, that support the allegation in paragraph 34 that the ""credit bureau(s) alert all of the lenders to either boycott the 
debtor by foreclosing access to any further loans or increase interest rates."" In addition, the reference to Equifax in the JP 
Morgan letters does not give rise to the suggestion or inference that the Equifax alerted JP Morgan to boycott Plaintiff by 
foreclosing access to any further loans or increase interest rates. Rather, the JP Morgan letters indicate that Equifax merely 
provided credit information to JPMorgan. See discussion, supra, at 22-24. "
564,33," However, where it has been demonstrated that the corporate form has been abused, courts will allow the corporate veil to be 
pierced and liability imposed on the corporation's shareholders. Pearson, 247 F.3d at 484 (citing Publicker Indus., Inc. v. Roman 
Ceramics Corp., 603 F2d. 1065, 1069 (3d Cir. 1979)). In making this determination, the courts apply the ""alter ego"" test, which 
requires an inquiry into whether the subsidiary is little more than a legal fiction, and consideration of the following factors: ""gross 
undercapitalization,  [*106] failure to observe corporate formalities, nonpayment of dividends, insolvency of debtor corporation, 
siphoning of funds from the debtor corporation by the dominant stockholder, nonfunctioning of officers and directors, absence of 
corporate records, and whether the corporation is merely a facade for the operations of the dominant stockholder."" Id. at 484-85 
(citing Am. Bell Inc. v. Fed'n of Tel. Workers of Pa., 736 F.2d 879, 886 (3d Cir. 1984)). Plaintiff's Complaint does not contain any 
factual allegations even remotely suggesting any of the alter ego factors are present here."
564,34," VantageScore is a Delaware limited liability company, and is owned by the three Bureau Defendants, two of which are 
corporations (Experian and Equifax), and the other (Trans Union) is a Delaware limited liability company. Compl., ¶¶ 7-9, 11. "
566,35," Moreover, Fair Isaac is not even relevant to the instant dispute as Fair Isaac did not involve an antitrust claim, but rather, 
claims of unfair competition, false advertising under Lanham Act, misappropriation of trade secrets, breach of contract, and 
interference with contract."
566,36," Plaintiff also quotes from a document she describes as the Bureau Defendants' Response in Opposition  [*115] to Plaintiff's 
Motion to Compel, but no such document is found in the record at Western District of Pennsylvania, Docket No. 2:10-cv-848. Nor 
does Plaintiff provide a citation for the quoted material. Without a proper cite identify the source of the quote, the Court declines 
to consider the quoted material."
566,37," Plaintiff submits that she has presented actual evidence from which a conspiracy can be inferred with regard to Experian. 
Plaintiff points to the JP Morgan letters (attached as Exhibit A to the Complaint) which identify Equifax, not Experian, as the 
credit reporting agency who provided information upon which JP Morgan relied in making its decision to reduce the credit limit on 
Plaintiff's account. However, as discussed supra with regard to the Lender Defendants' motion to dismiss, the credit reporting 
agency's conduct was authorized by the FCRA, and therefore, entirely lawful. Therefore, the  [*117] Court finds a conspiracy 
cannot be inferred from this ""actual evidence"" against any of the Bureau Defendants. "
568,38," Plaintiff incorporates her argument on this issue advanced in her brief in opposition to the Lender Defendants' motion to 
dismiss.  [*124] The Court notes that the Lender Defendants merely cited Credit Suisse for the proposition that allowing Plaintiff 
to predicate her antitrust conspiracy claim on factual allegations that Defendants did precisely what Congress has authorized 
them to do would be plainly repugnant to the language and purpose of the FCRA, and thus, did not advance the argument that 
the FCRA impliedly precluded application of antitrust laws to this case. See discussion supra at 45 (citing Lender' Mem. at 14-
15, ECF No. 34). Nonetheless, Plaintiff presented an argument opposing application of an implied antitrust exemption in her 
memorandum in opposition to the Lender Defendants' motion to dismiss at 21-23 (ECF No. 63), which she incorporates by 
reference in her memorandum in opposition to the Bureau Defendants' motion to dismiss."

572,45," Section 12 of the Clayton Act, codified at 15 U.S.C. §22, provides: HN45[
] Any suit, action, or proceeding under the antitrust laws against a corporation may be brought not only in the 
judicial district whereof it is an inhabitant, but also in any district wherein it may be found or transacts business; and all 
process in such cases may be served in the district  [*139] of which it is an inhabitant, or wherever it may be found. (Emphasis added.) The nationwide service of process provision in Section 12 of the Clayton Act applies to cases brought 
pursuant to Section 1 of the Sherman Act. See 15 U.S.C. §12 and Historical & Stat. Notes thereto (defining antitrust laws to 
include sections 1 through 7 of Title 15, known as the Sherman Act). "

574,47," Dunn also attests that VantageScore does not otherwise engage in any of these activities. Dunn Decl., ¶4. "
576,48," The Court notes that Plaintiff filed a Sur-Reply Brief in Opposition to VantageScore's Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. 76) to which 
she could have attached documentation of the alleged purchase of her VantageScore® credit score from her home computer in 
Pennsylvania  [*156] or an affidavit, yet she failed to attach any such evidence. "
577,49," See discussion supra at 60-61 rejecting Plaintiff's attempt to predicate the Bureau Defendants' liability on an alleged agency 
relationship with VantageScore."
577,50," VantageScore notes in its reply brief that technically it does not license its patent, but rather, it is the assignee of the patent. 
(VantageScore's Reply Br. at 3, ECF No. 69 & Ex. 1 at 2, ECF No. 69-1.) "
579,51," Justice O'Connor explained her application of the stream of commerce theory as follows: The ""substantial connection"" between the defendant and the forum State necessary for a finding  [*167] of minimum 
contacts must come about by an action of the defendant purposefully directed toward the forum State. The placement of a 
product into the stream of commerce, without more, is not an act of the defendant purposefully directed toward the forum 
State. Asahi, 480 U.S. at 112 (internal citations omitted)."
579,52," Justice Brennan opined that ""jurisdiction premised on the placement of a product into the stream of commerce [without more] 
is consistent with the Due Process Clause[.]"" He went on to explain that ""[a]s long as a participant in this process is aware that 
the final product is being marketed in the forum State, the possibility of a lawsuit there cannot come as a surprise."" 480 U.S. at 
117 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment)."
579,53," At oral argument on the motions to dismiss, Plaintiff argued that it was ""absolutely foreseeable"" that the VantageScore® was 
going to end up in Pennsylvania. Tr. of Mots. Proceedings on 2/10/11 at 70, ECF No. 82. To the extent her argument is based 
on a foreseeability test, Plaintiff ignores the court of appeals opinion in D'Jamoos finding that foreseeability alone is insufficient 
to establish personal  [*169] jurisdiction under the Due Process Clause."
579,54," The court of appeals further noted that the stream of commerce theory provides no basis for exercising general jurisdiction 
over a non-resident defendant, but rather only applies to the exercise of specific jurisdiction. D'Jamoos, 566 F.3d at 106 (citing 
Purdue Research Found. v. Sanofi-Synthelabo, S.A., 338 F.3d 773, 788 (7th Cir. 2003); Bearry v. Beech Aircraft Corp., 818 F.2d 
370, 375 (5th Cir. 1987)). "
580,55," The district court in Primesource held that because the defendant did not manufacture or sell any products, but merely gave its 
licensees the right to sue the patented technology to manufacture their own products under the defendant's brand name without 
the risk of being sued by defendant, such a covenant not to sue was not a product sold in the stream of commerce. 2007 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 98971, 2008 WL 779906, at *5."
580,56," At oral argument, Plaintiff's counsel likened the situation between VantageScore and the credit reporting companies  [*172] to 
that of a manufacturer and distributor, and argued that VantageScore manufactured the score and as owner of the product and 
ultimately the license, they controlled where the product goes in commerce. Tr. of Mots. Proceedings on 2/10/11 at 70, ECF No. 
82. Plaintiff's argument is without merit as the uncontroverted evidence shows that VantageScore is neither the manufacturer nor 
seller of the credit scores sold by the three credit reporting agencies."
580,57," As further support for its argument that this Court lacks personal jurisdiction over it, VantageScore points to Judge Conti's 
ruling during a motion hearing in Schweitzer v. Equifax Information Solutions LLC, Fair Isaac Corporation and VantageScore 
Solutions LLC, docketed at Civil Action No. 2:08-cv-00478, in this district, where Judge Conti granted VantageScore's motion to 
dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. See Minute Entry dated 7/14/2008, W.D.Pa. Docket No. 2:08-cv-00478. However, 
without the benefit of an opinion detailing the reasons for Judge Conti's ruling, this Court declines to accord her ruling any weight 
in this case. And, in any event, this Court is not bound by the decision of another district court judge in an unrelated case. The 
complaint  [*174] in Schweitzer asserted claims against all defendants under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. §1681 et "
581,," seq., and a state common law negligence claim. The Court notes that unlike the Sherman Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act 
does not contain a statutory provision allowing nationwide service of process. Korzeniowski v. NCO Financial Systems, No. 
3:09-cv-1399 (WWE), 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10437, 2010 WL 466162, *2 (D. Conn. Feb. 8, 2010). "
584,58," In the alternative, Plaintiff summarily requests leave to amend her complaint. (Pl's Mem. in Opp'n to VantageScore at 11, 
 [*186] ECF No. 64.) The Court recommends that Plaintiff's request be denied for the same reasons set forth with regard to the 
same request in her briefs in opposition to the motions to dismiss filed by the Lender Defendants and Bureau Defendants. See 
discussion supra at 51-53, 70. "
587,1," Both experts are highly qualified. Dr. Leitzinger has a Ph.D. in economics from the University of California, Los Angeles. He is 
the president and founder of Econ One Research, Inc. and has offered expert opinions regarding class certification in similar 
cases that address alleged exclusion of generic competition in the pharmaceutical market. See, e.g., Am. Sales Co. v. 
SmithKline Beecham Corp., 274 F.R.D. 127 (E.D. Pa. 2010). Dr. Andrew Joskow has a Ph.D. in economics from Yale 
University. He was the chief economist for the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice. He is now Senior Vice President at 
National Economic Research Associates, Inc. "
588,2," PDC seeks to certify a class of 35 members of the putative class. The proposed class members include 34 pharmaceutical 
wholesalers as well as the Ohio Department of Mental Health. As the Court discusses below, two of these proposed class 
members, Allied Med Wholesale Drug, Co. and Goodwin Drug Co., did not purchase any generic extended-release bupropion 
hydrochloride after it became available. The Court concludes that it is appropriate to limit the class definition to direct purchasers 
who purchased extended-release bupropion hydrochloride after it became available. "
590,3," The elements of a charge of conspiracy to monopolize under  [*19] section 2 of the Sherman Act are (1) an agreement 
between two or more economic entities; (2) a specific intent to monopolize the relevant market; (3) the commission of an overt 
act in furtherance of the alleged conspiracy; and (4) that there was a dangerous probability of success. 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
21286, [WL] at *4. The elements of a section 2 monopolization claim are (1) the possession of monopoly power and (2) the willful acquisition and 
maintenance of that power as distinguished from growth or development or consequences of a superior product, business 
acumen, or historical accident. Crossroads Cogeneration Corp. v. Orange & Rockland Utils., 159 F.3d 129, 141 (3d Cir. 1998). The elements of restraint of trade in violation of section 1 of the Sherman act are (1) the defendant was a party to a ""contract, 
combination ... or conspiracy"" and (2) the conspiracy to which the defendant was a party imposed an unreasonable restraint on 
trade. Toledo Mack Sales & Serv., Inc. v. Mack Trucks, Inc., 530 F.3d 204, 218 (3d Cir. 2008) (internal quotation omitted). "
591,4," The Court notes the difference between antitrust impact and the calculation of damages. ""In antitrust and securities fraud class 
actions, '[p]roof of injury (whether or not an injury occurred at all) must be distinguished from calculation of damages (which 
determines the actual value of the injury).'"" Hydrogen Peroxide, 552 F.3d at 311 (quoting Newton v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, 
Fenner & Smith, Inc., 259 F.3d 154, 188 (3d Cir. 2001)). The Supreme Court has explained that plaintiffs under § 4 of the 
Clayton Act must prove ""injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flows from that which makes the 
defendants' acts unlawful."" Cargill, Inc. v. Monfort of Colo., Inc., 479 U.S. 104, 109, 107 S. Ct. 484, 93 L. Ed. 2d 427 (1986)

593,5," To the extent that the defendants' quality perception arguments relate to the amount of damages instead of the existence of 
antitrust impact, the Court will address that issue below. See Joskow Dep. Feb. 15, 2011 at 46-47 (referring to quality perception 
issues ""as mostly a damages issue.""). "
597,6," See also id. at 374 (quoting ABA Section of Antitrust Law, Proving Antitrust Damages 193-94 (1996) (""Where a group of 
suppliers conspires to . . . prevent a more efficient supplier from entering the market . . . purchasers from the  [*45] conspirators 
would also have antitrust claims because they pay higher prices as a result of the exclusionary practice. The purchasers' 
damages would be based on the overcharge they paid measured by the difference between the price actually paid and the price 
that would have been paid absent collusion, multiplied by the quantity."")."
597,7," This methodology has been used in similar cases that allege unlawful delay of generic competition. See, e.g., Neurontin, 2011

Association et al. v. WellPoint, Inc. (CV 09-6725 PSG (FFMx)). "
621,4," The WellPoint Defendants offer several  [**25] declarations and exhibits to accompany their Rule 12(b)(1) factual attack on the 
pleadings. Pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1), a party may move to dismiss a case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. When a 
defendant brings a factual attack upon subject matter jurisdiction, the Court may consider extrinsic evidence, weigh the 
evidence, and resolve factual disputes. See Roberts v. Corrothers, 812 F.2d 1173, 1177 (9th Cir. 1987). The plaintiff bears the 
burden of establishing subject matter jurisdiction. See Valdez v. United States, 56 F.3d 1177, 1179 (9th Cir. 1995). Until the 
plaintiff proves otherwise, federal jurisdiction is presumed to be lacking. See Stock West, Inc. v. Confederated Tribes of the 
Colville Reservation, 873 F.2d 1221, 1225 (9th Cir. 1989). In their Objections and Request to Strike, Plaintiffs argue that factual 
attacks can only be entertained after the filing of an answer. See Reply to Opp. to Pls.' Objs. and Request to Strike 2:23-27 
(citing Mortensen v. First Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass'n, 549 F.2d 884, 892 n.17 (3d Cir. 1977)). However, as noted by WellPoint 
Defendants, the Mortensen dictum relating to the timing of a Rule 12(b)(1) factual attack has been clearly rejected.  [**26] See 
Berardi v. Swanson Mem. Lodge No. 48 of the Fraternal Order of Police, 920 F. 2d 198, 200 (3d Cir. 1990) (""Long before 
Mortensen, the Supreme Court made clear that a facially sufficient complaint may be dismissed before an answer is served if it 
can be shown by affidavits that subject matter jurisdiction is lacking.""). The gist of these declarations is that the reimbursement 
rates of several Plaintiffs' ONS were not determined according to UCR rates. As such, the WellPoint Defendants argue that 
these Plaintiffs lack standing. The Court is satisfied that these declarations were made with personal knowledge, that the 
exhibits were properly authenticated, see Fed. R. Evid. 901(a), and that the attached insurance policies are not hearsay, see 
Stuart v. UNUM Life Ins. Co. of Am., 217 F.3d 1145, 1154 (9th Cir. 2000) (finding that an insurance policy was ""excluded from 
the definition of hearsay and is admissible evidence because it is a legally operative document that defines the rights and 
liabilities of the parties in this case""). Accordingly, to the extent that the Court relies upon the declarations offered in support of 
Defendants' motion, the Court OVERRULES Plaintiffs' objections  [**27] and DENIES their Motion to Strike. "
624,5," WellPoint Defendants also argue that the Samsells cannot assert any of the claims in the Complaint because they are 
contractually time barred. See Mot. 53:16-22. The contract provision attached to Defendants' declaration says that ""[n]o action 
can be brought after three years from the time written proof has been given to [Defendants]."" See Ward Decl., Ex. A, Art. VII, ¶ 
GG. Defendants suggest that the last time the Samsells provided ""written proof"" was in May 2005, beyond the three year period, 
Reply 27:14, but it is unclear what ""written proof"" means in the provision provided. As a result, Defendants' motion to dismiss the 
Samsells'  [**37] claims as untimely is DENIED. The Court notes that Plaintiffs raise the issue of fraudulent concealment in 
response to WellPoint Defendants' argument to dismiss the Samsells' claims as untimely. Opp'n 60:15-16. That argument is 
limited to Plaintiffs' Opposition, however, and without factual support in the Complaint, the Court cannot consider it."
624,6," WellPoint Defendants further contend that the Association Plaintiffs also lack individual standing to pursue their RICO and 
Sherman Act claims. See Mot. 52:15-20. However, the  [**40] Association Plaintiffs have alleged a direct injury to their business 
in the form of increased counseling expenses. SAC ¶ 169. "
634,7," In their Opposition to Defendants' Motion to Dismiss, Plaintiffs argue that even if the statements in the explanation of benefits 
and other mailed documents were not false or misleading themselves, they still satisfy wire or mail fraud because they were part 
of the larger fraudulent scheme to depress prices. See Opp'n. 25:9-26:10. The Complaint, however, only alleges that WellPoint 
Defendants sent subscribers and providers ""materially false and misleading"" explanations of benefits or other statements. See 
SAC ¶¶ 305-09. The Court will not read into the Complaint what is not there. "
635,8," The other Provider Plaintiffs provide similarly detailed factual allegations of the alleged false or misleading statements. See 
RICO Case Statement 27-114. Further, the Association Plaintiffs also assert RICO claims, but neither the WellPoint nor UHG 
Defendants' make any argument as to why the RICO mail and wire fraud predicate act allegations are insufficient as to them. 
Thus, the Court need not consider that issue in this Order. "

642,13," The Parties do not address the extent to which state law differs with respect to the breach of contract claim. Because 
WellPoint Defendants do not move to dismiss on those grounds, the Court does not address them. "
649,1," The FACC does not indicate whether Yardi was successful at recapturing Client 2's business or if Client 2 remained with 
RealPage. "
650,2," To the extent the Court relies on any documents not attached directly to the FACC, those documents are mentioned in the 
FACC and are thereby incorporated by reference. Furthermore, ""[a] trial court may presume that public records are authentic 
and trustworthy,"" Gilbrook v. City of Westminster, 177 F.3d 839, 858 (9th Cir. 1999), and, thus, fall within the purview of Federal 
Rule of Evidence 201. See Lee v. City of L.A., 250 F.3d 668, 688 (9th Cir. 2001)."
650,3," Yardi does not bring any argument in the instant Motion against RealPage's first claim for misappropriation of trade secrets. In 
light of the allegations levied against Yardi for willfully and maliciously misappropriating RealPage's trade secrets by means of 
Hendrix, (see FACC ¶¶ 51-57), and because Yardi failed to provide any argument to the contrary, this claim survives the Motion 
to Dismiss."
650,4," While the FACC merely states in a head note that RealPage is bringing its third counterclaim under the California Cartwright 
Act, it does not allege any specific section under the Act. (FACC at 28.) Therefore, the Court is forced to rely upon RealPage's 
Opposition which makes reference to section 16727. (Opp'n at 5.) "
655,1," These plans include Plumbers and Pipefitters Local 572 Health and Welfare Fund (""Local 572""), IBEW-NECA Local 505 Health

Health and Welfare Fund (""Local Union No. 5"") "
656,2," The statutes are often referred to as ""Illinois Brick-repealers."" In Illinois Brick, the Supreme Court prohibited federal antitrust 
suits by indirect purchasers. Ill. Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 728, 97 S. Ct. 2061, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1977). Following Illinois 
Brick, a number of states passed ""Illinois Brick repealers,"" which established the right of an indirect purchaser to bring an 
antitrust claim under state law. See Wellbutrin XL, 756 F. Supp. 2d at 676 n.1. "
657,3," The plaintiffs have excluded individual purchasers from the ""branded overcharge theory"" to avoid problems with showing 
impact to individuals who continue to purchase branded Wellbutrin XL after generic entry or individuals who are subject to the 
same co-pay for either branded or generic drugs. See Wellbutrin SR, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 105646, at *85-87 (E.D. Pa. Sept. 
30, 2010)."
657,4," The Court notes that it does not disagree with the Wellbutrin SR court's denial of class certification. The plaintiffs in Wellbutrin 
SR failed to demonstrate that class-wide evidence was available to show antitrust impact for a substantial portion of the 
proposed class."
657,5," Both experts are highly qualified. Professor Meredith Rosenthal has a Ph.D. in health policy from Harvard University and she is 
Professor of Health Economics and Policy at the Harvard School of Public Health. Dr. Andrew Joskow has a Ph.D. in economics "
658,," from Yale University. He was the chief  [**13] economist for the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice. He is now Senior 
Vice President at National Economic Research Associates, Inc."
658,6," The parties have not argued that the law of the location of the defendants' conduct (e.g., where the defendants filed patent 
suits) should apply. The parties have also not  [**15] addressed the location of individual consumers because no individual 
consumers are named plaintiffs. In considering the law to apply to TPPs, however, the Court also considers the law to apply to 
individual consumers. For both groups, the Court concludes that the law of the place of purchase applies. "
659,7," When one considers Aetna,  [**17] however, there may not be a true conflict because Aetna's home state of California does 
provide a potential basis for recovery. "
660,8," Case law applying other states' choice of law rules go both ways on this issue. In In re Relafen, the United States District Court 
for the District of Massachusetts concluded that the more significant contact in an indirect purchaser antitrust case is the location 
of the sales to end payor plaintiffs. See In re Relafen Antitrust Litig., 221 F.R.D. 260, 277-78 (D. Mass. 2004) (""[T]he Court 
considers the more significant contact in this context to be the location of the injury — that is, the location of the sales to the end 
payor plaintiffs.""). In K-Dur, Special Master Orlofsky, applying New Jersey's government interest analysis, concluded that individual plaintiffs' 
claims are governed by their state of residence and TPP's claims are governed by their principal places of business. See In re K-
Dur Antitrust Litig., No. 1419, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 113310, 2008 WL 2660783, at *5 (D.N.J. Mar. 19, 2008). See also In re 
Rezulin Prods. Liab. Litig., 392 F. Supp. 2d 597, 611 n.85 (S.D.N.Y. 2005)  [**23] (concluding that the TPP's loss occurred in its 
home state). In In re Lorazepam & Clorazepate, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia concluded that 
Illinois' antitrust law applied for the TPP's reimbursements for purchases made in other states. In re Lorazepam & Clorazepate 
Antitrust Litig., 295 F. Supp. 2d 30, 50 (D.D.C. 2003) (applying Illinois law to an Illinois TPP's payments for purchases 
subscribers made in other states). "
662,9," This substitution applies to New York, Wisconsin, and Nevada. The defendants note that Painters No. 30's Nevada purchase 
was actually transacted in Illinois. The defendants also argue that Local 505 made purchases in Florida through a mail order 
facility. Defs.' Opp'n at 38-41; Pls.' Supp. Reply at 11-13 n.8, 11. Although Local 505's generic mail order purchases appear to 
the Court to be a Florida transaction, Aetna's purchases are also sufficient to state a claim under Florida law. "
664,10," As an initial matter, the Court notes the difference between antitrust impact and the calculation of damages. ""In antitrust and 
securities fraud class actions, '[p]roof of injury (whether or not an injury occurred at all) must be distinguished from calculation of 
damages (which determines the actual value of the injury).'"" Hydrogen Peroxide, 552 F.3d at 311 (quoting Newton v. Merrill 
Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., 259 F.3d 154, 188 (3d Cir. 2001)). "
675,1," The cases SEI relies on do not persuade the Court otherwise. In Leonard Carder, LLP v. Patten, Faith & Sandford, the 
California Court of Appeals found an actual controversy justifying jurisdiction over the claim for state-law declaratory relief. 189 
Cal. App. 4th 92, 116 Cal. Rptr. 3d 652, 653 (Cal. Ct. App. 2010). Two law firms were disputing the allocation of legal fees from 
settlement of a class action. Id. at 654. The money was held in trust and the defendant claimed it was owed forty percent based 
on a prior agreement. Id. The plaintiff disputed the existence of the agreement and sent a check for the significantly lower 
lodestar amount, with a note that the payment was in ""final settlement."" Id. Before cashing the check, the defendant amended 
the memo line to reflect the payment  [*17] was ""credit toward final settlement."" Id. Unlike in this case, each party had taken a 
firm position on the amount due the defendant, which created an ongoing controversy warranting declaratory relief. See id. at 
656-57. In Principal Life Insurance Co. v. Robinson, the Ninth Circuit concluded an actual dispute existed regarding the calculation of 
rent under a lease agreement. 394 F.3d 665, 668 (9th Cir. 2005). The plaintiff had previously attempted to sell its interest in the 
lease. but the dispute regarding the rent calculation undermined the deal. Id. The Ninth Circuit found this past difficulty 
suggested the plaintiff would continue to have difficulty, which warranted declaratory relief. Id. at 672. SEI, however, has not 
alleged any such past difficulties or experiences with the Invention, making only conclusory assertions that its title is uncertain 
and that is has suffered harm to reputation and goodwill. Without more facts, SEI's circumstances are distinguishable from those 
in Leonard Carder and Principal Life. "
676,2," As noted below, Defendants' counsel's unconditional recantation of an ownership interest at oral argument must be given some 
weight in assessing Plaintiff's allegations, which will presumably be clarified in an amended complaint. "
677,3," The SEC has recognized FASB as the only entity whose work-product can be recognized as ""generally accepted"" for the 
purpose of public companies' financial reporting. Commission Statement of Policy Reaffirming the Status of the FASB as a

at 15 U.S.C. § 7219). "
682,1," The complaint alleges that this relevant market also includes the health insurance program that the New York City Transit 
Authority administers. Because the parties did not address this aspect of the alleged market in their briefing before the district 
court, the district court did not consider  [**6] it in resolving the summary judgment motions. See City of New York v. Group 
Health Inc., No. 06 Civ. 13122 (RJS), 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 60196, 2010 WL 2132246, at *3 n.3 (S.D.N.Y. May 11, 2010). The 
parties do not raise this aspect of the alleged market on appeal. "
684,2," The City explains that the Upward Pricing Pressure  [**14] test measures the effect of two opposing forces resulting from a merger. First, the upward pricing pressure induced by the 
merger is measured by the diversion ratio, the sales that would otherwise be lost by a price increase, but that get[] 
recaptured by the diversion of those sales to the larger, merged entity. The second, countervailing downward price 
pressure is measured by efficiencies that would reduce the merged firm's marginal cost. "
687,1," Colonel Patrick Fleming was the original named defendant, but Colonel Robert Williams has succeeded him in the post of Chief 
of the State Police. As the party is a defendant in his official, rather than individual, capacity, the court has made the substitution 
after receiving the new information from the state defendants. "
688,2," John Does II, IX, XI, XII, XV, XX, XXI, XXII, XXV, XXVI, XXVII, XXVIII, XXIX, XXX, XXXI, XXXII, XXXIV, XXXV, XXXVI, 
XXXVIII, XXXIX, XL, XLI, and XLII have been dismissed from this action. John Doe XI was previously knows as John Doe, Jr. 
and originated in York County. John Doe XII was previously known as Richard Rowe I, See Order for Consolidation dated July 
22, 2008. John Doe XV was previously known as Richard Rowe II. There remains another ""Richard Rowe"" case which is 
actually a criminal matter transferred to Kennebec County from York County on Sept. 10, 2010."
688,3," Among the plaintiffs who did not join in this motion  [*6] for summary judgment, one is a criminal defendant who has filed a 
motion to dismiss, one is a Rule 80(c) appeal, and one case, that of John Doe XXXVII, is factually distinguishable from the John 
Does who are the subject of this order. "
689,4," It appears that John Doe V will be eligible to petition for termination of his registration requirements in the near future, under the 
current version of 34-A M.R.S. §11202-A."
689,5," John Doe XLIII was considered to have joined in the Ninth Amended Complaint. John Doe XLIV, represented by Samuel 
Cohen, filed a separate complaint dated on or about October 1, 2010. John Doe XLIII is participating the current motion for 
summary judgment; John Doe XLIV does not appear to have joined in the motion."
689,6," Although John Doe XLIII is not currently on the registry due to  [*9] this court's granting a stay from any registration 
enforcement litigation, should the stay be lifted, he would be ineligible to petition for termination of his registration requirements 
because he does not meet the provisions of the current 34-A M.R.S. § 11202-A(1)(C)."
689,7," The remaining John Does who did not join this motion for summary judgment are: XXXIII, represented by Attorney Francis 
Griffin, whose case was severed by order dated October 14, 2010; and John Doe XLIV, represented by Attorney Samuel Cohen. "
690,8, It is unclear to what extent the plaintiffs continue to advance their parallel argument under 42 U.S.C. §1983. 
696,9," This proposition, and the precedent supporting it, is discussed in more detail in connection with the plaintiffs' MCRA claim 
below."
696,10," Doe V was convicted in 1993, but was not subject to sex offender registration until the 2001 amendments to SORNA of 1999. 
See Doe v. DA, 2007 ME 139, ¶14, 932 A.2d 552, 556 (""In 2001, the Legislature amended SORNA to apply retroactively to sex

697,11," See Doe v. District Attorney, 2007 ME 139, ¶ 14, 932 A.2d 552, 556 (""in 2001, the Legislature amended SORNA to apply

SORNA of 1999. Does III, X, XIV, XIX, XXIII, and XLIII became subject under the 2005 amendments. "
707,12," The state defendants go on to distinguish the cases upon which the plaintiffs rely (Doe v. Nebraska, 2010 WL 3259366 (D. 
Neb. 2010); Doe v. Pros., Marion County, Ind., 566 F.Supp.2d 862 (S.D. Ind. 2008);  [*75] and United States v. Reese, 92 U.S. 
214, 221, 23 L. Ed. 563 (1876)) but the court does not find it necessary to make this distinction in any detail, as the plaintiffs' 
pre-enforcement objection to the statute does not raise any concrete case or controversy and is thus not ripe for judicial 
consideration. See, e.g., Gun Owners' Action League, Inc. v. Swift, 284 F.3d 198 (1st Cir. 2002). "
708,13," The  [*80] plaintiffs' reference to Cutshall v. Sundquist, 193 F.3d 466 (6th Cir. 1999) is unavailing. In that case, the Sixth 
Circuit noted, the ""statute is written in such a manner that the release of registry information can take place at any time law 
enforcement officials have determined that release is necessary to protect the public."" Cutshall, 193 F.3d at 472. Here, law 
enforcement does not have the information at its disposal; the greatest risk to the plaintiffs that the statute would allow would be 
for the bureau to request information from the registrants, at which point they could bring a challenge which would then be ripe. "
710,14," See, e.g., McKune v. Lile, 536 U.S. 24, 33, 122 S. Ct. 2017, 153 L. Ed. 2d 47 (2002) (""When convicted sex offenders reenter 
society, they are much more likely than any other type of offender to be rearrested for a new rape or sexual assault. See Sex 
Offenses 27; U.S. Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, Recidivism of Prisoners Released in 1983, p. 6 (1997)). "
711,15," Although  [*91] SORA of 1991 was in effect at the time, it only required registration for a very small class of crimes, not 
including the crimes to which Doe V pled. He was required to register by the 2001 amendments to SORNA of 1999. See P.L. 
2001, ch. 439, B OOO-7 (effective Sept. 21, 2001) (codified at 34-A M.R.S.A. β 11202 (Supp. 2001))."
711,16," 34-A M.R.S. §11222(4-A)(C) contains the word ""offender""; 34-A M.R.S. §11222(4-B)(C) uses the term ""lifetime registrant."" "
715,17," The plaintiffs' emphasis on the necessity of a hearing for lifetime registrants appears to be an implicit reference to State v. 
Guidry, 105 Haw. 222, 96 P.3d 242 (Haw. 2004), which held ""that the lifetime  [*110] registration component of the Hawai'i sex 
offender registration statute implicates a protected liberty interest under the Hawai'i State Constitution, article I, section V and 
requires that minimum requirements of due process—notice and the opportunity to be heard—be afforded to convicted sex 
offenders."" Id. at 244. The court noted that it had ""provided broader due process protection under the Hawai'i Constitution"" id. at 
251, and that due process required the opportunity to present evidence ""material to a state's statutory scheme and we 
independently hold so under the Hawai'i Constitution."" Id. The Guidry analysis therefore does not guide this court, as the Law 
Court has explicitly held that the Maine Constitution does not afford greater due process protections than the Constitution of the 
United States. See, e.g., State v. Milliken, 2010 ME 1, ¶16, 985 A.2d 1152, 1157-58. "
716,18," Article 1, Section 6-A of the Maine Constitution provides in pertinent part, ""No person shall be deprived of life, liberty or 
property without due process of law . . . ."" "
717,19," The Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution provides in pertinent part, ""No State shall make or enforce any law which 
shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or 
property, without due process of law . . . . "" "
720,20," The court would also note that Dipiazza's holding has subsequently been strongly limited by the Michigan Court of Appeals. 
See State v. TD (In re TD), 292 Mich. App. 678, 823 N.W.2d 101, 2011 Mich. App. LEXIS 954 at *18 (""We note that the majority 
of the binding precedent holds that the SORA does not cause punishment, and the Dipiazza Court's holding to the contrary 
appears confined to the specific facts of that case."")."
720,21," And explicitly did not address the defendant's ex post facto claim, Carmony, 26 Cal. Rptr. 3d at 370 n.6."
720,22," The court also analyzed the proportionality of the registration requirements in its determination that SORNA of 1999, as 
amended, did not constitute punishment, see 11(7), supra. "
724,23," The privacy rights that the Joseph court found to sustain its decision regarding the right to die under the Maine Declaration of 
Rights do not affect this court's analysis that the plaintiffs here have no privacy right in the information that the registry makes 
publicly available through its website. While Joseph's analysis of the right to privacy concerned autonomy over one's own body 
and stemmed from the authority of Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, 484-485, 85 S. Ct. 1678, 14 L. Ed. 2d 510 (1965) and 
cases following it, the plaintiffs here have not offered any precedent to support their alleged right to privacy and counter the 
weight of authority upholding internet posting of a registrant's identifying information in the interest of public safety. "
725,24," Although the analysis was focused on the plaintiffs' ex post facto argument, the court notes that an argument potentially more 
compelling for a discrete and finite class of plaintiffs who pled guilty before a registry was even contemplated, is one of 
fundamental fairness under Maine's Declaration of Rights—a fairness and a right which this court has, above, acknowledged 
 [*148] is for the Law Court alone to determine. "
727,25," This analysis is distinct, since ""the Eleventh Amendment does not apply in state courts."" Will v. Michigan Dep't of State Police, 
491 U.S. 58, 63-64, 109 S. Ct. 2304, 105 L. Ed. 2d 45 (1989) (quoting Maine v. Thiboutot, 448 U.S. 1, 9, n. 7, 100 S. Ct. 2502, 
65 L. Ed. 2d 555 (1980)). ""Although the Eleventh Amendment is not directly applicable to state courts, the doctrine of sovereign 
immunity similarly  [*156] protects the states from actions [in] state courts."" Moody v. Comm'r, Dept. of Human Servs., 661 A.2d 
156, 158 n.3 (Me. 1995). "
730,1," In addition, the Court notes that Plaintiffs' attorney, Michael T. Pines, has been deemed ineligible to practice law. (See Doc. No. 
8.) On July 29, 2011, the Court ordered Mr. Pines to file a substitution of attorney or, in the alternative, for Plaintiff to appear pro

741,3," The FTC asserts that the district court failed to examine a hypothetical market where Indocin IV and NeoProfen were owned 
separately. HN11[
] In determining the relevant market, the district court need not consider a hypothetical market, especially 
here where the FTC offered no evidence about such a hypothetical market. See Yamaha Motor Co., Ltd. v. FTC, 657 F.2d 971, 
977 (8th Cir. 1981) (examining a hypothetical market, absent the challenged conduct, in order to determine whether a violation 
occurred, not to determine the relevant market); United States v. Microsoft, 253 F.3d 34, 78-79, 346 U.S. App. D.C. 330 (D.C.

770,6," In granting the Rule 12(c) motion, the district court declined to consider two expert reports submitted by Memorial months after 
briefing and argument on the motion had concluded, because the reports were outside of the pleadings. Memorial appeals that 
decision, but the argument merits little discussion. HN8[

regulations lacked ""the element of concerted action needed before they can be characterized as a per se violation,"" there could "

delegation might resemble a vertical non-price restraint uniformly analyzed under the rule of reason. See Rice, 458 U.S. at 661-
62; Costco, 522 F.3d at 891 n.11. Even a per se illegal hybrid restraint may be saved from preemption by the ""state action"" immunity doctrine. See Fisher, 475 
U.S. at 265 (citing Parker, 317 U.S. at 341). We do not need to reach the question of stateaction immunity, and thus our opinion

action immunity and unilateral action analyses can be conflated. See 522 F.3d at 887 (citing Snake River Valley Elec. Ass'n v.

understood in context. Not all potentially anticompetitive conduct creates an irreconcilable conflict with federal law, either

renders the phrase ""geographic market"" nonsensical. Perhaps for this reason, our research revealed no case—nor does 
Comcast provide one—in which a geographic market has been set at the individual household level. Cf. Brown Shoe, 370 U.S.

it may be as small as a single metropolitan area.""). "

Opinion ""assumes . . . that the class is properly defined to cover the Philadelphia DMA . . . ."" Id. at 10. The Concurrence-Dissent 
misunderstands an important distinction: as noted supra footnote 4, Plaintiffs have alleged a ""class region"" (to borrow from the 
Concurrence-Dissent's terminology) of a ""Philadelphia cluster,"" which is distinct from the contested relevant geographic market 
of the ""Philadelphia DMA."" Our ""assumption"" concerning  [**32] the ""class region"" is an uncontested piece of Plaintiffs' case: 
Comcast appeals only the precise issue of whether the District Court applied a correct legal standard in determining that the 
substantive antitrust geographic market could be established by evidence common to the class, not whether the ""Philadelphia 
cluster"" is an appropriate ""class region."" See Appellants' Br. at 15 (labeling the issue as: ""The District Court Failed To Apply The 
Correct Legal Standard In Its Ruling On Plaintiffs' Geographic Market Definition""); id. at 20 (summarizing that ""the alleged

798,10," Indeed, recent scholarship uniformly has expressed concern over the trend towards converting certification decisions into mini

969, 970 (2010) (contending that the ""judicial tendency to impose requirements at class certification"" serves no legitimate 
purpose and risks violating the Seventh Amendment); Michael J. Kaufman & John M. Wunderlich, The Unjustified Judicial 
Creation of Class Certification Merits Trials in Securities Fraud Actions, 43 U. Mich. J.L. Reform 323, 323 (2010)  [**47] (stating 
that judicial resolution of merits at the certification stage precludes victims from obtaining redress, infringes on the Seventh 
Amendment, and serves no legitimate policy concerns); Steig D. Olson, ""Chipping Away"": The Misguided Trend Toward 
Resolving Merits Disputes as Part of the Class Certification Calculus, 43 U.S.F. L. Rev. 935, 940 (2009) (intensifying the Rule 23 
analysis is inconsistent with the Rule itself and highly inefficient); J. Douglas Richards & Benjamin D. Brown, Predominance of 
Common Questions ? Common Mistakes in Applying the Class Action Standard, 41 Rutgers L.J. 163, 169 (2009) (contending, 
inter alia, that requiring the district court to determine by a preponderance whether plaintiffs' proposed proof is actually correct or 
incorrect would ""substitute a court's own evaluation of key merits questions for that of the jury""). "
799,11," Dr. McClave used Alternative Delivery Systems penetration rates as a proxy to measure Direct Broadcast Satellite penetration 
 [**51] rates. App. 03410 n.11. Comcast's expert, Dr. Chipty, referred to the screen as the ""DBS screen,"" and as measuring DBS 
penetration rates. App. 03834. The parties and District Court have continued using the DBS terminology. Although the screen 
technically measured Alternative Delivery Systems penetration rates, we will use the parties' terminology and refer to it as the 
""DBS screen"" and as measuring Direct Broadcast Satellite penetration rates. "
800,12," Following the Supreme Court's decision in Wal-Mart, Comcast added that Dr.  [**57] McClave's damages model, like the 
expert model in Wal-Mart, could be ""safely disregard[ed]."" See Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2554. We disagree. The factual and legal 
underpinnings of Wal-Mart—which involved a massive discrimination class action and different sections of Rule 23—are clearly 
distinct from those of this case. Wal-Mart therefore neither guides nor governs the dispute before us. "
801,13," In response to the Concurrence-Dissent's position that Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 113 S. Ct. 
2786, 125 L. Ed. 2d 469 (1993), applies at  [**61] the stage of class certification, see Slip Concurrence-Dissent Op. at 16, we 
make two observations. First, as the Opinion acknowledges, ""in neither the District Court nor before us"" did Comcast raise this 
issue, id. at 17 n.18, and it is therefore not properly before us. Second, although the Supreme Court recently hinted that Daubert 
may apply for evaluating expert testimony at the class certification stage, it need not turn class certification into a mini-trial. Wal-
Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2553-54. We understand the Court's observation to require a district court to evaluate whether an expert is 
presenting a model which could evolve to become admissible evidence, and not requiring a district court to determine if a model 
is perfect at the certification stage. This is consistent with our jurisprudence which requires that at class certification stage, we 
evaluate expert models to determine whether the theory of proof is plausible. Hydrogen Peroxide, 552 F.3d at 324. ""[I]f such 
impact is plausible in theory, it is also susceptible to proof at trial through available evidence common to the class. When the 
latter issue is genuinely disputed, the district court must resolve it after considering  [**62] all relevant evidence."" Id. at 325. 
When plaintiffs present multiple models created by expert witnesses that can show common evidence and those models are 
based on data, a district court does not have to determine which model should be used at the time of class certification. 
Linerboard, 305 F.3d at 155. Here, the District Court likely determined that Dr. McClave's model could be refined between the 
time when class certification was granted and trial so as to comply with Daubert. "
802,14," The Concurrence-Dissent misreads this observation as addressing the on-the-merits validity of the DBS screen. Slip 
Concurring-Dissenting Op. at 25-27. We address Comcast's contention regarding the merits of the DBS  [**65] screen, however, 
infra Part X. This observation indicates simply that the exclusion of the DBS foreclosure theory of liability does not render Dr. 
McClave's damages methodology incapable of calculating damages on a class-wide basis if the class can prove that Comcast 
engaged in anticompetitive behavior."
802,15," The Concurrence-Dissent states that Dr. McClave's damages theory can establish damages only in the five counties where 
RCN attempted to overbuild. This concern misses the central theory of Plaintiffs' case: by deterring the entry of overbuilders 
through clustering, Comcast allegedly  [**66] maintained higher prices across the entire market area. Dr. McClave's damages 
model appropriately reflected a ""but-for"" world by accounting for overbuilding only in the five counties where RCN attempted to 
overbuild, and his resulting calculations showed that—taking the limited actual overbuilding into account—""the Philadelphia DMA 
market prices were elevated above the but-for prices in every county-year combination."" App. 03412. Additionally, the 
Concurrence-Dissent apparently takes up the mantle of an additional Comcast expert and raises multiple arguments against Dr. 
McClave's damages model not addressed by Comcast's experts at the District Court level nor advanced by Comcast on appeal. 
We must limit our review to the issues presented by Appellants and Appellees. We are not permitted to embark on an intellectual 
adventure of our own. "
803,16," Comcast adds that because overbuilding occurs at the franchise level, Dr. McClave's county-to-county metric cannot calculate 
damages if the jury finds that only some (if any) franchises were impacted. First, Dr. McClave indicated that franchises within 
counties often have identical or nearly identical pricing, which assuages Comcast's concern. See App. 03409. Second, Comcast 
is attempting again to redefine the relevant market: inasmuch as Plaintiffs have  [**68] established that the relevant geographic 
market can be the Philadelphia DMA, see supra Part IV.A, their damages model passes muster at this stage of the proceedings."
803,17," The Concurrence-Dissent—unlike  [**70] Comcast's experts, Comcast's lawyers and the District Court—identifies a ""third 
screen."" Slip Concurring-Dissenting Op. at 22. Again, this ""screen"" was not raised by the parties before us and we do not 
address it (we doubt additionally that it is a screen: the two screens were used to select benchmark counties, whereas the 
presence of overbuilders was an identification attached to the already-selected benchmark counties for purposes of performing a 
multiple regression analysis, see App. 03412, 03421 (Corrected McClave Decl.))."
803,18," The Concurrence-Dissent expresses its additional concern over using mathematical averages across the Philadelphia DMA, 
given the potential variation among the franchise areas. Once again, this concern is notably absent from Comcast's briefing 
(except as already addressed above regarding the screens and demographic variables). Nor does the Concurrence-Dissent 
grapple with the abuse-of-discretion standard of review we must apply to the District Court's acceptance of Dr. McClave's 
damages model. We also  [**71] note in passing that the Concurrence-Dissent overstates the degree of dissimilarity among the 
franchise areas. It recognizes that Dr. McClave's model examines actual prices on a county-by-county level, see Slip "
804,," Concurring-Dissenting Op. at 39-40 n.36, but fails to note, as Dr. McClave explained: ""Many franchises within counties often 
have identical or nearly identical pricing. More price variability, and thus from an econometric perspective more information 
about prices and their determinants, is obtained by aggregating prices at the county level."" App. 03409 (Corrected McClave 
Decl.). Not even Comcast's expert contested this reasoning. See App. 03831 (Chipty Decl.); App. 03954 (Chipty Rebuttal 
Report). Finally, to the extent the Concurrence-Dissent questions the appropriateness of using county-level statistics to measure 
damages across the entire Philadelphia DMA, we observe that this question was contested strenuously and repeatedly by the 
experts on both sides at the District Court level. See App. 03410 (Corrected McClave Decl.) (explaining choice of market share 
screen); App. 03833 (Chipty Decl.) (contesting market share screen); App. 04066 (McClave Rebuttal Decl.) (defending market 
 [**72] share screen); App. 03961 (Chipty Rebuttal Report) (disputing screen again); App. 04262 (McClave Reply Decl.) 
(responding to Dr. Chipty's criticisms of screen). After reviewing the reports and hearing careful examination of the experts on 
this point, the District Court found that Dr. McClave's 40% county-level market-share screen was ""supported by the evidence"" 
and that Dr. Chipty's rebuttal was not supported by appropriate data. 264 F.R.D. at 184. Through a clearly erroneous lens, we 
may not reverse a District Court's factual finding if we would weigh the evidence differently; instead, the Court's finding must be 
implausible in light of the record, Anderson, 470 U.S. at 573-574, or completely devoid of minimum evidentiary support 
displaying some hue of credibility, Krasnov, 465 F.2d at 1302. The Concurrence-Dissent breezes past this formidable standard 
of review to reach its own factual finding. "
805,1," I adopt the defined terms, such as ""DMA,"" as used in the Majority opinion."
805,2," Although the Majority opinion decides the question of certification for a single class comprising Comcast customers in the 
Philadelphia DMA, it should be noted that its decision will become a template for resolving similar class certification questions 
pending in cases involving the Chicago and Boston media markets (see Slip Op. at 10 & n.5), and in all likelihood it will be cited 
in other lawsuits against  [**76] cable television service providers (cf. App. at 3652 (Williams Dec.) (explaining that, as part of 
Comcast's swaps and acquisitions, ""Adelphia received Comcast's cable systems and subscribers located in Palm Beach, Florida 
and Los Angeles, California"")). Thus, the problems in the Majority's reasoning will have practical repercussions far beyond this 
case. I therefore write not only because I cannot join the Majority in permitting Plaintiffs to pursue damages on a class-wide 
basis, but also to provide a counterpoint to the Majority's analysis for future consideration."
805,3," Plaintiffs make separate claims for violation of both § 1 and § 2 of the Sherman Act, but each of those claims contains the three 
elements described above, with only the nature of the particular antitrust violation differing. Compare Hydrogen Peroxide, 552 
F.3d at 311 (listing the elements of a § 1 claim as ""(1) a violation of the antitrust laws — here, § 1 of the Sherman Act, (2) 
individual injury resulting from that violation, and (3) measurable damages""),  [**78] with Am. Bearing Co. v. Litton Indus., 729 
F.2d 943, 948 (3d Cir. 1984) (listing the elements of a § 2 claim as ""(1) an antitrust violation, in this case a violation of section 2 
of the Sherman Act; (2) fact of damage or injury; and (3) measurable damages"")."
805,4," Because Comcast had moved to decertify the class entirely before stipulating to all issues other than the predominance 
questions described above, the District Court, which construed the motion to decertify as a motion for reconsideration, granted 
the motion only with respect to those predominance issues and denied it with respect to all other issues. (App. at 437.)"
805,5," While not expressed, the requirement that there must be predominance with respect to both antitrust impact and damages 
appears to be accepted by the parties and the Majority, and I likewise accept that predominance is issue specific. See, e.g., 
Hydrogen Peroxide, 552 F.3d 305 at 311 (""We examine the elements of plaintiffs' claim through the prism of Rule 23,"" to 
determine whether ""proof of the essential elements of the cause of action requires individual treatment."" (internal quotation 
marks omitted)); Newton v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., 259 F.3d 154, 172 (3d Cir. 2001)  [**79] (""To determine 
whether the claims alleged by the putative class meet the requirements for class certification, we must first examine the "
806,," underlying cause of action ... . If proof of the essential elements of the cause of action requires individual treatment, then class 
certification is unsuitable."") Of course, where only some elements of a claim require individual treatment, while others can be 
litigated collectively, it may be appropriate to certify a class for those elements that can be treated collectively, while certifying 
subclasses or requiring individual treatment for those that cannot. See, e.g., Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(4), advisory committee's notes 
(explaining that application of Rule 23(c)(4)'s provision allowing ""that an action may be maintained as a class action as to 
particular issues only"" may be appropriate where, for instance, liability can be proven class wide, but damages cannot); In re 
Nassau Cnty. Strip Search Cases, 461 F.3d 219, 231 (2d Cir. 2006) (remanding to district court with instructions to certify a 
class for liability and to consider whether to also certify for damages or to, alternatively, certify subclasses for damages)."
806,6," Those theories were: (1) that Comcast's high market share resulting from clustering made it profitable for Comcast to deny 
Comcast SportsNet to DBS providers, which lowered DBS penetration rates and allowed Comcast to raise prices; (2) that 
Comcast's clustering reduced ""benchmark competition"" (the ability of customers to compare service and prices among 
competing providers), which allowed Comcast to raise prices; (3) that Comcast's market power increased its bargaining power 
vis-à-vis content providers, which allowed it to raise prices for its services; and (4) that Comcast's clustering deterred competition 
from overbuilders,  [**82] allowing Comcast to raise prices."
806,7," The District Court rejected the theory that clustering reduced DBS penetration because it found that Comcast's denial of 
Comcast SportsNet to DBS providers predated and was unrelated to clustering. It rejected the theory that clustering reduced 
benchmark competition because Plaintiffs had provided no evidence that television consumers actually engaged in benchmark 
competition. It rejected as ""wholly unsupported"" the theory that increased bargaining power vis-à-vis content providers increased 
prices."
806,8," ""Overbuilding,"" as the Majority explained, is where a second cable provider — the ""overbuilder"" — ""builds and offers customers 
a competitive alternative where a telecommunications company already operates."" (Slip Op. at 9.) The existing provider is often 
referred to as the ""incumbent"" provider."
806,9," The geographic scope of the class is actually defined as Comcast's Philadelphia cluster, which, as noted by the Majority, 
excludes the DMA counties of Lehigh and Northampton. As Dr. Chipty explains, those are the two counties in which Comcast 
has no presence (see App. at 3795 & n.12 (Chipty Reply Dec.)), and, therefore, they would be excluded from the class 
regardless  [**83] of its geographic scope. For ease of reference, I refer to the class as encompassing the Philadelphia DMA, 
rather than the Philadelphia Cluster, recognizing that those DMA counties in which there are no Comcast customers are not 
included in the class. "
807,10," For example, the Federal Trade Commission defines ""relevant geographic market"" as the region in which a hypothetical 
monopolist ""would impose at least a [small but significant nontransitory price increase] on some customers in that region"" 
without ""this price increase [being] defeated by substitution away from the relevant product  [**85] or by ... customers in the 
region travelling outside it to purchase the relevant product."" FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION, HORIZONTAL MERGER GUIDELINES 14-15 
(2010). Cf. PHILLIP E. AREEDA & HERBERT HOVENKAMP, FUNDAMENTALS OF ANTITRUST LAW § 5-30 (2010) (""[T]he relevant inquiry"" for 
identifying a geographic market is ""how far [customers] are willing to travel in order to avoid paying the defendant monopoly 
prices."")."
807,11," See In re DVI, Inc. Secs. Litig., 639 F.3d 623, 639 n.22 (3d Cir. 2011) (explaining that, pursuant to Rule 23(c)(1)(B), the class 
definition describes both ""which individuals and entities are included"" and the ""claims, issues or defenses to be treated on a 
class basis""). While Rule 23(c)(1)(B) does not expressly state that the class should include only those for whom the defined 
claims can be proven by common evidence, it is apparent that any class must be defined in a manner consistent with all Rule 23 
requirements, including commonality and predominance. Cf. id. at 639 & n.22 (explaining that the question of whether there was 
predominance when it was alleged that some members of a proposed class ""would be unable to demonstrate loss causation,"" 
was an issue of ""which individuals  [**86] and entities are included in the putative class ... primarily relevant to class definition"")."
807,12," The class region will not necessarily be the same with respect to each element of a class's claims. In fact, even in this case, 
the class region differs with respect to antitrust impact and damages because, for the reasons I identify infra Part II(B), antitrust 
impact can be proven using common evidence across a wider region than damages can be."
807,13," That is not to say that a class region and a relevant geographic market will always be different. An antitrust violation may often 
affect people in only a single geographic market, in which case the relevant geographic market and the class region would be in 
essence the same. "
808,14," The Cable System Transactions are, as described by the Majority, the transactions through which Comcast ""clustered"" its 
franchise areas by ""contract[ing] with competing cable providers to either acquire them or to 'swap' cable systems it owned in 
areas outside the Philadelphia DMA for cable systems within the Philadelphia DMA."" (Slip. Op. at 5.)"
808,15," At least, Plaintiffs have provided no evidence that persons outside of franchise areas that would otherwise have been overbuilt 
can be affected by the elimination of that overbuilding. Dr. Williams opines that, where some parts of a franchise area are 
overbuilt, the overbuilding can affect prices in other parts of that same franchise area that are not overbuilt. (App. at 3704-14 
(Williams Dec.) (explaining that where competing cable companies have ""alternating franchise areas,"" overbuilding by one 
company into portions of the competitor's adjacent franchise area can affect prices in the portion of the overbuilt franchise area 
""that remain monopolized"").) As a theoretical  [**91] matter, it is also plausible that, when one franchise area has been overbuilt, 
the threat of further expansion by that overbuilder could put downward pressure on prices in nearby franchise areas. If such an 
effect is described in the multitude of expert opinions, however, the parties have not identified it. Moreover, even if there is such 
an effect, it would likely be attenuated by distance. It seems doubtful that overbuilding in, for instance, Bucks County, 
Pennsylvania would influence prices in Kent County, Delaware."
808,16," Given that the Class's whole theory is rooted in the premise that Comcast's clustering deterred overbuilding, it is no small 
matter that RCN — the only entity licensed to overbuild anywhere in the Philadelphia DMA — was licensed to overbuild in just 
five of the eighteen counties."
808,17," The Majority responds to my efforts to identify the class region by stating that I have ""misunderst[ood] an important distinction,"" 
namely that Plaintiffs have identified a ""'class region' ... of a 'Philadelphia cluster' which is distinct from the contested relevant 
geographic market of the ""'Philadelphia DMA.'"" (Slip Op. at 26 n.8.) I do acknowledge that distinction. However, that does not 
 [**92] speak to the point because, in spite of that distinction, there remains an equivocal use of the term ""relevant geographic 
market."" That equivocation is evidenced by the Majority's statement — in response to Comcast's suggestion that franchise areas "
809,," might be the appropriate class region for damages — that ""Comcast is attempting to redefine the relevant market: inasmuch as 
Plaintiffs have established that the relevant geographic market can be the Philadelphia DMA ... their damages model passes 
muster."" (Slip. Op. at 51-52 n.16.) The Majority also asserts that there is no question about the class region because Comcast does not dispute the class region 
but disputes only the relevant geographic market. (Slip Op. at 26 n.8) That is not correct. While Comcast does not use the term 
""class region,"" Comcast and its experts plainly argue that the scope of the class is too broad, and they dispute the District 
Court's conclusion that antitrust impact can be proven by common evidence across the Philadelphia DMA. (See, e.g, App. at 
3923 (Teece Reply Dec.) (""[E]ven if RCN would have overbuilt all five counties entirely in the but-for world, this would not be 
sufficient to conclude that the impact  [**93] of the challenged conduct would have affected all Comcast customers in the 
Philadelphia DMA.""); id. at 3922 (""I have seen no evidence that RCN ever intended to build out the entire Philadelphia DMA.""); 
Appellants Br. at 33 (arguing that Dr. Williams's models do not show that clustering ""deterred overbuilding ... in a manner 
affecting all class members""); id. at 24-25 (noting that RCN was licensed in only five counties and arguing that Plaintiffs cannot 
prove that RCN would have entered the Philadelphia DMA). While I do not agree with Comcast's effort to define the class region 
by reference to the relevant geographic market (any more than I agree with the Majority's conflating of those concepts), to say 
that Comcast does not dispute the contours of the class region is not accurate, as the foregoing citations indicate. However, even if Comcast had not disputed the class region, it would still be appropriate for us to address it. The Majority faults 
me for, in its view, addressing problems not raised by Comcast, which the Majority asserts are, therefore, waived. (See, e.g., slip 
op. at 43-44 n.15 (""[T]he Concurrence-Dissent ... raises multiple arguments ... not addressed by Comcast's expert  [**94] ... . We 
must limit our review to the issues presented by Appellants and Appellees.""). But ""there can be no waiver ... of the Judge's duty 
to apply the correct legal standard. ... This is particularly true in the class action context, where ""the district court acts as a 
fiduciary who must serve as a guardian of the rights of absent class members.'"" In re Cmty. Bank of N. Virginia, 622 F.3d 275, 
302 n.20 (3d Cir. 2010) (quoting United States v. Ali, 508 F.3d 136, 144 n.9 (3d Cir. 2007) and In re General Motors Corp. Pick-
Up Truck Fuel Tank Prods Liab. Litig., 55 F.3d 768, 785 (3d Cir. 1995)). Thus, where Comcast has raised the issues of whether 
there is predominance with respect to antitrust impact and damages, we are required to ""apply the correct legal standard,"" — 
which is to determine whether those elements can, in fact, be proven using evidence common to the class — even if that 
requires us ""'to conduct [our] own thorough [R]ule 23[b] inquiry.'"" Id. (quoting Stirman v. Exxon Corp., 280 F.3d 554, 563 n.7 (5th 
Cir. 2002)). By disregarding the problems I have endeavored to identify, the result is an overly broad class definition and, to the 
extent any legitimate claims are proven,  [**95] a likely dilution of recovery. Our fiduciary responsibility to absent class members 
requires that we ensure compliance with the provisions of Rule 23, especially those ""'designed to protect absentees by blocking 
unwarranted or overbroad class definitions.'"" Id. at 291 (quoting Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 620, 117 S. Ct. 
2231, 138 L. Ed. 2d 689 (1997)); cf. Tri-M Group, LLC v. Sharp, 638 F.3d 406, 416 (3d Cir. 2011) (""[T]he waiver principle is only 
a rule of practice and may be relaxed whenever the public interest or justice so warrants.""). Moreover, we must be cognizant of ""the pivotal status of class certification in large-scale litigation,"" which is ""often the defining 
moment in class actions (for it may sound the 'death knell' of the litigation on the part of plaintiffs, or create unwarranted 
pressure to settle nonmeritorious claims on the part of defendants)."" Hydrogen Peroxide, 552 F.3d at 310 (internal quotation 
marks omitted). Pointing out analytical problems central to the certification question is no frolic and detour. It is our obligation."
809,18," Although we have never explicitly held that expert testimony must satisfy Daubert at the class certification stage, it is implicit in 
both Supreme Court precedent and our precedent. In Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, the Supreme Court recently expressed its 
""doubt"" about a district court's conclusion that ""Daubert did not apply to expert testimony at the certification stage of class-action 
proceedings."" 131 S. Ct. 2541, 2553-54, 180 L. Ed. 2d 374 (2011). In Hydrogen Peroxide, we explained that ""opinion testimony 
should not be uncritically accepted as establishing a Rule 23 requirement merely because the court holds the testimony should "
810,," not be  [**97] excluded, under Daubert or for any other reason."" 552 F.3d at 323. Inherent in that statement is the conclusion 
that a court could, at the class certification stage, exclude expert testimony under Daubert. Even without the guidance of Dukes and Hydrogen Peroxide, simple logic indicates that a court may consider the admissibility of 
expert testimony at least when considering predominance. A court should be hard pressed to conclude that the elements of a 
claim are capable of proof through evidence common to a class if the only evidence proffered would not be admissible as proof 
of anything. I recognize, of course, that in neither the District Court nor before us did Comcast describe its challenge to certification as a 
challenge to the admissibility of Dr. McClave's testimony. Nonetheless, while it did not use the language of Daubert, the 
substance of Comcast's challenge was that Dr. McClave's damages testimony was irrelevant and, therefore, did not fit the case. 
(See, e.g., Appellants' Br. at 37 (""Dr. McClave admitted that his damages model takes all of the anticompetitive effects of all of 
the complained-of conduct as a whole, and therefore cannot isolate damages attributable to specific  [**98] conduct or effects.""); 
id. at 42 (""Dr. McClave's DBS penetration screen is substantively invalid because it bears no relation to the competitive 
conditions that would have prevailed in the Philadelphia region.""); id. at 43 (""Dr. McClave's 'market share' screen is likewise 
invalid because it bears no relation to the competitive conditions that would have prevailed in the Philadelphia region.""). The 
Majority protests my invocation of Daubert, but, regardless of whether we frame the issue as a question of fit under Daubert or 
simply ask whether the District Court abused its discretion by relying on irrelevant evidence, we are effectively asking the same 
question. I have chosen the terminology of Daubert because it is particularly apt for describing the difficulty created by the 
change in Plaintiffs' theory of impact and the consequent disconnect between that altered theory and Dr. McClave's expert 
report. The short of it is, Dr. McClave's model no longer fits the case. This observation is not, as the Majority fears, either an 
invitation or a demand for mini-trials in conjunction with class certification motions. I note here as well my disagreement with the Majority's claim that, at the  [**99] class certification stage, we need only ""evaluate 
expert models to determine whether the theory of proof is plausible."" (Slip Op. at 47 n.13.) The Majority supports that position by 
quoting Hydrogen Peroxide's statement that ""'if such impact is plausible in theory, it is also susceptible to proof at trial through 
available evidence common to the class.'"" (Id. (quoting Hydrogen Peroxide, 552 F.3d at 325).) That quotation is better 
understood, however, if one includes the first half of the quoted sentence, which states that ""the question at class certification is 
whether, if such impact is plausible in theory, it is also susceptible to proof at trial through available evidence common to the 
class."" 552 F.3d at 325 (emphasis added). Thus, Hydrogen Peroxide does not suggest that we need only ""evaluate expert 
models to determine whether the theory of proof is plausible,"" as the Majority claims. To the contrary, Hydrogen Peroxide 
instructs that, even where a theory is plausible, ""the question at class certification is whether"" that plausible theory is susceptible 
to common proof. Id. If the only common proof offered is inadmissible expert testimony, then Plaintiffs have not met their burden 
 [**100] of showing that the theory — plausible or not — is capable of common proof."
810,19," I need not, and do not, question whether Dr. McClave is qualified as an expert or whether his methodology is reliable. "
811,20," Whether Dr. McClave's opinion would have fit had the District Court allowed Plaintiffs to pursue all four of their theories of 
antitrust impact is irrelevant at this point."
811,21," As noted by the Majority, ""DBS"" stands for ""direct broadcast satellite"" television service. (Slip Op. at 27.) Dr. McClave actually 
used penetration rates for all alternative delivery systems (""ADS""), rather than just DBS systems. He opined, however, and the 
parties seem to agree, that ""ADS is a proxy for DBS penetration rates."" (App. at 3410.) "
812,22," The  [**107] Majority notes that the overbuilding screen is not mentioned by the parties or the District Court. (Slip Op. at 52 
n.17.) While it is true that the parties do not use the terminology ""overbuilding screen,"" the District Court did indeed describe the 
concept to which I have given that label. See Behrend, 264 F.R.D. at 182 (""Once a county qualified as a benchmark for a 
particular year by satisfying [the DBS penetration and market share screens], it was examined to determine whether or not it had 
been significantly overbuilt.""). Whether one uses the ""screen"" terminology is not what is important. Dr. McClave, in fact, does not 
describe any of the benchmarking criteria as ""screens,"" which is a term that appears to have been only later applied to his 
methods. Regardless of the terminology, the fact remains that Dr. McClave did screen for overbuilding in an attempt to account for 
elevated prices resulting from reduced overbuilding. Thus, that screen cannot be ignored in any ""rigorous analysis,"" Hydrogen 
Peroxide, 552 F.3d at 318, of whether damages resulting from reduced overbuilding can be proven by common evidence."
812,23," The Majority states that, in criticizing Dr. McClave's model for identifying overbuilding damages in only five counties, I have 
""misse[d] the central theory of Plaintiffs' case: by deterring the entry of overbuilders through clustering, Comcast allegedly 
maintained higher prices across the entire market area."" (Slip Op. at 50-51 n.15.) This misperceives my reasoning. I understand 
Plaintiffs' theory but have pointed out that the theory, as altered by the District Court's  [**109] ruling, no longer matches Dr. 
McClave's opinion. More precisely, Plaintiffs' claim is that by reducing overbuilding ""Comcast allegedly maintained higher prices 
across the entire market area,"" (id.) whereas Dr. McClave attempts to show that, by reducing overbuilding, Comcast maintained 
higher prices in only the ""five counties that RCN indicated it planned to enter as an overbuilder,"" (App. at 3412 (McClave Dec.)). 
The Majority notes that this particular problem with Dr. McClave's damages theory was not identified by Comcast, but we ought 
note overlook significant problems with the class certification simply because they are ones we have identified rather than ones 
to which our attention has been directed. "
813,24," According to Dr. McClave, national average DBS penetration during the six year period for which he calculated 
 [**112] damages averaged 24.17%, whereas actual DBS penetration in the Philadelphia DMA averaged 12.77%. (App. at 3411 
(McClave Dec.).)"
813,25," The District Court discussed extensively the evidence that ""DBS competition constrains cable prices."" Behrend, 264 F.R.D. at 
163-65. "
814,26," Again, this is not to say that Comcast's market share, in particular, will never be relevant. As just discussed, it is highly 
relevant for determining antitrust impact. Moreover, it might have been relevant to damages had the District Court not excluded 
three of Plaintiffs' theories of antitrust impact. In fact, the market share screen appears to be another relic of the Plaintiffs' having 
initially presented four theories of impact. One of those theories  [**116] was that Comcast's increased market share increased 
its bargaining power and allowed it to reduce prices, Behrend, 264 F.R.D. at 178-81, and a second was that Comcast's 
increased market share reduced the ability of consumers to engage in benchmark pricing by comparing Comcast's prices to the 
prices of other cable providers in the region, id. at 175-78. Had either of those theories survived the class certification process, it 
might have made sense for Dr. McClave to screen for Comcast's market share, because, under those theories, Comcast's 
market share directly impacted price. But the District Court rejected those theories, allowing Comcast to proceed only on a 
theory that clustering reduced overbuilding. Under that theory, what is relevant is the market share of all incumbent cable 
providers vis-a-vis overbuilders."
814,27," I say he ""effectively calculated damages"" that way because Dr. McClave did not actually make a franchise by franchise 
comparison, which, as discussed infra Part II(B), is itself problematic. He instead calculated Comcast's market share by 
averaging its share throughout the Philadelphia DMA. But, because he included in that average Comcast's zero percent share in 
the franchises in which it had not been present prior to the class period, instead of including the share held by the incumbent 
Comcast replaced, it is fair to say that he effectively  [**118] calculated damages by comparing Comcast's actual share in those 
franchise areas to Comcast's zero percent share prior to the class period. "
815,28," The Majority suggests that any problems with Dr. McClave's screens are ""attacks on the merits of the methodology that have 
no place in the class certification inquiry,"" because, ""[e]ven if we were to overrule as clearly erroneous the District Court's 
findings on all four contested pieces of Dr. McClave's methodology — i.e., modify both of Dr. McClave's screens ... only the final 
amount of estimated  [**119] damages would change."" (Slip Op. at 52.) I disagree. First, the problems I have identified with Dr. 
McClave's screens call into question not only the amount of damages but also whether there are any means of proving damages 
at all in thirteen of the eighteen Philadelphia DMA counties. See supra Part II(A)(1). Second, if Dr. McClave's model does not 
presently constitute a relevant means of calculating class-wide damages, to say that the model might be fixed, for example by 
""modify[ing] both of Dr. McClave's screens,"" (Slip Op. at 52), is no better than saying that Plaintiffs have made ""a threshold 
showing"" of predominance or shown a sufficient ""intention to try the case in a manner that satisfies the predominance 
requirement"" — both of which are insufficient under Hydrogen Peroxide. 552 F.3d at 321 (internal quotation marks omitted). 
Plaintiffs have the burden of establishing predominance and, until they have actually proffered a model that shows how damages 
can be calculated on a class-wide basis, they have not met that burden — particularly when the only evidence they have offered 
should be entirely inadmissible. The Majority's willingness to overlook the debilitating flaws in Dr.  [**120] McClave's model in an 
effort to avoid an ""attack on the merits,"" is precisely the kind talismanic invocation of ""concern for merits-avoidance"" that 
Hydrogen Peroxide forbids. Id. at 317 n.17."
815,29," Or, at least, he screens for overbuilders, DBS providers, and a single incumbent provider — Comcast. I have already 
identified, supra Part II(A)(3), why he should instead screen for incumbent share."
815,30," Dr. Besen, one of Comcast's experts, reports that there are 649 unique franchise  [**122] areas in the Philadelphia DMA. 
(App. at 3782 (Besen Reply Dec.).) "
816,31," While there may be other ""alternative delivery systems"" that have a limited share of the market, Dr. McClave includes those 
providers in his DBS penetration screen, see supra note 21, and they are, therefore, accounted for."
816,32," It  [**125] is possible, of course, that the variation in DBS and overbuilder shares could be such that the combined total of the 
two is the same in different franchise areas, and, therefore, it is not a true mathematical certainty that incumbent share must also 
vary. That that would occur across the 650 franchise areas, however, seems implausible in the extreme."
816,33," Sometimes attributed  [**126] to Mark Twain, the actual source of this quote is unknown."
816,34," The Majority asserts that ""concern over using mathematical averages across the Philadelphia DMA ... is notably absent from 
Comcast's briefing ...."" (Slip Op. at 53-54 n.18.) But it is not absent. In fact, Comcast criticizes Dr. McClave's screens by 
explaining that: "
817,," prior to the Transactions[,] Comcast did not operate in the majority of franchise areas in the DMA. By contrast, in the 
franchise areas where Comcast did operate, it is undisputed that Comcast's market share was significantly higher than 
40%. Thus, the pre-class ""20%"" market share Dr. McClave employed in the creation of his screen is a mirage, arrived at 
solely through the artifice of averaging Comcast's greater-than-40% share of markets where it did operate with its ""0% 
share"" in hundreds of markets where it was not even present. (Appellants Br. at 43.) That criticism precisely mirrors my own. Because of the significant variation in the market makeup from 
franchise area to franchise area, DMA-wide averages are not reliable. See also infra n.35."
817,35," This is not simply a case where there might be some variation in the amount of damages from one class member to another 
that can be ignored in order to gain the benefit of class treatment. Instead, due to the wide variations in the market makeup of 
the franchise areas across the DMA, proving damages will require some factual inquiry into the relative market shares of 
overbuilders, DBS providers,  [**128] and incumbents in individual franchise areas (or perhaps, as subsequently noted in this 
dissent, groups of franchise areas). The Majority, quoting Wright's Federal Practice and Procedure, suggests that those 
differences in damages should not affect the certification process because ""'it uniformly has been held that differences among 
the members as to the amount of damages incurred does not mean that a class action would be inappropriate.'"" (Slip. Op. at 45-
46 (quoting CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT ET AL., FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE § 1781 (3d ed. 2005)).) I agree with the quoted 
statement, but would point also to the following quote from the same treatise: ""Rather, the question of damages can be severed 
from that of liability and tried on an individual basis."" Id. Thus, neither Wright — nor any authority I can find — suggests that 
where there are wide differences in damages from one class member to another, those differences can be ignored. Wright 
suggests instead that those differences can be accounted for by considering liability on a class-wide basis but damages on a 
more individualized basis — consistent with what I propose."
817,36," I recognize that Dr. McClave's model does not treat all franchise  [**129] areas exactly the same, because he uses actual 
prices on a county-by-county level and, as a result, calculates a separate ""but for"" price for each county. (App. at 3424-26 
(McClave Dec.).) But, while he uses actual prices on a county-by-county level, he calculates the ""but for"" prices using the same 
benchmark counties for the entire Philadelphia DMA (again, excepting Lehigh and Northampton, where Comcast has no 
presence). He treats the DMA as though the ""but for"" conditions would have been the same throughout. The Majority states that this criticism ""overstates the degree of dissimilarity among the franchise areas"" because I fail to note 
that ""[m]any franchise areas within counties often have identical or nearly identical pricing."" (Slip Op. at 54 n.18 (quoting App. 
3409 (McClave Dec.).) It may well be that there are similarities allowing for grouping of franchise areas, as I note in suggesting 
the possibility of subclasses. More fundamentally, however, the problem with Dr. McClave's opinion is not that it fails to account 
for variations in actual prices in the Philadelphia DMA, but that it fails to account for variations in the ""but for"" conditions that 
would have existed within the  [**130] Philadelphia DMA. By so doing, the model is unable to distinguish between persons living 
in areas that may have been highly overbuilt and who, thus, would have suffered substantial damages, and persons living in 
areas that may never have been overbuilt and who, thus, would have suffered no damages. "

834,6," The court characterized the question posed by Abbott's motion as ""whether a foreign name-brand drug manufacturer, which 
does not itself market and distribute its product in the United States but does so through an exclusive United States distributor, is 
entitled to avail itself of the protection of the antitrust laws for the purpose of challenging the conduct of a manufacturer of a 
competing brand name drug."""
834,7, All asserted claims but for Ethypharm's allegations that Abbott  [**13] engaged in sham litigation. 
835,8," A patent is, of course, a carefully-crafted exception to the general rule against monopolies. "
836,9," This is an email from Zakrzewski to an Ernest Mario dated July 25, 2006. "
838,10," Abbott also moved for judgment on Ethypharm's former allegation that Abbott lacked a reasonable basis to believe that any 
Stamm patent was valid; Ethypharm expressly abandons this theory in their answering brief. (D.I. 189 at 1, n.2) Judgment, 
therefore, should be entered for Abbott on this particular claim. "
839,11," Ethypharm's 30(b)(6) witness admitted that, if the granulates were tested without the capsule, the dissolution results ""could be 
slightly superior probably"" over testing the intact capsule. (D.I. 182, ex. 19 at 117:7-23)"
839,12," Ethypharm's expert stated it is not ""impossible"" that Antara® dissolves at 10% in 6 minutes. (D.I. 181 at 10) (further citation 
omitted)"
839,13," Williams estimated the dissolution at 6 minutes by ""approximat[ing] by interpolation"" the 5- and 10-minute data in the Antara® 
NDA, and relied on his beliefs that granulates dissolve more quickly than do capsules. (D.I. 189 at 12; D.I. 190, ex. 9 at 104:5-9; 
96:14-97:14) "
840,14," In other words, the 16 other data sets provide a similar dissolution profile to the invention, rendering the contrast between the 
plot for the invention and for Lipanthyl 200 moot. Ethypharm provides a colored chart of these plots in its opposition papers. (D.I. 
189 at 8)"
840,15," Reginault stated that ""the regularity standards for these tests are that the range is 20 percent minimum. So traditionally, it is 
known that results will vary, and this applies to any product."" (D.I. 190, ex. 16 at 96:14-19)"
840,16," With respect to inequitable conduct, this court in Teva ultimately held that the record lacked evidence that Reginault recalled, 
and knowingly withheld, the two inconsistent data sets three years after receiving the data. 580 F. Supp. 2d at 345. "
841,17," Reginault is the only named person at Abbott specifically alleged to have committed inequitable conduct. Ethypharm couches 
many of its arguments in terms of what ""Abbott"" knew or intended; such allegations are too general to withstand scrutiny."
841,18," The Therasense decision issued two days prior to defendant's motion for summary judgment;  [**36] Ethypharm does not 
address it in its answering papers."
841,19," For example, as Abbott points out, there is no indication that Reginault was asked ""when he came to this alleged 
understanding about inherent unreliability and [he] was never asked whether he had that understanding in mind when he 
submitted his 2003 declaration in connection with prosecution of the '881 patent."" (D.I. 197 at 9, n.9) (emphasis in original) "
845,1," This is different from antitrust standing. See Cargill, Inc. v. Monfort of Colo., Inc., 479 U.S. 104, 110-11 nn. 5-6, 107 S. Ct. 484, 
93 L. Ed. 2d 427 (1986) (noting that antitrust injury is necessary, but not always sufficient, to establish standing under Section 4 
and that the standing analysis under Section 16 may differ from that for Section 4); see also Associated Gen. Contractors of 
Cal., Inc. v. Cal. State Counsel of Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 535-46, 103 S. Ct. 897, 74 L. Ed. 2d 723 (1983) (articulating factors 
that courts should consider when determining whether a plaintiff has standing under Section 4); Lucas Auto. Eng'g, Inc. v. 
Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc., 140 F.3d 1228, 1232-37 (9th Cir. 1998)  [*11] (examining whether a plaintiff had standing to assert 
claims for damages and injunctive relief under Sections 4 and 16 of the Clayton Act); Amarel v. Connell, 102 F.3d 1494, 1506-07 
(9th Cir. 1996) (summarizing the factors relevant to determine whether a plaintiff has standing to pursue a damages claim under 
Section 4)."
845,2," Section 4 of the Clayton Act provides treble damages to ""any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason 
of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws."" 15 U.S.C. § 15. Section 16 of the Clayton Act provides that ""[a]ny person, firm, 
corporation, or association shall be entitled to sue for and have injunctive relief . . . against threatened loss or damage by a 
violation of the antitrust laws."" 15 U.S.C. § 26. "
847,3," Plaintiffs acknowledge as much in the Opposition. (See Opp'n at 8 (recognizing that ""Plaintiffs may not have tied their claim of 
civil conspiracy to any particular cause of action . . ."").) "
848,4," As to Plaintiffs' claim that Defendants ""[f]alsely represented that [New Century]  [*22] transferred its interest in the Mortgage to 
Defendants [New Century, Deutsche Bank, and Barclay]"" (FAC ¶ 92(j)), this contention also fails to meet Rule 9(b)'s requirement 
that fraud be pleaded with particularity. In this allegation, Plaintiffs are presumably referring to the assignment from New Century 
to Deutsche Bank, but the complaint is completely devoid of any factual allegations to support Plaintiffs' argument that New 
Century did not have authority to assign the mortgage. Accordingly, this contention cannot withstand a motion to dismiss."
848,5," Although ""[a]ny person"" may bring an action for unfair methods of competition in violation of section 480-2, only consumers, the 
attorney general, or the director of the office of consumer protection may bring an action for unfair or deceptive acts or practices 
in violation of section 480-2. Haw. Rev. Stat. § 480-2(d), (e); see also Davis v. Four Seasons Hotel, Ltd., 122 Haw. 423, 228 
P.3d 303, 307 (Haw. 2010). A ""consumer"" is a ""natural person who, primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, 
purchases, attempts to purchase, or is solicited to purchase goods or services or who commits money, property, or services in a 
personal investment."" Haw. Rev. Stat. § 480-1. "
850,6," The Court notes that Defendant Deutsche Bank requested that Plaintiffs not be allowed to amend their antitrust claims because 
they are allegedly time barred. (Reply at 8.) The Court fails to reach this issue, however, as it is not entirely clear on what date "
851,," Plaintiffs antitrust claims arose. Further, because Deutsche Bank's request is first mentioned in its Reply, both parties 
 [*32] have not had the opportunity to fully brief the issue. "
855,1," Although Defendants do not argue their contract terms are conscionable, the Court finds it prudent in its analysis to review 
whether or not some of the terms in the contract are unconscionable, particularly the arbitration agreement. Under California law, 
an arbitration agreement is unenforceable if it is both procedurally and substantively unconscionable. Davis v. O'Melveny & 
Myers, 485 F.3d 1066, 1072 (9th Cir. 2007). A clause is procedurally unconscionable when it is oppressive-when there is 
inequality in bargaining power between the parties to a contract, resulting in no real opportunity to negotiate the terms of the 
contract and the absence of meaningful choice. Pokorny v. Quixtar, Inc., 601 F.3d 987, 996 (9th Cir. 2010). To determine if a 
clause is substantively unconscionable, ""the focus of the inquiry is whether the term is one-sided and will have an overly harsh 
effect on the disadvantaged party. . . . Thus, mutuality is the 'paramount' consideration when assessing substantive 
 [*12] unconscionability."" Id. at 997 (citation omitted). "

defendants. The Court in that case did not discuss the issue, but appears to have concluded that the amendment did not have 
retroactive effect. See In re Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) Antitrust Litig., 738 F. Supp. 2d 1011, 1025 (N.D. Cal. 2010) (dismissing

869,1," All statutory references are to the Business and Professions Code, unless otherwise indicated."
869,2," El Sineitti does not challenge the court's grant of summary judgment as to her claim under section 17045. Tower did not move 
for summary judgment and is not a party to this appeal. "
870,3," The  [*2] facts and procedural background statement is taken in large part from the court's statement of decision, which 
contains an accurate summary. Additional facts are contained in the discussion, where relevant."
870,4," In her answer to ConocoPhillips's interrogatories, El Sineitti stated that her station ""competes for the sale of gasoline with all 
Union 76-branded stations within a five (5) mile radius."" She identified 14 Union 76 stations supplied by Tower as within this five-
mile radius. She further stated on information and belief that she ""does not contend other non-Union 76 branded retail dealers 
are within [the first amended complaint's] competitive market definition for purposes of the price discrimination alleged in this 
action."""
870,5," The summary judgment motion also alleged El Sineitti could not show that ConocoPhillips gave any of her competitors a 
""secret payment or allowance""—a required element for a section 17045 cause of action. El Sineitti does not dispute the court's 
summary judgment grant as to this claim. "
871,6," ""[I]f  [*8] the trial court fails to rule expressly on specific evidentiary objections, it is presumed that the objections have been 
overruled, the trial court considered the evidence in ruling on the merits of the summary judgment motion, and the objections are 
preserved on appeal."" (Reid v. Google, Inc., supra, 50 Cal.4th at p. 534.)"
871,7," The parties agree that because California price discrimination law closely parallels the Robinson-Patman Act, and is based 
upon the same policy considerations, case law under the act is considered persuasive authority by California courts. (Cf. ABC 
Internat. Traders, Inc. v. Matsushita Electric Corp. (1997) 14 Cal.4th 1247, 1261 [The prohibition on unearned discounts, codified 
as section 17045, of the Unfair Practice Act (§ 17000 et seq.), was designed to prohibit similar types of business conduct as the 
federal Robinson-Patman Act]; G.H.I.I. v. MTS, Inc. (1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 256, 271 [Unfair Practice Act closely parallels, and is 
based upon same policies as, Robinson-Patman Act]; Petroleum Sales, Inc. v. Valero Refining Co. (N.D. Cal. 2006) 2006 WL 
3708062, p. *21 [applying Robinson-Patman Act analysis and the requirement that plaintiff show it was in actual competition with 
a favored purchaser at the time of the price differential to section 21200 claim of price discrimination].) "
872,8," ""Thus, in summary, to establish illegal secondary-line price discrimination between purchasers, a plaintiff must prove the 
following elements: (1) sales made in interstate commerce; (2) the commodities sold to purchaser were of the same grade and 
quality as those sold to other purchasers; (3) that the seller discriminated in price between purchasers; and (4) that the 
discrimination had a prohibited effect on competition. A price discrimination within the meaning of §13(a) is an actual price 
difference. The 'prohibited effect on competition' element of the prima facie case requires that the discrimination have caused an 
actual injury to the disfavored purchaser.  [*13] Causation is established by examining whether the favored and disfavored 
buyers were in actual competition with each other and proof of injury. Actual competition requires that the plaintiff prove a 
relevant product and geographic market to be defined. Proof of injury to competition is established prima facie by proof of a 
'substantial' price discrimination between competing purchasers over time."" (Water Craft, supra, 361 F.Supp.2d at p. 538, italics 
added.) "
873,9," ""In determining that the favored and disfavored purchasers are 'competitors,' the most obvious set of criteria that come to mind 
are those for defining relevant geographic and product markets. Under those criteria two sellers are in the same market if they 
(1) compete for sales to the same customers and (2) one seller's competition is sufficient to restrain the other's ability to set price 
above the competitive level. But the Robinson-Patman inquiry typically differs from the general relevant market inquiry in that the 
second part of the question is unnecessary. As a general matter, it need be shown only that the two sellers compete for the 
same customers."" (XIV Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law (2d ed. 2004) ¶ 2333b, p. 97, fns. omitted.) "
875,10," ""If it appears from the affidavits submitted in opposition to a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication or both 
that facts essential to justify opposition may exist but cannot, for reasons stated, then be presented, the court shall deny the 
motion, or order a continuance to permit affidavits to be obtained or discovery to be had or may make any other order as may be 
just. The application to continue the motion to obtain necessary discovery may also be made by ex parte motion at any time on 
or before the date the opposition response to the motion is due."" (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (h).)"
875,11," ""Upon proof being made, at any hearing on a complaint under this section, that there has been such discrimination in price, 
 [*26] the burden of rebutting the prima facie case thus made by showing justification shall be upon the person charged with a 
violation of this section."" (§ 21200.) "
876,12," The four customer declarants are: William Mayta, Mark Gin, Joe Koman and Kathryn McGarey."
876,13," Various individualized circumstances described in the customers' declarations also impact where they purchase gasoline, 
including the station's proximity to the declarant's residence, proximity to a family member's residence, proximity to work, 
whether he or she is traveling to shop at Costco, or whether traveling on business. "
877,14," Mayta would travel over five miles from his home to obtain a price savings of $.05 to .10 per gallon.) He states: ""If a station 
where I am buying gasoline raises its price above another station with which I am familiar and is reasonably near to my house, I 
will stop and buy gasoline from the lowest priced station when I need gasoline."" He would ""probably"" buy from a Union 76 station 
such as the 999 Ocean Avenue station or  [*32] the 101 South Mayfair Street station if its price were $.01 to .02 per gallon less 
than El Sineitti's station. He also travels on business and would purchase gasoline at a station over five miles from El Sineitti's 
station if its price were $.05 to .10 per gallon less than El Sineitti's. Finally, he has a second home in Forestville, California, 
where the price differential is often significant and he tries to buy gasoline there. Gin states he has bought gasoline from ""ARCO stations, including some located at distances over 5 miles from [Gin's business]."" Koman has purchased gasoline from a South San Francisco Costco station, located seven and one-half miles from his 
residence. McGarey has purchased gasoline from an Olympian station in San Francisco, located about three miles from her residence. "
878,15," We believe the court could have excluded Martig's opinion on the basis that he was not qualified to render an opinion on 
customer behavior or the relevant geographic market as he had no degree or training in economics, had not studied consumer 
purchasing behavior or patterns in El Sineitti's proposed market or in any market, and had never testified  [*37] previously in an 
antitrust matter. (Cf, Morgan, Strand, Wheeler & Biggs v. Radiology, Ltd. (9th Cir. 1991) 924 F.2d 1484, 1490 [non-economic 
witness was unqualified ""to opine on a highly technical economic question"" of defining a relevant geographic market; Western 
Parcel Exp. v. United Parcel Service (N.D.Cal. 1998) 65 F.Supp.2d 1052, 1058-1060 (Western Parcel), affd. 190 F.3d 974 
[summary judgment for defendant where plaintiff's experts had no background in antitrust economics or antitrust law and had 
not offered opinions on market definitions in previous litigation].) ConocoPhillips asserted Martig was unqualified in writing in its 
reply to plaintiff's opposition and again orally at the summary judgment hearing, when counsel argued that Martig was ""not 
qualified to give an opinion"" regarding whether El Sineitti was in competition with other Union 76 stations in the antitrust 
economic sense. ConocoPhillips has not ""waived"" such objection on appeal. (Reid v. Google, Inc., supra, 50 Cal.4th 512, 526-
527, 531-532 [evidentiary objection in summary judgment proceedings was made in writing before the hearing or raised orally at 
the hearing, the trial court's failure to rule on the objection  [*38] does not waive the objection for purposes of appellate review].) "
879,16," See also United States v. Pabst Brewing Co.(1966) 384 U.S. 546, 549 [government need not prove ""by an army of expert 
witnesses what constitutes a relevant 'economic' or 'geographic' market""]."
879,17," Those cases observing that expert testimony is not always required do not support El Sineitti's claim that ""common sense"" and 
anecdotal evidence of the type she has submitted suffice to provide evidence from which a jury could determine the relevant 
market. El Sineitti asserts that in Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Technical Services, Inc. (1992) 504 U.S. 451, 467, the Supreme Court 
found without any expert testimony, that there existed a triable issue as to whether there was a relevant product market for parts 
and services for Kodak equipment. (Id. at pp. 481-482 [""The relevant market for antitrust purposes is determined  [*41] by the 
choices available to Kodak equipment owners""].) The court did not discuss whether expert testimony was necessary and nothing 
in the case suggests that expert testimony was not necessary to define the relevant market. In Victus, supra, 26 F.Supp.2d 772, 787, the court stated: ""Economic experts may not be required, but [the plaintiff] has not 
provided affidavits of any witnesses who can address such questions, even if their opinions are based solely on their experience 
in the industry. No reasonable jury could find that a relevant market, as described by [the plaintiff], exists; therefore, summary 
judgment must be entered against [the plaintiff]."" (Fn. omitted.) In Brooke Group Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., supra, 509 U.S. 209, 242, the court stated: ""Expert testimony is 
useful as a guide to interpreting market facts, but not as a substitute for them."" However, expert testimony was presented by the 
parties and the court made this statement in the context of rejecting the testimony of the expert. The court explained, ""When an 
expert opinion is not supported by sufficient facts to validate it in the eyes of the law, . . . it cannot support a jury's verdict."" (Ibid.) In TYR Sport, supra, 709 F.Supp.2d 802,  [*42] the district court overruled the defendant's objection to lay testimony of the 
plaintiff's executive vice president who had worked in the performance swimwear industry for 34 years and whose testimony 
regarding barriers to competition in the international market supported the plaintiff's geographical market as the United States, 
rather than the international market. The court distinguished Morgan, Strand, Wheeler & Biggs v. Radiology, Ltd., supra, 924 "
880,," F.2d at page 1490, in which the Ninth Circuit concluded lay witness testimony on the technical subject of the relevant geographic 
market was impermissible. In contrast, the executive vice president in TYR Sport ""testifie[d] only as to factual characteristics of 
the geographic market, which [was] within his competency as an industry veteran. He [did] not give a conclusory opinion on 
market definition, unlike the witnesses in Morgan."" (TYR Sport, at p. 816, fn. 17.) In Coast to Coast Entertainment, Inc., supra, 2005 U.S.Dist.LEXIS 26849, the court concluded that even were it to consider the 
information provided in plaintiff's non-expert declarations, the plaintiff had failed to demonstrate the relevant product market. (Id. 
at p. *56.) The  [*43] court also recognized that ""a plaintiff cannot prove the relevant market through generalizations about any 
particular industry, but instead must demonstrate the economic and commercial realities of the particular market studied. 
Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Technical Servs., 504 U.S. 451, 467, 112 S. Ct. 2072, 119 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1992)."" (Coast to Coast 
Entertainment, at pp. *51-52.) In Anti-Monopoly, Inc. v. Hasbro, Inc., supra, 958 F.Supp. 895, 904, the plaintiff did submit the declaration and cross-elasticity 
reports of an expert economist ""to satisfy its burden relating to market definition."" Yet, the court concluded plaintiff had failed to 
satisfy that burden. (Id. at p. 903.)"
880,18," ""See, e.g., Am. Key Corp. v. Cole Nat'l Corp., 762 F.2d 1569, 1579 (11th Cir. 1985) (holding that '[c]onstruction of a relevant 
economic market or a showing of monopoly power in that market cannot . . . be based upon lay opinion testimony'); Va. 
Vermiculite, Ltd. v. W.R. Grace & Co., [supra,] 108 F. Supp. 2d 549, 576[, fn.] 16 . . . (holding expert testimony practically 
necessary for market definition); Drs. Steuer & Latham, P.A. v. Nat'l Med. Enters., Inc., 672 F. Supp. 1489, 1512[, fn.] 25 (D.S.C.

Inc. v. Hasbro, Inc., [supra,] 958 F. Supp. 895 . . . , affd., 130 F.3d 1101 (2d Cir. 1997), stated that 'experts are not always 
essential to defining the relevant market,' id. at 904, it cited for this proposition United States v. Pabst Brewing Co., [supra,] 384 
U.S. 546, 549 . . . , which dates from an era in which market definition was not conducted on economic grounds."" (Lopatka and 
Page,  [*45] supra, 90 Cornell L.Rev. at p. 660, fn. 265.) "
881,19," On appeal, El Sineitti points to a broad range of pages, rather than to specific page cites, to support her claims. This makes 
our task more difficult. Nevertheless, we have reviewed all the exhibits cited by plaintiff and find the court correctly determined 
that she failed to articulate the link between these documents and deposition testimony and her claimed geographic market. "
883,20," The trial court recognized that having found El Sineitti had failed to raise a triable issue of material fact as to the definition of 
her relevant competitive market, it ""need go no further."" Nevertheless, it proceeded to address the parties' remaining arguments. 
As to the section 21200 price discrimination cause of action, the court concluded that El Sineitti also ""failed to present a triable 
issue of fact as to whether she received substantial  [*59] price differentials over a significant period of time that resulted in 
competitive harm,"" and that she ""failed to show a triable issue of fact as to whether she suffered any injury caused by 
ConocoPhillips."" "
886,1," Specifically, Defendants sought dismissal of Plaintiff's Second Claim for Breach of Contract, Fifth Claim for Breach of Fiduciary 
Duty, Seventh and Eight Claims for Intentional and Negligent Misrepresentation, Ninth Claim for Conversion, and Tenth Claim 
for violation of Business & Professions Code Section 17200. Defendants further moved to strike Plaintiff's prayer for punitive 
damages on the grounds that Plaintiff failed to plead a claim that would entitle him to punitive damages. "
887,2, Plaintiff's FAC does not include a 7th claim for relief. 
892,3," ""When a plaintiff who claims to have suffered injury from a direct competitor's 'unfair' act or practice invokes section 17200, the 
word ""unfair"" in that section means conduct that threatens an incipient violation of an antitrust law, or violates the policy or spirit 
of one of those laws because its effects are comparable to or the same as a violation of the law, or otherwise significantly "

898,1," Any harm that accrues after the tolling of the statute of limitations periods but that is associated with an overt act that occurred 
prior to the limitations period is not remediable. However, ""each separate cause of action that so accrues [during the statute of 
limitations period] entitles a plaintiff to recover not only those damages which he has suffered at the date of accrual, but also 
those which he will suffer in the future from the particular invasion, including what he has suffered  [*10] during and will 
predictably suffer after trial."" Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 401 U.S. 321, 338-39, 91 S. Ct. 795, 28 L. Ed. 2d

899,2," Based  [*14] in part on the briefing of this issue in the reply, Plaintiff moved for leave to file a sur-reply. Defendants objected 
and filed a sur-response. Although the Court finds neither to be necessary, it has reviewed all of the filings before the Court."
899,3," The Court notes the allegation in the First Amended Complaint that ""even if the combination among the SD Group members 
could have been justified 10 years ago when the SD Card was first produced, the continued and ongoing agreements among 
three major competitors to maintain a dominant position in the SD Card and related markets cannot be justified today, given the 
absence of current efficiencies that could outweigh the combination's ongoing anticompetitive effects."" (FAC ¶ 57.) Should 
Plaintiff opt to amend it complaint for a third time, the Court exhorts Plaintiff to pinpoint a specific time at which Defendants' 
conduct allegedly became an unjustified violation of antitrust principles. "
903,1," Following the plaintiffs' case in chief, the Court granted defendants' Rule 50 motion as to both liability and damages as to all 
ITGBL claims pertaining to all channels other than those related to the 14 channels for which the carrier Covan International set 
the prime rate for IS01 (referred to as the ""Covan Channels"") and the 12 channels for which the carrier Cartwright International 
 [*4] set the prime rate for IS02 (referred to as the ""Cartwright Channels""). The Court also granted defendants' motion as to the 
plaintiffs' common law claims. The Court reserved with respect to whether the plaintiffs presented sufficient evidence for a jury to 
determine the number of false claims that defendants caused to be filed as to both the Covan Channels and the Cartwright 
Channels. The Court denied defendants' Rule 50 motion as to the Direct Procurement Method (""DPM"") claim. Following the 
close of all of the evidence, the Court again denied defendants' Rule 50 motion as to the DPM claims but again reserved as to 
the sufficiency of the evidence for a jury to determine the number of false claims that defendants caused to be filed, expressing 
substantial doubt as to the sufficiency of the evidence in that regard, including the sufficiency of the evidence with respect to 
certain summary charts and related exhibits, and the exclusion of those exhibits under Fed. R. Civ. P. 37 and otherwise. On 
August 4, 2011, the jury returned a verdict in the defendants' favor as to the Covan Channels and in the plaintiffs' favor as to the 
Cartwright Channels and the DPM claim. The jury further found  [*5] that defendants caused to be filed 4,351 false claims as to 
the Cartwright Channels and the parties stipulated that in the event of liability as to the DPM claim, the defendants filed 9,136 
invoices under the DPM contract. Re. Ex. 296. The Court ordered that any post-trial motions, including those pertaining to the 
issues on which the Court reserved, be filed on or before August 29, 2011."
903,2," The Shipping Act of 1984 was amended effective October 6, 2006. The Court applies the version of the statute in effect during 
defendants' conduct, 46 U.S.C. app. §§ 1701-1719 (2000). "
904,3, The Statement of Facts is based on the evidence presented during plaintiffs' case in chief at trial. 
905,4," The Sonthofen Agreement stated in its entirety: ""We, the undersigned companies agree that as of 4/1/2001 we will be using 
'landed rates' for the U.S. Military business."" Gov. Ex. 14."
905,5," Prior to the Sonthofen Agreement, Gosselin had used a ""landed rate"" system with the freight forwarders since the late 1990s, 
which the government does not challenge. The Sonthofen Agreement for the first time infused into the landed rate system the 
alleged collusion of the German local agents to act in concert. "
906,6," In the years preceding the Sonthofen Agreement, several freight forwarders that had set the prime rates had filed for 
bankruptcy, with the result that many of the German local agents, including Gosselin and the other signatories to the Sonthofen 
Agreement, had not been paid millions of dollars for their services. "
907,7," The amended version of the Shipping Act, 46 U.S.C. § 40307(a)(5), states that the antitrust laws do  [*21] not apply to ""an 
agreement or activity relating to the foreign inland segment of through transportation that is part of transportation provided in a 
United States import or export trade."" "
908,8," Pursuant to the act, ""'ocean common carrier' means a vessel-operating common carrier"" and ""'common carrier' means a person 
holding itself out to the general public to provide transportation  [*24] by water of passengers or cargo between the United States 
and a foreign country for compensation ..."" 46 U.S.C. app. § 1702(6), (16). "
916,1, The Court GRANTS Electrograph's unopposed request for judicial notice. 
918,2," Although the Court concludes that it lacks personal jurisdiction over Mitsui Taiwan, it reaches the question of subject matter 
jurisdiction to ensure that Electrograph's request to amend its complaint would not be futile. See Broughton, 622 F.2d at 460 
(holding that leave to amend should be granted unless amendment would be futile and ""the deficiencies of the complaint could 
not be cured by amendment.""). "
930,1," Flagship introduced evidence that as of June 2008, the resulting Cinemark theater  [***4] circuit operated theaters with 3,483 
screens at 270 locations and was the third largest theater circuit in the United States."
930,2, All subsequent statutory references are to the Business and Professions Code unless otherwise indicated. 
931,3," Flagship has also alleged [***9]  a claim under the UCL. The UCL does not proscribe specific practices. Rather, it defines 
“unfair competition” to include “any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or practice.” (§ 17200.)"
931,4," Vertical restraints are restraints embodied in agreements between parties at different levels of the distribution chain (for 
example, between a wholesaler and a retailer). "
932,5," Griffith acknowledged that “[l]arge-scale buying is not, of course, unlawful per se” and “may yield price or other lawful 
advantages to the buyer.” (Griffith, supra, 334 U.S. at p. 108.) But the opinion went on to state that large-scale buying “may not, 
however, be used to monopolize or to attempt to monopolize interstate trade or commerce. Nor … may it be used to stifle "
933,," competition by denying competitors less favorably situated access to the market.” (Ibid.) Given the court's per se condemnation 
of circuit dealing on both the monopoly leveraging theory and the elimination of theater-by-theater bidding theory, we conclude 
that the court's recognition that not all large-scale buying is unlawful per se was not meant to imply that circuit dealing in 
particular is subject to rule of reason analysis."
933,6," Our search of all federal and state court case law found only a handful of cases even potentially touching on the issue. 
Redwood Theatres was the only state court case, and the remaining post-1940's  [***16] cases contained no useful discussion 
of the issue."
933,7," HN9[
] In general, an appellate court reviews only the trial court's ultimate decision, not the reasoning on which it was based, 
and we may affirm the decision on any valid theory. (J.B. Aguerre, Inc. v. American Guarantee & Liability Ins. Co. (1997) 59 
Cal.App.4th 6, 15–16 [68 Cal. Rptr. 2d 837].) In an appeal from a summary judgment, however, we are statutorily prohibited from 
affirming the judgment on a ground not relied on by the trial court unless we first afford the parties an opportunity for 
supplemental briefing on the issue. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (m)(2).) Our analysis accordingly focuses at the outset on 
the trial court's grounds for its decision. "
934,8," We note that some lower courts have not used the term “antitrust injury” consistently, sometimes employing it 
“comprehensively to include injury-in-fact caused by the defendant” or the “impact on competition” of the defendant’s alleged 
conduct. (2A Areeda et al., Antitrust Law, supra, ¶ 337a, p. 83; see generally id., pp. 83–84 & fns. 3, 4 [collecting cases].) We, 
however, “use that term in the precisely focused sense of Brunswick.” (Id., pp. 83–84.) "
935,9," To prove an antitrust claim subject to the rule of reason, however, a plaintiff must prove that the anticompetitive effects of the 
defendant's conduct outweigh its procompetitive effects, which might require the plaintiff to prove that the market has actually 
become less competitive. That is irrelevant to our point here, which is that the antitrust injury requirement, which applies to cases 
under the  [***23] rule of reason and the per se rule alike, does not require the plaintiff to show that the market has become less 
competitive. "
937,10," The trial court's ruling on defendants' summary judgment motion does not state that defendants carried their initial burden on 
those points. Rather, after rejecting the circuit dealing claim on the ground that Flagship failed to show antitrust injury, the court 
stated that Flagship had presented “no evidence whatsoever to raise a triable issue of fact supportive of a true circuit dealing 
issue in this case.” But the court did not first assess whether defendants had  [***32] carried their initial burden on that issue. "
942,1," Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint is styled as a class action and asserts certain ""class allegations"" in addition to the allegations 
specific to the named Plaintiffs. [See, e.g., dkt. 84 at 18-20.] To date, however, Plaintiffs have not filed a motion to certify a class. 
Because the Court ultimately finds that Plaintiffs' claims must be dismissed and no motion to certify a class is pending, ""the suit 
must be dismissed because no one besides the plaintiff has a legally protected interest in the litigation."" Wiesmueller v. 
Kosobucki, 513 F.3d 784, 786 (7th Cir. 2008); see also Sheridan v. Marathon Petroleum Co., LLC, 530 F.3d 590, 592, 596 (7th 
Cir. 2008) (affirming trial court's dismissal of ""entire suit"" for failure to state a claim before motion to certify class was filed); 
Banks v. Nat'l Collegiate Athletic Ass'n, 977 F.2d 1081, 1085-86, 1094 (7th Cir. 1992) (dismissing entire suit because named 
plaintiff failed to allege antitrust claim and no class  [*5] certification ruling to appeal). Because no motion to certify is pending, 
the Court will focus on the allegations specific to the named Plaintiffs. "
943,2," Different NCAA bylaws govern Division I, II, and III sports. [Dkt. 93 at 25.] There is no dispute that Plaintiffs received 
scholarships to play sports at Division I schools. Despite this undisputed fact, as the NCAA points out, the Amended Complaint 
references Division II and Division III financial aid rules that Plaintiffs were not bound by and could not have been injured by. 
[Dkt. 93 at 25.] Plaintiffs do not respond to this argument; therefore, the Court construes Plaintiffs' silence as an acceptance of 
its merit and will not construe the Amended Complaint as stating any claim regarding Division II and III financial rules. "
944,3," The Supreme Court recently reaffirmed the application of the Rule of Reason to restraints on competition that are essential if 
the product is to be available at all. American Needle, Inc. v. National Football League, 130 S. Ct. 2201, 2216, 176 L. Ed. 2d 947 
(2010)  [*10] (citing Board of Regents, 468 U.S. at 101). Although the Court need not conduct the applicable analysis at this 
stage in the proceedings, for purposes of context, the Rule of Reason tests whether a restraint merely regulates and perhaps 
thereby promotes competition or whether it may instead suppress or even destroy competition. American Needle, 130 S. Ct. at 
2217 n. 10 (citation omitted). To analyze that question the Court must typically consider ""the facts peculiar to the business to 
which the restraint is applied; its condition before and after the restraint is imposed; the nature of the restraint and its effect, 
actual or probable."" Id. "
945,4," Plaintiffs urge the Court to reject Banks and apply Chicago Professional Sports Limited Partnership v. National Basketball 
Association, 961 F.2d 667 (7th Cir. 1992). [Dkt. 116 at 29.] The Court disagrees with Plaintiffs that CPSLP is binding authority in 
this context. Banks, which is more recent, directly addressed an NCAA bylaw in the amateur sports context, while CPSLP 
addressed television broadcast rights in the professional sports context. Therefore, the Court finds the Seventh Circuit's 
interpretation of Board of Regents and its general discussion of NCAA bylaws to be controlling. "
946,5," The parties, particularly Plaintiffs, cite numerous out-of-Circuit cases that they believe support their arguments. Because the 
Court finds applicable Seventh Circuit precedent to be controlling, it will not address those cases."
946,6," At oral argument, the NCAA argued that the one-year scholarship rule makes athletic-based scholarships equivalent to 
academic scholarships, which typically operate on a year-to-year basis. [Dkt. 116 at 5.] Additionally, the NCAA contended that 
the one-year scholarship rule takes ""some of the potential abuse"" out of the recruiting process, which promotes amateurism. [Id.] 
The NCAA's proffered procompetitive  [*18] justification for the cap on the number of available scholarships is ""competitive 
balance and competitive equity."" [Id. at 7.] Without such a cap, the NCAA believes that some schools would offer extra 
scholarships to stockpile players so that those players would be unable to play for a competitor. [Id. (referencing Gary Shaw, 
Meat on the Hoof: The Hidden World of Texas Football (1972)).] The NCAA also made a cogent argument that the bylaws at 
issue are not anti-competitive because output remains constant. For example, if a student-athlete's scholarship is not renewed, 
the school will offer that spot to another individual, thereby maintaining output in the market. As detailed below, however, the 
Court will not address the NCAA's proffered justifications because they are beyond the scope of evaluating Plaintiffs' Amended 
Complaint."
946,7," Likewise, the Court will not address the NCAA's argument that its rules are entitled to a presumption of reasonableness. [Dkt. 
93 at 19-22.] "
947,8," Although Plaintiffs challenge two NCAA bylaws—the one-year scholarship limit and the cap on the number of athletic-based 
discounts a school can offer—they do not differentiate between those bylaws when addressing the alleged labor and bachelor's 
degree markets. The Court presumes that Plaintiffs know what is best for their case and structured their opposition to the 
NCAA's motion accordingly. See Greenlaw v. United States, 554 U.S. 237, 243-44, 128 S. Ct. 2559, 171 L. Ed. 2d 399 (2008) 
(""[W]e rely on the parties to frame the issues for decision and assign to courts the role of neutral arbiter of matters the parties 
 [*22] present . . . . Our adversary system is designed around the premise that the parties know what is best for them, and are 
responsible for advancing the facts and arguments entitling them to relief."") Therefore, the Court will address each of the 
markets the Plaintiffs allege without distinguishing between the challenged bylaws. "
949,9," Because the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have failed to allege a relevant product market, it need not address the NCAA's 
argument that Plaintiffs have failed to allege injury to competition. [Dkt. 93 at 18-19.] Additionally, the Court rejects the NCAA's 
standing argument that the Amended Complaint does not allege that the Plaintiffs were injured by the NCAA Division I bylaws at 
issue. [Dkt. 93 at 22-25.] Plaintiffs allege that they initially received an athletic scholarship to attend their respective universities 
but that those scholarships were not renewed after they could no longer play sports, causing them to pay tuition through other 
means. [Dkt. 84 at 14-15 ¶¶ 43-50.] They further allege  [*30] that had they been free to negotiate a four-year scholarship, they 
would have avoided those costs. Those allegations are sufficient to establish antitrust standing at this stage in the proceedings."
949,10," As detailed in footnote one, supra, the Court must dismiss the entire action because no one besides the named Plaintiffs have 
a legally protected interest in the litigation at this time. Wiesmueller, 513 F.3d at 786; Sheridan, 530 F.3d at 592, 596; Banks, 
977 F.2d at 1085-86. "
958,1," Rates of market foreclosure by Payco exclusive accounts rose from 28.2 percent in 2004 to 30.8 percent in 2005, but declined 
to 29.4 percent in 2006 and 19.5 percent in 2007; the agreements were mostly for one to two years. Sterling argued that 
foreclosure rates were higher than these figures in certain sub-regions of Puerto Rico. The district court rejected this attempt at 
""gerrymandering of markets . . . to artificially show high levels of foreclosure"" given that Sterling had identified the relevant 
market as the entirety of Puerto Rico in its complaint. Sterling Merch., Inc. v. Nestle, S.A.., 724 F. Supp. 2d 245, 265 (D.P.R. 
2010). "
959,2," Sterling also claims that Nestlé PR's post-merger exclusivity agreements were ""unremunerative,"" but Sterling does not develop 
the argument or cite to evidence to support this allusion to predatory pricing, and did not adequately raise this argument to the 
district court."
959,3," Sterling also attributes its financial performance to the fact that the pendency of both this litigation and an investigation of 
Nestlé by the Department of Justice has caused Nestlé PR and its subsidiaries to ""restrain themselves from unleashing the full 
brunt of their power to completely destroy competition."" "
960,," At oral argument, Sterling raised for the first time the argument that the real danger of Nestlé PR's conduct is the injury that 
might come to pass in the future, whether or not it has suffered injury now, such as to entitle it to injunctive relief. No such 
argument was raised in the appellate briefs or in the district court. We decline to address this new argument that Sterling need 
not show antitrust injury to obtain injunctive relief. This argument has been doubly waived. See Cortés-Rivera v. Dep't of Corr. & 
Rehab, 626 F.3d 21, 27 (1st Cir. 2010). "
961,4," At oral argument, Sterling pointed for the first time to evidence that purportedly shows consumer ice cream prices in Puerto 
Rico increased during the relevant period. Sterling had not cited these documents in its appellate brief. In any event, they do not 
show consumer prices increased. Sterling points to deposition testimony of its president, which indicates that Sterling had, at 
one time in 2006, increased prices by 15 percent to some of its retailers. But Sterling's president explicitly stated that the 
increase was limited, and that he ""held pricing back at key retailers through 'roll backs.'"" In any case, there is no evidence that 
the limited  [**24] number of price increases to retailers were ever passed on to consumers. Sterling also points to a July 24, 
2003 email from a Payco officer that opaquely refers to aligning Nestlé PR prices with Payco prices following the 2003 merger, 
but this evidence does not show such a price increase actually occurred, and again speaks only to prices to retailers, not 
consumers. The only evidence Sterling cites that actually relates to consumer prices is a chart detailing pricing of various ice 
cream brands at Econo supermarkets from June 2003 until August 2006. But that chart shows consumer prices remained 
relatively constant during the three year period. "
962,5," Despite its increased sales, profits, and market share, Sterling argues it suffered damages because it would have earned far 
more were it not for Nestlé PR's exclusive agreements. It points to its 42 percent and 50 percent market share in retail stores 
that have no exclusive agreements as plausible benchmarks for what its market-wide performance would be in the absence of 
exclusive agreements. But this damages model assumes that the proper ""but-for"" market is one without any exclusive 
agreements. That assumption is erroneous, as these agreements are often efficient and pro-competitive, have been in use in 
Puerto Rico since before the merger, and, as discussed below, are not illegal in this case. In a market devoid of any exclusivity 
agreements, Sterling may perform better, but Sterling is not entitled to such a market. "
963,6," Alternative sources exist here. The parent  [**33] company of Nestlé PR is Nestlé, S.A. The major competitor of Nestlé, S.A. on 
the manufacturing level is Unilever, which has used Sterling as a distributor in Puerto Rico during some of the time period at 
issue. We note that the Puerto Rico Office of Monopolistic Affairs (PROMA) approved the 2003 Nestlé PR/Payco merger upon Nestlé 
PR's agreement to seek PROMA's approval before transferring the distribution rights to Edy's ice cream (but not any other 
Dreyer's brand) from Sterling to another competitor unless Sterling had, in the interim, acquired distribution rights to either 
Breyer's or Blue Bunny ice cream. "
964,7," Given our conclusions,  [**37] we need not consider the statements of Nestlé PR's officers that Sterling argues evidences 
Nestlé PR's specific intent to monopolize. "
967,1," The Government brought suit under Section 15 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 25, to ""prevent and restrain [defendants] from 
violating Section 7 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 18."" Compl. ¶ 11. Plaintiff states brought suit under Section 16 of the Clayton 
Act, 15 U.S.C. § 26. Id. "
969,2," The Government's Supplemental Statement also offers a helpful and satisfactory explanation of the logistics and benefits of 
""baseball-style"" arbitration. See Supp. Stmt. at 3 n.4."
969,3," The Government contends, however, that arbitration under the proposed Final Judgment offers a valuable tradeoff: expedited 
and final resolution. See, e.g., Supp. Stmt. at 2, 5-6."
969,4," Under the arbitration proposed in the Final Judgment, an OVD must first seek permission from the United States to arbitrate 
under this ""alternative"" yet ""complementary"" mechanism. Supp. Stmt. at 4-5 (citing Proposed Final  [**9] Judgment § VII.C). If 
the Government allows arbitration to move forward, any arbitration award is non-appealable. Id. at 4. If the Government denies 
an OVD's request to arbitrate, the OVD may still initiate arbitration under the FCC Order, which is available as a matter of right 
and is appealable. Id. at 3-4. "
988,1," Abecassis is the founder, President and CEO of Nissim and inventor of its patents. For the sake of simplicity and unless 
otherwise indicated, this Order refers to both Nissim and Abecassis as ""Nissim."""
988,2," For further background see the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit opinions 
and this Court's rulings in this and related cases. See ClearPlay Inc. v. Max Abecassis & Nissim Corp., 602 F.3d 1364 (Fed. Cir. 
2010); Nissim Corp. v. ClearPlay, Inc., 374 Fed. Appx. 987 (Fed. Cir. 2010);  [*3] ClearPlay Inc. v. Nissim Corp., No. 10-13469, 
433 Fed. Appx. 782, 2011 U.S. App. LEXIS 14072 (11th Cir. July 7, 2011); and this Court's prior orders from case numbers 04-
CV-21140 and 08-CV-80535. "
989,3, CustomPlay is a Nissim subsidiary.
989,4," Section 1.4 of the License Agreement requires, inter alia, that ClearPlay's filters be ""in substantial compliance with the 
CustomPlay Specifications, it being recognized by the parties that application of the CustomPlay OC Specifications requires 
flexibility of artistic judgment within the overall goal of maintaining consistency."" "
990,5," At the time of this and the Court's other observations regarding the sufficiency of ClearPlay's bad faith allegations, the Federal 
Circuit had not yet issued its ruling. The Federal Circuit opinion, Nissim Corp. v. Clearplay, Inc., 374 Fed. Appx. 987 (Fed. Cir. 
2010), only strengthens this Court's prior pronouncements regarding Nissim's statements' lack of ""objective baselessness."""
990,6, The grounds for ClearPlay's  [*10] injunctive relief are not relevant to this order. 
991,7," ClearPlay disputes the veracity and implications of the statements made in the below-summarized Nissim communications but 
it does not dispute the communications' content."
991,8," Nissim's Statement of Undisputed Facts (D.E. # 332-1) at times miscites the docket entries for Nissim's communications. The 
Court uses the current docket entry numbers for the communications, which are all attached to ClearPlay's Third Amended 
Complaint (D.E. # 185). "
992,9, These are the patents covered by Nissim's DVD Specifications license.
992,10," As indicated subsequently in this opinion, ClearPlay takes the position that both a) its products designed around Nissim's 
patents with regard to the DVD Specifications and b) Nissim's patents are not necessary for implementation of the DVD 
Specifications. "
994,11," The Court also notes that while other Circuits have applied Noerr-Pennington immunity to bar not only anti-trust claims but 
also state tort claims, the Eleventh Circuit has done so only in a very specific context. See McGuire Oil Co. v. Mapco, Inc., 958 
F.2d 1552, 1560 (11th Cir. 1992) (holding that First Amendment underpinnings of the Noerr Pennington doctrine bar not only 
anti-trust claims but also a state unfair trade practices claim, which in that case was identical to the anti-trust claim); Atico Int'l 
USA, Inc. v. Luv N' Care, Ltd., Case No. 09-60397-CIV, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 73540, at *11 (S.D. Fla. Aug. 19, 2009) (citing 
""many circuit courts"" that  [*24] have used the Noerr-Pennington doctrine to bar state law claims and finding that Noerr-
Pennington immunity bars state law claims for tortious interference and FDUTPA violation); but see Slip-n-Slide Records, Inc. v. 
TVT Records, LLC, No. 05-21113-CIV, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9014, at * 21-22 (S.D. Fla. Feb. 8, 2007) (declining to extent 
Noerr-Pennington immunity to bar state tort claims wholly unrelated to an anti-trust claim). Therefore, judicial restraint also 
motivates the Court's decision to apply only the Federal Circuit's patent preemption doctrine, not Noerr Pennington immunity, to 
ClearPlay's state law claims, which are unrelated to anti-trust law."
994,12," Nissim also argues that patent preemption should apply to ClearPlay's breach of contract claim. The Court acknowledges that 
certain theories of breach (breach of Sections 4.2 and 4.7, specifically) allege that Nissim violated the Settlement and License "
995,," Agreement by making its communications of infringement. Because the Court presently reserves ruling on summary judgment 
as to ClearPlay's breach of contract claim to allow for further development of the record as to the facts supporting the contractual 
issues, the Court also declines to rule at present on the issue of patent preemption of certain theories of breach of contract."
995,13," ClearPlay also argues that Nissim's communications made statements  [*29] ""disparaging ClearPlay's products"" and 
""mischaracterizing"" the parties' litigation before this Court. The Court finds that the statements to which ClearPlay is referring, 
such as statements regarding the operation of ClearPlay's filters and the course of the 2004 case, are part and parcel of 
Nissim's allegations that ClearPlay's products do not comply with the Settlement and License Agreement and, hence, are 
infringing. "
996,14," The Court notes that the majority of these communications were made in Nissim's letters—that is, its letter to ClearPlay (the 
January 14, 2008 letter copying Best Buy) and its letters to ClearPlay retailers and manufacturers (June 11, 2007 letter to 
Target, October 19, 2007 letter to Target, February 22, 2008 letter to Best Buy, March 19, 2008 letter to Best Buy, and August 
11, 2008 letter to Samsung). However, Nissim also communicated its patent rights and allegations of license non-compliance 
and infringement in press releases, which are also protected under patent law. Even Nissim's broad statement in its June 11, 
2007 press release ""providing formal notice to all retailers and other third parties"" that the 007 Player was not compliant with the 
Settlement and License Agreement and warning that sales of this Player constitute infringement is protected  [*32] so long as it 
was not made in bad faith. See Globetrotter Software, Inc. v. Elan Computer Group, 362 F. 3d 1367, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2004) 
(stating federal patent law preempts state law that punishes merely ""publicizing a patent in the marketplace[,] unless the plaintiff 
can show that the patentholder acted in bad faith."")(internal citation omitted). "
997,15," ClearPlay does not dispute this fact; although, as discussed below, ClearPlay disputes that Nissim's patents are necessary for 
implementation of the DVD Specifications. "
999,16," In Breckenridge Pharmaceutical, Inc. v. Metabolite Laboratories, Inc., 444 F.3d 1356, 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2006), the Federal 
Circuit reversed summary judgment on state tortious interference and unfair competition claims based on patentee's letters 
publicizing its patents because the ""question of whether any statements in the letters were 'objectively baseless' is genuinely 
disputed."" The court in Breckenridge provided no indication of the facts that the patentee asserted to support no objective 
baselenessness, thus providing little guidance here, and also  [*46] did not cite the clear and convincing standard followed by 
the Federal Circuit in 800 Adept, Inc. v. Murex Securities Ltd., 539 F.3d 1354, 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2008) and reiterated in Dominant 
Semiconductors Sdn. Bhd. v. OSRAM GmbH, 524 F.3d 1254, 1260 (Fed. Cir. 2008). "
1011,1," The criminal investigation led to Horizon Lines, LLC pleading guilty to one count of price fixing in violation of the Sherman Act 
and five guilty pleas from former employees of the Horizon and Sea Star Defendants. See United States v. Horizon Lines, LLC, 
No. 3:11-CR-0071, Second Amended Judgment (D.P.R.,  [**16] Apr. 28, 2011); United States v. Chisholm, No. 08-cr-00353,

1011,2," ""Prices"" in this context include both the negotiated costs of shipping and the various surcharges, such as fuel surcharges, 
imposed by cabotage providers."
1011,3," Horizon accounts for approximately 35% of the Puerto Rico cabotage market; Crowley and Sea Star account for approximately 
30% and 21% of the market, respectively. Trailer Bridge, a Defendant that was ultimately dismissed from the instant matter 
(Docket No. 722), accounts for approximately 14% of the Puerto Rico cabotage market. "
1012,4," Alexander Chisholm was the Assistant Vice President of Yield Management for Sea Star. On October 20, 2008, Chisholm, 
along with four other individuals, pled guilt to government charges that he destroyed evidence concealing the alleged 
conspiracy. United States v. Chisholm, No. 08-cr-00353, Plea Agreement (M.D. Fla. Oct. 20, 2008)."
1012,5," Paragraph 16 of the Notice states that ""payment of attorneys' fees [will] not [] exceed one third of the Horizon, Crowley and Sea 
Star Settlement Funds plus the value of the non-cash portion of the Settlements."" Paragraph 8 of the Notice defines the terms 
""Horizon Settlement Fund,"" ""Crowley Settlement Fund,"" and ""Sea Star Settlement Fund"" as the settlement amounts in cash to 
be paid by each of the settling defendants (Horizon, Crowley and Sea Star). Therefore, the notice is clear that attorneys' fees 
would be computed as a percentage of the total value of the settlement (including the value of the non-cash portion) and will be 
paid from the cash portion of the Settlements."
1012,6," Specifically, the Court had expressed concern ""that the notices may have inadvertently misled Class Members to believe that 
they could select both the base rate freeze and the cash option."" The Court also was concerned that the INEOS Objectors 
needed additional ""time and information to ascertain whether the settlement was adequate as to them."" Both of these concerns, "
1013,," however, were allayed through scrutiny of the Notices sent to Putative Class Members and the case law cited by the INEOS 
Objectors. Additionally, in the Final Fairness Hearing,  [**22] the Court expressed doubts as to the explanation provided to the 
Court regarding the methodology utilized by Plaintiffs' expert; however, upon a subsequent review of the materials provided by 
the expert, the Court verified that all necessary information was included."

1013,8, The accompanying memorandum of law (Docket No. 839) is now deemed NOTED.
1013,9," Lead Counsel originally valued the total settlement at $157,250,000. The base rate freeze option was initially valued at $105 
million by calculating all the Class Members that could potentially elect the base rate freeze option. Thus, Lead Counsel 
assumed that no Class Member would elect the cash settlement. By adding the cash settlement, $52,250,000, with the Lead 
Counsel's calculation of the base rate freeze option, $105,000,000, Lead Counsel valued the total settlement at $157,250,000. 
Lead Counsel's request for attorneys' fees in the amount of $25 million is approximately 16% of $157,250,000. The Court cautioned Lead Counsel against this type of double counting. The Class Members can elect either to receive a portion 
of the cash settlement or the base rate freeze option thereby locking in lower shipping prices for two years. Class Members 
cannot elect both options. However, by assuming that all members would elect the base rate freeze option Lead Counsel 
significantly inflated the value of the base rate freeze option. Moreover, the Court found it imprudent to rely upon a hypothetical and theoretical ""maximized potential"" value that the 
settlement fund may reach  [**24] at a future date, when Lead Counsel is requesting to withdraw a portion of the settlement fund 
for their compensation on this certain date. A court must be conservative in assessing the total value of the settlement fund and 
base those assessments on actual, tangible benefits that are able to be calculate in the present. See Petruzzi's, Inc. v. Darling 
Delaware Co., 983 F. Supp. 595, 608 (D. Pa. 1997) (finding that ""awarding fees on the basis of a hypothetical 'common fund' in 
the percentage sought by class counsel would be a perverse result."")."
1013,10," ""Objectors"" includes Pan American Grain Co., Inc., Pan American Grain Manufacturing, Inc. and Pan American Grain 
Properties, Inc. (""Pan American"") as the Court granted leave for Pan American to join the Objectors on January 18, 2011 
(Docket No. 892)."
1013,11," As Putative Class Members were advised that attorneys' fees were to be taken from the Settlements in the documents sent to 
them, the Court finds this argument unmeritorious for the same reasons it found other Objectors' arguments regarding the "
1014,," sufficiency of the Notice lacking in merit. The Court has already found that Putative Class Members were informed and were 
granted ample information to make educated business decisions regarding whether to opt in or out of the Settlements and 
regarding their options if they indeed opted in."
1014,12," The Class Action Fairness Act also mandates that defendants  [**27] provide notice of a proposed class action settlement to 
specific federal and state officials. 28 U.S.C. §1715. Defendants, through the settlement administrator, provided the Attorney 
General of the United States, state officials in which each class member resides and the Attorney General for the 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico with notice of the proposed Horizon Settlement on July 16th and 17th of 2009. (Docket No. 997). 
Defendants notified these same officials of the proposed Crowley and Sea Star Settlements on October 14, 2010. (Docket No. 
997). Prior to granting final approval of the proposed settlements, the Court notes that it has waited the statutorily required 90 days 
from the date of notification. See 28 U.S.C. §1715(d). "
1015,13," For purposes of evaluating the size of the fund, Lead Counsel returns to its previous argument that the total value of the 
settlement is $157,250,000. (Footnote 8). Lead Counsel arrives at this figure by adding the cash portion of the Settlements, 
$52,250,000, with their estimate that the base rate freeze options could have a maximized potential value of $105 million over a 
two year period. A handful of Class Members objected in a footnote to Plaintiffs' expert's calculation of the actual value of the 
Settlements, but the Class Members provided no contrary expert's opinion. "
1016,," The Court finds that the actual total value of the Settlements is $65,850,000. The actual total value of the Settlements is 
comprised of two components: the cash portion  [**33] of the settlements, $52,250,000, and the value of the base-rate freeze 
option actually selected by Class Members, $13,600,000. HN5[
] When Lead Counsel is requesting to withdraw a portion of 
the settlement fund today for their compensation, the Court finds it imprudent to rely upon a hypothetical and theoretical 
""maximized potential"" value of what the settlement fund may reach on a future date. The Court should be conservative in 
assessing the total value of the settlement fund and base those assessments on actual, tangible benefits that are able to be 
calculated in the present. See Petruzzi's, Inc. v. Darling Delaware Co. Inc., 983 F. Supp. 595, 608 (M.D. Pa.. 1996) (finding 
that ""awarding fees on the basis of a hypothetical 'common fund' in the percentage sought by class counsel would be a perverse 
result."")."
1016,14," On September 15, 2010, Lead Counsel commenced mailing the Long-Form Notice and Claim Form to 61,854 potential class 
members. These members were identified from the transactional records provided by the Horizon, Crowley and Sea Star 
Defendants. "
1018,15, The District Court additionally granted plaintiffs' counsel $1.75 million in attorneys' fees to be paid directly by defendant. 
1019,16," As mentioned previously, five former employees of the Horizon and Sea Star Defendants entered guilty pleas accepting 
criminal antitrust liability. See United States v. Horizon Lines, LLC, No. 3:11-CR-0071, Second Amended Judgment (D.P.R., Apr. 
28, 2011); United States v. Chisholm, No. 08-cr-00353, Plea Agreement (M.D. Fla., Oct. 20, 2008); United States v. Serra, No.

1020,17," By dividing the total lodestar by the 30,000 hours billed, the Court calculates that Lead Counsel's average hourly rate is 
approximately $465."
1020,18," Lead Counsel has not provided the Court with detailed billing records supporting its claim of working more than 30,000 hours 
(Docket No. 836). Nevertheless, to save the Court from engaging in mathematical precision or bean-counting when calculating 
the lodestar cross-check, the Court may rely on summaries of hours submitted by counsel and not review actual billing records. 
In re Rite Aid, 396 F.3d at 306-307. Based upon the Court's common sense, experience, and familiarity with this case, the Court 
finds that expending over 30,000 billable hours is reasonable in the instant matter. The Court also notes that no party has 
challenged counsels' hours. "
1022,19," Specifically, Pan American states that their counsel expended 139.5 hours opposing Lead Counsel's request (Docket No. 
992); V. Suarez assert that its counsel expended 272.5 hours (Docket No. 993-1); Carribean Produce's counsel alleges that it 
expended 247.5 hours (Docket No. 993-2); and Central Produce claims that its counsel expended 206 hours (Docket No. 993-3). 
Thus, in total, Objectors billed 865.5 hours for opposing Lead Counsel's fee request. The Objectors' informative motions are hereby NOTED (Docket Nos. 992 and 993)."
1022,20," More precisely, Objectors would receive $1,162.91 per hour. The Court additionally concludes that the Objectors were 
overzealous in spending 865.5 hours for developing their arguments. As the Objectors made identical arguments common to all 
parties and sought an identical remedy, the Objectors should have pooled their resources to craft a single, cogent filing as 
opposed to duplicating their efforts. "
1023,21," The Objectors have reached an agreement amongst themselves to divide any fee award based upon the respective volume of 
cabotage purchased by the Objectors from Defendants during the relevant period  [**61] (Docket Nos. 989 and 990). 
Accordingly, the parties have agreed to that V. Suárez, Inc. will receive 57.41% of the award; Caribbean Produce Exchange, Inc. 
will receive 25.49%; Central Produce El Jibarito, Inc. will receive 11.37%; and Pan American will receive 5.36%. The Court will 
uphold this agreement and orders that the Objectors' award be distributed in accordance with these percentages. Accordingly, 
the Court GRANTS the Objector's request (Docket Nos. 989 and 990) and now finds as MOOT the Objector's prior request 
(Docket No. 988)."
1023,22," The Court notes that Congress has expressed some skepticism about incentive awards. Congress made the following finding 
in the Class Action Fairness Act: ""Class members often receive little or no benefit from class actions, and are sometimes 
harmed, such as where . . . (B) unjustified awards are made to certain plaintiffs at the expense of other class members."" Pub. L. 
No. 109-2, § 2(a)(3), 119 Stat. 4. Additionally, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA) prohibits granting 
incentive awards to class representatives in securities class actions. See 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(a)(2)(A)(vi). "
1024,23," In accordance with the Class Notice, dated August 25, 2010 (Docket No. 874-1), the Crowley Settlement will not reimburse 
Lead Counsel for more than $250,000 in expenses."
1024,24," The Court held a Final Fairness Hearing on November 18, 2010 (Docket No. 876). "
1025,25," On March 22, 2011, Horizon pled guilty to one count of violating the Sherman Antitrust Act and the Court imposed a criminal 
fine of $45,000,000 to be paid in gradually increasing installments over four years. United States v. Horizon Lines, LLC, No. 
3:11-CR-0071, Judgment (D.P.R., Mar. 22, 2011)(Docket No. 29). The following month, however, the Court reduced Horizon's 
fine, at the request of the United States, by two-thirds to $15,000,000. The $15,000,000 fine is similarly payable in gradual 
installments over four years, in an effort ensure sufficient cash flow to continue operations and to ensure that Horizon would be 
able to compensate the Class. United States v. Horizon Lines, LLC, No. 3:11-CR-0071, Second Amended Judgment (D.P.R.,

1.583%. "

necessary. "
1037,2," Specifically, Defendants  [**16] concede the non-conclusory nature of certain Complaint paragraphs even though these

1040,3," This Court's prior Order, when read as a whole, makes clear this Court only looked to Watson Carpet to supply the standard by 
which inferences are to be drawn from circumstantial allegations of conduct taken pursuant to a conspiratorial agreement 
established by direct allegations. In other words, when a complaint sufficiently alleges an express conspiratorial agreement, a 
plaintiff need not worry about the varying inferences that may be drawn from the complaint's subsequent allegations so long as 
one such inference plausibly suggests consistency with the unlawful agreement. Watson Carpet only assists when assessing 
circumstantial allegations of conspiratorial  [**32] conduct, not the presence or absence of the antecedent agreement. "
1044,4," The court's decision in Hinds County II to toll the limitations period after earlier determining that plaintiffs failed to sufficiently 
plead fraudulent concealment, see Hinds County I, 620 F. Supp. 2d at 521-22, demonstrates this case is consistent with the 
""hypothetical diligence"" standard embraced in Campbell. Unlike here, where Plaintiffs plausibly allege no reasonable methods 
for discovering the alleged conspiracy existed before 2010, the plaintiffs in Hinds County II employed reasonable certification 
requirements, albeit unsuccessfully, in an effort to prevent bid collusion. "

1058,6," We note that, even if plaintiff were correct that the policy  [*16] at issue constituted a vertical RPM agreement, we see little 
merit in plaintiff's theory that N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law § 369-a, which renders such agreements unenforceable but not illegal, is a 
reason to treat them as per se violations of the Donnelly Act. To the contrary, HN11[
] while the Donnelly Act makes unreasonable price restraints unlawful, section 369-a has the distinct aim of preventing parties from seeking the assistance of 
the courts to enforce these restraints. As there is no suggestion that KWC has ever sought to conscript the courts into enforcing 
the IAP, § 369-a is not relevant here. "
1059,7," Even assuming plaintiff had adequately alleged an agreement, there have been no factual allegations regarding the relevant 
market, the actual effects of the IAP on this market, or the market power of the parties, all of which would be necessary to 
support a rule of reason analysis. Thus, even if KWC had structured the IAP as an agreement with distributors, something it 
explicitly  [*20] did not do, the factual allegations in the complaint would still be insufficient to state a Donnelly Act violation under 
the rule of reason standard. "
1066,1," The Twombly Court explicitly disavowed the oft-quoted  [*6] generally accepted rule in Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46,

1968-69 quoting Conley, 355 U.S. at 45-46. "
1067,2," Prior to amendment, the Louisiana Supreme Court held that a parent company and its subsidiary were capable of conspiring in 
restraint of trade under § 122 of the Louisiana antitrust law, contrary to the United States Supreme Court's interpretation and in 
spite of virtually identical state and federal statutes. See Free v. Abbott Laboratories, Inc., 176 F.3d 298, 299 (5th Cir. 1999) 
citing Louisiana Power and Light Co. v. United Gas Pipe Line Co., 493 So.2d 1149, 1158-1160 (La.1986). However, the 2003 
amendment legislatively overruled that holding. "
1068,3," As set forth above, PCI has failed to state a claim under the Sherman Act, the sole federal claim asserted herein. Therefore, 
this action is properly before this court solely on the basis of diversity jurisdiction, the only jurisdictional basis asserted by the 
plaintiff. Accordingly, dismissal for lack of personal jurisdiction is appropriate. However, even if this were not the case, ACTIV alternatively seeks dismissal for failure to state a claim under Fed. R. Civ. P. 
12(b)(6). As set forth above, Count II is subject to dismissal for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. 
Moreover, as argued by ACTIV, plaintiff's remaining state law claims are subject to dismissal for failure to state claims for relief. 
ACTIV was not a party to the agreements which are the subject of the PCI's breach of contract claim asserted in Count I. With 
respect to Count III, plaintiff has failed to set forth an unfair trade practice claim against ACTIV based on the alleged 
 [*12] breach of agreements to which it was not a signatory or the antitrust claims asserted in Count II. Moreover, with respect to 
Count IV, plaintiff fails to state any acts of misrepresentation by ACTIV upon which PCI may have relied to its detriment. "
1076,1," Metris is now called Nikon Metrology N.V. The Court will continue to refer to the plaintiffs collectively as ""Metris."" "
1079,2," Therasense analogizes to the unclean hands doctrine in explicating the affirmative egregious misconduct exception. 2011 U.S. 
App. LEXIS 10590, [WL] at *12 (exception ""incorporates elements"" of the unclean hands doctrine""). But a critical difference 
remains between unclean hands and inequitable conduct, even when inequitable conduct is based on affirmative egregious 
misconduct: The unclean hands doctrine allows courts to dismiss suits brought by bad faith plaintiffs, whereas the inequitable 
conduct doctrine results in the unenforceability of the entire patent. 2011 U.S. App. LEXIS 10590, [WL] at *4. This remedy, which 
the Federal Circuit has described as the ""atomic bomb"" of patent law, 2011 U.S. App. LEXIS 10590, [WL] at *8, is appropriate 
only in cases where the patent itself is called into doubt. "

also filed reply briefs (hereinafter, ""Reply"")."
1107,2, Other pending motions in this litigation will be addressed separately in other memoranda.
1107,3," The direct purchaser plaintiffs are comprised of two subclasses—one subclass consists of entities that directly purchased shell 
eggs from Defendants and the other subclass consists of entities that directly purchased egg products from Defendants. The 
SAC defines ""shell eggs"" as ""both 'table eggs' (generally purchased by retail entities for re-sale [sic] to the consuming public) 
and 'breaking eggs' (generally purchased by food service entities for further processing)."" SAC ¶ 2. ""Egg products"" are defined 
as ""breaking eggs that have been removed from their shells and processed into dried, frozen or liquid forms."" Id. Although 
Defendants filed a separate joint motion seeking to dismiss Plaintiffs' claim pertaining to ""egg products"" (Doc. Nos. 235 and 
237), because that motion is still pending, for present purposes the SAC's definition for ""eggs"" will apply. The dispute over the 
definition is not germane to the resolution of the motions addressed in this Memorandum."
1107,4," The transcripts  [**5] of the oral argument on the motions to dismiss the SAC are contained in the record at Docket Nos. 490 
and 424 (hereinafter, respectively, ""Day 1 Tr."" and ""Day 2 Tr."")."
1107,5," The SAC is certainly not vulnerable to any criticism for being too lean or brief. Indeed, in some respects a thorough 
consideration of these motions demanded something of a hunt through a pleading that could be described as repetitious or 
organizationally puzzling. However, the Court is not unaware of the good faith concern among the pleadings' drafters that brevity 
may expose the proponent to heightened risks of dismissal. In any case, the generous inclusion of verbiage added to the Court's 
concern for careful examination. "
1108,6," A propos of the immediate preceeding footnote, subsequent paragraphs in the 520-paragraph SAC reiterate this theory. See, 
e.g., id. ¶ 10 (""During the Class Period, Defendants agreed to take many joint collective actions as part of the industry's 
overarching conspiracy that was designed to fix, raise, maintain, and/or stabilize the prices of shell eggs and egg products, 
including but not limited to significant efforts to manage and/or reduce supply.""); id. ¶ 182 (""Defendants undertook a coordinated 
effort to restrict egg supply through various means that has artificially fixed, maintained and/or stabilized egg prices to 
supracompetitive levels  [**7] throughout 2000 to the present.""); id. ¶ 517 ("" . . . Defendants and their co-conspirators engaged in 
a continuing contract, combination and conspiracy in unreasonable restraint of interstate trade and commerce in violation of 
Section 1 of the Sherman Act, which had the purpose and effect of fixing, raising, maintaining and/or stabilizing the prices of 
eggs at artificially high, non-competitive levels in the United States.""). Plaintiffs also state in their brief opposing the motions: ""the 
Complaint alleges one comprehensive conspiracy to reduce the supply of eggs implemented through a variety of separate but 
related components."" Pls.' Resp. at 34. "
1111,7," The Supreme Court has cited several examples of allegations of parallel conduct that might suggest collusion sufficient to 
allege a § 1 Sherman Act claim. Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556 n.4; see also In re Text Messaging Antitrust Litig., 630 F.3d 622, 628 
(7th Cir. 2010), cert. denied, 131 S. Ct. 2165, 179 L. Ed. 2d 937 (2011). Given the nature of the conspiracy alleged in the SAC 
and the substance of the parties' arguments, however, no further discussion of these examples is required. "
1113,8," There are several issues that this opinion does not address. For example, the Court does not confront here, or necessarily 
accept, that the SAC's allegations lead to the legal conclusion of a conspiracy, contrary to Plaintiffs' assertion that they allege 
facts of direct evidence of an actual agreement and parallel conduct suggestive of an agreement. Pls.' Resp. at 26-27. However, 
although the specific factual allegations proposing the existence of an overarching conspiracy and the ""collective actions"" in 
furtherance of the conspiracy are accepted as true for purposes of these motions, there is no basis for the Court to decide this 
issue because no motion at bar requires such a decision. Indeed, no movant has objected substantively to the sufficiency of the 
allegations of the antitrust § 1 claim generally, and  [**28] their arguments actually presume on some level that the SAC pleads a 
conspiracy and its particular parameters. Additionally, Plaintiffs make much ado about the fact that no Defendant moved to dismiss the claim of an overarching 
conspiracy, and the fact that nine Defendants have chosen to answer the SAC outright. Pls.' Resp. at 20-22. These 
circumstances are of no moment to the issues at hand. They may be anomalous in an antitrust case of this size and scope. 
Nevertheless, the Court recognizes that defendants often make strategic choices in defending litigation, and one of those 
choices includes the option, perhaps for reasons of time or expense, of answering a complaint regardless of whether it satisfies 
the pleading standard. Additionally, several of the individual Defendants argue that out of the SAC's hundreds of paragraphs, only a handful of those 
paragraphs name them specifically. They urge the Court to examine only those few paragraphs and allegations in considering 
their motions. To do so, however, would contradict the legal principles discussed, supra, that  [**29] require consideration of the 
entire conspiracy as alleged throughout a complaint rather than compartmentalizing the allegations. Finally, pervasive in their defense of the SAC is Plaintiffs' reliance on allegations that particular features of or conditions in the 
egg market favor collusion. For example, Plaintiffs place much in the figurative basket that consumer demand for eggs is 
inelastic. HN13[
] It may be that ""[i]f demand is inelastic at the current market price, collusion to raise the price will be 
particularly attractive."" Richard A. Posner, Antitrust Law 71 (2d ed. 2001). And it also may well be that ""[a]llegations that a 
market is characterized by economic factors that courts and antitrust experts and economists have found are conducive to 
collusive behavior, support an inference of plausibility."" In re Packaged Ice Antitrust Litig., 723 F. Supp. 2d 987 (E.D. Mich. 2010) "
1114,," (citing Standard Iron Works v. ArcelorMittal,, 639 F. Supp. 2d 877, 883 (N.D. Ill. 2009), In re Chocolate Confectionary Antitrust 
Litig., 602 F. Supp. 2d 538, 576 (M.D. Pa. 2009), and In re Aftermarket Filters Antitrust Litig., MDL Docket No. 1957, 2009 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 104114, 2009 WL 3754041, at *3 (N.D. Ill. Nov. 5, 2009). Nonetheless, under  [**30] the applicable legal standards, 
Plaintiffs are not absolved from specifically pleading allegations that plausibly suggest each defendant's agreement to or 
participation in the alleged conspiracy. While the Court certainly considers the alleged market conditions and their ""ripeness"" for 
collusion to be a notable factor in considering the totality of the allegations against each defendant and is cognizant of them in its 
analysis of the issues presented in the motions at bar, the Court does not find those allegations in and of themselves dispositive 
of whether an individual defendant joined or participated in the offending conspiracy."
1114,9," By a stipulation between Plaintiffs and Michael Foods, the SAC's reference in Paragraph 331 to Michael Foods as participating 
in the export program was removed from the SAC. See Stipulation (Doc. No. 432). Thus, that feature of the alleged conspiracy is 
not discussed here. "
1116,10," This is not to say Plaintiffs' characterization of the Program in the SAC is necessarily true or without legitimate explanation, but 
determinations of such inquiries are not appropriate at this time. See Standard Iron Works, 639 F. Supp. 2d at 895, 902 (""While 
more innocent inferences can be drawn from [Defendants' conduct] it is not Plaintiffs' burden to allege facts that cannot be 
squared with the possibility of unilateral action. . . . HN17[
] Whether [Defendants' actions] were benign unilateral business 
decisions made by the individual Defendants or whether they represent concerted effort in violation of the Sherman Act are 
issues of fact which [this Court] cannot decide on the pleadings and which require discovery prior to resolution.'"" (citations 
omitted)); cf. Transpacific Passenger, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 49853, 2011 WL 1753738, at *14 (""The communications discussed 
herein, as well as numerous others, might well have legitimate explanations. But, at this stage in the litigation, they seem to 
show would-be competitors discussing the raising or matching of prices.""). Moreover,  [**40] while it is possible that there are 
innocent explanations for certain features of the Program, it is not within the Court's purview to weave them out of whole cloth in 
the absence of a documented factual record. "
1117,11," Moreover, a rational individual producer would seek to maintain, if not increase, the number of hens in order to promote its egg 
supply consistent with economic theory applicable to a market where demand is inelastic. The SAC avers that the nature of 
demand for eggs is indeed inelastic. See id. ¶ 153 (""[D]emand for eggs is relatively inelastic — that is, consumers do not 
purchase fewer eggs when prices rise . . . .""); see also  [**44] id. ¶¶ 154-56. An individual profit-maximizing producer facing an 
inelastic demand curve has the incentive to maintain or increase its individual product supply in order to maintain or increase 
market share. See, e.g., Blomkest Fertilizer, Inc. v. Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan, 203 F.3d 1028, 1039 (8th Cir. 2000) 
(Gibson, J., dissenting) (""The effect of this inelastic demand is that low prices are bad for the producers because the low price 
does not result in greater sales, except insofar as one producer can take sales away from other producers."")."
1117,12," Michael Foods argues that ""conclusory assertions or accusations of an agreement not to add capacity like the [assertions] in 
[P]aragraph 208 which are unaccompanied by any factual allegations cannot state a claim against Michael Foods."" Day 1 Tr. at 
77:11-14. However, although that factual claim in Paragraph 208 uses the generic ""Defendants,"" the allegation goes on to 
describe the parameters of the UEP Certified Program's guidelines generally, and by virtue of being a certified producer, Michael 
Foods allegedly is required to follow the Program's guidelines in order to be certified. Additionally, Michael Foods' argument that it could still increase its overall number of hens by simply having more hen houses is 
also discredited by the allegations in the SAC in other ways. For one, the argument has no factual basis in the SAC because the 
pleading does not contain any allegation that  [**46] Michael Foods, or any other Defendant whose motion is pending, increased 
its hen numbers while participating in the UEP Certification Program. Notably, the SAC also alleges that producers were discouraged from building new hen houses. See, e.g, id. ¶ 256 (describing a 
July 2003 UEP newsletter articled entitled, ""Word of Caution"" which purportedly stated: ""As producers continue to reduce their 
layer house capacity to meet the UEP Animal Husbandry Guidelines, please don't make the mistake of building new facilities to 
replace the lost number of birds.""). Plaintiffs additionally allege, albeit as to years prior to Michael Foods' alleged joining the 
Certification Program, that chick hatch reduction was credited for reducing overall hen numbers. See, e.g., id. ¶¶ 258-59 
(describing an ""August 2003 editorial by Gene Gregory of UEP entitled 'Reason Why Industry Could Have Period of Profitability'"" 
articulating that ""[s]ince th[e] beginning date [of the ""hatch reduction to meet the animal husbandry guidelines"" in April 2002] the 
hatch has been reduced by 14.7 million pullets in comparison to the same period year earlier""); id. ¶ 281 (noting that a July 16, 
2004 UEP newsletter reported that ""Two  [**47] sources, one of which is the animal welfare audits, have confirmed to UEP that 
animal care certified companies have in fact reduced their hen numbers in existing houses""). "
1118,," Even assuming, arguendo, Michael Foods turned tail against the apparent trend of other certified producers' alleged reduction of 
chick hatch, and instead increased its overall hen population, the SAC's allegations still undermine Michael Foods' argument. 
The SAC suggests that there were philosophies prevalent in the egg industry that not every producer needed to engage in every 
activity geared to decrease supply in order for such a result to occur and that adding more hen housing would not be detrimental 
to achieving the alleged goal of decreasing supply. See, e.g., id. ¶ 193 (describing a document, dated August 2011, that 
Defendants allegedly distributed, which stated, ""[T]here should be a core segment of the industry that is willing to reduce egg 
supply in order to achieve profitable egg prices"" (emphasis added)); id. ¶ 305 (describing a November 15, 2004 Feedstuffs 
article that examined ""problems of oversupply and backfilling"" in the egg industry and noting that ""[c]easing to backfill houses 
would fit [Gene] Gregory's  [**48] suggestion to the [UEP] marketing committee that 'you don't need a plan to reduce the hatch; 
you don't need a moratorium on new housing: You need to get rid of old hens.'"" (alterations in original)). As such, in the world 
depicted by the SAC, the act of increasing hen numbers, even while UEP-certified, would not necessarily mean that Michael 
Foods had not consented to or participated in the alleged conspiracy. Nonetheless, when considering all aspects of the Program 
as alleged (which the Court continues to discuss, infra) and in light of the other allegations as to Michael Foods and the overall 
alleged conspiracy as pled, the Court determines that Michael Foods' participation in the UEP Certified Program—even if 
Michael Foods did increase its hen numbers—would still suggest that Michael Foods agreed to and participated in the alleged 
conspiracy."
1118,13," The facts alleged in the SAC provide no grounds for the Court to infer that a prohibition on backfilling could serve some 
possible legitimate business purpose, such as animal husbandry practices, animal welfare, or otherwise."
1118,14," Reporting and auditing practices are alleged components of the UEP Certification Program to ensure compliance with the 
Program's guidelines. Plaintiffs have alleged that such practices included certified producers self-reporting  [**50] their 
compliance in monthly compliance reports to UEP. Id. ¶¶ 232, 504. Passing an annual audit, which the SAC never directly 
describes, also appears to be a predicate to becoming and remaining certified under the Program. Id. ¶¶ 423, 428, 429. In their arguments, Plaintiffs broadly assert that the audit process was not based upon an interest in promoting animal welfare, 
and they attempt to assign some significance to the fact that there is an apparent disparity in the Program's penalties in the 
auditing process, claiming that the audits did not go to penalizing animal welfare violations, but instead to ""ensur[ing] only that 
producers were restricting supplies."" Pls.' Resp. at 11. In support, Plaintiffs contrast the guidelines on certain animal husbandry 
practices that purportedly promote humane treatment with those that ostensibly appear to promote supply restriction methods. 
They note that ""toxic ammonia concentrations, cruel killing methods and failure to remove dead birds from cages daily only cost 
producers a five (5) point deduction on their annual audit,""id. ¶ 428, whereas ""a producer automatically fails their [sic] audit if 
they [sic] violate cage spacing formulas, engage in  [**51] a procedure known as 'backfilling.'"" Id. ¶ 429. However, the SAC appears to undermine this argument because an audit failure is also the penalty for using starvation induced 
molting, which would surely seem to be an inhumane practice. Id. Generally, molting is a process employed by producers in an 
effort to obtain a higher level of egg production from a given flock of hens. Id. ¶ 130. The impact of molting is a temporary 
cessation in egg production for approximately eight weeks. Id. Following this period, ""[p]ost-molt egg production will increase 
such that peak egg production in the flock reaches about 80 percent"" for a short duration. Id. ¶ 132. As alleged in the SAC, in 
addition to starvation induced molting, producers can induce molting by ""reduc[ing] light simulation (artificial day length) and 
impos[ing] dietary feed restrictions (including limiting food and water or providing diets of low nutrient density)."" Id. ¶ 131. 
Plaintiffs contend that molting is a supply restrictive practice because it ""reduces the supply of eggs."" Id. ¶ 130. Accepting, arguendo, that the practice of molting restricts supply, it theoretically would be a desirable practice to promote 
generally in order to  [**52] advance the alleged conspiracy. However, given that Plaintiffs plead that one method of molting "
1119,," triggers an automatic audit failure—notably, the method that, at least by virtue of comparison, appears to be inhumane since it 
relies on starving hens outright—the audit penalty system does not conform to the Plaintiffs' characterization that the audit 
penalties align uniformly with the goals of the alleged conspiracy. This particular line of argument thereby does little to support 
Plaintiffs' broader argument that the audit process was not based upon an interest in promoting animal welfare. Of course, this is not to say that the auditing process might not have been used in some form to further the alleged conspiracy. 
After all, the auditing process imposes a severe penalty for backfilling, which, as the Court discussed above, has no apparent 
legitimate business purpose as pled and appears consistent with supply restriction."
1119,15," The Court recognizes that although Michael Foods participated in the UEP Certification Program,  [**54] 100% of its facilities 
may not have complied with the guidelines. Plaintiffs aver that an August 2006 UEP newsletter reported that the ""Animal Welfare 
Committee approved the use of a Non-Certified License Agreement for . . . UEP/UEA egg production companies having made a 
commitment to meet the 100% rule while in the process of implementing the cage space requirements of UEP's hatch schedule."" 
Id. ¶ 464. Because Michael Foods allegedly had a license agreement, specifically, license agreement 509 (as well as 
certification no. 345), id. ¶¶ 49, 448, it may have only made the ""commitment to meet the 100% rule."""
1119,16," The Court does not find that the SAC on its face alleges any alternative explanations for becoming certified in order to obtain 
or retain a marketing license. The Court recognizes that in 2005 the UEP's Producer Committee for Animal Welfare voted to 
approve a motion that instituted the policy ""that no new licenses to market . . . Certified eggs will be issued or renewed to 
producers who are not . . . certified."" Id. ¶ 310. According to the SAC, the language of the motion ostensibly articulated the 
purposes for doing so: specifically protecting the integrity of the Program and logo due to ""the difficulty in preventing the 
commingling of"" certified and non-certified eggs and ""to treat all egg producers equally."" Id. (""One motion stated, ""In order to "
1120,," protect the integrity of the ACC program and logo and in view of the difficulty in preventing the commingling of certified eggs with 
non-certified eggs and to treat all egg producers equally it is hereby moved . . . .""). However, a fair reading of this allegation does not  [**57] suggest that these were the Committee members' actual reasons for 
voting for the motion. Nonetheless, these ""purported"" explanations for why the Committee approved the motion cannot be 
imputed as the rationale for why companies would choose to become or remain certified in order to have marketing licenses, 
and as such, the Court does not consider them alternative explanations for seeking to obtain a marketing license."
1120,17," Ostensibly, the SAC also could be read to suggest that Wal-Mart, despite previously announcing that it would only purchase 
UEP-certified eggs as of January 1, 2003, id. ¶ 236, was one of Sparboe's active customers in 2009, apparently purchasing 
eggs from Sparboe when it was no longer UEP-certified.  [**60] See id. ¶ 248 (""In 2009 . . . UEP contacted Sparboe customer, 
Wal-Mart, in an attempt to discourage the company from purchasing Sparboe's eggs that had not been certified by the UEP."")."
1120,18," By recounting these SAC allegations, the Court is making no factual, legal or value judgments that would venture into the 
marketing or related fields or belief systems concerning ""free-range,"" ""cage free,"" ""organic,"" or other concepts advanced in 
current day agricultural production, product advertising, marketing or consumption. See also id. ¶¶ 141, 483 (recognizing such 
""specialty"" eggs are excluded from this suit). "
1121,19," In contrast, at oral argument, Plaintiffs pushed the pleading envelope and argued that they ""alleged explicitly that Daybreak 
was in the UEP certification program . . . ."" Day 2 Tr. at 34:15-18 (emphasis). "
1122,20," Notably, other producers who are alleged to have joined the certification program and have assigned certification numbers, 
such as Michael Foods, Rose Acre, and Ohio Fresh, were also alleged to have ""adopted"" the chick hatch reduction guidelines 
under the Program with the identical language of "". . . by adopting UEP Certified guidelines to reduce chick hatch."" See, e.g., 
SAC ¶¶ 48, 67, 90. Thus, ""adoption"" of certain UEP guidelines does not necessarily equate to (or foreclose) the conclusion that 
a producer has certified-status. "
1123,21," To buttress its argument, Daybreak has attempted to raise  [**69] doubt as to the truthfulness of the allegation that it adopted 
the UEP Certified guidelines on chick hatch reduction. In doing so, Daybreak asks the Court to look beyond the SAC at the 
UEP's Answer to the SAC, which states that Daybreak has never been certified under the UEP Certification Program. Daybreak 
Reply at 7. Suffice it to say, Daybreak may enlist the UEP pleading in a subsequent motion, but a co-defendant's Answer is 
unavailing in this Rule 12(b)(6) analysis of the SAC."
1123,22," The SAC alleges in separate paragraphs that the UEP Marketing Committee met in Washington, D.C., in May and October of 
2008, where the committee chairman evidently made virtually identical comments. Despite alleging that identical company 
representatives were present and the chairman's comments at both were verbatim, Plaintiffs appear to consider these were 
indeed  [**73] two separate meetings. See Pls.' Resp. at 38."
1123,23," Plaintiffs challenge the defense view that Daybreak was only a passive attendee at UEP meetings by conjuring up the 
inference that Daybreak twice voted at UEP Board meetings for producers to coordinate and reduce flock sizes. However, the "
1124,," alleged facts do not support this argument by Plaintiffs. The SAC is devoid of facts alleging that Daybreak undertook any 
coordinated actions to reduce flock sizes, so Plaintiffs implicitly argue that Daybreak's vote to approve such actions 
demonstrates its agreement to the overarching conspiracy. See Pls.' Resp. at 40 (""While Mr. Rehm was a Board member, the 
UEP twice approved coordinated actions to reduce flock sizes in order to reduce supply and to raise prices . . . . At least one 
approval was without recorded dissent.""). But such an argument is of no ultimate moment, because the SAC does not 
specifically allege, directly or by inference, that Daybreak cast an affirmative vote at any of these meetings. For example, at one 
such meeting there was a motion ""to extend through Labor Day the current 'intentions program' for members' flocks to be 
disposed of 4 weeks earlier than previously scheduled and/or  [**74] flock size reduction by 5%"" that was passed by the Board 
with ""no recorded dissents."" Id. ¶ 300. Even when considering all inferences favoring Plaintiffs, this allegation does not suggest 
Daybreak actually voted, particularly given that the UEP Board was ""governed by . . . three to fifty directors who are elected 
annually."" Id. ¶ 446. A lack of recorded dissent cannot indicate whether all Board members were able to vote on the given 
proposal or that any Board member may have abstained, temporarily left the meeting, or other ""unrecorded"" action. As such, 
Plaintiffs merely propose a very possibly false inference. Cf. Twombly, 550 U.S. at 554 (warning against ""false inferences"" in the 
context of allegations of parallel conduct without more). "
1125,24," At oral argument, the Court raised the possibility that some of Daybreak's objections to the SAC might be resolved more 
appropriately through another avenues, such as, inter alia, attempting to resolve issues concerning accuracy directly with the 
Plaintiffs or later through summary judgment. See Day 2 Tr. at 30:7-36:8. The Court is confident that the practical professionals 
managing this case could address and resolve such disputes informally. Insofar that the parties are unable to resolve any of 
these specific issues on their own, summary judgment ""as soon as sufficient evidence is developed to establish or negate a 
point"" can ""conserv[e] the resources of the parties and the courts."" 2 Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law ¶ 
307, at 99 (3d ed. 2007). Likewise, an appropriate and closely tailored  [**79] discovery plan can aid in the efficient resolution of 
these issues. See In re Polyurethane Foam Antitrust Litig., No. 10 MD 2196, 799 F. Supp. 2d 777, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 85032, 
2011 WL 3204712, at *5 (N.D. Ohio July 19, 2011) (recognizing that certain defendants ""differ[] in important respects from the 
majority of Defendants"" and thus requiring that plaintiffs confer with those defendants ""to develop a focused and phased 
discovery plan to determine whether these Defendants should remain in the case""), clarified on denial of reconsideration on 
other grounds, 799 F. Supp. 2d 777, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 104419, 2011 WL 4345926 (Sept. 15, 2011)."
1125,25," Specifically, the allegations as to Rose Acre representatives' attendance at meetings, leadership positions held, and 
conversations with other Defendants are similar, if not identical to, allegations concerning other Defendants, discussed supra. 
See, e.g., SAC ¶¶ 66-67, 231, 252, 284-85, 298, 310, 336, 353, 380, 398, 404, 438. For the same reasons, the Court concludes 
that these charges as to Rose Acre are insufficient on their own to plausibly articulate Rose Acre's agreement to the alleged 
conspiracy."
1125,26," The SAC claims that  [**81] ""Rose Acre was a member of USEM and/or participated in egg exports, sharing any associated 
financial losses with other members."" Id. ¶ 67. Rose Acre allegedly began participating in the USEM export program in late 
2006. Id. ¶ 350. The timing of Rose Acre's alleged participation in the export program coincides with the program's expansion in 
2006, following a period of three years in which no exports were facilitated by the program. Id. ¶¶ 332, 348. "
1126,27," At  [**83] times the SAC appears to misstate this phenomena, which the Court attributes to inadvertence rather than internal 
actual contradiction. See, e.g., id. ¶ 361 (""[T]he pace at which domestic U.S. prices dropped was proportional to supply . . . ."")."
1126,28," The SAC alleges other export-related price information, yet it does not provide any supporting comparative data. One such 
allegation is that the ""average European Community price for eggs in 2003 was only 110.57 euros per hundred kilograms"" and in 
2005 the average per hundred kilograms was 86.08 euros. Id. at ¶ 148. There is no similar comparative data on domestic pricing 
in the SAC to meaningfully compare European and domestic prices in that time period. "
1127,29," In contrast, for example, Plaintiffs allege, without any American comparative data, that ""egg and egg product prices [were] far 
lower in Europe than in the United States"" at a time when egg consumption in various European countries was low. See id. ¶ 
360. "
1128,30," Rose Acre does not identify the particular SAC paragraphs that allege this prohibition. As previously discussed, however, 
Plaintiffs averred that ""[a]s part of these [UEP Certified] guidelines . . . Defendants also agreed not to add capacity or make up 
for the lost hens that would result through reduced cage densities . . . ."" Id. ¶ 208."
1128,31," Twombly suggests that the Court might be able to take judicial notice pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 201 of the ""full contents of . . . 
published articles referenced in [a] complaint, from which . . . truncated quotations were drawn."" Twombly, 550 U.S. at 568 n.13. 
This suggestion appears in that case in relation to a narrow factual context where a Chicago Tribune article reported on a 
defendant-speaker's thoughts on a matter that were only selectively excerpted in the complaint, and is inapplicable to the 
scenario at bar where Rose Acre appears to proffer them to the Court for purposes of examining the content of an article 
published in an unauthenticated industry periodical. Furthermore, Rose Acre has not articulated any basis for the Court to consider these materials through  [**93] judicial notice or 
any other grounds. Rose Acre merely attached the materials to its motion and cited them to support the substance of its 
arguments. HN26[
] Without an invocation of Fed. R. Evid. 201 and a basis for applying it here, ""judicial notice remains discretionary with the trial judge,"" 21B Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 5107.1, and the 
Court adheres here to conventional Third Circuit case law in considering materials outside of a pleading. "
1129,32," By illustrative contrast, the UEP Certification guidelines are arguably integral to Plaintiffs' antitrust claim under this standard. 
But this example is purely academic because, inter alia, no Defendant has offered authenticated guidelines  [**95] in connection 
with a motion to dismiss."
1129,33," Plaintiffs appear to misconstrue this argument. In response to Rose Acre, Plaintiffs raise the unrelated issue of whether an 
antitrust conspirator needs to have participated in all aspects of the conspiracy in order to be vulnerable to liability, contending 
that ""late entry into a conspiracy does not exonerate a defendant from liability for what previously occurred."" Pls.' Resp. at 44. 
Given that Rose Acre argues that its alleged latecomer status is a factor that suggests that Rose Acre did not agree to the 
overarching conspiracy to reduce egg supply, Plaintiffs' argument as articulated is irrelevant to Rose Acre's Motion. It follows 
that the Court need not and shall not address here whether a latecomer can be liable for earlier alleged conspiratorial 
participation in a civil antitrust action, but observes that the Third Circuit Court of Appeals  [**97] may not have directly weighed 
in on this issue in all pertinent respects. See In re Lower Lake Erie Iron Ore Antitrust Litig., 710 F. Supp. 152, 153-54 (E.D. Pa. 
1989) (""[T]he general rule seems to be that civil liability, too, is unaffected by the duration of one's participation in the conspiracy. 
Whether the Third Circuit Court of Appeals would apply this 'late joinder' rule is, however, not altogether clear.""); Daniel Boone 
Area Sch. Dist. v. Lehman Bros., Inc., 187 F. Supp. 2d 400, 414 (W.D. Pa. 2002) (""[C]o-conspirators might be liable for acts 
committed prior to their joining the conspiracy."" (citation omitted)). But see Tunis Bros. Co. v. Ford Motor Co., 763 F.2d 1482, 
1491 & n.16 (3d Cir. 1985) (""Conspiracies under the Sherman Act are not dependent on any overt act other than the act of 
conspiring. . . . Those who, with knowledge of the conspiracy, aid or assist in carrying out the purposes of the conspiracy make 
themselves parties thereto and are equally liable to or guilty with the original conspirators."" (citation omitted)), vacated, 475 U.S. 
1105, 1105, 106 S. Ct. 1509, 89 L. Ed. 2d 909 (1986), remanded to 823 F.2d 49 (3d Cir. 1987). "
1130,34," See Dr. Seuss, Green Eggs and Ham (1960)."
1130,35," Additionally, the Court notes that Plaintiffs have argued that their theory as alleged does not require participation by all 
Defendants in all coordinated actions at all points throughout the time period at issue. They contend that Defendants agreed to 
manipulate supply and from there, ""looked around at the industry and the economy,"" and determined the means to best achieve 
the alleged agreement, which resulted in Defendants engaging in ""different means over the time to control  [**101] or manipulate 
supply."" Day 1 Tr. at 94:5-15. It remains to be seen at a later stage in this litigation if this theory ultimately proves too much or 
too little, such as if the evidence eventually discloses so many different, differing, and distinct acts by the various remaining 
Defendants that no image of a defined ""conspiracy"" emerges. Additionally, the Court also notes that while Ohio Fresh appears to raise a latecomer-esque argument in simple chronological 
terms, its claims in this regard do not have the same implications as Rose Acre's latecomer argument. The Court does not here 
credit Ohio Fresh with authentic latecomer status for purposes of trying to avoid potential liability. "
1131,36," Similarly, as Plaintiffs argue, consideration of the Ohio Fresh's argument would require consideration of whether Ohio Fresh 
complied with the orders and to what extent its conduct is connected to the orders, which would be inappropriate at the motion to 
dismiss stage. See Pls.' Resp. at 64 n.22; see also S. Cross Overseas Agencies, Inc. v. Wah Kwong Shipping Grp. Ltd., 181 
F.3d 410, 426 (3d Cir. 1999) (""Specifically, HN28[
] on a motion to dismiss, we may take judicial notice of another court's 
opinion—not for the truth of the facts recited therein, but for the existence of the opinion, which is not subject to reasonable 
dispute over its authenticity."" (citations omitted)). "
1132,37," Hillandale Farms of Pa., Inc., is also a named Defendant and chose  [**110] to answer the SAC. See Answer (Doc. No. 246). "
1135,38," The Hillandale Entities argue that the vagueness of ""vertical integration"" is akin to that of ""governing sponsor,"" used by the 
plaintiffs in Jung v. Association of American Medical Colleges, 300 F. Supp. 2d 119. Indeed, there are parallels between the 
terms. With respect to ""governing sponsor"" the Jung Court found: [The] meaning of the term ""governing sponsor""  [**120] is far from self-evident, and plaintiffs do not make any assertions 
with respect to what role governing sponsors play for [other individual defendants]. The Court will not speculate as to the 
purpose or activities of a ""governing sponsor"" or infer from this vague term that [an alleged sponsor engaged in certain 
alleged conduct] . . . . While all inferences are to be drawn in favor of plaintiffs on a motion to dismiss, the Court will not 
draw inferences from such vague, unsupported allegations."" Id. at 163. "
1136,39," HN32[
] ""Leave to amend must generally be granted unless equitable considerations render it otherwise unjust."" Arthur v. Maersk, Inc., 434 F.3d 196, 204 (3d Cir. 2006) (citing Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S. Ct. 227, 9 L. Ed. 2d 222 (1962), 
and Lorenz v. CSX Corp., 1 F.3d 1406, 1414 (3d Cir. 1993)). The Hillandale  [**124] Entities urge the Court to dismiss the SAC 
with prejudice and without leave to amend the complaint, arguing that ""[t]o allow Plaintiffs to amend their Complaint yet again, 
imposing still more expense and delay on the Moving Defendants for their own failures to plead, would not be fair to the Moving 
Defendants, to the other parties in this suit, or to the Court."" Hillandale Entities Mot. at 11. At this juncture, while acknowledging 
that such arguments are not unexpected and are not without certain objective merit, the Court does not find that these 
arguments provide sufficient grounds to weigh against granting Plaintiffs leave to seek to amend the claims against the 
Hillandale Entities. Of course, the Court would expect any new effort by Plaintiffs to amend as to any of the Hillandale Entities

of—or all of—them in the SAC."
1136,40," There is a conflict in the SAC concerning the UEA's state of incorporation. In contrast to Paragraph 108, Paragraph 178 
alleges that UEA is an ""organization existing under the laws of Georgia."" Id. ¶ 178. At oral argument, however, UEA's counsel 
noted that UEA was organized in the District of Columbia. Day 2 Tr. at 145:6-8. "

a comparative review of any proposed version, they should also attach as an exhibit a ""redline version"" inline tracking any

Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Defendants' Motion to Dismiss the Amended Complaint (""Pls.' Opp'n""); and ECF No. 20, 
Reply Memorandum of Law In Support of  [*3] Defendants' Motion to Dismiss the Amended Complaint (""Defs.' Reply"")."
1143,2," Because adjudication of defendants' motion to dismiss requires context regarding the accounting profession, peer review of 
CPAs and the role of the AICPA, sections B and C herein provide relevant background facts pleaded in the Amended Complaint, 
while sections D and E set forth the alleged facts immediately underlying plaintiffs' claims. "
1144,3," The State of New York recently enacted New York Education Law § 7410, which makes peer review mandatory for CPAs, but 
the law does not go into effect until January 1, 2012. (Am. Compl. ¶ 112.)"
1144,4," The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 created the PCAOB, which is charged with the oversight, regulation, inspection, and discipline 
of American and foreign accounting firms that audit public companies. (Id. ¶ 21.) "
1145,5," As noted in the Amended Complaint, the reviewed firms have been assigned fictitious names. (Id. ¶¶ 128, 133, 138, 142.)"
1145,6," Plaintiffs allege that Colabella was suspended from engaging in ""any further [p]eer [r]eviews"" in the State of New York and 
elsewhere due to the issuance of notices from Bronsky and Morris. (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 156, 172.) Those allegations do not make 
sense in light of other facts pleaded in the Amended Complaint, namely, that firms registered with the PCAOB must undergo 
peer reviews routinely (id. ¶ 52.G), and that all CPAs for whom peer review is mandatory and who ""are not registered and 
supervised by the PCAOB"" must be peer-reviewed by AICPA through NYSSCPA (id. ¶¶ 114-18, 195) (emphasis added). The 
well-pleaded allegations indicate that peer reviews in New York State are conducted by at least two organizations: PCAOB and "
1146,," NYSSCPA. Plaintiffs have not pled any relationship between PCAOB and AICPA or NYSSCPA, such that suspension under 
NYSSCPA's PRP would foreclose Colabella's ability to perform peer reviews for another organization such as PCAOB.

Dow Chem. Co., 517 F.3d 104, 115 (2d Cir. 2008), while disregarding allegations that are not well-pleaded, the court accepts as 
fact that Colabella was suspended only from engaging in any further peer reviews on behalf of AICPA and NYSSCPA as a result 
of the notices issued by Bronsky and Morris."
1146,7," Contrary to Colabella's assertion that the CPE Credit Summary reflects that he earned ""in excess of 273 hours of total 
continuing education, in excess of 127 hours of which were in satisfaction of the 80 hour requirement . . . and 100 hours of which 
were in satisfaction of the 24 hour government auditing requirement,"" the CPE Credit Summary instead shows that as of July 10, 
2008 (the date on which Colabella furnished the CPE Credit Summary to Bronsky), plaintiff had earned 208.5 hours of total 
continuing education; 82.5 hours in satisfaction of the ""80-hour requirement""; and 80 hours in satisfaction of the ""24-hour 
government auditing requirement."" (CPE Credit Summary.) The CPE Credit Summary accounts for continuing education credits 
accrued between August 5, 2005, and November 15, 2009, but the court will  [*15] consider only data on the CPE Credit 
Summary that reflects hours accrued as of July 10, 2008, because the court ""need not feel constrained to accept as truth

1146,8," Colabella alleges that by recommending that his peer-review reports be accepted, the Ad Hoc Committee implicitly 
acknowledged that his work product conformed to AICPA standards. (Am. Compl. ¶ 183.) A September 2, 2008 letter from "
1147,," Susan  [*18] Lieberum, writing on behalf of the AICPA PRP, makes clear, however, that AICPA directed NYSSCPA to accept 
Colabella's report--notwithstanding the errors therein--for the sake of the reviewed firm, and that he should be given feedback 
regarding the outstanding errors. (ECF No. 19, Affidavit of Virgil W. Webb (""Webb Aff.""), Ex. 2, September 2, 2009 letter from 
Susan Lieberum (""Lieberum Letter"").)"
1147,9," Although plaintiffs allege that peer reviews of CPAs in the State of New York are administrated solely by AICPA through 
NYSSCPA (see Am. Compl. ¶ 113), the court does not accept this allegation as true for purposes of this motion because it is 
contradicted by other  [*21] statements in the Amended Complaint, and as explained supra, the Court ""need not feel constrained 
to accept as truth conflicting pleadings that make no sense . . . or that are contradicted either by statements in the complaint 
itself or by documents upon which its pleadings rely."" In re Livent, 151 F. Supp. 2d at 405. The Amended Complaint also states "
1148,," that CPAs in New York who are ""not registered and supervised by the PCAOB"" must submit to peer review conducted by AICPA 
through NYSSCPA. (Am. Compl. 114-18.) If CPAs in New York could only be peer-reviewed through the PRP administered by 
AICPA and NYSSCPA, the specific PCAOB-related allegations would be superfluous. "
1151,10," As alleged in the Amended Complaint, PCAOB also conducts peer reviews, as discussed supra. (See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 114-18.) "

1154,12," The court notes that plaintiffs' reliance on a five-factor test articulated by the Second Circuit in Jackson v. Statler Found., 496 
F.2d 623 (2d Cir. 1973),  [*46] to support their claim that the Amended Complaint adequately alleges state action (see Pls.' 
Opp'n at 14) is misplaced. In Statler, the Second Circuit laid out ""five factors which are particularly important to a determination 
of 'state action': (1) the degree to which the 'private' organization is dependent on governmental aid; (2) the extent and 
intrusiveness of the governmental regulatory scheme; (3) whether that scheme connotes government approval of the activity or 
whether the assistance is merely provided to all without such connotation; (4) the extent to which the organization serves a 
public function or acts as a surrogate for the State; (5) whether the organization has legitimate claims to recognition as a 'private' 
organization in associational or other constitutional terms."" 496 F.2d at 629. The Supreme Court later ""tightened the proof 
required for a showing of state action,"" rendering the Jackson analysis inapposite. Fulani v. League of Women Voters Educ. 
Fund, 684 F. Supp. 1185, 1191 (S.D.N.Y. 1988); see also Blum, 457 U.S. at 1011 (government may subsidize private entities 
without assuming constitutional responsibility for their actions); Rendell-Baker, 457 U.S. at 842  [*47] (private entity's 
performance of a function that serves the public does not make its acts governmental action); Jackson, 419 U.S. at 350 
(extensive regulation by the government does not transform the actions of the regulated entity into those of the government)). "
1174,1," Defendants also argue that ""a plaintiff must show that he had a 'reasonable expectation of payment from the defendants' in 
return for the alleged benefit. "" See Motion at 22 (quoting Scully Signal Co. v. Joyal, 881 F. Supp. 727, 745 (D.R.I. 1995)). This 
appears to be a misstatement of the law; the source cited by Scully Signal sets forth a different standard. See Commercial 
Associates v. Tilcon Gammino, Inc., 998 F.2d 1092, 1100-01 (1st Cir. 1993) (""To recover on a theory of unjust enrichment under 
Rhode Island law, the plaintiff must show that it conferred a benefit on the defendant 'in such circumstances that it would be 
inequitable for the defendant to retain the benefit without payment to the plaintiff for the value thereof.'""). "
1176,2," Plaintiffs do not seek to recover under the antitrust laws of Missouri or Rhode Island. Rather, they assert  [*56] unfair 
competition and unjust enrichment claims under the laws of those states. "
1179,1," The facts are set forth in the light most favorable to Carpenter, the non-moving party."
1179,2," The letter states in part: It has come to our attention that companies involved in the manufacture of ingots, forgings, or gas turbines may be 
considering either the manufacture, use, or sale of product using large diameter triple-melted 718 nickel alloy ingots greater

use, and sale of such large diameter nickel-base ingots. Letter dated Nov. 14, 2003, Ex. C to Am. Compl. "
1180,3," Sam Thamboo is a GE employee. The 2001 Thamboo article explains that GE's ""F class turbines,"" which were designed in the 
1980's, utilized turbine wheels made of Alloy 706 ingots. See Thamboo, et al, at 58 It further states GE's ""new FB and H 
machines now employ even higher firing temperatures than the F class machines to achieve even better turbine efficiency. 
These temperatures exceed the capacity of alloy 706; therefore, alloy 718 has been chosen for the turbine wheels."" It stated in 
conclusion that ""the latest turbine designs require larger disks  [*7] and therefore, larger diameter ingots of alloy 718."""
1180,4," The Sherman Act imposes liability on ""[e]very person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire

fraud elements of Carpenter's Walker Process claim."
1181,6," Dr. McChesney is a Professor at Northwestern University Law School and at the Kellogg School of Management. He has a ID. 
and a Ph.D. in economics. ATI does not dispute that Dr. McChesney is qualified to render an expert opinion with respect to the 
antitrust  [*12] issues in this case. "
1182,7," This number was provided in Dr. McChesney's second supplemental report, in which he revises the damages calculation in his 
first revised report. This memorandum will refer only to the figures provided in Dr. McChesney's second report, as those

product, was foreclosed from competing with solely due to ATI's threats of patent enforcement.) "
1186,10," There is a presumption in favor of multibrand markets that may be overcome, but only with evidence that ""defendant's own 
products are so unique or so dominant in the market in which they compete that any action by the manufacturer to increase his 
control over his product virtually assures that competition in the market will be destroyed."" Areeda & Hovenkamp, ANTITRUST 
LAW § 563d. "
1188,11," In support of this conclusion, Dr. Beutel cites ATI internal documents, a conversation with ATI employee Art Kracke, and 
deposition testimony of GE employee Douglas Paul, who confirmed that material costs affect the price for large diameter 718 
ingots."
1188,12," Carpenter cites the testimony of its 30(b)(6) witness Russell Reber, who testified that GE (which is not a party to this case) has 
been injured because it is ""paying a price for the product that would - - that is much higher than it otherwise would be if there 
was more efficient competition in the marketplace"" and that the profits for ATI's  [*39] 718 ingots were double the profits 
Carpenter earned for 706 ingots. Reber Dep. 12:25-13:3.; 14:17-20. This unsubstantiated opinion testimony is not sufficient to 
carry Carpenter's burden. "
1201,1," The Special Master also issued two other reports: (1) a Report and Recommendation of the Special Master Regarding 
Summary Judgment on Counts I and III of GSRG's Amended Complaint (""First Report"") (Doc. #188) in which he recommended 
that the court grant summary judgment to Defendants Casey Equipment Corporation and Gadsden Industrial Park, LLC 
(""Casey/Park""); and (2) a Report and Recommendation of the Special Master (""Second Report"") in which he recommended that 
Plaintiff be permitted to supplement the Rule 56 record in this case but indicated that his recommendation in the First Report 
would not be changed after consideration of the new evidence. (Doc. #207). However, except to the extent that the 
recommendations in the Special Master's First and Second Reports affects the court's analysis of the claims against Nucor, 
those reports are moot. Plaintiff voluntarily dismissed its claims against Casey/Park, leaving Nucor the sole remaining 
Defendant. (Doc. #209). Accordingly, only those aspects of those Reports that dealt with Nucor's liability are at issue here. And 
that analysis has been re-adopted by the Special Master in his Third Report. (Doc. #249 at 3)."
1201,2," Although the background and facts of this case are novel, as will be seen below, the elements Plaintiff must establish are well-
established and analyzed both in the Special Master's Report and herein. "
1202,3," This is the case despite GSRG's previous repeated assertions  [**5] - to this court, the Eleventh Circuit, and the Supreme Court 
- that Nucor is a monopolist. See, e.g., Opposition to Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment at 4, Gulf States 
Reorganization Group, Inc. v. Nucor Corp., No. 02-2600 (N.D. Ala. 2005) (""propounding . . . well established principals [sic] of

""social cost[s]"" of ""protecting the marketplace from the negative effects of abuse of monopoly power"" (emphasis added)); 
Appellant's Corrected Brief at 24, Gulf States Reorganization Group, Inc. v. Nucor Corp., 466 F.3d 961, 965 (11th Cir. 2006), 
(No. 05-15976) (contending ""there is but one producer in the market""); see Respondents' Brief in Opposition to the Petition for 
Writ of Certiorari at 3, Nucor Corp. v. Gulf States Reorganization Group, Inc., 551 U.S. 1103, 127 S. Ct. 2920, 168 L. Ed. 2d 244 
(2007) (No. 06-1383 (arguing that ""this case is about suppression of potential competition by a monopolist"" (internal quotation 
marks and brackets omitted)  [**6] (emphasis added)). To the contrary, GSRG's original Complaint never asserted any unambiguous claim of actual monopolization under the Sherman 
Act, Section 2. Nevertheless, GSRG repeatedly argued an ""actual monopolization"" theory at each prior stage of this litigation. 
Indeed, the court of appeals, in reversing this court's order granting summary judgment to Defendants, appeared to understand 
(or perhaps misunderstand) that GSRG's case arose from actual monopolization under Section 2. See Gulf States 
Reorganization Group, Inc., 466 F.3d at 965 (understanding GSRG to have ""alleged that . . . Nucor violated Section 2 of the 
Sherman Act, prohibiting monopolization""); id. (stating that GSRG ""alleges that Nucor enjoys a monopoly in the relevant 
market""); id. at 969 (Cudahy, J., concurring in part and, perhaps, dissenting in part) (discussing GSRG's allegation that Nucor 
sought ""to protect its 85 percent market share and hence its effective monopoly""). Moreover, the panel (or at least the concurring 
judge) appears to have based its conclusions about causation and antitrust standing on the premise that Nucor enjoyed a 
monopoly and therefore caused GSRG's antitrust injury by participating in  [**7] the court-supervised bankruptcy auction to 
protect that monopoly. See id. at 969 (Cudahy, J., concurring in part and, perhaps, dissenting in part) (describing the case as 
""about suppression of potential competition by a monopolist""); id. at 970 (stating that ""Nucor and its co-conspirators allegedly 
took an action having the effect of excluding [GSRG] from the market and maintaining Nucor's monopoly, which injured [GSRG] 
and is the source of its damages""). In its First Amended Complaint, filed five years after this litigation began, GSRG has now 
unambiguously abandoned any claim of actual monopolization under the Sherman Act, Section 2. "
1203,4," GSRG also requested oral argument on its objections to the Special Master's Fourth  [**10] Report, but the court deems further 
argument unnecessary. Therefore, GSRG's Requests (Docs. #318, 319) are due to be denied."
1203,5," ""As of December 1, 2010, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(a) now contains the summary judgment standard. It reads, in 
pertinent part, '[t]he court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material 
fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.'"" Gortemoller v. Int'l Furniture Mktg., Inc., 434 Fed. Appx. 861, 
2011 U.S. App. LEXIS 14976, 2011 WL 2899338 at *2 n.2 (11th Cir. July 20, 2011). Because the motions for summary judgment 
were filed, and the Special Master's Reports and Recommendations were issued, prior  [**12] to December 2010, we apply the 
version of the rule effective during that time. See Gortemoller, 2011 U.S. App. LEXIS 14976, 2011 WL 2899338, at *2 n.2; see 
also Siggers v. Campbell, 652 F.3d 681, 2011 WL 3134354 n.6 (6th Cir. 2011). "
1204,6," GSRG has flatly misstated the law in suggesting that antitrust conspiracy cases ""are [still] particularly ill-suited to disposition on 
motions for summary judgment."" (Doc. #251 at 28). The Supreme Court's subsequent decisions in Monsanto and Matsushita 
effectively disavowed the broad language  [**14] from its 1962 opinion in Poller v. Columbia Broad Sys., Inc., 368 U.S. 464, 82 
S. Ct. 486, 7 L. Ed. 2d 458 (1962), on which GSRG relies. See e.g., Wallace v. SMC Pneumatics, Inc., 103 F.3d 1394, 1396 (7th 
Cir. 1997) (""In antitrust law . . . early decisions pronouncing it a field inapt for summary judgment were later repudiated.""). "
1206,7," HN9[
] ""Unlike an ordinary witness . . . an expert is permitted wide latitude to offer opinions, including those that are not 
based on firsthand knowledge or observation."" Daubert, 509 U.S. at 592. ""[T]his relaxation of the usual requirement of firsthand 
knowledge . . . is premised on an assumption that the expert's opinion will have a reliable basis in the knowledge and experience 
of his discipline."" Id. A trial court assessing the reliability of an expert's evidence must therefore perform a ""gatekeeping"" function 
by conducting ""a preliminary assessment of whether the reasoning or methodology underlying the testimony is scientifically valid 
and of whether that reasoning or methodology properly can be applied to the facts in issue."" Id. at 592-93.  [**20] The Eleventh 
Circuit has offered district courts the following general guidance in determining whether to admit scientific evidence under 
Daubert: Given time, information, and resources, courts may only admit the state of science as it is. Courts are cautioned not to 
admit speculation, conjecture, or inference that cannot be supported by sound scientific principles. ""The courtroom is not 
the place for scientific guesswork, even of the inspired sort. Law lags science; it does not lead it."" Rider v. Sandoz Pharms. Corp., 295 F.3d 1194, 1202 (11th Cir. 2002) (quoting Rosen v. Ciba-Geigy Corp., 78 F.3d 316, 319 
(7th Cir. 1996)). This same analysis applies to expert testimony in the area of economics."
1206,8," On June 1, 2010, GSRG moved for leave to submit a supplemental filing addressing a new Supreme Court antitrust case, 
American Needle, Inc. v. National Football League, 130 S.Ct. 2201, 176 L. Ed. 2d 947 (2010). GSRG asserts that American 
Needle is ""directly relevant to the issues raised in the pending Motion for Summary Judgment filed by Nucor."" (Doc. #297 at 2). 
Nucor responded  [**23] to GSRG's Supplemental Brief by stating that although it had no objection to American Needle being "
1207,," considered as supplemental authority, GSRG's supplemental brief ""misrepresents the issue decided in American Needle."" (Doc. 
#299 at 1). The court agrees with Nucor. The sole question addressed by American Needle was whether the defendants in that 
case were ""capable of engaging in a 'contract, combination . . ., or conspiracy' as defined by Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 
U.S.C. § 1 . . . ."" American Needle, 130 S.Ct. at 2208 (emphasis added). There is no question that Nucor and Casey/Park are 
separate entities which would be legally capable of conspiring under Section 1. Thus, the holding of American Needle really has 
no application here. Nonetheless, some of the analysis employed by the Supreme Court in American Needle reiterates legal principles which support 
the Special Master's conclusions in this case. For example, ""[n]ot every instance of cooperation between two people is a 
potential 'contract, combination . . ., or conspiracy, in restraint of trade'"" and ""therefore, an arrangement must embody concerted 
action in order to be a 'contract, combination . . . or conspiracy' under § 1.""  [**24] Id. at 2208-09 (emphasizing the distinction 
between an agreement and whether it embodies concerted action). These principles are consistent with and, in fact, support the 
Special Master's conclusion that the ""contract"" between Nucor and Casey/Park does not, in and of itself, establish a ""contract, 
combination . . ., or conspiracy, in restraint of trade"" under Section 1. ""[T]here is not necessarily concerted action simply 
because more than one legally distinct entity is involved."" American Needle, 130 S.Ct. at 2209. As explained at the outset of the 
opinion in American Needle, ""[t]he question [of] whether an arrangement is a contract, combination, or conspiracy is different 
from and antecedent to the question whether it unreasonably restrains trade."" Id. at 2206."
1207,9," That is, even before he issued his Third Report, the Special Master considered Casey/Park's motion for summary judgment in 
this case. (Doc. #118). After affording the parties the opportunity to present additional evidence or arguments, and after 
conducting an in-person meeting (Doc. #188 at 2), the Special Master issued his Report and Recommendation. (Doc. #188). In 
his Report, the Special Master recommended that summary judgment be granted in favor of Casey/Park both as to GSRG's 
Section 1 claim (id. at 16-20) and Section 2 conspiracy claim (id. at 20-21). GSRG filed objections and also moved to 
supplement the Rule 56 record. (Doc. #199). The motion to supplement the record was referred to the Special Master (Doc. 
#205), and thereafter the Special Master filed another Report and Recommendation. In that Report, the Special Master 
recommended that GSRG be permitted to supplement the Rule 56 record with a contract between Casey and Zibo Wanji 
Section Co., Inc. of Shandog, China. (Doc. #207 at 2). Casey/Park objected to the supplementation, and also proffered a 
different contract, this one between  [**27] Casey and ACS International. (Id.). GSRG did not challenge that supplementation. 
(Id.). After permitting supplementation of the record, the Special Master concluded that such supplementation of the record did 
not alter his recommendation that Casey/Park be granted summary judgment. (Id. at 3-4) (""the Chinese contract does not show 
that Casey/Park joined with or surrendered its 'resources, rights, or economic power' to Nucor as required for Section 1 claims 
[Virginia Vermiculite, Ltd. v. Historic Green Springs, Inc., 307 F.3d 277 (4 th Cir. 2002)], nor does the Chinese contract 
demonstrate that Casey/Park and Nucor had formed 'a conscious commitment to a common scheme designed to achieve an 
unlawful objective.'"" [Monsanto, 465 U.S. at 764.]. Although GSRG argues that the Chinese contract shows that Casey/Park "
1208,," reaped ""supranormal profits"" on the deal [Doc. #199 at 3], the agreement cannot reasonably be read to prove that Casey/Park 
had a stake in whether Nucor would be successful in achieving or maintaining monopoly power in the hot rolled coil market.""). [7 
P. Areeda & H. Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law, ¶ 1474(a) (2007)]. The court fully agrees with both components of the Special 
Master's  [**28] recommendation: (1) it is appropriate to supplement the record, but (2) that supplemented Rule 56 evidence 
does not preclude summary judgment in this case."
1208,10," In Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir. 1981) (en banc), the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals adopted 
as binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down prior to the close of business on September 30, 1981. "
1209,11," Throughout its opinion, the panel referred to GSRG as ""the Group."""
1209,12," Legally and logically, the court of appeals did not - and could not - hold that an exclusion of GSRG, standing alone, was ""in 
restraint of trade."" As the Special Master pointed out in his First Report (Doc. #188 at 12), the exact same ""exclusion"" could have 
arisen if Casey/Park and anyone other than Nucor had purchased the assets, but such purchase  [**34] by anyone other than an 
alleged monopolist would not have caused the injury to competition necessary for an antitrust violation."
1209,13," As the panel also stated: Our intention is to express no opinion at all with respect to the merits-i.e., whether the actions of appellees substantially 
lessened competition in the relevant market and violated the antitrust laws. See note 4, supra. Thus, we express no opinion 
with respect to the remarks in Judge Cudahy's separate opinion, except to say that we agree with Judge Cudahy that if the 
Group proves on remand that ""Nucor substantially lessened competition in the relevant market"" for hot rolled coil, the 
Group will  [**35] have proved a violation of the antitrust laws. However, we express no opinion on that issue; we prefer for 
the district court to conduct the appropriate analysis in the first instance and on a more fully developed record. Nor do we "
1210,," intend to express an opinion on or preempt the district court's discretion with respect to the nature of the appropriate course 
of action on remand, e.g., immediate trial or further summary judgment proceedings. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(d). Id. at 969, n. 7 (emphasis added)."
1210,14," 7  [**40] Areeda at ¶ 1474 at 307. Unilateral action is ""unlawful under the Sherman Act when anti competitive conduct is 
accompanied by monopoly power or its prospect."" Id. at 307-08."
1210,15," For example, the Special Master defined the elements as follows: Thus, the elements of a Section 1 claim are widely recognized to be (i) the existence of a contract, combination, or 
conspiracy among two or more separate entities that (ii) unreasonably restrains trade and (iii) affects interstate or foreign 
commerce. "
1211,, (Doc. #188 at 3 (footnote omitted)).
1211,16," However, HN15[
] while concerted action must be shown, not every agreement that restrains competition will violate the 
Sherman Act. The Supreme Court long ago determined that Section 1 prohibits only those agreements that unreasonably 
restrain competition, Standard Oil Co. v. United States, 221 U.S. 1, 58-64, 31 S. Ct. 502, 55 L. Ed. 619 (1911); therefore, the 
unreasonableness of the agreement is the second element of a Section 1 claim. "
1213,17," Again, although Casey/Park have resolved their differences with GSRG, the question of whether they can be liable under 
Section 1 is still at the forefront. This is the case because Plaintiff's theory for holding Nucor liable under Section 1 is the claim 
that Nucor and Casey/Park conspired with one another.SE"
1213,18," Contrary to GSRG's assertion, the Special Master's legal analysis is plainly not misdirected advocacy expounding on ""why . . . 
'pawns' are not liable for their conduct."" (See Doc. #190 at 23-24). What GSRG misunderstands (or perhaps fails to 
acknowledge) is that the Special Master's ""pawn liability"" analysis is simply another way to analyze the courts' respective 
decisions in Copperweld and Virginia Vermiculite. (Doc. #188 at 5-6) (citing 7 P. Areeda, ANTITRUST LAW, ¶1474 (2007)). The 
key point is this - if GSRG's analysis is correct, Section 1 liability  [**49] would potentially attach to a broad range of ancillary 
service providers - bankers, lenders, lawyers, and accountants to mention a few - who lack the requisite competitive interest and 
stake in the relevant market and who do not have any conscious commitment to achieve the alleged restraint of trade in that 
market."
1213,19," To be clear, while Areeda considers that an essential element of proving pawn liability is a showing that the pawn intended to 
restrain trade, id. at ¶ 1474, p. 308, the Special Master recognized that this requirement is inconsistent with Eleventh Circuit 
precedent. (Doc. #188 at 6, n.31). If this court were writing on a clean slate, it would conclude Areeda has the better reasoned 
position. However, the Eleventh Circuit's case law is clear and the Special Master applied it faithfully."
1213,20," GSRG's  [**52] objections do not challenge the Special Master's determination that GSRG failed to provide substantial 
evidence that Nucor and Casey/Park ever ""join[ed] their resources, rights, or economic power together in order to achieve an 
outcome that, but for the concert, would naturally be frustrated by their competing interests (by way of profit-maximizing 
choices)."" (Doc. #249 at 12, quoting Virginia Vermiculite Ltd., 307 F.3d at 282). This requisite combination of rights, resources or 
economic power can only occur when the combination ""diminshe[s] competing interests of the two entities."" (Doc. #188 at 8, 
quoting Virginia Vermiculite Ltd., 307 F.3d at 283). The Special Master restated this principle somewhat differently: concerted 
activity is unlawful under Section 1 if it ""deprives the marketplace of the independent centers of decision-making that competition 
assumes and demands."" First Report at 6 (quoting Copperweld Corp., 467 U.S. at 769). "
1214,21," The claim that Nucor exploited its otherwise routine business arrangement with Casey/Park to effect an anticompetitive result - 
in a market in which Casey did not participate - simply does not transform that ordinary business arrangement into an antitrust 
 [**53] conspiracy."
1214,22," It is not surprising, therefore, that GSRG has not cited to a single case upholding a Section 1 claim based on an agreement 
between an agent (i.e., a pawn) who does not participate in or have any economic interest in the state of competition in the 
relevant market and a single principal that operates in that market. Extending Section 1 under circumstances like this to parties 
outside the relevant market would dramatically alter the scope of the antitrust laws by ""presag[ing] liability for a host of servicing 
agents only fortuitously connected with Sherman Act defendants."" Golden, 475 F.2d at 290."
1214,23," The former Fifth Circuit noted over thirty years ago the infrequency of an antitrust case with direct evidence: [A] major factual question in this case is whether there was a conspiracy. Even a successful antitrust plaintiff will seldom be 
able to offer a direct evidence of a conspiracy and such evidence is not a requirement. See, e.g., Norfolk Monument Co. v. 
Woodlawn Memorial Gardens, Inc., 394 U.S. 700, 703-04, 89 S. Ct. 1391, 22 L. Ed. 2d 658 (1969). However, to survive a 
motion for summary judgment the evidence must suggest reasonable inferences of conspiracy. First National Bank of 
Arizona v. Cities Service Co., 391 U.S. 253, 266-70, 88 S. Ct. 1575, 20 L. Ed. 2d 569 (1968); American Telephone & 
Telegraph Co. v. Delta Communications Corp., 590 F.2d 100, 102 (5th Cir. 1979),  [**55] cert. denied, 444 U.S. 926, 100 S. 
Ct. 265, 62 L. Ed. 2d 182 (1979). ""Rarely, if ever, can a plaintiff point to a 'smoking gun' in (conspiracy) cases such as this. 
Yet, a plaintiff must convince the court that it is reasonable to infer the existence of the gun from the facts shown."" Aladdin 
Oil Co. v. Texaco, Inc., 603 F.2d 1107, 1117 (5th Cir. 1979). General Chemicals, Inc. v. Exxon Chemical, 625 F.2d 1231, 1233 (5th Cir. 1980). "
1215,24," Not only is the contract between Casey/Park not direct evidence of a Section 1 violation, for the reasons already explained, it 
does not provide ""circumstantial"" evidence of Casey's conscious commitment to monopolize the alleged relevant hot rolled coil 
steel market. GSRG's contention otherwise cannot withstand analysis under the well-established antitrust summary judgment 
standard that circumstantial evidence ""must be strong in order to survive summary judgment, because 'antitrust law limits the 
range of permissible inferences from ambiguous evidence in a § 1 case,'"" Tunica Web Advertising v. Tunica Casino Operators 
Ass'n, Inc., 496 F.3d 403, 409 (5th Cir. 2007) (quoting Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 588 (emphasis added)). The key point here is that 
""conduct as consistent  [**56] with permissible competition as with illegal conspiracy does not, standing alone, support an 
inference of antitrust conspiracy."" Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 588 (citing Monsanto, 465 U.S. at 764). Imposing Section 1 liability on 
the basis of conduct that is ""consistent with conspiracy, but just as much in line with a wide swath of rational and competitive 
business strategy,"" Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 554, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007), would ""often [] 
deter procompetitive conduct,"" Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 593."
1215,25," Plaintiff argues that the context of this case involves an ""anticompetitive acquisition which is accomplished by means of an 
express, written contract with a third party."" (Doc. #251 at 8). Plaintiff's argument is off the mark. And not surprisingly, GSRG has 
offered no precedent or authority whatsoever to support its  [**58] position that Section 1 criminal and treble damages liability 
may be automatically imposed on ancillary service providers that have no knowledge, stake or interest regarding another party's 
alleged anticompetitive objective."
1215,26," GSRG's lengthy analysis (Doc. #251 at 11-13) of the Third Circuit's decision in Fineman v. Armstrong World Indus., Inc., 980 
F.2d 171 (3d Cir. 1992), misstates both the holding and the facts of that case. As the Special Master correctly noted in his First 
Report, Fineman stands for the proposition that, in order to be liable under Section 1, ""co-conspirators need not share the same 
motive for the restraint of trade so long as they both share the objective to restrain trade."" (Doc. #188 at 14 (original emphasis); 
accord Doc. #249 at 9). Indeed, Fineman expressly confirms the Special Master's discussion of ""objective"" - as opposed to 
motive and intent. See Fineman, 980 F.2d at 212 (although motives may differ, a Section 1 claim requires proof that alleged 
conspirators must share a ""conscious commitment to a common scheme designed to achieve an unlawful objective.""). In this 
manner, the Special Master's analysis is wholly consistent with Eleventh Circuit law, and  [**59] contrary to GSRG's assertions, 
the Fineman opinion also confirms the Special Master's ruling that: ""At a minimum, a determination of a common objective to 
restrain trade would require the Court to find that the subordinate party has knowledge of the principal party's anticompetitive 
goal and acquiesce in its realization."" (Doc. #249 at 10 (emphasis added)). "
1216,27," GSRG takes issue with the Special Master's statement that ""[t]he written agreement between Casey/Park and Nucor . . . 
appears neutral on its face."" (Doc. #190 at 20; see also id. at 12-14). Each provision  [**60] of that agreement questioned by 
GSRG, however, readily can be explained as part of an entirely reasonable and appropriate business deal, and accordingly 
provides no evidence that tends to exclude the possibility that the agreement derived from legitimate business conduct, which 
resulted in multi-million-dollar profits for Casey/Park upon resale of the key Gulf States Steel assets."
1216,28," Citing its earlier decision in First National Bank v. Cities Service Co., 391 U.S. 253, 288-89, 88 S. Ct. 1575, 20 L. Ed. 2d 569 
(1968), the Court in Matsushita identified two separate inquiries that are relevant to this issue: (1) whether the defendant had 
""any rational motive"" to join the alleged conspiracy, and (2) whether the defendant's conduct was consistent with the defendant's 
independent interest,"" Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 587, citing 391 U.S. 253, 88 S. Ct. 1575, 20 L. Ed. 2d 569 (1968), the Court 
 [**62] stated that ""if [the defendants] had no rational motive to conspire, and if [their] conduct is consistent with other, equally 
plausible explanations, the conduct does not give rise to an inference of conspiracy."" Id. at 596-97."
1216,29," Albrecht emphasized that Section 1 ""covers combinations in addition to contracts and conspiracies."" 390 U.S. at 149. But 
again, neither there nor anywhere else has the Court defined ""contract"" as a different concept. As the lower courts have 
consistently held, this statutory concept of contract, combination, or conspiracy is a unity rather than a trinity. "
1217,30," HN22[
] Both Supreme Court and Eleventh Circuit case law require a plaintiff relying upon the consequential affects of a 
contract that does not restrain trade by its  [**64] own terms to show that the contracting parties ""shared a common objective to 
restrain trade"" in order to establish a Section 1 violation. Monsanto, 465 U.S. at 764 (Section 1 claim requires proof of a 
""conscious commitment to a common scheme designed to achieve an unlawful objective""), quoting Edward J. Sweeney & Sons, 
Inc. v. Texaco, Inc., 637 F.2d 105, 111 (3d Cir. 1980); Seagood Trading, 924 F.2d at 1573-74 (in order to establish an 
agreement to restrain trade, plaintiff must show a meeting of the minds to accomplish anticompetitive objective); U.S. Anchor, 7 
F.3d at 1002 (no evidence that defendants shared a mutual objective to restrain trade in the relevant market). Indeed, in both 
Seagood and U.S. Anchor, there was evidence of a competitively neutral written agreement between the allegedly conspiring 
defendants, but that did not dispense with the requirement that the antitrust plaintiff establish a shared ""common objective"" to 
restrain trade in the relevant market. (See Doc. #249 at 7-8)."
1217,31," GSRG cites U.S. Anchor Mfg. for the proposition that evidence of the contract between Nucor and Casey/Park eliminates the 
need to show a common objective to restrain trade. As will be explained below, that argument is far wide of the mark. "
1218,32," Inexplicably, GSRG has questioned the Special Master's ""factual finding"" that ""[t]here is also evidence within the record that 
there existed at least some opportunity to resell the assets in the international market for a profit."" (Doc #190 at 18-19; see also 
id. at 10). The Special Master simply made a Rule 56 finding based upon undisputed facts. GSRG acknowledges, as it must, 
that this ""finding"" is supported by the ""fact that (ultimately) Casey did in fact sell the assets for a profit."" Id. at 19. See also Doc. 
#120 at ¶ 82) (assets were resold to customers in Asia for approximately three times the purchase price). GSRG's suggestion 
 [**70] that there supposedly are ""contrary facts in the record"" about the state of the Asian used equipment market in 2001 and 
2002 not only is incorrect but also irrelevant. The key question is whether Casey recognized an opportunity to resell the Gulf 
States Steel assets in an overseas market, and the evidence is undisputed that Casey did. (See Doc. #120 at ¶¶ 36-37, 39-41). 
Moreover, given that there was a three-year window of time for resale of the assets under the Casey/Nucor agreement, the fact 
that the assets were resold at a substantial profit in about half that time (Doc. #120 at ¶¶ 81-82) certainly suggests that Casey's 
market perception was spot on. "
1219,33," Certainly,  [**72] there is no evidence that Casey/Park's stated legitimate reasons for entering into the agreement were either 
fabricated or contrived. See Boczar v. Manatee Hosps. & Health Sys., Inc., 993 F.2d 1514, 1518-19 (11th Cir. 1993) (finding 
sufficient evidence to support conspiracy claim when defendant's supposed legitimate reasons for acting were shown to be 
fabricated and contrived)."
1219,34," Evidence that is ""speculative or ambiguous"" does not require a trial. Matsushita 475 U.S. at 595."
1219,35," As the Special Maser noted, ""GSRG has pled only one 'contract and combination' in restraint of trade. In order to protect 
 [**74] and extend its near-monopoly dominance in the relevant market, Nucor contracted and combined with Casey to cause 
the creation of Gadsden Industrial Park, LLC [. . .] [Doc. #115 at ¶ 35]. Nucor contracted and combined with Casey Equipment 
Corporation and Gadsden Industrial Park, LLC to purchase the Gulf States Steel Plant with the common intention and objective 
of blocking a perceived competitive threat to Nucor. [Doc. #115 at ¶ 40]."" (Doc. #249 at 3). There is no mention of any additional 
conspirator in GSRG's pleadings, nor is there any reference to other contracts or combinations."
1219,36," Similarly, the court fully agrees with the Special Master's recommendation that, to the extent GSRG has attempted to assert a 
claim under Section 7 (or quasi-Section 7 claim), that assertion is untimely. As an initial matter, the court notes that in its 
objections to the Special Master's Third Report (Doc. #251), GSRG plainly states it is not asserting that Nucor is liable under that 
section. (Id. at 11). Nevertheless, for completeness of the analysis, the court will address the arguments. The Amended 
Complaint contained no such allegation even though GSRG was told in no uncertain terms that any claim  [**75] under Section 7 
of the Clayton Act must be expressly asserted in the Amended Complaint: Unless a claim under Section 7 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 18, is expressly asserted in Plaintiff's amended complaint, 
discovery on matters unique to Section 7 shall not be permitted. This shall not preclude discovery on matters common to 
Section 7 and Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. (Doc. #109 at ¶ 3). To be clear, this language was inserted into the court's August 14, 2007 Case Management Order because, 
in its decision remanding this case, the Eleventh Circuit panel (somewhat curiously) opined that Plaintiff's claims under Sections 
1 and 2 of the Sherman Act ""implicated"" Section 7, Gulf States Reorganization Group, 466 F.3d at 966-67, despite the fact that 
no such claim was asserted in the pleadings. As with the multiple actors theory, any Section 7 claim is too late. "
1220,37," See also Response of Casey Equipment Corporation and Gadsden Industrial Park, LLC, to Plaintiff's Objections to Report and 
Recommendation of Special Master (Doc. #191 at 24-25) (noting that none of GSRG's objections to the First Report challenged 
the Special Master's original recommendation that GSRG's conspiracy-to-monopolize claim under Sherman Act § 2 in Count III 
must be dismissed). "
1221,38," HN27[
] Specific intent to monopolize is a necessary element of a Section 2 offense of actual monopolization. Von Kalinowski at § 9.01(1). Monopoly power is a critical element of a Section 2 offense of actual monopolization, Id. at § 8.02(1) "
1222,39," See also T. Harris Young, 931 F.2d at 823; Austin v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield, 903 F.2d 1385, 1391 (11th Cir. 1990). 
""Monopoly power under [Section] 2 requires, of course, something greater than market power  [**83] under § 1."" Eastman Kodak 
Co. v. Image Technical Services, Inc., 504 U.S. 451, 480, 112 S. Ct. 2072, 119 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1992)."
1222,40," In United States v. E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., the Supreme Court stated the classic test for determining the relevant 
market: HN30[
] ""In considering what is the relevant market for determining the control of price and competition, no more 
definite rule can be declared than that commodities reasonably interchangeable by consumers for the same purposes make up 
that 'part of the trade or commerce,' monopolization of which may be illegal."" 351 U.S. at 395. Factors such as functional 
interchangeability, responsiveness of the sales of one product to the price changes of the other, and degree of competition from 
the potential substitute are all relevant to the market inquiry. See, e.g., Yoder Bros., Inc. v. California-Florida Plant Corp., 537 
F.2d 1347 (5th Cir. 1976). "
1225,41," Proof of these same elements - relevant product market and geographic market - is also required with respect to a Section 1 
rule of reason claim such as that asserted by GSRG in Count I of the First Amended Complaint. E.g., Levine v. Central Florida 
Medical Affiliates, Inc., 72 F.3d 1538, 1551 (11th Cir. 1996) (in Sherman Section 1 case,  [**94] in order to prove that the alleged 
conspiracy or agreement had a ""potential for genuine adverse effects on competition,"" the plaintiff must define the relevant 
market and establish that defendants possessed power in that market). Thus, while the Special Master previously recommended 
summary judgment dismissing GSRG's Section 1 claims based on GSRG's failure to provide significant probative evidence of a 
conspiracy/agreement to restrain trade, (Docs. #188, 207, 249; accord American Key Corp., 762 F.2d at 1579 n.8 (""significant 
probative evidence of a conspiracy is an essential element of all Section 1 violations and of a conspiracy to monopolize in 
violation of Section 2 "")), GSRG's failure to establish either relevant product market or relevant geographic market is a separate 
and independent alternative ground for dismissing its Section 1 claims. E.g., Levine, 72 F.3d at 1553; Gulfstream Park Racing 
Ass'n, 479 F.3d at 1313 (affirming summary judgment dismissing § 1 claim because expert testimony regarding relevant market 
was legally insufficient). That is because the relevant market is also an element of a Sherman Act Section 1 claim. See Kentucky 
Speedway, LLC v. National Ass'n of Stock Car Auto Racing, 588 F.3d 908, 919 (6th Cir. 2009)  [**95] (quoting Worldwide 
Basketball & Sport Tours, Inc. v. NCAA, 388 F.3d 955, 962 (6th Cir. 2005) (listing the requisite elements for a claim under 
Section 1 of the Sherman Act, the second being unreasonable restraint of trade ""in the relevant market "")). "
1226,42," For this reason the Special Master correctly determined that even if Dr. Crandall's assertions  [**99] regarding product market 
were to be considered, given the overwhelming and undisputed record evidence to the contrary, no reasonable trier of fact could 
find that the relevant product market in this case is limited solely to black HRC. (Doc. #305 at 44-45)."
1226,43," As the Special Master found based upon the undisputed evidence, ""producers of 'pickled and oiled' hot rolled coil need only 
refrain from running black hot rolled coil through the additional process to change production in response to a price increase for 
black hot rolled coil."" (Doc. #305 at 44)."
1226,44," In one of its objections, GSRG asserts that the Special Master ""compounds his error"" by applying the Elzinga-Hogarty 
 [**102] LIFO test rather than utilizing an applicable analysis. (Doc. #312 at 8). However, the Special Master referenced the 
Elzinga-Hogarty test, but only to illustrate a point. (Doc. #305 at 37). The Special Master applied and conducted his analysis 
under applicable Eleventh Circuit precedent pronounced in T. Harris Young, 931 F.2d at 823. (Doc. #305 at 33-36). GSRG is in 
error on one other point (albeit a moot one here). Courts, including the one cited by GSRG, have utilized the Elzinga-Hogarty as 
part of an appropriate analysis. See, e.g., California v. Sutter Health System, 130 F. Supp. 2d 1109, 1120-21 (N.D. Cal. 2001); 
see also U.S. v. Oracle Corp., 331 F. Supp. 2d 1098, 1161 (N.D. Cal. 2004). "

1236,6," Plaintiff does not dispute that, absent relation back, her Supplier of Choice claims are barred by the statute of limitations. In the 
SAC, Plaintiff states that, on or about July 12, 2000, the De Beers group launched the Supplier of Choice program, which altered 
the way in which its Sightholders were selected.  [*26] (SAC ¶ 95.) On June 3, 2003, W.B. David was notified that it failed to 
qualify as a Sightholder under the Supplier of Choice program. (Id. ¶ 109). After a six-month transition period (i.e., after 
December 2003), W.B. David ceased being a Sightholder, and was no longer able to able to purchase rough diamonds from 
Defendant. (Id.) At that point, W.B. David's termination was final; Plaintiff does not allege any attempt by W.B. David to regain its 
Sightholder status. Thus, based on a straightforward application of the statute of limitations, Plaintiff should have brought claims 
related to the Supplier of Choice program within four years after W.B. David learned that it would no longer be a Sightholder, i.e., 
by June 2007, and certainly no later than four years after its actual termination as a Sightholder, i.e., by December 2007. The

1237,," because the original complaint contained those same facts. That result is clearly not envisaged by the Federal Rules of Civil 
Procedure."
1237,8," Vogel is distinguishable from the instant facts, because, in Vogel, the plaintiff expressed intent to withdraw certain claims in an 
opposition to a motion to dismiss, rather than amend her complaint. Nevertheless, the Vogel decision makes clear that when a 
plaintiff makes an affirmative decision to no longer pursue certain claims,  [*28] that decision is akin to a voluntary dismissal of 
those claims."
1237,9," It is true that courts have found that a second amended complaint can relate back to an original complaint. See Prescott v. 
Annetts, No. 09 Civ. 4435, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 75025, 2010 WL 3020023, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. July 22, 2010) (McMahon, J.) 
(finding that the Section 1983 claims in plaintiff's first and second amended complaints are not time-barred because they relate 
back to the original complaint); DeLong v. Soufiane, No. 05 cv. 5529, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2944, 2010 WL 234781, at *3 
(E.D.N.Y. Jan. 14, 2010) (""[T]he Court finds that all but two causes of action alleged in the Second Amended Complaint are 
timely because they relate back to the filing of the original Complaint.""). However, in those decisions, there was no suggestion 
that the plaintiff had abandoned any set of claims in an intervening complaint, or that the plaintiff's original complaint contained a 
different operative set of facts than the subsequent amended complaints. "
1238,10, See supra note 4.
1238,11," As noted above, the parties agree that the Sullivan release covers all of Plaintiff's claims against Defendant except any claims 
arising out of W.B. David's status as a Sightholder. See Tese-Milner I, 613 F. Supp. 2d at 409."
1238,12," Defendant also argues that Plaintiff's Supplier of Choice claims must be dismissed because Plaintiff has (1) failed to allege 
monopoly power in a relevant market; and (2) failed to allege the willful acquisition or maintenance of monopoly power, both of 
which are prerequisites for a Section 2 Sherman Act claim. The Court need not address those agreements because it has 
dismissed Plaintiff's Supplier of Choice claims under Section 2 of the Sherman Act for other reasons."
1238,13," The De Beers Group used the U.S. Carat Club as a way to meet with U.S. Sightholders, as well as other large U.S. 
manufacturers and retailers. (SAC ¶ 69.) The De Beers Group launched the Millennium Campaign to sell limited edition 
diamonds inscribed with the De Beers name. (SAC ¶ 80.)"
1238,14," Plaintiff  [*35] appears to acknowledge that her advertising and marketing claims must relate back to an earlier complaint in 
order for them to be timely. Plaintiff filed her SAC on April 13, 2010. Four years prior to that date, Plaintiff was admittedly no 
longer a Sightholder, and so any claims accruing after that date would be barred by the Sullivan Release. Any claims accruing 
before that date would have had to have been brought earlier than April 13, 2010. "
1239,15," See OC ¶¶ 165-70, 189, 318, & 331."
1239,16," Plaintiff does not cite specific dates with respect to her advertising and marketing claims. (See SAC ¶¶ 68-79; 92-94.) In the 
event that the Sullivan settlement is vacated, Plaintiff is granted leave to replead any claims surrounding Defendant's advertising 
and marketing activity that are timely as measured from the SAC (accounting for the fact that the Court has found that Plaintiff's 
advertising and marketing claims in the SAC do not relate back to the OC)."
1239,17," Defendant also argues that Plaintiff's advertising and marketing claims must be dismissed because Plaintiff has (1) failed to 
allege monopoly power in a relevant market and (2) failed to allege the willful acquisition or maintenance of monopoly power, 
both of which are prerequisites  [*37] for a Section 2 Sherman Act claim. The Court need not address those arguments because 
it has dismissed Plaintiff's advertising and marketing claims under Section 2 of the Sherman Act for other reasons. "

Control"")."
1240,19," In the event that the Sullivan settlement is vacated, Plaintiff is granted leave to replead  [*41] any claims surrounding 
Defendant's 2005 agreement with the Government of Botswana. "
1241,20," Defendant also argues that Plaintiff's Section 1 Sherman Act claims related to the  [*42] ALROSA and Botswana agreements 
are barred by the Act of State doctrine, which ""precludes the courts in this country from inquiring into the validity of the public 
acts a recognized foreign sovereign power committed within its own territory."" Banco Nacional de Cuba v. Sabbatino, 376 U.S.

449, 453-54 (2d Cir. 1987) (affirming dismissal of antitrust claims on Act of State grounds). Defendant further argues that 
Plaintiff's Sherman Act Section 1 claims must be dismissed because Plaintiff has failed to allege a plausible relevant market and 
has failed to show how Defendant restrained competition. The Court need not address Defendant's Act of State argument, or 
any of its additional arguments, because it has dismissed Plaintiff's Sherman Act Section 1 claims for other reasons."
1241,21," The Court noted however, ""that Plaintiff [could] assert against Diamdel N.V. only claims that accrued on or after the date on 
which the Amended Complaint  [*45] was filed."" Tese-Milner II, at 5 n.1. "
1251,1, The fee was later raised to $300 per semester.
1251,2," The dining-dollars program at UA was eventually modified to allow students to spend their dining dollars at approximately four 
off-campus dining establishments."
1251,3," It appears that Auburn, unlike UA and UAB, may not officially use the term ""dining dollars"" in association with its mandatory 
dining fee; however, for convenience, and because of the similarities between the dining programs administered by the 
universities, that term is used in this opinion to refer to Auburn's dining program as well."
1251,4, Students enrolled in classes prior to the fall 2008 semester are exempt from paying the mandatory dining fee. 
1252,5," The universities are controlled by two boards of trustees. The board of trustees for the University of Alabama system controls 
both UA and UAB; Auburn has a separate board of trustees. The university administrators named as defendants by the 
students, all sued solely in their official capacities, were: (1) C. Ray Hayes, vice chancellor for financial affairs for the University 
of Alabama system; (2) Sarah B. Newton, then president pro tempore of the Auburn board of trustees; and (3) Dr. Donald L. 
Large, executive vice president and chief financial officer at Auburn."
1252,6," The students sought money damages only from the food-services vendors, presumably because this Court has held that HN1[ ] ""to the extent that [an] action seeks money damages from the State, it is barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity.""

1253,7," However, although the students may seek injunctive and declaratory relief against the university administrators, § 14 still 
immunizes those State officials from any claim for money damages. Harbert, 990 So. 2d at 839-41. "
1256,8," The order entered in the case dismissing the complaint challenging Auburn's dining-dollars program was virtually identical; 
however, the paragraph describing the legal basis for Auburn's operations read as follows: ""Applying such law here, the court begins with the legal basis for Auburn's operations. Section 266 of the Alabama 
constitution declares that 'Auburn University shall be under the management and control of a board of trustees.' [Section 
16-48-2, Ala. Code 1975,] provides that the Auburn board of trustees 'shall have all the rights, privileges and franchises 
necessary to a promotion of the end of its creation and shall be charged with all corresponding duties, liabilities and 
responsibilities.' Further, from [§ 16-48-4, Ala. Code 1975,] comes the additional power 'to organize the institute by 
appointing a corps of instructors, who shall be styled the faculty of the university and such other instructors and officers as 
the interest of the university may require; and to remove any such instructors or other officers, and to fix their salaries or 
compensation, and increase or reduce the same at  [**25] its discretion, to regulate, alter, or modify the government of the 
university, as it may deem advisable; to prescribe courses of instruction, rates of tuition and fees; to confer such academic 
and honorary degrees as are usually conferred by institutions of similar character; and to do whatever else it may deem 
best for promoting the interest of the university.' (Emphasis added.)"" "
1257,9," We also note that the CFG report submitted to UA in 1995 indicates that ""mandatory board plans"" were required at earlier 
periods in UA's history and that on-campus dining services had been contractor-operated since 1965."
1257,10," The students object to the trial court's use of HN17[
] § 41-16-27(g), Ala. Code 1975 -- which exempts certain 
 [**27] contracts, including those for food services, negotiated on behalf of universities from the State's mandatory-bid 
requirements -- to bolster its finding of foreseeability because that statute was not enacted until 2000, 6 years after the 
implementation of the first dining-dollars program at UA and around 100 years after the enactment of the first incarnation of § 6-
5-60. However, § 41-16-27(g) does not grant universities the authority to execute contracts for food services; rather, by 
exempting those specific contracts from the mandatory-bid process, it implicitly recognizes that that authority exists."
1257,11," We also note that this Court overruled McRae's in Ex parte McRae's of Alabama, Inc., 703 So. 2d 351, 352 (Ala. 1997), 
effectively agreeing with the trial court's determination that the criminal acts of the third party were not foreseeable as a matter of 
law, stating: ""[s]uffice it to say that there had never been a similar assault on the defendant's store premises, or any violent 
crimes of any nature on those premises."" "

897, 74 L. Ed. 2d 723 (1983), the Supreme Court identified HN7[
] several factors relevant to whether a plaintiff has standing 
to bring a federal antitrust claim including: (1) the nature of the plaintiffs alleged injury; that is, whether it was the type the 
antitrust laws were intended to forestall, (2) the directness of the injury, (3) the speculative measure of the harm, (4) the risk of 
duplicative recovery, and (5) the complexity in apportioning damages. Transitions focuses its argument in the motion to dismiss 
on the nature of the alleged injury suffered by Vision-Ease. "
1344,7," Transitions' reliance on NicSand, Inc. and similar case law is  [*21] misplaced given the allegations in the Complaint. For 
example, the Complaint does not indicate that the wholesalers or retailers of photochromic lenses mandated price discounts and 
exclusivity nor does this case involve a competitor seeking to recoup lost market share in a market it used to dominate. Id. at 
454 (""NicSand has not sued 3M because it wants to share shelf space with its competitor; it sued 3M because it wants that shelf 
space all to itself..."")."
1344,8," The Complaint alleges the existence of exclusionary agreements, tying arrangements, and bundled discounts. See Complaint, 
¶¶ 4, 36-37."
1344,9," Vision-Ease did not respond to Transitions' argument that a tying claim requires products from two different markets. In 
addition, contrary to Vision-Ease's representation in its opposition memorandum, the Complaint does not include an allegation 
that Transitions agreed to stop requiring customers to accept exclusive agreements conditioned on them purchasing the entire 
line of photochromic products."
1344,10," For example, these allegations may be relevant to Vision-Ease's monopolization claim under § 2 of the Sherman Act (Count I). 
See, e.g., LePage's Inc. v. 3M, 324 F.3d 141, 157 (3d Cir. 2003)  [*23] (en banc) (holding that bundled rebates and exclusivity 
arrangements that may not, standing alone, give rise to claims under § 1 of the Sherman Act and § 3 of the Clayton Act, but may 
nonetheless be relevant to claims under § 2 of the Sherman Act); see also United States v. Dentsply Int'l, Inc., 399 F.3d 181, 
197 (3d Cir. 2005) (holding that finding of no liability under stricter standards of § 3 of the Clayton Act did not preclude 
application of evidence of exclusive dealing to support claim under § 2 of the Sherman Act)."
1344,11," Because the Complaint contains sufficient factual allegations to state antitrust claims regardless of the alleged ""bundled 
discounts,"" the Court need not address under what circumstances a bundled discount or rebate standing alone would constitute 
an antitrust violation. Compare LePage's Inc. v. 3M, 324 F.3d 141, 157 (3d Cir. 2003) (en banc) (manufacturer's exclusionary 
conduct by bundling rebates could violate the Sherman Act's monopolization provisions) with Cascade Health Solutions v. 
PeaceHealth, 515 F.3d 883, 903 (9th Cir. 2008) (exclusionary conduct element of monopolization or attempted monopolization 
claim arising under the Sherman Act could not be satisfied  [*24] by reference to bundled discounts unless they resulted in 
prices that were below appropriate measure of defendant's costs). "

1354,5," Although it is theoretically an open question as to whether Rule 9(b) pleading standards are applicable in this situation, it 
appears that Apple should plead with particularity the allegations regarding the false FRAND declarations. First, the theory upon 
which the claim is based, is one that sounds in fraud, and Rule 9(b) itself requires a heightened pleading standard in these 
situations. Second, other fraud claims in the patent  [*15] context, such as claims for inequitable conduct, must also be pled with 
particularity. See, e.g. Cent. Admixture Pharmacy Servs., Inc. v. Advanced Cardiac Solutions, 482 F.3d 1347, 1356 (Fed. Cir. 
2007); see also In re Netflix Litig., 506 F. Supp. 2d 308, 315 (N.D. Cal. 2007) (applying Rule 9(b) to a fraud-based claim in 
another antitrust context). Moreover, Apple does not appear to contest that 9(b) is the proper standard to apply here."
1354,6," The requirement that Apple plead with particularity which patents FRAND declarations were made and when is important here 
because Apple also alleges that Samsung has declared essential many patents that are not, in fact, essential to practicing the 
UMTS standard. Counterclaims in Reply ¶ 58. If, as Apple alleges, some Samsung patents are not essential to the standard, it 
will likely be difficult for Apple to establish that Samsung's conduct has antitrust implications. If the patents at issue are non- "

throughout the states,"" and ""Defendants' illegal conduct had a substantial effect on commerce in the above states"" (Indirect CAC 
¶¶ 72, 73) are conclusory and fail to specifically tie their injuries to the alleged MgO conspiracy occurring or its effects in those 
states. IP Plaintiffs lack statutory standing to sue under HN29[
] Utah's antitrust laws because they have a citizenship/residency 
requirement. See U.C.A. §§ 1953 76-10-919 (""A person who is a citizen of this state or a resident of this state and who is injured 
or is threatened with injury in his business or property by a violation of the Utah Antitrust Act may bring an action for injunctive

municipalities, townships and any political subdivision organized under the authority of this State, and the United States, are 
considered a person having standing to bring an action under this subsection.""). However, IP Plaintiffs apparently have standing to sue under HN31[
] Mississippi, New Hampshire,  [*31] Vermont, and 
Wisconsin antitrust laws, as they provide a private right of action and have no discernible requirement of in-state conduct or 
effect, or residency. See Miss. Code Ann. §§ 75-21-1, 9 (Mississippi); HN32[
] N.H. Rev. Stat § 356:1 (New Hampshire); HN33[

] W.S.A. §§ 133.03, 133.18 (Wisconsin). "
1392,11," Moreover, the CACs specifically note at the outset that the term MgO can refer to DBM or CCM. See (Direct CAC ¶ 1; Indirect 
CAC ¶ 1 n.1). "
1394,12," This also disposes of Sumitomo's contention that the Court should consider ""certain relevant facts"" noted in Animal Science 
Prods., Inc. v. China Nat'l Metals & Minerals, 596 F. Supp. 2d 842 (D.N.J. 2008) regarding the domestic DBM and CCM markets. 
(Sumitomo (DP Pl.'s) Br., 4.) "
1395,13," This is to be distinguished  [*49] from the requirement to plead plus factors to rule out independent action ""when a plaintiffs' 
claims of conspiracy rest on parallel conduct,"" In re Ins. Brokerage, 618 F.3d at 323, which is discussed below regarding the 
alleged CCM Agreement. Plaintiffs need not assert plus factors to establish the plausibility of the DBM Agreement because they 
set forth direct allegations of that agreement. See In re Ins. Brokerage, 618 F.3d at 323 (""Allegations of direct evidence of an 
agreement, if sufficiently detailed, are independently adequate."")."
1395,14," Moreover, there is nothing ""inherently implausible"" about Sumitomo's attempt to assuage the Vannorsdels' concern about 
Premier's potential retaliation by stating that it speaks with Premier on a daily basis to set DBM prices and allocate shares of the 
DBM market. It is certainly plausible that Sumitomo was aware of the risk of retaliation by Premier but believed it could ""enter the 
[CCM] market discreetly"" (Direct CAC ¶ 39; Indirect CAC ¶ 48) because Premier's attention was focused on maintaining their 
agreement in the DBM market. "
1397,15," In any event, Plaintiffs allege Sumitomo's motive for entering the CCM market (filling excess barge capacity), and certain steps 
taken to enter that market (meeting with the Vannorsdels in Tulsa)."
1397,16," Citing to Toledo Mack Sales & Serv. v. Mack Trucks, Inc., 530 F.3d 204 (3d Cir. 2008), YAS further argues that Plaintiffs' 
failure to establish that YAS occupies the same level as Sumitomo and Premier on the MgO supply chain ""precludes per se 
treatment of YAS' alleged antitrust violations."" (YAS Br., 4 n. 5.) This argument misses the mark. While Toledo Mack noted that, 
""[i]n contrast to horizontal price-fixing agreements between entities at the same level of a product's distribution chain, the legality 
of a vertical agreement that imposes a restriction on the dealer's ability to sell the manufacturer's product is governed  [*59] by 
the rule of reason,"" and that ""[t]he rule of reason analysis applies even when . . . the plaintiff alleges that the purpose of the 
vertical agreement between a manufacturer and its dealers is to support illegal horizontal agreements between multiple dealers,"" 
530 F.3d at 225 (citation omitted), Plaintiffs do not allege YAS' arrangement with Sumitomo to source Chinese magnesite and 
MgO constitutes an unlawful vertical agreement to support a horizontal conspiracy between Sumitomo and Premier. Rather, 
Plaintiffs allege that YAS participated directly with Sumitomo and Premier in the alleged horizontal conspiracy to fix prices in and 
allocate shares of the DBM market and allocate the CCM market to Premier. Moreover, ""[t]he law is settled that HN47[
] where 
an upstream supplier participates in a conspiracy involving horizontal competitors, it is proper to analyze the entire restraint as 
one of horizontal price-fixing."" In re Mercedez-Benz, 157 F. Supp. 2d at 362. "
1398,17," Citing to Howard Hess Dental Laboratories Inc. v. Dentsply Intern, Inc., 424 F.3d 363 (3d Cir. 2005), YAS also argues that 
Plaintiffs' failure to allege that it sold DBM or CCM requires its dismissal from this case as a matter of law. While that case notes 
HN49[
] the well-settled proposition that only direct purchasers may recover damages in federal antitrust suits, it by no means "
1399,," indicates that only a seller of the product in question may be found liable in a Section 1 conspiracy. As previously discussed, 
YAS need not have participated in a particular act in furtherance of the conspiracy to be held liable. "
1400,18," IP Plaintiffs' state antitrust law claims similarly require dismissal for failure to establish fraudulent concealment, as their 
HN53[

] Wis. Stat. § 133.18(2) (2011) (Wisconsin) (six years). However, to the extent that IP Plaintiffs sufficiently amend their allegations to establish fraudulent concealment of their federal antitrust claims, they will also have established 
fraudulent concealment of their state law antitrust claims.  [*73] See Note 9. "
1401,19," Defendants further argue that Sumitomo's alleged admission to the Vannorsdels of the DBM Agreement cuts against their 
fraudulent concealment allegations. This is unpersuasive because the admission in no way put Plaintiffs on notice of their claims 
during the limitations period. See Emerson Elec. Co. v. Le Carbone Lorraine, SA, 500 F. Supp. 2d 437, 448 (D.N.J. 2007) 
(HN78[
] ""Where fraudulent concealment of a federal antitrust claim has been shown, the four-year federal statute of limitations 
begins anew from the time the plaintiff knew or should have known of the existence of the federal claim."" (quotations and 
citations omitted)). "
1402,20," Nor can Plaintiffs' conclusory allegation that ""defendants met secretly and among themselves for the express purpose of fixing 
prices and allocating markets  [*80] of domestically sold MgO"" (Direct CAC ¶ 50; Indirect CAC ¶ 57) satisfy the affirmative act 
requirement. "
1403,21," While the following inquiry notice analysis is laid out in the context of a RICO case, it has also been applied in antitrust cases 
involving price-fixing. See In re Aspartame Antitrust Litig., 416 Fed. App'x. 208, 211-12 (3d Cir. 2011); In re Electrical Carbon 
Prods. Antitrust Litig., 333 F. Supp. 2d 303, 317 (D.N.J. 2004). "
1405,22," Thus, contrary to Defendants' contention, the fact that IP Plaintiffs fail to allege that they reside or purchased an MgO product 
in a given state does not automatically deprive them of standing to sue under the state's consumer protection or unfair 
competition law. To be sure, the case Defendants cite in support of this contention held that the named plaintiffs in that case 
lacked standing to assert consumer protection and unfair competition claims under the laws of states in which they neither 
resided nor suffered an injury. See In re Potash 667 F. Supp. 2d at 924. However, the Court cannot accept this holding as a 
bright line rule. Standing issues are intimately bound up with the elements of the particular claim asserted, as a plaintiff must 
establish that his injury is ""fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant."" Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560; see also Blum, 457 
U.S. at 999 (""The  [*91] complaining party must also show that he is within the class of persons who will be concretely 
affected.""); Allen, 468 U.S. at 752 (""[T]he standing inquiry requires careful judicial examination of a complaint's allegations to 
ascertain whether the particular plaintiff is entitled to an adjudication of the particular claims asserted.""). "

1448,16," We decline to adopt the approach embraced by Judge Brobson in his dissenting opinion. While he posits that many public 
agency activities may satisfy the ""trade or commerce"" requirement of the CPL, he does not address the ""transaction-purpose"" 
requirement for actions under Section 9.2. Also, he does not address the most fundamental limitation on liability: that trade or 
commerce conduct must be ""unfair or deceptive."" See Section 3 of the CPL, 73 P.S. §201-3. We see nothing in the language or

1456,11," In Weinberg v. Sun Company, Inc., 565 Pa. 612, 777 A.2d 442 (2001), our Supreme Court recognized that there is a 
distinction between Commonwealth actions and private actions brought under the CPL. In Weinberg, purchasers of gasoline 
filed a consumer class action under the CPL, the consumer fraud laws of all other states, and common law, challenging the 
corporation's advertising of the gasoline and alleging that the corporation's advertisements induced consumers to purchase the 
gas when their vehicles did not need the high level of octane the gas contained. The trial court denied class certification 
 [**50] on the basis that requirements of numerosity and common questions were not met and individual questions of fact 
predominated. The Superior Court reversed as to two of the four CPL claims. On further appeal, the issue before the Supreme 
Court involved the interpretation of section 9.2 of the CPL, permitting a private right of action. The court reviewed section 4 of the 
CPL, applicable to the attorney general, and section 9.2, governing a private action, and concluded that ""Commonwealth actions 
and private actions are readily distinguishable."" Id., 565 Pa. at 617, 777 A.2d at 445."
1456,12," Thus, unlike the dissenting view expressed by Judge Leavitt, I would not address the question of whether the Commonwealth 
of Pennsylvania, its agencies, political subdivisions or any other governmental entity engages in ""trade"" or ""commerce"" that is 
regulated by the CPL. However, were this issue raised by either party on appeal, I believe that a statement to the effect that no 
such entity is engaged in trade or commerce, (Dissent, pages 1, 5), is factually and legally incorrect. (See the Pennsylvania 
Liquor Control Board's website directing users to its ""retail page."") Also, I am not persuaded that a breach of contract claim 
against the College is actionable under 42 U.S.C. §1983. In addition, I do not believe that it is necessary to revisit our decision in Commonwealth v. TAP Pharmaceutical Products, Inc., 
885 A.2d 1127, 1143-44, (Pa. Cmwlth. 2005), and consider again whether the Commonwealth has parens patriae standing to 
pursue damage claims of individuals under the CPL, where the issue in the present case is whether an action may be brought 
under the CPL against the College. Finally, in answer to the query whether  [**52] accountability under the CPL is needed, (Dissent, page 15), I believe that the 
egregious conduct alleged here, see footnote 4, infra, suggests that such accountability is not redundant. Moreover, in light of the specificity with which the phrase ""unfair or deceptive acts or practices"" is defined by section 2(4)(i)-(xxi) 
of the CPL, 73 P.S. §201-2(4)(i)-xxi), and particularly in light of the nature of the conduct described, e.g., passing off goods or 
services as those of another, I do not share the concerns expressed in Judge Brobson's dissent and do not expect that actions "
1457,," will regularly be brought against state or local agencies for the egregious conduct the CPL prohibits. More important, I would not 
characterize such acts by public entities as causing ""purely private injury."""

1499,1," The Cipro III court referred to the MDL plaintiffs' fraud-on-the-PTO claim as a “Walker Process type” state law claim. The court

S. Ct. 347], the Supreme Court held that the enforcement of a patent procured by fraud on the patent office may be a violation of 
the Sherman Act provided that the other  [***12] elements necessary to a Sherman Act claim are present. [Citation.] Here, 
however, the plaintiffs alleged a violation of state antitrust laws.” (Cipro III, supra, 544 F.3d at pp. 1329–1330, fn. 6.) "
1500,2," The Arkansas Carpenters court explained that the terms “reverse exclusionary payment” and “pay-for-delay” refer to a 
settlement in which “the patent holder (Bayer) agree[s] to pay the alleged infringer to settle the lawsuit, and in exchange, the 
alleged infringer agree[s] not to enter the market.” (Arkansas Carpenters, supra, 604 F.3d at p. 102.)  [***17] The Tamoxifen 
court referred to such payments as “reverse payments.” (Tamoxifen, supra, 466 F.3d at p. 205.)"
1500,3," The modification was to exclude all Cipro purchasers who paid a flat copayment and would have paid the same copayment for 
generic ciprofloxacin under the terms of their health coverage. (In re Cipro Cases I & II, supra, 121 Cal.App.4th at p. 419.) "

1501,5," Section 16720, subdivision (a) specifies as a trust purpose a combination “[t]o create or carry out restrictions in trade or 
commerce.” Subdivisions (b) through (e) of section 16720 specify various anticompetitive schemes and agreements constituting 
trusts, and section 16726 states that, except as otherwise specified in the Cartwright Act, “every trust is unlawful, against public 
policy and void.” "
1506,6," The Tamoxifen court explained that “reverse payments are particularly to be expected in the drug-patent context because the 
Hatch-Waxman Act created an environment that encourages them.” (Tamoxifen, supra, 466 F.3d at p. 206.) The court noted that 
“under the Hatch-Waxman Act, the patent holder ordinarily brings suit shortly after the paragraph IV ANDA has been filed—
before the filer has spent substantial sums  [***42] on the manufacturing, marketing, or distribution of the potentially infringing 
generic drug. The prospective generic manufacturer therefore has relatively little to lose in litigation precipitated by a paragraph 
IV certification beyond litigation costs and the opportunity for future profits from selling the generic drug. … [¶] Accordingly, a 
generic marketer has few disincentives to file an ANDA with a paragraph IV certification. The incentive [to file an ANDA IV], by 
contrast, may be immense: the profits it will likely garner in competing with the patent holder without having invested 
substantially in the development of the drug, and, in addition, possible entitlement to a 180-day period (to be triggered at its 
inclination) during which it would be the exclusive seller of the generic drug in the market.” (Id. at pp. 206–207, fn. omitted.) On 
the other hand, “[t]he patent holder's risk if it loses the resulting patent suit is correspondingly large: It will be stripped of its 
patent monopoly. At the same time, it stands to gain little from winning other than the continued protection of its lawful monopoly 
over the manufacture and sale of the drug in question. [¶] ‘Hatch-Waxman essentially  [***43] redistributes the relative risk 
assessments and explains the flow of settlement funds and their magnitude. Because of the Hatch-Waxman scheme, [the 
generic challengers] gain[] considerable leverage in patent litigation: the exposure to liability amount[s] to litigation costs, but 
pale[s] in comparison to the immense volume of generic sales and profits.’ ” (Id. at p. 207.) "
1508,7," A group of professors filed an amici curiae brief entitled: “Brief Amici Curiae of 78 Intellectual Property Law, Antitrust Law, 
Economics, and Business Professors in Support of Appellant.” "
1509,8," The Cipro III court added: “To the extent that the Sixth Circuit may have found a per se antitrust violation based solely on the 
reverse payments, we respectfully disagree.” (Cipro III, supra, 544 F.3d at p. 1335.)"
1509,9," We acknowledge that amici curiae, the FTC, and the Department of Justice have advocated various approaches under which 
reverse payment settlements of patent infringement litigation under the Hatch-Waxman Act could be deemed to violate antitrust 
law even when they do not restrain competition beyond the exclusionary scope of a patent. However, considering the necessity 
of maintaining a proper balance between the competing policies underlying patent law and antitrust law, we believe that any 
rule prohibiting such settlements of Hatch-Waxman litigation should be made by Congress rather than the courts. "
1510,10," Plaintiffs also suggest that Bayer's infringement suit would not have been successful by alleging that “[b]ut for the Cipro 
Agreements, generic ciprofloxacin would have been on the United States market by January 1997.” "
1511,11," The Cipro II court was addressing Bayer's motion “for summary judgment that Bayer's suits against Barr and the subsequent 
’444 Patent challengers were not sham litigation as a matter of law.” (Cipro II, supra, 363 F.Supp.2d at p. 547.)"
1511,12," The Cipro II court addressed this point, stating: “At oral argument, plaintiffs asserted that the court should give little 
 [***62] weight to these subsequent failed attacks because none of them raised what plaintiffs believe to be the most forceful 
attack on the ’444 Patent—namely, inequitable conduct. Plaintiffs argue that this defense required extensive discovery and 
would take a long period of time to prepare and try, and that this explains why none of the subsequent challengers raised this 
issue. [¶] But this argument is not very convincing in light of the fact that one of the challenges—Carlsbad's, on the ground of 
obviousness—also required extensive discovery and resulted in a nine-day bench trial. It is difficult to accept the notion that 
Carlsbad abandoned a stronger argument because it would have presumably required a greater effort, especially since Barr had 
already done most of the preparatory work on the inequitable conduct issue.” (Cipro II, supra, 363 F.Supp.2d at p. 530.)"
1511,13, Plaintiffs emphasize on appeal that they are not asserting a claim of fraud on the PTO. 
1513,14," Although it is not essential  [***72] to our preemption analysis, we note that the theory of liability alleged in plaintiffs' second 
amended complaint that caused the federal district court to remand this case to state court in In re Ciprofloxacin Hydrochloride 
Antitrust Litigation, supra, 166 F.Supp.2d 740 lacks merit, as the district court later acknowledged. The court remanded the case 
based on its conclusion “that plaintiffs have asserted at least one theory by which they may establish state antitrust violations 
without resorting to a determination of patent law. Plaintiffs' complaints allege there would have been generic competition in the 
market for ciprofloxacin prior to the expiration of Bayer's patent if Bayer had not reached an unreasonably anti-competitive 
agreement with Barr, HMR, and Rugby. … [Plaintiffs] asserted that, as a matter of fact, Bayer would have authorized Barr to 
distribute ciprofloxacin by granting Barr a license, or by other means, had Barr not agreed to drop its challenge to the validity of 
the ’444 patent in exchange for large cash payments.” (Id. at p. 748, citations omitted.) This theory of liability fails because any restraint on competition resulting from Bayer's decision to enter into the Cipro 
agreements  [***73] instead of some other licensing agreement was within the exclusionary zone of the ’444 patent and thus is 
not a basis for imposing antitrust or unfair competition liability on defendants. As the Cipro II court explained: “[P]laintiffs’ 
assertion that Bayer's payment to Barr is anti-competitive because, without it, Bayer and Barr would have agreed on an earlier 
entry date for Barr or would have otherwise fashioned a more pro-competitive agreement must also fail. This assertion ignores 
the fact that, if defendants were within their rights (more specifically, the patent right) in reaching the settlement they did, 
consumers have no right to second-guess whether some different agreement would have been more palatable.” (Cipro II, supra, 
363 F.Supp.2d at p. 536.) Regarding its basis for remanding the case, the district court stated that “[u]pon further reflection, I 
have concluded that patent law imposes no such restriction against cash payments by a patent holder, and, accordingly, 
antitrust law does not impose such a restriction.” (Id. at p. 536, fn. 21.) In other words, Bayer was not restricted by patent or 
antitrust law to settlement options more favorable to competition than the settlement  [***74] it reached. "
1514,15," We do not hold that the issue of whether a patent infringement suit is objectively baseless can never be decided by a state 
court; there may be cases where a suit can be shown to be objectively baseless without the necessity of resolving a substantial 
question of federal patent law. "
1515,16," We note that plaintiffs complain that the court improperly considered evidence concerning the litigation challenging the ’444 
patent that occurred after the Cipro settlement and the reexamination of the patent. We do not find the admission of this 
evidence to be prejudicial, however, because the essential facts of those suits were established as undisputed by plaintiffs’ 
responses to Bayer's separate statement of undisputed facts in support of its motion for summary judgment (Nos. 29–33). "

1548,27," Indeed, the prototypical monopsonist is the factory in the company town. Because the factory is the sole employer—the sole

commercial mobile broadband in the top 10 markets."" (Sprint Compl. ¶ 38.) Cellular South alleges that, when the FCC 
""auctioned much  [**53] of the 700 MHz spectrum"" in early 2008, ""AT&T and Verizon were able to purchase most"" of it, ""winning 
85% (by value) of the paired spectrum."" (Cellular South Compl. ¶ 47.) Sprint and Cellular South do not describe their own 
holdings of beachfront spectrum, nor do they allege how much T-Mobile has (and therefore how much of it AT&T would stand to 
gain if the proposed merger were to be consummated). "
1552,33," Another requirement for connection is that a mobile device and  [**54] a mobile network use the same transmission 
technology. (See Sprint Compl. ¶ 57; Cellular South Compl. ¶ 38.) Transmission technologies are addressed in the Court's 
discussion of the market for roaming. (See Section II(B)(1), infra.)"
1552,34," (Compare Sprint Compl. ¶  [**56] 36 (""AT&T holds a nationwide average of 40 MHz below 1 GHz— almost three times Sprint's 
holdings below 1 GHz, and slightly less than Verizon's average of 54 MHz below 1 GHz."") with Motion to Dismiss Sprint at 7 
(""AT&T's acquisition of T-Mobile is driven by AT&T's need to alleviate a severe shortage of spectrum and network capacity 
constraints. . . . Sprint faces no spectrum constraints today, and it benefits so long as AT&T faces high costs and constraints on 
its ability to innovate."").)"
1552,35," (See Sprint Compl. ¶ 41 (""When multiple carriers build their networks and develop handsets at the same time in a newly 
allocated spectrum band, they all benefit from the shared costs of development."").) "
1553,36," For example, if a subscriber of Carrier A is in a location that is not served by Carrier A but that is served by Carrier B and 
Carrier C, the subscriber will still be able to use her phone if and only if Carrier A has a roaming agreement with Carrier B or 
Carrier C, or both. In this example, Carriers B and C are in a position to sell roaming to Carrier A. "
1554,37," See Weyerhaeuser Co., 549 U.S. at 322 (""'[M]onopoly and monopsony are symmetrical distortions of competition from an 
economic standpoint[.]' . . . The kinship  [**62] between monopoly and monopsony suggests that similar legal standards should 
apply to claims of monopolization and to claims of monopolization."" (first alteration in the original) (quoting Vogel v. Am. Soc. of 
Appraisers, 744 F.2d 598, 601 (7th Cir. 1984)))."
1554,38," In addition to using the same transmission technology, a phone must be tuned to the same spectrum band as a competing 
carriers' network in order to function. (See Sprint Compl. ¶ 57; Section II(A)(3), supra.)"
1554,39," For example, ""AT&T and T-Mobile use GSM-based High Speed Pack Access ('HSPA') technology"" for their 3G mobile 
broadband service, and ""Verizon and Sprint use[] CDMA-based Evolution Data Optimized ('EV-DO')."" (Sprint Compl. ¶ 45.)"
1554,40," For its current 4G network, however, Sprint ""uses WiMax technology."" (Sprint Compl. ¶ 46.) "
1555,41," In court, counsel for AT&T represented that ""even AT&T needs roaming. In fact, we are [a] net buyer of roaming from Cellular 
South."" (10/24/11 Tr. 50-51.) The Court does not consider this representation for its factual value, but rather highlights it as an 
example of the kind of information that the complaints omit. "

1556,43," Verizon Commc'ns Inc. v. Law Offices of Curtis V. Trinko, LLP, 540 U.S. 398, 124 S. Ct. 872, 157 L. Ed. 2d 823 (2004), is not 
to the contrary. In Trinko, the Supreme Court noted that, ""in certain circumstances, 'regulation significantly diminishes the 
 [**72] likelihood of major antitrust harm.'"" 540 U.S. at 412 (quoting Town of Concord v. Boston Edison Co., 915 F.2d 17, 25 (1st 
Cir. 1990)). But when considering a motion to dismiss, ""likelihood"" is not the issue: this Court is concerned with plausibility. 
""Asking for plausible grounds to infer"" a threatened injury-in-fact ""does not impose a probability requirement at the pleading 
stage."" Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556. Furthermore, Trinko did not address antitrust standing, see 540 U.S. at 416 n.5, and instead 
considered whether the plaintiff had stated an antitrust claim on the merits. See id. at 417-18 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (""I would 
not decide the merits of the [antitrust] claim unless and until such a claim is advanced by"" a plaintiff with antitrust standing.)."
1556,44," Backhaul is one form of ""special  [**73] access,"" and is regulated by the FCC's ""special access rules."" (Sprint Compl. ¶ 58; 
see id. ¶¶ 58-62 (criticizing the effectiveness of the FCC's regulatory regime).) At least according to counsel for Sprint, the FCC 
uses the terms ""backhaul"" and ""special access"" interchangeably. (10/24/11 Tr. 65.) This Court will do the same: especially "
1557,," because the FCC's regulations do not factor into the Court's analysis, any distinction between backhaul and special access is 
not particularly relevant here. However, the fact that Sprint makes distinct assertions about backhaul and special access, (see, 
e.g., Sprint Compl. ¶¶ 149, 179-80), without defining the difference between them is illustrative of the complaint's vagueness 
with regard to this market."
1557,45, Calls between  [**74] cellphones are also typically routed through the wireline network. 
1558,46," The parties' disputes as to the application of cases finding antitrust standing when a competitor raises its rivals' costs by 
means of an anticompetitive act are therefore beside the point. (See Joint Opp'n at 39-44 (citing, inter alia, Ford Motor Co. v. 
United States, 405 U.S. 562, 92 S. Ct. 1142, 31 L. Ed. 2d 492 (1972); AlliedSignal, Inc. v. B.F. Goodrich Co., 183 F.3d 568 (7th

 [**78] plaintiffs' characterization of Ford Motor Co.).)"
1558,47," That T-Mobile relies on independent providers for 20 percent of its backhaul needs, (Sprint Compl. ¶ 181), is irrelevant to how 
much the independent providers rely on T-Mobile as a customer."

1559,49," ""'[T]he scheme of the [Clayton Act] is sharply to distinguish between Government suits, either  [**81] criminal or civil, and 
private suits for injunctive relief or for treble damages. Different policy considerations govern each of these. They may proceed

1566,1," Antitrust claims, like patent claims, are subject to exclusive federal jurisdiction. See Marrese v. Am. Academy of Orthopaedic 
Surgeons, 470 U.S. 373, 375, 105 S. Ct. 1327, 84 L. Ed. 2d 274 (1985)."
1566,2," The court dismissed the federal action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction rather than simply denying remand under the then-
applicable doctrine of derivative jurisdiction. Patriot Cinemas, 834 F.2d at 209. ""According to that doctrine, 'a federal district court 
does not have removal jurisdiction over a claim that the state court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to decide in the first place.'"" "
1567,," Id. at 210 (quoting Pueblo International, Inc. v. Reichard De Cardona, 725 F.2d 823, 828 (1st Cir. 1984)). Thus, under the facts 
of the case, there was no federal antitrust action remaining. "
1571,1," Alliance, which is apparently a defunct entity, has not appeared in this action. At the hearing, Plaintiffs asserted that they are 
still pursuing their claims as against Alliance. Thus, Plaintiffs' claims as against Alliance are not dismissed. "
1572,2," The facts as recited in this Order are for the purpose of disposing of the instant motions, and are not to be construed as 
findings of fact that the parties may rely on in future proceedings in this case."
1572,3," The Moving Defendants attached an Affidavit of Sale as exhibit 1 to the Motion to Dismiss Complaint. The Affidavit of Sale had 
several documents, including the Note, attached to it and labeled as Exhibits 1-9. For citation purposes, the Court will refer to the 
Affidavit of Sale as Exhibit 1, and the subsequent attachments as Exhibits 1-1, 1-2, 1-3, and so forth."
1572,4, Attached to the Note was a Prepayment Addendum to Note. Defs.' MTD Compl. Ex. 1-1.
1572,5, Attached to the Mortgage was an Adjustable Rate Rider. Defs.' MTD Compl. Ex. 1-2. 
1574,6," Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(a)(1)(A) provides that a defendant must serve an answer within twenty-one days after being 
served the summons and complaint, or if the defendant waives service, within sixty days after a request for a waiver was sent. 
The docket shows that MERS and Merscorp were served on April 18, 2011, and thus an answer was due by May 9, 2011. Doc. 
No. 7. Central was served on April 21, 2011, and thus an answer due by May 12, 2011. Doc. No. 6. HSBC filed a Waiver of 
Service of Summons on June 29, 2011, and stated therein that the waiver request was sent on April 22, 2011, rendering an 
answer due by June 21, 2011. Doc. No. 22. The Moving Defendants filed the Motion to Dismiss Complaint on June 24, 2011. 
Merscorp filed its Motion for Joinder on August 9, 2011. Doc. No. 32. ACMC was served on May 24, 2011, and timely filed its 
answer, counterclaim, and crossclaim on June 13, 2011. Doc. Nos. 9, 13. "
1575,7," Plaintiffs refused the Court's invitation to consider the Motion to Dismiss as a motion for summary judgment, which would have 
allowed the Court to consider the documents attached to Plaintiffs' Opposition. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(d)(""If, on a motion under 
Rule 12(b)(6) or 12(c), matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion must be treated 
as one for summary judgment under Rule 56.""). The Court will not take judicial notice of the documents attached to Plaintiffs' 
Opposition because the documents are either unreliable or not necessary in deciding the instant motion."
1575,8," The Court also concludes that Plaintiffs' assertion that the Affidavit is not based on the Affiant's personal knowledge because 
the Affiant attests ""to actions that occurred almost exclusively outside of Honolulu, where the Affiant resides,"" and that ""the 
affiant does not claim to have personally witnessed or took part in any of the actions she described,"" are without merit. Pls.' 
Opp'n at 14-15. The Affiant states that at all relevant times she was authorized to act on behalf of Central in the matters set forth 
in the Affidavit, and that the Affidavit was based on her personal knowledge and belief. Defs.' MTD Compl. Ex. 1. She further 
certified that either her or her representative handled the notifications attached to the Affidavit and conducted the public auction 
sale. Id. The Affiant's personal knowledge is therefore apparent from the face of the Affidavit. "
1580,9," Plaintiffs did not submit a copy of the HAMP agreement between Central and Fannie Mae and has not asserted that the 
agreement was not the standard contract used by Fannie Mae. "
1584,10," In the title of Count XIV, Plaintiffs list the claim as against Alliance, Central, and HSBC. Plaintiffs, however, do not make any 
assertions with regard to HSBC in this Count. "
1588,11," Although Plaintiffs claim they were not in default in Count XVII, Plaintiffs also assert that ""[n]othing in this action denies the 
validity of the underlying debt,"" Compl. ¶ 255, that after the economic slowdown in March 2008, they ""began to fall behind in 
their monthly payments,"" id. ¶ 34, and that ""[h]opelessly behind with the mortgage payment . . . Plaintiffs sought assistance to 
modify their loan . . . in April 2009."" Id. ¶ 41. "

1996). "
1592,3, Defendants argue that this demand was required under the litigation procedures of the UFTA. 
1594,1," As Defendants point out in their reply brief, Plaintiff's opposition was untimely. (Reply in Supp. 2, ECF No. 7) This Court issued 
a briefing schedule in its May 13, 2011 Order setting  [*2] May 23, 2011 as the date of filing for Plaintiff's response, and noting 
that the hearing date on the motion was set for June 24, 2011. (Order, May 13, 2011, ECF No. 3) Although the Court notes that 
Plaintiff's opposition was filed on June 3, 2011 and was therefore not in compliance with this Court's Order, because the 
opposition was nevertheless filed within the time for filing an opposition prescribed by Civil Local Rule 7.1.e.2, and because 
Defendants had adequate time and opportunity to file their reply, the Court will consider Plaintiff's opposition in deciding this 
motion. See Civil Local Rule 7.1.e.2 (noting that any response in opposition should be filed ""not later than fourteen (14) calendar 
days prior to the noticed hearing""). Plaintiff is admonished, however, that any future failures to comply with this Court's orders 
may result in penalties. "
1597,2," Plaintiff alleges that a copy of the document ""is presently not available to Plaintiff, inasmuch as the at the time of his purported 
execution of said Promissory Note he was not provided a copy thereof, nor was one provided to him thereafter."" (Compl. ¶ 15, 
ECF No. 1-1) "
1598,3," Having found that Plaintiff has failed to allege sufficient facts to establish one of the essential elements of a claim for 
 [*14] fraud—namely, misrepresentation—the Court will not consider whether the other elements have been sufficiently alleged, 
and makes no final judgment as to their presence or absence in the complaint. In his opposition brief, Plaintiff does not address whether he has alleged sufficient facts of misrepresentation under Rule 9(b), 
instead focusing on his allegations regarding the element of justifiable reliance. (See Resp. in Opp'n 7-8, ECF No. 6) Plaintiff 
notes, however, that he is ""in the process of assembling more evidence in support of all [his] claims, including the cause of 
action for fraud,"" urging the Court to consider granting leave to amend should it grant Defendants' motion to dismiss. (Id. at 8) "
1599,4," The Court also notes that Plaintiff has excluded its wrongful foreclosure claim from its proposed amended complaint, which is 
attached as an exhibit to Plaintiff's Response in Opposition. (See Ex. 1 at 1, ECF No. 6) "
1602,5," Because the Court grants Defendants' motion to dismiss the entire complaint, it DENIES AS MOOT Defendants' motion to 
strike various portions of the complaint. "
