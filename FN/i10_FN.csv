21,2," Wons is not a party to this appeal. Ferry separately appealed from the trial court's order granting Wons's anti-SLAPP motion.

23,4, Ferry has subsequently been declared a vexatious litigant.
23,5," Ferry concedes that her brief is inadequate, attributing its shortcomings to a lack of time to prepare despite this court having 
granted her several filing extensions. We denied her request to file a proposed amended opening brief, finding no good cause to 
restart briefing on a matter that has already been substantially delayed. The proposed brief—almost twice the length of the 
original one—primarily expanded on irrelevant topics and added nothing new to her earlier contentions."
23,6," Karnazes filed a motion to dismiss this appeal on the ground that Ferry's opening brief fails to put forth any facts or authorities 
to support vacating the judgment. In light of our decision to address the substance of Ferry's appeal, Karnazes' motion to "

oral argument by the appellant."" (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.220(a)(2).) "

32,1," On that point, we should clarify one question not before us. The underlying dispute in this case is whether Domino's (as a non-
signatory) has any right to enforce the arbitration agreement as a whole. And both parties have litigated this case on the view 
that the first question we must answer is whether Piersing agreed to arbitrate that question of ""arbitrability."" But there might be 
another, antecedent question here—namely, whether Domino's has any right to enforce the specific provision of the agreement 
in which Piersing purportedly agreed to arbitrate ""arbitrability."" Cf. Rent-A-Center, 561 U.S. at 69-71 (treating the broader 
arbitration agreement as separate from the specific agreement to arbitrate ""arbitrability"" and distinguishing between challenges 
to the former and challenges to the latter). HN3[

on it. See United States v. Sineneng-Smith, 140 S. Ct. 1575, 1579, 206 L. Ed. 2d 866 (2020) (reiterating the ""principle of party

45,4," Graphic initially filed suit against Inline in the District of Delaware. The District of Delaware transferred the case to the District of 
Minnesota. 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 170066, [WL] at *2. Inline successfully petitioned for inter partes review of Graphic's '078 patent. See id. The district court stayed Graphic's patent-
infringement case, and the United States Patent Trial and Appeal Board (""Board"") eventually invalidated the '078 patent. Id. After 
the Federal Circuit affirmed the Board's decision, the district court lifted the stay in the patent-infringement case. Id. Therefore, 
Graphic's patent-infringement case only involves the three design patents. Id. In October 2019, the district court entered an order 
adopting Graphic's claim construction for the asserted patents, see 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 170066, [WL] at *5, and at the filing of

declines to address the merits of this contention, however, because ""[p]arties waive arguments which they develop for the first 
time in a reply brief."" Campos v. Cook County, 932 F.3d 972, 976 n.2 (7th Cir. 2019). "
79,2," The case Vetnique cites in its opening memorandum in support of this contention is inapposite because it involved a defendant 
that contended a party waived and released certain state-law claims, and the court dismissed the case on other grounds without 
addressing that contention. Romo v. Fannie Mae, No. 14 C 10508, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 177824, 2015 WL 10734721, at *1, *3 
(N.D. Ill. Aug. 10, 2015). "
84,1," The Court conditions its dismissal of the counterclaims alleging violations of the Chinese Anti-Unfair Competition Law and the 
Chinese Anti-Monopoly Law on Tongfang Inc's agreement to consent to the jurisdiction of the Chinese courts. See Contact 
Lumber Co. v. P.T. Moges Shipping Co., 918 F.2d 1446, 1450 (9th Cir. 1990) (concluding that a conditional dismissal 
satisfies the legal standard regarding an alternative adequate forum)."
84,2," Tonfang's decision to select this Court for its contract claims against Element (which was proper because of the Guaranty's 
exclusive Los Angeles County forum selection clause) does not establish that this is an appropriate forum for the Element 
Parties' Chinese antitrust law counterclaims. See Maui Jim, Inc. v. SmartBuy Guru Enters., 386 F. Supp. 3d 926, 950-51 (N.D. 
Ill. 2019) (finding dismissal of a foreign antitrust counterclaim on the grounds of forum non conveniens was appropriate even 
though the party arguing for its dismissal chose to litigate in the forum). "
91,1," See also DPWN Holdings (USA), Inc. v. United Air Lines, Inc., 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 63202, 2019 WL 1515231, at *7 
(E.D.N.Y. Feb. 21, 2019) (holding antitrust expert could not testify ""that defendants' conduct was anticompetitive or unlawful"" nor 
""provide any type of conclusion about whether a price-fixing conspiracy existed or whether anticompetitive conduct occurred"" but 
could explain ""that the market was not competitive and explain how he reached that conclusion) (internal alterations, quotation 
marks, and citation omitted); TC Sys. Inc. v. Town of Colonie, N.Y., 213 F. Supp. 2d 171, 182 (N.D.N.Y. 2002) (excluding 
portions of expert opinion that stated impermissible legal conclusions and ""merely [told] the jury what result to reach[,]"" but 
permitting opinions regarding why a local law constituted a barrier to entry into the market at issue). "
92,2," Contrary to Defendants' suggestion, Professor Elhauge is not required to have any personal expertise with dairy farming or 
agricultural cooperatives. See TC Sys. Inc., 213 F. Supp. 2d at 175 (rejecting challenge to antitrust expert's qualifications based 
on expert's lack of experience in telecommunications industry and noting that ""[a]n economist, through his or her educational 
training, is qualified to educate the fact finder about . . . broad economic principles and market forces""). Nor is he required to be 
an economist if, by virtue of his knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, he is qualified to offer an opinion that will be 
helpful to the jury. See Fed. R. Evid. 701; see also In re Mushroom Direct Purchaser Antitrust Litig., 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
120892, 2015 WL 5767415, at * 5 (""There is no serious question that Prof[essor] Elhauge 'posses[es] skill or knowledge' in 
conducting regression analysis in antitrust cases[.]"") (citation omitted). "
96,3," Defendants' reliance on class certification opinions considering the predominance of common issues as required under Fed. R. 
Civ. P. 23(b) in support of their ""fit"" argument underscores that the heart of their challenge is whether Plaintiffs may show 
individualized injury using Professor Elhauge's analysis—a question that the court has already answered in the affirmative. "
100,1," Currax became Somaxon's successors-in-interest to the Agreement in April 2019. (D.I. 316 at 4). The brief in opposition to 
Defendants' motion to enforce the Settlement and License Agreement and the objections to the Report were filed by counsel for 
Currax. (D.I. 302; D.I. 318). When the Court refers to Plaintiffs it is referring to Currax."
100,2," The other three companies were: Par Pharmaceutical, Zydus Pharmaceuticals, and Actavis. (D.I. 302 at 4). Each of these 
companies filed an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) that triggered the litigation. (Id.). An ANDA is filed for a drug that 
is bioequivalent to a drug that has been previously approved and filed pursuant to §355(b)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and 
Cosmetic Act. 21 U.S.C. § 355(b)(1) (2020); 21 U.S.C. § 355(j) (2020). ""Bioequivalence is the absence of a significant difference 
in the rate and extent to which the active ingredient or active moiety in pharmaceutical equivalents or pharmaceutical 
alternatives becomes available at the site of drug action when administered at the same molar dose under similar conditions in 
an appropriately designed study."" U.S. Food & Drug Admin., Orange Book Preface: Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic 
Equivalence Evaluations §1.2 (Feb. 2, 2020), https://www.fda.gov/drugs/development-approval-process-drugs/orange-book-
preface ; 21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(8)(B) (2020). Each company settled with Somaxon and ProCom. (D.I. 302 at 4; D.I. 233; D.I. 235; 
D.I. 237; D.I. 283)."
100,3," ""'Authorized Generic Product' means a Generic Product that is manufactured, used, sold, offered for sale or distributed 
pursuant to the Somaxon [New Drug Application], but that is not marketed under the Trademark."" (D.I. 292-1 ex. A § 1.3). A New 
Drug Application (NDA) refers to stand-alone applications submitted under § 355(b)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic 
Act. 21 U.S.C. § 355(b)(1)."
100,4," Somaxon and ProCom ""[may also] grant one (1) additional License for the AG License Initial Period to a product that is AB 
rated to Silenor 3 mg and 6 mg doxepin hydrochloride tablets, but such product shall not be an Authorized Generic Product."" 
(D.I. 292-1 ex. A § 5.1(a)). An AB rated generic is a ""[d]rug product[] that FDA considers to be therapeutically equivalent to other 
pharmaceutically equivalent products . . . ."" U.S. Food & Drug Admin., Orange Book Preface: Approved Drug Products with 
Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations §1.7 (Feb. 2, 2020), https://www.fda.gov/drugs/development-approval-process-
drugs/orange-book-preface . The company selling the generic must submit ""in vivo and/or in vitro evidence supporting 
bioequivalence"" to receive the AB designation. (Id.). Pursuant to § 5.1(a) of the Agreement Currax granted another generic 
company, Actavis, the right to launch the AB-rated generic version of Silenor® beginning on January 1, 2020, and Actavis' 
generic product is currently on the market. (D.I. 303 at ¶ 18; 3/3/2020 Tr. at 6:4-14). "
101,5," This Court has ancillary jurisdiction to enforce this Agreement because the terms of the Agreement were made ""part of the 
order of dismissal."" (D.I. 233 at 2 § d; D.I. 234); Raab v. City of Ocean City, 833 F.3d 286, 294 (3d Cir. 2016). The parties do not 
dispute the jurisdiction of this Court in deciding this matter. (D.I. 291; D.I. 302). "
102,6," The Court is puzzled as to why Defendants raise this issue. Perhaps it is because of § 11.1 of the Agreement stipulates 
Plaintiffs are entitled to seek injunctive relief or specific performance when there is a material breach by the Defendants. (D.I. 
292-1 ex. A §11.1). As far as the Court can determine, the parties have not contracted around the right to seek relief for a non-
material breach: ""Nothing in this Agreement is intended, or shall be construed, to limit the Parties' rights to equitable relief or any 
other remedy for a breach of any provision of this Agreement."" (D.I. 292-1 ex. A § 11.2). Defendants are also not attempting to 
use the breach by Plaintiffs to justify their own non-performance or to argue that the entire contract should be cancelled. (D.I. 
291 at 9; D.I. 306 at 7). The issue of materiality is irrelevant to the Court's determination."
102,7," Plaintiffs admit they are manufacturing, marketing, and selling their own AG of Silenor®. (D.I. 302 at 16-17)."
102,8," A reverse settlement agreement within the context of pharmaceutical patent infringement is one in which the patentee must pay 
the alleged infringer. F.T.C. v. Actavis, Inc., 570 U.S. 136, 140, 133 S. Ct. 2223, 186 L. Ed. 2d 343 (2013). These agreements 
are not presumptively unlawful. Id. at 158-59."
102,9," The basis of Plaintiffs' non-enforceability defense is that the Agreement violates the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1 (2020). (D.I. 
302 at 11). The Third Circuit's rule-of-reason analysis is controlling authority as federal law governs this analysis. Plaintiffs also 
argue unenforceability under California antitrust law, and that argument is addressed later in this opinion. Infra at 12 & n.19. "
103,10," ""Pay for delay"" is a payment from the brand name drug company to the generic drug company to prevent the 
commercialization of the generic product and to lock other generics out of the market. Herbert Hovenkamp et al., IP and 
Antitrust: An Analysis of Antitrust Principles Applied to Intellectual Property Law §16.01 (3d ed. 2019)."
103,11," Plaintiffs appear to interpret no-AG agreements or anything resembling them to be per se illegal. (D.I. 302; D.I. 318). This 
presumptive illegality is exactly what the Supreme Court rejected in Actavis. See Actavis, Inc., 570 U.S. at 159. The Third Circuit 
has held that a no-AG provision may be analyzed under the rule-of-reason framework, but that is the beginning of the story. King 
Drug Co., 791 F.3d at 403. Plaintiffs must still meet their burden to prove anticompetitive effects. Brown Univ., 5 F.3d at 668. In 
their objection, Plaintiffs assert that the Magistrate Judge did not treat all of their assertions as true, quoting Tiernan, 923 F.2d at 
1032. (D.I. 318 at 2). But Tiernan did not purport to alter established law; there is a difference between an asserted fact, which 
requires some evidentiary support, and the assertions of an attorney, which are entitled to no weight. Plaintiffs offered no 
evidentiary support, and therefore did not create any disputed material facts."
103,12," As the Magistrate Judge noted, there are other theories of anticompetitive harm that may be applicable in this case, but these 
were not advanced by Plaintiffs. (D.I. 316 at 9 n.5)."
103,13," Plaintiffs incorrectly assert that because FTC has publicly mentioned that no-AG agreements may cause consumer harm that 
general statement is sufficient to prove harm in this case. (D.I. 318 at 6)."
103,14," Plaintiffs raise another objection that further supports the Court's view that Plaintiffs misunderstand their initial burden under 
the rule-of-reason analytical framework. (D.I. 318 at 7). Plaintiffs title one of their objections, ""The Report's Holding That Only a "
104,," Contract That Is Illegal 'On Its Face' Can Be Unenforceable Is Contrary to Law."" (D.I. 318 at 7). Plaintiffs then direct the Court to 
the relevant portion of the Report which essentially states there is no case that supports the view that a no-AG provision is per 
se illegal. (D.I. 316 at 7; D.I. 318 at 8). The Magistrate Judge was correct. The Court can find no authority that has found no-AG 
provisions to be per se illegal. In fact, if such a case did exist, it would be in conflict with the Supreme Court's explicit rejection of 
presumptive illegality in Actavis. Supra n. 11. When the Magistrate Judge discussed the fact-intensive inquiry that the Court 
must undertake when determining if a no-AG agreement is illegal, the Magistrate Judge was explaining why Plaintiffs have not 
met their burden to show anticompetitive harm. (D.I. 316 at 8-9). Proving anticompetitive harm is the first step of the rule-of-
reason analysis, and it is a burden that the plaintiff bears. Supra n. 11. Plaintiffs seem to be of the view that merely showing 
these types of agreements have been held to be illegal means all no-AG agreements are illegal. This is a misunderstanding of 
the law. Plaintiffs' objection is dismissed."
104,15," There is no dispute that there is an Agreement, and Defendants have already performed by waiting to launch an AG until the 
agreed-upon date. (D.I. 291 at 2-3, 6; D.I. 302 at 1)."
104,16," Perhaps because of the page limits, Plaintiffs do not renew their objection to the Magistrate Judge's recommendation that I 
order specific performance despite their earlier assertion that ""[they] will suffer significant harm if [they] must pull [their] 
authorized generic Silenor® AG product off the market, as [they] would be forced to absorb the costs and resource expenditures 
associated with a generic product launch."" (D.I. 302 at 16; D.I. 318)."
104,17," Defendants were granted 180 days of semi-exclusivity for their AG starting on January 1, 2020. (D.I. 292-1 ex. A § 1.14(a), 
1.2, 5.1(a)). It is now late-June of 2020. Defendants made no request for expedition. It has only recently come to my attention 
that the motion to enforce was time sensitive."
104,18," The Court must be convinced granting specific performance ""would [not] cause even greater harm than it would prevent."" 
Osborn, 991 A.2d at 1161. The cost of pulling a generic off of the market, to grant the Defendants at most a week of exclusivity, 
strikes the court as harmful for consumers and distributors. It is unnecessarily harmful given the fact that Defendants' alleged 
injuries should be readily quantifiable for the purposes of monetary damages. "
105,19," The Magistrate Judge held that Plaintiffs cannot apply California law retroactively, the statute of limitations has run, and there 
is no private right of action. (D.I. 316 at 14-15). Since Plaintiffs do not dispute the validity of the contractual term that stipulates 
""This Agreement shall be governed, interpreted and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware,"" I am not 
entirely sure why California law would matter in any event. (D.I. 292-1 ex. A § 12.2). "
107,1," Plaintiffs also alleged a claim under Section 10 for scheme liability, but this claim was dismissed by the District Judge [Doc. 76]."
107,2," The Court permitted Plaintiffs Eric Montague and Martin Ziesman, as co-trustee for the Carolyn K. Ziesman Revocable Trust, to 
be substituted as named Plaintiffs in this action. "
109,3," The Court will refer to the Shelf Registration Statement and the prospectus supplements, collectively as the ""Offering 
Documents."" "
110,4," The Court will refer to the Series C and Series D Preferred Stock, collectively as the ""Preferred Stock,"" ""Preferred Securities,"" 
or ""Preferred Shares."" The Court will refer to the common stock, Series C Preferred Stock, and Series D Preferred Stock, 
collectively as the ""Securities"" unless otherwise noted. Finally, the Court will refer to the Section 10 and Section 11 classes, 
collectively as the ""Classes."" "
112,5," Because Plaintiffs move for class certification pursuant to Rule 23(b)(3), the Court has omitted the other statutory provisions. "
118,6," Contemporaneously with the instant Report and Recommendation, the Court has denied Defendant's Motion to Exclude. "
119,7," In O'Neil, the court noted that what is important is ""the volume of shares that they committed to trade, the volume of shares 
they actually traded, and the prices at which they did so."" 165 F.R.D. at 502. "
121,8," The Court notes that the parties also disputed in the filings related to Defendant's Motion to Exclude whether establishing 
Cammer Factor Five is necessary in order to establish market efficiency. In the Memorandum and Order on Defendant's Motion 
to Exclude, the Court noted several courts have found that Cammer Factor Five is necessary, while other courts have found 
otherwise. It appears that most courts utilize the Cammer Factors as analytical tools as opposed to a checklist. Weiner v. Tivity 
Health, Inc., 334 F.R.D. 123, 133 (M.D. Tenn. 2020) (""Indeed, the Sixth Circuit has not mandated use of those factors, and even 
in those cases where the factors are utilized, they are generally deemed to be an analytical tool rather than a checklist. ""); see 
also Monroe Cty. Employees' Ret. Sys. v. S. Co., 332 F.R.D. 370, 385 (N.D. Ga. 2019) (""Accordingly, district courts around the 
country routinely find market efficiency regardless of the fifth Cammer factor."") (collecting cases); Beaver Cty. Employees' Ret. 
Fund v. Tile Shop Holdings, Inc., 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 99479, 2016 WL 4098741, at *10-11 (D. Minn. July 28, 2016) (holding 
plaintiffs satisfied their burden of establishing defendant's stock traded in an efficient market where all of the Cammer and 
Krogman factors weighed in favor of market efficiency except the Fifth Cammer Factor, reasoning that requiring all the Cammer 
factors to be met would change the factors into a ""requirement"" or ""necessity"" which ""has not been explicitly endorsed by the 
courts""). "
126,9," As noted in Petrie v. Electronic Game Card, Inc., ""[F]ew courts have explained how to evaluate how many institutional investors 
constitutes a 'large' number."" 308 F.R.D. 336, 357 (C.D. Cal. 2015). While Coffman has identified several institutional investors 
with respect to the Preferred Securities, there is simply no information on the exact number of the institutional investors or how 
many shares of Preferred Securities that they held. See id. (finding market efficiency when institutional investors held between 
10.9% and 33.4% of defendant's outstanding stock); see also Lumen v. Anderson, 280 F.R.D. 451, 460 (W.D. Mo. 2012) (finding 
that 70 to 140 institutional investors who held between 8 to 20 million shares out of 28 million outstanding shares weighed in 
favor of finding market efficiency). "
128,10," The parties argue in footnotes whether price maintenance theory is viable. See [Doc. 129 at 14 n. 5] and [Doc. 141 at 21 n. 
17]. ""Price maintenance theory"" is the ""theory that a misrepresentation can have a price impact not only by raising a stock's price 
but also by maintaining a stock's already artificially inflated price."" Willis v. Big Lots, Inc., 242 F. Supp. 3d 634, 656 (S.D. Ohio 
2017). While some courts have rejected this this theory, see Ohio Pub. Employees Ret. Sys., 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 137229, 
2018 WL 3861840, (""Lead Plaintiff cannot meaningfully argue that the misrepresentations artificially maintained the price of the 
stock until risks materialized, as that argument proves too much at the class certification stage, where OPERS has the burden of 
persuasion as an evidentiary matter others have approved it.""), others have approved it. See Willis, 242 F. Supp. 3d 634 (finding 
that the price maintenance theory ""is consistent with the Supreme Court's discussions on price impact""). More recently, however, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals declined a defendant's petition to appeal the district court's 
interlocutory order certifying a class action. In re CoreCivic, Inc., No. 19-0504, 2019 U.S. App. LEXIS 25508, 2019 WL 4197586, "
129,," at *1 (6th Cir. Aug. 23, 2019). In doing so, the Court stated that while defendant challenges the framework applied by the district 
court as it relates to the Basic presumption and ""the legal standard for rebutting the presumption of reliance when plaintiffs are 
proceeding under a price maintenance theory, case law supports the legal standard the district court applied."" Id. (citing Ohio 
Pub. Employees Ret. Sys. v. Fed. Home Loan Mort., Corp., 830 F.3d 376, 385 (6th Cir. 2016))."
129,11," The Court notes that in Coffman's Corrected Report, Coffman states that he performed additional analysis on the movements 
of Miller Energy's common stock to information concerning the original reporting of Miller Energy's FY 2011 financial information. 
[Doc. 121 at ¶ vi]. He concludes that the prices of Miller Energy securities were impacted by Defendant's audit reports, 
explaining that out of four (4) audit opinions, there was a statistically significant price movement in response to one audit opinion. 
[Id. at 76] (Exhibit 7]. In the Court's Memorandum and Order on Defendant's Motion to Exclude the Reports and Testimony of 
Chad Coffman [Doc. 126], however, the undersigned struck this opinion because it was a new opinion that Coffman 
acknowledged was not subject of his Initial Report."
129,12," The Court further notes that Dr. Attari acknowledged a price increase after Defendant's first audit opinion was released, but Dr. 
Attari could not determine whether the increase was statistically significant because he had not ""done the work,"" and he had not 
formed an opinion as to what actually caused the price increase. [Doc. 143-2 at 161-62]. "
130,13," Defendant also argues that Kenneth Martin's and Martin Weakley's trading patterns severs the link between the alleged 
misrepresentation and the stock purchases. As mentioned above, however, the Court has allowed these Plaintiffs to withdraw as 
Lead Plaintiffs. Further, for the same reasons as above, the Court does not find Kenneth Martin's and Martin Weakley's trading 
patterns meets Defendant's burden to successfully rebut the Basic presumption."
130,14," The Court has omitted Plaintiffs' citations to ¶¶ 22 and 156. Paragraph 22 simply describes Miller Energy, and ¶ 156 discusses 
AICPA ET (Ethics) Section 101. It is not clear to the Court why Plaintiffs cited these paragraphs in support of their argument. "
134,15," As mentioned above, the Court allowed Kenneth Martin to withdraw as a named Plaintiff in this case. "
140,16," While Plaintiffs cite to NECA-IBEW Health & Welfare Fund for the position that named plaintiffs are not required to have 
purchased a specific security to represent the interests of the purchasers of that security, the undersigned notes that the Second 
Circuit's decision has been criticized. In re Countrywide Fin. Corp. Mortg.-Backed Sec. Litig., 934 F. Supp. 2d 1219, 1229 (C.D. 
Cal. 2013) (""The Court again rejects the reasoning of the Second Circuit's recent decision on class standing.""); Oklahoma Law 
Enf't Ret. Sys. v. Adeptus Health Inc., No. 4:17-CV-00449, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 155055, 2018 WL 4352836, at *6 (E.D. Tex. 
Sept. 12, 2018) (""However, several courts since this decision have declined to follow the class standing doctrine."") (collecting 
cases). While Defendant argued at the hearing that NECA-IBEW Health & Welfare Fund created a circuit split, the parties did not 
sufficiently brief this issue in their filings."
140,17," The Court notes that deferring such a consideration does not defeat the adequacy or typicality requirements. As explained 
above, the adequacy element requires that the representative have common interests, not exact interests, with the unnamed "
141,," members of the class. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4) (Emphasis added). The typicality element requires that the named plaintiffs' 
claims arise out of the claims of other claims members or if the claims are based on the same legal theory. Fed. R. Civ. P. 
23(a)(3). See also In re Dreyfus Aggressive Growth Mut. Fund Litig., No. 98CIV.4318(HB), 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13469, 2000 
WL 1357509, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 20, 2000) (""Courts have repeatedly certified classes where the class representatives had not 
invested in all of the subject securities."")."
141,18," Any objections to this Report and Recommendation must be served and filed within fourteen (14) days after service of a copy 
of this recommended disposition on the objecting party. Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(2). Such objections must conform to the 
requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 72(b). Failure to file objections within the time specified [*115]  waives the right 
to appeal the District Court's order. Thomas v. Arn, 474 U.S. 140, 153-54, 106 S. Ct. 466, 88 L. Ed. 2d 435 (1985). ""[T]he district 
court need not provide de novo review where objections [to the Report and Recommendation] are '[f]rivolous, conclusive or 
general.'"" Mira v. Marshall, 806 F.2d 636, 637 (6th Cir. 1986) (quoting Nettles v. Wainwright, 677 F.2d 404, 410 n.8 (5th "
142,," Cir.1982)). Only specific objections are reserved for appellate review. Smith v. Detroit Federation of Teachers, 829 F.2d 1370, 
1373 (6th Cir. 1987). "
145,1, The Court deducted the costs from the net settlement amount before calculating the fee award. 
146,2," The nature of the case and the extent and quality of the assistance provided to counsel by the Class Representative is unique 
compared to other wage and hour cases in the Court's experience and justifies a higher enhancement than would ordinarily be 
awarded. "
155,1," One chart in evidence showed that in 2011, the beginning of the damages period in this case, Anthem had a 29.7 percent 
share of the California market. Kaiser had 28 percent of the market with Blue Shield at 12 percent, United Health at 8 percent, 
Aetna at 7 percent, Health Net at 6 percent, Cigna at 4 percent and other companies making up the remaining 5 percent of the 
California market."
155,2," PPO plans and health maintenance organization (HMO) plans are two different types of health coverage. Kaiser is an HMO 
available in California's major metropolitan areas. The areas of California where Anthem is the dominant provider are areas 
where Kaiser does not have facilities, and coverage is obtained primarily through the PPO market. "
157,3," The trial court also considered the coercive effect of the Anthem prohibition on wrapping to be further evidence of its market 
power. "
162,1," In reply, the Stores assert that Tauler Smith lacks the standing to oppose the Stores' motion for judgment on the pleadings and, 
thus, the instant motion for reconsideration. (ECF No. 245 at 2-4.) The Court assumes without deciding that Tauler Smith's filing 
can be considered and addresses the arguments in turn. "
163,2," The Stores also contend that a party ""cannot move for judgment on the pleadings with respect to less than a full cause of 
action."" (ECF No. 213-1 at 2) (quoting Living on the Edge, LLC v. Lee, No. CV-14-5982-MWF-JEMX, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS "
164,192532," , 2015 WL 12661917, at *4 (C.D. Cal. Aug. 25, 2015)). While true, that rule does not support a finding that the Court 
erred here. California law permits consumers to allege ""three varieties"" of UCL violations: ""practices which are unlawful, unfair or 
fraudulent."" In re Tobacco II Cases, 46 Cal. 4th 298, 311, 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d 559, 207 P.3d 20 (2009) (quotation omitted). Each 
violation is governed by a different standard and thus supports a distinct claim. See Holt v. Noble House Hotels & Resort, Ltd, 
370 F. Supp. 3d 1158, 1163 (S.D. Cal. 2019) (differentiating each prong of the UCL). Consequently, because Plaintiff alleged 
violations of each prong of the UCL, (Compl. at ¶ 134), the Court did not err in treating the UCL cause of action as alleging three 
distinct claims. Courts of the Ninth Circuit, moreover, regularly permit judgment on the pleading in such circumstances. [*15]  
See Pantastico v. Dep't of Educ., 406 F. Supp. 3d 865, 880 (D. Haw. 2019) (granting motion for judgment on the pleadings with

(""In light of the purpose of Rule 12(c) motions, as stated above, and given that each cause of action in the TAC alleges what

167,3," Plaintiffs formally sued two INVT entities: INVT SPE LLC and Inventergy Global, Inc. "
168,4," As indicated above, Plaintiffs have alleged the acquisition of both substitute and complementary patents. But Plaintiffs' 
complaint largely focuses on substitutes — or at least presumes substitutes are at play. The Court therefore focuses on 
substitutes as well; whether Plaintiffs may have an antitrust claim based on the acquisition of complementary patents alone (i.e., 
without regard to substitute patents) is an issue that the Court need not reach. "
169,5," According to Plaintiffs, aggregation of patents by Fortress and its PAEs also creates problems because the patents are 
deliberately dispersed across various PAEs and ownership of the patents is purposefully obfuscated. See Opp'n at 1; see also 
Compl. ¶¶ 44, 163. ""Because Fortress spreads patents among its PAEs and obfuscates which entities own which patents, 
potential licensees often cannot identify patents that they might want to license or that would be substitutes for patents that a 
PAE is asserting against them."" Opp'n at 7-8. Furthermore, ""there is no single entity that can offer a comprehensive license 
[across] the Fortress portfolio."" Compl. ¶ 45."
169,6," At the hearing on the motion to dismiss, the Court asked Plaintiffs if there could be an antitrust violation if Defendants engaged 
in serial litigation involving weak patents that did not involve substitutes and complements. Plaintiffs expressly disavowed 
making such a claim. "
170,7," At the hearing on the motion to dismiss, Apple maintained that the transfer of even a single SEP under the circumstances 
detailed herein (i.e., transfer to a non-operating PAE) was illegal because, as noted below, a PAE is not subject to tempering 
market forces that assume compliance with standard-setting rules; but, Apple added, the aggregation of such SEPs by Fortress 
and its PAEs enhanced the violation of the law."
170,8," ""FRAND"" means fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory. "
174,9," ""Elasticity of demand is a concept used to signify the relationship between changes in price and responsive changes in

Servs., 504 U.S. 451, 469, 112 S. Ct. 2072, 119 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1992) (indicating that cross-elasticity of demand refers to ""the 
extent to which consumers will change their consumption of one product in response to a price change in another"")."
174,10," As noted above, the Court acknowledges that Plaintiffs have put at issue both substitutes and complements. However, for 
purposes of the analysis here, the Court need only focus on substitutes."
174,11, It is not clear from ¶ 102 whether the eight patents at issue have eliminated substitutes. 
175,12," In their motion, Defendants argue that, even if Plaintiffs did present nonconclusory allegations of market power, Plaintiffs' case 
would still founder because ""weak"" patents cannot give rise to market power; in other words, if patents are weak, then they 
cannot be used to control prices, exclude competition, and so forth. See Mot. at 15-16. At this early stage of the proceedings, 
however, the Court is not in a position to say that this could never be true, especially in view of Plaintiffs' theory of aggregation 
and the ability to extract supracompetitive prices. See also Docket No. 133-1 (amicus brief filed by the Electronic Frontier 
Foundation). "
176,13," Although the Court does not make any ruling on the matter at this time, it does find questionable Defendants' argument that 
Apple's claim is not viable without allegations that the SSO considered alternative technology and would have adopted the 
technology but for the defendant's misconduct. As Apple notes, it is not claiming that misconduct took place during the standard-
setting process but rather after. In other words, Apple is not arguing that an antitrust violation occurred because defendants 
acquired a monopoly unlawfully; rather, it is arguing that Defendants violated the ""spirit"" of the antitrust laws by now deviating 
from the FRAND commitment subsequent to the standard-setting process. (Admittedly, there is a fair argument that such 
conduct constitutes a breach of contract.) On the other hand, it is also questionable whether Apple can simply allege that Defendants claim to own SEPs instead of 
alleging that Defendants own or control patents that actually are SEPs. See, e.g., Compl. ¶ 56 (alleging that Uniloc obtained 
""patents claimed to be [SEPs] for cellular standards that originated with [Philips]""). If a SEP is a problem because it effectively 
eliminates substitutes as a practical matter (i.e., businesses have an interest in conforming with a standard in order to sell their 
products), then it is not clear why Apple can avoid pleading that Defendants have patents that are in fact SEPs. At the hearing, 
Apple indicated that, in the Apple v. Samsung litigation, Judge Koh did not require Apple to plead that the patents at issue were, 
in fact, SEPs, but Apple did not provide Judge Koh's reasoning on this point. "
178,14," In Professional Real Estate Investors, the Supreme Court outline[d] a two-part definition of ""sham"" litigation. First, the lawsuit must be objectively baseless in the sense that no 
reasonable litigant could realistically expect success on the merits. If an objective litigant could conclude that the suit is 
reasonably calculated to elicit a favorable outcome, the suit is immunized under Noerr, and an antitrust claim premised on 
the sham exception must fail. Only if challenged litigation is objectively meritless may a court examine the litigant's 
subjective motivation. Under this second part of our definition of sham, the court should focus on whether the baseless 
lawsuit conceals ""an attempt to interfere directly with the business relationships of a competitor"" through the ""use [of] the 
governmental [*42]  process - as opposed to the outcome of that process — as an anticompetitive weapon."" Professional Real Estate Investors, 508 U.S. at 60-61 (emphasis in original)."
178,15," In California Motor Transport, the Supreme Court noted that [t]here are many . . . forms of illegal and reprehensible practice which may corrupt the administrative or judicial processes 
and which may result in antitrust violations. [For example,] [o]ne claim, which a court or agency may think baseless, may go 
unnoticed; but a pattern of baseless, repetitive claims may emerge which leads the factfinder to conclude that the 
administrative and judicial processes have been abused. California Motor Transport, 404 U.S. at 513."
178,16," In their papers, Defendants question whether Ninth Circuit law — which makes the above distinction between sham petitioning 
— as opposed to Federal Circuit should apply. See Mot. at 25 n.11 (citing Nobelpharma AB v. Implant Innovations, Inc., 141 
F.3d 1059, 1068 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (stating that ""whether conduct in procuring or enforcing a patent is sufficient to strip a patentee 
of its immunity from the antitrust laws is to be decided as a question of Federal Circuit law"")). However, Ninth Circuit law applies 
with respect to this distinction which concerns the First Amendment, even when the underlying issue is whether a series of 
patent infringement lawsuits is protected by the Noerr-Pennington doctrine. See generally Kaiser, 552 F.3d at 1033. "

197,2," AquaChile seeks dismissal of Plaintiffs' interference claims with prejudice. Despite AquaChile's contention that Plaintiffs are 
unable to allege facts to support the independent wrongful act requirement of their interference claims, the Court is not 
convinced that Plaintiffs would be unable to cure their deficiencies. See Masuda v. Citibank, N.A., 38 F. Supp. 3d 1130, 1133

215,2," At hearing, Aerojet argued Rule 9(b) applies only to the ""fraudulent"" prong of its UCL claim, as the ""unlawful"" and ""unfair"" 
prongs are not grounded in fraud. This argument is unavailing. In Kearns, plaintiff-appellant advanced a similar argument, 
arguing that because some of his claims were not grounded in fraud, Rule 9(b) should not apply. 567 F.3d at 1125. In 
dispatching this argument, the court explained that while fraud itself may not be a necessary element under the UCL, when a 
complaint ""allege[s] a unified course of fraudulent conduct and rel[ies] entirely on that course of conduct as the basis of that 
claim[,] . . . the claim is said to be 'grounded in fraud' or to 'sound in fraud[,]'"" and the pleading, ""as a whole"" is subject to Rule 
9(b). Id; see also Hadley v. Kellogg Sales Co., 243 F. Supp. 3d 1074, 1094 (N.D. Cal. 2017) (""Where Plaintiff has alleged a

256,6," Following the legal director's comments, the parties returned to the district court and ChampionsWorld moved to lift the 
previously imposed stay pending arbitration. ChampionsWorld, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 90661, 2008 WL 4861522, at *2 (N.D. Ill. 
Nov. 7, 2008). The court explained that while it was apparent that the FIFA arbitration tribunal would not ""entertain the antitrust 
... issues,"" it was still unclear whether it would arbitrate any of the other issues presented. Id. at *3. Ultimately, USSF 
reformulated the remaining claims and presented its own case for arbitration; USSF did not request that the arbitral tribunal 
adjudicate plaintiff's antitrust claim. See ChampionsWorld, 276 F.R.D. 577, 584 (N.D. Ill. 2011). The district court ultimately ruled 
on the merits of the antitrust claim. ChampionsWorld, LLC v. U.S. Soccer Fed'n, Inc., 890 F. Supp. 2d 912, 951 (N.D. Ill. 2012)."
256,7," Defendant relies on the ChampionsWorld court's initial decision compelling ChampionsWorld's claims to arbitration to argue 
that Relevent's antitrust claim should similarly be sent to arbitration in the first instance. See ChampionsWorld, 487 F. Supp. 2d 
980, 991 (N.D. Ill. 2007). This argument ignores ChampionsWorld's subsequent procedural history. Specifically, later decisions 
in ChampionsWorld explain that the initial decision to compel the antitrust claim to arbitration was made before the FIFA tribunal 
""stated for the first time that Plaintiff's ... antitrust claims were not within the categories of disputes that its regulations allowed its 
deciding bodies to hear."" ChampionsWorld, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 90661, 2008 WL 4861522, at *1 (N.D. Ill. Nov. 7, 2008). 
Thus, compelling the antitrust claim in the instant case to arbitration, knowing full well that FIFA's arbitral body has no jurisdiction 
to decide it, would be futile and inefficient. See In re Salomon Inc. S'holders' Derivative Litig. 68 F.3d at 554; De Malmanche, 
2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 62695, 2010 WL 2541495, at *4. "
257,8," The Court notes that arbitration of Plaintiff's tortious interference claim may present additional difficulties. Based on the 
ChampionsWorld procedural history, it is likely that USSF will need to substitute Stillitano as the opposing party and present its 
own case for arbitration so that the claim is limited to interpreting FIFA's own statutes and regulations. See ChampionsWorld, 
276 F.R.D. at 584; ChampionsWorld, 890 F. Supp. 2d at 922. Nevertheless, given the plain language of the Agreement and the 
fact that, unlike the antitrust claim, Plaintiff's tort claim appears to only require interpretation of FIFA's statutes rather than U.S. 
antitrust law, the claim is compelled to arbitration in the first instance."
257,9," Defendant also moves to dismiss on the grounds that Plaintiff's claims are barred by the parties' prior covenant not to sue and 
that FIFA is an indispensable party. Def. Mem. of Law, Dkt. 33 at 15-24. Because the Court finds that Plaintiff fails to state an 
antitrust claim, the Court need not reach these other arguments. As will be discussed briefly infra, however, even if Plaintiff had 
stated a claim, its claim for injunctive relief would be subject to dismissal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 19. "
258,10," Plaintiff claims that, because it plausibly alleged a conspiracy ""through direct evidence—including USSF's admissions and the 
rules and policies of FIFA and its affiliated members (including the FIFA Policy), it was not required to plead parallel conduct and 
""plus factors"" to infer such a conspiracy."" Pl. Opp., Dkt. 35 at 28. "
259,11," As noted, infra, Plaintiff may move for leave to amend its complaint. Because there are obvious rational reasons why USSF 
would comply with the FIFA Directive without being part of an agreement to do so (most notably its desire not to take action that 
could result in all U.S. men's soccer players and teams being deemed ineligible for World Cup play, see Compl. ¶¶ 32, 34), if 
Plaintiff chooses to amend its Complaint, it must plead facts, beyond Defendant's mere acquiescence to the FIFA Directive, from 
which the Court can infer that there is an unlawful agreement between USSF and FIFA."
259,12," Even if Plaintiff had adequately alleged an agreement between USSF and FIFA, Plaintiff's claim for injunctive relief would be 
dismissed for failure to join an indispensable party. In deciding to dismiss a claim pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 19, 
the Court must: (i) determine whether the absent party is ""necessary"" to the action under Rule 19(a) and (ii) assess whether 
joinder of the party is feasible, and if not, whether the party is indispensable under Rule 19(b). Viacom Int'l, Inc. v. Kearney, 212 
F.3d 721, 724 (2d Cir. 2000). FIFA is a necessary party under Rule 19(a)(1)(A); the Court cannot accord Plaintiff the relief it seeks, the ability to promote and 
host Official Games in the United States, in FIFA's absence. See Meyer v. Kalanick, No. 15- CV-9796, 2016 WL 3509496, at *2 
(S.D.N.Y. June 20, 2016). At the heart of Plaintiff's claim is the FIFA directive that prohibits the staging of Official Games outside 
the participant leagues' home territory. Plaintiff acknowledges that all FIFA-affiliated confederations, associations, leagues, 
clubs, and players ""must comply with FIFA's rules"" or face discipline. Compl. ¶¶ 34, 59, 60. Thus, even if the Court were to 
enjoin USSF from complying with the FIFA directive and order it to sanction Plaintiff's proposed matches, so long as the directive 
itself remains, Plaintiff will have difficulty obtaining the other approvals it needs to host a match. See Def. Mem. of Law, Dkt. 33 
at 21 n.25; Kraebel v. N.Y.C. Dep't of Hous. Pres. & Dev., No. 90-CV-4391, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4619, 1994 WL 132239 
(S.D.N.Y. Apr. 14, 1994). Joinder of FIFA is infeasible for lack of personal jurisdiction. The complaint fails to allege sufficient facts to establish FIFA's 
contacts with the Southern District of New York. In the absence of such facts, the Court cannot exercise personal jurisdiction 
over FIFA pursuant to the Clayton Act or the New York long arm statute. See In re SSA Bonds Antitrust Litig., 420 F. Supp. 3d 
219, 230 (S.D.N.Y. 2019); Dennis v. JPMorgan Chase & Co., 345 F. Supp. 3d 122, 198-99 (S.D.N.Y. 2018). Nor does the 
complaint allege sufficient ""overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy"" taken by USSF in New York to impute to FIFA under the 
Schwab conspiracy theory. See Charles Schwab Corp. v. Bank of Am. Corp., 883 F.3d 68, 87 (2d Cir. 2018); In re SSA Bonds "
260,," Antitrust Litig., 420 F. Supp. at 239 (holding that plaintiffs did not meet ""their burden of establishing conspiracy jurisdiction"" 
because they ""provide[d] no evidence as to any specific transactions that occurred in New York""). Finally, exercising personal 
jurisdiction over FIFA would violate due process. Even adopting the national contacts approach, the complaint does not 
adequately allege that the FIFA directive was expressly aimed at the United States. Walden v. Fiore, 571 U.S. 277, 289, 134 S. 
Ct. 1115, 188 L. Ed. 2d 12 (2014) (mere foreseeability of harm is insufficient to establish specific jurisdiction); U.S. Bank Nat'l 
Ass'n v. Bank of Am. N.A., 916 F.3d 143, 151 (2d Cir. 2019) (explaining that it is insufficient ""for a plaintiff to show simply that a 
defendant's actions caused an 'effect' in the forum state""; the plaintiff must show that the defendant has ""expressly aimed its 
conduct at the forum."") (quoting Licci ex rel. Licci v. Leb. Can. Bank, SAL, 732 F.3d 161, 173 (2d Cir. 2013); Sonterra Cap. 
Master Fund Ltd. v. Credit Suisse Grp. AG, 277 F. Supp. 3d 521, 589-90 (S.D.N.Y. 2017) (explaining that the mere knowledge 
that a directive would be ""disseminated worldwide, including into the United States, is not enough by itself to support specific 
personal jurisdiction because foreseeability alone has never been a sufficient benchmark for personal jurisdiction under the Due 
Process Clause."") (internal quotation marks omitted). Lastly, FIFA is an indispensable party under Rule 19(b) because a judgment rendered in its absence would be inadequate. As 
long as the FIFA directive remains, Plaintiff will likely be unable to obtain the requisite approvals to promote an official game and 
players will remain under threat of discipline from FIFA if they participate in such games. Plaintiff will likely be required to resort 
to ""piecemeal litigation"" to enjoin other confederations, associations, leagues, teams, players, and even FIFA itself from adhering 
to the directive, which is precisely what Rule 19 seeks to avoid. Kermanshah v. Kermanshah, No. 08-CV-409, 2010 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 45896, 2010 WL 1904135, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. May 11, 2010); Freedom, N.Y. Inc. v.United States, No. 86-CV-1363, 1986 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25050, 1986 WL 6163, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. May 27, 1986)."
260,13," Although Plaintiff's opposition asserts that the ""alleged co-conspirator Confederations, National Associations, leagues, and 
teams [] do compete with each other,"" it cites to no supporting factual allegations in the complaint. Pl. Opp., Dkt. 35 at 30. 
Moreover, it alleges that the relevant market ""in which USSF's conduct has unreasonably restrained competition"" is the ""market 
for International Soccer Game Events"" in the United States, Compl. ¶ 47, a market in which none of its alleged horizontal 
competitors appears to compete."
260,14," The Court also notes that Plaintiff's allegations of a horizontal agreement among USSF and ""all of the FIFA-affiliated 
Confederations, National Associations, leagues, and teams,"" to comply with the FIFA Directive, Pl. Opp., Dkt. 35 at 29-30, flies 
in the face of its allegation that Plaintiff had obtained approval from Ecuador's Regional Confederation, Ecuador's National 
Association, and the participating teams' league in advance of its proposed May 5, 2019 game. Compl. ¶ 96. "
261,15," Plaintiff seemingly relies on FC Barcelona's statement regarding Plaintiff's proposed FC Barcelona-Girona game to support 
the existence of an agreement. See Pl. Opp., Dkt. 35 at 29. After the FIFA Directive was issued, FC Barcelona withdrew its 
commitment to participate in the game, explaining that it ""was [] willing to play a La Liga match in Miami . . . but acknowledge[d] 
that while there is no agreement between all parties, this project will not succeed."" Compl. ¶ 93. The Court is not entirely clear in 
what way Plaintiff is relying on this statement. See Pl. Opp., Dkt. 35 at 29. To the extent that Plaintiff is using this statement to 
demonstrate a vertical agreement between USSF and FIFA, it is insufficient. This statement merely suggests that USSF 
declined to sanction a game that would have been in violation of the FIFA Directive, which, as noted supra, without additional 
factual allegations, does not suggest that USSF entered an unlawful agreement with FIFA. To the extent that Plaintiff is using FC 
Barcelona's statement to support the allegation of a horizontal agreement between USSF and ""numerous coconspirator 
confederations, national associations, leagues, and teams,"" Pl. Opp., Dkt. 35 at 28-29, it similarly fails. Although FC Barcelona's 
reference to ""all parties"" is admittedly vague, the statement seems to undermine Plaintiff's position by suggesting that there is, in 
fact, no ""agreement"" among the various confederations, national associations, leagues, and teams."
261,16," Plaintiff's failure to allege a horizontal agreement also dooms its hub-and-spoke conspiracy theory. Pl. Opp., Dkt. 35 at 30. A 
hub-and-spoke conspiracy requires: (1) a hub; (2) entities that enter into vertical agreements with the hub, known as the spokes; 
and (3) the connecting agreements among the horizontal competitors, known as the rim of the wheel. Apple, Inc., 791 F. 3d at 
314; In re Elec. Books Antitrust Litig., 859 F. Supp. 2d 671, 690 (S.D.N.Y. 2012). As noted, supra, Plaintiff fails to allege a 
vertical agreement between FIFA and USSF and fails to allege anything approaching a rim to the asserted wheel. "
265,1," However, the Court has limited the scope of these claims as they relate to ACT's claimed certification marks. (See Doc. 160.) "
267,2," ACT also argues that WIN's existing counterclaims should be dismissed for lack of standing. (See Doc. 389, at 2.) However, 
the time for dispositive motions on these claims has long passed. (See Doc. 164.) ACT did not raise this standing issue in a 
timely 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss nor did it raise the issue in its summary judgment motion on WIN's counterclaims. (See Doc. 
209.) The time for arguing pleading deficiencies relating to the counterclaims in the original pleadings or the first amended 
pleadings has long passed, and the Court will not consider such arguments now. For the sake of deciding WIN's motion to 
amend, the Court will only consider the standing issue and other arguments as they relate to the new factual allegations WIN 
seeks to add. "
270,3," The Court notes, however, that the presumption can be ""overcome by evidence of no marketplace injury."" Bhelliom, 529 F. 
App'x at 566. ACT is free to present or identify such evidence at trial. "
272,4," WIN purports to bring its intentional-interference-with-business-relations claim under Tennessee law, and ACT responds in 
accordance with Tennessee law, despite noting that it ""does not concede that Tennessee law applies and refers to it only for this 
motion."" (See Doc. 376, at 6; Doc. 389, at 15 n.5.) Neither party, however, raises any choice-of-law arguments or suggests that 
another state's law governs this claim. To the extent there is a choice-of-law issue, the Court applies the conflict-of-law rules of 
the forum in which it sits, Tennessee. Johnson v. Ventra Grp., Inc., 191 F.3d 732, 738 (6th Cir. 1999). In tort cases, Tennessee 
follows the ""most significant relationship"" test outlined in the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws. Hataway v. McKinley, 
830 S.W.2d 53, 59 (Tenn. 1992). Under this test, the law of the state in which the injury occurred applies unless some other has 
a more significant relationship to the controversy. Id. at 57. Here, it is unclear where the injury ""occurred."" Presumably the letter 
was received by the State of Arizona in Arizona, though this is not mentioned by either party. Even so, WIN alleges that other 
similar letters were sent to other states, including Kentucky and South Carolina. (Doc. 375-2, at 52.) Additionally, neither party 
indicated where the letter was written or sent from or where the relevant business relationship between WIN and its customers is 
centered. Because the parties have not briefed the issue, the Court has no basis to determine that any other state has a more 
significant relationship with the claim than Tennessee, the state where WIN is incorporated and from which it operates. Thus, for 
the purposes of analyzing this motion, the Court will apply Tennessee law. To the extent that Arizona law—or Kentucky or South 
Carolina law—is more appropriate, the parties may raise this argument in connection with their proposed jury instructions. "
290,1," As the Second Circuit recently explained, ""[t]he term 'primary aluminum' is used in the industry to describe aluminum in the 
form produced at a smelter or primary aluminum plant, by original producers, as distinguished from 'secondary aluminum,' which 
is reconstituted aluminum scrap."" Eastman Kodak Co. v. Henry Bath LLC, 936 F.3d 86, 88 (2d Cir. 2019) (""Aluminum VI""). "

Warehousing Antitrust Litig., 833 F.3d 151 (2d Cir. 2015) (""Aluminum III""); Aluminum VI, 936 F.3d 86. The Court's account of the 
facts here is drawn primarily from the FLPs' Third Amended Complaint, Dkt. 738 (""TAC""), and the parties' submissions in 
connection with the FLPs' motions. The Court has considered the following submissions by the FLPs in support of their motions: 
the declaration of Susan R. Schwaiger, Esq., Dkt. 920 (refiled as Dkt. 1237) (""Schwaiger Decl.""), and exhibits attached thereto; 
the declaration of Steven M. Jodlowski, Esq., Dkt. 1041 (refiled as Dkt. 1239) (""Jodlowski Decl.""), and exhibits attached thereto; 
and two declarations of Carmen A. Medici, Esq., Dkt. 1039 (refiled as Dkt. 1241) (""First Medici Decl.""); Dkt. 1195 (refiled as Dkt. 
1240) (""Second Medici Decl.""), and exhibits attached thereto. The Court has also considered the following submissions by 
defendants in opposition to the motions: the declaration of Henry Liu, Esq., Dkt. 1014 (""Liu Decl.""), and exhibits attached thereto; 
two declarations of John S. Playforth, Esq., Dkt. 1164 (""First Playforth Decl.""); Dkt. 1199 (""Second Playforth Decl.""), and exhibits 
attached thereto; and the declaration of William H. Wagener, Esq., Dkt. 1167 (""Wagener Decl.""), and exhibits attached thereto. 
And the Court has considered the exhibits attached to three joint letters solicited by the Court and submitted by the parties, Dkt. 
1253 (""First Joint Ltr.""); Dkt. 1256 (""Second Joint Ltr.""); Dkt. 1258 (""Third Joint Ltr.""), which the Court discusses further infra. "

and, where appropriate, the Court does so as well."
292,6," The TAC named several additional entities as ""Glencore Defendants."" TAC ¶ 110. Judge Forrest dismissed Glencore plc for 
lack of personal jurisdiction, In re Aluminum Warehousing Litig., 90 F. Supp. 3d 219, 223 (S.D.N.Y. 2015), and denied leave to 
amend to add Glencore International AG (""GIAG"") and Glencore UK Ltd., see In re Aluminum Warehousing Litig., 2016 U.S.

*7-9. "
294,10, Other regional premia include the Rotterdam Premium and the CIF Japan Premium. TAC ¶ 185.
294,11," The Gilbert Report was initially filed as Exhibit A to the Schwaiger Declaration, but a corrected version, with minimal changes, 
was later filed. The Court refers throughout to the corrected Gilbert Report. "
295,12," The first 10 exhibits to the Schwaiger Declaration are labeled A through J, after which the exhibits are numbered, beginning at 
1, and occasionally stretch across multiple docket entries. For example, Exhibit 25 to the Schwaiger Declaration is at docket 
1237-35 and 1237-36."
295,13," Each futures contract represents an agreement to buy or sell high-grade primary aluminum in 25 metric ton lots, in the future, 
at a fixed price. Kaplan Decl. ¶ 32. For a given batch of aluminum to be eligible to back an LME futures contract, it must meet 
LME specifications as to the level of purity of the metal and be produced, by an LME-approved brand, in the shape of an ingot, t-
bar, or sow. Id."
295,14," As the Second Circuit has explained: ""In general, there are two types of warehouses that stockpile aluminum: those that are 
affiliated with the [LME] and those that are not. Warehouses that are not affiliated with the LME typically store aluminum for 
users of physical aluminum, e.g., producers, fabricators, and manufacturers, and are located near those users of physical 
aluminum. LME-warehouses typically store aluminum for derivatives traders and are located all over the world."" Aluminum III, 
833 F.3d at 154."
295,15," ""[A]n LME warrant is a standardized document issued by the [LME] warehouse upon delivery of a [25 metric ton] lot of 
aluminum into the warehouse to indicate who has the right of possession of that [particular] lot of aluminum."" TAC ¶ 195. To 
issue a warrant means that ""aluminum has been checked into such a warehouse for storage,"" and to cancel a warrant means 
that ""the aluminum has been earmarked for delivery from the warehouse."" Id."
295,16," Industrial users of aluminum do, however, engage in some trading on the LME—generally to hedge their exposure to changes 
in aluminum prices and, occasionally, as a supply of last resort, to purchase limited amounts of their aluminum requirements. 
TAC ¶ 196. "
296,17," The FLPs also provide relevant excerpts from the Senate Report in their declarations in support of class certification. See, 
e.g., Second Medici Decl., Ex. 5."
296,18," According to defendants, the fact that Metro Detroit and Pacorini Vlissingen warrants were used to specify almost all LME 
futures contracts during the class period also meant that the value of those warrants determined the price at which the LME 
futures contracts traded. See Hausman Decl. ¶ 15. The Court reviews this theory in greater detail infra. "
297,19," For this reason, queues are beneficial to warehouses. See, e.g., Schwaiger Decl., Ex. 2 (""If there is a long queue of outbound 
metal, inflows will have a known minimum stay in the warehouse and generate a minimum known rent income.""). "
298,20," See also Dkt. 1272 (""OA Tr."") at 88 (""The contango is making it profitable to store [aluminum] in a warehouse. . . . [I]f [a trader 
or financial institution is] storing aluminum and holding it in a cash-and-carry trade,"" then industrial users or arbitrageurs who 
wish to acquire that aluminum out of storage ""have to be willing to outbid the contango.""). "
300,21," As early as May 2010, a J.P. Morgan trader worried that this ""self-perpetuating"" dynamic would make it impossible for any 
other warehouse to catch up to Metro: ""I therefore can't see what is going to stop Metro getting further and further ahead with 
being able to bid [large incentives] and tie all the [aluminum] up in Detroit."" Liu Decl., Ex. 28. Having failed to purchase Metro, 
J.P. Morgan began ""gunning for Metro Detroit,"" encouraging regulatory action by the LME to slow Metro's rise. Id., Ex. 31 at ECF 
p. 2. In particular, J.P. Morgan's Henry Bath subsidiary lobbied the LME to cap the amount of aluminum that could be stored in 
Metro Detroit and to ban Metro's practice of paying large incentives for new deposits of aluminum. See, e.g., id., Ex. 27 (Henry 
Bath submission to LME stating that Metro had ""reached a critical mass"" in Detroit and arguing that, absent a cap, ""the Detroit 
trend will continue unchecked"")."
300,22," In the same conversation, when asked about his ""key concerns for the business,"" Wibbelman responded that ""a white hot 
economy"" and ""financing banks taking all the metal and storing them in off-warrant facilities""—i.e., outside of Metro's LME 
warehouses—were ""what kept him awake at night."" Schwaiger Decl., Ex. 5 at 5. "
301,23," At argument, the FLPs referred to these events as ""proprietary cancellations."" See Dkt. 1270 (FLPs' oral argument 
presentation) at 15-16. "
302,24," Glencore accounted for 91,400 tons' worth of these warrant cancellations; the balance involved non-parties Deutsche Bank or 
Red Kite. Prichard Decl. ¶ 6. "
303,25," Judge Forrest also denied the motion to amend to the extent it sought to ""expand[] the case beyond primary aluminum to also 
include secondary aluminum."" In re Aluminum Warehousing Antitrust Litig., 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 54643, 2016 WL 1629350, at 
*6; see also Aluminum VI, 936 F.3d at 88 (FLPs allege ""a conspiracy to inflate prices in the primary aluminum market . . . as 
distinguished from the 'secondary aluminum'""). "
305,26," The FLPs had initially submitted these documents on December 5, 2019. In that filing, the Second Medici Declaration attached 
the declaration of a previously undisclosed expert, Jorge Vazquez Serna. Second Medici Decl., Ex. 2. Defendants challenged 
the propriety of the 11th-hour expert declaration, and the FLPs agreed to withdraw it. See Dkt. 1184. On December 18, 2019, 
the FLPs submitted the operative versions of their sur-reply filings, discussed above. However, the parties agreed that removing 
references to the Vazquez Serna declaration would cause more confusion than leaving such references in place. Accordingly, 
the FLPs' sur-reply contains citations to the withdrawn declaration, which the Court has disregarded."
305,27," On April 14, 2020, the Court requested that the parties either re-file or email courtesy copies of each of the above-described 
submissions in light of challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic and the District's upgraded technological capacity (and "
306,," the Court's correspondingly updated Individual Rules) relating to the electronic filing of documents under seal. Dkt. 1234; see 
Dkt. 1235. On April 24, 2020, the FLPs re-filed their briefs and declarations, see Dkts. 1236-42, and the defendants emailed 
courtesy copies of theirs."
306,28," The parties, with the Court's permission, used slide presentations in connection with their oral arguments. On June 30, 2020, 
at the request of the Court, the parties filed those presentations on ECF. See Dkts. 1264-65, 1270. "
307,29," See, e.g., In re Intel Corp. Microprocessor Antitrust Litigation, No. 05 MD 1717 (LPS), 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 165261, 2014 
WL 6601941, at *15-16 (D. Del. Aug. 6, 2014) (""Intel"") (""The Court is persuaded by Defendant's expert, Mr. Kaplan . . . [that 
plaintiffs' expert] fails to account for many of the real-world facts surrounding this complicated market . . . . Consequently, as Mr. 
Kaplan testified . . . tracing [a] purported overcharge through the distribution chain . . . is going to require a highly individualized 
analysis.""). "
314,30," Econometrics is a ""branch of economics that expresses economic theory in mathematical terms."" In re Mushroom Direct 
Purchaser Antitrust Litig., No. 06 Civ. 620 (TNO), 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 120892, 2015 WL 5767415, at *4 (E.D. Pa. July 29, 
2015)."
314,31," The FLPs assert that the paper's analysis is in tension with some of Kaplan's criticisms of Dr. Gilbert's model. The paper 
indeed contained different economic analysis—for a project of a different nature than his undertaking here. See Kaplan Daubert 
Decl. ¶¶ 93-100 (summarizing differences between the 1998 paper and Kaplan's opinions here). This critique, however, goes to 
weight, and is not a basis for exclusion under Daubert. See, e.g., Revelation Capital Mgmt., 215 F. Supp. 3d at 274; In re Air 
Cargo Shipping Servs. Antitrust Litig., No. 06 MD 1175 (JG) (VVP), 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 180914, 2014 WL 7882100, at *18 
(E.D.N.Y. Oct. 15, 2014), report and recommendation adopted, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 90402, 2015 WL 5093503 (E.D.N.Y. July 
10, 2015). "
315,32," Kaplan's is only one expert report offered by the defense in opposition to class certification. Had the Court excluded Kaplan's 
report under Daubert, the expert testimony of Dr. Hausman, which is not subject to a Daubert challenge, would remain, and 
would independently (indeed more fulsomely) support the critical propositions articulated by Kaplan, including as to the absence 
of classwide market impact. For avoidance of doubt, the Court's resolution of the FLPs' Daubert motion has not affected its 
resolution of the pending class-certification motion."
315,33," See In re FX, 407 F. Supp. 3d at 428 n.5 (""As there has been at least one round of adversarial briefing on the class definitions 
set forth in plaintiffs' reply, those are the definitions that are analyzed here."" (citation omitted)). "
318,34," Indeed, defendants have raised precisely the opposite concern in connection with their adequacy and predominance 
arguments, discussed infra. "
319,35," Defendants have not challenged the adequacy of the FLPs' counsel. The Court finds that estimable plaintiffs' counsel, who 
have played an energetic and leading role in this MDL for the better part of a decade, are well-qualified. They would more than 
adequately represent a class in this complex case—if such a class were otherwise properly certified. See OA Tr. at 60 
(commending the FLPs' lead counsel for ""responding effectively under considerable fire and in . . . to say the least, [a] 
complicated matter"")."
319,36," Defendants relatedly suggest that two named plaintiffs, Custom Aluminum and Extruded Aluminum, themselves seek to 
recover for ""second-level purchases from other potential class members,"" raising a fundamental conflict by ""weaken[ing] the 
claims of the latter entities"" and ""raising the troubling specter of duplicative recovery."" Def. Opp'n at 61; see Def. Sur-Reply at 
29-30. However, these concerns are purely speculative at this stage. The FLPs seek to certify a class of persons who ""made a 
first level purchase of a primary aluminum product,"" Pl. Reply at 6 (emphasis added), and only first-level purchases of aluminum 
give rise to antitrust standing in this litigation, see Aluminum II, 95 F. Supp. 3d at 444; see also Aluminum I, 2014 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 121435, 2014 WL 4277510, at *23. It is thus far from clear that the second-level purchases on which defendants seize 
would play any role at trial, let alone be a basis for recovery. While these purchases do not raise a fundamental conflict, the 
need for individualized inquiries into whether various transactions were first- or second-level purchases is separately germane to 
the Rule 23(b)(3) predominance inquiry. It reinforces the Court's ruling, reviewed infra, that the FLPs cannot satisfy the 
predominance requirement."
319,37," Where the factual basis for a challenge to adequacy overlaps with a basis for a challenge to predominance, at least one court 
has been skeptical of a claim of ""fundamental"" conflicts. In Freeland v. AT&T Corp., 238 F.R.D. 130 (S.D.N.Y. 2006), defendants 
asserted that ""[t]he differences among the purported class members that make it impossible to satisfy the predominance 
inquiry [**117]  likewise underlie the fundamental conflicts."" Id. at 142. Judge Cote was not persuaded by this ""repackaging"" of a 
predominance challenge as also an adequacy problem. Id. But, while finding Rule 23(a)(4) satisfied, Judge Cote denied class 
certification under Rule 23(b)(3), finding that defendants had established that plaintiffs' claims ""are not susceptible to generalized 
proof."" Id. at 156. Ultimately, whether adequacy and predominance challenges to a proposed class can both be found 
meritorious based on the same factual circumstances turns on the specific circumstances. Notwithstanding the outcome in 
Freeland, no precedent precludes a court from denying class certification on both grounds based on overlapping facts. "
320,38," Compare Third Joint Ltr. at 6 & n.4 (excluding Alcoa, Rio Tinto, Rusal, Century, and Noranda from the proposed class, and 
arguing that a particular Hydro entity is not a smelter), with TAC ¶ 57 (alleging named plaintiff Custom paid ""the Midwest 
Premium on purchases from primary aluminum producers,"" including a Hydro entity), and Pl. Reply at 62 (listing ""Hydro"" as one 
of ""six major smelters producing aluminum for North American consumption""). "
321,39," See OA Tr. at 115 (""[I]f you are Trafigura in 2013, your concern is not that you might be excluded from the proposed class. 
Your concern is that you are going to be named as a defendant.""). Notably, of the 10 named plaintiffs that have brought suit in 
this MDL—the four FLPs and the six individual plaintiffs who have opted out in favor of individual lawsuits—all are industrial 
users. No trader, smelter, or warehouse owner elected to pursue such an action—even though they were among the largest 
purchasers in the putative class. "
322,40," To illustrate the point concretely: If a trader sold 10 units of aluminum during the class period and purchased five entirely 
different units, Hanover Shoe would bar defendants from defending on the ground that any overcharges on the five units had 
been passed along to the purchaser's downstream customers. But Hanover Shoe does not directly speak to whether any 
overcharges incurred on the five units could be netted against any gains on the 10 units that were sold, where, as here, 
defendants' challenged conduct—queue [**126]  formation at warehouses—was not itself part of the distribution chain. "
324,41," As reviewed above, the FLPs are incorrect that the Second Circuit held that plaintiffs in this MDL ""suffered antitrust injury 
based on [a] well-developed summary judgment record,"" Pl. Sur-Reply at 1. Whether the FLPs have adduced common proof to 
reliably establish classwide antitrust injury is a matter of first impression for this Court to resolve. See supra pp. 29-30."
324,42," See also Aluminum II, 95 F. Supp. 3d at 449 (""Moreover, despite the FLPs' allegations to the contrary, the conspiracy alleged 
is not a conspiracy to fix the price of physical aluminum—that is, 'x' amount per metric ton. The scheme is primarily aimed at 
increasing trading profits, which requires a necessary price impact—not a price fix. Variations in price may have as much or 
more benefit to participants in such a scheme as a price certain. A conspiracy to fix the price of aluminum would involve different 
players (for example, producers) in different markets.""). "
329,43," At argument, the FLPs' counsel cited the High-Tech Employee litigation, 985 F. Supp. 2d 1167, as the case that comes closest 
""to indicat[ing] that [documentary evidence] alone could get the plaintiff across the [predominance] goal line,"" while 
acknowledging that ""these cases are never done alone"" on lay evidence and that, in High-Tech Employee, ""there is [also] expert 
testimony."" OA Tr. at 25. For that reason, High-Tech Employee does not support the FLPs' bid to found class certification wholly 
on non-expert evidence. In any event, that case involved claims of a far simpler antitrust conspiracy. See, e.g., Intel, 2014 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 165261, 2014 WL 6601941, at *14 & n.11 (distinguishing High-Tech Employee as involving class allegations of a 
""conspiracy to suppress employee compensation through agreements to refrain from soliciting employees from co-defendants,"" 
for which the required expert analysis only ""superficially resemble[d]"" the more complicated ""two-step analysis"" undertaken by 
the Intel plaintiffs' expert to show classwide proof of impact and causation). Plaintiffs and their experts there thus had a far lighter 
lift in establishing classwide proof of impact than here. For these reasons, High-Tech Employee's dicta regarding the theoretical 
possibility that documentary evidence alone could establish classwide impact is not instructive here. "
330,44," As reviewed below, the second and third of these deficiencies implicate multiple steps of Dr. Gilbert's analysis. "
337,45," Moreover, there is offsetting evidence. An August 2019 book co-edited by Dr. Gilbert itself acknowledges that ""[t]he increase in 
premiums"" attributable to longer queues ""may not increase the overall price . . . if it simply reduces the portion of the price 
represented by the LME quotation."" First Playforth Decl., Ex. 7 at 112. Another FLP expert, Dr. Zona, conceded at his deposition 
that none of his analysis is inconsistent with the conclusion that queues depress LME prices. Zona Dep. at 312-13; see generally 
supra pp. 84-85."
337,46," Confronted in his deposition, Dr. Gilbert cited the potential for joint endogeneity—i.e., the possibility that the LME contango 
and LME prices each affect the other—as a reason not to include the spread variable in his Appendix E regressions. See Gilbert 
Dep. at 220-21; Hausman Decl. ¶¶ 52-53. But joint endogeneity is not a reason to omit an important variable from a model. Such 
is a ""fundamental econometric mistake because it will create an omitted variables problem."" Hausman Decl. ¶ 52 & n.57 (citing 
Jerry Hausman, Specification [**183]  and Estimation of Simultaneous Equation Models, in Handbook of Econometrics, vol. 1 
(Zvi Griliches and Michael Intriligator eds., 1983)). Rather, an ""instrumented"" version of the variable should be used to control for 
endogeneity. Id. Methods for testing for joint endogeneity, in particular the Hausman specification test, are well known and are "
338,," typically covered in undergraduate and graduate econometric textbooks. Id. ¶ 53. Here, to avoid concern regarding endogeneity, 
Dr. Hausman used an instrumented version of Dr. Gilbert's spread variable and applied the Hausman specification test to test for 
endogeneity. Id."
338,47," The defendants raise additional issues, including Dr. Gilbert's apparent failure, in his effort to split data into multiple time 
periods in his reply report, to implement the approach he claims to use—the Bai-Perron method. See Def. Sur-Reply at 13-14 & 
n.8. The Court primarily focuses on the failure to control for contango, which even Dr. Gilbert concedes is ""Dr. Hausman's most 
important criticism of my analysis of LME prices."" Gilbert Sur-Reply Rpt. ¶ 33. "
339,48," As with Dr. Hausman's re-running of the models relating queues to the LME price, the Court considers Hausman's analysis for 
its demonstration of methodological infirmities in Dr. Gilbert's model, not as an unimpeachable superior model. In any event, Dr. 
Hausman suggests that, had he started from scratch, rather than applied an improved version of Dr. Gilbert's methodology, the 
percentage of class members whose purchase price was unaffected may have been even higher. Hausman Reply Decl. ¶ 91 & 
n.92. "
340,49," Separately, the Court notes that, even if Dr. Gilbert's model had survived as viable common proof of classwide injury, to satisfy 
Rule 23(b)(3), purchases from smelters other than Alcoa, Rusal, and Rio Tinto would have to be excluded. That is because Dr. 
Gilbert's analysis relies on transaction data and contracts produced by, and purports to show antitrust impact for purchases from, 
those three smelters only. Dr. Gilbert did not have usable data or records of, and did not offer any analysis as to suppliers other 
than those three. Gilbert Reply Rpt. ¶¶ 43, 48 & nn.41, 45. The FLPs thereby have not come forward with a practical means of 
isolating first-level purchases from other smelters, let alone purchases that included the Midwest Premium as a price 
component. See Second Joint Ltr. at 4-9. "
341,50," Such analysis would be further complicated by the fact that although, in discovery, the FLPs obtained certain transaction data 
from three smelters and contracts that lay out the terms pursuant to which aluminum was purchased, they did not obtain 
information from Alcoa or Rio Tinto that ties specific transactions to specific contracts. See First Joint Ltr. at 10. Further 
compounding the process of identifying transactions within the class, an unknown but not-insignificant portion of the produced 
contracts do not appear to have been executed. Individualized inquiry could well prove necessary to establish which of these 
contracts were performed and, from among the hundreds of thousands of transactions in the produced data, which were carried 
out pursuant to contracts that included an MWP or MWTP term. "
342,51," The FLPs attempt to distinguish In re FX, among other cases defendants cite, as having applied the ""administrative feasibility"" 
test rejected by the Second Circuit in In re Petrobras Securities. Pl. Sur-Reply at 33-34. The FLPs misread both FX and 
Petrobras. As the Second Circuit explained in Petrobras, a court—independent of determining whether Rule 23(b)(3)'s 
predominance requirement is met—must determine whether the proposed class satisfies the distinct Rule 23 requirement of 
""ascertainability."" In re Petrobras Sec., 862 F.3d at 264 n.15. The Circuit clarified that—although other circuits had treated 
ascertainability as requiring a showing of ""administrative feasibility""—in the Second Circuit ascertainability ""requires only that a 
class be defined using objective criteria that establish a membership with definite boundaries."" Id. at 264. But, the Circuit 
explained, some of the inquiries that other circuits had treated as part of the administrative feasibility inquiry in fact were ""territory 
belonging to the predominance requirement."" Id. at 268 (citing Mazzei, 829 F.3d at 272). Following this guidance, in FX, Judge 
Schofield found the need for individual inquiries into whether trades were actionable or not to be [**200]  a fatal predominance 
issue. In re FX, 407 F. Supp. 3d at 431-35. The individualized inquiries here as to which purchases fell within the class definition 
similarly implicate the predominance requirement. "
343,52," Because common questions do not predominate, the Court has no occasion to resolve the separate Rule 23(b)(3) question of 
whether a class action would be a superior means of adjudication of these claims. "
350,1," ""Generic Version"" is defined as follows: [W]ith respect to the Combination Product or a Single Agent Product or Double Agent Product, a product containing the 
same active ingredients as the Combination Product or the Single Agent Product or Double Agent Product, as the case 
may be, with those being the only active pharmaceutical ingredients in such product, and which product is approved in the 
United States under an [ANDA]. Atripla Agmt. § 1.96. "
352,2," The Court also notes that Plaintiffs disagree as to what would be the proper means by which, e.g., BMS would have obtained 
approval of a FDC containing its brand drug and generic versions of Gilead's drugs. See Docket No. 383 (Pls.' Letter at 2) 
(asserting that, ""[a]s the continuing member, BMS could have switched API suppliers for TDF and FTC by filing a supplement to 
the NDA without needing to file an ANDA""). "
353,3," ""Substitutes are goods that can replace one another and thus 'compete' for the user's purchase"" whereas ""complements are 
goods that are most efficiently made or used together."" Areeda & Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law ¶ 565a. When two goods are in the same relevant market — that is, substitutes . . . - a price increase in one typically occasions a 
price increase in the other. For example, if coal and natural gas are in the same market, a reduction in coal output will 
increase the demand for natural gas, thus causing its price to increase, as well as the coal price. Indeed, the entire concept 
of a 'market' includes the notion that the prices of the goods in the market tend to be uniform, or to rise and fall together. In contrast, when goods are complements in demand, their prices tend to move in opposite directions. For example, 
gasoline and automobiles are complements, because a driver needs both. A significant output reduction and price increase 
in gasoline will cause less driving, which will reduce the demand for cars, causing a price decrease there. Id. "
354,4," Because of these and other allegations on price competition, the Court rejects Defendants' contention that it is necessarily 
inconsistent for Plaintiffs to claim both a broad cART product market and narrower brand drug/generic equivalent product 
markets. In other words, it is not inconsistent for Plaintiffs to argue that: (1) at competitive prices, a substitute for a brand drug 
would usually be only its generic equivalent (a narrow market), see FACC ¶ 372, but (2) there can still be some weak price 
competition among different brand drugs (the broader market). "
359,5," In 2001, Gilead began marketing TDF. See FACC ¶ 3. The approval date for TDF was October 26, 2001. See FACC ¶ 69."
359,6," If Gilead had not intentionally delayed its development/approval of TAF, then it would have obtained FDA approval of its first 
TAF-based product (Genvoya) in January 2010. See FACC ¶ 359. With Gilead's intentional delay, the FDA did not actually 
approve Genvoya until November 5, 2015. See FACC ¶ 69."
359,7,  
360,," To facilitate the approval of generic drugs as soon as patents allow, the Hatch-Waxman Amendments and FDA regulations 
direct brand manufacturers to file information about their patents. The statute mandates that a brand submit in its NDA ""the 
patent number and the expiration date of any patent which claims the drug for which the [brand] submitted the [NDA] or 
which claims a method of using such drug."" § 355(b)(1). And the regulations issued under that statute require that, once an 
NDA is approved, the brand provide a description of any method-of-use patent it holds. See 21 CFR §§ 
314.53(c)(2)(ii)(P)(3), (e) (2011). That description is known as a use code, and the brand submits it on FDA Form 3542. As 
later discussed, the FDA does not attempt to verify the accuracy of the use codes that brand manufacturers supply. It 
simply publishes the codes, along with the corresponding patent numbers and expiration dates, in a fat, brightly hued 
volume called the Orange Book (less colorfully but more officially denominated Approved Drug Products With 
Therapeutic [*51]  Equivalence Evaluations). Caraco Pharm. Labs., Ltd. v. Novo Nordisk A/S, 566 U.S. 399, 405-06, 132 S. Ct. 1670, 182 L. Ed. 2d 678 (2012). "
362,8," Due diligence is defined in § 156(d)(3) - ""that degree of attention, continuous directed effort, and timeliness as may reasonably 
be expected from, and are ordinarily exercised by, a person during a regulatory review period."" 35 U.S.C. § 156(d)(3). "
364,9," See generally Intel Corp. v. Fortress Investment Group LLC, No. C-19-7651 (N.D. Cal.) (Docket No. 190) (order on motion to 
dismiss)."
364,10," The Court acknowledges that the creation of a joint venture is, in fact, evaluated under the rule of reason. See Docket No. 273 
(Order at 17); see also Texaco Inc. v. Dagher, 547 U.S. 1, 6 n.1, 126 S. Ct. 1276, 164 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2006). However, no party 
seems to contest this point - i.e., this is not where Defendants are asking for the Court to make a determination. "
369,1," Defendants request the Court take judicial notice of California DMV records indicating Defendants were issued a used 
dealership license on April 25, 2019, one month before Plaintiff filed the complaint in this matter. (ECF No. 11-2.) The Court may 
take judicial notice of matters of public record without converting the motion into one for summary judgment. See Lee v. City of 
Los Angeles, 250 F.3d 668, 690 (9th Cir. 2001) (on a motion to dismiss, a court may take judicial notice of undisputed matters of 
public record); see also Mack v. South Bay Beer Distributors, 798 F.2d 1279, 1282 (9th Cir. 1986) (""a court may take judicial 
notice of records and reports of administrative bodies""); Shaghoian v. Aghajani, 228 F. Supp. 2d 1107, 1109 n. 4 (C.D. Cal. 
2002) (taking judicial notice of DMV records). Therefore, pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 201, the Court takes judicial 
notice of the records showing Defendants' licensing status."
369,2," Plaintiff's remedies under the UCL and FAL are limited to injunctive relief and restitution. Pom Wonderful LLC v. Welch Foods, 
Inc., No. CV 09-567 AHM (AGRx), 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 123329, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 123329, at *8 (C.D. Cal. Dec. 21, 
2009). Since Defendant has now obtained a California license, it is not clear what further injunctive remedy the Court could grant 
at this time. Furthermore, ""disgorgement of profits allegedly obtained by means of an unfair business practice"" is not ""an 
authorized remedy under the UCL where the profits are neither money taken from a plaintiff nor funds in which the plaintiff has 
an ownership interest."" Korea Supply Co. v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 29 Cal. 4th 1134, 1152, 131 Cal. Rptr. 2d 29, 63 P.3d 937 
(2003). The Court here grants leave to amend, but as pleaded, it appears unlikely Plaintiff will be able to state a colorable 
remedy for his UCL and FAL claims."
369,3," Defendants object to Plaintiff's attempt to supplement its Complaint with a declaration by its attorney as procedurally improper. 
See Vassel v. Carson Helicopters, Inc., No. 13-cv-02520, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 65727, 2014 WL 1912056, at *3-4 (E.D. Cal. 
May 13, 2014) (declining to consider plaintiff and attorney declarations submitted in opposition to a motion to dismiss where 
documents attached to the declarations were not the proper subject of judicial notice or incorporation by reference). Plaintiff 
offers no argument or legal authority to support a finding that the facts contained within the declaration are the proper subjects of 
judicial notice. Accordingly, the Court declines to consider Plaintiff's declarations in support of its opposition. "

380,*," The Honorable Michael R. Murphy, United States Circuit Judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, sitting by 
designation."
380,1," Defendants use other terms like ""therapeutic pet food"" and ""veterinarian recommended"" to describe this kind of food, but for 
consistency with Plaintiffs' second amended complaint, we use the term ""prescription pet food."""
380,2," In a separately filed memorandum disposition, we affirm the district court's dismissal of Plaintiffs' claim that Defendants violated 
Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1. "
381,3," We use ""Mars"" to describe Mars and Royal Canin collectively because Royal Canin is a subsidiary affiliate of Mars, and 
Plaintiffs allege that ""[s]ome combination of Royal Canin and Mars manufacturers, produces, [and] markets . . . Royal Canin 
'Veterinary Diet,'"" one of the products at issue."
381,4," The Final CPG is published at 81 Fed.Reg. 26,236-01. "
383,5," Four of the six Plaintiffs purchased Hill's prescription pet food while the other two purchased Mars prescription pet food. Thus, 
Purina is not named as a defendant on these California state law counts."
383,6," As noted above, Defendants also moved to dismiss the Sherman Act antitrust claim, which the court granted. See note 1, 
supra. "
384,7," Because the cause of action under each California state law is premised on the same allegedly misleading acts in this case—
i.e., misrepresentation of the certification of and ingredients in prescription pet food—we evaluate the UCL, FAL, and CLRA 
claims collectively, as did the district court and all parties. "
385,8," Defendants' argument—that the individual Plaintiffs lacked exposure to the term ""prescription pet food"" prior to receiving a 
written prescription from their vets—impacts the standing analysis, but not the reasonable consumer analysis. See Reid, 780 
F.3d at 958 (""[T]he reasonable consumer standard, unlike the individual reliance requirement[,] . . . is not a standing 
requirement.""). We analyze standing separately. See infra at 20-23."
385,9," The Illinois law ""protect[s] consumers . . . against fraud, unfair methods of competition, and other unfair and deceptive 
practices."" Vanzant, 934 F.3d at 736 (quotations omitted). The California UCL targets deceptive, unfair and unlawful business 
practices, see Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200, so it is broader but also encompasses acts targeted by the Illinois statute. "
386,10," Although ""[c]ompliance with FDA regulations may be relevant to a preemption argument,"" Williams, 552 F.3d at 940 n.4, 
Defendants do not make such an argument here."
386,11," Rule 9(b) requirements may not even be necessary, given that a defendant can violate the UCL, FAL, and CLRA by acting 
with mere negligence. See Williams, 552 F.3d at 938 (applying a ""reasonable consumer"" test to UCL, FAL, and CLRA claims); 
Chamberlan v. Ford Motor Co., 369 F. Supp. 2d 1138, 1144 (N.D. Cal. 2005) (rejecting arguments that plaintiffs must show 
intent to deceive for CLRA and UCL claims); Khan v. Med. Bd., 12 Cal. App. 4th 1834, 16 Cal. Rptr. 2d 385, 392 (Ct. App. 1993) 
(holding that FAL ""can be violated through negligence""). Thus, because ""fraud is not a required element, Rule 9(b)'s heightened 
pleading standard [may] not apply."" See Vanzant, 934 F.3d at 739; Belville v. Ford Motor Co., 60 F. Supp. 3d 690, 698 (S.D. W. 
Va. 2014) (agreeing that because ""most state consumer protection laws do not require the same elements of proof as common-
law fraud, . . . . a state-by-state analysis"" is necessary to determine whether Rule 9(b) applies); see also Wright & Miller, 5A Fed. 
Prac. & Proc. Civ. § 1297 (4th ed.) (""Some federal or state statutes may define fraud in a manner that eliminates one or more of 
the[] [traditional] elements of a fraud claim . . . .""). Nonetheless, Plaintiffs did not raise this argument in their briefing, so we do 
not decide this issue at this stage. "
387,12," California voters passed Proposition 64 in 2004, ""which restricts standing for individuals alleging UCL and FAL claims to 
persons who 'have suffered injury in fact . . . .'"" Hinojos, 718 F.3d at 1103 (citing Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code §§ 17204, 17535) 
(brackets removed). "
388,13," We also reject Defendants' additional arguments about the relief that Plaintiffs seek. First, Defendants' assertion that Plaintiffs 
have no standing for injunctive relief is foreclosed under our recent case, Davidson, in which we held that ""a previously deceived 
consumer may have standing to seek an injunction against false advertising or labeling, even though the consumer now knows 
or suspects that the advertising was false at the time of the original purchase."" 889 F.3d at 969. HN18[
] There is sufficient 
cognizable injury where Plaintiffs allege that they cannot rely on Defendants' labeling of a product when deciding whether to 
purchase it in the future. Id. at 970-71. Second, Defendants' argument that Plaintiffs cannot seek equitable relief under the UCL 
or FAL, given an adequate legal remedy under the CLRA, is foreclosed by statute. HN19[
] The UCL, FAL and CLRA explicitly 
provide that remedies under each act are cumulative to each other. See Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code §§ 17205, 17534.5; Cal. Civ. 
Code § 1752. Last, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs do not have standing to enjoin all of Defendant Manufacturers' prescription 
pet food products because Plaintiffs have not purchased every single type of prescription pet food available from Hill's or Mars. 
This does not constitute a basis for dismissal because Plaintiffs' challenge to prescription pet foods is to the common scheme of 
the prescription requirement and prescription-based advertising. Cf. In re Tobacco II Cases, 207 P.3d at 40-41 (holding class 
representatives had standing to challenge common marketing of cigarettes despite differences in the advertisements or 
statements on which class members relied). "
389,1," Use of the term ""violations"" is not really accurate because, as the majority acknowledges, the FDA has never initiated any 
enforcement action against Defendants. "
390,2," Plaintiffs made no specific allegations of ""unfair"" or ""fraudulent"" business practices in their complaint."
390,3, The advertising provisions of California's Unfair Competition Law overlap with the False Advertising Law. 
392,4, This was the same language used by the FDA in the Policy Guide upon which Plaintiffs rely in their complaint.
392,5," This claim is remarkably similar to Plaintiffs' claims predicated on use of the term ""prescription."""

Defendants in response to the allegations. "

award up to double the amount required to compensate for the injury, 46 U.S.C. § 41305(b) to (c), prejudgment interest, 46 
C.F.R. § 502.253, and reasonable attorney fees, 46 C.F.R. § 502.254. The Shipping Act limits an award of ""reparations"" for an injury caused by a violation of the statute to complaints filed within three 
years from the date the relevant claim accrues, 46 U.S.C. § 41301(a), and the regulations echo that limitation, 46 C.F.R. §

517,4," We cannot agree with our dissenting brother's position that the first prong of Cohen is absent. Respectfully, we believe that the 
district court has conclusively determined a disputed question. The district court expressly held ""that SmileDirect's Sherman Act 
antitrust claim, as pleaded, is sufficient to survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss on Parker immunity grounds[.]"" Dist. Ct. Op. 
at 13. And the district court's dispositive order expressly denied the Board members' motion to dismiss that claim. Id. at 16 "
518,," (""Defendants' Motion to Dismiss . . . is DENIED with respect to the claims in Counts II—IV [Count II being the antitrust claim] 
against the Board member defendants.""). Thus, the district court rejected the Board members' legal arguments that they were 
entitled to state-action immunity as a matter of law. That the district court acknowledged the fact that the ultimate determination 
of the Board members' entitlement to immunity would have to await ""further factual developments"" later in the litigation does not 
nullify the district court's holding that SmileDirect's claim, as pleaded, survives the immunity defense. See Commuter Transp., 
801 F.2d at 1289 (holding that a summary judgment decision rejecting a claim of state-action immunity ""is 'conclusive' even if it 
is based on the existence of potential fact issues""). As noted in the text, binding precedent in Diverse Power and Commuter Transportation holds that state-action immunity is 
immunity from suit—not merely immunity from liability. There is established law detailing the significance of immunity from suit, 
as distinguished from immunity from liability. HN3[
] As the Supreme Court said in Behrens v. Pelletier: Harlow and Mitchell make clear that the defense is meant to give government officials a right, not merely to avoid ""standing 
trial,"" but also to avoid the burdens of ""such pretrial matters as discovery . . . , as 'inquiries of this kind can be 
peculiarly [**9]  disruptive of effective government.'"" Mitchell, supra, at 526 (emphasis added) (quoting from Harlow, supra, 
at 817). Whether or not a later summary judgment motion is granted, denial of a motion to dismiss is conclusive as to this 
right. . . . [T]his right is important enough to support an immediate appeal."
518,516," U.S. 299, 308, 116 S. Ct. 834, 133 L. Ed. 2d 773 (1996); see also Brown v. Crawford Cty., Ga., 960 F.2d 1002, 1011 (11th 
Cir. 1992) (noting the significance of immunity from suit, we held: ""[t]o preserve its purpose, 'entitlement to absolute immunity 
must be determined as early as possible' and appropriately on a motion to dismiss or judgment on the pleadings"") (quoting from 
Marx v. Gumbinner, 855 F.2d 783, 788 (11th Cir. 1988)). Thus, if the Board members' legal arguments at this early stage had been sound, they would have been entitled to dismissal 
now, without having to engage in discovery and further litigation. After a litigant's immunity defense is denied at an early stage, 
the caselaw recognizes that the facts may change after further factual development, and at a later stage in the litigation, the 
party may assert again its immunity defense. See Behrens, 516 U.S. at 309, 116 S. Ct. at 840 (""[R]esolution of the immunity 
question may require more than one judiciously timed appeal, because the legally relevant factors bearing upon the Harlow 
question will be different on summary judgment than on an earlier motion to dismiss."") (internal quotation omitted). We also disagree with the dissent's suggestion that our decision is merely a hypothetical, advisory opinion. Although it is true 
that our decision does not resolve the issue of the Board members' ultimate entitlement to state-action immunity, our decision 
does definitively resolve the legal issues the Board members have presented at this stage. Our decision does definitively reject 
two legal arguments asserted by the Board members: First, their argument that they are entitled to ipso facto immunity merely 
because the Governor approved the Board's rule under Georgia's statutory framework that vests in the Governor the power, 
authority, and duty to substantively review, approve, modify, or veto the rule, notwithstanding whether the Governor has actually 
exercised his powers and discharged his duties; and second, their argument that the ""active supervision"" prong (of the 
applicable analysis where the board is dominated by market participants) is satisfied because of the Governor's approval of the 
rule in light of that statutory framework, again notwithstanding whether the Governor has actually exercised his statutory powers 
and discharged his duties. "
519,5," The parties in Dental Examiners and the Court assumed that the clear articulation requirement of Midcal was satisfied. 574 
U.S. at 504. "
521,6," Of course, upon the initiation of discovery, the Board members may be able to produce evidence of Governor Deal's 
substantive consideration of the proposed amendment. Our comments on the Board's compliance with the Midcal test only 
applies to the facts which we assume in this Rule 12(b)(6) posture. "
522,7," Neither the Supreme Court, Ronwin, 466 U.S. at 568 n.17, nor the Eleventh Circuit has decided whether the executive action of 
a governor could qualify for state action immunity under appropriate factual circumstances. We need not address that issue 
today."
522,8," SmileDirect makes a forceful argument that the Georgia legislation delegates the rule-making authority to the Board, and 
intended only to give the Governor sufficient authority to satisfy Midcal's active supervision prong. In light of our decision today, 
we need not decide the scope of the authority actually delegated to the Governor. "
524,9," We decline to address other arguments of the parties not addressed in this opinion, the resolution of which is not necessary for 
us to conclude at this stage of the litigation that the district court correctly denied the Board members' motion to dismiss. "
526,1," We also have jurisdiction over certain interlocutory orders that the district court has specifically certified for appeal, where ""such 
order involves a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and . . . an immediate 
appeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation."" 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b). Tellingly, the 
District Court here denied the Board members' request to certify its order for interlocutory appeal under § 1292(b). "
527,2," The majority points to the last page of the District Court's opinion, which states ""Defendants' Motion to Dismiss . . . is DENIED"" 
with respect to the antitrust claim in Count II. See id. at 7-8 n.4 (quoting Dist. Ct. Op. at 16). But, based on the District Court's 
analysis, it is clear that that order refers to the District Court's conclusion that, as an initial matter, SmileDirect adequately stated 
an antitrust claim—i.e., that the complaint sufficiently alleged concerted action to unreasonably restrain trade. See Dist. Ct. Op. 
at 10-11. Its denial of the Board members' motion to dismiss has nothing to do with the Board members' affirmative defense, 
which is a separate question. That the District Court's denial of the Board members' motion to dismiss relates only to whether 
SmileDirect stated an antitrust claim—as opposed to the sufficiency of the Board members' affirmative defense—makes sense, 
since the sole purpose of Rule 12(b)(6) is to assess whether the complaint has sufficiently stated a claim for relief."
527,3," I can't understand why SmileDirect chose to include this allegation in its complaint. It certainly wasn't necessary to state an 
antitrust claim under the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1. See, e.g., Quality Auto Painting Ctr. of Roselle, Inc. v. State Farm Indem. 
Co., 917 F.3d 1249, 1260 (11th Cir. 2019) (en banc) (""[Section] 1 prohibits (1) conspiracies that (2) unreasonably (3) restrain 
interstate or foreign trade.""). As the District Court observed, SmileDirect's complaint sufficiently alleged that the Board members 
engaged in concerted action to unreasonably restrain trade as required to state an antitrust claim, without regard to the 
Certification of Active Supervision. See Dist. Ct. Op. at 10-11. The only apparent purpose of this paragraph is to preemptively 
negate the Board members' anticipated defense of Parker immunity. But it is of course black-letter law that a plaintiff need not 
negate defenses in its complaint in order to survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. See, e.g., Isaiah v. JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, 960 F.3d 1296, 1304 (11th Cir. 2020) (""A complaint need not anticipate and negate affirmative defenses and should not 
ordinarily be dismissed based on an affirmative defense unless the defense is apparent on the face of the complaint."" (citing 
Bingham v. Thomas, 654 F.3d 1171, 1175 (11th Cir. 2011))). In fact, by including a reference to the Certification in its complaint, 
SmileDirect handed the Board members the very allegation to support their argument that the defense of state-action immunity 
was apparent on the face of the complaint. "
528,4," In support of our finding that we had collateral-order jurisdiction, we cited Commuter Transportation Systems, Inc. v. 
Hillsborough County Aviation Authority, 801 F.2d 1286 (11th Cir. 1986). In Commuter Transportation Systems, we determined 
that we had collateral-order jurisdiction to review the District Court's denial of summary judgment based on state-action 
immunity, because such immunity is an immunity from suit rather than a mere defense to liability. Id. at 1289-90. In so doing, we 
concluded that the District Court's denial of summary judgment ""finally and conclusively determined"" the disputed question—""the 
defendant's claim of right not to stand trial on the plaintiff's allegations""—because ""[t]here are simply no further steps that can be 
taken in the district court to avoid the trial the defendant maintains is barred."" Id. at 1289 (quoting Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 
511, 527, 105 S. Ct. 2806, 2816, 86 L. Ed. 2d 411 (1985)). We also noted that the District Court's denial came ""[a]fter four years 
and nine months of discovery, including extensive interrogatories, production of thousands of pages of [the defendant's] records, 
and seventeen depositions."" Id. at 1288. Of course, that is not the case here. As explained in Part II, there is nothing preventing 
the District Court from deciding on summary judgment, after the close of discovery on the relevant Parker-immunity facts, that 
the Board members are entitled to state-action immunity. At that stage, the District Court could render a conclusive 
determination on state-action immunity by construing the relevant facts in the light most favorable to SmileDirect—thereby 
eliminating any fact issue—and deciding whether, as a matter of law, the Board members are entitled to the immunity defense. 
Unlike in Commuter Transportation Systems, then, the Board members here have one more opportunity to convince the District 
Court at this next step of the litigation that they are entitled to immunity from suit and should not have to stand trial on 
SmileDirect's Sherman Act claims. Thus, their entitlement to state-action immunity—and their right not to stand trial—have not 
yet been conclusively determined. "
529,5," It's worth noting that, had SmileDirect not included the allegation regarding the Certification of Active Supervision in its 
complaint, this is precisely what would have happened. The Board members, lacking any argument that the allegations in the 
complaint show that they are entitled to state-action immunity, would have been forced to file an answer including that 
argument—and the facts supporting that argument—as a defense."
529,6," If the District Court denied immunity at this stage of the litigation, we could have collateral-order jurisdiction. That's because, 
after discovery has closed and all of the relevant Parker-immunity facts have been made available to the District Court, the 
District Court, in ruling on summary judgment, will construe all of the relevant facts in the light most favorable to SmileDirect, the 
non-movant. By thus eliminating any fact issue, the District Court will render a final legal determination on whether the Board 
members are entitled, as a matter of law, to state-action immunity. We would have collateral-order jurisdiction to review that final 
legal determination on appeal. "
530,," Theoretically, the District Court could have gone through this exercise at the motion-to-dismiss stage. It could have construed all 
of the facts alleged at this stage in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, SmileDirect, and decided whether, accepting the facts 
as alleged by SmileDirect, the Board members are nonetheless entitled to state-action immunity. Only then, after having 
eliminated any fact issue, could the District Court have rendered a final legal determination on state-action immunity that would 
be reviewable on appeal under Cohen. Of course, the District Court here did not do this. Rather, it noted that the fact issues 
were not resolvable at the motion-to-dismiss stage, and so it deferred any final determination of the immunity issue for resolution 
at the summary-judgment stage. (Truthfully, the Board members should be thankful that the District Court did not definitively rule 
on the state-action-immunity defense based only on the facts in the complaint. If it did, and conclusively determined that the 
Board members were not entitled to state-action immunity, that would be the end of the matter. The Board members could not 
re-raise the issue at the summary judgment stage.) Of course, even at the summary-judgment stage, we will not necessarily have collateral-order jurisdiction to review the District 
Court's decision. For example, if the District Court does not eliminate the fact issues by leaning the facts one way or the other, 
and instead finds that genuine factual issues preclude granting summary judgment to the Board members, we would not have 
collateral-order jurisdiction on appeal. Cf. Johnson v. Jones, 515 U.S. 304, 313, 115 S. Ct. 2151, 2156, 132 L. Ed. 2d 238 (1995) 
(holding that the District Court's determination that the summary judgment record raised a genuine issue of fact—i.e., of 
""evidence sufficiency""—concerning the defendants' entitlement to qualified immunity was not a ""final decision"" that was 
immediately appealable); cf. also Plumhoff v. Rickard, 572 U.S. 765, 773, 134 S. Ct. 2012, 2019, 188 L. Ed. 2d 1056 (2014) 
(distinguishing Johnson on the ground that the defendant-petitioners in Plumhoff [**43]  ""raise[d] legal issues; these issues are 
quite different from any purely factual issues that the trial court might confront if the case were tried""). "
531,7," In its decision on the merits, the majority, like the District Court, cites Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. 
Ed. 2d 868 (2009), and Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007), for the standard 
governing our analysis of the Board members' motion to dismiss. See ante at 10. But it then jumps straight into an analysis of 
state-action immunity. Id. In doing so, the majority's opinion would seem to require that a plaintiff, in order to adequately plead an 
antitrust violation under the Sherman Act, allege facts showing the absence of state action. See id. at 10-11. But a plaintiff need 
not plead the absence of state action as part of the cause of action to state a federal antitrust claim; state-action immunity is a 
defense that must be pleaded and proved by the defendant seeking its protection. So, the real question in this case is whether 
the defendant Board members have met  [**46] their burden to show that they are entitled to this defense at the motion-to-
dismiss stage. Cf. id. at 13 (finding that ""the Board members have failed to satisfy the Midcal test"" for state-action immunity); id. 
at 18 (""[T]he Board has not satisfied the active supervision requirement for entitlement to state-action immunity.""); id. at 25 
(""[T]he Board members have fallen far short of establishing that the amended rule was 'in reality' the action of the Governor""). It's 
an odd question to answer, because the only pleading we have so far is the plaintiff's complaint. That's why when we are faced 
with a motion to dismiss a complaint based on a defense, we ask whether the defense appears on the face of the plaintiff's 
complaint. E.g., Bingham, 654 F.3d at 1175 (citing Jones v. Bock, 549 U.S. 199, 215, 127 S. Ct. 910, 921, 166 L. Ed. 2d 798 
(2007)). In other words, we must ask whether the plaintiff's allegations adequately support the defendant's claims. In my view, the best way to conceptualize this awkward exercise is to treat the defendant's motion as if it were an answer under 
Rule 8, which asserts the affirmative defense of state-action immunity and includes the relevant facts from the plaintiff's 
complaint (and no more). The motion to dismiss would then be treated as a motion for judgment on the pleadings under Rule 
12(c). Based on the defendant's ""answer,"" we would ask whether, viewing all the alleged facts in the light most favorable to the 
non-movant (the plaintiff), the defendant has sufficiently shown its entitlement to an affirmative defense, and thus dismissal of 
the complaint. So, in this case, we would imagine that the Board members had filed an answer asserting the affirmative defense 
of state-action immunity, which included only a single factual allegation along the lines of paragraph 45 of SmileDirect's 
complaint—i.e., the Certification of Active Supervision. The issue to be resolved, then, is whether the Board members have 
shown—based only on the facts alleged in their hypothetical answer—that they are entitled to the affirmative defense. Working 
through the analysis in this way ensures that we do not place the burden on the wrong party. "
542,1," Defendant's counsel argued at the July 15, 2020 hearing that because Defendant's position is that the Restrictive Covenants 
should be read as a single non-competition agreement, taken as a whole, the Restrictive Covenants prohibit more than mere 
copying, thereby taking Plaintiff's claim out of copyright preemption. However, Defendant argued that if the Court were to 
construe each subsection of the Restrictive Covenants as separate, standalone covenants, then a discussion of copyright 
preemption was necessary. "
547,2," Although the Court strikes this provision as unreasonable and unenforceable, the Court determines, in its discretion, for the

558,8," Although Rule 23(a)(4) by its express terms deals only with the adequacy of the ""representative parties,"" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) 
(4) (emphasis added), the Supreme Court noted in Amchem [*28]  Products, Inc. that the adequacy requirement ""also factors in 
competency and conflicts of class counsel,"" 521 U.S. at 626 n.20 (emphasis added). Accordingly, several courts have addressed 
the adequacy of class representatives and class counsel in tandem. See, e.g., London v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 340 F.3d 1246, "
559,1253," (11th Cir. 2003) (noting that the Rule 23(a) (4) adequacy requirement ""applies to both the named plaintiff and counsel"" 
(quoting Amchem Prods., Inc., 521 U.S. at 626 n.20)). In 2003, however, Congress enacted Rule 23(g), which outlines factors 
for courts to consider in assessing the adequacy of class counsel. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(g) advisory committee's note to 2003 
amendment (""Until now, courts have scrutinized proposed class counsel as well as the class representative under Rule 
23(a)(4).""); accord Bell v. Brockett, 922 F.3d 502, 510 (4th Cir. 2019). Accordingly, I will address separately the adequacy of 
class counsel pursuant to Rule 23 (g) below."
559,9," Although Craft notes that the same data can be obtained from pharmacies and TPPs, id. ¶¶ 5, 15, her methodology relies on 
PBM data as the primary data source, see id. ¶ 21; Buchman Reply Decl. Ex. 3 (""Craft Rebuttal Decl.""), ¶ 10 (ECF Nos. 886-4 
(public), 885-3 (sealed)) (""There is no need to rely on pharmacy data in this case given the proposed Class consists solely of 
TPPs who themselves have records of their Zetia/ezetimibe purchases and who hire PBMs as their claims adjudication agents 
who retain detailed, accurate, and comprehensive data."")."
559,10," According to Defendants, the court cannot take judicial notice of the declarations filed in other cases. Defs.' Mot. Certify Hr'g 
Ascertainability Presentation (""Defs.' Ascertainability Presentation"") 15 (ECF Nos. 1020 (sealed), 1021-2 (public)) (citing Lee v. 
City of Los Angeles, 250 F.3d 668, 690 (9th Cir. 2001)). As a preliminary matter, the language that Defendants quote from Lee - 
""With respect to Plaintiff's citation to a declaration in another case, documents filed in other cases are of no assistance to 
Plaintiff, as the Court cannot take judicial notice of the truth of facts set forth in filings in other cases"" - does not appear 
anywhere in that opinion. Moreover, in Lee, a case with no binding effect on this court, the Ninth Circuit found that a district court 
erred in taking judicial notice of disputed facts on a motion to dismiss. See 250 F.3d at 688-89. Here, Defendants do not dispute 
the factual assertions in the PBM declarations; rather, they argue that those assertions do not lend support to EPPs' 
ascertainability arguments. See Defs.' Ascertainability Presentation 15. Accordingly, Lee is inapposite. In any event, Defendants 
do not dispute that the court may properly consider the declaration of Steven Schaper, Caremark L.L.C.'s senior vice president "
560,," of employer sales, submitted specifically for the present litigation, ECF No. 939-5, which largely mirrors the other PBM 
declarations."
560,11," To the extent any data field or variable name is ambiguous, however, ""a simple 'data dictionary' (a record maintained by 
virtually all companies deploying large data-intensive technology systems) provides clarification and allows the data to be 
standardized."" Craft Decl. ¶ 7. "
561,12," EPPs note that the proposed class members are PBM clients and that there is no reason to suspect that PBMs would be 
hostile to their efforts to obtain a recovery, see July Hr'g Tr. 130:9-22, particularly since the sought data relates only to TPPs and 
thus does not implicate personal identifying information of consumers, see Craft Rebuttal Decl. ¶ 11."
561,13," See, e.g., Mahoney v. Endo Health Sols., Inc., No. 15-cv-9841 (S.D.N.Y Nov. 21, 2016), ECF No. 97, at 3; In re Relafen 
Antitrust Litig., No. 01-cv-12239, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29834, at *17-19 (D. Mass. Nov. 24, 2004)."
561,14," By contrast, Dietz testified that he lacks expertise in computer hardware, computer software, storage systems, and data 
aggregation. May Hr'g Tr. 131:18-132:6. "
562,15," Fully-insured plans are those plans that purchase a group health insurance policy from a third-party insurer that ""assumes 
financial responsibility for the covered health benefit claims of the plan's participants and the associated administrative costs."" 
Craft Decl. ¶ 33. In such circumstances, the insurer, rather than the plan sponsor, is considered the TPP for purposes of the 
class exclusion. Id.; accord May Hr'g Tr. 102:1-13. "
563,16," Two other points also bear mention here. First, the Niaspan court noted its concern that the methodology proposed by Craft 
""would be prohibitively expensive,"" citing evidence from another pay-for-delay case out of Massachusetts that obtaining the 
relevant pharmaceutical records would cost $18 million. See 464 F. Supp. 3d 678, 2020 WL 2933824, at *19. In this case, 
however, there has been no showing regarding the cost of obtaining PBM data; therefore, that factor does not inform this 
report's analysis. Second, the court in Niaspan, according to EPPs' counsel, did not hear live testimony from Craft but instead 
relied, in part, on a four-and-a-half-page report authored by Craft. July Hr'g Tr. 124:4-23. In this case, Craft prepared exhaustive 
and detailed reports totaling nearly sixty pages. And her live testimony demonstrated not only her extensive knowledge and 
experience regarding PBM data, but also that she has the analytical tools to carry out, in an administratively feasible way, what 
she proposes. "
564,17," Of the eight exclusions, three involved consumers. Id. at *4. The other five resemble exclusions in EPPs' amended class 
definition. See id. (defendants, certain government entities, entities that purchased the drug directly from defendants or for 
purposes of resale, fully-insured plans, and certain PBMs)."
564,18," Defendants do not contest EPPs' ability to identify entities encompassed by the other exclusions, namely (1) PBMs, which are 
easily identifiable, and, according to Craft, do not fall within the class definition to begin with; (2) Defendants and their affiliates, 
which can be identified by Defendants; and (3) entities that made direct purchases or purchased ezetimibe for purposes of 
resale, which can be identified using Defendants' own data. See Craft Decl. ¶¶ 30, 35-38. "
568,19," Dr. Hughes' calculation of 100,000 uninjured class members in this category is confounding in other respects. He appears to 
have derived this estimate by multiplying the percentage of plans that stopped filing Form 5500s after May 2015 (approximately 
5 percent) by the total number of Form 5500s filed during the entire class period (about 2.2 million). See Hughes Presentation 7. 
Because plans filed multiple Form 5500s during the class period, this calculation is meaningless and thus irrelevant to the 
question of uninjured class members. "
569,20," The issue of brand-loyal consumers neatly illustrates the difference between injury-in-fact and damages. A brand-loyal 
consumer never sustains antitrust injury because they would not have bought generic no matter when it entered the market. See 
Asacol, 907 F.3d at 53-54; Niaspan,464 F. Supp. 3d 678, 2020 WL 2933824, at *26. In those cases that rejected certification on 
this ground, it was not sufficient for the end payors to simply produce classwide proof that permitted them to accurately estimate 
brand retention and then remove such purchases from their aggregate damages model. Absent classwide proof of which 
consumers were brand loyalists, those classes potentially included large numbers of claimants who suffered no antitrust injury at 
all and thus could not demonstrate impact. By contrast, institutional payors like those in the EPP class in this case can easily 
show impact given their volume of affected transactions. "
572,21," Dr. Lamb's estimate of the rebate percentage was based on Merck's data relating to rebates that it actually paid. Lamb Suppl. 
Decl. ¶ 4 (citing Hughes Presentation 5); July Hr'g Tr. 13:10-24. "
575,22," Because EPPs' claims sound in tort rather than breach of contract, I look to the applicable choice-of-law rules governing tort 
claims. See Restasis, 335 F.R.D. 1, 2020 WL 2555556, at *30 (considering similar state claims in pharmaceutical antirust end-
payor action as tort claims for choice-of-law analysis); In re Relafen Antitrust Litig., 221 F.R.D. 260, 277-79 (D. Mass. 2004) 
(same); Buchanan v. Doe, 246 Va. 67, 71, 431 S.E.2d 289, 291, 9 Va. Law Rep. 1446 (1993) (defining ""tort"" in Virginia as ""any 
civil wrong or injury; a wrongful act""); see also Wellbutrin XL, 282 F.R.D. at 135 (""[A]ntitrust violations are essentially tortious 
acts."" (quoting Associated Gen. Contractors v. Cal. State Council of Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 547, 103 S. Ct. 897, 74 L. Ed. 2d 
723 (1983) (Marshall, J., dissenting))). "
576,23," Although it is not addressed by either side, this report also follows Restasis' reasonable approach to mail-order prescriptions 
and ""treat [s] the place of receipt of mailed drugs as the place of purchase."" 335 F.R.D. 1, 2020 WL 2555556, at *31."
576,24," See also FTC v. Cement Inst., 333 U.S. 683, 694, 68 S. Ct. 793, 92 L. Ed. 1010, 44 F.T.C. 1460 (1948) (observing that ""all 
conduct violative of the Sherman Act may likewise come within the unfair trade practice prohibitions of the Trade Commission 
Act"")."
576,25," Indeed, courts often remark about such similarities. See, e.g., Restasis, 335 F.R.D. 1, 2020 WL 2555556, at *8 n.8; Relafen, 
221 F.R.D. at 275 278. "
577,26," Furthermore, courts have recognized the extensive similarities among various state unjust enrichment laws. See In re 
Suboxone (Buprenorphine Hydrochloride & Naloxone) Antitrust Litig.# 64 F. Supp. 3d 665, 703 (E.D. Pa. 2014) (""While it is true 
that the elements of unjust enrichment vary state by state, ""almost all states at minimum require plaintiffs to allege that they 
conferred a benefit or enrichment upon defendant and that it would be inequitable or unjust for defendant to accept and retain 
the benefit.'"" (quoting In re Flonase, 692 F. Supp. 2d 524, 541 (E.D. Pa. 2010))); see also Flonase, 284 F.R.D. at 219 & n.11 
(noting similarities of unjust enrichment laws and observing that the plaintiffs ""will utilize the same operative evidence to 
establish"" liability despite minor differences)."
577,27," EPPs assert unjust enrichment claims under the laws of twenty-six jurisdictions. Of those jurisdictions, there are only two - 
Alabama and Vermont - whose laws do not also provide the basis for antitrust or consumer protection claims. See Zetia, 2019 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 59469, 2019 WL 1397228, at *39 (Exs. A, B). Defendants have not pointed to anything in the unjust enrichment 
laws of Alabama or Vermont that would defeat predominance as to class members seeking to recover for purchases in those 
two states. "
586,1," Although Defendant emphasizes that the proposed market definition is ""even narrower"" with the exclusion of short-acting 
ACTH, Defendant does not appear to dispute that short-acting ACTH drugs are reasonably excluded from the relevant market. 
See Mot. at 6 (addressing why Plaintiff must allege indication-based markets and acknowledging Plaintiff's allegation that ""short-
acting ACTH drugs are not included in the relevant market 'because there is no overlap in the medical conditions that the drugs 
are approved to treat or diagnose'"" (citing SAC ¶ 52 n.6)); id. at 11-12 (""Only for those indications for which Synacthen proves 
effective and safe could it even be considered a possible potential new entrant, as Humana admits when excluding from its 
proposed market definition 'short-acting ACTH drugs.'""). "
588,2," Defendant contends that ""the fact that 'Sabril may be used in combination with long-acting ACTH drugs' (SAC ¶ 49 n.3) creates 
no fact issue as to whether it is not an alternative but a complementary product, like software is to hardware."" Dkt. 78 (Reply) at 
2 n.1 (citing Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law § 565a (4th ed. 2020)). Defendant does not explain why this 
is so. Further, at this stage, Plaintiff need not create a fact issue. All factual allegations are accepted as true."
588,3," That Defendant glossed over the import of these new allegations is evident by Defendant's incorrect claim that Plaintiff 
""attempts to justify the[] exclusion [of other drugs] based solely on its allegation that 'the drugs exhibit a very low degree of 
cross-price elasticity.'"" Reply at 1. "
589,4," Defendant contends the March Order rejected the factual premise that Defendant was able to raise its price without losing 
sales. Reply at 1 (citing March Order at 11). But all the Court held was that none of the allegations in the FAC supported that 
claim. Plaintiff has now added such allegations."
589,5," The Court therefore need not, and does not, address Plaintiff's additional allegations in support of direct proof of market power. "
590,6," Plaintiff asserts the cases cited by Defendant address antitrust cases brought by competitors and not consumers, for which 
there are different burdens. Opp'n at 10-11. However, the circuit courts to have considered the issue have concluded that both 
consumers and competitors must satisfy the intent and preparedness test. See, e.g., Meijer, Inc. v. Biovail Corp., 533 F.3d 857, 
862, 382 U.S. App. D.C. 385 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (""Just as a would-be entrant suing an incumbent firm for excluding it from a 
relevant market in violation of the Sherman Act must demonstrate it intended and was prepared to enter that market, . . . so a 
would-be purchaser suing an incumbent monopolist for excluding a potential competitor from which it might have bought a 
product at a lower price must prove the excluded firm was willing and able to supply it but for the incumbent firm's exclusionary 
conduct"" (internal citations omitted)); Sunbeam Television Corp. v. Nielsen Media Research, Inc., 711 F.3d 1264, 1273 (11th Cir. 
2013) (following Meijer and rejecting position that ""proof of a 'willing and able' competitor 'standing in the wings, ready to swoop 
in' should only apply to competitor plaintiffs, not customer plaintiffs.""). "
591,7," Plaintiff agrees that these 22 states have limitations periods of four or fewer years for antitrust claims, but contends that for two 
of those states, New York and Oregon, the antitrust claim was statutorily tolled ""for one year after the conclusion of any 
proceeding instituted by the United States under federal antitrust laws."" Opp'n at 19. Defendant appears to concede that these 
are not time-barred. See Reply at 6 n.3. Therefore, the parties agree that 20 of 25 states relevant to Plaintiff's state antitrust 
claim are subject to a statute of limitations defense. "
592,8," The Court grants Plaintiff's unopposed request for judicial notice (Dkt. 70) of a press release issued by Defendant in June 2013. 
Fed. R. Evid. 201(b)."
592,9," Plaintiff's footnote implicitly arguing that the Court should find fraudulent concealment here because of the Court's conclusion 
as to Plaintiff's RICO claim, Opp'n at 15 n.20 (citing March Order at 25), is misplaced. The facts necessary to put Plaintiff on 
inquiry notice of the RICO claims differs materially from the types of facts that would put Plaintiff on inquiry notice of the antitrust 
claims."
592,10," The Court grants Plaintiff's unopposed request for judicial notice (Dkt. 70) of Defendant's SEC filings and the license 
agreement with Novartis (Dkts. 70-1, 70-3 through 70-8). Fed. R. Evid. 201(b). "
593,11," It does not appear that Defendant disputes that the complaints filed on October 30, 2017 and December 8, 2017 would toll the 
statute of limitations for claims based on conduct that occurred within four years of those dates. "
594,12," The Court also held that Plaintiff had not adequately alleged any racketeering activity based on alleged insured 
misrepresentations or the theory that co-pay assistance was bribery. March Order at 26-28. The Court invited Plaintiff to amend 
those claims to the extent it wished to continue pursuing them. Id. at 35 n.21. Because Plaintiff chose not to amend those claims, 
it has abandoned them. For the sake of clarity, the Fourth and Fifth Counts, to the extent they rely on either of these theories, 
are DISMISSED."
594,13," Defendant concedes it is not entitled to dismissal based on the allegations in the SAC alone. See Mot. at 19 (Defendant 
""agrees that [Plaintiff] had not pled admissions on the critical issue of what it knew about the CDF funds at the time"")."
594,14," Defendant contends that its argument is not that the articles themselves should have put Plaintiff on notice, but that the OIG's 
2014 SAB, which purportedly singled out the emergence of single-drug funds, should have caused Plaintiff to run some Google 
searches to see if there were any articles about drugs covered by Plaintiff. Reply at 11. Whether Plaintiff's investigation (or lack 
thereof) in response to the 2014 SAB was reasonable is a factual issue not best resolved at the motion to dismiss stage. "
596,15," In half a sentence Plaintiff contends that members' acceptance of co-pay assistance is alternatively ""'disruption' of the 
contractual relationship."" Opp'n at 21 (citing Redfearn v. Trader Joe's Co., 20 Cal. App. 5th 989, 230 Cal. Rptr. 3d 98, 104 
(2018)). This is insufficient to preserve this argument. See Birdsong v. Apple, Inc., 590 F.3d 955, 959 (9th Cir. 2009) (HN13[
] 
""[A] bare assertion does not preserve a claim, particularly when, as here, a host of other issues are presented for review.""); see 
also Indep. Towers of Washington v. Washington, 350 F.3d 925, 929-30 (9th Cir. 2003) (""However much we may importune 
lawyers to be brief and to get to the point, we have never suggested that they skip the substance of their argument in order to do 
so. . . . We require contentions to be accompanied by reasons.""); Mahaffey v. Ramos, 588 F.3d 1142, 1146 (7th Cir. 2009)

608,1, Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein have the meanings provided in the Stipulation (as defined below). 
638,1," The regulatory scheme employed by the FDA is governed by the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. § 301 et 
seq., as amended by the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (the ""Hatch-Waxman Act""), and the 
Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, 21 U.S.C. §§ 355(b)(2) and 355(j) and 35 
U.S.C. § 271(e). "
639,2," The Amended Complaint does not specify precisely when the restrictive distribution contracts were executed or when they 
expire, but does allege they are still in effect."
639,3," The WAC is the publicly available list price for drugs published by the industry. Astrazeneca AB v. Apotex Corp., 985 F. Supp. 
2d 452, 468 n.12 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) "
640,4," Recently, on October 25, 2019, following receipt of several discovery requests from the FTC, Vyera paid RL Fine to terminate 
their agreement. "
641,5," The Phoenixus board of directors controls Vyera, which does not have a board of directors."
641,6, The FTC's antitrust claims are brought pursuant to the FTC Act. The states bring their federal claims under the Sherman Act. 
644,7, The defendants have not argued that the state antitrust claims may be dismissed if the federal antitrust claims survive. 
645,8," See Astrazeneca AB, 985 F. Supp. 2d. at 502-03 (describing the gradual decline in prices that occurs when multiple generic 
competitors, over time, enter a market previously occupied by a single branded drug). "
646,9," The defendants also argue that Vyera's exclusive supply contract with Fukuzyu is not harmful to competition because its term 
was set at a limited number of years. A fact-finder will assess the anti-competitive effect of this and the other Vyera contracts at 
a later stage of this litigation. The Fukuzyu contract, however, includes an automatic annual renewal term and remains in place 
today. In any event, that contract was just one facet of the overarching scheme and there is no requirement that a scheme to 
thwart competition run beyond a particular number of months or years to be actionable. "
647,10," The defendants note that between 2014 and 2019, three generic competitors filed ANDA applications. Section 1 forbids a 
conspiracy to restrain competition even where that conspiracy is not completely successful. "
648,11," The court in Anadarko held that the Commonwealth could not allege that the defendants' joint venture and market sharing 
agreements violated the UTPCPL because the conduct did not meet the statutory definition of the catchall provision. 206 A.3d at 
61. The court determined that other claims, which alleged ""disingenuous and misleading behavior,"" were viable under the 
UTPCPL because they did meet this statutory definition. Id. at 62 The decision permitting those claims to survive is being 
reviewed on appeal. Commonwealth v. Chesapeake Energy Corp., 218 A.3d 1205 (Pa. 2019) (per curiam)."
648,12," The Pennsylvania Attorney General also may promulgate definitions of the terms ""unfair methods of competition"" and ""unfair 
or deceptive acts or practices"" through administrative rulemaking. 73 Pa. Stat. Ann. § 201-3.1. The court in Anadarko noted that 
the Pennsylvania Attorney General, like the Pennsylvania General Assembly, has declined to expand the definition of these 
terms to cover the full panoply of conduct deemed unlawful under the federal antitrust laws. 206 A.3d at 60-61. "
649,13," While the plaintiffs argue that they have pleaded ""constructive fraud,"" they do not explain how the conduct at issue qualifies as 
constructive fraud, nor do they provide any authority suggesting that the reference to fraudulent conduct in the catchall provision 
of the UTPCPL should be interpreted to encompass constructive fraud. "
652,1," The following facts are drawn from Plaintiff's Amended Complaint (Doc. No. 40 (""FAC"")). "
654,2," Like other drug manufacturers, Mallinckrodt set the wholesale acquisition cost (""WAC"") for Acthar and then charged a 25% 
markup. (Id. at ¶ 209). As such, the AWP is 25% above the WAC."
654,3," According to Plaintiffs, TPPs determine reimbursement payments for prescriptions based on the AWPs reported by 
pharmaceutical industry publications. (Id. at ¶ 242). Further, Plaintiff alleges that Mallinckrodt was supplying ""false"" AWPs to 
these publications in an effort to manipulate the price actually paid by TPPs. (Id. at ¶¶ 242-45). However, Plaintiff also seems to 
assert that it and other TPPs actually paid the inflated AWP set by Mallinckrodt for Acthar. (Id. ¶ 229). Consequently, it is unclear 
what was ""false"" about the AWPs reported by Mallinckrodt to the industry publications. "
656,4," While the existence of these settlement agreements cannot be used to prove the validity of Plaintiff's claims, there is no need to 
strike them from the Amended Complaint as Mallinckrodt urges the Court to do. See Goode v. LexisNexis Risk & Info. Analytics 
Grp., Inc., 284 F.R.D. 238, 243 (E.D. Pa. 2012) (explaining that ""[r]elief under Rule 12(f) is generally disfavored and will be 
denied unless the allegations have no possible relation to the controversy and may cause prejudice to one of the parties, or if the 
allegations confuse the issues in the case"" (internal quotations omitted)). "
660,5," Hypothetically, if the Court were to grant the motions to strike and then grant the initial motions to dismiss, such dismissal 
would almost surely be without prejudice. As a result, Plaintiff would be able to file an amended complaint anyway. Therefore, no 
one really has anything to gain by striking the Amended Complaint and adjudicating the initial Motions to Dismiss as opposed to 
proceeding to simply adjudicate the Motions to Dismiss the Amended Complaint. The Court notes that Plaintiff has failed to file opposition briefs to Mallinckrodt and Express Scripts' Motions to Dismiss the 
Amended Complaint. As many months have gone by, the Court assumes that Plaintiff has no interest in doing so. Nevertheless, 
because Mallinckrodt and Express Scripts' Motions to Dismiss the Amended Complaint are virtually identical to their initial 
Motions to Dismiss, the Court will treat Plaintiff's Opposition briefs to those motions as if they were in response to the later filed 
motions. "
662,6," Like Sherman Act Section 2, NJAA Section 56:9-4(a) prohibits three distinct types of conduct—monopolization, attempted 
monopolization, and conspiracy to monopolize. Neither the Amended Complaint nor Plaintiff's briefing explicitly states which of 
these theories Plaintiff is pursuing. However, Plaintiff's heavy reliance on the City of Rockford case, where the plaintiffs 
apparently only pursued a conspiracy to monopolize theory, 360 F. Supp. 3d at 755-56, leads the Court to assume that Plaintiff 
is similarly only pursuing a conspiracy theory. If Plaintiff wishes to pursue a monopolization and/or attempted monopolization 
theory, it must attempt to amend its Amended Complaint to make that desire clear. "
664,7," For claims concerning exclusive distributorship arrangements, the analysis of Section 56:9-3's ""anticompetitive effects"" 
requirement is essentially the same as for Section 56:9-4(a)'s ""overt acts"" requirement. City of Rockford, 360 F. Supp. 3d at 756. 
But reader beware—sometimes the analysis for these requirements can be quite different. "
665,8," Plaintiff may protest that even if Express Scripts did not directly refuse to deal with new entrants, the exclusive dealing 
relationship may still have induced it to cooperate in Mallinckrodt's illegal marketing scheme for Acthar. However, the Supreme 
Court has held that even when firms implement a vertical restraint in order to perpetrate an illegal fraud, the restraint cannot be 
condemned under antitrust law unless the plaintiff shows harm to competition. See NYNEX Corp. v. Discon, Inc., 525 U.S. 128, 
137-138, 119 S. Ct. 493, 142 L. Ed. 2d 510 (1998) (finding that plaintiff still needed to show anticompetitive harm from vertical 
boycott even though said boycott was part of an attempt to defraud a regulatory agency). "
668,9," Express Scripts does not cite In re Avandia in any of its briefing, instead relying on Maio and district court decisions issued 
before In re Avandia came down. Express Scripts' failure to address this clearly relevant Third Circuit precedent is troubling."
668,10," Plaintiff relies on In re Insulin Pricing Litigation, which found that the artificial inflation of a drug's AWP by its manufacturer 
could constitute mail fraud or wire fraud. No. 17-699, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25185, 2019 WL 643709, at *5 (D.N.J. Feb. 15, 
2019). However, in that case the plaintiffs alleged that the defendant manufacturers were secretly offering substantial discounts 
to certain distributors, meaning that the published AWPs were inaccurate. 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25185, [WL] at *3. Plaintiff 
makes no comparable allegation here."
668,11," Plaintiff alleges that it only paid $26,100.28 for the dose of Acthar that it purchased in 2018, which does conflict with Trudeau's 
representations of Acthar's price. (Id. at ¶ 29). But on each occasion, Trudeau added the caveat that Mallinckrodt offers "
669,," discounts to payors. (Id. at ¶¶ 233, 238). While Plaintiff asserts that this was itself a misrepresentation, as it claims that 
Mallinckrodt does not offer any discounts to TPPs, (id. at ¶ 234), the fact that Plaintiff paid only $26,100.28 means that it must 
have received some sort discount, given that Plaintiff repeatedly alleges that Acthar was genuinely priced at over $40,000 in 
2018. (FAC at ¶¶ 37, 232, 234, 553)."
669,12," Plaintiff does provide some more specific allegations concerning Mallinckrodt's relationship with certain KOLs, but even in 
these instances it fails to identify what the specific misrepresentations were. For example, Plaintiff alleges that Mallinckrodt 
provided funding to a Dr. James A. Tumlin to conduct and publish studies on the use of Acthar to treat non-FDA-approved 
indications, but Plaintiff does not explain what specific false representations Dr. Tumlin may have made. (FAC at ¶¶ 317-33)."
669,13," Notably, in Humana Inc. v. Mallinckrodt ARD LLC, yet another Acthar antitrust/RICO case, the court found that a TPP had 
adequately pleaded predicate acts of wire fraud and mail fraud for its federal RICO claim against Mallinckrodt relating to its 
marketing of Acthar. No. 19-6926, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 101378, 2020 WL 3041309, at *12 (C.D. Cal. Mar. 9, 2020). Most 
saliently, the Humana plaintiff alleged that: (1) there was a set of doctors who received substantial sums from Mallinckrodt to 
promote Acthar; (2) these doctors knew that this remuneration violated federal law; and (3) when obtaining authorization to 
prescribe Acthar from TPPs, including the plaintiff, these doctors affirmatively represented that they were not violating state or 
federal law. Id.; First Amended Complaint, Humana Inc. v. Mallinckrodt ARD LLC., No. 19-6926, at ¶¶ 30, 117-18 (C.D. Cal. Oct. 
2, 2019) (Doc. No. 46). Plaintiff's Amended Complaint hints at similar conduct, but perhaps due to the Amended Complaint's 
extreme lack of organization, this theory of misrepresentation never clearly coalesces. If Plaintiff wishes to pursue such a theory, 
it must attempt to amend its complaint. "
670,14," Plaintiff's Amended Complaint indicates that it is bringing a claim for ""conspiracy/aiding and abetting,"" but its briefing only 
discusses conspiracy, rather than the separate claim of aiding in the commission of a tort. (Doc. No. 44 at 37-38; Doc. No. 45 
36-37). Therefore, the Court assumes that Plaintiff is only attempting to bring a civil conspiracy claim. "
683,1," HN6[
] The First Amendment of the United States Constitution is applicable to the Virgin Islands pursuant to section 3 of the Revised Organic Act. See 48 U.S.C. § 1561 (“The following provisions of and amendments to the Constitution of the United 
States are hereby extended to the Virgin Islands to the extent that they have not been previously extended to that territory and 
shall have the same force and effect there as in the United States or in any State of the United States … the first to ninth 
amendments inclusive … .”)."
683,2," In his reply, Hailey asserts that “Respondents have waived their right to bring a defense under the First Amendment as no First 
Amendment issue was raised by Respondents in the courts of North Carolina.” (Reply Br. 4.) However, as we explain above, the 
issue of whether the North Carolina judgments unconstitutionally violate the First Amendment goes to the question of subject 
matter jurisdiction, in that judgments violative of the First Amendment are void, and the Superior Court cannot order enforcement 
of a void judgment. Consequently, the issue may be raised by the respondents or this Court sua sponte at any stage of the 
proceeding. In re Guardianship of Smith, 54 V.I. 517, 527 (V.I. 2010). "
685,3," Although the Supreme Court of Colorado has recently held that the protections of the Petition Clause of the First Amendment 
only extend to lawsuits implicating matters of public concern, and therefore do not extend to lawsuits arising from purely private 
disputes, see Gen. Steel Domestic Sales, LLC v. Bacheller, 291 P.3d 1, as modified (Colo. 2012), and Boyer v. Health Grades, 
Inc., 359 P.3d 25 (Colo. 2015), we find the court's reasoning unpersuasive. HN10[
] While the Supreme Court of the United 
States in Borough of Duryea, Pa. v. Guarnieri, 564 U.S. 379, 131 S. Ct. 2488, 180 L. Ed. 2d 408 (2011), held that lawsuits filed 
by government employees against their government employer are only entitled to Petition Clause immunity if they involve 
matters of public concern, the Court specifically noted that “[o]utside the public employment context, constitutional protection for 
petitions does not necessarily turn on whether those petitions relate to a matter of public concern.” Id. at 394. Additionally, as 
Justice Scalia explained in his separate opinion: “The text of the Petition Clause does not distinguish petitions of public concern 
from petitions of private concern. Accordingly, there should be no doctrinal distinction between them unless the history or 
tradition of the Petition Clause justifies it.” Id. at 406 (Scalia, J., concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part). 
Moreover, analysis of the history of the Petition Clause around the time of the founding reveals that petitions to the government 
constituted a primary and criminal mechanism for the resolution of private disputes. Indeed, “[t]he primary responsibility of 
colonial assemblies was the settlement of private disputes raised by petitions.” Id. at 404 (citing Higginson, A Short History of the 
Right to Petition Government for the Redress of Grievances, 96 Yale L.J. 142, 145 (1986))."
685,4," The correctness of the decision of the North Carolina Court of Appeals to not enforce the April 4, 2014 judgment in North 
Carolina is not an issue in this case. Hailey nevertheless asserts in his mandamus petition that “[a]fter the N.C. Court of Appeals' 
decision, procedural rules were promulgated in the Virgin Islands to create an automatic transfer of matters filed in Small Claims 
Court where an attorney enters an appearance on an individual defendant's behalf,” Pet. 3; that “the reality is that, at least 
partially as a result of the underlying N.C. case … this Court amended the V.I. Small Claims Rules to better protect the public's 
due process right to an attorney by setting forth rules reflective of that important right,” Pet. 4; and that “[t]he fact that the Rules 
had to be promulgated to address this issue supports Hailey's position that there was no formal method in place to protect the 
due process right to counsel in the Small Claims Division.” (Pet. 4.) Based on his apparent belief that he was the cause of the 
adoption of the Virgin Islands Small Claims Rules, Hailey urges that he should not be “label[ed] … as an unwelcome foreign 
intermeddler in local affairs.” (Pet. 4.) Hailey is greatly mistaken in his belief that this Court enacted rules directly in response to the North Carolina litigation. Prior to 
the effective date of Act No. 7888 on July 30, 2016, this Court lacked the statutory authority to promulgate rules for the Superior 
Court. Although Act No. 7888 provided for the Supreme Court to “adopt rules governing civil and criminal procedure, evidence … 
and the practice and procedure in the courts of the judicial branch,” 4 V.I.C. § 32(f)(1), it also authorized the Chief Justice to 
appoint a committee to study the rules of procedure and recommend the adoption of new court rules. 4 V.I.C. § 32(f)(2). Shortly 
thereafter, on August 19, 2016, the Chief Justice exercised this authority by establishing the Advisory Committee on Rules. See 
In re Establishment of an Advisory Committee on Rules, S. Ct. Prom. No. 2016-0007, 2016 V.I. Supreme LEXIS 45, [WL] (V.I. 
Aug. 19, 2016). Since its establishment, the Advisory Committee has drafted and recommended for adoption by this Court the 
Virgin Islands Rules of Civil Procedure, the Virgin Islands Rules of Evidence, the Virgin Islands Rules of Criminal Procedure, the 
Virgin Islands Habeas Corpus Rules, the Virgin Islands Small Claims Rules, the Virgin Islands Rules for Probate and Fiduciary 
Proceedings, the Virgin Islands Rules of Family Division Procedure, and the Virgin Islands Traffic Rules. While the Virgin Islands 
Small Claims Rules were enacted after the North Carolina Court of Appeals issued its February 15, 2017 opinion, their 
promulgation was not in response to that decision, but rather part of a multi-year rules revision project that had commenced 
nearly a year beforehand. Likewise, Hailey is incorrect that individuals were ever systematically denied the opportunity to be represented by counsel when 
sued in the Small Claims Division. Prior to the assumption of appellate jurisdiction by this Court on January 29, 2007, appeals 
from decisions of the Superior Court were taken to the United States District Court of the Virgin Islands. See Hypolite v. People, 
51 V.I. 97, 101 (V.I. 2009). In one of our earliest decisions, this Court held that its creation “did not erase pre-existing case law,” 
and that decisions of the District Court acting in an appellate capacity remained “binding upon the Superior Court” unless and 
until this Court held otherwise. In re People of the V.I., 51 V.I. 374, 389 n.9 (V.I. 2009). More than four decades ago, the District 
Court, sitting in its appellate capacity, recognized that depriving a small claims defendant of the right to be represented by "
686,," counsel violated the constitutional right to due process, and held that a matter filed in the Small Claims Division should be 
transferred to the Civil Division whenever counsel is retained or even just requested. Carr v. Pena, 432 F. Supp. 828 (D.V.I. 
1977). The Carr precedent has been followed as binding precedent in the Virgin Islands, and even prior to the adoption of the 
Small Claims Rules, cases filed in the Small Claims Division were routinely transferred if counsel was retained or requested or if 
a jury trial was demanded. See, e.g., Carbana Ensemble Theater Co. v. V.I. Dept. of Human Service, ST-2012-SM-414, 2012 
V.I. LEXIS 74, *1, [WL], at *1 (V.I. Super. Ct., Oct. 16, 2012); Inter Ocean Insurance Agency v. Joseph, SX-2006-CV-177, 2011 
V.I. LEXIS 90, *2, [WL], at *1 (V.I. Super. Ct., Sept. 28, 2011); Horton v. Gov't of the V.I., SX-2010-SM-17, 2010 V.I. LEXIS 110, 
*2, [WL], at *2 (V.I. Super. Ct. June 17, 2010);  McCarthy v. Monte, ST-1990-CV-63, 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10029, *4, [WL] at *2 
(D.V.I., June 17, 1991); Regan v. Estate Questa Verde Townhouses, 24 V.I. 46, 47, [WL], at *1 (V.I. Super. Ct. 1988); Watlington 
v. Thompson, SX-1982-CV-715, 1983 V.I. LEXIS 66, *2, [WL]at *1 (V.I. Super. Ct. Jan. 24, 1983). In fact, the Reporter's Note 
accompanying Rule 2 of the Virgin Islands Small Claims Rules expressly states that the provision requiring transfer when an 
attorney is requested or enters an appearance or if a jury trial is demanded is not a new requirement, but only codifies the Carr 
precedent."
686,5," In his reply, Hailey states that “[t]he Judgments are not violative of Respondents' right to petition under the First Amendment 
because, among other things, Respondents violated V.I. law when obtaining the Default Judgment in [the Small Claims Division] 
against Hailey.” (Reply Br. 3-4.). However, because Hailey neither moved to set aside the April 4, 2014 judgment nor filed a 
notice of appeal, the judgment remains valid and in effect in the Virgin Islands. HN12[
] In any case, the Supreme Court of the United States has made clear that even unsuccessful lawsuits are protected by the Petition Clause of the First Amendment. BE 
& K Construction Co., 536 U.S. at 532."
686,6," As noted earlier, Hailey also asserts in his mandamus petition that he has a clear and indisputable right to a ruling on his 
reconsideration motion and maintains that the Nominal Respondent's failure to rule constitutes a “conscious decision to not 
exercise jurisdiction.” (Pet. 14.) However, because the Nominal Respondent does in fact lack jurisdiction to take any action with 
respect to the void North Carolina judgments other than issuing an order dismissing Hailey's petition for lack of jurisdiction, we 
conclude that Hailey does not have a clear and indisputable right to have the Nominal Respondent rule on his reconsideration 
motion on the merits. In any event, we are confident that the Nominal Respondent will issue a formal ruling consistent with the 
holding of this opinion."
686,7," In his reply, Hailey argues for the first time that the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Constitution — which is 
applicable to the Virgin Islands through section 3 of the Revised Organic Act — mandates that the Virgin Islands enforce the two 
North Carolina judgments. Because Hailey only argued in his mandamus petition that he is entitled to enforcement under the 
UEFJA and raises his Full Faith and Credit Clause argument for the first time in his reply brief, the issue is waived. See 
Benjamin v. AIG Ins. Co. of Puerto Rico, 56 V.I. 558, 567 (V.I. 2012) HN13[
] (“When an argument is raised for the first time on 
appeal in a reply brief, that argument is deemed waived because the appellee will not get an opportunity to respond to the 
argument.” (citations omitted)). We note, however, that it is well-established that the Full Faith and Credit Clause — like the 
UEFJA — does not compel recognition or enforcement of void or illegal foreign judgments. See, e.g., World-Wide Volkswagen 
Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U.S. 286, 291, 100 S. Ct. 559, 62 L. Ed. 2d 490 (1980); Vaughn v. Love, 324 Pa. 276, 284, 188 A. 299 
(1936); Hochstein v. James W. Hill Co., 76 N.H. 293, 82 A. 171, 173 (1912). "
687,8," Because we conclude that Hailey does not have a clear and indisputable right to the relief requested, we need not consider 
whether issuance of a writ would be appropriate under the circumstances. "

720,8," American Pipe tolling typically ends when a district court denies class certification, and the statute of limitations therefore runs 
during the pendency of an appeal of the class certification determination. See Menominee Indian Tribe of Wis., 614 F.3d at 527. 
Here, defendants agreed to exclude from future statutes of limitations calculations for claims previously tolled by the pendency of 
the class action the time between the district court's 2017 order denying class certification, MDL I—D.D.C. 2017 Op., 292 F.

722,9," Anheuser-Busch plaintiffs join the arguments raised in support of American Pipe tolling in the opposition briefs of omnibus

Partial Dismissal Am. Compl. (""Anheuser-Busch Pls.' Opp'n"") at 8 n.5, ECF No. 306 (first citing Pls.' Omnibus Opp'n; and then 
citing Kawasaki & Yang Ming Pls.' Opp'n). "
723,10," NYK plaintiffs overread language in Crown stating that ""the 'class complaint notifies the defendants not only of the substantive 
claims being brought against them, but also of the number and generic identities of the potential plaintiffs who may participate in 
the judgment'"" to argue that the class complaint is the exclusive source of notice for American Pipe purposes. NYK Pls.' Opp'n at 
9 (supplying emphasis and quoting Crown, 462 U.S. at 353). The quoted language simply indicates that notice may be provided 
by ""a class complaint,"" without restricting tolling to what is said in that complaint, and neither Crown nor any other binding 
decision indicates that a class complaint supersedes later representations by plaintiffs in class proceedings. Crown, 462 U.S. at 
353. "
724,11," As explained infra Part III.D.3, the goals of American Pipe are served by tolling claims for relief that post-date the class period 
brought by former putative class members whose allegations with respect to conduct mirror the claims of the putative class. 
Requiring such plaintiffs to bring separate, timely actions only for damages during the pendency of the class litigation would 
result in the ""needless multiplicity of actions,"" Crown, 462 U.S. at 351, American Pipe tolling is meant to avoid. "
730,12," Similarly, omnibus plaintiffs' claim that courts in this District ""steadfastly follow[] the dictates of Continental Ore at the pleading 
stage,"" Pls.' Omnibus Opp'n at 13, is unpersuasive. The cases cited apply the logic of Continental Ore when considering 
whether plaintiffs' allegations are adequately pled under Twombly, Jung v. Ass'n of Am. Med. Colls., 300 F. Supp. 2d 119, 157, 
160 (D.D.C. 2004), or the earlier, more permissive pleading rule of Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 78 S. Ct. 99, 2 L. Ed. 2d 80 
(1957), In re Consumer Credit Counseling Servs. Antitrust Litig., Nos. MDL 97MS233 (RMU), 97-CV-1741, 1997 U.S. Dist.

These are different inquiries, more amenable to the holistic approach encouraged by Continental Ore, than the American Pipe 
analysis. "
732,13," Plaintiffs counter that the Class Complaint alleged a conspiracy to impose rate-based fuel surcharges that continued until ""'at 
least' June 30, 2007"" and thereby provided notice to defendants that the putative class alleged a continuing conspiracy that, 
without more, is presumed to have continued even to the present and encompasses claims outside the class period. See Pls.' 
Omnibus Opp'n at 15 (quoting Class Compl. ¶ 1); NYK Pls.' Opp'n at 9-12; Kawasaki & Yang Ming Pls.' Opp'n at 7-12. Plaintiffs' 
argument is foreclosed by the determination that the class for which certification was sought in MDL I is the controlling class for 
American Pipe purposes. "
733,14," In arguing that the December 31, 2008 end of the class period sets a bound on the purchases of rail freight services for which 
plaintiffs may seek relief, defendants rely on three cases in which courts declined to toll claims brought by plaintiffs for purchases 
made outside the class period. See Defs.' Consol. Reply at 12-13, 13 n.14; Defs.' NYK Reply at 9-10; Defs.' Kawasaki & Yang 
Ming Mem. at 9. Those case are inapposite. In two of the cases, plaintiffs alleged no purchases during the class period and 
therefore were never members of the putative class, unlike plaintiffs here. See In re LIBOR-Based Fin. Instruments Antitrust 
Litig., 27 F. Supp. 3d 447, 486 (S.D.N.Y. 2014); Mass. Bricklayers & Masons Funds v. Deutsche Alt-A Sec., 273 F.R.D. 363, 366 
(E.D.N.Y. 2011). In the third case, the court denied tolling for purchases outside the class period because ""[t]he facts underlying 
. . . plaintiffs' claims based on purchases [after the class period] are entirely different from the facts underlying plaintiffs' claims 
based on purchases during the class period."" In re Linerboard Antitrust Litig., 504 F. Supp. 2d at 48. The theme of all three 
cases is that the timing of a discrete purchase alone is not dispositive. Rather, courts scrutinize the context and content of 
allegations concerning purchases outside the class period to determine whether defendants were on notice of the underlying 
allegations, just as they do when applying American Pipe to other potentially tolled claims."
733,15," Defendants further argue that plaintiffs' ""lingering effects"" allegations are untimely because they do not meet the requirements 
of ""the well-established 'continuing violations' doctrine,"" another exception to the Clayton Act's statute of limitations. Defs.' NYK 
Reply at 12; see also Defs.' AM Mem. at 16 (""AM must plausibly allege an 'injurious' or 'overt' act during the four-year limitations 
period.""). The continuing violations doctrine holds that the Clayton Act's statute of limitations period restarts each time a 
defendant commits an overt act in furtherance of ""a continuing conspiracy to violate the antitrust laws"" that results in injury to 
plaintiffs. Zenith Radio Corp., 401 U.S. at 338. This argument, however, holds no weight because plaintiffs' ""lingering effects"" 
allegations are tolled under American Pipe."
733,16," Plaintiffs' suggestion that claims outside the class period are tolled ""so long as the claims are based on the same legal theory 
and are alleged against the same defendants,"" Pls.' Omnibus Opp'n at 15 (citing Renati, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 185486, 2019 
WL 5536206, at *13); NYK Pls.' Opp'n at 14 (same), overshoots the mark. A factual, not just a legal, nexus is required. "
735,17," In the absence of American Pipe tolling, NYK plaintiffs attempt to save their post-2008 allegations by arguing that they ""relate 
back"" to the Class Complaint within the meaning of Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(d), see NYK Pls.' Opp'n at 17-19, which allows a party to 
file supplemental pleadings raising untimely, novel allegations ""setting out any transaction, occurrence, or event that happened 
after the date of the pleading to be supplemented,"" Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(d). NYK plaintiffs' complaint in this MDL is not a 
""supplemental pleading"" in relation to the Class Complaint, but rather the beginning of a new and distinct lawsuit. NYK plaintiffs 
therefore cannot claim the protection of Rule 15(d) for their untimely claims. The substantially similar argument raised by 
Kawasaki and Yang Ming plaintiffs, see [*141]  Kawasaki & Yang Ming Pls.' Opp'n at 16-17, fails for the same reason. "
736,18," Defendants further rely on Supreme Auto Transport, LLC v. Arcelor Mittal USA, Inc., 902 F.3d 735 (7th Cir. 2018), and Angel 
v. Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., No. 18-cv-01142, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 36022, 2019 WL 1060805 (D.D.C. Mar. 6, 
2019), in both of which the courts dismissed complaints as time-barred, denying those plaintiffs the benefit of American Pipe 
tolling. See Defs.' AM Mem. at 9-10; Defs.' NYK Mem. at 8-9. The complaints found untimely in these cases are not at all 
analogous to the instant complaints. The plaintiff class in Supreme Auto dramatically altered the identity and composition of the 
putative class from a class of direct purchasers of steel mill outputs, 902 F.3d at 739, to a class of indirect purchasers, including 
consumer purchasers, id. at 742. The new suit thus introduced ""substantial prejudice to defendants,"" who received no notice of 
claims of this breadth from the original litigation. Id. Likewise, the Angel court declined to toll the statute of limitations under 
American Pipe for untimely claims brought by a former putative class member who named as the primary defendants individuals 
who were not parties to the previous class action and who conceded that his claims were ""markedly different"" from those of in 
the original case. Angel, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 36022, 2019 WL 1060805, at *6. In both cases, the new action was so distinct in 
kind that the original suit could not have provided defendants with fair notice of any of the claims against them. Here, in contrast, 
despite the addition of some new factual allegations, the crux of the challenged complaints and the allegations of the putative 
class are the same: the alleged conspiracy among defendants to drive the adoption of the AIILF, a fuel-exclusive cost-escalation 
index that would allow them to use fuel surcharges as a means to increase overall rates. "
759,1," EMV technology is a global standard for credit cards that uses computer chips and chip readers to authenticate (and secure) 
chip-card transactions. (See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 65, 67.) It allows for secure transmittance of ""dynamic"" card information by creating 
a unique electronic signature for each transaction. (Id.) Prior to the adoption of EMV technology, payment cards relied entirely on 
magnetic stripes, which can only communicate ""static"" information such as the card number and expiration date. (Id. ¶¶ 63, 65.)"
759,2," Plaintiffs allege that had Defendants not conspired to impose the Liability Shift at the same time, at least one Defendant would 
have offered more lenient terms such as no ""Liability Shift component, an exten[sion of the] Liability Shift date, a break on fees, 
equipment or other more favorable terms."" (Am. Compl. ¶ 9.) They allege that ""[i]n a truly competitive environment, at least one 
of these entities would or should have broken ranks and offered merchants a break on any number of terms."" (Id.) "
760,3," American Express joins in sections I and III of Mastercard, Visa, and Discover's opposition regarding Plaintiffs' failure to meet 
Rule 23(b)(3)'s predominance requirement, and also offers two separate reasons why Plaintiffs' renewed motion should be 
denied as to American Express. (AmEx Opp'n 1.)"
760,4," The Amended Complaint named the following additional Defendants: Bank of America, N.A., Capital One Financial 
Corporation, Chase Bank USA, National Association, Citibank (South Dakota), N.A., Citibankn, N.A., PNC Bank, National 
Association, U.S. Bank National Association, and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (collectively, the ""Issuing Banks""), and EMVCo. (Am. 
Compl.)"
760,5," Discover and the Issuing Banks, together with EMVCo, separately moved to dismiss the Amended Complaint. (Bank Defs. Mot. 
to Dismiss, Docket Entry No. 301; Discover Mot. to Dismiss, Docket Entry No. 305.) "
761,6," Fine Fare Supermarket is not a party to a CAA with American Express and does not accept its cards. (Pls. Letter dated Oct. 20, 
2017, Docket Entry No. 604.) Because Judge Alsup transferred B & R Supermarket's and Monsieur Marcel's direct claims 
against American Express to the Southern District of New York pursuant to the CAA, Fine Fare Supermarket is the only named 
Plaintiff with claims against American Express. However, because Fine Fare Supermarket does not accept American Express 
and has no agreement with American Express, it seeks only joint and several liability against American Express based on 
chargebacks by Mastercard, Visa, and Discover. (Id.)"
761,7," Plaintiffs also sought ""to certify three subclasses of merchants from California, Florida, and New York, each of whom brings 
claims under their respective state's antitrust and consumer protection laws."" B & R I, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 136204, [WL] at *3. 
Because Plaintiffs failed to show how each of the subclasses met the Rule 23 class certification requirements, the Court denied 
the request for subclass certification. 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 136204, [WL] at *3 n.7. In their renewed motion for class 
certification, Plaintiffs appear to only request certification of a nationwide class, and do not request subclass certification. (See 
Pls. Mem. 2.) "
762,8," The certification of the EMV payment system consists of multiple steps and involves ""numerous entities,"" such as PIN pad 
manufacturers, EMVCo, bank-acquirers, and others. (Am. Compl. ¶ 85.) "
763,9," Defendants incorporate their original opposition briefs into their renewed opposition. (Defs. Opp'n 4 n.1 (citing Defs. Opp'n to 
Pls. Mot. for Class Certification (""Defs. Original Opp'n""), Docket Entry No. 460; Defs. Suppl. Br.).)"
763,10," Defendants argue that ""[t]o try to address ascertainability, Plaintiffs have had to abandon (and reverse) key aspects of their 
prior liability theory."" (Defs. Opp'n 5.) Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have changed their theory as to (1) ""[n]ecessity of 
[L]iability [S]hifts""; (2) ""[w]hether alignment of [L]iability [S]hift dates requires collusion or is a competitive outcome""; and (3) 
""[f]ear of merchant steering as the motive for competing to have the latest [L]iability [S]hift."" (Id. at 5-6.) In support, Defendants argue that (1) while Plaintiffs' prior but-for world included networks with no Liability Shift, in their revised 
but-for world, all Defendants would have eventually imposed the Liability Shift; (2) while previously Defendants' 'lock-step 
implementation' of [the] [L]iability [S]hift[] was because of (and a plus factor for) collusion,"" in Plaintiffs' revised theory, ""absent 
collusion, all networks would have synchronized initial dates, and then delayed to 2017 in 'lockstep""; and (3) while previously, 
Plaintiffs alleged that Defendants ""viewed having an earlier [L]iability [S]hift date than other networks to be a competitive 
advantage because they expected that merchants would steer volume to networks with later dates,"" and therefore ""an 
agreement to hold the same early dates was . . . necessary for networks not to compete to delay,"" Plaintiffs' expert's ""new report 
does not mention merchant steering as an influence,"" and ""[n]ow, [Defendants] had independent, pro-competitive business 
reasons for not being 'out of sync' with other networks and viewed having a later [L]iability [S]hift date as a competitive 
disadvantage."" (Id. (alterations and emphasis omitted) (quoting Am. Compl. ¶ 150).)"
763,11," In the March 2018 Order, the Court noted that ""if Plaintiffs choose to renew their motion for class certification, in addition to 
addressing the ascertainability requirement, Plaintiffs must also further address the predominance issues raised by Defendants 
and discussed at the hearing, in particular, the issues of commonality of injury and causation."" B & R II, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
42547, 2018 WL 1335355, at *13 n.24."
763,12," In price-fixing antitrust cases, injury and damages are typically determined by comparing prices resulting from the antitrust 
violation to prices in the world free of the defendants' antitrust violation. See, e.g., Cordes & Co. Fin. Servs. v. A.G. Edwards & 
Sons, Inc., 502 F.3d 91, 97 (2d Cir. 2007). This construct of the world without Defendants' antitrust violation is known as the 
""but-for world."" Id.; In re Digital Music Antitrust Litig., 321 F.R.D. 64, 91 (S.D.N.Y. 2017). "
764,13," American Express joins Mastercard, Visa, and Discover's opposition as to their objection that Plaintiffs have not satisfied the 
Rule 23(b)(3) predominance requirement. (See AmEx Opp'n 1.)"
764,14," Discover also argues that, [f]or the reasons articulated"" by American Express, the Court should not grant Plaintiffs' renewed 
motion as to Discover because ""the only specific assertion in Plaintiffs' brief as to Discover is that it 'aligned,' and their only 
evidence cited reflects Discover's intent to follow the industry."" (Defs. Opp'n 33 n.34.) Discover argues that ""these allegations of 
mere parallel conduct are not enough to sustain a claim . . . against Discover,"" in light of ""Plaintiffs' revised . . . theory [with] a 
but-for world in which competition would have caused all four networks to set the same [L]iability [S]hift date."" (Id.)"

783,49," In support of their prior motion, Plaintiffs argued that that the Court should assume that bank acquirers passed on those 
chargebacks to merchants because many major bank acquirers made statements that merchants will be responsible for 
chargebacks following the Liability Shift. (Nov. 29, 2017 Hr'g Tr. 14-15; Am. Compl. ¶¶ 185-97.) In the Amended Complaint, 
Plaintiffs quote statements made by the top ten acquirers recognizing merchants' responsibility for chargebacks, following the 
Liability Shift date by the networks. For example, Plaintiffs quote Bank of America Merchant Services, the fourth largest acquirer, 
stating: ""All of the card organizations have chosen October 1, 2015, as the date when liability for counterfeit fraudulent 
transactions will shift to the merchant if the merchant has not adopted POS solutions that are capable of processing EMV chip 
cards."" (Am. Compl. ¶ 189.) In support of their renewed motion, Plaintiffs argue that Officer's analysis of merchant agreements and annual filings ""comports 
with"" the ""contemporaneous statements"" by the ""largest acquirers and processors . . . that, after the FLS on October 1,2015, 
merchants would bear the costs for chargeback liability if a chip-card transaction occurred on a non-certified EMV terminal."" (Pls. 
Mem. 21; Am. Compl. ¶¶ 185-97.) "
784,50," Defendants assert that ""[t]his flaw was not evident in [Officer's] initial reports,"" which ""appeared to assume a but-for world with 
no [L]iability [S]hifts through 'the present day,'"" but that ""in the new but-for world with aligned [L]iability [S]hift dates for all 
networks, the assumption of a 'zero' [but-for world] price is transparently wrong."" (Defs. Opp'n 11 n.7 (quoting B & R II, 2018

787,57," Defendants also argue that while ""Plaintiffs' class definition includes cross-border chargebacks,"" neither Officer nor Plaintiffs 
have ""identif[ied] any evidence supporting a delay"" of the Fraud Liability Shift for cross-border chargebacks, and thus ""[o]ne must 
assume . . . that the cross-border shifts would have occurred in October 2015 in a but-for world."" (Defs. Opp'n 42.) Defendants 
argue that this raises ""two predominance problems"": (1) ""Officer does not even know if he can identify cross-border chargebacks 
to quantify them in the aggregate or exclude merchants that had only cross-border chargebacks and thus were not injured,"" and 
(2) ""Officer should have considered whether, which, and when merchants would have adopted EMV in response to cross-border 
FLS chargebacks beginning in October 2015 but domestic FLS chargebacks not starting until October 2017."" (Id. at 42-43. In his rebuttal report. Officer states that he [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT]"

App. D.C. 86 (D.C. Cir. 2019). "
788,59," Defendants' argument that a ""post-trial claims administration process cannot constitutionally address individual causation and 
injury-in-fact,"" and that such a ""process would 'do away with [their] rights . . . to raise plausible individual challenges on those 
issues' to a jury at trial and thereby deny '[D]efendants' Seventh Amendment and due process rights,'"" (Defs. Opp'n 43-44 
(quoting In re Asacol, 907 F.3d 42,51-52 (1st Cir. 2018))), fails for similar reasons."
788,60," Plaintiffs include this and other arguments in the section of their brief arguing that they have satisfied the predominance inquiry 
as to the damages element of their antitrust claim. (Pls. Mem. 22-25; Pls. Reply 21.) Defendants' brief, meanwhile, includes no 
section devoted to whether Plaintiffs have satisfied predominance as to the damages element. (See Defs. Opp'n.) The Court 
assumes that this reflects a strategic choice by the parties, given that the need for individual inquiries as to damages will 
generally not defeat class certification. Accordingly, the Court addresses the parties' arguments according to where they appear 
to logically belong, rather than where they are in the parties' briefs. "
791,61," In explaining why a competitive response by Defendants would have resulted in a delay of the Liability Shift, Officer

""Plaintiffs cite two American Express documents noting that American Express intended to follow the industry in setting its FLS."" 
(AmEx Opp'n 17-18 (first quoting Pls. Mem. 11; and then citing Pls. Mem. 11-13).) In contrast to the allegations that Mastercard

834,7," ""In general, '[p]assing on describes the action of an overcharged buyer who passes the extra expense on to those who buy 
from him.'"" Warren Gen. Hosp. v. Amgen Inc., 643 F.3d 77, 85 n.9 (3d Cir. 2011) (quoting In re Sugar Industry Antitrust 
Litigation, 579 F.2d 13, 16 n.4 (3d Cir. 1978)). "
836,8," The Supply Agreement is governed by New York law. (Pl.'s Facts, Ex. 2 ¶ 20.5.)"
836,9," Defendants argue that, despite executing the assignment agreement, C&S did not actually assign any claims to Bi-Lo. The 
Court finds Defendants' argument difficult to understand. The agreement says, ""Upon the Effective Date of this Agreement, C&S, 
for good and valuable consideration and without any further action by any Party, shall be deemed to have absolutely, 
unconditionally, and irrevocably sold, transferred, assigned, and conveyed unto SEG all of its rights, title, and interest in, to, and 
under the Antitrust Claims."" (Pl.'s Facts, Ex. 3 at ¶ 7.) The agreement in turn defines ""Antitrust Claims"" as ""claims and causes of 
action that C&S may have under the antitrust or similar laws . . . arising out of or relating to C&S's purchase of Disputed 
Products from any of the Defendants that C&S sold to SEG during the Relevant Time Period[.]""(Id. at ¶ 3(a).) Any reasonable 
reading of that language yields the conclusion that C&S assigned antitrust claims to Bi-Lo. "
837,10," The court reasoned that: [under the common law of contracts,] unless the obligor has consented, the partial assignee may not maintain the original 
suit against the obligor unless all parties having the collective right to the entire claim are joined in the proceeding. Thus, 
partial assignments are recognized, but the rights of the obligor to be free of successive and repeated suits growing out of 
the same basic facts are also protected by the prudent use of joinder rules. If a suit is brought by either an assignor or 
partial assignee, the obligor has the option of requiring joinder of the necessary parties or resorting to interpleader. . . .With 
respect to the claims to which it holds partial assignments, Washington can be made a party but, unlike other class 
members, will not have the right to opt out. The compulsory joinder provisions of Rule 19 and the necessity to give 
protection to the obligors from additional litigation from partial assignees require such a result. Id. at 1091 (citations omitted). "
838,11," Bi-Lo is incorrect when it asserts that its assignment from C&S was complete rather than partial. HN10[
] A partial 
assignment occurs where the assignee is ""authorized to demand from the obligor directly payment of its part of the claim but 
shall not be authorized to demand payment of the whole."" 29 Williston on Contracts § 74:72 (4th ed. 1999). Here, C&S assigned 
Bi-Lo the right to collect damages based on the mushrooms C&S bought from Defendant and sold to Bi-Lo, but not the 
mushrooms C&S did not sell to Bi-Lo. That is a partial assignment. "
839,12," Class members may, of course, petition the court for leave to remove themselves from the class after the opt-out deadline has 
passed. See In re Processed Egg Prods. Antitrust Litig., 130 F. Supp. 3d 945, 953 (E.D. Pa. 2015). However, such relief is 
discretionary, and therefore not indicative of any sort of right on the part of the class member."
839,13," Thus Bi-Lo is wrong in its assertion that ""the effect of Bi-Lo's timely opt out for the certified class and the first round of 
settlements [with Creekside, Kitchen Pride, and Giorgi] carried through to the second round of class settlements [with the rest of 
the class]."" (Bi-Lo's Brief, at 9.) Bi-Lo is correct insofar as it recognizes its initial opt out excluded it from the class for all 
purposes going forward. However, as the above analysis details, Bi-Lo's status as a non-class member does not mean the 
claims assigned to it by C&S are free from constraints imposed on class claims. "
840,14," Bi-Lo argues that a different common law principle controls, namely that ""[w]hen the obligor has notice of an assignment by 
the plaintiff-and the assignee is not joined-a judgment for or against the obligor will not bar a later suit by the assignee."" (Bi-Lo's 
Brief, at 4) (quoting In re Fine Paper, 632 F.2d at 1091 which in turn cites Restatement (Second) of Judgments § 104 (Tent. 
Draft No. 3, 1976)); see also Restatement (Second) of Judgments § 55 (1982). This principle was cited as one of the bases for 
the rule in Fine Paper. Applying this principle, Bi-Lo claims that Defendants had notice of the assignment in July 2019, failed to 
join Bi-Lo before settling the class claims, and therefore cannot now move for summary judgment on the grounds that Bi-Lo's 
assigned claims were extinguished in the class settlement. There are two problems with Bi-Lo's argument. First, the principle Bi-Lo cites does not displace the equally fundamental principle 
of nemo dat—assignments are taken subject to whatever defenses could have been leveled against the assignor. Application of 
that principle here is sufficient to find Bi-Lo lacks the right to pursue its assigned claims in an individual damage action without 
analysis of notice or consent on the part of the Defendants. The fact that the Fine Paper court invoked a different principle on 
facts where nemo dat could not apply does not displace that conclusion. Second, the reason the Fine Paper court invoked the 
principle Bi-Lo cites is not present here. It is true that Second, the reason the Fine Paper court invoked the principle Bi-Lo cites is not present here. It is true that disposition of an 
assignor's claims against an obligor does not bar suit by a partial assignee if it occurs after the obligor has notice of the 
assignment. But the reason is that (with limited exceptions) the moment the obligor receives notice of the assignment serves as 
an inflection point whereby the assignee is subject to ""any defense or claim that accrues in favor of the obligor before it receives 
notification of the assignment"" but not ones that accrued after. 29 Williston on Contracts § 74:56 (4th ed. 1999) This mattered in 
Fine Paper, where any potential defense of res judicata would have accrued after defendants had notice of the assignment. 
Here, however, the defense Defendants invoke accrued before the assignment occurred. Therefore, the rule cited by Bi-Lo, 
while applicable in Fine Paper, is not applicable here. "
844,15," The Court does not understand Bi-Lo to be arguing that C&S failed to remove itself from the class during the opt out period 
due to excusable neglected, and that Bi-Lo, as C&S's assignee, may now move for leave on that basis. In any event, there is no 
question C&S is properly within the class and that Bi-Lo, as only a partial assignee of C&S's claims, cannot challenge the 
propriety of C&S's class membership overall. "

864,6," Examples of “very commercial” films include the franchises Star Wars, X-Men, and Mission: Impossible, as well as Pixar films."
864,7," The Palme's business plan therefore called for “a collection of main titles” that were “supplement[ed] in the other screens … 
with titles that people weren't very familiar with,” including independent and foreign films. “[D]uring the trailers” for first-run 
commercial movies, the Palme “would show all the other films [it was] screening at the theatre.” "
865,8," Flagship does not argue that such multifilm licensing agreements (as opposed to multitheater agreements) constitute a form of 
circuit dealing, nor would such an argument find support in the current law. "
866,9," This case came before this court on two occasions before proceeding to trial. First, in 2011, we reversed the trial court's initial 
summary judgment ruling in Century's favor based on the sufficiency of the evidence to establish antitrust injury. We further held 
that “the court [had] abused its discretion by making discovery rulings that impermissibly curtailed Flagship's efforts to gather 
evidence of circuit dealing” outside the Coachella Valley, and reversed the summary judgment ruling on this basis as well. 
(Flagship I, supra, 198 Cal.App.4th at p. 1383.) After further discovery, the case was dismissed in 2014 on the eve of trial based 
on a spoliation issue. In 2016, we reversed that ruling (see Flagship Theatres of Palm Desert v. Century Theatres, Inc. (May 24, 
2016, B257148) [nonpub. opn.]), and the case ultimately proceeded to trial in 2018."
866,10," The court identified as the elements of a nonmonopoly circuit-dealing claim that: (1) Century “was a dominant theatre circuit”; 
(2) Century “pooled its purchasing power to enter into licensing agreements for specific films that included multiple theatres, 
including, at least, [T]he River and one or more other theatres”; (3) “by entering into such multiple theatre licensing agreements, 
the film distributors were precluded from determining on a theatre-by-theatre basis which theatres would be licensed for a 
particular film, thereby eliminating the opportunity for the small competitor to obtain the choice first[-]runs”; (4) “[p]laintiff was in 
fact precluded from competing for first[-]run films as a result of [Century] entering into multiple theatre licensing agreements”; 
and (5) plaintiff suffered damages as a result."
866,11," Although the latter additional instruction did not specifically state that the harm must occur in a defined relevant market, the 
special verdict form required a finding to this effect."
866,12," The jury was instructed that the elements of such a claim were that: (1) Century “possessed sufficient market power outside 
the market where the Palme and [T]he River competed”; (2) Century “used its market power by communicating to a film 
distributor that [Century] will not exhibit the distributor's films in [Century] theatres outside the market where the Palme and [T]he 
River competed in order to coerce the distributor to allocate films exclusively to [T]he River rather than the Palme”; (3) this “use "
867,," of its market power caused a film distributor to agree to license first[-]run films exclusively to [T]he River, rather than to the 
Palme, in a manner contrary to the film distributor's own best interest and that prevents the licensing of films theatre by theatre”; 
and (4) plaintiff suffered damages as a result."
867,13," The jury verdict form references harm to competition in the form of either increased prices or reduced output, and does not 
require the jury to indicate which it found to be true. All parties acknowledge, however, that Flagship has never argued a price 
effect, and that no evidence regarding pricing was presented at trial. We therefore focus solely on the output restriction language 
in the jury's finding. "
868,14," Flagship also argues that, even if the rule of reason applies, substantial evidence supports the jury's findings under the rule of 
reason as well. We address these arguments in the Discussion part II., post. "
870,15," Flagship neither alleged, nor offered any evidence suggesting, that there was a broader hub-and-spoke conspiracy between 
and among the distributors, or that any of the distributors was vertically integrated with any exhibitor entity. Rather, Flagship's 
theory involved multiple agreements, each between one distributor and Century, which is neither owned nor controlled by any 
distributor. "
871,16," “The extreme example of a deficiency of interbrand competition is monopoly, where there is only one manufacturer. In 
contrast, intrabrand competition is the competition between the distributors—wholesale or retail—of the product of a particular 
manufacturer. [¶] The degree of intrabrand competition is wholly independent of the level of interbrand competition confronting 
the manufacturer. Thus, there may be fierce intrabrand competition among the distributors of a product produced by a 
monopolist and no intrabrand competition among the distributors of a product produced by a firm in a highly competitive industry. 
But when interbrand competition exists, as it does among television manufacturers, it provides a significant check on the 
exploitation of intrabrand market power because of the ability of consumers to substitute a different brand of the same product.” 
(Sylvania, supra, 433 U.S. at p. 52, fn. 19.) "
872,17," Although NYNEX acknowledged the possibility that a vertical agreement restricting price might warrant per se treatment, the 
court has since held that vertical agreements regarding resale prices are also subject to the rule of reason, and for largely the 
same reasons that nonprice vertical restraints are. (See Leegin, supra, 551 U.S. at pp. 890–894.) "
873,18," We do not discuss some of the Sherman Act cases Flagship cites that predate the significant changes in federal antitrust law 
(and, in some cases, the significant changes in the film industry) outlined in the Discussion part I.C.1. (see pp. 216–219ante) 
and thus are not instructive. (See Beech Cinema v. Twentieth Century-Fox Film (2d Cir. 1980) 622 F.2d 1106; Columbia 
Pictures Corp. v. Charles Rubenstein, Inc. (8th Cir. 1961) 289 F.2d 418; Fox West Coast Theatres Corp. v. Paradise Theatre 
Building Corp. (9th Cir. 1958) 264 F.2d 602; Bordonaro Bros. Theatres v. Paramount Pictures (2d Cir. 1949) 176 F.2d 594.) 
Moreover, none of these cases addresses the correct analytical framework for circuit-dealing claims, but rather various other 
issues not directly relevant to this appeal, such as the sufficiency of evidence supporting the existence of the conspiracy alleged."
873,19," The parties raised this issue in Flagship I. (Flagship I, supra, 198 Cal.App.4th at p. 1386.) At the time, however, they had not 
briefed all the legal issues relevant to deciding which antitrust analytical framework applied, and the record was insufficient to 
determine the exact nature of Flagship's circuit-dealing claims. (Id. at pp. 1386–1387.) We noted that “[t]he type of circuit[-
]dealing claim at issue might influence the analysis of whether the per se rule or the rule of reason should apply,” in that it “might 
make certain authorities or analogies more relevant than others,” and declined to decide the issue. (Ibid.) "
874,20," In Cobb, the defendants did argue in their reply brief that the rule of reason, rather than a per se analysis, applied to all circuit-
dealing claims, but the court did not address the argument except to note that “[d]efendants suggest that circuit dealing should 
be scrutinized under the rule of reason. Even if that were true, the [c]ourt's analysis here would not change.” (Cobb, supra, 101 
F.Supp.3d at p. 1343.) "
876,21," For this same reason, in the wake of NYNEX, we do not find Flagship's citation to Movie 1 & 2 v. United Artists 
Communications (9th Cir. 1990) 909 F.2d 1245 to be persuasive authority for the proposition that nonhorizontal “group boycotts 
that directly or indirectly cut off necessary access to customers or suppliers” are per se Sherman Act violations. (Movie 1 & 2, at 
p. 1253.) Movie 1 & 2 is also inapposite in that it involved a boycott with horizontal components. (Id. at p. 1248 [distributor 
defendants alleged to have concertedly refused to deal with plaintiff theater and to have assisted with a split agreement between 
one distributor defendant and a theater defendant].) "
878,22," The idea that licenses for first-run films are interchangeable products—or, for that matter, that tickets to view first-run films are 
interchangeable products—is counterintuitive, given that there may be significant differences between any given first-run film 
and another. In concrete terms, it is hard to understand how the right to exhibit, or the right to view, an R-rated action movie is 
interchangeable with the right to exhibit or view a G-rated animated film. Given the role of first-run films as a group in the 
economics of the movie theater business, however, movie theater industry cases appear to have accepted this concept, and the 
parties do not challenge it here. "
879,23," HN26[
] CA(25)[
] (25) Nor do the antitrust laws view this as inherently anticompetitive—rather, in order for a clearance to 
violate the antitrust laws, a plaintiff must show something beyond the inherent limitations a clearance places on the number of 
film licenses granted for a particular film in a particular area. “[T]he reasonableness of a clearance under section 1 of the 
Sherman Act depends on the competitive stance of the theaters involved and the clearance's effect on competition, especially 
the interbrand competition … .” (Orson, supra, 79 F.3d at p. 1372; see Tarzana, supra, 828 F.2d at p. 1399 [clearances “are 
reasonable if they are likely to promote interbrand competition without overly restricting intrabrand competition”].) The Ninth 
Circuit has identified the following factors for the purposes of analyzing the competitive effects of a clearance beyond the "
880,," inherent limitation on the number of licenses awarded in the clearance zone: (1) “the proximity of the theaters”; (2) “the location 
of theaters with respect to major thoroughfares”; (3) “whether transportation barriers exist between the theaters”; (4) “whether 
the plaintiff theater bid on the clearances”; (5) “whether the plaintiff acknowledged that his theater was substantially competitive 
with the defendant”; (6) “whether the theaters drew customers from the same geographical area”; and (7) “whether the theaters 
advertised throughout the same geographical area.” (Soffer, supra, 1996 WL 194947 at p. *4, citing Tarzana, supra, 828 F.2d at 
p. 1399.) "
883,24," Century's expert economist calculated more specifically that 37 percent of the first-run films shown at the Tristone in its 15 
years were not exhibited at any other Coachella Valley theater. Although this represents a drop from the 55 percent he 
calculated for the Palme over the course of its approximately 13-year existence, this does not provide a basis for concluding that 
the overall number of independent films at all Coachella Valley theaters dropped as a result of the Palme's closure. "

891,2," From this point forward, our reference to HIPAA also includes a reference to the HITECH Act."
891,3," Specifically, the Pharmacies contend that ESI has violated two provisions of HIPAA, which can be pursued and enforced under 
their contract claim. In violation of 45 C.F.R. § 164.504(g)(2), the Pharmacies first claim that ESI, as a clearinghouse, legally 
receives the Pharmacies' customer information to process and reimburse the Pharmacies' claims. But as a healthcare service 
provider, the Pharmacies allege that ESI illegally converts the information to steal the Pharmacies' customers upon refilling the 
customers' prescriptions. See id. § 164.504(g)(2) (""A covered entity that performs multiple covered functions may use . . . the 
protected health information of individuals who receive the covered entity's health plan or health care provider services, but not 
both, only for purposes related to the appropriate function being performed.""). Based on this same conduct, the Pharmacies aver 
that ESI continues to blatantly violate the general rule found in 45 C.F.R. § 164.508(a)(1), which provides, ""A covered entity may 
not use . . . protected health information without an authorization that is valid . . . . When a covered entity obtains or receives a

Based on Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Tech. Servs., Inc., we recognize that the ""aftermarket"" in this case can serve as a 
separate market in which ESI could potentially hold sufficient monopoly power. 504 U.S. 451, 482, 112 S. Ct. 2072, 119 L. Ed. 
2d 265 (1992) (""This Court's prior cases support the proposition that in some instances one brand of a product can constitute a 
separate market.""). But as we highlighted in our analysis, we reject the Pharmacies' alleged relevant market here, i.e., the 
""aftermarket,"" on the basis of its inadequate product market description, which does not include all of the Pharmacies' 
interchangeable payment options. "

the information sought. (#203-7 at 2.) "
913,1," The parties also refer to ""supra-FRAND"" royalties and licenses. To avoid confusion as to what it literally means to be something 
other than fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory, the Court will instead use the term ""non-FRAND."""
913,2," The parties did not modify their appendices on the Motion to Dismiss or Plaintiff's Request for Judicial Notice. [ECF Nos. 162-1, 
182-1, 193-1]. "
914,3," Defendants challenge Plaintiff's use of allegations that are based on ""information and belief."" [Motion at 13 n. 3]. HN3[
] 
However, ""'information and belief' pleadings are generally deemed permissible under the Federal Rules."" Johnson v. Johnson, 
385 F.3d 503, 531 n. 19 (5th Cir. 2004). Therefore, the Court will consider such pleadings in light of the other facts alleged to 
determine whether the FAC is adequate. See Funk v. Stryker Corp., 673 F. Supp. 2d 522, 525 (S.D. Tex. 2009), aff'd, 631 F.3d 
777 (5th Cir. 2011) (""Accordingly, this court reviews allegations based upon information and belief under Twombly's 12(b)(6) 
formulation requiring sufficient fact pleading to make a claim plausible.""). "
916,4," Plaintiff also references a press release from the Conversant Defendant, describing its enforcement of an SEP in an English 
patent infringement proceeding, but that case does not involve vehicle manufacturers. [FAC ¶ 91]."
916,5," The Nokia and Optis Defendants cite declarations challenging Plaintiff's characterization of their negotiations with Plaintiff and 
whether they actually denied Plaintiff a FRAND license. [Motion at 4 n. 2, 28, 29 n. 12]. To the extent that these Defendants 
make a factual challenge to standing and ripeness, this determination of fact is intertwined with the merits of whether Defendants 
have violated their FRAND obligations to Plaintiff. Therefore, the Court will not now resolve these disputed facts. See Clark v. 
Tarrant Cty., Texas, 798 F.2d 736, 741-42 (5th Cir. 1986) (HN10[
] ""Where the factual findings regarding subject matter 
jurisdiction are intertwined with the merits . . . the case should not be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction unless the 
alleged claim is immaterial or is wholly insubstantial and frivolous.""). The Optis Defendants separately argue that, with respect to 
all of Plaintiff's claims except the declaratory judgment claims, the FAC has only made a conclusory allegation that it has denied 
Plaintiff FRAND licenses. [Motion at 29]. However, Plaintiff alleges that it contacted the Optis Defendants, attempting to obtain a 
FRAND license, but was denied. [FAC ¶ 144]. This adequately alleges that the Optis Defendants have withheld a FRAND 
license from Plaintiff."
916,6," Contrary to Defendants' arguments that the dispute is not ripe, because licensing negotiations are ""ongoing"" [Motion at 24], 
Plaintiff alleges that those Defendants have either refused to license to Plaintiff or made offers that Plaintiff considers unlawful. 
[FAC ¶¶ 140-44]. This pleads a ripe licensing dispute following the breakdown of negotiations. See HTC Corp., 2018 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 212292, 2018 WL 6617795, at *3 (finding jurisdiction when ""'HTC unilaterally put an end to the parties' negotiations when 
it filed a lawsuit against Ericsson . . . alleg[ing] that Ericsson breached FRAND and did not negotiate with HTC in good faith.'"")

alleged refusal to take a FRAND license to the LTE patents, a sufficient controversy exists to confer subject matter jurisdiction.""). "
917,7, The parties agree that ATIS and TIA are U.S. SSOs. [See Response at 23; Reply at 11]. 
919,8," See Cargill, Inc. v. Monfort of Colorado, Inc., 479 U.S. 104, 111 n. 6, 107 S. Ct. 484, 93 L. Ed. 2d 427 (1986). "
920,9," The Court assumes, without deciding, that Plaintiff has adequately alleged a market for antitrust purposes."
920,10," The Court notes that the parties analyze Defendants' conduct as a boycott, rather than as price fixing. [Motion at 13; 
Response at 10]. Price fixing and boycotts can be related, given that increased prices and constricted supply are economically 
dependent on one another. See F.T.C. v. Superior Court Trial Lawyers Ass'n, 493 U.S. 411, 423, 110 S. Ct. 768, 107 L. Ed. 2d 
851 (1990) (describing respondents' boycott as a ""constriction of supply"" and ""the essence of 'price-fixing'"" and stating that ""[t]he 
horizontal arrangement among these competitors was unquestionably a 'naked restraint' on price and output""). Defendants' 
alleged agreement to boycott is not typical in that Plaintiff does not allege that Defendants boycotted to harm Defendants' 
competitors. What's more Defendants' alleged boycott is interdependent with their alleged agreement to exclude Plaintiff or to 
require licensing terms that Plaintiff cannot afford. Given that case law analyzes patent and licensing pools as a form of 
horizontal price fixing, and the parties cite to cases analyzing price fixing in their briefing, the Court interprets Plaintiff's 
allegations as price fixing. See, e.g., Wuxi Multimedia, Ltd. v. Koninklijke Philips Elecs., N.V., 04CV1136 DMS BLM, 2006 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 9160, 2006 WL 6667002, at *4 (S.D. Cal. Jan. 5, 2006) (analyzing defendants' alleged patent pooling arrangement 
under plaintiffs' horizontal price fixing claim). Plaintiff also alleges that the Avanci platform unlawfully ties essential and 
nonessential patents together, but includes only the conclusory assertion that such tying has occurred. [FAC ¶¶ 116, 171]. 
Therefore, the Court concludes that Plaintiff has not properly pled tying allegations."
920,11," A patent pool may be a per se unlawful restraint of trade when its ""only apparent purpose is naked price fixing."" Nero AG, 
2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 119030, 2010 WL 4366448, at *6. Plaintiff does not make any such allegation or argument here. "
921,12," As the Government maintains, standards literally exclude certain technologies that are not included in the standard, but 
generate ""consumer benefits of interoperability or safety. . . . The reduction in consumer choice that occurs when a winning "
922,," technology is selected for inclusion in a standard can be offset by the standard's many procompetitive benefits, including 
enhanced interoperability of products and services and follow-on innovation."" [Statement of Interest at 12]."
922,13," Furthermore, the use of antitrust remedies to address an SEP holder's contractual FRAND obligations may deter patent 
holders from seeking inclusion in the standard, thereby inhibiting the achievement of the procompetitive goals of the standard 
setting process. [See Statement of Interest at 23]. The Court must be cautious ""about using the antitrust laws to remedy what 
are essentially contractual disputes between private parties engaged in the pursuit of technological innovation."" F.T.C. v. 
Qualcomm Inc., 969 F.3d 974, 2020 WL 4591476, at *14."
922,14," Plaintiff also contends that Defendants have violated § 2 by engaging in unlawful maintenance of their monopoly power. 
[Reply at 16]. Specifically, Plaintiff asserts that when SEP holders, such as Defendants, purposefully renege on FRAND 
commitments, they violate § 2's proscription of maintenance of monopoly power. [Id.]. Plaintiff does not cite any case law in 
support of its argument. The Court finds that these allegations do not support a § 2 claim based on unlawful maintenance of 
monopoly power. "
923,15," The Court is also skeptical that such exclusion has been properly alleged. Plaintiff only includes conclusory allegations that 
alternatives were presented and rejected by the SSOs for the 3G and 4G standards and that if there were no alternatives to a 
given technology, the SSOs would have been obligated to abandon those parts of the standard. [FAC ¶¶ 119-20, 183]. There is 
no indication of what these potential alternatives were, that they were alternatives to any of Defendants' SEPs, or that they were 
excluded because of Defendants' allegedly fraudulent FRAND declarations. Even if the SSOs had known that the Licensor 
Defendants did not intend to comply with their FRAND obligations, the SSOs may nevertheless have adopted the Licensor 
Defendants' SEPs and chosen to insure compliance based on the Licensor Defendants' contractually binding FRAND 
commitments, which are enforceable regardless of any alleged deception by the Licensor Defendants."
923,16," HN27[
] While Defendants do not argue that the Court does not have or should not exercise jurisdiction over the non-
antitrust claims if the antitrust claims are dismissed, a ""federal court may raise subject matter jurisdiction sua sponte."" McDonal 
v. Abbott Labs., 408 F.3d 177, 182 n. 5 (5th Cir. 2005). "
924,17," Even if the underlying dispute related to a potential patent infringement action against Plaintiff, the declaratory judgment 
claims would not be ripe. HN30[
] The Declaratory Judgment Act requires an ""actual controversy,"" which is ""rooted in Article III 
of the Constitution."" SanDisk Corp. v. STMicroelectronics, Inc., 480 F.3d 1372, 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2007). An actual controversy 
regarding potential patent infringement only exists ""where a patentee asserts rights under a patent based on certain identified 
ongoing or planned activity of another party, and where that party contends that it has the right to engage in the accused activity 
without license."" Id. at 1381. Plaintiff alleges no such conduct here. "
927,1," Bracketed numbers refer to entries on the district court docket and are followed by the page and / or paragraph number. Page 
numbers refer to the ECF page number."
927,2," This and other instances in the complaint refer to ""initial"" certification. In this instance, for example, the complaint states that 
ABPN first began selling ""initial"" certifications in 1935—not merely ""certifications."" [1] at 6 ¶ 19. But the complaint also alleges 
that initially, ABPN's certifications were lifelong and lacked subsequent examinations or requirements. [1] at 6 ¶ 21. The court 
takes as true well-pleaded factual allegations, but in this instance the separate allegation that originally ABPN's certifications 
were lifelong suggests that to the extent ""initial"" connotes ""time-limited,"" ""initial"" is not an appropriate descriptor for certifications 
ABPN issued before 1994. "
932,3," The relevant time period in which ABPN actually sold MOC could be shorter than 26 years. Physicians purchasing ABPN initial 
certification from 1994 on would have the initial certification until at least 2004 (later for physicians purchasing ABPN initial 
certification after 1994) and thus would have no need to complete compliance with MOC requirements until at least 2004. 
According to the complaint, ABPN began selling MOC ""[b]y no later than 2002."" [1] at 19 ¶ 67. "
934,4," Cf. Schachar, 870 F.2d at 399 (""[W]hen a trade association provides information (there, gives a seal of approval) but does not

Ass'n, 956 F.2d 1378, 1383 (7th Cir. 1992) (""'[W]hen a trade association provides information' (by giving its approval in that 
case, its disapproval in this case) 'but does not constrain others to follow its recommendations, it does not violate the antitrust 
laws.'"") (quoting Schachar, 870 F.2d at 399); United States Bd. of Oral Implantology v. Am. Bd. of Dental Specialties, 390 F. 
Supp. 3d 892, 906 (N.D. Ill. 2019) (""If the certifying entity lacks the power to prevent (or has not prevented) the professional from 
practicing without a certification, there has been no antitrust violation."")."
934,5," In light of this conclusion, the court does not reach Defendant's remaining arguments, including whether plaintiffs have 
sufficiently pleaded an unreasonable restraint of trade or substantial market power, or whether plaintiffs' claims are timely. [23] at 
10-14. "
937,1," The operative complaint in this case is the Second Amended Complaint (Doc. 24). Unless otherwise indicated, any reference in 
this order to ""the Complaint"" is a reference to the Second Amended Complaint. "
939,2," This court notes the obvious caveat that not every member nurse is in competition with each other, as geography and other 
market factors necessarily create numerous labor markets within the nation-wide industry. "
940,3," NIFA's contention that ""AORN and its members [are] the only competing economic actors in this market,"" Resp. to MTD, at 2 
(Doc. 40), is simply wrong on the facts alleged. AORN does not compete with its members, and NIFA does not compete with the 
very nurses to whom it is trying to sell its products. "
941,4," NIFA argues in its response to the MTD that AORN only refutes the per se allegation and not any Rule of Reason allegations, 
thereby waiving any challenge to its Rule of Reason claims. Resp. at 14 (Doc. 40). This court does not agree. It is true that 
AORN's motion does not neatly parse alleged per se violations from alleged Rule of Reason violations. But NIFA has not 
provided any authority suggesting AORN had to specifically object to alleged per se and Rule of Reason violations separately. 
AORN moved to dismiss the entirety of each antitrust claim, including all alleged violations. Indeed, AORN's motion did 
specifically find fault with the allegations made to support any of NIFA's Rule of Reason theories. "
974,1," The parties filed portions of their motions for summary judgment and attached exhibits under seal. Due to the nature of the 
sealed material, the Court granted the parties' request to seal many of these motions. See ECF No. 1240. While the Court would 
prefer to keep all the sealed information confidential, some of it is necessary to resolve the pending motions. The Court will 
therefore include the information unredacted in this order where appropriate. The Court recognizes that the parties have privacy 
interests in the confidential information, but the public has an even greater interest in the reasoning behind the Court's Order 
today. The Court will refer to the sealed pleadings with an ""-s"" designation and, for clarity, will cite to the sealed document for 
pinpoint citations unless otherwise noted."
974,2," The Court uses ""Oracle I"" to refer to the entirety of case number 2:10-cv-00106-LRH-VCF, and for citations to the record in that 
case. All other ECF Numbers cited throughout this Order refer to the docket in the above captioned case. "
975,3," The Court refers to its Order in Oracle USA, Inc. v. Rimini Street, Inc., 6 F.Supp.3d 1086, 1096-98 (D. Nev. 2014) as 
""Oracle [**32]  USA"" in citations."
975,4," The Court refers to the Ninth Circuit's opinion on Oracle USA and other rulings from Oracle I, case number 16-16832, Oracle 
USA, Inc. v. Rimini Street, Inc., 879 F.3d 948 (9th Cir. 2018) as ""Rimini I"". "
978,5," As discussed above, supra note 1, the Court shall distinguish between redacted filings and sealed filings with the ""-s"" 
designation. While the filings were sealed to protect the confidential information found within, the Court finds that the public's 
interest in the reasoning behind the Court's order today necessitates citing to the sealed documents. Unless otherwise noted, 
the Court cites to the sealed document for pinpoint citations. "
979,6," Per the Cease and Desist Letter, Rimini's access and use was revoked for ""Oracle's support websites,"" which included, but 
was not limited to, My Oracle Support (support.oracle.com), Oracle Software Delivery Cloud (edelivery.oracle.com), and JD 
Edwards EnterpriseOne and World Update Center (updatecenter.oracle.com). See ECF No. 883-7."
979,7," In Facebook, the Court recognized that the CFAA and the CDAFA differ: the CDAFA ""does not require unauthorized access. It 
merely requires knowing access."" Facebook, 844 F.3d at 1069 (quoting United States v. Christensen, 801 F.3d 970, 994 
(2015)) (emphasis in original). However, the Court held that despite this difference, the analysis remained the same—""when 
Facebook sent the cease and desist letter, Power, as it conceded, knew that it no longer had permission to access Facebook's 
computers at all. Power, therefore, knowingly accessed and without permission took, copied, and made use of Facebook's data,"" 
in violation of the CDAFA. Id. "
981,8, The Court addresses the additional theories of liability later in this Order. See Part IV.D.1.

982,10," Oracle further argues that Rimini's fourth cause of action fails because there is no ""evidence that there has been any actual 
disruption of any contractual obligation—or any other cognizable harm."" ECF Nos. 881, 886-s at 27. The Court declines to 
address Oracle's additional argument because it grants Oracle summary judgment based on the absolute right doctrine. "
984,11," The Court notes that the term ""unfair"" is not defined by the UCL, and as recently as June 2018, the Ninth Circuit commented 
that the definition of the term was in ""flux"" in California state courts. Hodsdon, 891 F.3d at 866 (quoting Davis, 691 F.3d at 1169). "
985,12," As noted above, the Court uses ""Oracle I"" to refer to the entirety of case number 2:10-cv-00106-LRH-VCF and for citations to 
the record in that case. In Oracle I, the Court issued Oracle USA, Inc. v. Rimini Street, Inc., 6 F.Supp.3d 1086, 1096-98 (D. Nev. 
2014), which the Court refers to as ""Oracle USA"". The Ninth Circuit's opinion on Oracle USA and the Oracle I case as a whole, 
Oracle USA, Inc. v. Rimini Street, Inc., 879 F.3d 948 (9th Cir. 2018), is referred to as ""Rimini I""."
985,13," The doctrine of claim-splitting is a ""subspecies"" of claim preclusion. See Finjan, Inc. v. Blue Coat Systems, LLC, 230 
F.Supp.3d 1097, 1102 (N.D. Cal. 2017). "
987,14," As the Court has noted, this decision was affirmed by the Ninth Circuit in Rimini I, 879 F.3d at 959-60. "
988,15," Rimini points to 4 additional licenses that it argues either do not have facilities provisions or the provisions are not substantially 
similar to those ruled on in Oracle I. See ECF No. 974-s at 22. While the provisions identified are not identical, the Court finds 
that each license contains a provision that prohibits local hosting. See ECF No. 896-11 at 6 (under the PNMR Services 
Company's license, a ""Computer license allows you to use the licensed program on a single specified computer."" (emphasis 
added)); ECF No. 896-24-s at 2-3 (under the A.H. Belo Corporation license, copying is limited to ""each Server at the Site up to

998,19, Supra note 18. 
1013,20," The Court's reasoning for granting Oracle's motion regarding Rimini's express license defense is discussed below as it is 
interrelated with Rimini's second motion for partial summary judgment on undisputed processes. See Part IV.G.3."

1021,26," Oracle's fifth motion for summary judgment requested the opposite relief. See ECF No. 930, 941-s. While the Court denies 
Oracle's motion because Rimini's fair use affirmative defense remains, additional arguments made in Oracle's motion are

(11th Cir. 1990))."
1039,13," In their sur-reply, the Plaintiffs argue that ""requiring a customer-plaintiff to plead excluded competitors, would fly in the face of 
the Supreme Court's holding that '[n]either proof of exertion of the power to exclude nor proof of actual exclusion of existing or 
potential competitors is essential to sustain a charge of monopolization under the Sherman Act.'"" (Doc. 54, PageID.372 
(emphasis in original) (quoting Am. Tobacco Co. v. United States, 328 U.S. 781, 810, 66 S. Ct. 1125, 90 L. Ed. 1575 (1946)). 
This argument is meritless. First, American Tobacco concerned criminal antitrust charges brought by the government, rather 
than civil claims by a private actor; therefore, neither ""efficient enforcer"" analysis, nor any other aspect of ""antitrust standing,"" 
was at issue in that case. At most, the foregoing provision means that proof of a ""willing and able competitor"" is not an element 
of an antitrust claim, which does not foreclose it from being a requirement of antitrust standing. See Sunbeam Television, 711 
F.3d at 1270-71 (""In order to recover treble damages, Section Four requires that a private plaintiff enforcing the antitrust laws 
must establish both: (1) that the plaintiff has standing; and, (2) that the defendant has violated the antitrust laws."" (emphasis "
1040,," added)); Cable Holdings, 825 F.2d at 1562 (""Proof of a violation of the Sherman Act standing alone does not establish civil 
liability."" (emphasis added)). Second, long after American Tobacco was decided, the Eleventh Circuit has nevertheless repeatedly held that a plaintiff alleging 
an illegal monopoly must show a ""willing and able competitor"" to be considered an ""efficient enforcer"" with antitrust standing. 
Under the Eleventh Circuit's prior panel precedent rule, binding panel precedent cannot be disregarded until it is overruled or 
abrogated by the Supreme Court or the Eleventh Circuit sitting en banc, even if a court is convinced the ""prior case was wrongly 
decided, ... failed to consider certain critical issues or arguments, ... or ... lacked adequate legal analysis to support its 
conclusions..."" United States v. Lee, 886 F.3d 1161, 1163 & n.3 (11th Cir. 2018) (per curiam) (emphasis added), cert. denied, 
140 S. Ct. 275, 205 L. Ed. 2d 170 (2019). Thus, even if Eleventh Circuit precedent requiring a ""willing and able competitor"" is 
arguably inconsistent with American Tobacco, this Court is not free to disregard that precedent. Moreover, Twombly and Iqbal 
now make clear that a civil complaint must contain sufficient factual allegations plausibly showing that a plaintiff is entitled to 
relief — which requires the plaintiff to show, among other things, that it is an ""efficient enforcer,"" which in turn requires it to 
identify a ""willing and able competitor"" in monopoly antitrust cases."
1040,14," Moreover, as will be explained later, the Plaintiffs have failed to plausibly allege relevant product markets for DTPA and 
Sestamibi, and thus any federal antitrust claims related to those proposed markets are due to be dismissed on that basis as well."

(1962), in opposition to this point is inapposite. The portion of Microsoft Corp. on which the Plaintiffs rely concerned 
demonstrating causation to establish an antitrust violation, while the portion of Continental Ore on which the Plaintiffs rely 
concerned proving an antitrust conspiracy, which the Plaintiffs have not alleged in their complaint. Neither concerned ""efficient 
enforcer"" or ""antitrust standing"" analysis."

from Pharmalucence. (See Doc. 1, PageID.29, ¶¶ 107-108). The Plaintiffs do not rely on those allegations in response to JDI's 
present motion. Regardless, similar to Lantheus, the complaint's allegations indicate that Pharmalucense, rather than JDI, was "
1041,," responsible for thwarting UPPI and its two members' entrance into the MAA market by Pharmalucense, and they fail to plausibly

alleged relevant market products ""is distinguishable in the eyes of radiopharmaceutical manufacturers, radiopharmacies, and 
end-user healthcare professionals"" and ""is not reasonably interchangeable with other products."" (Id., PageID.21, ¶ 68). Such 
conclusory allegations are insufficient on their own to plausibly plead a relevant product market, being reminiscent of the Jacobs 
plaintiffs' unadorned claim ""that '[v]isco-elastic foam mattresses comprise a relevant product market, or sub-market, separate 
and distinct from the market for mattresses generally, under the federal antitrust laws[,]'"" which the Eleventh Circuit found 
insufficient to plausibly allege a product market. 626 F.3d at 1338 (alteration added)."

131 that they claim ""suggest[] these products are preferred by physicians over other products with similar functions[,]"" but not for 
Sestamibi cold kits. (Doc. 50, PageID.322)."
1048,32," The Plaintiffs argue that cross-elasticity of demand should not be a significant factor in determining the relevant product 
markets here because ""this case does not involve the choices of retail consumers looking for ways to part with disposable 
income, but highly technical nuclear diagnostic and treatment products that are prescribed by doctors. Thus, unlike with many 
other types of products, decisions about their use are driven not by the idiosyncratic choices of consumers, or even, absent 
extreme circumstances, by economics; which procedure to administer (and which product to prescribe) is typically determined by 
doctors motivated by addressing the needs of their patients."" (Doc. 50, PageID.319 (record citation omitted) (citing cases)). 
However, the cases cited by the Plaintiffs in support of this proposition reached their respective conclusions that physicians did 
not prescribe one kind of product over another based on price (thus supporting a finding that the products constituted separate 
markets) by relying on specific record evidence establishing that fact. They certainly do not stand for the proposition that such a 
fact should be assumed in all antitrust cases involving doctor-prescribed products, as the Plaintiffs appear to argue. The 
Plaintiffs point to no factual allegations in the complaint to plausibly suggest that doctors would act in such a manner for any of 
the Plaintiffs' claimed relevant market products, and such allegations cannot be supplied by way of the Plaintiffs' briefs in

shrouded by the veil of fraudulent concealment. Neither, however, is protected from the expiration of claims the factual basis for 
which they could and should have discovered through the exercise of due diligence.""). Here, the Plaintiffs do not claim that they were unaware of either the 2013 NDAs acquisition or the 2014 price hikes at the time 
they occurred. Rather, they simply cite to an article from the publication HealthImaging that they attach to their response brief, 
entitled MAA price spike: Jubilant DraxImage address dodges antitrust concern (Doc. 50-1, PageID.334-35) and allegedly 
""written shortly after JDI's first significant price increase of MAA and DTPA"" (Doc. 50, PageID.315 n.8), in which JDI's vice 
president of sales explains away the 2014 price hike as necessary to address ""the cost of manufacturing and utilization per vial 
[going] up and procedure volume [going] down,"" and the ""difficulties of regulatory compliance[,]"" along with an assurance that the 
2014 price hike was ""a one-time, exponential"" occurrence. These statements, however, merely offered alternative explanations 
for JDI's alleged anticompetitive conduct, and had no effect of actually concealing any of it. Indeed, the very title of that article, 
along with its noting that the JDI VP's presentation was made to ""pacify any accusation of wrongdoing on the part of JDI"" (Doc. 
50-1, PageID.334), indicates that the 2014 price hike actually did raise antitrust red flags at the time. In short, the Plaintiffs have 
failed to make even a colorable showing of entitlement to the fraudulent concealment doctrine, and as explained previously, it 
clearly appears from the face of the complaint that any antitrust claims premised on the 2013 NDAs acquisition and the 2014 
price hike are time-barred."
1052,35," JDI, with the Court's leave (see Doc. 37), has submitted a copy of the JDI Master Agreement under seal with its motion to 
dismiss. (See Doc. 34 *SEALED*). Because that document is central to some the Plaintiffs claims, and because the Plaintiffs do 
not dispute its authenticity, the Court can consider it on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. See Speaker v. U.S. Dep't of Health & 
Human Servs. Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, 623 F.3d 1371, 1379 (11th Cir. 2010) (""In ... Rule 12(b)(6) dismissals, 
it is generally true that the scope of the review must be limited to the four corners of the complaint ... This Court, however, has 
recognized an important qualification to this rule where certain documents and their contents are undisputed: In ruling upon a 
motion to dismiss, the district court may consider an extrinsic document if it is (1) central to the plaintiff's claim, and (2) its 
authenticity is not challenged."" (quotations omitted)). "
1053,36," JDI also argues that Count II is deficient because the complaint fails ""to allege the necessary element that the 'tied' products 
that they were allegedly forced to buy—I-131, and MDP and Sestamibi cold kits—are products they did not want, or would have 
purchased elsewhere but for the alleged 'tie.'"" (Doc. 36, PageID.255). However, as JDI's own brief points out, ""the essential 
characteristic of an invalid tying arrangement lies in the seller's exploitation of its control over the tying product to force the buyer 
into the purchase of a tied product that the buyer either did not want at all, or might have preferred to purchase elsewhere on 
different terms."" Jefferson Par. Hosp. Dist. No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 12, 104 S. Ct. 1551, 80 L. Ed. 2d 2 (1984) (emphasis 
added), abrogated on other grounds by Ill. Tool Works Inc. v. Indep. Ink, Inc., 547 U.S. 28, 126 S. Ct. 1281, 164 L. Ed. 2d 26 
(2006). Construed in the light most favorable to the Plaintiffs, the complaint's allegations plausibly suggest that the Plaintiffs at 
least might have preferred to purchase those products elsewhere on different terms."
1053,37," See Collins Inkjet Corp. v. Eastman Kodak Co., 781 F.3d 264, 267 (6th Cir. 2015) (""A tying arrangement can be prohibited 
under § 1 of the Sherman Act even if the tie is not explicit in the seller's contracts, but instead is enforced through informal 
constraints or pricing policies.""); Tic-X-Press, 815 F.2d at 1416-17 (""Where a contract or franchising agreement provides that 
buyers shall use only the seller or a source 'approved' by the seller to purchase the tied product, the courts have looked to see if 
the approval clause was reasonable and permitted the buyer meaningful freedom of choice, or whether it is manipulated by the 
seller to force the buyer to purchase the tied product from the seller ... Although the district court determined that the language of 
the approval clause in this case gave promoters the right to request approval of another ticket agency, it also found that no 
promoter had ever requested permission to use another ticket agency, notwithstanding the approval clause, because they 
understood through years of dealing with TOPCOL and using the Agreement that they were required to use SEATS. 
Furthermore, it also found that the appellants had never approved another ticket agency and that they had never established 
written standards and procedures for approving other agencies. Given these findings, it is reasonable to conclude that the 
approval clause was somewhat bogus under the circumstances present in this case and that promoters did not have meaningful 
freedom of choice in the tied market."" (citations and footnote omitted)). "
1054,38," Count IV also alleges attempted monopolization of the MDP and Sodium Iodine I-131 markets. JDI's ""dangerous probability"" 
arguments do not address those markets. "
1055,39," As the undersigned previously found, all of the Plaintiffs' antitrust claims premised on the Sestamibi product market are also 
due to be dismissed for failure to plausibly allege the contours of that market, and Count IV is also due to be dismissed for failure 
to identify a ""willing and able competitor"" for any relevant market. "
1056,40," Most of the district court opinions that JDI cites in support of its assertion that an unjust enrichment claim must be dismissed at 
the pleading stage if the existence of an express contract is also alleged, fail to acknowledge Rule 8(d) or related authority, and 
none of those cases persuade the undersigned to depart from the plain text of Rule 8(d)(3) permitting a party to plead claims 
""regardless of consistency."""
1056,41," Accord, e.g., Rosenberg v. Gould, 554 F.3d 962, 967 (11th Cir. 2009); My24HourNews.com, Inc. v. AT&T Corp., 791 Fed.

request in the memorandum filed in opposition to AT&T's motion to dismiss. Even assuming that request was the functional 
equivalent of a motion, My24 failed to attach the proposed amendment or set forth the substance of the proposed amendment, 
as required by Long ... My24 simply requested 'leave to amend to cure any defects.' That is not enough, and the district court 
acted within its discretion by denying the embedded request for amendment.""); Avena v. Imperial Salon & Spa, Inc., 740 F. 
App'x 679, 683 (11th Cir. 2018) (per curiam) (unpublished) (""Here, the only request Avena made for leave to file an amended 
complaint prior to the district court's dismissal of her complaint was a single line at the end of her motion in opposition to 
Imperial's motion to dismiss. This request was improper because it neither contained a proposed amendment, nor did it 
elaborate on the substance of the proposed amendment."")."
1056,42," Undercutting the possibility that the Plaintiffs have any new material information to add to the complaint is the fact that they did 
not take advantage of the opportunity to amend their complaint once as a matter of course under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 
15(a)(1)(B) to at least attempt to address any of the myriad issues raised in JDI's motion. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a) advisory 
committee's note to 2009 amendment (Under Rule 15(a), ""the right to amend once as a matter of course terminates 21 days 
after service of a motion under Rule 12(b), (e), or (f). This provision will force the pleader to consider carefully and promptly the 
wisdom of amending to meet the arguments in the motion. A responsive amendment may avoid the need to decide the motion or 
reduce the number of issues to be decided, and will expedite determination of issues that otherwise might be raised seriatim. It 
also should advance other pretrial proceedings.""). "
1068,1," For purposes of this memorandum and order, the Court refers to docket entries in FWK, et al. v. Shire, et al., 16-cv-12653 as 
""FWK [ECF No.]"" and docket entries in Picone, et al. v. Shire, et al., 16-cv-12396 as ""Picone [ECF No.]."""
1068,2," On September 11, 2020, the Court granted the DPPs' motion for preliminary approval of its proposed settlement with Actavis. 
[FWK 493]. That settlement does not resolve the Plaintiffs' claims against Shire or the IPPs' claims against Actavis."
1068,3," The motions for summary judgment were filed by the DPPs but were subsequently joined by the IPPs. [Picone 237; Picone 
238]. "
1069,4," Shire abandoned the '290 Patent in March 2012. [FWK 380-1 ¶ 27; FWK 374-1 ¶ 19]. Plaintiffs maintain that the patent was 
abandoned because it was revealed, during the underlying litigation, that the '290 Patent was invalidated by prior art. [FWK 380-
1 ¶ 27; FWK 374-1 ¶ 19]."
1069,5," The '599 Patent describes extended-release formulations that release the drug over time, rather than immediately. [FWK 280-1 
¶ 28]. It is set to expire on December 20, 2020, but has pediatric exclusivity until June 20, 2021. [Id.; FWK 374-1 ¶ 4]."
1069,6," The '794 Patent claims a method of treating Attention Deficit Disorder and ADHD by administering a guanfacine or guanfacine 
H1 drug and reducing side effects that are often associated with guanfacine HC1. [FWK 280-1 ¶ 28]. It is set to expire on July 4, 
2022, but has pediatric exclusivity until January 4, 2023. [Id.; FWK 374-1 ¶ 4]. "
1070,7," Specifically, the proposal provided that Shire's 60% royalty would decline to 25%, if Actavis was on the market with one other 
generic or AG, and to 15% if there was more than one other generic alternative. [FWK 380-1 ¶ 49]. "
1071,8," That provision provided: [T]he License and Authorization shall become exclusive on the effective date of the Amendment with respect to AG 
Product, even as to Shire . . . if Shire's grant of such exclusive license contemplated by this Section becomes Permitted by 
Law in the Territory. As used in this section, the term ""Permitted by Law"" shall mean federal Law as interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court or 
enacted by Congress and which federal Law preempts application of any state or local Law to Shire's grant of the exclusive 
license contemplated by this Section. For avoidance of any doubt, as of the Effective Date and unless amended as contemplated by this Section, the License and 
Authorization is non-exclusive as to Shire's right itself or through an Affiliate to Market an AG Product as provided in 
Section 2.3 [FWK 380-1 ¶ 67]. "
1072,9," Regarding termination of royalties, the Agreement specifies that ""[f]or the avoidance of doubt, this royalty obligation is 
terminated on the date of the First Commercial Sale by a Third Party or Shire or its Affiliates of a Generic Equivalent Product or 
an AG Product in the Territory, so that [Actavis] will owe no royalty on [Actavis] Generic Products sold by [Actavis] after such

1087,12," Though the DPPs filed the motion, [FWK 295], the IPPs subsequently joined, [Picone 237]. "
1089,13," Other courts, however, have been more lenient and have held that a plaintiff need not demonstrate that the patent would have 
been found invalid or that an at-risk launch would not have infringed on said patent. E.g., Lidoderm, 296 F. Supp. 3d at 1155. 
Those courts have found that ""consideration of whether the agreement is justified as procompetitive will not turn on whether the 
patent would ultimately have been proved valid or invalid,"" because ""[a]greements must be assessed as of the time they are 
made . . . at which point the patent's validity is unknown and unknowable."" Id. (quoting In re Cipro Cases I and II, 61 Cal. 4th

1102,3," AAPS argues that ""[e]ach hospital almost always has market power in its community, as do insurance companies within their 
respective States."" [55] at 9-10. Even if AAPS could proceed on a theory that ABMS conspired with entities nationwide to 
restrain trade in most or all localized markets for physician care, this conclusory statement about market power is far too general 
to support AAPS's proposed market definition. "
1103,4," The opinion in Oral Implantology was issued after the parties finished briefing this motion but involves a similar analysis about 
the lack of restraint in the professional certification context. "
1104,5," ABMS did not directly challenge the allegations supporting the alleged agreement until its reply brief. However, AAPS 
addressed the alleged conspiracy in its response brief, so it is appropriate to reach the issue. See Carver v. Nall, 172 F.3d 513, 
515 (7th Cir. 1999) (""specifically address[ing]"" point in response brief not raised in opening constitutes waiver of forfeiture 
argument). "
1109,1," Although the Court reserved time for a further hearing after the submission of the supplemental papers, the Court vacated the 
hearing after receiving the supplemental papers. (See Aug. 13, 2020 Order, 7; Sept. 3, 2020 Order, 1-2.) "
1110,2," These sources and the Baltimore Police case were also in the tentative ruling the Court provided to the parties in advance of 
the August 12, 2020 continued hearing. "
1111,3," See Veronica Root, Constraining Monitors, 85 Fordham L. Rev. 2227, 2228-29 (2017) [in seeking appointment as a monitor, 
the stakes are quite high]."
1111,4," First, for preliminary approval purposes the Court is persuaded that the consideration given for the release is within the range 
of reasonableness. Second, the Court has not through the preliminary approval proceedings identified potential stumbling blocks 
in the consent decree, aside from the appointment of the monitor, that preclude preliminary approval."
1111,5," Ms. Lomax declared that when Ms. Ward contacted her about submitting a response to a request for proposal, Ms. Lomax felt 
that without access to sufficient resources she was not able to submit her own proposal. (Aug. 24, 2020 Lomax Decl. ¶ 2.) "
1112,," Accordingly, when Mr. Caplan contacted Ms. Lomax the next day about serving as a consultant in connection with his bid, which 
was backed by the track record and infrastructure of Affiliated Monitors, Inc., Ms. Lomax decided to join Mr. Caplan's bid 
because it was the best way for her to participate in the matter. (Id. at ¶ 3.) If appointed, the monitor is empowered to hire staff to 
carry out its assignment. (Jan. 30, 2020 Johnson Decl., Ex. B at Art. 1, § 1.1.) Based on Ms. Lomax's experience, the Court is 
confident that given time Ms. Lomax could have assembled a capable support team, the ""resources"" Ms. Lomax appears to 
have been lacking when she was contacted. But Ms. Lomax was not given time — she was invited to apply just before the 
application deadline, apparently after, as a result of outreach to six other individuals, five other applications had already been 
solicited."
1112,6, The record does not reveal the race of the sixth candidate solicited but not interviewed by the parties. 
1113,7," As a practical matter, the Court sees no need to file two motions. The appointment of a monitor is a term of the settlement. 
Accordingly, the Court will necessarily need to decide whether to appoint a monitor as one component of the settlement approval 
process. If Plaintiffs prefer to file two motions, they may do so."
1113,8," The Court is aware that the parties here are being required to expend considerable effort addressing the monitor appointment 
which, based on argument made during prior hearings, they have not been required to do in the past. But the Court is mindful, 
particularly this week, that ""[r]eal change, enduring change, happens one step at a time."" "
1147,1," Judge Phipps would have accepted this argument and held we have jurisdiction because the patent-law issues the FTC's 
sham-litigation theory presents are not substantial."
1147,2," It might be argued the patent-law issues Gunn presented are less substantial than the ones we face here because the patent 
litigation in Gunn led to the patent's invalidation, see id. at 255, whereas the '894 patent has not been invalidated. Indeed, while 
the '894 patent expired on August 30, 2020, AbbVie and Besins may sue for infringement for up to six years after that date. See 
35 U.S.C. § 286. We think this distinction is immaterial under Gunn, which emphasized that state-court adjudication of the legal 
malpractice claim would not change the result of the prior federal patent litigation, rather than emphasizing the result itself. See 
568 U.S. at 261. "
1161,3," In a footnote in its response brief, the FTC challenges the District Court's requirement of proof by clear-and-convincing 
evidence. We have not decided what standard of proof applies to sham litigation's subjective motivation prong. Cf. Wellbutrin, 
868 F.3d at 148 n.18 (referencing the objective baselessness prong). But in discussing Noerr-Pennington cases involving 
Section 1983 claims, we have explained that a higher standard of proof is needed in Noerr-Pennington cases involving patent 
disputes. See Campbell v. Pa. Sch. Bds. Ass'n, 972 F.3d 213, 2020 U.S. App. LEXIS 27338, 2020 WL 5049051, at *7 (3d Cir. 
2020). We need not adopt that dicta today because HN55[
] ""arguments raised in passing (such as, in a footnote), but not "
1162,," squarely argued,"" are forfeited on appeal. John Wyeth & Bro. Ltd. v. CIGNA Intern. Corp., 119 F.3d 1070, 1076 n.6 (3d Cir. 
1997)."
1162,4," AbbVie and Besins argue the District Court erred by not considering the business planning documents and settlement 
agreements. The FTC argues the Court erred by not considering Solvay's 2009 press release. The Court correctly concluded 
that none of this evidence is probative of the decisionmakers' subjective motivations. "
1176,1," The U.S. Supreme Court held in California v. ARC America Corp. that Illinois Brick repealer statutes are not preempted by the

Ct. 1661, 104 L. Ed. 2d 86 (1989). "
1177,2," The Court declines to give Spinner v. BMS any preclusive effect. Since the Third Circuit affirmed the district court's result on 
grounds other than Illinois Brick, the district court's reasoning cannot be said to be ""necessary to support a valid and final 
judgment on the merits."" Transaero, Inc. v. La Fuerza Aerea Boliviana, 162 F.3d 724, 731 (2d Cir. 1998); see also Indus. Risk

1196,6," Examples of “very commercial” films include the franchises Star Wars, X-Men, and Mission: Impossible, as well as Pixar films."
1196,7," The Palme's business plan therefore called for “a collection of main titles” that were “supplement[ed] in the other screens … 
with titles that people weren't very familiar with,” including independent and foreign films. “[D]uring the trailers” for first-run 
commercial movies, the Palme “would show all the other films [it was] screening at the theatre.” "
1198,8," Flagship does not argue that such multi-film licensing agreements (as opposed to multi-theater agreements) constitute a form 
of circuit dealing, nor would such an argument find support in the current law."
1198,9," This case came before this court on two occasions before proceeding to trial. First, in 2011, we reversed the trial court's initial 
summary judgment ruling in Century's favor based on the sufficiency of the evidence to establish antitrust injury. We further held 
that “the court [had] abused its discretion by making discovery rulings that impermissibly curtailed Flagship's efforts to gather 
evidence of circuit dealing” outside the Coachella Valley, and reversed the summary judgment ruling on this basis as well. 
(Flagship, supra, 198 Cal.App.4th at p. 1383.) After further discovery, the case was dismissed in 2014 on the eve of trial based 
on a spoliation issue. In 2016, we reversed that ruling (see Flagship Theatres of Palm Desert v. Century Theatres, Inc. (May 24, 
2016, B257148) [nonpub. opn.]), and the case ultimately proceeded to trial in 2018. "
1199,10," The court identified as the elements of a nonmonopoly circuit-dealing claim that: (1) Century “was a dominant theatre circuit”; 
(2) Century “pooled its purchasing power to enter into licensing agreements for specific films that included multiple theatres, 
including, at least, [T]he River and one or more other theatres”; (3) “by entering into such multiple theatre licensing agreements, 
the film distributors were precluded from determining on a theatre-by-theatre basis which theatres would be licensed for a 
particular film, thereby eliminating the opportunity for the small competitor to obtain the choice first[-]runs”; (4) “[p]laintiff was in 
fact precluded from competing for first[-]run films as a result of [Century] entering into multiple theatre licensing agreements”; 
and (5) plaintiff suffered damages as a result."
1199,11," Although the latter additional instruction did not specifically state that the harm must occur in a defined relevant market, the 
special verdict form required a finding to this effect."
1199,12," The jury was instructed that the elements of such a claim were that: (1) Century “possessed sufficient market power outside 
the market where the Palme and [T]he River competed”; (2) Century “used its market power by communicating to a film 
distributor that [Century] will not exhibit the distributor's films in [Century] theatres outside the market where the Palme and [T]he 
River competed in order to coerce the distributor to allocate films exclusively to [T]he River rather than the Palme”; (3) this “use 
of its market power caused a film distributor to agree to license first[-]run films exclusively to [T]he River, rather than to the 
Palme, in a manner contrary to the film distributor's own best interest and that prevents the licensing of films theatre by theatre”; 
and (4) plaintiff suffered damages as a result."
1199,13," The jury verdict form references harm to competition in the form of either increased prices or reduced output, and does not 
require the jury to indicate which it found to be true. All parties acknowledge, however, that Flagship has never argued a price 
effect, and that no evidence regarding pricing was presented at trial. We therefore focus solely on the output restriction language 
in the jury's finding. "
1200,14," Flagship also argues that, even if the rule of reason applies, substantial evidence supports the jury's findings under the rule of 
reason as well. We address these arguments in the Discussion post, part II. "
1202,15," Flagship neither alleged, nor offered any evidence suggesting, that there was a broader hub-and-spoke conspiracy between 
and among the distributors, or that any of the distributors was vertically integrated with any exhibitor entity. Rather, Flagship's 
theory involved multiple agreements, each between one distributor and Century, which is neither owned nor controlled by any 
distributor. "
1204,16," “The extreme example of a deficiency of interbrand competition is monopoly, where there is only one manufacturer. In 
contrast, intrabrand competition is the competition between the distributors—wholesale or retail—of the product of a particular 
manufacturer. [¶] The degree of intrabrand competition is wholly independent of the level of interbrand competition confronting 
the manufacturer. Thus, there may be fierce intrabrand competition among the distributors of a product produced by a 
monopolist and no intrabrand competition among the distributors of a product produced by a firm in a highly competitive industry. 
But when interbrand competition exists, as it does among television manufacturers, it provides a significant check on the 
exploitation of intrabrand market power because of the ability of consumers to substitute a different brand of the same product.” 
(Sylvania, supra, 433 U.S. at p. 52, fn. 19.) "
1205,17," Although NYNEX acknowledged the possibility that a vertical agreement restricting price might warrant per se treatment, the 
court has since held that vertical agreements regarding resale prices are also subject to the rule of reason, and for largely the 
same reasons that nonprice vertical restraints are. (See Leegin, supra, 551 U.S. at pp. 890–894.) "
1206,18," We do not discuss some of the Sherman Act cases Flagship cites that predate the significant changes in federal antitrust law 
(and, in some cases, the significant changes in the film industry) outlined in the Discussion ante, part I.C.1., and thus are not 
instructive. (See Beech Cinema v. Twentieth Century-Fox Film (2d Cir. 1980) 622 F.2d 1106; Columbia Pictures Corp. v. 
Charles Rubenstein, Inc. (8th Cir. 1961) 289 F.2d 418; Fox West Coast Theatres Corp. v. Paradise Theatre Building Corp. (9th 
Cir. 1958) 264 F.2d 602; Bordonaro Bros. Theatres v. Paramount Pictures (2d Cir. 1949) 176 F.2d 594.) Moreover, none of 
these cases addresses the correct analytical framework for circuit-dealing claims, but rather various other issues not directly 
relevant to this appeal, such as the sufficiency of evidence supporting the existence of the conspiracy alleged."
1206,19," The parties raised this issue in Flagship. (Flagship, supra, 198 Cal.App.4th at p. 1386.) At the time, however, they had not 
briefed all the legal issues relevant to deciding which antitrust analytical framework applied, and the record was insufficient to 
determine the exact nature of Flagship's circuit-dealing claims. (Id. at pp. 1386–1387.) We noted that “[t]he type of circuit[-
]dealing claim at issue might influence the analysis of whether the per se rule or the rule of reason should apply,” in that it “might 
make certain authorities or analogies more relevant than others,” and declined to decide the issue. (Ibid.)"
1206,20," In Cobb, the defendants did argue in their reply brief that the rule of reason, rather than a per se analysis, applied to all circuit-
dealing claims, but the court did not address the argument except to note that “[d]efendants suggest that circuit dealing should "
1207,," be scrutinized under the rule of reason. Even if that were true, the [c]ourt's analysis here would not change.” (Cobb, supra, 101 
F.Supp.3d at p. 1343.) "
1208,21," For this same reason, in the wake of NYNEX, we do not find Flagship's citation to Movie 1 & 2 v. United Artists 
Communications (9th Cir. 1990) 909 F.2d 1245 to be persuasive authority for the proposition that nonhorizontal “group boycotts 
that directly or indirectly cut off necessary access to customers or suppliers” are per se Sherman Act violations. (Movie 1 & 2, at 
p. 1253.) Movie 1 & 2 is also inapposite in that it involved a boycott with horizontal components. (Id. at p. 1248 [distributor 
defendants alleged to have concertedly refused to deal with plaintiff theater and to have assisted with a split agreement between 
one distributor defendant and a theater defendant].) "
1210,22," The idea that licenses for first-run films are interchangeable products—or, for that matter, that tickets to view first-run films are 
interchangeable products—is counterintuitive, given that there may be significant differences between any given first-run film 
and another. In concrete terms, it is hard to understand how the right to exhibit, or the right to view, an R-rated action movie is 
interchangeable with the right to exhibit or view a G-rated animated film. Given the role of first-run films as a group in the 
economics of the movie theater business, however, movie theater industry cases appear to have accepted this concept, and the 
parties do not challenge it here. "
1212,23," Nor do the antitrust laws view this as inherently anticompetitive—rather, in order for a clearance to violate the antitrust laws, a 
plaintiff must show something beyond the inherent limitations a clearance places on the number of film licenses granted for a 
particular film in a particular area. “[T]he reasonableness of a clearance under section 1 of the Sherman Act depends on the 
competitive stance of the theaters involved and the clearance's effect on competition, especially the interbrand competition … .” 
(Orson, supra, 79 F.3d at p. 1372; see Tarzana, supra, 828 F.2d at p. 1399 [clearances “are reasonable if they are likely to 
promote interbrand competition without overly restricting intrabrand competition”].) The Ninth Circuit has identified the following 
factors for the purposes of analyzing the competitive effects of a clearance beyond the inherent limitation on the number of 
licenses awarded in the clearance zone: (1) “the proximity of the theaters”; (2) “the location of theaters with respect to major 
thoroughfares”; (3) “whether transportation barriers exist between the theaters”; (4) “whether the plaintiff theater bid on the 
clearances”; (5) “whether the plaintiff acknowledged that his theater was substantially competitive with the defendant”; (6) 
“whether the theaters drew customers from the same geographical area”; and (7) “whether the theaters advertised throughout 
the same geographical area.” (Soffer, supra, 1996 WL 194947 at p. *4, citing Tarzana, supra, 828 F.2d at p. 1399.) "

1223,1," We refer to the FTC acting in its role as complaint counsel as the ""FTC"" and the FTC acting in its adjudicatory capacity as the 
""Commission."" "
1224,2," The Board also argues we lack jurisdiction over the merits of the FTC's appeal, but because the district court lacked 
jurisdiction, we do not address the merits. See Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona, 520 U.S. 43, 73, 117 S. Ct. 1055, 1072, 
137 L. Ed. 2d 170 (1997) (recognizing that when a district court ""lack[s] jurisdiction, we have jurisdiction on appeal, not of the 
merits but merely for the purpose of correcting the error of the lower court in entertaining the [matter]"")."
1224,3," Other circuits concur. See, e.g., Chehazeh v. Attorney Gen., 666 F.3d 118, 135 (3d Cir. 2012) (""A provision analogous to 
Section 704's 'final agency action' requirement is found in 28 U.S.C. § 1291, which permits appellate review only of 'final 
decisions' of a district court.""); DRG Funding Corp. v. Sec'y of Hous. & Urban Dev., 76 F.3d 1212, 1220 (D.C. Cir. 1996) 
(Ginsburg, J., concurring) (""Our analysis of the finality requirement imposed by the APA is properly informed by our analysis of 
that requirement in § 1291.""). "
1225,4," Note that this is a significant theoretical stretch, as it (a) means the appeal to the district court of an interlocutory order under

1225,5," HN7[

only under the FTC Act). We also note that, although ""the state action doctrine is often labeled an immunity, that term is actually 
a misnomer because the doctrine is but a recognition of the limited reach of the Sherman Act . . . ."" Acoustic Sys., 207 F.3d at 
292 n.3. Consistent with our prior opinions, however, we continue to refer to the doctrine as one of immunity. See generally

1227,7," The Board relies perfunctorily on a finality test articulated in Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 117 S. Ct. 1154, 137 L. Ed. 2d 281 
(1997). HN17[
] Bennett pronounced two conditions that ""must be satisfied for an agency action to be 'final'"": (1) the action 
must ""mark the consummation of the agency's decision making process,"" and (2) the action must be that ""by which rights or 
obligations have been determined or from which legal consequences will flow."" 520 U.S. at 177-78, 117 S. Ct. at 1168. The 
Board argues that the April 10, 2018 order is ""independently reviewable as a 'final' order under the test articulated in Bennett"" 
because the order ""reflects a consummation of the decision making process"" from which ""legal consequences will flow, including 
[the Board's] legal right to immunity from trial."" This is incorrect. Not only is the Board not entitled to immunity from suit, but the 
Commission's denial of state action immunity will affect the Board adversely only if the Commission ultimately finds the Board 
liable for antitrust violations. Put differently, the April 10, 2018 order ""does not itself adversely affect [the Board] but only affects 
[its] rights adversely on the contingency of future administrative action."" Am. Airlines, 176 F.3d at 288 (quoting Rochester Tel. 
Corp. v. United States, 307 U.S. 125, 130, 59 S. Ct. 754, 757, 83 L. Ed. 1147 (1939)). The April 10, 2018 order does not 
constitute final agency action under Bennett. "
1237,1," The Court's consideration of these declarations on a motion to dismiss is proper. Whether a claim is moot goes to a court's 
subject matter jurisdiction, see [**25]  Ruvalcaba v. City of Los Angeles, 167 F.3d 514, 521 (9th Cir. 1999), and, therefore, a 
motion to dismiss based on mootness is brought as a 12(b)(1) motion, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1). ""Unlike a Rule 12(b)(6) 
motion, a Rule 12(b)(1) motion can attack the substance of a complaint's jurisdictional allegations despite their formal

1239,2," The Court notes that despite Wong's contention, Opp'n at 5 (""The Athletics held Plaintiff Wong's money for nine months before

based on when Wong bought the tickets but rather when the alleged conspiracy began. See West Virginia v. United States, 479 
U.S. 305, 310 n.2, 107 S. Ct. 702, 93 L. Ed. 2d 639 (1987) (""Prejudgment interest serves to compensate for the loss of use of

1262,7," Epic Games disputes that its use of the hotfix was deceptive where it is common practice in the gaming and software industry. 
The deceptive conduct does not derive from Epic Games' use of the hotfix specifically, but from using a hotfix to clandestinely 
add features in violation of the guidelines and its agreements with Apple, and then failing to disclose such code. Moreover, Epic 
Games did this despite receiving an unambiguous refusal from Apple only a few weeks prior to the introduction of its hotfix. The 
record further reflects that while hotfixes are commonly used in the industry, their uses are generally to fix or patch critical bugs 
or defects—not to enact substantive and significant new features. Epic Games' adamant refusal to understand this basic 
distinction is not only baffling, but undermines its credibility with this Court."
1262,8, Modeled presumably on Mr. Cook's likeness. 
1263,9," The record also reflects that Apple made moves in early September to cancel Epic Games' ability to use the Sign in with Apple

1266,13," Epic Games' economic expert does not address these factors; instead, he principally relies on the those that follow."
1266,14," The parties are reminded that Newcal was decided on a motion to dismiss and has limited reach. The Ninth Circuit explicitly 
indicated that the case is not ""guarantee[d]"" to survive a motion for summary judgment because the ""actual existence of a 
separate economic entity (i.e. a submarket) that includes only IKON's customers is a factual question."" 513 F.3d at 1051. The 
same is true of Teradata and Psystar. The Court relies on each for those limited propositions. "
1267,15," Both Epic Games and Apple agree, however, that the ""geographic market"" is likely global. (But see Evans Decl. at 10 n.37 
(Dkt. No. 62 at 12) (reserving future opinion on whether the Chinese mobile market should be included in the geographic 
market).) "
1268,16," Apple fails to respond adequately to the ""aftermarket"" theory, devoting a single paragraph to it and stating, in a conclusory 
fashion, that ""this is not an aftermarket case."" Should Epic Games continue to assert this theory, Apple should explain why 
switching and information costs do not render the IOS app distribution market distinct. HN18[
] Silence can be interpreted as 
an admission."
1268,17," Apple further avers that as intellectual property owner, even if it is a monopolist, Apple is not required to allow unfettered and 
uncompensated use of its own technology. See Herbert Hovenkamp et al., IP and Antitrust: An Analysis of Antitrust Principles 
Applied to Intellectual Property Law § 13.03 (3rd ed., 2016 & Supp. 2019) (citing Microsoft Corp., 253 F.3d at 63-64). That said, 
HN19[
] ""intellectual property rights do not confer a privilege to violate the antitrust laws."" Microsoft, 253 F.3d at 64. Moreover, the parties fail to brief whether Apple possesses ""essential facilities,"" which may require (compensated) access. The Court 
makes no express finding on these issues, but notes these as other potential hurdles."
1268,18," The Court also leaves for another day the proper classification of the 30% at issue, that is, whether it is a commission, a 
licensing fee, a ""tax"", or a ""price."" Each may have legal ramifications which have not been fully briefed, and therefore carry with 
them unintended consequences of choosing a term too quickly."
1268,19," However, the Court notes that Apple's argument assumes a user who owns multiple devices, pays attention to prices for in-
app purchases, and switches devices in response to price increases. There is little evidence that the ordinary iOS consumer 
carries such characteristics. Cf. U.S. v. Engelhard Corp., 126 F.3d 1302, 1306 (11th Cir. 1997) (rejecting relevant market 
analysis based on customer interviews where proponent failed to show that the customers were representative). "
1270,20," HN23[
] Section 1 of the Sherman Act broadly prohibits ""[e]very contract, combination . . ., or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States."" 15 U.S.C. § 1. The term ""restraint of trade"" has been limited to ""undue"" (unreasonable) 
restrains. Amex, 138 S.Ct. at 2283."
1270,21," As explained in Jefferson Parish, HN25[
] ""the essential characteristic of an invalid tying arrangement lies in the seller's 
exploitation of its control over the tying product to force the buyer into the purchase of a tied product that the buyer either did not 
want at all, or might have preferred to purchase elsewhere on different terms."" 466 U.S. at 12. Per se condemnation is only 
appropriate where such forcing is ""probable."" Id. at 15. "
1272,22," Epic Games' Best Buy and QuickBooks analogy misses the mark. Epic Games stated: [W]hat Apple wants to do is to have the consumer go in to Best Buy, buy the Quick[B]ooks . . . pay for it [**41]  there, that's 
fine. That's the app distribution. But then take it home, and every time you do your taxes or every time you close your books 
using Quick[B]ooks, after you have the product, to keep paying Best Buy every single time another 30 percent. They are 
reaching into subsequent transactions."" (Dkt. No. 50 at 50-51.) With respect to video games, however, at least two significant distinctions exist. First, at a brick-and-
mortar store, games were not distributed for free; that is, free-to-play games like Fortnite did not exist. In the digital context, 
consumers can obtain some games for free, and, under the license, no payment from Epic Games to Apple is due in that 
transaction. Second, an analogous pre-digital marketplace transaction exists: namely, the sale of expansion packs, which could unlock 
additional content for base version of games, including new gameplay mechanics and functions. Consumers would initially 
purchase the base game from a brick-and-mortar store. Assuming the expansion pack was not available at the time of purchase 
of the base game, consumers were thereafter required to return to a store to purchase in a separate transaction the expansion 
pack—thereby unlocking this additional content in the base game. IAP appears to operate analogously: the base version of a game is required to play, but IAP similarly unlocks additional content 
including new gameplay mechanics and functions. These analogous pre-digital transactions suggest that IAP is not merely a 
payment processor, as Epic Games contends, but rather an integrated part of the digital marketplace, permitting a prior historical 
business model in the gaming industry. The Court highlights that neither party discusses these analogous transactions, but the 
Court discloses that this conceptual similarity further colors the Court's analysis, including the need for a more complete record. 
See also Amex, 138 S. Ct. at 2286-87 (discussing a transaction platform like the App Store, noting that it ""facilitate[s] a single, 
simultaneous transaction between"" two parties)."
1272,23," Indeed, it is the Court's understanding that all video game digital distribution marketplaces require a consumer to similarly 
return to the marketplace to complete an IAP."
1272,24," The Court notes that the conceptualization of the IAP system as integrated within the App Store may generally defeat a per se 
analysis. Microsoft suggests that perhaps the appropriate lens to view a tying claim involving innovative technological business 
models is under the rule of reason analysis, not under a per se tying analysis. See Microsoft, 253 F.3d 34 at 89-95, 346 U.S. 
App. D.C. 330."
1272,25," The question of perspective underlies the tying claim as much as the monopolization claim. In Rick-Mik, the court found that 
""[t]he relevant 'purchaser' is the franchisee (not the general consumer)"" for purposes of separate demand for credit card 
processing services. 532 F.3d at 975. Here, the equivalent of the franchisee is the developer, which may demonstrate stronger 
""separate demand"" for payment processing services than the user who makes the purchases. "
1273,26," Epic Games shows that at least some developers have demanded separate payment processing services based on these 
features, independent of Apple's 30%. For example, Epic Games claims the CEO of the company ""Hey,"" which provides email 
service, made the following statement months before Epic Games' motion: [A]s the owner of a business, this isn't just about money. Money grabs the headlines, but there's a far more elemental story 
here. It's about the absence of choice, and how Apple forcibly inserts themselves between your company and your 
customer. [**43]  . . . When Apple forces companies to offer In App Purchases in order to be on their platform, they also dictate the limits to 
which you can help your customer. This has a detrimental impact on the customer experience, and your relationship with 
your customer. It can flat out ruin an interaction, damage your reputation, and it can literally cost you customers. It prevents 
us from providing exceptional customer service when someone who uses our product needs help. (Evans Reply Decl. ¶ 45 & n.40 (Dkt. No. 88).) This statement suggests that the IAP dispute is not simply about Apple's fee, but 
also about whether ""the world's largest company [gets] to decide how millions of other businesses can interact with their own 
customers."" See Jason Fried, ""Our CEO's take on Apple's App Store payment policies, and their impact on our relationship with 
our customers,"" HEY (June 19, 2020), available at https://hey.com/apple/iap/."
1273,27," Commentators have suggested that separate demand is a ""threshold requirement"" for separate products, following which 
defendant may show that the products are nevertheless a single product due to their being an ""integrated service."" See Philip E. 
Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law: An Analysis of Antitrust Principles and Their Application ¶ 1743 (4th Ed. 2020). 
United States v. Microsoft Corp., 147 F.3d 935, 948-49, 331 U.S. App. D.C. 121 (D.C. Cir. 1998), lays out the general 
requirements for an integrated service. "
1274,28," Nevertheless, for the same reasons as described for separate demand under the per se analysis, the Court can envision a 
plausible case for anticompetitive effect given the serious questions referenced above regarding Apple's IAP restrictions and 
whether they reduce consumer choice or increase price due to exclusionary conduct. See Qualcomm, 969 F.3d at 990. 
Competitors could conceivably provide equal or superior services than IAP—better security, better customer service, and better 
parental controls. Moreover, Epic Games may be able to prove anticompetitive effects even if it cannot show separate products: 
Microsoft suggests that the separate-products test ""is a rough proxy for whether a tying arrangement may [be] . . . unsuited to 
per se condemnation,"" not a determination of ultimate efficiency. 253 F.3d at 87. "
1275,29," Epic Games' citation to Acquaire v. Canada Dry Bottling Co., 24 F.3d 401 (2d Cir. 1994) is markedly distinguishable. As Apple 
correctly notes, Acquaire involved a defendant who made after-the-fact changes to its policies, did not even comply with its own 
stated policy, and the plaintiffs made a showing that they would be driven out of business absent an injunction. Id. at 412. None 
of these facts are present, where Apple has maintained the same policies since the inception of the App Store, and there is no 
evidence in the record that Epic Games will be driven out of business based on the unavailability of Fortnite on the iOS platform."
1275,30," Even reviewing the record before the Court, the Court is not persuaded that Epic Games has suffered reputational harm. Epic 
Games unleashed a pre-planned and scorching marketing campaign against Apple following its breach of the operating 
agreements and guidelines. As the Court noted at oral arguments, if anything, it appears Epic Games' actions have only 
increased its reputation in the wider community."
1275,31," It is further difficult to conceive how Epic Games' own ongoing ambitions in the creation of a metaverse would create a basis 
for a finding of irreparable injury. "
1276,32," Indeed, Second City Music is illustrative for why Epic Games' actions cannot constitute irreparable harm. In Second City 
Music, the plaintiff-appellant challenged a city ordinance as unconstitutionally vague—not merely violative of a statutory regime. 
333 F.3d at 847. The Seventh Circuit found that ""some real injury may lurk beneath the surface . . . but evaluating this possibility 
requires evidence so far missing from the record."" Id. at 850. Likewise, as discussed, the record here is inadequate for the Court 
to conclude that the agreements and guidelines are violative of antitrust laws such that Epic Games truly has irreparable harm 
as to Fortnite."
1276,33," As made apparent at the oral argument, Apple's form letter purportedly banning Epic Games from the iOS platform for a one-
year period is no barrier to Epic Games' return to the iOS platform during the pendency of this litigation. (Dkt. No. 111 at 83-84.) 
As Apple stated at the hearing, Epic Games is able to return to the App Store under the Court's supervision provided that Epic 
Games complies with the relevant agreements and guidelines and further pays Apple its commission on the IAP that occurred 
after the breach on August 13, 2020. (Id.)"
1276,34," Epic Games' argument that people are incorrectly blaming Epic Games for the unavailability of Fortnite on the iOS platform 
ignores the record in this matter. The decision of whether to return Fortnite to the iOS platform during the pendency of this 
litigation rests with Epic Games—not Apple. Indeed, Epic Games has a choice, and it has exercised this choice by weighing its 
own beliefs and principles as to the alleged illegality of the Apple agreements and guidelines above its interest in continuing to 
provide iOS users with access to Fortnite. As noted, Epic Games is free to make that choice; but it is Epic Games' choice 
nonetheless. "
1278,35," Further, to do so would be tactically disastrous for Epic Games and its affiliates as it would prove Apple's point with respect to 
its need to maintain its walled garden or closed platform to protect iOS consumers against security attacks. Moreover, Apple's arguments—that Mr. Sweeney's statements to Apple announcing the breach reflect a risk to the iOS 
platform—do not persuade. Mr. Sweeney states that should Apple reject its demands for the ability to introduce a separate app 
market and use a different payment processor, then Epic Games will be in conflict with Apple on ""a multitude of fronts - creative, 
technical, business, and legal - for so long as it takes to bring about change."" (Sweeney Decl., Ex. D (Dkt. No. 65-4).) These 
statements appear hyperbolic, but even a generous reading in Apple's favor does not reflect any intent to harm the iOS platform 
with respect to the Unreal Engine or the other applications that are under other affiliates' developer accounts. Indeed, Unreal 
Engine does not even utilize the App Store or itself offer IAP, as it is a graphics engine available to developers on computer 
platforms. It is hard to determine how the Unreal Engine would or could be used to try to affect such changes as described in the 
above cited correspondence. "
1280,36," Epic Games cites authority that it is not in the public interest to enforce illegal contracts. Of course, these cases presuppose a 
showing on the illegality of the contract, which Epic Games has not yet done, and are therefore inapposite. "

1285,7," The court limits its review for purposes of 28 U.S.C. § 1915A to federal law claims. That is because the core purpose of an 
initial review order is to make a speedy initial screening determination of whether the lawsuit may proceed at all in federal court 
and should be served upon any of the named defendants. If there are no facially plausible federal law claims against any of the 
named defendants, then the court would decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over any state law claims under 28 U.S.C. 
§ 1367. On the other hand, if there are any viable federal law claims that remain, then the validity of any accompanying state law 
claims may be appropriately addressed in the usual course by way of a motion to dismiss or motion for summary judgment. 
More generally, the court's determination for purposes of an initial review order under 28 U.S.C. § 1915A that any claim may "
1286,," proceed against a defendant is without prejudice to the right of any defendant to seek dismissal of any claims by way of a motion

specifically. The arraignment report states further that Bastone had contacted the Bethel Police Department about fearing for her 
life and provided a written statement about past violence against her by Sentementes; that Bastone had obtained a restraining

1291,14," In this severing order, the court does not address the merits of these claims. "
1294,15," The court notes that Sentementes is asserting kidnapping and threatening as civil claims. Kidnapping and threatening are 
criminal offenses under the Connecticut General Statutes. The Connecticut Supreme Court has held that, unless private 
enforcement is expressly stated in a statute, there is a presumption in Connecticut that private enforcement does not exist. See 
Provencher v. Town of Enfield, 284 Conn. 772, 777, 936 A.2d 625 (2007). The burden is on the plaintiff to overcome that 
presumption and show that the statute creates an implied right of action. Id. at 777-78. Sentementes also alleges that Public Act 
107 ""specifically states that [he] cannot be denied his right to eat when his assets fall under a restraining order."" If Sentementes 
reasserts this claim, he should cite to the specific statutory or legal provision supporting it. "
1297,1," On August 19, 2020, Actavis informed the Court that it had reached a settlement agreement with the DPPs. [FWK 472]. That 
settlement does not resolve the Plaintiffs' claims against Shire or the IPPs' claims against Actavis."
1297,2," For purposes of this memorandum and order, the Court refers to docket entries in FWK, et al. v. Shire, et al., 16-cv-12653 as 
""FWK [ECF No.]"" and docket entries in Picone, et al. v. Shire, et al., 16-cv-12396 as ""Picone [ECF No.]."" "
1304,3," ""Shire presented evidence with respect to several indicia of non-obviousness, e.g., commercial success and copying. I 
understand that the former can be a particularly important secondary consideration of non-obviousness; although I am not an 
economist, having reviewed Shire's materials pertaining to commercial success (outlined in the next paragraph), it seems that 
this evidence would have helped Shire's non-obviousness case."" [FWK 301-99 ¶ 218]."
1304,4," ""According to the trial testimony of Matthew Pauls, Vice President of Global Commercial Operations for Shire Regenerative 
Medicine, Shire's gross sales for Intuniv had doubled between 2010 and 2012, and significantly outpaced the growth of the 
overall U.S. anti-ADHD market. By 2012, the year of the trial in the Intuniv Patent Litigation, Intuniv was on pace to earn more 
than $500 million in annual gross sales and was one of the top 200 drugs in terms of sales overall in the U.S. market. Mr. Pauls 
called Intuniv's sales 'remarkable' and testified that Intuniv was 'without question' a commercial success. Dr. Rausser, Shire's 
expert economist testified that commercial success was not 'a close call,' i.e., undeniable. Shire argued that Intuniv had become 
more popular than Strattera, a competing non-stimulant anti-ADHD drug product, despite Strattera's seven-year first-mover 
advantage. Actavis countered that Intuniv's commercial success was due to marketing efforts, rather than owing to the patented 
invention."" [FWK 301-99 ¶ 219]."
1304,5," ""In my opinion, the evidence presented at trial suggests that Actavis tried to copy the Intuniv formulation because of the latter's 
superior and innovative sustained-release profile and that at least some of the commercial success of Intuniv must be due to its 
superior and innovative sustained-release profile."" [FWK 301-99 ¶ 222]. "

interpretation of the scope of the professional services and managed care exclusions. Id. at 61:24-62:1. Defendant answered 
that a non-resident visiting the Facility who slipped and fell would encounter a loss not excluded by the professional service or 
managed care exclusions. Id. at 62:2-9. Defendant continued that the D&O Policy ""is written to protect the company . . .for 
basically claims arising out of third parties, not the people that are being cared for in the facility."" Id. at 62:10-13. This Court does 
not understand Defendant's example. The D&O Policy at hand explicitly excludes claims ""for actual or alleged bodily injury . . . of 
any person."" DE 57-1 at 21 (emphasis added). Further, nothing in the plain language of the D&O Policy indicates that it was the

1344,11," At the Hearing on the parties' Motions for Summary Judgment held on July 30, 2020, Plaintiffs argued that Argonaut's 
interpretation of the exclusion was unreasonable and rendered the D&O Policy coverage illusory in a way contrary to Maryland 
law. See DE 72 at 26:5-28:5. They contended that under Argonaut's interpretation were they to buy an insurance policy today on 
a nursing home with existing residents and admit no new patients for a year, there would be no coverage under the policy for 
that year because the residents' admission dates predate the policy's cut-off date. Id. at 26:1-9. The plain language of the D&O 
Policy gives the Court no reason to believe the parties intended to exclude coverage for any act related to residents who were 
admitted to the Facility prior to December 1, 2012. "
1345,12," Indeed, Count III takes pains to specify that ""[f]or the purposes of this count and only this count, it is not alleged that 
Defendants are an entity that established, controlled, conducted, managed or operated the Facility."" DE 57-1 at ¶ 128. "
1347,13," The parties also proffer arguments regarding the exclusion of coverage for punitive damages. See, e.g., DE 27 at 22-23; DE 
57 at 10-12. Generally, Defendant argues that because the conduct that would give rise to punitive damages occurred in Florida, 
Florida law—which prohibits the insurability of punitive damages—should apply. DE 57 at 10-12. On this basis, Defendant 
argues punitive damages are not covered by the D&O Policy. Id. at 12. Plaintiffs respond that Maryland law allows the 
insurability of punitive damages, and if there is any ambiguity about what law to apply, that ambiguity must be construed in their 
favor. DE 61 at 16. The Court need not decide which law applies because the Underlying Complaint does not seek punitive 
damages. See generally DE 57-1. Rather, it reserves the right to ""to amend this Complaint to add a demand for punitive 
damages at the appropriate time."" E.g., id. at 34. Also, even if the D&O Policy excluded punitive damages, the fact remains that 
some damages are not covered such that a duty to defend exist."

factual information to provide the ""grounds"" on which the claim rests[.]"" In re Pre-Filled Propane Tank Antitrust Litig. (""Propane 
I""), 860 F.3d 1059, 1070 (8th Cir. 2017) (en banc) (quoting Schaaf v. Residential Funding Corp., 517 F.3d 544, 549 (8th Cir. 
2008))."
1378,12," Defendants argue that the alleged reductions in supply are not ""proximate in time and value,"" a standard quoted in a see-also 
parenthetical of the Court's August Order. In re Pork, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 133165, 2019 WL 3752497, at *8 (quoting In re 
Generic Pharm Pricing Antitrust Litig., 338 F. Supp. 3d 404, 441 (E.D. Pa. 2018)). HN10[
] However, the Supreme Court noted 
more than 80 years ago that ""simultaneous action is not a requirement to demonstrate parallel conduct."" In re Broiler Chicken, 
290 F. Supp. 3d 772, 791 (N.D. Ill. 2017) (citing Interstate Circuit v. United States, 306 U.S. 208, 227, 59 S. Ct. 467, 83 L. Ed. 
610 (1939). Although the Eighth Circuit affirmed the dismissal of a Sherman Act claim for failure to plead parallel conduct where defendants' 
actions were separated by six months, the termination of the plaintiff from the pharmacy benefit networks of CVS and Express 
Scripts was also the ""only allegation that hints at parallel conduct"" in that case and the panel specifically noted that it was not 
establishing a bright-line rule. Park Irmat Drug Corp. v. Express Scripts Holding Co., 911 F.3d 505, 514-16 (8th Cir. 2018). This 
case, where Plaintiffs allege that Defendants took several specific actions under very similar circumstances, is distinguishable."

] Claims for injunctive relief under § 16 of the Clayton Act are not subject to the four-year time bar under § 4b. See 15 U.S.C. § 15b (stating that the statute of limitations applies only to ""any cause of action under section 15, 15a, or 15c of this title"" 
and not to 15 U.S.C. § 26); see also Midwestern Machinery Co., Inc. v. Northwest Airlines, Inc., 392 F.3d 265, 276-77 (8th Cir. 
2004) (analyzing a Clayton Act damages claim under the four-year time bar and a Clayton Act injunctive-relief claim under the 
equitable doctrine of laches). Defendants do not argue that laches should bar Plaintiffs' Clayton Act claims for injunctive relief. Therefore, Plaintiffs' claims for 
injunctive relief under 15 U.S.C. § 26 survives, regardless of whether their damage claims under 15 U.S.C. § 15 are time barred "
1380,14," Indeed, the Court has previously noted that plaintiffs might not be required to plead due diligence at all, given that it is an 
affirmative defense. TCF Nat. Bank v. Mkt. Intelligence, Inc., Civ. No. 11-2717 JRT/AJB, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1024, 2013 WL

action is substantive)."
1383,17," There is no doubt that Rule 23 would preempt the IAA under the reasoning of Justice Scalia's plurality opinion. Therefore, if 
the plurality opinion were the operative opinion under the Marks rule, the Court would also deny the Motion to Dismiss. "
1384,18," Fitch is also instructive. The state supreme court concluded that Mississippi had failed to allege wholly intrastate conduct by 
Japanese auto manufactures under the MAA—even though the complaint mentioned that ""both Nissan and Toyota had [original-
equipment manufacturers (""OEMs"")] in Mississippi""—because it ""neither allege[d] [that] the defendant sold [Automotive Wire 
Harness Systems (""AWHS"")] in Mississippi nor that the OEMs, suppliers, or distributors that directly purchased AWHS from the 
defendants were in Mississippi."" State ex rel. Fitch, 294 So. 3d at 1189-90. "
1385,19," Because the Court declines to find that the consumer-protection claims are subject to Rule 9(b), it is unnecessary to determine 
whether the allegations are pleaded with sufficient particularity to survive a Motion to Dismiss and the Court will decline to do so. "
1386,20," In 2017, the statute was amended to require proof of reliance. See Ark. Code §§ 4-88-113(f)(1)(A), (f)(2). "
1388,21," Defendants rely on In re Aftermarket Filters Antitrust Litigation, which concluded that complaints under the RIDTPA must 
allege ""that defendants' conduct reasonably intended to confuse and mislead the general public into purchasing defendants' 
product when the actual intent was to buy someone else's product."" 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 104114, 2009 WL 3754041, at *11 
(N.D. Ill. Nov. 5, 2009). This case is unhelpful for two reasons. First, it relies on a line of decisions based on Merlino v. Schmetz, 
66 R.I. 425, 20 A.2d 266, 267 (R.I. 1941), which predates Ames by decades and also predates the Federal Trade Commission 
definition of ""unfair."" Second, Aftermarket misquotes the cases on which it relies, which required that the unfair conduct must 
""tend"" to confuse, not ""intend"" to confuse. See ERI Max Entm't, Inc. v. Streisand, 690 A.2d 1351, 1353 (R.I. 1997). ""Tend"" in this 
context refers to behavior that is likely to confuse consumers; intent is irrelevant. See Merlino, 20 A.2d at 267 (holding that a 
defendant's barber-shop window sign did not constitute unfair competition because people were unlikely to be deceived into 
mistaking it for plaintiff's sign). Plaintiffs' allegations describe behavior that likely misled consumers into buying pork at artificially 
high prices. "
1392,22, The IPPs do not bring a claim under section 11.
1392,23," Indirect Plaintiffs' reliance on LaChance v. U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Co., 156 N.H. 88, 931 A.2d 571 (N.H. 2007) is misplaced. 
In LaChance, he New Hampshire Supreme Court was answering an Illinois Brick question: did the court's rule that indirect 
purchasers may not bring claims under the Granite State antitrust statute, announced in Minuteman, LLC v. Microsoft Corp., 147 "
1393,," N.H. 634, 795 A.2d 833 (N.H. 2002), apply to claims under the NHCPA as well. The court concluded that it did not. LaChance, 
931 A.2d at 575-81. However, the Illinois Brick/Minuteman issue has no bearing on the territoriality question. "
1399,24," Indeed, when one looks to the citation used by the court in Sivertson in support of the it-is-sufficient rule, A&A Metal Buildings 
v. I-S, Inc., 274 N.W.2d 183, 189 (N.D. 1978), one sees it is merely a recitation of the five elements of a claim for unjust 
enrichment."
1399,25," Defendants' reliance on Johnson v. Ross, 419 Fed. App'x 357 (4th Cir. 2011), is misplaced. The Fourth Circuit concluded that 
the West Virginia Court of Appeals had not yet decided the direct-benefit question and expressly ""decline[d] [the] invitation to 
settle this state-law question . . . because doing so [was] unnecessary to reach [their] disposition."" Johnson, 419 Fed. App'x at 
362. "
1402,26," In its Amended Complaint, the Commonwealth alleges that it ""directly and indirectly purchased pork from Defendants[.]"" (P.R. 
Compl. ¶ 184C.) Defendants argue that this ""conclusory sentence is not enough to establish the Commonwealth"" as a direct 
purchaser. (Defs.' Mot. to Dismiss Memo. at 3 n.1, Jan. 28, 2020, 19-2723 Docket No. 107.) However, the allegation is similar to 
that used in the DPP Complaint itself. (See DPP Compl. ¶¶14-19.) The Amended Complaint also states that the Commonwealth brought this action ""on behalf of itself [that is, an allegedly direct 
and indirect purchaser] and as parens patriae [**84]  on behalf of the population of Puerto Rico."" (P.R. Compl. at 1.) HN95[
] 
States, as well as the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, are explicitly given the authority to bring a parens patriae claims for 
violations of the Sherman Act. See 15 U.S.C. §§ 15c (authorizing state attorneys general to bring parens patriae claims); 15g(2) 
(defining state to include the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico). Such claims must be on behalf of direct-purchaser residents. 
See Kansas v. UtiliCorp United, Inc., 497 U.S. 199, 218-19, 110 S. Ct. 2807, 111 L. Ed. 2d 169 (1990). However, the 
Commonwealth appears not to have pleaded—even with a simple ""conclusory sentence"" like the one in which it asserts its own 
status as a direct purchaser—that any of its residents are, in fact, direct purchasers. Therefore, the Court will consider Puerto Rico's claims on its own behalf as both direct and indirect claims but will consider its 
parens patriae claims as only being indirect. "

1413,3, Jennie-O is a Hormel turkey brand. (Dkt. 1 ¶ 9.) 
1414,4," The Complaint says that ""industry supply decreased significantly from 2009 to 2015, but Figure 1 shows that the market 
experienced small rates of changes year-over-year in terms of heads slaughtered. (Id. ¶ 108.)"
1414,5, 16 CV 8637 (N.D. Ill.). 
1415,6," Collectively, the nine Turkey Defendants control eighty percent of the turkey production and processing market. (Id. ¶ 102.)"
1415,7," Co-conspirators are Circle S-Ranch, Prestage Farms, and West Liberty Foods. (Id. ¶¶ 64-66.) "
1416,8," Even if the Court found that this was a rimless conspiracy, the authority Defendants cite for the proposition that rimless 
conspiracies are not cognizable is not so clear. See Howard Hess Dental Labs, Inc. v. Dentsply Int'l, Inc., 602 F.3d 237, 256 (3d "
1417,," Cir. 2010) (specifically declining to decide whether an allegation of a rimless conspiracy is ""legally viable or even relevant"" to the

1420,10," Citing Bank of Am., N.A. v. Knight, 725 F.3d 815, 818 (7th Cir. 2013), Cooper contends that this is a case of group pleading, 
such that Cooper is not on notice of the allegations specific to it. This contention does not hold water because the deficiency of 
the allegations in Knight was that the members of the alleged conspiracy could not decipher ""who did what."" Here, the 
allegations are clear that Cooper participated in the conspiracy by sharing and receiving competitively sensitive information 
through Agri Stats and that that exchange resulted in decreased outputs and higher prices. "
1431,1," AdBlue ""is a substance that breaks emissions from diesel engines down into less harmful compounds."" Order re Second MTD 
(dkt. 432) at 2. "
1432,2, The Court dismissed IPPs' state law claims for the same reasons. See Order re Second MTD at 21. 
1433,3, DPPs also incorporate IPPs' argument that diesel passenger vehicles comprise a distinct submarket. DPP 2AC ¶ 159. 
1437,4," IPPs acknowledge that the DOJ & FTC Guidelines require applying a price increase to the ""price paid by customers for the 
products or services to which the . . . firms contribute value."" DOJ & FTC Horizontal Merger Guidelines § 4.1.2; IPP Opp. to Joint 
MTD 2AC at 26. IPPs assert that the extent to which Defendants contribute value to the vehicles they manufacture beyond those 
vehicles' diesel engines is a factual question. IPP Opp. to Joint MTD 2AC at 27. That is wrong. Assessing value contribution 
merely requires evaluating the relevant companies' positions in their industry. DOJ & FTJ Horizontal Merger Guidelines § 4.1.2. 
For example, in a merger ""between two oil pipelines,"" courts and government agencies would evaluate ""the price charged for 
transporting the oil, not . . . the price of the oil itself."" Id. Thus, for auto manufacturers, the relevant price is the price of the 
vehicles (whereas in the vehicle shipping industry, the relevant price would be the price of transporting vehicles). Although 
special circumstances might require a more nuanced approach, IPPs have not explained why such circumstances apply here. "
1438,5," IPPs' allegation that Defendants comprise a concentrated set of manufacturers within a relevant market fails because it 
depends on IPPs' flawed definition of that market. See IPP 2AC ¶¶ 182-193. "
1439,6," The former chair of the Germany Monopoly Commission Justus Haucap's statement that when steel customers do not 
individually negotiate prices, ""competition suffers,"" and ""usually end users, such as car buyers, suffer because they pay too high 
a price"" is not evidence of an agreement to pass-through increased steel costs to customers. See DPP Exhibits 1, 2 (dkt. 448). 
At most, Justus Haucap's statements indicate that a lack of individual negotiation among Defendants with steel manufacturers 
could have led to (but did not necessarily lead to) increased steel prices. "

1476,5," It bears noting that Defendants have only cited a few cases where state consumer protection claims were dismissed under the 
Rule 9(b) pleading requirements. These cases do not apply here in any event as the claims in the cited cases were relatively 
straightforward fraud claims, not allegations of unfair business practices as found here. "
1477,6," The one case Defendants cite, Staley v. Gilead Scis., Inc., 446 F. Supp. 3d 578, 2020 WL 1032320, at *35 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 3, 
2020), did not even present a SCUTPA claim."
1477,7," Defendants allege and Plaintiff concedes that it cannot recover damages under Minnesota's consumer protection statute. 
However, the fact that Plaintiff seeks injunctive relief is not a ground for dismissal. See Force v. ITT Hartford Life & Annuity Ins. 
Co., 4 F. Supp. 2d 843, 857 (D. Minn. 1998). Likewise, the fact that Plaintiff can only recover restitution under California's statute 
is not grounds for dismissal. See In re Abbott Labs. Norvir Anti-Tr. Litig., 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 138642, 2008 WL 11394207, at 
*2 (N.D. Cal. July 8, 2008). "

and six months or less of experience. Id. ""D"" drivers are drivers with more than six months of experience. Id. "
1495,1," Plaintiff made clear that Centurion was included as a Defendant pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 19 because it is a party in interest 
in the subject of the action."
1495,2," The following facts, unless identified as in dispute or otherwise qualified herein, are taken as true for purposes of the Motion, 
because they are either: (1) asserted and evidentially supported at least to some degree by one party and not rebutted by the 
other side; (2) otherwise not in genuine dispute; (3) asserted and evidentially supported by one side to such an extent, or in such 
a manner, that they are credited by this Court even if rebutted to some extent by the other side; or (4) subject to judicial notice."
1495,3," There were many other amendments to the RFP. For ease of reference, the Court has enumerated only the amendments 
material for purposes of deciding this Motion."
1495,4," Herein, cited page numbers are the numbers stamped on the applicable pages by the Clerk's Office, which may differ from the 
page numbers placed on the document by the author/filer of the document. "
1496,5," Plaintiff alleges that this amount represented an increase from an initial amount of $118,000,000.00 when the Contract was 
announced and that no explanation for the increase has been provided."
1496,6," The Court has difficulty reconciling what appear to be two diametrically opposed accounts of who would have been responsible 
for setting the performance bond requirement—TDOC or the CPO. But it need not reconcile them, or alternatively declare them 
irreconcilable (and thus potentially problematic for Defendants), because the Motion is subject to denial in any event for the 
reasons set forth herein. For the same reason, the Court need not draw any conclusions as to how involved Landers was in the 
setting of the amount of the performance bond—even though the Court does not begrudge Plaintiff its apparent suspicions on 
this issue. "
1497,7," To promote clarity of analysis, the Court must pause to explain its terminology, which may differ substantially from the 
terminology used by cited cases or the parties herein. As the term is used herein by the undersigned, laches is ""applicable"" 
when a court rules that laches bars the particular equitable relief at issue, whereas laches is only ""potentially applicable"" when 
the court is not prohibited ab initio from applying laches by threshold considerations—such as laches being entirely supplanted 
by a particular statute of limitation or the fact that the kind of requested relief at issue is not the kind of relief subject to the 
equitable concept of laches—but may yet determine not to apply laches. Chirco v. Crosswinds Communities, Inc., 474 F.3d 227 
(6th Cir. 2007), cited below, actually used the phrase ""is even applicable,"" id. at 231, without including ""potentially""; in context, 
however, the phrase clearly was meant to mean potentially applicable as that term is used herein. Notably, even where laches is 
""potentially applicable"" as the Court uses that term, a district court cannot apply—lacks the discretion to apply—laches unless 
the court finds that its two required elements exist. Where the terminology of Plaintiff or Defendants, or of a cited case, for these 
concepts differs from the Court's terminology, the Court will convert such terminology into the Court's terminology. "
1498,8," Laches generally is potentially applicable to requested equitable relief (including but not limited to injunctions) sought in civil 
actions. See Obiukwu v. United States, 14 F. App'x 368, 369 (6th Cir. 2001); Memphis A. Phillip Randolph Inst. v. Hargett, No. 
3:20-CV-00374, 473 F. Supp. 3d 789, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 133721, 2020 WL 4279623, at *5 n.8 (M.D. Tenn. July 21, 2020). 
By contrast, laches generally is not potentially applicable to claims for money damages, although there are exceptions. As 
explained by another district court in this circuit, ""[l]aches is an equitable doctrine and, as a general rule, remains inapplicable to 
legal claims for damages."" United States v. Robbins, 819 F. Supp. 672, 674 (E.D. Mich. 1993) (citations omitted). By contrast, 
""[c]laims in equity, of course, invite equitable defenses, including laches."" Id. at n.2. "
1499,9," The Court has structured its discussion so as to address each of Plaintiff's arguments in turn not because it places any (non-
existent) burden on Plaintiff to show that laches should not be applied, but rather because it believes that: (1) analytical clarity is 
maximized by examining the issues primarily with reference to Plaintiff's specific arguments rather than Defendants'; and (2) 
Defendants' arguments generally need not be discussed separately, because the gist of them will be adequately reflected in the 
Court's response to Plaintiff's arguments and the Court's own conclusions. "
1500,10," Plaintiff additionally makes the argument that ""[r]efusing to allow Corizon to pursue the only relief that it can seek in the context 
of sovereign immunity and allowing Defendants to move forward with the Contract is tantamount to dismissal."" (Doc. No. 28 at 
9). The refusal by the Court to grant a TRO perhaps is tantamount to dismissal. But that does not mean that any such de facto 
dismissal would be either unwarranted or the Court's fault. Plaintiff cannot choose to not file a protest under a relevant 
Tennessee statute, not bring a suit for months, and then file for an injunction less than two weeks before a contract is supposed 
to go into effect and then blame the Court for taking away its ""only relief."" Plaintiff has done that to itself."
1500,11," As noted below, the Court simply cannot accept this proposal. On the other hand, it perhaps could accept the proposition—
apparently widely recognized, if the Fifth Circuit has it right—that if equitable relief is sought on an antitrust claim filed after the 
expiration of the limitations period governing the claim, then there is a rebuttal presumption of prejudice to the defendant for 
purposes of the laches analysis. Kaiser Aluminum & Chem. Sales, Inc. v. Avondale Shipyards, Inc., 677 F.2d 1045, 1057 (5th 
Cir. 1982) (collecting cases). But the validity of that proposition is not at issue here. "
1501,12," It is actually evident that Plaintiff was already aware of much of the substance of this lawsuit as early as June 12, 2020. A 
letter to Maggie Wilson raised concerns about both the bond requirement and Lander's employment. (Doc. 32-1 at 5). However, 
from the language of this letter, it appears Plaintiff, though aware of many of the facts and circumstances in the Complaint, did 
not yet have as much information as it would have when submitting its draft protest six weeks later. Plaintiff does state that in the August 26, 2020, disclosures it learned some additional information it did not have by July 24: the 
deadlines had been moved for Defendant Centurion and there had been an alleged $5,000,000.00 increase in the Contract 
price. (Doc. No. 28 at 18). However, these discoveries make up just a small (and inessential) part of Plaintiff's claims in its 
Complaint, and Plaintiff knew the bulk of the factual underpinnings of its Complaint much earlier than August. Plaintiff does not point to anything in the September 1, 2020, production of documents that it needed to bring the present lawsuit, 
though it seems to imply that the Court should accept this September production as evidence that it did not delay. (Id. at 18). 
Additionally, Plaintiff seems to imply that its later document analysis (of either the August or September documents, as the 
supplemental brief is unclear) brought to light Landers' alleged behavior/conflict of interest. But the Court believes Plaintiff to 
have cited and quoted from these documents in its draft protest provided to Defendants on July 24, as previously discussed. (Id. 
at 19). And Plaintiff was complaining about Landers' alleged behavior/conflict as early as June 12. Plaintiff also argues that it did not suffer any antitrust harm until the Contract was signed, but the Court is unpersuaded that this 
is the case. (Doc. No. 28 at 21). Without passing judgment on the merits of Plaintiff's antitrust claim (including the idea that what 
allegedly occurred in this case constitutes ""bid rigging"" for purposes of a per se antitrust violation), the Court notes that Plaintiff 
has proceeded under a theory of bid-rigging. (Doc. No. 3 at 18). It would follow that the injury would be incurred when the bid is 
rigged and the Contract is awarded to another party resulting in a harm to Plaintiff, not on the formality of the Contract being 
signed. See e.g., United States v. Dynalectric Co., 861 F.2d 722 (6th Cir. 1988); United States v. W.F. Brinkley & Son Constr. 
Co., 783 F.2d 1157, 1160 (4th Cir. 1986). Section 1 of the Sherman Act instructs that ""[e]very contract, combination in the form 
of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is 
declared to be illegal."" 15 U.S.C. § 1. The Supreme Court has repeatedly interpreted Section 1 to bar only ""unreasonable 
restraints of trade."" Nat'l Collegiate Athletic Ass'n v. Bd. of Regents of Univ. of Oklahoma, 468 U.S. 85, 98, 104 S. Ct. 2948, 82 
L. Ed. 2d 70 (1984). Therefore, the Sherman Act does not even require a ""contract"" as Plaintiff seems to imply, a combination or 
conspiracy (all/any of which Plaintiff seems to allege, (Doc. No. 1 at 29)) would suffice for antitrust liability if it constitutes an 
""unreasonable restraint of trade."" The Court therefore does not see why Plaintiff would need to have waited until receiving a 
copy of the Contract to protect its rights by filing with this Court."
1501,13," Tenn. Code Ann. § 12-3-514 provides a RFP respondent an avenue to protest, to the chief procurement officer, a procurement 
within seven days after the respondent becomes aware (or should have become aware) of the facts giving rise to the protest. 
The contract award is stayed while the protest is considered. "
1502,14," One thing notably missing from the draft proposal is an analysis of antitrust law. Instead, the draft focuses entirely on state 
law arguments. However, the letter explaining the decision not to file the draft protest does indicate that Plaintiff was already 
aware of this as a potential argument, noting that Plaintiff believed the bond requirement ""hampers competition."" (Doc. No. 17-4 
at 1). Plaintiff argues that one of the reasons it has not delayed is that ""antitrust law is complex requiring substantial research 
and analysis."" (Doc. No. 28 at 20). Though the Court does not doubt this is true, there is only so much time such research 
should take; this kind of work is important and can be specialized, but no Herculean effort would have been required to take 
what had already been done and build on it to file a complaint and motion for TRO. Plaintiff and its counsel had most of the 
factual underpinnings of the potential antitrust argument in July, and the Court is unpersuaded that application of laches is 
precluded because Plaintiff had too much additional work to do and/or later thought of a complex legal issue it wished to raise 
and needed time to research it."
1502,15," The Court also notes that from the expert's list of documents consulted, (Doc. 5-3), it appears that Plaintiff possessed most of 
the documents consulted by the expert by the filing of the draft protest (with the apparent exception of the signed Contract and 
Defendant Centurion's bond confirmations). "
1503,16," The statute specifies that a bond will be paid to the state if certain requirements are not met, the claim is brought in bad faith, 
the protest does not state on its face a valid basis, or ""for any other reason approved by the protest committee."" Tenn. Code 
Ann. § 12-3-514(c), (d). "
1504,17," Plaintiff has filed a series of emails between representatives of Plaintiff and the State. These extend from July into September 
2020. (Doc. No. 32-3). However, Plaintiff's Complaint and arguments seem wholly based on documents and factual 
circumstances of which Plaintiff was aware in July. The Court is not convinced that there was sufficient reason for Plaintiff to wait 
and file the present lawsuit less than two weeks before Defendant Centurion's contract was set to go into effect. Though perhaps 
Plaintiff may have been hoping that the document production in September would contain additional information on which to 
base a complaint, Plaintiff had already passed up an opportunity to appeal pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. § 12-3-514 when it 
possessed similar (if not exactly the same) documents presented to this Court in connection with the Verified Complaint. 
Additionally, Plaintiff moved in this case for expedited discovery. If Plaintiff felt the State was dragging its feet, Plaintiff could 
have filed the present action much earlier and moved for expedited discovery (as it has now done in the instant action). Plaintiff 
also claims that it did not know that Defendants would be terminating Plaintiff's 2016 Contract early (on November 1), instead of 
December 31, 2020, which created the present time crunch for resolving its request for a TRO. (Doc. No. 28 at 3; Doc. No. 33-
2). However, Plaintiff has already had an opportunity to protest under the Tennessee statute and many months to file with this 
Court. The Court is not persuaded by Plaintiff's argument, which seems to imply that Plaintiff's original plan prior to the contract 
termination date being moved up was to file for a TRO and/or preliminary injunction nearer to the originally December 31 
contract termination, which obviously would have presented similar laches issues. And in any event, Plaintiff learned on 
September 10 that the termination date had been moved up to October 31, (Doc. No. 33 at 1-2), thus leaving Plaintiff 51 days 
before the termination date. And yet Plaintiff waited until just 12 days remained before filing suit. "
1505,18," In reaching this conclusion, the Court credits the declaration of Samantha Phillips, (Doc. No. 18-2), whose description of the 
purported necessary steps of the transition process strikes the Court as unsurprising and unexceptional and, thus, credible."
1505,19," In her declaration, Samantha Phillips disputes this, in effect opining (based on her experience with TDOC and other 
transitions) that Plaintiff could not transition back into readiness to provide the services by November 1. The Court need not 
decide, at least at this juncture, where the truth lies here. "
1506,20," Plaintiff has sued State Defendants in their official capacities. As suggested above, in its Complaint Plaintiff has requested 
solely injunctive relief, and not damages. Plaintiff argues that its claims fall within the Ex parte Young exception because Plaintiff 
seeks ""only prospective, injunctive relief."" (Doc. No. 3 at 12). The Court notes that Defendant Centurion has raised the issue that 
this suit should be dismissed because of sovereign immunity, arguing that Plaintiff does not seek prospective relief under the 
exception to the Ex parte Young doctrine. (Doc. No. 18 at 9). This may understandably raise in observers' minds the question of 
whether the Court should even be deciding the limited applicability of laches at this time, prior to resolving the issue of whether it 
has subject-matter jurisdiction. The short answer is that the Court may do so because when faced with multiple assertions that it 
should not [*36]  take any merits-based action on a case, the Court may choose among them and need not address an assertion 
of lack of subject-matter jurisdiction before the other assertion(s). See Sinochem Int'l Co. v. Malaysia Int'l Shipping Corp., 549 
U.S. 422, 431, 127 S. Ct. 1184, 167 L.Ed.2d 15 (2007) (""[A] federal court has leeway to choose among threshold grounds for 
denying audience to a case on the merits [including alleged lack of subject-matter jurisdiction]."" (citations and internal quotation 
marks omitted)). That is, in part, because there is no mandatory sequencing of jurisdictional issues, and indeed a waivable 
jurisdiction challenge like personal jurisdiction can be decided before a non-waivable one like subject-matter jurisdiction. Id. This 
means, among other things, that the Court can decide the applicability of laches before deciding whether it has subject-matter 
jurisdiction. See Singh v. Joshi, 152 F. Supp. 3d 112 (E.D.N.Y. 2016) (""Before turning to the merits of plaintiffs' preliminary 
injunction request, the Court must address three threshold matters [i.e., requested transfer of venue, alleged lack of standing, 
and alleged applicability of laches]. Since each is distinct from the merits, the Court may address them in any order."" (citing 
Sinochem Int'l Co., 549 U.S. at 431, 127 S. Ct. 1184)). The Court therefore makes no determination on if Ex parte Young would 
allow Plaintiff to bring its claim. "
1520,1," The Court recognizes that NIC maintains that the law of the case doctrine applies because the Court has addressed the exact 
same legal question in its earlier Rule 11 Order. Reply at 10, Dkt. No. 1055. While the Court acknowledges NIC's argument, it 
nonetheless examines the application of Noerr-Pennington given the possibility of new arguments made. "
1525,1," In this order, ""Defendants"" refers only to the moving parties since the other defendants are no longer parties to this action."
1525,2," Lapping filed objections to some of Defendants' evidentiary submissions. [Docket 40-3, Objections to and Motion to Strike 
Facts in Defendants' Affidavits (""Mot. to Strike."").] In reaching its decision, the court does not rely on any of the evidence 
objected to by Lapping. Accordingly, the motion to strike is denied as moot."
1525,3," Lapping's declaration states that Milholland asked Lapping to transfer. Lapping Decl. ¶ 9. The complaint says that he 
transferred at Cooksey's request. Compl. ¶ 10. Lapping's February 13, 2017 email complaint to WVO represents that both Muro 
and Cooksey asked him to transfer. [Docket No. 36-5, Declaration of Kaui Crivello (""Crivello Decl.""), Ex. L at Bates No. 
WVO000277.] The apparent discrepancy is not material to this motion."
1525,4," Paragraphs 21-25 in Lapping's declaration are erroneously numbered 14-18. To avoid ambiguity, the court cites the paragraph 
numbers as they should appear. "
1527,5," Lapping testified that he received the Code of Conduct either when he started at WVO's Kona location in March 2014 or when 
he started at Canterbury in January 2016. Lapping Depo., Vol. 1 at 60:3-17. "
1528,6, Maxwell voluntarily resigned prior to the conclusion of the investigation. See Crivello Decl. ¶ 19. 
1529,7," The parties do not dispute that complaining about illegal conduct is a protected activity or that WVO's proffered reason for 
terminating Lapping is legitimate and nonretaliatory."
1529,8," It is undisputed that Muro was also fired as a result of the investigation that began after Bassa complained in January 2017. 
Therefore, Lapping must present evidence that WVO tolerated similar conduct by Muro prior to that date."
1529,9," The Baker report recommended ""further investigation and review with regard to Milholland's role in the decline of [the 
Donatello]"" but did not recommend termination. Shadi Decl., Ex. 3 at Bates No. WVO000294. "
1530,10," At the hearing, Lapping confirmed that there is no other basis for his pretext argument."
1530,11," At the hearing, Lapping pointed to an email Bassa wrote to Crivello reporting that Muro lied to a customer. See Crivello Decl., 
Ex. I at WVO000256-57. Bassa told Crivello that the incident occurred in October 2016. See id. at WVO000257. However, 
Bassa's email was written on January 25, 2017. There is no indication that WVO had prior notice of the October 2016 incident or 
failed to take corrective action against Muro before Bassa's January 2017 email. "

law fraud."" Oregon Pub. Employees Ret. Fund v. Apollo Grp. Inc., 774 F.3d 598, 605 (9th Cir. 2014). "
1532,13," Because the court finds that Lapping has not offered evidence regarding the breach of any duty owed to him, it does not 
separately consider whether Lapping's negligence claim is barred by the state workers' compensation system. "
1546,1," Unimania, Inc. is a software development subsidiary of BrandTotal Ltd. The parties have identified no relevant distinction 
between those two entities for the purpose of present motion."
1546,2," The parties have consented to the jurisdiction of the undersigned magistrate judge for all purposes pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 
636(c)."
1546,3," This case concerns only the Facebook and Instagram social networks. References herein to Facebook's products or social 
networks therefore refer to those two networks, and not to any other networks or products that Facebook, Inc. offers. "
1548,4," Facebook voluntarily dismissed its state court action before bringing the present action in this Court, one day before BrandTotal 
had intended to seek a TRO in state court. Telscher Decl. ¶¶ 6-8."
1548,5," BrandTotal's Answer and Counterclaim is filed as a single docket entry. Citations herein to the ""Counterclaim"" refer to 
paragraphs in the portion of that document so captioned, which begins on page 14. "
1549,6," Although other browser extensions were also removed, BrandTotal seeks a TRO only with respect to UpVoice "
1551,7," A TRO issued ""without written or oral notice to the adverse party or its attorney"" is subject to additional limitations. See Fed. R. 
Civ. P. 65(b). As Facebook received notice of BrandTotal's motion and has participated in briefing and argument, those 
limitations do not apply here. "
1554,8," Facebook cites a press release as evidence that BrandTotal recently raised $12 million in venture capital funding, providing a 
URL for a PR Newswire website but no evidence in the record. Opp'n at 11. While courts may in some circumstances take 
judicial notice of the existence of public media reports, courts cannot accept as true the facts stated in such reports. See Von 
Saher v. Norton Simon Museum of Art at Pasadena, 592 F.3d 954, 960 (9th Cir. 2009). A press release might warrant 
different analysis if it is a statement of a party opponent, but in the absence of any evidence in the record regarding this 
purported press release, the Court cannot determine whether the information on the third-party website is authentic and 
BrandTotal actually made the statement at issue. The Court therefore declines to consider it. "
1555,9," Dor's declaration does not account for another period when, according to Facebook researcher Sanchit Karve, a version of 
UpVoice was available on the Chrome Web Store from October 12, 2020 to October 14, 2020, but that discrepancy does not 
undermine the inference that Google would allow the extension but for Facebook's objection. See Karve Decl. ¶ 14. "
1556,10," Thus far, BrandTotal also has not specifically addressed or attempted to justify its vice president Dor's purported creation of 
accounts using false names, in apparent violation of Facebook's terms of service. See Karve Decl. ¶ 34; Answer (dkt. 23) ¶ 61 
(admitting that a BrandTotal employee created the accounts at issue). "
1557,11," Despite the CCPA's general purpose of granting consumers greater control over how their personal information is used, 
BrandTotal has not cited any provision of that statute that specifically requires Facebook to provide the sort of access at issue 
here. See Mot. at 12-13 (addressing provisions of the statute defining ""personal information,"" providing that companies may 
compensate users for their personal information, and providing that any contract purporting to waive a right under the statute is 
unenforceable). The fact that the statute allows companies to provide financial compensation to consumers for collection of their 
personal information, Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.125(b)(1), does not by its terms require other companies that have collected users' 
information to make it available to the company offering compensation. "
1559,12," At the hearing, BrandTotal's attorney did not dispute that UpVoice could capture information from non-consenting users of 
shared computers, but asserted that BrandTotal is ""not aware of this shared-computer thing being much of an issue."" See 
Hearing Tr. at 4:17-5:24; see also id. at 23:14-26:13. "
1560,13," Facebook also argues that any potential interference with BrandTotal's contracts had a legitimate business purpose because 
""Facebook was entirely justified in incidentally interfering with a contract that threatened 'a prior contract of [its] own.'"" Opp'n at 
14 (quoting Richardson v. La Rancherita, 98 Cal. App. 3d 73, 81, 159 Cal. Rptr. 285 (1979)) (alteration in original). As discussed 
below in the context of BrandTotal's claim for declaratory judgment, the UpVoice extension very likely breached Facebook's 
terms of use. Facebook's interest in enforcing its own terms reinforces the conclusion that BrandTotal has not shown a likelihood 
of success. Richardson recognized, however, that even where a defendant seeks to enforce its own contract, the ""determinative 
question"" is the defendant's good faith. 98 Cal. App. 3d at 81. BrandTotal has also raised real issues of the extent to which 
Facebook can enforce its terms of use in a manner that stifles competition. See Mot. at 11-17. Facebook's terms of use do not 
negate the serious issues BrandTotal has shown on its claim for intentional interference with contract. "
1561,14," Some of the exhibits to Michael Duffey's declaration compress what should be many pages of text to a single column on a 
single letter-sized page. Those exhibits would be unusable in hard copy form, and the resolution of Exhibit 2 is too low to be 
legible even in its digital form. Facebook's counsel is admonished to provide any future exhibits in a functional format. "
1562,15," As perhaps a countervailing consideration to any harm it might suffer, Facebook could stand to benefit if BrandTotal's products 
incentive users to frequently interact with Facebook's networks, or if they enhance the value of advertising that third parties pay 
Facebook to host on those networks."
1562,16," Public interest—including, here, the interests of individual Facebook and BrandTotal users, who are not parties to the case—is 
also highly significant to the Court's analysis, but better addressed below in the separate element of the TRO test that looks to 
that issue. "
1563,17," Another decision from this district, on a motion for default judgment, recently granted Facebook a permanent injunction 
forbidding access by defendants accused of scraping user data from Facebook using browser extensions, citing Stackla's 
analysis of Facebook's interest in securing its platform. Facebook, Inc. v. Sluchevsky, No. 19-cv-01277-JSC, 2020 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 181249, 2020 WL 5823277, at *9 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 28, 2020), report and recommendation adopted, No. 19-cv-01277-YGR, 
2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 181241, 2020 WL 5816578 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 30, 2020)."
1563,18," UpVoice's apparent ability to collect data from other users of shared computers who have not themselves consented to 
sharing data with BrandTotal raises even greater concerns about deception. BrandTotal argued at the hearing that such 
collection is ""innocuous"" because it includes only ""deidentified demographic information,"" Hearing Tr. at 24:22-25:8, but the fact 
remains that Facebook users have at least some interest in preventing the surreptitious collection of personal information that, 
using Facebook's privacy settings, they may have chosen to share only with select other users of the Facebook Network. 
BrandTotal's decoupling of that demographic information from a user's name does not entirely negate the user's privacy interest. "
1564,19," Because the Court denies BrandTotal's motion based on public interest, the Court does not reach Facebook's argument that 
the order BrandTotal seeks—compelling Facebook to ""take other reasonable actions in communication with Google"" to ensure 
reinstatement of the UpVoice browser extension—would not meet the standards of specificity and enforceability required for an 
injunction under Rule 65(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. See Opp'n at 10. "

percentage figure (i.e., that a station's revenue indicates that it is pacing plus or minus 10%, 20%, 30%, or so on). Pacing 
indicates how each station is performing compared to the rest of the market and provides insight into each station's remaining 
broadcast television spot advertising inventory for a current or future period. The exchange of pacing information reveals the 
Broadcaster Defendants' remaining supply, with supply being a, if not the, key factor informing negotiations over price."" (Dkt. 292

878 (7th Cir. 2015) (""Text Messaging II""). But this case is in a different posture than In re Text Messaging, as discovery had 
already taken place in that case. In the current posture of this case, the Court does not look to evidence to which Plaintiffs do not 
have access and instead only concerns itself with the plausibility of the allegations in the pleadings. "
1591,7," The Court could perform a ""quick look"" analysis, by which the Court asks whether ""an observer with even a rudimentary

However, as the parties have fully briefed the rule of reason analysis, the Court will apply it. Some Courts within this Circuit have 
also held that the Court need not resolve which antitrust analysis applies at the motion to dismiss stage. Rockford v. Mallinckrodt 
ARD, Inc., 360 F. Supp. 3d 730, 753-54 (N.D. Ill. 2019) (finding that the court did not need to determine which mode of antitrust

1595,8," Even if the Court were to reach the merits of the successor liability claim against Gray TV, the Court would still dismiss the 
claim because Raycom still exists as an entity, so it cannot appropriately be deemed Gray TV's successor."
1595,9," Gray TV initially argued that Plaintiffs cannot find Gray TV liable under a veil-piercing claim. (Dkt. 331). Plaintiffs did not 
respond to Gray TV's arguments, instead arguing they could find Gray TV liable under federal successor liability. (Dkt. 349). 
Plaintiffs concede that the Complaint ""did not invoke a veil piercing theory."" (Dkt. 349 at 6). "
1600,1," Defendant David Hicks also filed a motion to dismiss, but Plaintiff entered a stipulation agreeing to his dismissal, thereby 
mooting his motion. (See ECF Nos. 17 and 23.) "
1602,2, Neither McAdams nor Heizer are parties to this suit.
1602,3," As previously set forth in the first footnote, Hicks has been dismissed from this action. "
1604,4," As discussed in greater detail below, these disparities also inform the Court's conclusion that Plaintiffs' complaint fails to 
adequately allege a RICO enterprise for purposes of any of Plaintiffs' claims. "
1605,5," In short, the Court agrees with Defendants that ""Plaintiffs are attempting to manufacture a RICO complaint against the McNair 
Firm by recounting every instance of alleged misconduct by the firms' attorneys in the last decade."" (ECF No. 16-1 at 18.)"
1605,6," In their response to Defendants' motion to dismiss, Plaintiffs assert that their complaint adequately alleges an association-in-
fact enterprise. (ECF No. 22 at 21.) Specifically, Plaintiffs state that they ""alleged that the individual defendants formed the illegal 
enterprise for the (1) single purpose of defrauding the clients of the firm, by (2) the supervising attorney and her associate in the 
same firm who copy each other on the majority of incriminating emails, that lasted (3) for more than 4 years."" (Id.) First, to the 
extent Plaintiffs now allege that the single purpose of the enterprise was to defraud clients of the firm, the Court notes that 
Plaintiffs do not allege that West Town was ever a client of the firm. Second, to the extent Plaintiffs attempt to re-characterize the 
complaint's definition of their alleged enterprise, Plaintiffs have not filed a motion to amend their complaint. "
1606,7," The Court need not reach Defendants' remaining allegations of error, including their statute-of-limitations arguments. With 
regard to one issue, however, the Court simply notes that it agrees with Defendants that Burr & Forman, LLP is subject to 
dismissal. Plaintiffs do not respond to Defendants' arguments on this point, but it appears that Burr Forman, LLP is a distinct 
corporate entity from the McNair firm and is not a South Carolina professional association."
1606,8," Plaintiffs assert in response to Defendants' motion that if the Court dismisses their federal claims, ""then Rabon & Rabon would 
agree to a remand on its state law claims, leaving only West Town Bank as the Plaintiff,"" which would provide the Court with 
diversity jurisdiction. (ECF No. 22 at 28.) This case was originally filed in federal court and was not removed from state court, 
and it is not possible for the Court to remand only one Plaintiffs claims to state court. "
1607,1," Having carefully considered the papers filed in connection with the Motion, the Court deemed the matter appropriate for 
decision without oral argument. Fed. R. Civ. P. 78; C.D. Cal. L.R. 7-15. "
1611,2," Dell also argues that MerkAmerica's UCL claim is barred because it arises solely from Dell's performance under the 
Agreement. (Mot. 17.) But this argument fails because, as explained above, the rights asserted in the claim arise under the UCL, 
not the Agreement. (See Part IV(A), supra.) "
1620,1," The Court finds that the Neo4j Sweden Software License, attached as Exhibit B to the Ratinoff Declaration, may be properly 
considered at the motion to dismiss stage because it is incorporated by reference into the FAC. See Plaintiffs' Request For 
Judicial Notice In Support of Plaintiffs' Consolidated Opposition To Defendants' Motions To Dismiss The First Amended

] Due to parallels between the Cartwright Act and Sherman Act, courts may look to cases discussing the Sherman Act when analyzing Cartwright Act violations. Marin Cty. Bd. of Realtors, Inc. v. Palsson, 16 Cal. 3d 920, 925, 130 Cal. Rptr. 1, 549 
P.2d 833 (1976); Nova Designs, Inc. v. Scuba Retailers Ass'n, 202 F.3d 1088, 1092 (9th Cir. 2000). However, these Sherman 
Act authorities are instructive, rather than conclusive. In re Cipro Cases I & II, 61 Cal. 4th at 142; Knevelbaard Dairies v. Kraft 
Foods, Inc., 232 F.3d 979, 985 (9th Cir. 2000). "
1636,4," HN11[
] While other courts have identified a ""rimless"" hub-and-spoke conspiracy, this type of conspiracy is ""a collection of 
purely vertical agreements"" and analyzed under the rule of reason. In re Musical Instruments, 798 F.3d at 1193 n.3. Thus, the 
existence of a ""rimless"" hub-and-spoke conspiracy would still call for a rule of reason analysis of the possible vertical restraints."
1636,5," Although Plaintiff disputes the fact that the contractors retained hiring authority with respect to other contractors' employees 
(ECF No. 123-1 ¶ 67), the Court finds this dispute is not genuine. Moreover, Plaintiff did not identify the portions of the record 
that support its contention. Therefore, Plaintiff failed to comply with Local Rule 260(b). HN12[
] The Court need not ""scour the 
record . . . and may rely on [Plaintiff] to identify with reasonable particularity the evidence that precludes summary judgment."" 
Simmons v. Navajo Cty., 609 F.3d 1011, 1017 (9th Cir. 2010) (quoting Keenan v. Allan, 91 F.3d 1275, 1279 (9th Cir. 1996)) 
(internal quotation marks omitted). "
1643,1," This figure includes liquidated damages for unpaid overtime under the FLSA. 29 U.S.C. § 216(b) (Liquidated damages for 
unpaid overtime is in an amount equal to the unpaid overtime.); Haro v. City of Los Angeles, 745 F.3d 1249,1259 (9th Cir. 2014). 
If an employer's conduct constitutes a ""knowing violation"" of the statute, the FLSA's standard two-year statute of limitations may 
be extended to three years. 29 U.S.C. § 255(a). It also includes Defendants' additional exposure to PAGA penalties. But note, 
because Labor Code §§ 1194.2, 203, and 226 already incorporate their own penalty provisions, an award of additional PAGA 
penalties—or an award of the maximum penalty amount provided by PAGA – is uncertain. See Cal. Lab. Code § 2699(f); see 
also Guifi Li v. A Perfect Day Franchise Inc., 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 83677, 2012 WL 2236752 at *17 (N.D. Cal. 2012) "
1663,1," The Parties agree to allocate $35,000.00 of the Gross Settlement Amount to the settlement of the PAGA claims, which the 
Parties believe in good faith is a fair and reasonable apportionment. The Settlement Administrator shall pay 75%, or $26,250.00, 
of this amount to the California Labor & Workforce Development Agency (""LWDA""), and 25%, or $8,750.00, the ""Net PAGA 
Amount,"" shall remain as part of the Net Settlement Amount, pursuant to Labor Code § 2699(i). "

1704,3," Hereinafter, ""Notice,"" a true and correct copy attached as Exhibit A to the Settlement."
1704,4," The Parties subsequently agreed to a Tolling and Dismissal Agreement (""Tolling Agreement"") on June 26, 2020, whereby 
Plaintiffs agreed to dismiss their Class and Collective action without prejudice in federal court, and TAK agreed that no statute of 
limitations on any claim would run against Plaintiffs while the agreement is in effect (except those claims that are already barred 
by any applicable statute of limitations). (Id. at ¶¶ 23-25.) "

1706,6," See California Civil Code § 1781(f); California Rule of Court 3.769; see also Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(e). The 
California Supreme Court has authorized and urged California's trial courts to use Federal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 23 and

1712,11," During the course of the litigation, 86 Technicians have submitted opt-in consent forms that have been filed as an exhibit to 
Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint. (Cottrell Decl. at ¶ 98.)"
1712,12," Lewis v. Wells Fargo & Co. (N.D. Cal. 2009) 669 F.Supp.2d 1124, 1127 ("" '[a]ll that need be shown by the plaintiff is that some 
identifiable factual or legal nexus binds together the various claims of the class members in a way that hearing the claims 
together promotes judicial efficiency and comports with the broad remedial policies underlying the FLSA.' "") (citations omitted) "
1732,1," Plaintiff's Cartwright Act claim is analyzed under the same framework as her claims brought under the Sherman Act. See 
Name.Space, Inc. v. Internet Corp. for Assigned Names & Numbers, 795 F.3d 1124, 1131 n.5 (9th Cir. 2015). "
1733,2," In declining to reach these questions, the Court does not mean to suggest that they lack merit. The complaint makes analysis 
of the antitrust claims challenging, and the Court is not willing to deny leave to amend—especially in light of the liberal 
standard—when Plaintiff's antitrust theory is difficult to comprehend. If Plaintiff elects to amend, she should take seriously the 
questions of market power and antitrust harm in asserting a facially plausible claim."
1733,3," Nor is this Court the proper forum for such a dispute. See 26 U.S.C. § 7428(a) (petitioner may bring a challenge in ""the United 
States Tax Court, the United States Court of Federal Claims, or the district court of the United States for the District of 
Columbia.""). "
1734,4," Plaintiff also asserts that jurisdiction to declare bylaws inconsistent with section 501(c)(6) can be found in the ""substantial"" 
federal interest in the question. (Opp. at 12-15.) But this assertion is nowhere to be discovered in the cited Supreme Court 
decisions about general principles of federal question jurisdiction. Congress has addressed the jurisdictional issue more 
specifically. 26 U.S.C. § 2201(a) (barring jurisdiction in claims seeking declaratory relief over tax controversies). "
1742,1, DRAM is a type of memory used to store data and programs in electronic devices. (Id. ¶ 68.) 
1743,2," The industry appears to have grown more concentrated in the last ten years. Plaintiffs allege that there were eleven DRAM 
manufacturers in 2012, but only three in March 2018. (Id. ¶¶ 245-46.) "
1744,3," Plaintiffs also allege that they purchased electronic devices from resellers, who themselves purchased the devices from one of 
the few OEMs. (CCAC ¶¶ 47, 103.) "
1745,4," Defendants also attempt to distinguish overall DRAM prices from an ""overcharge"" stemming from anticompetitive restraints. 
The Court fails to see the distinction. Prices, by their nature, incorporate overcharges, such that any price increase in DRAM is 
likely to be passed down regardless of its source."
1745,5," Defendants argue that the component cost of DRAM is lower than that previously found to satisfy this requirement. Defendants 
largely miss the point. Components that form a ""substantial component cost"" are more likely to be intertwined, a fact shown here 
because, in addition to being 5-50% of end product cost, the prices are historically correlated and DRAM makes up a critical part 
of most electronic devices. (CCAC ¶¶ 85-96.) HN3[
] For purposes of antitrust standing, Plaintiffs' claim need only be plausible, 
not fail-proof. See Los Gatos, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 106292, 2015 WL 4755335, at *16 "
1746,6," HN8[
] That conscious parallelism is permitted does not mean that it causes no harm. As the Ninth Circuit has recognized, 
""interdependent pricing may often produce economic consequences that are comparable to those of classic cartels,"" such as 
high prices for consumers. In re Coordinated Pretrial Proceedings in Petrol. Prods. Antitrust Litig. (""Petroleum Products""), 906 
F.2d 432, 444 (9th Cir. 1990); accord Clamp-All Corp. v. Cast Iron Soil Pipe Inst., 851 F.2d 478 (1st Cir. 1988). However, this 
problem stems from the nature of oligopoly, not conspiracy as such, which courts cannot remedy short of instituting price 
controls to require competitive market prices. See Areeda & Hovenkamp § 1432d5. Thus, conscious parallelism is permitted not 
because there is no harm, and not because there is no agreement, but because there is no remedy. So long as oligopolies are 
legal, courts can only control express or preexisting conduct. "
1747,7," The parties dispute whether Plaintiffs' allegations must exclude the possibility of independent conduct to survive. HN11[
] 
Generally, antitrust claims are subject to the ordinary pleading requirements, which require plaintiff to only allege enough facts to 
give rise to the ""reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged."" See Nayab v. Cap. One Bank 
(USA), N.A., 942 F.3d 480, 496 (9th Cir. 2019). However, in Twombly, the Court found that allegations of parallel conduct and 
other facts consistent with independent action are ""much like a naked assertion of conspiracy"" and insufficient to draw a 
reasonable inference of conspiracy. 550 U.S. at 556-57. Thus, while Plaintiffs are correct that courts must not compare 
inferences at the pleading stage, they must still plead enough facts inconsistent with unilateral conduct to make a conspiracy 
plausible. See id. at 557 (requiring ""allegations plausibly suggesting (not merely consistent with) agreement""); Nayab, 942 F.3d 
at 497 (interpreting Twombly to require ""facts tending to exclude the possibility [defendants] acted independently""). Plaintiffs' cited cases, which clarify that the standard for dismissal is lower than the one for summary judgment, are not to the 
contrary. See Evergreen, 720 F.3d at 48 (continuing to rely on fact allegations that are ""difficult to explain outside the context of 
a conspiracy""); In re Text Messaging Antitrust Litig., 630 F.3d 622, 628 (7th Cir. 2010) (same); SD3, LLC v. Black & Decker 
(U.S.) Inc., 801 F.3d 412, 428, 430 (4th Cir. 2015) (citing allegations of conduct that serves ""few benign purposes"" together with 
detailed description of the meeting where conspiracy began); Erie Cty., Ohio v. Morton Salt, Inc., 702 F.3d 860, 871 (6th Cir. 
2012) (citing conduct that ""has no obvious independent justification"" and would be difficult to sustain without conspiracy); Starr v. 
Sony BMG Music Ent., 592 F.3d 314, 323-25 (2d Cir. 2010) (clarifying that the motion to dismiss standard is lower than the 
summary judgment standard but continuing to rely on plus factors); cf. In re Century Aluminum Co. Sec. Litig., 729 F.3d 1104, 
1108 (9th Cir. 2013) (explaining the difference between two plausible explanations and an explanation that is not plausible 
because the facts are equally consistent with a different explanation). "
1748,8," Defendants claim that because the ""follow the leader"" strategy is permitted, Samsung's price signaling must also be allowed. 
That is not the case. HN13[
] The very nature of the follow the leader strategy is that competitors act unilaterally, with the price 
leader incurring risk by being the first to raise prices. If competitors cross the line to an a priori agreement, thereby eliminating 
that risk, the agreement may violate section 1 of the Sherman Act. "
1750,9," Persian Gulf Inc. v. BP West Coast Products LLC, 324 F. Supp. 3d 1142 (S.D. Cal. 2018) is inapposite because Plaintiffs do 
not allege any ""extreme"" action against self-interest, such as a run on the market before a power failure became announced. 
HN16[
] To the extent that Persian Gulf suggests that supply cuts in the face of rising demand are against self-interest, the 
Court respectfully disagrees because such actions are rational in an interdependent market, where market participants ""share"" 
monopoly power. Indeed, the allegations here confirm that the supply cuts ultimately benefited Defendants in the form of record 
revenues. (CCAC ¶ 209.) "
1751,10," The Court notes these alternative explanations not to compare inferences, but because they make the inference of conspiracy 
less plausible. See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 681-82, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868; Century Aluminum, 729 F.3d 
at 1108. "
