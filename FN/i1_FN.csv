24,1," It's worth noting that this part of the complaint is difficult to understand. On the one hand, the complaint alleges that dental 
practices with the iTero scanner are stuck ordering Invisalign because iTero does not, as a practical matter, facilitate orders for 
other companies' aligners. If that is true, then one wonders if the Fusion Program's purchase requirements should have any 
effect on a practice's decision to order aligners from other companies, except in the situation where a practice uses both Align's 
iTero and 3Shape's Trios (which the complaint alleges is quite unusual). Moreover, although the complaint alleges that Align is 
offering a $10,000 discount on the iTero scanner, it does not allege how significant a discount this is as a matter of percentage. 
These are just a couple examples of ambiguities in the allegations relating to Align's contractual arrangements with dental 
offices—ambiguities that, as explained in Section II.A, prevent the Court from concluding that any one contractual arrangement 
alone constitutes an antitrust violation. "
25,2," As noted earlier with respect to the Fusion Program, it's not clear why the Advantage Program's allegedly aggressive numbers-
based pricing criteria is problematic if it's true, as the plaintiffs allege elsewhere, that a dental practice with an iTero scanner is 
effectively limited to ordering Invisalign anyway. "
28,3," It's not clear that arrangements involving an aggregation of discounts across multiple related products raise exclusive dealing 
concerns. See Cascade Health, 515 F.3d at 909. But see Areeda & Hovenkamp, supra ¶ 1807b2. Nevertheless, such 
multiproduct discounts can raise antitrust concerns when they exclude equally efficient rivals that produce only one competing 
product because the rivals would have to give a much larger discount to compensate customers for the forsaken discount on 
products that they do not sell. Areeda & Hovenkamp, supra ¶ 1807b2; see Cascade Health, 515 F.3d at 909 (""[T]he primary 
anticompetitive danger posed by a multiproduct bundled discount is that such a discount can exclude a rival who is equally 
efficient at producing the competitive product simply because the rival does not sell as many products as the bundled 
discounter.""); see also LePage's, Inc. v. 3M, 324 F.3d 141 (3d Cir. 2003) (en banc), cert. denied, 542 U.S. 953, 124 S. Ct. 2932, 
159 L. Ed. 2d 835 (2004). "
41,1," Product hopping can itself be anticompetitive. See generally New York ex rel. Schneiderman v. Actavis PLC, 787 F.3d 638, 643 
& n.2, 652-59 (2d Cir. 2015); Alan Devlin, Exclusionary Strategies in the Hatch-Waxman Context, 2007 Mich. St. L. Rev. 631, 
657 - 673 (crediting Professor Hovenkamp with the ""product hop"" term)."
41,2," If Impax entered the market before resolution of the patent litigation, it would risk paying any damages for its sales in the event 
Endo later proved infringement. This is called ""at risk"" entry. See In re Lipitor Antitrust Lit., 868 F.3d 231, 241 (3d Cir. 2017). "
43,3," Reverse-payment settlements are also sometimes called ""pay for delay"" agreements. See FTC v. Watson Pharms., Inc., 677 
F.3d 1298, 1301 (11th Cir. 2012), rev'd sub nom. FTC v. Actavis, 570 U.S. 136, 133 S. Ct. 2223, 186 L. Ed. 2d 343 (2013). 
Following the Supreme Court's lead, we use the term ""reverse payment."""
43,4," The FTC required that showing of market power to show potential anticompetitive effect under Actavis. Impax does not argue 
that it lacked market power—it held a patent after all—so we need not address that issue further. "
44,5, The Commission also considered the payments to Impax for the Parkinson's research and the licenses Endo granted Impax. 
45,6," In addition to crediting these economic implications of a large reverse payment, the Supreme Court recognized the difficulty of 
trying a patent case within an antitrust case. Actavis, 570 U.S. at 157 (discussing the Eleventh Circuit's concern with ""litigat[ing] 
patent validity"" in an antitrust case, but explaining that is not needed for antitrust scrutiny). An Eleventh Circuit colleague 
apparently familiar with Cajun cuisine called this the ""turducken"" problem. Watson, 677 F.3d at 1315. "
47,7," The Fifth Circuit Pattern Jury Instructions does not include circuit-specific antitrust instructions, but refer courts and parties to 
two sources, including the ABA Antitrust Section's proposed instructions. FIFTH CIRCUIT PATTERN JURY INSTRUCTIONS (CIVIL CASES) 
§ 6 (2020)."
47,8," Even if Impax's entry date were the same in a no-payment settlement, the arrangement would be less anticompetitive than the 
actual agreement because it would not include Endo's ""payment"" of not selling a generic competitor during Impax's six-month 
exclusivity period. Thus, in a no-payment settlement, there would have been greater price competition during at least those six 
months. In any event, because the Commission's ultimate finding relied on the feasibility of a no-payment settlement with an 
earlier entry date, we only consider that agreement as a less restrictive alternative. "
48,9," The Commission's consideration of this testimony further dispels Impax's claim that the Commission did not find a settlement 
with an earlier entry date to be a viable alternative."
48,10," The case-specific nature of this aspect of the FTC's ruling undermines Impax's concern that the agency's decision would 
invalidate all reverse payment settlements. So does the FTC's enforcement record. During the first fifteen years of this century, 
the agency challenged only 6 of the 1336 brand/generic settlements entered into during that period. FTC BUREAU OF

that conclusory allegations that an affiliate joined a conspiracy are insufficient to allege that the affiliates entered into the 
conspiratorial conduct"" and that ""a parent and a subsidiary will not be held equally liable when one of them participates in

58,1, Plaintiff alleges the CCRAA violations and UCL violations on behalf of himself and two putative classes. (FAC ¶ 40.)

Equifax Info. Servs., LLC, 629 F.3d 876, 889 (9th Cir. 2010) (quotations omitted)."
60,3," In some cases, courts have expressly held that questions of reasonableness should be reserved for trial. See Gorman v. 
Wolpoff & Abramson, LLP, 584 F.3d 1147, 1157 (9th Cir. 2009) (""summary judgment is generally an inappropriate way to 
decide questions of reasonableness because the jury's unique competence in applying the 'reasonable man' standard is thought 
ordinarily to preclude summary judgment"") (quotations omitted); see also Cortez, 617 F.3d at 710 (""the reasonableness of a 
credit reporting agency's procedures is normally a question for trial unless the reasonableness or unreasonableness of the 
procedures is beyond question""). "
70,1, All references to documents filed with the Court are documents filed in the master MDL case.

71,3," ""Accounting"" is a remedy and not a cause of action. "
72,4," Torres occasionally refers to the statute number as 16660, but this appears to be a typographical error. "
77,5," In its Reply Suggestions, EquipmentShare argues that Count VII is preempted by CUTSA. The Court also rejected this 
argument previously, (Doc. 25, pp. 16-18), and the Court adheres to that decision insofar as Count VII is predicated on actions 
unrelated to Ahern Confidential Information. "
97,1," On December 23, 2020, Defendant Kranos Corporation, doing business as Schutt Sports, filed a Suggestion of Bankruptcy and 
Notice of Operation of the Automatic Stay. ECF No. 64. The Notice indicates that Defendant voluntarily filed for bankruptcy on 
December 18, 2020. While the Court acknowledges the petition filed in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of 
Delaware, the ultimate disposition of this case is not affected by Defendant's filing. "

Podiatric Surgery, Inc., 323 F.3d 366, 368 n.1 (6th Cir. 2003). "
106,1," The numbers of potential class members provided by the named plaintiffs are not completely consistent across filings, but they 
fall within a fairly narrow range. The amended complaint alleges that 137 prospective class members have been identified from 
documents produced by the defendants. Doc. 104 at ¶ 97; Doc. 81-1 (showing around 101 foreclosed North Carolina 
properties); Doc. 87-2 (showing 15 foreclosed Texas and South Carolina properties purchased by an Estates member). In one 
brief, the plaintiffs assert the existence of 120 North Carolina plaintiffs, six South Carolina plaintiffs, and nine Texas plaintiffs—
totaling only 135. Doc. 87 at 7. In another, this number shifts to 144 total plaintiffs across the three states, Doc. 100 at 4, but the 
exhibits filed to support this number, Docs. 100-1, 100-2, 100-3, show that many of the identified North Carolina properties were "
107,," owned by the same person or entity, see, e.g., Doc. 100-1 at 2 (showing Kiraboltam, LLC as owner of four foreclosed 
properties), likely lowering the 144-class-member estimate. "
108,2," See, e.g., United States v. W.F. Brinkley & Son Constr. Co., 783 F.2d 1157, 1160 (4th Cir. 1986) (holding that bid rigging is a 
per se antitrust violation); ITCO Corp. v. Michelin Tire Corp., Commercial Div., 722 F.2d 42, 48 (4th Cir. 1983) (""[P]roof of 
conduct violative of the Sherman Act is proof sufficient to establish a violation of the North Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act.""). "
109,3," No controlling precedent dictates whether a district court must conduct a Daubert analysis at the class certification stage or 
how focused or full that analysis should be. See Childress v. JPMorgan Chase & Co., No. 5:16-CV-298-BO, 2019 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 110396, 2019 WL 2865848, *2-3 (E.D.N.C. July 2, 2019); 3 Newberg on Class Actions § 7:24 (5th ed. Dec. 2020 
Update). The Supreme Court has suggested that Daubert likely applies to challenged expert testimony at this stage, Dukes, 564 
U.S. at 354, but the courts of appeals have taken different approaches to the issue. Compare In re Blood Reagents Antitrust 
Litig., 783 F.3d 183, 187 (3d Cir. 2015) (requiring a district court to rule on challenges to an expert's qualifications if the expert's 
report is ""critical to class certification""), and Am. Honda Motor Co. v. Allen, 600 F.3d 813, 815-16 (7th Cir. 2010) (same), with In 
re Zurn Pex Plumbing Prod. Liab. Litig., 644 F.3d 604, 612 (8th Cir. 2011) (approving a certification order without a full Daubert 
analysis and explaining the impracticalities of requiring a district court to consider the admissibility of evidence at the class 
certification stage), and Sali v. Corona Reg'l Med. Ctr., 909 F.3d 996, 1006 (9th Cir. 2018) (finding a district court abused its 
discretion by only reviewing admissible evidence in its class certification analysis). The Court has previously found the rationale "
110,," in In re Blood Reagents and Am. Honda Motor Co. to be persuasive. See Krakauer v. Dish Network, LLC, No. 1:14-CV-333, 
2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118858, 2015 WL 5227693, at *5 (M.D.N.C. Sept. 8, 2015)."
110,4," While Dr. McDuff's testimony might be sufficient to find a common method of proving antitrust impact at trial, that is not a sure 
thing. To provide an example, it appears that his ""but-for"" method only works if at least two Estates members expressed an 
interest in bidding on a particular property. See Doc. 145-1 at 19-22 (determining a ""but-for winning bid"" for each property as a 
partial function of ""Additional Estates bidders"" who expressed interest in a property but did not ultimately participate in the 
bidding process because of the alleged conspiracy). But what about members of the class whose properties were only ever 
subject to one expression of interest from an Estates member? And wouldn't this require individual proof to determine whether 
more than one Estates member was interested? "
117,1," Reveal Chat is the successor in interest to Reveal Chat, Inc. (f/k/a LikeBright, Inc.), pursuant to an April 2015 merger between 
Reveal Chat and Reveal Chat, Inc. Am. Compl. ¶ 18. The Court will refer to this company both pre- and post-merger as Reveal 
Chat. "
120,2," Plaintiffs do not allege that they signed any Whitelist or Data Sharing Agreements with Facebook, but they had notice of those 
agreements by September 2015. See Prior MTD Order 10; Ex. 2, Data Sharing Article, ECF 71-3. "
122,3," The Court acknowledges that the Animation Workers plaintiffs were ultimately able to plead sufficient facts to establish 
fraudulent concealment at the motion to dismiss stage after Judge Koh gave them one opportunity to amend their complaint. 
See Animation Workers II, 123 F. Supp 3d at 1193-1205. Even under Animation Workers II, the facts pled by Plaintiffs after their 
opportunity to amend are not sufficient to plausibly plead fraudulent concealment. "
127,1," The Court granted the City of Hawthorne's Motion to Dismiss without leave to amend on March 12, 2021. (Dkt. No. 55.) "
145,1," Because this matter is before the Court on a motion to dismiss, the Court must accept as true the allegations set forth in the 
complaint. See Hosp. Bldg. Co. v. Trs. Of Rex Hosp., 425 U.S. 738, 740, 96 S. Ct. 1848, 48 L. Ed. 2d 338 (1976). "
146,2, All citations to electronically filed documents refer to the pagination assigned by the CM/ECF system. 
151,3," The Court finds Plaintiffs' reliance on Melendres v. Arpaio, 784 F.3d 1254 (9th Cir. 2015), distinguishable—and thus 
unavailing—for the reasoning outlined by several recent district court cases. See Soo, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 164664, 2020 WL 
5408117, at *10-11; In re Glumetza Antitrust Litig., No. C 19-05822 WHA, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 39649, 2020 WL 1066934, at 
*10 (""The short distinction is that Melendres did not address the circumstance here, where plaintiffs raise claims under several 
jurisdictions where they were not harmed. The legal distinction, though, is that the named plaintiffs in Melendres asserted the 
same constitutional injury as the class; they just alleged different circumstances.""); Jones, 400 F. Supp. 3d at 909 (""Unlike the 
instant case, Melendres did not confront a situation where named plaintiffs brought claims under the laws of multiple states 
where they did not reside and where they were not injured: in Melendres, all plaintiffs alleged that they suffered the same 
constitutional injury, only in different factual circumstances. Here, because Plaintiffs bring claims under the laws of multiple 
states (some antitrust and some not), Plaintiffs technically invoke different legally protected interests.""). "
153,4," The concern that other customers might benefit from an injunction and have standing does not mean Plaintiffs have standing. 
See Jackson, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157898, 2020 WL 5106652, at *6; see also Spokeo, Inc., 136 S. Ct. at 1547 n.6 (quoting 
Simon, 426 U.S. at 40 n.20). "
157,5," Plaintiffs rely on a Ninth Circuit footnote to support their argument. See Doc. No. 62 at 18 (quoting Moore, 966 F.3d at 1019 
n.11). In Moore, the Ninth Circuit applied Rule 9(b) and found the plaintiffs satisfied Rule 9(b). See Moore, 966 F.3d at 1019-20. 
The court questioned the applicability of Rule 9(b) ""given that a defendant can violate the UCL, FAL, and CLRA by acting with 
mere negligence."" Id. at 1019 n.11. Although the Court noted that Rule 9(b) ""may"" not apply, the plaintiffs did not raise this issue 
and the court did not decide the issue. Id."
157,6," Additionally, in opposing Defendant's argument that they did not sufficiently plead a claim under Cal. Civ. Code § 1770(a)(9), 
Plaintiffs argue that they did sufficiently plead an intent to defraud. See Doc. No. 62 at 23 n.6 (citing FAC ¶¶ 11, 168, 186-87). In 
rebutting Defendant's motion, Plaintiffs also refer to the violation of the consumer protection acts as ""Plaintiffs' consumer fraud 
claims."" Id. at 26 (emphasis added). "
158,7," The Court notes that Plaintiffs' FAC takes issue with statements of ""no preservatives,"" ""free of artificial additives,"" and ""non-
GMO,"" which Plaintiffs collectively refer to as ""natural claims."" See FAC ¶¶ 10, 97, 115; id., Exh. A. Despite referring to ""all-
natural"" statements, Plaintiffs do not allege that ""all-natural"" is a misrepresentation or otherwise at-issue in this action. "
160,8," Defendant's reliance on Ballard v. Bhang Corp., No. EDCV 19-2329 JGB (KKx), 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 188626, 2020 WL 
6018939 (C.D. Cal. Sept. 25, 2020), is unsuccessful. In Ballard, the court granted a motion dismiss, requiring greater clarity as to 
""which chocolates [the plaintiff] bought, when he bought them, how they were advertised, and how they fell short—at the very 
least as to the chocolates that Plaintiff had lab-tested."" 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 188626, [WL] at *7. Here, Plaintiffs have provided 
the requisite clarity. See supra Section IV.B.1.ii."
160,9," The Court refers to ""packaging"" as both the physical packaging for Plaintiffs who purchased products in stores and the 
packaging images viewable online for Plaintiffs who purchased products online. The Court refers to ""other advertising"" as all 
nonpackaging advertisements found on Defendant's website, online store, blog, social media, Amazon.com pages, and Shark 
Tank episode that aired on ABC. "
165,10," Defendant asserts in their motion that ""[t]he boxes state exactly how much product is inside in weight, serving sizes, and often 
by final product output (muffins, cookies, brownies, protein balls, flapjacks/waffles etc.)."" Doc. No. 44-1 at 22 (emphasis omitted 
and added). Defendant appears to concede that not all of its product boxes state the final product yield."
165,11," For example, Defendant's pancake mixes only require water to be added. See, e.g., Doc. No. 44-3 at 1-2 (Buttermilk Flapjack 
and Pancake Mix). "
168,12," Plaintiffs appear to conflate other statements. These include statements that Plaintiffs do not allege were part of the at-issue 
marketing, such as ""all natural"" or ""synthetic."" See FAC ¶¶ 98, 99, 102-07, 114, 199. Because Plaintiffs limit the alleged 
misrepresentations to specific phrases, the Court does not address whether Plaintiffs allege that other phrases support a viable 
claim. See supra note 7. "
169,13," ""GMO"" is an acronym for ""genetically modified organism."" See FAC ¶ 109. "
171,14," Except for Plaintiff Stewart and for the reasons noted above regarding the lack of actual reliance, Plaintiffs do not plausibly 
allege their ""healthy"" theory of liability. See supra Section IV.B.1.iii. "
182,1," This immunity attaches only if the challenged restraint is ""clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed as state policy"" and 
""actively supervised"" by the state. California Retail Liquor Dealers Ass'n v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc., 445 U.S. 97, 105, 100 S. Ct. 
937, 63 L. Ed. 2d 233 (1980) (quoting City of Lafayette v. Louisiana Power & Light Co., 435 U.S. 389, 410, 98 S. Ct. 1123, 55 L. 
Ed. 2d 364 (1978)). The alleged contract between GTL and the IDOC satisfies that requirement. McGuire, v. Ameritech Servs., 
Inc., 253 F. Supp. 2d 988, 1007 (S.D. Ohio 2003) (holding that this kind of arrangement ""is the clear and articulated policy of [the 
state] . . . It is the State, acting through the [state agency], that solicited, implemented, and maintains"" the contracted services)."
182,2," It is unclear whether the streaming media offered by GTL are ""commodities"" covered by the statute. See Innomed Labs, LLC v. 
ALZA Corp., 368 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir. 2004) (the term ""commodity"" is strictly construed to exclude ""intangible"" products or 
services). "
186,1," Although Beemac Logistics appears in the caption, no injunctive relief was ordered against it. Accordingly, it is not involved in 
the instant appeal. "
187,2," The injunction entered in PLS's action against its former employees is not the subject of the instant appeal. Rather, PLS 
properly filed a separate appeal to the Superior Court which affirmed the trial court. Pittsburgh Logistics Sys., Inc. v. 
Ceravolo, 181 A.3d 412, 2017 Pa. Super. Unpub. LEXIS 4184, 2017 WL 5451759 (Pa. Super. 2017), petition for allowance of 
appeal denied, 646 Pa. 124, 183 A.3d 968 (Pa. 2018) (per curiam). "
188,3," A panel of the Superior Court affirmed the trial court on March 26, 2018. PLS sought reargument, which the court granted on 
June 6, 2018. "
196,4," Section 1 of The Sherman Act provides, in relevant part, ""Every contract . . . in restraint of trade or commerce among the 
several States, or with foreign nations, is declared illegal."" 15 U.S.C. § 1."

197,7," The six essential prerequisites are: (1) the injunction is necessary to prevent immediate and irreparable harm that cannot be 
adequately compensated by damages; (2) greater injury would result from refusing an injunction than from granting it; (3) the 
injunction will restore the parties to their status as it was immediately before the alleged wrongful conduct; (4) the activity sought "
198,," to be restrained is actionable, the right to relief is manifest, and the moving party must show it is likely to prevail on the merits; 
(5) the injunction is reasonably suited to abate the offending activity; and (6) a preliminary injunction will not harm the public 
interest. Warehime, 860 A.2d at 46-47."
198,8," This is consistent with the United States Department of Justice's (DOJ) approach to enforcing federal antitrust law. In 2016, 
the DOJ and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued guidance for human resources professionals explaining that non-ancillary 
no-poaching agreements between employers—short-handed as ""naked"" no-poach agreements—are per se illegal. DOJ/FTC 
Antitrust Guidance for HR Professionals (Oct. 2016), at 3, https://www.justice.gov/atr/file/903511/download. In contrast, the DOJ 
advised that legitimate joint ventures are not per se illegal and has advocated for the rule of reason to apply to ancillary 
restraints 
on 
trade.

199,9," On December 1, 2016, the trial court granted injunctive relief precluding Beemac from employing the former PLS employees. 
The injunction remained in effect for three weeks, until the trial court vacated it on December 22, 2016. "
210,1," The following facts are drawn from the parties' statements of undisputed material facts and responses pursuant to Local Rule 
56.1 (formerly Local Rule 7.1(a)(3)), (Dkt. Nos. 133-2, 134-2, 144-1, 146), to the extent those facts are well-supported by 
pinpoint citations to the record, as well as the exhibits attached thereto and cited therein to the extent they could ""be presented 
in a form that would be admissible in evidence"" at trial. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(2). In considering the parties' cross-motions for 
summary judgment, the Court ""in each case constru[es] the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party."" 
Krauss v. Oxford Health Plans, Inc., 517 F.3d 614, 621-22 (2d Cir. 2008). "
212,2," While Bard's TLS system combines ultrasound with navigation and confirmation technology, ""ultrasound is universally 
available,"" ""there are many [ultrasound systems] in the market,"" and a hospital can use any ultrasound system, including Bard's 
or another company's, in conjunction with Bard's TLS. (Dkt. No. 146, ¶ 21). "
213,3," In January 2017, Teleflex received FDA approval for a TLS that was based off the same technology that AngioDynamics would 
have used to develop Celerity with navigation. (Dkt. No. 144-1, ¶ 52). Several AngioDynamics executives have testified as to 
their frustration and disappointment that Teleflex outbid AngioDynamics for the Celerity technology, and their belief that 
navigation-enabled Celerity would have helped AngioDynamics compete in the PICC market. (Dkt. No. 133-2, ¶¶ 53-54; Dkt. No. 
144-1, ¶¶ 53-54). "
217,4," Bard contends that ""[m]ost of the hospital communications to Bard regarding standalone stylets came from nurses, not 
personnel making decisions about PICC purchases,"" but AngioDynamics disputes this characterization, citing record evidence 
that the decision-making process and the personnel involved varies by hospital. (Dkt. No. 133-2, ¶ 85; Dkt. No. 144-1, ¶ 85). "
230,5," Moreover, the fact that Bard sold single-sterile stylets to Cleveland Clinic for a price at which Bard appeared to make a fairly 
high margin, (Dkt. No. 138-79, at 3), does not definitively resolve the question of whether sufficient demand existed to allow Bard 
to efficiently sell the products separately to the market at large, given the record evidence suggesting that this price was based 
on factors specific to Cleveland Clinic and was discounted from the price at which Bard would have been able to offer its single-
sterile stylet to the market. (Dkt. No. 146, ¶ 48 (citing and summarizing record evidence)). "
233,6," Indeed, at oral argument, AngioDynamics' counsel agreed that, should the Court find a genuine dispute of material fact as to 
whether Bard's PICCs constitute a separate product from its TLSs, it should also find a factual dispute as to the proper market 
definition for purposes of the ""market power"" element."
233,7," AngioDynamics argues that Professor Scott Morton's opinion is based on the premise that there is no separate use for TLSs 
independent of their use with PICCs, and that this premise is contrary to law because ""[t]he Supreme Court and courts in this 
Circuit have repeatedly held . . . that it does not matter whether 'there is no separate use' for the tying product."" (Dkt. No. 152, at 
11 (citing Park, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2001, at *10-11, 2007 WL 119461, at *4; Kodak, 504 U.S. at 463)). AngioDynamics is 
correct that the mere fact that two products are interdependent does not preclude a finding that they are separate products or 
exist in separate antitrust markets. However, Professor Scott Morton's opinion is not based merely on the fact that Bard's TLSs 
have no use separate from Bard's PICCs. Rather, she opines that consumers ""do not evaluate the price of [a TLS] stylet in 
comparison with the price of other stylets,"" but rather ""evaluate the price of that stylet paired with a PICC in comparison with 
other combinations of stylets and PICCs,"" and ""choose the differentiated PICC system that best suits its needs based on the 
system's overall features and price."" (Dkt. No. 147-13, at 15). Professor Scott Morton concludes that, ""[b]ecause the relevant 
competition between manufacturers occurs at the differentiated PICC level and not at the TLS or TLS stylet level . . . there is not 
a separate relevant product market for TLSs."" (Id. at 16). "
235,8," The Court recognizes that AngioDynamics' damages expert, Dr. Frankel, puts forth a number of estimates of AngioDynamics' 
lost profits that resulted from Bard's TLS policy. If proven, any one of these estimates would far exceed the low threshold to 
allow this Court to find that a ""not insubstantial"" amount of commerce has been foreclosed, without even accounting for other 
PICC competitors' lost sales. (Dkt. No. 132-5, at 45). However, these lost profits estimates are obviously in dispute, and given 
that (as discussed below) there are genuine disputes of material fact as to whether any of AngioDynamics' lost profits may be 
fairly attributed to Bard's TLS policy, these estimates cannot, at this stage, serve as a basis for granting summary judgment in 
AngioDynamics' favor."
235,9," As they did at the motion to dismiss stage, the parties disagree on whether AngioDynamics must prove anticompetitive effects 
as an element of its per se claim, as distinct from its rule of reason claim. (Dkt. No. 134-1, at 24-25; Dkt. No. 145, at 22 n.26; 
Dkt. No. 152, at 14 & n.8). Because the Court has found that genuine disputes of material fact exist as to the other elements of 
AngioDynamics' claim under either a per se or rule of reason theory, a decision on this issue would not affect the Court's 
ultimate decision on either party's motion for summary judgment. Therefore, the Court does not address this issue. "
238,10," The court also found that the third-party salespersons' ""statements explaining why the company did not intend to do business 
with [the plaintiff] [were] expressly outside the state-of-mind exception"" because they constituted ""statement[s] of memory or 
belief to prove the fact remembered or believed."" 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6864, at *4-5, 2009 WL 235648, at *2. In Amerisource, 
there was ""no dispute"" that the hearsay statements were being offered not only to prove the third-party company's motivations, 
but also to prove the facts underlying those motives, i.e. ""that [the defendant] said [plaintiff] was a bad credit risk."" 2009 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 6864, at *3, [WL] at *1. Here, to the extent AngioDynamics offers evidence of customers' then-existing states of mind 
solely to show its customers' motivations for switching away from or declining to purchase AngioDynamics' PICCs, and not for 
the fact of lost sales itself or the truth of the underlying facts asserted in those customers' statements, the evidence would be 
admissible under Rule 803(3) for that purpose. "
240,11," Citing case law from other Circuits, AngioDynamics argues that the relaxed standard of proof typically applied to the amount of 
damages in antitrust cases also applies to the element of antitrust injury, and that an antitrust plaintiff need only prove a ""trifle of 
injury"" resulting from the defendant's conduct in order to satisfy this element. (Dkt. No. 134-1, at 27-29; Dkt. No. 144, at 12-13; 
Dkt. No. 152, at 15-16 (relying on In re Data Gen. Corp. Antitrust Litig., 490 F. Supp. at 1117-18; In re K-Dur Antitrust Litig., No. 
01-cv-1652, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 71772, at *21-22, 2008 WL 2660776, at *4 (D.N.J. Feb. 21, 2008); Digidyne Corp. v. Data 
Gen. Corp., 734 F.2d 1336, 1339 n.1 (9th Cir. 1984))). The Court applies the Second Circuit's standard for evaluating antitrust 
injury, as set forth above, and declines to follow the cases AngioDynamics cites to the extent they are inconsistent with that 
standard."
240,12," Pursuant to a stipulation dated April 17, 2020, the parties agreed that neither party will call at trial any witnesses from third-
party hospitals, hospital groups or representatives, except for two witnesses from Cleveland Clinic who have already been 
deposed. (Dkt. No. 136-27). "
241,13," The parties also present arguments as to whether the testimony of AngioDynamics' causation and damages expert, Dr. 
Frankel, is sufficient to establish injury-in-fact or causation. (Dkt. No. 133-1, at 17-24, 26-32; Dkt. No. 134-1, at 33; Dkt. No. 144, 
at 17, 24-26; Dkt. No. 154, at 14-16). For the reasons explained in Section IV.C.1 of this Decision, the Court is granting Bard's 
motion to exclude Dr. Frankel's causation opinion. Therefore, the Court does not consider Dr. Frankel's opinion in connection 
with its injury-in-fact or causation analysis and, consequently, does not address Bard's specific critiques of his opinion or 
AngioDynamics' responses here."
241,14, No parallel LEXIS citation available. 
242,15," Bard attempts to distinguish Callahan on the ground that Callahan ""featured extensive [expert] economic evidence on injury 
and causation that bolstered the plaintiffs' testimony."" (Dkt. No. 154, at 9-10). While the Court is not considering Dr. Frankel's 
opinion on causation, and this case is thus distinguishable from Callahan in that respect, this distinction is not dispositive. While 
the Callahan court considered the evidence before it collectively, nowhere did it suggest that the evidence would have been 
insufficient to raise a triable issue of fact without the expert analysis, and it is well-established that a plaintiff may prove antitrust 
injury without the use of expert evidence. See, e.g., Smith Wholesale Co., 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25184, 2005 WL 8162569, at 
*5 (""Contrary to defendant's insistence, expert testimony is not necessarily required to prove antitrust injury if the facts and 
circumstances otherwise fall within the ambit of F.R.E. 701, and here they do.""); Cason-Merenda v. Detroit Med. Ctr., 862 F. 
Supp. 2d 603, 642-43 (E.D. Mich. 2012) (""Plaintiffs correctly note that they may forge the necessary link between Defendants' 
alleged antitrust violations and antitrust injury without expert testimony.""); Valassis Communs., Inc. v. News Corp., No. 17-cv-
7378, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27770, at *37, 2019 WL 802093, at *12 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 21, 2019) (""Any defect in [the plaintiff's 
damages expert's] opinion on the amount of damages does not undermine [the plaintiff's] ability to prove the fact of injury.""). 
Here, the Court finds that the record as it stands is sufficient to raise a genuine dispute as to injury-in-fact and causation; 
whether that evidence is enough to prove AngioDynamics' case is a question for trial. Bard's attempt to distinguish Complete 
Entm't Resources on the grounds that that case ""concerns 'records of customer statements' rather than plaintiff's own testimony 
and deals with admissibility rather than sufficiency"" is also inapposite. (Dkt. No. 154, at 10 n.4). Here, AngioDynamics relies on 
both its own witnesses' testimony and documentary evidence regarding its customers' motivations, and the court in Complete 
Entm't Resources was not dealing solely with admissibility, but rather was (as here) considering whether there was sufficient 
admissible evidence in the record to raise a triable issue of fact as to antitrust injury. Id."
242,16," The line of cases Bard cites for the proposition that the ""'isolated self-serving statements' of a plaintiff's corporate officers may 
not provide substantial evidence upon which a jury can rely"" is inapposite, as those cases involved conclusory statements by 
officers that found no support in, and in many cases flatly contradicted, the evidence in the record. See Argus Inc. v. Eastman 
Kodak Co., 801 F.2d 38, 41-46 (2d Cir. 1986); Chrysler Credit Corp. v. J. Truett Payne Co., 670 F.2d 575, 581-82 (5th Cir. 
1982). By contrast, the witness testimony here regarding lost sales and the reasons for those losses, as a general matter, is not 
inconsistent with, and finds some support in, the documentary evidence. See Section II.E.5 supra (reviewing evidence). "
243,17," In a similar vein, Bard also argues that customers' statements to AngioDynamics regarding their reasons for not purchasing 
AngioDynamics' PICCs (even if admissible to show the customers' motivations) are inherently unreliable. (Dkt. No. 133-1, at 16-
17). AngioDynamics takes issue with this characterization. (Dkt. No. 144, at 18-20). These arguments concern the weight the 
relevant evidence should be given, and are best resolved by a fact-finder at trial rather than at the summary judgment stage."
243,18," While the Court need not address each of Bard's arguments with respect to the various factors it cites, there is one argument 
Bard makes that the Court sees fit to briefly address. Bard argues that the failure of AngioDynamics and its damages expert to 
account for the fact that Bard had not obtained FDA approval to market its TLS stylet for use with competitors' valved PICCs is 
fatal to any claim it has with respect to valved PICC sales, citing case law for the proposition that a ""regulatory or legislative bar 
can break the chain of causation in an antitrust case."" (Dkt. No. 133-1, at 31-32 (citing In re Wellbutrin XL Antitrust Litig., 868 
F.3d 132, 165 (3d Cir. 2017); In re Ciprofloxacin Hydrochloride Antitrust Litig., 261 F. Supp. 2d 188, 206 (E.D.N.Y. 2003)). Even 
assuming (without deciding) that the case law Bard cites applies here, it does not defeat AngioDynamics' claim of antitrust injury; 
this lack of FDA approval is not a factor for the large number of AngioDynamics' PICC sales that involve non-valved PICCs. "
244,19," In a similar vein, the Court need not address the parties' arguments over whether a survey of hospitals or interviews of hospital 
representatives—which neither AngioDynamics nor its experts conducted—would have been appropriate in this case. (Dkt. No. 
133-1, at 13, 19-20; Dkt. No. 144, at 24-25; Dkt. No. 154, at 15-16). The question for the Court is whether the record as it stands 
raises triable issues of material fact, and the Court finds that it does. "
245,20," Bard objects to AngioDynamics' reliance on a chart purportedly showing AngioDynamics' share of particular PICC market 
segments, arguing that it ""appears nowhere in Frankel's reports,"" was compiled by ""AngioDynamics' lawyers pull[ing] numbers 
from three different appendices to Frankel's reports and perform[ing] additional calculations,"" is based on unreliable data, and 
was not timely disclosed as an expert opinion. (Dkt. No. 153, at 7-8 & n.4). For purposes of the parties' summary judgment 
motions, the Court need not decide whether or not consideration of this demonstrative is appropriate, as it finds that neither party 
is entitled to summary judgment whether or not the demonstrative is considered. "
246,21," Bard analogizes to a Tenth Circuit case, Suture Express, Inc. v. Owens & Minor Distribution, Inc., 851 F.3d 1029, 1044 (10th 
Cir. 2017), in which the Court observed that significant evidence of a ""market that is becoming more, not less, competitive"" 
""raise[d] questions about . . . whether it was really competition that was harmed instead of simply one competitor,"" and found 
that ""[t]here is simply not enough probative evidence for a jury to find that [the defendants'] bundling practices constitute an 
injury of the kind the antitrust laws are intended to prevent."" Id. at 1045. Here, while the record contains some indicia of a 
competitive PICC marketplace, see Section IV.A.5 supra, there is also evidence that Bard's TLS policy prevents competitors like 
AngioDynamics from being able to meaningfully compete for PICC customers that use Bard's TLS, and that Bard dominates the 
market (especially with respect to PICCs that use TLSs) to a much greater extent than any defendant in Suture Express. Thus, 
unlike in Suture Express, then, the evidence of robust competition notwithstanding Bard's TLS policy is not so overwhelming as 
to preclude a finding that Bard's actions have harmed competition in the market. "
247,22," In the following discussion, the Court summarizes only the portions of Dr. Frankel's opinions that are relevant to the pending 
motions. "
248,23," While AngioDynamics disavows any claim that it markets BioFlo PICCs as having ""antithrombotic"" properties and clarifies that 
it only claims BioFlo PICCs reduce ""thrombus accumulation,"" (Dkt. No. 144-1, ¶¶ 34-36), Dr. Frankel uses the term 
""antithrombotic properties"" throughout his report. "
249,24," AngioDynamics argues that Namenda is distinguishable because there ""the Court excluded the testimony of an expert who 
failed to analyze contemporaneous documents and data and instead relied only on her industry experience and fact witness 
testimony in forming her opinion,"" whereas ""Dr. Frankel analyzed contemporaneous documents and data and reached a 
conclusion based on that analysis."" (Dkt. No. 143, at 19). Bard points out that this distinction ignores the fact that the Namenda 
court ""excluded the expert's testimony both because the expert failed to rely on sufficient facts or data, and for a separate 
reason (that Bard cites)—the proposed expert testimony would simply regurgitate information that could be introduced through 
fact witnesses."" (Dkt. No. 153, at 7 n.3). The Court agrees with Bard."
249,25," Because the Court has found that Dr. Frankel's causation opinion must be excluded on the foregoing grounds, it need not 
address the parties' remaining arguments regarding that opinion. To the extent these arguments amount to disputes over "
250,," whether the record supports a finding of causation, the Court has addressed this question in resolving the parties' cross-motions 
for summary judgment on antitrust injury. See Section IV.B supra."
250,26," At oral argument, AngioDynamics' counsel suggested that Dr. Frankel's other potential ""indicators"" could serve as a basis for a 
damages model if the Court excludes Dr. Frankel's benchmarking analysis; Bard's counsel disagreed. (Dkt. No. 187, at 64-67, "
251,81," -82). As Bard has only moved to exclude Dr. Frankel's benchmarking analysis, the Court only addresses the issue that has 
been presented and briefed by the parties. "
254,27," At oral argument, the parties disputed whether the percent figure Dr. Frankel independently calculated should be reduced in 
order to represent the percentage of total (as opposed to standalone) Teleflex TLS stylets that are sold for use in 
AngioDynamics' PICCs. (Dkt. No. 185, at 44, 78-79). This issue was not addressed in the parties' briefing, and the Court does 
not address it here, as it makes no difference to the Court's analysis. "
255,28," As to Benchmark 1, Bard contends that ""the percentage of Teleflex's stylets [paired with AngioDynamics' PICCs] would have 
been far lower in the but-for world because some hospitals currently using them with AngioDynamics' PICCs would have shifted 
to Bard's superior TLS,"" and thus using this figure as a benchmark overstates the percentage of Bard's TLS stylets that would be 
combined with AngioDynamics' PICCs in the but-for world. (Dkt. No. 132-1, at 18-21; Dkt. No. 153, at 8-11). As to Benchmark 2, 
Bard contends that ""the higher the number of AngioDynamics PICCs paired with Teleflex TLS, the smaller the relative advantage 
Teleflex has in selling its PICCs to its own TLS users as compared to nurses who place PICCs without TLS, which inflates 
Benchmark 2."" (Dkt. No. 132-1, at 20 n.15). "
256,29," As noted, Bard also argues that courts have excluded benchmarking analyses where it found the proposed benchmarks to be 
""tainted"" by the alleged misconduct at issue. However, the cases Bard cites for this proposition are distinguishable, as in 
contrast to Dr. Frankel, the excluded experts in those cases sought to use a defendant's anticompetitive profits as a benchmark 
for measuring the profits a competitor plaintiff would have made but for the defendant's conduct—in essence, seeking to reap 
the fruit of the defendant's anticompetitive conduct to provide a windfall to the plaintiff. See, e.g., Farmington Dowel Prod. Co. 
v. Forster Mfg. Co., 421 F.2d 61, 82 & n.48 (1969); Admiral Theatre Corp. v. Douglas Theatre Co., 437 F. Supp. 1268, 1297-99 
(D. Neb. 1977), modified, 585 F.2d 877 (8th Cir. 1978); cf. In re Urethane Antitrust Litig., No. 04-cv-1616, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
181506, at *42, 2012 WL 6681783, at *6 (D. Kan. Dec. 21, 2012) (""[C]riticisms of [an expert's] consideration of possible taint 
from a conspiracy of potential benchmark years go to the weight of his opinions and not their admissibility.""), aff'd 768 F.3d 1245 
(10th Cir. 2014). "
261,1," In Kline the Ninth Circuit considered whether the superiority requirement of Rule 23(b)(3) precluded class certification of an 
antitrust class whose members had engaged in 400,000 to 800,000 transactions, generating excess commissions and treble 
damages in the amount of $1,875 per transaction, or an aggregate of at least $750,000,000 in damages. Kline 508 F. 2d at 234 
& n. 5. The court noted that although these damages were contemplated by the statute, the ""amounts [were] staggering"" in the 
class certification context. Id. The court also noted that comparable cases, where putative class members sought ""outrageous 
amounts in statutory penalty cases,"" were similarly denied class action status. Id. at 234. "
262,2," Other courts have held that an antitrust action survives the death of a defendant. See, e.g., Sullivan v. Associated Billposters & 
Distributors of United States and Canada, 6 F.2d 1000, 1012 (2d Cir.1925) (explaining that a cause of action under the Sherman 
Act based on ""acts which deprive one of his trade and diminish his profits certainly directly affect his business and may destroy 
it"" survives the death of the defendant); Fishman v. Estate of Wirtz, 807 F.2d 520, 560-61 (7th Cir. 1986) (awarding treble 
damages based on violation of federal antitrust law despite the defendant's death). "
310,1," ""Courts may consider the RICO case statement in assessing whether plaintiffs' RICO claims should be dismissed."" Glessner v. 
Kenny, 952 F.2d 702, 712 n. 9 (3d Cir.1991), overruled on other grounds by Jaguar Cars, Inc. v. Royal Oaks Motor Car Co., 46 
F.3d 258, 260 (3d Cir.1995). "
312,2," Plaintiff brings his constitutional tort claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, which ""provides a cause of action against state actors who 
violate an individual's rights under federal law."" Filarsky v. Delia, 566 U.S. 377, 380, 132 S. Ct. 1657, 182 L. Ed. 2d 662 (2012). 
Section 1983 does not create substantive rights but instead ""provides only remedies for deprivations of rights established 
elsewhere in the Constitution or federal laws."" Kneipp v. Tedder, 95 F.3d 1199, 1204 (3d Cir. 1996). ""To state a claim under § 
1983, a plaintiff must allege the violation of a right secured by the Constitution and laws of the United States, and must show that 
the alleged deprivation was committed by a person acting under color of state law."" West v. Atkins, 487 U.S. 42, 48, 108 S. Ct. 
2250, 101 L. Ed. 2d 40 (1988). "
315,3," Plaintiff avers that following the May 4, 2019 incident, during his subsequent stay in the L-Unit, his legal paperwork related to 
his civil action at No. 1:15-cv-312 was removed from his cell and destroyed. (Amend. Compl. ¶ 43.) As set forth above, however, 
the Amended Complaint does not identify who was involved in removing those documents."
315,4," In his response to Defendants' motion, Plaintiff contends that the defendants involved in the alleged excessive force incidents, 
alleged sexual assault incident, and in the incident in which the paperclip was placed in Plaintiff's food are not entitled to 
immunity. The claims against the defendants involved in these incidents are not claims of negligence, however. Rather, if 
Plaintiff's allegations against these defendants are true, they violated Plaintiff's Eighth Amendment rights and/or committed state 
law intentional torts such as assault and battery but do not implicate a negligence cause of action. "
317,5," The Court notes that although Plaintiff alleges that the legal documents for his case at No. 1:15-cv-312 were taken from him in 
May 2019, he had an attorney in that case as of May 8, 2019. "
322,1," While the subject motion concerns Ageless' counterclaims and affirmative defense, the court includes details from the operative 
Complaint solely for additional context and does not presume the allegations in the Complaint are true. "
323,2," Ageless asserts ""Edge's claims are barred because they are illegal and constitute unlawful tying in violation of federal and state 
antitrust laws."" Dkt. 14 at 10 (""FAAC Affirmative Defenses"") ¶ 9. Ageless cites to ""the California Copyright Act § 16700 et. seq."" 
(italics in original), by which Ageless presumably intended to cite the Cartwright Act, California's state antitrust statute, codified at 
Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 16700 et seq. The analysis under the Cartwright Act mirrors the analysis under federal law because the 
Cartwright Act was modeled after the Sherman Act. Cnty. of Tuolumne v. Sonora Cmty. Hosp., 236 F.3d 1148, 1160 (9th Cir. 
2001). Thus, the court will only address Ageless' claims under the Sherman Act. "
324,3," Because the Trademark License Agreement forms the basis of Ageless' counterclaims and affirmative defense and Ageless 
refers extensively to the Agreement in its counterclaims, the court incorporates the Agreement (Dkt. 1-2) into Ageless' 
counterclaims. See Ritchie, 342 F.3d at 908 (""Even if a document is not attached to a complaint, it may be incorporated by 
reference into a complaint if the plaintiff refers extensively to the document or the document forms the basis of the plaintiff's 
claim.""). "
325,4," A plaintiff that fails to state a per se unlawful tying claim may still prevail under the rule of reason. See Jefferson Par. Hosp. 
Dist. No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 29, 104 S. Ct. 1551, 80 L. Ed. 2d 2 (1984), overruled on other grounds by Ill. Tool Works Inc. v. 
Indep. Ink, Inc., 547 U.S. 28, 31, 126 S. Ct. 1281, 164 L. Ed. 2d 26 (2006). ""[T]he inquiry mandated by the Rule of Reason is 
whether the challenged agreement is one that promotes competition or one that suppresses competition."" Nat'l Soc'y of Prof'l 
Eng'rs v. United States, 435 U.S. 679, 691 (1978). "
326,5," Plaintiff Edge additionally argues its trademarks cannot qualify as a separate tying product under Krehl, 664 F.2d 1348 (9th Cir. 
1982). Mot. Br. 11-14. Ageless responds the counterclaim does not allege Edge's trademark, but rather Edge's skincare device, 
is the tying product. Opp. at 11-13. As Ageless expressly asserts it is not alleging the existence of a tie between Edge's serums 
and its trademarks, the court need not address the parties' arguments regarding Krehl. "
327,6," Ageless argues Edge's Complaint suffers from the same defect but does not cite any authority for the proposition that Ageless 
is entitled to avoid dismissal because Edge's Complaint purportedly does not name specific contractual relationships in 
connection with Edge's interference claim. Opp. at 22. "
337,1, All docket entries refer to the docket in C.A. No. 16-046.
337,2," Defendants make much of the term ""health plans"" as overly vague, but Plaintiffs clarify that it is used as a synonym for ""third-

expenses (e.g., pharmaceutical purchases)."" Pls.' Reply 18. In this opinion, ""TPPs"" and ""health plans"" are used interchangeably."

340,6," Caremark argues that Illinois law, not federal law, applies to this dispute. Caremark Reply 8-9. While the Court need not reach 
the issue, the First Circuit has signaled that litigation-conduct waiver is an issue of federal law. See Rankin v. Allstate Ins. Co., 
336 F.3d 8, 12 n.3 (1st Cir. 2003) (noting that, while not argued, ""arbitration-related issues in this case are probably governed by 
the"" FAA and, if so, ""federal law would automatically govern waiver issues"" (citation omitted)). Under either body of law, the 
result here is the same. See LRN Holding, Inc. v. Windlake Capital Advisors, LLC, 409 Ill. App. 3d 1025, 949 N.E.2d 264, 270-
72, 350 Ill. Dec. 776 (Ill. App. 3d Dist. 2011) (noting that, under Illinois law, where a contract contains a choice-of-law provision 
and incorporates the American Arbitration Association rules of arbitration, federal law applies to questions regarding arbitration). "
341,7," Caremark further highlights that the current version of the AAA's Commercial Rules states that ""[n]o judicial proceeding by a 
party relating to the subject matter of the arbitration shall be deemed a waiver of the party's right to arbitrate."" Caremark Reply 5 
(quoting American Arbitration Association, Commercial Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures, Rule 52(a) (2013)). 
However, the AAA's Commercial Rules contained this same language when the First Circuit decided Marie, and thus, this 
argument is not persuasive. See In re Intuniv Antitrust Litig., 2021 WL 517386, at *8. Moreover, one could interpret the text 
""judicial proceeding by a party"" as denoting that a plaintiff does not waive its right to arbitrate by filing suit. But in any event, the 
Rules only govern arbitration, they have no bearing on the Court's determinations. "
342,8," While Caremark makes much of putting Sheet Metal Workers on notice of its intent to arbitrate by asserting it as an affirmative 
defense, this Motion is the first time Caremark properly asserted its right. See In re Citigroup, Inc., 376 F.3d 23, 27 (1st Cir. 
2004) (noting that HN4[
] it is not sufficient to assert in an answer the right to arbitrate as an affirmative defense)."
342,9," The Court does understand Sheet Metal Workers to argue that CVS conducted discovery that would not have been available at 
arbitration and that CVS and Caremark have the same attorneys. See Feb. 27, 2020 Hr'g Tr. 123-24, ECF No. 170. While the 
Court is sympathetic to the realities of this situation, it is not confident that Sheet Metal Workers would have found itself in any 
different of a position had Caremark asserted its arbitration right earlier. Presumably CVS and Sheet Metal Workers would have 
engaged in that same discovery. "
343,10," Neither party argues that a stay, rather than dismissal, is the more appropriate remedy. See Dialysis Access Ctr., LLC v. RMS 
Lifeline, Inc., 638 F.3d 367, 372 (1st Cir. 2011) (noting thatHN6[
]  a district court has the discretion to dismiss claims where 
one party has a right to arbitrate all claims (citing Next Step Med. Co. v. Johnson & Johnson Int'l, 619 F.3d 67, 71 (1st Cir. 
2010))). "
345,11," Defendants also advance this argument as to Caremark in pressing its Motion to Dismiss. See Feb. 27, 2020 Hr'g Tr. 110:20-
111:2, ECF No. 170. The argument fails for the same reasons it fails as to OptumRx and MedImpact. "
348,12," Dr. Conti is an Associate Research Director of Biopharma & Public Policy for the Boston University Institute for Health System 
Innovation & Policy, an Associate Professor at the Boston University Questrom School of Business, Department of Markets, 
Public Policy and Law, and an Academic Affiliate of Greylock McKinnon Associates. Expert Report of Rena Conti, ¶ 1, ECF No. 
123-6. She received a B.A. from Kenyon College and a Ph.D. in Health Policy (Economics Track) from Harvard University. Id. ¶ 
5. Defendants do not dispute her qualifications to offer expert opinion. They do, however, offer counter expert opinion."
348,13," To the extent Plaintiffs assert that (challenged) testimonial affidavits and declarations from class members may be used to 
establish class membership, Pls.' Reply 15 (citing In re Dial Complete Mktg. and Sales Practices Litig., 312 F.R.D. 36, 50 
(D.N.H. 2015)), they are incorrect. See In re Asacol Antitrust Litig., 907 F.3d 42, 52-53 (1st Cir. 2018) (rejecting rebutted, 
testimonial affidavits as proof of injury at class certification)."
348,14, [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] 
349,15," The Court is not convinced that any differences in the contracts' U&C pricing provisions render this exercise unmanageable. 
To the extent the parties need to litigate whether certain TPPs' contract language entitled them to U&C pricing, Defs.' Opp'n 23 & "
350,," n.6, this can be done in subclasses. If Defendants have actual proof that some contracts are ambiguous (which the Court 
understands to not be Defendants' primary merits position) the Court will proceed to develop subclasses to litigate individual 
issues. The Court always has the option of decertifying a class where such an inquiry proves overwhelming; that said, at this 
point, Plaintiffs have met their burden in establishing that the classes are ascertainable. "
351,16," Indeed, Defendants themselves compiled a chart purporting to reflect the individual issues at play in 39 MedImpact contracts 
proposed in this case. See Defs.' App'x B, ECF No. 133-1. In doing so, they also demonstrate that each of these issues is 
capable of resolution before trial. "
354,17," To the extent Defendants argue that CVS's alleged fraudulent pricing scheme cannot be the proximate cause of overpayment 
under the civil RICO statute because it did not ""directly"" lead to the violation, Defs.' Opp'n 39, the Court rejects the argument. As 
pleaded, and given the record before the court on class certification, Plaintiffs have plainly established that the putative class 
members were ""the primary and intended victim[s] of the scheme to defraud, and that the injury suffered was a foreseeable and 
natural consequence of the fraudulent scheme."" In re Neurontin Mktg. & Sales Practices Litig., 712 F.3d 51, 58 (1st Cir. 2013) 
(internal quotations and citations omitted). "
356,18," To fall within one of the class definitions, a TPP need only have suffered an injury during the class period; a TPP may not have 
incurred damages in any one single calendar year, but still aptly be included in one of the classes for injury incurred during 
another year covered by the class period. "
359,19," The data cover thirteen states and the District of Columbia. For ease of reference, the Court refers to them as the ""14 states"" 
in this decision."
359,20," While Defendants have not yet filed a Daubert motion to exclude Dr. Conti's expert opinion, it was inescapable for the Court to 
consider the soundness of her methodology in determining whether damages are capable of measurement on a class-wide 
basis and tied to Plaintiffs' liability theory. Moreover, the Court considered the expert reports offered by Defendants criticizing Dr. 
Conti's report. The Court otherwise DENIES WITHOUT PREJUDICE the Motions as premature and will consider them once 
refiled as the case proceeds. See Pls.' Mots. to Exclude the Expert Testimony of Brett E. Barlag, Catherine Graeff, Michael P. 
Salve, Ph.D., ECF Nos. 140-42. To the extent those reports conclude Dr. Conti's methodology is unreliable or inaccurate, the 
Court disagrees for the reasons set forth herein; the Court understands the experts as largely offering competing views that go 
to the weight, and not admissibility, of the opinion. See Ruiz-Troche v. Pepsi Cola of Puerto Rico Bottling Co., 161 F.3d 77, 85 
(1st Cir. 1998) (""Daubert neither requires nor empowers trial courts to determine which of several competing scientific theories 
has the best provenance. It demands only that the proponent of the evidence show that the expert's conclusion has been arrived 
at in a scientifically sound and methodologically reliable fashion."" (citation omitted)). "
361,21," Defendants' other criticisms are sufficiently addressed in Dr. Conti's Reply Report. See Conti Reply ¶ 48 (adjusting model to 
exclude claims that may have been paid based on formulas that do not include U&C pricing); id. ¶¶ 52-53 (adjusting model to 
account for patient payment structures). And as addressed at length above, the Court is satisfied that Dr. Conti's damages 
model can accurately and reliably account for GERs. "
362,22," The Court gives Plaintiffs fifteen days from the entry of this order to show cause why the Unfair and Deceptive Conduct 
Consumer Protection Class definition should not be amended to exclude health plans that paid for generic prescription drugs in 
New Jersey, Ohio, and Iowa, as Defendants assert these state laws were never pleaded in the Amended Complaint and/or were 
dropped earlier in this suit. See Defs.' Sur-Reply 27. "
373,1," Plaintiffs Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha and NYK Line (North America) Inc. (together, the ""NYK plaintiffs""), whose complaint 
was among those targeted by defendants' motions to dismiss, see Tolling Decision, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 153826, 2020 WL 
5016922, at *8-9, sought clarification or reconsideration of the Tolling Decision's determination that their ""allegations about [a] 
2009-2013 contract"" between NYK plaintiffs and defendants that they claimed contained the same artificially high fuel surcharge 
as contracts entered during the 2003-2008 conspiracy period ""are time-barred,"" 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 153826, [WL] at *27; see 
In re Rail Freight Fuel Surcharge Antitrust Litig. (No. II) (""NYK Recons. Decision""), MDL No. 2925, Misc. A. No. 20-00008 (BAH),

denied on the grounds, previously articulated in the Tolling Decision, that ""allegations concerning a supracompetitive fuel 
surcharge formula in a 2009 contract do not satisfy the criteria for tolling because they are 'factually separate from the 2003-
2008 conspiracy pursued by the putative class' in MDL I and defendants therefore did not have fair notice that the contract was 
at issue."" NYK Recons. Decision, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 195908, 2020 WL 6198487, at *2 (quoting Tolling Decision, 2020 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 153826, 2020 WL 5016922, at *27)."
373,2," MDL I was filed in November 2007, see Transfer Order, MDL I, MDL No. 1869, No. 07-mc-00489-PLF-GMH (D.D.C. Nov. 14, 
2007), ECF No. 1, more than a year before the class-period end date of December 31, 2008, and discovery began in late 2008, 
after disposition of defendants' motion to dismiss, see In re Rail Freight Fuel Surcharge Antitrust Litig., 587 F. Supp. 2d 27, 37 "
374,," (D.D.C. 2008); Feb. 4 Status Conf. Tr. at 15:2-10. Of course, post-2008 lingering-effects damages had not yet occurred at that 
time. As a result, the central focus of discovery in MDL I was defendants' allegedly conspiratorial conduct and damages incurred 
by plaintiffs during the 2003-2008 class period. See Feb. 4 Status Conf. Tr. at 15:22-16:15."
374,3," A price authority, in the rail-freight context, is a ""[c]ontract, quote, circular, or tariff containing rates and rules governing their 
application."" Jaffe Decl., Ex. 2, Ass'n of Am. R.R.s, Railway Accounting Rules (""R.R. Rules"") 59 (2021), ECF No. 543-3 
(emphasis omitted). "
375,4," An ""evergreen contract is a contract that simply renews each year unless canceled by one of the parties,"" May 6 Hr'g Tr. at 
64:8-10 (statement by Ronald K. Wray, II, Gallivan, White & Boyd, P.A., Counsel for Defendant Norfolk Southern Railway Co.), 
while an ""open offer of transportation"" is an offer published by a railroad, for example, on its ""website,"" via ""a circular,"" or through 
""some other mechanism"" that ""a shipper can accept"" by placing an order for rail-freight transportation under the offer, id. at 65:5-
15 (statement by Mr. Wray). "
377,5," Plaintiffs originally requested that defendants be compelled to produce all price authorities applicable to plaintiffs ""by May 1, 
2021,"" Pls.' Mot. at 1, but subsequently extended that request to ""June 1,"" Pls.' Reply at 24 n.9. In addition, though plaintiffs 
represented that they sought to compel production of ""their own post-2008 transaction data and transaction data for which no 
shipper is identified"" through their pending motion, id. at 3 n.2, they clarified at the May 6, 2021 motions hearing that they are ""no 
longer asking for"" unidentified shipper data, May 6 Hr'g Tr. at 36:9; see also id. at 36:6-10, 37:12-15. "
382,6," Plaintiffs stated at the May 6, 2021 motions hearing that they ""don't understand what an evergreen contract is and we don't 
know that we have any,"" May 6 Hr'g Tr. at 42:4-5, and that they are ""not clear on what [an open offer of transportation] is,"" id. at 
42:21. In their March 2, 2021 letter to defendants, however, plaintiffs disputed ""Defendants' characterization"" of open offers of 
transportation and evergreen contracts ""as not being 'bilateral contracts,'"" and ""reserve[d] their rights to request any relevant 
data demonstrate lingering effects . . . whether based on open offers of transportation, evergreen contracts, or other price 
authorities,"" Pls' Lingering-Effects Letter at 2, suggesting that plaintiffs have some familiarity with these terms of art and have not 
disclaimed the possibility of recovering lingering-effects damages under these types of price authorities. "
383,7," An ""interline"" is ""[a] rail shipment involving two or more linehaul carriers,"" R.R. Rules, supra, at 58 (emphasis omitted), which 
are ""rail carrier[s] that collect[] or receive[] revenue . . . for the movement of freight between two stations that are not located with 
the switch limits of each other,"" id. at 59 (emphasis omitted). An interline contract thus is a contract for a shipment from an 
originating destination to a final destination, as to which a railroad other than the originating railroad carries the shipment part of 
the way. "
384,8," Plaintiffs assert that ""the Court held at the hearing on March 26, 2021 that Plaintiffs are not foreclosed from seeking damages 
under price authorities issued by other railroads and said that limited discovery may be subsequently obtained if a Plaintiff seeks 
such damages."" Pls.' Reply at 29 n.12 (citing Tr. of Disc. Dispute (Mar. 26, 2021) (""Mar. 26 Hr'g Tr."") at 65-67, ECF No. 557). No 
such holding was reached. The March 26, 2021 hearing concerned a request by defendants, in part, to compel production of 
information about fuel surcharges paid by plaintiffs to defendants' competitors during the conspiracy period. See Email from 
Luke von Houwelingen, Defs.' Counsel, to the Court (Mar. 18, 2021, 12:48 PM), at 1-2, ECF No. 556. In rejecting that request, 
the Court said: ""To the extent that defendants intend to use information about other railroads' fuel surcharges at the damages 
stage to rebut particular plaintiffs' claims about the degree to which they paid more for shipping than they otherwise would have 
paid due to the alleged conspiracy, discovery can be reopened as to a refined set of data and contracts relevant to the damages 
claims of specific plaintiffs at that time."" Mar. 26 Hr'g Tr. at 65:16-23. While the Court noted that ""discovery can be reopened at 
the damages stage . . . if plaintiffs prevail on liability . . . and are seeking damages on those specific contracts"" with 
nondefendant railroads, id. at 66:18-21, the request at issue sought only data from 2000-2008, not the post-2008 data requested 
in plaintiffs' pending motion, and the availability of damages under nondefendant contracts was not being disputed by the 
parties. The Court's statements at the March 26 hearing therefore did not constitute a holding on an issue not raised by the 
parties in relation to the dispute resolved. "

characterization of their efforts to date. See Defs.' Opp'n at 26-28; May 6 Hr'g Tr. at 74:16-84:7. In light of defendants' 
statements at the May 6, 2021 hearing that their productions of price authorities will be substantially complete by June 30, 2021 
at the latest, see May 6 Hr'g Tr. at 82:24-25, 83:3-21, 83:23-84:7, this dispute need not be resolved. "

Giorgio Foods, Inc.; and Franklin Organic Mushrooms, Inc. (f/k/a Franklin Farms, Inc.). While the motion was pending, claims 
against Franklin Organic Mushrooms, Inc. (f/k/a Franklin Farms, Inc.) were dismissed with prejudice. "
410,2," In dicta, the Third Circuit has compared these decisions, stating, ""[t]he Royal Printing decision parallels the exception to Illinois 
Brick that we recognized in In re Sugar Indus. Antitrust Litig., 579 F.2d 13 (3d Cir.1979)."" Merican, 713 F.2d 958, 967 n. 20 
(3d Cir. 1983). The Court in Merican noted one key difference between the Ninth Circuit's interpretation in Royal Printing and the 
Third Circuit's interpretation of the ownership or control exception: in the Third Circuit, for the exception to apply, the antitrust 
conspirator ""must dominate the subsidiary's prices in accordance with the general price fixing conspiracy."" Id. (citing Mid-West 
Paper Prods., 596 F.2d 573, 589 (3d Cir. 1979)). The Merican opinion noted no other disagreement between the circuits' 
interpretation of the exception. "
416,1," Those manufacturers and suppliers include Bridgestone Corporation, Bridgestone APM Company, Yamashita Rubber Co., 
YUSA Corporation, Tokai Rubber Industries, DTR Industries, Toyo Tire & Rubber Co., Toyo Tire North American OE Sales, and 
Toyo Automotive Parts (USA) and ""unnamed co-conspirators."""
416,2," Judge Marianne O. Battani of the Eastern District of Michigan oversaw the In re: Automotive Parts Antitrust Litigation MDL for 
about eight years. In June of 2020, she removed herself from the MDL for health reasons. Judge Sean F. Cox, of the same 
district, is now presiding over the MDL. "
417,3," Because each manufacturer settled with the class separately, there are several settlement agreements. The relevant language 
is identical in all the agreements, so our analysis applies to all Defendants."
417,4," Plaintiffs concede that they did not timely opt out of the settlement class, and they do not contend that Defendants provided 
them insufficient notice of the settlement agreement, or of their ability to opt out of the class. "
419,5," In resolving this appeal, we do not decide whether Plaintiffs are appropriately considered direct purchasers for purposes of 
antitrust standing. Just a year ago, after the district court denied Defendants' motion to dismiss the direct-purchaser lawsuit, we 
held, on review of a petition to appeal under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b), that the facts were not sufficiently ""fleshed out"" to decide 
whether Plaintiffs had antitrust standing under the ownership-or-control exception. In re: Auto parts Antitrust Litig, et al., Dkt. No. 
19-106, Doc. No. 13 at 2. No additional discovery has been conducted in the interim to alter that holding."
419,6," After Illinois Brick was decided, several states passed statutes rejecting the logic of the special standing rule in Illinois Brick. 
Those states that amended their antitrust laws to specifically allow indirect purchasers to bring suit are often called ""Repealer 
States""; the states that did not amend their laws after Illinois Brick are referred to as ""Indirect Purchaser States."" "

445,1, Plaintiffs' 2014 suit will be discussed infra Section B.1. 
446,2," James Wallen, an associate and alleged co-conspirator of Phadia and Quest, put together a company called Universal Allergy 
Labs, LLC, not to be confused with Plaintiffs' United Allergy Labs (the predecessor to UAS). The Office of the Inspector General 
Opinion referred to UAL and expressed serious concerns about businesses providing allergy tests being run by a single person 
with no healthcare experience. Plaintiffs argue that Wallen intentionally ""sandbagged"" the review process to get an unfavorable 
decision so that it could be used to falsely equate Wallen's company with Plaintiffs. "

451,6," Plaintiffs' misappropriation of trade secrets claim was not litigated in the 2014 suit, probably because Plaintiffs did not yet know 
of Quest's involvement or that Quest shared the customer list with Phadia. "
454,1," The Court has jurisdiction over the instant action. Plaintiff States assert claims under Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 
U.S.C. §§ 1, 2, and Sections 4 and 16 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 15c, 26. See also 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1337. Plaintiff 
States also assert various state-law claims arising out of the same nucleus of operative fact, over which this Court is empowered 
to exercise supplemental jurisdiction. See 28 U.S.C. § 1367(a). "
457,2," The Seven Networks court rejected Google's argument that witnesses constitute sources of evidence under this first factor, 
noting that the Volkswagen court emphasized and analyzed only documentary evidence under this factor. Seven Networks, 
2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 146375, 2018 WL 4026760, at *3 (citing Volkswagen, 545 F.3d at 316). "
458,3," The compulsory-process factor weighs heaviest against or for transfer when either the transferor or transferee has ""absolute 
subpoena power,"" meaning that ""all relevant and material non-party witnesses reside within the subpoena power of a particular 
court."" Volkswagen, 545 F.3d at 316. Because neither this district nor the Northern District of California has absolute subpoena 
power, the magnitude of this factor is diminished."
458,4," Google maintains that transfer would not shift the inconvenience to the Plaintiff States because the inconvenience of litigating 
this case in the Northern District of California is no greater than the inconvenience of doing so in the Eastern District of Texas for 
most of the Plaintiff States. However, as Google concedes, this district is a more convenient forum for the lead Plaintiff State— "
459,," Texas. Further, the Court notes that, by any measure, the majority of Plaintiff States are closer to the Eastern District of Texas 
than to the Northern District of California."
459,5," Plaintiff States have also identified thirty-four additional nonparty witnesses located closer to this district, although statements 
regarding those witnesses' willingness to appear in this district have not been produced. (Dkt. #46-1 ¶ 3). "
460,6," For example, in their initial requests for discovery, the plaintiffs in In re Google Digital Advertising Antitrust Litigation indicated 
that they seek ""100,000 pages of documents that Google reportedly produced to the Texas Attorney General."" No. 5:20-cv-
03556, Dkt. #37 at 2 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 16, 2020)."
460,7," The Court notes that the class-action lawsuits in the Northern District of California referenced by Google are themselves not all 
pending before the same judge. Most of the cases are pending before Judge Freeman and have been consolidated into two 
related actions. See generally In re Google Digit. Advert. Antitrust Litig., No. 5:20-cv-03556-BLF, (N.D. Cal.); In re Google Digit. 
Publisher Antitrust Litig., No. 5:20-cv-08984-BLF, (N.D. Cal.). However, Judge Freeman rejected the relation of one other suit on 
which Google relies, and it remains pending before Judge Gilliam. See In re Google Digit. Advert. Antitrust Litig., No. 5:20-cv- "

HSG (N.D. Cal.)). Accordingly, it is not obvious that, were the Court to transfer this case, it would be assigned to any particular judge presiding 
over cases involving similar allegations against Google. See TravelPass, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 142227, 2019 WL 3806056, at 
*16 (noting that the defendants could not meet their burden by simply assuming that the similar cases would be consolidated

power.'"" (citations omitted)). "
479,4," While the Ninth Circuit's decision in Omega Environmental dealt with a claim under Section 3 of the Clayton Act, the Ninth 
Circuit has applied similar standards in Sherman Act cases and held that ""a greater showing of anticompetitive effect is required 
to establish a Sherman Act violation than a section three Clayton Act violation in exclusive-dealing cases."" Twin City 
Sportservice, 676 F.2d at 1304 n.9 (emphasis added). "
480,5," The Court notes that the exclusionary zone challenged by PSG centers on Rancho Cucamonga, California and not Mesa, 
Arizona, the site of the planned CMC micro mill. While certainly revealing with respect to CMC's motives, this fact does not 
obviate the need for PSG to plausibly allege all necessary elements of its Sherman Act claims. Additionally, even if CMC had 
opted to center the second exclusionary zone on Mesa, Arizona, that still would have foreclosed PSG from building a micro mill 
in the greater Los Angeles basin. "
481,6," The Court also DENIES AS MOOT Defendants' motion to stay discovery pending the Court's decision on Defendants' motion to 
dismiss. Dkt. No. 49. "
484,1," The parties also argued that if the Court were to find venue improper, transfer to the District of New Jersey would also be 
proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1406(a). (Doc No. 19 at 2-3.)"
484,2," Unless otherwise noted, these facts are all drawn from Cigna's complaint. At this stage of the litigation, we take the well-
pleaded allegations in Cigna's complaint as true. See Lewis v. Nat'l Bd. of Osteopathic Med. Exam'rs, Civil Action No. 20-4368,

485,5," Section 1391(b) states: A civil action may be brought in (1) a judicial district in which any defendant resides, if all defendants are residents of the 
State in which the district is located; (2) a judicial district in which a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to 
the claim occurred, or a substantial part of property that is the subject of the action is situated; or (3) if there is no district in 
which an action may otherwise be brought as provided in this section, any judicial district in which any defendant is subject 
to the court's personal jurisdiction with respect to such action. "
486,6," As one judge put it in evaluating a proposed transfer from the District of New Jersey to the Eastern District, ""as the James A. 
Byrne Courthouse in Philadelphia is visible from the upper floors of the Mitchell H. Cohen Courthouse in Camden, the Court 
cannot conceive of any meaningful inconvenience or difficulty posed by continued litigation in New Jersey as opposed to the 
Eastern District of Pennsylvania."" United Ass'n of Plumbers & Pipefitters Loc. 322 of S. N.J. v. Mallinckrodt ARD, LLC, Civil No. 
20-188 (RBK/KMW), 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 148343, 2020 WL 5627149, at *8 (D.N.J. Aug. 18, 2020). As the related cases in the 
District of New Jersey are assigned to the Honorable Esther Salas (see Doc. No. 17 at ¶¶ 3-5), who is stationed in Newark, the 
situation in this case is not quite as dramatic as that in Mallinckrodt. Nonetheless, the spirit of the Mallinckrodt court's analysis 
applies equally here. "
487,7," In the twelve-month period ending on September 30, 2020, there were 440 pending cases and 306 weighted filings per judge in

487,8," The Third Circuit has explained that, for the purposes of 15 U.S.C. § 22, a corporation may be ""found"" in any judicial district in 
which it has a ""presence"" and ""continuous local activities."" In re Auto. Refinishing Paint Antitrust Litig., 358 F.3d 288, 293 n.6 (3d 
Cir. 2004) (quoting Caribe Trailer Sys., Inc. v. P.R. Mar. Shipping Auth., 475 F. Supp. 711, 716 (D.D.C. 1979)). Additionally, a 
corporation ""transacts business"" within a district for § 22 purposes if, ""in the ordinary and usual sense"" it engages ""in any 
substantial business operations"" there. United States v. Scophony Corp. of Am., 333 U.S. 795, 807, 68 S. Ct. 855, 92 L. Ed. 
1091 (1948). The Court finds that, for the purposes of 15 U.S.C. § 22, a company that rents a warehouse within a judicial district 
may be ""found"" in and ""transacts business"" in that district. See R.I. Fittings Co. "
488,9," See Worldwide Facilities, BRISTOL MYERS SQUIBB, https://www.bms.com/about-us/our-company/worldwide-facilities.html (last 
accessed May 5, 2021)."
488,10," In the alternative, even if venue were not proper in the Eastern District, the Court finds that it would be in the interest of justice 
to transfer Counts I and VI to the District of New Jersey, where venue is proper, and thus would approve the transfer pursuant to 
28 U.S.C. § 1406(a)."
488,11," During the status conference Defendants agreed for purposes of venue only that these state law claims arise out of the same 
operative facts."
488,12," The Court notes that Cigna's claim for unjust enrichment alleges that Defendants have been unjustly enriched under the state 
laws of both Pennsylvania and New Jersey, and as such, this remains a neutral factor in the Court's analysis, as both the 
transferor and transferee jurisdictions have an interest in resolving local controversies arising under their laws at home. And, 
although Cigna alleges a violation of Pennsylvania state law, but not New Jersey law, as to its claim for unfair and deceptive 
trade practices, the Court finds that the familiarity with the law public interest factor is also neutral here as ""[f]ederal district 
courts are regularly called upon to interpret the laws of jurisdictions outside of the states in which they sit."" Nathan, 2019 WL 
3216613, at *7. "
495,1," Parker immunity is also known as ""state-action"" immunity."
495,2," Parties do not appear to dispute that the City Council and CTS are municipal agents for the purposes of Parker immunity. 
Therefore, the Court will analyze the applicability of Parker immunity to the actions of Defendants altogether. "
506,1," The Court adopted the parties' proposed briefing schedule leading up to the hearing. ECF 23. In its Response to Plaintiff's TRO 
Motion, Defendant argued that the Norris LaGuardia Act's (""NLGA"") anti-injunction provision, 29 U.S.C. § 101, divested this 
Court of jurisdiction to issue an injunction in this case unless it conformed with the NLGA's enumerated special requirements. 
ECF 35 at 25-30. This Court ordered the parties to provide briefing addressing whether the NLGA's anti-injunction provision 
applied to this case. ECF 40. On May 19, 2021, this Court issued an Order finding that the NLGA's anti-injunction provision does 
not apply to this case. ECF 45. "
517,1," The parties are familiar with the factual and procedural history of this matter and therefore the Court recites only those facts 
necessary to resolve the instant motion. See AlphaCard Sys. LLC v. Fery LLC, No. 19-20110, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 147059, 
2020 WL 4736072 (D.N.J. Aug. 14, 2020)."
517,2," Referring to them collectively as the Barcodes Enterprise, Fery indicates that Plaintiffs and four other nonparty entities are 
subsidiaries of nonparty Barcodes, which in turn is controlled by nonparty Odyssey Investment Partners, LLC. (Countercls. ¶¶ 1-
9, 15.) "
519,3," Similarly, Fery's conclusory allegation regarding the diversion of customers from Amazon to Plaintiffs' own websites is also 
insufficient to state an antitrust injury. (Countercls. ¶ 24.) And although the Court only addresses antitrust injury, the Court notes 
that Fery fails to adequately explain or provide any support—even in its opposition brief—for its proposition that those actions 
constitute actionable anti-competitive conduct. (See Fery Opp'n Br. 12-20.) "
534,1," According to the Direct Action Plaintiffs' consolidated complaint, the following plaintiffs have sued Rabobank: Sysco 
Corporation; US Foods, Inc.; EMA Foods Co., LLC; L. Hart, Inc.; R&D Marketing, LLC; Timber Lake Foods, Inc.; Campbell Soup 
Company, and related entities; Target Corporation; McLane Company, Inc. and related entities; Kinexo, Inc.; John Soules 
Foods, Inc. and John Soules Acquisitions LLC; and Red Bird Farms Distribution Company. See R. 4243 at 3-52. The three 
classes and more than 100 other Direct Action Plaintiffs have not. "
535,2," By ""Rabobank,"" Plaintiffs mean: Utrecht-America Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation headquartered in New York, NY, 
which is the American subsidiary of the Dutch cooperative banks Cooperative Rabobank U.A. and Rabobank International 
Holding, B.V., and the subsidiaries Rabo AgriFinance LLC, a Delaware limited liability company headquartered in Saint Louis, 
MO; Rabobank USA Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation headquartered in New York, NY; and Utrecht-America 
Finance Co., a Delaware company headquartered in New York, NY. See R. 4243 at 121-22 (¶ 240). "
544,1," The SAC regularly refers to ""Synta,"" defined as ""a conglomerate of entities owned and controlled by Dar-Tson 'David' Shen and 
his close family members that include Synta Technology Corporation, Suzhou Synta, and a shadowy network of other factories 
and distributors."" SAC ¶ 2 n.1. Defendants challenge the use of ""Synta"" and, as discussed further below, argue that such 
allegations do not adequately distinguish among corporate affiliates. In summarizing the allegations of the SAC and without 
prejudging the arguments, the Court refers to Synta where no affiliate is specified. "
559,1, The parties have consented to the jurisdiction of a magistrate judge for all purposes pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(c).

561,4," Facebook, Inc. v. BrandTotal Ltd., No. 20-cv-07182-JCS, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 31558, 2021 WL 662168 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 19, 
2021). "
563,5," In briefing its motion for a preliminary injunction, BrandTotal argues that a likelihood of success on its declaratory judgment 
counterclaims could support injunctive relief, which would suggest that these counterclaims have practical value separate from 
Facebook's affirmative claims. The Court disagrees. A determination that UpVoice 2021 does not violate the particular laws at 
issue in these counterclaims would not in itself require Facebook to allow the use of UpVoice 2021 on its social networks. 
BrandTotal cites hiQ's reference to the plaintiff in that case having asserted declaratory judgment claims (including claims to 
declare that it did not violate the CFAA and section 502), see 938 F.3d at 992, but the Ninth Circuit's analysis focused on the 
plaintiff's interference with contract claim, id. at 995-99, and addressed the CFAA only in the context of the defendant's argument 
that it preempted the interference claim, id. at 999-1004, not to consider the merits of the plaintiff's claim for declaratory 
judgment. "
564,6," In a footnote of its brief opposing a preliminary injunction, Facebook implies that BrandTotal conceded that it is a ""Covered 
Third Party,"" relying on a statement by BrandTotal's counsel at the hearing on its motion for a TRO. See Pl.'s Opp'n (dkt. 134) at 
21 n.12. The full statement, in response to the Court's question of whether BrandTotal was a ""Covered Third Party,"" was as 
follows: ""I would think that we would be, Your Honor, yes. But I would want to study that specific question more, because it 
wasn't raised."" Oct. 20, 2020 Hr'g Tr. (dkt. 57) at 8:24-9:1. In light of counsel's specifically-stated intent to further investigate the 
issue, his statement was not a concession."
564,7," The FTC order is included in the record in a number of places, including as Exhibit C to BrandTotal's amended counterclaims. "

566,9," BrandTotal also relies heavily, and mistakenly, on a 2019 report by Facebook's researcher Sanchit Karve characterizing a 
separate BrandTotal mobile app, Social One—which BrandTotal contends functioned in a materially identical manner to UpVoice 
Legacy—as ""harmless."" FACC ¶¶ 59, 63, 155 & Ex. E. In context, Karve clearly distinguishes between the code included in the 
""app itself,"" which he concluded did not ""contain any spyware/code within it,"" and a script that he determined the app ""inject[ed],"" 
which he concluded appeared to suggest scraping of ""profile info and ads,"" necessitating further analysis ""to see what they're 
stealing exactly"" and perhaps ""legal action against these guys."" Id. Ex. E. Taken as a whole, the report cannot reasonably be 
interpreted as indicating that Karve believed Social One was ""harmless."" But regardless of the merits of the ""harmless"" 
characterization, BrandTotal has included sufficient allegations of bad faith with respect to Facebook's assertion that it lacked 
sufficient disclosures, as discussed above. "
567,10," The Court notes that although Facebook employees sent their first two emails to Google one day before the internal email 
discussing a customer who used BrandTotal, Google did not immediately respond, and Facebook employee Sanchit Karve 
followed up several days later ""to ask if [Google] had a chance to look into our request."" FACC Ex. I. BrandTotal is also correct 
that the September 22 email refers to Facebook having ""learned""—in the past tense—that the customer used BrandTotal, which 
leaves a possibility that Facebook obtained that knowledge before reporting UpVoice to Google. "
569,11," Since the parties have not briefed this issue of independent wrongfulness in detail, this order is without prejudice to arguments 
that either party might present on that issue at summary judgment. "
570,12," Loop AI Labs Inc v. Gatti, No. 15-cv-00798-HSG, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 117330, 2015 WL 5158639, at *5 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 2, 
2015). "
571,13," BrandTotal has not asserted interference with prospective economic advantage as to potential prospective panelists. See 
FACC ¶¶ 161-69. If it had, the Court would similarly dismiss that aspect of the claim for failure to allege existing relationships or 
Facebook's knowledge of such a relationships."
571,14," There may be other circumstances were wrongful conduct can support an ""unfair"" UCL claim, see, e.g., Doe v. CVS 
Pharmacy, Inc., 982 F.3d 1204, 1214-15 (9th Cir. 2020), cert. petition docketed, No. 20-1374 (U.S. Mar. 26, 2021), but those 
theories are limited to claims by consumers rather than competitors, see Morgan v. AT&T Wireless Servs., Inc., 177 Cal. App. 
4th 1235, 1254, 99 Cal. Rptr. 3d 768 (2009), and BrandTotal has not asserted them here, see Defs.' Opp'n at 19-21. "
573,15," BrandTotal's opposition brief further muddles its theory of a relevant market, asserting that, ""[t]hough BrandTotal contends that 
the Facebook network is not itself a market, given the dominance of Facebook in the social media sphere, as alleged in the 
Amended Counterclaims, [FACC] ¶ 182, Facebook's monopolization of data on the Facebook network is crippling to any 
company engaged in social media commercial advertising."" Defs.' Opp'n at 21. "

608,22," Although BHRS attempts to shift the focus away from the content of the reviews at issue, see Opposition 7:21-25, the 
Amended Complaint includes screenshots of three negative reviews of BHRS's products, which reviews BHRS alleges were 
connected to Brio, see Amended Complaint ¶¶ 49-51. Notably, though, BHRS does not allege that these reviews are fake. To 
the contrary, BHRS explicitly acknowledges that these reviewers purchased products from BHRS. Id. at ¶ 50; cf. id. at ¶¶ 36-39. 
And, as explained above, BHRS does not allege sufficient facts to support a plausible inference that these reviewers are part of 
Brio's alleged false advertising scheme."

Complaint, is not sufficient to plead a claim under the ""unfair"" prong of the UCL. See First Order 15:16-21. "
610,28," The Amended Complaint also alleges that Brio's conduct violates ""28 U.S.C. § 1125,"" id. at ¶ 89; however, BHRS likely meant 
to cite 15 U.S.C. § 1125 (i.e., the Lanham Act), because title 28 of the United States Code does not contain a § 1125 (title 28 
governs the judiciary and judicial procedure). Regardless, the Court already determined, in the preceding section, that the 
Amended Complaint fails adequately to allege a claim under the Lanham Act."

613,1," Plaintiffs abandoned their Section 2 predatory pricing claim. (Doc. No. 145 at 2, 32). "
617,2," The Clayton Act provides the vehicle to sue for redress under Section 2. Section 16 of the Clayton Act provides in part that

622,2," ""[F]ixed effects allows the econometrician to identify statistical relationships after accounting for the...effects unique to

623,," the dependent variable and other independent variables."" ABA Section of Antitrust Law, Econometrics: Legal, Practical, and 
Technical Issues § 5.B.1.a (2d ed. 2014). "
625,3," In light of the Court's opinion that Bi-Lo is ineligible for overcharge damages, Dr. Leffler ""re-estimated the regression analysis 
using only Winn-Dixie data[,]"" and excluding Bi-Lo purchases. (Leffler Decl. ¶ 5.) The result was an increase to Winn-Dixie's 
overcharges that, according to Dr. Leffler, was not statistically significant and did not meaningfully change Dr. Leffler's opinions. 
(Id.)"
625,4," ""Fixed-effects models often use dummy variables to measure the effect of interest, where a dummy variable is a variable that 
takes the value of 1 for observations in the subgroup, time period, or event of interest, and 0 for all other observations."" ABA 
Section of Antitrust Law, supra, § 5.B.1.a. "
629,5," Dr. Leffler states that his model uses only seven variables, since when a contemporaneous and lagged value of the same 
variable are included, the sum of those coefficients are the expected sign for that variable. (Leffler Rebut. Rpt. ¶ 29 n.50.) "
630,6," Separately, Defendants also argue Dr. Leffler's model is unreliable because of his ""failure to account for the substantially 
declining market share due to resignation of EMMC members...."" (Defs.' Mot. at 10.) Specifically, Dr. David argues that because "
631,," there were significant resignations from the EMMC beginning in 2002, ""there is no evidence of market power beginning at least 
as early as 2006."" (David Rpt. ¶ 67; see id. ¶¶ 66, 68.) Defendants also argue that Dr. Leffler's third conspiracy period should be 
excluded because it reflects Winn-Dixie's purchases after OMF and Monterey had resigned from the EMMC. (See id. ¶¶ 58-62.) 
Both of these additional arguments only implicate Dr. Leffler's assessment of damages after 2005. In light of the Court's decision 
in Section III.A.2 infra to exclude damages premised on anticompetitive conduct after August 2005, the Court need not address 
these additional arguments concerning reliability. "

""exact match,"" or, as mentioned, ""negative match."" An ad tied to a keyword designated as ""broad match"" may appear when a 
consumer's search on Google contains the specific keyword, any plural forms or synonyms of the keyword, or phrases similar to 
the keyword. An advertiser selecting ""phrase match"" will have its ad appear when a search contains additional words along with "
645,," the keyword. An ""exact match"" limits the ad's appearance to when the consumer searches the exact keyword. ""Negative 
keywords"" can also be designated by an advertiser for broad, phrase, or exact match. The Challenged Agreements do not 
specify whether the negative keywords must be employed using broad, phrase, or exact match."
645,3," Section 5 of the FTC Act states that ""[u]nfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce, and unfair or deceptive acts or 
practices in or affecting commerce, are hereby declared unlawful."" 15 U.S.C. § 45(a)(1). "
646,4," All four participating Commissioners agreed that Actavis does not immunize trademark settlement agreements from antitrust 
scrutiny. Commissioner Wilson did not participate in the appeal to the Commission. "
648,5," The ""quick-look"" and ""inherently suspect"" approaches are similar, and Petitioner does not take issue with the interchangeability 
of the two formulations of this abbreviated analysis. "
649,6," In California Dental, as an initial matter, the court rejected the use of an abbreviated rule of reason analysis for restraints on 
price and quality advertising. 526 U.S. at 781. And in Polygram, the fact that the challenged conduct also restricted the parties 
from offering discounts on concert albums was key to the D.C. Circuit's affirmation of the inherently suspect analysis; the court 
thought that the agreement looked ""suspiciously like a naked price fixing agreement between competitors[.]"" See Polygram, 416 
F.3d at 37."
649,7," We do not discount the economic evidence cited by the Commission in coming to its conclusion, but the fact that it required the 
testimony of expert witnesses who provided empirical analyses in order to determine the net competitive effect of the Challenged 
Agreements underscores the point: these restraints are not obviously anticompetitive to someone with only a rudimentary 
understanding of economics. See MLB, 542 F.3d at 340, n.10 (Sotomayor, J., concurring)."
649,8," We also reject the Commission and amici's arguments that the restrictions constitute illegal bid rigging as support for their use 
of the inherently suspect framework. HN12[
] An absolute ban on competitive bidding, or bid rigging, would be anticompetitive on its face and may justify an abbreviated rule of reason analysis. Cal. Dental, 570 U.S. at 770 (citing National Soc. of 
Professional Engineers v. United States, 435 U.S. 679, 692-93, 98 S. Ct. 1355, 55 L. Ed. 2d 637 (1978)); see also United States 
v. Joyce, 895 F.3d 673, 679 (9th Cir. 2018) (finding bid rigging to be per se illegal). It is not clear to us, however, that the 
restrictions constitute such a ban. The Challenged Agreements do not prevent the parties from participating in keyword auctions, 
only from bidding on trademarked terms. Whether restrictions on advertisers' use of particular terms leads to overall harm to the 
search engines is not obvious and therefore does not justify analyzing the agreements under the inherently suspect framework. 
Nor, as amici in support of the government argue, is it obvious that the restrictions constitute market division, another type of 
restraint that would justify an abbreviated analysis. See Palmer v. BRG of Georgia, Inc., 498 U.S. 46, 111 S. Ct. 401, 112 L. Ed. 
2d 349 (1990) (per curiam). "
650,9," Though the government argued to the ALJ that the parties to the Challenged Agreements collectively have market power in the 
relevant market and that the nature of the restraints makes it likely that the Challenged Agreements will have an anticompetitive 
effect, the ALJ chose not to determine the prima facie case under that theory, nor did the Commission on appeal."
650,10," The government argues, inter alia, that (a) Petitioner admits that it charges more than their competitors in the relevant market; 
(b) economic theory strongly suggests that advertising restrictions tend to increase prices of any given product; and (c) Petitioner 
offered to meet or beat any price offered by other online retailers. Even accepting all this as true, it is not direct evidence that the 
Challenged Agreements caused the price of contact lenses in the relevant market to rise, as our precedent requires. 
MacDermid, 833 F.3d at 184."
650,11," A slightly different issue plagues the government's argument that there is direct evidence of reduced revenues for search 
engines. To show this, the government did not show that Google or Microsoft, the companies who control the two most popular 
search engines, had lower revenues after the Challenged Agreements were put into place. Nor did the government introduce 
evidence that Petitioner spent less money on search advertising than it did before the Challenged Agreements came into effect. 
Instead, the government offered empirical evidence that the Challenged Agreements reduced the price paid by Petitioner for 
each click on one of its keywords. JA 1096-99. HN15[
] Empirical evidence is, as noted, required under our caselaw to find direct evidence of an anticompetitive effect. K.M.B., 61 F.3d at 127. But showing that a price for certain keywords dropped is not 
direct evidence of the effect on the market as a whole. See Clorox, 117 F.3d at 56 (quoting K.M.B., 61 F.3d at 127). This 
snapshot shows only that Petitioner paid less for certain keyword advertisements, no more and no less. While it is true that, when evaluating ""whether horizontal restraints had an adverse effect on competition,"" we do not always 
""need to precisely define the relevant market to conclude that these agreements were anticompetitive,"" Am. Express, 138 S.Ct. 
at 2285 n.7, more was needed under our precedent if the Commission wished to show ""direct"" evidence in the market as a 
whole. See Clorox, 117 F.3d at 56. The ""product"" offered by search engines of which the Challenged Agreements allegedly 
restrain trade is, presumably, advertisers' use of keywords, but that is not clear from the record. For the same reason, we also "
651,," cannot say that the Commission's conclusion that the Challenged Agreements harmed search engines by reducing quality in the 
market was supported by substantial evidence."
651,12," Though the Luxottica agreement was not the result of a trademark dispute, the agreement contains trademark protections 
similar to those in the other Challenged Agreements. And while the restrictions in the Luxottica Agreement may best be 
considered under the doctrine of ancillary restraints, see MLB, 542 F.3d at 334 (Sotomayor, J., concurring), the government 
does not attempt here to offer direct evidence differentiating the reductions in advertising stemming solely from that agreement. "
652,," In any event, because we hold that protecting trademarks is a valid procompetitive justification for the restrictions, we see no 
further need to differentiate the Luxottica Agreement from the other agreements."
652,13," At the time the agreements were entered into, the law regarding the validity of Petitioner's trademark claims was unsettled, 
and it remains so in this Circuit. The fact that the law was unsettled at the time is one reason a party might enter into a 
settlement agreement."
652,14," It has not been argued that exceptional circumstances exist in this case. We, therefore, need not decide what circumstances 
might qualify as exceptional, von Hofe v. United States, 492 F.3d 175, 185 n.3 (2d Cir. 2007), such as, for example, agreements 
between parties with unequal bargaining power. See Clorox, 117 F.3d at 60 (""There is no evidence that [a party to the 
challenged agreement] entered the agreement under duress."")."
652,15," Intent plays a role in this conclusion. See Clorox, 117 F.3d at 60 (citing Chicago Bd. of Trade, 246 U.S. at 238). There is 
ample evidence that, if Petitioner's competitors had not been precluded by the Challenged Agreements from running ads on 
Petitioner's trademarks, they would have done so; the competitors' use of the terms is what spawned the agreements in the first 
place. This is unlike a typical market division case, where the two parties agree not to compete in the same geographic areas 
because it would benefit both of their bottom lines. Cf. Palmer, 498 U.S. at 49-50 (holding an agreement between bar review 
course providers dividing market territories for the purpose of raising prices was per se illegal)."
652,16," The government argues that if we find that the Commission improperly weighed the procompetitive justification of Petitioner's 
trademark protections, we should remand to allow the Commission to reconsider in the first instance. The Commission, however, 
already determined that, assuming the procompetitive justifications were legitimate, they were not reasonably necessary to 
achieve the proffered procompetitive benefits. We need not remand to allow them to rearticulate the same point. "
653,17," We acknowledge a concern that the Challenged Agreements require the parties to employ negative keywords, which prevent 
ads of competitors from appearing in a consumer search for each other's trademarked terms — even absent purchase of a 
keyword (but rather due to a search engine's independent determination that an ad is relevant to the consumer). Even if we were 
inclined to consider whether this aspect of the settlement agreement goes beyond any legitimate claim of trademark 
infringement, and therefore imposes a restraint on competition not justified by the procompetitive value of enforcing trademark 
rights, the Commission has neither made separate findings with respect to the specific anticompetitive effects of this narrow 
aspect of the settlement agreements, nor urged that we should evaluate this issue separately. Accordingly, we have no reason 
to consider that issue. "
655,1," Sanofi P.R., which is not a party to the litigation, has appeared solely for the purpose of opposing FWK's motion for leave to 
amend. "
657,2," While this court expresses no opinion on whether FWK will be able to support its claim that Sanofi U.S. and Sanofi P.R. are 
part of a single economic enterprise, FWK has submitted evidence indicating that Sanofi P.R. could potentially face liability 
under such a theory. Under these circumstances, denying the motion for leave to amend and forcing FWK to replead its claim 
against Sanofi P.R. would be inefficient and effectively elevate form over substance. "
660,3," The January 21, 2021 deadline for amending the pleadings contains an exception for ""any proposed amendments or additions 
based on information discovered through the review of the post-May 2016 discovery materials[.]"" (Docket No. 214 at 1 n.1). That 
exception is not relevant to the plaintiff's present motion for leave to file a TAC. "
676,1," In a patent litigation, ""the construction of a patent, including terms of art within its claim, is exclusively within the province of the 
court."" Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., 517 U.S. 370, 372, 116 S. Ct. 1384, 134 L. Ed. 2d 577 (1996). "
678,2," SBA brings state, rather than federal, claims because ""Under the United States Supreme Court's decision in Illinois Brick Co. v. 
Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 745-46, 97 S. Ct. 2061, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1977), indirect purchasers of products sold at supra-competitive 
prices lack standing to sue under federal antitrust statutes"" but ""may still bring suit under state antitrust laws, if a state permits 
such claims."" Namenda VI, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 220574, 2018 WL 7197233, at *1 "
680,3," I use the word ""assessment"" advisedly. Dr. Davitz did not purport to ""calculate"" anything, but sought to quantify, to the extent 
he could do so, his conclusion that Mylan was ""substantially likely"" to prevail in the '703 patent lawsuit. "
688,4," See How is Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosed, National Institute on Aging, https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/how-alzheimers-
disease-diagnosed (last visited June 10, 2021) (""It's important to note that Alzheimer's disease can be definitively diagnosed 
only after death, by linking clinical measures with an examination of brain tissue in an autopsy.""). "
691,5," Of course, since the witnesses never actually testified, we cannot know whether a seeming internal contradiction was not a 
contradiction at all, or whether it could be explained in a way that would appeal to the common sense of the trier of fact."
691,6," That is because Chief Judges get statistics about their colleagues' work, not because Chief Judges have any power to control 
their colleagues' dockets, to assign them work, to supervise their work, or to require that they complete their work in a timely 
manner—all points that I, as a former Chief Judge, would insist be made if the jury were to become aware that Ms. Robinson 
had been Chief Judge. The title ""Chief United States District Judge,"" as I learned during my term, is highly misleading to the 
uninitiated — especially since Chief Judges in the several states tend to have a great deal of power over the conduct of business 
in their respective courts. Chief United States District Judges do not. "
692,7," It is my understanding that the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reverses district court claim construction decisions about 
50% of the time. It could of course be that reversal is less likely for Delaware judges; that datum is not in the record. But the 
nationwide reversal rate is quite well known among district court judges. And a 50% reversal rate makes it a coin toss whether 
such interesting constructions as the one adopted by Judges Stark and Sleet about ""cerebral ischemia"" (a common medical term 
for the interruption of blood flow to the brain, a/k/a stroke) would have withstood an appeal."
692,8," There is also a fifth count for declaratory relief, seeking the Court to declare that ""Defendants' conduct seeking to prevent 
competition"" constituted illegal monopolization. (ECF 326 at ¶ 246). Its fate hinges on the fate of the other claims and it is 
probably not a form of relief the Court will be inclined to award. "
694,9," The other agreement was with the generic manufacturer, Orchid. Orchid was the last generic manufacturer to settle before 
Mylan. Although Forest/Merz sued Orchid along with the other generics in the District of Delaware, the case was transferred to 
the District of New Jersey. Orchid settled on March 23, 2010, four months before Mylan settled on July 21, 2010. (ECF 570 at ¶ 
27). The record does not indicate if there was any other possible consideration associated with the Orchid agreement."
694,10," If the jury decides that there were two separate settlements — which would mean that the Paragraph IV lawsuit was settled for 
$2 million, not upwards of $32 million — the Court may well direct a verdict on the issue of ""large and unjustified,"" although we 
will hash this out fully at trial. "
698,11," As the owner of the '703 Patent, Merz was a necessary party to any lawsuit that alleged the infringement of that patent. 
""Traditionally, when the interest transferred is deemed a license"" — as was the case with Merz's licensing of the '703 Patent to 
Forest — ""the patent-holder is a necessary party because the patent-holder is still the real party in interest with respect to the 
validity of the patent."" Refac Int'l, Ltd. v. Mastercard Int'l, 758 F. Supp. 152, 157 (S.D.N.Y. 1991) (citation omitted.); see also 
IpVenture, Inc. v. Prostar Computer, Inc., 503 F. 3d 1324, 1325 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Merz's contract with Forest also required Merz 
to be involved in any litigation defending its intellectual property. It included a provision stating that Merz ""shall be solely 
responsible for taking all actions, in the courts, administrative agencies, or otherwise, to prevent or enjoin any and all such 
infringements and other unauthorized uses of Merz' Intellectual Property Rights"" and that Forest was to ""take no action with 
respect to any such infringement or unauthorized use of Merz' Intellectual Property Rights, without the prior written authorization 
of Merz."" (ECF 607, Exh. 24 at 20). "
699,12," Exactly how much money is not clear. SBA's damages expert, William Vogt, calculated total overcharges to the IPPs as 
between $1.98 and $2.21 billion, depending on the date of generic entry in the but-for world. (ECF 447, Exh. 2 at tbl. 6). 
Assuming that to be a rough approximation of the revenues Forest expected to earn (which appears reasonable in light of 
Namenda's $1.5 billion in sales in 2013, see Namenda II, 787 F.3d at 647), then Merz's entitlement to 20% of Forest's revenue 
could have netted it between an additional $396 million and $424 million due to the delayed generic entry."
699,13," Again, I am effectively ""reserving"" on that issue at present."
699,14," The Second Amended Complaint originally included claims arising under the laws of fourteen states, not thirteen. The extra 
state was Missouri, but SBA did not move for class certification in connection with any actions taken in or any harmed incurred in 
Missouri. See Namenda VIII, 338 F.R.D. 527, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26566, 2021 WL 509988 at *5. SBA also does not mention 
any Missouri claims in the summary judgment motions. Accordingly, the Court finds that the IPPs have abandoned any Missouri 
claims. "
705,15," Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, 
Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, South 
Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. IPPs also originally included claims arising under the unjust-
enrichment laws of Missouri, Wyoming, and Puerto Rico, but the IPPs did not move for class certification based on any actions 
undertaken or any harmed incurred in those four territories. See Namenda VIII, 338 F.R.D. 527, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26566, 
2021 WL 509988 at *5. Accordingly, the Court assumes that those claims are dropped. "
707,16," This is a nationwide number, not just a Utah number; in fact, I do not know whether it included any consumers in Utah. 
However, the certified class undoubtedly includes plaintiffs who reimbursed Utah consumers for Namenda. "
708,17," Hawaii, Maine, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, West Virginia, 
Wisconsin, and Washington D.C. (ECF 565 at 39)."
708,18," Idaho, Illinois, and Nebraska. (ECF 565 at 39). "
709,19," Forest also raised a statute-of-limitations argument about consumer-protection claims under Alabama law, but since that claim 
has been dismissed, the statute-of-limitations argument is now moot. "
713,1," In the Eleventh Circuit, ""a stay, not a dismissal, is the proper procedural mechanism for a district court to employ when 
deferring to a parallel state-court proceeding under the Colorado River doctrine."" Moorer v. Demopolis Waterworks & Sewer Bd., 
374 F.3d 994, 998 (11th Cir. 2004) (internal quotations and citations omitted)."
713,2," ""Unpublished opinions are not controlling authority and are persuasive only insofar as their legal analysis warrants."" Bonilla v. 
Baker Concrete Const., Inc., 487 F.3d 1340, 1345 (11th Cir. 2007). "
714,3," Because the Court finds that the proceedings do not involve ""substantially the same issues,"" there is no need to consider 
whether the proceedings involve ""substantially the same parties."" However, the Court notes that Defendant Matrix sues two 
individuals in the State Court Action that are not parties in this case, and, in this case, Plaintiffs sue six entities (i.e., Defendants 
Providence and the Frazier Entities) that are not parties in the State Court Action. (See Docs. 1, 50-2). Although Colorado River 
does not require an exact match, these dissimilarities are likely so substantial as to tip the balance in favor of the Court's 
exercise of jurisdiction. See Acosta, 478 F. App'x at 622. "
715,4," The Eleventh Circuit has adopted as binding precedent the decisions of the former Fifth Circuit issued before October 1, 1981. 
Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206 (11th Cir. 1981) (en banc)."
715,5," Defendants contend that the fifth factor is neutral because this case does not involve ""complex questions of state law that a 
state court might be best suited to resolve."" (Doc. 43, p. 10) (internal quotations omitted). However, Defendants misconstrue this 
factor; the inquiry is whether state or federal law is at issue. The absence of complex state law issues is irrelevant—the 
presence of a federal claim that can only be adjudicated in federal court is what matters here."
715,6," Defendants assert that the resolution of the State Court Action will be determinative of this case, but that result is far from 
inevitable given the difference in the issues. Regardless, in Aquatherm, the Eleventh Circuit found that the Florida court 
judgment as to the parties' state antitrust claims did not have preclusive effect in a federal action brought under the federal 
antitrust laws due to lack of subject matter jurisdiction. See id. Accordingly, the third factor weighs against abstention."
715,7," The Motion states that the state court resolved a motion to dismiss, but the cited paragraphs of Ernest Leonard's Declaration in 
Support of Defendants' Motion to Stay does not mention a motion to dismiss. (Doc. 43, p. 9; Doc. 43-1, pp. 3, 5, ¶¶ 4, 10-11). 
However, the resolution of a motion to dismiss by the state court does not change the Court's conclusion. "
716,8," Defendants also argue that Plaintiffs' ""conflicting allegations"" shows that this case is ""an illegitimate pressure tactic."" (Doc. 43, 
p. 10). Plaintiffs counter that ""Defendants do not explain how, even if there were an inconsistency between the state court 
counterclaim and the Clayton Act claim here, that inconsistency would render this action 'vexatious.' . . . Plaintiffs first asserted 
their state court counterclaim in 2019, before it was known whether Defendants' wrongful halt of Plaintiffs' mobile business was 
permanent. By late 2020, when Plaintiffs filed this action, it was clear that Defendants' actions were permanent."" (Doc. 50, p. 20) 
(emphasis in original). The Court agrees that the discrepancy in the pleadings is not inherently vexatious, reiterates that the 
distinction merely seems reflective of the different legal issues presented in the two actions, and notes that Defendants do not 
provide an explanation for how the inconsistency is vexatious. Moreover, the Court finds Plaintiffs' explanation conceivable, and 
it again notes that they may have a legitimate Clayton Act claim. The Court dismissed the Complaint without prejudice, and 
therefore the legitimacy of Plaintiffs' claim is unknown at this stage of the litigation."
716,9," The parties agree that neither court has assumed jurisdiction over property and that the federal forum and the state forum are 
equally convenient. (Doc. 43, p. 10; Doc. 50, pp. 13-14). Thus, the first and second factors are neutral."
716,10," Defendants also request a stay under the Court's inherent staying authority. (Doc. 43). District courts have broad discretion to 
stay proceedings. Clinton v. Jones, 520 U.S. 681, 706, 117 S. Ct. 1636, 137 L. Ed. 2d 945 (1997). The party seeking a stay has 
the burden to show good cause for and reasonableness of the requested stay. Belloso v. Asplundh Tree Expert Co., No. 6:18-
cv-460, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157936, 2018 WL 4407088, at *2 (M.D. Fla. Sept. 17, 2018). For the reasons stated above, the 
Court finds that a stay under its inherent staying authority is unreasonable and unsupported by good cause. "
719,1," Alternatively, in the event they are determined not to be direct purchasers, the plaintiffs explain that they bring this action on 
behalf of ""all persons and entities who indirectly purchased Inclusive Access Materials from the Defendants or co-conspirators 
for personal use."" "
720,2," The SAC notes that digital textbooks, whether offered through Inclusive Access or otherwise, are sometimes accompanied by 
Ancillary Required Course Materials."
720,3," The plaintiffs vacillate between using the term Inclusive Access to refer to digital textbooks and course materials sold by the 
Publisher Defendants to the Institutions and using it to describe the process and contractual arrangements for the delivery of 
these materials. The Defendants contend that the plaintiffs ""mischaracterize[] . . . Inclusive Access as if it were the educational 
materials themselves, rather than one of several mechanisms for the distribution and sale of those materials."" "
721,4," The SAC does not highlight the enactment of Rule 164 in its description of the adoption of Inclusive Access, but it does mention 
that the Rule ""govern[s] automatic billing for textbooks."" The SAC also asserts that the Defendants have violated Rule 164 
because textbooks distributed through Inclusive Access are not offered at a lower-than-competitive market rate and students are 
provided only an ""illusory"" opt-out. "
722,5," A B&N Agreement between Barnes & Noble and Eastern Kentucky University, dated June 30, 2017, was described in the SAC. 
The Defendants provided that agreement as an exhibit to their motion to dismiss."
722,6," The agreement is between Pearson and the University of Florida Board of Trustees, dated May 1, 2017."
722,7," The Pearson Agreement provides that the Institution must achieve thousands of enrollments in the first year and multiples of 
that number in the second year. An enrollment is defined as ""one student registered in one Course."""
722,8," The SAC does not separately define digital textbooks and eBooks. This Opinion therefore only uses the term digital textbooks 
except when quoting from the SAC or the agreements upon which it relies. "
723,9," The Cengage Agreement, dated March 21, 2017, is between Cengage and Central Washington University."
723,10," The McGraw Hill Agreement, dated March 27, 2019, is between McGraw Hill and Aztec Shops, Ltd., ""an Auxiliary"" of San 
Diego State University."
723,11," None of the Bookstore Operating Agreements or Institution Agreements use the term ""Inclusive Access."" The McGraw Hill 
Agreement, for example, refers to a ""web-based solution"" that enables students to subscribe to ""MHE Content,"" consisting of 
""certain online products and services . . . offered by MHE through [its] website . . . ."" The Pearson Agreement refers to ""Pearson 
Products,"" including ""eBooks,"" ""Revel,"" ""MyLabs,"" and ""Mastering."" The Cengage Agreement describes ""Titles"" that comprise 
""eBooks and digital homework solutions."" The B&N Agreement covers, among other things, digital textbooks and ""course 
materials and supplies, including . . . materials published or distributed electronically and/or through learning management 
systems, or sold over the Internet."""
723,12," An additional student purchaser class action that is before this Court, Cabral v. Cengage Learning, Inc., et al., 20cv3660, is 
related to this multi-district litigation. "
725,13," The plaintiffs in this case seek both damages and injunctive relief. The Supreme Court stated in Apple Inc. v. Pepper: Illinois Brick held that the direct-purchaser requirement applies to claims for damages. Illinois Brick did not address 
injunctive relief, and we likewise do not address injunctive relief in this case."
725,139," S. Ct. 1514, 1520 n.1, 203 L. Ed. 2d 802 (2019); see also id. at 1527 & n.1 (Gorsuch, J., dissenting) (arguing that under 
""traditional proximate cause principles,"" Illinois Brick should be read to bar suits by indirect purchasers for injunctive relief)."
725,14," Counts 1 and 2 are for injunctive relief; counts 4 and 5 are for damages. Each of these counts also alleges a conspiracy-to-
monopolize claim in violation of § 2. That claim is addressed as part of the § 2 discussion below. "
727,15," The plaintiffs briefly contend that the Publisher Defendants also coerced students into purchasing Inclusive Access materials 
and that this coercion constitutes another plus factor. It is the Institution, presumably in consultation with faculty, that decides 
whether to purchase Inclusive Access for any particular course. The extent to which students are deprived of a voice in that 
decision is irrelevant to the question of whether the SAC contains a plausible claim that the Publisher Defendants colluded with 
each other. Moreover, the plaintiffs misread the precedent on which they rely, Ambook Enterprises v. Time Inc., 612 F.2d 604, 616 (2d Cir. 
1979), in arguing that consumer coercion is a plus factor for purposes of § 1. The ""coercion"" that the Ambook court identified as 
a possible plus factor was ""[c]oerced parallelism,"" i.e., coerced participation in a conspiracy, rather than consumer coercion. Id. 
& n.19. "
732,1, The SAC does not separately define digital and e-textbooks. This Opinion therefore only uses the term digital textbooks. 
733,2," The SAC notes that digital textbooks, whether offered through Inclusive Access or otherwise, are sometimes accompanied by 
other educational materials, such as digital homework, quizzes, and exams. "
734,3," The SAC does not highlight the enactment of Rule 164 in its description of the adoption of Inclusive Access, but it does assert 
that the Publisher Defendants coordinated their efforts related to the DOE rulemaking that resulted in the Rule's promulgation. 
The SAC also asserts that the Defendants have violated Rule 164 because textbooks distributed through Inclusive Access are 
not offered at a lower-than-competitive market rate and students are not allowed to opt out."
734,4," Two B&N Agreements that were excerpted in the SAC were provided as exhibits to the Defendants' motion to dismiss. This 
Opinion refers only to the agreement between Barnes & Noble and Eastern Kentucky University, dated June 30, 2017. The other 
exemplar B&N Agreement, which is with Northwest Arkansas Community College, dates from 2012. "
735,5," The Follett Agreement that was excerpted in the SAC was provided as an exhibit to the Defendants' motion to dismiss. The 
Agreement is between Follett and the Tennessee Board of Regents and is dated April 2, 2018."
735,6," The amendment to the Follett Agreement is dated September 6, 2018."

740,9," The SAC asserts that the Publisher Defendants announced that they ""would be"" restricting and eventually discontinuing their 
production of hardcopy textbooks, but stops short of alleging that hardcopy textbooks are not available. "
742,10," It is unnecessary to decide here whether the consumers, for purposes of a relevant market analysis, should be defined as the 
Institution and its faculty or the students. "
746,11," The Defendants also move to dismiss the plaintiffs' Robinson-Patman Act claims on the ground that digital textbooks are not 
""commodities"" within the meaning of the Act. They describe Inclusive Access as a method of delivering content. This Opinion 
assumes without deciding that discriminatory pricing of Inclusive Access is subject to redress under the Robinson-Patman Act."
746,12," The Arkansas, New Mexico, and Texas unjust enrichment claims are brought against both the Publisher and Retailer 
Defendants. The Kentucky and Tennessee unjust enrichment claims are directed toward the Publisher Defendants alone. "
747,13," The Publisher Defendants, as members of EPEG, have standing to move to dismiss the claims against EPEG. The plaintiffs' 
argument to the contrary is rejected."
747,14," Counts 1, 3, and 9 plead that EPEG violated § 1 of the Sherman Act."
747,15," Where a legal standard is supplied by state law, Delaware law will be applied since this lawsuit was filed in Delaware. ""An 
MDL transferee court 'applies the substantive state law, including choice-of-law rules, of the jurisdiction in which the action was 
filed.'"" In re Mirena IUD Prods. Liab. Litig., 29 F. Supp. 3d 345, 350 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (quoting Menowitz v. Brown, 991 F.2d 36, 
40 (2d Cir. 1993)). In any event, the parties' briefs assume that Delaware rather than New York law controls. This ""implied 
consent . . . is sufficient to establish choice of law."" Santalucia v. Sebright Transp., Inc., 232 F.3d 293, 296 (2d Cir. 2000) 
(citation omitted)."
747,16," The Advisory Committee Notes to Rule 17(b) identify Charles E. Clark, A New Federal Civil Procedure - II. Pleadings and 
Parties, 44 Yale L.J 1291 (1935) and United Mine Workers of Am. v. Coronado Coal Co., 259 U.S. 344, 42 S. Ct. 570, 66 L. Ed. 
975 (1922), among other authorities, as influences on the Rule's development. Advisory Committee Notes of 1937, Rule 17,

the state court of the forum had earlier refused to recognize the association as such."" Clark, A New Federal Civil Procedure, 44 
Yale L.J. at 1316. Professor Clark notes with approval that the rule of United Mine Workers is ""desirable"" when a ""federal right 
would otherwise be impaired."" Id. "
748,17," The Defendants' motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(2) for lack of personal jurisdiction is denied. The SAC has pleaded 
sufficient facts to make a prima facie showing of jurisdiction. See SPV Osus Ltd. v. UBS AG, 882 F.3d 333, 342 (2d Cir. 2018). 
The plaintiffs' assertion that the Rule 12(b)(2) motion is untimely is rejected. "
754,1," The Court adopted the parties' proposed briefing schedule leading up to the TRO hearing. ECF 23. In its Response to Plaintiff's 
TRO Motion, Defendant argued that the Norris LaGuardia Act's (""NLGA"") anti-injunction provision, 29 U.S.C. § 101, divested this 
Court of jurisdiction to issue an injunction in this case unless it conformed with the NLGA's enumerated special requirements. 
ECF 35 at 25-30. This Court ordered the parties to provide briefing addressing whether the NLGA's anti-injunction provision 
applied to this case. ECF 40. On May 19, 2021, this Court issued an order finding that the NLGA's anti-injunction provision does 
not apply to this case. ECF 45."
754,2," In her supplemental memorandum in support of the preliminary injunction motion, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant has violated 
the spirit of the Court's TRO by adopting new ""age-related barriers"" to delay Plaintiff's entry into the League. ECF 50 at 12-17. 
Plaintiff therefore requests that this Court enter a preliminary injunction that not only enjoins Defendant from enforcing the Age 
Rule but also (1) prohibits Defendant ""from implementing any new measure, policy, or rule that has the effect of delaying or 
impeding the processing and approval of the Thorns' discovery request for [Plaintiff]; (2) prohibits [Defendant] from revoking or 
interfering with [Plaintiff's] status as a contracted player unless and until the League enters into a final CBA that includes an Age 
Rule which [Plaintiff] does not meet, and (3) expressly retains jurisdiction to monitor [Defendant's] compliance with the 
preliminary injunction and to award appropriate relief for any noncompliance."" Id. at 17. Defendant denies that it has violated the 
spirit of the TRO and insists that it ""is making all reasonable efforts to accommodate [Plaintiff's] desire to join a team as 
expeditiously as possible."" ECF 62 at 29. This afternoon, Plaintiff filed supplemental briefing and a declaration from counsel 
alleging further misconduct by Defendant and seeking intervention from this Court. ECF 85; ECF 86. Defendant has not yet had 
an opportunity to respond. Whether Defendant has violated the spirit of the TRO is an issue distinct from whether this Court 
should grant Plaintiff's request for a preliminary injunction. Accordingly, the Court considers only whether Plaintiff has met her 
burden of establishing that the preliminary injunction she sought in her complaint and the initial motion, ECF 2, is warranted at 
this time. Once Defendant has been afforded the opportunity to respond to Plaintiff's latest allegations, this Court will decide 
whether further action is required to ensure Defendant's compliance with its orders. "
755,3," In granting the preliminary injunction motion, this Court is not making a final ruling on the merits of this case. The preliminary 
injunction will remain in place until there is a trial on the merits, which this Court is willing to oversee on an expedited schedule. "
758,4," Defendant also argues that Jack Russell Terrier is ""instructive."" ECF 62 at 13-14. However, that case held that a national breed 
club and registry and its regional affiliates were incapable of conspiring because, among other things, the JRTCA and its 
regional affiliates were not alleged to be actual or even potential competitors in the relevant market. Jack Russell Terrier, 407 
F.3d at 1035-36. Here, the member teams of the NWSL compete directly with each other for players' services."
758,5," The NWSL discovery rule permits a player to be discovered at 17, but she cannot play until she is 18. ECF 52 at ¶ 10. "
759,6," At the preliminary injunction hearing, counsel for Defendant for the first time argued that this Court could not find that the Age 
Rule unreasonably restrained trade absent expert testimony from a PhD economist. When asked for authority to support this 
position, counsel pointed the Court to United States v. Am. Express Co., 838 F.3d 179 (2d Cir. 2016) and Major League 
Baseball Properties, Inc. v. Salvino, Inc., 542 F.3d 290 (2d Cir. 2008). To start, counsel should not be raising unbriefed 
arguments for the first time at oral argument. Regardless, the cited cases do not support counsel's position. Neither Am. Express 
Co. nor Salvino stand for the proposition that testimony from economists is always required to prove an unreasonable restraint 
on a relevant market. The relevant market here, the competition for services of professional women soccer players, is controlled 
by a monopsony, the NWSL. It does not require a PhD in economics to see how an anticompetitive rule promulgated by a 
monopsony controlling an entire market has market-wide impact. "
764,*," Together with No. 20-520, American Athletic Conference et al. v. Alston et al., also on certiorari to the same court. "
794,1," The following history is derived from Plaintiff's Complaint (Doc. 1), exhibits attached thereto, and state court records. See 
Brooks v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Fla., Inc., 116 F.3d 1364, 1368 (11th Cir. 1997) (noting that, in considering a motion to 
dismiss, a court may consider both the contents of a complaint and its attachments); see also U.S. ex rel. Osheroff v. Humana 
Inc., 776 F.3d 805, 811-12 n.4 (11th Cir. 2015) (""Courts may take judicial notice of publicly filed documents, such as those in 
state court litigation, at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage."")."
794,2," For purposes of this Order, the Court need not discuss the specific conduct underlying the Board's charges against Plaintiff. A 
recitation of the events and activities that led to the charges can be found in Ala. State Bd. of Pharmacy v. Parks, 296 So. 3d 
316 (Ala. Civ. App. 2019), cert. denied (Oct. 11, 2019). "
795,3," Plaintiff also references, in passing, the Federal Trade Commission Act (""FTC Act""). However, the Eleventh Circuit has made 
clear that ""a private right of action . . . does not exist under the FTC Act."" Holmes v. Ocwen Fin. Corp., 747 F. App'x 836, 837 
(11th Cir. 2019) (citing Jeter v. Credit Bureau, Inc., 760 F.2d 1168, 1174 n.5 (11th Cir. 1985))."
795,4," Defendants also argue that (1) Plaintiff's due process claims are barred by res judicata, barred by collateral estoppel, and fail 
under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6); (2) Plaintiff's antitrust claims fail because Defendants are entitled to state-action, 
or Parker, immunity; (3) the Board is entitled to Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity; and (4) the individual Defendants are 
entitled to quasi-judicial immunity. However, because the Court finds the legal theories above to be dispositive of Plaintiff's 
claims, it need not address Defendants' additional theories for dismissal. "
796,5," Plaintiff stated in her circuit court complaint that she received the Board's final order on or about October 14, 2016 (Parks, 03-
CV-2016-901576.00, Doc. 2 at 2) or October 17, 2016 (Id. at 4). Both dates fall well outside of the two-year statute of limitations."
796,6," See Arezzo v. City of Hoboken, 719 F. App'x 115, 118 (3d Cir. 2018) (rejecting plaintiff's argument that his due process claim 
accrued when the state supreme court denied review, instead finding that it accrued when defendant issued its final 
administrative decision to terminate his employment; ""After [defendant] took final administrative action, [plaintiff] could have filed 
his Section 1983 claim alleging that [defendant] removed him without providing sufficient due process.""); Foudy v. Indian River 
Cty. Sheriff's Office, 845 F.3d 1117, 1123 (11th Cir. 2017) (citing Chardon v. Fernandez, 454 U.S. 6, 8, 102 S. Ct. 28, 70 L. Ed. 
2d 6 (1981) (holding a § 1983 action for unlawful termination accrued when the unlawful act, namely the decision to terminate, 
took place))."
796,7," The Sherman Act is a federal antitrust law enacted in 1890 to prohibit combinations and conspiracies in restraint of trade 
(Section 1) and to regulate monopolies (Section 2). Ramos v. Tomasino, 701 F. App'x 798, 802 (11th Cir. 2017) (citing 15 U.S.C. 
§§ 1-2). As will be discussed below, it is unclear from the Complaint under which section of the Sherman Act Plaintiff purports to 
state a claim. "
797,8," For the reasons stated herein, this allegation—even accepted as true—fails to state an antitrust claim. However, the Court 
notes as an aside that evidence provided by Plaintiff in support of this allegation actually belies it. Indeed, the affidavit of Tony 
Bodiford (Doc. 32-1), attached to Plaintiff's response to the motion to dismiss, does not indicate that any of the named 
Defendants ""were trying to set [Plaintiff] up for charges,"" as Plaintiff suggests. Instead, the affidavit simply indicates that ""Sue 
Roxie, Executive Assistant to Board Secretary, Susan Alverson,"" neither of whom are named as defendants in this action, told 
Bodiford that he could work as a pharmacist for Parks Pharmacy despite his license being expired and that, thereafter, Inspector 
Daniels, who is also not a named defendant in this action, arrived to inspect one of the pharmacies and confiscated Bodiford's 
expired license. Doc. 32-1 at 1. Nowhere does the affidavit state that Defendants were trying to ""set [Plaintiff] up,"" as Plaintiff 
repeatedly indicates. "
798,9," Additionally, throughout her filings, Plaintiff repeatedly states that the individual Defendants are both members of the Board 
and, as pharmacists themselves, active market participants. However, to the extent Plaintiff believes that fact—alone and 
without any further factual development—establishes the requisite injury or harm to competition, she is incorrect. See Robb v. 
Conn. Bd. of Veterinary Med., 157 F. Supp. 3d 130, 146 (D. Conn. 2016) (""[T]o . . . hold that [plaintiff's] bare allegations make 
out an antitrust [claim] would effectively mean that nearly all actions of an adjudicative body controlled by a majority of industrial 
participants would constitute an antitrust [claim] per se, an unsupportable argument . . . .""); see also Ala. Power Co. v. Ala. Elec. 
Co-op., Inc., 394 F.2d 672, 677 (5th Cir. 1968) (""The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that, where a restraint upon trade or 
monopolization is the result of valid governmental action, as opposed to private action, no violation of the [Sherman] Act can be 
made out."") (citations omitted)."
798,10," See Rooker v. Fid. Tr. Co., 263 U.S. 413, 44 S. Ct. 149, 68 L. Ed. 362 (1923); D.C. Ct. of Appeals v. Feldman, 460 U.S. 462, 
103 S. Ct. 1303, 75 L. Ed. 2d 206 (1983)."
798,11," In their motion, Defendants only address the applicability of Rooker-Feldman to Plaintiff's due process claims, not her antitrust 
claims. However, because the doctrine is jurisdictional, the Court may consider the doctrine's application to all of Plaintiff's 
claims sua sponte. See Jackson v. Farmers Ins. Grp./Fire Ins. Exch., 391 F. App'x 854, 856-57 (11th Cir. 2010) (affirming sua 
sponte dismissal of plaintiff's complaint under Rooker-Feldman and stating that ""a district court may sua sponte consider subject 
matter jurisdiction at any stage in the litigation and must dismiss a complaint if it concludes that subject matter jurisdiction is 
lacking""). "
799,12," In her response to the motion to dismiss, ""Plaintiff concedes that the issues before this Court [are] identical to the issues at the 
administrative hearing [before the Board]."" Doc. 32 at 34. In her subsequent sur-reply, she admits that she ""prayed the [circuit 
court] to review the legalities of Defendants' actions, and reverse [the Board's] decision."" Doc. 34 at 15. She also makes clear 
throughout her various responses that the issues presented here and the issues considered in state court are premised on the 
same acts and events."
799,13," As noted above, Plaintiff admits that she ""prayed the [circuit court] to review the legalities of Defendants' actions, and reverse 
[the Board's] decision,"" but the court found no illegalities and affirmed the Board's decision, determining ""that Plaintiff was . . . 
guilty of the charges filed by Defendants."" Doc. 32 at 12-13."
799,14," Indeed, Plaintiff states in her complaint and throughout her various responses that Defendants have violated the Sherman Act 
""by suspending her personal license . . . and business permits and licenses"" (Doc. 34 at 6, n.3) and not following proper 
procedure in conducting her inspections and subsequent hearing (Id. at 8, n.4). "
800,15," See also Sarhan v. Rothenberg, No. 07-22818, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 48901, 2008 WL 2474645, at *11 (S.D. Fla. June 17, 
2008) (""A litigant may not circumvent [Rooker-Feldman] by instituting a federal action which, although not styled as an appeal, 
'amounts to nothing more than an attempt to seek review of [the state court's] decision by a lower federal court.'"" (quoting Am. 
Reliable Ins. Co. v. Stillwell, 336 F.3d 311, 316 (4th Cir. 2003)); Scannell v. Wash. State Bar Ass'n, No. 12-00683, 2013 U.S.

action than were chosen in the State Court, but the parties are essentially the same, Plaintiff's goal is the same, and the only real 
effect of his additional claims, including his RICO and Sherman Anti-Trust Act charges, is to provide additional grounds to 
overturn [defendant's] decision to disbar him.""); Guerrero v. Bensalem Racing Ass'n, Inc., 25 F. Supp. 3d 573, 584 (E.D. Pa. 
2014) (holding plaintiff's Sherman Act claims were barred by Rooker-Feldman and stating, ""Plaintiff's 'manufactured effort' to re-
characterize the source of his injuries is insufficient to circumvent the Rooker—Feldman bar."") (citations omitted); Stern v. Nix, 
840 F.2d 208, 212 (3d Cir. 1988) (""Despite this genuflecting to the Rooker-Feldman doctrine, closer consideration convinces us 
that [plaintiff's] complaint is simply a skillful attempt to mask the true purpose of the action, which essentially is to reverse the 
judicial decision of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, in contravention of Rooker-Feldman.""), cert. denied 488 U.S. 826, 109 
S. Ct. 77, 102 L. Ed. 2d 53 (1988)). "
806,1," The named plaintiff in this action was J.P. Morgan Trust Company in its capacity as the Liquidating Trustee of the Farmland 
Industries Liquidating Trust. "
807,2," Farmland's complaint was brought pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann §§ 50-101, -108, -112, -115, -117, and -161. "
808,3, Neither party has asked this court to certify the retroactivity question to the Kansas Supreme Court. 
809,4," Our retroactivity analysis has no bearing on whether the damages provisions of the KRTA are procedural or substantive for 
purposes of Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 58 S. Ct. 817, 82 L. Ed. 1188 (1938)."
809,5," Section 50-115 also gave any person injured or damaged by the conduct set out in § 50-112 the right to ""sue for"" full 
consideration damages. But this appeal does not involve the question of whether a provision creating a private right of action is 
substantive or procedural. Further, the repeal of § 50-115 had no affect on the ability of ""any person who may be damaged or 
injured by any agreement, monopoly, trust, conspiracy or combination which is declared unlawful by the Kansas restraint of 
trade act"" to bring suit pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. § 50-161(b). And, more to the point, Appellants have not argued Farmland's 
suit should be dismissed because the repeal of § 50-115 retroactively stripped Farmland of the right to bring a cause of action 
alleging a violation of § 50-112. Appellants have argued only that Farmland can no longer seek full consideration damages as a 
result of the repeal of § 50-115. Accordingly, our review is limited to the damages provision of § 50-115. "
810,6," For the same reasons, the Kansas Supreme Court's decision in In re Estate of Laue, 225 Kan. 177, 589 P.2d 558 (Kan. 1979), 
does not support Farmland's argument that the repeal of § 50-115 was substantive. In re Estate of Laue involved an amendment 
to the statutory allowance of a surviving spouse. Id. at 567. Like the change at issue in Kleibrink, the statutory amendment in In 
re Estate of Laue was substantive because it legislatively established the amount to which the surviving spouse was entitled. 
The Kansas Supreme Court noted ""[t]he statutory allowance does not involve a mere remedy or procedure."" Id. Again, that is not 
the situation presented in this matter because § 50-115 did not dictate a minimum or maximum damages award prior to its 
repeal."
810,7," Further, the Supreme Court's decision in Landgraf was not grounded in Kansas law and the issue currently before this court 
involves only a question of Kansas law. "
812,8, Farmland has not argued the treble damages remedy set out in § 50-161(b) is insufficient to make a plaintiff whole. 
813,9," We note the United States District Court for the District of Nevada concluded the repeal of § 50-115 operates retroactively. In re 
W. States Wholesale Nat. Gas Antitrust Litig., MDL No. 1566, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 134890, 2017 WL 3610553, at *3-*4 (D. 
Nev. Aug. 22, 2017), rev'd on other grounds by 743 F. App'x 802 (9th Cir. 2018). That ruling was based on the district court's 
conclusion the statute was remedial, not substantive. 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 134890, [WL] at *3. The court, however, did not 
engage in any extended analysis of why § 50-115 was remedial or examine whether retroactive application of its repeal would 
affect vested rights. "
814,10," Ironically, Appellants seek summary judgment from this court but also assert the controlling legal question of whether 
Farmland's complaint sufficiently preserves the treble damages remedy is not properly before us as part of this interlocutory 
appeal. HN19[
] This court, however, has previously exercised its discretion in an interlocutory appeal to resolve whether a 
party is entitled to summary judgment even though the district court did not expressly certify the question of whether a genuine 
issue of material fact precluded summary judgment. Rural Water Dist. No. 4 v. City of Eudora, 720 F.3d 1269, 1278 (10th Cir. 
2013). Under the standard set out in City of Eudora, we should exercise our discretion ""if an issue is 'fairly included within the 
certified order' and is 'a controlling question of law.'"" Id. Here, the district court's order certifying this interlocutory appeal 
addressed the parameters of Farmland's complaint, concluding it did not preserve the treble damages remedy. That conclusion, 
while erroneous, was one basis on which the district court certified this interlocutory appeal. It is also central to the question 
presented in the district court's retroactivity order, i.e., whether Farmland has no available remedies if it prevails on the merits of 
its KRTA claims. See supra § III. D. Thus, we conclude the issue is ""fairly included within the certified order"" and must be 
addressed to resolve ""a controlling question of law."" In the interest of judicial economy, we exercise our discretion to resolve it."
814,11," The parties have not directed this court to any pretrial order refining or narrowing the scope of the damages recoverable by 
Farmland."
814,12," Although Appellants assert in a single phrase in their reply brief that they will be prejudiced if Farmland is permitted to pursue 
the treble damages remedy, they do not explain the nature of this alleged prejudice in any detail. And, in any event, even if 
prejudice may be relevant to what evidence Farmland is permitted to present on the treble-damages issue, it is not relevant to 
the purely legal question of whether Farmland's amended complaint is sufficient to preserve the treble damages remedy. "
840,1," The named defendants in this case are: Mylan N.V., Mylan Specialty L.P., Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc., and Heather Bresch 
(collectively ""Mylan"") and Pfizer, Inc., King Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (n/k/a King Pharmaceuticals LLC), and Meridian Medical 
Technologies, Inc. (collectively ""Pfizer""). Doc. 2169 at 1 (Pretrial Order). This Order rules just the summary judgment motion filed by the Mylan defendants (Doc. 2141). Thus, the court's references to 
""defendants"" in this Order refer only to the Mylan defendants unless specifically noted that the term is meant to refer to other 
named defendants in this action."
840,2," Plaintiffs assert their state antitrust claims under the laws of the following states: Alabama, California, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, 
Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, Tennessee, 
and Utah. Doc. 2169 at 2 n.3, 44-45 (Pretrial Order ¶¶ 1.d., 4.d.)."
840,3," Defendants' summary judgment motion asks ""that a hearing be set for oral argument"" on the motion ""if the Court believes that 
would be helpful."" Doc. 2141 at 2. Our court's local rule provides: ""The court may set any motion for oral argument or hearing at 
the request of a party or on its own initiative."" D. Kan. Rule 7.2. The court carefully has reviewed the parties' written 
submissions. And, the parties' papers have explained their positions quite effectively. The court finds that oral argument will not 
assist its work. Also, it concludes that ordering oral argument here would contradict Fed. R. Civ. P. 1. So, the court denies 
defendants' request to set the matter for oral argument. Also, the court enters this Order as a publicly-available document on the court's docket. The court recognizes that the parties 
have moved for leave to file under seal portions of their summary judgment briefs as well as many of the exhibits submitted 
either supporting or opposing the summary judgment motion. But, HN1[
] the public enjoys a ""common-law right of access"" to 
judicial records. Nixon v. Warner Communications, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 599, 98 S. Ct. 1306, 55 L. Ed. 2d 570 (1978); United 
States v. Bacon, 950 F.3d 1286, 1292 (10th Cir. 2020). A litigant can rebut the ""strong presumption in favor of public access"" 
when ""countervailing interests heavily outweigh the public interests in access to the judicial record."" Bacon, 950 F.3d at 1293 
(citations and internal quotation marks omitted). The court finds that none of the information in this Order qualifies for sealing 
under the governing legal standard for several reasons. First, HN2[
] the court's summary judgment analysis relies on the 
factual information submitted by the parties to determine the litigants' rights; so, the public has a strong interest in accessing the 
information. See Riker v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, 315 F. App'x 752, 755 (10th Cir. 2009) (""Especially 'where documents are 
used to determine litigants' substantive legal rights, a strong presumption of access attaches.'"" (quoting Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. 
of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110, 121 (2d Cir. 2006))). Second, a good portion of the factual information already is publicly-available 
through other sources. And third, most of this information is quite stale—ranging in date from 2007 to 2017. The court finds that 
the public's right to access the entire contents of this Order to understand the summary judgment facts and the court's analysis 
of plaintiffs' antitrust claims and RICO claims outweighs any privacy interest that the parties assert over the information. "
841,4," Plaintiffs don't controvert this statement of fact, but they argue that this exhibit is inadmissible hearsay for which no exception 
applies. Doc. 2190-1 at 20, 77; see also Doc. 2226-3 at 2 (discussing ""SMF ¶ 1""). Defendants respond that the exhibit—a 
scholarly medical article—is admissible under the residual hearsay exception of Fed. R. Evid. 807. Doc. 2226-1 at 21. Even if 
defendants' cited exhibit doesn't qualify for admission under Rule 807, the parties have stipulated to the following factual 
statement that contains information almost identical to the fact supported by defendants' summary judgment exhibit: 
""Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening allergic reaction that can occur rapidly after exposure to an allergen."" Doc. 2169 at 3 (Pretrial 
Order ¶ 2.a.14.)."
841,5, Plaintiffs have submitted the hearing's transcript as part of the summary judgment record. Doc. 2207-17 (Pls.' Ex. 349).
841,6," Meridian now is a subsidiary of Pfizer, Inc. Doc. 2169 at 3 (Pretrial Order ¶ 10). Pfizer acquired King Pharmaceuticals LLC 
(""King"") and Meridian in 2011. Id. And now, Meridian and King are indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of Pfizer, Inc. Id. (Pretrial 
Order ¶¶ 2.a.6., 2.a.10.). This Order refers to Pfizer, Meridian, and King collectively as ""Pfizer"" unless otherwise noted."
841,7," Plaintiffs assert that this exhibit constitutes inadmissible hearsay to which no exception applies. Doc. 2190-1 at 77. Defendants 
respond that this document is admissible under the business records exception to hearsay under Fed. R. Evid. 803(6). Doc. 
2226-1 at 21. Defendants have the better argument because this exhibit—an internal Mylan document—appears to qualify as a 
business record under the hearsay exception of Fed. R. Evid. 803(6). "
842,8," Like the exhibit discussed in the preceding footnote, plaintiffs assert that defendants' Exhibit 13 is inadmissible hearsay. Doc. 
2190-1 at 77. Indeed, plaintiffs assert that more than 150 of defendants' exhibits are inadmissible hearsay. See id. Defendants 
respond that Exhibit 13—along with hundreds of others of their summary judgment exhibits—are admissible under the business 
records exception to the hearsay rule under Fed. R. Evid. 803(6). Doc. 2226-1 at 21; see also Doc. 2227-1 at 11-12 
(Cuthbertson Decl.). Each of these exhibits that defendants cite as admissible under Fed. R. Evid. 803(6) are internal Mylan 
records. For the same reasons discussed above, supra note 7, the court finds that Exhibit 13—as well as the other, challenged 
exhibits that are internal Mylan business records—are admissible under Fed. R. Evid. 803(6)'s business records exception to the 
hearsay rule. Also, the court finds plaintiffs' blanket hearsay objections to Mylan documents disingenuous. Plaintiffs themselves rely on many 
Mylan-produced business records to support their asserted summary judgment facts. For example, plaintiffs assert a hearsay 
objection to defendants' Exhibit 100. See Doc. 2190-1 at 77 (objecting to defendants' Exhibit 100 (Doc. 2167-2)). And, with their 
blanket hearsay objection, plaintiffs assert: ""At the very least, the Court should not consider any of the exhibits and other 
documents specifically identified in this paragraph because Defendants failed to meet their burden of showing the documents' 
admissibility at trial."" Id. (emphasis added). Incredibly, while plaintiffs ask the court to ignore defendants' Exhibit 100 (and 
hundreds of other documents defendants submitted as summary judgment exhibits), plaintiffs also cite the very same document 
to support one of their summary judgment facts. See Doc. 2190-1 at 69 (Statement of Additional Material Fact ¶ 147) (citing Pls.' 
Ex. 322 (Doc. 2207-14 at 2-15)). This is not the only example. The court identifies more in footnotes below. Plaintiffs provide no 
explanation for why they contend the court should consider their proffered exhibits as admissible evidence under the Federal 
Rules of Evidence but simultaneously preclude defendants from offering the very same evidence on summary judgment. The 
court is unimpressed with plaintiffs' tactic. The only thing it has accomplished is complicating the court's work."
842,9," Defendants cite these news reports, but don't attach them as exhibits to their summary judgment motion. Plaintiffs complain 
that these two news reports—along with some 56 other documents that defendants have cited to support their summary 
judgment facts—aren't attached as exhibits to their summary judgment motion. Doc. 2190-1 at 76-77. And, plaintiffs argue that 
the unattached exhibits are inadmissible hearsay for which no exception applies. Id. To the extent plaintiffs challenge 
defendants' citation to these news articles because they aren't attached as summary judgment exhibits, see id. at 76-77, the 
court rejects that challenge because plaintiffs also don't controvert the summary judgment facts cited in this statement of fact, 
see id. at 20. Also, the court rejects plaintiffs' hearsay challenge because defendants don't offer these news articles to prove the 
truth of the matters asserted. Instead, they offer them to show the information—true or not—that Mylan considered when 
deciding how to sell and market the EpiPen. Thus, these exhibits don't qualify as hearsay under Fed. R. Evid. 801(c). See infra 
n.12."
842,10," The citation defendants provide for this statement of fact is no longer available online, but plaintiffs don't controvert this fact. 
So, the court accepts it for this summary judgment motion. "
843,11," This fact is tied to another public record—a press release—that defendants didn't attach as a summary judgment exhibit. To 
the extent plaintiffs object to this citation, the court rejects that objection. This press release is publicly available online, and likely 
qualifies as a Mylan business record that is admissible under Fed. R. Evid. 803(6)'s exception to the hearsay rule. "
844,12," Plaintiffs assert that this exhibit is inadmissible hearsay for which no exception applies. Doc. 2190-1 at 20. Plaintiffs make this 
same objection to more than 40 of defendants' exhibits—many of which are scholarly medical articles. Id. Defendants respond 
that each exhibit is admissible under the residual hearsay exception of Fed. R. Evid. 807. Doc. 2226-1 at 21. HN3[
] Rule "
845,807," (a) provides an exception permitting the admission of hearsay evidence if ""(1) the statement is supported by sufficient 
guarantees of trustworthiness . . . and (2) it is more probative on the point for which it is offered than any other evidence that the 
proponent can obtain through reasonable efforts."" Fed. R. Evid. 807(a). The parties haven't provided the court enough 
information here to determine whether the scholarly medical articles at issue satisfy both requirements of Rule 807's residual 
exception. And, as our court has noted before, ""HN4[
] scholarly articles, standing alone, contain inadmissible hearsay and 
have limited utility under the Federal Rules of Evidence."" In re Universal Serv. Fund Tel. Billing Pracs. Litig., No. 02-MD-1468-
JWL, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 34542, 2008 WL 1884125, at *2 (D. Kan. Apr. 25, 2008). Nevertheless, the court considers the scholarly articles because they aren't hearsay evidence in the context of this summary 
judgment motion. HN5[
] The Federal Rules of Evidence define hearsay as ""a statement that: (1) the declarant does not make 
while testifying at the current trial or hearing; and (2) a party offers in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted in the 
statement."" Fed. R. Evid. 801(c). But, statements that are offered for purposes other than proving the truth of the matter asserted 
don't count as hearsay. See, e.g., Faulkner v. Super Valu Stores, Inc., 3 F.3d 1419, 1434-35 (10th Cir. 1993) (holding that 
statements about job applicants' bad conduct wasn't hearsay because they weren't offered to prove the truth of the matter 
asserted but instead offered to establish the employer's state of mind when it decided not to hire applicants); Allen v. 
Montgomery, 728 F.2d 1409, 1412 (11th Cir. 1984) (recognizing that newspaper articles about jury sequestration during a 
criminal trial ""were not objectionable as hearsay because they were not offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted—that 
the jury stayed with the sheriff"" but instead were offered ""to establish . . . pretrial publicity""); Eaton v. Harsha, 505 F. Supp. 2d 
948, 952-53 nn. 4 & 6 (D. Kan. 2007) (Robinson, J.) (finding that statements made to a police chief by members of the public 
who had complained that two police officers had made offensive and racially insensitive comments were not hearsay because 
statements weren't offered to prove the truth of the matters asserted by the complaints—i.e., that the police officers' comments 
were offensive and racially insensitive—but instead to show that the police chief had received complaints from community 
members). In short, a statement that is offered to show its effect on the listener isn't hearsay because it isn't offered to prove the 
truth of the matter asserted—i.e., to prove the truth of the contents of the declarant's statement—but instead is offered to prove 
how the statement affected the person who heard the statement. See United States v. Smalls, 605 F.3d 765, 785 n.18 (10th Cir. 
2010) (holding that statements weren't inadmissible hearsay when ""they are not offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, 
but rather are offered to establish their effect on [the listener] and provide context for his statement""); see also Schindler v. 
Seiler, 474 F.3d 1008, 1010 (7th Cir. 2007) (explaining that ""a statement offered to show its effect on the person who heard the 
statement is not hearsay"" (citing United States v. Robinzine, 80 F.3d 246, 252 (7th Cir. 1996)). Here, defendants don't offer the scholarly articles to prove that their contents are true. Instead, defendants offer them as 
evidence of the relevant medical guidance about anaphylaxis and the proper treatment for that condition that Mylan asserts it 
considered when marketing and selling the EpiPen. To illustrate the principle, defendants don't offer the NIAID Guidelines to 
prove the truth of the Guidelines' contents about appropriate treatment of anaphylaxis or the number of epinephrine doses 
required to treat an anaphylactic reaction. Instead, defendants offer the NIAID Guidelines to show how they affected Mylan and 
its decision to discontinue selling single EpiPens and switch to selling EpiPens exclusively in a 2-Pak. So, because defendants 
don't offer the NIAID Guidelines to prove the truth of the matter asserted, the exhibit isn't hearsay. And, plaintiffs provide no 
other reason to exclude it from the summary judgment evidence. Moreover, the court observes that plaintiffs object to many of defendants' exhibits as inadmissible hearsay, but then they turn 
around and rely on those same documents to support their statements of additional material facts. Compare Doc. 2190-1 at 77 
(objecting to defendants' Exhibits 34, 36, 38-48 as inadmissible hearsay) with id. at 39 (relying on defendants' Exhibits 34, 36, 
46, 47, & 48 to support plaintiffs' Statement of Additional Material Fact ¶ 12). Plaintiffs' blanket hearsay objections—which the 
court has attempted to address thoroughly in this order—have increased the court's work substantially. And, plaintiffs' practice of 
objecting to exhibits that they also rely on as summary judgment evidence appears to contravene Rule 1's directive to the parties 
to ""employ[ ]"" the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure—including Rule 56—""to secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive 
determination of every action and proceeding."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 1. "
846,13," The ""reported incidence of biphasic anaphylactic reactions varies from 1% to 20%"" but typically are ""mild, tend to be self-
limited, and have not required additional epinephrine."" Doc. 2164-17 at 2, 7 (Defs.' Ex. 43). "
850,14," Plaintiffs object that this exhibit contains inadmissible hearsay. Doc. 2190-1 at 77. Defendants respond that it qualifies as a 
business record under Fed. R. Evid. 803(6)'s exception to the hearsay rule. Doc. 2226-1 at 21. They also argue that it doesn't 
qualify as hearsay because defendants don't offer the exhibit to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Id. The court agrees with 
defendants on the latter point. Defendants don't offer this exhibit to prove that it was a ""good idea"" to sell EpiPens exclusively in 
a 2-Pak. Instead, they offer it to show what Dr. Lieberman—as a member of the NIAID expert panel—told Mylan about its 
decision to discontinue selling single EpiPens. "
851,15," One plaintiff, Donna Dvorak, when asked whether she had seen the press release, testified, ""I think I have[,]"" but she wasn't 
""sure when [she] first saw"" it, and she testified that she didn't ""think that [the press release] would have influenced"" her decision 
to purchase an EpiPen. Doc. 2144-3 at 9 (Defs.' Ex. 73) (Dvorak Dep. 340:2-22)."
851,16," Plaintiffs assert defendants' Exhibit 102 is inadmissible hearsay. Doc. 2190-1 at 77. Defendants respond that: (1) the exhibit's 
contents aren't hearsay under Fed. R. Evid. 801(c)(2)'s definition of hearsay; and (2) the contents qualify as an admission by a 
party opponent under Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2). Doc. 2226-1 at 21. Exhibit 102 is a summary of each plaintiff's EAI purchasing 
history and deposition testimony about purchasing EAIs with citations to the supporting evidence which is attached to Exhibit 
102 as Exhibits 102-A-102-Z. See Doc. 2144-16 at 14-177. Exhibit 102 accurately cites the supporting exhibits, which plaintiffs 
don't challenge as inadmissible on summary judgment. So, the court considers the evidence summarized in Exhibit 102 because 
the supporting exhibits accurately support the evidence presented in summary fashion. And, HN6[
] under Fed. R. Evid. 1006, a summary is admissible ""to prove the content of voluminous writings . . . that cannot be conveniently examined in court."" "
852,17," Plaintiffs object that this exhibit is inadmissible hearsay to which no exception applies. Doc. 2190-1 at 77. Defendants respond 
that this letter from the FDA is a public record that qualifies for admission under Fed. R. Evid. 803(8)'s exception to the hearsay 
rule. Doc. 2226-1 at 21. HN7[
] Rule 803(8)'s public records exception to the hearsay rule defines a public record as: A record or statement of a public office if: (A) it sets out: (i) the office's activities; (ii) a matter observed while under a legal 
duty to report, but not including, in a criminal case, a matter observed by law enforcement personnel; or (iii) in a civil case 
or against the government in a criminal case, factual findings from a legally authorized investigation; and (B) the opponent 
does not show that the source of the information or other circumstances indicate a lack of trustworthiness. Fed. R. Evid. 803(8). The advisory committee's notes explain that the ""[j]ustification for the exception is the assumption that a 
public official will perform his duty properly and the unlikelihood that he will remember details independently of the record."" Fed. 
R. Evid. 803 advisory committee's note to Paragraph (8). And, cases ""illustrating the admissibility of records of the office's or 
agency's own activities are numerous."" Id. The court agrees that defendants' Exhibit 98 falls within the public records exception 
to the hearsay rule because it is a record of a public office—the FDA—setting out its activities and plaintiffs have marshaled no 
circumstances ""indicat[ing] a lack of trustworthiness"" with the document. Fed. R. Evid. 803(8). Also, once again, plaintiffs object to an exhibit that they then turn around and cite as an exhibit supporting their own asserted 
summary judgment facts. See Doc. 2190-1 at 42 (Statement of Additional Material Fact ¶ 24 (citing Pls.' Ex. 22)). Plaintiffs' 
Exhibit 22 is the very same document as defendants' Exhibit 98—all the way down to the Bates numbering. Again, plaintiffs' cat-
and-mouse tactics—asserting blanket evidentiary objections to defendants' summary judgment exhibits while relying themselves 
on the same exhibits—is unimpressive advocacy. "
853,18," The court rejects plaintiffs' objection that defendants' Exhibit 101 is inadmissible hearsay to which no exception applies. Doc. 
2190-1 at 77. As defendants have shown, documents produced by Teva qualify for admission as business records under Fed. R. 
Evid. 803(6)'s exception to the hearsay rule. Doc. 2226-1 at 21 & n.35; see also Doc. 2227-1 at 15-17 (Savage Decl. Concerning 
Teva Docs.). For the same reasons, the court rejects plaintiffs' objections to defendants' Exhibits 104, 106, 108, 114, 117-28, 
131-33, 144-52, 159-60, & 163. All of these exhibits consist of Teva-produced business records that qualify for admission under 
Fed. R. Evid. 803(6)'s exception to the hearsay rule."
853,19," An A-rating (sometimes referred to as ""AB"" or ""AP"" in the context of injectable products) signifies that two products are 
""therapeutically equivalent"" and can be substituted for one another at the pharmacy counter. Approved Drug Products with 
Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (""Orange Book Preface""), FDA at ¶ 1.7 (last updated Jan. 21, 2021), 
https://www.fda.gov/drugs/development-approval-process-drugs/orange-book-preface."
853,20," Plaintiffs dispute that the '012 Patent was a valid patent. But, that dispute doesn't controvert the undisputed fact that Meridian 
held the '012 Patent when Teva filed its ANDA. See United States v. You, No. 2:19-CR-14, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 74813, 2021 "
854,," WL 1539579, at *3 (E.D. Tenn. Apr. 19, 2021) (""HN9[
] The fact that some patents might not be valid does not affect the fact 
that a patent filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office remains part of the public record.""). Also, plaintiffs object that defendants' Ex. 105 is inadmissible hearsay to which no exception applies. Doc. 2190-1 at 77. The 
court disagrees. The '012 Patent itself likely doesn't qualify as hearsay because defendants don't offer the '012 Patent to prove 
any of its contents, but even if they did, the '012 Patent is a public record that qualifies for admission under Fed. R. Evid. 803(8). 
See Hay & Forage Indus. v. New Holland N. Am., Inc., 25 F. Supp. 2d 1170, 1175 n.2 (D. Kan. 1998) (holding that HN10[
] 
patents were admissible evidence because ""the documents offered are not hearsay"" when they were offered ""not to prove the 
truth of any of the matters which they assert, but rather to prove that various patents use"" a particular term, but in ""any event, 
even if the patents were hearsay, they would be subject to the public records exception to the hearsay rule"" (citing Fed. R. Evid. 
803(8))). Cf. SB IP Holdings, LLC v. Vivint Smart Home, Inc., No. 4:20-cv-886, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 82871, 2021 WL 1721715, 
at *1 (E.D. Tex. Apr. 30, 2021) (""Courts routinely take judicial notice of patents, prosecution history, and patent applications."")."
854,21," HN11[
] A citizen petition is a document that anyone may submit to the FDA asking it ""to issue, amend, or revoke a regulation or order, or to take or refrain from taking any other form of administrative action."" 21 C.F.R. § 10.25(a)."
854,22," Again, plaintiffs object to this exhibit as inadmissible hearsay to which no exception applies. Doc. 2190-1 at 77. Defendants 
respond that this FDA response letter is a public record that qualifies for admission under Fed. R. Evid. 803(8)'s exception to the 
hearsay rule. Doc. 2226-1 at 21. The court agrees. Defendants' Exhibit 99 falls within the public records exception to the hearsay 
rule in Fed. R. Evid. 803(8) because it is a record of a public office setting out its activities and plaintiffs have not shown any 
circumstances indicating a lack of trustworthiness with the document. "
855,23," The court rejects plaintiffs' objection that defendants' Exhibit 100 is inadmissible hearsay to which no exception applies. The 
court finds that this document arguably qualifies for admission under Fed. R. Evid. 803(8)'s public record exception to the 
hearsay rule. Also, it qualifies as a business record under Fed. R. Evid. 803(6)'s exception to the hearsay rule. And, plaintiffs 
have submitted the exact same document as part of an exhibit supporting their own asserted summary judgment facts. Doc. 
2190-1 at 69 (Statement of Additional Material Fact ¶ 147) (citing Pls.' Ex. 322 (Doc. 2207-14 at 2-15)). This ploy is no more 
impressive than plaintiffs' other similar attempts to enforce a ""heads I win, tails you lose"" paradigm."
855,24," The court rejects plaintiffs' objection to defendants' Exhibit 113 as inadmissible hearsay to which no exception applies. Doc. 
2190-1 at 20. Defendants assert that this exhibit doesn't qualify as hearsay because it's not offered to prove the truth of the 
matter asserted. Doc. 2226-1 at 21. The court agrees. Defendants don't offer this exhibit to prove the truth of any of its contents. 
Instead, it is offered to show that Teva was communicating with the FDA about its ANDA for its proposed generic EAI. So, this 
exhibit isn't inadmissible hearsay under Fed. R. Evid. 801(c)."
855,25," The court rejects plaintiffs' objection to defendants' Exhibit 115 as inadmissible hearsay to which no exception applies. Doc. 
2190-1 at 20. Defendants assert that this exhibit qualifies as a public record subject to Fed. R. Evid. 803(8)'s exception to the 
hearsay rule. Doc. 2226-1 at 21. The court agrees for the same reasons discussed supra note 17. "
856,26," The court rejects plaintiffs' objection to defendants' Exhibit 116 as inadmissible hearsay to which no exception applies. Doc. 
2190-1 at 20. Defendants assert that this exhibit qualifies as a public record subject to Fed. R. Evid. 803(8)'s exception to the 
hearsay rule. Doc. 2226-1 at 21. The court agrees for the same reasons discussed supra n.17. "
857,27," The court rejects plaintiffs' objections to defendants' Exhibits 134 and 135 as inadmissible hearsay to which no exception 
applies. Doc. 2190-1 at 77. Exhibit 134 is a patent which likely doesn't qualify as hearsay because defendants don't offer the 
'827 Patent to prove any of its contents. But even if they had offered the exhibit to prove the truth of its contents, the '827 Patent 
is a public record that qualifies for admission under Fed. R. Evid. 803(8). See supra n.20. And Exhibit 135 is a Mylan business 
record that qualifies for admission under Fed. R. Evid. 803(6)'s business records exception. "
858,28," Plaintiffs object that this exhibit is inadmissible hearsay for which no exception applies. Doc. 2190-1 at 77. But, plaintiffs don't 
controvert the statement of fact that relies on it. Id. at 20; see also Doc. 2226-3 at 34 (discussing ""SMF ¶ 93""). And, as 
defendants respond, Exhibit 142 is admissible because it's not hearsay. Doc. 2226-1 at 21. Defendants don't offer the press 
release to prove the truth of the matter of any of the contents in the press release. And, even if it is hearsay, the Mylan press 
release likely qualifies as a business record subject to Fed. R. Evid. 803(6)'s exception to the hearsay rule. "
860,29," The court rejects plaintiffs' objection to Exhibit 154—as well as Exhibits 155 and 156—based on inadmissible hearsay. Doc. 
2190-1 at 77. As defendants correctly argue, these exhibits don't qualify as hearsay under Fed. R. Evid. 801(c)(2)'s definition of 
hearsay evidence because defendants don't offer the exhibits to prove the truth of the matters asserted in the documents. 
Instead, they offer the exhibits to show that Mylan communicated with the FDA about Teva's ANDA. Also, again, the court notes 
that plaintiffs have objected to defendants' Exhibit 154, but yet plaintiffs rely on the very same document—plaintiffs' Exhibit 
325—as support for one of their summary judgment facts. Doc. 2190-1 at 70 (plaintiffs' Statement of Additional Material Fact ¶ 
152 (citing Pls.' Ex. 325 (Doc. 2204-4)))."
860,30," The court rejects plaintiffs' objection to Exhibit 157—as well as Exhibits 158 and 160—based on inadmissible hearsay. Doc. 
2190-1 at 77. As defendants correctly argue, these exhibits are public records that qualify for admission under Fed. R. Evid. 
803(8)'s exception to the hearsay rule. "
861,31," A complete response letter is a letter the FDA sends to an applicant ""if the agency determines that [it] will not approve the 
application or abbreviated application in its present form[.]"" 21 C.F.R. § 314.110(a)."
861,32," To the extent plaintiffs challenge defendants' citation to these news articles because they aren't attached as summary 
judgment exhibits, see Doc. 2190-1 at 76-77, the court rejects that challenge because plaintiffs don't controvert the summary 
judgment facts cited in this statement of fact, see Doc. 2190-1 at 20. "
862,33," Cephalon continued to litigate the Nuvigil litigation as Cephalon even after Teva acquired it. The parties refer to Cephalon as 
Teva going forward, and the court adopts that convention. "
863,34," The court rejects plaintiffs' objection to Exhibits 164 and 165 based on inadmissible hearsay. Doc. 2190-1 at 77. As 
defendants correctly argue, these exhibits don't qualify as hearsay under Fed. R. Evid. 801(c)(2)'s definition of hearsay because 
defendants don't offer the exhibits to prove the truth of the matters asserted in the documents. Instead, they offer the exhibits to 
show Mylan and Teva exchanged a binding term sheet."
863,35," The court rejects plaintiffs' objection to Exhibit 171 based on inadmissible hearsay. Doc. 2190-1 at 77. As defendants correctly 
argue, this letter from the FDA qualifies as a business record under Fed. R. Evid. 803(6)'s exception to the hearsay rule. Also, 
this exhibit—a letter from the FDA—likely is a public record that qualifies for admission under Fed. R. Evid. 803(8)'s exception to 
the hearsay rule. "
864,36," The citation defendants provide for this statement of fact is no longer available online, but plaintiffs don't controvert this 
statement of fact. See Docs. 2142-1 at 50, 2190-1 at 20; see also Doc. 2226-3 at 40 (discussing ""SMF ¶ 118""). So, the court 
accepts it for purposes of this summary judgment motion."
864,37," The court rejects plaintiffs' objection to Exhibit 169 based on inadmissible hearsay. Doc. 2190-1 at 77. As defendants correctly 
argue, this letter from the FDA qualifies as a public record that is admissible under Fed. R. Evid. 803(8)'s exception to the 
hearsay rule. Also, plaintiffs quote language from this letter to support one of their own statements of fact. Doc. 2190-1 at 63 
(plaintiffs' Statement of Additional Material Fact ¶ 118). While the court understands that some hearsay issues can turn on the 
identity of the offering party, see Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2), that isn't the case here. Plaintiffs have used the same FDA letter to 
support their facts, but also they object to defendants using it. This tact is not impressive. "
865,38," The court rejects plaintiffs' objection to Exhibit 176—as well as Exhibits 177, 178, 179, 180, & 181—based on plaintiffs' 
argument that the documents are inadmissible hearsay to which no exception applies. Doc. 2190-1 at 77. These documents 
produced by Mylan qualify for admission as business records under Fed. R. Evid. 803(6)'s exception to the hearsay rule. Doc. 
2226-1 at 21; see also Doc. 2227-1 at 11-12 (Cuthbertson Decl.). "
868,39," Once again, plaintiffs assert an objection to defendants' exhibit offered as evidentiary support for this factual statement. 
Defendants' Exhibit 222 is Sanofi's License and Development Agreement with Intelliject that granted Sanofi the right to market 
and sell Auvi-Q. Plaintiffs assert this Agreement is inadmissible hearsay to which no exception applies. Doc. 2190-1 at 77. 
Defendants respond that this document qualifies as a business record that is admissible under Fed. R. Evid. 803(6)'s exception 
to the hearsay rule. Doc. 2226-1 at 21. The court agrees. This document was produced by Sanofi. See generally Doc. 2155-8 
(Sanofi Bates-numbered document). It's an Agreement that it entered in the course of its business. And, it likely qualifies as a 
business record that is admissible under the exception to the hearsay rule. Fed. R. Evid. 803(6). Also, because this exhibit is a 
contract, it isn't hearsay because it has independent legal significance. See Kepner-Tregoe, Inc. v. Leadership Software, Inc., 12 
F.3d 527, 540 (5th Cir. 1994) (""HN12[
] Signed instruments such as wills, contracts, and promissory notes are writings that 
have independent legal significance and are not hearsay."" (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)). The court rejects 
plaintiffs' objection as utterly baseless. "
869,40," It's like a broken record. Plaintiffs assert an objection to defendants' Exhibit 224 based on inadmissible hearsay to which no 
exception applies. Doc. 2190-1 at 77. Yet, plaintiffs also don't dispute this statement of fact. Id. at 20; see also Doc. 2226-3 at 52 
(discussing ""SMF ¶ 156""). Defendants respond that this document qualifies as a business record that is admissible under Fed. 
R. Evid. 803(6)'s exception to the hearsay rule. Doc. 2226-1 at 21. The court agrees. As defendants have shown, this document, 
produced by Mylan, qualifies for admission as a business record under Fed. R. Evid. 803(6)'s exception to the hearsay rule. Doc. 
2226-1 at 21; see also Doc. 2227-1 at 11-12 (Cuthbertson Decl.). The court thus overrules this objection, yet another of plaintiffs' 
meritless and needless evidentiary objections. "
871,41," The court rejects plaintiffs' objection to defendants' Exhibit 32—as well as their objection to Exhibit 225 cited in the first 
sentence of the next paragraph—based on inadmissible hearsay to which no exception applies. Doc. 2190-1 at 77. Plaintiffs 
don't dispute these statements of fact. Id. at 20; see also Doc. 2226-3 at 52 (discussing ""SMF ¶¶ 156-157""). And, in any event, 
defendants correctly explain that these Mylan-produced documents qualify as business records that are admissible under Fed. 
R. Evid. 803(6)'s exception to the hearsay rule. Again, the court is perplexed by plaintiffs' purposeless objection tactics."
871,42," Plaintiffs object to defendants' Exhibits 226 and 227 as inadmissible hearsay to which no exception applies. Doc. 2190-1. But, 
plaintiffs also don't dispute the factual statements that the exhibits support. Id. at 20; see also Doc. 2226-3 at 52-53 (discussing 
""SMF ¶ 158""). Nevertheless, defendants correctly explain that these Sanofi-produced documents qualify as business records 
that are admissible under Fed. R. Evid. 803(6)'s exception to the hearsay rule. For the same reasons, the court rejects all of 
plaintiffs' other objections to Sanofi-produced documents as inadmissible hearsay because the Sanofi documents qualify as 
business records that fall outside the definition of hearsay under Fed. R. Evid. 803(6). Also, plaintiffs' objections fail the sincerity 
standard because plaintiffs themselves rely on Sanofi-produced business records as summary judgment evidence to support 
their own factual statements. See, e.g., Doc. 2190-1 at 34 (citing Doc. 2192-12 (Pls.' Ex. 63) (Sanofi-produced internal email)). "
872,43," The court rejects plaintiffs' objections to all of these third-party produced documents as inadmissible hearsay to which no 
exception applies. Doc. 2190-1 at 77 (objecting to defendants' Exhibits 235 through 243). Defendants assert that these 
documents—produced by PBMs—qualify as business records subject to Fed. R. Evid. 803(6)'s hearsay exception. Doc. 2226-1 
at 21. The court agrees and thus overrules plaintiffs' objections. "
873,44," Plaintiffs attempt to controvert the statement that Mylan never threatened to cut off supply by citing two Mylan documents. But 
neither document, even when construed in plaintiffs' favor, suggests that Mylan threatened to cut off supply of EpiPens. See 
Doc. 2192-17 at 2-3 (Pls.' Ex. 68) (listing as a ""talking point"" for a meeting with MedImpact that ""Mylan will terminate its current 
contract if MedImpact implements a step edit against EpiPen[,]"" meaning that Mylan will withdraw its current rebates if the PBM 
imposed a restriction on EpiPen but never saying anything about cutting off EpiPen supply (emphasis added)); Doc. 2192-18 at 
2 (Pls.' Ex. 69) (informing OptumRx that ""[i]f for some reason, [OptumRx/UnitedHealthcare] decides to exclude EpiPen in 2014, 
we will not pay any enhanced rebates in 2013[,]"" but never mentioning that Mylan would cut off EpiPen supply (emphasis 
added)). "
874,45," Sanofi offered 25% rebates to Presbyterian Health, Doc. 2160-15 at 3 (Defs.' Ex. 272), while Mylan offered 15.5% rebates, 
Doc. 2160-16 at 2 (Defs.' Ex. 273)."
874,46," A Kaiser Permanente witness testified that the company usually contracts for one drug and it solicits up-front discounts instead 
of rebates. Doc. 2159-2 at 3-4, 14-15 (Defs.' Ex. 244) (Shia (Kaiser) Dep. 82:14-83:3, 264:14-265:19). The witness further 
testified that when it chose to stay with EpiPen Auvi-Q launched because Mylan offered ""the better price."" Id. at 7-9 (Defs.' Ex. 
244) (Shia (Kaiser) Dep. 106:11-108:1)."
874,47," The percentages include base rebates, incremental rebates, and a 4% administrative fee. "
875,48," Plaintiffs try to controvert this fact by citing their own expert's opinion that Mylan's rebate agreements violate the discount 
attribution test. Doc. 2192-6 at 237-38, 247-50 (Pls.' Ex. 55) (Elhauge Reply Expert Report ¶¶ 402, 419-22). As Prof. Elhauge 
explains, the discount attribution test ""shows that [Mylan's rebate agreements] have the potential to force an equally efficient 
rival to exit the market."" Id. at 237-38 (¶ 402). And, applying that test to rebate agreements at issue here, he concludes that 
""many or most of Mylan's agreements did in fact fail the discount attribution test by resulting in below-cost incremental prices."" 
Id. But, as defendants correctly explain, Prof. Elhauge's analysis isn't evidence that Mylan sold an EpiPen device at a price 
below its production cost. "
876,49, Plaintiffs don't dispute this fact. Doc. 2190-1 at 20 (noting that defendants' SMF ¶ 179 is undisputed). 
878,50," As noted previously, see supra note 9, plaintiffs assert a blanket objection to documents that defendants cite as summary 
judgment evidence but which they didn't submit as exhibits to their summary judgment motion. Doc. 2190-1 at 76-77. The above-
cited Forbes article is one of the citations to which plaintiffs object. Id. at 77 n.439 (asserting that the court can't consider the 
citation in defendants' footnote 429). But, plaintiffs also don't dispute defendants' factual assertion that defendants support with 
the exhibit. See Doc. 2190-1 at 20 (noting that plaintiffs don't dispute defendants' SMF ¶ 188). So, the court includes the above-
recited fact because plaintiffs don't controvert it. "
879,51," Our court has held that ""HN18[

Although the Tenth Circuit hasn't addressed this question, our court has explained that this ""ruling is consistent with the rule

(11th Cir. 2000); then citing In re U.S. Dep't of Defense & U.S. EPA Final Rule, 817 F.3d 261, 272 (6th Cir. 2016)); see also AER

Section 1407 are governed by the clearly settled law of the transferee court's circuit.""). "
880,52," Although plaintiffs assert their antitrust claims under particular state laws, they ask the court to evaluate them ""under the same 
legal standards as Sherman Act Section One (Conspiracy)"" and ""Sherman Act Section Two (Monopolization)[.]"" Doc. 2169 at 43 
(Pretrial Order ¶¶ 4.b.3.-4.). Defendants agree for ""the purpose of summary judgment."" Doc. 2142-1 at 69 n.431. So, consistent 
with the parties' agreement, the court evaluates plaintiffs' antitrust claims on summary judgment under the legal standards that 
apply to the Sherman Act."

884,54," Defendants argue that plaintiffs' assertions about the Citizen Petition have no connection to the EpiPen settlement which, 
under plaintiffs' theory, produced the generic delay. Doc. 2142-1 at 74 n.438. So, defendants argue, the Citizen Petitions can't 
present a triable issue whether the settlement delayed generic entry. Id. But, defendants ignore that plaintiffs have alleged that 
defendants engaged in a ""scheme . . . to stifle all generic competition in the EAI market."" Doc. 2169 at 15 (Pretrial Order P 
3.a.1.b.). And, they allege that defendants' scheme included both (1) entering unlawful reverse payment settlements, and (2) 
""filing a baseless Citizen Petition and a supplement mere weeks before the entry date agreed upon in the settlement."" Id. at 15-
17 (Pretrial Order ¶ 3.a.1.b.). Also, plaintiffs assert their argument about the Citizen Petition in response to defendants' 
contention that the FDA's actions constitute an intervening and independent cause of the generic delay cutting off any causal 
connection between the EpiPen settlement and the delayed generic entry. As discussed in the above-section, plaintiffs present a 
triable issue whether the Citizen Petition delayed Teva's FDA approval. So, because a reasonable jury could find from the 
summary judgment facts that defendants' actions caused delay in the FDA's approval, the court can't find as a matter of law that 
the FDA's approval—which didn't come until 2018—was an independent and intervening cause of the generic delay. "
885,55," Defendants assert that, because the Citizen Petition's contents are undisputed, the question whether the Citizen Petition is 
objectively baseless is a question of law for the court to decide. Doc. 2226-1 at 26 & n.50. The court disagrees. HN29[
] The 
question ""[w]hether petitioning activity is a sham is generally [one] for the jury."" In re Suboxone (Buprenorphine Hydrochloride & 
Naloxone) Antitrust Litig., 64 F. Supp. 3d 665, 689 (E.D. Pa. 2014) (citing In re Flonase Antitrust Litig., 795 F. Supp. 2d 300, 310 
(E.D. Pa. 2011)); see also Catch Curve, Inc. v. Venali, Inc., 519 F. Supp. 2d 1028, 1037 (C.D. Cal. 2007) (""'[W]hether something 
is a genuine effort to influence governmental action, or a mere sham, is a question of fact.'"" (quoting Clipper Exxpress v. Rocky 
Mountain Motor Tariff Bureau, Inc., 690 F.2d 1240, 1253 (9th Cir. 1982)). A court can rule the objectively baseless question as a 
matter of law where ""there is no dispute over the predicate facts of the underlying . . . proceeding[.]"" Pro. Real Est. Invs., Inc., 
508 U.S. at 63. But, here, there is a dispute about the predicate facts of the underlying proceeding—namely, whether Mylan's 
Citizen Petition raised issues that the FDA already had received and rejected in other Citizen Petitions, whether it occupied the 
FDA's time thus delaying the approval process, and whether the timing of the filing in January 2015 supports a finding or 
inference that defendants submitted the Citizen Petition as a way to delay Teva's generic entry as the settlement's agreed-to 
entry date approached. The court can't make that determination as a matter of law on these facts. It's a jury question. "
892,56," Defendants respond to plaintiffs' citation to this summary judgment fact, arguing that it is a ""typo in an email subject line"" that 
is ""not evidence."" Doc. 2226-3 at 93. Assuming Mylan can adduce evidence to this effect, Mylan can argue that this email's 
subject line contains a simple typo. And a reasonable juror might accredit that inference. But, on this motion, the court must 
construe the evidence in plaintiffs' favor, and a reasonable trier of fact also might infer that it wasn't a typo and the author meant 
to refer to the two as one, single agreement that resolved both cases. The court must leave that determination to the jury. It's not 
a proper question for the court to resolve on summary judgment."
892,57," Defendants assert that Prof. Elhauge's opinion doesn't preclude summary judgment because expert opinion cannot create a 
triable issue of fact about the existence of a conspiracy. For support, defendants cite a case that prohibited experts from opining 
on the ""ultimate issue"" whether a conspiracy existed because experts may not testify about legal conclusions. See Hyland v. 
HomeServices of Am., Inc., 771 F.3d 310, 322 (6th Cir. 2014) (affirming trial court's decision precluding expert from testifying ""to 
their ultimate opinions that a price-fixing conspiracy existed""). And, they cite another case where the experts' opinions failed to 
support an inference of conspiracy because the opinions didn't exclude the possibility of independent action. See Dahl v. Bain 
Cap. Partners, LLC, 937 F. Supp. 2d 119, 137 n.17 (D. Mass. 2013) (holding that ""experts' ultimate conclusions do not provide 
a permissible inference under the controlling case law""). Those cases don't apply here. Prof. Elhauge isn't offering an expert opinion on the ultimate legal issue whether a conspiracy 
existed. Instead, he is offering his opinion, as an expert in antitrust economics, whether the EpiPen and Nuvigil settlements 
made economic sense for the parties. That kind of evidence is proper expert opinion which the jury can consider and weigh to 
determine whether it supports the existence of an antitrust conspiracy and excludes the possibility that the two settlements were 
independent actions. Also, defendants attack Prof. Elhauge's opinion because, they contend, his analysis shows that the Nuvigil settlement, standing 
alone, was profitable for Mylan. The court has addressed this argument comprehensively in its Order ruling defendants' Motion 
to Exclude Prof. Elhauge's expert opinions. As that Order explains, Prof. Elhauge provides a reliable basis for the opinions 
offered in his original Expert Report and Reply Report. And, any challenges that defendants assert against them go to the weight 
that the trier of fact should assign to those opinions. "
897,58," Tampa Electric decided a Clayton Act claim and concluded that the contract at issue didn't ""tend to foreclose a substantial 
volume of competition."" 365 U.S. at 335. After reaching that conclusion, the Court found it ""need not discuss the respondents' 
further contention that the contract also violates § 1 and § 2 of the Sherman Act, for if it does not fall within the broader 
proscription of § 3 of the Clayton Act it follows that it is not forbidden by those of the former."" Id. (citation omitted). HN40[
] 
Although Tampa Electric involved a Clayton Act claim, courts also apply its analysis to exclusive dealing claims asserted under 
the Sherman Act because each statute ""include[s] an anticompetitive conduct element, although each statute articulates that 
element in a slightly different way."" ZF Meritor, 696 F.3d at 269 n.9; see also id. at 327 n.26 (Greenberg, J., dissenting) (""In 
substance, the Tampa Electric standard for Clayton Act Section 3 claims differs very marginally, if at all, from the fact-intensive 
rule-of-reason analysis that applies to this case under Section 1 of the Sherman Act.""); Dos Santos v. Columbus-Cuneo-Cabrini 
Med. Ctr., 684 F.2d 1346, 1352 n.11 (7th Cir. 1982) (noting that Tampa Electric applies to Sherman Act cases even though it 
was decided under § 3 of the Clayton Act). "
898,59," The Tenth Circuit hasn't articulated a set of factors that a court should consider when analyzing an exclusive dealing 
arrangement, like the Third Circuit provided in  [**216] ZF Meritor. But, the ZF Meritor factors include the same factors that the 
Supreme Court's Tampa Electric opinion instructed courts to consider and that other Circuit courts have considered in their 
analysis of exclusive dealing contracts. The court predicts that the Tenth Circuit, if presented with this question, would apply the 
ZF Meritor factors to Mylan's rebate contracts to determine whether they substantially foreclose competition. Thus, the court 
applies those factors in its analysis here."
898,60," The five factors addressed by defendants' motion are Factors #2, #3, #5, #6, and #7 from ZF Meritor. The parties never 
address the remaining factors (#1 and #4) or how the summary judgment facts support or preclude a finding that the Mylan 
rebate contracts are unlawful exclusive dealing arrangements under these remaining factors. Several times, plaintiffs call Mylan 
a ""monopolist"" but never in the context of ZF Meritor's first factor—i.e., whether the defendant has significant market power. But, 
even if the summary judgment facts establish that Mylan had significant market power, this factor ""is not dispositive."" Eisai, Inc. 
v. Sanofi-Aventis U.S., LLC, No. 08-4168 (MLC), 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46791, 2014 WL 1343254, at *34 (D.N.J. Mar. 28, 2014) 
(concluding that Sanofi's ""significant market power"" which was ""81% to 92% during the relevant period"" was ""not dispositive"" of 
the question whether the contracts at issue were unlawful exclusive dealing arrangements). So, the court finds the two remaining 
factors neutral to its analysis whether a reasonable jury could find or infer an unlawful exclusive dealing arrangement under the 
summary judgment facts here. "
899,61," As discussed, supra note 44, plaintiffs' citations to two Mylan documents won't support a finding or inference that Mylan ever 
threatened to cut off EpiPen supply. Instead, the documents showed that Mylan threatened to withdraw discounts if payors 
restricted or excluded EpiPen—but not if payors refused to exclude Auvi-Q. See Doc. 2192-17 at 2-3 (Pls.' Ex. 68) (listing as a 
""talking point"" for a meeting with MedImpact that ""Mylan will terminate its current contract if MedImpact implements a step edit 
against EpiPen"" (emphasis added)); Doc. 2192-18 at 2 (Pls.' Ex. 69) (informing OptumRx that ""[i]f for some reason, 
[OptumRx/UnitedHealthcare] decides to exclude EpiPen in 2014, we will not pay any enhanced rebates in 2013"" but never 
mentioning that Mylan would cut off EpiPen supply (emphasis added))."
899,62," Plaintiffs also assert two arguments that PBMs had an incentive to agree to exclusivity restrictions in exchange for higher 
rebates. They base these arguments on (1) the collective effects that such agreements have on raising market-wide prices, thus 
producing greater profits for PBMs, and (2) the agreements' bundling of incontestable and contestable demand. Doc. 2190-1 at 
98-99. But these arguments don't assert that defendants engaged in any coercive behavior by offering rebates conditioned on "
900,," exclusivity. Instead, they simply assert incentives explaining why a PBM would agree to exclusivity in exchange for higher 
rebates. The court addresses plaintiffs' incontestable demand theory in greater detail when considering Factor #2 (substantial 
market foreclosure). But, these two arguments don't present a triable issue on the coercion factor. "
902,63," Plaintiffs also cite several Supreme Court cases purportedly ""condemn[ing] exclusionary agreements even if they are 
terminable."" Doc. 2190-1 at 100-01. But those cases just mention the contract terms in passing without significant analysis 
whether the terminability provisions produced an exclusionary effect, and the cases turned, instead, on other facts that produced 
a foreclosure of competition. See FTC v. Brown Shoe Co., 384 U.S. 316, 318-19, 86 S. Ct. 1501, 16 L. Ed. 2d 587 & n.2 (1966) 
(reciting a provision of the agreement that refused to grant certain benefits to shoe retailers who ""are dropped or voluntarily 
withdraw from the"" program but, in another part of the opinion, discussing the facts that supported the finding ""that the franchise 
program effectively foreclosed Brown's competitors from selling to a substantial number of retail shoe dealers""); see also 
Standard Oil Co. v. United States, 337 U.S. 293, 296, 314, 69 S. Ct. 1051, 93 L. Ed. 1371 (1949) (concluding that, although a 
requirements contract lasted only a year and was terminable with 30 days' notice, ""the affected proportion of retail sales of 
petroleum products is substantial"" and the contracts presented ""a potential clog on competition"" that ""would impede a substantial 
amount of competitive activity""). "
903,64," Plaintiffs assert that Mylan's rebate contracts didn't actually represent price competition because it's undisputed that EpiPen 
prices rose during the relevant time period. And, plaintiffs contend, Mylan's rebating practices caused the price increase because "
904,," it was the price increases that, in turn, allowed Mylan to offer higher rebates to payors. But this argument ignores summary 
judgment evidence showing that rebate contract negotiations consisted of more than negotiations over rebate percentages. They 
also included negotiations over contract terms governing WAC prices and price protection. See Doc. 2159-6 at 2 (Defs.' Ex. 248) 
(reporting that OptumRx asked whether Mylan was ""interested in a guaranteed exclusive position for EpiPen in exchange for the 
addition of 10% price protection""); see also Doc. 2159-7 at 3 (Defs.' Ex. 249) (warning to Mylan by OptumRx that ""EpiPen is at 
risk"" if it didn't offer price protection because the PBM was ""well aware of the price increases Mylan [had] taken""); Doc. 2193-1 at 
4 (Defs.' Ex. 82) (showing Sanofi's offer to ESI of a 60.625% rebate with 10% price protection for exclusivity). "
907,65," The parties do not cite and the court's own research has not located any case where the Tenth Circuit has considered whether 
the price-cost test applies to an exclusive dealing claim based on a discount or rebate program. The court predicts, if presented 
with the question, the Tenth Circuit would find ZF Meritor's reasoning persuasive and apply it to the facts presented here. "
908,66," At the district court level, however, the New Jersey federal court concluded ""that price was the predominant mechanism of 
exclusion"" of the market share discount contracts at issue, and ""thus, the price-cost"" test applied. Eisai Inc. v. Sanofi-Aventis 
U.S., LLC, No. 08-4168 (MLC), 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46791, 2014 WL 1343254, at *30 (D.N.J. Mar. 28, 2014) (citations and 
internal quotation marks omitted). The court explained that under the price-cost test, ""so long as the price is above-cost, the 
procompetitive justifications for, and the benefits of, lowering prices far outweigh any potential anticompetitive effects."" Id. 
(citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Because it was undisputed that defendant Sanofi never sold its drug below its 
costs to produce the product, the New Jersey district court held that plaintiff couldn't ""recover under the antitrust laws, and 
summary judgment must be granted in favor of Sanofi."" Id. The New Jersey court also applied a rule of reason analysis to the 
plaintiff's exclusive dealing claims and concluded the ""result would be the same."" Id.; see also 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46791, 
[WL] at *30-36."
908,67," These statute of limitations arguments are mooted by the courts' other conclusions about antitrust damages. As discussed, 
plaintiffs don't assert any damages claim based on their generic delay theory before March 14, 2014—the date when (according 
to plaintiffs' theory) Teva would have launched its generic EAI ""but for"" the alleged unlawful reverse payment settlement. And, 
the court dismisses plaintiffs' Tennessee state law claims because there is no properly named plaintiff who asserts claims under 
that state's laws. "
911,68," The dismissal of these other plaintiffs doesn't require the court to dismiss any pending claims. Other properly named plaintiffs 
assert the same claims that these plaintiffs have asserted. "
914,69," Plaintiffs correctly assert that this language comes from Hemi Group's plurality opinion. But, as the First Circuit has 
recognized, Hemi Group ""produced a 4-1-3 decision with no majority on the proximate cause question."" In re Neurontin Mktg. & 
Sales Pracs. Litig., 712 F.3d 21, 38 n.12 (1st Cir. 2013) (emphasis added). The Hemi Group plurality opinion's recitation of the 
""but for"" causation standard is consistent with other governing Supreme Court precedent. "
915,70," Plaintiffs also cite the court's Order granting in part the class certification motion, asserting that the court held ""the plaintiff 
need not be the victim of the predicate acts"" to prevail on a RICO claim. Doc. 2190-1 at 122 n.634. And, elsewhere, plaintiffs' 
Response asserts that the court's Order ruling the class certification motion explained ""how Plaintiffs had demonstrated RICO 
causation on each of the three schemes to defraud"" and made ""a number of legal rulings that apply to the legal issues at 
summary judgment."" Doc. 2190-1 at 120. The court disagrees with plaintiffs' application of the certification Order. As the court 
noted in that Order, the court was required to ""'accept the substantive allegations of the complaint as true'"" when determining 
""whether plaintiffs have met their burden of affirmatively demonstrating compliance with Rule 23's requirements[.]"" Doc. 2018-1 
at 5 n.2 (quoting Shook v. El Paso Cnty., 386 F.3d 963, 968 (10th Cir. 2004)). And, the court's Order never considered the merits 
of the ""but for"" causation requirement necessary to support plaintiffs' RICO claims. See generally id. But now, because the case 
has arrived at the summary judgment stop of its progress to trial, the court can't just accept plaintiffs' allegations as true. Instead, 
plaintiffs bear a summary judgment burden to come forward with admissible proof of a genuine factual question whether plaintiffs 
would have sustained any injury ""but for"" defendants' alleged RICO predicate acts. Plaintiffs haven't made that showing. "
916,71," Also, defendants note that no court ever has found a reverse payment settlement allegation sufficient to support a RICO claim. "
917,72," This theory also fails for other reasons the court already has addressed. Simply, the summary judgment facts don't present 
any triable issues whether Mylan's rebating practices unlawfully restrained competition. Thus, any alleged misrepresentations 
about Mylan's rebating practices didn't cause plaintiffs to sustain any damages. "
929,1," Plaintiffs do not clarify whether they intend to challenge the district court's first basis for concluding that the § 1 Sherman Act 
claim was not satisfied. As noted above, the district court's first reason was that plaintiffs' circumstantial evidence—for example, 
the enactment and enforcement of the towing licenses—did not raise a plausible inference that the City and Miller Compressing 
conspired to enact the City's regulatory scheme. However, plaintiffs do not develop any argument regarding that circumstantial 
evidence on appeal. Even if plaintiffs had raised and developed the argument that this regulatory conduct constituted an agreement, the 
circumstantial evidence would not have been dispositive to this appeal. We agree with the district court's well-supported view 
that the regulatory conduct here is insufficient circumstantial evidence to plead a plausible agreement for § 1 of the Sherman 
Act. In this case, plaintiffs' allegations did not ""tend[] to exclude the possibility' that the [City] acted independently"" of Miller 
Compressing to enact ordinances and regulate plaintiffs. See Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 
588, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). "
931,2," In passing, plaintiffs also refer to output limitations or market allocation as per se unlawful violations of § 1 of the Sherman Act. 
Even if those arguments were not waived, any agreement to allocate or restrain output is, again, the product of vertical 
agreement and therefore likely not presumptively unlawful under the Sherman Act. See, e.g., Cont'l T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania 
Inc., 433 U.S. 36, 59, 97 S. Ct. 2549, 53 L. Ed. 2d 568 (1977) (vertical nonprice restraints judged under rule of reason analysis). "

their school teams, in their social media posts, or otherwise, as a result of the NCAA rules they challenge here. "
942,4," Defendants argue that some of these statements were made in the context of their ""lobbying efforts regarding potential 
legislative action,"" and for that reason, Plaintiffs cannot ""impose antitrust liability on the NCAA"" based on these statements in 
light of the Noerr-Pennington doctrine, see Mot. at 6; see also Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, 
Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 81 S. Ct. 523, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464 (1961); United Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 85 S. Ct. 1585, 14 
L. Ed. 2d 626 (1965). HN5[
] Pursuant to the Noerr-Pennington doctrine, ""private actors are immune from antitrust liability for petitioning the government, even when the private actors' motives are anticompetitive."" Sanders v. Brown, 504 F.3d 903, 912 
(9th Cir. 2007) (citations omitted). Plaintiffs argue that the Noerr-Pennington doctrine does not preclude them from seeking to "
943,," use the statements as party admissions to show that Defendants agree that the amateur nature of college sports would not be 
altered if certain NIL rights are granted to student-athletes. The Court finds that Defendants have not shown that the Noerr-
Pennington doctrine precludes Plaintiffs from using the statements in question as party admissions to support their claims in this 
action, which arise from Defendants' alleged price-fixing by way of certain NCAA rules and not from Defendants' petitioning 
activities. Accordingly, the Noerr-Pennington doctrine does not preclude the Court from considering the statements in question 
as allegations of party admissions in the context of resolving the present motion to dismiss. "
947,5," In a footnote, Defendants argue in passing that Tymir Oliver's claims are barred by res judicata. HN13[
] Res judicata bars a 
subsequent claim when there is: (i) an identity of claims between the prior and subsequent actions; (ii) a final judgment on the 
merits; and (iii) identity or privity between the parties. Media Rights Techs., Inc. v. Microsoft Corp., 922 F.3d 1014, 1020-21 (9th 
Cir. 2019) (internal citation omitted). In light of the distinct factual allegations and legal theories upon which Tymir Oliver's claims 
are predicated, as discussed above, the Court cannot conclude at this juncture that there is an identity of claims between the 
claims he asserts here and those in Alston. Accordingly, the Court cannot conclude at this stage that Tymir Oliver's claims are 
barred by res judicata. "
958,1," Unless otherwise noted, all docket references herein refer to Civil Action No. 19-cv-00385 (the ""Lead Action""). "
959,2," Defendants Shin-Etsu Chemical Co. Ltd. and Formosa Plastics Corporation have individually filed renewed motions to dismiss 
for lack of personal jurisdiction (Dkt. 230; Dkt. 288), which the Court grants in a separate Decision and Order filed 
contemporaneously herewith. Accordingly, all claims asserted against these defendants are dismissed without prejudice, and 
this Decision and Order does not consider the merits of the claims asserted against them. "
960,3," In their reply papers, Defendants suggest that the Court should dismiss these withdrawn claims with prejudice. (Dkt. 202 at 12). 
The Court rejects this contention. HN3[
] Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(1)(A)(i), a plaintiff may voluntarily dismiss a claim without prejudice before an opposing party serves either an answer or a motion for summary judgment. While 
the Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs did not file a notice of dismissal as contemplated by Rule 41, they could have done so, and the 
Court finds no reason to punish the Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs for their attempt to narrow the dispute by entering a dismissal 
with prejudice of the claims they have voluntarily withdrawn with prejudice. "
972,4," As discussed above, the Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs have agreed to withdraw their consumer protection claims asserted under 
the laws of Arkansas, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, 
Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. (See Dkt. 195 
at 29 n. 12). While the dismissal of these claims is without prejudice, the Court's extension of the deadline for filing a motion for 
leave to amend does not apply to these claims. "
1044,1," MET has alleged with some precision that Under Armour ""is responsible for over 60% of sales in the market for CCREB in the 
United States[.]"" ECF 58, ¶ 20. The Court sees no reason why MET should not be able to specify the types of clothing it 
considered when calculating or estimating this number. If discovery reveals that other types of clothing belong in the CCREB 
market, MET can always seek leave to amend its complaint to include them."
1044,2," This does not mean MET needs to provide excessive detail about the products in the market. It only needs to clearly identify 
what categories of clothing the market contains, rather than obscuring the market by providing only examples of types of clothing 
the market ""includes."" "
1045,3," For this same reason, the Court is not convinced by Under Armour's apparent contention that, to satisfy the ""reasonable 
interchangeability"" requirement, the relevant market must be subdivided to account for every consumer trait, such as gender or 
age, or for all product traits, such as clothing types or sizes. See, e.g., ECF 72, pp. 7-8; ECF 65, p. 2. Instead, the pertinent 
question is whether the products in the market share the important traits that drive consumers to shop only within the alleged 
market, rather than considering products outside of it to be reasonable substitutes. See, e.g., Am. Needle, Inc., 385 F. Supp. 2d "
1046,," at 694; Dang v. San Francisco Forty Niners, 964 F. Supp. 2d 1097, 1107 (N.D. Cal. 2013) (concluding that plaintiff had 
adequately pled antitrust market consisting of all ""apparel"" bearing NFL-related logos, because ""a reason why the apparel 
products at issue may be deemed valuable and relevant to consumers is in their bearing of NFL-related logos and trademarks.""). "
1048,1," Tyler also brought claims against Jimmy Davis (""Davis"") and Joe Thornsberry (""Thornsberry""), who ""both were active Tyler 
employees"" until July 2020. (Filing No. 1 at 1-3, 6, 26-33.) These claims, however, have since been dismissed with prejudice by 
stipulation (see Filing No. 63 (dismissing claims against Thornsberry); Filing No. 67 (dismissing claims against Davis))."
1048,2," Though Lexur and Fry moved to dismiss the claims against them independently, because Fry adopted Lexur's lead and reply 
arguments in their entirety (see Filing No. 32; Filing No. 65), the Court will refer to the arguments made in Lexur's briefing as 
""Defendants'"". For its part, Tyler responded with an ""omnibus Opposition"" brief (see Filing No. 58)."
1048,3," The Complaint also alleges that various ""other individuals or entities encouraged, assisted, or supported Defendants in their 
anti-competitive scheme to restrict bidding on public works contracts and to tortiously interfere with Tyler's contractual and 
business relationships."" (Filing No. 1 at 7.) The Complaint, however, fails to outline the involvement of these John Doe 
Defendants in any meaningful way. Defendants suggest that these John Does ""are not parties unknown to Tyler""; instead, ""they 
are the counties themselves and certain unnamed county employees."" (Filing No. 30 at 2 n.1.) Defendants opine that Tyler does 
not want to, however, ""put itself in the awkward position of naming its own customers as Defendants."" Id. The Court will not 
speculate as to these unnamed defendants' identities. "
1049,4," Tyler asserts in its response brief that ""[e]very single one of the Counties targeted by the Defendants has ultimately 
reconsidered the path,"" either reopening the bidding process or declining or rescinding a contract with Lexur (Filing No. 58 at 5). 
The Court, however, will not consider these facts when ruling on this Motion to Dismiss. See Car Carriers, Inc. v. Ford Motor 
Co., 745 F.2d 1101, 1107 (7th Cir. 1984) (noting that ""it is axiomatic that the complaint may not be amended by the briefs in 
opposition to a motion to dismiss"" and that ""consideration of a motion to dismiss is limited to the pleadings"") (citations omitted). "
1051,5," See also ""Bid Rigging,"" AN FTC GUIDE TO ANTITRUST LAWS, https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/competition-guidance/guide-antitrust-
laws/dealings-competitors/bid-rigging (last visited May 27, 2021) (""Bid rigging can take many forms, but one frequent form is 
when competitors agree in advance which firm will win the bid. For instance, competitors may agree to take turns being the low 
bidder, or sit out of a bidding round, or provide unacceptable bids to cover up a bid-rigging scheme. Other bid-rigging 
agreements involve subcontracting part of the main contract to the losing bidders, or forming a joint venture to submit a single 
bid.""). "
1054,6," Notably, the Winkler court eschewed endorsing the statement from the affirmed Court of Appeals decision that ""[t]o satisfy this 
element of the tort, the breach must be malicious and exclusively directed to the injury and damage of another."" Winkler v. V.G. 
Reed & Sons, Inc., 619 N.E.2d 597, 600 (Ind. Ct. App. 1993), aff'd, 638 N.E.2d 1228 (Ind. 1994). "
1056,7," ""When a complaint fails to state a claim, the plaintiff ordinarily should receive at least one opportunity to amend it, unless an 
amendment would be futile."" Olrich v. Kenosha Cty., 825 F. App'x 397, 400 (7th Cir. 2020) (citing Runnion ex rel. Runnion v. Girl 
Scouts of Greater Chi. & Nw. Ind., 786 F.3d 510, 520 (7th Cir. 2015)). "
1062,1," The Brand Manufacturer Defendants include Defendants Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (""BI""); Chattem, Inc., 
Sanofi US Services Inc., and Sanofi-Aventis U.S. LLC (collectively, ""Sanofi""); Pfizer Inc. (""Pfizer""); and GlaxoSmithKline LLC 
(""GSK""). "
1063,2," A court must accept a plaintiff's factual allegations as true at the motion-to-dismiss stage. West v. Warden, 869 F.3d 1289, 
1296 (11th Cir. 2017) (""When considering a motion to dismiss, we accept as true the facts as set forth in the complaint and draw 
all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff's favor."") (quotation marks omitted). Plaintiffs have set forth their factual allegations in 
three ""master"" complaints: the Amended Master Personal Injury Complaint (""AMPIC""); the Consolidated Amended Consumer 
Economic Loss Class Action Complaint; and the Consolidated Medical Monitoring Class Action Complaint (""MMC"") (collectively, 
the ""Master Complaints""). DE 2759, 2835, 2832-1. Unless otherwise noted, all citations will be made to the redacted versions of 
the Master Complaints. "
1065,3," Unless noted otherwise, all page number references herein are to the page numbers generated by CM/ECF in the header of 
each document. "
1094,1," This Court has already stressed the difference between disgorgement—which the Ninth Circuit considered in In re Facebook, 
Inc. Internet Tracking Litigation—and restitution—which Plaintiffs seek here: ""'Disgorgement' is a broader remedy than restitution"" in that disgorgement ""has been used to refer to surrender of all profits 
earned as a result of an unfair business practice regardless of whether those profits represent money taken directly from 
persons who were victims of the unfair practice."" [Korea Supply Co., 29 Cal. 4th] at 1145 (emphasis in original). By 
contrast, restitution under the UCL must ""restore the status quo"" by ""returning to the plaintiff"" funds taken from him or 
""benefits in which the plaintiff has an ownership interest."" Id. at 1148-49. Put another way, restitutionary [**58]  
disgorgement ""focuses on the plaintiff's loss, and nonrestitutionary disgorgement ""focuses on the defendant's unjust 
enrichment."" Meister v. Mensinger, 230 Cal. App. 4th 381, 398, 178 Cal. Rptr. 3d 604 (2014). Although the defendant's 
benefit and the plaintiff's loss are often the same, nonrestitutionary disgorgement may also be had ""where a benefit has "
1095,," been received by the defendant but the plaintiff has not suffered a corresponding loss."" Id. (internal quotations and 
alterations omitted). Order on Motion to Dismiss at 46."
1095,2," This provision states: An operator of a commercial Web site or online service that collects personally identifiable information through the Web site 
or online service from individual consumers who use or visit the commercial Web site or online service and who reside in 
California shall be in violation of this section if the operator fails to comply with the provisions of Section 22575 or with the 
provisions of its posted privacy policy in either of the following ways: (a) Knowingly and willfully. (b) Negligently and materially. Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 22576. Plaintiffs allege that Defendants violate this provision by virtue of its breach of contract, as 
alleged in Count 6. See 3AC ¶¶ 241, 258. "
1097,3," In the instant motion, Defendants insist that they previously moved to dismiss this claim. Mot. at 24. A review of Google's prior 
briefing reveals that Google did, indeed, move to dismiss Plaintiffs' declaratory judgment claim—in a single footnote buried at the 
end of twenty-five page brief. This Court's Standing Orders are clear that ""[f]ootnotes shall not be used to cite to legal authorities 
or evidence."" Standing Order for Civil Cases IV.F. The Court assumed that it did not need to caution parties not to raise 
dispositive arguments in footnotes. See Estate of Saunders v. Comm'r, 745 F.3d 953, 962 fn. 8 (9th Cir. 2014) (""HN25[
] Arguments raised only in footnotes, or only on reply, are generally deemed waived""); Khoja v. Orexigen Therapeutics, Inc., 498 
F. Supp. 3d 1296, 1309 fn. 4 (S.D. Cal. 2020); Cheever v. Huawei Device USA, Inc., No. 18-CV-06715-JST, 2019 U.S. Dist.

1109,1, https://www.designnews.com/automotive/classic-mustang-ads-take-us-back-dawn-pony-car-era/gallery?slide=5 
1112,2," Notably, this claim is NOT about Limp Mode occurring while Plaintiffs drove their cars on the track or in more aggressive ways. "
1117,3, Ford heavily disputes this and points to Cruz's testimony that he experienced Limp Mode in 2016.
1117,4," The Ninth Circuit has also distinguished claim accrual from the statute of limitations. Goldstein v. Stahl (In re Goldstein), 526 
B.R. 13, 21-22 (B.A.P. 9th Cir. 2015) (""It is important, however, to distinguish principles of accrual from principles of discovery 
and tolling, which may cause the statute of limitations to begin to run after accrual has occurred for purposes of ownership in a 
bankruptcy proceeding."") (internal citation omitted). "
1120,5," In some cases where the Court found unique defenses defeated adequate representation, the defenses were unrelated to the 
merits of the case. See, e.g., Kline v. Wolf, 88 F.R.D. 696, 699-700 (S.D.N.Y.1981) (finding that named plaintiff's claim was 
atypical because of a credibility problem). "
1122,6," Plaintiffs cite Ford's expert Dr. Nauhaus for the statistic that 70% of ""performance enthusiasts"" at the time of purchase intended 
to use their vehicle for road course track days "
1127,7, Plaintiffs do not seek an express warranty class.
1127,8," In its class certification briefing, Defendant appears to concede that Missouri does not require a plaintiff to prove notice of 
breach. But in the preceding sentence, Defendant cites the Missouri statute that reads ""the buyer must within a reasonable time 
after he discovers or should have discovered any breach notify the seller of breach or be barred from any remedy."" Mo. Rev. 
Stat. § 400.2-607(3)(a). Yet, the Defendant sought summary judgment against a Missouri Plaintiff's warranty claims for failure to 
give notice of breach. The Court will follow Missouri law. "
1130,1," Dr. Youssef submits the declaration of his counsel, Yee Lam (""Lam"") to demonstrate compliance with statutory meet and confer 
requirements. Lam attests that on March 4, 2021, her office sent Plaintiffs' counsel a meet and confer letter regarding the 
arguments raised in the instant demurrer and motion to strike. (Lam Decl. ¶ 2, Exh. A.) On March 9, 2021, Plaintiffs' counsel 
responded by agreeing to withdraw the FAC's prayer for punitive damages but otherwise stated that the FAC was sufficiently 
pled. (Lam Decl. ¶ 3, Exh. B.) The Lam Declaration is sufficient for purposes of Code of Civil Procedure sections 430.41 and 
435.5. "
1136,1," Plaintiffs alleged a claim of fraudulent concealment against Columbia but withdrew this claim in response to Columbia's 
summary judgment motion. "
1137,2," Columbia separately moves to exclude the testimony and opinions of James Tupitza, a real estate attorney proffered by 
Plaintiffs to testify regarding customs and practices in pipeline condemnation and construction litigation. Tupitza has authored an 
eight-page report responding to four hypothetical questions posed by Plaintiffs' counsel. Most of his opinions involve matters—
specifically, the release executed by Plaintiffs in conjunction with the 2014 Amendment and Plaintiffs' breach of fiduciary duty 
claim—which, even if they were appropriate matters for expert opinion, will not be relevant at trial given the Court's disposition of 
these issues in the present opinion. It is thus unclear whether and to what extent Plaintiffs will continue to proffer Tupitza as an 
expert witness moving forward. Given that the substance of Tupitza's opinions is not relevant to the Court's disposition of its 
summary judgment motion, Columbia's Daubert challenge will be denied without prejudice to raise again should Plaintiffs seek to 
put Tupitza on the stand at trial. "
1139,3," Columbia requests a Daubert hearing. Courts have discretion to grant or deny such requests. Padillas, 186 F.3d at 418 (the 
decision to hold a Daubert hearing ""rests in the sound discretion of the district court""). In this case, because the full record on 
this issue is presently before the Court, including Ingram's several reports and deposition testimony, a Daubert hearing is 
unnecessary. See Oddi v. Ford Motor Co., 234 F.3d 136, 154 (3d Cir. 2000) (Daubert hearing properly denied where district 
court ""already had before it the depositions and affidavits of the plaintiff's experts""). "
1141,4," Plaintiffs also spend much time pressing use of the continuing trespass doctrine. When a party alleges a continuing trespass, it 
is permitted to recover for damages incurred in the two-year statutory period preceding the suit, even if the original trespass 
upon which the action is based occurred outside the limitations period. Kowalski v. TOA PA V, L.P., 2019 PA Super 93, 206 A.3d 
1148, 1167-68 (Pa. Super. 2019). This Court previously held in Plaintiffs' favor on this issue, finding that Plaintiffs alleged a 
continuing trespass. See Marcum v. Columbia Gas Transmission, LLC, 423 F. Supp.3d 115, 127 (E.D. Pa. 2019). It is unclear 
why Plaintiffs raise the doctrine again here, given that Columbia's moving brief does not raise the issue and, indeed, only 
questions Plaintiffs' ability to recover damages sustained prior to April 5, 2016—the same date from which Plaintiffs could 
recover damages pursuant to the continuing trespass doctrine. See Kowalski, 206 A.3d at 1167; Marcum, 423 F. Supp.3d at 127 
(""Plaintiffs thus can potentially recover for damages in the two-year statutory period preceding the suit.""). In its reply brief, 
Columbia asserts that the continuing trespass doctrine does not apply and further argues that ""all of Plaintiffs' claims for 
damages in this matter should be dismissed as time-barred."" Courts need not address arguments raised for the first time in a 
reply brief. See Gucciardi v. Bonide Prods., Inc., 28 F. Supp.3d 383, 393 (E.D. Pa. 2014) (""Where a reply brief raises new 
arguments in support of a motion for summary judgment, the district court is justified in disregarding them.""). Columbia's moving 
brief only questions Plaintiffs' ability to ""recover[] for damages sustained prior to April 5, 2016,"" and this is the only timeliness 
argument that will be considered. "
1147,5," Columbia takes issue with the inability of Plaintiffs' expert to state with certainty whether the sinkhole which began to develop 
on Plaintiffs' property in February 2018 was due to the presence of soluble limestone in the sinkhole area or Columbia's reliance 
on poor backfilling methods when constructing the 1278 line. Columbia may seek to explore this issue during cross-examination, 
see Kannankeril, 128 F.3d at 806, but it is not dispositive to the present motion. Plaintiffs' primary contention is that this and their 
other water-related injuries were caused by enhanced stormwater runoff, which in turn was caused by Columbia's ongoing 
failure to install adequate stormwater controls. "
1156,1," CAR T cells, or CARs, are chimeric antigen receptor T cells. CAR T cells are a potential cancer treatment."
1156,2," Anti-CEA CAR T cells target the carcinoembryonic antigen (""CEA"") on tumor cells. "
1159,3," The court additionally held that the Copyright Act preempted Siegler's state-law cause of action. Siegler V, 2019 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 129755, 2019 WL 3532294, at *12. "
1160,4," Some district courts schedule a date on which the mandate is ""spread"" and the federal appellate judgment becomes final. See 
Calderon v. U.S. Dist. Ct., 128 F.3d 1283, 1286 n.2 (9th Cir. 1997), overruled on other grounds by 163 F.3d 530 (9th Cir. 1998) 
(en banc). "
1161,5," HN3[
] Circuit courts may establish a bankruptcy appellate panel composed of bankruptcy judges to hear and determine certain appeals from bankruptcy courts. See 28 U.S.C. § 158(a), (b)(1), (c)(1). The decisions of the bankruptcy appellate panel 
may be appealed to the circuit courts. See id. at § 158(c)(2), (d)(1). "
1162,6," To the extent Siegler argues that the district court did not construe her pleadings liberally, we disagree. See, e.g., Siegler II, 
2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 23779, 2019 WL 581719, at *8, *13; Siegler V, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 129755, 2019 WL 3532294, at *18 
n.13. "
1163,7," Siegler's arguments about her takings claim include two tables purporting to show the substantial similarity between Siegler's 
copyrights and the defendants' patent applications. Appellant's Br. 12-15. HN10[
] But, as the district court explained, the 
copyright laws do not protect concepts or ideas in copyrighted works. See Siegler V, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 129755, 2019 
3532294, at *10. Siegler makes no arguments on appeal that the defendants' patent applications are substantially similar to her 
expression."
1163,8," Siegler appears to argue that her procedural due process rights were violated by the appellees and the district court, both of 
whom, she alleges, deprived her of her interest in her two copyrights. See Appellant's Br. 15-16. Her assertion against the 
appellees fails because they are not government actors. See Siegler V, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 129755, 2019 WL 3532294, at 
*22 & n.18 (citing Geneva Towers Tenants Org. v. Federated Mortg. Investors, 504 F.2d 483, 487 (9th Cir. 1974)). We see no 
basis to her assertion against the district court, which patiently explained its rulings and painstakingly afforded Siegler an 
opportunity to present her arguments in writing. "
1164,9," Rule 17(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides two exceptions. Siegler does not argue that these exceptions 
apply, nor do we see their relevance here."
1164,10, We are bound by the facts before us and decline to consider the implications of the hypothetical where SES is a corporation. 
1166,11," Even if the Board were a separate entity from the corporation it serves, we would view the district court's denial of Siegler's 
motion as setting aside the Board's default. See Hughes, 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 22121, 1988 WL 60164, at *2 (""[T]he district 
court denied Hughes' motion for a default judgment. We find that in so doing, the court implicitly set aside the default.""). There is 
good cause to set aside the default here because the Board disputed whether it had the capacity to be sued. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 
55(c). "
1167,12," Siegler contends that Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 92 S. Ct. 594, 30 L. Ed. 2d 652 (1972), confers on litigants a right to 
offer proof to support a complaint. Appellant's Br. 11. Not so. The Court instead determined that the plaintiff's complaint survived 
a Rule 12(b)(6) motion and that the case could proceed to discovery: the plaintiff's allegations were ""sufficient to call for the 
opportunity to offer supporting evidence."" Haines, 404 U.S. at 519-20. "
1168,13," HN27[
] Rule 78 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure permit courts ""by rule or order"" to ""provide for submitting and determining motions on briefs, without oral hearings."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 78(b). Siegler may disagree with the Southern District of 
California's decision to permit rulings on motions without oral argument, but we see no basis for overturning that decision. "
1174,*," Judge Gerald Bard Tjoflat took senior status on November 19, 2019 and elected to participate in this decision pursuant to 28 
U.S.C. § 46(c)(2). "
1175,1," The district court ruled that SmileDirect's Sherman Act claim, as pled, was ""sufficient to survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to 
dismiss on Parker immunity grounds."" D.E. 51 at 13. Like the panel, we conclude that the district court's denial of the Parker 
defense was conclusive at this stage of the litigation. See SmileDirectClub, 969 F.3d at 1138 n.4. The district court did not 
definitively reject the Parker defense because the facts as pled might not be the facts at summary judgment or trial. But this does 
not mean that the district court's Rule 12(b)(6) ruling was tentative. Cf. Behrens v. Pelletier, 516 U.S. 299, 309, 116 S. Ct. 834, 
133 L. Ed. 2d 773 (1996) (explaining that a motion to dismiss on qualified immunity grounds takes the defendant's conduct as 
alleged in the complaint, while a motion for summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds considers the evidence in the light 
most favorable to the plaintiff). "
1176,2," As explained later, we conclude that the Board members cannot meet the third condition of effective unreviewability, and 
therefore do not discuss the first and second conditions."
1176,3," We later extended the jurisdictional ruling in Commuter Transportation Systems to private parties, but without explaining why 
they too are entitled to an immediate appeal when their Parker arguments are rejected before trial. See Praxair, 64 F.3d at 611. 
As things stand, we are the only circuit to allow private parties like the Board members to take an interlocutory appeal from the 
denial of a Parker-based motion to dismiss or motion for summary judgment. The other circuits to address the issue have held 
that private parties cannot use the collateral order doctrine to appeal a non-final order rejecting the application of Parker. See 
Auraria Student Hous. v. Campus Village Apartments, LLC, 703 F.3d 1147, 1151 (10th Cir. 2013); Acoustic Sys., Inc. v. Wenger "
1177,," Corp., 207 F.3d 287, 292-94 (5th Cir. 2000); We, Inc. v. City of Philadelphia, 174 F.3d 322, 329 (3d Cir. 1999); Segni v. Com. 
Off. of Spain, 816 F.2d 344, 346 (7th Cir. 1987). "
1178,4," We acknowledge that some of the earlier Supreme Court cases applying the collateral order doctrine permitted appeals in 
scenarios not involving a claimed immunity from suit. See, e.g., Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U.S. 156, 170-72, 94 S. Ct. 
2140, 40 L. Ed. 2d 732 (1974) (imposition of notice costs in a class action); Swift & Co. Packers v. Compania Colombiana del 
Caribe, 339 U.S. 684, 688-89, 70 S. Ct. 861, 94 L. Ed. 1206 (1950) (attachment of a vessel in an admiralty proceeding). Those 
cases, however, are too far removed from the Parker defense asserted here to be of much help. We are also wary of applying 
those cases beyond their particular facts given the Supreme Court's comment that ""the collateral[ ]order doctrine may have 
expanded beyond the limits dictated by its internal logic and the strict application of the criteria set out in Cohen."" Ashcroft v. 
Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 672, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009). "
1180,5," We decided Commuter Transportation Systems in 1986, four years before Congress amended 28 U.S.C. § 2072(c), a provision 
of the Rules Enabling Act, to authorize the Supreme Court to adopt more nuanced finality requirements through rulemaking. See 
Mohawk Indus., 558 U.S. at 113-14. "
1182,1," Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S. 341, 63 S. Ct. 307, 87 L. Ed. 315 (1943) "
1183,2," Cohen's three prongs are: ""[1] the order must conclusively determine the disputed question, [2] resolve an important issue 
completely separate from the merits of the action, and [3] be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment."" Coopers, 
437 U.S. at 468, 98 S. Ct. at 2458 (citation omitted). "
1184,3," If qualified immunity is raised at the motion-to-dismiss stage, the defendant's claim is conclusively denied once the court 
subjects him to discovery. Behrens v. Pelletier, 516 U.S. 299, 308, 116 S. Ct. 834, 839-40, 133 L. Ed. 2d 773 (1996). If it's raised 
at summary judgment, it's denied when the case proceeds to trial. Mitchell, 472 U.S. at 527, 105 S. Ct. at 2816."
1184,4," ""Pendent jurisdiction is properly exercised over nonappealable decisions of the district court when the reviewing court already 
has jurisdiction over one issue in the case."" Stewart v. Baldwin Cty. Bd. of Educ., 908 F.2d 1499, 1509 (11th Cir. 1990) (citation 
omitted). The individual defendants in Swint were denied qualified immunity, which we recognized supplied a basis for our 
appellate jurisdiction under Mitchell, 472 U.S. at 530, 105 S. Ct. at 2817-18. Swint v. City of Wadley, Ala., 5 F.3d 1435, 1448-49 
(11th Cir. 1993). We thus exercised our pendent jurisdiction over the county's appeal in the interest of ""judicial economy."" Id. at 
1449-50. "
1185,5," Even in cases where Cohen's first prong is satisfied—for instance where the court determinatively rejects a defense in a bench 
trial under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(c)—Cohen's other two prongs may still prevent immediate review. Findings of fact 
underlying the court's ruling, for example, are likely to flunk the requirement that the issue reviewed be separate from the merits. 
See Johnson v Jones, 515 U.S. 304, 314-15, 115 S. Ct. 2151, 2157, 132 L. Ed. 2d 238 (1995). And mere defenses from liability 
are unlikely to be considered ""effectively unreviewable"" as part of a final judgment. In Swint, for instance, the Court went on to 
hold that Monell was a mere defense to liability and that ""[a]n erroneous ruling on liability may be reviewed effectively on appeal 
from final judgment."" 514 U.S. at 43, 115 S. Ct. at 1208."
1185,6," See 28 U.S.C. § 2680(j) (preserving immunity from ""[a]ny claim arising out of the combatant activities of the military or naval 
forces, or the Coast Guard, during time of war"")."
1185,7," Section 1292(b) provides: When a district judge, in making in a civil action an order not otherwise appealable under this section, shall be of the 
opinion that such order involves a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of 
opinion and that an immediate appeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation, he 
shall so state in writing in such order. The Court of Appeals which would have jurisdiction of an appeal of such action may 
thereupon, in its discretion, permit an appeal to be taken from such order, if application is made to it within ten days after 
the entry of the order: Provided, however, That application for an appeal hereunder shall not stay proceedings [**34]  in the 
district court unless the district judge or the Court of Appeals or a judge thereof shall so order. "
1186,8," See Metex Corp. v. ACS Industries, Inc., 748 F.2d 150, 153-54 (3d Cir. 1984), for another instance where the Third Circuit 
found Cohen's ""determinative ruling"" requirement unsatisfied due to the provisional nature of a summary judgment denial."
1186,9," The Supreme Court held in Feres v. United States, 340 U.S. 135, 146, 71 S. Ct. 153, 159, 95 L. Ed. 152 (1950), that ""the 
Government is not liable under the Federal Tort Claims Act for injuries to servicemen where the injuries arise out of or are in the 
course of activity incident to service."""
1186,10," Although the government pressed the argument, the Supreme Court did not reach the question whether the Feres doctrine 
provided an immunity from suit or whether it instead provided a mere defense to liability. In re Agent Orange, 745 F.2d at 164. 
The Court thought it didn't need to reach the question because it interpreted the District Court's order as leaving ""open the 
distinct possibility of dismissal before the case is heard"" so that ""the occurrence of a trial is no certainty."" Id.; but see Behrens, 
516 U.S. at 308, 116 S. Ct. at 839 (""Harlow and Mitchell make clear that [qualified immunity] is meant to give government 
officials a right, not merely to avoid standing trial, but also to avoid the burdens of such pretrial matters as discovery."" (citation 
and quotation marks omitted) (emphasis in original)."
1186,11," The Fourth Circuit did find that the District Court's post-hearing ruling was immediately appealable under Cohen because ""it 
finally and conclusively denied a claim of absolute immunity."" Jamison, 14 F.3d at 234. "
1201,1," The RJN requests that the Court to take judicial notice of copies of registration information from the U.S. Copyright Office's 
Online Catalog regarding the seven albums. See Doc. No. 29. The Court takes judicial notice of these governmental records. 
See Fed. R. Evid. 201; Basile v. Twneitieth Century Fox Film Corp., 678 F. App'x 576, 577 (9th Cir. 2017); Sybersound Records, 
Inc. v. UAV Corp., 517 F.3d 1137, 1146 (9th Cir. 2008); Yellowcake, Inc. v. Morena Music, Inc., 522 F. Supp. 3d 747, 2021 U.S.

Obodai v. YouTube LLC, 840 F.Supp.2d 714, 715 n.1 (S.D. N.Y. 2011). "
1209,2," ""DMCA"" refers to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, and the takedown procedures of the  are found at 17 U.S.C. § 512(c). 
See Vernor v. Autodesk, Inc., 621 F.3d 1102, 1105 & n.3 (9th Cir. 2010)."
1209,3," The FAC lists the copyrights in the cover art for three albums that are at issue. See FAC Ex. B. However, the Court was unable 
to locate these registrations on the Copyright Office website. In the absence of any challenges by YCH, the Court will assume 
that Hyphy has simply made typographical errors while attempting to convey the cover art registration numbers. Nevertheless, 
Hyphy is expected to review the registration information provided and make appropriate corrections in any amended 
counterclaims. If Hyphy has no registrations in the cover art, then Hyphy must correct the FAC by dropping all allegations of 
registered cover art. Pursuing infringement claims based on non-existent registrations (as opposed to incorrectly entered 
existing registration numbers) is sanctionable. "
1211,4," YCH's motion did not argue that the IICR cause of action was not plausibly pled. However, the pleading deficiency identified in 
this section necessarily follows from the Court's analysis of the first cause of action. Because a failure to state a claim can be 
raised even at trial, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(2), and because the deficiency is fatal to part of the IICR cause of action, the Court 
addresses the matter sua sponte at this time. See Omar v. Sea Land Service, Inc., 813 F.2d 986, 991 (9th Cir. 1987)."
1211,5," YCH did not move to dismiss the second cause of action for copyright infringement based on the three albums' cover art. 
Therefore, the analysis in this section and ultimate dismissal does not apply to issues surrounding the cover art. "
1213,6," For any cause of action, not just the IIPEA claim, if prior paragraphs are intended to support that cause of action, then Hyphy 
should incorporate by reference only those specific paragraphs, e.g. ""paragraphs 14 through 17, 27, 38 and 42 are hereby 
incorporates by reference."" The wholesale incorporation by reference of all prior paragraphs, when not all prior paragraphs are 
relevant and intended to support a cause of action, is improper. Weiland, 792 F.3d at 1321-23; Deerpoint Grp., 345 F.Supp.3d at 
1234 n.14."
1213,7," Like the IICR claim, YCH's motion did not argue that the UCL cause of action was not plausibly pled. However, the pleading 
deficiency identified in this section necessarily follows from the Court's analysis of the first cause of action and the IICR claim. 
Because the deficiency is fatal to part of the UCL claim, the Court addresses the matter sua sponte at this time. See Omar, 813 
F.2d at 991. "
1214,8," Because YCH does not address any issues surrounding the cover art, the analysis of this subsection is limited to actions 
involving the three albums. "
1217,9," Relatedly, while the submissions at this time suggest knowledge by Hyphy, the issue of knowledge has not been litigated or 
decided. "
1218,10," To be clear, Hyphy is free to request a preliminary injunction under the Copyright Act either in its Prayer for Relief or as part of 
the allegations under a copyright infringement cause of action. "
1239,1," In Walker Process Equipment v. Food Machine & Chemical Corp., 382 U.S. 172, 86 S. Ct. 347, 15 L. Ed. 2d 247 (1965), the 
Supreme Court held that a plaintiff could sue under § 2 of the Sherman Act based on the alleged maintenance and enforcement 
of a fraudulently obtained patent. "
1240,2," Ni-Q alleges a few facts relating to the reissue of the '921 Patent that may have occurred after the filing of the Third Amended 
Complaint (those facts do not have specific dates, but given the timing of the reissue patent prosecution, the alleged conduct is 
likely to have occurred after October 2019). The core of Ni-Q's proposed inequitable conduct claim, however, is that Prolacta 
engaged in inequitable conduct in originally prosecuting the '921 Patent, which occurred well before the filing of the Third 
Amended Complaint. Indeed, Ni-Q included most of the same allegations in its inequitable conduct affirmative defense to 
Prolacta's counterclaim. "
1241,3," Ni-Q also cites Advanced Magnetic Closures, Inc. v. Rome Fastener Corp., 607 F.3d 817 (Fed. Cir. 2010). Like in Monsanto, 
the jurisdiction for the court in Advanced Magnetic to make findings on inequitable conduct and unenforceability on a patent not 
in suit stemmed from the presence of a filed motion under § 285. Id. at 827 (""This court has held that a district court retains 
jurisdiction to consider a motion for attorney's fees under 35 U.S.C. § 285 and to make findings of inequitable conduct—even 
after a party has dismissed its counterclaims as to that patent.""). "
1242,4," Fact discovery closed on July 31, 2020. Ni-Q disclosed its new asserted relevant market to Prolacta on August 27, 2020, 
through Supplemental Interrogatory responses. Ni-Q filed its motion for summary judgment on its antitrust claim on September 
18, 2020. "
1244,5," Consumers also may have reasonable alternatives to Prolacta's products from formula based on cow's milk, although there is a 
stronger argument that those alternatives could be considered part of a separate product market. "
1253,1, The factual background in this section is drawn from Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint. 
1255,2," Defendant contends, for the first time on reply, that Plaintiffs have failed to allege an inadequate remedy at law under Sonner 
v. Premier Nutrition Corp., 971 F.3d 834, 944 (9th Cir. 2020). ECF No. 26 n.3. Because Defendant raised this issue for the 
first time on reply, the Court need not consider it. Zamani v. Carnes, 491 F.3d 990, 997 (9th Cir. 2007)."
1255,3," Plaintiffs filed an ex parte application to file a sur-reply on this issue, noting that Plaintiffs agreed that they would not oppose 
any request by Defendant to file a sur-sur reply. See ECF No. 28. Because the Court easily concludes that TransUnion does not 
affect the standing analysis in this case, the Court sees no need to have the parties engage in further briefing. Accordingly, the 
Court DENIES AS MOOT Plaintiffs' ex parte application. "
1256,4," Defendant also argues at length that Plaintiffs do not have standing to enforce the FDCA. E.g., ECF No. 26 at 9-12. However, 
Plaintiffs do not bring a cause of action under the FDCA. Instead, the FDCA is relevant only insofar as Plaintiffs allege it serves 
as a predicate law for their UCL claim, which the Court discusses infra."
1256,5," Although Plaintiffs address statutory standing for the UCL, FAL, and CLRA claims in their opposition, see ECF No. 25 at 12-13, 
Defendant only raised Article III standing in its motion to dismiss. HN6[
] As statutory standing is not jurisdictional, the Court need not reach the issue sua sponte. Jewel v. Nat'l Sec. Agency, 673 F.3d 902, 907 n.4 (9th Cir. 2011). "
1257,6," While the Second Circuit has determined that GBL claims need not meet the Rule 9(b) particularity requirement, see Pelman 
ex rel. Pelman v. McDonald's Corp., 396 F.3d 508, 511 (2d Cir. 2005), its reasoning appears at odds with the Ninth Circuit's 
decision in Kearns, which held that even claims that do not reflect the elements of common law fraud must meet Rule 9(b)'s 
requirements if they are grounded in fraud. See Keegan v. Am. Honda Motor Co., 838 F. Supp. 2d 929, 958 (C.D. Cal. 2012). 
The Court therefore presumes that Rule 9(b) applies to allegations of fraudulent conduct underlying Plaintiffs' GBL claims."
1257,7," The products identified in the FAC are: Sparkling Peach Vibe, Sparkling Orange, Sparkling Wild Berry, Sparkling Grape Rush, 
Raspberry Acai Green Tea, Grapefruit Melon Green Tea, Sparkling Fuji Apple Pear, Sparkling Kiwi Guava, Sparkling 
Watermelon, Peach Mango Green Tea, Jackfruit, Cherry Lime, Strawberry Dragon Fruit, Blueberry Pomegranate, Sparkling 
Blood Orange Lemonade, Watermelon Berry, Sparkling Grapefruit, Sparkling Orange Pomegranate, and Sparkling Cucumber 
Lime. FAC ¶ 28 n.3. "
1258,8," Defendant's argument that Plaintiffs must allege Defendant was aware of a defect at the time of sale for their CLRA claim is 
unconvincing. Wilson v. Hewlett-Packard HN11[
] dealt with an alleged fraudulent omission, and stands for the principle that a 
plaintiff must adequately allege the defendant was aware of a product defect in order to state a CLRA claim arising from the 
defendant's failure to disclose that defect, because a seller generally has no duty to disclose defects of which it is not aware. 
Wilson v. Hewlett-Packard Co., 668 F.3d 1136, 1145 (9th Cir. 2012). Plaintiffs adequately allege that Defendant knowingly made 
an affirmative misrepresentation by marketing the product with the fruit name and vignette despite being aware the product 
contained no fruit at the time of sale."
1258,9," Plaintiffs argue that this standard applies to their ""unlawful"" UCL claims only insofar as the predicate act contains the 
reasonable consumer test. ECF No. 25 at 18. Because the Court concludes the FAC adequately alleges deception under the 
reasonable consumer standard, the Court does not resolve this issue. "
1259,10," The section provides: ""(1) Express warranties by the seller are created as follows: (a) Any affirmation of fact or promise made by the seller to the buyer which relates to the goods and becomes part of the 
basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the goods shall conform to the affirmation or promise. (b) Any description of the goods which is made part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the goods 
shall conform to the description. (c) Any sample or model which is made part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the whole of the 
goods shall conform to the sample or model. (2) It is not necessary to the creation of an express warranty that the seller use formal words such as 'warrant' or 'guarantee' or 
that he have a specific intention to make a warranty, but an affirmation merely of the value of the goods or a statement 
purporting to be merely the seller's opinion or commendation of the goods does not create a warranty."" "
1261,11," The case cited by Defendant, Clark v. Westbrae Natural, Inc., is distinguishable because the court found it implausible, based 
on the facts alleged, that a reasonable consumer would expect the inclusion of the word ""vanilla"" indicates that the flavor is 
derived exclusively from the vanilla bean. Clark v. Westbrae Nat., Inc., No. 20-CV-03221-JSC, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 224966, 
2020 WL 7043879, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 1, 2020). Plaintiffs more plausibly allege that a reasonable consumer would believe a 
drink advertising a particular fruit contains at least some amount of that fruit. "
1262,12," Because Plaintiffs plausibly allege Defendant engaged in a prohibited act under Section 1770(a)(5), representing the goods 
have an ingredient they do not have, the Court does not reach Plaintiffs' alternative theories under the CLRA."
1262,13," HN22[
] Section 349(h) provides a private right of action. N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law § 349(h). The private right of action for Section"
1262,350, claims is provided in Section 350-e. N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law § 350-e(1). 
1267,1," See Plfs. Brief at 20/Docket 268 at 26; Def. Brief at 11, 16, 18/Docket 299 at 18, 23, 25. "
1268,2," The Court notes the Supreme Court issued its decision in NCAA v. Alston,     U.S.    , 141 S.Ct. 2141, 210 L. Ed. 2d 314 
(2021), after the parties had briefed their motion for class certification. The Court allowed each party to file a brief discussing the 
impact of that case on this motion. "
1271,3," Likewise, plaintiff Turner failed to state a claim under the rule of reason. Her complaint is limited to a quick look claim. [Case 
No. 19-cv-5524, Docket 1]."
1271,4," The Court is not suggesting that this evidence is undisputed or that a fact-finder would find it persuasive. The point is merely 
that in the face of defendants' significant evidence of pro-competitive effects, a full analysis under the rule of reason, rather than 
a quick look, is necessary. "
1274,5," Plaintiffs also put forth evidence that, in 2015, the McOpCos, after raising their starting wages by $1 per hour, decided not to 
hire employees from franchisees for a period of one year. Whether that constituted a unilateral act or a horizontal agreement in 
connection with a vertical relationship is not clear from the evidence. Even if it is the latter, it still would be horizontal only where 
McOpCos compete with franchisees, not nationwide. "
1277,6," Because the Court has determined that the question of whether the restraint caused anticompetitive effects in the hundreds (or 
thousands) of relevant markets will predominate, the Court need not consider whether the question of antitrust impact is a 
common question. (It is difficult, though, to imagine that it could be a common question, as opposed to a question that would 
need to be answered separately for each relevant market. Each person's injury is the amount his or her wages were suppressed 
multiplied by the hours worked. The amount each person's wages are suppressed will almost certainly vary depending on the 
amount of labor market power McDonald's possessed in each relevant market. See, e.g. State of Ala. v. Blue Bird Body Co., 
Inc., 573 F.2d 309, 327-28 (5th Cir. 1978) (""This proof of injury in a price-fixing case will generally consist of some showing by 
the plaintiff that, as a result of this conspiracy, he had to pay supracompetitive prices for school buses. . . . [W]e do not 
understand how the plaintiffs can make this proof without examining the relevant school bus market where each individual 
plaintiff is located."").) Because the Court need not consider whether impact is a common question, the Court need not decide 
whether to exclude the report and testimony of plaintiff's expert, Dr. Singer. See Messner, 669 F.3d at 812 (""When an expert's 
report or testimony is 'critical to class certification,' we have held that a district court must make a conclusive ruling on any 
challenge to that expert's qualifications or submissions before it may rule on a motion for class certification.""). Here, the outcome 
of this motion is the same with or without Dr. Singer's report and testimony. The same is true as to the report and testimony of 
Dr. Capelli. "
1278,7," One might think this would have prompted defendants to consent to certification of a class, such that they could win with one 
fell swoop. Thomas v. UBS AG, 706 F.3d 846, 850 (7th Cir. 2013) (""[Defendant] opposed [class] certification even though a 
defendant with a winning case has much to gain from it—the judgment for a defendant will be res judicata in any suit by a class 
member who had not opted out of the class, provided 'that the named plaintiff at all times adequately represent the interests of 
absent class members.'"") (citation omitted). Perhaps defendants assume most plaintiffs will opt out of a doomed-to-fail class. In 
any case, defendants do not want a nationwide class certified, and they will get their wish."
1278,8," The problems discussed above are not the only problems with the proposed class definition. As defendants point out, the 
proposed class is overly broad in that it contains individuals who could not have been injured by the alleged wrongful conduct. 
""[I]f the [class] definition is so broad that it sweeps within it persons who could not have been injured by the defendant's conduct, 
it is too broad."" Kohen v. Pacific Inv. Mgt. Co., LLC, 571 F.3d 672, 677 (7th Cir. 2009); Messner, 669 F.3d at 824 (""If, however, a 
class is defined so broadly as to include a great number of members who for some reason could not have been harmed by the 
defendant's allegedly unlawful conduct, the class is defined too broadly to permit certification.""). Here, plaintiffs challenge a 
hiring restriction that applies only to current employees or employees who have left in the past six months. It can have no effect 
on new hires or on employees within the first few weeks of work. More than 2% of new hires leave within two weeks. More than 
11% leave within a month. More than 20% leave within two months. (Figure 12 of Dr. Murphy Rep. at p. 67). It is clear the 
proposed class definition was too broad, but the Court need not decide by what degree. "
1286,1," The facts recited below are mostly taken from the complaint, the allegations of which I must accept as true for purposes of this 
motion. See Broam v. Bogan, 320 F.3d 1023, 1028 (9th Cir. 2003)."

1313,1," There are three bases for a UCL claim, ""unlawful,"" ""fraudulent,"" and ""unfair"" conduct. Beaver, 816 F.3d at 1177. Morena 
presumably knows exactly what conduct of YCH violates which aspects of the UCL. It is up to Morena to clearly explain its 
theories of liability. It is not enough for Morena to say that the entirety of YCH's conduct is at issue and then identify only one act 
by Hernandez. Since Morena has only identified one act by Hernandez, the Court will only focus on Hernandez's misleading 
acts/misrepresentations in obtaining Chavez's copyright interests."
1313,2," The Court notes that any injury to Chavez would appear to be theoretical at best. By believing Hernandez, Chavez may have 
actually obtained a windful because Yellowcake allegedly was attempting to pay for all rights that existed in the copyrights, not 
just Chavez's. Presumably one would pay more to be a sole-owner of a copyright, as opposed to a joint-owner. Thus, it seems 
unlikely that Chavez has suffered any injury from the conduct of YCH. "
1314,3," The Court also agrees with YCH that the complaint improperly lumps all Defendants together under the third cause of action 
without adequately differentiating which defendant committed which wrongful acts, or how each Defendant may be liable for the 
acts of another Defendants. See FAC ¶¶ 53-57. The third cause of action therefore violates the general rule that broad 
allegations that lump multiple defendants together without distinguishing the alleged wrongs or actions between the defendants 
fail to provide individual defendants with adequate notice. See Warnshuis v. Bausch Health U.S., LLC, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
107136, *23 (E.D. Cal. June 18, 2020) (and cases cited therein)."
1314,4," Again, Morena indicated that the entirety of YCH's conduct is at issue for purposes of its UCL claim. If Morena can identify 
specific conduct by Yellowcake, Colonize, or Hernandez that is actionable under the UCL, then Morena can file a motion for 
reconsideration of the decision to dismiss the third cause of action without leave to amend. "
1321,1," Although the FAC describes SJRA as wholesaling only ""raw surface water"" to utilities, the GRP Contracts provide for SJRA to

were recodified but was not relocated to a new code. All citations in this opinion are to the version of SJRA's Enabling Statute

Statute to our decision for reference. "
1322,3," The Lone Star Plan defined ""Large Volume Groundwater User"" or ""LVGU"" as ""any person or entity that, through a single well or 
a combination of wells, actually produced or was authorized by a permit or permits issued by [Lone Star] to produce 10 million 
gallons or more of groundwater annually from the Gulf Coast Aquifer within the [Lone Star] District during calendar year 2009. A 
Large Volume Groundwater User does not include any person or entity that produces groundwater solely for its own domestic 
use associated with a single family residence, agricultural use, as that term is defined by Chapter 36, Water Code, or both 
domestic and agricultural use."" "
1323,4," This issue is the subject of an active circuit split. Every other circuit to have considered this issue disagrees with our precedent, 
instead holding that interlocutory appeals from denials of state-action immunity may not be taken under the collateral order 
doctrine. See Huron Valley Hosp., Inc. v. City of Pontiac, 792 F.2d 563, 567-68 (6th Cir. 1986); S.C. State Bd. of Dentistry v.

138 S. Ct. 1323, 200 L. Ed. 2d 510 (2018). Last month, the en banc Eleventh Circuit held that ""interlocutory appeals may not be

SmileDirectClub, 4 F.4th 1274, 2021 U.S. App. LEXIS 21393, at *2, *18-19. Other courts, in critiquing our precedent, have noted that (1) the Supreme Court has repeatedly emphasized the narrowness of 
the collateral order doctrine in recent decisions, see SmileDirectClub, 4 F.4th 1274, 2021 U.S. App. LEXIS 21393, at *6; 
SolarCity, 859 F.3d at 730; (2) the Court in Will v. Hallock held that government defendants are not entitled to immediate 
appealability merely to avoid the burdens of trial absent ""some particular value of a high order,"" see SolarCity, 859 F.3d at 724 
(discussing 546 U.S. 345, 352-55, 126 S. Ct. 952, 163 L. Ed. 2d 836 (2006)); see also SmileDirectClub, 4 F.4th 1274, 2021 U.S. 
App. LEXIS 21393, at *16-17; and (3) as our en banc court has observed, ""Parker immunity is an inapt description, for its 
parentage differs from the qualified and absolute immunities of public officials. . . . 'Parker immunity' is more accurately a strict 
standard for locating the reach of the Sherman Act than the judicial creation of a defense to liability for its violation."" Surgical

1353,2," Ms. Grajeda testified that Amerigroup only offers Medicaid and Medicare plans in New Jersey. Tr. at 282:1-4. The FTC, 
however, expressly excludes Medicare Advantage and managed Medicaid insurers from its relevant product market. FTC Br. at 
17 n.42. As a result, the Court finds little probative value to Ms. Grajeda's testimony."
1353,3, Dr. Dafny also testified as a rebuttal expert. 
1354,4," Plaintiff also sought to qualify Dr. Romano as an expert on capacity issues from the hospital operations perspective, including 
calculations of capacity or steps that a hospital could take to relieve capacity issues. Defendants challenged Dr. Romano's 
qualification regarding capacity issues, outside of the limited scope of how capacity challenges impact the quality of care. D.E. 
264. Dr. Romano is a clinical practitioner. He does not have experience with healthcare system capacity constraints from the 
operational viewpoint. As a result, the Court grants Defendants' request to preclude Dr. Romano as an expert on operational 
capacity issues."
1354,5," Citations to ""Tr."" refer to the transcript from the seven-day evidentiary hearing in this matter. "
1356,6," On June 1, 2021, Defendants provided the Court with their list of exhibits that they seek to move into evidence. D.E. 332. The 
FTC provided its list on June 7, 2021, D.E. 340, and Defendants provided a supplemental list on June 9, 2021. D.E. 344. The 
parties also set forth a limited list of objections to documents on the exhibit lists. D.E. 331, 332, 344. The Court addresses the 
objections to PX1061, the Optimization Plans, and the Waiver Letters below. Otherwise, the Court did not rely on any of the 
documents for which there remain objections so the objections are moot. Those exhibits without objections in D.E. 332, 340 and 
344 are admitted into evidence."
1356,7," Of course, there could be at least one other rational business reason for establishing outpatient facilities without regard to 
inpatient admissions: they are independently profitable. The parties, however, did not address this point, so the Court does not 
speculate. "
1357,8," When referring to commercial insurers herein, the Court does not distinguish between fully insured and self-insured plans, as 
the difference is immaterial to the Court's analysis."
1357,9," The Court notes that New Jersey has GeoAccess standards that apply to certain commercial and government plans. These 
standards generally require that an insurance company's network offers the requisite number of providers and facilities within a 
certain distance, time, and mileage of the insured population. Tr. at 330:2-10. "
1358,10," The case-mix index is used to compare the level of care provided at different hospitals and facilities. The higher the case-mix 
index, the higher the overall acuity, or complexity of care, provided at the facility. See Tr. at 191:8-15; 397:6-10. "
1359,11," During the hearing, the FTC emphasized the fact that Horizon, HMH and RWJBH are co-owners of Braven Health, a new 
Medicare Advantage program. Tr. at 1131:12-1132:1; 1069:9-25. These entities share [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] 
generated by Braven Health, with [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT]. Tr. at 1075:20-1076:1; 1131:21-23. This relationship 
creates an additional financial incentive for Horizon to keep patients at HMH's hospitals. The FTC also emphasized the fact that 
except for HSS, Horizon does not have any direct contracts with New York hospitals. Tr. at 1131:3-11. Again, this also creates a 
motive to support the merger that is unique to Horizon. Similarly, Defendants emphasized that Atlantic and United formed a 
competing physicians' practice group, which gives both United and Atlantic a motive to oppose the proposed merger. The Court 
ultimately gives the various relationships little weight as the evidence did not adequately establish how the insurers' motives 
resulted in slanted or biased testimony. "
1360,12," By way of reference, HUMC defines a primary service area as the geographic area where 75% of inpatient discharges 
originate. Tr. at 1158:18-21. Englewood provided Chartis with information about its PSA but Defendants did not provide any 
evidence explaining how Englewood determined its PSA."
1360,13," Generally, a narrow network insurance product offers members access to fewer providers than the insurance company's 
standard offering. Tr. at 241:9-24. "
1361,14," The FTC introduced Blazer's email during its cross-examination of Garrett. Defendants objected to the email because Garrett 
was not copied on it. Tr. at 824:8-11. The FTC established that while Blazer was the point person for the merger transaction, 
Garrett had final sign-off. Tr. at 823:6-15; 824:14-21. Moreover, as noted, Garrett sent the letter to Chartis soon after the email. 
Given the timing of the two documents, the similarity in content, and Blazer and Garrett's roles, it is reasonable to infer that 
Garrett was aware of the contents of Blazer's email, PX1061, when Garrett wrote the letter. See Egan v. Live Nation Worldwide, 
Inc., 764 F. App'x 204, 208-09 (3d Cir. 2019) (explaining that the burden to authenticate a document under Fed. R. Evid. 901 is 
""slight"" and that a ""party can meet its burden by making 'a prima facie showing of some competent evidence to support 
authentication'"" (quoting United States v. Turner, 718 F.3d 226, 232 (3d Cir. 2013))). "

1363,17," [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT], the testimony of Anderson from Chartis suggested that [TEXT REDACTED BY THE 
COURT] was due to [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT]. PX6004-006. "
1364,18," There was no evidence that HUMC or HMH would face perilous economic consequences if it transferred those case to 
Englewood. "
1366,19," Although specific inpatient GAC services are not interchangeable, courts and parties look at these services together as a 
""cluster"" when the competitive conditions are reasonably similar across services. See ProMedica Health Sys., Inc. v. FTC, 749 
F.3d 559, 565-66 (6th Cir. 2014); see also Penn State Hershey Med. Ctr., 838 F.3d at 338 (defining relevant product market at 
general acute care services sold to commercial payors). "
1367,20," The Merger Guidelines are issued by the U.S. Department of Justice's Antitrust Division and the FTC. Although the Guidelines 
are not binding on this Court, ""they are often used as persuasive authority."" Penn State Hershey Med. Ctr., 838 F.3d at 338 n.2 
(quoting Saint Alphonsus Med. Ctr.-Nampa Inc. v. Saint Lukes Health Sys., Ltd., 778 F.3d 775, 784 n.9 (9th Cir. 2015)). "
1369,21," It is not clear if Garrett or Geller were even aware of HUMC or Englewood's PSAs before this litigation began. See Tr. at 
806:11-18; Tr. at 908:1-25. If the top executives of the entities at issue here were not aware of this information in ordinary 
course, it is difficult to infer that payors were aware of the PSA for either entity or that it was relevant to payors' decisions when 
forming their networks."
1369,22," Defendants harp on Dr. Dafny's use of the word ""significant"" as a subjective and the fact that Dr. Dafny did not quantify the 
actual harm. Tr. at 622:10-15; 624:3-8. But Dr. Dafny's conclusion about ""significant"" harm is supported by data — that 75% of "
1370,," Bergen County residents receive care within the County. Further, Dr. Dafny characterized the harm as significant to indicate that 
it was enough to continue with (not end) her analysis as to whether Bergen County satisfied the HMT. Tr. at 622:19-24."
1370,23," In any event, the Third Circuit has found that true complements can nevertheless potentially run afoul of the antitrust laws. See 
Penn State Hershey Med. Ctr., 838 F.3d at 334, 353-54 (granting preliminary injunction of proposed merger of academic medical 
center that specialized in complex services and a health system that focused on primary and secondary care). "
1371,24," Dr. Wu indicated that there is no actual evidence of price discrimination in Bergen County and that if more hospitals were 
considered, it does not seem possible that a hypothetical monopolist could raise prices for Bergen County residents. Tr. at 
944:4-16. Putting aside the Third Circuit's remonstration that the HMT is hypothetical, Wu's analysis appears to ignore the 
commercial reality that the large majority of Bergen County residents do seek inpatient GAC services in Bergen County. Dr. Wu 
also challenged Dr. Dafny's HMT for focusing on hospitals rather than patients. Tr. at 943. The Court disagrees with this 
reasoning. The patients would be the appropriate focus in the opposite scenario — if an insurance company merger was being 
challenged and the resulting hypothetical monopolist had all of the commercially insured customers in Bergen County. Then the 
inquiry would be whether such an insurer monopolist could impose a SSNIP (meaning a larger discount for the monopolist) on 
the hospitals. "
1372,25," Dr. Dafny also calculated HHI using a hospital-based approach, as a ""sensitivity check,"" which also resulted in an HHI over 
2,500 and a change in HHI greater than 200. Tr. at 647:7-648:22. The patient-based calculation is the more conservative of the 
two approaches. Tr. at 648:10-13. "
1373,26," In addition to the patient-choice model, Dafny also calculated willingness to pay using a hospital-choice model. Tr. at 575-76. 
When considering all discharges in a four-county area, Dafny concluded that ""the parties combined yields an increase in this 
willingness to pay of 10.1% per discharge."" Tr. at 576:2-9. Dafny then estimated that the 10% increase caused a 5.7% price 
increase for transaction absent any cost efficiencies, and it would increase Englewood's price around 35%. Tr. at 576-78. "
1374,27," The Court notes that [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] and [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] contracts were executed 
after the proposed transaction was announced, and [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] negotiations for its current contract 
with HMH occurred after the announcement. [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT]. "
1375,28," Defendants also argue that, based on Third Circuit precedent, the Court cannot consider private agreements or contractual 
language in conducting an antitrust analysis. The Court disagrees. The Third Circuit has clearly stated that private contracts 
cannot be considered in determining the relevant product market or the relevant geographic market. Penn State Hershey Med. 
Ctr., 838 F.3d at 344 (citing Queen City Pizza, Inc. v. Domino's Pizza, Inc., 124 F.3d 430, 438-39 (3d Cir. 1997)). But the 
Acquisition Clause is being considered as to anticompetitive effects, not in defining the relevant market."
1375,29, Defendants contend that the Waiver Letters are enforceable on equitable grounds. D.E. 313.
1375,30, [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT].
1375,31," Defendants also contend that adding Englewood will not increase HMH's leverage with commercial insurers. Defs. FOF ¶¶ 
113-21. Dr. Dafny acknowledged that Englewood does not have much bargaining leverage when compared to HMH, Tr. at 
1522:9-10, and unlike HUMC, no commercial insurer testified that it needed Englewood in its network to create a desirable 
network. However, Defendants conflate two separate issues. The first is whether HMH and HUMC are more important to 
insurers than Englewood. The answer to that inquiry is clearly yes. The second is whether adding Englewood to HMH will further 
increase HMH's leverage with insurers. The answer to that query is, based on the evidence, yes-subject to a final determination 
in the administrative action. "
1377,32," For the reasons stated in note 37, the Court declines the FTC's invitation to analyze and compare the capital investment 
offered by [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] to Englewood during their merger discussions. "
1378,33," Defendants submitted their June 8 letter with leave of Court, in response to questions that arose during closing arguments. 
While Defendants reference exhibits that were included in its exhibit list in the June 8 letter, they also rely on documents that 
were not on their exhibit list. Defendants sought leave to admit these additional exhibits into evidence. These new documents 
are not critical to Defendants' argument on this issue, nor are they pertinent to the Court's conclusion. As a result, the Court 
does not reach the request for leave to admit."
1378,34," In fact, the FTC also points out that statements from the Optimization Plan are word-for-word copies of statements made in a 
July 21, 2021 white paper that Defendants submitted to the FTC to support this merger. D.E. 246 at 6-7. Defendants counter that 
in actuality, the statements from the white paper were ""derived from and consistent with their internal analysis and integration 
planning activities."" D.E. 256 at 7. But the first draft of the Optimization Plan was not created until February 2021. Moreover, 
despite Defendants' position that the white paper was influenced by Defendants' integration planning activities, Defendants fail to 
point to any documents that support this statement. Even Defendants' additional documents identified in their June 8 Letter do 
not reflect that such work product existed. Tellingly, not a single document cited in the letter makes even passing reference 
HUMC's capacity constraints. "
1379,35," In fact, when HMH acquired Pascack Valley, one of its stated reasons to reopen the facility was to serve as a pressure relief 
valve for overflow patients at HUMC. Tr. at 1437:25-4. But at the present time, Pascack Valley only operates at about 50% to 
60% of its occupancy rate. Tr. at 1212:12-15. "
1380,36," The Court notes that Dr. Gowrisankaran utilized a patient-choice model for his analysis of the cost-savings that HMH will 
realize by capturing outmigration. The Court also notes that one of Dr. Wu's critiques of Dr. Dafny's analysis is that she 
improperly used a patient-choice model."
1380,37," Defendants frame this as an efficiency. Defs. FOF ¶¶ 27-29. The FTC argues that these service optimization efficiencies are 
not merger specific because they could also be achieved if Englewood chose a different merger partner, such as [TEXT 
REDACTED BY THE COURT]. See Plf. COL ¶ 46. An efficiency is merger specific if it ""cannot be achieved by either company 
alone because, if they can, the merger's asserted benefits can be achieved without the concomitant loss of a competitor."" H.J. 
Heinz Co., 246 F.3d at 722. Thus, there is no legal requirement that Defendants must compare the efficiencies alleged here with 
those of a different hypothetical merger partner. And the FTC has cited no authority indicating that a court can consider other 
potential merger partners in conducting an efficiencies analysis. The merger specific inquiry focuses on the efficiencies that 
could theoretically be achieved by either merging entity alone, absent the merger."
1380,38," The Court is also concerned that neither Ms. Ahern nor anyone from her team, produced any notes, despite the fact that she 
interviewed more than 100 Englewood and HMH employees, because, according to Ahern, her team is well versed in the field of 
healthcare organizations and operations. Tr. at 140:6-1402:11. Yet, neither Ms. Ahern nor any of her team members claimed to 
have an eidetic memory. Further, no explanation was provided as to how Ms. Ahern was able to effectively incorporate her 
team's verbal work product into her final report. Absent an extraordinary and credible explanation, the Court cannot fathom how 
Ms. Ahern and her team were able to accurately synthesize over 100 interviews from memory alone."
1380,39," The FTC seeks to preclude Defendants from relying on certain portions of Dr. Meyer's report because Dr. Meyer destroyed 
notes from interviews that were incorporated into his report, in contravention of the Case Management Order. D.E. 248. The 
FTC seeks to exclude those portions of the report that relied on the destroyed notes under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 
37(b)(2)(A). A court has broad discretion when imposing sanctions pursuant to Rule 37(b). Wachtel v. Health Net, Inc., 239 "
1381,," F.R.D. 81, 84 (D.N.J. 2006). In this instance, although Dr. Meyer intentionally destroyed his notes, there is no evidence of bad 
faith. Accordingly, the Court denies the FTC's request."
1381,40," Even if the Court were to conclude that Defendants rebutted the FTC's prima facie case that the merger will be 
anticompetitive, the Court would conclude that the FTC appropriately meets its burden of persuasion to demonstrate a likelihood 
of success in establishing that the merger violates Section 7. "
1388,1," ""Merck"" refers to Defendants-Appellants Merck & Co., Inc.; Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp.; Schering-Plough Corp.; Schering 
Corp.; and MSP Singapore Co. LLC."
1388,2," ""Glenmark"" refers to Defendants-Appellants Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd. and Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Inc., USA."
1388,3," Federal law gives competing drug manufacturers the opportunity to introduce generic versions of branded drugs. Generic 
manufacturers may obtain FDA approval through an abbreviated review process so long as the generic is a bioequivalent of the 
approved, brand-name drug. "
1390,4," In a footnote, the district court suggested our precedent permits it to compare the practicability of a class to that of individual 
trials, noting that ""the Third Circuit's statements in Modafinil are contrary to those of other courts, including the Fourth Circuit."" 
J.A. 1919 n.9. We disagree. The district court's conclusion relied on Ballard, which observed in passing that individual suits could 
increase the volume of discovery. See 543 F.2d at 1080. This comment, which is dicta, directly conflicts with the language of 
Rule 23(a)(1). We therefore afford it no weight and do not consider it binding precedent."
1390,5," And in analyzing this factor, district courts should bear in mind Rule 23(a)'s high standard, which asks whether a variety of 
factors make joinder not only uneconomical but also economically impracticable. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1). "
1391,6," The district court made this finding despite noting that Plaintiffs ""offered little case-specific and member-specific evidence that 
class members would not join the suit on their own."" J.A. 1920. HN6[
] But Rule 23 places on Plaintiffs the burden of ""present[ing] evidence that the putative class complies with Rule 23."" See EQT Prod., 764 F.3d at 357. And in presenting this 
evidence, Plaintiffs must do more than simply show that litigating as a class—rather than joinder—would offer marginal 
economic benefits. HN7[
] True, ""[i]mpracticable does not mean impossible."" Robidoux v. Celani, 987 F.2d 931, 935 (2d Cir."
1391,1993," ). But the impracticability standard recognizes that ""[t]he class action is 'an exception to the usual rule that litigation is 
conducted by and on behalf of the individual named parties only.'"" Wal-Mart Stores, 564 U.S. at 348 (quoting Califano v. 
Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 700-01, 99 S. Ct. 2545, 61 L. Ed. 2d 176 (1979)). We see little evidence in the record to support this 
point, and we expect that the district court will require Plaintiffs to adduce such evidence on remand to establish impracticability."
1391,7," Notably underscoring the district court's analysis of this factor is the assumption that if even one party may be unmotivated to 
litigate their small-value claims, Rule 23(a)(1) is satisfied because joinder of ""all members"" would then be impracticable. See 
Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1) (emphasis added). But—HN8[
] as the Third Circuit stated in Modafinil—some parties being 
economically unmotivated to litigate via joinder is only one of many factors to consider in making an impracticability of joinder 
consideration. 837 F.3d at 259 (""Even if it were uneconomical for some . . . of the[ ] individual plaintiffs to join the suit, the District 
Court must still determine whether, considering all the other relevant factors, class status . . . is appropriate here.""). "
1392,8," HN15[
] Generally, ""only direct purchasers from an antitrust violator can sue for damages."" Dickson v. Microsoft Corp., 309 F.3d 193 (4th Cir. 2002). When Glenmark began making the generic drug in December 2016, it sold the generic to its exclusive 
dealer Par at cost-plus-shipping. Plaintiffs allege that Par is therefore a co-conspirator, so the district court erred in dismissing 
the claims of the twenty-three companies who purchased generic ezetimibe from Par rather than from Glenmark. See Apple Inc. 
v. Pepper, 139 S. Ct. 1514, 1521, 203 L. Ed. 2d 802 (2019) (noting that ""immediate buyers from the alleged antitrust violators"" 
can be construed as direct purchasers under the Clayton Act (cleaned up)). But see Ill. Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 730- "
1393,33," , 97 S. Ct. 2061, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1977) (prohibiting an indirect purchaser from suing for overcharges passed on to it from an 
upstream dealer). "
1397,1," Plaintiff filed this action against an additional Defendant which had filed a separate Motion to Dismiss (DE 24). That Defendant 
has since been voluntarily dismissed from this action. (DE 41). "
1398,2," I note that this appears to be required only ""[i]f an increase [in lot rental amount] is based upon the lot rental amount charged by 
comparable mobile home parks."" Fla. Stat. § 723.037(4)(b)1. "
1399,3," The Florida Antitrust Act's construction provision provides: ""It is the intent of the Legislature that, in construing this chapter, due 
consideration and great weight be given to the interpretations of the federal courts relating to comparable federal antitrust 
statutes."" Fla. Stat. § 542.32. "
1400,4," I have also considered Defendants' arguments that Plaintiff's ""conspiracy to monopolize"" theory ""has no foundation or place in 
this case"" and that the Amended Complaint is ""an improper shotgun pleading."" (DE 23 at 2). However, I decline to analyze those "
1401,," here, as Defendants failed to set forth a cogent argument for either ground and, instead, only mentioned the grounds in passing. 
And although the Amended Complaint appears to suffer from several deficiencies, Defendants failed to sufficiently challenge the 
deficiencies by asserting arguments supported by the applicable law. "
1413,1," Plaintiff alleges that Senator Jolly was allied with Central and Jarboe and acted for their benefit. However, plaintiff makes no 
allegations supporting these contentions. "
1414,2, The Court notes that the proposed amendment does contain the operative language. 
1415,3," Plaintiff also alleges that defendants' actions ""constitute a violation of . . . the Oklahoma Anti Trust Reform Act,"" under Okla. 
Stat. tit. 79, § 201 et seq. That may be a true statement, if proven, but that does not state a claim for relief. Plaintiff does not 
state a separate count or claim based on Oklahoma statutory law. The Court will not infer one. "
1416,4," Unpublished decisions are not precedential, but they may be cited for their persuasive value. See Fed. R. App. 32.1; 10th Cir. 
R. 32.1. "
1420,5," Because the Court finds there is more than one plus factor alleged, the Court finds a conspiracy has been alleged. As a result, 
although only one competitor is having been charged expressly with this conduct in the amended complaint, this action was 
likely taken in furtherance of the attempts to eliminate Boardwalk as a competitor, as part of the conspiracy."
1420,6," HN15[
] Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act prohibits ""attempt[s] to monopolize ... any part of the trade or commerce among the several States . . . ."" "

1447,2," The complaint also named Weisheng's affiliates Shijiazhuang Pharmaceutical (USA) Inc. and China Pharmaceutical Group,

1447,3," As explained below, the other defendants settled before or during trial, and therefore only Hebei and NCPG brought this 
appeal."
1447,4," We discuss in detail the Ministry's submissions, four in total, later in our analysis. See Section III.C.3, infra."
1447,5," The district court determined that there had been no foreign sovereign compulsion because the defendants' anticompetitive 
conduct was voluntary, not compelled, and the defendants had not shown that they faced a risk of severe sanctions for 
noncompliance. Id. at 554-58. Further, even if Chinese law did involve some compulsion, it ""assuredly did not compel all of 
defendants' illegal conduct,"" and therefore the defense did not extend to anticompetitive measures affirmatively adopted by the 
defendants. Id. at 554. "
1448,6," See United States v. Park, 758 F.3d 193, 199-200 (2d Cir. 2014) (explaining that ""abuse of discretion"" is a ""distinctive term of 
art that is not meant as a derogatory statement about the district judge whose decision is found wanting"")."
1448,7," As explained below, see Section III.A n.8, infra, we understand international comity to apply here as a form of prescriptive 
comity: ""a canon of [statutory] construction"" that may serve to ""shorten the reach of a statute."" In re Picard, Tr., 917 F.3d at 100 
(internal quotation marks omitted). In other contexts, international comity functions instead as a type of ""adjudicative comity,"" 
""the so-called comity among courts,"" which ""may be viewed as a discretionary act of deference by a national court to decline to 
exercise jurisdiction in a case properly adjudicated in a foreign state."" Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). Even were we to 
consider this case under the rubric of adjudicative comity—which principally applies when a district court has declined to 
exercise jurisdiction in deference to ongoing proceedings in a foreign court—we would in any event review that decision under 
an unusually rigorous abuse-of-discretion standard that leaves ""little practical distinction between review for abuse of discretion 
and review de novo."" Id. at 102 (quoting Hachamovitch v. DeBuono, 159 F.3d 687, 693 (2d Cir. 1998)). "
1449,8," As noted above, our application of international comity in this case involves ""prescriptive comity""—a form of statutory 
interpretation—rather than the abstention-based doctrine of ""adjudicatory comity."" These are ""two district legal doctrines,"" In re 
Maxwell, 93 F.3d at 1047, and although they ""sometimes demand similar analysis, each asks a different question and is rooted 
in a different legal theory,"" In re Picard, 917 F.3d at 101 (internal quotation marks omitted). In Hartford Fire, the Supreme Court seemed to assume that international comity should be treated as an abstention doctrine. 
See 509 U.S. at 798 (considering, but not deciding, ""whether a court with Sherman Act jurisdiction should ever decline to 
exercise such jurisdiction on grounds of international comity."" (emphasis added)). In dissent, Justice Scalia proposed an 
alternative analysis based on prescriptive comity: ""Congress is generally presumed not to have exceeded . . . customary 
international-law limits"" and therefore ""statutes should not be interpreted to regulate foreign persons or conduct if that regulation 
would conflict with principles of international law."" 509 U.S. at 815 (Scalia, J., dissenting). The Supreme Court's subsequent 
decision in F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. v. Empagran S.A., cited Justice Scalia's dissent in Hartford Fire with approval, and it 
relied on this rule of prescriptive comity, based in statutory construction, which ""cautions courts to assume that legislators take 
account of the legitimate sovereign interests of other nations when they write American laws [and] thereby helps the potentially 
conflicting laws of different nations work together in harmony."" 542 U.S. 155, 164, 124 S. Ct. 2359, 159 L. Ed. 2d 226 (2004). In keeping with F. Hoffman-La Roche, we consider how Congress presumably intended courts to construe U.S. antitrust law ""to 
avoid unreasonable interference with the sovereign authority of other nations."" Id; see also In re Maxwell, 93 F.3d at 1047 
(""When construing a statute, the doctrine of international comity is best understood as a guide where the issues to be resolved 
are entangled in international relations.""). That approach to understanding statutes is not of recent vintage—indeed, it has been 
here all along. As Chief Justice Marshall explained long ago in the case of the Charming Betsy, ""an act of Congress ought never

1449,9," In Timberlane, the Ninth Circuit identified seven factors for courts to balance when considering when an extraterritorial 
assertion of jurisdiction is justified. 549 F.2d at 614. In Mannington Mills, the Third Circuit expressed ""substantial agreement"" 
with Timberlane's balancing test. 595 F.2d at 1297. The court noted that ""foreign policy, reciprocity, comity, and limitations of 
judicial power are considerations that should have a bearing on the decision to exercise or decline jurisdiction"" when foreign 
nations are involved. Id. at 1296. It then distilled those concerns into ten factors: "
1450,," (1) Degree of conflict with foreign law [**12]  or policy; (2) Nationality of the parties; (3) Relative importance of the alleged violation of conduct here compared to that abroad; (4) Availability of a remedy abroad and the pendency of litigation there; (5) Existence of intent to harm or affect American commerce and its foreseeability; (6) Possible effect upon foreign relations if the court exercises jurisdiction and grants relief; (7) If relief is granted, whether a party will be placed in the position of being forced to perform an act illegal in either country 
or be under conflicting requirements by both countries; (8) Whether the court can make its order effective; (9) Whether an order for relief would be acceptable in this country if made by the foreign nation under similar 
circumstances; [and] (10) Whether a treaty with the affected nations has addressed the issue. Id. at 1297-98 (internal footnote omitted)."
1450,10," In Hartford Fire, certain American insurance companies and their London-based reinsurers allegedly conspired to restrict the 
sale of reinsurance to the American insurance market unless designated terms more favorable to insurers were incorporated into 
standard insurance contracts. Id. at 775-76. The London reinsurers argued that holding them liable under U.S. antitrust law 
would ""conflict significantly with British law,"" and the British Government, appearing as amicus curiae, concurred, asserting that 
""Parliament ha[d] established a comprehensive regulatory regime over the London reinsurance market and that the conduct 
alleged . . . was perfectly consistent with British law and policy."" Id. at 798-99. The Court said this was insufficient to create a 
true conflict: ""The fact that conduct is lawful in the state in which it took place will not, of itself, bar application of the United 
States antitrust laws, even where the foreign state has a strong policy to permit or encourage such conduct."" Id. at 799 (internal 
quotation marks and alteration omitted)."
1450,11," In In re Maxwell, we noted that ""Hartford Fire recognized that other concerns might be implicated if the context were different."" 
93 F.3d at 1050 (internal quotation marks omitted). We then concluded that a dispute over the applicability of the avoidance 
provision of the Bankruptcy Code was ""significantly different from the circumstances confronting the Supreme Court in Hartford 
Fire"" such that a full comity analysis was appropriate, even after finding a true conflict. Id. In our prior opinion, we read Hartford Fire ""narrowly,"" limiting its singular focus on the existence of a true conflict to that case's 
facts and considering the ""remaining factors in the comity balancing test"" even after concluding that a true conflict existed. In re 
Vitamin C Antitrust Litig., 837 F.3d at 185. The Supreme Court did not disturb this portion of our decision, and we maintain that 
approach here. Accord In re Sealed Case, 932 F.3d 915, 931-32, 442 U.S. App. D.C. 378 (D.C. Cir. 2019); see also United 
States v. Brodie, 174 F. Supp. 2d 294, 305 (E.D. Pa. 2001) (""The Supreme Court did not purport [in Hartford Fire] to replace the 
multi-factor analysis of Mannington Mills and other cases.""). "

to entitle defendants to invoke . . . foreign sovereign compulsion[] and international comity."")."
1451,13," Courts have consistently declined to apply FSC absent genuine compulsion by the foreign sovereign. For example, the FSC 
defense was unavailable to American banks that induced Mexican officials in 1919 to grant them tax preferences and a 
commercial monopoly over sisal because, while the restraints on trade were ""aided by discriminating legislation,"" the 
conspirators ""by their own deliberate acts . . . brought about forbidden results within the United States."" United States v. Sisal 
Sales Corp., 274 U.S. 268, 276, 47 S. Ct. 592, 71 L. Ed. 1042 (1927). Similarly, FSC did not shield from antitrust liability 
companies who monopolized vanadium supply and fixed prices in Canada and the United States from 1933 to 1949 where there 
was ""no indication that the [Canadian Government Metals] Controller or any other official within the structure of the Canadian 
Government approved or would have approved of joint efforts to monopolize the production and sale of vanadium or directed 
that purchases from [the plaintiff] be stopped."" Cont'l Ore Co., 370 U.S. at 706. The fact that one defendant, appointed by the 
Canadian government to be exclusive wartime purchasing agent for vanadium, ""was acting in a manner permitted by Canadian 
law"" did not establish a basis for FSC, as there was ""nothing to indicate that such law in any way compelled discriminatory 
purchasing."" Id. at 707."

1452,17," Rule 44.1 provides that ""[i]n determining foreign law, the court may consider any relevant material or source, including 
testimony, whether or not submitted by a party or admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence."" As the Supreme Court 
noted, ""Rule 44.1 frees courts 'to reexamine and amplify material . . . presented by counsel in partisan fashion or in insufficient 
detail.'"" Animal Sci. Prods., 138 S. Ct. at 1873 (quoting the Advisory Committee's Note on Rule 44.1's adoption in 1966). The 
Rule 44.1 materials relevant to this case—which we explore in detail in the remainder of this Section—include the Chinese 
regulations at issue, the charters of the Chinese agencies responsible for overseeing the export regime, internal industry records 
and trial testimony describing how that regime actually functioned, the Ministry's statements interpreting Chinese law, and 
China's representations to the World Trade Organization concerning its export controls on Vitamin C. "
1453,18," Pursuant to the Measures for Administration over Foreign Trade and Economic Social Organizations promulgated in 1991 (the 
""1991 Regime""), the Ministry oversaw the establishment of chambers dedicated to protecting Chinese national interests, 
including ""the development of foreign trade and economy, the enhancement of the relationship between domestic and foreign 
enterprises and relevant organizations, and the order of foreign trade and economy."" App'x 3713-14."
1453,19," Pursuant to the 1997 Notice, the Sub-Committee would hold regular meetings at which the Vitamin C firms would be expected 
to ""timely formulate and adjust export coordination price"" using a ""specific method for coordination . . . formulated by the 
Chamber, and filed to [the Ministry] for record."" Sp. App'x 299. All licensed Vitamin C exporters would be required to participate 
in the Sub-Committee and ""strictly implement"" its ""coordination"" of ""Vitamin C export market, price and customers."" Id. Any 
exporter selling Vitamin C at a below-coordination price would be penalized by reduction of its export quota or revocation of its 
export rights."

1454,22," Id. (quoting World Trade Organization, Statement by the Head of the Chinese Delegation on the Transitional Review of China 
by the [**22]  Council for Trade and Goods, G/C/W/441 (2002))."
1454,23," A ""chop"" is a seal recognized by Chinese customs officials indicating that an export contract or shipment conforms to the 
relevant rules and regulations."
1454,24," Later, in a 2003 Announcement, the Ministry explained that the PVC system involved three steps:"
1454,1, . Exporters deliver contracts to the chambers for verification.
1454,2," . The chambers verify based on (i) industry-wide price agreements (filed with the Ministry) and (ii) relevant regulations of 
the Ministry and Customs. The chambers must affix a chop only to conforming export contracts."
1454,3," . Exporters declare to Customs with a chop on export forms and contracts. SPA. 310-11. According to the 2003 Announcement, the chambers would treat PVC applications from exporters who were not 
members of the relevant chamber the same as PVC applications from those of chamber members. SPA. 311. "
1455,25," While the district court reached the opposite conclusion based on (1) the apparent spottiness of enforcement during a specific 
period; (2) its surmise that the available sanctions were not sufficiently severe; and (3) the inference that the defendants were 
acting in their economic interest and thus did not need to be compelled, we find these issues largely beside the point because, 
as explained in Section III.B, infra, our decision is based on the prima facie conflict between U.S. law and Chinese law rather 
than the degree of compulsion defendants faced. "
1456,26," We note that the U.S. Trade Representative reported similar findings to Congress in December 2003, concluding that ""China 
maintains price controls on several products and services . . . in the form of either absolute mandated prices or specific pricing 
policy guidelines as directed by the government."" App'x 1427. The Trade Representative reached the same conclusions in 2004 
and 2006."
1456,27," The 2003 Notice from the Chamber did not include an agreed price for Vitamin C. But the Chamber clearly established 
minimum prices to which its members adhered. If a contract price term fell below the minimum price, the 2003 Notice instructed 
firms to ""voluntarily convert the price term to be consistent with the agreed price term."" 1:06-md-1738, Doc. 397-22 at 13."
1456,28," One of Jiangshan's executives, Wang Qi, testified that his company was ""free to decide about prices above $3.35 [per 
kilogram] when that was the minimum price,"" and that ""no one outside"" the company ""ordered"" them to ""charge prices higher 
than $3.35."" App'x 1709-10. The dissent concludes from this evidence that colluding on prices above $3.35 per kilogram ""was 
the defendants' choice, not their legal obligation."" Dissent at 7. But Qi testified unambiguously that, throughout the relevant 
period, his company ""communicated with other Chinese Vitamin C companies about increasing Vitamin C prices."" App'x 1687. 
No one had to order Qi or Jiangshan to charge higher prices. The Chinese government's legal mandate was for Jiangshan and 
the other defendants, operating through the Chamber and its Sub-Committee, ""to coordinate export price."" Sp. App'x 302. "
1457,29," China's embassy in Washington, DC, also sent a diplomatic note to the U.S. Department of State on April 9, 2014, requesting 
that it be permitted to join the Ministry in filing an amicus brief in our Court. See Diplomatic Note No. CE027/14 from the 
Embassy of the People's Republic of China to the State Department, Supreme Court J. App'x 782-83. ""Diplomatic notes are 
used for correspondence between the U.S. Government and a foreign government. The Secretary of State corresponds with the 
diplomatic representatives of foreign governments at Washington, DC, U.S. embassies abroad, and foreign offices or ministries."" 
United States Department of State, 5 Foreign Affairs Handbook 1 H-611(a). The Ministry filed its amicus brief in our Court on 
April 14, 2014. The Department of State has not filed a corresponding amicus brief. "
1458,30," The Amicus Brief argued that dismissal was warranted under the foreign sovereign compulsion doctrine because the 
anticompetitive conduct was compelled and under principles of international comity because of the ""irreconcilable conflict 
between the requirements of U.S. antitrust law and the laws and policies of China."" App'x 167-71, 173-75."
1458,31," To explain how such price coordination worked in practice, the Amicus Brief canvassed the evolution of China's system of 
export controls, beginning with the 1991 Regime and concluding with the 2003 Announcement. The brief noted that the 
defendants were compelled to become participating members of the Sub-Committee and to implement its price coordination 
responsibilities. In describing previous regulatory phases such as the 1991 Regime and the 1997 Notice, the Amicus Brief 
sometimes used the present tense in ways that conveyed the impression that defunct regulations were still in effect. See, e.g., 
App'x at 159 (""The Ministry's authority over the Chamber is plenary . . . ."" (citing regulation from the 1991 Regime)); id. at 159-60 
(""The Sub-Committee . . . is responsible for 'coordinating the Vitamin C export market, price and customers . . . .'"" (quoting the 
Sub-Committee's 1998 Notice of Establishment)); id. at 167 (""Government entities policed defendants' compliance with the 
resulting prices and volume limits, and non-compliance would subject defendants to severe penalties . . . ."") (citing the 1997 
Notice and the 1998 Sub-Committee Charter alongside the 2002 Notice)). Yet the Amicus Brief stated clearly that the 2002 
Notice ""changed the way in which compliance with the Chamber's 'coordination' was confirmed by abolishing the [1997 Notice] 
and establishing a [PVC] system,"" which the brief identified as governing ""throughout the Relevant Period."" Id. at 164-65."
1458,32," In particular, the 2008 Statement emphasized that the Ministry authorized and supervised the Chamber in performing the 
governmental function of ""regulating, through consultation, the price of Vitamin C manufactured for export from China so as to 
maintain an orderly export."" Id. The 2008 Statement contended that the plaintiffs' claims—which implicated the Ministry's direct 
administration of Vitamin C exports—should be addressed through diplomatic engagement rather than litigation. "
1459,33," In particular, the Ministry's position on compulsion appears vulnerable with respect to the framework for the defendants' 
arrangement of actual market prices, often considerably in excess of the Chamber-mandated minimum price of $3.35 per 
kilogram. As we have explained, the PVC regime's enforcement scheme appears to have required only the latter price, whereas 
a consultative process among Chinese exporters yielded the additional price and volume coordination. Such coordination, while 
still clearly mandated by the Chinese government, does not appear to have been enforced with the ""chop"" in the same manner 
as the minimum price."
1459,34," See App'x 175 (""Insofar as China's sovereign policy decisions about how best to manage its economic transformation conflict 
with the policies embodied in U.S. antitrust laws, that conflict should be addressed 'through diplomatic channels,' and not 
through 'the unnecessary irritant of a private antitrust action.'"" (quoting O.N.E. Shipping, 830 F.2d at 454)); id. at 206 (""[T]he 
Chinese government respectfully submits that, to the extent the plaintiffs take issue with the Chinese government's sovereign 
actions over the conduct solely of its own citizens, that issue should not be addressed in the courts of the United States but 
rather through bilateral trade negotiations conducted by the executive branches of the respective sovereign nations involved 
consistent with recognized norms of international law and diplomacy.""); id. at 653 (""China understands and believes that virtually 
all sovereign nations and regions (including the United States), proceeding from their own interests, have exercised various 
forms of government regulations over part of their private sector and certain industries. China's export regulations of Vitamin C at 
issue in this case are no different."")."
1459,35," See ELIZABETH C. ECONOMY, THE THIRD REVOLUTION (2018); RICHARD MACGREGOR, THE PARTY (2d ed. 2013); see generally JOHN 
K. FAIRBANK & MERLE GOLDMAN, CHINA: A NEW HISTORY (2d ed. 2006). "
1461,36," Our prior opinion deferred to the Ministry's submissions in finding that (1) vitamin C exporters were required to negotiate and 
agree upon an ""industry-wide negotiated"" price; (2) terms like ""industry self-discipline"" and ""voluntary restraint"" referred to the 
Chinese government's expectation that private firms engage in self-regulation with respect to agreed prices and quotas; and (3) 
such participation was mandatory even for non-members of the Sub-Committee. 837 F.3d at 190 & n.9. On remand, we have reached the first conclusion on the basis of the regulations themselves, as illuminated by 
contemporaneous industry records and trial testimony concerning the PVC regime. Because our analysis turns on the existence 
of a true conflict, we reach this conclusion in light of what Chinese law facially required rather than the Chinese regulatory 
program's track record of enforcement. Thus, we find a true conflict even though the defendants did not always reach or adhere 
to a coordinated market price. On the second point, we find the Ministry's submissions worthy of deference, after careful consideration, insofar as they explain 
terms of art that are otherwise vague. See, e.g., Sp. App'x 302 (Sub-Committee expected to ""coordinate export price and 
industry self-discipline"" to ""assist in maintaining good export order""); 1:06-md-1738, Doc. 397-22 at 12 (an entity with contract 
price term below the minimum agreed export price is expected to ""voluntarily convert the price term to be consistent with the 
agreed price term""). We address the third point next, in the text."
1461,37," See App'x 698 (""By the end of 2001, 21 companies remained in the vitamin C export business, of which four were 
manufacturers and the remainder were trading companies."")."
1461,38," See THE EAGLES, HOTEL CALIFORNIA (Asylum Records, 1976); see also App'x 685, 701 (Sub-Committee Secretary General Haili 
described in his affidavit how, even after the 2002 reforms, ""as a practical matter, no manufacturer could abandon participation 
in the Sub-Committee or the meetings that the Chamber called.""). "
1462,39," We have condensed these factors somewhat and have omitted one factor—regarding the existence of an international treaty 
on point—which is not relevant here."
1462,40," Notably, Article 276 of the Civil Procedure Law of the People's Republic of China (2017) provides that ""[i]f any matter in which 
a foreign court requests assistance would harm the sovereignty, security or public interest of the People's Republic of China, the 
[Chinese] court shall refuse to comply with the request."" Similarly, Article 282 forbids Chinese courts from executing any foreign 
judgment which ""contradicts the basic principles of the law of the People's Republic of China or violates State sovereignty, 
security or the public interest."""
1462,41," There was litigation of a similar case in the Third Circuit, but that Court of Appeals did not have occasion to reach the issues 
we address in today's decision. See Animal Sci. Prods., Inc. v. China Nat. Metals & Mins. Imp. & Exp. Corp., 702 F. Supp. 2d 
320 (D.N.J. 2010), vacated and remanded sub nom. Animal Sci. Prods., Inc. v. China Minmetals Corp., 654 F.3d 462 (3d Cir. 
2011), as amended (Oct. 7, 2011). "
1463,42," See App'x 175 (respecting ""China's sovereign policy decisions about how best to manage its economic transformation""); id. at 
206-07 (respecting ""Chinese government's sovereign actions over the conduct solely of its own citizens""); id. at 653 (respecting 
""China's export regulations of Vitamin C at issue in this case"")."
1463,43," This should come as no surprise, as the Department of State generally ""adheres to a policy that it does not take positions 
regarding, or participate in, litigation between private parties, unless required to do so by applicable law."" Société Nationale 
Industrielle Aérospatiale, 482 U.S. at 554 n.5 (Blackmun, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). "
1464,44," Defendants relied on two other closely related doctrines in defense of their conduct abroad, act of state and foreign sovereign 
compulsion, but we find it unnecessary to reach a decision as to the applicability of either doctrine in light of our international 
comity holding. As to the act of state doctrine, because our analysis is centered on whether defendants were required under Chinese law to 
engage in anticompetitive conduct, we are concerned with whether China's regulatory regime was responsible for that conduct, 
not whether such a Chinese governmental mandate (if there was one) would itself be legal or valid. Accordingly, ""the factual 
predicate for application of the act of state doctrine does not exist"" here because ""[n]othing in the present suit requires the Court 
to declare invalid, and thus ineffective as a rule of decision for the courts of this country the official act of a foreign sovereign."" 
W.S. Kirkpatrick, 493 U.S. at 405 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We are thus not called upon to express any 
view about the legality — under Chinese or international law — of the vitamin C export regime that the Chinese government 
implemented. Nor, by taking into account the Ministry's submissions to the district court, this Court, and the Supreme Court 
concerning the nature of Chinese law, do we sit in judgment of any official act of the Chinese government in formulating or 
transmitting those submissions. We merely afford those submissions careful consideration (but not conclusive deference) as we 
reach our conclusions about the reach of the U.S. antitrust law. As to foreign sovereign compulsion, we might be inclined to the view that Chinese law compelled at least part of the defendants' 
anticompetitive conduct with sufficient coercive force to trigger this doctrine. But there is good reason to proceed with caution in 
such a high-stakes arena fraught with uncertainty. To conclude that this action merits dismissal on foreign sovereign compulsion 
grounds, we would be required to predict the severity of sanctions defendants might have faced in China for noncompliance, as 
well as pass on whether the defendants acted in bad faith—or simply had no alternative—given that they did not petition 
Chinese authorities to harmonize their vitamin C export regime with U.S. antitrust law. Yet we need not reach these vexed 
questions because international comity provides ample basis for declining to apply U.S. antitrust law to defendants' conduct in 
this case."
1464,45," See O.N.E. Shipping, 830 F.2d at 453 (affirming dismissal of complaint for reasons of international comity where foreign 
sovereign's cargo reservation laws ""were alleged to be at the core of"" the anticompetitive harm)."
1464,46," While the Office of the Solicitor General filed a brief in support of plaintiffs' petition for certiorari in the Supreme Court, that brief 
primarily addressed the question of what level of deference U.S. courts should extend to a foreign sovereign's statement of its 
own law. See Brief for the United States as Amicus Curiae Supporting Petitioners, 138 S. Ct. 1865 (No. 16-1220), at 12-29. As 
the dissent observes, see Dissent at 9 n.4, the Solicitor General criticized our prior opinion in passing for giving ""inadequate 
weight to the interests of the U.S. victims of the alleged price-fixing cartel and to the interests of the United States in 
enforcement of its antitrust laws,"" and ""too much weight to China's objections to this suit,"" Brief for the United States at 20. But it 
is the Legal Adviser of the Department of State who expresses the Executive Branch's view on internationally significant cases 
and their ramifications for foreign relations. See, e.g., Khulumani v. Barclay Nat. Bank Ltd., 504 F.3d 254, 296 (2d Cir. 2007) 
(Korman, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). The Solicitor General's brief neither claimed to report the views of the 
Executive Branch or the Department of State in this respect, nor otherwise purported to represent that a decision one way or the 
other in this case might have any particular effect on foreign relations. "
1465,1," The majority concludes that ""[a]ffording some deference to the Ministry's submissions . . . the 2002 Notice mandated the 
defendants to engage in price-fixing regardless of whether they remained [Subcommittee] members."" Maj. Op. at 54-55. "
1466,," However, the Ministry did not argue vitamin C exporters who were not members of the Subcommittee still needed to coordinate 
prices. In fact, both the Ministry and the majority emphasize that price coordination occurred through the Vitamin C 
Subcommittee. See, e.g., App'x 159 (Ministry's 2006 amicus brief) (""Throughout the [r]elevant [p]eriod, the Chamber exercised 
its regulatory authority with respect to vitamin C exports through its Vitamin C [Subcommittee].""); Maj. Op. at 31 (""[T]he Chamber 
delegated authority by administrative rule to the [Subcommittee] to 'coordinate and guide vitamin C import and export business 
as well as relevant activities.'"") (citation omitted). "
1467,2," Indeed, if not for the PVC regime--instituted by the 2002 Notice and equated with ""Chinese law"" during the relevant period by 
the Ministry and defendants--it is unclear what ""material or source"" establishes that Chinese law required the defendants to fix 
prices above the minimum. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 44.1."
1467,3," Some scholars have raised concerns regarding the ten-factor balancing test applied by the majority to determine the 
extraterritorial reach of a federal statue, arguing that the Supreme Court has rejected this approach as unworkable. See Brief for 
Professors of International Litigation as Amici Curiae Supporting Neither Party, Animal Sci. Prods., 138 S. Ct. 1865 (No. 16-
1220), at 11-13. For my purpose here, I do not address whether the multi-factor balancing test should not be applied at all."
1467,4," Because I find there is no true conflict, I do not address the remaining comity factors. However, I note that the majority's 
analysis, which is very similar to our 2016 decision, was criticized by the Solicitor General ""express[ing] the views of the United 
States"" in its amicus brief in support of the second question presented in the plaintiffs' petition for a writ of certiorari to the "
1468,," Supreme Court. Brief for U.S. Gov't as Amicus Curiae, Animal Sci. Prods., 138 S. Ct. 1865 (No. 16-1220), at 1. The government 
remarked that we ""gave inadequate weight to the interests of the U.S. victims of the alleged price-fixing cartel and to the 
interests of the United States in enforcement of its antitrust laws"" and ""gave too much weight to China's objections to this suit."" 
Id. at 20. Instead, the government suggested ""under the circumstances presented here, [defendants'] argument that Chinese law 
required them to engage in the challenged conduct might have been better analyzed under the rubric of the foreign sovereign 
compulsion doctrine rather than through a comity analysis."" Id."
1468,5," Even if Chinese law required the defendants to agree on a minimum price, which I do not find, comity would not demand 
dismissal of the entire case. At the very least, I would vacate and remand for the district court to calculate damages based on 
prices that were above the minimum. See Appellees' Br. at 10 n.9 (explaining that ""[p]laintiffs' damages expert 'calculated 
damages under the assumption that the Chinese government would have enforced a rigid price floor of $3.35 per kilogram'"")

1497,4, This agreement in principle was later memorialized in the proposed Ninth Amendment to the AOS. 
1498,5," Notably, Philmont Club was appraised in 2003 at $10.6 million solely as a country club (i.e., this figure did not take into account 
the possibility of selling the Property for development purposes). (Id. at ¶ 150.) Here, CGP promised PCC $10 million in debt 
payoff and capital improvements, meaning that ""CGP's offer [in 2016] was not far removed from the appraised value of Philmont 
Club [in 2003]."" (Id. at ¶¶ 150, 152.) NPT alleges that this shows that ""Philmont Club was worth many millions of dollars more 
than what it was sold . . . for."" (Id. at ¶ 151.) "
1499,6, Ridgewood Philmont is an entity created by Ridgewood for the purpose of entering into the DSA. (Id. at ¶ 120.) 
1500,7," Freestone Capital Management is the company responsible for managing the various entities that provided the financing for 
Concert Philmont's purchase of Philmont Club. (Doc. No. 1 at ¶ 132.) "
1503,8," To that end, PCC remained completely unaware that Ridgewood and CGP had even been communicating since September 
2016. (Id. at ¶ 168.) Ridgewood and CGP never informed PCC of this fact, ""much less that they had been working together to 
acquire Philmont Club and develop the Property since October 2016 at the latest."" (Id.) In fact, Meyer first learned that 
Ridgewood and CGP had ""teamed up on the development of the Property"" during his deposition on July 25, 2018. (Id. at ¶ 169.) "
1505,9," Specifically, NPT alleges that, just days after signing the confidentiality agreement, Ridgewood transmitted PCC's financial 
information to ClubCorp and to Morningstar Golf & Hospitality, LLC. (Id. at ¶¶ 183-86.) "
1511,10," During oral argument, Plaintiff's counsel—for the very first time—attempted to distinguish between the two antitrust claims, 
arguing that they were premised on different per se violations. Specifically, counsel contended that the antitrust claim NPT 
brought as PCC's assignee was based on bid-rigging, while the antitrust claim NPT brought directly was based on illegal 
boycotting. (See, e.g., Hr'g Tr. at 43:2-20, 57:7-22.) Any mention of illegal boycotting is conspicuously absent from the 
voluminous briefing done on this motion. (See Doc. Nos. 17 & 22.) As a result, the Court finds that Plaintiff waived its illegal 
boycotting argument. See Tomasko v. Iran H. Weinstock, P.C., 357 F. App'x 472, 479 (3d Cir. 2009) (finding that ""the specific 
objections that Weinstock raised for the first time at oral argument in the District Court have been waived""); In re Corio, 371 F. 
App'x 352, 355 (3d Cir. 2010) (finding that the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion when it refused to consider an 
argument raised for the first time during oral argument); Doherty v. Allstate Indem. Co., Civ. A. No. 15-05165, 2017 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 52795, 2017 WL 1283942, at *23 (E.D. Pa. Apr. 6, 2017) (""[B]ecause this argument was asserted for the first time in 
Doherty's reply and at oral argument, it is waived.""); McCowan v. City of Philadelphia, Civil Action No. 2:19-cv-03326-KSM, 2020

time referred to the subpoena as a 'deep sea fishing' expedition . . . The Court does not consider Defendants' relevancy 
argument, which was raised for the first time at oral argument[.]""). "
1512,11," In its sur-reply, NPT argues that it is ""illogical"" to focus this narrowly on semantics. (See Doc. No. 22 at pp. 3-4.) But NPT fails 
to cite to any case law to support its argument that Defendants were engaged in a bidding contest given the facts at play here or 
that an ""offer"" versus a ""bid"" is a distinction without a difference. "
1515,12," In their reply brief and during oral argument, Defendants argued that the Court should dismiss the state law claims for lack of 
supplemental jurisdiction. (See Doc. No. 21 at pp. 11-12; Hr'g Tr. at 15:4-7.) Defendants are wrong. NPT has pled facts showing 
that the Court can properly exercise diversity jurisdiction over this case. (See, e.g., Doc. No. 1 at ¶¶ 2, 4-27; accord Hr'g Tr. at 
82:19-83:1.) "

] Under Pennsylvania law, ""[t]he parol evidence rule forbids admitting evidence of prior representations to fully integrated written agreements, even for claims of fraudulent inducement."" Berardine v. Weiner, 198 F. Supp. 3d 439, 444 (E.D. 
Pa. 2016). ""Fraud in the inducement does not involve terms omitted from an agreement, but rather allegations of oral 
representations on which the other party relied in entering into the agreement but which are contrary to the express terms of the 
agreement."" Id. Here, the complaint alleges that the CGP and Nanula committed fraud in the inducement by, inter alia, falsely 
representing that obtaining development approvals would be risky and that it would maintain 27 holes of golf—statements PCC 
then relied on in agreeing to enter into the PSA. (See generally Doc. No. 1.) "
1519,14," The fact that PCC had amended its AOS with NPT eight times (and proposed a ninth amendment) underscores the fact that it 
is a sophisticated business entity."
1519,15," HN21[
] In Morton's Restaurant Group, Inc. v. Charest, the court stated that even if a confidential or fiduciary relationship did 
not exist, ""there may still be a heightened responsibility based on the dealings of the parties."" 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17294, 
1998 WL 767444, at *5 (""Thus, one may justifiably rely on silence where there is no confidential relationship only if a specific 
relationship of trust has been developed with regard to a certain matter.""). As in Morton's, NPT fails to allege that ""a specific 
relationship of trust developed"" between PCC and Defendants to give rise to a duty to speak."
1519,16," The sole case NPT relies on applies New York law and is inapposite. See Zaccaro v. Shah, 746 F. Supp. 2d 508, 520, 522 
(S.D.N.Y. 2010) (""Under New York law, Shah, possessed a superior knowledge not readily available to Zaccaro as to the REIT's 
interest in purchasing AHA, had a duty to disclose that knowledge to Zaccaro to correct his mistaken belief that the REIT was 
not interested in purchasing AHA, particularly in view of Shah's prior statement that the REIT was not interest [sic] in purchasing 
the Hotel."" (emphasis added)). "
1521,17," (See also Doc. No. 1-4, Ex. 35 at p. 114 (""The wild ideas the Board has about a 'master plan for the North Course are 
probably way overblown, and we have huge capital needs in the clubhouse, HVAC, etc. You will see. We will want to 'nod' to 
some master plan elements so the members are excited about their North Course being updated a bit, but we want to spend the 
smallest dollars possible to get the maximum member impact.""); Doc. No. 1-4, Ex. 36 at p. 118 (complimenting CGP's counsel 
for the ""nicely vague"" language in the PSA about the capital improvement projects CGP would undertake).)"
1521,18," Notably, in its response brief, NPT fails to cite to a single case to support its contention that PCC justifiably relied on 
Defendants' misrepresentations. (See Doc. No. 17 at pp. 34-35.) "
1522,19," In that vein, the complaint indicates that PCC knew by September 2016, that the Township was inclined to grant approval if 
certain conditions were met when NVR, NPT, and PCC were negotiating an amendment to the LPA and the proposed ninth 
amendment to the AOS. According to Plaintiff, NPT had extensive discussions with the Township to determine what 
development plans the Township would find favorable, including making a $1 million donation to the Township for roadway 
improvements and making the development age-restricted—the very same conditions that provided the basis for the eventual 
deal between CGP and PCC, the deal that CGP and Ridgewood indicated that the Township was enthusiastic about. "
1523,20," Plaintiff alleges that it justifiably relied on Ridgewood's representations because ""Ridgewood is a professional real estate 
developer who purports to be knowledgeable in such matters."" (Doc. No. 1 at ¶ 236; see also id. at ¶ 295 (claiming that PCC 
justifiably relied on Ridgewood representations because ""Ridgewood represented itself as a professional real estate developer 
knowledgeable in development matters""). However, Plaintiff fails to cite to any case law indicating that a defendant's expertise or 
professional knowledge is, without more, sufficient to establish justifiable reliance, particularly when both sides to the 
negotiations are sophisticated business entities. Therefore, even when taking all allegations in the light most favorable to 
Plaintiff, we cannot find that PCC justifiably relied on Defendants' representations. "
1524,21," Nor do the exhibits on which NPT relies to show that CGP misrepresented the nature of the capital improvement projects it 
would undertake support NPT's argument. (See Doc. No. 1-4, Ex. 35 at pp. 114 (internal CGP email that did not include Grebow 
or Plotnick); Doc. No. 1-4, Ex. 36, at pp. 116-18 (email between CGP employees and CGP's counsel).) "
1526,22," Because the Court finds that NPT failed to plead malice, the Court does not address Defendants' alternative argument—that 
NPT also failed to allege an underlying tort claim to support the civil conspiracy claim. However, the Court notes that the only 
remaining claim that could plausibly support the civil conspiracy claim is the fraud claim against CGP, to the extent it is based on 
the alleged misrepresentation that CGP would make $5 million in capital improvements. "
1530,1," Excluded from the Class are Defendants, the officers and directors of Lannett, at all relevant times, members of their immediate 
families and their legal representatives, heirs, successors or assigns and any entity in which Defendants have or had a 
controlling interest. "
1531,2," In addition to these and the Section 20(a) claims, the Complaint also asserts that Defendants violated Subsections (a) and (c) 
of Rule 10b-5, which respectively make it unlawful to ""employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud"" and ""engage in any act, 
practice, or course of business which operates . . . as a fraud."" 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5(a), (c). Claims under these subsections 
are referred to as ""'scheme liability claims' because they make deceptive conduct actionable, as opposed to Rule 10b-5(b), 
which relates to deceptive statements."" In re DVI, Inc. Sec. Litig., 639 F.3d 623, 643 n.29 (3d Cir. 2011), abrogated on other 
grounds by Amgen, 568 U.S. at 465. Plaintiffs' Motion and briefing in support of their Motion do not raise the scheme liability 
claim of the Complaint for class certification. Accordingly, this claim will not be certified for class treatment. "
1532,3," Rule 23(g) provides that ""a court that certifies a class must appoint class counsel,"" and sets out a non-exhaustive list of factors 
governing the appointment of class counsel, including: (1) ""the work counsel has done in identifying or investigating potential 
claims in the action""; (2) ""counsel's experience in handling class actions, other complex litigation, and the types of claims 
asserted in the action""; (3) ""counsel's knowledge of the applicable law""; and, (4) ""the resources that counsel will commit to 
representing the class."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(g)(1). For the reasons set forth above, Abraham, Fruchter & Twersky, LLP, satisfies 
the criteria of Rule 23(g), and will be appointed class counsel."
1532,4," Defendants contend that adequacy is not established because both UPRRS and Ironworkers ""lack even a basic understanding 
of the facts underlying this action"" and defer to counsel in making decisions about the case. But, ""[a] class representative need 
only possess a minimal degree of knowledge necessary to meet the adequacy standard."" New Directions Treatment Servs. v. 
City of Reading, 490 F.3d 293, 313 (3d Cir. 2007) (quotation marks and citation omitted). The deposition testimony of Plaintiffs' 
designated Rule 30(b)(6) witnesses demonstrate that Plaintiffs understand the nature of their causes of action - to wit, that this is 
a class action lawsuit against Lannett and its executives premised on their false and misleading statements about drug pricing 
which caused investors, including Plaintiffs and class members, to lose money. There is no need for Plaintiffs to have mastered 
the factual and legal issues presented in the case to satisfy the adequacy requirement, because their representation of the class 
will be accomplished through adequate counsel. See, e.g., Lewis v. Curtis, 671 F.2d 779, 789 (3d Cir. 1982), abrogated on other "
1533,," grounds by Kamen v. Kemper Fin. Servs., Inc., 500 U.S. 90, 111 S. Ct. 1711, 114 L. Ed. 2d 152 (1991); see also In re Suboxone 
(Buprenorphine Hydrochlorine & Naloxone) Antitrust Litig., 967 F.3d 264, 273 (3d Cir. 2020)."
1533,5," Defendants also contest adequacy on the grounds that UPRRS is underfunded, arguing that UPRRS's ""precarious financial 
position raises serious concerns about potential conflicts of interest and whether it could represent the putative class if it is 
forced to declare bankruptcy or faces an immediate liquidity crunch."" To preclude class certification, a conflict of interest ""must 
be fundamental"" and cannot be ""unduly speculative."" Dewey v. Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft, 681 F.3d 170, 184 (3d Cir. 2012) 
(quotation marks and citations omitted). ""A fundamental conflict exists where some class members claim to have been harmed 
by the same conduct that benefitted other members of the class"" and ""touches the specific issues in controversy."" Id. (quotation 
marks, brackets, and citations omitted). Although Defendants suggest that UPRRS's financial status could pressure UPRRS to 
settle the case, this does not constitute a fundamental conflict as the Third Circuit has defined it. Further, UPRRS has vigorously 
litigated the case since its appointment as lead plaintiff over four years ago. Potential adverse consequences of UPRRS's 
financial situation are speculative, and do not render UPRRS inadequate."
1533,6," One focus of the typicality inquiry is ""the extent to which the proposed representative may face significant unique or atypical 
defenses to her claims."" Id. at 597-98 (citation omitted). Even where a proposed class representative's claims are the same as 
those of class members, its individual factual circumstances may allow a defendant to assert a unique or atypical defense to the 
proposed representative's claims - that is, a ""defense[] against it which would not be applicable to the class as a whole."" Zenith 
Lab'ys, Inc. v. Carter-Wallace, Inc., 530 F.2d 508, 512 (3d Cir. 1976). If the proposed representative faces a defense that is 
unique to them, ""the representative's interests might not be aligned with those of the class, and the representative might devote 
time and effort to the defense at the expense of issues that are common and controlling for the class."" Schering Plough, 589 
F.3d at 598 (quotation marks and citation omitted). "
1535,7," To invoke the Basic presumption of reliance, ""a plaintiff must prove that: (1) the alleged misrepresentations were publicly 
known, (2) they were material, (3) the stock traded in an efficient market, and (4) the plaintiff traded the stock between when the 
misrepresentations were made and when the truth was revealed."" Id. at 277-78 (citations omitted). Plaintiffs need not 
demonstrate materiality to establish that the fraud-on-the-market theory applies at class certification. Amgen, 568 U.S. at 459-
60. Here, as to the remaining elements, Plaintiffs allege misrepresentations that were publicly known, including in public 
regulatory filings, press releases, and public statements, Plaintiffs purchased stock during the class period, and Lannett's 
common stock traded on a quintessential efficient market, the New York Stock Exchange. See Oran v. Stafford, 226 F.3d 275, 
282 (3d Cir. 2000) (""[I]n an open and developed securities market like the New York Stock Exchange, the price of a company's 
stock is determined by all available material information regarding the company and its business""). Plaintiffs thus have satisfied 
the pre-requisites required to establish that the Basic presumption of reliance applies for purposes of class certification. "
1536,8," Porter testified that TSW has a ""value shop"" investment approach and tries ""to buy companies for some value below their 
intrinsic value and hopefully sell them at their intrinsic value or above."" As to TSW's purchase of Lannett stock, Porter testified "
1537,," that TSW ""took a position in Lannett . . . thinking that [it] had a favorable risk/reward relationship,"" explaining further that Lannett 
had ""large cash position, a backlog of generic drugs that hadn't been approved yet, the opportunity to deploy their balance sheet 
for M&A opportunities,"" and other opportunities. As to potential ""negatives"" in investing in Lannett, Porter agreed that ""one of the 
primary risks"" included ""price erosion"" in the pricing of generic drugs."
1537,9," Further, the testimony cited by Defendants fails to establish that TSW did not directly rely on the misrepresentations of the 
individual defendants alleged in the Complaint. In this testimony, when asked if TSW ""generally"" relied on what Bedrosian said 
about Lannett, Porter testified that he ""wouldn't say we rely"" because ""we really rely on ourselves"" by ""collect[ing] information"" 
and ""form[ing] our own risk/reward analysis."" Porter then explained that TSW ""listen[s]"" to ""management's discussions about 
risks and opportunities"" and ""factor that into our case."" In other words, Porter confirmed that companies' management's 
statements are a factor in TSW's decision to trade in a security. "
1540,10," The Complaint does, at points, mention Lannett's potential involvement in anticompetitive conduct. However, to the extent that 
Plaintiffs' Complaint might have espoused a theory of liability that Lannett concealed its own involvement in anticompetitive 
conduct, this Court's May 15, 2019 Opinion put paid to that theory. See Utesch v. Lannett Co., Inc., 385 F.Supp.3d 408, 417 n.4 
(E.D. Pa. 2019) (""Defendants' arguments as to this theory [went] without response from Plaintiffs, and therefore the theory [was] 
waived""). "
1543,11," But this suggestion is directly contradicted by (1) other portions of their briefing in which they argue that ""the Coffman Report 
demonstrates that damages in this action are capable of being calculated on a class-wide basis using the out-of-pocket 
damages methodology""; and, (2) that they offer no other ""evidentiary proof"" in support of this proposition."
1543,12," Defendants suggest that Coffman conducted no case-specific analysis in support of his opinion, making much of his testimony 
that the language of the damages section of the Coffman Report was ""language [he'd] used before"" in past cases and that the 
""language describing the out-of-pocket damages methodology and the rationale behind it . . . doesn't change from report to 
report."" That Coffman is a frequent flyer in these kinds of cases in the context of this Daubert motion cuts in favor of his reliability 
rather than against it."
1543,13," Defendants argue that Coffman's opinion is unreliable because he does not propose a damages method, but instead offers 
only a definition of out-of-pocket loss. But he does more than that - he proposes a method of calculating damages on a class-
wide basis. He also summarizes, albeit in general terms, the steps by which out-of-pocket losses would be calculated for the 
class (that is, by quantifying levels of inflation of Lannett's stock during the class period, then performing a ""formulaic"" calculation 
of class members' damages by subtracting the level of inflation of Lannett's stock at the time of each investor's sale from the 
level of inflation at the time of purchase). See also, e.g., 4 Newberg on Class Actions § 12:5 (5th ed.) (listing ""common methods"" 
of proving class-wide damages, including a ""formula derived from the facts of the case that can be applied generally to all class 
members""). "
1544,14," Coffman concedes that Plaintiffs have more work to do to calculate damages using the out-of-pocket method. Specifically, his 
report explains, to calculate the level of inflation of Lannett's stock caused by Defendants' fraud, which is the ""input"" for the out-
of-pocket method, Plaintiffs will have to perform a ""detailed"" analysis ""informed by information learned in discovery."" His report 
identifies multiple frequently-used methods and techniques to calculate artificial inflation and distinguish ""confounding"" sources 
of increases or decreases in a stock price from the impact of an alleged fraud. Although the Report does not identify the specific 
methods or techniques to be deployed here, the method of determining the inflation of Lannett's stock price caused by the 
alleged fraud is common to the class. Moreover, a plaintiff's ""damages model does not need to be exact"" at class certification. In 
re Modafinil Antitrust Litig., 837 F.3d 238, 261 (3d Cir. 2016) (citation omitted). Thus, Coffman need not support his opinion with 
a damages model specifying precisely how Plaintiffs will measure the price impact of the various misrepresentations and 
corrective disclosures alleged here, nor specify exactly how Plaintiffs will distinguish the impact of various other factors to be 
uncovered in discovery that may have affected Lannett's stock price during the class period."
1544,15," Defendants also challenge Coffman's opinion as unreliable and not fitting the case based on an event study model Coffman 
used to assess market efficiency for purposes of determining if the Basic presumption of reliance applies. Because, Defendants 
argue, this event study model can measure only the impact on Lannett's stock price of news specific to Lannett, and not the 
impact of news concerning Lannett's competitors, the event study model cannot support Coffman's damages opinion and does 
not fit the facts of the case. However, this event study is not the basis of Coffman's opinion: the Coffman Report's section on 
damages explicitly states that ""[t]he event study [he] performed for th[e] report is for Market Efficiency purposes and is not an 
attempt at valuing artificial inflation"" of Lannett's stock price. "
1545,16," Further, to the extent that Marietta-Westberg is opining that Plaintiffs will be unable to prove that class members' losses were 
not ""caused by factors other than the revelation of a misrepresentation"" such as ""changed investor expectations, new industry-
specific or firm-specific facts, conditions, or other events,"" this is squarely an issue of loss causation, and Plaintiffs need not 
prove loss causation at class certification. Halliburton I, 563 U.S. at 812-813 (quotation marks and citations omitted). "

1605,1," Plaintiffs' Motion to Certify a Collective Action [#98] and Cultural Care's Motion to Strike Pre-Certification [**4]  Consents [#114] 
are also pending and will be addressed in a separate order. "
1606,2," Cultural Care asks the court to take judicial notice of what it claims is a copy of the State Department brochure. Courts can take 
judicial notice of information from an official government website that is ""not subject to reasonable dispute."" Gent v. CUNA Mut. 
Ins. Soc'y, 611 F.3d 79, 84 n.5 (1st Cir. 2010) (citing Denius v. Dunlap, 330 F.3d 919, 926-27 (7th Cir. 2003)) (taking judicial 
notice of information on the CDC website). The brochure, filed as an exhibit to Cultural Care's motion, appears on a webpage 
with a government domain (https://j1.state.gov) and thus seems to be from a government website. Def's Mem. 9 [#67]. The 
webpage only contains the brochure, so it is not possible to confirm that the brochure is current. Plaintiffs, however, also cite to 
the brochure in their memorandum opposing the motion to dismiss, Pl.'s Mem. 3 n.1 [#78], so it appears they do not contest the 
authenticity of the document. It is therefore appropriate for the court to take judicial notice. See Watterson v. Page, 987 F.2d 1, 3 
(1st Cir. 1993) (""Ordinarily . . . consideration of documents not attached to the complaint . . . is forbidden, unless the proceeding 
is properly converted into one for summary judgment . . . . However, courts have made narrow exceptions for documents the 
authenticity of which are not disputed by the parties . . . ."") (citation omitted); O'Hara v. Diageo-Guinness, USA, Inc., 306 F. 
Supp. 3d 441, 457 (D. Mass. 2018), on reconsideration, 370 F. Supp. 3d 204 (D. Mass. 2019)."
1606,3," Cultural Care asks the court to take judicial notice of two documents, Wolkoff Decl. Exs. B, C [#68], that Cultural Care claims 
are notices issued in 2007 and 2009 by the State Department in which the department calculated the minimum weekly stipend "
1607,," payments owed to au pairs under the federal minimum wage. Def's Mem. 12 [#67]. Plaintiffs reference the notices in their 
memorandum opposing the motion to dismiss and do not contest their authenticity. Pl.'s Mem. 26 [#78]. The court therefore finds 
it appropriate to take judicial notice of both documents. See Watterson, 987 F.2d at 3. "
1610,4," Cultural Care's claim of derivative sovereign immunity as to the FLSA claims fails for the additional reason that the FLSA 
waives sovereign immunity by permitting suits against public agencies. 29 U.S.C. § 216(b) (applying the FLSA's penalties to 
provision to any ""employer""), § 203(d) (defining ""employer"" to include public agencies). Cultural Care says that because au pairs 
are not employed by the State Department it cannot be sued under this provision. Def's Reply Mem. 1-2 [#86]. But Cultural 
Care's argument for derivative sovereign immunity is premised on the idea that it is standing in the shoes of the government by 
acting as a sponsor organization. Def's Mem. 18. [#67]. It cannot then argue that it is not standing in the shoes of the 
government where the government has waived sovereign immunity. "
1635,1," Throughout this ruling, the term ""MLS"" will be used to refer to NAR-affiliated platforms, while independent platforms will be 
described as ""alternative"" or ""private"" listing services or just ""listing services."" "
1641,2," When asked to identify cases supporting its theory of antitrust standing, TAN flagged Judge Katzmann's partial dissent in 
Daniel. But even accepting Judge Katzmann's view of that case, it does not change the analysis here. In Daniel, allowing more 
doctors to join the contested certification program would have incrementally benefited competition insofar as it would have 
increased the supply of certified doctors available to consumers. Id. at 446. But in this case, there is no marginal benefit to 
competition in allowing TAN to operate, because it has designed its platform to exclude the vast majority of competing agents. "
1643,**, The panel unanimously concludes this case is suitable for decision without oral argument. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2). 
1645,*, This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3. 
1659,1," HN1[
] The same standards that apply to a defendant's motion to dismiss a claim asserted by a plaintiff also generally apply 
to a plaintiff's (and counterclaim defendant's) motion to dismiss a counterclaim asserted by a defendant (and counterclaim 
plaintiff). See Unigestion Holding, S.A. v. UPM Tech., Inc., 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 97083, 2016 WL 4033976, at *2 (D. Or. July 
26, 2016). "
1660,2," HIS's three counterclaims are stated in HIS's Answer, Affirmative Defenses, and Counterclaims to Plaintiff's Second Amended 
Complaint. ECF 191. HIS did not use sequentially numbered paragraphs throughout the entirety of that document. Instead, HIS 
sequentially numbered first its paragraphs for its Answer (¶¶ 1-205), did not number its paragraphs for its 19 affirmative 
defenses, and then sequentially numbered its paragraphs for its counterclaims beginning, for a second time, with ¶ 1. In this "
1661,," Opinion and Order, all paragraph citations to HIS's counterclaims in ECF 191 refer to the second set of HIS's sequentially 
numbered paragraphs."
1661,3," The parties know the identity of this customer and have requested that the Court not identify that customer in publicly filed 
documents."
1661,4," In HIS's counterclaims (ECF 191), HIS sometimes refers to the date of the 2019 NDA as June 21, 2019 (see ¶ 46) and 
sometimes refers to its date as June 17, 2019 (see ¶ 102). Based on ECF 77-12 at 9-12, which appears to be a copy of the NDA 
at issue, the Court assumes that the correct date is June 21, 2019. "
1662,5," In its antitrust counterclaims, HIS also alleges that Edwards ""ties"" the sale of its integrated vacuum pump frame systems to 
related products and services (e.g., pumps, abatement systems, and aftermarket services). ECF 191, ¶¶ 26-27. In HIS's 
response to Edwards's motion to dismiss, however, HIS does not mention tying among HIS's recitation of Edwards's allegedly 
anticompetitive acts. Thus, for purposes of the pending motion, the Court will only consider the alleged anticompetitive conduct 
that HIS explicitly discusses in its response. Accord Walsh v. Nevada Dep't of Hum. Res., 471 F.3d 1033, 1037 (9th Cir. 2006) 
(stating that HN9[
] a plaintiff who ""makes a claim"" in a complaint ""but fails to raise the issue in response to a defendant's 
motion to dismiss"" that claim ""has effectively abandoned [that] claim""). "
1663,6," HN11[
] Oregon law is not materially different. See, e.g., Slover v. Or. State Bd. of Clinical Soc. Workers, 144 Or. App. 565,"
1663,570," , 927 P.2d 1098 (1996) (""To state a claim for breach of contract, plaintiff must allege the existence of a contract, its relevant 
terms, plaintiff's full performance and lack of breach[,] and defendant's breach resulting in damage to plaintiff."" (citation and 
quotation marks omitted)). "
1665,7," In addition, HN13[
] for a private plaintiff to recover money damages (indeed, automatic treble damages) in an antitrust action, § 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 15, requires a plaintiff to show causal antitrust injury, which is an ""injury of the type the 
antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flows from that which makes defendants' acts unlawful."" Brunswick Corp. v. 
Pueblo Bowl—O—Mat, Inc., 429 U.S. 477, 489, 97 S. Ct. 690, 50 L. Ed. 2d 701 (1977). "
1666,8," HIS offers this theory only in support of its claim of attempted monopolization, not actual monopolization. See ECF 191, ¶ 43 
(referring to the creation of a ""dangerous probability"" of market dominance, which is an element of attempted monopolization but 
not actual monopolization). Indeed, it is difficult to see how an unaccepted offer could ever satisfy the causal antitrust injury 
requirement needed in a private antitrust claim seeking money damages because an unaccepted offer would not be the ""cause"" 
of any material result in the marketplace. "
1668,9," See n.7, supra."
1668,10," See n.8, supra. "
1670,11," See also n.7, supra (discussing the requirement of causal antitrust injury)."
1670,12," The Ninth Circuit ultimately granted Edison summary judgment, holding that the evidence that Edison interrupted the City's 
service was insufficient to ""lead a rational trier of fact to find for [the City]."" Id. at 1369 (quoting Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. 
Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986))."
1670,13," As previously noted, however, HIS has sufficiently alleged a claim for breach of contract. "
1671,14," The doctrine derives its name from two cases, E. R.R. Presidents Conf. v. Noerr Motor Freight, 365 U.S. 127, 81 S. Ct. 523, 5 
L. Ed. 2d 464 (1961), and United Mine Workers of Am. v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 85 S. Ct. 1585, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626 (1965)."
1671,15," HN28[
] The second circumstance for when litigation might be a sham is ""if the alleged anticompetitive behavior is the filing of a series of lawsuits."" Freeman, 410 F.3d at 1184; cf. Int'l Longshore, 863 F.3d at 1187 (noting that ""[t]wo sham suits cannot 
amount to a whole series of legal proceedings""). The third circumstance may arise ""if the alleged anticompetitive behavior 
consists of making intentional misrepresentations to the court."" Freeman, 410 F.3d at 1184. "
1673,16," Whether Edwards's defeating HIS's motion for summary judgment on Edwards's trade secret claims (if that were to occur) 
would be sufficient to show that those claims were not objectively baseless for purposes of Noerr-Pennington immunity is a 
question that may benefit from further briefing and study at the appropriate time. See generally In re Relafen Antitrust Litig., 346 
F. Supp. 2d 349, 362-64 (D. Mass. 2004) (discussing issue). "
1674,17," See n.16, supra. "
1691,1," €3 million refers to 3 million euros. Though the exchange rate varies, 3 million euros currently equates to about $3.54 million.

1691,2," Defendants appear to argue that the forum-selection clauses don't bind them because Hetronic sued them only after 
terminating the licensing agreements. Our circuit hasn't addressed that issue, but the Supreme Court ""presume[s] as a matter of 
contract interpretation that . . . parties d[o] not intend a pivotal dispute resolution provision to terminate for all purposes upon the 
expiration of [an] agreement."" Litton Fin. Printing Div., a Div. of Litton Bus. Sys., Inc. v. N.L.R.B., 501 U.S. 190, 208, 111 S. Ct. 
2215, 115 L. Ed. 2d 177 (1991). Though Litton related to arbitration clauses in the collective-bargaining context, our sibling 
circuits that have considered this question agree that dispute-resolution clauses generally may be enforced even after an 
agreement is terminated. Silverpop Sys., Inc. v. Leading Mkt. Techs., Inc., 641 F. App'x 849, 857 (11th Cir. 2016) (unpublished) 
(""While contractual obligations may expire upon the termination of a contract, provisions that are structural (e.g., relating to 
remedies and the resolution of disputes) may survive that termination."" (emphasis added) (citations omitted)); U.S. Smoke & Fire 
Curtain, LLC v. Bradley Lomas Electrolok, Ltd., 612 F. App'x 671, 672-73 (4th Cir. 2015) (unpublished) (""Generally, dispute-
resolution provisions, such as forum-selection clauses, are enforceable beyond the expiration of the contract if they are 
otherwise applicable to the disputed issue and the parties have not agreed otherwise."" (citations omitted)). "
1693,3," Ordinarily, we would also consider whether the exercise of jurisdiction was reasonable. CGC Holding Co., 974 F.3d at 1209 
(""Even when a defendant has purposely established minimum contacts with a forum state, minimum requirements inherent in the 
concept of fair play and substantial justice may defeat the reasonableness of jurisdiction."" (internal quotation marks and citations 
omitted)). That entails weighing five factors: (1) ""the burden on the defendant,"" (2) ""the forum state's interest in resolving the 
dispute,"" (3) ""the plaintiff's interest in receiving convenient and effective relief,"" (4) ""the interstate judicial system's interest in 
obtaining the most efficient resolution of controversies,"" and (5) ""the shared interest of the several states in furthering 
fundamental substantive social policies."" Id. at 1210 (citation omitted). But to defeat jurisdiction on this ground, ""[a] defendant 
must present a 'compelling' case that these factors render jurisdiction unreasonable."" Id. (quoting Grupo Cementos, 970 F.3d at 
1289). Defendants ignore these reasonableness factors entirely, so we needn't consider them. "
1694,4," The Court has in passing reaffirmed the Lanham Act's extraterritorial reach in two more recent decisions. See Morrison, 561 
U.S. at 271 n.11 (citing Steele and noting that the Court has interpreted the Lanham Act ""to have extraterritorial effect""); EEOC 
v. Arabian Am. Oil Co., 499 U.S. 244, 252, 111 S. Ct. 1227, 113 L. Ed. 2d 274 (1991) (""While recognizing that 'the legislation of 
Congress will not extend beyond the boundaries of the United States unless a contrary legislative intent appears,' the Court 
concluded that in light of the fact that the allegedly unlawful conduct had some effects within the United States, coupled with the 
[Lanham] Act's 'broad jurisdictional grant' and its 'sweeping reach into ""all commerce which may lawfully be regulated by 
Congress,""' the statute was properly interpreted as applying abroad."" (quoting Steele, 344 U.S. at 285, 287)). "
1696,5," Timberlane's third prong ""considers international comity,"" Trader Joe's Co., 835 F.3d at 972 (citation omitted), and further 
breaks down into seven additional factors: [1] the degree of conflict with foreign law or policy, [2] the nationality or allegiance of the parties [**30]  and the locations or 
principal places of business of corporations, [3] the extent to which enforcement by either state can be expected to achieve 
compliance, [4] the relative significance of effects on the United States as compared with those elsewhere, [5] the extent to 
which there is explicit purpose to harm or affect American commerce, [6] the foreseeability of such effect, and [7] the 
relative importance to the violations charged of conduct within the United States as compared with conduct abroad. Id. at 972-73 (brackets in original) (quoting Star-Kist Foods, 769 F.2d at 1395)."
1696,6," ""The Court has written in [the antitrust context], on the issue of extraterritorial application, far more recently than it has written 
on the Lanham Act, and thus the decisions reflect more recent evolutions in terms of legal analysis of extraterritorial activity."" 
McBee, 417 F.3d at 119. "
1700,7," Montreal Trading isn't to the contrary. 661 F.2d at 870. There, we noted that the trial court let the jury decide the subject-matter 
jurisdiction question about whether the Sherman Act applied extraterritorially to reach the defendants' conduct. See id. at 866, 
870. But we didn't pass on the question whether the trial court should have decided that issue as a matter of law. Id. at 870. "
1701,8," Defendants assert that only Abitron Germany sold products directly into the United States and that those sales totaled $16,670. 
But as Hetronic flags, that assertion contradicts Defendants' admissions both in their statement of undisputed facts in their 
motion for summary judgment and in an offer of proof they submitted at trial. Defendants represented in their statement of 
undisputed facts that their remote-control sales into the U.S. totaled €202,134.12 and ""were comprised of €185,463.52 of sales "
1702,," by Hetronic Germany, and €16,670.60 of sales by Abitron Germany."" Appellants' App. vol. 4 at 939. They made an identical 
representation in an offer of proof at trial. Given Defendants' failure in their reply brief to explain the disparity, we accept its 
admissions in the district court as the true totals of their direct U.S. sales. "
1703,9," In their reply brief, Defendants also challenge Hetronic's diversion-of-sales theory on two other grounds—that applying the 
theory ""exceeds the authority of the Commerce Clause"" and that Hetronic failed to prove its lost sales. Reply Br. at 13-21. HN27[ ] But we generally deem arguments raised for the first time in a reply brief waived. United States v. Leffler, 942 F.3d 1192,"
1703,1197," (10th Cir. 2019). Defendants offer no reason why we should depart from our usual rule, so we decline to consider these 
additional arguments. Id. (""[T]o allow an appellant to raise an argument for the first time in a reply brief would be manifestly 
unfair to the appellee who, under our rules, has no opportunity for a written response."" (internal quotation marks and citations 
omitted)). "
1707,10," For reasons unimportant here, Hetronic initially moved under Rule 50(a), but the district court rightly construed the motion as 
one for summary judgment."
1707,11," This due-process standard is met if ""there has been opportunity for a full and fair trial abroad before a court of competent 
jurisdiction, conducting the trial upon regular proceedings, after due citation or voluntary appearance of the defendant, and under 
a system of jurisprudence likely to secure an impartial administration of justice between the citizens of its own country and those 
of other countries, and there is nothing to show either prejudice in the court, or in the system of laws under which it is sitting, or 
fraud in procuring the judgment."" Phillips USA, 77 F.3d at 359 (quoting Hilton, 159 U.S. at 202); see also Soc'y of Lloyd's, 402 
F.3d at 999 (quoting same Hilton language)."
1707,12," At least one authority suggests that U.S. courts should apply foreign preclusion law if the foreign rules ""are substantially the 
same as the rules of the [U.S.] court."" Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws § 98 cmt. f (1971). Under that principle, it's 
arguable that EU preclusion law should govern this dispute. But the parties agree that federal issue-preclusion law applies, and 
they didn't provide any discussion of EU preclusion law. Given the lack of briefing on EU preclusion law, we follow the parties' 
lead and the authority we identify above in considering this issue under federal issue-preclusion law. "
1708,13," Several months after oral argument, Hetronic filed a Rule 28(j) letter informing us that the General Court of the European 
Union had upheld the Board of Appeal's decision. In response, Defendants renewed their assertion that the General Court, like 
EUIPO, lacked jurisdiction to decide the ownership issue. But as we explain below, Defendants waived any argument about 
EUIPO lacking jurisdiction by not raising it in the district court. "
1709,14," Defendants raise a number of other arguments in passing—usually devoting little more than a sentence to each—that we 
decline to address. First, they argue that EUIPO lacked jurisdiction to decide the ownership issue. Defendants have forfeited that 
argument by failing to raise it in the district court. And because Defendants failed to identify plain error as the standard of review 
governing this new argument (let alone contend that the argument survives that exacting standard), we decline to consider it. 
See Grupo Cementos, 970 F.3d at 1282-83 (""[I]n order to avoid a waiver on appeal, a party is required to identify plain error as 
the standard of review in their opening brief and to provide a defense of that standard's application."" (citations omitted)). Second, 
addressing the third element, Defendants argue that issue preclusion could bind only Abitron Germany, as the other Defendants 
weren't parties to the EUIPO proceedings. But like their jurisdictional argument, they didn't argue the third element in the district 
court, nor do they make the case that their argument can survive plain-error review, so we consider that argument waived. Id. "
1712,15," We also grant Defendants' unopposed motion to file five documents under seal. Each of the documents was marked as 
confidential under the district court's protective order, and we are satisfied that the parties have demonstrated ""a real and 
substantial interest that justifies depriving the public of access to the records."" JetAway Aviation, LLC v. Bd. of Cnty. Comm'rs, 
754 F.3d 824, 826 (10th Cir. 2014) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). "
1743,1," After this motion was fully briefed, Ms. O'Connell moved for leave to withdraw as counsel for Maxwell, which the Court granted. 
(ECF No. 32.) "
1744,2," Maxwell Foods, LLC, the plaintiff here, is the successor-in-interest to Maxwell Foods, Inc., the party to the PSA. (See Am. 
Compl. ¶¶ 1, 2, 16; PSA, Preamble.) "
1747,3," Although both parties appear to agree that the PSA is governed by the Uniform Commercial Code, neither discussed it in any 
depth. The Code is arguably more tolerant of vagueness than the common law. See, e.g., N.C.G.S. § 25-2-204(3) (""Even though 
one or more terms are left open a contract for sale does not fail for indefiniteness if the parties have intended to make a contract 
and there is a reasonably certain basis for giving an appropriate remedy.""); id. § 25-2-202(a) (stating that contract terms ""may be 
explained or supplemented by course of performance, course of dealing, or usage of trade""); Carolina Builders Corp. v. Howard-
Veasey Homes, Inc., 72 N.C. App. 224, 228, 324 S.E.2d 626 (1985)."
1747,4," See also, e.g., DeLoach v. Lorillard Tobacco Co., 391 F.3d 551, 555 (4th Cir. 2004) (construing clause in settlement agreement 
that provided that defendants' obligations ""would be 'no less favorable' to them 'than those terms agreed to'"" in any later 
settlement plaintiffs might reach with another co-defendant); Albertini v. Warner Music Grp. Corp., 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
103878, at *2, *7 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 23, 2008) (concluding that most-favored-nation clause was ""neither ambiguous nor reasonably 
subject to more than one interpretation"" when it provided that employee would ""be treated no less favorably than"" another), aff'd, 
351 Fed. Appx. 547 (2d Cir. 2009); Eveleth Taconite Co. v. Minn. Power & Light Co., 301 Minn. 20, 27, 221 N.W.2d 157 (1974) 
(""In our judgment, there is little doubt that the parties intended that the most-favored-nations clause would protect plaintiff from 
being placed in a noncompetitive position by provisions in its contracts with defendant . . . which were less advantageous than 
provisions its competitors might be granted by defendant at a later time during the agreed-upon span of plaintiff's contracts.""); 
Hyatt v. Al Jazeera Am. Holdings II, LLC, 2016 Del. Ch. LEXIS 57, at *29 n.54 (Del. Ch. Mar. 31, 2016) (""Generally speaking, 
'MFN provisions' are undertakings that the contracting party will be treated at least as well as other [parties] similarly situated.""). "
1748,5," To Smithfield's dismay, Maxwell goes on to say that the contemplated economic benefits also include ""any other economic 
benefits."" (Am. Compl. ¶ 33.) This sort of circularity won't do at trial, but a little lenity is allowed in the pleadings. "
1750,6," Monopoly claims usually involve allegations that a seller acquired market power so as to restrict output and raise prices. ""[A] 
monopsony is to the buy side of the market what a monopoly is to the sell side and is sometimes colloquially called a 'buyer's 
monopoly.'"" Weyerhaeuser Co. v. Ross-Simmons Hardwood Lumber Co., 549 U.S. 312, 320, 127 S. Ct. 1069, 166 L. Ed. 2d 911 
(2007) (citation and quotation marks omitted); see also Sykes, 372 N.C. at 330 n.2 (describing a monopsony as ""a market 
situation in which one buyer controls the market"" (citation and quotation marks omitted)). "
1751,7," See also, e.g., Moose v. Allegacy Fed. Credit Union, 2021 NCBC LEXIS 47, at *11-13 (N.C. Super. Ct. May 5, 2021) (involving 
a consumer adhesion contract); Hamm v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of N.C., 2010 NCBC LEXIS 17, at *31 (N.C. Super. Ct. Aug. 
27, 2010) (""Conduct by an insurance company that manifests an inequitable assertion of power or position also constitutes an 
unfair trade practice."" (citation and quotation marks omitted)); Gray v. North Carolina Ins. Underwriting Ass'n, 352 N.C. 61, 68-
73, 529 S.E.2d 676 (2000) (involving insurance carrier conduct). "
1762,1," In arguing to the contrary, Plaintiff relies on Lippitt v. Raymond James Fin. Servs., Inc.. 340 F.3d 1033 (9th Cir. 2002). 
However, Lippitt is distinguishable because the Ninth Circuit concluded that ""a state court need not inquire into [federal] 
regulations, or even refer to federal law"" to adjudicate the securities claim at issue in that case. Id. at 1045. For the reasons 
explained above, the instant cases requires application of federal antitrust laws. See California ex rel. Lockyer v. Dynegy, Inc., 
375 F.3d 831, 841 n.7 (9th Cir. 2004) (distinguishing Lippitt in case where ""the reference to and necessity of relying upon federal 
law is unavoidable""). "
1768,1," Following the D.C. Circuit's ruling in Bais Yaakov, the FCC eventually repealed the Opt-Out Regulation. See In re Rules & 
Regulations Implementing the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 Junk Fax Prevention Act of 2005 Petitions for 
Reconsideration &/or Declaratory Ruling & Retroactive Waiver of 47 C.F.R. § 64.1200(a)(4)(iv) Regarding the Commission's 
Opt-Out Notice Requirement for Faxes Sent with the Recipient's Prior Express Permission, 35 FCC Rcd. 3079 (2020). "
1774,2," We need not reach the question of whether Class A as defined initially by Bais Yaakov would nevertheless be rejected as a fail-
safe class were there otherwise no predominance problem. "
1775,3," The letter stated, ""In all events, ACT hereby commits to paying $45,600 to Bais Yaakov, by way of the payment tendered with 
this letter or through other means as necessary at the conclusion of this litigation."" It also stated that ""this tendered payment is 
unconditional and irrevocable."" "
1776,4," Compare Chen v. Allstate Ins. Co., 819 F.3d 1136, 1144-46 (9th Cir. 2016) (reasoning that the defendant's deposit of the full 
amount of plaintiff's claims in an escrow account did not moot the plaintiff's claim since the plaintiff had not ""actually or 
constructively received"" the money), with Leyse v. Lifetime Ent. Servs., LLC, 679 F. App'x 44, 48 & n.2 (2d Cir. 2017) (summary 
order) (concluding that the district court properly entered judgment on the plaintiff's individual claim where the defendant 
deposited the full amount recoverable by the plaintiff with the clerk of court). "
1780,5," ACT's records indicate that it sent more than 28,355 fax advertisements between June 30, 2008, and June 30, 2012. Bais 
Yaakov of Spring Valley v. ACT, Inc., 328 F.R.D. 6, 9 (D. Mass. 2018). "
1781,6," It is worth noting that the inquiry that I contemplate a district court undertaking here is not particularly novel, even in the class 
action context. As to any request to certify a class, the district court must assess whether the class definition is sufficiently 
""definite"" so as to ""allow the class members to be ascertainable."" Nexium, 777 F.3d at 19. In Nexium, we concluded that the 
proposed class ""satisfie[d] th[at] standard[] by being defined in terms of purchasers of Nexium during the class period,"" id., even 
though the determination of whether any particular individual falls within that class is an inherently individualized one that the 
defendants there in theory could have contested. Yet, we expressed no concern -- and no one argued -- that this feature of the 
inquiry on its own automatically destroyed the efficiencies that make class actions a valuable procedural device. "
1793,1," The facts set forth herein are drawn from ERIS's First Amended Counterclaims (the ""Counterclaims"") (ECF 40) and materials 
incorporated by reference in the Counterclaims, including the ASTM E1527 standard and EDR's sample ""Certified Sanborn Map 
Report."" Decl. of Joshua S. Wolkoff (""Wolkoff Decl."") (ECF 46), Ex. A, C. See, e.g., Halebian v. Berv, 644 F.3d 122, 131 n.7 (2d 
Cir. 2011) (""[I]t is well established that on a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), the court may 
also rely upon documents attached to the complaint as exhibits and documents incorporated by reference in the complaint."") 
(internal citations omitted). Citations to ""¶"" or ""¶¶"" are to the corresponding paragraph numbers in the Counterclaims. "
1794,2," For simplicity, ""Sanborn"" is used to refer to The Sanborn Library LLC and its alleged predecessors, including The Sanborn Map 
Company. ERIS alleges, on information and belief, that EDR is a ""sister company"" to Sanborn ""with a common parent or with a 
group of common members,"" but states that ""[f]urther discovery"" is needed to ascertain the ""exact nature"" of EDR's relationship 
with Sanborn. ¶ 16; see ¶ 88 (suggesting EDR may own or have owned Sanborn ""in whole or in part""). It is also worth noting that 
ERIS refers to counterclaim-defendants collectively as ""EDR-Sanborn"" throughout the Counterclaims, though all parties refer to 
the entities collectively as only ""EDR"" in their motion to dismiss briefs. As specified above, I refer to the entities collectively as 
""EDR-Sanborn."""
1794,3," ERIS alleges, on information and belief, that ""every commercial property sold in this country for $1 million in value or more first 
undergoes a Phase I ESA before it is purchased"" to protect against liability under CERCLA. ¶ 25."
1794,4," While ERIS alleges that there are more than 1.3 million Sanborn Maps, EDR-Sanborn inconsistently suggests that the number 
of Sanborn Maps ranges from 1.2 to 1.4 million in its pleadings and the documents incorporated by reference into the 
Counterclaims.

ERIS's defenses, and thus not amenable to a stay""). Accordingly, fact discovery, including discovery related to the

1801,14," Defendants assert that instead of isolating each category of anticompetitive conduct, the District Court should sustain its 
Sherman Act claims because they are supported by a combined ""monopoly broth"" of anticompetitive conduct. (ECF 40 at 3). 
The ""monopoly broth"" concept recognizes that, in analyzing antitrust claims alleging a multitude of anticompetitive conduct, 
courts should ""avoid 'tightly compartmentalizing the various factual components' of [each claim] and 'wiping the slate clean after 
scrutiny of each.'"" Valassis Commc'ns, Inc. v. News Corp., No. 17-CV-7378 (PKC), 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27770, 2019 WL

been employed as a replacement for an individual review of alleged anticompetitive conduct. See Groton, 662 F.2d at 928 (""[W]e

802093 at *6 (dismissing plaintiff's antitrust claims insofar as they alleged predatory bidding and explaining that ""not all actions of 
an alleged violator may be properly considered by a jury as ingredients in a 'monopoly broth'""). Moreover, both cases recognize 
that ""it is unlikely that multiple independently lawful acts can come together to create"" a monopoly broth, as ""it is not the case 
that 'if there is a fraction of validity to each of [a litigant's] claims and the sum of the fractions is one or more, the plaintiffs have

1808,27," ERIS's reliance on LePage's Inc. v. 3M, 324 F.3d 141 (3d Cir.2003) to support its bundling allegations is inapposite. Id.at 177 
(Greenberg, J., dissenting) (emphasizing that plaintiff had ""not satisfied the stricter tests devised by other courts considering 
bundled rebates,"" including the Ortho standard). The LePage's standard for bundled discounts has not been adopted by other 
circuits and has been interpreted narrowly by the Third Circuit. See ZF Meritor, LLC v. Eaton Corp., 696 F.3d 254, 274 n.11 (3d 
Cir. 2012) (interpreting  [*45] LePage's narrowly in light of intervening Supreme Court precedent); Cascade Health Sols. v.

LePage's and cost-based approaches, such as Ortho's, and emphasizing that the bipartisan Antitrust Modernization 
Commission, created by Congress in 2002, ""noted [that] the fundamental problem with the LePage's standard is that it does not 
consider whether the bundled discounts constitute competition on the merits, but simply concludes that all bundled discounts 
offered by a monopolist are anticompetitive with respect to its competitors who do not manufacture an equally diverse product 
line"" and thus ""could protect a less efficient competitor at the expense of consumer welfare"")."
1808,28," To the extent ERIS also seeks to pursue a Section 2 exclusive dealing claim (¶ 158), it should likewise be sustained. As an 
initial matter, because EDR-Sanborn did not address such a claim in its opening brief and only mentioned it in one footnote in its 
reply brief, EDR-Sanborn arguably waived any argument in favor of dismissal. See supra note 10. Regardless, exclusive dealing 
claims are subjected to the same substantial foreclosure analysis under both sections (as EDR acknowledges), and, thus, 
ERIS's allegations survive dismissal for the reasons set out below. Maxon Hyundai Mazda v. Carfax, Inc., No. 13-CV-2680 
(AJN), 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 139480, 2014 WL 4988268, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 29, 2014) (finding, after sustaining plaintiff's 
Section 1 Claim, that ""the analysis [regarding whether defendant participated in anticompetitive conduct for purposes of Section 
2] is essentially the same as it was for Section 1 above. The requisite anticompetitive action alleged in the Complaint is the 
formation of exclusive dealing contracts that foreclose a significant share of the market.""); ECF 51 at 8 n.16. "
1809,29, EDR-Sanborn has waived any argument based on this factor. See supra note 10. 
1810,30," I reject EDR's argument that its exclusivity agreements cannot be anticompetitive because ERIS attempted to bid against at 
least one of EDR's exclusive contracts and lost. ¶ 121. The cases cited by EDR are inapposite: In Balaklaw v. Lovell, the Circuit 
affirmed summary judgment in favor of defendants and found no evidence of market foreclosure where an exclusivity agreement 
was freely terminable on six-months' notice and was entered into after an open, competitive bidding process. 14 F.3d 793, 796, 
799, 801 (2d Cir. 1994). Relying on Lovell, Judge Sweet found, on a motion to dismiss, that exclusive contracts were not 
anticompetitive where, as alleged, they were not fully exclusive and were of limited duration (no more than three years), and 
defendant entertained bids at the conclusion of each agreement's term. Spinelli v. Nat'l Football League, 96 F. Supp. 3d 81, 117-
18 (S.D.N.Y. 2015). Still, the Spinelli court acknowledged that a plaintiff can plausibly allege exclusivity agreements to be 
anticompetitive by ""alleg[ing] facts showing exceptional circumstances, such as evidence of predatory practices or a unique 
opportunity to leverage two distinct monopolies."" Id. at 118 (internal citations omitted). Here, the exclusivity agreements are not 
alleged to be of short duration or (invariably) subject to an open, competitive bidding process, and ERIS plausibly alleges that 
EDR is engaging in predatory practices harming competition in the ERAD market."
1810,31," The Blog Post does not directly define ""Sanborn Maps"" but instead seems to use the term to refer to all maps published by 
Sanborn. See Ezovski, supra note 4 (""As many people familiar with Environmental Data Resources know, EDR purchased the 
complete Sanborn Library in 1996 . . . . By doing this, EDR secured the largest, most complete collection of 1.4 million Sanborn 
Maps in the country (which it still is today). However, since then, many people in our industry have been trying to 'skirt around' 
the copyright issue of Sanborns.""). The Blog Post nowhere suggests that any Sanborn Maps lack copyright protection. "
1811,32," The Litigation Statements do not directly define the ""Sanborn Map® collection"" but seem to use the term to refer to all maps 
published by Sanborn and acquired by EDR. See ¶¶ 94-100 (""We acquired the Sanborn Map collection in 1996. The maps were 
carefully crafted by cartographers . . . This craftsmanship is reflected in each Sanborn Map, and we are proud to serve as the 
owner and custodian of this important historical resource.""). Sanborn uses the term similarly in the Copyright Suit complaint 
(which is linked in the Litigation Statements). See ECF 12 ¶ 16 (""EDR's offerings include . . . the complete catalog of fire 
insurance maps originally published by Sanborn Library's predecessor in-interest, the Sanborn Map Company (the 'Sanborn 
Maps').""); ¶ 19 (""Today, digital copies of the Sanborn Maps can be purchased for commercial use exclusively through EDR, on 
an a-la-carte basis, through a variety of customizable report packages. In all, there are roughly 1.2 million Sanborn Maps in 
Sanborn Library's collection.""); see also ¶ 5 (""ERIS has amassed a collection of nearly one million fire insurance maps which, 
upon information and belief, is built entirely of Sanborn Library's copyrighted maps.""); Prayer for Relief A (asking for ""[a] 
declaration that [ERIS] ha[s] directly and/or indirectly infringed [Sanborn's] copyrights in each of the Sanborn Maps). "
1812,33," At the motion to dismiss stage, courts typically evaluate each challenged statement (or set of statements) and determine 
whether it is actionable. ""If the Court finds that some of the statements are actionable but others are not, then the Court may 
dismiss the claims based on the nonactionable statements and allow the claims based on the actionable statements to go 
forward . . . [D]iscovery w[ill] then proceed for any statements held to be actionable, but not for any statements that fail to 
support a claim."" Biro v. Conde Nast, 883 F. Supp. 2d 441, 457 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) (granting motion to dismiss claims with respect 
to some statements and denying motion with respect to others); see Watson v. NY Doe 1, 439 F. Supp. 3d 152, 160-62

(S.D.N.Y. Oct. 15, 2004) (same). "
1814,34," Any argument for defamation liability based on the Blog Post may also be deemed waived or abandoned due to ERIS's failure 
to sufficiently address it in its opposition brief. See supra note 10; ECF 47 at 26."
1814,35, I have already found Oral Statement 1 to constitute unactionable opinion. See supra Section III.D.1.
1814,36," Under New York procedural law, a plaintiff must plead defamatory statements with greater particularity. N.Y. C.P.L.R. 3016(a) 
(""In an action for libel or slander, the particular words complained of shall be set forth in the complaint . . . .""). While federal 
courts instead subject defamation claims to the more ""liberal pleading standards of Fed R. Civ. P. 8,"" courts in this Circuit have 
repeatedly emphasized that ""[e]ven under the more lenient federal standard, however, the [litigant] must at least 'identify the "
1815,," allegedly defamatory statements, the person who made the statements, the time when the statements were made, and the third 
parties to whom the statements were published.'"" Neal v. Asta Funding, Inc., 13-CV-2176 (VB), 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 113142,

1815,37," ERIS has now had the opportunity to take discovery on these statements, which are also relevant to ERIS's affirmative 
defense of copyright misuse that EDR-Sanborn has not moved to strike. "
1816,38," EDR-Sanborn also argues that ERIS's defamation, as well as all other claims made in Counts VI-XII, should be dismissed 
pursuant to the Noerr-Pennington doctrine insofar as they are based on the Litigation Statements. (ECF 45 at 31 & n. 24). 
However, for the reasons stated in Section III.B.2.a, any dismissal based on Noerr-Pennington immunity should not be granted 
at this point in the litigation. "
1817,39," See, e.g., Soter, 523 F. Supp. 3d 389, 2021 WL 744511, at *13 (finding insufficient plaintiff's conclusory allegation that ""[a]s a 
natural and immediate consequence of [the] disparaging statements [alleged], [plaintiff] suffered monetary losses in the amount 
of at least $1990,"" because plaintiff provided ""no further explanation,"" did not identify the lost customer other than as a ""school 
on the west coast,"" and did not present facts showing that a sale was imminent or foreseeable); Enigma Software Grp., 194 F.
