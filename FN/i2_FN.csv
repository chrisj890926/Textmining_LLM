22,1," Count IV of the complaint for trademark dilution under the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. §1125(c) was dismissed by the Court in 
Rockwell Automation, Inc. v. Radwell Int'l, Inc., No. 15-cv--5246 (RBK/JS), 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 165633, 2016 WL 7018531

26,4," A PLC is a solid-state, electronic device that operates a machine within a factory assembly line or other industrial setting 
through software logic programmed into its memory and includes a Central Processing Unit (""CPU""), memory caches, and 
circuits to receive input and output data. It operates machinery by continually scanning the software to determine if and when 
pre-programmed input conditions of the machine are met. Once input status indicates a start event should occur, the PLC 
executes the operation software of the machine to perform a function, and then updates output status of that performance."

27,7," Section 332 with Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 authorizes the ITC to perform investigations into the unlawful importation, 
sale, or sale for importation into the United States of articles that infringe a valid, enforceable U.S. registered trademark. 19 
U.S.C. §1332 and §1337(a)(1)(C). §337 investigations aim to prevent, investigate and redress unfair practices in import trade (19 U.S.C. §1337) and provide a 
venue other than federal courts for trademark owners seeking to redress trademark infringement and unfair competition. Not an 
Article III court but a quasi-adjudicative administrative agency, the ITC follows its own procedural rules, codified in the Federal 
Regulations [""CFR"" or ""Regulations""] largely at 19 C.F.R.§201.16 and part 210. The ITC has the authority to grant the following remedies: exclusion orders of importing and selling (against parties); temporary 
limited exclusion orders (during the investigation); cease and desist orders; and temporary cease and desist orders (19 U.S.C. 
1337(d) - (g)), but cannot authorize damages, which can be granted in concurrent federal court filings Joseph H. Heckendorn et

29,10," The Court notes that Rockwell is careful not to allege any of its ADs could have intentionally sold Rockwell PLCs to Radwell or 
a Radwell agent, which would point to a breach of Rockwell's ""closed"" distribution system from within and ultimately to a need to 
sue one of its own ADs for breach of contract. "

directly pertains to Radwell's agreement with the ITC, and not to any later proceedings where Radwell was no longer a party. 
Available as a matter of public record, this information the Court can take public notice of. Actually, the 1074 ITC Investigation consent order could not be clearer: ...""Radwell agrees not to sell for importation, import into the United States, or sell in the United States [*34]  after

exportation) any remaining inventory of imported Accused Products in the United States. "
35,17," System Integrators, OEMs, panel shops, etc."
35,18," To reiterate, these are sales of products that Radwell may have acquired in the U.S. but which are unauthorized and do not 
bear the same features as authorized products sold in the U.S. These sales may also be called here ""nonconforming""."
35,19, See supra note 8. 
36,20," An example of this Court's rounding out the Third Circuit's pronouncements with jurisprudence form other Circuits can be 
found in the opinion on defendant's previous summary judgment motion. See Rockwell Automation, Inc. v. Radwell International, 
Inc., 15-cv-05246, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 222361, 2019 WL 7288946 (D.N.J. 30 Dec 2019) [this Court relying on a Second 
Circuit case to show that Lexmark and Kirtsaeng had no effect on the vigor of material differences jurisprudence]. "
37,21," There, the mark holder Deere had brought a §337 claim against its own European distributors for selling in the U.S. those 
Deere harvesters destined for the European market, and which materially differed from the harvesters authorized for sale in the 
U.S. Id.at 1320. In finding the European harvesters had infringed for lacking the material differences of the U.S. goods, the ITC 
issued an exclusion order. On a first appeal, the Federal Circuit vacated and remanded the matter back to the ITC to require Deere to meet its burden of 
demonstrating either it had not condoned the importation of the European harvesters and / or the number of European-imported 
harvesters was small and not substantially all of its U.S. harvester sales. But, the Federal Circuit still did not expressly define 
what percentage of total U.S. sales constituted ""not substantially all"". Id. at 1325. On the first remand, the ALJ found infringement because Deere had not authorized the importation of the European harvesters 
even though the number of European harvesters sold in the U.S. was so small as to have negligible effect on the goodwill of 
Deere's marks. See Deere v. ITC, 605 F.3d 1350 (Fed. Cir. 2010). The full ITC reversed the ALJ, finding Deere had indeed 
authorized the European harvester sales. The matter was again appealed. Id. at 1353. On the second appeal, the Federal Circuit affirmed that Deere had so authorized the European harvester sales in the U.S but 
remanded for a second time to the ITC only for its proper calculation of the mark holder's non-conforming U.S. sales relative to 
the total U.S. sales, which devolved to this ratio: Number of Deere European harvesters sold in the U.S. Total number of Deere harvesters sold in the U.S. Id. at 1358 - 1360. Deere had argued evidence to the ALJ that showed this ratio to be 141 / 1451, which meant the European 
harvesters sold in the U.S. constituted but 3.1% of all U.S.-sold harvesters. Deere had further argued to the ALJ that this 
percentage was insufficient to defeat its trademark claims against Bourdeau, relying on Warner-Lambert Co. v. Northside Dev. 
Corp., 86 F.3d 3 (2d Cir.1996). There, the Second Circuit had found authorization of 4.4% of non-conforming sales to be small 
enough to allow the mark holder relief. Also, in its second appeal, the Federal Circuit agreed with Deere's argument. On the second remand, as required, the ITC used the above ratio to determine whether that small percentage of non-conforming 
sales relieved infringement liability (Id. at 1359-1361) and in particular whether ""96.6 to 96.9% [of sales that are conforming] is 
'substantially all.'"" Id. at 1362. Specifically, the ITC found that since the 96.6% of all U.S. sales were conforming, Deere's 
trademark infringement claims were viable. There was a third appeal to the Federal Circuit, this time by Bourdeau, but that court affirmed the ITC's finding. "
38,22," However, there is still a lack of clarity as to how much more than 4.4% and less than 10% of the mark holder's nonconforming 
sales in the U.S. preserves trademark infringement liability. "
39,23," However, Rockwell notes: Radwell admits quality control of the PLCs is important to customers and does not dispute its 
nonconforming products do not bear Rockwell's post-manufacturing quality control. ECF Doc. 530-3 (Declaration of Paul Tanck), 
Exhibit 33 (Deposition of Jason Larsen, a Radwell employee with authority to represent Radwell before the ITC and self-
reporting as Radwell's previous quality assurance manager, 28 Feb 2018) 93:19-94:2; 115:14-116:1; 118:4-119:4; 121:11-
122:17; 279:1-9; 309:7-310:20 (addressing quality control); 424:9-425:17."
39,24," In so doing, the Court makes no finding here about whether absence of the other two material differences harm or not the 
goodwill of the asserted marks, which plaintiff may seek to adjudicate. "
40,25," Radwell has requested to exclude evidence from the ITC 1074 investigation AFTER its consent order, dated 12 July 2018. 
Radwell argues that evidence collected in this ITC investigation cannot pertain possibly or logically to Radwell. Taking into 
account that Radwell could neither have rebutted nor been afforded due process for such evidence taken after this date, the 
Court does not consider testimony in the ITC 1074 investigation dated AFTER Radwell's consent order. However, Rockwell 
testimony before that date would have been afforded Radwell's cross-examination, review, and due process to rebut and correct. 
Therefore, Ms. Bentley's testimony, taken before Radwell's consent order and laid open to Radwell's review and objection, must 
be considered admissible here."
40,26," When it learned that CCD, a Rockwell AD bound by its AD agreement, was selling unauthorized gray goods to Radwell, 
Rockwell sued CCD in Federal District Court for violating its agreement. ECF Doc. 530-3 (Declaration of Paul Tanck), Exhibit 9 
(Rodney Michael Direct Witness Statement in the ITC 1074 Investigation at Q97, dated 1 June 2018). Rodney Michael was 
testifying as Rockwell's Director of Global Market Access."
40,27," Moreover, testimony by Rodney Michael (see supra n. 21) during the ITC 1074 investigation belies Radwell's assertions of 
Rockwell's lack of diligence in following up suspicions that a particular VAR, LEC, was actually not adding value to customer-
requested installations/systems. ECF Doc. 529-1 (Declaration of Peter Shapiro), Exhibit 1: 73-89 (Deposition [individual] of 
Michael Rodney in the ITC 1074 Investigation, dated 1 February 2018 [before Radwell's consent order]) [testifying to how 
Rodney actually confirmed LEC was a front for re-selling Rockwell PLCs]. "

52,35," A horizontal market allocation can be broadly defined as an agreement among existing or potential direct competitors to 
divide or otherwise restrict territories, output, customers, or product or service markets among themselves. See, e.g., U.S. v. 
Topco Associates, Inc., 405 U.S. 596, 608, 92 S. Ct. 1126, 31 L. Ed. 2d 515 (1972) (""an agreement between competitors at 
the same level of the market structure to allocate territories in order to minimize competition""). (emphasis added). "
54,36," Continental T.V. is the leading Supreme Court decision on applying rule of reason to such restraints. At issue there was the 
legality under Sherman Act §1 of Sylvania's product distribution program adopted to stem the sharp decline in its share of the 
national television market to about only 1 to 2%. To attract more aggressive franchisees, Sylvania limited the number of 
franchises in any given territory and required each to sell only Sylvania products at only one franchise location in the territory. 
This strategy enabled Sylvania to increase its market share to approximately 5%. However, after the plaintiff's franchise tried, 
over Sylvania's objection, to open an unauthorized outlet in another franchisee's territory, Sylvania ended plaintiff's franchise. See also, Business Electronics Corp. v. Sharp Electronics Corp., 485 U.S. 717, 108 S. Ct. 1515, 99 L. Ed. 2d 808 (1988), where 
the Court decided a rule of reason, rather than per se analysis, governed an agreement between a manufacturer and one of its 
dealers to terminate another dealer known for price-cutting; and AT & T Corp. v. JMC Telecom, LLC, 470 F.3d 525, 531 (3d Cir.

76,5," Dr. Fleischer's qualifications render this case distinguishable from the Tenth Circuit case of TK-7 Corp. v. Estate of Barbouti, 
993 F.2d 722 (10th Cir. 1993) on which the DPPs rely. In that case, the court found that an expert opinion was inadmissible 
where the expert ""failed to demonstrate any basis for concluding that another individual's opinion on a subjective financial 
prediction was reliable, other than the fact that it was the opinion of someone he believed to be an expert who had a financial 
interest in making an accurate prediction."" Id. at 732. Unlike TK-& Corp., Dr. Fleischer is qualified and has indicated that he independently reached his opinion. He merely confirmed 
and corroborated that opinion with Dr. Patel and Mr. LoPiccolo. "
79,6," The DPPs contend that Dr. Fleischer admitted at deposition that because Ms. Kinard's company, PPD, was in charge of 
developing and launching the website and call center, Ms. Kinard was in a better position to testify as to how quickly the go-live 
requirements could have been completed. (Fleischer Jan. 7, 2020 Dep. 121:4-8.) However, an expert will not be excluded ""simply because [the court] does not deem the proposed expert to be the best qualified 
or because the proposed expert does not have the specialization that the court considers most appropriate."" Holbrook v. Lykes, 
Bros. S.S. Co., 80 F.3d 777, 782 (3d Cir. 1996). Rather, in the event that Dr. Fleischer and Ms. Kinard offer conflicting 
testimony on this subject at trial, it will be within the province of the jury to weigh their credibility, taking into consideration Dr. 
Fleischer's admission that Ms. Kinard is more qualified. "
84,7," The States also argue that Dr. Curtis is also not qualified to draw conclusions about patients' or physicians' preferences from a 
medical perspective because she is not an expert in opioid use disorder and has no medical training. Defendant, however, does 
not offer Dr. Curtis as a medical expert, but rather as a statistical and consumer/marketing research expert. As such, I need not 
address this argument. "
85,8," (See States' Mot., Ex. B, Expert Rebuttal Report of Ernst Berndt (""Berndt Rebuttal Rep."") ¶¶ 76 79 (""For example, the 2011 
Suboxone Film Post Launch Monitor excludes potential respondents that never took Film, so their preferences for taking and 
remaining on tablets are also excluded from the analysis. . . . This introduces sampling bias in the results, because the 
outcomes are based upon a non-representative sample of the population that would, on average, already exhibit a preference 
for Film.""); States' Mot., Ex. J, Expert Report of Nicholas Jewell (""Jewell Rep.""), ¶ 63 (""It is clear that physicians' opinions and 
practices were the driver in providing film experience for a significant number of respondents, a factor that has an indeterminate 
influence on patients' responses. However, it is reasonable to assume that this phenomenon will bias preference results in favor 
of film as the imposition of film by a physician brings with it the implicit (if not explicit) endorsement of the physician, potentially 
affecting a patient's preference for one formulation over the other."").) "
86,9," Specifically, Piano commented: ""We want to stress that the ratio of HTH [Here to Help] enrolled physicians to non-HTH enrolled 
physicians was 10 to 3 in this research: this inequality increased branded over generic preference in this sample compared to 
what would likely occur in the market. In forecasting preference shares this inequality overstates the share preferences for 
branded!"" (States' Mot., Ex. 24.) "

RADARS I looked at the ""Root causes, clinical effects, and outcomes of unintentional exposures to buprenorphine by young 
children."" (Id.) RADARS II looked at ""Abuse and diversion of buprenorphine sublingual tablets and film."" (Id. at n.2.) "
92,11," I do not find Defendant's cited cases persuasive as each case involved either (a) an expert who admitted that he/she did not 
prepare certain portions of the report or (b) there was clear and convincing evidence that the expert did not prepare the report. I 
have neither scenario before me. See, e.g., Numatics v. Balluff, 66 F. Supp. 3d 934, 941 (E.D. Mich. 2014) (excluding expert 
report where expert conceded at deposition that defendant's counsel wrote the expert report and the expert reviewed the draft of 
the 64-page report for only a couple of hours before signing it); DataQuill Ltd. v. Handspring, Inc., No. 01-4635, 2003 U.S. Dist. "
93,," LEXIS 2981, 2003 WL 737785, at *4 (N.D. Ill. Feb. 28, 2003) (excluding expert testimony where expert admitted that plaintiff's 
counsel actually typed his report, large quantities of plaintiff's interrogatory responses appeared verbatim in the expert report, 
and expert did not even follow a proper infringement analysis); Play Visions, Inc v. Dollar Tree Stores, Inc., No. 09-1769, 2011 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 61336, 2011 WL 2292326, at *9 (W.D. Wash. June 8, 2011) (excluding expert report where expert admitted at 
deposition that counsel had just asked questions of the expert and filled in the answers on the report and that the expert did not 
see the final report until after it was circulated to the defendants; expert then submitted a ""change"" sheet after reviewing his 
deposition testimony which had ""wholesale reversals of his testimony under oath"" without any explanation); Stein v. Foamex Int'l, 
Inc., No. 00-2356, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12211, 2001 WL 936566, at *5 (E.D. Pa. Aug. 15, 2001) (excluding expert affidavit 
where expert never claimed to have played any substantial role in its preparation, other than signing it, and party offered no 
evidence that expert prepared affidavit in any meaningful way). "
95,12," The DPPs argue that Dr. Westreich has reviewed internal Reckitt documents, including the survey of how 300 doctors reacted 
to Reckitt's promotional statements, and as such, he is qualified to render opinions about physicians in general. I disagree. Dr. 
Westreich is a physician, not a statistician who has conducted extensive surveys about which he can testify."
95,13," Defendant also argues that Dr. Westreich's report is undermined by his own deposition testimony where he states that when 
teaching medical students or young doctors how to evaluate claims that drug manufacturers make about their products, he tells 
them to rely on research that has a solid scientific basis as opposed to marketing materials from the drug companies unless 
there is substantiation. (Westreich Dep. 138:16-140:21.) Any such contradiction between Dr. Westreich's opinion as to 
prescribing practices in his experience and Dr. Westreich's deposition testimony regarding such practices is not the basis for 
exclusion of his report, but rather is properly raised on cross-examination."
95,14," (See, e.g., Westreich Rep. ¶ 103 (""Medical research that is solely funded by pharmaceutical companies often draws questions 
of reliability. Studies that are entirely paid for by pharmaceutical companies tend to have results that favor the industry.""); ¶ 109 
(discussing different types of bias that can occur in studies); ¶ 147 (""From the early planning stages, Reckitt had substantial 
involvement in creating the objectives, design, execution, and ultimate wording of the pediatric exposure analysis.""); ¶ 155 
(""documents extrinsic to the paper also show that it was finalized under extraordinary time pressures, which may also have 
contributed to data inaccuracies.""); ¶ 189 (""as with the Pediatric Exposure Analysis, Reckitt Benckiser had substantial input into 
the design of the Lavonas Abuse and Diversion study."").) "
99,15," Mr. Verscharen succinctly explained the difference between AB-rated substitution and therapeutic substitution. When a 
prescription has an AB-rated generic, the pharmacist has the authority, and in most states, the responsibility, to use a generic 
whenever available. If no AB-rated generic is available, then the pharmacist must fill the prescription as written. In some limited instances, however, a pharmacist may attempt to do a therapeutic substitution. This may occur when a 
pharmacist receives a prescription for a brand name drug that does not have an AB-rated generic associated with it, but there 
may be another drug available with a similar therapeutic result that might provide benefits (economic or clinical) to the patient, as 
well as economic benefits to the pharmacy. This other drug would have a different chemical, dosage strength or dosage form, 
and would be dispensed in place of the originally prescribed product. For therapeutic substitution to occur, however, the 
pharmacist must call the doctor and have the prescription changed. (Verscharen Rep. ¶¶ 48-50.) "
102,16," Defendant also challenges Zettler's third and fourth opinions above, but raises them in the context of its ""Motion to Exclude 
Plaintiffs' Expert Opinions Asserting or Relying Upon Assertions that Alleged Reckitt Safety Messages Were 'False,' 'Misleading,' 
'Disparaging,' 'Fabricated,' 'Fraudulent,' 'Sham,' or 'Deceptive.'"" I discuss these arguments infra. "
103,17," During her deposition, Professor Zettler expanded on her FDA experience. (Zettler Dep. 38:15-40:19.) With respect 
specifically to shared REMS programs, Professor Zettler noted that she ""provided legal advice on any issues that came up with 
those particular REMS . . . [and on] whatever legal issues might have come up for the agency"" and specifically identified two 
REMS that she worked on with elements of shared safe use and single shared systems. (Id. at 60:3-61:12.) To the extent 
Defendant argues that Professor Zettler did not work on a waiver request while at the FDA, the DPPs accurately note that the 
SSRS waiver in this case was the first ever granted and it occurred just months before she left the FDA in 2013. (Id. at 273:6-
274:11.) Nonetheless, based on her experience, she was able to discuss the waiver statute and its requirements. (Id. at 274:4-
278:20, 284:6-286:22.) "
112,18," Defendant cites to several cases for the proposition that the meaning of federal regulations is not a question of fact on which 
experts may opine, but rather a question of law to be resolved by the court. These cases are distinguishable. In Bammerline v. 
Navister International Transportation Corp., 30 F.3d 898 (7th Cir. 1994), for example, a driver brought an action against a truck 
manufacturer for injuries sustained in an accident, alleging that the manufacturer designed the seat belt assembly improperly. Id. 
at 900. Given that the ultimate issue in the case involved whether the seat belt assembly was defective, the court found that an "
113,," expert's testimony that the seat belt assembly did not comply with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards impermissibly 
usurped the role of the jury. Id. Similarly, Gordon v. New England Central Railroad, Inc., No. 17-154, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
146169, 2019 WL 4068639 (D. Vt. Aug. 28, 2019) involved a negligence claim against a railroad for failure to appropriately 
maintain track facilities. The court found that an expert report which was to ""determine the standard of care"" under federal 
regulations was an improper legal conclusion because ""standard of care"" is a legal decision within the province of the court. 
2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 146169, [WL] at *3. It further found that expert's opinion that the violation of federal regulations caused 
the collapse of the embankment was an ultimate conclusion exclusively within the province of the jury. Id. "
115,19," Defendant asserts numerous challenges to this letter, arguing that (a) it does not state that the safety claims were false; (2) to 
the extent it can be read to state that film did not possess any safety benefits, ""the letter would be expressing an inadmissible 
opinion with no foundation""; and (3) the passages relied upon by Plaintiffs are inadmissible hearsay. These arguments are not 
appropriate for resolution in this Daubert motion. "
116,20," Defendants cite two cases for this proposition, neither of which are applicable here. See Meadows v. Anchor Longwall and 
Rebuild, 306 F. App'x 781, 790 (3d Cir. 2009) (excluding expert where testimony did not fit with the otherwise uncontroverted 
evidence before the court); Brugler v. Unum Grp., No. 15-1031, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 158503, 2019 WL 4452226, at *15 (M.D. 
Pa. Sept. 17, 2019) (excluding expert testimony where it was based on mere assumptions without any factual founding, thus 
rendering testimony unreliable). "

124,5," Bosch GmbH also alleges here that the Court does not have personal jurisdiction because of the alleged improper service of 
process. King v. Taylor, 694 F.3d 650, 655 (6th Cir. 2012) (""[W]ithout proper service of process, consent, waiver, or forfeiture, a 
court may not exercise personal jurisdiction over a named defendant.""); see also Plastic Molded Techs., Inc. v. Bayerische 
Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 144003, 2009 WL 10680593, at *3 (E.D. Mich. May 19, 2009) (Hood,

company and is one of Bosch GmbH's roughly 300 subsidiaries worldwide. [Id.] Bosch GmbH and its subsidiaries are called 
""The Bosch Group,"" and that group describes itself as ""a leading global supplier of technology and services."" [ECF No. 73-5,

127,7," The savings clause states: ""Nothing in this section shall restrict any right which any person (or class of persons) may have 
under any statute or common law to seek enforcement of any emission standard or limitation or to seek any other relief . . . ."" 42 
U.S.C. § 7604(e). "
128,8," The Supreme Court did not foreclose states from permitting indirect purchaser actions. See, e.g., A & M Supply Co. v. 
Microsoft Corp., 252 Mich. App. 580, 654 N.W.2d 572, 574 (Mich. App. 2002). Michigan's Legislature passed an Illinois Brick 
repealer law in 1984. See MCL 445.778(2); see also GEICO Corp. v. Autoliv, Inc., 345 F. Supp. 3d 799, 823 (E.D. Mich. 2018) 
(finding that several states have implemented ""so-called"" 'Illinois Brick repealer statutes'"" that ""allow recovery by indirect 
purchasers under state law""). Here, however, Bosch GmbH indicates—and Plaintiffs do not argue otherwise—that Plaintiffs have 
not brought any state law claims against the specific defendant, Bosch GmbH. [ECF No. 153, Pg.ID 7457 n. 3]; see also Miller v. 
Mercy Anderson Hosp., 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 115041, 2007 WL 9729000, at *2 (S.D. Ohio July 17, 2007) (""Plaintiff must state 
specifically . . . the defendant or defendants she is suing."")."
128,9," HN8[
] The Supreme Court and the Sixth Circuit have repeatedly confirmed that antitrust principles are equally applicable to 
RICO cases. See Cty. of Oakland v. City of Detroit, 866 F.2d 839, 845 (6th Cir. 1989) (""Although we have focused primarily 
on the antitrust laws in the foregoing discussion, most of what we have said is applicable also to the treble damage provision of 
RICO, 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), a provision patterned directly on § 4 of the Clayton Act""). "
155,1," Unless otherwise defined in this Preliminary Approval Order, the capitalized terms used herein shall have the same meaning as 
in the Settlement Agreement. The Settlement Agreement is attached as Exhibit A to Subscriber Plaintiffs' Memorandum of Law 
in Support of their Motion for Preliminary Approval of the Settlement Agreement. (Doc. # 2610-2). The term ""Action"" means: 
lawsuits brought by persons and entities within the Settlement Classes and consolidated in In re Blue Cross Blue Shield Antitrust 
Litigation, 2:13-cv-20000-RDP, MDL No. 2406, including the Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint, which is currently 
pending in the court; all actions that may be transferred or consolidated prior to the time Class Notice is mailed; and all actions 
that are otherwise based, in whole or in part, on the conduct alleged in MDL No. 2406, including Piercy v. Health Care Service 
Corp., Case No. 124-28, in the Circuit Court for the First Judicial Circuit, Union County, Illinois. "
156,2," Mr. Feinberg is a highly respected mediator who is preeminent in the field of settlement allocations. He has worked on such 
matters as the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund, the Troubled Asset Relief Program, and the BP Deepwater Horizon 
Disaster Victim Compensation Fund, just to name a few. "
157,3, It is rare for historic structural relief such as that negotiated here to arise out of private enforcement actions. 
160,4," HN6[
] The 2018 amendments to Rule 23 imposed a heightened standard on counsel seeking preliminary approval of a proposed settlement. Now, before notice of a proposed settlement is given to a class, counsel must provide the court with ""a 
solid record supporting the conclusion that the proposed settlement will likely earn final approval after notice and an opportunity 
to object."" Committee Notes on Fed. R. Civ P. 23, 2018 Amendment. Specifically, counsel must demonstrate the proposed 
settlement passes procedural and substantive hurdles. Rule 23(e)(2)(A-B) requires counsel demonstrate the proposed 
settlement has satisfied certain ""'procedural' concerns,"" and Rule 23(e)(2)(C-D) requires the proposed settlement satisfy a 
""'substantive' review."" Id. The 2018 amendments were promulgated after extensive review by the Advisory Committee on Civil Rules. See Advisory 
Committee on Civil Rules (Apr. 25-26, 2017), available at https://www.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/2017-04-civil-
agenda_book.pdf. Judge John D. Bates of the District of Columbia and Judge Robert M. Dow, Jr. of the Northern District of 
Illinois ably served as Chair of the Advisory Committee on Civil Rules and as Chair of the Rule 23 Subcommittee, respectively. 
Academics and practitioners have acknowledged that the 2018 amendments have brought about helpful and necessary changes 
to class action litigation. See, e.g., Rhonda Wasserman, The New, Improved Class Action Rule: The December 2018 
Amendments to Rule 23, 90 Pa. Bar Ass'n Q. 182 (2019). "
166,5," Although the Blues previously objected to a Litigation Class, they clarified at the preliminary approval hearing that they are not 
objecting to a Settlement Class because somewhat different standards apply to settlement-only class certification. (Doc. # 2626 
at 123-23). See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e); see also Amchem, 521 U.S. at 620 (articulating different standard for settlement-only class 
certification); Carrera v. Bayer Corp., 727 F.3d 300, 311 (3d Cir. 2013) (""There are different standards for approving a settlement 
class than for certifying a litigation class.""). "
167,6," An MFN Differential is ""an MFN which requires that the Provider offer a health plan financial terms that are more favorable by a 
specified rate than those it offers any comparable health plan during the performance period of the contract."" (Doc. 2610-2 & 
1(bbb)). "
171,7," These class members, through their counsel, have access to the court docket. The court is confident there is sufficient 
information from which they can properly evaluate whether to preliminarily approve this settlement. The docket contains the 
Complaints, the briefing on various substantive Motions, the court's rulings on those Motions, expert reports, and all of the 
extensive information filed in support of the Motion for Preliminary Approval and related filings. (Docs. # 2610, 2611, 2612, 2616, 
2625). "
172,8, https://www.alnd.uscourts.gov/sites/alnd/files/forms/ADR%20Plan.pdf.
172,9," Mr. Cowan argues that, by failing to produce the mediation materials, Subscriber Plaintiffs' Class Counsel have violated ethical 
obligations to certain class representatives. (Doc. # 2726 at 2-4). He supports this argument by citing California, Texas, New 
York, Washington, DC, and Minnesota bar association opinions and state court decisions applying state ethical rules. (Doc. # 
2627 at 3-4). HN37[
] However, these rules and opinions do not apply in this action because federal courts are permitted to adopt their own ethical standards. See In re Employment Discrimination Litig. Against Alabama, 453 F. Supp. 2d 1323, 1331 
(M.D. Ala. 2001) (citing In re Snyder, 472 U.S. 634, 645 n.6, 105 S. Ct. 2874, 86 L. Ed. 2d 504 (1985). The Northern District of 
Alabama has adopted the ""Alabama Rules of Professional Conduct ... and, to the extent not inconsistent [with those rules], the 
American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct...."" N.D. Ala. L.R. 83.1(f). Therefore, authorities applying state 
ethical rules from states other than Alabama are not relevant in this action. Mr. Cowan cites to an opinion by the Alabama Bar Association for the proposition that counsel must produce ""a copy of the 
entire [client] file upon the client's request."" (Doc. # 2726 at 3). But, even though this court's local rules have adopted the 
Alabama Rules of Professional Conduct, this court is not bound by state court application of those rules, let alone the Alabama 
Bar Association's opinion of the rules. See In re Employment Discrimination Litig. Against Alabama, 453 F. Supp. 2d at 1331 
(citing Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Bolger, 2 F.3d 1304, 1316 (3d Cir. 1993)). But, neither the Alabama Rules of Professional Conduct 
nor the American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct override circumstances where counsel are not permitted 
to disclose confidential files. For example, there are instances where litigation documents are designated attorney's eyes only. 
The court's mediation order and practices are clear. Documents that are exchanged in mediation are confidential. This does not mean that this court does not regulate the conduct of the lawyers before it. But here, Mr. Cowan down plays the 
importance of the mediation privilege. Mediation in this litigation spanned over two years, 150 in-person meetings, over 280 
remote mediation sessions, and produced this proposed settlement. (See Doc. # 2626 at 9). See Vista Healthplan, Inc. v. 
Warner Holdings Co. III, 246 F.R.D. 349, 357 (HN38[
] ""[T]here is a long-standing judicial attitude favoring class action 
settlements, and the Court's discretion is constrained by the principle of preference favoring and encouraging settlement in 
appropriate cases."") (internal quotation markets omitted). In other words, allowing Mr. Cowan to wedge certain state rules of 
ethics into this court's mediation order would ""interfere with the national policies that underlie the federal class action device."" 
Cty. of Suffolk v. Long Island Lighting Co., 710 F. Supp. 1407, 1415 (E.D.N.Y. 1989). "
174,10," The same provision of the Settlement Agreement also releases ""any issue raised in any of the Subscriber Actions by pleading 
or motion."" (Doc. # 2610-2 ¶ uuu). Interestingly enough, none of the causes of action mentioned in Mr. Cowan's brief were 
pleaded in this action. "
178,11," Further, Class Counsel relied on the expert analysis of Mr. Chodorow and the Brattle Group to assist in developing and 
evaluating the economic reasonableness of the Default option. (Doc. # 2610-6 ¶ 34). "

Report at 10) "
191,5," Abbreviated New Drug Application (""ANDA"")."
191,6," As Plaintiffs correctly explain: [T]he post-launch patent litigation settlement here [between Amgen and Teva] occurred after a non-infringement ruling in 
Teva's favor, significantly reducing Teva's risk of paying damages and incentivizing Amgen to pay Teva in order to maintain 
its monopoly. The non-infringement finding was not, however, without its risk. Amgen could, and did, appeal. (Objections at 3 & n.13) (internal footnote omitted) "
193,7," Antitrust scholar Herbert Hovenkamp has explained how a patent settlement does not present a typical per se antitrust 
violation. See Herbert Hovenkamp, Sensible Antitrust Rules for Pharmaceutical Competition, 39 U.S.F.L.R. 11, 19-20 (2004). 
The per se rule ""is reserved for a small subset of offenses that have been found to be clearly anticompetitive on a number of 
occasions. . . . [When a type of challenged restraint] is virtually always anticompetitive, from that point on the restraint can be 
condemned simply upon proof that is has occurred."" Id. ""By contrast, the 'rule of reason' is reserved for types of practices that 
are facially ambiguous. . . . The practice might be anticompetitive under some circumstances but not others. . . . Or a practice, 
while prima facie anticompetitive, may have perfectly innocent or procompetitive explanations that can be raised as defenses."" 
Id. at 20. In the patent context, settlements ""should be subject to"" a rule of reason analysis. Id. at 22. ""[T]here are good reasons 
for courts to encourage good faith settlements,"" even though such settlements ""may not be as competitive as [an outcome] 
where the patent is declared invalid and the infringement defendant plus anyone else who wants to may now enter competition 
with the patentee."" Id. at 23. "
194,8," See also generally Response at 3 (Defendants stating Actavis ""endorses compromise entry dates and puts them to antitrust 
scrutiny, under the rule of reason, only when they are accompanied by some 'reverse payment,'"" thereby effectively 
acknowledging that where — as here — Court has found plausible allegations of reverse payment as well as agreed-upon early "
195,," entry date and acceleration of such date upon third-party generic entry, rule of reason antitrust scrutiny is required by Actavis) 
(internal emphasis omitted)."
195,9," The Court does not agree with Plaintiffs' unwarranted assertion that Judge Hall ""improperly atomized the components"" of the 
challenged settlement agreement, considering them in a ""piecemeal"" fashion rather than ""holistically."" (Objections at 1, 5 & n.20, 
8) The Report expressly and repeatedly stated that it was evaluating Plaintiffs' challenges as a whole, finding them deficient 
whether viewed ""alone or viewed together."" (Report at 22; see also id. at 17) Plaintiffs provide no support for their suggestion 
that the Court should reject Judge Hall's statement that she followed the appropriate holistic approach. See generally In re 
Loestrin 24 Fe Antitrust Litig., 433 F. Supp. 3d 274, 322 (D.R.I. 2019) (stating that reverse payment claims must ""be considered 
holistically to determine [their] alleged effect[s] on competition""). "
196,10," See Cipla Ltd. v. Amgen Inc., 386 F. Supp. 3d 386, 396 n.25 (D. Del. 2019) (describing allegation that Amgen-Teva settlement 
agreement constituted patent misuse because of, inter alia, ""the fact that Amgen and Teva structured their agreement so that 
both make more money the longer the market remains free of other generic competition""), aff'd, 778 Fed. App'x 135 (3d Cir. 
2019)."
196,11," The Court recognizes that in connection with denying Amgen's motion for a preliminary injunction to enjoin Cipla from 
launching its generic product at risk, the Court stated: ""it seems plausible that Amgen and Teva may have colluded to divide up 
the market for cinacalcet, in order to share supracompetitive profits and deter true generic competition. This collusion, if proven, 
could be an antitrust violation under a rule of reason analysis."" Cipla Ltd. v. Amgen Inc., 386 F. Supp. 3d 386, 396 (D. Del. 
2019), aff'd, 778 Fed. App'x 135 (3d Cir. 2019) (internal footnote omitted). The Court believes today's decision is not inconsistent 
with its earlier statement. As an initial matter, the statement in the preliminary injunction opinion was dicta. More importantly, the 
Court's speculation that a plausible claim might be stated has now run into the actual claims Plaintiffs have attempted to state 
and Plaintiffs' efforts to do so are deficient, as explained in this Order. Furthermore, events that post-date the Court's preliminary 
injunction ruling (e.g., Cipla's at-risk launch and that of yet another generic competitor) detract even more from the plausibility of 
Plaintiffs' claims. (See Response at 2 n.3) "
197,12," See also Janssen Pharmaceutica, NV v. Apotex, Inc., 540 F.3d 1353, 1356-57 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (describing Hatch-Waxman 
Act provisions creating potential 180-day period of exclusivity as incentive for first generic manufacturer to file ANDA)."
197,13," The Court notes the fact (which was litigated extensively in this Court, including in the Cipla action (C.A. No. 19-44) that was 
part of this multi-district litigation) that other generic drug companies, including Cipla and Aurobindo, did in fact launch their 
generic cinacalcet hydrochloride products, further demonstrating the implausibility of Plaintiffs' allegations on this point. (See, 
e.g., DPP Compl. ¶¶ 95-96) (Cipla and Aurobindo launches) These undisputed realities corroborate the Court's conclusions, 
although they are not necessary to the Court's ruling. Even if ignored, the Court would reach the same conclusion as it does in 
this Order. "
199,1," RJ Defendants' Motion to Dismiss is joined by Defendants Sheldon Adelson and Patrick Dumont. (Adelson and Dumont 
Joinder, ECF No. 22) (""Messrs. Adelson and Dumont further join in the concurrently-filed motion to dismiss filed by Defendants 
Las Vegas Review-Journal, Inc. and News+Media Capital Group, LLC.""). "
200,2," In addition, LVS separately filed Exhibits 6, 8, and 11, (ECF No. 109), in support of its Response. "
201,3, Jason Taylor is not a party to the instant action.
201,4," EBITDA means ""earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization."" "
206,5," The RJ Defendants, however, do not identify any particular claim which they contend is based on the state court action. (See 
id.). "
208,6," Adelson and Dumont's Motion to Dismiss also argues that the Complaint fails to allege any facts supporting any Defendant's 
involvement in an antitrust conspiracy. (Adelson Dumont MTD 6:14-8:11). Given that the conspiracy to monopolize claim has 
been dismissed, the Court does not reach this argument. "
209,7," The Court further notes that Adelson and Dumont fail to cite a court decision holding that divestiture may never be granted as a 
remedy for violations of § 2 of the Sherman Act that do not involve an illegal acquisition. "
215,1," Because neither party suggests that Alpha is a public figure, I do not consider the law of defamation applicable to such figures."
215,2," I do not reach Philips' argument that the challenged statements must be immune because they were made during a judicial 
proceeding, or Alpha's retort, that immunity does not protect those who distribute a complaint to a third party. Should Alpha 
amend its counterclaim complaint and again present a defamation claim, Philips may renew this argument. "

244,1," Lopez is a resident and citizen of California, and BANA is a citizen of North Carolina. Compl. ¶¶ 16-17. "
247,2," At the hearing on this motion, Plaintiff raised an argument for the first time that since the lender, but not the agent, is required to 
complete Form 159 when the agent's fee is paid by the lender, Congress must not have intended to require submission of the 
form in connection with PPP loans. HN22[
] The Court ordinarily declines to consider arguments made for the first time at a 
motion hearing. Day v. Sears Holdings Corp., 930 F. Supp. 2d 1146, 1168 n.84 (C.D. Cal. 2013). In any event, whether it was 
Form 159 or something else, Lopez was still required to submit a written compensation agreement to the SBA. 13 C.F.R. § 
103.5. "
250,3," The Ninth Circuit rejected the Camacho test in Lozano v. AT & T Wireless Servs., Inc., limiting application of that test to claims 
of unfair competition between direct competitors. 504 F.3d 718, 736 (9th Cir. 2007). "
257,**," This summary constitutes no part of the opinion of the court. It has been prepared by court staff for the convenience of the 
reader. "
258,*," The Honorable Timothy M. Burgess, Chief United States District Judge for the District of Alaska, sitting by designation. "
263,1," Does also try to fashion a failure-to-accommodate claim pursuant to Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the Unruh Act by 
piecing together allegations from their complaint and statements from the district court's order. HN12[
] Because this theory 
was raised for the first time on appeal, we do not address it. See Dream Palace v. City of Maricopa, 384 F.3d 990, 1005 (9th Cir. 
2004)."
263,2," CVS argues this court should also affirm the district court's dismissal of the ACA claim because Does did not adequately allege 
CVS's receipt of ""federal financial assistance."" The district court should address this issue on remand in the first instance."
263,3," The Third, Fifth, and Sixth Circuits are in accord. See Ford v. Schering-Plough Corp., 145 F.3d at 613 (3d Cir. 1998); McNeil v. 
Time Ins. Co., 205 F.3d 179, 188 (5th Cir. 2000) (""[W]e read Title III to prohibit an owner, etc., of a place of public 
accommodation from denying the disabled access to the good or service and from interfering with the disableds' full and equal 
enjoyment of the goods and services offered. But the owner, etc., need not modify or alter the goods and services that it offers in 
order to avoid violating Title III.""); Parker v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 121 F.3d 1006, 1012 (6th Cir. 1997) (""Title III does not govern 
the content of a long-term disability policy offered by an employer. The applicable regulations clearly set forth that Title III 
regulates the availability of the goods and services the place of public accommodation offers as opposed to the contents of 
goods and services offered by the public accommodation.""). "
268,1," The '578 patent is attached as Exhibit A to Targus' Complaint. (D.I. 1, ex. A) Further citation shall simply be to the ""'578 patent."""
268,2," Subsequent to Victorinox's filing of the notice, Plaintiff submitted a ""response"" to the notice, which it asserted was filed 
""pursuant to"" Rule 7.1.2(b). (D.I. 61 at 1) In fact, Rule 7.1.2(b) provides for no such thing. While Rule 7.1.2(b) allows a party to 
file a notice of supplemental authority, it does not provide for responses or replies to a notice of supplemental authority; instead, 
if a party wishes to file a ""response"" to a notice, it needs to seek leave of Court. Plaintiff did not do so here, and so its ""response"" 
is STRICKEN, as is Victorinox's subsequent reply, (D.I. 62). "
270,3," Federal Circuit law governs the question of whether a party has sufficiently pleaded a claim of inequitable conduct. Cent. 
Admixture Pharm. Servs., Inc. v. Advanced Cardiac Sols., P.C., 482 F.3d 1347, 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2007)."
270,4," ""TSA"" is a reference to the Transportation Security Administration of the United States Department of Homeland Security. An 
""RFI"" is a ""Request for Information."""
270,5," All citations to paragraphs in the Answer herein, unless otherwise noted, are to the portion of the pleading that contains the 
Counterclaims. "
271,6," The Court is not certain that it understands how Plaintiff's ""collaboration"" efforts, standing alone (i.e., were they considered 
separate and apart from the allegations about the TSA RFI itself), are asserted to amount to information that was material to 
patentability (i.e., that but for the failure to disclose such ""collaboration"" efforts, the patent-in-suit would not have issued). (D.I. 36 
at 3-4) Certainly, the Court understands how facts relating to those collaboration efforts are relevant to Targus' receipt of and 
non-disclosure of the TSA RFI—i.e., the piece of asserted prior art that, had it been disclosed, would purportedly have led the 
Examiner to reject the patent. But the Court is less sure that it sees how Counterclaim III sufficiently explains why non-disclosed 
facts relating to the ""collaboration"" efforts themselves would independently give rise to an inequitable conduct claim. In any 
event, because (as is set out further below) the Counterclaim sets out a plausible inequitable conduct claim due to the non-
disclosure of the TSA RFI, the Court need not further address this issue. "
272,7," Counterclaim III does note that Plaintiff filed two provisional applications prior to the date of the filing of the February 13, 2009 
non-provisional application. (D.I. 11 at ¶ 35) These were filed on March 13, 2008 and May 15, 2008, respectively. (D.I. 26 at 3; 
'578 patent at 1) But though the patent itself purports to claim priority to the provisional applications, ('578 patent, col. 1:6-13), it 
is not clear from the record that the invention date was in fact on March 13, 2008 or May 15, 2008. (D.I. 26 at 9 & n.1); see also 
Everki at 6-7. And even if the invention date was March 13, 2008, for example (i.e., the date of the first provisional application), 
Counterclaim III pleads that the TSA RFI was publicly available and known to at least the three inventors prior to that date. (D.I. 
26 at 9); see also Everki at 7 (""Everki therefore alleges that Targus knew of the RFI before the earliest priority date Targus could 
claim [i.e., as of March 6, 2008]—at least on the current record before the Court—and has done more than enough to plead that 
the RFI is prior art."") (emphasis in original). "
273,8," Plaintiff points out that in paragraph 40 of Counterclaim III, Victorinox makes reference to the fact that in the non-provisional 
patent application that led to the issuance of the '578 patent, there are references to TSA ""'screening policies'"" and ""'expedited 
procedures'"" that ""'allow screening'"" of a case like that claimed in the patent. (D.I. 17 at 8-9) It suggests that in light of this 
disclosure, it is ""more plausible that the TSA RFI was not material, and there was no deceptive intent[,]"" because it is 
""implausible that an applicant attempting to hide TSA's contribution would refer to the TSA's screening procedures in the 
application itself."" (Id.) But as the Court noted previously, whether such an inference is ""more plausible"" is not the test here; the 
test is whether Victorinox's allegations are plausible too. Moreover, the Court agrees with Victorinox that these disclosures ""do 
not indicate that the purported invention resulted from review of the TSA RFI[,]"" which is the key thing that Victorinox is 
suggesting was hidden by Plaintiff's inventors and prosecuting attorney. (D.I. 26 at 12); see also Everki at 8 (concluding the 
same and noting that ""[n]othing in the '578 [p]atent hints that the RFI exists or that the TSA specifically collaborated in the design 
of the checkpoint[-]friendly bags."")."
273,9," District courts apply Federal Circuit law to the ""fraudulently obtained"" element of a Walker Process claim and their own regional 
Circuit's law to the pleading of the other elements of antitrust law. See, e.g., Nobelpharma AB v. Implant Innovations, Inc., 141 
F.3d 1059, 1067-68 (Fed. Cir. 1998); see also (D.I. 26 at 14-15 n.2). "
274,10," The parties do not dispute that if the Court finds (as it has) that Victorinox has adequately pleaded inequitable conduct as to 
Counterclaim III and the Third Defense, it has also sufficiently pleaded the fraud component of a Walker Process claim. 
TransWeb, 812 F.3d at 1307; (D.I. 26 at 14; D.I. 36 at 7)."
274,11," Targus argues to the contrary that Victorinox's allegations are wanting because it is ""undisputed that there are other [non-TSA-
compliant] laptop bags and cases on the market."" (D.I. 17 at 12) But even if that is so, the allegations here are that: (1) only 
those bags that are compliant with the TSA RFI will be allowed to pass through airport security without requiring removal of a 
laptop; and (2) there are only a limited number of design options for those types of bags. (D.I. 11 at ¶¶ 30, 47, 62) So the fact 
that ""other laptop bags and cases"" exist that are not TSA compliant does not really affect the Court's analysis here. "
275,12," This is not fatal though, as an antitrust plaintiff is not necessarily required to plead the precise percentage of market share the 
defendant holds in order to make out an attempted monopolization claim. See  [*23] Fidelity Eatontown, LLC v. Excellency 
Enter., LLC, Civil Action No. 3:16-cv-3899-BRM-LHG, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 96368, 2017 WL 2691417, at *4 (D.N.J. June 22, 
2017) (citing Broadcom Corp. v. Qualcomm Inc., 501 F.3d 297, 319 (3d Cir. 2007)). "

313,1," As an initial matter, Counts 2, 7, 9, 14, 16, 22, 28, 33, 35, 40, 42, and 47 do not state a plausible claim because they allege 
claims only against defendants iHeartMedia, Inc., Connoisseur Media LLC, and/or RMLC, which have each been voluntarily 
dismissed with prejudice. See Docs. #112; #140; #172."
313,2," Though PMR also argues that it alleges a per se conspiracy, Doc. #168 at 34-37, its argument is confused and suggests that a 
plaintiff can claim a per se conspiracy simply by reciting the essential elements of a conspiracy. But PMR cannot circumvent the 
plausibility pleading standard simply by labeling its allegations a per se conspiracy. "
318,3," As I conclude that the § 1 claims should be dismissed because PMR does not allege facts amounting to a plausible direct or 
circumstantial claim, I do not address defendants' separate argument that PMR's alleged conspiracy is implausible on its face. 
Doc. #147 at 28-31. "
430,1," These consumer plaintiffs since have abandoned their federal antitrust and state consumer protection law claims. Doc. 2169 at 
43 (Pretrial Order ¶ 4.c.)."
430,2," To the extent this Order refers to the Counterclaim as asserted by ""Mylan,"" the court makes this reference for ease. The court 
recognizes that only Mylan Specialty asserts the Counterclaim as the Counterclaim Plaintiff. Mylan, Inc. is not a party to the 
Counterclaim."
430,3," Sanofi also has submitted four separate filings as supplemental authority for the pending summary judgment motions. Docs. 
1951, 1998, 2005, 2235. Mylan has responded to each filing. Docs. 1954, 2000, 2006, 2237. The court also considers these 
submissions when deciding the parties' summary judgment motions. "
431,4," Sanofi submitted as supplemental authority a public earnings release from Pfizer that, it contends, shows Mylan will continue to 
market the EpiPen after 2020. Doc. 2005. Mylan disagrees with Sanofi's characterization of the public earnings release. Doc. 
2006. But this issue isn't material to the court's resolution of the pending summary judgment motion. "
432,5," Except for the references in this paragraph, the court's references to ""Sanofi"" in all other parts of this Order refer to the named 
plaintiff in this litigation: Sanofi-Aventis U.S. LLC. "
433,6," In 2014, Mylan again considered buying Auvi-Q but concluded that the FTC likely wouldn't allow it to market both the EpiPen 
and Auvi-Q. Doc. 1689-18 at 2, 4 (Mylan email) (noting a plan to buy Auvi-Q wasn't ""viable near term"" and the ""FTC will likely 
force divestiture of [Auvi-Q] anyway""); see also Doc. 1808-6 at 2, 28 (Mylan minutes from a ""brain storming session""). "
434,7," Sanofi objects to Mylan's Statements of Fact that describe, generally, how payors use drug formularies. Sanofi asserts that the 
U.S. EAI market is unique, and Mylan's facts fail to account for how the EAI market differs from other prescription drug markets. 
The court includes Mylan's facts about how formulary placement works to provide a general overview of how prescription drugs 
are sold in the U.S. The court recognizes that this general overview is not exact when discussing how the EAI market works. 
And, where needed, the court explains the unique characteristics present in the EAI market that aren't necessarily reflected in a 
general industry overview. "
435,8," Sanofi asserts that a ""step edit"" isn't a UM tool that's relevant to the EAI market because a ""step edit"" requires a trial of a 
preferred drug and failure. Doc. 1823-29 at 3 (Brodeur Dep. 32:7-13); see also Doc. 1823-30 at 2 (noting in an email from Prime 
Therapeutics that ""a clinical program such as step therapy"" wouldn't be ""consider[ed] appropriate in this class,"" i.e., the EAI 
market). But as discussed infra, a step edit is a UM tool that some payors discussed in their negotiations with Mylan and Sanofi 
about EAI coverage, and eventually implemented in certain EAI formularies. The court includes it in its statement of facts for that 
reason. "
442,9," The ESI rebate offers include the offers listed on the bid grid plus ESI's standard 4.375% administrative fee. See, e.g., Doc. 
1665-1 at 2 (Sanofi/ESI email)."
442,10, These rebate percentages include a 4% administrative fee. Doc. 1662-8 at 21.
442,11, These rebate percentages include a 3% administrative fee. Doc. 1665-7 at 31. 
447,12," Sanofi offered more competitive rebates to Presbyterian than Mylan. Compare Doc. 1668-21 at 2 (Sanofi/Presbyterian Term 
Sheet showing that Sanofi offered a 25% rebate for preferred formulary placement) with Doc. 1668-22 at 2 (Mylan/Presbyterian 
Proposal showing Mylan offered a 15.5% rebate for preferred formulary placement). "
449,13, These rebate percentages include a 4% administrative fee. Doc. 1670-20 at 20.
449,14," As explained above, CVS never excluded Auvi-Q, despite Mylan's offer to pay a 5% incremental rebate for excluding Auvi-Q. "
460,15," More recently, the Tenth Circuit has recited the elements of a § 2 monopolization claim as requiring plaintiff ""to prove three 
items: (1) monopoly power in the relevant market; (2) willful acquisition or maintenance of this power through exclusionary 
conduct; and (3) harm to competition."" Lenox MacLaren Surgical Corp. v. Medtronic, Inc., 762 F.3d 1114, 1119 (10th Cir. 
2014) [**568]  (citing United States v. Grinnell Corp., 384 U.S. 563, 570-71, 86 S. Ct. 1698, 16 L. Ed. 2d 778 (1966) (further 
citations omitted)). "
462,16," The parties do not cite, and the court has not found any case where the Tenth Circuit specified when the price-cost test 
applies to an exclusive dealing claim based on a discount or rebate program. Our court has held that ""an MDL transferee court 
applies the law of the circuit in which it sits."" In re: Syngenta AG Mir 162 Corn Litig., No. 14-md-2591-JWL, 2016 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 135658, 2016 WL 5481997, at *1 n.1 (D. Kan. Sept. 29, 2016). Also, this court has explained that ""[t]his ruling is 
consistent with the rule followed by a number of circuit courts that have considered the question."" Id. (first citing Murphy v. FDIC, 
208 F.3d 959, 965-66 (11th Cir. 2000); then citing In re U.S. Dep't of Defense & U.S. EPA Final Rule, 817 F.3d 261, 272 (6th Cir. 
2016)); see also AER Advisors, Inc. v. Fid. Brokerage Servs., LLC, 921 F.3d 282, 288-89 (1st Cir. 2019) (joining every Circuit 
that has considered the issue by holding that ""the transferee court applies its own Circuit's cases on the meaning of federal 
law""); In re Takata Airbag Prods. Liab. Litig., 464 F. Supp. 3d 1291, 1300 (S.D. Fla. 2020) (""Questions of federal law in cases 
transferred under 28 U.S.C. Section 1407 are governed by the clearly settled law of the transferee court's circuit.""). And, 
although the transferor court's law is not binding precedent, it ""merits close consideration"" by the transferee court. In re Korean 
Air Lines Disaster of Sept. 1, 1983, 829 F.2d 1171, 1176 (D.C. Cir. 1987) [**573] . The court thus considers closely the law of 
the Third Circuit (where the Sanofi case originated) when deciding the parties' cross motions for summary judgment. "
463,17," At the district court level, however, the New Jersey federal court concluded ""that price was the predominant mechanism of 
exclusion"" of the market share discount contracts at issue, and ""thus, the price-cost"" test applied. Eisai Inc. v. Sanofi-Aventis 
U.S., LLC, No. 08-4168 (MLC), 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46791, 2014 WL 1343254, at *30 (D.N.J. Mar. 28, 2014) (citations and 
internal quotation marks omitted). The court explained that under the price-cost test, ""so long as the price is above-cost, the 
procompetitive justifications for, and the benefits of, lowering prices far outweigh any potential anticompetitive effects."" Id. 
(citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Because it was undisputed that Sanofi never sold its drug product below its 
costs to produce it, the court held that plaintiff couldn't ""recover under the antitrust laws, and summary judgment must be 
granted in favor of Sanofi."" Id. The New Jersey court also applied a rule of reason analysis to the plaintiff's exclusive dealing 
claims and concluded the ""result would be the same"" Id.; see also 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46791, [WL] at *30-36. "
464,18," Tampa Electric analyzed a Clayton Act claim and concluded that the contract at issue didn't ""tend to foreclose a substantial 
volume of competition."" 365 U.S. at 335. After reaching that conclusion, the Court found it ""need not discuss the respondents' 
further contention that the contract also violates § 1 and § 2 of the Sherman Act, for if it does not fall within the broader 
prescriptions of § 3 of the Clayton Act it follows that it is not forbidden by those of the former."" Id. Although Tampa Electric 
involved a Clayton Act claim, courts also apply its analysis to exclusive dealing claims asserted under the Sherman Act because 
each statute ""include[s] an anticompetitive conduct element, although each statute articulates that element in a slightly different 
way."" ZF Meritor, 696 F.3d at 269 n.9; see also id. at 327 n.26 (Greenberg, J., dissenting) (""In substance, the Tampa Electric 
standard for Clayton Act Section 3 claims differs very marginally, if at all, from the fact-intensive rule-of-reason analysis that 
applies to this case under Section 1 of the Sherman Act.""); Dos Santos v. Columbus-Cuneo-Cabrini Med. Ctr., 684 F.2d 1346, 
1352 n.11 (7th Cir. 1982) (noting that Tampa Electric applies to Sherman Act cases even though it was decided under § 3 of the 
Clayton Act). "
466,19," Sanofi makes this factual statement in its Memorandum of Law in Support of its Motion for Summary Judgment. Doc. 1686-1 
at 21 (Statement of Undisputed Material Facts ¶ 29). Mylan doesn't controvert this specific fact in its Opposition, though it 
repeatedly objects to how Sanofi has defined the relevant antitrust market. See generally Doc. 1805-1. "
468,20," Sanofi argues that the unique characteristics of EAIs made this drug class inappropriate for formulary management through 
the use of exclusive contracts that limit drug treatment options just to one EAI device ""given the life-threatening nature of 
anaphylaxis and the need for an EAI in an emergency."" Doc. 1820-1 at 79-80. But, this argument ignores that payors 
overwhelmingly concluded that EpiPen and Auvi-Q were therapeutically equivalent products, and thus interchangeable 
treatments for anaphylaxis. See, e.g., Doc. 1663-8 at 4 (ESI); Doc. 1663-9 at 22 (CVS); Doc. 1660-28 at 14 (OptumRx); Doc. 
1663-10 at 13 (Prime); Doc. 1663-11 at 20 (UnitedHealthcare); Doc. 1660-5 at 12 (MedImpact); Doc. 1660-25 at 20-21 (Cigna); 
Doc. 1663-12 at 2 (Aetna); Doc. 1660-27 at 12 (Anthem); Doc. 1663-13 at 2 (Kaiser Permanente). "
469,21," Sanofi also argues that Mylan used its ""ill-gotten gains"" from misclassifying the EpiPen on Medicaid formularies to offer 
significant rebates conditioned on excluding Auvi-Q that it otherwise could not have offered if it had classified the EpiPen 
properly with Medicaid. Doc. 1820-1 at 79. It is undisputed that, in 2017, Mylan agreed to pay $465 million to the Department of 
Justice to resolve claims that it knowingly misclassified the EpiPen as a generic drug to avoid paying rebates owed to Medicaid. 
Doc. 1816-42 at 2 (press release). But, the evidence that Sanofi cites to argue that Mylan couldn't have offered significant 
rebates unless it had misclassified the EpiPen is one email from Mylan to OptumRx where the discussion specifically centered 
around Mylan's Medicaid rebates for OptumRx (not commercial rebates). Doc. 1822-40 at 2 (Mylan email) (recognizing that if 
EpiPen ""had been treated as a brand for Best Price purposes, then [Mylan] could not have rebated the product to OptumRx over 
the past 4 or 5 years"" as it had done ""because it would have been unprofitable"" for Mylan). Sanofi also has submitted, as 
supplemental authority on this issue, an SEC Complaint against Mylan alleging that Mylan failed to disclose timely to investors 
that the DOJ was investigating whether Mylan overcharged Medicaid by misclassifying the EpiPen. Doc. 1951. But, as Mylan 
notes in its response, this Complaint only asserts unproven allegations against Mylan and qualifies as inadmissible hearsay. 
Doc. 1954 at 1 (citing United States v. Klein, No. 16-cr-442(JMA), 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19943, 2017 WL 1316999, at *2 
(E.D.N.Y. Feb. 10, 2017)); see also Klein, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19943, 2017 WL 1316999, at *2-8 (excluding an SEC 
Complaint from evidence as inadmissible hearsay and finding that it didn't qualify for any exception to the hearsay rule including 
that: (1) it wasn't a public record under Fed. R. Evid. 803(8) because it didn't contain ""factual findings"" but instead just mere 
allegations; (2) it didn't qualify as an admission by a party opponent under Rule 801(d)(2); and (3) it didn't fall within Fed. R. 
Evid. 807's residual hearsay exception). Sanofi identifies no other evidence in the record to support its theory that Mylan's 
misclassification of EpiPen with Medicaid allowed it to offer significant rebates to all other payors on their commercial 
formularies. Without such evidence, Sanofi's theory is pure speculation. And, this unsupported theory can't preclude the court 
from entering summary judgment against Sanofi's antitrust claims. "
472,22," Sanofi complains that it was ""forced to offer rebates on Lantus"" just to secure formulary access for Auvi-Q. Doc. 1820-1 at 78. 
In its 2015 contract with ESI—one where Sanofi successfully reversed ESI's exclusion of Auvi-Q—Sanofi asserts that it paid 
""nearly $34 million in discounts alone"" on Lantus. Id. (emphasis omitted). But, Sanofi's complaints ring hollow in the context of its 
antitrust claims. The purpose of the antitrust laws is ""the protection of competition, not competitors."" Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, 370 U.S. 
294, 320, 82 S. Ct. 1502, 8 L. Ed. 2d 510 (1962). Here, the parties' rebating practices provided consumers greater discounts on 
pharmaceutical products—something that benefited consumers. See Atl. Richfield Co. v. USA Petroleum, Co., 495 U.S. 328, 
340, 110 S. Ct. 1884, 109 L. Ed. 2d 333 (1990) (""Low prices benefit consumers regardless of how those prices are set, and so 
long as they are above predatory levels, they do not threaten competition.""). Sanofi's increased rebate offers for Lantus certainly 
didn't harm competition. Just the opposite, they promoted it. "
474,23," Sanofi also argues that it has presented evidence of substantial foreclosure through the percentage of Mylan's non-
contestable or entrenched demand and Dr. Scott Morton's Effective Entrant Burden (""EEB"") test. As discussed in the following 
section, Sanofi cannot survive Mylan's summary judgment motion though its non-contestable market share theory. And, as 
discussed in the court's contemporaneously-filed Order ruling the parties' Daubert motions, the court excludes Dr. Scott Morton's 
EEB theory for two reasons: (1) it's unreliable, and (2) it's not supported by the factual record in this case. "
476,24," In contrast, in Eisai, Sanofi's drug Lovenox had an FDA-approved use ""for treating certain more severe forms of heart attack, 
an indication that [plaintiff's drug] Fragmin does not have."" 821 F.3d at 399. Yet, the Third Circuit still found no evidence to 
support plaintiff's incontestable demand theory because, while ""obtaining an FDA indication requires investing a significant 
amount of time and resources in clinical trials[,]"" plaintiff did not ""offer evidence demonstrating that fixed costs were so high that 
competitors entering the market were unable to obtain a cardiology indication."" Id. at 406. "
477,25," Importantly, these facts differ from the ones alleged in Pfizer. The Pfizer case noted that plaintiff had alleged that it ""offered 
more competitive pricing for [its product][,]"" and if plaintiff could ""prove true"" that allegation ""then the pricing data may indicate 
that [defendant's] conduct has prevented [plaintiff] from competing in violation of the antitrust laws."" Pfizer, 333 F. Supp. 3d at 
505. In contrast here, a case that has reached the summary judgment stage, the undisputed facts reveal Sanofi never was 
excluded or restricted from payors' formularies when it offered lower prices than Mylan offered on the EpiPen. And the summary 
judgment facts show that Sanofi was able to reverse payors' exclusions when it offered more competitive rebates for Auvi-Q."
477,26," Sanofi also urges the court to apply Dr. Scott Morton's Effect Entrant Burden (""EEB"") test to calculate the amount of Mylan's 
non-contestable share that foreclosed competition in the market. But, as discussed, the court excludes Dr. Scott Morton's EEB 
theory because it is unreliable and unsupported by the factual record. So, Sanofi's reliance on the EEB test doesn't save Sanofi's 
antitrust claims from summary judgment. "
479,27," Sanofi also alleges that Mylan shared competitively sensitive rebate information among payors to encourage them to exclude 
Auvi-Q and improperly acquired and used confidential information about Sanofi's marketing. Doc. 1820-1 at 99. The summary 
judgment evidence that Sanofi cites to support these assertions simply doesn't substantiate the claims—and the inferences 
Sanofi asks the court to draw from that evidence are patently unreasonable. See, e.g., Doc. 1820-1 at 29-31, 91, 99. The court 
thus finds no triable issue that Mylan either shared competitive rebate information or improperly obtained and used Sanofi's 
sensitive confidential information. "
484,28," As discussed, supra, Sanofi also seeks summary judgment in its favor on the first element of its Sherman Antitrust Act 
claims—that Mylan possessed monopoly power in the EAI market. But, the court has found that the summary judgment facts 
present no triable issue on other elements those claims—i.e., (1) whether Mylan engaged in anticompetitive conduct violating 
the Sherman Act, or (2) whether Sanofi sustained an antitrust injury sufficient to support Sanofi's Sherman Antitrust Act claims. 
So, Sanofi's Sherman Antitrust Act claims fails as a matter of law. The court thus denies as moot the portion of Sanofi's Motion 
for Summary Judgment seeking judgment in its favor on the first element of its Sherman Act claims. "
485,29," Mylan's Counterclaim includes other allegations. They allege that Sanofi falsely stated that Auvi-Q can withstand higher 
temperatures than EpiPen and that Sanofi offered kick-backs to increase Auvi-Q sales. See Doc. 112 at 47-48 (Mylan 
Counterclaim ¶¶ 55-56, 59-61). Mylan concedes that discovery hasn't revealed sufficient evidence to support these claims. Doc. 
1805-1 at 89 n.320. Although Mylan doesn't say so explicitly, the court finds that Mylan has abandoned these allegations. See 
Hinsdale v. City of Liberal, Kan., 19 F. App'x 749, 768-69 (10th Cir. 2001) (affirming district court's dismissal of plaintiff's equal 
protection claim after it concluded that plaintiff had abandoned the claim because he had not addressed it in his memorandum 
opposing summary judgment); see also C.T. v. Liberal Sch. Dist., 562 F. Supp. 2d 1324, 1337 (D. Kan. 2008) (concluding that 
plaintiff had abandoned his retaliation claim by not responding to defendant's motion for summary judgment against the claim). Also, Mylan's Counterclaim alleges that Sanofi falsely represented that Auvi-Q was bioequivalent to and therapeutically 
interchangeable with the EpiPen. Doc. 112 at 41 (Mylan Counterclaim ¶¶ 32, 35). But its Opposition to Sanofi's summary 
judgment motion doesn't come forward with evidence to support this allegation. Indeed, the Opposition only mentions this 
alleged misrepresentation one time, but it doesn't identify any record evidence where Sanofi made such a misrepresentation. 
Doc. 1805-1 at 96. The Counterclaim asserts that Sanofi used its website to make this alleged misrepresentation. Doc. 112 at 41 
(Mylan Counterclaim ¶ 35). But, the summary judgment record shows that Sanofi's website recited that Auvi-Q's epinephrine 
was bioequivalent to EpiPen's. Doc. 1811-21 at 2 (Auvi-Q website). And, the FDA had concluded that the epinephrine in Auvi-Q 
""demonstrated bioequivalence"" with the epinephrine in EpiPen. Doc. 1816-32 at 6 (""The [pharmacokinetics] trial . . . 
demonstrated bioequivalence . . . .""). So, the website's statements appear consistent with the FDA's finding. Mylan doesn't offer 
any other evidence explaining why the website's statement was false or misleading. Thus, the court doesn't include Mylan's 
allegation that Sanofi falsely misrepresented that Auvi-Q was bioequivalent and thus interchangeable with the EpiPen in its 
analysis above because no evidence in the summary judgment record supports it. "
495,30," The Counterclaim also alleges that Sanofi competed unfairly by offering illicit cash payments to physicians that were intended 
to influence prescribing and purchasing decisions by health care customers. Doc. 112 at 53 (Answer, Affirmative Defenses, and 
Counterclaims ¶ 82). As already discussed, Mylan concedes that discovery hasn't revealed sufficient evidence to support these 
claims. Doc. 1805-1 at 89 n.320. So, the court concludes that Mylan abandons this allegation. See supra note 29. As a 
consequence, this unsubstantiated allegation can't support Mylan's unfair competition claim. "
497,1," Plaintiff filed a similar action on September 10, 2016, against a Checkers Drive-In restaurant, see Trisvan v. Checkers Drive-In 
Rests., Inc., No. 16-CV-7000, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12422, 2019 WL 332177, at *5 (E.D.N.Y. Jan. 25, 2019) (dismissing third 
amended complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction over claims under the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act and the U.C.C.); 
see also Trisvan v. Checkers Drive-In Rests., Inc., No. 16-CV-7000, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 33940, 2020 WL 906635, at *6 
(E.D.N.Y. Feb. 18, 2020) (dismissing fourth amended complaint for failure to state federal claims and lack of standing to bring 
Clayton Act claim and for lack of subject matter jurisdiction over U.C.C. claims), appeal dismissed, No. 20-1271 (2d Cir. Oct. 1, "
498,2020," ), and again on November 6, 2019, against a Burger King restaurant, see Trisvan v. Burger King Corp., No. 19-CV-6396, 
2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 72709, 2020 WL 1975236, at *4 (E.D.N.Y. Apr. 24, 2020) (dismissing amended complaint for lack of 
subject matter jurisdiction over U.C.C. claims and granting leave to file a second amended complaint); Second Amended 
Complaint, Trisvan v. Burger King Corp., No. 19-CV-6396 (E.D.N.Y. May 22, 2020) (asserting claims under the Clayton Act, the 
Sherman Act, the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, and the U.C.C.)."
498,2," Because the Complaint is not consecutively paginated, the Court refers to the page numbers assigned by the electronic case 
filing system."
498,3," Plaintiff states that he went to the hospital on May 6, 2020, which appears to be a typographical error. "
500,4," Plaintiff has previously raised similar antitrust claims in his food poisoning claims against Checkers, see Checkers Drive-In 
Rests., Inc., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 33940, 2020 WL 906635, at *6 (dismissing, inter alia, Plaintiff's Clayton Act claim with 
prejudice for lack of standing), and Burger King, see Second Amended Complaint, supra note 1 (asserting claims under the 
Clayton Act, the Sherman Act, the Magnuson-Moss Warranty act, and the U.C.C.). "
501,5," Plaintiff has previously raised similar MMWA claims in his food poisoning claims against Checkers, see Checkers Drive-In 
Rests., Inc., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 33940, 2019 WL 332177, at *5 (dismissing, inter alia, Plaintiff's MMWA claim), and Burger 
King, see Second Amended Complaint, supra note 1 (asserting claims under the Clayton Act, the Sherman Act, the Magnuson-
Moss Warranty act, and the U.C.C.). "
502,6," Plaintiff alleges that he is a citizen of New York, that KFC is ""headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky,"" and that Yum Brands is 
""based in Louisville, Kentucky,"" although he does not provide an address for Yum Brands. (Compl. 3.) "
508,1," The Hospital Authorities Act was initially known as the Hospital Authorities Law and was formerly codified at N.C.G.S. § 131-90 
to -116 (1943). "
509,2," Although plaintiffs seek to represent a state-wide class in this lawsuit pursuant to Rule 23 of the North Carolina Rules of Civil 
Procedure, the trial court had not ruled on this request at the time it entered the orders which serve as the basis of this appeal."
509,3," On 14 October 2016, Mr. DiCesare filed a first amended complaint to add James Little and Johanna MacArthur as named 
plaintiffs. On 20 November 2017, plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint reflecting the fact that Mr. DiCesare had moved 
and was no longer a resident of North Carolina. On 21 May 2018, Ms. MacArthur voluntarily dismissed her claims against the 
Hospital Authority. On 8 August 2018, plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint adding Diana Stone and Kenneth Fries as 
named plaintiffs. "
511,4," The Sherman Antitrust Act was enacted by Congress in 1890 and prohibits ""contract[s] . . . in restraint of trade or commerce 
among the several States,"" 15 U.S.C. § 1, and ""monopoliz[ing], or attempt[s] to monopolize, . . . any part of the trade or 
commerce among the several States,"" 15 U.S.C. § 2. In 1914, the Sherman Act was modified by the Clayton Antitrust Act, 
which, in pertinent part, provides for the awarding of treble damages to ""[a]ny person who shall be injured in his business or 
property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws."" 15 U.S.C. § 17. "
514,5," In addition, the Hospital Authority points out that it is a quasi-municipal corporation and a ""body corporate and politic,"" citing the 
Hospital Authorities Act, N.C.G.S. § 131E-16, et seq. In light of the fact that plaintiffs do not appear to contest that the Hospital 
Authority is a quasi-municipal corporation or a ""body corporate and politic,"" we refrain from discussing the Hospital Authority's 
arguments with respect to this issue in greater detail. "
519,6," In light of this determination, we need not determine whether the Hospital Authority is entitled to the protections of the state 
action doctrine as it is known in federal antitrust law. "
520,7," The Hospital Authority also asserts that, ""by bringing an Anti-Monopoly Clause claim, [p]laintiffs concede the Hospital Authority 
is a governmental entity,"" despite plaintiffs contentions for the purposes of Chapter 75 that the Hospital Authority was a private 
actor or ""nominally public."" According to the Hospital Authority, plaintiffs were not entitled to assert their monopolization claim if 
the Hospital Authority was not, in fact, ""a unit of government."" "
521,8," In its reply brief, the Hospital Authority states that it ""has not argued that a state actor must eliminate each and every competitor 
or control 100% of the market before an Anti- Monopoly Clause violation occurs,"" and that, instead, ""it is clear after American 
Motors that government actions which merely reduce, but do not eliminate, competition do not cause a violation,"" citing 311 N.C. 
at 317, 317 S.E.2d at 356, and that ""governmental actions . . . must create or lead to the creation of a monopoly."" According to 
the Hospital Authority, while an alleged monopolist need not hold one-hundred percent of the relevant market, the fifty percent 
share alleged in the complaint in this case is clearly insufficient. See [***53]  United States v. Aluminum Co. of America, 148 
F.2d 416, 424 (2d Cir. 1945) (stating that a ninety percent control over the aluminum market ""is enough to constitute a 
monopoly"" but that ""it is doubtful whether sixty or sixty-four percent would be enough; and certainly thirty-three per cent is not""); 
U.S. Dep't of Justice, Competition and Monopoly: Single-Firm Conduct under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, Chapt. 2, n.23 
(2008) (stating that ""lower courts generally require a minimum market share of between 70% and 80%"" to establish monopoly 
power for the purpose of antitrust statutes); Exxon Corp. v. Berwick Bay Real Estate Partners, 748 F.2d 937, 940 (5th Cir. 1984) 
(per curiam) (stating that ""monopolization is rarely found when the defendant's share of the relevant market is below 70%""); 
Bailey v. Allgas, Inc., 284 F.3d 1237, 1250 (11th Cir. 2002) (holding that a ""market share at or less than 50% is inadequate as a 
matter of law to constitute monopoly power""); Blue Cross & Blue Shield United of Wis. v. Marshfield Clinic, 65 F.3d 1406, 1411 
(7th Cir. 1995) (stating that ""[f]ifty percent is below any accepted benchmark for inferring monopoly power from market share""). 
In other words, the Hospital Authority asserts that, ""[w]hile monopoly power certainly carries with it market power, market power 
does not create a monopoly""; thus, ""a plaintiff must allege facts evidencing not just market power, but monopoly power in order 
to state a monopoly claim under State [law],"" citing a number of federal district court decisions—a showing that the Hospital 
Authority asserts that plaintiffs simply did not make. "
523,9," The Hospital Authority correctly notes that, after our decision in Aston Park, the Court of Appeals held in Hope - a Women's 
Cancer Center, P.A. v. State, 203 N.C. App. 593, 607, 693 S.E.2d 673, 683 (2010), that certificate of need laws are "
524,," constitutional. In light of that fact, the Hospital Authority asserts that Aston Park ""has no continuing validity"" and that, even if it 
did, it is otherwise distinguishable from the facts of this case. In light of our agreement that the facts at issue in this case are 
materially different from those at issue in Aston Park, we will refrain from commenting on its ""continuing validity"" in this opinion. "
525,10," In addition, plaintiffs argue that the Hospital Authority waived the right to argue that plaintiffs failed to plead the ""control of 
prices"" element given that the Hospital Authority never set out the elements of the test contained within American Motors before 
the trial court and cannot, for that reason, assert for the first time on appeal that plaintiffs failed to satisfy the fourth element. The 
Hospital Authority responds that it ""clearly argued below that [p]laintiffs had failed to allege sufficient facts to establish a 
monopoly,"" that it did not advocate the application of the American Motors test, and that it could not, for that reason, ""have 
known, prospectively, that the [trial court] would fail to fully apply it."" In light of the fact that the Hospital Authority contended in 
the memorandum of law that it submitted in support of its motion for judgment on the pleadings that ""[p]laintiffs have not alleged 
sufficient facts to support such a claim, and, indeed, have alleged facts in their [t]hird [a]mended [c]omplaint that establish just 
the opposite,"" we are satisfied that the Hospital Authority properly preserved this argument for purposes of appellate review. "
532,," The parties to the instant matter agree that it is appropriate for this Court to do so. See Pl.'s Suppl. Mem. Opp'n Defs.' Mot. 
Dismiss 1, ECF No. 140 (""LifeWatch is content to allow resolution of this question on the pleadings.""); Defs.' Suppl. Mem. Supp. 
Mot. Dismiss 1, ECF No. 139 (""[T]he parties agree that the McCarran argument before the Court is a legal question that can be 
decided now.""). "
533,," Accordingly, the Court will proceed to address the issue at this stage and finds no reason to convert the motion to dismiss to a 
motion for summary judgment."
533,3," HN4[
] As required at the motion to dismiss stage, the Court accepts all well-pled factual allegations as true. See Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007). "
536,4," The Third Circuit also applied the teachings of Royal Drug and Pireno in Ticor Title Ins. Co. v. FTC, 998 F.2d 1129 (3d Cir. 
1993). In Ticor, the court determined that title insurance companies' collective establishment of title search and examination 
rates did not satisfy the ""business of insurance"" prong of McCarran-Ferguson. The court reasoned that, like the processes in 
Pireno and Royal Drug, ""title search and examination has nothing to do with the actual performance of the title insurance 
contract. Instead, the title search and examination is 'a matter of indifference to the policyholder, whose only concern is whether 
his claim is paid, not why it is paid.'"" Ticor, 998 F.2d at 1136 (quoting Pireno, 458 U.S. at 132). Accordingly, the court determined 
that the challenged rate setting activities did not constitute the business of insurance. The instant case, unlike Royal Drug, Pireno, and Ticor, involves the allocation of risk (denial of coverage of telemetry services) 
between the insured and the insurer via the contract for coverage. See Royal Drug, 440 U.S. at 213; Pireno, 458 U.S. at 130; 
Ticor, 998 F.2d at 1136. "
537,5," To the extent that LifeWatch quarrels with the medical wisdom of Blue Cross excluding telemetry monitors from the basket of 
services it offers its subscribers, redress for this alleged wrong lies, if at all, not in the federal antitrust laws but with the 
insurance authorities in the respective states where LifeWatch may find relief. See infra Section IV.B. "
538,6," In In re Ins. Brokerage, 618 F.3d at 351, the Third Circuit recognized that HN13[
] a court ""cannot reflexively transplant"" a holding addressing the first clause of section 2(b) to the second clause: Defendants overlook, however, an important distinction between Sabo and this case. Because Sabo involved a RICO 
rather than an antitrust claim, it was governed by the first clause of § 2(b) of the McCarran—Ferguson Act. That clause 
provides that ""[n]o Act of Congress shall be construed to invalidate, impair, or supersede any law enacted by any State for 
the purpose of regulating the business of insurance . . . unless such Act specifically relates to the business of insurance."" 
15 U.S.C. § 1012(b). This ""first clause . . . impos[es] what is, in effect, a clear-statement rule, a rule that state laws enacted 
'for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance' do not yield to conflicting federal statutes unless a federal statute 
specifically requires otherwise."" United States Dep't of Treasury v. Fabe, 508 U.S. 491, 113 S. Ct. 2202, 124 L. Ed. 2d 449 
(1993). Both clauses incorporate the phrase ""business of insurance,"" but as the Supreme Court has emphasized, the 
respective protections afforded to state [**20]  law under the two clauses are of different scopes. ""The first clause commits 
laws 'enacted . . . for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance' to the States, while the second clause exempts 
only 'the business of insurance' itself from the antitrust laws."" Id. at 504. Because ""[t]he broad category of laws enacted 'for 
the purpose of regulating the business of insurance' . . . necessarily encompasses more than just the business of 
insurance,"" id. at 505, judicial determinations made when applying one clause may not be dispositive when applying the 
other. As Sabo itself explained, ""Fabe makes clear [that] HN14[
] the Royal Drug test is only a starting point in the analysis for non-antitrust cases."" 137 F.3d at 191 n.3; see also Jonathan R. Macey & Geoffrey P. Miller, The McCarran—
Ferguson Act of 1945: Reconceiving the Federal Role in Insurance Regulation, 68 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 13, 22 (1993) (""[I]t 
appears that the meaning of [the 'business of insurance'] varies depending upon whether the case involves antitrust [i.e., 
clause two] or other regulatory [i.e., clause one] matters.""). Accordingly, we cannot reflexively transplant Sabo's holding into 
our analysis under the second clause of § 2(b). Id. at 360 (alterations in original) (citations omitted). "
539,7," Blue Cross points to the following statutes and regulations, inter alia: California: Cal. Ins. Code § 10403 (""General Regulation of Health Insurers""); id. §§ 790-790.15 (""Unfair Practices"") Colorado: Colo. Rev.

545,1," Defendants' opposition addressed former Plaintiff Creative Artists Agency's (""CAA"") Motion for Preliminary Injunction which 
was mooted by the parties' notice of settlement and the Court's dismissal. (See Dkt. Nos. 226, 238.) "
551,1," Epic has provided its first set of RFPs as Exhibit 1 to the joint discovery letter brief. Apple reports in its section of the letter brief 
that Epic has served a total of 83 RFPs. At the hearing Epic explained that its current motion relates only to the first 70 RFPs, 
but that the same dispute concerning geographic scope of Apple's production also applies to the other RFPs not currently before 
the Court. "
552,2," The Court has also reviewed Epic's meet and confer correspondence that was attached to the joint discovery letter brief. That 
correspondence added nothing of substance on this issue. "
554,3," As to the worldwide reach of RFP 3, the Court's analysis in section A applies. Epic has not explained why Apple should have to 
produce this information for every country in the world. The parties did not discuss whether Apple actually has this information 
for each country in the world."
554,4," Epic refers to RFP 30 in its portion of the letter brief. However, neither side presents arguments concerning that RFP. "
564,1," Kira Monterrey's last name was Serna when this action was first initiated. SCAC, ECF No. 94 at 1 n.1 "
567,2," Because the Cartwright Act was modeled after the Sherman Act, the Court's analysis addresses both statutes together 
pursuant to federal antitrust law. See, e.g., County of Tuolumne v. Sonora Cmty. Hosp., 236 F.3d 1148, 1160 (9th Cir. 2001). "
569,3," Plaintiffs argue that ""[t]he law does not require . . . the word 'agreement' to find liability"" and that ""a knowing wink can mean 
more than words."" ECF No. 117 at 67 (citing Esco Corp. v. United States, 340 F.2d 1000, 1007 (9th Cir. 1965)). That may be so, 
but Plaintiffs must still allege a ""wink"" or its equivalent, see Esco Corp., 340 F.2d at 1007, which they do not do for the bail 
agency Defendants. Moreover, it is not clear how the bail agencies could have participated in an agreement to submit uniform 
premium rates to CDI given that, as the SCAC acknowledges, sureties — not bail agencies — are responsible for submitting 
proposed rates. See SCAC ¶ 60; Cal. Ins. Code § 1861.05."
569,4," Because Plaintiffs concede that their UCL claim ""is predicated on Defendants' Sherman Act and Cartwright Act violations,"" ECF 
No. 117 at 67, the Court addresses all three claims together."
569,5," The Court acknowledges that the present order conflicts in some respects with its prior order granting in part and denying in 
part Defendants' first motion to dismiss. See, e.g., ECF No. 91 at 26-27 (holding that the CAC sufficiently alleged ""CBAA's 
participation in the asserted conspiracy.""). To that extent, the Court has reconsidered its prior ruling in light of the absence of 
allegations regarding CBAA's participation in any agreement. "
572,6," Defendants also argue that Plaintiffs ""conflate[] profits with loss ratios,"" exhibiting ""fundamental misapprehensions regarding 
how surety bonds work."" ECF No. 112 at 28-29. Since the SCAC alleges multiple market factors in addition to loss ratios (as well 
as the other plus factors discussed above), the Court defers an evaluation of the proper means of assessing profit margins in 
California's bail bond surety market until a later stage of the proceedings."
572,7," For the purposes of this motion to dismiss, the Court takes as true Plaintiffs' allegation that the California bail bonds market, 
which includes at least 20 different sureties, is ""highly concentrated."" See SCAC ¶ 85; Knievel, 393 F.3d at 1072. "
576,8," See note 4, supra."
576,9," HN19[
] Rule 11 has a safe harbor provision requiring a party seeking sanctions to serve a copy of the motion on the non- moving party at least 21 days before filing the motion, so that ""the challenged paper, claim, defense, contention, or denial [may 
be] withdrawn or appropriately corrected . . . ."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(c)(2). All-Pro complied with this provision by serving Plaintiffs a 
copy of the instant motion on June 8, 2020, see ECF No. 113 at 10-11, and Plaintiffs do not object to the motion on this ground. "
589,1," The TTAB is an office of the USPTO that hears and decides adversary proceedings involving oppositions to trademark 
registration, petitions to cancel trademark registrations, and proceedings involving applications for concurrent use registrations of 
trademarks. See U.S. PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE, Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, https://www.uspto.gov/about-
us/organizational-offices/trademark-trial-and-appeal-board (last updated November 18, 2019). "
598,2," PBTM defines ""Products"" as goods and services listed under International Classes 14, 16, 18, 24 and 25 for trademark 
registration, which include jewelry, paper goods and printed matter, leather and imitation leather goods, travel bags and 
umbrellas, textiles and textile goods, bed and table covers, and clothing, footwear and headwear. See Dkt. #26 at ¶ 46, n.6. "
607,1," Apple, but not Intel, has dismissed its claims against Seven. See Docket Nos. 219-20 (stipulation and order). "
608,2," In their opposition, Plaintiffs repeatedly assert that the 13 markets are ""exemplar[s]."" Opp'n at 1. Presumably, this is because 
Plaintiffs take the position that Defendants have ""obscured information regarding their patent holdings."" Opp'n at 7. 
Nevertheless, at this juncture, the Court shall not allow Plaintiffs to claim markets beyond the 13 specified. "
609,3," According to Plaintiffs, there are additional patents that are ""complements to, and possibly substitutes for,"" the above five 
patents. FAC ¶ 136; see also FAC ¶¶ 137-40 (referring to the '744 patent currently owned by Seven and the '579 patent 
originally owned by Huawei and currently owned by INVT). For all 13 product markets, Plaintiffs suggest that they cannot detail all of the patents that have been aggregated because 
Defendants have obfuscated ownership of patents. See Opp'n at 16 (arguing that ""Defendants' obfuscation — including failing to 
disclose PAEs' connections to Fortress — impedes Plaintiffs, without discovery, form specifically identifying all substitute patents 
that are now controlled by Defendants""). "
610,4," According to Plaintiffs, they asked VLSI permission to disclose the specific damages estimate for alleged infringement of the 
'014 patent (""as well as the financial terms of [the] purchase of the patent from NXP (which had merged with Freescale)""), but 
VLSI refused to consent. FAC ¶ 228. "
612,5," Plaintiffs indicate that ""SSOs typically make no evaluation of whether a claimed-essential patent is actually essential."" FAC ¶ 
396."
612,6," In their opposition, Plaintiffs clarified that they are asserting only bilateral conspiracies between each PAE and Fortress (i.e., 
not an overarching conspiracy involving all Defendants). However, the precise scope and nature of the bilateral conspiracies is 
still somewhat ill-defined. For example, are Plaintiffs claiming that each PAE worked with Fortress to aggregate the patents the 
PAE has? Or is that that PAE knew Fortress would aggregate the PAE's patents with another PAE's patents in the same market 
(i.e., the PAE was just contributing to Fortress's ""pot of patents,"" so to speak)? Or is it both? Whether antitrust injury is 
adequately alleged may turn in part on the nature of the asserted conspiracies. "
618,7," At the hearing, Plaintiffs seemed to admit that their allegations in the FAC of restricted output were largely conclusory. See, 
e.g., FAC ¶ 141 (simply referring to ""inflated royalties and decreased licensing output"" without providing more information on 
how licensing output has decreased). Plaintiffs suggested, however, that there was restricted output because, through 
aggregation of patents, Defendants eliminated substitutes. The Court has concerns about this theory. Even if Defendants' 
aggregation eliminated substitutes, see FAC ¶ 165 (alleging that, ""because of Defendants' unlawful aggregation of patent rights, 
Defendants now control both substitute technologies, making such competition impossible""), that does not necessarily mean that 
there was less licensing post-aggregation. For example, a given defendant could have extended a license on a patent plus a 
license for all of the substitutes for that patent. "
620,8," The Court acknowledges that Plaintiffs are not relying on indirect evidence of anticompetitive effects, for which they would have 
to show high market share (e.g., that Defendants owned a significant number of patents in the relevant product market). That 
does not mean, however, that information about the number of patents Defendants hold, or the ""quality"" of those patents, is 
insignificant where Plaintiffs are relying on a direct evidence theory. Plaintiffs must still show that the supracompetitive pricing is 
due to the aggregation of patent substitutes."
620,9," The Court does not condone Plaintiffs' failure to provide this information to the Court. Plaintiffs could have, but did not, asked 
the courts presiding over the VLSI infringement suits against Intel for relief from the protective order so that they could make a 
filing under seal in this case. "
621,10," Based on the Court's ruling above, it does not address Defendants' other arguments, such as those on antitrust injury and 
those specific to the § 1 claim. The Court, however, notes, that for the § 1 claim, Plaintiffs do not simply need to ""allege that the 
[relevant] defendant intended to enter the agreement, and the agreement was anticompetitive."" Opp'n at 33 (emphasis in 
original). HN8[
] Rather, Plaintiffs must allege that the agreement was intended to harm or restrain trade. See Brantley v. NBC Universal, Inc., 675 F.3d 1192, 1197 (9th Cir. 2012) (noting that a plaintiff must prove, inter alia, a contract or conspiracy by 
which the persons or entities ""'intended to harm or restrain trade'""). Furthermore, Plaintiffs must have nonconclusory allegations 
to support such an intention. "
628,1," The Complaint separately asserted a Count Two, which alleged a vertical agreement between Fjallraven and Netrush in 
violation section 1 of the Sherman Act to be analyzed under the rule of reason. (Compl't ¶¶ 98-109.) In its opposition brief, 
Victory abandons this claim. (Pl. Mem. at 20 (""Upon review of defendants [sic] brief and additional research and analysis, plaintiff 
withdraws and will no longer pursue its rule of reason claim."").) "
631,2," Though it need not reach the issue, the Court separately notes that the Complaint fails in several respects to plausibly allege 
an unlawful restraint of trade under a rule of reason analysis, and that such a claim likely would have been dismissed. The 
Complaint does not coherently define a relevant product market: It is unclear whether the proposed market is defined as all 
online retail sales of Fjallraven, the market for Fjallraven products on Amazon, or all retail commerce on Amazon itself. (Compl't 
¶¶ 26, 99, 100.) The Complaint does not describe any broader effect on the market in backpack sales. The Complaint fails to 
plausibly allege antitrust injury, and details the economic loss specific to Victory, including lost profits, marketing expenses, 
storage costs and ""dead inventory."" (Compl't ¶ 97.) See, e.g., NYNEX, 525 U.S. at 135 (""the plaintiff here must allege and prove 
harm, not just to a single competitor, but to the competitive process, i.e., to competition itself.""). The Complaint identifies a 
subsequent increase in price of Fjallraven backpacks among third-party sellers on Amazon (Compl't ¶ 88) but does not identify 
any effect on interbrand competition. The Complaint expressly alleges that only Victory and no other seller was injured by 
defendants' actions. (Compl't ¶ 89.) For these and other reasons, Victory's claim invoking the rule of reason likely would have 
been dismissed, had it not been abandoned. "
637,1," Plaintiff has not reasserted the monopolization claim under section 2 of the Sherman Act that he asserted in Count II of his 
original complaint. "
639,2," Plaintiff insists in his briefs that he has not alleged that MOC is a ""component"" of certification; rather, plaintiff argues, he has 
specifically alleged that MOC is a separate product, and any suggestion that it is a component is a denial of his allegations, 
which is inappropriate at the pleading stage. The Court disagrees. HN6[
] Whether MOC is a component of certification or a 
separate product from certification is a legal conclusion, and the Court is not required to assume that the legal conclusions a 
plaintiff articulates in a complaint are correct. See Alam, 709 F.3d at 665-66 (citing Brooks, 578 F.3d at 581). The Court's task is 
to determine, setting aside legal conclusions, whether plaintiff has pleaded sufficient factual matter, assumed true, to permit a 
court to draw a plausible inference that MOC and initial certification are separate products. As the Court explains in this Opinion, 
given the substance of plaintiff's own factual allegations of the nature of ABR's certification product, no such inference is 
plausible. "
640,3," In a similar vein, plaintiff relies on the Seventh Circuit's recent decision in Viamedia, Inc. v. Comcast Corp., 951 F.3d 429, 470 
(7th Cir. 2020), but that section 2 monopolization case is distinguishable for a number of reasons, including that there was 
evidence that the defendant sold the products in question separately in certain markets. See id. (citing evidence of ""other 
[regions] where [the defendant] sells Interconnect services separately.""). Here, plaintiff has not made plausible allegations to the 
same effect. 4 Plaintiff argues in sur-reply that Areeda and Hovenkamp criticized the reasoning of Klamath, see Areeda & 
Hovenkamp ¶ 1745g4, but plaintiff overreads this criticism, which was not directed at the court's approach to the issue of 
separate billing, specifically, but at the court's approach to the bundling of health insurance and medical goods more generally. 
That aspect of the decision is not relevant here."
640,4," Plaintiff argues in sur-reply that Areeda and Hovenkamp criticized the reasoning of Klamath, see Areeda & Hovenkamp ¶ 
1745g4, but plaintiff overreads this criticism, which was not directed at the court's approach to the issue of separate billing, 
specifically, but at the court's approach to the bundling of health insurance and medical goods more generally. That aspect of 
the decision is not relevant here. "
641,5," Even if the Court indulges plaintiff by assuming that the MOC component should be considered a CPD product like any other 
that was ""separately available on the market before the innovation"" of bundling it with initial certification, that does not, by itself, 
make it a separate product now. ""[J]ust about every new product"" is made up of components that were previously available 
separately. Areeda & Hovenkamp ¶ 1746a. The separate availability of the components only suggests a tie if buyers were 
already ""putting the items together to operate in the same manner as the defendant's bundle."" Id. That is not this case because, 
by redesigning its certification product to include an initial examination component and subsequent MOC component, ABR 
bundled initial certification and MOC to ""operate together in a previously unattempted fashion."" Id. While it may be true that 
physicians have always purchased CPD products, plaintiff himself alleges that CPD products serve a different purpose from 
certification and had nothing to do with it until the maintenance of certification component was added, so consumers were not 
purchasing the components to operate together as they do now. This makes the new bundle not a tie but a single, new product 
composed of separate, previously available components. While the bundle is no longer new, having existed in some form since 
2002, this rationale ""would seem to last as long as the basic requirement can be met that the bundle works better when bundled 
by the defendant than by intermediaries or end users."" Id. ¶ 1746d. As the Court has explained above, the certification bundle 
only works, to the extent it works at all, when bundled by ABR."
641,6," Additionally, Areeda and Hovenkamp warn that antitrust scrutiny of new bundles by courts, which ""lack the technical expertise 
to judge product design,"" would likely ""result in errors that would deter socially desirable innovations and variations in product 
design,"" so courts in such circumstances ""should find a single product."" Id. ¶ 1746b; see Info. Res., Inc. v. A.C. Nielsen Co., 615 
F. Supp. 125, 129-30 (N.D. Ill. 1984) (finding a single product where the alleged tie was the result of a ""new technique"" added to 
the defendant's existing data-gathering product in an ""attempt to improve"" it and reasoning that the product ""cannot be broken 
down into each miniscule type of analysis but rather must be looked at as an overall service""). "
646,*," This disposition is not an opinion of the full Court and, pursuant to I.O.P. 5.7, does not constitute binding precedent. "
647,1," A DMF contains information concerning, among other things, a drug's composition and the materials used to prepare it. 21 
C.F.R. § 314.420(a). The FDA does not substantively review the contents of a DMF when submitted, id., but performs a 
completeness review to ensure the DMF contains all relevant information. The FDA will substantively review a DMF only in 
connection with NDAs, ANDAs, and similar submissions. Id."
647,2," An API supplier is not required to have a DMF to provide API. In addition, DMF development and drug manufacturing can occur 
simultaneously. A DMF need not be finalized until the drug application is filed."
647,3," The parties dispute whether Par entered into exclusivity agreements with PolyPeptide and Bachem, but for the purposes of this 
appeal of a summary judgment ruling, we will view the fact in Fresenius Kabi's favor."
647,4, Hemmo provided API for Eagle and Bachem provided API for Sandoz and permitted Sandoz to reference its DMF in the ANDA. 
648,5," Fresenius Kabi forfeited its tortious interference claim because it only mentioned the claim in the procedural history, in the 
""ruling presented for review"" section, and in a point heading of its opening brief, and it provided no arguments in support of the 
claim. See FTC v. AbbVie Inc., 976 F.3d 327, 368 n.3 (3d Cir. 2020) (HN1[
] ""[A]rguments raised in passing . . . but not 
squarely argued[] are forfeited on appeal."" (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting John Wyeth & Bro. Ltd. v. CIGNA Int'l.

648,7," This test governs both federal and state law antitrust claims. See Eisai, 821 F.3d at 402 & n.11. "
649,8," The District Court rejected two expert reports for the same reasons. For example, the Court rejected Dr. Ralph Tarantino's 
report because he did not review a draft ANDA or other elements that would have been in the proposed ANDA. Fresenius Kabi 
USA, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 32034, 2020 WL 901967, at *5. The Court also rejected Dr. John Thomas's report because he 
opined on the likely success in a patent action that had never been filed and was purely hypothetical. 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
32034, [WL] at *6. While there may be other grounds to reject their opinions, the absence of a filed ANDA or an actual lawsuit 
challenging the patents does not provide a basis under Wellbutrin to decline considering patent challenges in the context of this 
antitrust [**9]  case. See Wellbutrin, 868 F.3d at 167."
649,9," While the absence of a filed ANDA alone does not absolve a district court from engaging in this analysis, ambiguities in what 
the proposed ANDA would have contained, or other deficiencies in the record, may."
649,10," This scenario stands in contrast to City of Pittsburgh v. West Penn. Power Company, where the resolution of the underlying 
dispute was subject to the prerogative of an independent state administrative agency with broad supervisory power. 147 F.3d 
256, 259-60, 267-68 (3d Cir. 1998)."
649,11," The Northern District of Georgia's decision in In re AndroGel Antitrust Litig. (No. II), No. 1:09-CV-955, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
99716, 2018 WL 2984873 (N.D. Ga. June 14, 2018), should not influence this analysis. That case is irreconcilable with 
Wellbutrin. See AndroGel, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 99716, 2018 WL 2984873, at *14 (stating that experts who testify as to the 
likely outcome of underlying patent litigation, ""like the expert relied upon in Wellbutrin, are coming up with probabilities out of 
whole cloth"" (footnote omitted))."
649,12," On remand, the District Court may choose to consider whether the exclusivity agreement even constitutes anticompetitive 
conduct because if it does not, then no patent analysis is needed. HN6[
] An exclusivity agreement is unlawful under the rule of 
reason ""only if the probable effect of the arrangement is to substantially lessen competition, rather than merely disadvantage 
rivals."" Eisai, 821 F.3d at 403 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting ZF Meritor, LLC v. Eaton Corp., 696 F.3d 254, 271 (3d 
Cir. 2012)). To evaluate the legality of such agreements, courts consider ""whether a plaintiff has shown substantial foreclosure of 
the market for the relevant product,"" and ""the likely or actual [**10]  anticompetitive effects of the exclusive dealing arrangement, 
including whether there was reduced output, increased price, or reduced quality in goods or services."" Id. Whether the defendant 
qualifies as a monopolist will also bear on this analysis. Id. at 404. Various facts shed light on the issue of substantial foreclosure. For example, the record shows that exclusivity arrangements are 
""fairly normal with generics,"" App. 1065, and, in fact, Fresenius Kabi has entered into such arrangements. The record also 
shows that Fresenius Kabi was offered the chance to compete for an exclusive arrangement with BCN for its API via a "
650,," competitive monetary offer but declined to pursue it. Race Tires, 614 F.3d at 79, 84 (holding, under the facts of that case, that ""to 
offer more money"" is not coercive). The record also reveals that there were other API suppliers who were willing to provide API 
to Fresenius, although they either had not yet begun or were in the early stages of producing vasopressin API. In addition, other 
manufactures worked with suppliers other than BCN, and those manufacturers eventually filed ANDAs. The District Court may 
consider whether these API suppliers were viable during the relevant period, see Geneva Pharms. Tech. Corp. v. Barr Lab'ys, 
Inc., 386 F.3d 485, 489-91, 502, 509 (2d Cir. 2004) (vacating grant [**11]  of summary judgment for the defendant drug 
manufacturers because there were disputed facts concerning whether viable alternate sources of API were available ""to generic 
[drug] manufacturers during the period at issue""), or whether Par ""foreclose[d] so large a percentage of the available supply"" as 
to present a threat to competition, not just disadvantage to a rival, ZF Meritor, LLC, 696 F.3d at 271, 284 (quoting Race Tires, 
614 F.3d at 76). In conducting this analysis, the absence or presence of a DMF is not in itself dispositive. A manufacturer need 
not partner with a supplier with an active DMF during its development of an ANDA, and sometimes a drug applicant may choose 
to not reference a DMF in its ANDA filing at all. Fresenius Kabi itself has worked with API suppliers without an active DMF when 
developing other drugs, and since 2008 has filed six NDAs or ANDAs that did not reference a DMF. If the District Court chooses 
to consider whether Par engaged in anticompetitive conduct, it is for that Court to decide whether there are disputes of material 
fact concerning these points and others that may be relevant to determining whether Par's arrangement with BCN ""bar[red] a 
substantial number of rivals or severely restrict[ed] the market's ambit."" [**12]  Eisai, 821 F.3d at 403 (quoting United States v. 
Dentsply Int'l, Inc., 399 F.3d 181, 191 (3d Cir. 2005)). "

50% off + 10% off"" on its website. (Dkt. No. 1, Compl. ¶ 10.) This complaint is not relevant to and does not support Plaintiff's 
false advertisement claim of 50% off PLUS 12 months interest-free promotions. "
659,4," Section 17508 provides that ""(a) It shall be unlawful for any person doing business in California and advertising to consumers in 
California to make any false or misleading advertising claim, including claims that (1) purport to be based on factual, objective, or 
clinical evidence, (2) compare the product's effectiveness or safety to that of other brands or products, or (3) purport to be based 
on any fact."" Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 17508. Plaintiff fails to provide any factual allegations to support a violation of Section 
17508. "
661,5," At this stage, because the Court has granted dismissal of the complaint, the Court declines to address Defendant's argument 
concerning the remedies Plaintiff seeks. (Dkt. No. 15-1 at 17, 19.) "
665,1," The parties are well aware of the facts. A more detailed review of the facts exists in the analysis section discussing Switch's 
behavior toward specific Cobalt customers. "
667,2, The Court will consider bifurcating the trial to assess damages after the issue of liability has been decided. 
671,3," The Rebel Alliance is a reference to the science fiction movie Star Wars. In Star Wars, the Rebel Alliance, i.e. the good guys, is 
a small group of dissenters who are determined to bring down the evil Empire. Switch appears to see itself as the Rebel 
Alliance; a small group of loveable heroes, while it sees Cobalt as the Empire; an evil group determined to destroy all who defy 
them."
671,4," Cobalt states it ""had a partnership agreement"" with the company while Switch cites deposition testimony stating it was 
""probably true"" that there was an unwritten agreement between SilverBack and Cobalt. However, the terms of the agreement 
have not been identified and no agreement has been produced. "
673,5," See e.g., Harfouche v. Wehbe, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 36057, 2014 WL 12789831, *2 (D. Nev. Mar. 18, 2014) (holding claims 
for both intentional interference of contractual relations and prospective economic advantage are subject to a three-year statute 
of limitations); Forman v. United Health Products, Inc., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 48045, 2020 WL 1308326, *4 (D. Nev. Mar. 19, 
2020) (same). But see Nickler v. Clark Cty., 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 63951, *9 (D. Nev. April 15, 2019) (finding intentional 
interference of prospective economic advantage claims are subject to a four-year statute of limitations). "
674,6," The Court has already granted summary judgment on this claim to Switch. A full statute of limitations analysis on the intentional 
interference with prospective economic advantage claim is not included. "
677,1," Phishing is defined as ""a scam by which an Internet user is duped (as by a deceptive e-mail message) into revealing personal 
or confidential information which the scammer can use illicitly."" Phishing, Merriam-Webster.com, https://www.merriam-
webster.com/dictionary/phishing (last accessed December 28, 2020). "
683,2," Plaintiff offers James Van Dyke as an expert in data security. See d/e 52-1, p. 31. Mr. Van Dyke is the founder of a ""research 
consulting firm specializing in areas including identity fraud and security."" Id. "
684,3," Mr. Van Dyke objects to the publication of the exact figures in his opinions, claiming that the figures are confidential. At this 
time, the Court does not make a ruling on this issue and will protect the data in this Opinion. "
707,1," See N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 356:14 (""In any action or prosecution under this chapter, the courts may be guided by 
interpretations of the United States' antitrust laws.""). "
710,2," Plaintiffs' argument that Bennett overlooks Freeman is not convincing in light of the fact that Bennett cites to Freeman's 
""substantial effects"" test in full. See id. at 756. "
711,3," Plaintiffs rely on In re Solodyn (Minocycline Hydrochloride) Antitrust Litig., No. 14-md-2503 (DJC), 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
125999, 2015 WL 5458570, at *16 (D. Mass. Sept. 16, 2015), for the proposition that they have satisfied the ""intrastate"" pleading 
standard. That argument is unavailing, because In re Solodyn concerned the state's antitrust law, not its consumer protection 
law and the attendant requirement that the alleged harm be primarily intrastate. "
714,1," The facts are drawn from the allegations in Plaintiffs' Complaint [#1], which must be taken as true when considering the Motion. 
See Wilson v. Montano, 715 F.3d 847, 850 n.1 (10th Cir. 2013) (citing Brown v. Montoya, 662 F.3d 1152, 1162 (10th Cir. 2011))."
714,2," The Complaint has two sets of Paragraphs 1-4. In this instance, the Court cites to the second Paragraph 2."
714,3," In this instance, the Court cites to the first Paragraph 2."
714,4," In this instance, the Court cites to the second Paragraph 4."
714,5," Although the Complaint states that the Agreement was attached as an exhibit, no exhibits were submitted to the Court. [See #1 
at ¶16] "
716,6," The Complaint asserts a total of ten claims for relief; however, in their Response, Plaintiffs concede that Claim Nine, for 
promissory estoppel, is not asserted against IDT. [#28 at 2, n. 1]"
716,7," For example, the recitation of the first claim for relief states: (1) ""Mr. Abdi and IIT entered into a valid and enforceable 
Agreement with CDI"" [#1 at ¶ 74]; (2) Mr. Dieter and CDI materially breached the Agreement . . ."" [id. at ¶ 76]; (3) ""Mr. Dieter 
directed CDI's purposeful conduct and breaches . . ."" [id. at ¶ 77]; (4) Mr. Dieter and CDI's conduct constitutes a willful and 
wanton breach of the Agreement"" [id. at ¶ 78]; and (5) ""[a]s a direct and proximate result of Mr. Dieter's and CDI's willful and 
wanton breach of the Agreement . . ."" [id. at ¶ 79]. Notably, the first claim does not claim either that IDT entered into a contract 
with Plaintiffs or that it breached said contract. [Id. at ¶¶ 73-79]"
716,8," The Complaint states: ""Although IDT developed the Service, it needed help to distribute the Service to generate revenue. IDT 
contracted with CDI to distribute the Service, which allowed CDI to enter into contracts with other distributors to distribute the "
717,," Service."" [#1 at ¶ 10] But this does not allege that IDT gave CDI permission to contract on its behalf; it alleges only that CDI's 
contract with IDT permitted CDI to take additional actions in order to distribute the Service."
717,9," Plaintiffs cited Nat'l Rural Telcoms. Coop. v. DIRECTB, INC., 319 F. Supp. 2d 1059, 1068-69 (9th Cir. 2003), which was 
dealing with the tort of intentional interference with business relations, and Total Rx Care, LLC v. Great N. Ins. Co., No. 3:16-CV-
2965-B, 2017 WL 3034083, at *6-7 (N.D. Tex. July 17, 2017), which was considering a fraudulent inducement claim. [#28 at 5-6]"
717,10," For example, the cases cited by Plaintiffs find that ""as merely a third-party beneficiary, [Defendant] cannot be sued on the 
[contract] at issue,"" Am. Credit Indem. Co. v. HCG Fin. Servs. Inc., No. 89 C 9583, 1991 WL 119129, at *2 (N.D. Ill. June 24, 
1991), and ""[t]his [c]ourt has surveyed federal cases from around the country and has not found a case suggesting that third-
party beneficiaries may be sued for breach of a contract to which they are not parties,"" Peter v. Alamo Holdings, S.A., No. 12-
60544-CIV-ROSENBAUM/SELTZER, 2012 WL 13135289, at *4 (S.D. Fl. Dec. 3, 2012) (collecting cases)."
717,11," ""Although an accounting is an extraordinary remedy, it may be ordered if the plaintiff is unable to determine how much, if any, 
money is due him or her from another."" Patterson v. BP Am. Prod. Co., 159 P.3d 634, 642 (Colo. App. 2006), overruled on other 
grounds by 185 P.3d 811 (Colo. 2008) (citing Andrikopoulos v. Broadmoor Mgmt. Co., 670 P.2d 435 (Colo. App. 1983)). ""Under 
Colorado law, a demand for an accounting and a refusal to comply with the demand must be pleaded and proved."" Postal 
Instant Press v. Jackson, 658 F. Supp. 739, 743 (D. Colo. 1987) (citing Am. Woodmen's Life Ins. Co. v. Supreme Camp of Am. 
Woodmen, 549 P.2d 423, 425 (Colo. App. 1976)). However, exceptions to the pre-suit demand requirement apply where 
preclusion of the accounting claim would be unreasonable, such as where the accounting claim is ancillary to a breach of 
contract claim and its main purpose is to facilitate an accurate calculation of damages once the breach of contract is found. See 
Kirzhner v. Silverstein, 09-CV-02858-CMA, 2010 WL 2985615, at *12 (D. Colo. July 23, 2010); Patterson, 159 P.3d 634 at 642. 
Here, Plaintiffs' accounting claim centers on its assertion that the Agreement requires CDI and IDT to provide records regarding 
commissions due under the Agreement. [#1 at ¶ 125] Plaintiffs have not sufficiently alleged that IDT was a party to the 
Agreement, nor have they alleged that they demanded an accounting from IDT. [See #1 at ¶¶ 55, 126 n. 11] "
718,12," IDT's Motion devotes only two paragraphs to this claim and does not address the first prong of a tortious interference claim, 
arguing only that Plaintiffs have failed to allege intentional and improper interference. [#11 at 6-7] While as detailed below the 
Court agrees that Plaintiffs have failed to adequately allege intentional and improper interference, as explained herein, the Court 
also believes that Plaintiffs have failed to adequately allege the existence of a contract or prospective contract. And while IDT's 
Motion lacks depth in its analysis of the tortious interference claim, Plaintiffs' response is even worse. Plaintiffs' entire analysis of 
the tortious interference claim can be found in a one sentence footnote, stating: ""The foregoing [analysis of Plaintiffs' breach of 
contract claim] also demonstrates why Plaintiffs has (sic) properly pled their claim for tortious interference with a contract."" [#28 
at 9 n.2] The response is devoid of any analysis of the elements of a tortious interference claim, nor does it attempt to explain 
how IDT's actions constituted improper interference."
718,13," To be clear, the Complaint alleges in detail the Agreement that Plaintiffs had with CDI. But Plaintiffs' tortious interference claim 
is premised upon IDT's purported interference with the contractual relationships IIT had with its customers, not with any 
contractual relationship Plaintiffs had with CDI. [#1 at ¶¶ 81-86] "
719,14," To the degree that Plaintiffs assert that these actions were improper because they were precluded by the Agreement, the 
Court reiterates that Plaintiffs have not sufficiently alleged that any agreement existed between Plaintiffs and IDT. "
720,15," For example, the Complaint alleges: (1) ""Mr. Dieter directed CDI to conspire with IDT,"" [#1 at ¶ 94]; (2) ""Defendants' 
agreements in violation of"" the antitrust acts [id. at ¶ 95]; (3) ""CDI and IDT decided they no longer needed Mr. Abdi or IIT"" [id. at 
¶ 42]; and (4) ""CDI and IDT conspired and agreed to cut Mr. Abdi and IIT out of the market, with an ultimate goal of stealing IIT's 
Distributor's Network and terminating IIT's Agreement"" [id. at ¶ 43]. "
721,16," A successful claim of civil theft entitles a plaintiff to triple damages, attorney fees and costs. Colo. Rev. Stat. § 18-4-405."
721,17," Paragraphs 50 and 60 refer to actions taken by CDI's legal counsel and do not reference IDT. [#1 at ¶¶ 50, 60] Paragraph 53 
states: ""On January 11, 2016, CDI advised IIT about an INACTIVE Retailer Campaign to reduce INACTIVE retailer accounts and 
increase revenue."" [Id. at ¶53 (quotations omitted)]. "
722,18," This claim and the claim regarding the promotional codes again rest on Plaintiffs' assertion that IDT owed Plaintiffs 
commissions and codes under a contract. "
723,19," Within fourteen days after service of a copy of this Recommendation, any party may serve and file written objections to the 
magistrate judge's proposed findings of fact, legal conclusions, and recommendations with the Clerk of the United States District 
Court for the District of Colorado. 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1); Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b); Griego v. Padilla (In re Griego), 64 F.3d 580, 583 
(10th Cir. 1995). A general objection that does not put the district court on notice of the basis for the objection will not preserve 
the objection for de novo review. ""[A] party's objections to the magistrate judge's report and recommendation must be both timely 
and specific to preserve an issue for de novo review by the district court or for appellate review."" United States v. 2121 East 30th 
Street, 73 F.3d 1057, 1060 (10th Cir. 1996). Failure to make timely objections may bar de novo review by the district judge of the 
magistrate judge's proposed findings of fact, legal conclusions, and recommendations and will result in a waiver of the right to 
appeal from a judgment of the district court based on the proposed findings of fact, legal conclusions, and recommendations of 
the magistrate [*30]  judge. See Vega v. Suthers, 195 F.3d 573, 579-80 (10th Cir. 1999) (holding that the district court's decision 
to review magistrate judge's recommendation de novo despite lack of an objection does not preclude application of ""firm waiver 
rule""); Int'l Surplus Lines Ins. Co. v. Wyo. Coal Refining Sys., Inc., 52 F.3d 901, 904 (10th Cir. 1995) (finding that cross-claimant 
waived right to appeal certain portions of magistrate judge's order by failing to object to those portions); Ayala v. United States, 
980 F.2d 1342, 1352 (10th Cir. 1992) (finding that plaintiffs waived their right to appeal the magistrate judge's ruling by failing to 
file objections). But see, Morales-Fernandez v. INS, 418 F.3d 1116, 1122 (10th Cir. 2005) (holding that firm waiver rule does not 
apply when the interests of justice require review). "
728,**," This summary constitutes no part of the opinion of the court. It has been prepared by court staff for the convenience of the 
reader."
728,*," The Honorable Eugene E. Siler, United States Circuit Judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, sitting by 
designation. "
729,1, The FTC filed an administrative complaint challenging the Vievu acquisition later that same day. 
731,2," Because the Court viewed these factors as originating from Thunder Basin, courts have sometimes called them the Thunder 
Basin factors. "
732,3," These three claims do not line up with the three claims that Axon brought in its complaint. Rather, Axon agreed that the FTC 
should decide the merits of the antitrust dispute and that the clearance process claim falls within its due process claim. "
733,4," Axon seeks to distinguish Standard Oil on the basis that it did not deal with an allegedly unconstitutional proceeding. Other 
circuits have rejected this distinction, however. See Jarkesy, 803 F.3d at 26 (""If the injury inflicted on the party seeking review is 
the burden of going through an agency proceeding . . . then [Standard Oil] teaches that the party must patiently await the 
denouement of proceedings within the Article II Branch."" (internal quotation marks omitted)); Bennett, 844 F.3d at 185 (rejecting 
the argument that ""Standard Oil is inapposite because it did not involve a constitutional claim"" because it ""makes no material 
difference for assessing the meaningfulness of judicial review here, because Thunder Basin and Elgin establish that petitioners 
can obtain meaningful review of constitutional claims through a statutory scheme similar to the one here"")."
733,5," It is telling that Axon appears disappointed that ""the best Axon can hope for is a remand for a complete do-over."" A ""do-over,"" 
however, is exactly the type of relief the Supreme Court has ordered when it has found a constitutional violation of an agency "
734,," process. See Lucia v. SEC, 138 S. Ct. 2044, 2055, 201 L. Ed. 2d 464 (2018) (after finding an Appointments Clause violation, 
concluding that ""the 'appropriate' remedy for an adjudication tainted with an appointments violation is a new 'hearing before a 
properly appointed' official""); see also Free Enterprise, 561 U.S. at 508-513 (rejecting the argument that the Appointments 
Clause violation rendered all of the Board's actions and authority in violation of the Constitution and instead severing the 
unconstitutional tenure provisions from the statute and concluding that ""petitioners are not entitled to broad injunctive relief 
against the Board's continued operations""). "
735,6," Axon's reliance on Fashion Originators Guild of America v. FTC, 114 F.2d 80, 31 F.T.C. 1837 (2nd Cir. 1940) is inapt. That 
case dealt with a situation in which the petitioner asked the court to review whether it was proper for FTC to actively exclude 
evidence that it deemed irrelevant. See id. at 82-83. That does not affect whether a court can remand for further factfinding as it 
pertains to Axon's constitutional claims."
735,7," The dissent cites Mace v. Skinner, 34 F.3d 854 (9th Cir. 1994), and Latif v. Holder, 686 F.3d 1122 (9th Cir. 2012), but neither 
mandates district court jurisdiction here. Mace did not cite or apply Thunder Basin. And Latif did not consider the Thunder Basin 
factors under the second step of the implied preclusion analysis because the court ruled under the first step that Congress' intent 
to preclude jurisdiction was not ""fairly discernable from the statutory scheme"" at issue. 686 F.3d at 1129."
735,8," The dissent notes that Axon may not have an opportunity to have a court review the structure of the FTC if the FTC drops its 
investigation or Axon prevails on the merits during the administrative proceeding. But under either scenario, Axon has prevailed 
over FTC, and that ends the dispute. Put another way, Axon is not entitled to a judicial ruling on its constitutional claim 
challenging the administrative proceeding if it has prevailed on the merits. "
736,9," Though Axon repeatedly points to cases involving a court asserting jurisdiction over pattern and practice claims, those cases 
are inapt. None of those cases even mention the possibility that Congress can impliedly preclude district court jurisdiction, so 
they are not relevant. See generally McNary v. Haitian Refugee Ctr., Inc., 498 U.S. 479, 111 S. Ct. 888, 112 L. Ed. 2d 1005 
(1991); Gebhardt v. Nielsen, 879 F.3d 980 (9th Cir. 2018); Veterans for Common Sense v. Shinseki, 678 F.3d 1013 (9th Cir. 
2012). Moreover, many of these cases fit within the implied preclusion framework because they consider whether the parties 
could have obtained meaningful review or whether the claims at issue were collateral to the review scheme. See McNary, 498 
U.S. at 496 (finding jurisdiction in part because, ""if not allowed to pursue their claims in the District Court, respondents would not 
as a practical matter be able to obtain meaningful judicial review of their application denials or of their objections to INS 
procedures notwithstanding the review provisions""); VCS, 678 F.3d at 1034-35 (relying on the fact that the claim at issue could 
not have been raised under the statutory scheme); City of Rialto v. W. Coast Loading Corp., 581 F.3d 865, 874 (9th Cir. 2009) 
(asking ""whether the claim . . . is collateral to an alien's substantive eligibility"" and ""stress[ing] the importance of meaningful 
judicial review of agency action."")."
736,10," The Fifth, Seventh, and Eleventh Circuits have not definitively addressed this issue. See Bank of Louisiana, 919 F.3d at 928; 
Hill, 825 F.3d at 1251-52; Bebo, 799 F.3d at 773-74. "
739,11," Had Axon brought its clearance process claim early in the investigation, before the enforcement proceeding began, though, 
Axon might have had a stronger case for district court jurisdiction, but that issue is not properly before us. "
741,1," The majority wrongly discards these precedents. First, I disagree that Mace is not controlling in light of Thunder [**40]  Basin. 
Maj. Op. at 19 n.7. The majority posits no irreconcilability between the cases and so Mace remains binding law. See Miller v. 
Gammie, 335 F.3d 889, 893 (9th Cir. 2003) (holding that precedent of this court remains binding unless it is ""clearly 
irreconcilable"" with intervening Court decisions). Second, while it is contestable whether Latif was a Thunder Basin step one or 
two case, I fail to see why its guidance should be ignored here. "
742,2," I limit my analysis to the second step of the Thunder Basin inquiry since Axon acknowledges that the FTC Act provides for 
exclusive agency jurisdiction over some claims."
742,3," The majority concludes that if Axon prevails on the antitrust merits, ""that ends the dispute."" Maj. Op. 20 n.8. I respectfully 
disagree. Winning on the antitrust merits does nothing to remedy Axon's independent injury of being subject to an 
unconstitutional structure or procedure. In Free Enterprise Fund, the agency's investigation of the plaintiff ""produced no 
sanction;"" nevertheless, the Court held that the firm was permitted to bring its constitutional challenge against the PCAOB in 
district court. 561 U.S. at 490. That is because ""a separation-of-powers violation may create a 'here-and-now' injury"" that is 
independent on the agency's merits determinations. Id. at 513; see also Seila Law, 140 S. Ct. at 2196 (recognizing the 
longstanding ability of ""private parties aggrieved by an official's exercise of executive power to challenge the official's authority to 
wield that power""). "
743,4," The majority recognizes that Free Enterprise Fund requires a ""guaranteed"" right of appeal to receive meaningful review. Maj. 
Op. 20. But the majority doesn't explain how Axon obtains such review if the FTC chooses not to place Axon in administrative 
proceedings or issue a cease-and-desist order as is required for judicial review under the FTC Act. In such cases, the majority 
must concede no judicial review is possible. I believe this violates the holding of Free Enterprise Fund."
743,5," The majority suggests that Axon did not act quick enough. The majority contends, if Axon filed its claims ""early in the 
investigation,"" then it might have had a stronger case for district court jurisdiction. Maj. Op. 29 n.11. Such a malleable test for 
district court jurisdiction is seemingly unworkable. See Elgin, 567 U.S. at 15 (rejecting jurisdictional rules that rely on ""amorphous 
distinctions"" and ""hazy"" lines). After all, how ""early"" is early enough? Is the day before the FTC files its enforcement action 
enough? Two weeks before? This ""early enough"" test ignores Court precedent which focuses not on the timing of the claim, but 
on the nature of the claim. See, e.g., Thunder Basin, 510 U.S. at 207 (looking to the three-factor test despite the claim being 
""pre-enforcement""). More fundamentally, nothing in the FTC Act suggests that Congress intended such an ""early-in-the-
investigation"" test. "
744,6," The majority contends that it is following ""every other circuit that has addressed a similar issue"" in finding no district court 
jurisdiction over any of Axon's claims. Maj. Op. 5. First, if so, those other decisions conflict with our court's precedent. See Mace, 
34 F.3d at 858-60; Americopters, 441 F.3d at 735-36; Latif, 686 F.3d at 1128-29. Second, I am not so sure that every other 
circuit agrees with the majority. The Fifth Circuit has recently granted rehearing en banc in a directly analogous case and, thus, 
has vacated a panel decision following the majority's reasoning. See Cochran v. SEC, 978 F.3d 975 (5th Cir. Oct. 30, 2020). 
Finally, I find the dissents in several of those cases to be more persuasive. See Cochran v. SEC, 969 F.3d 507, 519 (5th Cir. 
2020) (Haynes, J., dissenting) (distinguishing Elgin and Thunder Basin because the parties there challenged ""the 
constitutionality of a substantive statute that gave rise to an administrative action"" rather than ""the constitutional grounding of the 
agency overseeing the proceedings.""); Tilton v. SEC, 824 F.3d 276, 298 (2d Cir. 2016) (Droney, J., dissenting) (""Forcing the 
appellants to await a final Commission order before they may assert their constitutional claim in a federal court means that by 
the time the day for judicial review comes, they will already have suffered the injury that they are attempting to prevent.""). "

Pamela S. Ward, and Christine O. Whalen. See First Amended Complaint ¶ 9."
753,2," The Plaintiffs' initial complaint was filed against AMR, American Airlines, Inc., US Airways, and US Airways, Inc. that have since 
merged into the single entity, AAG. See Complaint for Injunctive Relief Against Violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Antitrust Act 
[Adv. Proc. ECF No. 1]. For purposes of consistency with the Court's prior rulings, the Court shall continue to refer to AAG as the 
""Defendants"" rather than the ""Defendant."""
753,3," The preamble to the First Amended Complaint indicates that the Plaintiffs also filed this action to ""prevent a threatened violation 
of Section 2(c) of the [Robinson-Patman Act], 15 U.S.C. § 13(c),"" which prohibits false commissions or brokerage fees as a 
disguised form of price discrimination. First Amended Complaint at 2. As the Court previously granted the Defendants' motion for 
summary judgment with respect to the Plaintiffs' Section 2(c) claim, this claim is not the subject of this decision. See Aug. 29, 
2018 Hr'g Tr. at 79:17-25 [Adv. Proc. ECF No. 177]; Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Defendants' Motion for 
Summary Judgment and Denying Plaintiffs' Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment [Adv. Proc. ECF No. 176]."
753,4," Defendants sought to seal certain witness statements and later, certain portions of the witness statement of Janusz A. Ordover 
concerning data with respect to fares, ticketing data, pricing information and pricing trends. See Notice of Defendant American 
Airlines Group Inc.'s Motion for Entry of Order Pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 107(b) and Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9018 Authorizing the Filing 
of Certain Information Provisionally Under Seal in Connection with Defendant American Airlines Group Inc.'s Witness 
Statements [Adv. Proc. ECF No. 246]; Defendant American Airlines Group Inc.'s Motion for Entry of Order Pursuant to 11 U.S.C. 
§ 107(b) and Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9018 Authorizing the Filing of Certain Information Under Seal in Connection with the Witness 
Statement of Janusz A. Ordover [Adv. Proc. ECF No. 261]. In response to the Defendants' requests, the Court entered an order 
sealing portions of Janusz A. Ordover's witness statement. See Order Pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 107(b) and Fed. R. Bankr. P. 
9018 Authorizing the Filing of Certain Information Under Seal in Connection with the Witness Statement of Janusz A. Ordover 
[Adv. Proc. ECF No. 266] (the ""Ordover Sealing Order""). Nothing in this decision implicates the information set forth in the 
Ordover Sealing Order. Coupled with the conduct of trial and the public filing of the trial transcripts, the Court concludes that 
there is nothing in this decision that requires sealing. See Order Designating Official Real-Time Trial Transcripts [Adv. Proc. ECF 
No. 282]. "
754,5," Both the Plaintiffs and the Defendants agreed that the Court has jurisdiction over these matters, that this proceeding is a ""core 
proceeding"" under 28 U.S.C. § 157(b)(2), and that venue is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1408 and 1409. See Initial 
Complaint ¶¶ 6-8; Defendant US Airways' Answer to Complaint for Injunctive Relief Against Violation of Section 7 of the Clayton 
Antitrust Act ¶¶ 6-8 [Adv. Proc. ECF No. 32]; Answer of Defendants AMR Corporation and American Airlines to Complaint for 
Injunctive Relief Against Violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Antitrust Act ¶¶ 6-8 [Adv. Proc. ECF No. 40]; see also First 
Amended Complaint ¶¶ 6-8 (stating the same). "
755,6," The Horizontal Merger Guidelines do not use the phrase ""presumptively illegal."" Rather, they state that post-merger HHI 
concentration levels in excess of 2,500 generally result in a market classification of ""highly concentrated"" and post-merger 
increases in HHI levels in excess of 200 are ""presumed to . . . likely . . . enhance market power."" Horizontal Merger Guidelines § 
5.3. "
757,7," The Court's inquiry was driven in part to address any concerns regarding this Court's jurisdiction in light of Stern v. Marshall, 
564 U.S. 462, 131 S. Ct. 2594, 180 L. Ed. 2d 475 (2011)."
757,8," The U.S. Department of Transportation's Origin and Destination Survey Data, more commonly referred to as DB1B, is a ""public 
database published by the U.S. Department of Transportation, Bureau of Transportation Statistics"" that served as the ""data 
source for all . . . experts in this case."" Declaration of Dr. Carl Lundgren in Support of Plaintiffs' Cross-Motion for Summary 
Judgment ¶ 16 [Adv. Proc. ECF No. 149-4] (the ""2017 Lundgren Declaration""). "
758,9," For purposes of this decision, the term ""fiscal year"" refers to the beginning of the fourth quarter of the prior year through the 
third quarter of the current year. Accordingly, the dataset for fiscal year 2016 encompasses the four quarters of data beginning 
with fourth quarter of 2015 through the third quarter of 2016 (i.e., October 1, 2015-September 30, 2016). See 2017 Lundgren 
Declaration ¶ 10. "
759,10," The Court also granted summary judgment to Defendants on Plaintiffs' claim under Section 2(c) of the Robinson-Patman Act, 
15 U.S.C. § 13(c). See Summary Judgment Decision at 79:17-25; Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Defendants' 
Motion for Summary Judgment and Denying Plaintiffs' Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment [Adv. Proc. ECF No. 176]. "
760,11," Following the Court's rulings on the Lundgren Supplemental Report, the Plaintiffs filed a fifth motion to amend, seeking for a 
fifth time to add a claim for treble damages under Section 4 of the Clayton Antitrust Act, 15 U.S.C. § 15(a) and a demand for a 
jury trial, which was denied. See Fjord v. AMR Corp. (In re AMR Corp.), 597 B.R. 486, 491-94 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 2019) (""Fjord 
IV"") (denying motion to amend on grounds that it was untimely, the relief sought would be prejudicial to the Defendants, and that 
the Plaintiffs had acted with undue delay)."
760,12," For purposes of this decision, the Court shall hereinafter refer to each respective witness' written direct examination as 
""[Witness] Dir. Ex."" The Plaintiffs filed written direct examinations for each of the following witnesses: Dr. Carl Lundgren, Jose Brito, Don Fry, Gabe 
Garavarian, Valarie Jolly, Lisa McCarthy, Bill Rubinsohn, Sondra Russell, June Stansbury, and Gary Talewsky. See Joint 
Pretrial Order at Ex. 3 [Adv. Proc. ECF No. 214-3]; Written Direct Examination of Dr. Carl Lundgren [Adv. Proc. ECF No. 236] 
(the ""Lundgren Dir. Ex.""); Written Direct Examination of Jose Brito [Adv. Proc. ECF No. 237] (the ""Brito Dir. Ex.""); Written Direct 
Examination of Don Fry [Adv. Proc. ECF No. 238] (the ""Fry Dir. Ex.""); Written Direct Examination of Gabe Garavarian [Adv. 
Proc. ECF No. 239] (the ""Garavanian Dir. Ex.""); Written Direct Examination of Valerie Jolly [Adv. Proc. ECF No. 240] (the ""Jolly 
Dir. Ex.""); Written Direct Examination of Lisa McCarthy [Adv. Proc. ECF No. 241] (the ""McCarthy Dir. Ex.""); Written Direct 
Examination of Bill Rubinsohn [Adv. Proc ECF No. 242] (the ""Rubinsohn Dir. Ex.""); Written Direct Examination of Sondra Russell 
[Adv. Proc. ECF No. 243] (the ""Russell Dir. Ex.""); Written Direct Examination of June Stansbury [Adv. Proc. ECF No. 244] (the 
""Stansbury Dir. Ex.""); Written Direct Examination of Gary Talewsky [Adv. Proc. ECF No. 245] (the ""Talewsky Dir. Ex.""). The Defendants filed written direct examinations for each of the following witnesses provisionally under seal: Heather Garboden, 
William Douglas Parker, Dennis W. Carlton, Daniel M. Kasper, and Janusz A. Ordover. See Witness Statement of Heather 
Garboden [Adv. Proc. ECF No. 249-1] (the ""Garboden Dir. Ex.""); Witness Statement of William Douglas Parker [Adv. Proc. ECF 
No. 249-2] (the ""Parker Dir. Ex.""); Witness Statement of Dennis W. Carlton [Adv. Proc. ECF No. 249-3] (the ""Carlton Dir. Ex.""); 
Witness Statement of Daniel M. Kasper [Adv. Proc. ECF No. 249-4] (the ""Kasper Dir. Ex.""); Witness Statement of Janusz A. 
Ordover [Adv. Proc. ECF No. 249-5] (the ""Ordover Dir. Ex.""). At trial, the Defendants presented a corrected version of Daniel 
Kasper's written statement which the Court ultimately accepted into evidence. See Mar. 14, 2019 Trial Tr. at 973:21-975:10, 
980:4-14 [Adv. Proc. ECF No. 288]. Accordingly, for purposes of this decision, all references to ""Kasper Dir. Ex."" shall refer to 
the corrected version."
760,13," The Plaintiffs' witness list indicated that they intended to submit written direct testimony of non-testifying Plaintiffs, Brenda 
Davis, Carolyn Fjord, Don Freeland, Gail Kosach, and Deborah Pulfer, solely with respect to the matter of standing. See Joint "
761,," Pretrial Order at Ex. 3 [Adv. Proc. ECF No. 214-3]. Ultimately, Plaintiffs and Defendants submitted an additional statement of 
undisputed facts highlighting city-pairs flown by Plaintiffs Carolyn Fjord, Don Freeland and Gail Kosach. See Hr'g Tr. at 30:10-
32:24 (Mar. 6, 2019) [Adv. Proc. ECF No. 281] (noting that Plaintiffs and Defendants would submit a stipulation reflecting their 
agreement on the written direct testimony of non-testifying Plaintiffs as to standing); Plaintiffs Carolyn Fjord, et al.'s and 
Defendant American Airlines Group Inc.'s Stipulation of Undisputed Facts [Adv. Proc. ECF No. 260]."
761,14," Plaintiffs submitted the deposition testimony of several other witnesses: Thomas Horton, Andrew Nocella, Virasb Vahidi, 
Beverly Goulet, Scott Kirby and Donald Casey. See Joint Pretrial Order, Ex. 2. The Defendants submitted the depositions of Jerald Behrens, Derek DeCross, Thomas Horton, Scott Kirby, Michael Malaney, 
and Andrew Nocella. See Joint Pretrial Order at Ex. 4 [Adv. Proc. ECF No. 214-4]."
761,15," The Plaintiffs filed the following motions in limine: (1) Motion in Limine to Exclude Certain Evidence of Plaintiffs' Prior Litigation 
[Adv. Proc. ECF No. 223] (""Plaintiffs' Motion in Limine No. 1"") to exclude certain evidence relating to the Plaintiffs' prior litigation 
which the Plaintiffs asserted were unrelated, irrelevant, and prejudicial; (2) Plaintiffs' Motion in Limine No. 2 to Exclude 
Deposition Testimony Designated by Defendants in U.S. v. US Airways [Adv. Proc. ECF No. 226] (""Plaintiffs' Motion in Limine 
No. 2"") to exclude certain of the Defendants' designations of deposition testimony in United States v. U.S. Airways Grp., Inc., et 
al., 1:13-CV-1236 as inadmissible hearsay; (3) Plaintiffs' Motion in Limine No. 3 to Exclude Evidence of Efficiencies and/or to 
Exclude Evidence of Efficiencies Unrelated to Any City-Pair Relevant Market [Adv. Proc. ECF No. 227] (""Plaintiffs' Motion in 
Limine No. 3"") to exclude certain evidence of ""purported efficiencies"" as a result of the Merger as irrelevant; and (4) Plaintiffs' 
Motion in Limine No. 5 to Exclude Testimony of Heather Garboden [Adv. Proc. ECF No. 228] (""Plaintiffs' Motion in Limine No. 5"") 
to exclude the testimony of Heather Garboden on grounds that she was an ""undisclosed expert witness."" The Defendants filed the following motions in limine: (1) Notice of Motion and Motion in Limine to Exclude Evidence and 
Argument Regarding Plaintiffs' Other Litigations Against American Airlines [Adv. Proc. ECF No. 210] (""Defendants' Motion in 
Limine No. 1"") to exclude evidence and argument relating to the Plaintiffs' other litigations against AAG on grounds of irrelevancy 
(2) Notice of Motion and Motion in Limine to Exclude News Articles and Third-Party Report [Adv. Proc. ECF No. 211] 
(""Defendants' Motion in Limine No. 2"") to exclude news articles or third-party reports relating to air travel on grounds of 
inadmissibility. In support of the Defendants' motions in limine, the Defendants also filed the related Memorandum of Law in 
Support of American Airlines' Group Inc.'s Motions in Limine [Adv. Proc. ECF No. 212] and the Declaration of Sadik Huseny in 
Support of American Airlines Group Inc.'s Motions in Limine [Adv. Proc. ECF No. 213]."
761,16," With respect to Plaintiffs' Motion in Limine No. 1 and Defendants' Motion in Limine No. 1 concerning the exclusion of evidence 
relating to Plaintiffs' prior litigation and other litigation proceedings against American, respectively, the Court denies these 
motions as moot since neither party attempted to introduce such evidence at trial. See Defendant American Airlines Group Inc.'s 
Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law [Adv. Proc. ECF No. 272] (""Defendants' Proposed FOF/COL"") at 11 n.3 
(noting that parties did not introduce evidence of Plaintiffs' prior or other litigations against American). Similarly, with respect to 
Defendants' Motion in Limine No. 2, which sought the exclusion of news articles and third-party reports, the Court denies the 
motion as moot. Plaintiffs did not submit into evidence any of the specified news articles and third-party reports nor does the 
Court rely on any of the foregoing in reaching its decision. See Defendant American Airlines Group Inc.'s Memorandum of Law in 
Support of its Motions in Limine [Adv. Pro. ECF No. 212] (seeking the exclusion of exhibit numbers PX-050, PX-082, PX-087, 
PX-089, PX-092, PX-106, PX-112 and PX-115). The Court notes, however, that Plaintiffs submitted exhibit PX-02 into evidence 
during the examination of witness Douglas Parker, which is comprised of an email chain discussing a published news article 
regarding the merger between United and Continental airlines and their decision to keep Cleveland as a hub. See Hr'g Tr. at 
479:8-14, 481:14-482:20 (Mar. 12, 2019) (questioning Parker concerning his statements surrounding the article). As Defendants 
did not object to its admission at trial, that exhibit was admitted. Id. at 481:14-19. "
762,," Moreover, the Court denies Plaintiffs' Motion in Limine No. 2 concerning the exclusion of certain deposition testimony in the DOJ 
Proceeding as moot as the Court does not rely on such testimony to reach its ruling as discussed below. In a similar vein, the 
Court also denies Plaintiffs' Motion in Limine No. 3 which seeks to bar testimony from certain of Defendants' witnesses focusing 
on the purported efficiencies stemming from the Merger that are untethered to a specific city-pair market. The Court does not 
rely on Defendants' submitted evidence concerning efficiencies as the basis for a classic efficiencies defense, but rather 
considers the submitted evidence as factual context. See also infra Discussion, Section II.D.iii (addressing consideration of 
evidence of the Merger's efficiencies). "
764,17," ""Available Seat Miles,"" a metric commonly used in the airline industry, serves as the ""standard unit of measure for passenger 
carrying capacity"" and represents one seat flying one mile. Garboden Dir. Ex. ¶ 25; see also Carlton Dir. Ex. ¶ 21 (stating that 
ASMs are a ""standard measure of airline capacity""). "
766,18," The following discussion concerning the impact of the Merger on the airline industry is accurate with respect to the periods of 
time discussed at trial, all of which occurred prior to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Since the start of the pandemic, 
the global economy has faced substantial difficulties and the airline industry specifically has suffered a dramatic and sustained 
drop in air travel demand. See Alison Sider, Airlines Plan for Prolonged Coronavirus Drought, WALL ST. J., (Oct. 16, 2020), 
https://www.wsj.com/articles/airlines-plan-for-prolonged-coronavirus-travel-drought-11602848431 (discussing how passenger 
volume was more than 60% lower than what it was the year prior and that ""U.S. airlines expect that it will be years before their 
business recovers from the coronavirus pandemic""). The status of the airline industry in the COVID-19 era is not before this 
Court."
766,19," Econometric analysis is the application of statistical techniques and methodologies to economic data while controlling for 
additional factors. See Hr'g Tr. at 1261:21-1262:21 (Mar. 15, 2019) [Adv. Proc. ECF No. 280] (Dr. Carlton defining econometrics 
generally). "
767,20," ""Total Revenue Per Available Seat Mile"" is generally calculated by dividing the total operating revenue by ASMs and 
represents the amount of revenue per every seat-mile flown. See Garboden Dir. Ex. ¶ 40. "
769,21," But as discussed in greater detail below, the Court previously ruled that the Plaintiffs' testimony would only be considered as 
to alleged harms they incurred as domestic airline customers in the relevant city-pair markets, and not as alleged harms suffered 
by the public or by the Plaintiffs' travel agent customers.  [**56] See infra Discussion, Section II.A. "
772,22," Horizontal mergers are defined to be ""mergers and acquisitions involving actual or potential competitors"" whereas vertical 
mergers encompass non-horizontal transactions, including, in its strictest form, the combination of ""firms or assets at different 
stages of the same supply chain."" Horizontal Merger Guidelines § 1 (defining horizontal mergers); U.S. DEP'T OF JUSTICE AND FED. 
TRADE COMM'N, VERTICAL MERGER GUIDELINES § 1 (2020) (defining vertical mergers). Notably, despite its initial formulation within 
the horizontal merger context, the Baker Hughes' burden-shifting analysis has been applied to both horizontal and vertical 
mergers subject to differences in the type and nature of evidence a plaintiff must present to satisfy its initial burden. See, e.g., 
United States v. Anthem, Inc., 855 F.3d 345, 349, 428 U.S. App. D.C. 403 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (applying the Baker Hughes burden-
shifting analysis to a horizontal merger); United States v. AT&T, Inc., 916 F.3d 1029, 1032, 439 U.S. App. D.C. 388 (D.C. Cir. 
2019) (stating that, in applying Baker [**67]  Hughes to a proposed vertical merger, a plaintiff must make a ""fact-specific"" 
showing that a merger is ""likely to be anticompetitive"" as opposed to a mere offering of market concentration statistics to 
establish a prima facie case). "
773,23," The Court notes that, while not binding on courts, the Horizontal Merger Guidelines serve a significant role in the evaluation of 
proposed mergers. See Horizontal Merger Guidelines § 1 (noting that the Horizontal Merger Guidelines were prepared in part to 
""assist . . . courts in developing an appropriate framework for interpreting and applying . . . antitrust laws in the horizontal merger 
context""); Anthem, 855 F.3d at 349 (stating that the Horizontal Merger Guidelines remain a ""helpful tool"" for analyzing proposed 
mergers)."
773,24," HN4[
] The phrase ""incipiency doctrine"" refers the congressional policy to restrict mergers that may lead to a possible 
restriction of competition. See, e.g., Brown Shoe Co., Inc. v. United States, 370 U.S. 294, 346, 82 S. Ct. 1502, 8 L. Ed. 2d 510 
(1962) (stating that the court could not ""avoid the mandate of Congress that tendencies toward concentration in industry [were] 
to be curbed in their incipiency""); United States v. Von's Grocery Co., 384 U.S. 270, 277, 86 S. Ct. 1478, 16 L. Ed. 2d 555 (1966) 
(discussing the underlying congressional intent to enact Section 7 as a desire to ""preserve competition among many small 
businesses by arresting a trend toward competition in its incipiency before that trend developed to the point that a market was 
left in the grip of a few big companies""); E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 353 U.S. at 597 (defining ""incipiency"" within this context 
to mean ""any time when the acquisition threatens to ripen into a prohibited effect"")."
773,25," Plaintiffs argued repeatedly that the ""incipiency doctrine"" remains the controlling precedent. See, e.g., First Amended 
Complaint ¶ 47 (asserting that the line of Supreme Court cases relying on the ""incipiency doctrine"" has ""never been overruled 
and remains controlling law""); Plaintiffs' Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law ¶ 15 (""Plaintiffs' Proposed 
FOF/COL"") [Adv. Proc. ECF No. 273] (citing a line of ""binding Supreme Court precedents [that] recognized and developed what 
is known as the 'incipiency doctrine'""); Hr'g Tr. at 10:25-11:5 (Mar. 11, 2019) (stating that the Plaintiffs ""also rely on the Supreme 
Court decisions, none of which have been overruled, and no action has been taken by Congress to overrule them, and with 
regard to those cases, [the Plaintiffs] will be following the law on them""); Hr'g Tr. at 1274:13-1280:25 (Mar. 15, 2019) (cross-
examining Defendants' expert witness, Dr. Carlton, concerning his writings on ""decisions by the Supreme Court . . . with regard 
to mergers""). "
774,26," In its Summary Judgment Decision, the Court rejected the Plaintiffs' national market theory. See Summary Judgment Decision 
at 27:8-9 (holding that the Plaintiffs' national market theory is ""as deficient as ever""); Hr'g Tr. at 54:11-14 (Mar. 11, 2019) 
(Defendants stating that they ""agree that the relevant markets are city pairs"" and noting that the Court has ""already held that 
there is no national market"")."
774,27," The Court held in its Summary Judgment Decision that Plaintiffs lacked standing in their capacity as travel agents as they 
were not ""efficient enforcers"" of antitrust laws. Summary Judgment Decision at 47:15-19. In reaching its conclusion, the Court 
noted that ""Plaintiffs [were required to] demonstrate that they [had] remained actual customers in the alleged relevant markets "
775,," and made plans to patronize those markets again."" Id. at 42:11-13 (citing In re N.J. Title Ins. Litig., 683 F.3d 451, 461 (3d Cir. 
2012)). The Court notes that the Defendants continue to dispute that Plaintiffs have in fact established standing. See Defendants' 
Proposed FOF/COL, Section IV(G) (arguing that Plaintiffs lack standing). But for the reasons summarized above and set forth in 
the Court's prior decisions, the Court overrules the Defendants' objection based on standing."
775,28," The Court further notes that the Plaintiffs, in fact, listed only 296 city-pairs—as opposed to 298—in their trial exhibit, a 
discrepancy not explained during trial. See PX-149 (listing 296 city-pairs as the relevant market)."
775,29," The Plaintiffs state that the 204 city-pairs listed in Table A to the Plaintiffs' Proposed FOF/COL are comprised ""[o]f the city 
pairs . . . which Plaintiffs have flown or will fly in the future [where] presumptively illegal concentrations exist."" Plaintiffs' Proposed 
FOF/COL ¶ 165. The Court understands the 204 city-pairs to indicate that the Named Plaintiffs have flown or will fly on 204 of 
the 765 city-pairs that Dr. Lundgren previously identified in the 2018 Lundgren Declaration as having presumptively illegal post-
Merger HHI concentration levels and level increases under the Horizontal Merger Guidelines. See also Hr'g Tr. at 17:3-10 (Apr. 
26, 2019) (Plaintiffs' counsel stating that ""there is the 765, which was an initial . . . part of the presumptive illegal markets. The 
204, you know . . . are the presumptive illegal markets in which the Plaintiffs flew on . . . [and allege] would likely fly in the 
future"")."
775,30," The language of Section 7 is forward-looking in assessing an acquisition that ""may"" substantially lessen competition. 15 
U.S.C. § 18; see also E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 353 U.S. at 597 (noting that the objective of the Clayton Antitrust Act was 
""primarily to arrest apprehended consequences of inter corporate relationships before those relationships could work their evil, 
which may be at or any time after the acquisition, depending on the circumstances of the case""); H.R. REP. NO. 94-1373, at 7 
(1976), as reprinted in 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2637 (noting that ""Section 7 is an 'incipiency' statute . . . intended to halt monopolies 
and restraints of trade in their initial stages, before they ripen into full-scale Sherman Act violations""). The federal pre-merger "
776,," notification and waiting-period system for large mergers and acquisitions established under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust 
Improvements Act of 1976 (the ""HSR Act""), 15 U.S.C. § 18a, has contributed to this trend of pre-merger challenges. See ABA 
Antitrust Law Section, Competition/Consumer Protection Policy and North American Comments Task Force, Analyzing the 
Scope of Enforcement Actions Against Consummated Mergers in a Time of Heightened Scrutiny (Apr. 2020) at 1-2 & n.3, 
https://ourcuriousamalgam.com/wp-content/uploads/Consummated-Mergers-Policy-Task-Force-Apr-2020-FINAL.pdf (noting that 
""most U.S. merger enforcement challenges are made before the underlying merger has taken place"" in part due to an emphasis 
on pre-merger analysis under the HSR Act); see also H.R. REP. NO. 94-1373, at 8 (stating that the HSR Act was proposed to 
provide the government a ""realistic chance"" to challenge mergers and address larger mergers before they ""become almost 
unchallengeable"" post-consummation). Indeed, challenges to mergers have occurred prior to or shortly after consummation. 
See, e.g., E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 353 U.S. at 598 (noting that ""[p]rior cases under [Section] 7 were brought at or near 
the time of acquisition""); Baker Hughes, 908 F.2d 981, 285 U.S. App. D.C. 222 (reviewing a lower court's denial to issue an 
injunction to enjoin a proposed acquisition); Anthem, 855 F.3d 345, 428 U.S. App. D.C. 403 (reviewing a lower court's granting of 
a permanent injunction of a proposed merger between the second- and third-largest national health insurance carriers); see also 
New York v. Kraft Gen. Foods Inc., 926 F. Supp. 321 (S.D.N.Y. 1995) (assessing a Section 7 challenge to a merger brought 
approximately 5 weeks after its consummation); United States v. Bazaarvoice, Inc., No. 13-CV-00133-WHO, 2014 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 3284, 2014 WL 203966 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 8, 2014) (assessing a Section 7 challenge to a merger approximately one year 
after the merger closed). "
777,31," Notably, Defendants ""[do] not assert that Plaintiffs have failed to meet their prima facie burden."" Defendants' Proposed 
FOF/COL ¶ 70."
777,32," As previously noted, Dr. Lundgren attempted to replicate the DOJ's HHI figures as set forth in the DOJ Complaint and 
acknowledged that although there was a 98% correlation between his calculations and the DOJ's calculations, ""most [of his] HHI 
calculation[s] . . . showed deviations."" Lundgren Report at 5. Nonetheless, Dr. Lundgren believed that, because of the high 
correlation between the two sets of figures, any antitrust conclusions derived would essentially be the same. See id. at 14. Since 
only an approximation is required to establish a prima facie case, the Court will not address the precision of Dr. Lundgren's HHI 
calculations at this juncture. Indeed, Defendants do not take any position as to the accuracy of Dr. Lundgren's calculation of HHI 
figures in his various reports and declarations. See Defendants' Proposed FOF/COL ¶ 69. "
779,33," American's estimate was achieved through QSI modeling, a planning tool generally utilized among airline carriers in the 
ordinary course to predict traffic levels for schedules of flights by all carriers. See Carlton Dir. Ex. ¶ 27."
779,34," Dr. Carlton's estimated fare increases were based on the following: (1) ""Baseline fare concentration effects"" figures derived 
from Dr. Carlton's own study and (2) ""BLS fare effects"" figures derived from Jan K. Brueckner, Darin Lee & Ethan S. Singer, 
Airline Competition and Domestic US Airfares: A Comprehensive Reappraisal, 2 ECON. OF TRANSP. 1 (2013). Carlton Dir. Ex. ¶ 
32 & n.2."
779,35," The fare increase estimates were predicated upon the assumption that there would be ""no rival response to a merger which 
combine[d] two carriers on a route."" Carlton Dir. Ex. ¶ 32."
779,36," The 2013 prospective study did not account for the divestitures that were a part of the DOJ Settlement. See Carlton Dir. Ex. ¶ 
35. Dr. Carlton opined that the estimated net consumer benefits would be even greater to the extent the DOJ Settlement 
produced additional benefits to consumers. See id."
779,37," The data used for the 2016 study was derived from the DB1B database, the same database used by Dr. Lundgren, as well as 
airline schedules from the Official Airline Guide and the T100 (Form 41) database from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. 
See Carlton Dir. Ex. ¶ 40."
779,38," To estimate changes in quality-adjusted fares that cannot generally be directly computed, Dr. Carlton relied on the assumption 
that output as measured in number of passengers and quality-adjusted fares were inversely related. See Carlton Dir. Ex. ¶ 39 
(noting that this was done to recognize that quality-adjusted fares may have decreased despite an increase in nominal fares)."
779,39," The ""difference-in-differences"" estimation methodology, a ""standard econometric technique,"" is a form of multiple regression 
analysis that compares changes in a treatment group versus changes in a control group to capture general trends while 
controlling for outside factors. See Carlton Dir. Ex. ¶ 38 (summarizing the ""difference-in-differences"" estimation methodology); 
see also Hr'g Tr. at 1248:3-11 (Mar. 15, 2019) (Carlton testifying that the difference-in-differences methodology is used to 
""evaluate the effect of . . . a treatment, in this case a merger . . . [and] allows you to isolate what is the effect of . . . the merger as 
distinct from all other factors in the industry"")."
779,40," The 2016 retrospective study examined both nonstop and connecting routes. With respect to nonstop routes, the ""treatment"" 
group was comprised of pre-merger routes where the merging parties were either the only two nonstop carriers (""2-to-1 nonstop "
780,," routes"") or were two of three nonstop carriers (""3-to-2 nonstop routes""). See Carlton Dir. Ex. ¶ 41. In contrast, the ""control group"" 
was generally comprised of connecting or non-nonstop overlapping routes comprised of the same number of nonstop carriers as 
those in the ""treatment"" group during the respective pre-merger period. Id. Similar analysis was used to examine overlap 
connecting routes, comparing such routes against non-overlap connecting routes. Id."
780,41," Plaintiffs criticize Dr. Carlton for his failure to individually address all of the 1,008 city-pairs identified as presumptively illegal in 
the Lundgren Report as well as the subset of 298 city-pairs initially comprising the relevant market for this proceeding. See 
Plaintiffs' Proposed FOF/COL ¶ 327 (""Dr. Carlton's study did not analyze all 1,008 city pair relevant markets identified in 
Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint or all 298 city pairs identified by Plaintiffs in this case""). The Court notes that Dr. Carlton's 
analysis was prepared prior to the commencement of trial during which time the number of city-pairs that Plaintiffs sought to "
781,," include as the relevant market was in flux. As previously discussed, the Plaintiffs further modified the number of relevant city-
pairs downward to 204 after the start of trial. See Plaintiffs' Proposed FOF/COL, Table A. Given the changing scope and number 
of relevant city-pairs over the course of this proceeding, the Court rejects Plaintiffs' criticism of Dr. Carlton on this score. "
782,42," Plaintiffs, citing to a study prepared by the Government Accounting Office, have argued that the Southwest Effect ""may not be 
as prominent following a merger,"" a contention derived from a finding that Southwest had raised fares in markets following the 
mergers of Delta and Northwest and US Airways and America West. Hr'g Tr. at 427:12-428:6 (Mar. 11, 2019). However, as 
noted, Plaintiffs' own witnesses, including Dr. Lundgren, have offered both statements and anecdotal observations which detract 
from Plaintiffs' assertions. Additionally, Plaintiffs' assertions run contrary to the findings set forth in the paper, ""Airline Competition and Domestic U.S. 
Airfares: A Comprehensive Reappraisal,"" published in the Economics of Transportation, which both parties refer to and rely upon 
for its methodologies. See Brueckner, Lee & Singer, supra note 34; Lundgren Report at 9 & n.3 (describing his adoption of the 
authors' approach for combining airports into city markets in an attempt to replicate the DOJ's HHI figures); Lundgren Report, 
Ex. B (including a copy of the cited paper); Carlton Dir. Ex. ¶ 32 (discussing his use of the authors' fare estimates in addition to 
his own to evaluate the impact of the Merger). The Court notes the paper concludes that ""most forms of legacy-carrier 
competition have weak effects on average fares"" while LCC competition has ""dramatic fare impacts, whether it occurs on the 
airport-pair, at adjacent airports, or as potential competition."" Brueckner, Lee & Singer, supra note 34, at 1; see also id. at 2 
(highlighting the study's empirical findings that show decreases in airfares where LCCs are present)."
782,43," Plaintiffs argue that there are substantial barriers to entry in the airline industry based on the assertion that there have not 
been any major airline entrants to the market in recent years. See First Amended Complaint, ¶¶ 159-60 (stating that there have 
only been two new major carrier entrants in recent years and no ""new, viable competitors in the national market since 2000""); 
Plaintiffs' Proposed FOF/COL ¶¶ 181, 185 (noting testimony of Daniel Kasper acknowledging that Virgin America was the last 
major airline carrier to enter the market in 2007) (citing Hr'g Tr. at 1040:16-22 (Mar. 14, 2019)). But Plaintiffs do not themselves 
provide any further evidence or analysis to support their contention, which the Court finds unpersuasive given the continued 
expansion of LCCs."
782,44," Indeed, as previously discussed, the Merger itself was driven in part by a desire to strengthen American and US Airways' 
ability to compete with LCCs and ULCCs. See Parker Dir. Ex. ¶ 32 (noting that LCCs have ""entered many of these routes since 
the Merger""); Kasper Dir. Ex. ¶ 73 (noting that American's initial foray into bankruptcy was driven in part by ""heightened 
competition from LCCs""). The recent gate and slot divestitures that were part of the DOJ Settlement may further strengthen the 
competitive position of LCCs. See Carlton Dir. Ex. ¶ 17 (noting that the role of LCC competition was ""enhanced by the slot and 
gate divestitures agreed to in the settlement of the DOJ litigation""). "
783,45," Defendants have further argued that the Merger resulted in additional procompetitive efficiencies, stemming from the 
combination of American and US Airways' complementary networks. They believed that the merging of the airlines' networks 
would yield ""significant benefits for consumers, particularly with respect to travel options""—resulting in procompetitive benefits to 
consumers generally as well as to smaller communities—and increased efficiencies in infrastructure investments and the 
expansion of its fleet aircraft. Defendants' Proposed FOF/COL ¶ 89; see id. ¶¶ 95, 97-98; Kasper Dir. Ex. ¶ 86. "
785,46," While the Plaintiffs' argument about whether the Merger was really necessary is not the relevant inquiry now before this Court, 
Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that the standalone plan was as good or better in creating value for stakeholders as the Merger. 
Indeed, the Merger that was the basis for AMR's ultimate plan of reorganization, eventually proved to be highly successful in 
maximizing value for its constituents and stakeholders, including providing for recovery to equityholders, a rare occurrence in 
Chapter 11 proceedings. See, e.g., Conor Shine, What's Next for American Airlines Five Years After its Merger with US Airways, 
Dall. Morning News, Dec. 9, 2018, https://www.dallasnews.com/business/local-companies/2018/12/09/what-s-next-for-american-

11-idUSL1N0BF0T020130215 (highlighting that American's shareholders expected to receive recoveries valued at 
approximately $350 to $400 million, something ""unusual in Chapter 11 cases—and unprecedented in recent airline 
restructurings"")."
785,47," The phrase, ""unweighted average,"" simply refers to an arithmetic mean. See Hr'g Tr. at 1262:22-1263:20 (Mar. 15, 2019) 
(Carlton testifying that Dr. Lundgren took a ""simple average"" of fluctuations in average fares). In contrast, a ""weighted average"" 
is defined to be ""an average that can attach more importance (weight) to some observations than to others."" GRAHAM UPTON &

785,48," Of the 298 city-pairs parties comprising the relevant market at the beginning of trial, 78 city-pair routes had nominal average 
fares that decreased, resulting in only 220 city-pairs reflecting an unweighted increase. See PX-149; see also supra note 28 
(noting that PX-149 lists 296 city-pairs as opposed to 298). Of the remaining 204 city-pairs being considered at the end of trial, 
Plaintiffs identified 54 city-pair routes where nominal average fares had decreased, resulting in 150 city-pairs reflecting an 
unweighted increase. See Plaintiffs' Proposed FOF/COL, Table B. "
787,49," As previously noted, the Court rejected the admission of the Lundgren Supplemental Report to the extent that it sought to 
include new opinions concerning the competitive impact of the Merger. See Exclusion Order at 4-7 (denying the Plaintiffs' 
request to admit the Lundgren Supplemental Report on grounds that, among other things, the Lundgren Supplemental Report 
did not constitute a ""supplement"" under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 26(e) and the timing of the request was 
inappropriate); see also Reconsideration Order (denying Plaintiffs' request for permission to serve the Lundgren Supplemental 
Report or, in the alternative, for the Court to reconsider the ruling under the Exclusion Order). As the underlying reasoning for 
the exclusion of the Lundgren Supplemental Report is set forth in detail in the Exclusion and Reconsideration Orders, the Court 
will not repeat that analysis here today. "
788,50," The Court had previously highlighted this issue in its Summary Judgment Decision and Plaintiffs have not made any effort to 
address this problem at trial. See Summary Judgment Decision at 43:19-22 (stating that the ""Court agrees with the Defendants 
about the generality and irrelevance of many of the complaints and statements included""). "
800,1," Defendants do not seek dismissal of Plaintiffs' claims for California trademark dilution (Count 6) or unfair competition by 
misappropriation (Count 8). Defendants do mention Plaintiffs' claim for common law unfair competition (Count 9); however, for 
the reasons that follow, the Court declines to entertain Defendants' arguments for dismissing this claim. "
801,2," Defendants filed an amended reply in order to remove a section from their original reply that applied the common control 
exception to Plaintiffs' Lanham Act claims for the first time. (See Dkt. # 47 at 1 n.1.) "
802,3," Plaintiffs do not oppose Defendants' request for dismissal of their claim for Unlawful Importation of Goods Infringing U.S. 
Trademarks or Names, 15 U.S.C. § 124 and 19 U.S.C. § 1526 (Count 4). (See Dkt. # 41 at 5 n.1.)"
802,4," Alternatively, Plaintiffs request that the Court order limited jurisdictional discovery. (Dkt. # 41.) However, because the Court 
finds that Ultra Mundiales is subject to personal jurisdiction in Texas, jurisdictional discovery is not necessary. "
803,5," Defendants rely on Halliburton for the proposition that a single contractual relationship with a Texas entity does not establish 
minimum contacts with Texas. But Halliburton is substantially different from this case. In Halliburton, the plaintiffs argued that the 
defendants were subject to personal jurisdiction in California because they sold one insurance policy to a Texas resident. 921 
F.3d at 544. The Fifth Circuit found that this was not purposeful availment. Id. This case, however, requires an analysis under 
the stream of commerce approach and involves two entities that have close connections such that the foreign entity should have 
been aware that its products were being sold in the forum state. Thus, Halliburton provides little guidance in this case."
803,6," Plaintiffs point out that Mr. Garza-Abdo similarly indicated on his LinkedIn profile that he is the Managing Director of ""Ultra 
Distribuciones Internacionales."" (Dkt. # 41-1, Ex. 3.) "
805,7," HN11[
] ""The Fifth Circuit has held a difference in the physical appearance of a product is a material difference so long as the 
defendant is unable to show that an average consumer would not consider the differences in purchasing the product.""

(N.D. Tex. May 23, 2019) (citing Martin's Herend Imports, Inc. v. Diamond & Gem Trading USA, Co., 112 F.3d 1296, 1301-02 
(5th Cir. 1997))."
805,8, The Court addresses the false designation of origin claim in more detail in Section III.C. 
806,9," The court stated, But this is not a ""gray market"" goods case. . . . Accordingly, there is no danger that consumers are likely to be confused as 
to the source of the Summit laser systems—the main concern of trademark law. On the face of the Complaint, Summit 
admits that all of the laser systems in question [**25]  are manufactured and distributed by Summit itself, not by any foreign 
manufacturer. Although the various laser systems may have ""material"" differences, they are all genuine Summit 
manufactured products—none are ""gray market"" goods. Summit Tech., Inc. v. High-Line Med. Instruments Co., 922 F. Supp. 299, 310 (C.D. Cal. 1996)."
806,10," Sandoz is not helpful here for a similar reason. Sandoz Pharms. Corp. v. Richardson-Vicks, Inc., 902 F.2d 222, 231 (3d Cir. 
1990). In Sandoz, the plaintiff's cause of action under the Lanham Act was based on the fact that the defendant labeled an "
807,," ingredient as ""inactive"" when FDA standards appeared to require that the ingredient be labeled as ""active."" Id. at 230-31. 
Because the FDA had not found conclusively that the ingredient should have been labelled as ""active,"" the court dismissed the 
claim because the plaintiff's arguments would have required the court ""to usurp administrative agencies' responsibility for 
interpreting and enforcing potentially ambiguous regulations."" Id. at 231. Issues similar to the one in Sandoz are not present in 
this case. "
808,11," The Court recognizes that Pizza Hut involved a false advertising claim under 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a)(1)(B), not a false 
designation of origin claim under § 1125(a)(1)(A). See Pizza Hut, Inc. v. Papa Johns Int'l, Inc., 227 F.3d 489, 494-95 (5th Cir. 
2000). Although there are a few courts in this circuit that have decided not to apply the Pizza Hut elements to claims under § 
1125(a)(1)(A), the majority of courts within this circuit apply these elements to claims brought under both subsections. See York 
Grp., Inc. v. York S., Inc., No. H-06-0262, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 78052, 2006 WL 3057782, at *4 (S.D. Tex. Oct. 26, 2006) 
(citing cases construing both sections); see also Dupart v. Roussell, No. 20-1406, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 200608, 2020 WL 
6308339, at *10 (E.D. La. Oct. 28, 2020) (explaining that Pizza Hut applies to false advertising claims and false designation of 
origin claims); Deaf Interpreter Servs., Inc. v. Webbco Enters., L.L.C., No. 5:13-867-RCL, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 181339, 2015 
WL 11565191, at *12 n.9 (W.D. Tex. Feb. 11, 2015) (""Although the Pizza Hut case arises from a false advertising claim, courts 
in this circuit apply the same legal standard to false designation of origin claims as well.""); Heartbrand Beef, Inc. v. Lobel's of 
N.Y., LLC, No. V-08-62, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8822, 2009 WL 311087, at *2 (S.D. Tex. Feb. 5, 2009) (""Fortunately, while there 
appears to be confusion over terminology and code sections, the Fifth Circuit consistently lists five elements to be proven 
whether the claim arises under subsection (a)(1)(A) or (B), and regardless of what the claim is labeled.""). "
809,12," Some courts have held that the common law tort also includes acts that are analogous to ""passing off,"" ""such as the sale of 
confusingly similar products, by which a person exploits a competitor's reputation in the market."" Bank of the W. v. Superior 
Court, 883 P.2d 545, 551 (Cal. 1992). According to one federal district court, the cornerstone of a common law unfair 
competition claim is fraud. See Mattel, Inc. v. MGA Entm't, Inc., 782 F. Supp. 2d 911, 1013 (C.D. Cal. 2011)."
809,13," Defendants do not address the issue of ""passing off"" in their motion to dismiss. (See Dkt. # 37.) When stating that the 
elements for California statutory unfair competition claims are the same as the elements for common law claims, Defendants cite 
the unfair competition statute and a case that does not involve a common law claim. (Dkt. # 37); see Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 
17200; CYBERsitter, LLC v. Google, Inc., 905 F. Supp. 2d 1080, 1087 (C.D. Cal. 2012). Defendants bring their standing 
arguments only in the context of the statutory claim. (See Dkts. ## 37, 47.) Their other arguments with respect to failure to plead 
unlawful, unfair, or fraudulent conduct are also brought in the context of the statutory claim. (Id.) "
811,14," Because the Court finds that Plaintiffs have alleged economic injury, the Court need not analyze whether Plaintiffs' allegations 
that Defendants' acts damaged Plaintiffs' relationships with its customers, distributors, and other business partners constitute an 
""economic injury"" within the meaning of the UCL."
811,15," The California Supreme Court has held that UCL claims brought under the fraud prong require ""actual reliance"" rather than 
mere causation. In re Tobacco II, 46 Cal. 4th 298, 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d 559, 207 P.3d 20, 39 (Cal. 2009). The California Supreme 
Court has refrained from extending this to other prongs under the UCL that are not based on misrepresentation and deception. 
See Kwikset Corp. v. Superior Court, 51 Cal. 4th 310, 120 Cal. Rptr. 3d 741, 246 P.3d 877, 888 n.9 (Cal. 2011); In re Tobacco II, 
207 P.3d at 39 n.17."
811,16," The Northern District of California pointed out that ""'[n]o California [state] court has addressed' whether 'competitor plaintiffs 
must plead their own reliance or whether pleading consumer reliance is sufficient for fraudulent business practice claims brought 
by competitors.' [And while] [t]here is a split among district courts sitting in California on this issue, . . . the majority view appears 
to be that a plaintiff must be able to allege its own reliance 'rather than the reliance of third parties.'"" 23andMe, Inc. v. 
Ancestry.com DNA, LLC, 356 F. Supp. 3d 889, 911 (N.D. Cal. 2018) (quoting A White & Yellow Cab, Inc. v. Uber Techs., Inc., 
No. 15-CV-05163-JSW, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 49803, 2017 WL 1208384, at *8 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 31, 2017)). As the court in 
23andMe also pointed out, this makes sense because traditional fraud claims cannot be premised on third-party reliance. Id."
811,17," Defendants rely on an unpublished case, Quadrant Information Services, LLC v. LexisNexis Risk Solutions, Inc., in support of 
their argument that Plaintiffs' allegations are not sufficient to establish standing. No. C 11-6648 SBA, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
108597, 2012 WL 3155559, at *3-4 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 2, 2012). However, Quadrant is different. In Quadrant, the district court found 
that Plaintiffs' conclusory allegation that ""[Plaintiff] has suffered injury in fact and has lost money as a result of [Defendant's] 
unfair competition"" was insufficient to establish standing. 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 108597, [WL] at *4. The allegations that 
Plaintiffs incorporate by reference into their unfair competition claim are not conclusory, they include detailed factual allegations, 
pictures of the products, and an explanation of their alleged injuries. (See Dkt. # 26.) "
812,18," Actual reliance is not required for the unlawful conduct prong as it was in Kwikset because not all of Plaintiffs' causes of action 
are solely based on misrepresentation and deception. See Kwikset, 246 P.3d at 888 n.9; (Dkt. # 26.)"
812,19," Although Plaintiffs cite several cases where courts found that the fraud prong and the unlawful prong were met when the 
plaintiff alleged violation of trademark laws, those courts did not address the standing issue or analyze the fraud prong in depth. 
See Baskin-Robbins Franchising LLC v. Chun, No. 18-CV-05476-BLF, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118457, 2019 WL 3207777, at *5 
(N.D. Cal. July 16, 2019) (entering default judgment for unfair competition without providing an in-depth explanation of the fraud 
prong or grappling with standing issues); JS Led Tech. Corp. v. Zhang, No. CV-14-02250-RGK (PJWx), 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
199449, 2014 WL 12561075, at *9 (C.D. Cal. Aug. 7, 2014) (denying the defendant's motion to dismiss the plaintiff's unfair 
competition claim merely because the plaintiff sufficiently alleged claims for state trademark infringement); Celebrity Chefs Tour, 
LLC v. Macy's Inc., 16 F. Supp. 3d 1141, 1156 (S.D. Cal. 2014) (analyzing the fraud prong without addressing the standing 
requirements). "
817,1," This Memorandum & Order amends the court's previous Memorandum & Order, issued on January 25, 2021, to clarify aspects 
of the court's ruling identified in the parties' letter of January 27, 2021. (See Jan. 25, 2021 Mem. & Order (Dkt. 63); Letter re 
Parties' Request for Clarification on 12(c) Ruling (Dkt. 64).) "
820,2," See N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 356:14 (""In any action or prosecution under this chapter, the courts may be guided by 
interpretations of the United States' antitrust laws.""). "
823,3," Plaintiffs' argument that Bennett overlooks Freeman is not convincing in light of the fact that Bennett cites to Freeman's 
""substantial effects"" test in full. See id. at 756."
823,4," In Amex's opening memorandum in support of this motion, it sought judgment on the pleadings with respect to Plaintiffs' claim 
under Ohio consumer protection law, and Plaintiffs conceded that claim in their opposition. (See Mem. at 18-19; Opp. at 1 n.1.) 
However, in light of binding case law decided during the pendency of this motion, Amex concedes in its Reply that the relevant 
class action limitations under Ohio law do not apply in federal court, and—notwithstanding Plaintiffs' previous concession—it 
therefore agrees that Plaintiffs may proceed with their claims under Ohio consumer protection law at this stage of the 
proceedings. (Reply at 1 n.1 (citing La Liberte v. Reid, 966 F.3d 79 (2d Cir. 2020)).) "
824,5," Plaintiffs rely on In re Solodyn (Minocycline Hydrochloride) Antitrust Litig., No. 14-md-2503 (DJC), 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
125999, 2015 WL 5458570, at *16 (D. Mass. Sept. 16, 2015), for the proposition that they have satisfied the ""intrastate"" pleading "
825,," standard. That argument is unavailing, because In re Solodyn concerned the state's antitrust law, not its consumer protection 
law and the attendant requirement that the alleged harm be primarily intrastate. "
843,1," For instance, although In re Lower Lake Erie Iron Ore Antitrust Litigation, 998 F.2d 1144, 1164 (3d Cir. 1993) appeared to 
credit the argument that Illinois Brick applies only where the plaintiffs would recover from a common fund, Warren General made 
clear that the rule applies regardless of whether the rationales from Illinois Brick are implicated in any particular case. 643 F.3d 
at 96 (quoting UtiliCorp, 497 U.S. at 216). And, as noted, the Supreme Court reiterated the same point in Apple, just last year. "
846,1," Defendant Alphabet, Inc. was dismissed on September 8, 2020, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(1)(A)(i). Dkt. 
21. "
849,2," Both of which the Court has incorporated by reference, see supra Section III.B. "
864,1," It is also not clear that patent misuse is subject to Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b) to the extent it relies on allegations of inequitable 
conduct. See Reinforced Earth Co. v. T&B Structural Sys., No. 3:12-CV-2704-N, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 189863, 2013 WL 
10989994, at *7 (N.D. Tex. Jan. 30, 2013) (collecting cases). Because the Court will strike the patent misuse defense for other 
reasons, this question need not be answered. "
865,2," As mentioned, the '635 Patent is still stayed and only the '091 Patent is set for trial. "
866,3," In fact, Apple does not even allege anticompetitive effects—a necessary element of patent misuse—anywhere in its Answer. 
Even if the Court did not strike Apple's patent misuse defense for the Discovery Order violation, the Court would be inclined to 
strike it for that reason. "
870,1," The parties have consented to the jurisdiction of the undersigned magistrate judge for all purposes pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 
636(c)."
870,2," All citations herein to Safti's answer and counterclaim refer to the paragraphs of the counterclaim portion of that document, 
which begins at the bottom of page 4. "
871,3, Intumescent material expands when heated in order to serve as insulation in the event of a fire.
871,4," The '475 patent appears in the record in a number of places, including as Exhibit 1 to attorney Philip Bautista's declaration (dkt. 
187-1) in support of Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment."

2020). "
877,8," UL (also known as Underwriters Laboratory) and Intertek are two recognized authorities for certifying compliance with safety 
standards."
877,9," Plaintiffs also briefly argue in their motion for summary judgment that Safti abandoned its counterclaims by failing to reassert 
them in its answer to Plaintiffs' third amended complaint, citing two district court decisions. Pls.' MSJ at 17-18 (citing Bryant v. 
Mattel, Inc., No. CV 04-9049 DOC (RNBx), 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 147643, 2010 WL 11463865, at *5 (C.D. Cal. Oct. 5, 2010); 
Johnson v. Berry, 228 F. Supp. 2d 1071, 1079 (E.D. Mo. 2002)). Johnson held as Plaintiffs argue here, addressing a point not 
raised by any party, in the context of defaults by multiple parties. Bryant held only that a party need not move for leave to amend 
to modify its counterclaims when it files a new answer to a new complaint. Neither Safti's opposition brief nor Plaintiffs' reply 
addresses this argument further. Plaintiffs do not suggest that they were prejudiced by Safti's failure to reassert its counterclaims 
or lacked notice that Safti still intended to pursue them. To the extent that Safti was required to reassert its counterclaims in its 
most recent answer, the liberal amendment policies of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure would require allowing Safti to 
amend its answer to do so. Cf. Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2), (b). The Court therefore deems Safti's answer to the third amended 
complaint amended to incorporate the counterclaim portion of its previous answer. "
878,10," Safti further asserts that Greenlite advertised itself as—in Safti's words—making ""the only floor available in North America for 
exterior use,"" but the only evidence Safti cites for that purported misrepresentation consists of pages that do not appear in the 
deposition excerpt Safti has provided. See Def.'s Opp'n to MSJ at 16 (citing pages 199, 200 and 203 of Exhibit 8 to attorney 
Mark Schickman's declaration submitted with the opposition); Schickman Opp'n Decl. (dkt. 201-1) Ex. 8 (including only pages 1, 
46-49, 67, 96-105, and 122 of Ryan Dennett's deposition transcript). The Court disregards that assertion as unsupported by 
evidence."
878,11," Safti initially filed its evidentiary objections as separate documents, in violation of the Court's local rules regarding briefing and 
page limits. The Court granted Safti a period of three days to remedy the error by filing a corrected opposition brief incorporating 
all evidentiary objections within the allowed page limit. See dkt. 196. Plaintiffs object in their reply that Safti used that time not 
only to incorporate its objections within the brief, but also to alter and expand on its substantive arguments. Plaintiffs ask the 
Court to strike the corrected opposition brief entirely or to disregard the new material. While Safti's approach was perhaps a 
questionable response to the Court's order, the order did not expressly limit how Safti could alter its brief, and Plaintiffs were not 
prejudiced by the changes because the Court altered the briefing schedule to allow Plaintiffs sufficient time to respond. The 
Court therefore declines to strike any portion of Safti's corrected brief. The Court also declines Plaintiffs' invitation to strike any of 
Safti's briefs for being filed hours after the deadlines to do so, but admonishes Safti that further untimely filings may be stricken 
or result in other sanctions. The Court does not reach Safti's evidentiary objections to the redline comparisons of the opposition 
brief submitted with Plaintiffs' reply. See dkt. 209. "
883,12," Safti's briefs in some instances describe the product as containing nine layers, a figure Safti reaches by treating the three 
layers of thicker glass at the top as single layer of structural glass. "
884,13," This limitation is included in claim 1, the only independent claim for which Plaintiffs assert infringement, and the basis for all of 
the dependent claims Plaintiffs assert. "
885,14," The measurements in O'Keeffe's declaration total to a thickness of 5"" for the GPX 120 product as a whole, which is close to, 
but not entirely consistent with, the 5 3/16"" thickness reported in the GPX 120 product fact sheet. See Bautista MSJ Decl. Ex. 4 
(MacFarlane Opening Report) Ex. AA. Dr. Stevick's Reply Infringement Report, which Safti also cites for the thickness of the 
layers, confirms O'Keeffe's figures for the thickness of the glass layers but does not address the thickness of the intumescent 
material. Schickman MSJ Decl. Ex. 2 (Stevick Reply Report) ¶ 17(e). The difference may be due to thin layers of adhesive 
between the layers of ."" thick structural glass, but it is not clearly addressed in the record. Assuming for the sake of argument 
that the adhesive adds no thickness and there is a conflict between O'Keeffe's declaration and the product fact sheet, 
extrapolating from the 5 3/16"" measurement in the product fact sheet and Dr. Stevick's report on the thickness of the glass 
layers would result in a very slightly greater thickness for the layers that Plaintiffs contend are fire rated, and thus a slightly 
greater discrepancy between those layers and the SuperLite XLB product."
885,15," In response to some of Safti's other arguments for non-infringement—related, for example, to the presence or absence of load 
transferring means, the presence or absence of a gap between layers, and the transmission of load between layers—Plaintiffs 
contend that different products purportedly tested or advertised by Safti infringe the '475 patent even if the GPX 120 product 
does not infringe as sold, and that the doctrine of equivalents applies even if Safti did not literally infringe. Plaintiffs present no 
such argument on the question of whether Safti's products contain a ""fire rated"" layer, and have identified no evidence from 
which the Court could conclude either that some other Safti product contains such a layer or that the layers of glass at issue are 
equivalent to a ""fire rated"" layer, or more generally that constructing a glass floor that includes any fire resistant layer is 
equivalent to one that includes a separately rated layer. "
886,16," The Court has not scrutinized every page of each exhibit—some of which consist of technical engineering documents running 
to well over one hundred pages—in an attempt to find any portion that might be relevant. See Keenan, 91 F.3d at 1279 (""As 
other courts have noted, '[i]t is not our task, or that of the district court, to scour the record in search of a genuine issue of triable 
fact. We rely on the non-moving party to identify with reasonable particularity the evidence that precludes summary judgment.'"" 
(citations omitted)). The Court has reviewed each page of evidence specifically cited, as well as Plaintiffs' description of that 
evidence, and has found nothing that would carry Plaintiffs' burden to show that the GPX 120 product contains within it a distinct 
layer of ""fire rated glass."""
886,17," Moreover, Exhibit T to Tim MacFarlane's report (cited in this paragraph) is not included with the copy of that report in 
evidence, which skips from Exhibit S to Exhibit U. Based on the Bates numbers cited, that document may be the same as Exhibit 
3 to the declaration of Donald McPhail submitted with Plaintiffs' opposition brief, but that exhibit does not indicate that the lower 
portion of the GPX 120 product is separately fire rated. "
887,18," There does not appear to be any evidence that this drawing, which differed from diagrams included in Safti's bid package, was 
ever shown to anyone associated with the Transbay project. The PTAB held that whether the buyer was aware of the nature of 
the product offered for sale was immaterial to whether the invention was offered for sale. See McPhail Opp'n Decl. Ex. 6 at 34-
35. "
890,19," Claim 24 of the '475 patent, which Dr. Stevick also asserts is invalidated by Figure 1, similarly requires a ""load transferring 
means."" "
891,20," The Court does not rely on MacFarlane's opinion that the patented product achieved significant commercial success as an 
indication of non-obviousness. Safti is likely correct that such an opinion falls outside of MacFarlane's expertise, but the Court 
need not reach that question because the opinion is not necessary to the conclusion that Safti has not met its evidentiary 
burden. "
892,21," While Dr. Stevick addresses both independent claim 1 and independent claim 24 of the '475 patent as purportedly anticipated 
by Figure 1 of the '475 patent, he only addresses claim 1 as purportedly anticipated by the French patent. "
897,22," Safti also asserts that Greenlite falsely advertised selling ""the only floor available in North America,"" but cites no evidence for 
that except pages of Dennett's deposition transcript that are not included in the record before the Court. Def.'s Opp'n to MSJ at 
16. To the extent Safti bases its claims on that purported misrepresentation, Plaintiffs are entitled to summary judgment because 
there is no evidence in the record that Greenlite actually made such a representation. "

in the market for listing services, id. at ¶¶ 106-15, but in so doing, it 'cut[s] off' PLS's access to a supply, pocket real estate 
listings, that is 'necessary to enable the boycotted firm'—PLS—'to compete.'"" Pl.'s Suppl. Brief 7:1-7 (quoting Nw. Wholesale

Sunday Ticket Antitrust Litig., 933 F.3d 1136, 1155, 1157-58 (9th Cir. 2019) (allegations of conspiracy to restrict output of

customers in each group are more valuable to the other group"")."
918,84," Cf. id. at ¶ 8. PLS alleges that its platform benefits buyers by offering them an opportunity to learn about properties that were 
not widely marketed. This allegation, however, does not explain how buyers are otherwise benefited by off-MLS listings. 
According to PLS's allegations, PLS effectively offers buyers the same basic benefit as an MLS (an opportunity to learn about 
properties on the market), but without the other efficiencies that are created by increased information and competition (mostly 
through information sharing on an MLS), as explained above. Indeed, one of the most important market efficiencies created by 
an MLS ""is manifested in the reduction of the obstacles brokers must face in adjusting supply to demand: market imperfections 
are overcome in that information and communication barriers are reduced, along with the easing of the built-in geographical 
barrier confronting the buyer-seller relationship. Moreover, a realistic price structure is engendered."" Arthur D. Austin, Real 
Estate Boards and Multiple Listing Systems as Restraints of Trade, 70 COLUM. L. REV. 1325, 1329 (1970), cited with approval

918,87," The office exclusive exception is significant. PLS alleges that the presence of large brokerages operating across the nation 
increased demand for a nationwide listing network. See id. at ¶¶ 46, 48, & 49. Surely, then, marketing a private listing within a "
919,," large nationwide brokerage under the office exclusive exception provides significant exposure of the property in an off-MLS 
setting. This is important in evaluating whether the Clear Cooperation Policy has the plausible effect of reducing output of 
services to consumers. It does not."

the NAR-affiliated MLSs were obligated to adopt the Clear Cooperation Policy is sufficient to plead concerted action, as 
explained above. Thus, the question with respect to Bright MLS and Cal Regional MLS is whether they were competitors with 
each other, and competitors with PLS in a national market. The Court would find that this is a question of fact not suitable for 
resolution on a motion to dismiss. See Newcal Indus., Inc. v. Ikon Office Solution, 513 F.3d 1038, 1044-45 (9th Cir. 2015)."

925,1," Plaintiffs object to reliance on this testimony, arguing that it would be inadmissible at trial because it was in response to leading 
questions. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(2). Objections to the form of the questions were not stated on the record at the deposition, 
and are therefore waived. See Oberlin v. Marlin Am. Corp., 596 F.2d 1322, 1328 (7th Cir. 1979) (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 
32(d)(3)(B)). Regardless, the Court disagrees that this objection would render the testimony inadmissible under Fed. R. Evid. 
611. "
935,1," The following overview of the facts is drawn from PSD's Complaint, ECF No. 1, which the Court assumes true in analyzing 
Defendants' Motion to Dismiss. Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94, 127 S. Ct. 2197, 167 L. Ed. 2d 1081 (2007). The Court is 
not making factual findings. "
942,1," On November 20, 2020, the Honorable Robert N. Scola referred all pretrial matters to the undersigned Magistrate Judge for 
disposition. [D.E. 102]. "
944,2," Counts six and seven seek declaratory judgments for non-infringement as to two patents that Carnival presents in its own 
complaint against DeCurtis. Carnival states that DeCurtis can assert these claims because, although there was no subject 
matter jurisdiction when DeCurtis filed its complaint, they can be included as counterclaims to Carnival's complaint. As such, 
Carnival does not move to dismiss either counts six or seven because doing so would have no practical effect. "
951,3," Carnival presented additional arguments in support of the dismissal of the Disney prior art allegations, but there is no need to 
consider them because it is entirely unclear what Carnival failed to disclose."
951,4," Carnival presented many other arguments with respect to the deficiencies of the Disney prior art allegations, but there is no 
need to consider all of them given the errors already identified. "
952,5," Carnival presented additional arguments in support of the motion to dismiss allegations of the electronic lock system but we 
need not reach for the reasons already stated. "
953,6," In the same vein, Carnival suggests that any technical error can be corrected and that this shows a lack of materially. This 
again misses the point because the issue is not whether the patents can be corrected, but whether the Patent Office would have 
rejected the applications if it had known of a material omission. "
954,7," There is an argument to be made that Egenera actually supports DeCurtis's position, at least to some extent, because it 
rejected a proposed interpretation that narrowed the meaning of ""error"" to a definition that excluded intentional inaccuracy. Id. at 
1377 (""Cisco argues that Congress's removal of this language was meant to harmonize 'error' with what Cisco views as its plain 
meaning—one that excludes intentional inaccuracy. . . . [W]e now reject Cisco's proposed interpretation because it is contrary to 
the text of § 256, the structure of the AIA,4 and the AIA's legislative history. We hold that the AIA did not narrow the meaning of 
'error.'"")."
954,8," This is not an exhaustive list of all the ways in which Mr. DeCurtis contributed to Carnival's patents. We only include the 
allegations above to show that Carnival's argument lacks merit. "
955,9," Carnival asserts that the underlying motive for excluding Mr. DeCurtis is implausible because a contractual assignment exists 
for his patent rights. [D.E. 105 at 13]. This is unpersuasive because — even if Carnival had the right to assign Mr. DeCurtis's 
rights — that does not undermine the motive for failing to disclose him. After all, the facts might show that Carnival was 
concerned about something that Mr. DeCurtis would have disclosed if he had been included in the patent applications. Whatever 
the reason, this is a question that cannot be answered at this stage of the case and needs to be revisited at a later date. "
956,10," Of course, ""a patentee, acting in good faith on its belief as to the nature and scope of its rights, is fully permitted to press those 
rights 'even though he may misconceive what those rights are.'"" Id.(quoting Kaplan v. Helenhart Novelty Corp., 182 F.2d 311, 
314 (2d Cir. 1950))."
956,11," The doctrine also extends to acts reasonably attendant to litigation, including demand letters. See Atico Intern. USA, Inc., 
2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 73540, 2009 WL 2589148, at *2 (citing McGuire Oil Co. v. Mapco, Inc., 958 F.2d 1552, 1560 (11th Cir. 
1992) (holding that threatening litigation is a protected, prelitigation activity)). "
959,12," DeCurtis mentioned the fraud exception in its response, but dropped the ball at the goal line in support of its application. [D.E. 
99 at 21 (""As shown in the prior section, DeCurtis has successfully alleged fraud. Accordingly, neither Noerr-Pennington 
immunity nor ""patent privilege"" provide a basis for dismissal of DeCurtis's antitrust and tort claims."")]. Carnival fared worse; it 
omitted any discussion of the fraud exception."
959,13," Walker Process concerned antitrust liability under the federal Sherman Act. 382 U.S. at 173. The Supreme Court has, since 
Walker Process, reserved the question of ""whether and, if so, to what extent Noerr permits the imposition of antitrust liability for a 
litigant's fraud or other misrepresentations."" Professional Real Estate Investors, 508 U.S. at 61 n.6, (citing Walker Process, 382 
U.S. at 176-77). Neither party suggests that, in light of Professional Real Estate Investors that Walker Process is not an 
available exception to Noerr-Pennington. So, we proceed on the assumption that the exception exists."
959,14," Although Carnival focused heavily on the Noerr-Pennington doctrine and failed, in some respects, to explain the application of 
the patent privilege, we do not find that the latter applies anyway. That is, the patent privilege cannot apply if there are 
allegations of bad faith. See Hunter Douglas, 153 F.3d at 1336 (stating that ""federal patent law bars the imposition of liability for 
publicizing a patent in the marketplace unless the plaintiff can show that the patentholder acted in bad faith.""). That exception 
applies here because the FAC presents allegations that Carnival committed fraud on the patent office. See, e.g., Zenith Elec. 
Corp., 182 F.3d at 1354 (""Obviously, if the patentee knows that the patent is invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed, yet 
represents to the marketplace that a competitor is infringing the patent, a clear case of bad faith representation is made out.""). In 
other words, if the allegations of fraud on the Patent Office are true, it is unclear how that would fall short of bad faith. "
960,15," The FAC alleges two product markets: (1) a market for guest engagement systems and (2) a market for cruise ship travel with 
guest engagement systems. "
963,16," Although unaddressed in the briefs, we assume that the rule of reason applies to the facts of this case. Under this rule, the fact 
finder weighs all of the circumstances of a case in deciding whether a restrictive practice should be prohibited as imposing an 
unreasonable restraint on competition. Per se rules of illegality are appropriate only when they relate to conduct that is 
manifestly anticompetitive. See Bus. Elecs. Corp. v. Sharp Elecs. Corp., 485 U.S. 717, 723 (1988) (noting that ""per se rules are 
appropriate only for conduct that is manifestly anticompetitive, that is, conduct that would always or almost always tend to restrict 
competition and decrease output"") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). "
985,1," Forest and Mylan ultimately settled for a generic-entry date in January 2015, with a six-month extension of that date if Forest 
successfully obtained a six-month extension to its '703 Patent. Since Forest successfully obtained the extension, the final date of 
generic entry was pushed back six months to July 2015. "
995,2," Each day of therapy for Namenda IR consists of two doses, as Namenda IR was a twice-daily prescription. In contrast, each 
day of therapy for Namenda XR is only one dose, as it was a once-daily prescription. "
1001,3," In this case, as in Asacol, this issue arises in connection with the predominance inquiry, rather than the ascertainability inquiry, 
though it obviously pertains to both. "
1003,4," Vogt obtained his actual-world prices from IQVIA, a health care data company which provides market data that tracks 
prescriptions sold measured in dollars and units. More specifically, the numbers were obtained from National Sales Perspectives 
data and National Prescription Audit data, which each project ""100% coverage of the retail and non-retail channels for national "
1004,," pharmaceutical sales."" (Vogt Report at ¶ 80). These sources were the same as those used by Dr. Lamb for his antitrust injury 
analysis. "
1007,5," 1,659 entities filed claims for memantine, but not all of them were necessarily TPP class members. This is because some TPPs 
hire third-party administrators (""TPAs"") to file insurance claims on their behalf, and the TPA would be the entity that shows up in 
the OptumRx data, because it would be the one directly interacting with OptumRx. TPAs do not provide reimbursement and so 
do not qualify as class members. "
1009,6," SBA brings state, rather than federal, claims because ""Under the United States Supreme Court's decision in Illinois Brick Co. v. 
Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 745-46, 97 S. Ct. 2061, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1977), indirect purchasers of products sold at supra-competitive 
prices lack standing to sue under federal antitrust statutes"" but ""may still bring suit under state antitrust laws, if a state permits 
such claims."" Namenda VI, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 220574, 2018 WL 7197233, at *1. "
1017,1," In reviewing a motion to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2), a court may look to evidence outside the pleadings. See 
Sandoval v. Abaco Club on Winding Bay, 507 F. Supp. 2d 312, 315 (S.D.N.Y. 2007)."

1017,4, Amazon is domiciled in the State of Washington. 
1019,5," See Fiore v. McDonald's Corp., No. 96 Civ. 0376, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12354, 1996 WL 331090, at *7 (E.D.N.Y. June 12, 
1996) (""The only relevant market the plaintiffs have alleged in their complaint is the resale market for McDonald's franchised 
restaurants. Plaintiffs have failed to sufficiently allege a relevant market that is required to make out a claim under Section Two 
of the Sherman Act.""). "
1020,6," The one case which Real Selling raises to suggest that monopolization claims may succeed where the plaintiff alleged a single-
product market — a 55-year-old patent case - is entirely inapposite. That case involved a question of whether a manufacturer's 
enforcement of an invalid patent could provide the basis for an attempted monopolization counterclaim. The counterclaimant 
was not trying to resell the first manufacturer's own product but was instead trying to produce its own version. See Walker 
Process Equip., Inc. v. Food Mach. & Chem. Corp., 382 U.S. 172, 86 S. Ct. 347, 15 L. Ed. 2d 247 (1965). The anticompetitive 
harm of asserting an invalid patent to stifle production of alternatives in the market has clear antitrust implications whereas here, 
the reselling of a single brand's product does not."
1020,7," Real Selling asks for an additional opportunity to amend the complaint if the Court were to find its antitrust claims deficient. 
There is no reason to allow it to do so here because Real Selling's theory of the case simply does not raise antitrust concerns 
and additional factfinding would not rectify the defect in its pleadings. See Todd v. Exxon Corp., 275 F.3d 191, 200 (2d Cir. 
2001) (""Cases in which dismissal on the pleadings is appropriate frequently involve either (1) failed attempts to limit a product 
market to a single brand, franchise, institution, or comparable entity that competes with potential substitutes or (2) failure even to 
attempt a plausible explanation as to why a market should be limited in a particular way.""). "
1021,8," Real Selling also argues that because its claims arise from ESN's anticompetitive conduct, its sales in New York are in fact 
""inextricably tie[d]"" to Real Selling's claims. ECF No. 28 at 4. The logic of the theory isn't readily apparent but appears to be that 
because ESN's conduct was driven by a desire to remove Real Selling from competition in New York, its sales in New York 
would directly benefit from its actions, thus providing the requisite nexus between ESN's New York business activities and Real 
Selling's claims. For the reasons stated above, Real Selling does not allege cognizable anticompetitive conduct. In any event, 
Real Selling provides no support for this theory of personal jurisdiction in the case law, and likewise fails to explain why ESN's 
business in New York would benefit in particular by removing Real Selling from competition. Both companies, after all, sell their "
1022,," products online and are thus able to reach a national audience without regard for geography. Real Selling's theory, if accepted, 
would extend personal jurisdiction over any defendant facing claims of anticompetitive conduct where both defendant and 
plaintiff conduct any business, however minor, in New York. That clearly is not the law."
1022,9," Real Selling makes a last-ditch effort to seek jurisdictional discovery if the Court does not accept its arguments. ECF No. 24 at 
8. However, it has been on notice of ESN's pending motion to dismiss since at least May 14, 2020 (ECF No. 12) and the time to 
raise discovery demands would have been early in the six months between that notice and its response to the motion, including 
at two conferences that the Court held concerning the motion. In fact, confronting ESN's motion to dismiss for lack of personal 
jurisdiction, Real Selling proposed to amend its complaint, but rather than amending to allege sufficient contacts between ESN 
and the forum state, Real Selling instead merely changed its legal theory of the case, offering virtually no additional factual 
allegations to support jurisdiction. Real Selling simply does not get a second bite at the apple. In any event, the Court is 
somewhat puzzled by Real Selling's repeated interest in amending its pleadings at some considerable expense rather than 
simply refile its case in a court having appropriate jurisdiction. "
1025,1," Quotations referring to the ""No-Poach Agreement"" or the ""challenged conduct"" have been altered to say ""No-Poach Provision."" "
1029,2," This wage increase reflects the fact that Conrad was promoted from in-shopper to manager. (Ordover Report at 12). The 
[TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] is per-hour, and the [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] is per-shift. (Id.)."
1029,3," At any rate, Dr. Ordover asserts that the WSRs fail to track ""important aspects of compensation that are allegedly affected by 
the No-Poach Provision,"" such as tips for drivers and bonuses for managers, ""mak[ing] it difficult (if not impossible) to determine 
whether the No-Poach Provision reduced total compensation for many putative class members."" (Ordover Report at 43-45). "
1031,4," Dr. McCrary similarly concludes that ""[f]ranchisee testimony corroborates that starting wages are set competitively"" with other 
QSRs. (See McCrary Report at 52). "
1032,5," Dr. McCrary agrees. (See McCrary Report at 54) (""The monopsonist makes higher profit per unit of labor but they hire fewer 
workers (reduce labor demand) and restrict output in the process.""). "
1041,6," Dr. Ordover raises a similar argument about Dr. Singer's fixed effect for ""the local area minimum wage"": ""[W]hile Dr. Singer 
uses a variety of fixed effects in different regression specifications, the fact that the relationship between the wage rates and the 
minimum wage varies in his job category-specific regressions indicates that use of such fixed effects does not solve this flaw."" 
(Ordover Report at 43-44 n.84). "
1043,7," To the plaintiffs argument that Dr. Ordover made ""another basic mistake"" by ""not control[ing] for county-level economic 
conditions"" (Pls.' Reply in Support of Mot. to Exclude at 4): ""[T]he exclusion of major variables or in the inclusion of improper 
variables may diminish the probative value of a regression model. But such defects do not generally preclude admissibility, and 
courts allow use of a regression model as long as it includes the variables accounting for the major factors."" In re Urethane 
Antitrust Litig., 768 F.3d 1245, 1260-61 (10th Cir. 2014) (citing Bazemore v. Friday, 478 U.S. 385, 400, 106 S. Ct. 3000, 92 L. 
Ed. 2d 315 (1986)). "
1044,8," Dr. McCrary agrees, also finding that 60 percent of employees leave within 90 days. (McCrary Report at 52) (""Jimmy John's 
labor force has a very high turnover rate. High turnover means that even if . . . the [No-Poach Provision was] non-discretionary, 
[it was] unlikely to have had any effect on the many proposed class members who did not stay at Jimmy John's long enough to 
seek to move between stores.""). "
1045,9," Although the question of Dr. Singer's wage-structure model is moot, the Court is wary that, without defining a relevant market, 
the model's baseline premise hinges on ""the ipse dixit of the expert."" See GE v. Joiner, 522 U.S. 136, 146, 118 S. Ct. 512, 139 
L. Ed. 2d 508 (1997). "
1061,1," The pending motions relate to the claims brought by the four plaintiffs in 14 Civ. 3116 (""First Level Purchasers"" or ""FLPs"") and 
the four plaintiffs bringing individual actions against various defendants: (1) Agfa Corporation and AGFA Graphics, NV (together, 
""Agfa""), 14 Civ. 211; (2) Mag Instrument Inc. (""Mag""), 14 Civ. 217; (3) Eastman Kodak Company (""Kodak""), 14 Civ. 6849; and (4) 
Fujifilm Manufacturing U.S.A., Inc. (""Fujifilm,"" and together with Agfa, Mag, and Kodak, the ""Individual Purchasers"" or ""IPs""), 15 
Civ. 8307."
1061,2," ""The term 'primary aluminum' is used in the industry to describe aluminum in the form produced at a smelter or primary 
aluminum plant, by original producers, as distinguished from 'secondary aluminum,' which is reconstituted aluminum scrap."" 
Eastman Kodak Co. v. Henry Bath LLC, 936 F.3d 86, 88 (2d Cir. 2019) (""Aluminum VI""). "
1062,3," The Court assumes familiarity with the facts and lengthy procedural history of this litigation. See, e.g., In re Aluminum 
Warehousing Antitrust Litig., No. 13 MD 2481 (KBF), 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 121435, 2014 WL 4277510 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 29, 
2014) (""Aluminum I""); In re Aluminum Warehousing Antitrust Litig., 95 F. Supp. 3d 419 (S.D.N.Y. 2015) (""Aluminum II""); In re 
Aluminum Warehousing Antitrust Litig., 833 F.3d 151 (2d Cir. 2016) (""Aluminum III""); Aluminum VI, 936 F.3d 86; In re Aluminum 
Warehousing Antitrust Litig., 336 F.R.D. 5 (S.D.N.Y. 2020) (""Aluminum VII""). The Court's account of the facts here draws mainly 
from the parties' submissions in connection with the pending motion for summary judgment. The Court has considered the 
following submissions by defendants in support of their motion: defendants' Local Rule 56.1 statement, Dkt. 1291 (""Def. 56.1""); 
the declaration of John S. Playforth, Esq., Dkt. 1290 (""Playforth Decl.""), and exhibits thereto; and defendants' reply to plaintiffs' 
counter-statement to defendants' Local Rule 56.1 statement, Dkt. 1305 (""Def. Reply 56.1""). The Court has also considered the 
following submissions by plaintiffs in opposition to the motion: plaintiffs' counter-statement to defendants' Local Rule 56.1 
statement, Dkt. 1300 (""Pl. 56.1""); the declaration of Patrick J. Coughlin, Esq., Dkt. 1298 (""Coughlin Decl.""), and exhibits thereto, 
in support of the FLPs' opposition; and the declaration of Derek Y. Brandt, Esq., Dkt. 1301 (""Brandt Decl.""), and exhibits thereto, 
in support of the IPs' opposition. To the extent cited by the parties in their summary judgment papers, the Court also considers 
the evidence submitted in connection with the FLPs' motion for class certification. In addition, solely to provide context and 
without accepting those allegations as true, the Court draws on allegations in the Third Amended Complaint, Dkt. 738 (""TAC""), 
the consolidated complaint of the Individual Purchasers, Dkt. 745 (""JAC""), and Fujifilm's separate amended complaint, 15 Civ. 
8307, Dkt. 35 (""Fujifilm Compl.""). Citations to a party's 56.1 statement incorporate the evidentiary materials cited therein. When facts stated in a party's 56.1 
statement are supported by testimonial, video, or documentary evidence and not denied by the other party, or denied by a party 
without citation to conflicting admissible evidence, the Court finds such facts to be true. See S.D.N.Y. Local Civil Rule 56.1(c) 
(""Each numbered paragraph in the statement of material facts set forth in the statement required to be served by the moving 
party will be deemed to be admitted for purposes of the motion unless specifically controverted by a correspondingly numbered 
paragraph in statement required to be served by the opposing party.""); id. Rule 56.1(d) (""Each statement by the movant or 
opponent . . . controverting any statement of material fact[] must be followed by citation to evidence which would be admissible, 
set forth as required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).""). "

1065,7," Defendants dispute that their warrant cancellations were coordinated, see Def. Reply 56.1 ¶ 69, that lengthened queues 
caused the overall price of aluminum to rise, id. ¶¶ 73-74, and that they intended to and did inflate the MWP, id. ¶¶ 81-83. They 
admit that their warrant cancellations could have caused queues to lengthen, all else equal, but maintain that ""canceling 
warrants,"" and the particular decisions that caused the largest queue increases, ""made unilateral economic sense"" under the 
circumstances. Id. ¶ 75; see id. ¶¶ 76-80. They also admit that lengthened queues ""in some circumstances could increase the 
portion of all-in aluminum prices attributable to a regional premium by depressing the LME cash price relative to the all-in price,"" 
but dispute that queues inflate the all-in prices for aluminum. Id. ¶ 81. Because it is ""useful to distinguish the question of whether 
an antitrust violation occurred from whether plaintiffs have standing to pursue it,"" the Court, for purposes of the present motion, 
resolves these disputes in plaintiffs' favor, ""assum[ing] the alleged violation and assess[ing] only plaintiffs' standing to pursue 
their claim."" Daniel v. Am. Bd. of Emergency Med., 428 F.3d 408, 437 (2d Cir. 2005); see Def. 56.1 ¶ 83 (confirming that ""merits 
issues have no relevance to Plaintiffs' efficient enforcer standing""). "
1066,8," As the parties have sequentially numbered their exhibits, the Court refers to each only by number. For the sake of clarity, 
exhibits 1-74 refer to the exhibits attached to the Playforth Declaration; exhibits 75-145 refer to the exhibits attached to the 
Coughlin Declaration; and exhibits IP1—IP28 refer to the exhibits attached to the Brandt Declaration. "
1067,9," See, e.g., Ex. 8 at 2-3 (Alcoa quoted to Ampal ""a fixed (Hedge) price for"" deliveries ""instead of the MidWest Transaction Price 
for December average""); Ex. 15 (Claridge contract with smelter charging dollar amount per pound without reference to MWTP or 
MWP); Ex. 19 at 2 (contract between Custom and Noble for three months' of deliveries at fixed price each month, without 
reference to MWP or MWTP). Defendants state that Extruded also entered into such contracts, but the agreements cited include 
a ""firm MWTP"" in each, representing ""ingot plus [] billet conversion"" (though not referring to the MWP itself), covering several 
months' worth of deliveries. See, e.g., Ex. 24-26."
1067,10," See Ex. 2 (""Def. Ramsey Tr."") at 6-7 (Ampal Rule 30(b)(6) witness describing ""verbal,"" or ""phantom contract""); Ex. 4 (""Def. 
Dillett Tr."") at 159 (Custom Rule 30(b)(6) witness explaining ""[a] spot purchase would not have a contract; therefore, the pricing 
is not fixed to us""); Def. 56.1 ¶ 19 (describing Claridge spot purchases)."
1067,11," See, e.g., Ex. IP16 at 5 (four-year supply agreement between Kodak and Alcoa which included two pricing methodologies, 
between which Kodak could choose, and defining one, ""Fixed Forward Price,"" as the LME ""plus contango,"" and the other, 
""Month Prior Pricing,"" as the Platt's reported average, while including price adjustment if MWP falls outside certain range during 
contract term); Ex. 48 (""Def. Zecchini Tr."") at 96 (Mag 30(b)(6) witness agreeing that fixed-forward contract ""locks in the all-in 
price""). But see Ex. 45 at 1 (Kodak contract with Alcoa fixing ""firm metal price"" but also noting that such price ""will be the 
Midwest US Transaction price and fixed forward for each purchase order"")."
1067,12," Defendants also note that the IPs' contracts often included European regional premiums, not the MWP. See Def. 56.1 ¶¶ 37, 
41, 45-46, 51. Plaintiffs argue that this fact is immaterial given that the defendants have not otherwise discussed the relevance 
of such premiums or based their motion on their import. See Pl. 56.1 ¶¶ 37, 41. On this point, the Court agrees with plaintiffs, 
and does not view the existence of contracts including European regional premiums as material to the pending motion."
1067,13," See also, e.g., Ex. 94 (""Pl. Hall Tr."") at 67 (Extruded Rule 30(b)(6) witness confirming that all its purchases included the 
MWP); Ex. IP28 (""Pl. Zecchini Tr."") at 123 (Mag Rule 30(b)(6) witness testifying that, for ""forward buys,"" ""the aluminum cost is 
based on the LME, Midwest conversion cost""). "
1068,14," See, e.g., Pl. Ramsey Tr. at 37 (Ampal stated that spot-purchase price ""would always be the same, metals weight transaction 
price, plus the premium, depending on the delivery method""); id. at 47 (spot purchases ""would always be based on an LME plus 
the Midwest""); Ex. 93 (""Pl. Dillett Tr."") at 157 (""components of the spot price"" were ""the current LME for the day, the current 
Midwest premium for the day, and the conversion charge to make that into billet""). Although not material to the pending motion, 
plaintiffs' testimony suggests an odd circularity in aluminum pricing. The MWTP, as reported by Platts, purports to reflect actual 
prices paid in spot-market transactions; but each such transaction, according to plaintiffs, invariably reflects the MWTP."
1068,15," Ex. 8 at 3; See, e.g., Def. Ramsey Tr. at 71 (fixed contracts were ""a way that [Ampal] would hedge""); Ex. 10 (Ampal ""hedged"" 
agreement with Alcoa providing a ""fixed, firm price""); Ex. 3 (""Def. Hardcastle Tr."") at 16 (Claridge Rule 30(b)(6) witness 
described ""forward bias"" contracts as ""contracts or transactions whose intent was to hedge the price of aluminum for Claridge""); 
Ex. 30 (""Starfinger Tr."") at 212-13 (Kodak Rule 30(b)(6) witness agreeing that, under fixed-price contract, ""during that period, if . . 
. the Midwest Premium rose, that would not have affected Kodak's purchase price""); id. at 215 (""Q. So there are some cases in 
which Kodak is able to enter into aluminum purchase agreements that fix the premium? A. Yes.""); Pl. 56.1 ¶ 52 (agreeing that 
""Mag's forward contracts generally provide stability of the all-in price for aluminum of which the Midwest Premium is only one 
part"")."
1068,16," See, e.g., Pl. 56.1 ¶¶ 14, 18, 25 (""[O]nly the LME price could be hedged.""), 47 (Kodak could ""fix the LME price portion of the 
aluminum expense.""), 52 (""Mag would agree to a fixed all-in price for future prices of aluminum with its suppliers"" when they 
allowed it.)."
1068,17," See Pl. 56.1 ¶¶ 18, 25, 47; Ex. IP14 (""Martin Tr."") at 151 (""Q. Was there ever a contract in which Kodak fixed-forward the 
premium, a regional premium as well? A. No.""); Ex. IP8 (""Walde Tr."") at 164 (Q. ""Did the proposal also contemplate [Fujifilm] 
fixing a regional premium? A. No, the only thing that was fixed was the LME portion."")."
1068,18," See, e.g., Pl. 56.1 ¶¶ 15 (describing negotiations ""as to shape, purity, location, cash payment, and delivery method""), 20 
(same), 26 (noting successful negotiations over ""conversion rate""). "
1069,19," See also, e.g., Ex. 92 (""Pl. Hardcastle Tr."") at 85-86 (""[Claridge] tried, but . . . there was very little negotiation"" as to 
""[f]abrication and length premiums,"" and no negotiations on the MWP); Pl. Hall Tr. at 287 (Extruded could negotiate over the 
""direct sale price, the fabrication price, whatever you want to call it for the billet conversion and/or toll. Those are the numbers 
that we negotiate. The prior month Midwest average as, again, stated earlier, we have no control over.""); Ex. IP1 (""Pellegroms 
Tr."") at 136 (Agfa Rule 30(b)(6) witness testified that ""[t]here are two elements that we can negotiate. That is the conversion 
costs and transport costs.""); id. at 41-42 (""[O]ur aluminum suppliers could not do anything about the premium pricing"" or ""for the 
metal price part. . . . They are not allowed to sell us aluminum without the premium.""); Walde Tr. at 112-13 (""The regional 
premiums were always fixed . . . once it was settled, the original discussion . . . . We negotiated conversion fees, and that is 
really it.""). "
1070,20," The Court found that the FLPs had satisfied the first three elements of Rule 23(a) (numerosity, commonality, and typicality), 
see Aluminum VII, 336 F.R.D. at 37-39, and declined to address the disputed fourth element (adequacy of representation), in 
light of its holding that the FLPs failed to show predominance under Rule 23(b)(3), id. at 43. "
1071,21," On December 16, 2020, the Second Circuit denied the FLPs' petition. See Dkt. 1317."
1071,22," Defendants previewed that the anticipated motion would be a ""short and narrow,"" ""surgical motion,"" implicating few factual 
disputes. See Ex. 86 (""Conf. Tr."") at 12 (identifying factual issues as ""who purchased from whom"" and whether any plaintiff could 
""negotiate the price it [] paid its smelters""). Accordingly, the Court did not require the parties to submit a joint statement of 
stipulated facts, but rather ""encourage[d] but [did] not require some degree of consultation"" among them over potentially 
disputed facts. Id. at 20. In their Local Rule 56.1 counter-statement, plaintiffs fault defendants for, ostensibly, departing from their 
representations about the extent of factual disputes, and for relying on disputed facts without having first consulted plaintiffs. Pl. 
56.1 at n.1. By and large, the Court finds defendants' representations to have been accurate and the material factual disputes 
presented to be discrete. "
1072,23," Ampal is the sole exception because, unlike the other plaintiffs at issue, it bought roughly 2,200 metric tons of primary 
aluminum from Glencore and Century (an alleged Glencore affiliate) during the conspiracy period."
1072,24," The parties disagree at length about whether plaintiffs' claims are aptly characterized as ""umbrella"" claims. See Pl. Opp'n at 
27-31; Def. Reply at 6-10. But the umbrella metaphor that some cases and commentators have used in this area does not carry 
legal significance. As have many other courts in this Circuit, see infra note 25, the Court finds the term to be descriptively useful, 
in that it captures the situation, present here, in which ""a cartel controls only part of a market, but a consumer who dealt with a 
non-cartel member alleges that he sustained injury by virtue of the cartel's raising of prices in the market as a whole."" Gelboim, 
823 F.3d at 778. But a determination of standing in an individual antitrust case is highly fact-specific. Associated General 
Contractors, Inc. v. California State Council of Carpenters (""AGC""), 459 U.S. 519, 536-37, 103 S. Ct. 897, 74 L. Ed. 2d 723 
(1983) [**48] . The use of the umbrella label does not predetermine how the efficient-enforcer factors apply in any particular 
case, or tacitly impose an inflexible ""privity"" requirement for there to be antitrust-standing inquiry. Cf. Pl. Opp'n at 28-29. "
1074,25," See also, e.g., Sonterra v. Barclays, 366 F. Supp. 3d at 533 (noting Gelboim's concern with ""umbrella standing"" involving ""a 
plaintiff injured by dealing with a non-defendant by virtue of a defendant's raising of prices in the market as a whole""); Silver II, 
332 F. Supp. 3d at 905 (""Plaintiffs who do not deal directly with the defendants are referred to as 'umbrella purchasers' or 
'umbrella plaintiffs.'""); 7 W. 57th St. Realty Co. v. Citigroup, Inc., 314 F. Supp. 3d 497, 512 (S.D.N.Y. 2018) (""umbrella 
purchasers"" are ""plaintiffs who did not deal directly with"" defendants (quoting Gelboim, 823 F.3d at 778)), aff'd, 771 F. App'x 498 
(2d Cir. 2019) (summary order); Sonterra Capital Master Fund Ltd. v. Credit Suisse Grp. AG (""Sonterra v. Credit Suisse""), 277 F. 
Supp. 3d 521, 559 (S.D.N.Y. 2017) (""Plaintiffs who purchased products from non-defendants but allege that defendants' actions 
raised their prices are called 'umbrella purchasers.'"" (quoting LIBOR VI, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 175929, 2016 WL 7378980, at 
*15)); In re Platinum & Palladium Antitrust Litig. (""Platinum I""), No. 14 Civ. 9391 (GHW), 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46624, 2017 WL 
1169626, at *21 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 28, 2017) (""Plaintiffs who do not have direct dealings with the defendants, but purchased 
products allegedly affected by defendants' price fixing, are referred to as 'umbrella purchasers.'""); Sullivan, 2017 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 25756, 2017 WL 685570, at *15 (rejecting ""'umbrella'-type damages claims"" where ""plaintiffs had no direct dealings with 
the defendants""); LIBOR VI, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 175929, 2016 WL 7378980, at *15 (""Plaintiffs who purchased products from 
non-defendants but allege that defendants' actions raised their prices are called 'umbrella purchasers.'""). "
1075,26," Plaintiffs discount Gelboim's concern with ""damages disproportionate to wrongdoing"" as ""dicta"" and a mere ""prudential 
concern, not a statutory concern, that should not bear on standing under Lexmark."" Pl. Opp'n at 23-24. But the Second Circuit's 
guidance to this effect, which post-dated Lexmark by two years, was considered. And this factor rationally bears on whether the 
plaintiffs here, as opposed to a party more proximate to wrongdoers, are efficient prosecutors of a section 1 claim. Following 
Gelboim's lead, courts assessing whether a plaintiff is an efficient enforcer have accordingly considered whether the plaintiff's 
suit could exact outsized damages from the alleged-malefactor defendant. See, e.g., LIBOR VI, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 175929, 
2016 WL 7378980, at *15; Platinum II, 449 F. Supp. 3d at 308-11. This Court is guided by this persuasive authority. In all events, 
although the possibility of outsized damages reinforces the Court's holding that the indirect-purchaser plaintiffs here are not 
efficient enforcers, it is not dispositive. The Court would reach the same result absent that consideration, based on the 
considerable lacuna between defendants' allegedly collusive actions and the pricing harm allegedly worked on plaintiffs. "
1077,27," In a 2018 decision in the same case, see infra, Judge Caproni dismissed an amended complaint on several grounds, including 
that plaintiffs who transacted only with non-conspiring defendants were not efficient enforcers. Silver II, 332 F. Supp. 3d at 905. 
In support, she cited the overwhelming majority of decisions that had held similarly in benchmark-manipulation cases, identifying 
FOREX as the only ""exception to this rule."" Id. at 905 n.13. "
1081,28," Plaintiffs maintain that all primary-aluminum sales required the payment of the MWP, even where contract documents failed 
expressly to reference it. See, e.g., Pl. 56.1 ¶ 58; id. ¶ 59 (dismissing as ""irrelevant"" whether contracts include ""MWP or MWTP 
on the face of the contract for sale . . . because on all first-level purchases of aluminum, the MWP is paid""). But that claim, too, 
diverges from the allegations that the Court accepted as true at the pleading stage. See Aluminum II, 95 F. Supp. 3d at 444 
(crediting allegations that contracts ""contain provisions tying the contract prices to the Midwest Premium"" and that ""it is not 
possible to negotiate"" contracts that do not do so); see also TAC ¶¶ 166, 176; JAC ¶¶ 32, 44; Fujifilm Compl. ¶ 28 (aluminum 
contracts ""expressly incorporate the benchmark regional premiums""). "
1082,29," On the contrary, defendants made clear that, although the efficient-enforcer question was not at issue on appeal, they 
intended to pursue that issue in the district court if the Second Circuit reversed on antitrust injury. See Joint Br. of Defendants-
Appellees at 37 n.11, Aluminum VI, 936 F.3d 86 (No. 16-4230) (""Although these appeals do not present the question of whether 
Plaintiffs are 'efficient enforcers' of the antitrust laws, Defendants would expect to show that Plaintiffs do not satisfy that 
requirement in any further proceedings in the District Court."")."
1082,30," The one case plaintiffs cite, Glendora v. Cablevision Sys. Corp., 893 F. Supp. 264, 266 (S.D.N.Y. 1995), is inapposite. There, 
in reversing the summary dismissal of a pro se plaintiff's claims, the Circuit directed the district court to consider an issue—
whether a statute provided an implied cause of action—that it had previously disregarded. The district court took the Circuit's sua 
sponte action, and specific instruction, to connote that it agreed there was such a cause of action. Id. Even so, the district court 
did not treat the Circuit as having already decided the question, but instead undertook its own independent analysis, id. at 267-
71, as this Court proceeds to do here. "
1083,31," As portrayed by defendants, this chain entailed, in sequence: (1) defendants' acts lengthening warehouse queues; (2) the 
longer queues causing third-party spot-market participants to enter into transactions for the delivery of physical primary 
aluminum at higher prices, even though such transactions often did not involve LME-warehoused aluminum; (3) those 
participants reporting such transactions to Platts, which incorporated them into its tabulation of the MWP; (4) longer queues not 
reducing the LME settlement price in an offsetting manner; and (5) the inflated MWP causing plaintiffs to pay a higher all-in 
aluminum price because their counter-parties, i.e., smelters and industrial producers, charged the MWP without any adjustment 
or offsets to account for its inflation. See Def. Mem. at 6, 15. "
1084,32," Plaintiffs now assert, without citations to evidence and for the first time in this litigation, that the absence of the MWP in those 
contracts ""is a function of internal accounting at Alcoa, not reflective of transactions where the MWP was not paid."" Pl. 56.1 ¶ 58. 
Absent supporting admissible evidence, the Court does not credit that statement. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). "
1085,33," In practice, given this longstanding litigation, the likelihood that new plaintiffs—who bought directly from smelters, but not 
defendants—will come forward with claims appears low. That said, with the Court having recently denied the FLPs' motion for 
class certification, such claims may yet be timely for entities that purchased directly from smelters and which were included 
within the FLPs' proposed class. See Am. Pipe & Constr. Co. v. Utah, 414 U.S. 538, 552, 94 S. Ct. 756, 38 L. Ed. 2d 713 (1974). 
In any event, the Second Circuit has held that such ""external or practical considerations"" are ""not substantially material"" in 
assessing the efficient-enforcer factors. IQ Dental Supply, Inc. v. Henry Schein, Inc., 924 F.3d 57, 67 (2d Cir. 2019). That inquiry 
is concerned with the ""overall scheme of antitrust enforcement""; therefore, ""[t]he existence of other plaintiffs who could lay claim 
to precisely the same damages, whether in theory or in actuality, indicates that the would-be antitrust plaintiff might not be well 
positioned to vindicate the antitrust laws for the benefit of the public."" Id. (emphasis added). "
1086,34," Plaintiffs note that a conspiracy formed with the ""purpose and with the effect of raising, depressing, fixing, pegging, or 
stabilizing the price of a commodity . . . is illegal per se."" Pl. Opp'n at 28 (quoting Aluminum VI, 936 F.3d at 95-96). Judge 
Forrest stated early in this litigation, however, that it is ""highly likely"" that plaintiffs' claims are subject to a ""rule of reason,"" not 
per se, analysis. Aluminum II, 95 F. Supp. 3d at 448-49. Regardless, even if defendants' manipulation of warehouse queues with 
the goal of driving up the MWP were treated as an instance of per se illegal price fixing, that would not answer the efficient-
enforcer question at issue here. See, e.g., Daniel, 428 F.3d at 437 (allegation of per se violation ""does not absolve [plaintiffs] of 
the obligation to demonstrate [antitrust] standing"")."
1086,35," Loeb Industries, Inc. v. Sumitomo Corp., 306 F.3d 469, 483 n.4 (7th Cir. 2002), which plaintiffs cite, does not counsel a 
different result. Loeb did not decide the umbrella-standing issue, which it left ""open for further exploration at the district court 
level."" Id. And Loeb's dicta suggesting that plaintiffs should have antitrust standing to sue defendants with whom they did not 
transact but who ""rigg[ed] product standards"" is inapposite. Id. The MWP is not a product standard, and plaintiffs accuse 
defendants of indirectly influencing, not ""rigging,"" the premium. And Loeb is factually afield. In Loeb, the contracts at issue were 
""directly and explicitly based on the"" manipulated benchmark, whereas here, in many instances, that was not so. Id. at 488; see 
id. at 489 (""It is this contractual linkage, absent in Reading, that prevents other market variables from"" complicating the causal 
analysis). "
1087,36," Plaintiffs identify certain large-scale sales of aluminum by defendants, Pl. 56.1 ¶ 84, but do not specify whether those included 
the MWP, Def. Reply 56.1 ¶ 84 (many sales identified by plaintiffs did not involve MWP). Defendants also counter that plaintiffs 
misleadingly present defendants' aluminum holdings as sales figures, and skew data so as to suggest greater sales by 
defendants (e.g., citing global versus domestic sales and profit figures). Id.; Def. Reply at 17-18."
1087,37," Plaintiffs, curiously, argue that claims by direct purchasers—apparently including Ampal, Reynolds, and Southwire—against 
defendants could be barred by Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 730, 97 S. Ct. 2061, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1977), and thus 
that plaintiffs are the only viable enforcers here. That is because, they argue, those purchases were ""secondary"" in the sense 
that defendants had first bought aluminum from a smelter, and paid the MWP, before selling it to those customers at a price 
including the then-inflated MWP. See Pl. Opp'n at 20. Plaintiffs thus suggest that the holding in Illinois Brick—that those who 
were harmed through ""pass-on"" price increases generally cannot recover antitrust damages, see Ill. Brick, 431 U.S. at 734-35—
might limit direct-purchaser plaintiffs' ability to recover on purchases from the antitrust violators themselves. Plaintiffs do not cite 
any authority for that proposition. And defendants appear to concede that Illinois Brick does not bar the claims asserted by 
Ampal, Reynolds, or Southwire. See Def. Reply at 15 (plaintiffs' argument under Illinois Brick ""get[s] it backwards""); Arg. Tr. at 80 
(""We never said that . . . the direct purchasers were barred by Illinois Brick, and any such statement in my view would be 
completely erroneous.""). In any event, the Supreme Court has recently underscored that such a claim would be available: ""[W]e "
1088,," have consistently stated that 'the immediate buyers from the alleged antitrust violator' may maintain a suit against the antitrust 
violators."" Apple Inc. v. Pepper, 139 S. Ct. 1514, 1520, 203 L. Ed. 2d 802 (2019) (emphasis added) (quoting Kansas v. UtiliCorp. 
United Inc., 497 U.S. 199, 207, 110 S. Ct. 2807, 111 L. Ed. 2d 169 (1990)). "
1089,38," Plaintiffs' expert at the class-certification stage has already characterized such cancellations as ""difficult to model"" given the 
""occasional and lumpy"" nature of warrant cancellations. Aluminum VII, 336 F.R.D. at 52, 56 (quoting report of Dr. Christopher L. 
Gilbert). That ""lumpiness"" severely undermines plaintiffs' unsupported claim that ""Defendants' manipulation of the MWP . . . was 
sustained and universal."" Pl. Opp'n at 21-22."
1089,39," Plaintiffs contend that defendants' acknowledgment of disagreement on this point defeats their argument because, at 
summary judgment, such disputes ""must be resolved in favor of Plaintiffs."" PL. 56.1 ¶ 57. That broad principle, of course, is true. 
But the material issue under the third efficient-enforcer factor is the presence of speculation and, hence, uncertainty. Thus, even 
at the more forgiving pleading stage, courts have found this factor to favor dismissal in benchmark-manipulation cases. See, 
e.g., Silver II, 332 F. Supp. 3d at 911; Platinum I, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46624, 2017 WL 1169626, at *24-25; Sullivan, 2017 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25756, 2017 WL 685570, at *18-19. And here, there is no genuine dispute that the relationship between longer 
queues and the all-in prices paid by customers is complex and debatable. See Pl. Opp'n at 18 (characterizing dispute as ""a hotly 
contested factual matter""). Compare, e.g., Ex. 55 at 2 (""[T]he impact of premium inflation is not to increase the [all-in] price but 
rather to cause the LME price to trade at a discount to the exogenously-set [all-in] price.""), Ex. 63 at 6 (Alcoa stating that ""it is not 
the case that long queues have resulted in higher overall metal prices,"" and that ""the total price for delivered aluminum continues 
to be well below the pre-financial crisis levels""), and Ex. 64 (Rusal stating that it ""agrees with the LME's analysis that any rise in 
aluminum premiums would lead to a corresponding fall in the exchange price""), with Vazquez Decl. at 2 (contending that ""the 
LME price does not inherently move inversely to the MW Premium,"" owing to independent inputs into each), id. at 3-9. But see 
Pl. Opp'n at 6 (showing MWP rising and LME price falling between 2010 and 2014); Ex. 76 (""Supp. Zona Rpt."") ¶ 9 (concluding 
only that changes in the MWP were ""not fully offset by any changes in the LME Price,"" not that the LME did not decline in 
response to longer queues (emphasis added)). "
1096,1," The challenge to TSI's declaratory relief claim is not separately addressed in any detail here. The allegations in the antitrust 
and declaratory relief claims overlap; and a decision about the viability of the antitrust claim may bear on the Court's evaluation 
of the various prudential factors relevant to the decision whether to adjudicate the declaratory relief claim. Under these 
circumstances, the Court will dismiss the declaratory relief claim, allowing TSI to amend this claim as well in an attempt to 
provide an overall cohesive and well-pleaded complaint."
1096,2," Though broadly defining the market, the only products identified in the 4AC are three TP-Link routers. (4AC ¶¶ 6, 40-44, 47.) "
1097,3," At the hearing, counsel for TP-Link conceded that TSI could plausibly define the product market as wireless router products 
and economic substitutes that perform the function of connecting users to the Internet. Unlike the definition in the 4AC, this one 
narrows the scope of the product by explaining its function. This serves not only to better describe the product but also to identify 
potential substitutes. It is unclear whether TSI's proposed definition (Opp. at 5 n.2) differs from the concededly proper definition. "
1101,1," Cellustar opposed DISH's Motion to Dismiss at Docket Number 131 and Sprint's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings at 
Docket Number 139. "
1102,2," In the Amended Complaint, Cellustar refers to both Sprint and PR Wireless simply as ""Sprint,"" making it impossible to 
distinguish which allegations are made against Sprint, which are made against PR Wireless and which are made against both. "
1103,3," Though not apparent in the Amended Complaint, Cellustar clarified in its Opposition to DISH's Motion to Dismiss that its claims 
under the Sherman Act are raised only against Sprint, not against DISH. See Docket No. 131, pg. 3."
1103,4," The only other type of price-fixing that is condemned per se is vertical minimum resale price-fixing, a narrow exception not 
alleged here. See Augusta News Co. v. Hudson News Co., 269 F.3d 41, 47 (1st Cir. 2001). "
1120,1," JELD-WEN made two specific changes to its reimbursement policy. First, it stopped reflexively satisfying Steves's 
reimbursement requests, instead scrutinizing them closely to ensure that a refund was warranted. And second, it stopped "
1121,," reimbursing Steves for the cost of doors that couldn't be sold because of defective doorskins, instead refunding only the cost of 
the doorskin. "
1122,2," Where a case involves legal and equitable claims that share common factual issues, the Seventh Amendment requires a jury 
trial on the legal claims first, with the jury's factual findings binding the court as to the equitable claims. See Dairy Queen, Inc. v. 
Wood, 369 U.S. 469, 479, 82 S. Ct. 894, 8 L. Ed. 2d 44 (1962). "
1123,3," The court didn't reduce the antitrust award by $2.2 million, as it had done with the contractual-damages award, because 
sufficient evidence supported the jury's finding that JELD-WEN wouldn't have tightened its reimbursement policies absent the 
merger. "
1124,4," These conduct remedies included: requiring JELD-WEN to transfer the equipment and intellectual property used at Towanda to 
its buyer; enabling the buyer to retain Towanda's current employees; ordering the buyer to offer Steves an eight-year supply 
agreement at prices based on the current Supply Agreement; allowing other Independents to terminate their supply agreements 
with JELD-WEN without penalty; and permitting JELD-WEN to purchase as many doorskins as it needed from the divested entity 
for two years before capping the number that JELD-WEN could buy annually thereafter. "
1125,5," The court also granted most of the conduct remedies that Steves requested. JELDWEN's briefs don't address the propriety of 
these remedies. "
1126,6," Pre-cure occurs when the surface of a doorskin isn't consolidated with the rest of the skin before the doorskin is cured (i.e., air-
dried). This may lead the surface to separate from the rest of the doorskin, causing problems in the finished door."
1126,7," HN8[
] As its name implies, a ""combination"" trade secret consists of ""a combination of characteristics and components, each 
of which, by itself, is in the public domain, but the unified process, design, and operation of which, in unique combination, affords 
a competitive advantage and is a protectable secret."" AirFacts, Inc. v. de Amezaga, 909 F.3d 84, 96 (4th Cir. 2018) (cleaned up). "
1127,8," If we were to find that Steves has yet to suffer an antitrust injury, we would vacate the jury's past-damages award, but not the 
district court's divestiture order. This is because the divestiture order is premised on a threatened injury: Steves's potential loss 
of access to doorskins in September 2021, which would drive it out of business. Such a loss would undoubtedly be an antitrust 
injury, as ""competitors suffer antitrust injury when they are forced from the market by exclusionary conduct"" like a refusal to sell. 
See Viamedia, Inc. v. Comcast Co., 951 F.3d 429, 482 (7th Cir. 2020). "
1128,9," The Supply Agreement was designed to protect that ability by allowing Steves to do three things: purchase up to 20% of its 
doorskins from other suppliers for any reason; buy any amount from other suppliers if they beat JELD-WEN's pricing by at least 
3%; and terminate the contract immediately once JELD-WEN gave notice of termination. "
1130,10," Indeed, the opinions in Concord Boat Corp. don't use the term ""antitrust impact"" or suggest that it's a standing requirement, as 
JELD-WEN asserts. Rather, they discuss whether the defendant's conduct was anticompetitive and whether the plaintiffs' 
expert's testimony about his pricing comparison was properly admitted at trial. See Concord Boat Corp., 207 F.3d at 1055-57; 
Concord Boat Corp., 21 F. Supp. 2d at 925-28, 934. "
1132,11," To arrive at the 3% figure, we assume that Masonite (who had 46% market share in 2012) and JELD-WEN (who had 38%) 
would capture equal amounts of the market share that CMI lost. Based on that assumption, if CMI's share had dropped from 
16% to 3%, then Masonite and JELD-WEN would have each captured an additional 6.5%, giving them 52.5% and 44.5%, 
respectively. 52.52 + 44.52 + 32 = 4,745.50, which is about 250 points less than the doorskin market's current Index. Under that 
same assumption, if CMI's share had dropped to 2%, the market's Index would've been 4,838 (within about 160 points of its 
current score). So, to prove the weakened-competitor defense, JELD-WEN had to show that CMI's market share would have 
fallen to between 2% and 3%."
1132,12," The district court, of course, was considering a different economic climate than the one we face now in light of COVID-19. 
Throughout this opinion, we review the district court's analysis based on the facts that were before it, without considering how 
the housing market has changed in the meantime. "
1133,13," HN21[
] If there is a presumptive deadline for Clayton Act injunctive claims, it's four years after the challenged action, 
tracking that statute's limitations period for damages claims. See, e.g., Oliver, 751 F.3d at 1085-86. This is because, in applying 
laches, courts of equity ""usually act or refuse to act in analogy to[] the statute of limitations relating to actions at law of like 
character."" See King v. Richardson, 136 F.2d 849, 862 (4th Cir. 1943) (cleaned up). And here, Steves filed suit less than four 
years after the merger closed. "
1135,14," The district court's award of future damages as an alternative—which we vacate for unrelated reasons, as explained below—
doesn't undercut its irreparable-harm finding. As the district court recognized, while a damages award would be better than no 
relief at all, it wouldn't fully repair Steves's injury because it wouldn't keep Steves in business. "
1140,15," As we conclude that Steves's future-lost-profits claim wasn't ripe, we need not address JELD-WEN's alternative argument that 
the damages award didn't account for benefits that Steves gained from the CMI merger. "
1146,1," Unimania, Inc. is a software development subsidiary of BrandTotal Ltd."
1146,2," The parties have consented to the jurisdiction of the undersigned magistrate judge for all purposes pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 
636(c)."
1146,3," This case concerns only the Facebook and Instagram social networks. References herein to Facebook's products or social 
networks therefore refer to those two networks, and not to any other networks or products that Facebook, Inc. offers. "
1147,4," Facebook voluntarily dismissed its state court action before bringing the present action in this Court, one day before BrandTotal 
had intended to seek a TRO in state court. "
1148,5," BrandTotal's Answer and Counterclaim is filed as a single docket entry. Citations herein to the ""Counterclaim"" refer to 
paragraphs in the portion of that document so captioned, which begins on page 14. "
1149,6," Facebook, Inc. v. Brandtotal Ltd., No. 20-cv-07182-JCS, 499 F. Supp. 3d 720, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 210431, 2020 WL 
6562349 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 9, 2020). Citations herein to the Court's previous order refer to page numbers of the version filed in the 
Court's ECF docket. "
1150,7," BrandTotal also notes that in opposing the previous motion for a TRO, Facebook did not challenge BrandTotal's allegations of 
intent. Opp'n at 7-8. BrandTotal does not argue, however, that failure to raise such an argument in that separate context has any 
legal consequence for Facebook's ability to do so here. "
1152,8," To briefly address one of Facebook's arguments, Facebook contends that BrandTotal cannot proceed on this claim because 
Facebook did not know that Google would comply with the request to remove UpVoice. See Reply at 4-5. Facebook's argument 
suggests that a business acting with that effort, may escape liability so long as it was not certain of success at the outset. 
Facebook cites no case endorsing such a broad loophole in the doctrine of tortious interference. The California Supreme Court 
decision on which both parties rely instead makes clear that knowledge of a substantially certain outcome may serve as an 
alternative to showing specific intent; it is not an additional requirement. See Korea Supply Co. v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 29 
Cal. 4th 1134, 1154, 131 Cal. Rptr. 2d 29, 63 P.3d 937 (2003). The Court does not reach the question of whether BrandTotal's 
current allegations sufficiently allege either substantial certainty or specific intent to interfere with a contract. "
1153,9," The FTC's order is subject to judicial notice as a matter of public record. Facebook has also invoked section VII.E.1.d of that 
order, which requires Facebook to ""[e]nforc[e] against any Covered Third Party violations of [Facebook's] Platform Terms based 
solely on the severity, nature, and impact of the violation; the Covered Third Party's malicious conduct or history of violations; 
and applicable law."" Request for Judicial Notice Ex. 3 at 9, § VII.E.1.d. That provision may also be relevant to the merits of 
BrandTotal's claims, but its significance is somewhat less clear than VII.E.1.b's requirement that Facebook deny access to third 
parties that have not certified compliance."
1153,10," See [*28]  S. Or. Barter Fair v. Jackson County, 372 F.3d 1128, 1136 (9th Cir. 2004) (discussing a court's discretion to 
reconsider issues addressed on a motion for preliminary injunctive relief). "
1155,11," The Court concluded in that order that BrandTotal had ""shown at most serious issues going to this claim, not a likelihood of 
success."" Order Denying TRO at 28 (emphasis added). BrandTotal cites that decision, implying that it recognized some degree 
of merit to the claim. See Opp'n at 15-16. To the contrary, having recognized serious issues going to other claims, the Court 
considered BrandTotal's UCL fraud claim only to determine whether it made any stronger showing of likelihood of success, and 
determined that it did not."
1155,12," The Court takes no position at this time on whether some other declaratory relief counterclaim based on any new version of 
BrandTotal's product can be stated. Such a claim is not contained in the current pleadings, and the Court will address any such 
claim if it is added in any amended counterclaims. "
1161,1," Rather than re-hashing the complicated regulatory background and factual basis of this case, I incorporate by reference the 
history set forth in my prior decision certifying a class for both the DPPs and EPPs, In re Suboxone, 421 F. Supp. 3d 12 (E.D. 
Pa. 2019), aff'd, 967 F.3d 264 (3d Cir. 2020), as well as my ruling on Reckitt's Motion to Dismiss the States' action. In re 
Suboxone, No. 13-md-2445, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 145501, 2017 WL 3967911 (E.D. Pa. Sept. 8, 2017)"
1161,2," Reckitt is currently known as Indivior, Inc. In December 2014, Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals, Inc. was demerged from its 
prior parent, the Reckitt Benckiser Group PLC, into Indivior PLC. Although Indivior is technically the named defendant in this 
case, the pleadings and many of the relevant exhibits use the name ""Reckitt."""
1161,3," MonoSol is currently known as Aquestive Therapeutics, Inc. (""Aquestive""). Although Aquestive is technically the named 
defendant, the pleadings and many of the relevant exhibits use the name ""MonoSol."" For clarity's sake, I will therefore refer to 
Aquestive as ""MonoSol."" "
1164,4," Reckitt identifies several different experts who allegedly engaged in such contradictions: (1) damages experts Dr. Berndt and 
Dr. Lamb opined that the price increases on Suboxone tablets relative to Suboxone film drove greater conversion to Suboxone 
film; (2) Dr. Westreich, a medical doctor, opined that affordability can be an important consideration in medication choice; (3) Ms. 
Tso, a managed care expert, asserted that insurance formulary decision can make certain products economically inaccessible to 
many patients; and (4) Dr. Emch, an economist, claimed that Reckitt achieved entrenchment of Suboxone film by raising prices 
of tablets relative to film and giving payors incentive to favor film over tablets in their formularies. "
1168,5," Dr. Lamb's rebuttal report addressed efforts by Reckitt's expert, Dr. Normann, to establish that the increase on brand Suboxone 
tablets was not ""economically irrational."" (Reckitt's Mot., Ex. 2, Lamb Rebuttal Rep. ¶¶ 78-84.) "
1169,6," Dr. Lamb was retained by the Direct Purchaser class to calculate the aggregate amount of overcharge damages suffered by 
class members. Dr. Conti was retained by the End Payor class to measure overcharges to class members. Dr. Berndt was 
retained by the State Plaintiffs to conduct a disgorgement analysis to calculate the financial state Defendants would have found 
themselves in had they not engaged in the alleged scheme. Reckitt posits that neither the End Payor class nor the States have retained Professor Zettler or Ms. Jaskot, and thus have no 
expert testimony to support the but-for timeline. Reckitt, however, has not cited any case law to establish that Dr. Conti and Dr. 
Berndt cannot rely on expert testimony proffered by the other Plaintiffs. "
1171,7," Reckitt indiscriminately cites multiple antitrust cases for the proposition that the relevant product market at a supplier or 
middleman level of distribution will often have different contours from the market at a consumer level, and a product market is 
properly pled only if defined from the perspective of the plaintiff. These cases are legally and factually distinguishable and, in 
fact, often advocate for a broader definition of the relevant market See, e.g., Physician Specialty Pharm., LLC v. Prime 
Therapeutics, LLC, No. 18-1044, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 159853, 2019 WL 5149866, at *6 (D. Minn. Aug. 8, 2019) (finding, in a 
claims alleging a vertical restraint of trade by a pharmacy benefit manager who refused to fill claims by a pharmacy, the relevant 
market included all potential customers of the pharmacy regardless of what type of insurance or payment the customer used); 
Little Rock Cardiology Clinic PA v. Baptist Health, 591 F.3d 591, 596-97 (8th Cir. 2009) (in antitrust claim by cardiology clinic and 
its physicians against nonprofit hospital operator and insurance company alleging vertical restraint of trade, the relevant product 
market should include all consumers of cardiology services regardless of how they pay for them). "
1174,8," (See also MonSol's Mot., Ex. 5, Ernst Berndt Dep. Part II (""Berndt Dep. II""), 476:20-24 (""[B]ecause I'm not a lawyer or an 
antitrust expert, and so there may be some principles I'm not aware of that are standard practice there.""); MonoSol's Mot., Ex. 6, 
Ernst Berndt Dep. Part III (""Berndt Dep. III""), 735:2-3 (""I don't market myself as an antitrust economist."")"
1174,9," MonoSol relies heavily on the case of O'Brien v. Sofamor, No. 96-8015, 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4070, 1999 WL 239414, at *1 
(E.D. Pa. Mar. 30, 1999). In that case, plaintiffs sued a manufacturer of spinal implants for injuries resulting from the implantation 
of faulty bone screws. In support of their claims, the plaintiffs submitted the report of Dr. Bennett, a board-certified neurologist. 
1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4070, [WL] at *3. The court found that Dr. Bennett was not qualified as he had never performed surgery of 
any type, had no training or education in instrumented spinal fusion surgery, had never treated a patient who had undergone 
one, disclaimed any expertise in biomechanics, metallurgy, or the design of orthopedic implants, and admitted that he did not 
know what types of instrumentation were available to surgeons performing fusion surgery. 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4070, [WL] at 
*4. In addition, he had not performed any independent research in either the area of spinal fusion surgery or a related area. Id. 
The court found that plaintiff have provided no evidence that Dr. Bennett had the expertise to opine on what caused the plaintiff's 
worsened condition after spinal surgery and, thus, did not meet the liberal standard for qualification. Id. Aside from demonstrating the well-established principle that an expert must be qualified to opine on the particular area on which 
he or she speaks, this case seems to have no bearing on whether Dr. Berndt, a health care economist, is qualified to opine on 
the market impact of certain conduct in the health economics arena. "
1175,10," See also In re Polypropylene Carpet Antitrust Litig., 93 F. Supp. 2d 1348, 1359 (N.D. Ga. Mar. 28, 2000) (finding expert in 
econometrics and application of statistical methods to business and economic issues qualified to testify on competitive prices 
and damages in an antitrust case even though he disclaimed expertise in the area of economics or market behavior)."
1175,11," The deposition testimony at issue is as follows: Q. And the business relationship included MonoSol providing [Reckitt] with its film technology and manufacturing the 
Suboxone film strips; is that right? A. Yes. Q. And so you would describe that, wouldn't you, as a vertical business relationship? A. I'm not sure it's only vertical because there was a [*63]  lot of collaboration that was involved in jointly developing, so it 
had many horizontal aspects to it as well. Q. So MonoSol was acting as a company producing substitutes for the branded drugs that Reckitt was producing; is that 
your testimony? . . . A. My testimony is that MonoSol collaborated with Reckitt in jointly developing and putting together an FDA application to 
market a product that was not going to be AB-substituted to Reckitt's brand. (Berndt Dep. 45:3-23.)"
1175,12," Indeed, MonoSol has not demonstrated that Dr. Berndt's testimony is completely unfounded on economic principles, 
particularly given the intricacies of characterizing relationships as horizontal or vertical. More recent jurisprudence has eschewed 
such strict distinctions and has recognized that vertical relationships can give rise to horizontal conspiracies. See United States 
v. Apple, Inc., 791 F.3d 290, 324-25 (2d Cir. 2015) (holding that vertical agreements can be used to facilitate coordination of a 
horizontal conspiracy). "
1178,13," In support of its argument, MonoSol cites Apotex v. Cephalon, Inc., 321 F.R.D. 220 (E.D. Pa. 2017). In that case, the court 
agreed with the defendants that one of the key underlying assumptions of the expert's damages calculation was unsupported by 
the record. Id. at 235-36. Here, by contrast, the validity of Plaintiffs States' allegations regarding an anticompetitive conspiracy 
between MonoSol and Reckitt has not been proven or disproven. "
1186,1, All statutory references are to the Revised Statutes of Missouri (2012).
1186,2," Ports Petroleum Co., Inc. of Ohio v. Nixon, 37 S.W.3d 237, 241 (Mo. banc 2001). "
1190,3," This language is also found in another Chapter 416 law, Missouri's Unfair Milk Sales Practices Act, at § 416.455, which allows 
""[a]ny person who is injured in business or property"" to bring a private action for violations of that Act which prohibits selling milk 
below cost. § 416.415. "
1191,4," The opinion notes that after Dr. Batchu opened an office in Rolla, Missouri, which was beyond the 75 mile limit of the non-
compete clause, Duvall continued treating with him there though he complained about the additional transportation costs and 
delays. Id. at 823-4. "
1193,5," ""(2) ""Cost"", is the sum of: (a) a. If the motor fuel is not purchased from an affiliate, the lowest invoice cost that the seller charged to the purchaser for motor 
fuel of like grade and quality within three days prior to the date of any alleged unlawful resale by the purchaser, less trade 
discounts, allowances or rebates which the purchaser receives on the particular invoice or transfer; or b. If motor fuel is 
purchased or received from an affiliate, the lowest transfer price that the affiliate charged to the purchaser or receiver for motor 
fuel of like grade and quality within three days prior to the date of any alleged unlawful resale by the purchaser or receiver, less 
trade discounts, allowances, or rebates which the purchaser receives on the particular invoice or transfer; plus (b) The cost of doing business; plus (c) Freight charges and all applicable federal, state and local taxes not already included in the invoice cost or transfer price;"""
1193,6," HN11[
] Under § 416.620.3, it is not a violation of the MFMA to sell below cost ""to meet the equally low price of a competitor."" "
1194,7, § 416.625
1194,8," This misconstruction of Nixon bled into the verdict director with its inclusion of the erroneous statement purportedly derived 
from Nixon that being '""injured in his business or property' means being forced to sell below cost."" Again, such a statement is not 
supported by Nixon and is not found there since Nixon did not consider the § 416.635 private cause of action where the phrase 
""injured in his business or property"" is found. See Martin v. Fulton Iron Works Co., 640 S.W.2d 491, 495 (Mo. App. E.D. 1982) 
(HN13[
] ""[A] respondent may attack the erroneous rulings of the trial court for the purpose of sustaining a judgment in its 
favor.""). Furthermore, this misstatement in the verdict director is irrelevant to submissibility which is the basis of Midwest's point 
of error, not instructional error. Wieland v. Owner-Operator Services, Inc., 540 S.W.3d 845, 858 n.4 (Mo. banc 2018). Finally, 
Midwest has not demonstrated any prejudice here because it proffered the verdict director and continues to claim on this appeal 
that it is correct. Burns v. Elk River Ambulance, Inc., 55 S.W.3d 466, 476 (Mo. App. S.D. 2001) (HN14[
] ""[T]he giving of an 
alleged erroneous instruction is not grounds for reversal unless the appealing party was prejudiced thereby.""); see also, Lay v. P 
& G Health Care, Inc., 37 S.W.3d 310, 329-30 (Mo. App. W.D. 2000). "
1199,9," Midwest's fourth point violates Rule 84.04(d)'s prohibition on multifarious points but we will exercise our discretion to review the 
multiple claims of error raised in this point. AB Realty One, LLC v. Miken Techs., Inc., 466 S.W.3d 722, 729 n.4 (Mo. App. E.D. 
2015). "
1216,1," Indeed, AFC has stipulated to the fact that Purugganan will be deprived of these profits if it closes on the franchises at issue 
throughout this litigation. (See, e.g., ECF No. 66-6 at 4.) "
1217,2," Purugganan acknowledges that ""Doctors Express' principal place of business was in the State of Maryland."" (Compl. ¶ 43.) "
1218,3," The Connecticut Appellate Court in Alpha Beta Capital Partners applied New York law in analyzing the scope of the settlement 
agreement's choice of law provision. See 193 Conn. App. at 424-25. The scope of the MDA's choice of law provision must 
likewise be interpreted under the MDA's governing law—i.e., the law of Maryland. HN9[
] As noted in a case cited by AFC, 
""Maryland follows the objective law of contract interpretation and construction,"" and will give effect to the ""ordinary, plain 
meaning"" of words ""read in the context of the choice of law provision."" Tomran, Inc. v. Passano, 391 Md. 1, 13-14, 891 A.2d 336 
(Md. 2006). The parties do not dispute the breadth of the MDA's choice of law provision, and there can be no question that the 
plain meaning of the phrase ""this Agreement and all claims arising from the relationship between us and you"" would extend to 
Purugganan's CUTPA claim based on AFC's alleged unfair and deceptive practices in infringing on Purugganan's rights under 
the MDA to develop his territory. "
1219,4," Purugganan alleges that at the time he executed the MDA he also ""signed a Franchise Agreement with Doctors Express 
wherein he purchased the rights to a specified territory, site to be determined, to open and operate an urgent care center."" 
(Compl. ¶ 12; see also Compl. Ex. B, ECF No. 1-3.) AFC acknowledges ""that the MDA does require that a master developer 
also be a franchisee, but that franchisor-franchisee relationship is governed by a separate agreement."" (AFC Reply at 6 n.3.) 
Because Purugganan's CFA claim is predicated on AFC's alleged unlawful termination of his master developer rights under the 
MDA and the denial of the commissions and fees he earns thereunder, and not on his rights under the separate franchise 
agreement, the Court confines its analysis to whether Purugganan has plausibly alleged that he is a franchisee under the MDA. "
1221,5," HN13[
] ""To satisfy antitrust standing at the pleading stage a plaintiff must plausibly allege two things: (1) that it suffered a 
'special kind of antitrust injury,' and (2) that it is a suitable plaintiff to pursue the alleged antitrust violations and thus is an 
'efficient enforcer' of the antitrust laws."" IQ Dental Supply, Inc. v. Henry Schein, Inc., 924 F.3d 57, 62 (2d Cir. 2019) (quoting Gatt 
Commc'ns Inc. v. PMC Assocs., L.L.C., 711 F.3d 68, 76 (2d Cir. 2013) (internal quotation marks omitted). HN14[
] The Second 
Circuit has ""established a three-part test for determining whether the plaintiff has alleged an antitrust injury: (1) the court must 
identify the practice complained of and the reasons such a practice is or might be anticompetitive[;] (2) the court must identify the 
actual injury the plaintiff alleges . . . which requires [it] to look to the ways in which the plaintiff claims it is in a worse position as a 
consequence of the defendant's conduct[;] and (3) the court compares the anticompetitive effect of the specific practice at issue 
to the actual injury the plaintiff alleges."" Id. at 62-63 (internal quotation marks, citations, and alterations omitted). As to the 
second requirement, ""[a] four-factor test is employed to determine whether an antitrust plaintiff is an efficient enforcer,"" in which 
the Court ""must evaluate: (1) 'the directness or indirectness of the asserted injury,' (2) 'the existence of an identifiable class of 
persons whose self-interest would normally motivate them to vindicate the public interest in antitrust enforcement,' (3) 'the 
speculativeness of the alleged injury,' and (4) 'the difficulty of identifying damages and apportioning them among direct and 
indirect victims so as to avoid duplicative recoveries.'"" Id. at 65 (quoting Daniel v. Am. Bd. of Emergency Medicine, 428 F.3d 
408, 443 (2d Cir. 2006)). Purugganan does not attempt to defend his ability to establish antitrust standing in his opposition brief."
1221,6," This Court has previously observed that these opinion-based conclusory allegations are also illogical. Whether these franchises 
are owned by AFC or a franchisee, the centers will still be operating within the territory in competition with others, present and 
prospective, in the urgent case business. "
1222,7," HN18[
] In addition to the above cited deficiencies, AFC also correctly argues that Purugganan fails to allege a plausible conspiracy to restrain trade under Section 1 of the Sherman Act, which requires ""a combination or some form of concerted 
action between at least two legally distinct economic entities""—not ""[u]nilateral conduct on the part of a single person or 
enterprise."" Capital Imaging Assocs., 996 F.2d at 542. Nor does he allege ""1) the possession of monopoly power in the relevant 
market and 2) the willful acquisition or maintenance of that power as distinguished from growth or development as a 
consequence of a superior product, business acumen or historic accident,"" Merced Irrigation Dist. v. Barclays Bank PLC, 165 F. 
Supp. 3d 122, 140 (S.D.N.Y. 2016), on behalf of AFC so as to state a monopolization claim under Section 2. (quoting PepsiCo, 
Inc. v. Coca-Cola Co., 315 F.3d 101, 105 (2d Cir. 2002) (per curiam)). "
1224,8," HN28[
] As AFC notes, Maryland law also recognizes a separate cause of action for malicious use of process, which requires 
a plaintiff to establish, inter alia, ""that wrongful proceedings caused an arrest, a seizure of property, or other 'special injury.'"" One 
Thousand Fleet, 346 Md. at 44. ""The mere expense and annoyance of defending a civil action is not a sufficient special damage 
or injury to sustain an action for malicious prosecution."" Id. (quotation marks and citation omitted). For similar reasons, then, 
Purugganan fails to plead a cognizable claim for malicious use of process. "
1226,*, This disposition is not an opinion of the full Court and pursuant to I.O.P. 5.7 does not constitute binding precedent. 
1227,1," HN1[
] The relevant portions of New Jersey's antitrust act, which largely mirror the language of the Sherman Act, ""shall be construed in harmony with the ruling judicial interpretations of comparable [f]ederal antitrust statutes."" N.J. Stat. Ann. § 56:9-18 
(West 2020). See Ideal Dairy Farms, Inc. v. John Labatt, Ltd., 90 F.3d 737, 748 (3d Cir. 1996) (dismissal of New Jersey state 
antitrust claim proper after parallel federal antitrust claims failed)."
1227,2," The District Court exercised jurisdiction over the Sherman Act and Clayton Act claims under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1337, and over 
the state law claims under 28 U.S.C. § 1367(a). We exercise jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291. "
1229,3," BanxCorp also argues in conclusory fashion that the District Court ""erroneously considered each aspect of . . . Bankrate's 
conduct in isolation, rather than looking to Bankrate's conduct taken as a whole."" BanxCorp. Br. 31. But BanxCorp points to no 
example in support of this contention, simply labeling the District Court's analysis ""clear error."" Id. That BanxCorp disapproves 
the District Court's assessment of the sufficiency of its evidence to withstand summary judgment does not mean the District 
Court failed to consider the evidence as a whole or that BanxCorp's evidence was sufficient to prevent summary judgment in 
favor of Bankrate."
1229,4," BanxCorp also argues that Judge Cecchi erred by failing to recuse herself from this case based on her husband's employment 
as an attorney with a law firm that handles, among other things, antitrust matters. While at first blush these attacks on Judge 
Cecchi appear baseless and unwarranted, because the issues were not raised before the District Court (and no justification was 
offered for failing to do so), we decline to address them. See Barna v. Bd. of Sch. Dirs. of Panther Valley Sch. Dist., 877 F.3d 
136, 146 (3d Cir. 2017). "
1236,1," Defendants' Answer has a first set of numbered paragraphs (Answer at 1-15, ¶¶ 1-106) responding to the allegations in 
Capella's complaint and a second set of numbered paragraphs (Answer at 15-41, ¶¶ 1-83) pleading their affirmative defenses. 
As only the affirmative defenses are relevant to the Motion to Strike, all citations to the Answer are to the second set of 
paragraphs unless otherwise indicated."
1236,2," The case was initially filed in the Southern District of Florida and was later transferred to the Northern District of California. (Dkt.

1238,3," Both Predecessor Patents claim priority at the earliest to U.S. Provisional Application 60/277,217 filed on March 19, 2001. See 
U.S. Patent No. RE42,368; U.S. Patent No. RE42,678. The Smith patent has a filing date of September 20, 2001 but claims 
priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/324,683 filed on September 22, 2000 and U.S. Provisional Application No. 
60/267,285 filed on February 7, 2001."

no less binding than those issued by district courts). "
1239,5," The Court notes that Defendants will face a much higher evidentiary burden on both elements of scienter when the merits are 
eventually considered. At the pleading stage, however, a reasonable inference is sufficient. Exergen, 575 F.3d at 1328-29. "
1240,6," The Court is further persuaded by the sound reasoning in Judge Chen's treatment of this issue in 2014. See Capella Photonics, 
Inc. v. Cisco Sys., Inc., 77 F. Supp. 3d at 850. Although the pleadings in the California court were slightly different than those 
here and were offered by different parties, the Court sees no reason to reach a different result."
1240,7," It is not clear from Defendants' Answer whether Jason Eisenberg is the same person as Joshua Isenberg discussed supra, or if 
they are two patent prosecution attorneys for Capella with similar names. The Court uses these names consistently with 
Defendants' use in their Answer."
1240,8," Defendants also argue in their briefing that Mr. Eisenberg's statements were material to patentability. (See Dkt. No. 38 at 14). 
During oral arguments, Defendants explained that they rely on the exception rather than the but-for materiality standard. (See 
Transcript, Dkt. No. 98 at 67:3-23). As Defendants acknowledged, the relevant paragraphs of their Answer do not plead but-for 
materiality. (Id.; Answer ¶¶ 70-71). "
1247,1," Because there is no conflict as both states follow the objective theory of contract formation, the Court does not need to address 
whether the choice-of-law provision applies.. "
1249,2," The Court notes that the parties may elect to bring actions before a court in limited circumstances detailed in the My Best Buy® 
Terms: ""Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, either party may elect to bring an action (1) in small claims court on an individual 
basis if the amount in controversy is properly within the jurisdiction of an appropriate small claims court or (2) in a court of 
competent jurisdiction to seek to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights."" (Fletcher Decl., Ex. B. ¶ 11.) "
1255,1, Grandesign's other claims against Talon aren't subject to the present motion. 
1256,2," This summary of the relevant facts is drawn from Grandesign's Complaint and attached exhibits, which the Court assumes to 
be true on a motion to dismiss. "
1257,3," Although application of a contractual choice of law provision isn't automatic, Talon's burden of demonstrating that Delaware 
bears a substantial relationship to the parties is satisfied by the fact of Talon's incorporation there. Grandesign doesn't contend 
that application of Delaware law would conflict with a fundamental policy of California. See Nedlloyd Lines B.V. v. Superior 
Court, 3 Cal. 4th 459, 11 Cal. Rptr. 2d 330, 834 P.2d 1148 (1992) (in bank). "
1258,4," Grandesign acknowledges in its briefing that the Complaint's citation to Section 1125(a)(1) notwithstanding, it intends to state a 
claim under subsection (a)(1)(A) only, so the Court does not consider whether the Complaint states a claim under subsection 
(a)(1)(B). (Dkt. 30 at 5-6.) "
1259,5," The Court takes judicial notice, at Grandesign's request and without apparent opposition, that the Louisiana Secretary of 
State's records show that Lamar Advertising is a tradename of The Lamar Company, L.L.C., a Louisiana limited liability company 
with a Baton Rouge, Louisiana address. "
1274,1," Exhibits A, B, and C of the Berman Reply Declaration are copies of registration information from the U.S. Copyright Office's 
Online Catalog regarding the three albums. The Court takes judicial notice of these governmental records. See Fed. R. Evid.

1282,4," For any cause of action, not just the IIPEA claim, if prior paragraphs are intended to support that cause of action, then Morena 
should incorporate by reference only those specific paragraphs, e.g. ""paragraphs 14 through 17, 27, 38 and 42 are hereby 
incorporates by reference."" HN22[

345 F.Supp.3d at 1234 n.14. "
1284,5," YCH's motion did not argue that the IICR cause of action was not plausibly pled. However, the pleading deficiency identified in 
this section necessarily follows from the Court's analysis of the first cause of action. Because a failure to state a claim can be 
raised even at trial, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(2), and because the deficiency is fatal to part of the IICR cause of action, the Court 
addresses the matter sua sponte at this time. See Omar v. Sea Land Service, Inc., 813 F.2d 986, 991 (9th Cir. 1987)."
1284,6," YCH did not move to dismiss the second cause of action for copyright infringement based on the three albums' cover art. 
Therefore, the analysis in this section does not apply to issues surrounding the cover art."
1284,7," Again, in the absence of argument on the issue, the IICR claim will not be dismissed to the extent that it is related to ownership 
interests in the cover art. "
1286,8," Like the IICR claim, YCH's motion did not argue that the UCL cause of action was not plausibly pled. However, the pleading 
deficiency identified in this section necessarily follows from the Court's analysis of the first cause of action and the IICR claim. 
Because the deficiency is fatal to part of the UCL claim, the Court addresses the matter sua sponte at this time. See Omar, 813 
F.2d at 991."
1286,9," Because YCH does not address any issues surrounding the cover art, the analysis of this subsection is limited to actions 
involving the three albums. "
1290,10," Relatedly, while the submissions at this time suggest knowledge by Morena, the issue of knowledge has not been litigated or 
decided."
1290,11," To be clear, Morena is free to request a preliminary injunction under the Copyright Act either in its Prayer for Relief or as part 
of the allegations under a copyright infringement cause of action. "
1294,1," For purposes of this Memorandum and Order, the Court refers to docket entries in FWK, et al. v. Shire, et al., 16-cv-12653 as 
""FWK [ECF No.]"" and docket entries in Picone, et al. v. Shire, et al., 16-cv-12396 as ""Picone [ECF No.]."""
1294,2," On December 9, 2020, the Court approved the DPPs' settlement with Actavis. [FWK 551]. That settlement did not resolve any 
claims against Shire or the IPPs' claims against Actavis, though the IPPs informed the Court that they have reached a settlement 
with Actavis. [FWK 546]. Accordingly, Actavis will not be a party at trial."
1294,3," For the remainder of the Order, if an identical motion was filed on both dockets, the Court will refer only to the motion filed in 
FWK, et al. v. Shire, et al., 16-cv-12653. "
1304,4," Defendants' reliance on Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., [FWK 419-1 at 24; FWK 436-1 at 16], is misplaced. 
In that case, the Supreme Court evaluated the summary judgment standard in antitrust cases implicating § 1 of the Sherman 
Act. 475 U.S. 574, 576-77 (1986). In other words, the court was deciding the quantum of evidence an antitrust plaintiff must 
adduce to withstand a motion for summary judgment. Id. Here, the Court has already concluded that there is a genuine factual 
dispute as to the existence of the no-AG Agreement. What a plaintiff must do to advance to trial is a different question from what 
evidence a plaintiff may present at trial after having already survived a motion for summary judgment. "
1316,1, Wolstenholme also held the title of Northeast Regional Sales Manager. 
1317,2," ""John House"" is the sales representative for Dayton Superior."
1317,3," ""Doug"" is Doug Bartle, the White Cap representative who coordinated with Meadow Burke."
1317,4," ""PO"" is a ""purchase order"" from White Cap on another project that White Cap was putting on hold because of its concern about 
Meadow Burke's letting ACS sell the Meadow Burke product in Florida. "
1318,5, Meadow Burke was not named as a defendant. 
1319,6," ACS does not challenge the district court's denial of its motion for partial summary judgment. We would reach the same 
conclusions as the district court, that the motion is moot, in light of our conclusion that ACS has failed to demonstrate any 
genuine issue of material fact on its antitrust claims. "
1323,7," ACS argues that Meadow Burke contrived the engineering department concern as a post hoc and pretextual business reason 
for ACS's termination to protect White Cap. Whether or not ACS is correct on this point is of little moment given the other "
1324,," evidence and the fact that such evidence would not tend to exclude the possibility of independent action on the part of Meadow 
Burke and White Cap. "
1325,8," We concluded in Part II.A above that ACS failed to establish its allegation of the agreement or conspiracy between Meadow 
Burke and White Cap, and thus we concluded that ACS's § 1 claim fails. In Part II.B below, we note that ACS must prove some 
anticompetitive conduct to establish its § 2 claims, and we note that the only anticompetitive conduct that ACS asserts to satisfy 
that requirement is the same alleged agreement or conspiracy between Meadow Burke and White Cap. Thus, we conclude in 
Part II.B that ACS's § 2 claims fail for failure to establish the only anticompetitive conduct it asserts. In light of these conclusions, 
we need not address White Cap's suggestion that—even if such concerted action between Meadow Burke and White Cap were 
established—ACS's claims would nevertheless fail because a manufacturer is free to enter into an exclusive distributorship 
arrangement with a distributor, and because the antitrust law looks with favor on such exclusive arrangements, at least in the 
absence of substantial harm to competition. See Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law ¶ 1653c (4th ed. 2017); 
Electronics Communs. Corp. v. Toshiba Am. Consumer Prods., 129 F.3d 240, 245 (2d Cir. 1997); Paddock Publ'ns, Inc. v. Chi. 
Trib. Co., 103 F.3d 42, 44-47 (7th Cir. 1996); Rutman Wine Co. v. E. & J. Gallo Winery, 829 F.2d 729, 735 (9th Cir. 1987); H & B 
Equip. Co. v. Int'l Harvester Co., 577 F.2d 239, 245-46 (5th Cir. 1978); Packard Motor Car Co. v. Webster Motor Car Co., 243 
F.2d 418, 420, 100 U.S. App. D.C. 161 (D.C. Cir. 1957); see also McWane, Inc. v. F.T.C., 783 F.3d 814, 835 (11th Cir. 2015). "
1326,9," ACS argued that the district court ruled sua sponte, in violation of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(f), on the issue of specific 
intent to monopolize for ACS's attempted monopolization claim. We reject this argument because the district court's ruling was 
not sua sponte. Although White Cap's briefing to the district court focused only on the § 1 claim, the motion for summary 
judgment itself sought judgment on all of ACS's claims. In any event, given that all of ACS's antitrust claims relied upon the 
same alleged anticompetitive conduct, without the establishment of such conduct, ACS's attempt claim fails regardless of the 
intent element. Cf. Morris, 364 F.3d at 1293 n.10 (""[T]he elements of the two offenses [monopolization and attempt to 
monopolize] differ in only one material respect: attempt to monopolize requires specific intent to achieve monopoly power. 
Therefore, the attempt claim in this case is more difficult to maintain and prove. Because Morris does not withstand summary 
judgment on its monopolization claim, it cannot maintain its attempt claim."" (citation omitted))."
1326,10," Because we affirm the entry of summary judgment and dismissal of ACS's case, ACS's argument regarding reassignment is 
moot. Moreover, the argument is without merit."
1326,11," On October 29, 2020, ACS filed a motion for this Court to take judicial notice of a merger involving White Cap in October 2020. 
White Cap filed a response to this motion and simultaneously moved for sanctions against ACS. Because, as we explain, all of 
ACS's claims rely on the theory of anticompetitive conduct comprised of the alleged agreement between White Cap and 
Meadow Burke in 2016, and because ACS failed to prove such an agreement, we deny as moot ACS's motion for judicial notice. 
White Cap's motion for sanctions is also denied. "
1338,1," The court acknowledges that EQMD at least alludes to the argument that Noerr-Pennington does not apply. But its articulation 
of its position is somewhat muddled in that it appears to be arguing for a fraud exception instead. (ECF No. 42, PageID.1375-
79). Regardless, to the extent EQMD argues that Noerr-Pennington immunity should not be applied outside of the antitrust 
context, (ECF No. 42, PageID.1377-78), this argument fails. HN9[
] First, undeveloped arguments are deemed forfeited. See United States v. Fowler, 819 F.3d 298, 309 (6th Cir. 2016) (""Issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by 
some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived.""). Second, as to the merits, the Supreme Court itself has invoked 
Noerr-Pennington principles outside of antitrust. See NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co., 458 U.S. 886, 912-14, 102 S. Ct. 3409, 
73 L. Ed. 2d 1215 (1982) (noting the right to petition recognized in Noerr in holding that the plaintiff's boycott of white merchants 
was protected by the First Amendment); see also Bill Johnson's Restaurants, Inc. v. NLRB, 461 U.S. 731, 741-44, 103 S. Ct. 
2161, 76 L. Ed. 2d 277 (1983) (noting that in California Motor Transport, the Court had recognized ""the right of access to the 
courts"" as an aspect of the right to petition in antitrust cases and applying those values to the NLRA); BE & K Const. Co. v. 
NLRB, 536 U.S. 516, 122 S. Ct. 2390, 153 L. Ed. 2d 499 (2002) (applying the sham litigation standard developed in Pro. Real 
Estate Invs., an antitrust case, to the NLRA). Multiple lower courts have done the same, as discussed in this section. It is true that some courts have questioned the direct of application of Noerr-Pennington outside of antitrust. For example, the 
Tenth Circuit applies the immunity developed in Noerr and Pennington ""beyond antitrust situations,"" but ""refer[s] to it as Petition 
Clause immunity, reserving the name, Noerr-Pennington, for antitrust cases."" CSMN Invs., LLC v. Cordillera Metro. Dist., 956 
F.3d 1276, 1283 (10th Cir. 2020); see also DIRECTV, Inc. v. Cavanaugh, 321 F. Supp. 2d 825, 840-41 (E.D. Mich. 2003) 
(recognizing ""the incongruity of applying the Noerr-Pennington doctrine out of the antitrust context"" and concluding that ""the 
clearest, if not most legally accurate manner to examine DIRECTV's claim of immunity is under the Petition Clause of the First 
Amendment"") (citing Cardtoons, L.C. v. Major League Baseball Players Ass'n, 208 F.3d 885 (10th Cir. 2000)); Audi AG and 
Volkswagon of Am., Inc. v. D'Amato, 341 F. Supp. 2d 734, 758 (E.D. Mich. 2004) (""Initially, courts were careful in referring to the 
Noerr-Pennington doctrine only by analogy when discussing the First Amendment right to petition."" (quoting Eaton v. Newport 
Bd. of Educ., 975 F.2d 292 (6th Cir. 1992)). According to these courts, Noerr-Pennington was based on both the Sherman Act 
and the First Amendment right to petition; of course, when applying immunity beyond antitrust and Sherman Act, it must be 
based on the right to petition. See Cardtoons, 208 F.3d at 889, reversed on other grounds by Csmn Invs., 956 F.3d 1276. For 
the Tenth Circuit, ""[t]his distinction is not completely academic."" Id. at 890. In Cardtoons, for example, relying on the right to 
petition, rather than Noerr-Pennington, the court held that the plaintiff's prelitigation threats of suit to the defendant were not 
immunized because ""there is no petition addressed to the government."" Id. at 893; cf. Sosa, 437 F.3d at 937-38 (""[W]e regard 
the Cardtoons decision as an outlier, inconsistent with the weight of authority relevant to the First Amendment status of presuit 
litigation-related conduct.""). Nevertheless, that case addressed the narrow issue of whether immunity applied to prelitigation 
actions. The court finds no reason, nor has EQMD provided one, to find that Defendants are not immune from suit regardless of 
whether the court calls it Petition Clause immunity or Noerr-Pennington; here, Defendants were directly petitioning the courts. "
1340,2," HN15[
] Because the Noerr-Pennington doctrine is designed to protect First Amendment rights, and because an improper application of the sham exception could chill the exercise of such rights, a plaintiff alleging that conduct otherwise covered by the 
Noerr-Pennington doctrine falls within the sham exception must comply with Rule 9(b) by pleading with particularity ""the 'who, 
what, where, when and how' of the misconduct,"" as well as plead ""allegations regarding the specific activities which bring the 
defendant's conduct into one of the Noerr-Pennington exceptions."" GMA Cover Corp. v. Saab Barracuda LLC, No. 4:10-CV-
12060, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25543, 2012 WL 642739, at *11 (E.D. Mich. Feb. 8, 2012). "
1353,1," Another rule prohibits a nonattorney from holding himself ""out to the public or otherwise representing [him]self as authorized to 
practice law in Ohio."" Gov.Bar R. VII(2)(A)(4). The consent decree does not find a violation of this rule, and it would be a stretch 
to conclude through the language employed on his website that Amatore held himself out as an attorney. "
1380,1," For purposes of the pending motion, Defendants have not challenged the assignment made by McKesson to KPH or the 
assignment made by Kerr to FWK. "
1382,2," District court decisions within the Ninth Circuit are in accord with Kramer and Mundi. See, e.g.: • Soto v. Am. Honda Motor Co., 946 F Supp. 2d 949, 952-54 (N.D. Cal. 2012) (Illston, J.) (rejecting defendant's argument 
that the issue of whether it could compel arbitration as a third-party nonsignatory had to be decided by the arbitrator; stating 
that ""the threshold issue of whether the delegation clause is even applicable to a certain party must be decided [*31]  by the 
Court"" because ""[t]he provisions granting authority to the arbitrator to decide issues of scope are by definition are only 
applicable to the parties of the agreement"" — arbitration clause covered ""'[a]ny claim or dispute ... between you or us'""). • Lomeli v. Midland Funding, LLC, No. 19-CV-01141-LHK, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 166151, at *3, 24 (N.D. Cal. Sep. 26, 
2019) (agreeing with Soto; arbitration clause covered 'any claim, dispute, or controversy between you and us""). • Aliff v. Vervent, Inc., No. 20-cv-00697-DMS-AHG, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 175778, at *22-23 (S.D. Cal. Sep. 24, 2020) 
(noting that ""[t]he Loan Agreements' arbitration provisions are limited to disputes which may be submitted to arbitration 'at 
my or your election' — i.e., at either the election of Plaintiffs or DBTCA as Liberty Bank's assignee[;] [t]hey do not provide 
that a third party may elect to submit a loan-related dispute to arbitration,"" and therefore there was no clear and 
unmistakable evidence that plaintiffs and a nonsignatory agreed to arbitrate arbitrability). "
1384,3," In Blanton, the plaintiff was a former employee of a Domino's franchise. He filed a class action against Domino's, ""alleging that 
the company's franchise agreement violated federal antitrust law as well as state law."" Blanton, 962 F.3d at 844. Domino's 
moved to compel arbitration based on an arbitration agreement that the plaintiff had entered into with the Domino's franchise. 
The Sixth Circuit held that an arbitrator should have decided the issue of whether Domino's, as a nonsignatory, could compel 
arbitration — citing the incorporation of the AAA Rules in the arbitration agreement between the plaintiff and the Domino's 
franchise. See id. at 846 (stating that incorporation of the AAA rules if clear and unmistakable evidence that the parties agreed to 
arbitrate arbitrability)."
1384,4, The Court grants Defendants' motion for leave to file a statement of recent decision. 
1385,5," Defendants admit that Kerr was incorporated in Michigan (and had a principal place of business there as well) but note that 
Kerr has now ceased operations. "
1386,6," Plaintiffs have suggested that there is reliance on the terms of a written agreement only where a claim asserts a violation of a 
duty or obligation imposed by the agreement. See Opp'n at 13. In support, they cite Murphy v. DirecTV,, Inc., 724 F.3d 1218 (9th 
Cir. 2013), where the Ninth Circuit stated: ""[i]n California, equitable estoppel is inapplicable where a plaintiff's 'allegations reveal 
no claim of any violation of any duty, obligation, term or condition imposed by the ... agreements.""' Id. at 1230. But the Murphy 
court was quoting from the state court decision in Goldman and, while Goldman did use this language, Goldman also noted 
more broadly that equitable estoppel ""prevent[s] a party from using the terms or obligations as the basis for his claims against a 
nonsignatory, while at the same time refusing to arbitrate with the nonsignatory under another clause of that same agreement."" 
Goldman, 173 Cal. App. 4th at 221; see also id. at 230 (noting that ""[plaintiff's] allegations reveal no claim of any violation of any 
duty, obligation, term or condition imposed by the operating agreements[,] [nJor is there any claim founded in or even 
tangentially related to any duty, obligation, term or condition imposed by the operating agreements"") (emphasis added). "
1387,7," In support of their position, Defendants have cited, inter alia, MS Dealer, 177 F.3d at 942; JLM Industries, Inc. v. Stolt-
Nielsen SA, 387 F.3d 163 (2d Cir. 2004); and In re Apple & AT&TM Antitrust Litig., 826 F. Supp. 2d 1168 (N.D. Cal. 2011). "
1388,8, Defendants have not provided a copy of any agreement between Kerr and Gilead. 
1389,9," The breadth accorded to ""arising out of or related to"" language, for purposes of determining the parties' obligations to each 
other, stands in contrast to the more rigorous ""founded in and inextricably bound up"" test for equitable estoppel applicable to 
nonsignatories discussed supra. "
1390,10," Plaintiffs' argument here is contained in their opposition to the motion to compel arbitration, not their opposition to the motion 
to dismiss. "
1391,11," The following are representative nonassignment provisions: • ""This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and assigns. 
Neither Party shall assign this Agreement to any third party without the prior written consent of the other Party, whether by 
operation of law or otherwise, and any purported assignment lacking such consent shall be of no effect."" Burke Decl., Ex. B 
(McKesson-Gilead Agreement § 19(f)); see also Burke Decl., Ex. C (McKesson-BMS-Gilead Agreement § 19(f)). • ""Neither Party shall assign, subcontract or otherwise transfer this Agreement or any interest herein or right or obligation 
hereunder without the prior written consent of the other Party including and any such purported assignment, transfer or 
attempt to assign or transfer any interest herein or right or obligation hereunder shall be void and of no effect."" Burke Decl., 
Ex. D (McKesson-BMS Agreement § 10.1); see also Burke Decl., Ex. F (Kerr-BMS [*62]  Agreement § 10.1)."
1391,12," In its papers and at the hearing, FWK never argued that participation by Kerr would have been impossible because it is no 
longer in business. Indeed, at the hearing, FWK indicated that there is still a Kerr representative who could have engaged in the 
dispute resolution process."
1391,13," Defendants may have claims against McKesson and Kerr in spite of the assignment to Plaintiffs. See, e.g., Scarpulla Decl., 
Ex. 6 (letter) (BMS arguing that, ""even if McKesson does not control the claim, BMS does not agree that there is no practical "
1392,," purpose to the meeting"" because 'BMS expects McKesson to indemnify it both for its expenses incurred in moving to dismiss the 
KPH complaint as well as for any future expenses incurred in defending against KPH's claims"")."
1392,14," KPH did have an earlier lawsuit against Gilead, BMS, Janssen, and Japan Tobacco, but it voluntarily dismissed that suit. See 
KPH Healthcare Servs., Inc. v. Gilead Holdings, LLC, No. C-20-0880 EMC (N.D. Cal.) (filed on February 5, 2020 and voluntarily 
dismissed on June 23, 2020). "
1393,15," See Hexcel, 681 F.3d at 1062 (noting that ""the accrual doctrine for a discovery rule is conceptually distinct from the equitable 
tolling doctrine in fraudulent concealment cases""; ""under the federal common law discovery rule, 'a claim accrues when the 
plaintiff knows or has reason to know of the injury which is the basis of the action'""). "
1394,16," In a subsequent opinion, Garrison v. Oracle Corp., 159 F. Supp. 3d 1044 (N.D. Cal. 2016) (Koh, J.), Judge Koh clarified that 
an antitrust claim accrues when the defendant engages in the anticompetitive conduct. See id. at 1065. Judge Koh noted that, 
although she referred to an injury rule in Animation Workers, that case did not address the issue of ""whether accrual began at 
the time of injury or the time of the alleged anticompetitive conduct."" Id. at 1066. "

1473,11," The first affidavit is that of Tina Floyd, Smucker's Senior Vice President and General Manager, Consumer Foods. (Floyd Decl. 
¶ 1.) Floyd makes various averments regarding the parties' respective positions in the peanut butter market and that Hormel 
sells SKIPPY peanut butter in Kroger stores in Ohio. (Id. ¶¶ 2, 3.) Floyd avers that ""[i]f Hormel actively monitors the peanut 
butter market, as it claims to do, I would be extremely surprised if it was not aware of ConAgra's use of a light blue jar and lid for 
PETER PAN whipped creamy peanut butter at or near the time the packaging debuted."" (Id. ¶ 3.) Floyd also avers that Hormel 
announced its SKIPPY no added sugar and squeeze pack product in June 2020, which were the same product innovations 
announced by Smucker in February 2020. (Id. ¶ 5.) With respect to the declaration submitted by Smucker's counsel, Christina 
Moser, she avers that, attached to her declaration is a true and correct copy of: (1) an article regarding Skippy's new product line 
on foodbusinessnews.com dated June 3, 2020 (Moser Decl. ¶ 2); (2) an article from The Takeout titled ""It's Skippy vs. Jif in the 
Battle of the Squeezable Peanut Butter Pouches"" (id. ¶ 3); (3) a June 16, 2020 Office Action issued by the USPTO regarding 
application Serial No. 88/895,128 requiring Hormel to provide evidence that the color teal has acquired source-identifying 
significance in the mind of the consumer (id. ¶ 4; Doc. No. 14-5 at 200); and (4) an archived web page from ConAgra's website 
showing that PETER PAN creamy whipped peanut butter has been sold with a light blue label and lid at least as early as 
February 22, 2019 (id. ¶ 5). "
1475,12," Claim 3—tortious interference with prospective economic advantage—is grounded in Smucker's claim that ""Hormel has 
leveraged baseless accusations of trade dress infringement to interfere with Smucker's nationwide [new product] launch and to 
secure media attention for its own June product launch."" (Compl. ¶ 78.) Smucker alleges that Hormel ""has no legitimate 
justification for its baseless accusations of trade dress infringement[,]"" and that as a result of Hormel's baseless accusations, 
Smucker's new product launch will be impeded. (Id. ¶¶ 79, 80.) Claim 4—unfair competition—is grounded in Smucker's claim 
that ""Hormel has no enforceable trade dress rights in the color teal on peanut butter"" and has leveraged baseless accusations of 
trade dress infringement to interfere with Smucker's [new product] launch."" (Id. ¶¶ 85, 87.) Smucker alleges that ""Hormel has no 
legitimate justification for its baseless accusations of trade dress infringement[,] and as a ""result of Hormel's baseless

1477,15," Hormel's cease and desist letters provide lengthy explanations of its position, cite case law supporting its trade dress 
infringement claim based upon color, state that the color teal has been on its Skippy products since the 1980's, and points to 
Smucker's own efforts to secure trade dress protection based upon color. (See e.g. Doc. No. 1-3.)"
1477,16," Because the Court concludes that Hormel's trade dress infringement claims are not objectively baseless, it need not address 
Hormel's subjective intent. "
1479,1," Defendant Brent Brewbaker (""Brewbaker""), an employee of defendant Contech, responded in support of defendant Contech's 
motion. (Def. Brewbaker's Resp. Supp. (DE 49)). "
1480,2," A joint status report is due from the parties on March 31, 2021, in response to the court's March 1, 2021, order regarding 
defendant's motion to compel. Issues raised in that report for the court's consideration will be addressed in a separate order 
entered after such report is filed. "
1485,3," Defendant Contech contends that the government has attempted to ""writ[e] an indictment that skillfully sweeps [the third 
unindicted company] under the rug in its description of the market."" (Def. Contech's Reply (DE 53) 7). However, the indictment 
alleges that ""[d]uring the conspiracy period, [d]efendant Contech Engineered Solutions LLC, Company A, and others submitted 
bids for NCDOT aluminum structure projects,"" indicating that Company A and defendant Contech were not the sole market 
participants. (Indictment (DE 1) ¶ 8). "
1486,4," The Heffernan court considered the meaning of the United States Sentencing Guideline on antitrust violations, which imposes a 
one level offense enhancement for defendants ""whose offense involves the submission of 'noncompetitive bids.'"" 43 F.3d at 
1145 (quoting U.S.S.G. § 2R1.1(b)(1)). However, although finding that ""interpreting 'bid rigging' (equivalently 'noncompetitive 
bids') . . . as meaning bid rotation"" to be the correct result, the court admitted that the interpretation was its ""best guess as to the 
meaning of the antitrust guideline"" because ""its treatment of bidding is a muddle,"" while also recognizing that the guideline's 
reference to ""'a bid-rigging case in which the organization submitted one or more complementary bids' impl[ies] that some bid 
rigging does not or at least need not involve bid rotation."" Id. at 1148, 1150 (quoting U.S.S.G. 2R1.1(d)(3)). Further, in 
considering the same issue, the Fourth Circuit came to a different conclusion that Heffernan, stating that it was ""not persuaded 
that § 2R1.1(b)(1) . . . is limited to bid-rotation cases."" United States v. Romer, 148 F.3d 359, 371 (4th Cir. 1998) (acknowledging 
and explicitly declining to reach the same conclusion as Heffernan), abrogated on other grounds by Neder v. United States, 527 
U.S. 1, 119 S. Ct. 1827, 144 L. Ed. 2d 35 (1999). Further, Heffernan found that despite Portsmouth stating that ""'a requirement that coconspirators agree to reciprocate by 
submitting complementary bids on future projects' is not part of the definition of bid rigging,"" its statement of law was ""inapt"" 
because ""the case was in fact a standard bid rotation case."" Heffernan, 43 F.3d at 1146 (quoting Portsmouth, 694 F.2d at 325) 
(citing Portsmouth, 694 F.2d at 316 & n.2). However, as noted in the text above, the Fourth Circuit after its decision in 
Portsmouth has continued to define bid rigging by the broader definition set forth therein. See Brinkley, 783 F.2d at 1161. "

the distributor will not sell the manufacturer's products."" Valuepest.com of Charlotte, Inc. v. Bayer Corp., 561 F.3d 282, 286 (4th 
Cir. 2009). "
1489,6," The court finds convincing that dual-distribution systems typically refer to distribution of the same product whereas here 
defendant Contech sells aluminum products to a distributor and then submits intentionally losing bids on aluminum product 
installation projects. Compare, e.g., Electronics Communs. Corp. v. Toshiba Am. Consumer Prods., 129 F.3d 240, 243 (2d Cir. 
1997) (explaining that ""where, as here, the manufacturer distributes its products through a distributor and independently[,] . . . 
[this is a] so-called ""dual distribution"" arrangement[]"" and that ""the dispute involves one manufacturer's product""), with Koppers 
652 F.2d at 292 (rejecting that because one conspirator ""was buying all of its road tar"" from the other conspirator at one point 
during the conspiracy, the agreement between the two to rig bids in state lets for ""sale and application of road tar"" was not a 
horizontal bid rigging agreement). Here, the actual ""product"" defendant Contech is alleged to offer as a manufacturer and as a 
bidder differ: as a manufacturer, defendant Contech provides aluminum pieces to Company A; as a bidder on NCDOT projects, 
defendant Contech provides installation and completion of aluminum structures. (See Indictment (DE 1) ¶¶ 7-8). "

(4) Axis Insurance Company; and (5) ten unnamed Doe defendants. See First Am. Compl. (""FAC"") ¶¶ 2-6, ECF No. 1-6. According to HPIH, HII Insurance Solutions is not a business entity, but rather the name under which HPIH does business. See 
Not. Removal ¶ 6, ECF No. 1. Plaintiffs do not dispute that characterization. The court therefore considers the claims against 
HPIH and HII Insurance Solutions jointly in this order. Plaintiffs refer to all of the defendants except Axis as the ""HII Defendants."" See id. ¶ 13. This order adopts that shorthand. "

against the grantee.” (Katsaris v. Cook (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 256, 265 [225 Cal. Rptr. 531], citing 3 Sutherland, Statutory 
Construction (4th ed. 1974) § 63.02, p. 81.)"
1524,5," Fidelity tries to distinguish State Fund on the ground that the article prescribing the scope of immunity for Insurance Code 
section 11758 differs from the underlying articles determining the scope of immunity under section 12414.26. While that may be, 
the relevance of State Fund does not depend on any substantive similarity in what it is those underlying articles authorize, but 
rather on the point that each statute extends immunity only to what is authorized—whatever that may be—and not to acts that 
are related to, but unauthorized by, the underlying article. "
1526,6," The McBride-Grunsky Act was designed only to “enact[] the minimal regulation required to exempt California insurance from 
federal antitrust law.” (King v. Meese (1987) 43 Cal.3d 1217, 1240 [240 Cal. Rptr. 829, 743 P.2d 889] (conc. opn. of Broussard, 
J.).) The law made California “a so-called ‘open rate’ state,” with rates “set by insurers without prior or subsequent approval by 
the … Commissioner.” (Id. at p. 1221 (maj. opn.).) Indeed, the act prohibited the Commissioner from fixing rates, relying instead 
on the open market to dictate rates. (See Ins. Code, former § 1850, added by Stats. 1947, ch. 805, § 1, p. 1896 and repealed by 
Prop. 103, § 7, as approved by voters, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 8, 1988); 20th Century Ins. Co. v. Garamendi (1994) 8 Cal.4th 216, 287, 
fn. 15, 300 [32 Cal. Rptr. 2d 807, 878 P.2d 566].) Under this regime, “‘California ha[d] less regulation of insurance than any other 
state … .’” (Garamendi, at p. 240.)"

1527,10," As originally introduced, the legislation extended immunity to acts authorized under the title insurance chapter. (Sen. Bill No. 
1293 (1973–1974 Reg. Sess.) as amended Aug. 27, 1973, § 15.) Shortly before final passage, the provision was amended to 
narrow immunity to only those acts authorized by specific articles: “No act done, action taken, or agreement made pursuant to 
the authority conferred by Article 5.5 (commencing with Section 12401) or Article 5.7 (commencing with Section 12402) of this 
chapter shall constitute a violation of or grounds for prosecution or civil proceedings under any other law of this state heretofore 
or hereafter enacted which does not specifically refer to insurance.” (Sen. Bill No. 1293 (1973–1974 Reg. Sess.) as amended 
Sept. 10, 1973, § 15.) As noted above (ante, p. 114), in 1988, voters passed Proposition 103, an initiative that discarded much of the original McBride-
Grunsky Act and replaced it with a drastically revised insurance rate regulation scheme. (See generally 20th Century Ins. Co. v. 
Garamendi, supra, 8 Cal.4th at pp. 239–246; Calfarm Ins. Co. v. Deukmejian (1989) 48 Cal.3d 805, 812–813 [258 Cal. Rptr. 
161, 771 P.2d 1247]; MacKay v. Superior Court, supra, 188 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1445–1446.) But the McBride-Grunsky Act's 
exemption for title insurance was left in place (see Ins. Code, §§ 1851, subd. (d), 1861.13; Calfarm Ins. Co., at p. 812, fn. 1), and 
so these reforms did not alter the framework for title insurance rate regulation, which remains subject to the McBride-Grunsky-
Act-style rules specific to title insurance adopted in 1973. "
1528,11," Concerning the parallel language in a sister statute, the Court of Appeal has observed: “[W]hile the initial motivation behind 
Insurance Code section 1860.1 may have been exemption from antitrust laws in particular, it was recognized [at the time of 
enactment] that the language of the exemption was, in fact, broader.” (MacKay v. Superior Court, supra, 188 Cal.App.4th at p. 
1445.) Neither Villanueva nor the Commissioner addresses whether the language of section 12414.26 sweeps more broadly 
than concerted action, and we do not attempt to resolve the issue here. "
1530,12," HN15[
] CA(15)[
] (15) When primary jurisdiction applies, an initial suit in court is permitted, although the trial court may thereafter choose to stay the action and solicit an agency's views. (Jonathan Neil & Assoc., Inc. v. Jones (2004) 33 Cal.4th 917, 
931–933 [16 Cal. Rptr. 3d 849, 94 P.3d 1055]; Farmers Ins. Exchange v. Superior Court (1992) 2 Cal.4th 377, 390–392 [6 Cal. 
Rptr. 2d 487, 826 P.2d 730].) When exhaustion applies, a party must pursue an administrative remedy initially, but may 
thereafter file suit in court. (Jonathan Neil, at pp. 930–931; Farmers Ins. Exchange, at p. 390.) When a statutory regime vests 
exclusive jurisdiction in an agency, in contrast, a party may only proceed administratively and thereafter may only challenge the 
results of any administrative outcome through administrative mandamus (Code Civ. Proc., § 1094.5) or such other means as the 
statutory scheme may specify (see, e.g., Lab. Code, § 1700.44, subd. (a) [exclusive jurisdiction vested in the Labor 
Commissioner, with review by way of trial de novo in superior court]). "
1531,13," Fidelity further notes that other parts of the statutory scheme give the Commissioner additional responsibilities for interpreting 
and enforcing the rate-filing requirements of the title insurance chapter. For example, Insurance Code section 12340.7 gives the 
Commissioner the authority to promulgate regulations identifying certain “miscellaneous charges” that are not subject to 
regulation as rates. But nothing about this grant of rulemaking authority implies exclusive jurisdiction over consumer claims 
based on failure to comply with the relevant provisions of the title insurance law. "
1532,14, That article pertains generally to the licensing of car dealers by the Department of Motor Vehicles. 
1533,15," Fidelity urges that in section 12414.29, “‘[n]o other law relating to insurance’ … means no other law,” and if “the Legislature 
meant to limit section 12414.29 to other provisions in the Insurance Code, it could easily and clearly have said so.” But the 
Legislature did clearly say so, in the very language Fidelity quotes: “no other law relating to insurance” (§ 12414.29, italics 
added), i.e., no other insurance-specific law. When the Legislature intended to reference laws of general application from outside 
the Insurance Code, it used quite different language, as in sections 1860.1 and 12414.26 (“any other law … which does not 
specifically refer to insurance”). "
1537,1," While the complaint asserts that ""[t]he Plaintiff in this case is the Prevent Group—an international supplier with a subsidiary 
registered in this District,"" Compl. ¶ 1, this is not correct. As noted below, Prevent USA identifies itself as one of the companies 
of this group, or as a ""subsidiary"" of Prevent Group, id., while Eastern Horizon identifies itself as a ""holding company for newly-
acquired Prevent Group operating companies."" Id. ¶¶ 22, 23. It is unclear whether the Prevent Group is a distinct legal entity or a 
""network of companies,"" id. ¶ 21, but it is not a named party and it is not ""the plaintiff in this case."" Nonetheless—and 
confusingly— plaintiffs Prevent USA and Eastern Horizon indicate that they use ""Prevent"" and ""the Prevent Group"" to refer to 
themselves collectively. Compl. at 4. See also id. ¶ 16 (""the Prevent Group brings this action against Volkswagen"")."
1537,2," The Court notes that the complaint generally does not differentiate between VWAG and VWGoA, but refers to them jointly as 
""Volkswagen."" See Compl. at 4 (stating that plaintiffs ""file this Complaint . . . against Volkswagen AG and Volkswagen Group of 
America, Inc. (collectively, 'Volkswagen')""). In summarizing the complaint, the Court adopts this convenience, although, as 
discussed below, it is important to keep in mind that Project 1 was, according to the complaint and documents filed by Prevent 
Group companies in other lawsuits in German courts, see infra, conceived in Germany by VWAG. So far as the Court can 
discern, the complaint's only allegation concerning VWGoA's involvement in this scheme was that it ""contributed at least four 
suppliers to the List,"" i.e., Project 1's ""watch list"" of parts suppliers vulnerable to takeover. Compl. ¶ 101. Plaintiffs identify only 
one of these suppliers, FTE, id., and FTE is not among the American companies that Prevent Group allegedly sought to acquire.

Wurnmest is a German law professor with expertise in commercial law, private international law, and comparative law. 
Wurmnest Decl. ¶ 1 and Wurmnest CV (PageID.2262, 2277). The Court is aware that plaintiffs have submitted counter-
declarations from their own experts, German law professors Drs. Koehler (PageID.2138-52) and Lueke (PageID.2153-57), who 
doubt whether plaintiffs' claims could be brought in German courts and note Germany's less generous damages awards and 
more stringent discovery rules. The Court has weighed these competing declarations under Fed. R. Civ. P. 44.1 and is 
convinced that plaintiffs could bring their antitrust and business tort claims in Germany. "
1547,4," This court later dismissed the action. Hass Decl. ¶¶ 14-16, Hass Decl. Ex. 9. Plaintiff alleged, among other things, that VWAG 
sought ""to completely side-line all supply companies of the Prevent Group, as can be seen from the VW presentation designated 
'Project 1.'"" PageID.1286. The court dismissed plaintiff's claims, finding that VWAG had good cause to terminate its supply 
contracts with TWB due to ""the suspension of deliveries by the Prevent Group companies . . . in 2016 and the discontinuation 
levy [i.e., unilateral price increase] charged by [TWB] in violation of the agreement."" PageID.1296. The court went on to note that 
""[t]he suspensions of deliveries implemented by the subsidiary companies Car Trim and ES Guss already by themselves lead to 
a loss of trust vis-a-vis [TWB], justifying the termination of the present contract . . . [because] [t]he suspensions of deliveries at 
that time were unlawful."" Id. The court also rejected plaintiff's antitrust claim that VWAG and Audi abused their market power. 
The court found that TWB failed to show that defendants ""are market-dominant companies"" in light of the ""interchangeability of 
the products"" at issue and plaintiff's demonstrated ability to find other potential customers. PageID.1299."
1547,5," The complaint refers to the assignors of these claims as the ""Cedents"" and identifies them, at various places in the complaint, 
as Prevent DEV GmbH (""Cedent No. 3""), Prevent TWB GmbH & Co. KG (""Cedent No. 4""), Prevent foamtec GmbH (""Cedent No.

3) - 6) . . . and Eastern Horizon"") (PageID.1795); and ES Automobilguss GmbH (PageID.1847) (listing companies whose claims 
have been assigned to Andromeda). Dr. Hass indicates that in March 2020, Andromeda ""informed the court that the claims 
assigned to it by Eastern Horizon had in the meantime been reassigned back to Eastern Horizon and that the plaintiff therefore 
withdraws the complaint with regard to Eastern Horizon's claims."" Hass Decl. ¶ 24. "

denied. "
1567,3, The market power analysis is difficult because Plaintiffs still fail to coherently define the market. 
1570,4," This allegation appears to undercut Plaintiffs' claim that the market should be defined to include news about forthcoming 
American movies based only on ""the talent responsible for creating them."" Presumably, the 400 interviews were not of that 
narrow group of individuals—or, if so, then Plaintiffs are ill-positioned to complain that they lack access to talent when an HFPA 
member had only 25 such opportunities in a three-month period in 2020. (Id. ¶ 48). "

1581,15, Plaintiffs do not provide specific wholesale pricing for Cermaq and SalMar. (See SCAC ¶ 203). 
1583,16," Because section 3 of the Sherman Act merely extends section 1's prohibitions to U.S. territories and the District of Columbia, 
the Court analyzes Plaintiffs' claims under section 1's standards. See Robinson v. Jackson Hewitt, Inc., No. 19-9066, 2019 U.S. "

1584,17," Conscious parallelism is a ""process, not in itself unlawful, by which firms in a concentrated market might in effect share 
monopoly power, setting their prices at a profit-maximizing, supracompetitive level by recognizing their shared economic 
interests and their interdependence with respect to price and output decisions."" Brooke Grp. Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco 
Corp., 509 U.S. 209, 227, 113 S. Ct. 2578, 125 L. Ed. 2d 168 (1993) (citation omitted). "
1585,18," As noted, Defendants also contend ""Plaintiffs do not allege direct evidence that Defendants agreed to fix prices."" (Mot. 15-17). 
Plaintiffs concede they offer no direct evidence that Defendants have entered into a price-fixing agreement. (See Resp. 19 
(stating Plaintiffs need not allege direct evidence of a conspiracy)). "
1586,19," Defendants complain that Plaintiffs simply point to ""vague third-party statements that unnamed 'companies in Norway' and 
'major players' made spot market purchases via 'a truckload here and a truckload there.'"" (Reply 9). Yet, Plaintiffs allege (and 
provide a chart illustrating) ""Norway's salmon industry is dominated by Defendants[,] Mowi, Lerøy, SalMar, Cermaq, and 
Grieg[.]"" (SCAC ¶ 232 (alterations added); see also id. ¶ 228 (""[T]he Norwegian farmed salmon industry is dominated by a few 
top producers with a number of smaller players[.]"" (alterations added)); id. ¶ 231 (""[T]he Norwegian Defendants dominate the 
market."" (alteration added)); Resp. 29 (""Defendants, according to the SCAC, are the five largest players in the Norwegian 
farmed salmon market; they account for nearly 83% of production among the top ten players as listed by Mowi."" (citing SCAC ¶ 
232))). Norway's salmon producers and major players by definition include Mowi, Lerøy, SalMar, Cermaq, and Grieg. (See 
SCAC ¶ 232). Plaintiffs' allegations suggest Defendants, not just Morpol and Mowi, were engaging in spot market purchases in 
order to keep the Index price — and by extension, their prices — high."
1586,20," Defendants insist these allegations do not hint at parallel conduct. (See Mot. 18-19; Reply 8). Defendants contend Plaintiffs do 
not (1) ""point to any parallel spot market sales or purchases by Defendants[;]"" (2) ""explain how spot market sales by Defendants 
that are not members of the NASDAQ Salmon Index Panel could support the alleged conspiracy[;]"" (3) ""provide any facts to 
support their conclusory assertion that spot sales were made at 'supra-competitive' prices[;]"" or (4) ""allege any specific spot 
market sales to Morpol."" (Mot. 18-19 (alterations added; emphasis omitted)). It appears Defendants consider Plaintiffs' 
allegations individually — not as a whole. The Court is unconvinced such an exacting pleading standard applies and declines to 
parse Plaintiffs' allegations to determine whether each allegation is plausible. Cf. Starr v. Sony BMG Music Ent., 592 F.3d 314, 
325 (2d Cir. 2010) (rejecting the defendants' contention that Twombly requires a plaintiff resting on allegations of parallel 
conduct to identify a ""specific time, place or person involved in each conspiracy allegation"")."
1586,21," (See SCAC ¶ 50 (""Grieg ASA targets and sells its salmon to the United States, including Florida, using its majority-owned 
sales agent, Ocean Quality AS[.]"" (alteration added))). "
1587,22," Defendants insist that Plaintiffs fail to allege parallel pricing by any Defendant (see Mot. 19); yet Defendants admit Plaintiffs' 
charts indicate Defendants' pricing moved, at times, in similar directions. (Compare Mot. 21 (""The S[C]AC thus alleges nothing 
more than that the pricing purportedly offered by certain Defendants has moved at times in similar directions[.]"" (alterations and 
emphasis added)), and Reply 11 (""Plaintiffs' graphs show nothing more than that certain Defendants' purported pricing at times 
has moved in similar directions[.]"" (alteration and emphasis added))), with SD3, LLC, 801 F.3d at 427 (stating as a general rule, 
""[a] plaintiff establishes parallel conduct when it pleads facts indicating that the defendants acted 'similarly.'"" (alteration and 
emphasis added; citations omitted))."
1587,23," Defendants also contend Plaintiffs' pricing charts show Defendants' prices ""were rarely the same"" and ""often moved in 
different directions[.]"" (Mot. 20 (alteration added; emphasis omitted)). Plaintiffs are not required to plead parallel conduct that is 
simultaneous or identical. See, e.g., In re Domestic Airline Travel Antitrust Litig., 221 F. Supp. 3d 46, 69 (D.D.C. 2016) 
(""Plaintiffs do not need to demonstrate that Defendants cut or limited capacity in exactly the same way in order to adequately 
allege parallel conduct."" (collecting cases)); In re Blood Reagents Antitrust Litig., 756 F. Supp. 2d 623, 630 (E.D. Pa. 2010) 
(""Plaintiffs are not required to plead simultaneous price increases — or that the price increases were identical — in order to 
demonstrate parallel conduct."" (citation omitted)); City of Moundridge v. Exxon Mobil Corp., No. Civ. A. 04-940, 2009 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 123954, 2009 WL 5385975, at *5 (D.D.C. Sept. 30, 2009) (""Price-fixing can occur even though the price increases are not 
identical in absolute or relative terms."" (citations omitted))."
1587,24," Defendants maintain ""allegations that individual Defendants increased profits over time . . . do not support an inference of 
conspiracy."" (Mot. 22 (alteration added; citing In re Generic Pharms. Pricing Antitrust Litig., 386 F. Supp. 3d 477, 483 (E.D. Pa. 
2019) (""[The plaintiffs] ha[ve] not directed the [c]ourt to any authority that would support the proposition that [the defendants'] 
conduct . . . was parallel to the manufacturer [d]efendants' conduct simply because each are alleged to have seen increased 
profits."" (alterations added))). Although at first glance the point is alluring, the plaintiffs in In re Generic Pharmaceuticals Pricing 
Antitrust Litigation, unlike Plaintiffs here, ""ma[d]e[] no explicit allegations of parallel conduct by [the defendants]."" 386 F. Supp. 
3d at 483 (alterations added). Plaintiffs' allegations of increased profits are relevant when considering the entirety of the SCAC's 
parallel conduct allegations — especially given the allegations Defendants attributed those unprecedented earnings to high spot 
market prices. (See SCAC ¶¶ 139, 210, 215-16)."
1587,25," Defendants contend Plaintiffs insufficiently allege SalMar, Grieg, and Cermaq's participation in the conspiracy, citing 
""Plaintiffs['] fail[ure] to allege any pricing behavior at all"" for these Defendants. (Mot. 19 (alterations added; original emphasis); 
see also Reply 11). If Plaintiffs' parallel conduct allegations hinged on pricing charts, the Court would likely agree with 
Defendants. Unfortunately for these Defendants, that is not the case. (See, e.g., SCAC ¶ 136 (alleging SalMar and Cermaq were 
members of the Advisory Panel); id. ¶¶ 139-40, 144, 147, 150, 152, 185 (discussing Defendants' alleged involvement with the 
NASDAQ Salmon Index and the spot market); id. ¶¶ 204, 207; App. 11-14 (providing wholesale pricing data for Grieg's sales "
1588,," agent in the United States, Ocean Quality AS); SCAC ¶¶ 208-09 (supplying charts of spot market activity in 2013-2016); id. ¶¶ 
213, 215-16 (providing earnings reports for these Defendants and alleging these unprecedented earnings were a product of the 
noncompetitive spot prices reported on the NASDAQ Salmon Index); Resp. 16 (collecting allegations)). These allegations 
plausibly tie SalMar, Grieg, and Cermaq to the conspiracy."
1588,26," Defendants contend the SCAC's ""attempt to focus on a single source of demand, while ignoring other supply and demand 
factors during the same period, renders Plaintiffs' claim[s] implausible."" (Mot. 40 (alteration added; citing SCAC ¶¶ 8, 26, 82, 93, 
161, 168, 237, 242, 246-48, 255-56)). The Court disagrees the cited allegations render Plaintiffs' claims implausible. Although 
Defendants insist ""[t]he Russian import ban impacted only a small portion of total global demand"" (Mot. 38-39 (alteration 
added)), Plaintiffs plausibly allege Defendants reacted to this constriction of the market by colluding together to manipulate the 
NASDAQ Salmon Index in order to protect themselves from the effect of the ban. (See SCAC ¶¶ 8, 147, 156, 165, 167, 173; see 
also id. ¶¶ 8, 215-17 (explaining Defendants attributed high profits to market and spot prices, not high production costs or strong 
demand)). "
1590,27," Defendants contend ""none of Plaintiffs' allegations regarding Defendants' communications and participation in meetings go 
beyond mere opportunities to conspire"" (Mot. 29 (emphasis omitted)); ""it is entirely appropriate for trade associations to discuss 
such industry issues, and Defendants' participation in those discussions does not support an inference of conspiracy"" (id. 31); 
""the [SAS] database does not provide access to company-specific real-time pricing"" (id. 32 (alteration added)); and ""unsupported 
assertions . . . are entirely implausible given that . . . NSC is owned and operated by the Norwegian Ministry of Trade, Industry 
and Fisheries, a governmental body; and [] participation in NSC is required by Norwegian law"" (id. 33 (alterations added)). As 
Plaintiffs persuasively argue, ""[t]hese trade association activities . . . constitute a recognized plus factor to be considered in the 
context of the totality of the facts pled in the SCAC."" (Resp. 42 (alterations and emphasis added; footnote call number omitted)). 
Again, Plaintiffs include additional details addressing Defendants' joint involvement in trade associations and do not simply rely 
on the fact Defendants belonged to these associations. Compare In re Interior Molded Doors Antitrust Litig., No. 3:18-cv-00718, 
2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 161045, 2019 WL 4478734, at *5 (E.D. Va. Sept. 18, 2019) (""These two things — the defendants' mutual 
attendance of at least eight separate annual trade association meetings and their history of swapping executives — make it 
more plausible that the alleged conspiracy spawned from meetings at trade shows or conventions.""), with (SCAC ¶ 194 (mutual

 [*56] and id. ¶¶ 153, 228 (noting the mobility among executives of certain Defendants)). "
1591,28," In re Florida Cement & Concrete Antitrust Litigation, 746 F. Supp. 2d 1291 (S.D. Fla. 2010) (""FCCAL""), on which Defendants 
rely, is off point. There, the undersigned held (1) international government investigations into conduct entirely separate from and 
not connected to that alleged in the pleading could not support an inference of conspiracy; and (2) ""the decision by the Florida 
Attorney General to investigate one Defendant and one executive of that Defendant d[id] not make the conspiracy alleged . . . 
more plausible because the outcome of the investigation [could not] be predicted."" Id. at 1315-16 (alterations added). The 
allegations in FCCAL are not analogous to the allegations presented here. (See, e.g., SCAC ¶¶ 4-6, 102-28, 257-64 (discussing 
the EC and DOJ's decisions to investigate numerous Defendants, not one; and providing connection between the international 
investigation of anticompetitive conduct and Defendants' alleged conduct in the SCAC)). "
1592,29," Plaintiffs also seek refuge in the injury discovery rule. (See SCAC ¶ 265; Resp. 48 n.24). Since Plaintiffs adequately allege 
Defendants concealed their conspiracy, the Court does not address Plaintiffs' alternative argument."
1592,30," Defendants request the Court set the bounds of the damages period available to Plaintiffs. (See Reply 25 (""And in the event 
that the continuing violations doctrine were to apply, Plaintiffs themselves concede the class period — and, accordingly, the 
damages period — would begin no earlier than April 23, 2015."")). The Court declines to do so at the motion-to-dismiss stage, 
especially given the other allegations that Defendants concealed the anticompetitive conspiracy. "
1607,1," Further (albeit unnecessary) support for the Court's conclusion is provided by The App Association's contention that the United 
Kingdom action will yield a rate that is not FRAND. (See generally D.I. 35) Without crediting (or rejecting) this argument, the 
Court observes that the possibility that the ultimate U.K. court determination may not truly be FRAND weighs in favor of finding 
antitrust standing. "
1608,2," Indeed, it appears that Lenovo prepared a table of ETSI declarations identical to that utilized in Microsoft. Compare Microsoft 
Mobile, Inc. v. InterDigital, Inc., C.A. No. 15-723-RGA D.I. 1 ¶ 44 tbl. with Lenovo (United States) Inc. v. InterDigital, Inc., C.A. 
No. 20-493-LPS D.I. 1 ¶ 61."
1608,3," Several of the authorities on which IDC relies for its contrary view are from outside of the Third Circuit and do not follow 
Broadcom, which is binding on this Court. See, e.g., FTC v. Qualcomm, 969 F.3d 974, 1005 (9th Cir. 2020); Continental Auto. 
Sys., Inc. v. Avanci, LLC, 485 F. Supp. 3d 712 735 (N.D. Tex. 2020), 485 F. Supp. 3d 712. "
1609,4," Lenovo's claims might possibly survive even after such determinations, an issue the Court does not decide today. (See 
generally Tr. at 50-51) (Lenovo: ""So when you look at the royalties demanded, you look at the portfolios that would be covered, 
you look at where and how royalties would be assessed on a geographic basis vis-à-vis InterDigital's actual patent holdings, you 
look at the relevant strength of patents, there could be a situation when you put that all together [that] doing it in arbitration is 
reasonable. But simply saying that it's going to be done in arbitration is not itself . . . a get-out-of-jail free card or cure-all."")"
1609,5," The Court need not reach Lenovo's allegations that such proceedings are unfair or substantively biased against Lenovo. (E.g., 
D.I. 15 at 10-14) These allegations, if taken as true, would provide additional grounds for the Court's conclusion as to the 
sufficiency of Lenovo's Section 2 claim. "

1617,7," Though plaintiff states that he is not seeking relief against Winston based on any state law claims, plaintiff nonetheless asserts 
state law claims as against Winston. "
1618,8, The amended complaint contains no state law Count VII. 
1620,9, Defendant Winston also contends Plaintiff's current action is barred by the doctrine against claim splitting. 
1622,10," Whether the HCSD has done so in this case consistent with applicable state laws is properly the subject of Plaintiff's various 
state law claim, including his claim that the HCSD violated California's Brown Act. "
1623,11," Because Defendant Winston cannot be held liable under §1983, the Court does not consider his substantive arguments 
regarding Plaintiff's various federal claims. "
1625,12," Strict scrutiny applies to equal protection claims alleging race-based or religious discrimination (i.e., where the plaintiff is 
member of a ""protected class""); minimal scrutiny applies to all other equal protection claims. See Lee v. City of Los Angeles, 250 
F.3d 668, 686-67 (9th Cir. 2001). "

the Sherman Act, the Cartwright Act, and the UCL are all subject to a four-year statute of limitations."")."
1657,4," Although both parties address tolling under federal law, California tolling rules apply as the Court has dismissed the Sherman 
Act claim and only California claims remain. "
1658,5," Defendants fault Plaintiffs for not refuting the ""body of cases establishing that the discovery rule does not apply."" (Dkt. No. 266 
at 33.) But Defendants cite only one case holding that the discovery rule does not apply to Cartwright Act cases. (Dkt. No. 224 at 
49.) "
1659,6," The Court takes judicial notice of the tolling agreements under the incorporation-by-reference doctrine. Under this doctrine, ""[a] 
court may consider evidence on which the complaint necessarily relies if: (1) the complaint refers to the document; (2) the 
document is central to the plaintiff's claim; and (3) no party questions the authenticity of the copy attached to the 12(b)(6) 
motion."" Marder v. Lopez, 450 F.3d 445, 448 (9th Cir. 2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). "

Health, Inc., No. 20-cv-2255 EJD."
1671,2," The Background is a brief summary of the allegations in the Corrected Class Action Complaint (hereinafter ""Complaint""). See 
Dkt. No. 6. "
1672,3," Elsewhere, Plaintiffs allege that Cigna promised it would ""pay rates based upon UCR"" (id. ¶ 18); communicated and 
represented that Plaintiffs would be reimbursed at the UCR (id. ¶¶ 22, 99); told Plaintiffs that benefits were paid at UCR rates (id. 
¶¶ 30, 137); verified that claims will be paid/reimbursed at UCR rates (id. ¶¶ 135, 146); represented that it would pay providers at 
the UCR rate (id. ¶157); routinely represented that benefits were available at a UCR rate (id. ¶ 171); and represented that 
benefits were determined based on the UCR rate (id. ¶ 174). "
1673,4," Cigna interprets the Complaint as alleging that Cigna underpaid OON claims by not paying them at full billed charges. Reply at 
1. Plaintiffs deny alleging that Cigna is required to pay 100% of providers' charges and accuse Cigna of mischaracterizing the 
Complaint. Opp'n to Cigna's Mot. at 1. The allegations in the Complaint speak for themselves. Plaintiffs repeatedly allege that 
Plaintiffs and Cigna ""understood that UCR rates were traditionally equivalent to 100% of [Plaintiffs'] billed charges."" Id. ¶¶ 196, 
203, 210, 217."
1673,5," The Complaint alleges that Summit Estate Inc. d/b/a Summit Estate Outpatient has been ""overpaid"" by at least $325,000.00. Id. 
¶ 219. The Court assumes that ""overpaid"" is a typographical error. "

1676,9," Plaintiffs argue that Cigna ""has made no showing that every patient with an underpaid claim had an ERISA plan."" Opp'n to

Cal. Mar. 12, 2013). "
1683,13," Plaintiffs allege only a per se violation of Section 1, therefore the Court need not consider a rule-of-reason theory of antitrust 
liability. "
1689,1," The Court also notes that Plaintiffs have not meaningfully responded to Defendants' assertions of legitimate business 
purposes. Plaintiffs' main response to these assertions is that OJC was never informed of these reasons, even during 
negotiations to reinstate the agreement, and that KidKraft's failure to inform OJC of these reasons is evidence that they are 
pretextual. ECF No. 144 at page 29. However, the Court notes that the record contains enough evidence from which a jury could 
conclude that at least one of the reasons provided are pretextual. For example, although KidKraft maintains that one of the 
reasons it ended its relationship with OJC was OJC's status as a difficult customer, Chris Light testified that KidKraft did not cut 
OJC off from all its other products. See ECF No. 235-14 and 3-4. "
1692,1," As described in Plaintiff's Complaint, ""portfolio accounting software"" provides firms with easily managed accounting tools to 
maintain the firm's books and records. Compl. ¶ 18. Portfolio accounting software also allows a firm to easily run reports required 
by various regulatory authorities. Compl. ¶ 18. Plaintiff alleges that ""the vast majority, if not all, Complex Funds [defined as 
investment firms with more than $5 billion in assets under management] . . . use Portfolio Accounting Software."" Compl. ¶ 19."
1692,2," As defined in the Complaint, ""Post-Trade Solutions"" include software and systems designed to assist funds in executing ""post-
trade tasks, including (i) portfolio accounting, (ii) cash management, (iii) collateral management, (iv) data management and 
corporate action processing, and (v) reconciliation."" Compl. ¶ 21. The Court understands Arcesium's Platform to be an example 
of a system that provides ""Post-Trade Solutions."" "
1693,3," The Reseller Agreement was attached in full to the declaration of counsel submitted in support of Defendants' motion to 
dismiss. The contract was filed under seal to protect confidential customer names and trade secret information. See Order 
Granting Letter Motion to Seal, ECF No. 85. However, throughout the publicly accessible briefs in this case, both Parties cite to 
numerous provisions of the Reseller Agreement. The Court takes this to mean that the content of the agreement that was 
referenced or included in the briefs is not confidential or subject to sealing. The Court references some of these citations and 
provisions in this Opinion."
1693,4," Plaintiff labels these as ""Continuation Rights"" in the Complaint, but Defendants point out that the term does not appear in the 
Reseller Agreement at all. See Memorandum of Law in Support of Motion to Dismiss, ECF No. 79, at 7. Nonetheless, the Court 
employs the term here as used in the Complaint to refer to Arcesium's rights that survive the termination of the Reseller 
Agreement."
1693,5," As alleged, the Continuation Rights could extend in perpetuity, provided that Arcesium and its customer continued to renew 
their customer agreement. Compl.¶ 56. However, Defendants point out that Reseller Agreement gives Defendants the ability to 
terminate a customer's sub-license to use Geneva on 35 days' notice. See Memorandum of Law in Support of Motion to 
Dismiss, ECF No. 79, at 7 (citing Reseller Agreement § 6.9). "
1694,6," Multiple times throughout the Complaint, Plaintiff attempts to cast SS&C and Advent as a single entity following SS&C's 
purchase of Advent. See, e.g., Compl. ¶¶ 35, 87."
1694,7," Both Parties' legal memoranda and declarations are filed twice on the ECF docket, one in a publicly accessible redacted form 
and a second unredacted copy filed under seal. Compare, e.g., ECF No. 79 (Defendants' memorandum in support of the motion 
to dismiss in redacted public form), with ECF No. 82 (sealed filing of the unredacted version). Throughout this Opinion, the Court 
uses the ECF docket numbers of the publicly accessible versions of the files. "
1699,8," Plaintiff's allegations regarding the termination of Plaintiff's Continuation Rights also is not an antitrust injury because it flowed 
from Defendants' alleged breach of the contract and not from their refusal to deal or other exclusive arrangements. However, 
there also is support that a breach of a contract that results in more competition for Plaintiff—like Defendants' actions had here—
is per se not an antitrust violation. See Apotex Corp., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2343, 2020 WL 58247, at *4-5 (collecting cases). "
1703,1," The following facts are taken from the Complaint and records from this Court and the Ninth Circuit in prior litigation involving 
plaintiff, of which this Court takes judicial notice as described later in this Opinion. "
1713,2," Initially, OSB also argued that it was entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity as an arm of the state, doc. 82 at 2-4, but 
withdrew the argument after the Ninth Circuit held that it was not in Crowe v. Oregon State Bar, 989 F.3d 714, 2021 WL 748511, 
* 11-14 (9th Cir. 2021). Doc. 124."
1713,3," Although the Ninth Circuit does not appear to have addressed this issue, courts including the Second, Third, Sixth, and 
Eleventh Circuits have followed Doyle to hold that private citizen complainants lack standing to challenge a state bar's handling 
of a complaint against an attorney. See Osborn v. Miller, No. 97-5470, 1998 U.S. App. LEXIS 1682, 1998 WL 57286 (6th Cir.

2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16540, 2015 WL 5703723 (D. N.H. Feb. 10, 2015) (New Hampshire). This Court finds the analysis in 
Doyle and those cases persuasive and adopts it here. "
1714,4," Docket Number 68 in Clark IV, also excerpted on page 118 of the Complaint in this case, is a protective order limiting plaintiff's 
communications with Wells Fargo and people associated with it. Though the order also states that failure to comply with its 
requirements ""will result in sanctions for contempt of court, which may include dismissal of this proceeding[,]"" doc. 68 at 2, the 
claims against Wells Fargo were dismissed on a motion to dismiss, doc. 128 (granting Wells Fargo's Motion to Dismiss, and 
dismissing claims with prejudice). "
1715,5," Under Oregon law, a claim for legal malpractice ""must be commenced within two years of the date on which the claim accrues."" 
Stevens v. Bispham, 316 Or. 221, 227, 851 P.2d 556 (1993). And Oregon courts use the ""discovery rule"" to determine when a 
claim for legal malpractice accrues. Kaseberg v. Davis Wright Tremaine, LLP, 351 Or. 270, 277, 265 P.3d 777 (2011). "
1717,1, Defendants do not oppose this Motion.
1717,2," The Settlement was previously filed as Exhibit 1 to the Declaration of Carolyn Hunt Cottrell in Support of Plaintiffs' Motion for 
Preliminary Approval of Class and Collective Action Settlement, Certification of Settlement Class, Approval of Notice of 
Settlement, and Setting of Hearing for Final Approval. "
1718,3," The average recovery for the California Class Members is $940.31 and for the 86 Opt-In Plaintiffs is $1,466.05. (Declaration of 
Scott M. Fenwick of Heffler Claims group in Support of Proposed Class Notice [""Fenwick Decl.""], 1110.) The actual average 
recoveries are higher than the numbers provided here, as the averages are calculated by Heffler based on the assumption that 
Class Counsel would be awarded the maximum amount of costs (i.e., $20,000) pursuant to the Settlement. (See Cottrell Decl. at 
f 42.)"
1718,4," ""Of this amount, $26,250 is to be paid to California Labor and Workforce Development Agency (""L WD A""), while $8,750 is to 
be distributed to the Participating Class Members in addition to and as part of the Net Settlement Amount. (Declaration of 
Carolyn Hunt Cottrell in Support of Plaintiffs' Motion for Final Approval of Class and Collective Action Settlement [""Cottrell

1718,5," The Settlement Class is defined as all current and former hourly, non-exempt employees who worked as Technicians for 
Defendants in the state of California between May 22, 2019 and August 4, 2020. (Settlement, ¶ 2.b; Cottrell Decl. at ¶ 38.)"
1718,6," The Parties subsequently agreed to a Tolling and Dismissal Agreement (""Tolling Agreement"") on June 26, 2020, whereby 
Plaintiffs agreed to dismiss their Class and Collective action without prejudice in federal court, and TAK agreed that no statute of 
limitations on any claim would run against Plaintiffs while the agreement is in effect (except those claims that are already barred 
by any applicable statute of limitations). (Cottrell Decl. at \\ 22-23.) Plaintiffs entered a notice of voluntary dismissal without 
prejudice pursuant to Rule 41 (a) (1) (A) (i) of the Diaz-Federal action on June 29, 2020. (Id. at ¶ 24.) "

Dist. LEXIS 112362, 2014 WL 3956699, at *1 (W.D. Wash. Aug. 12, 2014) (""[T]his Court finds itself in need of such a standard 
and chooses to align itself with the emerging trend in other districts towards the adoption of a preponderance of the evidence

cite no Ninth Circuit authority that directs use of a preponderance standard in deciding class certification motions. Because that

1950,4," We acknowledge that Tyson Foods stated that once a district court finds representative evidence ""admissible, its 
persuasiveness is, in general, a matter for the jury,"" and class certification should only be denied if ""no reasonable juror"" could 
have found the plaintiffs' representative evidence persuasive. 136 S. Ct. at 1049. But that discussion was in the context of a 
wage-and-hour class action where representative evidence is explicitly permitted to establish liability in individual cases. Id. 
(citing Anderson v. Mt. Clemens Pottery Co., 328 U.S. 680, 687, 66 S. Ct. 1187, 90 L. Ed. 1515 (1946)). Such an evidentiary rule 
exists because defendants often fail to keep proper records of hours worked by employees. Id.; see also Lamictal, 957 F.3d at 
191-92 (discussing how representative evidence is particularly appropriate in wage-and-hour suits since ""a representative 
sample of employees may be the only feasible way to establish liability"" in a wage-and-hour case due to the defendant's own 
""inadequate record keeping""). Given that representative evidence can be used to infer harm in individual wage-and-hour suits, Tyson Foods reasoned that 
representative evidence was presumptively usable at the class certification stage as well. See Tyson Foods, 136 S. Ct. at 1049; 
see also id. at 1046 (stating that representative evidence can be used to establish predominance if ""each class member could 
have relied on that sample to establish liability if he or she had brought an individual action.""). But the ""no reasonable jury"" 
standard is cabined to wage-and-hour suits and doesn't apply here. See Senne v. Kan. City Royals Baseball Corp., 934 F.3d 
918, 923, 947 & n.27 (9th Cir. 2019) (""Tyson expressly cautioned that this rule should be read narrowly and not assumed to 
apply outside of the wage and hour context.""). "
1951,5," See, e.g., Douglas H. Ginsburg & Eric M. Fraser, The Role of Economic Analysis in Competition Law (May 16, 2010) (""[Courts] 
almost certainly will not have the assistance of even one staff economist, nor will the judges likely be familiar with the economic 
concepts about the application of which [the parties] are debating.""); Laurence H. Tribe, Trial by Mathematics: Precision and 
Ritual in the Legal Process, 84 Harv. L. Rev. 1329, 1342 n.40 (1971) (discussing how courts misunderstand and misapply 
statistical evidence); G. Alexander Nunn, The Incompatibility of Due Process and Naked Statistical Evidence, 68 Vand. L. Rev. 
1407 (2015) (discussing how the use of statistical evidence in certain circumstances can constitute a due process violation)."
1951,6," As Mark Twain famously popularized, ""[t]here are three kinds of lies: lies, damn lies, and statistics."" See Mark Twain, Chapters 
from My Autobiography—XX, 186 N. Am. Rev. 465, 471 (1907). Although we welcome the use of statistical evidence when 
appropriate, it would be injudicious to swallow it uncritically. "
1955,7," The presence of uninjured parties in a certified class also raises serious standing implications under Article III. The federal 
court system is reserved only for those that have suffered an injury. See Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 566, 112 S. Ct. 
2130, 119 L. Ed. 2d 351 (1992). To that end, standing requires each plaintiff provide ""a factual showing of perceptible harm."" Id. 
A class action should be no different. See Tyson Foods, 136 S. Ct. at 1053 (Roberts, C.J., concurring) (""Article III does not give 
federal courts the power to order relief to any uninjured plaintiff, class action or not.""). Accordingly, as the Fifth Circuit recently 
expressed, we are skeptical that Article III permits certification of a class where ""[c]ountless unnamed class members lack 
standing."" Flecha v. Medicredit, Inc., 946 F.3d 762, 768 (5th Cir. 2020). But we do not reach this issue because, as we lay out, 
class certification fails under Rule 23(b)(3), which is dispositive of the matter. In re Hyundai & Kia Fuel Economy Litig., 926 F.3d 
539, 565 n.12 (9th Cir. 2019)."
1955,8," HN19[
] Courts cannot relocate the predominance inquiry to the merits stage of the trial. Rule 23 requires this determination be made at the pretrial stage. And for good reason. Suppose the jury ultimately decides Defendants' expert is right and Plaintiffs' 
model sweeps in 28% uninjured class members. Too late: the damage has been done. By then, Defendants would have possibly 
weathered years of litigation at untold costs, only to discover that the case never should have reached the merits at all. Rule 23's 
objective—that only cases suitable for class adjudication be certified—would have been effectively undermined."

1956,12," The dissent also claims that we ignore Ninth Circuit case law. Dissent at 36. Not so. HN21[
] We agree with Torres v. Mercer Canyons Inc., 835 F.3d 1125, 1136 (9th Cir. 2016) that the mere presence of some non-injured class members does not defeat 
predominance, but we hold that the number of uninjured class members must be de minimis. As Torres stated, the ""existence of 
large numbers of class members"" who were never exposed to injurious conduct may defeat predominance. Id."
1956,13," This is over double the percentage of uninjured class members considered sufficient to defeat predominance in In re Rail 
Freight (12.7%), almost triple the percentage disapproved of in In re Asacol (10%), and around five times greater than the 
percentages at issue in the district courts cited (5-6%)."
1956,14," Compounding these concerns, the burden of persuasion may have been improperly shifted to Defendants to affirmatively 
disprove the claims made by Plaintiffs' expert. In certifying the classes, the district court reasoned that ""Defendants have not 
persuaded the Court that Dr. Mangum's model is unreliable."" Packaged Seafood, 332 F.R.D. at 326. Additionally, the district 
court concluded that the predominance requirement was met because Defendants had not shown that Plaintiffs' models were 
""glaringly erroneous."" Id. HN24[
] But the ""party seeking class certification has the burden of affirmatively demonstrating that the class meets the requirements of [Rule] 23."" Mazza v. Am. Honda Motor Co., 666 F.3d 581, 588 (9th Cir. 2012). "

334 F.3d 600, 604 (7th Cir. 2003)). But even assuming that academic literature does so ""abound,"" see Op. at 20, n.5, that 
doesn't establish that Article III judges in general, or the distinguished district judge in this case, are so easily fooled. The cited 
literature is, for better or worse, based on the observations of the authors, not on a rigorous scientific survey of the lack of 
knowledge of statistical theory by district judges (or even federal appellate judges). "
1959,2," Although the First Circuit has adopted a ""de minimis"" rule, it has defined it in ""functional terms,"" asking whether there is a 
""mechanism that can manageably remove uninjured persons."" Asacol Antitrust Litig., 907 F.3d at 53-54 (cleaned up). That rule 
corresponds in practical application to Ninth Circuit precedent. See Torres, 835 F.3d at 1137. "
