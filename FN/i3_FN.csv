confined to Parker immunity from Sherman Act claims and did not involve federal district court review of a state court decision. 
See generally Midcal, 445 U.S. 97, 100 S. Ct. 937, 63 L. Ed. 2d 233. "
29,4," Because all of Ramos's claims were barred on Rooker-Feldman and Parker immunity grounds, we decline to address Ramos's 
additional arguments concerning Eleventh Amendment immunity, and those arguments that do not involve the application of

exceptions of no cause of action, no right of action, and vagueness; and granted TIS an opportunity to amend its petition."
36,2," Prior to filing the petition for damages, TIS notified the Louisiana Department of Insurance of the defendants' alleged illegal 
actions. Some regulatory actions were taken against the defendants, the details of which are not pertinent to this appeal."

50,9," Plaintiffs are suspicious of the 16% figure since it perfectly aligns with the amount of electricity that Clinton and Quad Cities 
provide. [100] at 24:2-8. They believe that the fact that the legislature used the 16% figure instead of calculating a competitive 
environmental amount that is universally beneficial is further proof that this is not an ""open-ended program"" in which other plants 
can compete, but it is a subsidy for Clinton and Quad Cities. Id. at 24:2-8, 30:11-17."
50,10," The Illinois statute modeled the ZEC program on Renewable Energy Credit programs, which many states, including Illinois, 
have enacted. [38-3] ¶ 46; [1] ¶ 51; see also 20 ILCS 3855/1-75(c). Generally, under such programs, ""qualified renewable 
generators (such as solar, wind, and biomass) earn RECs for each MWh of electricity they generate,"" and retail suppliers ""are 
required to acquire a certain number of RECs each year or make an Alternative Compliance Payment."" [1] ¶ 51. All qualified

50,12," The market price index each delivery year is the sum of projected energy and capacity prices. 20 ILCS 3855/1-75(d-
5)(1)(B)(iii). Projected energy prices are calculated using the energy forward prices for each month of the applicable delivery 
year averaged for each trade date during the calendar year immediately preceding that delivery year. Id. § 1-75(d-
5)(1)(B)(iii)(aa). Projected capacity prices are calculated using the sum of fifty percent of the Base Residual Auction price, as 
determined by PJM, divided by twenty-four hours per day, and multiplied by fifty percent of the resource auction price, as 
determined by MISO's resource auction, divided by twenty-four hours per day. Id. § 1-75(d-5)(1)(B)(iii)(bb). PJM's Base 
Residual Auction is held each year during the month of May; it determines capacity obligations for a delivery year three years in 
advance. See RPM Base Residual Auction FAQs, PJM, available at https://www.pjm.com/~/media/markets-ops/rpm/rpm-

51,13," The baseline market price index for the consecutive twelve-month period ending May 31, 2016 is $31.40 per megawatt hour. 
20 ILCS 3855/1-75(d-5)(1)(B)(ii). This is based on the sum of the average of PJM's day-ahead energy auction price, fifty percent 
multiplied by the Base Residual Auction capacity price, as determined by PJM, divided by 24 hours per day, and fifty percent 
multiplied by the Planning Resource Auction capacity price, as determined by MISO, divided by 24 hours per day. Id."
51,14," At current wholesale prices, for every megawatt hour of energy the subsidized nuclear plants sell into the FERC-jurisdictional 
market, they will receive the locational price of energy (approximately $18 and $25 per MWh at Quad Cities and Clinton, 
respectively), plus a ZEC payment subsidy (approximately $16.50 in 2017, with possible increases in future years). [1] ¶ 7."
51,15," Commonwealth Edison Company, a subsidiary of Exelon, filed a proposed tariff modification with the ICC, which will allow 
Commonwealth Edison Company to bill all retail customers a ZEC charge of 0.195 cents per kilowatt hour beginning June 1, 
2017. 17-cv-1163, [65] at 2; [65-1]. One of the consumer plaintiffs has already received a bill for the ""Zero Emission Standard"" charge. 17-cv-1163, [70] at 2. "
52,16," See Lexmark International v. Static Control Components, 134 S. Ct. 1377, 1386, 188 L. Ed. 2d 392 (2014) (describing the 
""prudential"" label as misleading)."
52,17," ""The amount of the ZEC payment received by a generator will thus fluctuate between $0 and $16.50/MWh, depending on 
future wholesale energy and capacity prices in Illinois. A participating nuclear generator (i.e., Exelon) will receive no ZEC 
payments in a given delivery year if projected energy and capacity prices in Illinois rise above $47.90/MWh for that year (= 
$31.40 baseline market index + $16.50 SCC). Within these two bookends, the ZEC payment varies in a formulaic way based on 
current and projected wholesale energy and capacity prices."" [38-3] ¶ 39. "
54,18," One of the members of plaintiff EPSA is a nuclear plant in Pennsylvania, [38-3] at 47 n.93, and it claims that it is injured by not 
being able to receive ZECs. Although this allegation was not in the complaint, I do consider it. This entity is more likely to have 
an injury traceable to in-state favoritism, but it does not allege that it intends to seek ZECs or that it is in fact prohibited from 
participating in the ZEC procurement process. Its injury, then, is like the other generator plaintiffs'. It is harmed by the subsidy, 
whether or not that subsidy is awarded on the basis of in-state economic protectionism. Moreover, EPSA brings this action ""as 
an organization,"" see [1] ¶ 15 n.3, so this additional fact about one of its members does not change the organization's 
discrimination theory, and it remains true that the allegations in the complaint are insufficient to confer standing for the dormant 
commerce clause claims."
54,19," I do not reach Exelon's arguments that plaintiffs do not fall within the zone of interests of the dormant commerce clause. I note, 
however, that the consumer plaintiffs are not like the plaintiffs in Gen. Motors Corp. v. Tracy, 519 U.S. 278, 286, 117 S. Ct. 811, 
136 L. Ed. 2d 761 (1997). The plaintiffs in  [*23] Tracy were directly burdened by the challenged law. The consumer plaintiffs 
here are not the direct target of discrimination by the ZEC program; their activity in interstate commerce is not altered by Illinois's 
statute. The consumer plaintiffs also argue that since the ZEC program provides for an automatic pass-through of the costs, it 
harms the consumers and not the utilities, which are mere conduits. But, it does not follow from the automatic pass-through of 
costs that the utilities have no injury and no standing. See Bacchus Imports, Ltd. v. Dias, 468 U.S. 263, 267, 104 S. Ct. 3049, 82 
L. Ed. 2d 200 (1984) (wholesalers paying a discriminatory tax have standing to challenge the tax even though they pass the 
costs of the tax onto their customers). "
55,20," Exelon points out that some plaintiffs have already brought such a complaint to FERC. [53-1] at 35 n.12. FERC does not have 
a quorum, [91] at 2, so it is not surprising that plaintiffs look to the courts. But FERC's current paralysis does not change the 
structural limitations on judicial power. "
56,21," I nevertheless reach the merits of plaintiffs' preemption claims, in the event their claims can be read to seek a blanket 
injunction with no reference to the reasonableness of wholesale pricing."

57,25," 139 FERC ¶ 61061 (Apr. 20, 2012)."
57,26," The ZEC program does not expressly exclude any generators from applying. It describes a detailed bid selection process and 
the criteria that will be considered in that process, but plaintiffs do not explain how those or other provisions lead to the 
conclusion that the ZEC program does not apply broadly."
57,27," Defendants note that while plaintiffs argue that the statute's stated purpose was pretext, the complaint does not allege that the 
statute's true aim or purpose was to adjust or disregard wholesale rates. Instead, plaintiffs allege that its actual purpose was to 
save jobs and generate local tax revenues. See [1] ¶ 58. "
59,28," In these cases, the state effectively prohibited conduct that federal law authorized."
59,29," PJM ""is exploring"" ways to change its participation requirement to ""remove subsidized resources from the price formation 
process and thus accommodate state subsidies in a manner that might be acceptable to FERC and PJM's stakeholders."" [88] at 
12 n.6."
59,30," Plaintiffs argue that because Clinton is designated as an Exempt Wholesale Generator under the Public Utility Holding 
Company Act, 42 U.S.C. § 16451 et seq., it can only sell its electricity in MISO's wholesale auction. But, Clinton could forego its 
EWG status and seek ICC approval to sell its energy at retail, and then it would no longer be limited to selling its electricity in 
MISO's wholesale auctions."
59,31," See Allco, No. 16-2946, 2017 U.S. App. LEXIS 11484, 2017 WL 2782856, at *10 (rejecting a claim that a state program 
compelled wholesale transactions where the program directed certain contracts, but did not guarantee that the wholesale 
transaction would occur). "
61,32," Not surprisingly, Exelon was opposed to these kinds of subsidies until it was a beneficiary of them. See [83] at 37. That it has 
taken both sides of the policy debate over subsidies is irrelevant to whether the state-created market distortions at issue here 
conflict with federal regulations. There is no dispute that ZECs will affect the market and that Illinois has created a subsidy that 
favors certain participants in the wholesale auctions. The program, however, does not require auction clearing and does not 
prevent FERC from setting wholesale rates. Exelon's biases notwithstanding, Illinois is not in conflict with FERC."
61,33," Plaintiffs argue that the subsidies will stand as an obstacle to the federal plan for competitive wholesale auctions and that 
Illinois is doing indirectly what it cannot do directly—adjusting wholesale auction-clearing prices. See Int'l Paper Co. v. Ouellette, 
479 U.S. 481, 495, 107 S. Ct. 805, 93 L. Ed. 2d 883 (1987). But indirect effects are permissible under EPSA and Hughes, and, 
in my view, the proper articulation of the federal interest here is in setting just and reasonable wholesale rates. FERC can 
continue to use all the tools at its disposal to set just and reasonable rates, and the possible need to react to ZECs is not 
sufficient to amount to clear damage to wholesale rate-setting. "
62,34," Plaintiffs say that ""[the statute] directs the IPA to consider reports under House Resolution 1146,"" and one such report 
identifies the Clinton and Quad Cities plants as plants that will potentially close; this is relevant because preserving zero 
emission facilities is a factor in the ""public interest"" criteria of the bid selection process. [83] at 46. The same provision that 
plaintiffs draw on, however, directs the IPA to consider other reports, some of which, Exelon argues, are about out-of-state 
plants. 20 ILCS 3855/1-75(d-5)(1)(C). Considering such reports does not facially favor in-state plants. Additionally, the ICC and 
not the IPA selects the plants that will receive ZECs. Since the ICC may only consider three neutral environmental criteria—(1) 
""minimizing carbon dioxide emissions that result from electricity consumed in Illinois,"" (2) ""minimizing sulfur dioxide, nitrogen 
oxide, and particulate matter emissions that adversely affect the citizens of this State,"" and (3) ""the incremental environmental 
benefits resulting from the procurement,"" Id. § 1-75(d-5)(1)(C-5)(i)-(ii)—it does not discriminate based on a plant's geographic 
location."
62,35," [83] at 19 n.7 (citing S.A. 3, S.B. 1585, at 82-83, 99th Gen. Assemb. (Ill. May 12, 2016), available at

64,36, Available at http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/publicacts/99/099-0906.htm.
64,37," Because the complaints fail to state a claim, plaintiffs cannot show a likelihood of success on the merits and preliminary 
injunctive relief would not be appropriate. Courts usually give plaintiffs an opportunity to amend a complaint after a first 
dismissal. Here, however, the deficiencies in plaintiffs' claims cannot be cured with different allegations. These plaintiffs cannot 
pursue the legal theories they have articulated (or they do not have standing to do so). Therefore, I decline to give them leave to 
amend. "
66,1," The Court GRANTS Defendants' request to take judicial notice of the prior unpublished court opinions. (ECF No. 25-3.) 
Although not precedential, the reasoning is useful. The Court DENIES Defendants' request to take judicial notice of signs 
allegedly posted in Defendants' Westfield Mission Valley store on November 24, 2015. These signs are neither proper 
considerations for judicial notice nor appropriate for consideration in a Motion to Dismiss. See Hal Roach Studios, Inc. v. Richard 
Feiner & Co., 896 F.2d 1542, 1555 n.19 (9th Cir. 1990) (courts may not usually consider material outside the complaint when 
ruling on a motion to dismiss)."
66,2," Although at oral argument, Plaintiff's counsel also claimed to be representing a class of individuals allegedly misled by their 
purchases at the on-line stores, in fact, the TAC does not include this claim. (See TAC ¶ 10.) "
67,3," Plaintiff files three Notices of Supplemental Authority. (ECF Nos. 28, 31, 32.) All were decided after Plaintiff filed her Response 
in Opposition to the Motion to Dismiss. Defendants object to the Notice referencing Rubenstein (ECF No. 28), accurately 
pointing out that Plaintiff's notice includes argument on this authority without leave of the Court and without fair opportunity for 
rebuttal. (ECF No. 29.) The Court agrees. Plaintiff's Notice violates this Court's chambers rules which specifically direct that any 
supplemental authority ""may not include any argument in the notice."" (Standing Order for Civil Cases § 4F.) However, the Court 
held oral argument and both parties were given an opportunity to address the relevance of Rubenstein. Additionally, Defendants object that the case is unpublished and, therefore, non-precedential. Once again, the Court agrees but 
points out that the conclusions in Rubenstein are not novel and have been applied in differing factual scenarios. See, e.g., Wool 
v. Tandem Computers, Inc., 818 F.2d 1433, 1439 (9th Cir. 1987), overruled on other grounds Hollinger v. Titan Capital Corp., 
914 F.2d 1564, 1575 (9th Cir. 1990) (en banc) (allegations may pass Rule 9(b) muster if the matters are ""peculiarly within the 
opposing party's knowledge"" and ""the allegations are accompanied by a statement of the facts upon which the belief is 
founded.""). Therefore, Defendants' objections are overruled. "

price increase. "
88,3," The Court dismissed plaintiffs' claims against Ortho's parent company, Johnson & Johnson Health Care Systems. See Blood 
Reagents, 756 F. Supp. 2d at 633. "
115,1," The Court notes that Defendant C&S withdrew its Motion to Dismiss DPP Compl. on June 6, 2017 (ECF No. 248) by submitting 
a request to withdraw same. (ECF No. 394). Additionally, Defendant C&S withdrew its Motion to Dismiss IPP Compl. on June 
19, 2017 (ECF No. 309) by filing a withdrawal request. (ECF No. 398)."
115,2," This background is derived from DPP's Consolidated Amended Complaint (ECF No. 220 (""DPP Compl."")), Indirect Purchaser

on Civ. No. 17-384 (""Fl. Compl."")), all of which the Court must accept as true at this stage of the proceedings. See Alston v. 
Countrywide Fin. Corp., 585 F.3d 753, 758 (3d Cir. 2009). For purposes of brevity, the Court will cite to DPP Compl., so long as 
the allegations therein are consistent with any of the parallel complaints. "

120,17," Freight logical simply means the supplier that is closest to the customer, who thereby will have a lower bid due to the 
decreased cost of shipping. (DPP Compl. ¶ 106). "
122,18," For purposes of brevity, the Court will discuss a sample of these allegations. However, as noted in n. 1, supra, the Court 
accepts each instance as true for purposes of these motion. "
123,19," The Court is cognizant that the District of Columbia and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico are not states. However, the Court 
will refer to both as ""states"" for purposes of consistency throughout this discussion. "
127,20," The Court notes that both Defendants Ghazey and Sundbeck advance additional arguments in support of dismissal, which 
shall be addressed infra. "
128,21," The Goodyear Court also specified that while the ""[f]low of a manufacturer's products into the forum . . . may bolster an 
affiliation germane to specific jurisdiction . . . ties serving to bolster the exercise of specific jurisdiction do not warrant a 
determination that, based on those ties, the forum has general jurisdiction over a defendant."" Id. at 2855 (emphases in original). "
131,22," The Court notes that IPP are correct in their argument that Puerto Rico law does acknowledge that fraudulent concealment 
tolls a statute of limitations. See Rivera-Ramos v. Roman, 156 F.3d 276, 282 (1st Cir. 1998)(""Puerto Rico law would toll the 
statute of limitations if-because of active or fraudulent concealment-a reasonable person would not have been able to discovery 
the basis for the lawsuit."")"
131,23," Defendants also jointly assert a statute of limitations argument in favor of dismissing IPP's antitrust claim under Puerto Rico 
law. (ECF No. 306-1 at 27-28). Consistent with the analysis set forth in this subsection, the Court concludes that IPP's 
allegations of fraudulent concealment are sufficient to toll the statute of limitations. (IPP Compl. 185-90) Thus, the Court 
incorporates its reasoning herein to IPP's antitrust claim under Puerto Rico law. "
134,24," The Court notes that on June 6, 2017, Defendant C&S filed a Motion to Withdraw its Motion to Dismiss DPP Compl. (ECF No. 
394). Said Motion was granted by the Court on June 7, 2017. (ECF No. 397). Accordingly, DPP's claims against Defendant C&S 
shall proceed. The Court also notes that GCC Defendants and Defendant GEO have not moved to dismiss DPP Compl. for 
insufficiency of the allegations, but rather only based on their previously discussed bankruptcies. See supra at III.A; see also 
ECF Nos. 244-1, 251-1. Finally, the Court notes that no individual Defendant has moved to dismiss DPP Compl. Thus, only 
Corporate Defendants Southern and USALCO are presently moving to dismiss DPP Compl. "

142,27," The Court notes that there are no material differences between jurisdictions regarding the law of unjust enrichment. 
Accordingly, the Court's analysis is the same under New Jersey law. See Tele Aid, 257 F.R.D. at 58 (""While there are minor 
variations in the elements of unjust enrichment under the laws of the various states, those differences are not material and do 
not create an actual conflict.""). "

2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 185351, 2013 WL 7211833, at *2 n.4 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 17, 2013). Here, however, I permitted the plaintiffs to 
address this evidence in a sur-reply and, in any case, Forest's new evidence did not alter my analysis. "
150,4," As discussed above, in connection with the 2003 Consulting Agreements, even if Dr. Schneider had received confidential 
information, the agreements themselves make clear that such information is no longer confidential. (May 2003 Consulting 
Agreement, ¶ 6; December 2003 Consulting Agreement, ¶ 6). "
151,5," In its opening brief, Forest suggests that the ""appearance of impropriety"" is a sufficient reason to disqualify an expert. (Def. 
Memo. at 1). That is incorrect. Even in the case of attorney conflicts, ""[o]nly in rare cases is disqualification for the mere 
appearance of impropriety desirable."" Ghee v. Artuz, 285 F. Supp. 2d 328, 329 (E.D.N.Y. 2003) (quoting Blue Cross and Blue 
Shield of New Jersey v. Philip Morris, Inc., 53 F. Supp. 2d 338, 346 (E.D.N.Y. 1999)). And the standard for disqualification of 
experts is significantly less stringent than that for attorneys. See Grioli, 395 F. Supp. 2d at 13. To the extent that Forest intends to argue that the public interest favors disqualification, I disagree. Forest has failed to make the 
requisite showing on either prong of the test for disqualification. Moreover, insofar as my finding that there is no confidential 
relationship between Forest and Dr. Schneider is based on the 2003 Consulting Agreements and the June 2008 Letter, the 
public interest and judicial integrity both militate in favor of giving Forest and Dr. Schneider the benefit of their bargains (or, in the 
case of the June 2008 Letter, the absence of a bargain)."
151,6," The parties' accusations of gamesmanship (Plaintiffs' Memorandum in Opposition to Defendants' Motion to Disqualify Dr. Lon 
Schneider at 1-2; Reply at 1-2) are unhelpful. They did, however, result in submission of an interesting email in which Forest 
offered to withdraw its disqualification motion if the plaintiffs agreed not to refer to Dr. Schneider's prior work for Forest in the 
future or to the filing of the disqualification motion in any subsequent discovery disputes (Email of Heather McDevitt dated June 
23, 2017, attached as part of Exh. Q to Second McDevitt Decl.), a position that appears to be in tension with the company's 
claims that Dr. Schneider's alleged conflict of interest will cause them harm. "
152,7," Moreover, there is a protective order in place in this action, which can be used to protect against disclosure of confidential 
information."
152,8," The court also noted that the Delaware defendants would likely ""use the discovery process . . . to impeach [the expert] with his 
past work for Apotex."" Id. As should be clear, I disagree that disqualification is the appropriate remedy for that hazard and note 
that the Merck court did not appear to consider any less severe relief. I therefore would decline to follow this (non-binding) 
precedent. "

169,1," PMA responded by filing a suit in federal district court seeking to vacate the NLRB's decision. The district court granted 
summary judgment to PMA, but we reversed, concluding that the district court lacked jurisdiction to review the NLRB's decision. 
Pac. Mar. Ass'n v. NLRB, 827 F.3d 1203, 1213 (9th Cir. 2016). "
170,2," ICTSI, in its counterclaim, specifically alleged that (1) PMA, with the encouragement of ILWU, threatened ICTSI with daily fines 
of $50,000 for refusing to give the disputed reefer work to ILWU workers; (2) PMA threatened ICTSI with fines for initiating 
proceedings with the NLRB; (3) ILWU and PMA improperly used the Joint Committee to issue determinations before using the 
federal courts to enforce the collusive, illegal decisions issued by the Joint Committee; (4) ILWU and PMA discriminated against 
non-PMA members, as well as ICTSI, by the terms of the CBA granting some PMA members an exemption from provisions 
granting certain work to ILWU; (5) a PMA board member boycotted the Port of Portland over ICTSI's refusal to give the disputed 
reefer work to ILWU; (6) ILWU members engaged in slowdown activity at Terminal 6 even after the NLRB determined that ITCSI 
did not control the disputed reefer work; (7) ILWU and PMA filed sham lawsuits against ICTSI; (8) ILWU and PMA interfered in 
ICTSI's contractual relationship with the Port of Portland; (9) ILWU caused other unions to lose similar work in ports in 
Washington and San Francisco; (10) ILWU threatened third parties in other Oregon ports in order to gain access to 
longshoreman work; (11) ILWU violated the labor laws; and (12) ILWU and PMA used a jointly-run hiring hall to send inefficient 
and unqualified workers to ICTSI."
170,3," The related NLRB proceedings cited by the district court are Case Nos. 19-CC-87504, 19-CD-87505, 19-CC-82533, and 19-
CC-82744. The cases were consolidated for review by an administrative law judge. Int'l Longshore & Warehouse Union, AFL-
CIO, 363 N.L.R.B. No. 12, 2015 NLRB LEXIS 729. 2015 WL 5638153, at *2 (Sept. 24, 2015). On September 24, 2015, a three-
member panel of the NLRB affirmed the judge's decision that ILWU violated labor law by engaging in improper job actions 
against ICTSI and that ILWU must cease engaging in such activity. Id. A three-member panel of the NLRB affirmed another 
administrative law judge's decision in Case No. 19-CC-100903, concluding that ILWU had engaged in improper work slowdown 
activities at Terminal 6 against ICTSI. Int'l Longshore & Warehouse Union, AFL-CIO, 363 N.L.R.B. No. 47, 2015 NLRB LEXIS 
870, 2015 WL 7750748 (Nov. 30, 2015). ILWU filed petitions for review of both of these NLRB decisions with the United States Court of Appeals for the District of 
Columbia Circuit. Petitioners' Opening Brief at 3, Int'l Longshore & Warehouse Union v. NLRB, Nos. 15-1443, 16-1036 (D.C. Cir. 
Jan. 25, 2017) (discussing both petitions for review—the case challenging the Sept. 24, 2015 NLRB decision is referenced as 
Nos. 15-1344 and 15-1428 (D.C. Cir.)). The cases were consolidated for oral argument and are currently pending before the 
D.C. Circuit. Id. Proceedings in the instant case still before the district court remain stayed. "

agreement)."
171,5," HN3[
] ""We review dismissal of a complaint without leave to amend de novo."" Big Bear, 182 F.3d at 1101. HN4[
] ""All 
allegations of material fact are taken as true and construed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party."" Id. (quoting Cahill "
172,," v. Liberty Mut. Ins., 80 F.3d 336, 337-38 (9th Cir. 1996)). However, the party must allege ""enough facts to state a claim to relief 
that is plausible on its face."" Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007). ""A

amendment.'"" Big Bear, 182 F.3d at 1101 (quoting Dumas v. Kipp, 90 F.3d 386, 389 (9th Cir. 1996))."
172,6," ICTSI argues that ILWU and PMA waived the affirmative defense of Noerr-Pennington immunity. But this appeal followed ILWU 
and PMA's successful motion to dismiss ICTSI's antitrust counterclaim. Even assuming that Noerr-Pennington immunity is an 
affirmative defense—an assumption that may not be warranted—it would not be waived unless ILWU and PMA omitted it from 
their answer to ICTSI's counterclaim. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(c)(1); see also Bayou Fleet, Inc. v. Alexander, 234 F.3d 852, 861 
(5th Cir. 2000) (rejecting waiver argument where plaintiff ""knew Noerr-Pennington was a potential issue throughout most of the 
discovery process""). ILWU and PMA have not yet answered the antitrust counterclaim. "
173,7," The Joint Activity includes all of the allegations discussed above, such as ILWU and PMA agreeing to discriminate against 
ICTSI and other non-PMA employers by treating PMA members preferentially. Supra note 2; see also supra note 3 (discussing 
NLRB decisions concluding that ILWU violated labor law)."
173,8," For example, it includes allegations that ILWU and PMA entered into an illegal agreement to engage in secondary boycotts 
against ICTSI with the purpose of seizing work for ILWU. The NLRA, in § 8(e), prohibits ""hot cargo"" agreements, as well as 
secondary boycotts or agreements to not do business with third parties, between employers and unions. 29 U.S.C. § 158(e). "
174,9," The statutory labor exemption applies only where unions act unilaterally; therefore, it does not shield collective bargaining 
agreements from antitrust scrutiny. See United States v. Hutcheson, 312 U.S. 219, 231-32, 61 S. Ct. 463, 85 L. Ed. 788 (1941)."
174,10, See supra note 8. 
175,11," Whether one views suppressing competition in the labor market to benefit labor as a desirable policy depends on one's 
political preferences, but is not at issue in the instant case. See generally Alex Bryson, Union Wage Effects, IZA World of Labor 
2014:35 (July 2014), https://wol.iza.org/uploads/articles/35/pdfs/union-wage-effects.pdf (discussing the benefits and costs of 
labor unions with respect to their impact on the labor market); Ralph K. Winter, Jr., Collective Bargaining and Competition: The 
Application of Antitrust Standards to Union Activities, 73 Yale L.J. 14, 19 (1963). Congress has presumably exempted certain 
anticompetitive actions from antitrust scrutiny because it has determined that the social benefits of suppressing competition in 
the labor market sometimes outweigh the costs, and we must respect its decision. See, e.g., Brown, 518 U.S. at 242. "
177,12," When collective bargaining is undertaken in good faith, but labor and management reach an impasse as to terms covering 
wages, working conditions, and other mandatory terms of bargaining, the employer is allowed to impose its last, best offer 
without committing an unfair labor practice or violating the law. Brown, 518 U.S. at 238 (""Both the Board and the courts have 
held that, after impasse, labor law permits employers unilaterally to implement changes in pre-existing conditions, but only 
insofar as the new terms meet carefully circumscribed conditions.""). "
178,13," The Eighth Circuit concluded that the Supreme Court overruled Mackey in Brown. Eller, 731 F.3d at 754-55. However, this 
decision does not help ICTSI on the arm's-length question. Instead, Brown makes it easier for parties to argue their agreement is 
arm's-length—before Brown only union-employer agreements seemed to qualify for the nonstatutory exemption in NFL litigation, 
but now employer-only agreements qualify too (meaning employer-only agreements now qualify as arm's-length or such 
requirement no longer exists at all). Id."
178,14," Because the nonstatutory exemption covers all the Joint Activity in furtherance of the alleged conspiracy—including 
allegations that ILWU ""engaged in slowdowns, work stoppages, safety gimmicks"" and similar activities ""to force ICTSI to assign 
the disputed work to the ILWU""—we need not reach, and choose not to reach, the question of whether the district court erred in 
applying the statutory exemption to shield certain activity by ILWU from antitrust scrutiny. The wrongs dismissed under the 
statutory exemption by the district court are shielded from antitrust liability by the nonstatutory exemption. We also need not, and do not, reach the question of whether the district court erred by concluding that shared monopoly claims 
are not actionable under § 2. The dismissed § 2 claim is also barred by the nonstatutory exemption. See Brown, 518 U.S. at 235 
(discussing ""the 'nonstatutory' labor exemption from the antitrust laws"" (emphasis added)). "
179,15," ICTSI's motion for judicial notice is GRANTED. See Small v. Avanti Health Systems, LLC, 661 F.3d 1180, 1186 (9th Cir. 
2011). "

185,2," Martignetti's credit invoices specifically identify the quantity of promotional products the retailer purchased during the

185,3, The record is ambiguous as to whether retailers may opt to receive a cash payment in lieu of the future purchase credit. 
187,4," Although the Commission issued three separate decisions, the cited passage appears in each one."
187,5," The Commission has been enjoined by an order of preliminary injunction (Wilkins, J.) from enforcing the terms of this 
suspension pending the outcome of the present litigation."
187,6, Chapter 138 encompasses the statutory provisions that govern the Commonwealth's alcoholic beverage industry. 
188,7," In 1957, the Supreme Judicial Court held that G.L.c. §23A, which sought to apply the Commonwealth's Unfair Sales Act to the 
alcoholic beverage industry, had been impliedly repealed by the enactment of G.L.c. 138, 25C. See Bond Liquor Store, Inc., 336 
Mass. at 74. The SJC reasoned that ""the application of §23A to sales to which §25C also in terms applies would be so arbitrary 
and unreasonable . . . as to show inconsistency and repugnancy in their respective positions,"" and thus held that ""the intention to 
occupy the entire field of price control in the liquor industry is reasonably manifested by §25C."" Id. at 74, 77. For this reason, 
Total Wine's insistence that the Unfair Sales Act, G.L.c. 93, §14F, completely preempts 204 Code Mass. Regs. §2.04(1) is 
unavailing."
188,8," The Court does not credit the Commission's contention that Section 2.04(1) is to any meaningful degree designed to ensure 
that alcohol not be made overly available (through lower prices) to consumers."
188,9," Low retail prices for alcoholic beverage products are also essential to suppressing the criminal activity associated with illicit 
alcohol sales. See Report Made to His Excellency the Governor by a Special Commission Appointed by Him, 1933 MA H.B. 
1300 at 11 (March 16, 1933) (""When the law provides . . . for an abundant supply of good and pure beverages at reasonable 
prices, there can be no legitimate demand for a supply through illicit dealers""). See also Special Commission Established to 
Study the Laws and Regulations Governing the Alcoholic Beverage Industry in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Report to 
Governor Edward J. King at 1 (June 15, 1980) (""The consuming public deserves—not only the lowest possible price—but the 
widest possible choice among products, the most wholesome products available, and pricing which is fair and competative 
[sic]"")."
188,10," To mitigate this result, the Commission has taken the position that CQDs may be factored into the ""invoiced cost"" of a product 
after a documentary credit invoice is issued to the retailer. Rather than prevent unfair competitive practices, however, this 
interpretation of Section 2.04(1) creates an opportunity for larger alcoholic beverage retailers to employ trade practices that will 
place smaller competitors at a market disadvantage. For example, a national retailer could predictably purchase a large up-front 
quantity of a particular product to qualify for a CQD, and then wait until it receives a corresponding credit invoice before placing 
the item on shelves for sale. In this way, the retailer would be able to entice potential customers by offering the product at the "
189,," lowest possible price. By contrast, smaller retailers may not have the financial resources to purchase a large volume of products 
that will not immediately be placed in stores for sale. As a consequence, those retailers would be obliged to offer the product at a 
higher price than larger competitors that are able to afford to keep promoted products off of their shelves until they receive a 
credit invoice. Such an outcome—viz, enabling large retailers to exploit their superior resources to drive smaller competitors out 
of the market—is the very antithesis of the level playing field Section 2.04(1) seeks to foster. See Johnson, 374 Mass. at 792 
(HN15[
] Massachusetts alcohol regulation ""aims at . . . preserving the right of small, independent liquor dealers to do 
business""). "
190,11," It also bears noting that 204 Code Mass. Regs. §2.04 does not cite G.L.c. 138, §25C as the source of its regulatory authority. 
It cites, rather, to G.L.c. 138, §12 which concerns entities that hold a license to serve beverages to be consumed on premises, 
and §24, which speaks only to the Commission's authority to establish maximum prices."
190,12," Assuming, arguendo, that a CQD is more properly categorized as a ""credit"" than a ""discount,"" the Commission's position is 
unclear as to whether the application of such ""credit"" to a future original invoice may properly be considered when calculating 
that order's ""invoiced cost."""
190,13," The Court recognizes that the Commission's construction of Section 2.04(1) may have arisen out of the practical challenges it 
faces in enforcing a minimum price scheme. In other words, the burden on the Commission to investigate the ""invoiced cost"" of 
an alcoholic beverage product is arguably eased by limiting the ""invoiced cost"" to the total cost identified on the single originally 
invoiced document. Presently, HN20[
] Commission regulations prohibit retailers from accepting any invoices that ""contain any 
statement which falsely indicates prices, discounts, or terms of sale; nor . . . any statement which makes the invoice a false 
record, wholly or in part, of the transaction represented therein; nor . . . any statements which properly should be included 
therein, so that in the absence of such statements the invoice does not truly reflect the transaction involved."" 204 Code Mass. 
Regs. §2.02(2). The record, however, suggests that wholesalers' original invoices in fact meet the requirements of this regulation 
with respect to CQDs by simply incorporating by reference the terms of the promotional pricing published in the Massachusetts 
Beverage Journal. In all events, the Commission is empowered to modify or add to its regulations—with prospective effect "
191,," only—if a retailer's incorporation of CQDs by reference inadequately apprises the agency of the discounts applicable to a 
determination of ""invoiced cost."" See G.L.c. 138, §24. This would be far more consistent with regulatory fairness than the novel 
construction of ""invoiced cost"" ABCC has imposed on Total Wine post hoc in the case at bar"
191,14," To be sure, Total Wine is not the paradigmatic small retailer of which the Court speaks. But it is part of a regulated industry 
that has a right to expect that the statute which governs its business conduct will be construed by the enforcement agency in a 
manner that is predictable, fair, and consistent with the purposes of the law. That expectation has been frustrated in the present 
case."
191,15," Total Wine additionally argues that the Commission's construction of 204 Code Mass. Regs. §2.04(1) renders the regulation 
an unreasonable restraint on trade, in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act, 15 U.S.C. §1 et seq. However, inasmuch as the 
Court has found that the Commission's construction and application of its regulation were impermissibly arbitrary and capricious, 
there is no need to engage in an analysis of whether such actions offend federal antitrust law. "
196,1," The Noerr-Pennington doctrine draws its name from the United States Supreme Court opinions in Eastern Railroad Presidents 
Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 81 S. Ct. 523, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464 (1961), and United Mine Workers of 
America v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 85 S. Ct. 1585, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626 (1965), and provides that those who petition the 
government for redress are generally afforded immunity unless the action is objectively baseless. "
197,2," The summary judgment motion was heard in the Law Division by the Presiding Judge of the Chancery Division (herein the 
Chancery Judge)."
197,3," Plaintiffs allege the Ammons defendants are members of Wakefern, a retailer-owned food cooperative, and own and operate a 
number of ShopRite supermarkets in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. "
199,4, 15 U.S.C.A. §2. 
200,5," The motion judge's passing reference to our opinion noted only that it was a ""substantive [d]ecision"" and the panel ""did take 
their time in making the determination."" "
206,1," The following background facts are derived from plaintiff's second amended complaint (dkt. #95), undisputed representations in 
the parties' submissions regarding the motions to transfer and proceedings to date in the Northern District of Illinois."
206,2," Containerboard is a material composed of linerboard (a ""flat wood-fiber paperboard"") and a corrugated medium made out of 
the same material as linerboard that is fluted and laminated, which are combined to make sheets that can be formed into 
products such as boxes and other containers. (Second Am. Compl. (dkt. #95) ¶ 29.)"
206,3," Defendant Georgia-Pacific LLC asserts that it ""is a holding company separate from the GP operating businesses that actually 
produce or sell linerboard, medium, containerboard, or containerboard products,"" and offers that ""it is prepared to make 
appropriate arrangements with Plaintiff's counsel for the substitution of the proper GP operating entities as defendants,"" but the 
parties treat Georgia-Pacific LLC as a proper defendant for purposes of the instant motions, and so will the court. (Def.'s 
Opening Br. (dkt. #73) at 1 n.1.)"
206,4," Although defendant Georgia-Pacific does not join in the motion to transfer, the court refers to ""defendants"" for ease of 
reference, differentiating as to Georgia-Pacific only with respect to its separate motion to sever and transfer to the District of 
Delaware based on a forum selection clause. "
207,5," Plaintiff would argue that defendants' citations of the number of discovery disputes and hearings is somewhat misleading, since 
Judge Shadur ""oversaw the first two years of that case,"" (Pl.'s Opp'n Br. (dkt. #96) at 10), but defendants highlight that Judge 
Leinenweber has ""handled all motions"" since Magistrate Judge Nolan retired in late 2012. (Defs.' Opening Br. (dkt. #79) at 12 
n.7.) They further underscore that since late 2012, Judge Leinenweber ""has presided over multiple motions to compel, numerous 
status hearings, a motion to amend the pleadings, settlement of certain defendants, and class certification."" (Defs.' Reply Br. 
(dkt. #102) at 7 n.3.) "
208,6," Georgia-Pacific's argument that the other defendants lack standing to ""challenge the enforceability of [its] forum selection 
clause with Ashley"" (Def.'s Reply Br. (dkt. #103) at 7) is fruitless, since they do not challenge the clause's enforceability, but 
rather whether it should control over the other factors that they and plaintiff raise. In addition, the various authorities Georgia-
Pacific cites in support of its argument are inapposite, since defendants are not purporting to raise improper venue arguments on 
behalf of Georgia-Pacific. "
210,7," In fairness, that claim may be winding down with the defendants there, save Georgia-Pacific, and the class having a conditional 
settlement approved by the court, and Georgia-Pacific awaiting a ruling on its motion for summary judgment as the lone non-
settling defendant remaining. "
211,8," As plaintiff points out, one of the cases on which Georgia-Pacific relies heavily, Paduano, is easily distinguishable. In that case, 
the district court noted that ""unlike in Aquila, the decision whether to grant or deny the motion to sever and transfer, by itself, will 
have a marginal impact on judicial economy,"" because it was ""duty-bound to refer [the plaintiff's] claims [against the remaining 
defendants] to arbitration."" Paduano, 55 F. Supp. 3d at 435."
211,9," Although the court addresses each factor separately, it keeps in mind the Seventh Circuit's instruction that ""[§ 1404(a)] permits 
a 'flexible and individualized analysis' and affords district courts the opportunity to look beyond a narrow or rigid set of 
considerations in their determinations."" Research Automation, 626 F.3d at 978 (quoting Stewart, 487 U.S. at 29). "
212,10," While the latter cannot be helped, the court views much of the retention of separate, local counsel for each defendant as a 
largely self-inflicted cost, even in a conspiracy case, since federal law will largely control, existing counsel for each defendant 
can continue to provide independent representation and the role of attorneys ""on the ground"" is of little value, except to advise of 
local court procedures."
212,11," Even plaintiff's counsel located in Kansas City would likely find Chicago more convenient for this reason, and those in 
Milwaukee would find it a wash at best given the availability of train service."
212,12," Unlike § 133.03, which essentially adopts the elements of an illegal antitrust conspiracy in the Sherman Act, plaintiff correctly 
points out that the civil remedies in § 133.14 differ in some material respects from its federal counterpart, but those differences 
are not so unique or significant to tilt the consolidation of these cases either way. "
214,13," The third company, WestRock RKT Company, which filed a motion to dismiss plaintiff's claims against it in this case (dkt. 
#119), does not appear to be a defendant in Kleen [**28]  Products. "

219,2," On a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, the Court must limit itself to facts stated in the complaint or in documents 
attached as exhibits or incorporated by reference; the Court may also consider matters of which judicial notice may be taken 
under Federal Rule of Evidence 201. Kramer v. Time Warner, Inc., 937 F.2d 767, 773 (2d Cir. 1991). The parties have supplied the Court with voluminous documents cited in the SACs. These are attached as exhibits to the 
declarations of John S. Playforth, Dkt. 161, Stacey Anne Mahoney, Dkts. 167, 207, and Michael J. Garvey, Dkt. 171. A court 
may consider materials where incorporated by reference or ""integral"" to the SACs, see Chambers v. Time Warner, Inc., 282 F.3d 
147, 152-53 (2d Cir. 2002), materials ""that the plaintiffs either possessed or knew about and upon which they relied in bringing 
the suit,"" Rothman v. Gregor, 220 F.3d 81, 88-89 (2d Cir. 2000) (citation omitted), and materials that are matters of public 
record, Pani v. Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield, 152 F.3d 67, 75 (2d Cir. 1998). As discussed later, the parties dispute whether the Court can consider statements embedded in these materials for the truth of 
the matters asserted therein. See infra IV.B.2. For avoidance of doubt, the only materials upon which the Court has relied are 
those cited herein. "

222,7," See also Clearing Requirements Rule at 74,323 (""In order to comply with required clearing under this adopting release, market 
participants are likely to face certain startup and ongoing costs relating to technology and infrastructure, new or updated legal 
agreements, ongoing fees from service providers, and costs related to collateralization of their positions""); Dealer Mem. at 8 n.10 
(citing and quoting buy-side comment letters). "
224,8," Plaintiffs allege that the other dealers originally did not allow Barclays to participate in the Tradeweb consortium because ""they 
had placed Barclays in the 'penalty box' for attempting to launch a dealer-to-client IRS electronic trading platform without the 
other dealers' permission. When Barclays' ""penalty"" expired, plaintiffs allege, the Dealers allowed it, in 2009, to join other dealers 
in taking what they described as a ""minority equity stake"" in the business. SAC ¶ 124. "
225,9," The SACs also allege generally that the heads of trading desks at the Dealer Defendants ""maintained an ongoing dialogue"" 
through emails and text messages and thereby discussed their mutual desire to maintain the status quo. SAC ¶ 158. "
233,10," Unless otherwise specified, docket references herein refer to the docket in No. 16-MC-2704, the ""master case"" docket which 
has been established for filings of significance in this case, Dkt. 2, which is intended to encompass motions to dismiss and 
associated filings. The Court cites to No. 16-MD-2704 for filings not made in the master docket."
233,11, BNPP and UBS did not file separate briefs but at argument pursued dismissal on individual grounds. 
236,12," The SAC alleges one instance of a threat, during 2007-2012, to threaten to punish an IDB platform for opening access to the 
buy side. In 2009, GFI Group (""GFI""), an operator of leading IDB platforms, ""attempted to implement anonymous trading 
protocols on its platform,"" but this bid was ""immediately shut down by the Dealer Defendants,"" who ""responded in unison with 
threats to pull their business off the platform,"" leading GFI to ""reverse course."" SAC ¶ 161. The SAC does not elaborate on this 
claim. It does not name any Dealer or specify any threat. Id."
236,13," The SAC alleges that in 2008, the CME introduced plans to introduce a clearing product called ""CME Cleared Swaps"" to all 
OTC swaps (including for IRSs) executed on its trading platform, Swapstream. SAC Ini 184-85. It alleges that ""the Dealer 
Defendants viewed this as a serious threat to lead to central clearing because CME had built successful clearinghouses and 
exchanges for other asset classes."" Id. ¶ 186-88. The SAC alleges that ""[t]he Dealer Defendants responded to this threat by 
boycotting Swapstream"" and ""agreed to clear only interdealer IRS trades and only on SwapClear (the entity they controlled),"" 
and that as a result, ""CME's clearing solution for IRS swiftly failed."" Id. (emphases in original). "
237,14," See, e.g., SAC ¶¶ 96, 212 (acknowledging that collateral must be posted to secure cleared trades). The CFTC has recognized 
the substantial costs associated with payment of clearing fees and posting of collateral to secure cleared trades. See Clearing 
Requirements Rule at 74,323."
237,15," Given the lack of central clearing, the Dealers' common use of ""name give-up"" before 2013 is an unpersuasive basis from 
which to infer collusion: Before central clearing, disclosure of the buy-side name was a necessary incident to the trading 
process—a means of determining a counterparty's creditworthiness—as plaintiffs acknowledge. SAC ¶ 292. "
239,16," The SAC does not allege that two Dealer Defendants—BNPP and HSBC—participated in Project Fusion or invested in 
Tradeweb. SAC ¶ 15."
239,17," The SAC does not allege that Tradeweb was an unattractive investment opportunity, such that only one with conspiratorial 
aims would have invested in it. Supporting the inference of legitimacy, the SAC alleges that (1) the Dealers invested $280 million 
in Tradeweb; (2) they owned Tradeweb alongside existing owner Thomson; (3) Tradeweb, post-acquisition, was organized 
consistent with customary corporate formalities; (4) Tradeweb proceeded to expand other aspects of its trading platform; and (5) 
its decision not offer an all-to-all IRS trading platform until 2013 put it on par with all other trading platforms of the day, including 
non-defendants Tera, Javelin, TrueEx, and Bloomberg. See generally SAC ¶¶ 115-25, 142-50; see also Twombly, 550 U.S. at 
559 (declining to draw inference of conspiracy where company decides not to ""enter[] every market that an outside observer 
might regard as profitable.""). "
240,18," A burden-shifting framework drives the rule-of-reason analysis: [T]he plaintiffs bear an initial burden to demonstrate the defendants' challenged behavior had an actual adverse effect on 
competition as a whole in the relevant market. . . . Because the antitrust laws protect competition as a whole, evidence that 
plaintiffs have been harmed as individual competitors will not suffice. . . . If the plaintiffs satisfy their initial burden, the 
burden shifts to the defendants to offer evidence of the pro-competitive effects of their agreement. . . . Assuming 
defendants can provide such proof, the burden shifts back to the plaintiffs to prove that any legitimate competitive benefits 
offered by defendants could have been achieved through less restrictive means. . . . Ultimately, the factfinder must engage 
in a careful weighing of the competitive effects of the agreement—both pro and con—to determine if the effects of the 
challenged restraint tend to promote or destroy competition. MLB Properties, 542 F.3d at 317 (quoting Geneva Pharms. Technology Corp. v. Barr Labs. Inc., 386 F.3d 485, 506-07 (2d Cir. 
2004))."
240,19," With respect to the entire nine-year period covered by the SAC, plaintiffs appear to pursue a per se theory of § 1 liability, see, 
e.g., Class Mem. at 5, although the SAC, in its charging language, states summarily that defendants' alleged agreement was 
unlawful per se and under the rule of reason. SAC ¶ 396. As to the years 2013-2016, the allegation of a horizontal boycott of 
three new trading platforms describes a recognized type of per se illegal conduct. But for 2007-2012, the SAC, whether as to 
Project Fusion or in its limited other allegations, does not allege this type—or any other—of per se illegal conduct. In 2007, there 
was no all-to-all IRS platform to boycott. There would not be such a platform for another six years. (Revealingly, when 
questioned at argument as to what the Dealers were purportedly boycotting before 2013, plaintiffs' counsel replied: ""The buy 
side."" Tr. 72-73.) At argument, plaintiffs separately argued that Project Fusion might be subject to condemnation under an intermediate ""quick 
look"" analysis. Tr. 65. The limited facts pled regarding Tradeweb's strategic direction following the Dealers' acquisition of control, 
however, make it impossible, even on a quick look, to balance the pro-competitive benefits and anti-competitive harms, of that 
course. The Court is therefore unable to so condemn Project Fusion. See MLB Properties, 542 F.3d at 317 (rejecting ""quick-
look"" analysis as inappropriate for challenge to joint venture marketing activity where arrangement ""might plausibly be thought to 
have a net pro-competitive effect, or possible no effect at all on competition""); see also In re Insurance Brokerage Antitrust Litig., 
616 F.3d at 318 (rejecting ""quick look"" argument). "
242,20," Defendants cite extensively to buy-side firms' submissions before the CFTC to the effect that these firms often favored RFQ 
trading, were concerned about the costs and collateral outlays associated with mandatory central clearing, and believed that 
RFQ trading and individualized negotiations over trade terms—particularly as to customized IRS trades—would often yield better 
pricing than exchange trading. See, e.g., Dealer Mem. at 7 nn.7-8, 8 n.10, 9 n.15, 11 nn.22-23, 12 nn.24-27, 13 n.28. The Court 
has not relied on these materials. Had the Court done so, these would have reinforced that mandatory central clearing did not 
enjoy universal buy-side support and that this trading infrastructure, before Dodd-Frank, was not viewed as imminent. "
243,21," As to the two remaining platforms: The SACs allege that Dealer-owned Tradeweb was a coconspirator. They do not allege 
that Bloomberg's platform was an object of the Dealer boycott."
243,22," Plaintiffs also claim to have alleged direct evidence. They claim that the monthly meetings among Dealers' Strategic 
Investment Groups between 2013 and 2015, and other communications among Dealers, were used to coordinate positions 
regarding the IRS market. See, e.g., JTSAC ¶¶ 127, 280, 327. The allegations as to the content of these meetings are too 
general and conclusory, however, to qualify as direct evidence of an illegal agreement. "
245,23," Plaintiffs argue that refraining from trading on the new platforms was irrational conduct for a Dealer, because each had an 
""individual interest"" in participating in the startup markets to gain a ""first mover advantage."" SAC ¶¶ 342-44; JTSAC ¶¶ 376-77. 
The SACs, however, do not plead concrete facts suggesting that a Dealer took any material risk by sitting tight and waiting to 
see if the new platforms attracted sufficient support to survive. See SAC ¶ 273 n.102 (participation of only ""a smaller number of 
dealers"" would not be enough to sustain an all-to-all platform)."
245,24," The SACs do not allege any other means by which the four Dealers would have learned, by June 16, 2014, of the June 13, 
2014 trade. At argument, the Court inquired whether the trade had been publicly reported by June 16 so as potentially to have 
become known to the Dealers ""absent communication among them."" See Tr. 18, 100, 130. In a post-argument letter, defendants 
asserted that a subscription service called ""SEFView"" that took effect in February 2014 daily reported SEF trading, including on 
Tera's platform. Dkt. 223. In letter responses, plaintiffs countered that the Dealers' letter was tardy and improperly invited the 
Court to consider extrinsic evidence. Dkts. 224-25. The information reported about SEFView does not undermine the inference of coordination among the four Dealers. Even 
assuming that BNPP, Citi, J.P. Morgan, and UBS each subscribed to the SEFView service and accessed it and spotted the Tera 
trade before each contacted Tera on June 16—and there is no cognizable evidence of any of this—the Dealers' 
contemporaneous and similar calls to Tera would still suggest coordination among them. "
247,25," The SACs allege that a putative class action was filed against many of the same defendants alleging § 1 violations in 
connection with the credit default swaps (CDS) market; that these claims largely survived a motion to dismiss, see In re CDS, 
2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 123784, 2014 WL 4379112, at *9-13; and that there were regulatory investigations of the CDS market. 
See SAC ¶¶ 348-56; JTSAC ¶¶ 380-89. In sustaining plaintiffs' claims as to 2013-2016, the Court has disregarded these 
allegations. The civil claims did not result in any findings or admissions of liability; in any event, the civil claims involving CDSs 
are materially different from those here involving IRSs; and the regulatory investigations were closed without adverse findings. 
See In re Commodity Exch., Inc., Gold Futures and Options Trading Litig., 213 F. Supp. 3d 631, 661-62 (S.D.N.Y. 2016) 
(""Commodity Exch.""); see also In re Elevator Antitrust Litig., 502 F.3d at 51-52 (discounting allegations of anti-competitive 
conduct by same defendants in Europe as irrelevant; court rejects claim that ""if it happened there, it could have happened 
here"")."
247,26," The Court similarly disregards the complaints' characterizations of defendants' behavior as a ""boycott,"" ""conspiracy,"" ""cartel,"" 
and ""illegal agreement."" See, e.g., SAC ¶¶ 4, 5, 13, 19, 20, 22, 28, 30, 81, 163, 202, 206, 208-09, 244, 278, 282, 286. These 
labels are legal conclusions. See, e.g., Twombly, 550 U.S. at 561; Citigroup, 709 F.3d at 135-36."
247,27, The SAC is 144 pages. The JTSAC is 134 pages. 
250,28," The Court has used ""2013"" as shorthand to capture the start of the plausibly-pled conspiracy. Today's decision does not, of 
course, pinpoint when in 2013 the alleged conspiracy began. Conceivably, too, discovery may show that, if there was a 
conspiracy, it began later than 2013."
250,29," As to the remaining Dealer Defendants, the Court, following careful review of the SACs, has found sufficient factual allegations 
linking each to the group boycott conspiracy."
250,30," Plaintiffs urge the Court to apply an incorrect standard to this issue—that ""once a conspiracy is shown, only slight evidence is 
needed to link another defendant with it."" Apex Oil, 822 F.2d at 257. The Second Circuit has repudiated that formulation as 
inaccurately describing the burden of proof in conspiracy cases. Huezo, 546 F.3d at 186 & n.2. "
251,31," For purposes of this discussion, the Court assumes arguendo, with UBS, that the fact that it opposed ""name give-up""—a fact 
based on materials attached to the SACs—is cognizable on this motion."
251,32," HSBC is also not alleged to have had a stake in Tradeweb, on which plaintiffs' (nowdismissed) claims of a pre-2013 
conspiracy centered. "
252,33," Although not necessary to this ruling, ICAP has submitted documentation that in fact its SEFs, consistent with their impartial 
access rules reviewed and approved by the CFTC, are all-to-all platforms open to buy-side participation. See ICAP Mem. at 3 
(exhibit citations omitted). "
253,34," In its rule-making process, the CFTC expressly allowed platforms to use post-trade name giveup. See 78 Fed. Reg. 33,476, 
33,499 (June 4, 2013); id. at 33,567 (giving SEFs operational ""flexibility,"" including name give-up, to ""improve the efficiency, 
competitiveness, and financial integrity of the swaps market""). The CFTC approved ICAP's SEF, including its post-trade name 
give-up protocol. See ICAP Mem. at 9 (exhibit citation omitted). "
254,35," Because plaintiffs acknowledge that Tradeweb SEF was accessible to the buy side, plaintiffs' complaint that a Tradeweb 
platform was functionally inaccessible to the buy side appears to relate to its Dealerweb SEF, which allowed anonymous trading 
but which plaintiffs claim was functionally inaccessible to the buy side due to its cost. Compare JTSAC ¶ 316 with id. ¶ 318. In 
contrast, plaintiffs' complaint that a platform did not allow non-anonymous IRS trading appears to relate to the Tradeweb SEF."
254,36," All defendants but HSBC and Morgan Stanley were named in the original complaint. Those defendants were added on 
February 25, 2016; they argue that claims predating February 25, 2012 are time-barred. "
256,37," To the extent plaintiffs' claims for the pre-2012 period separately involve OTCDerivNet, the Dealers' control of that joint 
venture, dating to the early 2000s, was also public knowledge. See, e.g., Dealer Mem at. 74 n.88 (exhibit citation omitted)."
256,38," Class plaintiffs based their initial Complaint, like the SAC, on voluminous news articles and other public sources, many 
published well before November 25, 2011. This too supports a finding that plaintiffs were on inquiry notice, as a plaintiff may not 
""simultaneously claim that the generalized evidence cited as the basis of its complaint—the vast majority of which involves 
factual allegations published prior to the [limitations period]—is insufficiently detailed to state a cognizable claim for relief and 
that, nevertheless, these facts were insufficiently particular to cause the statute of limitations to run."" Woori Bank v. Merrill Lynch, 
923 F.Supp. 2d 491, 497 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (dismissing complaint as time-barred where it relied on ""extensive publicly available 
information"" to support its claims), aff'd, 542 F. App'x 81 (2d Cir. 2013). "
257,39," In light of this holding and the dismissal of the pre-2013 claims for failure to state a claim, the Court has no occasion to reach 
defendants' alternative argument that class plaintiffs have not alleged an injury-in-fact with respect to the pre-2013 period."
257,40," It clearly does. ""Generally, when consumers, because of a conspiracy, must pay prices that no longer reflect ordinary market 
conditions, they suffer 'injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent.'"" Gelboim, 823 F.3d at 772 (quoting 
Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-OMat, Inc., 429 U.S. 477, 489, 97 S. Ct. 690, 50 L. Ed. 2d 701 (1977)). "
260,41," ""Plain vanilla,"" of course, is not a defined term (at least in the context in which it is used here). The Court expects that in 
discovery, the parties will give due attention to the characteristics of IRS trades (e.g., their terms and the necessary number of 
like-termed bids or offers pending during a given time period) to make them suitable for exchange trading. "
275,1," The members are Eastside For Hire, Inc., Lyft, Inc., and Uber Technologies, Inc. These companies fall within the definition of 
""driver coordinator"" as that term is used in the Ordinance."
275,2," On May 3, 2017, the City appealed the temporary restraining order. At oral argument, plaintiffs requested that the Court defer 
ruling on the motion to dismiss until the Ninth Circuit resolves the appeal. The standards governing the appellate court's review 
of a preliminary order are not the same as those applied to a motion to dismiss, however. Because there is only a small chance 
that the appeal will resolve any of the issues raised in defendant's motion, the request for a stay or continuance is denied. "
277,3, The City's ripeness argument is considered below. 
278,4, RCW 81.72.200 relates to privately operated taxicab transportation services and contains the same antitrust language. 
279,5," Plaintiffs rely on a number of cases in which the delegating statute did not explicitly permit the displacement of competition. 
See Dkt. # 52 at 18 and 20. In those circumstances, the Court must determine ""if suppression of competition is the 'foreseeable 
result' of what the statute authorized."" Omni Outdoor Advertising, 499 U.S. at 373. In this case, anti-competitive results were not 
merely foreseeable, they were expressly authorized. "
280,6," In a slightly different context, Judge Chen of the Northern District of California rejected Uber Technologies' argument that it is 
purely a technology company, not a transportation company. O'Connor v. Uber Techs., Inc., 82 F. Supp.3d 1133 (N.D. Cal. 
2015). Judge Chen concluded that Uber's focus ""on the mechanics of its platform (i.e., the use of internet enabled smartphones 
and software applications) rather than on the substance of what Uber actually does (i.e., enable customers to book and receive 
rides)"" is unduly narrow, that ""Uber is most certainly a transportation company, albeit a technologically sophisticated one,"" and 
that ""Uber's own marketing bears this out, referring to Uber as 'Everyone's Private Driver,' and describing Uber as a 
'transportation system' and the 'best transportation service in San Francisco.'"" Id. at 1141-42. "
281,7," The 2015 statute that plaintiffs raised for the first time at oral argument does not change this analysis. The Commercial 
Transportation Services Act imposes upon companies such as Uber and Lyft the primary obligation to secure for its drivers an 
automobile insurance policy that covers the app-based commercial transportation services they provide. RCW 48.177.010. The 
statute itself recognizes, however, that the required coverage may already be in place under the purview of RCW Ch. 46.72: if 
that is the case, no additional coverage is needed. HN14[
] Nothing in the 2015 statute suggests that a ""commercial 
transportation service provider"" required to purchase insurance under the new law is not also subject to regulation as part of the 
""privately owned for hire transportation services"" network under RCW Ch. 46.72. The ambiguous statement in the legislative 
staff synopsis of the 2015 law is not part of the legislation, is not a statement of legislative intent, and cannot alter the meaning 
or circumscribe the reach of prior legislative enactments."
281,8," The Court rejects plaintiffs' argument that the state must supervise municipal programs in order to preserve state immunity. 
None of the cases identified by plaintiffs requires that result, nor is there any indication that the City of Seattle would have the 
power or authority to compel a state actor to fill the roles assigned to the Director under the Ordinance. Plaintiffs' interpretation of 
the ""state supervision"" requirement would result in situations where, despite a clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed 
state policy to allow municipalities to displace competition in a particular market, non-sovereign agencies and local governments 
would be barred from regulating in compliance with state law because they could not satisfy the state supervision requirement. 
Such an interpretation would eviscerate Parker and has no support in the case law. "
283,9," In its reply memorandum, defendant argues that the Court should decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state 
law claims if the federal causes of action are dismissed. The Court will not consider an argument first raised in reply."
283,10," In the specific factual context of this case, an express statutory exemption may also apply. Pursuant to RCW 19.86.170, 
""labor"" is not an article of commerce for purposes of the CPA. Thus, the collusive organization of labor for purposes of collective 
bargaining does not violate the Act. "
284,11," The Chamber's Garmon claim would fail for lack of standing even if the employee/independent contractor issue had been 
properly raised in this litigation. Plaintiffs would then have the burden of putting forth enough evidence to enable the Court to find 
that the Board could reasonably conclude that for-hire drivers are employees subject to the protections and prohibitions of the 
NLRA. Davis, 476 U.S. at 395. Whether a driver is an employee or an independent contractor depends on the details of the 
relationship between a specific driver coordinator and its drivers, including numerous factors such as the degree of control the 
coordinator exercises. See NLRB v. United Ins. Co. of Am., 390 U.S. 254, 256, 88 S. Ct. 988, 19 L. Ed. 2d 1083 (1968). The 
driver coordinators' participation in this litigation would then be necessary to ensure that the preemption analysis proceeds on 
actual facts regarding a coordinator's operations and relationship with its drivers rather than some stylized amalgam arising from 
the industry at large. Based on the evidence provided in the preliminary injunction context, it appears that the operations and 
relationships experienced by Eastside drivers varies significantly from those who drive for Lyft. Because the participation of its 
individual members is required, the Chamber lacks associational standing to pursue the Garmon preemption claim. Hunt, 432 
U.S. at 343. "
285,12," The Chamber also argues that the Ordinance conflicts with Congress' choice to leave the actual negotiations and adoption of 
working conditions to the parties, without government interference. If, however, the NLRA does not apply because for-hire 
drivers are independent contractors, the right to bargain collectively and the procedures through which that right is exercised will 
be determined by state law, as is the case with public employees and agricultural workers. "
287,13," HN30[
] Strict construction is also not appropriate where a municipal corporation is acting in a proprietary capacity and 
operating a business enterprise (such as a water or electric utility) for the private advantage of the municipality. See Branson v. 
Port of Seattle, 115 Wn. App. 695, 698 n.3, 63 P.3d 830 (2003). "
288,14," Once the driver list is produced to the QDR, it is likely that it will be transmitted to the City in order to show that a majority of 
qualifying drivers from the list supplied a statement of interest. At that point, the list will become a public record subject to the 
PRA. To the extent a request for disclosure is made under the PRA and the Chambers' members hope to preclude further 
disclosure of the list, they will have to use the third-party injunction procedures set forth in the act. RCW 42.56.540. "
290,1," The Court finds this matter appropriate for disposition without oral argument and the matter is deemed submitted. See Civil L.R. 
7-1(b)."
290,2," Originally, Defendants also moved to dismiss claims 1, 2, and 5-9 against Digilock as duplicative of counterclaims in a related 
case pending before the Court. Mot. at 20-23. However, after Plaintiff voluntarily dismissed these counterclaims, Defendants 
withdrew that portion of their motion. "
292,3," Therasense ratcheted up the requirements for proving inequitable conduct on the merits, but did not change the pleading 
standard articulated in Exergen. See Delano Farms Co. v. Cal. Table Grape Comm'n, 655 F.3d 1337, 1350 (Fed. Cir. 2011) 
(adopting the Exergen standard for determining the sufficiency of pleadings in a post-Therasense case); Nalco Co. v. Turner 
Designs, Inc., No. 13-CV-02727 NC, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21362, 2014 WL 645365, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 19, 2014) (""Although 
Therasense raised the bar for proving inequitable conduct on the merits, it did not change the standard for pleading inequitable 
conduct.""). "
295,4," The Court does not consider additional indicators of a submarket that were asserted in Plaintiff's opposition but not alleged in 
the operative complaint. See Opp. at 9; Swartz, 476 F.3d at 763 (stating that generally courts may not look to materials outside 
of the complaint to rule on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, while noting certain exceptions that are irrelevant here). "
296,5," In addition, the Court DENIES as moot Plaintiff's request for judicial notice, Dkt. No. 35, because the Court did not rely on the 
documents in question to reach its disposition. "
326,1," The named plaintiffs are John Nypl; Lisa McCarthy; Mad Travel, Inc., a.k.a. Travel Leaders; Valarie Jolly; Go Everywhere, Inc.; 
and William Rubinsohn, d.b.a. Rubinsohn Travel."
326,2," Defendants are JPMorgan Chase & Co.; JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.; J.P. Morgan Bank, N.A.; Bank of America Corporation; 
Bank of America, N.A.; HSBC Finance Corporation; HSBC Bank USA, N.A.; HSBC North America Holdings Inc.; HSBC Holdings 
plc; Citicorp; Citigroup, Inc.; Citibank, N.A.; UBS AG; Barclays PLC; Barclays Capital, Inc.; Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc; 
and Royal Bank of Scotland, plc. "
327,3," Mr. Saba excluded from his analysis the data from Citibank and Bank of America because there was data from only two 
transactions at each of those banks."
327,4, Plaintiffs were allotted only six weeks after the dismissal of the prior complaint to file a proposed PTAC. 
328,5," Although they focus on futility, Defendants also argue in passing that Plaintiffs' motion should be denied because of undue 
delay. Although undue delay is a potential ground for denying leave to amend, ""[m]ere delay, . . . absent a showing of bad faith 
or undue prejudice, does not provide a basis for the district court to deny the right to amend."" Ruotolo v. City of New York, 514 
F.3d 184, 191 (2d Cir. 2008). Because Plaintiffs' additional factual allegations are in response to the Court's recent decision 
dismissing the Second Amended Complaint and discovery has not begun in this case and only recently commenced in earnest 
in In re Foreign Exchange Benchmark Rates Antitrust Litigation, No. 13 Civ. 7789 (S.D.N.Y.), Defendants have not shown bad 
faith or undue prejudice. "
332,6," Defendants briefly argue that Plaintiffs' UCL claim is futile because the PTAC fails to plead fraudulent practices with specificity 
as required by Rule 9(b), Fed. R. Civ. P. For support, Defendants cite In re Actimmune Mktg. Litig., 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
103408, 2009 WL 3740648, at *6 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 6, 2009). However, the decision in In re Actimmune notes that ""a business act 
or practice need only meet one of the three criteria -- unlawful, unfair, or fraudulent -- to be considered unfair competition under 
the UCL,"" and ""[t]o the extent a plaintiff alleges that a defendant engaged in unfair business practices or acts that are not 
fraudulent, those allegations need not satisfy Rule 9(b)."" 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 103408, [WL] at *7, *14. "
343,1," Nicholl's motion was a motion to vacate and for leave to amend. Because Nicholl only argues that denial of his request for 
leave to amend was error, the denial of the motion to vacate is not addressed. See Access Now, Inc. v. Sw. Airlines Co., 385 
F.3d 1324, 1330 (11th Cir. 2004) HN15[
] (""[A] legal claim or argument that has not been briefed before the court is deemed

354,3," The Court recites some of the background information from its prior decision in this case, Loestrin 24 (D.R.I.), 45 F. Supp. 3d 
180, for general context. Because the Operative Complaints have been amended to include additional claims for relief that 
attack Defendants' conduct every step of the way, from Warner Chilcott's procurement of the patent to the introduction of a new 
drug, Minastrin 24, before the '394 patent expired, the factual allegations underlying the additional claims are included."

355,8," Along with Warner Chilcott Company, LLC, the Court refers to the following defendants as ""Warner Chilcott"": Warner Chilcott 
plc; Warner Chilcott Company, Inc.; Warner Chilcott (US), LLC; Warner Chilcott Laboratories Ireland Limited; Warner Chilcott 
Holdings Company III, Ltd; Warner Chilcott Corporation; and Warner Chilcott Sales (US), LLC. (DPP Compl. ¶¶ 18-22; CVS 
Compl. ¶¶ 19-27.)"
355,9," In January 2013, Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc. acquired Actavis Inc. and assumed the name Actavis, Inc. for its merged 
operation. (DPP Compl. ¶ 26.) In October 2013, Actavis, Inc. acquired Warner Chilcott plc and continued to operate under the 
name Actavis plc. (Id. ¶ 27.) In March 2015, Actavis plc acquired Allergan plc, and announced, in June 2015, that it would 
change its name to Allergan plc. (Id. ¶ 28.) As noted in the text, the Court refers to Warner Chilcott and Watson as the ""Warner 
Chilcott Defendants"" when discussing the arguments presented in their briefing because they submitted joint briefing and to 
provide a degree of continuity with prior decisions of this Court and the Court of Appeals in this MDL. "
356,10," Importantly, a brand manufacturer is not prohibited from offering its own generic during this 180-day period. (DPP Compl. ¶ 
65.) When a brand manufacturer does so, its generic is referred to as an ""authorized generic"" or ""AG."" A brand manufacturer's 
decision not to offer an authorized generic has the potential to increase profits for the initial generic manufacturer. See In re "
357,," Effexor XR Antitrust Litig., No. CIV.A. 11-5479 PGS, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 142206, 2014 WL 4988410, at *21 (D.N.J. Oct. 6, 
2014)."
357,11," Loestrin 1.5/30 denotes that it contains 1.5 mg norethindrone acetate and 30 mcg ethinyl estradiol, whereas Loestrin 1/20 
contains 1 mg norethindrone acetate and 20 mcg ethinyl estradiol. (DPP Compl. 30 n.27.)"
357,12," Plaintiffs define the applicants for the invention covering Loestrin 24 differently. The EPPs define the applicants as ""including 
Hodgen, counsel, and others substantially involved in [the '394 patent's] prosecution""; the DPPs allege that Dr. Hodgen and his 
attorney were responsible for the fraudulent omissions and misrepresentations during the patent prosecution. (EPP Comp. ¶ 
144; DPP Compl. ¶ 3.) The Walgreen and CVS Plaintiffs identify the applicants as Dr. Hodgen and Parke-Davis. (Walgreen 
Comp. ¶ 80; CVS Compl. ¶ 77.) "
358,13," Pfizer acquired Warner Lambert in 2000. Galen Holdings plc acquired the '394 patent from Pfizer, along with the entire 
Loestrin franchise, in March 2003. In July 2004, Galen Holdings changed its name to Warner Chilcott. (DPP Compl. ¶ 146.) "
359,14," Plaintiffs attribute Watson's expeditious filing to the fact that the '394 patent claimed only a ""narrow method"" (viz., three extra 
days of tablets) of administering active ingredients that have been available as oral contraceptives for decades. (DPP Compl. ¶ 
170.)"
359,15," See Warner Chilcott Co. v. Watson Pharms., Inc., C.A. No. 2:06-cv-3491-HAA-ES (D.N.J.). Watson alleged that the applicants 
intentionally concealed from the PTO a public use of the claimed invention; the applicants intentionally misrepresented and 
withheld material information from the PTO about the amount of estrogen in the prior art; and the applicants intentionally 
withheld a prior art teaching that oral contraceptives could be taken for longer than 21 days for purported enhanced efficacy. 
(DPP Compl. ¶ 177.)"
359,16," A pledge by a brand manufacturer not to launch an authorized generic is often referred to as a ""no authorized generic 
agreement"" or ""no-AG agreement."" (DPP Compl. 3 n.1.)"
359,17," The DPPs include a detailed explanation of how they calculated the value of the no-AG agreement to Watson in their 
Complaint. (Id. ¶¶ 194-99.) The Walgreen Plaintiffs, to give another example, ""conservatively"" value this piece of the deal at 
$41.2 million. (Walgreen Compl. ¶ 127.)"
359,18," The EPPs refer to this provision as an acceleration clause and are the only Plaintiffs to challenge it as a reverse payment. 
(EPP Compl. ¶¶ 188-89 & n.11.)"
359,19," In the Femring deal, Watson received the exclusive right, along with Warner Chilcott's subsidiary Galen (Chemicals) Limited to 
promote Femring in the United States from January 9, 2009 through December 31, 2011. Warner Chilcott agreed to pay Watson 
50% of the net sales of Femring to the extent net sales exceeded $10 million and 5% of the net sales above $10 million for 12 
months after the co-promotion agreement ended. In addition, Warner Chilcott was to compensate Watson $5.5 million as a sales 
and marketing support fee, paid in quarterly installments. (DPP Compl. ¶¶ 214-16 & n.43.) "
360,20," See Warner Chilcott LLC v. Lupin Ltd., C.A. No. 1:09-cv-673-JCJ (D. Del.)."
360,21," The EPPs allege that Warner Chilcott paid Lupin $4 million. (EPP Compl. ¶ 5(c).) Defendants clarify that the Lupin Agreement 
provided for $4 million in attorneys' fees and litigation costs, $2 million for each of the Loestrin 24 and Femcon patent lawsuits. 
(Warner Chilcott & Watson Defs.' Omnibus Mem. Supporting Dismissal of all Claims in all Pls.' Compls. (""Warner Chilcott Mot. to 
Dismiss"") 52 n.39, ECF No. 198 (quoting Lupin Agreement, Ex. H to the Decl. of Alison Hanstead ¶ 22).) For the purposes of this 
Opinion, it makes no difference whether Warner Chilcott and Lupin believed Warner Chilcott to be paying $2 million or $4 million 
toward litigation costs and attorneys' fees. "
363,22," The leading antitrust treatise, Areeda and Hovenkamp on Antitrust Law, notes that ""[c]ourts often define market power as the 
ability (1) to control prices or (2) to 'exclude competition.'"" IIB Areeda & Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law, ¶ 501, at 111 (3d ed. 2007) 
(""Areeda""); see, e.g., United States v. E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 351 U.S. 377, 391, 76 S. Ct. 994, 100 L. Ed. 1264 (1956) 
(defining market power as ""the power to control prices or exclude competition""). This definition, however, has been called 
""needlessly confusing"" because the power to exclude competition does not ""itself bring[] substantial market power."" Aggrenox II, 
199 F. Supp. 3d at 665 (quoting Areeda ¶ 501). For example, in Aggrenox II, the court noted that a patent holder may be able to 
exclude competitors from a market for which there is low or no demand. Id. at 664-65 (citing Areeda ¶ 501). In that "
364,," circumstance, however, the patent holder has not established market power because it would be unable to charge 
supracompetitive prices. See id. (citing Areeda ¶ 501). "
365,23," In a thoughtful decision in In re Aggrenox Antitrust Litigation, Judge Underhill concluded that the relevant market in that post-
Actavis case was ""determined by the nature of the challenged [reverse payment settlement] agreement, that the only relevant 
market . . . [was] therefore the market of Aggrenox and its generic equivalents, and that no discovery or evidence relating to 
other drugs as potential substitutes [was] relevant."" Aggrenox II, 199 F. Supp. 3d at 663; see also id. at 665-66 (noting that the 
relevant market would ""be implicitly defined by the scope of the disputed patent[,]"" which was the market in which the allegedly 
unlawful reverse payment ""acted as an anticompetitive restraint""). While the Court notes this interesting approach, it takes no 
position at this time on whether, in this case, it will exclude indirect evidence at summary judgment or trial, when the question of 
defining the relevant market will be ripe for decision. Notably, in Judge Underhill's earlier decision on the Aggrenox defendants' 
motion to dismiss, he made clear that market power is ""clearly a fact-intensive inquiry, and for that reason 'courts hesitate to 
grant motions to dismiss for failure to plead a relevant product market.'"" Aggrenox I, 94 F. Supp. 3d at 246 (quoting Todd v. 
Exxon Corp., 275 F.3d 191, 199-200 (2d Cir. 2001)). "
366,24," See, e.g., Mot. Hr'g Tr. 33:16-22, Jan. 13, 2017, ECF No. 266 (Warner Chilcott's attorney advancing a framework under which 
the Court ""look[s] at each alleged payment [to] see what are the allegations, are they plausible as to whether this is first of all 
cognizable at all; but, if it is, to what extent have they plausibly alleged the payment exceeds fair value. And then you basically 
look at them in total and say, well, together do they plausibly amount to something that's large""); Mem. in Supp. of DPPs' Obj. to 
Warner Chilcott & Watson Defs.' Mot. to Dismiss All Claims in All Pls.' May 9, 2016 Compls. 53, ECF No. 206-2 (""Even if this 
Court should find that one of the provisions does not constitute a reserve-payment, such a finding would still not warrant 
dismissal . . . .""). "
367,25," This is consistent with the framework posed in Aaron Edlin et al., Activating Actavis, 28 Antitrust 16, 18 (Fall 2013): The payment prong involves the following steps: (a) valuing any consideration [**52]  flowing from the patentee to the 
claimed infringer, which may be made over time and may take forms other than cash; (b) deducting from that payment the 
patent holder's avoided litigation costs; and (c) deducting from that payment the value of goods, services, or other 
consideration provided by the claimed infringer to the patent holder as part of the same transaction (or linked transactions). "
368,26," At the hearing on these motions, the Warner Chilcott Defendants suggested that ""it needs to be looked at really from both 
sides. But . . . in many ways the most important perspective is from the perspective of the patent holder."" (Mot. Hr'g Tr. 36:24-
37:2, Jan. 13, 2017, ECF No. 266.) "
369,27, The Femcon deal is addressed below with the other components of the Lupin Agreement. 
372,28," Addressing a component of the Watson Agreement, Warner Chilcott argues, as it must, that ""agreements are judged at the 
time of the settlement."" (Warner Chilcott Mot. to Dismiss 71.) Lupin's argument at the hearing on these motions that ""both the 
potential value at the time of the agreement and the actual value eventually reached is zero"" is unconvincing, and of course, 
does not reflect the allegations set forth in the Operative Complaints. (Mot. Hr'g Tr. 53:12-14, Jan. 13, 2017, ECF No. 266.) 
Exactly how much the deal should be discounted to account for this contingency is a fact-intensive inquiry that will be sorted out 
with discovery. It is enough, at this stage, for the EPPs and Retailers to have alleged facts plausibly supporting the expected 
value to Lupin at the time of the agreement. See Loestrin 24, 814 F.3d at 552. "
373,29," Fraud on the PTO arises in two arenas: when plaintiffs assert it in suits alleging antitrust liability, like the instant case, and 
when defendants assert inequitable conduct as an equitable defense in patent infringement actions. See Nobelpharma AB, 141 
F.3d at 1070; see also Exergen Corp. v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 575 F.3d 1312, 1330 (Fed. Cir. 2009). Both Defendants and 
Plaintiffs cite cases that discuss inequitable conduct in parsing out the elements of Walker Process fraud on the PTO, but they 
do not always agree on their significance. Prior to 2011, the Federal Circuit explained that inequitable conduct serves as a ""shield,"" whereas ""Walker Process fraud is a 
more serious finding of fraud [that] potentially exposes a patentee to antitrust liability and thus serves as a sword."" Nobelpharma 
AB, 141 F.3d at 1070. Thus, the Federal Circuit asserted that Walker Process fraud is ""a more serious offense than inequitable 
conduct."" Id. In 2011, in Therasense, the Federal Circuit addressed ""problems created by the expansion and overuse of the 
inequitable conduct doctrine . . . ."" Therasense, Inc. v. Becton, Dickinson & Co., 649 F.3d 1276, 1285 (Fed. Cir. 2011). The court "
374,," noted that, over time, courts had started applying lower standards for intent and materiality in inequitable conduct cases, which 
had ""inadvertently led to many unintended consequences."" Id. at 1290. The court tightened the standards for those elements 
and clarified that ""[i]ntent and materiality are separate requirements""; intent may not be inferred from materiality alone; and but-
for materiality must be demonstrated to prove inequitable conduct. Id. at 1290-91. The Federal Circuit has since remarked that 
""[a]fter Therasense, the showing required for proving inequitable conduct and the showing required for proving the fraud 
component of Walker Process liability may be nearly identical."" TransWeb, LLC v. 3M Innovative Properties Co., 812 F.3d 1295, 
1307 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (citation omitted). It is plain, therefore, that after Therasense, inequitable conduct mandates something 
that approaches, or is identical to, the more exacting requirements of Walker Process fraud. Thus, post-Therasense cases 
analyzing inequitable conduct may be instructive on Walker Process fraud, but the Court remains cautious that courts may have 
endorsed lower thresholds for intent and materiality in pre-Therasense inequitable conduct cases."
374,30," The instant case is readily distinguishable from Exergen, in which the pleadings were deemed insufficient for alleging that 
""Exergen, its agents and/or attorneys"" were responsible for the alleged fraduluent acts. Exergen Corp., 575 F.3d at 1329. Here, 
Dr. Hodgen is plainly a ""specific individual."" "
378,31," The Warner Chilcott Defendants ask the Court to consider the '394 patent's full prosecution history, as well as the full text of 
the prior art reference quoted in the Operative Complaints. (Warner Chilcott Mot. to Dismiss 102-04.) For the reasons stated 
above with respect to the 1993 human study, the Court declines to consider the materials proffered by the Warner Chilcott 
Defendants, and except as noted, takes the allegations in the well-pleaded Operative Complaints as true. "
380,32," In its Complaint, the Walgreen Plaintiffs allege that Dr. Hodgen was also aware that Schering AG was investigating an oral 
contraceptive regimen using 23 to 25 hormone-containing tablets per 28-day cycle, and that it constituted invalidating prior art. 
(See Walgreen Compl. ¶ 79.) Defendants argue that it did not constitute invalidating prior art or public use because it was 
outside the country, and Retailer Plaintiffs appear to allege these facts only as additional support for their sham litigation claim. 
(See Warner Chilcott Mot. to Dismiss 96 n.73; Retailers' Mem. in Opp'n to Warner Chilcott/Watson Mot. to Dismiss 53, ECF No. 
207.) Because the Court allows Retailer Plaintiffs' sham litigation claim to proceed on other grounds, it need not reach the merits 
of the Warner Chilcott Defendants' arguments on this score. "
382,33," As the reader will recall from above, the rule-of-reason test proceeds in three steps: ""once a plaintiff establishes that a 
monopolist's conduct is anticompetitive or exclusionary, the monopolist may proffer 'nonpretextual' procompetitive justifications 
for its conduct."" Thereafter, ""[t]he plaintiff may then either rebut those justifications or demonstrate that the anticompetitive harm 
outweighs the procompetitive benefit."" Namenda, 787 F.3d at 652; see also Nexium II, 42 F. Supp. 3d at 262-63. "
383,34," On this second ground, the Third Circuit indicated that Doryx capsules had been available for more than twenty years and 
generic companies had been free to ""engineer their own versions during that time;"" had generated substantial profits from the 
sale of generics; and had not been harmed by the defendant's product changes. Mylan Pharm. Inc. v. Warner Chilcott Pub. Ltd. 
Co., 838 F.3d 421, 438-39 (3d Cir. 2016). "
385,35," The states are: Alabama, Florida, Illinois, Minnesota, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Tennessee."
385,36," They are: Alabama, California, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Florida, Illinois, Kansas, Maryland, 
Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, 
Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia. "
386,37," On the issue of federal preemption, the First Circuit Court of Appeals, this Court's regional circuit, controls the outcome here. 
However, because the First Circuit apparently has not yet had occasion to address the instant issue, the Federal Circuit's 
precedent, along with precedent from other courts, is instructive. See Hunter Douglas, Inc. v. Harmonic Design, Inc., 153 F.3d 
1318, 1333 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (citing Cable Elec. Prods. Inc. v. Genmark, Inc., 770 F.2d 1015, 1032-33 (Fed. Cir. 1985)). "
387,38," Defendants identify the following twenty-five states (and Puerto Rico) in which the EPPs do not reside and have not purchased 
Loestrin products: Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Montana, 
Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Puerto Rico, Utah, Vermont, Washington, West 
Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. The EPPs have not pleaded any claims under Indiana law. (Warner Chilcott Mot. to Dismiss 
137, 142 & n.96.) "
393,1," The Opposition was untimely. Pursuant to the Standing Orders, the Opposition should have been filed 14 days after the filing of 
the Motion. Dkt. 7 at 9. It was filed more than 30 days late. However, because no prejudice resulted from this late filing, the 
Opposition is considered."
393,2," Moving Defendants filed a Request for Judicial Notice as part of the Motion to Dismiss. Dkt. 12-1. The Request sought judicial 
notice of the following documents: • Ex. 1: A Deed of Trust recorded on October 10, 2006 as Instrument Number 062243568 in the Official Records of the Los

395,," • Ex. 29: A Notice of Default recorded on February 8, 2016 as Instrument Number 20160139901 in the Official Records of 
the Los Angeles County Recorder's Office. Exhibits 1-13, 18, 20 and 23-29 are subject to judicial notice because they are true and correct copies of official records of the 
Los Angeles County Recorder's Office. See Settle v. World Sav. Bank, FSB, No. ED CV 11-00800 MMM, 2012 WL 1026103, at 
*3 (C.D. Cal. Jan. 11, 2012) (listing cases granting judicial notice of notices recorded in a municipal recorder's office). Exhibits 
14-17, 19 and 21-22 are subject to judicial notice because they reflect the records of other federal courts. Morris v. SPSSM 
Investments 8, LP, No. CV1401305MMMMANX, 2014 WL 12573523, at *3 (C.D. Cal. June 4, 2014) (""Courts may take judicial 
notice of such documents, as they are 'capable of immediate and accurate determination by resort to' a source -- the courts' 
dockets -- which are 'of reasonably indisputable accuracy.'""). Plaintiff argues that ""while the incident of these recorded ASSIGNMENTS and NOTICES is judicially noticeable the contents of 
the recordings are not."" Dkt. 21 at 20. However, the contents of the documents are subject to judicial notice, but the truth of the 
representations made in those documents is not. For example, it is appropriate to take judicial notice that the Substitution of 
Trustee recorded on February 8, 2016 stated that Zieve was substituted as the trustee. Ex. 28 to Request for Judicial Notice,

396,3," Plaintiff states that he also filed for bankruptcy on July 2, 2009. Dkt. 27 at 3. However, no evidence of this filing has been 
presented, and the Bankruptcy Court case number that Plaintiff has provided (2:09-bk-2897-SB) does not lead to any results on

399,4," In connection with this briefing, Plaintiff has requested judicial notice of the following: • Ex. 1: DB Structured Products Inc. vs. John St Dennis et. al., Los Angeles County Superior Court case number

Dennis et. al., Los Angeles County Superior Court, case number NC060035 against Plaintiff without prejudice on 
September 2, 2015. "
400,," Exhibits 1 and 2 are subject to judicial notice because they reflect the records of other federal courts. Morris, 2014 WL 
12573523, at *3. The fact that the action filed at case number NC060035 has been dismissed is subject to judicial notice insofar 
as it reflects the docket in that case. Judicial notice of ACE Secs. Corp. Home Equity Loan Tr. v. DB Structured Prods is 
unnecessary because the consideration of court opinions does not require such notice. "
402,5," Yvanova did not address whether or when a plaintiff may have standing to pursue a pre-foreclosure challenge to an 
assignment. Indeed, as noted above, it was expressly limited to considering the post-foreclosure context. Yvanova, 62 Cal. 4th 
at 924. Accordingly, and contrary to the arguments by Defendants' counsel at the hearing, it does not restrict Gomes or any of 
the subsequent authority that discussed and applied Gomes. "

Appellants prior to the appeal."
413,3," Ordinarily, when a plaintiff sues a defendant, one expects that, if there is a settlement, it will involve a payment from the 
defendant to the plaintiff. A so-called ""reverse payment"" settlement takes place when the plaintiff settles the case by paying the 
defendant. See FTC v. Actavis, Inc., 570 U.S. 136, 133 S. Ct. 2223, 2227, 186 L. Ed. 2d 343 (2013) (""Because the settlement 
requires the patentee to pay the alleged infringer, rather than the other way around, this kind of settlement agreement is often 
called a 'reverse payment' settlement agreement."")."
413,4," The District Court had certified both the direct-purchaser and indirect-purchaser classes in August 2011. The indirect 
purchasers allege antitrust claims under the laws of Arizona, California, the District of Columbia, Florida, Hawaii, Iowa, Kansas,

indirect-purchaser Appellants only have standing to bring their claims under the laws of states where their members reside — 
that is, California, Florida, Illinois, Nevada, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, and Wisconsin."
413,5," Aetna, an insurance provider, had purchased brand and generic versions of Wellbutrin XL in all 50 states. It sought to intervene 
in order to save the indirect purchasers' claims from dismissal. "
414,6," The ""infringement"" in those circumstances is a legal construct that permits a patent holder to initiate suit without having to wait 
for the generic manufacturer to actually make, use, or sell a generic version of the patented drug. Eli Lilly & Co. v. Medtronic, 
Inc., 496 U.S. 661, 678, 110 S. Ct. 2683, 110 L. Ed. 2d 605 (1990) (explaining that ""the defined act of infringement [is] artificial"" 
and exists to ""enable the judicial adjudication upon which the ANDA ... scheme[] depend[s]""). Because a paragraph IV 
certification is defined as a technical act of infringement, it allows a patent owner to sue, but it does not speak to whether the 
disclosed generic drug does, in fact, infringe the cited patent. Glaxo, Inc. v. Novopharm, Ltd., 110 F.3d 1562, 1569 (Fed. Cir. 
1997) (""The occurrence of the defined 'act of infringement' does not determine the ultimate question whether what will be sold 
will infringe any relevant patent.""). "
415,7," While the exclusivity period can be forfeited if the first-filer fails to market its drug, it can take time to trigger the forfeiture. 
""Forfeiture applies only upon the satisfaction of two statutory conditions. The first condition [(i.e., the failure to market the drug 
either within 75 days of the date the ANDA was approved or within 30 months of the date the ANDA was submitted, whichever 
comes earlier)] is relatively easy to satisfy. The second is triggered only if an appeals court rules that the relevant patents are 
invalid or not infringed, or if a settlement reaches a similar result."" C. Scott Hemphill, An Aggregate Approach to Antitrust: Using 
New Data and Rulemaking to Preserve Drug Competition, 109 Colum. L. Rev. 629, 660-61 (2009) (footnotes omitted). That rule

of proof (i.e., clear and convincing evidence, or preponderance of the evidence) needed to show objective baselessness. 
Because our decision in this case does not hinge on the standard of proof, we leave that question for another day. "

419,20," Hydrochloric acid is a stabilizing agent. (See Anchen's paragraph IV certification, JA 35714 (referring to hydrochloric acid as a 
stabilizing agent).) "
420,21," As explained above, Anchen's ANDA quantified the amount of hydrochloric acid in its drug as ""--"" and indicated that the other 
ingredients summed to 100%. The Appellants argue that, under standard industry convention, ""--"" denotes a residual quantity 
greater than zero. However, they do not point to any evidence showing that GSK and Biovail's interpretation of either ""--"" or 
""100%"" was unreasonable. More to the point, they have not demonstrated that it was unreasonable to view the claim language 
""free of stabilizer"" as covering a residual amount so small as to not register in the tables they provided."
420,22," It is worth noting that GSK withdrew from the case well before claim construction began. While it is no doubt important to think 
about possible constructions for patent claims before filing a case, it would be unfair to require parties to divine the outcome of 
claim construction before filing. That is especially true in the Hatch-Waxman context, where many details about the potentially 
infringing drug (details that could shape a plaintiff's claim construction position) cannot be known at the time a suit is filed and 
where there are congressionally designed pressures to file suit quickly. See 21 U.S.C. § 355(b)(3)(D) (stating that an ANDA 
applicant is required to provide notice to patentees ""includ[ing] a detailed statement of the factual and legal basis of the opinion 
of the applicant that the patent[s] [are] invalid or will not be infringed,"" but refraining from requiring ANDA applicants to submit 
any additional information). The time limits imposed by the Hatch-Waxman Act embody a ""file-now, discover-details-later"" policy, 
and while the merit of that policy may make for an interesting debate, Aaron S. Kesselheim & Jonathan J. Darrow, Hatch-
Waxman Turns 30: Do We Need a Redesigned Approach for the Modern Era?, 15 Yale J. Health Pol'y, L. & Ethics 293 (2015) 
(describing the debate over whether the Act is good policy), it is not our place — nor was it GSK's — to take that debate on. We 
decline to apply the antitrust laws in a way that would undermine the operation of Hatch-Waxman. It is likewise a painful stretch to say that Biovail's claim construction arguments show GSK was wrong to join in the initial 
decision to file against Anchen. At the time the suit was filed, GSK was not obligated to know the details of claim construction 
arguments that Biovail would later present."
420,23," That the Court elected at times to use the verb ""find"" instead of ""conclude"" does not change our decision. "
421,24," GSK and Biovail filed their suit against Anchen on December 21, 2004. GSK withdrew from the case exactly four months later, 
on April 21, 2005, long before the 30-month stay expired. In order to prevail against GSK, the Appellants must show that at least 
some delay can be attributed to GSK's actions in the case — that is, they must show that at least some delay can be attributed 
to the first four months of the litigation. There is no evidence in the record indicating that any delay can be linked to that period of 
time. In a heading in their statement of undisputed facts, the Appellants state that ""GSK Withdrew From the Anchen and Abrika 
Cases But Not the Conspiracy[.]"" It takes some chutzpah to use that language, as GSK plainly disputes that it was ever in a 
conspiracy with Biovail. We consider the conspiracy argument in more detail below."
421,25," Without parsing the Abrika ANDA in the same detail as we did Anchen's, it suffices to say that the Appellants have not 
provided evidence to demonstrate that it was objectively unreasonable for Biovail and GSK to act on the technical act of 
infringement that the ANDA and paragraph IV certification provided. "
422,26," GSK and Biovail did not produce the common interest agreement. Instead, the parties stipulated that ""[u]pon receiving 
[Anchen's] Paragraph [IV] certification ... GSK and Biovail reached a common interest agreement with respect to their common 
legal interest in potential infringement of [the '341 and '327 patents] by Anchen or the filers of any additional ANDAs and related 
Paragraph [IV] notices ... ."" (JA 11513.) GSK and Biovail further stipulated that the common interest agreement ""related to the 
Paragraph [IV] certifications of [Anchen, Abrika, and Impax]"" as well as the Anchen and Abrika actions. (Id.)"
422,27, The Appellants do not have any evidence regarding communication between Biovail and GSK with respect to the Watson suit.
422,28," As already discussed, for a generic manufacturer to obtain FDA approval of an ANDA, the manufacturer must demonstrate 
that its drug is bioequivalent to a drug that went through the rigorous NDA approval process. Actavis, 133 S. Ct. at 2228. "
423,," ""Bioequivalence is the absence of a significant difference in the rate and extent to which the active ingredient or active moiety in 
pharmaceutical equivalents or pharmaceutical alternatives becomes available at the site of drug action when administered at the 
same molar dose under similar conditions in an appropriately designed study."" 21 C.F.R. § 314.3 (2016)."
423,29," Eight days before Biovail filed its Petition, GSK employees sent an internal email expressing uncertainty as to whether Biovail 
had filed a petition."
423,30," GSK sent a fax to Biovail indicating that it ""[did] not wish to participate in or be associated with ... Biovail explorations, 
deliberations, strategizing, decision-making, or ultimate advocacy with the FDA."" (JA 12356.) Biovail responded and confirmed 
that it ""[did] not seek the participation of GSK[.]"" (JA 12358.)"
423,31," In e-mail correspondence, GSK employees acknowledged that ""Biovail is curious if we have any information on metabolites 
that might form the basis of a challenge to the standard bioequivalence testing/standards."" (JA 13281.) In response, Stan Hull, a 
GSK employee, explained that ""[the] information is available internally, but has not been shared with Biovail, and it is our 
recommendation not to share metabolite data with Biovail."" (JA 13282.) "
424,32," Indeed, in a heading in their statement of undisputed facts, the Appellants state that ""GSK concluded that the bioequivalence 
... argument was wrong."""
424,33," As was the case with each of the four sham lawsuit claims, there is another causation problem. As we will explain in more 
detail below, Anchen's launch would have been delayed by a blocking patent owned by Andrx. That means that any delay 
caused by Biovail's FDA Petition is irrelevant — the blocking patent would have prevented a lawful launch even in the absence 
of Biovail's Petition."
424,34," In evaluating Biovail's Petition, the District Court considered the Petition as a series of four requests. The Court concluded that 
two of the four requests were successful, and thus not baseless, and that two of the four requests were potentially baseless. The 
Court then concluded that GSK was entitled to summary judgment because the Appellants had failed to show that their injury 
was attributable to the unsuccessful (and potentially sham) requests, rather than to the successful requests. We have doubts about that reasoning. The flaw is in viewing the Petition as four independent requests, rather than as a single 
petition. When considering whether a petition is entitled to immunity, courts should consider whether the petition as a whole is 
objectively baseless. See Tyco Healthcare Grp. LP v. Mut. Pharm. Co., 762 F.3d 1338, 1347 (Fed. Cir. 2014); Cheminor Drugs, 
Ltd. v. Ethyl Corp., 168 F.3d 119, 123 (3d Cir. 1999) (""[W]e will determine whether Ethyl's petition was objectively baseless ... ."" 
(emphasis added)). While the District Court considered the merit of each of the Petition's constituent requests, it did not reach 
any conclusions regarding whether the Petition, in toto, was objectively baseless. As a result, the Court's consideration of 
causation and delay was premature."
424,35," GSK argues that the Appellants did not properly preserve the serial petitioning claim below, despite the fact that the Supreme 
Court precedent on which Hanover 3201 Realty, LLC v. Village Supermarkets, Inc., 806 F.3d 162 (3d Cir. 2015), relied was "
425,," decided ""more than 40 years ago,"" and that the Appellants' trial counsel was familiar with it from a prior case. (Ans. Br. 64.) The 
Appellants respond that asserting a general theory of sham litigation was sufficient because in doing so, they ""recounted a series 
of meritless petitions filed to frustrate competition and prolong the defendants' monopoly."" (Consolidated Reply Brief of Direct 
Purchaser and End-Payor Class Plaintiffs-Appellants 74.) In Hanover, we rejected an argument that the plaintiffs had waived a 
serial litigation claim where the plaintiffs ""consistently"" argued ""that the sham exception applie[d]"" and ""alleg[ed] an 'illegal 
scheme' through a 'series of sham litigations,' [that] put Defendants on notice of the relevant facts[.]"" 806 F.3d at 179 n.13. 
Although the Appellants did not independently articulate the ""series"" claim in the District Court, we conclude that, as in Hanover, 
the recitation of sequential litigious activity was sufficient to preserve the claim. "
426,36," This is Teva's first appearance in this case. It is another producer and distributor of generic drugs. As explained above, because Biovail filed its suit against Anchen promptly, it was able to delay the approval of Anchen's ANDA 
for 30 months. However, Biovail did not file against Impax within 45 days of receiving Impax's paragraph IV certification. As a 
result, the only barrier to the approval of Impax's ANDA was Anchen's first-filer exclusivity period."
426,37," An ""authorized generic"" is a non-branded version of a brand-name drug that is produced by the brand-name company itself."
426,38," The appeals process was at an early stage — Biovail filed its notice of appeal on September 13, 2006, and its opening brief on 
December 14, 2006."
426,39," In November 2006, Andrx was acquired by Watson. For simplicity, we will continue to refer to Andrx by that name."
426,40," To ensure that the license would, in fact, be exclusive, Biovail amended its development agreement with GSK. To facilitate the 
settlement, GSK agreed to refrain from launching an authorized generic version of 150 mg Wellbutrin XL for the duration of 
Teva's exclusive license."
426,41," The agreement contained five other ""trigger"" provisions that would allow Teva to market generic versions of Wellbutrin. None 
of the other provisions is relevant here."
426,42," Biovail and GSK similarly amended their development agreement to preclude GSK from launching an authorized generic 
version of 300 mg Wellbutrin XL."
426,43," The license was written to retroactively authorize the sales that Teva had made prior to entering the license agreement. The 
Appellants contend that the license was meaningless and that ""Teva did not need a license to make and sell the product 
because Teva was already doing so."" (JA 2635.)"
426,44," The agreement specified that the tablets must be ""Generic NDA Equivalent."" (JA 34081.) "
427,45," The agreement explains that Biovail was an assignee of the license agreement between Andrx and GSK, and thus that Biovail 
had the ability to grant a sublicense to Andrx's patent."
427,46," By statute, the parties were required to submit their several settlement agreements to the FTC within 10 days. Medicare 
Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, Pub. L. No. 108-173, § 1112(a), 117 Stat 2066, 2461-62 
(2003). The omnibus agreement required the parties to submit the agreements to the FTC within two days and to either revise or 
terminate the agreement in response to any FTC concerns. In addition to the five agreements described above, Andrx sent a 
letter to Anchen explaining that, in light of the license agreement between GSK and Andrx, Andrx would dismiss its infringement 
suit against Anchen. That same day, Biovail and GSK amended their development agreement (the agreement that granted GSK 
an exclusive license to Biovail's patents) to bring it into compliance with the substance of the Teva-Biovail agreement. Finally, 
Biovail agreed to dismiss its suit against Watson. There was no payment (reverse or otherwise) associated with the Biovail-
Watson settlement. "
428,47," The Supreme Court explicitly rejected the claim that reverse payment settlement agreements are ""presumptively unlawful"" and 
concluded that it would also be improper to evaluate reverse payment agreements via a ""quick-look"" approach. Id. at 2237."
428,48," The District Court granted a Daubert motion to exclude that expert's opinion relating to the rule of reason analysis. However, 
the Daubert motion did not appear to challenge the expert's opinions with respect to the value associated with the no-AG 
agreement. And, in Actavis, the Supreme Court recognized the immense value associated with market exclusivity. See Actavis, "
429,133," S. Ct. at 2229 (citing C. Scott Hemphill, Paying for Delay: Pharmaceutical Patent Settlement as a Regulatory Design 
Problem, 81 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 1553, 1579 (2006))."
429,49," We intend no comment on whether a no-AG promise could be justified in the sense of being a sound exercise of business 
judgment and consonant with good public policy."
429,50," It is worth noting that this case differs from Actavis and King in at least one important respect: in both Actavis and King, the 
challenged agreements ended litigation between the brand-name manufacturer and the generic manufacturer. In this case, 
however, the agreements allowed Biovail's appeal to continue. (See JA 3697 (explicitly noting that the agreement did not ""settle 
or otherwise end the Biovail Anchen lawsuit"").) In acknowledging that difference, the District Court concluded that the 
agreements in this case ""do[] not present the same antitrust concerns that motivated the court in Actavis to subject the 
settlement to antitrust scrutiny."" (JA 183.) We question that conclusion. While there is language in Actavis that describes the 
premature termination of litigation as an anticompetitive harm, see 133 S. Ct. at 2236 (explaining that a patentee should not be 
allowed to ""us[e] its monopoly profits to avoid the risk of patent invalidation or a finding of noninfringement""), the Supreme 
Court's holding was not so narrow. Instead, Actavis stands for the broader proposition that both ""patent and antitrust policies are 
... relevant in determining the 'scope of the patent monopoly'—and consequently antitrust law immunity—that is conferred by a 
patent."" Id. at 2231. In other words, the Court took issue with reverse payments not simply because they could lead to the 
premature termination of litigation, but rather because they eliminate the risk of competition. Id. at 2236; King, 791 F.3d at 405. While the agreements at issue here did not end the litigation between Biovail and Anchen, they nevertheless implicate the kinds 
of concerns articulated in Actavis by delaying the entry of 150 mg generic Wellbutrin XL and by delaying the entry of an 
authorized generic version of both 150 and 300 mg Wellbutrin XL. That conclusion follows directly from Actavis and King and is 
also supported by the FTC, which filed an amicus brief in this case. (See FTC Br. 15 (""An agreement that forecloses the 
possibility of at-risk entry into the market (in exchange for shared monopoly profits) can also be anticompetitive under that 
analysis."").) The view of the law espoused by the FTC, adopted by the majority in Actavis, and followed by our Court in King, has 
been subject to cogent criticism, see, e.g., Actavis, 133 S. Ct. at 2240-47 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting), but the controlling 
precedent is what it is."
429,51," It does not appear that the Appellants have presented any arguments relating exclusively to Anchen's generic version of 300 
mg Wellbutrin XL. As a result, any arguments the Appellants might have regarding the 300 mg product could be viewed as 
waived. Nagle v. Alspach, 8 F.3d 141, 143 (3d Cir. 1993). However, for the reasons stated above, the Appellants would not 
prevail on that issue even if it were not waived."
429,52," One could argue that the no-AG agreement relating to the 300 mg product was part of the payment used to persuade Anchen 
to delay its launch of the 150 mg product. If one adopts that view, then the 300 mg no-AG agreement would be subject to the 
same analysis as the 150 mg no-AG agreement and there would not be any claim unique to the generic 300 mg product. "
430,53," Though judge-made, federal antitrust standing is rooted in federal statutory law, and antitrust standing under state law is 
likewise rooted in the respective statutes of the several states represented within the ranks of the indirect purchaser Appellants. 
The state requirements for antitrust standing are functionally identical to the federal requirements in this respect — each of the 
state antitrust laws asserted in this case requires antitrust plaintiffs to prove that they have suffered an antitrust injury. Moreover, 
the standards for proving antitrust injury under the state laws appear to be identical to the standards under federal law. See

Tenn. July 6, 1998). As a result, our standing and causation analysis on this issue applies equally to the direct purchasers' 
claims and the indirect purchasers' claims."
430,54," ""The Supreme Court ... [has] articulated several factors to be considered when deciding whether a complainant has antitrust 
standing."" Ethypharm S.A. France, 707 F.3d at 232 (3d Cir. 2013) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Those factors 
include: (1) the causal connection between the antitrust violation and the harm to the plaintiff and the intent by the defendant to 
cause that harm, with neither factor alone conferring standing; (2) whether the plaintiff's alleged injury is of the type for 
which the antitrust laws were intended to provide redress; (3) the directness of the injury, which addresses the concerns 
that liberal application of standing principles might produce speculative claims; (4) the existence of more direct victims of 
the alleged antitrust violations; and (5) the potential for duplicative recovery or complex apportionment of damages. Id. at 232-33 (internal citations omitted). Because ""[t]he second factor, antitrust injury, is a necessary but insufficient condition of 
antitrust standing[,] ... if it is lacking, we need not address the remaining ... factors."" Id. at 233 (internal quotation marks and 
citation omitted); see also City of Pittsburgh v. W. Penn Power Co., 147 F.3d 256, 265 (""[B]ecause there is no causal connection 
and no antitrust injury, we need not examine the other ... standing factors."")."
430,55," In Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, the Supreme Court held that indirect purchasers do not have standing to bring antitrust suits 
under federal law. 431 U.S. 720, 730-31, 97 S. Ct. 2061, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1977); see also In re Lower Lake Erie Iron Ore 
Antitrust Litig., 998 F.2d 1144, 1163 n.10 (3d Cir. 1993) (""[In Illinois Brick Co.,] [t]he Court held that § 4 [of the Clayton Act] did 
not permit ... indirect purchasers ... to recover for the overcharge passed through the chain of distribution.""). However, indirect 
purchasers do have standing to assert antitrust claims in each of the state causes of action asserted here. Nev. Rev. Stat. § 
598A.210 (Nevada statute granting standing to indirect purchasers to recover for antitrust violations); In re Dynamic Random "
431,," Access Memory (Dram) Antitrust Litig., 516 F. Supp. 2d 1072, 1094-95 (N.D. Cal. 2007) (recognizing that indirect purchaser 
suits are permitted in Arizona, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North 
Carolina, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wisconsin); Indirect Purchaser Lawsuits: A State-by-State Survey 27, 215, 287, 337 
(Eric McCarthy et al., eds., 2010) (explaining that California, New York, Tennessee, and Wisconsin each allow indirect 
purchasers to assert antitrust claims)."
431,56," GSK also argues that Anchen's launch would have been blocked by FDA regulations relating to Anchen's production facilities. 
We do not consider that argument because, even if it were given full weight, it would only show that Anchen would have had to 
wait until June 12, 2007 to launch — a date that was almost a year prior to its actual launch. In other words, the argument 
relates to the length of delay, rather than the existence of a delay. "
432,57," The Appellants point to our recent decision in In re Fosamax (Alendronate Sodium) Products Liability Litigation, 852 F.3d 268 
(3d Cir. 2017), to support their claim that juries are ""'routinely' given questions that permissibly require them to 'predict the 
outcome of a hypothetical scenario' or to 'speculate' or 'guess what could have happened in a counterfactual setting' by 
assessing corporate motives and thought processes or by 'evaluat[ing] inference[s] about human behavior.'"" (March 27, 2017 
28(j) letter at 2 (alterations in original) (quoting Fosamax, 852 F.3d at 289, 297, 299).) Their argument is correct, but irrelevant. 
The fact that juries may predict the outcome of hypothetical scenarios says nothing about the type or amount of evidence that is 
needed for a plaintiff to withstand summary judgment on a claim involving a counterfactual scenario. As explained above, the 
Appellants have not presented sufficient evidence upon which a reasonable jury could rely to conclude that it is more likely than 
not that Anchen and Andrx would have entered into a license agreement in the counterfactual world. While it may be better than 
speculative that Anchen and Andrx would have had an incentive to talk, it is, on this record, pure speculation that they would 
have reached an agreement. "
433,58," In the Actavis decision, there was a debate between the majority and the Chief Justice on whether lower courts would be 
required to resolve substantive patent questions in order to adequately assess the merits of reverse payment antitrust claims. 
Writing for the majority, Justice Breyer asserted that ""it is normally not necessary to litigate patent validity to answer the antitrust 
question ... ."" Actavis, 133 S. Ct. at 2236. The Chief Justice disagreed: [S]ettling a patent claim cannot possibly impose unlawful anticompetitive harm if the patent holder is acting within the scope 
of a valid patent and therefore permitted to do precisely what the antitrust suit claims is unlawful. This means that in any 
such antitrust suit, the defendant (patent holder) will want to use the validity of his patent as a defense—in other words, he'll 
want to say ""I can do this because I have a valid patent that lets [**57]  me do this."" I therefore don't see how the majority 
can conclude that it won't normally be ""necessary to litigate patent validity to answer the antitrust question[.]"" Id. at 2244 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting). The present case appears to vindicate the Chief Justice's analysis. As he predicted, GSK 
argues that the Andrx patent (which was a central component of the agreements) defeats the Appellants' suit, and, as he 
predicted, we cannot resolve this aspect of the case without considering the merits of the underlying patent dispute."
433,59," In the context of patent litigation, a launch is said to be ""at-risk"" if it takes place before the questions of infringement and 
validity are resolved, either through litigation or a license. See In re Modafinil Antitrust Litig., 837 F.3d at 244. "
434,60, Adelman's estimates and analysis are uncontested.
434,61," The probability that Andrx would prevail on all three issues was calculated by multiplying the probability of success on each 
issue. 0.8*0.9*0.5=0.36, which is approximately 1/3."
434,62," ""Assignor estoppel prevents a party who assigns a patent to another from later challenging the validity of the assigned patent. 
This doctrine prevents the unfairness and injustice of permitting a party to sell something and later to assert that what was sold 
is worthless. ... [A]n assignment contains an implicit representation by the assignor that the patent rights that he is assigning ... 
are not worthless."" Mentor Graphics Corp., v. Quickturn Design Sys., Inc., 150 F.3d 1374, 1378 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (internal 
quotation marks and citations omitted); see Shamrock Techs., Inc. v. Med. Sterilization, Inc., 903 F.2d 789, 793 (Fed. Cir. 1990) 
(explaining assignor estoppel also applies to those who are in privity with the assignor). Because the estoppel applies not only to 
the individual inventor but also to those in privity, Anchen itself, and not just its founder and CEO, would likely have been 
estopped."
434,63," The Appellants' only response to that analysis is that GSK never moved for summary judgment on inventor estoppel and that 
Anchen had not raised the issue of assignor estoppel before it settled the case. Even if those assertions are true, they do not 
show that Andrx would not have asserted the estoppel argument as the case progressed."
434,64," Having concluded that the Appellants lack antitrust standing, we do not need to consider the District Court's application of the 
rule of reason. We note, however, that the rule of reason inquiry is fact intensive and is not easy to resolve at the summary 
judgment stage. See [**61]  Poller v. Columbia Broad. Sys., Inc., 368 U.S. 464, 473, 82 S. Ct. 486, 7 L. Ed. 2d 458 (1962) 
(""[S]ummary procedures should be used sparingly in complex antitrust litigation where motive and intent play leading roles, the "
435,," proof is largely in the hands of the alleged conspirators, and hostile witnesses thicken the plot.""); W. Penn Allegheny Health 
Sys., 627 F.3d at 99 (describing the rule-of-reason as ""fact intensive""); cf. King, 791 F.3d at 411 n.36 (describing the significance 
of fact finding in the rule of reason analysis)."
435,65," To recap, those issues are the decisions excluding the testimony of their economic expert and denying Aetna's motion to 
intervene. Additionally, the indirect-purchaser Appellants challenge the District Court orders decertifying the indirect-purchaser 
class and dismissing certain of the indirect purchasers' claims for lack of standing. Finally, GSK conditionally cross-appeals the 
Court's certification of the direct-purchaser class as well as the Court's conclusion that the indirect purchasers satisfy the 
predominance requirement of Rule 23. "
445,1," Neither party has advocated for a ""quick look"" approach to this case. "
446,2," An ancillary restraint is one that is ""subordinate and collateral to a separate, legitimate transaction"" and ""serves to make the 
main transaction more effective in accomplishing its purpose."" Rothery Storage & Van Co. v. Atlas Van Lines, Inc., 792 F.2d 
210, 224, 253 U.S. App. D.C. 142 (D.C. Cir. 1986). For example, Atlas Van Lines uses independent agents to move household 
goods between two points. Atlas does the advertising, finds the customers, sets the rates, chooses routes, collects revenue and 
pays the agents. It instituted a policy prohibiting agents from also contracting to handle interstate carriage on their own. The 
court held that this restraint was ""ancillary"" in that it enhanced the efficiency of the enterprise by eliminating the problem of the 
""free ride,"" i.e., agents using Atlas's reputation, equipment, facilities and services in conducting business for their own profit. "
449,3," At oral argument, one judge pointed out that it appeared that the district court had not addressed this argument because it was 
untimely. Oral Arg. Tr. at 11-13. "
451,4," Defendants have filed a separate motion to preclude trial of the unpled ""rim conspiracy"" claim. Doc. #190. That motion will be 
addressed below. "
452,5," One district court has called the application of the per se doctrine to joint ventures ""one of the darkest corners of antitrust law . 
. . an area that is unsettled, unclear, unwieldy and unequivocally complex."" In re ATM Fee Antitrust Litig., 554 F. Supp. 2d 1003, 
1007 (N.D. Cal. 2008) (internal quotation omitted). "
455,6," Merriam-Webster defines ""core"" as ""a basic, essential or enduring part."" https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/core . 
The Court has found no caselaw defining this term in a relevant legal context. "
457,7," Notably, in the course of deciding that MCEP's claim lacked the necessary plurality of actors, Judge Black found that the 
challenged restraints, ""managed care contracting and physician relations,"" were ""core functions"" of the joint venture under 
Dagher. Doc. #162, PageID#15932. The Sixth Circuit did not disturb this finding on appeal."
457,8," MCEP also argues that, because Defendants also argued on appeal—as an alternate ground for affirming Judge Black's 
opinion—that MCEP's claim was not subject to the per se rule, and because the Sixth Circuit did not discuss this alternate 
ground for affirmance, we should assume that the Sixth Circuit impliedly rejected it. Given the Sixth Circuit's explicit statement 
that the appeal concerned only the first element of the Sherman Act claim, i.e., plurality of actors, such an inference is 
unwarranted. Moreover, the Sixth Circuit was not required to address the alternate ground for affirmance. See Portman v. Cty, of 
Santa Clara, 995 F.2d 898, 910 (9th Cir. 1993) (""Although we may affirm the grant of summary judgment on any basis presented 
in the record, we are not obliged to do so.""). "
458,9," The Court notes that the Sixth Circuit did qualify its statement by saying that such restraints ""normally serve[] no proper 
business function."" 817 F.3d at 939 (emphasis added). "
462,10," MCEP maintains that these are not separate claims, but are merely ""additional evidence"" of the overarching conspiracy claim 
pled in the Amended Complaint. Given that the Amended Complaint already names all of the relevant parties as coconspirators, 
MCEP contends that no amendment was needed. "
472,1," The above-captioned cases were each filed in the Northern District of California. On October 24, 2016, all of the cases were 
reassigned to this Court in the interest of avoiding duplication of effort and conserving judicial resources. On November 28, 
2016, the Court held a conference and set forth a consolidated briefing schedule for all of the defendants to file motions to 
dismiss. Unless otherwise specified, the docket numbers and documents referenced herein shall refer to the docket in Banks v. County of 
San Mateo, Case No. 16-CV-4455 (N.D. Cal.)."
472,2," Plaintiffs are inmates and their families, and defendants are the counties that operate the county jails. To the extent the Court 
references specific allegations, the cases are referred to as follows: first, Banks v. San Mateo, No. 16-CV-4455, Dkt. No. 37 
(""Banks/San Mateo Second Amended Complaint"" or ""Banks/San Mateo SAC""); second, Thatcher v. Santa Clara, No. 16-CV-

Costa, No. 16-CV-4795, Dkt. No. 24 (""Harris/Contra Costa FAC""); and finally, Clark-Russell v. Alameda, No. 16-CV-4816, Dkt. 
No. 25 (""Clark-Russell/Alameda FAC"")."
472,3," On March 7, 2017, plaintiffs filed an administrative motion for leave to file a sur-reply to address defendants' arguments 
regarding the Tax Injunction Act, raised for the first time in their reply brief. Good cause having been shown, the Court GRANTS 
plaintiffs' motion for leave to file a sur-reply and considers in full plaintiffs' arguments in their filing at Docket Number 53-2 as 
their sur-reply."
472,4," The parties each filed requests for judicial notice in connection with their papers on the instant motions. Defendants seek notice 
of the following documents (Dkt. Nos. 42 (""DRJN"") and 52 (""SDRJN"")): (i) Exhibit A, FCC 12-167 Notice of Proposed 
Rulemaking; (ii) Exhibit B, FCC 13-114 Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking; (iii) Exhibit C, FCC 15-

Agreement with Global Tel*Link; (xvi) Exhibit P, FCC Inmate Telephone Service Guide; and (xvii) SDRJN Exhibit A, Alameda 
Contract Amendment with Global Tel*Link. Defendants argue that each of these documents is noticeable because each ""can be accurately and readily determined from 
sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned."" Fed. R. Evid. 201(b). Specifically, Exhibits E—J are court records, 
see Harris v. Cty. of Orange, 682 F.3d 1126, 1132 (9th Cir. 2012); Exhibits A—D & P are federal agency records, see Am.-Arab 
Anti-Discrimination Comm. v. Reno, 70 F.3d 1045, 1069-70 (9th Cir. 1995); and Exhibit K—O and SDRJN Ex. A are public 
county contracting records, see Nat. Res. Def. Council v. Kempthorne, 539 F. Supp. 2d 1155, 1167 (E.D. Cal. 2008). Plaintiffs 
oppose only Exhibits K, L, and M, arguing that the truth of the contents of such documents and the manner in which the bidding 
actually occurred are in dispute. The Court finds that the documents presented are properly subject to judicial notice, but the 
Court does not accept as true the statements made in such documents. Plaintiffs seek judicial notice of the following: (a) Exhibit 1, Santa Clara and Global Tel*Link contract; (b) Exhibit 2, Second 
Amendment to Santa Clara and Global Tel*Link contract; (c) Exhibit 3, Alameda and Global Tel*Link contract; and (d) Exhibit 4, 
Amendment to San Mateo and Securus contract. Defendants do not oppose. The Court takes notice of the existence of such 
contracts, but not of any facts contained therein. Id. "

476,6," The TIA was enacted in 1937 based on concerns that, if injunctive relief from state taxes were available, ""state tax 
administration might be thrown into disarray,"" and ""'[d]uring the pendency of the federal suit the collection of revenue under the 
challenged law might be obstructed, with consequent damage to the State's budget, and perhaps a shift to the State of the risk 
of taxpayer insolvency.'"" Bidart Bros. v. Cal. Apple Comm'n, 73 F.3d 925, 929-30 (9th Cir. 1996) (quoting Rosewell v. LaSalle 
Nat'l Bank, 450 U.S. 503, 527, 101 S. Ct. 1221, 67 L. Ed. 2d 464 (1981))."
476,7," Plaintiffs also argued that the TIA applies only to state, rather than county actions and assessments. However, it is well-settled 
that the TIA can apply to assessments imposed by county boards. See Bidart, 73 F.3d at 931 (discussing case where county 
board's imposition of a health tax was found to be covered by the TIA). "
479,8," Prior to Town of Hallie and currently in other contexts, the Supreme Court applied a two-prong test to determine whether the 
state action doctrine barred liability for antitrust claims under the Sherman Act. Specifically, the Supreme Court required both (i) 
a clear articulation of an affirmatively expressed policy and (ii) active supervision by the State. See N. Carolina, 135 S. Ct. at 
1110. The supervision rule stemmed ""from the recognition that '[w]here a private party is engaging in anticompetitive activity, 
there is a real danger that he is acting to further his own interests, rather than the governmental interests of the State.'"" Id. at 
1112 (citation omitted). In Town of Hallie, the Supreme Court exempted municipalities from the ""active supervision"" requirement 
holding that municipalities are subject exclusively to the ""clear articulation"" requirement. The Supreme Court reasoned that the 
prong was not necessary in such cases because there was ""little or no danger that [a municipality would be] involved in a private 
price-fixing arrangement. The only real danger [was] that it [would] seek to further purely parochial public interests at the 
expense of more overriding state goals."" Town of Hallie, 471 U.S. at 47 (emphasis in original). It found the danger, however, to 
be minimal ""because of the requirement that the municipality act pursuant to a clearly articulated state policy."" Id. The Court can 
conceive of situations in which the justification for exempting municipalities from the ""active supervision"" requirement do not 
apply. This, however, is not that case. "
480,9," In 1989, section (d) was further amended to include not only telephone companies but also ""pay telephone provider(s)"" to 
correct an apparent gap in the statute. Stats. 1989, c. 127."
480,10," In any event, the Court finds that the conduct of which plaintiffs complain further fails to state a claim under section 1 of the 
Sherman Act. HN15[
] ""A claim under Section 1 of the Sherman Act requires proof of 'concerted action,' defined as having a conscious commitment to a common scheme designed to achieve an unlawful objective. Concerted, multilateral action in 
violation of the Act occurs when two or more entities that previously pursued their own interests separately combine to act as 
one for their common benefit in the restraint of trade."" 54 Am. Jur. 2d Monopolies and Restraints of Trade § 31 (2d ed. 2017). 
""Sherman Act § 1 prohibits conspiracies and agreements that unreasonably restrain trade."" Thurman Indus., Inc. v. Pay 'N Pak 
Stores, Inc., 875 F.2d 1369, 1373 (9th Cir. 1989). To establish a Section 1 claim, a plaintiff must demonstrate the following three 
elements: ""(1) an agreement, conspiracy, or combination among two or more persons or distinct business entities; (2) which is 
intended to harm or unreasonably restrain competition; and (3) which actually causes injury to competition, beyond the impact 
on the claimant, within a field of commerce in which the claimant is engaged (i.e., 'antitrust injury')."" McGlinchy v. Shell Chem. 
Co., 845 F.2d 802, 811 (9th Cir. 1988). Plaintiffs concede that defendants have the authority to enter into exclusive contracts with a single telephone company or 
provider. There is, therefore, no unlawful intent to harm or unreasonably restrain competition. Rather, as the Seventh Circuit 
explained in a similar case: Indeed, the plaintiffs' real argument has nothing to do with any horizontal conspiracy; it is rather that a monopolist, namely 
the State of Illinois (and its subdivisions), exercising as it does an iron control over access to the inmate market, has rented 
pieces of the market to different phone companies . . . . States [*27]  and other public agencies do not violate the antitrust 
laws by charging fees or taxes that exploit the monopoly force that is the definition of government. Arsberry, 244 F.3d at 566. "
481,11," Plaintiffs rely on McGuire v. Ameritech Services, Inc., 253 F. Supp. 2d 988 (S.D. Ohio 2003) and Judge Fitzgerald's opinion in 
similar cases in the Central District of California, Salazar v. Los Angeles, No. 15-CV-9003-MWF, Dkt. No. 48, 2016 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 190608 (C.D. Cal. Sept. 26, 2016), which both deferred ruling on the state action doctrine issue until further factual 
development. Both courts found that it appeared to be a ""question of fact as to whether, in giving Defendant counties the 
authority to regulate commissions from phone calls via section 4025(d), the State contemplated that Defendant counties would in 
turn establish phone calling systems on a monopolistic basis."" Order, Salazar, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 190608 [slip op] at *31; 
McGuire, 253 F. Supp. 2d at 1017-18. Here, however, plaintiffs concede defendants' authority to enter into contracts on a 
monopolistic basis and dispute only their ability to charge allegedly ""exorbitant"" commissions. In any event, such a determination 
can be made at this time, given the parties' arguments, lack of allegations to the contrary, and the legislative history behind 
Penal Code section 4025."
481,12," As an initial matter, the parties dispute whether the challenged ""commissions"" should be considered ""taxes"" for the purposes 
of plaintiffs' First Amendment challenge. The cases upon which plaintiffs rely for this position are either in the context of actual 
taxes, or legislative or regulatory actions taken by the government, requiring payment of a licensing fee prior to being granted 
permission to partake in a constitutionally protected activity. See Minneapolis Star, 460 U.S. at 577; see also Murdock v. 
Pennsylvania, 319 U.S. 105, 109-10, 63 S. Ct. 870, 87 L. Ed. 1292 (1943) (license tax on distribution of religious material); 
Baldwin v. Redwood City, 540 F.2d 1360, 1366 (9th Cir. 1976) (regulation imposing restrictions and requiring permits before 
homeowners and residents could post temporary political posters and signs); TK's Video, Inc. v. Denton Cty., 24 F.3d 705, 707 
(5th Cir. 1994) (licensing requirements for adult book and video stores); Nat'l Awareness Found. v. Abrams, 50 F.3d 1159, 1165 
(2d Cir. 1995) (registration and annual fees for professional solicitors in the employ of professional fundraisers); Sentinel 
Comm'cs Co. v. Watts, 936 F.2d 1189, 1205 (11th Cir. 1991) (licensing fees and insurance requirements for placement of coin-
operated news racks); E. Conn. Citizen Action Grp. v. Powers, 723 F.2d 1050, 1056 (2d Cir. 1983) (licensing fees to use forum 
for protesting). Defendants argue that such bear no relation to the purchase of services—namely ICS phone access—from 
private entities with whom the defendants have entered into contracts. The Court finds that the characterization of the commissions as a ""tax"" or a ""fee"" is inconsequential, and the cases make no 
such distinction. Rather, HN16[
] the concern is whether the government is conditioning the exercise of a First Amendment right on the payment of a fee that is unconnected with the administrative costs of overseeing the exercise of that right or any "
482,," other legitimate governmental interest. See Minneapolis Star, 460 U.S. at 582 (holding that ""tax that burdens rights protected by 
the First Amendment cannot stand unless the burden is necessary to achieve an overriding governmental interest"")."
482,13," Plaintiffs rely heavily on Judge Fitzgerald's order in the Central District cases. Order, Salazar, Dkt. No. 48. There, Judge 
Fitzgerald agreed with the plaintiffs that the motion to dismiss the First Amendment claims rested on the application of the 
Turner analysis, but he also found persuasive the noted dicta, which contains a reference to the threshold ""right to telephone 
access in the jails."" Id. at *16-18. This Court respectfully declines to join him. "
483,14," Significantly, because the telephone companies themselves are not part of this litigation and the relief plaintiffs seek would 
only enjoin defendants from collecting commissions as part of their contractual arrangement with the telephone companies, the 
telephone companies could, in theory, continue charging the same ""exorbitant"" rates, retaining all profits without remitting a 
portion to the counties for the inmate welfare funds."
483,15," Plaintiffs further argue that a standard lower than the Turner standard should apply to the call recipient plaintiffs because they 
are not in prison, and, therefore, the same governmental concerns are inapposite. Not so. Necessarily, each one of the calls at 
issue would involve a call recipient outside of prison. If the Court were to accept plaintiffs' position, it would render the entire 
Turner analysis nugatory in this context. In any event, the Court's ruling here is based on a finding that the commissions charged 
do not impinge upon or restrict the exercise of any First Amendment right. This finding applies equally to the inmate plaintiffs as 
it does to the call recipient plaintiffs."
483,16," At oral arguments, plaintiffs attempted to clarify that they were only raising one claim, namely that there exists an 
unconstitutional condition that is coercive because it involves a ""taking"" of their money to exercise their right to communicate 
with others. Nonetheless, given the lack of clarity, the Court addresses both. "
484,17," Plaintiffs cite four cases which they argue support their position that an obligation to pay money gives rise to a Takings claim 
under the Fifth Amendment. However, two of these four cases pre-date the Supreme Court's opinion in Eastern Enterprises, 
which was decided on June 25, 1998. See Phillips v. Wash. Legal Found., 524 U.S. 156, 172, 118 S. Ct. 1925, 141 L. Ed. 2d 
174 (1998) (decided June 15, 1998 and holding that the interest accrued in certain funds was the private property of the owner, 
but explicitly expressed no view as to whether such funds were taken by the state); Webb's Fabulous Pharms., Inc. v. Beckwith, 
449 U.S. 155, 164, 101 S. Ct. 446, 66 L. Ed. 2d 358 (1980) (holding that a county violated the Takings Clause in taking interest 
earned on interpleader funds). More importantly, neither of these cases is analogous to the case at hand. Both involve a 
governmental entity taking for its own use monetary interest generated from a fund. In discussing Webb's Fabulous, upon which 
Phillips relies, the dissenting justices in Eastern Enterprises explained thus: The Court has also made clear that the Clause can apply to monetary interest generated from a fund into which a private 
individual has paid money. But the monetary interest at issue there arose out of the operation of a specific, separately 
identifiable fund of money. And the government took that interest for itself. Here there is no specific fund of money; there is 
only a general liability; and that liability runs not to the Government, but to third parties. E. Enters., 524 U.S. at 555 (Breyer, J., dissenting) (internal citation omitted); see also id. at 539 (""The Coal Act does not 
appropriate, transfer, or encumber an estate in land (e.g., a lien on a particular piece of property), a valuable interest in an 
intangible (e.g., intellectual property), or even a bank account or accrued interest. The law simply imposes an obligation to 
perform an act, the payment of benefits."") (Kennedy, J., concurring in part, dissenting in part). The third case was issued by the 
Ninth Circuit only two months after Eastern Enterprises, and is similarly in the context of taking interest income payments from a 
fund. Schneider v. Cal. Dep't of Corrections, 151 F.3d 1194, 1201 (9th Cir. 1998) (finding that state's appropriation of interest 
income payments implicated Takings Clause). Finally, the last case addressed whether money was a property interest for 
purposes of a procedural due process claim rather than a Takings claim. McGuire, 253 F. Supp. 2d at 1004. Furthermore, McGuire and other cases have also recognized that where, as here, the payment is voluntary, there is no such 
taking. Id. (""The prospective recipient of a collect call is in complete control over whether she chooses to accept the call and 
thereby relinquish her money to pay for it. There is no taking of which to speak, such as where the government confiscates 
property or forecloses its commercial use by fiat or legislation, and any argument that the State has created a property interest in 
free or cheap collect calls would not be well taken.""); see also Managed Pharm. Care v. Sebelius, 716 F.3d 1235, 1252 (9th Cir. 
2013) (rejected Takings claim related to reimbursement rates because participation in Medicaid is voluntary); Godoy v. Horel, 
No. 09-CV-4793-PJH, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20465, 2010 WL 890148, at *2-3 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 8, 2010), aff'd, 442 F. App'x 326 
(9th Cir. 2011) (finding no taking where defendants' raised the price of coffee at the prison canteen because plaintiffs were 
aware of the prices and authorized expenditures). "
485,18," In the related Central District cases, Judge Fitzgerald credited plaintiffs' arguments regarding Proposition 26, finding that state 
courts should be given the opportunity to address the issue as to whether the fees are impermissible taxes under Proposition 26, 
and if so, then plaintiffs have successfully pled an Equal Protections claim. Order, Kaelin, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 192339 Dkt. 
No. 59, at *8-10 (Dec. 20, 2016)."
485,19," Plaintiffs represent that they are challenging the fees imposed here in parallel state court proceedings as impermissible taxes 
pursuant to Proposition 26. In a joint statement filed in the Central District cases, the parties represented that these cases have 
been consolidated with the five Central District cases in those parallel state court proceedings. Joint Statement, Salazar, Dkt. 
No. 69 (July 31, 2017). They further represented that the plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint on July 21, 2017, and that 
defendants were in the process of reviewing such complaint. Id."
485,20," Plaintiffs further argue that the commissions are used for ""either the Inmate Welfare Fund or for general jail maintenance,"" and 
complain that plaintiffs pay a disproportionately higher amount to support the same simply because they are communicating with 
inmates. (Dkt. No. 46 at 55.) As an initial matter, as set forth above, the commissions collected by the counties must be used for 
special purposes within the prisons. If the counties are violating that mandate, plaintiffs may have claims under state law. 
However, defendants' ultimate use of these commissions is, in these circumstances, not relevant with regard to an Equal 
Protection challenge. The relevant inquiry is whether they are similarly situated to the public-at-large. For the reasons set forth 
herein, they are not. "
486,21," Plaintiffs also argue that an Equal Protection claim based on a First Amendment violation need not involve view point 
discrimination, citing United States v. Nat'l Treasury Empls. Union, 513 U.S. 454, 115 S. Ct. 1003, 130 L. Ed. 2d 964 (1995) for 
the proposition that actions that infringe on protected speech can violate the First Amendment, even if they are content-neutral. 
National Treasury, however, does not involve an Equal Protection claim. While an independent First Amendment claim can 
implicate other impingements of free speech, plaintiffs provide no authority that an Equal Protection claim premised on the First 
Amendment can be based on content neutral restrictions. "
491,1," See DGA Basic Agreement Side Letter 15 (RJN, Ex. 3) "
495,2," Although VidAngel does not address the rule of reason in their opposition, Defense conceded at oral argument that the vertical 
agreements at issue are analyzed under the rule of reason. "
522,1," At the hearing, LinkedIn pointed to the fact that other companies operate in the data analytics field without making use of 
LinkedIn’s member data. But as hiQ pointed out, these companies employ entirely different business models. For example, one 
company highlighted by LinkedIn, Glint, creates its own data by taking surveys of employees working for its clients. Requiring "
523,," hiQ to rebuild its business on an entirely different business model, such as that employed by Glint, from scratch would constitute 
harm comparable to simply going out of business. LinkedIn also suggests that hiQ could make use of other sources of data, 
such as Facebook. But while Facebook may have a comparable number of professionals using its service, LinkedIn has not 
argued that the professional data available at Facebook is of a similar quality to that available at LinkedIn. Moreover, if 
LinkedIn’s view of the law is correct, nothing would prevent Facebook from barring hiQ in the same way LinkedIn has."
523,2, LinkedIn does not claim a proprietary interest in its users’ profiles.
523,3," Though the ""Do Not Broadcast"" feature makes it less likely to draw immediate attention to a profile update, it does nothing to 
prevent an employer, or any other third-party, from visiting an employee’s page periodically to determine whether significant 
changes have been made. "
524,4," LinkedIn argues hiQ signed up as a LinkedIn user and is thus bound by the User Agreement. But LinkedIn has since 
terminated hiQ’s user status. LinkedIn has not demonstrated that hiQ’s aggregation of data from LinkedIn’s public profiles is 
dependent on its status as a LinkedIn user."
524,5," See, e.g., Tom Towers,  [**13] Thousands Sign up for Community Service After Failing to Read Terms and Conditions, Metro 
News (July 14, 2017, 11:12 PM), http://metro.co.uk/2017/07/14/thousands-sign-up-for-community-service-after-failing-to-read-
terms-and-conditions-6781034/ ."
524,6," As LinkedIn notes, because its computers are connected to the Internet and affect interstate commerce, they are ""protected 
computers"" under the CFAA. See United States v. Nosal (Nosal I), 676 F.3d 854, 859 (9th Cir. 2012). hiQ does not dispute this 
fact. "
526,7," Although there is no indication of any current threat of criminal prosecution in this case as LinkedIn thus far has alluded only to 
possible civil enforcement of the CFAA, a construction of the CFAA must take into account the fact the statute may be enforced 
criminally and that its interpretation would apply uniformly to criminal as well as civil enforcement. See, e.g., Ratzlaf v. United 
States, 510 U.S. 135, 143, 114 S. Ct. 655, 126 L. Ed. 2d 615 (1994) (""A term appearing in several places in a statutory text is 
generally read the same way each time it appears. We have even stronger cause to construe a single formulation . . . the same 
way each time it is called into play.""); F.C.C. v. American Broadcasting Co., 347 U.S. 284, 296, 74 S. Ct. 593, 98 L. Ed. 699 
(1954) (rejecting notion that ""the same substantive language has one meaning if criminal prosecutions are brought . . . and quite 
a different meaning"" in civil action by private party); U.S. v. Charnay, 537 F.2d 341, 348 (9th Cir. 1976) (agreeing there was ""no 
reasonable basis that some different interpretation [of Rule 10b-5] should apply to a criminal action than in a civil action"" for 
meaning of ""deceptive device"" under 15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)). "
527,8," LinkedIn argued at the hearing on this motion that the likelihood of these negative consequences is lessened because violation 
of the CFAA may be invoked only where the alleged violation ""caused . . . loss . . . aggregating at least $5,000 in value."" 18 
U.S.C. § 1030(c)(4)(A)(i)(1). However, a violation of § 1030(a)(2) is punishable as a misdemeanor without regard to amount of 
loss. 18 U.S.C. § 1030(c)(2)(A). Although felony charges or a civil action may not be brought unless there is a loss of at least 
$5,000, see § 1030(c)(4)(A)(i)(1) and 18 U.S.C. § 1030(g), the CFAA defines ""loss"" broadly as ""any reasonable cost to any 
victim, including the cost of responding to an offense, conducting a damage assessment, and restoring the data, program, 
system, or information to its condition prior to the offense, and any revenue lost, cost incurred, or other consequential damages 
incurred because of interruption of service."" 18 U.S.C. § 1030(e)(11). As a number of courts have explained, this ""broadly 
worded provision plainly contemplates consequential damages of the type sought by [Plaintiff] — costs incurred as part of the 
response to a CFAA violation, including the investigation of an offense."" A.V. ex rel. Vanderhye v. iParadigms, LLC, 562 F.3d 
630, 646 (4th Cir. 2009). Because merely investigating a potential violation may satisfy the statutory damage threshold, it is 
unlikely that the $5,000 requirement will provide a meaningful check on the potential reach of the CFAA. "
528,9," To take the analogy above another step, when a business displays a sign in a storefront window for the public to view, it may 
not prohibit on pain of trespass a viewer from photographing that sign or viewing it with glare reducing sunglasses. "
529,10," Circumvention of a technological barrier does not automatically give rise to a CFAA violation. See Nosal II, 844 F.3d at 1038 
(rejecting at least in dicta the argument that ""the CFAA only criminalizes access where the party circumvents a technological 
access barrier"")."
529,11," In addition to technological self-help, LinkedIn may be able to pursue other legal remedies. For example, LinkedIn argues that 
if it cannot invoke the CFAA to prevent unauthorized access by bots, it may be left open to denial of service attacks. However, 
the CFAA creates liability against ""[w]hoever"" — whether access is authorized or not — ""causes the transmission of a program, 
information, code, or command, and as a result of such conduct, intentionally causes damage without authorization, to a 
protected computer."" 18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(5)(A). Additionally, such attacks are likely remediable under, e.g., the common law tort 
of trespass to chattel. Trespass to chattel requires a plaintiff to prove that a defendant intentionally interfered with plaintiff’s use 
or possession of personal property, with resultant injury. See California Civil Jury Instructions 2101; Itano v. Colonial Yacht 
Anchorage, 267 Cal. App. 2d 84, 90, 72 Cal. Rptr. 823 (1968). California Courts have recognized that trespass to chattel may be 
accomplished through purely electronic means. See Thrifty-Tel, Inc. v. Bezenek, 46 Cal. App. 4th 1559, 54 Cal. Rptr. 2d 468 
(1996) (upholding trespass to chattel verdict in favor of plaintiff where defendants ""employed computer technology"" to crack 
access and authorization codes and make long-distance phone calls without paying for them)."
529,12," hiQ also argues that the interpretation of the CFAA that LinkedIn urges should be rejected under the canon of constitutional 
avoidance, because it raises potentially serious problems under the First Amendment. See Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida 
Gulf Coast Bldg. & Constr. Trades Council, 485 U.S. 568, 575, 108 S. Ct. 1392, 99 L. Ed. 2d 645 (1988) (""[W]here an otherwise 
acceptable construction of a statute would raise serious constitutional problems, the Court will construe the statute to avoid such 
problems unless such construction is plainly contrary to the intent of Congress.""). Because the Court rejects LinkedIn’s 
interpretation on the grounds discussed above, it need not reach hiQ’s First Amendment arguments. The Court observes, 
however, that the threshold issue of state action presents a serious hurdle to any direct First Amendment claim against LinkedIn 
in this case. See, e.g., Brunette v. Humane Society of Ventura County, 294 F.3d 1205, 1210 (9th Cir. 2002) (private party may 
be deemed to have engaged in state action if it is a willful participant in joint action with the government; if the government has 
insinuated itself into a position of interdependence with it; and if it performs functions traditionally and exclusively reserved to the 
states); Brentwood Academy v. Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Ass'n, 531 U.S. 288, 300-301, 121 S. Ct. 924, 148 L. Ed. 
2d 807 (2001) (state action may be found where private entity is controlled by an agency of the state, when its activity results 
from the state’s exercise of coercive power, when the state provides encouragement, or when government is ""entwined"" in the 
entity’s policies, management, or control). LinkedIn is not a state official or governmental agency; it is a private party and there is 
no evidence that the CFAA has served to compel or encourage LinkedIn to withdraw hiQ’s authorization to access its website. 
Compare Brentwood Academy, 531 U.S. at 300 (private party’s actions may be characterized as state action ""when the State 
provides significant encouragement, either overt or covert"") (citation and quotation omitted) with Blum v. Yaretsky, 457 U.S. 991, 
1005, 102 S. Ct. 2777, 73 L. Ed. 2d 534 (1982) (nursing homes’ decisions to discharge patients were not state action because 
they were made by private parties according to professional standards not established by the state, and the simple fact ""[t]hat 
the State responds to such actions by adjusting benefits does not render it responsible for those actions""). However, the same 
interpretation of the statute would apply uniformly to both civil and criminal actions, see supra n.7, and a criminal prosecution 
under the CFAA would undoubtedly constitute state action. Thus, because the act of viewing a publicly accessible website is 
likely protected by the First Amendment (see, e.g., Packingham, 137 S.Ct. at 1737 (statute’s prohibition on sex offender access 
to social media websites raised serious First Amendment concerns because, inter alia, ""[s]ocial media allows users to gain 
access to information . . . .""); Kleindienst v. Mandel, 408 U.S. 753, 762-63, 92 S. Ct. 2576, 33 L. Ed. 2d 683 (1972) (noting the 
""variety of contexts [in which] this Court has referred to a First Amendment right to receive information and ideas"") (quotation 
omitted); First Nat'l Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U.S. 765, 782, 98 S. Ct. 1407, 55 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1978) (the First Amendment 
plays a role to protect ""not only"" ""individual self-expression but also . . . affording public access to discussion, debate, and the "
530,," dissemination of information and ideas""); Board of Edu., Island Trees Union Free School Dist. No. 26 v. Pico, 457 U.S. 853, 867, 
102 S. Ct. 2799, 73 L. Ed. 2d 435 (1982) (noting that the right to receive information ""is an inherent corollary of the rights of free 
speech and press that are explicitly guaranteed by the Constitution""); cf. Branzburg v. Hayes, 408 U.S. 665, 684-85, 92 S. Ct. 
2646, 33 L. Ed. 2d 626 (1972) (explaining that ""[n]ewsmen have no constitutional right of access to the scenes of crime or 
disaster when the general public is excluded,"" perhaps suggesting that the right extends at least to information to which the 
general public has access), the doctrine of constitutional avoidance might well be properly considered in interpreting the CFAA, 
even if the First Amendment were not directly implicated in this particular case. See Sosa v. DIRECTV, Inc., 437 F.3d 923, 932, 
942 (9th Cir. 2006) (statute should be construed to avoid burdening First Amendment interests where possible). The doctrine of 
constitutional avoidance, if applicable, would substantiate the Court’s doubt about the applicability of the CFAA to hiQ’s conduct."
530,13," For the same reasons, the Court concludes that hiQ has raised serious questions about whether provisions of the California 
analog to the CFAA, California Penal Code § 502, referring to unauthorized access apply to the conduct here. Cf. Chrisman v. 
City of Los Angeles, 155 Cal.App.4th 29, 34, 65 Cal. Rptr. 3d 701 (2007) (noting that ""[s]ection 502 defines ""access’ in terms 
redolent of ""hacking’ or breaking into a computer""). Though the statute also includes a provision that 17 prohibits ""knowingly 
access[ing] and without permission tak[ing], cop[ying], or mak[ing] use of any data from a computer, computer system, or 
computer network,"" Cal. Pen. Code § 502(c)(2), the Court similarly concludes there are serious questions about whether these 
provisions criminalize viewing public portions of a website. "
533,14," hiQ also asserts a common law claim of tortious interference with contract, but the California Supreme Court has held that 
such a claim is foreclosed as long as the defendant ""had a legitimate business purpose which justified its actions."" Quelimane 
Co. v. Stewart Title Guar. Co., 19 Cal. 4th 26, 57, 77 Cal. Rptr. 2d 709, 960 P.2d 513 (1998). For that reason, the analysis of the 
tortious interference claim simply overlaps with the analysis of the unfair competition claim: if LinkedIn acted for an improper 
anticompetitive purpose, then the tortious interference claim may lie; if, on the other hand, it acted out of legitimate concern for 
member privacy, then the claim fails. "
537,1," On July 28, 2016, the court: granted the motion to certify the settlement class (ECF No. 413) filed by Cole's Wexford; granted 
the motion for final approval of settlement between the settlement plaintiff class and UPMC (ECF No. 414); and issued a final 
judgment order with respect to UPMC on all claims against it for purposes of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 58(a) (ECF No. 
415). UPMC is, therefore, no longer a named defendant in this case."
537,2," Highmark and Cole's Wexford each filed a motion to file under seal various submissions with respect to Highmark's motion for 
summary judgment. (ECF Nos. 454, 468.) The court granted those motions. (ECF Nos. 454, 469.) These citations are citations 
to the redacted versions of Highmark's filings, which are accessible to the public. The court in this opinion will cite to and quote 
from the under seal versions of these filings when appropriate."
537,3," These citations are citations to the redacted versions of Cole's Wexford's filings, which are accessible to the public. The court in 
this opinion will cite to and quote from the under seal versions of these filings when appropriate. See supra n.2."
537,4," This citation is to the redacted version of the parties' combined concise statement of material facts. The court herein when 
appropriate will cite to and quote from the combined concise statement of material facts that was filed under seal in this case. 
(ECF No. 488.) "
538,5," In the parties' combined concise statement of material facts, Highmark numbered its paragraphs starting on page five ""1"" 
through ""126."" (ECF No. 488 at 5-44.) Plaintiff in its separate statement of facts numbered its paragraphs ""1"" through ""89"" (id. at 
45-65). The court to differentiate whether it is citing to Highmark's statement of facts in the combined concise statements or 
plaintiff's statement of facts in the combined concise statements will refer to Highmark's paragraphs by number alone, e.g., 
""(CCSMF (ECF No. 488) ¶ 16)"" and plaintiff's paragraphs by inserting ""pl.'s"" before identifying the paragraph number, e.g., 
""(CCSMF (ECF No. 488) pl.'s ¶ 16)"". "
543,6," The individual conversion rates are not at issue in this case; rather, it is HHIC's small-group health insurance rates that form the 
basis for plaintiff's measure of damages. (ECF No. 474 at 19 (""Plaintiff's injury was not caused by any such review of individual 
conversion rates (or by the approval of [the] PPO application)."") Plaintiff in the third amended complaint alleges that it and the members of the putative class paid HHIC ""small group plan 
premiums,"" and there are no allegations with respect to individual conversion policies. (ECF No. 286 ¶ 11.) As discussed above, 
the parties agree that the PID had the authority to review and approve individual conversion policies. (CCSMF (ECF No. 488) 
pl.'s ¶ 48.) Plaintiff in the third amended complaint sets forth the following factual allegations with respect to its injury: This discontinue-and-migrate strategy for small group plans harmed the Plaintiff class. Cole's and other purchasers of small 
group insurance coverage in the Plaintiff [*24]  class paid artificially inflated, supracompetitive premiums to Highmark 
Health Insurance Co. (and possibly to other for-profit Highmark insurers), and these premiums were not filed with the 
PID. Once Highmark was free of both meaningful competition (as a result of its conspiracy with UPMC) and regulatory 
scrutiny (as a result of its migration strategy), it was able to charge supracompetitive premiums to its small group 
customers. But for the conspiracy, these purchasers of small group plans would have paid lower premiums to Highmark 
Health Insurance Co. or other Highmark entities whose small group premium amounts were not subject to any rate filing 
requirement. (ECF No. 276 ¶ 242 (emphasis added).) Plaintiff claims injury based upon rates that were not subject to the PID's approval, and 
agrees that the individual conversion policies were subject to the review and approval of the PID. (Id.; CCSMF (ECF No. 488) 
pl.'s ¶ 48.) The individual conversion policies, therefore, do not form the basis of plaintiff's measure of damages in this case. "
545,7," ""ClientSpecific l"" and ""ClientSpecific2"" factors were not necessarily related to health status, but for purposes of ensuring that 
HHIC did not exceed the 25% cap on health status factors, which HHIC agreed to in the agreement dated April 26, 2010, which 
is discussed below, HHIC considered these factors to be related to health status. (CCSMF (ECF No. 488) pl.'s ¶ 79.) "
551,8," As discussed above, HHIC—pursuant to the agreement dated April 26, 2010—agreed to certain limitations with respect to its 
small group rates charged during this time period. (CCSMF (ECF No. 488) ¶¶ 115-20.) HHIC's small group rates were not 
statutorily required to be filed with the PID during that timeframe. 40 P.S. § 3803.303(d) (2010). "

553,10," In Cantor: Justice Stevens wrote for the plurality; Justices Stewart, Powell, and Rehnquest dissented from the plurality opinion; 
Chief Justice Berger concurred in the judgment and concurred in part; and Justice Blackmun concurred in the judgment. Cantor 
v. Detroit Edison Co., 428 U.S. 579, 593, 96 S. Ct. 3110, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1141 (1976). The Second Circuit Court of Appeals explained the division of the Court in Cantor as follows: In Cantor, the plurality held that a tariff filed by an electric utility could not evade scrutiny under the antitrust laws simply 
because it was filed in accordance with state law and approved by a state agency. The Cantor plurality stated that "
554,," nothing in the Noerr opinion implies that the mere fact that a state regulatory agency may approve a proposal included 
in a tariff, and thereby require that the proposal be implemented until a revised tariff is filed and approved, is a 
sufficient reason for conferring antitrust immunity on the proposed conduct. Id. Chief Justice Burger did not concur in that portion of the plurality's opinion discussing Noerr-Pennington, but his 
objection went to the plurality's construction of the ""state [*61]  action"" exemption doctrine under Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S. 
341, 63 S.Ct. 307, 87 L.Ed. 315 (1943), and he said nothing in disagreement with the plurality's interpretation of Noerr. 
Justice Blackmun's concurrence also did not address Noerr, but rather would rely on ""a rule of reason, taking it as a general 
proposition that state-sanctioned anticompetitive activity must fall like any other if its potential harms outweigh its benefits."" 
428 U.S. at 610, 96 S.Ct. at 3127. Litton Systems, Inc. v. Am. Tel. and Tel. Co., 700 F.2d 785, 808 (2d Cir. 1983). "
556,11," The undisputed evidence of record shows that: Highmark submitted its PPO applications to the PID and the DOH for their 
review; the PID and the DOH reviewed those applications; and Highmark engaged in negotiations with the PID with respect to its 
approval of those applications. It is not necessary for the court to determine as a matter of law whether Highmark's conduct in 
submitting the PPO applications to the PID and the DOH was constitutionally-protected petitioning because plaintiff does not 
claim any injury caused by that conduct. Plaintiff at trial, therefore, will not be permitted to argue to the jury that Highmark's 
submission of its PPO applications to the PID and the DOH and its negotiations with respect to the agreement dated April 26, 
2010, with the PID constituted anticompetitive conduct in violation of the Sherman Act."
556,12," The Second Circuit Court of Appeals in Litton Systems, Inc. v. AT & T Co., 700 F.2d 785 (2d Cir.1983), explained: [I]n this case, as in Continental Ore Co. v. Union Carbide & Carbon Corp., 370 U.S. 690, 707, 82 S.Ct. 1404, 1414, 8 
L.Ed.2d 777 (1962), the Noerr-Pennington doctrine is ""plainly inapposite"" because AT & T was ""engaged in private 
commercial activity, no element of which involved seeking to procure the passage or enforcement of laws."" The decision 
to impose and maintain the interface tariff was made in the AT & T boardroom, not at the FCC; AT & T's power to 
exclude Litton and other competitors from the telephone terminal equipment market resulted not from the FCC's regulatory 
authority but from AT & T's exclusive control of the telephone network. AT & T cannot cloak its actions in Noerr-Pennington 
immunity simply because it is required, as a regulated monopoly, to disclose publicly its rates and operating procedures. 
The fact that the FCC might ultimately set aside a tariff filing does not transform AT & T's independent decisions as to how 
it will conduct its business into a ""request"" for governmental action or an ""expression"" of political opinion. Similarly, the 
FCC's failure to strike down a tariff at the time of its filing does not make the [*70]  conduct lawful, particularly where, as in 
this case, the agency specifically declines to rule on a tariff's legality. "

557,13," This court in three other opinions issued in this case applied the filed rate doctrine to claims asserted or proposed by plaintiff. 
(ECF Nos. 240, 284, 301.) One treatise noted that the court's opinions dated September 27, 2013, (ECF No. 240), and August 
21, 2014, (ECF No. 284) applied the filed rate doctrine to claims in this case even though the ""'state action' prongs [were]...not 
shown to be satisfied."" PHILLIP E. AREEDA & HERBERT HOVENKAMP, ANTITRUST LAW ¶ 247 (Supp. 2017). ""Under the state action 
doctrine, private entities participating in state-administered price regulation can assert antitrust immunity if, inter alia, 'the State 
provides active supervision of anticompetitive conduct undertaken by private actors.'"" McCray v. Fidelity Nat'l Title Ins. Co., 682 
F.3d 229, 238 n.6 (3d Cir. 2012). According to Areeda and Hovenkamp: ""Extending the [filed rate] doctrine to state agencies 
raises the troublesome issues that rate filings may serve to confer an effective antitrust immunity in situations where antitrust's 
'state action' doctrine would not apply."" IA PHILLIP E. AREEDA & HERBERT HOVENKAMP, ANTITRUST LAW ¶ 247e (4th ed. 2013). 
Areeda and Hovenkamp explain that ""[t]he most sensible approach would be to limit application of the filed rate doctrine as 
applied to state regulators only when the regulatory regime in question would qualify for state action immunity."" Id. This court is bound to follow the decisions of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. In McCray, the court of appeals affirmed 
the decision of the district court to apply the filed rate doctrine to bar federal antitrust claims based upon rates filed with the 
Delaware Insurance Department, i.e., a state regulatory agency. The court of appeals did not analyze whether the state action 
doctrine applied to that case and explained: [T]here is no apparent requirement to reconcile the filed rate and state action doctrines, as courts have generally applied 
them independently. See, e.g., Trigen-Okla. City Energy Corp. v. Okla. Gas & Elec. Co., 244 F.3d 1220, 1224-25 (10th 
Cir.2001) (dismissing claims under state action doctrine and as a result declining to reach filed rate doctrine); City of 
Kirkwood v. Union Elec. Co., 671 F.2d 1173, 1182 (8th Cir.1982) (independently analyzing the filed rate doctrine and the 
state action doctrine). Moreover, the doctrines do not completely overlap because the filed rate doctrine, unlike the state 
action doctrine, does not provide complete immunity from antitrust liability. See Essential Commc'ns, 610 F.2d at 1121. McCray, 682 F.3d at 238 n.6. Based upon the analysis in McCray, a court may apply the filed rate doctrine to federal antitrust 
claims arising from rates filed with a state regulatory agency without conducting an analysis of the state action doctrine. "
558,14," The court in Borough of Landsdale v. PP & L, Inc., recognized: Numerous courts have held that the filed rate doctrine applies equally to rates filed with state agencies. See Wegoland Ltd. 
v. NYNEX Corp., 27 F.3d 17, 20 (2d Cir.1994); Taffet v. Southern Co., 967 F.2d 1483, 1494 (11th Cir.1992) (holding that 
the filed rate [*72]  doctrine applies with equal force whether the rate at issue was set by a state or federal rate-making 
authority); H.J., Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 954 F.2d 485, 494 (8th Cir.1992) (""the rationale underlying the filed rate 
doctrine applies whether the rate in question is approved by a federal or state agency""). The filed rate doctrine can be a 
defense to both federal and state law actions based on the regulated rates. See Ark. La. Gas Co. v. Hall, 453 U.S. 571, 
578, 101 S.Ct. 2925, 69 L.Ed.2d 856 (1981) (finding that under the filed rate doctrine, ""courts lack authority to impose a 
different rate than the one approved by the Commission""). Borough of Lansdale v. PP L, Inc., 426 F. Supp. 2d 264, 282-83 (E.D. Pa. 2006)."
558,15," The Court rejected the argument that to avoid discriminatory rates all shippers injured may sue to recover based upon the 
difference in rates. Keogh, 260 U.S. at 164. The Court reasoned that it was ""highly improbable"" all courts and juries would 
provide each shipper ""the same measure of relief."" Id. "
560,16," In Arkansas Louisiana Gas Co. v. Hall, 453 U.S. 571, 101 S. Ct. 2925, 69 L. Ed. 2d 856 (1981), the court considered whether 
the filed rate doctrine ""for[bade] a state court to calculate damages in a breach-of-contract action based on an assumption that 
had a higher rate been filed, the [Federal Energy Regulatory] Commission [(""FERC"")] would have approved it."" Id. at 573. The 
plaintiffs in the trial court were the producers of natural gas, and the defendant was a customer who purchased the defendant's 
gas. Id. The parties entered into a contract for the sale of gas, which contained a favored nations clause. That clause provided 
that if the defendant purchased gas at a higher price from another seller, the plaintiffs were entitled to a higher price for their 
sales to the defendant. Id. at 573-74. The plaintiffs—as required by law—filed the contract and their rates with the FERC ""and 
obtained from...[the FERC] a certificate authorizing the sale of gas at the rates specified in the contract."" Id. at 574. At a later 
date, the defendant purchased gas from another seller at a higher rate than it agreed to in its contract with the plaintiffs and did 
not honor the favored nations clause in the contract. Id. The plaintiffs filed suit against the defendant seeking damages 
measured by ""an amount equal to the difference between the price they actually were paid in the intervening years and the price 
they would have been paid had the favored nations clause gone into effect."" Id. The Supreme Court in Arkla noted that during the pendency of the legal proceedings, the plaintiffs ""gained 'small producer' 
status,"" which meant they were no longer required to make rate increase filings. Arkla, 453 U.S. at 575 n.4. The Court ultimately 
held that ""the filed rate doctrine prohibits the award of damages for Arkla's breach during the period that respondents were 
subject to the...[FERC's] jurisdiction."" Id. at 584. The Court, in a footnote inserted at the end of that sentence, explained: ""There 
is no bar to damages for the period after respondents gained 'small producer status."" Id. at 585 n.14. Accordingly, Arkla supports 
the notion that rates that are not subject to the authority of a regulator are also not subject to the filed rate doctrine."
560,17," The Third Circuit Court of Appeals recognizes that there are two policies underlying the filed rate doctrine, which are referred 
to as the ""nondiscrimination strand"" and the ""nonjusticiability strand"" of the filed rate doctrine. In re N.J. Title Ins. Litig., 683 F.3d 
at 455-56. The court of appeals has not recognized the two policies as ""elements in determining whether to extend the [filed rate] doctrine 
to new areas[,]"" but has analyzed whether the facts of a given case implicate either of the policies to determine whether the filed 
rate doctrine applies to bar claims based upon properly filed rates. Id. at 456-60 (emphasis added); McCray, 682 F.3d at 241-42. The nondiscrimination strand is concerned with ""'preventing carriers from engaging in price discrimination as between 
ratepayers,'"" and ""recognizes that 'victorious plaintiffs would wind up paying less than non-suing ratepayers.'"" Id. (quoting 
Wegoland Ltd. v. NYNEX Corp., 27 F.3d 17, 21 (2d Cir. 1994)). The nondiscrimination strand is not implicated in this case 
because plaintiffs are suing defendants ""on their own behalf and on behalf of all others similarly situated."" (ECF No. 286 at 1); 
McCray, 682 F.3d at 242. It is, therefore, ""unlikely that a victory would allow [plaintiffs] to pay less than other ratepayers."" 
McCray, 682 F.3d at 242. "
561,18," At least one treatise calls into question the soundness of the decisions relaxing the requirement that rates be literally filed with 
the regulating agency. IA PHILLIP E. AREEDA & HERBERT HOVENKAMP, ANTITRUST LAW ¶ 247b (4th ed. 2013). This seems to be an unwarranted extension of a doctrine that even the Supreme Court concedes is justified only by 
precedent. As weak as Keogh's rationales for the filed rate doctrine were when they were first formulated, they are virtually 
nonexistent when the rate in question is not subject to filing at all and the firm has unrestrained power to set its own rates. Id."
561,19," Highmark did not submit to the court any evidence to show that section 3803(e) applied to HHIC at the relevant time and 
required it to file its small-group health insurance rates with the PID. "
562,20," Whether the PID had the authority to review and withhold its approval of the PPO applications is not in issue in this case and 
is an issue separate from whether the PID had the legal authority to regulate HHIC's rates. Another concern is that the record is 
not clear with respect to the import of the 25% cap on the health status factor, i.e., whether there existed a ""calculable rate"" 
based upon that limitation and the confidential agreement dated April 26, 2010. McCray, 682 F.3d at 240 (quoting Whitaker v. 
Frito-Lay, Inc., 88 F.3d 952, 961 (11th Cir. 1996)). Even if the filed rate doctrine might apply the court cannot, based upon the 
record presented, assess whether the PID's actions constituted rate-regulation upon which the court may not infringe. Courts 
have held that when it is unclear whether there is a properly filed rate, and, therefore, whether the pertinent regulating agency 
had jurisdiction over the complained-of rates, summary judgment should be denied. E. & J. Gallo Winery v. EnCana Corp., 503 
F.3d 1027, 1045 (9th Cir. 2007) (affirming the district court's denial of the defendant's motion for summary judgment with respect 
to some of the plaintiff's claims based upon the filed rate doctrine because material issues of fact existed about whether the 
rates about which the plaintiff complained were properly filed rates within the jurisdiction of the regulating agency, i.e., the 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission); Florida Mun. Power Agnecy v. Florida Power & Light Co., 64 F.3d 614 (11th Cir. 1995) 
(remanding the motion for summary judgment for the district court to make a factual determination about whether the 
complained-about rates were subject to the jurisdiction of the regulating agency and, thus, filed rates)."
562,21," Although not addressed by the parties, Highmark's arguments with respect to the filed rate doctrine could be unavailing for 
another reason, i.e., the undisputed evidence of record does not show that HHIC filed its small groups rates with the PID during 
the relevant timeframe. The filed rate doctrine ""derives from the more general public utility rule that once a rate is filed with a regulatory agency, the 
company is forbidden to charge a different rate."" IA PHILLIP E. AREEDA & HERBERT HOVENKAMP, ANTITRUST LAW ¶ 247 (4th ed. 
2013). A review of decisions discussing the requirement of a filed rate shows that a filed rate is a rate submitted to the regulating 
agency, which is made available for public view, i.e., the published rate. See e.g., Brizendine v. Cotter & Co., 4 F.3d 457, 460 
(7th Cir. 1993), vacated on other grounds, 511 U.S. 1103, 114 S. Ct. 2095, 128 L. Ed. 2d 658 (1994); Maislin Indus., Inc. v. 
Primary Steel, Inc., 497 U.S. 116, 126, 110 S. Ct. 2759, 111 L. Ed. 2d 94 (1990); Ark. La. Gas Co. v. Hall, 453 U.S. 571, 577, 
101 S. Ct. 2925, 69 L. Ed. 2d 856 (1981). Here, Highmark argues that in connection with its negotiations with the PID with respect to its PPO applications, ""the PID 
reviewed and approved HHIC's rate formulas for July 1, 2010 through June 30, 2011[,]"" and ""[t]he PID demanded extensive rate-
related information prior to approving HHIC's new small group products, and refused to approve HHIC's new small group 
products until it was satisfied with the rate formulas that HHIC planned to use to charge small group rates."" (ECF No. 460 at 17.) 
As discussed above, the applicability of the filed rate doctrine does not depend upon the extent of review conducted by the 
regulatory agency; rather, it is the filing of the rate that ""triggers"" the doctrine. McCray, 682 F.3d at 238-39 (""[T]he Supreme 
Court has never indicated that the filed rate doctrine requires a certain type of agency approval or level of regulatory review. 
Instead, the doctrine applies as long as the agency has in fact authorized the challenged rate.""). Highmark did not submit to the 
court any evidence to show that HHIC's rates to be charged from July 1, 2010, through June 30, 2011, were properly filed with 
the PID and published or were otherwise made available for public view. Highmark cannot rely upon the April 26, 2010 agreement as evidence that it filed its rates with the PID because the undisputed 
evidence of record shows that: (1) HHIC during the relevant timeframe was not statutorily required to file its rates with the PID; 
and (2) the April 26, 2010 agreement was confidential, i.e., not available for public view. Under those circumstances, it would be 
questionable whether the court could find as a matter of law that HHIC's rates for small group health insurance to be charged 
from July 1, 2010, through June 30, 2011, were filed rates, which may trigger the application of the filed rate doctrine. As discussed above, courts in specific circumstances have not required that a rate be literally filed with the regulating agency in 
order to invoke the filed rate doctrine. Specifically, courts have held that (1) if a regulating agency has the authority to regulate "
563,," rates, and (2) exercises its authority to regulate rates, the filed rate doctrine may apply to bar damages based upon those rates 
even if they were not technically filed with the regulating agency. See e.g., Wortman, 854 F.3d at 606 (discussing cases); Texas 
Commercial Energy, 413 F.3d at 509; Utilimax, 378 F.3d at 303; Borough of Lansdale, 426 F. Supp. 2d at 283. The parties agree that from July 1, 2010, through at least June 30, 2011, the PID did not have the statutory authority to regulate 
HHIC's small-group health insurance rates. Highmark argues that the PID regulated its rates via the April 26, 2010 agreement, 
but did not point to any authority to show that the PID had the authority to regulate those rates. There is evidence of record that if 
the PID received complaints about HHIC's rates, the PID had authority to investigate those rates. There is no evidence of record, 
however, that the PID exercised that authority with respect to the rates complained about in this case and actually investigated 
and regulated those rates. Those facts do not appear to satisfy the two-part test to determine whether rates that were not 
technically filed with a regulating agency trigger the application of the filed rate doctrine. Under those circumstances, the court 
would not be able to find as a matter of law that HHIC's rates were filed with the PID such that the filed rate doctrine applies to 
bar any claim for damages based upon rates charged by HHIC from July 1, 2010, through June 30, 2011. "

619,8, The individual third-party payors' operative complaint names only Wyeth and its affiliates as defendants. 
622,9," This conclusion renders unnecessary the need to address the Lipitor direct purchasers' argument that they should be granted 
leave to submit a new complaint with economic calculations to bolster their allegations of an unlawful reverse payment. "
624,10," Notably, Lipitor plaintiffs do not allege the size or value of Pfizer's grant to Ranbaxy of early access into several foreign 
markets for Lipitor."
624,11," As explained infra, not only does Lipitor defendants' request for detailed economic analyses go beyond what is required at this 
stage of the litigation, but that request also attempts to require Lipitor plaintiffs to disprove what Lipitor defendants must prove. 
Lipitor defendants suggest that the size of the reverse payment must be determined by the net reverse payment, which accounts 
for litigation costs and other discounting measures and justifications for the payment. In doing so, Lipitor defendants seem to 
conflate the Actavis requirement that the reverse payment be ""large"" with the requirement that the payment be ""unjustified."" 
Their proposed economic valuation demands that Lipitor plaintiffs disprove proffered justifications for the reverse payment 
settlement agreement. Lipitor plaintiffs, though, need not do so at the pleading stage. Actavis, 133 S. Ct. at 2236 (""An antitrust 
defendant may show in the antitrust proceeding that legitimate justifications are present, thereby explaining the presence of the 
challenged term and showing the lawfulness of that term under the rule of reason."" (emphasis added)). "
625,12," The Lipitor parties differ as to whether, under the Sherman Act, foreign or out-of-market procompetitive effects of the 
settlement agreement, like the Canadian supply arrangement and settlement of the Caduet litigation, can justify the domestic or 
in-market anticompetitive effects of the settlement, namely Ranbaxy's delayed entry into the U.S. Lipitor market. We need not 
decide that issue, as Lipitor plaintiffs have, at least at this point in the litigation, plausibly alleged the absence of justifications for 
the reverse payment. See King Drug Co., 791 F.3d at 410 n.34 (""It may also be (though we do not decide) that procompetitive 
effects in one market cannot justify anticompetitive effects in a separate market."" (citation and quotation marks omitted)). "
626,13," Because Effexor plaintiffs' complaints contain substantively identical factual allegations, we cite only to the direct purchasers' 
complaint, referring to their second amended complaint as ""DPP Sec. Am. Compl."" "
627,14," Reliability is often associated with the evidentiary standard applicable to expert testimony, see Rule 702(c) of the Federal 
Rules of Evidence, not the pleading standard required to survive a motion to dismiss. As the Amicus Brief submitted by the 
American Antitrust Institute points out, the District Court even seems to have suggested that Effexor plaintiffs at the pleading 
stage should have produced evidence in order to make their allegation plausible: ""Since the Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs fail to 
provide appropriate evidence for the Court to determine the value of the payment, the allegations in the Complaint do not reach 
the plausibility standard established in Iqbal and Twombly."" In re Effexor XR Antitrust Litig., 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 142206, 2014 
WL 4988410, at *23 (emphasis added); American Antitrust Institute Amicus Br. 10. "
628,15," The procedural history related to the royalty licensing provisions further supports our conclusion. The Effexor direct purchasers 
filed a motion for leave to file a second amended consolidated complaint on August 28, 2013, attaching their proposed 
complaint. A week after receiving this proposed second amended complaint, Effexor defendants sent Effexor plaintiffs a copy of "
629,," the unredacted agreement containing details about the royalties, coming mere days before oral argument on Effexor plaintiffs' 
request to amend. Despite the timing of its disclosure, Effexor defendants would have this panel affirm the dismissal of all the 
complaints, without giving any Effexor plaintiffs, even those other than the direct purchasers, a chance to amend. Given this 
procedural background, dismissal based on the absence of detailed, expert-derived allegations explaining the royalty licenses—
as requested by Effexor defendants—would be inappropriate. This procedural history serves to underscore the concern that 
requiring the heightened level of specificity requested here would make settlement agreements like this one nearly impossible to 
challenge because the details of the agreements are closely guarded by the parties entering into them. American Antitrust 
Institute Amicus Br. 6-7. Accordingly, it was appropriate to look to general assumptions about authorized generics to determine 
the value of the agreement based on the information available to Effexor plaintiffs. They need not have brought in experts to 
assess the settlement based on the limited information they had. "
630,16," Named after Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, 365 U.S. 127, 81 S. Ct. 523, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464 
(1961); United Mine Workers of Am. v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 85 S. Ct. 1585, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626 (1965). "
632,17," Because we reverse the dismissal of Lipitor plaintiffs' Walker Process fraud allegations, we will also reverse the District Court's 
limitation on Lipitor plaintiffs' potential damages period, Lipitor I, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 126468, 2013 WL 4780496, at *25, as 
that limitation was predicated on the dismissal of the Walker Process fraud allegations. "
633,18," The District Court also appeared to rely on the law of the case doctrine, citing case law applying that doctrine. The law of the 
case doctrine does not apply here because it only applies within a single litigation. See Hamilton v. Leavy, 322 F.3d 776, 786-87 
(3d Cir. 2003) (""The law of the case doctrine 'limits relitigation of an issue once it has been decided' in an earlier stage of the 
same litigation."" (quoting In re Cont'l Airlines, Inc., 279 F.3d 226, 232 (3d Cir. 2002))). "
634,19," Pfizer cites several cases, but none supports the District Court's functional application of collateral estoppel here. See, e.g., 
CBS Outdoor Inc. v. New Jersey Transit Corp., No. CIV.A.06-2428HAA, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 64155, 2007 WL 2509633, at *2, 
*15 (D.N.J. Aug. 30, 2007) (concluding that plaintiff's allegations were implausible, as that same plaintiff's allegations had been 
rejected in state court). "
636,20," For a similar reason, Pfizer's later disclosures of information in the foreign litigation fail to make Lipitor plaintiffs' allegations of 
fraudulent intent implausible. "
638,21," Pfizer also argues that its mere submission of data to the FDA in support of its petition renders implausible allegations that the 
petition was a sham. Reading the complaints in the light most favorable to Lipitor plaintiffs, a reasonable inference is that the 
data submitted with the petition only perpetuated Pfizer's baseless attempt to prevent Ranbaxy's entry into Lipitor's market. At 
the very least, the mere submission of data in support of a petition raises no inference that the petition itself possessed merit. 
Put simply, Pfizer's submission of data with its petition does not make Lipitor plaintiffs' sham petition allegations implausible. "

Without acknowledging the apparent discrepancy, Exhibit A indicates four Plaintiffs in this category. Because the identities of the 
four non-supplier Plaintiffs have been revealed in Exhibit A, Defendants' argument that dismissal is warranted because ""no one 
could identify"" the non-supplier Plaintiffs is now moot. (Doc. 16-1 at 15.) "
656,8," See Calderone Enters. Corp. v. United Artists Theatre Circuit, Inc., 454 F.2d 1292, 1295 (2d Cir. 1971) (holding that HN23[
] 
in order to have antitrust standing, ""a person must be within the 'target area' of the alleged antitrust conspiracy, i.e., a person 
against whom the conspiracy was aimed, such as a competitor of the persons sued""). Defendants argue that the Supreme Court 
""overruled the 'target area' test for standing in"" AGC, as did the Second Circuit in Crimpers Promotions Inc. v. Home Box Office, 
Inc., 724 F.2d 290 (2d Cir. 1983). (Doc. 23 at 9-10 & n.6.) They read these cases too broadly. In AGC, the Supreme Court 
discussed the ""target area"" test in a footnote without either approving or disapproving of it. See AGC, 459 U.S. at 536 n.33 
(noting that some courts ""have applied the requirement that the plaintiff must be in the 'target area' of the antitrust conspiracy""). 
In Crimpers, the Second Circuit did ""not hold that Calderone . . . ha[s] been drained of [its] precedential vitality on [its] own or 
very similar facts"" but instead held that ""courts of this circuit"" must ""follow the approaches adumbrated by the Supreme Court in 
McCready and [AGC.]"" 724 F.2d at 293. "

660,3," The Eichmann Report is attached as Exhibit 5 to Hearst's Compendium of Evidence in support of, among other things, Hearst's 
motion to exclude Eichmann's testimony. "
661,4," Sillers' own testimony regarding his ""analysis of costs"" does not support Eichmann's assumption. In his declaration Sillers 
described his analysis as ""an analysis of cost"" but stated that his analysis had nothing to do with the UPA. Plaintiff's Ex. 28 at 3-
4. In deposition Sillers explained that he parsed out the various expenses relevant to a print product per page and compared that 
to an average rate per page to ascertain the level at which the Chronicle would break even. Plaintiff's Ex. 29 at 86:3-7 (omitting 
the portion of the transcript containing the question), 86:15-24, 87:6-22, 88:1-9. This does not show Sillers was attempting to 
allocate the costs necessary to produce and sell the FRROP advertising product as distinct from the costs of producing and 
selling for example editorial content that is paid for by subscribers. Compare Pan Asia Venture Capital Corp. v. Hearst Corp., 74 
Cal. App. 4th 424, 426, 88 Cal. Rptr. 2d 118 (1999). There are many ways in which to calculate costs, and the UPA's method of 
fully allocated costs is only one of those. Turnbull & Turnbull v. ARA Transportation, Inc., 219 Cal. App. 3d 811, 820-21, 268 Cal. 
Rptr. 856 (1990)."
661,5," Eichmann himself calculated that the Chronicle consists of 75% editorial pages and 25% advertising pages. Hearst Ex. Mat 
98:10-15. "
662,6," Plaintiff offers some tangential evidence in an effort to support the challenged allocation decisions. See Plaintiff Ex. 126 at 
39:8-21 (print advertising priced to cover newsprint, ink, sales, salaries, and commissions and tried to maximize margin to cover 
the rest of the operations), Ex. 134 at 32:18-33:6 (in newspaper industry, the pricing of advertising is significantly tied to 
profitability). But there is no indication that Eichmann relied on this highly generalized evidence, which is not surprising because 
it does nothing to support Eichmann's calculations."
662,7, Hearst attaches the Rubinfeld Report as Exhibit 1 to the Declaration of Daniel L. Rubinfeld.
662,8," Compare, Taylor v. Trimble, No B276723     Cal.App.5th     2017 WL 3187388 at n.15 (July 27, 2017 ) (expert opinion that does 
not contain reasoned explanation illuminating why the facts have convinced the expert is not reliable), citing Jennings v. Palomar 
Pomerado Health Systems, Inc., 114 Cal.App.4th 1108, 1118, 8 Cal. Rptr. 3d 363 (2003)."
662,9, Opposition at 13 note 5.
662,10," Although not part of the Examiner's Separate Statement of Disputed Facts or responses to the Statement of Hearst, at 
argument the Examiner's counsel suggested that Eichmann may have relied on the opinion of Hopson, Tr. 12. This isn't so. But 
even had Eichmann so relied, there is nothing substantial to rely on. Hopson's opinion was that the ""burden"" of profitability is 
carried by advertising. Tr. 12:8-14, especially at line 14. While this mimics the word ""burden"" from case law (e.g. Pan Asia 
Venture Capital Corp. v. Hearst Corp., 74 Cal. App. 4th 424, 431, 88 Cal. Rptr. 2d 118 (1999), quoting Turnbull & Turnbull v. 
ARA Transportation, Inc., 219 Cal.App.3d 811, 822, 268 Cal. Rptr. 856), it doesn't support Eichmann's allocation of 100% of the 
Chronicle's costs such as ink and paper to advertising, or otherwise support Eichmann's use of the Sillers document and its 
categories. The truth is that Eichmann simply didn't account for the fact that the Chronicle has substantial subscription income 
which obviously contributes to the Chronicle's 'profitability'—he just 'puts that to the side.' Tr. 79-80. "

665,19," See Smith v. Virginia Commonwealth Univ., 84 F.3d 672. 676 14th Cir. 19961 (regression ""must include all the major factors"") 
(emphasis in original); Griffin v. Board of Regents, 795 F.2d 1281, 1290 n. 16 (7th Cir.1986) (same); Bickerstaff v. Vassar 
College, 196 F.3d 435, 449 (2d Cir.1999) (regression analysis not admissible because major variable omitted); In re Processed 
Egg Prod. Antitrust Litig., 81 F.Supp.3d 412, 430-31 (E.D. Pa. 2015) (holding that expert opinion was admissible because the 
defendants did not identify an omitted factor that rendered the expert's analysis unreliable); Crawford v. Newport News Industrial 
Corp., 2017 WL 3222547. at *5 (E.D. Va. July 28, 2017) (failing to account for ""job classifications"" in an analysis of salaries 
rendered regression analysis inadmissible because ""job classifications"" was a major factor); In re Wireless Tel. Servs. Antitrust 
Litig., 385 F.Supp.2d 403, 428 (S.D.N.Y. 2005) (where defendants pointed to two major developments that could explain why the 
average wholesale price for wireless handsets exceeded those for comparable consumer electronic products and/or their 
component parts — the shift from analog to digital technology and the related advances in handset features — the plaintiff's 
""failure to test for these obvious and significant alternative explanations"" rendered its analysis ""essentially worthless"" and 
inadmissible). "
666,20," This position is very odd. The point of a multiple regression analysis is to sort through a series of possible explanations for a 
value (here, loss of Examiner's ad sales), testing whether one of them (here, presumably the downward pricing of the 
Chronicle's ads) correlates, holding fixed the other explanatory variables. But noting only correlated downward pricing (as 
between the Chronicle and the Examiner) without testing against other obvious explanations (such as industry-wide decrease in 
ad revenues) just begs the question of the reason for the Examiner's losses."
666,21," Some cases suggest that a party objecting to a regression analysis on the basis of a major omitted variable should run an 
analysis demonstrating that including the variable makes a difference. E.g., In re Live Concert Antitrust Litig., 863 F. Supp. 2d 
966, 974 C.D. Cal. 2012) (""There must be some indication that the excluded variables would have impacted the results""); Palmer 
v. Shultz, 815 F.2d 84, 101, 259 U.S. App. D.C. 246 (D.C. Cir. 1987). Hearst does not run its own regression analysis with the 
omitted explanatory variables, but it did use Plaintiff's specifications but using Chronicle's quantity. instead of the Examiner's 
quantity, as the dependent variable. Supplemental Rubinfeld Report ¶ 13. If Eichmann is using the right model, and if he's right 
that there is a two player market, then his formulas should produce sensible results for both the Examiner and the Chronicle. But 
they don't: they implies the patently bizarre conclusion that Chronicle's price increases lead to an increase in demand for its 
product. Id. "
667,22," These were not the IVs used in Eichmann's original analysis, which used an improper data set. Hearst accuses Eichmann of 
selecting IVs to rig the results based on his decision to change the IVs. Motion, 20. At deposition, Eichmann explained that 
certain IVs no longer had explanatory power with the complete data set, but the new IVs did have explanatory power. Hearst's 
Ex. M at 314:4-19. The Examiner does not otherwise explain the switch in IVs. "
668,23," At deposition, Eichmann described the process through which he selected IVs. Hearst's Ex. M at 310:13-314:19. He does not 
describe a consideration of whether the IVs were exogenous or endogenous variables. Instead, he suggests he chose the Ws by 
plugging potential Ws into an unspecified test, id., that he never describes nor for which he states a source. The test may not 
really exist. Rubinfeld Suppl. Decl. at ¶ 33."
668,24," Hearst notes that Eichmann cited one source for the revised IVs: Rubinfeld's concededly authoritative textbook. Motion at 
20:9-10. Rubinfeld explains that Eichmann misread the book. Rubinfeld Supp. Decl. ¶14. "
669,25," E.g., CDW LLC v. NETech Corp., 906 F.Supp.2d 815, 824 (S.D. hid. 2012) (yardstick is only acceptably reliable under 
Daubert if the yardsticks are sufficiently comparable that they may be used as accurate predictors of what the target would have 
done); Loeffel Steel Prod, Inc. v. Delta Brands, Inc., 387 F.Supp.2d 794, 812-17 (N.D. III. 2005) (refusing to permit expert 
testimony based on companies that were not properly comparable); Washington v. Kellwood Co., 105 F.Supp.3d 293,314-18 
(S.D.N.Y. 2015) (distinguishing cases in which there is no evidence to support the yardstick comparison from cases where there 
is some evidence to support the yardstick comparison, the weight of which is measured by jury)."
669,26," I reject the Examiner's suggestion that it is Hearst's burden to produce an alternative yardstick. It may well be that there is no 
suitable yardstick, in which case the yardstick approach is not suitable. William B. Rubenstein, NEWBERG ON CLASS ACTIONS § 
20:61 (5th ed., as of June 2017 update) (""For instance, the yardstick method can be a highly effective method of calculating the 
amount of damage caused by a price-fixing cartel, but only if there exists a closely analogous market that was not cartelized 
during the period in question. If data on such a market is not available, the plaintiff will have to utilize a different methodology"")."
669,27," Plaintiff also understood that Klein intended to offer an opinion on a fourth topic. In opposition, Hearst states that the fourth 
topic raised by Plaintiff's motion is not at issue. Accordingly, Klein may not provide testimony on that fourth topic. "
670,28," Plaintiff criticizes Klein for his failure to consider specific pieces of financial information. Motion, 12-14. But Plaintiff has not 
established that Klein could not, as an expert in his field, rely on the information that he did rely on, or that he is required to 
consider the information identified by Plaintiff."
670,29," In the course of providing other opinions, Klein may assume that the Transcon sum is a 'contract termination payment,' if there 
is admissible evidence to support that assumption. "
671,30, The Rubinfeld Report is attached as Exhibit 93 to the Omnibus Declaration of Jeffrey A. Atteberry.

proving unlawful purpose would most likely come through circumstantial evidence. One method of establishing circumstantial 
evidence would include looking at the defendant's past conduct and demonstrating a significant shift in pricing practice while 
showing a significant erosion in revenue or profits. A second method would be showing an overall purpose of harming the 
plaintiff through evidence of other targeted conduct towards the plaintiff in conjunction with a below-cost pricing scheme. A third 
method would be proving that the defendant was focused on plaintiff's pricing scheme and not of others in the same market"") 
The Examiner does not offer this sort of evidence. "
681,53," While the order of burden shifting differs, that does not impact the ultimate result."
681,54," Compare Plaintiff's Response to Separate Statement re Interrogatory 32 (Defendant's Ex. 26) (no additional customer specific 
facts re loss leader contentions). "
683,55," Plaintiff's citation to dicta in an appellate decision that was subsequently superseded by a decision of the California Supreme 
Court does not carry weight. Motion, 16 (citing People v. Pay Less Drugstore, 143 P.2d 762, 769 (Cal. Ct. App. 1943), affirmed 
by People v. Pay Less Drugstore, 25 Cal.2d 108, 153 P.2d 9 (1944)."
683,56," Hearst also argues, and offers undisputed evidence, that print advertising and digital advertising are at times sold in bundles. 
Opposition, 13-14 (citing evidence). Hearst argues that in such instances, the bundle is the product. Id. at 13. If this argument is 
correct, then the meeting competition defense is of no moment as to bundled packages, because the product in this case is 
FRROP print advertising. "
684,57," This does not necessarily preclude Hearst from using evidence of the rise of digital advertising as background for an industry-
wide decrease in print advertising prices, with which Hearst was attempting to keep pace."
684,58," In any event, Hearst's evidence in support of its defense is not specific as to whether the competitor is advertising via print or 
digital media. Thus deciding this legal dispute is not essential to the resolution of this motion. "
685,59," Hearst also points to Plaintiff's evidence of a sale made by the Chronicle at $3,000 per page as an effort to meet the 
Examiner's prices for the same customer, which were lower. Opposition, 10-11; Plaintiff's Exs. 36, 86-87. In the absence of 
evidence indicating that Hearst had knowledge of the Examiner's price at the time of the sale, this evidence does not support 
Hearst's assertion that the sale in question was priced in an effort to meet the Examiner's competition. Compare Bergin Decl. ¶ 
14 (stating that the Chronicle understood that it ""generally"" charged the highest print newspaper advertising prices in the Bay 
Area). Similarly, Hearst points to an internal document indicating that Hearst made a particular advertising sale at a price point 
that was chosen because the Chronicle was negotiating the Examiner and needed to win the business. Plaintiff's Ex. 21. But, 
again, this does not indicate what the Examiner's price was, including whether Hearst was aware of the Examiner's offered price 
and/or if Hearst sold advertising below the Examiner's offered price."
685,60," The truth of this general point is disputed. But, drawing all inferences in favor of Hearst, Hearst has established, for present 
purposes, that it sold its FRROP advertising for the highest price it could obtain in negotiations with individual advertisers. "

698,24," Winter, ante note 3, at 16. To give a brief sketch of this debate, some experts like the late Clyde Summers argued for broad 
labor powers and exemptions from antitrust laws. Summers contended that ""[u]nions, in bargaining, are not private organizations 
but are governmental agencies garbed with the cloak of legal authority to represent all employees in the unit and armed with the 
legal right to participate in all the decisions affecting terms and conditions of employment."" Clyde Summers, Union Powers and 
Workers' Rights, 49 MICH. L. REV. 805, 811 (1951). Other authorities asserted that the monopolistic status of unions undermines 
the freedom of workers' individual rights to contract and compete. They argued for narrow labor powers. See, e.g., FRIEDRICH A. 
HAYEK, THE CONSTITUTION OF LIBERTY 267 (1960) (""[W]e have now reached a state where [unions] have become uniquely 
privileged institutions to which the general rules of law do not apply.""). For purposes of this opinion, we merely note that the 
dispute between our antitrust and labor policies has been fiercely contested for generations. See generally CLYDE W. SUMMERS & 
HARRY H. WELLINGTON, LABOR LAW Chap. 1 (1968)."
698,25," One observer even suggested that ""regulation of union activity under the Sherman Act [by the federal judiciary] undermined 
judicial prestige in the minds of the American public and labeled the Sherman Act as a weapon of class war that would be an

the Basis of Antitrust Suit Against Union Which Coerces Its Acceptance, 61 CORNELL L. REV. 436, 437 (1976). At the very least, 
we can say with certainty that this debate extended well beyond the ivory tower. See, e.g., W.L. White, Should Unions Have 
Monopoly Power?, READER'S DIGEST (Aug. 1955)."
698,26," Chief Justice Taft captured this labor ambition in his famous statement: [Labor unions] were organized out of the necessity of the situation. A single employee was helpless in dealing with an 
employer. He was dependent ordinarily on his daily wage for the maintenance of himself and family. If the employer refused 
to pay him the wages that he thought fair, he was nevertheless unable to leave the employ and to resist arbitrary and unfair 
treatment. Union was essential to give laborers an opportunity to deal in equality with their employer. Am. Steel Foundries v. Tri-City Central Trades Council, 257 U.S. 184, 209, 42 S. Ct. 72, 66 L. Ed. 189 (1921)."

Inc., 385 F.3d 894, 897 (6th Cir. 2004). At the hearing on May 3, 2017, the Court asked Counsel for SFX to brief the issue of whether the bankruptcy trustee is the real 
party in interest. On May 10, 2017, SFX filed a Supplemental Brief and attached the Bankruptcy Plan and the Litigation Trust 
Agreement. (Doc # 24) Defendants did not file a response. These documents indicate that the Litigation Trustee is aware of this 
lawsuit, and that this lawsuit was specifically excluded from the definition of ""Litigation Trust Claim."" Accordingly, the Court is 
satisfied that SFX is the real party in interest. "
802,2, See Mich. Admin. R. 436.1041; M.C.L. § 436.1909. 
807,1," SFX, and not the bankruptcy trustee, filed the Complaint in this action. In the bankruptcy setting, a debtor has an affirmative 
duty to disclose all of his assets to the bankruptcy court. Stephenson v. Malloy, 700 F.3d 265, 267 n.2 (6th Cir. 2012) (citing 11 
U.S.C. § 521(a)(1)). A cause of action is an asset that must be scheduled under § 521(a)(1). See Eubanks v. CBSK Fin. Grp., 
Inc., 385 F.3d 894, 897 (6th Cir. 2004). At the hearing on May 3, 2017, the Court asked Counsel for SFX to brief the issue of whether the bankruptcy trustee is the real

817,2, See Mich. Admin. R. 436.1041; M.C.L. § 436.1909. 
829,1," The FMMOs are issued by the USDA pursuant to section 8c(5) of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937 (""AMAA"")."
829,2," Notably, while Plaintiffs' current claims against Defendants are based entirely on the allegedly improper inclusion of ""forward 
pricing,"" Plaintiffs acknowledge that the CDFA, by contrast, permitted the inclusion of forward pricing for the relevant time period. "
830,3," The Court granted Plaintiffs' request to file this witness' name under seal. Doc. No. 379. All parties understand who the Court is 
referring to here. "
832,4," Plaintiffs note that the Proposed Defendants cannot be added as defendants with respect to claims involving 
misrepresentations to the USDA, based on this Court's previous ruling on the applicable statutes of limitations barring such an 
attempt by Plaintiffs. See Doc. No. 240."
832,5," Changes from the TAC are noted in italics. In the FAC, Plaintiffs dropped their violation of RICO COAs and pled only amended 
COAs for conspiracy to violate RICO. "
834,6," California Dairies cites to a statement by Plaintiffs that they did a ""rushed review"" of the documents from DairyAmerica in order 
to try to move to amend prior to the deadline. Doc. No. 238. This statement does not reflect a representation from Plaintiffs that 
they actually completed reviewing all documents produced in this case by June 2014. "
835,7," Defined as the time when ""Defendants have filed an answer to the [FAC] or, alternatively, the Court enters an order denying 
leave to file a [FAC]."" Doc. No. 368."
835,8, The Court notes that these cases cited by Plaintiff were decided under Rule 15 and not Rule 16. 
837,9, The Court's ruling has no bearing on the California plaintiffs' ability to file a separate case. 
839,10," Since the delayed discovery rule applies, the Court need not address whether the doctrine of fraudulent concealment applies 
in this case. See In re Toyota Motor Corp. Unintended Acceleration Mktg., Sales Practices, Prod. Liab. Litig., 2010 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 142652, 2010 WL 6419562, at *7 (C.D. Cal. Dec. 9, 2010) (""Because the Court finds that the applicability of the discovery 
rule prevents dismissal of Chang's claims on statute of limitations grounds at this stage, the Court need not address her 
alternative argument that the statute of limitations should be equitably tolled due to fraudulent concealment."") "
844,11," Further, even if the Court did find fault with Plaintiffs' original pleading, the Ninth Circuit has made it clear that the imposition of 
costs under Rule 15 is purely discretionary. Gen. Signal Corp., 66 F.3d at 1514. "
845,12, Nothing in this Court's order prohibits the California plaintiffs from filing these claims as a separate case. 
849,1," In addition to the direct and indirect purchaser plaintiffs, there is also a third group of plaintiffs involved in this MDL. This third 
group has been referred to as the Homebuilder Plaintiffs. The Homebuilder Plaintiffs filed suit approximately two years after the 
case began, and are not seeking to proceed as a class. "
850,2," Plaintiffs seek certification for the following states: Arizona, California, Illinois, Florida, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, 
Missouri, New York, Utah, and Wisconsin. ECF 473, IPP Mot. p. 3."
850,3," At oral argument, IPPs clarified that their definition of end-user does not include purchasers of completed homes that contain 
drywall. Tr. 16:18-19. "
851,4," Defendants do not challenge typicality or adequacy as to the named plaintiffs representing New York, Utah, or Michigan. "
855,5," With respect to the state of the ascertainability requirement in the Third Circuit, it is relevant to note that Judge Rendell wrote a 
concurrence in Byrd, in which she advocated a retreat from the ""administratively feasible"" requirement. Id. at 172 (Rendell, J., 
concurring). Judge Rendell commented that the ""lengths to which the majority goes in its attempt to clarify what our requirement 
of ascertainability means"" shows that the Third Circuit's ""heightened ascertainability requirement defies clarification"" and unfairly 
narrows the availability of class actions by ""requiring that plaintiffs conjure up all the ways that they might find the evidence 
sufficient to approve someone as a class member."" Id. at 172, 174. The Second Circuit recently agreed with Judge Rendell's 
reasoning, declining to adopt the Third Circuit's ""heightened"" ascertainability requirement. In re Petrobas Sec. Litig., 862 F.3d 
250 (2d Cir. 2017)."
855,6," In City Select, Judge Fuentes reprised Judge Rendell's Byrd concurrence, by writing separately to voice his endorsement of a 
retreat from the heightened ascertainability requirement "
868,1," A roustabout is a ""laborer esp. in an oil field or refinery."" Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary (10th ed. 2001). In the 
present context, the term should not be confused with its secondary definition of a ""circus worker,"" id., which appears to have 
given the 1964 Elvis Presley vehicle Roustabout its title and plot. "
873,2," Defendants argue in the alternative that, even if the Court were to apply the narrow economic loss rule as advocated by 
Plaintiffs, it would nonetheless apply because there actually is a contract here—the FERC tariff that governed the transportation 
of oil. See Reply 4:2-13; DSUF ¶¶ 14-15. The Ninth Circuit has in the past characterized FERC tariffs in contractual terms. See 
California ex rel. Lockyer v. Dynergy, Inc., 375 F.3d 831, 841 (9th Cir. 2004), amended on denial of reh'g, 387 F.3d 966 (9th Cir. 
2004) (""The [FERC] tariff defines the companies' contractual obligation with respect to the conduct at issue.""). However, 
because the Court determines that the economic loss rule applies regardless of any contractual obligation, the sufficiency of the 
tariff for this purpose need not be considered. "
874,3," It is also worth noting that the Blue Water Boating decision was on a motion for dismissal, not summary judgment. The Court 
did not conclude that a special relationship existed as a matter of law, but only that ""Blue Water [had] asserted sufficient facts"" to 
draw that inference at the pleading stage. Id. "
875,4," Additionally, several of the decisions cited by Defendants actually did consider other J'Aire factors when the first was not 
satisfied, even though emphasis was placed on the first factor. See, e.g., Ott, 31 Cal. App. 4th at 1456 (also considering the 
second factor); Zamora, 55 Cal. App. 4th at 212 (also considering the third factor)."
875,5," Plaintiffs dispute this assertion on the ground that ""[w]hile the class representatives were employed by contractors to the 
operators, the class also includes employees of the operators themselves."" PSGD ¶ 19. However, the Court has not yet certified 
an oil industry subclass. This motion for partial summary judgment is limited to the named Oil Industry Plaintiffs."
875,6," Defendants would dispose of the first factor on this fact alone. See Mot. 13:6-8. However, this Court ruled in Venoco that a duty 
of care can still exist even when plaintiffs are not mentioned in the FERC tariff. See Venoco Inc. v. Plains Pipeline, L.P. et al., CV 
16-2988 PSG (JEMx), Dkt. # 71, at 9 (""Even if Defendants correctly assert that Venoco is not a 'shipper' under the Local Tariff 
and so cannot claim the benefit of the Local Tariff, Defendants still owe duties to foreseeable plaintiffs under state and federal 
law."") (citation omitted). "
878,7," Defendants point out that there is some temporal distance between their conduct and the alleged injuries. Mot. 16:24-26. For 
example, although the spill occurred on May 19, 2015, Plaintiff Wilson was not laid off until November 24, 2015, see DSUF ¶ 55, 
while Plaintiff Guelker was not laid off until January 12, 2016, see id. ¶ 36. The Court, however, agrees with Plaintiffs that 
Defendants ""make[] far too much of the time lapse between the Pipeline shutdown and Plaintiffs' injuries."" Opp. 20:3-4. The 
lapse is attributable to factors such as Exxon's belief that the shutdown would end soon, see PSGD ¶ 139; Nelson Decl. 24, and 
Freeport's decision to lay off contractors but not employees. See PSGD ¶ 137; Nelson Decl. Ex. 20. Although some time did 
pass, and other actors exercised their own judgments, neither of these factors are sufficient to attenuate the causal chain to the 
extent of a case like Benefiel. "
881,8," In addition to an underlying legal violation, there are two other prongs on which a UCL claim can be premised. UCL prohibits 
""any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or practice."" Carter v. Bank of Am., N.A., No. CV 12-06424 MMM (FFMx), 2012 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 196351, 2012 WL 12887542, at *9 (C.D. Cal. Dec. 12, 2012) (emphasis added). Because the UCL is ""written in 
the disjunctive, it establishes three varieties of unfair competition—acts or practices which are unlawful, or unfair, or fraudulent."" 
Cel-Tech Commc'ns, 20 Cal. 4th at 180. Plaintiffs raised ""fraudulent"" and ""unfair"" claims in their Second Amended Complaint. 
SAC, ¶¶ 299-300. However, the Oil Industry Plaintiffs did not address these potential avenues for UCL relief in their opposition, 
and so the Court considers these arguments conceded. See Ramirez v. Ghilotti Bros. Inc., 941 F. Supp. 2d 1197, 1210 (N.D. 
Cal. 2013) (deeming argument conceded where plaintiff failed to address it in opposition). Furthermore, any additional claims 
brought under UCL by the Oil Industry Plaintiffs would also fail due to a lack of Article III standing. "
882,9," Plaintiffs argue that they do in fact have standing because a ""private person may recover for a public nuisance if the person 
suffers special injury."" Opp. 25:6-10 (citing Cal. Civ. Code § 3493; Venuto v. Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp., 22 Cal. App. 3d 
116, 124, 99 Cal. Rptr. 350 (1971)). They then point to the fact that a California court has held that an outdoor adventure 
company suffered special injury as a result of the 2015 spill because ""profitable commercial activities were prevented by the oil 
discharge's interference with access to these public spaces."" Santa Barbara Adventure Co. Inc. v. Plains All American Pipeline, 
L.P., No. 17-CV-00551 (Santa Barbara Cty. Super. Ct. May 1, 2017). However, as Defendants correctly note, Plaintiffs confuse 
the special injury requirement for public nuisance with Article III sanding. See Reply 12:21-23. Although both are required for 
standing in a public nuisance suit, the presence of an alleged special injury does not determine the injury's redressability or 
automatically confer Article III standing. "
885,1," On June 12, 2017, Constellation NewEnergy, Inc. was substituted as a party for Constellation Energy Services of New York, 
Inc. (d/b/a/ Integrys Energy). (Doc. 243.) The Clerk of Court is directed to amend the caption accordingly. In 2014 Constellation 
purchased Integrys Energy Services of New York, Inc. (""Integrys""). (TAC ¶ 60.) The Court will refer to both Integrys and 
Constellation as Constellation throughout this opinion."
885,2, Duthie is also a practicing attorney. (TAC ¶ 8.) 
886,3," New York General Municipal Law § 103 bars municipalities from contracting for ""services through the county in which [it] is 
located or through any county within the state when bids and offers have been received . . . , unless such purchase may be 
made or the contract for such services may be entered into upon the same terms, conditions and specifications at a lower price 
through the county."" N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law § 103(3)."
886,4," Direct Energy is an ESCO formerly doing business as Hess Energy Marketing, LLC (""Hess""). (TAC ¶¶ 19, 56.) The Court will 
refer to both Direct Energy and Hess as Direct Energy. Direct Energy is not a named defendant in this suit but is included in a 
section of the TAC entitled ""Non-Parties Who Plaintiffs Intend to Add as Defendants."" (Id. ¶ 19.)"
886,5," Plaintiffs mention ""Nat-Grid Upstate,"" (see, e.g., TAC ¶¶ 39, 70), ""Nat Grid Upstate,"" (see, e.g., id. ¶¶ 115, 163), ""Nat Grid,"" 
(see, e.g., id. ¶¶ 151, 162), ""National Grid,"" (see, e.g., id. ¶¶ 62, 189), ""National Grid New York,"" (see, e.g., id. ¶ 88), and 
""National Grid Upstate,"" (see, e.g., id. ¶ 77). The Court assumes that these varying iterations all refer to the same utility area and 
will refer to this utility territory as Nat Grid throughout."
886,6," ""NYSEG"" is an acronym for the New York State Electric & Gas Corporation. See Avangrid, Inc., Annual Report at 4 (Form 10-
K) (Mar. 10, 2017)."
886,7," ""RG&E"" is an acronym for the Rochester Gas and Electric Corporation. See id."
886,8," The TAC refers to this group of utility areas as the ""Upstate Energy Market,"" (TAC ¶ 39), but Plaintiffs did not provide 
information on how many utility areas there are, what communities they cover, or where precisely they are located. Plaintiffs 
assert based on minutes from meetings held in 2011 and early 2012 that some unspecified Defendants were selling electricity "
887,," and natural gas to over 240 municipal energy consumers in the Upstate Energy Market, (id. ¶ 72), but because the total number 
of consumers is not provided it is difficult to put this figure into perspective."
887,9," ""O&R"" is an acronym for the Orange and Rockland Utilities, Inc. See Company Information, Orange & Rockland, 
https://www.oru.com/en/about-us/company-information (last visited Aug. 25, 2017)."
887,10," The only example the TAC provides is Dutchess County's announcement that it had saved $129,000 by rejecting MEGA's 
proposal and would bid out its next energy contract without MEGA. (TAC ¶ 84.)"
887,11," ""Antitrust Defendants"" refers to MEGA, EnergyNext, Boyd, M&R, Cobuzzi, Constellation, Spaeth, and Hills."
887,12," The TAC has two paragraphs numbered 194. (See TAC at 59-60.) I will refer to the first paragraph 194 as 194.1 and the 
second paragraph 194 as 194.2."
887,13," The TAC has two paragraphs numbered 195 and 196. (See TAC at 59-60.) I will refer to the first paragraph 195 and 196 as 
195.1 and 196.1 and the second paragraphs as 195.2 and 196.2. "
889,14," ""Former Town Defendants"" refers to the Town; the Town Board; Town Supervisor Christopher St. Lawrence; Town 
Councilpersons Brendel Charles, Yitzchok Ullman and Patrick Withers; and Town officials Mona Montal, Michael L. Klein, Beth 
Finkelstein, Michael Reilly and Nathan Oberman. (Doc. 100.) "
890,15," Plaintiffs allege that in this and previous bids through MEGA, Constellation routinely submitted atypical pricing terms — for 
example, bids for time frames longer or shorter than those set forth in the specifications — in addition to the actual terms 
requested. (Id. ¶ 120.) "
892,16," The TAC does not allege that MEGA used bribery, threats or other criminal means to induce municipalities to do business 
through MEGA. The closest it comes is an allegation that ""there is . . . reason to believe that MEGA's 2014 [Town of] Ramapo 
piggy back benefited private residences of Town employees."" (TAC ¶ 65.) The ""reason to believe"" is apparently that Montal 
asked Schiller whether he could obtain municipal rates for ""various residences within the Town,"" (id. ¶ 198), that Duthie told the 
Town that ConEd would provide municipal rates to private individuals, (id. ¶ 199), and that in May 2014 Cobuzzi told Montal, 
when Montal said that an earlier energy supplier had provided an ""extension"" for Town employees, that they could ""briefly 
discuss a residential program,"" (id. ¶ 254). Given that ConEd never supplied the Town, through MEGA or otherwise, and that the 
alleged conversation involving Duthie did not refer to the residences of Town employees, let alone Town employees involved in 
the bidding process, that conversation does not plausibly suggest that municipal rates were provided to Town employees to 
corrupt the process. Further, although Cobuzzi's company, M&R, did supply the Town via the 2014 piggyback, there is no 
suggestion that Montal's inquiry regarding Town employees went anywhere, nor are there any facts rendering it plausible that 
her request was for a bribe in connection with the gas bids, as opposed to an innocent effort to see if a benefit for all Town 
employees was possible. "
893,17," Plaintiffs brought suit for: 1) First Amendment retaliation under 42 U.S.C. § 1983; 2) violation of the Fourteenth Amendment 
Due Process Clause under § 1983; 3) Monell liability under § 1983; 4) conspiracy under § 1983; 5) breach of contract; 6) tortious 
interference with business and contractual relationships; 7) injury to business reputation; 8) injurious falsehood; 9) prima facie 
tort; 10) commercial disparagement and defamation; and 11) tortious interference with prospective business relations and 
economic advantage. (Doc. 4.)"
893,18," In the AC Plaintiffs brought suit for: 1) violation of the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause (liberty interest) under § 
1983; 2) violation of the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause (property interest) under § 1983; 3) First Amendment 
retaliation under § 1983; 4) civil RICO under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c); 5) civil RICO conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d); 6) Monell 
liability under § 1983; 7) conspiracy under § 1983; 8) breach of contract; 9) tortious interference with business and contractual 
relationships; 10) injury to business reputation; 11) injurious falsehood; 12) commercial disparagement and defamation; 13) 
tortious interference with prospective business relations and economic advantage; and 14) deceptive practices under New York 
General Business Law § 349. (Doc. 22.)"
893,19," The SAC alleged the same claims as the AC as well as a claim for First Amendment Retaliation under § 1983 and a claim for 
violation of § 1 of the Sherman Act and §§ 4 and 16 of the Clayton Act. (Doc. 51.)"
893,20," The TAC asserts claims for 1) conspiracy under § 1983; 2) civil RICO under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c); 3) tortious interference with 
business and contractual relationships; 4) deceptive practices under N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law § 349; 5) § 1 Sherman Act — 
unreasonable restraint of trade; 6) § 2 Sherman Act — Monopolization; 7) § 2 Sherman Act - Attempted Monopolization; 8) § 2 
Sherman Act — Conspiracy to Monopolize; and 9) violation of the New York Donnelly Act. (Doc. 154 ¶¶ 300-401.) The claims 
under § 2 of the Sherman Act for monopolization, attempted monopolization, and conspiracy to monopolize were new to the 
TAC. Plaintiffs have withdrawn the § 1962(c) civil RICO conspiracy claim (Count Two). (See Doc. 189.) "
894,21," ""ESCO Defendants"" refers to M&R, Cobuzzi, Constellation, Spaeth and Hills."
894,22," ""ConEd's Mem."" refers to ConEd's, O'Gara's and Wemple's Memorandum of Law in Support of their Motion to Dismiss, (Doc. 
232); ""Duthie's Mem."" refers to Daniel Duthie's Memorandum of Law in Support of his Motion to Dismiss, (Doc. 202); ""ESCOs' 
Mem."" refers to M&R's, Cobuzzi's, Constellation's, Spaeth's, and Hills's Memorandum of Law in Support of their Motions to "
895,," Dismiss, (Doc. 223); ""MEGA's Mem."" refers to MEGA's Memorandum of Law in Support of its Motion to Dismiss, (Doc. 216 Ex. 
1); and ""EnergyNext's Mem."" refers to EnergyNext's and Boyd's Memorandum of Law in Support of their Motion to Dismiss, 
(Doc. 228). "
896,23," ""Ps' Mem."" refers to Plaintiffs' Memorandum of Law in Opposition to MEGA, EnergyNext, M&R, and Constellation's Motions to 
Dismiss, (Doc. 236.)"
896,24," Plaintiffs, MEGA, EnergyNext, and Duthie are not the only energy consultants serving municipalities. (See TAC ¶¶ 48, 81, 106, 
179.)"
896,25," Plaintiffs' allegation of predatory pricing is odd given that at certain points in the TAC they assert that Plaintiffs' ESCOs were 
the lowest bidders, (see, e.g., TAC ¶¶ 270, 271, 276), which is inconsistent with the concept of ""predatory pricing[, which] occurs 
when a firm sets prices below its marginal costs thereby taking losses in the short run. The predatory firm hopes that similar 
losses will be experienced by its competitors prompting them to exit the industry. The ultimate goal of the predatory firm is to "
897,," recoup its losses by raising prices after competition is diminished."" Volmar Distribs., Inc. v. N.Y. Post Co., 825 F. Supp. 1153, 
1160 (S.D.N.Y. 1993)."
897,26," A subcontractor is ""[s]omeone who is awarded a portion of an existing contract by a contractor, esp[ecially] a general 
contractor."" Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014). "
899,27," Having decided that Plaintiffs have failed to state an antitrust injury, I need not address whether Plaintiffs meet the ""efficient 
enforcer"" requirement, although I tend to concur with Defendants, (see, e.g., ESCOs' Mem. at 21-24; MEGA's Mem. at 14; 
EnergyNext's Mem. at 9-10), that they do not. I also need not and do not reach the issues of whether Plaintiffs' allegations make 
economic sense or otherwise state plausible antitrust claims. (See, e.g., ESCOs' Mem. at 21-24.)"
899,28," In any event, Plaintiffs do not plausibly allege a protected property right in their continued status as the Town's exclusive 
energy consultant following the expiration of the two-year initial period in October 2013, or any legal obligation on the Town's 
part in 2014 to piggyback on REG's contract with Rockland County. See Gizzo v. Ben-Habib, 44 F. Supp. 3d 374, 385 (S.D.N.Y. 
2014) (commercial contract with state actor does not give rise to entitlement protected as property interest under due process 
clause) (collecting cases); Fletcher v. City of New Haven, No. 11-CV-708, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 42003, 2012 WL 1032967, at 
*2 (D. Conn. Mar. 27, 2012) (simple breach of contract by state actor does not amount to deprivation of property right) (collecting 
cases). Nor do Plaintiffs allege a plausible ""stigma-plus"" claim for deprivation of a liberty interest. Such a claim requires, among 
other things, that a statement impugning the plaintiff's reputation or integrity be made publicly, see Segal v. City of N.Y., 459 
F.3d 207, 212 (2d Cir. 2006), and while Plaintiffs allege in conclusory fashion that ""[t]he former Ramapo Defendants made 
numerous public comments about Plaintiffs that . . . were stigmatizing and defamatory,"" (TAC ¶ 307), they do not in that 
connection refer to any such statements, and the Court was unable to locate them in the TAC. (Klein's comment that ""he had a 
proposal from Con Ed Solutions that contained hidden and undisclosed fees for Schiller"" was allegedly made in closed session 
of the Town Board. (Id. ¶ 235.)) Further, the TAC contains no facts from which it could be plausibly inferred that any Defendant 
shared the Town's alleged desire to smear Plaintiffs publicly, and thus it does not allege the meeting of the minds necessary for 
a conspiracy claim. Finally, ""the availability of an adequate, reasonably prompt, post-termination name-clearing hearing is 
sufficient to defeat a stigma-plus claim,"" Segal, 459 F.3d at 214, and the TAC does not allege that Plaintiffs were deprived of 
process in the form of such a hearing, see Anemone v. Metro. Transp. Auth., 629 F.3d 97, 121 (2d Cir. 2011) (availability of 
Article 78 proceeding provides requisite post-deprivation process for alleged stigma-plus deprivation of liberty, even if plaintiff 
fails to pursue it). "
900,29," One problem with Plaintiffs' theory is that the scheme to deprive REG of its contract and give it to Duthie seems to be alleged 
to have begun in the fall of 2012, before Schiller's complaints began. Indeed, the complaints were about that alleged scheme. 
On the other hand, Town officials are alleged to have directly discouraged Plaintiff from speaking publicly about the issue. In 
January 2013, Finkelstein told Schiller that the Board would exclude him by going into executive session if he tried to speak 
publicly at a meeting, (TAC ¶ 212), and Klein told him that making complaints or filing grievances would only make matters 
worse, (id. ¶ 220). In November 2013, Schiller was asked not to speak in a public portion of a Town Board meeting but was 
heard privately. (Id. ¶¶ 233-34.) "
901,30," Further, it would stretch the law beyond reason if, as Plaintiffs at least imply, a business must walk away from an opportunity 
merely because a competitor says that a customer for whom they are both competing has bad intent."
901,31," In their opposition Plaintiffs mention that they have not yet been provided any discovery. (See, e.g., Ps' Mem. at 40 (""Because 
Plaintiffs have not been provided any discovery, Plaintiffs do not have knowledge of all of the communications between and 
amongst the defendants.""). This fact does not help Plaintiffs at this stage because under Iqbal, ""a plausible claim must come 
before discovery, not the other way around."" Angiulo v. Cty. of Westchester, No. 11-CV-7832, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 153656, 
2012 WL 5278523, at *3 n.4 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 25, 2012) (emphasis in original). "
909,1," Plaintiffs have adopted a litigation strategy attributing their exclusion to the fifteen percent requirement—presumably reducing 
the number of similarly-situated persons to those who had obtained a mathematical possibility of victory in the electoral college.

electoral college], you need one of two things: a lot of organization or a lot of money. . . . [The cost] varies by state, but if we look 
at the upper end of that [price] range, we're talking about a $5.5 million investment to get on the ballot in all 50 states.""). Of 
course, counsel's particular litigation strategy—the way they choose to characterize the effect of the alleged injury—hardly 
controls our analysis on this point. "
915,1," The plaintiffs' motion to compel was originally filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. It 
was transferred to this Court on July 26, 2017. (Docket Entry dated July 26, 2017, In re Namenda Direct Purchaser Antitrust 
Litigation, No. 17 MC 274 (S.D.N.Y.)). Lupin Pharmaceuticals' motion to quash was originally filed in the United States District 
Court for the District of Columbia, and was transferred to this Court on August 18, 2017 (Docket Entry dated Aug. 18, 2017, In re 
Namenda Direct Purchaser Antitrust Litigation, No. 17 MC 314 (S.D.N.Y.)). I heard oral argument on both motions on August 28, 
2017. "
916,2," The entity that actually filed the ANDA was Lupin Pharmaceuticals' parent company, Lupin Limited. (Transcript of Oral 
Argument dated Aug. 28, 2017 (""Tr."") at 17). "
917,3," Lupin Pharmaceuticals identifies another category of documents purportedly sought by the plaintiffs: documents sufficient to 
show ""the status of [active pharmaceutical ingredient (""API"")] manufacturing in preparation for launch"" (Non-Party Lupin 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc.'s Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel Production of 
Documents (""Lupin MTC Memo."") at 6, 10; Email of Daniel Simons dated July 21, 2017, attached as Exh. B to Jaramillo 8/2/17 
Decl.). Although the plaintiffs do not specifically list this category in their opening brief, such documents appear to be 
encompassed within the categories the plaintiffs seek. "
918,4," ""'At risk' entry refers to circumstances in which a generic has received final approval from the FDA to market its product but the 
infringement litigation is continuing and therefore the generic may be 'at risk' of incurring infringement damages if it enters the 
market but loses the patent litigation."" (First Amended Class Action Complaint (""Compl.""), ¶ 9 n.7). "
922,5," In limiting this claim, the opinion cites page 40 of the plaintiffs' opposition to Forest's motion to dismiss. 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
128349, [WL] at *16. That page, in turn, cites the paragraphs of the operative complaint comprising Count 2. ([Corrected*] Direct 
Purchaser Plaintiffs' Memorandum in Opposition to Defendants Forest and Merz's Motion to Dismiss Indirect Purchaser 
Plaintiffs' Class Action Complaint and Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs' First Amended Class Action Complaint at 40 (citing Compl., ¶¶ 
244-250), ECF No. 69)."
922,6," Lupin Pharmaceuticals also objects to the second, third, and fourth topics to the extent that they seek testimony about a 
counterfactual world in which the alleged anticompetitive conduct alleged in the complaint did not occur, arguing that such "
923,," hypotheses must come from an expert witness rather than a lay witness. (Lupin MTQ Memo. at 9). But those topics, as written, 
""merely require Lupin to testify about [its] own forecasts, projections, and expectations regarding its generic memantine product."" 
(Def. MTQ Memo. at 13)."
923,7," Lupin Pharmaceuticals' argument that Topic 6 is particularly objectionable because ""the settlement agreement expressly sets 
forth its purpose and effect"" and because testimony about the settlement agreement would likely call for information protected by 
attorney-client privilege or work product immunity (Lupin MTQ Memo. at 13; Lupin MTQ Reply at 4) fails. See Universitas 
Education, LLC v. Nova Group, Inc., No. 11 Civ. 1590, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1720, 2013 WL 57892, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 4, 
2013) (denying motion to quash based on ""preemptive assertion"" of privilege because ""unadorned assertion that 'other 
questions [counsel] may ask may very well be protected from discovery by the attorney-client privilege'"" does not satisfy 
standard for assertion of privilege under Rule 45); DR Systems, Inc. v. Eastman Kodak Co., No. 08 MC 6029, 2009 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 31535, 2009 WL 1009839, at *3 (W.D.N.Y. April 14, 2009) (requiring non-party to produce witness to testify about 
documents produced because ""[d]ocuments do not speak for themselves"")."
923,8," To the extent that Forest is concerned about admissibility, I urge it to continue to confer with Lupin Pharmaceuticals to resolve 
this issue and thereby further limit the topics upon which the company need be deposed. (O'Shaugnessy June 22, Email (noting 
that Lupin Pharmaceuticals has proposed ""a declaration in conjunction with an agreement that a Lupin witness would testify at 
trial to provide admissible evidence""). "
929,1," It is not clear why the stations are described as ""central"" or ""remote."" The court assumes that ""central"" stations are so named 
because they are centralized monitoring facilities that receive signals from all over the country, while ""remote"" stations are 
remote from these centralized facilities. But both are located offsite from the commercial or multifamily building itself."
929,2," The Village purportedly passed the ordinance for safety reasons; there is no indication that NWCDS or Tyco were involved in 
its passage."
929,3," In 2012, Schaumburg passed an ordinance requiring that fire alarm systems transmit their signals wirelessly, as opposed to 
using phone lines. (Compl. ¶¶ 57, 63.) "
930,4," The court assumes that locating the monitoring facilities offsite ensures that the monitoring continues to function in the event of 
a fire at the Commercial Account."
930,5," So far as the court can tell, these standards are called ""NFPA 72"" simply because NFPA has historically issued fire protection 
standards and codes in numerical order by subject. NFPA 10, for example, sets forth the ""Standard for Portable Fire 
Extinguishers."" List of NFPA Codes & Standards, NAT'L FIRE PROT. ASS'N, http://www.nfpa.org/codes-and-standards/all-codes-
and-standards/list-of-codes-and-standards (last visited Aug. 24, 2017)."
930,6," Because remote supervising stations are operated by government entities, Commercial Accounts that transmit to a remote 
supervising station must transmit to the one operated by their jurisdiction. Accordingly, while there can be multiple central 
stations serving one area, only one remote supervising station is usually available to a Commercial Account."
930,7," The parties have provided only brief excerpts of NFPA 72, which do not include these cited sections. The court therefore cites 
to related litigation describing these provisions."
930,8," Tyco has attached to its surreply a news article concerning the failure of thousands of transceivers installed in Plaintiff ADS's 
customers in fall 2016, after the Ordinance was passed. (Rodney Bosch, Alarm Detection Systems Recovering From 
Catastrophic Network Failure, SECURITYSALES.COM, Nov. 17, 2016, Ex. D to Tyco Surreply in Opp. to Pls.' Mot. for TRO and 
Prelim. Inj. [46-1].) "
931,9," NWCDS signed the agreement with ADT Security Services, which Plaintiffs contends is ""now known as Tyco[.]"" (Compl. ¶ 15.) 
The parties do not explain when or why the name change occurred, but Tyco does not dispute Plaintiffs' implicit characterization 
of ADT as Tyco's predecessor. Accordingly, the court refers to ADT as Tyco throughout this opinion."
931,10," This agreement apparently replaced a 2001 agreement between NWCDS and a predecessor to ADT Security Services and 
Tyco. (Compl. ¶ 65 n.5.)"
931,11," NFPA 72 also allows for a third option: proprietary supervising stations, in which property owners own and maintain their own 
supervising stations (NFPA 72 § 3.3.282.2 (2016 ed.), Ex. D to Compl.); this type of supervising station is not at issue in this 
case."
931,12," Plaintiffs contend that NFPA 72 ""recognizes central stations as the preferred monitoring service[.]"" (Compl.¶ 21.) But the 
section of NFPA 72 that they cite does not support this proposition, nor can the court find any such support in the provided 
NFPA 72 excerpt. (See NFPA 72 § 3.3.282.3 (2016 ed.), Ex. D to Compl. [1-1] (cited by Compl. ¶ 21).) "
932,13," The NWCDS/Tyco Agreement states that Tyco will charge Commercial Accounts just $22 per month (in addition to a $150 
connection fee). (NWCDS/Tyco Agreement § 6.1.) Plaintiffs do not explain how it is that Tyco is nevertheless able to charge $81 
per month. ""administrative fee"" that Tyco pays to NWCDS, the court can find nothing in the record showing whether or how any 
of this fee is passed on to Schaumburg. "
934,14," The court did express general concerns that the ordinance would have anticompetitive effects, but those comments are dicta. 
See Lisle-Woodridge II, 724 F.3d at 865 (""Excluding alarm companies from the monitoring business or making it unduly 
burdensome for them to participate raises significant concerns about the anti-competitive effects of this requirement[.]""); Lisle-
Woodridge I, 672 F.3d at 499 (""[T]hose powers [of a Fire Protection District] are not so broad as to enable the District to 
establish a monopoly over alarm transmitters and monitoring services[.]""); 503-04 (""acknowledg[ing] [the] possibility"" that the 
ordinance may create a monopoly). "
935,15, This exhibit was provided to the court at oral argument but has not been electronically filed.
935,16," As of this writing, the court has held a bench trial, but not yet ruled. The citations in this opinion are from the Orland court's 
rulings on defendants' motions to dismiss and the parties' cross motions for summary judgment. "
936,17," After the court granted in part the defendants' first motion to dismiss, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint, which the 
defendants again moved to dismiss. The court referred extensively to its ruling on the superseded pleading, and noted that for 
some issues ""neither Tyco nor Orland . . . have made any new arguments requiring the Court to reconsider its decision."" Orland 
II, 194 F. Supp. 3d at 710-11. This court cites to that earlier ruling as well."
936,18," Though the non-exclusivity was the basis for the court's decision, as noted above, the court is uncertain whether individual 
subscribers within participating ""Member Departments"" were required to contract with Tyco. "
937,19, Lisle-Woodridge and Orland concerned whether fire protection districts have the same power.
937,20," In Orland, the court found that the state-action immunity doctrine to the federal antitrust laws did not apply because ""Alarm 
Detection has made no claims under Illinois's antitrust laws."" Orland I, 129 F. Supp. 3d at 639. State-action immunity can also 
apply under federal antitrust laws, however. "
939,21," Defendants also cite to Justice v. Town of Cicero, 577 F.3d 768, 775 (7th Cir. 2009) in support of their argument. There, the 
court found the defendant town had state-action immunity for its control over the town's water department under 50 ILCS 35/1, 
not 65 ILCS 5/1-1-10. But section 5/1-1-10 contemplates anticompetitiveness over a more limited set of local government 
powers than section 35/1, so section 5/1-1-10 presents a stronger case for immunity than section 35/1."
939,22," Because this is a preliminary injunction, the court need not decide whether the Village is in fact entitled to state-action 
immunity. Instead, the court need only determine that the Village is likely entitled to the immunity."
939,23," Plaintiffs also cite to North Carolina State Board of Dental Examiners v. F.T.C., 135 S. Ct. 1101, 1110, 191 L. Ed. 2d 35 
(2015), but in that case, both parties assumed, as did the court, that the state had clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed 
a policy with anticompetitive effects. That case is therefore not instructive. "
940,24," Even if NWCDS or Tyco had urged the passing of the Ordinance, the court remains uncertain that could be a basis for liability. 
See E. R. R. Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 135, 81 S. Ct. 523, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464 (1961) (""[N]o 
violation of the [Sherman] Act can be predicated upon mere attempts to influence the passage or enforcement of laws."")."
940,25," NWCDS also argues that it is entitled to state-action immunity, but the court is less certain. 65 ILCS 5/1-1-10 applies only to 
municipalities, and although 50 ILCS 35/1 applies to all ""local governments,"" the court noted above that section 35/1 expresses 
a policy of delegating antitrust immunity in a much broader set of circumstances, essentially whenever a traditional local 
government activity is authorized by law. With such a broad expectation of anticompetitiveness, it is more difficult to say that any 
anticompetitiveness in fire protection stems from a ""clearly articulated"" policy, rather than a policy that is so general it is not 
clearly articulated. But the court need not reach the issue at this stage."
940,26," The court therefore declines to address the merits of the antitrust claims, or to conduct the fact-intensive analysis required to 
examine the likelihood of success on the merits of these antitrust claims. The result of such an analysis is not clear-cut. For "
941,," example, the parties dispute the definition of the relevant geographic market, a critical question in an analysis of monopolization 
claims. 
See 
U.S. 
Dep't

Justice

Comm'n, 
Horizontal 
Merger 
Guidelines 
(2010), https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/atr/legacy/2010/08/19/hmg-2010.pdf , at § 4.2. Plaintiffs point out that Commercial 
Accounts in Schaumburg have no alternative to using Tyco's equipment. Thus, they conclude, Schaumburg is the relevant 
market. Defendants concede that ""the area in which consumers can practically turn for alternative sources of the product"" is 
important to this determination. (Tyco Surreply 5 (quoting F.T.C. v. OSF Healthcare Sys., 852 F. Supp. 2d 1069, 1076 (N.D. Ill. 
2012)).) But they also cite their expert report in the Orland case, in which their expert claims that in the Orland district, the prices 
Tyco charges are no higher than in territories where it does not have exclusivity, suggesting that the entire Chicago area is the 
relevant market. (Rep. of John Durkin, Ph.D. at 7, 24-25, 31, Alarm Detection Sys. v. Orland Fire Protection Dist., No. 14 CV 
876, Ex. B to Tyco Surreply [46-1].) This position appears to conflict with their position in Lisle-Woodridge, where ADT (Tyco's 
predecessor) asserted in the verified complaint, which it made along with several Plaintiffs in this case, that the relevant 
geographic market in that case was limited to the Lisle-Woodridge fire protection district, not the greater Chicago area. (Supp. 
Verified Compl. at ¶¶ 7, 91-92, ADT Sec. Servs. v. Lisle-Woodridge Fire Protection Dist., No. 10 CV 4382 (N.D. Ill. Jul. 14, 
2010), Ex. GG to Transcript; see also Ex. HH to Transcript.) "
942,27," Contrary to the Plaintiffs' claim, the Seventh Circuit did not ""flatly reject"" the District's safety and faster response time 
justification for the ordinance in Lisle-Woodridge. In fact, the court upheld that ordinance's provision for a remote supervising 
station. The court rejected the ordinance's requirement that customers get their equipment directly from the district, but that 
rejection was based on the fact that the district did not have the power to impose such a mandate; it did not address the district's 
justification for the ordinance. Lisle-Woodridge I, 672 F.3d at 502-03."
942,28, Transcript 7:8. 
943,29," Plaintiffs do point out that NFPA 72 requires that property owners who use a remote supervising station be responsible for 
activities ""related"" to signal transmission, such as ""equipment installation, inspection, testing, and maintenance,"" (NFPA 72 § 
3.3.282.3 (2016 ed.), Ex. D to Compl), but Plaintiffs do not explain how the Village's system violates this provision."
943,30," Plaintiffs do not claim that central station monitoring results in more effective monitoring, and do not address the evidence that 
ADS itself suffered an outage in fall 2016. See Bosch, supra note 8. "
944,31," Plaintiffs also cite a 2001 letter from the Illinois attorney general ""specifically address[ing]"" the right to operate a licensed 
business. This letter merely addresses the existence of the right, which Defendants do not dispute (Ex. C to Pls.' Mem. [9]); it 
does not address the justification for this Ordinance or whether the Ordinance is arbitrary or unreasonable. "
945,32," The Village also argues that Plaintiffs should have identified specific third parties with whom it has contracts or prospective 
contracts. See Schuler, 265 Ill. App. 3d at 994, 639 N.E.2d at 147. The court does not agree that Plaintiffs are required to 
identify hundreds of customers at this stage. Defendants do not seriously dispute that Plaintiffs have these existing contractual 
relations. And Plaintiffs have in fact identified two customers who stated that they were declining to renew their contracts 
specifically because of the Ordinance."
945,33," The Orland court decided this issue on different grounds. There, the court found that the Du-Comm/Tyco Agreement was not 
exclusive, and dismissed the due process and equal protection claims on that basis. "
950,1," See Chi. Nat'l League Ball Club, Inc. v. Skybox on Waveland, et al., No. 02 C 9105, United States District Court for the 
Northern District of Illinois. "
951,2," The Cubs first acquired ""Down the Line,"" a rooftop business located at 3621 N. Sheffield. In total, six rooftop businesses 
changed hands: three to the Cubs and three to unrelated investors. In conjunction with their Rule 59(e) motion, the Rooftops 
provided documentation showing that the holding companies that acquired six of the rooftop properties were owned by 
Greystone, LLC, which in turn was owned by Northside Entertainment Holdings, LLC. Northside, of which Ricketts serves as the 
executive vice president, owns and operates the Chicago Cubs. "
954,3," Having determined that the antitrust claims were properly dismissed, we will forego an analysis of the Rooftops' relevant market 
and distribution arguments."
954,4," Although the Rooftops' complaint seeks relief for an anticipatory breach of contract, we will analyze this claim as a breach of 
contract, as the district court did, because the video board has been constructed. "
956,5," Ricketts' remarks also formed the basis of the Rooftops' claims under the Lanham Act, the Uniform Deceptive Trade Practice 
Act, and the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act, as well as claims for defamation and false light. The 
Rooftops do not challenge the dismissal of these claims, and thus we limit our discussion to the breach of the non-
disparagement provision of the License Agreement. "
961,1," Qualcomm has sued the Contract Manufacturers in a related action for breach of their license agreements. Qualcomm Inc. v. 
Compal Electronics Inc. et al., 3:17-cv-01010-GPC-MDD (complaint filed May 17, 2017). The two cases were consolidated at the 
Court's August 18, 2017 hearing. Dkt. No. 118. "
962,2," See 
ETSI, 
ETSI 
Intellectual 
Property 
Rights 
Policy, 
Annex 
6, 
(April 
5, 
2017), http://www.etsi.org/website/document/legal/etsi_ipr-policy.pdf . Apple cites to the IPR Policy in its complaint. See, e.g., FAC ¶ 
45, Dkt. No. 83 at 22. Qualcomm, in its answer, ""refers [the Court] to ETSI's Intellectual Property Rights (""IPR"") Policy for its 
contents."" Answer to FAC ¶ 45, Dkt. No. 97 at 10. Given Qualcomm's referral, the Court finds it appropriate to take judicial notice 
of the provisions included in the IPR policy. "
963,3," Apple's January 20, 2017 complaint asserted twenty-five (25) causes of action against Qualcomm. Dkt. No. 1. Of those causes 
of action, eighteen (18) were patent challenges directed at nine separate patents owned by Qualcomm. Additional challenges 
launched at another nine patents, along with added invalidity claims as to the nine patents already asserted in the original 
complaint, account for thirty-six (36) of the extra causes of action in the FAC. Thus, besides for the supplemental patent claims, 
the only other new causes of action raised by Apple in the FAC concern Claim LX (60), the request for declaratory relief on the 
STA and Claim LXI (61), the request for declaratory relief for Qualcomm's license agreements with the Contract Manufacturers. "
964,4," Apple filed a single complaint in the U.K. on January 23, 2017. Harrison Decl. ¶ 2 , Dkt. No. 108-3 at 2. It filed four complaints 
in Japan on February 16, 2017, Yakura Decl. ¶¶ 3, 15, Dkt. No. 108-6 at 2, 5. Thereafter, Apple filed five complaints in China. 
Yang Decl. ¶ 5, Dkt. No. 108-8 at 2. Finally, on April 11, 2017, Apple filed a complaint against Qualcomm in Taiwan. Wang Decl. 
¶ 2, Dkt. No. 108-4 at 2. Although the Yang declaration does not include the precise date that the five Chinese actions were 
filed, Qualcomm has not objected to Apple's representation that all lawsuits were filed before April 11, 2017. "
968,5," The Court observes that Apple's complaint does not ask for a worldwide FRAND determination. That relief is found only in 
Qualcomm's counterclaim. Notwithstanding this fact, Qualcomm argues that Apple's complaint nevertheless places the parties' 
global FRAND dispute in issue because the parties' failed licensing negotiations precipitated the current dispute. Accordingly 
and because Apple's complaint has placed the global FRAND dispute in issue, Qualcomm avers that this Court should resolve "
969,," the global FRAND issues between Apple and Qualcomm. Dkt. No. 92-1 at 20. At oral argument, it became apparent that Apple's 
position is that this Court does not have the authority to adjudicate Qualcomm's counterclaim for a global FRAND determination 
because Apple is under no obligation to accept Qualcomm's license offer regardless of whether the offer is FRAND and because 
Apple has not consented to be bound by any global FRAND determination. Transcript, Dkt. No. 122 at 41-47. As such, Apple 
argues that any decision by this Court setting a global FRAND rate would be an advisory opinion. See generally Microsoft Corp. 
v. Motorola, Inc., 795 F.3d 1024, 1039 n.13 (9th Cir. 2015); TCL Commc'ns Tech. Holdings Ltd. v. Telefonaktenbologet LM 
Ericsson, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 197559, 2014 WL 12588293, *5 (C.D. Cal. Sept. 30, 2014); Realtek Semiconductor Corp. v. LSI 
Corp., 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 146565, 2012 WL 4845628, *5 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 10, 2012). The Court, however, need not decide this 
question to resolve the instant motion. Regardless of whether or not Qualcomm's counterclaim is proper, the anti-suit injunction 
fails."
969,6," The Court observes that Apple is a member of ETSI. Qualcomm, however, has made no argument that through its 
membership, Apple has somehow agreed to circumscribe or limit how it may seek to enforce other members' obligations to 
ETSI."
969,7," Of course, if Apple wishes to enforce Qualcomm's commitment to ETSI it must demonstrate that it was a willing licensee and, 
therefore, a proper third-party beneficiary. The nature of that obligation, however, is different in kind than Qualcomm's obligation 
to ETSI. If Apple is not a willing licensee, it simply loses the right to enforce Qualcomm's contract with ETSI. Yet if Qualcomm 
fails to offer a FRAND license, it has breached its contractual obligations. "
970,8," The Court again observes that Apple disputes that it would be bound by any global FRAND determination made by this Court 
because it does not have to accept a license from Qualcomm. "
971,9," The Court observes that it is telling that the two factors that Qualcomm has identified as applicable are the two factors deemed 
less important elsewhere. See, e.g., Ibeto Petrochemical Indus. Ltd. v. M/T Beffen, 475 F.3d 56, 64 (2d Cir. 2007) (concluding 
that the first and third Unterweser factors hold greater significance than the second and fourth). "
972,10," In its 2016 decision, the Korea Fair Trade Commission (""KFTC"") found that this practice violated Qualcomm's FRAND 
commitment to ETSI. See infra Part D. "
975,11," The following decisions were specifically identified in Apple's first amended complaint. See FAC ¶¶ 200-06. In its answer, 
Qualcomm acknowledges the existence of each of these cases, but refers the Court ""to the foregoing documents for their 
contents."" Answer to FAC ¶¶ 200-06. Thus, the Court finds it proper to take judicial notice of the contents of these decisions and 
the official documents explaining the grounds for the decisions."

989,*," Honorable Barbara Jacobs Rothstein, United States District Judge for the Western District of Washington, sitting by 
designation. "
990,1," Reviewing a dismissal for failure to state a claim, we accept the factual allegations as true and draw all reasonable inferences 
in favor of the claimant. Spanish Broad. Sys. of Fla., Inc. v. Clear Channel Commc'ns, Inc., 376 F.3d 1065, 1070 (11th Cir. 
2004). The facts as pleaded in the complaints, and viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, are as follows."
990,2, The New Jersey complaints do not allege State Farm's control of that state's private passenger automobile insurance market.
990,3," The Missouri body shop participated in State Farm's DRP for ten years; State Farm eliminated the shop from the program in 
2013 after the shop refused to implement the company's parts procurement program. "
991,4," In addition to using the market labor rate, the other insurance companies have specifically advised the body shops that the 
companies ""will pay no more than State Farm pays for labor."""
991,5," The body shops attached as an exhibit to each complaint a ""non-exhaustive list of procedures and processes the [d]efendants 
refuse to pay and/or pay in full."" "
992,6," The New Jersey body shops allege that the GEICO companies in particular delay supplemental payments and delay re-
inspecting vehicles. After finally inspecting a vehicle, a GEICO inspector would refuse to pay a body shop because the bill is ""too 
old."" If the insured also refuses to pay the bill, the body shop must absorb the unpaid cost."
992,7," ""Generally, an order dismissing a complaint is not final and appealable unless the order holds that it dismisses the entire action 
or that the complaint cannot be saved by amendment. . . . However, [in this circuit] the plaintiff need not wait until the time for 
amendment expires; he can waive the right to later amend, treat the dismissal as final, and file a notice of appeal before the 
expiration of the amendment period."" Van Poyck v. Singletary, 11 F.3d 146, 148 (11th Cir. 1994) (per curiam). "
995,8," Notwithstanding our disagreement with the district court's analysis, we would like to recognize the tremendous effort that the 
district court expended in handling a multidistrict litigation of this scale. "
996,9," Also, the Dissent disputes both plus factors by emphasizing the absence from the complaints of a statement in the body shops' 
brief: that the insurance companies used identical ""scripts"" to steer insureds away from noncompliant shops. See Dissent at 24-
25. Also, the Dissent emphasizes that ""the body shops' [brief] takes undue liberties in construing the allegations that can be fairly 
read from their pleadings."" Dissent at 1 n.1. The absence from the complaints of the allegation about ""scripts"" and other 
""constructions"" of the allegations is inapposite to the soundness of the allegations that are present in the complaint. "
998,10, The Missouri complaint contains no claim for quantum meruit. 
999,11," As stated above, the allegations about GEICO appear only in the New Jersey complaints. "
1000,1," At the outset, I pause to address two issues regarding the complaints. The first is merely an observation of the time-worn 
principle that it is only the factual allegations contained therein which we must accept as true. In my opinion, the body shops' 
appellate briefing takes undue liberties in construing the allegations that can be fairly read from their pleadings. The district court 
dismissed these claims without prejudice and, therefore, the body shops had an opportunity to amend their complaints to include 
any additional allegations that may have been omitted from their initial pleadings. Having chosen not to do so, they are not 
permitted to simply ""insert"" new allegations through their appellate briefing. These gaps—between the allegations of the 
complaints and the allegations of the appellate briefing—are discussed, where relevant, below. Secondly, I note that this appeal is a consolidation of five cases and, therefore, there are five complaints in the record. 
References in this opinion to the ""complaints"" can be considered a collective reference to all of them. References to a 
""complaint"" and citations to ""Compl. at ¶ X"" are to the complaint in the New Jersey case filed by Quality Auto Painting Center of 
Roselle, Inc., which is, in relevant part, representative of the other four complaints. "
1001,2," The instant appeal represents only a portion of more than twenty such cases filed on behalf of body shops around the country 
and consolidated in the Middle District of Florida. Notwithstanding this Court's disagreement with its resolution of the present 
issues, I agree with the majority in expressing my gratitude to the district court for its efficient and thorough handling of this 
extraordinarily complex litigation."
1001,3," Of course, an antitrust plaintiff can also offer direct evidence of an agreement or evidence of parallel conduct that is contrary to 
the defendants' self-interest. The body shops have not done so here and are, accordingly, left with an attempt at adducing 
evidence of relevant plus factors."
1001,4," The body shops argued on appeal that their complaints established at least five plus factors. The majority has relied only on 
those it identified in its opinion and, therefore, I do not address the body shops' additional plus factors in any depth. It bears 
mentioning, however, that I consider them to be wholly without merit. "
1002,5," In considering each plus factor, I am cognizant of the Supreme Court's admonition that antitrust plaintiffs receive ""the full 
benefit of their proof without tightly compartmentalizing the various factual components and wiping the slate clean after scrutiny 
of each."" Cont'l Ore Co. v. Union Carbide & Carbon Corp., 370 U.S. 690, 699, 82 S. Ct. 1404, 1410, 8 L. Ed. 2d 777 (1962). At 
the same time, it is undoubtedly our responsibility ""to evaluate the evidence proffered by the plaintiffs not to ascertain its 
credibility, but instead to determine whether that evidence, if credited, 'tends to' establish a conspiracy more than it indicates 
conscious parallelism."" Williamson Oil Co., Inc. v. Philip Morris USA, 346 F.3d 1287, 1301 (11th Cir. 2003). "
1003,6," The majority (Maj. Op. at 22-23) fails to recognize that the allegation—that the insurance companies told the body shops that 
they would pay no more than State Farm—gives rise to no inference of prior agreement; to the contrary, it is a straightforward 
assertion of following the price leader. "
1004,7," As for what else can be said about that allegation, the fact that the body shops concede that some of the alleged actions 
occurred ""independently"" is certainly noteworthy. How the majority was able to discern which of the allegedly nefarious activities 
were conducted ""in concert""—a Sherman Act concern—and which were conducted ""individually""—a decidedly non-Sherman Act 
concern—is left unspoken. "
1005,8," Although I do not consider this failure to be dispositive, treating it as such would not be outlandish. At a bare minimum, we 
should expect antitrust plaintiffs to state their belief that an agreement was reached before we go off in search of plus factors to 
support an inference of its existence. "
1006,9," It is worth noting in my example—as in the instant case—the body shops have not alleged that the complained-of tactics are 
""identical."""
1006,10," The body shops use, and the majority endorses, a similar pleading trick with respect to the ""non-exhaustive list of procedures 
and processes the [d]efendants refuse to pay and/or pay in full."" Maj. Op. at 8 n.5 (alteration in original)."
1006,11," Even if the insurance companies were alleged to have used similar or identical reasons as to why their insureds should not 
use a particular body shop, the reasons suggested—that the body shop charges more or takes longer or does poor quality 
work—would seem to be obvious reasons an insurance company would not want its insureds to use that body shop. That is, 
such similarity would seem to be independent responses to common stimuli. "
1007,12," See infra note 28 (suggesting my concern that the majority may have implicitly relied on the insurance companies' market 
power, leading it to dilute the requirement that there must be—in addition to consciously parallel conduct—a plus factor giving 
rise to a plausible inference of an agreement or conspiracy)."
1007,13," See Jones v. Sparks, 297 S.W.3d 73, 78 (Ky. Ct. App. 2009) (""For a party to prevail under the theory of unjust enrichment, 
they must prove three elements: (1) benefit conferred upon defendant at plaintiff's expense; (2) a resulting appreciation of 
benefit by defendant; and (3) inequitable retention of benefit without payment for its value.""); Binkley v. Am. Equity Mortg., Inc., 
447 S.W.3d 194, 199 (Mo. 2014) (""An unjust enrichment claim requires a showing that: (1) the plaintiff conferred a benefit on the 
defendant; (2) the defendant appreciated the benefit; and (3) the defendant accepted and retained the benefit under inequitable 
and/or unjust circumstances."" (quotation omitted)); VRG Corp. v. GKN Realty Corp., 135 N.J. 539, 641 A.2d 519, 526 (N.J. 
1994) (""To establish unjust enrichment, a plaintiff must show both that defendant received a benefit and that retention of that 
benefit without payment would be unjust.""); Schmidt v. Household Fin. Corp., II, 276 Va. 108, 661 S.E.2d 834, 838 (Va. 2008) 
(""To state a cause of action for unjust enrichment, [a plaintiff has] to allege that: (1) he conferred a benefit on [the defendant]; (2) 
[defendant] knew of the benefit and should reasonably have expected to repay [plaintiff]; and (3) [defendant] accepted or 
retained the benefit without paying for its value.""). Although the Virginia rule statement does not expressly require that retention 
of the benefit be unjust, such a requirement is routinely read into the elements by Virginia courts. See, e.g., R.M. Harrison Mech. 
Corp. v. Decker Indus., Inc., 75 Va. Cir. 404, 2008 WL 10669311, at *3 (2008) (""The circumstances of the acceptance or 
retention of the benefit must render it inequitable for the defendant not to compensate the plaintiff.""). "
1008,14," The body shops have consistently argued that they did not have an opportunity to bargain because the insurance companies 
offered the market rate on a ""take it or leave it"" basis and that the insurance companies refused to negotiate. If this is all that is 
necessary to circumvent the rule that parties who are able to negotiate should be held to do so, the rule will quickly become 
extinct. "
1009,15," I submit that the body shops' allegation of force should be disregarded as a conclusory allegation. No concrete facts have 
been alleged from which might arise a reasonable inference of force."
1009,16," For that matter, I see no reason why the majority's logic cannot just as readily be employed as a weapon by consumers 
against the body shops. Suppose a consumer's car is badly damaged and cannot be driven. Not wanting his insurance rates to 
increase, he decides to pay for the repairs out of pocket. If one of the body shops charges him an amount in excess of what he 
thinks he should pay, has he been ""forced"" to pay that amount? Is it ""involuntary""? Is he permitted to sue the body shop and 
have a court determine the reasonable price of the repair? Is this really what federal courts should be doing? These questions, 
and many more, are left unanswered in the majority's opinion."
1009,17," Notably, both parties in this example agree that the painter is entitled to some amount ($10,000) just as both parties in our 
instant case agree that body shops are entitled to some amount (the State Farm ""market rate""). The failure to contract then in 
both cases is for an amount beyond what was agreed to."
1009,18," The majority suggests that a mere disparity in bargaining power can invalidate a contract. Maj. Op. at 29. However, the 
majority cites no case law or other authority to support the novel proposition that mere bargaining power or mere market power 
is sufficient to invalidate a contract. Moreover, the body shops have not even argued on appeal that a disparity in bargaining 
power could invalidate a contract, or that it could render unjust the insurance companies' retention of the benefits conferred. 
Thus, any such argument, not being fairly raised on appeal, is abandoned. See, e.g., Sapuppo v. Allstate Floridian Ins. Co., 739 
F.3d 678, 681-83 (11th Cir. 2014)."
1009,19," This is, of course, on top of the fact that if a couple of other developers all independently decide to pay no more than our 
hypothetical price leader, the entire group can now be hit with antitrust violations if the majority opinion and its logical 
consequences are to be the law of this Circuit. "
1010,20," See A&E Auto Body, Inc. v. 21st Century Centennial Ins. Co., 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 184070, 2015 WL 12867010, at *5 (M.D. 
Fla. Jan. 22, 2015) (""[I]n unjust enrichment case, . . . 'a third party providing services to an insured confers nothing on the insurer 
except a ripe claim for reimbursement.'"" (quoting Adventist Health Sys./Sunbelt Inc. v. Med. Sav. Ins. Co., 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
30976, 2004 WL 6225293, at *6 (M.D. Fla. Mar. 8, 2004)))."
1010,21," These alternative grounds largely mirror the basis on which I would affirm the district court's decision to dismiss the unjust 
enrichment claims—namely that the retention of a benefit (if any) would not be unjust where the body shops knew how much the 
insurance companies would pay before undertaking the repair and where they also forwent an opportunity to bargain."
1010,22," New Jersey has found a benefit to a prison where a private hospital treated an inmate on its behalf. Saint Barnabas Med. Ctr. 
v. Essex County, 111 N.J. 67, 543 A.2d 34 (N.J. 1988). While certainly analogous, that case is factually distinguishable based, 
among other things, on the legal duty a jailer owes to inmates. A federal district court in Kentucky has addressed a similar 
question in the health insurance context. See Appalachian Reg'l Healthcare v. Coventry Health & Life Ins. Co., 2013 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 44393, 2013 WL 1314154 (E.D. Ky. Mar. 28, 2013). Any conclusions that are drawn therein are obviously not binding on 
us or the Kentucky state courts. I have not seen any indication that the Virginia or Missouri courts have addressed this question."
1010,23," Compare Myrtle Beach Hosp., Inc. v. City of Myrtle Beach, 341 S.C. 1, 532 S.E.2d 868 (S.C. 2000), with Emergency 
Physicians Integrated Care v. Salt Lake County, 2007 UT 72, 167 P.3d 1080 (Utah 2007). "

of a valid business relationship or expectancy; (2) that [defendant] was aware of this relationship or expectancy; (3) that 
[defendant] intentionally interfered; (4) that the motive behind the interference was improper; (5) causation; and (6) special 
damages.""); Clinch v. Heartland Health, 187 S.W.3d 10, 14 (Mo. Ct. App. 2006) (""The elements of tortious interference with a 
business relationship are: (1) The plaintiff was involved in a valid business relationship; (2) the defendant was aware of the 
relationship; (3) the defendant intentionally interfered with the relationship, inducing its termination; (4) the defendant acted 
without justification; and (5) the plaintiff suffered damages as a direct result of defendant's conduct.""); Lamorte Burns & Co., Inc. 
v. Walters, 167 N.J. 285, 770 A.2d 1158, 1170 (N.J. 2001) (""To prove its claim, plaintiff must show that it had a reasonable 
expectation of economic advantage that was lost as a direct result of defendants' malicious interference, and that it suffered 
losses thereby.""); Dunlap v. Cottman Transmission Sys., LLC, 287 Va. 207, 754 S.E.2d 313, 318 (Va. 2014) (""The necessary 
elements to establish a prima facie case are: (1) the existence of a valid contractual relationship or business expectancy; (2) 
knowledge of the relationship or expectancy on the part of the interferor; (3) intentional interference inducing or causing a breach 
or termination of the relationship or expectancy; and (4) resultant damage to the party whose relationship or expectancy has 
been disrupted. . . . [A] plaintiff, in order to present a prima facie case of tortious interference, must allege and prove not only an 
intentional interference, but also that the defendant employed improper methods."" (alterations and quotations omitted)). "
1013,28," The majority's explicit reliance on market power in the contexts of both tortious interference and unjust enrichment (see supra, 
note 18), and the prominence of the majority's recitation in its Part II.A of the facts relating to market dominance, lead me to fear 
that the majority may have implicitly relied on market power in its resolution of other claims. In the price-fixing context for 
example, I fear that this concern may have lured the majority into holding that market power, coupled only with consciously 
parallel conduct, is sufficient to warrant an inference of agreement or conspiracy to fix prices notwithstanding the absence of any 
plausible factual allegations giving rise to such inference, and notwithstanding that the actual facts indicate that convergent 
pricing (especially in light of the price leadership) would be the expected course of events. If the majority is implicitly holding that 
market power—coupled only with consciously parallel conduct in the form of price leadership—is a sufficient plus factor to 
warrant an inference of agreement or conspiracy for antitrust purposes, I respectfully submit that such a complex and novel 
holding should be explored only after thorough briefing and full analysis. In any event, I would disagree with any such holding for 
at least two reasons: first, that argument has not been fairly raised in the body shops' appellate briefing, and therefore has been 
abandoned, see, e.g., Sapuppo v. Allstate Floridian Ins. Co, 739 F.3d 678, 681-83 (11th Cir. 2014) (""A party fails to adequately 
'brief' a claim when he does not 'plainly and prominently' raise it . . . .""); and second, even if market power could in an 
appropriate case be considered to have any relevance in the ""plus factor"" analysis—an issue which I need not address—it would 
not warrant an inference of agreement or conspiracy in the instant case where convergent pricing is so clearly to be expected. "

1022,2," Dennis Muse, one of the audit partners at Reznick, arid a former employee of the SEC Division of Corporate Finance, testified 
that the SEC ""no further comment"" letter of February 22, 2008 served to support the position that Reznick ""perhaps would have 
been in the position to take"" on the ERPS issue and to give Reznick more comfort with the accounting treatment of them. T. 598-
599. Mr. Muse's opinion seems to be based on the belief that the 2008 letter was responsive to the comments and responses 
involving the 2004 10-K, which was not, in fact, the case. T. 598. "
1034,3," This list of elements apparently finds its origin in 3. J. Dooley, Modern Tort Law, § 44.03 (1977), quoted in Storch v. Richer, 57 
Md, App. 683, 703 (1984). See also Bagwell v. Peninsula Regional Medical Center, 106 Md. App. 470 (1995); Blondell v.

1047,6," In Cardtoons, L.C. v. Major League Baseball Players Ass'n, 208 F.3d 885 (10th Cir. 2000), the court held that prelitigation 
threats communicated solely between private parties are not protected. It reasoned that they were not within the scope of the 
protection afforded by the Petition Clause of the First Amendment, as it applies outside the antitrust context. "
1050,7," Mr. McGrath did not render an opinion about excess fees based on the difference between Reznick's fees and BDOTs, Telos 
contends that even if the court does not rule in its favor on Counts One and Three, it is still appropriate to use Goodman as a 
baseline. It argues that Reznick's fees were inflated because of the higher risk profile that Reznick assigned due to the 
engagement, and that the reason that Reznick assigned this higher risk profile was due to Hamot and Siegel's conduct. Telos 
also contend? that the court can calculate the fee differential for Reznick, by applying the percentage changes from Audit 
Analytics to Reznick's fees for the 2007 audit on a year by year basis. It argues that it is not necessary to have an expert witness 
perform a mattiematical calculation when the record provides the methodology and all of the information-i.e., the inputs-needed 
to make that calculation, citing Cohee v. Global Horizons, Inc., 310 Fed. Appx. 579 (4th Cir. 2009), In the view that the court takes of this evidence, it is unnecessary to consider these issues. "

1089,2," Indivior, Inc. (""Indivior) was formerly incorporated under the name of Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals, Inc. In December 
2014, Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals, Inc. was demerged from its prior parent, the Reckitt Benckiser Group PLC, into 
Indivior PLC. (Am. Compl. ¶ 11.) Although the Amended Complaint used the name ""Reckitt"" throughout the document, Indivior is 
technically the named defendant in this case. To avoid confusion as to the appropriate defendant, I will refer only to Indivior as 
Moving Defendant."
1089,3," When determining whether to grant a motion to dismiss, a federal court must construe the complaint liberally, accept all well-
pleaded factual allegations in the complaint as true and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff. Fowler v. UPMC 
Shadyside, 578 F.3d 203, 210-11 (3d Cir. 2009). In accordance with this principle, the recitation of the facts assumes the truth of 
the factual statements in the Amended Complaint. "
1090,4," The FDA may designate a drug as an ""orphan drug"" when it determines that either (a) the drug is intended for the safe and 
effective, treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a rare disease or disorder that affects fewer than 200,000 people in the United 
States; or (b) the disease or disorder affects greater than 200,000, but the manufacturer is not reasonably expected to recover 
the costs of developing and marketing the treatment drug from sales in the United States. (Id. ¶ 35.) After designation as an 
orphan drug, the FDA approves the drug for marketing. (Id. ¶ 36.) It then becomes eligible for a seven-year exclusivity period 
during which it may be marketed as a brand-name drug free from generic competition. (Id.) "
1091,5, The United States District Court for the District of Delaware has invalidated the '832 patent. (Id. ¶ 52.)
1091,6," The REMS is a document provided by the manufacturer and contains a risk management plan or risk-minimization strategy that 
goes beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of a drug outweigh the risk. (Id. ¶ 58.) "
1093,7," HN4[
] Under § 505 of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, any individual may submit a ""citizen petition"" asking the FDA to 
take, or refrain from taking, certain administrative action. (Id. ¶ 99.) Such petitions are commonly used to express concerns 
about the safety or legality of a product. (Id.) Pursuant to 21 C.F.R. § 10.30, the FDA then has 150 days to respond to the citizen 
petition. (Id. ¶ 100.) During that period, FDA approval of any ANDA pending for the subject product is typically delayed, leading 
to some abuse by brand-name manufacturers in filing baseless citizen petitions in order to prolong their monopolies. (Id. ¶ 101.) "
1095,8," Notably, Plaintiffs also bring a claim for attempted monopolization under the Sherman Act § 2. HN8[
] ""A claim of attempted monopolization under § 2 of the Sherman Act must allege '(1) that the defendant has engaged in predatory or anticompetitive 
conduct with (2) a specific intent to monopolize and (3) a dangerous probability of achieving monopoly power.'"" Broadcom, 501 
F.3d at 317 (quoting Crossroads Cogeneration Corp. v. Orange & Rockland Utils., Inc., 159 F.3d 129, 141 (3d Cir. 1998)). As the 
sole element at issue for both the monopolization and the attempted monopolization claims is whether Indivior engaged in 
anticompetitive conduct, I address both claims together."
1095,9," HN9[
] Monopoly power is ""the ability to control prices and exclude competition in a given market."" Broadcom Corp., 501 F.3d at 307. Although monopoly power can be demonstrated through direct evidence, id., the ""more common way that a party may 
prove monopoly power is by providing indirect evidence, which includes 'structural evidence of a monopolized market.'"" Mylan 
Pharms. Inc. v. Warner Chilcott Pub. Ltd. Co., 838 F.3d 421, 435 (3d Cir. 2016) (quoting Harrison Aire, Inc. v. Aerostar Int'l, Inc., 
423 F.3d 374, 381 (3d Cir. 2005)). To support a claim of monopoly power through indirect evidence, a plaintiff must show that (1) 
the defendant had market power in the relevant market and (2) that there were barriers to entry into the market. Id. The Third 
Circuit ""generally require[s] a plaintiff alleging antitrust injury under Section 2 to show that [the] [d]efendant[] maintained a market 
share ""significantly larger than 55%"" to establish antitrust liability."" Id. at 437 (citations omitted). In the present case, Plaintiffs allege that the relevant product market is any drug with co-formulated buprenorphine/naloxone as 
the active ingredients for the treatment of opioid addiction, including both Suboxone film and Suboxone tablets together with any 
AB-rated generics, (Am. Compl. ¶ 19), and the relevant geographic market is the United States and its territories. (Id. ¶ 21.) 
Plaintiffs contend that before October 8, 2009, Suboxone was the only co-formulated buprenorphine/naloxone opioid treatment 
because of its orphan drug status, thus allowing Indivior to enjoy 100 percent of the market share in the United States and its 
territories. (Id. ¶ 22.) Even after the exclusivity period expired, Indivior's branded Suboxone products, including the film 
introduced in September 2010, remained the sole source of buprenorphine/naloxone until two generic manufacturers introduced 
generic tablets in March 2013. (Id.) After the generics were approved, Indivior's market share for co-formulated 
buprenorphine/naloxone dropped to sixty-eight percent. (Id.) These allegations suffice to satisfy the first element of section two 
Sherman Act claim. "
1096,10," Plaintiffs argue that I must examine defendant's conduct as a whole, rather than as a set of isolated acts, while Defendant 
asserts that I must separately consider each individual theory. Notably, Plaintiffs' Sherman Act § 2 claim sets forth an overall 
scheme of anticompetitive behavior rather than stating separate causes of action for each individual anticompetitive act. HN12[ ] The Third Circuit has held that ""the courts must look to the monopolist's conduct taken as a whole rather than considering 
each aspect in isolation."" LePage's Inc., 324 F.3d at 162; see also City of Anaheim v. S. Cal. Edison Co., 955 F.2d 1373, 1376 
(9th Cir. 1992) (""[I]t would not be proper to focus on specific individual acts of an accused monopolist while refusing to consider 
their overall combined effect . . . We are dealing with what has been called the 'synergistic effect' of the mixture of the 
elements.""). Particularly at the motion to dismiss stage, allegations of multiple forms of anticompetitive conduct may be 
considered collectively to determine whether a plaintiff has plausibly pled a section 2 claim under the Sherman Act. See W. 
Penn Allegheny Health System, 627 F.3d at 109-10. Nevertheless, the Third Circuit has clarified that ""[t]he relevant inquiry is the anticompetitive effect of [a defendant's] exclusionary 
practices considered together."" LePage's Inc., 324 F.3d at 162 (emphasis added). Logically, then, if none of the alleged conduct 
is exclusionary or anticompetitive, it cannot collectively violate section 2 of the Sherman Act. See Eatoni Ergonomics, Inc. v. 
Research in Motion Corp., 486 F. App'x 186, 191 (2d Cir. 2012) (""[When] alleged instances of misconduct are not independently 
anti-competitive . . . they are not cumulatively anticompetitive either.""). Accordingly, I will separately consider the product 
hopping allegation and delay allegations to determine whether at least one of them can substantiate a claim of anticompetitive 
conduct. "
1100,11," In fact, in another recent case, HN20[
] the Third Circuit reaffirmed the long-standing principle that ""[t]he test is not total 
foreclosure,"" but whether the challenged practices ""bar a substantial number of rivals or severely restrict the market's ambit,"" i.e. "
1101,," ""substantial foreclosure."" Eisai, Inc. v. Sanofi Aventis U.S., LLC, 821 F.3d 394, 403 (3d Cir. 2016) (quoting Dentsply Int'l, 399 
F.3d at 191)."
1101,12," HN22[
] A price disconnect is where a disconnect exists between the person paying for the prescription (the consumer) and 
the person selecting the appropriate treatment (the physician), thereby derailing the ordinary market forces that would allow 
consumers to consider price when selecting a product. In re Suboxone Antitrust Litig.,     F.R.D.    , 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
83499, 2016 WL 3519618, at *1 (E.D. Pa. June 28, 2016). "
1102,13," Moving Defendant also contends that the requirement of foreclosure is not met by allegations that Indivior avoided state 
substitution laws by developing and marketing film. It again cites to the Doryx decision in which the Third Circuit found the record 
to be ""void of any evidence of anticompetitive conduct"" notwithstanding the plaintiffs' allegations that the defendants' product 
hops impaired the generics' ability to benefit from state substitution laws. Doryx, 838 F.3d at 430, 440. The facts in Doryx are substantially distinguishable. In Doryx, the capsules were available for more than twenty years, and 
generic companies were free to engineer their own versions during that time. Id. at 438. When the plaintiff entered the market, it 
had 180 days of exclusive rights to market and sell its tablets, allowing it to set its tablet prices higher than the price of branded 
Doryx for at least some period of time and to reap generous profits from its sale of the generic tablet. Id. The Third Circuit did not 
find that reliance on state substitution laws to allege foreclosure was insufficient; rather it found that the plaintiff ""failed to satisfy 
its burden of demonstrating that Defendants engaged in anticompetitive conduct prohibited by the Sherman Act."" Id. at 439. In the present case, Plaintiffs rely not only on the state substitution laws, but also on Moving Defendant's marketing campaign, 
misrepresentations about the safety of the tablet, and initiation of a ""hard switch."" They further allege resulting injury in the form 
of ""paying more for co-formulated buprenorphine/naloxone than they would have paid in a competitive market."" (Am. Compl. ¶ 
124.) Thus, even if the state substitution laws are inconsistent among the various States or are insufficient to establish 
foreclosure, the totality of plaintiffs' allegations could allow a finding of anticompetitive behavior. "
1103,14," This provision states, ""[n]o holder of an approved covered application shall use any element to assure safe use required by the 
Secretary under this subsection to block or delay approval of an application under section 355(b)(2) or (j) of this title or to

1104,16, I address the citizen petition claim in more detail below. 
1105,17," This provision states: The Secretary shall not delay approval of a pending application submitted under subsection (b)(2) or (j) of this section or 
section 262(k) of Title 42 because of any request to take any form of action relating to the application, either before or 
during consideration of the request, unless— (i) the request is in writing and is a petition submitted to the Secretary pursuant to section 10.30 or 10.35 of title 21, Code of 
Federal Regulations (or any successor regulations); and (ii) the Secretary determines, upon reviewing the petition, that a delay is necessary to protect the public health. Consideration of the petition shall be separate and apart from review and approval of any application."
1105,21, U.S.C. § 355(q)(1)(A). 
1106,18," In the 2017 Opinion on Moving Defendant's Motion to Dismiss the Amneal Complaint, I considered and rejected the identical 
argument that Amneal could not allege injury and causation because it had not properly alleged that its ANDA was fully 
approvable prior to the date on which the citizen petition was filed. In so holding, I relied on allegations that ""Amneal has 
plausibly alleged that Indivior's misconduct in filing the citizen petition delayed approval of its ANDA and cost lost sales"" and that 
but for the filing of the citizen petition, Amneal would have begun marketing the generic version of Suboxone well before it 
actually did. Suboxone, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 627, 2017 WL 36371, at *10. That reasoning is equally applicable to the present 
case."
1106,19," By way of a Notice of Supplemental Authority, Defendant has referred me to the Third Circuit's August 17, 2017 decision in In 
re Wellbutrin XL Antitrust Litigation, MDL Dkt. No. 305. In that case, the Third Circuit, in part, affirmed a grant of summary 
judgment in favor of a defendant pharmaceutical manufacturer on a claim that the defendant had, among other things, entered 
into a conspiracy to submit a ""sham"" citizen petition to the FDA. Defendant now contends that this ruling bolsters the Motion to 
Dismiss in three specific respects: (1) it establishes with certainty the proposition that a plaintiff must prove not only that a 
petition was a sham, but that it caused an antitrust injury by delaying generic competition; (2) it rejected a similar conspiracy 
theory and declined to find that joint conduct directed toward developing and marketing new products is an unlawful conspiracy 
that violates the Sherman Act; and (3) it required a showing of actual foreclosure of generics in order to establish antitrust injury. Moving Defendant's reading of Wellbutrin, however, ignores the crucial fact that this case was decided at the summary judgment 
stage. The Third Circuit specifically acknowledged that a sham lawsuit citizen petition which causes a delay in generic entry 
would not be entitled to immunity under the Noerr-Pennington doctrine and could give rise to an actionable antitrust violation. 
Slip. Op. at 27-28. The Court, however, affirmed the grant of summary judgment on the ground that the appellants had failed to 
produce evidence creating a genuine issue of material fact as to the questions of (a) whether the lawsuits/citizen petition caused 
an actual delay into the entry of generics into the market and (b) whether the appellees conspired to file the sham petition as 
opposed to acting independently. Slip Op. at 34, 37, 38, 42. Contrary to Moving Defendant's argument, nothing in Wellbutrin 
escalates the pleading burden on a plaintiff setting forth antitrust and conspiracy violations based on the filing of a sham petition. 
Nor does the Third Circuit ever suggest that product hop allegations must be dismissed for failure to allege foreclosure. As set 
forth in detail in this Memorandum, I have found that Plaintiffs in this case have sufficiently pled that the citizen petition was a 
sham, that it resulted in a delay in generic entry, and that Defendants Indivior and MonoSol conspired to file this petition for the 
precise purpose of delaying generic entry and avoiding competition with Suboxone. "
1107,20," Moving Defendant also contends that these claims fail because the ""product hop"" claim itself is defective. As I have already 
found that the product hop claim survives Rule 12(b)(6) scrutiny, I need not consider this argument any further. "
1111,21," In an effort to dismiss Plaintiffs' Count V state law claims, Defendant presents a cursory two-sentence argument, as follows: The States' state-law claims fail for the same reasons as their federal-law claims. As discussed in more detail in Section IV 
of Reckitt Benckiser Healthcare (UK) Limited's brief, since Plaintiffs fail to state a claim under the Sherman Act and since 
the state law claims are based on the same allegations, those claims [should] also [b]e dismissed. (Def.'s Mem. Supp. Mot. to Dismiss 4). As I do not find that the Sherman Act claims fail, I likewise do not find that the state law 
claims fail. To the extent Reckitt Benckiser Healthcare (UK) Limited raises additional reasons to dismiss the state law claims, I 
will address them in the context of deciding that motion. "
1116,1," The court takes judicial notice of the Ixchel-Forward Agreement because the First Amended Complaint repeatedly references it. 
See United States v. Ritchie, 342 F.3d 903, 908 (9th Cir. 2003)."
1116,2," Plaintiff alleges that Biogen viewed the new DMF drug as a competitive threat to its sales of Tecfidera and control over the 
market for DMF drugs for treating neurological diseases. (FAC ¶ 28.)"

Dreiling v. Am. Express Co., 458 F.3d 942, 946 n.2 (9th Cir. 2006). "
1117,4," Antitrust standing is distinct from Article III standing. Plaintiff also does not appear to have Article III standing because it has not 
allegedly suffered an actual or imminent injury in fact, and this alone would be enough to dismiss the First Amended Complaint. 
See Clapper v. Amnesty Int'l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 409, 133 S. Ct. 1138, 185 L. Ed. 2d 264 (2013); Maya v. Centex Corp., 658 
F.3d 1060, 1067 (9th Cir. 2011) (injury in fact must be ""actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical""); cf. Brotech Corp. v. 
White Eagle Int'l Techs. Grp., Inc., No. Civ.A.03-232, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11552, 2004 WL 1427136, at *6 (E.D. Pa. June 21, 
2004) (antitrust injury too speculative where there were insufficient allegations regarding how far plaintiff has gone in seeking 
""FDA approval, when such approval may be anticipated, or whether it will be prepared to enter to product market"" upon FDA 
approval). "
1118,5," Plaintiff also points to First Fin. Sec., Inc. v. Freedom Equity Grp., LLC, Case No. 15-cv-01893-HRL, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
133551, 2017 WL 3593369 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 21, 2017) as evidence that Reeves is limited to at-will employment contracts. 
However, the First Financial court declined to state whether the application of Reeves is necessarily limited to such a narrow set 
of facts and chose to leave the question open, commenting that the Reeves court did not express an opinion, and it remains 
unclear, whether ""a plaintiff must prove an independently wrongful act"" for an interference that differed from the type in Reeves.

designation. "
1130,1," As Valspar and our dissenting colleague point out, Matsushita involved an alleged conspiracy that did not make ""economic 
sense,"" 475 U.S. at 587, and the Court declined to draw liberal inferences because the defendants ""had no rational economic 
motive to conspire,"" id. at 596. While these unlikely-to-succeed conspiracies provide one good reason to be circumspect in our 
inferences, we have explained that oligopolistic interdependence provides another good reason for inferential modesty. See Flat 
Glass, 385 F.3d at 358 (""[D]espite the absence of the Matsushita Court's concerns, this Court and others have been cautious in 
accepting inferences from circumstantial evidence in cases involving allegations of horizontal price-fixing among oligopolists."" 
(emphasis added)); Chocolate, 801 F.3d at 397 (explaining that ""despite the facial plausibility of the Plaintiff's theory and the 
circumstantial evidence supporting it, we must be cautious. . . . [since] the U.S. chocolate market is a textbook example of an 
oligopoly and we cannot infer too much from mere evidence of parallel pricing among oligopolists"" (citation omitted)). While the dissent's interpretation of Matsushita is reasonable, it is contrary to Third Circuit jurisprudence. In Chocolate, we held 
that a plaintiff in an oligopoly case must provide inferences that show that the alleged conspiracy is ""more likely than not."" 801 
F.3d at 412. And in Flat Glass, we considered and rejected the dissent's more limited reading of Matsushita by acknowledging 
that some scholars think our extension of Matsushita is ""an unfortunate misinterpretation"" of that case while nonetheless 
continuing our ""circumspect approach."" 385 F.3d at 359 & n.9 (citation omitted)."
1130,2," If a plaintiff provides direct evidence, then the ""strictures of Matsushita [do] not apply."" Petruzzi's IGA Supermarkets, Inc. v. 
Darling-Delaware Co., 998 F.2d 1224, 1233 (3d Cir. 1993). That is because ""no inferences are required from direct evidence to 
establish a fact and thus a court need not be concerned about the reasonableness of the inferences to be drawn from such 
evidence."" Id. Valspar's appeal does not involve direct evidence of conspiracy, and such evidence is rare in price-fixing cases. 
See In re Plywood Antitrust Litig., 655 F.2d 627, 633 (5th Cir. 1981) (""[S]olemnized covenants to conspire are difficult to come by 
in any price fixing case.""). "
1131,3," Valspar seems to argue that proof of a tacit agreement among the suppliers—that is, an awareness that they were engaging in 
conscious parallelism—should suffice to meet this factor. We disagree. HN7[
] While tacit agreements remain illegal under § 1, Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 553, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007), the third plus factor requires evidence 
implying traditional (i.e., explicit) conspiracy. See Flat Glass, 385 F.3d at 361 (requiring proof of an ""actual, manifest agreement 
not to compete"" (citation omitted)). As a practical matter, tacit conspiracy and conscious parallelism are difficult to differentiate, if 
such differentiation is possible at all. See Andrew Gavil, Antitrust Law in Perspective: Cases, Concepts, and Problems in 
Competition Policy 311 (2d ed. 2008) (""[The] boundary between tacit agreements—to which Section 1 applies—and parallel 
pricing stemming from oligopolistic interdependence"" is not clear.); George A. Hay, Horizontal Agreements: Concept and Proof, 
51 Antitrust Bull. 877, 894-95 & n.46 (2006) (theorizing how to distinguish between a tacit agreement and oligopolistic 
interdependence—""[i]f that can be done""—while noting that the distinctions might totally be lost on a jury). We have tried to 
eradicate this confusion by placing emphasis on the third plus factor and requiring ""traditional conspiracy"" evidence. See Flat 
Glass, 385 F.3d at 360-61. In other words, we realized that the type of evidence that might prove a ""tacit"" conspiracy (e.g., 
motive, actions against self-interest, parallel behavior, etc., Interstate Circuit v. United States, 306 U.S. 208, 225-28, 59 S. Ct. 
467, 83 L. Ed. 610 (1939)) in the context of oligopolies can be unhelpfully equivocal, and thus decided to focus on evidence 
generally required to show an explicit, manifest agreement. Moreover, the sort of proof that would generally count towards 
proving a tacit conspiracy is largely accounted for in different parts of our oligopoly summary judgment framework. See Baby 
Food¸166 F.3d at 121-23, 130 (considering parallel pricing before the plus factors); Flat Glass, 385 F.3d at 360 (considering 
actions against self-interest and motive as part of first two plus factors). HN8[
] Although we do not rule out the possibility that 
evidence of a tacit agreement could suffice to meet this factor when a plaintiff also offers non-economic evidence of a traditional 
conspiracy—for example, when Company A proposes a parallel price increase to Company B, and Company B does not 
explicitly agree but then follows suit when Company A raises its prices, see Interstate, 306 U.S. at 222—economic evidence 
alone cannot demonstrate a tacit agreement under our oligopoly cases."
1131,4," While the dissent wonders HN10[
] what it will ""now take for a plaintiff relying on circumstantial evidence to move the ball 
across the goal line,"" Dissent at 6, the above precedents already resolve that question. Namely, the plaintiff's inferences must 
show that conspiracy is ""more likely than not."" Chocolate, 801 F.3d at 412. That may be a high bar—but it is the bar established 
by this Court and binding on this panel. "
1132,5," Indeed, this same mistake pervades Valspar's argument. As the District Court aptly explained, Valspar generally ""neglects the 
theory of interdependence."" Valspar, 152 F. Supp. 3d at 248. For example, despite the central role ""conscious parallelism"" and 
""interdependence"" play in our oligopoly caselaw, each of those phrases appear only once in Valspar's opening brief."
1132,6," Valspar also notes that the suppliers' executives denied engaging in ""follow the leader pricing."" Valspar Br. 15. Essentially, 
Valspar is arguing that we should infer a conspiracy from this potential pretext. That argument fails under our caselaw because 
HN12[
] ""pretextual reasons are insufficient to create a genuine issue of fact without other evidence pointing to a price-fixing 
agreement."" Chocolate, 801 F.3d at 411 (alterations omitted) (quoting Miles Distribs. v. Specialty Constr. Brands, Inc., 476 F.3d 
442, 452 (7th Cir. 2007))."
1132,7," Thus, the circumstances here are different than those in Flat Glass, where we stated that ""[a]n agreement to fix prices is a per 
se violation of the Sherman Act even if most or for that matter all transactions occurred at lower [than list] prices."" 385 F.3d at 
362 (citation and alteration omitted). Here, we find significant not just that actual prices occurred below announced prices, but 
that actual prices occurred below announced prices because alleged conspirators frequently undercut other members of the 
alleged conspiracy. We are mindful that a ""failed attempt to fix prices"" is illegal, id. at 363, but it is likewise significant that the 
alleged conspirators behaved contrary to the existence of a conspiracy. "
1133,8," Although the first two plus factors may, at times, ""do more than restate economic interdependence,"" Flat Glass, 385 F.3d at 
361 n.12, Valspar has not shown that they do so here. For example, despite the dissent's insistence to the contrary, there is no 
evidence of record showing ""unilateral exchanges of confidential price information,"" which is one example of an action against 
self-interest that may not simply be a result of interdependence. See Dissent at 10 (quoting Flat Glass, 385 F.3d at 361 n.12); 
see also infra Part IV-B-2 (discussing the information exchanges shown to have occurred between the suppliers). "
1134,9," In addition, Valspar would have us give the expert's conclusion an outsized role in the summary judgment analysis. HN19[
] 
While we have explained that a district court should not ""impermissibly weigh[]"" expert evidence by picking out ""potential flaws,"" 
Petruzzi's, 998 F.2d at 1241, that does not mean that a district court is obligated to accept an expert's legal conclusions, 
Dalberth v. Xerox Corp., 766 F.3d 172, 189 (2d Cir. 2014). Although Valspar's expert, Dr. Williams, concluded that its evidence 
excludes the inference that the competitors acted independently, that conclusion was based on predicates that are insufficient 
under our caselaw. For example, Dr. Williams took the type of evidence that we have said is of diminished value in the oligopoly 
context (i.e., parallel price movement and evidence best considered under the first two plus factors) and from there concluded 
that the suppliers had illegally conspired. The District Court was correct to reject this line of argument and note that the evidence 
from which the expert based his conclusions is ""not necessarily . . . evidence of an agreement"" under our oligopoly caselaw. 
Valspar, 152 F. Supp. 3d at 243."
1134,10," The dissent claims that we ignore this precedent and ""required[] Valspar to present evidence of direct meetings and 
conversations."" Dissent at 20. Not so. There is no doubt that a plaintiff can satisfy this plus factor with circumstantial evidence, 
but that circumstantial evidence must indicate the existence of an ""actual, manifest agreement not to compete."" Flat Glass, 385 
F.3d at 361 (citation omitted). While Valspar marshals circumstantial evidence of anticompetitive behavior, the record does not 
show the existence of an actual agreement. "
1135,11," Additionally, the GSP most resembled a data collection program blessed by the Ninth Circuit in In re Citric Acid Litigation, 
where a centralized trade association ""collected figures on production and sales from each of its members, audited this 
information on an annual basis, and produced statistics aggregated by country on citric acid production and sales."" 191 F.3d 
1090, 1098 (9th Cir. 1999). That court called the program ""wholly legal"" and explained that it was ""uncontested that these 
activities served the legitimate purpose of informing members of [market] conditions."" Id. "
1136,12," Although Valspar and the dissent contend that the competitors implemented their conspiracy through public announcements of 
their price increases, these e-mails reflect that, even if such ""signalling"" occurred, it was not in furtherance of any prior 
agreement. Had the competitors ""got[ten] together and exchanged assurances of common action or otherwise adopted a 
common plan,"" Flat Glass, 385 F.3d at 361, there would have been no need for DuPont to resort to public announcements to 
""test"" whether its competitors were ""receiving/understanding [its] price increase messages."" See Williamson Oil Co. v. Philip 
Morris USA, 346 F.3d 1287, 1310 (11th Cir. 2003) (refusing to infer a conspiracy from signalling among oligopolists absent 
evidence that it was in furtherance of an agreement); Blomkest Fertilizer, Inc. v. Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan, 203 F.3d 1028, 
1037 (8th Cir. 2000) (same)."
1136,13," The dissent reads these e-mails differently, arguing that they show the competitors (1) often ""would not undercut one another's 
prices [(2)] and that they were involved in an organization (i.e., cartel) controlling prices."" Dissent at 11 (emphasis added) 
(citation omitted). We agree with the first proposition, but that is a natural consequence of oligopolistic interdependence. See 
Flat Glass, 385 F.3d at 359. As for the second proposition, we do not see enough evidence in the record to support it. While the 
internal e-mails indicate that the suppliers knew their pricing decisions may be consciously parallel and that their collective 
interests would at times be aligned, the e-mails do not evidence an explicit agreement to fix prices—and often show that such an 
agreement was lacking. "
1137,14," Our dissenting colleague claims that, in the foregoing section, we went through ""each individual piece of evidence and 
disregard[ed] it if we could feasibly interpret it as consistent with the absence of an agreement to raise prices."" Dissent at 19 
(citation omitted). That misunderstands our mode of analysis. For the sake of coherence, we presented and discussed each 
piece of evidence separately, and found that no single piece on its own, made a conspiracy more likely than not. (After all, if a 
single piece of evidence made conspiracy more likely than not, Valspar would survive summary judgment and our task would 
end.) We now consider the evidence together to determine whether the entire body of evidence—viewed in context—tips the 
scale in Valspar's favor. 30 "
1138,15," Contrary to Valspar's contention, HN26[
] our caselaw does not foreclose the possibility that a plaintiff can defeat summary judgment with only circumstantial evidence in the Section 1 oligopoly context. That circumstantial evidence, however, must be 
non-economic evidence of an actual agreement between the conspirators, and not just a restatement of the interdependent 
economic conduct that we must accept in an oligopolistic marketplace. See Petruzzi's, 998 F.2d at 1242 (""mere consciously 
parallel behavior alone is insufficient to prove a conspiracy, [but] it is circumstantial evidence from which, when supplemented by 
additional evidence, an illegal agreement can be inferred."" (emphasis added)). As explained above, Valspar has not provided 
circumstantial non-economic evidence sufficient to support the inference of a conspiracy. "
1139,1," Based on this sliding scale approach—first articulated in Matsushita—courts have taken varying approaches to cases 
depending on the strength of the plaintiff's theory. Compare Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 588-91 (refusing to draw liberal inferences 
from plaintiffs' ""predatory pricing"" theory, which posited that multiple companies conspired to lower prices, because a conspiracy 
to lower prices makes no economic sense), with Petruzzi's, 998 F.2d at 1232 (drawing liberal inferences and reversing summary 
judgment because the plaintiff's theory, that companies conspired not to compete with each other, made ""perfect economic 
sense""), and [**33]  Flat Glass, 385 F.3d at 358 (drawing liberal inferences in reversing summary judgment given that ""an 
agreement among oligopolists to fix prices . . . makes perfect economic sense"")."
1139,2," We discuss the plausibility of Valspar's economic theory in greater detail infra. For now, it is enough to say we have previously 
held that Valspar's exact economic theory (parallel price fixing among oligopolists) makes perfect economic sense: ""an 
agreement among oligopolists to fix prices at a supracompetitive level . . . makes perfect economic sense."" Flat Glass, 385 F.3d 
at 358. "
1140,3," I share the concern of the amicus—namely, that it would be an absurd result if, ""in situations 'in which the danger of [parallel 
pricing] is most serious,"" liability would actually be ""less likely."" Amicus Br. at 15 (quoting Louis Kaplow, Competition Policy & 
Price Fixing 126 (2015)). A plain reading of our case law reveals this Court never intended to ramp up a price-fixing plaintiff's 
burden of proof, especially when the plaintiff's economic theory makes perfect economic sense. Chocolate, 801 F.3d at 396-97; 
Flat Glass, 385 F.3d at 358. In fact, courts must do the opposite in such a scenario by drawing liberal inferences in favor of the 
plaintiff. Id. "
1142,4," The majority simply states, without consideration of the actual evidence, that ""Valspar has not shown"" that the first two plus 
factors ""do more than restate the theory of interdependence."" Majority at 20 n.9. The actual evidence, discussed supra and infra, 
shows otherwise."
1142,5," In re Titanium Dioxide Antitrust Litig., 959 F. Supp. 2d 799, 812-13 (D. Md. 2013). "
1143,6," Citing to one single DuPont email, the majority reasons that ""[h]ad the competitors got[ten] together and exchanged assurances 
of common action or otherwise adopted a common plan, . . . there would have been no need for DuPont to resort to public 
announcements to 'test' whether its competitors were 'receiving/understanding [its] price increase messages."" Majority at 29 
n.14. While it may be possible to reach this conclusion by reading one email in isolation, the evidence as a whole creates a 
reasonable inference that there was more likely than not an agreement to fix prices. For example, evidence of the meetings 
between Fisher and all the alleged conspirators, as well as the actual meetings of top executives from Kronos and Huntsman 
(followed almost immediately by a parallel price increase announcement), as well as the conspirators all discussing ""improving 
pricing"" does create an inference of ""a common plan."" "
1144,7," The majority criticizes Valspar's reliance on legal scholarship as opposed to case law. This is interesting given that (1) this 
Court has long turned to legal scholarship to inform their decisions in antitrust cases involving oligopolists, and (2) the majority 
itself cites to legal scholarship—including multiple law review articles—seven times."
1144,8," For example, say Company A has a 30% market share in a particular industry and Company B has a 40% market share in that 
industry. Obviously, Company A and B, assuming they are competitive, would want to acquire as much market share for 
themselves as possible. Therefore, it would defy all logic and notions of procompetitive behavior for Company A (who has a 
lower market share) to take affirmative actions to stay at 30% rather than grow beyond a 30% market share."
1144,9," Titanium Dioxide, 959 F. Supp. 2d at 814."
1144,10," A ""true-up"" occurs when companies in a conspiracy redistribute their individual gains and losses in order to comply with their 
conspiratorial agreement. Kovacic et al., Plus Factors, at 423. Such a transaction ""leads to a strong inference of collusion"" since 
there is ""no reasonable noncollusive explanation"" for intercompany sales at ""nonmarket prices"" between companies that are 
supposed to be competing with one another. Id. "
1145,11," To use another example, say Company A enjoys 35% of the market share, while Company B has 50% of the market share. 
Assume A and B are colluding and, thus, they want to raise prices and maintain market shares per their agreement. Then 
assume that Company A's share drops to 33%. Company B may sell a very small amount of product to Company A simply to 
allow Company A to maintain its market share. Mistaking this as an insignificant sale, merely because of its size or lack of 
frequency, would be an oversight."
1145,12," Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 states: ""The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no 
genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). Simply 
because courts must exercise caution in these types of cases does not do away with Rule 56's proposition that genuine disputes 
of material fact preclude summary judgment: ""Generally, the movant's burden on a summary judgment motion in an antitrust 
case 'is no different than in any other case.'"" Intervest, 340 F.3d at 159. In these cases, courts still must deny summary judgment 
if there is a genuine dispute of material fact and ""view the facts and any reasonable inferences drawn therefrom in the light most 
favorable to the party opposing summary judgment."" Id. (emphasis added) (citing Eastman Kodak, 504 U.S. at 456). The 
majority did not do this. Also contrary to the majority's entire analysis, the ""special consideration"" and ""caution"" we apply in these 
types of cases informs—not supplants—the general guidelines found in Rule 56."
1145,13," Titanium Dioxide, 959 F. Supp. 2d at 829. "
1146,14," The District Court read this to mean the ""collective needs"" of Millennium alone. However, read in the context of the entire 
email, a reasonable jury could certainly conclude the opposite: that the author was referring to the collective needs of the TiO2 
industry members."
1146,15," In re Titanium Dioxide, 959 F. Supp. 2d at 812-13 (quoting Fisher) (emphasis added)."
1146,16," The majority does not discuss this particularly damning evidence, but states generally that ""the record does not show the 
existence of an actual agreement."" Majority at 23 n.11. Contrary to the majority's insistence, an actual agreement can be shown 
in the exact way that Valspar has set out to do so in this case. See Areeda & Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law ¶ 1422b, at 171 (3d 
ed. 2010) (""Although . . . mere proof of interdependent pricing, standing alone, may not serve as proof of an antitrust violation, 
we believe that the evidence concerning the purpose and effect of price announcements, when considered together with the 
evidence concerning the parallel pattern of price restorations, is sufficient to support a reasonable and permissible inference of 
an agreement, whether express or tacit, to raise or stabilize prices."") (emphasis added). "
1147,17," DuPont's insistence that it did not begin attending TDMA meetings until 2010 is moot given that it attended CEFIC meetings—
long before 2010—that were concurrent with the TDMA meetings. Valspar, 152 F. Supp. 3d at 246 n.5."
1147,18," Titanium Dioxide, 959 F. Supp. 2d at 811."
1147,19," Obviously, based on this evidence, and other evidence of Fisher's cross-company communications, a reasonable jury could 
infer that no direct conversations between the TiO2 manufacturers were needed if Fisher acted as their mouthpiece. "
1148,20," In re Titanium Dioxide, 959 F. Supp. 2d at 812-13. "
1149,21," DuPont relied on the requirement that, to survive summary judgment, Valspar must present evidence that ""tends to exclude 
the possibility"" that the alleged conspirators acted independently. Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 588. All of the evidence in this case, 
viewed in its totality, tends to exclude that the TiO2 manufacturers acted independently. Contrary to DuPont's interpretation, 
""tends to exclude the possibility"" does not mean ""unequivocally excludes the possibility."" Such a standard would defy our basic 
summary judgment jurisprudence, which views the evidence in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party."
1149,22," In an attempt to assuage concerns about its analysis, the majority tries to justify its heightened standard through Chocolate. 
According to the majority, this Circuit's precedent has long required a plaintiff in this type of case to prove that it is ""more likely 
than not"" true that there was a price-fixing conspiracy in order to survive summary judgment. Majority at 9 n.1, 13, 13 n.4, 29-30, "
1150,29," n.14. The majority makes too much of this dicta. This was not, as the majority claims, some profound announcement of a new 
legal standard or rule. Indeed, this purportedly axiomatic language has never once been used in any other price-fixing case 
involving oligopolies. See generally Matsushita, 475 U.S. 574, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (not using this language 
anywhere); Monsanto, 465 U.S. 752, 104 S. Ct. 1464, 79 L. Ed. 2d 775 (same); Flat Glass, 385 F.3d 350 (same); Baby Food, 
166 F.3d 112 (same). The use of that phrase in Chocolate simply reflected the Court's conclusion that the plaintiffs, in that 
particular case, had not been able to point to any reasonable inferences of a conspiracy. Even assuming arguendo this alleged 
""standard"" were actually the measuring stick, the plaintiffs in this case have certainly met it. "
1152,1," On consideration of the Motion, this Court assumes the facts alleged in the Amended Complaint to be true. See United States 
ex rel. Raynor v. Nat'l Rural Utils. Co-op. Fin., Corp., 690 F.3d 951, 955 (8th Cir. 2012). The Court also draws upon the 
documents attached to the Amended Complaint for background information. See Miller v. Redwood Toxicology Lab., Inc., 688 
F.3d 928, 931 (8th Cir. 2012)."
1152,2," Defendants do not move to dismiss the following three counts: Count I, which alleges breach of contract against PepsiCo 
based on violation of exclusive territorial rights; Count II, which alleges breach of contract against PepsiCo based on 
unauthorized increases in concentrate price; and Count V, which alleges tortious interference with contracts and prospective 
economic advantage against both Defendants. "
1153,3," PepsiCo is engaged in other businesses as well. For example, it owns the Frito-Lay brand and sells snack foods, and it owns 
the Quaker Oats brand and sells breakfast cereals."
1153,4," As defined in the documents attached to the Amended Complaint, Mahaska's exclusive territory consists of the southeast Iowa 
counties of Marion, Mahaska, Keokuk, Washington, Jefferson, Wapello, Monroe, Lucas, and Appanoose, as well as portions of 
Jasper and Powesheik Counties. The EBA has been amended over time to include additional geographical territories in 
Nebraska and Kansas and also to include additional PepsiCo products, though the territory amendments were not attached to 
the Amended Complaint. "
1154,5," The Amended Complaint quotes extensively from the factual recitations in Pepsi-Cola Bottling Co. of Pittsburg. The Court may 
consider these materials of public record as factual background on a motion to dismiss. See Wieland v. U.S. Dep't of Health & 
Human Servs., 793 F.3d 949, 953 (8th Cir. 2015)."
1154,6," Mahaska's precise allegation is that it ""does not agree to blindly participate in any CIA or MIA arrangements."" Am. Compl. ¶ 35. "
1157,7," In addition, neither document attached to Mahaska's brief contains anything that would alter the Court's analysis. Exhibit B 
merely restates in graphical form the allegations in Paragraph 50 of the Amended Complaint. Exhibit A, meanwhile, provides "
1158,," substantiation for Mahaska's allegations about PepsiCo's intent to exercise greater control over its independent bottlers, but the 
analysis below does not depend on allegations about PepsiCo's intent."
1158,8, Defendants do not appear to dispute that Mahaska has adequately alleged this element.
1158,9," Suits for injunctive relief under § 16 of the Clayton Act possess the same antitrust injury requirement, but a plaintiff need not 
show actual injury; a ""threatened injury"" will suffice. Cargill, Inc. v. Monfort of Colo., Inc., 479 U.S. 104, 111, 107 S. Ct. 484, 93 L. 
Ed. 2d 427 (1986). "
1160,10," Since Mahaska alleges that PepsiCo has already increased concentrate prices, this looming price increase presumably refers 
to the prices charged by bottlers to retailers for finished CSD products."
1160,11," PepsiCo's contractual duties should be distinguished with any duties imposed by the antitrust laws, however. Those duties 
may or may not overlap. See In re Adderall XR Antitrust Litig., 754 F.3d 128, 135 (2d Cir. 2014) (""The mere existence of a 
contractual duty to supply goods does not by itself give rise to an antitrust 'duty to deal.'"")."
1160,12," Technically, Mahaska alleges that PepsiCo either operates PBC at a loss or sells concentrate to PBC at a price significantly 
lower than the concentrate is sold to Mahaska, which Mahaska alleges violates the Robinson-Patman Act's prohibition on price 
discrimination. This alternative theory is discussed later. "
1161,13," Mahaska appears to argue both that harm to competition can be found without establishing dangerous probability of 
recoupment and that a defendant accused of predatory pricing can harm competition in a plaintiff's market even if the defendant 
does not sell into that market, in both instances relying on Utah Pie Co. v. Continental Baking Co., 386 U.S. 685, 87 S. Ct. 1326, 
18 L. Ed. 2d 406 (1967). In Brooke Group Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 509 U.S. at 221-22, however, the 
Supreme Court implicitly overruled Utah Pie, labeling it an ""early judicial inquiry."" See also Coastal Fuels of Puerto Rico, Inc. v. 
Caribbean Petrol. Corp., 79 F.3d 182, 191 (1st Cir. 1996) (recognizing Utah Pie's implicit overruling in Brooke Group); Rebel Oil 
Co. v.Atl. Richfield Co., 51 F.3d 1421, 1445 n.16 (9th Cir. 1995) (same). "
1162,14," Mahaska cites United States v. American Airlines, Inc., 743 F.2d 1114, 1116-17 (5th Cir. 1984), and argues that a plaintiff 
does not need to allege an agreement to monopolize to state a claim for attempted joint monopolization. American Airlines 
stands for the proposition that an express invitation to fix prices by one competitor to another can suffice to establish attempt 
liability even if no agreement was reached. Id. at 1118. The Amended Complaint makes no such allegation. "
1163,15," Mahaska's predatory-pricing-conspiracy allegations are made even more implausible by the fact that the Amended Complaint 
contains no allegations whatsoever about DPSG's behavior. The Amended Complaint contains no allegations regarding whether 
DPSG engages in campaigns with national retailers regarding the prices for finished CSD products in a manner similar to 
PepsiCo's CDAs. Nor does the Amended Complaint allege any facts regarding efforts by DPSG to set or influence pricing for Dr. 
Pepper-branded finished CSD products distributed by independent bottlers such as Mahaska, even though Mahaska actually 
distributes DPSG products. In Twombly, it was not enough that the complaint in question alleged mere parallel conduct among 
purported co-conspirators—the Amended Complaint here lacks even that. See Twombly, 550 U.S. at 553 (""While a showing of 
parallel 'business behavior is admissible circumstantial evidence from which the fact finder may infer agreement,' it falls short of 
'conclusively establish[ing] agreement or . . . itself constitut[ing] a Sherman Act offense.'"" (alterations in original) (quoting Theater 
Enterprises, Inc. v. Paramount Film Distrib. Corp., 346 U.S. 537, 540-41, 74 S. Ct. 257, 98 L. Ed. 273 (1954))). "
1164,16," A plaintiff may also establish monopoly power based on direct evidence of control of prices or exclusion of competitors. 
PepsiCo, Inc. v. Coca-Cola Co., 315 F.3d 101, 107 (2d Cir. 2002) (per curiam). "
1165,17," The Amended Complaint has nothing to say about PBC's market share other than that PBC sells Pepsi products in 80% of the 
United States, which is not actually a market share allegation, and that the companies that were merged into PBC together 
accounted for about 75% of Pepsi-brand sales in 2009. As discussed above, the Amended Complaint does not allege a market 
of Pepsi-brand products only, and such an allegation would likely be insufficient as a matter of law. "
1168,18," By contrast, had a retailer who competes with Dollar General made a price discrimination claim against Defendants regarding 
the conduct alleged herein, that would be called a ""secondary-line injury"" claim and the question of whether an injury to 
competition was pled would be evaluated differently. See, e.g., Best Brands Beverage, Inc. v. Falstaff Brewing Corp., 842 F.2d 
578, 584 n.1 (2d Cir. 1987) (""A primary-line violation occurs where the discriminating seller's price discrimination adversely 
impacts competition with his—the seller's—competitors. In contrast, a secondary-line violation occurs where the discriminating 
seller's price discrimination injures competition among his customers, i.e., purchasers from him."" (citations omitted))."
1168,19," Mahaska's state claims are incongruous with their federal-law counterparts in one respect worth noting. Count VII sets forth a 
predatory pricing claim pursuant to Iowa Code § 553.4. Section 553.4 is the Iowa Competition Law's analogue to § 1 of the 
Sherman Act, which prohibits anticompetitive agreements. The analogue to Sherman Act § 2, which prohibits monopolization 
(anticompetitive unilateral conduct), is Iowa Code § 553.5, pursuant to which Mahaska pleads its state-law ""Attempt to 
Monopolize"" claim. This suggests that Mahaska's Iowa-law predatory pricing claim should be analyzed in harmony with case law 
interpreting Sherman Act § 1 rather than § 2. But predatory pricing claims are generally analyzed under § 2 of the Sherman Act, 
which prohibits unilateral conduct constituting monopolization (such as price-setting policies), not § 1, which prohibits certain 
anticompetitive agreements. See ZF Meritor, LLC v. Eaton Corp., 696 F.3d 254, 277 (3d Cir. 2012) (holding that predatory 
pricing case law interpreting § 2 is relevant where price itself forms the ""predominant method of exclusion,"" and that rule of 
reason analysis under § 1 is appropriate where non-price provisions in contracts form the bedrock of plaintiff's theory of harm to 
competition). Nevertheless, to analyze whether predatory pricing agreements violate § 1, this Court would assess whether 
Mahaska has plausibly alleged that pricing-agreements harmed competition, which yields the same result as analysis above. 
See KLM Royal Dutch Airlines v. Amber Air Intern., Ltd., No. 89 C 4953, 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15067, 1992 WL 281409, at *20 
(N.D. Ill. Oct. 5, 1992); Sewell Plastics, Inc. v. Coca-Cola Co., 720 F. Supp. 1196, 1217-18 (W.D.N.C. 1989); cf. Atl. Richfield 
Co. v. USA Petrol. Co., 495 U.S. 328, 340, 110 S. Ct. 1884, 109 L. Ed. 2d 333 (1990) (""Low prices benefit consumers regardless 
of how those prices are set, and so long as they are above predatory levels, they do not threaten competition. . . . We have 
adhered to this principle regardless of the type of antitrust claim involved.""). "
1170,20," Regarding whether Mahaska was willing to do business with Family Dollar, Mahaska alleges elsewhere in the Amended 
Complaint that it cannot meet the prices expected by Family Dollar. "
1177,1, Whether these allegations are sufficient to establish Plaintiffs' claims is discussed separately below. 
1185,*," Judge Gregory H. Woods, of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation. "
1186,1," In this opinion we refer to FedEx Corporation as ""FedEx Corp.,"" FedEx Corporate Services, Inc. as ""FedEx Services,"" and 
FedEx Ground Package System, Inc. as ""FedEx Ground."" We refer collectively to the three companies as ""FedEx."""
1186,2," The District Court also granted summary judgment to FedEx on BikerGear's class action RICO claims because the shipping 
contracts contained class action waivers. U1IT4Less, Inc. v. FedEx Corp., No. 11-cv-1713 (KBF), 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 82933, 
2015 WL 3916247 (S.D.N.Y. June 25, 2015). As we affirm the dismissal of BikerGear's individual RICO claims, we express no 
view on whether the District Court properly did so based on the class action waivers. "
1188,3," Typically, this occurs when shippers like BikerGear charge their customers based on the freight bill—providing the carriers' 
invoices as proof—but receive off-bill discounts from the carriers. The shippers pocket the savings, and the customers wind up 
paying more than the net freight charges."
1188,4," Section 13708, entitled ""Billing and collecting practices,"" provides in full as follows: (a) Disclosure.--A motor carrier subject to jurisdiction under subchapter I of chapter 135 shall disclose, when a document 
is presented or electronically transmitted for payment to the person responsible directly to the motor carrier for payment or 
agent of such responsible person, the actual rates, charges, or allowances for any transportation service and shall also 
disclose, at such time, whether and to whom any allowance or reduction in charges is made. (b) False or misleading information.--No person may cause a motor carrier to present false or misleading information on 
a document about the actual rate, charge, or allowance to any party to the transaction. (c) Allowances for services.--When the actual rate, charge, or allowance is dependent upon the performance of a service 
by a party to the transportation arrangement, such as tendering a volume of freight over a stated period of time, the motor 
carrier shall indicate in any document presented for payment to the person responsible directly to the motor carrier that a 
reduction, allowance, or other adjustment [**11]  may apply. "
1189,5," Otherwise, there would be many more than the twenty-five cases or so that have cited Section 13708 in the twenty-two years 
since the provision was enacted. Cf. Solo, 819 F.3d at 799 (""Neither we nor our sister circuits have yet examined the scope of § 
13708."")."
1189,6," We decline to decide whether the statute extends only to the disclosure of off-bill discounts, as the District Court believed, 896 
F. Supp. 2d at 294, and not to off-bill surcharges. But see Regulations Implementing Section 7, 1994 WL 94482, at *2 
(interpreting pre-ICCTA statute to ""govern[] any discounts, allowances, or adjustments that come out of the published tariff 
charge or contract rate shown on the freight bill,"" but not to ""cover charges assessed in addition to those specified in the tariff or 
contract.""). Here, BikerGear alleges neither off-bill discounts nor off-bill surcharges."
1189,7," Because we hold that BikerGear has not alleged conduct covered by Section 13708(b), we express no view on whether a 
private right of action exists for violations of Section 13708, or whether BikerGear sufficiently identified a ""person"" who ""caused"" 
a ""motor carrier"" to present false information. See Solo, 819 F.3d at 799-800 (discussing the distinction between the terms 
""person"" and ""motor carrier"")."
1189,8," HN6[
] A RICO enterprise is ""a group of persons associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a course of 
conduct,"" the existence of which is proven ""by evidence of an ongoing organization, formal or informal, and by evidence that the 
various associates function as a continuing unit."" United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 583, 101 S. Ct. 2524, 69 L. Ed. 2d 246 
(1981). "
1190,9," One academic survey of the differing circuit law on this issue explains that HN9[
] in our circuit, ""where an association in fact 
enterprise is allegedly comprised of a subsidiary, with or without agents, controlled by a parent corporation,"" the existence of a 
single corporate consciousness can be disproven by showing that the alleged criminal activities are distinguishable from the 
subsidiary's ordinary business. See Laurence A. Steckman, RICO Section 1962(c) Enterprises and the Present Status of the 
""Distinctness Requirement"" in the Second, Third and Seventh Circuits, 21 Touro L. Rev. 1083, 1096-97, 1270, 1281 (2006). "
1191,10," For example, there is no record evidence that FedEx Ground's operations were infiltrated for racketeering activity. See 
Steckman, supra note 9, at 1096."
1191,11," Elsewhere in its opinion, the Supreme Court strove repeatedly to limit and distinguish its holding. See id. at 163 (explaining 
that the purpose of incorporation is to create a legal entity distinct from ""the natural individuals who created it, who own it, or 
whom it employs""); id. at 164 (noting that Second Circuit cases involving corporate entities ""involved significantly different 
allegations compared with the instant case""); id. at 165 (""[I]n [the] present circumstances the statute requires no more than the 
formal legal distinction between 'person' and 'enterprise' (namely, incorporation) that is present here."" (emphasis added)); id. at 
166 (noting that the Court's holding ""says only that the corporation and its employees are not legally identical""); id. (holding 
""simply"" that RICO ""applies when a corporate employee unlawfully conducts the affairs of the corporation of which he is the sole 
owner""). "
1192,12," The concurrence emphasizes that we do not here endorse the ""facilitation"" test that the District Court adopted and that some 
of our sister circuits have imposed. See ClassicStar Mare, 727 F.3d at 492 (""[C]orporate defendants are distinct from RICO 
enterprises when they are functionally separate, as when they perform different roles within the enterprise or use their separate 
legal incorporation to facilitate racketeering activity.""); Bucklew, 329 F.3d at 934 (requiring plaintiffs to show that ""the enterprise's 
decision to operate through subsidiaries rather than divisions somehow facilitated its unlawful activity""); see also David B. Smith 
& Terrance G. Reed, Civil RICO ¶ 3.07[2][a] (2017) (explaining that most circuits ""hold that a subsidiary corporation cannot 
constitute the enterprise through which a defendant parent corporation conducts racketeering activity, at least in the absence of 
exceptional circumstances, such as a showing that the subsidiary was set up solely for the purpose of perpetrating a fraud""). But 
even if we adopted such a test, we agree with the District Court that BikerGear failed to satisfy it in this case. See U1IT4Less, 
157 F. Supp. 3d at 350-52. "
1193,1," As the opinion notes, our Circuit's approach in Cruz, which cabins the Supreme Court's decision in Cedric to its facts, is 
consistent with that taken by a number of other federal courts. Several commenters have remarked on this trend. See, e.g., 
William B. Ortman, Parents, Subsidiaries, and RICO Distinctiveness, 73 U. Chi. L. Rev. 377, 398 (2006) (arguing that circuit 
courts have ""ignored the Supreme Court's repeated directives against the use of purposive interpretation to extratextually cabin 
RICO liability""); Laurence A. Steckman, RICO Section 1962(c) Enterprises and the Present Status of the ""Distinctness 
Requirement"" in the Second, Third and Seventh Circuits, 21 Touro L. Rev. 1083, 1296 (2006) (observing that ""Cedric . . . plainly 
stated that bare legal distinctness is all the 'distinctness' RICO requires. . . . The Second, Third and Seventh Circuits, plainly, 
remain committed to their pre-Cedric analytical paradigms."")"
1193,2," While decided two years after Cedric, Bucklew does not mention the Supreme Court's decision in its analysis. Moreover, the 
single paragraph of analysis of this issue in Bucklew relies on cases involving the Sherman Act, principally Copperweld Corp. v. 
Independence Tube Corp., 467 U.S. 752, 104 S. Ct. 2731, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628 (1984). Bucklew, 329 F.3d at 934. In Cedric, Mr. "
1194,," King argued that Copperweld supported a ruling in his favor. The Supreme Court rejected that argument, stating that its 
conclusion that legal separateness was all that was required by RICO was not ""inconsistent with antitrust law's intracorporate 
conspiracy doctrine; that doctrine [**24]  turns on specific antitrust objectives."" Cedric, 533 U.S. at 166. "
1197,1," The district court also concluded that Plaintiffs had failed to show anticompetitive injury, meaning that Plaintiffs' evidence was 
insufficient for the jury to conclude ""that loss or injury arose from the competition-reducing aspect of [Cox's] behavior."" In re Cox 
Enters., 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 152915, 2015 WL 7076418, at *2. On appeal, the parties dispute whether Plaintiffs needed to 
show antitrust injury, which we have defined as ""injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flows from 
that which makes defendant's acts unlawful."" Elliott Indus. Ltd. P'ship v. BP Am. Prod. Co., 407 F.3d 1091, 1124 (10th Cir. 2005) 
(quoting Reazin v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Kan., Inc., 899 F.2d 951, 962 n.15 (10th Cir. 1990)). We need not reach that 
question, however, because we agree with the district court that Plaintiffs failed to meet their burden to show that Cox foreclosed 
a substantial amount of competition, the fourth element of a per se tying claim. "
1198,," Similarly, because we affirm the district court, we decline to address the issues that Cox raises in its cross-appeal. Specifically, 
Cox asked us to review Plaintiffs' failure to define a viable tying product, the proper geographic market for the tying product, and 
a valid theory of damages, as well as Plaintiffs' failure to address the impact of the National Cooperative Research and 
Production Act, whether certain class members should have been excluded from the claim, whether the ""verdict in this case 
provides a permissible basis for awarding damages to the individual class members,"" and whether we must remand for a new 
trial ""because the jury instructions did not accurately convey the essential elements of a tying claim."" Appellee's Response Br. at 
4. "
1199,2," Only some types of antitrust claims receive per se treatment; all others are analyzed using a rule of reason. See Fortner 
Enters., Inc. v. U.S. Steel Corp., 394 U.S. 495, 499-500, 89 S. Ct. 1252, 22 L. Ed. 2d 495 (1969) (plaintiffs who fail to establish a 
per se tying violation ""can still prevail on the merits whenever [they] can prove, on the basis of a more thorough examination of 
the purposes and effects of the practices involved, that the general standards of the Sherman Act have been violated""). Under 
the rule of reason, plaintiffs must prove ""the actual effect of the [tying arrangement] on competition."" Jefferson Par., 466 U.S. at 
29. "
1203,3," Though the Second Circuit rejected the plaintiffs' claim because set-top boxes and premium cable services aren't two distinct 
products, its analysis supports the conclusion we reach here today—namely, that the tie at issue doesn't meet the per se rule's 
threshold requirements. "
1204,4," Neither Healy nor Cox addresses this regulation. Still, it is relevant to the issue at hand because it limits the amount of power 
Cox can obtain in the tied-product market."
1204,5," Courts need apply a rule-of-reason analysis to a per se tying claim only if plaintiffs argue that the tie is illegal under the rule of 
reason as well. See Fox Motors, 806 F.2d at 959 n.3 (""Because the challenged allocation system was not unlawful under the per 
se rule and because plaintiffs have not challenged its legality under the Rule or [sic] Reason, we need not consider whether the 
evidence of a conspiracy between defendants was sufficient.""). "
1205,6," A proper reading of the instruction does not cast off earlier requirements just because the instruction does not go to the trouble, 
and length, to repeat them in every sentence. When the last sentence is read as part of the whole instruction, it gives effect to 
earlier language, meaning this: ""If the dollar amount of [Cox's] leases of set-top boxes [achieved by the tying arrangement] was 
substantial, then you should find that [Cox] has foreclosed a substantial amount of commerce [to other sellers or potential sellers 
of set-top boxes in the market for set-top boxes]."""
1205,7," Plaintiffs argue that ""[e]ven if . . . the jury instructions were incomplete or incorrect, the remedy is a new trial under correct 
instructions and not judgment in favor of Cox."" Appellants' Response Br. at 23-24. But a new trial with a jury instruction that more 
clearly explained the foreclosure element wouldn't change the outcome of this case. As we explained above, the foreclosure element of a per se tying claim in our circuit requires a showing that the tie had the 
potential to or actually did harm competition in the tied-product market. Having ""been fully heard on [the] issue . . . there is no 
legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for [Plaintiffs]"" under the law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a)(1). In other 
words, the record shows that Cox's tie was not the sole—or even the primary—reason that Plaintiffs couldn't purchase set-top 
boxes or their alternatives from other manufacturers. See In re Cox Enters., 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 152915, 2015 WL 7076418, 
at *1 (""Plaintiff[s] failed to offer evidence from which a jury could determine that any other manufacturer wished to sell set-top 
boxes at retail or that Cox had acted in a manner to prevent any other manufacturer from selling set-top boxes at retail.""). 
Therefore, the tie didn't foreclose competition in the tied-product market and the district court properly granted Cox judgment as 
a matter of law under Rule 50(b). "
1208,8," Such support is not required. See Kaufman, 836 F.3d at 144 (""[T]he core issue is a cable provider's right to refuse to enable 
cable boxes it does not control to unscramble its coded signal."")."
1208,9," The former enabled Cox customers to receive one-way services without a set-top box, and the latter enabled them to receive 
two-way services without a set-top box. Importantly, though, both technologies still required additional hardware to work. The 
customer would need a CableCard- or Tru2Way-enabled television or a TiVo box to avoid having to purchase or rent a set-top 
box. As explained above, this functionality strongly indicates a need for the tie that is separate from Cox's desire to profit from 
set-top-box rentals. "
1209,10," Whether Cox should have required its sales force to explain to each customer exactly what was available with a set-top box 
versus CableCard technology is a different question that is irrelevant to whether the tie foreclosed a substantial amount of 
commerce. Cox supported the CableCard and Tru2Way technologies, meaning that it spent money to make its systems 
compatible with both technologies. When asked, Cox sales representatives accurately told customers what they could obtain by 
using CableCard."
1209,11," Plaintiffs point out that Congress passed the 1996 Telecommunication Act to ""assure the commercial availability, to 
consumers . . . of . . . equipment used . . . to access multichannel video programming and other services offered over 
multichannel video programming systems, from manufacturers, retailers, and other vendors not affiliated with any multichannel 
video programming distributor."" Appellants' Opening Br. at 15 (quoting 47 U.S.C. § 549). But this law does nothing to help their 
cause. As Plaintiffs explain, this law led to the development of CableCard and Tru2Way, which both failed for technological 
reasons. Kaufman, 836 F.3d at 146. "
1210,12," We express no opinion here over whether Plaintiffs could have shown a ""contract, combination . . ., or conspiracy, in restraint 
of trade"" under § 1 of the Sherman Act. 15 U.S.C. § 1. Leaving aside testimony from set-top box manufacturers that Cox had 
nothing to do with their decision not to sell directly to consumers, Cox could have engaged in nefarious conduct with other cable 
companies that diminished competition in the set-top-box market. To protect their profits, cable companies could have banded 
together to dissuade manufacturers from selling set-top boxes at retail. But Plaintiffs don't make this claim, nor did they present 
evidence of any such behavior."
1210,13," Still, we note that Plaintiffs' claim would likely have failed either way. Because their claim failed under the more plaintiff-friendly 
per se analysis, it would also likely fail under the more demanding rule-of-reason analysis. See Areeda & Hovenkamp, supra, ¶ 
1726f (explaining that when a seller purchases the tied product from a third party, ""the very doubt that ousted per se treatment 
also makes it unlikely that an alleged tie of this character will be found to be unreasonable""). "
1212,1," Despite the majority's assertion that the Court ""modified its view of tying arrangements"" in Jefferson Parish, Maj. Op. at 9, the 
elements of a tying claim have always been, and continue to be, as they are stated in Jefferson Parish. See Eastman Kodak Co. 
v. Image Tech. Servs., 504 U.S. 451, 461-62, 112 S. Ct. 2072, 119 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1992) (""A tying arrangement . . . violates § 1 
of the Sherman Act if the seller has 'appreciable economic power' in the tying product market and if the arrangement affects a 
substantial volume of commerce in the tied market.'"" (quoting Fortner Enters., Inc. v. United States Steel Corp. (Fortner I), 394 
U.S. 495, 503, 89 S. Ct. 1252, 22 L. Ed. 2d 495 (1969))); Fortner I, 394 U.S. at 499 (""[Tying agreements] are unreasonable in 
and of themselves whenever a party has sufficient economic power with respect to the tying product to appreciably restrain free 
competition in the market for the tied product and a 'not insubstantial' amount of interstate commerce is affected."" (quoting Int'l 
Salt Co. v. United States, 332 U.S. 392, 396, 68 S. Ct. 12, 92 L. Ed. 20 (1947))); N. Pac. R.R. Co., 356 U.S. at 6 (same); Times-
Picayune Pub. Co. v. United States, 345 U.S. 594, 608-09, 73 S. Ct. 872, 97 L. Ed. 1277 (1953) (""When the seller enjoys a 
monopolistic position in the [**47]  market for the 'tying' product, or if a substantial volume of commerce in the 'tied' product is 
restrained, a tying arrangement violates the narrower standards expressed in § 3 of the Clayton Act because from either factor 
the requisite potential lessening of competition is inferred. And because for even a lawful monopolist it is 'unreasonable, per se, 
to foreclose competitors from any substantial market,' a tying arrangement is banned by § 1 of the Sherman Act whenever both 
conditions are met."" (emphasis added)). "
1214,2," Plaintiffs defined the tying product as ""premium cable."" Cox's particular product was called ""Advanced TV."" "
1215,3," Throughout the trial, there was much testimony designed to determine exactly which Advanced TV services were and were not 
available to consumers through other means, such as by ordering pay-per-view over the phone instead of through a set-top box. 
See, e.g., J.A. vol. L, at 6191; J.A. vol. LI, at 6366-67. Regardless of which or how many services consumers might have been 
able to acquire through other means, Cox conditioned the provision of Advanced TV on the rental of a set-top box. In order to 
acquire Advanced TV services, a consumer was forced to choose which type of set-top-box or cableCARD they wished to rent 
from Cox. There was no option to order Advanced TV without accepting equipment rental. J.A. vol. XXVII, at 4014-18. "
1222,1," Enterprise Software is a type of computer software program that enables core operational tasks - like payroll, human resource 
tasking, and inventory management - across an entire organization. Instead of being tied to a specific computer, Enterprise 
Software is hosted on a server and provides simultaneous access and service to a large number of users over a computer 
network. These features and functions are in contrast to typical computer software, which is generally a single-user application 
executed on a user's personal computer. A key feature of Enterprise Software is the ability to modify and customize the software 
for an entity's specific needs and to support the software through periodic updates to maintain the software's continuing 
functionality and compliance with regulatory and tax changes. "

1268,1," Two separate motions are addressed in this opinion: (1) the motion of Credit Suisse Group AG, Credit Suisse AG, The Royal

jurisdiction and failure to state a claim pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(6) [Doc. 63]; and (2) the motion of 
BlueCrest Capital Management Group, LLP, to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, lack of personal jurisdiction, and 
failure to state a claim pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(6) [Doc. 74]. "
1269,2," For example, if all twelve contributor banks submitted quotes, the bottom three and top three quotes would be discarded, with 
CHF LIBOR set as the average of the middle six quotes. "
1270,3," According to defendants, ""JPMorgan Chase & Co. is a financial holding company that was never a member of the panel of 
banks that submitted or contributed to Swiss franc LIBOR, though its affiliate was a panel bank. Similarly, Credit Suisse Group 
AG is a financial holding company that was never a member of the panel of banks that submitted or contributed to Swiss franc 
LIBOR, though its affiliate, Credit Suisse AG, was a panel bank."" Doc. 73 at 3 n.2."

1270,5," Deutsche Bank AG and DB Group Services UK Limited are collectively referred to as the ""Deutsche Bank Defendants."" "
1272,6," The Complaint attempts to supplement this ""handful"" through instances of defendants manipulating LIBOR for other currencies, 
such as Yen. See, e.g., Compl. ¶ 136. But plaintiffs cannot rely on manipulation of a separate currency to make out their claims 
here. See In re LIBOR-Based Fin. Instruments Antitrust Litig. (""LIBOR IV""), No. 11-MDL-2262, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 107225,

(Oct. 21, 2014), http://ec.europa.eu/competition/antitrust/cases/dec_docs/39924/39924_1156_3.pdf ."
1276,10," The conclusory suggestion in plaintiffs' brief (not the Complaint) that the various derivatives constitute ""one integrated . . . 
market"" as to bid-ask spreads — presumably to imply that manipulation of the spread for one derivative will affect the spread of 
the others — is far from evident. Unlike CHF LIBOR, which the Complaint alleges is a price input for every derivative, the bid-ask 
spreads are essentially alleged to be a transaction fee for the market making of specific derivative products. These derivatives 
are alleged to be distinct products that are sold separately, and the Complaint does not explain why manipulating the spread for 
one of these products necessarily or even plausibly manipulates the spread as to other separately sold types."
1276,11," Nor can plaintiffs bootstrap any harm suffered through CHF LIBOR manipulation into standing to represent a class affected by 
bid-ask spread manipulation, because the Complaint does not plausibly allege that these two alleged patterns of manipulation 
were part of the same conspiracy. That is, a group of defendants could have agreed to fix bid-ask spreads regardless of the CHF 
LIBOR rate, and vice versa, and there is no indication that the two conspiracies were part of one interwoven plot, as opposed to 
two separate sets of misconduct allegedly committed by the same entities."
1276,12," The Court reads the Complaint to allege bid-ask spread manipulation only in support of Count One, one of its two antitrust 
claims. But to the extent plaintiffs seek support from these allegations for their other claims as well, they lack standing to do so. 
And because plaintiffs lack Article III standing to sue for bid-ask spread manipulation, their arguments that this Court has 
personal jurisdiction over defendants likewise cannot be based on allegations of bid-ask spread manipulation. See Sunward 
Electronics, Inc. v. McDonald, 362 F.3d 17, 24 (2d Cir. 2004) (""A plaintiff must establish the court's jurisdiction with respect to 
each claim asserted.""); In re LIBOR-Based Financial Instruments Antitrust Litigation, (""LIBOR VI""), No. 11-mdl-2262, 2016 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 175929, 2016 WL 7378980, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 20, 2016) (""The first step in evaluating personal jurisdiction in a 
conspiracy case is to define the scope of the conspiracy, because only acts taken pursuant to that conspiracy are jurisdictionally 
relevant.""). "
1278,13," Plaintiffs argue in their briefing, but fail to allege in the Complaint, that CHF LIBOR, if nothing else, provided a ""starting point"" 
from which the interest rates used in the ""generic formula"" and negotiated between the contracting parties were calculated. Doc. 
109 at 6. A similar argument was recently accepted by the Second Circuit in vacating and remanding a decision that plaintiffs 
who had transacted in various LIBOR-based securities had failed to allege antitrust injury based on the defendants' LIBOR 
manipulation. See Gelboim v. Bank of Am., 823 F.3d 759, 776 (2d Cir. 2016). There, ""the district court observed that LIBOR did 
not necessarily correspond to the interest rate charged for any actual interbank loan."" Id. (citation omitted). The Second Circuit 
concluded that ""[t]his is a disputed factual issue that must be reserved for the proof stage,"" but reasoned that ""even if none of the 
appellants' financial instruments paid interest at LIBOR"" they might nonetheless suffer antitrust injury ""based on the influence 
that a conspiracy exerts on the starting point for prices."" Id. Thus, showing that LIBOR is not a mechanical and inflexible input 
into the price of a derivative does not necessarily foreclose a sufficient link between the LIBOR rate and the price of a derivative. 
But because this ""baseline"" theory was not advanced in the Complaint, and because the Court finds that a relationship between 
CHF LIBOR and the price of plaintiffs' derivatives has been adequately alleged without reference to that theory, the Court need 
not consider it here. "
1279,14," Plaintiffs' description of these derivatives is cursory, and just as additional information may cast doubt on plaintiffs' claim that 
CHF LIBOR affects the price of CHF futures and FX forwards, so too may it undermine plaintiffs' claim that the different types of "
1280,," derivatives are affected by CHF LIBOR in similar ways and thus implicate the same set of concerns. But that is a question for 
another day. See Fernandez, 222 F. Supp. 3d at 373."
1280,15," As noted, the Foreign Defendants also move to dismiss the Complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. 
P. 12(b)(2). Courts ""traditionally treat personal jurisdiction as a threshold question to be addressed prior to consideration of the 
merits of a claim,"" but ""that practice is prudential and does not reflect a restriction on the power of the courts to address legal 
issues."" ONY, Inc. v. Cornerstone Therapeutics, Inc., 720 F.3d 490, 498 n.6 (2d Cir. 2013). Here, as in Sullivan v. Barclays, 
""[d]efendants' arguments as to personal jurisdiction turn in part on the substance of their motion to dismiss for failure to state a 
claim."" 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25756, 2017 WL 685570, at *11 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 21, 2017). For example, whether plaintiffs have 
plausibly alleged that the Foreign Defendants conspired within the United States bears on not only the personal jurisdiction 
analysis, but also whether an antitrust claim has been adequately stated and whether plaintiffs' RICO claims are impermissibly 
extraterritorial. Moreover, the Court has received full briefing on the motions to dismiss for both lack of personal jurisdiction and 
failure to state a claim. Many of the Complaint's deficiencies on both fronts may possibly be corrected through an opportunity to 
amend, and it would be a waste of judicial resources for such opportunity to be afforded as to personal jurisdiction without any 
analysis on the other issues presented for the Court's consideration. Accordingly, the Court addresses both the personal 
jurisdiction and 12(b)(6) arguments, and concludes that the analysis is better structured by tackling the latter first. "
1281,16," Compare LIBOR I, 935 F. Supp. 2d at 687-96 (dismissing antitrust claim for lack of competitive injury because LIBOR is a 
cooperative process); Laydon, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46368, 2014 WL 1280464, at *7-8 (same), with In re Foreign Exchange 
Benchmark Rates Antitrust Litig., 74 F. Supp. 3d 581, 596 (S.D.N.Y. 2015) (rejecting motion to dismiss on this ground). "
1285,17," While these allegations do not cover the entire Class Period, with respect to RBS, questions of ""the conspiracy's scope may 
be raised later in litigation, but do not merit dismissal at this phase."" See In re Foreign Exchange Benchmark Rates Antitrust 
Litig. (""FOREX""), No. 13-cv-7789, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 128237, 2016 WL 5108131, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 20, 2016)."

Swiss franc LIBOR; Imposes €61.6 million fine on JPMorgan (Oct. 21, 2014), http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-14-
1189_en.htm ."
1285,19," The Complaint also alleges that Deutsche Bank submitted artificial quotes at the request of traders at DB Group Services, but 
a section one violation cannot be based on collusion between a parent and a subsidiary. See Copperweld, 467 U.S. at 771. "
1290,20," ""[P]laintiffs may ultimately recover only to the extent of their net injury, given that plaintiffs may well have benefited from LIBOR 
suppression in the same transaction or in a different transaction."" LIBOR VI, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 175929, 2016 WL 7378980, 
at *18. ""[I]f benefits accrued to [a plaintiff] because of an antitrust violation, those benefits must be deducted from the gross 
damages caused by the illegal conduct."" Id. (quoting Minpeco S.A. v. Conticommodity Servs., Inc., 676 F. Supp. 486, 489 
(S.D.N.Y. 1987)). "
1291,21," Plaintiffs do not even explain where this information would come from. They seek to sue on behalf of a class of every entity 
who bought trillions of dollars' worth of Swiss franc derivatives over the span of a decade through numerous different channels, 
including countless direct transactions that involved neither the named plaintiffs nor the defendants. It is not clear how 
information for all these transactions would either be gathered or analyzed to determine the effect of defendants' alleged 
manipulation. "
1292,22," While the Court does not assign substantial weight to this fact, it is notable also that the Complaint essentially piggybacks on 
regulatory settlements and statements of fact. Plaintiffs are manifestly not uncovering misconduct that went undiscovered or 
unaddressed by public enforcement mechanisms. "
1296,23," The DOJ Statement of Facts states that ""[s]tarting at least as early as 2001, and continuing at least until September 1, 2009, 
on each trading day on which UBS had Swiss Franc trading positions, UBS's Swiss Franc LIBOR submitters rounded UBS's 
Swiss Franc LIBOR submissions to benefit UBS's global Swiss Franc trading positions."" United States Department of Justice, 
Criminal Division, Fraud Section Non-Prosecution Agreement and Appendix A Statement of Facts with UBS AG (Dec. 18, 2012) 
at 30."
1296,24," See DOJ Deferred Prosecution Agreement and Attachment A Statement of Facts with Deutsche Bank AG, USA v. Deutsche 
Bank AG, No. 15cr61, Dkt. No. 6 (D. Conn. Apr. 23, 2015). "
1297,25," Section 22 of the CEA grants a private plaintiff who purchased or sold a futures contract standing to sue for ""manipulation of 
the price of any such contract . . . or the price of the commodity underlying such contract."" 7 U.S.C. § 25(a)(1)(D)(ii). Defendants 
argue that Divitto lacks standing to sue because the CHF LIBOR ""is not the commodity underlying the CME futures contracts;"" 
rather, the ""commodity underlying these futures is a contract to exchange 125,000 Swiss francs for U.S. dollars."" Doc. 73 at 30. 
But that is of no matter because standing may be conferred based on not only manipulation of ""the price of the commodity 
underlying such contract,"" but also on ""manipulation of the price of any such contract"" itself. 7 U.S.C. § 25(a)(1)(D)(ii). Had 
Divitto adequately alleged that he was injured by manipulation of the price of the CHF FX futures contract through manipulation 
of CHF LIBOR, he would have standing under the CEA. See LIBOR I, 935 F. Supp. 2d at 715 (""Plaintiffs have stated a [CEA] 
claim for commodities manipulation based on manipulation of the price of Eurodollars futures contracts.""). "
1298,26," The Complaint fails to plausibly allege manipulation in violation of the CEA against the Credit Suisse Defendants or BlueCrest 
because it does not plausibly allege that these defendants caused any manipulated CHF LIBOR submission, and thereby 
artificial prices of CHF futures contracts."
1298,27," Defendants also urge that specific intent has been inadequately alleged because ""Plaintiffs do not even claim to have bought 
or sold Swiss franc futures from the Defendants, and therefore fail to demonstrate that Defendants had a motive to manipulate 
the prices of such contracts."" Doc. 73 at 34-35. That argument is specious because — as defendants are well aware, and as 
discussed above — these derivatives were traded on an exchange instead of directly with any counterparty. As plaintiffs note, 
accepting defendants' position would mean that ""no plaintiff could bring a CEA manipulation claim, as lb]uyers and sellers of 
commodity futures do not deal directly with each other, but instead interact with a commodities exchange, which serves as a 
clearing house.'"" Doc. 86 at 43 (quoting In re Natural Gas, 337 F. Supp. 2d 498, 502 (S.D.N.Y. 2004)). Defendants cite no 
support for this proposition; rather, their own authorities confirm that CEA claims may be based on manipulation of derivatives "
1299,," sold on an exchange. See Hershey v. Energy Transfer Partners L.P., 610 F.3d 239, 249 (5th Cir. 2010) (holding that evidence 
defendants intended to ""impact the NYMEX natural gas futures market"" would be sufficient to establish manipulative intent). "
1300,28," At oral argument on the motions to dismiss, plaintiffs maintained that the UBS non-prosecution agreement did not put them on 
inquiry notice for CEA violations occurring after September 1, 2009, the last date covered by the agreement. But a 
nonprosecution agreement based on frequently recurring misconduct over a more than eight-year period is clearly sufficient to 
alert an investor of ordinary intelligence that the misconduct might have continued beyond the period covered by the agreement. 
This is only reinforced by the agreement's statement that this misconduct ""continued at least until September 1, 2009."" Doc. 77-
10, Sullivan Decl., Ex. 9, at ¶ 73 (emphasis added)."
1300,29," The first regulatory settlement concerning CHF LIBOR manipulation by a defendant other than UBS was not announced until 
February 6, 2013, which falls within the two-year CEA statute of limitations. "
1302,30," While the Complaint alleges that the Deutsche Bank Defendants colluded to manipulate CHF LIBOR, a RICO association-in-
fact enterprise generally cannot be comprised of solely a parent and a subsidiary. See U1IT4less, Inc. v. FedEx Corp., 157 F. 
Supp. 3d 341, 350-52 (S.D.N.Y. 2016). "
1303,31," Allegations that defendants other than RBS manipulated CHF LIBOR to profit from their transactions in CHF LIBOR-based 
derivatives at the expense of other market participants would also suffice to allege a scheme to defraud as to those defendants 
to the extent that the other elements of a RICO claim had been adequately pled. "
1304,32," Indeed, as defendants demonstrate in Appendix A to their memorandum in law in support of their motion to dismiss, many of 
the allegations track almost verbatim the allegations found insufficient in Laydon. See Doc. 73 App'x A. "
1306,33," The new documents affect the analysis only as to RBS because only RBS was alleged to have colluded with JPMorgan in 
New York to manipulate CHF LIBOR, and, as explained above, the Complaint does not plausibly allege that the remaining 
defendants joined any conspiracy between RBS and JPMorgan to manipulate CHF LIBOR. "
1309,34," Plaintiffs rely primarily on Matter of B&M Kingstone, LLC v. Mega Int'l Commercial Bank Co., Ltd., 131 A.D.3d 259, 15 
N.Y.S.3d 318 (1st Dep't App. Div. 2015), in which a bank with a New York branch agreed to provide information with respect to 
that branch in response to an information subpoena, but refused to produce similar information as to its branches outside of New 
York. The First Department held that ""the court's general personal jurisdiction over the bank's New York branch permits it to 
compel that branch to produce any requested information that can be found through electronic searches performed there."" Id. at 
267. While plaintiffs seize on the First Department's use of the phrase ""general personal jurisdiction,"" B&M Kingstone explicitly 
recognized that ""New York does not have general jurisdiction over [a registered bank's] worldwide operations."" 15 N.Y.S.3d at 
264. B&M held simply that a New York branch may be required to provide information available through that branch, not that 
New York Banking Law § 200(3) provides a court with general jurisdiction over a foreign bank. See In re: LIBOR-Based Fin. 
Instruments Antitrust Litig., 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 51190, 2016 WL 1558504, at *7. "
1315,35," Defendants note that Waldman also held the PLO was not subject to suit in the forum under the ""effects test,"" even though the 
alleged misconduct ""continuously hit Americans,"" because it could not be said that ""the United States [was] the focal point of the 
torts alleged."" 835 F.3d at 338. Here, defendants argue, the ""focal point"" of the manipulation was abroad, and thus specific 
jurisdiction is lacking. As an initial matter, in Waldman the Second Circuit found that the attacks were ""indiscriminate"" and 
""random,"" and thus ""were not expressly aimed at the United States."" Id. at 337. Here, by contrast, the alleged harm is not 
""random"" and ""indiscriminate"" because defendants are aware of where they transact in CHF LIBOR-based derivatives, and thus 
where counterparties would be harmed by entering into such transactions. Moreover, plaintiffs allege that their harm in the forum 
was not merely foreseeable, but that profiting from transactions in the forum was in part the motivation for defendants' 
manipulation. Thus, there is a far stronger case here for finding that the wrongful conduct was ""expressly aimed at the United 
States"" than there was in Waldman. In any event, plaintiffs need not establish personal jurisdiction under the ""effects test,"" - 
which is ""typically invoked where . . . the conduct that forms the basis for the controversy occurs entirely out-of-forum, and the 
only relevant jurisdictional contacts with the forum are therefore in-forum effects harmful to the plaintiff,"" Licci, 732 F.3d at 173 — 
because personal jurisdiction has been established under the ""purposeful availment"" test based on the alleged conduct in the 
forum. In Waldman, the jurisdictionally relevant conduct occurred entirely abroad, and thus specific jurisdiction could only be 
established under the ""effects test."" Here, the jurisdictionally relevant conduct is not simply the manipulation of CHF LIBOR 
abroad but the transacting in CHF LIBOR-based derivatives within the forum that was allegedly the purpose of the manipulation. "
1316,36," This conclusion does not conflict with the Court's conclusion that plaintiffs' RICO claims are impermissibly extraterritorial. The 
specific jurisdiction inquiry is satisfied if a defendant has purposefully availed himself of the forum such that he ""could foresee 
being haled into court there,"" Licci, 732 F.3d at 170. This is a less demanding inquiry than the RICO extraterritoriality analysis, 
which requires that the scheme have a domestic focus. See Petroleos Mexicanos, 572 F. App'x at 61. "
1322,1," Plaintiff named WestRock RKT Company as a defendant in the second amended complaint, but those parties stipulated to the 
dismissal of all of plaintiff's claims against WestRock RKT, which the court accepted on August 25, 2017, having heard no 
objection from any of the other defendants. (Dkt. #142.) "
1323,2," Defendant Georgia-Pacific LLC filed its own brief in support of its motion to dismiss the post-2010 conspiracy claims or, in the 
alternative, for judgment on the pleadings under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c). (Dkt. ##109-10.) The remaining 
defendants -- International Paper Company, WestRock CP, LLC and Packaging Corporation of America -- joined in the brief in 
support of the motion to dismiss filed by defendants Temple-Inland Inc., TIN Inc., Cascades USA, Inc., Cascades Canada ULC 
and Weyerhaeuser Company. Because the differences between the parties' briefs are immaterial for purposes of resolving their 
motions, the court will not address them separately."
1323,3," Plaintiff concedes that for purposes of defendants' motion, the conspiracy began no earlier than 2004. (Pl.'s Opp'n Br. (dkt. 
#130) at 16.) "
1324,4," Specifically, defendants Temple-Inland Inc., TIN Inc., Cascades USA, Inc., Cascades Canada ULC and Weyerhaeuser 
Company moved to dismiss plaintiff's § 133.14 claim, and defendants Packaging Corporation of America and WestRock CP, 
LLC joined in the portion of that motion challenging whether plaintiff alleges sufficient Wisconsin contacts as discussed below. "
1325,5," As cited by the district court in Western States, the pre-1980 amendments version of the illegal contracts and recovery 
provision provided that: All contracts or agreements made by any person while a member of any combination, conspiracy, trust or pool prohibited 
by s. 133.01 or 133.21, and which contract or agreement is founded upon, or is the result of, or grows out of, or is 
connected with, any violation of said sections, either directly or indirectly, shall be void and no recovery thereon or benefit 
therefrom shall be had by or for any such person. Any payments made upon, under or pursuant to such contract or 
agreement to or for the benefit of such person, may be recovered in an action by the party making any such payment, his 
heirs, personal representatives or assigns; provided that suit for such recovery is brought within 6 years after the making of 
said contract or agreement."
1325,619, F. Supp. 2d at 1070 (quoting Wis. Stat. § 133.23 (1976)). 
1326,6," There is a possibility that joint and several liability could provide the solution. See Paper Sys. Inc. v. Nippon Paper Indus. Co., 
281 F.3d 629, 632 (7th Cir. 2002); Segall v. Hurwitz, 114 Wis. 2d 471, 339 N.W.2d 333 (Wis. App. 1983). But see City of 
Madison v. Hyland, Hall & Co., 73 Wis. 2d 364, 243 N.W.2d 422 (Wis. 1976) (defendants may be held jointly liable for treble 
damages based on a bid-fixing conspiracy claim, but illegal contracts claim ""would only concern the individual liability of 
particular defendants to particular plaintiffs""). Of course, plaintiffs are not left without a remedy against co-conspirators with 
whom they formed no illegal contracts under Wisconsin law, as § 133.18 provides for recovery of treble damages for antitrust 
violations, but plaintiff does not plead a claim for damages under that provision. "
1327,7," Though decided before Olstad, the Wisconsin Supreme Court acknowledged in Meyers that the ""adverse effects"" standard 
applied in Emergency One was ""in essence, the test [it] adopted in Olstad."" 2007 WI 99 at ¶ 37, 303 Wis. 2d 295, 735 N.W.2d 
448. "
1328,8," At the very least, the court is satisfied that denying defendants' motion to dismiss under these circumstances presents little risk 
that endorsing ""lesser standards would jeopardize the action, undermine the validity of [Wisconsin's] antitrust statute, and create 
the spectacle of Lilliputian harassment in Wisconsin courts."" Olstad, 2005 WI 121 at ¶ 85, 284 Wis. 2d 224, 700 N.W.2d 139. "
1341,1," Although substantively identical, Defendants filed two separate ""Twombly"" memoranda in support of dismissing (1) Direct 
Purchaser Plaintiffs', Affiliated Foods', Kroger's, Meijer's, Publix's, Super Store Industries', SuperValu's, W. Lee Flowers', 
WalMart's, Wegmans', and Winn-Dixie's Complaints (ECF No. 408-1); and (2) End Payer Plaintiffs' and Commercial Food 
Preparer Plaintiffs' Complaints (ECF No. 409-1), respectively."
1341,2," Additionally, the Complaints primarily referenced in this Order are as follows: (1) DAP Kroger's Second Amended Complaint 
(""DAP Kroger's SAC,"" ECF No. 362); (2) Second Consolidated Direct Purchaser Class Compl. (""DPPs' SCCC,"" ECF No. 366); 
(3) Second Amended Consolidated Class Action Complaint of the Indirect Purchaser End Payer Plaintiffs (""EPPs' SACCAC,"" 
ECF No. 367); (4) Commercial Food Preparer Plaintiffs' Second Amended Complaint (""CFPs' SAC,"" ECF No. 361). Unless 
Defendants explicitly and clearly draw a distinction between various DAP Complaints, (e.g., DAP Kroger's Second Amended 
Complaint as compared to Direct Action Plaintiff Affiliated Foods Second Consolidated Amended Complaint (""DAP Affiliated 
Foods' SCAC,"" ECF No. 363), or a distinction necessarily arises from one of the Court's prior rulings, then the Court treats DAP 
Kroger's Second Amended Complaint as a valid exemplar of all DAPs' Complaints."
1341,3," This Order applies to the Motions to Dismiss filed in this matter (ECF Nos. 408, 409, 412) and to the identical Motions to 
Dismiss filed in related matters: 16-CV-247 (ECF Nos. 31, 34), 17-CV-951 (ECF Nos. 18, 21), 16-CV-398 (ECF Nos. 29, 33), 16-
CV-1226 (ECF Nos. 30, 34), and 17-CV-950 (ECF Nos. 18, 21). The Court also GRANTS Defendants Starkist Co., Dongwon 
Industries Co., Ltd., and Del Monte Co.'s Motion for Leave to File Exhibit on Case Docket. This Order applies to the Motion filed 
in this matter (ECF No. 413) and to: 16-CV-247 (ECF No. 35); 17-CV-951 (ECF No. 22); 16-CV-398 (ECF No. 34); 16-CV-1226 
(ECF No. 34); and 17-CV-950 (ECF No. 22). "
1342,4," Although not formally presented in Plaintiffs' Complaints, Mr. Hodge's guilty plea is properly the subject of judicial notice. 
Compare Fed. R. Evid. 201(b) (""The court may judicially notice a fact that is not subject to reasonable dispute because it . . . can 
be accurately and readily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.""), with DAPs' Opp'n Ex. 1 
(court transcript of proceeding during which the court accepted Mr. Hodge's guilty plea). "
1344,5," Defendants therefore have a point regarding the Flowers Complaint, in that the Court previously granted Defendants' requested 
relief as to that particular Plaintiff. However, Flowers' Amended Complaint is now replete with factual information firmly 
establishing a plausible conspiracy beginning as early as 2004. (See generally W. Lee Flowers & Co. Inc. v. Bumble Bee Foods 
LLC et al., 16cv1226-JLS (MDD), ECF No. 20 ¶¶ 1-162; see also infra Section II.A.i (finding to be plausible Plaintiffs' 2004 
allegations regarding Defendants Del Monte and StarKist).) And once a conspiracy is established ""it remains actionable until its 
purpose has been achieved or abandoned."" United States v. Inryco, Inc., 642 F.2d 290, 293 (9th Cir. 1981). For a defendant to 
abandon a conspiracy it must take affirmative action—""[p]assive nonparticipation in the continuing scheme is not enough to 
sever the meeting of minds that constitutes the conspiracy."" Smith v. United States, 568 U.S. 106, 112-13, 133 S. Ct. 714, 184 L. 
Ed. 2d 570 (2013). And here the Flowers Complaint easily passes the plausibility standard for the continuation of the alleged 
conspiracy, detailing, for example, several private meetings between Defendants at odd times and at undisclosed locations. (W. 
Lee Flowers & Co. Inc. v. Bumble Bee Foods LLC et al., 16cv1226-JLS (MDD), ECF No. 20 ¶ 163.) Accordingly, the Court 
DENIES Defendants' Motion to Dismiss on this front regarding the Flowers Complaint. "
1345,6," In DAPs' Opposition, Winn-Dixie concedes that it ""will not pursue its allegations of post-July 2015 conspiratorial conduct[,]"" 
(DAPs' Opp'n 41 n.43). Accordingly, Winn-Dixie SHALL file an amended complaint reflecting this concession within fourteen 
days of the date on which this Order is electronically docketed."
1345,7," Winn-Dixie is the sole outlier, acknowledging that it drafted its Complaint in such a way that it alleged a claim for injunctive 
relief, but now conceding that it ""will no longer pursue its claim for injunctive relief."" (DAPs' Opp'n 37.) Accordingly, the Court 
ORDERS that Winn-Dixie SHALL amend its Complaint to reflect this concession within fourteen days of the date on which this 
Order is electronically docketed. "
1346,8," This same paragraph in substance alleges violations of ""the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act"" (CFPs' SAC ¶ 205) and 
thus falls under a different Chapter of the South Carolina Code than South Carolina's Antitrust Act. (Compare S.C. Code. Ann. 
ch. 3 (""Trusts, Monopolies and Restraints of Trade""), with id. ch. 5 (""Unfair Trade Practices"").) "
1347,9," In addressing Defendants' prior Motions to Dismiss, Plaintiffs relied on Siegel v. Shell Oil Co. for the proposition that ""Laughlin, 
however, is silent as to the situation here: whether consumers can elect to pursue a remedy under the Consumer Fraud Act 
where the Illinois Antitrust Act may also provide relief."" 480 F. Supp. 2d 1034, 1048 (N.D. Ill. 2007). However, Plaintiffs here 
have not re-raised this argument and thus the Court instead takes Laughlin at face value for the proposition that Illinois's 
consumer protection statute ""is a statute directed against fraud and not one designed to be an additional antitrust enforcement 
mechanism . . . ."" Laughlin, 550 N.E.2d at 993. "
1349,10," Defendants also argue more generally that because the Cartwright Act is not a consumer protection statute there is an 
inherent conflict of laws in states that here only permit recovery under relevant consumer protection statutes or unjust 
enrichment law. (State Law Reply 3-4.) However, as the Court previously recognized, ""Plaintiffs are here seeking to certify a 
nationwide California class based on the same factual conduct underlying the alleged Sherman Act violations . . . ."" (Prior MTD 
Order II 21 (emphasis added).) And the mere fact that Plaintiffs may obtain redress under different state statutory regimes or 
common-law doctrines does not, by itself, create a material conflict that would necessarily ""make a difference in this litigation."" 
Mazza, 666 F.3d at 590."
1349,11," ""Plaintiffs no longer include [Illinois] in the Cartwright Class[,]"" (EPPs' & CFPs' Opp'n 5 n.5); accordingly, the Court ORDERS 
that Plaintiffs SHALL amend their Complaint to reflect this change in class definition within fourteen days of the date on which 
this Order is electronically docketed. "
1350,12," Although the Court previously determined that CFPs did not state a valid claim under Missouri law, CFPs do not now include 
Missouri within their Cartwright Act definition. (See CFPs' SAC ¶ 178(a)). "
1351,13," Defendants also note that one of EPPs' named plaintiffs for the Utah Class does not have statutory standing because he now 
lives in Ohio and therefore is not ""[a] person who is a citizen of [Utah] or a resident of [Utah]"" within the meaning of Utah Code § 
76-10-3109 (State Law Reply 16). However, because Defendants raised this argument in their Reply, EPPs have not had a 
chance to address this construction of the Utah statute; therefore the Court will not at this time dismiss that Plaintiff's claims with 
prejudice. See Schreiber Distrib. Co. v. Serv-Well Furniture Co., 806 F.2d 1393, 1401 (9th Cir. 1986) (""If a complaint is 
dismissed for failure to state a claim, leave to amend should be granted unless the court determines that the allegation of other 
facts consistent with the challenged pleading could not possibly cure the deficiency."" (citing Bonanno v. Thomas, 309 F.2d 320, 
322 (9th Cir. 1962))). "
1353,14," This necessarily MOOTS the StarKist Defendants' arguments that Plaintiffs do not allege Del Monte or StarKist reached an 
agreement with competitors to reduce can sizes (SK Defs.' MTD Mem. 16-18) and additionally compels the Court to DENY 
Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs' pre-2011 allegations as time-barred (id. at 18 (""Thus, to the extent the Court finds that 
Plaintiffs fail to plead that Del Monte, StarKist, and Dongwon were involved in pre-2011 conspiracy allegations, it should also 
dismiss these claims as time-barred."" (emphasis added))."
1353,15," The only two complaints which previously failed to validly alleged Dongwon's direct participation were those of the EPPs (Prior 
MTD Order II 11, n.3) and Flowers (Prior MTD Order I 22-24.) However, those Plaintiffs have now—at least in relevant part—
harmonized their amended complaints with the allegations the Court previously found to be sufficient to plausibly allege direct 
conspiracy. (See EPPs' SACCAC ¶¶ 129-45, 252-312; W. Lee Flowers & Co. Inc. v. Bumble Bee Foods LLC et al., 16-CV-1226-
JLS (MDD), ECF No. 20 ¶¶ 28-36, 148-163.) Accordingly, the Court concludes that both EPPs and Flowers have now plausibly 
alleged Defendant Dongwon's direct participation in the conspiracy from 2012 forward. (See Prior MTD Order I 12-22.) "
1354,16," Plaintiffs allege further material from 2009-2011 (e.g., DPPs' Opp'n 36-37); however, the Court need not consider these 
specific allegations since plausible 2008 allegations here establish forward-looking co-conspirator liability for the remainder of 
the conspiracy's alleged temporal scope."
1354,17," The DAP Kroger's Second Amended Complaint differs from the above allegations, but is nonetheless independently sufficient 
to plausibly allege Dongwon's 2008 participation in the conspiracy. Specifically, Kroger alleges that: ""In July 2008, Del Monte informed Dongwon that Bumble [**79]  Bee and the C[otS] Defendants were implementing the can 
downsizing, and gave Dongwon detailed information about each competitor's timetable for the can downsizing. Dongwon 
approved of the conspiratorial agreement and agreed to reduce the size of its cans intended for the United States to five 
ounces."" (DAP Kroger's SAC ¶ 124; see also id. ¶ 133 (""In October 2008, Dongwon's headquarters sought to ensure that 
all customers were being charged the increased prices, and Del Monte employees assured Dongwon that there were no 
exceptions."").)"
1354,18," EPPs' sole 2008 allegations are insufficiently conclusory regarding Dongwon's alleged participation in the conspiracy: i.e., only 
that ""Del Monte made a presentation to Dongwon . . . and . . . assured Dongwon that the new prices were being uniformly 
applied to StarKist customers."" (EPPs' Compl. ¶ 214.) "
1355,19," See Sonora Diamond Corp. v. Superior Court, 83 Cal. App. 4th 523, 539, 99 Cal. Rptr. 2d 824 (2000) (""Difficulty in enforcing a 
judgment or collecting a debt does not satisfy th[e] [alter-ego] standard."") "
1356,20," Plaintiffs also urge that because ""Dongwon functioned as a textbook chaebol,"" (e.g., DAPs' Opp'n 30-31)—i.e., a ""closely knit 
business group[ ] in South Korea under the control of a single family or extended family, with key 'flagship' firms which are used 
as the instruments of control of other firms within the group[,]"" In re Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) Antitrust Litig., No. 1917, 2016 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 102408, 2016 WL 7805628, at *22 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 3, 2016) (internal quotation marks omitted)—Plaintiffs' 
agency allegations are more plausible. However, the term chaebol is simply a culture-specific label for a business organization 
exhibiting certain characteristics. That some of those characteristics overlap with those required for a finding of a plausible 
agency relationship does not alter Plaintiffs' requirement to show specific facts plausibly suggesting the latter classification 
(which may of course, in turn, plausibly suggest the former classification is equally apt). "
1359,1," The parties dispute whether the Army's announcement occurred in April or May. Compare Def.'s Winogradow Decl. ¶¶ 15-16 
(stating April), with Pl.'s Thompson Decl. ¶ 44 (stating May). However, the precise date is not material. "
1360,2," A blank copy of the licensing form was attached to the 2014 Agreement. Id. at 12 (Schedule E, Licensing Fees). "
1363,3," Considering the hardship imposed on Duro by the non-compete clause in the 2012 Agreement, the court stated: ""Crye also 
asserts that Duro created its own hardship by rejecting Crye's 2014 Non-Exclusive License Agreement. But, that proposed 
agreement also contained a non-compete clause similar to § 3(h) in the 2012 License Agreement."" Duro I, 2016 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 54201, [WL] at *6."
1363,4," The Restatement (Second) of Judgments states that ""[p]reclusion ordinarily is proper if the question is one of the legal effect of 
a document identical in all relevant respects to another document whose effect was adjudicated in a prior action."" Restatement 
(Second) of Judgments § 27 cmt. c (1982). However, research does not reveal any instances of New York courts applying that 
rule to similar, but not identical, contract provisions. The Court declines to do so here. "
1364,5," Although federal preclusion principles apply to Crye's Lanham Act Claim, see Boguslavsky v. Kaplan, 159 F.3d 715, 720 n.4 
(2d Cir. 1998), the outcome is the same under both federal and state law of collateral estoppel. The only additional requirement 
imposed by federal preclusion law is that the resolution of the issue in the prior action was ""necessary to support a valid and final 
judgment on the merits."" Id. There is no question here that the Duro I court's conclusion on the issue of likelihood of confusion 
met that requirement. "
1370,1," Wells Fargo's exhibits include: the Wells Fargo loan agreement and notes; the Dickson, Blount, and Davidson County deeds of 
trust; the Florida mortgage; the security agreement, swap agreement, and swap confirmation; the March 15, 2011 default letter; 
Providence Hall's sale motions and the related orders; Providence Hall's and Dickson's proof of claims, the court's order 
approving the Chapter 11 trustee; the Dickson designee order; the sanctions order and opinion against Providence Hall's (now 
Dickson's) counsel; the Dickson motion to dismiss and dismissal order; the Providence Hall litigation complaint; and the 
schedule to the master agreement. Dickson's exhibits include: a copy of the Dickson designee order; the Providence Hall 
dismissal order; and Dickson's creditors list. "
1372,2," Dickson also argues that it is too early in the litigation for the court to resolve the question of privity. (Pl.'s Opp'n 13.) The court 
disagrees. In the cases Dickson relies upon, the courts based their concerns as to timing on the fact that the initial round of 
litigation was not yet complete. See Johnson & Johnson v. Coopervisions, Inc., 720 F. Supp. 1116 (D. Del 1989); Fluke 
Elecs.Corp. v. CorDEX Instruments, Inc., No. C12-2082JLR, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 80628, 2013 WL 2468846 (W.D. Wash. 
June 7, 2013). Here, the initial litigation is complete."
1372,3," Because the court agrees that res judicata applies in this case, it does not reach Wells Fargo's arguments regarding judicial 
estoppel, waiver, or the anti-tying statute of limitations. These three arguments may well present alternate grounds on which 
Dickson's claims could properly be dismissed."
1372,4," Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9001(5) permits a bankruptcy court to appoint a person to perform acts required by the bankruptcy rules 
when a debtor is not a natural person. This person is often referred to as the debtor's ""designee."" See In re Red River Energy, 
Inc., 409 B.R. 163 (Bankr. S.D. Tex. 2009). "
1373,5," Dickson appeared to argue in its briefing and during the hearing that Dickson must have ""controlled"" the prior action for the sale 
orders to have preclusive effect. (See Pl.'s Opp'n 9, 12-13.) Control is not a requirement of res judicata, see Taylor v. Sturgell, 
553 U.S. 880, 894-95, 128 S. Ct. 2161, 171 L. Ed. 2d 155 (2008), though it may be an example of one of the ""limited 
circumstances [where a nonparty] has his interests adequately represented by someone with the same interests who is a party,"" 
Richards, 517 U.S. at 798-99. "
1385,1," Producers also argued in the original motion that the report should be stricken because Buyers did not formally seek or receive 
leave of Court to file the report. The parties originally intended that Buyers would file a motion for leave to submit an expert 
rebuttal report so the Court could address the propriety of that report on the front end of Plaintiffs' reply brief. (See Doc. 241). 
That plan fell by the wayside, however, due to an unfortunate misunderstanding between the Court's law clerk and Plaintiffs' 
counsel. The Court, after discussions with counsel, decided to instead address the propriety of the rebuttal report through 
Producers' Motion to Strike (Doc. 262) and Buyers' response to that motion (Doc. 272). Despite this agreement, during the 
recent hearing Producers renewed their argument that the rebuttal testimony should be stricken for failing to formally receive 
leave of court. Producers allege that additional language not included in the Court's order is applicable—specifically, language in 
the Stipulated [Proposed] Order requiring not only that Plaintiff's received leave of court to file the document, but also that ""good 
cause"" be shown for inclusion of the report. (Doc. 262-1, p. 3). Assuming such language is in fact applicable, despite being 
absent from the final order, Producers make no argument as to why good cause is not shown here. Given that the parties and 
Magistrate Judge Williams clearly anticipated the filing of a rebuttal expert's report, and no reason for the exclusion of the report 
has been proffered other than a technical violation, the Court finds good cause existed for inclusion of the rebuttal report. "
1388,2," Edwards involved the same Producers as the current action, but the claim was raised under state antitrust law. Edwards, 
2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 130621, 2014 WL 4643639, at *6. "
1389,3," In their earlier Motion to Dismiss, Producers argued KPH lacked standing because its assignments were invalid and the only 
purchases KPH made directly were from an unnamed party (Upstate Niagara) that resold cheese and butter made by others. 
(Doc. 249, p. 20). This Court found, however, that KPH purchased butter and/or cheese from Defendant Agri-Mark and that the 
assigned claims were all from purchasers who had also bought butter and cheese from Agri-Mark. (Doc. 250, p. 9). As a result, 
the Court held KPH had standing to sue. (Doc. 250, p. 9). Producers again raise this issue in their supplemental brief, clothed in 
the language of typicality. (Doc. 290, p. 11). The Court declines the invitation to revisit this issue and reminds Producers the 
correct method for requesting reconsideration of a prior ruling is to file a motion pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60. "
1390,4," During oral argument Producers also attempt to re-litigate the question of whether KPH was properly assigned claims. 
Specifically, Producers argued that consideration is needed for a valid assignment. (Doc. 288, 27:4-6). The case cited by 
Producers, Bailey v. Prudence Mutual Casualty Co., 429 F.2d 1388 (7th Cir. 1970), however, is inapposite. In that case, the 
Court simply found a valid assignment existed because there was consideration. Id. at 1389. Nowhere in the decision does the 
Court state that consideration is necessary for there to be a proper assignment. Thus, the Court finds no basis for reversing its 
earlier determination that KPH qualifies as a direct purchaser."
1390,5," HN10[
] Proposed counsel also must demonstrate their ability to litigate the case vigorously and competently on behalf of the named and absent class members. Riordan v. Smith Barney, 113 F.R.D. 60, 64 (N.D. Ill. 1986). The Court has no doubt that 
Buyers' counsel is competent, and Producers do not suggest otherwise. "
1391,6," The Court declines to apply this case to the earlier typicality analysis. In Deiter, proof of a central element of the claim, that 
defendant overcharged Deiter due to a monopoly, did not necessarily prove that the excluded class members were also 
overcharged. Deiter, 436 F.3d at 468. Conversely here, any differences between various retailers of butter and cheese do not 
impact any of the claims or defenses raised because the question is whether the Herd Retirement Program was implemented for 
the express purpose of increasing raw milk, cheese, and butter prices in violation of federal antitrust laws. Plaintiffs have the 
same interest in proving that violation as other retail buyers of the products, regardless of differences in the amount each paid. "
1392,7," HN13[
] The ""quick look"" standard falls somewhere between the per se and Rule of Reason methodologies. This middle 
standard is applied when the defendant's conduct—while not per se illegal—appears likely to have anticompetitive effects, such 
as higher prices or reduced output. Id. Where the plaintiff shows a horizontal agreement to fix prices exists, anticompetitive 
effect is established without requiring additional evidence. Agnew v. NCAA, 683 F.3d 328, 337 (7th Cir. 2012) (citing Law v. 
NCAA, 134 F.3d 1010, 1020 (10th Cir. 1998)). Instead, the burden shifts to the defendant to produce a plausible procompetitive 
justification for the behavior. Id. If no legitimate justification is found, the Seventh Circuit has held that no further market power 
analysis is necessary, and the practice is condemned. Id. at 336. But if justifications are found, a full Rule of Reason analysis 
may be required. The Court notes the quick-look approach is often used when a restraint would normally be considered illegal 
per se, but ""a certain degree of cooperation is necessary if the [product at issue] is to be preserved."" Bd. of Regents, 468 U.S. at 
117. Here, the Court considers it unlikely the parties could prove cooperation in milk production is necessary to preserve the 
product. Additionally, neither party has argued this standard is applicable. Thus, the Court finds it unnecessary to perform an 
analysis under the quick-look standard. "
1393,8," HN15[
] Plaintiffs are still required to show ""the conspiracy caused them an injury"" in order to recover damages, but this is a separate inquiry from whether there was a Sherman Act violation. Atl. Richfield, 495 U.S. at 341, 344. "
1395,9," The only case relied on by Producers for their argument is a California district court case where the court found a correlation 
analysis was insufficient to show class wide impact. In re GPUs, 253 F.R.D. at 493-94. Dr. Brown did not, however, produce a 
correlation analysis; rather he completed a regression analysis. (Doc. 245, p. 33). Producers do not explain how the finding In re 
GPUs about the inadequacy of a correlation analysis proves Dr. Brown's regression analysis is insufficient evidence of common 
impact."
1395,10," In their supplemental brief, Producers also argue the methodology used by Buyers runs afoul of the filed-rate doctrine. (Doc. 
290, p. 7). This issue was already raised by Producers and ruled on by this Court. Specifically, the Court earlier determined the 
filed-rate doctrine was not applicable. (Doc. 250, p. 20). Producers focus on other language in the Order that ""[t]his conclusion is 
bolstered by Plaintiffs' claim that their damages can be determined without requiring the Court to recalculate the federally 
regulated minimum."" (Doc. 250, p. 20). For some reason, Producers read this language to suggest the Court's Order means 
Buyers can only recover if they are able to prove their case without requiring the Court to recalculate the regulated minimum milk 
prices. (Doc. 290, p. 8). Producers argue Buyers cannot do so, but provide no evidence in support of that claim. The Court 
declines to revisit its earlier decision based on Producers' misrepresentation of its earlier order and broad unsupported 
conclusions. "
1396,11," Producers also raise an argument that Buyers' reliance on Dr. Brown's analysis is contrary to Comcast v. Behrend. (Doc. 249, 
p. 28). HN23[
] In Comcast v. Behrend, the Supreme Court held that evidence of damages in a class action must measure only those damages attributable to plaintiff's theory of liability. 569 U.S. 27, 133 S.Ct. 1426, 1433, 185 L. Ed. 2d 515 (2013). In 
Comcast, the plaintiff's expert calculated damages based on all four theories of antitrust liability advanced by the plaintiffs. 
Comcast, 133 S.Ct. at 1434. The Supreme Court stated that such a methodology might have been sound if all four theories of 
antitrust impact remained in the case. Id. Because only one such antitrust theory remained by the time of trial, however, the 
experts' calculations were not limited to the single legal theory upon which liability was premised. Id. Producers argue Buyers 
model similarly fails because it ""does not measure increases to prices not caused by changes in the regulated prices of raw 
milk."" (Doc. 249, p. 29). This is not the issue raised by Comcast. Producers are arguing that Dr. Brown's method is inaccurate, 
not that it measures damages on a theory of liability that is not before the court. Because Buyers have put forward a model that 
measures damages based on the Herd Retirement Program, and that is the only theory of liability they have alleged, they have 
met their burden for purposes of class certification. "
1397,12," Because the Court finds that certification of Buyers' proposed classes is proper under 23(b), the Court need not address 
Buyers' alternative basis for certification under Rule 23(c)(4). "
1403,1," Although the Opposition brief itself is 25 pages long, it incorporates by reference a 26-page ""Table of Facts"" that regurgitates 
the FAC and makes legal conclusions, and includes a four-page list of ""Noteworthy Cases."" "
1404,2," See, e.g., McHenry, 84 F.3d at 1177-80 (affirming trial court's dismissal with prejudice of a complaint that was ""argumentative, 
prolix, replete with redundancy, and largely irrelevant"" and consisted ""largely of immaterial background infor-mation""); Nevijel v. 
North Coast Life Ins. Co., 651 F.2d 671, 673-4 (9th Cir. 1981) (affirming trial court's dismissal with prejudice of a complaint that 
was ""verbose, confusing and almost entirely conclusory"" and consisted of ""48 pages with 14 pages of addenda and 9 pages of 
exhibits."") "
1407,3," Defendants attached a copy of the investment advisory services contract to their Motion. Because this document is one whose 
contents are alleged in the FAC, the Court may consider its contexts in evaluating Defendants' 12(b)(6) motion. Branch, 14 F.3d 
at 454. "
1411,1," The following facts are taken from the First Amended Complaint (Doc. No. 37 (""FAC"")) and are accepted as true for the 
purpose of deciding this motion. The Court has also considered Defendants' memoranda in support of dismissal (Doc. Nos. 52, 
55, 57), Plaintiff's opposition (Doc. No. 63 (""Opp'n"")), and Defendants' reply memoranda (Doc. Nos. 65-67)."
1411,2," The First Amended Complaint rarely distinguishes between the acts of each Defendant, and frequently refers to all four 
Defendants simply as ""Defendants,"" or to the Roche Group as ""Roche."" (See, e.g., FAC ¶ 4 n.1, 9, 11, 13.) "
1412,3," Although Defendant Genentech, Inc.'s brief makes reference to Plaintiff's constitutional standing, its arguments and analysis 
reflect that it is only challenging Plaintiff's antitrust standing."
1412,4," The Court does not reach Defendants' arguments that Plaintiff failed to state a claim for each of its causes of action, that 
Plaintiff R-Pharm was not properly served, that the Court lacks personal jurisdiction over R-Pharm, and that the case should be 
dismissed under the doctrine of forum non conveniens. The Court notes that it may dismiss a complaint without addressing 
personal jurisdiction in cases ""with multiple defendants — over some of whom the court indisputably has personal jurisdiction — 
in which all defendants collectively challenge the legal sufficiency"" of the complaint. Chevron Corp. v. Naranjo, 667 F.3d 232, 
246 n.17 (2d Cir. 2012). "
1413,5," To the extend the FAC can be read to allege injuries in Russia, those injuries do not give rise to an antitrust injury for the 
reasons set forth in Part B of this opinion. See, e.g., In re Intel Microprocessor Litig. 452 F. Supp. 2d. 555, 557 (D. Del. 2006) 
(dismissing complaint for lack of antitrust standing when it alleged ""foreign injuries that occurred in foreign markets"" that were 
""not the type of injury that Congress intended to prevent through the [FTAIA] or the Sherman Act""); de Atucha v. Commodity 
Exch., Inc., 608 F. Supp. 510, 518 (S.D.N.Y. 1985) (""Congress did not contemplate recovery under the antitrust laws by an 
individual who traded, and was injured entirely outside of United States commerce."") "
1417,6," The First Amended Complaint alleges that Defendants packaged Herceptin ""worldwide"" in a manner that misrepresents how 
much patients need to buy or use (FAC P 216), but not that those misrepresentations affected Plaintiff's sales of its biosimilars in 
the United States, since Plaintiff does not sell drugs in the United States. The First Amended Complaint also alleges that 
Defendants reduced the number of wholesalers it uses for the Drugs in order to limit the availability of samples necessary for its 
rivals to obtain FDA approval for competitive drugs, but as noted above, Plaintiff does not allege that it has begun — or even 
contemplated — clinical trials that require those samples or otherwise attempted to obtain such samples from Defendants. (See 
id. ¶¶ 181-91.) "
1418,7," (See Opp'n at 22 (""the relevant inquiry is not the domestic effects exception, but the import exception"") (quoting Maricultura, 
159 F. Supp. 3d at 382).) "
1420,8," Closing this action will not affect Defendants' motion for sanctions (Doc. No. 71), which is still pending before the Court. See 
Covanta Onondaga Ltd. P 'ship v. Onondaga County Res. Recovery Agency, 318 F.3d 392, 396 (2d Cir. 2003) (""[A] court that 
has concluded its adjudication of the merits of a case within its jurisdiction by entering a final judgment retains authority to take 
action with respect to some collateral matters related to the case, such as attorney's fees and costs.""). "
1426,1," Both Illinois and California require the use of EVR for registering and titling all cars sold instate; Illinois additionally requires that 
printed registration and license plates be provided at the time of sale. FAC ¶¶ 60, 66. MVSC asserts that in Illinois, CVR has 
approximately 95 percent of the EVR market; in California, CVR controls approximately 40 percent, MVSC approximately 50 
percent, and another competitor, Dealertrack, the remaining 10 percent of the EVR market. Id. ¶¶ 61, 80."
1426,2, States regulate EVR providers within their boundaries; each state is thus a separate EVR market. Id. ¶ 49.
1426,3," There is no objection to the Court considering the two documents (CDK's published price list and a data security publication) 
referenced in the FAC. See CDK Request for Judicial Notice, Dkt. 62. CDK contends that the $49 packages advertised in its 
published price list do not include the data EVR providers like MVSC require (vehicle information, buyer information, and 
financing information). While it is true that the price list does not mention ""EVR,"" it is not implausible that the ""Dealer Website"" 
package contains the data EVR providers require. See Starr v. Baca, 652 F.3d 1202, 1216 (9th Cir. 2011). "
1427,4," Contrary to Plaintiff's assertion, the order in Authenticom, Inc. v. CDK Global LLC, No. 17-cv-00318, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
109409, 2017 WL 3017048 (W.D. Wis. July 14, 2017) granting that plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction is not ""dispositive 
here."" "
1429,5," MVSC also asserts that blocking MVSC's ability to obtain DMS data forces EVR consumers to use CVR—which MVSC alleges 
is more costly than (and inferior to) MVSC's EVR product. See VeriSign, 611 F.3d at 502-03 (""CFIT has also alleged that 
consumers are harmed by this anti-competitive restraint, in the form of higher prices for registration of domain names, and 
potentially lower-quality services. In combination with the allegations regarding the existence of the conspiracy between VeriSign 
and ICANN as well as the intent to restrain competition, these allegations of harm to competition are sufficient to state a claim 
under Section 1."")."
1429,6," CDK and Reynolds argue that MVSC lacks standing to allege an antitrust violation in the ""data integration"" market because 
MVSC does not compete in that market. MVSC has alleged, however, that it is a direct consumer of data integrators' product. 
See Freeman v. San Diego Ass'n of Realtors, 322 F.3d 1133, 1154 (9th Cir. 2003), as amended on denial of reh'g (Apr. 24, 
2003) (""If the associations exclude competitors, [plaintiff] suffers inflated prices, and she has standing to sue [under the Sherman 
Act] as an aggrieved consumer.""). "
1430,7," MVSC asserts that it is a direct consumer of ""data integrators,"" but its Section 2 claims are directed solely at the EVR markets 
in Illinois and California."
1430,8," Therefore, the Court need not address whether MVSC adequately stated unilateral refusal to deal claims against CDK and 
Reynolds. "
1431,9," See also Freeman, 322 F.3d at 1148 (""[T]he single-entity rule [announced in Copperweldl is relevant in a variety of contexts ....

equally applicable to allegations of conspiracy under Section 2 of the Sherman Act)."
1431,10," MVSC claims that there is ""no inconsistency between the argument that CDK and Reynolds are liable for monopolization as 
owners of the CVR joint venture, and the argument under American Needle that Reynolds, CDK, and CVR are distinct entities 
for purposes of allegations of unlawful conspiracy."" Opp'n at 30. The Court need not address that issue at this time. "
1434,1," The branch of CPC that originally entered into the JV was a Texas corporation, but it merged into a newly created Delaware 
corporation of the same name in 1996. Dkt. 1-7. For ease of reference, the court will refer to the Texas corporation as ""CPC-
Texas"" and the Delaware corporation as ""CPC-Delaware"" when it is necessary to distinguish between the two entities."
1434,2," Ukrnafta filed a motion to remand on April 27, 2009. Dkt. 15. The motion, however, was filed stricken because it was filed while 
the case was stayed pending a decision from the Swedish arbitration tribunal. Dkt. 17. Ukrnafta never filed another motion to 
remand."
1434,3," CPC did not get the consent of the other defendants before removing because the other defendants had not been served. 
Dkt.1. Bensch and Taurex Resources PLC were both served on April 2, 2009. Dkts. 7, 8. Kuwait Energy Company has not been 
served. "
1442,4," The Karaha Bodas Co. case has been in front of the Fifth Circuit twice. See Karaha Bodas Co., 264 F. Supp. 2d 470 (S.D. Tex. 
2002) (Atlas, J.), rev'd by 335 F.3d 357 (5th Cir. 2003); and Karaha Bodas Co. (Karaha II), 364 F.3d 274 (5th Cir. 2004) (cert. 
denied). A related case was later heard by the Second Circuit. Karaha Bodas Co., L.L.C. v. Perusahaan Pertambangan Minyak 
Dan Gas Bumi Negara (Karaha III), 500 F.3d 111 (2nd Cir. 2007). Karaha Bodas filed this related case in New York to enforce 
the Texas district court's judgment because Perusahaan Pertambangan Minyak Dan Gas Bumi Negara (""Perusahaan"") had 
several bank accounts in New York. Id. at 116. While the New York litigation was proceeding, Perusahaan filed a lawsuit in the 
Cayman Islands to vitiate the foreign arbitral award, claiming that the award was procured by fraud. Id. at 117. Karaha Bodas 
moved for an injunction prohibiting Perusahaan from maintaining the lawsuit in the Cayman Islands. Id. at 118. The New York 
district court entered a permanent injunction, and Perusahaan appealed. Id. The Second Circuit ultimately held that ""the Cayman 
Islands has no arguable basis for jurisdiction to adjudicate rights and obligations of the parties with respect to the Award."" Id. at 
125. The Second Circuit affirmed the New York district court's order granting the injunction with slight modifications. Id. at 130. "
1448,5," The multi-factor balancing test to determine if a court should abstain on international comity grounds includes the following 
factors: ""(1) Degree of conflict with foreign law or policy; (2) Nationality of the parties, locations or principal places of business of 
corporations; (3) Relative importance of the alleged violation of conduct here as compared with conduct abroad; (4) The extent 
to which enforcement by either state can be expected to achieve compliance, the availability of a remedy abroad and the 
pendency of litigation there; (5) Existence of intent to harm or affect American commerce and foreseeability; (6) Possible effect 
upon foreign relations if the court exercises jurisdiction and grants relief; (7) If relief is granted, whether a party will be placed in "
1449,," the position of being forced to perform an act illegal in either country or be under conflicting requirements by both countries; (8) 
Whether the court can make its order effective; (9) Whether an order for relief would be acceptable in this country if made by the 
foreign nation under similar circumstances; and (10) Whether a treaty with the affected nations has addressed the issue."" In re 
Vitamin C Antitrust Litig., 837 F.3d at 184-85 (citing Mannington Mills, Inc. v. Congoleum Corp., 595 F.2d 1287, 1297-98 (3d Cir. 
1979)). The parties do not analyze these factors in their briefing in this case. "

and the expert testimony of the five experts in this case: Plaintiffs' Memorandum of Law in Support of Motion to Exclude 
Opinions Offered by Dr. Joseph Kalt (""Kalt Daubert Mot."") [Dkt. 774-1]; exhibits 1 through 15 submitted in support of plaintiffs' 
motion to exclude Dr. Kalt; Defendants' Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Plaintiffs' Motion to Exclude Opinions Offered by 
Dr. Joseph Kalt (""Kalt Daubert Opp."") [Dkt. 777]; and exhibits 1 through 27 submitted in support of defendants' opposition to 
plaintiffs' motion to exclude Dr. Kalt. The Court also reviewed all of the expert reports in support of and in opposition to class 
certification. Motions Hearing and Related Submissions. The Court also reviewed the transcripts of the motions hearing of September 26-30, 
2016, and the binders of materials, consisting of demonstratives, exhibits, and expert reports and deposition excerpts, submitted 
by the parties at the hearing. The Court also reviewed all of the exhibits admitted into evidence at the 2016 hearing and will refer 
to the direct purchaser plaintiffs' exhibits as ""Pls. Ex."" and to defendants' exhibits as ""Defs. Ex."" The hearing transcripts will be 
cited by date and page. As directed by the court of appeals, see In re Rail Freight Fuel Surcharge Antitrust Litig.—MDL No. 1869, 725 F.3d at 255, the 
record before the Court at the time of the initial class certification has also been considered. See Rail Freight III, 287 F.R.D. at 
10 n.1. "
1480,2," The Court also heard argument regarding whether plaintiffs could substitute Dr. Rausser with an entirely new expert and set 
aside all prior briefing in this case as opposed to retaining a supplemental expert to review Dr. Rausser's work. See generally 
Status Conference Tr. (Nov. 13, 2014) [Dkt. 754]. The Court concluded that ""starting over would be extremely prejudicial to 
defendants, particularly given the considerable length and cost of the class certification proceedings to date."" In re Rail Freight 
Fuel Surcharge Antitrust Litig., 75 F. Supp. 3d at 101. "
1481,3," Cascade and Dr. Rausser often referred to this case as the ""Rail"" case or the ""Rails"" case. See In re Rail Freight Fuel 
Surcharge Antitrust Litig., 75 F. Supp. 3d at 96; Class Certification Hr'g Tr. (Sept. 28, 2016) at 534. "
1482,4," Dr. Rausser is also the direct purchaser plaintiffs' expert in In re Processed Egg Products Antitrust Litigation. 81 F. Supp. 3d 
412. Judge Pratter briefly discussed Dr. Rausser's credibility in her opinion denying the defendants' motion to exclude Dr. 
Rausser in that case. Id. at 417-18. "
1485,5," At the class certification hearing, defendants objected to this line of testimony because, they assert, Dr. Rausser's testimony is 
based on interline-related communications between the defendant railroads and therefore are protected by statute. See Class 
Certification Hr'g Tr. (Sept. 27, 2016) at 350; see generally 49 U.S.C. § 10706. The Court has not yet decided whether the 
communications in these documents are in fact protected under Section 10706. See Rail Freight III, 287 F.R.D. at 19-20. The 
Court need not reach this issue now because it can resolve the issue of whether to certify the class without relying on any of 
these documents. The Court therefore will not rule on defendants' motion to exclude interline-related communications [Dkt. 417] 
at this time. "
1486,6," ""Elasticity"" measures the sensitivity of one variable to change in a second variable, and it is expressed as a ratio between the 
percent change in the first variable and the percent change in the second variable. See Leitzinger Rep. ¶ 109; Carlton Rep. ¶ 6 
n.7. As used here, the term ""inelastic"" refers to a common application known as ""elasticity of demand,"" which describes the 
relationship between the price of a good and the quantity of the good demanded as the percentage change in quantity 
demanded in response to a change in price."" Rausser Merits Rep. at 24 n.25 (citing RICHARD A. POSNER, ANTITRUST LAW 11-12 
(2d ed. 2001)). "
1487,7," There are a number of statements in Part V of Dr. Rausser's Merits Report that are impermissible statements about what 
conduct in fact occurred or which touch upon the ultimate issue of whether there was collusion. Because the Court is the fact-
finder at the class certification stage, it need not excise or strike specific portions of Dr. Rausser's report or statements contained 
within in it. See In re Rail Freight Fuel Surcharge Antitrust Litig., 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 66526, 2016 WL 2962186, at *1-2 
(quoting In re Salem, 465 F.3d 767, 777 (7th Cir. 2006)). It can separate the admissible from the inadmissible in deciding 
whether to certify the proposed class. "
1490,8," In previous iterations of his damages model, when Dr. Rausser did not have the STB data, he calculated a fuel elasticity of 
0.024 and 0.032. See Pls. Supp. Reply at 12. For the purposes of calculating damages, the higher the fuel elasticity coefficient, 
the lower the amount of damages. Class Certification Hr'g Tr. (Sept. 26, 2016) at 97. In other words, Dr. Rausser initially 
calculated a larger amount of damages than he now does."
1490,9," In earlier expert reports, Dr. Rausser has reported that his damages model incorporates a total of approximately 15 million 
transactions, ""approximately 8.6 million transactions from the benchmark period and 5.7 million transactions from the Class 
Period."" Rausser Supp. Reply at 23."
1490,10," An ""overcharge"" refers to the percentage increase in freight rates that putative class members suffered as a result of 
defendants' alleged conduct. See Rausser Merits Rep. at 169; see also IIA PHILLIP E. AREEDA ET AL., ANTITRUST LAW: AN ANALYSIS OF ANTITRUST PRINCIPLES AND THEIR APPLICATION 1395 (4th ed. 2015). "
1492,11," The Court notes that it is more accurate to describe this as a dispute involving legacy shipments, not legacy shippers, because 
""some of the shippers are the same shippers that [are] in the class because they entered into new contracts during the class 
period."" Class Certification Hr'g Tr. (Sept. 26, 2016) at 200. "
1493,12," This 2.9% figure is derived from the NS data. Kalt Class Rep. ¶ 115. Dr. Kalt took this 2.9% waiver rate from Dr. Rausser's 
work. See Rausser Merits Reply, Table 80. Neither expert calculated the rate at which the other defendants waived fuel 
surcharges during the pre-class period. "
1494,13," Dr. Rausser notes that when examining legacy contracts, as opposed to legacy shipments, ""90 percent of Legacy Contracts 
updated their FSCs or used FSCs that were implemented during the Class and/or Conspiracy Periods."" Pls. Ex. 1 at 16; see also 
Rausser Supp. Rep., Table 31. Specifically, (1) 45.21% of the legacy contracts had ""self-adjusting fuel surcharges"" (""Category 
1""); (2) 32.69% of legacy contracts applied a fuel surcharge formula that did not exist before the conspiracy period (""Category 
2""); (3) 11.95% of legacy contracts were entered into during the formation of the conspiracy, March 1 through July 1, 2003; and 
(4) 0.34% of the legacy contracts were entered into during the class period. Id.; see also Pls. Ex. 1 at 16. "
1495,14," Defendants have never filed the complete version of Dr. Kalt's 384-page Merits Report with this Court, only exhibit 12 to their 
post-remand opposition to plaintiffs' motion for class certification, which contains 66 pages of excerpts from that report. See OD 
Ex. 12. Several of the 66 pages include truncated paragraphs, which makes it impossible for the Court to fully review even those 
portions of the Kalt Merits Report contained in exhibit 12. See, e.g., id. at 77, 90, 137. Presumably, the full Kalt Merits Report "
1496,," would be made available to the fact-finder if there were a trial. Where it is not possible for the Court to review the portions of Dr. 
Kalt's merits report that defendants cite, the Court has instead relied on Dr. Kalt's Class Report, his Sur-Reply Report, and his 
testimony at the class certification hearing. "
1497,15, Dr. Kalt did not perform any similar coverage exercises for the other defendants. 
1498,16," Dr. Kalt offers one additional argument that sounds in the language of a false positive, but he does not label it as such. Dr. Kalt 
found that ""38% of shipments, accounting for $15 billion (35% of Class revenue), have implausibly high"" overcharges that 
exceed the fuel surcharge on the shipment. Kalt Class Sur-Reply ¶ 63 & Figure SR-11. Dr. Kalt argues that these results — that 
Dr. Rausser's damages model calculates overcharges for given shipments in excess of the fuel surcharge on those shipments 
— are a false positive because plaintiffs' theory of liability is grounded only in supra-competitive fuel surcharge rates. Id. ¶ 63. 
Plaintiffs do not dispute this piece of Dr. Kalt's expert opinion under Daubert, but the Court will assess the argument for purposes 
of Rule 23(b)(3). See infra at 164-65."
1498,17," Dr. Rausser's damages model uses a constant fuel elasticity coefficient in order to calculate a single average weekly 
overcharge that is an estimate of class-wide injury. Dr. Kalt argues that using a log-log model to calculate a constant elasticity is 
inappropriate, but acknowledges that using a log-log model to calculate antitrust damages — the second step of the damages 
model — is a standard econometric practice. See Class Certification Hr'g Tr. (Sept 29, 2016) at 858."
1498,18," In their Daubert motion, plaintiffs also challenge Dr. Kalt's work ""re-specifying"" Dr. Rausser's model to incorporate a variable 
fuel coefficient, as opposed to Dr. Rausser's constant fuel coefficient. Kalt Daubert Mot. at 24. Plaintiffs attempted to challenge 
this piece of Dr. Kalt's work again at the class certification hearing, which Dr. Kalt never submitted to the Court, but was included 
in his work papers. Class Certification Hr'g Tr. (Sept. 29, 2016) at 922. Defendants argued at the class certification hearing that 
Dr. Kalt was ""not sponsoring"" these work papers, and therefore that Dr. Kalt made no assertion that he could run Dr. Rausser's 
damages model using a variable fuel coefficient. Class Certification Hr'g Tr. (Sept. 26, 2016) at 89; see also Class Certification "
1499,," Hr'g Tr. (Sept. 27, 2016) at 391-92. As there is no expert opinion to exclude, the Court rejects plaintiffs' arguments with respect 
to this issue."
1499,19," In addition to critiquing Dr. Rausser's use of a constant fuel coefficient, Dr. Kalt engaged in a separate exercise: he assumed 
that a constant fuel coefficient was appropriate and then ran Dr. Rausser's model without the problematic STB intermodal data, 
Kalt Class Rep. ¶ 59. Dr. Kalt calculated an elasticity of 0.222 — more than double Dr. Rausser's 0.103 - which resulted in an 
average weekly overcharge of 4.0%, less than half of Dr. Rausser's 9.8%. Id. ¶¶ 59-60."
1499,20," A translog model is ""used in econometrics because [it] allows analysts to model complex features of the production function, 
such as elasticities of substitution, which are functions of the second derivatives of product, cost, or utility functions. The linear 
model restricts these to equal zero. . . ."" WILLIAM H. GREENE, ECONOMETRIC ANALYSIS 58 (7th ed. 2012). Unlike a linear log-log 
model, it does not demand homogeneity in how it describes the variables in the regression model. Id. at 353. ""For the translog 
cost function, the elasticities of substitution . . . will differ at every data point. It is common to compute them at some central point 
such as the means of the data."" Id. "
1501,21," Plaintiffs do not explain these terms. Nonetheless, the Court understands that ""pricing above cost"" refers to a strategy where a 
railroad would take its variable costs, add a certain profit margin, and then set its price at that level. The Court also understands 
that ""pricing to market"" refers to a strategy where a railroad would take its variable costs and look to the prices set by its 
competitors as a means of setting as high a price as the market will bear. "
1503,22," The Court is aware that a ""plausible"" theory of common proof is no longer sufficient to satisfy the Rule 23(b)(3) predominance 
requirement for class certification after Comcast. See In re Rail Freight Fuel Surcharge Antitrust Litig. — MDL No. 1869, 725 
F.3d at 255; see also infra at 107-08. The Court uses the term here for Daubert and not Rule 23(b)(3) purposes, namely to 
explain that an expert witness — faced with an accusation that he excluded data or his results contain a negative sign must 
provide a plausible response in order for his or her expert opinion to be considered reliable under Daubert and Rule 702."
1503,23," The Court understands that fuel cost recovery refers to a defendant's ability to raise prices in response to increases in fuel 
prices, thereby recovering any profit margin that would have otherwise been lost to the increase in costs. This is accomplished 
by passing through the increased fuel costs to the shippers by raising the all-in rate through mechanisms such as a fuel 
surcharge. "
1504,24," Judge Cote uses the term ""false positive"" here in the same way this Court uses the term ""uninjured class members"" in this 
Opinion. "
1506,25," As noted, the Court has excluded under Daubert several of Dr. Rausser's opinions that crossed the line from a statement that 
""defendants conduct is consistent with collusion"" to ""defendants colluded."" See supra at 34-35, 37-38. Dr. Leitzinger restates 
some of Dr. Rausser's conclusions regarding defendants' actions. Leitzinger Rep. ¶¶ 16, 33, 91-100. The Court excluded Dr. 
Rausser's expert opinion that defendants intended to collude but not his opinion that defendants' behavior is consistent with 
collusion. See supra at 34-35, 37-38. Similarly, the Court excludes any of Dr. Leitzinger's opinions concerning defendants' intent, 
such as the factual issues of what defendants agreed to do in furtherance of an alleged conspiracy."
1506,26," By ""conservative,"" Dr. Leitzinger means that Dr. Rausser's choice of a constant fuel coefficient underestimates (relative to a 
variable fuel coefficient) the relationship between changes in fuel prices and changes in all-in rates that he models. "
1512,27," The first of these opinions is directed at the larger question of whether a constant or variable fuel coefficient is the best method 
for the damages model in this case. "
1513,28," In its petition for certiorari, the petitioner in Tyson Foods, Inc. v. Bouaphakeo framed one question presented ""as whether a 
class may be certified if it contains members who were not injured and have no legal right to any damages."" 136 S. Ct. at 1049 
(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Petitioner, however, abandoned that argument in its merits brief, and the 
Supreme Court did not address the issue. Id. This question is relevant to an issue in this case. "
1514,29," The plaintiffs must also show two implied requirements: (1) that their proposed class is ""sufficiently defined so as to be 
identifiable as a class""; and (2) that the named representatives ""fall within the class."" Vigus v. S. Ill. Riverboat/Casino Cruises, 
Inc., 274 F.R.D. 229, 235 (N.D. Ill. 2011) (citations omitted); see also Lindsay v. Gov't Emples. Ins. Co., 251 F.R.D. 51, 54 
(D.D.C. 2008). "
1515,30," In addition to Dr. Kalt and Dr. Leitzinger, the parties submitted the work of two other supplemental experts. Plaintiffs retained 
Dr. James McClave as a merits expert and to examine the methods and conclusions of Dr. Kalt in his critique of Dr. Rausser's 
work. See McClave Merits Rep. at 3; McClave Supp. Rep. at 2. Defendants retained Dr. Dennis Carlton to examine the methods 
and conclusions of Dr. Leitzinger in his review of Dr. Rausser's work. Carlton Rep. ¶ 4. "
1527,31," ""Coverage,"" as it is used in this context, refers to the number of shippers covered by a fuel surcharge provision during the 
class period. See, e.g., Class Certification I-leg Tr. (Sept. 27, 2016) at 364. "
1530,32," In addition to disputing whether Dr. Rausser should have used a constant or a variable fuel coefficient in his damages model, 
defendants also dispute what value the fuel price elasticity should be if the fuel price coefficient is held constant. Kalt Class Rep. 
¶ 59. Dr. Kalt calculates a different fuel price elasticity by excluding all of the STB intermodal data from the calculation. See id.; 
Rausser Supp. Reply at 51. Dr. Kalt calculates a higher fuel price elasticity of 0.222, which would result in lower overcharges. 
Kalt Class Rep. ¶¶ 59-60. In calculating his 0.222 elasticity, Dr. Kalt uses evidence common to the class. A dispute over the 
correct value of the fuel price elasticity therefore is a merits question beyond the scope of class certification. See In re 
Processed Egg Prods. Antitrust Litig., 312 F.R.D. at 195-96; In re Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer (EPDM) Antitrust Litig., 
256 F.R.D. at 90; In re Lidoderm Antitrust Litig., No. 14-2521, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24097, 2017 WL 679367, at *12, 17 (N.D. 
Cal. Feb. 21, 2017). "
1531,33," The parties also dispute whether five independent studies cited by Dr. Rausser support or reject Dr. Rausser's use of a 
constant fuel coefficient. Compare Defs. Supp. Opp. at 37, and Carlton Rep. ¶ 20, with Rausser Supp. Reply at 64, and 
Leitzinger Rep. ¶ 186. The defense experts are correct that none of the studies cited by Dr. Rausser bears on the propriety of 
using a constant elasticity when estimating overcharges. See Kalt Class Sur-Reply ¶¶ 13-16; Carlton Rep. ¶ 20. But that is 
largely beside the point. These studies give no indication of whether it is possible to estimate overcharges reliably and 
accurately in an antitrust case using a variable fuel price elasticity, Given that these independent studies discussed by both 
parties do not directly speak to the issues in this case, the Court concludes that these studies neither support nor undermine the 
reliability of Dr. Rausser's damages model and his use of a constant fuel coefficient. "
1534,34," As previously noted, supra at 74, Dr. Kalt's structural break analyses use two novel terms — pseudo pre-class period and 
pseudo class period — which refer to the revised periods that, under a structural break exercise, result when one changes the 
start of the class period. "
1535,35," Plaintiffs' experts also argued that Dr. Kalt's structural break analyses are unreliable because Dr. Kalt did not have a 
maintained hypothesis for why he chose particular dates to create his pseudo pre-class and pseudo class periods. See Rausser 
Supp. Reply at 88; Class Certification Hr'g Tr. (Sept. 28, 2016) at 668-69. Dr. Rausser, on the other hand, chose July 1, 2003, to 
separate the pre-class and the class period in his damages model based on his review of the documentary record. The Court 
finds Dr. Rausser's and Dr. McClave's arguments unpersuasive on this point. The purpose of Dr. Kalt's structural break analyses 
was to test Dr. Rausser's maintained hypothesis that the alleged conspiracy is the cause of the structural break in the damages 
model. See Class Certification Hr'g Tr. (Sept. 29, 2016) at 842. It therefore was appropriate for Dr. Kalt to test whether Dr. 
Rausser's damages model finds structural breaks at other points in time, as the D.C. Circuit suggested, because those tests 
bear on the reliability of Dr. Rausser's damages model. See In re Rail Freight Fuel Surcharge Antitrust Litig. — MDL No. 1869, 
725 F.3d at 254-55. "
1538,36," The Court is also skeptical that Dr. Kalt can switch the dependent variable in Dr. Rausser's ""reduced form pricing model"" from 
prices to costs without distorting the results the model produces. See Rausser Supp. Reply at 95 nn.319-20. Dr. Kalt never 
responded to this criticism to explain why such a switch is justified on the basis of either logic or regression modeling in 
econometrics. See Kalt Class Sur-Reply ¶ 45. "
1540,37," CSX Intermodal (""CSXI"") was a separate company from CSX during the class period and is not a party to this case. Defs. 
Supp. Opp. at 27 n.16. CSXI shippers therefore are not class members. Id. Dr. Kalt notes, however, that Dr. Rausser has 
attributed overcharges to CSXI transactions during the class period. See Kalt Class Rep. ¶ 1 n.3. For the purposes of class 
certification, the parties have not offered any argument about whether CSXI shipments should or should riot be included in Dr. 
Rausser's analysis, and therefore the Court will not address this issue at this stage. "
1541,38," At the class certification hearing, plaintiffs also argued that even though BNSF did not change its intermodal fuel surcharge 
formula that is not evidence that BNSF did not seek to apply a more aggressive formula on its intermodal shippers. For May 
2003, BNSF chose to reduce its carload fuel surcharge for one month because its higher fuel surcharge placed it at a 
competitive disadvantage. See TD Ex. 66, E-mail from Linda L. Wertz, to BNSF Carload Customers (Apr. 29, 2003, 5:08 PM), at 
BNSF-0495602; TD Ex. 72, Draft Fuel Surcharge Script, at BNSF-0572406. Because BNSF had previously chosen to reduce its 
carload fuel surcharge in the face of competitive pressure, plaintiffs contend that the fact that BNSF never changed its 
intermodal formula is ""at least as compelling an argument of collusion as it is an argument that there was no collusion."" Class 
Certification Hr'g Tr. (Sept. 27, 2016) at 305. Dr. Rausser also testified at the class certification hearing that defendants' 
intermodal formulas were ""already aggressive"" compared to other pre-class fuel surcharge formulas. Class Certification Hr'g Tr. 
(Sept. 28, 2016) at 505. The Court finds both of these arguments unpersuasive. First, plaintiffs have offered no evidence that BNSF had considered 
changing its intermodal formula and later chose not to; plaintiffs simply ask the Court to infer BNSF's intent from the absence of 
a change to its intermodal formula. Second, Dr. Rausser provided no background or further explanation for his assertion that 
intermodal formulas during the pre-class period were ""already aggressive."" The Court therefore will give this opinion no weight. "
1542,39," As noted, this 2.9% waiver rate is derived from the NS pre-class period transaction data. See supra note 12. "
1543,40," Dr. Rausser disputes that Dr. Kalt properly excluded certain legacy shipments from this overcharge calculation based on Dr. 
Rausser's legacy decomposition analysis, which the Court addresses in this section. See Rausser Supp. Rep. at 80-81. 
Regardless of the exact value of overcharges for legacy shippers, neither plaintiffs nor Dr. Rausser dispute that Dr. Rausser's 
damages model shows overcharges for legacy shippers. "
1544,41," As previously noted, NS's pre-class period waiver rate is the only currently available rate of the four defendants. See supra at 
171. "
1545,42," Dr. Rausser does not label these last two categories as ""Category 3"" and ""Category 4."" The Court will use these references for 
its own discussion. "
1547,43," Defendants assert that the overcharges for legacy shippers are caused, at least in part, by the constant fuel coefficient in Dr. 
Rausser's damages model. See Class Certification Hr'g Tr. (Sept. 27, 2016) at 222. Although the Court concluded that a 
constant fuel coefficient is more reliable than a variable fuel coefficient based on the opinions and exercises submitted by the 
experts in this case, see supra at 142-52, the Court need not determine the exact cause of the overcharges for legacy shippers. 
It is enough to conclude that Dr. Rausser's model shows unexplainable overcharges for legacy shippers. "
1550,44," In addition to Dr. Rausser's latest report, a practical basis for this finding is that Dr. Kalt adopted Dr. Rausser's 16,065 figure 
by using it as the denominator for his calculation of the percentage of uninjured class members. Kalt Class Rep. ¶ 73 n.103 (""For 
the purposes of testing [Dr.] Rausser's results and claims . . . I have accepted his [16,000] shipper designations.""). To use any 
figure other than 16,065 would render those calculations meaningless. "
1551,45," Dust Pro, Inc., a named plaintiff, is one of the class members with only negative overcharges across all of their shipments. 
See Rausser Supp. Reply, Table 22. The Court previously designated Dust Pro, Inc. as a class representative. Rail Freight III, 
287 F.R.D. at 74. Whether Dust Pro, Inc. should remain a named plaintiff that represents the class in this case is outside the 
scope of the present motion for class certification. "
1552,46," While not doctrinally significant, the Court also notes that permitting some uninjured class members at the class certification 
stage is consistent with the reality of having to use a regression model to prove class-wide injury. Regression analysis is always 
subject to prediction error, meaning that ""no matter how much data we have, we can never predict perfectly."" See GREENE, 
supra, at 121; see also Kalt Class Sur-Reply ¶ 48; Class Certification Hr'g Tr. (Sept. 29, 2016) at 864 (Dr. Kalt testified that ""no 
model fits perfectly; it's going to have prediction error""). In other words, even if, as here, a regression includes all transaction 
data such that it reflects a complete picture of the population it intends to analyze — i.e., no sampling error — there will always 
be the chance for outlier results. GREENE, supra, at 121."
1552,47," Dr. Rausser agrees that there could be a 2.5% ""margin of error,"" and that this leads to prediction error, Rausser Supp. Reply 
at 108, 125, but he says Dr. Kalt draws ""unreliable conclusions"" regarding the reliability of Dr. Rausser's damages model and 
whether shippers suffered a common impact. Id. at 125. "
1555,48," This average weekly overcharge of 9.8% is based on Dr. Rausser's most recent damages model. The average weekly 
overcharge has changed as Dr. Rausser has updated his damages model. In his Merits Report, Dr. Rausser calculated an 
average weekly overcharge of 13.6%. Rausser Merits Rep. at 171. "
1559,1, The Court is informed that Plaintiff has recently ceased business. 
1560,2," There is a dispute whether artist presale ticketing services is a relevant antitrust market, but no dispute that Ticketmaster 
services a very large percentage of the artist presales that occur."
1560,3," Defendants inappropriately respond to a large majority of Plaintiff's proposed material facts by failing to admit or deny them and 
instead merely declare them ""immaterial to the resolution of Defendants' summary judgment motion."" The Court will view any 
statement with the sole response of ""immaterial"" as admitted. "
1561,4," Plaintiff points to practices in United States venues not contracted with Ticketmaster as well as overseas venues as evidence 
that artists have more choice absent the Ticketmaster exclusive contracts."
1561,5," This is different from Defendants' characterization of the argument as being based on some kind of explicit purpose on the part 
of the venues to squeeze artists and end consumers. See Reply at 15-17. Plaintiff's point is that by structuring the market for 
venue ticketing services to be driven by large upfront payments to the venues, Ticketmaster is able to realign the unilateral 
interests of the venues to be more supportive of Ticketmaster's (allegedly) anticompetitive conduct and less supportive of free 
competition. Whether this proposition is correct is an open question, but one cannot simply assume that the venues' voluntary 
economic choices will prevent anticompetitive harm to non-contracting third-parties like artists and end consumers."
1561,6," Supporting Plaintiff's expert's theory is data purporting to show not only that ticket servicing fees charged to consumers are 
higher in the United States where there are more exclusives, but also that the percentage of total tickets sold is lower in the "
1562,," United States than in other countries where exclusive ticketing deals are rarer. Farrell Decl., Ex. 1 at 144-150. This undercuts 
the idea that the exclusive contracts at issue enhance total welfare."
1562,7," Given the economics-driven nature of modern antitrust law, it is unclear why Defendants seem to think economic ""academic 
circles"" don't count. It would be strange for a defendant in a pharmaceutical product defect case to attempt to discredit research 
into the operation of its drug or the relevant class of drugs because that research came from a university setting. Presumably, 
the problem is that the economists in question aren't Defendants' kind of economists. And perhaps Defendants are right that 
those economists do not have particularly good ideas. But that's not for the Court to sort out on a motion for summary judgment."
1562,8," This is not a case where there is, for example, no restraint as a matter of law or the restraint has no plausible effect on 
competition. There is clearly a restraint of trade and it is admittedly exclusionary to rivals. Plaintiff has presented evidence that 
the restraint is anticompetitive; Defendants have presented evidence of procompetitive justifications. So, under the rule-of-
reason, the finder of fact evaluates the arguments and weighs the effects."
1562,9," Most of Defendants' evidentiary objections concern damages-related evidence. While some objections may be meritorious with 
regard to specific pieces of evidence, there is more than sufficient admissible evidence to support some amount of damages. 
For the purposes of this motion, Defendants' most significant objection is to the introduction of Plaintiffs' records of customer 
statements regarding their reasons for not using Plaintiffs' services. This objection is also the subject of a motion in limine and 
will be discussed in more detail in the ruling on that motion. At this point it is enough to say that recitation of customer 
statements of this kind falls within the Rule 803(3) exception for statements of motive, as has been recognized by numerous 
courts. See, e.g., Callahan v. A.E.V., Inc., 182 F.3d 237, 250-53 (3d Cir. 1999); Herman Schwabe, Inc. v. United Shoe 
Machinery Corp., 297 F.2d 906, 913-14 (2d Cir. 1962) (applying motive exception pre-Federal Rules); Consol. Credit Agency v. 
Equifax, Inc., 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46851, 2005 WL 6218038, *1-2 (C.D. Cal. 2005) (Snyder, J.). "
1569,1," The Court relies upon three opinions from the Nexium litigation and, for clarity's sake, hereafter refers to them as follows: the 
district court's opinion certifying a class of EPPs, In re Nexium (Esomeprazole) Antitrust Litig., 297 F.R.D. 168 (D. Mass. Nov. 
14, 2013), as Nexium I; the district court's opinion certifying the class of DPPs, In re Nexium (Esomeprazole) Antitrust Litig., 296 
F.R.D. 47 (D. Mass. Dec. 11, 2013) as Nexium II; and the First Circuit's opinion affirming end-payor class certification, Nexium, 
777 F.3d 9, as Nexium III."
1569,2," DPPs initially listed forty-nine entities as putative members but state in their reply brief that the correct count is forty-eight. D. 
631 at 23 n.62. "
1570,3," DPPs also move to designate the following parties as class representatives: Ahold USA, Inc. and Rochester Drug Co-
Operative, Inc. (collectively, ""putative DPP representatives""). D. 574 at 1."
1570,4," Although not disputed, the Court still finds that the requirements of typicality, commonality, and adequacy of representation are 
met here. Commonality is readily met here, where DPPs allege injury from the same misconduct: the allegedly unlawful Medicis-
Impax agreement. D. 575 at 21. DPPs argue that the putative DPP representatives' claims arise from the same unlawful conduct 
by the Defendants, satisfying the typicality requirement. D. 575 at 22. DPPs have also satisfied the adequacy of representation 
requirement, Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4), by explaining that the putative DPP representatives' interests will not conflict with that of 
other class members and showing that counsel is qualified and will vigorously prosecute the case. D. 575 at 22-23. "
1571,5," Notably, most of the district courts that have applied Modafinil's impracticability guidelines were, like King Drug, those facing 
putative classes of fewer than forty members. See, e.g., Am. Sales. Co., 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 137222, at *29-32 (holding class 
of thirty-two members satisfied numerosity inquiry); Wilson v. Anthem Health Plans of Ky., Inc., No. 3:14-cv-743-TBR, 2017 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 572, at *12-18 (W.D. Ky. Jan. 3, 2017) (holding same for class of twenty-seven); Bland v. PNC Bank NA., No. 2:15-
cv-01042-AJS, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 189220, at *28-34 (W.D. Pa. Dec. 15, 2016) (holding same for subclasses of twenty-
seven, thirty-six and thirty- nine members apiece). But see In re Lidoderm Antitrust Litig., 14-md-02521-WHO, 2017 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 24097, at *72-73 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 21, 2017) (addressing Modafinil's holding for class of fifty-two or more and finding 
joinder impracticable). "
1572,6," Of the 20,000 cases in which these members appeared, only approximately 1,000 included them as plaintiffs, 288 of which 
were pharmaceutical antitrust cases, only five of which were not class actions. D. 628 ¶¶ 7-8; D. 631 at 27 n.88. Each of those 
five cases was filed alongside a class action concerning the same drug, ""purportedly to opt out"" of the class action. D. 628 ¶ 8; 
see D. 631 at 27 n.88."
1572,7," Rule 23(b)(3) also requires a putative class to show that a class action is superior to other methods of adjudicating the 
controversy. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3). Although undisputed, the Court finds that the superiority requirement of Rule 23(b)(3) has 
been met here. As DPPs argue, a class action here avoids inconsistent results, allows members with small claims to participate 
in the case and promotes judicial economy. D. 575 at 31; see Amchem, 521 U.S. at 617. "
1573,8," DPPs also provide the opinions of the following experts in support of their motion: Dr. Thomas G. McGuire, a Professor of 
Health Economics at Harvard Medical School, D. 576-2 ¶ 7; Dr. Meredith Rosenthal, a Professor of Health Economics and 
Policy at the Harvard School of Public Health and an Academic Affiliate of Greylock McKinnon Associates, a consulting and 
litigation support firm, D. 576-3 ¶ 1; John R. Tupman, Jr., a consultant with 284 Partners LLC, a professional services firm, D. 
576-4 at 6; and John Thomas, Esq., a Professor of Law at Georgetown University with a focus on patent law, D. 576-5 ¶ 2. They 
do not, however, rely on these opinions in their arguments regarding common injury to class members, see D. 575 at 26-31, so 
the Court likewise focuses on Dr. Leitzinger's report here. Defendants moved to strike a rebuttal expert opinion supporting DPPs' 
reply memorandum by Dr. Stephen W. Schondelmeyer as untimely. D. 642. Regardless, the Court has not relied upon this 
report within this Memorandum and Order. Accordingly, the Court declines to strike Dr. Schondelmeyer's report at this time. D. 
642. "
1575,9," Additionally, Dr. Leitzinger explains that couponing does not generally prevent large scale conversion to generic competitors, 
but rather addresses brand-to-brand competition, and it is unlikely that couponing alone could have impacted the market the way 
Defendants suggest. D. 632 ¶¶ 21-26. The Court is wary of venturing further into this question, as it is closely intertwined with 
the merits of Defendants' liability here. It is for the jury to decide whether the Solodyn market was impacted during this time by 
Medicis's marketing strategies or unlawful agreements restricting generic competition. "
1577,10," DPPs argue that if unconstrained competition had begun in 2009, ""all or nearly all Class members who purchased brand 
Solodyn would have substituted some less-expensive generic for higher priced brands"" and the price of generic Solodyn would 
have been substantially lower during this time. D. 631 at 14; see Relafen, 218 F.R.D. at 345 (including plaintiffs who only 
purchased brand Relafen during the period in question within the certified class, explaining that net prices of the brand drug later 
decreased when competition grew and ""additional class members might have been induced to purchase generic substitutes"" 
during the relevant period). "
1578,11," EPPs further move to designate the following parties as class representatives: United Food and Commercial Workers Local 
1776 & Participating Employers Health and Welfare Fund, the City of Providence, Rhode Island, Fraternal Order of Police, Fort 
Lauderdale 31 Insurance Trust Fund, International Union of Operating Engineers Local 132 Health and Welfare Fund, 
International Union of Operating Engineers Stationary Engineers Local 39 Health & Welfare Trust Fund, Painters District Council 
No. 30 Health and Welfare Fund, Plumbers & Pipefitters Local 178 Health & Welfare Trust Fund, Heather Morgan, Man-U 
Service Contract Trust Fund, Sheet Metal Workers Local No. 25 Health & Welfare Fund, Local 274 Health & Welfare Fund, and 
Allied Services Welfare Fund (collectively, ""putative EPP representatives""). D. 569 at 1."
1578,12," The Court concludes on this record that numerosity, commonality and typicality have been shown here. As to numerosity, 
millions of prescriptions are estimated to be involved, D. 570 at 16; D. 577 ¶ 66, establishing impracticability of joinder here. See 
Relafen, 221 F.R.D. at 267. Even a single common question can suffice to show commonality under Rule 23(a)(2), Wal-Mart, 
564 U.S. at 359, and EPPs' claims all stem from the same alleged anticompetitive conduct. D. 570 at 16; see D. 196 ¶ 288 
(listing questions of law and fact common to putative class). As to typicality, EPPs argue that the putative EPP representatives' 
claims arise from the same unlawful conduct by the Defendants as absent class members and they suffered the same injury in 
the form of overpayments, D. 570 at 17-18, satisfying the typicality requirement."
1578,13," Defendants are not challenging the adequacy of legal representation here, and the Court finds Motley Rice LLC, Hilliard & 
Shadowen LLP and Berman DeValerio have adequately prosecuted the interests of the class since the Court ordered them as 
interim co-lead counsel, D. 73 at 6, and will continue to do so. "
1580,14," Defendants filed Dr. Cremieux's report and other exhibits within the same document as their memorandum in opposition to 
EPPs' motion, D. 599. For the sake of clarity and specificity, the Court refers to Dr. Cremieux's report, D. 599 at 46-192, as D. 
599-1. "
1581,15," Dr. Frank's second and third but-for scenarios contemplate a brand loyalist percentage of around nineteen and thirty-seven 
percent, respectively. D. 577 ¶ 59. The third scenario contains a higher market share for Add-On Strength Solodyn ""due to the 
fact that in this scenario the legacy generics launched much closer in time with respect to the Add-On Solodyn launch and 
therefore did not have as much time to capture market share."" Id. "
1582,16," EPPs provide, as an example of such mechanisms, ""a claims process that requires members of the Class to submit an 
affidavit."" D. 629 at 11."
1582,17," At oral argument, Defendants also submitted a supplemental memorandum with excerpts of their depositions of Dr. Frank and 
Dr. DeBree. D. 648. In the excerpts provided, Dr. Frank admits he has not reviewed personal information of consumers or 
individual claims data for third-party payors, and Dr. DeBree acknowledges that further documentation would be necessary to 
identify purchasers, co-payment amounts and coupons. D. 648 at 1-4. EPPs argue that their experts' statements were taken out 
of context. D. 640 at 1-5. Regardless, even if their supposed concessions display that some ""individualized review"" will be 
required, D. 648 at 4, such arguments pertain to damages allocation and not proof of antitrust impact or aggregate damages."
1582,18," In Nexium III, the First Circuit explained that outside the class action context, the plaintiff could establish injury in two ways: (1) 
by arguing ""for a presumption that consumers would purchase the generic if it were available, i.e., a presumption that 
economically rational consumers faced with two identical products would purchase the less expensive alternative""; and (2) 
""through testimony by the consumer that, given the choice, he or she would have purchased the generic."" Nexium III, 777 F.3d 
at 20. The First Circuit then declared ""[t]here cannot be a more stringent burden of proof in class actions than in individual 
actions."" Id. This is especially true at the class certification stage. "
1583,19," The First Circuit held that class certification on such basis would not implicate Defendants' Seventh Amendment or due 
process rights. Nexium III, 777 F.3d at 19-20. The Court does not perceive any additional threat to Defendants' due process or 
Seventh Amendment rights where, here, uninjured parties have been excluded from aggregate damages estimates, see D. 577 
¶¶ 59-60; D. 629-3 ¶ 20, and EPPs have proposed a trial plan including jury consideration of evidence and special verdict 
questions at the damages phase, D. 571-7."
1583,20," This is also true for consumers ""who would have been prescribed (and thus purchased) an entirely different drug"" and those 
""whose insurers placed generic Solodyn on the same formulary tier that [brand] Solodyn occupied prior to generic entry,"" who 
Defendants argue ""would pay the same co-payment for generic Solodyn as they did for [brand] Solodyn and would therefore not 
be injured."" D. 599 at 21-22; D. 599-1 ¶¶ 68-69, 94. Dr. Frank argues, however, that Dr. Cremieux's suggestion that these 
groups would exist in a ""but-for"" scenario is based on ""actual data."" D. 629-3 ¶¶ 27, 39. EPPs argue that there is no basis for the 
conclusion that generic entry in 2009 would have caused more consumers to receive prescriptions for different drugs, and that 
any suggestion otherwise is ""[s]heer speculation."" D. 629 at 19. Additionally, they argue that in the ""but-for"" scenarios they 
propose, ""the generic would have been placed on formulary tiers with lower co-payments to encourage consumers to switch to 
the generic."" D. 629 at 19."
1583,21," This applies, for instance, to third-party payor health plans that are fully reimbursed by their own insurance. See D. 599 at 24; 
D. 609 at 24. Defendants argue that even though these putative class members are excluded from the class, ""[i]dentifying which 
health plans are fully insured will require examining the specific terms and contracts for each insurer."" D. 599 at 25; D. 609 at 25; 
D. 599-1 ¶ 142. Dr. Frank argues, however, that IMS Xponent data, which tracks retail sales across mail order and retail 
channels, D. 577 ¶ 56, and upon which he relies for his damages calculations, ""captures the entity that paid for the prescription 
at the pharmacy,"" and that ""a fully-insured plan, by definition, did not pay for the prescription at the pharmacy,"" D. 629-3 ¶ 70. 
The Court is persuaded that fully-insured plans will be excluded from the class on this basis. "
1585,22," Dr. Frank also provides totals broken down by state for each calculation. D. 577 ¶¶ 56 n.92, 67. "
1587,23," In Wal-Mart, the Supreme Court expressed skepticism as to whether class certification under Rule 23(b)(2) is ever appropriate 
to a class seeking monetary damages. See Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 362 (explaining ""individualized monetary claims belong in 
Rule 23(b)(3)"")."
1587,24," The Nexium I court also noted in support of its conclusion that enjoining the reverse payment agreement after trial would 
provide ""but little relief when the reverse payment agreements are set to expire just three months later."" Nexium I, 297 F.R.D. at 
174. Here, EPPs seek an injunction for harm continuing up to full competition that by their admission is set to begin in February 
2018. D. 570 at 28. The trial in this case is set to begin in March 2018. D. 353. "

Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New York, North

Kentucky, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Virginia; and the District of Columbia, by their Attorneys General (collectively, 
""States"" or ""Plaintiffs""). "
1594,2," To avoid confusion as to the appropriate defendant, I will refer only to ""Indivior"" instead of ""Reckitt."""

showing of extensive and pervasive activity in the forum state. See Reliance Steel Prods. Co. v. Watson, Ess, Marshall, & 
Engass, 675 F.2d 587, 589 (3d Cir. 1982) (quotations omitted). Nothing in the Amended Complaint allows any inference that RBH had continuous and systematic contacts with the United 
States such that the Court may exercise general jurisdiction over it. "
1603,5," Notably, the Amended Complaint does not allege a conspiracy between RBH and Indivior, and Plaintiffs concede that, under 
Copperweld, these two sister companies could not engage in a conspiracy for antitrust purposes. (Pls.' Resp. Opp'n. Mot. to 
Dismiss 8.)"
1603,6," In their opposition brief, Plaintiffs allege that ""RBH, with the help of MonoSol, an independent company, also engaged in a plan 
to withdraw Tablets from the market—to ensure generic manufacturers were unable to compete upon market entry."" (Pls.' Resp. 
Opp'n Mot. to Dismiss 10.) The Amended Complaint, however, only states that RBH ""participated in discussions"" regarding the 
removal of the tablets. (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 71, 118.) Such pleading does not amount to an allegation that MonoSol and RBH had 
any type of express plan or agreement. Plaintiffs may not now supplement their Amended Complaint with their briefing."
1603,7," Plaintiffs allege that ""at the motion to dismiss stage[,] allegations need not make any unlawful agreement 'more likely than 
independent action nor need they rule out the possibility of independent action.'"" (Pls.' Resp. Opp'n Mot. to Dismiss 10 (quoting 
Evergreen Partnering Group, Inc. v. Pactiv Corp., 720 F.3d 33, 47 (1st Cir. 2013).) While it is true that the determination of the 
motives behind alleged actions is improper at the motion to dismiss stage, the allegations of the complaint must, at minimum, 
allow the inference of concerted action done for an illegal anticompetitive purpose. "
1605,8," The sole exception to this ruling is the claim brought under Connecticut General Statute §§ 35-28 and 35-29. ""Section 35-28 
has no specific counterpart in the federal antitrust statutes but is a codification of federal case law concerning 'per se' violations 
of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1 et seq."" Bridgeport Harbour Place I, LLC v. Ganim, 111 Conn. App. 197, 958 A.2d 210, 216 
(Conn. App. 2008), aff'd, 303 Conn. 205, 32 A.3d 296 (Conn. 2011). General Statute § 35-29 is patterned after § 3 of the 
Clayton Act, a federal statute not raised by the Amended Complaint. State v. Hossan-Maxwell, Inc., 181 Conn. 655, 436 A.2d 
284, 288 (Conn. 1980). Nevertheless, the Connecticut legislature has explicitly directed that the judiciary should be guided by interpretation of federal 
antitrust statutes, providing that: ""It is the intent of the General Assembly that in construing sections 35-24 to 35-46, inclusive, 
the courts of this state shall be guided by interpretations given by the federal courts to federal antitrust statutes."" Conn. Gen. 
Stat. § 35-44b; see also Miller's Pond, 873 A.2d at 978. To the extent Plaintiffs allege that a particular action by RBH violated a 
unique provision of the Connecticut antitrust statute, the burden fell on Plaintiffs to articulate, in the Amended Complaint, the 
elements of that provision and RBH's violations. They have failed to do so."
1605,9," Plaintiffs do not contend that the state antitrust laws not specifically addressed in their brief differ from the Sherman Act 
analysis. Therefore, I dismiss those claims as well. "
1606,10," Indeed, any effort by Plaintiffs to impute conduct to RBH by grouping it in under the name ""Reckitt"" is disingenuous, as 
evidenced by their personal jurisdiction argument. When describing RBH's contacts with the United States in an effort to 
establish specific jurisdiction, Plaintiffs make no mention of any of the allegedly fraudulent conduct such as issuing press 
releases in the U.S., disparaging tablets in the U.S., or false participation in the shared REMS process in the U.S. "
1615,1," Plaintiffs refer the Court to Clear Connection, a case from the Central District of California that concerned a California state law 
antitrust claim against Comcast. The Court first notes that a case from a district court from another circuit, analyzing a California 
state law claim, enjoys only persuasive authority in this Court. Second, the plaintiff in Clear Connection alleged that Comcast 
effectively constrained trade by dictating that only one contractor would service a certain territory. Clear Connection Corp. v. 
Comcast Cable Commc'ns Mgmt., LLC, 149 F. Supp. 3d 1188, 1197 (E.D. Cal. 2015). The Clear Connection plaintiff alleged, for 
example, that it ""had a preferred vendor agreement with Comcast to install cable in the Fresno, California, area, but in 2009, 
Comcast announced a realignment plan that required the installer to serve only Fresno and halt its work elsewhere. Clear 
Connection said it tried to follow the plan, but Comcast then ended their contract while helping another installer, O.C. 
Communications, create a monopoly on Comcast cable installation in Sacramento and Fresno."" Id. at 1198. Unlike the Amended 
Complaint in this case, the plaintiff in Clear Connection had explicitly alleged that Comcast helped O.C. Communications build a 
monopoly in two cities. Such allegations are missing here; plaintiffs do not allege that Vitel and Decisive enjoy monopoly power 
in a specific market, or that they were able to raise prices in the cable installation market as a direct result of a conspiracy with 
Comcast. "

light most favorable to Plaintiff at this stage."
1634,3," The company's full name appears to be Litton Loan Servicing LP. Stone refers to Litton and Ocwen interchangeably in this

laws — since she has not satisfied the first prong. "
1642,1," ""An authorized generic is a generic drug sold by the company who markets the brand name drug (or a third party licensee).

among other things, not to launch an AG to compete with Actavis during its highly valuable 180-day exclusivity period."" CAC ¶ 
98. In their opposition, they clarify that this agreement was either express or implied. [ECF No. 59 at 21]. "
1644,4, The Court notes that the IPPs do not allege a sham litigation claim against Actavis. 
1646,5," The parties do not dispute that Noerr-Pennington immunity bars state law antitrust claims premised on patent litigation unless 
the IPPs adequately plead sham litigation. The First Circuit has not decided whether the Noerr-Pennington doctrine is applicable 
to state law claims as a matter of federal law. See Davric Me. Corp. v. Rancourt, 216 F.3d 143, 148 n.7 (1st Cir. 2000). The 
majority of circuits, however, have recognized that Noerr-Pennington emanated, at least in part, from First Amendment concerns 
and therefore can apply to certain state law claims as well as federal claims. See, e.g., Coll v. First Am. Title Ins. Co., 642 F.3d 
876, 895 (10th Cir. 2011) (""[T]he Noerr-Pennington doctrine is based upon the First Amendment, which applies to [the states] 
through the Fourteenth Amendment . . . .""). See also VIBO Corp. v. Conway, 669 F.3d 675, 683-84 (6th Cir. 2012) (""Where 
private actors petition the government for action that would violate antitrust law, the Petition Clause [of the First Amendment] 
immunizes the actors from litigation in connection with their petitioning.""); Kottle v. Northwest Kidney Ctrs., 146 F.3d 1056, 1059 
(9th Cir. 1998) (noting that the Noerr-Pennington doctrine ""sweeps broadly and is implicated by both state and federal antitrust 
claims that allege anticompetitive activity in the form of lobbying or advocacy before any branch of either federal or state 
government""); John J. Miles, Health Care and Antitrust Law, § 7:8 n.7 (2017) (collecting cases). Further, many states have 
actually adopted the Noerr-Pennington doctrine and applied it to certain state-law claims. See Coll, 642 F.3d at 895 (noting that 
""many other states have adopted and apply the Noerr-Pennington doctrine to state antitrust claims, as well as other state-law 
claims,"" collecting cases, and anticipating that the Noerr-Pennington doctrine would be applied to the New Mexico Antitrust Act); 
Apple, Inc. v. Motorola Mobility, Inc., 886 F. Supp. 2d 1061, 1077 (W.D. Wis. 2012) (applying Noerr-Pennington immunity to bar 
state-law unfair competition claim); Bayou Fleet, Inc. v. Alexander, 26 F. Supp. 2d 894, 897 (E.D. La. 1998) (dismissing claim 
under Louisiana Unfair Trade Practices Act as barred by Noerr-Pennington). Accordingly, as both parties have already done, 
albeit without explicitly addressing the issue, the Court applies the Noerr-Pennington doctrine to the IPPs' state law claims in this 
case. "
1647,6," The Supreme Court articulated ""the classic formulation of the Rule of Reason"" as follows: ""[t]he true test of legality is whether 
the restraint imposed is such as merely regulates and perhaps thereby promotes competition or whether it is such as may 
suppress or even destroy competition. To determine that question the court must ordinarily consider the facts peculiar to the "
1648,," business to which the restraint is applied; its condition before and after the restraint is imposed; the nature of the restraint and its 
effect, actual or probable. The history of the restraint, the evil believed to exist, the reason for adopting the particular remedy, the 
purpose or end sought to be attained, are all relevant facts. This is not because a good intention will save an otherwise 
objectionable regulation or the reverse; but because knowledge of intent may help the court to interpret facts and to predict 
consequences."" Am. Needle, Inc. v. Nat'l Football League, 560 U.S. 183, 203 n.10, 130 S. Ct. 2201, 176 L. Ed. 2d 947 (2010) 
(quoting Bd. of Trade of Chicago v. United States, 246 U.S. 231, 238, 38 S. Ct. 242, 62 L. Ed. 683 (1918))."
1648,7," In the instant case, Actavis references the argument set forth in the briefs filed in the related case, FWK Holdings LLC v. Shire 
PLC et al., No. 16-cv-12653, as to why a no-AG agreement is not a reverse payment. Accordingly, the Court includes 
substantially the same discussion and holding here as in the Memorandum and Order in FWK Holdings LLC v. Shire PLC et al."
1648,8," The First Circuit states in full that ""[u]nder this functional approach, 'no-AG' provisions—in which the brand-name manufacturer 
agrees not to market an 'authorized generic' version of the drug for a certain period of time—and other settlement provisions in 
which some advantage is transferred from the patent holder to the alleged infringer may constitute a reverse payment subject to 
antitrust scrutiny."" In re Nexium (Esomeprazole) Antitrust Litig., 842 F.3d 34, 42 (1st Cir. 2016). Actavis argues that the 
statement is not even dictum, and that the issue of whether a no-AG provision can be a reverse payment remains open after 
Loestrin. In Loestrin, the First Circuit explicitly declined to address whether the plaintiffs had adequately pled that the no-AG 
provision was an unlawful reverse payment and only addressed whether non-cash payments can be actionable under FTC v. 
Actavis. See In re Loestrin 24 Fe Antitrust Litig., 814 F.3d at 552-553. The Court agrees that the use of the word ""may"" in the 
context of whether a no-AG agreement is ever actionable might appear ambiguous. Nonetheless, the statement in Nexium 
strongly suggests that the Court should apply a functional analysis to the no-AG agreement at issue to determine whether or not 
it can be an unlawful reverse payment. Further, as explained infra, the Court does not rely only on this language in Nexium to 
hold that a no-AG provision may constitute an unlawful reverse payment. "
1651,9," Although it is not clear whether this paragraph (CAC ¶ 101) refers to net or gross profits, the Court makes reasonable 
inferences in the IPPs' favor at this stage. "
1652,10," Neither case cited by Defendants in support of the proposition that a royalty payment cannot constitute a reverse payment 
holds that below-market royalty payments never, under any circumstances, contribute to the type of unjustified anticompetitive 
harm that concerned the Supreme Court in FTC v. Actavis. See FTC v. AbbVie Inc., 107 F. Supp. 3d 428, 436 (E.D. Pa. 2015) 
(holding that an AG license in exchange for a below customary price did not constitute a reverse payment where the settlements 
did not pay generic company to delay entry or include a no-AG agreement); In re Actos End Payor Antitrust Litig., 2015 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 127748, 2015 WL 5610752, at *18 (holding that 75% royalty payments for an AG license from the brand to the 
generic were not reverse payments where settlement agreement ""merely fixed early-entry dates for [generic] to enter the [brand 
company's] market"")."
1652,11," The Court recognizes that settlements taking ""commonplace forms"" in which ""a party with a claim (or counterclaim) for 
damages receives a sum equal to or less than the value of its claim"" are not ""for that reason alone subject to antitrust liability."" 
FTC v. Actavis, 133 S. Ct. at 2233. See id. at 2237 (""The fact that a large, unjustified reverse payment risks antitrust liability 
does not prevent litigating parties from settling their lawsuit.""). If necessary, the Court may consider at summary judgment 
whether a below-market royalty rate alone may constitute a reverse payment. "
1653,12," To the extent that the state laws at issue are not in line with federal law on antitrust injury, the parties may more adequately 
brief the issue at the summary judgment stage."
1653,13," The IPPs also note that ""many terms of the Shire-TWi/Anchen settlement agreement itself are anticompetitive."" [ECF No. 72-3 
at 11]. The CAC, however, does not contain factual allegations based on these terms, and the Court does not consider them in 
assessing the plausibility of the IPPs' claims. "
1655,14," The Court's expectation applies to all of the surviving standalone claims (Counts 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25), and Defendants may 
raise at summary judgment, inter alia, their argument that these claims are duplicative of the claims premised on the Sherman 
Act. "
1658,15," Again, as with all of the IPPs' standalone claims, the IPPs should clarify at summary judgment their allegations in support of 
the standalone claim (Count 20) and the applicability of the Donnelly Act and § 349 in relation to the Sherman Act. See X.L.O. 
Concrete Corp., 83 N.Y.2d 513, 634 N.E.2d 158, 161, 611 N.Y.S.2d 786 (N.Y. 1994) (Donnelly Act given a different 
interpretation from Sherman Act ""only where State policy, differences in the statutory language or the legislative history justify 
such a result"" (quotation omitted)). See also Assocs. Capital Serv. of New Jersey v. Fairway Private Cars, Inc., 590 F. Supp. 10, 
13 (E.D.N.Y. 1982) (citing State v. Mobil Oil Corp., 38 N.Y.2d 460, 344 N.E.2d 357, 359, 381 N.Y.S.2d 426 (N.Y. 1976)) 
(recognizing that ""the Donnelly Act may well forbid conduct that would not violate the Sherman Act""). "
1659,16," Although the standalone claim (Count 25) may also proceed, the Court again will consider at summary judgment the 
applicable allegations and the scope of the applicable laws. See Westowne Shoes, Inc. v. Brown Grp., Inc., 104 F.3d 994, 998 
(7th Cir. 1997) (""[T]he Supreme Court of Wisconsin has ruled that the decisions of the federal courts interpreting federal 
antitrust law shall control the interpretation of Wisconsin's antitrust law.""). The Court further notes that the IPPs' reliance on 
Olstad v. Microsoft, 2005 WI 121, 284 Wis. 2d 224, 700 N.W.2d 139, 157 (Wis. 2005) for its position that the Wisconsin Antitrust 
Act has a broader scope than the Sherman Act is misplaced. The Olstad Court's statement that ""a monopolist's conduct is 
actionable under either federal law, Wisconsin law, or both"" concerns the intrastate and interstate scope of each statute, not the 
type of conduct that may violate state law but not federal law. Id. "
1662,1," Plaintiff disputes the accuracy of the Agreement produced by the Defendants. ECF 18, PgID 395. Regardless, the parties 
supply identical Sections 15.3 ""Non-Competition After Term of Agreement."" "
1663,2," Neither party disputes that they entered into a franchisor-franchisee relationship. See § 1.1 of the Agreement, ECF 16-2, PgID 
289 and ECF 18-2, PgID 428. "
1665,1," The Plaintiff filed a motion for default (Docket Entry 5) which was denied by the Clerk inasmuch as the Defendants had filed a 
motion to dismiss in lieu of an answer (Docket Entry 9). "
1670,1," The text of Oregon's anti-monopolization law, ORS 646.730, is virtually identical to Section 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 
2. In addition, the Oregon Legislature has directed that ""[t]he decisions of federal courts in construction of federal law relating to 
the same subject shall be persuasive authority in the construction of ORS [646.730]."" ORS 646.715(2). See also Oregon 
Laborers-Employers Health & Welfare Trust Fund v. Philip Morris Inc., 185 F.3d 957, 963 n. 4 (9th Cir. 1999) (""The Oregon 
antitrust statutes are almost identical to the federal antitrust statutes,"" and ""Oregon courts look to federal antitrust decisions for 
'persuasive' guidance in interpreting the state antitrust laws.""); Willamette Dental Group, P.C. v. Oregon Dental Services Corp., 
130 Or. App. 487, 492, 882 P.2d 637 (1994) (""[W]e look to federal decisions interpreting section 2 of the Sherman Act for 
persuasive, albeit not binding, guidance.""). "
1671,2," Cottrell requests that the Court take judicial notice of the fact that Boydstun Metal Works filed for bankruptcy protection in the 
U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Oregon. ECF 79. Boydstun does not object. Although district courts generally may not 
consider material beyond the pleadings in ruling on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, they may take judicial notice of documents 
referenced in the complaint, pleadings from other relevant proceedings, as well as undisputed matters in the public record, 
without converting a motion to dismiss into one for summary judgment. Intri-Plex Techs., Inc. v. Crest Grp., Inc., 499 F.3d 1048, 
1052 (9th Cir. 2007). Cottrell's request for judicial notice is granted. "
1672,3, Provisional applications are non-public.
1672,4, A utility patent application is a non-provisional application.
1672,5," Boydstun seeks a declaratory judgment of non-infringement of the '140 Patent, but that request is not part of Cottrell's pending 
motion to dismiss. The patent dispute, however, is relevant to Boydstun's claims of monopolization and bad faith enforcement of 
patents."
1672,6," Under an expedited review, patent applicants have higher duties of disclosure and must perform a pre-examination search, 
disclosing the search logic to the PTO. "
1673,7, Neither party objects to the Court taking judicial notice of the PTAB decision for purposes of this motion.
1673,8," The Noerr-Pennington doctrine derives its name from two cases, Eastern R.R. Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, 
Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 81 S. Ct. 523, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464 (1961), and United Mine Workers of Am. v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 85 S. 
Ct. 1585, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626 (1965)."
1673,9," The Walker Process fraud exception comes from Walker Process Equipment, Inc. v. Food Machinery & Chemical Corp., 382 
U.S. 172, 86 S. Ct. 347, 15 L. Ed. 2d 247 (1965). "
1676,10," See Nobelpharma AB v. Implant Innovations, Inc., 141 F.3d 1059, 1071 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (""PRE and Walker Process provide 
alternative legal grounds on which a patentee may be stripped of its immunity from the antitrust laws . . . [and] we need not find a 
way to merge these decisions. Each provides its own basis for depriving a patent owner of immunity from the antitrust laws . . . 
The Supreme Court saw no need to merge these two separate lines of cases and neither do we."")."
1676,11," Similarly, in the Ninth Circuit, ""[t]o satisfy Rule 9(b), a pleading must identify 'the who, what, when, where, and how of the 
misconduct charged,' as well as 'what is false or misleading about [the purportedly fraudulent] statement, and why it is false.'"" 
Cafasso v. Gen. Dynamics C4 Sys., Inc., 637 F.3d 1047, 1055 (9th Cir. 2011) (quoting Ebeid ex rel. United States v. Lungwitz, 
616 F.3d 993, 998 (9th Cir. 2010)); see also Juniper Networks, Inc. v. Shipley, 643 F.3d 1346, 1350 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (""Rule 9(b) 
requires a plaintiff to plead in detail 'the specific who, what, when, where, and how' of the alleged fraud.'"") (quoting BP 
Lubricants, 637 F.3d at 1309. The Ninth Circuit ""has interpreted Rule 9(b) to require that allegations of fraud are specific enough 
to give defendants notice of the particular misconduct which is alleged to constitute the fraud charged so that they can defend 
against the charge and not just deny that they have done anything wrong."" Neubronner v. Milken, 6 F.3d 666, 671-72 (9th Cir. 
1993) (quotation marks omitted); see also Gottreich v. San Francisco Investment Corp., 552 F.2d 866, 866 (9th Cir. 1977) (""[A] 
pleading is sufficient under Rule 9(b) if it identifies the circumstances constituting fraud so that the defendant can prepare an 
adequate answer from the allegations."") (quotation marks omitted). "
1677,12," In Dippin' Dots, the Federal Circuit noted that ""[i]t might be argued that because [an] omitted reference was so important to 
patentability, [the applicant] must have known of its importance and must have made a conscious decision not to disclose it."" 
476 F.3d at 1348. The court noted that while ""[t]hat argument has some force,"" it cannot sustain a finding of Walker Process 
fraud. Id. Rather, deceptive intent must be shown ""independently."" Id."
1677,13," As stated in 37 C.F.R. § 1.56(b), ""[u]nder this section, information is material to patentability when it is not cumulative to 
information already of record or being made of record in the application, and (1) It establishes, by itself or in combination with 
other information, a prima facie case of unpatentability of a claim; or (2) It refutes, or is inconsistent with, a position the applicant 
takes in: (i) Opposing an argument of unpatentability relied on by the Office, or (ii) Asserting an argument of patentability."""
1677,14," According to 37 C.F.R. § 1.155 (2015) (""Expedited examination of design applications""), applicants ""must have conducted a 
preexamination search"" and a request for expedited review must include ""[a] statement that a preexamination search was 
conducted."" "
1678,15," Cottrell also suggests that its '275 patent may have been cumulative and it would have had no obligation to disclose prior art 
that was cumulative of that which it had already disclosed. Cottrell argues in its motion to dismiss that Boydstun was required to, 
but did not, allege that Cottrell's '275 patent was not cumulative. Boydstun, however, alleges that Cottrell's '275 patent was 
highly relevant to the patent being sought and that Cummings was entirely unlike either. This is sufficient to allege that Cottrell's 
'275 Patent was not cumulative."
1678,16," As the Federal Circuit explained in Exergen, ""[i]nequitable conduct, while a broader concept than fraud, must be pled with 
particularity under Rule 9(b)."" Exergen, 575 F.3d at 1326 (quotation marks omitted)."
1678,17," In the context of an omission, there is reason to believe that the 9(b) pleading standard takes a slightly different, less strict 
form. See In re Premera Blue Cross Customer Data Security Breach Litigation, 198 F. Supp. 3d 1183, 1194 (D. Or. 2016); In re 
Anthem, Inc. Data Breach Litig., 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 70594, 2016 WL 3029783, at *35 (N.D. Cal. May 27, 2016) (discussing 
Rule 9(b) in the context of an alleged fraudulent omission)."
1678,18," This reading of Exergen also comports with the Federal Circuit's own Walker Process case law. Exergen was an inequitable 
conduct case, and although the Federal Circuit has stated that Rule 9(b) applies in the Walker Process context, it has not yet 
applied Exergen to a Walker Process fraud claim. The Court finds no indication in the Federal Circuit's Walker Process case law 
that it is insufficient to allege that a party, rather than a specific individual, fraudulently omitted information that the applicant was 
obligated to disclose. See Hydril Co. LP v. Grant Prideco LP, 474 F.3d 1344, 1346 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (finding that a Walker 
Process claimant alleging that the defendant company, Grant Prideco, concealed prior art from the PTO sufficiently alleged a 
Walker Process claim). In fact, in the Walker Process opinion itself, the U.S. Supreme Court explained that ""Walker's 
counterclaim alleged that Food Machinery obtained the patent by knowingly and willfully misrepresenting facts to the Patent 
Office."" Walker Process, 382 U.S. at 177 (emphasis added). "
1680,19," Cottrell responds that the cases Boydstun cites for the proposition that litigation involving the subject matter of a patent 
application must be disclosed say nothing about a requirement to disclose litigation regarding patents outside the ""patent family"" 
at issue. Cottrell is correct that DaimlerChrysler, for example, involved a prosecution of a continuation-in-part patent and 
undisclosed litigation about a parent patent. But DaimlerChrysler does not suggest that the litigation was relevant only because it 
involved a patent in the same family. It stands to reason that patents in the same family are highly relevant to one another; but 
patents outside the family may be as well, as Boydstun alleges here. Furthermore, the discussion in the MPEP that explains that 
the existence of litigation over the ""subject matter for which a patent is being sought"" must be disclosed to the PTO provides no 
such distinction or limitation. See MPEP 2001.06(c) (1994). "
1683,20," The parties agree that there is no express precedent in the Ninth Circuit that supports a claim of ""de facto exclusive dealing."" 
See generally Aerotec Int'l, Inc. v. Honeywell Int'l, Inc., 836 F.3d 1171, 1182 (2016) (noting that the Ninth Circuit has ""not 
explicitly recognized a 'de facto' exclusive dealing theory"" and declining to reach that question). "
1684,21," Cottrell argues that, because Boydstun is the plaintiff in this case rather than the defendant, and is seeking a declaratory 
judgment of non-enforcement of the '140 patent, it may not rely on an allegation of attorney's fees to allege antitrust injury. This 
distinction does not matter. The costs incurred in responding—in one way or another—to a cease and desist letter are no 
different in theory from the costs incurred in responding to a lawsuit alleging patent infringement. These costs may differ in 
quantity, but not quality. "

1709,52," RJR Nabisco, 136 S. Ct. at 2106-07."
1709,53," After the Supreme Court issued its decision in RJR Nabisco, Bascuñán sought leave to file a second amended complaint (the 
""SAC""). The SAC alleged an additional scheme not otherwise mentioned in the Amended Complaint, the ""Tarascona Laundering 
Scheme,"" and added more detail to the allegations regarding the four schemes already pleaded. Bascuñán argues on appeal 
that the allegations contained in the SAC (in combination with those set forth in the Amended Complaint) plausibly alleged the 
existence of several domestic injuries because they asserted that Elsaca stole assets out of accounts located in New York. See 
Plaintiff's Brief 30. However, the District Court denied Bascuñán's motion for leave to file the SAC as futile, at the same time as it 
granted Elsaca's motion to dismiss, because it too failed to allege a domestic injury, presumably for the same reason. See 
Bascuñan, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 133664, 2016 WL 5475998, at *6 n.16 (stating only that ""the proposed Second Amended 
Complaint also fails to sufficiently allege a domestic RICO injury""). As we have already stated, we conclude that the District Court committed a legal error in relying on Bascuñán's place of 
residence to determine whether or not Bascuñán plausibly alleged a domestic injury under the circumstances presented here. 
We also conclude that, when examined under the proper legal framework, Bascuñán's Amended Complaint sets forth domestic 
injuries. Because we find it necessary to reinstate Bascuñán's Amended Complaint, we do not consider the allegations set forth 
in the proposed SAC to be before us at this time. Instead, because it was based on the same legal error, we go only so far as to 
vacate the District Court's denial of Bascuñán's motion to amend his complaint and leave it to the District Court to determine, in 
the first instance, whether any further amended complaint is futile in light of our ruling. See Dougherty v. Town of North 
Hempstead Bd. of Zoning Appeals, 282 F.3d 83, 87 (2d Cir. 2002) (explaining that we review de novo the denial of a motion for

court to ""consider whether to allow the already-submitted proposed amended complaint or allow submission of another one""

the District Court heavily relied, concluded that Justice Alito's opinion for the Court made civil RICO litigation ""available to 
domestic but not foreign plaintiffs."" Id. at 2115. With respect, we think that this was a misreading of the Majority's opinion. Justice Alito concluded, on the basis of prior precedent, that the Court should apply the presumption against extraterritoriality to 
the RICO statute's private right of action, in addition to its substantive prohibitions. Id. at 2106. He then determined that nothing 
in Section 1964(c) established that the statute reaches foreign injuries and, as a result, a civil RICO plaintiff must allege a 
domestic injury. Id. at 2108. He expressly declined to indicate what constitutes a domestic or foreign injury and, despite Justice 
Ginsburg's reading to the contrary, never equated the location of a civil RICO plaintiff's place of residence with the location of 
that plaintiff's alleged injury. Id. at 2111. Instead, in the context of explaining why civil RICO, unlike Section 4 the Clayton Act, 15 
U.S.C. § 15, does not apply to foreign injuries (disagreeing with Justice Ginsburg on that specific point), Justice Alito stated that 
civil RICO's failure to provide recovery for foreign injuries ""does not mean that foreign plaintiffs may not sue under RICO,"" RJR

Missouri, Nebraska, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, and 
Washington; the Commonwealths of Kentucky, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Virginia; and the District of Columbia, by their 
Attorneys General (collectively, ""Plaintiffs"" or ""States"")."
1719,2," For a more comprehensive statement of the factual allegations underlying this lawsuit, I incorporate by reference my opinion in 
In re Suboxone (Buprenorphine Hydrochloride and Naloxone) Antitrust Litig., No. 16-5073, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 145501, 2017 
WL 3967911, at *1-6 (E.D. Pa. Sept. 8, 2017). For purposes of the present motion, however, I focus solely on MonoSol Rx LLC 
and the facts relevant to the issues before me. My recitation of the facts assumes the truth of the factual statements in the 
Amended Complaint. Fowler v. UPMC Shadyside, 578 F.3d 203, 211 (3d Cir. 2009). "
1720,3," Indivior, Inc. (""Indivior) was formerly incorporated under the name of Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals, Inc. In December 
2014, Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals, Inc. was demerged from its prior parent, the Reckitt Benckiser Group PLC, into 
Indivior PLC. (Am. Compl. ¶ 11.) Although the Amended Complaint uses the name ""Reckitt"" throughout the document, Indivior is 
now the proper name for this Defendant. To avoid confusion, I refer only to ""Indivior"" instead of ""Reckitt."""
1720,4," The FDA may designate a drug as an ""orphan drug"" when it determines that either (a) the drug is intended for the safe and 
effective, treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a rare disease or disorder that affects fewer than 200,000 people in the United 
States; or (b) the disease or disorder affects greater than 200,000, but the manufacturer is not reasonably expected to recover 
the costs of developing and marketing the treatment drug from sales in the United States. (Am. Compl. ¶ 35.) After designation 
as an orphan drug, the FDA approves the drug for marketing. (Id. ¶ 36.) It then becomes eligible for a seven-year exclusivity 
period during which it may be marketed as a brand-name drug free from generic competition. (Id.)"
1720,5," Oral drugs proven to be both pharmaceutically equivalent and bioequivalent to a branded oral drug receive an ""AB"" rating from 
the FDA, indicating they are therapeutically equivalent to other drugs with the same rating in the same category. (Id. ¶ 30.) In 
most cases, only oral drugs with an AB rating may be substituted by pharmacists for a physician's prescription of a brand-name 
drug without the physician's approval. (Id.) The FDA publishes a list of all approved drugs and therapeutic equivalents in the 
Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (the ""Orange Book""). (Id. ¶ 31.) Once the FDA approves an ANDA and determines that the generic drug is AB-rated to the branded drug, state laws govern how 
the generic may be substituted for the brand name drug prescribed by physicians. (Id. ¶ 32.) In most states and under most 
health plans, a pharmacist may, and in many cases must, substitute an AB-rated generic drug for a prescribed brand-name 
drug. (Id. ¶ 32.) "
1721,6," The REMS is a document provided by the manufacturer and contains a risk management plan or risk-minimization strategy that 
goes beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of a drug outweigh the risk. (Id. ¶ 58.) "
1722,7," Under § 505 of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, any individual may submit a ""citizen petition"" asking the FDA to take, or 
refrain from taking, certain administrative action. (Id. ¶ 99.) Such petitions are commonly used to express concerns about the 
safety or legality of a product. (Id.) Pursuant to 21 C.F.R. § 10.30, the FDA then has 150 days to respond to the citizen petition. 
(Id. ¶ 100.) During that period, FDA approval of any ANDA pending for the subject product is typically delayed, leading to some 
abuse by brand-name manufacturers in filing baseless citizen petitions in order to prolong their monopolies. (Id. ¶ 101.) "
1724,8," A Section 2 conspiracy claim has four elements: (1) an agreement to monopolize; (2) an overt act in furtherance of the 
conspiracy; (3) a specific intent to monopolize; and (4) a causal connection between the conspiracy and the injury alleged. 
Howard Hess Dental Labs. Inc. v. Dentsply Int'l, Inc., 602 F.3d 237, 253 (3d Cir. 2010) (citing United States v. Yellow Cab Co., 
332 U.S. 218, 224-25, 67 S. Ct. 1560, 91 L. Ed. 2010 (1947); Am. Tobacco Co. v. United States, 328 U.S. 781, 788, 809, 66 S. 
Ct. 1125, 90 L. Ed. 1575 (1946)). ""A plaintiff asserting a Section 1 claim also must allege four elements: '(1) concerted action by 
the defendants; [(2)] that produced anti-competitive effects within the relevant product and geographic markets; (3) that the 
concerted actions were illegal; and (4) that it was injured as a proximate result of the concerted action.'"" Id. (quoting Gordon v. 
Lewistown Hosp., 423 F.3d 184, 207 (3d Cir. 2005)). "
1726,9," In further support of its argument, MonoSol cites to several other cases that I did not previously address. First, it relies on 
Deutscher Tennis Bund v. ATP Tour, Inc., 610 F.3d 820, 834-35 (3d Cir. 2010) for the blanket proposition that Copperweld 
applies to joint ventures of separately-owned entities. In that case, however, the court expressly acknowledged that ""the fact that 
joint venturers pursue the common interest of the whole is generally not enough, by itself, to render them a single entity."" Id. at 
835 (quotation omitted). MonoSol also cites to Peerless Heater Co. v. Mestek, Inc., No. 98-6532, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6664, 2000 WL 637082 (E.D. 
Pa. May 11, 2000). In Peerless, however, the court found that the corporation was not capable of conspiring with its own sales 
agents or representatives in restraint of trade. 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6664, [WL] at *6. By contrast, in this case, Indivior and 
MonoSol are entirely separate corporations with independent economic structures and separate centers of decisionmaking that 
were jointly pursuing a common interest. Finally, MonoSol cites Texaco, Inc. v. Dagher, 547 U.S. 1, 4, 126 S. Ct. 1276, 164 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2006) for the proposition that it is 
not per se illegal under § 1 of the Sherman Act for a lawfully integrated venture to set the prices at which it sells its products. 
That case neither applied Copperweld nor found that two companies engaged in a joint venture could not conspire to 
monopolize by engaging in various anticompetitive acts under § 2 of the Sherman Act. "
1729,10," Via a footnote in its brief, MonoSol argues that Plaintiffs fail to allege acts that MonoSol took in furtherance of a Section 2 
conspiracy because there are no claims against MonoSol for monopolization or attempted monopolization. It is well established, 
however, that claims of monopolization or attempted monopolization require that the defendant itself compete directly in a 
certain market, whereas a claim of conspiracy to monopolize requires only that a company agree with another company to assist 
the first in its attempt to monopolize the relevant market. Arnold Chevrolet LLC v. Tribune Co., 418 F. Supp. 2d 172, 185 
(E.D.N.Y. 2006). In other words, a defendant need not be liable for monopolization or attempted monopolization in order to be 
liable for a section 2 claim for conspiracy to monopolize. "
1730,11," Neither of these cases supports Defendant's argument. Exxon Corp. involved a superseding government act in the context of 
a tort claim, not an antitrust claim. Exxon Corp., 875 F.2d at 1089. Midland Export discussed causation as one of many factors in 
determining whether the plaintiffs had standing to bring an antitrust suit; it did not address the requisite pleading of causation for 
an antitrust claim. Midland Export, 947 F. Supp. at 166."
1730,12," I previously addressed an identical argument on reconsideration of my decision regarding the Class Action Complaint. In re 
Suboxone, MDL No. 2445, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 184458, 2015 WL 12910728 (E.D. Pa. Apr. 14, 2015). In that matter, Indivior 
argued that even if its citizen petition caused the FDA to delay approval of the generic's ANDA, the FDA's actions are a 
supervening cause because the generic manufacturers had failed to follow the proper FDA procedures. 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
184458, [WL] at *2. I rejected that argument, noting that although Indivior could raise supervening causation as an affirmative 
defense, the allegations of the complaint allowed an inference that the government's decision was induced by the defendant's 
deception or wrongful conduct. Id. I ultimately found that the plaintiffs had alleged sufficient facts to plausibly plead causation. "
1731,13," MonoSol erroneously relies on the ""learned intermediary doctrine."" (See Def.'s Mem. Supp. Mot. to Dismiss 20 (citing Thom v. 
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., 353 F.3d 848 (10th Cir. 2003); Heindel v. Pfizer, Inc., 381 F. Supp. 2d 364 (D.N.J. 2004).) This 
doctrine has its origins and application solely in tort law and provides that when a drug is available only upon prescription of a 
duly licensed physician, the warning required is not to the general public or patient, but to the prescribing doctor. Heindel, 381 F. 
Supp. 2d at 382. MonoSol has not cited to any cases in which this doctrine was applied to defeat the causal link between a 
monopolist's anticompetitive behavior in the drug market and a consumer's injuries. "
1735,14," With a citation to each of the relevant state statutes in this case, MonoSol represents that the statute of limitations for each of 
the state law claims is also four years. (Def.'s Mem. Supp. Mot. to Dismiss 24 n.13.) Plaintiffs, on the other hand, allege that a 
number of the states' statute of limitations periods do not run against claims by the State itself. (Pls.' Resp. Opp'n Mot. to "
1736,," Dismiss 22 n.108.) For the sake of judicial economy, I accept for purposes of this Motion only that all of the relevant state 
statutes have four-year statutes of limitation. "
1738,*," Of the District of Maine, sitting by designation. "
1741,1," Although the reply brief contains arguments in two footnotes that some of the petitions were not objectively reasonable, it does 
not make any effort to explain why this court should excuse PRTC's failure to make these arguments in its opening brief."
1741,2," As indicated above, PRTC does argue that the district court erred in finding that OneLink actually prevailed on four petitions. 
PRTC also claims that the district court neglected to assess one petition filed by a third party because it erroneously deemed the 
petition not to have been funded by PRTC. PRTC does not, however, argue in its main brief that any of those five petitions were 
actually baseless in the sense of lacking any reasonably realistic prospect of success. "
1743,3," California Motor Transport does at the same time remain independently relevant to misconduct, such as fraud, bribery or 
threats, in connection with the filing of claims, baseless or not. 404 U.S. at 512-13. See also id. at 518 (Stewart, J., concurring) 
(chronicling threats)."
1743,4," PRTC does not dispute that Noerr-Pennington immunity applies to the claim under the Puerto Rico Anti-Monopoly Act. It has 
also not argued that the district court should have remanded the Puerto Rico claims instead of granting summary judgment on 
those claims along with the federal claims. We also need not consider PRTC's argument that the district court erred in its finding 
on causation in the first summary judgment decision. Our holding accepts that Noerr-Pennington immunity applied to each 
petition because of its objective reasonableness, not because of its causal role. "
1744,5," The case concerns an alleged monopoly violation under both the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 2, and the Puerto Rico Anti-
Monopoly Act, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 10, § 260. Puerto Rico's anti-monopolization provision corresponds with that of the Sherman 
Act, and the parties have not suggested that the provisions are interpreted differently. "
1753,1," The exact number and identity of the plaintiffs in this case is unclear. One hundred three parties are listed on the docket, while 
eighty-six appear on the Fourth Amended Complaint; not all shown on the Fourth Amended Complaint are on the docket. Within 
the Fourth Amended Complaint, under ""Parties,"" the plaintiffs identify themselves using fifty-one bullet points, though some of 
these bullet points contain more than one name. See Docket # 253, at 6-7. For purposes of this motion, I count each of the bullet 
points in the ""Parties"" section as a plaintiff, totaling fifty-one plaintiffs. "
1754,2," Plaintiffs contend that Ocean Spray should not be considered an agricultural cooperative because it does not attempt to 
maximize returns for all of its members. See Docket # 283, at 2. Rather, plaintiffs maintain that Ocean Spray is a ""Consumer 
Products Company."" Id. Because Ocean Spray has cooperative marketing agreements with its growers, under which growers 
deliver fruit and Ocean Spray agrees to market 100% of the fruit, I refer to Ocean Spray as a cooperative, regardless of whether 
Ocean Spray does indeed try to maximize profits for all of its members. Further, Ocean Spray maintains it is a qualified 
cooperative under Subchapter T of the Internal Revenue Code. "
1755,3," As explained in my 2015 Memorandum of Decision, HN2[
] monopsonization describes consolidation of a market into one buyer, and like monopolization, is a violation of section 2 of the Sherman Act. Docket # 143, at 8."
1755,4," Plaintiffs also allege that prior to each auction, Ocean Spray requires bidders to submit an application that includes the amount 
of concentrate sought. Ocean Spray then tells the individual bidders on how much concentrate they are allowed to bid. After the 
auction closes, plaintiffs claim, Ocean Spray sells bidders additional concentrate. "
1756,5," In their complaint, plaintiffs allege that ""[t]he Board is dominated by A Pool growers — eight of the thirteen member-directors 
have exclusively A Pool acreage. The five remaining member-directors have acres in the A Pool and the B Pool and all have a 
sizable majority in the A Pool."" Docket # 253, at ¶ 30."
1756,6," Ocean Spray has previously moved for summary judgment on this basis, see Docket # 115, and I denied its motion with 
respect to plaintiffs' monopsonization count, Docket # 143, at 13. Ocean Spray maintains that ""[s]ince that time, the parties have 
undertaken discovery that establishes, beyond dispute, that [plaintiffs'] allegations are not true."" Docket # 255, at 9. In addition, 
Ocean Spray relies on recent case law from the Second Circuit, which Ocean Spray claims ""makes clear that plaintiffs here lack 
antitrust injury in addition to alleging injuries that are too remote."" Id. at 9-10. Ocean Spray also moves for summary judgment on the basis that ""as a matter of economic reality,"" it cannot be a monopsonist 
because it is not a ""buyer"" of cranberries but rather gives the growers proceeds from the products it sells. Docket # 255, at 22-
23. Here, the nature of the alleged conspiracy is that Ocean Spray allegedly artificially depressed concentrate prices at least in 
part to generate lower returns for B pool growers. That is, it allegedly functioned as a purchaser of cranberries, compensating 
growers using the proceeds from the auction. Whether plaintiffs will ultimately prevail on their theory at trial, absent case law to 
support Ocean Spray's contention, Ocean Spray is not entitled to summary judgment on this issue."
1756,7," At the July 13, 2017, hearing, Ocean Spray maintained that there were no B pool growers left in the case, notwithstanding that 
plaintiffs' Fourth Amended Complaint includes two B pool growers as plaintiffs. Ocean Spray has provided no evidence that 
these plaintiffs are not B pool growers or explanation of why their claims are no longer relevant. Accordingly, I analyze whether 
these B pool growers have standing. "
1757,8, See supra note 6. 
1758,9," Relying on this decision and its reasoning, the district court later held that first level purchasers of aluminum did not suffer an 
antitrust injury either. In re Aluminum Warehousing Antitrust Litig., No. 13-md-2481 (KBF), 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 138437, 2016 
W L 5818585, at *1, *8 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 5, 2016); see also AGFA Corp. v. Goldman Sachs Grp., Inc., No. 14-cv-0211 (KBF), 2016 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 165563, 2016 WL 7009031, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 30, 2016). "
1760,10," Plaintiffs seem to be making, albeit obliquely, an argument for ""a so-called 'umbrella theory' of liability,"" In re: London Silver 
Fixing, Ltd., 213 F. Supp. 3d at 554. HN10[
] ""Umbrella standing concerns are most often evident when a cartel controls only 
part of a market, but a consumer who dealt with a non-cartel member alleges that he sustained injury by virtue of the cartel's 
raising of prices in the market as a whole."" Id. at 554-55 (quoting Gelboim v. Bank of Am. Corp., 823 F.3d 759, 778 (2d Cir. 
2016), cert. denied, 137 S. Ct. 814, 196 L. Ed. 2d 599 (2017)). ""The antitrust standing of umbrella purchasers under such 
circumstances has produced a split in authority among"" circuit courts, Gelboim, 823 F.3d at 778 (collecting cases), as well as 
district courts, see Knevelbaard Dairies v. Kraft Foods, Inc., 232 F.3d 979, 991 n.9 (9th Cir. 2000) (collecting cases). I need not 
resolve the issue here because under the facts of this case, such a theory would not be appropriate for the independent 
growers. Specifically, given that the independent growers' theory implicates transactions in two markets, see Docket # 253, at ¶ 
42, the challenges in assessing harm under these circumstances, and the ability of better positioned plaintiffs to bring a claim, I 
conclude the independent growers do not have antitrust standing here, whatever the merits of umbrella standing in other cases."
1760,11," In my 2015 decision, I held that these plaintiffs were ""well situated to pursue this antitrust claim."" Docket # 143, at 12. Since 
that time, however, the discovery produced, taken most favorably to plaintiffs, has shown that as a matter of law, these plaintiffs 
do not have antitrust standing. "
1775,1," Defendants' alternate motion for partial summary judgment for a finding of fact under Rule 56(g) that Watson could not have 
launched its generic earlier than December 17, 2012 is not opposed by plaintiffs and is GRANTED."
1775,2," On October 31, 2017, I signed a stipulated dismissal, dismissing with prejudice the claims asserted by Retailer Plaintiffs 
Walgreen Co., Safeway Inc., Kroger Co., HEB Grocery Company L.P., Albertson's LLC., CVS Pharmacy, Inc., Rite Aid Corp., 
and Rite Aid Hdqtrs Corp. against Defendant Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. However, as the defense arguments are asserted by all 
three defendants against all of the claims asserted by plaintiffs, nothing in this Order appears to be impacted by the Stipulated 
Dismissal. "
1777,3," The district court considered whether plaintiffs had introduced evidence in the antitrust case showing that a ""reasonable juror 
could find"" that the generic defendant would have prevailed in the underlying patent litigations. Id. Because defendants' expert 
presented unchallenged testimony that the generic had only a 20% chance of success in one of the cases ""no reasonable juror"" 
could have found that the generic would have succeeded. Id. at 767. The Third Circuit affirmed. 868 F.3d at 169 (""no reasonable 
jury could conclude that Anchen would have been more likely than not to prevail.""). "
1778,4," As broader support for their argument that a valid patent cuts off plaintiffs' antitrust claims, defendants rely on a line of cases 
holding that plaintiffs cannot prove antitrust injury where an existing law or regulation would have prevented the competition that 
was allegedly foreclosed by collusive conduct. See Defs. Mot. SJ at 7 & n.9. Plaintiffs persuasively distinguish those cases 
because here, Watson would have been expressly permitted by regulation to enter the market upon ANDA approval and 
because patent law does not require a competitor to obtain permission before entering the market, but instead allows the 
patentee to seek an injunction stopping that competition."
1778,5," Plaintiffs also rely on a series of cases that rejected the related but distinct concept that the regulatory requirements of the 
Hatch/Waxman Act (the 30-month automatic stay and the requirements of securing ANDAs) could be the cause of the plaintiffs' 
antitrust injury instead of the conduct of the defendants in engaging in inequitable conduct before the PTO and filing sham patent 
litigation cases. See, e.g., In re Metoprolol Succinate Direct Purchaser Antitrust Litig., No. CIV.A. 06-52 (GMS), 2010 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 36303, 2010 WL 1485328, at *7 (D. Del. Apr. 13, 2010); In re K-Dur Antitrust Litig., 338 F. Supp. 2d 517, 535 (D.N.J. 
2004) (rejecting Hatch/Waxman Act as creating intervening cause of antitrust injuries defeating claims, but further recognizing 
that ""conjecture"" that at-risk launch ""may have been improvident given the risk that the generic manufacturer might lose the 
patent suit and been liable for damages, is not this Court's concern on a motion to dismiss.""). Defendants point out that those 
cases have been superseded on the point relevant here by the Nexium and Wellbutrin decisions. "
1779,6," The district court subsequently certified that question for interlocutory review. In re Aggrenox Antitrust Litig, No. 3:14-MD-2516 
SRU, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 94516, 2015 WL 4459607 (D. Conn. July 21, 2015)."

1781,8," The Takeda reference is U.S. Patent No. 4,695,465, entitled ""Soft Patch."" Takeda Patent (Sharp Decl., Ex. 16 [Dkt. No. 819-
17]). The patent discloses 161 compounds that can be used in a hydrogel patch in various concentrations where the 
""concentration of the drug need only be that which exhibits the expected clinical effect, and in many instances ranges from about 
0.01 to 14 weight percent, preferably 0.05 to 10 weight percent."" Id. 3:30-34."
1781,9," Plaintiffs note that the burden to show non-enablement fell on Endo. Amgen Inc. v. Hoechst Marion Roussel, Inc., 314 F.3d 
1313, 1355 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (""Thus, a court cannot ignore an asserted prior art patent in evaluating a defense of invalidity for 
anticipation, just because the accused infringer has not proven it enabled. Like the applicant in ex parte prosecution, however, 
the patentee may argue that the relevant claimed or unclaimed disclosures of a prior art patent are not enabled and therefore 
are not pertinent prior art. If a patentee presents evidence of nonenablement that a trial court finds persuasive, the trial court 
must then exclude that particular prior art patent in any anticipation inquiry, for then the presumption has been overcome."")."
1781,10," Defendants move to exclude Adelman's testimony. The motion, as discussed below, is DENIED."
1781,11," Plaintiffs mention in passing that they also rely on Dr. Kishore Shah for anticipation. Shah Report (Sharp Decl., Ex. 14 [Dkt. 
No. 819-15]) ¶¶ 54-72. However, they do not discuss Shah's opinions in their Opposition. Shah's opinions are likewise the 
subject of a motion to exclude by defendants, which as discussed below is DENIED. "
1782,12," In closing, Judge Sleet made the following comments: . . . I am a jury of one, and in this case, it seems to be not inappropriate for me to take advantage of the opportunity to ask a 
few [**57]  questions of counsel. It may help me resolve this case. So, as you both know, jurors are typically instructed that as the fact-finder, they are free to accept or reject all or any part of 
any witness' testimony, including that of so-called opinion witnesses or expert witnesses. My question is: What result should there be if I largely discount the testimony of Dr. Walters either because of an absence 
of opinion . . . in critical areas, or because I simply don't find him credible over Dr. Lane? Asimow Decl., Ex. 5, Closing Arg. Tr. 44. Defendants place much support on these comments as indicating that Judge Sleet 
intended to find Lane credible over Walters, and given the standard of review on anticipation, the Federal Circuit would have 
been bound to follow Judge Sleet's acceptance of Lane's opinion there was no anticipation. Defendants read too much into 
these comments."
1782,13," Plaintiffs in passing note that they also rely on Shah, who opines that Watson would have won at trial and on appeal on 
obviousness because, even if not anticipating, the patent was invalid over prior art. Shah Report ¶¶ 73-97. Neither side 
addresses Shah's opinions in their summary judgment briefing."
1782,14," Adelman ¶ 84 (""The only conceivable argument against a combination of the Teikoku Hydrogel Art with the Topical Lidocaine 
Art is that there was no apparent reason to combine lidocaine with a hydrogel patch formulation, but Dr. Lane, Endo's own 
expert, foreclosed that argument when she admitted that Rowbotham suggests to those of ordinary skill in the art that a patch 
formulation should be created to better control the rate of administration of lidocaine. Trial Tr. at 996:21-25.""). "
1783,15," As noted above, I do not interpret Judge Sleet's questions asking counsel to opine on the impact of his crediting one expert 
over another as strongly and concretely as defendants do."
1783,16," As explained by the Federal Circuit, ""as a general matter, the materiality required to establish inequitable conduct is but-for 
materiality. When an applicant fails to disclose prior art to the PTO, that prior art is but-for material if the PTO would not have 
allowed a claim had it been aware of the undisclosed prior art."" Therasense, Inc. v. Becton, Dickinson & Co., 649 F.3d 1276, 
1291 (Fed. Cir. 2011). There is an exception for but-for materiality, ""[w]hen the patentee has engaged in affirmative acts of 
egregious misconduct, such as the filing of an unmistakably false affidavit, the misconduct is material."" Id. at 1292. "
1784,17," Plaintiffs also argue, as a fallback position, that defendants failed to produce evidence showing that if Endo/Teikoku won the 
'529 patent litigation, Endo/Teikoku would have forced Watson off the market. Plaintiffs contend that even if Endo/Teikoku had 
been successful at trial and on the eventual appeal, an injunction forcing Watson off the market was uncertain as to timing 
(because when that remedy would have been available depended on what grounds the Federal Circuit decided on and whether 
judgment was entered by the Circuit or the case was remanded to Judge Sleet) and as to certainty (because Endo/Teikoku 
could well have determined that Watson's penetration into the market made it more profitable for Endo/Teikoku to allow Watson 
to continue its sales with royalties). In light of the rulings made above, I need not reach this argument on summary judgment. "
1785,18," In rejecting plaintiffs' alternate settlement causation theory, the district court also noted that plaintiffs' expert Leitzinger (who is 
plaintiffs' expert here) did not explain what the proposed ""alternate"" settlement would have looked like and rested his testimony 
solely on fact that their reverse payment was not ""justified."" Id. at 757-58."
1785,19," Plaintiffs spend significant time arguing that no-payment settlements of Hatch Waxman Act (HWA) patent litigation are 
common (if not predominant) and arguing that HWA settlements that restrict generic access, even in absence of payments, still 
have anticompetitive effects. Those points are not in dispute."
1785,20," As explained by the Ninth Circuit, ""[i]n a hypothetical economic construction, such as the one underlying Murphy's theory on 
lost past profits, economic rationality must be assumed for all competitors, absent the strongest evidence of chronic irrationality. 
Otherwise it will be impossible to keep speculation in check."" Murphy Tugboat Co. v. Crowley, 658 F.2d 1256, 1262 (9th Cir. 
1981). "
1786,21," The cases that defendants rely on to argue that economic rationality and profit-maximizing are not appropriate (much less 
required) assumptions stand at most as criticisms of expert testimony that ignored established facts and market structures and 
attempted to rely only on theories of rationality/profit-maximization. See, e.g., Am. Booksellers Ass'n, Inc. v. Barnes & Noble, 
Inc., 135 F. Supp. 2d 1031, 1040 (N.D. Cal. 2001); The Iams Co. v. Nutro Prods., Inc., No. 3:00-CV-566, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
31141, 2004 WL 5496244, at *3 (S.D. Ohio June 30, 2004) (expert could not rely on logical economic rationality assumptions to 
argue ""perfect cross-elasticity of demand"" between two brands of dog food where it was ""untested by the evidence in this 
case.""). "
1787,22," Defendants' argument that Elhauge's and Leffler's opinions should be discounted (or excluded) because they are not experts 
in legal negotiations or negotiations more generally (like defense expert Moffitt), is also unpersuasive, particularly given the 
profit-maximizing assumption that runs throughout the legal and factual issues to be resolved in this case. "
1788,23," The relevant antitrust market includes a geographic market and a product market. Tanaka v. Univ. of S. California, 252 F.3d 
1059, 1063 (9th Cir. 2001). There is no dispute that the geographic market is the United States. "
1789,24," ""In limited settings [ ] the relevant product market may be narrowed beyond the boundaries of physical interchangeability and 
cross-price elasticity to account for identifiable submarkets or product clusters."" Thurman Indus. 875 F.2d at 1374. As the Ninth 
Circuit has explained, ""[t]he concept of identifying submarkets for antitrust purposes had its first exposition in Brown Shoe . . . . 
There, the Supreme Court delineated several factors for consideration in the conduct of a submarket inquiry: whether industry or 
the public recognizes the proposed submarket as a separate economic entity; whether the products involved have peculiar 
characteristics or uses; whether unique production facilities are involved; and whether distinct customers, distinct prices, price 
change sensitivity, or specialized vendors highlight the proposed submarket."" Id. at 1375. The Brown Shoe ""indicia are practical 
aids for identifying the areas of actual or potential competition and that their presence or absence does not decide automatically 
the submarket issue."" Id."
1789,25," Gorlick also recognized, however, that products only need to be reasonably interchangeable, not ""perfectly fungible"" or 
physically identical. Id. at 1025. "
1790,26," Id. pg. 109 at n.2 (""In assessing whether products are within the relevant market, the jury must consider not only whether the 
products are functionally similar but also whether the products are economically interchangeable. That is, there must be cross-
price elasticity of demand."") (emphasis added). "
1791,27," Defendants do not argue about a submarket, but they rely for support in considering these other factors on the Brown Shoe 
decision, where the Supreme Court recognized that ""within this broad market, well-defined submarkets may exist which, in 
themselves, constitute product markets for antitrust purposes. . . .[citation omitted]. The boundaries of such a submarket may be 
determined by examining such practical indicia as industry or public recognition of the submarket as a separate economic entity, 
the product's peculiar characteristics and uses, unique production facilities, distinct customers, distinct prices, sensitivity to price 
changes, and specialized vendors."" 370 U.S. at 325."
1791,28," Gilligan believes that Lidoderm is most often prescribed to treat musculoskeletal/myofascial pain. Id. ¶ 25. Bell concurs. Bell 
Report ¶ 46 (finding 57% of Lidoderm prescriptions were for musculoskeletal pain)."
1791,29," Gilligan defines ""interchangeable"" as ""that a treating clinician considers these treatments to be therapeutically equivalent: their 
relative risks and benefits are such that they are frequently substituted for each other depending on the patient's specific 
circumstances. This does not mean that the treatments are identical in other respects, such as their formulation, mechanism of 
action, method of application, or risks and benefits for particular patients."" Id. ¶ 17."
1791,30," As part of his analysis, Bell opined that ""off label"" use of Lidoderm accounts for 92% of prescriptions. Id. ¶¶ 46, 64. As 
discussed below, if plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment as to the market definition is not granted, plaintiffs' move to 
exclude the testimony of Dr. Bell. "
1792,31," In defining the market, Bell also examined evidence regarding the prevalence of non-price competition in the pharmaceutical 
market, concluding that ""competitive constraints on Endo"" required Endo to give significant rebates and other price concessions 
to MCOs and used free samples and other marketing efforts to encourage health care organizations and doctors to prescribe 
Lidoderm. Id. ¶¶ 70-76."
1792,32," The Court went onto note also that ""[u]seful to that determination is, among other things, the trade's own characterization of 
the products involved."" Id."
1792,33," Defendants argue that the Eighth Circuit's emphasis on lack of cross-elasticity in Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) was limited by 
HDC Med., Inc. v. Minntech Corp., 474 F.3d 543, 548 (8th Cir. 2007). But any limitation was on a different proposition. HDC 
simply recognized that ADM itself recognized a ""narrow exception to the general prohibition against placing great weight on only 
price differentials"" in determining whether products reside in the same market, in situations where government price support 
props up one product's price. Id. at 548 (emphasis added). Plaintiffs here are not arguing that mere price differentials between 
Lidoderm and the generics ultimately introduced is evidence of the market definition. Defendants' reliance on In re Remeron 
Direct Purchaser Antitrust Litig., 367 F. Supp. 2d 675, 681 (D.N.J. 2005), where plaintiffs did exactly that, is similarly misplaced. "
1793,34," Defendants point out that in a concurrence Judge Kopf found it odd ""to define a product market based upon the actions of 
actors who eschew rational economic considerations"" because doctors paid no mind to price, and that ""oddity seems especially 
strange where, as here, there is no real dispute that (1) both drugs are effective when used to treat the illness about which the 
doctors testified and (2) internal records from the defendant raise an odor of predation."" F.T.C. v. Lundbeck, Inc., 650 F.3d at 
1243. The facts are different here where no one is contending there is a drug that was identical to Lidoderm (delivering lidocaine 
in a topical patch) on the market during the relevant time (although topical lidocaine cream was on the market)."
1793,35," Part of that analysis included reliance on the FDA's approval of ""virtually identical"" labeling for the products that treat the same 
condition, as well as evidence that managed care providers encouraged the widespread substitution of numerous other oral 
tetracyclines for Doryx; showings that are absent here. Mylan, 838 F.3d at 436."
1793,36," Defendants also rely on Bayer Schering Pharma AG v. Sandoz, Inc., 813 F. Supp. 2d 569 (S.D.N.Y. 2011). There, however, 
the court rejected the proposed narrowly limited market (two brand and two generic drugs that were a combined oral 
contraceptive and medication to treat premenstrual dysphoric disorder) as implausible given the multitude of other functionally 
and chemically similar drugs on the market designed to treat the same symptoms. That the court recognized in those 
circumstances that the application of cross-elasticity of demand was ""complicated given that (1) patient choice is constrained by 
the physician's prescribing authority, and (2) the impact of price variation may be blunted by the effect of health insurance,"" is 
not surprising. Id. at 578. Similarly, defendants' reliance on Kaiser Found. v. Abbott Labs., No. CV02-2443-JFWFMOX, 2009 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 107512, 2009 WL 3877513, at *8 (C.D. Cal. Oct. 8, 2009) is misplaced. There, essentially identical drugs 
(alpha-blockers) were reasonably interchangeable, yet plaintiff's expert excluded them from the market for the sole and 
erroneous reason that those drugs were not ""comparable therapeutic substitutes."" "
1794,37," The differences between Lidoderm and some of the other drugs that Gilligan and Bell assume are equivalent (e.g., ibuprofen) 
is obvious even without expert testimony."
1794,38," Defendants cite one case where cross-elasticity was explicitly not required, primarily because that analysis was not feasible. 
See Nobody in Particular Presents, Inc. v. Clear Channel Commc'ns, Inc., 311 F. Supp. 2d 1048, 1082 (D. Colo. 2004) (""whether 
reasonable interchangeability can be determined for antitrust purposes without economic analysis of cross-elasticity of demand. 
Although the Tenth Circuit has not addressed this specific issue, . . . the court finds that a plaintiff may, through sufficient 
evidence of other indicia of market definition, define a relevant market without economic study of cross-elasticity of demand, 
especially when economic analysis of cross-elasticity of demand is infeasible based on pricing data.""). As discussed below, 
there is no evidence that an economic analysis of cross-elasticity of demand was infeasible, but only that defendants did not 
seek the data to do it."
1794,39," Plaintiffs rely on these ""practical indicia"" to support their argument that the market should include only Lidoderm and its 
generics, focusing on Endo and Teikoku's representations to the market and to the FTC about the ""uniqueness"" of Lidoderm as 
the only lidocaine hydrogel patch on the market. See supra. "
1795,40," Defendants appear to argue that Bell did not need to conduct an economic analysis of cross-elasticity of demand because Bell 
did not have access to the data to do so. Def. Oppo to Pl. MSJ at 19-20. However, defendants do not argue or show that the 
data to enable Bell to perform a net price comparison between Lidoderm and other drugs they contend should be in the same 
market was unavailable. They contend only that Bell did not have access to it. Plaintiffs respond that the relevant data could 
have been secured through discovery subpoenas if defendants had wanted to counter plaintiffs' showing. Reply at 9 n.4. "
1796,41," Defendants do not point any evidence, by Bell or otherwise, that increases in the WAC did not generally correlate to increases 
in the net prices for Lidoderm. Instead, defendants note that Bell, when using net prices, concluded that the price increases for 
Lidoderm between May 2012 and September 2013 were not as high percentage-wise as plaintiffs contended. Defs. Oppo. to 
Pls. MPSJ at 22 n.10. They do not dispute net percentage increases occurred. "
1799,42," As noted above, in construction but-for world scenarios, there is a presumption of economical rationality. See, e.g., Dolphin 
Tours, Inc. v. Pacifico Creative Serv., Inc., 773 F.2d 1506, 1511 (9th Cir. 1985) (plaintiffs ""must presume the existence of rational 
economic behavior in the hypothetical free market.""); see also Murphy Tugboat Co. v. Crowley, 658 F.2d 1256, 1262 (9th Cir. 
1981) (""economic rationality must be assumed for all competitors, absent the strongest evidence of chronic irrationality""). "
1800,43," Specifically, plaintiffs seek to exclude paragraphs 13(a), 23-28, 37-50 and 52-57 of the Murthy Report. In 13(a), as an 
example, Murthy opines, ""A generic company will consider many factors when evaluating whether to launch a product 'at risk,' 
including without limitations: (i) the likelihood and timing of obtaining all regulatory approvals; (ii) the likelihood of an adverse litigation outcome (including potential damages based on the magnitude of sales of the branded 
product—which could be trebled—and how an adverse ruling could affect ""first to file"" opportunities); (iii) the company's manufacturing capabilities and ability to meet demand; and (iv) the likelihood and timing of entry of additional generic manufacturers. When evaluating the record relating to these factors, it is my opinion that it is very unlikely that a company in Watson's position 
would have launched a generic version of Endo's Lidoderm patch 'at risk.'"" Murthy Report [Dkt. No. 809-2]."
1800,44," In accordance with my prior Orders, defense experts will only be able to testify as to what ""a reasonable"" company would have 
done when faced with the (disputed) facts in this case, and not what Watson actually knew or was motivated by. See, e.g., June 
6, 2016 Minute Order [Dkt. No. 746] at 1. "
1801,45," Teikoku's motion for leave to file a sur-reply in opposition to plaintiffs' motion to exclude the Schaede testimony [Dkt. No. 885] 
is GRANTED. I have considered the arguments made by Teikoku in that Sur-Reply, as well as the responses made by plaintiffs' 
in their Opposition to the Motion for Leave. Dkt. No. 887."
1801,46," See, e.g., Paladin Assocs., Inc. v. Montana Power Co., 328 F.3d 1145, 1158 (9th Cir. 2003) (elements of a Section two claim 
are: ""(1) the existence of a combination or conspiracy to monopolize; (2) an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy; (3) the 
specific intent to monopolize; and (4) causal antitrust injury.""). "
1802,47," Plaintiffs are not, as in many of the cases cited by Teikoku, attempting a second ""bite at the apple"" after losing on an issue at 
summary judgment. See, e.g., Venture Corp. v. Barrett, No. 5:13-cv-03384-PSG, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 59477, at *11 (N.D. Cal. 
May 5, 2015); cf. Guzik Tech. Enters. v. W. Digitial Corp., No. 5:11-cv-03786-PSG, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 171327, at *28 (N.D. 
Cal. Nov. 22, 2013). (denying motion in limine seeking to preclude claim of infringement by importation as ""thinly-veiled"" 
dispositive motion, but granting motion in limine to preclude evidence regarding willfulness, despite failure to seek summary 
judgment ton that issue, where willfulness was irrelevant as a matter of law). Nor are they seeking to exclude testimony on the 
ground that it was inadequately disclosed where there were other more appropriate remedies (e.g., motions to compel). See, 
e.g., Nortek Air Sols., LLC v. Energy Lab Corp., No. 14-cv-02919-BLF, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 92468, at *6 (N.D. Cal. July 15, 
2016)."
1802,48," Given the apparent lack of case law supporting Teikoku's position (that its benign intent is a defense under the rule of reason), 
Teikoku takes a different tack, arguing that judicial estoppel prevents plaintiffs from arguing intent is not relevant. Teikoku Opp. 
to Schaede at 7-9. However, that pro-competitive justifications are relevant (e.g., where a generic manufacturer provides 
distribution services) and anti-competitive justifications are relevant (e.g., defendants were paying for delay of generic entry) 
does not mean that other justifications that have nothing to do with competition are relevant. Plaintiffs' repeated efforts to force 
Teikoku (or have me force Teikoku) to produce attorney-client information in discovery to uncover Teikoku's true purposes for 
entering the Agreement does not estop plaintiffs from arguing that the Schaede testimony is irrelevant. "
1803,49," For similar reasons, even though the plaintiffs did not move to exclude it, testimony from Moffitt about ""maintaining a good 
business relationship"" as a ""traditional settlement consideration"" will not be allowed. Moffitt Rep. ¶¶ 72-73."
1803,50," Defendants are correct that Adelman was not emphatic about what a reasonable factfinder/Judge Sleet/the Federal Circuit 
would have done on anticipation, but he was clear about what ""the courts"" should have (in the case of Judge Sleet) or would 
have (in the case of the Federal Circuit) done with respect to obviousness based on the record in the underlying case. See id. at 
155 (responding to the question of whether ""court"" included reasonable factfinder or Judge Sleet: A. I did not make that distinction. So I was talking about the -- really the courts, including the Federal Circuit. And in that, I'm 
assuming that the Federal Circuit would look at it as — the same as KSR. And I would have expected Judge Sleet to do the 
same. But that doesn't always happen. A. I'm offering the opinion that he should have, and the combination [**119]  of Judge Sleet and the Federal Circuit would 
have, under these facts, these -- and every one of these cases is different -- that, as I said before, the evidence is 
overwhelming on obviousness, and I believe it is on inequitable conduct. Adelman Depo. Tr. at 154-55. "
1804,51," Even if Judge Sleet's credibility comments were as strong and set in stone as defendants contend, defendants do not explain 
how they would impact obviousness (which is determined as a matter of law)."
1804,52," Plaintiffs also argue that the ""background"" references included in Shah's Report were not limited to the '529 technology but 
were also relevant to Shah's opinions on the Rolf patents. Adelman & Shah Oppo. at 9. Defendants do not address or contest 
this position in their Reply. "
1806,53," Hardigan describes himself as ""an independent consultant"" who is an executive and advisor to companies that engage in IP 
litigation with over 15 years of experience. He has been personally responsible for investment in and management of over 50 
U.S. patent cases and has provide a range of IP advisory services to attorneys, Fortune 500 companies, and institutional 
investors engaged in patent licensing, patent transactions, and patent litigation. Hardigan Report [Dkt. No. 785-2] ¶ 1.1."
1806,54," Defendants do not argue that no efficiencies would flow from the '529 litigation to the Rolf litigation, but because that the same 
product (5% lidocaine patches) was involved, the same counsel were involved, and the same court was involved certainly there 
would be some. How many and how significant those efficiencies may have been can be tested at trial. "
1807,55," The full exchange at issue reads: Q. From any of this literature, did you, for lack of a better term, ""pluck off"" the shelf a model and implement it here in this 
report? . . . THE WITNESS: [**132]  No. The details of these would be very, very specific to the situation so the answer is no in the 
sense I think you're asking the question. If you mean just in a more conceptual sense of considering the gains from litigation 
and then considering the gains from settlement, then the answer is yes, but not specifically grabbing an existing set of 
analyses and changing a number here or there. Leffler Depo. Tr. at 184:3-18. "
1809,56," This ruling does not preclude defendants from objecting to and moving to strike particular testimony if Miller asserts 
confidentiality concerns as a basis to refuse to answer questions at trial or if Miller testifies on matters at trial that he refused to 
testify on during his deposition."
1809,57," Miller testified that he had never been involved in setting the amount of product required for product launch. Miller Depo. Tr. at 
59. But in this case, Miller's opinion is based on Watson's own documents indicating various launch date quantity scenarios. His 
lack of direct experience in this area is not problematic."
1809,58," In his Report, Miller gives examples of how Watson could have ""squeezed"" extra ""man-hours"" out of its manufacturing 
process. Miller Report ¶¶ 41, 300-301. As to the two-batches-a-week projection, defendants can attack Miller's basis for 
believing that projection was realistic or actually viable. "
1810,59," Defendants also complain about Molina's testimony regarding defense-expert Murthy's treatment of the patent-litigation risk in 
Murthy's Report. See Molina Reply Rep. ¶¶ 96-102. It is unclear whether Molina or Murthy have experience sufficient to testify 
as to how reasonable companies would weigh patent-risk in deciding to launch, but those objections can be made at trial if that 
sort of testimony is elicited and an appropriate foundation is not laid."
1810,60," See, e.g., Stanley v. Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp., 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 198861 , 2014 WL 12573393, at *6 (C.D.Cal., 
2014), quoting In re Rezulin Products Liability Litigation, 309 F.Supp.2d 531, 547 (S.D.N.Y. 2004) (excluding ""speculative 
inferences"" about defendants' motivations); In re Flonase Antitrust Litigation, 884 F.Supp.2d 184, 193 (E.D.P.A. 2012 (experts 
not permitted to testify as to ""state of mind"" as to why a company filed its citizen petition); In re Fosamax Products Liability 
Litigation, 645 F.Supp.2d 164, 192 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (""To the extent Merck's motion seeks to preclude Dr. Parisian from testifying "
1811,," as to the knowledge, motivations, intent, state of mind, or purposes of Merck, its employees, the FDA, or FDA officials, it is 
GRANTED. Dr. Parisian conceded at the hearing that her regulatory expertise does not give her the ability to read minds. 
Nevertheless, her report is replete with such conjecture.""); see also Siring v. Oregon State Bd. of Higher Educ. ex rel. Eastern 
Oregon University, 927 F.Supp.2d 1069, 1077 (D. Or. 2013) (collecting cases)."
1811,61," Read Report [Dkt. No. 779-2] ¶ 15 (""I have been asked by counsel to review the facts and circumstances concerning the 
disposition of Endo's citizen petition and related amendments, and to render an opinion on whether the purported notification to 
FDA by Watson of the existence of the so-called non-interference provision in the settlement agreement between Endo and 
Watson accelerated FDA's denial of Endo's citizen petition.""). Plaintiffs argue this testimony may not be necessary because 
defendants have no admissible evidence that the FDA knew about the non-interference provision."
1811,62," As part of the background, Read does explain the FDA's internal review process for Citizen Petitions. See generally Read 
Report. Read's discussions about the timing of ANDA approvals is largely contextual and confined to his testimony that Citizen 
Petitions will usually be given a low priority unless there is a pending ANDA and if so, then the resolution of the Citizen Petition 
will typically be hinged to timing for the resolution of the ANDA. Read Report ¶¶ 38, 50. "
1812,63," Read's position in a publicly run agency and the limited nature of his testimony distinguishes him from the expert excluded in 
Gill v. Arab Bank, PLC, 893 F.Supp.2d 523, 541-42 (E.D.C.A. 2012) (excluding testimony from employee of Israeli Security 
Agency as ""[m]uch, if not all, of Mr. Shmilovitch's testimony is based on facts developed through confidential ISA investigations 
and investigatory methods. Any weight to Mr. Shmilovitch's testimony would be excessive in light of plaintiff's inability to 
adequately cross-examine Mr. Shmilovitch as to the basis of his conclusions."")."
1812,64," In their Reply, defendants cite to FDA documents that were produced pursuant to a FOIA request but only received by 
defendants after they filed their initial motion. Defendants argue those documents show that Read was involved in the Endo 
Citizen Petition and had a more active role in shaping the Watson ANDA responses than he recalled in deposition. Read Reply 
[Dkt. No. 840] at 2-5. Plaintiffs have not had an opportunity to respond to the significance (if any) of those documents and 
arguments made by defendants. "
1815,1," United States Soccer Federation Inc. assigns Division I, II, and III designations to professional soccer leagues. The 
designations signify level of play and other qualities about the leagues."
1815,2," The parties declined to present testimony at the hearing; both sides asserted that the Court can decide this motion as a matter 
of law. See October 31, 2017 Hr'g Tr. 72:17-19; 93:14-18."
1815,3," In deciding this motion, the Court has reviewed all submissions of the parties, including expert declarations, the substance of 
which is discussed in the ""II. Discussion."""
1815,4," Although Plaintiff challenges USSF's authority (see October 31, 2017 Hr'g Tr. 15:23-25), Plaintiff has failed to provide sufficient 
evidence for the Court to conclude that Defendant has no authority to regulate divisional designations of men's professional 
soccer leagues in the United States, whether formally through FIFA or informally through the respect and recognition accorded 
by consumers at large. Indeed, Plaintiff acknowledges as much in its Complaint. (See Compl. ¶ 20 (""No professional soccer 
league located in the United States and Canada would have sufficient credibility with fans, sponsors or broadcasters if it were 
not recognized by the USSF and FIFA, and quality professional soccer players would not play for teams in a league in the United 
States that was not recognized by the USSF and FIFA."").) "
1816,5," Plaintiff asserts that USL has ""embraced 'its minor league' status below that of MLS and has entered into various commercial 
arrangements with MLS to serve as its reserve league."" (Compl. ¶ 3.) Thus, Defendant and MLS allegedly have an incentive to 
also benefit USL."
1816,6, The Original NASL has no connection to the current NASL.
1816,7," The Defendant does not own the rights to the games the national teams play in official FIFA and/or Confederation of North, 
Central American and Caribbean Association Football (""CONCACAF"") tournaments. (See Sunil K. Gulati Decl. in Supp. of Def. 
Opp'n to Pl. Mot. (""Gulati Decl."") at 67 n.8, Docket Entry No. 26-1.) "
1817,8," Plaintiff also asserts that USSF maintains various other personal, commercial, and competitive ties with MLS. (See Compl. ¶¶ 
109-16.)"
1817,9," USSF also asserts that some form of classification has always existed, even prior to the implementation of the PLS. (Gulati 
Decl. ¶ 71.) "
1818,10," Plaintiff asserts in the Complaint that the Standard Task Force also recommended that the field size requirement be amended. 
(See Compl. ¶ 140) (""[A]ll teams, rather than 75%, had to have FIFA-approved 70 yards by 110 yards fields[.]"") Defendant 
suggests that this amendment was implemented in 2010. (See Division I and II PLS Amendments Chart (""Amendments Chart""), 
annexed to Gulati Decl. as Ex. 62.)"
1818,11, The Court believes this to be the National Women's Soccer League. 
1819,12," As part of the proposed 2015 amendments, the Standard Task Force recommended eliminating the requirement for operating 
in specific time zones in the continental United States. (See Gulati Decl. at 25-26.) The Board did not vote on the change given 
Plaintiff's complaints about the other proposed amendments. (Id. ¶ 78.)"
1819,13," Plaintiff asserts that the PLS were designed from inception to preclude competition and continue to be applied in that manner. 
(See Compl. ¶¶ 157-74.) In support of its theory, NASL points to the minimum stadium requirement and two player development 
requirements. (Id. ¶ 157.) NASL asserts that the 15,000 minimum seating requirement is anticompetitive because new entrants 
often have difficulty securing stadiums in compliance. (Id. ¶ 159.) Given its status as a Division II or ""minor league,"" NASL has 
struggled to convince government officials to help finance compliant facilities. (Id. ¶¶ 161-62.) NASL further asserts that even the 
English Premier League, a recognized world-class soccer league, could not have satisfied the stadium requirement. (Id. ¶ 164.) 
NASL further asserts that MLS failed to meet this requirement for all its teams from 2009 to 2015. (Id. ¶ 165.) Plaintiff similarly challenges two 2014 Division I PLS player development requirements. The first, dating back to 1995, states that 
""[e]ach U.S.-based team must demonstrate a commitment to a player development program,"" which ""may be satisfied by 
supporting either an amateur or professional reserve team competing in a USSF-sanctioned league or by the league itself."" (Id. ¶ 
167.) The second requirement, dating back to 2008 and building off of the 1995 PLS, states that ""[e]ach U.S.-based team must 
maintain teams and a program to develop players at the youth level,"" which ""may be satisfied by fielding teams in a Federation 
academy program."" (Id.) Plaintiff asserts that non-Division I leagues have great difficulty convincing players and teams to be in a 
""minor league for a minor league."" (Id. ¶¶ 170-71.) Plaintiff, however, has not referred to the development requirements of the 
PLS in its motion papers. "
1820,14," As a direct consequence, Plaintiff asserts that several teams decided to leave the NASL, with several teams joining MLS. 
October 31, 2017 Hr'g Tr. 97:19-25."
1820,15," Plaintiff argues that this, at least in part, was caused by the denial of its 2015 Division I application. October 31, 2017 Hr'g Tr. 
97:19-25."
1820,16," Defendant states that ""team waivers"" are categorically different from ""league waivers."" While league waivers make up the 
""basic foundation of any league,"" team waivers govern less critical issues such as ""coaching license[s],"" need for a ""few hundred 
extra seats,"" and field measurements. See October 31, 2017 Hr'g Tr. 60:16-25. "
1821,17," Defendant asserts that USL has not yet been sanctioned for Division II and therefore no waivers have been granted. October

1821,18," Plaintiff requests the Court find that the denial of an injunction would cause ""extreme"" or ""very serious damage,"" thereby 
relieving Plaintiff of the burden to make a clear showing of entitlement to relief. October 31, 2017 Hr'g Tr. 7:13-8:18. The Second 
Circuit has provided little guidance on what constitutes sufficiently ""extreme"" or ""very serious damage."" However, the Court finds 
instructive the cases involving a ""total loss of business,"" where courts have only found that such total loss was ""irreparable 
harm."" See, e.g., Roso-Lino Beverage Distributors, Inc. v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of New York, 749 F.2d 124, 126 (2d Cir. 
1984); Galvin v. New York Racing Ass'n, 70 F. Supp. 2d 163, 170 (E.D.N.Y.), aff'd sub nom. Galvin v. New York Racing Ass'n, 
Inc., 166 F.3d 1200 (2d Cir. 1998). In addition, in a footnote in Jacobson & Co. v. Armstrong Cork Co., the Second Circuit seems 
to suggest that irreparable harm and extreme or very serious damage are one and the same. 548 F.2d 438, 441 n.3 (2d Cir. 
1977) (""Since it seems to us that 'irreparable harm' is indistinguishable from 'extreme or very serious damage,' we read Clune [v. 
Publishers' Association of New York City, 214 F. Supp. 520 (S.D.N.Y. 1963), aff'd on the opinion below, 314 F.2d 343 (2d Cir. 
1963)] as merely a reaffirmation of the traditional reluctance to issue mandatory injunctions 'in doubtful cases or where the injury 
complained of is capable of compensation in damages.'""). However, the Court notes that the movants in these cases do not 
appear to have requested a finding of ""extreme"" harm. Nevertheless, the Court declines Plaintiff's request and applies the clear 
entitlement to relief standard."
1821,19," In advance of the hearing, the Court notified the parties that it had determined that Plaintiff was seeking a mandatory 
injunction and requested that the parties be prepared to address the higher standard. (Order dated October 29, 2017.) "
1822,20," The Court notes the sometimes inconsistent recitations of the standard. New York ex rel. Schneiderman v. Actavis PLC states 
that the movant must make a ""strong showing"" of irreparable harm and also show that the preliminary injunction is in the public 
interest. 787 F.3d 638, 650 (2d Cir. 2015), cert. dismissed sub nom. Allergan PLC v. New York ex. rel. Schneiderman, 136 S. 
Ct. 581, 193 L. Ed. 2d 421 (2015). The Court finds that Plaintiff has made a strong showing of irreparable harm."
1822,21," The Court recognizes that Defendant has submitted comparisons of NASL teams and USL teams that are not affiliated with 
MLS. However, as noted in the record, there are many other differences that may lead to differing outcomes, including the 
different trajectory of the leagues. See October 31, 2017 Hr'g Tr. 53:6-13. "
1823,22," Defendant cites to various district courts opinions suggesting that the movant must provide ""concrete data"" or ""detailed"" 
financial information when the alleged irreparable harm is the potential destruction of a business. See Auto Sunroof of 
Larchmont, Inc. v. Am. Sunroof Corp., 639 F. Supp. 1492, 1494 (S.D.N.Y. 1986); Christ Gatzonis Elec. Contractor, Inc. v. New 
York City Sch. Const. Auth., No. 93-CV-2418, 1993 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9147, 1993 WL 262715, at *5 (E.D.N.Y. July 2, 1993). 
Although financial data and projections may be most probative of the imminent loss of a business, and may be required in some 
cases, the Court declines to find that such information is always required. Both Auto Sunroof and Christ Gatzonis involved cases 
where the movant only had self-serving statements to support its assertions. By contrast, in the instant action, Defendant itself 
acknowledges that Plaintiff is in financial trouble, and that a league's divisional status may have an impact on its finances. (See 
Compl. ¶ 63; Def. Opp'n to Pl. Mot. (""Def. Opp'n"") at 25, Docket Entry No. 27); October 31, 2017 Hr'g Tr. 53:13. Defendant also argues that the alleged harm is ""a consequence of [Plaintiff's] own making."" See Commodex Sys. Corp. v. GTE 
Telenet Commc'ns Corp., 543 F. Supp. 164, 165 (S.D.N.Y. 1982). But to the extent that the PLS were applied in a discriminatory 
manner, any harm arising from the denial would not be considered ""self-inflicted."" In addition, as Plaintiff asserts, given its 
specific situation, Division III status does not appear to be a viable alternative."
1823,23," Because of the importance of Divisional status to its very business, Plaintiff has also demonstrated irreparable harm based on 
loss in reputation and good will. See Tom Doherty Assocs., Inc. v. Saban Entm't, Inc., 60 F.3d 27, 38 (2d Cir. 1995) (explaining 
loss in goodwill constituting irreparable harm typically involve cases threatening the ""very viability of the plaintiff's business"") 
(citation omitted); (see also Riccardo Silva Reply Decl. in Supp. of Pl. Mot. (""Silva Decl."") ¶¶ 4-5, 8, Docket Entry No. 30-21; 
Capriotti II Reply Decl. in Supp. of Pl. Mot. (""Capriotti II Decl."") ¶¶ 4-5, 8, Docket Entry No. 30-22; Robert J. Watkins Reply Decl. 
in Supp. of Pl. Mot. (""Watkins Decl."") ¶¶ 4-5, 8, Docket Entry No. 30-23.) The Court, however, does not find Plaintiff's claim 
based on the potential loss of ""high-quality player talent and other valuable employees"" to be an independent basis for 
irreparable harm. (Pl. Mem. in Supp. of Pl. Mot. (""Pl. Mem."") 17, Docket Entry No. 3-1.) While loss of high-quality talent, 
especially in a sports setting, may constitute irreparable harm, Plaintiff's proffered evidence is too speculative. In discussing the 
potential loss of players, the NASL owners discussed the possibility, rather than likelihood of harm. (See Silva Decl. ¶ 10 (""many 
of our top players may leave"") (emphasis added); Capriotti II Decl. ¶ 10 (same); Watkins Decl. ¶ 10 (same)); see also Jessup v. 
Am. Kennel Club, Inc., 862 F. Supp. 1122, 1127 (S.D.N.Y. 1994) (""[A] party seeking preliminary injunctive relief must show a 
likelihood of irreparable injury, not a possibility of irreparable injury[.]""). But the potential loss of players, and other complications 
arising with other employees support the concern of loss of business. (See Silva Decl. ¶ 11.) "
1824,24," Although the Plaintiff seeks permanent relief under both Section 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, Plaintiff moves only under 
Section 1 for preliminary injunctive relief. Thus the Court will only address the likelihood of success of the Section 1 claim."
1824,25," The Court rejects Defendant's argument that the alleged conspiracy is ""implausible"" because the PLS predate the Plaintiff, the 
""object of the supposed conspiracy,"" by ""nearly 15 years."" (Def. Opp'n at 14.) This reading of the Complaint fails to consider 
Plaintiff's allegation that the PLS were designed to prevent any competitor from challenging MLS at any time. (See Compl. ¶¶ 
157-74.) A conspiracy that seeks to eliminate all future competition cannot be said to be lawful for lack of a specific target. See 
Associated Press v. United States, 326 U.S. 1, 12, 65 S. Ct. 1416, 89 L. Ed. 2013 (1945) (""Combinations are no less unlawful 
because they have not as yet resulted in restraint.""). ""Trade restraints of this character, aimed at the destruction of competition, 
tend to block the initiative which brings newcomers into a field of business and to frustrate the free enterprise system which it 
was the purpose of the Sherman Act to protect."" Id. at 13-14. Moreover, Plaintiff also asserts that the PLS have been revised 
and applied in a discriminatory fashion favoring MLS. See Allied Tube & Conduit Corp. v. Indian Head, Inc., 486 U.S. 492, 501, 
108 S. Ct. 1931, 100 L. Ed. 2d 497 (1988) (""Concerted efforts to enforce (rather than just agree upon) private product standards 
face more rigorous antitrust scrutiny."") (emphasis in original)."
1824,26," ""Parallel conduct"" refers to the same or substantially similar actions taken by actors on the same level. See SD3, LLC v. Black 
& Decker (U.S.) Inc., 801 F.3d 412, 427 (4th Cir. 2015), as amended on reh'g in part (Oct. 29, 2015) (""A plaintiff establishes 
parallel conduct when it pleads facts indicating that the defendants acted 'similarly.'""), cert. denied, 136 S. Ct. 2485, 195 L. Ed. 
2d 822 (2016). "
1825,27," Plaintiff clarified in its reply its theory on ""concerted action."" (Pl. Reply to Def. Opp'n to Pl. Mot. (""Pl. Reply"") 4-5, Docket Entry 
No. 30.) In its moving papers, failing to provide any direct evidence of a ""meeting of the minds,"" Plaintiff merely alleged that the 
Defendant ""consists of many separate economic actors capable of concerted conduct."" (Pl. Mem. at 19) (emphasis added). 
Plaintiff in a conclusory manner asserted that ""agreements among these parties satisfy the concerted action requirement."" (Id.) 
Given this broad assertion of ""concerted action,"" Plaintiff appears to argue that any agreement involving some combination of 
SUM, USL, MLS, and USSF and the Board members, in addition to the standards, demonstrate concerted action. See October 
31, 2017 Hr'g Tr. 31:7-12 (""I have to show it's a concerted agreement, which I think I have, because the agreements are in the 
standards themselves. And I also allege an agreement with MLS, that's another agreement I allege in USL[.]""). Assuming this is 
Plaintiff's argument, the Court's reasoning regarding both direct and circumstantial evidence would apply with equal force to any 
agreement that Plaintiff may articulate."
1825,28," The Court recognizes that there may be cases where a by-law, rule, regulation or standard is so clearly anticompetitive on its 
face to warrant a finding of an ""agreement"" for purposes of Section 1. In such cases, the anticompetitive principles are written 
into the agreement itself, often involving active participation by horizontal competitors. See Associated Press, 326 U.S. at 11; 
National Collegiate Athletic Ass'n v. Board of Regents, 468 U.S. 85, 94, 104 S. Ct. 2948, 82 L. Ed. 2d 70 (1984). In Associated 
Press, for example, the by-laws at issue specifically ""contained provisions designed to stifle competition."" 326 U.S. at 11. There, 
the district court ""declared that the conditions which old members could impose upon new applicants for membership were 
'plainly designed in the interests of preventing competition', and that the requirement of payments from new members to 
competing old members, 'were also designed to compensate competitors for the loss in value of their membership, arising out of 
the applicant's improved position as a competitor.'"" Id. at 13 n.7. Likewise, in NCAA v. Board of Regents, the NCAA and its 
members entered into an agreement expressly ""limit[ing] the total amount of televised intercollegiate football and the number of 
games that any one team may televise."" 468 U.S. at 94. In addition to expressly limiting output, ""[n]o member [wa]s permitted to 
make any sale of television rights except in accordance with the basic plan."" Id. at 104. These cases indicate that courts may 
impute the existence of an agreement between participants when the agreement on its face is designed to preclude all 
competition or competitors. That is not the case here. The Court also finds North Carolina State Board of Dental Examiners v. F.T.C., cited by Plaintiff, to undermine rather than 
support Plaintiff's case. 717 F.3d 359, 365 (4th Cir. 2013), aff'd, 135 S. Ct. 1101, 191 L. Ed. 2d 35 (2015). In North Carolina "
1826,," State Board of Dental Examiners, the Board at issue regulated the practice of dentistry in North Carolina. Id. at 364. The Board 
""consisted of six licensed dentists, one licensed hygienist, and one 'consumer member.'"" Id. at 365. At issue was the Board's 
collusive actions to exclude all non-dentists from providing ""teeth whitening services."" Id. Because of the status of most of the 
Board members as practicing dentists, they had a ""personal financial interest in excluding non-dentist[s]"" from the market. Id. at 
371. Plaintiff argues that the Fourth Circuit's decision supports a conclusion that ""an agreement among organization members (even 
when it takes the form of a vote) qualifies as concerted action"" and that ""[n]othing more than that agreement is needed to satisfy 
the concerted action requirement."" (See Pl. Letter in response to Def. Sur-reply (""Pl. Letter"") 2, Docket Entry No. 48.) Plaintiff, 
however, cites to the Fourth Circuit's reference to the underlying FTC decision which specified that there was direct evidence of 
a concerted action because ""[o]n several occasions, the Board discussed teeth whitening services provided by non-dentists and 
then voted to take action to restrict these services."" Id. at 373 (emphasis added). The FTC's interpretation of the significance of 
the ""vote ... to restrict [] services"" was informed by the fact that there was a discussion about ""teeth whitening services"" prior to 
the vote. Id. Thus, the vote or outcome in and of itself was not sufficient direct evidence as Plaintiff argues. Unlike the USSF 
Board members, the Board in North Carolina State Board of Dental Examiners met prior to voting, agreed on what action to take, 
and then formalized that action through a vote. The FTC's original opinion fully supports this interpretation. For example, the FTC explained that there was ""direct evidence of 
advance discussion and formal approval by Board members."" In the Matter of the N. Carolina Bd. of Dental Examiners, 152 
F.T.C. 75, 2011 WL 11798452, at *69 (July 14, 2011) (emphasis added). The FTC further found ""significant"" that the ""content . . . 
as well as [the] purpose[] [of the official action taken by the Board] was discussed and unanimously approved by Board 
members in advance."" 2011 FTC LEXIS 137, [WL] at *70 (emphasis added). For example, one of the Board members 
specifically sought help from the Cosmetology Board to ""assist [] in [] efforts regarding non-dentist teeth whitening services."" 
2011 FTC LEXIS 137, [WL] at *51. The Board member then instructed counsel to prepare an article for the Cosmetology Board 
after discussing the issue with Board members. Id. Soon after, the Board had a closed session meeting where they ""formally 
approved"" the course of action. Id. The FTC's opinion suggests that Board members had made an agreement to agree prior to 
the formal vote. Plaintiff has provided no similar direct evidence. To the extent the case can be read to suggest a vote in of itself 
is sufficient direct evidence of an agreement, the Court finds contrary authority more persuasive. See SD3, 801 F.3d at 437."
1826,29," The Court recognizes that parallel action and plus factors are usually used for horizontal agreements (involving restraints 
between competitors) and not vertical agreements (involving restraints between entities at different levels of competition) as 
alleged in this case. However, the Court's analysis of whether the circumstantial evidence demonstrates concerted action would 
have been the same even if the Court did not view the Board votes as parallel conduct. "
1827,30," The Court assigns very little weight to Plaintiff's arguments that Defendant does not employ ""best practices"" based on 
Defendant's failure to publicly disclose its Conflict of Interest handbook and the fact that the current Conflict of Interest policy 
was subject to an editing process or review. (Roger Pielke, Jr. Decl. in Supp. of Pl. Mot. (""Pielke Decl."") ¶¶ 37-38, 42-43, Docket 
Entry No. 30-25 (""However, it is clear that any such proposed changes would be unnecessary if the Policy were considered to be 
consistent with 'best practices.'"").)"
1827,31," The Court acknowledges that Plaintiff also applied informal pressure that is not necessarily part of the official review and 
comment process."
1827,32," See October 31, 2017 Hr'g Tr. 79:21-24 (""And then, finally, you have Mr. Steve Malik, who is an NASL owner. And NASL 
brushes over that. There's no mention of the fact they have an owner on the U.S. Soccer board at the time of the September 
2017 decision.""). "
1829,33," Defendant has not provided a rationale for why strengthening Division I and II requirements would help decrease the number 
of waivers that are granted."
1829,34, The Court construes Alan Rothenberg's statements cited by Plaintiff in a similar manner. (See Compl. ¶ 72.) 
1830,35, Plaintiff has also been given the opportunity to directly voice its concerns to the PLS Task Force. (See Gulati Decl. ¶¶ 155-56.) 
1832,36," Defendant did not address the relevant market in its opposition to the motion and, despite the Court notifying the parties at the 
hearing that it determined the relevant market to be the (1) top-tier and (2) second-tier men's professional soccer leagues in the 
United States and Canada, Defendant did not address it at the hearing. Instead, Defendant in its sur-reply provided another 
declaration from its expert witness restating his earlier testimony. The new affidavit appears to provide no additional information 
on this issue and the Court declines to consider it."
1832,37," Cross-elasticity of demand exists if (1) the increase in the price of one product causes (2) a corresponding increase in demand 
for a substitute product. (See Stefan Szymanski Decl. in Supp. of Pl. Mot. (""Szymanski Decl."") ¶ 27, Docket Entry No. 3-3.) A 
high cross-elasticity of demand suggests that consumers consider the products to be interchangeable substitutes, indicating that 
the products should be grouped into the same relevant market. (See id.)"
1832,38," ""Under the HMT, [a] market is any grouping of sales whose sellers, if unified by a hypothetical cartel or merger, could 
profitably raise prices significantly above the competitive level."" United States v. Am. Express Co., 838 F.3d 179, 198-99 (2d Cir. 
2016) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). ""If the sales of other producers substantially constrain the price-increasing 
ability of the hypothetical cartel, these others are part of the market."" Id. (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). "
1833,39," Demand for the market allegedly comes from ""teams/owners/promoters wishing to play in these forms of season-long, league-
based competition."" (Szymanski Decl. ¶ 37.)"
1833,40," The Court also accepts for the purposes of deciding this motion Plaintiff's assertion that there are no reasonable substitutes to 
the proposed relevant market (including Division III). (See Compl. ¶¶ 39-45; Szymanski Decl. at 18-22.); see also Irish Lesbian & 
Gay Org. v. Giuliani, 143 F.3d 638, 644 (2d Cir. 1998) (""Ordinarily, findings of fact and conclusions of law made in a preliminary 
injunction proceeding do not preclude reexamination of the merits at a subsequent trial."")."
1833,41," Plaintiff asserts that the PLS have harmed competition in the relevant market by (1) causing consumer confusion (Szymanski 
Decl. ¶¶ 66-67), (2) reducing output by discouraging potential entrants (Szymanski Decl. ¶ 69), and (3) decreasing consumer 
choice (Pl. Reply at 10 n.21; see also Pl. Mem. at 22.) However, Plaintiff's expert undercuts Plaintiff's argument about consumer 
confusion. As the expert explained, ""it is very easy for fans to gain experience and realize product quality quickly."" (Szymanski 
Decl. ¶ 67.) Even if Defendant's designations are misleading, Plaintiff's argument would suggest that fans would be able to "
1834,," quickly determine if they were arbitrary or not. Here, Plaintiff has also failed to provide empirical evidence of actual confusion. 
See also MacDermid Printing Sols. LLC v. Cortron Corp., 833 F.3d 172, 186-87 (2d Cir. 2016) (""There is no evidence that even 
a single customer was actually misled . . . [a]nd even if [Defendant's actions] did mislead some customers . . . [such] actions that 
'merely interfere with the consumer's freedom of choice in deciding' whether to buy a product are insufficient to support an 
antitrust claim, absent any further showing of 'demonstrable, anti-competitive impact.'"") (citation omitted). Plaintiff also fails to 
provide actual evidence of a reduction in output other than NASL's own exclusion. (See Szymanski Decl. ¶ 69 (""The use of 
arbitrary criteria to designate league quality is likely to reduce output."") (emphasis added).) ""In order to fulfill this requirement, the 
plaintiff must show more than just that he was harmed by defendants' conduct."" K.M.B. Warehouse Distributors, Inc. v. Walker 
Mfg. Co., 61 F.3d 123, 127 (2d Cir. 1995). Lastly, the Second Circuit discussed a reduction in consumer choice in the context of 
indirect evidence of actual harm as a potential ""other ground"" necessary in addition to market power. See MacDermid, 833 F.3d 
at 183 & n.42. "
1835,42, The Court recognizes that Plaintiff asserts that the market itself best dictates the minimum.
1835,43," See October 31, 2017 Hr'g Tr. 41:4-11 (""Finally, on our rebuttal burden, on less restrictive alternative, the biggest less 
restrictive alternative on issues like size of teams, number of teams, size of stadium which is not an issue on this motion but it is 
an issue generally, time zones, is let the marketplace decide.""). "
1836,44," The Court recognizes that there are other parts of the PLS for which Plaintiff does not provide a less restrictive alternative. 
However, Plaintiff's 2018 application for Division II was denied on the basis of Plaintiff's failure to meet the minimum team and 
time zone requirements."
1836,45," While the Division I requirement has always required at least ten teams, USSF gave MLS waivers when MLS only had eight 
teams. October 31, 2017 Hr'g Tr. 43:5-8. "
1844,1," Enterprise Software is a type of computer software program that enables core operational tasks - like payroll, human resource 
tasking, and inventory management - across an entire organization. Instead of being tied to a specific computer, Enterprise 
Software is hosted on a server and provides simultaneous access and service to a large number of users over a computer 
network. These features and functions are in contrast to typical computer software, which is generally a single-user application 
executed on a user's personal computer. A key feature of Enterprise Software is the ability to modify and customize the software 
for an entity's specific needs and to support the software through periodic updates to maintain the software's continuing 
functionality and compliance with regulatory and tax changes. "
1845,2," Oracle hosts several different websites on which Oracle offers various software updates, patches, and other software support 
materials and documentation for licensees of Oracle's software. These support websites are made available to licensees through 
client logins which allow the licensees to access the websites and download particular fixes and support materials for the 
licensee's particular licensed Oracle software application. "
1847,3," The Federal CFAA prohibits ""[a]cts of computer trespass by those who are not authorized users or who exceed authorized 
use."" Facebook, Inc. v. Power Ventures, Inc., 844 F.3d 1058, 1065 (9th Cir. 2015). Specifically, the CFAA imposes criminal 
and civil liability for ""intentionally access[ing] a protected computer without authorization, and as a result of such conduct, 
caus[ing] damage and loss."" 18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(5)(C). Similarly, California's CDAFA, found at California Penal Code § 502, 
imposes criminal and civil liability on any person who ""[k]nowingly accesses and without authorization takes, copies, or makes 
use of any data from a computer, computer system, or computer network, or takes or copies any supporting documentation, 
whether existing or residing internal or external to a computer, computer system, or computer network"" or ""[k]nowingly and 
without permission uses or causes to be used computer services."" CAL. PENAL CODE § 502(c)(2) - (3). Finally, the NCCL also 
imposes criminal and civil liability on ""a person who knowingly, willfully and without authorization . . . [o]btains or attempts to 
obtain, permit access to or causes to be accessed . . . a program or any supporting documents which exist inside or outside a 
computer, system or network"" or ""who knowingly, willfully, and without authorization . . . [o]btains or attempts to obtain access to, 
permit access to or causes to be accessed . . . a computer, system or network."" NEV. REV. STAT. §§ 205.4765(1) & (3); NEV. 
REV. STAT. § 205.511(1). "
1848,4," The court finds that the ruling in Facebook would be equally applicable to the NCCL which prohibits similar conduct to that 
prohibited by the CAFA and CDAFA."
1848,5," Facebook, Inc., 944 F.3d 1058, 1067 (""Once permission has been revoked, technological gamesmanship or the enlisting of a 
third party to aid in access will not excuse liability.""). "
1852,6," In its third amended complaint Rimini Street does identify one customer, Yanmar, who chose to not engage in a new support 
service contract with Rimini Street. See ECF No. 487, ¶ 50. However, the alleged misrepresentations made to Yanmar were 
made by a non-party, Oracle Corporation Japan, a separate and distinct entity from the named Oracle defendants. Rimini Street 
has not brought suit against this separate corporate entity, nor has Rimini Street alleged any agency or control over the actions 
of Oracle Corporation Japan by the named Oracle defendants. Thus, this allegation is insufficient to support Rimini Street's claim 
for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage. "

Counterclaims. Dkt. No. 97. Qualcomm reasserted its Counterclaims as stated in the Answer filed in Dkt. No. 70. Id. at 75."
1862,4," Apple asks the Court to take judicial notice of an article quoted in Qualcomm's Counterclaims titled Apple's Chip Choices May 
Leave Some iPhone Users in Slow Lane. RJN, Dkt. No. 77-2 (requesting judicial notice of Schlabach Decl., Ex. 1). Qualcomm 
argues that this request should be denied as moot because Apple has misconstrued their UCL claim as a fraud-based claim. 
Opp-1 at 9. The Court will take judicial notice of this document. See Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 568 n.13, 127 S. 
Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007) (""the District Court was entitled to take notice of the full contents of the published articles 
referenced in the complaint, from which the truncated quotations were drawn.""). "
1863,5," The heightened pleading requirement of Rule 9(b) does not apply as to this theory. See Vess, 317 F.3d at 1104. "
1866,6," In the 2007 case Lozano, the Ninth Circuit declined to apply the FTC test in the ""absence of a clear holding from the California 
Supreme Court."" 504 F.3d at 736. This Court will accordingly decline to apply the three-pronged test contained in the FTC Act. 
See id. The Court recognizes that some district courts have found the FTC test provides useful guidance in the consumer 
context. See Zuniga v. Bank of America N.A., No. Cv 14-06471-MWF, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 177076, 2014 WL 7156403, at *6 
(C.D. Cal., Dec. 9, 2014) (""the Court believes that Camacho provides the best guidance on the issue and the adapted three-
prong FTC Act test should be applied to determine whether a business practice is unfair under the UCL.""). However, the test 
appears to be of limited use in the instant case where the relevant parties are two businesses with an ongoing relationship. See 
Camacho v. Automobile Club of Southern California, 142 Cal. App. 4th 1394, 1403, 48 Cal. Rptr. 3d 770 (2006) (adopting FTC 
Section 5 test in part because the test is ""on its face geared to consumers and is for that reason appropriate in consumer

1868,7," Qualcomm argues that Apple's unfair conduct harmed consumers by negatively impacting network efficiency and reducing data 
download resources, thereby harming all ""who depend[ ] on the cellular industry."" Counterclaims ¶ 386; Opp-1 at 18-19. Here, it 
is harm to Qualcomm that matters, not the harm to consumers. Given that the ""immoral, unethical, oppressive, unscrupulous, or 
substantially injurious to consumers"" language usually arises in the context of consumer UCL claims, rather than a commercial 
supplier claim, the Court will assume that the test is meant to assess the harm to the primary victim of the alleged unfair conduct. 
Qualcomm appears to agree that its harm as a supplier because of any impact on consumer demand is the relevant inquiry 
here. Dkt. No. 162 at 51-52. "
1869,8," The Court recognizes that California Courts have stated that the determination of whether conduct is unfair ""usually cannot be 
made on demurrer."" McKell, 142 Cal. App. 4th 1457, 1473, 49 Cal. Rptr. 3d 227. However, the Court's conclusion that the threat 
not to do business theory does not state a claim under the unfair competition law represents a conclusion of law rather than the 
sort of factual finding that cannot be resolved by a motion to dismiss. See Gregory, 104 Cal. App. 4th at 857. See also Bardin, 
136 Cal. App. 4th at 1271 n.6 (affirming dismissal at demurrer stage where complaint was devoid of facts that showed ""immoral, 
unethical, oppressive, unscrupulous, or substantially injurious to consumers""). In addition, in federal court the plaintiff must meet 
higher pleading standards under Twombly and Iqbal to state a claim for relief that is ""plausible"" on its face. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 
U.S. at 678. With regard to Apple's alleged marketing campaign threat, Qualcomm does not allege any well-pleaded facts 
sufficient to support the theory. "
1870,9," Apple's citation to Aspex Eyewear, Inc v. Vision Services Plan, 389 F. App'x 664, 666 (9th Cir. 2010) similarly does not show 
that the legislature has ""clearly permit[ted]"" threats similar to Apple's conduct. An unpublished memorandum disposition, even if 
persuasive, does not establish what the legislature ""clearly permits."" Similarly, Apple has not shown that any First Amendment 
right to commercial speech under Bolger v. Youngs Drug Prods. Corp., 463 U.S. 60, 69, 103 S. Ct. 2875, 77 L. Ed. 2d 469 
(1983) would ""clearly permit"" a retaliatory marketing campaign. "
1872,10," Federal Circuit law governs the inquiry into the existence of a declaratory judgment ""case or controversy."" MedImmune, Inc. v. 
Centocor, Inc., 409 F.3d 1376, 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2005), overruled on other grounds, 549 U.S. 118, 127 S. Ct. 764, 166 L. Ed. 2d 
604 (2007); Applera Corp. v. Michigan Diagnostics, 594 F. Supp. 2d 150 (D. Mass. 2009). "
1874,11," Apple cites to HP, 587 F.3d at 1362 for the proposition that ""[t]he purpose of a declaratory judgment action cannot be defeated 
simply by the stratagem of a correspondence that avoids the magic words such as 'litigation' or 'infringement.'"" While the Court 
recognizes this principle, a holistic look at the licensing correspondence does not indicate, in the Court's view, threatening 
language from Qualcomm. "
1875,12," Qualcomm has also filed suit against Apple in an International Trade Commission case. This case similarly does not assert the 
Additional Patents-in-Suit and the Court will similarly afford minimal weight to this suit. See Opp-2 at 14 n.9. "
1876,13," The Court observes, as Apple suggests, that this case was decided under the ""reasonable apprehension"" standard. 
Nonetheless, this case continues to have persuasive value as a factually analogous case and because ""reasonable 
apprehension"" may still be considered under the MedImmune test. "
1877,14," The Contract Manufacturers are indemnified by Apple. See, e.g., Case No: 17-cv-1010, Dkt. Nos. 66-79 (third party complaints 
by the CMs impleading Apple as a Third Party Defendant on the basis of indemnification). "
1879,15," Qualcomm also argues that the CMs have not adequately alleged that all of the Additional Patents-in-Suit are actually covered 
by the SULAs. Qualcomm argues that many of the SULAs are likely ""not licensed"" if the CM's allegations are taken as true. 
Under the SULAs, a patent is licensed if it is [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] Reply-3 at 5. The Court finds this argument 
unpersuasive as it relies on the assumption that the Additional Patents are not standard essential. Indeed, Qualcomm has 
denied the allegations that each patent was not essential. See, e.g., Dkt. No. 117 (""Qualcomm denies the allegations in 
Paragraph 561"")."
1879,16," Pursuant to the License Agreement, Verance had agreed to pay Digimarc royalties for a ""worldwide, non-exclusive, 
nontransferable ... non-sublicensable license under the Licensed Digimarc Patents to make, have made, use, import, sell and 
offer to sell Licensed Products and Services within the Fields of Use."" Licensed Digimarc Patents encompassed ""all patents 
issued, patent applications filed and patent claims owned by Digimarc"" as of April 2002. Licensed Products and Services were 
specific Verance products ""developed by or for Verance and as to which right, title and interest are primarily owned by Verance."" 
2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 58788, [WL] at *1. The court observed that no provision made royalty payments contingent on validity or 
noninfringement. Id."
1879,17," In MedImmune the language of the relevant license required petitioner to pay royalties on sales of ""Licensed Products,"" a term 
defined as a specified antibody where ""the manufacture, use or sale of which . . . would, if not licensed under th[e] Agreement, 
infringe one or more claims of either or both of [the covered patents] which have neither expired nor been held invalid by a court 
or other body of competent jurisdiction from which no appeal has been or may be taken."" MedImmune, 549 U.S. at 122 
(emphasis added). "
1880,18," Royalties under that license were determined by Net Sales, which were defined in part by the ""Licensed Product"" definition. Id."
1880,19," Further, Powertech does not reverse the basic premise of Verance that no declaratory judgment jurisdiction exists—because 
the legal relationship between the parties is not affected—when royalty payments are not contingent on patent invalidity or 
noninfringement. Indeed, in a post-Powertech decision issued in May 2015 the Court in Miotox cited both Verance and 
Powertech to assess whether the license agreement in that case was contingent on patent invalidity and infringement. While it is 
true that Verance included a citation to the district court decision in Powertech as an example of a case finding that the license 
was not contingent, its rationale was not based merely on the district court decision in Powertech, but rather on years of caselaw 
emphasizing that declaratory judgment jurisdiction should only be brought where the dispute ""touch[es] the legal relations of the 
parties having adverse legal interests."" Verance, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 58788, 2011 WL 2182119, at *3, 6 (citing MedImmune, 
549 U.S. at 127)."
1880,20," In Powertech, whether royalty payments were tied to patent coverage or patent validity turned on legal disputes requiring 
contract interpretation. Id. at 1309. See also Powertech, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53621, 2010 WL 2194829, at *3 (district court 
decision interpreting the term ""hereunder"" in the license agreement and declining to consider parole evidence). Specifically, "
1881,," Powertech argued that legal necessity compelled an interpretation that royalty payments would be tied to patent coverage or 
patent validity and that it would be patent misuse to require payment on royalties that did not infringe. Id. The Federal Circuit 
declined to address the issue leaving this ""merits-based argument"" to the district court to consider on remand. "
1882,21," Qualcomm has not challenged declaratory judgment jurisdiction as to the nine Original Patents-in-Suit. See Dkt. No. 162 at 72, 
78. As a result, unlike in other cases where the declaratory judgment decision was an all-or-nothing determination, here the nine 
Original Patents-in-Suit will still be litigated in this Court. A claim construction hearing has been set for March 22, 2018. "
1886,1," Unless otherwise specified, 2G refers to GSM, GPRS, and EDGE, 3G refers to W-CDMA, and 4G refers to LTE and LTE 
advanced standards."
1886,2," TCL's complaint contained a cause of action for breach of contract, here the ETSI third party obligation. (Docket No. 31, 
Second Amended Complaint, First Cause of Action.) However, the Court granted summary judgment on the claim as to 
damages only in light of TCL's discovery defaults with regard to damages. (Docket No. 1061.)"
1886,3," The claims here are framed by the following pleadings in Case No. SACV14-341: TCL's Second Amended Complaint (Docket 
No. 31), Ericsson's Answer, Defenses and Counterclaims (Docket No. 59), and TCL's Reply (Docket No. 66), as well as the "
1887,," following pleadings in Case No. CV 15-2370: Ericsson's First Amended Complaint (Docket No. 17), TCL's Answer, Affirmative 
Defenses, and Counterclaims (Docket No. 22), and Ericsson's Amended Answer and Affirmative Defenses to TCL's 
Counterclaims (Docket No. 52). However, the only claims tried were the parties' respective claims for breach of contract and 
declaratory relief regarding Ericsson's compliance with its FRAND obligation and declaratory relief for determination of FRAND 
rates. The parties' respective claims regarding infringement, invalidity, and other substantive patent defenses were previously 
stayed. (See Docket No. 1448-1, p. 3.)"
1887,4," The royalty rates determined by the Court will also form the basis for the calculation of a release payment from TCL to Ericsson 
to compensate for TCL's prior unlicensed use of Ericsson's patents."
1887,5," Although the court has labeled its final section as Conclusions of Law and so by implication the remainder are Findings of Fact, 
these labels are only applied to aid in understanding the opinion. See Tri—Tron Int'l v. A.A. Velto, 525 F.2d 432, 435-36 (9th 
Cir.1975) (""We look at a finding or a conclusion in its true light, regardless of the label that the district court may have placed on 
it.... [T]he findings are sufficient if they permit a clear understanding of the basis for the decision of the trial court, irrespective of 
their mere form or arrangement"") (citations omitted); In re Bubble Up Delaware, Inc., 684 F.2d 1259, 1262 (9th Cir.1982) (""The 
fact that a court labels determinations 'Findings of Fact' does not make them so if they are in reality conclusions of law."")."
1887,6," The parties have filed extensive evidentiary objections, some of which the Court ruled on during the trial. (E.g., Docket Nos. 
1378, 1494, 1497, 1507, 1571, 1627, 1635, 1638.) Where evidence is cited, the Court overrules all objections. With regard to the 
balance of the objections, the Court does not rely on those matters and the objections are moot. "
1888,7," Unless otherwise noted, docket number reference as to Case No. SACV 14-341 JVS DFM. "
1889,8," End user terminals are defined in Options A and B to include handsets (feature phones and smartphones) and tablets. (Ex. 458 
at 2; Ex. 459 at 2.) In this Order, the Court uses the terms ""end user terminal,"" ""handset,"" ""cell phone,"" and ""device"" 
interchangeably. "
1890,9," For the ease of readers, when the Court cites to the ETSI IPR Policy or ETSI Guide on IPRs it will cite to both the documents' 
internal section numbering and the trial exhibit number. "
1891,10," ETSI's process does not assess whether declared patents actually are essential. This leads to a substantial over-declaration 
of patents. As discussed below in Part 2, Section IV.B.2, this is an issue where an SEP holder's share of an aggregate royalty is 
based in whole or in part on patent counting. "
1893,11," For example, Dr. Leonard only used United States patents in his survey of SEPs. And Dr. Kakaes looked only to English 
language patents in his work. "
1896,12," TCL creates a blended 2G/3G rate, which necessarily means that its 2G-only devices would be subject to the same 5% total 
aggregate royalty, although it provides no similar statements from Ericsson regarding 2G. However, Ericsson does not dispute 
that if 5% is an appropriate total aggregate royalty figure for 3G, it is also an appropriate total aggregate royalty for 2G. The 
Court therefore accepts that 5% is appropriate total aggregate royalty for both standards. "
1897,13," This reason also requires the Court to find that the announced rates are implicitly for multi-mode devices. A 4G multi-mode 
device, for example, can use 4G, 3G, or 2G networks. (Parkvall Decl. ¶ 22.) Backwards compatibility is especially important 
when a standard is first adopted so that carriers and consumers can continue using existing products and gradually transition to 
newer standards. If the rates Ericsson and others announced in their press release were for single-mode devices, it would 
undermine an important advantage of LTE over WiMAX, and would create obvious stacking issues if these companies actually 
expected to add the 4G total aggregate royalty to the 3G total aggregate royalty and multiple 2G total aggregate royalties. 
(Brismark Decl. ¶ 39.) "
1899,14," The Court therefore finds that Ericsson's P08333 family and corresponding U.S. Pat. No. 5,991,330 (""330 patent"") are not 
essential to the 3G standard. Ericsson makes additional arguments for why the '330 patent is essential to the 3G standard, 
(Cason Rebuttal Decl. ¶¶ 24-28), but since Ericsson cannot identify a required part of the standard covered by this patent, the 
Court has no basis to find this patent essential."
1899,15," The patent census involved extracting the declarations of essentiality from the ETSI database. (Kakaes Decl. ¶ 318.) There 
were 1800 declarations submitted to ETSI, representing 119,850 patents and applications. (Id.) ETSI rules also specify that the 
FRAND commitment applies to all members of that patent family, unless a specific exclusion has been made. (ETSI IPR Policy § 
6.2, Ex. 223 at 2.) Based on International Patent Documentation Center data, this added an additional 34,030 patents to the 
census. (Kakaes ¶ 319.) "
1900,16," Given the somewhat subjective nature of these determinations, ""disagreements"" is probably a more accurate label than 
""error."""
1900,17," Dr. Kakaes and Dr. Jayant also conducted an essentiality analysis on Ericsson's patents to determine the appropriate 
numerator (see Part 2 Section IV.B.2 below). This led to 55 patent families that were analyzed both by Dr. Kakaes and Dr. 
Jayant for the numerator, and Concur IP for the denominator. This therefore provides a useful cross-check on Concur IP's 
results. Of the 55 patent families that were analyzed twice, everyone reached the same conclusion on 41 of them, meaning they 
initially agreed roughly 75% of the time. (Kakaes Decl. ¶ 345.) Of those 14 families where they disagreed, Dr. Kakaes provides 
an explanation for 4 of the disagreements that are unrelated to the substance of Concur IP's analysis. (Id. ¶¶ 346-48.) One of 
them was explained because Ericsson's claim chart is broader than the declaration it submitted to ETSI, one was because of an 
inconsistency related to ETSI's database, and two errors were because Dr. Kakaes examined the file history, which showed that 
the patents were not essential. (Id.) Of the remaining ten disagreements, seven occurred when Dr. Kakaes or Dr. Jayant found 
the patent essential and Concur IP did not, and three where Concur IP found the patent essential and Dr. Kakaes or Dr. Jayant 
did not. (Id. ¶ 349.) This provides an error rate for Concur of 7/51 (13.7%) in favor of non-essentiality, and 3/51(5.8%) in favor of 
essentiality. These results are remarkably similar to Dr. Ding's, who checked 442 of Concur IP's assessments and found error 
results of 11.8% and 4.4% respectively. (Ding Decl. ¶¶ 64, 68.) "
1901,18," A patent pool is a vehicle for collecting and licensing a group of patents held by multiple owners. The business of a patent pool 
is to license rather than practice the patents."
1901,19," In addition, Concur IP conducted a similar study for another company, which allowed them to work much more quickly than if 
they were doing this for the first time. (TT Feb. 17, 2017, pp. 99:21-100:10.)"
1901,20," The Court also notes an inherent tension in Ericsson's position on essentiality. It criticizes Concur IP for finding too many 
patent family essential because they ignored things such as the file history, but Ericsson itself initially claimed that it owned 235 
essential patent families (Kakaes Decl. ¶ 95) and at trial only argued that it owned 179 essential patent families. The Court gives "
1902,," little weight to Ericsson's criticisms when it appears to have made the same errors despite spending 50-80 hours assembling 
claim charts and employing an extensive review process involving multiple patent attorneys. (McLeroy Decl. ¶ 10.)"
1902,21, The numbers do not total 53 because some patents cover multiple standards. 
1903,22, The numbers do not total 63 because some patents cover more than one standard. 
1904,23," The Court actually suspects that Ericsson will be less successful in obtaining future 4G patents than its current proportional 
share of 4G SEPs suggests because 4G LTE is based on 2G GSM, so some of Ericsson's 4G SEPs reflect investments in 
research and development Ericsson made years ago"
1904,24," The ETSI IPR Policy does not oblige its members to act in violation of national laws or regulations, except where derogation 
by agreement between the parties is permitted."
1904,25," Doing so required the Court to assume that each patent expires at the end of the month, and to treat the license as if it started 
on May 1, 2017 and ended on May 1, 2022. A patent that expired May 2017 would therefore have 1 month of validity, while a 
patent that expired April 2022 would have 60 months of validity. Both of these assumptions very slightly favor Ericsson 
(generally less than 1%), but the Court believes these assumptions are justified in view of TCL's failure to justify its own 
expiration calculations, as well as the simplicity they add to the calculations. "
1907,26," However, Ericsson's critiques would be stronger had Dr. Parkvall gone through more of Dr. Kakaes's alternatives and shown 
that they were inferior, impossible, or infringing. Dr. Parkvall instead testified that he did not go through most of Dr. Kakaes's 
alternatives because he ""found his methodology such flawed and not a good one, I didn't see the point in wasting time trying to 
check each of his gradings."" (TT Mar. 1, 2017, pp. 77:25-78:2.)"
1907,27," Because the importance scores were ultimately irrelevant, the Court need not discuss the validity of TCL's attempt to quantify 
the importance of Ericsson's SEPs. "
1908,28," For these reasons, the Court finds it unnecessary to create a separate rate for TCL's definition of the Asia-Pacific region, 
which excludes China. The entire region is less than 2% of TCL's total sales, and Ericsson's patent strength in that region is 
sufficiently close to China's for all standards that accounting for it separately would likely have less impact than a rounding error. 
(Ex. 1122.) "
1914,29," ETSI was concerned about the availability of arbitration to small firms in deterring discrimination. (Ex. 5289 at 4, 6.) However, 
an arbitration scheme was never adopted. "
1915,30," TCL appears to have dropped ZTE from its list of similarly situated firms, presumably because Dr. Lynde could not unpack 
rates from its licenses. However, whether a firm is similarly situated to TCL is a separate question from whether the firm's 
effective rate can be calculated, and what that rate means for non-discrimination under the FRAND commitment. "
1916,31," The Court is skeptical that Ericsson actually averages different levels of patent protection to create a global blended rate for 
global firms. First, there is no evidence that Ericsson actually does this in its business cases. Second, Ericsson's preferred 
metric for determining its portfolio strength is contribution counting. Contribution counts, discussed more below, are a single 
number independent of geography or intellectual property rights, and thus cannot be used to reflect or average geographic 
distinctions in patent portfolios."
1916,32," It is clear that at least some of TCL's devices would have pass-through rights to Ericsson's 3G SEPs because of a separate 
license agreement between Qualcomm and Ericsson, but the parties do not address the details of these devices or how that 
may affect the overall license."
1916,33," While PDX 237 is not in evidence, the Court found it to be an accurate summary of IDC data. (Ex. 1273.) The Court cites to 
this and other PDXs as accurate summaries of the evidence. "
1918,34," Until late 2011 Ericsson through its joint venture with Sony produced cell phones and thus required a cross-license for those 
handsets. (Brismark Decl. ¶ 11.) After Ericsson divested its mobile phone business in February 2012, it now requires a cross-
license only for its infrastructure equipment. (Kennedy Decl. ¶ 117.) With the exception of Samsung and ZTE, all of the other 
comparable licensees only required a license for Ericsson's handset SEPs."
1918,35," For example, with the Samsung license, keeping all of the inputs exactly the same and changing only the discount rates and 
3G/4G apportionment factor to those used by the experts in other unpackings, Samsung's one-way effective 4G rate can range 
from [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] "
1919,36," Ericsson's license with ZTE in 2011 for 2G/3G actually did state different percentage running royalty rates for released and 
prospective sales. (Ex. 1197 at 8.) However, this license was superseded by an amended license in 2015 and was not unpacked 
by either expert. (Ex. 1200.) "
1920,37," The Court has previously ruled that implementation patents will not be covered by this FRAND adjudication because they are 
not SEPs. (Docket No. 1055 at 7.) TCL also did not show that Ericsson's cross-licenses to implementation patents had any net 
value that would require adjusting the licensees' net balancing payments in either direction. However, licenses to Ericsson's SEPs for external modems and personal computers certainly do have value, and are a material 
term of this FRAND dispute. Ericsson's licenses with HTC and Samsung cover the licensees' sale of personal computers with 
cellular connectivity. (Ex. 1275 at 6 (HTC); Ex. 1276 at 4 (Samsung).) Ericsson's licenses with Apple and LG cover both personal 
computers and external modems with cellular connectivity. (Ex. 5331 at 2 (Apple); Ex. 199 at 2, 4 (LG).) Because both experts 
applied the entire balancing payment to handsets, the unpackings treated the licensees as paying 0% for external modems and 
personal computers in exchange for a higher royalty rate on handsets. The Court will treat TCL the same way."
1920,38," This is also true because Kennedy never calculated a 2G PSR. Both experts cited to each other when they justifed why they 
used a 3G PSR to unpack a combined 2G/3G rate. (Lynde Decl. ¶ 93 n.3; Kennedy Decl. ¶ 131.) However, Dr. Lynde at least 
explained that it is because 2G patents are less important and more likely to have expired, and he created a blended 2G/3G rate 
and does not try to unpack each 2G standard. (Lynde Decl. ¶ 93 n.3.) Kennedy explained that the method he used to determine 
PSRs (contribution counting, discussed below in the PSR section) does not exists for 2G. Thus, rather than introduce 
inconsistencies from using a new metric, he just used the same 3G PSR. (Kennedy Decl. ¶ 131.) A 3G PSR cannot be used to 
calculate rates for 2G GSM/GPRS or 2G EDGE. The only comparable licensee that sells 2G products whose 2G net balancing 
payments could be determined is Samsung, so in unpacking the Samsung license the Court chose to apportion out the 2G net 
balancing payment and calculate just 3G and 4G rates. "
1921,39," It appears that the parties have unpacked all payments to the beginning of each license. If the Court declared the final rate as 
a running dollar-per-unit royalty, it would then have to go an additional step and determine how to implement that over the five-
year license by either having the nominal rate increased to keep Ericsson's return constant in present dollars, or keeping the 
nominal rate the same and having TCL pay a higher effective rate in the first half the license to balance out the second half. "
1922,," Because the Court states its ultimate rates as a running percentage royalty, it need not worry about how the time value of money 
will affect these rates."
1922,40," It is unclear whether the revenue projections in Ericsson's business cases for Apple, Samsung, HTC and LG are based on the 
licensee's wholesale or retail sales. These were all lump sum deals, so Ericsson would not necessarily have had a business 
reason to prefer one over the other. Brismark stated only that its business cases ""endeavor to use the most reliable sales data 
available at the time, either from market analysts or from the licensee."" (Brismark Decl. ¶ 61.) To the extent that the business 
case data is wholesale data, it would tend to produce higher rates than IDC data. The Court keeps this problem in mind in 
ultimately setting a FRAND rate, and uses business case projections as the lower limit of the licensee's revenue, and IDC data 
as the upper limit. "
1923,41," This is so because licensee revenue is in the denominator of the unpacking equation; thus lower licensee revenue means a 
higher effective royalty rate. "
1924,42," This is a different concept than TCL's importance and contribution analysis discussed in the Top Down section. (See p.40, 
supra.) "
1931,43, This last amendment was retroactive and not actually signed until October 2016. 
1938,44," Stacking in this sense is Ericsson's proposed approach of literally stacking the full price of each standard for backwards-
compatible devices for devices that have 3G pass-through rights."
1938,45," The Court granted summary judgment for Ericsson that the Pass-Through Rates term for the prospective license did not 
violate FRAND. (Docket No. 1055 at 8.) "
1939,46," Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 44.1 provides that once a party gives notice of its intent to raise an issue of foreign law, it 
becomes the district court's responsibility to determine the relevant foreign law and apply it to the issue at hand. Fed. R. Civ. P. 
44.1; Republic of the Philippines v. Marcos, 862 F.2d 1355, 1361 (9th Cir. 1988) (en banc). In making this determination, courts 
may consider ""any relevant material or source, including testimony, whether or not submitted by a party or admissible under the 
Federal Rules of Evidence."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 44.1. Here the Court had the benefit of well-qualified legal experts on both sides. 
(Fauvarque-Cosson Decl.; Stoffel-Munck Decl.) "
1940,47," Elsewhere Ericsson has argued ""[t]he fact that many companies have entered into WCDMA licenses with Qualcomm since 
1999 does not establish that the royalties or other terms included in those licenses are fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory."" 
(Ex. 77 at 6.) "
1946,1," This case also involves a separate plaintiff class of direct purchasers. The approval of the proposed settlement of the claims of 
that class awaits a final fairness hearing. D. 461. "
1963,2," Because the named plaintiffs have standing to assert a claim based on the allegedly anticompetitive conduct of the 
Defendants, they also have standing to represent a putative class of similarly injured parties. The issue of which specific state 
laws govern the dispute at issue is a choice of law question, not a standing question. See In re Buspirone Litig., 185 F. Supp. 2d 
363, 377. The parties appear to be in agreement that the dispute will be governed by the laws of the state in which the qualifying 
purchase was made. "
1964,3," The Court is mindful of the disagreement between courts about this issue where named plaintiffs, like the named plaintiffs here, 
assert the same injury-in-fact but under the laws of some state laws in which they have not made a qualifying purchase. 
Compare Blessing v. Sirius XM Radio, Inc., 756 F. Supp. 2d 445, 452 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) with In re Propranolol Antitrust Litig., 249 
F. Supp. 3d 712, 727 (S.D.N.Y. 2017). But, even considering this disagreement, the Court concludes that Article III standing is 
satisfied here based upon the analysis above. "

9684; 16 C 8874; 16 C 9912; 16 C 9900. "
1990,2," The motions were supported by a number of briefs, some filed by Defendants jointly, others individually. Plaintiffs opposed the 
motions with two briefs: one filed by the ""Direct Plaintiffs,"" and the other filed by the ""Indirect Plaintiffs."" "
1992,3," A ""pullet"" is ""a young hen; specifically . . . a chicken less than a year old."" See Merriam-Webster Dictionary, www.merriam-
webster.com (last visited Nov. 20, 2017)."
1992,4," The Court assumes the term ""tray pack"" refers to the common method of packaging chicken meat for retail sale on a form tray 
covered in plastic wrap. See ""Tyson Foods to invest $110 million in Georgia plant,"" Food Business News, Jan. 27, 2015 
(http://www.foodbusinessnews.net/articles/news_home/Business_News/20

(""The . . . plant . . . will convert to supply fresh tray-pack chicken to meet the needs of regional retail customers.""). "
1993,5, The Court has preliminarily approved a settlement between Fieldale Farms and the Direct Plaintiffs. R. 462.
1993,6," The term ""egg sets"" means the ""number of eggs placed in incubators."" R. 212 ¶ 140B. "
2004,7," This was a summary judgment decision, so the Court considers the percentages at issue in that case merely as an example."
2004,8," Defendants' additional argument that ""the complaint also concedes many defendants acted contrary to the alleged conspiracy"" 
is based on material that is outside the complaint, or arguments that test the truth of Plaintiffs' allegations. See R. 280 at 19-20. 
These are arguments for summary judgment. "
2008,9," Defendants implicitly argue that Twombly imports a probability requirement into the plausibility standard in applying the 
standard to alternative explanations to conspiracy claims, when the Supreme Court suggested that ""parallel conduct allegations 
that would state a § 1 claim,"" include ""'parallel behavior that would probably not result from chance.'"" 550 U.S. at 557 n.4 
(quoting 6 Areeda & Hovenkam ¶ 1425, at 167-68) (emphasis added). But noting that conduct that ""would probably not result 
from change"" is an example of a plausible conspiracy allegation does not mean that all plausible claims must meet a standard of 
probability. Furthermore, this quote from Twombly is in turn a quote from the Areed & Hovenkamp treatise, which was published 
prior to Twombly instituting its fine distinction between the terms ""probable"" and ""plausible."" Considering the Court's clear 
insistence that it has not ""impos[ed] a probability requirement at the pleading stage,"" 550 U.S. at 556, this Court disagrees with 
the weight Defendants give to Twombly's quote of the word ""probable."" "
2009,10," The defendants who make this argument are the following: Mountaire, R. 275; Sanderson, R. 277; Wayne Farms, R. 283; 
George's, R. 285; Perdue, R. 288; Foster Farms, R. 289; Koch, R. 291; and Peco, R. 297. "
2016,11," HN17[
] Damages for conspiracies in violation of the Sherman Act § 1 are available through the Clayton Act § 4, which provides: ""any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may 
sue therefor in any district court of the United States in the district in which the defendant resides or is found or have an agent, 
without respect to the amount in controversy, and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained."" 15 U.S.C. § 15(a). "
2018,12," As an initial matter, Defendants do not argue that Plaintiffs have failed to sufficiently allege an antitrust injury. "
2019,13," Int'l Bhd. of Teamsters, Local 734 Health & Welfare Tr. Fund v. Philip Morris Inc., 196 F.3d 818, 828 (7th Cir. 1999)."
2019,14," The Supreme Court has acknowledged this borrowing. See AGC, 459 U.S. at 545 (""The [Illinois Brick] concerns should guide 
us in determining [who] is a proper plaintiff."")."
2019,15," Additionally, although the California Supreme Court has not expressly addressed AGC, it has held that California's antitrust 
statute is ""broader in range and deeper in reach that then Sherman Act,"" In re Cipro Cases I & II, 61 Cal. 4th 116, 187 Cal. Rptr. 
3d 632, 348 P.3d 845, 872 (Cal. 2015), and that ""[i]nterpreations of federal antitrust law are at most instructive, not conclusive, 
when construing [California's antitrust statute]."" Aryeh v. Canon Bus. Sols., Inc., 55 Cal. 4th 1185, 151 Cal. Rptr. 3d 827, 292 
P.3d 871, 877 (Cal. 2013). On the basis of this authority, the Court will not impose AGC's requirements on California antitrust 
law. "
2020,16," The Seventh Circuit, of course, did not have an Illinois Brick repealer to contend with when it applied federal law in Loeb and 
stated that ""apportion[ing] damages along a chain of distribution [is] forbidden by AGC."" 306 F.3d at 494."
2020,17," This reasoning also suffices to reject Defendants' argument that ""harmonization"" statutes passed by some states are a basis 
to apply the AGC factors to those states' antitrust laws. ""Harmonization"" statutes are laws that require a state's courts to interpret 
the state's antitrust statutes in harmony with federal law. But Iowa, Nebraska, New Mexico, and New York applied AGC in 
accord with their states' harmonization statutes. This did not prevent the courts in those states from recognizing that Illinois Brick 
repealers work to save the claims of true indirect purchasers, like the Indirect Plaintiffs in this case. "
2024,18," Defendants cite no authority that Rule 9(b) applies to Missouri's consumer protection statute, so the Court will not address 
Defendants' broad-brush claim that all consumer protection statutes must comply with Rule 9(b) as it applies to Missouri."
2024,19," Defendants cite no authority that Rule 9(b) applies to South Carolina's consumer protection statute, so the Court will not 
address Defendants' broad-brush claim that all consumer protection statutes must comply with Rule 9(b) as it applies to South 
Carolina. "
