23,1, Neither party contends that the legal standard varies for the state law claim. 
31,1," For convenience, this opinion refers to ""the Zarembas"" collectively. That moniker refers to all three of the defendant-
appellees/cross-appellants: Zaremba Family Farms, the Zaremba Group, and Walter Zaremba. "
32,2," Not to be confused with the poison pill of Delaware lore. See, e.g., Unitrin, Inc. v. Am. Gen. Corp., 651 A.2d 1361 (Del. 1995). "
33,3," The Zarembas argue that a juror could draw an adverse inference from the fact that, when asked about the call under oath, the 
executives involved invoked their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. But the Encana executive involved in the call 
later revoked his Fifth Amendment invocation and testified that the executives did not speak about the Zarembas and that they 
did not reach a deal with Chesapeake on that call. "
36,4," The Zarembas take a curious position in interpreting § 566.1. At one point, they rely on § 566.1 to argue that consideration is 
never required for a waiver. But this argument is contrary to the provision's plain text, which indicates that an agreement 
discharging an obligation is not invalid absent consideration if there is a signed writing. Elsewhere, the Zarembas reverse 
course, suggesting that § 566.1 does not apply to waivers at all. We will assume to the Zarembas' benefit, however, that § 566.1 
does apply and that absent consideration, the Zarembas could enforce Encana's waiver by pointing to a signed writing."
36,5," Given that Encana was entitled to judgment as a matter of law at the close of proofs, we need not reach its claim that the 
district court improperly instructed the jury on the Zarembas' waiver defense."
36,6," Before the case was submitted to the jury, Walter Zaremba and the Zaremba Group voluntarily dismissed their counterclaims in 
recognition of the fact that damages accruing from those claims accrued to Zaremba Family Farms. For continuity, this section 
will continue to refer to ""the Zarembas."" "
40,1," Cisco previously filed an action against Arista, alleging that Arista infringes Cisco's patents and copyrights in its command line 
interface (""CLI""). Cisco Systems, Inc. v. Arista Networks, Inc., Case No. 14-cv-05344-BLF (the ""CLI case""). A jury found that "
41,," Arista infringed Cisco's copyright but that the infringement was excused by the scènes à faire affirmative defense. The jury did 
not find patent infringement. Id. at Dkt. 749. "
45,2," The Court does not mean to suggest that Kodak bans all policy shifts, but rather that Dr. Carlton's opinions are impermissibly 
overbroad by suggesting that there are absolutely no limits."
45,3," The Court also does not find that paragraphs 77 and 83 are necessarily inconsistent with Kodak. The Court need not discuss 
those paragraphs in detail because those portions are already excluded as discussed in the previous subsection. "
48,4," Dr. Scott Morton treats the period from the first quarter in 2015 to the last quarter in 2016 as the ""conduct period"" when Cisco 
was actively litigating the CLI case. Scott Morton Report ¶ 208. Cisco filed the CLI case on December 5, 2014 and the jury 
reached a jury verdict on December 14, 2016."
48,5," Cisco also contends that Dr. Scott Morton fails to consider the increased market share of Huawei. Scott Morton Mot. 8. 
However, Huawei does not have a significant presence in the U.S. (see Fig. 4 of Scott Morton Report) and Huawei's increase in 
worldwide market share is largely irrelevant because Dr. Scott Morton estimates only loss of revenues in the U.S. as a 
conservative measure. Id. ¶ 212 (explaining that the damages calculation exclusively considers only Arista's U.S. revenues as a 
conservative estimate). "
49,6," Cisco also contends that Arista failed to take discovery of its customers on whether Arista's lost sales were due to the CLI 
litigation or the ITC actions. See Hearing Tr. 41:2-8. Arista responds that it cannot survey unidentified customers and that it is 
not required to survey all customers in the industry. Id. at 55:15-21. The Court finds that Arista's lack of discovery of its 
customers does not affect the reliability and admissibility of Dr. Scott Morton's opinions although conducting such discovery may 
have bolstered her analysis. "
52,1," Because the Court has issued many opinions already in this case, and because of the exigencies of trial, this memorandum 
necessarily does not set out all of the background facts of this litigation. The parties know them well. Generally, however, the 
Court makes reference to the Court's September 2016 opinion on a different question on the Capper-Volstead Act, as well as 
the Court's summary judgment ruling. See In re Processed Egg Prods. Antitrust Litig., 206 F. Supp. 3d 1033 (E.D. Pa. 2016). "
53,2," Thus, for example, if a USEM member owned 10% of the total hen-laying eggs in USEM, that producer would be required to 
supply 10% of the eggs for the proposed export. "
54,3," The operative definition in Black's Law Dictionary notes that value means the ""monetary worth or price of something; the 
amount of goods, services, or money that something commands in an exchange."" Black's Law Dictionary, Value."
54,4," If the Court uses market price as the correct way to determine the price a good commands, it necessarily follows that volume is 
an adequate proxy. This is because volume multiplied by price equals value, and the market price becomes a constant. 
Therefore, volume would be directly proportional to value. "
61,*," This summary constitutes no part of the opinion of the court. It has been prepared by court staff for the convenience of the 
reader. "
62,1," The Supply Chains Act, Cal. Civ. Code § 1714.43, was enacted in 2010. The California Attorney General later described the 
requirements of the Act: This Act requires large retailers and manufacturers doing business in California [**6]  to disclose on their websites their 
""efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from [their] direct supply chain for tangible goods offered for sale."" . . . "
63,," Companies subject to the Act must post disclosures on their Internet websites related to five specific areas: verification, 
audits, certification, internal accountability, and training. KAMALA D. HARRIS, CAL. DEP'T OF JUSTICE, THE CALIFORNIA TRANSPARENCY IN SUPPLY CHAINS ACT: A RESOURCE GUIDE, i (2015). "
64,2," The court also determined that plaintiffs' complaint alleged that eMachines actively concealed the defect. Collins, 134 Cal. Rptr. 
3d at 594. "
65,3," Plaintiff also cites Rubenstein v. Gap, Inc., 14 Cal. App. 5th 870, 222 Cal. Rptr. 3d 397 (Ct. App. 2017). The plaintiffs in 
Rubenstein alleged that Gap violated the consumer protection laws ""based on Gap's alleged misrepresentation in using the Gap 
and Banana Republic brand names for [factory store] items that had never been sold in traditional Gap and Banana Republic 
stores and/or were of lesser quality, and also on Gap's failure to disclose these facts to consumers. Id. at 401. The court rejected 
the plaintiffs' claims, reasoning that the plaintiffs did not ""allege facts showing that the sales history of factory store items is 
material to reasonable consumers."" It further held that ""any quality issues with factory store merchandise were not in Gap's 
exclusive knowledge."" Id. at 405. Additionally, after oral argument in this case, the California Court of Appeal, Fifth District, decided Gutierrez v. CarMax Auto 
Superstores Cal., 19 Cal. App. 5th 1234, 228 Cal. Rptr. 3d 699 (Ct. App. 2018). In Gutierrez, the defendant car dealer did not 
disclose that the car that the plaintiff purchased was subject to a safety recall relating to the car's braking and lighting systems. 
The court held that the omitted information was material because it related to safety concerns—which would be important to the 
reasonable consumer. Id. at 705. Further, the court concluded that the car dealer had a duty to disclose the recall because 
""CarMax made partial representations about the vehicle's braking and lighting systems and those representations were likely to 
mislead for want of communication of the facts about the recall."" Id. at 722-23. As Gutierrez is a partial misrepresentation case, it 
does not affect the outcome of this purely omissions-based case."
65,4," Neither Rubenstein nor Gutierrez mentions the ""central functionality"" test, but their facts are consistent with requiring that the 
alleged defect be physical and important to the product's function. In Gutierrez, the alleged omission related to a physical defect 
that created a safety hazard. 228 Cal. Rptr. 3d at 723. In Rubenstein, the court concluded that there were no ""facts showing that 
the sales history of factory store items is material to reasonable consumers."" 222 Cal. Rptr. 3d at 405."
65,5," The parties also dispute whether Plaintiff sufficiently pleaded that Mars had knowledge that Plaintiff did not about the existence 
of child or slave labor in the supply chain. Plaintiff argues that Mars need only have ""superior"" knowledge over the consumer to 
satisfy the LiMandri prong, whereas Mars contends that the test is ""exclusive"" knowledge. While we need not reach the issue 
here, Mars appears to have the better reading of California law. "
66,6," For example, even though we offer no binding opinion on the issue, Wilson may still apply where the defect in question does 
not go to the central functionality of the product but still creates a safety hazard."
66,7," Plaintiff has an outstanding motion to certify the following question to the California Supreme Court: ""Must a pure omission-
based consumer deception claim under the UCL, FAL, and CLRA involve a safety concern to be actionable?"" Because Plaintiff 
cannot establish that Mars had a duty to disclose, even if he is not required to plead a safety hazard, the answer to Plaintiff's 
question is not outcome-determinative. See Cal. R. of Court 8.548(a)(1) (""The [California] Supreme Court may decide a question 
of California law if . . . [t]he decision could determine the outcome of a matter pending in the requesting court.""). We therefore 
deny the motion to certify the question. "
68,8," Gregory also rejected plaintiffs' tethering claim because ""it would impinge on a separate state policy favoring freedom of 
contract by the parties to commercial real property leases."" 128 Cal. Rptr. 2d at 395 (quotation marks omitted)."
68,9," Because we hold that Plaintiff has not pleaded a claim under the CLRA, UCL, or FAL, we need not, and do not, reach any of 
Mars' other arguments in support of affirmance. "
71,1," Plaintiff filed a complaint against New York Coalition Against Hunger, Christopher G. Karagheuoff, and Joel Berg. Hunger Free 
America, Inc., was erroneously sued as ""New York Coalition Against Hunger,"" and Christopher Karagheuoff, and Joel Berg were 
never served. Hunger Free America, Inc., removed the case to this court where it proceeds as the only defendant served."
71,2," Plaintiff asserts the corporation was ""federally"" incorporated in February 2010. A California Secretary of State record shows 
Plaintiff's original entity, Hour of Truth Ministry, Inc., amended its corporate name to ""Hunger Free America, Inc."" in 2016. (See 
Doc. 19-2.) This document was attached to Plaintiff's original complaint. (Doc. 1, p. 55.)"
71,3," Defendant is a non-profit corporation, originally founded as New York City Coalition Against Hunger. It adopted its name, 
Hunger Free America, Inc. in early 2016. "
73,4," Plaintiff submitted an untimely opposition brief, which is unsigned."
73,5," As discussed in the Court's last order, the '297 Registration mark covers a specific design consisting of the words ""Huger Free 
America"" in green lettering with black and white outlining, below a background of farm rows and vegetables. The graphic mark is 
limited to t-shirts. See United States Patent and Trademark Office, Trademark Electronic Search System (""TESS""); 
http://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&state=4808:4wwulv.2.3 "
75,6," In 1995, Congress amended Section 43 of the Trademark Act of 1946, 15 U.S.C.§1125, to provide a remedy for the ""dilution of 
famous marks."" The FAC does not allege a viable dilution claim, which is predicated on the lessening of the capacity of a famous 
mark to identify and distinguish goods and services, regardless of the likelihood of confusion. A party alleging dilution is required 
to show, among other things, that the mark is famous — i.e., so prominent and renowned as to be a household name. See Jada 
Toys, Inc. v. Mattel, Inc., 518 F.3d 628, 635 (9th Cir. 2008). There are no facts showing that any mark or standard character at 
issue in the FAC is famous. "

79,3," LabMD is no longer in operation but still exists as a company and continues to secure its computers and the patient data stored 
within them."
79,4," LabMD's program included ""a compliance program, training, firewalls, network monitoring, password controls, access controls, 
antivirus, and security-related inspections."""
79,5," The record is not clear on the point but we assume that the billing manager installed the peer-to-peer application on her 
workstation computer. "
80,6," As described by the ALJ who initially presided over this case, [Tiversa's] efforts included representing to LabMD that the 1718 File had been found on a peer-to-peer network and 
sending LabMD a Tiversa Incident Response Services Agreement describing Tiversa's proposed fee schedule, payment 
terms, and services that would be provided. These contacts continued from mid-May through mid-July 2008. In these 
communications, Tiversa represented that Tiversa had ""continued to see individuals [**5]  [on peer-to-peer networks] 
searching for and downloading copies"" of the 1718 File. . . . Tiversa's representations in its communications with LabMD that the 1718 File was being searched for on peer-to-peer 
networks, and that the 1718 File had spread across peer-to-peer networks, were not true. These assertions were the ""usual 
sales pitch"" to encourage the purchase of remediation services from Tiversa. . . . Tiversa did, however, share a copy of the 1718 File with a Dartmouth College professor, who in February 2009 published an 
article about data security in the healthcare industry. Tiversa was a ""research partner"" for the article, meaning it searched for 
and provided the professor with relevant files to analyze. The professor did not share the 1718 File or its contents with anyone."
80,7," Tiversa's CEO and the FTC offered testimony at a 2007 congressional hearing regarding peer-to-peer file-sharing technology. 
About two months after the hearing, the FTC and Tiversa began communicating. The FTC wanted Tiversa to provide it with 
information regarding companies' data-security practices. Tiversa, though, did not want a formal request for information—such 
as a Civil Investigative Demand (""CID"")—to be issued directly to it because it had been in talks about its possible acquisition by 
a third party. Tiversa thus created an entity called ""The Privacy Institute"" so that a CID could be issued without directly 
implicating Tiversa. The FTC issued a CID to The Privacy Institute in 2009 and The Privacy Institute provided the FTC with the 
1718 File."
80,8," The FTC's complaint alleged that LabMD (a) did not develop, implement, or maintain a comprehensive information security program to protect consumers' personal 
information. Thus, for example, employees were allowed to send emails with such information to their personal email 
accounts without using readily available measures to protect the information from unauthorized disclosure; (b) did not use readily available measures to identify commonly known or reasonably foreseeable security risks and 
vulnerabilities on its networks. By not using measures such as penetration tests, for example, respondent could not 
adequately assess the extent of the risks and vulnerabilities of its networks; (c) did not use adequate measures to prevent employees from accessing personal information not needed to perform their 
jobs; (d) did not adequately train employees to safeguard personal information; (e) did not require employees, or other users with remote access to the networks, to use common authentication-related 
security measures, such as periodically changing passwords, prohibiting the use of the same password across applications 
and programs, or using two-factor authentication; (f) did not [**7]  maintain and update operating systems of computers and other devices on its networks. For example, on 
some computers respondent used operating systems that were unsupported by the vendor, making it unlikely that the 
systems would be updated to address newly discovered vulnerabilities; and "
81,," (g) did not employ readily available measures to prevent or detect unauthorized access to personal information on its 
computer networks. For example, respondent did not use appropriate measures to prevent employees from installing on 
computers applications or materials that were not needed to perform their jobs or adequately maintain or review records of 
activity on its networks. As a result, respondent did not detect the installation or use of an unauthorized file sharing 
application on its networks."
81,9," Prior to the hearing, LabMD amended its answer and once again unsuccessfully moved to dismiss the FTC's complaint. 
Nothing in the answer or the motion is pertinent here."
81,10," HN2[
] Section 5(n) states, as a prerequisite for an act or practice to be unfair, ""[T]he act or practice [1] causes or is likely to cause substantial injury to consumers [2] which is not reasonably avoidable by consumers themselves and [3] not outweighed by 
countervailing benefits to consumers or to competition."""
81,11, See supra note 10.

policy-statement-unfairness."
83,24," Section 5(n) now states, with regard to public policy, ""In determining whether an act or practice is unfair, the Commission may 
consider established public policies as evidence to be considered with all other evidence. Such public policy considerations may 
not serve as a primary basis for such determination."" We do not take this ambiguous statement to mean that the Commission 
may bring suit purely on the basis of substantial consumer injury. The act or practice alleged to have caused the injury must still 
be unfair under a well-established legal standard, whether grounded in statute, the common law, or the Constitution. "
84,25," The FTC's complaint does not state that LimeWire was installed contrary to company policy. But the complaint implies as 
much in that it does not allege that LabMD's policy allowed the installation. Further, undisputed evidence in the record indicates 
that LimeWire was installed contrary to LabMD policy."
84,26, See supra note 8.
84,27," After outlining LabMD's shortcomings in data security, namely those items listed in note 8, supra, the FTC's complaint states in 
paragraph 22 that LabMD's failure to employ reasonable and appropriate measures to prevent [**17]  unauthorized access to personal information, 
including dates of birth, SSNs, medical test codes, and health information, caused, or is likely to cause, substantial injury to 
consumers that is not offset by countervailing benefits to consumers or competition and is not reasonably avoidable by 
consumers. This practice was, and is, an unfair act or practice. (Emphasis added). Oddly, paragraph 23 of the complaint states that the ""acts and practices of [LabMD] as alleged in this 
complaint constitute unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5(a)."" (Emphasis added). Thus, 
paragraph 22 seems to conceive of all of LabMD's data-security deficiencies as culminating in a single unfair act or practice, and 
paragraph 23, though unspecific and perhaps boilerplate, suggests that there were multiple unfair acts or practices. Paragraph 
22 better encapsulates the FTC's theory, as the complaint in preceding paragraphs lays out a number of deficiencies that, ""taken 
together,"" constitute unreasonable data security. Further, the Commission's cease and desist order states, ""[T]he Commission 
has concluded that LabMD's data security practices were unreasonable and constitute an unfair act or practice that violates 
Section 5."" (Emphasis added). See Appendix at 1. "
85,28," FTC Policy Statement on Unfairness, supra note 23."
85,29," This provision states, "
86,," The Commission may commence a civil action to recover a civil penalty in a district court of the United States against any 
person, partnership, or corporation which violates any rule under this subchapter respecting unfair or deceptive acts or 
practices . . . with actual knowledge or knowledge fairly [**21]  implied on the basis of objective circumstances that such act 
is unfair or deceptive and is prohibited by such rule. In such action, such person, partnership, or corporation shall be liable 
for a civil penalty of not more than $10,000 for each violation."
86,15," U.S.C. § 45(m)(1)(A). As explained in note 39, infra, the Commission has increased the penalty amount to $41,484 per 
violation."
86,30," The Commission may also bring a suit in federal district court or a state court of competent jurisdiction to obtain relief in the 
form of consumer redress. 15 U.S.C. § 57b."
86,31," See FTC, Operating Manual Chapter 10.7, available at https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/attachments/ftc-administrative-
staff-manuals/ch10administrativelitigation.pdf (stating that ""many [of the Commission's] adjudicative rules are derived from the 
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure""); see also Stephanie W. Kanwit, Federal Trade Commission § 8:1 (2017) (noting that the 
Commission ""has held over the years that the [Federal Rules of Civil Procedure] can provide an analytical framework for the 
disposition of related issues"" (quotations omitted))."
86,32," The Commission may, in its discretion, refer the motion back to the ALJ for a ruling. 16 C.F.R. § 3.22. "
87,33," The ALJ's decision must set out findings of fact and conclusions of law, 16 C.F.R. § 3.51(c), just like a district judge must do 
pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a) following a bench trial."
87,34," As a whole, this administrative procedure, set out in the FTC's Rules of Practice, effectively supersedes 15 U.S.C. § 45(b), the 
FTC Act provision governing Commission proceedings."
87,35," There are a couple of subtle differences in how cease and desist orders and injunctions are reviewed. First, an appellate court 
reviews a district court's findings of fact for clear error and those of the FTC under the ""substantial evidence"" standard. McWane, 
Inc., 783 F.3d at 824; Dyer, 395 F.3d at 1210. In practice, however, these two standards make little or no difference in terms of 
outcome. See Dickinson v. Zurko, 527 U.S. 150, 162-63, 119 S. Ct. 1816, 1823, 144 L. Ed. 2d 143 (1999) (""The court/agency 
[substantial-evidence] standard, as we have said, is somewhat less strict than the court/court [clearly erroneous] standard. But 
the difference is a subtle one—so fine that (apart from the present case) we have failed to uncover a single instance in which a 
reviewing court conceded that use of one standard rather than the other would in fact have produced a different outcome.""). 
Further, although both the FTC's and a district court's conclusions of law are reviewed de novo, appellate courts give ""some 
deference to the Commission's informed judgment that a particular commercial practice is to be condemned as 'unfair.'"" Ind. 
Fed'n of Dentists, 476 U.S. at 454, 106 S. Ct. at 2016."
87,36," We note that with respect to violations of final cease and desist orders, the Commission may also bring a 15 U.S.C. § 57b 
action as described in note 30, supra."
87,37," The two remedies are similar in nature. Indeed, not long after Section 5's civil-penalty scheme was implemented, the 
Commissioner of the FTC described civil penalties as ""an additional remedy to that formerly employed of invoking the inherent 
power of the courts to punish for contempt anyone who violated a court order directing compliance with an order of the 
Commission."" See Hon. R. E. Freer, Commissioner, Federal Trade Commission, Address before the Annual Convention of the 
Proprietary Association (May 17, 1938). "
88,38," A cease and desist order is made final pursuant to the conditions set forth in 15 U.S.C. § 45(g). Section 5(l) directs the 
Commission to call upon the United States Attorney General to commence a civil-penalty action against the respondent. The 
Commission can bring the action itself, however, in accordance with the criteria in 15 U.S.C. § 56(a). Section 5(m)(1)(B) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. § 45(m)(1)(B), authorizes the Commission to file suit against a nonrespondent who ""with 
actual knowledge"" engages in the ""act or practice"" declared a violation of Section 5(a) and enjoined via a cease and desist order 
entered in a previous administrative adjudication. The previous adjudication, however, is afforded no collateral estoppel effect 
against the defendant. That is, the defendant can challenge the factual predicate for the cease and desist order and the ultimate 
determination that the facts found in the previous adjudication constituted an unfair act or practice. See id. § 45(m)(2)."
88,39," Sections 5(l) and 5(m)(1)(B) set the maximum penalty at $10,000, but the Commission may adjust this figure for inflation under 
16 C.F.R. § 1.98. Hence the current $41,484 figure, which ""appl[ies] only to penalties assessed after January 22, 2018"" but 
""includ[es] those penalties whose associated violation predated January 22, 2018."" Id. "
89,40," See BMW of N. Am., Inc. v. Gore, 517 U.S. 559, 574, & n.22, 116 S. Ct. 1589, 1598, & n.22, 134 L. Ed. 2d 809 (1996) 
(""Elementary notions of fairness enshrined in our constitutional jurisprudence dictate that a person receive fair notice . . . of the 
conduct that will subject him to punishment . . . . [T]he basic protection against judgments without notice afforded by the Due 
Process Clause is implicated by civil penalties."" (citation, quotations, and emphasis omitted)); see also Sessions v. Dimaya, 584 
U.S.    , 138 S. Ct. 1204, 1228-29, 200 L. Ed. 2d 549 (2018) (Gorsuch, J., concurring) (suggesting that the severity of a civil 
penalty corresponds with the degree of fair notice of unlawful conduct that must be accorded to the defendant)."
89,41," Following this provision in the Commission's cease and desist order are five equally vague items which must be included in 
LabMD's data-security program. See Appendix at 2-3. These items suffer the same enforceability problems discussed below. "
90,42," Further, the order's other provisions, mentioned in note 41, supra, also fail to state with specificity the actions LabMD must 
take to bring its program into compliance with the order."
90,43," See also FTC v. Trudeau, 579 F.3d 754, 763 (7th Cir. 2009) (""To succeed on a contempt petition, the FTC must demonstrate 
by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent has violated the express and unequivocal command of a court order."" 
(quotations omitted))."
90,44," The purpose of a show cause hearing is to determine whether the alleged contemner has violated the injunctive provision as it 
stands. If the party holding the injunction wishes to modify the provision, the party must move the district court to effect the 
modification. Implicit in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65 is the notion that before the modification can be made, the adverse 
party must be provided notice of the proposed modification and an opportunity to be heard. "
101,1," For consistency throughout this Opinion, I will use the phrase ""video programming and distribution industry"" to include creation, 
packaging, and distribution of professionally produced video content. Of particular relevance here, the Court's definition of ""video 
programming and distribution industry"" encompasses programmers such as Turner; traditional multichannel video programming 
distributors (""MVPDs"") such as cable and satellite companies; virtual multichannel video programming distributors (""virtual 
MVPDs"" or ""vMVPDs"") such as DirecTV Now and DISH's Sling; and subscription video on demand services (""SVODs"") such as 
Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime. By contrast, I use the phrase ""pay-TV"" to refer only to the packaging and delivery of linear — 
or ""live"" — television content. That phrase encompasses only MVPDs and virtual MVPDs. "
102,2," Many materials before the Court contain confidential business information or other proprietary data; such submissions were 
typically filed under seal with an accompanying redacted version accessible to the public. The Court has made great effort to 
refrain from quoting or otherwise including confidential business information in this Opinion, opting instead to refer generally to 
the exhibits or information filed under seal. "
103,3," In 2009, Comcast announced its intent to acquire ownership of NBCUniversal (""NBCU""), a media and entertainment company 
that owns the NBC and Telemundo networks as well as Universal Pictures and Universal Studios. See Compl. ¶¶ 16-17, United 
States v. Comcast Corp., 808 F. Supp. 2d 145 (D.D.C. 2011) (No. 11-cv-106) [Dkt. # 1]. Although the Government, through the 
Antitrust Division, filed an action claiming that the transaction would violate Section 7 of the Clayton Act — an action, as fortune 
would have it, also assigned to this Court — the Government also urged me to approve the transaction pursuant to a final 
judgment containing various ""remedies"" that it represented would ""diminish[] Comcast's ability to use [NBCU's] programming to 
harm competition."" Competitive Impact Statement 3, 7, Comcast Corp., 808 F. Supp. 2d 145 [Dkt. # 4]. Those remedies related 
to procedures set forth in a related FCC order governing the transaction, including, as especially relevant here, requirements 
that Comcast-NBCU: 1) submit to ""baseball style arbitration,"" at the distributor's option, in the event the parties were unable to 
reach a carriage agreement, 7/27/11 Hr'g Tr. 7:4-7 [Dkt. # 38], and 2) ""continue to provide"" video programming to the distributor 
""pursuant to the terms of any existing agreement until the arbitration is completed,"" Competitive Impact Statement Ex. A, at 24, 
Comcast Corp., 808 F. Supp. 2d 145 [Dkt. # 4-1]. At a hearing to discuss the proposed final judgment, counsel for the 
Government asserted that, ""especially in cases of vertical mergers, conduct remedies"" such as the ones proposed ""can be a 
very useful tool to address the competitive problems while preserving competition and allowing efficiencies"" that ""may result from 
the transaction."" 7/27/11 Hr'g Tr. 15:16-21. Ultimately, I approved the Government's proposed final judgment with a few 
modifications to allow me to better monitor the implementation of the remedies imposed as part of the judgment. See generally 
Comcast Corp., 808 F. Supp. 2d 145. The transaction proceeded and today Comcast-NBCU operates as a ""vertically integrated"" 
programmer and distributor. See Tr. 882:14-16 (Rigdon (Comcast)). "
105,4," That said, in the case of DISH's virtual MVPD, Sling, Turner did license only its ""core"" networks — CNN, TBS, TNT, and 
Cartoon Network. See Tr. 236:23-24 (Schlichting (DISH)). As Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes testified, because 85 to 90% of 
Turner's revenue comes from four networks, Turner is well situated to offer skinnier bundles. See id. at 3126:22-3127:3 (Bewkes 
(Time Warner)); see also id. at 584:18-24 (Martin (Turner)) (same). By contrast, NBCU's revenues are spread more evenly 
across its more than one-dozen networks. See id. at 3127:6 (Bewkes (Time Warner)). "
108,5," Although the Government asserts that ""consumers of Multichannel Video Distribution are largely insensitive to price changes"" 
as reflected by their continued payment of increased subscription costs, Gov't PFOF ¶ 35, at trial there was near-uniform 
testimony that ""consumers are up to here with subscription prices"" and that ""it's getting harder and harder"" for distributors to 
pass their increased costs along, Tr. 3089:6-11 (Bewkes (Time Warner)); id. at 3446:1-4 (Stephenson (AT&T)). That consumers 
are at a ""gag point"" when it comes to traditional MVPD subscription costs is further illustrated by the continued decline in 
subscriptions nationally. Id. at 140:13-15 (Fenwick (Cox)); id. at 3450:7-9 (Stephenson (AT&T))."
108,6," In the face of all that, the Government continues to insist that SVODs are merely ""complement[s]"" or ""adjunct[s]"" to traditional 
MVPDs, rather than competitors of traditional MVPDs; a few of the Government's third-party competitor witnesses testified to the 
same. Gov't PFOF ¶ 36. I agree with defendants that the Government's arguments (and the corresponding witness testimony) 
on that score defy reality, as demonstrated by the evidence adduced at trial. The evidence clearly showed that the leading 
SVODs — as vertically-integrated entities that produce and distribute their own award-winning content - fiercely compete both 
with programmers such as Turner and HBO and with traditional MVPDs and virtual MVPDs. Indeed, industry data reflects that 
large percentages of MVPD customers have chosen to ""cut the cord"" and receive content exclusively from SVODs. See supra 
pp. 22-24. To be sure, the Government contends that, notwithstanding the increasing prevalence of SVODs, ""[e]ven programmers believe 
MVPDs are likely to remain highly profitable in the future."" Gov't PFOF ¶ 13. That proposition rests on a document from May 
2016. Id. (citing PX78). As the Court learned at trial, however, the industry has undergone significant changes since mid-2016, 
diminishing the persuasiveness of that statement and others like it. To take just one example, video programming margins are 
declining, a fact that presents an obvious threat to future MVPD profitability. Tr. 3853:18-19 (Shapiro) (""I think it is not disputed 
that the video margins are going down.""). And while the Court accepts that traditional MVPDs continue to have a substantial 
subscriber base, and indeed may currently constitute a distinct submarket, see infra pp. 61-66, it is inescapable that SVODs 
have played a large role in causing the demand for and continued purchase of traditional MVPD subscriptions to ""declin[e] at a 
rapid pace."" Tr. 3450:7-3451:1 (Stephenson (AT&T)). To ignore those industry trends — trends that are transforming how 
consumers view video content and blurring the lines between programming, distribution, and web-based competitors - would be 
to ignore the Supreme Court's direction to examine this case with an eye toward the ""structure, history, and probable future"" of "
109,," this fast-changing industry. United States v. Gen. Dynamics Corp., 415 U.S. 486, 498, 94 S. Ct. 1186, 39 L. Ed. 2d 530 (1974) 
(internal quotation marks omitted). I, of course, cannot do that ! "
110,7," Those networks are TNT, TBS, CNN, CNN Español, CNN International, Cartoon Network/Adult Swim, TruTV, TCM, 
Boomerang, and HLN. See Defs.' PFOF ¶ 7. "
112,8," Turner has been able to negotiate for the rights to limited data from Hulu's and YouTube's virtual MVPDs. See Gov't PFOF ¶ 
336. As relevant here, however, that data relates only to the viewing patterns of those who view Time Warner content. That is a 
limited picture, as such data does not allow Turner to discern what its viewers are watching on competing channels, which could 
help develop a fuller picture of viewer preferences. Tr. 3101:13-22 (Bewkes (Time Warner))."
112,9," Turner's Lilliputian direct-to-consumer subscriber numbers, on their face, discredit the Government's assertion that ""Turner is 
also not the 'trapped wholesaler' it claims to be."" Gov't PFOF ¶ 30."
112,10," The Government states that ""pay-TV packages include linear TV programming, on-demand content, and typically premium 
channels like HBO."" Gov't PFOF ¶ 12 (emphasis added). However, no matter how many premium channels ""like HBO"" may be 
available on such packages, HBO itself has historically had only a 30% national penetration rate. See Tr. 1529:16-17 (Patel 
(AT&T)); id. at 3073:22-23 (Bewke s (Time Warner)). "
117,11," Nor did defendants broadly stipulate to the admission of the Government's proffered documentary evidence, as defendants 
seem to have done in recent antitrust cases in our Circuit. The parties also did not introduce their experts' reports into evidence; 
instead, they rested on the experts' trial testimony."
117,12," There was not a uniform rule mandating sponsorship of documents by witnesses. I took judicial notice, for example, of certain 
statements made by DirecTV and AT&T before the FCC without sponsoring witnesses. See Tr. 3966:5-3967:22. In the same 
way, I was mindful that some documents, such as a slide presentation known at trial as ""version 41,"" would not constitute 
hearsay, as they were introduced to establish the intent of the parties, rather than for the truth of the matter asserted."
117,13," Negotiations between the parties further winnowed the evidentiary disputes. See, e.g., 3/19/18 Hr'g Tr., PDF at p. 7 (morning 
session). The parties also heeded warnings from the Court during initial evidentiary hearings as to the likely inadmissibility of 
certain documents. For instance, after a warning as to the likely admissibility of newspaper clippings, defendants did not seek 
admission of those documents at trial. See 3/20/18 Hr'g Tr. 5:16-20 (afternoon session) (advising defendants that the Court 
""usually [does not] allow news articles [to be] introduced into evidence. I'll wait to see what you've got ... but I'm giving you fair 
notice here"")."
117,14," On March 9, 2018, the parties each filed a brief, laying out their theories of the case. [Dkt. ## 75, 76, 77]. On March 13, 2018, 
the parties filed a Statement of Evidentiary Objections under seal. [Dkt. # 86]. The same day, the parties filed a Joint Statement 
on the Burden of Proof at Trial, which set forth each side's views of the legal standards and burden of proof applicable to this 
case. [Dkt. # 87]. "
118,15," The Court explained to the parties that it appreciated both the public's interest in open judicial proceedings, and the 
importance to the Government's case of third-party testimony and the need to maintain confidentiality. Consistent with these 
competing interests, and applicable case law, the Court advised the parties that, when seeking to close the courtroom, they 
would first need to make a proffer explaining the necessity of doing so. Cf. 28 C.F.R. § 50.9 (2017) (reciting ""the vital public 
interest in open judicial proceedings"" and stating the policy that DOJ counsel ""shall not move for or consent to closure of a 
proceeding"" unless ""[n]o reasonable alternative exists for protecting the interests at stake"" and ""[f]ailure to close the proceedings 
will produce . . . [a] substantial likelihood of denial of the right . . . to a fair trial""). In order to accommodate those confidentiality interests, counsel agreed to craft their questions so as not to elicit sensitive 
business information. See Tr. 692:14-16 (""[G]overnment's counsel has got this choreographed approach here to get this 
information from you under oath without revealing it to the public.""); see also, e.g., id. at 99:12-14 (SEALED). Counsel routinely 
asked witnesses to point to or confirm for the Court the contents of documents under seal. See, e.g., id. at 119:1-21, 124:18-
125:13 (Fenwick (Cox)); 535:1 1-22, 662:7-20 (Martin (Turner)); id. at 1095:19-1096:7 (Breland (Turner)); id. at 3011:9-21 
(Christopher (AT&T)); id. at 3529:18-3530:10 (Quintero). Indeed, the Government succeeded in eliciting considerable testimony 
from a third-party witness — this time from AT&T's competitor, Cox - by way of a single exhibit. See, e.g., id. at 689:18-20 
(Hinson (Cox)) (""Your Honor, I'd like to mark Plaintiff's Exhibit, it's got some confidential information that Mr. Hinson can point 
to.""); see generally id. at 692:25-708:14; see also PX523. In those instances, the Court, but not the public, had access to the 
referenced documents. In the same way, counsel asked witnesses to describe the contents at an appropriate level of generality. 
See id. at 259:11-13 (Schlichting (DISH)); id. at 1278:13-1279:21 (Bewley (Altman Vilandrie)). Through skillful lines of inquiry and the use of exhibits and demonstratives, this approach resolved most confidentiality-based 
concerns. For several witnesses, the Government initially raised the possibility of going into closed session, before later 
declining to seek to do so. See, e.g., Tr. 439:14-16 (SEALED). Other times, the Government elected to establish the factual 
proffer necessary to close the courtroom. To take one example of the way in which — when it chose to do so — the Government 
developed the need for closing the courtroom, Government counsel confirmed with NBCU's Madison Bond in open court that he 
felt constrained by confidentiality obligations with respect to at least six different items. See, e.g., id. at 1992:2-1992:8; id. at 
1993:24-1994:6 (Bond (NBCU)). "
119,16," It is undisputed that the Government has the burden of proving a Section 7 violation. The Government's view on what measure 
of proof that burden requires, however, has been somewhat of a moving target. In some instances, the Government mirrors 
defendants' position that Section 7 requires a showing that the challenged transaction is ""likely"" to harm competition; in others, 
the Government states that it must show a ""reasonable probability"" or ""appreciable danger"" of harm to prevail. Compare Compl. 
¶ 44 (""The effect of the proposed merger would be likely to lessen competition substantially"" in the relevant markets.), and Gov't 
PFOF 20 (""The proposed merger would likely substantially lessen competition"" in the relevant markets.) (capitalization altered), 
with Gov't Post-Tr. Br. 13 (disputing that the ""United States must show that harm is 'likely'""), and Gov't PCOL ¶ 5 & n.1 (reciting a 
purportedly more lenient ""reasonable probability"" standard). In the final analysis, each alternative formulation appears aimed at 
clarifying the central point that Section 7 does not require ""certain"" harm, but instead permits courts to use predictive judgment to 
""arrest anticompetitive tendencies in their 'incipiency.'"" United States v. Penn-Olin Chem. Co., 378 U.S. 158, 171, 84 S. Ct. 
1710, 12 L. Ed. 2d 775 (1964) (quoting United States v. Philadelphia Nat'l Bank, 374 U.S. 321, 362, 83 S. Ct. 1715, 10 L. Ed. 2d 
915 (1963) (internal quotation marks omitted)). Thus, it is not surprising that courts have used these terms interchangeably. See, 
e.g., Hosp. Corp. of Am. v. FTC, 807 F.2d 1381, 1389 (7th Cir. 1986) (noting that Section 7 requires ""an appreciable danger"" of 
anticompetitive consequences and concluding in same paragraph that Commission had adequately demonstrated that the 
""challenged acquisitions are likely to foster collusive practices, harmful to consumers""); Anthem, 236 F. Supp. 3d at 215 (citing 
with approval other court's use of ""reasonably likely"" formulation, later concluding that ""[p]laintiffs have carried their burden to 
establish that the merger is likely to harm competition""). For present purposes, I need not further toil over discerning or articulating the daylight, if any, between ""appreciable danger,"" 
""probable,"" ""reasonably probable,"" and ""likely"" as used in the Section 7 context. That is because even assuming that the "
120,," ""reasonable probability"" or ""appreciable danger"" formulations govern here and require more than a ""mere possibility,"" but less 
than a ""more likely than not"" showing of harm, but see Baker Hughes, 908 F.2d at 991 (describing ""the ultimate issue"" in a 
Section 7 case as ""whether [the proposed] transaction is likely to lessen competition substantially"" (emphasis added)); Anthem, 
236 F. Supp. 3d at 215 (""merger is likely to harm competition""); United States v. Aetna, Inc., 240 F. Supp. 3d 1, 9 (D.D.C. 2017) 
(""the proposed merger is likely to substantially lessen competition""); FTC v. Staples, Inc., 190 F. Supp. 3d 100, 110 (D.D.C. 
2016) (""proposed merger is likely to reduce competition""), my conclusions regarding the Government's failure of proof would 
remain unchanged for all of the reasons discussed below."
120,17," Defendants assert that the burden-shifting framework is inapplicable to vertical merger cases, where no market-concentration-
based presumption of harm attaches. As such, defendants argue that the Government has the burden to account for all of 
defendants' proffered efficiencies as part of making its prima facie case. I am skeptical of this position, both as a matter of law 
and logic. Cf. Heinz, 246 F.3d at 720 (discussing ""efficiencies defense"" as a component of the defendants' case); 4A Areeda & 
Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law ¶ 970c. But given that the ""ultimate burden"" of proving a Section 7 violation rests with the plaintiff, H 
& R Block, Inc., 833 F. Supp. 2d at 49, any debate over burden shifting ""may be somewhat academic,"" as defense counsel 
conceded, 3/20/18 Hr'g Tr. 67:6-7 (morning session); cf. Baker Hughes, 908 F.2d at 991 (deeming ""the distinction between"" the 
""burden of production"" and ""the ultimate burden of persuasion"" as ""always an elusive distinction in practice""). That is especially 
so here, where, as will become evident, the Court's ruling does not turn on the efficiencies offered by defendants in their 
affirmative case, but rather on its conclusion that the Government's evidence, as ""undermined and ""discredit[ed]"" by defendants' "
121,," attacks, is insufficient to ""show[] a probability of substantially lessened competition,"" and thus that the Government has ""failed to 
carry its ultimate burden of persuasion."" Baker Hughes, 908 F.2d at 983, 990-91. I will nevertheless pause to mention briefly why I am confident that defendants will achieve considerable efficiencies beyond 
those conceded by the Government. At trial, defendants presented the Court with documentary and testimonial evidence 
concerning efficiencies likely to flow from the proposed merger. The efficiencies, defendants explain, come both on the ""cost"" 
side, and on the ""revenue"" side. By defendants' calculations, cost synergies will total $1.5 billion and revenue synergies $1 
billion on an annual basis. See Tr. 3234:17-3235:14 (Stankey (AT&T)). On the cost side, AT&T's John Stankey testified that the 
marriage of AT&T and Time Warner will lead to the elimination of redundant positions in each company, achievement of certain 
economies of scale, and insourcing of services that the acquired entity currently acquires from vendors. See id. at 3235:22-
3240:1. And on the revenue side, AT&T and Time Warner expect to see the gains in innovation — particularly by way of a new 
programmatic advertising platform — that motivated the merger in the first place. See id. at 3229:20-25, 3240:2-3246:9. Putting aside the revenue synergies, which, by their nature, are more uncertain, I have a high degree of confidence that 
defendants will generate most, if not all, of the predicted $1.5 billion in annual cost savings by 2021. See id. at 3234:13-20. 
AT&T derives its prediction through the same rigorous analytical process applied in each of its mergers. See id. at 3226:1-
3229:3; see also DX658. Most recently, in the acquisition of DirecTV, AT&T exceeded cost synergy predictions, which now total 
$2 billion annually. Tr. 3229:4-8, 3369:21-3370:4 (Stankey (AT&T)). Indeed, it is uncontested that AT&T has a strong record of 
meeting similar cost synergy estimates in past mergers. See id. at 3229:2-3, 3229:9; see also id. at 3226:3-5. That ""analogous 
past experience"" serves to ""substantiat[e]"" defendants' ""efficiency claims,"" leaving this Court with little doubt that AT&T will stay 
on its projected track. Dep't of Justice & Fed. Trade Comm'n, Horizontal Merger Guidelines § 10 (Aug. 19, 2010). Thus, while not 
necessary to my final judgment in this case, defendants have presented persuasive, probative evidence that the merger will 
produce even more efficiencies than those accounted for in this Opinion. As such, no further ""troll[ing] the Internet"" by Mr. 
Quintero would likely convince the Court otherwise ! Tr. 3605:25 (Quintero)."
121,18," Although the Guidelines are not binding on this Court, our Circuit has noted that they are ""a helpful tool, in view of the many 
years of thoughtful analysis they represent, for analyzing proposed mergers."" Anthem, 855 F. 3d at 349 (citing Baker Hughes, 
908 F.2d at 985-86). As the Non-Horizontal Merger Guidelines make reference to concepts contained within the Horizontal 
Merger Guidelines, I will cite to both as appropriate. "
122,19," See also Robert H. Bork, The Antitrust Paradox 227 (2d ed. 1993) (""Vertical mergers may cut sales and distribution costs, 
facilitate the flow of information between levels of the industry ...[,] create economies of scale in management, and so on.""); 
Ernest Gellhorn et al., Antitrust Law and Economics 411 (5th ed. 2004) (discussing the ""[v]arious efficiency rationales"" that ""can 
motivate vertical mergers""); cf. National Fuel Gas Supply Corp. v. FERC, 468 F.3d 831, 840, 373 U.S. App. D.C. 351 (D.C. Cir. 
2006) (""[V]ertical integration creates efficiencies for consumers."")."
122,20," The Court therefore declines defendants' invitation to adopt either a per se rule or a presumption that would apply to most 
vertical mergers. See Pre-Tr. Br. of Defs. 29 [Dkt. # 77]. To be sure, the standard for which defendants advocate aligns with the 
views of a number of authorities, including judges from this Circuit. See, e.g., Robert Bork, The Antitrust Paradox 245 (""[I]n the "
123,," absence of a most unlikely proved predatory power and purpose, antitrust should never object to the verticality of any merger.""); 
Comcast Cable Comms., LLC v. FCC, 717 F.3d 982, 990, 405 U.S. App. D.C. 188 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (Kavanaugh, J., concurring) 
(""[A]bsent market power, vertical integration and vertical contracts are procompetitive."") (citing Douglas H. Ginsburg, Vertical 
Restraints: De Facto Legality Under the Rule of Reason, 60 Antitrust L.J. 67, 76 (1991)). Tempting though it may be to agree 
with my appellate brethren, I need not, and will not, go that far to resolve this case. "
124,21," The Government also asserts that a broader market of ""All Video Distribution"" — which includes SVODs in addition to MVPDs 
and virtual MVPDs — constitutes a relevant product market. See Gov't PFOF ¶ 37 (citing Tr. 2184:18-2185:17) (Shapiro). For 
simplicity's sake, this discussion mirrors the Government's focus on the multichannel video distribution market. Cf. Gov't Pre-
Trial Br. 22. "
126,22," For purposes of this section, the Court at times refers to AT&T's collective distribution offerings as ""DirecTV."" "
127,23," On that score, defendants argue that ""even taken at face value, the Government's projected price effects do not state a claim 
under the Clayton Act."" Defs.' PCOL 159 (capitalization altered); see also id. ¶¶ 31-33. In particular, defendants point out that the 
miniscule per-consumer price increases of approximately 27-cents per month relied on by the Government would not prevent 
AT&T's rival distributors from competing in the marketplace or otherwise ""impair[] their ability to discipline"" AT&T's prices; 
indeed, they claim that competition would be promoted by the challenged merger's conceded vertical integration effect of 
lowering AT&T's prices to its projected consumers. Id. ¶¶ 31-32; cf. Comcast Cable Comms., LLC v. FCC, 717 F.3d 982, 990, 
405 U.S. App. D.C. 188 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (Kavanaugh, J., concurring) (""Vertical integration and vertical contracts become 
potentially problematic only when a firm has market power in the relevant market.""). For the reasons given by defendants, the Court harbors serious doubts that the Government's proffered affiliate fee increases to 
AT&T's rivals or the resulting 27-cent per-month subscriber cost increases would, if proven, constitute a ""substantial lessening of 
competition"" for purposes of Section 7. 15 U.S.C. § 18. As just noted, however, I need not rest this opinion on that legal 
conclusion. That is because, for all of the reasons provided in the section that follows, the Government has failed to carry its 
burden to put forward adequate evidence to show that there are likely to be any price increases (much less price increases that 
outweigh the conceded EDM benefits to consumers) either to AT&T's rival distributors or their subscribers under its increased-
leverage theory. "
129,24," The ""must have"" status of Turner content also varies based on whether the content is available for viewing through other 
means, such as over the internet. Former Cable ONE negotiator Randy Sejen testified, for example, that subscriber losses from 
a blackout of Turner's live baseball content were mitigated by the fact that ""consumers were able to wire around"" the blackout by 
""accessing mlb.com if they needed to see a particular playoff game."" Tr. 2117:21-2118:20 (Sejen (CABLE ONE)). Along those 
same lines, Sejen testified that the online availability of March Madness basketball games could potentially ""address the sort of 
must-have nature"" of that content. See id. at 2121:11-16, 2123:1-5. 1 received similar evidence indicating that the availability of "
130,," HBO's content through online, direct-to-consumer platforms has lowered the value of HBO programming — and thus its leverage 
— in the eyes of distributors. See, e.g., DX709. "
131,25," Before proceeding further, the Court notes a bit of confusion in the Government's position about the role of defendants' alleged 
""anticompetitive intent"" in assessing the likely harms associated with the challenged merger. Gov't PCOL ¶ 51. In opening 
arguments, counsel for the Government stated, in reference to the predictive exercised called for by Section 7, that ""courts don't 
focus on intent. What they focus on is effects, effects in the market."" Tr. 10:15-16. But the Government's post-trial brief cites 
cases for the proposition that ""[e]vidence of anticompetitive intent can also form the basis of a court's prediction of harm,"" while 
at the same time noting that ""absence of evidence demonstrating anticompetitive intent . . . suggests nothing."" Gov't PCOL ¶ 51 
& n.12. The Court need not toil to reconcile those positions or parse the state of our Circuit's current case law on the issue. Compare 
Whole Foods Mkt., 548 F.3d at 1047 (Tatel, J., concurring in the judgment) (""[T]he Supreme Court has clearly said that 
'evidence indicating the purpose of the merging parties, where available, is an aid in predicting the probable future conduct of 
the parties and thus the probable effects of the merger."" (emphasis and internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Brown Shoe, 
370 U.S. at 329 n.48)), with id. at 1057 (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting) (""[I]ntent is not an element of a § 7 claim. . . . "" (citing A.A. 
Poultry Farms, Inc. v. Rose Acre Farms, Inc., 881 F.2d 1396, 1402 (7th Cir. 1989)) (""Firms need not like their competitors; they 
need not cheer them on to success; a desire to extinguish one's rivals is entirely consistent with, often is the motive behind, 
competition."")). That is because, as discussed below, here there is nothing akin to the direct, anticompetitive intent evidence of 
the other cases cited by the Government in its post-trial brief."
131,26," Just prior to the close of evidence, when the Government moved the Court to take judicial notice of certain enumerated 
regulatory filings, I noted that the materials filled a notebook that is about ""4 inches thick of paper."" Tr. 3942:4-5. Given the 
complex analyses and arguments contained within the voluminous filings, I noted that the Government was ""at an absolute 
minimum . . . going to have to isolate and identify as to each document which statement or statements"" it thought were relevant 
to the case for purposes of clearing Federal Rule of Evidence (""FRE"") 403. Id. at 3943:23-3944:3. In response, counsel for the 
Government stated that the ""memorandum that I handed up isolates and lists the specific statements, and I'm happy to limit to 
those that are identified on page 3 and 4."" Id. at 3945:11-13. In its post-trial papers, the Government nonetheless appears to 
argue that the entire expert reports appended to the prior regulatory filings are admissible under FRE 801(d)(2) as adoptions of 
defendants. See Gov't PCOL ¶ 54 & n.13. That is largely beside the point, however. That is because the Court declines to admit 
those portions of the proffered expert reports and filings not ""identified on page 3 and 4"" of the Government's motion under FRE 
403. Id. at 3945:11-13. In my judgment, evaluating the complicated, fact-specific arguments and analyses contained with those 
filings and reports would essentially require a trial within a trial (recall that not even the expert reports in this case were offered 
into evidence by the parties), the result of which would produce evidence that is only marginally probative for all of the reasons 
discussed below. "
133,27," The Government takes its regulatory filings argument one step further in its post-trial briefing, asserting, for the first time, that 
defendants' prior regulatory statements should result in them being judicially estopped from denying basic predicates of the 
increased-leverage theory of harm. Gov't PCOL ¶¶ 74-75. To say the least, that argument is a stretch. As the Supreme Court 
has explained, the ""equitable doctrine"" of judicial estoppel may be ""invoked by a court at its discretion"" to guard against a party's 
""improper use of judicial machinery"" to gain an ""unfair advantage."" New Hampshire v. Maine, 532 U.S. 742, 750-51, 121 S. Ct. 
1808, 149 L. Ed. 2d 968 (2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). To appropriately apply judicial estoppel against a party, the 
""party's later position must be 'clearly inconsistent' with its earlier position""; courts also consider whether the party has 
""succeeded in persuading a court to accept that party's earlier position"" or would ""derive an unfair advantage or impose an unfair 
detriment on the opposing party if not estopped."" Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). Applying those factors, I easily conclude that estoppel is not appropriate here. To start, the cited prior regulatory comments are 
not ""clearly inconsistent"" with defendants' current positions: predicting that a different vertical transaction, made at an earlier time 
period and in a less-competitive market, will shift bargaining outcomes is not inconsistent with arguing that the Government has 
failed to carry its burden of proof to show at trial that a different transaction, proposed in the context of an even more competitive 
market, is likely to similarly shift outcomes (much less substantially lessen competition). Maine, 532 U.S. at 750; Jankovic v. Int'l 
Crisis Grp., 822 F.3d 576, 586, 422 U.S. App. D.C. 259 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (declining to apply estoppel when party's position was 
not inconsistent). Although that consideration alone is fatal to the Government's estoppel argument, the Court further notes that 
the equities also weigh against applying estoppel here. The Government investigated the proposed merger for approximately 
one year before filing its suit. Disputes regarding the applicability of an increased-leverage theory as applied to the transaction 
have been front and center in the litigation, and were fully aired at trial. Given all that, I am hard pressed to understand how the 
Government would suffer an ""unfair detriment"" if defendants are not estopped; if anything, it would seem manifestly unfair to 
defendants to accept the Government's post-trial estoppel argument that much of the trial evidence can be ignored and indeed 
substituted with decades-old regulatory filings. Thus, even assuming that estoppel can be applied based on statements 
contained within third-party regulatory comments to prior administrative proceedings, but see Abtew v. U.S. Dep't of Homeland 
Sec., 808 F.3d 895, 899-900, 420 U.S. App. D.C. 356 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (""[T]he rule of judicial estoppel 'generally prevents a party 
from prevailing in one phase of a case on an argument and then relying on a contradictory argument to prevail in another 
phase.'"" (emphasis added) (quoting Maine, 532 U.S. at 749)), the Court declines the Government's last-minute invitation to estop 
defendants here. "
139,28," Indeed, when asked in discovery whether it had a position on whether these transactions affected content prices, the 
Government cited to one FCC study related to the News Corp.-DirecTV transaction and stated that, beyond that study, ""the 
United States does not, at this time, have a position as to whether any prior vertical integration between a programmer and a 
distributor resulted in higher video programming fees"" or ""higher prices for consumers"" than ""would have prevailed absent the 
integration."" DX893-28 to -29."
139,29, One more witness testified to this fact in sealed testimony. Tr. 930:17-18 (SEALED). 
140,30," The parties spent a good deal of the trial debating the finer points of Turner's November 2017 arbitration offer, made shortly 
after the filing of the Complaint in this case. The Government asserts that the arbitration commitment must be ignored or, at the 
very least, must be proven binding and effective by defendants, while defendants describe its absence from Professor Shapiro's 
model as a critical weakness in the model's design and the Government's prima facie case. Compare Gov't Post-Tr. Br. 21-22, 
with Post-Trial Br. of Defs. (""Defs.' Post-Tr. Br."") 14. For purposes of this discussion, as explained below, I have confidence that 
Turner's arbitration offer will have real-world effect and, thus, that it is appropriate to consider Professor Carlton's econometric 
analysis of the Corncast-NBCU transaction. See infra n.51. "
141,31," In response, the Government asks this Court to ignore the import of that testimony from the Comcast and NBCU witnesses on 
the basis that the conditions governing the Comcast-NBCU transaction would have prevented any coordination between the 
programming and distribution components and thus rendered such conversations between the two pointless. See Gov't Post-Tr. 
Br. 19 n.14. Please! The Comcast and NBCU witnesses' testimony aligns with testimony from witnesses not subject to the FCC 
order's conditions and is also entirely consistent, as subsequently discussed, see infra pp. 114-117, with the goal of 
companywide profit maximization. See Tr. 601:10-602:15 (Martin (Turner)); id. at 1129:6-12 (Breland (Turner)); id. at 1190:14-15 
(Warren (Turner)); cf. id. [**142]  at 2102:6-11 (Sejen (Cable ONE)) (""I mean, it doesn't matter to us who owns the network . . . . 
It really doesn't matter.""). For that reason, among others, see infra nn. 34, 36, I decline the Government's invitation to disregard 
the Comcast and NBCU witnesses' testimony referenced in this section. "
142,32," To the extent the Government's increased-leverage theory now leans more heavily for support on the industry witness 
testimony and defendants' documents, as ""framed"" by Professor Shapiro's analysis more generally, Gov't Post-Tr. Br. 8, that 
shift in emphasis fails to salvage its claim given the independent problems with that so-called ""real-world objective evidence"" set 
out in the section above. See supra pp. 75-109; cf. Defs.' Post-Tr. Br. 10 (""But adding zero to zero is hardly a sound way to 
prove a price increase.""). In the Court's view, however, it is worth noting that the Government's retreat from Professor Shapiro's "
143,," model cannot be squared with Professor Shapiro's testimony (seemingly approved by the Government) that to perform a valid 
""vertical merger analysis"" under the applicable ""consumer welfare"" standard, it is necessary to ""balance"" or ""tradeoff"" the 
merger's proconsumer benefits with any predicted consumer harms. See Tr. 2180:8-2181:8, 2182:7-21, 2253:4-5 (Shapiro). At 
trial, that ""somewhat different"" ""balancing"" analysis of the challenged vertical merger was enabled not by the testimony of the 
third-party competitors or defendants' documents and statements, but by the cost-benefit predictions Professor Shapiro 
generated through use of his models. See id. at 2182:17-18, 2252:19-2253:15. For that reason, asking the Government to 
provide sufficient support for the proffered bargaining model is not, as the Government seems to argue, penalizing them for 
failure to quantify the ""specific magnitude of the potential harm,"" Gov't PCOL ¶ 16, but instead is simply part and parcel of what 
Professor Shapiro testified is necessary to determining whether the proposed vertical merger will harm consumers overall."
143,33," On that score, it is notable that, although the Government states that its proffered bargaining model is ""a standard model that 
is in economics textbooks and widely used by economists,"" Gov't PFOF ¶ 202, Professor Shapiro acknowledged that, with 
respect to the model. ""[w]hat's less common is to use it to evaluate a merger or a vertical merger especially,"" Tr. 2390:2-3 
(Shapiro). To support Professor Shapiro's testimony regarding economic bargaining theory and his model, the Government contends that 
defendants' experts ""endorsed"" application of the model generally, but quibbled with the model's inputs. Gov't Post-Tr. Br. 2. 
That characterization is questionable, especially given Professor Carlton's extensive testimony about his conclusion that ""the 
evidence provides no statistical support for the government's claim that prices will rise in this transaction"" — statistical evidence 
that he considers more probative in analyzing the Government's increased-leverage theory than Professor's Shapiro's ""quite . . . 
complicated economic model."" Tr. 2439:19-25, 2441:25 (Carlton); see id. at 2439:22-2441:25. Nonetheless, it is of course the 
Government's burden — not defendants' — to sufficiently link its proffered expert testimony to the underlying facts in the 
industry. It is therefore no surprise that Professor Carlton spent most of his limited time on the stand discussing the econometric 
studies he performed, rather than cataloguing whether the facts adduced at trial support Professor Shapiro's testimony. "
145,34," Witness after witness confirmed that blackouts — and the attendant loss of distribution — have ""massive implications"" for 
Turner. Tr. 1189:13-16 (Warren (Turner)); see also, e.g., id. at 659:22 (Martin (Turner)) (""[I]t's very bad for business to go dark.""); 
id. at 1128:7-1129:4 (Breland (Turner)) (""I lose money the minute I go dark. It can be catastrophic to my business . . . .""); id. at 
3119:22-3120:22 (Bewkes (Time Warner)) (""So if our channels, any of them, are not in some distribution offering, that's 
catastrophic for us. We lose a lot of money. . . . Due to the size of most of our distributors, hundreds of millions of dollars.""). 
During Turner's one-month blackout with DISH in 2014, for example, Turner lost ""[n]orth of 30 million dollars"" in subscriber fees 
and advertising revenue. Id. at 1115:2 (Breland (Turner)). In order to end the blackout, Turner agreed to a temporary affiliate 
agreement extension that released DISH from any obligation to pay $120 million in audit monies that Turner believed it was 
owed. Id. at 1118:15-19. Turner agreed to cede those funds, Turner executive Coleman Breland testified, because Turner was 
""bleeding"" and ""losing a tremendous amount of money"" during the blackout. Id. at 1118:23-24. Given all that, it is perhaps 
unsurprising that, for all of the testimony about the ""very intense and aggressive"" nature of affiliate negotiations, id. at 3251:24-
25 (Stankey (AT&T)), Professor Shapiro testified that Turner has never experienced a long-term blackout with a distributor, see 
id. at 2357:12-14 (Shapiro)."
145,35," To understand why, note that Professor Shapiro's opinion incorporates the ""key"" recognition that each side's bargaining 
leverage ""is based on what would happen if there were no deal."" Tr. 2193:16-18 (Shapiro). Simply stated, if a party's alternative 
to striking a deal improves, that party is more willing and able to push harder for a better deal because it faces less downside 
risk if the deal implodes. Professor Shapiro gave an example of negotiations between a seller and buyer of a used car; he noted 
that if the seller's next-best offer improves, he will be able to extract a higher price from the original buyer. See id. at 2213:2-10. 
The bargaining concept the example demonstrates, Professor Shapiro explained, is that ""you have more leverage now because 
you have a better offer. And you will be more . . . willing to apply that leverage. And some of them are willing to walk away, if 
necessary. . . . [B]etter outside offers make one party stronger in those negotiations."" Id. at 2213:13-20. Unlike the car seller, 
who might be ""willing to walk away"" and accept his alternative offer to sell the car for a gain, however, id. at 2213:15-16, the 
evidence at trial indicated that Turner would not be willing to accept the ""catastrophic"" affiliate fee and advertising losses 
associated with a long-term blackout, id. at 1128:10 (Breland (Turner)); see supra pp. 14-18."
145,36," The Court finds Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes' response to a question regarding the increased-leverage theory to be 
particularly persuasive: ""And the way I — I think it's best the way to understand it, is if we have a risk that a thousand-pound 
weight might fall on us — we hope it doesn't, but if that's always there, then if you said to me, well, don't worry; it might be a 950- "
146,," pound weight instead of a thousand pounds, are you going to think about it differently, feel differently? Are you going to take 
more risk that any of that might happen to you? Absolutely not."" Tr. 3120:23-3121:7 (Bewkes (Time Warner)). Although not 
controlling, the Court notes that some of Turner's lead negotiators credibly testified to similar effect. See, e.g., id. at 1128:7-12 
(Breland (Turner)) (""The concept that Turner would push"" as though ""going dark is good for us, I believe I've given examples 
today of why it's just the opposite. I lose money the minute I go dark. . . .""); id. at 1190:14-17 (Warren (Turner)) (answering, 
when asked whether could gain leverage by ""threatening to blackout distributors,"" that ""I don't think that's a realistic 
perspective.""). On the stand, Professor Shapiro attempted to support his increased-leverage proposition by noting that programmers and 
distributors ""think about what'll happen if there's a blackout"" when formulating their negotiating strategy. See id. at 2193:23-
2194:13 (Shapiro). The Government does the same in its post-trial filings. See, e.g., Gov't PFOF ¶¶ 124-153 (collecting 
evidence to support proposition that ""MVPDs have estimated their likely subscriber losses to inform their negotiating strategy""). 
The evidence showed that distributors engage in that exercise ""with varying degrees of sophistication."" Id. ¶ 124. With respect to 
companies that perform ""go dark"" analyses of the potential consequences of a blackout, the bulk of the evidence showed that 
negotiators relied on those analyses to get a general sense of ""the value"" of a programmer's content by measuring how many 
customers they would lose in the event of a blackout - customer losses that, notably, are not going to change as a result of the 
merger. See Tr. 935:12-16, 936:23 (SEALED); see id. at 1349:15-19 (Montemagno (Charter)) (reviewed the ""high points"" of the 
Altman Vilandrie go-dark analysis ""[v]ery briefly""); id. at 1094:21-1095:1 (Breland (Turner)) (although ""you never want to go dark 
if you are a programmer,"" preparing for a go dark scenario is ""just prudent math""). Contrary to Professor Shapiro and the 
Government's arguments, such high-level evidence does not provide support for the more specific prediction that a marginal 
improvement in Turner's (still unprofitable) position in a blackout would meaningfully alter Turner's bargaining leverage. In a similar way, the Government seeks to rely on the testimony of Turner executive Coleman Breland for the proposition that 
""Turner bargains over price down to hundredths of a penny,"" Gov't PFOF ¶ 108, and that Turner ""almost went dark with Time 
Warner Cable over a single penny increase on one channel in 2012,"" id. ¶ 158. That account of Breland's testimony is 
""misleading at best."" Defs.' PFOF 38 n.5. For the reasons set out in Defendants' proposed findings of fact, see id., Breland's 
testimony does not bolster Professor Shapiro's model."
146,37," Technically, Professor Shapiro used two models. He first used an economic bargaining model to generate predicted affiliate 
fee increases to distributors; then, he plugged those distributor cost increases into a separate merger simulation model to 
generate his estimates for consumer cost increases. See Tr. 2314:17-25 (Shapiro). As defendants' arguments focus on the 
design of Professor Shapiro's bargaining model rather than the merger simulation model, I will refer only to the bargaining 
model. "
147,38," Correcting for those faults, defendants argue, would cause Professor Shapiro's model to predict a net benefit to consumers on 
account of the merger. Specifically, Professor Carlton testified that when one updates or accounts for those four factors — the 
long-term subscriber loss rate, the diversion rate, the margin data, and the presence of contracts — Professor Shapiro's model 
generates an average 52-cent per-month, per-consumer benefit rather than an average 27-cent per-month, per-consumer harm. 
See Tr. 2516:2-6 (Carlton); see also id. at 2255:9-25 (Shapiro) (testifying about the ""[p]redicted Turner monthly fee increases for 
consumers"" reflected by PDX11, slide 11). The large effects on the predicted net harm created by minor changes to Professor Shaprio's inputs raises a separate question 
regarding the model's sensitivity. As Professor Carlton noted, Professor Shapiro performed no ""statistical tests"" to demonstrate 
that the ""tiny percentage"" increases in harm predicted by his model are ""any different from zero"" statistically speaking. Id. at 
2450:16-2451:12 (Carlton). Without such statistical testing, Professor Carlton testified, the predicted harms could fall within the 
range of zero ""just because of normal fluctuations in how we estimate models in the perimeters [sic] of the model."" Id. The fact 
that Professor Shapiro's model ""cannot be proven to any statistical significance"" provides this Court with additional cause to 
reject the model's conclusions as ""persuasive"" evidence. FTC v. Swedish Match, 131 F. Supp. 2d 151, 161 (D.D.C. 2000). "
148,39, The Government did not recall any Altman Vilandrie witnesses on rebuttal to answer to Professor Rossi's critiques. 
149,40," Although Professor Rossi explained that Altman Vilandrie relied in part on the Sawtooth Software, which incorporates some of 
his own innovations in survey methodology, the combination procedure took place ""outside of Sawtooth Software."" Tr. 2855:20-
2856:6 (Rossi). "
151,41," Professor Shapiro omitted from his analysis of industry trends December 2016 data that showed an even steeper decline in 
industry subscribership. When first questioned about the decision not to include this data in his analysis, Professor Shapiro did 
not recall that any data was omitted, and could not provide an explanation for that omission. See Tr. 3879:1-14 (Shapiro). When 
called back to the stand days later, Professor Shapiro recalled that he had noticed something ""peculiar"" about the omitted 
numbers. Id. at 3915:9. Professor Shapiro's testimony concerning the 2016 data was not the only time that he demonstrated a 
lack of familiarity with the materials he presented to the Court. See infra pp. 127-129, 139-140. To be clear, although both call 
into question his analysis, Professor Shapiro's lack of familiarity with the contents of his report and with his own data analysis 
presents a credibility problem separate from the problems with key inputs generated by outside sources like Altman Vilandrie."
151,42," Pursuant to the parties' representations and agreements during an April 26, 2018 bench conference related to the Suddenlink 
analysis, the Court will strike the following lines of trial testimony from Professor Shapiro: Tr. 3926:12-13; Tr. 3917:5-7; Tr. 
3878:9-10; Tr. 3877:20-21; Tr. 3806:10-12. "
152,43," Professor Rossi also criticized Professor Hauser for failing: 1) to establish that his group of survey participants constituted a 
representative sample of the population of interest, and 2) to provide a margin of error that is, a measure of reliability—for his 
survey's results. See Tr. 2771:22-2273:21, 2775:2-6 (Rossi). Although the Court agrees that those problems are notable, it sees 
no need to pile on by addressing them further in light of the two significant design flaws discussed below."
152,44," This is not the first time Professor Hauser's ""graphic effects and presentation methods"" have been called into question on this 
basis. See Apple, Inc. v. Samsung Elecs. Co., No. 11-CV-01846-LHK, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29721, 2014 WL 976898, at *10-
*16 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 6, 2014). "
153,45," The miniscule nature of subscriber losses resulting from the two actual instances of Turner blackouts perhaps should have 
alerted Professor Shapiro that something was awry with his sources. The evidence showed that there have been two short-term 
blackouts of Turner content with distributors: 1) a thirty-day blackout with Cable ONE in October 2013, which resulted in ""fairly 
insignificant"" subscriber losses in the range of about .6%, Tr. 2116:10-13, 2127:21-2128:2 (Sejen (Cable ONE)); and 2) a thirty-
day blackout with DISH in November 2014, in which some Turner networks — including CNN, but not TBS or TNT — were 
blacked out, resulting in a loss of less than 1% of DISH subscribers, see id. at 388:10-389:5 (Schlichting (DISH)). Those 
subscriber loss figures simply cannot be squared with some of the figures represented in the sources upon which Professor 
Shapiro relied. "
154,46," Because the evidence does not support use of Professor Shapiro's 9% ""low end"" long-term subscriber loss rate, it stands to 
reason that the larger 14% long-term subscriber loss rate he used to generate the high end of his predicted harm range is also 
unsupported. Tr. 3851:21-3852:8 (Shapiro). The same goes for the higher 12% and 16% long-term subscriber loss rates he 
used, rather curiously and contrary to the Altman Vilandrie slide deck upon which he claimed to rely, to generate the predicted 
harms for a 2017 and 2021 market configuration. See Tr. 2493:9-2495:18 (Carlton). Professor Shapiro's appeal to the fact that 
he predicted a range of harm is therefore unavailing: He is not ""suffering the consequences of being conservative"" in his 
estimates, Tr. 3852:1-2 (Shapiro), the consequences arise because even his conservative estimate lacks sufficient evidentiary 
support and reliability. The same can be said for the Government's post-trial submissions regarding the ""conservative[]"" nature of 
Professor Shapiro's analysis. Gov't Post-Tr. Br. 14. "
155,47," To be sure, the Government, through the rebuttal testimony of Professor Shapiro, attempted to rebuff Professor Carlton's 20% 
cord-cutting rate. Professor Shapiro pointed out that, in the context of examining the consequences of a Turner blackout, it is 
""pretty likely"" that a departing customer would ""want to go somewhere else where you can get the Turner content."" Tr. 3808:11-
12 (Shapiro). Thus, Professor Shapiro continued, stating that ""20 percent of American households don't have pay-TV service"" 
overall is ""beside the point."" Id. at 3808:5-6, 15. Were it defendants' obligation to provide sufficient support for the departure rate 
in Professor Shapiro's model, rather than Professor Shapiro's, that rebuff would perhaps be persuasive. But even accepting 
Professor Shapiro's point about defendants' proposed rate, that point does not prove that the departure rate he proffered had 
adequate evidentiary support. "
156,48," Specifically, David Christopher testified to the June 2017 LTV figure during his deposition on February 14, 2018. See Tr. 
3002:16-25. Although Professor Shapiro's report cites Christopher's deposition, on the stand Professor Shapiro admitted that he 
did not read that deposition transcript and did not in fact know David Christopher's role in the case. See id. at 2345:17-2346:3 
(Shapiro) (""Q: If I told you that you cited to [Christopher's] deposition in your report, does that ring a bell? A: No. Q: Well, did you 
read his deposition? A: I did not.""). "
157,49," With his model's original reliance on the 2016 LTVs under attack, Professor Shapiro's rebuttal testimony doubled down on an 
argument relating to the value of AT&T's existing customers. The argument proceeds as follows. In addition to calculating LTVs 
for newly acquired video customers, AT&T assigns margin values to its existing video subscribers. Those values, known as 
active customer values (""ACVs""), are generally higher than LTVs because they do not account for ""subscriber acquisition costs."" 
Tr. 3854:22-3855:4 (Shapiro). Professor Shapiro's long-term subscriber loss rate includes a measure of the existing customers 
that AT&T will retain as a result of a long-term Turner blackout on its distribution rivals. The value of those maintained 
customers, Professor Shapiro opines, is likely ""50 percent higher"" than the margin value for new-customers. Id. at 2244:13-21. 
Professor Shapiro did not, however attempt to generate or otherwise assign a ""measure of the margin on the retained 
subscribers."" Id. at 2244:9-10. Instead, his model only incorporates the margin value associated with new subscribers. Id. at 
2244:22. As a result, Professor Shapiro states that his ""margin figure is definitely understated and substantially understated 
because I don't have the proper data on the value of the retained customers."" Id. at 2244:14-17. Therein lies the problem. Although opining about the importance of the value of retained customers to AT&T, Professor Shapiro 
undertook no analysis to incorporate that overall effect into his model. That should come as little surprise, given that this ""larger 
point"" appeared only in footnote 414 of the ninth appendix to Professor Shapiro's 300-page expert report; nonetheless, it renders 
his reliance on the existing-versus-new customer distinction unconvincing. Id. at 3809:18, 3855:5-3856:5. That footnote, 
Professor Shapiro testified, indicates that ""the value of existing subscribers [is] between 150 and 225 percent as large as new 
subscribers."" Id. at 3813:13-17. Beyond footnote 414's general observation, Professor Shapiro did not attempt to quantify the 
total dollar value of existing customers' margins versus new customer margins, much less incorporate a figure for existing 
customer margins into his model. Id. at 2244:22-2245:1 (""But, again, the data I have available, I'm using those gross add 
margins.""). On rebuttal, Professor Shapiro nonetheless cited that ""higher number"" as ""what gives me a higher end of my range"" 
of projected harm. Id. at 3819:25-3820:7. That does not appear to be the case: elsewhere, Professor Shapiro testified that the 
""higher end"" of the range derives from his use of a higher long-term subscriber loss rate of 14% (as compared to the 9% rate he 
chose to present to the Court during his direct testimony), rather than any alterations to other inputs, such as the margin data. Id. 
at 2259:4-8 (""I realize there are ranges here. These are based on, we're starting from the low end, 9 percent subscriber loss 
rate, and projecting that. So if we started with the 14 percent, we'd have higher numbers.""); see also id. at 2239:3-7. Professor 
Shapiro's belated attempts to link his point regarding the increased margins for existing customers to the high-end projections he 
reported, or to present those increased margins as if they were quantified and incorporated into his model, are thus unavailing 
and further undermine the credibility of his presentation."
157,50," The primary exception is Charter, which has been displaying Turner content pursuant to temporary, short-term extensions of 
the companies' affiliate agreement, which initially expired in 2016. See Tr. 1353:21-1354:3 (Montemagno (Charter)). "
159,51," Although they amount to ""extra icing on a cake already frosted,"" there are even more reasons to be skeptical of the 
Government's increased-leverage theory of competitive harm. Yates v. United States, 135 S. Ct. 1074, 1093, 191 L. Ed. 2d 64 
(2015) (Kagan, J., dissenting). First, the Court has reason to believe that, post-merger, AT&T will honor Turner's commitment to arbitrate, counterparties will 
agree to the terms of that commitment, and the prospect of arbitration will influence affiliate negotiations. In short, the 
commitment, made by Turner shortly after the filing of this suit, will have real-world effects. For starters, the proposed arbitration 
agreement is similar ""in many of the fundamental ways"" to the arrangement blessed by the DOJ, FCC, and this Court in the 
Comcast-NBCU merger. Tr. 2680:1-9 (Katz); see also 7/27/2011 Hr'g Tr. 7:4-7, 13:6-10, Comcast Corp., 808 F. Supp. 2d 145. 
Record evidence confirmed the real-world impact of an arbitration provision of this kind, giving the Court confidence both that 
arbitration offer will have import to negotiations and would be accepted by Turner's counterparties. See supra pp. 100-105 
(reviewing econometric analysis of affiliate-agreement prices after the Comcast-NBCU merger); see also Tr. 1388:18-22 
(Montemagno (Charter)) (testifying to effects of arbitration in NBCU negotiations); id. at 2017:12-15 (Bond (NBCU)) (similar); id. 
at 121:14-122:9 (Fenwick (Cox)) (confirming that Cox had proposed arbitration ""[j]ust like in Comcast case"" as condition to this 
merger); id. at 464:17-20 (Schlichting (DISH)) (similar). Given its trial presentation, I am hard-pressed to conclude that AT&T 
would (much less could) retreat from the commitment in light of the apparent reputational costs of doing so — costs that would 
imperil future negotiations in a marketplace with repeat players. See, e.g., id. at 3261:23-3262:3 (Stankey (AT&T)); cf. id. at 
2622:4-2624:1 (Carlton). Contrary to the Government's insinuations about the reasons for the arbitration offer, moreover, the Court does not view the offer 
as akin to an admission by defendants that the proposed merger would lead to the anticompetitive harms that the Government 
posits. Cf id. at 39:1-5 (Gov't Opening). Instead, the Court credits John Stankey's and Randall Stephenson's testimony that the 
commitment was intended to ""put our money where our mouth is"" in showing that the proposed merger, far from being aimed at 
""do[ing] any of the things that the government allege[s],"" is instead a ""vision deal"" being pursued to achieve ""lower prices, 
improved quality, enhanced service, [and] new products."" Id. at 3261:16-3262:3 (Stankey (AT&T)); id at 3402:3 (Stephenson 
(AT&T)); see also id. at 3467:18-3468:9 (Stankey (AT&T)); id. at 3395:23-25 (Stephenson (AT&T)); supra pp. 36-40. Second, the Court observes that the Government's increased-leverage theory fails to account for another feature of the market, 
namely the FCC's program access rules. As defendants' expert, Professor Katz, testified, those rules are calculated to prevent 
precisely the kind of harm predicted by the Government: a vertically integrated entity discriminatorily increasing programming 
prices on its distributor-rivals. See Tr. 2693:14-2694:5 (Katz) (""They wanted to make sure that somehow control of the 
programmer wasn't used to harm competition.""); 47 U.S.C. § 548(b), (j); 47 C.F.R. § 76.1001(b)(1)(i)-(ii); see 47 U.S.C. § 
548(c)(2). Those regulations are a proper subject of antitrust analysis, see Verizon Comms Inc. v Law Offices of Curtis V. Trinko, 
LLP, 540 U.S. 398, 411-12, 124 S. Ct. 872, 157 L. Ed. 2d 823 (2004), and appear to be squarely on-point, at least according to 
the unrebutted testimony of Professor Katz. See Tr. 2693:19-2694:1 (Katz) (""[T]here are two broad categories. One category . . . 
prohibits discrimination against different distributors. And the other broad category prohibits the distributor from having undue 
influence on the decisions of the programmer. So, again, the idea of you don't want the distributor telling the programmer to go 
do things to harm other distributors.""). Nevertheless, the Government all but wishes them away — and does so with little 
explanation or, more importantly, record evidence. "
160,52," It will come as no surprise that a basic premise of the virtual claims — as for the Government's increased-leverage theory — is 
the literal ""must have"" nature of Turner programming. For all the reasons stated earlier in this opinion, the Court is skeptical that, 
in the Government's words, virtual MVPDs are ""dependent on programmers"" like Turner. Gov't PFOF ¶ 17. For instance, Sling, 
the most successful virtual MVPD, offers a package without broadcast stations and does not offer CBS at all. See Tr. 351:12-25 
(Schlichting (DISH)). As Sling President Warren Schlichting explained, the whole point of virtual MVPDs like Sling, in fact, is to 
carry fewer channels. See id. at 236:2-6 (""Q. Do you carry all the same channels as other pay-TV services? A. Certainly not all 
of them. One of the places that we tried to innovate is to carry fewer channels, many fewer channels.""). "
161,53," To the extent the Government seeks to recycle these statements for purposes of its coordination theory, this evidence is 
unpersuasive on that count, too. The combined entity would stand to gain much from wide distribution of Time Warner content to 
virtual MVPDs, and stand to lose much by refusing to do so. The Government's remaining fact evidence similarly fails to 
establish any incentive to act, unilaterally or coordination, to stifle virtual MVPDs. To the extent the Government seeks to recycle 
the slide deck, PX184, PX543, or Schlichting's testimony for its virtual claims, that evidence remains of limited probative value 
for the reasons stated above. See supra pp. 86-88 (PX184, PX543); see supra pp. 75-78 (Schlichting testimony). Nor does 
additional speculation of third parties, see Gov't PFOF ¶¶ 291-292, or testimony as to the ""importan[ce]"" of Turner content to 
virtual MVPDs, see id. ¶¶ 293-294 — even if presented for the first time in this section — move the needle. Altogether, the best 
the Government could marshal was a statement from AT&T's John Stankey that ""we kind of expected [Sling] might be 
concerned about"" AT&T attacking their skinny bundle. See Tr. 3256:3-15. Such evidence, on its own or in combination, simply "
162,," cannot countermand the prime directive of programming — broad distribution — not to mention AT&T's independent incentive to 
grow video consumption on its wireless network, see supra pp. 153-155."
162,54," In support of the notion that virtual MVPDs need Turner networks (again, in the most literal sense), the Government points to a 
statement by John Martin, Turner's Chairman and CEO, that Sling would be ""shit without Turner."" Gov't PFOF ¶ 156 (quoting 
PX4). This statement does not accomplish the work that the Government thinks it does. For starters, as discussed above, the 
very ""skinny bundle"" concept embraces fewer networks — even fewer popular ones — with the knowledge that some consumers 
will welcome the trade of fewer networks for a lower subscription fee. And second, it should come as no surprise that — even in 
colorful language — executives would be avid boosters for their companies' products. In the final analysis, the Government's 
repeated use of this John Martin quote, see Tr. 12:3-7 (Gov't Opening), 17-18 (Gov't Closing), calls to the mind one Court's 
admonition ""rummage[ing] through business records"" for ""tidbits that will sound impressive (or aggressive)"" undermines efforts to 
ensure ""accuracy of decisions."" A.A. Poultry Farms, Inc., 881 F.2d at 1402. "
163,55," The Government insists that it need not introduce quantitative evidence in support of the coordinated effects theory. See Gov't 
PCOL ¶ 71. The suggestion, of course, is that the Court should steer clear of imposing a requirement that the Government make 
a numbers-based showing on coordinated effects. Let me be clear. The Government here has failed to carry its burden on the 
coordination theory not because there is some per se requirement of quantitative analysis. Rather, the Government has failed to 
carry its burden because it has not put forward persuasive evidence — in any form — that AT&T and Comcast have the 
incentive or, given market constraints, the ability to coordinate in the manner predicted. There is one more point. The cases cited by the Government do involve quantitative showings. In each one, the Court made or 
adopted a threshold quantitative assessment as to market concentration. See H & R Block, 833 F. Supp. 2d at 71-72 (applying 
Herfindahl-Hirschmann Index to determine market concentration); OSF Healthcare, 852 F. Supp. 2d at 1078-80 (same); see also 
Hosp. Corp., 807 F.2d at 1384 (accepting ""FTC's figures"" as to ""highly concentrated market""). That determination, in turn, 
triggered the ""'ordinary presumption of collusion' that attaches to a merger in a highly concentrated market."" H & R Block, 833 F. 
Supp. 2d at 77 (quoting Heinz, 246 F.3d at 725). And with that presumption in place, the burden shifted to defendants to rebut 
the case by ""produc[ing] evidence of 'structural market barriers to collusion' specific to [the relevant] industry that would defeat"" 
the presumption. Id. (quoting Heinz, 246 F.3d at 725). Thus, the Government's insinuation that past coordinated-effects 
challenges were tried without resort to quantitative analysis is simply misleading. In short, the Government cannot evade its 
burden of proof on the ""ultimate issue [of] whether the challenged acquisition is likely to facilitate collusion,"" Hosp. Corp., 807 
F.2d at 1384; Gov't PCOL ¶ 71, by simply stating that it ""does not need to quantify the potential harm,"" Gov't PCOL ¶ 71. "
165,56," In support of its coordination theory, the Government points to past communication between Dan York of AT&T and 
counterparts at other distributors in the Los Angeles market concerning the Sportsnet LA network. See Gov't PFOF ¶¶ 311-312; 
Tr. 2081:9-2081:16 (York (AT&T)); PX462. These instances are only weakly probative of future coordination, involving, as they 
do, a different market, distinctive factual setting, and different distributors. In all respects, this evidence cannot overcome AT&T's 
strong disincentives to coordinate with Comcast detailed in this section. Cf. H & R Block, 833 F. Supp. 2d at 77-78 (detailing 
""highly persuasive historical act of cooperation"" between the same two parties at the center of post-merger coordination 
allegations). The same goes for inquiries by York concerning Verizon Fios packages or evidence regarding John Harran's 
conversations with his counterpart and ""good friend"" at NBCU. See Defs.' PFOF ¶ 291; Gov't PFOF ¶ 313."
165,57," In its proposed conclusions of law, the Government describes its theory that the merged entity might ""restrict the use of HBO 
as a competitive tool."" Gov't PCOL ¶ 61; see also Tr. 3993:7-10 (Gov't Closing) (""It means that if this merger goes forward, then 
the combined firm could limit the use of HBO as a competitive tool, if that competition threatens to impact AT&T.""). Under this 
theory, HBO is a ""competitive tool"" insofar as it is used by distributors for discounts, promotions, marketing, and ad campaigns. 
See Gov't PCOL ¶ 61 (predicting that AT&T will have an incentive ""to restrict the use of HBO as a competitive tool, and thereby 
impair the competitive process and deny consumers the benefits of discounted HBO and other promotions"" (emphasis added)); 
see also Gov't PFOF ¶ 234 (""Overall, HBO is a highly valuable brand, which currently engages in significant promotional 
activities with MVPDs, both AT&T and its rivals.""). This is consistent with the way in which Professor Shapiro viewed the theory. 
See Tr. 2290:25-2291:3 (Shapiro) (""Q. The only theory of harm that you considered relating to HBO is this issue that perhaps 
some promotional, some promotion of HBO might be curtailed, right? A. That's fair.""). It is also consistent with the way in which 
the Government's Complaint and Pre-Trial Brief characterized the theory. See Compl. ¶ 39 (""MVPDs ... today use HBO as a tool 
to entice new customers and to dissuade unhappy customers from leaving and switching to a rival MVPD.... After the merger, 
however, the merged firm would have the incentive and ability, through contractual restrictions, to impede rival MVPDs from 
using HBO to compete against AT&T/DirecTV.""); Gov't Pre-Trial Br. 39 (""HBO could limit approvals for the use of HBO in 
marketing and promotions by DirecTV's rivals in a number of ways, including forms of subtle or targeted obstruction.""). The Government's proposed findings of fact, like its closing argument, appear to advance a considerably broader theory on the 
ways in which HBO could limit the terms of its distribution post-merger. Such a theory would go well beyond restricting 
promotion-related terms. See Gov't PFOF ¶ 267 (listing ways in which HBO could restrict distributors' offerings of HBO to 
customers); Tr. 3975:11-19 (Gov't Closing) (same). Most troubling is the Government's suggestion, based solely on the 
testimony of Martin Hinson of Cox, that the combined entity could ""withhold[] HBO entirely."" Gov't PFOF ¶ 267 (citing Tr. 703:25-
704:18 (Hinson (Cox)). Professor Shapiro himself disavowed this very theory of withholding HBO content: ""Q. You don't claim 
that post-merger HBO will be withheld from any MVPD, correct? A. Correct."" Tr. 2290:15-18 (Shapiro). Professor Shapiro 
similarly disavowed any claim that HBO's price would increase on account of the merger. See id. at 2290:21-23. For the reasons discussed in this Part, the Government has failed to prove that the merged entity has an incentive to restrict rival 
distributors' use of HBO for promotions. To the extent that the Government suggests that AT&T will withhold HBO content "
166,," altogether, will delay access to HBO content, will increase penetration rate requirements, or will engage in any other potentially 
anticompetitive conduct that falls outside the proffered promotion-withholding scheme, the Court holds that, in light of the sparse 
supporting evidence and Professor Shapiro's disavowal of those theories, the Government has failed to meet its burden of proof 
that such conduct would likely result from the proposed merger."
166,58," As an add-on, HBO is low-hanging fruit for customers looking to shave monthly cable bills. Cf. Tr. 2137:3-6 (Sejen (Cable 
ONE)). This results in high ""churn,"" making HBO that much more reliant on promotions to maintain subscriptions. See id. at 
2316:10-12; id. at 2972:20-24 (Holanda (RCN)). In these promotions, HBO depends on distributors because ""the distributor . . . 
owns the relationship with the customer."" Id. at 1528:22-1529:4 (Patel (AT&T))."
166,59," The Court is aware that, in the most technical sense, HBO has the ""ability"" to withhold certain promotions by way of its 
contract-based approval process, under which HBO must bless distributors' use of HBO trademarks and talent for us in 
promotions. This fact alone, however, does not establish that AT&T would be able to ""impair the competitive process."" Gov't 
PCOL ¶ 61. For its theory, the Government must also show that HBO has an incentive to act anticompetitively and that only 
""inferior, inadequate, or more costly"" substitutes for HBO promotions exist in the marketplace, id. ¶ 62 (citation omitted). The 
Government has failed to make these showings."
166,60," After a trial replete with evidence on evolving, hyper-competitive marketplace conditions, the notion that Netflix is an adequate 
substitute for HBO should come as no surprise. ""There was a time."" HBO President Simon Sutton explained, ""when very few 
people were making the kinds of shows we make [at HBO]. Now, it seems like almost every week, there's an announcement of 
somebody else making it."" Tr. 1494:13-21. Netflix now has a programming budget that more than doubles HBO's, id. at 3099:13-
15 (Bewkes (Time Warner)), and Netflix and HBO openly compete ""in many different ways,"" including for ""the talent to make the 
same shows,"" id. at 1493:18-1494:3 (Sutton (HBO)). And when measured by number of subscribers, both Netflix and Amazon "
167,," are ""eclipsing HBO."" DX709-3. Indeed, one of the Government's experts, in an improper communication sent to Government 
attorneys during the course of his testimony in violation of the Court's witnesses rule, forwarded a YouTube video describing 
Netflix as one of the ""top-ten ... monopolists you've never heard of."" See Tr. 3602:17-3603:7, 3604:7-25 (Quintero). Put simply, 
HBO is in the fight of its life !"
167,61," The Government appears to suggest that incentive to engage in anticompetitive conduct — without any demonstration as to 
the probability of acting on that incentive — is sufficient reason to block a proposed merger. See Gov't PCOL ¶ 61 (""In this 
action, the effect of the merger may be to lessen competition substantially by incentivizing the merged firm to restrict the use of 
HBO as a competitive tool, and thereby impair the competitive process and deny consumers the benefits of discounted HBO and 
other promotions.""). This proposition seems impossible to square with the legal standards governing Section 7 actions, which 
require a probability of anticompetitive effects. See supra pp. 50-52 & n.16. Because the Government has failed to establish that 
the merged entity will have any incentive to withhold HBO promotional rights, the Court need not answer the question whether 
the existence of such an incentive, without more, would be sufficient to show that the proposed merger would substantially 
lessen competition for purposes of Section 7."

those causes of action brought in the FAC, as an Opposition is not the appropriate vehicle for asserting new claims or facts.

189,1," The Ministry told the District Court: For much of the 20th century, China allowed only state-owned entities to export products. 
App. to Pet. for Cert. 198a. When China started to allow private enterprises to obtain export licenses, the Ministry established 
the Chamber to regulate exports under the Ministry’s authority and direction. Ibid. In 1997, the Ministry authorized the establishment of the Chamber’s Vitamin C Subcommittee. Id., at 202a. That year, the 
Ministry promulgated a regulation authorizing and requiring the subcommittee to limit the production of vitamin C for export and 
to set export prices. Id., at 202a-204a. Under the regulation delineating this “Export Licensing System,” the Ministry issued 
export licenses only to manufacturers whose export volume and price complied with the output quota and price coordinated by 
the Vitamin C Subcommittee. Id., at 204a. In 2002, the Ministry replaced the Export Licensing System with a “Verification and Chop System.” Id., at 208a. As set forth in a 
2002 Ministry Notice, the Chamber itself—instead of the Ministry—would inspect each export contract and certify its compliance 
with the coordinated quotas and price by affixing a special seal, known as a “chop.” Id., at 208a-209a. China’s Customs would 
allow export only if the exporter presented its contract bearing the Chamber’s “chop.” Id., at 209a. According to the Ministry, it "
190,," was implicit in this arrangement that vitamin C exporters would remain under an obligation to fix prices and volumes. Id., at 
208a. The effect of China’s regime on the Chinese sellers’ liability under the Sherman Act, we note, is not an issue before the Court 
today."
190,2," The complaint, the U. S. purchasers emphasized, was directed only at conduct occurring after December 2001. As they 
understood the Ministry’s 2002 Notice, see supra, at 3, n. 1, vitamin C exporters could have lawfully opted out of price fixing. 
Beyond that, the Vitamin C Subcommittee had replaced its 1997 Charter with a new 2002 Charter, App. 182-197, which 
eliminated the 1997 Charter’s requirement that subcommittee members “[s]trictly execute” the “coordinated price” set by the 
Chamber, compare id., at 85, with id., at 185, and granted members an express “[r]igh[t]” to “freely resign from the

confirm his intent to accept the offer within 14 days. See Doc. No. 14-7 at 2. However, page six of the agreement expressly 
states that in order for Plaintiff to accept the proposal, he must: (1) sign the agreement; (2) fax the executed agreement to 
Ocwen; (3) pay the full initial payment; (4) pay the new monthly payment starting on November 1, 2015; and (5) send proof of 
insurance coverage. See id. at 6. Plaintiff, however, does not allege that he signed the agreement, faxed the executed 
agreement, remitted payment, or submitted proof of insurance coverage. "
199,3," Ocwen also argues that Plaintiff lacks standing to sue under the UCL because Plaintiff fails to allege that he lost money or 
property as a result of the conduct he challenges. See Doc. No. 14-1 at 8-9. ""To have standing to assert a Section 17200 claim, 
the plaintiff must '(1) establish a loss or deprivation of money or property sufficient to qualify as injury in fact, i.e., economic 
injury, and (2) show that the economic injury was the result of, i.e., caused by, the unfair business practice or false advertising 
that is the gravamen of the claim.'"" In re Turner, 859 F.3d 1145, 1151 (9th Cir. 2017) (quoting Kwikset Corp. v. Superior Court, 
51 Cal. 4th 310, 120 Cal. Rptr. 3d 741, 246 P.3d 877, 885 (2011)); see also Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 17204. Here, Plaintiff 
claims that as a result of Ocwen's conduct, he has and continues to suffer harm including the possible loss of the subject 
property, loss of the opportunity to pursue foreclosure alternatives, loss of the opportunity to obtain a loan modification, back 
dues and interest that has accrued to date, which would not have accrued but for Ocwen's actions, and the cost and expense of 
the instant litigation. FAC ¶ 54. Such allegations are sufficient to allege standing. See Segura v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 2014 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 143038, No., 2014 WL 4798890, at *8 (C.D. Cal. Sept. 26, 2014) (finding the plaintiffs have standing to pursue 
a UCL claim because the plaintiffs ""allege an injury that affected a property interest"" and ""adequately allege that the practices of 
which they complain are related to some form of loss they may have suffered related to the property[.]""). "

the risk of competition. See also id. at 173 (Roberts, C.J. dissenting) (Under the majority's opinion, ""taking away any chance that

Mot. for Summ. J., at 9 [FTC Doc. 681]. But under this standard, the FTC has to prove much more than the simple fact that a 
reverse payment occurred; it also has to prove that the payment was ""large"" relative to traditional settlement concerns. See In re 
K-Dur Antitrust Litig., No. 01CV1652SRCCLW, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22982, 2016 WL 755623, at *12 (D.N.J. Feb. 25, 2016)

228,142," It can potentially be a problem if brand name manufacturers tweak a drug and pull the older version off the shelf just as a 
generic is about to enter the market. This is the ""product hopping"" referenced above. It is problematic because it extends a 
manufacturer's monopoly at the expense of consumer choice. Again, however, the Retailers were clear that they were not 
pursuing this kind of theory. But even if they were, such an argument would have failed because Solvay never pulled AndroGel 
1% off the shelf. "

231,1, Circuit Judge Mayer participated only in the decisionon the petition for panel rehearing. 
232,1," In Walker Process Equipment, Inc. v. Food Machinery [**3]  & Chemical Corp., the Supreme Court held that the use of a patent 
obtained through intentional fraud on the USPTO to create or preserve a monopoly may expose the patent holder to antitrust 
liability. 382 U.S. 172, 176-77, 86 S. Ct. 347, 15 L. Ed. 2d 247 (1965). This court has summarized that: ""In order to prevail on a 
Walker Process claim, the antitrust-plaintiff must show two things: first, that the antitrust-defendant obtained the patent by 
knowing and willful fraud on the patent office and maintained and enforced the patent with knowledge of the fraudulent 
procurement; and second, all the other elements necessary to establish a Sherman Act monopolization claim."" TransWeb, LLC

244,1, Neither party contends that the legal standard varies for the state law claim. 
248,1," Because this matter is before the Court on a motion to dismiss, the Court must accept as true the allegations set forth in the 
SAC. See Hosp. Bldg. Co. v. Trs. of Rex Hosp., 425 U.S. 738, 740, 96 S. Ct. 1848, 48 L. Ed. 2d 338 (1976)."
248,2," ""Hospitals"" hereinafter refers to both hospitals and other healthcare facilities. "
250,3," Because the Court determined that Plaintiffs failed to sufficiently allege antitrust standing in their FAC, the Court did not 
address the merits of Plaintiffs' claims. The parties now wish to incorporate by reference arguments made in their respective 
briefs regarding Plaintiffs' FAC. As such, the Court cites to such documents where relevant. "
252,4," Defendants do not address Plaintiffs' cumulative exclusionary effect argument, but rather address each of the challenged 
practices in isolation."
252,5," Defendants assert that Plaintiffs cannot show injury-in-fact, as Plaintiffs have alleged no facts to show that they suffered any 
loss prior to May 2015, and, after that date, Plaintiffs refused to abide by the restrictions. Doc. No. 30-1 at 3 n.4. The Court 
disagrees. Plaintiffs specifically allege that they lost opportunities and profits from 2010 to May 2015, and continue to suffer 
harm because other providers solicit Plaintiffs' recruiters, while Defendants are immune from such solicitations. See SAC ¶¶ 
263, 276. As such, the Court finds that Plaintiffs' allegations relating to the no-poaching restraints are sufficient to show injury-in-
fact. "
253,6," Citations to ""Areeda"" refer to PHILLIP E. AREEDA & HERBERT HOVENKAMP, AN ANALYSIS OF ANTITRUST PRINCIPLES AND THEIR 
APPLICATION (4th ed. 2013). "
254,7," In light of the Court's conclusion that Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged antitrust injury, the Court need not address Plaintiffs' 
third theory of antitrust injury mentioned in Plaintiffs' opposition to the instant motion. See Doc. No. 31 at 14."
254,8," ""[T]he analysis under California's antitrust law mirrors the analysis under federal law because the Cartwright Act was modeled 
after the Sherman Act."" Cnty. of Tuolumne v. Sonora Cmty. Hosp., 236 F.3d 1148, 1160 (9th Cir. 2001). ""Thus, if Plaintiffs plead 
a valid Sherman Act claim, they likewise plead a valid Cartwright Act claim."" In re High-Tech Emp. Antitrust Litig., 856 F. Supp. 
2d 1103, 1114 (N.D. Cal. 2012). "
256,9," In opposition to the instant motion, Plaintiffs indicate that they have ""always acknowledged that the agreements between AMN 
and its subcontractors/rival providers can be characterized as vertical arrangements[.]"" Doc. No. 31 at 19. However, Plaintiffs 
explain in their SAC that a joint venture ""is any agreement, vertical or horizontal, by which two independent businesses 
collaborate on a commercial venture in order to develop or furnish products and/or services."" SAC ¶ 136 n.7 (emphasis added). 
As such, the Court does not read Plaintiffs' statement as an admission that Plaintiffs believe the agreements in question are in 
fact, vertical agreements. See also Doc. No. 17 at 2 (""AMN and rival providers participate in legitimate joint-ventures[.]"")."
256,10," ""Naked"" restraints have ""no purpose except stifling of competition."" White Motor v. United States, 372 U.S. 253, 263, 83 S. Ct. 
696, 9 L. Ed. 2d 738 (1963). "
257,11, The parties do not argue that Defendants and their rivals function as a unit or single entity. 
259,12," The Court notes that Defendants assert that Plaintiffs have ""no response to NCAA . . ., where the Supreme Court applied the 
rule of reason, even though the challenged provision restrained the ability of the members to compete on both price and output 
and was not 'necessary' to market the product."" Doc. No. 32 at 7. As explained by the court in In re ATM Fee Antitrust Litig., 
however, ""the Ninth Circuit has since limited the reach of the NCAA decision"" in Freeman. 554 F. Supp. 2d at 1015. The Ninth 
Circuit has imposed ""an additional burden on defendants, who must now prove not only that their venture requires horizontal 
restraints, but also that the particular restraint challenged is ancillary to the venture's legitimate aspects."" Id.; see also Freeman, 
322 F.3d at 1157. For the reasons discussed below, the Court is unable to determine at this stage of the proceedings whether 
the challenged restraints are ancillary to the venture's legitimate aspects. "
261,13," The Court notes that in the FAC, Plaintiffs specifically alleged that the ""employers' cartel constitutes an ongoing, per [*46]  se 
violation of Section 1[.]"" FAC ¶ 239. This allegation differs from the SAC, wherein Plaintiffs claim that by enforcing the no-
poaching restraints and no-hire agreement, Defendants have ""established and operated a non-reciprocal employers' cartel in the 
medical-traveler markets."" SAC ¶ 297. Plaintiffs do not allege in the SAC, unlike in the FAC, that the alleged employers' cartel in 
and of itself constitutes a per se violation of Section 1. "
263,14," Section 2 of the Sherman Act provides, ""[e]very person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or 
conspire with any person or persons, to monopolize ... trade shall be guilty"" of an antitrust violation. 15 U.S.C. § 2. "
264,15," ""Although Brown Shoe involved the challenge of a merger under Section 7 of the Clayton Act, courts have recognized that its 
submarket analysis is equally applicable to claims brought under the Sherman Act."" In re Live Concert Antitrust Litig., 863 F. 
Supp. 2d 966, 984-85 (C.D. Cal. 2012) (citing Thurman Indus., Inc., 875 F.2d at 1375 n.1). "
267,16," Defendants also argue that dismissal is appropriate because Plaintiffs' claim is predicated on antitrust violations, which 
Plaintiffs have ""failed to plead sufficiently."" Id. However, for the reasons set forth above, the Court disagrees and finds 
Defendants' argument unpersuasive. "
268,17," The Court notes that in the SAC, Plaintiffs claim Defendants have ""employed conduct that is unfair, unlawful and/or deceptive."" 
SAC ¶ 355. The Court does not construe Plaintiffs' SAC as asserting a claim under the UCL's fraudulent prong, especially in 
light of the fact that Plaintiffs do not mention ""fraud"" or ""fraudulent"" conduct in support of this cause of action, nor do Plaintiffs 
respond to Defendants' arguments regarding the fraudulent prong of the UCL. "

271,3, Related unredacted documents are filed under seal. (Docs. 79 and 81).
271,4," Except to avoid confusion, the Court will identify CAT as JBT. "
274,5," To the extent this term, or any other term in this opinion, has a disputed meaning relevant to construction of a patent at issue, 
the Court does not construe that term in this opinion. "
275,6," JBT's argument is further addressed in the Court's analysis of JBT's false advertising claims, below."
275,7," Even if the evidence were admissible, it would show only that the customer was hesitant to purchase an auger chiller with new 
features from JBT because the customer had, in the past, been engaged in patent infringement litigation with JBT's sole 
competitor, Morris. That is, the evidence tends to show that Morris's past litigation actions, the customer's awareness that Morris 
had patents protecting some of its products, and the customer's reliance on its own legal team's advice (which might have 
multiple foundations other than Morris's marking) led to the customer's decision to request a JBT auger chiller with no flow reliefs 
in the auger blade. The inadmissible evidence does not show that the customer's decision was caused by Morris's marking of its 
own auger chiller as patented, and reaching that conclusion requires speculation, rather than reasonable inference. "
278,8, All deposition citations use the document's internal pagination.
278,9, JBT's request for additional discovery is addressed later in this opinion. 
288,1," NYU disputes the Union's argument that resolution of the NLRB proceeding would moot the relief NYU is seeking in this 
lawsuit. (See Dkt. No. 61 at 3.) "
291,2, A rule of reason claim is not pled in the Amended Complaint. 
292,3, NYU does not allege that it raised any objection at this time either. 
294,4, The Court need not reach the non-statutory labor exemption to dismiss NYU's antitrust claim. 
295,5," It is worth noting that there is some tension between some of the Second Circuit case law on this issue. As the Court noted in 
Ciminelli, Tuvia Convalescent Center, Inc. v. National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, 717 F.2d 726 (2d Cir. 
1983), ""broadly held that employers have no standing to sue under ERISA even if they have been directly injured and the 
injuries are within the class of interests that ERISA was intended to protect""; but Dumac Forestry Services, Inc. v. International 
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, 814 F.2d 79 (2d Cir. 1987), and Ciminelli both permitted suits by employers for the return of 
overpayments. See Ciminelli, 976 F.2d at 835 n.1. "

314,1," Ferrellgas does business as ""Blue Rhino."" "
323,1," ""SGI"" refers to the Statement of Genuine Issues filed by Plaintiff. Dkt. No. 22. "
325,2," Defendant also points to Plaintiff's responses to form interrogatories, in which Plaintiff stated that he had not incurred certain 
kinds of damages. Decl. Owen Campbell, ¶ 7, Exs. 6, 7 (Dkt. No. 18). While Plaintiff's responses might provide Defendant useful 
evidence at trial, they do not conclusively establish that Plaintiff suffered no damages. See Bradley v. Allstate Ins. Co., 620 F.3d 
509, 527 n.21 (5th Cir. 2010) (noting that ""interrogatory responses are not binding judicial admissions""). "
327,3," In his opposition to Defendant's summary judgment motion, Plaintiff briefly mentions a duty of a loan service officer ""to review 
Plaintiff for a modification in good faith once a review is undertaken."" Opp'n, at p. 16. Plaintiff neither mentioned this duty in his 
Complaint nor identifies the source of the obligation. "
331,1," Plaintiff alleges that McDonald's Corporation is the franchisor for franchise agreements signed before 2005 and that 
McDonald's USA, LLC is the franchisor for franchise agreements signed from 2005 to the present. "
332,2," Bam-B, plaintiff's former employer, is not a defendant in this action, and plaintiff has not asserted a claim for discrimination. "
336,3," Realistically, only restaurants within the same locale compete for employees. A McDonald's restaurant in Chicago does not 
compete for employees with a McDonald's restaurant in Florida. "
338,4," In their motion, defendants also request that the Court dismiss plaintiff's demand for injunctive relief. Defendants have not 
sufficiently developed this argument, so the request is denied without prejudice. "
351,1," In a competitive market, indirect network effects also encourage companies to take increased profits from a price increase on 
side A and spend them on side B to ensure more robust participation on that side and to stem the impact of indirect network 
effects. See Evans & Schmalensee 688; Evans & Noel 670-671, 695. Indirect network effects thus limit the platform’s ability to 
raise overall prices and impose a check on its market power. See Evans & Schmalensee 688; Evans & Noel 695."
351,2," “Cardholders are more price-sensitive because many consumers have multiple payment methods, including alternative 
payment cards. Most merchants, by contrast, cannot accept just one major card because they are likely to lose profitable 
incremental sales if they do not take [all] the major payment cards. Because most consumers do not carry all of the major 
payment cards, refusing to accept a major card may cost the merchant substantial sales.” Muris 522."
351,3, All figures are accurate as of 2013.
351,4," Discover entered the credit-card market several years after Amex, Visa, and MasterCard. It nonetheless managed to gain a 
foothold because Sears marketed Discover to its already significant base of private-label cardholders. Discover’s business 
model shares certain features with Amex, Visa, and MasterCard. Like Amex, Discover interacts directly with its cardholders. But 
like Visa and MasterCard, Discover uses banks that cooperate with its network to interact with merchants. "
352,5," Plaintiffs also sued Visa and MasterCard, claiming that their anti-steering provisions violated §1. But Visa and MasterCard 
voluntarily revoked their antisteering provisions and are no longer parties to this case. "
353,6," Although the plaintiffs relied on indirect evidence below, they have abandoned that argument in this Court. See Brief for United 
States 23, n. 4 (citing Pet. for Cert. i, 18-25). "
354,7," The plaintiffs argue that we need not define the relevant market in this case because they have offered actual evidence of 
adverse effects on competition—namely, increased merchant fees. See Brief for United States 40-41 (citing FTC v. Indiana 
Federation of Dentists, 476 U. S. 447, 106 S. Ct. 2009, 90 L. Ed. 2d 445 (1986), and Catalano, Inc. v. Target Sales, Inc., 446 U. 
S. 643, 100 S. Ct. 1925, 64 L. Ed. 2d 580 (1980) (per curiam)). We disagree. The cases that the plaintiffs cite for this proposition 
evaluated whether horizontal restraints had an adverse effect on competition. See Indiana Federation of Dentists, supra, at 450-
451, 459, 106 S. Ct. 2009, 90 L. Ed. 2d 445 (agreement between competing dentists not to share X rays with insurance 
companies); Catalano, supra, at 644-645, 650, 100 S. Ct. 1925, 64 L. Ed. 2d 580 (agreement among competing wholesalers not 
to compete on extending credit to retailers). Given that horizontal restraints involve agreements between competitors not to 
compete in some way, this Court concluded that it did not need to precisely define the relevant market to conclude that these 
agreements were anticompetitive. See Indiana Federation of Dentists, supra, at 460-461, 106 S. Ct. 2009, 90 L. Ed. 2d 445; 
Catalano, supra, at 648-649, 100 S. Ct. 1925, 64 L. Ed. 2d 580. But vertical restraints are different. See Arizona v. Maricopa 
County Medical Soc., 457 U. S. 332, 348, n. 18, 102 S. Ct. 2466, 73 L. Ed. 2d 48 (1982); Leegin Creative Leather Products, Inc. 
v. PSKS, Inc., 551 U. S. 877, 888, 127 S. Ct. 2705, 168 L. Ed. 2d 623 (2007). HN7[
] LEdHN[7][
] [7] Vertical restraints often 
pose no risk to competition unless the entity imposing them has market power, which cannot be evaluated unless the Court first 
defines the relevant market. See id., at 898, 127 S. Ct. 2705, 168 L. Ed. 2d 623 (noting that a vertical restraint “may not be a 
serious concern unless the relevant entity has market power”); Easterbrook, Vertical Arrangements and the Rule of Reason, 53 
Antitrust L. J. 135, 160 (1984) (“[T]he possibly anticompetitive manifestations of vertical arrangements can occur only if there is 
market power”). "
355,8," Contrary to the dissent’s assertion, post, at ___ - ___, 201 L. Ed. 2d, at 703, merchant services and cardholder services are not 
complements. See Filistrucchi 297 (“[A] two-sided market [is] different from markets for complementary products, in which both 
products are bought by the same buyers, who, in their buying decisions, can therefore be expected to take into account both 
prices”). As already explained,HN10[
] LEdHN[10][
] [10] credit-card companies are best understood as supplying only one 
product—transactions—which is jointly consumed by a cardholder and a merchant. See Klein 580. Merchant services and 
cardholder services are both inputs to this single product. See ibid."
355,9," Nontransaction platforms, by contrast, often do compete with companies that do not operate on both sides of their platform. A 
newspaper that sells advertising, for example, might have to compete with a television network, even though the two do not 
meaningfully compete for viewers. See Filistrucchi 301. "
358,10," The plaintiffs argue that United States v. Topco Associates, Inc., 405 U. S. 596, 610, 92 S. Ct. 1126, 31 L. Ed. 2d 515 (1972), 
forbids any restraint that would restrict competition in part of the market—here, for example, merchant steering. See Brief for 
Petitioners and Respondents Nebraska, Tennessee, and Texas 30, 42. Topco does not stand for such a broad proposition. 
Topco concluded that a horizontal agreement between competitors was unreasonable per se, even though the agreement did 
not extend to every competitor in the market. See 405 U. S., at 599, 608, 92 S. Ct. 1126, 31 L. Ed. 2d 515. A horizontal 
agreement between competitors is markedly different from a vertical agreement that incidentally affects one particular method of 
competition. See Leegin, 551 U. S., at 888, 127 S. Ct. 2705, 168 L. Ed. 2d 623; Maricopa County Medical Soc., 457 U. S., at 
348, n. 18, 102 S. Ct. 2466, 73 L. Ed. 2d 48. "
374,1," In addition, all Defendants filed a joint motion to stay discovery pending the Court's resolution of the motions to dismiss. (See 
ECF No. 125.) Based on the Court's findings herein, the motion to stay is moot. "
375,2," At times Plaintiffs also appear to refer to the Lafarge entities as ""LaFarge Cement"" and/or ""LaFarge Concrete."" (See ECF No. 
48 ¶¶ 114 and 116.) "
378,3," The inadequacy of Plaintiffs' grouping of Defendants is further highlighted by the fact that Plaintiffs sued both Coastal Concrete 
Company, Inc., and Coastal Southeast II, LLC, nakedly asserting that these two entities ""operate and identify themselves as one 
company,"" when in fact the two companies have no common ownership and are not related. On March 29, 2018, Plaintiffs filed a 
notice voluntarily dismissing Coastal Concrete Company, Inc. from this action. (See ECF No. 109.)"
378,4," This order also has the effect of granting Defendant Elite Concrete of Richmond Hill, LLC's motion (ECF No. 96), wherein Elite 
Concrete of Richmond Hill, LLC joined the arguments raised in the joint Defendants' motion to dismiss (ECF No. 96), but only for 
the reasons set forth in this order."
378,5," The Court also recognizes that Defendants have raised a number of other issues and defenses in their motions to dismiss, and 
the Court may face those questions again; however, because it is not clear whether Plaintiffs will re-file this action, or even 
against which parties Plaintiffs may re-file this action, the Court will reserve its ruling on those questions until an appropriate 
time. "
381,1," In count II of the complaint, the FTC alleged that the settlement between Teva and the other defendants constituted an 
improper restraint of trade in violation of the FTC Act. On May 6, 2015, this court granted the motion of defendants to dismiss 
count II of the complaint, as well as count I to the extent it was premised on the settlement agreements with Teva. As a result, 
Teva was dismissed as a defendant in this action and only the claim involving sham lawsuits in Count I remains. "
382,2," ""A"" and ""B"" are the two general categories into which the FDA sorts drugs when evaluating therapeutic equivalence. Within 
these two categories are various subcategories depending on the type of product (i.e., oral, injectable, solution, or powder) and 
other factors. For our purposes we will focus on ""AB,"" which means ""actual or potential bioequivalence problems have been 
resolved with adequate in vivo and/or in vitro evidence supporting bioequivalence,"" and ""BX,"" which is ""specific drug products for 
which the data that have been reviewed by the Agency are insufficient to determine therapeutic equivalence."" See U.S. Food & 
Drug Admin., Center for Drug Evaluation & Research, Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, at xiii, 
xx (38th ed. 2018), https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/ucm079068.htm#_ftn4 . "
383,3," As stated above, AbbVie acquired all of Abbott's proprietary pharmaceutical business in 2013. Hereafter we will refer to Abbott 
as ""AbbVie."" "
384,4," AbbVie and Besins later amended the license and supply agreements to include AndroGel 1.62%. Royalties on U.S. sales of 
AndroGel 1.62% are paid to LBI SAS or Besins Healthcare Luxembourg SARL (""BHL SARL""). "
386,5," As one witness explained at trial, most patent infringement suits are filed in either the District of Delaware or the District of New 
Jersey because ""they tend to be slow-moving dockets."" "
387,6, Siatis had no involvement in the decision to sue either Teva or Perrigo for patent infringement. 
388,7," During this time AbbVie was negotiating with Teva regarding disputes related to two other drugs, Simcor and TriCor. 
Agreements related to Simcor and TriCor were executed on the same day as the AndroGel settlement. However, there is no 
evidence that these negotiations were linked to the AndroGel settlement."
388,8," Specifically, during a meeting on June 27, 2011, the FDA recommended that Teva withdraw its pump configuration with the 
option to resubmit it as a post-approval amendment once the issue was resolved."
388,9," Perrigo voluntarily dismissed the lawsuit on July 24, 2014, one day after the FDA issued its TE rating to Perrigo. "
389,10," A formulary is a ""listing of medications for which an insurer or managed care organization provides coverage."" See Saltzman 
v. Indep. Blue Cross, 384 F. App'x 107, 109 n.3 (3d Cir. 2010) (citations omitted). Formularies generally divide medications into 
tiers with different copays for each tier. See id. at 109. Typically, the first tier includes generic medications with the lowest copay, 
while higher tiers include brand-name drugs with higher copays. See id. "
390,11," Defendants have moved for reconsideration of that decision. On June 27, 2018, we denied the motion in a separate order 
(Doc. # 438)."
390,12," The Noerr-Pennington doctrine originated from two separate antitrust cases, United Mine Workers of America v. Pennington, 
381 U.S. 657, 85 S. Ct. 1585, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626 (1965) and Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 
365 U.S. 127, 81 S. Ct. 523, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464 (1961). Pennington involved efforts by several companies and a union to lobby the 
Secretary of Labor regarding minimum wage regulations. 381 U.S. at 660. In Noerr, a group of railroads engaged in a publicity 
campaign designed to foster the adoption of certain laws and regulations harmful to the trucking industry. 365 U.S. at 129-30. 
The doctrine has since been extended to persons who petition the courts, in addition to legislatures and administrative agencies. 
See Ca. Motor Transp. Co. v. Trucking Unlimited, 404 U.S. 508, 509-10, 92 S. Ct. 609, 30 L. Ed. 2d 642 (1972). "
393,13," This is commonly known as the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (""PDUFA"") date. Under that Act, the FDA collects a fee 
from companies applying for drug approval and, in exchange, the FDA provides a ""goal date"" by which it will review the 
application. See 21 U.S.C. § 379h. "
394,14," As stated above, Perrigo ultimately agreed to an entry date of January 1, 2015 but this date was moved to December 27, 2014 
pursuant to an acceleration clause in the contract. "
395,15," The FTC has not challenged the general proposition that attorney-client privilege or the attorney work product doctrine applies 
but did engage in motion practice regarding whether certain documents were in fact shielded from discovery by these privileges. 
It also asserted in various pretrial motions and trial briefs that defendants waived these privileges to the extent defendants 
asserted that the in-house counsel who made the decision to sue acted in good faith."
395,16," This is not an unusual situation. It is no different from that faced by courts every day in criminal trials, in which juries are 
instructed to make findings about intent but not to draw a negative inference based on a defendant's failure to testify. See United 
States v. Waller, 654 F.3d 430, 435-38 (3d Cir. 2011). We also note that juries in criminal cases may rely on circumstantial 
evidence to find intent beyond a reasonable doubt, a standard higher than the clear and convincing standard applicable here. 
See id. at 436. "
397,17," Direct evidence of monopoly power is ""rare"" and would require, among other things, evidence that defendants maintained 
abnormally high price-cost margins on AndroGel and that they restricted output. See Mylan Pharms. Inc., 838 F.3d at 434-35 & 
n.53. The FTC has not presented such evidence. "
398,18," Dr. Shapiro explained that he included brand-name AndroGel 1.62% in his analysis because the delay in generic entry caused 
by the sham lawsuits provided defendants with additional time to convert AndroGel 1% sales to AndroGel 1.62%. Dr. Shapiro 
opined that excluding AndroGel 1.62% from the test market could lead to ""artificial and misleading"" results. This is consistent 
with AbbVie's own business projections, which predicted that entry of a generic 1% product would impact AndroGel 1.62% sales."
398,19," Dr. Shapiro defines average weighted price as ""the market price charged by the pharmaceutical companies"" and opines that it 
""is the best way to measure the disparate impact on different customers [i.e., payors, pharmacy benefit managers, and 
pharmacies] because it measures 'the total payments that are involved.'"" "
399,20," Generics generally may forgo certain research and development, marketing, and other costs that a brand-name product must 
incur to launch. See In re Remeron Direct Purchaser Antitrust Litig., 367 F. Supp. 2d 675, 682 (D.N.J. 2005)."
399,21," Furthermore, as Dr. Shapiro himself has recognized, the HMT may also lead to relatively narrow markets that would exclude 
some competing products when gross margins are high, which is the case in the pharmaceutical industry. "
400,22," Natesto, a testosterone nasal spray, was approved by the FDA in 2014 but was not marketed until 2015, after the time period 
at issue here. "
401,23," Defendants exclude oral formulations of testosterone, which are distinguishable in efficacy and potential side effects and are 
generally not recommended within the medical community. "
402,24," While Hynd testified that he changed his view and began to recognize injectables as competition, he did not do so until 2014, 
well after the sham lawsuits were filed and when entry of generic versions of AndroGel was imminent. We do not find credible 
his change of view."
402,25," The TRT market would also include subcutaneous pellets such as Testopel, which constitute a de minimis share of the TRT 
market. There was no evidence presented at trial regarding cross-elasticity of demand between AndroGel and this product. 
Pellets, like injectables, are not part of the relevant market here."
402,26," The medical experts for both sides testified that they have prescribed AndroGel for hypogonadism more than any other 
product. "
404,27, An authorized generic of Vogelxo was also launched at the same time as the brand-name product.
404,28," Defendants cited Barr Laboratories, Inc. v. Abbott Laboratories, 978 F.2d 98 (3d Cir. 1992). This case is inapposite. In that 
private antitrust action, plaintiff claimed attempted monopolization involving oral erythromycin products, which are prescription 
antibiotics. 978 F.2d at 102. Unlike the present action, Barr did not involve a patent. Id. In Barr, there were 32 manufacturers and 
defendant Abbott only held a high of 51.19% of the market in one year. Id. at 103. During the relevant time period the number of 
products competing for sales increased from 111 to 176. Id. Under the circumstances, the Court held that barriers to entry 
remained low and ultimately concluded that no attempted monopolization existed. Id. at 113-14. In contrast, the evidence before 
the court in this pending action demonstrates that the barriers were significant to entry into the TTRT market. "
408,29," As discussed above, the FTC initially took the position that Teva would have entered the market in 2012 with a BX-rated 
generic version of AndroGel 1%. This would freeze AndroGel 1.62%'s share of the AndroGel market at 51%, which is what the 
FTC asserts the share would have been during the last seven months of 2012."
408,30," AndroGel 1.62% has the same active ingredients and effects as AndroGel 1%, but simply requires half the volume of gel. It 
thus has a quicker drying time and therefore less risk of transference. "
411,31," The FTC has advised the court that since the filing of the lawsuits against Teva and Perrigo in 2011, defendants have filed 
numerous other patent infringement suits against competitors, including seven lawsuits related to the '894 patent. The FTC has 
presented no evidence that these lawsuits were shams, and therefore they do not provide support for the injunctive relief sought 
here. "
414,1," The court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1332. McGarry is a partnership whose members are all citizens of Illinois. BMS 
shows a good faith basis that the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000."
414,2, The court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1332. Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b).
414,3," Unless otherwise noted, the following facts are taken from plaintiff's complaint and are presumed true for the purpose of 
resolving the pending motion. Active Disposal, Inc. v. City of Darien, 635 F.3d 883, 886 (7th Cir. 2011) (citation omitted)."
414,4, The court infers that the interest paid to an estate was less than what would be paid to a normal commercial client.
414,5, The complaint includes additional allegations that are not pertinent to the disposition of the motion. 
415,6," The language under the federal antitrust statutes regarding who is able to maintain an antitrust claim is substantially similar to 
that of the IAA. Compare 15 U.S.C. § 15 (""any person who shall be injured in his business by reason of anything forbidden in the 
antitrust laws . . . .) with 740 ILCS 10/7 (""Any person who has been injured in his business or property, or is threatened with such 
injury, by violation of Section 3 of this Act . . . .)."
415,7," BMS argues that McGarry should be collaterally estopped from arguing that it has standing to bring a state antitrust claim 
because the court previously found that McGarry lacked standing to bring a federal antitrust claim. In the prior case, McGarry 
conceded that it was not a purchaser of any kind; therefore, it had not participated in any market. 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 93133, 
2017 WL 2619143 at *3. The issue of whether McGarry had standing under the IAA was not decided. While Illinois courts look to 
federal law to guide their interpretation of the IAA, they are not bound by the decisions of federal courts. See Gilbert's Ethan 
Allen Gallery v. Ethan Allen, Inc., 162 Ill. 2d 99, 103, 642 N.E.2d 470, 472, 204 Ill. Dec. 769 (1994) (stating that federal case law 
""is merely a guide to use in interpreting"" the IAA and that federal decisions are not binding on Illinois courts). Accordingly, 
McGarry is not estopped from arguing that it has standing to bring a state antitrust claim."
415,8," While there are narrow exceptions to this rule, McGarry did not convince the court that it fit within them. "
416,9," McGarry's motion to reopen the bankruptcy case and for derivative standing to assert antitrust claims was denied, in part 
because the trustee's refusal to reopen the estate was justified. See Order at 5, In re Integrated Genomics, Inc., 11 B 19086, 
2017 Bankr. LEXIS 4596 (Bankr. N.D. Ill. Nov. 21, 2017). "
430,1," The Court reads the allegations and assertions of the pleadings and supporting affidavits in the light most favorable to Plaintiff. 
Combs v. Bakker, 886 F.2d 673, 676 (4th Cir. 1989). "
431,2," While Plaintiffs' claim must meet the elements of a restraint on trade under 15 U.S.C. § 1 as described above, their cause of 
action as a private party is derived from 15 U.S.C. § 15. "
459,1," Yet the exhibits ABG attaches to its complaint contradict this assertion. ABG includes screenshots of multiple Amazon retailers 
selling LOMA products. (See R. 13-3, 13-4.) "
460,2," ABG has standing in the traditional sense. See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61, 112 S. Ct. 2130, 119 L. 
Ed. 2d 351 (1992). ABG was injured when Amazon twice shuttered its store; LOMA and Hanen ostensibly caused the injury by 
complaining to Amazon; and ABG's plea for monetary damages would redress the lost profits flowing from the injury. "
462,3," On the same facts, ABG's amended complaint alleges a violation of the Michigan Antitrust Reform Act. (R. 13, PageID.167.) As 
Michigan's antitrust law runs parallel to the Sherman Act, ABG's failure to plead antitrust injury applies to the state claim as 
well. See Manitou N. Am. v. McCormick Int'l, No. 324063, 2016 Mich. App. LEXIS 198, at *14-17 (Mich. Ct. App. Feb. 2, 2016)."
462,4," Though the parties do not cite it, the Court is aware that a later Michigan Court of Appeals decision appears to suggest 
otherwise. See International Bhd. of Elec. Workers, Local Union No. 58 v. McNulty, 214 Mich. App. 437, 543 N.W.2d 25, 30 
(Mich. Ct. App. 1995) (""An allegation of fraud based on misrepresentations made to a third party does not constitute a valid fraud 
claim.""). Read in context, however, McNulty involves a fraud claim lacking an allegation of reliance. See McNulty, 543 N.W.2d at "
463,30," (""The union has not claimed that it acted in reliance on defendants' allegedly false statements.""). So whatever McNulty may 
say about fraud claims based on statements made to third-parties, the case is distinguishable from this one. ABG alleges it 
relied on LOMA's statements to Amazon. "
469,1," Citations to ""J.A."" refer to the parties' Deferred Joint Appendix. Citations to ""C.A."" refer to the parties' Deferred Confidential 
Joint Appendix, which has been filed under seal. "
473,2," Anderson's initial complaint also included TNG and Hudson as defendants. Anderson voluntarily dismissed its claims against 
TNG within days of filing the complaint. Over four years later, in December 2013, it settled its claims against Hudson and 
voluntarily dismissed its claims against that defendant. "
476,3," We note further that our observation in requiring that Anderson be allowed to amend its complaint was not determinative of the 
conspiracy's ultimate ""plausibility,"" because ""[a]t the pleading stage . . . the complaint need not offer a plausible reason for the 
defendants' conspiracy but 'merely needs to allege that they did indeed conspire and give some factual allegations that would 
support such a claim.'"" Areeda & Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law, ¶ 308, at 174 n.101. "
480,4," Anderson asserts that the district court erred in observing that ""Anderson cannot say when the alleged conspiracy started."" See 
Appellants' Br. 47-48 n.12 (quoting Anderson News III, 123 F. Supp. at 486) (""[T]he evidence indicates the defendants reached 
agreement by January 15—the day that Parker reported that 'no one will ag[r]ee' to Anderson's proposal.""); see also Appellants' 
Reply Br. 46 (the ""jury could conclude that the conspiracy was fully formed by January 15""). But Anderson shifts away from the 
January 15 date when it is convenient—for example, it argues that Time/TWR and Kable did not make their final decisions until 
February 1, id. at 38, 39, and that Bauer did not make its final decision until January 31, id. at 44-45. These inconsistencies 
highlight the fundamental ambiguity of the record before us. Since February 1 was Anderson's threatened shipment cutoff date, 
the fact that defendants tended to make their decisions around that date just as likely reflected a legitimate reaction to 
Anderson's Program as it was evidence of collusive behavior. "
487,5," Anderson argued before the District Court that its tortious interference with contract claim could be ""predicated on a plaintiff's 
breach of its contract with a third-party where, as here, the defendants' actions prevented the contract from being performed."" 
J.A. 1596 (internal citations omitted). Anderson also argued that it had grounds for a tortious interference with business relations 
claim in defendants' disparaging comments to retailers, which, it argues, persuaded retailers to terminate their relationships with 
Anderson. Anderson has abandoned these claims on appeal and we do not address them further. "
488,6," The counterclaim-plaintiffs correctly note that the District Court held that they lacked antitrust standing for another reason, too: 
it concluded that the counterclaim-plaintiffs would have suffered the same injuries even if Anderson had been acting alone. This 
basis for summary judgment was not, they argue, raised before the District Court by the parties and, therefore, could not 
permissibly serve as the basis for granting summary judgment since the counterclaim-plaintiffs had no notice of the ground and 
no opportunity to respond. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f). Because we agree with the District Court that the counterclaim-plaintiffs' injuries 
do not flow from that which makes Anderson's alleged acts unlawful, we need not address this argument. "
491,1, ZPE incorrectly numbered counterclaims six through 11 as four through nine; the correct numbers are indicated here.
491,2," Because ZPE references Avocent's original complaint, FAC, and the complaint in the Alabama Action, some of those factual 
allegations are included in this background. Only factual allegations relevant to ZPE's amended counterclaims are included here. 
For a more thorough recitation of the background, see the Order Denying Motion for Preliminary Injunction and Denying Motions 
to Dismiss (Dkt. No. 82). "
492,3," Zimmerman and Ceci have worked together for ""decades, starting long before [their] work[] at Avocent."" Zimmerman Decl. ¶ 3. "
496,4," Avocent acknowledges that I need not consider the Brillhart factors under my discretionary authority to hear these declaratory 
relief claims, but argues that I should nonetheless allow them to guide my analysis. Mot. at 5 (citing Brillhart v. Excess Ins. Co. of 
America, 316 U.S. 491, 495, 62 S. Ct. 1173, 86 L. Ed. 1620 (1942); Reply at 2 (""[T]his Court has discretion to consider whether 
to dismiss these counterclaims, D.I. 120 at 4-5, and may do so with or without applying the Brillhart factors[.]""). The Ninth Circuit 
has sanctioned consideration of the Brillhart factors, even when a case has been removed and there is no pending state court 
action. Huth v. Hartford Ins. Co. of the Midwest, 298 F.3d 800, 803 (9th Cir. 2002). The Brillhart factors dictate that a ""district 
court should avoid needless determination of state law issues; it should discourage litigants from filing declaratory actions as a 
means of forum shopping; and it should avoid duplicative litigation."" Huth, 298 F.3d at 803. "
497,," Here, the first factor may slightly favor Avocent, since its Alabama complaint asserts claims under Alabama state law. I note, 
however, that ZPE disputes the choice of law, which Avocent presents as a settled issue. It may be that Alabama law does not 
apply after all. The second factor clearly favors ZPE—it filed counterclaims here, in the first filed action, after Avocent sued it for 
patent infringement. It cannot be accused of forum shopping. And, at this point, the third factor favors Avocent since its Alabama 
complaint asserts these affirmative claims. But ZPE underscores the pending motion to dismiss that complaint for lack of 
personal jurisdiction, and indicates that it plans to file a motion to transfer that action to this venue, if its motion to dismiss is 
denied. Given the potential that these actions may still be consolidated here, there is no guarantee of duplicative litigation. In 
short, the Brillhart factors do not add much value to the analysis. "
498,5," ZPE mentions the named inventors who ""remained Avocent employees through at least the issuance of the '682 Patent on 
December 10, 2010[,]"" ACC ¶ 59, and specifically focuses on purported inventor Graham Holt, who it alleges was aware of and 
concealed material prior art, id. ¶¶ 62, 65-66, 73-75, 79. But it does not appear to argue Holt's deceptive intent in its opposition 
to Avocent's motion. See Opp'n at 10; Reply at 4 n.4 (noting that ZPE ""identifie[d] only Mr. Davidson as the alleged 'who'... .""). "
499,6," ZPE also alleges that Davidson responded to an Office Action rejecting claims in view of U.S. Patent No. 6,526,442 (""Stupek"") 
representing that ""[t]he key difference between Stupek and the claimed invention lies in the vital distinction between an in-band 
management system and an out-of-band-management system. . . . Stupek does not . . . claim to be an out-of-band management 
tool."" Am. Counterclaims ¶ 122 (quoting October 9, 2007 Response to Office Action). ZPE argues that Davidson had a duty to 
disclose prior art ""known to them to show managed devices that were implemented in out-of-band networks that were 
implemented in out-of-band networks... ."" Id.; see Opp'n at 13 (arguing that a prosecuting attorney's failure to identify prior art 
that contradicts his assertion provides a distinct grounds for inequitable conduct under 37 C.F.R. 1.56(b)). "
503,7," The Federal Circuit ""applies the law of the regional circuit as to market definition."" TransWeb, 812 F.3d at 1307. "
506,8," The other elements are plausibly pleaded—ZPE identifies third parties as prospective customers, Avocent's knowledge of 
those relationships, and an independently wrongful act in the form of Avocent's attempted enforcement of patents it knew were 
invalid and procured through fraud. "
510,1, The Second Amended Complaint contains two Count III's. This count and all subsequent counts are renumbered for clarity. 
522,2," Plaintiffs attach as an Exhibit to their Oppositions an April 2016 letter from the law firm representing the Rouse Defendants. 
(See, e.g., Doc. 164-1). The letter states that Rouse's follows a ""justifiable policy to locate only in shopping centers where it will 
not be at risk of baseless allegations from competing businesses."" (Id.). The Court declines to consider this letter, which was not 
referenced in or attached to the Second Amended Complaint. In any event, the letter does not suggest that Rouse's made 
statements concerning this ""policy"" to any Developer Defendants during the events underlying this lawsuit. Plaintiffs also 
attempted to file a sur-reply arguing, in part, that all of their claims were ""filed timely"" and the Rouse Defendants failed to 
""mention or disprove . . . how these claims are continuing torts and have not prescribed."" (Doc. 174-1 at 1). The Court denied 
leave to file a sur-reply, (Doc. 176), but it notes that the proposed sur-reply argued that the alleged torts were continuing ""as you 
can purchase a burrito from Rouse's,"" which does not establish that individual instances of alleged defamation or disparagement 
constitute a continuing tort. See, e.g., Scott v. Zaheri, 2014-0726 (La. App. 4 Cir. 12/3/14), 157 So. 3d 779, 787 (publication of 
four anonymous letters constituted four ""separate and distinct acts"" of defamation, with particular damages flowing from each 
act, and did not ""rise to the level of a continuing tort"")."
522,3," Plaintiffs' Opposition characterizes this claim as ""Tortious Interference With a Contract."" (Doc. 164 at 5). The Second Amended 
Complaint, however, describes how the Rouse Defendants ""tortiously interfered and continue to tortiously interfere with lawful 
business relations."" (Doc. 138 at 8). "
523,4," The Court reiterates that, as discussed supra, a lease containing a restrictive covenant is not inherently tortious. "
529,1," At the hearing, Plaintiff's counsel raised a refusal to deal as a new basis for certain claims. Defendants sought leave to brief 
this issue if it would be considered in connection with the present motions. Because this new theory has not been briefed by the 
parties, it is not addressed in this Order."
529,2, The FAC Order dismissed the Clayton Act Section 3 claim with prejudice. FAC Order at 22-23. 
535,3," The TAC also alleges that, as early as 2013, OSI and ETAP agreed ""to maintain and enhance their individual and collective 
monopoly positions in the NUPIC Market[s] by and through an exclusive arrangement whereby they would sell their products in 
conjunction with each other in order to foreclose competitors from challenging their market power and to maintain and increase 
their monopoly positions."" Id. ¶ 80. "
546,4," Eaton is an exception in this regard. Thus, the TAC alleges that Eaton ""has its own captive suite"" of Grid D and M Products. Id. 
¶ 152. No similar allegations are made with respect to the remaining alleged competitors in the EMS Platform Market — 
Siemens, GE, ABB, Honeywell and the other ""additional smaller competitors."" Id. "
557,1," Plaintiffs have, however, for the first time on this motion, see DE 75 at 16-17, made a ""request for further discovery on the 
question of personal jurisdiction."" In re Magnetic Audiotape Antitrust Litig., 334 F.3d at 206. Having done so, limited discovery on 
this issue would be permitted to proceed, provided plaintiffs' action should survive the balance of the motion. Id. As set forth 
below, it should not. "
575,1," For instance Nat'l Rifle Ass'n involved the pre-enforcement challenge to the constitutionality of Title XI of the Violent Crime 
Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, Pub.L. No. 103-22, 108 Stat. 1796 (1994) (the ""Crime Control Act""). Nat'l Rifle 
Ass'n, 132 F.3d at 272. The Crime Control Act prohibited for a period of ten years the manufacture, transfer, or possession of 
semi-automatic weapons and the transfer or possession of large capacity ammunition feeding devices. Id. at 277. One group of 
Plaintiffs, manufacturers and dealers of firearms, alleged that the passage of the Crime Control Act had a significant impact on 
the way they conducted their businesses and that compliance with the legislation caused them immediate economic harm. The 
Sixth Circuit concluded that the declaratory judgment act provided a procedural mechanism for these Plaintiffs to bring their 
claim because ""the federal court is not asked to decide a case involving conjectural or hypothetical injury, but one that creates 
substantial economic hardship, which is direct and immediate, and will be compounded by a refusal of the court to intervene 
prior to enforcement of the statute."" Nat'l Rifle Ass'n, 132 F.3d at 287. "
578,2," The Court notes that since MedImmune, a declaratory judgment plaintiff is not required to show that a defendant threatened 
litigation to establish an actual controversy under the Act. However, proof of such a threat is nevertheless evidence that weighs 
in favor of proving the existence of an actual controversy under the governing test, which asks whether the facts alleged, under 
all the circumstances, show that there is a substantial controversy, between parties having adverse legal interests, of sufficient 
immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment. See MedImmune, 549 U.S. at 127. "
580,3," Notably, the Ordinance itself contains enforcement provisions that allow the County to issue ""appearance ticket[s]"" as well as 
civil and criminal penalties. See Dkt. 1 Ex. H, § 4.5.2-4.5.3. While both parties recognize that STAT has and continues to provide 
emergency services in the County in violation of the Ordinance, no evidence suggests that the County or the County's agents 
have taken steps to enforce the Ordinance according to its terms. At the hearing on Defendant's motion to dismiss, counsel for 
Plaintiff acknowledged that the only ""enforcement action"" purportedly undertaken by Plaintiff involved the sending of a letter on 
January 18, 2017 to Defendant indicating that ""STAT cannot continue to . . . violate the Ordinance and provide either intra-
county transport or EMS ambulance services within Saginaw County in defiance of the Ordinance . . . ."" See Dkt. 1 Ex. 1, Pg. ID 
119."
580,4," Plaintiff has made several arguments, statements, and references throughout this litigation to this effect. See, e.g., Dkt. 17, Pg. 
ID 485 (""It is obvious that STAT is simply hoping to clear this case out of the way and initiate its own Sherman Antitrust and 14th 
Amendment due process claims against the County with a preferred judge."")."
580,5," The Court notes that the parties' meet-and-confer emails show that the parties appear to have a definite and concrete 
controversy surrounding whether the Ordinance is authorized under Michigan law. Counsel for STAT states that ""[t]he 
ambulance ordinance, as currently written, requires STAT to be 'licensed' by a body which has no authority to license,"" and 
expressed an opinion that ""there is no way that the [Ordinance] is authorized or enforceable."" Dkt. 17-1, Pg. ID 496. This issue 
presents purely questions of Michigan law, however, the answers of which may very well render superfluous the hypothetical 
antitrust issues that currently dwell on the fringes of obscurity between the parties. "
581,6," As noted above, the posture of Plaintiff's case in this action is vastly different from plaintiffs in declaratory judgment cases 
presenting ripe, actual controversies. Nat'l Rifle Ass'n and MedImmune are instructive. In Nat'l Rifle Ass'n, a set of plaintiffs 
alleged that the passage of a statute had a significant impact on the way they conducted their businesses and indicated that 
their compliance with the statute caused them immediate harm. Nat'l Rifle Ass'n, 132 F.3d at 281. Similarly, MedImmune 
considered a plaintiff that sought relief under the Act based on its desire to stop making royalty payments pursuant to a licensing 
agreement. MedImmune, 549 U.S. at 121. The plaintiff faced two choices: 1) continue to make the payments, even though 
plaintiff believed it had the right to stop making the payments, or 2) stop making the payments and face imminent civil litigation. 
Id. at 122. In MedImmune, the risk of a civil suit was certain and imminent because the Defendant expressed its intent to sue the 
plaintiff for violating the agreement if it stopped making the royalty payments. Id. "
586,1," The Court deems this matter appropriate for decision without oral argument. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 78; Local Rule 7-15. The 
hearing set for July 30, 2018 is removed from the Court's calendar."
586,2," The parties refer to Plaintiff simply as ""Ozzy."" The Court will do so as well."
586,3," The Court notes that for more than a month one of AEG's lawyers has been listed on filings with the note ""pro hac vice to be 
filed."" Counsel should either file a pro hac vice application immediately or not be listed on filings. "
587,4," Ozzy alleges that a requirement to play one show at the Staples Center is akin to requiring all shows to be played there due to 
high switching costs that typically make splitting dates among venues in the same city impractical. FAC ¶ 34."
587,5, The last two factors are irrelevant because Ozzy does not seek monetary damages. 
588,6," ""For a tying claim to suffer per se condemnation, a plaintiff must prove: (1) that the defendant tied together the sale of two 
distinct products or services; (2) that the defendant possesses enough economic power in the tying product market to coerce its 
customers into purchasing the tied product; and (3) that the tying arrangement affects a 'not insubstantial volume of commerce' 
in the tied product market."" Cascade Health Sols. v. PeaceHealth, 515 F.3d 883, 913 (9th Cir. 2008). "
591,1," The Court notes that the parties have assiduously avoided the question of whether dual-frequency transmitters are a potential 
solution to this dispute. When the Court specifically posed this question to Alarm Detection's counsel during his opening 
statement, the answer was long but non-responsive. See R. 471 at 30-32 (30:8-32:24). During trial there was testimony that 
some big-box stores utilize dual-frequency transmitters, see R. 474 at 134 (988:11-21), but the issue was not addressed in post-
trial briefing. The Court's order requesting supplemental briefing highlighted this testimony and explained how the Court believed 
the apparent unavailability of dual-frequency transmitters affected the Court's understanding of the factual circumstances of the 
case. See R. 499 at 2. Only Orland FPD's supplemental brief noted its agreement that such technology is not available or 
economically feasible. See R. 501 at 6. Alarm Detection and Tyco did not address the issue. See R. 500; R. 502. The Court 
concludes from this agreement/silence that dual-frequency transmitters are generally unavailable due to some combination of 
technological and economic circumstances."
591,2," This testimony from Orland witnesses is sufficient to prove their motivations. There was insufficient evidence presented at trial 
for the Court to determine the relative merits of the two systems, but such a finding is unnecessary for the Court to render a 
verdict in this case."
591,3," The Lisle-Woodridge case was remanded for various reasons, including potential consideration of any antitrust violations, but 
the case settled after court decisions based on Illinois law. Although Alarm Detection has consistently argued that the Lisle-
Woodridge decisions require a finding in its favor, the Seventh Circuit did not engage in an analysis of anticompetitive effect or 
address any of the legal doctrines on which this Court's verdict is based. "
597,4," The Court ordered supplemental briefing to address the Fisher line of cases as the parties had not addressed it in their trial 
briefs. "
603,5," It has taken too long to reach a final judgment in this case. The case would have benefited from clearer thinking earlier in the 
proceedings about what facts, case law, and legal doctrine would ultimately prove to be dispositive—most notably the Fisher line 
of cases which the parties never addressed until ordered to do so in supplemental post-trial briefing. "
624,1," For the purposes of calculating damages under this scenario, Dr. Lamb relies on an analysis conducted by Professor Einer 
Elhauge in which he determines that a payment-free settlement would have provided for an entry date of November 2, 2012. Dr. 
Lamb alternatively assumes a June 2012 generic entry date based on George Johnston's alternative theory that absent a 
settlement agreement, Mylan would have prevailed in the patent litigation brought against it, resulting in generic entry by it in 
June 2012, and by other generic competitors under the terms of their agreements with Forest. "
627,2," Defendants ask the Court to strike Dr. Berndt's Amended Reply Report as an improper sur-rebuttal based on Dr. Berndt's 
treatment of issues and documents raised during his deposition about his initial report. The Court will do no such thing. See 
Cedar Petrochemicals, Inc. v. Dongbu Hannong Chem, Co., 769 F. Supp. 2d 269, 277 - 79 (S.D.N.Y. 2011). Defendants are not 
unduly prejudiced by Dr. Berndt's review and informed response to their challenges raised at deposition. "

635,4," The Merz Entities were originally named defendants to some of the counts in, the amended complaint. On April 20, 2017, the 
parties entered a stipulation naming Forest Laboratories, Inc. and Forest Laboratories Holdings Ltd. as defendants to Counts III, 
IV, and V, and dismissing the Merz Entities as defendants (See Did. No. 207.)"
635,5," On December 28, 2015, RDC filed an identical complaint against Forest and Merz. All parties stipulated to consolidation of the 
two duplicative actions, with the Smith Complaint serving as the operative complaint in the consolidated action (see Dkt. No. 12, 
Case No. 15 Civ. 10083), and an amended caption to reflect consolidation: In Re Namenda Direct Purchaser Antirust Litigation. 
(See Dkt. No. 22, Case No. 15 Civ. 10083.) "
642,6," Because Plaintiffs have raised genuine issues of material fact regarding whether the Lexapro Amendment constituted an 
unlawful reverse payment, they have likewise raised genuine issues of material fact as to whether the deal, taken as a whole, 
constituted an unlawful reverse payment. The Court need not discuss each component. All claims related to Forest's settlement 
agreements with Mylan will go to trial. "

] An appeal may be taken as a matter of right from an interlocutory order or judgment relating to an antitrust claim. See La. R.S. 51:134  and 51:135. Furthermore, in the case of a restricted appeal, such as this, an appellant may also challenge 
interlocutory rulings involving the same or related issues. Roba, Inc. v. Courtney, 2009-0509 (La. App. 1 Cir. 8/10/10), 47 So.3d

relating to the antitrust claims are integral to the issues relating to the LUTPA claims. As such, the issues relating to the LUTPA 
claims are properly before us in this restricted appeal of a judgment relating to the antitrust claims. "
673,1," For a detailed discussion of the history of federal antitrust law and its interplay with state antitrust law see Olstad. The 
Olstad court also recognized that while states can regulate interstate commerce in some circumstances, ""[s]tate law is

Kalinowski, Antitrust Laws & Trade Regulation § 100.03 (2d ed.2004)). "
676,1," The allegations are taken from the Complaint and assumed to be true for purposes of this motion. Faber v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 
648 F.3d 98, 104 (2d Cir. 2011)."
676,2," According to the Complaint, reducing the incidence of DVT and PE cases has been a priority for national health authorities in 
recent years. (See id. ¶¶ 40-44). "
677,3," The Complaint states that in January 2015 Bard announced its plan to launch ""coated PICCs"" but that Bard later dropped ""any 
further reference to its efforts to develop a thrombo-resistant PICC family of products."" (Id. ¶¶ 59, 61). Further, ""thrombo-
resistant coating"" is allegedly inferior to AngioDynamics' integrated Endexo Technology in terms of ""reduced thrombus results"" 
and ""protecting cut surfaces""; AngioDynamics also asserts that coatings ""elute into the blood stream, exposing patients to 
chemicals unnecessarily."" (Id. ¶¶ 59, 60). "
678,4," Bard notes in their motion that ""Bard originally obtained FDA approval to sell its stylets preloaded in its PICCs and applied for 
FDA approval to sell the stylets separately only in response [*10]  to, and in order to accommodate, Cleveland Clinic's request."" 
(Dkt. No. 14-1, at 16 n.6). Bard also states that ""Cleveland Clinic ultimately switched to purchasing [the stylets] together with 
PICCs as an integrated product."" (Id. at 16 n.5). These factual assertions, however, are outside the pleadings and thus not 
properly considered on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion. See Nakahata v. New York-Presbyterian Healthcare Sys., 723 F.3d 192, 202 (2d 
Cir. 2013)."
678,5," In their moving papers, Bard asserts that another seller of tip location systems, Teleflex, preloads its stylets in its PICCs. (Dkt. 
No. 14-1, at 10 n.2; see also Dkt. Nos. 14-2, 14-3). AngioDynamics responds that Teleflex also sells its stylets separately. (Dkt. 
No. 18, at 19 & n.5). The Court has not considered either party's factual assertions on this issue because they are outside of the 
pleadings. (See supra note 4). As AngioDynamics correctly notes, on a motion to dismiss, the Court cannot consider the 
contents of documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the truth asserted therein; instead, the Court must 
confine itself to the four corners of the Complaint. See Staehr v. Hartford Fin. Serv. Grp., 547 F.3d 406, 425 (2d Cir. 2008). "
680,6," Citing Kaufman and E&L Consulting, Bard argues that ""pleading anticompetitive effects is a requirement even when a plaintiff 
purports to allege a per se tying claim."" (Dkt. No. 14-1, at 17 & n.8). AngioDynamics demurs, noting that the court in these two 
cases did ""not state whether it [was] analyzing a per se or Rule of Reason claim."" (Dkt. No. 18, at 21 n.6). Further, as 
AngioDynamics points out, (id. at 20-21), the Second Circuit in Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Visa U.S.A. Inc. (In re Visa 
Check/MasterMoney Antitrust Litigation) did not include a required showing of anticompetitive effects when listing out the four 
""substantive elements of [an] illegal per se tying claim,"" as opposed to ""tying claims under a rule of reason theory,"" which require 
proof that ""the challenged action had an adverse effect on competition as a whole in the relevant market and, if the defendant 
shows a pro-competitive redeeming virtue of the action, that the same pro-competitive effect could be achieved though [sic] an 
alternative means that is less restrictive of competition."" 280 F.3d 124, 134 n.5 (2d Cir. 2001), overruled on other grounds by 
Miles v. Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. (In re Initial Pub. Offerings Sec. Litig.), 471 F.3d 24 (2d Cir. 2006), and superseded by statute 
on other grounds as stated in Attenborough v. Constr. & Gen. Bldg. Laborers' Local 79, 238 F.R.D. 82, 100 (S.D.N.Y. 2006). 
Here, AngioDynamics advances a single tying claim under both per se and rule-of-reason theories. Since Bard moves to dismiss 
the Complaint for failure to allege anticompetitive effects, the Court must review the anticompetitive effects allegations to 
determine, at the very least, whether AngioDynamics has stated a rule-of-reason tying claim. "
683,7," As AngioDynamics correctly points out, (see Dkt. No. 18, at 24), the cases cited by Bard are distinguishable, involving 
conclusory allegations of anticompetitive effects, in sharp contrast to the details alleged here. "

693,*," The Honorable Robert S. Lasnik, Senior District Judge for the Western District of Washington, sitting by designation."
693,1," To protect against the risk that the price of natural gas will increase before the delivery date, many sophisticated gas 
purchasers seek to ""hedge"" by purchasing natural gas futures contracts—standardized contracts for the sale and purchase of 
natural gas at a specific price in the future—which are resolved financially (i.e., by selling the contractual interest for cash or "
694,," otherwise liquidating the gas interest) rather than by taking delivery of gas. A properly executed hedging strategy negates any 
loss or gain on the physical purchase due to changes in the price of gas, as the physical gas customer stands in the position of a 
natural gas seller for purposes of the futures contract. Ideally, the ""buy"" position on the physical contract and the ""sell"" position 
on the futures contract counterbalance each other so that the physical gas purchaser is left with a net cost for natural gas equal 
to the price of natural gas at the time it entered the physical gas contract."
694,2," A ""wash trade"" is ""a prearranged pair of trades of the same good between the same parties, involving no economic risk and no 
net change in beneficial ownership. These trades expose the parties to no monetary risk and serve no legitimate business 
purpose."" Such trades were alleged to have ""exaggerated market demand for natural gas and thus manipulate[d] natural gas 
prices."""
694,3," ""Churning"" is ""a pattern of natural gas purchases and sales"" wherein (a) the gas marketing companies ""both bought and sold 
during the trading interval, so that the trades largely offset each other,"" (b) ""gross trading volume greatly exceeded net trading 
volume,"" and (c) the companies ""made a relatively large number of consecutive purchases and/or sales in a short amount of 
time, often being the only buyer and/or seller during the burst of transactions."" ""Churning"" allegedly enabled the companies to 
""artificially manipulate the day's average price by initially buying (which raised the prices), and then selling (which brought prices 
back down)."""
694,4," Like the parties' briefs, we refer to CenterPoint Energy Services by its current name. However, CES was known as Retail 
Energy Retail, Inc. during the Class Period. "
695,5," From January 1, 2000, to August 31, 2002, CES was a wholly owned subsidiary of Reliant Energy Resources Corp., which, in 
turn, was a wholly owned subsidiary of Old Reliant."
695,6," During the Class Period, Old Reliant was in the process of restructuring its business pursuant to a plan filed with the Texas 
Public Utility Commission as required by Texas law. From January 1, 2000, to January 1, 2001 (the first year of the Class 
Period), CES and RES were both wholly owned subsidiaries of RERC, which was itself wholly owned by Old Reliant. The first 
phase of the restructuring was completed on January 1, 2001 (one year into the Class Period). After January 1, 2001, Old 
Reliant owned 83% of RES (through a new company, Reliant Resources Inc.), while CES remained wholly owned (through 
RERC). Reliant completed the restructuring one month before the end of the Class Period. As of September 30, 2002, the 
restructuring of Old Reliant resulted in two independent, publicly traded companies: Reliant Resources, Inc. (""New Reliant""), 
which owned RES, and CenterPoint Energy, Inc., which owned CES. "
697,7," For purposes of summary judgment, CES does not contest the substance of the evidence that Reliant successfully conspired 
with the other (non-Reliant) defendants and co-conspirators to manipulate retail gas prices."
697,8," Lenox dealt with a claim under Section 2 of the Sherman Act. 847 F.3d at 1229. Section 2 provides that ""[e]very person who 
shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of 
the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a felony."" 15 U.S.C. § 2. "
698,," However, the Tenth Circuit panel based its holding on Copperweld, a Section 1 case, which it held to apply equally to Section 2 
cases. Id. at 1234. "
699,9," This distinction provides a bright-line limit on an antitrust plaintiff's recovery from a particular defendant. While a ""veil-piercing, 
alter ego, or respondeat superior theory"" might render a defendant separately and individually liable for any conduct of its 
corporate affiliates, Plaintiffs' theory seeks to hold CES liable only for its own alleged anticompetitive acts. See Lenox, 847 F.3d 
at 1237. Therefore, any recovery from an affiliate under Plaintiffs' Copperweld corollary would be limited to damages caused by 
anticompetitive conduct attributable to that affiliate."
699,10," The cases cited by CES merely apply this distinction, and thus they are not contrary to Plaintiffs' ""single entity"" theory. See In 
re Ins. Brokerage Antitrust Litig., 618 F.3d 300, 341 n.44 (3d Cir. 2010) (noting the defendant subsidiaries were not alleged to 
have actually participated in the alleged bid-rigging scheme); Mitchael v. Intracorp, Inc., 179 F.3d 847, 857 (10th Cir. 1999) 
(rejecting ""single enterprise"" theory ""[i]n the absence of any specific evidence of coordinated activity"" and distinguished on this 
basis in Lenox, 847 F.3d at 1234); Acuity Optical Labs., LLC v. Davis Vision, Inc., No. 14-cv-03231, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
112423, 2016 WL 4467883, at *9 (C.D. Ill. Aug. 23, 2016) (finding no ""actual evidence"" of ""coordinated activity""); Vollrath Co. v. 
Sammi Corp., No. CV 85-820 MRP, 1989 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16902, 1989 WL 201632, at *20-21 (C.D. Cal. Dec. 20, 1989) (finding 
no evidence of an inter-enterprise conspiracy and thus no actionable conspiracy under Copperweld); cf. Am. Needle, Inc. v. Nat'l 
Football League, 560 U.S. 183, 195-96, 130 S. Ct. 2201, 176 L. Ed. 2d 947 (2010) (holding that separately owned NFL teams 
were not a ""single entity"" under Copperweld). Cases addressing veil-piercing, alter-ego, and respondeat-superior theories are 
likewise inapposite. "
700,11," Again, for purposes of summary judgment, CES does not contest the substance of Plaintiffs' evidence that one or more Reliant 
companies successfully conspired with non-Reliant defendants and co-conspirators to manipulate the prices of gas sold by CES 
during the Class Period. See FERC Final Report at ES-5 (describing churning by Reliant in 2000 and 2001)."
700,12," The parties dispute how much gas CES sold in Wisconsin, how much money CES received for that gas, and  [**25] how much 
of that gas came from RES. These are issues for the trier of fact. "
703,**," This summary constitutes no part of the opinion of the court. It has been prepared by court staff for the convenience of the 
reader. "
704,*," Judge Kim McLane Wardlaw was drawn to replace Judge Marvin Garbis, who retired after oral argument but before this opinion 
was published. Judge Wardlaw has read the briefs, reviewed the record, and listened to oral argument. "
708,1," Because we conclude that the Olympic Committee and USATF should be afforded implied antitrust immunity, we do not reach 
the alternative argument raised by the Olympic Committee and USATF that Run Gum failed to sufficiently allege the requisite 
relevant market for antitrust injury. "
709,1," The only entities alleged to profit from the exception are the apparel manufacturers, who compete for advertising space on 
athletes' apparel with fewer potential rivals, thus suppressing their advertising costs. While it is possible that defendants 
indirectly profit from the exception by conspiring with the apparel manufacturers, Run Gum's conclusory allegations do not 
plausibly show this or any other conspiracy. See Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 569, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 
929 (2007). "

713,3," See United States v. Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV, No. 1:16-cv-01483 (D.D.C.)."
713,4," Consumers are ""twenty-three consumers and purchasers of beer in the United States"" who reside in Oregon, California, and 
Washington. "
714,5," Consumers' motion to take judicial notice of government documents, court filings, press releases, and undisputed matters of 
public record concerning the ABI-SAB transaction (Dkt. No. 17) is granted."
714,6," The parties agree that the relevant product market is the production and sale of beer, and the relevant geographic market is the 
United States."
714,7," Although our decision in Edstrom is not precedential and we do not rely on it here, it is instructive as to the reality of a 
transaction where ABI acquired no interests in the U.S. market. See Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3. "
715,8," See, e.g., United States v. Pabst Brewing Co., 384 U.S. 546, 550, 86 S. Ct. 1665, 16 L. Ed. 2d 765 (1966) (merger of ""two very

715,9," After briefing on the motion to dismiss, Consumers filed a supplemental declaration with an attached letter written by the 
American Antitrust Institute regarding potential post-merger coordination in the U.S. beer market. That letter was not 
incorporated into the complaint. Regardless, the letter was addressed to the DOJ Antitrust Division to encourage the agency to 
order pro-competitive remedies if it approved the merger, some of which the DOJ adopted in its settlement agreement with ABI. "

716,10," Molson is not a defendant in this action. But if Molson conducts its MillerCoors business in the U.S. beer market in violation of 
the antitrust laws, it does so at the risk of private and public antitrust enforcement suits."
716,11, Consumers do not appeal the district court's decision that allegations about ABI's buying power are too speculative. 
718,1," Unless otherwise noted, the following facts are taken from Pfizer's Complaint. On consideration of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to 
dismiss, the allegations in the plaintiff's complaint are generally taken as true and all reasonable inferences are drawn in favor of 
the claimant. See Phillips v. Cty. of Allegheny, 515 F.3d 224, 233 (3d Cir. 2008). "
730,1," JAL was originally a defendant in this suit, but settled in July, 2014. See Am. Settlement Agreement (dkt. 999-2). JAL remains 
relevant in this motion because a clause of its settlement reserved the right to hold other Defendants jointly and severally liable 
for JAL sales of passenger air transportation, ""to the extent permitted and/or authorized by U.S. law."" Id. ¶ 9."
730,2," Plaintiffs also recently filed a motion to strike certain materials that ANA ""submitted in connection with its memorandum in 
opposition to Plaintiffs' motion for class certification."" Pls.' Mot. to Strike (dkt. 1188). It is not necessary to rely on any of the 
allegedly objectionable materials to answer the dispositive questions in the present motion. Therefore, the Court DENIES this 
motion as moot."
730,3," This ascertainability requirement is not explicitly required by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, but courts in this district 
routinely require plaintiffs to demonstrate it as part of Rule 23 class certification motions. See, e.g., Astiana v. Ben & Jerry's 
Homemade, Inc., No. C 10-4387 PJH, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1640, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 7, 2014) (""[A]part from the explicit 
requirements of Rule 23, the party seeking class certification must also demonstrate that an identifiable and ascertainable class 
exists.""); Viet. Veterans of Am. v. C.I.A., 288 F.R.D. 192, 211 (N.D. Cal. 2012)) (""While it is not an enumerated requirement of 
Rule 23, courts have recognized that . . . 'to maintain a class action, the class sought to be represented must be adequately 
defined and clearly ascertainable.'"" (quoting DeBremaecker v. Short, 433 F.2d 733, 734 (5th Cir. 1970))). In a recent opinion, the Ninth Circuit rejected instituting a ""separate administrative feasibility prerequisite"" for class certification. 
Briseno v. Conagra Foods Inc., 844 F3d 1121, 1123-24 (9th Cir. 2017). However, this is distinct from requiring that classes be 
clearly or objectively defined. See id. at 1124 n.3. "
732,4," Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 97 S. Ct. 2061, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1977) (barring indirect purchasers from recovering 
treble damages for overcharges resulting from a price-fixing conspiracy). "
733,5," Even without express evidence, it is likely that Della Chow did pay the surcharge: Plaintiffs note that that ""ANA and JAL's fuel 
surcharge was applied to all passengers, in all booking classes, for all routes originating in the United States"" during the 
proposed class period. Mot. Class Cert. at 3. "
735,6," Plaintiffs' expert selects two alternatives: a ""Super Value Fare"" and a maerui satogaeri fare. See Mangum Rpt. ¶¶ 203-11. 
Plaintiffs chose this method due to a lack of data, which prevented the use of same type of benchmark model used in the Japan 
Class analysis. See id. ¶ 203 (""The econometric methodology that I implement above to measure the overcharge for Japan class 
members cannot be used for the Satogaeri Class because the misconduct started as early as 1997 and I have no information 
based on the prices that were being charged for Satogaeri fares prior to the start of the alleged cartel behavior.""). "
736,7," Defendant also moves to strike the testimony of Plaintiffs' expert as inadmissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 702 and 
Daubert v. Merrill Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 113 S. Ct. 2786, 125 L. Ed. 2d 469 (1993). Def.'s Mot. to Strike (dkt.

Opp'n at v, 3, 10. Daubert requires courts to ""ensure the reliability and relevancy of expert testimony."" Kumho Tire Co. v. 
Carmichael, 526 U.S. 137, 151-52, 119 S. Ct. 1167, 143 L. Ed. 2d 238 (1999). This requirement is met here: Plaintiffs' expert 
employs widely-recognized and reliable methodologies. See 2A Phillip E. Areeda et al., Antitrust Law: An Analysis of Antitrust 
Principles and Their Application ¶¶ 398-99 (4th ed. 2014). Accordingly, this Court DENIES Defendant's motion to strike. "
737,8," This includes all Satogaeri Class members, and some subset of Japan Class members who purchased their transpacific airfare 
from travel agents. Defendant estimates this subset to be at least 37.5% of the Japan Class. See Opp'n at 10."
737,9," These factors are: ""(a) the class members' interests in individually controlling the prosecution or defense of separate actions; 
(b) the extent and nature of any litigation concerning the controversy already begun by or against class members; (c) the 
desirability or undesirability of concentrating the litigation of the claims in the particular forum; and (d) the likely difficulties in 
managing a class action."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3)(A-D). "
738,10," Although some courts have recognized difficulties in cases of low-cost consumer purchases that customers would have no 
reliable way of remembering, those concerns are not implicated here. See, e.g., Sethavanish v. ZonePerfect Nutrition Co., No. 
12-2907, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18600, 2014 WL 580696, at *6 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 13, 2014); In re POM Wonderful LLC, No. 10-
2199, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 40415, 2014 WL 1225184, at *6 (C.D. Cal. Mar. 25, 2014) (""Few, if any, consumers are likely to 
have retained receipts during the class period"" and ""there is no way to reliably determine who purchased Defendant's [juice] 
products or when they did so.""). "
749,1," An additional copy of Plaintiffs' Opposition was filed at a later time. (ECF No. 1002). Said Opposition is identical to the originally 
filed brief. Accordingly, the Court will rely on the arguments set forth by Plaintiff in their original Opposition. (ECF No. 902)."
749,2," For purposes of brevity, the Court will only cite to the WSSC Amended Complaint whenever the WSSC, Baltimore City, and/or 
Richmond Amended Complaints allege similar facts. Hence, this background is generally derived from Plaintiff WSSC's 
Amended Complaint (""Compl.""), which was originally docketed in Civ. Action No. 17-11416. (ECF No. 1). The Court must accept "
750,," the allegations therein as true at this stage of the proceedings. See Alston v. Countrywide Fin. Corp., 585 F.3d 753, 758 (3d Cir. 
2009)."
750,3," Plaintiffs' contention that Delta Defendants' use of PAC contracts in furtherance of the conspiracy alleged herein is found solely 
in the WSSC Amended Complaint. (ECF No. 555 at ¶ 131). "
752,4," Plaintiff Baltimore City asserts the following claims in its complaint against Delta Defendants: Claim I — Conspiracy in Restraint 
of Trade in violation of the Sherman Act against all Defendants; Claim II — Conspiracy in Restraint of Trade in violation of the 
Maryland Antitrust Act against all Defendants; Claim III — Common Law Fraud against Defendant Delta Chemical; Claim IV — 
Breach of Contract against Defendant Delta Chemical; Claim V — Breach of Contract against Defendant Delta Chemical; and, 
Claim VI — Restitution, Disgorgement, and Unjust Enrichment against Defendant Delta Chemical. (ECF No. 652). Additionally, 
Plaintiff Richmond asserts the following claims in its complaint against Delta Defendants: Count I — Conspiracy in Restraint of 
Trade in violation of the Sherman Act against all Defendants except Defendant Rebecca Besson; Count II — Conspiracy in 
Restraint of Trade in violation of the Virginia Antitrust Act, Va. Code Ann. § 59.1-9.5 against all Defendants except Defendant 
Rebecca Besson; and, Count V — Restitution, Disgorgement, and Unjust Enrichment against all Defendants. (ECF No. 653). As 
will be further explained herein, the analysis for all these claims is nearly identical. Thus, the Court will analyze all claims jointly 
unless there is a substantive reason for a separate analysis. "
759,1," Based on IET's complaint, it appears Illumina sells used sequencing units that are made by Illumina in addition to used units 
made by other manufacturers. (See 2d Am. Compl. ¶ 20 (alleging Illumina's market share is higher in the market of Illumina used 
sequencing units as compared to its market share in the refurbished sequencing unit market generally).)"
759,2," DLL allegedly leases and finances Illumina equipment, and often Illumina sells the instruments and systems to DLL directly. (2d 
Am. Compl. ¶ 21.) "
761,3," IET's Clayton Act claim depends on the survival of its Sherman Act claim because Sections 4 and 16 of the Clayton Act merely 
establish a private right of action for any person injured by a violation of the Sherman Act. 15 U.S.C. § 15."
761,4," Illumina also alleges IET concedes new and used sequencing units are substitutes in use based on language in the Second 
Amended Complaint. (Mem. at 4 (citing 2d Am. Compl. ¶ 5).) We agree with IET that this interpretation of IET's second amended 
complaint misconstrues its language. (Resp. at 6.) Instead of conceding a customer seeking a used unit ""may instead purchase 
a 'new or used sequencing unit' directly from Illumina"" (Mem. at 4), this paragraph merely describes Illumina's alleged sales 
behavior, including threatening the imposition of a site licensing fee ""unless the customer buys or leases a new or used 
sequencing unit directly from Illumina"" (2d Am. Compl. ¶ 5). "
767,5," IET alleges ""Illumina's conduct has resulted in lost sales of preowned Illumina equipment to the following Illinois customers 
dating back to 2010"": (1) the University of Chicago in Chicago, Illinois; (2) Tempus in Chicago, Illinois; (3) Argon National 
Laboratory in Argon, Illinois; and (4) ACGT Inc. in Wheeling, Illinois. (2d Am. Compl. ¶ 45.) IET alleges it lost two separate sales 
of Illumina GA2X systems to the University of Chicago. (Id.) "
769,*, Sitting by designation (R. 346). 
771,1," Comcast argues that Viamedia's Statement of Additional Facts exceeds the court-ordered limit of 75 facts (see R. 315) by 
compounding multiple facts into single paragraphs, and asks the Court to strike the stated facts exceeding that limit. R. 339 at 
25. Although Comcast has a point—Viamedia's fact-packing borders on gamesmanship—the Court, in its discretion, will not 
strike any of Viamedia's stated facts. See Benuzzi v. Bd. of Educ. of Chi., 647 F.3d 652, 655 (7th Cir. 2011) (courts have ""broad 
discretion"" in enforcing local rules). Comcast is (though less so) guilty of the same tactic, and the additional facts Viamedia offers 
do not impact the Court's analysis."
771,2," The Court will refer to Comcast's Rule 56.1 Statement of Undisputed Facts with Viamedia's responses (R. 327) as ""CSF,"" and 
Viamedia's Rule 56.1 Statement of Additional Facts with Comcast's responses (R. 341) as ""VSF."" Unless otherwise noted—
specifically, with a ""Resp. to ¶""—a citation to a paragraph refers to the paragraph itself and not to the opposing party's response."
771,3," Comcast challenges this fact, proffered by Viamedia's expert Dr. Furchtgott-Roth, as unsupported because Dr. Furchtgott-
Roth's opinions are inadmissible. See Furchtgott-Roth Report ¶ 44. Comcast, however, did not move to exclude this opinion 
from Dr. Furchtgott-Roth's report. See R. 211."
771,4," Comcast Cable Communications Management, LLC is a successor to Comcast Spotlight, and it is a wholly owned subsidiary of 
Comcast Corporation. CSF ¶ 5. Both parties nevertheless refer to Comcast's spot cable ad rep business as Spotlight, and so will 
the Court. "
774,5," Viamedia paints these requests by WOW! as ""directly solicited proposals."" VSF ¶ 19. To the extent Viamedia means that 
WOW! sought a direct, interconnect-only deal with Comcast, it is mistaken. The record makes clear that WOW! in 2014 was still 
under contract with Viamedia (and so could not ""directly"" engage Comcast for anything, even an interconnect-only deal), and 
that WOW!'s 2014 request sought ""to get Viamedia back into the Chicago and Detroit interconnects."" Viamedia Ex. 14 at 108:25-
109:4; id. at 105:16-19 (emphasis added). "
776,6," Comcast and Viamedia agree that there is no material difference between the federal antitrust claims and their state-law 
claims. R. 271 at 11 n.3; R. 23 at 15; R. 28 at 15. For the same reasons why Viamedia's federal antitrust law claims fail (as 
explained below), so too does its state-law claims. "
777,7," Viamedia also raised a monopoly-leveraging theory, but that claim is predicated on underlying anticompetitive activity. See 
Schor v. Abbott Labs., 457 F.3d 608, 611-13 (7th Cir. 2006)."
777,8," At the pleading stage, Viamedia also complained that Comcast had threatened to ""shut Viamedia and its MVPD clients out"" of 
using National Cable Communications LLC (""NCC""), a multi-DMA exchange. See Compl. ¶ 59. Viamedia appears to no longer 
pursue that theory, as ""NCC"" is mentioned in neither its response brief nor its Statement of Additional Facts. "
778,9," Belatedly, and despite not designating Dr. Lys as causation expert, Viamedia submitted additional opinions from Dr. Lys, 
including opinions regarding causation. The Court granted Comcast's motion to strike those opinions. R. 283. "
782,10," The Court assumes that Interconnect Services and Ad Rep services are distinct services for tying purposes, and that MVPDs 
""consider"" themselves as receiving Interconnect Services from interconnect operators (like Comcast) even when they have hired 
a unaffiliated Ad Rep (like Viamedia) on a full-turnkey basis. See, e.g., R. 326 at 27."
782,11," As noted, Viamedia does not define Ad Rep Services as exclusive, full-turnkey representation. See, e.g., Furchtgott-Roth 
Report ¶¶ 24-25; R. 326 at 7. Doing so would necessarily defeat its tying claim, for reasons discussed below. "
783,12," Viamedia does not claim a ""negative tie."" See In re Dealer Mgmt. Sys. Antitrust Litig., 313 F. Supp. 3d 931, 2018 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 80937, 2018 WL 2193236, at *20 (N.D. Ill. May 14, 2018). Even if it did, the record would not support it. There is no 
evidence suggesting that Comcast conditioned the sale of Interconnect Services to MVPDs on them agreeing not to purchase 
Viamedia's Ad Rep Services. Cf. Eastman Kodak, 504 U.S. 463 n. 8 (""Assuming, arguendo, that Kodak's refusal to sell parts to 
any company providing service can be characterized as a unilateral refusal to deal, its alleged sale of parts to third parties on 
condition that they buy service from Kodak is not.""). As discussed further below, RCN and WOW! wanted full-turnkey 
representation and at least a portion of their avails sold on the Interconnects; because of Comcast's refusal to deal with 
Viamedia, a full-turnkey agreement with Viamedia could not offer that bundle. "
784,13," Viamedia's attempt to distinguish Aerotec is meritless. It argues that, ""unlike the plaintiff in Aerotec, Viamedia does not 
purchase Interconnect Services for its own account, but rather purchases them on behalf of MVPDs."" R. 326 at 28. How one 
could read Aerotec and conclude that the plaintiff (a repair servicer) purchased replacement airplane parts ""for its own 
account""—as opposed to ""on behalf of"" its airplane-owning customers—is questionable. Like Viamedia, it was precisely because 
the plaintiff could not make available the supposedly tying product (replacement parts) to its customers that its business 
suffered. Aerotec, 836 F.3d at 1177; see also Aerotec Int'l, Inc. v. Honeywell Int'l, Inc., 4 F. Supp. 3d 1123, 1133 (D. Ariz. 2014) 
(""Aerotec asserts that Honeywell's practices amount to per se illegal tying, claiming that Honeywell uses its dominant position in 
the market for Honeywell APU parts to coerce APU owners, who need Honeywell APU component parts for APU repairs, to 
purchase MRO services from Honeywell."") (emphasis added). Whatever Viamedia means by ""on its own account,"" it is an 
economically meaningless distinction in comparing Aerotec to this case."
784,14," The Court recognizes that commentators and courts have remarked on the fact that a refusal to deal with related-market 
competitors—and vertical integration generally—can appear to have a tying effect in certain markets. MCI Communications 
Corp. v. American Tel. & Tel. Co., 708 F.2d 1081, 1144 & n. 96 (7th Cir. 1983) (noting the similarity in the plaintiffs' claims but 
not ""imply[ing] that a tying violation will always flow from any denial of an essential facility by a dominant firm""); Live Nation, 811 
F.3d at 689 (""it is no surprise that vertical integration has generally been permitted despite its apparent similarity to tying""); Glen 
O. Robinson, On Refusing to Deal with Rivals, 87 Cornell L. Rev. 1177, 1178 (2002). Professor Hovenkamp, for example, has 
noted that ""in dominated, path-dependent networks,"" refusals to deal with competitors can resemble ""tying arrangements."" See 
Herbert Hovenkamp, The Obama Administration and Section 2 of the Sherman Act, 90 B.U. L. Rev. 1611, 1642-43 (2010); 
Areeda & Hovenkamp, ANTITRUST LAW ¶ 772. Here, however, there is no tying effect, as no evidence shows that MVPDs cannot 
obtain (from Comcast at least) the tying product alone—they just cannot obtain it through Viamedia's representation. That "
785,," MVPDs typically choose not to obtain the tying product alone underscores the fact that this dispute should be resolved by the 
market, not the courts. "
787,15," Viamedia makes no argument that Comcast effectively and anticompetitively ties Interconnect Services to Ad Rep Services 
through discounted bundling. Nor could it, as no evidence shows that Comcast ever predatorily priced—or even sold below 
cost—its services. See Midwest Gas Servs., Inc. v. Indiana Gas Co., 317 F.3d 703, 713 (7th Cir. 2003). "
788,16," Viamedia's defense of its exclusive dealing claim is near perfunctory. It devotes just a page and a half to this claim in its 46-
page brief, and in the course of that page and a half neither cites a single fact nor raises a single case save for Viamedia I. "
789,17," To the extent Dr. Furchtgott-Roth opines that Comcast has foreclosed Viamedia from the market as a result of its tying or 
exclusive dealing practices, see Furchtgott-Roth Report ¶ 90, those opinions are inadmissible because, for the reasons 
discussed in the text, his predicate opinions regarding the alleged tying and exclusive dealing are inadmissible as they are 
unhelpful to the jury and contrary to the law. In any event, Viamedia's response does not rely on Dr. Furchtgott-Roth's 
foreclosure opinions."
789,18," Viamedia's response does not rely on Dr. Furchtgott-Roth's opinion about exclusive dealing. This opinion, in any event, is 
inadmissible. See Furchtgott-Roth Report ¶¶ 72-73. Constituting just two paragraphs, Dr. Furchtgott-Roth's opinion conflates 
tying and exclusive dealing. He asserts, ""the same conduct by Comcast Spotlight that amounts to tying also amounts to 
exclusive dealing."" Id. ¶ 72. Dr. Furchtgott-Roth, again, applies no expertise, analysis, or study in reaching that conclusion. See "
790,," Fed. R. Evid. 702. He merely posits the broad assertion. Further, because his predicate tying opinions are inadmissible, so too is 
his one-in-the-same exclusive dealing opinion. The Court therefore excludes it. Id. ¶¶ 71-72."
790,19," Viamedia appears to use its catchall theory as protection in case the Court found that Interconnect Services and Ad Rep 
Services are not separate products for tying purposes. See R. 326 at 25 (""In particular, unlike Section 1 tying claims, Section 2 
doctrine does not require Viamedia to establish the existence of separate products""). As noted earlier, the Court has assumed 
that the products are separate. "
792,20," In fact, Viamedia's short shrift of the issue prompts Comcast to argue that Viamedia has waived any argument about causation 
and antitrust injury. R. 339 at 4 n.3. "
793,21," Even assuming arguendo that the but-for world is a place where Comcast decides to permit Viamedia on the interconnects on 
friendly terms, the Court is dubious that Viamedia's lay evidence of causation regarding the loss of future business (the largest 
part of its damages claim) would suffice. Despite Viamedia's pronouncements about its management team's work (e.g., R. 326 
at 40), ""Viamedia's projections"" are not based on any economic price or terms analyses (at least as far as the record is 
concerned). Viamedia's refrain that it need not examine prices because the Ad Rep market is a ""relationship business"" is 
convenient; there is in fact no specific evidence showing that Viamedia could have competed with Comcast on price. See CSF 
¶¶ 116-122 (Comcast, on average, offered better revenue shares to MVPDs than Viamedia). Further, not a single MVPD 
testified that it would have selected Viamedia but for its lack of interconnect access. Viamedia did not hire an expert to opine on 
causation, and lay persons are generally forbidden from doing precisely as Viamedia's management does here—testify 
regarding ""hypotheticals or assumptions"" about what might have happened in the future. Gumwood HP Shopping Ptrs. L.P. v. 
Simon Prop. Grp., Inc., 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 110070, 2017 WL 3016385, at *4 (N.D. Ind. July 17, 2017). In short, this 
multimillion-dollar antitrust case is ""far removed from situations in which a causation issue is so obvious that a plaintiff may forgo 
expert testimony."" Dalton, 891 F.3d at 691. The Court, however, need not ultimately decide whether Comcast has presented 
sufficient evidence with respect to this part of its damages case because Viamedia has failed to meet its threshold burden to 
show an issue of fact as to whether the any of the damages it seeks stem from unlawful conduct. "
802,1, Plaintiff filed no response to Defendants' Motion to Exclude Expert Testimony of Professor Cornelius K. Hurley. 
805,2," The Court notes that ""[a]lthough an unpublished opinion is not binding on this court, it is persuasive authority. See 11th Cir. R. 
36-2."" United States v. Futrell, 209 F.3d 1286, 1289 (11th Cir. 2000)."
805,3," Because the Court finds that Bray's claims are barred by Bray IV, it need not address Defendants' contention that the claims 
are barred by Bray II."
805,4," Maritz was the majority shareholder of American Express Incentive Solutions (""AEIS"") and had requested that the lenders 
permit it to acquire the minority shares of AEIS. (Dkt. 116 at 4) The lenders required additional collateral for the purchase of the 
AEIS shares, and in 2009, the loan agreement was amended. (Id.; Dkt. 26 at ¶ 30). Provision 7.16 of the loan agreement states: Within forty-five (45) days after the date AEIS becomes a Subsidiary, AEIS shall open, maintain and otherwise have all 
investment accounts that contain bond mutual funds at Bank of America (or its Affiliates) and shall have entered into a 
control agreement with, or have agreed to other arrangements granting ""control"" (within the meaning of Article 9 of the 
applicable Uniform Commercial Code) to, the Administrative Agent, in each case, in form and substance reasonably 
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. (Dkt. 129 at ¶ 10) "
827,1," Mylan has filed a Request for Oral Argument on their Motion to Dismiss under D. Kan. Rule 7.2. Doc. 220. D. Kan. Rule 7.2 
provides: ""The court may set any motion for oral argument or hearing at the request of a party or on its own initiative."" After 
reviewing the parties' written submissions, the court finds that they explain the parties' positions quite effectively. The court 
concludes that oral argument will not assist its work and thus, to grant it, would contradict Fed. R. Civ. P. 1. It is, simply, 
unnecessary. Exercising its discretion, the court denies Mylan's request."
827,2," The Class Complaint uses the term ""EpiPen"" to refer to the EpiPen®, EpiPen 2-Pak®, EpiPen Jr.®, EpiPen Jr. 2-Pak®, My 
EpiPen®, LIFE HAPPENS®, EpiPen4Schools®, Never-See-Needle®, and Be Prepared®. Like the Class Complaint, the court 
refers to these devices collectively as the ""EpiPen"" and omits the ® for readability. "
835,3, The class plaintiffs assert their tying claim just against the Mylan Defendants—not the Pfizer Defendants. 
837,4," Mylan's Reply—filed after the court issued its Sanofi Order—concedes that the Sanofi Order decided against this argument and 
states that Mylan is not relitigating the issue. Doc. 219 at 18 n.5. But Mylan's Reply incorporates the arguments made in its 
opening brief and preserves the issue for further review. Id. "
839,5," The Mylan Defendants also assert that ""[a]t best, Plaintiffs allege that Mylan engaged in legitimate state and federal lobbying 
efforts to allow schools to participate in the program"" and that the Noerr-Pennington doctrine shields such conduct from antitrust 
liability. Doc. 95 at 46. But the class plaintiffs do not base their antitrust claims on Mylan's lobbying activities. Instead, the claims 
are premised on Mylan's alleged anticompetitive conduct in offering free and discounted EpiPens to school districts but making 
those offers contingent on the school districts entering into illegal exclusive dealing agreements with Mylan. The Mylan 
Defendants never argue that the Noerr-Pennington doctrine immunizes that alleged anticompetitive conduct—i.e., the conduct 
on which the class plaintiffs base their antitrust claims for the EpiPen4Schools program. "
840,6," The Mylan Defendants also argue that the Class Complaint never alleges that Mylan was a party to or participated in the patent 
litigation with Teva, Intelliject, or Sandoz. Thus, the Mylan Defendants argue, the Class Complaint fails to state a claim against 
them based on the patent litigation and settlements. As explained in the following subsection (see infra Part III.A.4.), the court 
concludes that plaintiffs have alleged a plausible conspiracy between Mylan and Pfizer that included their coordinated scheme to 
initiate patent litigation against potential competitors in the EAI market, and then, to settle those lawsuits by agreeing to pay 
those potential competitors to postpone entry into the market. The court thus rejects the Mylan Defendants' argument that the 
Class Complaint never alleges that they participated in the patent litigation and settlements. "
843,7," The parties do not cite, and the court's research has not located, any Tenth Circuit cases discussing the viability of antitrust 
claims based on reverse payment settlements. The court predicts that the Tenth Circuit, if presented with this issue, would find 
In re Sologyn persuasive and apply its reasoning to the facts alleged here."
843,8," The Mylan Defendants' opening brief asserts that the class plaintiffs' claims—premised on alleged reverse payment 
settlements—are evaluated under a rule of reason analysis—not the per se rule. Doc. 52 at 106-07; see also FTC v. Actavis, 
Inc., 570 U.S. 136, 159, 133 S. Ct. 2223, 186 L. Ed. 2d 343 (2013) (holding that courts must apply a rule of reason analysis to 
reverse payment settlement agreements alleged to violate the antitrust laws). The class plaintiffs' response concedes that an 
individual reverse payment settlement is analyzed under a rule of reason analysis. Doc. 64 at 151 n.203. But, the class plaintiffs 
assert, their conspiracy claims are not based just on the reverse payment settlements. Id. Instead, they argue, that the court 
must look to the totality of the conduct allegedly supporting the conspiracy claims. Id. But they never cite any case law showing 
that the per se rule applies to that other conduct that, they contend, supports their conspiracy claim. Id. Nevertheless, at this stage of the litigation, the court need not decide what rule to apply to analyze the reasonableness of the 
alleged restraints of trade supporting the class plaintiffs' conspiracy claims. See CSR Ltd. v. Fed. Ins. Co., 40 F. Supp. 2d 559, 
564 (D.N.J. 1998) (""At this early [motion to dismiss] stage of the proceeding, the court does not find it necessary to determine 
which mode of analysis [per se or rule of reason] it will ultimately employ in evaluating the defendants' activities.""); see also 
Swarthmore Radiation Oncology, Inc. v. Lapes, 812 F. Supp. 517, 520 (E.D. Pa. 1992) (""[The court] need not decide, at this 
stage of the proceedings, whether a per se rule or a 'rule of reason' applies.""). In ruling the pending motion, the court just needs 
to determine whether the class plaintiffs have alleged a plausible conspiracy under the antitrust laws. The class plaintiffs have 
shouldered that burden here. "
844,9," This paragraph of the Class Complaint asserts other alleged unlawful conduct supported the alleged conspiracy—such as the 
EpiPen misclassification, the exclusivity contracts offered through the EpiPen4Schools Program, deceptive marketing practices, 
the ""hard switch"" to the EpiPen 2-Pak, and false testimony to Congress. But the Pfizer Defendants argue that the Class 
Complaint makes no factual allegations capable of supporting a finding or inference that Pfizer participated in any of this other 
alleged conspiratorial conduct. The court agrees. The court thus confines its discussion to the factual allegations supporting 
Pfizer's alleged involvement in an antitrust conspiracy to exclude EpiPen competitors—i.e., the Class Complaint's allegations 
about Pfizer's involvement in securing patents, initiating patent infringement litigation, and entering into unlawful reverse 
payment settlements."
844,10," The Orange Book is the common name for the FDA's publication, Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence 
Evaluations. See Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (Orange Book), U.S. Food & Drug 
Administration, (2018), https://www.fda.gov/drugs/informationondrugs/ucm129662.htm. According to the FDA, the Orange Book 
""identifies drug products approved on the basis of safety and effectiveness by the [FDA] under the Federal Food, Drug, and 
Cosmetic Act (the Act) and related patent and exclusivity information."" Id. "
850,11," In the same vein, the Mylan Defendants argue that the Citizen Petition never delayed the FDA approval process because the 
FDA ultimately denied Teva's application. But, for reasons explained in Part III.A.3. above, the Class Complaint adequately 
alleges ""[b]ut for Mylan's anticompetitive assault campaign""—described in the Class Complaint as the patent settlement 
litigation, reverse payment settlements, and FDA Citizen Complaint—""Teva would have entered the market much sooner and 
fixed the deficiencies that led to the FDA's rejection of Teva's generic."" Class Compl. ¶ 322. As the court concluded already, 
these allegations sufficiently allege causation. They also support the class plaintiffs' claim that Mylan's FDA Citizen Petition 
delayed Teva's entry into the market. "
851,12," The Mylan Defendants also recognize another type of deceptive speech that the Class Complaint appears to allege to support 
an antitrust claim. The class plaintiffs assert that Mylan failed to disclose the ""bought-and-paid-for"" physician statements 
supporting the EpiPen 2-Pak. Doc. 95 at 60. The Mylan Defendants assert that these allegations cannot support an antitrust 
claim based on deceptive speech because they involve omissions—not deceptive statements. The class plaintiffs' Opposition 
never responds to this argument. Doc. 123 at 58-60. And instead, it confines its arguments to allegedly false statements that 
Mylan made about the Auvi-Q. Id. The court thus concludes that the class plaintiffs have abandoned any attempt to base their 
deceptive speech claims on Mylan's failure to disclose that it allegedly paid physicians for their statements supporting the 
EpiPen 2-Pak. The court thus dismisses any of the class plaintiffs' antitrust deceptive speech claims based on this alleged failure 
to disclose. "
852,13," The class plaintiffs assert that the de minimis test applies only to competitors asserting a deceptive speech claim—not 
consumers like the class plaintiffs here. But they cite no case law supporting this argument. And the Mylan Defendants respond 
that the Ninth Circuit has applied the de minimis presumption to competitors and consumers alike. See Am. Prof'l Testing Serv., 
Inc. v. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Legal & Prof'l Publ'ns, Inc., 108 F.3d 1147, 1152 (9th Cir. 1997) (explaining that the court 
""insist[s] on a preliminary showing of significant and more-than-temporary harmful effects on competition (and not merely upon a 
competitor or customer) before [disparaging of a rival product] can rise to the level of exclusionary conduct"" (emphasis added)). 
Without any authority supporting the class plaintiffs' position, the court declines to hold the de minimis test does not apply to their 
claims here. "
853,14," The Class Complaint names only one plaintiff who resides in Arizona—Cassandra Bredek. Class Compl. ¶ 14. But Ms. Bredek

855,19," Plaintiffs assert their Arkansas antitrust claim under Ark. Code Ann. § 4-75-212(b). Class Compl. ¶ 562.d. That statute 
authorizes the Attorney General to sue on behalf of persons injured ""directly or indirectly."" Ark. Code Ann. § 4-75-212(b). Other 
courts have dismissed indirect purchaser claims brought under similar provisions in the Arkansas Unfair Practices Act because 
they do ""not provide for a private individual to bring an action and only permit[ ] actions by the Attorney General."" In re Cast Iron

enrichment actions"")."
855,20," The Massachusetts Supreme Court has held that ""indirect purchasers can assert claims for price-fixing or other 
anticompetitive conduct under [Mass. Gen. Laws ch.] 93A § 9, where they have no standing [otherwise] to bring such claims 
under the Massachusetts Antitrust Act [Mass. Gen. Laws ch.] 93 §§ 1-14A."" Ciardi v. F. Hoffmann-La Roche, Ltd., 436 Mass. 53, 
762 N.E.2d 303, 306 (Mass. 2002) (emphasis added). Here, the class plaintiffs assert their state antitrust claim under the latter 
chapter that Ciardi discusses, i.e. Mass. Gen. Laws Ch. 93, § 1 et seq. Class Compl. ¶ 562.l. And, as Ciardi holds, an indirect 
purchaser has no standing to sue under this chapter. Ciardi, 762 N.E.2d at 306."
855,21," The class plaintiffs' response asserts that the Missouri Merchandising Practices Act, Mo. Rev. Stat. §§ 407.020, does not bar 
indirect purchaser suits. But that's not the Missouri antitrust statute that the Class Complaint asserts to support its state antitrust 
claim. Instead, the Class Complaint relies on Mo. Rev. Stat. § 416.011, et seq. And, as several courts have held, ""Missouri's 
antitrust laws . . . prohibit recovery by indirect purchasers."" In re Lithium Ion Batteries Antitrust Litig., No. 13-MD-2420-YGR, 
2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 141358, 2014 WL 4955377, at *19 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 2, 2014); see [**114]  also In re Asacol Antitrust Litig.,

S.W.2d 821, 824 (Mo. Ct. App. 1999). "
864,22," Although defendants cite a District of New Mexico case to support their argument, the cited case never holds that indirect 
purchasers lack RICO standing. See N.M. Oncology & Hematology Consultants, Ltd. v. Presbyterian Healthcare Servs., 54 F. 
Supp. 3d 1189 (D.N.M. 2014). Instead, the New Mexico court applied Supreme Court and Tenth Circuit precedent to determine 
whether plaintiff had alleged proximate causation because ""proximate cause is necessary to confer [RICO] standing."" Id. at 
1244; see also id. at 1245 (""To have standing to pursue these claims, Plaintiff must allege facts that support a finding of 
proximate cause.""). "
869,23, The Class Complaint asserts the state consumer protection law claims just against Mylan. Class Complaint ¶¶ 683-93. 
873,24," The Mylan Defendants also assert that Ms. Bresch's statements to Forbes are not actionable because she did not make them 
to consumers. For support, the Mylan Defendants cite Group Health Plan, Inc. v. Philip Morris, Inc., 68 F. Supp. 2d 1064 (D. 
Minn. 1999). In that case, the Minnesota federal court dismissed plaintiffs' claims asserted under the Minnesota consumer 
protection laws because the complaint ""contain[ed] no allegations that Defendants were attempting to sell their products"" when 
they made the alleged misrepresentations while testifying before Congress. Id. at 1069. Also, plaintiffs ""[did] not allege that they 
purchased any products from Defendants."" Id. Those facts differ significantly from the ones here. The class plaintiffs have alleged that they purchased the EpiPen. Also, the class plaintiffs allege that Ms. Bresch made the false 
statements to Forbes as part of defendants' scheme to monopolize the market and inflate the EpiPen's price. It is plausible to 
infer from the Class Complaint's allegations that Ms. Bresch directed the statements to consumers—through an interview with a 
nationally circulated magazine—as part of defendants' scheme to sell the EpiPen to consumers at inflated prices. "
875,25," The Mylan Defendants assert that public policy supports Mylan's freedom to set prices for the EpiPen—as its patent holder—
because the exclusivity granted by patent rights encourages innovation. Here, the class plaintiffs allege that Mylan did more than 
simply set prices as a patent holder. Instead, the Class Complaint alleges that Mylan engaged in various anticompetitive and 
fraudulent competition for the purpose of restraining competition. The court recognizes that these are just allegations in the 
Class Complaint, but the court must accept them as true facts on a motion to dismiss. Taking them as true, public policy does 
not favor this type of conduct."
875,26," The Mylan Defendants also assert that the class plaintiffs fail to allege a claim under California's Unfair Competition Law 
(""UCL""). This law requires a plaintiff to allege that defendant violated some other law. See Moran v. Prime Healthcare Mgmt., 
Inc., 3 Cal. App. 5th 1131, 208 Cal. Rptr. 3d 303, 311 (Cal. Ct. App. 2016) (explaining that ""violation of another law is a predicate 
for stating a cause of action under the UCL's unlawful prong"" (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)). As the court 
already has concluded, the class plaintiffs plausibly have alleged that defendants (including Mylan) violated other laws—
including the antitrust laws and RICO. These allegations suffice to support a plausible claims under the California UCL. "

878,28," The class plaintiffs argue that Syngenta differs because that case involved only money damages—not claims for injunctive 
relief like the class plaintiffs seek here. The court is not persuaded by this argument. HN64[
] Indeed, one Colorado court 
recently has concluded that the Colorado Consumer Protection Act does not permit a plaintiff to seek injunctive relief ""on behalf 
of either himself or a class."" Carter v. Amica Mut. Ins. Co., No. 17-cv-02156-RM-MEH, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 104802, 2018 WL 
3093320, at *9 (D. Colo. June 22, 2018) (citation omitted). The Mylan Defendants have not moved the court to dismiss the class 
plaintiffs' claims for injunctive relief under the Colorado Consumer Protection Act for this reason. Their motion only seeks 
dismissal of the class claims generally. For reasons explained above, the court defers ruling this issue until later in the litigation. "
879,29," See Doc. 569. After the class plaintiffs filed a voluntary dismissal of the only class plaintiff residing in Idaho (Doc. 555), the 
Mylan Defendants filed a Notice asking the court to dismiss the Idaho consumer protection claim for the same reasons asserted 
in their previously filed Motion to Dismiss because a named plaintiff no longer exists in the Class Complaint."
879,30," The Class Complaint names only one plaintiff who resides in Indiana—Alene McDaniel. Class Compl. ¶ 29. But Ms. McDaniel 
voluntarily dismissed her claims on July 31, 2018. Doc. 829. So the Class Complaint contains no named plaintiff residing in 
Indiana."
879,31," See Doc. 569. The Notice described in note 29 supra also seeks dismissal of the Louisiana consumer protection claim 
because the class plaintiffs filed a voluntary dismissal of the only class plaintiff residing in Louisiana (Doc. 549)."
879,32," The Class Complaint names only one plaintiff who resides in Washington—Connie Stafford. Class Compl. ¶ 61. But Ms. 
Stafford voluntarily dismissed her claims on July 24, 2018. Doc. 811. So the Class Complaint contains no named plaintiff 
residing in Washington. "
880,33," The Class Complaint names only one plaintiff who resides in Wyoming—Curt Palmer. Class Compl. ¶ 64. But Mr. Palmer 
voluntarily dismissed his claims on February 7, 2018. Doc. 139. So the Class Complaint contains no named plaintiff residing in 
Wyoming."
880,34, The Class Complaint asserts the unjust enrichment claim against just Mylan. Class Compl. ¶¶ 1421-28.
880,35," The class plaintiffs agree that the Mylan Defendants' chart provides the elements of unjust enrichment claims under the 
various state laws asserted in the Class Complaint. See Doc. 123 at 147 n. 581. "
885,1, 21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(5)(B)(iv).
885,2," Walker Process Equipment, Inc. v. Food Machinery & Chemical Corp., 382 U.S. 172, 86 S. Ct. 347, 15 L. Ed. 2d 247 (1965). "
886,3," In July 2000 and August 2001, Warner-Lambert acquired Patent Nos. 6,274,740 ('740 Patent) and 6,087,511 ('511 Patent). (Id. 
at ¶ 219). According to the Complaint, ""[b]oth the '740 and '511 Patents are process patents, which claim a specific process for 
making amorphous atorvastatin calcium using crystalline Form I atorvastatin as a starting material."" (Id.). However, while the 
Process Patents were valid and enforceable, they had no exclusionary effect. (Id. at ¶ 308). Put differently, the Process Patents 
could not be used to exclude any generic brands of Lipitor from the market. (Id.). "
890,4," Defendants appear to be leading the Court down the same path where it was the last time — no sense putting my fingers over 
the fire a second time. "
893,5," It should be noted that during oral argument, EPPs' attorney contended that notice was provided, ""I'm the one who gave notice 
in this case; I gave — first of all we gave a demand to the defendants back in 2012, with respect to all states . . . so that has 
been fulfilled."" (Tr. of June 25, 2018 Hearing at 58:35-59:4). To me, this meant Plaintiffs gave notice in accordance with the state 
statutes. I have no reason to disbelieve Plaintiffs' counsel, who is an officer of the Court. However, no competent proof 
supporting this assertion has been provided to the Court."
893,6," Courts have understood this notice requirement to apply only to claims of ""unfair methods of competition,"" not ""unfair or 
deceptive acts or practices""; however, neither party addresses this distinction. See In re Chocolate Confectionary Antitrust Litig., 
749 F. Supp. 2d 224, 243-33 (M.D. Pa. 2010); In re Flash Memory Antitrust Litig., 643 F. Supp. 2d 1133, 1158 (N.D. Cal. 2009). "
894,7," Defendants also make a similar argument for Plaintiff's Illinois consumer protection claims; however, being that the Illinois 
Consumer Fraud & Deceptive Business Practice Act does not explicitly bar class actions, the Court finds it more appropriate to 
consider the substantive arguments Defendants present later."
894,8," At the outset, it should be noted that neither party provided any post-Shady Grove analysis or discussion to support their 
position. "
895,9," From the Court's perspective, in agreement with Justice Stevens, the state statutes at issue focus on various forms of 
deceptive practices. Rule 23 is more generic and applies to all class actions. As such, the narrower and more focused approach 
of the state should apply. "
896,10," Both Alabama and Georgia's consumer protection statutes contain similar language to Montana, Tennessee, and Utah, which 
all prohibit the use of class actions to enforce the rights created therein. Ala. Code Ann. § 8-19-10(f) (""A consumer or other 
person bringing an action under this chapter may not bring an action on behalf of a class""); Ga. Code Ann. § 10-1-399(a) (""Any 
person who suffers injury or damages . . . as a result of consumer acts or practices in violation of this part . . . may bring an 
action individually, but not in a representative capacity""). "
900,11," Because the Court has already dismissed EPPs' claims under Massachusetts, Montana, Tennessee, Utah and West Virginia's 
consumer protection statutes, it does not address the remaining arguments pertaining to these states."
900,12," Moreover, it should be noted that, at the pleading stage it is difficult to determine whether Plaintiff's claims under California law 
are even based on fraudulent conduct; as such, the Court also finds Defendants' motion to be premature. "
901,13," In their brief in opposition to Defendants' motion, EPPs make explicitly clear that they ""have not alleged a claim based on 
group boycott."" (Pls' Brief in Opp. at 41). "
909,1," ""Novartis"" refers collectively to all three Novartis entities that are defendants: Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, Novartis 
Corporation, and Novartis AG. "
910,2," Novartis also applied for and obtained a third patent for Gleevec -- Patent No. 7,554,799, later reissued as Patent No. RE 
43,932 -- which the complaints allege is invalid for the same reasons that Patent '051 is invalid. The plaintiffs discuss only Patent 
'051, however, on appeal."
910,3," The plaintiffs allege that other generic drug manufacturers also filed ANDAs for generic versions of Gleevec, each of which 
certified that Novartis's second patent for the drug, Patent '051, is invalid. Because Novartis sued each of these generic drug 
manufacturers for patent infringement within forty-five days of receiving notice of such certifications, Novartis obtained automatic "
911,," thirty-month stays of FDA approval as to each of those ANDAs. See 21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(5)(B)(iii). The plaintiffs represent on 
appeal that all of these additional infringement suits have been dismissed without prejudice."
911,4," The plaintiffs clarified in their papers below that they ""do not assert the Orange Book listings as a basis for antitrust liability."" 
They explained that they instead asserted them as the basis of a third exception to Noerr-Pennington [**9]  immunity. However, 
they have not pressed this argument on appeal."
911,5," The end-payer plaintiffs have filed an unopposed motion to amend their notice of appeal, which we provisionally granted and 
now finally grant. "
912,6," Walker Process concerned antitrust liability under the federal Sherman Act. 382 U.S. at 173. The parties assume that the 
Walker Process doctrine applies to the state antitrust laws at issue in the end-payers action as well. We note that the Supreme Court has, since Walker Process, reserved the question ""whether and, if so, to what extent Noerr 
permits the imposition of antitrust liability for a litigant's fraud or other misrepresentations."" PREI, 508 U.S. at 61 n.6 (citing 
Walker Process, 382 U.S. at 176-77). Neither party suggests to us, however, that, in light of PREI, Walker Process is not an 
available exception to Noerr-Pennington. So we proceed on the assumption that it is. "
913,7," The complaints allege that there was additional prior art disclosing imatinib mesylate that was never provided to the Patent 
Office. But, the plaintiffs do not contend that these references disclosed anything of relevance to Novartis's patent application 
other than the mesylate salt of imatinib that the submitted references had already disclosed. See Rothman v. Target Corp., 556 
F.3d 1310, 1326 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (""A piece of prior art is not material to patent prosecution when it is cumulative of information 
already before the examiner."" (citing 37 C.F.R. § 1.56(b))). "
914,8," At oral argument, the plaintiffs asserted that Novartis's representation in this portion of its patent application from 2000 as to the 
timing of the β-crystalline discovery -- namely, that it had just ""now"" been made and that it was thus a ""new"" crystalline form -- 
also effected a fraud on the Patent Office, independent of the use of the word ""surprisingly."" The plaintiffs argue that the use of 
the words ""now"" and ""new"" meant Novartis was presenting a false chronology, given the complaints' allegation that the β-
crystalline form, ""upon information and belief, was used by Novartis from August 1993 forward."" But, although the plaintiffs' 
opposition brief below did allude to that allegation, the plaintiffs did not sufficiently raise below a Walker Process argument that, 
but for Novartis's use of the words ""now"" and ""new,"" the patent would not have issued. See United States v. Slade, 980 F.2d 27, 
30 (1st Cir. 1992) (explaining that ""[p]assing allusions are not adequate to preserve an argument""). Nor was this argument 
developed in their briefs to us. See Shell Co. (P.R.) Ltd. v. Los Frailes Serv. Station, Inc., 605 F.3d 10, 19 (1st Cir. 2010) 
(holding that an argument developed at oral argument but not in a party's briefs is deemed waived). "
916,9," In addition to invoking this ""objectively baseless"" test from PREI, the plaintiffs also urge us to apply the test from California 
Motor Transport Co. v. Trucking Unlimited, 404 U.S. 508, 92 S. Ct. 609, 30 L. Ed. 2d 642 (1972), which they argue is a different 
test that applies to allegations that a pattern of petitioning activity, as opposed to a single petition, was a ""sham."" The plaintiffs 
contend that this case involves such a pattern because their complaint alleges that Novartis sued not only Sun Pharma but also 
other generic manufacturers that had filed ANDAs for generic versions of Gleevec. However, the plaintiffs concede in their reply 
brief that ""Novartis rightly points out that the end payers did not argue below that California Motor should apply."" And, contrary to 
their assertion otherwise, our recent decision in Puerto Rico Telephone Co. v. San Juan Cable LLC, 874 F.3d 767 (1st Cir. 
2017), does not excuse the forfeiture of that argument, which was no less available to them to make before that decision. "
917,10," The plaintiffs do point to the Supreme Court of India's 2013 decision not to issue what they describe as Novartis's ""Indian 
equivalent"" of Patent '051. But, this effort fails. As indicated by a copy of that decision in the record, the India Supreme Court 
was applying a different patentability standard than under United States law. As the court explained there, under Indian law, ""the 
mere discovery of a new form of a known substance"" is not a ""new product"" ""unless they differ significantly in properties with 
regard to efficacy."" By contrast, under our law, a patent may be obtained so long as the differences between the claimed 
invention and the prior art were not so minimal that the invention was ""obvious . . . to a person having ordinary skill in the art to 
which the claimed invention pertains."" 35 U.S.C. § 103. "
925,1," However, 23 does not assert infringement of claim 26 in the instant case. "
926,2," The use of the term ""Inheritance by Descent"" appears to be an error. Rather, the correct term is ""Identical by Descent."""
926,3," Of course, even though preemption concerns are ""the basis for the judicial exceptions to patentability . . . , the absence of 
complete preemption does not demonstrate patent eligibility."" Ariosa Diagnostics, Inc. v. Sequenom, Inc., 788 F.3d 1371, 1379 
(Fed. Cir. 2015). "
927,4," ""If a law of nature is not patentable, then neither is a process reciting a law of nature, unless that process has additional 
features that provide practical assurance that the process is more than a drafting effort to monopolize the law of nature itself."" 
Mayo, 566 U.S. at 77. "
932,5," The system and computer program product described in claims 31 and 37 involve generic computer components. HN9[
] 
Under Alice, the ""mere recitation of a generic computer cannot transform a patent-ineligible abstract idea into a patent-eligible 
invention."" Alice, 134 S. Ct. at 2358 (adding that, ""[g]iven the ubiquity of computers, wholly generic computer implementation is 
not generally the sort of 'additional feature[]' that provides any 'practical assurance that the process is more than a drafting effort 
designed to monopolize the [abstract idea] itself""). "
933,6," The Court acknowledges Ancestry's contention that the patent claims at issue are directed to an abstract idea — i.e., 
comparing similarities between DNA, similar to the situation in BRCA. However, the Court need not reach the question whether 
BRCA additionally justifies a finding that step one is satisfied. The Court finds it more appropriate, in the instant case, to consider 
the act of comparing at step two of the Alice test."
933,7," Claim 8 refers to use of a distribution pattern, but 23 does not claim to have applied a novel distribution pattern."
933,8," Compare Vanda Pharms. Inc. v. West-Ward Pharms. Int'l Ltd., 887 F.3d 1117, 1134 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (finding claims patent 
eligible; distinguishing Mayo on the ground that ""the claims in Mayo were not directed to a novel method of treating a disease"" "
934,," but rather ""were directed to a diagnostic method based on the 'relationships between concentrations of certain metabolites in the 
blood and the likelihood that a dosage of a thiopurine drug will prove ineffective or cause harm'"")."
934,9," To the extent Plaintiffs argue that the Court should not find patent ineligibility here because there is no danger that basic 
building blocks of scientific research will not be monopolized, the Court is not persuaded. HN10[

940,10," In MedImmune, the Supreme Court questioned the Federal Circuit's reasonable-apprehension-of-suit test. See, e.g., 
MedImmune, 549 U.S. at 132 n.11. Following MedImmune, the Federal Circuit stated that, [w]hile the Supreme Court rejected the reasonable apprehension of suit test as the sole test for jurisdiction, it did not 
completely do away with the relevance of a reasonable apprehension of suit. Rather, following MedImmune, proving a 
reasonable apprehension of suit is one of multiple ways that a declaratory judgment plaintiff can satisfy the more general 
all-the-circumstances test to establish that an action presents a justiciable Article III controversy. Prasco, LLC v. Medicis Pharm. Corp., 537 F.3d 1329, 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2008). "

over some of whom the court indisputably has personal jurisdiction—in which all defendants collectively challenge the legal 
sufficiency of the plaintiff's cause of action, we may address first the facial challenge to the underlying cause of action and, if we 
dismiss the claim in its entirety, decline to address the personal jurisdictional claims made by some defendants.""). Because 
Plaintiffs fail to state a claim, as will be explained, the Court declines to address personal jurisdiction and venue. "
950,14," As will be explained, because Plaintiffs fail to plausibly allege antitrust standing, the Court need not address whether Plaintiffs 
have adequately alleged a conspiracy in violation of the antitrust laws. Cf. Concord Assocs., L.P. v. Entm't Props. Tr., No. 12 
Civ. 1667 (ER), 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 186964, 2014 WL 1396524, at *10 n.7 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 9, 2014) (""Since the Court may

[p]laintiffs have adequately alleged conduct in violation of the antitrust laws.""), aff'd, 817 F.3d 46 (2d Cir. 2016)."
950,15," The suitability of the plaintiff is often described as whether the plaintiff is an ""efficient enforcer"" of the antitrust laws. In re 
Aluminum Warehousing Antitrust Litig., 833 F.3d 151, 157-58 (2d Cir. 2016)."
950,16," ""While some courts speak of 'antitrust injury' comprehensively to include"" all three of these elements, the third element 
specifically is sometimes referred to as ""antitrust injury."" 2A Phillip E. Areeda, Herbert Hovenkamp, et al., Antitrust Law: An 
Analysis of Antitrust Principles and Their Application ¶ 337a, at 99-100 (4th ed. 2014)."
950,17," Although absent putative class members may have been counterparties to and injured by manipulated transactions referenced 
in the chat logs, this is insufficient to establish injury to the named Plaintiffs. See W.R. Huff, 549 F.3d at 106 n.5 (""[N]amed 
plaintiffs in a class action 'must allege and show that they personally have been injured, not that injury has been suffered by 
other, unidentified members of the class to which they belong and which they purport to represent.'"" (emphasis omitted) (quoting 
Warth, 422 U.S. at 502)). "
951,18," The requirement of ""actual damages"" or ""actual injury"" under the Commodity Exchange Act is similar to the requirement of 
injury-in-fact under the Clayton Act. Total Gas, 889 F.3d at 111, 115-16 (holding that the plaintiffs satisfied neither for similar 
reasons)."
951,19," To be sure, pleading an ""actual adverse effect in the marketplace"" or ""harm to competition [is] not required to withstand a 
motion to dismiss when the conduct challenged is a per se violation."" Gelboim, 823 F.3d at 775-76; see generally Capital 
Imaging Assocs., P.C. v. Mohawk Valley Med. Assocs., Inc., 996 F.2d 537, 542 (2d Cir. 1993) (stating that per se violations,

competitive values that they are 'conclusively presumed illegal without further examination'"" (quoting Broad. Music, Inc. v. 
Columbia Broad. Sys., Inc., 441 U.S. 1, 8, 99 S. Ct. 1551, 60 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1979))). But regardless of any per se violation, 
Plaintiffs are still required to plausibly allege harm to them, and one way of doing so is through an analysis of market prices."
951,20," Plaintiffs admit that ""there is no literature (yet) studying the precise effect that Defendants' reduction of competition had in the 
USD SSA bond market."" Pls.' Merits Opp'n 48."
951,21," The alleged collusion appears to be over or at least significantly reduced since ""all or nearly all of the key participants in the 
cartel were removed from their positions"" in late 2015 or early 2016 as their employers and government investigators became 
aware of the conspiracy. CAC ¶ 314."

952,23," [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] Plaintiffs ask the Court to infer that the depicted conduct took place continuously over 
an eleven-year Class Period. CAC ¶¶ 5, 404."
952,24," Plaintiffs urge the Court to infer that their transactions with the Dealer Defendants injured them because Defendants' 
""agreement not to compete is illegal per se."" Pls.' Merits Opp'n 45. ""For standing purposes, however, whether there was or was 
not a per se violation is irrelevant."" Balaklaw v. Lovell, 14 F.3d 793, 800 (2d Cir. 1994); see also Atl. Richfield Co. v. USA 
Petroleum Co., 495 U.S. 328, 341-42, 110 S. Ct. 1884, 109 L. Ed. 2d 333 (1990) (""The per se rule is a method of determining 
whether § 1 of the Sherman Act has been violated, but it does not indicate whether a private plaintiff has suffered antitrust injury 
. . . .""). ""Regardless of any substantive violation of the Sherman Act,"" Plaintiffs must still plausibly allege that Defendants 
""engaged in anticompetitive conduct that caused them an antitrust injury."" Balaklaw, 14 F.3d at 800. Plaintiffs rely on New York 
v. Hendrickson Bros., 840 F.2d 1065 (2d Cir. 1988), which held that ""[i]n general, the person who has purchased directly from 
those who have fixed prices at an artificially high level in violation of the antitrust laws is deemed to have suffered the antitrust 
injury,"" but that case is not to the contrary. Id. at 1079. Plaintiffs must still plausibly allege that the prices that they paid were 
fixed at an artificially high level. See Arista Records, 532 F. Supp. 2d at 568-69 (""Although such a horizontal price-fixing 
arrangement is per se unlawful under § 1 of the Sherman Act, [counter-plaintiff] has not established that it suffered injury-in-fact 
as a result of counter-defendants' purported arrangement."" (citation and footnote omitted)). "
953,25," Defendants' requests for oral argument on the motions and Plaintiffs' request for a conference concerning possible 
jurisdictional discovery are denied as moot. "
955,1," Select Portfolio Motion and Select Portfolio RJN are identical documents. Counsel for Select Portfolio submitted the document 
twice."
955,2," Ditech argues that the Court should deem the Ditech Motion unopposed as Plaintiffs' Ditech Opposition was filed late. (Ditech 
Reply at 1.) The Court declines to do so. Furthermore it would be unnecessary because the Court grants Ditech's motion and 
dismisses Plaintiffs' Complaint."
955,3, Plaintiffs presumably meant to say they submitted a complete loan modification application. 
962,4," Plaintiffs' Complaint has irregular numbering starting with their fifth cause of action. Instead of continuing with ¶ 65, Plaintiffs re-
start their numbering with ¶ 24. This numbering continues through ¶ 27 and then jumps back to ¶ 65. For this Part, citations to ¶¶ 
24-27 will refer to ¶¶ 24-27 alleged under the fifth cause of action. "
972,1," The Defendant Blue Plans named in the Complaint are: Wellpoint, Inc., allegedly an Indiana corporation that, combined with its 
affiliates, serves more than 71 million people in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, New York, Maine, 
Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, Ohio, Virginia, and Wisconsin, or more than a third of all privately insured Americans; 
Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey, allegedly the largest health insurer in New Jersey; Blue Cross and Blue Shield of 
Minnesota, which allegedly has more members, products, and services than other insurers in that state; BlueCross BlueShield of 
South Carolina; and Highmark, Inc., allegedly one of the largest health insurers in the country serving, with affiliates, insureds in 
Pennsylvania, Delaware, and West Virginia. As described later, LifeWatch has since settled its case against Highmark."
972,2," LifeWatch's brief on appeal explains that the ""Medical Policy Panel"" is ""the name Defendants give to themselves acting in 
concert."" Appellant Br. 3. However, we see no basis in the pleadings on which to infer who or what the panel comprises."
972,3," The Complaint references only two Blue Plans that ever contracted with LifeWatch to cover telemetry. One, a Plan in Illinois, 
settled with LifeWatch outside this lawsuit. As described later, the other, Highmark, partially changed course and stopped 
covering telemetry in some cases. The claims against Highmark were dismissed on June 9, 2016, after the parties reached a 
settlement. "
973,4," A monopoly exists if only ""one supplier or producer"" has ""control or advantage . . . over the commercial market within a given 
region."" Black's Law Dictionary 1160 (10th ed. 2014). If ""one buyer controls the market"" instead of a seller, that is a monopsony. 
Id. Likewise, if ""a few large sellers"" have ""control or domination of a market,"" it is an oligopoly, while oligopsony is where ""a few 
large buyers or customers"" do. Id. at 1260. "
975,5," As we have noted in the criminal conspiracy context, ""common sense suggests, and experience confirms, that illegal 
agreements are rarely, if ever, reduced to writing or verbalized with the precision that is characteristic of a written contract."" 
United States v. McKee, 506 F.3d 225, 238 (3d Cir. 2007)."
975,6," Although LifeWatch's claim against Highmark has been dismissed, it and other unsued Blue Plans remain alleged 
coconspirators to the purported agreement. Thus their conduct can be evidence of the agreement's existence."
975,7," The Complaint also gestures at a motive to conspire when it describes the Defendants' shared goal to save costs and increase 
profits by shifting demand to less expensive treatment options. However, in our case law the mere desire to shift demand to 
lower cost devices is not a plus factor establishing an agreement without further evidence ""of concerted, collusive conduct."" 
Burtch, 662 F.3d at 229 (quoting In re Baby Food Antitrust Litig., 166 F.3d 112, 137 (3d Cir. 1999)). ""In a free capitalistic society, 
all entrepreneurs have a legitimate understandable motive to increase profits."" Id. (same). "
976,8," Some horizontal restraints may warrant only a ""quick look,"" rather than a complete rule-of-reason analysis. See F.T.C. v. Ind. 
Fed'n of Dentists, 476 U.S. 447, 459, 106 S. Ct. 2009, 90 L. Ed. 2d 445 (1986); see also Ohio v. Am. Express Co., 138 S. Ct. 
2274, 2285 n.7, 201 L. Ed. 2d 678 (2018). A quick look ""presum[es] competitive harm without detailed market analysis"" because 
""the anticompetitive effects on markets and consumers are obvious."" Deutscher Tennis Bund, 610 F.3d at 832. It is inappropriate 
if ""'the contours of the market' . . . are not 'sufficiently well-known or defined to permit the court to ascertain without the aid of 
extensive market analysis whether the challenged practice impairs competition . . . .'"" Id. (quoting Worldwide Basketball &Sport 
Tours, Inc. v. Nat'l Collegiate Athletic Ass'n., 388 F.3d 955, 961 (6th Cir. 2004))."
976,9," We note that some group boycotts, which are similar to concerted refusals to deal, are treated as unlawful per se. Ind. Fed'n of 
Dentists, 476 U.S. at 458. But ""the category of restraints classed as group boycotts is not to be expanded indiscriminately, and 
the per se approach has generally been limited to cases in which firms with market power boycott suppliers or customers in 
order to discourage them from doing business with a competitor,"" id., which LifeWatch does not allege here. "
979,10," We note that LifeWatch allegedly began offering a lowerpriced ""Elite"" monitor after Highmark's decision to stop covering 
telemetry monitors in part. However, the Complaint suggests that the Elite product still costs LifeWatch the same amount to 
make and that it operates at less-than-optimal performance, as it is a standard telemetry monitor with some functions either not 
provided or disabled. LifeWatch's Elite monitor allegations illustrate that medical device sellers may not be able to change their 
inventories readily in response to changing buyer preferences. No allegations support a contrary inference. "
980,11," Standing is a term for ""[a] party's right to make a legal claim or seek judicial enforcement of a duty or right."" Black's Law 
Dictionary 1625 (10th ed. 2014). Constitutional standing derives from Article III of the U.S. Constitution, which limits the federal 
court's ""judicial power,"" or jurisdiction, to deciding ""cases"" or ""controversies."" U.S. Const. art. III, § 2; see also Spokeo, Inc. v. 
Robins, 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1547, 194 L. Ed. 2d 635 (2016). For a federal court to have jurisdiction over any claim, ""[t]he plaintiff 
must have (1) suffered an injury in fact, (2) that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant, and (3) that is likely 
to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision."" Id. at 1547. "
984,1, Both parties have consented to the jurisdiction of a magistrate judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(c). (Dkt. Nos. 6 & 9.) 
989,2," Defendants also contend that this claim is barred by the statute of limitations. The statute of limitations for the intentional 
infliction of emotional distress is two years. See Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 335.1 (identifying two-year statute of limitations); 
Pugliese v. Superior Court, 146 Cal. App. 4th 1444, 1450, 53 Cal. Rptr. 3d 681 (2007)(""Causes of action for assault, battery and 
intentional infliction of emotional distress are governed by the two-year statute of limitations set forth in Code of Civil Procedure 
section 335.1.""). Because the complaint was filed May 8, 2017, the offensive phone call—which occurred in November 2013—
cannot be the basis for the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim. (Dkt. No. 16-2 at ¶ 47). However, Plaintiff contends 
that some of the conduct of which she complains occurred within two years of the filing of the complaint. (Dkt. No. 30 at 13:8-9.) 
The Court is uncertain how this can be the case given that the complaint alleges that Ralph Lauren terminated its relationship 
with Plaintiff on May 8, 2015—exactly two years prior to the filing of the complaint. (Id. at ¶ 76.) Plaintiff will nonetheless be 
granted leave to amend this claim to the extent that she has a good faith basis to allege outrageous conduct that occurred within 
the two-year statute of limitations. "
991,3," Defendants also insist that Plaintiff's Unruh Act claim is barred by the one-year statute of limitations. The actual statute of 
limitations for Unruh Act claims is somewhat unsettled. See Kemp v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., No. C-09-4687 PJH, 2010 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 79654, 2010 WL 2889224, at *6 (N.D. Cal. July 22, 2010) (discussing split within the California appellate courts and 
the absence of Ninth Circuit or California Supreme Court authority on point). Because this issue has not been fully briefed and 
the basis for Plaintiff's discrimination claim is unclear, the Court declines to address this issue now; however, the parties should 
address this issue should Plaintiff amend this claim. "
1005,1," The Court also heard argument on a separate motion to dismiss brought by Defendants Lear Corporation and Kyungshin-Lear 
Sales & Engineering, LLC. This motion will be addressed in a separate opinion and order. "
1011,2," In its brief in opposition to Defendants' motion, GEICO indicates that it made at least some of these direct purchases in its 
capacity as the owner of ""thousands of vehicles (provided for use by its adjusters and other employees) as part of its fleet 
program."" (Plaintiffs' Response Br. at 4.) As Defendants observe, however, these alleged purchases as a fleet owner are not 
expressly identified as such in the complaint, and a plaintiff ordinarily may not ""amend [its] complaint through a response brief."" 
Jocham v. Tuscola County, 239 F. Supp.2d 714, 732 (E.D. Mich. 2003). Nonetheless, given that GEICO has been directed to file 
a separate suit for each of the eighteen part-specific conspiracies identified in its present complaint, the Court will allow GEICO 
to address this pleading deficiency when it commences these separate actions, particularly where it already has alleged that it 
made direct purchases of relevant auto parts, and simply did not identify the fleet-owner context in which some of these 
purchases were made. "
1014,3," As noted earlier, to the extent that the allegations of GEICO's present complaint do not clearly set forth a theory of recovery 
based on GEICO's status as the owner of a fleet of vehicles, GEICO will have an opportunity to address this deficiency in the 
pleadings it files in response to the Court's rulings in this opinion and order. "
1017,4," In some more recent cases, the proposed classes do not include indirect purchasers of replacement parts, but only those 
individuals or entities who have purchased or leased new vehicles. (See, e.g., Ascher v. Alpha Corp., No. 16-13997, Dkt. 1, 
Complaint at ¶¶ 143-44 (part of the Access Mechanisms Actions, No. 16-04103).) The EPP settlements identified by 
Defendants, however, encompass these indirect purchases of replacement parts. "
1019,5," In its response to Defendants' motion, GEICO suggests that Defendants' protest against duplicative recovery should be viewed 
as ""a case of buyers' remorse,"" where Defendants agreed to settlement classes in the multidistrict litigation that ""included 
automobile insurers"" among the indirect purchasers of replacement parts, but then failed to negotiate settlement terms that 
accounted for the situations in which ""automobile insurers [we]re the party paying for"" these replacement parts. (Plaintiffs' 
Response Br. at 20 n.16.) In GEICO's view, ""[b]ecause automobile insurers pay for the vast majority of replacement parts in the 
United States,"" Defendants' negotiation of settlement agreements that frequently result in payments to two parties arising from a 
single purchase of replacement parts reflects a missed opportunity to craft settlement classes that account for this marketplace 
reality. (Id.) As Defendants observe, however, any such potential for duplicative recoveries among members of the settlement classes in the 
multidistrict litigation is unhelpful to GEICO in establishing antitrust standing in this case. Rather, GEICO must show that the 
AGC factors, including the risk of duplicative recovery, favor a finding of antitrust standing under the circumstances presented 
here, and it is wholly immaterial that insurers who are similarly situated to GEICO have been included in settlement classes in 
the multidistrict litigation without having to make this showing. GEICO could have obtained this benefit by participating in the 
settlements, but it instead elected to opt out and pursue its own claims. "
1023,6," Of course, to the extent that the Court has determined elsewhere in this opinion and order that GEICO's claims as an insurer 
are defeated on other grounds, it need not decide whether these claims were released under the EPP settlements. This 
includes, most notably, GEICO's claims under antitrust law resting upon repair, replacement, and total loss payments made 
pursuant to GEICO's policies with its insureds. "
1027,7," As Defendants observe, HN29[
] athough each overt act starts a new period of limitation for claims arising from this act, ""the 
commission of a separate new overt act generally does not permit the plaintiff to recover for the injury caused by old overt acts 
outside the limitation period."" Klehr, 521 U.S. at 189, 117 S. Ct. at 1990-91. Accordingly, Defendants argue that GEICO should 
not be permitted to recover ""for acts (and damages) that are alleged to have occurred years outside any applicable limitations 
period,"" and they have provided a chart summarizing the purported cut-off dates for recoverable auto part purchases under the 
relevant statutes of limitation of various states that govern each of the state law theories of recovery asserted by GEICO. (See 
Defendants' Reply Br. at 20-21 (citing Defendants' Reply, Exhibit B).) Plainly, however, GEICO cannot be expected at this juncture to identify and allege each individual auto part sale for which it 
seeks to recover, so this matter cannot be resolved in the context of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion. Moreover, it is possible, as already 
discussed, that the accrual of claims arising from earlier auto part sales might be deferred by resort to discovery rules or the 
doctrine of fraudulent concealment, and this again is not an issue that is amenable to resolution through a motion to dismiss. "
1034,8," In their reply brief, Defendants do not address GEICO's consumer protection claim under Florida law, but instead suggest for 
the first time that GEICO's claim under New York's consumer protection law must be pleaded with particularity. (See Defendants' 
Reply Br. at 23-24.) Because this argument was advanced for the first time in Defendants' reply brief, the Court declines to 
consider it. See Sundberg, 189 F. Supp.2d at 682-83. "
1040,9," It also is worth noting that the Illinois decision cited by Defendants here, Martis v. Grinnell Mutual Reinsurance Co., 388 Ill. App. 
3d 1017, 905 N.E.2d 920, 928, 329 Ill. Dec. 82 (Ill. App. Ct. 2009), has been called into doubt as ""not an accurate statement of 
the [Illinois] law on the equitable claim for unjust enrichment,"" National Union Fire Insurance Co. v. DiMucci, 2015 IL App (1st) 
122725, 393 Ill. Dec. 495, 34 N.E.3d 1023, 1043 (Ill. App. Ct. 2015). "
1042,1," The United States also filed an ""Amended Response"" the day after filing its Response, and one day after its deadline to 
respond to Horma's Motion to Dismiss. (ECF No. 22.) No motion accompanied the ""Amended Response."" The Court will not 
consider the Amended Response."
1042,2," Local Rule of Criminal Procedure 47 governs motions in criminal cases. Local Criminal Rule 47(F)(1) prescribes the timeline by 
which parties must file response and reply briefs to criminal motions. See E.D. Va. Loc. Crim. R. 47(F)(1). It also states: ""No 
further briefs or written communications may be filed without first obtaining leave of Court."" Id. "
1043,," The United States did not seek leave of Court to file its Sur-Reply, instead declaring that some of Horma's arguments in his 
Reply ""warrant[] only a brief response."" (U.S. Reply 1, ECF No. 25.) E.D. Va. Local Criminal Rule 47 provides that the Court 
(and not a party) determines the need for additional briefing. See E.D. Va. Loc. Crim. R. 47(F)(1). The Court will disregard the 
Sur-Reply."
1043,3," At the hearing, the parties presented the record unconventionally. They did not have a list of proposed stipulations or a 
complete version of exhibits. An oral recitation of stipulated facts proved unfruitful: the United States could not identify important 
dates, and gave conflicting dates for some events. The United States also offered, contrary to local rules, only unredacted 
versions of exhibits that included sensitive identifying information about Horma. So as not to further delay the hearing, the Court directed the parties to jointly file redacted exhibits and written stipulations. At the 
end of the hearing, the parties requested until close of business July 12, 2017, to make this joint filing, which the Court ordered. 
On July 12, 2017, Horma filed an Unopposed Motion for Leave, seeking additional time to file the Stipulations. (ECF No. 40.) 
Soon thereafter, Horma filed the Stipulations. (ECF No. 42.) The Court will grant the Motion for Leave. (ECF No. 40.)"
1043,4," Section 1158(d)(2) provides that [a]n applicant for asylum is not entitled to [*3]  employment authorization, but such authorization may be provided under 
regulation by the Attorney General. An applicant who is not otherwise eligible for employment authorization shall not be 
granted such authorization prior to 180 days after the date of filing of the application for asylum."
1043,8, U.S.C. § 1158(d)(2). 
1044,5," The United States asserts in briefing that this date was later advanced to August 3, 2018. (Resp. Mot. Dismiss 3.) The United 
States submitted no stipulation or exhibit supporting this assertion. No evidence before the Court indicates that Horma's hearing 
before an immigration judge might occur on a date other than March 2, 2021. To date, neither party has reported that a hearing 
has occurred."
1044,6," Horma asserts in briefing that he has ""submitted to biometrics administered by immigration officials[, and] attended all 
scheduled interviews[,]"" to facilitate a full adjudication of his Asylum Application. (Mot. Dismiss 2.) This claim has no bearing on 
the Court's holding."
1044,7," The Maryland Tax Statute provides that [a] person who willfully ships, imports, sells into or within, or transports within, [Maryland] cigarettes or other tobacco 
products on which the tobacco tax has not been paid in violation of [various regulations governing the sale and 
transportation of cigarettes] is guilty of a felony and, on conviction, subject to the penalties set forth in subsections (b) and 
(c) of this section. Md. Code, Tax-Gen. § 13-1015(a)."
1044,8," Section 13-1014 of the Maryland Tax Code provides that ""[a] person who willfully possesses, sells, or attempts to sell 
unstamped or improperly stamped cigarettes in [Maryland] in violation of [various regulations governing the sale and 
transportation of cigarettes] is guilty of a misdemeanor."" Md. Code, Tax-Gen. § 13-1014(a)(1)."
1044,9," Horma's arraignment occurred without the benefit of an interpreter. Given Horma's presentation in this Court, and having 
reviewed the record, nothing that occurred in the Howard County Court gives the Court pause."
1044,10," The United States asserted in its briefing that: (1) on November 16, 2016, Horma was arrested in Albemarle County on 
charges of Possession of Cigarettes with the Intent to Distribute; (2) law enforcement executed a search warrant on Horma's 
vehicle, during which they uncovered a receipt for a firearm purchased for cash on November 12, 2016, from the War Store; (3) 
the Ruger recovered during the search of Horma's residence was found in Horma's bedroom dresser; and, (4) Horma admitted 
that he ""had taken the gun from the purchaser"" and kept it in his room. (Resp. Mot. Dismiss 4-5.) The United States put none of 
these facts before the Court in the form of either exhibit or stipulation. The Court, therefore, will not consider them in ruling on 
the Motion to Dismiss. "
1045,11," The Superseding Indictment contains only typographical changes, and charges Horma with the same five crimes arising from 
the same alleged conduct as the original Indictment. Although the United States filed the Superseding Indictment after much of 
the briefing on the Motion to Dismiss concluded, the parties' arguments regarding the original Indictment apply with equal force 
to the Superseding Indictment. The Court did not order new briefing after the United States filed the Superseding Indictment, nor 
did Horma seek any. For clarity, the Court refers to the Superseding Indictment, throughout this Memorandum Opinion."
1045,12," In briefing, the United States expanded on the facts underlying the charges in the Superseding Indictment. Specifically, the 
United States asserted that, underlying the charges in Counts One and Three, on September 21, 2016, Horma went to a 
Richmond shooting range and rented a gun and ammunition, which he paid for using his credit card. As to the charges in Counts 
Two, Four, and Five, the United States contended that, on November 12, 2016, Horma and an unidentified individual went to a 
federally licensed firearms dealer, where the unidentified individual purchased a handgun and ammunition. Horma and the 
individual returned to Horma's residence, and Horma put the handgun in his bedroom dresser. The United States introduced no 
stipulation or exhibit supporting these facts, however. The Court therefore will not consider these facts in ruling on the Motion to 
Dismiss."
1045,13, Horma does not challenge Count Five in the Motion to Dismiss. 
1047,14," Agency ""interpretations contained in policy statements, agency manuals, and enforcement guidelines, all of which lack the 
force of law—do not warrant"" the level of deference given under Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. NRDC, 467 U.S. 837, 104 S. Ct. 2778, 
81 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1984). Christensen v. Harris Cty., 529 U.S. 576, 587, 120 S. Ct. 1655, 146 L. Ed. 2d 621 (2000). The USCIS's 
interpretation ""is nonetheless 'entitled to respect ... to the extent that [its] interpretations have the power to persuade.'"" FDIC v. 
Cashion, 720 F.3d 169, 179 (4th Cir. 2013) (quoting Christensen, 529 U.S. at 587). The Court finds the USCIS's interpretation of 
the interaction between lawful status, period of authorized stay, and unlawful presence to be reasonable and persuasive."
1047,15," An alien may regain legal status after his or her status has changed to illegal status. For example, if an alien has timely filed 
an application for extension of status or change in status that USCIS then grants, his or her immigration status reverts back to 
legal status as of ""the date the adjustment application [was] filed."" USCIS Policy Manual ch. (E)(1). "
1048,16," Title 8, Section 1182(a)(9)(B)(iii)(II) states: No period of time in which an alien has a bona fide application for asylum pending under section 1158 of this title shall be 
taken into account in determining the period of unlawful presence in the United States under clause (i) unless the alien 
during such period was employed without authorization in the United States."
1048,8, U.S.C. § 1182(a)(9)(B)(iii)(II).
1048,17," An alien may also be in illegal immigration status, have already accrued some unlawful presence time, but not currently 
accruing additional unlawful presence time. This situation occurs when an alien does not timely file for a change of status or 
extension of status, but files once his or her immigration status has become illegal. The Adjudicator's Field Manual states that 
""[a] grant of asylum does not eliminate any prior periods of unlawful presence."" Adjudicator's Field Manual ch. 40.9 (F)(ii). If an 
alien files for asylum after his or her immigration status has become unlawful, then he or she will not accumulate any additional 
unlawful presence from the date he or she files his or her application, but he or she will be subject to the days already 
accumulated at the time he or she filed for asylum. Id. While the record plainly demonstrates that Horma filed for asylum, it 
remains silent as to whether he ever filed for an extension of status."
1048,18," While not relevant here, if an alien filed the application while in illegal immigration status, then he or she would accrue 
unlawfully present days beginning the day after his or her visa expires until the day he or she files his or her asylum application. 
See Adjudicator's Field Manual ch. 40.9(F)(ii). And any subsequently-filed asylum application would not retroactively convert 
unlawfully present days into lawful presence, but it does prevent the applicant from accruing additional unlawful presence. Id. "
1049,19," The Court cannot resolve factual uncertainties on a pre-trial motion and the factual record must drive the legal analysis. See 
Weaver, 659 F.3d at 355 n * (concluding that a district court may rule on a pretrial motion to dismiss ""where the government 
does not dispute the ability of the court to reach the motion and proffers, stipulates, or otherwise does not dispute the pertinent 
facts"")."
1049,20," Per Weaver, the Court may rule on motions in criminal cases by relying on stipulated facts to make legal determinations. 659 
F.3d at 355 n. *. In the alternative, all factual uncertainties must be submitted to the fact finder at trial."
1049,21," If USCIS grants Horma's asylum application, then that approval may convert Horma's immigration status to legal status. See 
USCIS Policy Manual vol. 7, pt. B, ch. 3 (E)(1). "
1050,22," An asylum applicant can only become eligible for work authorization 180 days after filing his or her asylum application. 8 
U.S.C. § 1158(d)(2)."
1050,23," If, in fact, Horma's immigration status has become illegal, but his presence has not become unlawful, the statute may not apply 
to Horma. A question would exist whether Horma was ""in"" the United States ""unlawfully or illegally"" to a degree that would 
establish that element of the offense. The Court cannot decide that knotty issue here. "
1053,24," Horma argues that, when interpreting statutes that include the phrase ""relating to,"" courts have given ""relating to"" broad 
meaning, and therefore the Qualifying Phrase, ""the phrase 'relating to the regulation of business practices' should likewise be 
given a broad meaning sufficient to cover transportation of unstamped cigarettes."" (Mot. Dismiss 11.) The Supreme Court of the 
United States has instructed that the doctrine of noscitur a sociis (it is known by its associates), ""while not an inescapable rule, is 
often wisely applied where a word [or phrase] is capable of many meanings in order to avoid the giving of unintended breadth to 
the Acts of Congress."" Jarecki v. G.D. Searle & Co., 367 U.S. 303, 307, 81 S. Ct. 1579, 6 L. Ed. 2d 859, 1961-2 C.B. 254 (1961). 
Given the relevant principles of statutory interpretation, and given that the specific language ""antitrust violations, unfair trade 
practices, [and] restraints of trade"" precedes ""offenses relating to business practices,"" Horma's proposed broad reading of the 
Qualifying Clause cannot prevail. "
1056,25," ACCA's Residual Clause defines a violent felony as including any felony that ""involves conduct that presents a serious 
potential risk of physical injury to another."" 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B)(ii)."
1056,26," Johnson's finding of vagueness also rested on the uncertainty created by using the ""ordinary case"" analysis coupled with a 
qualitative standard. This ""ordinary case"" analysis follows from the requirement that a court ""[d]eciding whether the residual 
clause covers a crime . . . picture the kind of conduct that the crime involves in 'the ordinary case,' and . . . judge whether that 
abstraction presents a serious potential risk of physical injury."" Johnson, 135 S. Ct. at 2557. This categorical approach requires 
courts in the sentencing context to apply the facts considering a so-called ordinary case of the offense, instead of contemplating 
the facts underlying the defendant's previous conviction. See Mathis v. United States, 136 S. Ct. 2243, 2251, 195 L. Ed. 2d 604 
(2016); see also 3 Charles Alan Wright & Sarah N. Welling, Federal Practice and Procedure § 549 (4th ed. 2018) (describing 
that the categorical approach governs when ""the government seeks to use a previous conviction to increase the sentence being 
imposed for the current conviction,"" and is used to analyze ""whether the previous conviction qualifies to increase the sentence""); 
 [*38] Chapman v. United States, No. 1:16cv512, 326 F. Supp. 3d 228, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 121172, 2018 WL 3470304, at * 
11 (E.D. Va. July 19, 2018), appeal filed by United States v. Chapman (4th Cir. 2018) (""As the Supreme Court explained in 
Johnson, one of the predominant features of the ACCA residual clause that gave rise to its unconstitutional indeterminacy was 
that it did not limit the risk-of-force analysis to the conduct surrounding the elements of the crime but instead required courts to 
'imagine' how a stylized version 'of the crime subsequently plays out.'"" (quoting Johnson, 135 S. Ct. at 2557-58))."
1056,27," Regarding the uncertainty as to the nature of a crime that carries a ""serious potential risk,"" the Supreme Court noted that other 
laws using terms like ""substantial risk,"" ""grave risk,"" and ""unreasonable risk"" . . . . [did not] link[] a phrase such as ""substantial risk"" to a 
confusing list of examples. ""The phrase 'shades of red,' standing alone, does not generate confusion or unpredictability; but "
1057,," the phrase 'fire-engine red, light pink, maroon, navy blue, [*39]  or colors that otherwise involve shades of red' assuredly 
does so."" Johnson, 135 S. Ct. at 2561 (quoting James v. United States, 550 U.S. 192, 230 n.7, 127 S. Ct. 1586, 167 L. Ed. 2d 532 (2007) 
(Scalia, J., dissenting)). ACCA's Residual Clause, however, ""forces courts to interpret 'serious potential risk' in light of the four 
enumerated crimes—burglary, arson, extortion, and crimes involving the use of explosives[, each of which is] . . . 'far from clear 
in respect to the degree of risk each poses.'"" Id. at 2558 (quoting Begay v. United States, 553 U.S. 137, 143, 128 S. Ct. 1581, 
170 L. Ed. 2d 490 (2007)). This lack of clarity contributed to the statute's unconstitutional vagueness."
1057,28," Horma describes the analysis in these cases as inapposite because each was decided before Johnson, and thus ""do[] not 
address the contention . . . that the reasoning of Johnson applies to § 921(a)(20)."" (Reply Mot. Dismiss 6, ECF No. 24.) 
Undergirding Johnson's holding of unconstitutional vagueness, however, was the fact that the enumerated crimes [in ACCA] were themselves too varied to provide . . . assistance. Trying to reconcile them with each 
other, and then [*41]  compare them to whatever unlisted crime was at issue drove many a judge a little batty. And more to 
the point, the endeavor failed to bring any certainty to [ACCA's Residual Clause's] application. Dimaya, 138 S. Ct. at 1221. The enumerated offenses in the Business Practices Clause, however, lack such incongruity. 
Nothing in the subsequent history of these cases indicates that their vagueness holdings were abrogated by Johnson, and 
counsel for Horma stated at oral argument that he had not seen anything indicating such an abrogation. (July 9, 2018 Tr. 41, 
ECF No. 43.) Horma's argument under Johnson fails to persuade. "
1059,29," Heller identified the ""core"" Second Amendment right as ""the right of a law-abiding, responsible citizen to possess and carry a 
weapon for self-defense."" Chester, 628 F.3d at 683 (emphasis omitted) (citing Heller, 554 U.S. at 634-35). "
1060,30," The Court makes no determination at this point about what level of scrutiny would apply to Horma's Second Amendment 
claim, noting only that, on this record, intermediate scrutiny likely would apply to Horma's Second Amendment challenge. The Fourth Circuit has held that ""laws burdening 'core' Second Amendment conduct receive strict scrutiny, while less severe 
burdens receive only intermediate scrutiny."" Hosford, 843 F.3d at 168 (citing Masciandaro II, 638 F.3d at 471). Heller identified 
the ""core"" Second Amendment right as ""the right of a law-abiding, responsible citizen to possess and carry a weapon for self-
defense."" Chester, 628 F.3d at 683 (emphasis omitted) (citing Heller, 554 U.S. at 634-35). Because both parties agree that 
Horma is not a citizen, Horma could not likely invoke the core Second Amendment right. See id. (holding that Chester's Second 
Amendment claim ""is not within the core right identified in Heller . . . by virtue of Chester's criminal history as a domestic violence 
misdemeanant""). The parties remain free to argue otherwise."

1069,1," Nestlé uses susceptor sleeves to package certain food products. Hot Pockets, for example, are packaged in a foldable and 
tearable susceptor sleeve that serves the dual function of browning and crisping as well as providing a holder for carrying the 
Hot Pocket. First Lorentz Decl. Ex. 55 [Docket No. 553]. "
1070,2," The issue of patent infringement had been a component of Graphic and Nestlé's relationship. In a 2012 email discussing 
moving sleeve business from Graphic to Inline, Nestlé employee Shannon Gavie (""Gavie"") told Nestlé's head of packaging 
procurement, Lou Judge (""Judge""), to ""be careful given [Graphic's] likelihood to want to sue us."" Second Lorentz Decl. Ex. 173 
[Docket No. 884]. Judge and Gavie respectively characterized Graphic as ""litigation happy"" and ""Patent happy and like to

hereinafter, Chef America will be referred to as Nestlé when discussing events that occurred prior to Nestlé's acquisition of Chef 
America. "
1073,4," Inline also alleged that Graphic engaged in the anti-competitive practice of ""baiting/submarine patent activities."" Compl. ¶¶ 55-
58; 106-10. Claims based on this theory of antitrust liability were dismissed by the Court in February 2016. See Mem. Op. Order,

1078,7," There is no current Eighth Circuit precedent addressing the applicable standard for evaluating bundling claims. In 2010, the 
Eighth Circuit analyzed a discount bundling theory in which the Court seemed to, at least implicitly, endorse a discount bundling 
test that requires a below cost pricing component after attributing the entire discount on all products within a package to the 
competitive product. See Southeast Missouri Hosp. v. C. R. Bard, Inc., 616 F.3d 888, 893 (8th Cir. 2010) (""Bard I""). However, 
this decision was vacated shortly after its publication and decided on alternative grounds while making no reference to the 
discount bundling theory. See Southeast Missouri Hosp. v. C. R. Bard, Inc., 642 F.3d 608 (8th Cir. 2011) (""Bard II""). Because 
Bard [**39]  I was vacated, this Court gives it no precedential value in determining how, in the future, the Eighth Circuit may 
evaluate a discount bundling claim. "
1080,8," Dr. Levinsohn also opined that market power is not necessary for an incumbent to foreclose a new entrant when only a fraction 
of shares are contestable in a given time period. Hicks Decl. Ex. 6 [Docket No. 644] (""Levinsohn Rebuttal"") ¶ 18. However, the 
example he provides to support this proposition involves a single-product hypothetical. Id. This hypothetical does not support 
Inline's allegations that Graphic has willfully maintained its monopoly in susceptor packaging by bundling it with a second 
product—paperboard packaging. See Compl. ¶¶ 81-88. "
1081,9," Inline argues that support for the contestable share analysis can be found in a Competitive Impact Statement filed in U.S. v. 
United Regional Health Care Sys., No. 11-00030, 2011 WL 13054949 (N.D. Texas Feb. 25, 2011). The Competitive Impact 
Statement is a document filed in the case by the government in connection with a proposed final judgment. Moreover, the 
document acknowledges that the contestable share method differs from the PeaceHealth test, and that measuring the 
contestable share ""may in some cases be impractical."" Id. "
1083,10," In January 2018, Inline moved to amend its Complaint to add a claim for punitive damages. Among the changes in the 
Proposed Amended Complaint are 9 additional paragraphs in the ""Discount Bundling"" section. See Redlined Proposed Am. 
Compl. [Docket No. 504, Attach 2] ¶¶ 29-37. The added paragraphs describe Graphic's supply contracts as ""bundled, exclusive 
requirements contracts"" which gave Graphic the right to supply a customer for a multi-year term, and allege that ""Graphic knew 
that the bundled requirements would tie up the vast majority of the market, thereby foreclosing Inline from selling susceptor food 
packaging to any contracted food company buyers, and that such a result would have anticompetitive effects."" Id. ¶¶ 29, 35. 
However, exclusive dealing is not among the theories of liability listed in the Proposed Amended Complaint. Rather, the stated 
theories are: discount bundling, sham litigation and threats thereof, interference with business relationships, misappropriation 
and misuse of intellectual property, and baiting/submarine patent activities. See generally, id. Moreover, Inline's stated purpose 
in seeking to amend the Complaint was solely to plead punitive damages, not to add a claim for exclusive dealing. See Pl.'s 
Mem. Supp. Mot. Am. Compl. [Docket No. 381] at 1, 42. "

1092,6," There have been several lawsuits by cable television customers claiming that their cable television providers unlawfully tied the 
provision of cable services to the rental of set-top boxes. In a few of these lawsuits, Circuit Courts have rejected the claims. See 
In re: Cox Enterprises, Inc., 871 F.3d 1093 (10th Cir. 2017); Kaufman v. Time Warner, 836 F.3d 137 (2d Cir. 2016)."
1092,7," Comcast still has pending motions to compel arbitration. In part, these motions seek to compel individual arbitration of the 
Sherman Act and Washington state law claims."
1092,8," For instance, in In re Cox Enterprises, Inc. Set-Top Box Antitrust Litig., No. 09-ML-2048-C, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 149656, 
2011 WL 6826813, at *16 (W.D. Okla. Dec. 28, 2011), a similar antitrust tying case against a different cable television provider, 
the district declined to certify a national class, holding that market power and antitrust injury could not be proven on a national 
level and would require multiple regional analyses. "
1093,9," Courts have preliminarily approved class action settlements where the litigation is in its early stages and limited or no formal 
discovery has occurred. See, e.g., In re Nat'l Football League Players Concussion Injury Litig., 821 F.3d 410, 436-37 (3d Cir. 
2016), as amended (May 2, 2016) (""In some cases, informal discovery will be enough for class counsel to assess the value of 
the class' claims and negotiate a settlement that provides fair compensation.""); Linney v. Cellular Alaska P'ship, 151 F.3d 1234, 
1239 (9th Cir. 1998) (In regards to class action settlements, ""'formal discovery is not a necessary ticket to the bargaining table' 
where the parties have sufficient information to make an informed decision about settlement."" (quoting In re Chicken Antitrust 
Litig. Am. Poultry, 669 F.2d 228, 241 (5th Cir. 1981)). "
1094,10," Former Subscribers are ""Class Members who were cable television subscribers of Comcast in the United States but are no

1095,11," Ascertainability is typically a ""necessary prerequisite"" of a Rule 23(b)(3) class. Byrd v. Aaron's Inc., 784 F.3d 154, 162 (3d Cir. 
2015), as amended (Apr. 28, 2015). In this case, however, the Third Circuit has concluded that ascertainability is not a proper 
basis to deny certification. See ORDER of USCA, ECF No. 241. "
1097,12," In 2003, Congress amended Rule 23 to include subdivision 23(g), which provides a non-exhaustive list of factors for a court to 
consider when scrutinizing the adequacy of class counsel's representation. See Fed R. Civ. P. 23(g). The addition was meant to 
transfer the analysis of class counsel's representation from Rule 23(a)(4), where it had little textual support, to Rule 23(g). See 1 
William B. Rubenstein, Newberg on Class Actions § 3.80 (5th ed.). Rule 23(g) ""builds on"" the existing 23(a)(4) jurisprudence 
instead of ""introducing an entirely new element into the class certification process."" See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(g) advisory 
committee's notes (2003 amendments). Accordingly, the Third Circuit continues to apply the factors relied on prior to the addition 
of Rule 23(g). See In re Cmty. Bank of N. Va., 622 F.3d 275, 304-05 (3d Cir. 2010); In re Cmty. Bank of N. Va., 418 F.3d 277, 
307 (3d Cir. 2005). Class Counsel's representation of the Class satisfies both Rule 23(a)(4) and 23(g). "
1102,13," As discussed, the proposed forms of Notice and the Claim Form fail to properly describe the Settlement Class and the benefit 
amount each Class Member may be entitled to. The Settlement Agreement defines the Settlement Class as: All persons who: (i) resided in and subscribed to Premium Cable in California, Washington, or West Virginia during the Class Period, or (ii) subscribed to Premium Cable in any state in the United States during the Class Period and elected to opt out of 
Comcast's arbitration clause as reflected in Comcast's records; and paid Comcast a rental fee for a Set-Top Box at any time during the Class Period. Agreement § 3.1. The Settlement Agreement also provides that the amount of benefit that a Class Member may receive is 
determined by the length of time that the Class Member rented a Set-Top Box. Therefore, the Notice and Claim Form should 
explain that a Class Member who paid Comcast a rental fee for a Set-Top Box will receive credit: (1) for each month that s/he 
lived in any of the following states, California, Washington, or West Virginia, during the Class Period and subscribed to Premium 
Cable; and/or (2) for each month that s/he resided in any state in the United States during the Class Period and subscribed to 
Premium Cable, but elected to opt out of Comcast's arbitration clause. For instance, a person who subscribed to Premium Cable 
in California for 24 months during the Class Period and later subscribed to Premium Cable in Washington for an additional 12 
months during the Class Period would be entitled to receive a benefit amount in accordance with a Class Member who rented a 
Set-Top Box for 36 months. "
1130,1, The sealed version of The Cherokee Nation's First Amended Complaint is located at ECF No. 825. 
1132,2," Prudential standing is not derived from Article III and encompasses at least three broad principles: ""the general prohibition on a 
litigant's raising another person's legal rights, the rule barring adjudication of generalized grievances more appropriately 
addressed in the representative branches, and the requirement that a plaintiff's complaint fall within the zone of interests 
protected by the law invoked."" Lexmark Int'l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 134 S. Ct. 1377, 1386, 188 L. 
Ed. 2d 392 (2014) (quoting Elk Grove Unified Sch. Dist. v. Newdow, 542 U.S. 1, 12, 124 S. Ct. 2301, 159 L. Ed. 2d 98 (2004))."
1132,3," ""Parens patriae means literally 'parent of the country.'"" Alfred L. Snapp & Son, Inc. v. Puerto Rico, ex rel., Barez, 458 U.S. 592,

1133,4," Defendants also contend that Plaintiff fails to meet the Article III standing requirements to the extent that the Cherokee Nation 
purchased tuna in its proprietary capacity. (MTD 18-19.) Plaintiff's Opposition brief does not discuss proprietary standing. (See 
generally Opp'n.) At oral argument, Plaintiff cited paragraphs 339, 344, 354, 364, 369, and 376 of its amended Complaint, which 
address the purported harm to Cherokee businesses. (See ECF No. 1321, at 18.) These paragraphs state the following 
allegation: ""Plaintiff purchased Packaged Tuna within the State of California,"" (FAC ¶ 339), but change each state in each cause 
of action, e.g., ""Plaintiff purchased Packaged Tuna within the State of Kansas,"" (id. ¶ 344). These allegations provide no factual 
detail beyond such conclusory and vague statements. Furthermore, proprietary standing is appropriate when a state itself has 
proprietary interests, such as ""own[ing] land or participat[ing] in a business venture."" Snapp, 458 U.S. at 602. Plaintiff has not 
alleged any facts that, for example, the Cherokee Nation itself participated in any business venture harmed by Defendants' 
conduct. Therefore, Plaintiff's proprietary claims must fail. To the extent Plaintiff's vague allegations constitute proprietary causes 
of action the Court GRANTS IN PART Defendants' motion and DISMISSES WITHOUT PREJUDICE those claims."

] Article III and prudential standing are distinct concepts; prudential standing is a judicially crafted doctrine and does not 
derive from Article III. See Lexmark Int'l, 134 S. Ct. at 1386 (discussing prudential standing doctrine). Some courts have 
determined that the parens patriae standing requirements are prudential and not rooted in Article III. See Massachusetts v. EPA, 
549 U.S. 497, 540 n.1, 127 S. Ct. 1438, 167 L. Ed. 2d 248 (2007) (Roberts, C.J., dissenting); In re Elec. Books Antitrust Litig., 14 
F. Supp. 3d 525, 535 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (""[S]o long as [the States] have shown they have standing under Article III, the standing 
inquiry is at an end.""); New York v. Microsoft Corp., 209 F. Supp. 2d 132, 149 (D.D.C. 2002). On the other hand, Defendants direct the Court to dicta in Snapp where the Supreme Court stated, ""[f]ormulated so broadly, the 
concept [of quasi-sovereign interest] risks being too vague to survive the standing requirements of Art. III: A quasi sovereign 
interest must be sufficiently concrete to create an actual controversy between the State and the defendant."" 458 U.S. at 602. 
This might suggest that parens patriae is rooted in Article III, but the language does not clearly hold that parens patriae is a 
constitutional consideration. Given the Supreme Court's language and this Court's finding that Plaintiff is not bringing a claim 
under the statutory parens patriae section, 15 U.S.C. § 15c, it is sufficient to assume without deciding that parens patriae 
standing is prudential, not constitutional in nature."
1134,7," One issue mentioned in the parties' footnotes is whether the Nation's Attorney General falls within the definition of State 
attorney general for purposes of § 15c. The definition section, 15 U.S.C. § 15g, defines ""State attorney general"" as the ""chief 
legal officer of a State."" § 15g(1). The statute then defines ""State"" as a ""State, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of 
Puerto Rico, and any other territory or possession of the United States."" § 15g(2). The statute does not explicitly mention Indian 
nations. Plaintiff directs the Court to an unreported district court opinion for the proposition that the United States holds title to 
the land in trust on behalf of the Cherokee Nation and therefore the Nation should be considered a possession of the United 
States. (Opp'n 18 n.9 (citing Buzzard v. Okla. Tax Comm'n, 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22864, at *7-8 (N.D. Okla. Mar. 3, 1992)).) The Court is not persuaded that holding title to land translates to the Cherokee Nation being a possession under the federal 
antitrust statute. In Wilson v. Marchington, the Ninth Circuit discussed two Supreme Court decisions relating to whether Indian 
nations are territories or possession—the cases have diverging conclusions. See 127 F.3d 805 (9th Cir. 1997). In United States 
ex rel. Mackey v. Coxe, 59 U.S. (18 How.) 100, 103-04, 15 L. Ed. 299 (1855), the Supreme Court ""held the Cherokee nation was 
a territory as that term was used in a federal letters of administration statute."" Wilson, 127 F.3d at 808. By contrast, in New York 
ex rel. Kopel v. Bingham, 211 U.S. 468, 474-75, 29 S. Ct. 190, 53 L. Ed. 286 (1909), the Court cited with approval a district court 
opinion that held the Cherokee Nation was not a ""territory"" under the federal extradition statute. Wilson, 127 F.3d at 808. In 
Wilson, the Ninth Circuit declined to extend full faith and credit to tribal court decisions because the court construed the term 
""territory or possession of the United States"" in 28 U.S.C. § 1738 to not include Indian tribes. Id. at 809. At oral argument, 
Plaintiff maintained that Coxe is on point for the issue whether the Cherokee Nation is a territory or possession. (ECF No. 1321, "
1135,," at 14.) Coxe's applicability to the federal antitrust statute is far from certain, especially in light of the reasoning in Bingham and 
Wilson. The Court notes that should Plaintiff amend its complaint to rely on 15 U.S.C. § 15c it will likely need to more thoroughly discuss 
this issue. Because Plaintiff does not explicitly rely on § 15c, the Court will proceed with its analysis, assuming that Plaintiff could 
eventually demonstrate it has standing under § 15c."
1135,8," Plaintiff's Opposition brief cites to 12 CNCA § 13 and 51 CNCA § 105.B.14 as providing the requisite statutory standing. These 
citations to the Cherokee Nation Code do not appear to be correct. For example, 12 CNCA § 13 concerns the tolling of the 
limitations period for minors or incompetents. 51 CNCA § 105.B.14 provides the Attorney General with authorization to 
prosecute all civil and criminal actions against or within the jurisdiction of the Cherokee Nation. The Court believes title 51, 
section 105.B.2 is the appropriate citation, which authorizes the Attorney General to ""initiate or appear . . . in any action in which 
the interests of the Nation or the People of the Nation are at issue."" If Plaintiff cites Cherokee Nation Code going forward in this 
litigation, it should provide a copy of the relevant section, either by reference or judicial notice, for the Court. The Code is not 
available on the commercial reporters and the Cherokee Nation's website only contains a copy of the Code from 2015. "
1142,9," Plaintiff argues that Infineon does not address Kansas law and, presumably, is inapplicable. (Opp'n 34 n.21.) Simply because 
the Infineon court did not apply Kansas law does not also mean its reasoning is inapplicable. The fundamental issue at the core 
of all Plaintiff's state law claims is whether a foreign attorney general can bring a parens patriae suit under the law of a state 
other than the one he represents. Infineon dealt directly with that issue and the Court finds its reasoning sound. "
1153,1," The complaints name five related Merck entities, collectively referred to in this Report as Merck. "
1154,2," ECF numbers referenced in this Report and Recommendation correspond to case number 2:18cv23, FWK Holdings, LLC v. 
Merck & Co., Inc. et al. Merck filed substantially identical motions prior to consolidation of the direct purchaser actions in MDL 
No. 2836. See Mots., Case Nos. 2:18cv23 (ECF No. 92); 2:18cv39 (ECF No. 69); and 2:18cv71 (ECF No. 80). As stated in this 
court's August 15, 2018 order, the motions and responsive briefing are construed to apply to the forthcoming Direct Purchasers' 
consolidated complaint in Case No. 2:18md2836, presently due no later than September 13, 2018. Pretrial Order No. 4, at 2 n.1 
(ECF No. 141 at 2)."
1154,3," The MDL presently consists of 18 cases, including five cases transferred here from three other jurisdictions. "
1155,4," The operative agreements for two named Plaintiffs were signed in 2012. Earlier agreements covering the same subject matter 
did not contain arbitration clauses. The Plaintiffs have argued that the 2012 agreements do not have retroactive effect, as the 
events giving rise to their claims occurred almost entirely before 2012. In light of the recommendation set forth in this report, the 
undersigned does not reach the issue of whether the arbitration language is sufficiently broad to be given retroactive effect. See 
Wachovia Bank, Nat'l Ass'n v. Schmidt, 445 F.3d 762, 767 (4th Cir. 2006) (observing that arbitration clause encompassing 
claims relating to ""any aspect of the relationship between the parties"" is far broader than one encompassing those relating to the 
agreement itself). "
1157,5, The MAD Agreement provides that it is to be construed under Pennsylvania law. MAD Agmt. ¶ 7(Q) (ECF No. 96-1 at 8). 
1159,6," In his Italian Colors opinion for the majority, Justice Scalia characterized the effective vindication exception as a ""judge-made 
exception to the FAA."" 570 U.S. at 235. Though judges undoubtedly apply the exception, it should fairly be noted that it exists 
solely to vindicate those explicit policies which Congress saw fit to place beyond the reach of private contract. The Court itself 
has emphasized the importance of Congress's chosen remedies in the antitrust laws. See, e.g., Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co. of 
Cal., 405 U.S. 251, 262, 92 S. Ct. 885, 31 L. Ed. 2d 184 (1972). "
1160,7," Only one of the four agreements used the term ""extra-contractual damages,"" and the context in which it was used suggests it 
may have been interpreted to exclude only punitive, exemplary or mental-anguish damages. See PacifiCare, 538 U.S. at 407 
n.2. "
1161,8," In light of the above discussion, it is clear that the MAD Agreement must permit recovery of antitrust treble damages to be 
enforceable. It is perhaps telling, then, that counsel for Merck was reluctant to concede at argument that the Direct Purchasers 
would be entitled to treble damages if successful, regardless of the forum."
1161,9," PacifiCare uses the terms ""remedial"" and ""compensatory"" somewhat interchangeably, but never suggests that statutory treble 
damages are purely either. See 538 U.S. at 405-06. Suffice it to say that the Court's treatment of these terms permits a 
conclusion that treble damages could be entirely remedial but only partially compensatory, a conclusion that would still run 
aground of the MAD Agreement's arbitration provision. "
1162,10," See, e.g., 15 U.S.C. § 1117 (statutory and treble damages provisions of Lanham Act); 15 U.S.C. § 1681n (punitive damages 
provision of Fair Credit Reporting Act); 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c) (treble damages provision of RICO statute); 35 U.S.C. § 284 (treble

1174,1," The Court derives the factual background herein from Plaintiffs' Second Amended Complaint, which the Court presumes true 
for purposes of resolving Defendant's Motion to Dismiss. See Duke v. Cleland, 5 F.3d, 1399, 1402 (11th Cir. 1993). "
1175,2," Account holders can also deposit ""additional amounts during certain time periods."" (Second Am. Compl., Doc. 72 ¶ 37.)"
1175,3," It is unclear at this stage why GTL would classify an account as inactive at either 90 days or 180 days, but this is how Plaintiffs 
allege GTL applied its inactivity policy in the Second Amended Complaint."
1175,4," Plaintiffs' allegations are discussed in the present tense, as they allege that GTL's inactivity policy is ongoing. (Id. ¶¶ 45, 78, 
125.) "
1176,5," Plaintiffs argue that GTL ""makes much of its purported (unwritten) refund practice, even though the practice does not appear in 
the complaint."" (Pl. Resp., Doc. 91 at 9.) GTL argues that Plaintiffs rely on extra-pleading materials as their brief is ""littered with 
references to deposition testimony."" (Def. Reply, Doc. 101 at 5.) "
1177,6," In the Matter of Rates for Interstate Inmate Calling Services, 30 FCC Rcd. 12763, 12775-76, 12838-62 (November 5, 2015), 80 
Fed. Reg. 79136-01 (Dec. 18, 2015). "
1179,7," In addition to briefing this issue, Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Leave to Supplement the Record or, In the Alternative, to Amend 
Their Complaint [Doc. 105]. In part, Plaintiffs seek to include the deposition of GTL's corporate designee, Christopher McNitt, 
whose testimony shows the geographic journey a particular GTL call takes when an inmate places a call to an AdvancePay 
account holder — a journey involving data transmission across state lines, even if the recipient of the call is in the same state as 
the inmate. Defendant correctly argues in response that the ""end-to-end"" analysis under the FCA focuses on the beginning and end point of 
a call and does not divide communications at intermediate points of switching. Bell Atlantic Telephone Companies v. F.C.C., 206 
F.3d 1, 4 (D.C. Cir. 2000); McClure Tel. Co. v. AT&T Commc'ns of Ohio, Inc., 650 F. Supp. 2d 699, 705-06 (N.D. Ohio 2009). 
Thus, if a call both originates and ends in the same state — regardless of whether the communication traveled across state lines 
to connect those two end points — the call is considered to be intrastate. The Court therefore finds Plaintiffs' Motion to be 
extraneous and an incorrect application of the law with respect to Mr. McNitt's testimony about the interstate journey of GTL 
calls. However, Plaintiffs also request to amend their pleadings to add allegations that individual Plaintiffs opened GTL prepaid 
accounts ""with the intention to receive interstate calls."" (Pl. Mot. to Supp., Doc. 105 at 6.) As discussed in this section, the Court 
has decided to permit such amendment. The Court also notes that Plaintiffs represent some of them were unable to receive calls 
from inmates before GTL withdrew the funds from their prepaid accounts under the inactivity policy. Given this situation, the 
Court understands that individual Plaintiffs may not be able to allege that they actually received interstate calls but that they 
intended to receive interstate calls — based on their particular friend or relative being incarcerated in another state — before 
their accounts were emptied. Moreover, upon amending the pleadings, Plaintiffs should include particularized information as to 
the facility location of the incarcerated friend or relative. Accordingly, Plaintiffs' Motion to Supplement or Amend [Doc. 105] is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART. Additionally, as part of their Motion to Supplement or Amend, Plaintiffs asked the Court to lift the seal on excerpts of Mr. McNitt's 
deposition testimony referenced in the Motion. Defendant opposed lifting the seal, arguing that Mr. McNitt's testimony contained 
proprietary and sensitive information and trade secrets. Upon review of the deposition excerpts, the Court finds that Defendant 
has not sufficiently shown how the information in Mr. McNitt's deposition warrants protection from public view. Mr. McNitt simply 
discusses how GTL facilitates calls made from inmates (in public facilities) to individuals on the outside. Defendant has not 
shown how this information reveals trade secrets or particularly sensitive information that is not already known in the industry or 
accessible to the public. The Court therefore GRANTS Plaintiffs' Motion to Lift the Seal [Doc. 106] and DENIES Defendant's 
Motion to File a Response Under Seal [Doc. 110]. "
1180,8," The Court notes (as did Plaintiffs) the tension in GTL arguing, on one hand, that this case is not within the purview of the FCC 
because it does not involve interstate communication, and on the other hand, arguing that this case should be sent to the FCC 
under the primary jurisdiction doctrine. "
1181,9," Though GTL highlights the distinction between prisoner accounts and the accounts of their family members (at issue here), the 
condemned conduct is essentially the same. This distinction is not a meaningful one in light of the 2015 FCC Order's broad 
language. GTL also argues that Plaintiffs' citation to a passage in the FCC's Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking — which specifically 
raised GTL's inactivity or breakage practices — does not constitute a final rule prohibiting such practices. This may be so. 
However, the 2015 FCC Order does specifically identify the inactivity policy and characterize it as a ""problem"" that the Order is 
meant to resolve. (FCC Order, Doc. 91-1 ¶ 174 n. 627.) "
1182,10," Moreover, the potential for delay upon referral to the FCC is a real one, as the proceedings that led to the issuance of the 
2015 FCC Order lasted an incredible twelve years. (FCC Order, Doc. 91-1 ¶ 1.)"
1182,11," The fact pattern in Mexiport was slightly different, as the Eleventh Circuit had to determine whether the plaintiff's filing of an 
informal (as opposed to a formal) complaint with the FCC precluded the plaintiff from filing an action in district court. The 
Eleventh Circuit reasoned that the FCA does not distinguish between informal and formal complaints, and therefore the plaintiff's 
decision to file an informal complaint with the FCC still barred filing in district court. Despite the factual differences with the 
instant case, the Court finds the Mexiport decision to be instructive in its analysis of Section 207. Notably, the Eleventh Circuit in "
1183,," Mexiport never mentioned a ""prior determination"" requirement before the plaintiff could file in district court; the Eleventh Circuit 
simply stated that a plaintiff could file a complaint with the FCC or in district court."
1183,12," The case before the FCC began when an individual petitioned the agency for relief from ""exorbitant phone rates charged by 
inmate calling service (ICS) providers, so that she might afford telephone contact with her incarcerated grandson."" (FCC Order, 
Doc. 91-1 ¶ 1.) "
1184,13," GTL's argument regarding the filed-rate doctrine is relevant to all three of Plaintiffs' claims. Thus, the discussion herein — 
pertaining to the filed-rate doctrine — also applies to Plaintiffs' FCA claim should the Court find, upon amendment, that it 
survives."
1184,14," Additionally, it is unlawful for a carrier to ""employ or enforce any classifications, regulations, or practices affecting such 
charges, except as specified in such schedule."" 47 U.S.C. § 203(c). "
1186,15," While Florida Municipal did not involve the FCA, the filed-rate doctrine ""is applicable any time a regulated company has a rate 
for a service on file with the applicable regulatory agency."" Fla. Mun., 64 F.3d at 614. The analysis of the doctrine is therefore 
instructive. "
1194,1," Plaintiffs argue that the Ninth Circuit has held that the ""overall combination"" of Plaintiffs' trade dress is non-functional. (Dkt. 249 
at 20.) Plaintiffs refer to an order from the Ninth Circuit issued on September 15, 2017, which reversed and remanded the 
Court's order denying Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. (Dkt. 83.) Plaintiffs' argument is without merit, and overstates 
the Ninth Circuit's ruling. The Ninth Circuit did not hold that Plaintiffs' television show was nonfunctional, but rather clarified that 
Plaintiffs may have a protectable trade dress in the overall ""look and feel"" of the show, even if the individual elements of the 
show are functional. (Id. at 2.) "
1195,2," This deposition was taken in the prior case between the parties, which was filed in 2013. "
1197,3," Given the weakness of their trade secrets misappropriation claims, Plaintiffs resort to unsubstantiated character attacks on 
Defendant Tram Ho. (See Dkt. 249 at 25 [""Tram Ho is a proven pathological liar"" whose ""lies do not provide a basis for summary 
adjudication.""].) Plaintiffs cite to Tram Ho's purported ""admission"" of ""getting caught in lie after lie"" when, in her deposition, she 
acknowledged she might have made a mistake in entering information on her LinkedIn profile. (Dkt. 250 Ex. 170 at 65-68.) 
Plaintiffs then cite to Tram Ho's ""deposition in full"" as evidence of her ""lies."" (Dkt. 249 at 25.) The Court does not make credibility 
determinations, nor weigh conflicting evidence at the summary judgment stage. Eastman Kodak Co., 504 U.S. at 456. Further, 
such conclusory and speculative allegations in moving papers are insufficient to defeat summary judgment. See Thornhill, 594 
F.2d at 738. "
1200,4," Rule 12(d) requires that the parties have ""a reasonable opportunity to present all the material that is pertinent"" to the converted 
motion for summary judgment. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(d). The material pertinent to the converted motion for summary judgment on 
the breach of fiduciary duty and civil conspiracy claims is the material allegedly underlying Plaintiffs' misappropriation and 
interference claims. In light of the three rounds of briefing and hundreds of exhibits submitted on motions for summary judgment "
1201,," on those other claims, (Dkts. 174, 216, 249), Plaintiffs have been given ample opportunity to present evidence on the conduct 
underlying the breach of fiduciary duty and civil conspiracy claims."
1201,5," Plaintiffs also argue in their opposition to Defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings that Tram Ho was the ""Vice 
President of Marketing (an officer) at VBS."" (Dkt. 245 at17.) However, Plaintiffs never made that allegation in the operative TAC 
or exhibits attached thereto, and they fail to cite any other evidence in their opposition. Further, Tram Ho's employment contract 
explicitly characterizes Tram Ho as an ""employee,"" not a director, officer, or executive of VBS Television. (See TAC Ex. 13.) "
1202,6," Further, to the extent that Plaintiffs' breach of fiduciary duty claim turns on Plaintiffs' trade secrets misappropriation allegations, 
the claim is preempted by the California Uniform Trade Secrets Act. See First Advantage, 569 F. Supp. 2d at 936 (citing cases 
holding that common law claims based on misappropriation of trade secrets are preempted by the California Uniform Trade 
Secrets Act)."
1202,7," Both parties filed applications to file under seal certain documents in relation to Defendants' motion for summary judgment. 
(Dkts. 242, 248, 265.) The only reason cited by the parties to justify their applications to seal is the parties' protective order. As 
the Court has already explained in length, a mere citation to the protective order is not sufficient to warrant sealing documents 
from the public docket. (Dkt. 227 at 6-7.) The parties' applications are therefore DENIED. "
1208,1," The ""wellhead"" price is simply the price that gas producers charge for natural gas at the wellhead. Id. ¶ 72. Previously, the FPC 
imposed a ""cost-plus"" ratemaking system that allowed gas producers to factor the cost of natural gas production and a ""fair"" 
profit into the wellhead price. Id. The FPC determined what was considered ""fair."" Id. "
1211,2," Eversource owns NSTAR Gas Co. and Yankee Gas Co. and Avangrid owns Connecticut Natural Gas Co. and Southern

1211,3," As previously explained, the sale of natural gas is separate from the sale of transmission capacity. Id. ¶ 77. Transmission 
capacity is necessary to transport natural gas from seller to purchaser via a pipeline. "
1212,4," The class period began no later than August 1, 2013, continued through at least July 31, 2016 and ended or will end on the 
date the effects of the Defendants' anticompetitive conduct end. Id. ¶ 15. "
1215,5," In Town of Norwood, the First Circuit held that the filed rate doctrine applied with equal force to market-based wholesale 
electricity rates. Town of Norwood, 202 F.3d at 419 (explaining that ""FERC is still responsible for ensuring 'just and reasonable' 
rates and, to that end, wholesale power rates continue to be filed and subject to agency review, 16 U.S.C. § 824d""). As a result, 
the Court does not distinguish between market-based rates and rates formally filed with FERC for the purpose of determining 
whether the filed rate doctrine bars Plaintiffs' claims."
1215,6," In support of the argument that Plaintiffs only challenge conduct outside of FERC's jurisdiction, Plaintiffs rely on cases that are 
inapposite here, including F.E.R.C. v. Elec. Power Supply Ass'n,    U.S.   , 136 S. Ct. 760, 193 L. Ed. 2d 661 (2016), as revised 
(Jan. 28, 2016) (""E.P.S.A.""). See, e.g., D. 48 at 28. In E.P.S.A., the Supreme Court did not consider whether the filed rate 
doctrine bars claims challenging retail rates that would require courts to determine the reasonableness of wholesale rates filed 
with FERC. Rather, the court held that that FERC may regulate ""what takes place on the wholesale market,"" even if such 
regulations influence retail rates. E.P.S.A.,    U.S.   , 136 S. Ct. at 776. "
1216,7," Plaintiffs rely on Verizon Del., Inc. v. Covad Commc'ns Co., 377 F.3d 1081 (9th Cir. 2004) for the proposition that the filed rate 
doctrine does not bar claims that ""seek[] repayment in accord with the criteria in the filed rate[]"" doctrine. Verizon, 377 F.3d at 
1090; see D. 48 at 25. That case is inapplicable. There, the court determined that the plaintiff was entitled to recoup funds the 
defendant would have owed the plaintiff pursuant to filed rates but for defendant's alleged anticompetitive scheme to reduce its 
service costs. See Verizon, 377 F.3d at 1090 (stating that the plaintiff may ""recoup overpayments . . . to enforce the filed rates""). 
Where, as here, the plaintiff also sought damages in excess of filed rates, the Ninth Circuit concluded that the filed rate doctrine 
bars such recovery. Id. (explaining that the plaintiff may not, however collect overpayments that ""would be in addition to the filed 
rate"")."
1216,8," By contrast to the relief sought in Town of Norwood, ""Georgia and Square D Co. . . . concerned . . . possible price-fixing 
conspiracies that conceivably could have been enjoined without tampering with the tariffed rates themselves."" Town of Norwood, 
202 F.3d at 419-20. "
1218,9," Plaintiffs' reliance on City of Kirkwood v. Union Elec. Co., 671 F.2d 1173 (8th Cir. 1982) and Mishawaka v. Ind. & Mich. Elec. 
Co., 560 F.2d 1314 (7th Cir. 1977) to carve out an exception to the filed rate doctrine is similarly unpersuasive. See, e.g., D. 48 
at 30. The holdings of these cases turn on the analysis of price squeeze claims that are irrelevant here. Moreover, in the context 
of price squeeze claims, the First Circuit has declined to follow the reasoning in these cases. See Town of Concord, Mass. v. 
Boston Edison Co., 915 F.2d 17, 28-29 (1st Cir. 1990)."
1218,10," Plaintiffs also allege that if they cannot pursue their claims in this Court, they lack an adequate remedy. D. 59 at 50-51. HN8[ ] Although it is true that retail consumers do not have standing to file complaints with FERC, id., courts have consistently held that lack of a remedy does not create an exception to the filed rate doctrine. D. 44 at 26 (citing Maislin Indus., U.S., Inc. v. 
Primary Steel, Inc., 497 U.S. 116, 128, 110 S. Ct. 2759, 111 L. Ed. 2d 94 (1990) (explaining that ""[d]espite the harsh effects of 
the filed rate doctrine, we have consistently adhered to it"")); see Wah Chang, 507 F.3d at 1226-27 (observing that Plaintiff ""will 
not have a separate right of action for damages if it does not have this one, but lack of a damage remedy is not determinative""); 
Marcus v. AT&T Corp., 138 F.3d 46, 58 (2d Cir. 1998) (concluding that ""[a]pplication of the filed rate doctrine in any particular 
case is not determined by . . . the possibility of inequitable results"")). Nonetheless, even if Plaintiffs' claims were not barred by 
the filed rate doctrine, they would still fail for the reasons mentioned herein. "
1220,11," Plaintiffs' argument that Defendants' competitors in the natural gas transmission market have no incentive to sue Defendants 
does not require the Court to reach a different result. D. 48 at 42. Plaintiffs rely on a paragraph of their amended complaint 
regarding the wholesale and retail electricity markets in New England. D. 33 ¶ 164. In addition, Plaintiffs have not alleged that 
every competitor and customer in the natural gas transmission market benefited from Defendants' alleged anticompetitive 
conduct such that there is not a direct market actor with the incentive or capacity to sue Defendants, as required to satisfy the 
exceptional circumstances under which courts confer standing on a ""second-best plaintiff."" See SAS, 48 F.3d at 45. "
1224,12," Because Plaintiffs have not stated cognizable antitrust claims for monopolization, the Court does not reach Defendant 
Avangrid's argument that Plaintiffs' antitrust claims are grounded in a ""refusal to deal"" theory of antitrust liability that runs afoul of 
well-settled Supreme Court precedent. D. 43 at 25 (citing Pac. Bell Tel. Co. v. Linkline Commc'ns, Inc., 555 U.S. 438, 129 S. Ct. 
1109, 172 L. Ed. 2d 836 (2009) and Verizon Commc'ns v. Law Offices of Curtis V. Trinko, LLP, 540 U.S. 398, 124 S. Ct. 872, 
157 L. Ed. 2d 823 (2004)). "
1234,*," The Memorandum Opinion was issued under seal on September 5, 2018. This version contains redactions of confidential and 
competitively sensitive information. The Court has also made minor modifications, citing to publicly available, rather than 
confidential, information where appropriate. "
1235,1," The FTC's exhibits are identified by a ""PX"" followed by the exhibit number and a page number. The Defendants' exhibits use 
""RX"" followed by the exhibit and page numbers. "
1236,2," The Defendants ultimately elected to call only two witnesses, as they were running low on time under the parties' agreed-upon 
""chess clock"" system. See Hr'g Tr. 581:3-9. "
1238,3," Mr. Quinn's testimony was credible, and he gave candid responses even when they were not necessarily helpful to the 
Defendants. Though he has been on Tronox's board of directors for several years, Mr. Quinn only became Tronox's CEO in 
December 2017. Because he was not actively involved in the daily management of Tronox before then, his capacity to offer 
insights into the TiO2 industry was somewhat limited."
1238,4," During the evidentiary hearing, Mr. Christian provided testimony on Kronos's TiO2 production and on his views about the TiO2 
industry and competitive landscape. The Court credited his testimony; he gave thoughtful answers and did not appear to have a 
preferred outcome about the proposed transaction. He provided good perspectives and insights into an industry supplier's 
viewpoint, although his understanding of the customers' perspective was necessarily limited. "
1239,5," See, e.g., PX5000-043 (describing a Cristal email stating that ""[w]hat we really would like to avoid is to accept that T595 [a 
chloride pigment] could be compared to a low sulphate [sic] quality product.""); PX9121 at 007 (Chemours 2017 10-K) (""Our 
portfolio of premium performance TiO2 pigment grades provides end-users with benefits beyond opacity, such as longer-lasting 
performance, brighter colors, and the brilliant whites achievable only through chloride-manufactured pigment."")."
1239,6," During the evidentiary hearing, counsel for Tronox advised that the Court should be ""wary of self-serving statements by 
customers."" Hr'g Tr. 64:10-16. When Dr. Malichky made statements revealing self-serving interests, the Court weighed his 
assertions in that context. Generally, the Court credited Dr. Malichky's statements if they appeared to track the perspectives 
offered by other TiO2 consumers and industry participants, as evidenced by documents in the record."
1239,7," See also PX8001-002 (statement from [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] noting that the firm ""only uses chloride grade 
titanium dioxide. [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT]""); PX5000-045 (collecting similar statements from customers like [TEXT 
REDACTED BY THE COURT] and [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT]). "
1240,8," Dr. Hill has a doctorate in economics from Johns Hopkins University, and serves as a partner at Bates White, an economic 
consulting firm. As one of the FTC's three witnesses during the evidentiary hearing, Dr. Hill provided his own analysis and 
opinions. He also served as a summary witness of sorts, enabling the Commission to highlight relevant aspects of the extensive 
administrative record. The Court found his testimony and report to be credible. But his models and the conclusions they suggest 
are susceptible to some valid critiques. So while the Court found them ultimately consistent with the other evidence presented, 
his analysis was not dispositive on either the relevant market or the likelihood that the merger will increase market concentration."
1240,9," Dr. Shehadeh has a PhD in economics from Cornell and is a managing director at NERA, an economic consulting firm. He too 
both summarized his modeling and synthesized his side's key evidence during the evidentiary hearing. The Court found Dr. 
Shehadeh's testimony and analysis to be entitled to some weight but ultimately unconvincing on several key points."
1240,10," Reflecting their limitations as an approach to defining markets, Dr. Jonathan Baker, a former director of the FTC's Bureau of 
Economics and Chief Economist at the Federal Communications Commission concluded that ""price correlation tests contain little 
or no information relevant to the issue of antitrust market definition."" Jonathan B. Baker, Why Price Correlations Do Not Define 
Antitrust Markets 7, Fed. Trade Comm'n Working Paper No. 149 (1987). See also Gregory J. Werden and Luke Froeb, 
Correlation, Causality, and All that Jazz: The Inherent Shortcomings of Price Tests for Antitrust Market Delineation, 8 Rev. of 
Indus. Org. 329, 332-338 (1993) (highlighting some problems with using price correlation to define antitrust markets). "
1241,11, The Defendants have not suggested that the relevant market should be any narrower than the FTC's proposal. 
1246,12," The Commission alleges a history of overt collusion in the TiO2 industry, pointing to recent price-fixing allegations and 
litigation. See Valspar Corp. v. E.I. Du Pont De Nemours and Co., 873 F.3d 185 (3d Cir. 2017); In re Titanium Dioxide Antitrust 
Litig., 959 F. Supp. 2d 799 (D. Md. 2013); Pl.'s Mem. in Supp. of Pl.'s Mot. for Prelim. Inj. 3, ECF. No. 6 (""the TiO2 industry in 
North America has a long history of price-fixing litigation and subsequent court decisions outline pervasive anticompetitive 
conduct.""). The Defendants vigorously contest these assertions. See Defs.' Redacted Opp. to Prelim. Inj. 28-29. That said, the 
Court need not decide the merits of these claims, as the proposed merger will increase the likelihood of collective output 
withholding without explicit agreements or attempted price-fixing. "

1266,1," Initially, Defendants also sought dismissal of opt-out indirect purchaser plaintiffs' complaint. However, being that both opt-out 
plaintiffs have since voluntarily dismissed their actions, these arguments are not considered. See Docket No. 1 l-cv-5590 (ECF 
Nos. 148, 158). "
1267,2, 21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(5)(B)(iv).
1267,3," Walker Process Equipment, Inc. v. Food Machinery & Chemical Corp., 382 U.S. 172, 86 S. Ct. 347, 15 L. Ed. 2d 247 (1965)."
1267,4," According to the Complaint, ""[t]he patent would have expired much earlier than 2008, but Wyeth received a significant 
extension to reflect the time it took the FDA to approve its NDA for Effexor."" (Id.). "
1268,5," A utility patent application seeks to protect a new, useful, or nonobvious process or composition and a provisional application 
only requires a brief written description of the subject matter that is sought to be protected. Essentially, a provisional application 
""allows an inventor to establish a date of invention one full year before the inventor actually submits evidence of [the] invention's 
patentability."" (Id. at ¶ 108). "
1276,6," Defendants also make a similar argument for Plaintiff's Illinois consumer protection claims; however, being that the Illinois 
Consumer Fraud & Deceptive Business Practice Act does not explicitly bar class actions, the Court finds it more appropriate to 
consider the substantive arguments Defendants present later. "
1277,7," From the Court's perspective, in agreement with Justice Stevens, the state statutes at issue focus on various forms of 
deceptive practices. Rule 23 is more generic and applies to all class actions. As such, the narrower and more focused approach 
of the state should apply. "
1278,8," Both Alabama and Georgia's consumer protection statutes contain similar language to Tennessee, which prohibit the use of 
class actions to enforce the rights created therein. Ala. Code Ann. § 8-19-10(f) (""A consumer or other person bringing an action 
under this chapter may not bring an action on behalf of a class""); Ga. Code Ann. § 10-1-399(a) (""Any person who suffers injury 
or damages . . . as a result of consumer acts or practices in violation of this part . . . may bring an action individually, but not in a 
representative capacity""). "
1282,9," Because the Court has already dismissed EPPs' claims under Massachusetts, Tennessee and West Virginia's consumer 
protection statutes, it does not address the remaining arguments pertaining to these states."
1282,10," Moreover, it should be noted that, at the pleading stage it is difficult to determine whether Plaintiff's claims under California law 
are even based on fraudulent conduct; as such, the Court also finds Defendants' motion to be premature. "
1295,1," Representations cited in paragraph 18 and 19 in the Complaint are not actionable as they are all after Beyer's dates of 
purchase. See Compl. ¶¶ 18-19. Beyer's citation of these materials in his opposition to Symantec's motion to dismiss are thus 
irrelevant. See Docket No. 22, at 16-17. "
1299,2," This conclusion is without prejudice to future motions, e.g., for summary judgment or adjudication which take into accord the 
factual record of, inter alia, the frequency of harm suffered as a result of the defects."
1299,3," Again, this ruling is without prejudice to any future motions or adjudication should the factual record establish Plaintiff cannot 
meet his burden of proving, e.g., that he saw and read the product statement. "
1301,4," Symantec also argues that the cases Beyer cites are inapposite because they pertain to conventional purchases not conducted 
online. See Docket No 24 (Reply) at 11. However, California case law supports Beyer's position that § 2401(2)(a) applies to 
online purchases. See Cal. State Elecs. Ass'n v. Zeos Int'l Ltd., 49 Cal. Rptr. 2d 127, 41 Cal. App. 4th 1270, 1275-77 (1996); see 
also In re Seagate Tech. LLC Litig., No. 16-cv-0523-JCS, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 137270, 2017 WL 3670779, at *16 (N.D. Cal. 
Aug. 25, 2017)."
1301,5," Symantec also argues that the unfairness claim should fail, because its factual basis overlaps entirely with the fraudulent and 
unlawful claims, which fail. Because the fraudulent and unlawful claims survive, this argument in inapposite. "
1304,1," Separate from Apricus. Ferring submits a motion to dismiss and motion to strike, but ""[t]o avoid duplicative briefing . 
incorporates by reference"" Apricus's memoranda of law in support of its motions. Ferr. Mem. at 1. ECF No. 61. The Court, 
therefore, adjudicates these motions together. "
1306,2," To the extent the complaint can be read to allege injuries in France, those injuries do not give rise to an antitrust injury for the 
reasons set forth in Part II.A.1.c of this opinion. See, e.g., Biocad, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 162398, 2017 WL 4402564, at *4 n.5; 
Turicentro, S.A. v. Am. Airlines Inc., 303 F.3d 293, 307 (3d Cir. 2002) (""Plaintiffs' injuries occurred exclusively in foreign markets. 
They are not of the type Congress intended to prevent through . . . the Sherman Act.""). It does not matter that—as Plaintiffs 
argue—""the parties have contractually agreed that the License Agreement is to be governed by and construed in accordance 
with the laws of New York, including the Sherman Act, regardless of where the harm occurs."" Pls. Opp. at 9 (emphasis in 
original). ""The subject matter jurisdiction of the federal district courts is limited,"" DiNapoli v. DiNapoli, No. 95 Civ. 7872, 1995 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13522, 1995 WL 555740, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 19, 1995), and ""[a] forum selection clause . . . is not sufficient to 
confer subject matter jurisdiction on this Court."" Velasquez v. Parmalat SpA, No. 99 Civ. 9038, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3376, 
2000 WL 294840, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 21, 2000); see also Cable Television Ass'n v. Finneran, 954 F.2d 91, 94 (2d Cir. 1992) 
(""[P]arties may not confer subject matter jurisdiction on the court by consent.""). "
1307,3," To the extent that Plaintiffs' brief in opposition attempts to defend the complaint's market definition, it sets forth factual 
representations beyond the four corners of the complaint. See Pls. Opp. at 12 n.4 (explaining that the market for Vitaros is 
distinct because ""Vitaros is prescribed by doctors only as a second-line treatment, whereas Cialis® and Viagra® are first-line 
drugs,"" and unlike these two products, ""Vitaros has virtually no delay and does not require sexual stimulation""). ""[A] party is not 
entitled to amend its complaint through statements made in motion papers."" Wright v. Ernst & Young LLP, 152 F.3d 169, 178 (2d 
Cir. 1998). The Court, therefore, does not consider these assertions because ""[n]ew facts and allegations, first raised in a 
Plaintiff's opposition papers, may not be considered in deciding a motion to dismiss."" Univ. Trading & Inv. Co., Inc. v. 
Tymoshenko, No. 11 Civ. 7877, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 176214, 2012 WL 6186471, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 12, 2012). "
1309,4," Indeed, Plaintiffs allege no facts suggesting any impact on U.S. markets, stating only that: (1) Plaintiffs are ""ready to sell 
generic erectile dysfunction products in France""; (2) Plaintiffs have the ""future ability to directly or indirectly sell same in the 
United States""; and (3) ""[r]estriction of potential sellers of products in such markets has the effect of restricting supply and 
distribution, ultimately resulting in higher end prices for consumers."" Am. Compl. ¶¶ 60, 63."
1309,5," Plaintiffs' failure to address this argument in their opposition brief, moreover, provides an independent basis to dismiss this 
claim. Pls. Opp. at 8-15. See M.M. ex rel. J.M. v. New York City Dep't of Educ., No. 09 Civ. 5236, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 75127, 
2010 WL 2985477, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. July 27, 2010) (holding that plaintiffs' failure to respond to defendant's arguments constitutes 
an abandonment because ""[b]y standing mute in the face of the [defendant's] jurisdictional challenge, Plaintiffs effectively 
concede that they cannot carry their burden and that the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the claims against 
[defendant]""). "
1316,1, Uber does not argue that Flywheel's definition of the geographic market is deficient.
1316,2," This element of an antitrust claim need not be pled with specificity. See Cost Mgmt. Servs., Inc. v. Washington Nat. Gas Co., 
99 F.3d 937, 950 (9th Cir. 1996) (complaint ""need only allege sufficient facts from which the court can discern the elements of an 
injury resulting from an act forbidden by the antitrust laws"") (citation and quotation omitted)."
1316,3, Flywheel also alleges that Uber controls approximately seventy percent of this market. (Id. ¶ 16.) 
1317,4," According to the Complaint, UberX and UberXL exist in the marketplace as direct competitors to taxis—not as direct 
competitors to commercially licensed transportation services. (Id. ¶¶ 22, 23, 37, 38, 50, 59, 60.)"
1317,5," The Court disagrees with Uber's argument that the allegations in the Complaint are contradictory. (See Complaint ¶ 17.) The 
Complaint only describes three broad categories of private, for-hire transportation in San Francisco in the pre-2012 economy. 
The Complaint does not suggest that these three ""types"" of transportation were fungible or ""reasonably interchangeable."" 
Rather, the Complaint suggests that the three ""types"" of transportation served distinct market needs. (See id. ¶¶ 18-19.)"
1317,6," The cases Uber cites in order to argue these methods of transportation are ""interchangeable"" are distinguishable. Two of these 
cases occur in the context of constitutional challenges to municipal ordinances, not in the context of analyzing a ""relevant 
market"" under the Sherman Act. See Ill. Transp. Trade Assn. v. City of Chicago, 839 F.3d 594 (7th Cir. 2016); Joe Sanfelippo 
Cabs, Inc. v. City of Milwaukee, 839 F.3d 613 (7th Cir. 2016). In a third case, Lala v. Frampton, No. 07-cv-2144-MSK-CBS, 2008 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 66003, 2008 WL 4059874, at *4 (D. Colo. Aug. 28, 2008), the plaintiff provided only a perfunctory and 
""conclusory"" market definition, and the complaint ""did not plead facts that would explain why [alternate] services should not be 
considered part of the relevant market."" Those deficits are not present here. "
1318,7," In order to establish a submarket, a plaintiff must be able to show that the submarket is economically distinct from the general 
product market. Newcal Indus., 513 F.3d at 1045. ""[I]ndustry or public recognition of the submarket as a separate economic 
entity, the product's peculiar characteristics and uses, unique production facilities, distinct customers, distinct prices, sensitivity 
to price changes, and specialized vendors"" all are ""practical indicia"" of an economically distinct submarket. Brown Shoe, 370 
U.S. at 325."
1318,8," According to the Complaint, Uber was founded in 2009 with $200,000 in ""initial seed money,"" but started UberX and UberXL in 
2012 and 2014, respectively. (Complaint ¶ 33.)"
1318,9," Flywheel cites to Hunt-Wesson Foods, Inc. v. Ragu Foods, Inc., 627 F.2d 919 (9th Cir. 1980) for the proposition that an 
allegation of a specific market share is sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss. There, the Ninth Circuit stated that it could not "
1319,," say that allegations of a sixty-five percent market share (that was increasing) could not ""under any market conditions"" provide a 
basis for inferring the requisite market power. Id. at 925. This statement, of course, is not the same as declaring that an 
allegation of a certain threshold of market share is sufficient to plead monopolization. Hunt-Wesson, moreover, makes no 
mention of potential barriers to entry or the importance of such analysis, which innumerable, more recent cases have suggested 
is crucial. For these reasons, Hunt-Wesson is distinguishable."
1319,10," Given venture capital's known proclivity for funding subsequent iterations of a successful business model, Uber's market 
success (as alleged in the Complaint) very likely makes it easier, not harder, for newcomers to the relevant product market to 
procure capital backing. "
1320,11," The Court is not persuaded that Flywheel's surge pricing allegations undermine or contradict its allegations regarding below-
cost pricing. Drawing all reasonable inferences from the Complaint, for example, it is reasonable to conclude that incidents of 
surge pricing occurred less frequently than incidents of below-cost pricing and in such margins and multiples as to only partially 
offset below-cost pricing. As such, it is entirely possible that the additional income generated by surge pricing was insufficient to 
overtake the losses incurred by the below-cost pricing. "
1321,12," Flywheel does not provide direct quotes of the statements in their entirety, but Uber has pointed to no case that stands for the 
proposition that Flywheel must do so."
1321,13," Flywheel is not required, even under a heightened pleading standard, to present the ""context"" of the purportedly misleading 
statements. The cases Uber cites for its argument are distinguishable. Southland Sod Farms v. Stover Seed Co. stands for the 
proposition that that the context of a statement may transform a statement from true or not ""literally false"" to false ""by necessary 
implication."" 108 F.3d 1134, 1137-39 (9th Cir. 1997). Meanwhile, XYZ Two Way Radio Service, Inc. v. Uber Techs., Inc. 
suggests that additional contextual information is necessary when such information could redeem the statements in the 
complaint. 214 F. Supp. 3d 179, 184 (E.D.N.Y. 2016). It is unclear to the Court, drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the "
1322,," Complaint, that additional contextual information contained elsewhere on the website would or could redeem the statements 
featured in the Complaint. "
1324,14," At this juncture, the Court declines to address whether Flywheel has sufficiently alleged a nexus between the wrongful conduct 
alleged in the Sherman Act or UPA claims as each have been substantively dismissed."
1324,15," In its opposition, Flywheel argues that each of these transgressions results in a ""less regulated"" driver experience, which 
makes Uber more attractive than Flywheel to drivers. This allegation, however, does not appear in the Complaint, and the Court 
is unable to infer as much from the allegations themselves. Further, many of the unlawful activities of which Uber stands 
accused, seem demonstrably unattractive to drivers: forcing them to carry their own insurance and refusing to allow drivers to 
register their vehicles as commercial vehicles, to name but two examples."
1324,16," The cases Uber cites do not stand for the proposition that Flywheel is required to allege the specific identities of individual 
drivers. Indeed, based on the Complaint, listing each individual driver of the ""thousands"" who departed Flywheel for Uber would 
be prohibitive. (See, e.g., Complaint ¶ 80.) "
1330,1," I noted that the statute of limitations for medical malpractice is three years after the date of the injury or one year after the 
plaintiff discovers, or using reasonable diligence should have discovered, the injury. Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. § 340.5."
1330,2," I dismissed the breach of contract claim against CMS, as being within the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States Court of 
Federal Claims under the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1491(a)(1). "
1332,3," Hansen does not dispute this other than saying that he had Dr. Levy personally served at Satellite Dialysis in Greenbrae and 
""served"" Satellite Healthcare via their agent for service of process. Dkt. No. 111. But the evidence Hansen submits shows that 
the original complaint was served on Satellite/Del Bene by certified mail and by personal service on Drs. Levy, Estilo and Marin 
Nephrology. Dkt. No. 112 at ECF pgs. 9-13. "
1333,4," To the extent there is any ambiguity over whether Hansen intends to sue Satellite Dialysis, located in Greenbrae, California or 
the apparent corporate parent, Satellite Healthcare, Inc., any such ambiguity shall be resolved in Hansen's favor. ""Satellite 
Dialysis"" is listed in the TAC, has specially appeared in this action through counsel, and because Satellite Dialysis does not 
argue it is not the correct defendant (if properly served), I will consider Satellite Dialysis the appropriate defendant for Hansen's 
claims."
1333,5," MGH contends that these allegations do not amount to specific allegations regarding a breach of the standard of care by any 
medical provider. MGH Mot. at 12. But Hansen alleges that on April 17, 2017 and September 4, 2017, healthcare providers at 
MGH turned him away without allowing him to receive dialysis, resulting in health complications and specific harms. Similarly, 
the allegations that Dr. Levy allegedly decides when Hansen receives dialysis and restricts his dialysis at MGH, construed 
broadly, also support a malpractice claim against Dr. Levy."
1333,6," This case was filed in Marin County Superior Court on April 4, 2017. Dkt. No. 1 (Notice of Removal). "
1335,7," As to CMS, Hansen alleges only that CMS has imposed regulations that encourage hospitals to fail to adequately treat 
patients. Id. ¶¶ 49, 50. "
1336,8," The alleged fact that defendants ""make more money"" by providing dialysis rather than securing transplants for patients cannot, 
on its face and standing alone, support a discrimination or civil rights claim. TAC ¶¶ 54, 56. "
1337,9," In his TAC, Hansen realleges his breach of contract claim against CMS. This cause of action was dismissed with prejudice in 
the December Order. "
1338,10," In general: ""To establish a section 1 violation under the Sherman Act, a plaintiff must demonstrate three elements: (1) an 
agreement, conspiracy, or combination among two or more persons or distinct business entities; (2) which is intended to harm or 
unreasonably restrain competition; and (3) which actually causes injury to competition, beyond the impact on the claimant, within 
a field of commerce in which the claimant is engaged (i.e., 'antitrust injury')."" McGlinchy v. Shell Chem. Co., 845 F.2d 802, 811 
(9th Cir. 1988). ""To establish a section 2 violation for an attempt to monopolize, a plaintiff must demonstrate four elements: (1) 
specific intent to control prices or destroy competition; (2) predatory or anti-competitive conduct directed toward accomplishing 
that purpose; (3) a dangerous probability of success; and (4) causal antitrust injury."" Id."
1338,11," I also note that Hansen fails to allege facts to plausibly support that defendants had an agreement to monopolize the dialysis 
market (or kidney transplant market) in Marin County or more broadly. Other than the specific allegations that he was 
blackballed by Dr. Levy from receiving dialysis (which cannot support antitrust injury and are contradicted by Hansen's own 
allegations that others can receive dialysis at Kaiser facilities, TAC ¶ 69) his other allegations (that defendants conspired to 
require more expensive dialysis instead of transplants for patients) are far too general to plausibly support this claim."
1338,12," As noted, I am not deciding at this time whether Hansen has adequately alleged or can allege his ADA/civil rights claim 
against Dr. Levy or MGH, and instead allowing those defendants to challenge that claim in a further motion to dismiss. "
1339,13, The UCL claim against CMS was dismissed with prejudice in the December Order. 
1341,1," The Court refers to Plaintiffs Northshore and Meyer collectively as ""Northshore"" in this decision. "

1350,5," The Court also questions the viability of arguing for an expansive reading of Reed v. Town of Gilbert. See NLRB v. International 
Association of Bridge, Structural, Ornamental and Reinforcing Ironworkers Union, Local 433, 891 F.3d 1182 (9th Cir. 2018). "
1356,1," Standard Setting Organizations ""establish technical specifications to ensure that products from different manufacturers are 
compatible with each other."" Microsoft Corp. v. Motorola, Inc., 696 F.3d 872, 875 (9th Cir. 2012)(""Microsoft II"")(citing Mark A. 
Lemley, Intellectual Property Rights and Standard—Setting Organizations, 90 Calif. L.Rev. 1889 (2002)). Many courts have 
expounded on the benefits of standards in various industries. See, e.g., Microsoft Corp. v. Motorola, Inc., 795 F.3d 1024, 1030 
(9th Cir. 2015)(""Microsoft IV""); Apple, Inc. v. Motorola Mobility, Inc., 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 72745, 2011 WL 7324582, at *1 
(W.D. Wis. June 7, 2011). "
1357,2," In accordance with the order, the parties narrowed their asserted patents, claims, and products on September 11, 2017 (Dkt. 
Nos. 172, 173), March 16, 2018 (Dkt. Nos. 255, 256), and June 26, 2018 (Dkt. Nos. 318-3, 319). At present, Huawei has 
narrowed its asserted claims to the following: U.S. Patent 8,416,892, claims 1, 10; U.S. Patent 8,644,239, claims 7, 18; U.S. 
Patent 8,885,587, claims 3, 9; and U.S. Patent 8,724,613, claims 1, 5 (Dkt. No. 318-3[redacted]). And Samsung has narrowed 
its claims to the following: U.S. Patent No. RE44,105, claims 28, 29, and 32; U.S. Patent No. 8,509,350, claim 1; U.S. Patent No. 
8,619,726, claims 11 and 13; U.S. Patent No. 8,761,130, claims 13 and 16; and U.S. Patent No. 9,288,825, claims 1 and 4 (Dkt. 
No. 319)."
1357,3," On March 1, 2018, I granted Huawei's motion for clarification or reconsideration for one of the constructions, the term ""first P-
temporary Mobile Station Identity (P-TMSI) in an access message,"" appearing in Huawei's '166 Patent, and assigned it its plain 
and ordinary meaning. Order on Huawei's Mot. for Clarification, or in the alternative, Reconsideration of Claim Construction 
Order (Dkt. No. 247)."
1357,4," Since Samsung had selected these claims as part of its case narrowing process, it was permitted to amend its election of 
asserted claims and patents. Order Regarding Substitution of Patent and Claims (Dkt. No. 268); Samsung's Am. Case 
Narrowing St. (Dkt. No. 275). "
1361,5," In the Joint Claim Construction and Prehearing Statement, the parties collectively identified a total of 102 terms for the 20 
asserted patents that required construction (Dkt. No. 124). See Terms from Huawei's Patents (Joint St., Ex. B; Dkt. No. 124-2); 
Terms from Samsung's Patent (Joint St., Ex. C, Dkt. No. 124-3). "
1363,6," The separate, but related, question of whether these arguments are more suitable for motions in limine was not presented by 
the parties and is not addressed here."
1363,7," In Samsung's declaration in support of sealing portions of Huawei's motion for summary judgment and exhibits thereto, it noted 
that it does not maintain a claim of confidentiality over the Hausman Report or his deposition testimony, but it did not file an 
unredacted version of the Report. See Malmberg Decl. ISO Huawei's Admin. Mot. to File Under Seal Portions of Huawei's 
Summ. J. and Daubert Mots. ¶¶ 5, 7, 9 (Dkt. No. 344)."
1363,8," To support this position, Huawei also cites to Huawei executive Jason Ding's statement regarding the injunction actions: Perhaps judges are quite reluctant to hear injunction cases because of its staggering impact on the market. . . Even if 
injunction order were to be enforced, does Huawei really want to kick Samsung out of China? Is it possible? Of course not. . 
. . At the [**38]  end of the day, your purpose is to get the royalties in return, while using legal action as a bargaining 
chip. Dkt. No. 235-7; see also Song Dep. at 23:10-19 (Stake Decl. ¶ 6; id., Ex. 5). "
1364,9," As discussed below, the irrelevance of the doctrine is clear; Huawei admits that it is a monopolist in the market because ETSI 
has accepted its declared SEPs. "
1365,10," It is worth noting that the order addressed a motion to dismiss, not a motion for summary judgment, as I am presented with 
here. See Qualcomm, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98632, 2017 WL 2774406, at *22 (""FTC's allegations are sufficient, at this stage of 
the proceedings, to allege that Qualcomm's refusal to deal is motivated by 'anticompetitive malice.'""). "
1366,11," It is also worth noting that Samsung has not presented (and Huawei is not aware of) any cases in which a plaintiff has 
prevailed at trial asserting an antitrust claim premised on Broadcom. "
1367,12," The report and recommendation was subsequently adopted by the district court. 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 39950, 2017 WL 
1055958 (D. Del. Mar. 20, 2017). "
1368,13," Samsung footnotes that the antitrust injury is ""less demanding"" when an antitrust claimant seeks injunctive relief. See Opp'n at 
9 n.9 (citing Palmyra Park Hosp. Inc. v. Phoebe Putney Mem'l Hosp., 604 F.3d 1291, 1299 (11th Cir. 2010)). The Palmyra 
court noted that ""[t]he antitrust standing injury under § 16 of the Clayton Act [allowing injunctive relief] is less demanding than 
under § 4 [allowing recovery for treble damages]."" 604 F.3d at 1299. It explained that ""a plaintiff seeking relief under § 16 must 
still allege an antitrust injury, just as the plaintiff would under § 4[,]"" but in the context of injunctive relief ""we are less concerned 
about whether the party would be the most efficient enforcer[.]"" Id. at 1299-1300. The court concluded that ""[t]he takeaway ... is 
that 'if a plaintiff has standing to bring an antitrust action under section 4, he will also have standing under section 16.'"" Id. at 
1300. Palmyra, therefore, does not help Samsung here. "
1369,14," A claim for attempted monopolization requires ""proof of a dangerous probability that they would monopolize a particular 
market and specific intent to monopolize."" Spectrum Sports, Inc. v. McQuillan, 506 U.S. 447, 459, 113 S. Ct. 884, 122 L. Ed. 2d 
247 (1993). Given the explicit requirement related to intent, an attempted monopolization claim would fare no better."
1369,15," Given this conclusion, I need not determine whether the act of state doctrine bars Samsung's antitrust claim. "
1370,16," Huawei points out that Samsung proposed ""no construction necessary"" for each of the terms at issue for the '130, '105, and 
'825 patents. See Joint Claim Construction St. (Dkt. No. 124-3). "
1371,17," During the hearing, Samsung explained this interpretation that the word ""remaining"" refers to ""where"" the data information is 
mapped, not ""when"" it is mapped. "
1372,18," As discussed below, it also moves to strike Huawei's argument because it argues that it was not timely disclosed. See 
discussion infra VII. "
1373,19," In the Joint Claim Construction Statement, Huawei proposed its preferred construction, but Samsung contended that the term 
needed no construction. Dkt. No. 124-3 at 58. "
1375,20," This ruling is not inconsistent with any rulings on Samsung's motion to exclude portions of Huawei's experts' reports because 
""the outcome depends upon how the expert expresses his opinion."" Fid. Nat. Fin., Inc. v. Nat'l Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburg, 
PA, No. 09-CV-140-GPCKSC, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 47041, 2014 WL 1286392, at *8 (S.D. Cal. Mar. 28, 2014). "
1376,21," To the extent that any of these opinions are based on incorrect legal assumptions or propose views that diverge from the 
actual law, as Huawei asserts, those opinions may be excluded via motions in [**76]  limine. See Villalpando v. Exel Direct Inc., 
161 F. Supp. 3d 873, 895 (N.D. Cal. 2016)(addressing motions in limine and noting that ""an expert's reliance on incorrect legal 
assumptions would warrant exclusion[.]"")."
1376,22," Samsung moves to strike a number of Huawei's noninfringement theories and noninfringement alternatives on the basis that 
they were not timely disclosed, and some of those arguments are implicated here. As discussed below, see discussion infra 
section VII, I am denying that motion. "
1378,23," This conclusion is confirmed by the specification, which notes that the invention discloses ""[a] method for transmitting service 
[that] includes: selecting a part or all of radio frames in one time unit as specific radio frames; selecting a part of all of subframes 
in the specific radio frames as specific subframes for sending a specific service; sending the service according to the above time 
division multiplexing mode; and sending position information of the specific radio frames and/or position information of the 
specific subframes."" '613 Patent at 2:63-3:3."
1378,24," The ""exceed the bounds"" language of Apple, see 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22938, 2014 WL 660857, at *6, may cause confusion 
because one could interpret a more narrow interpretation as falling within the bounds of plain and ordinary, rather than 
""exceed[ing]"" them. But, as explained, an improperly narrow construction technically falling within the bounds of a plain and 
ordinary meaning would still inappropriately delve too deep into claim construction. "
1380,25," This conclusion is reinforced by the conditional language in Dr. Lyon's report. See Lyon Report ¶ 190 (""[T]o the extent there is 
a determination that the asserted claims require multiple actors to infringe the claims, Dr. Akl and Huawei have not set forth 
evidence to show that Samsung had any control over the third party network entities, and therefore, the Accused Products would 
not infringe the asserted claims.""). "
1381,26," In Reply, Huawei argues that ""at least one of' includes both, as well as either."" Reply at 9. So, in its estimation, since ""[t]he 
claim recites only one IFT operation,"" both sets must be available at the same time. Id. This argument does not alter the 
conclusion that Huawei's theory depends on a limited interpretation of the claims. "
1383,27," The same result follows even if the dispute is framed around the ""allocated by the system"" language, as Samsung contends. 
As Huawei notes, ""[t]he system could easily allocate the 'group number k' and then send data allowing the mobile to calculate it."" 
Reply at 5. "
1384,28," In Reply, it also highlights dependent claim 8, which provides ""[t]he method of claim 6, wherein n is a value from the group of 
values consisting of: one... ."" '239 patent at 25:27-28. "
1386,29," Samsung has moved to strike assertions based on a DOE theory of infringement because Huawei did not disclose it in its 
Infringement Contentions. See infra section VII.E. "
1387,30," At the hearing on Samsung's motion to dismiss these patents because they claim ineligible subject matter, Huawei argued that 
the court should have experts explaining the technology and ""that there could be an appropriate time"" to decide the issue down 
the road. 10/26/16 Hr'g Tr. at 10-11 (Dkt. No. 96). "
1389,31," In Reply, Samsung focuses on the reference to ""the sequences"" in 6D and 17D, which Huawei ignores, to argue that ""[t]his is 
just the type of confusion that shows indefiniteness inherent in the asserted claims."" Reply at 3. But ""the sequences"" in 6D and 
17D describe the ""generated, corresponding sequences."" In other words, the reference does not detract from Huawei's 
interpretation. "
1391,32, eMBMS is Evolved Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service. Akl Report ¶ 68. 
1392,33, Samsung does not contest Motorola's conception of the Motorola Draft. 
1394,34," The parties bicker over the inferences to be drawn from Ms. Yu's testimony. See Opp'n at 5; Reply at 4. Samsung insists that 
Ms. Yu admitted that the agreement omits any reference to patent peace because the parties were unable to agree on the 
""scope and mechanism to include nonessential patents."" Yu Dep. at 91:25-92:5 (Stake Decl., Ex. 20). But the disagreement is 
irrelevant to whether portions of Lasinski's opinions should be stricken. "
1395,35, But Samsung responds that Lasinski did not cite these studies in his report. 
1397,36," Samsung [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] Reply at 14 (citing Lasinski Report, Figure 32)."
1397,37," It further contends that Samsung's French law expert admits that French law does not define these terms, but the cited 
testimony does not reference the terms at all. Samsung pointed out this omission in reply, but did not offer affirmative evidence 
that French law does in fact define these terms. "
1399,38," Samsung challenges the following paragraphs: Ex. 3, ¶ 2.4. (""In contrast, Mr. Lasinski's first report is much more in line with 
the conception of a comparable license analysis that I described in my first report""); id. at ¶ 2.8 (""Lastly, in my opinion, using 
more than one approach, where possible, is likely to lead to more reliable results. This is what Mr. Lasinski has done in his 
opening report by combining the technical essentiality study of Dr. Jackson with contributions data""); id. at ¶ 3.9 (""By contrast, 
the comparable license analysis conducted in Mr. Lasinski's first report is much more in line with the conception of a comparable 
license analysis that I described in my first report because he has discussed comparability of the comparable and focal 
agreement along several criteria, including date of the agreement, the scope of the licensed portfolio, and the nature of the 
licensee's products. He has considered Huawei's agreements with Ericsson, Nokia, InterDigital Apple, NTT DoCoMo and 
Qualcomm as well as Samsung's agreements with Ericsson, Nokia, InterDigital, NEC and Qualcomm, has assessed in detail 
which of those agreements are comparable given the parties, circumstances, and structure of the agreements, and has 
unpacked those comparable agreements to inform his opinion as to the FRAND rate. As such, Mr. Lasinski appropriately used 
information from more than one license to guide and check his analysis. Therefore his analysis is better designed to ensure a 
FRAND rate is derived for Huawei and Samsung's SEP portfolios""); id. at ¶ 4.5 (""Moreover, research has shown that several of 
these different approaches can be used simultaneously and in combination to more effectively measure patent value. I 
understand Mr. Lasinski has done so in his opening report by combining the essentiality study of Dr. Jackson with the 
contributions data""). "
1400,39," Samsung offers an inapposite hypothetical to ""demonstrate[] the absurdity of Huawei's position[:] [s]uppose an associate 
working for Huawei's counsel were tasked with going through the Concur IP database and marking all of Huawei's patents 
'essential while demining all other patents 'non-essential.'"" Reply at 9 n.7. Under this scenario, Huawei's accounting expert 
would then take this database and ""value the patents of anyone other than Huawei at zero, highly distorting his 'comparable 
license' and 'top-down' approaches in Huawei's favor."" Id. But under this hypothetical, Samsung would have ample grounds for 
challenging the methodology of the associate in generating the data underlying Lasinski's opinions. Here, Samsung is not 
actually challenging the methodology of any of the individuals involved in developing the database."
1400,40," In Reply, Samsung focuses more on its contention that Jackson is merely serving as a conduit to introduce the opinions of Dr. 
Kakaes. See Reply at 10. But, regardless of the quantity of Kakaes's work used in compiling the database, Jackson's opinions 
are clearly his own. As Huawei points out, Samsung could have sought to depose Kakaes or members of the Concur IP team, 
but it did not. "
1401,41," Samsung does not request specific paragraphs to be excluded. To the extent that this direction is unclear, the parties may 
determine via motions in limine precisely which of Dr. deLisle's opinions are admissible at trial. "
1403,42," In support of its argument, Samsung cites to out-of-district cases for the proposition that a party waives indefiniteness 
challenges by not raising them in claim construction briefing. See Edgewell Pers. Care Brands, LLC v. Albaad Massuot Yitzhak, 
Ltd., No. CV 15-1188-RGA, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 70242, 2017 WL 1900736, at *4 (D. Del. May 9, 2017); Silver State 
Intellectual Techs., Inc. v. Garmin Int'l, Inc., 32 F. Supp. 3d 1155 (D. Nev. 2014). But neither case stands for the proposition that 
a challenge must clearly be labeled as one for ""indefiniteness."" The Edgewell court found that the defendants waived a 
challenge to ""truncated"" based on their assertion that it would be unclear where the truncation begins, when they failed to raise 
the argument in their briefing. 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 70242, 2017 WL 1900736, at *4. But the court also noted, ""[e]ven assuming 
it was not waived, one skilled in the art would understand with reasonable certainty where the truncation begins in light of the 
figures provided the specification."" Id. And the Silver State court denied Garmin's motion to amend its invalidity contentions 
when it based its challenge on the court's claim construction and waited two months to amend. 32 F. Supp. 3d at 1166. Neither 
case is helpful here, where Samsung's argument is essentially that Huawei did not label its ""will not work"" argument as an 
indefiniteness challenge. "
1406,43," Unlike Samsung's Interrogatory No. 4, this request sought ""design-around alternatives"" that ""could have been utilized"" in lieu 
of Huawei's asserted patents. "
1407,44," Huawei notes (without support) that Samsung served these responses at 11 pm on the last day of fact discovery, so it ""could 
not have responded with its equivalents argument before discovery closed."" Opp'n at 5."
1407,45," As discussed above, Huawei has moved to exclude these portions of Dr. Madisetti's report because they apply overly narrow 
interpretations of claim terms. See supra section IV.E.1. "
1410,1," The decisions of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, as that court existed on September 30, 1981, handed

the district courts, and the bankruptcy courts in the circuit. Bonner v. Pritchard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1207 (11th Cir. 1981) (en banc). "

1442,2," Under the incorporation by reference doctrine, a court may consider a document extrinsic to the complaint in deciding a Rule

Broker Defendants' joint reply as ""Def. Reply"" (Dkt. #115); and to EquiLend's reply as ""EquiLend Reply"" (Dkt. #114). The Court pauses to observe that the briefing on all sides was excellent, for which the Court extends its gratitude. "
1488,2," The claims against Bank of America Corporation were dismissed without prejudice by stipulation of the parties on January 26, 
2018. (Dkt. #105). However, due to Bank of America Corporation's 2009 acquisition of Merrill Lynch & Co., and to Bank of 
America Securities LLC's 2010 merger with Defendant Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc., the Amended Complaint uses 
the term ""Bank of America"" to refer to Defendants Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc., Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing 
Corp., Merrill Lynch L.P. Holdings, Inc., and their parents, subsidiaries, and affiliates. (AC ¶¶ 46, 50). This Opinion will do the

(USA) LLC and Credit Suisse Prime Securities Services (USA) LLC are registered as broker-dealers with the SEC. (Id. at ¶¶ 53-

1488,6," The term ""Morgan Stanley"" refers collectively to Defendants Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, Prime Dealer Services Corp., and 
Strategic Investments I, Inc. (AC ¶¶ 73-75, 77). Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and Prime Dealer Services Corp. are registered as 
broker-dealers with the SEC, and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC is also a member of OCC. (Id. at ¶¶ 73-74, 76)."
1488,7," The term ""UBS"" refers collectively to Defendants UBS Americas Inc., UBS Securities LLC, and UBS Financial Services Inc. 
(AC ¶¶ 80-82, 86). UBS Americas Inc. is a part owner of Defendant EquiLend. (Id. at ¶ 80). UBS Securities LLC and UBS 
Financial Services Inc. are registered broker-dealers with the SEC and members of OCC. (Id. at ¶¶ 81-82)."
1488,8," The term ""EquiLend"" refers to Defendants EquiLend Holdings LLC, EquiLend LLC, EquiLend Europe Limited, and their

1491,9," The Amended Complaint also touts AQS's partnership with ""DTC"" (see AC ¶ 161), which is a subsidiary of DTCC that operates 
in conjunction with SunGuard (see id. at ¶ 162). "
1501,10," Of course, Defendants may well succeed at the summary judgment stage in arguing that their refusal to provide clearing-
broker services was in their own economic self-interest and a ""coincidence, independent responses to common stimuli[.]"" United 
States v. Apple, Inc., 791 F.3d 290, 315 (2d Cir. 2015) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). But such a conclusion 
would require factual determinations that the Court will not indulge when considering a motion to dismiss. See Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 
678. "

1504,12," Defendants argue, and Plaintiffs do not contest, that other allegations fall short of qualifying as direct evidence of conspiracy. 
These include, for example, an unnamed executive's statement that Credit Suisse would pursue an exchange through EquiLend 
rather than invest in SL-x, which Defendants argue is a natural unilateral decision not to invest in a competitor. (AC ¶ 17; Def. Br. 
22; Def. Reply 6). In this regard, Defendants contend that the allegation of a 2009 ""meeting of 'the five families' ... [to] settle on 
their collective messaging"" for an anticipated discussion with the SEC does not plead direct evidence of conspiracy. (AC ¶ 202; 
Def. Br. 20). Defendants argue that (i) this meeting ""could not have been conspiratorial"" because it was organized by Bank of 
America, which was not alleged to have joined the conspiracy until 2011; (ii) the Amended Complaint fails to specify either who 
attended the meeting or when and where it occurred; and (iii) a meeting to coordinate messaging to a public official is not an 
antitrust violation. (Def. Br. 20). Defendants also contest that the reference to ""five families"" fails adequately to allege direct 
evidence because Plaintiffs never identify to whom the phrase refers or connect the phrase to the alleged conspiracy. (Id.). And 
the allegation of use of the ""Project Gateway"" code word does not, in Defendants' view, plead direct evidence because the 
phrase was used to refer to lawful joint venture discussions by Thomas Wipf and William Conley about Morgan Stanley and 
Goldman Sachs potentially purchasing AQS. (Def. Br. 21; Def. Reply 7; see also AC ¶¶ 11, 21-22, 294-97, 363). Finally, 
Defendants claim that the allegation that Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs conspiratorially secured the participation of the 
other Defendants lacks the specifics necessary to count as direct evidence of conspiracy. (Def. Br. 21). However, the fact that 
these, and perhaps many more, allegations in the Amended Complaint do not satisfy the standard to plead direct evidence does 
not mean that the Amended Complaint does not contain other, well-pleaded allegations of direct evidence of conspiracy. "
1505,13," Defendants suggest that the 2011 date is significant because it is ""two years after the alleged conspiracy commenced."" (Def. 
Br. 25). This reasoning lacks merit because the Amended Complaint does not allege that Bank of America joined the conspiracy 
until 2011. "
1515,14," The parties dispute whether a claim accrues when ""the defendant commits an act that injures the plaintiff"" (Def. Br. 45), or 
""when the injury occurs"" (Pl. Opp. 50). Despite Defendants' apparent attempt to capitalize on the ambiguity of the phrase 
""commits an act that injures the plaintiff"" (Def. Br. 45), the law is clear that the claim accrues at the time of injury. See Zenith 
Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 401 U.S. 321, 338-39, 91 S. Ct. 795, 28 L. Ed. 2d 77 (1971). (See also Def. Reply 22 
(acknowledging that a claim accrues ""[a]s soon as a plaintiff suffers any injury from an allegedly wrongful act"")). "
1516,15," The facts alleged in In re IRS as a whole were far broader, and included boycotts of third-party platforms over which the 
defendants did not exercise direct control. In re IRS, 261 F. Supp. 3d at 452-59. However, the majority of those other allegations 
occurred within the limitations period, and the court did not consider whether they qualified as an inherently self-concealing 
conspiracy to trigger equitable tolling. Id. at 487-90. "
1517,16," Plaintiffs specifically rely on the following alleged statements: On April 8, 2008, the Managing Director and General Manager 
of DTCC's Fixed Income Clearance and Settlement Group, Thomas Costa, told AQS executives that ""this sounds great, but 
who's going to start your car in the morning?"" (AC ¶ 171); in and around 2009, ""Defendants conducted several meetings with 
AQS executives, initially expressing (or feigning) interest in the product"" (id. at ¶ 209); on February 26, 2013, Credit Suisse's 
European Prime Brokerage Desk Head, Karl Bishti, told SL-x executives that ""the product's functionality included 'all the bells 
and whistles' he would expect, that the platform lacked nothing that he could identify, and that he saw 'no shortcomings'"" (id. at ¶ 
230); on March 19, 2013, Deutsche Bank's Head of Supply Trading, Kevin Soobadoo, told SL-x executives that ""the platform 
was 'brilliant' and 'impressive' and was the 'most state-of-the-art piece of kit to hit the securities lending space"" (AC ¶ 230); on 
February 28, 2013, executives from Nomura called the SL-x platform ""fantastic"" (id.); on October 17, 2013, executives from 
Société Générale called the SL-x platform ""really an awesome product"" (id.); on September 6, 2013, UBS executives Casey 
Whymark and Laurent Issner ""said the platform was 'very cool and we are impressed'"" (id.); between November 2012 and May 
2013, representatives from Defendant J.P. Morgan had several meetings with SL-x executives and ""praised the SL-x product"" 
(id. at ¶ 238); in October, 2014, a Morgan Stanley press release announced that ""Morgan Stanley is supportive of CCP [central 
clearing] solutions"" (id. at ¶ 380)(a)); in an October, 2016 interview, Thomas Wipf described the growth of ""Morgan Stanley's 
central clearing on Eurex"" (id. at ¶ 380(b)); and on August 1, 2016, EquiLend CEO, Brian Lamb, stated that ""[m]omentum has 
been building in the past two years in support of CCPs [central clearing]"" (id. at ¶ 380(c)). "
1524,1," When citing electronic filings throughout this opinion, the Court cites to the ECF page number, not the page number of the filed 
document. "
1527,2," Landmark's case against Regal was settled before the district court resolved Regal's motion to dismiss. See Stipulation, ECF 
No. 19 (Civ. No. 16-123). "
1530,3," Moreover, the Court is not persuaded by Landmark's misplaced reliance on Six West Retail Acquisition, Inc. v. Sony Theatre 
Management Corp. See Defs.' Mot., ECF No. 16 at 27 (citing Civ. No. 97-5499, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5411, 2004 WL 691680 at 
*11 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 31, 2004)). Landmark states that the plaintiff's attempted monopolization claim in that case was ""dismiss[ed],"" 
id., but Six West was actually resolved ""after years of discovery,"" 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5411, 2004 WL 691680 at *3-4, 7. "
1538,1," To the extent Defendant challenges Plaintiff's claims for intentional interference with contractual relations and intentional 
interference with prospective economic advantage, the Court finds that they are adequately pled. "
1539,2," To the extent that Defendant disputes the relevant market as pled by Plaintiff, the Court must deny the motion to dismiss based 
on the allegations regarding the relevant market, because ""the validity of the 'relevant market' is typically a factual element rather 
than a legal element, alleged markets may survive scrutiny under Rule 12(b)(6) subject to factual testing by summary judgment 
or trial."" Newcal, 513 F.3d at 1044. The complaint adequately states a relevant market. "
1548,1," Defendants essentially concede this narrow point in their Memorandum in Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary 
Injunction, which acknowledges that ""a market could be the market for the sale of boiler water treatment chemicals."" ECF No. 
50-2 at 2; see also ECF No. 50-2 at 28 (describing the appropriateness of separate BWT and CWT product markets). "
1549,2," Defendants' argument regarding the lack of interchangeability between BWT and CWT—i.e., the alleged product market's 
""overinclusiveness""—is at odds with the concept of a cluster market as a doctrine that ""allow[s] items that are not substitutes for 
each other to be clustered together in one antitrust market for analytical convenience."" Staples II, 190 F. Supp. 3d at 117."
1549,3," The FTC also notes that for both BWT and CWT, ""Defendants have similar market shares, earn similar margins, and face a 
nearly identical set of competitors,"" PFF ¶ 12, and the margins and revenue shares are higher than for other marine products. 
PX-61002 ¶¶ 84, 85. To be sure, competitive conditions for BWT and CWT are not identical. Defendants have noted that while 
engine manufacturers approve specific brands of CWT chemicals for use in their engines, DX-2599 at 0007, boiler 
manufacturers do not maintain any such list. DX-0060 ¶ 67. Moreover, there is at least one supplier of CWT chemicals that does 
not supply BWT chemicals. DX-0060 ¶ 67. Nevertheless, the law on cluster markets requires only similarity in competitive 
conditions—not indistinguishability. See Staples II, 190 F. Supp. 3d at 117. "
1550,4,"  The table above, taken from DX-0060 at 0018, indicates that BWT and CWT products account for [TEXT REDACTED BY THE 
COURT]and[TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT]of WSS and Drew's ""water treatment products"" revenue, respectively. All other 
chemicals in the category together account for only [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT]and [TEXT REDACTED BY THE 
COURT]of water treatment products revenue. "
1552,5," Although WSS President and CEO Bjoerge Grimholt testified that trading pattern was not used internally for sales purposes, 
Grimholt Hrg. Tr. at 1224:24-25, this assertion is at odds with internal WSS documents explicitly using trading patterns to track 
sales and define market segments for sales purposes, see, e.g., JX-0188 at 044-45, and with Grimholt's deposition testimony 
explaining the relationship between the two. PX70006 (Grimholt IH Vol. 1 Tr.) at 164:23-167:15. "
1555,6," Defendants argue that industrial suppliers and ship chandlers should be included as sellers in the relevant market, insofar as 
they sell some MWT chemicals to marine customers. The court disagrees. The evidence establishes that industrial suppliers 
focus most of their business on providing water treatment for industrial use on land, and have very limited involvement in the 
marine market. See, e.g., Lange Hrg. Tr. at 1141:1-9 (noting that Nalco (owned by Ecolab) does not promote itself to the marine 
business), 1143:2-17 (describing total of [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] in annual sales to marine industry, [TEXT 
REDACTED BY THE COURT] of which is to WSS); JX-0283 at 001 (explaining that [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] ""deals 
with water treatment chemicals for manufacturing industry sector on 'land,'"" that only [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] deals 
with water treatment for the marine sector, and that it only sells to a distributor in Japan). Additionally, Defendants have not 
shown that the small number of marine sales attributable to industrial suppliers includes the range of additional services that 
comprise the ""total solution"" that WSS and Drew provide. Cf. Sysco, 113 F. Supp. 3d at 26 (""[F]or example, fruit can be bought 
from both a grocery store and a fruit stand, but no one would reasonably assert that buying all of one's groceries from a fruit 
stand is a reasonable substitute for buying from a grocery store.""). Defendants have also produced no evidence to suggest that "
1556,," ship chandlers—marine retailers that stock a wide range of consumable goods in warehouses near ports—provide that solution. 
The same is true of testing equipment manufacturers. These observations are consistent with the HMT results, which suggest 
that neither industrial suppliers nor ship chandlers would be considered viable substitutes by any significant group of customers 
in the event of a price increase. To the extent that Defendants suggest that ship chandlers or other companies could easily 
reorganize to supply a total MWT solution that argument relates to ease of entry into the market, not to current market 
conditions. "
1557,7," Though Dr. Nevo believes that the PSM tends to overestimate the size of the market and accordingly understate market 
concentration, he found that the results of his calculations using the PSM do not qualitatively differ from those obtained using 
revenue information from MWT suppliers. PX61000 ¶ 251."
1557,8," Defendants contend that the revenue information upon which Dr. Nevo relied is ""unverified"" because he made no effort to verify 
the accuracy of the information with the submitting parties. Hrg. Tr. at 1877:10-12. The court notes however that much of the 
revenue information was included in declarations given under penalty of perjury, and although some was provided in email 
communications with the FTC, Defendants have not proffered any specific reason to doubt the information's accuracy. "
1558,9," The court does however have concerns about Dr. Israel's ""single invoice"" rule. In an effort to exclude ""one-off"" purchasers, that 
rule excludes any vessel with only a single invoice in 2017, regardless of how much was purchased in that invoice and 
regardless of the timing of purchases from year to year. Thus, if a vessel were to purchase multiple times from Defendants in 
2015 and 2016, but only once in 2017, the single invoice rule would treat that vessel as a non-loyal customer that bought its total 
supply of MWT elsewhere—ignoring the quantity it did buy from Defendants during 2017, and discounting the possibility that the 
vessel stocked up on supplies for the relevant time period, or experienced downtime, or did not need to purchase again during 
that year for some other reason. "
1559,10," The complete results of these trials are presented in Dr. Nevo's reply report at PX61002 ¶ 104 Ex. 8. The relevant HHI 
statistics are summarized in the chart below: Alternative Market Definition Post-merser ran HHI Supply of marine water treatment to all vessels"

"
1561,11," See, e.g., [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] (describing process of pitting WSS and Drew against one another, resulting in 
lower prices); Knowles Hrg. Tr. at 1426:23-1427:6 (describing how Drew won [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] business 
through competitive pricing against WSS); PX20063 (internal WSS email describing ""aggressive offer from Drew"" leading to 
increase in cost savings for Global Fleet customer); PX10346 at 002 (describing multiple non-price benefits afforded by Drew to 
Global Fleet customer in an effort to win business from WSS)."
1561,12," Defendants argue that current market pricing is inconsistent with the notion that they exercise market power. This is because 
the generally low cost of MWT (as a function of vessel operating cost) relative to the importance of the products should 
incentivize suppliers to charge higher prices to realize maximum value. Defendants argue that the fact that suppliers have not 
done so indicates that the products must exist in a competitive environment—not a highly concentrated (and therefore 
noncompetitive) one. Israel Hrg. Tr. at 1500:8-1501:17. However, the court does not understand the FTC to contend that the 
current market is noncompetitive—rather, the FTC contends that the market is competitive, and that the continued 
competitiveness of the market depends on aggressive competition between the two existing global suppliers with high market 
shares. A head-to-head competition theory is not inconsistent with the presence of lower prices in the current market. "
1562,13," Dr. Nevo's calculations did not rely on the salesforce data for the Drew GUPPI because that data was unavailable. Nevo Hrg. 
Tr. at 660:15-16. "
1563,14," The court also acknowledges the vessel-level ""switching"" study performed by Dr. Israel, which investigated head-to-head 
competition by examining what happens when vessels stop buying MWT from one of the merging parties, in order to find out 
whether the vessels ""switch"" to the other merging party or go elsewhere. Essentially, Dr. Israel used sales data to focus on 
vessels weighing 1,000 gross tons or more that purchase from one of the merging parties in one year but not the next year (or 
years, in some formulations). If that vessel disappeared from the invoice data for one party, and did not show up in the invoice 
data for the other within the relevant time period, Dr. Israel counted it as a ""loss."" Dr. Israel's results indicated that most vessels 
that switch from one merging party do not typically switch to the other. DX-0060 at ¶ 124 & Appendix 3. Dr. Israel's study does not factor heavily in the court's calculus for several reasons: (1) the study does not appear to address the 
effect of the transaction on fleet-level bargaining over framework agreements, unlike Dr. Nevo's studies; (2) it employs the 
single-invoice rule, which this court has already found to be problematic in note 9, supra; (3) it assumes that vessel absences 
from sales data for a given period mean that another supplier is serving its needs, but provides no data to support that 
assumption (while the FTC has come forward with some evidence to show that the assumption is false or true in only a small 
number of cases that do not relate to competitive considerations, see, e.g., PX70025 (Sarro Dep. Tr. at 116:12-23); PX40031 at 
001)). "
1566,15," Defendants' contention that customers who believe that there are no other MWT suppliers capable of serving their needs are 
uninformed is itself indicative of the importance of reputation in the industry—if reputation were less important, it is unlikely that a 
sophisticated customer would fail to investigate potentially cheaper alternatives. "

1589,17," Celgene's motion for summary judgment seeks dismissal of Mylan's claims for attempted monopolization and denial of an 
""essential facility."" (See, e.g., D.E. No. 240 at 8 n.8). But Celgene's proffered basis for dismissal of these claims assumes that—
whether before or after FDA approval—there is no genuine issue of material fact that Celgene had a legitimate business 
justification for refusing to provide samples of Thalomid® and Revlimid®. (See id.). Because the Court cannot dismiss Mylan's 
claims insofar as they concern Celgene's conduct after FDA approval of Mylan's protocols, the Court cannot dismiss Mylan's 
claims for attempted monopolization and denial of an ""essential facility"" at this time. Similarly, because Mylan's state antitrust claims rise and fall with the federal antitrust claims, the Court denies Celgene's motion 
insofar as it seeks dismissal of those claims in their entirety. (See D.E. No. 277 at 184:11-23). "
1590,18," (See also D.E. No. 228 at 38 (""Mylan must produce evidence that, but for Celgene's allegedly unlawful conduct, Mylan would 
have: (i) asked Celgene for samples of Revlimid in 2008—five years before it actually did ask; (ii) developed a generic 
lenalidomide product in one-sixth of the time it actually took; (iii) shown that its product was bioequivalent to Revlimid by January 
2010; and (iv) obtained the same patent settlement license from Celgene that Natco did after years of litigation."")). "
1591,19," Giving Mylan the benefit of the doubt, the Court sets aside—for purposes of summary judgment—Mylan's allegation in its 
Complaint that: ""In January 2009, Mylan began efforts to develop a generic equivalent to Celgene's Revlimid."" (D.E. No. 1 ¶ 
131). "

July 29, 2013. (See D.E. No. 228-9, Exs. & 91)."
1593,21," For the reasons stated on the record, the Court denies Mylan's eleventh-hour request to change its damages model. (See D.E. 
No. 271 at 3; D.E. No. 277 at 125:21-136:13, 152:2-13). "

products."" (D.E. No. 281 at 4-5). And the following is undisputed: Celgene's Thalomid® marketing expenses dropped from 
approximately $24 million in 2005 to approximately $14.1 million in 2006 and its Revlimid® marketing expenses increased from 
$18.9 million in 2005 to approximately $51.4 million in 2006 (Celg. Reply SMF ¶ 133)—and, in 2009, Celgene either did not 
respond to or categorically refused all requests from generics to purchase Revlimid® samples (id. ¶ 235). And lenalidomide, an 
analogue of thalidomide, is a more potent product with a better toxicity profile. (Celg. SMF ¶ 86). "
1638,1," The motion to dismiss identifies the ""Distributors"" as AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation, Cardinal Health, Inc., and 
McKesson Corporation. (R. 491, PageID# 7455)."
1638,2," The motion to dismiss identifies the ""Pharmacies"" as Walmart Inc., Rite Aid Corp., Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc., and CVS 
Health Corp. (R. 497, PageID# 7581)."
1638,3," The motion to dismiss identifies the ""Manufacturers"" as Purdue Pharma LP, Purdue Pharma Inc., and The Purdue Frederick

(""Insys""); and Mallinckrodt LLC (""Mallinckrodt""). (R. 499, PageID# 7632)."
1638,4," On May 18, 2018, Plaintiffs filed their Second Amended Complaint (R. 477), which included impermissible amendments. After 
the motions to dismiss were filed, Plaintiffs filed two ""corrected"" Second Amended Complaints on May 29, 2018—a redacted 
version (R. 513) and a sealed version. (R. 514). In order to maintain the integrity of the paragraph numbering from the document 
initially filed on May 18, 2018, the Special Master advised the parties that the subsequent ""corrected"" filings not delete the 
impermissible amendments, but rather use strike-through font to denote those portions that were no longer operative. Although 
the parties' briefs cite to R. 477, the court cites to R. 514 as it is the operative second amended complaint. For the sake of 
brevity, any reference to the ""complaint"" hereafter refers to R. 514. Public users unable to access the sealed version may refer 
to R. 513, where the paragraph numbers should parallel the citations to R. 514. "
1639,5," This report and recommendation provides only a brief overview of the voluminous factual allegations in the over 300 page 
complaint. "
1640,6," Plaintiffs' use of the term ""Marketing Defendants"" includes defendants that have ""manufactured and sold"" prescription opioids 
(R. 514 at ¶63), while those same defendants identify themselves as ""Manufacturer Defendants"" in their motion to dismiss. (R. 
499). For the sake of consistency, the court refers to this category of defendants simply as ""Manufacturers."""
1640,7," The Plaintiffs acknowledge that ""not every Marketing Defendant"" propagated each of the nine misrepresentations, but asserts 
that liability is not predicated upon every Manufacturer perpetuating all nine misrepresentations. (R. 514 at ¶179). "
1642,8," In the complaint, the Plaintiffs also classify the national retail pharmacy defendants as ""Distributor Defendants."" (R. 514 at 
¶¶107, 111-112, 124-128). These defendants, however, moved separately to dismiss the complaint and, in the Analysis section, 
the court differentiates between these two categories of defendants by referring to them either as ""Distributors"" or ""Pharmacies."" 
For the purposes of this section only, the Plaintiffs' references to the Distributor defendants in the complaint may encompass the 
Pharmacies. "
1643,9," HDMA is the Healthcare Distribution Management Association, the predecessor of HDA. (R. 514 at ¶522)."
1643,10," The complaint states that from 2010 to 2016, according to Ohio data, Summit County, whose population is 540,000 residents, 
averaged 36.4 million doses of opioids dispensed per year, with a high of 39.5 million. (R. 514 at ¶689). "
1644,11," The court views the ""direct injury"" requirement as a consideration in the proximate cause inquiry and, therefore, addresses it 
below. In re Neurontin Mktg. & Sales Practice Litig., 712 F.3d 21, 36 (1st Cir. 2013) (citing Holmes, 503 U.S. at 274 (""our use of 
the term 'direct' should merely be understood as a reference to the proximate-cause enquiry"")); see also Wallace v. Midwest Fin. 
& Mortg. Servs., Inc., 714 F.3d 414, 419 (6th Cir. 2013) (stating that RICO incorporated ""many traditional proximate-cause 
considerations,"" and that ""[o]ne such consideration is directness....""). "
1645,12," The Canyon County decision appears to endorse a restrictive reading of Hawaii expressly rejected by Reiter. ""[T]he language 
of an opinion is not always to be parsed as though we were dealing with language of a statute."" 442 U.S. at 341-342 (explaining 
that a ""central premise"" in Hawaii was a ""concern over duplicative recoveries"" and noting that the state of Hawaii was essentially 
trying to recover injuries to the business or property of consumers who could recover their own damage). "
1646,13," See also Miller v. York Risk Servs. Grp., 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 173354, 2013 WL 6442764, at *3 (D. Ariz. Dec. 9, 2013) 
(distinguishing between the Sixth Circuit's federal statutory purpose inquiry and the Ninth Circuit's state-law based approach with 
respect to determining whether there has been a RICO injury to business or property), adopted, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 191271, 
2013 WL 11739992 (D. Ariz. Dec. 19, 2013). "
1647,14," Canyon County relied upon City of Flagstaff v. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. Co., 719 F.2d 322, 324 (9th Cir. 1983). The 
Flagstaff court applied the municipal cost recovery rule, but noted that it does not stand for the proposition that ""a governmental 
entity may never recover the cost of its services. Recovery is permitted where it is authorized by statute or regulation ... or 
required to effect the intent of federal legislation [or] ... where the acts of a private party create a public nuisance which the 
government seeks to abate.""). "
1648,15," The court determined the ""Municipal Cost Recovery Rule does not apply to cases ... where a municipality seeks to recover 
damages for the cost of abating a nuisance."" Further, it also indicated that ""if the City has a worthy claim, application of the 
Municipal Cost Recovery Rule would leave the City without a remedy."" Arms Tech., Inc., 359 N.J. Super. at 327-28. The court 
noted: ""[i]f tortious conduct exists, the consequence is that the gun manufacturers are subsidized for their wrongful acts, and the 
cost of the governmental services must be borne by the taxpayers of the City. This result is fundamentally unfair, given the City's 
limited resources and strained ability to provide other essential services to its citizens. Application of the rule also serves as a 
disincentive; if culpable, the insulated defendants have no reason to obtain liability insurance to cover the cost of their conduct, 
or to take reasonable measures to eliminate, or at least reduce, the harm resulting from the use of their product."" Id. at 328."
1648,16," The Sixth Circuit's citations to Canyon County in three decisions cannot be construed as endorsing its holding with respect to 
the ""municipal cost recovery rule,"" as discussion of that doctrine is entirely absent from those cases. See Saia v. Flying J. Inc., 
2017 U.S. App. LEXIS 25872, 2017 WL 6398013, at *3 (6th Cir. July 11, 2017), cert. denied, 138 S. Ct. 657, 199 L. Ed. 2d 533 
(2018), reh'g denied, 138 S. Ct. 1182, 200 L. Ed. 2d 328 (2018); Stooksbury v. Ross, 528 F. App'x 547, 555 (6th Cir. 2013); City 
of Cleveland v. Ameriquest Mort. Sec., Inc., 615 F.3d 496, 504, 506 (6th Cir. 2010)."
1648,17," The court also notes that a recent New York supreme court decision addressed whether local governmental entities, who 
brought suit against opioid manufacturers, were barred from recovering the costs of governmental services by the municipal cost 
recovery rule. In re Opioid Litigation, 2018 N.Y. Misc. LEXIS 2428, 2018 WL 3115102 (N.Y. Sup. Ct., Jun. 18, 2018). The court 
found as follows: [A] review of the current state of the law revealed no case law supporting the Manufacturers' contention that such rule bars 
recovery for municipal expenses incurred, not by reason of an accident or an emergency situation necessitating ""the normal 
provision of police, fire and emergency services,"" but to remedy public harm caused by an intentional, persistent course of 
deceptive conduct. The Manufacturers' argument that, despite allegations they designed and implemented materially 
deceptive marketing campaigns to mislead the public and prescribers about the risks and benefits of prescription 
opioids, [*94]  the municipal cost recovery rule forecloses the plaintiffs from recovering the costs for services to treat 
residents suffering from prescription opioid abuse, addiction or overdose, or for the increased costs of programs 
implemented to stem prescription opioid-related criminal activities, if accepted, would distort the doctrine beyond 
recognition. Id. (citations omitted). "
1649,18," The court's recommendation should not be misconstrued as an affirmative finding that none of Plaintiffs' claimed damages are 
premised upon pecuniary damages flowing from personal injuries. In addition, to the extent that Plaintiffs seek damages for 
losses of property value in their communities, such claims may, after discovery, be too speculative. See, e.g. Ameriquest, 615 
F.3d at 505-506. However, in this case, such arguments are more appropriate after the record has been developed. "
1650,19," To the extent Defendants argue that Plaintiffs allegations fail to satisfy Rule 9(b)'s pleading requirements, such argument is 
not persuasive, because courts have recognized that pleadings are sufficient so long as they provide enough detail to put the 
responding party on notice and enable a response. See infra Section III-A-4-a."
1650,20," To the extent Defendants maintain that Plaintiffs were required to name specific prescribers, this court disagrees. Where the 
alleged scheme is so broad in scope, no meaningful purpose would be served by merely naming a doctor or several doctors to 
serve as examples of physicians who were misled by Defendants' marketing scheme. The complaint alleges that Summit County 
physicians confirmed the existence of the alleged marketing scheme in Summit County. (R. 514 at ¶675). Defendants will 
certainly have the opportunity to request the identity of these doctors during discovery, and Plaintiffs will need to support their 
theories with evidence to withstand a motion for summary judgment or persuade the trier of fact. "
1651,21," Though not a RICO action, the Supreme Court recently addressed proximate cause under the Fair Housing Act (FHA). Bank 
of Am. Corp. v. City of Miami, Fla., 137 S. Ct. 1296, 197 L. Ed. 2d 678 (2017). Significantly, the Court found that Miami's 
allegations—that the Defendant banks had discriminated against minorities leading to property tax and municipal spending 
injuries—arguably fell within the ""zone of interests"" protected by the FHA. Id. at 1303. Further, with respect to proximate cause, 
despite the fact that Miami's alleged injuries clearly went beyond the ""first step"" and flowed through individuals who had allegedly 
been the victims of racially discriminatory lending, the Supreme Court, rather than ordering dismissal, remanded the case for 
further analysis of proximate cause. Id. at 1306, 1311 (""The lower courts should define, in the first instance, the contours of 
proximate cause under the FHA and decide how that standard applies to the City's claims for lost property-tax revenue and 
increased municipal expenses."") Several lower courts have also noted that the fact that a plaintiff's increased costs/damages 
""runs through a separate injury"" to a third party or parties ""does not by itself require dismissal on proximate cause grounds."" Cty. 
of Cook, Illinois v. Wells Fargo & Co., 314 F. Supp. 3d 975, 2018 WL 1469003, at *6 (N.D. Ill. Mar. 26, 2018); City of Oakland, 
2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 100915, 2018 WL 3008538 at *1 (N.D. Cal. June 15, 2018). Nor does the lack of a direct relationship 
between the plaintiff and defendant defeat nor necessarily frustrate proximate cause. The Sixth Circuit found there was sufficient 
directness where there is a ""link between the scheme and the type of injury [plaintiff] suffered."" Wallace, 714 F.3d at 420. ""What 
matters . . . is not whether there is a direct relationship between the plaintiff and defendant, but whether there is a 'sufficiently 
direct relationship between the defendant's wrongful conduct and the plaintiff's injury . . . .'"" In re Volkswagen ""Clean Diesel"" 
Mktg., Sales Pracs., & Prod. Liab. Litig., 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 179652, 2017 WL 4890594, at *9 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 30, 2017) 
(citations omitted). "
1652,22," In City of Oakland, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 100915, 2018 WL 3008538, at *1, a district court, when confronted with a proximate 
cause issue in a claim arising under the FHA, observed that ""where damages are aggregative, precision is not expected. 
Invariably some approximation is required,"" but noted that ""aggregative injury itself does not obviate proximate cause 
analysis...."""
1652,23," The Supreme Court in Bridge v. Phoenix Bond & Indemnity Co., 553 U.S. 639, 128 S. Ct. 2131, 170 L. Ed. 2d 1012 (2008), 
held unanimously that a civil-RICO plaintiff does not need to show that it detrimentally relied on the defendant's alleged 
misrepresentations. See also Wallace, 714 F.3d at 420 (""While reliance is 'often used to prove ... the element of causation,' that 
does not mean it is the only way to do so, nor does that 'transform reliance itself into an element of the cause of action.'"") (citing 
Bridge)."
1652,24," The plaintiffs' primary evidence came from expert testimony from a health economics professor, who used ""aggregate data 
and statistical approaches to link patterns in promotional spending to patterns in prescribing for the drug."" 712 F.3d at 30. The 
expert's regression analysis ""found a causal connection between the fraudulent marketing and the quantity of prescriptions "
1653,," written for off-label indications. She also testified as to why Pfizer's proposed physician-by-physician analysis of causation was 
not a scientifically valid approach to causation."" Id. The expert testified ""as to the well-recognized unreliability in the field of 
healthcare economics of asking doctors individually whether they were influenced by the many methods of off-label marketing. 
She said that self-reporting from physicians about patterns of practice that may be controversial shows both conscious 
reluctance and unconscious bias, which lead them to deny being influenced."" Id. Although such expert testimony is not before 
the court, this case cautions against prematurely determining, without a sufficiently developed record, that certain allegations 
must be present before causation can be determined to have been sufficiently pled. Defendants' reliance on City of Chicago v. 
Purdue Pharma, L.P., for the proposition that the complaint must specifically identify doctors is misplaced, as the district court 
was addressing state law claims and found that the plaintiffs failed to allege sufficient detail about the false claims. 2015 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 60587, 2015 WL 2208423, at *14 (N.D. Ill. May 8, 2015). Thus, the court finds that the absence ""self-reports"" from 
physicians in the complaint is not dispositive. In addition, the court finds the rationale of In re Neurontin more compelling."
1653,25," The court recognizes that overdoses involving prescribed opioids may also include individuals who were not the prescribed 
user of the drug. The fact that this category may include both illicit users as well as those who were prescribed the opioids in 
question does not preclude proximate cause or warrant dismissal at this preliminary stage. "
1654,26," It is not entirely clear whether Plaintiffs are merely differentiating case law with this statement or disclaiming any interest in 
monies spent by private providers of emergency services. In any event, it does not meaningfully impact the court's conclusion."
1654,27," If discovery were to reveal that Plaintiffs routinely assessed these costs to the individuals who required them and/or to their 
insurers, and that Plaintiffs actually recovered such costs, Defendants would in no way be precluded from arguing that no 
damages were incurred."
1654,28," Defendants have stridently asserted that civil RICO damages are unavailable for personal injuries. (R. 491-1, PageID# 7478-
7479; R. 499-1, PageID# 7665). In such case, patients, who were inappropriately prescribed opioids and suffered physical or 
mental injuries as a result, would be precluded from bringing a RICO claim to recover for their personal injuries. "
1657,29," In Schmuck, 489 U.S. at 710-711, the Supreme Court explained that: The federal mail fraud statute does not purport to reach all frauds, but only those limited instances in which the use of the 
mails is a part of the execution of the fraud, leaving all other cases to be dealt with by appropriate state law."" To be part of 
the execution of the fraud, however, the use of the mails need not be an essential element of the scheme. It is sufficient for 
the mailing to be ""incident to an essential part of the scheme,"" or ""a step in [the] plot."" (internal citations and footnotes omitted)."
1657,30," Defendants repeated statement that Plaintiffs have failed to identify even one Summit County prescriber who relied on the 
misrepresentations is a red herring. Plaintiffs allege that interviews with Summit County doctors have confirmed that Defendants' 
sales representatives ""carried the deceptive messages to local prescribers."" (R. 514 at ¶675). Defendants will have ample 
opportunity to ascertain the identity of these doctors in discovery. The allegation that Ohio is one of the hardest hit states by the 
opioid epidemic, with 39.5 million opioid doses dispensed in Summit County in 2012 alone for a county-wide population of 
540,000, coupled with the allegation that it leads the nation in overdose deaths per capita, when accepted as true, renders 
hollow any notion that the Defendants' more than a decade long nationwide push to expand prescription opioid use failed to 
permeate Summit County. Id. at ¶¶689, 714-719. "
1659,31," § 842 applies to persons who ""refuse or negligently fail to make, keep, or furnish any record, report, notification, declaration, 
order or order form, statement, invoice, or information required under this subchapter or subchapter II...."" The complaint alleges 
intentional conduct that goes well beyond negligence—that Defendants knew about suspicious orders from their own sales 
representatives and the exacting data they kept but concealed them. (R. 514 at ¶¶554-593)."
1659,32," The Distributors cite one non-binding decision in their argument: In re Epogen & Aranesp Off-Label Mktg. & Sales Practices 
Litig., 590 F. Supp. 2d 1282, 1290 (C.D. Cal. 2008). (R. 491-1, PageID# 7488-7489). That case, however, is inapposite and 
contains no discussion at all as to whether a violation of § 843(a)(4)(A) may serve as a predicate act under the language of § 
1961(1)(D). Further, the plaintiff therein alleged RICO liability solely on the basis of off-label marketing relying exclusively on mail 
and wire fraud as racketeering activities. In re Epogen, 590 F. Supp. 2d at 1287 (""Plaintiffs allege that Defendants' unlawful 
promotion of EPO for unsafe, off-label uses constituted a pattern of racketeering activity, including mail and wire fraud.""). The 
district court did hold that ""[a]llowing Plaintiffs to proceed on a theory that Defendants violated RICO by engaging in off-label 
promotion, without specific allegations that Defendants made false or misleading statements, would, in effect, permit Plaintiffs to 
use RICO as a vehicle to enforce the FDCA and the regulations promulgated thereunder."" Id. at 1289-1290. Plaintiffs correctly 
note that ""the In re Epogen plaintiff did not assert felony predicate acts, claims under the CSA, or the existence of a felony 
violation of the FDCA."" (R. 654, PageID# 15774). Defendants' attempt to portray In re Epogen as holding that a felony violation 
of either the FDCA or the CSA can never serve as a RICO predicate act under § 1961(1)(D) is far too broad and distorts the 
limited scope of the decision. "
1660,33," Undoubtedly, a registrant manufacturer would have the most precise information about orders from its direct customers. 
However, the complaint alleges that the Manufacturers, in concert with the Distributors, collected vast amounts of data that, at 
least plausibly, led to Defendants' discovery of suspicious orders by parties other than their direct customers. "
1661,34," The Manufacturers' reply characterizes Plaintiffs' brief as conceding that various claims are preempted. (R. 746, PageID# 
17706-17707). The court does not construe Plaintiffs' brief as abandoning or conceding any of their state law claims as 
preempted. But after discovery, the Plaintiffs may narrow their claims and Defendants may renew their arguments upon a full 
record. "
1664,35," See, e.g., Aaron v. Durrani, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 32693, 2014 WL 996471, at *8 (S.D. Ohio Mar. 13, 2014) (citing U.S. 
Demolition & Contracting v. O'Rourke, 94 Ohio App. 3d 75, 640 N.E.2d 235, 240 (Ohio Ct. App. 1994)). "
1665,36," The last paragraph emphasizing the inclusion of public nuisance claims was added by amendment and went into effect on 
August 1, 2007. State ex rel. Ohio Gen. Assembly v. Brunner, 115 Ohio St. 3d 103, 2007- Ohio 4460, 873 N.E.2d 1232, 1235 
(Ohio, 2007)."
1665,37," For the sake of brevity, these will be referred to as ""Type 1"" and ""Type 2"" product liability claims respectively."
1665,38," Though Plaintiffs allege an unreasonable interference with a right common to the general public with their common law public 
nuisance claim, pleading in the alternative is permissible. "
1666,39," Defendants argue that framing Plaintiffs' injury as economic loss elevates form over substance, and that the personal injury to 
the users of opioids is the gravamen of the claim. (R. 744, PageID# 17663-17664). The court cannot find, without the benefit of 
any factual discovery, that all of Plaintiffs' claimed injuries stem from death, physical injuries, or physical damage to property."
1666,40," ""Claims that are authorized by the Ohio Products Liability Act should be pled with reference to the applicable provision of the 
Act."" Greenway v. Kimberly-Clark Corp., 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 82446, 2016 WL 3460229, at *2 (N.D. Ohio June 24, 2016) 
(citations omitted). "
1667,41," Notably, State ex rel. Miller did not involve an absolute public nuisance action, but instead considered whether a nuisance 
abatement action brought pursuant to statute—O.R.C. § 3719.10—required a jury trial under Ohio's constitution. The court 
concluded that a jury trial was not required because ""the nuisance abatement provisions of R.C. Chapter 3767 are equitable in 
nature and not created by common law."" 647 N.E.2d at 1371. Thus, it appears the court was focused on the equitable nature of 
the abatement remedy. Furthermore, by Plaintiffs' logic, the statutory-based nuisance action in State ex rel. Miller would not be 
considered a statutory nuisance claim simply because the court characterized the remedy as equitable in nature. The court 
declines to elevate form over substance. "
1668,42," In other words, Plaintiffs contend that non-statutory public nuisance actions in Ohio are equitable actions not common-law 
actions, and the 2007 amendment applies only to common law public nuisance actions. Such a result would completely frustrate 
the Ohio Legislature's clear intent to abrogate common-law public nuisance actions, as the amendment would have no 
applicability."
1668,43," The argument that the harm requirements of Type 1 claims should be bootstrapped to Type 2 claims is not well taken. As 
noted above, the court should apply the plain language of the statute where it is unambiguous. Although this court above found 
that the statute was ambiguous with respect to the question of whether the term ""common law"" modified both the phrase ""any 
public nuisance claim"" and ""cause of action,"" the decision not to include the preexisting language from the Type 1 definition into 
the Type 2 definition speaks volumes. Had the legislature intended such limiting language in the application of OPLA as it relates 
to public nuisance claims, it could easily have repeated the language contained in the Type 1 definition. It opted not to do so. It is 
also telling that the Type 2 definition was not made a subsection of the Type 1 definition, revealing a clear intent to create an 
alternative or additional definition of a ""product liability claim."" "
1669,44," O.R.C. §§ 3719.01(R) & 3719.011 define opiate as ""a drug of abuse."" "
1670,45," O.R.C. § 3767.03 includes a significantly broader list of authorized parties who may maintain a public nuisance action than 
O.R.C. § 4729.35, as it includes the attorney general, the village solicitor, the city or township law director, the county 
prosecutor, or any person who is a citizen of the county in which the nuisance exists so long as the action is brought in the name 
of the state. The ramifications of this discrepancy is addressed below."
1670,46," Plaintiffs also rely on O.R.C. § 715.44, which states as follows: A municipal corporation may: (A) Abate any nuisance and prosecute in any court of competent jurisdiction, any person who creates, continues, 
contributes to, or suffers such nuisance to exist; "
1671,***,  (C) Prevent injury and annoyance from any nuisance;
1671,***, 
1671,47," The Manufacturers also assert that Plaintiffs' Opposition cites to statutory violations not specifically pled, but the complaint 
identifies specific statutes as bases for alleged liability and also states that the claimed violations include, but are not limited to, 
conduct proscribed by Ohio and federal law. (R. 514 at ¶984). "
1673,48," Although the Distributors broadly argued that both Plaintiffs' negligence and nuisance claims should be dismissed based on 
the economic loss doctrine, they made no attempt to distinguish between common law public nuisance claims and statutory 
public nuisance claims. (R. 491-1, PageID# 7513-7514; R. 744, PageID# 17672-17673). ""The doctrine bars tort plaintiffs from 
recovering purely economic loss that 'do not arise from tangible physical injury' to persons or property.'"" Deutsche Bank, 863 
F.3d at 477 (quoting Queen City Terminals v. Gen. Am. Trans., 73 Ohio St. 3d 609, 1995- Ohio 285, 653 N.E.2d 661, 667 (Ohio 
1995)). The movant has presented the court with no compelling reason to apply such a tort doctrine to a statutory claim, 
especially where it does not appear that Plaintiffs seeks any relief beyond that which is permitted by statute. "
1675,49," Nor is it necessary to address Defendants' arguments with regard to negligence per se, as those arguments presuppose 
Plaintiffs' failure to plead a common law duty."
1675,50," While asserting that Plaintiffs' negligence claim should be dismissed, the Manufacturers do not meaningfully develop any new 
argument and adopt earlier arguments. (R. 499-1, PageID# 7702). For the reasons stated elsewhere in this report and 
recommendation, such reiterated arguments, including the assertion that proximate cause is lacking, fail. "
1676,51," Although the Pharmacies were not subject to the RICO claims addressed above, the differences between the allegations 
against them and the remaining Defendants do not compel a different result when addressing the issue of proximate cause. The 
Pharmacies are alleged to have ""failed to report suspicious orders, prevent diversion, or otherwise control the supply of opioids 
[flowing] into communities across America,"" (R. 514 at ¶¶579, 607-626), and have been the subject of fines by the DEA for 
failing to do so. (Id. at ¶¶627-659). Moreover, the Pharmacies, the ultimate dispenser of opioids, are arguably a step closer to 
the injured parties than the other Defendants."
1676,52," As the cited paragraphs illustrate, the Pharmacies' argument to the contrary is misplaced. (R. 742, PageID# 17611). The 
complaint does claim the Distributors could have foreseen, and were aware of, unnecessary prescriptions and the operation of 
pill mills, but nevertheless supplied them. "
1677,53," Manufacturers make only cursory reference to the economic loss doctrine as a reason to dismiss Plaintiffs' negligence claim. 
(R. 499-1, PageID# 7702). They simply cite to Corporex in a bullet point, and then refer to a single paragraph of argument in 
their public nuisance section. Also, the Pharmacies adopt Distributors' arguments. (R. 742, PageID# 17613). "
1678,54," The cases that defendants cite, as plaintiffs note, are distinguishable because there was a lack of evidence supporting 
reliance. See Lucarell, 97 N.E.3d at 473-474 (finding that plaintiff ""failed to prove that any fraudulent representation had been 
made to her"" where fraud claim was based on misrepresentation made by defendant to lender to induce lender to approve 
plaintiff's business loan); Mike McGarry & Sons, Inc. v. Constr. Res. One, LLC, 2018-Ohio-528, ¶ 78-79 (Ohio Ct. App. Feb. 9, "
1679,2018," ) (reversing denial of summary judgment, reasoning that fraud claim could not be maintained where party presented no 
evidence that it took action in reliance on the allegedly false statement)."
1679,55," Defendants acknowledge the lone exception is inapplicable. (R. 499-1, PageID# 7704)."
1679,56," Citing Jane v. Patterson, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 55952, 2017 WL 1345242, at *4 (N.D. Ohio Apr. 12, 2017); A.A. v. Otsego 
Local Sch. Bd. of Educ., 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 176621, 2016 WL 7387261, at *9 (N.D. Ohio Dec. 21, 2016); Ortiz v. Kazimer,

Comp. Exch., Inc. v. Burt, 2003-Ohio-3197, 2003 WL 21414688, at *6 (Ohio Ct. App. June 20, 2003). "
1681,57," The Manufacturers raise this same argument, citing Randleman v. Fid. Nat'l Title Ins. Co., 465 F. Supp. 2d 812, 824 (N.D. 
Ohio 2006) in support. (R. 499-1, PageID# 7706)."
1681,58," Because the Plaintiffs theory of recovery is not based on an economic transaction, the Distributors assertion that White was 
""effectively overruled"" by Johnson does not follow. (R. 744, PageID# 17676). "
1682,59," Plaintiffs also note that potential recovery under unjust enrichment and restitution theories are recognized where third parties 
have assumed costs of pollution remediation necessitated by defendant activities. See, e.g., Little Hocking Water Ass'n, Inc. v. 
E.I. du Pont Nemours & Co., 91 F. Supp. 3d 940, 985-986 (S.D. Ohio 2015) (observing that unjust enrichment may serve as an 
alternative theory of recovery where actual damages are too difficult to determine, but it would be unjust to allow the defendant 
to benefit from the savings it enjoyed without payment to the plaintiff) (citing cases). (R. 654, PageID # 15807-08). "
1692,1," EBITDA is a ""surrogate . . . for cash flow"" that investors use as an approximate measure of an entity's profitability. "
1696,2," A die is a tool used to create a specific doorskin design. Because a plant cannot run all its dies simultaneously, the dies in 
service are rotated as needed to meet JELD-WEN's doorskin design needs. However, die changes increase downtime, reducing 
production efficiency and, in turn, production capacity."
1696,3," JELD-WEN decides which plants will supply particular doorskins to customers. Accordingly, even if Steves orders doorskins 
from Towanda, JELD-WEN may supply those doorskins from Dodson or one of its West Virginia plants. Because the mix model "
1697,," ""balance[s] the mix across the group,"" the plant identified by the customer might not make the requested SKU, or might not have 
sufficient volume for supply from that location to be most efficient for all customers."
1697,4," By making the damage award in paragraph 3(a)(1) of the Verdict Form, the jury had to conclude, based on the evidence, that 
Section 6c operated to measure both price increases and price decreases. That is proved by the testimony of the negotiators 
and the evidence about how the parties administered the contract. "
1698,5," JELD-WEN did not communicate with Steves about key input costs or price changes in 2016 or 2017, so the doorskin prices 
imposed in 2015 remained the same for those years."
1698,6," Hachigian subsequently sent Steves a letter, in March 2015, stating that JELD-WEN reserved the right to assert that the Supply 
Agreement terminated on December 31, 2019 (at the end of its normal seven-year term) instead of in September 2021. PTX-
521. JELD-WEN (through Hachigian) abandoned that position at trial. However, proposed acceleration of the termination date is 
further evidence that JELD-WEN was emboldened by the knowledge that, in 2014, the substantial lessening of competition 
caused by the merger allowed JELD-WEN to pressure Steves to accept JELD-WEN's new pricing demands."
1698,7," The record shows that JELD-WEN extracted new contracts from other independent manufacturers requiring them to pay the 
capital charge. That was the result of lessened competition. It was either pay or face termination and the loss of doorskin supply. "
1699,8," In opposing divestiture, JELD-WEN has asserted that it too has experienced quality problems with the products made by these 
foreign manufacturers. Indeed, JELD-WEN argues that product from foreign suppliers cannot help fill the short-fall in supply that 
would ensue a divestiture of Towanda. "
1700,9," Edward Steves stated during his deposition that he realized in early 2013 that the CMI Acquisition had caused the 
""degradation"" of doorskin quality. Apr. 12 Remedies Tr. at 637:19-638:8. However, he later testified that he did not view the 
quality issues as related to the Acquisition. Id. at 685:6-17. Having heard the testimony and reviewed the deposition, the Court 
concludes that Edward Steves was speaking temporally, not causally. "
1701,10," As the parties so often observe, no previous case brought by a private party seeking divestiture under the Clayton Act had 
gone to verdict at the time so Steves had no precedents to inform whether to pursue such a course or, if pursued, what the 
likelihood of success might be. "
1703,11," Towanda's overall profitability is aided by its MiraTEC and Extira production. Towanda is the only facility in the world that 
makes those products. They are produced on Line 2, a sealed press that sits across from Line 1. However, the manufacturing 
process for doorskins and MiraTEC and Extira is intertwined in many respects, so those products share many of the same 
manufacturing facilities in the main plant. As a result, Line 2 and the production equipment needed for MiraTEC and Extira 
cannot be removed as part of divestiture, because doing so would make doorskin production impossible. Any acquisition of 
Towanda's doorskin business, then, must include the acquisition of its MiraTEC and Extira business. "
1704,12," The record shows that, in the event of divestiture, JELD-WEN would continue to buy from Towanda at least until it could build 
a new plant which would take several years or until JELD-WEN could find a reliable source of foreign supply (which, like Steves, 
JELD-WEN has not deemed to be a viable solution). JELD-WEN's counsel have argued that JELD-WEN would not buy from 
divested Towanda. Because JELD-WEN's witnesses said otherwise and counsel's argument makes no sense if JELD-WEN is to 
meet its needs, the argument is rejected. "
1706,13," JELD-WEN's assertion to the contrary is mistaken. See Def. FOF ¶ 190. The contract states that the force majeure provision 
applies ""[w]ithout prejudice to clauses 5.10 to 5.16""—that is, including the cited penalty provision for delivery failures. DX-943 § 
22; see also id. § 5.13. "
1707,14," Enterprise value assesses how the stock market values an entity, taking into account the entity's market capitalization and its 
net debt. "
1710,15," Although eBay applied that test to the Patent Act, the Supreme Court's concluding statement that such discretion also extends 
to ""other cases governed by such standards"" makes clear that the test applies in other cases arising under federal statutes. E.I. 
DuPont de Nemours & Co. v. Kolon Indus., Inc., 894 F. Supp. 2d 691, 697 (E.D. Va. 2012) (citing eBay, 547 U.S. at 394). "
1711,16," The parties dispute whether the Court may rely on the record in the trade secrets trial to help resolve the divestiture issue. See 
Aug. 2 Tr. (ECF No. 1751) at 90:15-91:20, 203:18-206:10. Assuming, without deciding, that the Court can, that record does not 
establish that Steves can prevent going out of business by building a doorskin plant by September 2021. At best, the evidence at 
the trade secrets trial indicates that Steves has preliminarily concluded that building a doorskin plant is not feasible, but is 
continuing to investigate the possibility of doing so. That is no different than what the evidence at the antitrust trial showed. See 
Def. FOF ¶¶ 265-78. "
1713,17," JELD-WEN's claim that Steves should be held accountable here for delaying its efforts to build a doorskin plant is 
unpersuasive, especially where that factor did not affect the jury's future lost profits award. Intentionally engaging in conduct that 
contributes to an irreparable injury may undermine a plaintiff's irreparable harm showing. See Cone v. Randolph Cty. Schs. Bd. 
of Educ., No. 1:06CV00579, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 76684, 2006 WL 3000445, at *5, *7 (M.D.N.C. Oct. 20, 2006) (child's loss of 
educational services was not irreparable injury, in part because it was caused by parents' intentional obstruction of school 
placement plan). However, the minimal, and unpersuasive, evidence cited by JELD-WEN does not establish that Steves ceased 
efforts to build a doorskin plant in order to improve its position in this litigation. Moreover, the record shows that Steves would not 
have made any notable progress towards building a plant had it devoted its full attention during these proceedings to finding a 
manufacturing partner. Steves' irreparable injury thus cannot be traced back to its decision to stop negotiations with 
manufacturing partners. In any event, the record shows that Steves simply cannot afford to build its own doorskin plant so JELD-
WEN's position is academic at best."
1713,18," There were other antitrust damages that also were trebled. Those that survived judgment as a matter of law also will be 
trebled. "
1714,19," JELD-WEN continues to assert that Steves' quantification of damages must have been an election of legal over equitable 
remedies. But this wrongly assumes that Steves was required to make an election at some point before now. ""Generally, a party 
is not required to elect between inconsistent remedies or rights or theories of recovery during the trial or at the pleading stage or 
prior to the jury's verdict; election is generally made after the verdict is entered prior to the entry of judgment."" 28A C.J.S. 
Election of Remedies § 6 (2018). In any event, ""a decision as to the time of election rests within the sound discretion of the trial 
court."" Id.; see also Rahemtulla v. Hassam, No. CIV.A.3:05-0198, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 42902, 2008 WL 2247195, at *1 (M.D. 
Pa. May 30, 2008) (collecting cases). Further, the cases present the so-called ""election of remedies"" issue as a question of how 
to preclude double recovery and how to proceed with entry of judgment where the principles of Brown Shoe Co. operate as they 
do under the facts of this case."
1714,20, Steves has agreed that it is not entitled to both remedies. 
1715,21," That is not to say that all harms that JELD-WEN might allege are cognizable here. For example, loss of profits obtained 
through anticompetitive conduct is not a valid hardship because it is a product of doing what the antitrust laws require—that is, 
competing with other firms. See New York v. Actavis, PLC, No. 14 CIV. 7473, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 172918, 2014 WL 
7015198, at *45 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 11, 2014), aff'd sub nom. New York ex rel. Schneiderman v. Actavis PLC, 787 F.3d 638 (2d Cir. 
2015); see also Cadence Design Sys., Inc. v. Avant! Corp., 125 F.3d 824, 830 (9th Cir. 1997). Yet JELD-WEN does not rely 
much on any such harm, and the instances where it does will be appropriately disregarded without affecting the hardship 
balancing. "
1716,22," The record teaches that building a new doorskin plant is not realistic in the short run, even with JELD-WEN's experience. "
1721,23," The record is not entirely clear why that is so but it appears to be that the losses largely occurred in the door manufacturing 
businesses of CMI at the time because the EBITDA for the doorskin business was positive and, according to JELD-WEN and the 
record, the MiraTec and Extira business was also profitable during that period of time. "
1722,24," Further, as did JELD-WEN in 2012 when it acquired CMI, the new owner will also have the MiraTec and Extira lines and will 
make those products available to the customers who now buy them from JELD-WEN. "
1724,25," If the buyer should be Steves, it will be necessary to make provisions that secure to JELD-WEN the benefits of the jury verdict 
and any relief granted in the trade secrets trial. "
1726,26," Although the Fourth Circuit implicitly approved of that approach, it has not directly addressed the question. See Weinberger v. 
Retail Credit Co., 498 F.2d 552, 556 (4th Cir. 1974). "
1728,27," Steves did not need to suffer actual antitrust injury to bring a Section 16 claim, which requires only ""threatened"" injury. 
However, based on the facts in the record, it is not clear that this distinction is relevant to the outcome here. "
1730,28," At least one case has suggested that the continuing violations doctrine might apply to extend the laches period each time a 
new anticompetitive act occurs. See IT&T, 518 F.2d at 929. However, the Court already noted that this doctrine usually does not 
apply in Clayton Act cases, and held that the anticompetitive effects here were ""unabated inertial consequences"" of the CMI 
Acquisition, not independent Section 7 violations. See Summary Judgment Op. at 30-31 (internal quotations omitted). Therefore, 
any doorskin price increases or quality reductions after August 2014 did not change the beginning date of the laches period. "
1735,1," In evaluating a motion to dismiss, this Court ""accept[s] the allegations in the complaint as true and construe[s] the facts in the 
light most favorable to the plaintiff."" Johnson v. Midland Funding, LLC, 823 F.3d 1334, 1337 (11th Cir. 2016). The following facts, 
are therefore, taken from the allegations contained in Hoglund's Complaint, and the Court makes no ruling on their veracity. "
1737,2," In Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206 (11th Cir. 1981) (en banc), the Eleventh Circuit adopted as binding precedent all 
decisions by the former Fifth Circuit prior to October 1, 1981."
1737,3," To the extent that Hoglund seeks damages under Section Four of the Clayton Act, he is not entitled to them because he has 
not sufficiently alleged violations of any underlying antitrust law. See 15 U.S.C. 15(a). "
1738,4," The ADA has three sections. Title I regulates discrimination in the workplace. Title II prohibits discrimination by public entities. 
Title III prohibits discrimination by private entities in places of public accommodation. Although Hoglund does not specify which 
section of the ADA he claims Charter violated, Charter is neither a public entity nor Hoglund's workplace. Therefore, the Court 
will construe Hoglund's complaint as bringing a claim under Title III. "
1741,1," Plaintiffs Motion to Strike addresses the summary judgment motions by Defendant PABCO, New NGC, Inc. (""National""), and 
USG Corporation, United States Gypsum Company, and L&W Supple Corporation (collectively ""USG Defendants""). In this 
memorandum we address only PABCO's motion, as National has since settled with Plaintiffs, rendering its motion moot. (See 
ECF 331.) USG Defendants' motion is addressed separately in an Order filed this date. "
1743,1," Other motions for summary judgment are also pending and fully briefed, but are not affected by this Order. See Defendants' 
Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on Umbrella Damages (ECF 724), Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment on Choice 
of Law (ECF 754), Defendants' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment concerning Certainteed, Continental, Georgia-Pacific, 
Lafarge, Panel Rey, and Tin (ECF 756), and Defendants' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on Unassigned Claims (ECF 
755). "
1744,2," Homebuilder Plaintiffs' brief, pp. 9-12, details numerous facts, cited in this Court's opinion, concerning USG/L&W 
communications with other defendants. USG/L&W's reply brief shall respond as to these facts of record. "
1750,1," For purposes of the motions to dismiss, the Court accepts as true all of Plaintiff's well-pleaded factual allegations and draws all 
reasonable inferences in Plaintiff's favor. Killingsworth v. HSBC Bank Nev., N.A., 507 F.3d 614, 618 (7th Cir. 2007). "
1753,2," ""[I]n federal question cases consolidated under § 1407, the law of the transferor court warrants 'close consideration' but does 
not bind the transferee court."" In re Sulfuric Acid Antitrust Litig., 743 F. Supp. 2d 827, 853 (N.D. Ill. 2010) (citations omitted)."
1753,3," CDK moves to dismiss all of MVSC's Section 2 claims for failure to establish that it is participant in the EVR market. [45 (CDK 
Br.), at 4.] Although market power in the relevant market is an element of monopolization and attempted monopolization claims 
under Section 2, it is not an element of a conspiracy to monopolize claim. Wagner v. Magellan Health Servs., Inc., 121 F. Supp. 
2d 673, 680 (N.D. Ill. 2000) (""[M]arket power is not an element of a conspiracy to monopolize claim under Section 2."" (citing 
United States v. National City Lines, 186 F.2d 562 (7th Cir. 1951)). The Court therefore focuses on MVSC's monopolization and 
attempted monopolization arguments. "
1754,4," CDK asserts that the Seventh Circuit has long followed the substantial control standard, citing National Lead Co. v. FTC, 227 
F.2d 825 (7th Cir. 1955), rev'd on other grounds, 352 U.S. 419, 77 S. Ct. 502, 1 L. Ed. 2d 438 (1957). [120 (CDK Supp. Br.), at 
2.] However, in National Lead, the Court did not apply the substantial control standard. In that case, the Seventh Circuit held that 
a parent company should have been dismissed from an FTC action for purported violations of the Federal Trade Commission 
Act and the Clayton Act by the parent company's subsidiary. 227 F.2d at 829. In concluding that the parent company never 
""engaged in the [relevant] industry as a producer, distributor or otherwise,"" the court applied a ""substantial identity"" rule, which 
required ""evidence of such complete control of the subsidiary by the parent as to render the former a mere tool of the latter, and 
to compel the conclusion that the corporate identity of the subsidiary is a mere fiction."" Id. at 828-29. But no court has ever cited 
National Lead in support of a ""substantial control"" analysis. Nor would it make sense to do so. When National Lead was decided, 
the Supreme Court still applied the ""now-defunct doctrine known as the 'intraenterprise conspiracy doctrine,'"" under which the 
Supreme Court ""treated cooperation between legally separate entities as necessarily covered by § 1[.]"" Am. Needle, Inc. v. Nat'l 
Football League, 560 U.S. 183, 192, 130 S. Ct. 2201, 176 L. Ed. 2d 947 (2010) (discussing the history of the ""'intraenterprise 
conspiracy doctrine""). It therefore would make sense to require ""evidence of such complete control of the subsidiary by the 
parent as to render the former a mere tool of the latter, and to compel the conclusion that the corporate identity of the subsidiary 
is a mere fiction"" before blurring the legal lines between a parent company and its subsidiary. Given that the Supreme Court has 
abandoned the intraenterprise conspiracy doctrine in favor of a more functional approach, it would be inappropriate to equate the 
strict ""substantial identity"" standard applied in National Lead with the ""substantial control"" standard advanced by the parties in 
this case."
1754,5," Because all parties have relied on the substantial control standard, the Court assumes without deciding that the substantial 
control standard applies. In discussing whether Defendants are a unified entity incapable of conspiring under federal antitrust 
laws pursuant to Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., 467 U.S. 752, 104 S. Ct. 2731, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628 (1984)—, an 
issue addressed in more detail below—MVSC argues that Reynolds is judicially estopped from arguing that it is incapable of 
conspiring with CVR because Reynolds argued in prior motions to dismiss that it was not a participant in the EVR market. In 
other words, because Reynolds previously took the position that it is not a competitor in the EVR market, MVSC argues that it 
cannot claim to be a unified entity with CVR, its partially-owned subsidiary that competes in the EVR market. This position has 
some support. See, e.g., Copperweld Corp., 467 U.S. at 777 (""Any anticompetitive activities of corporations and their wholly 
owned subsidiaries meriting antitrust remedies may be policed adequately without resort to an intra-enterprise conspiracy 
doctrine. A corporation's initial acquisition of control will always be subject to scrutiny under § 1 of the Sherman Act and § 7 of 
the Clayton Act. Thereafter, the enterprise is fully subject to § 2 of the Sherman Act and § 5 of the Federal Trade Commission 
Act."" (internal citations omitted)); In re: Zinc Antitrust Litig., 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 73192, 2016 WL 3167192, at *21 (S.D.N.Y. 
June 6, 2016) (""[D]efendants cannot have it both ways. Glencore Ltd. and Pacorini may not * * * argue that they are incapable of 
conspiring with each other for purposes of forming an anticompetitive agreement in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 
but also argue, on the other hand, that Pacorini may not be individually liable for playing a direct and key role in Glencore Ltd.'s 
ability to control prices in a market in which it competes."" (internal citation omitted)). If that is MVSC's position, however, it is 
unclear why MVSC would rely on the substantial control standard, which might allow a parent company to avoid Section 2 
scrutiny in its subsidiary's market even if the parent and subsidiary were a unified entity under Copperweld."
1754,6," Although the court in Caribbean Broadcasting System cited cases applying agency standards, the court did not actually engage 
in an agency analysis. The ""substantial control"" test used by the court in Caribbean Broadcasting System has been adopting by 
other courts and the test appears capable of being applied without resort to agency, veil piercing, and/or alter ego standards, "
1755,," see, e.g., Spanish Broad. Sys. of Fla., Inc. v. Clear Channel Commc'ns, Inc., 376 F.3d 1065 (11th Cir. 2004), which are applied 
differently under various state and federal laws. Although there may be reason to adopt such standards as part of the 
""substantial control"" analysis, the parties have not explained why any such standards are appropriate and/or necessary here."
1755,7," One of the cases relied extensively upon by CDK recognizes that the use of a parent company's email addresses supports a 
finding of substantial control, even though it is not sufficient by itself. whiteCryption Corp. v. Arxan Techs., Inc., 2016 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 78106, 2016 WL 3275944, at *11 (N.D. Cal. June 15, 2016) (""[B]eyond the use of [ ] associated email addresses, the acts 
appear to be more consistent with higher level policy and strategy decisions.""). "
1756,8," CDK argues that Intellectual Ventures and Nobody in Particular can be dismissed as wrongly decided because they did not 
reference the ""day-to-day"" analysis discussed in Caribbean Broadcasting System. [49 (CDK Reply), at 3.] However, both cases 
still analyzed whether and to what extent the parent companies exercised substantial control over their respective subsidiaries."
1756,9," MVSC also has submitted documents elaborating (albeit to a very limited extent) on its factual allegations relating to CDK's 
substantial control over CVR. For example, Bob Karp (CDK's North America President) was involved in discussions regarding at 
least one CVR executive's bonus grid and was praised for his ""deep level of engagement in CVR."" [Motor Vehicle Software 
Corporation v. CDK Global, Inc. et al., Case No. 18-cv-865, Dkt. 118, at 7-9.] "
1757,10," For the reasons discussed below, CDK and CVR can be treated as a single entity under Copperweld for the purposes of 
examining MVSC's antitrust claims. "
1758,11," In Authenticom, the Seventh Circuit was addressing a refusal-to-deal claim under Section 1. Although the court distinguished 
Aspen Skiing, which was a Section 2 claim, on that ground, that distinction was not the only basis for the court's decision. The 
court also focused on the fact that the history between the parties did not fit within the narrow exception established by Aspen 
Skiing, which also is true with respect to MVSC's Section 2 claims. "
1759,12," The Court takes no position on whether Plaintiff's conduct violates the CFAA and/or the CCCL. As the Court noted in ruling on 
the motions to dismiss in Authenticom, Inc. v. CDK Global, LLC (Case No. 18-cv-868), ""'authorization' here is 'a factual matter' 
and 'not properly before the Court based on the pleadings alone[.]"" In re Dealer Mgmt. Sys. Antitrust Litig., 313 F. Supp. 3d at 
949 (quoting Weingand v. Harland Fin. Sols., Inc., 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 123160, 2012 WL 3763640, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 29, 
2012))."
1759,13," Neither CDK nor CVR moved to dismiss MVSC's antitrust claims for failure to allege an antitrust injury. They did, however, 
adopt Reynolds's argument in their supplemental briefs. [120 (CDK Supp. Br.), at 7; 121 (CVR Supp. Br.), at 7.] Because MVSC "
1760,," adequately has alleged an antitrust injury, the Court need not address whether CDK and CVR properly joined Reynolds's 
motion. "
1761,14," Although Copperweld involved a conspiracy claim under Section 1, courts have held that Copperweld also applies to Section 2 
claims. See, e.g., Lenox MacLaren Surgical Corp. v. Medtronic, Inc., 847 F.3d 1221, 1234 (10th Cir. 2017); Fid. Nat'l Title Ins. 
Co. of New York v. Intercounty Nat'l Title Ins. Co., 161 F. Supp. 2d 876, 883 (N.D. Ill. 2001)."
1761,15," In support of its argument that Defendants are incapable of conspiring under the Copperweld doctrine, Defendant CVR cites a 
number of cases applying the Copperweld doctrine to partially owned subsidiaries. [46 (CVR Br.), at 3 n.3.] However, almost all 
of the cases cited involved one majority owner. Given that CDK has a majority interest in CVR and is alleged to be extensively 
involved in the operations of CVR, these cases support the argument that CDK and CVR may be considered a unified entity 
pursuant to Copperweld. Still, Plaintiff has alleged that CDK, CVR, and Reynolds conspired with each other. Defendants have 
only cited to one case— Stanislaus Food Prod. Co. v. USS-POSCO Indus., 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 92236. 2010 WL 3521979 
(E.D. Cal. Sept. 3, 2010) —in which the alleged misconduct involved a joint venture and its two parent companies. For the 
reasons discussed below, that case also is distinguishable."
1761,16," While this case still was in the Central District of California, Reynolds argued that the allegations in MVSC's first amended 
complaint regarding Reynolds's extensive control over CVR barred MVSC's Copperweld arguments. Because MVSC's first 
amended complaint was not verified, Reynolds has abandoned this argument because of Seventh Circuit caselaw only holds 
that an amended complaint cannot contradict an earlier verified complaint. [118 (Reynolds Supp. Br.), at 7 (citing Beal v. Beller, 
847 F.3d 897, 901 (7th Cir. 2017).] Regardless, although MVSC's first amended complaint included more allegations regarding 
Reynolds's control over CVR, it is not clear to the Court that those allegations directly undermine MVSC's Copperweld argument. "
1762,17," Defendants rely on Texaco Inc. v. Dagher, 547 U.S. 1, 126 S. Ct. 1276, 164 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2006) in support of their Copperweld 
argument. However, in Texaco, the Supreme Court did not actually address whether the defendants were capable of conspiring "
1763,," under Copperweld. Because the plaintiff only argued that defendants conduct was a per se violation of the Sherman Act, the 
Court limited its analysis to whether a joint venture's internal price setting was subject to a per se or rule of reason analysis."
1763,18," Given that the Court is denying Defendants' motion to dismiss MVSC's conspiracy claim under Copperweld, the Court does 
not address Plaintiff's alternative argument that Reynolds is judicially estopped from invoking Copperweld because Reynolds 
previously took the position that it was not a competitor in the CVR market. The Court notes, however, that it is not readily 
apparent that such position is inconsistent with the invocation of Copperweld. "
1769,1," The Court will discuss Defendant's arguments in a different order than they were presented. It seems intuitive to first discuss 
whether Plaintiffs have alleged a cognizable RICO injury, then discuss whether Plaintiffs have alleged a RICO violation (i.e. 
whether Bosch engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity; whether Bosch participated in the conduct of a RICO enterprise; 
whether there was a conspiracy to violate RICO). Finally, the Court will discuss whether Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged a 
causal connection between the violation and the injury. "
1775,2," If the current evidentiary record affirmatively disproves the Plaintiffs' claims, as Bosch contends, Bosch presumably would not 
hesitate to move for summary judgment."
1775,3," Bosch also argues briefly that Plaintiffs fail to plead the existence of a RICO conspiracy because they fail to plead intent or a 
substantive RICO violation. Because the Court disagrees with Bosch's conclusions on those two points (as discussed above), 
the Court also disagrees with Bosch's conclusion as to the RICO conspiracy. "
1780,1," Unless otherwise noted, the facts are derived from the Second Amended Complaint (Docket No. 51) (""SAC""). "
1786,2," The Pfizer court's discussion of the definition of ""drug"" recognized that it includes component parts of the final drug. Id. at 176 
(citing 21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)); see also United States v. Generix Drug Corp., 460 U.S. 453, 459, 103 S. Ct. 1298, 1301-02, 75 L. 
Ed. 2d 198 (1983) (""The term 'drug' is plainly intended throughout the Act to include entire drug products, complete with active 
and inactive ingredients.""). Recognizing component parts of a drug product is entirely consistent. "
1788,3," The court takes judicial notice of the underlying litigation. Maher v. Hyde, 272 F.3d 83, 86 n.3 (1st Cir. 2001) (holding that a 
court may take judicial notice of the docket of any court case). "
1789,4," This conclusion is supported by the fact that these facts were all known at the time of Sanofi I and Lilly raised some of the 
same arguments yet nevertheless proceeded towards trial and eventual settlement in Sanofi I. See Sanofi I Docket No. 149 at 3 
(""the injector pen part patents were never asserted against Lilly's marketed KwikPen product."")."
1789,5," The lawsuit with Merck is Sanofi-Aventis U.S. LLC v. Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., No. 16-00812 (D. Del. filed Sept. 16, 2016). 
The parties completed a five day bench trial on June 4, 2018 and have submitted post trial briefing. The lawsuit with Mylan is 
Sanofi-Aventis U.S. LLC v. Mylan N.V., No. 17-09105 (D.N.J. filed Oct. 24, 2017). The litigation is ongoing. "
1795,1," The named plaintiffs are James Contant, Sandra Lavender, Victor Hernandez, Martin-Han Tran, FX Primus Ltd., Carlos 
Gonzalez, Ugnius Matkus, Charles G. Hitchcock III, Jerry Jacobson, Tina Porter and Paul Vermillion."
1795,2," Defendants are Bank of America Corporation, Bank of America, N.A., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, The 
Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., Barclays Bank PLC, Barclays Capital Inc., BNP Paribas, BNP Paribas North America, Inc., 
BNP Paribas Securities Corp., BNP Paribas Prime Brokerage, Inc., Credit Suisse Group AG, Credit Suisse AG, Credit Suisse 
Securities (USA) LLC, Deutsche Bank AG, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Goldman, Sachs & 
Co., HSBC Bank plc, HSBC North America Holdings, Inc., HSBC Bank USA, N.A., HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., JPMorgan 
Chase & Co., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Morgan Stanley, Morgan Stanley & Co., LLC, Morgan Stanley & Co. International 
PLC, RBC Capital Markets, LLC, The Royal Bank of Scotland plc, RBS Securities Inc., Société Générale S.A., Standard 
Chartered Bank, UBS AG, UBS Group AG and UBS Securities, LLC. The Citigroup Defendants have settled."
1795,3," ""FX Instrument"" is defined in the Proposed Complaint and in the FOREX settlements as any FX spot transaction, forward, 
swap, future, option or any other FX transaction or instrument the trading or settlement value of which is related in any way to FX 
rates. "
1799,4," Defendants argue in a summary fashion that Plaintiffs' inability to trace the foreign currency they purchased in the retail market 
to defendants' conduct undermines Plaintiff's ability to meet the other AGC antitrust standing requirements, as it does the 
""directness"" requirement. See AGC, 459 U.S. at 540-45; Gelboim, 823 F.3d at 778. This argument fails for the same reasons as 
explained in the text; the Proposed Complaint plausibly alleges Plaintiffs' ability to trace the transactions at issue to the 
Defendants' wrongful conduct. "
1800,5," See also Fashion Two Twenty, Inc. v. Steinberg, 339 F. Supp. 836, 841 (E.D.N.Y. 1971) (""[A]n action alleging violations of the 
antitrust laws is a claim for injuries sustained, and therefore in the nature of a tort.""); accord Daniel v. Am. Bd. of Emergency 
Med., 988 F. Supp. 127, 231-32 (W.D.N.Y. 1997) (analyzing antitrust actions for purposes of the New York long-arm statute); 
Saratoga Harness Racing Inc. v. Veneglia, 897 F. Supp. 38, 44 n.8 (N.D.N.Y. 1995) (same). "
1802,6," In this regard, Plaintiffs should limit the definition of the California Class to those who purchased an FX Instrument in California, 
and not include those who were merely domiciled there. See In re TFT-LCD, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 121756, 2012 WL 3727221, 
at *3 (""for purposes of state law indirect purchaser claims, plaintiffs are deemed to be injured in the states where they agreed to 
pay inflated prices for products.""). "
1803,7," Defendants cite other cases in which the plaintiff also had not purchased anything, but that are less applicable to the facts at 
hand. See, e.g., Kertesz v. Net Transactions, Ltd., 635 F. Supp. 2d 1339, 1350 (S.D. Fla. 2009) (holding that a college student, 
whose photograph appeared in advertising on a pornographic website, was not a ""consumer"" who can sue under FDUTPA); 
Cannova v. Breckenridge Pharm., Inc., No. 08 Civ. 81145, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1168, 2009 WL 64337, at *3 (S.D. Fla. Jan. 9, 
2009) (dismissing an FDUTPA claim premised on wrongful termination of employment). "
1804,8," Only three NAs are left from the original four because Citibank, N.A., is no longer a party to the action."
1804,9," The BHCs and Foreign Defendants are not necessarily ""banks."" See Bankers Tr. Co. v. Basciano, 960 So. 2d 773, 779 (Fla. 
Dist. Ct. App. 2007) (""Nothing in FDUTPA suggests that bank subsidiaries, affiliates or agents are necessarily exempt from 
FDUTPA.""); see also State v. Commerce Commercial Leasing, LLC, 946 So. 2d 1253, 1258 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2007) (""It is quite 
a leap, however, to suggest that, just because an entity is a subsidiary of a bank, it is necessarily exempt from the Act.""); but see 
Sovereign Bonds Exch. LLC v. Fed. Republic of Germany, 899 F. Supp. 2d 1304, 1316 (S.D. Fla. 2010) (holding that German 
Banks cannot be sued under the FDUTPA because they ""are subject to federal regulation under the International Banking Act of 
1978, the Foreign Bank Supervision Enhancement Act of 1991, and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 . . . .""); Caban v. J.P. 
Morgan Chase & Co., 606 F. Supp. 2d 1361, 1371 (S.D. Fla. 2009) (dismissing FDUTPA claims against J.P. Morgan Chase & 
Co., a BHC ""because the statute does not apply to federally regulated banks such as Chase.""). "
1807,10," Because the Proposed Complaint asserts a consumer claim under Chapter 9 of the MCPA, it is unnecessary to address 
whether the alleged misconduct occurred ""primarily and substantially"" in Massachusetts, as that test applies only to business 
claims under Chapter 11 of the MCPA. See Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 93A, § 11 (""No action shall be brought or maintained 
under this section unless the actions and transactions constituting the alleged unfair method of competition or the unfair or 
deceptive act or practice occurred primarily and substantially within the commonwealth.""); see also Pare v. Northborough Capital 
Partners, LLC, 89 F. Supp. 3d 192, 193 (D. Mass. 2015) (""Unlike actions under § 9, an action brought under § 11 must allege 
unfair practices that occur primarily and substantially within the Commonwealth.""). "
1808,11," Defendants also cite Bache Halsey Stuart, Inc. v. Hunsucker, 38 N.C. App. 414, 420, 248 S.E.2d 567 (1978), which held that 
the NCUTPA could not be applied to claims for misconduct relating to futures contracts because any state regulation of 
commodities brokers was pre-empted by the Commodity Futures Trading Act. That case is inapplicable here, because the 
Sherman Act does not preempt NCUTPA. See California v. ARC Am. Corp., 490 U.S. 93, 101, 109 S. Ct. 1661, 104 L. Ed. 2d 
86(1989) (""the Court of Appeals erred in holding that the state indirect purchaser statutes are pre-empted"")."
1808,12, Plaintiffs should consider whether the definition of the North Carolina putative class should be revised. 
1810,1," For ease of reference, certain items from the record will be abbreviated as follows: ""DE    "" = Docket Entry in this case ""AC"" = Amended Complaint (DE 28) ""Def. Mot."" = Defendant's Memo of Law in Support of its Motion to Dismiss the Amended Complaint (DE 29-1) "
1811,," ""Pl. Opp."" = Plaintiff's Memo in Opposition to Defendant's Motion to Dismiss the Amended Complaint (DE 32) ""Def. Reply"" = Defendant's Reply Memo of Law in Further Support of its Motion to Dismiss the Amended Complaint (DE 33) "
1812,2," The Removed Complaint alleges, less specifically, that Dr. Ellison is located in California and that ABOS is headquartered in 
North Carolina. (DE no 1-1 ¶¶ 2, 3; DE 1-3, Civil Cover Sheet) "
1815,3," I note that the Amended Complaint adds an allegation of a New Jersey connection—i.e., that Dr. Ellison, a California 
practitioner, seeks to apply for privileges at New Jersey hospitals for reasons of professional growth. (AC ¶ 17) He alleges that 
three major hospital systems in New Jersey require board certification, so that if he applied for admitting privileges, he would 
anticipate rejection, which would be a blot on his record. I do not now rule on whether mat bare statement of intent, with no 
corroborating facts, suffices to establish the necessary connection to New Jersey. I iterate ray earlier admonition, however, that 
if such an allegation clears the hurdle of a motion to dismiss but is not supported by any objective evidence, it may make sense 
to consider now whether ""to file this lawsuit in a district where the defendant is incorporated and has its principal place of 
business, or in the alternative in a district where the acts complained of actually took place."" (DE 17 at p.5) Such a course might 
avoid miring the lawsuit in non-merits discovery and litigation pertaining to jurisdiction, venue, and the like. "
1817,1," By order filed October 22, 2018, the Court took the matter under submission."
1817,2," The Court understands the word ""specimen"" to refer to the ""mark as used on or in connection with the goods or services"" that 
is submitted for registration to the USPTO. See 37 C.F.R. § 2.56(a). "
1819,3," The other titles are ""$69 Trademark a Name Online — File Trademark in 3 Easy Steps,"" ""$69 Trademark a Logo Online — File 
Trademark in 3 Easy Steps,"" ""$69 Trademark Application — File Trademark in 3 Easy Steps,"" ""$69 Register Trademark Online 
— Fast Affordable Online Process,"" and ""Looking to Get a Trademark? — File Trademark in 3 Easy Steps."" (See id.)"
1819,4," As defendants note, the opinion does not identify the nature of the ""objective evidence"" on which it relied. "
1820,5," Both parties collectively refer to the statements discussed in the following section as TME's ""privacy-related statements."" (See 
Defs.' Mot. at 12:3; Pl.'s Opp. at 13:30.) "
1821,6," As the Court has not dismissed the entirety of RAPC's federal claim, the Court finds it appropriate to exercise supplemental 
jurisdiction over the state law claims. The Court notes, however, that RAPC's alternative allegations in support of diversity 
jurisdiction (see SAC ¶¶ 5, 7, 10) are insufficient for two reasons: (1) RAPC fails to allege the state in which it is ""incorporated,"" 
see 28 U.S.C. § 1332(c)(1); and (2) RAPC fails to allege Crabtree's ""state citizenship,"" see Kanter v. Warner-Lambert Co., 265 
F.3d 853, 857-58 (9th Cir. 2001)."
1821,7," In its opposition, RAPC clarifies that its § 17200 claim is not based on any ""misrepresentation"" (see Pl.'s Opp. at 18:6-16), e.g., 
any of the claimed misrepresentations upon which RAPC bases its Lanham Act claim. Consequently, the Court does not 
consider herein defendants' argument that RAPC has failed to allege reliance. "
1822,8," RAPC does not expressly allege that it lost any money or property as a result of the alleged submission of fraudulent 
specimens, nor is any such loss evident from the allegations in the SAC. "
1823,9," On a webpage titled ""Warning about unauthorized practice of law,"" the USPTO states that ""non-attorneys"" cannot perform the 
following acts: ""[c]onsulting with or giving advice to an applicant or registrant in contemplation of filing a trademark application or 
application-related document"" or ""[p]reparing or prosecuting an application."" (See SAC ¶ 40.a-b (quoting USPTO webpage at 
https://www.uspto.gov/trademark/trademark-updates-and-announcements/warning-unauthorized-lawpractice).) On a separate 
webpage in which the USPTO states it ""cannot give legal advice,"" it identifies the following acts, inter alia, that constitute ""legal 
advice"": ""[c]onducting pre-filing searches for potentially conflicting trademarks,"" ""[a]nalyzing or pre-approving documents before 
filing,"" and ""[a]dvising applicants on substantive examination issues, such as the acceptability of . . . classification of goods and 
services."" (See SAC ¶ 40.d-f) (quoting USPTO webpage at https://www.uspto.gov/learning-and-resources/support-centers/ 
trademark-assistance-center)); see also People v. Landlords Professional Services, 215 Cal. App. 3d 1599, 1608, 264 Cal. Rptr. 
548 (1989) (holding non-lawyers' assisting clients in completing legal forms does ""not amount to the practice of law as long as 
the service offered by [the non-lawyer] [is] merely clerical""). "
1824,10," In ""trademark matters,"" a ""practitioner"" is ""an individual who is an active member in good standing of the bar of the highest 
court of any State."" See 37 C.F.R. § 11.1 (defining ""practitioner"" and ""attorney""); see also 37 C.F.R. §§ 11.14(a), 5 U.S.C. § 
552(b). "
1825,11," RAPC argues that the Court should not apply the test set forth in Cal-Tech, but, rather, should apply ""the FTC Act section 5 
test."" (See Pl.'s Opp. at 24:23-24.) As the California Court of Appeal has explained, however, ""the section 5 test"" only applies to 
a § 17200 claim when a ""consumer"" alleges that a practice is ""unfair."" See Camacho v. Automobile Club of Southern California, 
142 Cal. App. 4th 1394, 1401-1406, 48 Cal. Rptr. 3d 770 (2006)."
1825,12," Defendants also argue that, in a § 17200 action, the plaintiff is not entitled to seek damages or an award of attorney's fees. 
Such argument, although a correct statement of the law, see Cel-Tech, 20 Cal. 4th at 179, is unavailing, as RAPC does not seek 
such relief for its § 17200 claim, but only for its Lanham Act claim. "
1826,13, The Court's July 19 order did not address any of the deficiencies as to which leave to amend will be afforded. 
1828,1," During the course of this long-pending litigation, CME merged with CBOT. The new, merged entity created in 2007 is named 
CME Group."
1828,2," This case was originally set for trial on June 4, 2018. On April 27, 2018, after reviewing the parties' summary judgment motions, 
the Court vacated the trial date and explained that it would ""issue a written opinion on the pending motions for summary 
judgment."" R. 753."
1828,3," The Court disregards all inappropriate legal arguments in the parties' L.R. 56.1 statements. Plaintiffs' responses to defendants' 
statements of fact and plaintiffs' statement of additional facts in particular are rife with ""legal and factual argument that must be 
disregarded."" Rao v. Gondi, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 86152, 2017 WL 2445131, at *2 (N.D. Ill. June 5, 2017); accord Ortega v. 
Chicago Pub. Sch. of the Bd. of Educ. of the City of Chicago, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 84455, 2015 WL 4036016, at *3 (N.D. Ill. 
June 30, 2015) (disregarding ""argumentative language as it is improper""). The Court also disregards numerous facts raised by 
both parties that are not ""material to the movant's motion."" Wilbern v. Culver Franchising Sys., 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 130888, 
2015 WL 5722825, at *17 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 29, 2015). And the Court disregards portions of plaintiffs' statement of additional facts 
that do not contain ""specific references to the affidavits, parts of the record, and other supporting materials relied upon to support 
the facts set forth in that paragraph."" L.R. 56.1. Finally, the Court notes that both parties run afoul of the rule that each paragraph 
of a L.R. 56.1 statement be ""short"" and ""contain only one or two individual allegations."" Malec v. Sanford, 191 F.R.D. 581, 583 
(N.D. Ill. 2000). Plaintiffs in particular have violated this rule, including through numerous paragraphs in their statement of 
additional facts that span a page to page-and-a-half of single spaced text, with large numbers of exhibits cited in each. See R. 
742. "
1830,4," In June 2002, the CFTC issued a report describing concerns among industry participants that ""competition at the exchange and 
clearing organization level . . . had not materialized."" Id. ¶ 31. The CFTC identified ""two particular characteristics of the market 
structure of the futures industry . . . as possible causes: [1] the lack of fungibility of products across exchanges and [2] the lack of 
common clearing."" Id. With respect to fungibility of products across exchanges, the CFTC acknowledged the potential benefits of 
such an approach, but also noted that ""the development of new products can require a significant expenditure of capital"" and 
""[m]andating fungibility could decrease the potential reward and therefore decrease the incentive for innovation."" Id. ¶ 32. With 
respect to common clearing, the report mentioned potential benefits, and also noted: ""Commentators suggested that common "
1831,," clearing could work to heighten competition between exchanges and clearing organizations. However, mandating common 
clearing would have the effect of subjecting clearing organizations to one another's credit risk involuntarily."" Id. ¶ 33. The report 
observed that neither the CEA nor CFTC rules require the CFTC to mandate fungibility or common clearing, but the CFTC 
intended to organize a roundtable with industry participants to discuss these issues. Id. ¶ 34. The CFTC held that roundtable and 
heard testimony from industry representatives on August 1, 2002. Id. ¶ 35. They did not change the model. The CFTC and SEC 
evaluated these issues again and came to the same conclusion in an October 2009 report, explaining that ""futures exchanges 
ordinarily do not treat contracts listed across markets as 'fungible'"" because there are ""decreased incentives of a futures 
exchange to innovate product listings and potential exposure of one clearinghouse to the credit risks of another."" Id. ¶ 38. The 
2009 report further explained that ""permitting listing of replica contracts on competing exchanges facilitates 'free-riding' on the 
first exchange's investment and may decrease incentives favoring innovation."" Id. "
1832,5," A large volume of U.S. Treasury futures were set to expire in late-March 2004. Id. ¶ 13. USFE anticipated that in the month of 
February 2004, some customers would close out these positions on CBOT, reopen them on USFE, and then trade that open 
interest on USFE. Id. This timeline made the date of USFE's launch important. Id. ¶ 14."
1832,6," A year later, in November 2004, the CFTC ""eliminate[d] the presumption of automatic fast-track review of applications and 
replace[d] it with the presumption that all applications [would] be reviewed pursuant to the statutory 180-day timeframe and 
procedures specified in Section 6(a) of the [CEA]"" in order ""to ensure a comprehensive review of applications and to meet other 
public policy objectives."" R. 731 ¶ 46. "
1850,7," Defendants also say USFE selected BOTCC as its preferred clearing provider before learning of the CBOT-CME clearing link, 
meaning that plaintiffs did not suffer antitrust injury from not being able to clear through CME. See Paddock Publ'ns, Inc. v. Chi. 
Tribune Co., 103 F.3d 42, 47 (7th Cir. 1996) (affirming dismissal where plaintiff ""never tried to make a better offer,"" explaining 
that ""[plaintiff] should try to outbid [defendants] in the marketplace, rather than to outmaneuver them in court""). The Court does 
not find it appropriate to grant judgment as a matter of law on this alternative basis. None of the exhibits defendants cite 
conclusively shows that USFE selected BOTCC as its preferred provider before learning of the clearing link. R. 731 ¶¶ 7-8, 12-
15. "
1851,8," Plaintiffs also say that defendants ""ignored"" their theory that defendants interfered with contractual dealings with potential 
customers in addition to the contractual dealings with BOTCC and the NFA. R. 732 at 53. But plaintiffs do not cite any evidence 
related to customer contract interference to support that theory. See id. Nor, as discussed above, have plaintiffs found any 
prospective customer to testify about alleged threats. "
