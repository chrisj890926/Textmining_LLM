21,1," Zummo named the Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection Public Vehicle Operations Division as the original 
defendant. The Court entered an order on December 27, 2017, stating that ""[s]ummons shall issue to the City of Chicago, which 
is the proper Defendant, not one of its departments."" R. 9; see also R. 14."
21,2," This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over the federal claims in this case under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343. It has 
supplemental jurisdiction over the Illinois law claims under 28 U.S.C. § 1367. "
22,3," Citations to the docket are indicated by ""R."" followed by the docket entry and page number. Zummo has attached numerous 
materials and addendums to his Complaint. For the sake of clarity, the Court will refer to all materials submitted under docket 
entry 10 as the Complaint, citing page numbers in the order that materials appear in the docket entry."
22,4," At one point in the Complaint, Zummo seems to allege that his medallion and license did not expire before the end of 2017. 
Compl. at 11-12. (""I knew I could no longer drive my taxicab after December 31st, 2017.""). But later in the Complaint, Zummo 
seems to concede that his license and medallion had expired. Id. at 26 (""The fine/citation may have applied technically, but the 
impoundment of my vehicle was extremely excessive.""). Ultimately, whether or not Zummo pleads that the license and medallion 
were expired at the time his car was impounded does not matter because hearing notices attached to the City's filings 
demonstrate that Zummo participated in a hearing where he could contest the matter. Def. Second Reply Exh. A. "
23,5," The Court may take judicial notice of the Department of Administrative Hearings docket and administrative orders as they are 
matters of public record. See Milwaukee Police Ass'n v. Flynn, 863 F.3d 636, 640 (7th Cir. 2017)."
23,6," Zummo initially failed to file a response to the City's motion to dismiss by the original deadline, but the City still filed a reply at 
the reply-brief deadline. Afterwards, the Court extended the time for Zummo to respond and allowed the City to file a second 
reply. R. 29, Minute Entry 06/04/2018. "
24,7," This Opinion uses (cleaned up) to indicate that internal quotation marks, alterations, and citations have been omitted from 
quotations. See Jack Metzler, Cleaning Up Quotations, 18 Journal of Appellate Practice and Process 143 (2017). "
28,8," Although Zummo does not actually use the word ""antitrust"" in his complaint, as noted above, the Court must construe pro se 
complaints liberally, Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94, 127 S. Ct. 2197, 167 L. Ed. 2d 1081 (2007), and the facts alleged in 
his complaint are sufficient to put the City on notice of an antitrust claim."
28,9," The City also argues that it is immune from liability under the state action doctrine. Def. Br. at 10 (citing Parker v. Brown, 317 
U.S. 341, 63 S. Ct. 307, 87 L. Ed. 315 (1946)). The Court need not definitively decide this issue because it holds that Zummo 
does not state a claim on the merits. But it is worth noting that there is some reason to question the City's sovereign immunity 
defense because no state statute gives the City express authority to regulate TNPs beyond home rule authority. See Campbell 
v. City of Chicago, 823 F.2d 1182, 1184 (7th Cir. 1987) (holding cities subject to sovereign immunity defense only if (1) the 
challenged conduct was authorized by the state legislature and (2) if the anticompetitive effects were a foreseeable result of the 
authorization). Although the City relies on Campbell, where the Illinois legislature gave municipalities the express authority to 
""regulate cabmen,"" id., the state has not given the City any ""clearly articulated and affirmative state policy"" beyond home-rule 
authority to regulate TNPs. Cmty. Communs Co. v. City of Boulder, Colo., 455 U.S. 40, 51, 102 S. Ct. 835, 70 L. Ed. 2d 810 
(1982) (holding home-rule authority to be insufficient to qualify as an authorization by the state to engage in conduct that 
influences competition); Transportation Network Providers Act, 625 ILCS 57/32 (limiting ""concurrent exercise by home rule units 
of powers""). "
29,10," Zummo has also listed snippets of conclusory allegations in his Complaint that either do not constitute legal causes of action 
or fall short of factual allegations necessary to state a claim. Compl. at 30-32 (accusing City of ""severe intentionally [sic] 
malicious malfeasance,"" ""entrapment,"" ""economic duress,"" and causing ""financial hardship""). "
38,1," The parties allege that the arbitration provisions in the prior license agreements delegate the question of arbitrability to the 
arbitrator. In such instances, the Fifth Circuit sends this threshold inquiry to arbitration unless the assertion of arbitrability is 
""wholly groundless."" "
41,2," The Supreme Court recently granted a petition for writ of certiorari to decide whether a court must nonetheless submit the 
question of arbitrability to the arbitrator even if it finds the assertion of arbitrability ""wholly groundless."" Archer and White Sales, 
Inc. v. Henry Schein, Inc., 878 F.3d 488, 492 (5th Cir. 2017), cert. granted, 138 S. Ct. 2678, 201 L. Ed. 2d 1071 (2018) (internal 
citations omitted). "
43,3," HTC cites In re Garza, 90 F. App'x 730, 735 (5th Cir. 2004) for the proposition that ""[t]he Fifth Circuit recognized that 
'severance of a single cause of action into two parts is never proper and should not be granted."" (Dkt. No. 151 at 8.) That case 
applied Texas state law and did not concern severing arbitrable claims from non-arbitrable claims and is therefore 
distinguishable."
43,4," The Supreme Court has expressly rejected the ""doctrine of intertwining,"" which gave courts discretion to deny arbitration if the 
arbitrable and non-arbitrable claims arose ""out of the same transaction"" and were ""sufficiently intertwined factually and legally."" 
Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc. v. Byrd, 470 U.S. 213, 216, 105 S. Ct. 1238, 84 L. Ed. 2d 158 (1985). "
54,1," Defendant is not moving to dismiss the following claims: The First Claim, which seeks an injunction under section 16 of the 
Clayton Act for violations of sections 1, 2, and 3 of the Sherman Act; the Fourth Claim, which seeks disgorgement of the excess 
profits Allergan earned under California's unjust enrichment law; and the Fifth Claim, which seeks a declaratory judgment that 
Allergan's conduct violated the Sherman Act."
54,2," Allergan does not challenge EPPs' claims for violation of the antitrust laws of Arizona, California, the District of Columbia, 
Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, and Vermont. "
58,3," EPPs note that they sent a letter to the Hawaii Attorney General on the same day that the Consolidated Complaint was filed, 
which was approximately four months after Allergan was served with their first complaint. This action does not comply with the 
statute."
58,4," Justice Scalia's plurality opinion in Shady Grove—which adopted a bright-line rule that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 
always apply—garnered only four votes. Justice Stevens's narrower concurrence therefore governs, under the rule announced in 
Marks v. United States: ""When a fragmented Court decides a case and no single rationale explaining the result enjoys the 
assent of five Justices, the holding of the Court may be viewed as that position taken by those Members who concurred in the 
judgments on the narrowest grounds."" 430 U.S. 188, 193, 97 S. Ct. 990, 51 L. Ed. 2d 260 (1977) (internal quotation marks 
omitted). See, e.g., In re Digital Music Antitrust Litig., 812 F. Supp. 2d 390, 415 (S.D.N.Y. 2011) (finding that Justice Stevens' 
concurrence is the controlling opinion by which interpreting courts are bound); In re Wellbutrin Antitrust Litig., 756 F. Supp. 2d 
670, 675 (F.D. Pa. 2010) (same). "
60,5," It is undisputed that ""person"" is defined to include corporate entities, associations, and agents. Mo. Rev. Stat. § 407.010(5). 
Allergan contends only that the statute does not apply to plaintiffs because they did not purchase Restasis® primarily for their 
own purposes. "
64,6," Because I find that EPPs lack standing, I do not consider defendant's alternative argument that plaintiffs' VCFA claim must be 
dismissed because they have not alleged that Allergan's misrepresentations caused them to buy Restasis®. "
66,1," On July 8, 2018, Hu Honua and HEP entered into a binding settlement, see ECF No. 179, and Hu Honua dismissed claims 
against HEP with prejudice, see ECF No. 177. Although HEP had filed its own motion to dismiss the SAC, it withdrew that 
motion and others in conjunction with the settlement, see ECF Nos. 174, 175. This Order thus focuses solely on NextEra's 
motion. Similarly, Hu Honua and co-Defendants Hawaiian Electric Industries (""HEI""), Hawaiian Electric Company (""HECO"") and HELCO 
(collectively, ""the Hawaiian Electric Defendants"") previously reached a settlement in May 2017 in conjunction with a renegotiated 
PPA, as Hu Honua completes construction of its power plant. See ECF Nos. 88, 122. Consummation of the settlement with the 
Hawaiian Electric Defendants is still awaiting final completion of the approval process involving the Hawaii Public Utilities 
Commission (""PUC"") and a related state court appeal, Life of the Land v. Public Utilities Comm'n, et al., App. No. SCOT-17-
0000630 (Haw. Sup. Ct.). "
67,2," The court only considered Count One of the FAC as to NextEra as a claim for conspiracy to monopolize. See Hu Honua 
Bioenergy, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8835, 2018 WL 491780, at *8. To the extent the FAC asserted claims for monopolization and 
attempted monopolization (as opposed to conspiracy to monopolize), the court dismissed those claims with prejudice for two 
reasons. First, NextEra (a Florida utility) was never a competitor with Hu Honua in the relevant market (the Big Island). See, e.g., 
Name.Space, Inc. v. Internet Corp. for Assigned Names & Numbers, 795 F.3d 1124, 1131 (9th Cir. 2015); Spanish Broad. Sys. 
of Fla., Inc. v. Clear Channel Commc'ns, Inc., 376 F.3d 1065, 1075 (11th Cir. 2004). And second, Hu Honua conceded that it 
was only asserting a conspiracy-based claim. See Hu Honua Bioenergy, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8835, 2018 WL 491780, at *8 
(citing ECF No. 109, Pl.'s Opp'n at 34-35 n.8). The SAC again appears to plead monopolization and attempted monopolization 
claims, and the claims are again dismissed with prejudice for the same reasons stated in the January 19th Order. Hu Honua 
need not have repleaded those claims if it was seeking to preserve them for appeal. See, e.g., Lacey v. Maricopa Cty., 693 F.3d 
896, 928 (9th Cir. 2012) (en banc) (""For claims dismissed with prejudice and without leave to amend, we will not require that 
they be repled in a subsequent amended complaint to preserve them for appeal.""). In this regard, NextEra points to cases indicating that a conspiracy to monopolize claim also fails if the defendant was not a 
competitor in the relevant market. See, e.g., Portney v. CIBA Vision Corp., 593 F. Supp. 2d 1120, 1128 (C.D. Cal. 2008) (""It is 
axiomatic in antitrust law that a defendant may not be found liable for monopolizing or attempting or conspiring to monopolize a 
market unless that defendant is a competitor in the relevant market and his conduct creates a dangerous probability that he will 
gain a dominant share of the market."") (quoting Transphase Sys. v. S. Cal. Edison Co., 839 F. Supp. 711, 717 (C.D. Cal. 1993) 
(emphasis added)). But other authority disagrees, reasoning that in some circumstances a non-competitor can conspire to 
monopolize a market. See Spanish Broad. Sys., 376 F.3d at 1078 n.10 (""Nothing in our case law suggests that a conspiracy [to 
monopolize] must be limited solely to market participants so long as the conspiracy also involves a market participant and the 
non-participant has an incentive to join the conspiracy."") (citation omitted). Because Hu Honua's conspiracy to monopolize claim 
fails for several other reasons, the court need not decide whether it also fails on this ground. "
70,3," ""[S]ection 210(a) of PURPA directed the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ('FERC') to promulgate rules mandating that 
electric utilities purchase energy from QFs."" Allco Renewable Energy Ltd. v. Mass. Elec. Co., 875 F.3d 64, 67 (1st Cir. 2017) 
(citing 16 U.S.C. § 824a-3(a)). ""In accordance with this directive, FERC promulgated regulations requiring utilities to purchase 
electricity from QFs 'at a rate equal to the utility's full avoided cost.'"" Id. (citations omitted). ""Crucially, given section 210's 
purpose, the avoided cost rate 'usually exceeds the market price for wholesale power.' Additionally, section 210(f) of PURPA 
instructs state regulatory authorities to implement these FERC rules."" Id. (quoting Portland GE v. FERC, 854 F.3d 692, 695, 428 
U.S. App. D.C. 340 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (other citations omitted)). "
72,4," ""[A] Court may take judicial notice of matters of public record without converting a motion to dismiss into a motion for summary 
judgment."" Khoja v. Orexigen Therapeutics, Inc., 899 F.3d 988, 999 (9th Cir. 2018) (quoting Lee v. City of L.A., 250 F.3d 668, 
689 (9th Cir. 2001)). Moreover, the court can review the PPA application under the incorporation-by-reference doctrine because 
the SAC refers extensively to the application (see, e.g., SAC ¶¶ 65 to 67). See Khoja, 899 F.3d at 1002 (""[A] defendant may 
seek to incorporate a document into the complaint 'if the plaintiff refers extensively to the document or the document forms the 
basis of the plaintiff's claim.'"") (quoting United States v. Ritchie, 342 F.3d 903, 907 (9th Cir. 2003))."
72,5," HAR Chapter 6-74, entitled ""Standards for Small Power Production and Cogeneration,"" among other things, (1) defines 
qualifying facilities under FERC's PURPA regulations, 18 C.F.R. Part 292, see HAR § 6-74-1; and (2) implements ""arrangements 
between electric utilities and [QFs] under Section 210 of [PURPA], 16 U.S.C. § 824a-3,"" see HAR §§ 6-74-15 to -28. This 
Chapter thus executes FERC's mandate to Hawaii (as with all other states) to implement FERC's rules requiring utilities to 
purchase electricity from QFs ""at a rate equal to the utility's full avoided cost,"" Allco Renewable Energy Ltd., 875 F.3d at 67 
(citations omitted), where ""section 210(f) of PURPA instructs state regulatory authorities to implement these FERC rules."" Id. 
(citations omitted)). "
73,6," HAR § 6-75-15(c) provides: If the electric utility and qualifying facility fail to reach an agreement on the rate or terms of purchase within seventy-five 
days after [*21]  the qualifying facility first offers to sell energy or capacity to the electric utility, the electric utility, within 
fourteen days, shall submit a petition to the commission requesting a hearing on the matter. If the electric utility fails to 
submit the petition within the prescribed time period, the qualifying facility may petition the commission for a hearing on the 
matter. Upon the application of the electric utility or the qualifying facility and for good cause, the commission may waive or 
modify the time periods prescribed in this subsection. In turn, § 6-75-15(e) provides: When a petition is filed pursuant to subsection (c), the commission may: (1) Dismiss the petition, if it finds that the qualifying facility's offer is incomplete in any material respect; (2) Resolve the differences between the parties; or (3) Provide such directions, instructions, or rulings as appropriate, and order the parties to resume negotiations. "
81,1," The requirements for certification listed in the 2002-03 NCAA Bowl Handbook include, inter alia, exceeding a minimum amount 
of ticket sales, the implementation of a gross receipt sharing policy under which the institutions participating in the bowl each 
receive a minimum payout of $750,000, the performance of financial audits, the submission of a letter of credit, and compliance 
with certification application dates, fees, and procedures."
81,2," On December 27, 2017, the ICA issued an order granting Aloha Sports, Inc.'s motion to substitute Dane S. Field, Trustee of the 
Bankruptcy Estate of Aloha Sports, Inc., for Aloha Sports, Inc. as plaintiff-appellant. "
82,3, Daw again participated in the meeting by phone.
82,4," An NCAA press release regarding the Subcommittee's decisions for the 2003 season bowls provided: ""The committee did not 
recertify the Seattle Bowl, due to financial issues and failure to adhere to administrative requirements."""
82,5," In the version of the Handbook released the following year, the provision was revised to state, ""If a sponsoring agency fails to 
meet the certification requirements, it may either be put on probation for one year or be decertified for the next bowl season."" 
(Emphasis added) "
83,6," HRS § 480-2 (2008) provides in relevant part as follows: (a) Unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are 
unlawful. . . . (e) Any person may bring an action based on unfair methods of competition declared unlawful by this section."
83,7, The Honorable Karen S.S. Ahn presided.
83,8," The other grounds alleged in the second amended complaint to be unfair methods of competition in violation of HRS § 480-2 
were as follows: (1) requiring Aloha Sports to pay $75,000 or 75% of gross bowl revenues in equal proportion to participating teams; (2) 
arbitrarily penalizing sponsoring agencies for not meeting the payout requirements; (3) discriminatorily withdrawing 
certification of the San Francisco Bowl, refusing to recertify the Aloha Bowl, and decertifying the Seattle Bowl despite 
substantial compliance with the requirements for maintaining certification and receiving recertification; (4) imposing upon 
Aloha Sports unreasonable and arbitrary standards of conduct, and (5) terminating and refusing to renew Aloha Sports' San 
Francisco and Seattle Bowls without good cause and in violation of the NCAA's terms and standards applicable to all bowls. 
These grounds are largely not relevant to this appeal, and all references to Aloha Sports' UMOC claim refer to only the 
alleged HRS § 480-2 violation in Subsection 23(f) of the second amended complaint [***9]  based on the NCAA's purported 
blocking of Aloha Sports' transfer of ownership to Pro Sports."
83,9," The Honorable Karl K. Sakamoto presided over the jury trial, as well as a preceding motion granting Aloha Sports leave to file a 
third amended complaint excluding any claims related to the Aloha/San Francisco Bowl. The third amended complaint otherwise 
was identical to the second amended complaint."
83,10," The transcript of the September 8, 2011 hearing reflects the following: [ALOHA SPORTS]: Correct. Just for the record, your Honor, the sole claim on which we're proceeding we can abandon all 
other claims which may have been pled. The sole claim in which we're proceeding [***10]  is intentional interference with 
prospective business advantage. That's it. So all the antitrust claims, the franchise claims, the claim under 480-2 all -- all 
are abandoned. . . . [ALOHA SPORTS]: Excuse me. We don't think on the record we can satisfy the test that the Hawaii Supreme Court 
established with the Davis case, which converted 480-2 which was a redundant antitrust statute, but I don't think we can do 
that, so that's— "
84,," THE COURT: Right. It makes it very, very difficult to satisfy proof especially without an expert. . . . [NCAA]: So it's clear that the theory of contract based on the handbook is also out? [ALOHA SPORTS]: Correct. The singular claims prospective advantage. THE COURT: Right. That's -- [NCAA]: So we're down to one cause of action interference with respective [sic] economic advantage. THE COURT: That's correct. [NCAA]: And everything else is dismissed. THE COURT: That's correct."
84,11," It appears that section 3 of the Final Judgment mistakenly refers to the ""2/26/08 Dismissal Order"" as the ""2/28/08 Dismissal 
Order."""
84,12," Aloha Sports also appealed from the Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Defendant The National Collegiate Athletic 
Association's Motion for Attorneys' Fees and Costs, Filed January 31, 2012 (Attorney's Fee Order)."
84,13," The ICA's memorandum opinion can be found at Aloha Sports Inc. v. NCAA, No. CAAP-12-0000512, 2013 Haw. App. LEXIS 
616, 2013 WL 5823893 (Haw. App. Oct. 30, 2013)."
84,14, The ICA also vacated the Attorney's Fee Order and affirmed all other circuit court rulings at issue.
84,15, The Honorable Karl K. Sakamoto also presided over the circuit court proceedings on remand. 
85,16," The full title of the court's order is ""Order Granting Defendant The National Collegiate Athletic Association's Motion For 
Judgment On The Pleadings, Or In The Alternative, For Summary Judgment On The Sole Remaining Claim For Unfair 
Competition Alleged In Plaintiff's Third Amended Complaint, Filed May 27, 2011, Filed September 25, 2014 [Civ. No. 06-1-1832-
10 (June 9, 2015)]."" "
86,17," The final judgment also included an order granting in part and denying in part a motion for reinstatement of the Attorney's Fee 
Order, filed August 4, 2015 (Order to Reinstate Attorney's Fee Order)."
86,18," The ICA's SDO can be found at Aloha Sports Inc. v. The NCAA, 141 Haw. 143, 406 P.3d 366, 2017 WL 4890131 (Haw. App. 
2017), as corrected (Jan. 11, 2018)."
86,19," The ICA specifically cited the 2001-02 Handbook in its SDO, which did not contain the conflicting provision added in the 2002-
03 Handbook that stated nonfulfillment of certification requirements would be punished by probation. See supra text 
accompanying note 5."
86,20," The ICA also affirmed the ""Judgment"" entered on August 11, 2015; the Order to Reinstate Attorney's Fees Order; and the 
Attorney's Fee Order. "
87,21," Aloha Sports also challenges on certiorari the ICA's affirmation of the circuit court's Order to Reinstate Attorney's Fees Order 
and the Attorney's Fee Order."
87,22," In this case, the record indicates that the NCAA's motion was filed after the close of discovery. It is noted that HN3[
] the 
movant's burden is generally greater when a party seeks summary judgment before discovery has concluded. See Ralston v. 
Yim, 129 Hawai'i 46, 48, 61, 292 P.3d 1276, 1278, 1291 (2013) (""[I]n general, a summary judgment movant cannot merely point 
to the non-moving party's lack of evidence to support its initial burden of production if discovery has not concluded."" (citing 
French v. Hawaii Pizza Hut, Inc., 105 Hawai'i 462, 472, 99 P.3d 1046, 1056 (2004)))."
87,23," HRS § 480-2 (2008) in relevant part provides as follows: (a) Unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are 
unlawful. . . . (e) Any person may bring an action based on unfair methods of competition declared unlawful by this section."
87,24," HRS § 480-13 provides in relevant part as follows: (a) Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c), any person [***20]  who is injured in the person's business or property by 
reason of anything forbidden or declared unlawful by this chapter: (1) May sue for damages sustained by the person and, if the judgment is for the plaintiff, the plaintiff shall be awarded 
a sum not less than $1,000 or threefold damages by the plaintiff sustained, whichever sum is the greater . . . . (Emphasis added.) "
88,25," HN6[
] In evaluating a motion for summary judgment, we apply a burden-shifting framework under which the moving party 
bears the initial burden of demonstrating that no genuine issue of material fact exists with respect to the essential elements of 
the claim and that the undisputed facts entitle the party to judgment as a matter of law. See Gurrobat v. HTH Corp., 133 Hawai'i 
1, 14, 323 P.3d 792, 805 (2014). Where, as here, the non-movant bears the burden of proof at trial, the movant may meet its 
initial burden by either ""(1) presenting evidence negating an element of the non-movant's claim, or (1) demonstrating that the 
non-movant will be unable to carry his or her burden of proof at trial."" Ralston, 129 Hawai'i at 60-61, 292 P.3d at 1290-91 (citing 
French, 105 Hawai'i at 470-72, 99 P.3d at 1054-56)). ""Only once the moving party has satisfied its initial burden of production 
does the burden shift to the non-moving party to show specific facts that present a genuine issue for trial."" Gurrobat, 133 Hawai'i 
at 14, 323 P.3d at 805. In this case, the circuit court found that the NCAA had met its initial burden and that Aloha Sports then failed to present sufficient 
evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact. Because Aloha Sports' arguments before this court focus on the sufficiency of 
the evidence it presented, the circuit court's finding that the NCAA met its initial burden appears to be uncontested."
88,26," HN9[
] Although the standard to prove a HRS § 480-2 violation and the elements to establish a tortious interference with economic advantage may seem similar in that the latter requires that a plaintiff intended to either pursue ""an improper objective 
of harming the plaintiff or use[] wrongful means,"" Hawaii Med. Ass'n v. Hawaii Med. Serv. Ass'n, Inc., 113 Hawai'i 77, 116, 148 
P.3d 1179, 1218 (2006) (quoting Omega Envtl., Inc. v. Gilbarco, Inc., 127 F.3d 1157, 1166 (9th Cir. 1997)), the elements of the 
two claims are not identical. See infra, § III.C. "
90,27," The third element is proof of damages. Gurrobat, 133 Hawai'i at 23, 323 P.3d at 814. Neither the circuit court in granting 
summary judgment nor the ICA in affirming the circuit court based its decision on the absence of a showing of proof of damages. 
Accordingly, since this issue is undisputed and was not relied upon by the circuit court, we conclude that Aloha Sports raised a 
disputed fact as to this element also. "
91,28," Additionally, the U.S. Supreme Court has held that under federal anti-trust law, harm to a single business may suffice to 
establish an anti-trust violation. Klor's, Inc. v. Broadway-Hale Stores, Inc., 359 U.S. 207, 213, 79 S. Ct. 705, 3 L. Ed. 2d 741 
(1959) (""As such [a boycott by a combination of manufactures and dealers] is not to be tolerated merely because the victim is 
just one merchant whose business is so small that his destruction makes little difference to the economy."")."
91,29," As noted, the ICA did not address the circuit court's holdings on waiver, judicial estoppel, or collateral estoppel. However, the 
NCAA requested at oral argument that this court address these holdings if we were to conclude that there were disputed facts 
regarding the elements of a UMOC claim and that summary judgment had thus been improperly granted on this ground. Oral 
Argument at 00:36:50, Field v. The NCAA (No. SCWC-15-663), "
92,30," The circuit court held that Aloha Sports impliedly waived the UMOC claim at the pre-trial hearing because it was more difficult 
to prove than the other HRS § 480-2 claims that it expressly waived. Our precedent does not make a distinction between an 
implied and express waiver in this regard; without a then-existing right to proceed on the UMOC claim, Aloha Sports was not 
capable of waiving the claim by implication. See Coon, 98 Hawai'i at 261, 47 P.3d at 376. "
93,31," The Special Verdict Form stated, ""Did Plaintiff ASI prove by a preponderance of the evidence that Defendant NCAA tortiously

premature at this early stage of litigation. See generally Gelboim, 823 F.3d. Cf. Starr, 592 F.3d at 325 (holding that in case

which the employees worked. The amended complaint sufficiently alleges aiding and abetting liability as well. Defendant banks allegedly knew that efforts to 
manipulate BBSW were widespread and shared information with one another to coordinate transactions and align interests. In 
addition, the banks facilitated other banks' manipulative trading by providing them with ""ammunition"" in order to be able sell off 
more Prime Bank Bills during a given Fixing Period. These acts of affirmative assistance and indications of knowledge and intent

the district court considered defendants who were producers, refiners and traders of Brent crude oil that allegedly entered into

most of the derivatives in that case were not priced by reference to the allegedly manipulated rate. Id. at 310. Here, in contrast,

if a document is not attached to a complaint, it may be incorporated by reference into a complaint if the plaintiff refers extensively 
to the document or the document forms the basis of the plaintiff's claim.""). Plaintiff does not dispute this documents authenticity. 
It merely objects that it was neither extensively relied on in the complaint nor formed the ""entire basis"" of Plaintiff's claims. 
However, the Rankings form the basis for Plaintiff's alleged Elite College Submarket. FAC ¶ 18 (""'Elite College' means a top-
ranked College (e.g., by U.S. News & World Report as a top-50 national university or a top-50 liberal arts college)."").

Plaintiff's claim under the rule of reason. Though horizonal restraints can—under some circumstances—be unlawful per se, the 
Court finds that analyzing Plaintiff's First and Second Claims under the rule of reason is likely most appropriate in this case, 
which involves an otherwise lawful joint venture involving certain horizontal restraints. See Am. Needle, 560 U.S. at 203 (""When 
'restraints on competition are essential if the product is to be available at all,' per se rules of illegality are inapplicable, and 
instead the restraint must be judged according to the flexible Rule of Reason.""); NCAA, 468 U.S. at 100-01 (declining to apply "
217,," the per se rule because the ""case involve[d] an industry in which horizontal restraints on competition [were] essential if the 
product [was] to be available at all""); see also Areeda & Hovenkamp ¶ 1478 (noting that when single-entity claims are rejected, 
courts generally reject per se illegality as well)."
217,4," To the extent that Defendant's argument hinges on the difference between limiting what the school can charge students 
applications and what the provider can charge the College for its services, the effect of this difference is a factual issue that 
cannot be resolved at this stage in the proceedings. "
224,5," The litany of cases cited by Defendant on this point are inapposite: they were all decided either on a motion to summary 
judgment or after trial. See Def. Mot. Dismiss 30-31 (citing cases). "
231,1, The court has attached Page 3 of BladeRoom's presentation as Ex. 1.

240,3," Specifically, the sales at issue here involve safety catheters, safety syringes, and conventional syringes (Doc. 52, pp. 2-3)."
240,4," Penalty pricing rebate provisions require a provider to purchase a certain volume of products based on its Becton purchases 
from the year before (Doc. 52, pp. 11-12). For instance, a net dealer contract may state that a provider must make purchases 
equal to at least 80% of its purchases from the previous year (Id.). In return, the provider pays a lower cost per unit (Id.). The 
provider realizes the cost-savings through an end-of-year rebate payment (Id. at p. 12). If the provider does not meet the 
required amount of purchases, it must pay Becton's highest price for the products (Id.). Becton's net dealer contracts also 
usually contain sole or dual source provisions (Id. at p. 11). Sole source provisions require providers to purchase products only 
from Becton while dual source provisions permit providers to purchase from only one other approved non-Becton manufacturer 
(Id.). If the provider violates the source provision, it must pay higher prices (Id.). "
242,5," Notably, the contracts at issue here do not qualify for the ""cost-plus"" exception to the direct purchaser rule because the 
distributor agreements do not contemplate a strict purchasing requirement or pre-date the overcharge. Illinois Brick, 431 U.S. at 
735-36. "
247,1," The CNS states that Defendant ""will never institute any action or lawsuit at law or in equity against Covenantee"" for all of 
Defendant's patents, including the '261 Patent. Mot., Ex. 1. To support its arguments, Defendant relies primarily on Already, LLC 
v. Nike. Defendant asserts that, like the counterclaims in Already, Plaintiff's Counts 1-3 should be rendered moot as ""the 
allegedly wrongful behavior could [not] reasonably be expected to recur."" Mot. at 14 (citing Already, 568 U.S. at 92 ). Defendant 
further argues that ""[a] cursory review of [Defendant's] Covenant Not To Sue reveals that its scope is similar to the one in 
Already, LLC¸ which . . . the Supreme Court deemed sufficient to render that case moot."" Id. at 16. "
248,2," While Plaintiff agrees that Already governs, it argues that ""[Defendant] has not met its formidable burden as its proffered CNS 
is not sufficiently broad to trigger the mootness and voluntary cessation doctrines cited in Already."" Opp. at 3. Plaintiff's 
arguments focus on distinguishing the CNS from the covenant not to sue in Already. Id. at 3-4. Plaintiff asserts that Defendant's 
reliance on Already is inappropriate as ""the CNS in [Already] was uncontested."" Id. at 3. Next, Plaintiff argues that, unlike the 
CNS, the covenant not to sue in Already was ""unconditional and irrevocable,"" and ""extended to customers and distributors."" Id. 
at 4. Plaintiff further argues that, under the language of the CNS, ""[Defendant] is now able to sue [Plaintiff's] customers; 
employees; online distributors; and platforms (e.g., Shopify). Further, [Defendant] can revoke the CNS at any point."" Id. 
(parenthetical numbering omitted). Defendant disagrees with Plaintiff's characterization of the CNS. Responding to Plaintiff's concerns, Defendant states that ""[t]he 
CNS covers [Plaintiff] as Covenantee and; therefore, by extension, also covers [Plaintiff's] employees,"" and ""the CNS covers any 
possible cause of action arising out of [Defendant's] patents."" Reply at 8. Defendant further asserts that, while the CNS does not 
mention Plaintiff's customers, distributors, or platforms, ""the claimed steps of the '216[sic] Patent—which recite a method for an 
automated notification system—are not performed by entities such as [Plaintiff's] customers or distributors; and therefore, they 
cannot be sued for infringement of the '261 Patent."" Id. The Court will address these points after preliminarily discussing Already 
and other relevant case law. "
249,3," Plaintiff asserts that the CNS is distinct from the covenant not to sue in Already and is not sufficient because it (1) omits the 
phrase ""unconditional and irrevocable,"" (2) does not extend to employees, customers, online distributors, and platforms, and (3) 
does not include ""any possible cause of action."" Opp. at 4. The Court will address these arguments in turn. First, while omitting the phrase ""unconditional and irrevocable,"" the CNS states that ""Covenantors will never institute any action 
or lawsuit."" Mot., Exh. 1. Plaintiff fails to explain why the term ""never"" is not sufficient as compared to the phrase ""unconditional 
and irrevocable."" Additionally, Defendant has stated its willingness to include the phrase ""unconditional and irrevocable"" to the 
CNS if ""[Plaintiff's] unwillingness to accept [Defendant's] CNS hinges on the inclusion of the phrase . . . . "" Reply at 7, n1. The 
Court sees no need to include this phrase in view of the terminology already present in the CNS. Second, although the covenant not to sue in Already specifically carved out Nike's customers, employees and distributors, the 
covenant not to sue in Phoenix did not but was still found to be ""sufficiently broad to constitute a relinquishment of the rights."" 
Phoenix, 014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 194667, 2014 WL 12569344 at *2. There is no set requirement that a covenant not to sue list out 
all parties associated with the covenantee to be sufficiently broad. Further, as discussed by Defendant, Plaintiff's employees 
appear covered under Plaintiff as the ""covenantee"" and it is unclear how Plaintiff's customers, distributors, or platforms would 
even infringe the '261 Patent. Reply at 8. Third, the CNS specifically states that ""Covenantors will never institute any actions or lawsuit at law or in equity against 
Covenantee nor institute, prosecute, make allegations of, or in any way aid in the institution or prosecution of any claims, 
demands, actions, or causes of actions . . . relating in any way to any claims of patent infringement of any of the patents listed . . "
250,," . ."" Mot., Exh. 1. This language encompasses ""any possible cause of action"" as it relates to infringement of Defendant's patents 
and is found to be sufficiently broad. "
251,4," The Court assumes that Plaintiff brings this claim under the ""unfair prong"" based on the allegations in the Complaint. See, e.g., 
Compl. ¶ 93 (""True Grit seeks all compensatory and statutory damages allowed under Section 17200's Unfair Business 
Practices prong."") (emphasis added)."
251,5," Plaintiff asserts that ""[t]his Court has jurisdiction over [Plaintiff's] claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1338 and 1367, and 35 U.S.C. 
§ 271. Should [Defendant] attempt to avoid adjudicating the merits of [Plaintiff's] declaratory judgment claims by filing a covenant 
not to sue, this Court maintains jurisdiction over [Plaintiff's] state law claims based on diversity jurisdiction."" Compl. ¶ 6. Plaintiff 
further states that ""[t]his Court [ ] has diversity jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1332 because the Parties 
reside in different states and there is more than $75,000 dollar at-issue."" Id. ¶ 5. Defendant does not dispute that the parties 
reside in different states, but argues that ""the Complaint does not contain any allegations which plausibly show that [Plaintiff] 
meets the amount in controversy."" Mot. at 21. Plaintiff failed to provide information about the amount in controversy in its 
Complaint, but listed its estimated loss in revenue in its opposition. Opp. at 8. Plaintiff lists the following estimated costs: • Product release delays $5,000-$10,000 • Cancelled product releases: $20,000-$30,000 "
252,," • Cancellation of physical merchandise $5,000-$8,000 Opp. at 8. Plaintiff goes on to state that ""[t]he stake in the litigation costs as plead likely exceed twenty (20) times the requisite $75,000."" 
Opp. at 9. Although Plaintiff's total estimated loss in revenue only amounts to a maximum of $48,000, attorney's fees and other 
costs associated with the litigation as pleaded in the Complaint are sufficient to meet the amount in controversy requirement. 
This is not a case where ""upon the face of the complaint, it is obvious that the suit cannot involve the necessary amount."" St. 
Paul Mercury Indem. Co. v. Red Cab Co., 303 U.S. 283, 292-93, 58 S. Ct. 586, 82 L. Ed. 845 (1938)."
252,6," Plaintiff's additional allegations of harm under its UCL claim are merely conclusory allegations about Defendant's ""unethical, 
oppressive, unscrupulous"" practice. Compl. ¶ 87. "
256,1," The Extraction Defendants concede that Plaintiffs have identified an agreement between two economically distinct entities. 
(Extraction Motion at 11.) "
257,2," Bison contends that Plaintiffs' inability to sufficiently allege an agreement is particularly problematic because Plaintiffs have 
already engaged in extensive discovery. In response, Plaintiffs allege additional facts obtained during discovery that bolster the 
claims asserted in the Third Amended Complaint. Of course, it would be improper for the Court to consider any facts not 
contained in the Third Amended Complaint in resolving the motions to dismiss. See Fluid Tech., Inc. v. CVJ Axles, Inc., 964 P.2d 
614, 616 (Colo. App. 1998). "
259,3," Although the Indication of Interest is not specifically mentioned in the Complaint, all parties rely on it in making their arguments 
to the Court. Even if the Court disregarded the Indication of Interest, its analysis and the outcome of the Motions to Dismiss 
would remain the same. "
260,4," The Extraction Defendants first argue that Plaintiffs fail to allege an antitrust claim under the rule of reason because they fail to 
allege harm to competition. The Extraction Defendants separately argue that Plaintiffs fail to allege any antitrust claim because 
they fail allege an antitrust injury. The Court finds these arguments largely duplicative, so addresses them together. The Court 
notes that Bison did not argue that Plaintiffs failed to allege antitrust injury."
260,5," Plaintiffs can sometimes establish the anticompetitive effect under the ""quick look"" doctrine, where courts ""simply assume the 
existence of anticompetitive effect where the conduct at issue amounts to a naked and effective restraint on price or output that 
carries obvious anticompetitive consequences."" Gunnison Energy Corp., 846 F.3d at 1311(internal quotations omitted). In that 
case, the burden shifts to the defendant to demonstrate a countervailing procompetitive effect. Id. "
274,1," Defendant Eva Kwong was dismissed from this lawsuit without prejudice through a Rule 41(a)(1)(A)(i) dismissal on November 
1, 2018. See Doc. No. 22. "
275,2," ""Foliar feeding"" is the application of nutrients to crops by spraying liquid fertilizer directly on to the leaves."
275,3," ""Fertigation"" refers to a fertilization process whereby fertilizers are added to the water being used to irrigate crops, and reflects 
a combination of irrigation and fertilization. "
278,4," Cal. Civ. Code § 1542 reads: ""A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist 
in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her 
settlement with the debtor."" "
280,5," There is no argument by Deerpoint that Mahoney misappropriated different trade secrets after the Settlement was signed. 
Therefore, the Court will view the Complaint as alleging that the trade secrets that Mahoney misappropriated pre-Settlement are 
the same trade secrets that were allegedly misappropriated post-Settlement."
280,6," Deerpoint also cites Tire Hanger Corp. v. Shinn Fu Co. of Am., 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 178833 (C.D. Cal. June 7, 2017) and 
Management Action Programs, Inc. v. Global Leadership & Mgmt. Resources, Inc., 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 45627 (C.D. Cal. May 
18, 2005) for the proposition that parties to a release may sue for post-release conduct that is not covered by the release. The 
Court does not disagree with this proposition. However, that general principal is not at issue. What is at issue is whether the 
Settlement bars a CUTSA claim based on post-Settlement conduct and pre-Settlement misappropriated trade secrets. Neither 
Tire Hanger nor Management Action involved CUTSA claims, let alone the type of post-Settlement CUTSA claim alleged by 
Deerpoint. See Tire Hanger, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 178833 at *1, *12 (listing the claims in the case, without identifying a CUTSA 
claim); Management Action Programs, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 45627 at *12 (same). "
282,7," To be clear, the Court is not holding that a successful CUTSA plaintiff could not obtain injunctive relief that required the 
misappropriator to return misappropriated trade secrets and destroy copies. In fact, such relief would seem to be entirely 
reasonable, considering the nature of a trade secret. The Court is merely noting that this is something that is not expressly part 
of CUTSA."
282,8," The Court notes that Paragraph 4 of the EIS also obligates Mahoney to return Deerpoint's property upon his leaving the 
company."
282,9," HN10[
] Because Mahoney's misappropriation of trade secrets is clearly a material breach of the EIS, Deerpoint technically 
had the option to terminate the contract. See Multani v. Knight, 23 Cal. App. 5th 837, 852, 233 Cal. Rptr. 3d 537 (2018) (""[W]hen 
one party to a contract breaches a material term of the contract, the other party has the option to terminate the contract for 
cause.""). Reaffirmance of the relevant portions of the EIS indicates that the various obligations of the EIS remain in effect, 
irrespective of any contrary argument that might have otherwise been possible from the Settlement."
282,10," Again, the Court emphasizes that Deerpoint has not identified any trade secrets that were misappropriated by Mahoney post-
Settlement. Therefore, the only trade secrets that are at issue are trade secrets that were misappropriated by Mahoney pre-
Settlement. "
283,11," The parties' arguments with respect to Agrigenix and the Settlement relate to the CUTSA and DTSA claims. Therefore, the 
Court's analysis is limited to Deerpoint's trade secret claims against Agrigenix. "
285,12," Paragraph 14.6 in relevant part states that Mahoney recognizes and acknowledges that Deerpoint ""shall be entitled to an 
injunction from any court of competent jurisdiction enjoining and restraining any breach or violation of any or all of the covenants 
set forth in Paragraphs 14.1 to 14.5 [which includes trade secret confidentiality] by [Mahoney] or any company with which he is 
affiliated or in which he holds an ownership interest . . . . Nothing contained in this Paragraph 14.6 shall be construed to prevent 
[Deerpoint] from seeking and receiving from [Mahoney], or from any company with which he is affiliated or in which he holds an 
ownership interest, damages sustained by [Deerpoint] . . . ."" Id. at ¶ 14.6. This paragraph clearly addresses companies that 
Mahoney may work for or have some connection or ownership interest in, which would include Agrigenix. However, Paragraph 
14.6 is an acknowledgement by Mahoney that Deerpoint can seek relief against such a company, it creates no actual obligations 
on, or penalties against, such a company, nor does it guarantee injunctive relief will issue against such a company. Paragraph 
14.6 is relevant to the parties' intentions, but it does not definitively show that Agrigenix is or is not an intended third-party 
beneficiary."
285,13," The Court could order the parties to present evidence, which would convert the Rule 12(b)(6) motion into a motion for 
summary judgment. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(d). However, no party has requested conversion of the Rule 12(b)(6) motion, and it is 
highly likely that necessary discovery has not yet occurred. Cf. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(d) (addressing denials of summary judgment "
286,," when inadequate discovery has occurred). Therefore, the Court will not order the parties to submit evidence and convert this 
motion to a Rule 56 motion for summary judgment. "
287,14," Superseded by statute on other grounds as explained in Rosen v. State Farm Gen. Life Ins. Co., 30 Cal.4th 1070, 1079-80, 
135 Cal. Rptr. 2d 361, 70 P.3d 351 (2003). "
288,15," In a separate portion of Deerpoint's opposition, it references Paragraphs 81, which alleges disparaging comments by 
Defendants against Deerpoint to third-parties who decided to hire Agrigenix. However, the IIPEA claim expressly identifies the 
wrongful acts at issue in Paragraphs 147 and 148. ""Disparagement"" is conspicuously absent from Paragraphs 147 and 148. It is 
true that Paragraph 144 incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 to 143. However, incorporating literally all 143 preceding 
paragraphs, without specific reference to either disparagement or Paragraph 81, does not give Defendants (or the Court) fair 
notice of the factual bases of the IIPEA claim. See Weiland v. Palm Beach Cnty. Sheriff's Office, 792 F.3d 1313, 1321-23 (11th 
Cir. 2015) (describing four different types of improper pleadings that fail to give a defendant fair notice, including ""the mortal sin 
of re-alleging all preceding counts""); JN Grp. Holdings, Inc. v. Ryan, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9215, *7 (D. Haw. Jan. 19, 2018); 
Salcido v. Vericrest Fin. & Summit Mgmt. Co., LLC, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 158460, *22 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 5, 2013). The Court will 
not read the IIPEA claim as being based to any degree on ""disparagement."" See Weiland, 792 F.3d at 1321-23. "
290,16," Disapproved on other grounds by Kwikset Corp. v. Superior Ct., 51 Cal.4th 310, 337, 120 Cal. Rptr. 3d 741, 246 P.3d 877 
(2011)."
290,17," As discussed in Footnote 15, supra, the IIPEA allegations do not provide fair notice that the claim is based on 
""disparagement."" Therefore, the Court does not consider arguments based on ""disparagement."" See Weiland, 792 F.3d at 1321-
23. Further, the Complaint does not indicate that a UCL claim also forms a basis for the IIPEA claim. "
291,18," Deerpoint's opposition defends its UCL claim by arguing it is based on IIPEA and disparagement. The allegations under the 
UCL do not reference disparagement. The UCL claim suffers from the improper shotgun tactic of incorporating by reference 
every single paragraph that preceded it. Therefore, just as with the IIPEA claim, the Court will not consider any arguments in 
support of the UCL claim that are based on disparagement. See Weiland, 792 F.3d at 1321-23; Footnotes 15 & 17, supra. "
292,19," There is no contractual relationship between Deerpoint and Agrigenix. Therefore, a breach of contract based UCL claim is only 
possible against Mahoney."
292,20," HN34[
] The terms ""unlawful,"" ""unfair,"" and ""fraudulent"" are terms of art under the UCL. ""A business practice is 'fraudulent' 
under the UCL if members of the public are likely to be deceived."" Davis v. HSBC Bank, 691 F.3d 1152, 1169 (9th Cir. 2012) 
(citing Puentes, 160 Cal.App.4th at 645). The UCL's ""unlawful"" prong ""borrows violations of other laws . . . and makes those 
unlawful practices actionable under the UCL,"" and that ""virtually any law or regulation — federal or state, statutory or common 
law — can serve as a predicate . . . ."" Candelore v. Tinder, Inc., 19 Cal.App.5th 1138, 1155, 228 Cal. Rptr. 3d 336 (2018). 
California law with respect to ""unfair"" conduct is currently ""in flux."" Hodsdon v. Mars, Inc., 891 F.3d 857, 866 (9th Cir. 2018). 
Conduct is ""unfair"" either when it ""threatens an incipient violation of an antitrust law, or violates the policy or spirit of one of 
those laws because its effects are comparable to or the same as a violation of the law, or otherwise significantly threatens or 
harms competition,"" or when it ""'offends an established public policy or when the practice is immoral, unethical, oppressive, 
unscrupulous or substantially injurious to consumers."" Id."
292,21," HN36[
] UCL claims that are based on ""fraudulent"" conduct must meet Rule 9(b)'s heightened pleading standard, meaning that the ""who, what, when, where, and how"" of the fraudulent conduct, as well as what conduct/statement is misleading and why 
it is false, must be expressly alleged. Davidson v. Kimberly-Clark Corp., 889 F.3d 956, 964 (9th Cir. 2018). Although the 
allegations under the UCL indicate that Defendants engaged in fraudulent conduct, the allegations do not meet Rule 9(b)'s 
pleading standards. Indeed, the allegations under the UCL do not attempt to identify any ""fraudulent"" conduct. Although other 
paragraphs in the Complaint may indicate ""fraudulent"" conduct, the shotgun incorporation by reference of literally every prior 
allegation that preceded the UCL claim is improper and does not meet Rule 8 standards, let alone Rule 9 standards. See 
Weiland, 792 F.3d at 1321-23."
292,22," Again, other allegations in the Complaint may indicate ""unfair"" conduct. However, Deerpoint's shotgun incorporation by 
reference of every prior allegation that preceded the UCL claim is improper and does not meet Rule 8 standards. See Weiland, 
792 F.3d at 1321-23; Footnotes 15, 17, & 18, supra. "
293,23," Deerpoint's opposition cites Paragraphs 72, 75, and 77 in support of its assertion that Mahoney did not stop Agrigenix from 
publishing certain aspects of Deerpoint's trade secrets. See Doc. No. 14 at p.20. As detailed below, neither the substance of 
Paragraphs 72, 75, and 77 nor an express reference to those paragraphs are found under the fifth and seventh causes of action. 
Like all of the other causes of action, the fifth and seventh causes of action incorporate by reference literally every prior 
allegation that preceded them. See Complaint ¶¶ 123, 139. Again, this form ofHN38[
]  shotgun pleading is improper and does 
not provide sufficient notice that Deerpoint is relying on conduct by Mahoney as an Agrigenix executive to prevent publication of 
trade secrets by Agrigenix. See Weiland, 792 F.3d at 1321-23. Therefore, the Court's analysis will not consider or discuss any 
argument based on the incorporation of Paragraphs 72, 75, or 77 of the Complaint. See id.; Footnotes 14 and 16, supra. "
325,1," There are two versions of the motions, responses, and declarations and exhibits filed in support of thereof: a redacted public 
version; and an unredacted version filed under seal with the Court's permission because it contains confidential information. If 
there are two docket numbers listed for a particular flling, the docket number beginning with ""S-"" denotes the version filed under 
seal. "
329,2," In Bonner v. City of Prichard, Ala., 661 F.2d 1206, 1207 (Ilth Cir. 1981), the Eleventh Circuit adopted as binding precedent 
decisions of the former Fifth Circuit rendered prior to October 1, 1981. "
333,3," ""Although an unpublished opinion is not binding ..., it is persuasive authority."" United States v. Futrell, 209 F.3d 1286, 1289

351,4," In his Supplemental Declaration, dated September 8, 2017, Dr. Williams revised his overcharge estimates for Defendants 
JJVC, Alcon and B&L, taking into consideration additional data that had become available through discovery since his March 3, 
2017 initial Report. In these revised estimates, Dr. Williams calculated the percentage change in ""Price Effects of the UPP"" using 
data from various sales channels. for both the Horizontal Agreement Model and the Vertical Agreement Model. (See Doc. S-651 
at 74-85, 124-41 (Williams Supp. Decl. ¶¶ 135-57, Appendix Tables 2-19). However, because he was continuing to review data 
and ""performing additional economic analysis, [he had] not performed new damages calculations for this report."" Id. at 85 
(Williams Supp. Decl. ¶ 157)). On December 4, 2017, Dr. Williams reported that ""[d]ollar values of estimated damages are 
updated based on new data and information, and they confirm the core conclusion in both of my reports that UPPs caused price 
increases for all or nearly all class members."" (Doc. S-723 at 50 (Williams 2d Supp. Decl. ¶ 40)). "
397,5," On September 26, 2018, the Court ordered the parties to submit a joint notice indicating their respective positions on whether 
the Court may consider the Plaintiffs' factual allegations regarding their motion as part of the Court's determination of Plaintiffs' 
motion for class certification. (Doc. 894). The parties' joint submission indicates that the parties disagree on whether Plaintiffs' 
factual allegations should be so considered. (Doc. 902). As the remainder of this section indicates, the Court has decided to take 
Plaintiffs' motion under advisement. "
398,6," Plaintiffs are not currently seeking sanctions against Defendants B&L and ABB. B&L denies that any of its employees 
monitored, posted, or otherwise participated in the UPP Violations group. (Doc. 879). ABB avers that one of its document 
custodians was a member of the group, but that his membership was unrelated to his employment. (Doc. 882). Plaintiffs' request 
the Court to order B&L and ABB to conduct further investigations into whether its employees were members of the group. "
400,7," Bleeker's interpretation of ""practical ability"" as encompassing a legal right to information in the possession of a non-party has 
been reinforced by district courts within this Circuit. See.e.g"" Siegmund v. Bian, No. 12-62539-CIV, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
46610, 2016 WL 1359595, at *3 (S.D. Fla. Apr. 6, 2016) (""[E]ven under the most expansive interpretation of 'control', the 
'practical ability' to demand production must be accompanied by a similar ability to enforce compliance with that demand."" 
(quoting Klesch & Co. v. Liberty Media Corp., 217 F.R.D. 517, 520 (D. Colo. 2003))); Mamani v. Sanchez De Lozada Sanchez 
Bustamante, No. 07-22459-CIV, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 127818, 2017 WL 3456327, at *3 (S.D. Fla. Aug. 11, 2017) (""[The 
plaintiff] can be compelled to produce only documents that he has the 'legal right' to obtain 'upon demand' with the 'ability to

400,8," Plaintiffs cite a litany of cases for the proposition that ""when a party has access to relevant evidence on Facebook, that 
evidence falls within that party's 'possession, custody, or control' and must be preserved and/or produced."" (Doc. 854 at 19). 
Plaintiffs' cases, however, all involve the social media posts of persons who were a party to the litigation. See Painter v. Atwood, 
No. 2:12-CV-01215-JCM, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 35060, ,2014 WL 1089694, at *4 (D. Nev. Mar. 18, 2014) (adverse inference 
granted in part where the plaintiff deleted Facebook posts and pictures created and maintained by the plaintiff); Howell v. 
Buckeye Ranch, Inc., No. 2:11-CV-1014, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 141368, 2012 WL 5265170, at *2 (S.D. Ohio Oct. 1, 2012) 
(motion to compel production of relevant information contained within the plaintiff's private social media accounts granted); 
Higgins v. Koch Dev. Corp., No. 3:11-CV-81-RLY-WGH, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 94139, 2013 WL 3366278, at *3 (S.D. Ind. July 
5,2013) (compelling plaintiffs to produce their own Facebook posts); Federico v. Lincoln Military Hous., LLC, 2014 U.S. Dist. 
LEX1S 178943, *18 (E.D. Va. Dec. 31, 2014) (motion for sanctions granted in part for the plaintiffs' failure to turn over their own 
social media posts in timely manner). "
401,9," Plaintiffs' First Amended Consolidated Complaint, filed in November of 2015, refers to the ""ODs on Facebook"" group twice. 
(See Doc. 133). "
411,1," The USP is a scientific nonprofit organization that sets standards for identity, strength, quality, and purity of medicines, food 
ingredients, and dietary supplements that are manufactured, distributed, and consumed worldwide. (Id. at 14.) USP standards 
are enforceable as binding by the United States Food and Drug Administration (""FDA""). 21 U.S.C. § 351(b). "
412,2," The Court takes judicial notice of the District of Massachusetts proceedings, as those proceedings are public record and 
integral to the Amended Complaint. See Campbell v. Nationstar Mortg., 611 F. App'x 288, 291 (6th Cir. 2011) (HN1[
] ""In 
addition to the allegations in the complaint, [the Court] may also consider other materials that are integral to the complaint, are 
public records, or are otherwise appropriate for the taking of judicial notice.""). "
414,3," As a preliminary matter, Plaintiffs argue that Defendants' Rule 12(b)(1) motion confuses jurisdictional and merits-based issues. 
(Doc. No. 208 at 9-10.) However, the Court is convinced that Defendants' Rule 12(b)(1) motion properly raises issues regarding 
Article III standing. Defendants do not argue that Plaintiffs have failed to satisfy certain statutory elements of federal antitrust 
law, rather, they raise a facial challenge to Plaintiffs' Article III standing to pursue the Sherman Act claims for injunctive and 
declaratory relief. (See Doc. No. 196.)"
414,4," The Court retains subject matter jurisdiction over Plaintiffs' state law claims pursuant to HN6[
] the Class Action Fairness Act,"
414,28," U.S.C. §§ 1711, et seq., which vests original jurisdiction in the district courts of the United States for any multi-state class 
action where the aggregate amount in controversy exceeds $5 million and where the citizenship of any member of the class of 
plaintiffs is different from that of any defendant. Accordingly, the Court proceeds to consider whether it has personal jurisdiction 
over the Defendants' with regard to Plaintiffs' remaining state law claims. "
415,5," HN9[
] Plaintiffs have the burden of showing personal jurisdiction but ""that burden is 'relatively slight' where, as here, the . . . 
court rules without conducting an evidentiary hearing."" MAG IAS Holdings, Inc. v. Schmückle, 854 F.3d 894, 899 (6th Cir. 2017) 
(citing Air Prods & Controls Inc. v. Safetech Int'l Inc., 503 F.3d 544, 549 (6th Cir. 2007) (quotation omitted)). ""To defeat dismissal 
in this context, [Plaintiffs] need make only a prima facie showing that personal jurisdiction exists."" Id. Nevertheless, ""[i]n 
response to a motion to dismiss, the plaintiff may not stand on his pleadings, but must show the specific facts demonstrating that 
the court has jurisdiction."" Miller v. AXA Winterthur Ins. Co., 694 F.3d 675, 678 (6th Cir. 2012) (citing Theunissen v. Matthews, 
935 F.2d 1454, 1458 (6th Cir. 1991))."
415,6," HN10[
] ""Tennessee's long-arm statute has been interpreted to be 'coterminous with the limits on personal jurisdiction imposed' by the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution,"" and, thus, ""'the jurisdictional limits of Tennessee law 
and of federal constitutional law of due process are identical.'"" Intera Corp. v. Henderson, 428 F.3d 605, 616 (6th Cir. 2005) 
(citation omitted). Because of that, ""the court 'need only determine whether the assertion of personal jurisdiction violates 
constitutional due process.'"" Id. (citation omitted). "
416,7," Although Defendants argue that Keeton's analysis was refuted by Bristol-Myers, the latter analysis was limited to considering 
the former decision in the context of mass torts. See Bristol-Myers, 137 S.Ct. at 1782. Further, as explained below, the Court 
concludes that Bristol-Myers is not applicable to class actions. "
417,8," Accordingly, the parties' arguments regarding the fraudulent concealment doctrine and the discovery rule are not discussed. "
419,9," Defendants argue, and Plaintiffs conceded, that Alabama's antitrust law does not provide a cause of action in the instant case. 
(Doc. Nos. 198 at 24, 210 at 22 n. 19.) Therefore, the Court will dismiss that claim with prejudice. "
423,1," The Court will refer to the Patent Action and Trade Secret Action, collectively, as the ""Illinois Actions."""
423,2," In the previous iteration of their pleading, Plaintiffs alleged that the Illinois Actions were pieces of ""sham litigation"" and, 
therefore, examples of Motorola's anticompetitive conduct. (See generally Compl., ECF No. 1). Motorola removed those 
allegations when filing its Amended Complaint. (See generally Am Compl., ECF No. 45). "
424,3," In Transamerica, the Court of Appeals found that an insurer should be considered an ""opposing party"" for Rule 13 purposes, as 
it found that the insurer was the successor in interest and assignee of the rights of the named parties in the original litigation, and 
that the insurer ""was actually the party controlling the litigation in both actions."" Id. at 392. "
427,4," It also bears noting that only one of the four Plaintiff entities appears to have New Jersey ties. The other three Plaintiff entities 
would, therefore, be litigating in a foreign jurisdiction regardless of whether the case proceeds in this District or in the Northern 
District of Illinois. "
429,5," Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that the New Jersey Transit Authority ""awarded Alcatel-Lucent a contract for bus radios, using 
PowerTrunk as a subcontractor for the radios."" (Id. ¶ 130). "
432,6," Motorola also argues that the cases are related because Plaintiffs cite the Illinois Actions as two examples of sham litigation by 
Motorola in their Complaint, and cite two of the seven patents at issue in the Patent Action as examples of Motorola's 
anticompetitive conduct. (Id.). These arguments, which address the previous iteration of Plaintiffs' pleading, are no longer 
applicable, as Plaintiffs abandoned those allegations when filing their Amended Complaint. The Court is not suggesting any error 
on Motorola's part. At the time Motorola filed its briefing, the original Complaint remained Plaintiffs' operative pleading. Plaintiffs 
did not file their Amended Complaint until several months after the parties finished briefing Motorola's motion."
432,7," Again, the Court acknowledges that, at the time Motorola made this argument, Plaintiffs had alleged that the Illinois Actions 
were themselves examples of Motorola's allegedly anticompetitive conduct. Plaintiffs, however, removed those allegations when 
filing their Amended Complaint. (Compare Compl., ECF No. 1, with Am. Compl. ECF No. 45). "
439,1," Over the lifespan of this case, WestRock has undergone corporate changes and thus has been known by various names, 
including RockTenn CP, LLC and Smurfit-Stone Container Corporation. We refer to the business by its present name. "
457,1," Plaintiff states that it has ""removed"" from the Second Amended Complaint its previous claims for: (a) unfair competition, (b) 
abuse of process, (c) negligence, and (d) its claim for punitive damages against the City of Sea Isle City. (Opposition Brief, Dkt 
77, p. 1) Although the Court previously directed that ""[i]f Plaintiff decides that it no longer wishes to pursue . . . any . . . claims 
presently asserted in the Amended Complaint, it shall file the appropriate Notice of Voluntary Dismissal or Stipulation of 
Dismissal,"" 8600 Landis, LLC, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 50003, 2018 WL 1509088 at *14 n.23, no notice or stipulation has been 
filed on the Court's docket. In light of the Court's directive, combined with Plaintiff's statement in its brief, the Court construes 
Plaintiff's inaction as a concession that the pleading deficiencies identified with respect to these claims cannot be cured, and 
these claims will be dismissed with prejudice. See Duke University v. Apotex, Inc., 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 64973, 2015 WL 
2383408 at *2 (M.D.N.C. 2015) (""the Court has the discretion to impose conditions on a grant of leave to amend (such as 
deeming eliminated claims dismissed with prejudice)[.]"")."
457,2," In light of the disposition of the motions filed by the Sea Isle Defendants and Defendant Baldini, the Court need not reach the 
issues raised by the Restaurant Defendants' Motion to Dismiss which do not relate to the merits of the federal claims."
457,3," For completeness, the state law claims are: violation of the New Jersey Civil Rights Act, tortious interference with prospective 
economic advantage, common law conspiracy, and violations of the New Jersey Antitrust Act. However, as stated above, the 
Court does not rule on these claims. "
458,4, The parties do not dispute that Plaintiff has a property interest that is protected by the Due Process Clause.
458,5," See also United Artists, 316 F.3d at 402 (""every appeal by a disappointed developer from an adverse ruling of the local 
planning board involves some claim of abuse of legal authority, but it is not enough simply to give these state law claims 
constitutional labels such as 'due process' or 'equal protection' in order to raise a substantial federal question under section 
1983. Land-use decisions are matters of local concern, and such disputes should not be transformed into substantive due 
process claims based only on allegations that government officials acted with 'improper' motives.""); Whittaker, 437 F. App'x at 
109 (""the Property Owners simply allege that the defendants did not follow state law in taking their property. While this certainly 
is not conduct without a remedy, the remedy is not provided by the Federal Constitution's substantive due process clause. For 
this reason, we will affirm the District Court's dismissal of the substantive due process claim.""); Blain v. Twp. of Radnor, 167 F. 
App'x 330, 333 (3d Cir. 2006) (""Th[e] [shocks the conscience] standard's stringency reflects maintenance of the proper 
proportions of constitutional, as opposed to ordinary tort, violations.""); Maple Properties, Inc. v. Twp. of Upper Providence, 151 
F. App'x 174, 180 (3d Cir. 2005) (""we have previously recognized that the politics and animosities that often animate local 
decision-making are not matters of constitutional concern.""); see generally, City of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 863-64, 
118 S. Ct. 1708, 140 L. Ed. 2d 1043 (1998) (rejecting a constitutional standard that ""would make the Fourteenth Amendment a 
font of tort law to be superimposed upon whatever systems may already be administered by the States."")."
458,6," This principle is particularly important in the substantive due process analysis where ""[w]hat is [conscience] shocking depends 
on the factual context."" Selig, 653 F. App'x at 157 (citing United Artists). Therefore, Plaintiff's explanation in its opposition brief 
that the Second Amended Complaint ""includes allegations of self-dealing, where public officials took advantage of their positions 
to benefit themselves and stifle competition to their personal businesses"" (Opposition Brief, Dkt 77, p. 24), does little to advance 
the legal analysis."
458,7," Allegedly, in Sea Isle City, there are only eight liquor licenses of the class that Plaintiff and Defendant Desiderio hold. (S.A.C. ¶ 
74) "
459,8," It is not clear whether this incident occurred before or after Defendant Zoning Officer Cornelius Byrne allegedly ""refused to 
issue the necessary permits for the first floor restaurant space"" of Plaintiff's project. (S.A.C. ¶ 47) If it occurred before, the 
Second Amended Complaint is not clear as to what ""problem"" there might have been at that time."
459,9," The Second Amended Complaint is vague as to what Defendant Desiderio allegedly ""ordered"" Defendant Byrne to do. Notably, 
the Second Amended Complaint clearly pleads that Defendant Byrne issued the Stop Work Order after asking for, and receiving, 
Defendant Baldini's legal opinion on the matter. (S.A.C. ¶¶ 52-53) The Second Amended Complaint specifically alleges that ""[a]s 
a result of Paul J. Baldini's improper legal opinion and in reliance on Baldini's conclusions, on September 23, 2015, Mr. Byrne 
improperly issued, by correspondence, a Stop Work Order to Plaintiff, which significantly delayed Plaintiff from finishing 
construction on the first floor restaurant space and caused substantial monetary damages."" (S.A.C. ¶ 57; emphasis added); (see 
also S.A.C. ¶ 5, alleging that Defendants Byrne and Baldini ""improperly revoked Plaintiff's approvals necessary to complete [its] 
project.""). The Second Amended Complaint does not allege that Defendant Desiderio ordered Byrne to issue the Stop Work 
Order, nor does it allege that Defendant Desiderio had any involvement with the drafting of Defendant Baldini's legal opinion."
459,10," Maple Properties, 151 F. App'x at 180, also cites Conroe as an example of ""patently egregious behavior recognized . . . to 
constitute a substantive due process claim."" "
460,11," Plaintiff alleges an underlying violation of the Sherman Act, but Plaintiff's rights in that regard arise from federal statute, not the 
United States Constitution. Eichenlaub and subsequent cases are clear that the relevant inquiry is whether ""local officials are 
accused of seeking to hamper development in order to interfere with otherwise constitutionally protected activity."" 385 F.3d at 
286 (emphasis added); Button v. Snelson, 679 F. App'x 150, 154 (3d Cir. 2017) (citing Eichenlaub); Selig, 653 F. App'x at 157 
(quoting Eichenlaub); Perano v. Twp. of Tilden, 423 F. App'x 234, 238 (3d Cir. 2011) (observing that the local officals' acts in 
Eichenlaub ""were not enough to shock the conscience when those actions were not coupled with interference with a 
constitutionally protected activity or ethnic bias.""); Dotzel v. Ashbridge, 306 F. App'x 798, 801 (3d Cir. 2009) (""There is no 
evidence that the supervisors' conduct involved self-dealing or interfered with constitutionally protected activity.""). In any event, 
as discussed infra, Plaintiff fails to state a claim for violation of the Sherman Act."
460,12," Though not argued in its opposition briefs, Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint appears to suggest that Defendant Paul 
Baldini somehow acted ultra vires. In particular, the Second Amended Complaint alleges that ""Sea Isle City specifically 
conceded in Court to Judge Mendez that Baldini, as Solicitor, had no legal right to set aside the Plaintiff's Planning Board 
approvals."" (S.A.C. ¶ 56) First, the transcript of the hearing before Judge Mendez, attached as Exhibit S to the Second Amended 
Complaint, is somewhat equivocal, and it may not be fair to characterize what was said as a ""specific[] conce[ssion]."" (Id.) In any 
event, even if, as a legal matter, the City Solicitor lacks authority to ""set aside"" a zoning board approval or issue a Stop Work 
Order, this fact would not plausibly support a conclusion that Defendant Baldini acted egregiously as a matter of federal 
constitutional law because the Second Amended Complaint specifically pleads that Defendant Zoning Officer Byrne, rather than 
Defendant Baldini, issued the Stop Work Order. (S.A.C. ¶¶ 6, 57) "
461,13," See also, Glob. Tower Assets, LLC v. Town of Rome, 810 F.3d 77, 91 (1st Cir. 2016) (""the Applicants' vague allegations of 
conflicts of interest and financially motivated conspiracy do not-- at least without far more-- show that the Planning Board acted 
in the kind of conscience-shocking fashion that we require for substantive due process challenges to make it past the gate."")."
461,14," See also, Highway Materials, Inc. v. Whitemarsh Twp., 386 F. App'x 251, 259 (3d Cir. 2010) (quoting Eichenlaub). "
462,15," In a letter filed with the Court long after briefing on the instant motions was completed (see Dkt 88), Plaintiff asserts additional 
facts which it says further support its equal protection claim. As an initial matter, as discussed during a telephone conference 
with the parties (Dkt 93), the Court does not construe Plaintiff's informal letter to be a formal motion to amend its complaint for a 
third time. Moreover, none of the facts alleged in the letter could potentially change the proposed comparator class, and 
therefore such facts, if they were to be considered-- which they are not-- would not change the Court's disposition of the equal 
protection claim. "
463,16," For context, it should also be noted that Avalon and Sea Isle City occupy separate barrier islands off the coast of New Jersey. 
The islands are connected by the Townsends Inlet Bridge. (S.A.C. Ex. A) "
484,1, Additions to the text of the rule are shown by underscoring and deletions of text are shown by strike-through. 
491,1," These are not necessarily the facts. For the purposes of a motion to dismiss, courts take a plaintiff's well-pleaded factual 
allegations as true, without making credibility assessments or engaging in fact-finding. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 677, 129 
S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009)."

493,3," MM's assertion that ""plaintiff cannot have it both ways"" regarding the application of the contracts cuts both ways. If the 2014 
Agreement is not binding—as MM urges—then MM cannot rely on its choice of law provision to dismiss KLS's tort claims. "
494,4," The Colgate doctrine refers to the Supreme Court's teaching in United States v. Colgate & Co., 250 U.S. 300, 39 S. Ct. 465, 63 
L. Ed. 992, 1919 Dec. Comm'r Pat. 460 (1919) that ""a manufacturer has the right to select its customers and refuse to sell its 
goods to anyone for reasons sufficient to itself' without violating the Sherman Act. Burdett Sound, Inc. v. Altec Corp., 515 F.2d 
1245, 1248 (5th Cir. 1975). This is true even if the effect of the change is to ""seriously damage the former distributor's business."" 
Id. at 1249. Since Colgate, courts have repeatedly emphasized the rule. See, e.g., Northwest Power Prods., Inc. v. Omark 
Indus., Inc., 576 F.2d 83 (5th Cir. 1978); Bushie v. Stenocord Corp., 460 F.2d 116 (9th Cir. 1972); Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, 
Inc. v. Hawaiian Oke and Liquors, Ltd., 416 F.2d 71, 78 (9th Cir. 1969)."
494,5," KLS insists that even if this Court finds that its allegations are governed by the rule of reason, it has still alleged an antitrust 
claim. "
495,6," The court in Geneva Pharm. Tech. Corp. v. Barr Labs., Inc., 386 F.3d 485, 496 (2d Cir. 2004) noted that referring to a product 
as a distinct ""submarket"" is essentially another way of defining a market, because the crux of the ""market"" as applied to 
antitrust law is the offered product's interchangeability. Consumer access to a viable substitute is the concern."
495,7," Black's Law Dictionary defines ""state of the art"" to mean the ""total of technical and scientific knowledge that is currently 
available as applied to a product or design."" This does not necessarily exclude all other products; it indicates that VSP is at least 
equal to other substitutable products which may also be state of the art. "
496,8," Both the 2001 Agreement and the 2014 Drafts are subject to Colorado law because as discussed in Section A, both contain 
choice of law clauses adopting Colorado law for contract disputes. "
502,1," Since they were filed in 2013, these cases have been the subject of many judicial decisions. See, e.g., Wai Feng Trading Co. 
Ltd v. Quick Fitting, Inc., C.A. No. 13-33S, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 77672, 2016 WL 4184014 (D.R.I. June 14, 2016); Quick 
Fitting, Inc. v. Wai Feng Trading Co. Ltd., Civil Action No. 13-56S, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 132900, 2015 WL 5775108 (D.R.I. 
June 17, 2015), adopted, No. CA 13-056 S, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 132899, 2015 WL 5775149 (D.R.I. Sept. 30, 2015); Quick 
Fitting, Inc. v. Wai Feng Trading Co., Ltd., No. CA 13-56S, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 131452, 2015 WL 5719503 (D.R.I. Feb. 27, 
2015), adopted, Civil Action No. 13-056 S, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 131451, 2015 WL 5719571 (D.R.I. Sept. 29, 2015); Wai Feng 
Trading Co. Ltd. v. Quick Fitting, Inc., C.A. No. 13-033 S, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 117249, 2014 WL 4199174 (D.R.I. Aug. 22, 
2014). References to these decisions will be by citation, rather than by docket number."
502,2," After considerable wrangling, fact discovery in these cases finally closed on April 15, 2016, with additional time to complete 
specified discovery. Wai Feng Trading, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 77672, 2016 WL 4184014, at *7. The Court held its first summary 
judgment conference on April 10, 2017, and set a briefing schedule. Text Order of May 18, 2017. After briefing began, the Court 
held a second conference and ordered the parties to start over, requiring them first to file the undisputed and disputed facts and 
then to refile the summary judgment briefs once the factual record was settled. Following a third conference, the deadlines were 
extended. Text Orders of Aug. 16, Oct. 20 and Dec. 7, 2017. Additional extensions were also granted. Text Orders of Jan. 8, 
Jan. 24, Feb. 26 and Mar. 30, 2018. The resulting record — including not only the summary judgment record, but also the record 
for the related motions — is massive, amounting to almost seven thousand pages of material. "
503,3," Quick Fitting moved to amend (13-56 ECF No. 178) its complaint after this iteration to add the verification, which had been 
omitted. That motion was granted by text order on February 23, 2016, but the amended pleading was never filed, leaving 13-56 
ECF No. 135 as the operative complaint."
503,4," The cases were initially consolidated, then deconsolidated and eventually reconsolidated. Quick Fitting, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
132899, 2015 WL 5775149, at *1-3."
503,5," The ""Wai Feng parties"" include the plaintiffs in 13-33 and most of the defendants in 13-56. They are: • Wai Feng Trading Co. Ltd. (""Wai Feng Trading""), a Canadian company, and its sometime alter ego, Eastern Foundry & 
Fittings, Inc. (""EFF Inc.""); • EFF Manufactory Co., Ltd. (""EFF Manufactory""), [*5]  a Chinese company sometimes called Ningbo EFF Manufactory 
Co., Ltd. and Ningbo W&F Manufactory Co., Ltd.; • Eastern Foundry & Fittings, LLC (""EFF LLC""), a Massachusetts limited liability company; • Wai Mao Company, Ltd. (""Wai Mao""), a Canadian company; and • Chi Yam Yung (""Andrew Yung""), an individual who resides in Canada and China. EFF LLC, Wai Mao and Andrew Yung are defendants only in 13-56. In addition to the Wai Feng parties, several other 
defendants were named in 13-56 but are not parties. These are: • W&F Manufacturing (""W&F Manufacturing"") was held to be a trade name and not an entity subject to suit, ECF No. 132 at 
13; • Chi Pang Yung (""Jacky Yung""), a citizen of Canada and brother of Andrew Yung, was held not to be subject to personal 
jurisdiction in this District, Quick Fitting, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 131451, 2015 WL 5719571, at *3-4; • Jimmy Yung, the father of Andrew and Jacky Yung, was voluntarily dismissed, 13-56 ECF No. 93; and • Cixi City Wai Feng Ball Valve Company, Ltd. (""CCWFBV""), later known as Ningbo Texoon Brass Works Co., Ltd., a 
Chinese company owned by an uncle of Andrew and Jacky Yung, was never served. Mentioned by the parties, but not named as a party in either case, is a Chinese entity owned by a cousin of Andrew and Jacky 
Yung called Cixi Welday Plastic Products, Co., sometimes referred to as China Welday (""Cixi Welday""). In this report and recommendation, the shorthand names above will be used for each entity even though at various times the 
actual name of the entity may have been different. The Court cautions the reader that the various entities constituting the Wai Feng parties and the other entities listed above not 
only have confoundingly similar names, exacerbated by name changes and alterations of corporate structure during the relevant 
period, but also were repeatedly misidentified in the pleadings and discovery produced in these cases. The resulting confusion 
has been an ongoing issue. See, e.g., Quick Fitting, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 131452, 2015 WL 5719503, at *1-3 & nn.2, 6 (""While 
the Yung companies are responsible for the confusion caused by their use of similar names and by their repeated gaffes in 
misidentifying the appropriate entity, the Court is compelled to observe that Quick Fitting seems to have gone out of its way to 
exacerbate the confusion, perhaps to enhance its veil-piercing argument."")."
503,6," ""Quick Fitting"" is a Rhode Island corporation and is the defendant in 13-33 and the plaintiff in 13-56. "
504,7," Not addressed in this report and recommendation is the Wai Feng parties' motion for judgment with respect to unpaid invoices 
for goods sold and delivered in excess of $400,000, as well as Quick Fitting's claims in 13-56 and counterclaims in 13-33 
alleging that it was damaged because the goods covered by the invoices were unmerchantable and did not conform to the 
parties' agreement. ECF No. 180; 13-56 ECF No. 254. Nor does it address Quick Fitting's cross-motion for summary judgment 
based on its argument that, due to the Wai Feng parties' inter-company transfers and operational switch from Wai Feng Trading 
to EFF Inc., neither Wai Feng Trading, which issued the invoices, nor EFF Manufactory, which manufactured the product to fill 
the purchase orders and shipped the product to Quick Fitting, is entitled to recover. 13-56 ECF No. 259. These matters will be 
addressed in a separate report and recommendation. In addition, the various motions to strike and for a spoliation finding will be 
addressed separately."
504,8," This motion was filed only in 13-56, instead of 13-33. However, it also challenges the counterclaim in 13-33."

Court has used the following protocol for short hand references to the factual record. For citations to the facts and evidence 
marshaled by the Wai Feng parties, the following convention is used: • WF SUF # 1.... ECF No. 172; • WF SUF # 2.... ECF No. 176; • WF SDF # 1.... ECF No. 175; and • WF Ex.... ECF No. 172-1 to 172-45. "
505,," The Wai Feng parties' supporting affidavits are among their exhibits and therefore are not separately listed. For citation to the 
facts and evidence presented by Quick Fitting, the following convention is used: • QF SUF # 1.... ECF No. 173; • QF SUF # 2.... ECF No. 259-3 (13-56); • QF SUF # 3.... ECF No. 189-1; • QF SDF # 1.... ECF No. 177; • QF SDF # 2.... ECF No. 189-4; • QF SDF # 3.... ECF No. 210-1; • QF Ex. # 1.... ECF No. 178-1 to 178-32; • QF Ex. # 2.... ECF No. 259-4 to 259-31 (13-56); • QF Ex. # 3.... ECF Nos. 190-1 to 192-20, 196-1; • Crompton Aff. # 1.... ECF. No. 259-2 (13-56); • Crompton Aff. # 2.... ECF No. 189-2; and • Ochoa Aff....ECF No. 189-3. Quick Fitting's affidavits were not among its exhibits and are cited by the name of the affiant. "
506,11," In his declaration, Andrew Yung averred that the Wai Feng parties created EFF Inc. to take over the business of Wai Feng 
Trading, and that the 2011 NDA was crafted to reflect the change. WF SUF # 1 ¶¶ 14-15. While Quick Fitting disputes the link to 
the 2011 NDA, it is not disputed that, at least as to the Quick Fitting business, Wai Feng Trading continued as the operative 
entity. WF Ex. 2 ¶ 13; WF SUF # 1 ¶ 15."
506,12," The date of the switch is hotly disputed. Quick Fitting's Crompton avers that he was told by Andrew Yung that manufacturing 
for Quick Fitting initially would be done at CCWFBV and that he was shown a different factory from what he understood was 
CCWFBV's factory when he came to observe the operations of EFF Manufactory. Crompton Aff. # 2 ¶¶ 7, 9, 13. Crompton is 
adamant that EFF Manufactory did not take over manufacturing from CCWFBV until April 2011. Id. ¶¶ 12-13. The Wai Feng 
parties are equally vehement that they terminated the manufacturing relationship with CCWFBV in 2008, before their first contact 
with Quick Fitting, and that all manufacturing for Quick Fitting was done at EFF Manufactory. WF SUF # 1 ¶ 6. The date matters 
to the extent that, if Quick Fitting is right, its proprietary designs were provided to CCWFBV so it could (and did) manufacture 
product to be sold to Quick Fitting, while if the Wai Feng parties are right, CCWFBV never had access to Quick Fitting's 
proprietary information because all manufacturing was done by EFF Manufactory. "
507,13," Some items — a small number per the Wai Feng parties, a large number per Quick Fitting — were rejected and returned. WF 
SUF # 1 ¶¶ 64-68; QF SDF #1 ¶ 46. The Wai Feng parties do not seek payment for these items. "
508,14," The third of the three, the 2011 License Agreement, provides that construction of the language against the drafter is waived. 
WF Ex. 11 ¶ 5.18."
508,15," Andrew Yung signed the 2010 License/Supply Agreement without authorization to execute agreements on behalf of CCWFBV. 
Because he signed the 2010 License/Supply Agreement on behalf of an entity for which he lacked authority to sign, and 
because the Agreement subjects signatories to the jurisdiction of this Court, Andrew Yung's defense of lack of personal 
jurisdiction was overruled, making him a party to 13-56 in his personal capacity. Quick Fitting, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 131452, 
2015 WL 5719503, at *7. Andrew Yung's separate summary judgment motion challenging his joinder is addressed infra."
508,16, See n.12 supra. 
509,17," An identical clause came under review in another one of the cases currently pending in this District in which Quick Fitting 
relies on restrictive covenants in an agreement to avoid the accusation by a Chinese supplier that Quick Fitting had failed to pay 
for manufactured product. Quick Fitting, Inc. v. Zhejiang Xingxin Aite Copper Mrg., Co., C.A. No. 11-463WES. In that case, the 
Court found the clause to be ambiguous in the context of a discovery dispute. Text Order of Dec. 27, 2016 (finding ""apparent 
ambiguity"" of ""exclusivity obligation""). See also Yuhuan Jinquan Copper Co., Ltd v. Quick Fitting, C.A. No. 14-243WES."
509,18," The parties dispute when and how the 2010 License/Supply Agreement was terminated. The Wai Feng parties contend that 
they terminated it for cause (based on Quick Fitting's breach) through notice given by their Canadian solicitor on December 7, 
2012. ECF No. 223 at 5; ECF No. 223-1 at 1. Quick Fitting disputes the effectiveness of the Wai Feng parties' letter, claiming 
that it was not written by the right entities. ECF No. 228 at 7-8. For its part, Quick Fitting now contends that the 2010 "
510,," License/Supply Agreement was terminated by operation of law in May 2011, when the parties entered into two new agreements, 
the 2011 NDA and License Agreement. This proposition is contradicted by Crompton's Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(b)(6) testimony that 
the 2011 Agreements were signed to add the name of EFF Manufactory, which had become the manufacturing arm of the Wai 
Feng parties, and that, otherwise the 2010 Agreement continued: ""So the manufacturing arm's name had changed while 
everything else hadn't. So everything else stayed in place, and we created a new agreement surrounding the new manufacturing 
name."" ECF No. 206-5 at 12."
510,19," The Wai Feng parties do not challenge the authenticity of Schedule 2 as part of the 2010 License/Supply Agreement, although 
they do challenge the enforceability of some of its content."
510,20," Nothing is ""indicated below,"" leaving this phrase of the confidentiality clause meaningless. Quick Fitting has admitted that it 
never provided the Wai Feng Parties with a list of customers or even prospective customers to which this prohibition would 
apply. WF SUF # 1 ¶ 82. In his Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(b)(6) deposition, when Crompton was asked whether Quick Fitting ever 
provided this list of the customers covered by this prohibition, he testified: ""I don't know why we would. We would never have 
been required to. That would have never been anything we would have done with them. They were precluded from selling push 
fit, period, whether it was customers or not."" ECF No. 206-7 at 2; see n.22 infra. "
511,21," The Court has previously addressed the confusion over which EFF entity is named in the 2011 NDA. Quick Fitting, 2015 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 131452, 2015 WL 5719503, at *3 (naming of EFF LLC in 2011 NDA ""appears to be wrong . . . EFF LLC apparently 
has nothing to do with the business arrangement with Quick Fitting."")."
511,22," It is undisputed that Quick Fitting never provided any of the Wai Feng parties with a list of entities it considered to be covered 
by this contact ban. WF SUF # 1 ¶ 82. Quick Fitting counters that it regularly communicated with the Wai Feng parties regarding 
the identity at least of its ""customers, markets, and marketing efforts,"" QF SDF # 1 ¶ 82, although it makes no mention of who is 
in the class of ""competitor [or] supplier,"" or how the counter-party to the 2011 NDA would have known what entities were its 
competitors and suppliers. WF Ex. 9 ¶ I(1)(h); see n.20 supra."
511,23," Although EFF Manufactory is identified in the preamble to the Agreement as the ""Supplier,"" and although Quick Fitting's briefs 
repeatedly refer to the 2011 License Agreement as a ""supply"" agreement, e.g., ECF No. 193 at 5 (""2011 License and Supply 
Agreement"") (emphasis added), it is a license agreement with restrictive covenants that contemplates the possibility of a supply 
relationship, but expressly eschews forming one. WF Ex. 11 ¶ 5.2. "
512,24," The 2011 License Agreement defines the covered intellectual property as ""all information provided by Quick Fitting to [EFF 
Manufactory] . . . pertaining to Quick Fitting quick connection valves, fitting and controls,"" as well as to its designs, product 
development, customers, prospects, costs, and financial information. WF Ex. 11 ¶ 1.3. It also includes the identities of customers 
and prospective customers of Quick Fitting ""at any time."" Id. It does not include information that is generally publicly available or 
information that was provided to EFF Manufactory by a third party or information that was independently developed by EFF 
Manufactory. Id. ¶¶ 1.3-1.5."
512,25," No limitation to North America appears in the Agreement. While Quick Fitting has not argued that its restrictive clauses should 
be interpreted as limited to North America based on this testimony, the Court notes that it could not, in that a party cannot 
retroactively make the terms of the non-compete provision palatable by now asserting that it did not plan on enforcing the "
513,," provision as it is written; the acceptance of such a position would effectively allow clauses that violate public policy to flourish 
until confronted by the prospect of litigation and the reality of unenforceability. See Webster Ins., Inc. v. Levine, No. 
X06CV074016194S, 2009 Conn. Super. LEXIS 3431, 2009 WL 5698072, at *3 (Conn. Super. Ct. Apr. 29, 2009). "
514,26, Two of these Section IV clauses (¶¶ 4.3 and 4.4) are challenged as unenforceable. The remainder are not challenged. 
516,27," This argument ignores that ¶ 4.6 is embedded in an Agreement that explicitly provides that Quick Fitting was not obligated to 
purchase any product or to establish EFF Manufactory as a supplier. WF Ex. 11 at 1, ¶ 5.2. "
517,28," Based on this recommendation, I do not address the Wai Feng parties' alternative argument that Quick Fitting never sent the 
contractually mandated ""invoice"" and therefore the $500,000 penalty is not yet due. "
518,29," These provide: (1) A promise to refrain from competition that imposes a restraint that is ancillary to an otherwise valid transaction or 
relationship is unreasonably in restraint of trade if (a) the restraint is greater than is needed to protect the promisee's legitimate interest, or (b) the promisee's need is outweighed by the hardship to the promisor and the likely injury to the public. (2) Promises imposing restraints that are ancillary to a valid transaction or relationship include the following: (a) a promise by the seller of a business not to compete with the buyer in such a way as to injure the value of the 
business sold; (b) a promise by an employee or other agent not to [*49]  compete with his employer or other principal; (c) a promise by a partner not to compete with the partnership. Restatement (Second) Contracts § 188 (1981). "
520,30," The Court observes that, in the extensive briefing of this motion, Quick Fitting dedicated hardly more than one sentence to the 
so-called ""blue-pencil"" rule and did not argue for equitable modification. ECF No. 193 at 22-23. Therefore, if the Court were 
inclined to consider equitable modification, I alternatively recommend that it stay its equitable hand because of Quick Fitting's 
waiver of the issue. Vargas-Colón v. Fundación Damas, Inc., 864 F.3d 14, 24 (1st Cir. 2017) (argument not developed in brief 
need not be considered); see Landrau—Romero v. Banco Popular De Puerto Rico, 212 F.3d 607, 612 (1st Cir. 2000) 
(holding that by failing to sufficiently raise an argument at summary judgment, party has waived it); FERC v. Silkman, 177 F. 
Supp. 3d 683, 696 (D. Mass. 2016) (""[I]ssues which are not raised at an appropriate time may be deemed waived by the 
reviewing tribunal.""). "
521,31," Under the Wai Feng parties' theory of termination, the 2011 License Agreement ended in December 2015. See ECF No. 223 
at 5-6."
521,32," In light of the mandate in the 2011 License Agreement that unenforceable clauses must be severed (WF Ex. 11 ¶ 5.21) and 
because Quick Fitting's legitimate interests are well protected by the unchallenged clauses, I find equitable modification is not 
necessary and do not recommend it. "
522,33," Watts had been a ten-year-long customer of the Wai Feng parties when the push-fit discussions in issue began in October 
2012 (months after the termination of the Quick Fitting relationship). WF Ex. 18 at 2-3. The evidence establishes that, over 
several months in 2013, Watts solicited EFF Manufactory for quotes on what Watts described either as ""quick fit fittings"" or by 
reference to Quick Fitting product names or numbers. QF Exs. # 3 UU, VV, WW. Andrew Yung brought a sample push-fit item to 
a meeting with Watts, which had been manufactured for Quick Fitting. QF Ex. # 3 WW at 28-31. The participants in these 
discussions claim they were focused on a plastic push-fit design to be developed on Watts's specifications and designs. WF Ex. 
18 at 6-7. Watts never proceeded with the business. Id."
522,34," In 2013, well after the Quick Fitting/Wai Feng parties' relationship ended, John Biduk, a representative of the Bow Group 
visited a facility of the Wai Feng parties and spoke with Andrew Yung, who ""volunteered"" that he was ""in the process of 
developing a product line"" of metal push-fit plumbing products. QF Ex. #3 AAA at 3. Biduk told Andrew that Bow would be 
interested once the products were ready — ""call me when you have all your ducks lined up."" Id. at 4. Biduk also visited Bow's 
existing supplier, Cixi Welday; he testified to a hearsay statement that Cixi Welday and EFF Manufactory were collaborating on 
development of a push-fit product line. Id. at 4. The Bow Group never placed any orders with the Wai Feng parties. Id. at 13."
522,35," Paul Bell, the Mueller buyer, testified that after contracting to purchase Chinese-manufactured push-fit from Quick Fitting, 
Mueller was able to land the mega-retailer, Lowe's, as a customer. QF Ex. #3 OO at 12-13. In 2011, Bell and his Chinese 
assistant, Lisia Wang, toured China. One of the stops Wang arranged was at EFF Manufactory, where Bell observed the 
manufacturing of Quick Fitting push-fit to be sold to Mueller. Because Bell was ""in the process of building a relationship and 
business with Quick Fitting[,]"" he talked with Andrew Yung about the product. Id. at 31. According to Bell, Andrew was ""very 
proud of the fact that he was making the Quick Fitting product"" and acknowledged that EFF Manufactory was ""under contract, 
that they were in a, a contract with [Quick Fitting]."" Id. at 31-33. While Bell wondered if EFF Manufactory would sell push-fit to 
Mueller directly, he knew Quick Fitting ""was protected, and from either a legal standpoint . . . [Crompton's] product was protected 
from either a, a legal side, a contract, or patent protection,"" in addition to the exclusivity restrictions in Mueller's own three-year 
agreement with Quick Fitting. Id. ""[B]ecause [he] did not want to be obvious,"" id. at 32, Bell had Mueller's attorneys investigate 
Quick Fitting's patents ""to understand if we could get around them if we were so inclined,"" id. at 46, and he asked Wang to get 
pricing information and find out if EFF Manufactory would sell directly. Id. at 31-33, 38 & 72-73. His goal was to explore getting 
lower prices, ""price test[ing],"" which he did ""all the time."" Id. at 73. He never communicated directly with Andrew Yung or with 
any of the Wai Feng parties regarding this inquiry. Id. at 87. Rather, all communication (if there was any) was through a non-
testifying declarant (Wang); Quick Fitting and the Wai Feng parties have submitted inconsistent hearsay declarations regarding 
Wang's account of the facts. Compare QF Ex. # 3 OO at 39-44, with WF Ex. 16. Ultimately, Bell testified that he received a price 
list; based on his review of whatever it really was, he was satisfied that the prices Mueller was being charged by Quick Fitting 
were ""reasonable."" Id. at 47, 83, 98. Mueller continued to buy push-fit from Quick Fitting at increasing volumes, although Quick 
Fitting claims it was not able to increase Mueller's prices. ECF No. 206-7 at 4-5; QF Ex. # 3 OO at 69-70, 97; Crompton Aff. # 2 
¶¶ 23-24. "
523,36," The closest to an actual sale occurred in July 2012, just as the Wai Fang parties' relationship with Quick Fitting was ending. 
Mueller's Bell testified about a chart (QF Ex. # 3 PP) prepared at Mueller analyzing pricing for PEX products (which are not 
push-fit) from several suppliers, including EFF Manufactory. QF Ex. # 3 OO at 52-53. Bell did not prepare the chart and did not 
know the source of the pricing information in it. Although the focus of the chart was PEX, two of the items (of over 150) for which 
a price is shown for EFF Manufactory were push-fit products of the type sold to Mueller by Quick Fitting, although Bell insisted 
he considered them to be ""tied specifically to the PEX program, . . . not tied to a push-fit program."" Id. at 53. The evidence does 
not reveal whether either of the two items was actually sold to Mueller."
523,37," See n.35 supra. According to Crompton, sometime in 2012, he received a call from Mueller's Bell, who told him, ""[w]e have 
pricing from one of your factories and they're claiming they can sell us directly [sic], they're not impeded by any contract or 
agreement."" ECF No. 206-7 at 4. Bell told Crompton he had gotten pricing proposals to sell directly not only from EFF 
Manufactory, but also from two of Quick Fitting's other Chinese suppliers (Xxat and Jinquan). Id. at 3. To salvage the Mueller 
relationship, Quick Fitting executives traveled to Mueller, apparently in 2013. Crompton Aff. # 2 ¶ 22; QF Ex. # 3 SS; see QF Ex. 
# 3 OO at 82-83. Quick Fitting retained Mueller as a customer and increased the volume of the business. QF Ex. # 3 OO at 69-
70. Notably, Quick Fitting ended up in litigation with all three of the Chinese suppliers accused by Bell. See n.17 supra."
523,38," Quick Fitting claims that Cixi Welday was provided with push-fit drawings in order to manufacture plastic components for the 
finished products sold to Quick Fitting. Crompton Aff. # 2 ¶¶ 26-27; QF Ex. # 3 W at 33-35. Such an arrangement appears to 
have been contemplated by the 2011 License Agreement. WF Ex. 11 ¶¶ 1.5, 2.2. Nevertheless, Quick Fitting now argues that it 
constitutes a breach. For a later period, in 2013, there is testimony that the Wai Feng parties and Cixi Welday were collaborating 
to develop a line of push-fit products. See n.34 supra; QF Ex. # 3 AAA at 4. Later still, in 2014, Crompton saw Andrew Yung at 
the Cixi Welday trade show booth where there were push-fit samples on display, as well as a product sheet with photographs of 
push fit products. Crompton Aff. # 2 ¶ 28; QF Ex. # 3 NN. Relatedly, Quick Fitting proffers the expert opinion of its Vice President 
of Engineering, Libardo Ochoa, who claims he examined two unauthenticated items — a photograph and a drawing — 
ostensibly submitted in 2013 by Cixi Welday for certification of two push-fit products. Ochoa Aff. ¶¶ 7-9. The Wai Feng parties 
have moved both to strike the Ochoa Affidavit incorporating this opinion and to exclude the Ochoa expert opinion. ECF Nos. 182 
& 205. The motions are under advisement."
523,39," Quick Fitting has proffered circumstantial evidence that CCWFBV was the manufacturer. In their briefs, the Wai Feng parties 
argue persuasively that every such fragment is readily explained away. At bottom, the best evidence of the charge that 
CCWFBV was the manufacturer for the first year of the relationship is the slim reed of its naming in the 2010 License/Supply 
Agreement that Andrew Yung signed. "
524,40," The evidence of push-fit sales over Alibaba either by CCWFBV or the Wai Feng parties is less than paper-thin. Quick Fitting 
proffers an unauthenticated screen shot purportedly showing CCWFBV offering push-fit for sale through the Alibaba website. QF 
Ex. # 3 QQQ. It also relies on a set of unauthenticated inquiries sent in 2014 through the Alibaba website to the Wai Feng 
parties from various locations in the world (e.g., India, Zimbabwe) asking for quotes on push-fit products. QF Ex. # 3 BBB. After 
being pressed at the hearing about these exhibits, Quick Fitting conceded in its post-hearing brief that they prove nothing 
beyond ""context and background to Mr. Crompton's state of mind."" ECF No. 228 at 7. "
525,41," The 2011 License Agreement is ambiguous regarding whether the price Quick Fitting was charged by the Wai Feng parties 
was confidential. Compare WF Ex. 11 ¶ 1.3 (""Confidential Information"" includes ""costs, and financial information,"" as well as 
customer ""payment information""; prices charged by Wai Feng parties not expressly mentioned), with id. ¶ 1.4 (""Confidential 
Information"" does not include information ""developed"" by EFF Manufactory)."
525,42," This is not a case where Wang's hearsay declaration that Andrew Yung said the Wai Feng parties would sell to Mueller 
directly, as described by Bell, has indicia of trustworthiness sufficient to meet Fed. R. Evid. 807, particularly where it is 
contradicted by Wang's other hearsay declaration, WF Ex. 16, and is inconsistent with the admissible declarations of Andrew 
Yung described by Bell. QF Ex. # 3 OO at 31-33 (""[Andrew Yung] was very proud of the fact that he was making push-fit for 
Quick Fitting.""); id. at 33 (""that [the Wai Feng parties] were a partner with Quick Fitting, that they were under contract""). "
526,43, See n.35 supra.
526,44," This evidence includes Cixi Welday's pre-2013 lack of experience in metal manufacturing, the close relationship between Cixi 
Welday's principal and Andrew Yung, Cixi Welday's involvement with supplying components for the Quick Fitting push-fit 
products manufactured by EFF Manufactory and the timing of the announcement of a venture for Cixi Welday to offer metal 
push-fit."
526,45," One loose end: the Wai Feng parties have argued that the exclusivity clause in the 2010 License/Supply Agreement, WF Ex. 4 
¶ 4(c), was undisputedly breached by Quick Fitting's purchase of push-fit from other vendors and that this prior breach voided all 
of the contractual obligations imposed on the Wai Feng parties so that judgment should enter in their favor. Having found that 
this exclusivity clause is ambiguous, see n.17 supra, I do not recommend that the Court enter judgment on this basis. "
527,46," Crompton's second affidavit is consistent either with the Wai Feng parties' contention that EFF Inc. was intended to be the 
counter-party or with the proposition that the 2011 NDA was intended to name EFF Manufactory. Crompton Aff. # 2 ¶¶ 12-13. 
Crompton averred that he forwarded the 2011 NDA for execution to Andrew Yung because he had been told in early 2011 that a 
Canadian entity called ""EFF"" was being formed to take over the ""manufacturing operations formerly handled by the 'W&F 
Manufacturing' factory."" Id. Crompton's averments rule out EFF LLC as the proper party. QF SDF # 1 ¶ 18."
527,47," To overcome this lack of evidence, Quick Fitting points to the inadvertent use of the EFF LLC logo on some emails from 
Andrew Yung and to the use of the EFF LLC name on an email from a Canadian-based employee, both involving matters related 
to the Quick Fitting relationship. QF SUF # 3 ¶¶ 40-56. However, there is no suggestion that Quick Fitting was ever lead to 
believe it was dealing with EFF LLC or that Andrew Yung or the Canadian-based employee were actually acting for EFF LLC. 
See WF SUF # 1 ¶¶ 163, 165."
527,48," This Court has previously considered and declined to accept Quick Fitting's veil-piercing theory: Whether considering the law of Rhode Island, where ""courts are loath to act like Vlad the Impaler,"" Doe v. Gelineau, 732 
A.2d 43, 44 (R.I. 1999), or the law of Canada, China or Massachusetts, courts are universally hesitant to disregard 
independent corporate structure and typically require clear evidence to justify doing so. Russell v. Enter. Rent-A-Car Co. of 
R.I., 160 F. Supp. 2d 239, 250-51 (D.R.I. 2001). Quick Fitting has not only failed to present clear and convincing evidence, 
but has not even established prima facie proof of any of the markers that lead courts to ignore the separate existence of the 
corporate entity. Specifically, it has offered no evidence of the use of a sham entity, of undercapitalization, of the lack of 
corporate records, of insolvency, or of the improper use of the corporate form by dominant shareholders. Quick Fitting, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 131452, 2015 WL 5719503, at *10 (footnotes omitted). While the Wai Feng parties have 
reinforced the factual record establishing the separate corporate existence of EFF LLC, WF SUF # 1 ¶¶ 143-157, Quick Fitting 
has added nothing material to the summary judgment record to fill the hole already found by the Court. QF SDF # 1 ¶¶ 149-151, "
528,154," ; see Baker v. LivaNova PLC, 210 F. Supp. 3d 642, 646 (M.D. Pa. 2016) (use of common logos and email domains not 
enough to pierce corporate veil). Quick Fitting's veil-piercing facts remain insufficient to meet any of Gelineau factors. "
529,49," When the discovery of this possible jurisdictional defect was made, the Court considered whether to halt work and ask the 
parties to brief the issue of the citizenship of EFF LLC and its impact on subject matter jurisdiction. That option was not chosen 
because most of the issues covered in this report and recommendation are pending in both 13-33 and 13-56 so the resulting 
delay would further protract the progress of 13-33 towards trial, and because of the option to dismiss EFF LLC pursuant to Fed. 
R. Civ. P. 21 discussed infra. Instead, with the uncertainty regarding jurisdiction over 13-56 an open question, I have flagged the 
problem and otherwise laid out my recommendations to give the parties the opportunity to address subject matter jurisdiction in 
their objections or otherwise as the District Court determines is most appropriate."
529,50," Rule 19(b) provides: [T]he court must determine whether, in equity and good conscience, the action should proceed among the existing parties 
or should be dismissed. The factors for the court to consider include: (1) the extent to which a judgment rendered in the person's absence might prejudice that person or the existing parties; (2) the extent to which any prejudice could be lessened or avoided by: (A) protective provisions in the judgment; (B) shaping the relief; or (C) other measures; (3) whether a judgment rendered in the person's absence would be adequate; and (4) whether the plaintiff would have an adequate remedy if the action were dismissed for nonjoinder. Fed. R. Civ. P. 19(b). "
530,51," The Court disposes only of part of this motion in this report and recommendation. In addition to the tort claims listed in the text, 
the motion also attacks the viability of Quick Fitting's claims that the push-fit products that it accepted but failed to pay for were 
nonconforming, defective or negligently manufactured. That aspect of the motion will be addressed in a separate report and 
recommendation. See n.7 supra. "
531,52," With a record replete with references to the confidential nature of Quick Fitting's drawings and ambiguity as to whether any or 
all are disclosed in a patent, the Wai Feng parties' argument that a patent-protected drawing is not a trade secret functions as a 
red herring."
531,53," For example, any sharing of the trade secrets among CCWFBV, EFF Manufactory or Cixi Welday, as necessary for the 
purpose of manufacturing the push-fit products for sale to Quick Fitting, does not amount to misappropriation as the term is 
defined by the Trade Secrets Act. R.I. Gen. Laws § 6-41-1(2). Nor does Quick Fitting's claim that the Wai Feng parties breached 
their contractual duty of non-disclosure by allowing Mueller's buyer to get access to Quick Fitting's prices; the prices that the Wai 
Feng parties charged Quick Fitting are not a trade secret under the Trade Secrets Act because they were not ""acquired"" or 
""derived"" from another entity. R.I. Gen. Laws § 6-41-1(2)(ii)(B)(II-III). And even if Quick Fitting can prove that Cixi Welday really 
used a Quick Fitting drawing to design a product, with no evidence that such a product was ever sold, it is questionable whether

both assigned certain rights to FLH, including the right to recover any amounts payable on their assets, as well as the right to 
commence suit in Sonterra's and FrontPoint's names. (Id. at 1-2.) Plaintiffs contend that the substitution of FLH for Sonterra and 
FrontPoint would not affect any of the substantive factual or legal allegations in the CAC, (Id. at 2); Defendants disagree, (Doc. 
172). Because I conclude that Sonterra's claims fail for reasons other than their lack of capacity to sue, Plaintiffs' request for

that its jurisdictional provisions may apply at all."" (Defs.' PJX Br. 27 n.32.) Plaintiffs did not address this assertion in their 
opposition brief, (see generally, Pls.' PJX Opp.), perhaps because Defendants made the assertion in a footnote and 
""[a]rguments which appear in footnotes are generally deemed to have been waived[,]"" see In re Crude Oil Commodity Litigation, 
No. 06 Civ. 6677(NRB), 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 66208, 2007 WL 2589482, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 7, 2007). Defendants do not 
elaborate on this conclusory statement or provide any argument in support of it. (Defs. PJC Br. 27 n.32.) At any rate, Plaintiffs "
592,," have at least arguably alleged that venue is proper because they allege that UBS is found or ""transacts business"" in New York. 
15 U.S.C. § 22 (a suit may be brought under the Clayton Act ""in any district wherein [a defendant] may be found or transacts 
business""); (CAC ¶ 79 (""UBS maintains branches and representative offices in several U.S. states, including . . . New York. 
UBS's U.S. headquarters are located in New York and Stamford, Connecticut."").)"
592,29," ""3/14/17 Ltr."" refers to Defendants' letter filed on March 14, 2017. (Doc. 135.) "
593,30," The page of the UBS/CFTC agreement cited by Plaintiffs in support of Paragraph 85 discusses the manipulation of both U.S. 
Dollar LIBOR submissions and of LIBOR submissions generally. In other words, the UBS/CFTC agreement does not specifically 
state that Stamford-based UBS manager manipulated Sterling LIBOR. Therefore, based on this ambiguity, it is not entirely clear 
that the Stamford-based UBS manager manipulated Sterling LIBOR, as opposed to Dollar LIBOR or LIBOR in some other 
currency. Because I am considering a motion to dismiss, I must accept the allegations in the CAC as true and draw all 
inferences in Plaintiffs' favor. Therefore, I resolve this ambiguity in Plaintiffs' favor, and draw the reasonable inference that when 
the agreement references ""LIBOR submissions"" without specifying a currency, Sterling LIBOR submissions are included in those 
references."
593,31," Once minimum contacts with the forum have been established, ""the burden shifts to the defendant to show that the exercise of 
jurisdiction would nonetheless be so unreasonable as to offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice."" LIBOR IV, 
2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 147561, 2015 WL 6243526, at *28 (citing Asahi Metal Indus. Co. v. Superior Court of Cal., Solano Cty., 
480 U.S. 102, 113, 107 S. Ct. 1026, 94 L. Ed. 2d 92 (1987)). The defendant must ""present a compelling case that the presence "
594,," of some other considerations would render jurisdiction unreasonable."" Burger King, 471 U.S. at 477. Defendants' only argument 
that the exercise of personal jurisdiction would be unreasonable is that they ""had no suit-related connections with the forum."" 
(See Defs.' PJX Br. 28-29.) This is merely a statement that the first requirement for specific personal jurisdiction has not been 
met. Defendants fail to meet their burden because they do not point to any evidence that the exercise of personal jurisdiction 
would be unreasonable as to UBS or any other Defendant. "
602,1," The Court notes that TMT alleges several violations of state antitrust laws in its Second Amended Complaint but has since 
limited Count 1 to allege only a ""refusal to deal"" claim. (Poley Aff., Ex. 31, 2018 TMT Dep. at 40:16 - 24; 43:22-45:6.)"

624,1," ""Merz"" refers to three entities, all named as Defendants in the Complaint: Merz GmbH & Co. KGaA, Merz Pharma GmbH & Co. 
KGaA, and Merz Pharmaceuticals GmbH. "
625,2," The IPP's Complaint includes four counts, with dozens of state law claims under each count. I recognize that plaintiffs will 
sometimes style their complaints this way. Frankly, however, each of these state law claims should be its own cause of action, 
such that the IPP Complaint would properly contain 123 separate counts."

625,4," Unless otherwise noted, all references herein are to the docket in Sergeants Benevolent Association Health & Welfare Fund v. 
Actavis, plc, No. 15-CV-6549 (S.D.N.Y.). "
629,5," Allergan plc was formerly known as Actavis, plc. (See In re Namenda Direct Purchaser Antitrust Litig., No 18-2421 (2d Cir.), 
Dkt. No. 1 at 2 (corporate disclosure statement).) This opinion uses ""Actavis throughout to reflect the fact that the IPP has not 
moved for a substitution of parties in the IP Action."
629,6," The DPPs subsequently dismissed all three Merz entities from the DP Action on April 20, 2017. (15-cv-7488, Dkt. No. 207.) 
They remain parties to the IP Action, however. "
630,7," The IPP does not, however, bring claims under the laws of all 11 states. (Compare CAC ¶ 15 with CAC ¶¶ 201, 207, 215, 226.) "
633,8," It is not clear from the face of the IPP Complaint how Forest was able to obtain a five-year patent extension, the maximum 
permitted, when the FDA approval process for the Namenda IRNDA allegedly took only one year. "
634,9," Plaintiff Rochester Drug Co-Operative, Inc., also filed a complaint on behalf of direct purchasers that did not name the Generic 
Defendants. (15-CV-10083, Dkt. No. 1.) On January 26, 2016, Plaintiffs JM Smith Corporation and Rochester Drug Co-
Operative, Inc. stipulated to consolidating the cases. (15-cv-7488, Dkt No 65.)"
634,10," As discussed, Merz did not join the motion for consolidated briefing, (Dkt. No. 63 at 2 n. 1), but later joined Actavis and 
Forest's brief, (Dkt. No. 85). "
635,11," This Court had previously ordered that ""the Indirect Purchaser Plaintiff's claims are severed and placed on the Court's 
suspense calendar."" Namenda III, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 128349, 2016 WL 4992690, at *17 (emphasis added). The use of the 
word ""sever,"" however, did not connote that the cases had been consolidated under Rule 42(a) or joined for purposes of Rules 
18 and 19. "
637,12," Generic Defendants also argue that Illinois Brick bars the IPP's claims under two additional states—Illinois and Oregon—
under Count One. (Gen. Defs. Suppl. Br. at 10-11.) However, the IPP Complaint does not allege Illinois and Oregon claims 
under Count One; instead, it alleges them only under Count Two. (See CAC ¶ 201.) This Court therefore addresses the Illinois 
and Oregon arguments in the portion of the opinion that discusses Count Two. "
638,13," Later, in Namenda V, this Court ultimately found that the DPPs, which were drug wholesalers, could rely on classwide 
economic models at trial to show that they had suffered antitrust injury. Namenda V, 331 F. Supp. 3d at 177. In addition, 
although the DPPs had originally moved for collateral estoppel on Count One against Actavis, Forest, and Merz, (15-cv-7488, 
Dkt. No. 134), the parties subsequently stipulated to the dismissal of Merz from the action, (15-cv-7488, Dkt. No. 207). In an 
accident of timing, therefore, Merz was dismissed after the parties had submitted briefing on the collateral estoppel motion but 
before this Court had ruled on that motion."
638,14," Merz would also not be collaterally estopped from arguing that, under the facts alleged in the IPP Complaint, it had absolutely 
nothing to do with the hard switch, However, likely because Merz chose to be represented by the same counsel as Actavis and 
Forest, and likely because these parties chose to submit a consolidated brief in support of their motions to dismiss both the DPP 
and IPP Complaints, Merz never raised this argument separate and apart from Actavis and Forest. (See Forest Br. at 15-33.) 
The Court therefore does not address it. "
644,15," The Generic Defendants adopt this argument in Actavis, Forest, and Merz's brief with their own footnote: ""For the reasons set 
forth in Forest's motion to dismiss, Plaintiff's claims are also barred by the statute of limitations."" (Gen. Defs. Br. at 50 n.27.) My 
holding above applies equally to the Generic Defendants."
644,16," The iPP Complaint does not allege any claim under Georgia law, under any of Counts One through Four. (CAC ¶¶ 191-231.)"
644,17," The IPP Complaint does not allege any claim under Pennsylvania law, under any of Counts One through Four. (CAC ¶¶ 191-
231.) "
645,18," Defendants also argue that any states that have not expressly adopted or rejected Illinois Brick should be treated as barring 
indirect purchaser claims. (Gen. Defs. Br. at 36 n.16 (citing In re Digital Music Antitrust Litig., 812 F. Supp. 2d 390, 413 (S.D.N.Y. 
2011).) However, Defendants have not indicated which states these would be. "
647,19," Since this provision governs prostitution offenses, and since Count Two cites the Utah Antitrust Act at Utah Code §§ 76-10-
3101, et seq., (CAC P 207(x)), the Court once again assumes this is a typographical error. "
648,20," Although this Court would ordinarily proceed through the state law claims in alphabetical order there exits much more fulsome 
case law regarding the pre-suit notice requirement under the Hawaii Antitrust Act than there does for any of the other states. "
650,21," Although Actavis, Forest, and Merz purport to seek dismissal of the IPP's monopolization claims at CAC ¶¶ 207(e) 207(p) and 
207(w), those paragraph numbers actually correspond to Count Two of the IPP Complaint—conspiracy to monopolize—which is 
not unilateral conduct by definition. As it has several times throughout this opinion the Court assumes that this is a typographical 
error, and it treats the pleadings as if Actavis, Forest, and Merz instead move to dismiss the equivalent state law claims under 
Count One of the IPP Complaint. "
654,22," By way of background, I note briefly that the Court did not previously have occasion to consider the conspiracy issue in the DP 
Action. The DP Action did not expressly assert conspiracy as a cause of action, (15-cv-7488, Did. No. 29 ¶¶ 237-65), and the 
DPPs later informed the Court that they had abandoned any ""inter-generic conspiracy claim"" raised under Count IV of their 
Complaint, Namenda V, 331 F. Supp. 3d 152, 2018 WL 3970674, at *25. "
662,23," Defendants also argue that the DCCPPA require plaintiffs to allege deceptive conduct, (Forest Br. at 67 n.47), and is 
inapplicable to antitrust conduct, (Forest Br. at 68 n.49; Gen. Defs. Br at 40 n. 19) However because the Court dismisses the 
DCCPPA claim under Count Three for failure to state a claim based on a retail purchase for personal, family, or household 
purposes, it does not reach these arguments. "
665,24," Defendants also argue that the KCPA bars class actions (Gen. Defs. Br. at 39 n.18; Forest Br. at 68 n.53); that the statute 
requires plaintiffs to allege a consumer transaction or conduct that is consumer-oriented (Forest Br. at 67-68 n.48); that the 
statute is inapplicable to antitrust conduct (Gen. Defs. Br. at 40; Forest Br. at 68 n.49); and that the statute only allows suits by 
consumers who are natural persons with regard to transactions made primarily for personal or household purposes (Forest Br. at 
68 n.51). However, because the Court dismisses the KCPA claim on the grounds that it is inapplicable to antitrust conduct, it 
does not reach these arguments."
665,25," Defendants also argue that the MUPTA requires a showing of consumer deception. (Forest Br. at 67 n.47.) However, because 
the Court dismisses the MUPTA claim on the grounds that Sergeants Benevolent has failed to state a claim based on purchases 
made ""primarily for personal, family, or household purposes,"" it does not reach these arguments. "
668,26," Defendants also argue that the MUTPCPA does not permit class actions. (Forest Br. at 68 n.53.) However, because the Court 
dismisses the MUTPCPA claim on the grounds that Sergeants Benevolent has failed to state a claim based on purchases made 
""primarily for personal, family, or household purposes,"" it does not reach these arguments. "
670,27," Defendants also argue that NYGBL § 349 requires a plaintiff to allege a consumer transaction or conduct that is consumer-
oriented, (Forest Br. at 67-68 n.48), and that the statute covers only conduct that is primarily intrastate, (Forest Br. at 68 n.50; 
Gen. Defs. Br. at 40-41 n.20). However, because the Court dismisses the NYGBL § 349 claim for failure to plead deceptive or 
fraudulent conduct, it does not reach these arguments. "
671,28," Defendants also argue that the RIDTPA requires a showing of consumer deception, (Forest Br, at 67 n.47), and is inapplicable 
to antitrust conduct, (Forest Br, at 68 n.49). However, because the Court dismisses the RIDTPA claim on the grounds that 
Sergeants Benevolent has failed to state a claim based on purchases made ""primarily for personal, family, or household 
purposes,"" it does not reach these arguments."
671,29," Defendants also argue that the TCPA requires a showing of consumer deception (Forest Br. at 67 n.47) and that the statute 
does not permit class actions (Forest Br. at 68 n.53; Gen. Defs. Br. 39 n.18.) However, because the Court dismisses the TCPA 
claim as inapplicable to antitrust conduct, it does not reach these arguments. "
674,30," Defendants also argue that the WVCCPA requires plaintiffs to allege deceptive conduct, (Forest Br. at 67 n.47); requires 
plaintiffs to plead a consumer transaction or conduct that is consumer-oriented, (Forest Br. at 67-68 n.48); and is inapplicable to 
antitrust conduct, (Forest Br. at 68 n.49; Gen. Defs. Br. at 40 n.19). However, because the Court dismisses the WVCCPA claim 
for failure to serve a cure offer on the Defendants prior to initiating the lawsuit, it does not reach these arguments. "
676,31," Again, most likely due to their decision to retain the same counsel and to submit a brief jointly with Forest, Actavis and Merz 
have not challenged the unjust enrichment claims under Count Four on the basis that no benefit from the overcharges on 
Namenda flowed to them, so the Court will not raise and address this argument sua sponte. "
677,32," The Restatement (Third) of Restitution and Unjust Enrichment states, ""While the paradigm case of unjust enrichment is one in 
which the benefit on one side of the transaction corresponds to an observable loss on the other, the consecrated formula at the 
expense of another' can also mean in violation of the other's legally protected rights,' without the need to show that the claimant 
has suffered a loss."" Restatement (Third) of Restitution and Unjust Enrichment § 1 (2011). The IPP presumably could have 
chosen to rely upon this theory to prosecute its claims of unjust enrichment. However, the IPP has also stated expressly in its 
Complaint and in briefing that it conferred a benefit on Generic Defendants in the form of overcharges, so the Court does not 
reach this question."
677,33," Because Actavis, Forest, and Merz adopt the Generic Defendants' briefing in whole, this Court continues to refer to Generic 
Defendants' briefs, even though these defendants were dismissed from Count Four. "
701,*," Pursuant to 5TH CIR. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except 
under the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH CIR. R. 47.5.4. "
710,1," Given the sheer number of statements addressed in this Order, the Court summarizes that those which contain specific 
representations have survived the motion to dismiss, as have the allegations regarding UpCounsel's fee structure. "
711,2," Specifically, LegalForce RAPC asserts all three claims, while Trademarkia asserts only a claim under the UCL. "
712,3," Those groups include: ""behind-the-scenes HTML source code or 'search engine optimization' ('SEO') efforts,"" ""quotes 
suggesting that UpCounsel is 'equivalent to the world's largest virtual law firm' or that available lawyers are, for example, the 
'best patent lawyers' in a particular city,"" ""whether UpCounsel's fee structure is 'false and misleading,'"" and ""serious but spurious 
allegations that some lawyers advertised on UpCounsel's website are 'not even licensed to practice law' in a particular state, or 
in any state."" (See MTD at 9-10.)"
712,4, Any statements not addressed herein are those that were not clearly the subject of UpCounsel's motion to dismiss.
712,5," UpCounsel also argues as a general matter that ""[p]laintiffs cannot rest their Lanham Act claims on UpCounsel's executives' 
statements, both as a matter of fact and as a matter of law."" (MTD at 13.) It cites L.A. Taxi Cooperative, Inc. v. Uber 
Technologies, Inc., 114 F. Supp. 3d 852 (N.D. Cal. 2015) in support thereof. However, that case is distinguishable because the 
challenged statements, which were made by Uber representatives to journalists and published in independent online articles, 
were ""'inextricably intertwined' with the reporters' coverage of a matter of public concern, i.e. whether Uber is safe for riders[.]"" 
Id. at 864 (emphasis supplied). For this reason, the court in L.A. Taxi determined that the statements could not constitute 
commercial speech actionable under the Lanham Act. Unlike the statements in L.A. Taxi, the challenged statements here do not 
implicate matters of public concern. Thus, this argument fails, and the Court does not address it further. "

715,13," UpCounsel cites Hackett v. Feeney, No. 2:09-cv-02075-RLH-LRL, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 101485, 2011 WL 4007531 (D. Nev. 
Sept. 8, 2011) in support of its argument that, in order to be actionable under the Lanham Act, the statement must answer the 
""critical question '[Top 5%] as determined by whom[?]'"" (Reply at 11 (emphasis supplied).) However, that case is distinguishable. 
First, it involves a #1 claim, namely ""Voted #1 Best Show in Vegas!"" 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 101485, [WL] at *4; see also In re 
Century 21-RE/MAX Real Estate Advert. Claims Litig., 882 F. Supp. 915, 923 (C.D. Cal. 1994) (""The word[] . . . '#1' convey[s] no 
specific meaning and thus cannot be considered literally false.""). Moreover, the full quote from Hackett cited by UpCounsel 
provides: ""the[] words (voted, considered, rated, etc.) in combination with '#1 Best Show in Vegas' begs the question: By 
whom?"" Hackett, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 101485, 2011 WL 4007531, at *5 (emphasis supplied). Here, unlike in Hackett, none of 
the 5% statements say UpCounsel was voted/considered/rated as top 5%. Moreover, the ""#1 Best Show in Vegas"" statement at 
issue in Hackett is classic puffery because it made no reference to the category in which the show ""The Rat Pack is Back"" was 
number one. Here, on the other hand, the 5% statement specifies a particular category as to which the 5% statement applies, 
namely the specific practice area. It cannot be said that no reasonable consumer would rely on such an assertion. UpCounsel also cites Southland Sod Farms v. Stover Seed Co., 108 F.3d 1134 (9th Cir. 1997) in its reply brief, arguing that 
""[m]ost of"" plaintiffs' ""supposedly false claims"" are ""general assertions and vague claims of 'lower costs and superiority' . . . ."" 
(Defendant UpCounsel Inc.'s Reply in Support of Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint (""Reply"") at 11, Dkt. No. 
59.) However, for the reasons discussed herein, the Court disagrees and finds that they are instead ""quantifiable"" and/or ""make[] 
a claim as to the specific or absolute characteristics"" of UpCounsel's services, provided by the attorneys who use its platform. 
Newcal Indus., Inc. v. Ikon Office Sol., 513 F.3d 1038, 1053 (9th Cir. 2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). "
719,14," As for UpCounsel's argument regarding the corresponding search results, the fact that plaintiffs formulated the searches which 
triggered the results is of no moment. UpCounsel does not dispute that the search results and information contained therein are 
accessible to the broader public. As previously stated, the issue of who actually made the statements (i.e., the search results), 
whether it be UpCounsel or a third party, is a factual issue to be resolved at summary judgment. (See supra p. 10.) "
720,15," UpCounsel's motion actually makes these arguments as to ""plaintiffs,"" i.e., both LegalForce RAPC and Trademarkia. 
However, only LegalForce RAPC asserts a claim under the FAL. (See FAC at p. 42 (indicating that the FAL claim is asserted 
""[a]gainst UpCounsel by RAPC"").) UpCounsel's standing argument in the context of the FAL claim therefore pertains to 
LegalForce RAPC only, and the Court thus proceeds with its discussion accordingly."
720,16, See also discussion at infra pp. 19-20. 
721,17," Moreover, because UpCounsel's standing point at oral argument was limited to Trademarkia's purported injuries, and because 
the Court previously ruled on the issue of plaintiffs' standing under the UCL, (see Dkt. No. 42 at 2), the Court limits its discussion 
herein accordingly. Thus, the Court does not address the causation or redressability requirements of Article III standing. "
722,18," See Kwikset, 51 Cal. 4th at 325 (""If a party has alleged or proven a personal, individualized loss of money or property in any 
nontrivial amount, he or she has also alleged or proven injury in fact.""). "
724,19," Citing section 6156, UpCounsel similarly moves to dismiss plaintiffs' UCL claim based on a violation of section 6152 ""because 
that code section specifically provides for enforcement actions by public entities . . . or the State Bar of California[.]"" (MTD at 5-6 
(emphasis removed).) However, section 6156 references violations of section 6155 only, and not violations of section 6152. See 
Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 6156(a) (""Any individual, partnership, association, corporation, or other entity . . . that engages, has 
engaged, or proposes to engage in violations of Section 6155, shall be liable for a civil penalty . . . . ."") (emphasis supplied). 
Thus, UpCounsel's motion to dismiss plaintiffs' UCL claim based on a violation of section 6152 is DENIED. "
725,20," As for Balukjan v. Virgin Am., Inc., No. 18-cv-00185-SI, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 40387, 2018 WL 1242179 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 9, 
2018), the court there stated in dicta that ""[v]irtually any state, federal or local law can serve as the predicate for an action under 
section 17200, . . . including . . . rules of professional conduct."" 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 40387, [WL] at *7. However, the court 
engaged in no analysis on that point. Instead, it relied on Herrera, which, as the Court previously indicated, did not involve a 
private action."
725,21," In light of the Court's ruling, the Court does not address the parties' remaining arguments regarding the RPC. "
735,1," The MPs are Ahold U.S.A., Inc.; Albertson's LLC; BI—LO, LLC; CVS Pharmacy, Inc.; The Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea 
Company, Inc.; H.E. Butt Grocery Co.; Hy-Vee, Inc.; The Kroger Co.; Meijer, Inc.; Publix Super Markets, Inc.; Raley's Inc.; Rite 
Aid Corporation; Rite Aid HDQTRS Corp.; Safeway Inc.; Supervalu Inc.; and Walgreen Co. "
737,2," Visa and MasterCard entered into consent decrees with the Government on the same day that the Government Action was 
initiated; only Amex remained as a defendant. See In re Amex, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3332, 2016 WL 748089, at *2 n.5."
737,3," In response to the grant of certiorari, this court stayed all further proceedings in the MP Actions. (Oct. 24, 2017, Order.) The 
court directed the parties, by no later than 14 days after entry of a decision in Ohio, to ""confer and submit a joint letter proposing 
a schedule for additional motions, if any, and setting forth the parties' availability for trial."" (Id.) "
740,4," The Court also noted that credit-card networks are a particular kind of two-sided platform: a transaction platform, which 
""suppl[ies] only one product-transactions."" Ohio, 138 S. Ct. at 2286 (internal quotation marks omitted). ""In the credit-card market, 
these transactions are jointly consumed by a cardholder, who uses the payment card to make a transaction, and a merchant, 
who accepts the payment card as a method of payment."" Id. (internal quotation marks omitted)."
740,5," In a subsequent portion of the Ohio opinion, the Court found that the evidence does not support the Government's contention 
that Amex's anti-steering provisions are the cause of any increases in merchant fees. 138 S. Ct. at 2288. Instead, the Court "
741,," found that that the cause of increased merchant fees is ""increased competition for cardholders and a corresponding marketwide 
adjustment in the relative price charged to merchants."" Id."
741,6," This form of stare decisis is commonly referred to as ""vertical stare decisis,"" as distinguished from ""horizontal stare decisis,"" 
which refers to a court's adherence to its own past decisions. See, e.g., Joseph W. Mead, Stare Decisis in the Inferior Courts of 
the United States, 12 Nev. L.J. 787, 788 (2012); Alan M. Trammell, Precedent and Preclusion, 93 Notre Dame L. Rev. 565, 581 
(2017). "
742,7," Amex also points out that the MPs, in earlier filings in this action, admitted that ""the basic facts and law in the Government 
[Action] and the MP Actions] are identical."" (Reply at 3.)"
742,8," This court's construction of the Ohio holding does not violate the general rule that courts should not read Supreme Court 
opinions as ""contain[ing] holdings on matters the Court did not discuss and which, presumably, the parties did not argue,"" 
Sweeney v. Westvaco Co., 926 F.2d 29, 40 (1st Cir. 1991) (Breyer, C.J.). (See also Opp'n at 12.) The relevant question in this 
instance is whether the Court discussed, and issued a holding on, whether Amex is a two-sided transaction platform and 
whether the ""relevant market"" for antitrust purposes contains both sides of the platform. Because the Court did so, see Ohio, 138 
S. Ct. at 2286-87, the question of whether this holding incorporated the MPs' maturity theory is irrelevant."
742,9," In support of their argument regarding market maturity, the MPs point to US Airways, Inc. v. Sabre Holdings Corp., No. 11-CV-
2725 (LGS), 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 40932, 2017 WL 1064709 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 21, 2017), appeal filed, No. 17-983 (2d Cir. Apr. 6, 
2017). (See Opp'n at 11.) In US Airways, the district court held that the Second Circuit's opinion in U.S. v. Amex did not 
foreclose the US Airways jury's finding of a one-sided market based on market maturity, in part because U.S. v. Amex ""[did] not 
address or appear to consider market maturity."" 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 40932, 2017 WL 1064709, at *10. But US Airways noted 
that the finding of a two-sided market in U.S. v. Amex occurred ""in a different industry and with very different facts,"" id., 
suggesting that the Second Circuit's decision was binding on the facts of the Amex platform, which continue to be present in this 
case. While U.S. v. Amex and Ohio may not foreclose future antitrust plaintiffs from arguing that a supposedly two-sided market "
743,," is actually one-sided due to the presence of market maturity, US Airways makes it clear that such an argument cannot survive 
on the facts of the MP Actions."
743,10," Because vertical stare decisis is an absolute command, see Amy Coney Barrett, Precedent and Jurisprudential Disagreement, 
91 Tex. L. Rev. 1711, 1713 (2013), this court is forbidden from revisiting a higher court's binding holding, no matter how little 
sense a bound party—or this court—may think the applicable rule of law makes."
743,11," In Taylor, the Supreme Court specifically recognized the possibility that a nonparty against whom a decision would not 
necessarily have a preclusive effect could still be barred as a matter of law from litigating ""repetitive suits"" through application of 
stare decisis. See [**48]  553 U.S. at 893-95; see also Rodriguez, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 108660, 2008 WL 5978925, at *2 
(stating that litigation that involves ""the exact same set of facts"" as an earlier case would be ""effectively foreclose[d]"" as a matter 
of stare decisis). "
744,12," The cases that the MPs cite in support of their argument that the holding of Ohio cannot be given stare decisis effect are 
inapposite. (See Opp'n at 3.) In Complaint of Tug Helen B. Moran, Inc., 607 F.2d 1029 (2d Cir. 1979), the Second Circuit 
found that the apportionment of liability in one negligence case did not bind the district court's apportionment of liability in a 
subsequent case arising out of a different incident. The holding in Ohio is not a ""determination[] of fact,"" and even if it were, the 
Second Circuit's consideration of stare decisis in Tug Helen B. Moran would not apply because this case is not one in which 
there are ""different facts and a different record."" See id. at 1031. And in United States v. Nolan, 136 F.3d 265 (2d Cir. 1998), the 
Second Circuit briefly mentioned stare decisis in dicta as a way of expressing the point that the same statute can be interpreted 
in a variety of ways depending on the factual situation. See id. at 269. That anodyne point is not relevant to the motion before 
the court. "
745,13," The Supreme Court's description of these factors as ""practical indicia"" indicates that this list is not intended to function as a 
""litmus test""—""submarkets can exist where only some of these factors are present."" Bon-Ton Stores, Inc. v. May Dep't Stores 
Co., 881 F. Supp. 860, 868 (W.D.N.Y. 1994). "
747,14," The product supplied by Amex is credit-card ""transactions."" Ohio, 138 S. Ct. at 2286-87. A transaction occurs when Amex 
facilitates a cardholder's use of her card to buy a good at the same time that it facilitates a merchant's acceptance of the card to 
receive payment for the good. See id.; Benjamin Klein et al., Competition in Two-Sided Markets: The Antitrust Economics of 
Payment Card Interchange Fees, 73 Antitrust L.J. 571, 580 (2006) (""[P]ayment card transactions . . . are jointly consumed by a 
cardholder, who uses the payment card to make a transaction, and a merchant, who accepts the payment card as a method of 
payment."")."
747,15," The practical differences between Amex, which operates a ""closed-loop"" payment card system, and Visa and MasterCard, 
which operate ""open-loop"" systems, have been extensively discussed in the context of the Government Action. See U.S. v. 
Amex, 838 F.3d at 188, 207-08; U.S. v. Amex, 88 F. Supp. 3d at 157-58. "
748,16," In their original opposition to Amex's motion for summary judgment as to an Amex-only submarket, the MPs treated the terms 
""critical loss analysis"" and ""insistence"" as interchangeable. (See MPs Nov. 21, 2013, Mem. in Opp'n to Amex Mot. for Summ. J. 
(Dkt. 715) at 20, 22; see also Amex Reply at 9.)"
748,17," The MPs argue that the Second Circuit's discussion of cardholder insistence is irrelevant to the question of whether they can 
define an Amex-only relevant market because that court's opinion only discussed cardholder insistence in the context of market "
749,," power. (Opp'n at 19 & n.6.) The MPs read the Second Circuit's opinion too narrowly. As discussed above, the question of 
whether the MPs may proceed as to an Amex-only market turns on the question of whether Amex's power to force the MPs to 
agree to the NDPs stems from the market or from the contract. See Smugglers Notch, 414 F. App'x at 376-77. Accordingly, the 
Second Circuit's findings as to insistence in the context of market power are applicable here, where the definition of the relevant 
market requires analysis of market power. "
754,1," Moore is the ""President and co-founder"" of Sentinel. Harrington and Winnett are defendants in the underlying action. Harrington 
""quit as a partner of Sentinel"" in 2009, while Winnett sold his interest in 2011. Superpro, the Chinese manufacturing company, 
was not named as a defendant."
754,2," Although Sentinel's notice of appeal states it has appealed from the judgment, in its briefing Sentinel asks only that this court 
""vacate the Judgment issued in favor of Hydrofarm."" "
761,1," This motion was determined to be suitable for decision without oral argument. E.D. Cal. L.R. 230(g). The hearing was 
scheduled for January 8, 2019. The parties should also take notice that this is the only footnote in this Order. The Court finds "
762,," that 71 footnotes by Verizon and 10 footnotes by O1 is very distracting. The parties are strongly encouraged to avoid such 
excessive and unnecessary use of footnotes in the future. "

population. Friends of Lake View School District Inc. No. 25 of Phillips County v. Beebe, 578 F.3d 753, 762 n. 12 (8th Cir. 2009); 
see also Hollinger v. Home State Mut. Ins. Co., 654 F.3d 564, 571-72 (5th Cir. 2011) (""United States census data is an 
appropriate and frequent subject of judicial notice""). "
782,4," For the same reasons, even if PSP had alleged facts showing, for purposes of its Section 1 claim, that Prime and Walgreens 
were direct competitors, PSP would not be able to show that the per se standard should apply to that claim because it does not 
allege facts showing the two possessed market power. See Johnson Bros., 830 F. Supp. 2d at 707 (requiring proof of market 
power or exclusive access to an element necessary for competition for per se rule to apply to refusal to deal claim). "
783,5," The Court will take judicial notice of the Alabama Board of Pharmacy's license verification for purposes of this motion to 
dismiss. Stahl v. U.S. Dep't of Agriculture, 327 F.3d 697, 700 (8th Cir. 2003) (""The district court may take judicial notice of public 
records and thus may consider them on a motion to dismiss."") "
784,6," The Auraria court also noted that it was the ""minority position"" to not require that a relevant market be defined in a conspiracy-
to-monopolize case. 845 F.3d at 1241. The Court also noted that commentators had concluded that the ""better reasoned 
decisions"" required proof of a relevant market in such cases. 845 F.3d at 1239 n. 4. "
808,1," At times the SAC refers to Mallinckrodt when it actually meant Questcor. For example, plaintiffs allege that Mallinckrodt 
acquired the Acthar monopoly from Aventis, SAC ¶ 9, when in actuality Questcor purchased Acthar. Because the SAC alleges 
that Mallinckrodt is responsible for Questcor's actions before 2014—a proposition which neither Mallinckrodt plc nor Mallinckrodt 
ARD, Inc. contest—the court will treat Questcor's actions as Mallinckrodt's actions for purposes of these motions to dismiss. The 
court's references to Mallinckrodt before 2014 refer to Questcor's conduct. "
809,2," Express Scripts argues that the various Express Scripts entities named in this action are distinct corporate entities, and 
accordingly, plaintiffs cannot ""group plead"" their allegations against all of the Express Scripts entities because ""[a] complaint 
based on a theory of collective responsibility must be dismissed,"" even in cases of alleged conspiracy, where plaintiffs do not 
allege that each particular defendant joined the conspiracy and knew of its scope. Bank of Am., N.A. v. Knight, 725 F.3d 815, 
818 (7th Cir. 2013). But the SAC contains various allegations about the roles of each Express Script entity such that each entity 
is put on notice as to which defendants engaged in which acts that allowed Express Scripts to effectuate the alleged antitrust 
violations. See Guaranteed Rate, Inc. v. Conn, 264 F. Supp. 3d 909, 931 (N.D. Ill. 2017) (differentiating the facts in that case 
from Knight where there were no allegations about which defendant did what, whereas the allegations in Conn laid out how each 
entity played a particular role in the conspiracy). It may come about in discovery that there are insufficient facts to support claims 
against the specific Express Scripts entities. But at this stage, the court accepts plaintiffs' allegations that the Express Scripts 
entities worked together, through various lines of business, to effectuate the Synacthen Acquisition, and does not find that 
plaintiffs' group pleading provides the Express Scripts defendants insufficient notice of the claims against them."
809,3," In ¶ 48 of the SAC, plaintiffs allege that Mallinckrodt's announcement of the ""new strategy"" was ""[e]ffective August 1, 2001,"" 
when it appears that plaintiffs meant August 1, 2007."
809,4," Plaintiffs allege that Express Scripts Holding Company announced on November 27, 2017, that it sold UBC to a private equity 
firm."
809,5," Express Scripts notes in their motion to dismiss that CuraScript, Inc. is actually a specialty pharmacy, whereas the pertinent 
entity is Priority Healthcare Distribution, Inc., doing business as CuraScript SD. "
810,6," The consent order between the FTC and Mallinckrodt notes: ""This Order shall not be used as evidence in any proceedings 
other than a proceeding by Plaintiffs or the Synacthen Sublicensee regarding enforcement or modification of this Order."" Order 
for Permanent Injunction and Equitable Monetary Relief, FTC v. Mallinckrodt ARD Inc., F.T.C. No. 1310172, at 8 (D.D.C. Jan 30, 
2017). Accordingly, the court does not consider the Order for its analysis in this opinion, but does consider the FTC and 
Retrophin complaints. "
811,7," Plaintiffs also filed supplemental authority they believe support their positions; defendants filed briefs disputing that these cases 
militate in favor of plaintiffs. The court acknowledges these cases and has considered them in its analysis."
811,8," For purposes of this opinion only, references to a ""conspiracy"" in the opinion's sections on plaintiffs' federal and state antitrust 
claims refer specifically to an ""antitrust conspiracy,"" whereas references to a ""conspiracy"" in the other sections refers instead to 
common-law conspiracy, the principle difference being that the court applies Rule 9(b)'s heightened pleading standard to the 
latter but not the former. "
813,9," The court leaves open the possibility after discovery that Rockford can prove that it stands in a direct purchasing relationship 
with Mallinckrodt, depending on what the evidence uncovers about the structure of the exclusive distribution arrangement—for 
example, if plaintiffs can prove that Express Scripts is really Mallinckrodt's agent. "
815,10, Defendants do not argue that plaintiffs fail to meet the AGC factors with respect to their federal antitrust claims. 
816,11," Taking plaintiffs' allegations as true, the assertions that Acument paid CVS for Acthar appear to contradict the exclusivity of 
ESI as the only PBM as part of the alleged ASAP. Additionally, Acument's explanation of CVS' role in defendants' alleged 
scheme is cryptic. Acument alleges that it had a contract with CVS which provided prescription drug insurance coverage for its 
employee's spouse. SAC ¶ 71. But it is unclear whether CVS is acting as a prescription drug insurance carrier or something 
else. CVS is elsewhere described as an entity which performs a function similar to that of ESI. Id. ¶¶ 66, 70, 233. The SAC 
states that CVS is required to collect payments for the purchase of Acthar, but figures 1 and 2, which are presumably designed 
to clarify the text, shows that patient payments go directly from the patient to ESI. This situation is further muddled by plaintiffs' 
allegation that CVS deducts an agreed-upon share of money it receives before forwarding it to Mallinckrodt, while figures 1 and 
2 of the SAC show money from the health plans, which may or may not refer to CVS, going to ESI. See id. ¶ 233. Notably, 
Acument's role is not shown on the figures at all. Rockford is self-insured, but it is unclear how in this scenario in which 
Acument's employee's spouse has prescription insurance coverage that Acument still pays 80% of the cost of the spouse's 
specialty pharmacy drugs, which comes to $894,617.75, to obtain Acthar. Id. ¶¶ 10, 21. The dearth of information makes it 
difficult to understand the precise relationship of Acument, CVS, and the patient. Curiously, the SAC claims that payments for 
Acthar flow directly from Acument to CVS, id. ¶ 233, which is described as one of the ""co-conspirators,"" id. ¶ 234, yet no details 
are provided anywhere else in the SAC as to how CVS participates in the alleged conspiracy."
816,12," Defendants argue that the court should not exercise its discretion and allow plaintiffs to replead for a third time. The court 
notes that while another amended complaint will be plaintiffs' fourth total complaint filed in this action, a subsequent complaint 
would be the first incident to the court's ruling on a Rule 12(b) motion. As plaintiffs requested leave to amend in their oppositions 
to defendants' motions to dismiss, the court will allow plaintiffs to replead to correct the deficiencies detailed in this opinion if 
counsel can do so in accordance with the obligations imposed by Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure."
816,13," The remainder of this opinion's analysis of plaintiffs' federal antitrust claims deals only with Rockford because the court has 
found that Acument has not shown that it has antitrust standing to bring its federal antitrust claims. However, Acument may have 
viable claims should it choose to sufficiently replead antitrust standing to bring its federal antitrust claims. The court makes no 
finding at this stage as to whether Acument has adequately stated a claim. "
818,14," Section 2 claims may be plead under three different theories: (1) monopolization, (2) attempted monopolization, and (3) 
conspiracy to monopolize. Plaintiffs proceed under the third theory only. "
819,15," HN22[
] Plaintiffs also seek injunctive relief under § 16 of the Clayton Act, SAC ¶ 12, which provides in part that ""[a]ny person, firm, corporation, or association shall be entitled to sue for and have injunctive relief . . . against threatened loss or "
820,," damage by a violation of the antitrust laws."" 15 U.S.C. § 26. Aside from very brief and passing references in the SAC, see id. ¶¶ 
12, 254, and their prayers for relief, plaintiffs only raise the issue of injunctive relief pursuant to its federal antitrust claims in its 
briefing opposing the motion to dismiss. HN23[
] Defendants do not dispute plaintiffs' claims for injunctive relief separate from their arguments opposing plaintiffs' §§ 1 and 2 claims. Plaintiffs are correct to point out that Illinois Brick does not foreclose plaintiffs' equitable relief claims. See In re Broiler Chicken 
Antitrust Litig., 290 F. Supp. 3d 772, 813 (N.D. Ill. 2017) (quoting U.S. Gypsum Co. v. Ind. Gas Co., Inc., 350 F.3d 623, 627 (7th 
Cir. 2003). (""[T]he [in]direct-purchaser doctrine does not foreclose equitable relief.""); Cargill, Inc. v. Monfort of Colo., Inc., 479 
U.S. 104, 111 n.6, 107 S. Ct. 484, 93 L. Ed. 2d 427 (1986) (explaining that Clayton Act claims under § 16 do not implicate Illinois 
Brick because ""standing under § 16 raises no threat of multiple lawsuits or duplicative recoveries""). And while plaintiffs' 
allegations concerning injunctive relief under § 16 of the Clayton Act must also allege antitrust standing in line with AGC, see 
Teamsters, 196 F.3d at 823, because the court has determined that Rockford satisfied the AGC factors with respect to its §§ 1 
and 2 claims, the court finds that Rockford also has antitrust standing to sue defendants for injunctive relief under § 16. The 
court defers on ruling on Acument's antitrust standing under AGC until Acument repleads, if it chooses to do so."
820,16," In California v. ARC Am. Corp., 490 U.S. 93, 109 S. Ct. 1661, 104 L. Ed. 2d 86 (1989), the Supreme Court held that state 
legislatures could pass laws ""repealing"" Illinois Brick (known as ""Illinois Brick repealer statutes""), thus allowing for indirect 
plaintiffs to sue upstream antitrust defendants. Some of the states implicated in the SAC passed these statutes with the explicit 
intention of repealing Illinois Brick as applied to those respective states; other states passed antitrust or consumer protection 
statutes that effectually allow for such suits. Here, defendants put forth no argument that Illinois Brick works to prevent any 
indirect-purchaser suits in these states."
820,17," The parties agree that Rockford and Acument have Article III standing to pursue state-law antitrust and consumer protection 
claims of Illinois and Tennessee, respectively. "
821,18," The parties put forth no argument that AGC is irrelevant to state-law consumer protection claims. For purposes of this order 
only, the court considers all of the state laws invoked by the SAC as state laws that implicate plaintiffs' antitrust standing. "
822,19," Without any analysis or citation to authority by any of the parties, the court notes in passing its strong skepticism that any state 
that passed an ""Illinois Brick repealer"" statute to make indirect-purchaser standing easier would have made that indirect-
purchaser's antitrust standing harder under a ""proximate cause"" analysis. Thus, the court assumes that the federal AGC 
standard represents the most stringent ""proper party"" standard that could apply to a state's ""proximate cause"" analysis for a 
plaintiff's antitrust standing. See Lithium, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 141358, 2014 WL 4955377, at *11 & n.13."
822,20," The court couches the language in this section as applying to both Rockford and Acument, but it is relevant to Acument only if 
it chooses to replead. "
823,21," The parties' arguments concerning these requirements are styled as arguments about whether plaintiffs have plausibly ""stated 
a claim"" with respect to each states' antitrust laws. Cf. Broiler Chicken, 290 F. Supp. 3d at 816 (discussing threshold issues 
concerning state antitrust laws on a motion to dismiss in terms of whether ""Plaintiffs have failed to state claims""). But the court 
does not take the parties' arguments on these points to be on the ""merits""; neither party engages the elements of any states' 
antitrust laws or whether the SAC contains allegations that sufficiently plead what is required for such elements. Rather, the 
court will address these arguments as pertaining to the threshold requirements for plaintiffs to bring claims under each specific 
state. See Dairy Farmers, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 84152, 2015 WL 3988488, at *33 (""[B]ecause Defendants do not allege that 
Indirect Plaintiffs failed to state a claim under the Arkansas, California, and Florida consumer-protection statutes (or at least 
Defendants failed to provide the relevant legal standards under those states' laws), the Court will not address such arguments."")."
823,22," For Kansas and Oregon, defendants offer no state-specific limitations. "
826,23," As noted earlier in this opinion, plaintiffs make only scant references to their requests for injunctive relief. Relatedly, the court 
does not construe the SAC to be making any claims for injunctive relief pursuant to any of the state-law antitrust and consumer 
protection statutes invoked in the SAC."
826,24," Rockford uses the names Express Scripts and ESI interchangeably in Counts XII through XV. Recognizing that ESI is the only 
defendant signatory to the PBM Agreement, the court will use the name Express Scripts to include ESI. "
827,25," Section 2.4(a) of the PBM Agreement reads: Formulary Adherence and Clinical Programs. ESI may provide clinical, safety, adherence, and other like programs as 
appropriate. The Clinical Addendum described in Exhibit A-2 sets forth certain available adherence, clinical, safety and/or 
trend programs that require additional fees hereunder. ESI will not implement any program for which Sponsor may incur an 
additional fee without Sponsor's prior written approval and election of such program."
827,26," Even McMahon, on which Express Scripts relies, was not decided on a motion to dismiss."
827,27," Further, Section III(c) of Exhibit A-1of the PBM Agreement notes that ""Specialty Products will be excluded from any price 
guarantees set forth in the agreement,"" and Acthar is listed as a Specialty Product. Should Rockford choose to replead, the court "
828,," expects Rockford to clarify that this Section does not operate to preclude its breach of contract claim in the event that Rockford 
can plausibly allege that ""cost containment"" is an actionable obligation contained within the PBM Agreement."
828,28," Along these same lines, in order to conserve time and effort, the court wishes to draw the parties attention to two other thorny 
issues in the breach of contract claim. The SAC charges that ""ESI's failure to provide 'cost containment' repudiated its 
obligations under the ESI PBM Agreement."" SAC ¶ 391 (emphasis added). Yet § 2.4(a) of the Agreement states only that ""ESI 
may provide clinical, safety, adherence, and other like programs as appropriate."" (emphasis added). Also, it is important to 
remember that the PBM Agreement applies to numerous other drugs besides Acthar. If Express Scripts engages in cost 
containment programs (whatever they may be) related to drugs other than Acthar, the question arises whether such involvement 
with other drugs would satisfy any ""cost containment"" obligation Express Scripts has under the PBM Agreement. At this point the 
court takes no position as to the parameters of Express Scripts' duties under the Agreement, but these are matters which should 
be addressed as soon as possible. "
829,29," Section 2.4(a) of the PBM Agreement notes that Express Scripts ""may provide clinical, safety, adherence, and other like 
programs as appropriate."" The Recitals section of the PBM Agreement suggests that these are the kinds of things that Express 
Scripts does. If Rockford can plausibly allege that these (or different) sections of the PBM Agreement imparts discretion upon 
Express Scripts, and such discretion specifically includes ""cost containment,"" Rockford may be able to state a claim under the 
implied covenant theory. Of course, an unenforceable provision in a contract cannot be made enforceable by the application of 
the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. As a result, Rockford still faces some of the obstacles noted in the previous 
breach of contract section related to the enforceability of the cost containment provisions of the PBM Agreement. "
832,30," The court notes in passing that plaintiffs' arguments offer little in support of their unjust enrichment actions. Should plaintiffs 
choose to replead these claims, plaintiffs should offer more fully-developed arguments or else run the risk of the court finding 
that they have abandoned their claims."
832,31," The SAC labels its wire fraud claims as under 18 U.S.C. § ""1345."" However, that section provides for the Attorney General to 
commence civil actions to enjoin alleged RICO violations. This is inapplicable to plaintiffs' "
833,32," In all of the counts of the SAC, plaintiffs incorporate every allegation of every preceding paragraph, and in Counts XIII and 
XIV, every allegation of every following paragraph. In the RICO context, this is an improper method of satisfying the heightened 
pleading requirement. See Slaney v. The Int'l Amateur Athletic Fed'n, 244 F.3d 580, 599 n.10 (7th Cir. 2001). But even beyond 
the RICO counts, the court does not assume any responsibility to wade through hundreds of paragraphs of pleadings comprising 
fifteen counts plus a request for injunctive to cull out paragraphs or fragments of paragraphs in an effort to assist plaintiffs in 
plausibly alleging their causes of action. This court has dismissed cases in certain circumstances on this basis, though the court 
declines to do so today. See Stanard v. Nygren, 658 F.3d 792, 800 (7th Cir. 2011) (""A federal court is not obligated to sift 
through a complaint to extract some merit when the attorney who drafted it has failed to do so himself.""). "
835,33," In ¶ 203 of the SAC, plaintiffs also allege that defendants' acts ""violate the common law against negligent misrepresentation"" 
in addition to fraud. ""Negligent misrepresentation"" is a separate cause of action from fraud in both Illinois and Tennessee. 
However, neither party addresses this claim in their briefs. Thus, the court concludes that neither plaintiff is pursuing a cause of 
action for negligent misrepresentation."
835,34," As to Acument, the SAC suggests that Acument has ""contracts"" with CVS that provide for cost containment, SAC ¶ 209, that 
presumably support their contention that defendants made false representations that amount to fraud. Although it is unclear 
whether Acument is holding Express Scripts, Mallinckrodt, or perhaps a non-defendant, CVS, responsible for making the false 
representations. Plaintiffs have not provided any of these contracts and thus the court is unable to make any determination as to 
whether plaintiffs' allegations satisfy the heightened pleading requirements of Rule 9(b)."
835,35," Defendants also argue that plaintiffs have not adequately pled reliance. Plaintiffs allege that they and the class ""justifiably 
relied upon false misrepresentations in purchasing and/or reimbursing Acthar at the amount charged by Express Scripts and 
CVS Caremark based on the price set by Mallinckrodt."" SAC ¶ 208. But in this factual scenario that concerns only one 
manufacturer and one drug, the issue of the reasonableness of plaintiffs' reliance is problematic. Plaintiffs assert that they would 
not have paid or reimbursed the cost of Acthar if they were aware of the alleged misrepresentations. Id. ¶ 210. Are plaintiffs "
836,," saying that rather than pay exorbitant prices they would have left the Acthar patients without treatment? Regardless, at this 
juncture the court concludes that reliance is sufficiently pled. "
841,1," For the purposes of this motion to dismiss, the Court accepts as true all of Plaintiffs' well-pleaded factual allegations and draws 
all reasonable inferences in Plaintiffs' favor. Killingsworth v. HSBC Bank Nev., N.A., 507 F.3d 614, 618 (7th Cir. 2007)."
841,2," Unless otherwise noted, all references to the complaint are to the complaint filed in Case No. 18-cv-1058. [Cox Automotive, Inc, 
et al. v. CDK Global, LLC, Case No. 18-cv-1058, Dkt. 1 (N.D. Ill.).] "
845,3," Defendant argues that Plaintiffs concede a number of points demonstrating that Defendant and Reynolds engaged in nothing 
more than permissible parallel conduct. [72, at 14.] For example, Defendant argues that the fact that Reynolds's decision to 
close its DMS preceded Defendant's decision to do the same by several years demonstrates that there was no illicit agreement 
between Reynolds and Defendant. [Id.] However, nothing prevented Reynolds from deciding to open its DMS. Indeed, given that 
Plaintiffs allege that Reynolds lost business to Defendant as a result of its closed DMS, Reynolds had the incentive to do so. 
While Defendant is free to argue that the purported concessions demonstrate that Defendant and Reynolds merely engaged in 
parallel conduct, the Court cannot ignore the well-plead allegations establishing a horizontal agreement and must draw all 
reasonable inferences in Plaintiffs' favor on a motion to dismiss. Killingsworth, 507 F.3d at 618. "
846,4," CDK also argues that Plaintiffs' market-division claim fails because Plaintiffs do not allege a market-division agreement ""among 
competitors at the same market level[.]"" [72, at 15-16 (quoting Cal. ex rel. Harris v. Safeway, Inc., 651 F.3d 1118, 1137 (9th Cir. 
2011).] However, Defendant does not identify what is necessary to make such a showing. Here, Plaintiffs allege that Reynolds 
and CDK were both competitors in the data integration market. [See, e.g., Compl., at ¶ 2.] Plaintiffs further allege that Defendant 
and Reynolds each provide data integration services for their respective DMSs. Without an explanation by Defendants as to why 
these allegations are insufficient, the Court declines to address this undeveloped argument at this time. "
847,5," In the Authenticom decision, Judge St. Eve described the data-integration market and the DMS market as separate markets 
based on similar allegations. In re Dealer Mgmt. Sys. Antitrust Litig., 313 F. Supp. 3d at 940. The Court sees no reason to 
change course based on Defendant's current arguments, especially given that Plaintiffs have alleged that Defendant itself treats 
its data-integration services as a separate product from its DMS. [See, e.g., Compl., at ¶ 67 (""In its 2015 10-K, CDK described its 
data integration services as 'a stand-alone product' separate from 'the core Dealer Management System.'"" (citation omitted)).] "
848,6," In its opening brief, Defendant merely asserts that ""it is doubtful that [Plaintiffs] have standing"" to challenge the exclusion of 
data integrators. [72, at 21.] Defendant does not, however, affirmatively argue the point. Instead, Defendant asserts that an 
exclusive dealing claim based on the foreclosure of hostile integrators would fail because hostile integrators still were able to 
deal with DMS providers covering a sizeable portion of the market for car dealership DMS services. [Id.] Still, Defendant does 
not provide any authority or factual support for that assertion. "
849,7," When the Seventh Circuit reviewed the preliminary injunction entered in the Authenticom case, the Seventh Circuit indicated 
that it was ""dubious in the extreme"" that the alleged conduct of Defendant and Reynolds ""amounts to tying, rather than simply 
participation at two levels of the market[.]"" Authenticom, Inc. v. CDK Glob., LLC, 874 F.3d 1019, 1026 (7th Cir. 2017). For the 
reasons discussed above, the Court reaches the same conclusion with respect to the allegations currently before the Court."
849,8," As noted by Plaintiffs [126, at 20-21], Defendant does not appear to be arguing that Plaintiffs have failed to allege an actual 
adverse effect on competition in the identified market. "
850,9," The Supreme Court has recognized that whether a justification is a pretext can be evaluated under the rule of reason analysis. 
Nw. Wholesale Stationers, Inc., 472 U.S. at 297. "
851,10," The Court notes that the complaint indicates that Defendant later revoked any authorization. Still, according to the allegations 
in the complaint, dealers already using Defendant's DMS were effectively locked in their purchase. [Compl., at ¶¶ 56-60, 207.]"
851,11," Although Plaintiffs did not make this argument, the Court also notes that ""a plaintiff's wrongdoing is not a defense to an 
antitrust suit."" In re Dealer Mgmt. Sys. Antitrust Litig., 313 F. Supp. 3d at 946. "
852,12," The parties' agreement on this issue is supported by case law, as there is ""no antitrust duty to deal * * * in selling services to [ ] 
competitors in the retail market."" In re Dealer Mgmt. Sys. Antitrust Litig., 313 F. Supp. 3d at 955 (citing Pac. Bell Tel. Co. v. 
Linkline Commc'ns, Inc., 555 U.S. 438, 450, 129 S. Ct. 1109, 172 L. Ed. 2d 836 (2009)); see also Schor, 457 F.3d at 610 
(""[A]ntitrust law does not require monopolists to cooperate with rivals by selling them products that would help the rivals to 
compete. Cooperation is a problem in antitrust, not one of its obligations."" (internal citation omitted)); Authenticom, Inc. v. CDK 
Global, LLC, 874 F.3d 1019, 1025 (7th Cir. 2017) (""Even monopolists are almost never required to assist their competitors[.]"" 
(citation omitted))."
852,13," Defendant notes that Glaberson and another case cited by Plaintiffs do not address Section 2 claims. However, Plaintiffs cite 
these cases for the proposition that Trinko is limited to refusal-to-deal claims and does not insulate a defendant who engages in 
other misconduct from liability."
852,14," To the extent that Plaintiffs' Section 2 claim rests on allegations of a horizonal conspiracy, Defendant contends Plaintiffs are 
limited to bringing a Section 1 claim. But Defendant does not cite to any authority holding that violations of Section 1 are 
insufficient to establish anticompetitive conduct for the purposes of Section 2. As noted above, the case law supports the 
contrary position."
852,15," Plaintiffs also argue that they have stated a claim under the ""unfair prong"" of the California UCL. [126, at 28.] Plaintiffs do not, 
however, identify what conduct it contends satisfies the ""unfair prong"" of the California UCL. Because Plaintiffs sufficiently have 
alleged violations of the Sherman Act, however, Plaintiffs' California UCL claim survives. "
871,1," For the purposes of this motion to dismiss, the Court accepts as true all of Plaintiffs' well-pleaded factual allegations and draws 
all reasonable inferences in Plaintiffs' favor. Killingsworth v. HSBC Bank Nev., N.A., 507 F.3d 614, 618 (7th Cir. 2007). "
875,2," ""Order"" is defined as ""the Master Agreement and/or an Exhibit that has been accepted by [Reynolds]."" [255-10, at 3.]"
875,3," Because Reynolds withdrew its motion, all references to Defendant below are to Defendant CDK. "
877,4," Although CDK adopts the arguments advanced by Reynolds in support of the application of the arbitration agreement, 
Reynolds did not need to address whether the threshold issue of arbitrability applies to nonsignatories, as Reynolds was a 
signatory. And CDK's own briefs do not address the issue."
877,5," CDK argues that Warciak is distinguishable because it involved the application of Illinois law. HN8[
] However, in Warciak, the 
Seventh Circuit cited to the Supreme Court's decision in Arthur Andersen LLP v. Carlisle, 556 U.S. 624, 129 S. Ct. 1896, 173 L. 
Ed. 2d 832 (2009), for the proposition that traditional state-law principles such as assumption, agency, and estoppel apply to 
determining when a contract such as an agreement to arbitrate can be enforced against nonparties. Warciak, 880 F.3d at 872. "
878,," Thus, pursuant to Arthur Anderson and Warciak, the Court looks to Ohio's traditional equitable estoppel principles to determine 
when an arbitration agreement can be enforced against a nonsignatory under Ohio law."
878,6," CDK notes that Plaintiffs fail to address the cases they cited to in their opening brief in which courts held that allegations of a 
conspiracy or joint venture between signatory and non-signatory defendants, including in the antitrust context, were sufficient to 
equitably estop the signatory plaintiff to arbitrate claims against the non-signatory defendant. [266, at 25 n.5.] However, none of 
those cases purported to apply Ohio law. Furthermore, all of those cases were decided before the Supreme Court made clear 
that state law governs who is bound by agreements to arbitrate. Arthur Andersen LLP, 556 U.S. at 630."
878,7," The only Ohio case cited by the court in I Sports was Gerig v. Kahn, which held that a signatory to a contract may enforce an 
arbitration provision against a nonsignatory seeking a declaration of the signatories' rights and obligations under the contract. 95 
Ohio St. 3d 478, 2002- Ohio 2581, 769 N.E.2d 381, 385-86 (Ohio 2002). However, the Ohio Supreme Court later limited Gerig to 
situations ""when a nonparty is 'seeking a declaration of the signatories' rights and obligations under the contract."" Henderson v. 
Lawyers Title Ins. Corp., 108 Ohio St. 3d 265, 2006- Ohio 906, 843 N.E.2d 152, 161 (Ohio 2006). "
879,8," To be sure, the Court is not saying that Defendant's participation in discovery alone is the basis for finding waiver. Defendant 
could have participated in discovery while reserving its right to arbitrate. Given the simplicity of Defendant's arbitration argument 
(i.e., Plaintiffs must arbitrate all claims relating to their contract with Reynolds), however, it does not appear as though 
Defendant's delay was necessary for Defendant to be able to determine which of Plaintiffs' claims are or are not arbitratable. 
Thus, Defendant's participation in discovery without any reservation of its right to arbitrate until July 2018 was inconsistent with 
the intent to arbitrate. "
880,9," Defendant also argues that the Plaintiffs' argument that the alleged conspiracy deprived the DMS market of a ""primary point of 
differentiation"" between CDK and Reynolds fails because the 2015 Agreements do not prohibit either party from allowing hostile 
integration at any time. [266, at 29.] As discussed below, however, the Court would have to ignore the Plaintiffs' well-pleaded 
allegations to accept that argument. "
882,10," Because the Court was applying the AGC factors to claims for damages and for injunctive relief, the Court addressed all 
relevant AGC factors. HN15[
] However, as recognized by the Court, ""[w]hen injunctive relief alone is at issue, some factors—
namely the speculative nature of the damages and the risk of duplicate recoveries or complex damages apportionment—do not 
apply to the antitrust standing analysis."" DFA I, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 119962, 2013 WL 4506000, at *9 (citation omitted). This is 
consistent with Cargill, Inc. v. Monfort of Colorado, Inc., 479 U.S. 104, 107 S. Ct. 484, 93 L. Ed. 2d 427 (1986), in which the 
Supreme Court recognized that courts should protect against multiple lawsuits for damages and duplicative recoveries by 
examining factors such as ""the potential for duplicative recovery, the complexity of apportioning damages, and the existence of 
other parties that have been more directly harmed, to determine whether a party is a proper plaintiff under § 4."" Id. at 111 n.6. 
Because claims for injunctive relief do not present a risk of multiple lawsuits for damages and duplicative recoveries, the 
Supreme Court indicated that those factors are not relevant to the antitrust standing analysis for claims seeking injunctive relief. 
Id. ""[T]he fact is that one injunction is as effective as 100, and, concomitantly, that 100 injunctions are no more effective than 
one."" Id. (quoting Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co. of Cal., 405 U.S. 251, 261, 92 S. Ct. 885, 31 L. Ed. 2d 184 (1972) (internal 
quotation marks omitted)). "
884,11," Defendant argues that such a motive is not plausible because it would not risk treble-damages liability in exchange for 
Reynolds's mere agreement to continue doing what it already had done for years. [266, at 34.] Defendant also argues that 
Plaintiffs concede a number of points demonstrating that Defendant and Reynolds engaged in nothing more than permissible 
parallel conduct. [Id.] For example, Defendant argues that the fact that Reynolds's decision to close its DMS preceded 
Defendant's decision to do the same by several years demonstrates that there was no illicit agreement between CDK and 
Reynolds. [Id.] However, nothing prevented Reynolds from deciding to open its DMS. Indeed, given that Plaintiffs allege that 
Reynolds lost business to Defendant as a result of its closed DMS, Reynolds had the incentive to do so. While Defendant is free 
later to argue that the purported concessions demonstrate that Defendant and Reynolds merely engaged in parallel conduct, the 
Court cannot ignore the well-pled allegations of a horizontal agreement and must draw all reasonable inferences in Plaintiffs' 
favor on a motion to dismiss. Killingsworth, 507 F.3d at 618. "
885,12," In the Authenticom decision, Judge St. Eve described the data-integration market and the DMS market as separate markets 
based on similar allegations. In re Dealer Mgmt. Sys. Antitrust Litig., 313 F. Supp. 3d at 940. The Court sees no reason to 
change course based on the cursory argument raised by Defendant now. "
886,13," Defendant also argues that Plaintiffs' claim under Illinois law should be dismissed because the Illinois Antitrust Act provides 
that only the Illinois Attorney General may bring a class action asserting indirect purchaser claims. See 740 Ill. Comp. Stat. 
10/7(2). Because Illinois otherwise allows indirect purchaser claims, see id., the Court views the limit on class actions to be a 
kind of class action bar, which the Court addresses below. "
887,14," Indeed, Plaintiffs do not even respond to Defendant's Illinois Brick argument under South Carolina law, implicitly conceding its 
merit of the argument. "
888,15," Plaintiffs argue that the Court's analysis regarding North Carolina law in DFA II is incorrect, citing to a North Carolina appellate 
court decision that declined to apply AGC where the product at issue was a component of the product purchased by indirect 
purchasers. [358, at 97 n.79 (citing Teague v. Bayer AG, 195 N.C. App. 18, 671 S.E.2d 550 (N.C. Ct. App. 2009)).] However, in 
DFA II, the Court acknowledged Teague, but found a lower-court decision—Crouch v. Crompton Corp., 2004 NCBC LEXIS 6, 
2004 WL 2414027 (N.C. Super. Oct. 28, 2004)—to be more well-reasoned and a better reflection of that the North Carolina 
Supreme Court would do when given the opportunity to address the issue. DFA II, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 84152, 2015 WL 
3988488, at *15. In Crouch, the court applied ""a modified version of the AGC test to determine antitrust standing that retains the 
proximate-cause inquiry inherent in AGC while still respecting Illinois Brick's ban on indirect-purchaser actions."" Id. (summarizing 
Crouch, 2004 NCBC LEXIS 6, 2004 WL 2414027). The parties do not address whether Plaintiffs' claim under North Carolina 
satisfied the modified AGC test applied in Crouch. Given that the Court finds that Plaintiffs satisfy the more stringent federal 
AGC standard, as discussed below, Plaintiffs also would satisfy the modified AGC test applied in Crouch."
888,16," HN28[
] In deciding whether to apply AGC to state-law antitrust claims, the Court looks to whether the relevant state 
supreme court or state legislature has spoken to the issue. See Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 78, 58 S. Ct. 817, 82 L. 
Ed. 1188 (1938); Jean v. Dugan, 20 F.3d 255, 260 (7th Cir.1994). ""In the absence of guiding decisions by the state's highest 
court, [federal courts] consult and follow the decisions of intermediate [state] appellate courts unless there is a convincing reason 
to predict [that] the state's highest court would disagree."" ADT Sec. Servs., Inc. v. Lisle-Woodridge Fire Prot. Dist., 672 F.3d 492, 
498 (7th Cir. 2012). "
889,17," HN30[
] The Court notes that Iowa courts have interpreted the state's harmonization provision narrowly. Comes v. Microsoft Corp., 646 N.W.2d 440, 446 (Iowa 2002) (noting that the purpose of Iowa's antitrust harmonization statute was to ""achieve 
uniform application of the state and federal laws prohibiting monopolistic practices,"" not to define who can sue under antitrust 
law). Given that the Iowa Supreme Court has applied AGC, however, this narrow interpretation has no impact on the Court's 
analysis. "
893,18," Defendant also cites to cases across the country finding that AGC or similar causation standards barred consumer litigation 
against Visa and Mastercard, who allegedly required merchants using their credit cards to accept their debit cards as well. In 
those cases, however, the plaintiffs did not allege that they overpaid for goods or services either directly or indirectly from 
Defendant. Rather, the plaintiffs claimed that merchants increased the prices of all goods sold (goods not related in any way to 
defendants) to account for the increased fees charges for debit services. They did not allege that they overpaid for purchases of 
debit processing services, either directly or indirectly. See, e.g., Kanne v. Visa U.S.A. Inc., 272 Neb. 489, 723 N.W.2d 293, 299 
(Neb. 2006) (""Appellants do not and cannot allege that they overpaid for purchases of debit processing services from 
merchants.""); Nass-Romero v. Visa U.S.A. Inc., 2012- NMCA 058, 279 P.3d 772, 778 (N.M. Ct. App. 2012) (""Plaintiff is neither a 
consumer nor a competitor in the market allegedly being restrained by Defendants and does not appear in that chain of 
distribution; thus, she cannot be identified as a consumer of the service provided by Visa and MasterCard. Plaintiff, instead, is a 
consumer of goods sold by merchants who happen to be part of the affected market.""). Here, on the other hand, Plaintiffs are 
indirect purchasers of DIS. "
894,19," Plaintiffs do not argue that being incorporated in Delaware is sufficient to establish conduct occurring in Delaware for the 
purposes of the Delaware Consumer Fraud Act. Nor do Plaintiffs cite to any cases indicating that such a showing is sufficient."
894,20," In support of its claim under Delaware law, Plaintiffs also cite to an allegation that Defendant ""violated the Delaware Consumer 
Fraud Act, 6 Del. Code § 2511, et seq., through their unfair and/or deceptive practices."" [198 (Compl.), at ¶ 578.] However, that 
allegation does not identify any conduct occurring in Delaware. "
896,21," Despite the lack of Tennessee authority on point, the Court would have appreciated a fulsome explanation as to why software 
should or should not be considered a tangible good under the TTPA. Although the Court would have entertained any such 
argument on a motion for summary judgment, the Court already is dismissing Plaintiffs TTPA claim for failure to allege sufficient 
intrastate conduct. The issue therefore is moot. "
897,22," Defendant's memorandum in support of its motion to dismiss does cite to one district court case from California for the 
proposition that West Virginia's consumer protection statute does not cover antitrust violations. [266, at 57 (citing See In re 
Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) Antitrust Litig., 516 F. Supp. 2d 1072, 1118 (N.D. Cal. 2007)).] However, that case 
was decided before the 2015 amendment to the WVCCPA. For that reason and for the reasons discussed above, the Court finds 
the reasoning in In re Packed Seafood to be more persuasive. "
898,23," Because the Court would reach the same conclusion under the standards set forth in the plurality and in the concurrence, the 
Court need not address which standard applies. "
899,24," Defendant has withdrawn its argument that notice is required to bring a claim under Alaska's consumer protection statute. 
[378, at 28 n.11.]"
899,25," Defendant does cite to one case which held that the state notice requirements applied because there was no conflict with Rule 
23, but only did so in its reply brief. [378, at 28 (citing In re Asacol Antitrust Litig., 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 94605, 2016 WL 
4083333, at *14-15 (D. Mass. July 20, 2016).] Plaintiffs do not address the issue at all, but cannot be faulted for not doing so, as 
Defendant did not raise the issue in its opening brief. "
903,**, The panel unanimously concludes this case is suitable for decision without oral argument. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2). 
904,***," The Honorable Lynn S. Adelman, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, sitting by designation. "
905,*, This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3. 
913,*," This theory is suggested by language in the amended complaint (see, e.g., Dkt. No. 50 at ¶¶ 36, 126). At oral argument in 
December 2018, the district judge asked Dreamstime whether or not this was its theory. Dreamstime dodged the question at the 
time (Dkt. No. 65 at 4) (""Well, we think we should have been a stronger competitor in the image market, not taking Google head 
on in the search market""), but later affirmatively disavowed the theory: ""plaintiff Dreamstime is not alleging it is a future potential 
or actual direct competitor to defendant Google (or Yahoo! or Bing) in the online search advertising market"" (Dkt. No. 68 at 1). "
957,1," The putative Rule 23(b)(3) class sought relief in the form of monetary damages, and brought the action along with a separate 
class that sought equitable relief. (See First Consolidated Am. Class Action Compl. 1, Docket Entry No. 317.) At the earliest 
stages of this litigation, multiple class actions, as well as individual lawsuits by large retailers, were filed against the Defendants. 
All actions were consolidated together into a multi-district litigation in 2005 (the ""MDL""). See In re Payment Card Interchange 
Fee & Merch. Disc. Antitrust Litig., 986 F. Supp. 2d 207, 220 n.12 (E.D.N.Y. 2013) (""Interchange Fees I""). Since the initial "
958,," consolidation, a number of matters have been continuously added to the MDL, which now involves over seventy associated 
cases."
958,2," In general, in a credit card transaction, a ""merchant receives the purchase price minus two fees: the 'interchange fee' that the 
issuing bank charge[s] the acquiring bank and the 'merchant discount fee' that the acquiring bank charge[s] the merchant."" 
Interchange Fees II, 827 F.3d at 228. As previously summarized by the Second Circuit, Plaintiffs challenged several credit card 
network rules as anticompetitive: The ""default interchange"" fee applies to every transaction on the network (unless the merchant and issuing bank have 
entered into a separate agreement). The ""honor-all-cards"" rule requires merchants to accept all Visa or MasterCard credit 
cards if they accept any of them, regardless of the differences [**97]  in interchange fees. Multiple rules prohibit merchants 
from influencing customers to use one type of payment over another, such as cash rather than credit, or a credit card with a 
lower interchange fee. These ""anti-steering"" rules include the ""no-surcharge"" and ""no-discount"" rules, which prohibit 
merchants from charging different prices at the point of sale depending on the means of payment. Id. at 228-29. ""Plaintiffs allege[d] that these [anticompetitive] rules were adopted pursuant to unlawful agreements among the 
banks and Visa [and MasterCard],"" and ""that the banks owned and effectively operated Visa and MasterCard, such that Visa 
and MasterCard were unlawful 'structural conspiracies' or 'walking conspiracies' with respect to their network rules and 
practices."" Interchange Fees I, 986 F. Supp. 2d at 220−21. For a further explanation of credit card transactions and interchange 
fees, see id. at 214−15. As discussed infra, some of these challenged rules have been altered as a result of changes in the 
credit card industry, and some have been altered as a result of a prior settlement in this action."
958,3," Following remand, the two putative classes — the Rule 23(b)(2) injunctive class, and the Rule 23(b)(3) damages class — have 
been proceeding separately, and are each represented by separate counsel. (See Mem. and Order dated Nov. 30, 2016 
(""Interim Class Counsel Order""), Docket Entry No. 6754.)"
958,4," (See Mem. in Supp. of Rule 23(b)(3) Class Pls. Mot. for Class Settlement Prelim. Approval (""Mem. in Supp. of Prelim. 
Approval""), Docket Entry No. 7257-1; Superseding and Am. Definitive Class Settlement Agreement of the Rule 23(b)(3) Class

(""Green Decl.""), Docket Entry No. 7257-4; Decl. of the Hon. Edward A. Infante (Ret.) (""Infante Decl.""), Docket Entry No. 7257-5.) "
960,5," Under Rule 23, members of a class certified under Rule 23(b)(3) are afforded ""opt-out"" rights, or the right to exclude 
themselves from the class. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(2)(B)(v). No such rights are afforded under Rule 23 to classes certified under 
Rule 23(b)(2). "
961,6," To assist with his determination, Judge Gleeson appointed an economic and legal expert, Dr. Alan O. Sykes of New York 
University School of Law, to aid the court in weighing the settlement agreement and accompanying expert reports because ""[t]he 
proponents of the settlement disagree[d] strongly with the objectors over the economic value of the proposed settlement to the 
class members, and specifically over the benefits of the proposed rules changes to the merchant class."" See Interchange Fees I, 
986 F. Supp. 2d at 218. Dr. Sykes filed his written analysis with the court on August 28, 2013. (Report from Court Appointed 
Expert Professor Alan O. Sykes (""Sykes Report""), Docket Entry No. 5965.)"
961,7," The reforms included, among other things, ""Visa and MasterCard rule modifications to permit merchants to surcharge on Visa-
or MasterCard-branded credit card transactions at both the brand and product levels""; ""[a]n obligation on the part of Visa and 
MasterCard to negotiate interchange fees in good faith with merchant buying groups""; ""[a]uthorization for merchants that operate 
multiple businesses under different 'trade names' or 'banners' to accept Visa and/or MasterCard at fewer than all of its 
businesses""; and ""[t]he locking-in of the reforms in the Durbin Amendment [of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and 
Consumer Protection Act of 2010] and the DOJ [United States Department of Justice] consent decree with Visa and 
MasterCard, even if those reforms are repealed or otherwise undone."" Interchange Fees I, 986 F. Supp. 2d at 217. The Durbin 
Amendment ""limited the interchange fee that issuing banks could charge for debit card purchases, and allowed merchants to 
discount debit card purchases relative to credit card purchases."" Interchange Fees II, 827 F.3d at 229. In the DOJ consent 
decree, ""after an investigation assisted by the information developed by the [P]laintiffs,"" and following lawsuits that the 
Department of Justice initiated against Visa, Mastercard, and American Express in 2010, Interchange Fees I, 986 F. Supp. 2d at 
215, ""Visa and MasterCard agreed to remove their rules prohibiting merchants from product-level discounting of credit and debit 
cards,"" id.; see also Interchange Fees II, 827 F.3d at 229 (""pursuant to a consent decree with the Department of Justice in 2011, 
Visa and Mastercard agreed to permit merchants to discount transactions to steer consumers away from credit cards use. None 
of these developments affected the honor-all-cards or no-surcharging rules, or the existence of a default interchange fee."")."
961,8," In particular, the Second Circuit found that unitary representation of the classes violated Rule 23(a)(4) — the class certification 
requirement that representative parties adequately protect the interests of the class — and the Due Process Clause, which 
requires that named plaintiffs in a class action adequately protect the interests of absent class members. Id. at 228, 231 
(citations omitted). "
962,9," The Court notes that the landscape of state no-surcharging laws is changing. For example, in 2017, the Supreme Court held 
that a New York state statute that prohibited merchants from imposing a surcharge on customers using credit cards regulated 
speech, and remanded the matter to the Second Circuit to determine whether such speech regulation violates the First 
Amendment. See Expressions Hair Design v. Schneiderman, --- U.S. ---, 137 S. Ct. 1144, 1146, 197 L. Ed. 2d 442 (2017). In 
addressing a similar California statute, the Ninth Circuit recently held that the statute violated First Amendment commercial free 
speech rights. Italian Colors Restaurant v. Becerra, 878 F.3d 1165, 1179 (9th Cir. 2018)."
962,10," Magistrate Judge James Orenstein, who has been ably managing the discovery and other matters in this litigation for many 
years, decided the Class Counsel motions. "
963,11," In 2017, Class Plaintiffs moved to amend their Complaint. (See Class Pls. Mot. for Leave to Amend Compl., Docket Entry No. 
6880.) On August 30, 2018, after finding that the amended pleadings related back to earlier complaints under Rule 15(c), the 
Court affirmed Plaintiffs' ability ""to amend the Complaints to assert an alternative, two-sided market theory following the Second 
Circuit's decision in United States v. Am. Express Co., 838 F.3d 179 (2d Cir. 2016), aff'd sub nom. Ohio v. Am. Express Co., --- 
U.S. ---, 138 S. Ct. 2274, 2285, 201 L. Ed. 2d 678 (2018)."" In re Payment Card Interchange Fee & Merch. Disc. Antitrust Litig., 
No. 05-MD-1720, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 148316, 2018 WL 4158290, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 30, 2018). In United States v. 
American Express Company, the Second Circuit held that ""[t]he District Court erred in excluding the market for cardholders from 
its relevant market definition."" 838 F.3d at 197."
963,12," On April 27, 2018, the Court dismissed the claims and actions of Crystal Rock, LLC without prejudice. (Stipulation and Order 
of Dismissal dated Apr. 27, 2018, Docket Entry No. 7197 (stating, however, that ""[a]ll discovery taken of Crystal Rock, LLC . . . 
will remain in the factual record"").) As a result, Crystal Rock, LLC is not listed as a Class Plaintiff in the Superseding Settlement 
Agreement, and the Court does not consider the facts as to Crystal Rock, LLC in this Memorandum and Order. (See 
Superseding Settlement Agreement ¶ 3(ii); TAC ¶ 14.)"
963,13," In the TAC, the Rule 23(b)(3) Class Plaintiffs list the Defendants as ""Visa U.S.A., Inc., Visa International Service Association, 
and Visa, Inc. ('Visa'), MasterCard International Incorporated ('MasterCard'), and the other Defendants named in th[e] Complaint 
('Bank Defendants') . . . ."" (See TAC ¶ 2.) "
964,14," Although reductions from the $6.25 billion figure will be made in accordance with the number of class members that choose to 
exclude themselves from the settlement, the award figure will not be reduced below approximately $5.56 billion. (See Mem. in 
Supp. or Prelim. Approval 1.)"
964,15," ""Settlement Final Date"" is defined as the business day after the affirmation by any appeals court of this Court's final approval 
of the proposed settlement. (See Superseding Settlement Agreement ¶ (3)(ss).) According to Class Counsel, this effectively 
means that ""[t]he release will bar claims that have accrued within five years following . . . the exhaustion of all appeals."" (Mem. in 
Supp. of Prelim. Approval 23.)"
964,16," The Court notes that documents and filings refer to the Rule 23(b)(2) action in a variety of ways. The Rule 23(b)(2) action is 
proceeding in this MDL as Barry's Cut Rate Stores Inc. et al. v. Visa, Inc., et al., No. 05-MD-01720. The action is sometimes 
referred to as ""Barry's"" and the class is sometimes referred to as the ""equitable relief class."" For the purposes of consistency 
across opinions, the Court uses the terms ""Rule 23(b)(2)"" and ""injunctive relief"" to refer to the action, as opposed to ""Barry's"" 
and ""equitable relief."" "
965,17," Prior to the November 1, 2018 status conference, on October 30, 2018, the Court received a letter, notifying the Court of an 
intention to object to preliminary approval of the Superseding Settlement Agreement. (Letter notice of intention to object to 
proposed settlement dated Oct. 30, 2018 (""Letter of Intention to Object""), Docket Entry No. 7280.) On November 15, 2018, Rule 
23(b)(3) Class Counsel filed a response to the October 30, 2018 letter. (Rule 23(b)(3) Class Counsel's response to Branded 
Operators' letter of October 30 dated Nov. 15, 2018 (""Class Counsel's Nov. 15 Response""), Docket Entry No. 7294.) On 
November 23, 2018, Rule 23(b)(3) Class Counsel filed a response to the objections that were ultimately filed on November 20, 
2018. (Rule 23(b)(3) Class Counsel's Response to Objections to Class Settlement Dkts. 7299, 7300, 7301 dated Nov. 23, 2018 
(""Class Counsel's Nov. 23 Response""), Docket Entry No. 7303.)"
965,18," (See Statement of Obj. Regarding the Proposed Class Settlement by Leathers Enterprises, Inc., Docket Entry No. 7299; Mem. 
in Opp'n to Prelim. Approval of Class Settlement (""Mem. in Opp'n to Prelim. Approval""), Docket Entry No. 7300; Statement of 
Obj. Regarding the Proposed Class Settlement by the National Association of Shell Marketers, the Petroleum Marketers 
Association of America, and the Society of Independent Gasoline Marketers of America, Docket Entry No. 7301.)"
965,19," Valero Energy Corporation and Valero Marketing and Supply Company are listed as Dismissed Plaintiffs. (See Dismissed 
Plaintiffs, annexed to Superseding Settlement Agreement as App. B.) ""Dismissed Plaintiffs,"" as defined in the Superseding 
Settlement Agreement, means: the individual plaintiffs and former opt-out plaintiffs that have dismissed with prejudice an action against any Defendant and 
that are listed in Appendix B [of the Superseding Settlement [**113]  Agreement], and any additional persons, businesses, 
or other entities included in an exclusion request that those plaintiffs previously submitted to the Class Administrator in 
connection with the [Original] Settlement Agreement. (Superseding Settlement Agreement ¶ 3(t).) The Branded Operators object to the fact that the content of the exclusion requests 
have not been disclosed to the Court or putative class members, and have not been included with the proposed class notice. 
(See Mem. in Opp'n to Prelim. Approval 20.) "
967,20," Among other things, the new amendments set forth standards under Rule 23(e)(1)(B)(i—ii) that a district court must ensure 
are met prior to a grant of preliminary approval of a proposed settlement, and factors under Rule 23(e)(2) that a district court 
must now consider when evaluating whether to grant final approval of a proposed settlement. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e). "
968,21," It appears that a ""likelihood standard"" now guides a district court's analysis of whether to grant preliminary approval. That is, a 
district court must assess whether the parties have shown that the court will likely be able to grant final approval and certify the 
class. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 advisory committee's note to 2018 amendment (""The decision to give notice of a proposed 
settlement to the class is an important event. It should be based on a solid record supporting the conclusion that the proposed 
settlement will likely earn final approval after notice and an opportunity to object.""). "
969,22," The Court finds that the following Grinnell factors do not appear to be addressed by the Rule 23(e)(2) factors: the ability of the 
defendants to withstand a greater judgment; the range of reasonableness of the settlement fund in light of the best possible 
recovery; and the range of reasonableness of the settlement fund to a possible recovery in light of all the attendant risks of 
litigation."
969,23," The Court notes that, based on the objections received during the preliminary approval process, as compared to the 
objections received during the prior preliminary approval process for the Original Settlement Agreement before Judge Gleeson, it 
appears that the class' reaction to the Superseding Settlement Agreement is more favorable, as the Court has received fewer 
objections both in volume and substance. (See, e.g., Objecting Pls. Opp'n to Class Pls. Mot. for Prelim. Approval of Proposed 
Class Settlement, Docket Entry No. 1681 (objecting to preliminary approval on behalf of the majority of the named plaintiffs in 
the action); Amicus Br. From ATMIA Challenging Prelim. Approval of Class Settlement, Docket Entry No. 1683 (objecting to 
preliminary approval on behalf of the ATM Industry Association on the basis that the definition of the settlement class was 
overbroad, the scope of the injunctive relief, and the breadth of the release); Am. Retailers & Merchants' Obj. to Proposed Class 
Settlement Agreement, Docket Entry No. 1701 (objecting to preliminary approval on behalf of a wide range of businesses, 
including retailers, restaurants, oil companies, and pharmacies, and objecting on the basis that the size of the settlement fund 
was inadequate, that the release was excessive and overbroad, that the attorneys' fees were excessive, and that the injunctive 
relief was in adequate).) "
970,24," Although both the Rule 23(e) and Grinnell factors are meant to guide a court's final approval analysis, as alluded to supra, in 
consideration of the new Rule 23 likelihood standard applicable to the preliminary approval process, the Court looked to these 
final approval factors in determining whether the Court will likely grant final approval. The Court nevertheless recognizes that it 
cannot engage in a complete analysis at the preliminary approval stage, and, as other courts in this Circuit have held, ""it is not 
necessary to exhaustively consider the factors applicable to final approval"" at this stage. In re Platinum & Palladium 
Commodities Litig., No. 10-CV-3617, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 96457, 2014 WL 3500655, at *12 (S.D.N.Y. July 15, 2014). Critical 
information as to whether a proposed settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate, will be obtained through the notice and opt-
out process, and the final fairness hearing."
970,25," This adequate representation factor is nearly identical to the Rule 23(a)(4) prerequisite of adequate representation in the class 
certification context. As a result, the Court looks to Rule 23(a)(4) case law to guide its assessment of this factor. As a 
prerequisite to bringing a class action, Rule 23(a)(4) requires that ""the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the 
interests of the class."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4); see also Amchem Prods. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 592, 117 S. Ct. 2231, 138 L. 
Ed. 2d 689 (1997) (""To gain certification under Rule 23(b)(3), a class must satisfy the requirements of Rule 23(a), among them, 
that named class representatives will fairly and adequately protect class interests.""). In addition, because this factor guides the 
Court's analysis of the procedural, as opposed to substantive fairness of the settlement, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 advisory 
committee's note to 2018 amendment, the Court also looks to case law that assesses the procedural fairness of proposed 
settlements, see, e.g., In re Giant Interactive Group., Inc. Securities Litigation, 279 F.R.D. 151, 160 (S.D.N.Y. 2011) (noting that 
when evaluating whether a proposed settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate, ""a Court must consider 'both the settlement's 
terms and the negotiating process leading to settlement,' that is, it must review the settlement for both procedural and 
substantive fairness,"" and noting that the Grinnell factors are used to guide a court's analysis of substantive fairness (quoting 
Wal-Mart Stores, 396 F.3d at 116)). "
972,26," The Court acknowledges that the issue of competing claims is a genuine issue that will need to be addressed in the future. At 
the hearing on the Superseding Settlement Agreement, the Court heard from the parties on the matter, and expressed the belief 
that the issue could be taken care of through a subsequent administrative process. (Hr'g Tr. 11:16-11:18.) The Court notes that a 
nearly identical issue arose in In re Visa Check/Mastermoney Antitrust Litigation, 297 F. Supp. 2d 503 (E.D.N.Y. 2003). There, 
the court appointed a special master to resolve disputes over claims that did ""not fit within the category of challenges 
contemplated by the Settlement Agreement and Plan of Allocation."" See In re Visa Check/Mastermoney Antitrust Litig., No. 96 
CV-5238 (E.D.N.Y.), Order dated Jan. 19, 2006, Docket Entry No. 1244. "
973,27," In addition to citing Amchem, the Branded Operators also reference the Second Circuit's decision to overturn the prior 
settlement approval, to support their argument that the Superseding Settlement Agreement should not be preliminarily approved 
""because it includes class member with competing claims for settlement proceeds for the same merchant transactions."" (See, 
e.g., Mem. in Opp'n to Prelim. Approval 7, 14.) As summarized in other Sections of this opinion the conflict recognized in the 
Second Circuit's decision concerned the issue of unitary representation for two separate classes, and involved concern over an 
entire class potentially receiving ""nothing."" This does not provide support for the Branded Operator's concern regarding 
competing class members' contractual or other rights to receive settlement funds. "
974,28," The Court finds the Branded Operators' argument that Class Counsel has not adequately represented the Branded Operators 
unconvincing. (See generally Mem. in Opp'n to Prelim. Approval 15-18.) The Branded Operators' argument rests on the 
assumption that ""[C]lass [C]ounsel is inherently conflicted based on its representation of a class that contains dueling class 
members."" (Id. at 15.) As elaborated upon elsewhere in this opinion, the Court finds that disagreement over the right to the funds 
does not amount to an intra-class conflict that would affect the Court's adequate representation analysis. The Branded 
Operators' argument assumes that they are class members deserving of Class Counsel's representation, which may not be the 
case, pending the outcome of any dispute over who has rights to settlement funds. Class Counsel does not have a duty to 
represent the Branded Operators in their dispute with other entities over which entities hold those rights. "
975,29," Green also served as a settlement mediator in In re Visa Check/Mastermoney Antitrust Litigation, 297 F. Supp. 2d 503 
(E.D.N.Y. 2003), a class action antitrust case brought by merchants against Visa and Mastercard, where the Second Circuit 
affirmed the district court's approval of the settlement and plan of allocation. See also Wal-Mart Stores, 396 F.3d at 117 
(affirming the district court's agreement with Green's opinion that the proceedings operated with procedural integrity)."
975,30," As to the fourth factor, the Court confirmed at the hearing that there are no agreements under Rule 23(e)(3) that the Court 
must review. (Hr'g Tr. 33:9-33:17.) "
977,31," As summarized by Class Counsel, Defendants previously moved to dismiss on the following bases: (i) that the release in the In re Visa Check case released all of Class Plaintiffs' damages and injunctive-relief claims; (ii) that 
the complaint failed to allege a ""restraint on trade"" sufficiently to state a claim under § 1 of the Sherman Act; (iii) that the 
complaint failed to allege a ""plausible"" inter-network conspiracy under Bell Atlantic v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 127 S. Ct. 
1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007); (iv) that Twombly barred the complaint's allegations of post-IPO conspiracies within Visa 
and Mastercard; and (v) that Class Plaintiffs' claims were barred by the doctrine [**143]  of Illinois Brick. (Wildfang Decl. ¶ 107.) Although raising affirmative defenses in and of itself weighs in favor of settlement, the Court does not 
take a position on whether Defendants would be successful on such defenses. Instead, the Court simply acknowledges that the 
existence of affirmative defenses presents risk to Class Plaintiffs."
977,32," In support of the Original Settlement Agreement, Class Plaintiffs submitted a declaration from former District Judge Charles B. 
Renfrew, assessing the risks of further litigation. (See Decl. of Charles B. Renfrew as to the Risks of Litigation (""Renfrew Decl.""), 
Docket Entry No. 2111-4.)"
977,33," ""[I]n 2008 and 2006, respectively, initial public offerings ('IPOs') converted [Visa and Mastercard] from a consortium of 
competitor banks into single-entity, publicly traded companies with no bank governance."" Interchange Fees I, 986 F. Supp. 2d at 
215."
977,34," In weighing antitrust liability, courts apply either the rule of reason, or the per se rule in determining whether restraints of trade 
violate Section 1 of the Sherman Act. Under a rule of reason analysis, courts weigh whether the alleged anticompetitive harm "
978,," outweighs the procompetitive benefits of the behavior at issue. See Leegin Creative Leather Prods. v. PSKS, Inc., 551 U.S. 877, 
877, 127 S. Ct. 2705, 168 L. Ed. 2d 623 (2007) (""The rule distinguishes between restraints with anticompetitive effect that are 
harmful to the consumer and those with procompetitive effect that are in the consumer's best interest.""); see also Interchange 
Fees I, 986 F. Supp. 2d at 227 (noting that in this action, ""the prospect that [the networks' rules] anticompetitive effects remain 
outweighed by [their] procompetitive ones is real.""). In contrast, some antitrust restraints are deemed per se unlawful. See 
United States v. Apple, Inc., 791 F.3d 290, 314 (2d Cir. 2015) (noting that in contrast to ""vertical"" agreements, ""'horizontal' 
agreements . . . which involve coordination 'between competitors at the same level of [a] market structure,' . . . with limited 
exceptions, [are deemed] per se unlawful."" (first citing and quoting Anderson News, L.L.C. v. Am. Media, Inc., 680 F.3d 162, 182 
(2d Cir. 2012); and then citing Leegin Creative Leather Prod., Inc., 551 U.S. at 893)). Although for the purposes of this opinion 
the Court need not make a finding as to whether the rule of reason or per se rule would apply in determining antitrust liability, the 
Court notes that Judge Gleeson found that ""the setting of default interchange fees would almost certainly be evaluated under the 
Rule of Reason."" Interchange Fees I, 986 F. Supp. 2d at 227. Similarly, in Ohio v. Am. Express Co., both parties acknowledged, 
and the Supreme Court affirmed, that American Express' antisteering provisions constituted vertical restraints ""i.e., restraints 
imposed by agreement between firms at different levels of distribution,"" that should be assessed under the rule of reason test. 
Ohio v. Am. Express Co. (""American Express""), 138 S. Ct. at 2284 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); see also 
Allied Tube & Conduit Corp. v. Indian Head, Inc., 486 U.S. 492, 501, 108 S. Ct. 1931, 100 L. Ed. 2d 497 (1988) (noting that 
given the potential for ""significant procompetitive benefits,"" standard-setting by private associations is typically evaluated under 
the rule of reason)."
978,35," The Court expressly does not draw any conclusion regarding how the Supreme Court's decision in American Express might 
impact Class Plaintiffs' claims if the case were to proceed to trial, and only acknowledges that the case affects the overall 
assessment of risk. "
979,36," The Court notes that the Supreme Court's recent decision in American Express, 138 S. Ct. 2274, 201 L. Ed. 2d 678, may 
increase the difficulty Class Plaintiffs face in proving damages. "
981,37," Judge Gleeson based his award in part on the ""enormous"" risk that Class Counsel undertook in bringing the litigation. In re 
Payment Card Interchange Fee, 991 F. Supp. 2d at 441. He also found the injunctive relief that accompanied the monetary fund 
to weigh in favor of a larger attorney fee award because ""the settlement constitutes a significant step toward remedying the 
merchants' complaints about interchange rates in Visa and MasterCard credit card transactions . . . . [and because] the 
merchants' newly acquitted ability to surcharge the use of credit cards at the product level has great value."" Id.; id. at 442 
(""When the rules changes are combined with the massive damages fund, the settlement must be labeled a significant 
success.""). He determined that a lodestar multiplier of 3.41, for a lodestar amount of approximately $160 million, was 
reasonable. Id. at 447-48."
981,38," While Class Counsel's representation that they will seek ""up to ten percent"" of the fund for attorneys' fees is not unreasonable, 
the Court notes that case law suggests that larger settlements warrant lower percentages of attorneys' fee awards. Because ""up 
to ten percent"" suggests that the amount Class Counsels will seek could vary from one through ten percent, this factor does not 
weigh against granting preliminary approval of the settlement."
981,39," Although on appeal the Second Circuit noted that ""Class [C]ounsel stood to gain enormously if they got the deal done,"" 
Interchange Fees II, 827 F.3d at 234, the Court was concerned with Class Counsel's lack of financial motivation to achieve 
greater gains for the (b)(2) class because ""counsel got more money for each additional dollar they secured for the (b)(3) class."" 
Id. Such a conflict no longer exists, and Class Counsel's sole duty in negotiating the current settlement is to maximize recovery 
for the (b)(3) class. "
982,40," Courts in the Second Circuit apply the six Goldberger v. Integrated Res., Inc., 209 F.3d 43 (2d Cir. 2000) factors in 
determining whether a fee is reasonable in common fund cases: ""(1) the time and labor expended by counsel; (2) the magnitude 
and complexities of the litigation; (3) the risk of the litigation . . . ; (4) the quality of representation; (5) the requested fee in 
relation to the settlement; and (6) public policy considerations."" Id. at 50 (citation and quotation marks omitted). The Court also 
notes that it will not necessarily adopt the graduated schedule that Judge Gleeson developed to calculate the previous attorney 
fee award. See In re Payment Card Interchange Fee, 991 F. Supp. 2d at 445."
982,41," Although this is not an official Rule 23(e)(2) or Grinnell factor, analysis of the release provision of the Superseding Settlement 
Agreement will assist in determining whether relief is adequate for the class. The Court also separately discusses the release 
provision because of the concerns raised by the Second Circuit in its decision to vacate the prior settlement approval. "
983,42," The Original Settlement Agreement provided ""that all of the injunctive relief will terminate on July 20, 2021."" Interchange Fees 
II, 827 F.3d at 230. "
984,43," Although (b)(2) Class Counsel originally expressed concern regarding the scope of ""injunctive relief claims"" that are preserved 
under the Superseding Settlement Agreement, (see Letter re Language in Settlement Agreement), following the parties' 
adjustments to the proposed preliminary approval order and the Class Notices, which further explain the extent to which such 
claims are preserved, (b)(2) Class Counsel subsequently informed the Court that it ""would not be filing an objection to the 
proposed [Superseding Settlement Agreement.]"" (Letter dated Jan. 18, 2019.) The Class Notices now expressly state that with 
respect to the (b)(2) injunctive relief action, the Release Provision in the Superseding Settlement Agreement does not release 
""injunctive relief claims,"" nor does it release ""the declaratory relief claims that are a predicate for the injunctive relief claims."" 
(Revised Class Notices G1-4, G2-11; Prelim. Approval Order ¶ 31.) Injunctive relief claims are claims that are understood ""to 
prohibit or require certain conduct."" (Id. at G1-4, G1-5, G2-11; Prelim. Approval Order ¶ 31.) The Class Notices further explain 
that claims for injunctive relief do ""not include claims for payment of money, such as damages, restitution, or disgorgement."" 
(Revised Class Notices G1-4, G1-5, G2-11; see also Prelim. Approval Order ¶ 31.) The Court approves and adopts this 
understanding of ""injunctive relief claims."" "
985,44," The parties also adjusted the Class Notices to clarify that the Release Provision does not extinguish, among other things: 
""[c]laims based on conduct or rules that could not have been alleged or raised in the litigation;"" ""[c]laims based on future rules 
that are not substantially similar to rules that were or could have been alleged or raised in the litigation;"" and/or ""claims that 
accrue more than five years after the court's approval of the settlement and the resolution of any appeals."" (See Class Notices 
G1-4, G2-10.) "
986,45," Some courts have expressed concern that the term ""similar"" when used in releases is broader than the Second Circuit's 
identical factual predicate test. See Oladapo, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 187299, 2017 WL 5956907, at *6 (expressing concern that 
the settlement agreement ""released not only claims arising out of conduct alleged in the Complaint, but also claims arising out of 
any 'similar' conduct""). Dr. Sykes, the court-appointed expert, also expressed concern that the inclusion of the phrase 
""'substantially similar' conduct or rules raises a danger of adverse, unintended consequences in a technologically dynamic 
industry."" (See Sykes Report 49-51.) "
988,46," Class Counsel should use their best efforts to provide the best possible recovery estimate when seeking final approval of the 
settlement. The Court recognizes, however, that it may be a difficult figure to generate, and, ultimately, this information, while 
helpful in assessing this factor, is not absolutely necessary. See, e.g., In re Facebook, Inc., IPO Sec. and Derivative Litig., No. 
12-MD-2389, 343 F. Supp. 3d 394, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 199829, 2018 WL 6168013, at *13 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 26, 2018) (finding 
that although ""particularized evidence ha[d] not been adduced to support a 'best possible' judgment, the agreed-upon figure 
[was] reasonable in light of the substantial risks to recovery.""); In re LIBOR-Based Fin. Instruments Antitrust Litig., 327 F.R.D. 
483, 2018 WL 3677875, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. 2018) (finding in a complex antitrust conspiracy action that calculation of recoverable 
damages was ""particularly complex"" and therefore concluding ""that an assessment of the 'best possible recovery' would be of 
little value in assessing the substantive fairness of the settlement.""); see also Frank v. Eastman Kodak Co., 228 F.R.D. 174, 186 
(W.D.N.Y. 2005) (""'The determination whether a settlement is reasonable does not involve the use of a 'mathematical equation 
yielding a particularized sum.'"" (quoting In re Austrian & German Bank Holocaust Litig., 80 F. Supp. 2d at 178)). "
992,47," In Dukes, the Supreme Court found that the class plaintiffs alleging discrimination on the basis of gender did not satisfy the 
commonality requirement of Rule 23(a)(2), because they had not offered evidence that Wal-Mart operated under a policy of 
discrimination. Dukes, 564 U.S. at 355 (""The only corporate policy that the plaintiffs' evidence convincingly establishes is Wal-
Mart's 'policy' of allowing discretion by local supervisors over employment matters. On its face, of course, that is just the opposite 
of a uniform employment practice that would provide the commonality needed for a class action.""). "
995,48," Class Counsel asserts that the following issues associated with Class Plaintiffs claims present common questions that would 
rely on class-wide evidence: (1) whether Defendants' conspired to fix and impose interchange fees, including whether Defendants require merchants to 
pay fixed interchange so as to fix the price of card acceptance services at supra-competitive levels; (2) whether Class 
Plaintiffs' price-fixing claims would be analyzed under the per se rule or the rule of reason; (3) whether the 
imposition [**198]  of the anti-steering rules insulated fixed interchange fees from competitive pressure; (4) the 
anticompetitive effects and procompetitive effects, if any, of Defendants' conduct; (5) the relevant market; (6) whether 
Defendants had market power; (7) whether Defendants willfully maintained monopoly power; (8) whether the restructuring 
agreements that resulted in Mastercard's and Visa's initial public offerings, and the IPOs themselves, are antitrust 
violations; (9) whether the NaBanco decision applies to the claims in this case; and (10) whether the Illinois Brick indirect 
purchaser doctrine is a defense to Plaintiffs' claims. (Mem. in Supp. of Prelim. Approval 36−37 (internal citations omitted) (citing Pls. Mem. of Law in Supp. of Class Pls. Mot. for 
Class Certification).) "
998,49," In addition to individualized notice, notice will be published in targeted language publications, general media, newspaper, and 
business publications, including, among other locations, the New York Times, Forbes [**206] , the Wall Street Journal, National 
Geographic, Sports Illustrated, People, and People en Español. (Azari Decl. ¶¶ 29−35.) ""The combined, measured media notice 
effort is estimated to reach 80.4% all U.S. Adults aged 18+ with an average frequency of 2.8 times, 84.2% of all US Business 
Owners with an average frequency of 3.2 times; and 84.4% of all US Adults in Business and Finance Occupations, with an 
average frequency of 3.4 times."" (Id. ¶ 22.) Banner advertisements will also be placed on websites. (Id. ¶¶ 36−42.) "
1001,1," On October 30, 2018, Wabtec additionally filed a motion seeking a protective order and a stay of discovery regarding the 
Amended Counterclaims, pending resolution of the instant Motion and the motion to dismiss. (D.I. 156) The Court subsequently 
denied that motion on January 8, 2019. (D.I. 180) "
1003,2," In their briefing, the parties addressed most or all of the factors relating to severance/joinder decisions cited in the above 
paragraph. That said, the parties (citing to non-patent cases) each utilized different tests for resolving motions to sever. Wabtec, 
for example, asserted that the Court should utilize a five-factor test (which appears to include most or all of the factors 
referenced in the paragraph above): ""(1) whether the claims arise out of the same transaction or occurrence; (2) whether the 
claims present some common questions of law or fact; (3) whether settlement of the claims or judicial economy would be 
facilitated; (4) whether prejudice would be avoided if severance were granted; and (5) whether different witnesses and 
documentary proof are required for the separate claims."" (D.I. 147 at 4-5 (citing Karlo v. Pittsburgh Glass Works, LCC, No. 2:10-
cv-1283, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 141057, 2015 WL 6134052, at *2 (W.D. Pa. Oct. 16, 2015)). Siemens, for its part, did not 
directly address the two Rule 20-related factors at all, instead focusing on the following three-factor analysis: ""(1) the 
convenience of the parties; (2) avoiding prejudice; and (3) expedience and economy."" (D.I. 158 at 3 (citing Graudins v. Retro 
Fitness, LLC, 921 F. Supp. 2d 456, 467-68 (E.D. Pa. 2013)). "
1005,3," The Court assumes that were the Amended Counterclaims not severed, they would ultimately be bifurcated for trial from 
Wabtec's patent claims Cf. Orthophoenix, LLC v. Dfine, Inc., No. CV 13-1003-LPS, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 61417, 2015 WL 
1938702, at *1 (D. Del. Apr. 28, 2015) (bifurcating an antitrust counterclaim from an affirmative patent infringement case relating 
to 15 patents-in-suit); see Ciena Corp. v. Corvis Corp., 210 F.R.D. 519, 521 (D. Del. 2002) (holding that ""bifurcation is an 
important discretionary tool that district courts can use in patent cases to ensure that the cases are resolved in a just manner by 
juries that understand the complex issues before them.""). Thus, the Court need not consider Wabtec's argument that to add the 
Amended Counterclaims to this ""already complex patent infringement case . . . will . . . make the trial unmanageable for the 
Court and the jury."" (D.I. 147 at 11)"
1005,4," With all of the above said, the Court makes no final decision here on whether the instant action and any newly-filed action that 
includes Siemens' currently-filed Amended Counterclaims should be consolidated for pre-trial purposes pursuant to Federal Rule 
of Civil Procedure 42."
1005,5," Regarding Siemens' concern about having to ""repeat the entire motion to dismiss briefing stage"" if severance is granted, (D.I. 
158 at 5), that is not going to happen. When the new case is filed, and assuming there is no material change to the substance of 
Siemens' allegations, a responsive pleading will be filed on an abbreviated timeline and the entire motion to dismiss briefing 
package will simply be re-filed at once in the new case. (D.I. 168 at 7) Additionally, the Court expects that the parties' cross-use 
discovery agreement will apply to the new case. (Id.) "
1008,1," The facts as stated herein are taken as alleged in the FAC, (ECF No. 107)."
1008,2," The Polluting Vehicles consist of the following Mercedes models powered by B1ueTEC diesel engines: ML 320, ML 350, GL 
320, E320, S350, R320, E Class, GL Class, ML Class, R Class, S Class, GLK Class, GLE Class, and Sprinter. (FAC ¶ 18). "
1012,3," Bosch also argues that the R320 and GLE types of the Polluting Vehicles should excluded from the claims because, ""Plaintiffs 
have no standing to pursue claims based on Affected Vehicles that they did not purchase or lease."" (ECF No. 118-1 at 13-14). 
This argument is premature at the motion to dismiss stage. Luppino v. Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC, No. 09-5582, 2013 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 161689, 2013 WL 6047556, at *6 (D.N.J. Nov. 12, 2013) (finding that ""dismissal of Plaintiffs' claims related to 
vehicle/wheel/tire combinations Plaintiffs did not purchase would be premature"" at the motion to dismiss stage). "
1016,4," Plaintiffs diminished value theory is articulated as follows: ""Moreover, when and if Mercedes recalls the Polluting Vehicles and 
degrades the BIueTEC Clean Diesel engine performance and fuel efficiency in order to make the Polluting Vehicles compliant 
with EPA standards, Plaintiffs and Class members will be required to spend additional sums on fuel and will not obtain the 
performance characteristics of their vehicles when purchased. Moreover, Polluting Vehicles will necessarily be worth less in the 
marketplace because of their decrease in performance and efficiency and increased wear on their cars' engines."" (FAC ¶ 332). "
1019,5," The actionability of the misstatements as puffery are addressed infra Section III.B.3.iv. To the extent Bosch claims that 
Plaintiffs are trying to enforce compliance with emissions standards, that argument is addressed by Parts III.B.2.i and III.C. "
1023,6," Duramax also explicitly rejects ""Bosch's repeated argument that Plaintiffs must specifically allege that Bosch used the mail or 
wire to defraud,"" as ""simply, wrong,"" and notes that even though the plaintiffs had not ""specifically alleged the date of the 
applications or the specific identity of the employee who prepared them,"" the plaintiffs had ""alleged enough detail to put 
Defendants on notice of the alleged predicate acts."" Id. "
1025,7," The key cases that Defendants rely on in support of their express preemption argument, such as Morales v. Trans World 
Airlines, Inc., 504 U.S. 374, 112 S. Ct. 2031, 119 L. Ed. 2d 157 (1992), Jackson v. Gen. Motors Coip., 770 F. Supp. 2d 570 
(S.D.N.Y. 2011), and Detroit Diesel Corp. v. AG (In re Quash Subpoenas Duces Tecum), 269 A.D.2d 1, 709 N.Y.S.2d 1 (App. 
Div. 2000), have already been discussed at length and distinguished appropriately by the four cases cited in this paragraph. As 
such, in the interest of judicial economy, the Court refers the parties to the appropriate discussion of these cases in Volkswagen, 
FCA, Duramax, and Counts. "
1026,8," Mercedes' challenges to fraudulent concealment claims under laws other than New Jersey's are few. Defendant alleges that 
there is no private cause of action for fraudulent concealment under Connecticut law, (ECF No. 117-1 at 48 n.17 (citing Traylor 
v. Awwa, 899 F. Supp. 2d 216, 224-25 (D. Conn. 2012))), and argues that a commercial transaction does not give rise to a duty 
to disclose under Illinois law, and thus mirrors New Jersey law, (ECF No. 117-1 at 52 n.22). The Court agrees with Plaintiffs 
regarding Connecticut law, in that Connecticut recognizes claims for fraudulent concealment but calls them fraud by 
""suppression"" or ""nondisclosure."" Reville v. Reville, 312 Conn. 428, 441, 93 A.3d 1076 (2014) (""Fraud by nondisclosure . . . 
involves the failure to make a full and fair disclosure of known facts connected with a matter about which a party has assumed to 
speak, under circumstances in which there is a duty to speak. . . . A lack of full and fair disclosure of such facts must be 
accompanied by an intent or expectation that the other party will make or will continue in a mistake, in order to induce that other 
party to act to her detriment.""). As to the question of whether Defendants had a duty to disclose under Illinois law, that question 
is answered below. "
1027,9," Mercedes does not brief the Court on the differences in the laws of the various state subclasses with respect to reliance and 
fraudulent concealment. To the extent that Mercedes purports to rely on Appendix A to its brief, that attachment does not provide 
state-specific legal citation or information beyond a boilerplate statement that there was a ""[f]ailure to satisfy Rule 9(b) with 
respect to reliance, by failing to allege the what and when of the purported fraud."" (e.g., ECF No. 117-2 at 4 (referencing Plaintiff 
Roberts)). Thus, the Court declines to do a state-by-state analysis on the differing requirements for pleading reliance in 
fraudulent concealment claims at this stage. See Counts, 237 F. Supp. 3d at 597 (deciding that ""the Court will not sua sponse 
analyze the elements of fraudulent concealment from each state's law that Plaintiffs purport to sue under"" where the defendant 
did not specifically raise the argument). "
1028,10," Bosch ignores the aspect of the duty to disclose that flows from a previous false statement and instead only focuses on the 
existence of a special relationship. (ECF No. 118-1 at 59)."
1028,11," As to Mercedes' contention that Illinois law would also not impose a duty to disclose in this scenario, that argument fails. See 
Heider v. Leewards Creative Crafts, 245 Ill. App. 3d 258, 613 N.E.2d 805, 814, 184 Ill. Dec. 488 (1993) (""Mere silence in a 
business transaction does not amount to fraud. Yet, silence accompanied by deceptive conduct or suppression of material facts 
gives rise to active concealment; it is then the duty of the party which has concealed information to speak.""). "
1052,1," See explanation of plaintiff classes, infra. The three motions, as docketed in the consolidated MDL (Case No. 2:18md2836), 
are ECF No. 157 (Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs); ECF No. 160 (Retailer Plaintiffs); and ECF No. 162 (End Payor Plaintiffs)."
1052,2," According to Defendants, Plaintiffs incorrectly identified Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Inc., USA as ""Glenmark Generics Inc., 
USA"" in their Complaints. Br. Supp. Mot. Dismiss EPP Compl. 1 (ECF No. 163 at 1). "
1053,3," The named class representatives for the DPPs are FWK Holdings, LLC; Rochester Drug Cooperative, Inc.; and Cesar Castillo, 
Inc. DPP Compl. 3-4."
1053,4," The named class representatives for the EPPs are the Sergeants Benevolent Association Health & Welfare Fund; United Food

Fund of the Uniformed Firefighters' Association of Greater New York Security Benefit Fund; and United Food and Commercial 
Workers Local 1500 Welfare Fund. "
1056,5," Although the three motions addressed in this Report are directed to three different complaints, the factual allegations describing 
the anticompetitive conduct are generally the same. HN10[
] Each motion to dismiss requires the court to accept all facts 
alleged in the complaint as true and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff. Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, 178 
F.3d 231, 244 (4th Cir. 1999)."
1056,6," The Retailer Complaints and the EPPs' Consolidated Complaint recite substantially identical allegations to those contained in

1058,7," In April 2011, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued its decision in Ex parte Tanaka, 640 F.3d 1246 (Fed. Cir. 
2011). In Tanaka, the court held that reissue was a proper remedy for a patentee seeking to add dependent claims ""as a hedge 
against possible invalidity of original claims."" Id. at 1249. Plaintiffs argue that while this decision functionally overturned the basis 
for the district court's partial summary judgment grant in the earlier Merck-Glenmark litigation, it had no impact on Glenmark's 
other meritorious claims of invalidity. DPP Compl. ¶¶ 227-28. "

] Dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) is ordinarily with prejudice unless the court specifically orders dismissal without prejudice. Carter v. Norfolk Community Hosp. Ass'n, Inc., 761 F.2d 970, 974 (4th Cir. 1985). That determination is within the 
district court's discretion. Id. Given the early posture of this class action, this Report recommends without-prejudice dismissal of 
certain state consumer protection claims if the addition of specific new class members or additional facts learned in discovery 
might permit the claim to proceed. However, no party has requested leave to amend. "

1072,13," The EPPs have not asserted state antitrust claims in the states which follow Illinois Brick, see e.g., Vacco v. Microsoft Corp., 
260 Conn. 59, 793 A.2d 1048 (Conn. 2002) (holding indirect purchasers lack standing to assert antitrust claims under 
Connecticut antitrust statute). "
1073,14," Records of the notices may be found in MDL Member Case No. 2:18cv108, ECF Nos. 54-1 to -5. In each instance the EPPs

some or all of the purchase price of Zetia or its AB-rated generic equivalents in any form, other than for resale, from 
December 6, 2011 through and until the antitcompetitive effects of Defendants' unlawful conduct cease (the ""Class 
Period""). EPP Compl. ¶ 311 (ECF No. 130 at 83)."
1080,19," This nuance in state consumer protection laws distinguishes this issue from, for example, the question of whether the EPPs 
can assert an antitrust claim in Utah even though no named class representative resides there. See supra section V.D.3.e. 
Analogous antitrust laws in the named representatives' respective states do not restrict third-party payors from bringing claims. "
1081,20," It is also not unique to Zetia, ezetimibe, or any particular drug; the EPPs simply reimburse consumers for some portion of all

1084,25," This Report rejected similar Illinois Brick-circumvention challenges to consumer protection claims in some jurisdictions, but did 
so because state authority made clear that those claims were independently actionable or otherwise not barred by Illinois Brick. 
By contrast, little if any state authority exists to support common-law unjust enrichment claims by indirect purchasers alleging 
antitrust injury in jurisdictions following Illinois Brick. "

1103,1," By order filed January 22, 2019, the Court took the motion under submission."
1103,2, The following facts are taken from the Counterclaims.
1103,3," ""Flow cytometry is a powerful, laser-based technology used for identifying and quantifying cellular characteristics on a cell-by-
cell basis that offers a variety of biomedical and therapeutic applications."" (See id. ¶ 1.)"
1103,4," ""Reagents are essential consumable substances used in flow cytometers to identify and analyze certain cellular 
characteristics,"" and ""are marketed and sold separate and apart from the cytometry machines themselves."" (See id. ¶ 19.) "
1104,5," In its Opposition, Cytek clarifies that it ""is seeking injunctive relief under the UCL, not restitution."" (See Opp. at 22:18-19.)"
1104,6," In their respective memoranda filed in connection with the instant motion, neither party discusses the ""fraudulent"" prong."
1104,7," Although Cytek alleges ""BD has made similar threats to other potential Cytek customers"" (see id. ¶ 21), the allegation is entirely 
lacking in factual support. "
1107,8," Although Cytek alleges it ""has learned of repeated instances of BD and its sales representatives making false statements of 
fact about Cytek's products and practices"" (see id. ¶ 33), the allegation is lacking in any factual support beyond the above-
referenced instance."
1107,9," Although Cytek characterizes the ""holdover clauses"" (see id. ¶ 54) as ""illegal"" and, consequently, unlawful, Cytek also alleges 
BD's use of such contractual provision is ""unfair"" (see id. ¶ 51). In any event, BD does not challenge the sufficiency of the 
underlying factual allegations under either theory. "
1108,10," To the extent BD argues the alleged statement is privileged under California's litigation privilege, California's common interest 
privilege, and the Noer-Pennington doctrine, such argument is premature, given the absence of sufficient facts regarding the 
circumstances under which the statement was made. "
1112,1," The '921 patent was filed on August 23, 2012. The '921 patent is a continuation of Application No. 13/079,923, which was filed 
on April 5, 2011. This application is a continuation of Application No. 12/052,253, which was filed on March 20, 2008. Ni-Q 
asserts that Application No. 12/052,253 is a continuation-in-part of international application PCT/US2006/036827, which was 
filed on September 20, 2006, in accordance with the Patent Cooperation Treaty. Ni-Q argues that because the international 
application contains no disclosure of either the macronutrient ranges or the mammary fluid processing treatment mentioned in 
claim (1)(d) of the '921 patent, the chain of continuation is broken at this point and the '921 Patent therefore has the effective 
filing date of March 20, 2008."
1112,2," ""Any civil action for patent infringement may be brought in a judicial district where the defendant resides, or where the 
defendant has committed acts of infringement and has a regular and established place of business."" 28 U.S.C. § 1400(b). "
1113,3," The Noerr-Pennington doctrine is named after two cases: Eastern R.R. Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 
U.S. 127, 81 S. Ct. 523, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464 (1961) and United Mine Workers of Am. v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 85 S. Ct. 1585, 
14 L. Ed. 2d 626 (1965)."
1113,4," Federal Circuit law applies in analyzing whether federal law preempts Ni-Q's state law claim. See Globetrotter Software, Inc. v. 
Elan Computer Grp., Inc., 362 F.3d 1367, 1374 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (""We apply Federal Circuit law not only to the patent issues but 
also in deciding whether the patent laws preempt a state-law tort claim.""). "
1114,5," The Walker Process fraud exception comes from Walker Process Equipment, Inc. v. Food Machinery & Chemical Corp., 382 
U.S. 172, 86 S. Ct. 347, 15 L. Ed. 2d 247 (1965). "
1118,6," The Ninth Circuit sometimes discusses issue preclusion as requiring either the issue be ""necessarily decided"" or ""essential to 
the judgment,"" interchangeably. See United States v. Weems, 49 F.3d 528, 532 (9th Cir. 1995) (setting out the elements as 
including ""necessarily decided"" and then discussing the ""necessary to the judgment"" element as being the same element). The 
Court uses ""necessarily decided"" because the weight of Ninth Circuit authority describes the ""essential"" or ""necessary"" to the 
judgment element in this manner for issue preclusion. Additionally, the Ninth Circuit sometimes lists the elements for issue 
preclusion as: (1) the issue was necessarily decided; (2) the first proceeding ended with a judgment on the merits; and (3) the 
party against whom preclusion is sought was a party or in privity with a party in the first litigation. See Paulo, 669 F.3d at 917. 
The Court considers the latter two elements to be more appropriate elements for claim preclusion, see Howard, 871 F.3d at 
1039, although part of having a full and fair opportunity to litigate encompasses being a party or being in privity with a party. See 
Taylor, 553 U.S. at 892-93 (noting that ""[a] person who was not a party to a suit generally has not had a 'full and fair opportunity 
to litigate' the claims and issues settled in that suit"" and then discussing several exceptions to that rule). "
1127,1," On October 16, 2018, the Court ruled on Defendants' joint and individual motions to dismiss the Sherman Act claims in the 
operative consolidated class action complaints brought on behalf of the Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs (""DPPs""), the End-Payer 
Plaintiffs (""EPPs""), and the Indirect-Reseller Plaintiffs (""IRPs"") with respect to the Group 1 drugs. In re Generic Pharms. Pricing 
Antitrust Litig., 338 F. Supp. 3d 404 (E.D. Pa. 2018). The Court reserved judgment with respect to Defendants' motions to the 
extent they sought to dismiss the state law claims brought on behalf of the Group 1 EPPs and IRPs. Id. at 434. This Opinion 
disposes of those motions."

of Civil Procedure require a defendant to plead an affirmative defense, like a statute of limitations defense, in the answer, not in 
a motion to dismiss.""). "
1163,1," Defendants' Motion to Dismiss is separated into two briefs. The first brief addresses Counts One (Violation of RICO), Two 
(Conspiracy to Violate RICO), Three (Violation of the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act Against Novo), Four (Violation of the "
1164,," New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act Against Sanofi), and Five (Violation of the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act Against Novo and 
Sanofi). (ECF No. 158-1.) The second brief focuses on Counts Six through Fifty-Nine, violations of the consumer fraud laws of 
the various states. (ECF No. 158-2.)"
1164,2," The Plaintiffs frequently use the terms ""benchmark price"" and ""sticker price"" to refer to the AWP. (ECF No. 131 ¶¶ 1, 2, 174.)"
1164,3," PBMs are retained by health insurance companies to manage their prescription drug benefits and negotiate, specifically for 
discounts, with drug companies and pharmacies on behalf of the health insurance companies. (ECF No. 131 ¶ 166.) PBMs do 
not purchase prescription drugs, nor do they make any payments to manufacturers. (Id.) PBMs typically do not take possession 
of drugs either, however, some PBMs operate mail-order pharmacies and purchase drugs from wholesalers solely in their 
capacity as a seller to the consumer. (ECF No. 131 ¶¶ 7, 166.) "
1165,4," The ""net price"" refers to the revenue obtained by the manufacturer after subtracting the rebate amounts it negotiates and pays 
to PBMs. (ECF No. 131 ¶¶ 169, 170 fig. 3.) The net price may fluctuate as it necessarily depends on a particular PBM's 
negotiation. (ECF No. 131 ¶ 171.) "
1168,5," Specifically, Plaintiffs allege ""[t]he Defendant Drug Manufacturers intended that the PBMs would (and did) distribute, through 
the U.S. mail and interstate wire facilities, promotional and other materials which claimed that rebates saved health care payers 
and consumers like the plaintiffs and class members money on their prescription needs."" (ECF No. 131 ¶ 321(f).) "
1169,6," The Supreme Court has also defined an association-in-enterprise, for RICO purposes, as ""a group of persons associated 
together for a common purpose of engaging in a course of conduct."" United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 583, 101 S. Ct. 
2524, 69 L. Ed. 2d 246 (1981)."
1169,7," Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that ""[e]ach manufacturer-PBM Enterprise also shares a common purpose of perpetuating use of 
insulin benchmark prices as the basis for consumer cost-sharing and out-of-pocket payments in the pharmaceutical industry . . . 
these corporations would not be able to market large spreads to PBMs in exchange for formulary positions without the use of the 
inflated benchmark prices as the basis for consumer cost-sharing and out-of-pocket payments in the pharmaceutical industry."" 
(ECF No. 131 ¶ 302.) Plaintiffs further alleged that ""[e]ach of the Manufacturer-PBM Insulin Pricing Enterprises has a systemic 
linkage because there are contractual relationships, financial ties, and continuing coordination of activities between each 
Defendant Drug Manufacturer and each PBM that is an associate."" (ECF No. 131 ¶ 303.) "
1172,8," Similarly, Plaintiffs' reliance on the Second Circuit's decision in Desiano v. Warner-Lambert Co., 326 F.3d 339 (2d Cir. 2003) is 
also misplaced. (ECF No. 181 at 36.) Desiano concerned an antitrust action to recover alleged overpayments made to a drug 
manufacturer, however, unlike in this matter, the relief sought included ""only the portion of the prescription paid [directly] by the 
[healthcare providers] and exclude[d] the part paid by the patients, in the form of a 'co-pay.'"" Id. at 345. "
1173,9," Additionally, this Court disagrees with Plaintiffs' reliance on Sedima, 479 U.S. at 498-99. Although Sedima postulates that 
""RICO is evolving into something quite different from the original conception of its enactors,"" id. at 500, and even suggests that 
interpreting its elements in identical fashion to those under antitrust law may play a role in such evolution, id. at 498-99, it does 
not at all mention the indirect purchaser rule and certainly provides no analysis tending to suggest a preference that such rule 
not be applied in the RICO context. "
1174,10," McCarthy notes ""the fact that the [subject costs] were passed on [from an intermediary] to [the plaintiffs] on a dollar for dollar 
basis . . . is not dispositive. Indeed, the subcontractors in Illinois Brick and the utility companies in Utilicorp passed on their costs 
to the plaintiffs in those respective cases; yet the Supreme Court deemed this fact insufficient to confer standing to the indirect-
purchaser plaintiffs in those cases."" 80 F.3d at 853. "
1177,11," Defendants' motion to dismiss each count herein is only denied as to the extent that such counts may be dismissed on other 
grounds. "
1178,12," Those counts include: Count Seven (Alabama); Count Eight (Alaska); Count Fourteen (Connecticut) Count Fifteen (Delaware); 
Count Sixteen (Washington, D.C.); Count Twenty (Hawaii); Count Thirty-Nine (New Hampshire); Count Forty-Two (North 
Carolina); Count Forty-Three (North Dakota); Count Forty-Five (Oklahoma); Count Forty-Eight (Rhode Island); Count Forty-Nine 
(South Carolina); Count Fifty (South Dakota); Count Fifty-Five (Virginia); County Fifty-Six (Washington); Count Fifty-Seven (West 
Virginia); and County Fifty-Nine (Wyoming). "
1179,13," Those counts are, as to Novo: Count Thirteen (Colorado); County Thirty (Massachusetts); Count Thirty-Five (Missouri); and 
Count Thirty-Eight (Nevada). As to Sanofi, the counts include: Count Twenty-Seven (Louisiana); County Twenty-Nine 
(Maryland); Count Thirty-Four (Mississippi); Count Forty-Seven (Pennsylvania); and Count Fifty-One (Tennessee)."
1179,14," Similarly, this Court is unpersuaded by Plaintiffs' argument that Riaubia v. Hyundai Motor Am., No. 16-5150, 2017 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 133846, 2017 WL 3602520 (Aug. 22, 2017) supports its position. Like Marcus, Riaubia deals with ""absent [class] 
members [who] were allegedly injured by the same non-conforming feature of different models of the same product, 
manufactured or distributed by the same defendants based on uniform representations."" 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 133846, [WL] at 
*2 (emphasis added)."
1179,15," This Court notes that, while many decisions from this District have held that claims concerning products that a plaintiff has not 
alleged to have used nor purchased cannot stand, ""[c]ourts in this district are divided on this issue."" Neuss v. Rubi Rose, LLC, 
No. 16-2339, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 83444, 2017 WL 2367056, at *5 (D.N.J. May 31, 2017). In Neuss, this District declined to 
grant a defendant's motion to dismiss claims against one defendant from plaintiffs who had neither purchased nor used their 
product, on the basis that (1) the class-action plaintiffs had the same basis for each defect among the different products, (2) the 
products were closely related, and (3) all of the claims were against only two defendants. Id. Unlike in this matter, however, one 
of the defendants in Neuss was a subsidiary and agent of the other. 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 83444, [WL] at *2. "
1180,16," Those eight counts are: Count Seven (Alabama); Count Eighteen (Georgia); Count Twenty-Six (Kentucky); Count Twenty-
Seven (Louisiana); Count Thirty-Four (Mississippi); Count Thirty-Six (Montana); Count Forty-Nine (South Carolina); and Count 
Fifty-One (Tennessee)."
1180,17," Defendants' motion to dismiss each count herein is only denied as to the extent that such counts may be dismissed on other 
grounds."
1180,18," Those six counts are: Count Nine (Arizona); Count Sixteen (Washington, D.C.); Count Twenty-One (Idaho); Count Twenty-Six 
(Kentucky); Count Thirty (Massachusetts); and Count Fifty-Four (Vermont). "
1181,19," This Court did not provide an analysis for its decision to grant Defendants' motion to dismiss Count Twenty-Six, pleading a 
violation of the Kentucky Consumer Protection Act, as Plaintiff conceded that such Act requires direct privity of contract, which 
its Complaint failed to allege. (ECF No. 181 at 69.) Additionally, this Court also did not provide an analysis of Defendants' privity 
of contract argument as to Count Sixteen, alleging a violation of the Washington D.C. Consumer Protection Procedures Act, or 
Count Thirty, alleging a violation of the Massachusetts General Law Chapter 93(A), as both counts were previously dismissed 
without prejudice for lack of standing."
1181,20," Those six counts are: Count Ten (Arkansas); Count Twelve (California); Count Eighteen (Georgia); Count Thirty-One 
(Michigan); Count Thirty-Eight (Nevada); and Count Forty-Seven (Pennsylvania)."
1181,21," Defendants' motion to dismiss each count herein is only denied as to the extent that such counts may be dismissed on other 
grounds."
1181,22," Those five counts are: Count Twenty-Two (Illinois); Count Thirty-Nine (New Hampshire); Count Forty-One (New York); Count 
Fifty-One (Tennessee); and Count Fifty-Eight (Wisconsin). "
1189,*, The Clerk of Court is respectfully directed to amend the official caption in this case as set forth above. 
1195,**," Judge Paul A. Engelmayer, of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation."
1195,1," Total Wine challenges the following provisions: (1) section 30-63 of the Connecticut General Statutes and section 30-6-B12 of 
the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies (referred to here as the ""post-and-hold"" provisions); (2) sections 30-68m(a)(1) 
and 30-68m(b) of the Connecticut General Statutes (the ""minimum retail price"" provisions); and (3) sections 30-63(b), 30-68(k), 
and 30-94(b) of the Connecticut General Statutes and section 30-6-A29(a) of the Regulation of Connecticut State Agencies (the 
""price discrimination prohibition"" provisions). In the ensuing discussion, the Court reproduces the central provisions. "
1196,2," Section 30-63(c) of the Connecticut General Statutes provides: For alcoholic liquor other than beer, each manufacturer, wholesaler and out-of-state shipper permittee shall post with the 
department, on a monthly basis, the bottle, can and case price of any brand of goods offered for sale in Connecticut, which 
price when so posted shall be the controlling price for such manufacturer, wholesaler or out-of-state permittee for the month 
following such posting. On and after July 1, 2005, for beer, each manufacturer, wholesaler and out-of-state shipper 
permittee shall post with the department, on a monthly basis, the bottle, can and case price, and the price per keg or barrel 
or fractional unit thereof for any brand of goods offered for sale in Connecticut which price when so posted shall be the 
controlling price for [**6]  such brand of goods offered for sale in this state for the month following such posting. Such 
manufacturer, wholesaler and out-of-state shipper permittee may also post additional prices for such bottle, can, case, keg 
or barrel or fractional unit thereof for a specified portion of the following month which prices when so posted shall be the 
controlling prices for such bottle, can, case, keg or barrel or fractional unit thereof for such specified portion of the following 
month. Notice of all manufacturer, wholesaler and out-of-state shipper permittee prices shall be given to permittee 
purchasers by direct mail, Internet web site or advertising in a trade publication having circulation among the retail 
permittees except a wholesaler permittee may give such notice by hand delivery. Price postings with the department setting 
forth wholesale prices to retailers shall be available for inspection during regular business hours at the offices of the 
department by manufacturers and wholesalers until three o'clock p.m. of the first business day after the last day for posting 
prices. A manufacturer or wholesaler may amend such manufacturer's or wholesaler's posted price for any month to meet 
a [**7]  lower price posted by another manufacturer or wholesaler with respect to alcoholic liquor bearing the same brand or 
trade name and of like age, vintage, quality and unit container size; provided that any such amended price posting shall be 
filed before three o'clock p.m. of the fourth business day after the last day for posting prices; and provided further such 
amended posting shall not set forth prices lower than those being met. Any manufacturer or wholesaler posting an 
amended price shall, at the time of posting, identify in writing the specific posting being met. On and after July 1, 2005, all 
wholesaler postings, other than for beer, for the following month shall be provided to retail permittees not later than the 
twenty-seventh day of the month prior to such posting. All wholesaler postings for beer shall be provided to retail permittees 
not later than the twentieth day of the month prior to such posting."
1196,3," Section 30-68m of the Connecticut General Statutes provides, in pertinent part: (a) For the purposes of this section: (1) ""Cost"" for a retail permittee means (A) for alcoholic liquor other than beer, the posted bottle price from the wholesaler 
plus any charge for shipping or delivery to the retail permittee's place of business paid by the retail permittee in addition to 
the posted price, and (B) for beer, the lowest posted price during the month in which the retail permittee is selling plus any 
charge for shipping or delivery to the retail permittee's place of business paid by the retail permittee in addition to the price 
originally paid by the retail permittee; (b) No retail permittee shall sell alcoholic liquor at a price below his or her cost. Relatedly, Section 30-68m(a)(3) defines ""bottle price"" as: [the] price per unit of the contents of any case of alcoholic liquor, other than beer [which] shall be arrived at by dividing the 
case price by the number of units [**9]  or bottles making up such case price and adding to the quotient an amount that is 
not less than the following: A unit or bottle one-half pint or two hundred milliliters or less, two cents; a unit or bottle more 
than one-half pint or two hundred milliliters but not more than one pint or five hundred milliliters, four cents; and a unit or 
bottle greater than one pint or five hundred milliliters, eight cents. "
1197,4," Section 30-68k of the Connecticut General Statutes provides: No holder of any wholesaler's permit shall ship, transport or deliver within this state or any territory therein or sell or offer for 
sale, to a purchaser holding a permit for [**10]  the sale of alcoholic liquor for on or off premises consumption, any brand of 
alcoholic liquor, including cordials, as defined in section 30-1, at a bottle, can or case price higher than the lowest price at 
which such item is then being sold or offered for sale or shipped, transported or delivered by such wholesaler to any other 
such purchaser to which the wholesaler sells, offers for sale, ships, transports or delivers that brand of alcoholic liquor 
within this state. Similarly, Section 30-63(b) of the Connecticut General Statutes provides: No manufacturer, wholesaler or out-of-state shipper permittee shall discriminate in any manner in price discounts between 
one permittee and another on sales or purchases of alcoholic liquors bearing the same brand or trade name and of like 
age, size and quality, nor shall such manufacturer, wholesaler or out-of-state shipper permittee allow in any form any 
discount, rebate, free goods, allowance or other inducement for the purpose of making sales or purchases. Nothing in this 
subsection shall be construed to prohibit beer manufacturers, beer wholesalers or beer out-of-state shipper permittees from 
differentiating in the manner in which their products are packaged on the basis of on-site or off-site consumption."
1197,5," Michelle H. Seagull replaced Jonathan Harris as Commissioner of the DCP on May 1, 2017. "
1198,6," Total Wine's claim that the Connecticut regulations promote horizontal price fixing was substantially developed in its briefs on 
the motion to dismiss and further refined on appeal. Its Complaint overwhelmingly focused instead on its claims as to vertical 
price fixing. We conclude, however, that the Complaint satisfactorily pled both theories. "
1199,7," These were: the Wine & Spirit Wholesalers of Connecticut (""WSWC""), the Connecticut Beer Wholesalers Association 
(""CBWA""), the Connecticut Restaurant Association (""CRA"") and the Connecticut Package Stores Association (""CPSA"") 
(collectively, ""the trade associations""), as well as Brescome Barton, Inc. (""Brescome"" and, with the trade associations, 
""intervenors"")."
1199,8," The district court stated that separate consideration of each challenged provision was required (1) under principles of 
federalism, (2) because each provision presented distinct analytic issues under principles of antitrust preemption, and (3) 
because Connecticut's general rule of statutory construction provides that the invalidity of some sections of a statute should not 
invalidate the statute as a whole. See Conn. Fine Wine & Spirits, 255 F. Supp. 3d at 366-67; Conn. Gen. Stat. § 1-3."
1199,9," The district court dismissed Total Wine's claims at the first step of the preemption analysis and neither the defendants nor any 
of the intervenors have argued that Total Wine's claims should be dismissed at the second step. "
1200,10," While we address the three areas separately here, we have also considered them in tandem. The outcome is the same: 
considered separately or as a whole, the provisions are not preempted. We therefore do not reach the question of which 
analysis would have been the right one had the difference been determinative. "
1201,11," In cases in which alcoholic-beverage laws are claimed to be preempted by § 1, states have sometimes additionally defended 
by asserting state action immunity, which is the second step in our Circuit's two-step preemption inquiry, and immunity derived "
1202,," from the Twenty First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Connecticut has not raised such defenses in connection with this 
appeal."
1202,12," Total Wine alternatively attempts to characterize minimum-retail-price provisions such as Connecticut's as impelling horizontal 
price-fixing. For the reasons given by the district court, this characterization is wrong. Conn. Fine Wine & Spirits, 255 F. Supp. 3d 
at 375. "
1203,13," Battipaglia addressed two other issues not presented here. It discussed—but did not resolve—whether, if the New York law 
were in conflict with § 1, it was nonetheless insulated from attack by the ""state action"" doctrine of Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S. 341, 
63 S. Ct. 307, 87 L. Ed. 315 (1943). See Battipaglia, 745 F.2d at 176-77. And it addressed whether, if the New York law were in 
conflict with § 1, the state's important policy interests warranted deference under § 2 of the Twenty-First Amendment. Id. at 177-
79 (holding that, on the case record, such deference was warranted). "
1204,14," As support for this view, the Court cited a district court decision finding against preemption and rejecting the argument that 
""simply because the statute compelled individual actions which, if taken pursuant to an agreement, might have constituted a 
violation,"" the statute was preempted. Id. at 173 (quoting United States Brewers Asso. v. Healy, 532 F. Supp. 1312, 1329-30 (D. 
Conn.), rev'd on other grounds, 692 F.2d 275 (2d Cir. 1982), aff'd, 464 U.S. 909, 104 S. Ct. 265, 78 L. Ed. 2d 248 (1983)). "
1206,15," In finding that the statute grants private actors ""a degree of private regulatory power"" so as to qualify as hybrid, Fisher, 475 
U.S. at 268, the district court relied on 324 Liquor, which had held hybrid a resale-price maintenance law with similar price-
posting features. See Conn. Fine Wines & Spirits, 255 F. Supp. 3d at 369. "
1209,*, The Clerk of Court is respectfully directed to amend the official caption in this case as set forth above.

the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies (referred to here as the ""post-and-hold"" provisions); (2) sections 30-68m(a)(1) 
and 30-68m(b) of the Connecticut General Statutes (the ""minimum retail price"" provisions); and (3) sections 30-63(b), 30-68k, 
and 30-94(b) of the Connecticut General Statutes and section 30-6-A29(a) of the Regulation of Connecticut State Agencies (the 
""price discrimination prohibition"" provisions). In the ensuing discussion, the Court reproduces the central provisions. "
1214,2," Section 30-63(c) of the Connecticut General Statutes provides: For alcoholic liquor other than beer, each manufacturer, wholesaler and out-of-state shipper permittee shall post with the

1220,11," In cases in which alcoholic-beverage laws are claimed to be preempted by § 1, states have sometimes additionally defended 
by asserting state action immunity, which is the second step in our Circuit's two-step preemption inquiry, and immunity derived 
from the Twenty First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Connecticut has not raised such defenses in connection with this 
appeal. "
1221,12," Total Wine alternatively attempts to characterize minimum-retail-price provisions such as Connecticut's as impelling horizontal 
price-fixing. For the reasons given by the district court, this characterization is wrong. Conn. Fine Wine & Spirits, 255 F. Supp. 3d 
at 375. "
1222,13," Battipaglia addressed two other issues not presented here. It discussed—but did not resolve—whether, if the New York law 
were in conflict with § 1, it was nonetheless insulated from attack by the ""state action"" doctrine of Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S. 341, 
63 S. Ct. 307, 87 L. Ed. 315 (1943). See Battipaglia, 745 F.2d at 176-77. And it addressed whether, if the New York law were in 
conflict with § 1, the state's important policy interests warranted deference under § 2 of the Twenty-First Amendment. Id. at 177-
79 (holding that, on the case record, such deference was warranted)."
1222,14," As support for this view, the Court cited a district court decision finding against preemption and rejecting the argument that 
""simply because the statute compelled individual actions which, if taken pursuant to an agreement, might have constituted a 
violation,"" the statute was preempted. Id. at 173 (quoting U.S. Brewers Ass'n, Inc. v. Healy, 532 F. Supp. 1312, 1329-30 (D. 
Conn.), rev'd on other grounds, 692 F.2d 275 (2d Cir. 1982), aff'd, 464 U.S. 909, 104 S. Ct. 265, 78 L. Ed. 2d 248 (1983)). "
1225,15," In finding that the statute grants private actors ""a degree of private regulatory power"" so as to qualify as hybrid, Fisher, 475 
U.S. at 268, the district court relied on 324 Liquor, which had held hybrid a resale-price maintenance law with similar price-
posting features. See Conn. Fine Wine & Spirits, 255 F. Supp. 3d at 369. "
1228,1," The affiliates named as defendants are News America Marketing, News America Marketing FSI L.L.C., and News America 
Marketing In-Store Services L.L.C. "
1229,2," News argues that statements made by News's CEO prior to February 4, 2010 (Pl. 56.1 ¶¶ 43, 51, 85) are inadmissible at trial, 
and thus should not be considered on summary judgment, as a result of a settlement agreement signed on that date by Valassis 
and News. In the settlement agreement, Valassis released all then-existing claims against News. (Doc. 244-5). Though the 
statements by News's CEO were made in 2004 and 2007, Valassis's present claims do not arise from these statements or the 
conduct described therein. Instead, the statements are offered and considered as some evidence of News's understanding of 
market dynamics and later intent in adopting market strategies. In an analogous context, the Second Circuit has held that where 
the statute of limitations for a Title VII employment discrimination claim expired on a certain date, ""any discrete acts occurring 
before that date are not actionable,"" but a court may still consider those acts as relevant ""background evidence."" Jute v. 
Hamilton Sundstrand Corp., 420 F.3d 166, 176 (2d Cir. 2005); see also Domenech v. New York City Employees' Ret. Sys., No. 
15-CV-2521 (ILG), 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 61175, 2016 WL 2644892, at *4 (E.D.N.Y. May 9, 2016) (""Although [plaintiff's] 
attempted termination is not actionable (the plaintiff released that claim as part of a settlement), . . . it is evidence of retaliatory 
intent.""). "
1232,3," ""Bidding,"" in this context, is a short-hand term for the process of purchasing a unit of input. Here, the negotiation and 
determination of payments by ISP providers to retailers constitute the ""bidding,"" while the prices ISP providers charge CPGs for 
ISP products are the ""pricing."""
1232,4," Valassis argues that Weyerhaeuser is inapposite because Weyerhaeuser ""did not concern a defendant that could leverage a 
monopsony over inputs to secure monopoly over outputs,"" citing to footnote 2 of the Weyerhaeuser decision. (Pl. Br. at 22-23, 
24 n.18). Footnote 2 appears to discuss the second prong of the price-cost test (recoupment), making the observation that 
monopsonists may recoup their costs after the exit of a rival either by decreasing payments on inputs or increasing prices on 
outputs. Weyerhaeuser, 549 U.S. at 321 n.2. Nowhere in Weyerhaeuser does the Court indicate that it intended to limit the 
application of the price-cost test to monopsonists that did not also wield monopoly power in the output market. The Court 
declines to read Weyerhaeuser so narrowly."
1232,5," It is undisputed that News's ISP business, as a whole, has been profitable in every year. (Def. 56.1 ¶ 6; Pl. 56.1 Resp. ¶ 6). "
1233,6," MacKie-Mason concludes that the Kmart payment was exclusionary, that the Ingles payment and the Giant Eagle payment 
were the ""next-most likely offers to have been exclusionary,"" while ""the next-most likely"" were the 2015 BI-LO/Winn Dixie 
payment and the 2011 Delhaize payment. (MacKie-Mason Rebuttal Report at 30)."
1233,7," The Second Circuit has adopted what has become known as the Areeda & Turner test. Irvin Indus., Inc. v. Goodyear 
Aerospace Corp., 974 F.2d 241, 245 (2d Cir. 1992). This test compares the actual prices charged for output against reasonably 
anticipated average variable cost. Id.; see also Northeastern Telephone Co. v. American Telephone & Telegraph Co., 651 F.2d 
76, 88 (2d Cir. 1981) (""We agree with Areeda and Turner that in the general case at least, the relationship between a firm's 
prices and its marginal costs provides the best single determinant of predatory pricing. Thus, prices below reasonably 
anticipated marginal cost will be presumed predatory, while prices above reasonably anticipated marginal cost will be presumed 
non-predatory. And because marginal cost cannot be determined from conventional accounting methods, we will use average 
variable cost as its surrogate."") (citations omitted) (footnote omitted). "
1234,8," In projecting the profitability of the Kmart contract, News created five scenarios under different sets of projected parameters. 
(MacKie-Mason Report at 100-01). In two of the scenarios, News projected a loss with incremental profit margins of -138% and -
60%. In three of the scenarios, News estimated earning incremental profit margins of 1.1% to 9%. (Id.). "
1237,9," For scale, MacKie-Mason estimates that Kroger and Safeway represented 34% of the ACV (all commodities volume) of food 
retailers participating in the ISP market in 2012. (MacKie-Mason Rebuttal Report at 28). "

1244,2," The AC does not state specify the capacity in which the State Defendants are being sued. I therefore assume Dr. Kaul intends 
to advance both official and individual capacity claims against these defendants."
1244,3," On December 22, 2016, Dr. Kaul moved for a default judgment against Dr. Moore, and then again on May 5, 2017. (ECF Nos. 
146, 194) On June 16, 2016, Dr. Moore moved to vacate the clerk's entry of default, dismiss the motion for default judgment, and 
join the co-defendants' omnibus motion to dismiss. Dr. Moore claims that he was never served the original complaint, filed in the 
S.D.N.Y., or this amended complaint, an issue that many defendants have raised. (ECF No. 194) Dr. Kaul responded on June 
29, 2017. (ECF No. 198) Because there exists good cause, because Dr. Moore has several meritorious defenses to Dr. Kaul's 
allegations, and because there is no prejudice to Dr. Kaul, who has responded to the omnibus motion, the motion is granted. "
1246,4," Another lawyer, not Hollenbeck or a member of his firm, but Charles Shaw, Esq., represented Dr. Kaul in the disciplinary 
proceedings."
1246,5," Here is an example, which purportedly ties Brach Eichler to ASIPP, Drs. Kaufman and Staats, and the Governor. It is 
representative of the approach of the AC: The American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians violated 18 U.S.C. § 1961 when it permitted its New Jersey 
chapter to conspire with the defendant governor, defendant state and defendant medical board to unlawfully obtain the 
plaintiffs property. Defendant Kaufman and Staats are senior board members of the defendant and its [**15]  New Jersey 
chapter. Staats was appointed the defendant's president in 2015 and along with defendant Kaufman competed with the "
1247,," plaintiff in the same market. Kaufman and Staats both receive patients from and refer patients to the defendant 
neurosurgeons, and used their positions of power within the defendant's political action committees to give money to the 
defendant governor. The business partner of defendant Staats was appointed to the defendant medical board by the 
defendant governor in 2014, in return for the money that the defendant's New Jersey chapter gave to the defendant 
governor. The money was given to defendant Brach Eichler by way of inflated legal fees, which were then siphoned to the 
defendant governor through political lobbying firms. The defendant governor rewarded defendant Staats by appointing his 
partner to the defendant medical board and by using his executive power to revoke the plaintiffs medical license. The 
plaintiff, in contrast to many of the defendants, never sought political patronage. (AC ¶ 81)"
1247,6," Gorrell's actions also ""contributed to the opiate epidemic that now plagues the state, because patients with spinal pain had had 
to resort to the use of opiates, consequent to the reduced availability and increased cost of minimally invasive spine surgery.""(Id. 
¶ 109)"
1247,7," Dr. Kaul specifically faults Dughi Hewit for declining to file a motion to disqualify the Deputy Attorney General from his case 
after Dr. Kaul filed an ethics complaint against her.(Id. ¶ 287) "
1248,8," The AG had been investigating Dr. Kaul since April 2012. A few days before the AG initiating the disciplinary action, on June 7, 
2012, Dr. Kaul attempted to enjoin the State and various state agencies from immediately suspending his controlled dangerous 
substance registration. That complaint was dismissed by the trial court, and then the appeal of that dismissal was dismissed by 
the Appellate Division in July 2012. (Def. Ex. E, F)"
1248,9," ""OptiMesh is a three[-]dimensional mesh bag to contain bone fragments. ' . . . mesh is simply a bag that contains bones and is 
not capable of maintaining the load of body weight and, therefore, it is not considered to be an appropriate prosthetic device for 
an interspace.""' (Order 2 n.1)"
1248,10," ""Allograft bone is obtained from a cadaver. Autograft bone is harvested from the patient's own body, often from the iliac crest."" 
(Order 17 n.5) "
1250,11," The Board, in adopting the ALJ's findings of fact as to T.Z., quoted Dr. Naseef directly on this point: [Dr. Naseef testified that] they were in a place I have never seen before . . . this one completely missed the pedicle and 
went directly through the lamina and into the vertebral body which putting screws in that is a completed different field. When 
you are not in bone, it's grossly abnormal."" (Order 18-19)"
1250,12," ALJ Solomon specifically found the ""testimony of each and every witness produced by [the Attorney General] . . . extremely 
credible and compelling"" while most of Dr. Kaul's witnesses lacked credibility or opined on irrelevant issues. (ALJ Op. 7879)"
1250,13," Over the objection of Dr. Kaul's counsel, the Attorney General admitted an independent (i.e., not official) transcript from one 
day of the 23-day hearing. Dr. Kaul had apparently appended the transcript to a letter addressed to President Obama, which he 
had posted on a personal website. ""It shows,"" the Board concluded, ""that Respondent's transcript and the official transcript had 
only minor insubstantial inconsistencies."" (Order 22)"
1250,14," In videos posted to his website, Dr. Kaul claimed that he was ""absolutely shocked"" by the ALJ's decision and pledged to 
continue to perform spine surgeries and teach others his methods. The plan, he said, was to open minimally invasive spine 
surgery clinics in places where people lack access to affordable spine care, such as Africa, Mexico, and Colombia. (Id. 22-23)"
1250,15," In March 1999, while practicing medicine in England, a patient for whom Dr. Kaul had administered anesthesia died. About 
two years later, in February 2001, a jury convicted Dr. Kaul of gross negligence and manslaughter. From September 2000 to 
May 2001, Dr. Kaul made a number of false or misleading statements about those criminal proceedings, the related disciplinary 
proceedings, and later, the conviction, in a number of documents submitted to the Board and New Jersey hospitals. (ALJ Op. 
90-92) For example, on April 8, 2011, Dr. Kaul submitted an application for privileges at HUMC. He was asked the following question: 
""Please indicate if you have been ever been convicted of any criminal offense, excluding minor traffic violations, e.g., passing a 
stop sign, (if yes, give details on a separate sheet.)"" Kaul checked the ""NO"" box, even though he had been convicted of 
manslaughter just a few months earlier. "
1252,16," Claiming inadequate service of process, GEICO, Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett, and Crist moved to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. 
Civ. P. 12(b)(4). Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett, and Crist also move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction pursuant to Fed. R. 
Civ. P. 12(b)(2). "
1253,17," A motion for leave to file a second amended complaint was denied without prejudice in January 2017 for failure to attach a 
proposed pleading. (ECF No. 156) "
1254,18," As it happens, records of Dr. Kaul's proceedings before the Board are posted on the Board's website. See 
http://www.njconsumeraffairs.gov/bme/Pages/actions.aspx. "
1255,19," No party has raised the applicability, or not, of Colorado River abstention in light of UNN-L332-15, which involves many of 
parties and all of the same causes of action in this case. 424 U.S. 800, 96 S. Ct. 1236, 47 L. Ed. 2d 483 (1976). "
1256,20," That is also why the Santos case, UNN-L332-15, cannot be the basis of Rooker-Feldman dismissal. As far as the Court is 
aware, there was no final judgment entered in that case as of the time this action was commenced, and there does not appear to 
have been a final judgment even now."
1256,21," The only other case cited by defendants, Harris v. N.Y. State Dep't of Health, 202 F. Supp. 2d 143, 150-51 (S.D.N.Y. 2002), 
involved a doctor who actually appealed the revocation of his medical license to a New York state court."
1256,22," The Bank defendants argue that Rooker-Feldman dismissal is appropriate on grounds unique to them. Around April 2009, TD 
Bank became the holder of a $1 million loan that another bank had made Dr. Kaul and his companies. In 2012, he defaulted on 
that loan; on March 22, 2013, TD Bank obtained a default judgment against Dr. Kaul and his businesses. Attempting to enforce 
the judgment, the Bank Defendants allegedly ""defraud[ed] the plaintiff of his right to sell his Manhattan townhouse"" and ""used 
false pretenses to obstruct [] the townhouse and force it into foreclosure."" (E.g. AC ¶¶ 184-85) Dr. Kaul, the Bank defendants 
conclude, is thus a state-court loser complaining of injuries caused by a state-court judgment rendered before this case was 
filed, which he invites me to review and reject. Dr. Kaul, however, does not assert claims based on injuries caused by the state court judgment itself, but rather injuries 
traceable to the Bank Defendants' attempts to enforce that that judgment. See, e.g., B.S. v. Somerset County, 704 F.3d 250, 
260 (3d Cir. 2013) (holding that suits seeking redress for injuries traceable to defendants' actions, rather than the state court 
orders themselves, are not barred by Rooker-Feldman). Nor does Dr. Kaul explicitly ask this court to invalidate the judgment. 
Post-Exxon, a court must be cautious in applying Rooker-Feldman where the federal claims do not directly clash with the state 
claims, but are merely ""intertwined"" with them. See, e.g., Gary v. Braddock Cemetery, 517 F.3d 195, 200 n.5 (3d Cir. 2008)) 
(advising caution in employing pre-Exxon Third Circuit precedent interpreting Rooker-Feldman). The Rooker-Feldman doctrine 
does not apply to the claims against the Bank defendants. "
1258,23," At least with respect to allegations of altered transcripts, the Board noted that the single instance of such alteration provided 
by Dr. Kaul contained only ""minor insubstantial inconsistencies."" (Order 22)"
1258,24," Even if this reference to reinstatement and expungement were construed as a claim for equitable or declaratory relief, the law 
of this Circuit would mandate a stay, not outright dismissal, of the AC. See, e.g., Marran, 376 F.3d at 155. To look at it another away, consider this. The central insight of Younger is that a federal court should not grind important and 
presumptively lawful state processes to a halt by granting discretionary equitable relief. To do otherwise would unduly interfere in 
a state's sovereign prerogatives, which is why the ""normal thing to do"" is to withhold the requested relief and dismiss the case. 
E.g., New Orleans Pub. Serv., Inc. v. Council of New Orleans, 491 U.S. 350, 359, 109 S. Ct. 2506, 105 L. Ed. 2d 298 (1989) (Or, 
where both an injunction and damages are requested, stay the case and let the state proceedings run their course.) In this case, 
the administrative proceedings, while technically still pending, have essentially concluded. The time for Dr. Kaul to appeal the 
Board's Order lapsed long ago. The primary objective of AC appears to be to obtain money damages. I am confident that, to the "
1259,," extent Dr. Kaul intended to plead it, the discretionary equitable relief requested here will not unduly interfere with any state 
proceedings or objectives."
1259,25," Same reasoning applies to Zahl v. Harper, 282 F.3d 204 (3d Cir. 2002), in which a doctor tried to get a district court to enjoin 
the State from bringing disciplinary proceedings. The Third Circuit ruled that the district court appropriately dismissed the case 
on abstention grounds."
1259,26," The Bank Defendants claim that their default judgment against Dr. Kaul injects special jurisdictional considerations as to the 
claims against them. There is no analysis, however, why that may be the case. Because the Bank Defendants have failed to 
argue, let alone show, that Younger abstention is triggered by its March 22, 2013 default judgment or the subsequent 
foreclosure proceedings, I will not abstain from hearing the claims as to them."
1259,27," AC ¶ 63 (""Warren Buffet[t] is the Chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, which is the parent company of GEICO. The 
defendant is liable for illegal acts to which there exists a nexus to the aforementioned corporations. The protections of the 
corporate veil become forfeited when the majority of shareholders are ignorant as to the existence of the illegal acts. The illegal 
act was the alteration of court transcripts by the defendant state, which deprived the plaintiff of his Constitutional right to due 
process and which caused damage to the plaintiff's estate and reputation. The defendant violated the Racketeer and Influenced 
Corruption Act when he conspired by willful ignorance with the defendant Governor to revoke the medical license of the 
plaintiff."")"
1259,28," Because I dismiss the AC pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) as to Crist, Berkshire Hathaway, and Buffett, I do not reach these 
defendants' arguments that dismissal is warranted for lack of sufficient process and personal jurisdiction. "

658 F.3d 792, 794 (7th Cir. 2011) (noting that a private claim under the Hobbs Act is ""obviously frivolous""). "
1261,30," H&S and Hollenbeck advance a res judicata argument based on orders from another action. The facts necessary to perform 
the appropriate analysis, however, are not apparent from the face of die complaint or other documents properly considered on a 
motion to dismiss. On August 25, 2014, H&S obtained a default judgment against Dr. Kaul in die amount of $97,886.96 for unpaid legal services. 
Almost two years later, in June 2016, Dr. Kaul filed a motion to vacate the judgment and sought leave to file an answer, 
counterclaims, and third party complaint. The proposed counterclaims and third party complaint asserted RICO, Hobbs Act, mail 
fraud, wire fraud, honest services fraud, and violations of constitutional rights against the Governor, the Board, and Drs. 
Peterson and Heary. On October 6, 2016, the motion to vacate was denied. (Def. Ex. Q) S&H and Hollenbeck do not identify which order—the August 2014 default judgment or the October 6, 2016 denial of the motion 
to vacate—they believe carries preclusive effect. Presumably they mean the default judgment; if so, I still cannot discern from 
the face of the complaint and the appropriate documents the relationship between the $97,886.96 worth of legal fees Dr. Kaul 
owed S&H and the $196,000 S&H allegedly ""attempted to extort"" from Dr. Kaul weeks before the August 2013 disciplinary 
hearings. The answer to that question would be best explored on a motion for summary judgment, not to dismiss."
1261,31," The doctrine rests on considerations of fairness and efficiency: Under die entire controversy doctrine, a party cannot withhold part of a controversy for separate later litigation even when 
the withheld component is a separate and independently cognizable cause of action. The doctrine has three purposes: (1) 
complete and final disposition of cases through avoidance of piecemeal decisions; (2) fairness to parties to an action and to 
others with a material interest in it; and (3) efficiency and avoidance of waste and delay. See DiTrolio v. Antiles, 142 N.J. 
253, 662 A.2d 494, 502 (N.J. 1995). As an equitable doctrine, its application is flexible, with a case-by-case appreciation for 
fairness to the parties. Paramount Aviation Corp. v. Agusta, 178 F.3d 132, 137 (3d Cir. 1999). "
1263,32," New Jersey's Antitrust Act is essentially a replica of the federal Sherman Antitrust Act. See, e.g., N.J. Stat. § 56:9-1, et seq."
1263,33,"  In comparison to federal preclusion principles, New Jersey has adopted a broader definition of ""privity."" See Opdycke v. 
Stout, 233 F. App'x 125, 129 n. 6 (3d Cir.2007). ""In New Jersey, privity is merely a word used to say that the relationship 
between the one who is a party on the record and another is close enough to include that other within the res judicata.""

2005) (citation and quotation omitted). Furthermore, New Jersey courts are more likely to find ""privity"" when a party to the 
first litigation attempts an end-run around the entire controversy doctrine by either bringing suit under a different name or "
1264,," naming related entities as defendants. See Hamburg Music, 2005 U.S. App. LEXIS 21140, 2005 WL 2170010, at *3

1264,34," Without further facts, I will not imply a duty to amend the prior Complaint. The case law seems to indicate that the question 
turns on when the plaintiff knew about the cause of action. See Cafferata v. Peyser, 251 N.J. Super 256, 260-61, 597 A.2d 1101 
(Super. Ct. App. Div. 1991). "
1265,35," Congress did not abrogate the States' sovereign immunity when it enacted section 1983, e.g., Quern v. Jordan, 440 U.S. 332, 
342, 99 S. Ct. 1139, 59 L. Ed. 2d 358 (1979), the Sherman and Clayton Acts, e.g., Jackson v. Conn. Dep't of Pub. Health, 3:15-
CV-750 (CSH), 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 80672, at *40-42 (D. Conn. June 20, 2016), Gebman v. State, No. 07-cv-1226 (GLS-
DRH), 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46125, at *11-13, 2008 WL 2433693 (N.D.N.Y. June 12, 2008), or the RICO statute, Dianese v. 
Pennsylvania, Civil Action No. 01-2520, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10917, at *17 (E.D. Pa. June 19, 2002). The Third Circuit, and 
later the Supreme Court, held that Congress could abrogate state sovereign immunity with its commerce clause powers. See 
United States v. Union Gas Co., 832 F.2d 1343, 1356 (3d Cir. 1987), affirmed, 491 U.S. 1, 109 S. Ct. 2273, 105 L. Ed. 2d 1 
(1989). That decision, however, was overruled in Seminole Tribe v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 116 S. Ct. 1114, 134 L. Ed. 2d 252 
(1996)."
1265,36," They may remain potentially liable as persons in their individual capacities, however. See Hafer v. Melo, 502 U.S. 21, 25, 112 
S. Ct. 358, 116 L. Ed. 2d 301 (1991); Estate ofLagano v. Bergen Cnty. Prosecutor's Office, 769 F.3d 850, 856 (3d Cir. 2014)."
1265,37," To the extent they are private citizens, they probably lack ""person"" status to be sued under section 1983, however. See infra 
Part IV.B. "
1267,38," These defenses—especially qualified immunity—ordinarily parry alleged violations of constitutional rights; it is somewhat 
atypical for a public official to shield themselves from violations of federal statutes, such as the RICO or antitrust laws, with 
absolute or qualified immunity. Nevertheless, there is persuasive authority that absolute and qualified immunity applies to RICO 
claims, and none of it appears to be disputed. See, e.g., Cullinan v. Abramson, 128 F.3d 301, 308-312 (6th Cir. 1997) (applying 
qualified and absolute immunity to RICO claims); Van Beek v. Ag-Credit Bonus Ptnrs., 316 F. App'x 554, 555-56 (9th Cir. 2008) 
(applying judicial and prosecutorial immunity to RICO claims); Parette v. Virden, 173 F. App'x 534, 536 (8th Cir. 2006) (applying 
absolute immunity analysis to RICO claims). As to antitrust claims, there seems to be no authority directly on point. There is no reason to think, however, that the Sherman or 
Clayton acts abridged the common law immunity from damages suits ""for all persons—governmental or otherwise—who were 
integral parts of the judicial process."" Briscoe, v. Lahue, 460 U.S. 325, 335-36, 103 S. Ct. 1108, 75 L. Ed. 2d 96 (1983). And 
while the qualified immunity analysis has been honed in the context of alleged violations of civil or constitutional rights, there is 
no obvious reason to think that it cannot be performed in the context of antitrust claims. The debate in any case is academic; the 
AC fails to state a claim under the antitrust laws, which is essentially the first step in the qualified immunity analysis."
1267,39," The State does not assert that Drs. Przybylski and Kaufman are absolutely immune for claims arising from their testimony, or 
that Chiesa is entitled to prosecutorial immunity. I therefore do not reach those issues. Again, because it is not clear whether Drs. Przybylski or Lomazow are state officials, I do not reach the qualified immunity 
question as to them. To the extent the motion is denied, it is without prejudice as to them. "
1268,40," For the purposes of argument going forward, I assume that a plaintiff may obtain injunctive relief under RICO. Curley v. 
Cumberland Farms Dairy, 728 F. Supp. 1123, 1137-38 (D.N.J. 1989) (concluding that injunctive relief is unavailable under 
RICO); but see Steamfitters Local Union No. 420 Welfare Fund v. Phillip Morris, 171 F.3d 912, 935 n.20 (3d Cir. 1999) (""This 
court has yet to decide whether injunctive relief is available for a private party under RICO.""). "
1269,41," Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), by any person injured in her business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962. In 
order to state a claim under 1964(c), a plaintiff must plead ""(1) a section 1962 violation and (2) an injury to business or property 
by reason of such injury."" Lightning Lube, Inc., v. Witco Corp., 4 F.3d 1153, 1187 (3d Cir. 1993). To establish a claim under 
1962(a), ""a plaintiff must allege: (1) that the defendant has received money from a pattern of racketeering activity; (2) invested 
that money in an enterprise; and (3) that the enterprise affected interstate commerce."" Id. at 1189 (citation omitted). Establishing 
a pattern of racketeering requires allegations of ""at least two acts of racketeering activity within a ten-year period."" 18 U.S.C. § 
1961(5). Under section 1962(b), ""a plaintiff must show injury from the defendant's acquisition or control of an interest in a RICO 
enterprise, in addition to injury from the predicate acts"" of racketeering. Lightning Lube, 4 F.3d at 1190. To allege a claim under 
Section 1962(c), a plaintiff must plead conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. District 1199P Health & 
Welfare Plan v. Janssen, L.P., 784 F. Supp. 2d 508, 518-19 (D.N.J. 2011) (citation omitted). Section 1962(d) prohibits conspiring 
to violate sections (a)-(c). 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d). "
1270,42," Nor does the AC very specifically really adequately allege the use of the mails or interstate wires. There are a handful of 
exceptions. (E.g., AC ¶¶200-206, 208) Nevertheless, the letters or wires element is pled only generally and without reference to 
the interstate/intrastate distinction. (E.g., ¶ 200 (""Dughi + Hewit, LLC violated 18 U.S.C. § 1341 when it schemed to defraud the 
plaintiff of his property with false representations of the work it had performed and for which the plaintiff had paid it $7500. The 
defendant committed wire fraud when it caused these false representations to be transmitted by phone and internet.""); ¶ 201 
(""Andrew Kaufman violated 18 U.S.C. § 1341 when he communicated via phone and the internet that the plaintiff was not 
qualified to perform minimally invasive spine surgery.""). Nor is there is the relation, if any, of the use of wires or mails to the 
allegedly fraudulent scheme explained. At any rate, the substantive allegations of fraud for each of these allegations are far too 
thin and non-specific to state a claim for mail, wire, or honest services fraud."
1270,43," There is also a jurisdictional element; the statute applies to one who ""in any way degree obstructs, delays, or affects 
commerce or the movement of any article or commodity by robbery or extortion . . ."" 18 U.S.C. § 1951(a). The AC only 
sometimes alleges that the attempted extortion was an effort to obstruct, delay, or affect commerce. That would be an 
independent reason to dismiss many of these extortion claims. "
1271,44," It is not clear whether the representation was related to the administrative proceedings. (AC ¶ 76 (""The defendant defrauded 
the plaintiff of approximately $200,000 with false representations that it had performed legal work in preparation for the plaintiffs 
OAL hearing. The defendant then attempted to extort $196,000 from the plaintiff two weeks before the OAL hearing was meant 
to commence with the threat that they would abandon the case if the plaintiff did not pay the money within 24 hours of the 
demand."") "
1272,45," I quote three of the conspiracy allegations, which are typical. See, e.g., AC ¶ 74 (alleging that Staats ""conspired with the 
defendant governor, defendant medical board and defendant state in a scheme whose purpose was to revoke the plaintiff's 
medical license . . . Defendant is regularly in Washington, DC meeting with Congressmen and US Senators, and the defendant 
society of which he is the President, has an active political donation apparatus. The defendant's business partner was appointed 
to the defendant medical board by the defendant governor in approximately 2014, and was involved in the attempt by the 
defendant medical board to extort $450,000 from plaintiff.""); AC 1177 (Hollenbeck ""conspired with the defendant governor, 
defendant state and defendant medical board to extort money from the plaintiff under the color of right, with a threat two weeks 
before the OAL hearing, that he would withdraw legal services if the plaintiff did not pay $196,000 within twenty-four hours. The 
defendant . . . is a member of the New Jersey Republican Party. The defendant has close professional and commercial ties with 
the defendant governor and defendant attorney general and has given money to the Republican Party. The defendant has 
offices in both Trenton and Washington, DC.""); AC ¶ 125 (alleging that GEICO ""conspired with the defendant governor and his 
executive agencies to impose a $450,000 'fine' which they attempted to extort from the plaintiff when he made an application for 
license reinstatement in 2014"")."
1272,46," Specifically, the AC pleads violations of section 2 of the Sherman Act, which generally addresses single-firm conduct. Since 
this is a pro se plaintiff, I assume the AC intends to plead section 1 violations as well. "
1273,47," E.g., AC ¶ 94 (""The effect of the monopolization has been an increase in the cost of care and a reduction in the availability of 
clinical services."")"
1273,48," Noerr-Pennington, by the way, would probably apply to the RICO claims as well. Cf. We, Inc., v. City of Philadelphia, 174 F.3d 
322, 326-27 (3d Cir. 1999) (""This court, along with other courts, has by analogy extended the Noerr-Pennington doctrine to offer 
protection to citizens' petition activities in contexts outside the anti-trust area as well.""). "
1284,1," Defendants also argue that plaintiffs do not state breach of warranty claims as to any new products. The Court need not 
address this argument because it has already concluded that plaintiffs have no standing to bring any such claims. "
1286,2," Defendants also argue that plaintiffs do not state unjust enrichment claims as to any new products, but the Court need not 
address this argument because it has already concluded that plaintiffs have no standing to bring any such claims. "
1287,3," Defendants also argue that plaintiffs' claims fail under the various state statutes to the extent they seek relief for the purchase 
of new products. The Court need not address this argument because it has already explained that plaintiffs have no standing to 
assert claims for the purchase of new products. "
1288,4," In their opening brief, defendants made a similar argument about the Indiana Deceptive Consumer Sales Act (""IDCSA""), but in 
response, plaintiffs explained that that statute has recently been amended and expanded to cover omissions. Defendants 
apparently concede the point because they do not mention the statute at all in their reply. The Court considers defendants to 
have waived their argument on this point. "

1308,1," At the motion to dismiss stage, I accept the allegations of the non-moving party, here Neagle, as true."
1308,2," As discussed below, there is nothing sinister about these ""exclusive dealing arrangements."" The Services Agreement is a fairly 
standard contract one finds whenever one company agrees to provide set goods or services to another company over a given 
time period. As discussed below, Neagle fails to allege this agreement results in a substantial foreclosure of the market for third-
party default-related services market. "
1309,3, The parties agree the Court may take judicial notice of the deed of trust. 
1310,4," Neagle includes a history of the foreclosure proceedings, with multiple reinstatements of the action followed by later orders 
vacating the earlier orders. Neagle alleges MTQLQ intentionally violated the automatic stay after Neagle filed for bankruptcy and 
then instructed the sheriff to sell Neagle's property after the foreclosure was dismissed. SAC ¶¶ 87-97. But those actions are not 
part of the alleged conspiracy, and the parties agree that Neagle still owns the property. At this stage, these allegations are not 
particularly relevant to Nagle's claims alleging defendants conspired to violate antitrust and RICO laws by inflating the fees 
charged to Nagle for default related services. As discussed below, these allegations are only relevant to Neagle's financial elder 
abuse claim. "
1311,5," Although Giotta did not address whether notice there would be futile, Neagle's futility argument is, itself, futile. Neagle alleges 
defendants caused his debt to increase by over $14,000. SAC ¶ 70. Although Ocwen no longer services Neagle's loan, it could 
have decided to simply cut a check for that amount directly to Neagle. Alternatively, MTGLQ may have concluded reducing the 
amount of Neagle's debt is appropriate. Guessing what Ocwen or MTGLQ would have done had Neagle provided notice is 
purely speculative. "
1312,6," Neagle also seeks treble damages and an injunction under the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 15, 26. "
1314,7," While the alleged conspiracy would benefit Altisource in the ""third party default related services"" market, as described above, 
Neagle fails to provide any allegations as to Altisource's market power in that market."
1314,8," Neagle does not make even a half-hearted attempt at connecting MTGLQ to this conspiracy. As described below, the only 
specific factual allegations as to MTGLQ are that it now owns the mortgage and it filed a court document asking the Sheriff to 
conduct a foreclosure sale of Neagle's home. "
1315,9," As discussed below, Neagle's allegation regarding lender-placed insurance fails to support his claims as that claim was 
released as part of the class settlement. "
1317,10," Neagle is, at best, an indirect consumer of third-party default-related services. He is not a consumer, even indirectly, of 
nonbank subprime mortgage loan services. "
1319,11, Negale does not dispute that the final judgment in Lee is subject to judicial notice.
1319,12," Earlier in the SAC, Neagle alleges that Ocwen paid agents $45 to $50 for a BPO 10 years earlier, in 2004. SAC ¶ 65. "
1320,13," Ocwen points out that during the mandatory conferral process before filing motions, Neagle's attorney conceded he could not 
plead additional specific factual allegations. ECF No. 68, 40. "
1321,14," Other than the general allegations of a conspiracy between the defendants, there are no allegations that Altisource ever took, 
wrongfully or otherwise, any money or property of Neagle's."
1321,15," The Court does not intend to imply that Neagle has, in fact, adequately pleaded a conspiracy between Ocwen and Altisource. I 
merely point out that the SAC is hopelessly deficient in connecting MTGLQ to the alleged conspiracy."
1321,16," As noted, Neagle did not allege he gave any defendant notice and opportunity to cure before filing this action. "
1333,*, Senior Judge R. Lanier Anderson elected to participate in this decision pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 46(c).
1333,**," Judges Marcus, Rosenbaum, and Jill Pryor are recused. Judge Britt Grant joined the Court on August 7, 2018, and did not 
participate in these en banc proceedings. "
1334,1," Because this appeal is a consolidation of five separate cases, there are five separate complaints in the record. The parties 
agree that the five complaints are ""nearly identical,"" En Banc Br. of Body Shops, at 6 n.1, and that the complaint in the lead 
case, Quality Auto Painting Center v. State Farm, No. 15-14160, is representative. Accordingly, unless otherwise noted, citations 
to a complaint in this opinion are to paragraphs of that complaint."
1334,2," Each of the Insurance Companies who use DRPs has a unique name for their specific program. However, the term ""DRP"" 
appears to be widely used in the industry and, in any event, the parties here appear to prefer its usage when describing these 
programs generally."
1334,3," The survey sets the market rate just slightly above the rate offered by the median ""technician or work bay"" in the relevant area 
when those rates are listed from lowest to highest. The Body Shops assert that this is an invalid means of determining the rate 
because it does not take into account the variances in shop size, skill of technicians, and other quality variables, and that State 
Farm alters the shops' labor rates arbitrarily."
1334,4," None of the Body Shops here are currently a party to a DRP, and only one has apparently ever been. That relationship ended 
approximately one year before this action was filed. "
1335,5," According to the complaint, there are three leading collision repair estimating databases—ADP, CCC, and Mitchell—which 
""provide software and average costs associated with particularized types of repairs to create estimates."" Compl. ¶¶ 65-66. The 
databases generate estimates that include ""the ordinary and customary repairs, repair time (labor) and materials to return a 
vehicle to its pre-accident condition,"" and are considered reliable starting points. Id. at ¶ 66."
1335,6," The parties' filings and the district court's orders are less than clear about the total number of cases involved in this multidistrict 
litigation. It appears that there were, at one point, twenty-four independent causes of action with regard to this litigation: the 
twenty-two discussed above; a RICO class action that was filed in Illinois, was transferred to the Middle District of Florida, and is 
still currently pending; and a state consumer protection action filed by the State of Louisiana in Louisiana state court, removed to 
federal court in Louisiana by the Insurance Companies, transferred to the Middle District of Florida, and then remanded to 
Louisiana state court by the district court."
1335,7," The initial complaint in the lead case was dismissed without prejudice ""on the grounds that it was a prohibited 'shotgun' 
pleading, that it failed to properly set forth the basis for [the district c]ourt's jurisdiction, that it failed to identify which parties had 
ongoing contracts with one another, and that all of the allegations of wrongdoing were attributed, collectively, to every [Insurance 
Company], even where such collective attribution made no sense."" A&E Auto Body, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 127531, 2015 WL 
5604786, at *1 (M.D. Fla. Sept. 23, 2015). The Body Shops filed an amended complaint and the district court dismissed one 
claim with prejudice and the remainder of the claims without prejudice once again. Id. Finally, the district court dismissed all the 
claims from the second amended complaint with prejudice, noting that ""[d]espite becoming much wordier, the Plaintiffs' 
pleadings have not come remotely close to satisfying the minimum pleading requirements as to any of the claims asserted."" 
2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 127531, [WL] at *12."
1335,8," In New Jersey the correct label for this cause of action is ""tortious interference with prospective economic advantage;"" in 
Kentucky and Missouri it is ""tortious interference with business relations;"" and in Virginia it is ""tortious interference with a 
business relationship."" "
1336,9," The Body Shops alleged additional violations of state law founded on theories of quasi-estoppel, equitable estoppel, 
conversion, state antitrust statutes, and state consumer protection statutes—all of which were dismissed. The Body Shops did 
not challenge the dismissal of those claims and they are thus abandoned on appeal. See Greenbriar, Ltd. v. City of Alabaster, 
881 F.2d 1570, 1573 n.6 (11th Cir. 1989) (holding that issues not raised on appeal are deemed waived)."
1336,10," An identical R&R, Objection, and Dismissal Order was filed in each of the cases present on appeal."
1336,11, We recognize the tremendous effort that the district court expended in handling a multidistrict litigation of this scale. 
1337,12," Regarding the second element, certain behaviors have been held to be so ""plainly anticompetitive,"" National Society of 
Professional Engineers v. United States, 435 U.S. 679, 692, 98 S. Ct. 1355, 1365, 55 L. Ed. 2d 637 (1978), and to so often ""lack 
. . . any redeeming virtue,"" North Pacific Railway Co. v. United States, 356 U.S. 1, 5, 78 S. Ct. 514, 518, 2 L. Ed. 2d 545 (1958), 
that they are conclusively presumed to be unreasonable, Broadcast Music, Inc. v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 441 U.S. 
1, 8, 99 S. Ct. 1551, 1557, 60 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1979). Horizontal price-fixing and group boycotts—the two alleged violations here—
often, if not always, fall into this category of ""per se"" violations. In light of our disposition, we need not address Geico's argument 
that the per se analysis should not apply to the context of insurance companies reimbursing their insureds for the companies' 
obligation to pay a body shop for vehicle repairs. "
1338,13," In the briefing instructions for the en banc briefs, the Body Shops were instructed to ""identify the allegations [of the complaints] 
from which such an agreement or conspiracy can plausibly be inferred and discuss whether any asserted inference of 
agreement or conspiracy is 'just as much in line with a wide swath of rational competitive business strategy prompted by 
common perceptions of the market . . . or whether such inference is supported by allegations tending to rule out the possibility 
that the defendants were acting independently.'"" Reluctantly, we cannot conclude that the en banc brief of the Body Shops 
complied with that directive. Although their brief lists numerous statements that it asserts are ""specific allegations of conduct that 
probably do not result from . . . independent responses to common stimuli,"" many have no tendency to suggest an advance 
agreement among the insurance companies, and are thus simply irrelevant. As indicated in this opinion, others reflect facts that 
are simply not pled in the complaints and not reasonably inferred from the actual allegations. We also discuss in this opinion 
those allegations with respect to actions just as much in line with a wide swath of rational competitive business strategy and thus 
cannot qualify as the plus factors required for a viable claim."
1338,14," Two can be rejected outright. The Body Shops argue that they asserted ""specific allegations of conduct that indicate the sort of 
restricted freedom of action and sense of obligation that one generally associates with agreement."" However, despite arguing in 
their brief that representatives from non-State Farm Defendants have stated that they are restricted from altering the purported 
market rate unless authorized by State Farm, that allegation is nowhere to be found in the complaints. Quite the contrary, the 
only relevant specific allegation of fact is that the non-State Farm Insurance Companies advise the Plaintiffs that they will pay no 
more than State Farm pays—i.e., mere price leadership as discussed below. The Body Shops also argue that the conspiracy is shown by the presence of a common motive, namely desire to maximize 
profits. However, under this logic, most businesses with similar pricing would be deemed in cahoots with each other because 
that is the goal of most corporations. This plus factor is more properly invoked in contexts where the motive is unique and 
specific to the alleged conspirators. See, e.g., Instructional Sys. Dev. Corp. v. Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 817 F.2d 639, 647 (10th "
1339,," Cir. 1987) (company exerted influence on municipality in favor of monopolist as part of agreement to avoid monopolist 
challenging it in another market); see also Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law ¶ 1434c, at 276-77 (4th ed. 
2017), ¶ 1434c, at 276-77 (discussing how motivation can, in some cases, merely restate interdependence)."
1339,15," In considering each plus factor, we are cognizant of the Supreme Court's admonition that antitrust plaintiffs receive ""the full 
benefit of their proof without tightly compartmentalizing the various factual components and wiping the slate clean after scrutiny 
of each."" Cont'l Ore Co. v. Union Carbide & Carbon Corp., 370 U.S. 690, 699, 82 S. Ct. 1404, 1410, 8 L. Ed. 2d 777 (1962). At 
the same time, it is undoubtedly our responsibility ""to evaluate the evidence proffered by the plaintiffs not to ascertain its 
credibility, but instead to determine whether that evidence, if credited, 'tends to' establish a conspiracy more than it indicates 
conscious parallelism."" Williamson Oil, 346 F.3d at 1301."
1339,16," Both Twombly and the Appellants quote from earlier editions of Areeda and Hovenkamp's Antitrust Law. However, we use 
the fourth edition of that treatise. "
1340,17, Hereinafter cited as Areeda and Hovenkamp. 
1341,18," As for what else can be said about that allegation, the fact that the Body Shops concede that some of the alleged actions 
occurred ""independently"" is certainly noteworthy. And the allegation of concerted action is merely conclusory. "
1342,19," As noted above, there are no actual allegations that the Insurance Companies use identical language conveying their 
instructions to body shops to use recycled parts, etc., nor any other actual allegation of fact suggesting that some uniform 
practice is somehow idiosyncratic so as to give rise to an inference of advance agreement. "
1343,20," By coincidence, the Illinois Body Shop in this Seventh Circuit case has a name very similar to that of the New Jersey Quality 
Auto Shop in the instant case. "
1344,21," Although the Body Shops assert in their brief that the Insurance Companies share with each other the identity of problem body 
shops and other information, the actual complaints make no such allegations."
1344,22," To the extent that the Body Shops point to their statement in the complaint that ""members of the insurance industry meet 
regularly to discuss such matters in and amongst themselves,"" Compl. ¶ 115, this statement is so vague as to be useless as 
support for a conspiracy. The Supreme Court in Twombly advised that plaintiffs' pleading of meetings between defendants 
needs to provide some degree of detail about the meetings in order to satisfy Rule 8's notice requirements. 550 U.S. at 565 
n.10, 127 S. Ct. at 1970 n.10. The Court faulted the plaintiff in Twombly for not providing any details about when, where or with 
whom in particular the meetings took place. Id.; [**53]  see also id. at 567 n.12, 127 S. Ct. at 1971 n.12 (suggesting that 
membership in a trade association is not significant). Referring to Twombly and its footnote 10, Areeda and Hovenkamp opine: 
""In sum, a conceded 'opportunity' to conspire was completely insufficient absent additional allegations about when and where 
such opportunity occurred, and about which of the defendants' employees participated."" Areeda & Hovenkamp, supra, ¶ 1417b. 
Indeed, the treatise concludes: Even if ""opportunity"" were defined narrowly and limited to proven interfirm contacts, deeming opportunity to be prima facie 
proof of conspiracy would lead to widespread condemnation of procompetitive collaborations. Once competitors assemble 
for a lawful activity, they would be presumptive conspirators . . . on every parallel action subsequently occurring. Because 
parallel pricing is common even in competitive markets, juries would be entitled to infer that competitors had agreed on 
prices, and price agreements are condemned absolutely. Thus, the effect of holding opportunity sufficient would be to 
discourage all trade associations, industry gatherings, or joint ventures. Thereby to imperil reasonable and procompetitive 
collaborations would be inconsistent both with the purposes of the antitrust laws and with well-established Supreme Court 
permission for many kinds of collaboration among competitors. Mere conspiratorial opportunity is routinely and correctly 
held insufficient to support a conspiracy finding. Id. Accord Almanza v. United Airlines, Inc., 851 F.3d 1060, 1071 (11th Cir. 2017) (applying the Twombly standard, and holding 
""Defendants' participation in trade associations . . . do not show a meeting of the minds""); Am. Dental Ass'n v. Cigna Corp., 605 
F.3d 1283, 1295 (11th Cir. 2010) (""[I]t was well-settled before Twombly that participation in trade organizations provides no 
indication of conspiracy""). "

Equity Mortg., Inc., 447 S.W.3d 194, 199 (Mo. 2014) (""An unjust enrichment claim requires a showing that: (1) the plaintiff

A.2d 519, 526 (N.J. 1994) (""To establish unjust enrichment, a plaintiff must show both that defendant received a benefit and that 
retention of that benefit without payment would be unjust.""); Schmidt v. Household Fin. Corp., II, 276 Va. 108, 661 S.E.2d 834, 
838 (Va. 2008) (""To state a cause of action for unjust enrichment, [a plaintiff has] to allege that: (1) he conferred a benefit on [the 
defendant]; (2) [defendant] knew of the benefit and should reasonably have expected to repay [plaintiff]; and (3) [defendant] 
accepted or retained the benefit without paying for its value.""). Although the Virginia rule statement does not expressly require 
that retention of the benefit be unjust, such a requirement is routinely read into the elements by Virginia courts. See, e.g., R.M. 
Harrison Mech. Corp. v. Decker Indus., Inc., 75 Va. Cir. 404, 2008 WL 10669311, at *3 (2008) (""The circumstances of the 
acceptance or retention of the benefit must render it inequitable for the defendant not to compensate the plaintiff.""). "

1348,28," We note that, in a report and recommendation adopted by the district judge in dismissing another complaint in this multidistrict 
litigation, the magistrate judge concluded that the allegations adequately alleged the elements of Tennessee tortious 
interference and did state a plausible claim if taken as true, but determined that the complaint ""suffer[ed] from a different 
problem""—i.e., the group pleading issue. Brewer Body Shop v. State Farm Mut. Ins. Co., 101 F. Supp. 3d 1256, 1265-66 
(M.D. Fla. 2015). We take and mean to imply no position on the correctness of that plausibility holding. We mention it only to 
observe that the magistrate judge seems to have considered the group pleading ""problem"" as a separate matter from a run-of-
the-mill Twombly-Iqbal analysis."

1349,32," We note that declining to exercise pendent jurisdiction is only one of the various options available to the district court on 
remand. We emphasize that we vacate the judgment of the district court with respect to the tortious interference claims only on 
the above described basis—i.e., our rejection of the narrow theory of group pleading upon which the district court relied. We 
decline to address other possible theories on the basis of which that judgment might have been affirmed (whether on the basis 
of the merits or other pleading deficiencies, including even other possible group pleading theories). "
1350,1," See generally Herbert Hovenkamp, Whatever Did Happen to the Antitrust Movement?, 94 Notre Dame L. Rev. 583, 628-36 
(2018)."
1350,2," Relatedly, Twombly instructs us to resist reasoning backwards from our own version of the facts or knowledge of the industry at 
issue. See Maj. Op. at 5 (citing Alfred M. Thomas & Michael Jund, Collision Repair and Refinishing: A Foundation Course for 
Technicians 7 (2014)); Maj. Op. at 22 (""[T]he 'products' here—cars—are so readily assembled from standard parts that their 
assembly line manufacturing set the standard for other industries.""); Maj. Op. at 27 (noting that for the auto insurance industry, 
""parts and labor reimbursements are the primary business expenditures""). Imagine the already difficult job of a district court 
analyzing an antitrust complaint if that was Twombly's directive: not just to analyze the facts alleged in the complaint in front of it, 
but to embark on its own independent fact-finding mission to determine whether other facts might exist that discredit those we 
must accept as true."
1350,3," The majority correctly concludes that the group boycott allegations are too conclusory to state a claim. I dissent only on the 
price-fixing claim. See Maj. Op. at Part IV (B). "
1351,4," Infracompetitive means below the competitive level—that is, a price below marginal cost."
1351,5," Because the auto body shops allege a per se illegal agreement among the auto body insurers to fix prices, they are not 
required adequately to allege anticompetitive harm. Even so, the anticompetitive effects of monopsony power are well-
documented, both in the context of horizontal cartel agreements and horizontal mergers. See, e.g., Todd v. Exxon Corp., 275 
F.3d 191 (2d Cir. 2001) (Sotomayor, J.) (holding employees' allegations of information exchanges and oligopsonistic market 
sufficient to state claim of wage suppression conspiracy); Law v. Nat'l Collegiate Athletic Ass'n, 134 F.3d 1010 (10th Cir. 1998) 
(condemning agreement among colleges to limit salaries of basketball coaches); United States v. Anthem, Inc., 855 F.3d 345, 
378, 428 U.S. App. D.C. 403 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting) (disagreeing on the availability of efficiency defense to "
1352,," merger of two health insurers but recognizing that if the merged insurer ""would obtain provider rates that are below competitive 
levels because of its exercise of unlawful monopsony power against providers, that could be a problem, and perhaps a fatal one 
for this merger""); W. Penn Allegheny Health Sys., Inc. v. UPMC, 627 F.3d 85 (3d Cir. 2010) (sustaining complaint that hospital 
system and health insurer conspired to suppress reimbursement rates paid to healthcare providers)."
1352,6," Given the majority's extensive reliance on Twombly's antitrust holding, it is worth noting how the antitrust allegations here are 
unlike those in Twombly. The complaint in Twombly alleged that four dominant telephone companies agreed not to compete by 
dividing the market into exclusive selling territories. Twombly, 550 U.S. at 551. The totality of the allegations to support an 
agreement were that: the four phone companies did not expand into one another's territories, each defendant excluded other 
companies from their respective territories, and the CEO of one of the telephone companies had once stated that expanding to 
its rivals' territories ""might be a good way to turn a quick dollar but that doesn't make it right."" Id. at 550. ""[P]rice fixing is a very 
different practice, producing different kinds of signals, from the market division scheme alleged in Twombly. Most importantly, 
parallel lockstep pricing requires interdependence, while simultaneous failure to enter one another's markets creates no such 
inference . . . . By contrast, the Twombly complaint, which alleged little more than a parallel failure to enter one another's 
markets, did no more than describe behavior that was equally consistent with collusion and competition."" Areeda & Hovenkamp, 
supra, ¶ 1434c2. "
1353,7," In discussing uniformity of tactics, the majority notes: ""Not only is there no allegation of identical or similar language, the 
language actually used in the complaints suggests just the opposite. As noted, ¶ 63 alleges '[t]hrough various means' and ¶ 64 
alleges '[s]ome of these methods'—i.e. phrases that do not suggest that all or a substantial group of the Insurance Companies 
engage in all or most of the methods in strikingly similar ways."" Maj. Op. at 26. That portion of the complaint says: ""Through 
various methods, the Defendants have, independently and in concert, instituted numerous methods of coercing the Plaintiff into 
accepting less than actual and/or market costs for materials and supplies,"" and then the next paragraph lists ""[s]ome of these 
methods."" Compl. ¶¶ 63, 64. These two sections could reasonably be read to mean the Defendants have all instituted various 
methods of coercing the body shops—rather than the majority's reading that each of the Defendants instituted varying methods. 
While far from an object of clarity, if we view this section as a whole, the majority's reading is implausible. This paragraph begins 
the section titled ""Suppression of Repair and Material Costs."" The rest of the section describes the ""various methods,"" and 
clarifies that ""the Defendants"" engage in those methods. See, e.g., Compl. ¶ 65 (""In addition to the above, the Defendants have 
repeatedly and intentionally failed to abide by industry standards for auto repairs.""); Compl. ¶ 67 (noting that ""the Defendants will 
refuse to allow the body shop to perform required procedures and processes""); Compl. ¶ 68 (""A non-exhaustive list of 
procedures and processes the Defendants refuse to pay and/or pay in full is attached hereto as Exhibit '3.'""). ""As we have 
explained, a court reviewing a motion to dismiss must draw all reasonable inferences from the factual allegations in a plaintiff's 
complaint in the plaintiff's favor."" Bailey v. Wheeler, 843 F.3d 473, 482 (11th Cir. 2016)."
1353,8," The majority finds it significant that this case does not contain the precise market factors that made convergent pricing suspect 
in prior cases—the ""secret,"" ""sealed,"" and ""simultaneous"" bids that suggested the identical prices in FTC v. Cement Inst., 333 
U.S. 683, 713, 68 S. Ct. 793, 92 L. Ed. 1010, 44 F.T.C. 1460 (1948), were the product of collusion. See Maj. Op. at 18-23. While 
the Supreme Court used these factors to show the dubious provenance of the prices in Cement Institute, they certainly are not 
the only way—or, in the seventy years since the Supreme Court's decision in that case, the typical way— to do so. But see Maj. "
1354,," Op. at 19 (""[T]he Body Shops quote a leading antitrust treatise for the idea that an agreement may be present if rivals establish 
identical prices, but they fail to grapple with the caveat that this is only true where there are 'simultaneous identical bids on a 
made-toorder product not readily assembled from standard and conventionally priced items.'"" (emphasis added) (quoting Areeda 
& Hovenkamp, supra, ¶ 1434b)). Just after the portion quoted by the majority, the same treatise gives a host of other examples 
that may amount to ""parallelism that is too close for coincidence and beyond explanation by mere recognized interdependence"" 
including ""conspiratorial opportunity, unexplained meetings, furtive behavior, discussions and information exchanges, ambiguous 
participant admissions, solicitations of agreement, sham bids, threats of common action directed against a potential victim, 
identical bids, refusals to bid, proved conspiracy or competition in other markets or times."" Areeda & Hovenkamp, supra, ¶ 
1434b. The allegations here make other cases better analogues. See, e.g., In re Text Messaging Antitrust Litig., 630 F.3d 622 
(7th Cir. 2010)."
1354,9," See Compl. ¶ 61 (""net effect of this tactic is to allow State Farm to manipulate the 'market rate' and artificially suppress the 
labor rate""; Compl. ¶ 62 (""These Defendants have agreed to join forces with State Farm, the dominant market holder, and each 
other to coerce the Plaintiff into accepting the artificially created less-than-market labor rates""; Compl. ¶ 63 (""Defendants have, 
independently and in concert, instituted numerous methods of coercing the plaintiff into accepting less than actual and/or market 
costs for materials and supplies""); Compl. ¶ 64 (""requiring discounts and/or concessions, even when doing so requires the shop 
to operate at a loss""); Compl. ¶ 71 (Defendants universally used formula for reimbursing paint repairs ""which compensates the 
shops for only half the actual cost on average""). "
1355,10," To argue that the identical prices here are not cause for concern, the majority cites the Seventh Circuit's decision in Quality 
Auto Body, Inc. v. Allstate Insurance Co., 660 F.2d 1195 (7th Cir. 1981). Quality Auto Body was an appeal from the grant of 
summary judgment for the insurers. The plaintiff body shop conducted significant discovery, including each insurer's rates, 
depositions of their executives, and the results of State Farm's surveys. See Quality Auto Body, 660 F.2d at 1200 (""The 
uncontroverted affidavits and deposition testimony submitted by defendants establish that each company has unilaterally 
developed its own claim-handling procedures.""). The Seventh Circuit found that, contrary to the plaintiff's complaint, the 
evidence after discovery revealed that the labor rates used by the insurers were variable and that each insurer ""uses a different 
method for determining the lowest prevailing competitive rate."" Id. The complaint that apparently warranted discovery merely 
alleged that the insurers followed a ""common formula"" for calculating rates. Id. Similarly, in the other case the majority cites for 
this proposition, Proctor v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., 675 F.2d 308, 316, 218 U.S. App. D.C. 289 (D.C. Cir. 
1982), the D.C. Circuit similarly reviewed an order granting summary judgment. Noting this important distinction, the court 
reasoned that ""[i]n considering whether to grant summary judgment in this case the District Court relied . . . on the length of time 
. . . and the ample opportunities for discovery that the appellants had to 'unearth evidence to support their allegations."" Proctor, 
675 F.2d at 316 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). The results of discovery—all the body shops here seek—from a 
pair of cases in the 1980s can hardly undercut the allegations we must accept as true at the motion to dismiss stage. And if the 
body shops here are similarly unsuccessful at uncovering evidence of a conspiracy during discovery, they too would lose at 
summary judgment. "
1356,11," The majority's assertion that ""the complaints make no factual allegations that the Insurance Companies . . . declined to pay for 
the same repairs"" is simply not true. See Compl. ¶ 68 (""A non-exhaustive list of procedures and processes the Defendants 
refuse to pay and/or pay in full is attached hereto as Exhibit '3.'""); Exhibit 3 (listing repairs); Compl. ¶ 67 (""In many instances, the 
Defendants will refuse to allow the body shop to perform required procedures and processes, thereby requiring body shops to 
perform less-than-quality work or suffer a financial loss on a given repair."")."
1356,12," Compl. ¶ 74 (State Farm ""assured those present, and the Department of Insurance representative that it would begin abiding 
by those database estimates and stated it would raise the matter at its insurance industry meetings, held locally approximately 
once a month""); Compl. ¶ 75 (""The [auto body shop] association representative present for the meeting, John Mosley, invited 
State Farm to attend those [auto body shop] Association meetings if State Farm would permit members of the Association to 
attend the insurance meetings. Mr. Simpkins [the State Farm representative] refused.""). The majority opinion ignores these 
allegations, instead pointing to the summary paragraph that notes ""members of the insurance industry meet regularly to discuss 
such matters in and amongst themselves."" Compl. ¶ 115. The majority, disregarding the other related allegations—and thus 
failing to follow Twombly's directive to view the complaint as a whole—argues that ""this statement is so vague as to be useless 
as support for a conspiracy."" Maj. Op. at 33 n.22. "
1357,," The complaint does not specifically allege whether other defendants attend the ""insurance industry meetings"" in question. We do 
know that ""the Insurance Companies account for sixty-five to eighty-five percent of the insurance market in each of the relevant 
states."" Maj. Op. at 6. It is a reasonable inference that at least some participate in ""insurance industry meetings."" But regardless, 
State Farm's admission is important because it suggests State Farm seeks approval from other insurance industry members on 
its rate setting mechanism. That admission—made in front of several witnesses—alone suggests the rate that the insurers 
uniformly follow is not derived independently by State Farm with the other insurers simply following its lead. See Compl. ¶ 114 
(referring to the ""concert of action among the Defendants and co-conspirators to control and suppress automobile damage repair 
costs""); Compl. ¶ 115 (""Evidence of this conspiracy or combination includes, but is not limited to, admission before witnesses 
that members of the insurance industry meet regularly to discuss such matters in and amongst themselves""). "
1358,13," For example, the lead complaint lists the headquarters of ""GEICO Casualty Company,"" ""Government Employees Insurance 
Company,"" and ""GEICO Indemnity Company"" as the same address in Chevy Chase, Maryland. Compl. ¶¶ 9-11. "

1388,8," After the Court had entered summary judgment on market definition, Defendants argued that the Court should have considered 
or adopted an alternative market definition that their economics expert, Dr. Kenneth Elzinga, discussed in his report, namely a 
""multi-sided market for college education in the United States' in which colleges operate as multi-sided platforms that balance 
their pricing to numerous constituencies. Elzinga Report at 26-28; see also Order Reaffirming Exclusion of Certain Expert 
Testimony by Dr. Elzinga at 9, Docket No. 1018. The Court rejected this argument on the ground that it was untimely, because 
Defendants did not offer any alternative definition of the relevant market or point to any admissible evidence to raise a genuine 
issue of material fact with respect to market definition during summary judgment proceedings; and on the ground that Dr. 
Elzinga's expert opinions about a multi-sided relevant market were unreliable and inadmissible. See generally id. "

1390,10," This Court issued its O'Bannon I injunction on August 8, 2014, to take effect on August 1, 2015. Case No. 09-cv-3329, Docket 
Nos. 292, 298. On July 31, 2015, the Ninth Circuit stayed the injunction. Case No. 09-cv-3329, Docket No. 418. On September 
30, 2015, while the injunction was stayed, the Ninth Circuit issued its opinion affirming in part this Court's decision; the judgment 
became effective on December 28, 2015, when the Ninth Circuit issued its mandate. See O'Bannon II, 802 F.3d at 1079; Case 
No. 09-CV-3329, Docket Nos. 437, 463. Thus, the Autonomy structure change to the full grant-in-aid limit became effective 
before the injunctive relief ordered by this Court in O'Bannon I ever went into effect. The Autonomy structure change differs from 
the relief ordered in O'Bannon; it permits grants-in-aid up to the cost of attendance for any Division I athlete (in any sport) and is 
not limited to compensation for the use or licensing of NIL. By contrast, the relief ordered in O'Bannon I, in relevant part, 
prohibited the NCAA from precluding its members from compensating Division I men's basketball and FBS football student-
athletes for the licensing or use of their NIL, at an amount lower than the cost of attendance. Compare Division I Bylaw 15.02.6 
""Full Grant-in-Aid"" with Case No. 09-cv-3329, Docket No. 292 (injunction)."
1390,11," See, e.g., Trial Tr. (Lennon) at 1618 (the Power Five's ability to modify athletics financial aid caps is limited by NCAA Bylaw

1390,12," Two additional pro-competitive justifications had been offered previously: increased output and competitive balance. These 
were rejected by the Court on summary judgment. They also were rejected in O'Bannon I and the NCAA did not address them

provided in the form of ""gift suites,"" which involve allowing student-athletes access to a location where they can select from a 
variety of gifts. See Elzinga Direct Testimony Declaration ¶ 95. Gifts available through gift suites include prepaid debit cards 
from stores such as Best Buy, iPad minis, speakers, watches, and headphones. See, e.g., James Dep. Tr. at 168 (received a

1392,15," The Division I Bylaws address only the uses of SAF monies that are impermissible. Neither schools nor conferences report to 
the NCAA detailed information (i.e., by student-athlete or by expense) to show how SAF funds were allocated; conferences 
report to the NCAA only amounts and types of uses of SAF monies in the aggregate. Trial Tr. (Lennon) at 1634-35. SAF monies 
have been used for expenses related to education, including postgraduate scholarships; fees for internship programs; 
international student fees, taxes, and insurance; school supplies and electronics (such as laptops, cameras, tablets); graduate 
school application fees; graduate school exam fees; tutoring; and academic achievement or graduation awards. J0002 at 0010; 
J0020 at 0001; P0043 at 0001; J0019 at 0001. SAF monies also have been used for benefits that are not related to education, 
such as loss-of-value insurance premiums, Trial Tr. (Lennon) at 1340; medical expenses; professional program testing; career 
assessments; travel expenses for both the student-athlete and family members; clothing; magazine subscriptions; and grocery 
reimbursement. J0002 at 0010; J0020 at 0001. AEF monies have been used for education-related benefits, such as academic 
achievement or graduation awards; summer school; fifth-or sixth-year aid; tutoring; academic support services; international 
student fees and taxes; professional program testing; and supplies (expendable or educational). J0021 at 0004-05. They have 
also been used for benefits that are not related to education, such as insurance premiums; medical, dental, or vision expenses 
(not covered by another insurance program); clothing; travel; and capital improvements/equipment. Id.; Stip. Facts ¶ 15, Docket 
No. 1094. "
1393,16," See P0104 (showing SAF payments above the cost of attendance (COA) provided to in-state students at Ohio State 
University, with the highest above-COA payment being $14,740); P0105 (showing SAF payments above COA provided to out-of-
state students at Ohio State University, with the highest above-COA payment being $49,015); P0106 (showing SAF payments 
above COA at nineteen schools, with the highest above-COA payment being $61,000); Rascher Direct Testimony Declaration ¶¶ 
75, 78-81; Trial Tr. (Lennon) at 1338-40; Trial Tr. (Rascher) at 111."
1393,17," Division I Bylaw 15.1.1. Pell grants are awarded by the government based on financial need measured by the difference 
between a student's ability to pay and the cost of attendance. The maximum amount of a Pell grant is $6,000. Noll Direct 
Testimony Declaration ¶¶ 78-79. When a student-athlete receives athletics aid permitted by the NCAA in addition to a Pell grant, 
the athletics aid may exceed the student's need as determined by federal regulations. See J1518 at 0001-02. This is an 
exception to the general practice that requires schools to adjust nonfederal aid awards to ensure that the total aid does not 
exceed a student's financial need. Id. "
1394,18," In addition to the changes described in the Background section above, the fact that the NCAA currently permits student-
athletes to receive the other forms of compensation discussed in this section in addition to a full grant-in-aid scholarship, such as "
1395,," compensation ""incidental to athletics participation, including performance awards, also distinguishes today's concept of the 
amateur student-athlete from that in effect in earlier years."
1395,19," Again, this is not intended to suggest that student-athletes should not receive these payments, but that the increases in 
compensation described above have not negatively affected consumer demand. "
1396,20," For example, in 2016, the NCAA extended its agreement with CBS/Turner for the March Madness tournament; the previous 
contract was to run through 2024. The 2016 extension increased substantially the average annual fees owed to the NCAA 
relative to the prior iteration of the contract. D0532 at 0023; Rascher Direct ¶ 47; P0045 at 0001-02. The total value of the 2016 
extension, which covers eight years, from 2024 to 2032, is $8.8 billion. P0045 at 0002. The prior iteration, which covers fourteen 
years, from 2010 to 2024, is valued at $10.8 billion. P0045 at 0001. Additionally, the 2016 extension is through 2032; witnesses 
who have experience negotiating media contracts in the context of college sports have described this as a major extension on 
the ground that contracts of greater potential value to broadcasters are typically executed for a longer timeframe. See Trial Tr. 
(Aresco) at 1009 (characterizing the 2016 extension as a ""major extension""); id. at 998 (in the context of media contracts in 
college sports, ""[t]he more attractive the product, the longer [the networks would] want to go"" with the length of a contract)."
1396,21," Some defense witnesses speculated that networks or sponsors could choose to renegotiate broadcast rights fees under 
provisions for ""changed circumstances"" if they believed that Division I basketball and FBS football changed from amateur to 
professional. See, e.g., NCAA Rule 30(b)(6) witness (Mark Lewis) Dep. Tr. at 247. This testimony, however, is not supported. 
Defendants have not pointed to any instance in which networks or sponsors have chosen to renegotiate licensing rights fees as 
a result of changes in student-athlete compensation or otherwise, and the record shows no renegotiations or fees adjustments 
after the grant-in-aid limit was increased to cost of attendance on August 1, 2015. See, e.g., Big 12 Rule 30(b)(6) witness 
(Robert Bowlsby) Dep. Tr. at 121, 125-28. No evidence was presented that student-athlete compensation or amateurism have 
even been discussed with media partners in this context, suggesting that these issues are not of concern to media partners and 
that renegotiation based on these issues is unlikely. See, e.g., Conference USA Rule 30(b)(6) witness (Judy McLeod) Dep. Tr. 
149-50; Big 12 Rule 30(b)(6) witness (Robert Bowlsby) Dep. Tr. 125-28. "
1397,22," The NCAA offered in O'Bannon a survey by Dr. J. Michael Dennis that did ask respondents about their future behaviors. This 
survey suffered from other defects. See O'Bannon I, 7 F. Supp. 3d at 975-76; O'Bannon II, 802 F.3d at 1059."
1397,23," Moreover, Dr. Isaacson acknowledged that he was ""not providing an opinion on whether or not opposition to a particular 
benefit relates to amateurism. I'm going to leave that to you and the NCAA and the conferences."" See Trial Tr. (Isaacson) at 
1912. "
1398,24," The Court finds that Dr. Poret's survey results and the conclusions he draws therefrom regarding future consumption of 
Division I basketball and FBS football are based on a methodology that is sufficiently reliable. Dr. Poret showed that his use of 
controls and other aspects of his survey's design allowed him to assess reliably the potential impact on future consumer 
behavior of implementing the scenarios he tested. Poret Rebuttal Testimony ¶¶ 12-26; Trial Tr. (Poret) at 1713-16; 1725-26; 
1729; 1781-82; 1784."
1398,25," Some witnesses referred to studies conducted by third parties at the request and for the use of conferences. See Trial Tr. 
(Scott) at 1167, 1153-57; D0541 (third-party study commissioned by the Pac-12, dated January 2014); Trial Tr. (Scott) 1149-53, 
1172; D0683 (third-party study commissioned by the Big Ten, dated September 21, 2009); Trial Tr. (Smith) at 1412-18; D0239 
(third-party study commissioned by the Big Ten, dated June 3, 2008). There is no evidence that these or any other studies were 
considered by the NCAA when enacting any bylaws limiting compensation. These studies were admitted for a limited purpose 
and not for the truth of the matter asserted therein because their contents constitute hearsay within hearsay. "
1399,26," For example, the Ivy League does not offer any athletics-based scholarships. Military academies offer no athletics 
scholarships but pay their students as salaried employees. Some conferences, like the Big 12, require their members to offer 
athletics scholarships up to the maximum allowed by the NCAA. Some schools in other conferences cap athletics-related 
compensation at the cost of attendance (in other words, these schools do not permit students to, for example, receive a full cost-
of-attendance grant-in-aid on top of a Pell grant). Rascher Direct Testimony Declaration ¶¶ 41, 96; Big 12 Handbook J0005 at 
0017."
1399,27," See e.g., Trial Tr. (Aresco) at 1054-55 (disparities in revenue and branding opportunities currently exist between conferences, 
and schools with fewer resources still play schools with greater resources); Bowlsby Dep. Tr. at 38-39 (agreeing that the concept 
of ""competitive equity is largely a mirage"" because ""in reality, there hadn't been much balance in the past""); Slive Dep. Tr. at 39 
(""the effort to ensure a level playing field was an unattainable concept"")."
1399,28," See also Lynn Holzman Dep. Tr. 129-30 (NCAA Vice President for Women's Basketball, testifying that under current NCAA 
rules for March Madness, ""institutions with different resources, institutions that provide athletic scholarships and some that don't 
end up being matched up and play against one another. So if there's an institution that permissibly is providing a benefit or 
something to student-athletes, under the current construct of the championship, an institution that does not provide the same 
thing, in my opinion, would be okay for them to play one another"")."
1399,29," See Trial Tr. (Aresco) at 1025-26 (the ""larger schools"" cannot ""take 200 of the best student athletes"" because ""there are 
scholarship limits, 85 per school. And that was imposed in 1992. And it was to enhance the competition in college football""). "
1400,30," in this context, Defendants also argue that academic integration itself plays a role in preserving consumer demand for college 
sports. This is merely a restatement of the argument that the challenged limits preserve consumer demand because consumers "
1401,," value amateurism. Indeed, the evidence that Defendants offer to support both of these arguments overlaps. The Court considers 
this argument to be part of the consumer demand justification."
1401,31," Dr. Heckman's analysis was based on data whose temporal scope did not capture the class period in this litigation, and did not 
include any information about whether the student-athletes actually received an athletics scholarship (and if so, the amount of 
such scholarship) or any of the other types of compensation that are at issue in this case. "
1406,32," Starting in August 2019, as a result of the findings and recommendations of the Commission on College Basketball chaired by 
Dr. Condoleezza Rice, see P0060, the NCAA will add a body composed of ""both external investigators with no school or 
conference affiliations and select NCAA enforcement staff"" to adjudicate independently cases involving potential violations of 
NCAA rules that are deemed ""complex."" Stip. Facts ¶ 9, Docket No. 1098 (internal quotation marks omitted). Examples of 
complex cases include alleged violations of core NCAA values such as prioritizing academics and the well-being of college 
athletes. Id. The perceived need for this new enforcement mechanism is unrelated to the changes mandated here, but this 
mechanism could certainly be used to police them."
1406,33," The NCAA requires all of its members to comply with and enforce its rules. See, e.g., Division I Constitution Article 1.3.2 
(requiring member institutions to ""apply and enforce"" NCAA legislation about eligibility, financial aid, and recruiting, among other 
matters); Division I Constitution Article 2.1 (requiring member schools to maintain ""institutional control"")."
1406,34," For example, Larry Scott testified that in the absence of NCAA compensation limits, there would be ""significant additional 
infrastructure and expense"" at the Pac-12 relating to ""rule development."" Trial Tr. (Scott) at 1136-37. But other evidence shows 
that the Pac-12 already has a system in place for passing and amending bylaws relating to student-athlete financial aid and 
otherwise. See Pac-12 Handbook, J0010 at 0008, 0014, 0015, 0017-18."
1406,35," Defendants contend in their opening statement that adopting any of Plaintiffs' proposed alternatives would result in conference 
realignment, which would entail increased costs. As discussed above, conference realignment is common and the evidence 
does not support a finding that adopting the third alternative would result in conference realignment. "
1408,36," Res judicata prohibits the re-litigation of any claims that were raised or could have been raised in a prior action. Tahoe-Sierra 
Pres. Council, Inc. v. Tahoe Reg'l Planning Agency, 322 F.3d 1064, 1077-78 (9th Cir. 2003). Three elements must be present for 
res judicata to apply: (1) an identity of claims; (2) a final judgment on the merits; and (3) the same parties or their privies. Id. at 
1077."
1408,37," Collateral estoppel ""prevents a party from relitigating an issue decided in a previous action if four requirements are met: '(1) 
there was a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the previous action; (2) the issue was actually litigated in that action; 
(3) the issue was lost as a result of a final judgment in that action; and (4) the person against whom collateral estoppel is 
asserted in the present action was a party or in privity with a party in the previous action.'"" Kendall v. Visa U.S.A., Inc., 518 F.3d 
1042, 1050 (9th Cir. 2008) (citation omitted)."
1408,38," See Costantini v. Trans World Airlines, 681 F.2d 1199, 1201-02 (9th Cir. 1982) (citation omitted) (holding that a single cause 
of action for the purpose of applying res judicata exists in successive lawsuits, if, among other things, both actions ""involve 
infringement of the same right,"" and ""substantially the same evidence"" was presented in both actions); Cent. Delta Water 
Agency v. United States, 306 F.3d 938, 953 (9th Cir. 2002) (holding that collateral estoppel cannot be applied where the facts of 
the prior action are merely ""similar"" to the ones in the second case) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). "
1409,39," See O'Bannon I, Case No. 09-cv-3329, Pls.' Trial Brief at 4, Docket No. 172 (listing challenged rules); Case No. 09-cv-1967, 
Third Am. Consolidated Complaint $359, Docket No. 832 (same)."
1409,40," For example, challenged rules that are common to both cases include Division I Bylaw 13.2.1 (prohibiting benefits and 
financial aid not permitted by the NCAA); Division I Bylaw 16.02.5 (prohibiting funds, awards, or benefits not permitted by the 
NCAA); and Division I Bylaw 12.1.2.1 (listing prohibited forms of ""pay""). These rules must be read in conjunction with rules that 
address compensation and benefits in more specific terms and in more specific contexts. "
1412,41," The Court will not consider arguments relating to procompetitive justifications that it rejected on summary judgment. See 
Summary Judgment Order at 23 n.7, Docket No. 804; see also O'Bannon II 802 F.3d at 1072 (affirming the district court's 
rejection of competitive balance and increased output procompetitive justifications because the NCAA ""offered no meaningful 
argument that those findings were clearly erroneous""). "
1415,42," For example, when asked whether increasing the current limit on Senior Scholar Awards from two students per school to five 
students per school would render the awards inconsistent with amateurism, the NCAA's Rule 30(b)(6) witness, Kevin Lennon, 
provided no meaningful response other than to justify the current limit on the basis that the membership decided that limiting the 
awards to two students per school constituted a reasonable cap. Trial Tr. (Lennon) at 1551-53. It could be raised from two to 
three. Lennon Rule 30(b)(6) Dep. Tr. at 179. "
1416,43," Because Defendants have not shown that the challenged rules can be justified on the ground that they promote integration, 
the Court does not consider whether any proffered less restrictive alternatives would promote integration. "
1417,44," As discussed in the findings of fact, the athletics participation awards limit is the maximum amount of compensation that an 
individual student-athlete could receive in an academic school year in participation, championship, or special achievement 
awards (combined) under Division I Bylaw, Article 16, and listed in Figures 16-1, 16-2, and 16-3 of the 2018-2019 Division I 
Manual, J0024. "

would make the ultimate decision of which product to specify for use in a particular project."" Id. at 133. Both the market and the 
challenged conduct were significantly different than here. The parties here agree as to the ultimate decision made by the 
contractor. They dispute the architect's dispositive role. In Santana, the plaintiff challenged the defendant's marketing statements 
to customers. We are not addressing marketing statements. The parties in Santana sold toilet partitions. We have disputed 
evidence as to the role of architects. We cannot simply transfer the realities of one market to another. Each market requires a

1466,2, Id. § 14. 
1476,1, The ECF numbers cited to herein refer to the main consolidated docket: 16-md-2687.
1476,2," For purposes of brevity, the Court will cite only to the Charleston Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint whenever the Akron, 
Greenville, and/or Spartanburg Complaints allege similar facts. Hence, this background is generally derived from Charleston 
Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint (""FAC""), which was docketed on the consolidated docket, 16-md-2687. (ECF No. 839). The Court 
must accept the allegations therein as true at this stage of the proceedings. See Alston V. Countrywide Fin. Corp., 585 F.3d 753, 
758 (3d Cir. 2009). "
1477,3," Akron does not bring state law claims. (Civ. No. 18-9781, ECF No. 1 (""Akron Compl."")). "
1478,4, This is the only count Akron asserts in its Complaint.
1478,5, This claim is not being brought by the Spartanburg Plaintiffs. 
1479,6," Plaintiffs are not asserting general jurisdiction, so the Court will not go into detail regarding that legal standard. "
1480,7," The Court need not analyze service of process and venue, as USALCO waived service of process, (ECF No. 804), and it does 
not challenge venue."
1480,8," USALCO also moves in the alternative for a more definite statement concerning the pleading of certain facts related to the 
Court's personal jurisdiction analysis. (ECF No. 1143-2 at 12-14). As the Court finds that the South Carolina Plaintiffs have 
established personal jurisdiction without relying on those facts, USALCO's motion for a more definite statement is denied as 
moot. "
1481,9," It also argues that the Charleston Plaintiffs and Greenville's state antitrust claims are time-barred under that statute's three-year 
statute of limitations. (ECF No. 1116-1 at 13-14). For the same reasons that this Court finds that the Charleston Plaintiffs and 
Greenville's federal antitrust claims are not time-barred, their state antitrust claims are not time-barred. "
1482,10," The City of Spartanburg brings its state antitrust claims under the antitrust laws of North Carolina. The Delta Defendants admit 
that this analysis is substantially the same as the federal antitrust analysis. (ECF No. 1146-1 at 31). "
1483,11," It should be noted that the absence of a contract is not fatal to an unjust enrichment claim; on the contrary, it is a requirement. 
Swanson v. Stratos, 350 S.C. 116, 564 S.E.2d 117, 120 (S.C. Ct. App. 2002). "
1484,12," The Delta Defendants also argue that for the South Carolina Plaintiffs to proceed on their unjust enrichment claim against 
John Besson, they must pierce the corporate veil. (ECF No. 1144-1 at 33-34). However, the cases cited by the Delta Defendants 
do not establish that this is the law of South Carolina. The Court declines to weigh in on what appears to be unsettled state law, 
particularly in light of the fact that it has already allowed unjust enrichment claims to proceed against John Besson based on 
nearly identical allegations, (ECF No. 1030 at 15)."
1484,1, The ECF numbers cited to herein refer to the main consolidated docket: 16-md-2687. 
1490,1," On November 20, 2018, the Court resolved a motion to dismiss the later-filed complaint of a third ""platform"" (i.e., non-class) 
plaintiff, trueEX LLC. See In re Interest Rate Swaps Antitrust Litig., 351 F. Supp. 3d 698, 2018 WL 6067325 (S.D.N.Y. 2018). 
That decision, which sustained trueEX's claims in principal part, is not germane to the present motion. "
1491,2," Docket references here are to 16-MD-2704, which embraces all filings in this case, not to the ""master case"" docket, 16-MC-
2704, established for filings of significance. "
1493,3," The Court notes that there are differences between the unredacted hard copy of the PFAC sent to the Court as a courtesy copy 
and the electronic version emailed to the Court on October 25, 2018 with plaintiffs' request to file it under seal. The differences 
include divergent paragraph numbering. The Court cites here to the paragraph numbers of the electronic version. "
1498,4," On the Court's review, the PFAC cites just one pre-Dodd-Frank document reflecting any extant buy-side IRS clearing: a 
December 17, 2009 press release entitled ""LCH.Clearnet Launches Buy-side Clearing for Global OTC Interest Rate Swaps."" 
Playforth Decl. Ex. 14 at 1; see PFAC ¶ 442 & n.512 (citing same). Class plaintiffs have previously stated that ""there was no 
investor clearing of IRS trades before Dodd-Frank."" Dkt. 193 (class plaintiffs' consolidated opposition to defendants' motion to 
dismiss the SAC) at 45. The press release adds: ""The extension of this proven service to customers of banks reflects a key pillar 
of the market changes being contemplated by regulators and legislators worldwide."" Playforth Decl. Ex. 14 at I."
1498,5," For avoidance of doubt, the Court would still hold that plaintiffs' claimed injury for 2008-2012 is too speculative to support 
antitrust standing even had it not considered these regulatory materials. Neither party here argues that the Court's notice of the 
fact of regulatory events is improper. See Pl. Mem. at 20 n.74 (disputing defendants' characterization of CFTC comments); Def. 
Mem. at 14 n.9 (citing cases in support of the Court taking judicial notice of CFTC filings); Pl. Reply at 12 & n. 12 (disputing 
defendants' characterization of CFTC rules)."
1498,6," Buy-side comment letters were to the same effect. See, e.g., Managed Funds Ass'n, Comment Letter on Proposed Clearing 
and Execution Implementation Rule, 76 Fed. Reg. 58,186, and Proposed Documentation and Margining Implementation Rule, 
76 Fed. Reg. 58,176, at 2 (Nov. 4, 2011) (recognizing ""current structural and economic barriers to widespread clearing [of

2011) (""[E]stablishing clearing arrangements is resource-intensive"")). "
1503,7," Consistent with this, defendants note that documents cited in the PFAC reflect that after the Dealers' investment per ""Project 
Fusion,"" Tradeweb's trading volume in IRSs, credit default swaps, and several other asset classes grew substantially from a de 
minimis base. See Def. Mem. at 28 & n.20 (quoting documents cited by the PFAC reflecting that Tradeweb IRS revenue grew 
from approximately $1.9 million in 2006 to approximately $21 million in 2009); cf id. at 28 (quoting documents cited by the PFAC 
that articulate ""Project Fusion"" participants' purposes for investing as including launching ""the first global trading network to offer 
clients the ability to trade any asset class in any currency on one platform 24 hours a day""). The PFAC contains allegations 
about post-""Project Fusion"" business decisions by Tradeweb, for example, delaying the launch date of ""click to trade"" 
functionality, see PFAC ¶¶ 158, 181-87, or as to the direction of the later Dealerweb platform, see id. ¶¶ 188-95. The parties 
debate whether these later events bear on whether the ""Project Fusion"" joint venture was per se illegal. Compare Def. Mem. at 
29-30 & n.22 with Pl. Reply at 19 & nn.34-35. The Court treats the PFAC as alleging that the joint venture, from its inception, 
was per se illegal, and that ensuing decisions by Tradeweb, given its control by Dealers, shed light on the motives of the Dealer 
participants in that venture. As noted, however, the pled facts, in totality, do not permit the venture to be condemned per se."
1503,8," For many of the same reasons, ""quick look"" analysis is unavailable here. It does not apply to collaborations among competitors 
that ""'might plausibly be thought to have a net procompetitive effect, or possibly no effect at all on competition.'"" Major League 
Baseball Props., Inc. v. Salvino, Inc., 542 F.3d 290, 318 (2d Cir. 2008) (quoting Cal. Dental Ass 'n v. FTC, 526 U.S. 756, 771, 
119 S. Ct. 1604, 143 L. Ed. 2d 935 (1999). "
1505,9," Apart from the fact that the ""Project Snowflake"" and ""Trad-X"" joint ventures do not resemble any of the species of 
arrangements among horizontal competitors that courts have condemned per se, defendants note a number of other problematic 
features of plaintiffs' claims of a Dealer conspiracy along the lines alleged. See Def. Mem. at 44-47. An example as to ICAP: In 
conflict with the PFAC's assertion that ICAP has ""restricted all of its IRS trading platforms in the U.S. to dealers alone,"" PFAC ¶ 
411, the SAC suggested that i-Swap's U.S. platform achieved a significant share of SEF trades and, in accordance with Dodd-
Frank's ""impartial access"" mandate, has been ""open for IRS trading by the buy side"" since its launch, see IRS I, 261 F. Supp. 3d 
at 484-85. An example as to Trad-X: documents cited in the PFAC identify the group of Dealers supporting Trad-X as a ""rival 
group"" to the three Dealers supporting i-Swap, Playforth Decl. Ex. 50 (email from JP Morgan representative about ""Project 
Snowflake"" meeting), and state that ""Trad-X will be a counter force to other platforms such as ICAP's i-SWAP, which is mainly 
supported by DB, JPM and BarCap,"" Playforth Decl. Ex. 51 (Credit Suisse PowerPoint presentation on ""Project Trad-X"")."
1505,10," As with ICAP and Tradition, defendants identify other problematic features of the alleged plot among Dealers against 
Bloomberg. Def. Mem. at 41-44. An example as to the CLOB allegations: Defendants note that these rest almost entirely on 
allegations that there is minimal trading on this platform. The PFAC, however, lacks circumstantial evidence that this limited 
trading resulted from inter-Dealer coordination. And documents cited in the PFAC suggest independent reasons for the limited 
trading, i.e., that ""many [buyside firms are] accustomed to receiving preferential quotes offered as part of the relationships they 
enjoy with their dealers,"" ""prices being quoted for RFQs are very tight,"" Playforth Decl. Ex. 49 (internal JP Morgan email 
exchanges) at 2-3, and ""most clients like to [RFQ] to find dealer axes that might not be reflected in the firm price,"" id. Ex. 48 
(Citigroup chat exchanges) at 6; see also PFAC ¶ 570 & n.617 (acknowledging that Bloomberg ""does not promote"" its CLOB and 
offers it at least partially because ""Dodd-Frank requires that all SEFs operate and offer an order book""). "
1506,11," The PFAC's allegations as to later events regarding IDCG are of a different nature. It alleges that IDCG later unsuccessfully 
sought a consortium investment from Dealers and others, but that, because the Dealers insisted on excessive equity and 
governance rights, no agreement was reached. PFAC ¶ 316. This negotiation does not describe a boycott; any claim as to it 
would be analyzed, if at all, under the rule of reason. The allegation that, in 2012, IDCG sold itself to the Dealer-controlled 
clearinghouse LCH.Clearnet, which ""neutralize[d] IDCG,"" id. ¶ 322, also does not describe per se unlawful conduct. "
1507,12," Document discovery continued after the substantial completion deadline. Today, as reflected on the Court's most recent status 
calls with counsel and counsel's submissions in advance of those calls, only discrete areas of document discovery remain 
incomplete. For example, the parties continue to discuss the adequacy of entries on certain privilege logs. Both sides have also 
sought—and the Court has authorized—discovery from custodians abroad pursuant to the Hague Convention; this discovery 
remains outstanding. "
1510,13," The Court has not included here the PFAC's allegations about Bloomberg, viewing these as occurring after Dodd-Frank and 
largely in or after 2013. "
1513,14," The Court has further recognized the practical reality that ""a regulated entity confronted with a regulatory subpoena may be 
unable or unwilling to resist the subpoena's document production demands, even where those demands, if made in federal civil 
litigation, would fail the standards of Rule 26."" Dkt. 266 at 4."
1513,15," Defendants would also have the right to take document and deposition discovery of the class plaintiffs who did not trade IRSs 
post-2013 and thus have been out of this case since IRS I, i.e., for the entire discovery period. This could entail negotiations as 
to custodians and search terms, production of responsive documents, and depositions of these plaintiffs' employees and 
investment advisors. "
1516,16," Also inapposite is S. African Apartheid Litig. v. Daimler AG, 617 F. Supp. 2d 228 (S.D.N.Y. 2009), the third case on which 
plaintiffs rely. It held that under Rule 15, the ""practical prejudice"" to a defendant ""of being subject to greater awards"" under the 
amended pleadings does not qualify as ""legal prejudice,"" i.e., prejudice cognizable under Rule 15. Id. at 290 (footnote omitted). 
The Court here does not find prejudice based on the prospect of a larger award but on the factors addressed above."
1516,17," Towards the same end, defendants note that, more than three months before filing the PFAC, plaintiffs' counsel had 
acknowledged that they believed document discovery supported an amendment on the subjects the PFAC addresses. See Dkt. 
408 (June 19, 2018 status letter); Dkt. 430 (July 17, 2018 status letter); Dkt. 457 (Transcript of July 19, 2018 telephone 
conference) at 61. "
1519,18," In its rule of reason allegations, the PFAC alleges that the anti-competitive effects of the ""Project Fusion"" and ""Project 
Magellan"" joint ventures outweighed their pro-competitive potential. See PFAC ¶¶ 661-65 (Tradeweb); id. ¶¶ 666-72 (CME). Its 
rule of reason pleadings focus on these two initiatives, and are not directed at the Dealers' conduct holistically during 2008-2012. 
As a result, there is a substantial argument that the proper subject of the market power inquiry under the rule of reason, as 
analyzed in IRS I and IRS II, is the market power of the two entities restrained by the defendants' joint ventures (i.e., Tradeweb 
and CME). As the Court has noted, these entities were providers of electronic trading platforms, not market makers. See IRS I, 
261 F. Supp. 3d at 469; IRS II, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 86732, 2018 WL 2332069, at *12-13; see also PFAC ¶ 627 
(acknowledging that relevant question under the DOJ joint venture guidelines is whether ""the joint venture has market power""). 
Therefore, although the PFAC alleges that the Dealers have a combined 70% market share in the ""IRS market,"" PFAC ¶ 638, 
that market appears a mismatch for the rule of the reason claim as pled. "
1520,," As an alternative to its theory of a rule of reason violation affecting the ""IRS market,"" the PFAC does, cursorily, plead for the first 
time that ""[d]efendants' own documents suggest that Tradeweb's share for execution of interest rate swaps with the buy side is 
at least 60% [and the] only other significant competitor is Bloomberg."" Id. ¶ 652. But this allegation, too, is problematic. It is not 
anchored to the 2008-2012 time period. And the PFAC does not attempt to define the electronic trading platform market. It 
leaves unclear on what basis it claims for Tradeweb a 60% market share of the subset of that market consisting of ""execution of 
interest rate swaps with the buy side,"" id., or whether such is a viably defined market, see Def. Mem. at 25-26. That the PFAC 
identifies numerous other electronic trading platforms for swaps trading makes the PFAC's passing suggestion that the platforms 
restrained had market power all the more problematic. See id. at 26. "

1539,1," The parties refer to the moving Defendants as ""Sutter Health et al. ('Sutter')."" (Notice of Motion, 1; see also Opposition, 1.) "
1541,2," Plaintiffs do not base their claims on any agreement of any kind between Sutter and other hospitals or healthcare providers. 
(Plaintiffs' Response to Separate Statement ¶ 7.) Accordingly, the court need not discuss horizontal price fixing or horizontal 
price tampering. "
1543,3," The Lathrop court did not focus on any distinction between horizontal and vertical price competition. Instead, it underscored the 
fact that one of the central purposes of the Cartwright Act is to promote price competition. (Lathrop, 4 Cal.3d at 362-63.)"
1543,4," The point Sutter is making here is that Sutter believes that all three theories of liability set forth in Counts I, II, and III should 
have been included in a single cause of action for unreasonable restraint of trade. (Motion, 23.) However, Sutter does not cite 
authority to support its implied assertion that the court should remove valid and distinct theories of liability from the case because 
they could have been alleged as a single cause of action. "
1544,5," Count II of the complaints is a separate claim for unreasonable restraint of trade in violation of the Cartwright Act. (See UEBT 
Complaint ¶¶ 146-154; People's Complaint ¶¶ 148-156.) "
1545,6," Under Section 1 of the Sherman Act: ""Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of 
trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal. Every person who shall make any 
contract or engage in any combination or conspiracy hereby declared to be illegal shall be deemed guilty of a felony, and, on 
conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding $100,000,000 if a corporation, or, if any other person, $1,000,000, or 
by imprisonment not exceeding 10 years, or by both said punishments, in the discretion of the court."" (15 U.S.C. § 1.) Plaintiffs 
suggest that the court should analogize their claim to a claim for conspiracy to monopolize under Section 1, which Plaintiffs 
contend lacks a specific intent requirement. (See Opposition, 19; City of Vernon v. Southern California Edison Co. (9th Cir. 
1992) 955 F.2d 1361, 1371 [stating in dicta that a Section 1 conspiracy to monopolize may exist even where one of the 
conspirators participates involuntarily or under coercion].) This line of argument is tangential. Plaintiffs' primary argument is that 
federal law is inapposite. (See Opposition, 18.) The reason that Sutter turns to Section 2 of the Sherman Act is because it deals 
specifically with monopolization. It is the strength of the analogy between Section 2 and California law that determines the weight 
to be given to Sutter's argument. "
1546,7," In re Cipro did not only cite cases decided under Section 2 of the Sherman Act. (See Palmer v. BRG of Georgia, Inc. (1990) 
498 U.S. 46, 111 S. Ct. 401, 112 L. Ed. 2d 349 [Section 1 case].)"
1546,8," During oral argument Sutter suggested that In re Cipro is limited to reverse patent settlement cases. The court respectfully 
rejects such a limited interpretation of the opinion."
1546,9," This conclusion is also consistent with Sutter's position that the claim is nothing more than a further theory that Sutter 
unreasonably restrained trade. (Motion, 23.) At the same time, it is consistent with Plaintiffs' argument that a ""combination to 
monopolize"" is analyzed like any other restraint of trade. (Opposition, 16-17.) To the extent there is nothing more here than a 
disagreement as to whether the theory should have been pled as part of the second cause of action rather than as the third 
cause of action, Sutter has not explained why this pleading formality makes a difference. "
1547,10," Plaintiffs submitted objections to evidence in conjunction with their opposition papers and Sutter did the same in conjunction 
with its reply papers. The motion is denied because Sutter did not meet its initial burden, even if its evidence is considered. 
Accordingly, the court does not rule on the evidentiary objections. (Cal. Code of Civ. Proc., § 437c(q).) "

1595,15," We note that Chesapeake filed an Application for Relief on September 14, 2018, bringing to our attention the Attorney 
General's August 11, 2018, draft proposed UTPCPL rulemaking, through which the Attorney General, in relevant part, articulated

1599,6," Appellants' exhibit listed 25 bills. The last bill, Senate Bill 578 of 2015, was described as still pending. On August 29, 2017, 
Senator Greenleaf reintroduced Senate Bill 578 of 2015 as Senate Bill 858 P.N. 1122 of 2017 (Senate Bill 858), and it was "
1600,," referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee on the same date. Thus, there have been 26 attempts — none yet successful. 
Senator Greenleaf's May 26, 2017 Memorandum describing Senate Bill 858 provides in pertinent part: In consultation with the Office of Attorney General, I am reintroducing Senate Bill 578, a comprehensive antitrust law. . . . . . . . The legislation authorizes only the Attorney General to file a civil action for an antitrust violation. The purpose of the law is 
to allow for a full and fair recovery to satisfy claims arising from an antitrust injury sustained by the Commonwealth and its 
residents and to provide the investigative tools to satisfactorily achieve this objective. The language is derived from other 
states' statutes and federal law. The legislation is intended to make illegal any contract, conspiracy or combination in restraint of trade and any 
monopolization in restraint of trade. The legislation also makes illegal any mergers or acquisitions that lessens competition 
substantially in any line of commerce. The legislation provides for criminal penalties for obstructing compliance with a 
subpoena and for knowingly removing or falsifying documents to be produced. Any such obstruction [**36]  or falsification 
constitutes a misdemeanor of the second degree. The legislation incorporates exemptions that are judicially recognized under federal antitrust laws. The Commonwealth 
Court would have original jurisdiction for all actions for violations of the statute. https://www.legis.state.pa.us//cfdocs/Legis/CSM/showMemoPublic.cfm?chamber=S&SPick=20170 
&cosponId=24006 
(last

combination in restraint of trade and any monopolization in restraint of trade"" are not currently prohibited under state law. Id."
1600,7," The Pennsylvania Supreme Court emphasized: 'Judicial power, as [**38]  contra distinguished from the power of the laws, has no existence. Courts are mere instruments 
of the law and can will nothing. . . . Judicial power is never exercised for the purpose of giving effect to the will of the Judge; 
always for the purpose of giving effect to the will of the Legislature; in other words, to the will of the law.' Osborn v.

Hurd v. District of Columbia, 864 F.3d 671, 678, 431 U.S. App. D.C. 83 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (quoting EEOC v. St. Francis Xavier 
Parochial Sch., 117 F.3d 621, 624, 326 U.S. App. D.C. 67 (D.C. Cir. 1997)); Eagle Tr. Fund v. U.S. Postal Serv., No. 17-cv-2450 
(KBJ), 365 F. Supp. 3d 57, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17334, 2019 WL 451350, at *5 (D.D.C. Feb. 4, 2019) (documents 
incorporated by reference in the complaint may be considered even when the document is attached as exhibit to defendant's 
motion to dismiss); Hinton v. Corr. Corp. of Am., 624 F. Supp. 2d 45, 46-47 (D.D.C. 2009) (collecting cases). "
1607,5," The defendants correctly frame these justiciability arguments as reasons to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Fed. R. 
Civ. P. 12(b)(6), rather than as reasons to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1). See Sickle v. Torres 
Advanced Enter. Sols., LLC, 884 F.3d 338, 345 & n.3 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (noting that ""merits-based barrier"" to claims posed by 
preemption challenge is subject to review under Rule 12(b)(6), by contrast to jurisdictional challenge implicating the power of the 
forum to adjudicate the dispute, which is resolved under Rule 12(b)(1)); Sierra Club v. Jackson, 648 F.3d 848, 853, 396 U.S. 
App. D.C. 297 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (noting that ""distinction between a claim that is not justiciable because relief cannot be granted 
upon it and a claim over which the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction is important,"" and finding justiciability challenge subject 
to review under Rule 12(b)(6)); see also Wilson v. EverBank, N.A., 77 F. Supp. 3d 1202, 1233 n.6 (S.D. Fla. 2015) (collecting 
cases holding that a motion to dismiss under the filed-rate doctrine is properly treated as part of a motion to dismiss under 
12(b)(6))."
1607,6," The defendants also initially argued that the first-to-file rule favored dismissal or a stay of this case because an earlier filed, 
pending case in Florida asserted similar claims. See Defs.' Mem. at 28-37. That Florida case has since been voluntarily 
dismissed, which the defendants concede ""disposes"" of their first-to-file argument. See Defs.' Notice of Supp. Auth. at 2, ECF 
No. 25. "
1611,7," The D.C. Circuit has not addressed whether the filed-rate doctrine applies to state-regulated insurance rates. Likewise, the 
D.C. Court of Appeals has not addressed this issue and only references the filed-rate doctrine in the context of public utilities. 
See, e.g., Office of People's Counsel v. D.C. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 989 A.2d 190, 193 (D.C. 2010); District of Columbia v. District 
of Columbia, PSC, 905 A.2d 249, 256-57 (D.C. 2006); Watergate E., Inc. v. D.C. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 662 A.2d 881, 888-89 
(D.C. 1995). The defendants, for their part, point to no provision of District of Columbia law requiring the plaintiff to exhaust any 
remedies with a state insurance agency prior to filing suit. Indeed, as for the CPPA claim, the D.C. Court of Appeals has 
explained that the legislative history of the CPPA confirms that it ""may be used even when other laws provide 'different 
enforcement procedures and mechanisms.'"" Atwater v. D.C. Dep't of Consumer & Regulatory Affairs, 566 A.2d 462, 467 (D.C. 
1989) (quoting Council of the District of Columbia, Comm. on Pub. Servs. & Consumer Affairs, Rep. on Bill No. 1-253, at 24 
(Mar. 24, 1976)); see also Osbourne v. Capital City Mortg. Corp., 727 A.2d 322, 325 (D.C. 1999) (""[W]hile the CPPA is broad in 
the conduct it proscribes, even more important perhaps is the array of enforcement mechanisms it contains.""). Cf. Alpert, 243 F. "
1612,," Supp. 3d at 1182-83 (noting that even though Washington recognizes the filed-rate doctrine, courts will consider state consumer 
protection act claims unless they ""run squarely against the filed[-]rate doctrine."" (internal citation and quotation marks omitted)). "
1613,8," Indeed, on Pearson's logic, which allowed a suit against the regulated entity, even a suit against UnitedHealth might withstand 
the filed-rate doctrine so long as the plaintiff challenged not the rates, but the unlawful allocation of funds. The Court need not 
decide this issue, however, as UnitedHealth is not a defendant in the instant action. "
1615,9," AARP and UnitedHealth have sought dismissal due, inter alia, to the filed-rate doctrine in other cases challenging the 4.95% 
charge, but those dismissal motions remain pending. See, e.g., Dane v. Unitedhealthcare Ins. Co., No. 18-cv-792-SRU (D. 
Conn.); Christoph v. AARP, Inc., No. 18-cv-3453-NIQA (E.D. Pa.). In addition, other similar cases have been dismissed 
voluntarily without a decision on the merits. See, e.g., Sacco v. AARP, Inc., No. 18-cv-14041-JEM (S.D. Fla. Jan. 23, 2019), 
Stipulation of Dismissal, ECF No. 89 (a putative class action filed on behalf of Florida residents against AARP and UnitedHealth 
and raising Florida law claims was stayed by the Southern District court of Florida and then voluntarily dismissed upon the 
Eleventh Circuit's denial of a petition for rehearing in Patel); Baruch v. AARP, Inc., No. 18-cv-1563-AJN (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 
2018), Notice of Voluntary Dismissal, ECF No. 30 (a putative class action filed on behalf of New York residents raising New York 
state claims against AARP and UnitedHealth). "
1617,10," Notably, the plaintiff made this argument before the Eleventh Circuit issued its opinion in Patel, holding that the filed-rate 
doctrine applies when an intermediary passes the cost of regulator-approved rates on to a third party. See 904 F.3d at 1322. "
1618,11," In reply, the defendants suggest that Section 148 of the Second Restatement concerning ""fraud and misrepresentation,"" 
should be applied here rather than Section 145. See Defs.' Reply at 21-22. While the D.C. Court of Appeals has previously 
looked to Section 148 as a ""useful framework for selecting the law which applies to multi-state misrepresentation claims,"" 
Hercules & Co., Ltd. v. Shama Restaurant Corp., 566 A.2d 31, 43 (D.C. 1989), more recent cases primarily look to Section 145, 
see Washkoviak, 900 A.2d at 182 n.18 (relying on Section 145 but noting the result would be no different under Section 148); 
Jones v. Clinch, 73 A.3d 80, 82 (D.C. 2013) (citing Hercules but nonetheless relying on Section 145 when analyzing a CPPA 
claim alleging misrepresentation); see [**52]  also In re APA Assessment Fee Litig., 766 F.3d at 53-55 (following Washkoviak 
and conducting an analysis of choice of law for misrepresentation claims under Section 145, but concluding there would be no 
difference if the question were considered under Section 148); Margolis v. U-Haul Int'l, Inc., 818 F. Supp. 2d 91, 102 n.7 (D.D.C. 
2011) (pointing to counsel's concession that ""there is no case under the CPPA in the Superior Courts or in federal court that has 
ever applied [Section] 148"") (internal alteration and quotation marks omitted); Mobile Satellite Commcn's, Inc. v. Intelsat USA 
Sales Corp., 646 F. Supp. 2d 124, 130 (D.D.C. 2009) (noting that the D.C. Court of Appeals ""has applied [Section] 145 even in 
cases of fraudulent misrepresentation,"" and citing both Washkoviak and Hercules). Given this background, the Court concludes 
that Section 145 provides the appropriate framework. The plaintiff's motion for leave to submit a surreply to address this 
argument (among others) is therefore unnecessary. See Pl.'s Mot. for Leave to File Surreply, ECF No. 17. Further, as the 
defendants note, see Defs.' Opp'n to Pl.'s Mot. for Leave to File Surreply at 4, ECF No. 18, the plaintiff has failed to attach her 
proposed surreply for the Court's consideration. See id. (citing Glass v. Lahood, 786 F. Supp. 2d 189, 231 (D.D.C. 2011) (in 
which the plaintiff submitted her proposed surreply so that the Court could evaluate whether it was warranted); Crummey v. Soc. 
Sec. Admin., 794 F. Supp. 2d 46, 54, 63-64 (D.D.C. 2011) (same)). Therefore, the plaintiff's Motion for Leave to File a Surreply 
is denied as both defective and unnecessary, since the issues the plaintiff seeks to address would not aid in the Court's 
resolution of the pending motion to dismiss. "
1624,12," As for the plaintiff's argument that she has alleged standing by virtue of asserting a violation of her statutory right to truthful 
information, the Court agrees with the defendants that this alleged violation, without more, is insufficient to establish standing. 
See Defs.' Mem. at 39-40; Pl.'s Opp'n at 37-38. ""Although it might violate the CPPA to present misleading information even if no 
one was misled, a private plaintiff cannot bring a suit in federal court to enforce that claim unless he or she has suffered an injury 
in fact."" Mann v. Bahi, 251 F. Supp. 3d 112, 119 (D.D.C. 2017) (citing Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1548, 194 L. Ed. 
2d 635 (2016)). The plaintiff does not have standing unless she can allege that the defendants violated the CPPA and that she 
suffered an injury in fact as a result. See Hancock v. Urban Outfitters, Inc., 830 F.3d 511, 514, 424 U.S. App. D.C. 251 (D.C. Cir. 
2016); Silvious v. Snapple Beverage Co., 793 F. Supp. 2d 414, 417 (D.D.C. 2011) (collecting cases for the proposition that ""a 
lawsuit under the CPPA does not relieve a plaintiff of the requirement to show a concrete injury-in-fact to himself"")."
1624,13," The plaintiff lacks standing, however, to pursue injunctive relief under the CPPA, see Compl. ¶ 103, because she does not 
allege that she is currently enrolled in an AARP Medigap policy. See Owner-Operator Indep. Drivers Ass'n, Inc. v. U.S. Dep't of 
Transp., 879 F.3d 339, 346 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (plaintiffs must demonstrate standing separately for each form of relief sought, and 
standing for prospective relief requires showing continuing or imminent harm); Levay, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 116585, 2018 WL 
3425014, at *3 (holding that plaintiffs lacked standing to pursue injunctive relief when they had not alleged how they would 
continue to be harmed by AARP's misrepresentations concerning the Medigap policies). "
1630,14," By contrast, claims alleging violations of the CPPA are not subject to this heightened pleading standard. See, e.g., Frese v. 
City Segway Tours of Wash., D.C., 249 F. Supp. 3d 230, 235 (D.D.C. 2017); McMullen, 164 F. Supp. 3d at 90-91; Campbell v. 
Nat'l Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, 130 F. Supp. 3d 236, 267 (D.D.C. 2015) (collecting cases). "
1634,1," On a motion for judgment on the pleadings, as here, the Court may take into account the parties' pleadings and any documents 
physically attached to those pleadings or incorporated by reference. See, e.g., Gonzalez v. Planned Parenthood of L.A., No. CV 
05-8818 AHM FMOX, 2011 WL 1481398, at *2 (C.D. Cal. Apr. 19, 2011). Although the defendant generally ""cannot rely on 
factual allegations contained in the answer . . . [because] all allegations in the answer are automatically deemed denied,"" Rutter 
Group Prac. Guide Fed. Civ. Pro. Before Trial Ch. 9-E, OnStar cites to the transcript of Plaintiff's testimony at an April 19, 2016 
evidentiary hearing in responding to Plaintiff's allegations. See generally Ans. In ruling on OnStar's Motion, the Court may 
consider Plaintiff's testimony, as incorporated by reference into OnStar's Answer, which constitutes a binding judicial admission. 
See, e.g., Yagman v. Allianz Ins., No. LACV1500921JAKJCX, 2015 WL 5553462, at *3 (C.D. Cal. July 9, 2015) (granting Rule 
12(b)(6) motion to dismiss on the basis of statement made by the plaintiff at oral argument); see also Hornberger v. Merrill 
Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., No. SACV141645DOCRNBX, 2015 WL 13310465, at *3 (C.D. Cal. Jan. 22, 2015) (judicial 
admissions may be considered in ruling on a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6)), aff'd, 677 F. App'x 336 (9th Cir. 
2017); Baez v. Falor, No. CIV.A. 09-1149, 2011 WL 5406148, at *6 (W.D. Pa. Sept. 21) (testimony from evidentiary hearing may 
be considered in resolving motion for judgment on the pleadings), report and recommendation adopted, 2011 WL 5374986 (Nov. 
8, 2011). "
1635,2," The Terms and Conditions also provided that ""WE BOTH AGREE, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, TO 
USE CONFIDENTIAL ARBITRATION, NOT LAWSUITS (except for small claims court cases) TO RESOLVE THE DISPUTE."" 
Tr. at 17:11-17; Ex. 4 (emphasis in original). "
1639,3," To be clear, the Court does not consider the October 14, 2014 email from OnStar, see Tr. at 75:9-83:10, 84:11-85:15, 96:7-
101:13; ECF Nos. 35-5 (""Ex. 5""), 35-7 (""Ex. 8""), to which Mr. Nicholis Festa, OnStar's director of marketing, see Tr. at 46:20-
47:2, testified at April 19, 2016 evidentiary hearing. Because Plaintiff did not testify to her receipt of the October 14, 2014 email, 
it is not a judicial admission binding as to her. See, e.g., Am. Title Ins. Co. v. Lacelaw Corp., 861 F.2d 224, 226 (9th Cir. 1988) 
(""Factual assertions in pleadings and pretrial orders, unless amended, are considered judicial admissions conclusively binding 
on the party who made them."") (emphasis added). "
1642,4," As discussed above, see supra pages 12-13 & note 3, the Court also concludes based on the record before it that Plaintiff's 
alleged injury was not ""reasonably avoidable,"" as advocated by OnStar. See Mot. at 15. "
1648,1," The Court may properly look to this document (D.I. 284-6; D.I. 284-8) in evaluating the motion to dismiss, even though it is not 
cited in the SAA, because it is plainly integral to and a basis for Autel's counterclaims. See In re Burlington Coat Factory Sec. 
Litig., 114 F.3d 1410, 1426 (3d Cir. 1997) (stating that party ""cannot prevent a court from looking at the texts of the documents 
on which its claim is based by failing to attach or explicitly cite them""); Pension Benefit Guar. Corp. v. White Consol. Indus., 998 
F.2d 1192, 1196 (3d Cir. 1993) (""A court may consider an undisputedly authentic document that a defendant attaches as an 
exhibit to a motion to dismiss if the plaintiff's claims are based on the document.""); D.I. 291 at 10 (Autel acknowledging its 
counterclaims rely on ""facts derived from [this] document, among other sources"")) "
1650,2," Given the Court's conclusions, it is not necessary to address DJI's separate contention that Autel's claims fail also because of 
the meaning of ""cost"" as used in the DJI accounting sheet. (See D.I. 283 at 12-14; D.I. 291 at 15-19) Nor will the Court reach 
DJI's identification of deficiencies in Autel's pleading of intent to monopolize, likelihood of recoupment, or the relevant market. "
1654,1," Maine Controls has not moved for dismissal of Patriot's breach of contract claim, Count IX, in the instant motion. (Pl's Compl. 
¶¶ 96-101.) As noted in Me. Rubber Int'l, Patriot still have ""the traditional recourse for breach of contract and any damages [it] 
can prove under contract law standards, given the contract [it] entered into. Contract law allows for foreseeable damages arising 
from the breach (though these may be limited by the contractual language.)"" 298 F. Supp. 2d at 138 & n. 7; see also Peachtree 
Doors, 659 A.2d at 271 (""Plaintiffs' claims for economic damages—'the costs of all repairs, renovation, corrections and 
replacements related to the Defendant's defective performance of its contract'—are properly addressable under a warranty 
theory.""). "
1655,2," Section 1104 gives any person injured directly or indirectly in its business or property by another person's violation of section 
1101 or 1101 a private right of action to sue for the injury. 10 M.R.S. § 1104."
1655,3," Maine courts may consider federal antitrust law as persuasive authority when construing Maine's antitrust statute. McKinnon 
v. Honeywell Int'l, Inc., 2009 ME 69, ¶ 19, 977 A.2d 420."
1655,4," Patriot does not object to the Court considering Def's Ex. C, a public filing with the Maine Secretary of State that shows Maine 
Controls is an assumed name of Mechanical Services. See Moody v. State Liquor & Lott. Comm'n, 2004 ME 20, ¶ 11, 843 A.2d 
43. However, in its written opposition, Patriot does argue that it is a question of fact as to whether the two Defendants are in fact 
the same company, notwithstanding its allegation in paragraph 15 of its Complaint: ""The exact relationship between Maine 
Controls and Mechanical services is unclear but it appears that for all intents and purposes, they are the same entity."" (emphasis 
added). It seems that Def's Ex. C is dispositive of this factual issue, but in any event, it is not really relevant to Patriot's section 
1101 claim. The effect of the Defendants' combined control of the market in Maine, and whether that effect is anticompetitive, is 
more properly considered in the context of a section 1102 claim, which is discussed below. "
1656,5," Maine Controls claims that even in relation to this single Project, it could not have ""cornered the market"" because it was only 
one of six approved vendors for the Project. (Def's Ex. A.) Patriot alleges, and argues, that regardless of what is reflected in 
Defendants' Exhibit A, only Maine Control's service and components would have been acceptable. (Pl's Compl. ¶¶ 10-12.) 
Patriot is entitled to try to prove this allegation at trial; however, as explained above, it was required to allege more—and need to 
prove more—to prevail on a section 1102 antitrust claim. "
1659,1," In a prior Order (ECF No. 465), the Court addressed Plaintiff's submission (ECF No. 440) regarding discovery disputes and, 
upon agreement of the parties, reserved certain issues regarding the expert report of Mark Glueck and related sanctions 
requests. The Court herein addresses those remaining issues. "
1660,2," Plaintiff contends that ""some of Bankrate's [editorial] listings are hyperlinked and others are not,"" PRSMF ¶ 8, but its evidence 
does not support that assertion."
1660,3," Although Plaintiff purports to dispute the foregoing paragraphs in Defendant's Statement of Material Facts, it appears to accept 
Defendant's description of the basic mechanics of its co-branding partnerships. See PRSMF ¶¶ 62-65. "
1661,4," The Court notes that Defendant moved to strike the declaration of Plaintiff's witness Norbert Mehl, ECF No. 416. The Court has 
considered Mr. Mehl's declaration and finds to the extent it was based on his personal knowledge, Defendant's motion to strike 
the declaration of Mr. Mehl is denied. Nevertheless, insofar as Mr. Mehl speculates about matters beyond his personal 
knowledge and offers legal conclusions, the Court finds Mr. Mehl's declaration unhelpful and disregards those portions of the 
declaration. See S.E.C. v. Adoni, 60 F. Supp. 2d 401, 402 (D.N.J. 1999) (denying motion to strike affidavits because ""it would be 
more appropriate to disregard those portions of the affidavits that were not factual recitations based on personal knowledge.""); 
D.N.J Civ. R. 7.2; Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(4); Reynolds v. Dep't of Army, No. 08-2944, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 65600, 2010 WL 
2674045, at *9 (D.N.J. June 30, 2010) (rejecting affidavit that reflected the affiant's ""perceived view"" of the facts rather than 
actual knowledge of them); PNY Techs., Inc. v. Samsung Elecs. Co., Ltd., No. 10-4587, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46500, 2011 WL 
1630856, at *3 (D.N.J. Apr. 29, 2011) (noting that a declaration must present a basis in fact for the ""conclusory assertion"" that it 
was made on personal knowledge); Cant Strip Corp. of Am. v. Schuller Int'l Inc., No. 92-2212, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21045, 
1995 WL 767805, at *4 (D. Ariz. Sept. 27, 1995) (opinions made by owners of plaintiffs in affidavits regarding relevant antitrust 
market and market power are not competent evidence but improper legal conclusions). Further, such deficiencies are 
problematic for lay witness testimony offered pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 701. See Fed. R. Evid. 701. Moreover, 
Plaintiff did not offer Mr. Mehl as an expert witness. See Pl. Opp. to Def.'s Mot to Strike, ECF No. 423, at 4. Therefore, Mr. Mehl 
may not offer testimony within the scope of Federal Rule of Evidence 702. See, e.g., Hirst v. Inverness Hotel Corp., 544 F.3d 
221, 225, 50 V.I. 1122 (3d Cir. 2008). In addition, Plaintiff requested that this Court strike several of Defendant's declarations and the expert report of Mark Glueck. 
ECF No. 417-2. In the Court's September 26, 2014 Order deciding a motion to set aside a pretrial order of the Magistrate Judge 
(ECF No. 438), the parties agreed, and the Court advised, that certain issues regarding the opinions of Mr. Glueck would be 
decided in conjunction with the parties' summary judgment motions. ECF No. 465, at 2, 4. The Court now decides this issue. The 
Defendant has informed the Court that it is ""not relying upon Mr. Glueck's opinions in any way in connection with the pending 
summary judgment motions"" and has asked this Court to ""disregard the few citations to Mr. Glueck's reports contained in the 
summary judgment briefs."" ECF No. 443 at n.2. Accordingly, the Court has disregarded any citation to Mr. Glueck's report in the 
summary judgment briefing and Plaintiff's motion to strike the expert report of Mr. Glueck is moot. Any related request for 
sanctions is inappropriate under the circumstances of this case where there appears to be no evidence to show that Defendant 
had any knowledge of the alleged issues surrounding Mr. Glueck. See Tr. 86:25-87:5; Ford Motor Co. v. Summit Motor Prod., 
Inc., 930 F. 2d. 277, 289 (3d Cir. 1991) (sanctions are prescribed only in exceptional circumstances where a party's conduct is 
unreasonable) (citation omitted). Plaintiff also requested that this Court strike the third-party declarations of Philip N. Mancuso, Alexandra Poison, and John 
Walsh for failure to identify these witnesses as required by Rule 26(a) or (c). ECF No. 417-2 at 18. Defendant states that 
Bankrate instead satisfied the requirements of Rule 26(e)(1)(A) because the additional declarants became known to Plaintiff 
""during the discovery process."" See ECF No. 419-2 at 5. Courts do not exclude statements of witnesses who are made known 
through discovery. See, e.g., Newman v. GHS Osteopathic, Inc., 60 F.3d 153, 156 (3d Cir. 1995) (no abuse of discretion when 
district court refused to exclude testimony because other party knew names of witnesses and scope of their knowledge). Thus, 
the Court will not exclude the declarations of Philip N. Mancuso, Alexandra Poison, and John Walsh. Finally, Plaintiff argues that 
the declaration of Ms. Poison should be disregarded based on the ""sham affidavit doctrine."" ECF No. 417-2 at 21. The sham 
affidavit doctrine states that ""a party may not create a material issue of fact or defeat summary judgment by filing an affidavit 
disputing his or her own sworn testimony without demonstrating a plausible explanation for the conflict."" Baer v. Chase, 392 F.3d 
609, 624 (3d Cir. 2004). In the instant case, there is no applicable earlier sworn statement or deposition testimony by Ms. 
Poison. Plaintiff attempts to contradict Ms. Poison's declaration with an internal business document produced to Plaintiff in 
response to a Rule 45 Subpoena, which is not a sworn statement or deposition testimony. See Caro Assocs. II, LLC v. Best Buy 
Co., No 09-97, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29155, 2012 WL 762304, at *4 (D.N.J. Mar. 6, 2012) (sham affidavit doctrine did not apply 
where sworn testimony contradicted by email). Accordingly, the Court finds that the doctrine does not apply under these 
circumstances. "
1664,5," Plaintiff also argues that its expert, Stan V. Smith, provides testimony with respect to issues related to the relevant market. Pl. 
Br. in Reply, ECF No. 421, at 6. Mr. Smith admits that his knowledge in this regard is limited to the market as defined in the 
Seventh Amended Complaint, without referring to ""other publicly available revenue figures pertaining to the relevant market from 
other companies identical to Banxcorp or Bankrate."" ECF No. 390-3 at 11-12; see also id. at 7 (""The evolution of the market for 
Bank Rate Websites is described in the 7AC . . . . I am not providing any opinion regarding these issues.""); id. (""The structure of 
the relevant market before and after the alleged monopolization is set forth in the 7AC . . . . I am not providing any opinion 
regarding these issues.""). "
1665,6," See DSMF ¶ 1, PSMF ¶ 1. "
1666,7," Plaintiff refers to Defendant's alleged predatory practices as ""akin to a price squeeze."" Pl. Br. in Opp., ECF No. 410, at 3. "
1668,8," At oral argument, Plaintiff appeared to argue that it had difficulty obtaining co-branding partners because potential co-branding 
partners preferred to work with Bankrate due to Bankrate's higher web traffic. Tr. 114:17-115:4. However, Plaintiff fails to explain 
how Bankrate's apparent success at maintaining co-branding partnerships is distinguishable from ""development as a 
consequence of a superior product, business acumen, or historic accident."" See Broadcom, 501 F.3d 297 at 307 (internal 
quotation marks and citation omitted). Moreover, the Third Circuit has rejected the argument, when offered ""without some 
limiting principle,"" that a defendant's superior market reputation is a barrier to entry. See Advo, 51 F.3d at 1201-02."
1668,9," The Court also notes that some of the co-branding agreements Plaintiff identifies relate to advertising in print newspapers and 
are therefore outside the scope of Plaintiff's proposed FABRTL market. See PSMF ¶ 237. "
1669,10," Insofar as Plaintiff's summary judgment briefing references other acquisitions, those acquisitions were not pleaded in the 
Seventh Amended Complaint and are therefore not properly before this Court. The Court notes that a plaintiff ""may not amend 
his complaint through arguments in his brief in opposition to a motion for summary judgment."" See Baklayan v. Ortiz, No. 11-
3943, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 115712, 2012 WL 3560384, at * 3 (D.N.J. Aug. 15, 2012) (""The Third Circuit has made clear that a 
plaintiff may not amend his complaint through arguments raised in an opposition brief."") (citation omitted)."
1669,11," Plaintiff also points to a statement by Bankrate's former CEO, Elisabeth DeMarse, that ""Bankrate had an acquisition strategy 
aimed at buying number 1 and number 2 in every category [] in the consumer finance markets."" See PSMF ¶ 246. However, Ms. 
DeMarse's testimony concerns Bankrate's acquisition of creditcards.com, see Pl. Appx. G27 at Tr. 87:14-20, 88:12-24, which is 
not at issue in the Seventh Amended Complaint, see 7AC ¶¶ 308-312. "
1670,12," Defendant also argues that (1) Plaintiff lacks antitrust injury and therefore standing under the antitrust laws, (2) many of 
Plaintiff's claims are time barred, and (3) Plaintiff lacks Article III standing to seek injunctive relief. As detailed at length 
throughout this Opinion, Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that Defendant engaged in the type of anti-competitive practices 
barred by antitrust law, and thus Plaintiff cannot establish an antitrust injury in this case. See Atl. Richfield Co. v. USA 
Petroleum Co., 495 U.S. 328, 334, 110 S. Ct. 1884, 109 L. Ed. 2d 333 (1990) (""[A] plaintiff must prove the existence of an 
antitrust injury, which is to say injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flows from that which makes 
defendants' acts unlawful . . . injury, although causally related to an antitrust violation, nevertheless will not qualify as an antitrust 
injury unless it is attributable to an anti-competitive aspect of the practice under scrutiny."") (internal citations and quotation marks 
omitted). Defendant also raised arguments regarding the timeliness of Plaintiff's claims and Plaintiff's request for injunctive relief. 
The Court need not consider Defendant's additional arguments because Defendant is entitled to summary judgment on all 
counts of the Seventh Amended Complaint."
1670,13," Defendant moved to strike the declaration of Plaintiff's witness, Stan V. Smith. ECF No. 415. Mr. Smith's declaration contains 
his opinions on damages, which is not relevant given the procedural posture. Thus, Defendant's motion to strike the declaration 
and opinions of Mr. Smith is moot."
1670,1," In a prior Order (ECF No. 465), the Court addressed Plaintiff's submission (ECF No. 440) regarding discovery disputes and, 
upon agreement of the parties, reserved certain issues regarding the expert report of Mark Glueck and related sanctions 
requests. In the Opinion accompanying this Order, the Court addresses those remaining issues. "
1674,1," Plaintiff also names Genesis and Perry with respect to Count III (breach of fiduciary duty against Perry), Count XIV 
(recharacterization against Genesis), Count XV (equitable subordination against Genesis), Count XVI (avoidance of preference 
period transfers against Genesis), Counts XVII and XVIII (avoidance of fraudulent transfers against Genesis), Count XIX 
(recovery of avoided transfers against Genesis), and Count XX (allowance of all claims against Genesis). However, these claims 
are not the subject of Defendants' pending Motion. "
1677,2," Clause B of the Termination Agreement reads: ""Each party reserves all of its rights, remedies, claims, defenses and affirmative 
defenses arising under, related to, or subject to the provisions of section 9.8 of the Management Agreement. Nothing in this 
Agreement shall be deemed to affect either Party's rights related to Section 9.8 in any way."" (Opp'n at 20.) "
1683,1, 15 U.S.C. § 1114(1)(a) (section 32) and 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a)(1)(A) (section 43(a)).
1683,2," Defendants assert that 96.9% of their collective sales, totaling €54,858,043.41, were purely foreign sales because they took 
place in a foreign country, between a foreign buyer and foreign seller, and were designated for destination in a foreign country. 
They assert that 3.1% of collective sales, totaling €1,750,211.35, took place in a foreign country, between a foreign buyer and 
foreign seller, but the foreign buyer designated United States as ""the ultimate location where the [product was] intended to be 
used."" Doc. no. 262, p. 3. According to defendants, foreign customers purchase RRCs as components for larger pieces of 
machinery, such as cranes, and the machinery is what is destined for the United States. Defendants argue that neither of these 
categories of foreign sales fall within the extraterritorial reach of the Lanham Act, but urge that, at the very least, the purely 
foreign sales are not subject to the Lanham Act."
1683,3," The Vanity Fair test was developed from the Supreme Court's decision in Steele v. Bulova Watch Co., 344 U.S. 280, 73 S. Ct. 
252, 97 L. Ed. 319, 1953 Dec. Comm'r Pat. 424 (1952), wherein the Court gave the provisions of the Lanham Act extraterritorial 
application against infringing conduct committed in Mexico by an American citizen."
1683,4," Defendants concede the court has subject matter jurisdiction over the Lanham Act claims involving direct sales into the United 
States. According to defendants, these sales were made by ABIG and Hetronic Germany GmbH. These sales, defendants 
assert, total €219,237.07 (€202,134.12 of RRCs and €17,102.95 of spare parts). Plaintiff challenges defendants' sales figures 
not only for direct sales to the United States but also for the foreign sales previously noted. For purposes of adjudicating 
defendants' motion, the court need not address plaintiff's challenge. "
1684,5, Acronym for Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market.
1684,6," The third factor breaks down into a seven-part test exploring such things as the degree of conflict with foreign law and the 
nationality and allegiance of the parties. See, Star-kist Foods, Inc., 769 F.2d at 1395. "
1685,7," Plaintiff has recently filed a request for judicial notice or, in the alternative, motion for leave to supplement opposition to 
defendants' motion for partial summary judgment. Doc. no. 309. Plaintiff states ""the OHIM tribunal just issued its ruling, rejecting 
defendants' attempt to invalidate Hetronic's EU community NOVA trademark. Moreover, as a result of the OHIM tribunal's ruling, 
defendants' German NOVA trademark (which was obtained after Hetronic's) is invalid."" It also states that ""newly acquired 
evidence shows that defendants continue to actively sell products that they know are intended for use in the United States."" Id. 
at ECF p. 2. Plaintiff requests the court to take judicial notice of these facts or permit plaintiff to supplement its opposition to 
defendants' motion for partial summary judgment ""so the record contains complete and accurate facts that did not exist at the 
time of the summary judgment briefing."" Id. at ECF p. 6. In light of the court's ruling on the extraterritorial application of the 
Lanham Act, as subsequently discussed, which favors plaintiff, the court finds it unnecessary to grant the requested relief. The 
court is also cognizant of plaintiff's representation that ""[t]hat the EU Trademark Regulations allow any party adversely affected 
by a decision to appeal . . . Defendants have filed a notice indicating their intention to appeal."" Id. at ECF p. 3. n. 1. The court 
therefore DENIES plaintiff's request and motion. "
1687,8," According to defendants, the GA product was a predecessor to the HH product, which is one of the products at issue."
1687,9, The court notes defendants proffer no expert affidavit on the differences between German and United States trademark laws. 
1688,10," The court further notes that in their motion, defendants represent that the law of Austria would also apply to some foreign 
sales. However, defendants have provided nothing but a bare assertion that Austrian trademark law is different from United 
States trademark law. The court finds that a bare assertion is not adequate to show a conflict of law."
1688,11," The Ninth Circuit has said that ""[a] defendant's foreign activities need not have a substantial effect or even significant effect on 
American commerce, rather, 'some effect' may be sufficient."" Trader Joe's Company v. Hallatt, 835 F.3d 960, 969 (9th Cir. 
2016). "
1691,12," Defendants also appear to challenge extraterritorial application of Oklahoma unfair competition law to their foreign sales. This 
claim is alleged in Count 9 of the Second Amended Complaint. As defendants rely upon the same authorities to challenge that 
claim, the court, for the reasons already expressed, finds that defendants are not entitled to partial summary judgment on the 
common-law unfair competition claim."
1691,13," In its response, plaintiff claims that ABIG and ABIA sold products with the ""Hetronic"" trademark to Hydronic Handelsges 
m.b.H, another Fuchs' owned corporation. The evidence cited in support of the claim (doc. no. 260, ¶ 103), indicates that HG 
and HCEE sold the Hetronic-labeled parts to Hydronic Handelsges m.b.H."
1691,14," Section 43(a) precludes any person from using ""any false designation of origin"" which ""is likely to cause confusion, or to cause 
mistake, or to deceive as to the affiliation, connection, or association of such person with another person, or as to the origin, 
sponsorship, or approval of his or her goods, services, or commercial activities by another person."" 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a)(1)(A). "
1692,15," In response to plaintiff's summary judgment motion on the section 43(a) claim, defendants raise additional arguments to 
challenge the merits of the claim. Those grounds were not raised in support of defendants' motion, so the court declines to 
address those arguments here. "
1693,16," The court concludes that to the extent defendants are challenging the state-law unfair competition claim based upon the issue 
of ownership, defendants are likewise not entitled to partial summary judgment."
1693,17," Defendants' partial summary judgment record does not contain the paragraphs of plaintiff's expert's report which discuss the 
$5.4 million attorneys' fees. See, Attachments 1 and 2 of doc. no. 263. Nonetheless, the referenced paragraphs of the report, ¶¶ 
89-91, are in the court's record at Ex. 152, attachment 88 to doc. no. 261, p. 38, and there appears to be no dispute over the 
expert's statements. "
1695,18," This leaves plaintiff in the position of suing, in this case, to recover more than $5 million spent pursuing Rempe, to get what 
would appear to be an uncollectable judgment which included $3.1 million in attorneys' fees incurred in this case. That claim will 
be measured by at least a minimal standard of reasonableness (see, doc. no. 211 in CIV-14-0787), to say nothing of the jury's 
consideration of whether that whole exercise made any sense in the first place. Without deciding, at this point, whether Rule 3.7 
of the Oklahoma Rules of Professional Conduct (as adopted by this court) would preclude counsel of record in this case from 
testifying on the first issue (reasonableness of the fees — see, Rule 3.7 (a)(2)), it seems unlikely that counsel in this case would "
1696,," be eligible to testify on the second issue (whether the whole exercise made any sense in the first place). The exceptions in Rule 
3.7 would not appear to go that far."
1696,19," ""Conversion is defined by Oklahoma law as any act of dominion wrongfully exerted over another's personal property in denial 
of or inconsistent with his right therein."" American Biomedical Group, Inc. v. Techtrol, Inc., 2016 OK 55, 374 P.3d 820, 825 
(Okla. 2016) (quotation omitted). "
1697,20," The court rejects defendants' argument that the conversion claim as pled is seeking relief based upon a conversion of 
intangible property. Although Count 10 refers to ""confidential information,"" it also refers to defendants taking ""possession"" of 
""confidential information."" This can include the drawings, schematics, documents and equipment which plaintiff refers. And 
although plaintiff does seek to enjoin the ""use"" of the confidential information, it also seeks the return of the materials. Because the court concludes that there is evidence, viewed in plaintiff's favor, to support the conversion claim as pled, the court 
need not decide whether plaintiff's claim should be construed as a claim for misappropriation of confidential business 
information. The court notes, however, that the issue of whether plaintiff can maintain a conversion claim was originally raised by 
defendants in their challenge to the First Amended Complaint, and in seeking to file the Second Amended Complaint, plaintiff did 
not seek to include any misappropriation claim. "
1698,21," Whether this expert, or any other, will be permitted to opine on legal issues is a matter for another day, "
1700,1," Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint is referred to as ""FAC,"" D.E. 64. Defendants' moving brief is referred to as ""Def. Br.,"" D.E. 
14-1. Plaintiff's brief in opposition is referred to as ""Pl. Opp'n,"" D.E. 31. Defendants' reply is referred to as ""Def. Reply,"" D.E. 32. "
1701,," Plaintiff's letter providing supplemental authority will be referred to as ""Pl. Ltr.,"" D.E. 48. Defendants' response to Plaintiff's letter 
will be referred to as ""Def. Resp.,"" D.E. 50."
1701,2," The facts are derived from Plaintiff's FAC. D.E. 64. When reviewing a motion to dismiss, the Court accepts as true all well-
pleaded facts in the complaint. Fowler v. UPMC Shadyside, 578 F.3d 203, 210 (3d Cir. 2009). Additionally, a district court may 
consider ""exhibits attached to the complaint and matters of public record"" as well as ""an undisputedly authentic document that a 
defendant attaches as an exhibit to a motion to dismiss if the plaintiff's claims are based on the document."" Pension Ben. Guar. 
Corp. v. White Consol. Indus., Inc., 998 F.2d 1192, 1196 (3d Cir. 1993). "
1702,3," For a successful appeal, a physician must establish (i) failure of the drug listed on the formulary to effectively treat the patient's 
condition, or (ii) the patient's inability to tolerate the side effects or other problems caused by the drug listed on the formulary. Id. 
¶¶ 63-65. "
1703,4," As noted, Plan 3 actually refers to four separate top-ten plans that are negotiated jointly though one administrator. Id. ¶ 98. The 
FAC does not indicate whether Plan 1 and Plan 2 negotiate through an administrator or through their own representatives."
1703,5," Plaintiff does not attach the actual contracts between Allergan and these Part D plans but notes that ""[a]greements of this 
nature are not available to the public and typically contain confidentiality provisions that prohibit their disclosure to anyone 
except the parties to the agreements."" Id. ¶ 108. Therefore, Plaintiff drew on its own interactions with the Part D plans to form its 
factual allegations. "
1704,6," Plaintiff does not identify who (by position) from Plan 3 made these statements. Similarly, Plaintiff does not indicate the position 
of the ""Shire executive."" "
1707,7," The Aetna court also had to determine whether the public exchanges under the Affordable Care Act could comprise a 
separate relevant market."
1707,8," The Aetna decision followed trial so that the district court had information not be available at the motion to dismiss state. For 
example, the court in Aetna considered econometric evidence indicating that a merger would substantially dampen competition 
in the Medicare Advantage market and evidence demonstrating how head-to-head competition in the Medicare Advantage 
market benefited consumers by lowing premiums and copays. Id. at 33-45."
1707,9," ""Gary's"" full name was Eagleville Pharmacy, Incorporated d/b/a I Got It at Gary's. Brokerage Concepts, Inc., 140 F.3d at 501, 
505."
1707,10," The plaintiff characterized the defendant's actions as a form of unlawful tying. Id. at 508, 510. Ultimately, the Third Circuit 
disagreed and found that the alleged conduct fell somewhere between a tying arrangement and reciprocal dealing. Id. at 511. "
1708,11," The Third Circuit in Federal Trade Commission v. Penn State Hershey Medical Center, 838 F.3d 327, 339-41 (3d Cir. 2016), 
disagreed with the Little Rock court's analysis as to relevant geographic market. The Circuit explained that in determining the 
relevant geographic market, the Little Rock court (although not expressly), used the ""Elzinga—Hogarty test,"" which ""first, [looks 
to] the number of customers who come from outside the proposed market to purchase goods and services from inside of it, and, 
second, [looks to] the number of customers who reside inside the market but leave that market to purchase goods and services."" "
1709,," Id. at 339-40. The Circuit recognized that this test is ""utilized in non-healthcare markets to define the relevant geographic 
market"" and even ""was once the preferred method to analyze the relevant geographic market,"" but ""subsequent empirical 
research demonstrated that [it] resulted in overbroad markets with respect to hospitals."" Id. Thus, the Circuit found this test to be 
""inconsistent"" with the hypothetical monopolist test, its preferred test for determining the relevant geographic market. Id. at 339. "
1710,12," Thus, if the Court was confronted with a proposed merger of Plaintiff and Defendants, then the relevant product market might 
very well be Medicare Part D because the Court would be viewing the issue from the consumer's perspective. The consumer's 
perspective was the relevant viewpoint in both Brown Shoe and Aetna. "
1712,13," The Circuit also discussed the price-cost test for predatory pricing, that is, ""pricing below an appropriate measure of cost for 
the purpose of eliminating competitors in the short run and reducing competition in the long run."" Id. at 272 (quoting Cargill, Inc. 
v. Monfort of Colo., 479 U.S. 104, 117, 107 S. Ct. 484, 93 L. Ed. 2d 427 (1986)). The court in ZF Meritor noted that ""Nile 
Supreme Court has expressed deep skepticism of predatory pricing claims."" Id. Ultimately, the Circuit determined that the price-
cost test was not the appropriate standard to apply because the plaintiff did not allege ""that the price itself functioned as the 
exclusionary tool,"" and instead turned to a rule of reason analysis. Id. at 281. Here, Plaintiff has not plausibly pled predatory 
pricing, so the Court foregoes a price-cost analysis. "
1714,14," By monopoly, the Court means that Plaintiff has not alleged that Defendants' glaucoma drugs do not face competition from a 
comparable substitute. "
1725,1," The Court presents the undisputed facts herein — as it must — in the light most favorable to the nonmovant. See, e.g., 
Theriault v. Genesis HealthCare LLC, 890 F.3d 342, 348 (1st Cir. 2018)."
1725,2," Over the course of this litigation Sire merged completely into Alifax. See Alifax II, 2019 WL 317638, at *1 n.3. Unless otherwise 
noted, the Court refers herein to both entities simply as ""Alifax."" "
1726,3," The iSED production units are specifically correlated to ""the Fabry-corrected Westergren result."" DSADF ¶ 146."
1726,4," The parties refer to the disputed code as both ""Version 104A"" and ""Version 1.04A."" For consistency, the Court will use the 
former."
1726,5," As further explained herein, the record shows that the Version 104A identifier may have been used for multiple early iterations 
of code, only one or some of which may have contained Alifax's purportedly proprietary constants. See, e.g., DSADF ¶¶ 175-
182; Frappa Decl. ¶ 3, ECF No. 171-7; Defs.' Mem. 25-26. Even a cursory review of the docket for this action reveals that source 
code related discovery has been fraught. Such discovery has continued for months after the parties filed their dispositive 
motions. The Court's conclusions herein, however, are based solely on the record as it existed when the parties' filed their 
motions. "
1727,6, Alifax no longer appears to contend that the iSED infringes on claim 9 of the '107 Patent. See PSDF ¶ 8. 
1728,7," As the Defendants correctly note, an invalid patent cannot be infringed, thus granting summary judgment on Counts I and II of 
its Counterclaim would be an alternative basis to grant summary judgment in its favor on Count I of Alifax's Second Amended 
and Supplemental Complaint. Defs.' Mem. 17."
1728,8," Alcor moves only on these two grounds for the purposes of summary judgment and reserves the right to assert other bases for 
invalidity at trial. "
1729,9," Alifax argues that it is in fact entitled to summary judgment concerning the sufficiency of any written description. Pl.'s Opp'n 8. 
As Alcor observes, tucking this request into an opposition memorandum is improper. The Court will not entertain Alifax's 
invitation. "
1730,10," Alifax has abandoned any claim that the Defendants misappropriated trade secrets concerning ""the means of creating the 
capillary channel in the plastic block or the use of screws with Teflon washers to connect the block to the Teflon tubing."" Pl.'s 
Opp'n 13 n.2."
1730,11," The Defendants argue, among other things, that Alifax has no evidence that the iSED ""uses"" the CPS trade secret it allegedly 
misappropriated. Use, however, is not required under RIUTSA. § 6-41-1(2)(i) (defining misappropriation to include acquisition by 
improper means)."
1730,12, The Defendants cite no law whatsoever in support of this argument. 
1731,13," The statement read: ""Assuming that this signal could be acquired, one would then have to convert the signal data into a value 
that correlates with that of a standard or modified Westergren test."" Bergeron Report ¶ 45, ECF No. 145-11. "
1733,14," This cause of action is alleged only against Alcor. See Second Am. & Suppl. Compl. ¶¶ 77-85. Furthermore, whatever its 
original strategy may have been, Alifax no longer alleges a separate theory of infringement based on the so-called ""2006 Source 
Code Module,"" a section of Alcor's code identifying Frappa as its author and stating ""Copyright: Alifax Tech."" See Pl.'s Opp'n 20; 
Defs.' Mem. 24. Alifax suggests that the 2006 Source Code Module is merely evidence of willfulness. Pl.'s Opp'n 20."
1733,15," As the First Circuit highlighted in Airframe Systems: ""Where, as here, the copyrighted work involves specialized subject matter 
such as a computer program, some courts have held that the ordinary observer is a member of the work's intended audience 
who possesses specialized expertise."" 658 F.3d 106 n.7 (quotation marks omitted). The First Circuit does not appear to have 
ironed the wrinkles out of this standard, but it is unnecessary to do so here."
1733,16," Put another way, de minimis copying is ""a technical violation of a right so trivial that the law will not impose legal 
consequences."" Ringgold v. Black Entm't Television, Inc., 126 F.3d 70, 74 (2d Cir. 1997); see also UpdateCom, Inc. v. FirstBank 
P.R., Inc., No. CIV. 10-1855 SCC, 2014 WL 346436, at *3 (D.P.R. Jan. 30, 2014) (finding ""11 lines of 5,000, or about 0.22%—
constituted de minimis copying in the absence of other evidence.""). "
1734,17," The document Alcor produced listing all the iSED instruments it sold to customers includes the software installed at the time of 
manufacture or ""as [of] the date of service, whichever is later."" DSADF Ex. A, Frappa Decl. ¶ 7. Alcor does not appear to 
genuinely dispute that until October 2013, iSED units were sold with some iteration of Version 104A installed, though it disputes 
whether Alifax's conversion constants were present in that software. See DSADF ¶ 182."
1734,18," The dates of these tests appear to predate all the so-called ""commit"" files submitted by Alcor from its code repository in an 
attempt to demonstrate that iSED units in March 2013 were not sold with an iteration of Version 104A that contained Alifax's 
constants. See Frappa Decl. ¶¶ 17-19."
1734,19," Frappa's affidavit in support of summary judgment is more confident and contends that the prototype ran software that did not 
include Alifax's constants. See generally Frappa Decl. "
1735,20," As the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts recently observed, ""The First Circuit has not decided whether the 
Noerr-Pennington doctrine is applicable to state law claims as a matter of federal law."" United Food & Commercial Workers 
Unions & Emp'rs Midwest Health Benefits Fund v. Novartis Pharm. Corp., No. 15-CV-12732, 2017 WL 2837002, at *9 (D. Mass. 
June 30, 2017), aff'd, 902 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2018)."
1735,21," Alcor cites a statement from this Court's ruling in In re Loestrin 24 Fe Antitrust Litig., 261 F. Supp. 3d 307, 338 (D.R.I. 2017), 
as support for its position. The Court stated, ""Generally, under the Noerr—Pennington doctrine, a Sherman Act violation cannot 
be predicated upon mere attempts to influence the passage or enforcement of laws."" Id. (quotation marks omitted). The Court 
did not specifically hold that Noerr-Pennington could not apply to state-law tort claims. Id. at 348. "
1739,1," Both UPMC-BMS and UPMC-HB do business as UPMC WorkPartners (hereinafter ""WorkPartners""). Amended Complaint 
(""Am. Compl."") ¶¶ 17 & 18. "
1741,2," Don Schmac (""Mr. Schmac"") is the Executive Vice President and co-owner of Premier. "
1744,3," WorkPartners contends that on March 3, 2015, it sent MCMC and Align Networks each a draft Master Services Agreement that 
was substantially the same as the MSA sent to Premier. UPMC CSUMF ¶¶ 105, 106. "
1748,4," The Live Concert Court specifically noted, however, that the Ninth Circuit has ""never expressly held that a plaintiff (and, more 
specifically, a plaintiff's expert economist) can define the relevant product market exclusively by reference to these 'practical 
indicia.'"" In re Live Concert Antitrust Litig., 863 F. Supp. 2d at 985. "
1749,5," Premier, however, fails to direct this Court to any Third Circuit case holding that non-quantitative Brown Shoe factors or the 
""practical indicia"" and/or ""real world evidence"" of the District of Columbia District Court, are sufficient to define a relevant market 
with or without an expert."
1749,6, This Court's Memorandum Opinion denying Defendants' motion to dismiss found at ECF 48.
1749,7," ""When an expert opinion is not supported by sufficient facts to validate it in the eyes of the law, or when indisputable record 
facts contradict or otherwise render the opinion unreasonable, it cannot support a jury's verdict."" In an antitrust case, an expert 
opinion generally must ""incorporate all aspects of the economic reality"" of the relevant market. See ZF Meritor, LLC v. Eaton 
Corp., 696 F.3d 254, 290 (3d Cir. 2012). "
1750,8," In his report, Premier's expert economist provides only one unsupported sentence stating his ""opinion"" that the market is 
western Pennsylvania. Fuhr Report, ECF 274, Ex. B, p. 3."
1750,9," Premier also suggests that the scope of the relevant geographic market is a question of fact, and therefore an issue for the jury. 
In U.S. Horticultural Supply v. Scotts Co., 367 Fed. App'x 305 (3d Cir. 2010), however, the Third Circuit affirmed summary 
judgment where the plaintiff failed to factually support its proposed geographic market. Id. at 311-312."
1750,10," Premier admits that it has developed provider panels for employers throughout Pennsylvania as well as for employers located 
in other stated, including New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee, Virginia and others. UPMC CSUMF ¶ 188. Moreover, 
Premier generated over 2,800 new employer panels between its termination by UPMC and early January 2017, for employers 
located in Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Ohio, Maryland and West Virginia. See UPMC CSUMF ¶¶ 211 & 212. "
1753,11, Premier has failed to do either in this instance.
1753,12," Premier failed to respond to ¶ 69 of MCMC's Concise Statement of Undisputed Material Facts, therefore it is deemed 
admitted. See LCvR 56(E). "
1755,13," This Court has already found that Premier has failed in its attempt to define the relevant product and geographic markets, and 
has also failed to show an antitrust injury. Further analysis of Premier's alleged Section 1 claims is purely academic. "
1756,14," Under the rule of reason, ""the plaintiff bears an initial burden . . . of showing that the alleged combination or agreement 
produced adverse, anticompetitive effects within the relevant product and geographic markets."" United States v. Brown Univ., 5 
F.3d 658, 668 (3d Cir. 1993). ""The plaintiff may satisfy this burden by proving the existence of actual anticompetitive effects,"" or 
defendant's market power. Id. ""If a plaintiff meets his initial burden of adducing adequate evidence of market power or actual 
anti-competitive effects, the burden shifts to the defendant to show that the challenged conduct promotes a sufficiently pro-
competitive objective."" Id. at 669. ""To rebut, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the restraint is not reasonably necessary to 
achieve the stated objective."" Id. "
1759,1," The ten Plaintiffs are Best Effort First Time, LLC; HMA, Inc.; AJ&R Petroleum, Inc.; Fuel Management, Inc.; Energy 
Management, Inc.; Duncan Services, Inc.; Japan Plus, Inc.; Japan Plus Two, Inc.; Japan Plus Four, Inc.; and Jamal & Luqman, 
Inc. (Am. Compl., ECF No. 14). "
1760,2," Unless otherwise noted, the Court takes the following facts from Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint (ECF No. 14) and accepts them 
as true. See Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94, 127 S. Ct. 2197, 167 L. Ed. 2d 1081 (2007) (citing Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 
550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007)). "
1762,3," Section 13(a) of the RPA, in relevant part, states: It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce, either directly or indirectly, to 
discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities of like grade and quality . . . where the effect of such 
discrimination may be substantially to lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce, or to injure, 
destroy, or prevent competition . . . ."
1762,15, U.S.C. § 13(a). 
1765,4," In their Motion, Plaintiffs list their proposed amendments by paragraph number. (Pls.' Mot. at 2-5). But some of those paragraph 
numbers and allegations do not line up with those in the proposed Second Amended Complaint. (Compare Pls.' Mot. ¶¶ 38-40, 
48-50, with 2d Am. Compl. ¶¶ 35-37, 45-46). Where they conflict, the proposed Amended Complaint controls, not the Motion's 
summary of the amendments. "
1771,1," For these statements about historical income, see Compl. ¶¶ 249, 254, 259, 262, 271, 274, 277, 281, 290, 293, 296, 299, 310, 
315, 322, 328, 337, 343, 349, 355, 359, 361, 365."
1771,2," For these allegations about future regulatory risk, see Compl. ¶¶ 263, 272, 275, 278, 282, 286, 291, 294, 297, 300, 304, 308, 
311, 316, 320, 323, 325, 329, 331, 338, 340, 344, 346, 350, 352, 356, 358, 362, 366. "
1772,3," Furthermore, even if the Amended Complaint could be reasonably read to allege that the omissions were misleading even if the 
challenged conduct was not unlawful, the complaint fails to allege with particularity why, absent any antitrust violation, such 
statements would be misleading. (See Dkt. No. 69 at 30 n.10; Dkt. No. 101 at 2.)"
1772,4," Mylan also contends in its opening brief that Plaintiffs improperly ""cut[] and past[ed]"" their allegations from a complaint in 
another case. (Dkt. No. 96 at 6-7.) However, Mylan's reply brief states that the other case involved ""a different complaint that 
had different allegations."" (Dkt. No. 101 at 3.) The Court thus considers any argument about the improper copying of these 
allegations to have been abandoned. In addition, Mylan briefly asserts that Plaintiffs fail to allege scienter with respect to these claims. (Dkt. No. 96 at 8-9.) But 
because ""a 'single, conclusory, one-sentence argument' [i]s insufficient to adequately raise an issue,"" LG Elecs., Inc. v. Wi-LAN 
USA, Inc., No. 13 Civ. 2237, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 99827, 2014 WL 3610796, at *3 n.3 (S.D.N.Y. July 21, 2014) (quoting Cuoco 
v. Moritsugu, 222 F.3d 99, 112 n. 4 (2d Cir. 2000)), the Court does not address it. "
1773,5," In support of their argument that they have sufficiently alleged an underlying antitrust violation to survive a motion to dismiss, 
Plaintiffs rely on the fact that a court overseeing an antitrust action challenging the same rebate scheme denied a similar motion 
to dismiss. (Dkt. No. 100 at 11 (citing In re EpiPen (Epinephrine Injection, USP) Mktg., Sales Practices & Antitrust Litig., No. 17 
MD 2785, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 209710, 2017 WL 6524839, at *12 (D. Kan. Dec. 21, 2017)).) Mylan contends that this antitrust 
case is not relevant, because the pleading standards for antitrust and securities actions differ. (Dkt. No. 101 at 3.) The particularity pleading requirement in securities actions clearly applies to the facts underlying scienter and the alleged fraud 
or conspiracy. See 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(b)(1)-(2); Gamm v. Sanderson Farms, Inc., No. 16 Civ. 8420, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9944, 
2018 WL 1319157, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 19, 2018). But Mylan cites no authority for the proposition that the particularity 
requirement also applies to the illegality of underlying misconduct, including the reasons the conduct had greater anticompetitive 
effects than procompetitive effects. See Menaldi, 164 F. Supp. 3d at 578 n.5 (declining to resolve whether ""in securities fraud 
actions premised on a failure to disclose underlying criminal conduct, the underlying conduct is subject to heightened pleading 
standards or plausibility pleading analysis""). But the Court need not resolve this question here. Regardless of the applicable pleading standard for antitrust misconduct 
nestled in a securities case, and in light of the fact that the Court bases its decision primarily on the substance of the complaint 
in this case, the Court considers the result in the In re EpiPen antitrust litigation as offering only persuasive support for the 
conclusion that Plaintiffs' allegations regarding the Sanofi rebate scheme sufficiently allege anticompetitive conduct to survive a 
motion to dismiss. "
1774,6," Heritage Pharmaceuticals Inc. is another pharmaceutical company, which sells some of the same generic drugs as Mylan and 
is alleged to have entered various price-fixing agreements with Mylan. (See, e.g., Compl. ¶¶ 125-26, 188-90.) "
1775,7," Plaintiffs also respond that Mylan's challenge to loss causation for misstatements made during this period is barred by the law 
of the case doctrine or Rule 12(g). (Dkt. No. 100 at 22.) A court, in its discretion, can decline to allow parties to relitigate ""issues 
expressly or impliedly decided earlier in the proceeding."" In re Initial Pub. Offering Sec. Litig., 544 F. Supp. 2d 277, 284 
(S.D.N.Y. 2008). And Rule 12(g) prevents a party that has made a Rule 12 motion from ""mak[ing] another motion under this rule 
raising a defense or objection that was available to the party but omitted from its earlier motion."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(g). As Mylan correctly notes, however, this particular question was not actually decided in the Court's previous opinion. (Dkt. No. 
101 at 6 n.3.) And notwithstanding Rule 12(g), ""[a]n amended complaint . . . entitles a defendant to raise substantive arguments 
aimed at 'judicial resolution of the controversy' in a new responsive pleading, even if those arguments were not raised in 
response to the original complaint."" In re Parmalat Sec. Litig., 421 F. Supp. 2d 703, 713 (S.D.N.Y. 2006). The Court will thus 
address this argument. "
1777,8," Mylan pointedly does not address ""scienter allegations concerning the EpiPen,"" contending that they ""do not apply"" to Malik, 
because his alleged misstatements concern only the generics segment and there are no allegations that he was involved with 
EpiPen products. (Dkt. No. 96 at 18 n.13.) Plaintiffs do not directly address this point, instead arguing that the Amended 
Complaint pleads scienter as to all Defendants for the EpiPen rebate scheme. (Dkt. No. 100 at 17.) Because allegations 
regarding Malik's scienter as to the EpiPen rebate scheme and generic drug price fixing substantially overlap, the Court 
addresses scienter as to both. Even assuming that Malik had involvement with EpiPen products, the Court concludes that 
Plaintiffs have failed to adequately plead scienter to establish Malik's primary liability for misstatements pertaining to EpiPen 
products. "
1778,9," Mylan's reply brief also raises ""additional reliability problems"" with ""Plaintiff's scienter allegations."" (Dkt. No. 101 at 8; see id. at 
9.) But Mylan's opening brief does not raise these arguments, or otherwise dispute that the allegations in the Amended 
Complaint as to Malik's involvement in the Doxy DR allocation are sufficient to raise a strong inference of scienter, if they could 
be properly considered. (See Dkt. No. 96 at 21 (""Plaintiff's allegations . . . do not create an inference of scienter against Mr. 
Malik because the Doxy DR allegations are based on the unadjudicated complaint filed by the CTAG."").) ""[A]rguments raised for the first time in reply should not be considered, because the plaintiff[] had no opportunity to respond to 
those new arguments."" Bertuglia v. City of New York, 839 F. Supp. 2d 703, 737 (S.D.N.Y. 2012). As such, the Court will not 
consider these ""additional reliability problems"" raised for the first time in Mylan's reply brief. "
1800,1," Ruston et al. v. Ford Motor Company et al., Case No. 2:18-cv-11108. "

1804,5," Ford and Bosch LLC essentially make the same arguments in their Motions to Dismiss (Doc # 28; Doc # 29). In certain sections 
however, Bosch LLC makes separate arguments, and the Court has addressed those accordingly. "
1807,6," Compare Doc # 1, Pg ID 11, 114, 121-122 with 40 C.F.R. § 86.1803-01. "
1810,7, This does not apply in actions involving the Lanham Act. 
1821,1," To survive a motion to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), Relators' Second Amended Complaint [#69] must ""state a 
claim to relief that is plausible on its face."" Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 
(2007). The court accepts all factual allegations in Relators' Second Amended Complaint [#69] as true and draws all reasonable 
inference in favor of Relators. See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678-79, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009)."
1821,2," People suffering from HoFH have limited or no ability to remove from their blood the ""bad cholesterol"" low-density lipoproteins 
(""LDL-C""). Id. ¶ 28, 30. If untreated, people with HoFH have extremely high LDL-C levels, typically between 500mg/dL and 1,000 
mg/dL. Id. ¶ 30. Patients with HoFH develop atherosclerosis, or narrowing and blockage of the arteries, as early as age ten. Id. 
HoFH patients are at extremely high risk of cardiovascular problems and many are at risk for serious cardiac events starting in 
their 20s. Id. If left untreated, life expectancy of people with HoFH is 33 years. Id. Historically, HoFH has been difficult to treat 
because traditional ""high cholesterol"" treatments are ineffective. Id. ¶ 33. "
1822,3," Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, or HeFH, is inherited from one but not both parents. Id. ¶ 35. The prevalence of 
HeFH is far more widespread than HoFH and is accepted to be around 1 in 500. Id."
1822,4," Patients with ""severe refractory hypercholesterolemia"" are patients with high cholesterol who did not respond to other 
cholesterol-reducing treatments. Id. ¶ 54."
1822,5, The roles of each Defendant alleged in the Second Amended Complaint [#69] are addressed later in this memorandum. 
1823,6," The United States noted that a qui tam action ""'may be dismissed only if the court and the Attorney General give written 
consent to the dismissal . . ..'"" Notice of Election to Decline Intervention 1 [#99] (quoting 31 U.S.C. § 3730(b)(1)). The "
1824,," government thus requested that, ""should either the Relators or the Defendants propose that this action be dismissed, settled or 
otherwise discontinued, this Court solicit the written consent of the United States before ruling or granting its approval."" Id. The 
Plaintiff States made a similar request. Notice of Election 2-3 [#110]. "
1825,7," Defendants have asserted that the court can take judicial notice of the exhibits attached to their memorandum because they 
are referenced in the complaint and are publicly available government documents. Joint Mem. 4 n.5 [#152]. Relators notified the 
court at the hearing on this motion that they have no objection to the court's consideration of these exhibits."
1825,8," Defendants argued at the hearing on this motion that they were not parties to the Settlement Agreement and do not agree to 
the factual basis underlying that settlement. Defendants may certainly address the underlying facts during this litigation, and the 
court makes no factual determination at this time. At this procedural juncture, the court considers the Settlement Agreement only 
to the extent that it makes the inference that Aegerion caused the submission of false claims more plausible. "
1826,9," LDL apheresis is a procedure for individuals with mortally high cholesterol, which, according to Dr. Rader, involves ""physical 
purging of the blood to remove LDL cholesterol. Patients have the 3-4-hour procedure involving two intravenous lines every one 
to two weeks. This procedure is very taxing on patients and treats the symptoms of the disease as opposed to the disease 
mechanism itself, and it is also costly. While apparently beneficial, the apheresis treatment merely delays the progress of the 
disease."" SAC ¶ 33 [#69]."
1826,10," At the hearing on this motion, Relators' counsel stated that they have the names of patients and doctors referenced in Charts 
A and B but did not include them in the complaint in order to maintain those individuals' confidentiality. Although the court could 
require Relators to amend their complaint to add this information, the court will not require Relators to do so in the interest of 
patient confidentiality. The court notes, as it did at the hearing, that this evidence can be addressed on summary judgment. "
1833,11," Because of the continuing proceedings against the other Defendants, this interlocutory order does not amount to a final 
judgment. Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b). In light of the United States' and the Plaintiff States' requests as to any dismissal, see Notice of 
Election to Decline Intervention [#99], Plaintiff [*44]  States' Notice of Election to Decline Intervention [#110], the court 
anticipates that, unless this order is subsequently revised, judgment as to Defendant Sheer will enter with prejudice as to the 
Relators and without prejudice as to the United States and the Plaintiff States. "
1845,1," For purposes of ruling on Defendants' motion to dismiss, the court treats the factual allegations of the Amended Complaint 
(Doc. # 29) as true, but not its legal conclusions. See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678-79, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 
(2009)."
1845,2," Though the Amended Complaint does not expressly state that the iTero is inserted into the patient's mouth, Plaintiffs filed an 
affidavit in support of their motion for a temporary restraining order representing to the court that it is. (Doc. # 3-4 at 5, ¶¶ 8-9). 
Additionally, other statements in the Amended Complaint strongly imply that the iTero is inserted into the patient's mouth. (Doc. 
# 29 at ¶ 95) (""The iTero is also easy to clean between uses and thus presents no meaningful risk of cross-contamination as 
long as the person performing the photography removes and discards the disposable cover and wipes the wand with a 
disinfecting wipe after each use.""). "
1851,3," Silver also held that removal of an action from state to federal court by state officials did not waive the officials' Eleventh 
Amendment immunity. 804 F.2d at 1214-15. That holding was later abrogated by Lapides v. Bd. of Regents of Univ. Sys. of 
Georgia, 535 U.S. 613, 122 S. Ct. 1640, 152 L. Ed. 2d 806 (2002). But Silver otherwise remains good law. "
1852,4," Plaintiffs concede as much with respect to their federal and state constitutional claims against the Board members. In their 
motion to dismiss, the Board members asked the court to dismiss all of Plaintiffs' individual-capacity claims. (Doc. # 33 at 29). In 
response to that motion, Plaintiffs argued only that their individual-capacity antitrust claims should go forward. (Doc. # 41 at 25). 
They did not dispute that their individual-capacity constitutional claims should be dismissed. (Id.). Thus, Plaintiffs have 
abandoned their non-antitrust individual-capacity claims by failing to address the Board members' arguments that they should be 
dismissed. See Chambers v. Cherokee Cty., 743 F. App'x 960, 962 (11th Cir. 2018). "
1853,5," See N.C. Dental, 135 S. Ct. at 1117-18 (Alito, J., dissenting). "
1856,6," Defendants have moved to dismiss Plaintiffs' claims pursuant to both Rule 12(b)(1) (lack of subject-matter jurisdiction) and Rule 
12(b)(6) (failure to state a claim). (Doc. # 32). HN27[
] Because Parker immunity is a waivable, nonjurisdictional affirmative 
defense, Bolt v. Halifax Hosp. Med. Ctr., 874 F.2d 755, 756 (11th Cir. 1989) (en banc), the court construes Defendants' request 
to dismiss Plaintiffs' Sherman Act claims as a motion under Rule 12(b)(6) rather than Rule 12(b)(1). "
1857,7," N.C. Dental is susceptible of two different readings concerning when state agencies must show active supervision to claim 
Parker immunity. On the first reading, if a state entity (even one controlled by active market participants) is engaged in 
anticompetitive conduct mandated by the express statutory instructions of the legislature, that entity need not establish Midcal's 
active-supervision requirement to claim Parker immunity. See Hoover, 466 U.S. at 569 (""Where the conduct at issue is in fact 
that of the state legislature . . . , we need not address the issues of 'clear articulation' and 'active supervision.'""). That reading is 
based on the fact that the statute the Board was enforcing in N.C. Dental said nothing about teeth whitening, a practice that did 
not exist when the statute was enacted. In other words, the Board in N.C. Dental had to show active supervision because the 
state had never expressly instructed it to prohibit teeth whitening by nondentists. But if the state had expressly instructed it to 
prohibit teeth whitening by nondentists, there would have been no need for the Board to show any further active supervision. On the other hand, N.C. Dental could instead be read broadly to mean that state agencies controlled by active market 
participants must always show active supervision to claim Parker immunity, no matter how clear and specific the statutory 
mandate they are enforcing is. But even on that reading, the N.C. Dental decision makes clear that a state agency controlled by 
active market participants can show active supervision by pointing to a ""decision by the State to initiate . . . the [specific 
anticompetitive conduct at issue]."" 135 S. Ct. at 1116. An express statutory mandate directing the active market participants to 
engage in the specific anticompetitive conduct at issue would surely qualify. The court need not pick between those two readings of N.C. Dental because, in either case, the result is the same. HN29[
] 
Whether the active-supervision requirement does not apply when a state agency controlled by active market participants is 
enforcing an express, specific statutory mandate of the legislature, or whether such a mandate satisfies the active-supervision 
requirement, the result is the same: the agency receives Parker immunity."
1857,8," The Board members would also have to show that the term ""supervision"" in Alabama Code § 34-9-7(a) requires a dentist's 
physical presence at the facility where the digital imaging is performed. "
1858,9," Of course, in this scenario, the Board members must also establish Midcal's clear-articulation requirement to receive Parker 
immunity. N.C. Dental, 135 S. Ct. at 1110. The court does not address that requirement at this time because the Board members 
cannot show active supervision on the limited Rule 12(b)(6) record. "
1886,1," Keurig, Inc. became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Defendant Keurig Green Mountain, Inc. in 2006, which merged into Green 
Mountain Coffee Roasters, Inc. on December 31, 2013. (TreeHouse AC 1 n.1.) I will refer to Defendant as Keurig throughout this 
Opinion & Order whether referring to Defendant, Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, or Keurig, Inc. unless otherwise noted. "
1887,2," The Rogers Amended Complaint was filed under seal; a redacted version was filed on the docket. (No. 14-CV-4242, Doc. 83.) 
The TreeHouse Amended Complaint was filed under seal; a redacted version was filed on the docket. (No. 14-CV-905, Doc. 86.) 
The DPP Amended Complaint was filed under seal; a redacted version was filed on the docket. (Doc. 237.) The IPP Second 
Amended Complaint was filed under seal; a redacted version was filed on the docket. (Doc. 238.) All references to documents 
filed on the docket are designated ""Doc."" and refer to the MDL Docket, No. 14-MD-2542, unless otherwise noted. "
1888,3," Although Keurig moves to dismiss the amended complaints in their entirety, its briefing does not address every cause of action 
specifically. In this Opinion & Order, I address only those causes of action that have been briefed by the parties. Arguments 
concerning causes of action not addressed in Keurig's briefing are considered waived, and those claims survive."
1888,4," Unless otherwise noted, the facts set forth herein are drawn from the allegations of the various amended complaints. I assume 
those allegations to be true for purposes of ruling on these motions. See Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A., 534 U.S. 506, 508 n.1, 
122 S. Ct. 992, 152 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2002). My references to these allegations should not be construed as a finding as to their 
veracity, and I make no such findings. In addition, this section is not an exhaustive review of the factual allegations made by the 
parties; rather, it merely provides a summary of the facts relevant to this case in general. Therefore, to the extent necessary, 
additional facts are elaborated upon in the legal discussion below."
1888,5," For ease of reference, this footnote and the five that follow establish unifying definitions for certain types of products and/or 
technologies that are referred to by varying terms across the four amended complaints. ""Single Serve Brewers"" refers to what 
Plaintiffs have referred to as ""Single Serve Brewers,"" (Rogers AC ¶ 9 (""pressurized hot water brewing equipment that is capable 
of brewing at least a single serving of coffee or other hot beverages"")), ""Single-Serve Brewers,"" (TreeHouse AC ¶ 3 
(""pressurized hot water brewing equipment that can be used to brew one or more servings at a time of coffee, tea, cider, hot 
cocoa, or other hot beverages or food products, such as soups and oatmeal, from a portion pack that is inserted into the 
brewer""); DPP AC ¶ 7 (""electronic low-pressure brewer which runs hot water through a disposable, single-use portion pack 
containing coffee and to a far lesser extent, other hot beverage components (like tea or hot chocolate) . . . to make beverages in 
small quantities (i.e., one or two-serving cups)"")), and ""Portion Pack Brewers,"" (IPP SAC ¶ 5 (""machines designed to be capable 
of brewing a variety of hot beverages, such as coffee, tea, and hot chocolate, in predefined portions from sealed portion 
packs""))."
1888,6," ""Portion Packs"" refers to what Plaintiffs have referred to as ""Portion Packs."" (Rogers AC ¶ 9 (""disposable cartridges, capsules, 
pods, or packs containing pre-measured beverage portions that are used in Single Serve Brewers to prepare a wide variety of 
beverages and food products""); TreeHouse AC ¶ 3 (""disposable cartridges, capsules, pods, or packs containing prepared 
beverage or food product portions that are used in Single-Serve Brewers to make a wide variety of beverages and food 
products""); DPP AC ¶ 7 (""disposable, single-use portion pack containing coffee and to a far lesser extent, other hot beverage 
components (like tea or hot chocolate)"").) Although the IPPs do not use it as a defined term, they refer to ""portion packs"" as 
""cartridges, disks, or cups"" that ""hold[] coffee grounds and other material for brewing hot beverages"" in a Single Serve Brewer. 
(IPP SAC ¶¶ 5-6.)"
1888,7," ""K-Cup Brewer"" refers to what Plaintiffs have referred to as ""K-Cup Brewers,"" (Rogers AC ¶ 9 (""Single Serve Brewers 
manufactured or licensed by Keurig for use with K-Cups""); TreeHouse AC ¶ 3 (same); DPP AC ¶ 9 (""Keurig's most popular 
Single-Serve Brewer"")), and ""Keurig Portion Pack Brewers,"" (IPP SAC ¶ 7). "
1889,8," ""K-Cups"" refers to what Plaintiffs have referred to as ""K-Cups,"" (Rogers AC ¶ 31 (""single-serve Portion Packs sold by Keurig 
under its brand name as well as those sold under its licensees' brand names""); TreeHouse AC ¶ 4 (""Compatible Cups that are 
made by, or under a license from, [Keurig]""); DPP AC ¶ 9 (""Portion Packs sold by Keurig under its brand name as well as those 
sold under its licensees' brand names"")), and ""Keurig K-Cups,"" (IPP SAC ¶ 9 (""Keurig Compatible Cups that are made or 
licensed by Keurig""))."
1889,9," ""Competitor Cups"" refers to what Plaintiffs have referred to as ""Competing Portion Packs,"" (Rogers AC ¶ 31 (""Portion Packs 
[compatible with K-Cup Brewers that are] manufactured, distributed and sold by Keurig's competitors"")), ""Competitive Cups,"" 
(TreeHouse AC ¶ 4 (""K-Cup-format Portion Packs made by [Keurig's] competitors""); IPP SAC ¶ 12 (""Portion packs made, 
distributed, or sold by Cup Competitors for use in Keurig Portion Pack Brewers"")), and ""Competitor Cups,"" (DPP AC ¶ 9 (""Portion 
Packs [that are compatible with K-Cup Brewers that are] manufactured, distributed and sold by Keurig Competitors""))."
1889,10," ""Compatible Cups"" refers to what Plaintiffs have referred to as ""Compatible Portion Packs,"" (Rogers AC ¶ 9 (""disposable pods 
or cups that are compatible with [K-Cup Brewers]"")), ""Compatible Cups,"" (TreeHouse AC ¶ 4 (""disposable pods or cups that are 
compatible with [K-Cup Brewers]""); DPP AC ¶ 9 (""Portion Packs that are compatible with the K-Cup Brewer"")), and ""Keurig 
Compatible Cups,"" (IPP SAC ¶ 8 (""The only type of portion packs that will work in the [K-Cup Brewer]"")). "
1893,11," I refer to Rogers and TreeHouse collectively as the ""Competitor Plaintiffs."""

Amended Class Action Complaint. (Doc. 232.) "
1898,19," Keurig also argues that the DPPs lack standing to bring claims related to the 2.0 Brewer because, in part, they do not allege 
they purchased the 2.0 Brewer and because, if the DPPs had issue with the limited choice of Compatible Cups afforded by the 
2.0 Brewer, they simply need not buy it. (DPP Def. Mem. 7-8.) However, the DPPs allege that Keurig engaged in a multi-
dimensional monopolization scheme designed to frustrate competition on the merits in order for Keurig to maintain, if not 
increase, the supra-competitive prices Keurig charges the DPPs for the K-Cups the DPPs purchased directly from Keurig. (DPP 
AC ¶¶ 245, 258.) Conduct related to the 2.0 Brewer is relevant to the DPPs' claims to the extent it allowed Keurig to maintain 
supra-competitive pricing. "
1899,20," I note that some courts analyze antitrust standing separately under Section 1 and Section 2. See In re Zinc Antitrust Litig., 155 
F. Supp. 3d 337, 360-65 (S.D.N.Y. 2016). Both Keurig and the IPPs conflate the analysis. (See IPP Def. Mem. 5-9; IPP Opp. 9-
13.) At any rate, I find that, for the same reasons that the efficient enforcer factors weigh against the IPPs' federal antirust 
standing under Section 2, they also weigh against the IPPs' federal antitrust standing under Section 1, and their Section 1 claims 
are also dismissed. "
1901,21," Keurig also argues that the DPP Amended Complaint lacks allegations concerning the 2.0 Brewer specifically. (DPP Def. 
Mem. 20-21.) These arguments are irrelevant to the definition of the Single Serve Brewer Market as all Keurig's Single Serve 
Brewers fit into this market definition, and the law does not require the DPPs to allege how much of that market is claimed 
specifically by the 2.0 Brewer."
1901,22," The DPPs define the Class Period as encompassing all persons or entities that purchased at least one K-Cup between 
September 7, 2010 and the present. (DPP AC ¶ 245.) "
1902,23," HN16[
] I also note that in Eastman Kodak, the Supreme Court expressly rejected ""adopt[ing] any exception to the usual 
antitrust analysis"" when assessing monopoly power in an aftermarket, noting that the Court has always ""treat[ed] derivative 
aftermarkets as it has every other separate market."" 504 U.S. at 479 n.29."
1902,24," The Competitor Plaintiffs allege that because Portion Packs that do not work in K-Cup Brewers are not interchangeable with 
Compatible Cups, the Compatible Cup Market ""is the appropriate relevant market in which to evaluate the harm caused by 
Keurig's unlawful and anticompetitive conduct to competition for the manufacturing, licensing, and sale of Portion Packs that 
compete with K-Cups, i.e., Competing Portion Packs."" (Rogers AC ¶ 54; see also TreeHouse AC ¶ 149.) For purposes of the 
current motion, it suffices that the Competitor Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged both Compatible Cup and Portion Pack Markets; 
discovery will illuminate which market is appropriate in which to analyze the alleged anticompetitive conduct. See Found. for 
Interior Design Educ. Research, 244 F.3d at 531. With respect to the DPPs, Keurig also argues that, because its competitors have enjoyed some growth, there is no dangerous 
probability of monopoly, an element for the claim of attempted monopolization. (DPP Def. Mem. 23-24.) This argument fails. 
First, the DPPs have adequately alleged direct evidence of Keurig's market power and its exercise thereof. (See, e.g., DPP AC ¶ 
103 (""Keurig has the power to exclude competition in the Single-Serve Brewer Market. Keurig has unlawfully exercised its power 
to exclude competition in the Single-Serve Brewer Market by coercing distributors and retail customers to enter into exclusive 
agreements, which require that only Keurig Single-Serve Brewers be sold or used by these entities."").) Further, the presence of 
limited competitor growth does not, as Keurig states, ""negate[]"" any attempted monopolization claim. See Berkey Photo, 603 
F.2d at 273 n.11 (""The precipitous decline [of defendant's market share is] not dispositive.""). HN17[
] As discussed further below, the law does not require a complete lack of growth to sustain a Section 2 claim. See Conwood Co. v. U.S. Tobacco Co., 
290 F.3d 768, 784 (6th Cir. 2002) (affirming monopoly maintenance where plaintiff's market share was increasing and market 
was expanding). "
1905,25," Keurig has cited no case law, and I have found none, in which a court finds a sham litigation claim to fail as a matter of law 
when a court of appeals grants oral argument on an appeal, especially where, as here, the only decisions on the merits were the 
summary judgment decision which admonished Keurig that ""patent holders may not invoke patent law to enforce restrictions on 
the postsale use of their patented products,"" Keurig, Inc. v. JBR, Inc., 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 73845, 2013 WL 2304171, at *15, 
and the decision by the Federal Circuit summarily affirming the district court's grant of summary judgment, 558 F. App'x 1009 
(Fed. Cir. 2014). "
1906,26," Although its allegations are sufficient, Rogers also alleges that the Patent Litigation was designed to and did slow Rogers' 
entry into the market by casting a pall of illegitimacy over the Rogers products. (See Rogers AC ¶ 172 (""Moreover, the lawsuits 
were used by Keurig to sow doubt and confusion amongst consumers about the viability of Competing Portion Packs. On 
information and belief, Keurig used the existence of the lawsuit in order to convince distributors and third parties to stop doing 
business with Rogers and Sturm."").)"
1906,27," HN25[
] As Keurig notes, substantial foreclosure is an element of an exclusive dealing claim whether that claim is brought pursuant to Section 1 or Section 2 of the Sherman Act, or Section 3 of the Clayton Act. (See Rogers Def. Mem. 9 n.9.; 
TreeHouse Def. Mem. 7 n.4; DPP Def. Mem. 8 n.8.) Keurig's anticompetitive exclusive dealing conduct supports the following "
1907,," claims raised by Rogers: claim 1 (monopolization); claim 2 (exclusive dealing); claim 3 (monopoly leveraging); claim 8 
(conspiracy to monopolize); claim 9 (conspiracy and group boycott); claim 10 (attempted monopolization); claim 12 (violation of 
the Cartwright Act); claim 13 (unfair competition); and claim 15 (violation of California's Unfair Competition Law). Additionally, 
TreeHouse alleges exclusive dealing in violation of Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, Section 3 of the Clayton Act, and 
Illinois, Wisconsin, and New York law. (TreeHouse AC ¶¶ 577-84.) "
1908,28," The cases cited by Keurig in support of its argument that any growth of a competitor is fatal, as a matter of law, to any claims 
of substantial foreclosure, are easily distinguishable on their facts. In CDC Technologies v. IDEXX Laboratories, Inc., which 
Keurig argues is ""fatal to all of [Rogers'] exclusive dealing claims,"" (Rogers Def. Mem 9), the court found, on a motion for 
summary judgment, that plaintiff failed to show that the exclusive distributorship arrangements at issue had an actual adverse 
effect on competition in the market. 186 F.3d 74, 80 (2d Cir. 1999). Unlike the court in CDC Technologies, the motions before 
me are motions to dismiss not motions for summary judgment. Moreover, Rogers here alleges clearly adverse effects stemming 
from Keurig's exclusive dealing arrangements. In Bowen v. New York News, Inc., after trial, the court determined that the 
defendant's exclusive agreements did not prevent alternative channels of access to the market. 366 F. Supp. 651, 679-80 
(S.D.N.Y. 1973), aff'd in part and rev'd in part on other grounds, 522 F.2d 1242 (2d Cir. 1975). Here, at this stage of the litigation, 
I need not consider whether or not their might be alternative channels of access to the market by the Competitor Plaintiffs."
1908,29," I note also that allegations of substantial foreclosure have been upheld where a plaintiff alleges exclusion from two retailers. 
See Commercial Data Servers, Inc. v. IBM Corp., No. 00-CV-5008, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5600, 2002 WL 1205740, at *7 
(S.D.N.Y. Mar. 15, 2002) (finding that plaintiff's allegations of foreclosure from two resellers ""may indeed be sufficient to 
substantially foreclose competition, depending on the particular facts relating to those resellers"" and denying defendant's motion 
to dismiss based on lack of alleged substantial foreclosure). "
1909,30," Keurig opposes TreeHouse's and the DPPs' substantial foreclosure claims related to the inputs of Compatible Cups—at least 
in part—by arguing that such claims require Plaintiffs to allege a numerator and denominator. For the reasons stated above, that 
argument is unpersuasive and I will not repeat my analysis here. "
1911,31," Keurig's argument that the DPPs concede the purported misstatements are susceptible to neutralization points only to 
allegations that Rogers, ""had the opportunity to take steps to neutralize many of the statements."" (DPP Def. Mem. 18.) This is 
insufficient to find, as a matter of law, that the statements were in fact susceptible to neutralization. "
1915,32," ""Roaster Nominated Keurig Authorized Distributors"" is defined by Keurig as ""'A company that was nominated by a Licensed 
Roaster and has an effective distribution agreement with Keurig that specifies a geographical territory and channels of 
distribution. These companies purchase Keurig Products from Keurig and exclusively the nominating Licensed Roaster's K-Cups 
from the nominating Licensed Roaster, KARDs, or Keurig for resale.'"" (Treehouse AC ¶ 303.)"
1915,33," Keurig also argues that the Competitor Plaintiffs' Section 1 claims fail because they do ""not allege that [they have] been 
injured from any alleged elevation in prices."" (Rogers Def. Mem. 24; see also TreeHouse Def. Mem. 12.) This argument fails. 
The Competitor Plaintiffs allege antitrust injury and even assuming that they may be able to enjoy the effects of Keurig's conduct "
1916,," that results in supra-competitive pricing for Compatible Cups—something for which there is no evidence—this supposed 
""benefit"" alone is insufficient to contradict the injury they allege. (See, e.g., Rogers AC ¶ 343 (alleging antitrust injury in the form 
of restraints entry, consumer choice, and incentives to create new products, among others); TreeHouse AC ¶¶ 549-64 (alleging 
antitrust injury in the form of restraints in output, consumer choice, incentives to create new products, and price competition).) 
See also N.Y. MedScan LLC v. N.Y. Univ. Sch. of Med., 430 F. Supp. 2d 140, 146 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) (finding that a plaintiff 
establishes antitrust injury ""by alleging adverse effects on the price, quality, or output of the relevant good or service""). In support 
of its argument, Keurig cites from Original Appalachian Artworks, Inc. v. Granada Electronics., Inc., 816 F.2d 68, 74 (2d Cir. 
1987) (""Artworks""). The district court in Artworks found, and the Second Circuit agreed, that Granada's business model was only 
feasible because of the allegedly artificially inflated prices in the United States, because Granada was buying the cheap goods in 
Europe and selling them at a profit in the United States. See Original Appalachian Artworks, Inc. v. Granada Elecs., Inc., No. 85 
Civ. 9064 (WCC), 1986 WL 2402 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 20, 1986), aff'd, 816 F.2d 68 (2d Cir. 1987). In other words, it was because of 
the allegedly artificially inflated prices that Granada was able to profitably conduct business. The Competitor Plaintiffs 
businesses would exist without Keurig charging supra-competitive prices. Keurig has not shown how the Competitor Plaintiffs' 
business model is comparable to the business model in that case, and Artworks therefore does not apply. "
1919,34," To the extent that Keurig argues that this claim should be dismissed because Rogers failed to allege under which state's laws 
it was asserting a claim for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage, I find this argument fails because it is 
clear from the context of the claim that Rogers asserts this claim under California law. I note that all other common law claims 
raised by Rogers are under only California law and that the original complaint was filed in California. Indeed, Keurig tacitly 
recognizes this because its argument for dismissal of this claim is based upon California case law. "
1922,35," Keurig also moves to dismiss the IPPs' claims brought under the laws of states where no named plaintiff was harmed, arguing 
that Mahon v. Ticor Title Ins. Co., 683 F.3d 59, 64 (2d Cir. 2012), requires dismissal on this ground. (IPP Def. Mem. 9-10.) 
HN65[
] The Court in Mahon did not hold that it was necessary in all cases to determine the standing issue prior to the class 
certification issue. See 683 F.3d at 65 (""As such, we think the Court's 'logical antecedence' language is relevant when resolution 
of class certification obviates the need to decide issues of Article III standing."" (citing Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 
591, 612, 117 S. Ct. 2231, 138 L. Ed. 2d 689 (1997))). Rather, Mahon preserved the logical antecedence exception to the 
general rule that Article III standing is a prerequisite to class certification. See Okla. Police Pension & Ret. Sys. v. U.S. Bank 
Nat'l Ass'n, 986 F. Supp. 2d 412, 419 n.3 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (explaining that the logical antecedence exception, while narrow, 
applies to ""nation-wide class actions in which claims [are] brought under parallel provisions of different states' consumer 
protection or antitrust laws""). In addition, Mahon held that a plaintiff does not have standing to bring a class action against 
defendants that did not injure her. 683 F.3d at 65. Here, in the case of both the DPPs and IPPs, each named plaintiff has alleged 
that he or she has suffered an injury-in-fact as a result of Keurig's conduct. (DPP AC ¶¶ 25-35; IPP SAC ¶¶ 37-63.)"
1922,36," For ease of reference and solely for this Opinion & Order, I refer to and include the District of Columbia as a ""state."" "
1923,37," ""IPP Def. Reply"" refers to the Memorandum of Law in Support of Defendant's Motion to Dismiss the Indirect Purchaser 
Plaintiffs' Second Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint, dated May 13, 2015. (Doc. 267.)"
1923,38," The states are Arizona, California, the District of Columbia, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, 
New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wisconsin."
1923,39," The states are California, the District of Columbia, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, North 
Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Vermont, and Wisconsin."
1923,40," The states are Arizona, Mississippi, Nevada, New Hampshire, and West Virginia. "
1924,41," The plaintiff classes in both Comes and Arthur were consumers who had purchased computers pre-installed with the Windows 
98 operating system. Comes, 646 N.W.2d at 441-42; Arthur, 676 N.W.2d at 31-32. As such, they were indirect purchasers of 
Windows 98 because they purchased the software indirectly through retailers or distributors rather than directly from Microsoft. 
Unlike the IPPs here, the plaintiff classes in Comes and Arthur had a direct relationship with Microsoft because they were end-
user licensees of Microsoft as to Windows 98. Comes, 646 N.W.2d at 441-42; Arthur, 676 N.W.2d at 32. Nevertheless, Comes 
and Arthur are sufficiently analogous to the facts here to create doubt as to how the highest courts in Iowa and Nebraska would 
apply the AGC factors to the IPP Second Amended Complaint. "
1926,42," HN69[
] Maine's Illinois Brick repealer statute, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 10, § 1104(1), provides a private antitrust treble damage remedy for any person injured either ""directly or indirectly in [his] business or property."" "
1928,43," Even if Fucile controlled, it would not support Keurig's position. The Fucile court clearly stated ""that the Vermont Supreme 
Court would also draw upon the standing factors in Associated General Contractors for guidance, at least to the extent that 
these factors are consistent with allowing 'indirect purchaser' standing."" Fucile, 2004 Vt. Super. LEXIS 42, 2004 WL 3030037, at 
*3. Applying the AGC factors to dismiss an indirect purchaser suit would be inconsistent with allowing standing to indirect 
purchasers. Even under Fucile, then, Keurig's position is unavailing. "
1929,44," The states are Arizona, Mississippi, Nevada, New Hampshire, and West Virginia. "
1930,45," Keurig did not include Minnesota, North Carolina, or Tennessee in Table B, which identified the states in which the AGC 
factors should be applied. I construe this omission as a concession that the IPPs have antitrust standing under the laws of 
Minnesota, North Carolina, and Tennessee. "
1933,46," Neither party has adequately addressed whether each state's consumer protection laws incorporate the principles of antitrust 
standing under either federal or state antitrust law. In a footnote, without citation, the IPPs assert that ""[e]ach of [the six state 
laws under which they bring consumer protection claims] allows indirect purchasers to bring antitrust claims under their 
consumer protection laws."" (IPP Opp. 15 n.17.) Keurig does not directly address this issue. Instead, Keurig cites to several 
cases to support the proposition that ""[w]here conduct is alleged to harm consumers through its impact on competition, the 
conclusion that it does not violate the antitrust laws means that it does not harm consumers."" (IPP Def. Mem. 27 (emphasis in 
original).) The IPPs in turn cite to several cases for the proposition that ""the laws of each of these six states are intended to be 
broadly construed to protect consumers and not to be limited by the reach of traditional antitrust concepts."" (IPP Opp. 15.) Only 
one of the cases cited by either party sheds light on whether any of the relevant states' consumer protection laws incorporate 
principles of antitrust standing. See Meijer, Inc. v. Abbott Labs., 544 F. Supp. 2d 995, 1008 (N.D. Cal. 2008). HN82[
] According to the California federal court in Meijer, in order to state a claim under the North Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act 
(""NCUTPA"") a plaintiff must allege: ""(1) an unfair or deceptive act or practice, or unfair method of competition, (2) in or affecting 
commerce, and (3) which proximately caused actual injury to the plaintiff or his business."" Id. (quoting Miller v. Nationwide Mut. 
Ins. Co., 112 N.C. App. 295, 435 S.E.2d 537, 542 (N.C. Ct. App. 1993)). The Meijer court applied a proximate cause standard to 
the plaintiff's NCUTPA claim. Id. (holding that the NCUTPA is a ""comprehensive law designed to include within its reach the 
federal antitrust laws"" (quoting L.C. Williams Oil Co., Inc. v. Exxon Corp., 625 F. Supp. 477, 481 (M.D.N.C. 1985)))."
1933,47," The states are Arizona, Arkansas, the District of Columbia, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, 
Mississippi, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, South Dakota, Vermont, and Wisconsin. "
1939,1," In the Response, Plaintiff requests oral argument. However, because the Court previously heard argument on Defendants' first 
motion to dismiss, further argument on the issues involved is not necessary."
1939,2," With leave of Court, Plaintiff filed an unredacted version of the Amended Complaint under seal. ECF No. [123]."
1939,3," The Court previously dismissed Plaintiff's claims asserted in Counts II, VIII, and IX based on preemption, and therefore, Plaintiff 
does not reassert those claims in the Amended Complaint. See Order, ECF No. [115]. "
1942,4," The Court notes that Defendants' challenge to the sufficiency of the allegations regarding market power appears to relate to the 
third element of an unlawful tying claim, while Plaintiff appears to understand the challenge as one relating to the fourth element. 
However, analysis of both elements requires a showing of market power. As such, the distinction is without a difference for 
purposes of the instant Motion. "
1944,5," The Court acknowledges that it accepted Defendants' argument at oral argument on the first motion to dismiss that the tortious 
interference claim rises and falls on the tying claim, see ECF No. [112] at 20; however, the Court did not base its ruling upon this 
argument, and therefore did not address it in its previous order, ECF No. [115]. "
