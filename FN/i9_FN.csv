24,1," Kingston alleges that Spex ""got nothing of value other than the ability to extract licensing fees from Kingston and other 
companies for claims it knew were invalid."""
24,2," In its Notice of Supplemental Authority, Kingston directed the Court's attention to the Opinion of the Federal Trade Commission 
in In re: 1-800 Contract, Inc., FTC No. 9372, Slip Op. at 12-16 (FTC Nov. 7, 2018) to argue that Actavis applies outside of the 
Hatch-Waxman context. Spex should come prepared to discuss this case at the hearing."
24,3," Kingston alleges Spex valued these licenses at over $10 million, and gave them to avoid an adjudication resulting in its claims 
being found invalid. See Amended Answer ¶ 3. "
31,1," The background of the parties' dispute and the resulting litigation (some of which we discuss further below) is set forth in this 
court's opinion addressing an earlier appeal in this matter. (Rincon EV Realty LLC v. CP III Rincon Towers, Inc. (2017) 8 
Cal.App.5th 1, 5–7 [213 Cal. Rptr. 3d 410] (Rincon I).) The plaintiffs are Rincon EV Realty LLC, Rincon ET Realty LLC and 
Rincon Residential Towers LLC. (Id. at p. 5.) The defendants are (1) CP III Rincon Towers, Inc. (CP III), (2) other “Carmel 
Partners” entities (Carmel Partners, Inc.; Carmel Partners, LLC; Carmel Management, LLC; and Carmel Partners Investment 
Fund III, L.P.), (3) U.S. Bank National Association (USB) as trustee for the Maiden Lane Commercial Mortgage-Backed 
Securities Trust 2008-1 (the Maiden Lane Trust), (4) the Maiden Lane Trust, and (5) Maiden Lane LLC. (Id. at pp. 6–7.) "
32,2," In their summary judgment motion, defendants also argued judgment in their favor was appropriate on the alternative ground of 
collateral estoppel. Judge Kahn did not reach that argument. Because we affirm on the ground addressed by Judge Kahn, we 
need not address defendants' argument that collateral estoppel provides an alternative basis for affirmance. "
33,3," California courts have stated the “‘better practice’ is for ‘the trial court [to] determine the equitable issues before submitting the 
legal ones to the jury’” (Hoopes, supra, 168 Cal.App.4th at p. 157) and have referred to this approach as the “‘“equity first” rule’” 
(Orange County Water Dist. v. Alcoa Global Fasteners, Inc. (2017) 12 Cal.App.5th 252, 355 [219 Cal. Rptr. 3d 474] (Alcoa)). But 
the same preclusion principle applies when the legal claims are decided first by a jury, i.e., the jury's findings are binding in the 
trial court's subsequent disposition of the equitable claims. (Hoopes, supra, at p. 157.)"
33,4," The situation is different when the government brings a UCL claim for civil penalties, historically a legal claim as to which there 
is a right to a jury trial. (Nationwide Biweekly Administration, Inc. v. Superior Court (2018) 24 Cal.App.5th 438, 454–455 [234 
Cal. Rptr. 3d 468], review granted Sept. 19, 2018, S250047.) "
36,5," Also incorrect is plaintiffs' assertion that this court's “mandate, after Rincon I and footnote 12, was to try the case on the legal 
claims with plaintiffs' jury demand granted.” As noted, we stated in footnote 12 that “the fact we reverse in part for lack of an 
enforceable jury waiver does not mean plaintiffs are necessarily entitled to a jury trial on their remaining legal claims.” (Rincon I, 
supra, 8 Cal.App.5th at p. 20, fn. 12, italics added.) "
42,1," R. Doc. 77. Before Dr. Morice filed a first supplemental and amending complaint (R. Doc. 64), Defendants had filed a motion to 
dismiss (R. Doc. 21) the original complaint (R. Doc. 1), to which Dr. Morice filed an opposition (R. Doc. 30), in further support of 
which Defendants filed a reply (R. Doc. 33), and in further opposition to which Dr. Morice filed a surreply (R. Doc. 36). The Court 
granted Defendants' motion to dismiss in part for Dr. Morice's failure to seek leave of court to proceed anonymously and directed 
Dr. Morice to file an amended complaint that disclosed his identity. R. Doc. 52. Dr. Morice did so in his first supplemental and 
amending complaint, which repeated verbatim the original allegations, but also added certain allegations relating to Defendants' 
denial of Dr. Morice's application for reappointment of privileges in obstetrics. R. Doc. 64. The Defendants' second motion to 
dismiss and Dr. Morice's response thereto largely repeat arguments made concerning the original motion to dismiss. The first 
supplemental and amending complaint supersedes the original complaint and moots the balance of the original motion to 
dismiss. Nevertheless, to the extent any arguments made concerning the original motion to dismiss are applicable to resolving 
the instant motion, the Court considers them here."

63,118," Defendants also assert that Dr. Morice waived his right to sue Defendants for ""any claims for libel, slander or damages as a 
result of good faith quality review and peer review activities"" in Article III of the Bylaws. R. Doc. 77-3 at 10. As with Article XVII 
immunity, though, the bar established in Article III applies only upon a determination of ""good faith,"" which cannot be made on

the extent necessary, the Court holds that there can be no constitutionally-protected property interest in lapsed privileges. 
Therefore, for this reason and the reasons stated for denying Dr. Morice's motion for partial summary judgment, see section 
III(B)(2), infra, the Court dismisses Dr. Morice's claim for violation of due process as to the denial of his reappointment of

69,1," The following recitation of facts is derived from Plaintiff's Complaint (ECF No. 1), as well as the parties' briefing on the Motion 
for Preliminary Injunction (ECF Nos. 10, 24, 27). Additionally, the Court gathered general background information from FTC v. 
Actavis, Inc., 570 U.S. 136, 133 S. Ct. 2223, 186 L. Ed. 2d 343 (2013). "
73,2," Neither does Hoye v. City of Oakland, 653 F.3d 835 (9th Cir. 2011) stand for the broad proposition that a party can successfully 
bring an as-applied pre-enforcement challenge to a statute under all circumstances. Rather, aside from articulating that a 
paradigmatic as-applied approach can be appropriate at least in the context of First Amendment jurisprudence, Hoye offers little 
support for Plaintiff's position and only further confirms that courts ""decline[] to entertain as-applied challenges that would require 
[them] to speculate as to prospective facts."" Id. at 859. "
74,3," Plaintiff's pre-enforcement as-applied challenge is also problematic because it may be construed as an attempt to extend a 
facial overbreadth challenge outside the First Amendment context. In theory, Plaintiff claims that the language of the law in 
question is overbroad because it may allow the government to enforce it unconstitutionally. See, e.g., Sabri v. United States, 541 
U.S. 600, 609, 124 S. Ct. 1941, 158 L. Ed. 2d 891 (2004) (""It would have been correspondingly clear that if Sabri was making 
any substantive constitutional claim, it had to be seen as an overbreadth challenge; the most he could say was that the statute 
could not be enforced against him, because it could not be enforced against someone else whose behavior would be outside the 
scope of Congress's Article I authority to legislate.""). But under Plaintiff's logic, any law regarding commerce passed by the 
California legislature would have to include language specifically limiting its application to within California. That simply cannot 
be the case, and Plaintiff cites to no authority indicating otherwise. Moreover, Sabri cautioned against overbreadth challenges 
applied outside the scope of the First Amendment and the Supreme Court has regularly declined to extend such an analysis to 
other constitutional challenges. Id. at 609-610. "
77,4," The Court acknowledges Plaintiff's reference to the recent case of Timbs v. Indiana, 139 S. Ct. 682, 687-89, 203 L. Ed. 2d 11 
(2019), which holds the Excessive Fines Clause is fully incorporated against the states. The Court need not and does not 
determine whether such incorporation revokes the deference otherwise afforded to the State to set penalties and fines. Because 
the Court finds Plaintiff's Excessive Fines claim is unripe, it need not consider the State's argument for deference. "
79,5," The State cites to In re Cipro Cases I & II, 348 P.3d 845, 61 Cal. 4th 116 at 149-150, 187 Cal. Rptr. 3d 632 (Cal. 2015), to 
support its contention that this language ""draws on established antitrust jurisprudence and the ex ante framework of pay-for-
delay jurisprudence."" This ""has directly generated"" language does not appear in Cipro. "
80,6, The Court has no way of knowing how immediate AB 824 enforcement may be after entry of settlement. 
84,1," The first item on the checklist Tagtmeier completed personal indicates that he did not have any ""professional, social, or other

added)."
84,2, FINRA stands for Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. See Dkt. 13-16. 
85,3," Judge Reavley, joined by Judge Wiener, Garza, Benavides, and Stewart, dissented, stating that the Fifth Circuit ""may not 
overrule a decision of the Supreme Court""—Commonwealth Coatings, which Judge Reavley interpreted as requiring disclosure if 
there are ""dealings that might create only an impression of possible bias."" 476 F.3d at 287 (Reavley, J., dissenting). He noted "
86,," that Commonwealth Coatings had ""not been well received by some of the circuit courts"" and that the majority's holding ""might be 
on a bit firmer ground . . . [i]f circuit courts could overrule the Supreme Court."" Id. Judge Reavley disagreed with those courts 
that treated Commonwealth Coatings as a plurality or plurality-plus opinion because he believed that the concurrence was not 
inconsistent with the majority opinion. Id. at 288. This court, or course, cannot overrule a Fifth Circuit opinion and must follow the 
majority's interpretation of Commonweath Coatings. Thus, to the extent the Texas caselaw and language from Commonwealth 
Coatings relied upon by Carlson runs contrary to the Positive Software Solutions majority's interpretation of the Supreme Court's 
holding, it is inapposite. "
89,4," The Promissory Note states that Carlson ""agrees to pay to the order of [CSS] . . . the principal amount,"" which would be made 
on the last day of the first payroll period of each month for 108 months. Dkt. 13, Ex. 14 at CS 000211. It further states that if 
Carlson ""cease[d], for any reason, to be an employee of [CSS] or one of its affiliates, the principal amount then outstanding and 
accrued but unpaid interest thereon shall become immediately due and payable."" Id. "
91,5," FINRA Rule 2010 ""requires members, in the conduct of their business, to observe high standards of commercial honor and just 
and equitable principles of trade. Rule 2010 protects investors and the securities industry from dishonest practices that are unfair 
to investors or hinder the functioning of a free and open market, even though those practices may not be illegal or violate a

99,3," Prior to RMLC filing its Motion to Compel, GMR had already agreed to comply with RFP No. 19. (Joint Stip. at 47; McIntyre 
Decl. J 16). Thus, RMLC's request to compel compliance with RFP No. 19 is DENIED AS MOOT. "
105,1," Apotex seeks punitive damages solely in connection with its contract claims. See ECF No. 87, at 2 n.2. Thus, the Court need 
not and does not address Hospira's motion to the extent that it seeks dismissal of a claim for punitive damages under the 
FDUTPA. "
106,2," Hospira also contends that Apotex fails to allege antitrust injury and, by extension, antitrust standing. See Defs.' Mem. 8-10; 
ECF No. 88 (""Defs.' Reply""), at 2-3 & 3 n.5. Despite its name, antitrust standing is ""not jurisdictional in nature but rather relates 
to the merits of a claim."" Bilinski v. Keith Haring Found., Inc., 96 F. Supp. 3d 35, 43 n.7 (S.D.N.Y. 2015). Accordingly, the Court 
need not and does not address it here. See, e.g., Biocad JSC v. F. Hoffmann-La Roche, Ltd., 942 F.3d 88, 94 n.5 (2d Cir. 2019). "
113,1," The District's Memorandum in Support of its Motion is docketed separately. (See Doc. 14-1, ""Memo."") "

opportunity to rule properly."") (quoting Payne v. Payne, 12 Ariz. App. 434, 435, 471 P.2d 319 (1970)). And although Berry 
suggests his actions could have rightfully been undertaken by a certified legal document preparer (CLDP), see Ariz. R. Sup. Ct. 
31(d)(24) (recognizing that a CLDP may perform services in compliance with Part 7, Chapter 2, of the Arizona Code of Judicial 
Administration), Berry admits he is not a CLDP, and the court found he was not a CLDP at the relevant time. "

Ariz. 69, 73, 887 P.2d 599 (App. 1994)). Although Berry contends Rule 31 ""outlaw[s]"" commercial speech because it bans 
lawyer advertising, nothing in the text of the rule supports such an interpretation. Nor does he cite any authority suggesting he 
has a constitutional right to give legal advice in contravention of our supreme court rules prohibiting disbarred attorneys from 
practicing law."
152,5," In conjunction with this argument, Berry argues Rule 31 creates an illegal monopoly that only ""promote[s] lawyer income and 
eliminate[s] competition [between lawyers and nonlawyers]."" See 15 U.S.C. § 2 (designating the monopolization of trade or 
commerce as a felony offense); see also A.R.S. § 44-1403. Berry does not, however, suggest the State Bar controls pricing for 
legal services or that he, as a disbarred attorney, is a lawful competitor in the market for legal services. See Pasco Indus., Inc. v. 
Talco Recycling, Inc., 195 Ariz. 50, 57-61, ¶¶ 22-49, 985 P.2d 535 (App. 1998) (explaining how the elements of a monopolization

Election Board, http://ok.gov/elections/support/20161108_seb.html (last visited Nov. 13, 2019). The ballot title for State Question 792 provided: This measure repeals Article 28 of the Oklahoma Constitution and restructures the laws governing alcoholic beverages 
through a new Article 28A and other laws the Legislature will create if the measure passes. The new Article 28A provides that with exceptions, a person or company can have an ownership interest in only one area of 
the alcoholic beverage business--manufacturing, wholesaling, or retailing. Some restrictions apply to the sales of 
manufacturers, brewers, winemakers, and wholesalers. Subject to limitations, the Legislature may authorize direct 
shipments to consumers of wine. Retail locations like grocery stores may sell wine and beer. Liquor stores may sell products other than alcoholic beverages 
in limited amounts. The Legislature must create licenses for retail locations, liquor stores, and places serving alcoholic beverages and may 
create other licenses. Certain [***6]  licensees must meet residency requirements. Felons cannot be licensees. The Legislature must designate days and hours when alcoholic beverages may be sold and may impose taxes on sales. 
Municipalities may levy an occupation tax. If authorized, a state lodge may sell individual alcoholic beverages for on-
premises consumption but no other state involvement in the alcoholic beverage business is allowed. With one exception, the measure will take effect October 1, 2018."
170,3," Article 28A, § 2(A)(4) provides the same direction to winemakers: Winemakers either within or without this state may sell wine produced at their wineries to any licensed wholesaler who 
desires to purchase the wine; provided, that if a winemaker elects to sell the wine it produces to multiple wholesalers, then 
such sales shall be made on the same price basis and without discrimination to each wholesaler. In addition to its sales 
through one or more licensed wholesalers, a winemaker may be authorized to sell its wine as follows . . . . "
171,4," On July 15, 2019, the ABLE Commission published the top 25 brands of wine and liquor. Southern Glazer's Wine and Spirits of

the exclusive distributor of the other eleven top 25 brands."
171,5," SB 608 also sets out how the ABLE Commission determines what liquor or wine brand constitutes a ""top brand"": ""Top brand"" shall mean those brands constituting the top twenty-five brands in total sales of spirits and of wine [***8]  by all 
wholesalers during the past twelve-month period, according to the records of the ABLE Commission as revised by the 
ABLE Commission quarterly. In order to allow the ABLE Commission to determine the top twenty-five brands of spirits and 
of wine, all wholesalers must submit to the ABLE Commission every sixty (60) days a sworn affidavit listing their top thirty 
brands of spirits and of wine in sales for the previous sixty (60) days, excluding sales to wholesalers. Id. The ABLE Commission's list of the top 25 brands of wine and liquor is as follows: Barefoot Moscato Barefoot Pink Moscato Barton Vodka 80 Proof Beringer White Zinfandel Burnetts Crown Royal Vodka Evan Williams Black 7 Fireball Cinnamon Franzia Chardonnay Years Whiskey Franzia Chillable Red Franzia Crisp White Franzia Fruity Red Sangria Franzia Merlot Franzia Sunset Blush Franzia White Zinfandel "

174,6," For example, the Legislature prohibited price discrimination to wholesalers only ""when that manufacturer has not designated a 
single wine and spirits wholesaler."" Id. § 3-123(A)(1). Similarly, the Legislature provided the post and adjust price-posting system 
would not apply to a manufacturer that has a designated wholesaler to sell its products in the state. Id. § 3-116(D); § 3-116.1(A). "

exclusive rights, privileges, or immunities within this State."" "
176,10," HN13[
] The plain language of SB 608 further shows that the statute is not an operation of the Legislature's power to combat anticompetitive markets pursuant to Okla. Const. art. V, § 44. SB 608 does not define an unlawful restraint of trade nor does it 
set forth any punishment for those entities engaging in unlawful restraint of trade. Id. Further, SB 608 only deals with the top 25 
brands of liquor and wine as determined by the ABLE Commission every quarter. To apply the State's argument beyond the top 
25 brands specified in SB 608, the statute would allow for a restraint of trade on thousands of other brands of liquor and wine. If 
SB 608 was an anticompetitive measure, it would logically restrict anticompetition on all brands of liquor and wine."

of the times, and the prevailing sentiments among the people. Every constitution has a history of its own, which is likely to be 
more or less peculiar; and unless interpreted in the light of this history is liable to be made to express purposes which were 
never within the minds of the people in agreeing to it. This the court must keep in mind when called upon to interpret it; for their 
duty is to enforce the law which the people have made, and not some other law which the words of the constitution may possibly 
be made to express. Thomas v. Reid, 1930 OK 49, ¶ 39, 142 Okla. 38, 285 P. 92 (citation omitted). See also Wall v. Marouk, 2013 OK 36, ¶ 4, 302

187,8," Article 9, § 45 states, in part, that no association or corporation engaged in the production, manufacture, distribution, or sale of

wholesaler, must sell its products on the same price basis and without discrimination to all on-premise and off-premise 
licensees, unless otherwise provided by law."" Thus, whether or not SB 608 remains in effect, wine and spirit manufacturers 
already have no control regarding the sale and distribution of their products to the retail tier in Oklahoma as every wholesaler 
""must sell its products on the same price basis and without discrimination"" to retailers. It is essential to keep this in mind to the 
extent it is relevant to contemplate whether SB 608 deprives manufacturers (i.e., that small fraction of one percent of 
manufacturers subject to SB 608, see n.15, infra) of anything of value in the distortions of the highly-regulated three-tier market,

That is, only after ""hold[ing] SB 608's infringement of Article 28A, § 2(A)(2) is unconstitutional,"" Maj. Op., ¶ 17, does the Majority

Majority's analysis here; in my view, the meaning of Article 28A, § 2(A)(2) must be discerned from a reading of the entire 
instrument of which it is a part, and only then can any conclusion be reached as to whether SB 608 is inconsistent with the

188,13," This legal standard is, of course, not relaxed at the summary judgment stage. In Lafalier v. Lead-Impacted Communities 
Relocation Assistance Trust, 2010 OK 48, 237 P.3d 181, the Court explained that even at the summary judgment stage, ""there is 
a presumption that every statute is constitutional. The party seeking a statute's invalidation as unconstitutional has the burden to

189,17," For example, as to wine and spirits, 37A O.S. Supp. 2019 § 3-101(A) allows ""the possession and transportation of alcoholic

paid thereon,"" but otherwise states that ""[n]o person shall manufacture, rectify, sell, possess, store, import into or export from 
this state, transport or deliver any alcoholic beverage except as specifically provided in the Oklahoma Alcoholic Beverage 
Control Act."" (Emphasis added.) This is yet one more restriction which well distinguishes the alcohol industry from other 
industries. While markets in surrounding areas and states can be examined by individuals and businesses shopping, for 
example, for an automobile, it would be illegal for Oklahoma retailers to shop for wine or spirits outside Oklahoma's borders, and 
it would be impracticable for most Oklahoma consumers to travel a great distance to shop for a bottle of wine for personal use."
189,18," Maj. Op., ¶ 5 n.4."
189,19," Although not essential to my reasoning, it is useful to note that, generally, ""[i]t is the existence of monopoly power coupled with 
the intent to use it for anticompetitive purposes or with inevitable anticompetitive effects that establishes the offense of 
monopolization."" Bd. of Regents of Univ. of Okla. v. Nat'l Collegiate Athletic Ass'n, 1977 OK 17, ¶ 17 n.26, 561 P.2d 499 
(emphasis added). See also Beville v. Curry, 2001 OK 1, ¶ 1 n.1, 39 P.3d 754 (""Monopoly power is defined [in the Oklahoma 
Antitrust Reform Act] as the power to control market prices or exclude competition.""). When obscure and less popular brands are 
sold by only one wholesaler, there are no inevitable anticompetitive effects as the thousands of less popular brands do not have 
the same power to control market prices and exclude competition as do the most popular brands, and a retailer can, for 
example, simply opt not to purchase a less popular brand and replace it with another lesser-known brand sold by another 
wholesaler. However, the business of many retailers is likely dependent on having some, if not all, of the most popular brands in 
stock, brands that can currently be obtained from only one wholesaler. "
190,20," Regarding the importance of examining, in uncertain cases, ""the effects and consequences"" and ""the right being vindicated in 
the end,"" the Court in State v. State Board of Equalization, 1924 OK 682, 107 Okla. 118, 230 P. 743, stated that ""[i]t has been 
well said"" that [n]o feature of the judicial function is of equal dignity with that which requires dealing with what is and what is not 
really a part of the Constitution, or those things which may have been engrafted upon the original instrument. None requires an 
equal degree of care to reach a right conclusion, and courage to pronounce it. The court may, and should, and must, on such 
great occasions, look to the effects and consequences. Not to do so with the thought of hesitation, much less omission to do 
what duty to the public requires; but as an inspiration to reach the highest attainable degree of certainty of the right being 
vindicated in the end."
190,21," The Majority questions whether SB 608 could even be viewed as an attempt by the Legislature ""to combat anticompetitive 
markets pursuant to Okla. Const. art. V, § 44"" because SB 608 does not ""set forth any punishment for those entities engaging in 
unlawful restraint of trade,"" ""does not define an unlawful restraint,"" and ""only deals with the top 25 brands of liquor and wine[.]"" 
Maj. Op., ¶ 20 n.10 (emphasis in original). However, the Oklahoma Alcoholic Beverage Control Act, at the very least, does 
provide a punishment for ""[a]ny person who shall violate any provision of the Oklahoma Alcoholic Beverage Control Act for which 
no specific penalty is prescribed[.]"" 37A O.S. Supp. 2018 § 6-125(A). Further, SB 608 does, in my view, define an unlawful 
restraint -- i.e., in the Legislature's wisdom, the definition comprises manufacturers of top brands that sell their wares to one, and 
only one, wholesaler while refusing to sell to any other wholesaler who desires to buy those top brands. Further, it appears the 
Majority is asserting that a true anti-monopoly regulation would apply to all manufacturers, even manufacturers of the most 
obscure, boutique, or small-batch varieties of wines and spirits; however, in my view, not only, as a practical matter, would 
manufacturers of far less popular brands potentially not have sufficient product to sell to multiple wholesalers, but, more to the 
point, such a regulation would be targeting brands that have no potential anticompetitive effects. See n.19, supra. Finally, the 
Legislature's power is, in my view, not limited to an isolated reading of Article 5, § 44; instead, it fundamentally arises from its 
broad regulatory powers in the area of alcohol sales, a power which, moreover, is coupled with the anti-monopoly provisions, 
including the prohibition of monopolies set forth in Article 2, § 32, as well as the command and legislative duty set forth in Article 
5, § 44."

error by amending the statute.""). "
191,23," In Fent v. Fallin, 2014 OK 105, 345 P.3d 1113, the Court stated: Constitutional provisions are not made for parsing by lawyers, but for the instruction of the people and the representatives of 
government, so that they may read and understand their rights and duties. Words used in a constitutional provision and an 
accompanying ballot title are to be construed in a way most familiar to ordinary people who voted on the measure. Id. ¶ 12 (footnotes omitted). ""The ballot title is a contemporaneous construction of the constitutional amendment and weighs 
heavily in determining its meaning."" Id. (emphasis added) (footnote omitted). Thus, the Fent Court stated: ""With this guidance in 
mind, the issue becomes what would the ordinary person who voted on [the state question at issue], as explained by its ballot 
title, understand they were approving[.]"" Id. ¶ 13. See also McDonald v. City of Chicago, Ill., 561 U.S. 742, 828-29, 130 S. Ct. 
3020, 177 L. Ed. 2d 894 (2010) (""When interpreting constitutional text, the goal is to discern the most likely public understanding 
of a particular provision at the time it was adopted,"" and the focus is on ""what the public understood the words chosen by the 
draftsmen to mean."")."
191,24," In my view, even an isolated reading of these sentences is less than persuasive regarding a right on the part of manufactures 
to sell to a designated wholesaler that is completely ""free from legislative interference."" As I read it, the purpose of the second 
sentence, for example, is to prevent certain monopolistic tendencies. The only explicitly mandatory language in the two 
sentences -- certainly the only use of the word ""shall"" -- is the prohibition of discriminatory pricing contained in the second 
sentence: ""[I]f a manufacturer . . . elects to sell its products to multiple wholesalers, such sales shall be made on the same price 
basis and without discrimination to each wholesaler[.]"" Okla. Const. art. 28A, § 2(A)(2) (emphasis added). This language, as 
indicated above, directly alludes to and mirrors Article 9, § 45 of the Oklahoma Constitution, which is entitled ""Monopoly or 
destruction of competition -- Discrimination prohibited."" Indeed, other courts have explained that the three-tier system itself is 
structured so as to ""prevent[] . . . monopolistic tendencies . . . ."" S.A. Discount Liquor, Inc. v. Texas Alcoholic Beverage Comm'n, 
709 F.2d 291, 293 (5th Cir. 1983). In an Oklahoma case confronting language no longer in effect but very similar to that found in 
Article 28A, including a ""require[ment] [that] a manufacturer . . . sell to every licensed wholesaler on the same price basis and 
without discrimination,"" ""prohibitions against financial assistance from any manufacturer or wholesaler to any retailer,"" 
""prohibitions against price discrimination against wholesalers or retailers,"" and a ""constitutional amendment . . . require[ing] each 
manufacturer to sell to every licensed wholesaler on the same price basis and without discrimination,"" the Court stated that ""[i]t 
is apparent on the face of all these sections that their general purpose is the prevention of any tendency toward monopoly, or the 
control of the industry by any segment or special interest group, with the resulting destruction of competition."" Parham, 1966 OK 
9, ¶ 16, 412 P.2d 142. Therefore, in my view, the reason for the existence of the above-quoted sentence from Article 28A, § 
2(A)(2) is the prevention of monopolistic tendencies, not the enshrinement of monopoly power. This language, in my view, is 
aimed at only those scenarios involving sales ""to multiple wholesalers"" simply because it would be illogical if its requirement (i.e., 
that such sales shall be made on the same price basis and without discrimination to each wholesaler) sought to embrace other 
scenarios. Thus, Appellants justifiably assert that the purported right on the part of manufacturers to sell to only one wholesaler 
completely free from legislative interference would constitute a proverbial ""elephant in a mouse hole."" See, e.g., Whitman v. Am. 
Trucking Ass'ns, Inc., 531 U.S. 457, 468, 121 S. Ct. 903, 149 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2001) (""Congress, we have held, does not alter the 
fundamental details of a regulatory scheme in vague terms or ancillary provisions -- it does not, one might say, hide elephants in 
mouseholes. Respondents' textual arguments ultimately founder upon this principle."" (citations omitted)); see also Dep't of 
Commerce v. N.Y., 139 S. Ct. 2551, 2602, 204 L. Ed. 2d 978 (2019) (Alito, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)

transfer venue pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1404(a) is dispositive or non-dispositive. Compare, e.g., id. (concluding that ""a motion to 
transfer is not the functional equivalent of an order of dismissal"" and, thus, ""not a dispositive motion for purposes of § 636(b)(1)"" 
(internal quotation marks omitted)) with Payton v. Saginaw Cty. Jail, 743 F. Supp. 2d 691, 693 (E.D. Mich. 2010) (concluding 
that the grant of a motion to transfer is dispositive because it ""is the functional equivalent of a dismissal of the case — albeit 
without prejudice — in that forum""). Insofar as appears, the First Circuit has not directly addressed the point. But see Subsalve 
USA Corp. v. Watson Mfg., Inc., 462 F.3d 41, 47-48 (1st Cir. 2006) (holding that an order effecting the transfer of an action 
pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1631 was not immediately reviewable as a final decision of the district court because it did ""not 
terminate the litigation on the merits but, rather, ensure[d] its continuation in a different forum"" (footnote omitted)). In an 
abundance of caution, I have treated the instant motion as dispositive."

209,2," The Merger Guidelines, while not binding on courts, offer persuasive guidance in examining competitive effects. See Heinz, 
246 F.3d at 716 n.9. They also recognize that a SSNIP may be ""larger or smaller than five percent"" based on industry specifics, 
§ 4.1.2, but the FTC's uncontested position is that a SSNIP of ""about five percent"" is appropriate. PPFFCL at 2 ¶ 5."
209,3," ""The Brown Shoe practical indicia may indeed be old school, and its analytical framework relegated 'to the jurisprudential 
sidelines.' But Brown Shoe remains the law, and this court cannot ignore its dictates."" FTC v. Sysco Corp., 113 F. Supp. 3d 1, 27 
n.2 (D.D.C. 2015) (quoting FTC v. Whole Foods Market, Inc., 548 F.3d 1028, 1059 (2008) (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting)) 
(cleaned up)."
209,4," The 2010 Merger Guidelines' reference to swinging postdates the very few cases that have considered supply-side substitution, 
so those cases do not reference the three swinging requirements. Nonetheless, the case law is generally consistent with them. 
See, e.g., Brown Shoe, 370 U.S. at 366-68 (Harlan, J., dissenting in part, concurring in part) (swinging between women's and 
men's shoes); United States v. Colum. Steel Co., 334 U.S. 495, 510-11, 68 S. Ct. 1107, 92 L. Ed. 1533 (1948) (swinging 
production of different rolled steel products); Rebel Oil, 51 F.3d at 1436 (swinging between offering full-service and self-serve 
gasoline); Virtual Maint., Inc. v. Prime Comput., Inc., 11 F.3d 660, 665 (6th Cir. 1993) (swinging between computer systems with 
and without software updates included); FTC v. Elders Grain, Inc., 868 F.2d 901, 907 (7th Cir. 1989) (swinging between 
variations of industrial dry corn); cf. FTC & DOJ Horizontal Merger Guidelines §§ 1.32-1.322 (1997) (describing similar 
parameters for defining aggregate product market based on supply side substitution). "
210,5," Defendants also argue that swinging is not nearly universal because the hydrogen peroxide manufacturing process limits 
suppliers from swinging 100 percent of their capacity to specialty or pre-electronics grade hydrogen peroxide. See DPFFCL at 
25 ¶ 74; id. at 32 ¶ 87. While this may distinguish swinging in the hydrogen peroxide industry with swinging from the Fourdrenier 
paper machine, not all capacity necessarily needs to swing into a substitute market in order to constrain anticompetitive prices. 
To constrain prices for specialty or pre-electronics grade hydrogen peroxide, a minority of the overall hydrogen peroxide market, 
see Rothman Hrg. Tr. 755:21-25, suppliers need only purify a fraction of their standard grade hydrogen peroxide. "
211,6," An earlier version of the Merger Guidelines—which does not use the word ""easy"" to describe product market definition by 
supply substitution—suggests that swinging into the ""production and sale of the relevant product"" must take place ""within one 
year"" in response to a SSNIP in the relevant product. Merger Guidelines § 1.321-1.322 (1997); see also id. § 1.321 n.14. "
212,7," [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] See DPFFCL at 25-26 ¶¶ 72, 75."
212,8," An internal Evonik document could be construed to suggest that Evonik considers PeroxyChem and Solvay competitors for 
pre-electronics grade H2O2, see PPFFCL at 12 ¶ 35 (citing PX1156-010), but the better reading of that chart is that it represents 
the entire electronics market, with Arkema and Evonik's slices meant to signify the pre-electronics hydrogen peroxide they 
supply to MGC. See DPFFCL at 27 ¶ 79."
212,9," The parties also contest the difficulty of Evonik and PeroxyChem's swinging between grades of hydrogen peroxide in a manner 
that does not necessarily bear on the market's ability to constrain prices post-merger because it does not impact other suppliers' 
ability to constrain a post-merger Evonik. It is difficult for Evonik to swing into tin-free hydrogen peroxide products and aseptic 
packaging, but PeroxyChem currently and easily swings into each of these end uses, see Montag Hrg. Tr. 1516:20-1517:19, 
1522:9-25, and so will a post-merger Evonik. Similarly, it is difficult for PeroxyChem to swing into pre-electronics grade hydrogen 
peroxide, but Evonik already markets pre-electronics hydrogen peroxide, see JX0001-002. Evidence of PeroxyChem's ability to 
break into that market is therefore only relevant to the extent that it reflects swinging difficulties faced by other suppliers [TEXT 
REDACTED BY THE COURT] PPFFCL at 10-11 ¶¶ 32-33. "
213,10," [F]or [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] percent of Evonik's volume of food grade hydrogen peroxide, Evonik's per unit 
margin is higher than Evonik's average per unit margin on pre-electronics grade; for [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] 
percent of Evonik's volume of cosmetics grade hydrogen peroxide, Evonik's per unit margin is higher than Evonik's average per 
unit margin on pre-electronics grade; for [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] percent of Evonik's volume of hydrogen peroxide 
for teeth whitening, Evonik's per unit margin is higher than Evonik's average per unit margin on pre-electronics grade. 
Furthermore, while food grade, cosmetics grade and hydrogen peroxide for teeth whitening are relatively low volume products 
for Evonik, for every 100 units of pre-electronics grade hydrogen peroxide that Evonik sells, it sells [TEXT REDACTED BY THE 
COURT] units of standard grade hydrogen peroxide at a per unit margin that is higher than its average per unit margin on pre-
electronics grade. Rothman Rebuttal Rpt., PX7102-017; see also Rothman Hrg. Tr. 791:24-792:19. "
214,11," The FTC also argues that its proposed market satisfies the hypothetical monopolist test because consumers would not 
substitute away from non-electronics hydrogen peroxide to other chemicals. See, e.g., PFFCL at 85 ¶ 25. That cannot save the 
FTC's overbroad market. The hypothetical monopolist test ""is designed to ensure that candidate markets are not overly narrow."" 
Merger Guidelines § 4; see also id. § 4.1.1 (test ""does not lead to a single relevant market""). It says nothing about whether a 
market is overly broad."
214,12," The D.C. Circuit's Whole Foods decision lacked a majority opinion. See Whole Foods, 548 F.3d at 1051 n.1, 1061 n.8 
(Kavanaugh, J., dissenting). Thus, in referring to one of the two concurring opinions or the dissent, the Court will indicate the 
name of the Judge whose opinion is cited. See id. at 1032 (Brown, J.); id. at 1041 (Tatel, J.); id. at 1051 (Kavanaugh, J., 
dissenting). "
215,13," The record lacks evidence of market concentration statistics or other quantitative measures of anticompetitive effects for 
alternative specialty grade or pre-electronics grade hydrogen peroxide product markets."
215,14," While the FTC has consistently pleaded and argued for a product market consisting of non-electronics grade hydrogen 
peroxide, Defendants contend that the FTC's swinging theory only arose after it moved for a preliminary injunction: This supply side approach didn't arise until Dr. Rothman's report after the fact discovery was closed. There is no mention in 
the complaint of supply side [**42]  factors informing product market definition, none. There's no mention of the word 
""swing"" or ""shift"" anywhere in the FTC's complaint. They ask no discovery of any of the five suppliers leading up to -- in the 
discovery leading up to the hearing, anything about their ability to shift or swing. Mahr Hrg. Tr. 2321:8-15. "
216,15," The Brown Shoe practical indicia also weigh against a standard grade market. The hydrogen peroxide industry recognizes 
""well-defined submarkets"" by end use; end uses within standard grade, by their definition, have ""peculiar characteristics and 
uses""; their customers tend to be different (save for distributors who re-sell hydrogen peroxide into various industries); and 
prices are distinct. Brown Shoe, 370 U.S. at 325; see, e.g., PPFFCL at 4 ¶ 12; Dumas Hrg. Tr. 235:1-3; PX2047-031 (standard 
grade hydrogen peroxide for mining sells at nearly 15 percent higher price than for pulp and paper bleaching); JX0083-065 to -
118 (Evonik's competitor details database)."
216,16," The record does include some evidence on pricing for standard grade, see, e.g., PX2047-031; Hill Rpt. JX0066-098 fig. 45, 
but the Court is unable to glean from that data the profit margins for each product, which is the relevant metric to assess whether 
suppliers are likely to swing. Cf. Rebel Oil, 51 F.3d at 1436 (""it is immaterial that . . . a price differential exists"" between supply-
substitutable products). "
217,17, [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] PX1201-012 [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] 
218,18," Dr. Rothman did not analyze what impact a divestiture to a new competitor would have on the likelihood of anticompetitive 
coordinated effects in the Pacific Northwest. Even so, there is no basis in the record to conclude that UI would be any more likely 
than PeroxyChem to coordinate with suppliers in the Pacific Northwest to substantially harm consumers."
218,19," Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 201(b)(2) and (c)(2), the Court takes judicial notice of the following adjudicative fact apparent from the 
Consent Agreement signed January 13, 2020, by the Commissioner of Competition and Evonik: The Commissioner of 
Competition of the Canadian Competition Bureau has reached a Consent Agreement with Evonik to approve its merger with 
PeroxyChem and the divestiture of the Prince George plant to United Initiators. See Consent Agreement, ECF No. 141-1 at 1-2, 
10, 12-13, 27; Defendants' Request for Judicial Notice, ECF No. 141. The Commissioner found that UI satisfied these 
requirements: [TEXT REDACTED IN ORIGINAL SOURCE] Consent Agreement, ECF No. 141-1 at 10, 12-13. The Court takes 
judicial notice solely for the purpose of evaluating the likelihood of the divestiture's closing; after Canadian regulatory approval, 
the divestiture is now more likely to do so. "
219,20," [TEXT REDACTED IN ORIGINAL SOURCE] See PPFFCL at 67-68 ¶ 230. Still, even without UI receiving all of Prince 
George's ""management infrastructure"" from PeroxyChem's Philadelphia headquarters, Aetna, 240 F. Supp. 3d at 60; see Lerner 
Hrg. Tr. 1360:11-12, UI is likely to replace PeroxyChem's competitive intensity in the Pacific Northwest. See Montag Hrg. Tr. 
1553:4-7; Kramer Hrg. Tr. 1627:11-17."

220,23," The FTC notes that Evonik can evict UI on short notice from this plant, PPFFCL at 70-71 ¶ 242, implying that Evonik could do 
so to strongarm UI into coordinating on price or declining to compete for certain customers. But there is no evidence in the 
record to suggest that the Evonik-UI lease is not beneficial to both parties, and Evonik has denied all such intentions. See 
Cummins Hrg. Tr. 1742:14-20. "
221,24," UI's good-faith desire to compete in the hydrogen peroxide industry is one of many features that distinguish it from the failed 
divestiture in Aetna, 240 F. Supp. 3d at 72. See id. at 62, 72-73 (proposed divestiture buyer ""repeatedly tried to enter"" the 
market in the past and failed); id. at 63, 65 (buyer would not acquire anything resembling a standalone business); id. at 65 
(buyer showed substantial doubts about its own ability to succeed); id. at 72 (purchase price 1/10th of fair market value)."
221,25, But see ECF No. 142 at 3 n.2 (comparing standards for merger remedies in the United States and Canada). 
222,26," The HHI is calculated by squaring the market share of each firm in the market and adding up these squares (so, if there are 
three firms with market shares of 50%, 30%, and 20%, the HHI would be 50² + 30² + 20² = 3,800). Squaring the individual 
market shares allocates proportionately greater weight to firms with larger shares, reflecting the larger threat to competitive 
behavior they pose. See Merger Guidelines § 5.3. For antitrust purposes, the FTC and the U.S. Department of Justice generally 
classify markets as ""unconcentrated,"" ""moderately concentrated,"" and ""highly concentrated."" An unconcentrated market features 
an HHI of below 1,500. A moderately concentrated market has an HHI of between 1,500 and 2,500, while a highly concentrated 
market has an HHI that is greater than 2,500. Id. "
223,," Economists calculate the HHI score of an industry before and after the proposed merger. Transactions that result in an HHI 
increase of fewer than 100 points ""are unlikely to have adverse competitive effects."" Id. In moderately concentrated markets, a 
transaction that increases the HHI by more than 100 points ""potentially raise[s] significant competitive concerns and often 
warrant[s] scrutiny."" Id. Mergers ""resulting in highly concentrated markets that involve an increase in the HHI of more than 200 
points will be presumed to be likely to enhance market power."" Id. This presumption of anticompetitive effects ""may be rebutted 
by persuasive evidence showing that the merger is unlikely to enhance market power."" Id. FTC v. Tronox Ltd., 332 F. Supp. 3d 187, 207 (D.D.C. 2018) "
224,27," One judge has gone so far as to suggest that a plaintiff ""may"" prove a Section 7 violation even without meeting its prima facie 
burden under Baker Hughes to ""defin[e] a market and show[] undue concentration in that market."" Whole Foods, 548 F.3d at 
1036 (Brown, J.) (citing Baker Hughes, 908 F.2d at 982-83; United States v. El Paso Natural Gas Co., 376 U.S. 651, 660, 84 S. 
Ct. 1044, 12 L. Ed. 2d 12 (1964)). Even if the FTC here could meet its prima facie burden without showing undue concentration 
in a relevant market—instead relying on other evidence of anticompetitive harm such as predicted price effects, e.g., Rothman 
Rpt., JX0075-094 & n.324, -097 to - 099 & nn.334, 339, 344; id. -104 to - 106 & nn.350, 354, 356, 358—that record evidence 
would not make out a prima facie case for the reasons already described. The FTC's threshold failure to define a relevant market 
hamstrings its ability to show (and the Court's ability to evaluate) a likely and substantial lessening of competition."
224,28," The FTC introduced data on predicted first order approximation effects and merger simulation predicted price effects for an 
alternative standard grade hydrogen peroxide product market in the Southern and Central United States and in alternative 
geographic markets in the Southern, Central, and Western United States—none of which the FTC has shown are relevant 
markets. See Rothman Rpt., JX0075-094 & n.324, -097 to - 099 & nn.334, 339, 344; id. -104 to - 106 & nn.350, 354, 356, 358. "
225,29," The Court admitted over 1,300 exhibits en masse at the beginning of the two-week evidentiary hearing. See Hrg. Tr. 155:20-
157:5; Final Exhibit List, ECF No. 135-2; Joint Report on Defendants' Outstanding Objections, ECF No. 139-1. But the Court did 
not accord all that evidence equal weight. When a party cited an exhibit in its proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law 
without laying a foundation for it at the hearing, or where it cited the deposition of a witness who did not testify at the hearing, the 
Court granted less weight to the evidence (and sometimes no weight). See, e.g., PPFFCL at 77 ¶ 263 (citing JX0021). That 
weight depended on several factors. See Minute Order of October 23, 2019 (denying Defendants' request to exclude certain 
categories of evidence because the Federal Rules of Evidence do not apply to preliminary injunction hearings, but noting that 
the Court would accord weight to evidence depending on the manner in which it was presented, whether a foundation for it was 
laid, and whether the circumstances suggested its relevance and reliability). "
226,30," The FTC notes that some pulp and paper customers award business on a mill-by-mill basis, so those large-volume buyers do 
not ""inherently impede coordinated conduct."" PPFFCL at 99 ¶ 80; see id. at 78 ¶ 268. Although this may mitigate the effect of 
large and long-term contracts somewhat, each of those mills are still purchasing high volumes of hydrogen peroxide, and 
competition is progressively stronger for this ""shrinking pie"" of pulp and paper customers. Rhilinger Hrg. Tr. 2414:18; see Hill 
Hrg. Tr. 2205:20-2206:4; JX0089-003 (almost 19 million pounds of hydrogen peroxide volume for [TEXT REDACTED IN 
ORIGINAL SOURCE] pulp and paper mill)."
226,31," For example, the record reflects only one public price announcement since 2016. See PX2055-004; PPFFCL at 44 ¶ 149; 
DPFFCL at 73 ¶ 190. The FTC argues that [TEXT REDACTED IN ORIGINAL SOURCE] attempted to raise prices in 2018, an 
allegation it first leveled after the hearing in its proposed findings of fact, PPFFCL at 44 ¶ 149 (citing [TEXT REDACTED IN 
ORIGINAL SOURCE] JX0054 [TEXT REDACTED IN ORIGINAL SOURCE]; PX3028-001), and without questioning the relevant 
witnesses about it at the evidentiary hearing: [TEXT REDACTED IN ORIGINAL SOURCE] Even so, it appears the attempted 
price increase was only communicated to customers, not to the public. See PX3028-001; Mahr Hrg. Tr. 2421:23-2422:3. In 
addition, when suppliers fixed prices two decades ago, they frequently reached swap agreements with each other. DPFFCL at "
227,73," ¶ 191. A swap agreement occurs ""when there's a customer that's relatively distant from its supplier, and that supplier makes 
a deal with a closer supplier to instead serve the customer on its behalf."" Hill Hrg. Tr. 2066:19-22. A swap agreement lessens 
the incentive to compete for customers in the first place because both parties to the swap benefit from a single customer. Id. 
2065:22-2067:1. And finally, suppliers used to include meet-or-release clauses in their customer contracts. DPFFCL at 73 ¶ 192. 
That clause allows a customer under contract who is offered a better price elsewhere to tell its current supplier, ""[m]atch that 
price or I'm going to make the contract invalid and switch to the other supplier."" Id. 2065:18-22. Meet-or-release clauses also 
lowered suppliers' incentive to compete aggressively in the first place, and they served as ""an early warning system for detecting 
deviations"" from coordination. Id. 2065:23-2066:7. "
229,32," The FTC relies on a benign remark by Nouryon's Paul Radlinski to argue that [TEXT REDACTED IN ORIGINAL SOURCE]

REDACTED IN ORIGINAL SOURCE])."
229,33," Even setting aside the GUPPI's market-share input, the model is unreliable here because: (1) the Merger Guidelines only 
recommend using the GUPPI to predict upward pricing pressure for ""differentiated products,"" § 6.1, and the products here are 
homogenous within each relevant product market (hydrogen peroxide formulated for a specific end use), see Hill Rpt., JX0066-
084 to - 085; (2) the GUPPI ""assumes that customers have little or no bargaining power,"" Rothman Rpt., JX0075-088, which is 
not the case with hydrogen peroxide customers; and (3) accurate GUPPI results ""require[] precise information on pass-through 
behavior,"" and Dr. Rothman provides no evidence to support his .8 pass-through rate of cost to price, see Hill Rpt., JX0066-086 
to - 089. "
231,34," Defendants objected to the admission of these two exhibits, PX3000 and PX3020, emails exchanged by [TEXT REDACTED 
IN ORIGINAL SOURCE] employees. See ECF No. 139-1. The Court overrules the objections and admits them, but gives them 
little weight. Documents such as these appear highly speculative, and because most of their authors did not testify, the Court 
has little basis to assess their reliability. Indeed, the FTC did not even bother to ask [TEXT REDACTED IN ORIGINAL 
SOURCE]—the only author who did testify—about them. See DPFFCL at 62 n.378."
231,35," Defendants argue that efficiencies or ""logistics savings"" from their merger may reduce the price of hydrogen peroxide or offset 
any predicted price increase, DPFFCL at 96-97 ¶ 258, but those purported savings are unverifiable and did not weigh into the 
Court's analysis. See PPFFCL at 76-77 ¶¶ 260-61; Aetna, 240 F. Supp. 3d at 94 (""the estimate of the predicted saving must be 
reasonable verifiable by an independent party""). "

under the United States Constitution.""). "
269,2," Because Excentus and Skupos have amended and extended the terms of the underlying agreement, the Court will not consider 
whether Success Systems's Clayton Act and Sherman Act claims against these defendants are moot. See Notice, ECF No. 91 
(Jan. 24, 2020). "
272,3," Excentus also argues that it lacks monopoly power in defense of Success Systems's Sherman Act § 1 claim. See Excentus 
Mem. to Dismiss Failure to State a Claim at 26-27. This argument will be more fully addressed in the Court's analysis of any 
alleged monopoly power by Excentus with respect to Success System's § 2 claims. "
275,4," The Court further considers whether Success Systems has sufficiently pled an antitrust injury below in the context of Success 
Systems's exclusive dealing claim against Excentus. "
276,5," Significantly, the Court has not identified any caselaw — nor have Success Systems identified any caselaw in its filings 
suggesting the proper standard of review for this allegedly hybrid § 1 and § 2 of the Sherman Act claim. See 15 U.S.C §§ 1-3 
(specifying distinct elements for each individual antitrust claim). Consistent with other exclusive dealing claims, however, the 
Court will analyze this claim using caselaw applying § 1 of the Sherman Act. See Texaco Inc. v. Dagher, 547 U.S. 1, 5, 126 S. 
Ct. 1276, 164 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2006); (analyzing a challenged restraint of trade, which was not per se illegal, under the rule of 
reason). At best, one treatise suggests ""exclusive dealing is subject to challenge under Section 1 of the Sherman Act . . . and as 
conduct evidencing a violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act."" ABA Section of Antitrust Law, ANTITRUST LAW 
DEVELOPMENTS, 215 (Debra J. Peralstein et al. eds., 5th ed. 2002). "
283,1, Defendant notes that Joshi left HP in 2012. ECF No. 10-1 at 9.
283,2," Plaintiff also alleges that Meg Whitman served as a top executive at HP during the time of the ""no-poach agreement,"" and 
notes that Whitman was involved in a 2014 settlement with the Department of Justice regarding eBay Inc.'s separate no-poach 
agreement with Intuit Inc. SAC ¶ 53. "
287,3," The Court additionally notes that Plaintiff's allegations appear contradictory; if HP and 3D Systems did agree to refrain from 
poaching each other's employees, not only would 3D Systems have been unlikely to interview an HP employee, there would 
have also been no need for HP to fire employees who were hired by 3D Systems, or to warn HP's employees against seeking 
employment with 3D Systems. "
289,4," Plaintiff cites the 2016 guidance from the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission, which states that no-poach 
agreements are per se illegal. See DOJ/FTC Antitrust Guidance for HR Professionals, October 2016. However, although this 
guidance cites a number of DOJ and FTC prosecutions that ended in consent judgments, it does not cite any judicial opinions on 
the question of whether no-poach agreements are always per se illegal. "
290,5," Since the Court has already held that the insufficiency of Plaintiff's allegations regarding Defendant's violation of the Sherman 
and Cartwright Acts merits granting of Defendant's motion to dismiss, the Court declines to address the issue of Article III 
standing."
290,6," Defendant also argues that (1) Plaintiff's claim fails since Section 16600 does not confer a statutory cause of action, and (2) 
Plaintiff lacks standing to seek declaratory and injunctive relief. Since Plaintiff's claim has been denied for the reasons described 
above, the Court declines to address these issues here. "
294,1," Plaintiff stated at the Final Pretrial Conference that it has dismissed certain defendants from certain of its claims. These 
changes are reflected in Plaintiff's proposed verdict form and proposed jury instructions. See ECF 407 (Plaintiff's verdict form). 
Relevant here, Plaintiff brings its claim for actual monopolization under Section 2 of the Sherman Act against VHT StarStar (and 
its wholly-owned subsidiary, Zoove) only. Id. at 6."
294,2," Plaintiff originally alleged a ""group boycott"" in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. See TAC ¶¶ 274-75. However, Plaintiff 
is apparently no longer pursuing a group boycott theory, which is a theory of per se illegality, see TAC ¶ 274, NYNEX Corp. v. 
Discon, Inc., 525 U.S. 128, 135, 119 S. Ct. 493, 142 L. Ed. 2d 510 (1998). Instead, Plaintiff is only pursuing its Section 1 claim 
under the Rule of Reason. ECF 409 at 19 (Plaintiff's proposed jury instruction for Section 1). "

324,1," Maui Jim does not move for summary judgment on its claims for trademark dilution and tortious interference with its third-party 
contracts. (Pl.'s Mem. Lanham MSJ (Dkt. No. 427) at 39.) "
325,2," For example, when Maui Jim asked Defendants' 30(b)(6) witness whether Defendants took any of the 93 Photographs of Maui 
Jim sunglasses they displayed on its website, he testified ""Not that I can recall."" (Id. ¶ 18) (internal citation omitted).) "
326,3," Maui Jim's Exhibit 9 to its Memorandum in Support of its Copyright Summary Judgment Motion is a chart allegedly showing 
excerpts from Defendants' website that displays what appears to be Maui Jim's 93 Photographs. (Pl.'s Mem. Copyright MSJ Ex. 
9 (Dkt. 425-1).) This chart includes five columns: Style Name, Title of Work, Date of Registration and Registration Number, Maui 
Jim Copyrighted Image, and Image Reproduced on SmartBuyWebsite. (Id.) "
328,4," Defendants filed a motion to exclude the Sowers Survey. (Dkt No. 417.) We previously denied that motion. (Dkt. No. 494.) We 
incorporate the analysis and reasoning contained within our Memorandum Opinion and Order denying the Sowers Survey within 
this summary judgment Memorandum Opinion and Order. (Id.) "
330,5," Defendant's explanation for this factual dispute is, in part, that Maui Jim miscounted companies, like [TEXT REDACTED BY 
THE COURT], that have slightly different names on the list than they do within Maui Jim's system. "
332,6," We reject Defendants' laches defense for various reasons. For laches to apply, the defendant must show: (1) the plaintiff had 
knowledge of the defendant's use of an allegedly infringing mark; (2) the plaintiff inexcusably delayed taking action with respect 
to the defendant's use; and (3) the defendant would be prejudiced by allowing the plaintiff to assert its rights. See Chattanoga 
Mfg., Inc. v. Nike, Inc., 301 F.3d 789, 792-93 (7th Cir. 2002). Defendants' laches defense is based on the premise that Maui Jim 
knew at least eight years before filing this lawsuit that Defendants were selling Maui-Jim-branded sunglasses absent an 
authorized retailer agreement. We hold that Defendants have not shown that Maui Jim inexcusably delayed taking action, nor 
that they would be prejudiced by allowing this lawsuit to go forward, nor that Maui Jim acquiesced to their conduct for the 
following reasons. For one, Maui Jim sent a cease and desist letter concerning the core of this case's issue, and Defendants' 
Co-Founder David Menning's response to that letter indicated a mutual understanding that his company would stop their 
conduct. (Pl.'s Resp. to Defs.' Amend. SOF (Dkt. No. 466) ¶ 23; Defs.' SOF Ex. 43 (Dkt. No. 415-59) at 2-3.) Maui Jim echoed its 
cease and desist letter again in 2009. (See, e.g., Pl.'s Resp. to Defs.' Amend. SOF (Dkt. No. 466) ¶ 76, 100 (citing Ex. 112 of 
Defs.' Amend. SOF).) More, Maui Jim's CFO, Paul Lippens, testified that Maui Jim waited to sue Defendants until their conduct 
had a significant impact on plaintiff's goodwill and business reputation. (Pl.'s Resp. to Defs.' Amend. SOF (Dkt. No. 466) ¶ 77 
(testifying to a culmination of Maui Jim's awareness along with an increased number of related incidences and customer 
complaints).) See Am. Eagle Outfitters, Inc. v. Am. Eagle Furniture, Inc., No. 11-cv-02242, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 180912, 2013 
WL 6839815, at *11 (N.D. Ill. Dec. 27, 2013) (""a trademark owner is not forced by the rule of laches to sue until the likelihood of 
confusion caused by the accused use presents a significant danger to the mark.""). Indeed, the record shows that Maui Jim's 
lawsuit was filed soon after Defendants' sales and marketing of Maui-Jim-branded sunglasses rapidly increased. (See Pl.'s 
Resp. to Defs.' Amend. SOF (Dkt. No. 466) ¶¶ 77-79 (illustrating Defendants' increase in sales and marketing of Maui-Jim-
branded sunglasses leading up to this lawsuit's filing).) Nor have Defendants been demonstrably prejudiced by any delay since 
their alleged infringing conduct continues post-filing of this lawsuit, suggesting that they would have continued their conduct were 
the lawsuit filed sooner. Last, to the extent that Defendants contend that Maui Jim acquiesced to their conduct through acts "
333,," committed by certain Maui Jim Italy employees, the record is bereft of any facts suggesting that they had Maui Jim's graces to 
do so, and any suggestion of acquiescence is directly refuted by Maui Jim's cease and desist letters. (Id. ¶¶ 80-81.) "
334,7," Defendants asserted the first sale doctrine as an affirmative defense in their Answer. (Answer (Dkt. No. 259) at 31-32.) 
Curiously, Defendants' legal position flipped to the opposite in their supplemental briefing on this issue. (Defs.' Supp. Mem. (Dkt. 
No. 499) at 2-3.)"
334,8," The Supreme Court last scrutinized the first sale doctrine in 2013 without discussing burdens. See Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & 
Sons, Inc., 568 U.S. 519, 528, 133 S. Ct. 1351, 1357, 185 L. Ed. 2d 392 (2013). In Kirtsaeng, the Supreme Court held that the 
first sale doctrine applies to copies of works made and sold abroad. Id. Central to that decision was the fact that the first sale 
doctrine has its roots in common law principles that made no geographical distinction. Id."
334,9," Adobe further explained: What does this mean in practical terms? In the context of a summary judgment motion in a software case, it simply means 
that the party asserting a first sale defense must come forward with evidence sufficient for a jury to find lawful acquisition of 
title, through purchase or otherwise, to genuine copies of the copyrighted software. To the extent that the copyright holder 
claims that the alleged infringer could not acquire title or ownership because the software was never sold, only licensed, the 
burden shifts back to the copyright holder to establish such a license or the absence of a sale. Id. "
335,10," Defendants state that it is actually [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] total suppliers rather than [TEXT REDACTED BY 
THE COURT] and that the [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] tally was the result of an administrative error. (Dkt. No. 458 at 
7.) "
336,11," Our conclusion would be the same had the burden been Maui Jim's to bear. Had the burden been Maui Jim's, we would have 
held that they did enough to convince us that a question of material fact existed as to whether an authorized first sale occurred 
such that judgment as a matter of law would be rendered inappropriate. "
339,12," We additionally think that a jury could find that the difference in warranty provider alone could warrant a material difference 
even if the warranties' terms were identical. For example, we conjecture that a warranty from an institutional manufacturer would 
certainly be perceived more valuable to a consumer than the same warranty term provided by a discount retailer. We think that 
that could make sense under the appropriate circumstances, but the parties do not address whether consumers would be more 
likely to trust an institutional manufacturer's warranty fulfillment promise more than a lesser known discount vendor's."
339,13," Campen testified that Maui Jim's repair department received on average three to four nonprescription lenses per week for 
repair services between 2015 and 2018. (Pl.'s Resp. to Defs.' SOF (Dkt. 466) ¶ 70(f).) The jury is best positioned to determine 
how that frequency of repair requests reflects on the materiality of the repair service. "
341,14," Defendants dispute that any of the examples references within Maui Jim's Ex. 32 to its Statement of Facts reflects actual 
customer confusion from SmartBuyGlasses' statements and actions. (Defs.' Resp. to Pl.'s SOF ¶ 65 (Dkt. No. 459 at 23.) "
342,15," In relevant part, one executive said: ""Maui Jim will generate top sales for us if we can secure it,"" ""Maui [J]im is a very solid 
online brand and will mean significant sales if we can secure it,"" and ""when we were online with it even for a week, we were 
starting to get great sales."" (Defs.' Resp. to Pl.'s SOF ¶ 57.) "
344,16," Defendants additionally argue that the underlying incidents of ""actual confusion"" organized into the ""Confusion Chart"" are 
inadmissible hearsay. We overrule Defendants' hearsay objection under the business record exception to the rule against 
hearsay. Fed. R. Evid. 803(6)(B). These documents are records of a regularly conducted activity that were made at or near the 
time they transpired, were kept in the course of a regularly conducted activity of a business, and making these records was a 
regular practice. So, these actual statements between customers and customer service representatives are admissible just like 
emails are commonly admissible and excepted from the rule against hearsay. Based on the record before us, we hold that the 
communications between customer service representatives and customers fall into this Business Record exception to the rule 
against hearsay. "
345,17," We note the parties' disagreement as to the applicable trademark dilution law. The applicable law for the trademark dilution 
claim is the Federal Trademark Dilution Act of 1995, as amended by the Trademark Dilution Revision Act of 2006, 15 U.S.C. § 
1125(c). This requires a showing that the mark is famous, that the defendant adopted an identical or similar mark, that 
defendant's use likely dilutes the plaintiff's mark by blurring or tarnishment, and commercial use of the mark. See, e.g., Joshi v. 
Joshi, No. 18 C 5426, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 128625, 2019 WL 3554388, at *5 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 1, 2019) (internal citation omitted). "
347,18," This diagram suggests that Defendants' supply chain is direct from the manufacturer to the costumer rather than the 
""traditional supply chain"" that routes from the manufacturer to an exporter to an importer to a wholesaler to a shop and then to a 
customer. (Id.). That diagram also contained the following accompanying sentence: ""By offering the world's largest range of 
authentic designer eyewear, sourced directly from the world's leading eywear [sic] suppliers, we are here to help you find what 
you love."" (Id.) Dispute as to whether this diagram was factually misleading as to the Maui Jim brand exists at least in part 
because Defendants claim that it ""was accurate and consistent with SmartBuyGlasses' practice for the majority of its sales 
including manufacturers/brands — such as [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] and [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] - 
from which it buys genuine products from the manufacturer of the brands and ships it to its consumers"" and that they made 
consumers aware of this reality through disclaimers. (Id. ¶ 68)"
347,19," Although Defendants do not dispute that they do not have any physical location or physical office in New York (id. ¶ 41) they 
contend that they do have an ""operational dropship location in New York."" (Id. ¶ 40 (citing Defs.' SOAF ¶ 15).) Therefore, a 
question of material fact remains as to whether this statement is truthful. We were not presented with the factual differences 
between an 'operational dropship location,' an 'operation centre,' and a physical location. Nor have the parties articulated the 
difference to us at this summary judgment stage. Thus, the specific factual inquiry left for the jury is whether Defendants' 
'operational dropship location' identified as an ""operation centre"" on the U.S. Location Image was a false statement, given the 
fact that Defendants do not have a physical location in New York. "
348,20," Defendants' dispute the results of that survey and asked us to exclude it. (Def.'s Resp. to Pl.'s SOF ¶ 70 (Dkt. No. 459 ¶ 70); 
Def.'s Mot. to Excl. Surv. and Test. of B. Sowers (Dkt. No. 417).) We denied that motion. (Dkt. No. 496)"
348,21," We are also not convinced at this juncture that the Sowers Survey is enough to resolve questions of material fact regarding 
falsity because it does not specifically evaluate the effects of Defendants' disclaimers."
348,22," We find that the advertising issue as to third—party lenses also depends on the resolution of a question of material fact. The 
parties dispute whether Defendants' statements pertaining to third-party prescription lenses (less than 1% of Defendants' sales) 
were false. (See Defs.' Resp. to Pl.'s SOF ¶¶ 54-59.) On one hand, Maui Jim contends that Defendants advertised that their 
prescription lenses were manufactured by Maui Jim. On the other hand, Defendants contend that SmartBuyGlasses.com did not 
so advertise because they referred to those prescription lenses on their website with words like ""our"" rather than ""Maui Jim's 
prescription lenses."" (See id.) We are unable to say that no question of material fact exists as to whether that statement would 
be perceived as misleading as to who ""our"" pertained to (whether Defendants or Maui Jim) so we defer that question to the jury 
as well. "
349,23," We note that the Ninth Circuit held in 1981 that reverse passing of occurs ""when the wrongdoer removes the name or 
trademark on another party's product and sells that product under a name chosen by the wrongdoer,"" rather than requiring the 
passed—off—name be the wrongdoer's own. Smith v. Montoro, 648 F.2d 602, 605 (9th Cir. 1981) (emphasis added). We follow 
the precise words used by the Supreme Court and the controlling Seventh Circuit and hold that Defendants must have 
substituted its own name for the true manufacturer to be liable for reverse passing off. See Dastar Corp., 539 U.S. at 27 n.1, 123 
S. Ct. at 2045 n.1; see also Bretford Mfg., 419 F.3d at 580. This approach harmonizes with Supreme Court's explanatory dicta 
that illustrated reverse passing off as to prohibit the Coca—Cola Company from filling Coca—Cola branded bottles with Pepsi—
Cola, and then selling it as Coca—Cola. Dastar Corp., 539 U.S. at 32, 123 S. Ct. at 2047."
349,24," According to Maui Jim, [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] is one of Maui Jim's biggest competitors and one of Defendants' 
main partners. (Pl.'s Mem. Lanham MSJ (Dkt. No. 427) at 38.)"
349,25," Nothing on the record suggests that Defendants benefited from listing [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] over Maui Jim as 
the manufacturer through the means of kick-backs paid by [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] increased customer demand, 
or otherwise."
349,26," We note that this situation could be different had the mislabeling of the manufacturer's identity occurred on advertisements 
rather than post-purchase commercial invoices."
349,27," Although Defendants' motion for summary judgment in their favor on the Lanham Act claims requests judgment ""on all of Maui 
Jim's Lanham Act Claims,"" neither the motion nor memorandum specifically requested summary judgment in their favor on Maui 
Jim's reverse passing off claims. (See generally Defs.' Mot. MSJ (Dkt. No. 412); Defs.' Mem. MSJ (Dkt. No. 416.)) We decline to 
sua sponte raise that argument. "
352,28," Defendants may revisit their argument concerning the 22 Photographs at trial. See 17 U.S.C. § 412 (""Registration as 
prerequisite to certain remedies for infringement."") "
353,29," Nevertheless, even if 'access' was a disputed fact, we would infer the existence of access because of the striking similarity of 
the works at issue. Weller, 312 F. Supp. 3d at 718 (quoting Design Basics, 858 F.3d at 1100 (""inference of access may also 
arise from 'proof of similarity which is so striking that the possibilities of independent creation, coincidence and prior common 
source are, as a practical matter, precluded.'"")). "
354,30," This necessarily defers the legal question of whether those third-party contracts are valid and enforceable. Insofar as 
Defendants contend that those contracts are unenforceable under European law: the European Court of Justice (""ECJ"") 
squarely addressed the legality of authorized retailer contracts and distribution networks under TFEU Article 101 in the context 
of luxury or high-end goods and ruled such contracts are not prohibited when three conditions are met: (1) the product 
necessitates a selective distribution system because it is high quality or technical; (2) resellers must be chosen on the basis of 
objective criteria; (3) the criteria defined must not go beyond what is necessary. Case C-230/16, Coty Germany GmbH v 
Parfumerie Akzente GmbH, 2017 EUR-Lex CELEX LEXIS 62016CJ0230, at ￿ 24. In the words of the ECJ: ""[T]he characteristics 
and conditions of a selective distribution system may, in themselves, preserve the quality and ensure the proper use of such 
goods."" Id., at ￿ 26. Indeed, the ECJ held that contract terms prohibiting authorized retailers from selling luxury goods through 
third-party online retailers were not illegal contract terms. Id. at ￿￿ 40, 52. "
356,31," Maui Jim contends that summary judgment in its favor is additionally appropriate under the unclean hands doctrine because 
Counterclaimants made false statements to both U.S. Customs and consumers about the manufacturer and/or source of their 
Maui Jim-branded sunglasses by representing that [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] made them. See, e.g., Intercon Sols., 
Inc. v. Basel Action Network, 969 F. Supp. 2d 1026, 1064 (N.D. Ill. 2013), aff'd on other grounds, 791 F.3d 729 (7th Cir. 2015) 
(discussing the doctrine of unclean hands). Maui Jim contends that these false documents prompted them to make some of the 
statements at issue in this lawsuit. ""The bad conduct constituting unclean hands must involve fraud, unconscionability or bad 
faith toward the party proceeded against, and must pertain to the subject matter involved and affect the equitable relations 
between the litigants."" Int'l Union, Allied Indus. Workers of Am., v. Local Union No. 589, Allied Indus. Workers of Am., 693 F.2d 
666, 672 (7th Cir. 1982) (internal quotations and citations omitted). We find that this is a factual question for the jury that is 
inappropriate at this juncture because it turns on, among other things, the factually disputed material question as to whether 
Counterclaimants' inaccurate statements as to [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] involvement was bad-faith misconduct or a 
good-faith computer coding error. (Pl.'s Resp. to Defs.' SOF (Dkt. 466) ¶ 51). "
357,32," Because the unfair competition law counterclaim is coterminous with the Cartwright Act counterclaim, dismissal of the latter 
leads to dismissal of the former. (Order at 25-26.) "
358,33," We need not address the litigation and fair report privileges arguments because we already found that the statements are not 
actionable as defamation per se. "
360,34," SmartBuyGlasses also assert that the harm they suffer due to Maui Jim's termination of its agreements with retailers who 
violated the pricing policy is the kind of harm the Cartwright Act was designed to prevent. (Dkt. No. 379-1 at 22.) Fundamentally, 
SmartBuyGlasses contend that the injury meets the fourth requirement of an actionable injury. We need not address this 
requirement to dismiss the counterclaim because the injury has not met the two requirements explained above. "
361,35," As this case moves forward, in order to promote organization and clarity for the remainder of this case's litigation, every 
citation to the record made in a filing should include an ECF pincite. "
363,1," Dr. Belnap alleges that the hearing was not fair because Salt Lake Regional employed a panel advisor, William J. Yocum 
(""Yocum""), who had a conflict of interest and was regarded as a ""hospital lawyer."" Dr. Belnap claims that Yocum's strong bias in 
favor of Salt Lake Regional manifested itself throughout the hearing. "
364,2," This is the third in a series of lawsuits Dr. Belnap has filed against JVMC, Salt Lake Regional, the hospitals' owners, and 
various physicians who have practiced at the hospitals, all arising out of Dr. Belnap's lack of privileges to practice at these 
facilities. "
366,3," The court also notes that the district court decided Ardent Health before the Supreme Court set forth the plausibility pleading 
standard in Twombly and Iqbal. Thus, not only are the facts of that case distinguishable from this case, but the court was 
operating under a lower standard of pleading. "
368,4," Steward owns 90% or more of JVMC. Def. Jordan Valley Med. Ctr., LP's Corp. Discl. Statement, ECF No. 13 (Aug. 30, 2019) 
(""No other publicly-held corporation owns 10% or more of Jordan Valley Medical Center, LP's stock."")."
368,5," The court is further persuaded that Dr. Belnap has failed to allege a conspiracy with respect to the JVMC Committee and the 
Appellate Review Body because, during the privileges and credentialing process, those bodies are essentially acting vicariously 
for JVMC. Oksanen v. Page Mem'l Hosp., 945 F.2d 696, 703 (4th Cir. 1991) (""We think . . . that the staff is acting as an agent of 
[the hospital] during the peer review process and as such is indistinct from the hospital.""). Thus, allegations that the JVMC 
Committee and the Appellate Review Body conspired with Defendants cannot meet the requirement that there be a concerted 
action by independent entities. "
369,6," Dr. Belnap makes much out of the roles that Dr. Howard and Dr. Mintz played in him losing his privileges at Salt Lake Regional. 
Whatever roles Dr. Howard and Dr. Mintz played in Salt Lake Regional's credentialing process, however, has no bearing on 
JVMC's credentialing process."
369,7," Dr. Belnap also alleges that Defendants conspired with ""John Does 1-20."" The allegations in the Amended Complaint, 
however, are too insufficient and vague as to those unnamed defendants to allow Dr. Belnap's antitrust claim to proceed. "
376,1, A forward-flow agreement allows the buyer to purchase all of the bank's DDA portfolios for a given period at specified prices. 
380,2," The Ninth Circuit's opinion in Sterling Nelson was overruled on other grounds by Rotec Indus. v. Mitsubishi Corp., 348 F.3d 
1116, 1122 (9th Cir. 2003). "
381,3, Minn. Stat. § 609.86 makes commercial bribery illegal under state law.
381,4," Again, it is worth noting that TMT has not even alleged the existence of a per se refusal-to-deal antitrust violation. HN17[
] As 
discussed above, the Ninth Circuit held that an allegation of commercial bribery does not state a claim under the Sherman Act. 
Calnetics, 532 F.2d at 687. The United States District Court for the southern district of New York came to a similar conclusion in 
World Wrestling Entm't, 425 F. Supp. 2d at 522. "
382,5," During oral argument, counsel stated that there were four or five bidders for the June 2011 DDA portfolio."
382,6," We note that the federal district courts possess exclusive jurisdiction over claims arising under section 4 of the Clayton Act. 
General Talking Pictures Corp. v. De Marce, 203 Minn. 28, 279 N.W. 750, 753 (Minn. 1938) (""[T]he above-quoted provision of 
the Clayton Act, supplementing a similar one in the Sherman Act (section 7, 15 U.S.C.A. §15 note), has been widely construed 
by both state and federal courts to vest exclusive jurisdiction of issues arising under the anti-trust laws in the federal courts 
alone."" (citing Blumenstock Bros. Advert. Agency v. Curtis Publ'g Co., 252 U.S. 436, 40 S. Ct. 385, 64 L. Ed. 649 (1920))). "
390,1," The legal obligations of drug manufacturers at issue in this case are set out by the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, or the Drug 
Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, Pub. L. No. 98-417, 98 Stat. 1585 (codified as amended at 21 
U.S.C. § 355 and 35 U.S.C. § 271(e)), which amended the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (""FDCA""), Pub. L. No. 75-717, 
52 Stat. 1040 (1938) (codified as amended at 21 U.S.C. §§ 301-397)."
390,2," HN3[
] The FDA does have a limited mechanism for reviewing the ""accuracy or relevance of patent information submitted"" for listing in the Orange Book. 21 C.F.R. § 314.53(f). Specifically, anyone may notify the Agency in writing about a potential 
problem. Id. § 314.53(f)(1). In the case of patents claiming the drug substance or drug product, the NDA holder may then be 
required either to ""confirm the correctness of the patent information,"" or ""withdraw or amend the patent information."" Id. § 
314.53(f)(1)(i)(A). There is no indication that any party attempted to use this process in this case. And in any case, as noted in In 
re Buspirone Patent Litigation, this process would not provide convincing evidence that ""the FDA engaged in substantive review 
of the information."" 185 F. Supp. 2d 363, 371-72 (S.D.N.Y. 2002). HN4[
] In fact, the regulation is clear that ""[u]nless the NDA 
holder withdraws or amends its patent information in response to the patent listing dispute, the Agency will not change the patent 
information in the Orange Book."" 21 C.F.R. § 314.53(f)(1)(i)(A). "
392,3," The district court also determined that the plaintiffs' allegations that Sanofi's lawsuits against Lilly, Merck, and Mylan did not 
constitute impermissible serial petitioning. The plaintiffs have abandoned those arguments on appeal, so we need not address 
them. "
394,4," Sanofi does not make the same argument with regard to the statute, which itself employs the term ""any patent."" 21 U.S.C. § 
355(b)(1)."
394,5," And if this is the case, then it is waived for lack of development. See United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990) 
(HN14[
] ""[I]ssues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are 
deemed waived.""). "
396,6," Sanofi does seem to argue that the ""rule of reason"" doctrine applies, but HN18[
] that doctrine developed in the context of section 1 claims and is not typically applied to claims under section 2. See Fraser v. Major League Soccer, L.L.C., 284 F.3d 47, 
55-61 (1st Cir. 2002) (characterizing the rule as ""section 1's rule of reason"" and discussing whether it could be applied to 
evaluate claims of conspiracy between distinct members of the same franchise); MCI Commc'ns Corp. v. Am. Tel. & Tel. Co., 
708 F.2d 1081, 1139 (7th Cir. 1983) (""The Rule of Reason is a rule of construction which applies to section 1 of the Sherman 
Act. The need for such a rule arose because a literal reading of section 1 would prohibit virtually every private contract. . . . [T]he 
Rule of Reason does not directly apply as such to the offense of monopolization under section 2 of the Sherman Act."" (internal 
citations omitted))."
396,7," The parties appear to have settled the case after summary judgment briefing. See Stipulation of Dismissal, Dkt. 65, Mut. 
Pharm. Co. v. Hoechst Marion Roussel, Inc., No. CIV. A. 96-1409, (E.D. Pa. July 1, 1999). "
397,8," As a counter-example, see our recent opinion in Breiding, 939 F.3d at 54-57, in which we applied the filed-rate doctrine to 
claims challenging conduct that was expressly allowed in a FERC tariff. See also, e.g., In re Celexa & Lexapro Mktg. & Sales 
Practices Litig., 915 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2019); Gustavsen v. Alcon Labs., Inc., 903 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2018); In re Celexa & Lexapro 
Mktg. & Sales Practices Litig., 779 F.3d 34 (1st Cir. 2015)."
397,9," One recent district court decision directly addressed the question of whether antitrust plaintiffs were required to plead facts 
alleging an absence of good faith in their prima facie case in order to avoid dismissal on the basis of this exception to antitrust 
liability. See In re Actos End-Payor Antitrust Litig., No. 13-CV-9244, 417 F. Supp. 3d 352, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 170178, 2019 
WL 4805843, at *14-15 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 30, 2019). At least in part because the defendant had acknowledged at oral argument "
398,," that the exception was an affirmative defense to liability, the court determined that the complaint was not required to include 
allegations of bad faith in order to survive a motion to dismiss. Id."
398,10," See United Mine Workers of Am. v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 85 S. Ct. 1585, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626 (1965); E. R.R. Presidents 
Conf. v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 81 S. Ct. 523, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464 (1961). The parties agree that the Noerr-
Pennington doctrine does not apply to this issue. "
409,1," In Supreme Auto, the Seventh Circuit eschewed the term ""antitrust standing,"" noting that it is actually a proximate cause 
requirement. Supreme Auto Transp., LLC, 902 F.3d at 743. "
412,1," The following factual narrative is drawn from the Amended Complaint and disregards any differences between the Amended 
Complaint and the Original Complaint. See W. Run Student Hous. Assocs., LLC v. Huntington Nat'l Bank, 712 F.3d 165, 173 (3d 
Cir. 2013) (noting that because ""the district court typically may not look outside the four corners of the amended complaint, the 
plaintiff cannot be bound by allegations in the superseded complaint""). The Court takes the allegations in the Amended 
Complaint as true and draws all reasonable inferences in favor of Plaintiff, as is required at the motion to dismiss stage. Phillips 
v. Cty. of Allegheny, 515 F.3d 224, 231 (3d Cir. 2008). "
413,2," The Amended Complaint contains various allegations related to concerns raised by the KOLs about alleged nepotism at Recro. 
(Am. Compl. ¶¶ 32-42.) The Court will not address the nepotism allegations because, as acknowledged by Plaintiff, Recro fully 
""disclose[d] the family relationships"" that Plaintiff alleges were suspect. (ECF 41, Plaintiff's Supplemental Submission at 5.) "
414,3," The Amended Complaint does not explain ""the two issues raised by the FDA."" This is presumably a reference to the two 
concerns raised by the KOLs regarding (a) potential inadequacy in manufacturing oversight and (b) the fact that IV Meloxicam 
was marketed as a drug to solve pain following soft-tissue procedures when the KOLs were not impressed by the clinical data on 
efficacy in the soft-tissue context. There is a difference between, on the one hand, Recro being aware that the KOLs raised 
these concerns prior to the FDA's rejection of the NDA and, on the other, Recro being aware that the FDA raised these concerns 
in its decision to deny approval. This gap in logic is addressed briefly in subsection V.E.2's analysis of loss causation. "
415,4," The caption of the action was amended to add two individual defendants, Stewart McCallum and John Harlow. (ECF 27, ECF 
28.) "
416,5," The PSLRA was enacted ""to curb perceived abuses of the § 10(b) private action—'nuisance filings, targeting of deep-pocket 
defendants, vexatious discovery requests and manipulation by class action lawyers.'"" Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, 
Ltd., 551 U.S. 308, 320, 127 S. Ct. 2499, 168 L. Ed. 2d 179 (quoting Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc. v. Dabit, 547 
U.S. 71, 81, 126 S. Ct. 1503, 164 L. Ed. 2d 179 (2006)). The ""substantive and procedural controls"" imposed by the PSLRA 
include procedures for the appointment of lead plaintiffs and lead counsel; limitations on damages and attorney's fees; a safe 
harbor for forward-looking statements; sanctions for frivolous litigation; authorization for a stay of discovery pending decision on 
a motion to dismiss; and additional pleading requirements. Tellabs, 551 U.S. at 320. "
417,6," Although Plaintiff takes issue with two broad omissions (omissions related to the degree of oversight of foreign manufacturing 
and omissions related to the KOLs' concerns about the efficacy of IV Meloxicam in soft tissue procedures), the vast majority of 
the twenty-five misrepresentative statements deal with the latter category of omission. "
423,7," The Court notes that there is an unsupported inferential leap in this theory of loss causation. As Plaintiff acknowledges, the 
stock drop occurred as a result of the FDA's denial of the NDA—not as a result of Recro's failure to publicly disclose the opinions 
of the KOLs. See Am. Compl. ¶ 55 (""Recro's share price was decimated as a result [of] the news [that the FDA decided to deny 
Recro's NDA for IV Meloxicam].""). Said differently, to make the loss causation theory that is briefed work, Plaintiff would need to 
connect Recro's allegedly misleading omissions to the stock drop. However, analyzing this theory in depth is unnecessary 
because, as discussed, Plaintiff alleges that the market price incorporated the omissions at the time of purchase. "
425,8," The Amended Complaint states that CW1 brought forth his concerns ""at meetings to the Company's leadership."" (Am. Compl. ¶ 
42.) The Amended Complaint never explicitly states that these meetings were the same Leadership Team meetings described in 
paragraph 40 of the Amended Complaint. However, based on Plaintiff's representation in the opposition memorandum that CW1 
""conveyed [his knowledge of the KOLs' concerns] to Defendants and other top executives at Leadership Team meetings,"" the 
Court assumes that the ambiguous ""meetings"" Plaintiff refers to were the Leadership Team meetings described elsewhere in the 
Amended Complaint. (Plaintiff's Opposition at 24 25.) "
426,9," The lack of information regarding the meetings at which CW1 communicated with the KOLs is important because the 
statements were made over a roughly one year period starting in July 2017 and ending in May 2018. Depending on when CW1 
communicated the KOLs' concerns, the confidential source information may not bear on scienter at all for statements that were 
made prior to CW1's disclosures."
426,10," Paragraphs 61 to 64 of the Amended Complaint lay out, in detail, the concerns that the KOLs brought to CW1 regarding 
foreign manufacturing. For example, Plaintiff alleges ""CW1 stated that approximately 30% of KOLs expressed their concern to 
CW1 about IV [M]eloxicam being manufactured overseas"" that was based, partially, on ""their experience with foreign 
manufacturing of drugs."" (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 61, 62.) The KOLs also conveyed to CW1 concerns regarding ""Recro's level and 
quality of oversight of the manufacturing process."" (Am. Compl. ¶ 63.) The Amended Complaint then alleges that ""CW1 and 
CW1's Medical Affairs Team reported the KOLs' concerns regarding Sharr and foreign manufacturing of IV [M]eloxicam to 
Recro's top leadership,"" (Am. Compl. ¶ 67.) This level of detail is likely sufficient to establish the ""what"" for purposes of scienter. 
However, as discussed, the allegations regarding the concerns communicated to Recro about IV Meloxicam's efficacy in soft 
tissue procedures were far sparser, and because efficacy is the primary theory of omission, scienter is not adequately pleaded. "
428,11," The allegations related to individual scienter are insufficient, and even assuming that the Third Circuit accepted the doctrine of 
corporate scienter, Plaintiff has not alleged facts that fit within the scope of that doctrine. Therefore, the Court will not analyze 
the scienter of Recro, a corporation. "
433,1, R. Doc. 1-2.
433,2, R. Doc. 12.
433,3," Throughout the pleadings, Plaintiff refers to himself as: ""the CHRISTIAN EMPEROR D'ORLEANS,"" ""his Majesty,"" and ""the 
Trust Protector of the American-l'iberian Indian Tribe of Moses."" See, e.g., R. Doc. 1-2, pp. 1, 4, 46, 56-57."
433,4, 766 F.2d 179 (5th Cir. 1985). 
434,5," A motion for leave to amend is not among the motions expressly excluded from direct ruling by a magistrate judge under 28 
U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(A). Further, although the Fifth Circuit has not ruled on the issue, the weight of authority appears to be that 
motions for leave to amend are generally considered nondispositive in nature. See, e.g., Bona Fide Demolition and Recovery, 
LLC v. Crosby Construction Co. of La., Inc., 07-3115, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 111782, 2010 WL 4176858, *1 (E.D. La. Oct. 20, 
2010)(collecting cases). Accordingly, the undersigned issues a Ruling on the Motion for Leave."
434,6, R. Doc. 1.
434,7," Although the Complaint purports to be verified by an affidavit wherein a ""Notary Public"" avers that Plaintiff personally appeared 
before the Notary, and after being duly sworn, stated: ""That he is petitioner in the above and foregoing petition and that all of the 
allegations of fact contained therein are verified, true, and correct to the best of his information, knowledge and belief,"" the 
affidavit appears invalid because the Notary's signature is illegible, there is no notary stamp or seal, no notary number, and no 
identification of the state and parish/county under which the Notary is commissioned. See R. Doc. 1-2, p. 1. To the extent the 
affidavit does not attest that it is based on Plaintiff's personal knowledge, it also appears substantively deficient. Charbonnet v. 
Malveaux, No. 15-799, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25863, 2017 WL 740337 (M.D. La. Feb. 24, 2017) at *1 (to meet the Fed. R. Civ. 
P. 56 standards for affidavits, verification must be based on an affiant's personal knowledge, and verification based on 
""knowledge, information and belief"" is insufficient) (quoting Fowler v. S. Bell Tel. & Tel. Co., 343 F.2d 150, 154 (5th Cir. 
1965))."
434,8," R. Doc. 1. As more fully set forth in the January 17, 2019 Ruling at R. Doc. 4, the Court denied Plaintiff's application for a TRO

435,21," Plaintiff sets forth a lengthy recitation of the alleged historical treatment of the Atakapa, the Freedman's Bank, the 
Compromise of 1877, the production of currency by the U.S. Dept. of the Treasury's Bureau of Engraving and Printing, and other 
matters. See R. Doc. 1-2, pp. 30-36. In connection with these statements, Plaintiff references the ""Violation of Human Rights of 
[unspecified] American Aboriginals,"" the ""Violation of Civil Rights Act of 1871..."" and an ""Essential Facilities"" claim, but Plaintiff 
does not assert specific factual allegations alleging particularized harm in support of these claims. Rather, Plaintiff refers to

""Trademark Infringement—Temporary Restraining Order"" and ""Fraud."" R. Doc. 1-2, p. 51. However, Plaintiff has not asserted a 
claim for relief for any particular or actual trademark infringement or fraud in his Complaint, and the Court has already denied 
Plaintiff's application for a TRO. R. Doc. 4. Rather, Plaintiff only vaguely alleges that he owns the mark ""and that he may be 
entitled to a TRO and injunction if anyone commences use of such mark in the future. Plaintiff also vaguely claims that the 
federal and state governments know that the Atakapa are indigenous peoples, and that the ""transfer"" of the Atakapa ""into United 
States Citizenship, Louisiana Residency, or ward and under false names such as African-American, Colored, Black or negroes"" 
was necessarily a fraud. R. Doc. 1-2, pp. 51-52."

] Comcast's confusion may stem from the terse proposed name of ""no economic sense,"" which does not appear to invite balancing. The test is actually more nuanced than the name suggests, and it is not meant to resolve every Section 2 
challenge. As Werden sensibly notes, its ""utility ... ultimately is apt to vary,"" and we ""should not presume that a single test must 
resolve every exclusionary conduct case."" Werden at 421 & n.31. Furthermore, it has been observed that although the ""no economic sense"" test ""offers good insights into when aggressive 
actions by a single firm go too far,"" it ""can lead to erroneous results unless"" one also ""seek[s] to 'balance' gains to the monopolist 
against losses to consumers, rivals, or others."" Areeda & Hovenkamp ¶ 651b3, at 106-07. Otherwise we could arrive at absurd 
outcomes: ""Theoretically, an act might benefit the defendant very slightly while doing considerable harm to the rest of the 
economy, and it would be lawful."" Id. It is possible the test could be adapted to meet these criticisms, given that a court should 
not consider any gain from eliminating competition, but—in any event—the ""no economic sense test"" was not intended to 
displace all other approaches. Rather, it ""is likely to be most useful as one part of a sufficient condition: If challenged conduct 
has a tendency to eliminate competition and would make no economic sense but for that tendency, the conduct is exclusionary."" 
Werden at 418. Areeda and Hovenkamp also suggest a broader approach, in which harm ""wholly disproportionate"" to the valid 
business justification can also support a refusal-to-deal-claim. ¶ 772c2, at 223 (""Condemnation would be appropriate only for 
conduct that (1) clearly injures an actual or prospective rival either (2a) with no good business justification at all, or (2b) with a 
business justification that is poorly fitted to the result or wholly disproportionate to the harm that is inflicted.""). "

has recently reiterated this balancing test for a rule of reason § 1 case: ""To determine whether a restraint violates the rule of 
reason ... a three-step, burden-shifting framework applies. Under this framework, the plaintiff has the initial burden to prove that 
the challenged restraint has a substantial anticompetitive effect that harms consumers in the relevant market. If the plaintiff 
carries its burden, then the burden shifts to the defendant to show a pro-competitive rationale for the restraint. If the defendant 
makes this showing, then the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to demonstrate that the procompetitive efficiencies could be 
reasonably achieved through less anticompetitive means."" Ohio v. American Express Co., 138 S. Ct. 2274, 2284, 201 L. Ed. 2d

512,17," The partial dissent insists that that there was no conditioning and that ""RCN and WOW! maintained the ability to deal directly 
with Comcast and access the Interconnect without any ad representative should they choose not to employ Comcast."" Post at 
118-19 This is wrong as a matter of fact. As described above, every party involved—Comcast, RCN, and WOW!—understood 
that RCN and WOW! would be unable to access the Interconnects unless they hired Comcast to provide ad rep services. Even 
though its reasoning relies on the possibility that RCN and WOW! could access the Interconnects without Viamedia or Comcast, 
the partial dissent points to no evidence supporting that possibility. The record contains evidence of the opposite: RCN and 
WOW! needed to employ an ad rep services provider, and once Comcast refused to deal through their chosen intermediary, 
they had no practical choice but to obtain ad rep services from Comcast. As described above, substantial evidence shows that 
both RCN and WOW! understood themselves to be forced by Comcast into purchasing its ad rep services. A215 n.81. We 
cannot affirm summary judgment by overlooking that evidence about the realities of the parties' dealings and the economic 
realities of the market. "
514,18," The partial dissent incorrectly looks to arrangements in other geographic markets to draw conclusions about forcing in the 
relevant markets. Post at 132-33. The ad rep services and Interconnect markets are distinct for each DMA. Viamedia's tying "
515,," allegations and evidence focused on Comcast's conduct in Chicago, Detroit, and Hartford. The fact that Comcast did not 
simultaneously monopolize or attempt to monopolize ad rep services in other geographic markets is not a defense to its 
monopolization of Chicago, Detroit, and Hartford. The dissent's only support for its novel market-aggregating approach comes 
from a calculation of profit sacrifice in Novell, 731 F.3d at 1077, which has nothing to do with market definition or tying. See post

522,22," Viamedia offered Dr. Lys as an expert on damages issues. The only basis for excluding his opinion was that he assumed that 
Comcast's conduct had violated the antitrust laws and thus caused Viamedia cognizable harm, and the court had concluded that 
Viamedia could not legally prevail on its antitrust claims. As we are reversing the district court's legal rulings, the court's 
exclusion of Dr. Lys' expert opinion must also be reversed. "
524,1," This court has characterized this common business practice of vertical integration or disintermediation as pro-competitive and 
efficient. See Jack Walters & Sons Corp. v. Morton Bldg., Inc., 737 F.2d 698, 710 (7th Cir. 1984) (holding ""vertical integration 
usually is procompetitive""). "
525,2," The majority opinion reviews vertical integration and disintermediation cases cited by Comcast and concludes they are 
inapposite here on the question of procompetitive conduct. See Majority op. at pp. 63-67. While it does not change my 
agreement with the majority to remand the refusal-to-deal claim, I do not reach this same conclusion. "
527,3," See Gov't's Br. in Supp. of Neither Party at 6, 8-11, ECF No. 33 (arguing only limited circumstances have been recognized in 
which a monopolist violates § 2 by refusing to deal with a rival, and those circumstances are tightly circumscribed due to the 
negatives of coerced dealing; recommending this court follow Novell and its test that a refusal to deal does not violate § 2 
""unless it would make no economic sense for the defendant but for its tendency to eliminate or lessen competition""). "
529,4," The leading treatise acknowledges the possibility that a rival could have standing if an illegal tying arrangement creates, 
enlarges, or perpetuates a monopoly for a tied product, and that rival may be foreclosed if it loses existing market share or sales. 
But ""[i]njury to the foreclosed rival occurs, of course, only because a tie has forced buyers to purchase the defendant's tied 
product rather than the rival's."" 10 Areeda & Hovenkamp, ANTITRUST LAW ¶ 1767a, p. 449. This is a high bar: the rival must show 
(a) a monopoly in the tied-market, (b) the loss of its existing market share or sales (not limited to certain customers), and (c) an 
injury based only on buyers being forced to purchase defendant's product over their own. "
530,5," Even if somehow Viamedia could be considered a foreclosed rival with antitrust injury and standing, the leading treatise notes 
the possibility of injunctive relief—which the district court correctly concluded was misplaced on these facts, 335 F. Supp. 3d at 
1074—and that treatise observes how difficult it is in such a circumstance to prove damages without speculation. 10 Areeda & "
531,," Hovenkamp, ANTITRUST LAW ¶ 1767a, p. 450 (""Even for those established in the market, estimating the number of sales lost as a 
result of the tying arrangement is elusive at best.""). Viamedia's status as a foreclosed rival, though, would depend on the existence of a tie. I conclude below the undisputed facts 
show no evidence of tying conduct because there was no conditioned sale of services. "
532,6," The majority opinion relies on certain factual assumptions to attempt to distinguish Aerotec. First, the majority assumes ""this is not a typical bundling case,"" Majority op. at 77, so Aerotec should not control. But Aerotec 
provides an instructive framework for determining whether a tie has occurred and illustrates the important role that conditioning 
plays in an unlawful tying arrangement, see 836 F.3d at 1179. Second, the majority assumes ""self-providing ad rep services was not a viable option for RCN and WOW!,"" Majority op. at 78, 
and so they ""needed to employ [a third-party] ad rep services provider."" Id. at 77 n.17. As discussed elsewhere in this opinion, 
infra at 134, this assumption relies on the majority opinion's conclusion that it must not have been economically feasible for RCN 
and WOW! to internalize ad representation, either regionally or locally. This is not supported by the record, which contains 
undisputed evidence of various economically feasible options MVPDs choose in structuring their advertising sales. See infra at 
25-26. Regardless, this assumption does not prevent Aerotec's application here. Third, the majority assumes RCN and WOW! had ""no choice but to obtain ad rep services from Comcast,"" Majority op. at 34 n.8, 
and were ""forced by Comcast"" to do so. Id. at 77 n.17. This in turn assumes that RCN and WOW! did not want ad representation 
services from Comcast. But the evidence shows the opposite: neither RCN nor WOW! ever requested Interconnect-only services 
from Comcast, and both sought full-turnkey relationships with Comcast to receive ad representation and Interconnect services 
together. Ultimately, Comcast's and Viamedia's offers to solicit RCN's and WOW!'s business were ""nowhere near equal,"" and it 
was ""not a very difficult decision"" for the MVPDs to make. 335 F. Supp. 3d at 1048. Comcast was able to offer superior terms 
and better prices with full Interconnect access and ad representation services. The assumption that any MVPD was forced or 
threatened to purchase ad representation services to gain access to the Interconnects does not follow from the evidence and is 
not a distinguishing factor from Aerotec. "
533,7," The majority opinion casts Comcast's refusal to deal as a negative fact, noting that Comcast ""conceded repeatedly"" that it had 
done so. Majority op. at p. 76. It is undisputed that Comcast refused to deal with Viamedia; the question on remand is whether 
that refusal was anticompetitive, which Viamedia will have to prove. As discussed, refusals to deal are now not disfavored, and 
in fact the opposite—cooperation among rivals—is a red flag under antitrust law. See Easterbrook, The Chicago School & 
Exclusionary Conduct, at 442 (""cooperation is to be feared rather than welcomed""). "
534,8," Further, if tying occurred, one would expect to see higher prices or lower output. See Washington Legal Foundation's Br. in 
Supp. of Def. at 12, ECF No. 45. There is no such evidence here. "
551,1," Justice Don Willett, writing for the Texas Supreme Court, subsequently set out the circumstances giving rise to this case: This case arises in part from historic litigation that buffeted the tobacco industry in the last decade of the twentieth century. 
The Lone Star State was a significant player in that litigation. Just over twenty years ago, Texas sued several of the nation's 
leading tobacco companies, asserting violations of numerous state and federal fraud, racketeering, antitrust, conspiracy, 
and other laws. Texas's claims were that these companies knowingly misrepresented their products as safe and targeted minors in their 
advertisements. More than 40 states filed similar suits against the tobacco industry. The companies' collective defense 
faltered, however, when one of the companies, Liggett, settled with Texas and several other states (the Liggett Settlement), 
agreeing in large part to cooperate with the states in their suits against the remaining defendants. Hegar v. Tex. Small Tobacco Coal., 496 S.W.3d 778, 781 (Tex. 2016) (Willett, J.)."
551,2," Approximately 16,000,000,000 cigarettes are manufactured and sold every year under these four brands. "
552,3," While PMUSA is formally postured as a defendant to the underlying civil litigation, PMUSA joins Texas' effort to enforce the 
Texas Settlement. Accordingly, in this Order, the Court will use the designation ""Defendants"" to refer collectively to only Imperial 
and Reynolds, who jointly oppose the motions urged by Texas and PMUSA."
552,4," At the joint request of the parties, the Court previously issued an order bifurcating the issue of liability under the Texas 
Settlement from an issue related to the relative allocation of payment obligations between the settling defendants—an issue 
primarily advanced by PMUSA, as the party whose relative payment obligations have been allegedly distorted as a result of the 
sale of the Acquired Brands. See Bifurcation Order, Dkt. No. 2328. Since this Order determines that Reynolds remains liable 
under the Texas Settlement for the payments on the Acquired Brands, the remaining issue related to profit adjustment now 
appears moot. The Court will invite additional briefing on the disposition of the profit adjustment issue in a separate order filed 
contemporaneously herewith. "
553,5," As a result of mergers and acquisitions, the majority of these manufacturers no longer exist as they did when this action was 
commenced. The only remaining settling defendants are PMUSA and Reynolds."
553,6," Justice Don Willett, writing for a unanimous Texas Supreme Court. "
554,7," As used herein, the Court will refer to the original settlement along with the two amendments collectively as the ""Texas 
Settlement."" "
557,8, Antitrust clearance from the Department of Justice was conditioned on the sale of the Acquired Brands.
557,9," The assignment of the Acquired Brands included transfer of then-existing raw tobacco, tobacco farmland, brand-related 
intellectual property, existing fabricated cigarettes, and other related assets."
557,10," The ""Assumed Liabilities"" are expressly set forth in the APA."
557,11," Imperial failed to undertake ""the obligations of a Settling Defendant"" by ""the Closing"" of the APA in 2015. That failure is the 
subject of a breach of contract action between Reynolds and Imperial, and is presently pending before the Chancery Court of 
Delaware. See also  [**36]  ITG Brands, LLC v. Reynolds Am.,Inc., No. CV 2017-0129-AGB, 2017 Del. Ch. LEXIS 819, 2017 WL

558,," ""reasonable best efforts"" terminated as of the date when the APA closed). Reynolds is also seeking indemnity for any judgment 
against it levied under the PSS Agreements, including the Texas Settlement."
558,12," At the hearing before this Court, Reynolds disagreed that Texas had rejected Imperial's offer to join the Texas Settlement. 
However, in the Chancery Court of Delaware, Imperial described the interaction with Texas as follows: [I]n Texas we gave them a draft joinder in January 2015. We had some conversations with it in April 2015 in which it said, 
you know, essentially you got to go get Philip Morris involved here because we don't think you can join without Philip Morris' 
consent. And we never heard another word from Texas until a demand letter in August of 2018, this year. [**37] Del. 6/4/19 Hearing Tr. at 37:20-38:3, ITG Brands, LLC v. Reynolds Am. Inc., C.A. No. 2017-0129-AGB (Del. Ch. June 4, 
2019). Texas described the interaction similarly before this Court: After we met in 2014 with [Imperial] and with Reynolds, you know, the State did have concerns about the method that 
[Imperial] was proposing to join because it did not comport with the method that is actually contained in the contract itself, in 
the settlement agreement for that -- you know, to make that change, to insert a new party into the Texas Settlement 
Agreement. Hearing Tr., Dkt. No. 2354 at 15:12-18. Counsel for Reynolds, by contrast, told this Court that Texas actually never responded. 
In the hearing before this Court, Reynolds told the Court that Texas had not responded at all. The following colloquy occurred 
between counsel for Reynolds and the Court: COUNSEL FOR REYNOLDS: The State was put on notice of the pending transaction in 2014 prior to -- put on notice by 
[Imperial] -- THE COURT: But it's also uncontested that the State did not consent, correct? COUNSEL FOR REYNOLDS: Your Honor, the State did not consent, and to -- to Reynolds's knowledge, the State did not 
respond. Id. at 43:10-17. The Court has no reason to believe counsel for Reynolds was intentionally misspeaking. However, the Court 
also has no basis to believe that the substantively identical descriptions from Texas and Imperial are incorrect."
558,13," One primary reason that the Texas Settlement required the consent of all parties before a joinder could occur is that the 
payment framework of the Texas Settlement is relative. While Texas receives approximately the same amount of money each 
year, the distribution of payment burdens among the settling defendants can vary substantially. As detailed later in this Order, 
the joinder order proposed by Reynolds and Imperial could have distorted their payment obligations in a manner that would 
proportionately increase PMUSA's obligations (and concomitantly decrease Reynolds' obligations). "
559,14," Though payments to Texas and Texas' Private Counsel are calculated by reference to the same base number of cigarettes, 
the payments due to Texas are calculated by reference to a higher percentage rate than the payments to Texas' Private 
Counsel."
559,15," PMUSA neither sought nor received discovery, ostensibly because any such documents had already been exchanged twice 
over in PMUSA's related disputes with Imperial and Reynolds in Florida and Minnesota. "
560,16, See supra n.4 (describing the bifurcation order and process). 
561,17," Indeed, the scope of obligations imposed by the term ""reasonable best efforts"" is an issue of construction presently pending 
before the Delaware Chancery Court. Depending on the Delaware Chancery Court's construction of ""reasonable best efforts,"" "
562,," such term may furnish an independent basis for Imperial to be liable for payments under the Texas Settlement. See infra Section 
III.F; Part IV."
562,18," The Minnesota Court entertained motions for summary judgment under a holding of the Minnesota Supreme Court, which 
provides that ""HN5[
] [a] district court 'shall treat a motion to enforce a settlement agreement as it would a motion for summary 
judgment.'"" Minn. Ct. Judgment, Dkt. No. 2344-1 at 11 (quoting Voicestream Minneapolis, Inc. v. RPC Props., Inc., 743 N.W.2d 
267, 273 (Minn. 2008)). "
564,19," As used here, a ""brand transfer"" provision refers to an express provision prohibiting a settling defendant from transferring 
cigarettes or cigarette brands. Reynolds and Imperial contended that since the Master Settlement Agreement contained an 
explicit ""brand transfer"" provision, while the Minnesota Settlement Agreement did not contain a ""brand transfer"" provision, the 
Court should infer that ""the intent of the parties in the resolution of the Minnesota Lawsuit was to allow for the Settling Parties to 
transfer their brands and extinguish their liability for future settlement payments."" Minn. Ct. Judgment, Dkt. No. 2344-1 at 17. "
565,20," This issue—the distortion of profit adjustment and payment allocation—is the basis upon which Texas refused to consent to 
Imperial's attempt to join the Texas Settlement without first securing the consent of PMUSA. The existence of the Mississippi 
litigation shows that Texas' concerns were real and substantial."
565,21," To avoid the issues of link rot and reference rot, the Court uses a persistent identifier link to archive the public docket for the 
Mississippi litigation, as available at the time this Order is issued. See, e.g., Christine L. Borgman, Open Data, Grey Data, and 
Stewardship: Universities at the Privacy Frontier, 33 Berkeley Tech. L.J. 365, 378 n.34 (2018) (highlighting the importance of 
""persistent identifiers"" that are able to permanently ""'resolve to a location' online,"" in order ""to facilitate access in addition to 
identification""). "
567,22," Minnesota law does not suggest any preclusive effect is appropriate with respect to the issues raised by enforcement of the 
Texas Settlement. HN17[
] Minnesota squarely assigns ""the burden to establish"" that collateral estoppel is applicable to ""[t]he 
party asserting collateral estoppel."" Mach v. Wells Concrete Prod. Co., 866 N.W.2d 921, 927 (Minn. 2015) (quoting Lange v. City "
568,," of Byron, 255 N.W.2d 226, 228 (Minn. 1977)). Imperial has not carried that burden, given that Imperial does not urge that the 
Minnesota Court's Judgment should be given preclusive effect. Further, Imperial could not carry its burden under Minnesota law 
for one of the same reasons its claim fails under Florida law—Minnesota limits issue preclusion to circumstances where the 
""issue was identical to one in a prior adjudication,"" and the issues before the Minnesota court are merely analogous to the issues 
before this Court, rather than identical to the issues presented herein. See id. (citing Nelson v. Am. Family Ins. Grp., 651 
N.W.2d 499, 511 (Minn. 2002)). At issue in the Minnesota Court was the Minnesota Settlement, read in light of Minnesota law; 
at issue in this Texas federal court is the Texas Settlement, read in light of Texas law. This point is sufficient to reject application 
of any form of preclusion. "
570,23," Reynolds' representations to the Mississippi Court about PwC's role are relevant to the Texas Settlement because PwC was 
engaged with a single engagement letter for all four Previously Settled States, and because each PSS Agreement reflects the 
same allocation of responsibility between the courts and the accountants. PwC Engagement Letter, Dkt. No. 2357-5. Reynolds' 
description of PwC's role with respect to the Mississippi Settlement is accordingly informative of PwC's role with respect to the 
Texas Settlement, because PwC plays the same accounting role for both Mississippi and Texas under the terms of the 
engagement letter and the two respective states' settlement agreements. "
571,24," The Texas Settlement establishes certain preset values from the year 1997 as the ""base year"" for reference and comparison 
during each year annually thereafter. The sales of the Acquired Brands remain included in the base year for Reynolds."
571,25," This does not mean, however, that PwC is responsible for determining the legal issue bifurcated by the Court, which goes to 
whether—as a legal matter—the Acquired Brands remain proper for inclusion in the reference base year of 1997, if liability for 
those brands is assigned to Imperial. Though more closely related to the role PwC, that issue too is an issue for the Court, and 
turns on an interpretation of the Texas Settlement. "
572,26," Reynolds has gone to great lengths to dispute this characterization, claiming that its argument is not that the obligation to pay 
disappears, but rather that Reynolds never had an obligation to pay on the Acquired Brands in the first place—its obligations 
were limited to cigarettes it sold, pursuant to the Market Share provision, and since it no longer sells the Acquired Brands, its 
obligation no longer extends to those cigarettes. See Hearing Tr., Dkt. No. 2354 at 42:6-10 (""I'd like to frame our argument 
thusly, which is that Reynolds does not claim that any obligation has been extinguished but rather that liability is calculated on 
brands -- on cigarettes sold by Reynolds, not brands previously owned by Reynolds.""). The Court recognizes why Reynolds 
seeks to frame its argument in that manner, but concludes that such framing obscures the crux of the issue: according to 
Reynolds, it was obligated to pay for the Acquired Brands before the assignment but was not obligated to pay after the 
assignment. In every sense of the term, Reynolds asks the Court to hold that the obligation to pay for the Acquired Brands is 
extinguished by means of Reynolds' assignment to Imperial. The Court declines to so hold. "
574,27," With respect to the former rationale, Reynolds' willingness to meet its less expensive obligations—but not its costlier ones—is 
no basis to avoid liability. The latter rationale is similarly unavailing, both as a factual and legal matter. Texas' rights (and its 
performance under the Texas Settlement) had ""accrued"" with the execution of the Texas Settlement. By the covenants in the 
Texas Settlement, Texas then and thereby released the settling defendants from liability, in perpetuity. That release was Texas' 
performance, and its rights vested contemporaneously thereto: Texas then became entitled to payments as set out in the Texas 
Settlement. If the rights of Texas' Private Counsel had already accrued, then so too had the rights of Texas."
574,28," Eland's argument with respect to ""Participating Interest"" is much like Reynolds' argument concerning the Market Share 
calculations called for in the Texas Settlement. "
575,29," In addition to its general rule, which the Court relies upon, Seagull also recognizes that ""[HN22[
] e]ven when the contract 
does not expressly provide for the consequences resulting from the assignment of one's interest, the contract's subject or other 
circumstances may indicate that obligations were not intended to survive assignment."" Seagull, 207 S.W.3d at 347. Like the 
defendant in Seagull, Reynolds does not argue here that the Texas Settlement's ""subject or other circumstances"" imply that it 
should be released of its obligations after assignment. Just as the Seagull defendant could have paid money to fulfill its 
obligations under the applicable operating agreement after it assigned its leasehold interests, Reynolds could pay money after 
its assignment of the Acquired Brands, in order to fulfill its obligations to Texas. There is nothing about the subject or 
circumstances of the Texas Settlement that implies, in any way, that Reynolds should be released from obligations upon the 
transfer of the Acquired Brands. In this regard, and otherwise, Seagull is on all fours with the instant case. Without an express 
release from Texas—and there is none—the assignment by Reynolds does not allow it to escape its existing obligations under 
the Texas Settlement. "
576,30," For over a century, the Supreme Court of Texas, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, and the United States Supreme Court have 
all repeatedly cited Fletcher's Cyclopedia as an authoritative treatise on the law of corporations and corporate liability. The Texas 
Supreme Court has even disapproved of Texas intermediate appellate courts on the basis of inconsistency with Fletcher's 
Cyclopedia. See Texam Oil Corp. v. Poynor, 436 S.W.2d 129, 130 & n.2 (Tex. 1968) (following ""[t]he rule which Fletcher says is 
'the better and majority rule,'"" and accordingly disapproving a decision from a Texas intermediate appellate court). "
577,31," The Court does not interpret Reynolds' and Imperial's submission of parol evidence related to the Texas Comptroller to 
suggest that Texas consented to release Reynolds from its obligations under the Texas Settlement. However, to the extent 
Reynolds and Imperial ask the Court to draw that inference as a factual matter, the Court finds that the relevant parol evidence 
does not suggest that Texas consented to release Reynolds. See infra Section III.D.2.d. Further, the actions of the Texas 
Comptroller's employees cannot effectuate a release under the Texas Settlement, because the Texas Settlement provides that 
any waiver of rights must be made in a writing. See Texas Settlement, Dkt. No. 2222-1 at 24 § 23. "
578,32," To avoid duplication, the Court sets out its analysis of specific textual indicators in the Texas Settlement below, in Section 
III.D.2.b. For the reasons set out therein, the following textual provisions specifically support the Court's conclusion that finality 
was an intended business purpose of the Texas Settlement: Section III.D.2.b.ii (discussing payments-in-perpetuity terms); 
Section III.D.2.b.iii (discussing successors-and-assigns term); Section III.D.2.b.v (discussing prior written consent term). "
579,33," Reynolds' interpretation would permit settling defendants to completely avoid all existing obligations under the Texas 
Settlement while retaining all, or virtually all, of the profit from those cigarette sales. Consider the following scenario: if this Court 
adopts Reynolds' theory of the Texas Settlement, Reynolds (or PMUSA for that matter) could create a distinct corporate entity 
(""ReynoldsSub""). Reynolds could assign ownership of all of its cigarettes to ReynoldsSub, while maintaining its status as the 
sole shareholder in ReynoldsSub. As the sole shareholder, Reynolds would maintain complete control over the issuance of 
dividends by ReynoldsSub, permitting Reynolds to reap the profit from the sales of its cigarettes. Further, its status as sole 
shareholder would leave Reynolds in control of the organization and conduct of ReynoldsSub, despite the observation of 
corporate formalities between the two. Under Reynolds' theory, ReynoldsSub would not be an ""assign"" within the meaning of the Texas Settlement, since it only 
possesses Reynolds' brands, cigarettes, and intellectual property—not any of Reynolds' rights or obligations under the Texas 
Settlement. If the Court adopted Reynolds' construction of the Texas Settlement, liability for all of those cigarettes simply goes 
up in smoke, since the Market Share provision applies only to direct sales by Reynolds, and the cigarettes would be sold by 
ReynoldsSub. If Texas (or Minnesota, Mississippi, and Florida) wished to collect repayment for the damage caused by the sale 
of those tobacco products sold by ReynoldsSub, the several states would have to file an entirely new lawsuit. This scenario is neither idle nor hypothetical. As noted above, PMUSA candidly informed the Court that if the Court creates a 
legitimate path by which it may avoid its Texas Settlement obligations, it will do so. In light of its duties to its shareholders, why 
wouldn't it? The Texas Settlement imposes sizeable financial obligations on the settling defendants, and Texas would face 
serious practical obstacles if it was forced to file a new lawsuit and redo the work of the Texas Settlement. See supra Section 
III.D.2.b.ii (describing ""problems of proof"" related to causation and damages that would arise out of the existence of the Texas 
Settlement). Forcing Texas into a redo-scenario easily leaves the settling defendants far better off than they are under the yoke 
of the Texas Settlement. This scenario, or a comparable scenario organized to the same end, is a natural result of adopting the 
construction urged by Reynolds. To permit such a scenario is to end the Texas Settlement. The Court finds that such a result 
would be oppressive, inequitable, and unreasonable. According, application of that canon of construction strongly favors 
continuing liability under the Texas Settlement on this basis. "
580,34," This principle follows from the fact that tobacco-related illnesses may manifest at unpredictable times and in unpredictable 
ways. "
582,35," As noted above, the Court finds that ""annually thereafter"" is unambiguous on its face. However, for the purpose of argument, 
to the extent ""annually thereafter"" might elsewhere be read as ambiguous, the Court alternatively makes the following factual 
findings that the phrase ""annually thereafter"" was understood by the parties to the Texas Settlement as imposing payment 
obligations in perpetuity. First, there is a uniform course of performance from the settling defendants which shows that Texas Settlement payments are 
ongoing. Both Reynolds and PMUSA—the only remaining settling defendants—continue to make Texas Settlement payments 
for all of their brands (with the obvious exclusion that Reynolds has stopped making payments on the Acquired Brands). Second, in documents filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, Reynolds documented its 
understanding that the Texas Settlement ""imposed future payment obligations in perpetuity on RJR Tobacco, B&W, 
Lorillard Tobacco and other major U.S. cigarette manufacturers."" Reynolds 2015 Form 10-K, Dkt. No. 2222-8 at 111 (emphasis 
added). These statements were made prior to the present litigation, in a context where Reynolds had a legal obligation to make 
accurate statements. The Court credits them as such. Those statements are also consistent with the position taken under oath by Reynolds' then-CEO Andrew J. Schindler that 
payment obligations under the Texas Settlement last ""forever."" Schindler Fla. Trial Testimony, Dkt. No. 2222-9 at 54711:25-
54712:4 (""Q. Do Reynolds' obligations stop after 25 years under the MSA and the other four agreements? A. No, they don't. Q. 
How long do they go on? A. Forever."") (emphasis added). Other Reynolds executives took an identical position under oath. 
See, e.g., Orlowsky Fla Trial Testimony, Dkt. No. 2222-10 at 55899:16-55900:7 (""Q: Let's start with the MSA and other state 
agreements. . . . Q. Do your financial obligations under those agreements end after 25 years? A. No, they do not. They go on "
583,," forever ."") (emphasis added). In view of the foregoing, the Court factually finds that the term ""annually thereafter"" was 
understood by the parties to impose an obligation to make Texas Settlement payments in perpetuity."
583,36," The inclusion of an adjustment for inflation is also additional evidence that the signatories to the Texas Settlement understood 
that payments would be made in perpetuity—if payments were only intended to be made for a relatively short period of time, 
there would be a correspondingly lessened need to include an adjustment for inflation. While the inclusion of this term is not 
determinative of the duration of payments, it remains additional evidence consistent with an ongoing payment arrangement. "
584,37," See Tex. Indus., 218 F.2d at 512-13 (citing Kamm v. Pritchard, 296 F. 871, 872 (5th Cir. 1924) (""[W]here the owners of 
timberland and lumber mills had contracted with the plaintiffs to sell to them all of their output of lumber, the Fifth Circuit held 
that, although the contract contained no covenant by defendants not to sell their entire lumber operation, the contract was 
nevertheless enforceable by the plaintiff, and damages were recoverable."")); see also, e.g., id. (citing Wells v. Alexandre, 85 
Sickels 642, 130 N.Y. 642, 29 N.E. 142, 3 Silv. A. 594 (1891) (""In Wells v. Alexandre, the court held that the sale of steamers 
after making a contract for the supply of coal to them for one year did not relieve the original owners from the obligation to take 
the coal that the ordinary and accustomed use of the steamers required."" (internal citation omitted))). "
588,38," Reynolds also attempted to distinguish the payments to Private Counsel from the payments to Texas, on the basis that the 
payments to Private Counsel are less expensive because they ""do not exist in perpetuity."" Hearing Tr., Dkt. No. 2354 at 123:8-
124:19; see also, e.g., id. at 124:11-14 (""So I understand the inconsistency there, but when we're talking, again, about forward- "
589,," looking payments, these -- these in a few years, a relatively few years as -- as against perpetuity, then those obligations will 
cease.""). The Court summarily rejects this argument, which is not an appropriate basis of distinction."
589,39," Despite relying on the actions of the Texas Comptroller's employees, Imperial and Reynolds spend no time arguing the 
antecedent question of whether this evidence is cognizable under Texas law. Despite a need to do so, Imperial and Reynolds 
simply do not address whether several employees of the Texas Comptroller may bind Texas to a course of performance. "
592,40," The APA is construed pursuant to Delaware law. See infra Part IV. Accordingly, the Court relies on a Delaware Chancery 
Court opinion in setting out the plain textual meaning of ""defense."" Further, while the Court defers to the Delaware Chancery 
Court for all fact-bound interpretation of any ambiguous provisions of the APA, the Court finds that § 2.01(a)(v) is unambiguous 
in transferring the ""defense"" of release for the Acquired Brands to Imperial. Accordingly, the Court reaches the meaning of § 
2.01(a)(v)."
592,41," The APA includes a provision which states: ""Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to 
assign, directly or indirectly, any Transferred Asset or any claim or right or any benefit arising thereunder or resulting 
therefrom if an attempted direct or indirect assignment or transfer thereof, without the consent of a third party, would 
constitute a breach, default, violation or other contravention thereof, would be ineffective with respect to any party to an 
agreement concerning such Transferred Asset, claim or right or would in any way adversely affect the rights of the Acquiror 
or the Sellers (as applicable) thereto or thereunder, and such consent has not been obtained on or prior to the Closing 
Date."" APA, Dkt. No. 2222-6 at 5 art. II § 2.02(a). While inartfully drafted, the import of this provision is to disclaim any assignment of 
any right or asset if such assignment would be a breach of any contract or ""would in any way adversely affect the rights"" of 
Reynolds or Imperial. While this might hypothetically have limited the transfer of any defenses, Reynolds and Imperial do not 
press the applicability of this provision. Indeed, given that two courts have found Reynolds liable for breach of contract based on 
the transfer of the Acquired Brands, a faithful application of this provision would suggest that the assignment of the Acquired 
Brands was itself ineffective. Since neither Reynolds nor Imperial appear to desire that result, it appears they have made the 
strategic choice not to assert this provision as a limitation that the Court should consider when construing the APA, despite 
spending considerable time discussing whether various assignments under the APA constitute a breach of contract. To the 
extent Reynolds and Imperial wished to press the position that § 2.02(a) limited transfers, it would necessarily require both 
parties to argue that the transfers of the Acquired Brands and related assets were not actually effective. Imperial and Reynolds 
had ample opportunity to argue that § 2.02(a) limited their liability and declined to do so. Accordingly, given the apparently "
593,," strategic choice made by Reynolds and Imperial not to discuss this issue, the Court finds any argument based on this provision 
waived. See Firefighters' Ret. Sys. v. Grant Thornton, LLP, 894 F.3d 665, 670 n.18 (5th Cir. 2018) (""[HN41[
] A]n argument not 
raised before the district court cannot be asserted the first time on appeal""); Dallas Gas Partners, L.P. v. Prospect Energy Corp., 
733 F.3d 148, 156-57 (5th Cir. 2013) (""If a party fails to assert a legal reason why [relief] should . . . be granted, that ground is 
waived and cannot be considered or raised on appeal.""); Maverick Recording Co. v. Harper, 598 F.3d 193, 197 (5th Cir. 2010) 
(holding that a party ""waived her constitutional challenge by failing to raise it [in the district court] in a manner that would 
allow the [**143]  district court to rule on it""); Kelly v. Foti, 77 F.3d 819, 823 (5th Cir. 1996) (""[The] raising party must present 
the issue so that it places the opposing party and the court on notice that a new issue is being raised"")."
593,42," Texas Business Corporations Act article 5.10(B) is the predecessor statute to Texas Business Organizations Code § 10.254. 
Despite stylistic wording differences between the two statutes, Texas courts have interpreted article 5.10(B) and § 10.254 
identically. In re 1701 Commerce, LLC, 511 B.R. 812, 823 (Bankr. N.D. Tex. 2014) (citing E-Quest Mgmt., LLC v. Shaw, 433

597,1," Plaintiff first named White Cap Construction Supply, Inc. as the defendant in this matter but then filed an amended complaint to 
correct the name to HD Supply Construction, Ltd., d/b/a HD Supply Construction & Industrial—White Cap. The Court refers to 
Defendant as White Cap throughout this order. "
598,2," In September 2018, well after the filing of this lawsuit, ACS closed its Florida location because of poor sales performance with 
SureBuilT. (Dkts. 73-1 ¶ 5; 78-1 ¶ 93.) Many customers chose not to use SureBuilT, a less well-established tilt construction 
manufacturer. (Dkts. 73-3 ¶ 86; 78-1 ¶ 86.) In its statement of facts, ACS also includes various facts about its unsuccessful 
performance in Florida, but those facts are immaterial to the Court's determination. (See, e.g., Dkt. 73-3 ¶¶ 79-92.) "
599,3," ACS often cites deposition testimony and declarations from two of its employees to support its statement of facts. Much of this 
hearsay support comes from what ACS's employees claim another person told them, however. The Court disregards these 
unsupported hearsay statements. In any case, ""self-serving hearsay . . . has no probative value on summary judgment."" Kirkland 
v. Tamplin, 285 Ga. App. 241, 645 S.E.2d 653, 656 (Ga. Ct. App. 2007)."
599,4," Because ACS claims (without record evidence) Wolstenholme made the decision, it does not directly address White Cap's facts 
about Crawford's reasons for ending the relationship. "
600,5," Since the filing of the complaint, ACS has ""quietly"" shuttered its Florida office. The Florida market now includes two statewide 
tilt distributors, White Cap and Construction Materials. (Dkt. 73-1 ¶ 33.) "
603,6," A court assessing a claim under § 2 of the Sherman Act must first determine the relevant market and whether the defendant 
possessed monopoly power in that market. The Court has not done so here because, even assuming White Cap possessed that 
power in the relevant market, ACS cannot prevail on its claim because White Cap (and Meadow Burke) have proffered a valid 
business justification for their actions and ACS has not shown that reason to be a pretext for illegal activity."
603,7," ACS does not blame White Cap for its decision to close its Florida office and concedes that White Cap has done nothing to 
prevent ACS from selling the SureBuilT brand in Florida. (Dkts. 55-2 ¶ 31; 73-1 ¶ 31.) "
604,8," In Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc), the Eleventh Circuit adopted as binding

622,18," In Illinois Brick, several brick companies allegedly conspired to raise prices to masons who in turn passed the inflated prices 
along to the subcontractors on public works projects; ultimately harming the indirect purchasers: the state and its taxpayers. 
Illinois Brick Co., 431 U.S. at 726-27. HN16[
] The Supreme Court held that indirect purchasers may not recover damages in 
price-fixing cases and even if direct purchasers have ""passed on"" some or all the overcharges to indirect purchasers. Id. at 744-
46. As a policy matter, the Court found it necessary to restrict the remedy to direct purchasers. Id. In response to the Court's 
decision, several states enacted laws permitting indirect purchasers to sue under state antitrust laws. See Daniel R. Karon, 
""Your Honor, Tear Down That Illinois Brick Wall!"" the National Movement Toward Indirect Purchaser Antitrust Standing and 
Consumer Justice, 30 Wm. Mitchell L. Rev. 1351, 1360-63 (2004) (explaining different states Illinois Brick ""repealer statutes""); 
California v. ARC Am. Corp., 490 U.S. 93, 109 S. Ct. 1661, 104 L. Ed. 2d 86 (1989)."
622,19," It is worth noting that this statute's language is practically identical to the Clayton Act's Section 4 (damages), 15 U.S.C. § 15. "
635,1," Several district court decisions from the District of Columbia have adopted the view that a court must perform a full Daubert 
analysis before certifying a class. See, e.g., Campbell v. Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp., 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 70667,  311 F. 
Supp. 3d 281, 296 (D.D.C. 2018) (agreeing ""with the heavy weight of authority that, when a party moves to exclude expert 
testimony proffered in support of a motion for class certification, the district court must perform a full Daubert analysis before 
certifying a class); In re Rail Freight Fuel Surcharge Antitrust Litig., No. 07-0489(PLF), 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 66526, 2016 WL 
2962186, at *2 (D.D.C. May 20, 2016) (holding that the court ""will first address the relevance of all expert opinions and the 
reliability of the experts' methodology under Daubert and Rule 702, and then conduct the 'rigorous analysis' of all of the relevant 
evidence—including expert testimony that meets the Daubert [*38]  and Rule 702 standards—that is critical to proving the class 
certification requirements"" under Rule 23); Kottaras v. Whole Foods Mkt., Inc., 281 F.R.D. 16, 26 (D.D.C. 2012) (agreeing ""with 
other courts that the Rule calls for careful and searching analysis of all evidence with respect to whether Rule 23's certification 
requirements have been met, including expert opinions""). "
637,2," Plaintiffs don't challenge Dr. Blaiss's qualifications to provide expert testimony. Dr. Blaiss serves as the Executive Medical 
Director of the American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology, and he is a Clinical Professor of Pediatrics at the Medical 
College of Georgia at Augusta University in Augusta, Georgia. Doc. 1585-1 at 2 (Blaiss Expert Report ¶ 1.1). Dr. Blaiss currently 
practices as an allergist at Good Samaritan Health Center of Gwinnett in Norcross, Georgia. Id. He is the former President of the 
American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology, and he has served as an officer or board member of several other 
allergy-related organizations. Id. He is certified in Allergy & Immunology by the American Board of Allergy and Immunology and 
certified in Pediatrics by the American Board of Pediatrics. Id. at 3 (Blaiss Expert Report ¶ 1.2). He has published more than 120 
scientific peer-reviewed articles and presented at more than 500 meetings and seminars throughout the world, including 
presentations about anaphylaxis. Id. (Blaiss Expert Report ¶ 1.3). The court finds that Dr. Blaiss is sufficiently qualified to render 
the opinions he offers in his Expert Report. "
638,3," The putative class plaintiffs assert that Prof. Hughes is not a health economist. Doc. 1852 at 6. They contend that his current 
teaching and recent publications involve subjects other than the pharmaceutical industry. And, they allege, other courts have 
rejected some of Prof. Hughes's opinions. Id. at 8. But plaintiffs never argue that Prof. Hughes isn't qualified to provide expert 
testimony. Defendants respond that plaintiffs have mischaracterized Prof. Hughes's resume and the way courts have considered 
his expert opinions in other cases. The court finds that plaintiffs' criticisms of Prof. Hughes's academic work and other expert 
testimony go to the weight his opinions should receive, and not their admissibility. The court finds that Prof. Hughes, who is a 
Professor of Economics at Bates College specializing in the fields of health economics, industrial organization, law and 
economics, and labor economics, is qualified to render the expert opinions he provides. "
641,4, The court addresses Prof. Hughes's opinions in its Order on the class certification motion at Parts IV.C.1. & IV.D.3.a. 
642,5," Plaintiffs also argue that Prof. Hughes's opinions are not reliable because he limited his analysis just to the data produced in 
the case but did not consider other data from PBMs that they could provide and Prof. Hughes could use to determine 
ascertainability. These arguments go to the weight the court should give Prof. Hughes's opinions but not their admissibility."
642,6, The court addresses this question in its Order on the class certification motion at Part IV.C.1. 
643,7," Defendants don't challenge Prof. Rosenthal's qualifications. See Doc. 1850 at 10 (explaining that the ""focus"" of defendants' 
motion is challenging the methodologies that Prof. Rosenthal used to form her opinions but not her knowledge, training, 
experience, and qualifications). But, as Fed. R. Evid. 702 and Daubert require, the court finds that Prof. Rosenthal is qualified to 
render the opinions she has offered at this stage. Prof. Rosenthal is the C. Boyden Gray Professor of Health Economics and 
Policy at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Doc. 1500-3 at 4 (Rosenthal Expert Report ¶ 3). Her field of research is 
the economics of the health care industry. Id. And, at Harvard, she has taught undergraduate, Masters-level, and Ph.D.-level 
health economics and health policy courses. Id. (Rosenthal Expert Report ¶ 4). Prof. Rosenthal earned an A.B. in International 
Relations from Brown University and a Ph.D. in Health Policy (Economics Track) from Harvard University. Id. (Rosenthal Expert 
Report ¶ 6). Prof. Rosenthal has testified as an expert witness in several cases involving alleged anticompetitive conduct in the 
pharmaceutical industry. Id. at 4, 52-53 (Rosenthal Expert Report ¶ 4, Attach. A). And, she has published more than 100 peer-
reviewed journal articles, essays, and book chapters. Id. (Rosenthal Expert Report ¶ 5). Her experience and credentials qualify 
Prof. Rosenthal to provide expert testimony. "
645,8," The court addresses defendants' challenges to Professor Rosenthal's damages opinion in its Order on the class certification 
motion at Part IV.E.2.a. "
647,9, The court addresses this question in its Order on the class certification motion at Part IV.C.1.
647,10," As discussed below, only the third category of consumers qualify for class membership. Consumers in the first and second 
categories would not qualify if they never paid for their EpiPens. "
648,11," The court recognizes that the Wellbutrin court also applied the Third Circuit's ""administrative feasibility"" standard for 
determining the class's ascertainability. 308 F.R.D. at 151. Plaintiffs assert that this is not the appropriate standard for 
determining ascertainability under our court's governing law. As already discussed, this Order doesn't decide that issue. "
649,12," The Wellbutrin court did exclude another of Prof. Rosenthal's opinions under Daubert—but the excluded opinion is not relevant 
here. 308 F.R.D. at 146-47."
649,13," The court addresses the weight to give Prof. Rosenthal's opinion about the ascertainability of the putative class members in 
the Order on the class certification motion at Part IV.C.1. "
650,14," Defendants ask that, if the court declines to exclude Prof. Rosenthal's ascertainability opinion as unreliable under Rule 702 or 
improper rebuttal testimony, the court give defendants an opportunity to depose Prof. Rosenthal about the ascertainability 
opinion in her Reply Report, introduce additional expert rebuttal testimony, and submit supplemental briefing in opposition to 
plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification. The court denies this request. Prof. Rosenthal submitted her Reply Report on April 26, 
2019. Defendants had plenty of time to review and respond to this Reply Report before the court held its June 11-12, 2019 
hearing on the Motion for Class Certification. Also, Prof. Hughes has had the chance to review and comment on Prof. 
Rosenthal's Reply Report. See, e.g., Doc. 1850-1 (May 21, 2019 Decl. of Dr. James W. Hughes in Supp. of Defs.' Mot. to 
Exclude Expert Opinions of Professor Meredith Rosenthal). For all these reasons, the court denies defendants' request. "
651,15, The court addresses Prof. Rosenthal's probability opinions in its Order on the class certification motion at Part IV.E.2.b.ii. 
652,16, The court addresses Prof. Rosenthal's probability opinions in its Order on the class certification motion at Part IV.E.2.b.ii.
652,17," As previously mentioned, the court addresses Prof. Rosenthal's probability opinions in its Order on the class certification 
motion at Part IV.E.2.b.ii. "
654,18," Similar to the request above about Prof. Rosenthal's ascertainability opinion, defendants ask that, if the court declines to 
exclude Prof. Rosenthal's probability opinion, the court allow defendants to depose Prof. Rosenthal about the probability opinion 
in her Reply Report, introduce additional expert rebuttal testimony, and submit supplemental briefing opposing plaintiffs' Motion 
for Class Certification. The court denies this request for the same reasons discussed above. See supra note 14. Also, the court 
recognizes that Mylan's expert, Dr. Johnson, has had the chance to review and comment on Prof. Rosenthal's Reply Report. 
See, e.g., Doc. 1850-2 (May 21, 2019 Decl. of Dr. John H. Johnson, IV in Supp. of Defs.' Mot. to Exclude Expert Opinions of 
Professor Meredith Rosenthal)."
654,19," Prof. Elhauge also offers opinions about market definition and market power. Doc. 1500-2 at 1 (Elhauge Expert Report ¶ 1). 
Defendants don't challenge the admissibility of these opinions on class certification. But defendants reserve their right to 
challenge these opinions at a later stage. Doc. 1886 at 9 n.1. "
655,20," Defendants argue that Prof. Elhauge isn't just applying econometrics to antitrust issues here. Instead, they contend, he's 
""attempted"" to ""com[e] up with a new econometric method""—something he's not qualified to do. Doc. 1886 at 8. But defendants 
don't explain how Prof. Elhauge's analysis invokes an entirely new econometric method. Instead, as Prof. Elhauge testified, he 
applies proven econometric methods in his analysis to determine the effects of Mylan's exclusionary contracts with PBMs. Doc. 
1861-2 at 13 (Elhauge Dep. 31:5-8). "
657,21," The court addresses defendants' challenges to Professor Elhauge's opinion in its Order on the class certification motion at 
Parts IV.E.2.a. & IV.E.2.d. "
661,22," Defendants assert that Prof. Elhauge described ""some version"" of this analysis at his deposition but plaintiffs refused to 
produce the analysis when defendant requested it. Doc. 1854 at 21. Plaintiffs assert that defendants wrongly equate the ""rough 
estimate"" that Prof. Elhauge testified about at his deposition with the analysis he provided in his Reply Report. Doc. 1861 at 24. 
As discussed, Prof. Elhauge performed the analysis using Mylan rebate data produced after his deposition. So the court agrees 
with plaintiffs that the analysis described in his deposition differs from the analysis found in the Reply Report."
661,23," Defendants ask that, if the court declines to exclude Prof. Elhauge's testimony, the court give defendants an opportunity to 
depose Prof. Elhauge about the analysis in his Reply Report, introduce additional expert rebuttal testimony, and submit 
supplemental briefing in opposition to plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification. The court denies this request. As plaintiffs correctly 
explain, defendants had ample opportunity to review and respond to Prof. Elhauge's Report (issued on April 29, 2019) before the 
court held its June 11-12, 2019 hearing on the Motion for Class Certification. Also, this case is a long way from trial, and Mylan's 
expert has had the chance to review and comment on Prof. Elhauge's rebuttal opinions. See, e.g., Doc. 1605-7 (May 21, 2019 
Decl. of Dr. John H. Johnson, IV in Supp. of Defs.' Mot. to Exclude Expert Opinions of Professor Einer Elhauge). The court thus 
denies defendants' request. "
664,24," Defendants' motion never asserts directly that Prof. Torrance's opinions are inadmissible under Daubert because he isn't 
qualified to provide expert testimony. But, in a footnote, defendants suggest that Prof. Torrance doesn't have sufficient patent 
litigation experience ""that would qualify him to opine on the likely outcome of the underlying patent litigation."" Doc. 1848 at 8 
n.10. Plaintiffs respond that Prof. Torrance is well-qualified to provide expert testimony based on his experience as a patent 
attorney, his education, his extensive scholarship and publication in the patent field, and his teaching experience. Doc. 1862 at 
8-11. The court agrees. Prof. Torrance's experience and education qualify him to opine about Teva's likelihood of success in the 
Teva patent litigation. Defendants' criticisms about Prof. Torrance's experience in patent litigation trials, and the role he played in 
those trials, go to the weight of his opinions, not their admissibility. "
693,1," The JMPL also transferred a case filed by Sanofi-Aventis U.S. LLC (""Sanofi"") as part of this Multidistrict Litigation. It proceeds 
on a separate track, and this certification motion does not affect the claims or defenses in Sanofi's case. "
694,2," To determine whether plaintiffs have met their burden of affirmatively demonstrating compliance with Rule 23's requirements, 
the court ""must accept the substantive allegations of the complaint as true."" Shook v. El Paso Cty., 386 F.3d 963, 968 (10th Cir. 
2004) (citing J.B. ex rel. Hart v. Valdez, 186 F.3d 1280, 1290 n.7 (10th Cir. 1999)). "
695,3," The lone exception is France, where Mylan also sells the EpiPen in just one packaging format: the 2-Pak. "
696,4," The Class Complaint also describes patent litigation with Sandoz, but plaintiffs do not include any allegations about that 
litigation in their certification motion. "
697,5," In their brief, the Pfizer defendants join the arguments in the Mylan defendants' brief, but they also separately argue two other 
issues. So, arguments made by the Mylan defendants are also attributable to the Pfizer defendants. For ease, the court refers to 
arguments asserted by the Mylan defendants as ones asserted by Mylan. And it refers to arguments asserted separately by the 
Pfizer defendants as ones asserted by Pfizer. Also, this Order generally identifies which party made an argument or asserted a 
position. If neither defendant has addressed an issue that applies to both Mylan and Pfizer, the court notes that defendants have 
not addressed the issue. "
699,6," Class plaintiffs' original definition for classes 1, 2, and 5 contained the phrase ""Branded or AB-rated"" EpiPens instead of 
""Branded or authorized generic EpiPens."" An AB-rated device is one the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) rates as 
therapeutically equivalent to the brand device. U.S. FOOD & DRUG ADMIN., APPROVED DRUG PRODUCTS WITH 
THERAPEUTIC EQUIVALENCE EVALUATIONS xvi (2019), https://www.fda.gov/media/71474/download. An authorized generic

https://www.fda.gov/drugs/abbreviated-new-drug-application-anda/fda-list-authorized-generic-drugs (last updated Dec. 19,

available during the defined period is one manufactured by Teva Pharmaceuticals. Plaintiffs report they never intended 
purchasers of that product to qualify as members of any putative class. And, in their Reply, plaintiffs explain that ""reference in 
the class definitions to 'AB-rated generic EpiPens' should be changed to 'authorized generic EpiPens.'"" Doc. 1837 at 13 n.6. 
Consistent with plaintiffs' request, the court makes this change to the class definitions."
699,7," During the hearing on class certification, class plaintiffs' counsel suggested that ""until the effects of Defendants' unlawful 
conduct cease"" should refer to the date when class notice is given. Doc. 1789 at 133 (Tr. of Mot. Hr'g Class Certification — 
Phase II 133:17-18)."
699,8," Plaintiffs define the ""Antitrust States"" as: Alabama, Arizona, California, the District of Columbia, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, 
Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, 
North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. As discussed 
below, even if class certification is warranted under Rule 23, plaintiffs cannot assert class action claims under some of these 
state laws because no named plaintiff resides in the particular state. "
700,9," Plaintiffs define the ""Consumer Protection States"" as: Alaska, California, Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Florida, Hawaii, 
Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, 
Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and West Virginia. As discussed below, even if class certification is warranted 
under Rule 23, plaintiffs cannot assert class action claims under some of these state laws because no named plaintiff resides in 
the particular state."
700,10," Class plaintiffs assert all 50 states are ""Unjust Enrichment States."" If one of the other remedies eventually provides a remedy 
at law, class plaintiffs intend to exclude Arizona, Delaware, Louisiana, and North Dakota from this class."
700,6," Class plaintiffs' original definition for classes 1, 2, and 5 contained the phrase ""Branded or AB-rated"" EpiPens instead of 
""Branded or authorized generic EpiPens."" An AB-rated device is one the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) rates as

700,8," Plaintiffs define the ""Antitrust States"" as: Alabama, Arizona, California, the District of Columbia, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, 
Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, 
North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. As discussed 
below, even if class certification is warranted under Rule 23, plaintiffs cannot assert class action claims under some of these 
state laws because no named plaintiff resides in the particular state. "
701,9," Plaintiffs define the ""Consumer Protection States"" as: Alaska, California, Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Florida, Hawaii, 
Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, 
Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and West Virginia. As discussed below, even if class certification is warranted 
under Rule 23, plaintiffs cannot assert class action claims under some of these state laws because no named plaintiff resides in

701,10," Class plaintiffs assert all 50 states are ""Unjust Enrichment States."" If one of the other remedies eventually provides a remedy 
at law, class plaintiffs intend to exclude Arizona, Delaware, Louisiana, and North Dakota from this class."
701,11, The following exchange between the court and plaintiffs' counsel occurred at oral argument: 
702,," THE COURT: You lost me. Those—you're talking about now CVS and—what was the other one—Humana? They should 
be excluded? MR. BURNS: Their PBMs should be. THE COURT: They should be but third-party payors should not? MR. BURNS: Right. Third-party payors should not. Doc. 1789 at 28 (Tr. of Mot. Hr'g Class Certification — Phase II 28:11-18)."
702,12," March 13, 2014 is the date class plaintiffs refer to as the ""Generic Start Date,"" arrived at by their experts as the date when a 
generic device would have entered the EAI market but for defendants' allegedly anticompetitive behavior. Plaintiffs concede that 
subsequent discovery may shift this date forward in time, i.e. later than March 2014. "
703,13," The court recognizes that the Tenth Circuit has held that an ascertainability requirement does not apply to certification under 
Rule 23(b)(2). See Shook v. El Paso Cty., 386 F.3d 963, (10th Cir. 2004) (noting the Rule 23(b)(2) is ""well suited for cases 
where the composition of a class is not readily ascertainable (emphasis added)). But the court has found no case discussing 
whether an ascertainability requirement applies to Rule 23(b)(3) cases. "
704,," Quoting four words from In re Cox Enterprises, Inc. Set-top Cable Television Box Antitrust Litig., 790 F.3d 1112, 1118 (10th Cir. 
2015), Mylan suggests they demonstrate that the Tenth Circuit requires ascertainability. Doc. 1636 at 63. But the phrase 
""establishing an ascertainable class"" appears in a sentence where the court is criticizing plaintiffs for belatedly moving to compel 
arbitration until after the class was certified. Whether the class should have been certified, and whether it was sufficiently 
ascertainable, was not at issue in that case. So, the court doesn't view Cox Enterprises the same way Mylan does. "
705,14," But cf. Cline v. Sunoco, Inc. (R&M), 333 F.R.D. 676, 2019 WL 4879187, at *8-9 (E.D. Okla. Oct. 3, 2019) (recognizing Tenth 
Circuit does not consider ascertainability a separate Rule 23 factor but concluding that class definition must make class 
membership determination administratively feasible (citing Carrera, 727 F.3d at 306-07))."
705,15," The court recognizes that Prof. Hughes's Report focuses on the data produced in the case and concludes that ""[p]laintiffs have 
not provided a reliable methodology for identifying who is included or excluded from the class."" Doc. 1636-4 at 30-31 (Hughes 
Expert Report ¶ 63). As discussed above, the court rejects defendants' assertion that plaintiffs must satisfy this heightened 
standard of ascertainability at certification. But, even if the court applied this heightened standard, plaintiffs assert that they can 
identify such class members using pharmacy and medical records. Indeed, plaintiffs' expert, Prof. Meredith Rosenthal, has 
identified various data that, she says, will allow plaintiffs to ascertain who qualifies as a class member. This information includes 
data from PBMs, pharmacy records, and individuals' own records documenting EpiPen purchases. Doc. 1711-1 at 15-16, 28-29 
(Rosenthal Reply Report ¶¶ 20-21, 46-49). Other courts have noted that, in prescription medication cases, this kind of 
information makes it ""fairly easy to identify potential class members through pharmacy and medical records."" Krueger v. Wyeth, 
Inc., No. 03CV2496 JAH (AJB), 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 154478, 2011 WL 8984448, at *2-3 (S.D. Cal. July 13, 2011); see also In 
re Phenylpropanolamine (PPA) Prods. Liab. Litig., 214 F.R.D. 614, 619 (W.D. Wash. 2003) (contrasting cases ""involving . . . 
prescription medication verifiable by medical and pharmacy records"" from the current case involving over-the-counter medication 
where ""the process of simply identifying who rightfully belongs within the proposed class would entail a host of mini-trials""). 
Thus, even under a heightened ascertainability standard, plaintiffs have identified a viable method for identifying members of the 
classes. In reaching this conclusion, the court recognizes that defendants have challenged Prof. Rosenthal's ascertainability opinions 
with a Daubert motion. By separate Order, the court denies defendants' motion, concluding that Prof. Rosenthal's opinions are 
sufficiently reliable for the court to consider on class certification. As discussed in that Order, defendants question whether the 
data identified by Prof. Rosenthal is capable of identifying class members or even if it still exists. The court recognizes that 
merits discovery may establish that these records can't discharge the task Prof. Rosenthal assigns to them (specifically, 
identifying consumers who paid nothing for EpiPens, those who used a flat co-pay, or individuals who paid cash for their 
EpiPens). But, for now, and on the current record, Prof. Rosenthal supplies a reasonably reliable and plausible method for 
identifying putative class members sufficient to respond to Prof. Hughes's criticisms. "
706,16," The ""reside there"" requirement is likely imprecise. The court can imagine a named plaintiff who may have purchased EpiPens 
in a nearby state where the plaintiff doesn't reside. Such a named plaintiff could have standing to bring a state law claim under 
the laws of the place of purchase even though the plaintiff doesn't reside in that state. But plaintiffs never argue this nuance and 
nothing suggests the court needs to consider it here."
706,17," See 1 William B. Rubenstein, Newberg on Class Actions § 3:12 (5th ed. 2013) (suggesting that a class of 40 or more 
members should presumptively satisfy numerosity). "
708,18," Mylan makes these same arguments to assert that the named plaintiffs are inadequate class representatives. Thus, Mylan 
also contends that plaintiffs can't satisfy Rule 23(a)'s fourth requirement—adequacy. The court addresses the adequacy 
argument below, infra note 24. "
709,19," John Johnson, Ph.D. is an antitrust economist and statistician, retained by defendants, to evaluate the damage models 
prepared by plaintiffs' experts, Professors Rosenthal and Elhauge. Defendants did not ask Dr. Johnson to prepare an affirmative 
methodology for assessing impact or damages, and he did not offer such an assessment. See Doc. 1724 at 91-92 (Tr. of Mot. 
Hr'g Class Certification — Phase I 91:25-92:5 (""Q: Were you asked to offer any affirmative assessment of a classwide method 
for assessing impact or damages in this case? A: No. My assignment was not to put forward an affirmative methodology, it was 
to assess the work of Professor Rosenthal and Professor Elhauge.""). "
710,20," Although not highlighted in Mylan's brief, Dr. Hughes's Expert Report notes: ""Of the 50,216 group health plans of all types in 
the US in 2009, only 1,801, or less than 4 percent, are multiemployer, collectively bargained plans like Local 282."" Doc. 1636-4 
at 24 n.58 (Hughes Expert Report ¶ 47 n.58) (citing U.S. DEPT. OF LABOR, EMP. BENEFITS SEC. ADMIN., GROUP HEALTH 
PLANS REPORT: ABSTRACT OF 2009 FORM 550 ANNUAL REPORTS REFLECTING STATISTICAL YEAR FILINGS 6, tbl.A2 
(2012), 
https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/EBSA/researchers/statistics/retirement-bulletins/annual-report-on-self-insured-
group-health-plans-2012-appendix-a.pdf.). While multiemployer, collectively-bargained plans may represent a relatively small 
proportion of group plans, the raw number of plans similar to Local 282 is nonetheless a significant number of similar plans. "
711,21," Defendants have sought to exclude Prof. Rosenthal's opinions about injured class members by Daubert motion. By separate 
Order, the court denies defendants' motion, concluding the opinions are sufficiently reliable for the court to consider at class 
certification. The court concludes in this Order that Prof. Rosenthal's opinions support plaintiffs' assertion that each named class 
member sustained injury. The court recognizes that defendants' expert has criticized Prof. Rosenthal's assumptions and 
attacked her calculated generic penetration rate as flawed. But, the court finds that Prof. Rosenthal has shown she used a 
reasonable method to reach her opinions, and her opinions plausibly establish that each named class member sustained an 
injury."
711,22," Also, plaintiffs' expert, Prof. Elhauge, opines that brand loyalists sustained harm under the PBM foreclosure theory because 
""[t]he foreclosure of brand-brand competition between EpiPen and Auvi-Q would predictably have an additional adverse price 
effect not only on customers who would have continued to buy branded EpiPens but paid a lower price in the but-for world for it, 
but also on customers who would have bought a generic at a discount from what would have been a lower branded EpiPen 
price."" Doc. 1711-2 at 89-90 (Elhauge Reply Report ¶ 123). So, Prof. Elhauge opines, ""during the overlap period [i.e., months 
when there is an overlap between the foreclosure of Auvi-Q and the exclusion of the generic], all customers would suffer one 
harm or the other, whether or not they were brand loyalists."" Id. "
712,23," Because each named plaintiff has sustained injury under one of plaintiffs' theories, the named plaintiffs are typical 
representatives of the classes they seek to represent. To the extent named plaintiffs were injured by plaintiffs' other two theories 
(i.e., the 2-Pak and PBM foreclosure theories), those plaintiffs are typical of class members who also allegedly sustained injury 
under the other two theories. The court recognizes that if plaintiffs' generic delay theory fails on its merits, the court may have to 
revisit the typicality requirement to determine whether the named plaintiffs are typical of the classes they seek to represent."
712,24," As discussed above, supra note 18, Mylan also asserts that Local 282 is an inadequate class representative because it differs 
from other payors in the classes. Also, Mylan asserts that many named plaintiffs are inadequate class representatives because 
they are uninjured. The court rejected Mylan's arguments in the preceding section, finding that these arguments don't establish 
that the named plaintiffs are atypical of the classes they seek to represent. See supra Part IV.D.3. For the same reasons, the 
court concludes that defendants' arguments don't prevent the named plaintiffs from fairly and adequately representing the 
classes. "
713,25," Mylan also asserts that PBMs likely are class members, and that conflicts exist between plaintiffs and PBMs because plaintiffs 
allege the PBMs are RICO co-conspirators. As plaintiffs point out, however, no PBM can qualify as a class member under the 
class definitions. The proposed definition requires that the entity must have (a) paid or provided reimbursement for an EpiPen; 
(b) for the purpose of consumption, not resale; and (c) that purchase was intended for consumption by themselves, their family 
member(s), insureds, plan participants, employees, or beneficiaries. Also, the court has added an exclusion to the class 
definitions, excluding all third-party payors who own, operate, or control their own PBM. See supra Part IV.B. So, nothing 
suggests a PBM will qualify under the class definitions. Mylan certainly hasn't identified any PBMs who would qualify. "
716,26," Mylan asserts that Profs. Rosenthal and Elhauge's models contradict each other, and they criticize plaintiffs for not providing a 
method to determine which model applies to any particular plaintiff. Plaintiffs respond that Mylan's argument presents no 
problem on class certification. Instead, plaintiffs argue, Mylan's argument goes to the issue of damage allocation, and damage 
allocation will occur at a later stage of the proceeding, based on a jury's findings. Plaintiffs also explain, at that stage, the court 
can allocate the damage award based on a jury's findings in a way that prevents double recovery. The court agrees that Mylan's 
argument goes to damage allocation, not to the question whether plaintiffs can prove damages on a classwide basis."
716,27," Also, by separate motions, defendants ask the court to exclude Profs. Rosenthal and Elhauge's opinions under Daubert. By 
separate Order, the court denies those motions. "
717,28," The court recognizes that this case involves no competing expert methodologies for calculating damages. Defendants' expert, 
Dr. Johnson, explicitly states that his opinions, to date, advance no methodology for calculating damages. Doc. 1724 at 91-92 
(Tr. of Mot. Hr'g Class Certification — Phase I 91:25-92:5 (""Q: Were you asked to offer any affirmative assessment of a 
classwide method for assessing impact or damages in this case? A: No. My assignment was not to put forward an affirmative 
methodology, it was to assess the work of Professor Rosenthal and Professor Elhauge."")). And, even if the certification decision 
required the court to weigh opposing expert opinions, which it does not, see In re Lidoderm Antitrust Litig., 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
24097, 2017 WL 679367, at *18, that exercise would not apply to damage calculations. "
719,29," At oral argument on the certification motion, plaintiffs' counsel suggested that this exclusion isn't necessary if the court applies 
the collateral source doctrine to plaintiffs' claims. Doc. 1789 at 26 (Tr. of Mot. Hr'g Class Certification — Phase II 26:9-20). 
Regardless whether the collateral source doctrine applies to plaintiffs' claims, the court refuses to remove this exclusion from the 
proposed class definition. As defendants asserted at oral argument, plaintiffs included this proposed exclusion in their original 
motion. Defendants have litigated the certification motion on the understanding that plaintiffs' class definition excluded single, flat 
co-pay consumers. Id. at 94 (Tr. of Mot. Hr'g Class Certification — Phase II 94:4-95:11). And defendants' expert prepared his 
report based on his assumption that this exclusion was part of the class definitions. Thus, defendants argue, the court shouldn't 
permit plaintiffs to remove the exclusion at this late stage. The court agrees with defendants. The court will not expand the class definitions from the ones plaintiffs previously proposed. 
See In re Wholesale Grocery Prods. Antitrust Litig., No. 09-MD-2090 ADM/TNL, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 121006, 2016 WL 
4697338, at *5-6 (D. Minn. Sept. 7, 2016) (rejecting plaintiffs' revised class definition that included more putative plaintiffs on 
certification motion because ""[p]laintiffs [had] impermissibly expanded the class definition""); see also Costelo v. Chertoff, 258 
F.R.D. 600, 604-05 (C.D. Cal. 2009) (""The Court is bound to class definitions provided in the complaint and, absent an amended 
complaint, will not consider certification beyond it.""). And, the court finds no reason to remove the exclusion based on an 
assertion made by plaintiffs at oral argument. "
720,30," Plaintiffs propose this exclusion as an ""alternative to applying the collateral source rule."" Doc. 1579-1 at 7. Although the court 
doesn't decide whether to apply the collateral source rule now, it concludes that this exclusion is warranted because it removes 
from the class definitions individual consumers who could not have sustained injury because their only EpiPen purchases 
occurred before the Generic Start Date."
720,31," After oral argument, defendants submitted a letter to the court citing as supplemental authority the Rail Freight II opinion and 
another case from the District of Massachusetts. Doc. 1859 (first citing Rail Freight II, 934 F.3d 619; then citing  [*104] In re 
Intuniv Antitrust Litig., No. 1:16-cv-12396-ADB, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 141643, 2019 WL 3947262 (D. Mass. Aug. 21, 2019)). 
Plaintiffs responded to defendants' submission, arguing that the supplement authority doesn't apply to this case because it is "
721,," authority from outside the Tenth Circuit and factually different from the class certification record here. Doc. 1881. The court 
addresses these arguments more fully in the analysis below. "
723,32," Defendants filed an interlocutory Rule 23(f) Petition for Permission to Appeal Class Certification Order. The Tenth Circuit 
denied the request, noting that the decision to grant a Rule 23(f) petition is purely discretionary and finding that defendants had 
not established a reason warranting appellate review such as manifest error or an unresolved legal issue. Order, In re Syngenta 
AG MIR 162 Corn Litig., No. 16-607 (10th Cir. Dec. 7, 2016), ECF No. 01019731851. The Circuit also described Judge 
Lungstrum's certification decision as ""well-researched and reasoned, and if any rulings are error, those errors can be addressed 
on appeal, if necessary."" Id. at 3. "
724,33," On the other hand, the definition cannot narrow the class so much that it becomes an inappropriate fail-safe class, i.e., one 
where the court has to decide the merits of each prospective individual class members' claims to determine class membership, 
thereby defining the class in terms of the legal injury. See Messner, 669 F.3d at 825."
724,34," In Asacol, the district court found 10% a de minimis number of uninjured class members. 907 F.3d at 47. When reversing the 
district court's certification decision, the First Circuit did not specify the percentage of uninjured plaintiffs that are ""too many"" to 
permit certification. Though later cases cite Asacol to find that 10% is not de minimis, this finding—if indeed Asacol made it—is 
an implicit conclusion."
724,35," Our court also cited Urethane approvingly in another case. See Sibley v. Sprint Nextel Corp., 315 F.R.D. 642, 664 (D. Kan. 
2016) (""[G]iven that so many cases and treatises agree that the need for individualized damage determinations does not defeat 
commonality or predominance, it follows that the fact that some class members suffered no damages also does not defeat 
commonality or predominance."" (citing In re Urethane Antitrust Litig., 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 69784, 2013 WL 2097346, at *2 
(other citations omitted)))."
724,36," Two district courts have issued recent orders that sharply criticize Asacol and its effect on consumers' ability to bring class 
actions. See In re Loestrin 24 FE Antitrust Litig., 410 F. Supp. 3d 352, 404 (D.R.I. 2019) (denying motion to certify a class of 
end-payor plaintiffs (""EPP"") because Asacol left the court ""no room to rewrite what the First Circuit has clearly scripted"" but still 
the court was ""troubled that over ninety percent of consumers in the proposed EPP class may have been injured by Defendants' 
alleged unlawful conduct, but now have no practical recourse under antitrust law""); see also In re Intuniv Antitrust Litig., No. 
1:16-cv-12396-ADB, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 141643, 2019 WL 3947262, at *7 n.8, *8 (D. Mass. Aug. 21, 2019) (denying motion 
to certify class because ""In re Asacol dictates the outcome here"" but also recognizing ""In re Asacol is likely a death knell for 
pharmaceutical, antitrust class actions brought by indirect purchasers [because] [g]iven the myriad ways in which consumers 
could theoretically be uninjured, once a defendant asserts an intent to challenge each claim to have been affected by their 
conduct, it becomes nearly impossible for indirect purchasers to show that common issues will predominate under In re Asacol,"" 
so ""[a]bsent class certification, it is likely that most putative class members' claims will go unremedied,"" and ""assuming that 
Defendants engaged in anticompetitive conduct, although In re Asacol eliminates the possibility that some consumers might 
obtain a recovery for damages they did not suffer, it also ensures that a much larger number of Intuniv consumers will receive no 
remedy for harm [they] actually suffered""). "
725,37," Defendants assert that plaintiffs don't define the classes to include third-party payors who have covered five or more 
prescriptions. So, defendants contend, Prof. Rosenthal's conclusion shouldn't apply here. But, as plaintiffs argue, Prof. 
Rosenthal's probability analysis estimates that the likelihood that a third-party payor who covered just two prescriptions 
sustained injury is between 98.9% and 99.3%. Plaintiffs assert that these figures for just two purchases also demonstrate a very 
low probability that the putative classes include uninjured class members. Also, as plaintiffs have demonstrated, most third-party 
payor plans involve thousands of consumers. And, given the prevalence of anaphylaxis, it seems unlikely that a third-party payor 
would have covered just two, three, four, or even five EpiPen prescriptions during the class period."
725,38," Prof. Rosenthal recognizes that ""[c]onsumers with copayments that would not have varied for Auvi-Q vs. EpiPen would not 
have paid this overcharge directly."" Doc. 1711-1 at 33-34 (Rosenthal Reply Report ¶ 57). She estimates that such consumers 
represent between 41% and 71% of consumers, depending on a consumer's plan structure and EpiPen tier placement. Id. 
Plaintiffs assert that these consumers still sustained injury because the collateral source doctrine bars defendants from using 
insurance payments as an offset. As discussed above, the court need not decide whether the collateral source doctrine applies 
on class certification. But still, it presents another issue common to the classes. And, if the collateral source doctrine doesn't 
apply and excludes evidence of such plaintiffs, the presence of these consumers doesn't present individual questions that 
overwhelm the common questions because Prof. Rosenthal has provided a method for identifying these consumers. See supra 
Part IV.C.1 & n.15. Using that method, plaintiffs can remove those uninjured consumers from the classes, if a merits 
determination finds that these consumers sustained no injury."
725,39, See pages 37-45 of the court's Memorandum and Order ruling the Daubert motions. 
726,40," Briefly, in their Reply, plaintiffs assert that ""[a]ll individual class members were injured by the loss of choice in the market . . . ."" 
Doc. 1837 at 23. At oral argument, plaintiffs again asserted this argument and cited a Sixth Circuit case to support it. See Energy 
Conversion Devices Liquidation Tr. v. Trina Solar Ltd., 833 F.3d 680, 690 (6th Cir. 2016) (noting ""caselaw saying that a 
reduction in consumer choice can show anti-competitive harm"" (first citing Blue Shield of Va. v. McCready, 457 U.S. 465, 481-
84, 102 S. Ct. 2540, 73 L. Ed. 2d 149 (1982); then citing Conwood Co. v. U.S. Tobacco Co., 290 F.3d 768, 789-90 (6th Cir. 
2002)). The court recognizes some courts have applied such a rule in antitrust cases. See Ross v. Bank of Am., N.A., 524 F.3d "
727,217," , 226 (2d Cir. 2008) (holding that plaintiffs sufficiently alleged antitrust injuries in the form of reductions in ""consumer choice"" 
and the ""quality of [ ] services offered""); Laumann v. Nat'l Hockey League, 105 F. Supp. 3d 384, 397 (S.D.N.Y. 2015) 
(""[A]nticompetitive conduct is injurious if it limits consumer options.""). But the court doesn't address plaintiffs' argument here for 
two reasons. One, plaintiffs didn't develop this argument until the hearing on the certification motion. And two, the court finds that 
plaintiffs have shown plausibly that they can prove classwide injury using classwide evidence and the presence of uninjured 
class members doesn't defeat predominance."
727,41," At oral argument, Mylan's counsel provided an estimate of the number of uninjured class members using Prof. Rosenthal's 
analysis: ""If you have a class of 2 million plaintiffs, . . . if you even have just 5 percent of the class that is uninjured, you're talking 
about 100,000 people who will be getting damages under the plaintiffs' models that we know are not [ ]injured and that the 
plaintiffs have no way to identify without individualized inquiries and many trials."" Doc. 1789 at 73 (Tr. of Mot. Hr'g Class 
Certification — Phase II 73:13-20). "
730,42," Mylan launched the EpiPen 2-Pak on August 24, 2011. Plaintiffs use this date as the earliest date when the putative class 
sustained damages. "
731,43, Defendants don't argue that the other elements of plaintiffs' RICO claim involve individual issues that defeat predominance. 
732,44," Defendants have challenged the reliability of Prof. Rosenthal's event study in a Daubert motion. The court's Order deciding 
that motion explains that defendants' challenges to Prof. Rosenthal's opinions go to the weight of her opinions but they don't 
preclude admissibility. The court thus considers her event study when deciding plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification. And, the 
court finds, her opinions support class certification at this stage of the litigation. At this stage, plaintiffs don't need to establish that Prof. Rosenthal's opinions are indisputably correct. Instead, they merely must 
demonstrate that her opinions are capable of showing RICO causation on a classwide basis. The court finds they do. The 
persuasiveness of Prof. Rosenthal's opinions for proving classwide liability is a matter for the factfinder to consider at a later 
stage in the case. HN48[
] See In re Syngenta AG MIR 162 Litig., No. 14-md-2591-JWL, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 132549, 2016 WL 5371856, at *6 (D. Kan. Sept. 26, 2016) (explaining that ""'persuasiveness [of an expert's opinion showing classwide liability] "
733,," is, in general, a matter for the jury'"" (quoting Tyson Foods, Inc. v. Bouaphakeo, 136 S. Ct. 1036, 1049, 194 L. Ed. 2d 124 
(2016)))."
733,45," Defendants also argue that a RICO plaintiff must show that ""commission of the predicate acts"" caused plaintiff's injuries. 
Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., Inc., 473 U.S. 479, 496, 105 S. Ct. 3275, 87 L. Ed. 2d 346 (1985). Here, defendants contend 
plaintiffs can't show that any specific RICO predicate act caused plaintiffs' injuries as opposed to Mylan's decision to stop selling 
the EpiPen in single doses. Doc. 1636 at 72. This argument misses the mark. The predicate acts plaintiffs rely on to support their 
RICO claims are the false and misleading statements that defendants made about the medical justification for the switch to the 
2-Pak. See, e.g., Doc. 60 at 172 (Class Compl. ¶ 655.b.). Plaintiffs assert that they will show that defendants committed these 
predicate acts as part of a pattern of racketeering activity that included removing single doses of the EpiPen from the market and 
forcing consumers to buy the EpiPen in a 2-Pak. And, plaintiffs assert, they will show that defendants' conduct caused classwide 
injury because it forced consumers to buy more EpiPens. These allegations suffice to establish that plaintiffs will rely on 
classwide evidence to support their RICO theory that defendants' alleged commission of predicate acts caused plaintiffs' injuries. "
735,46," Defendants separately filed Daubert motions challenging the reliability of Profs. Torrance, Elhauge, and Rosenthal's opinions. 
The court's Order denying those motions explains that defendants' challenges go to the weight of expert opinions but don't 
preclude the court from ""admitting them,"" i.e., considering them when deciding the class certification motion. Thus, on the class 
certification motion, the court considers these expert opinions. And, the court concludes that they support class certification 
because they plausibly offer a classwide method for proving RICO liability. Defendants' challenges to the persuasiveness of these experts' opinions is a different matter. The factfinder can decide how 
persuasive these opinions are when deciding the merits of the case—i.e., whether the opinions prove that defendants entered 
unlawful reverse payment settlements that violated RICO. But for current purposes, the opinions present sufficient evidence of 
classwide causation to support plaintiffs' class certification motion. "
736,47," The court recognizes that ""deceitful concealment of material facts may constitute actual fraud"" sufficient to support a wire fraud 
claim. United States v. Cochran, 109 F.3d 660, 665 (10th Cir. 1997). ""[A] misleading omission is actionable as fraud . . . if it is 
intended to induce a false belief and resulting action to the advantage of the misleader and the disadvantage of the misled."" Id. 
(citation, internal quotation marks, and internal alternations omitted). "
737,48," For the same reasons discussed above, supra note 46, the court finds Prof. Elhauge's opinions sufficient to establish that 
plaintiffs will offer classwide evidence of causation to support their RICO claims."
737,49," The three cases are Kaiser Foundation Health Plan v. Pfizer, Inc., 712 F.3d 21 (1st Cir. 2013), Aetna, Inc. v. Pfizer, Inc., 712 
F.3d 51 (1st Cir. 2013), and Harden Manufacturing Co. v. Pfizer, Inc., 712 F.3d 60 (1st Cir. 2013). Harden was a class action of 
third-party payors; the other two cases were individual cases pursued by third-party payors. "
739,50," The court recognizes that, in Sergeants Benevolent, the Second Circuit held that plaintiffs failed their burden to show they 
could prove RICO causation with classwide evidence because their expert (Prof. Rosenthal) provided ""mere correlation 
evidence"" that didn't suffice to prove classwide causation. 806 F.3d at 96. But, the Second Circuit contrasted Prof. Rosenthal's 
analysis there with her analysis in Neurontin that involved an aggregate regression analysis. Id. The Second Circuit recognized: 
""Neurontin does indicate that where individual physicians' reliance on a pharmaceutical company's misrepresentations forms a 
necessary link in the causal chain between those misrepresentations and the plaintiffs' injury, such reliance can be proved to a 
jury with sufficiently powerful aggregate evidence, as opposed to individualized inquiries as to each prescribing physician's 
actual decisionmaking."" Id. at 97. Nevertheless, the Second Circuit concluded, it ""need not (and do[es] not intend to) express 
any view here on whether or when an aggregate regression analysis similar to the one deployed in Neurontin might be sufficient 
to prove causation on a class-wide basis in other pharmaceutical-marketing cases alleging a pattern of mail fraud actionable 
under RICO"" because plaintiffs' causation evidence there was too ""simplistic"" to support classwide evidence of causation. Id. In 
contrast, as discussed above, plaintiffs here have offered classwide evidence of causation through Prof. Elhauge's regression "
740,," model. And, as the court concludes above, this showing suffices to establish that common issues predominate the RICO 
causation analysis. "
741,51," Also, Prof. Elhauge provided a separate damage calculation for plaintiffs' other theory—exclusive dealing through defendants' 
use of exclusionary PBM contract. See Doc. 1500-2 at 56-66 (Elhauge Expert Report ¶¶ 110-120); see also Doc. 1497-2 at 56-
66 (Elhauge Expert Report ¶¶ 110-120) (sealed version)."
741,52," The 27 states are: Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, 
Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, 
South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. And, as noted above, plaintiffs also ask the court to 
certify a class under the laws of the District of Columbia. But the court already has dismissed the state law antitrust claims brought under the laws of Arizona, the District of Columbia, 
Iowa, New Mexico, North and South Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wisconsin because the Class 
Complaint includes no named plaintiff residing in any of these states. See Doc. 896 at 127; Doc. 1292 at 3. So, the court cannot 
certify a class action asserting antitrust violations under the laws of these states. That leaves 17 states subject to this portion of 
the certification motion. "
742,53," Plaintiffs' opening brief acknowledges they must use common evidence to show that defendants inflicted antitrust impact, or 
injury, on the class. Doc. 1500 at 73-74. HN56[
] The antitrust injury requirement ""'ensures that a plaintiff can recover only if 
the loss stems from a competition-reducing aspect or effect of the defendant's behavior.'"" Elliott Indus. Ltd. P'ship v. BP Am. 
Prod. Co., 407 F.3d 1091, 1124-25 (10th Cir. 2005) (quoting Atl. Richfield Co. v. USA Petroleum Co., 495 U.S. 328, 344, 110 S. 
Ct. 1884, 109 L. Ed. 2d 333 (1990)). At the certification stage, plaintiffs do not have to prove impact; instead, they need ""only to 
demonstrate that the element of antitrust impact is capable of proof at trial through evidence that is common to the class rather 
than individual to its members."" Messner v. Northshore Univ. Healthsystem, 669 F.3d 802, 818 (7th Cir. 2012) (citation and 
internal quotation marks omitted). As discussed above, plaintiffs have provided a common methodology for calculating 
aggregate damages stemming from defendants' alleged antitrust violations through Profs. Elhauge and Rosenthal's expert 
opinions, and these calculations apply classwide for each of plaintiffs' antitrust theories. See supra Part IV.E.2.b. The court finds 
that this showing suffices to establish that plaintiffs are capable of presenting common evidence of antitrust impact."
742,54," Defendants haven't asserted a Daubert challenge to Prof. Elhauge's opinions about market definition and market power. But 
defendants assert that they are reserving their right to challenge these opinions at a later stage. Doc. 1886 at 9 n.1. "
743,55," The IQVIA Xponent data consists of pharmacy records that plaintiffs produced. Doc. 1711-1 at 29 (Rosenthal Reply Report ¶ 
48)."
743,56," As Prof. Rosenthal explained, the WAC price is the wholesale acquisition cost. Doc. 1724 at 15 (Tr. of Mot. Hr'g Class 
Certification — Phase I 15:12-22). It is the list price set by the manufacturer. Id. Once a manufacturer has determined a drug's 
WAC price, that price is typically used in transactions between the manufacturer and wholesaler. Id. It is essentially the 
benchmark the wholesaler uses for many of its sales to pharmacies. Id. "
744,57," Plaintiffs don't respond specifically to Pfizer's arguments about the merits of the patent claims. Defendants criticize Prof. 
Elhauge's reliance on Prof. Torrance's opinion that Teva had more than a 70% chance of prevailing in the patent litigation. 
Defendants levied the same attacks against Prof. Torrance's opinion in the Daubert motion. As the court discussed in its Order 
denying that motion, defendants' arguments go to the weight of Prof. Torrance's opinions but don't preclude their admissibility. "
745,," And, here, on certification, the court need not weigh whether Prof. Torrance accurately opines about Teva's chances of success 
in the patent litigation. Instead, the court must determine whether Prof. Elhauge's opinions, relying on Prof. Torrance's opinions, 
provide a plausible method for proving plaintiffs' generic delay theory on a classwide basis. The court finds that they do. "
746,58," The 20 states are: Alaska, California, Connecticut, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Missouri, 
Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and West 
Virginia. Doc. 1500 at 86, 88. And, as noted, plaintiffs also seek certification under the laws of the District of Columbia. The court notes that the Consolidated Class Action Complaint doesn't plead a violation of the state consumer protection laws in 
Alaska, the District of Columbia, or Rhode Island. See Doc. 60 at 182-394. It only alleges violation of those three jurisdictions' 
antitrust laws. See id. at 145-47, 149-50, 152-54, 157-59. But the court has dismissed those three state law antitrust claims 
because the Class Complaint includes no named plaintiff residing in any of the three. See Doc. 896 at 127 (dismissing ""the class 
plaintiffs' state law antitrust claims asserted against both sets of defendants under the laws of Alaska, . . . the District of 
Columbia, [and] Rhode Island . . . because the Class Complaint includes no named plaintiff who resides in any of these states""). 
Also, the court has dismissed the state consumer protection law claims brought under the laws of New Mexico, Vermont, 
Washington, and West Virginia because the Class Complaint includes no named plaintiff residing in those states. Doc. 896 at 
127, Doc. 1292 at 3."
746,59," Defendants also make three other arguments. They contend that the state consumer protection statutes at issue here award 
different types of damages, use varying rules for eligibility to sue, and impose differing statutes of limitations. And, defendants 
argue, these differences in state laws present individual issues that overwhelm the common questions. Because the court 
agrees with defendants' argument that differences in how the state laws define unfair conduct prevent certification, the court 
does not need to reach defendants' other arguments against certification."
746,60," Plaintiffs don't identify the other mechanisms the court could employ. But, they cite In re Syngenta AG MIR 162 Corn Litig., No. 
14-md-2591-JWL, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 132549, 2016 WL 5371856 (D. Kan. Sept. 26, 2016), where our court certified eight, 
separate statewide class actions. 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 132549, [WL] at *12-15 (certifying separate statewide classes 
consisting of corn producers in Arkansas, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, and South Dakota). But this 
comparison isn't an apt one. Here, plaintiffs don't ask the court to certify separate statewide classes. Instead, they ask the court 
to certify one ""Consumer Protection Damages Class"" consisting of all persons and entities in the ""Consumer Protection States"" 
who purchased or paid for EpiPens. Doc. 1353 at 3."

policies of the Federal Trade Commission and interpretations given by the Federal Trade Commission and the federal courts to 
Section 5(a)(1) of the Federal Trade Commission Act . . . ."" W.Va. Code § 46A-6-101(1). Section 45(a)(1) of Title 15 to the 
United States Code declares unlawful ""[u]nfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce"" and ""unfair or deceptive acts or 
practices in or affecting commerce."" Section 45(n) prohibits the FTC from declaring an act unlawful on the ground that it is 
""unfair unless the act or practice causes or is likely to cause substantial injury to consumers which is not reasonably avoidable 
by consumers themselves and not outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or to competition."" The court predicts 
that West Virginia would apply this test when determining whether an act is an unfair act prohibited by the West Virginia 
Consumer Credit and Protection Act."
747,63," Nebraska requires the plaintiff asserting a Nebraska Consumer Protection Act claim to ""prove that the practice either '(1) fell 
within some common-law, statutory, or other established concept of unfairness or (2) was immoral, unethical, oppressive, or 
unscrupulous.'"" State ex rel. Stenberg v. Consumer's Choice Foods, Inc., 276 Neb. 481, 755 N.W. 2d 583, 591 (Neb. 2008)

has not defined unfair practices under the state consumer protection act but recognizing that the Nebraska federal court defined 
the term in Raad). New Hampshire applies ""the rascality test"" to determine whether an act is an unfair or deceptive act 
prohibited by the New Hampshire Consumer Protection Act. Axenics, Inc. v. Turner Constr. Co., 164 N.H. 659, 675-76, 62 A.3d

eyebrow of someone inured to the rough and tumble of the world of commerce."" Id. (citation and internal quotation marks 
omitted). New Mexico's Unfair Trade Practices Act specifically defines the conduct prohibited by the statute. See N.M. Stat. 
Ann. § 57-12-2(E) (defining an ""unconscionable trade practice"" as ""an act or practice . . . that to a person's detriment: (1) takes 
advantage of the lack of knowledge, ability, experience or capacity of a person to a grossly unfair degree; or (2) results in a 
gross disparity between the value received by a person and the price paid""). And New Mexico courts apply the statute's 
definition when determining whether conduct violates the statute. See, e.g., State ex rel. King v. B & B Inv. Grp., Inc., 2014- 
NMSC 024, 329 P.3d 658, 665 (N.M. 2014) (applying N.M. Stat. Ann. § 57-12-2(E)'s definition of ""unconscionable trade

747,64," The Nevada Deceptive Trade Practices Act allows ""any person who is a victim of consumer fraud"" to bring an action under the

597.0925. Nev. Rev. Stat. § 41.600(2)(e). The Nevada federal district court has interpreted the statute's plain language to

N.A., 691 F.3d 1152, 1169 (9th Cir. 2012) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The Ninth Circuit has cited two tests 
that the California courts have used to determine whether alleged conduct violates the UCL. Id. at 1169-70. "

proof of some actual or threatened impact on competition.'"" Id. at 1700 (quoting Cel-Tech Commc'ns, Inc. v. L.A. Cellular Tel. 
Co., 20 Cal. 4th 163, 83 Cal. Rptr. 2d 548, 973 P.2d 527, 544 (Cal. 1999)). In Davis, the Ninth Circuit did not decide which of the 
two tests defines unfair conduct under the UCL because, it determined, plaintiff had failed ""to state a claim under either 
definition."" Id. The Ninth Circuit and California federal courts have followed Davis's guidance and have applied both tests when 
determining whether alleged conduct qualifies as ""unfair"" conduct prohibited by the UCL. See, e.g., Hodsdon v. Mars, Inc., 891

751,70," The Supreme Court has explained that ""Rule 23(b)(2) applies only when a single injunction or declaratory judgment would 
provide relief to each member of the class."" Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 360, 131 S. Ct. 2541, 180 L. Ed. 2d 
374 (2011). But Rule 23(b)(2) ""does not authorize class certification when each individual class member would be entitled to a 
different injunction or declaratory judgment against the defendant,"" or ""when each class member would be entitled to an 
individualized award of monetary damages."" Id. at 360-61. After Dukes, a ""sort of hybrid certification"" has ""gain[ed] ground in class actions suits."" Ebert v. Gen. Mills, Inc., 823 F.3d 472, 
480 (8th Cir. 2016) (citing 2 William B. Rubenstein, Newberg on Class Actions § 4:38 (5th ed. 2019)); see also West v. Cal. 
Servs. Bureau, Inc., 323 F.R.D. 295, 307 (N.D. Cal. 2017) (""District courts may certify both a 23(b)(2) class for the portion of the 
case concerning injunctive and declaratory relief and a 23(b)(3) class for the portion of the case requesting monetary damages."" 
(citing Newberg on Class Actions § 4:38)). Plaintiffs don't refer to this aspect of their certification motion as a request for a 
""hybrid"" or ""dual"" class action under both Rule 23(b)(2) and 23(b)(3). But the court assumes that's what plaintiffs intended to do 
because they ask the court to certify several different classes under either Rule 23(b)(2) or 23(b)(3). "
752,71," As described above, supra Part IV.A. & n.7, plaintiffs' original certification motion proposed that the class period would run 
""until the effects of Defendants' unlawful conduct cease."" See, e.g., Doc. 1353 at 2-3. At oral argument, plaintiffs proposed to 
change this part of the class definitions to define the class period as ending on the date when class notice is given. The court 
adopts that change in the certified class definitions."
752,72," As discussed above, supra note 52, the court cannot certify a class asserting antitrust violations under the laws of states 
where no plaintiff resides. So, the court redefines the ""Antitrust States"" from the definition proposed by plaintiffs to remove those 
states that have no named plaintiff. The court thus defines the ""Antitrust States"" to include: Alabama, California, Florida, Hawaii, 
Illinois, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, 
Tennessee, and Utah. "
753,73," The court also appointed Eric Hochstradt, counsel for Sanofi, as co-lead counsel. "
755,1," In his original Complaint, Plaintiff named a number of other defendants, including Maria Torres-Springer (""Torres-Springer""), in 
her official capacity as the Commissioner of the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development. (See Dkt. 
2.) By Order dated November 13, 2018, the Court dismissed Plaintiffs claims against Torres-Springer and certain of the other 
originally named defendants and directed that the City of New York (the ""City"") be substituted as a defendant for the City 
agency. (See Dkt. 13.) The Court also directed Rose Associates, which it understood to have been the employer of certain 
security guards listed by Plaintiff as ""Doe"" defendants, to identify those security guards, so that their full names could be 
included in the caption. (See id.) Neither Plaintiff's claims against the City, nor his potential claims against the security guards, 
are directly implicated in the motion to dismiss that is currently pending before the Court. "
756,2," Consistent with its obligation to construe pro se pleadings liberally (see Discussion, infra, at Section I(B)), this Court will 
consider as true, for purposes of the pending motion to dismiss, the factual allegations contained in submissions that Plaintiff 
apparently intended to augment or clarify his Complaint."
756,3," After Defendants submitted a purportedly true and correct copy of this letter in support of their motion to dismiss (see 
Declaration of Yamile Zarzuela in Support of Rose Associates Defendants' Motion To Dismiss Plaintiff's Complaint, dated Mar. 
6, 2019 (""Zarzuela Decl."") ¶ 7 and Ex. B thereto), Plaintiff submitted a different version of the same letter (Pl. Mem., at the page 
numbered ""15"" by the Court's Electronic Case Filing (""ECF"") system (i.e., ""ECF 15"")), and argued that Defendants' submitted 
version was ""false and forged"" (id., at 2). The distinction between the two versions of this letter is that the one submitted by 
Defendants refers to Plaintiff only as Orr's ""guest,"" while the one submitted by Plaintiff refers to him by name. (Compare 
Zarzuela Decl, Ex. B., with Pl. Mem., at ECF 15.) "
757,4," On the same day that he filed his Complaint, Plaintiff also filed a ""Motion for Emergency Preliminary Monetary Substitution 
Injunction,"" seeking payment of $45,000, purportedly to finance this litigation. (Dkts. 3-4, 7-8.) That motion was denied by the 
Court on November 20, 2018. (See Dkt. 15.) "
763,5," In this regard, the Court also notes that Defendants characterize the Decision and Order of the Housing Court as containing a 
finding that Plaintiff was not a tenant. (Def. Mem., at 5, 9.) The actual language of the Decision and Order, however, is not so 
clear. (Housing Court Order (finding that ""the landlord had nothing to do w[ith] either the letting or the alleged lockout"").) "
766,6," The Court notes that while Defendants assert that Plaintiff's purported lack of status as a lawful tenant is fatal to all of his 
numerous constitutional claims, Defendants only substantively address Plaintiff's due-process claim related to the alleged 
lockout. "
773,1," The procedural background of the underlying disciplinary proceeding is summarized from the Tennessee Supreme Court's 
October 11, 2019 Order Reinstating Temporary Suspension. In re Brian Phillip Manookian, BPR #026455, No. M2019-00630-
SC-BAR-BP (Tenn. Oct. 11, 2019) (recounting procedural history) and from the Order Denying Petition for Dissolution of Order 
of Temporary Suspension, In re Brian Phillip Manookian, BPR #026455, No. M2019-00630-SC-BAR-BP (Tenn. Oct. 17, 2019). 
The details of the complaints in the disciplinary proceeding are not relevant to the Court's opinion. "
774,2," Defendants' Motion to Dismiss is filed pursuant to both Rule 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6). The Court did not reach the sovereign 
immunity defense and accordingly decided the Motion under the standard prescribed by Rule 12(b)(6)."
774,3," Defendants also raise the Rooker-Feldman Doctrine as a bar to review of state court decisions ""[t]o the extent the state 
disciplinary proceedings have been concluded."" As the state disciplinary proceedings have not concluded and the Court finds 
Plaintiff's claims are otherwise barred, the Court does not reach the Rooker-Feldman issue. "

775,5," The Rules do not even appear to confer this much authority on the members of the BPR. The Rules provide that a petition for 
temporary suspension may be made by Disciplinary Counsel, who reports to the BPR. Tenn. Ct. App. R. 9, §§ 7.1, 12.3. The 
Board or a panel conducts hearings on a petition for dissolution of temporary suspension and files a report and recommendation 
with the Tennessee Supreme Court. Id. at § 12.3(d). "
776,6," Plaintiff only seeks damages against Defendants in their individual capacities for the Section 1983 claims. However, to the 
extent damages are sought against Defendants in their official capacities, such claims are barred by the Eleventh Amendment. 
See Moncier v. Jones, 557 F. App'x 407, 409 (6th Cir. 2014) (""[T]he Eleventh Amendment bars official-capacity claims for

791,1," Before a drug manufacturer can sell a drug on the market, it must get approval from the Food and Drug Administration (""FDA""). 
It does so by submitting a new drug application. See FTC v. Actavis, Inc., 570 U.S. 136, 142, 133 S. Ct. 2223, 186 L. Ed. 2d 343 
(2013)."
791,2," Plaintiffs have formally sued multiple Gilead entities: Gilead Sciences, Inc.; Gilead Holdings, LLC; Gilead Sciences, LLC; and 
Gilead Sciences Ireland UC."
791,3," Plaintiffs have formally sued multiple BMS entities: Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and E.R. Squibb & Sons, L.L.C."
791,4, Plaintiffs have formally sued multiple Janssen entities: Johnson & Johnson and Janssen R&D Ireland. 
793,5," For example, if the first filer does not get tentative approval of the generic drug within 30 months, the ANDA Exclusivity is 
forfeited. See CAC ¶ 78. The first filer also forfeits if ""it fails to market its generic drug within 75 days after another manufacturer 
obtains a final decision that the brand manufacturer's patents are invalid or not infringed."" CAC ¶ 78. "
794,6," The rough timeline is as follows: • December 2004: Gilead entered into an agreement with BMS (the Atripla Agreement). • March 2005: Gilead entered into an agreement with Japan Tobacco. • July 2009: Gilead entered into an agreement with Janssen (the Complera Agreement). • June 2011: Gilead entered into another agreement with Janssen (the Prezcobix Agreement). This agreement allegedly 
protected one of Janssen's vulnerable drugs, not Gilead's. "
795,," • October 2011: Gilead entered into a second agreement with BMS (the Evotaz Agreement). This agreement allegedly 
protected one of BMS's vulnerable drugs, not Gilead's. • December 2014: Gilead entered into more agreements with [**18]  Janssen (the Odefsey Agreement and the Symtuza 
Agreements). The Symtuza Agreement allegedly protected one of Janssen's vulnerable drug, not Gilead's."
795,7," And Defendants point out that the federal government has applauded some of the business collaborations. See Gilead Mot. at 
9 (citing to comments made by the Secretary of Health & Human Services with respect to business collaboration between Gilead 
and BMS on a FDC commercially known as Atripla)."
795,8," Plaintiffs suggest that Gilead was able to do this through use of ""large sales forces that visit doctors' offices and persuade them 
to prescribe"" certain products. See CAC ¶ 368."
795,9," Plaintiffs also allege that ""doctors typically are not aware of the relative costs of brand pharmaceuticals and, even when they 
are aware of costs, are largely insensitive to price differences because they do not pay for the products."" CAC ¶ 368. "
797,10," According to Plaintiffs, theoretically, doctors could prescribe TAF for an off-label use — i.e., to treat HIV. ""But, in fact, 
substantial numbers of doctors will not do so. And federal law (21 C.F.R. § 202.1) makes it unlawful for a pharmaceutical 
manufacturer to actively encourage doctors to prescribe the product for off-label use."" CAC ¶ 307. "
799,11," Notably, Plaintiffs do not allege that a non-Gilead defendant got any benefit out of the agreements that Gilead had with the 
other non-Gilead defendants. It is not obvious why knowledge of a conspiracy should be inferred under these circumstances 
absent specific supporting facts. "
800,12," Although the Court shall hereinafter refer to ""joint ventures"" only, it notes that it is not limiting its discussion to joint ventures 
alone — i.e., the ancillary restraints doctrine also has application to other business forms or structures such as business 
collaborations. See Texaco Inc. v. Dagher, 547 U.S. 1, 7, 126 S. Ct. 1276, 164 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2006) (noting that the ancillary 
restraints doctrine ""governs the validity of restrictions imposed by a legitimate business collaboration, such as a business 
association or joint venture, on nonventure activities"")."
800,13," HN4[
] Cases often address joint ventures in the context of § 1 of the Sherman Act since § 1 covers agreements to restrain trade. There is no reason not to apply a similar analysis to § 2 claims for conspiracy to monopolize as such claims require a 
showing of anticompetitive conduct. Furthermore, the parties have not made any argument that the § 1 and § 2 conspiracy 
claims should be treated differently in this regard. "
801,14," Lower courts have varied somewhat as to how they define ""ancillary restraint."" See, e.g., In re Ins. Brokerage Antitrust Litig., 
618 F.3d 300, 345-46 (3d Cir. 2010) (""Ancillary restraints are 'those that are part of a larger endeavor whose success they 
promote.'""); Schering-Plough Corp. v. FTC, 402 F.3d 1056, 1072 (11th Cir. 2005) (""Ancillary restraints are generally permitted if 
they are 'reasonably necessary' toward the contract's objective of utility and efficiency.""); Sullivan v. NFL, 34 F.3d 1091, 1102 
(1st Cir. 1994) (""[A] 'restraint' that is ancillary to the functioning of . . . a joint activity [is] one that is required to make the joint 
activity more efficient . . . .""); Rothery Storage & Van Co. v. Atlas Van Lines, Inc., 792 F.2d 210, 224, 253 U.S. App. D.C. 142 
(D.C. Cir. 1986) (""To be ancillary, . . . an agreement eliminating competition must be subordinate and collateral to a separate,

transaction more effective in accomplishing its purpose.""); Polk Bros., Inc. v. Forest City Enters., Inc., 776 F.2d 185, 188-89 (7th

which restrain competition may be valid if they are 'subordinate and collateral to another legitimate transaction and necessary to 
make that transaction effective.'""); see also Major League Baseball Props., Inc. v. Salvino, 542 F.3d 290, 339 (2d Cir. 2008) 
(Sotomayor, J., concurring) (""The [ancillary restraints] doctrine recognizes that a restraint that is unnecessary to achieve a joint 
venture's efficiency-enhancing benefits may not be justified based on those benefits. Accordingly, a challenged restraint must 
have a reasonable procompetitive justification, related to the efficiency-enhancing purposes of the joint venture, before that 
restraint will be analyzed as part of the venture.""). The Supreme Court has noted that ""[t]he classic 'ancillary' restraint is an agreement by the seller of a business not to compete 
within the market."" Bus. Elecs. Corp. v. Sharp Elecs. Corp., 485 U.S. 717, 729 n.3, 08 S. Ct. 1515, 99 L. Ed. 2d 808 (1988). "

its only active pharmaceutical ingredients, TDF and FTC."" Ostrander Decl., Ex. A (Atripla Agreement § 1.77). "
805,16," As alleged by Plaintiffs, BMS expected generic competition for ATV as early as 2012, if generic manufacturers were 
successful in challenging the patents protecting the drug. See CAC ¶ 132. This date was earlier than the date that Gilead's 
patents protecting COBI would expire (i.e., 2029). See CAC ¶ 133."
805,17," ""'Combination Product' shall mean a fixed-dose co-formulated product in oral dosage form containing, as its only APIs, [ATV]

Combination Product that is approved for marketing in the Field under an [ANDA] . . . ."" Ex. C (Evotaz Agreement § 1.90)."
805,18," The Evotaz Agreement also contains a similar No-Generics Restraint that restricts BMS: ""During the Term, without the prior 
written consent of Gilead (i) BMS shall not . . . make, use, sell, [etc.] . . . in the Field in the Territory, the Combination Product 
(including any Generic Combination Product)."" Ostrander Decl., Ex. C (Evotaz Agreement § 14.3(a)). However, for purposes of 
the instant case, the relevant No-Generics Restraint is § 14.2(a) given Plaintiffs' theory that the Evotaz Agreement was designed 
to protect BMS's vulnerable drug. "
806,19," Indeed, as noted above, Defendants have taken the position that what constitutes patent misuse under patent law does not 
establish what is per se illegal under antitrust law. "
807,20," See also In re Actos End Payor Antitrust Litig., No. 13-CV-9244 (RA), 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 127748, at *15 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 
22, 2015) (noting that an authorized generic is one sold by the brand or through a licensed third-party generic manufacturer). "
808,21," This is not to say that every exclusive license may be subject to antitrust scrutiny. In many cases, such as where a 
manufacturer grants an exclusive license to one distributor, the licensor does not ordinarily compete with the licensee. The 
license in that context facilitates competition. In contrast, here, the licensor would ordinarily compete in the same market as the 
licensee but agrees as part of the license to withdraw from competition; thus, arguably there is at least an cognizable restraint of 
trade. Such a restraint may nonetheless be lawful under, e.g., rule of reason, but it is not automatically immune from scrutiny."
808,22," Although Gilead's COBI patents have a longer maximum patent life — until 2029 — Plaintiffs indicate that the inclusion of 
COBI in Stribild and Genvoya was not that significant because Japan Tobacco could have used an available substitute for COBI 
(i.e., RTV or generic RTV) in a competing FDC. See, e.g., CAC ¶ 112 (noting that generic RTV became available in March 
2018)."

to address them. "

811,25," As noted above, Plaintiffs suggest that Gilead was able to do this through use of ""large sales forces that visit doctors' offices 
and persuade them to prescribe"" certain products. See CAC ¶ 368."
811,26," In its motion, BMS argues that ""having to take two pills a day instead of one is not the type of interest protected by the antitrust 
laws, which concern quantifiable economic injury."" BMS Mot. at 12 (emphasis in original). But Plaintiffs are claiming an economic 
injury — the inability to purchase a competing FDC made up (at least in part) of generics. The reason why Plaintiffs want to buy 
the competing FDC (e.g., for convenience) should not mean there is not an economic injury. "
812,27," As noted above, the Actavis Court ultimately held that a reverse payment settlement agreement could be anticompetitive in 
nature, even if the alleged infringer simply made the promise not to enter the patentee's market before the patent term ended. 
See Actavis, 570 U.S. at 141. "
813,," The Court notes that, although there appears to have been a MFE in Actavis, the MFE was not substantively discussed in the 
opinion. See id. at 145 (noting that ""Actavis [the generic manufacturer] agreed that it would not bring its generic to market until 
August 31, 65 months [more than 5 years] before Solvay's patent expired (unless someone else marketed a generic sooner)"")."
813,28," As noted above, a ""first-filing generic manufacturer is guaranteed [the ANDA] exclusivity period [of 180 days] even if it settles 
litigation with a patent owner without resolving the invalidity or noninfringement issues"" — which serves as a disincentive for a "
814,," second filer to press a patent challenge — AIDS Healthcare, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87578, at *4-5, but resurrection of ANDA 
Exclusivity is a different matter."
814,29," Gilead suggests that the antitrust claims are predicated on Plaintiffs' position that the patents protecting TDF, FTC, and/or 
TDF/FTC are weak, but there are no factual allegations to explain why the patents are weak. See Gilead Mot. at 30-31. While 
this argument is not without some merit, it is reasonable to infer that there were problems with the patents as Teva and the 
multiple other generic manufacturers levied patent challenges. This is not a matter that can be determined as a matter of law at 
this juncture. "
816,30," As indicated above, if the Court were to find per se illegality under § 1, then Plaintiffs would not need to worry about market 
definition. But at this juncture of the proceedings, the Court has not made any conclusion as to whether the per se illegal rule 
applies. "
817,31," For instance, which cART drugs are included and which are not? Is that market limited to those which contain a Gilead product 
or does it extend to all cART drugs? "
818,32," To be sure, it may be argued that Gilead is asserting choice of law dressed up as a due process claim. But as noted herein, 
case law has established a distinct due process analytical framework. "
819,33," Gilead also discusses Massachusetts law but based on a consumer protection statute, not antitrust law."
819,34," HN19[
] There is no dispute that, under federal antitrust law, indirect purchasers are not entitled to damages. See generally Ill. Brick Co. v. Ill., 431 U.S. 720, 97 S. Ct. 2061, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1977). "
831,35," Regarding a claim of deception based on concealment or suppression, an Illinois state court has noted that ""sellers have a 
duty not to conceal or suppress known material facts regarding products from potential buyers"" and that, for liability to attach, ""a 
plaintiff must establish that defendants intended that [the consumers] rely on the suppression in making their choice to buy."" 
Jensen v. Bayer AG, 371 Ill. App. 3d 682, 689, 862 N.E.2d 1091, 308 Ill. Dec. 888 (2007). "

the Tennessee statute directs a court to look to federal interpretation of the FTC Act for guidance but nevertheless ""follow[ing] 
the narrower interpretation of the Tennessee courts"" — i.e., ""deception is required for a TCPA claim""). "
833,37," Regarding a claim of deception based on concealment or suppression, a West Virginia state court has noted as follows: 
""Where concealment, suppression or omission is alleged, and proving reliance is an impossibility, the causal connection 
between the deceptive act and the ascertainable loss is established by presentation of facts showing that the deceptive conduct 
was the proximate cause of the loss."" White v. Wyeth, 227 W. Va. 131, 140, 705 S.E.2d 828 (2010). "

purpose of, e.g., creating or carrying out restrictions in trade or commerce); N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law § 340(1) (declaring as illegal 
and void contracts, agreements, arrangements, or combinations for monopoly or in restraint of trade); Tenn. Code §§ 47-25-101 
to -112 (addressing arrangements, contracts, agreements, trusts, or combinations between persons or corporations). "
842,1," The relevant portions of CME's license agreements with ICE Clear US and ICE Clear Europe are identical. When quoting from 
the agreements, Court cites to only the agreement with ICE Clear US, but the quoted language is also in CME's agreement with 
ICE Clear Europe under the same pincite. See, e.g., Pls.' L.R. 56.1 Stmt., Ex. 3, dkt. no. 165-5, at 2. "
844,2," CME asks the Court to deny the defendants' motions on the ground that their Local Rule 56.1 statement of facts contain errors 
and misrepresentations. See N.D. Ill. LR 56.1(b)(3)(A) & (B); Malec v. Sanford, 191 F.R.D. 581, 584 (N.D. Ill. 2000). The Court 
declines this request but has not considered any assertions or denials that contain facts that misrepresent the cited portion of the 
record or improper legal conclusions. "
845,3," The parties disagree whether the standards for implied consent, acquiescence, and/or estoppel by implied license are the 
same, an issue the Court addresses below."
845,4," The defendants have indicated in their memorandum in support of their motion for summary judgment, but not in the motion 
itself, that they seek judgment on their misuse defense. The Court takes this as a cross-motion. This does not change the 
outcome of this decision. "
846,5," As with their trademark misuse defense, the defendants have indicated in their memorandum in support of their motion for 
summary judgment, though not in the motion itself, that they seek summary judgment on the defense they frame as estoppel by 
implied licenses. The Court assumes for purposes of discussion that they have cross-moved for summary judgment, but this 
does not change the outcome."
846,6," The Court notes that the affirmative defense of laches is similar to that of acquiescence, but ""acquiescence implies active 
consent,"" whereas ""laches denotes a merely passive consent."" Hyson USA, 821 F.3d at 940. Because neither party addressed 
the laches defense with respect to the defendants' conduct after the termination of the agreements, and because the defendants 
cite no case law relating to laches or suggesting that they have invoked the defense of laches in their contention there was an 
implied license, the Court need not address it. See id. (""[A]lthough our cases sometimes blend the doctrines of acquiescence 
and laches, they are formally distinct and should be analyzed separately.""). "
847,7," Even if the defendants ultimately establish their acquiescence defense, CME's claim could ""be revived"" if it ""can show that 
'inevitable confusion' would result from dual use of the marks."" Hyson USA, 821 F.3d at 941 (citation omitted). Because neither 
party raises this issue, the Court need not address it here. "
850,8," CME alleges deceptive trade practices in violation of 815 Ill. Comp. Stat. 510/1 and unfair competition in violation of Illinois 
common law. Both claims are subject to the same standards as the federal infringement claims. AHP Subsidiary Holding Co. v. 
Stuart Hale Co., 1 F.3d 611, 619 (7th Cir. 1993); McGraw-Edison Co. v. Walt Disney Prods., 787 F.2d 1163, 1173 n.9, 1174 (7th 
Cir. 1986). Thus the Court need not engage in a separate analysis of these claims. "
851,9," ICE also asserts affirmative defenses relating to these counterclaims. The Court need not address those defenses separately 
because the analysis is the same regardless of whether they are framed as counterclaims or defenses."
851,10," The ICE Licensees challenged the mark's validity in their initial counterclaims and CME moved to dismiss those counterclaims 
due to licensee estoppel. CME contends in its opening brief that the Court granted that motion and dismissed the ICE Licensee's 
counterclaims due to licensee estoppel, but that does not appear to be correct. The Court did not grant that motion to dismiss. 
Rather, at a hearing on May 17, 2018, the Court instructed the defendants to file a response to the motion to dismiss addressing 
the issue of licensee estoppel, and the defendants indicated that they instead would amend their answer and counterclaims. The 
defendants amended the counterclaim so that only ICE raised the validity counterclaims, dkt. no. 41, and the Court terminated 
CME's motion to dismiss after CME filed an amended complaint, see dkts. no. 69, 74. "
857,11," CME has cited to six items on the docket in support of this proposition (as well as to six paragraphs in the defendants' Local 
Rule 56.1 Statement of Facts that appear to provide support for a different proposition). The Court has cited to the only two 
relevant items that included pincites. CME also has cited to a nineteen-page motion for a protective order, dkt. no. 51, a five-
page motion to compel a deposition, dkt. no. 101, an eleven-page memorandum in support of that motion, dkt. no. 104, and a 
six-page joint report on discovery, dkt. no. 170—all without pincites. None of the cited documents show that the defendants had 
notice of the new allegations. "
858,12," In support of this proposition, the defendants also have cited to six documents described in the previous footnote. Again, none 
of these documents supports the defendants' contention that the ICE Licensees had notice of the new claims."
858,13," Accordingly, the Court need not address the argument (raised only in the defendants' reply brief) that these claims are barred 
by the doctrine of laches."
858,14," Courts generally consider seven factors in addressing a likelihood of confusion. AutoZone, 543 F.3d at 929. Because the 
parties do not address the seven factors, the Court need not address each factor in detail. Regardless, a discussion of all of the 
factors would lead to the same outcome. "
860,15," Although ICE has moved for summary judgment on the breach of contract claim, the motion is misplaced because CME did 
not allege in its complaint that ICE breached a contract. "
869,1," In 2014, HRI's competitor, Charah, became the exclusive marketing agent for the Rodemacher Power Station and Madison 3 
Unit. "
870,2," JRC referred to NRG and LaGen collectively in its First Amended Master Petition, and NRG and LaGen together filed pleadings 
below and in this appeal."
870,3," In previous petitions, JRC had contended that HRI and NRG/LaGen had attempted to restrain trade and monopolize ""the CCP 
market"" or the market for ""CCPs and related products."" However, in its First Amended Master Petition for Damages, it more 
narrowly contended that these defendants had engaged in antitrust violations with regard to ""Louisiana's C-618 fly ash industry."""
870,4," As noted by the trial court in its written reasons for judgment, neither Cleco nor Entergy are parties to this litigation."
870,5," JRC's motion for partial summary judgment was actually filed prior to the filing of its First Amended Master Petition for 
Damages. The motion was scheduled for hearing together with exceptions of no cause of action filed by HRI and NRG/LaGen 
with regard to JRC's previous ""Master Petition for Damages."" Following that hearing, the trial court sustained the exceptions of 
no cause of action related to all of JRC's antitrust claims under  La. R.S. 51:122  and 51:123, dismissing those claims without 
prejudice, subject to JRC's right to amend within thirty days. Accordingly, it also denied as moot JRC's motion for partial 
summary judgment. JRC then filed its First Amended Master Petition for Damages, and HRI and NRG/LaGen again filed 
exceptions of no cause of action. However, on appeal of the trial court's subsequent judgment sustaining those exceptions of no cause of action and dismissing 
JRC's antitrust claims with prejudice, this court reversed the judgment sustaining the exceptions of no cause of action and also 
vacated the earlier judgment denying JRC's motion for partial summary judgment as moot. In doing so, this court noted that 
because the trial court's rulings with respect to the exceptions of no cause of action had been reversed, JRC's motion for partial 
summary judgment on the issues of per se antitrust mode of analysis and joint venture was ""ripe for judicial determination."" "
871,," Thus, this court remanded the matter with instructions that the trial court ""consider and rule on JRC's motion for partial summary 
judgment."" John River Cartage, Inc. v. Louisiana Generating, LLC, 2018-1611 (La. App. 1st Cir. 12/19/18), 2018 La. App.

267 So. 3d 1129. On remand, JRC moved to reset its motion for partial summary judgment."
871,6," Defendants HRI and NRG/LaGen also filed motions for partial summary judgment, seeking dismissal of JRC's conversion and 
conspiracy to commit conversion claims, contending that JRC could not establish that it owned the Grey Stone product it 
accused them of converting."
871,7," In its memorandum in support of its motion, NRG/LaGen further stated that it joined in HRI's motion for partial summary 
judgment as to JRC's antitrust claims and adopted HRI's arguments."
871,8," As to HRI's and NRG/LaGen's motions for partial summary judgment seeking dismissal of JRC's conversion claims, in its 
written reasons, the trial court found that genuine issues of material fact remained as to those claims. Accordingly, in its 
December 4, 2019 judgment, the trial court also denied those motions. Neither HRI nor NRG/LaGen has appealed that portion of 
the judgment, and, thus, the conversion claims are not before us."
871,9," As set forth in  La. R.S. 51:135, all interlocutory judgments in cases involving antitrust claims shall be appealable within five 
days and shall be heard and determined within twenty days after the appeal is lodged. "
872,10," The Louisiana statute applies to intrastate commerce, whereas the Sherman Antitrust Act applies to interstate commerce and 
foreign trade. See  La. R.S. 51:121,  La. R.S. 51:122, & 15 U.S.C. § 1. "
873,11," HN9[
] A third method of analyzing whether a conspiracy is unreasonable is the abbreviated ""quick look"" analysis under the 
rule of reason, which is applied when ""an observer with even a rudimentary understanding of economics could conclude that the 
arrangements in question would have an anticompetitive effect on customers and markets."" California Dental Ass'n v. Fed. 
Trade Comm'n, 526 U.S. 756, 770, 119 S. Ct. 1604, 1612, 143 L. Ed. 2d 935 (1999). The quick-look approach does not require 
an elaborate industry analysis. Rather, when the restraint is not per se unreasonable, but the likelihood of anticompetitive effects 
is obvious, the proponent of the restraint must show some competitive justification for it. Thus, once the restraint is deemed 
facially anticompetitive, the burden shifts to its proponent for justification on procompetitive grounds. Realcomp II, Ltd. v. Fed. 
Trade Comm'n, 635 F.3d 815, 825 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 565 U.S. 942, 132 S. Ct. 400, 181 L. Ed. 2d 257 (2011). "

a particular Challenged Statement is unreasonable as a matter of law. "
923,10," In support of this argument, Post relies on Reitman v. Champion Petfoods USA, Inc., CV181736DOCJPRX, 2019 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 221941, 2019 WL 7169792, at *9 (C.D. Cal. Oct. 30, 2019). There, the court determined that individualized issues 
predominated where plaintiffs sought certification of one class of purchasers of 23 different formulas of dog food whose 
packaging contained some of four sets of challenged statements. Specifically, the court found individualized issues 
predominated because whether the challenged phrases (""biologically appropriate,"" ""fresh,"" ""regional"" or ""local"") were false or 
misleading would require individualized analysis of the ingredients and production location of each different variety of dog food 
sold with those statements. Reitman is not persuasive for a number of reasons. First, plaintiffs here propose subclasses for 
purchasers of each Product, as opposed to seeking one broadly defined class as in Reitman. Second, in this case plaintiffs have 
produced sufficient evidence of materiality each of the Challenged Statements. That plaintiffs will have to prove that materiality 
for each Challenged Statement on each different Product for each subclass means this case is complex. But those issues are 
common and predominate across each subclass. There are no truly ""individualized"" issues given the way these claims are 
assessed under California's consumer protection statutes. Defendant's motion and stipulation to address the Reitman case (Dkt. 
Nos. 224, 225) are GRANTED. "
924,11," To the extent the scope or definition of the certified Subclasses needs to be amended in light of my rulings below with respect 
to preemption, the parties shall meet and confer and submit an agreed-to revised definition of the certified Subclasses. "
925,12," The focus of each of the cases is the application of the Supreme Court's Central Hudson test for regulations on commercial 
speech. In Ocheesee Creamery LLC v. Putnam, 851 F.3d 1228 (11th Cir. 2017), the court addressed whether the state could 
prohibit a dairy from advertising its ""skim milk products"" because they did not contain vitamin A. Applying the Central Hudson 
test, the Eleventh Circuit rejected the idea that misleading speech, subject to regulation under Central Hudson, could be defined 
as anything ""inconsistent with the state's preferred definition."" Id. at 1238. The case here does not address any state action other 
than the general application of California's consumer protection statutes to allegedly misleading speech. Similarly, in Dunagin v. 
City of Oxford, Miss., 718 F.2d 738 (5th Cir. 1983), the Fifth Circuit rejected the idea that a state can outright ban commercial 
speech that may not ""tell the whole truth"" about a product in light of the ""policy"" to generally ""leave it to the public to cope for 
themselves with Madison Avenue panache and hard sells."" Id. at 750. The Fifth Circuit, nonetheless, concluded that the state's 
ban on billboard's advertising alcohol satisfied the Central Hudson test and passed constitutional muster. Id.; see also Int'l Dairy 
Foods Ass'n v. Boggs, 622 F.3d 628, 637 (6th Cir. 2010) (where science was unsettled, a proposed label statement could not be 
considered ""inherently misleading"" as a matter of law and, therefore, application of remaining Central Hudson factors was 
necessary). Post implicitly concedes that these cases are inapposite by never discussing the Central Hudson factors, so central 
to the cases discussed above, in the case at bar. "
926,13," Post's reliance on cases challenging FDA attempts to ban or rewrite labels is similarly unhelpful. Those cases apply the 
Central Hudson test and District of Columbia circuit authority balancing restrictions on commercial speech with compelled 
speech concerns. The analyses in those cases are not helpful to my resolution of the questions before me. See, e.g., All. for Nat. 
Health U.S. v. Sebelius, 786 F. Supp. 2d 1, 24 (D.D.C. 2011) (applying Central Hudson and rejecting FDA's attempted rewrite of 
a label disclaimer, because ""[w]here the evidence supporting a claim is inconclusive, the First Amendment permits the claim to 
be made; the FDA cannot require a disclaimer that simply swallows the claim.""); Whitaker v. Thompson, 248 F. Supp. 2d 1, 11 
(D.D.C. 2002) (addressing FDA prohibitions on label claims). "
928,14," Plaintiffs' attempt to characterize this Challenged Statement as a structure function claim — a differently regulated claim that 
must be truthful and not misleading, Oppo. to MSJ at 19 — does not help them. Plaintiffs do not contest that ""good source of 
nutrients that are building blocks for your child's developing brain,"" specifically identifying iron, zinc, and B vitamins, is itself or in 
conjunction with other unidentified statements false or misleading. "
929,15," In Hadley v. Kellogg Sales Co., 16-CV-04955-LHK, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 136791, 2019 WL 3804661 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 13, 
2019), the court declined to find health claims preempted as approved FDAMA claims where the language on the packing was 
missing significant, materials words from the exact language approved by the FDA. 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 136791, [WL] at *21. 
Plaintiffs do not argue that is the case here and admit the underlined language is an approved FDAMA claim."
929,16," Plaintiffs do not rebut or otherwise address Post's characterizations regarding Krommenhock's deposition testimony that she 
does not intend to purchase Post cereals in the future."
929,17," Post's argument that injunctive relief is unnecessary because it adequately discloses its added sugar content (or will disclose it 
adequately in the future) will not be considered at this juncture. Whether past or current disclosures suffice to negate what may 
otherwise be false or misleading statements regarding the healthiness of Post's cereals should be determined, if necessary, 
following the jury's verdict. "
932,18," The questions of whether there is the required fit under Comcast and whether an expert's opinion should be excluded under 
Daubert are distinct. See Hadley I, 324 F. Supp. 3d at 1106 (""whether Gaskin's proposed conjoint analysis is sufficiently reliable 
from a methodological standpoint—and therefore admissible under Daubert—is a different issue from whether the conjoint 
analysis satisfies Comcast.""). Post challenges the fit of Gaskin's model and Weir's calculations as part of its opposition to Class 
Certification and as a separate ground in support of its motion for summary judgment; I will consider both the Comcast challenge 
and the more typical Daubert/reliability challenges on Post's motion to exclude."
932,19," Despite relying heavily on Judge Koh's opinion in Hadley I excluding Gaskin's ""demand realized model,"" Post never addresses 
why Gaskin's consumer impact model/conjoint survey analysis here differs from the one accepted by Judge Koh in Hadley I. 
Instead, it relies on inapposite cases. See, e.g., Townsend v. Monster Bev. Corp., 303 F. Supp. 3d 1010, 1049 (C.D. Cal. 2018) 
(rejecting survey that did not suggest materiality for challenged statements and suffered from focalism bias among other 
defects); In re 5-Hour Energy Mktg. and Sales Practices Litig., 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 220969, 2017 WL 2559615, at *10 (C.D. 
Cal. June 7, 2017) (rejecting damages model that used improper proxy for consumer value or restitution with respect to 
misrepresented feature and failed to account for value of other features); In re ConAgra Foods, Inc., 90 F. Supp. 3d 919, 1031 
(C.D. Cal. 2015) (questioning design of conjoint analysis where survey did not adequately connect ""100% Natural"" claim to no-
GMO theory, but nonetheless accepting the damages model that utilized the conjoint surveys plus a hedonic regression "
933,," analysis); In re NJOY, Inc. Consumer Class Action Litig., 120 F. Supp. 3d 1050, 1122 (C.D. Cal. 2015) (rejecting analysis that 
failed to account for market pricing); Apple, Inc. v. Samsung Elecs. Co., Ltd., 11-CV-01846-LHK, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29721, 
2014 WL 976898, at *12 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 6, 2014) (inadequate showing of price premia to support injunction in patent 
infringement case)."
933,20," Nor could he, according to Post, given the complex distribution chain and the number of different label variants over time. "
935,21," Plaintiffs also move to exclude Strombom's opinions regarding deficiencies in the Advantage Realized Model and Weir's 
calculations based on that model. However, as that model is not admissible, I need not reach these arguments. "
936,22," Defendant also move to exclude Silverman's opinions regarding the Advantage Realized Model, which has been excluded 
from this case."
936,23," Post's cases rejecting advertising experts' opinions based on experience are inapposite and not persuasive given plaintiffs' 
theory of liability in this case and Silverman's particular experience. See, e.g., Jones v. ConAgra Foods, Inc., C 12-01633 CRB, 
2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 81292, 2014 WL 2702726, at *15 (N.D. Cal. June 13, 2014) (noting expert multiple admissions of 
potential insignificance of ""100% natural label"" and noting that expert's ""rather startling admission might have something to do 
with the fact that there is no single, controlling definition of the word 'natural.'""); GPNE Corp. v. Apple, Inc., 12-CV-02885-LHK, 
2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53234, 2014 WL 1494247, at *5 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 16, 2014) (rejecting expert's proposed royalty rate based 
only on ""30 years of experience"" as ""classic ipse dixit"" reasoning). "
937,24," Whether ""all or most consumers"" were actually exposed to and relied on Challenged Statements are not relevant questions 
under the California consumer protection statutes at issue. Some of Hanssens' opinions might support Post's arguments that 
given the context and placement of the Challenged Statements on the labels, and in light of other unchallenged statements, 
some or all of the Challenged Statements would not be material to a reasonable consumer. That, however, is a merits question 
that does not defeat class certification or require summary judgment to Post. See supra at 9, discussing Bradach v. Pharmavite, 
LLC, 735 Fed. Appx. 251, 254 (9th Cir. 2018) (unpublished), cert. denied, 139 S. Ct. 491, 202 L. Ed. 2d 379 (2018) & Kumar v. 
Salov N.A. Corp., 14-CV-2411-YGR, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 92374, 2016 WL 3844334, at *4 (N.D. Cal. July 15, 2016). "
938,25," Citing no cases where mall intercept surveys were excluded, and not relying on any expert opinion but only on a citation to the 
National Academy of Sciences 2011 Survey Reference Guide, plaintiffs complain that Van Liere's mall intercept study's 
problems are so severe they do not simply undermine its weight but make it inadmissible. MTE Van Liere [Dkt. No. 191] at 5-6. I 
will not exclude Van Liere's study on the basis of that very limited and unsupported argument. "
940,26," Where experts point to ""an objective source demonstrating that his method and premises were generally accepted by or 
espoused by a recognized minority"" of those in the fields, the opinions may be admissible. Lust by & Through Lust v. Merrell 
Dow Pharms., 89 F.3d 594, 597 (9th Cir. 1996). The developing evidence around the effects of sugar in the diet, and the 
different views of practitioners in the field that are based on accepted sources and methodologies, make inapposite the concerns 
acknowledged by the Supreme Court in Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharms., Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 113 S. Ct. 2786, 125 L. Ed. 2d 469 
(1993) with respect to ""conjecture"" and ""known techniques"" with minimal support. Id. at 594 (recognizing that in ruling particular 
evidence admissible or inadmissible ""'a known technique which has been able to attract only minimal support within the 
community' . . . ""may properly be viewed with skepticism."" (internal citations omitted))."
940,27," In Reply, Post argues — without citation — that Greger missed ""numerous studies"" cited by its expert, Clemens. Reply on 
MTE Lustig & Greger at 12-13. I will not address unsupported arguments raised in Reply."
940,28," Post, instead, relies on ""pick and choose"" cases where courts have criticized experts who picked and chose sources when 
conducting literature reviews and otherwise did not explain the conclusions and bases of their selected sources. See, e.g., Lust 
by & Through Lust v. Merrell Dow Pharms., 89 F.3d 594, 596 (9th Cir. 1996) (excluding expert who selectively picked the 
literature reviewed); In re Lipitor (Atorvastatin Calcium) Mktg., Sales Practices and Products Liab. Litig., 174 F. Supp. 3d 911, 
929 (D.S.C. 2016) (rejecting expert's literature review resulting from ""cherry—picking articles based on the authors' biases""). "
942,29," In a particularly unhelpful manner, plaintiffs argue Clemens is broadly unqualified and then point to numerous instances in his 
deposition where he, arguably, walked back assertions made either in his Report or in his deposition. But plaintiffs do not identify 
with any specificity the paragraphs, pages, or subject matters from Clemens' Report that they want excluded because he is 
unqualified. MTE Clements [Dkt. No. 184] at 6-8. This broad-brush approach is not helpful. Identifying the parts and specific 
opinions in a report that a party wants to exclude tied to the evidence supporting that specific exclusion request is required, 
especially in this sort of case where many of the experts are opining on very broad ranges of topics resulting in numerous 
opinions."
942,30," Clemens declares: ""I did not recall a number of these articles at the time and so said that I had not seen them previously. 
Following my deposition, and as part of preparing my errata sheet, I reviewed my files to confirm whether I had in fact previously 
reviewed those documents. I identified several articles that I had previously reviewed in preparation of my report in this matter, 
but that I did not specifically recall during my deposition."" Dkt. No. 200 ¶ 2. In his Declaration, Clemens also addresses other 
articles — one by Lustig and others that were introduced as his deposition that he admits he had not considered at that time — 
and explains his view of them now. Id. ¶¶ 4-6."
942,31," Plaintiffs' remaining insufficiency challenges — that Clemens failed to consider industry funding a source of bias and that he 
relied on ""outdated"" sources — likewise go to the weight not the admissibility of Clemens' testimony. "
953,1," All ECF page citations are to the page number in the CM/ECF header, which does not always match the document's internal 
pagination, particularly in briefs with separately paginated prefatory material such as a table of contents."
953,2," There are exceptions to the face-of-the-complaint rule. See, e.g., Toone v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 716 F.3d 516, 521 (10th 
Cir. 2013). Nothing in this case requires the Court to examine whether those exceptions might apply. "
954,3," The Court says ""apparently"" because, as noted, the License Agreement contains a clause contemplating the need for ICC 
approval of the rights granted by USACA to Global—thus casting doubt on whether USACA's reinstatement would have 
automatically given ICC imprimatur to Global."
954,4," Plaintiff does not explain what rights persist after USACA's expulsion from the ICC. The License Agreement contains a clause 
that contemplates ""termination of USACA's membership with ICC"" and requires USACA to ""cause ICC or ICC's nominated body 
for the development of cricket in USA, to execute the necessary agreements which shall have the effect of providing or 
continuing, as the case may be, the Licensed Rights to [Global]."" (¶ 44.) But it is unclear what right USACA has or had to cause 
the ICC or any successor governing body in the United States to enter into an agreement with Global. "
956,5," Several Defendants are domiciled in California (see ¶¶ 12-14, 18) and Plaintiff alleges that ""Defendants' combination, trust, or 
conspiracy was substantially carried out and effectuated within the State of California"" (¶ 153). "
957,6," Plaintiff also asserts two other injuries, neither of which is relevant to the present analysis. First, Plaintiff alleges that it was 
injured by the ICC's interference with the License Agreement between USACA and Global. (Id. at 23.) That allegation, if true, 
would be relevant to Plaintiff's standing to pursue its contractual interference claim (Count 7). But the Supreme Court has 
rejected any ""commutative"" theory of standing, by which a plaintiff borrows the injury of one cause of action in an effort to sustain 
standing in another. DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U.S. 332, 352, 126 S. Ct. 1854, 164 L. Ed. 2d 589 (2006). ""[A] plaintiff 
must demonstrate standing for each claim he seeks to press."" Id. Second, Plaintiff alleges that its ""investments of time and 
money (including the hiring of and payments to experts that were part of its RFP Response) were wasted by this rigged 
process."" (ECF No. 64 at 23.) Plaintiff did not allege as much in its complaint, however, and ""[p]laintiffs cannot rectify their 
pleading deficiencies by asserting new facts in an opposition to a motion to dismiss."" Smith v. Pizza Hut, Inc., 694 F. Supp. 2d 
1227, 1230 (D. Colo. 2010). In any event, although damages are a classic Article III injury and usually redressable by a money 
judgment, these kinds of damages would not amount to an ""antitrust injury,"" as explained below. "
959,7," Plaintiff insists that it ""has not claimed that [the] relevant market can sustain only a single [ICC-sanctioned T20 league], and, to 
the extent that Defendants make that claim, [Plaintiff] has not had an opportunity to engage in discovery to evaluate it."" (ECF No. 
64 at 38-39 (citations omitted).) This is beside the point. Whether or not the United States can sustain more than one cricket 
league (of any type, ICC-sanctioned or not), USA Cricket seeks only one partner, with the intent to develop one league. Plaintiff "
960,," wants to be that sole partner, just as Global wanted to be USACA's sole partner. (See ¶ 41 (Global negotiated with USACA to 
create ""the only USACA sanctioned and ICC approved professional T20 league in the United States"" (internal quotation marks 
omitted; emphasis added)))."
960,8," Even if Plaintiff had made such an argument, such damages do not state an antitrust injury, as explained above. "
961,9," To be clear, the federal antitrust claims did not open the door to supplemental jurisdiction over the state-law claims. 
Supplemental jurisdiction embraces ""all other claims that are so related to claims in the action within [the Court's] original 
jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy under Article III of the United States Constitution."" 28 U.S.C. § 
1367(a). If Plaintiff's federal antitrust claims had stated an Article III case or controversy, then the Court would have had original 
jurisdiction over them (through Article III and 28 U.S.C. § 1331). But, as to those claims, it turns out that this Court has only ever 
had ""jurisdiction to determine its own jurisdiction."" United States v. Ruiz, 536 U.S. 622, 628, 122 S. Ct. 2450, 153 L. Ed. 2d 586 
(2002). It has never had original jurisdiction, and so it cannot exercise supplemental jurisdiction. "
963,1, The following abbreviations are used herein: 
964,," ""DE    "" = Docket Entry in this case ""2AC"" = Second Amended Complaint (DE 48) "
965,2," Dr. Ellison cites to a number of other articles in the 2AC. Many of these articles are from the early 2000s, and they do not 
specifically refer to ABOS. (See 2AC ¶¶ 15 (citing a CMS Director Survey and Certification Group article from 2004 concerning 
the requirements for hospital medical staff privileging); ¶ 16 (citing two studies from 2007 and 2009 regarding hospital privileging 
as it relates to board certification); ¶ 18 (citing a 2005 article titled ""Board Certification as Prerequisite for Hospital Staff 
Privileges"")) "
967,3," The Removed Complaint alleged, less specifically, that Dr. Ellison is located in California and that ABOS is headquartered in 
North Carolina. (DE no 1-1 ¶¶ 2, 3; DE 1-3, Civil Cover Sheet) "
972,4," To be clear, there is no allegation that Dr. Ellison is being forced to buy two products, when he only wanted one. Instead, he 
alleges that he wants both products: (1) to sit for phase II of the ABOS board certification test so that he can obtain board 
certification (2AC ¶ 70), and thereby obtain (2) staffing privileges from a northern New Jersey hospital. (See, e.g., id. ¶ 67)"
972,5," I therefore express no further opinion on other issues raised by ABOS. These include questions of venue, jurisdiction and 
standing raised by a speculative allegation that a California physician theoretically would apply for, but is likely to be denied, staff 
privileges at any one of a number of New Jersey hospitals. "

980,8, [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] 
982,9, [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT]
982,10," The Court notes that some Defendants, such as Bank of America, Deutsche Bank, and HSBC Defendants, are currently in 
settlement negotiations with Plaintiffs and thus the case remains active. See, e.g., Doc. 636 (letter from Plaintiffs advising Court 
that settlement negotiations are ongoing). "
985,*, This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3. 
987,1," This Court draws the facts (accepted as true for purposes of the present motion) from Plaintiffs' second amended complaint

987,2," Plaintiffs allege that Bally acquired SHFL Entertainment, Inc. on November 25, 2013, and SGC acquired Bally on November 
21, 2014. Thereafter, SGC and Bally began using ""Shuffle Master"" or ""SHFL"" as trade names and selling or leasing card 
shufflers based upon the patents at issue in this case under the Shuffle Master or SHFL names. [32] at ¶ 17. "
990,3," See Brunswick Corp. v. Riegel Textile Corp., 752 F.2d 261, 264-66 (7th Cir. 1984) (""Getting a patent by means of a fraud on 
the Patent Office can, but does not always, violate section 2 of the Sherman Act. A patent entitles the patentee to prevent others 
from making or selling the patented product..., and he may be able to use this legal right to restrict competition. But 'may' is not 
'does'; and for a patent fraud actually to create or threaten to create monopoly power, and hence violate section 2, three 
conditions must be satisfied besides proof that the defendant obtained a patent by fraud""— ""the patent must dominate a real 
market""; ""the invention sought to be patented must not be patentable""; and ""the patent must have some colorable validity, 
conferred for example by the patentee's efforts to enforce it by bringing patent-infringement suits. Indeed, some formulations of 
the antitrust offense of patent fraud make it seem that the offense is not the fraudulent procuring of a patent in circumstances 
that create monopoly power but the bringing of groundless suits for patent infringement."") (emphasis added). "
991,4," This Court may consider the release because it is part of the settlement agreement referenced in Plaintiffs' complaint. See 
Hecker v. Deere & Co., 556 F.3d 575, 582-83 (7th Cir. 2009)(A court normally may not consider extrinsic evidence without 
converting a motion to dismiss into one for summary judgment; but where a document is referenced in the complaint and central 
to plaintiff's claims, the court may consider it in ruling on the motion to dismiss.)."
991,5," Antitrust standing, unlike Article III standing, is not a jurisdictional requirement; rather, antitrust standing asks which plaintiffs 
may bring the cause of action. See McGarry & McGarry, LLC v. Bankr. Mgmt. Sols., Inc., 937 F.3d 1056, 1063 (7th Cir. 2019) 
(noting the distinction—and potential for confusion—between the two). "
994,1," The following facts are taken from Plaintiffs' amended complaint and are accepted as true at this stage. See Tamayo v. 
Blagojevich, 526 F.3d 1074, 1081 (7th Cir. 2008) (stating that, at the motion-to-dismiss stage, the court ""accept[s] as true all 
well-pleaded facts alleged"")."
994,2," The Defendants, noting that the EmblemHealth and ConnectiCare assignments took effect after Plaintiffs filed their original 
complaint (but before they filed their amended complaint), contend that those assignments ""are insufficient to convey "
995,," constitutional standing to Plaintiffs."" Mem. in Supp. of Mallinckrodt's Mot. to Dismiss at 4, ECF No. 188; see Mem. in Supp. of 
Express Scripts Entities' Mot. to Dismiss at 13-14, ECF No. 191. But, for reasons discussed below, the Court is not persuaded 
that Plaintiffs' constitutional (or prudential) standing depends on the EmblemHealth and ConnectiCare assignments. "
996,3," Although Mallinckrodt frames this issue as one of Article III standing, Mem. in Supp. of Mallinckrodt's Mot. to Dismiss at 3-4, the 
Court deems it more properly a matter of prudential standing. See G&S Holdings LLC v. Continental Cas. Co., 697 F.3d 534, 
540 (7th Cir. 2012) (stating that the ""prudential limitations on the exercise of federal jurisdiction"" include that, ""in general, the 
plaintiffs must assert their own legal rights and interests, and cannot rest their claims to relief on the legal rights or interests of 
third parties"")."
996,4," Defendants again present this issue as one of Article III standing, see Mem. in Supp. of. Mallinckrodt's Mot. to Dismiss at 5; 
Mem. in Supp. of Express Scripts Entities' Mot. to Dismiss at 11-13. But the question here is whether claims for injunctive relief 
were assigned to the Plaintiffs or instead retained by the assigners, a matter of prudential standing. See RK Co. v. See, 622 
F.3d 846, 851 (7th Cir. 2010) (""[P]rudential limitations include concerns about a claim's rightful owner.""). "
997,5," As Defendants note, the PHC assignment Plaintiffs have attached to the amended complaint does not identify the claims that 
were assigned. Specifically, the agreement states that PHC ""assign[s] and transfer[s] . . . the rights and causes of action set 
forth"" in a specific exhibit, yet Plaintiffs have not provided the Court with that exhibit. FAC Ex. F, PHC Agreement at 1, ECF No. 
165-6."
997,6," Mallinckrodt's assertion that the exemplar assignments are limited to claims under the Medicare Secondary Payer Provision 
also is unavailing. See Mem. in Supp. of Mallinckrodt's Mot. to Dismiss at 5-8. To support this contention, Mallinckrodt cites a 
portion of the PMPI Assignment that in fact defeats its argument. See id. at 7 (""[A]ll claims that have been or can be identified by 
MSP Recovery as being recoverable by the Client pursuant to the Medicare Secondary Payer Act or any other contractual,

998,7," Because standing is a threshold issue and any amendment likely will impact the nature and scope of Plaintiffs' claims, the

1001,1," The title of the Motion and its introduction imply that it is directed to all of the Counterclaims, see e.g. Dkt. 36 at 2 (Notice of 
Motion, stating ""[t]he counterclaims should be dismissed""), but the memorandum in support of the Motion only addresses the 
counterclaims for inequitable conduct, tortious interference, and antitrust violations. See id. The Motion does not address 
Counterclaims One through Eight for noninfringement and invalidity of the asserted patents. Counterclaims Five through Eight, 
which allege invalidity, include allegations that the asserted patents are invalid for improper inventorship. See, e.g. Dkt. 33 ¶ 69 
(""As yet another example, all claims of the '155 patent are invalid for improper inventorship.""). However, the memorandum in 
support of the Motion only addresses Defendant's alleged improper inventorship in the context of the inequitable conduct claims. 
See Dkt. 36 at 15 (addressing ""allegations of inequitable conduct based on inventorship""). Nor does the memorandum in support 
of the Motion address the Answer, including its Fourth Affirmative Defense of inequitable conduct as to each of the four asserted 
patents. See Dkt. 32 at 11-16. Because the Answer and Counterclaims One through Eight are not addressed by the Motion, they 
are not discussed in this Order."

1009,1," Every futures exchange must either provide its own clearing services or otherwise contract with a clearinghouse like BOTCC. A 
clearinghouse is an intermediary between buyers and sellers; it acts as the buyer for every seller and the seller for every buyer. 
The clearinghouse thus as-sumes counterparty risk; if a trade falls through on one end, the clearing-house shields the other 
side."
1009,2," ""Open interest"" refers to trades or contracts that remain outstanding at the clearinghouse and is used as a predictor of liquidity."

1010,4," The parties also debate whether USFE's open interest claims are actionable at all. The district court did not rule on this issue

1010,5," The doctrine takes its name from two Supreme Court decisions: Eastern R.R. Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, 
Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 81 S. Ct. 523, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464 (1961) (holding railroads' publicity campaign to promote legislation and law en-
forcement practices that harmed trucking industry did not violate the Sherman Act); and United Mine Workers of America v. 
Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 670, 85 S. Ct. 1585, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626 (1965) (""Joint efforts to influence public officials do not violate 
the antitrust laws even though intended to eliminate competition."")."
1010,6," Mercatus describes these exceptions as ""two specific kinds of con-duct"" that trigger a single exception to immunity: the ""sham 
exception,"" first mentioned in Noerr itself. See Mercatus, 641 F.3d at 842. We discuss them as separate exceptions to [**6]  
avoid confusing the distinction between ""sham lawsuits"" and the broader ""sham exception"" Noerr contemplates. "
1011,7," Should an antitrust plaintiff overcome this threshold, it still must demonstrate the alleged misrepresentation ""(1) was 
intentionally made, with knowledge of its falsity; and (2) was material, in the sense that it ac-tually altered the outcome of the

misleading information to the Commission in connection with a DCM application. Although they do not touch on ""perjury,"" citation 
to these statutes similarly impresses upon the submitter that designation review and approval depends on accurate information.

1016,12," Even though exchange and clearing rules can be self-certified with-out the Commission's input, that is not what happened

required to exercise its authority to review and approve. 7 U.S.C. § 7a-2(c)(4)(C) (""If prior approval is requested . . . the 
Commission shall take final action on the request . . . ."") (emphasis added). "

1021,1," Such agreements may apply only to the initial sale/lease of the property, to all subsequent sales/leases that occur within a 
specified time frame, or in perpetuity."
1021,2," Haddad operated under the business name ""Jeanette Haddad, Broker,"" and Scalzo operated through his real estate franchise, 
Century 21 Scalzo Realty, Inc. (Scalzo Realty). For simplicity, we do not distinguish between those individuals and their 
corporate entities in this opinion, referring to them, respectively, as ""Haddad"" and ""Scalzo."" We note that, subsequent to the 
filing of their action, Scalzo Realty was added as a necessary party but thereafter was defaulted for failure to plead. 
Subsequently, the plaintiffs withdrew their action as to Scalzo Realty. "
1022,3," It is not entirely clear that the agreements governing parcel 15 are true list-back agreements. Although they include a reference 
to exclusive listing of that property, those agreements could plausibly be read to mean that the plaintiffs earned the $1 million 
commission on the completion of the sale of that parcel by Woodland to Windemere, on the basis of the plaintiffs' role in 
facilitating that sale, and that payment was simply to be delayed until Windemere was able to develop the property. The trial 
court, for example, having found the parties' various purchase and listing agreements to be ambiguous, concluded that one 
possible interpretation of the agreements was that the plaintiffs had earned a commission with respect to parcel 15 prior to 
having performed any services for Windemere. Should these cases ultimately return to the trial court, it will fall to that court to 
determine whether those agreements are list-back agreements, the enforcement of which potentially implicates antitrust 
considerations or, rather, merely consideration for the plaintiffs' prior services. Compare, e.g., Kaiser Steel Corp. v. Mullins, 455 
U.S. 72, 81-82, 102 S. Ct. 851, 70 L. Ed. 2d 833 (1982) (illegality defense should be entertained in those circumstances in which 
its rejection would be to enforce conduct forbidden by antitrust law), with Kelly v. Kosuga, 358 U.S. 516, 521, 79 S. Ct. 429, 3 L. 
Ed. 2d 475 (1959) (rejecting illegality defense when judgment would not have enforced allegedly illegal aspect of contract)."
1022,4," The precise terms of the various contract documents vary, and are ambiguous, in ways that are not directly relevant to the legal 
issues now before us but that likely will need to be addressed on remand. "
1023,5," Among other things, § 20-325a places certain restrictions on the ability of a real estate broker to bring an action to recover 
commissions arising out of a real estate transaction."
1023,6," In order for the plaintiffs to prevail, all three of these defenses must fail on appeal."
1023,7," More broadly, this provision of the Sherman Act, which is only a few sentences long, is understood effectively to delegate to the 
courts the authority to determine what constitutes an unreasonable restraint of trade and, therefore, an antitrust violation. See In 
re Cox Enters., 871 F.3d 1093, 1097 (10th Cir. 2017). As a result, although antitrust actions and defenses technically are 
statutory, judicial decisions interpreting and applying the Sherman Act tend to analyze antitrust issues more like common-law 
questions, with public policy and economic concerns at the forefront, rather than according to traditional methods of statutory 
construction. See R. Posner, ""The Meaning of Judicial Self-Restraint,"" 59 Ind. L.J. 1, 5-6 (1983); see also 2 P. Areeda & H. 
Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law (3d Ed. 2007) ¶ 301a, pp. 6-7. We further note that, to the extent that the trial court read General Statutes § 35-26 literally to prohibit any ""contract, 
combination, or conspiracy in restraint of any part of trade or commerce""; see footnote 8 of this opinion; that court's reading was 
incorrect. HN2[
] Every commercial contract, by definition, constitutes a restraint of trade. Procaps S.A. v. Patheon, Inc., 845 F.3d 1072, 1081 (11th Cir. 2016). If a dog breeder contracts to sell three puppies to a family, commerce in those three puppies is 
restrained, insofar as no other customer may purchase them. The antitrust laws proscribe only those contracts that 
unreasonably restrain trade. See, e.g., id.; Tremont Public Advisors, LLC v. Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority, 333 
Conn. 672, 695, 217 A.3d 953 (2019). "
1024,8," General Statutes § 35-26 provides: ""Every contract, combination, or conspiracy in restraint of any part of trade or commerce is 
unlawful."""
1024,9," The parties disagree as to whether the defendants' antitrust special defense also can be understood to allege a violation of 
General Statutes § 35-29, the state analogue of § 3 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 14. Because we conclude that tying 
arrangements are evaluated under the same legal standard under both the Sherman Act and the Clayton Act, we need not 
resolve this dispute. See part III C of this opinion. Moreover, although the defendants correctly note that § 35-29 is broader in 
scope than § 3 of the Clayton Act—insofar as the former statute, unlike the latter, (1) applies to anticompetitive conduct in the 
provision of services as well as commodities, and (2) is not limited to interstate commerce—the defendants do not contend that 
anything in the text or history of § 35-29 warrants the application of a different legal standard. "
1025,10," See, e.g., Miller v. Granados, 529 F.2d 393, 396-97 (5th Cir. 1976); MacManus v. A. E. Realty Partners, 146 Cal. App. 3d 275, 
288, 194 Cal. Rptr. 567 (1983); King City Realty, Inc. v. Sunpace Corp., 291 Or. 573, 581, 633 P.2d 784 (1981); see also In re 
Real Estate Litigation, 95 Wn. 2d 297, 301-304, 622 P.2d 1185 (1980) (addressing jurisdictional issues)."
1025,11," Although courts sometimes use the terms ""economic power"" and ""market power"" interchangeably, in this opinion, for clarity, 
we use the term ""economic power"" in the more general sense to encompass all of the various factors that courts have indicated 
may satisfy the first prong of Northern Pacific. [***15]  These include not only market power (a substantial or dominant share of a 
defined, distinct market), but also uniqueness, special desirability, a legal monopoly such as a patent, and anything else that 
might permit a seller to force a buyer to agree to acquire an unwanted tied product. "
1026,12," A tying arrangement, such as requiring that consumers purchase laces in tandem with a new pair of shoes or commit to 
buying a vendor's paper when purchasing its photocopy machines, might, for example, result in increased efficiencies, satisfy 
consumer preferences for bundled sales, protect a seller's good will, or facilitate economically desirable forms of price 
discrimination. See, e.g., 9 P. Areeda & H. Hovenkamp, supra, ¶ 1703g, pp. 51-54; 9 P. Areeda & H. Hovenkamp, supra, ¶ 
1720, pp. 259-61; D. Carlton & M. Waldman, ""Robert Bork's Contributions to Antitrust Perspectives on Tying Behavior,"" 57 J.L. & 
Econ. at S121-26 (2014). "
1027,13," Justice O'Connor's concurring opinion went so far as to argue that tying arrangements should be deemed presumptively legal, 
unless (1) the seller has market power in the tying product market, (2) there is ""a substantial threat that the tying seller will 
acquire market power in the [tied product] market,"" and (3) the tied product is one that some consumers might wish to purchase 
separately without also purchasing the tying product. Jefferson Parish Hospital District No. 2 v. Hyde, supra, 466 U.S. at 37-39. 
If all three conditions are met, then the antitrust claims would be evaluated under a rule of reason analysis. Id. "
1029,14," We note that defining a relevant product and geographic market for purposes of the federal antitrust laws is a highly technical 
process that typically requires expert testimony. See, e.g., McWane, Inc. v. Federal Trade Commission, 783 F.3d 814, 829 (11th 
Cir. 2015), cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___, 136 S. Ct. 1452, 194 L. Ed. 2d 550 (2016); Hynix Semiconductor, Inc. v. Rambus, Inc., 
Docket No. CV-00-20905 RMW, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 123822, 2008 WL 73689, *10 n.13 (N.D. Cal. January 5, 2008). The 
most common test of a proposed market definition asks whether there is sufficient cross-elasticity of demand that a small but 
significant and nontransitory price increase will lead customers to look elsewhere—both productwise and geographically—for 
substitutes. See, e.g., DSM Desotech, Inc. v. 3D Systems Corp., 749 F.3d 1332, 1339-40 (2014); Theme Promotions, Inc. v. 
News America Marketing FSI, 546 F.3d 991, 1002 (2008). Only once the relevant product and geographic markets have been 
carefully defined can the trier of fact assess the relevant antitrust variables, whether it be market share, economic power, market 
concentration, barriers to entry, or the like. "
1030,15," Indeed, given the recent evolution of the tying doctrine in the federal courts, it is fair to ask whether the Northern Pacific rule, in 
its present form, should continue to be considered a per se prohibition on tying in any sense. See, e.g., 9 P. Areeda & H. 
Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law, supra, ¶ 1728c, pp. 375-76 (explaining that most lower courts now allow defendants to raise 
defense that tying arrangement is affirmatively justified by fact that it confers benefits not available by alternative means); E. 
Elhauge, ""Tying, Bundled Discounts, and the Death of the Single Monopoly Profit Theory,"" 123 Harv. L. Rev. 397, 425-26 (2009) 
(""It . . . now seems likely that a tie can be justified by evidence that the tie is the least restrictive way to achieve efficiencies large 
enough to offset the anticompetitive effects. Accordingly, today it is more accurate to read Supreme Court precedent on tying as 
embracing a rule of reason, where anticompetitive effects must be shown or inferred and procompetitive justifications are 
admissible.""); see also United States v. Microsoft Corp., 253 F.3d 34, 84, 346 U.S. App. D.C. 330 (D.C. Cir.) (rule of reason, 
rather than per se analysis, governs legality of tying arrangements involving platform software products), cert. denied, 534 U.S. 
952, 122 S. Ct. 350, 151 L. Ed. 2d 264 (2001). "
1031,16," See, e.g., Fran Welch Real Estate Sales, Inc. v. Seabrook Island Co., 621 F. Supp. 128, 137-38 (D.S.C. 1985) (summary 
judgment on real estate listback claim deemed inappropriate when (1) relevant market had not been defined, and (2) six month 
exclusive listing agreement was likely too short to unreasonably restrain competition), aff'd, 809 F.2d 1030 (4th Cir. 1987); 
Outdoor Resorts of America, Inc. v. Outdoor Resorts at Nettles Island, Inc., 379 So. 2d 471, 471-72 (Fla. App.) (rule of reason 
governed claim that purchase of recreational vehicle lot was tied to developer's exclusive right to rent lots at 50 percent 
commission when not in use), cert. denied, 388 So. 2d 1116 (Fla. 1980); see also Vande Guchte v. Kort, supra, 13 Neb. App. 
887 (holding that builder tie-in contract, which conditioned sale of lot on use of specific builder, was not per se illegal)."
1031,17," In some sense, then, Northern Pacific can be understood as an application of the essential facilities doctrine, which applies in 
antitrust cases in which a monopolist controls access to uniquely necessary infrastructure, such as a railroad or a port. See, e.g., 
MCI Communications Corp. v. American Telephone & Telegraph Co., 708 F.2d 1081, 1132 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 891, 
104 S. Ct. 234, 78 L. Ed. 2d 226 (1983). "
1033,18," For these same reasons, the trial court's conclusions that the listing agreements violated General Statutes § 35-27, which 
prohibits attempted monopolization, and General Statutes § 35-28, which prohibits price fixing arrangements, also cannot be 
sustained. At the same time, the fact that the necessary market analyses were not performed means that we need not address 
the plaintiffs' other claims, such as that the Appellate Court incorrectly concluded that the defendants were coerced into agreeing 
to the list-back provisions and that the Reserve market was foreclosed to other commercial brokers. We note that there was testimony at trial that three such ""floating zone"" properties were available in Danbury alone, which would 
seem to militate against the plaintiffs' theory that the Reserve was uniquely desirable. The trial court neither credited nor 
declined to credit that testimony. "
1034,19," Although the trial court rejected the latter theory in its memorandum of decision, it did so not as the result of any contrary 
factual findings but, rather, because the court was of the view that, because any leverage that the defendants were able to 
assert by virtue of their administrative appeal was legal, it was irrelevant to the antitrust analysis. As we have explained, the 
court was mistaken in that regard. Notably, the defendants conceded at trial that they proceeded to purchase the land, despite the list-back requirements, because 
it made good economic sense to do so and they believed that the deal was likely to be profitable. For their part, representatives 
of Woodland testified that they had procompetitive reasons for agreeing to adopt the list-back provisions in the first place, 
notably, the enhanced efficiency and quality control stemming from having a single team of brokers coordinate marketing for the 
Reserve, as well as the ability to negotiate below market commission rates."
1034,20," Of course, should a retrial ultimately be necessary, the parties will have the opportunity to make a record, and the trial court to 
make findings, about all of these factual issues. In this part of the opinion, we merely explain why, on the present record, we 
cannot impute to the trial court the findings necessary to sustain the judgment. "
1035,21," The Reserve, taken as a whole, spans 546 acres. We may take judicial notice of the fact that this represents two percent of 
the 42 square mile area of the city of Danbury. See Connecticut Economic Resource Center, Danbury, Connecticut: CERC

Co. v. Putnam Advisory Co., LLC, No. 12 CIV. 7372(AT), 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9088, 2020 WL 264146, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 17, 
2020)(alterations in original) (quoting Phoenix Light SF Ltd. v. Bank of N.Y. Mellon, No. 14 Civ. 10104, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
145044, 2017 WL 3973951, at*20 n.36 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 7, 2017)).Accordingly, the Court does not separately address the 
sufficiency of the claims against K.A. Steel."
1059,2," To the extent that allegations of a direct conspiracy are included in the Amended Complaint, the Court agrees with Defendants 
that they are insufficiently conclusory. (Dkt.79-1 at 11-12; see, e.g., Dkt. 51 at ¶ 103 (""Defendants intended to restrain trade, and 
did restrain trade, in Caustic Soda by reaching an agreement or understanding to end genuine price competition among 
themselves by supporting industry price increases and customer allocations; by manipulating a price index; by assisting each 
other with supply; by limiting domestic supply and exporting and selling Caustic Soda abroad (to keep it off the domestic 
market); and by concertedly fixing, raising, maintaining, or stabilizing the prices for Caustic Soda by other secret means and 
methods."")). "
1062,3," Defendants also argue that Plaintiffs included misleading information in their Amended Complaint because they excluded the 
2018 and 2019 average price information, which reflects decreased prices, from their price announcement graph. (Dkt. 79-1 at 
24; see Dkt. 79-3). Even if Plaintiffs had included those data points, as discussed above, it does not undercut their allegations 
that Defendants attempted to increase the prices by making announcements of price increases. Additionally, the pricing figures 
still show an overall increase of 73% between the first quarter of 2016 and the first quarter of 2019. (Dkt. 79-3; see Dkt. 91 at 34 
n.22). "
1063,4," Defendants also argue that Plaintiffs point to no authority for the alleged operating rate data; but Plaintiffs are not required to do 
so at this stage of the proceedings. "
1064,5," Plaintiffs further contend that it does not make economic sense that export prices soared even though Olin had entered the 
export market for the first time because economic theory predicts decreased export prices with new market entrants. (Dkt. 91 at 
40). "
1067,6," As for the arguments made by Westlake, Shintech, and Formosa USA that the Court already addressed in the discussion of the 
joint motion to dismiss (see, e.g., Dkt. 81-1 at 8-14 (arguing that Plaintiffs do not allege the price increase announcements 
resulted in the prices actually increasing for Westlake's contracts, that Westlake was engaging in follow-the-leader pricing 
behavior, that Plaintiffs fail to acknowledge exporting caustic soda made ""perfect business sense"" during the Class Period, and 
that the article regarding statements made by Axiall's CEO does not reflect the transcript of the phone call itself)), the Court will 
not repeat its discussion of those arguments in its discussion of the individual motions. "
1070,7," The parties dispute whether New York's choice-of-law rule applies the veil-piercing standard from the state of incorporation of 
the subsidiary or the parent corporation. (Dkt. 91 at 56; Dkt. 94 at 9). HN20[
] Courts have found that New York's choice-of-law 
rule applies the law of the subsidiary's state of incorporation. See Fletcher v. Atex, Inc., 68 F.3d 1451, 1456 (2d Cir. 1995) 
(""Because [subsidiary] was a Delaware corporation, Delaware law determines whether the corporate veil can be pierced in this 
instance.""); Nat'l Gear & Piston, Inc. v. Cummins Power Sys., LLC, 975 F. Supp. 2d 392, 401 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (""CPS, the 
subsidiary, is a Delaware-based corporation, and Cummins, the parent, is an Indiana-based corporation. Because Plaintiff seeks 
to disregard the subsidiary's (CPS's) corporate form and hold the parent (Cummins) liable, Delaware law governs Plaintiff's veil-
piercing attack.""). The case cited by Plaintiffs is not dispositive—the court did not reach the issue of which state's law governs 
because it determined that the corporate veil was not pierced under either New York or Delaware law. See In re Digital Music 
Antitrust Litig., 812 F. Supp. 2d 390, 418 (S.D.N.Y. 2011) (""In determining whether to pierce the corporate veil in either state,

that the corporation is a mere sham acting for the shareholder, among others.""). "

1077,11, Formosa contests the characterization of the New Jersey offices as its headquarters. (Dkt. 101 at 11 n.10). 
1078,12," Plaintiffs also argue the Court has jurisdiction under the Clayton Act (Dkt. 109 at 16-19), but for the same reasons that it does 
not provide a basis for jurisdiction over Formosa, the Clayton Act does not provide a basis to assert personal jurisdiction over

primarily on its observation that [the subsidiary]'s services were 'important' to Daimler, as gauged by Daimler's hypothetical

foreign corporations to general jurisdiction whenever they have an in-state subsidiary or affiliate, an outcome that would sweep

choice, and the bargaining power to affect that choice, regarding what benchmark to select as part of the price equation. . . . The 
economic reality was that LIBOR benchmarks controlled approximately 75% of the global market for interest rate financial 
products during the relevant time period. Further, as a practical matter, some benchmark had to be used to estimate price. . . . 
Leading benchmarks, such as LIBOR, were used as a matter of course[,] not as a matter of choice."") (footnote and citations

1106,10," The Court observes that the third efficient enforcer factor may be in tension with traditional principles of notice pleading. In 
most areas of law, concerns about damage calculations are deferred until after the pleading stage. See Foster, Benchmark 
Manipulation Litigation at 142 (opining that the concern about speculative damages ""is not an efficient enforcer issue; rather, it is 
a problem of proof"")."
1106,11," The allegation that there are government investigations into Defendants' manipulation of the Fix price does not carry 
significant weight in the Court's analysis. Gelboim noted that there were government investigations related to the transactions at 
issue in that case ""ongoing in at least several countries."" 823 F.3d at 780. The Second Circuit observed that ""[s]ome of those 
government initiatives may seek damages on behalf of victims, and for apportionment among them"" but did not elaborate on how 
this should factor into its analysis beyond stating that it was ""wholly unclear on this record how issues of duplicate recovery and 
damage apportionment can be assessed."" Id. Plaintiffs have made similar allegations of government investigations into 
Defendants' conduct in this case. TAC ¶¶ 229-40. The importance of related government investigations in similar cases is 
unsettled in this district. Compare Sullivan, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25756, 2017 WL 685570, at *20 (""[A]ctions of government 
regulators lessen the need for plaintiffs to function as private attorneys general and vindicators of the public interest."") with In re

at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 20, 2016) (""Because public enforcement does not provide redress to victims of the conspiracy, the OTC 
Class is an efficient and necessary enforcer.""). In this case, the allegations that there are government investigations into the 
alleged manipulation of the Fix is not a significant factor in the Court's analysis. "
1107,12," See also id. at 216-17 (""To drive up the global price of an asset—such as silver—you have to buy a truly enormous amount. 
But you haven't gotten rich unless you can sell at the inflated price, and whatever forces raised the price while you bought will 
reverse when you try to sell. In theory, the plummeting price should precisely evaporate your profits. And in the meantime, you 
had to pay to transport and store a quarter of the world's silver."")."
1107,13," See also id. at 218 (""By their nature, benchmarks describe a market based on some small slice of it. Careful manipulators can 
bias that slice. It is daunting to corner the world currency market, but it is less daunting to comer the two percent of the market 
whose price is considered by the leading benchmark. By shrinking the domain over which the manipulator must exercise 
influence, benchmarks directly circumvent the principal challenges to manipulation identified by scholars."") (footnote omitted). "
1108,14," The question is not, as one commentator has argued, whether defendants are subject to ""ruinous liability"" or whether 
particular defendants are systemically important financial institutions. Foster, Benchmark Manipulation Litigation at 139-40. The 
Court agrees that there would be a ""serious rule of law problem"" if the efficient enforcer inquiry turned on whether a particular 
defendant was ""too big to fail."" Id. at 140; cf. Sharon E. Foster, Too Big to Prosecute: Collateral Consequences, Systemic 
Institutions and the Rule of Law, 34 Rev. Banking & Fin. L. 655, 674-85 (2015). Rather, the problem is whether defendants—no 
matter their size—are subject to liability that is disproportionate to their allegedly ill-gotten gains. This problem arises because of 
the structure of benchmark manipulation litigation and, more specifically, the problems of causal attenuation and complex 
damages apportionment noted above. "
1110,15," The Court does not hold that an allegation of market domination is the only method by which an exchange plaintiff can 
adequately plead antitrust standing in this context. For example, Defendants correctly note that the Exchange Plaintiffs have not 
""allege[d] that they traded through a clearing member affiliated with any Defendant."" Mem. at 12. The Court does not take a 
position on whether allegations of this type plausibly plead that a plaintiff is an efficient enforcer."
1110,16," The TAC is inconsistent with respect to whether platinum and palladium derivatives traded on NYMEX are directly pegged to, 
or merely strongly correlated with, the price of physical platinum and palladium. Compare TAC ¶ 207 (""The Defendants were 
also large participants in NYMEX futures and options. These contracts, like those for physical sales of platinum and palladium, 
directly incorporate or reference the Fix price in order to determine the cash flows between the parties."") with id. ¶ 91 (""The 
Fixing also directly impacts the price of NYMEX Platinum and Palladium. This is because exchange prices closely track the price 
of spot platinum or palladium."") (emphases added). Therefore, the Court interprets the TAC as alleging that some NYMEX 
derivatives directly reference the Fix price while others do not. HN23[
] With respect to derivatives that directly incorporate the 
Fix price, the antitrust injury inquiry is straightforward because ""[c]ourts in this Circuit consider manipulation of a price 
benchmark to constitute restraint of the market which that benchmark guides."" Oil, 256 F. Supp. 3d at 313 (citing Gelboim, 823 "
1111,," F.3d at 776-77; FOREX, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 128237, 2016 WL 5108131, at *6; Alaska Elec. Pension Fund v. Bank of Am. 
Corp. (""ISDAFix""), 175 F. Supp. 3d 44, 59 (S.D.N.Y. 2016)). With respect to derivatives that do not directly incorporate—but 
closely track—the Fix price, Plaintiffs have adequately alleged that Defendants' manipulation of the NYMEX market is 
""inextricably intertwined"" with their manipulation of the price for physical platinum and palladium. Aluminum II, 833 F.3d at 161. 
Plaintiffs have adequately alleged that Defendants profited by trading in the NYMEX market and that the manipulation of the 
physical prices of platinum and palladium—i.e., the prevailing price in the OTC market—was ""the very means"" by which 
Defendants profited in the NYMEX market. Id. at 162. Hence, the Exchange Plaintiffs have pleaded antitrust injury regardless of 
whether the derivatives they traded were directly linked to the Fix price. Gold reached a similar conclusion. 213 F. Supp. 3d at 
653 (holding that allegations that exchange plaintiffs suffered antitrust injury were ""inextricably intertwined"" with the Defendants' 
alleged manipulation of the Fix Price for antitrust standing purposes)."
1111,17," The Prime International Trading and Oil courts conducted their analyses of the markets in which the plaintiffs had alleged 
injury in the context of the antitrust injury prong of the antitrust standing analysis, rather than (as here) in the context of the 
efficient enforcer factors. But because the analysis of which market or markets in which the plaintiffs have alleged injury must be 
consistent across both prongs of the antitrust standing inquiry, both are persuasive for the Court's analysis."
1111,18," This analysis shows why Defendants' argument that the OTC Plaintiffs are ""more direct victim[s] of any alleged conspiracy to 
manipulate the"" Fixing than are the Exchange Plaintiffs is unconvincing. Mem. at 15. Plaintiffs have sufficiently pleaded antitrust 
injury in two different markets, so the OTC Plaintiffs are not more direct victims than the Exchange Plaintiffs; they are victims in a 
different market. Other judges in this district have also rejected the argument that participants in an OTC market are more direct 
victims of an alleged conspiracy than participants in an exchange market. See Nypl, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 122468, 2017 WL 
3309759, at *6 (""Contrary to Defendants' argument, FX spot market participants who transacted directly at spot trading prices 
are not more direct victims, but rather victims in a different market."") (citations omitted); FOREX, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 128237, 
2016 WL 5108131, at *11; cf. CHF LIBOR, 277 F. Supp. 3d at 561-62 (noting that ""[o]ne could . . . conceive of the Direct 
Transaction Plaintiffs as a 'more direct' victim than"" an exchange plaintiff but also observing that exchange plaintiffs' claim could 
proceed if they plausibly alleged market domination by defendants). Consequently, this argument is unconvincing. The Court observes a tension in both parties' arguments with respect to this issue. Plaintiffs assert that they have alleged ""a 
single market for platinum and palladium physical, futures and options transactions[.]"" Opp. at 15. This seems surprising 
because it supports Defendants' argument that the OTC plaintiff is a victim in the same market as the Exchange Plaintiffs. For 
their part, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs are ""asking the Court to hold Defendants trebly liable for transactions in 'two 
extraordinarily large' markets (futures and physical)[.]"" Mem. at 6 (quoting Platinum I, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46624, 2017 WL 
1169626, at *21) (emphasis added). This also seems surprising because it supports Plaintiffs' arguments that OTC plaintiffs are 
not efficient enforcers with respect to the NYMEX market. Hence, Plaintiffs and Defendants both appear to be arguing on the 
wrong side of the one-vs.-two markets question. This odd configuration likely arises because both Plaintiffs and Defendants had incentives to argue the opposite side of this 
question on the antitrust injury prong of the antitrust standing analysis. It is easier for Plaintiffs to show antitrust injury if they 
need only show such injury in one market; thus, Plaintiffs argued that physical and NYMEX platinum and palladium were traded 
in one market and Defendants argued that each set of Plaintiffs must demonstrate a distinct antitrust injury. Plaintiffs now argue 
that ""[w]hether physical and futures transactions represent one market or two markets is of no moment at this stage because the 
Court already ruled that Plaintiffs suffered antitrust injury."" Opp. at 15 (citing Platinum I, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46624, 2017 WL 
1169626, at *19-20). HN24[
] It is true that courts have generally addressed this issue on the antitrust injury prong of the 
antitrust standing analysis. See, e.g., Prime Int'l Trading, 784 F. App'x at 7. But as the above demonstrates, it is also relevant to 
the application of the efficient enforcer factors, including whether there are more direct victims of the alleged conspiracy under "
1112,," the second efficient enforcer factor. Furthermore, a definition of the relevant market is a prerequisite to the inquiry into whether 
defendants dominated a market."

1113,21," Defendants point to the TAC's allegation that ""'the autocatalyst and jewelry segments of the platinum market' are 'the two 
largest sources of demand'"" as further undercutting any suggestion that Defendants dominated the platinum and palladium 
market. Mem. at 13-14 (quoting TAC ¶ 78). However, as noted above, the Court has concluded that the OTC market and the 
exchange market are distinct, and this allegation pertains to the OTC market. "

1115,23," Because the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have made such a showing, it does not reach the question of whether personal

46624, 2017 WL 1169626, at *40-41. "
1118,24," Because Plaintiffs argued that conspiracy jurisdiction was proper under the New York long-arm statute, the Court offers an 
observation about the relationship between the requirements for conspiracy jurisdiction under that statute and the standard 
announced in Schwab. In its prior opinion, the Court held that ""[t]he elements of conspiracy jurisdiction [under the New York 
long-arm statute] are that '(a) the defendant had an awareness of the effects in New York of its activity; (b) the activity of the co-
conspirators in New York was to the benefit of the out-of-state conspirators; and (c) the co-conspirators acting in New York acted 
at the direction or under the control or at the request of or on behalf of the out-of-state defendant.'"" Platinum I, 2017 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 46624, 2017 WL 1169626, at *48 (quoting Tarsavage v. Citic Trust Co., 3 F. Supp. 3d 137, 147 (S.D.N.Y. 2014)). 
Although a defendant need not demonstrate a ""formal agency relationship . . . between coconspirators,"" the third prong of this 
test is designed to capture ""the traditional indicia of an agency relationship."" Contant v. Bank of Am. Corp., 385 F. Supp. 3d 
284, 292 n.2, 293 (S.D.N.Y. 2019). However, the Court recognizes that the requirements of conspiracy jurisdiction under New 
York law are unsettled. See id. at 292 n.2 (noting that ""an out-of-state defendant can be subject to personal jurisdiction in New 
York even without the traditional indicia of an agency relationship when that defendant 'has knowledge of the New York acts of "
1119,," his co-conspirators.'"" (quoting CPLR § 302 Practice Commentary C302:4 (2013) and citing Lawati v. Montague Morgan Slade 
Ltd., 102 A.D.3d 427, 961 N.Y.S.2d 5, 8 (1st Dep't 2013)). Still, the requirements for conspiracy jurisdiction announced in 
Schwab appear to be less demanding than those established under the New York long-arm statute. See In re LIBOR-Based Fin. 
Instruments Antitrust Litig. (""LIBOR VIII""), 11 MDL 2262 (NRB), 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 49700, 2019 WL 1331830 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 
25, 2019), at *11 (observing that ""any discussion of conspiracy jurisdiction must be approached with caution"" because ""the 
state[] in which . . . the FDIC bring[s its] state law claim[] [i.e., New York] . . . impose[s] more stringent requirements than the 
ones adopted by Schwab""). Conspiracy jurisdiction may thus be the rare issue where ""the jurisdictional analysis under the New 
York long-arm statute"" does not ""closely resemble the analysis under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment."" 
Licci, 673 F.3d at 61 n.11 (citation omitted). As noted above, because the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have adequately 
alleged the prerequisites for conspiracy jurisdiction with respect to the United States as a whole, it need not decide the 
relationship between the due process requirements for conspiracy jurisdiction and the requirements for conspiracy jurisdiction 
under the New York long-arm statute."
1119,25," California was ""the relevant forum for jurisdictional purposes"" in Schwab. 883 F.3d at 82 n.4."
1119,26," There is disagreement among district courts in this circuit over the precise holding of Schwab. The root of the disagreement 
centers on the motive of the conspiracy alleged in Schwab. In Gelboim—which involved the same conspiracy—the Second 
Circuit held that the allegations in that case ""evince[d] a common motive to conspire"" consisting of ""increased profits and the 
projection of financial soundness[.]"" 823 F.3d at 781-82 (quotation omitted). On remand, Judge Buchwald concluded that ""[i]t is 
far from clear that Gelboim should be read to mean that plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged 'increased profits' as a goal 
independent of a conspiracy to 'project[] . . . financial soundness."" LIBOR VI, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 175929, 2016 WL 7378980, 
at *2 (citation omitted). Therefore, the LIBOR VI court concluded that United States-based trading was not within the scope of 
the ""reputation-motivated,"" as opposed to a ""profit-motivated,"" conspiracy. 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 175929, [WL] at *8-9. This 
conclusion rested on the court's reasoning that a profit-motivated conspiracy was implausible because the LIBOR VI plaintiffs 
had alleged that the panel banks had colluded to suppress the LIBOR rate, but banks act as both borrowers and lenders. See 
2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 175929, [WL] at *2-6. Gelboim itself noted that ""common sense dictates that the Banks operated not just 
as borrowers but also as lenders in transactions that referenced LIBOR . . . It seems strange that this or that bank (or any bank) 
would conspire to gain, as a borrower, profits that would be offset by a parity of losses it would suffer as a lender"" before 
concluding that it could not come to a firm conclusion on the question because ""the record is undeveloped."" 823 F.3d at 783. 
Judge Buchwald found the record sufficiently developed to dismiss the claims of a profit-motivated conspiracy as implausible. 
LIBOR VI, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 175929, 2016 WL 7378980, at *3. Thus, Judge Buchwald concluded in LIBOR VIII that the 
allegation that Defendants had sold LIBOR-influenced securities in a forum was not an act ""in furtherance of the conspiracy"" 
because the sale of securities in the forum did not advance a reputation-motivated conspiracy. See 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
49700, 2019 WL 1331830, at *4 (""[T]he conspiracy to manipulate LIBOR had nothing to do with' defendants' transactions with 
plaintiffs, because the sale of LIBOR-based instruments motivated by defendants' 'financial self-interest' could not have furthered 
their conspiracy to manipulate LIBOR."" (quotation omitted)). The upshot of this reasoning is that if plaintiffs plausibly allege a 
profit-motivated conspiracy, then the mere sale of securities in a forum can constitute an act in furtherance of the conspiracy 
sufficient to confer jurisdiction. See FrontPoint Asian Event Driven Fund, L.P. v. Citibank, N.A., No. 16 Civ. 5263, 2018 U.S. Dist. "
1120,," LEXIS 171999, 2018 WL 4830087, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 4, 2018) (concluding that ""where the complaint plausibly alleges a profit-
motive, as here, the U.S.-based trading is properly alleged to have been a part of the conspiracy and to be related to the 
overseas . . . jurisdiction""). At least one court disagrees with this interpretation of Schwab, however. In Dennis, the plaintiffs argued that certain ""defendants 
marketed and sold BBSW-Based Derivatives in the United States."" 343 F. Supp. 3d at 203 (cleaned up). The plaintiffs 
contended that ""[t]hese transactions are sufficiently related to [their] claims . . . because they are the machinery through which 
Defendants committed a domestic per se antitrust violation by reaching into the forum to contract for price-fixed BBSW-Based 
Derivatives with U.S. investors."" Id. (cleaned up). The plaintiffs argued that ""the 'reputation-based' conspiracy alleged in Charles 
Schwab should be distinguished from the 'profit-motivated' conspiracy alleged here."" Id. at 205. However, Judge Kaplan noted 
that in Schwab ""the alleged conspiracy was undertaken both because 'by understating their true borrowing costs, Defendants 
were able to project an image of financial stability to investors who were sensitive to risks associated with major banks following 
the financial crisis that began in 2007' and because 'suppressing LIBOR . . . had the immediate effect of lowering Defendants' 
interest payment obligations on financial instruments tied to LIBOR."" Id. (quoting Schwab, 883 F.3d at 78) (emphasis in Dennis) 
(alterations omitted). ""Accordingly,"" the Dennis Court held, ""the conspiracy to manipulate LIBOR alleged in Charles Schwab was 
indeed motivated in part by financial incentives."" Id. And thus, Judge Kaplan held that Schwab ""controls here and precludes a 
finding of personal jurisdiction—whether through the Foreign Defendants' direct transactions in BBSW-Based Derivatives with 
plaintiffs or through a conspiracy theory of jurisdiction—over plaintiffs' federal claims on the basis of the Foreign Defendants' 
transactions in BBSW-Based Derivatives in the United States."" Id. at 205-06. Ultimately, as described at greater length below, 
the Court need not reach the issue of the precise holding of Schwab because the Court concludes that even if it defines 
Plaintiffs' alleged conspiracy narrowly—i.e., as a conspiracy to manipulate the Fix price—Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged in-
forum conduct in furtherance of the conspiracy."
1120,27," The TAC names BASF Corporation as a co-conspirator but not as a defendant. It does not name ICBC's U.S. based affiliate 
as a co-conspirator. However, because the complaint alleges that Defendant ICBC has ""New York-based precious metals 
traders,"" TAC ¶ 44, but ICBC has ""[n]o employees . . . permanently located in the United States,"" Florencio Decl. ¶ 9, the Court 
construes the TAC to allege that employees of a United-States-based affiliate of ICBC Standard employed precious metals 
traders."
1120,28," Consider the following hypothetical. Imagine that, hoping to earn profits by trading abroad, Bank A conspired to manipulate the 
Fix price in London with Bank B. Imagine also that, entirely unbeknownst to Bank A, Bank B received information about platinum 
trading from a United States branch of Bank C. Under the Schwab standard, a United States court may have personal 
jurisdiction over Bank A based on the transmission of information from Bank C to Bank B— even though Bank A is not alleged to "
1121,," have had any control over, or even to have known about, Bank C's communication. HN40[
] This hypothetical must be 
reconciled with the Supreme Court's admonition that the ""exercise of jurisdiction comports with due process only if the 
defendant's conduct and connection with the forum is 'such that the defendant should reasonably anticipate being haled into 
court there.'"" Contant, 385 F. Supp. 3d at 292 (quoting World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U.S. 286, 297, 100 S. 
Ct. 559, 62 L. Ed. 2d 490 (1980)). Judge Schofield has reasoned that the Schwab standard can be reconciled with the Supreme 
Court's case law on specific jurisdiction by noting that ""in any conspiracy, two or more entities that previously pursued their own 
interests separately are combining to act as one for their common benefit."" Id. at 293 (quoting Copperweld Corp. v. Indep. Tube 
Corp., 467 U.S. 752, 769, 104 S. Ct. 2731, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628 (1984)) (brackets omitted). In other words, two co-conspirators—
even co-conspirators who were unaware of the existence of the other—may be viewed as a single entity for purposes of 
conspiracy jurisdiction. "

] Although Plaintiffs' claim for principal-agent liability under the CEA does not expressly cite Section 22, both ""principal-agent liability and aiding and abetting claims under the CEA . . . are viable only where an underlying primary violation 
of the CEA can survive a motion to dismiss."" Sonterra Capital Master Fund, Ltd. v. Barclays Bank PLC, 366 F. Supp. 3d 516, 
554 (S.D.N.Y. 2018) (citations omitted). Accordingly, the viability principal-agent liability claim also depends on whether Plaintiffs 
have pleaded an appropriately domestic application of Section 22. "
1125,31," Because the Court concludes that Plaintiffs' Section 22 claims are predominately foreign, it does not decide whether Plaintiffs 
have pleaded an appropriately domestic application of other CEA provisions. "
1128,1," ESI and Hagan will sometimes be collectively referenced herein as the ""Employer-Plaintiffs."""
1128,2," The Employer-Plaintiffs have made hearsay and relevance objections to Defendants' Exhibit 2 under Federal Rules of 
Evidence 802, 401, and 403. (Dkt. #48 at 27). Defendants' Exhibit 2 consists of the Dallas City Council agenda and minutes from 
the meeting at which the Ordinance was passed. As this evidence does not support the Rule 12(b)(1) portion of the City's motion 
to dismiss, and the Court does not consider matters beyond the complaint in reviewing a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the Court 
did not consider Exhibit 2. See Baker v. Putnal, 75 F.3d 190, 196 (5th Cir. 1996) (""[T]he court may not look beyond the pleadings 
in ruling on [a Rule 12(b)(6)] motion.""). The Employer-Plaintiffs' objections to Exhibit 2 are, therefore, overruled as moot."
1128,3," The Employer-Plaintiffs make several objections in their reply to evidence Defendants offer in support of their response, 
including that such evidence is hearsay, unauthenticated, and irrelevant. (Dkt. #24). These objections are overruled. See Sierra 
Club, Lone Star Chapter v. F.D.I.C., 992 F.2d 545, 551 (5th Cir. 1993) (""[A]t the preliminary injunction stage, . . . the district court 
may rely on otherwise inadmissible evidence, including hearsay evidence.""); Fed. Sav. & Loan Ins. Corp. v. Dixon, 835 F.2d 554, 
558 (5th Cir. 1987) (citing Univ. of Tex. v. Camenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395, 101 S.Ct. 1830, 68 L.Ed.2d 175 (1981)) (""[A] 
preliminary injunction proceeding is not subject to jury trial procedures.""). In any event, the Court did not rely on the objected-to 
materials in reaching its decision."
1128,4," The Ordinance defines a ""medium or large employer"" as ""an employer with more than 15 employees at any time in the 
preceding 12 months, excluding the employer's family members."" Dall. City Code § 20-2(8). A ""small employer"" is ""any employer 
that is not a medium or large employer."" Id. § 20-2(11). "
1131,5," For the same reasons, Hagan's claims are also ripe for review. Unlike standing, the doctrine of ripeness does not speak to who 
may sue, but instead when a claim may be brought. Thomas v. Union Carbide Agr. Prods. Co., 473 U.S. 568, 580, 105 S.Ct. 
3325, 87 L.Ed.2d 409 (1985) (quoting Blanchette v. Conn. Gen. Ins. Corps., 419 U.S. 102, 140, 95 S.Ct. 335, 42 L.Ed.2d 320 
(1974)). ""Ripeness 'requir[es] us to evaluate both the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of 
withholding court consideration.'"" Texas v. United States, 523 U.S. 296, 300-01, 118 S.Ct. 1257, 140 L.Ed.2d 406 (1998) 
(quoting Abbott Labs. v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 149, 87 S.Ct. 1507, 18 L.Ed.2d 681 (1967)) (alteration in original). The City argues that Hagan will not suffer hardship if the issues are not adjudicated at this time because the Ordinance is not yet 
enforceable as to small employers. See Dall. City Code § 20-4(b). But ""[t]he Supreme Court has found hardship to inhere in legal 
harms,"" specifically, in the ""harm of being 'force[d] . . . to modify [one's] behavior in order to avoid future adverse 
consequences.'"" Texas v. United States, 497 F.3d 491, 499 (5th Cir. 2007) (quoting Ohio Forestry Ass'n v. Sierra Club, 523 U.S. 
726, 734, 118 S.Ct. 1665, 140 L.Ed.2d 921 (1998)) (alteration in original). Because Hagan has shown that it will imminently 
suffer harm by being forced to act in a financially detrimental way to become compliant with the Ordinance now, its claims are 
ripe for adjudication. "
1133,6," The City additionally argues that ""non-unionized employees suffer no loss of benefits and potentially have access to greater 
benefits under the Ordinance than employees subject to a collective bargaining agreement"" to demonstrate a lack of alignment 
with the Employer-Plaintiffs. (Dkt. #36 at 13). This argument misses the mark at the outset because the Employer-Plaintiffs' 
allegation—that their employees are harmed because the benefit of bargaining below the cap is denied to them unless they 
unionize—is entitled to a presumption of truth in the context of the City's facial attack on standing. The City's assertion may also 
be inaccurate. Although many employees will likely receive a benefit under the Ordinance that they would not have received "
1134,," otherwise, other employees may be losing a better or less restrictive benefit because their employer must provide sick leave 
time. "
1137,7," Although the Employer-Plaintiffs cite to Citizens United and Southwire Co. v. N.L.R.B., 383 F.2d 235, 240 (5th Cir. 1967), for 
the proposition that they possess a First Amendment right to refrain from operating as a unionized business, neither case 
specifically addresses an employer's right to unionize. See Citizens United, 558 U.S. at 342 (recognizing that ""First Amendment 
protections extend to corporations"" in a discussion of corporate political speech); Southwire Co., 383 F.2d at 240 (5th Cir. 1967) 
(discussing an employer's right to express an opinion regarding unionization rather than its right to unionize). "
1138,8," Sex or illegitimacy classifications are analyzed under intermediate scrutiny. See Clark v. Jeter, 486 U.S. 456, 461, 108 S.Ct. 
1910, 100 L.Ed.2d 465 (1988) (discrimination based on illegitimacy); Craig, 429 U.S. at 197 (discrimination based on sex). "
1140,9," As the Fifth Circuit has explained, consistent with Supreme Court precedent, ""Texas law contemplates the opportunity for 
precompliance review of an administrative subpoena before a neutral decisionmaker."" Cotropia, 721 F. App'x at 358 n.2. ""For 
example, Texas Occupations Code § 153.007(e) states that if 'a person fails to comply with a [Texas Medical Board] subpoena,' 
then [the Medical Board] 'may file suit to enforce the subpoena.'"" Id. (quoting TEX. OCC. CODE ANN. § 153.007(e)). As the 
Cotropia court observed, ""[i]n this scenario, a court can, prior to compliance, determine whether the subpoena is valid."" Id."
1140,10," Before issuing a subpoena, the City must ""seek the voluntary cooperation of any employer to timely obtain relevant information 
and testimony in connection with any investigation of a complaint filed under [the Ordinance]."" Dall. City Code § 20-10(b)."
1140,11," Section 2-9 provides little guidance on the nature of sanctions that may be imposed for, among other things, ""refus[ing] to be 
sworn,"" ""refus[ing] to appear to testify,"" or ""fail[ing] or refus[ing] to produce any book, paper, document or instrument touching 
any matter under examination"" by the City. Dall. City Code § 2-9. According to section 2-9, a person who runs afoul of its 
provisions is simply ""guilty of an offense."" Id."
1140,12, Corporation court is the municipal court. TEX. GOV'T CODE ANN. § 29.002. 
1141,13," Section 2-8 was made part of the Dallas City Code in 1941, while the Ordinance was passed in 2019. "
1143,14," A Texas state district court has also issued an order granting a motion temporarily enjoining the enforcement of a similar paid 
sick leave ordinance enacted in the City of San Antonio. (Dkt. #61-1) (Order on Temporary Injunction of the 408th Judicial 
District of Bexar County, Texas, in Associated Builders & Contractors of S. Tex., et al. v. City of San Antonio, et al., No. 
2019CI13921). Texas's Fourth Court Appeals has abated the appeal of that order pending the resolution of a petition for review 
before the Texas Supreme Court in the City of Austin case, suggesting that the Fourth Court of Appeals considers San Antonio's 
paid sick leave ordinance to be materially similar to the Austin paid sick leave ordinance enjoined in the City of Austin case. City 
of San Antonio v. Associated Builders & Contractors of S. Tex., No. 04-20-00004-CV, slip op., 2020 Tex. App. LEXIS 1972 (Tex. 
App.—San Antonio Mar. 4, 2020 no pet. h.) (mem op., not designated for publication). "
1145,15," Home-rule cities are those operating under a municipal charter as provided for in the Texas Constitution. Barnett v. City of 
Plainview, 848 S.W.2d 334, 337 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 1993, no pet.); TEX. CONST. art. XI, § 5. "
1146,16," The Austin court ruled on the matter as part of an appeal of a temporary injunction, which ordinarily would not include a ruling 
on the merits. See City of Austin, 565 S.W.3d at 438. However, the court stated that it ""must address the merits of the statutory-
preemption claim to determine whether the district court abused its discretion in denying the temporary injunction,"" as ""[t]hat is a 
legal question that the district court has no discretion to get wrong."" Id."
1146,17," As noted herein, see supra note 14, a state district court in San Antonio has also temporarily enjoined a substantially similar 
San Antonio city ordinance on the same preemption grounds. See Associated Builders & Contractors of S. Tex. v. City of San 
Antonio, No. 2019CI13921 (Bexar Cty. Dist. Ct.). However, that opinion does not provide reasoned grounds for the decision and 
is of limited usefulness in the analysis here."
1146,18," Generally, the FLSA applies to employers whose ""annual gross volume of sales made or business done"" is greater than $ 
500,000. See 29 U.S.C. § 206(a) (setting minimum wage for enterprises ""engage[d] in commerce""); id. § 203(s)(1)(A)(ii) (stating 
that an enterprise is ""engaged in commerce"" if its ""annual gross volume of sales made or business done"" is greater than $ 
500,000). "
1150,19," For example, in response to the rapid proliferation of COVID-19 in the United States, on March 18, 2020, Congress enacted, 
and the President signed into law, the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (""FFCRA""). Families First Coronavirus 
Response Act, Pub. L. No. 116-127, 134 Stat. 178 (2020). The FFCRA, which applies to private sector employers that employ 
fewer than 500 employees and some public sector employers, provides up to 80 hours of paid sick leave to workers who are ill, 
quarantined, or seeking treatment as a result of COVID-19, or caring for those who are sick or quarantined as a result of COVID-
19. These provisions will be in effect until December 31, 2020. Id. §§ 5102(a)-(b), 5108-09, 5110(2)(B). "
1163,1," As discussed in greater detail below, this test continued to evolve in the Sherman Act context to the point where in the Sixth 
Circuit, plaintiffs bringing § 1 Sherman Act claims must prove that a defendant's conduct unreasonably restrains trade under a 
rigid ""rule of reason"" burden-shifting framework that includes a five-part test. See Care Heating & Cooling, Inc. v. American 
Standard, Inc., 427 F.3d 1008, 1012 (6th Cir. 2005)."
1163,2," MCL § 445.766 provided: This act shall not apply to any contract mentioned in this act, nor in restraint of trade where the only object of restraint 
imposed by the contract is to protect the vendee, or transferee, of a trade pursuit, avocation, profession or business, or the 
good will thereof, sold and transferred for a valuable consideration in good faith, and without any intent to create, build up, 
establish or maintain a monopoly; nor to any contract of employment under which the employer furnishes or discloses to 
the employe[e] a list of customers or patrons, commonly called a route list, within certain territory in which such employe[e] 
is to work, in which contract the employe[e] agrees not to perform similar services in such territory for himself or another 
engaged in a like or competing line of business for a period of 90 days after the termination of such contract or services. "
1165,3," Defendants cite Bristol Window for the proposition that § 445.774a(1) is a codification of the rule of reason, ECF No. 400, 
PageID.24279, but that is not what Bristol Window nor Liquid Manufacturing stated. Rather, as the Michigan Court of Appeals 
made clear in St. Clair: ""§4a(1) represents a codification of the common-law rule 'that the enforceability of noncompetition 
agreements depends on their reasonableness.'"" St. Clair, 715 N.W.2d at 918. "
1166,4, The Board of Trade of Chicago excerpt quoted by Liquid Manufacturing is quoted above at page 16. 
1167,5," Plaintiffs rely on Little Caesar Enters., Inc. v. Creative Rest. Inc., No. 16-14263, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 174623, 2017 WL 
4778721 (E.D. Mich. Oct. 23, 2017), to argue that a full Sherman Act analysis should be applied when analyzing the breach of a 
business-to-business restrictive covenant. But that case involved trademark infringement, unfair competition, and trade dress "
1168,," infringement claims, not just a breach of contract action. And it neither applied all five Sherman Act factors nor did it clearly hold 
that all the Sherman Act factors must be met in a breach of contract action."
1168,6," The Court appreciates that both the Sixth Circuit and the Michigan Supreme Court in Liquid Manufacturing considered the 
Sherman Act concepts of per se violations and horizontal restraints on trade. See 912 F.3d at 340-41; 885 N.W.2d at 874. But 
while the Sixth Circuit and Michigan Supreme Court discussed these Sherman Act concepts, they did not expressly require that 
defendants challenging a noncompete agreement would necessarily need to prove all the elements of a § 1 Sherman Act claim. "
1169,7," As detailed above, the Seventh Circuit took a similar approach in County Materials for patent misuse cases. 502 F.3d at 736 
(stating that it is ""not necessary for a plaintiff to plead a case that would suffice to show that the antitrust laws have been 
violated. But, at the summary judgment stage, some evidence tending to show an adverse effect in an economically sound 
relevant market is essential for any claim governed by the rule of reason"") (emphasis added). "
1170,8," The details of this report are under seal. Further, this expert testified he was defining the relevant product markets strictly for 
purposes of damages calculations, which was a different consideration than defining product markets for purposes of an antitrust 
analysis."
1170,9," Notably, Realcomp II is a Sherman Act case, and it applies that rigid five-factor burden-shifting test developed in the Sixth 
Circuit under the Sherman Act. As explained above, in Liquid Manufacturing, the Michigan Supreme Court did not hold that the 
application of the rule of reason test would necessarily require proof of all the elements of a §1 Sherman Act claim, but it did cite 
to antitrust cases that have applied the rule of reason, indicating that the kinds of proof offered in such cases would be useful to 
parties attempting to show anticompetitive effects."
1170,10," For the same reasons, the Court will not conduct a ""quick look rule of reason"" analysis under the Sherman Act as NSL 
suggests. See ECF No. 415, PageID.26024. Not only is that a Sherman Act concept not applicable here, it is reserved for the 
situation where ""an observer with even a rudimentary understanding of economics could conclude that the arrangements in 
question would have an anticompetitive effect on customers and markets."" Cal. Dental Ass'n. v. FTC, 526 U.S. 756, 770, 119 S. 
Ct. 1604, 143 L. Ed. 2d 935 (1999). NSL has not shown this degree of anticompetitive effect to warrant any ""abbreviated"" rule of 
reason analysis. "
1171,11," Plaintiff contends that additional discovery is not appropriate because NSL initially brought an antitrust counterclaim and 
therefore had the opportunity to conduct such discovery. See Second Amended Counterclaim, ECF No. 188. First, that claim 
was dismissed because it was time barred. ECF No. 337. And more importantly, in light of this Court's decision to consolidate 
the Lead and Secondary Cases on Plaintiff's motion, and to reopen discovery once consolidation is complete, NSL and Lily 
should have the opportunity to conduct discovery on anticompetitive effects under the rule of reason. "
1172,12," Paragraphs 141 and 142 of the Complaint allege that ""[i]n April 2014, the NSL division ceased operations and all assets, 
including at least four of the accounts or agreements to produce the Secret Products, were transferred to LD Operating or LD 
Inc. and LD Operating began to produce and sell at least four of the Secret Products. . . . Such transfer occurred without any 
agreement or consideration."" No. 16-11179, ECF No. 1, PageID.31."
1172,13," The Complaint also alleges violations of other provisions of the Settlement Agreement. However, because this Court has 
already held—and the Sixth Circuit affirmed—that NSL is only bound by § 5.c of the Settlement Agreement by virtue of its 
incorporation into the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Court will only discuss those counts in the 16-11179 Complaint that assert 
violations relating to § 5.c. See 912 F.3d at 338-39; ECF No. 343 (Order on Motions for Summary Judgment disposing of counts 
II, IV, V, VII and VII in Lead Case)."
1172,14," It is unclear from Plaintiff's Complaint in Case No. 16-11179 whether Plaintiff is arguing that under the Michigan/Texas 
Fraudulent Transfer Act, it is able to recover for ""new"" breaches by Lily of the Desert (i.e., breaches that were not specifically 
made by NSL during the time frame that the parties' damages experts analyzed). "
1173,15," HN12[
] However, just because the Court at one time denied a plaintiff's motion to amend its complaint does not preclude a party from later moving to consolidate by invoking the Court's discretionary power to do so under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 
42(a)(2). This is not barred by the mandate rule because the district court is free on remand to consider issues remanded, issues 
arising for the first time after remand, and ""issues that were timely raised before the district and/or appellate courts but which 
remain undecided."" Wright & Miller Fed. Prac. & Proc. § 4478.3 (quoting United States v. Morris, 259 F.3d 894, 898-99 (7th Cir. 
2001)). "
1189,1," The Amended Complaints also allege various ""plus factors"" ostensibly supporting their allegations of unlawful anticompetitive 
conduct. See IPP Compl. ¶ 176; DPP Compl. ¶ 181. Because Plaintiffs plead direct evidence of agreements on AdBlue-related 
features, it is unnecessary to evaluate whether the plus factors, when combined with parallel conduct, would adequately allege 
the existence of such collusion. See B & R Supermarket, Inc. v. Visa, Inc., No. 16-01150 WHA, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 136204, 
2016 WL 5725010, at *6 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 30, 2016) (""An impermissible conspiracy can be alleged through either direct or 
circumstantial evidence.""). The plus factors' relevance vis a vis other alleged anticompetitive agreements is discussed below. "
1190,2," These requirements include showing either a per se Sherman Act violation or satisfying the rule of reason. See infra Section 
III.A.2."
1190,3, DPPs do not offer an independent argument for treating the AdBlue agreement as per se unlawful. See DPP Opp'n at 17-18. 
1193,4, Whether the steel-buying conspiracy can stand as its own Sherman Act violation is discussed below. 
1195,5," One arguable exception is DPPs' allegation that ""commonality of suppliers increased transparency into cost functions of each 
of the firms within the German Luxury Car Market, providing mechanisms to police the cartel."" DPP Compl. ¶ 185. Since this 
allegation goes to the ease of enforcing collusive agreements, rather than the extent to which a firm's pricing decisions will be 
driven by competitors' behavior, it may be distinguishable from allegations that the market is interdependent. However, by 
facilitating ""observation of their competitors' decisions,"" the alleged ""transparency"" would facilitate ""conscious parallelism"" by 
Defendants just as much as unlawful agreement. See In re Musical Instruments, 798 F.3d at 1195. This allegation, like others 
about Defendants' motive or ability to successfully collude, is equally consistent with lawful behavior as an anticompetitive 
conspiracy. "
1196,6," Because the Court has reviewed the press release's contents and finds it unhelpful, DPPs'request for judicial notice of this 
document is denied as moot. "
1197,7, VW's motion to file under seal (dkt. 412) is also granted. 
1208,1," Polaris requested permission to file a Daubert motion in connection with its class certification motion (ECF No. 321) and 
Plaintiffs did not object, except with respect to word limits in the briefing. (ECF No. 322.) The Court granted the request. (ECF 
No. 323.) Polaris then filed a motion for summary judgment. (ECF No. 356.) The Court heard oral argument on all motions 
together. "
1209,2," The Second Amended Complaint also includes Plaintiff Ronald Krans, a resident of Illinois. His claims have been dismissed 
from the case. (ECF No. 143.) "
1210,3," In In re St. Jude, the district court concluded that the consumer protection laws of 32 jurisdictions did not have outcome-
determinative conflicts with Minnesota. No. 01-CV-1396 (JRT/FLN), 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 74797, 2006 WL 2943154, at *5 & 
n.3 (D. Minn. Oct. 13, 2006), rev'd and remanded on other grounds, In re St. Jude Med., Inc. (""St. Jude II""), 522 F.3d 836 (8th 
Cir. 2008). That court relied on the plaintiffs' analysis to find no conflicts among certain state consumer protection laws, including 
the six states forming the basis of Plaintiffs' claims here. 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 74797, [WL] at *5. This Court has conducted its 
own analysis of the consumer statutes at issue and comes to a different conclusion based on the facts of this case."
1210,4," Polaris submitted a detailed table analyzing state consumer protection statutes in support of the argument that the laws conflict. 
(ECF No. 367-1 (""Polaris App. A"").) Plaintiffs respond with a much simpler table indicating ""yes"" or ""no"" to four questions about 
each state's consumer protection statute: whether a private cause of action exists, whether scienter is required, whether 
individual reliance is required, and whether material omissions are prohibited. (ECF No. 336-2 (""Pls' Tab C"").) These four issues 
were identified as outcome-determinative conflicts for the consumer protection statutes. In re St. Jude, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
74797, 2006 WL 2943154, at *5 n.4. Polaris argues that the states' consumer protection statutes also differ on the requirements 
of the duty to disclose omissions, materiality, and causation. Plaintiffs address these requirements in summary fashion, asserting 
that they are not outcome-determinative in the context of this case."
1210,5," The injury claimed by Plaintiffs is economic, not physical. "
1211,6," HN3[
] Special circumstances triggering a duty to disclose include: (a) one who speaks must say enough to prevent his words 
from misleading the other party; (b) one who has special knowledge of material facts to which the other party does not have 
access may have a duty to disclose these facts to the other party; and (c) one who stands in a confidential or fiduciary relation to 
the other party to a transaction must disclose material facts. Klein v. First Edina Nat'l Bank, 293 Minn. 418, 421, 196 N.W.2d 619 
(1972); see also Graphic Communs., 850 N.W.2d at 695-98 (citing Klein, 293 Minn. at 421). The parties do not dispute that

1212,7," The recent decision in State v. Minnesota School of Business does not address a defendant's ability to negate a plaintiff's direct 
or circumstantial showing of causation and reliance under the MCFA."
1212,8," In Curtis Lumber Co. v. Louisiana Pacific Corp., the Eighth Circuit considered several state consumer protection laws, including 
Minnesota's, in concluding that Arkansas's consumer protection statutes do not require proof of intent to deceive. 618 F.3d 762, 
778-79 (8th Cir. 2010). Like the MCFA, the terms of other state statutes ""require[] only that a violator intend for a purchaser to

474, 96 Ill. Dec. 418 (Ill. App. Ct. 1986)). Despite this statutory language, the court found that the consumer protection laws of 
other states, including Minnesota, do not require intent to deceive. See id. at 778 & n.12 (citing MCFA and McNamara v. 
Nomeco Bldg. Specialties, Inc., 26 F. Supp. 2d 1168, 1171 (D. Minn. 1998) (""Simply stated, one making representations in 
the sale of consumer goods can be held liable, even though he had no specific intent to falsely mislead the consumer."")). "
1213,9," More specifically, the Complaint alleges Polaris engaged in ""unlawful business acts and/or practices by not informing 
consumers that [its] Sportsman ATV could cause risks of product deformation and burns,"" (SAC ¶ 102), ""unfair business acts 
and practices"" by ""seeking to profit from selling ATVs that possess a latent defect,"" and ""fraudulent conduct"" based on ""fail[ing] 
to inform customers of exhaust heat defect."" (Id. ¶¶ 104, 105)."
1213,10," Plaintiffs have since abandoned their latent defect theory. Because the parties did not address the three prongs of the UCL in 
their briefing, it is not clear whether Plaintiffs have likewise abandoned their UCL unfairness claim. "
1215,11," At least one court has found that one of the unfair business practice claims under the CLRA has a scienter requirement. 
Mullins, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 79983, 2016 WL 3440600, at *6 (citing Cal. Civ. Code § 1770(a)(9) (prohibiting ""[a]dvertising 
goods or services with intent not to sell them as advertised."")). "
1216,12, Plaintiffs do not so limit any of their other state consumer protection claims. 
1219,13," See, e.g., Gold v. Lumber Liquidators, Inc., 323 F.R.D. 280, 290-91 (N.D. Cal. 2017) (not addressing conflicts of law; granting 
certification of multiple classes based on various consumer protection statutes, including a California class based on the UCL 
and CLRA, a class for violations of FDUTPA, and a class for violations of MCFA); In re Kind LLC ""Healthy & All Natural"" Litig., 
209 F. Supp. 3d 689, 697 & n.4 (S.D.N.Y. 2016) (providing little analysis of states' statutes, and not determining which, if any, 
state's consumer protection law would apply to a nationwide class.); Goldemberg, 317 F.R.D. at 386 (not addressing conflicts of 
law where plaintiffs moved to certify three classes based on products purchased in California, Florida, and New York); Khoday v.

(explaining that the court did not undertake a choice of law analysis because it found that choice-of-law clauses governed the 
defendants' contracts with the plaintiffs). "
1224,14," Polaris appears to recognize as much when distinguishing Plaintiffs' cited authorities. See Polaris Summ. J. Reply at 16 
(arguing Plaintiffs cannot rely on Carriuolo, 823 F.3d 977 in support of their Minnesota law arguments because it applies Florida 
law). "
1225,15," See also Koenig v. Boulder Brands, Inc., 995 F. Supp. 2d 274, 288 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (collecting cases); Ebin v. Kangadis Food 
Inc., No. 13 CIV. 2311 JSR, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26439, 2014 WL 737878, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 25, 2014) (denying summary 
judgment where plaintiffs had adduced evidence that they had overpaid because they paid the price of olive oil for pomace). "
1229,16," In its summary judgment briefing, Polaris argues that because Eichmann's model relies on averages, the Plaintiffs offer no 
evidence that can be used to prove the named Plaintiffs' individual damages. (See, e.g., Polaris Summ. J. Reply at 12 (arguing 
""average or 'normalized' data like Eichmann's cannot as a matter of law be used to prove individual (or, for that matter, class-
wide) damages"").) This is another attack on the assumptions underlying Eichmann's model and his subsequent calculation of an 
overcharge percentage attributable to the alleged defect—more ammunition for cross-examination. Polaris's cited authority 
stands for the uncontested proposition that ""[w]hether a representative sample may be used to establish class-wide liability will 
depend on the purpose for which the sample is being introduced and on the underlying cause of action."" Tyson Foods, Inc. v. 
Bouaphakeo, 136 S. Ct. 1036, 1049, 194 L. Ed. 2d 124 (2016). "
1230,17," The Court's acceptance or rejection of expert testimony to support individual damages does not inform the Court's decision on 
class certification. Though Butler and Eichmann are referred to as ""class-wide"" experts, this term was coined by Plaintiffs, who 
are moving for class certification. Butler and Eichmann simply analyze a large base of consumers and provide a model of 
damages that Plaintiffs wish to apply to their individual claims. In general, Butler and Eichmann attempt to capture shifts in the 
market that would affect the market equilibrium price at which Sportsman ATVs would have sold had Polaris disclosed their heat 
issues, and from there extrapolate the price premium attributable to the alleged exhaust heat defect. The Court thus uses the 
term ""market-based"" evidence, rather than ""class-wide"" evidence, particularly in view of its decision to deny class certification. "
1231,18," While repetitive, the Court discusses each named Plaintiff individually to emphasize that each Plaintiff's claims must be 
examined under the laws of his state of residence. "
1232,19," Polaris also argues that Johannessohn continued to drive his ATV after learning of the alleged exhaust heat defect, a fact 
which precludes him from demonstrating causation. See Polaris Summ. J. Reply at 18. This, too, raises an issue for a factfinder 
to decide. "
1233,20, The Court disregards any arguments raised by Polaris for the first time on reply. 
1235,21," Following the Zurn rule, a court in this District recently rejected two claims against Polaris for allegedly defective ATVs, 
concluding that the plaintiffs lacked standing to assert their claims because they did ""not allege, directly or by reasonable 
inference, that all of the vehicles that contain the defective engine necessarily overheat, catch fire, or otherwise malfunction."" In 
re Polaris Mktg., Sales Practices, & Prods. Liab. Litig., 364 F. Supp. 3d 976, 984 (D. Minn. 2019) (""Polaris Mktg. I"") (emphasis in 
original); see generally In re Polaris Mktg., Sales Practices, & Prods. Liab. Litig., No. 18-CV-0939 (WMW/DTS), 2020 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 32822, 2020 WL 919259, at *1 (D. Minn. Feb. 26, 2020) (""Polaris Mktg. II"")."
1235,22," Because, as Zurn notes, the standing issue is intertwined with an analysis on the merits, the manifest defect rule has also 
been analyzed under state law, as was the case in Briehl and O'Neil. Since the Eighth Circuit addresses this issue as one of 
constitutional standing, the Court does so as well. See, e.g., Penrod v. K&N Eng'g, Inc., No. 18-CV-02907 (ECT/LIB), 2020 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 8559, 2020 WL 264115, at *3 (D. Minn. Jan. 17, 2020) (""The law is clear in the Eighth Circuit that a federal court 
lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over absent class members' defective-product claims if there is no allegation that the product 
manifested the defect.""). "
1236,23," Plaintiffs presented a similar argument before Judge Schiltz in opposition to Polaris's motion to dismiss their amended 
complaint. Judge Schiltz rejected Polaris's argument that Plaintiffs lacked standing to represent class members who had 
purchased other Sportsman models or model years because Plaintiffs had ""adequately pleaded standing by alleging that the 
entire Sportsman line shares the same design defect—the routing of high-temperature exhaust next to the rider's leg and under 
the rider's seat."" (ECF No. 42 at 13.) This Court agrees that the Complaint on its face alleges a common design defect. But in 
response to Plaintiffs' motion for class certification, Polaris has presented evidence that the Class Vehicles differ significantly in 
their exhaust heat management—the issue at the very heart of Plaintiffs' case. As discussed further below, on this record the 
standing analysis therefore yields a different outcome."
1236,24," As noted above, the record indicates that mechanisms for heat management differ across the Class Vehicles. "
1237,25," Because the predominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(3) is more demanding than the commonality and typicality requirements 
of Rule 23(a), and all four requirements of Rule 23(a) must be satisfied for a proposed class to be certified, the Court need not 
address Rule 23(a) to rule on the Plaintiffs' motion for class certification. See Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 
117 S. Ct. 2231, 138 L. Ed. 2d 689 (1997) (""Even if Rule 23(a)'s commonality requirement may be satisfied by that shared 
experience, the predominance criterion is far more demanding.""); see, e.g., Avritt, 615 F.3d at 1029 (""Like the district court, we 
will assume that the Avritts could satisfy the prerequisites of Rule 23(a) and will focus our attention on their arguments that the 
class should be certified under Rule 23(b)(2) or 23(b)(3)."")"
1237,26," In the Order on Defendant's Motion to Dismiss, Judge Schiltz noted, ""The Court tends to agree with those courts that have 
found that, in the context of a putative class action, the question whether a named plaintiff may represent class members who 
purchased products that differed in some respect from the product purchased by the named plaintiff is not an issue of standing, 
but rather an issue to be resolved at the class-certification stage."" (ECF No. 42 at 12.) This Court, too, agrees that the challenge 
presented here—that of whether a named plaintiff may represent class members who purchased products different from the 
product purchased by the named plaintiff—is better suited for a predominance inquiry than a standing inquiry. The Court will 
therefore address both. "
1239,27," As to statewide classes, because of the Court's determination on predominance, the Court again does not reach the Rule 
23(a) factors. "
1243,1," The Court found that the Report and Recommendation contained certain information that qualified as confidential proprietary 
information or trade secrets under Seventh Circuit precedent (See Doc. 418); see also Learning Curve Toys, Inc. v. PlayWood 
Toys, Inc., 342 F.3d 714, 722 (7th Cir. 2003); Ball Mem'l Hosp., Inc. v. Mut. Hosp. Ins., Inc., 784 F.2d 1325 (7th Cir. 1986). The "
1244,," record contains both a sealed version (Doc. 402) and a public redacted version (Doc. 421). Throughout the ensuing Order, in the 
interest of brevity, the Court will simply cite to the public redacted version of this document rather than both, each time."
1244,2," Prior to docketing his formal Report and Recommendation, pursuant to the terms of appointment, the Special Master served a 
draft Report and Recommendation on the parties and allowed informal objections and proposed changes (See Doc. 391). The 
Special Master Williams refers to this informal objection process in his Report and Recommendation in footnotes 9, 11, 12, 13, 
15, and 17. See Doc. 421 at 20, 28, 30, 31, 34, and 35."
1244,3," On February 4, 2020, the Court provided a detailed analysis on the record regarding what information in the parties motions 
and exhibits qualified as confidential or proprietary information or trade secrets and could be appropriately redacted under 
Seventh Circuit precedent (Doc. 435); (see also Doc. 437 (transcript of Feb. 4, 2020 hearing)); see also Learning Curve Toys, 
Inc., 342 F.3d 714; Ball Mem'l Hosp., Inc., 784 F.2d 1325. The Court directed the parties to file final public redacted versions of 
its pleadings and exhibits in accord with the Court's rulings (Docs. 435, 437 (transcript), and 442). Throughout the ensuing 
Order, the Court will cite to the public redacted version of the pleadings and briefs."

1245,9," Today, the Court is entering three Orders (including this one) on three separate Reports and Recommendations prepared by 
the Special Master on certain motions filed by SIH. Each of SIH's motions and the accompanying Report and Recommendation 
warrants its own separate Order (See Docs. 451 (Memorandum and Order on Motion in Limine as to John Bowblis); 452 
(Memorandum and Order on the Motion in Limine as to John Meindl and Dennis Knobloch)). Nevertheless, the analysis of the 
issues contained in both this Order and the other two entered by the Court today is intertwined and all of the Orders must be 
viewed in tandem."
1245,10, Supra note 3.
1245,11, Id. 
1246,12, Supra note 1.
1246,13," Special Master Williams noted there is ""enough evidence in the record to create a triable issue of whether MHC was 
substantially foreclosed from the commercially insured outpatient surgical market."" (Doc. 421 at 24; see also Doc. 421 at 26, 28-
29)."
1246,14," More specifically, Special Master Williams highlights that MHC's main argument is that the exclusive contracts SIH entered 
into with payers created higher rates for payers in the Southern Illinois market than in other markets throughout the state (Doc 
421 at 29). But the Special Master found that the record does not clearly show the time period these numbers come from, so the 
link between the higher rates and SIH's exclusive contracts is not clear enough to create a triable issue to survive summary 
judgment. MHC cannot effectively argue that one can infer that SIH's actions caused market price increases (Doc. 421 at 29-30). 
Similarly, the Special Master notes there is no evidence in the record to show an actual injury to MHC itself. "
1247,15," MHC argues SIH's exclusive contracts ""forced [patients to] obtain outpatient surgeries at hospitals instead of less expensive 
ASCs (such as MHC in particular)."" (Doc 421 at 33). "
1248,16," As noted, neither party lodged a specific objection to the findings of fact made by Special Master Williams and the Court 
accordingly adopts the facts as stated herein. Even if a party had objected to the Special Master's factual findings, the Report 
and Recommendation contains a careful and meticulous factual background supported by the record and is not ""clearly 
incorrect."" In fact, the Special Master did a commendable job in his Report and Recommendation, distilling down and 
synthesizing the relevant facts in this highly complex and long running case."
1248,17," The relevant portions of the Report and Recommendation this Court is analyzing for purposes of its decision are the sections 
on antitrust injury, causation, and damages (Doc. 421 at 29-40)."
1248,18," Special Master Williams finds in the Report and Recommendation that MHC's damages theory is not tied to its claims, and 
MHC's expert does not make a reliable damages estimate (Doc. 421 at 37-38). MHC objects to this portion of the Report and 
Recommendation, arguing that an estimation is the only way to assess damages in the current case and its expert, Dr. Bowblis, 
made reasonable and reliable damages calculations (Doc. 446 at 17-20). The Court addresses these arguments in its separate 
Order on the Motion In Limine on the Testimony of Dr. Bowblis (Doc. 451). "
1249,19," HN3[
] ""[A]ntitrust analysis must sensitively recognize and reflect the distinctive economic and legal setting of the regulated 
industry to which it applies."" Concord v. Boston Edison Co., 915 F.2d 17, 22 (C.A.1 1990) (internal quotation marks omitted). SIH 
argued in its Motion for Summary Judgment that one Seventh Circuit Case, Methodist II, is analogous here. As Special Master 
Williams recommended, SIH's arguments supported by Methodist II are compelling because the facts of Methodist II and our 
present case are so similar. This Court's analysis demonstrates that Methodist II is highly instructive. "
1250,20," The Court is not addressing this issue at length in the body of this Order because it is unnecessary for the analysis, given that 
it is clear MHC cannot demonstrate key elements of antitrust injury, causation, and damages, which warrants summary 
judgment."
1250,21, See Infra p.17-28 
1251,22," HN9[
] If lawful competition ""fully accounts for"" a plaintiff's ""claimed injury,"" the law will ""deny any injury"" because ""the 
plaintiff's situation would be the same with or without the challenged restraint."" Areeda & Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law ¶ 338b-c. "
1253,23," MHC outlines the five issues as follows: ""a) Under Methodist II, Defendant's contracts with BCBS and HA are legal because 
they were not ""exclusive,"" because (1) their members always could seek treatment at other providers, whether contracted or not, 
including MHC, and (2) MHC could compete for its own contracts due to the short duration of SIH's; b) MHC was not 'foreclosed' 
or excluded from competing for outpatient surgery patients; c) MHC's tying claim fails because (1) there was not 'tie' as payers 
never ask to contract for a hospital's inpatient and outpatient services separately, and (2) payers testified they agreed willingly to 
the provisions; d) MHC's monopolization claim fails because (1) MHC has not been excluded from referral sources, (2) MHC 
makes no attempt to define the proper universe of 'market' to know what allegedly was monopolized, (3) MHC offers no 
damages at all for it monopolization claim; and e) MHC's claims in whole fail because (1) it cannot show higher prices (and thus 
competition was not harmed), and (2) it cannot establish the essential elements of causation or (3) damages for any of its claims 
(Doc. 439 at 2-3; Doc 446 at 8)."
1253,24," Both SIH and the Special Master correctly specify the parts of the record in which SIH repeatedly made this argument (See 
Doc. 432 at 4) (citing Resp. to Mot. To Supp. (Doc. 410) at 8-10 (listing 15 bullet points where this argument appeared)); see 
also Doc. 421 at 35 n.17 (stating that SIH raised this argument in 'over six pages' of its Motion for Summary Judgment alone). "
1254,25," The Court has carefully considered all of the arguments raised by the parties and all of the objections to the Report and 
Recommendation. But this was no easy task. MHC frequently conflated arguments made by SIH and findings made by the 
Special Master, making it difficult to parse the issues out in an organized fashion. The Court has spent an extensive amount of 
time analyzing and giving fresh consideration to all of the issues in this case. Nevertheless, if there is any argument or objection 
raised by MHC that is not specifically addressed by this Memorandum and Order, the Court can confidently say that it 
considered it and has rejected it. "
1255,26," In fact, MHC admits it cannot prevail on its monopolization claims without proof of its exclusive dealing or tying claims (Doc. 
421 at 39). "
1258,1," Similar confusion seems to have arisen regarding Fareportal's various affirmative defenses, which Fareportal briefly referenced 
collectively to underscore the overall theme that Jacobs has spent more efforts to offer a website that looks like Fareportal's 
CheapOair brand than he has in trying to develop his later-created travel referral site under his claimed ""Cheapo"" brand 
independently. See Doc. 183 at 55. Jacobs did not move to strike Fareportal's affirmative defenses, but the Court appears to 
have done so as to the mitigation defense, adopting Jacobs' misconstruction of the defense. Order at 36; Doc. No. 197 (Jacobs 
Opp.) at 127; compare Doc. No. 54 (Answer) at 14 (""Plaintiff has suffered no damages, and even if he did, he failed to mitigate 
them.""). However, as the pleading makes clear, the defense is directed at damages. See id.; see also Bauer Bros., LLC v. Nike, 
Inc., 159 F. Supp. 3d 1202, 1215 (S.D. Cal. 2016); accord Hokto Kinoko Co. v. Concord Farms, Inc., 810 F. Supp. 2d 1013, 
1039 (C.D. Cal. 2011) (declining to address the defendant's failure to mitigate defense on summary judgment because it is 
""pertinent only to the issue of damages and [is] not [a] defense[] to Plaintiff's claims for trademark infringement and unfair 
competition""). The Court's Order remains unclear about whether its dismissal of the defense is as to liability only (as to which the 
defense was not asserted), or for all purposes (i.e., including with respect to damages). Particularly as the parties are in the 
damages phase of the case, Fareportal submits that clarification on this ground may prevent confusion and objections among 
the parties regarding the taking of discovery on this point."
1258,2," The Federal Trade Commission has recently weighed in on keyword bidding, taking the issue that even bidding on a 
competitor's name (to say nothing of a variation of one's own name) is necessary for consumer choice, and thus restrictions on "
1259,," keyword bidding violate antitrust law. See 1-800 Contacts Inc. v. Federal Trade Commission, No. 18-3848 (2d Cir.). Therefore, 
the keyword bidding question has implications well beyond the scope of this proceeding, which may also affect the parties' trial 
preparation. To the extent this issue is no longer in the case, efficiency would be greatly increased for this reason as well."
1259,3," Under the cited provision, a mark may become generic (as have once-registered brand names like ""aspirin,"" ""trampoline,"" 
""cellophane,"" ""zipper,"" and ""escalator""), but it can never be challenged as descriptive of the goods or services associated 
therewith. See id. "

1281,11," There is one limited exception to the Court's characterization of Homebuilder Plaintiffs as indirect purchasers. Two of the 
Homebuilder Plaintiffs, Ashton Woods and D.R. Horton, seek damages from L&W directly. These direct purchaser claims for 
damages are asserted under federal law. Pursuant to the Court's September 27, 2019 Order, (ECF 413), Homebuilder Plaintiffs 
submitted documentary evidence indicating that these Plaintiffs purchased directly from L&W, (ECF 417 at 4.) "
1282,12," Defendants do not make a Daubert challenge to the admissibility of the opinion of Homebuilder Plaintiffs' expert Dr. Wilde. 
Homebuilder Plaintiffs explained that they ""only provided an expert report addressing downstream pass-through out of an 
abundance of caution so as to avoid being precluded from doing so in the unlikely event the Court at a later date determines that 
a pass through defense is available."" (ECF 315 at 5 n.3.)"

Motion to Preclude Dr. Robert Willig. The Willig II Report, which is filed under seal, is available at pp.22-130 of ECF 413. "
1284,16," The Fact of Injury (""FoI"") Report, dated December 22, 2017, is available at Exhibit 4 to Defendants' Memorandum in Support 
of their Motion to Preclude Dr. Daniel Ingberman. The FoI Report, which is filed under seal, is available at ECF 323-4."
1284,17," The Amount of Damages (""AoD"") Report, dated January 26, 2018, is available at Exhibit 5 to Defendants' Memorandum in 
Support of their Motion to Preclude Dr. Daniel Ingberman. The AoD Report, which is filed under seal, is available at ECF 323-5. "
1285,18," Homebuilder Plaintiffs' Motion to Preclude the Testimony of Defendants' Expert, David Hall is filed at ECF 321. The sealed 
Memorandum in Support of the Motion is filed at ECF 315. The Court will hereafter refer to Homebuilder Plaintiffs' Memorandum 
as ""Mot. re Hall."" "
1287,19," The Court permitted the parties to submit separate supplemental briefing on the availability of the pass-through defense 
following oral argument on the Daubert motions, which resolved these timeliness objections. As discussed in subsection VI.A., 
the legal availability of a defense based on pass through is dispositive to Homebuilder Plaintiffs' Motion challenging the 
admissibility of Hall's testimony."
1287,20," Homebuilder Plaintiffs' Motion to Preclude the Testimony of Defendants' Expert, Dr. Robert Willig is filed at ECF 320. The 
sealed Memorandum in Support of the Motion is filed at ECF 314. The Court will hereafter refer to Homebuilder Plaintiffs' 
Memorandum as ""Mot. re Willig."""
1287,21," Aside from their dispute as to the admissibility of the forecasting model, the parties dispute what the purported inadmissibility 
of the forecasting model would mean for the rest of Dr. Willig's testimony. Homebuilder Plaintiffs insist that the forecasting model 
is intertwined with the entire February 26 report such that the forecasting model cannot be excluded without excluding the entire 
report. Defendants respond that the forecasting model is a limited portion of the report, and the effect of its inclusion could be 
cabined. Because the forecasting model is admissible, it is not necessary to reach this issue."
1287,22," Cointegration is a characteristic some nonstationary datasets have that allows analysts to use ordinary least squares 
regressions without using other corrective techniques to address the nonstationarity. Nonstationary data is data whose underlying properties change over time. (Id. at 5.) For example, many facts about the drywall 
market might change with overall national economic conditions; the drywall market is therefore nonstationary with respect to 
national economic conditions. Typically, an analyst working with nonstationary data must use one of several analytical 
techniques to control for nonstationarity. (Id.) There is no dispute that Dr. Willig's data are nonstationary. (Id.) "
1288,," However, certain nonstationary datasets are cointegrated. Cointegration means that the data respond similarly enough to the 
source of nonstationarity that the nonstationarity does not ultimately undermine the regression. (Id. at 5-6.) Homebuilder 
Plaintiffs borrow the example of ""a drunkard and her leashed dog walking on the street. The drunkard's path may resemble a 
random walk (and therefore appear to be nonstationary) and so does the path of her dog. But, because they are walking forward 
together and in more or less the same direction, they will not 'deviate' too far from one another and their paths can therefore be 
considered cointegrated."" (Id. at 6.)"
1288,23," Homebuilder Plaintiffs do not define codependency. Per Defendants' opposition brief, ""In the context of the regressions in this 
case, which use data at the state-month level to regress price on supply and demand factors, cross-sectional dependence 
[codependency] could, but does not necessarily, arise if the unexplained portion of prices are correlated across states."" (Opp'n 
re Willig at 8 n.4.)"
1288,24," ""Absent a stipulation or court order, the disclosures must be made: . . . (ii) if the evidence is intended solely to contradict or 
rebut evidence on the same subject matter identified by another party under Rule 26(a)(2)(B) or (C), within 30 days after the 
other party's disclosure."" Although this material was disclosed more than thirty days after Dr. Ingberman's critique was revealed, 
""both parties' experts disclosed additional work they had done in response to the opposing expert's opinions on the date of their 
depositions."" (Opp'n re Willig at 12.) "
1289,25," Defendants' Motion to Preclude the Testimony of Homebuilder Plaintiffs' Expert, Dr. Daniel Ingberman is filed at ECF 319. The 
sealed Memorandum in Support of the Motion is filed at ECF 323. The Court will hereafter refer to Homebuilder Plaintiffs' 
Memorandum as ""Mot. re Ingberman."" "
1293,26," Because ""[i]t is well established that a trial judge possesses the discretion to prohibit parties from raising matters they have 
failed to advance during the pretrial proceedings,"" the trial court also has the discretion to consider arguments that were 
preserved but not actively litigated. Sample v. Diecks, 885 F.2d 1099, 1106 (3d Cir. 1989). This Court exercises that discretion 
here because both parties had the opportunity to set forth their substantive arguments regarding the availability of the pass-
through defense. "
1295,27," Defendants reference Elite Logistics Corp. v. MOL America, Inc., No. 11-2952, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13019, 2016 WL 
409650 (C.D. Cal. Feb. 2, 2016). In that case, the court was ""not persuaded by [the] suggestion that the Kwikset court imposed a 
general bar on pass-on defenses, or even a bar in all UCL cases."" 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13019, [WL] at *3. But in a previous 
opinion in that case, the Elite court cited Kwikset for the proposition that ""the California Supreme Court has rejected such ... 
'pass-on' defenses, even outside the antitrust context."" Elite Logistics Corp. v. MOL Am., Inc., No. 11-2952, 2013 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 124109, 2013 WL 4601237, at *4 (C.D. Cal. Aug. 29, 2013). The Court agrees with the first conclusion reached by Judge 
Pregerson in Elite."
1295,28," As noted, Clayworth recognized two exceptions to the general rule of unavailability. Homebuilder Plaintiffs argue that it is 
undisputed neither exception is implicated here. (Pls.' Supp. Mem. at 4; Pls.' Supp. Mem. re Pass Through at 8.) Defendants do 
not agree or disagree, nor do they offer arguments under either exception. "
1296,29," Although Homebuilder Plaintiffs briefly complained of the timing of the Westerlund analysis at oral argument, Hr'g Tr. 76:21-
77:1, neither Homebuilder Plaintiffs' reply brief nor their post-hearing supplemental briefing addresses the timeliness of the 
Westerlund analysis. The Court concludes that it is timely rebuttal testimony under Rule 26(a)(2)(D)(ii), as is Dr. Ingberman's 
attack on the Kao and Pedroni tests at his deposition. "
1297,30," Defendants have asserted that the drywall purchased always shows the identity of the manufacturer. This is a disputed factual 
issue for trial. For purposes of this Motion, the Court assumes Homebuilder Plaintiffs were unaware of the manufacturer of their 
drywall purchases."
1297,31," The Umbrella Damages Opinion may allow Homebuilder Plaintiffs to proceed without identifying the specific manufacturer 
from whom they purchased. Under an umbrella damages theory, as applied to proof of damages, each Homebuilder Plaintiff can 
prove damages based on its overall purchases of drywall, without regard to the identity of the manufacturer, if the evidence 
shows that the nonconspiring manufacturers raised their prices because of the price-fixing conspiracy. Mid-West Paper Products 
Co. v. Continental Group, Inc., 596 F.2d 573, 584 n.45 (3d Cir. 1979)."
1297,32," Those Defendants who have already settled, of course, cannot be held liable at the upcoming Homebuilder Plaintiffs' trial. 
However, the prices they charge for drywall may be admissible at trial. "
1316,1," ""Citations to the trial transcript are in the form: ""([Witness last name] Tr. [page])."" "
1317,2," It should be understood that the Court is issuing this Opinion in the midst of the global coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. As 
readers today (i.e., April 2020) well understand, we are living through a national emergency, in which courtrooms (although not 
Courts) are largely closed, and most people (including judges, law clerks, lawyers, and assistants) are working remotely from 
home. As of this writing, it is generally known and can be accurately and readily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot 
reasonably be questioned, that the travel industry, and particularly air travel, has been hit particularly hard by the virus. See, 
e.g., U.S. Department of the Treasury, Procedures and Minimum Requirements for Loans to Air Carriers. . . under. the 
Coronavirus 
Aid, 
Relief 
and 
Economic 
Security 
Act

(last 
accessed April 7, 2020); Tr. Mar. 30, 2020 teleconference at 4-5; see generally Fed. R. Civ. P. 201. Understandably, however, 
no evidence was presented at trial about the impact of the coronavirus, or how its devastation might itself transform the air travel 
industry. Therefore, and necessarily, the Court has not considered the potential consequences of the virus in making its findings 
of fact or conclusions of law. To be clear, the Court's forward-looking analysis does not (and cannot) take into account the 
current crisis caused by the pandemic."
1317,3," All witnesses testified live at trial, unless otherwise noted. "
1318,4, See Carter Tr. 289. 
1319,5," The specific numbers in this paragraph do not appear in the trial transcript; they were shown on Dr. Murphy's Demonstrative 
slide number 7, which was marked confidential at trial, and therefore alluded to but not discussed specifically in open Court. 
Instead, counsel, the witness, and the Court looked at their own copies of the demonstrative while the witness testified. Although 
the demonstrative was not admitted into evidence, the Court does not understand there to be a dispute about the specific 
percentages recited in this paragraph. If there is a dispute, it is not material to any issue in this case."
1319,6," An important but confusing fact in this case is that a ""direct connect"" is part of the indirect channel of distribution, as it refers to 
a direct connection between an airline and a travel agency. "
1320,7," The two Murphy Demonstrative slides relied on in this paragraph were not admitted into evidence, but the Court understands 
the data reported here are not in dispute. Any dispute on these points is not material to any issue in this case. "
1322,8," See also US Airways, Inc. v. Sabre Holdings Corp., 938 F.3d 43, 58 (2d Cir. 2019). "
1325,9," A travel agency can access content from an airline's direct connect via a Farelogix proprietary user interface, known as SPRK, 
or the agency's own aggregation platform. (PX025 at -952; Reiz Tr. 1349-50; see also Gamer Tr. 99-100) "
1337,10," Dr. Murphy, like Dr. Nevo, has impressive and pertinent qualifications. Dr. Murphy received his Ph.D. in economics from the 
University of Chicago, has published articles in around 70 journals, and has received both the John Bates Clerk medal and the 
MacArthur fellowship. (Murphy Tr. 1415-18) "
1338,11," Dr. Nevo's market share calculations in the TTA market included bookings made through Southwest's ""self-build"" API. (Nevo 
Tr. 921). Because Southwest does not compete to provide ""booking services"" for other airlines, its inclusion in these calculations 
is conservative, as it makes the reported market shares lower than they would otherwise be. (Nevo Tr. 921-22) Some of specific data cited in this paragraph do not actually appear in the trial record, as neither Dr. Nevo nor Dr. Murphy 
expressly stated all the numbers during their testimony and their demonstratives were not admitted into evidence. The relevant 
numbers and calculations appear in the expert reports (which were also not admitted). The Court understands there to be no 
dispute between the parties as to how Dr. Nevo calculated his HIE numbers or the resulting numbers if the adjustments 
suggested by Dr. Murphy are made. While the parties disagree about the import of the HHI analyses, and whether Dr. Nevo's or 
Dr. Murphy's analysis is more pertinent, they do not disagree as to what figures result from each expert's inputs. "
1339,12," These specific figures are not in the trial record, but they are in Murphy's expert report. As with other data described above, 
the Court understands the parties to be in agreement as to these numbers but not as to their relevance and import. "
1342,13," Shortly after the acquisition was announced, a senior Delta executive told his CEO that [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] 
see also Adair Tr. 1720-21 (Farelogix is ""an airline-centric entity"" that ""think[s] about how airlines want to solve the problems"")) "
1346,14," As best as the Court can tell, the Third Circuit has not yet had occasion to consider Amex."
1346,15," See also United States v. Grinnell Corp., 384 U.S. 563, 86 S. Ct. 1698, 1705, 16 L. Ed. 2d 778 (1966) (""We see no reason to 
differentiate between 'line' of commerce in the context of the Clayton Act and 'part' of commerce for purposes of the Sherman 
Act.""); Hornsby Oil Co. v. Champion Spark Plug Co., 714 F.2d 1384, 1393 n.9 (5th Cir. 1983); Kellam Energy, Inc. v. Duncan, 
616 F. Supp. 215, 218 n.3 (D.Del. 1985). "
1347,16," The Court does so for multiple reasons, including the present lack of guidance from the Third Circuit on applying Amex, the 
possibility of appellate review in this case, the expedited nature of this litigation, and the enormous resources the parties and the 
Court have devoted to this case. Additionally, as is clear from the findings of fact, the Court has found as a matter of real-world 
economic reality that Sabre and Farelogix do compete to a certain extent, so resting a decision in this case entirely on a 
determination of law that Sabre and Farelogix cannot compete in a relevant market is not a comfortable result. Further, the US 
Airways decision was issued after the government filed this case, so it also does not seem right to summarily terminate DOJ's 
case based on a non-binding subsequent decision from an appellate court in a case in which the government was not even 
involved. "
1348,17," An analogy can be made to tying cases, in which a plaintiff must prove ""an agreement by a party to sell one product [or 
service] but only on the condition that the buyer also purchases a different (or tied) product [or service]."" Avaya, Inc., RP v. 
Telecom Labs, Inc., 838 F. 3d 354, 394 (3d Cir. 2016). In these cases, ""the answer to the question whether one or two products 
are involved turns not on the functional relation between them, but rather on the character of the demand for the two items."" 
Jefferson Parish Hosp. Dist. No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 19, 104 S. Ct. 1551, 80 L. Ed. 2d 2 (1984), partially abrogated on other 
grounds by Illinois Tool Works, Inc. v. Independent Ink, Inc., 547 U.S. 28, 126 S. Ct. 1281, 164 L. Ed. 2d 26 (2006). Thus, ""to 
identify a distinct product market"" for a service that is included in a larger ""package"" of services, a plaintiff must show ""sufficient 
demand for the purchase of [that] service[] separate from [the package]."" Id (emphasis added); see also Avaya, 838 F.3d at 397; 
Collins v. Associated Pathologists, Ltd., 844 F.2d 473, 477-78 (7th Cir. 1988) (holding that because ""no separate demand exists 
for pathological services that is sufficient to create a separate market [from hospital services],"" pathological and hospital services 
""combine in the form of one product, not two tied products""). "
1349,18," Likewise, while DOJ attempts to show ""distinct demand for booking services and aggregation services"" by suggesting that 
Farelogix and Travelfusion offer these services on a standalone basis (see D.I. 241 at 3), this evidence does not demonstrate 
that Sabre offers these products on a standalone basis; nor does it establish that Sabre participates in these product 
""submarkets."" "
1350,19," It is not as clear whether airline.com must be included in the ""TTA booking services"" market. TTAs primarily serve business 
travelers and offer specific support services that these travelers request, which are not available from airline.com. (Radcliffe Tr. 
172-73, 335; Ekert Tr. 1184) There is also a lack of evidence that airlines view TTAs as an alternative to airline.com or that 
airline.com exerts competitive pressure on TTAs. It may be, then, that DOJ's TTA market analysis is somewhat less flawed than 
its OTA market analysis."
1350,20," The Court agrees with Defendants that, to the extent DOJ is now inviting the Court to ""unilaterally change the defective market 
allegations if necessary to save its case,"" it would be wrong for the Court to do so under the circumstances here, which include 
that both parties (and the Court) have already devoted enormous resources to the case the government chose to bring. (D.I. 235 
at 2; see also id. at 18-20; D.I. 242 at 2 n.3; see generally D.I. 233 at 30 n.6 (DOJ: ""The Court is not limited to considering the 
markets that the Government alleged; if the Court finds harm in any relevant market based on the evidence presented, the Court 
may find a Section 7 violation."")) "
1354,21," Because DOJ failed to prove a relevant market, the Court need not and will not address Dr. Nevo's SSNIP analysis in any 
greater detail than it already has elsewhere in this Opinion. "
1368,1," The briefing and other filings related to the pending motion can be found at D.I. 291, D.I. 292, D.I. 302, D.I. 303, D.I. 304, and 
D.I. 306."
1368,2," An AB-rated drug is a generic drug certified by the FDA to be bioequivalent to the branded drug, and it must have the same 
form, dosage, and strength as the branded drug. See Abbott Labs. v. Teva Pharms. USA, Inc., 432 F. Supp. 2d 408, 415 (D. 
Del. 2006). In contrast, an authorized generic drug is a branded drug that is marketed, sold, and distributed ""under a different 
labeling, packaging, . . . product code, labeler code, trade name, or trade mark than the listed drug."" 21 U.S.C. § 355(t)(3)(B); 
see also In re Zetia (Ezetimibe) Antitrust Litig., 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 59469, 2019 WL 1397228, at *14 (E.D. Va. Feb. 6, 2019), 
report and recommendation adopted, 400 F. Supp. 3d 418 (E.D. Va. 2019) (explaining that authorized generic drugs are 
approved under the brand's NDA, whereas AB-rated generic drugs are approved under a competitor's separate ANDA). The 
180-day generic exclusivity period awarded to the first ANDA filer under the Hatch-Waxman Act does not prevent a brand 
manufacturer from launching an authorized generic product or licensing its product to another company to sell an authorized 
generic to compete with the ANDA product during the exclusivity period. See 21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(5)(B)(iv); In re Loestrin 24 Fe 
Antitrust Litig., 814 F.3d 538, 543 (1st Cir. 2016) (""[T]he generic manufacturer may still face competition from a generic version 
of the drug produced by the brand manufacturer, also known as an authorized generic ('AG'), at any time, including during the 
exclusivity period.""). "
1371,3," Currax addressed the Third Circuit's decision in King Drug Co. in its briefing as follows: ""The Third Circuit found that a 
settlement agreement in which a generic manufacturer is awarded an exclusive license to launch an authorized generic product 
functions as an illegal reverse payment—withholding valid competition to delay generic entry."" (D.I. 302 at 11) This statement is 
inaccurate. First, the Third Circuit did not find the no-AG term to be an illegal reverse payment under the antitrust laws. Instead, 
the Third Circuit held that the pleading adequately alleged facts to support the survival of the allegation at the pleading stage. 
King Drug Co., 791 F.3d at 409 (""We believe plaintiffs' allegations, and the plausible inferences that can be drawn from them, 
are sufficient to state a rule-of-reason claim under Twombly and Iqbal on the ground that GSK sought to induce Teva to delay its 
entry into the lamotrigine tablet market by way of an unjustified no-AG agreement.""). Second, the no-AG provision in the 
settlement agreement authorized Teva to launch a generic, as opposed to an authorized generic as suggested by Currax—the 
purpose of the no-AG clause was to prohibit the launch of an authorized generic during Teva's 180 days of generic exclusivity. 
Id. at 393-94 (""They agreed Teva would end its challenge to GSK's patent in exchange for early entry into the $50 million annual 
lamotrigine chewables market and GSK's commitment not to produce its own, 'authorized generic' version of Lamictal tablets for 
the market alleged to be worth $2 billion annually.""). Third, although the brand manufacturer characterized the no-AG agreement 
as an ""exclusive license,"" the Third Circuit declined to adopt this characterization: ""We do not believe the no-AG agreement was 
in fact an 'exclusive' license. However, since the issue of whether such agreement is an exclusive license is not necessary for 
our decision here, we will leave its determination for another day."" Id. at 406 n.27."
1371,4," In the context of reverse payments, courts performing the rule of reason analysis must consider ""antitrust factors such as likely 
anticompetitive effects, redeeming virtues, market power, and potentially offsetting legal considerations present in the 
circumstances, such as here those related to patents."" FTC v. Actavis, 133 S. Ct. at 2231."
1371,5," Currax does not address the other forms of competitive harm that may arise from a no-AG provision in a settlement agreement, 
such as avoidance of the risk of patent invalidation or a finding of noninfringement, or an extended monopoly for the brand 
company if the generic company's entry date is later than the entry date the generic company would have otherwise accepted. 
King Drug Co., 791 F.3d at 405 (quoting Actavis, 133 S. Ct. at 2236). "
1372,6," Currax represents that Roxane did, in fact, launch an authorized generic product during the 180-day exclusivity period: ""And in 
fact, it did that. It actually did launch an authorized generic through the relevant time period. And the parties briefed that."" 
(3/3/2020 Tr. at 25:14-17) The briefing in the case is heavily redacted, and the court was unable to substantiate the launch of an 
authorized generic by Roxane during the exclusivity period. The operative complaint suggests that Boehringer declined to launch 
an authorized generic because of the settlement agreement: On information and belief, BI has launched at least four authorized generics between 1999 and 2012. On information and 
belief, in at least two of those instances, BI launched an authorized generic through its subsidiary Roxane Laboratories, Inc. 
On information and belief, these two launches were not the result of the settlement of patent litigation involving the 
presumed FTF. On information and belief, BI would have launched an [*15]  authorized generic version of Aggrenox upon 
market entry by Barr/Teva in the absence of the anticompetitive agreement here. (D. Conn. C.A. No. 3:14-md-2516, D.I. 97 at ¶ 71; see also D.I. 194 at 15 (""Had Barr not accepted the payments and delayed 
entry, it would have faced stiff competition from Boehringer's authorized generic version of Aggrenox and six months later from 
other generic entrants.""); D.I. 149 at 47 (arguing that ""BI retained the freedom to introduce an AG through its generic affiliate 
Roxane,"" without suggesting that Roxane in fact launched an authorized generic during the exclusivity period)). Regardless, the 
court did not acknowledge the existence of two competing generics in its decision. "
1379,1," Virginic also argues that the innocent infringer defense is allowed pursuant to 15 U.S.C. § 1114(2), where ""an infringer or 
violator is engaged solely in the business of printing the mark or violating matter for others and establishes that he or she was an 
innocent infringer or innocent violator."" In that circumstance, the owner of the mark is only entitled to an injunction. But Virginic 
does not appear to assert in its pleading or brief that it was solely printing the Virginic mark or violating matter for others. This 
argument is not persuasive. "
1381,2," Neither side cites any authority that the Noerr-Pennington doctrine would not apply to Plaintiff's petitioning activity outside of the 
United States. "
1382,3," Neither party asserts that Virginic mistakenly pled antitrust as a defense instead of a counterclaim. The Court relies on Rule 
8(c)(2) only as analogous support here. "
1383,4, The Court does not imply that Twombly and Iqbal's plausibility standards should otherwise apply to affirmative defenses. 
1389,1," Were the Court to reach the third and most contested Sherman Act element—dangerous probability of achieving monopoly 
power—it would deny both the Chandler Plaintiffs' and Phoenix Defendants' motions for summary judgment. Based on the

Defendants' assertion that ""courts give heavy weight to a state's determination that an activity constitutes the 'business of

limited to restrictions on selling larger packs of beer and pack-up pricing, so the court has made the same assumption.""). "
1438,2," In addition to challenging the merits of Mountain Crest's claims, defendants raise secondary and relatively brief arguments 
about whether the United States is the proper forum for this case under the doctrines of comity and forum non conveniens. But 
defendants' comity argument rests entirely on a test that neither the Supreme Court nor the Court of Appeals for the Seventh 
Circuit has adopted. See In re Vitamin C Antitrust Litig., 837 F.3d 175, 183 (2d Cir. 2016), vacated and remanded sub nom. 
Animal Sci. Prod., Inc. v. Hebei Welcome Pharm. Co., 138 S. Ct. 1865 201 L. Ed. 2d 225 (2018). And defendants' forum non 
conveniens argument is not well developed. So the court concludes that defendants have not satisfied their ""heavy burden"" to 
show that Mountain Crest should have filed this case in Canada rather than in Mountain Crest's home district. See In re Factor 
VIII or IX Concentrate Blood Products Litigation, 484 F.3d 951, 955-56 (7th Cir. 2007) (""[W]hen the plaintiff has sued in his or her

conveniens bears a heavy burden in opposing the plaintiff's chosen forum."" (internal quotation marks, citations, and alterations

1440,5," In fact, as noted in one of the attachments to Mountain Crest's complaint, even in 2000, the LCBO recognized that the six-pack

3969, para. 157 (Can. Ont. S.C.J.) (WL) aff'd 145 O.R.3d 401 (Can. Ont. C.A.). (""The 2000 Beer Framework Agreement did not 
change much in the way that the LCBO and Brewers Retail each operated. . . . Both before and after the Agreement was 
adopted, government policy precluded the LCBO from selling 12-packs and 24-packs at Ordinary Stores.""). "
1442,6," For example, defendants say that BRI is an integrated joint venture, so it is ""incapable"" of engaging in a conspiracy; Mountain 
Crest has failed to define the relevant market; Mountain Crest hasn't identified an agreement that is ""per se"" illegal; a joint 
monopolization claim is not cognizable under § 2 of the Sherman Act; and the complaint includes no facts showing an intent to 
monopolize. Dkt. 76, at 34-42. "
1447,1," On October 15, 2019, I issued a Report and Recommendation recommending that the Court grant Defendant's motion to

Comcast Corp., No. 16-5486, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24213, 2017 WL 698681, at *5-6 (N.D. Ill. Feb. 22, 2017). Plaintiff filed an 
objection to my Report and Recommendation (D.I. 18) and Defendant responded (D.I. 20). On February 24, 2020, after I issued my original Report and Recommendation, the Seventh Circuit reversed the district court's 
decision in Viamedia. 951 F.3d 429 (7th Cir. 2020). On March 9, 2020, Chief Judge Stark referred proceedings on Defendant's 
motion to dismiss back to me ""to evaluate the impact, if any, of the Seventh Circuit's decision in Viamedia"" before he 
""address[ed] the pending motion and objections to the Report and Recommendation."" (D.I. 25.) On March 10, 2020, I requested 
supplemental briefing regarding Viamedia. Plaintiff filed a brief on March 27, 2020 (D.I. 26), and Defendant filed a brief on April 
9, 2020 (D.I. 28). Having reviewed the parties' briefs, I now issue a revised Report and Recommendation. My recommendation 
to GRANT Defendant's motion to dismiss remains the same."

1451,5," My original Report and Recommendation cited as authority Viamedia, Inc. v. Comcast Corp., No. 16-5486, 2017 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 24213, 2017 WL 698681, at *5-6 (N.D. Ill. Feb. 22, 2017) and VBR Tours, LLC v. Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp., No. 14-804, 
2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 130455, 2015 WL 5693735, at *9 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 28, 2015). The district court's decision in Viamedia was 
subsequently reversed by the Seventh Circuit on appeal and, in light of that decision, it is debatable whether VBR Tours would 
have come out the same way. As mentioned above, see supra note 1, the parties filed supplemental briefs addressing the impact, if any, of the Seventh 
Circuit's decision in Viamedia. Not surprisingly, City Smiles argues that I should reconsider my earlier recommendation to 
dismiss the Complaint. It argues that the ""no economic sense"" test requires a balancing of anticompetitive and procompetitive 
effects, which the Seventh Circuit suggested was inappropriate at the pleading stage. See Viamedia, 951 F.3d at 462. Align, on 
the other hand, points out that the Seventh Circuit's opinion expressly refrained from delineating a new pleading standard for 
refusal to deal cases. See id. at 463. Align further argues that the Seventh Circuit's decision relied on similarities between the 
complaint in that case and the relevant facts from Aspen Skiing, see Viamedia, 951 F.3d at 458-463, and that those similarities 
are absent here. Align also points out that the Seventh Circuit's decision did not challenge the applicability of the ""no economic 
sense"" test to refusal to deal cases. Id. at 461-62. Having carefully considered the Seventh Circuit's decision in Viamedia, I do not think it would change the outcome here even if it 
were binding on this Court (which it is not). To start with, it would be inconsistent with the Supreme Court's decision in Trinko to 
hold that a plaintiff can proceed with a refusal to deal claim merely by pleading the defendant's market power and an "
1452,," exclusionary effect resulting from its refusal to deal. 540 U.S. at 409 (dismissing refusal to deal claim because it lacked features 
present in Aspen Skiing). Something more is required. The Seventh Circuit's Viamedia decision did not attempt to define the precise contours of an adequately pleaded refusal to deal 
claim. While it did not define the minimum necessary, it did hold that pleading ""some of the key anticompetitive characteristics"" 
of Aspen Skiing was sufficient. See 951 F.3d at 462 (""To the extent that refusal-to-deal claims require more at the pleading 
stage, it is enough to allege plausibly that the refusal to deal has some of the key anticompetitive characteristics identified in 
Aspen Skiing.""). In this case, unlike in Viamedia, the Complaint fails to allege certain key aspects of Aspen Skiing. For example, unlike in Aspen 
Skiing and Viamedia where the terminated business relationships had been ongoing for years and the termination was alleged to 
result in financial losses to the defendants, 3Shape and Align's business relationship only lasted 15 months and there is no 
allegation that the termination resulted in losses across Align's business lines. There is also no allegation that Align refused to 
sell any product to 3Shape at retail price, as in Aspen Skiing and Viamedia. Moreover, no one in this case seriously disputes that, to ultimately succeed on a refusal to deal claim, a plaintiff must prove that 
the defendant's conduct was irrational but for its anticompetitive effect, i.e., that it made no economic sense but for its tendency 
to lessen competition. That requirement has been endorsed not only by the Supreme Court, see Aspen Skiing, 472 U.S. at 597; 
Trinko, 540 U.S. at 409, but also by circuit courts, see, e.g., Novell, 731 F.3d at 1074-75, the United States Department of 
Justice, see, e.g., Brief for the United States as Amicus Curiae in Support of Neither Party, Viamedia, Inc. v. Comcast Corp., No. 
18-2852, 2018 WL 5919386, at *11-16 (7th Cir. Nov. 8, 2018), and other leading authorities. See Areeda & Hovencamp, 
Antitrust Law ¶ 772d3 (Supp. 2019); Gregory J. Werden, Identifying Exclusionary Conduct Under Section 2: The ""No Economic 
Sense"" Test, 73 Antitrust L.J. 413, 414 (2006). I do not read the Seventh Circuit's Viamedia decision to the contrary. And, given 
that to succeed on a refusal to deal claim a plaintiff must ultimately prove that a defendant's conduct was irrational but for its 
anticompetitive effect, a plaintiff must also allege facts in its complaint making such a claim plausible. Cf. Comcast Corporation 
v. National Association of African American-Owned Media, 140 S. Ct. 1009, 1014, 206 L. Ed. 2d 356 (2020) (""[T]o determine 
what the plaintiff must plausibly allege at the outset of a lawsuit, we usually ask what the plaintiff must prove in the trial at its 
end.""). In my view, the most significant difference between this case and Viamedia is that the complaint in that case expressly alleged 
that the defendant's conduct was ""irrational but for its anticompetitive effect"" and contained factual allegations to back it up. 951 
F.3d at 463. As the Seventh Circuit summarized: In a section of the First Amended Complaint entitled 'Comcast's Refusal to Deal with Viamedia is Irrational But for its 
Anticompetitive Effects,' [Plaintiff] Viamedia walked through the long-term course of dealing prior to [Defendant] Comcast's 
conduct; the subsequent degradation of the value of the cooperative Interconnects; the financial losses suffered by 
Comcast itself, as well as by Viamedia and Comcast's competitor MVPDs; Comcast's willingness to offer Interconnect-only 
access in other markets where it did face competition; and the fact that ""[t]here are no procompetitive justifications"" to be 
achieved by [Comcast's] conduct [*17]  given that there were ""no material administrability problems in allowing Viamedia to 
participate in Interconnects"" on behalf of its MVPD customers. Id. (emphases added). Here, in contrast, City Smiles did not allege that Align's conduct was irrational but for its anticompetitive effect. Nor did it allege 
facts that would suggest the same, for example, that Align suffered financial losses across business lines. City Smiles only 
alleges that Align lost profits in one of two relevant product lines. (D.I. 1 ¶¶ 16, 78.) That is not enough. See Novell, 731 F.3d at 
1075, 1077 (holding that courts must look at profits across business lines to determine if conduct is economically irrational). 
Insofar as City Smiles contends that it can prevail on its refusal to deal claim with a showing that Align suffered a loss in only one 
product line, it is wrong as a matter of law. And there is no reason to let a legally deficient claim proceed past the pleading stage. I am mindful of the Seventh Circuit's admonition that it is inappropriate to weigh procompetitive justifications proffered by the 
defendant against anticompetitive harms at the pleading stage. Viamedia, 951 F.3d at 460, 462. But I do not consider any 
procompetitive justifications offered by Align, nor do I balance procompetitive justifications against anticompetitive harms. 
Rather, I consider whether City Smiles' own allegations plausibly allege that Align's termination of the interoperability agreement 
was irrational but for its anticompetitive purpose. I conclude that they do not. "
1453,6," Perhaps recognizing the difficulty in proceeding under the refusal to deal doctrine, City Smiles tries to recast Align's termination 
of the Interoperability Agreement as a design change to Align's manufacturing process. (D.I. 12 at 15.) That does not change the 
analysis. Whatever you want to call it, the result was that Align quit accepting orders for Invisalign from 3Shape's Trios scanner. 
That makes this a refusal to deal case, and City Smiles cannot evade refusal to deal doctrine simply by calling the conduct 
another name. See Novell, 731 F.3d at 1079 (""Whether one chooses to call a monopolist's refusal to deal with a rival an act or 
omission, interference or withdrawal of assistance, the substance is the same and it must be analyzed under the traditional 
[refusal to deal] test . . . ."")."
1453,7," The Complaint does not allege that the design of Align's iTero Element scanner has ever changed. The Court is therefore not 
confronted with an allegation of anticompetitive product redesign. Nor does this case concern the interoperability or integration of complementary products in two markets, as was at issue in 
United States v. Microsoft. 253 F.3d 34, 64-67, 346 U.S. App. D.C. 330 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (assessing antitrust consequences 
relating to the interoperability of browser and operating system under circumstances where the defendant's products were 
distributed together and could not be disaggregated). Unlike the product markets at issue in Microsoft, intraoral scanners and 
aligners are sold independently, can be used independently, and don't interact with each other in operation. "
1455,8," In the alternative, Align sought transfer of the case to the Northern District of California. (D.I. 7.) Because I recommend that the 
case be dismissed, I do not address Align's transfer arguments. See Tr. 15 (Align's agreement that dismissal in lieu of transfer is 
appropriate)."
1455,9," Antitrust standing is a prudential limitation. As it does not affect subject matter jurisdiction, there is no requirement that the 
Court consider it at this time. See Shionogi Pharma, Inc. v. Mylan, Inc., No. 10-1077, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 58774, 2011 WL 
2174499, *3 (D. Del. May 26, 2011) (dismissing Section 2 claim for failure to state a claim without addressing the parties' dispute 
over antitrust standing)."
1455,10," Plaintiff's Complaint also alleged a class. The Court need not address class certification before dismissing the case. See, e.g., 
Donnenfeld v. Petro Home Servs., No. 16-882, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 43945, 2017 WL 1250992, at *6 (D.N.J. Mar. 24, 2017) 
(""[B]ecause the Court is dismissing the Complaint, the Court will not consider Defendants' arguments regarding class 
certification at this time.""). "
1456,11," Align requests that the Complaint be dismissed without leave to amend because any amendment would be futile. However, it 
is not clear on this limited record that amendment would necessarily be futile. See Alston v. Parker, 363 F.3d 229, 235-36 (3d 
Cir. 2004) (holding that leave to amend should be granted ""unless a curative amendment would be inequitable, futile, or 
untimely""). "
1458,1," That plaintiff may never be able to prove the quantity of such damages does not mean she has not suffered injury in fact. See 
Blue Cross and Blue Shield United of Wis. v. Marshfield Clinic, 152 F.3d 588, 594 (7th Cir. 1998) (""We are not saying that Blue 
Cross did not in fact lose any money as a result of the division of markets. . . . [T]here is . . . , and here critically, a difference 
between an actual and a quantifiable harm and also between a quantifiable and a quantified harm—and only the last supports 
an award of damages.""). "
1459,2," Defendants argue that plaintiff's allegation that the no-hire clause depressed her wages is not plausible in light of the Court's 
conclusion in Deslandes that Deslandes had not stated a claim for a per se violation of the antitrust laws. The Court disagrees. 
The reason Deslandes had not alleged a per se violation was not that a no-hire agreement would be unlikely to depress wages 
but rather that the no-hire agreement was ancillary to an agreement that was procompetitive in that it enhanced the output of 
hamburgers. "
1461,3," This does not mean a plaintiff can recover for depressed wages that were paid to her more than four years before filing suit. 
See Klehr, 521 U.S. at 189 (""But the commission of a separate new overt act generally does not permit the plaintiff to recover for 
the injury caused by old overt acts outside the limitations period.""). "
1463,1," The Court writes for the parties and assumes familiarity with the facts. For a detailed account of the relevant facts, refer to this 
Court's July 30, 2019 Opinion on Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint. (ECF No. 31.) "
1464,2," Importantly, the Third Circuit has also held that although defining a proper market can be a fact intensive inquiry requiring 
discovery, see Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Tech. Servs, Inc., 504 U.S. 451, 482, 112 S. Ct. 2072, 119 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1992), 
there is no ""per se prohibition against dismissal of antitrust claims for failure to plead a relevant market under Fed. R. Civ. P. 
12(b)(6)."" Queen City, 124 F.3d at 436. "
1469,1," The facts underlying this dispute are set forth in the Memorandum Opinion of February 4, 2020. ECF 40. Those facts are 
incorporated herein. The facts presented in this Memorandum Opinion are limited to those pertinent to the Motion to Reconsider."
1469,2," At his deposition, Mr. Clark testified that he believed that his work schedule did not include a break for lunch. ECF 29-1 at 4, Tr. 
67-68. Although not entirely clear, it appears that Ms. Richardson received an unpaid lunch break. ECF 28-2 at 8, Tr. 29. "
1472,3," Plaintiffs filed the Motion pursuant to Local Rule 105.10. With exceptions not applicable here, Local Rule 105.10 provides that 
""any motion to reconsider any order issued by the Court shall be filed with the Clerk not later than fourteen (14) days after entry 
of the order."" There is no contention here that the Motion is untimely. "
1477,4," Although the Company's contention is found only in the last sentence of the lengthy brief's penultimate page, it suffices to raise 
the issue of whether Ms. Richardson spoke with Mr. Clark's concerning his overtime. "
1501,1," The unfair competition law is set forth at Business and Professions Code section 17200 et seq. Although the Legislature has 
not given an official name to these statutory provisions, the legislation has generally been referred to as the unfair competition 
law, and we will refer to this statute as the UCL. (See Cel-Tech Communications, Inc. v. Los Angeles Cellular Telephone Co. 
(1999) 20 Cal.4th 163, 169, fn. 2 [83 Cal. Rptr. 2d 548, 973 P.2d 527] (Cel-Tech).)"
1501,2, The FAL is set forth at Business and Professions Code section 17500 et seq. 
1502,3," As initially filed, the complaint also alleged that Nationwide's practices violated the Check Sellers, Bill Payers and Proraters 
Law (Fin. Code, § 12200 et seq.) and asserted causes of action under that statute. While this case was pending before this 
court, those causes of action were dismissed as part of a larger settlement between the Department of Business Oversight and 
Nationwide. The underlying action now rests solely on the causes of action under the UCL and the FAL set forth in the 
complaint."
1502,4," In the action brought by the CFPB, the federal district court, after a seven-day bench trial, found that although some of the 
claims advanced by the CFPB were not meritorious, Nationwide had made a variety of misleading statements in its marketing 
materials. The court imposed injunctive relief and civil penalties of more than $7 million against Nationwide based on that 
misleading conduct. (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau v. Nationwide Biweekly Administration, Inc. (N.D.Cal., Sept. 8, "
1503,2017," , No. 15-cv-02106-RS) 2017 WL 3948396, pp. *6–*9, *12–*13.) Both parties filed appeals from the district court's decision, 
that are pending in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. (Case Nos. 18-15431 & 18-15887, filed Mar. 15, 
2018, & May 10, 2018.)"
1503,5," In the answer brief filed in this court, Nationwide claims that the government seeks to impose “over $19.25 billion in civil 
penalties.” The complaint, however, seeks no specific amount in penalties, and, as explained hereafter, the applicable statutes 
and case law grant trial courts broad, but not unlimited, discretion to impose penalties in a reasonable amount (up to $2,500 per 
violation) in light of the nature and severity of an offending business's conduct. (Post, at pp. 299, 307, 313.) The answer's 
hyperbole in this regard does not advance its legal argument. "
1505,6," The 1933 amendment also defined “unfair competition” to include any violation of the then-existing provisions of Penal Code 
former sections 654a, 654b, or 654c, all of which prohibited different specific forms of false advertising. (Stats. 1933, ch. 953, § 
1, p. 2482 [Civ. Code, former § 3369, subd. (3)].)"
1505,7," In the statewide election held in November 2004, the voters approved Proposition 64, an initiative statute that restricted the 
kinds of private plaintiffs that may seek an injunction or other equitable relief under the UCL or the FAL (Bus. & Prof. Code, §§ "
1506,17203," , 17204, 17535) and provided that the revenue from the civil penalties imposed under the UCL or the FAL may be used 
only by the Attorney General and local public prosecutors for the enforcement of consumer protection laws. (Bus. & Prof. Code, 
§§ 17206, subd. (c), 17536, subd. (c).) The changes effectuated by Proposition 64 have no direct bearing on the issue before us."
1506,8," The very broad consumer protective language set forth in the UCL closely tracks the broad language that Congress embodied 
in the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. § 41 et seq.) to reach business practices that were not specifically forbidden by 
the common law or other statutes. (See 15 U.S.C. § 45(a) [“Unfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce, and unfair 
or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce” are declared unlawful]; see generally Baker & Baum, Section 5 of the 
Federal Trade Commission Act: A Continuing Process of Redefinition (1962) 7 Vill. L.Rev. 517, 525–542.) California decisions 
have long recognized the close relationship between the language of the UCL and the Federal Trade Commission Act. (See, 
e.g., People ex rel. Mosk v. National Research Co. (1962) 201 Cal.App.2d 765, 772–773 [20 Cal. Rptr. 516].) The United States Supreme Court, in discussing the Federal Trade Commission's exercise of its authority to determine whether 
a trade practice is “unfair” under the Federal Trade Commission Act in FTC v. Sperry & Hutchinson Co. (1972) 405 U.S. 233, "
1507,244," [31 L.Ed.2d 170, 92 S.Ct. 898], concluded that “legislative and judicial authorities alike convince us that the Federal Trade 
Commission does not arrogate excessive power to itself if, in measuring a practice against the elusive, but congressionally 
mandated standard of fairness, it, like a court of equity, considers public values beyond simply those enshrined in the letter or 
encompassed in the spirit of antitrust laws.” (Italics added.)"
1507,9," See People v. Casa Blanca Convalescent Homes, Inc. (1984) 159 Cal.App.3d 509, 530 [206 Cal. Rptr. 164], which stated that 
“an ‘unfair’ business practice occurs when it offends an established public policy or when the practice is immoral, unethical, 
oppressive, unscrupulous or substantially injurious to consumers,” and State Farm Fire & Casualty Co. v. Superior Court (1996) 
45 Cal.App.4th 1093, 1104 [53 Cal. Rptr. 2d 229], which declared that in determining whether a business practice is unfair “‘the 
court must weigh the utility of the defendant's conduct against the gravity of the harm to the alleged victim.’” "
1508,10," One line of Court of Appeal decisions has held that a balancing test, which the Cel-Tech court declined to adopt in the 
competitor context (see Cel-Tech, supra, 20 Cal.4th at pp. 184–185), should nonetheless be applied in the consumer context, 
under which the determination whether a business practice is unfair to consumers “‘“involves an examination of [that practice's] 
impact on its alleged victim, balanced against the reasons, justifications and motives of the alleged wrongdoer. In brief, the court 
must weigh the utility of the defendant's conduct against the gravity of the harm to the alleged victim.”’” (Smith v. State Farm 
Mutual Automobile Ins. Co. (2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 700, 718 [113 Cal. Rptr. 2d 399]; see, e.g., Ticconi v. Blue Shield of California 
Life & Health Ins. Co. (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 528, 539 [72 Cal. Rptr. 3d 888]; cf. FTC v. Sperry & Hutchinson Co., supra, 405 
U.S. 233, 244–245, fn. 5 [quoting with approval similar test adopted by FTC in 1964 for determining unfairness under § 5 of the 
FTC Act].) A second line of Court of Appeal decisions has adopted what has been termed a “tethering test,” requiring that “the public policy 
which is a predicate to [a consumer unfair competition action under the “unfair” prong of the UCL] must be ‘tethered’ to specific 
constitutional, statutory or regulatory provisions” in a manner similar to which Cel-Tech requires a competitor's cause of action to 
be tethered to the antitrust laws. (Gregory v. Albertson's, Inc. (2002) 104 Cal.App.4th 845, 854 [128 Cal. Rptr. 2d 389]; see, e.g., 
Scripps Clinic v. Superior Court (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 917, 940 [134 Cal. Rptr. 2d 101].) A third line of Court of Appeal cases has adopted the three-part definition of unfairness applied under section 5 of the FTC Act 
since 1980, namely that: “(1) The consumer injury must be substantial; (2) the injury must not be outweighed by any 
countervailing benefits to consumers or competition; and (3) it must be an injury that consumers themselves could not 
reasonably have avoided.” (Camacho v. Automobile Club of Southern California (2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 1394, 1403 [48 Cal. 
Rptr. 3d 770]; see, e.g., Rubenstein v. The Gap, Inc. (2017) 14 Cal.App.5th 870, 880 [222 Cal. Rptr. 3d 397].) This test has 
sometimes been termed the “section 5 test.” "
1509,11," The FAL traces its origin to the 1915 version of former section 654a of the Penal Code (Stats. 1915, ch. 634, § 1, pp. 1252–
1253), which, in turn, was based upon a model false advertising statute that was first proposed in 1911 in Printer's Ink magazine, 
an advertising journal. (See Note, The Regulation of Advertising (1956) 56 Colum. L.Rev. 1018, 1058; Note, Enforcing 
California's False Advertising Law: A Guide to Adjudication (1974) 25 Hastings L.J. 1105, 1106.) The 1911 model statute 
proposed to make it a misdemeanor to publish an advertisement containing “‘any assertion, representation or statement of fact 
which is untrue, deceptive or misleading’” and was quite stringent, omitting any requirement that the advertiser be shown to have 
intended to deceive or to know the improper character of the advertisement. (Note, The Regulation of Advertising, supra, 56 
Colum. L.Rev. at pp. 1058–1059 & fn. 245.) In adopting the statute in California in 1915, however, the Legislature added a 
scienter requirement, requiring a showing that the advertiser knew or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known of 
the false, deceptive or misleading character of the advertisement. (Stats. 1915, ch. 634, § 1, pp. 1252–1253.) "
1510,12," After the trial court ruling but prior to our decision in Jayhill, the Legislature had explicitly amended Business and Professions 
Code section 17535 to authorize the court to order restitution as well as injunctive relief. (Stats. 1972, ch. 244, § 1, p. 494.) In 
Jayhill, the court found that in light of its legislative history, the 1972 amendment was not intended “to create a new power in the 
trial court but simply to clarify existing law on the point.” (Jayhill, supra, 9 Cal.3d at p. 287, fn. 1.) "
1511,13," As noted above (ante, p. 297), the UCL contains an overlapping prohibition of impermissible advertising, barring, in addition to 
“any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or practice,” any “unfair, deceptive, untrue or misleading advertising.” (Bus. & 
Prof. Code, § 17200.) "
1512,14," For a general discussion of the numerous and complex factors and considerations that may affect the determination whether 
advertising should properly be viewed as deceptive or misleading, see Developments in the Law—Deceptive Advertising (1967) 
80 Harv. L.Rev. 1005, 1038–1063. "
1514,15," At oral argument, counsel for Nationwide suggested that in federal court juries often decide such questions in actions under 
the FTC Act in which civil penalties are sought. Under the FTC Act, however, civil penalties may be sought only for a defendant's 
violation of a prior cease and desist order (15 U.S.C. § 45(l), (m)(1)(B)) or for a defendant's knowing violation of a specific trade 
regulation rule (15 U.S.C. § 45(m)(1)(A)). Although federal courts have held that there is a right to a jury trial in such actions, the 
jury in such actions does not determine whether the practice is unfair or deceptive within the meaning of the FTC Act, but rather 
determines only whether the defendant violated the existing cease and desist order or the specific trade regulation rule. (See, 
e.g., U.S. v. J.B. Williams Co. (2d Cir. 1974) 498 F.2d 414, 421–430; U.S. v. Dish Network, LLC (C.D.Ill. 2010) 754 F.Supp.2d 
1002, 1003–1004; see also 15 U.S.C. § 45(m)(2) [providing that when the cease and desist order was not issued against the 
particular defendant from whom civil penalties are sought, upon request “the court shall … review the determination of law made 
by the Commission … that the act or practice which was the subject of such proceeding constituted an unfair or deceptive act or 
practice in violation of subsection (a)” (italics added)].) "
1516,16," In Raedeke itself, the court, after confirming the existence and validity of the “equity first preference,” held that a plaintiff who 
brings an action presenting both legal and equitable issues can avoid the potential loss of a jury trial on common issues by 
electing to forgo the equitable claim and thus removing the equitable issues from the case. (See Raedeke, supra, 10 Cal.3d at 
pp. 671–672.) "
1517,17," Contrary to the implication of the Court of Appeal decision below (see Nationwide Biweekly, supra, 24 Cal.App.5th at p. 456), 
this court's recent decision in Shaw, supra, 2 Cal.5th 983 did not purport to abrogate or change this state's well-established 
“equity first preference” doctrine. In Shaw, we interpreted one provision of the statute before the court—Health and Safety Code 
section 1278.5, subdivision (m), which provided that nothing in the new legislation “abrogate[s] or limit[s] any other theory of 
liability or remedy otherwise available at law”—as preserving in full a plaintiff's complementary cause of action under Tameny v. 
Atlantic Richfield Co. (1980) 27 Cal.3d 167 [164 Cal. Rptr. 839, 610 P.2d 1330], including the plaintiff's right to obtain a jury 
resolution of the Tameny claim. (Shaw, supra, 2 Cal.5th at p. 1006.) Shaw did not purport to overrule or disapprove the 
numerous California decisions cited above that have applied the “equity first preference” doctrine for more than a century. Because in this case the equitable and legal aspects of the UCL and FAL actions are nonseverable and because Nationwide 
has not questioned the continued vitality of the “equity first preference” doctrine, we have no occasion to consider whether there 
is any reason to reevaluate this doctrine or to determine its proper application in a particular context. "
1518,18," The legislation was adopted by the voters at the November 4, 1986 General Election. The Legislature has amended relevant 
provisions of the act on numerous occasions since its inception. (See Stats. 1999, ch. 599, § 1, p. 4297; Stats. 2001, ch. 578, § 
1, p. 4748; Stats. 2002, ch. 323, § 1, p. 1265; Stats. 2003, ch. 62, § 185, p. 500; Stats. 2013, ch. 581, § 1; Stats. 2014, ch. 71, § 
90; Stats. 2014, ch. 828, § 1; Stats 2017, ch. 510, § 1.) For convenience, we shall refer to the legislation in its current form as 
Proposition 65. "
1519,19," Health & Safety Code section 25249.7, subdivision (b)(2) provides in full: “In assessing the amount of a civil penalty for a 
violation of this chapter, the court shall consider all of the following: “(A) The nature and extent of the violation. “(B) The number of, and severity of, the violations. “(C) The economic effect of the penalty on the violator. “(D) Whether the violator took good faith measures to comply with this chapter and the time these measures were taken. “(E) The willfulness of the violator's misconduct. “(F) The deterrent effect that the imposition of the penalty would have on both the violator and the regulated community as a 
whole. “(G) Any other factor that justice may require.” "
1520,20," In his seminal article on the right to civil jury trial, Professor Fleming James observed that, at common law, when a plaintiff 
was seeking to obtain both injunctive relief and civil penalties for a defendant's alleged statutory violation, the plaintiff would 
have been required to bring two separate actions—one in equity and one in law. As Professor James explained: “B's violation of 
A's statutory right … might entitle A to an injunction, to compensatory damages, and to a penalty. The right to any relief would 
turn on whether B violated the statute. A might get a determination of that issue without a jury in an equity suit, seeking an 
injunction and perhaps compensatory damages as incidental to an injunction. Or he might get such determination in an action at 
law for damages or for the penalty. Since equity refused to enforce a penalty and the law would not give an injunction, two suits 
would be required for complete relief. A had the choice which to bring first. And the first determination of the common issue 
(violation vel non) would bind the parties in the second action. The plaintiff then had the power to choose the mode of trial of the 
common issue, and he could so exercise it as to leave no room for judicial discretion.” (James, Right to a Jury Trial in Civil "
1521,," Actions (1963) 72 Yale L.J. 655, 671–672, fns. omitted.) Thus, as a general matter, at common law when a plaintiff sought both 
injunctive relief and civil penalties based upon a business's alleged violation of a statute, the business was by no means 
guaranteed that the question whether it violated the statute would be determined by a jury rather than by a court. "
1523,21," In concluding that the gist of the causes of action created by the UCL and the FAL is equitable even when civil penalties as 
well as injunctive relief are sought, we have relied on the specific attributes of the California UCL and FAL statutes, as well as 
the established understanding of the scope of the California constitutional jury trial provision. Every other state has adopted consumer protection legislation somewhat comparable to the UCL and the FAL. (See, e.g., Stern, 
Cal. Practice Guide: Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200 Practice, supra, ¶¶ 2:54-2:62, pp. 2-22 to 2-24; Nat. Consumer Law Center, 
Unfair and Deceptive Acts and Practices (9th ed. 2016) § 1.1., p. 1.) Although the numerous unfair or deceptive practice statutes 
in other jurisdictions differ from the California statutes in a variety of respects, we note that a substantial majority of other state 
courts that have addressed the question whether there is a right to a jury trial in civil actions brought under those states' unfair or 
deceptive practice laws have concluded that there is no right to a jury trial in such actions. (See Nunley v. State (Ala. 1993) 628 
So.2d 619, 621–622; People v. Shifrin (2014) 2014 COA 14 [342 P.3d 506, 512–513]; Associated Investment Co. Limited 
Partnership v. Williams Associates IV (1994) 230 Conn. 148 [645 A.2d 505, 508–512]; Martin v. Heinold Commodities (1994) 
163 Ill.2d 33 [205 Ill.Dec. 443, 643 N.E.2d 734, 753]; Nei v. Burley (1983) 388 Mass. 307 [446 N.E.2d 674, 678–679]; State by 
Humphrey v. Alpine Air Products, Inc. (Minn.Ct.App. 1992) 490 N.W.2d 888, 895; State ex rel. Douglas v. Schroeder (1986) 222 
Neb. 473 [384 N.W.2d 626, 629–630]; State v. State Credit Assn. (1983) 33 Wn.App. 617 [657 P.2d 327, 330].) Several states 
have reached a contrary conclusion, but none of those cases involved a statute that created a cause of action in which both 
injunctive relief as well as damages or civil penalties could be obtained. (See Robinson v. McDougal (1988) 62 Ohio App.3d 253 
[575 N.E.2d 469, 474]; State v. Credit Bureau of Loredo, Inc. (Tex. 1975) 530 S.W.2d 288, 290–292; State v. Abbott 
Laboratories (2012) 2012 WI 62 [341 Wis.2d 510, 816 N.W.2d 145, 156–159].) (See generally Annot., Constitutional Right to 
Jury Trial in Cause of Action Under State Unfair or Deceptive Trade Practices Law (1997) 54 A.L.R.5th 631.) "
1524,22," Although the court in Tull held that the Seventh Amendment granted the developer a right to a jury trial on the issue of liability, 
the majority went on to hold that the Seventh Amendment did not require a jury trial on the amount of civil penalties. The majority 
explained that because “highly discretionary calculations that take into account multiple factors are necessary in order to set civil 
penalties under the Clean Water Act” and “[t]hese are the kinds of calculations traditionally performed by judges,” “the Seventh 
Amendment does not require a jury trial for that purpose in a civil action.” (Tull, supra, 481 U.S. at p. 427.) Justice Scalia, joined by Justice Stevens, dissented from the latter holding, objecting that by fashioning a civil action in which 
liability but not the amount of damages is to be decided by a jury, “the Court creates a form of civil adjudication I have never 
encountered.” (Tull, supra, 481 U.S. at p. 428 (dis. opn. of Scalia, J.).) "
1525,23," We note that since the decision in Tull, a number of state courts, in interpreting and applying their own state constitutional civil 
jury trial provisions, have concluded, unlike the Tull decision, that there is no right to a jury trial in statutory causes of action 
authorizing both injunctive relief and civil penalties. (See, e.g., State ex rel. Darwin v. Arnett (2014) 235 Ariz. 239 [330 P.3d 996, 
1002]; Commissioner of Environmental Protection v. Connecticut Building Wrecking Co. (1993) 227 Conn. 175 [629 A.2d 1116, 
1121–1123]; Dept. of Environmental Protection v. Emerson (Me. 1992) 616 A.2d 1268, 1271; Dept. of Environmental Quality v. 
Morley (2015) 314 Mich.App. 306 [885 N.W.2d 892, 897]; State v. Irving Oil Corp. (2008) 183 Vt. 386 [955 A.2d 1098, 1106–
1108]; State v. Evergreen Freedom Foundation (2002) 111 Wn.App. 586 [49 P.3d 894, 908–909].) A few states that have 
traditionally looked to the Seventh Amendment in interpreting their own state jury trial provision have followed Tull. (See, e.g., 
Dept. of Revenue v. Printing House (Fla. 1994) 644 So.2d 498, 500–501; Bendick v. Cambio (R.I. 1989) 558 A.2d 941, 943–
944.) "
1526,24," California is by no means alone in employing a holistic, qualitative standard for determining whether an action involving both 
legal and equitable aspects should be characterized as legal or equitable for purposes of an applicable constitutional jury trial 
provision. (See, e.g., Miller v. Carnation Co. (1973) 33 Colo.App. 62 [516 P.2d 661, 663] [“Where there are legal and equitable 
claims joined in the complaint the court must determine whether the basic thrust of the action is equitable or legal in nature”]; 
Commissioner of Environmental Protection v. Connecticut Building Wrecking Co., supra, 629 A.2d 1116, 1121 [“In a case that 
involves both legal and equitable claims, ‘“whether the right to a jury trial attaches depends upon the relative importance of the 
two types of claims”’”]; Shaner v. Horizon Bancorp. (1989) 116 N.J. 433 [561 A.2d 1130, 1139] [“we have eschewed a focus 
solely on the remedy sought and have espoused a more eclectic view of the standards that serve to characterize the essential 
nature of a cause of action in giving meaning and scope to the right to a jury trial conferred by article I, paragraph 9 of the New 
Jersey Constitution”]; Insurance Financial Services, Inc. v. South Carolina Ins. Co. (1978) 271 S.C. 289 [247 S.E.2d 315, 
318] [“Since the appellant has prayed for money damages in addition to seeking equitable relief, characterization of the action as 
equitable or legal depends on the appellant's ‘main purpose’ in bringing the action”]; Norback v. Bd. of Directors of Church 
Extension Society (1934) 84 Utah 506 [37 P.2d 339, 345] [“If the issues are legal or the major issues legal, either party is entitled 
upon proper demand to a jury trial; but, if the issues are equitable or the major issues to be resolved by an application of equity, 
the legal issues being merely subsidiary, the action should be regarded as equitable and the rules of equity apply”]; Brown v. 
Safeway Stores (1980) 94 Wn.2d 359 [617 P.2d 704, 709] [“In determining whether a case is primarily equitable in nature or is 
an action at law, the trial court is accorded wide discretion [which] should be exercised with reference to a variety of factors 
including, but not necessarily limited to, [seven factors set forth in an earlier Washington decision]”]; Hyatt Bros. ex rel. Hyatt v. 
Hyatt (Wyo. 1989) 769 P.2d 329, 333 [“the right to a jury trial in cases involving mixed issues of law and equity [is] resolved by 
examining the entire pleadings and all the issues raised to determine whether the action is primarily legal in nature or primarily 
equitable in nature”].) "
1527,25," In its answer brief filed in this court, Nationwide maintains that if this court rejects its state constitutional claim, we should 
address the question whether it has a right to a jury trial under the Sixth or Seventh Amendment to the United States 
Constitution and should hold, notwithstanding the absence of federal decisional support, that it has a right to jury trial in a state 
court action under those federal provisions. The Court of Appeal did not address these issues, neither the petition for review nor 
any answer to the petition raised these issues, and thus we decline to address those issues. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 
8.516(b)(1).) "
1528,1," Despite what the term “gist” might otherwise call to mind, the aim of this inquiry is not to identify a single essential element at 
the action's theoretical core. We instead try to understand how the statutory cause of action, considered as a whole, relates to 
the historical division between law and equity, the goal being to place the cause of action appropriately among its possible 
historical analogues. I do not believe federal law differs a great deal on this basic point. Though the majority reads Tull as establishing a strict rule that 
the plea for a legal remedy carries a jury trial right notwithstanding any other substantial equitable characteristics the action 
might have (maj. opn., ante, at pp. 330–331), I do not read Tull this way. The high court's case law has long made clear that the 
federal jury trial inquiry turns on a holistic examination of both “the nature of the action and of the remedy sought”—a rule Tull 
cited without signaling any intent to depart from it. (Tull, supra, 481 U.S. at p. 417; see also id. at p. 422, fn. 6 [“Our search is for 
a single historical analog, taking into consideration the nature of the cause of action and the remedy as two important factors.”]; 
accord, e.g., Feltner v. Columbia Pictures Television, Inc. (1998) 523 U.S. 340, 348 [140 L.Ed.2d 438, 118 S.Ct. 1279] [7th 
Amend. to the U.S. Const. intended to apply to actions “‘in which legal rights were to be ascertained and determined’” (italics 
omitted & added)].) In any event, Tull is distinguishable from this case on other, more case-specific grounds, which I discuss later in this opinion. We 
need not rely here on any broad generalizations about how, if at all, the federal approach to the civil jury right differs from 
California's. "
1529,2," The majority discusses the equitable character of the UCL and the FAL in detail only in part III of the opinion, which addresses 
statutory jury trial rights. The majority concludes there that in enacting and amending both statutes, “the legislative history and 
legislative purpose of both statutes convincingly establish that the Legislature intended that such causes of action under these 
statutes would be tried by the court, exercising the traditional flexible discretion and judicial expertise of a court of equity … .” 
(Maj. opn., ante, at p. 297.) In its constitutional analysis, the majority simply cross-references this discussion. (Id. at p. 326.) 
Readers should not be confused, however, by this organizational choice: The Legislature's intent does not control whether there 
is a constitutional right to jury trial. (See id. at p. 314.)"
1529,3," Business and Professions Code section 17500 defines the scope of false advertising liability: “It is unlawful for any person … 
with intent directly or indirectly to dispose of real or personal property or to perform services … to make or disseminate or cause 
to be made or disseminated before the public … any statement, concerning that real or personal property or those services … 
which is untrue or misleading, and which is known, or which by the exercise of reasonable care should be known, to be untrue or 
misleading, or for any person … to so make … any such statement as part of a plan or scheme with the intent not to sell that 
personal property or those services, professional or otherwise, so advertised at the price stated therein, or as so advertised.” "
1531,4," The FTC Guides on testimonials and endorsements, for example, simply “provide the basis for voluntary compliance with the 
law by advertisers and endorsers.” (16 C.F.R. § 255.0(a) (2020); see also id., § 260.1(a) (2019) [Guides on environmental claims 
“help marketers avoid making environmental marketing claims that are unfair or deceptive,” but “do not operate to bind the FTC 
or the public.”]; FTC v. Mary Carter Paint Co. (1965) 382 U.S. 46, 47–48 [15 L.Ed.2d 128, 86 S.Ct. 219] [“These, of course, were 
guides, not fixed rules as such, and were designed to inform businessmen of the factors which would guide Commission 
decision.”].) And while the Stern treatise describes some of the FTC Guides as potentially relevant to FAL liability, it gives no 
examples of their use by courts for this purpose and does not describe such use as common. (See Stern, Cal. Practice Guide: 
Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200 Practice, supra, ¶¶ 4:46, 4:72, 4:80.2–4:80.4, pp. 4-14, 4-32.)"
1531,5," The same is true of the cited federal decisions upholding FTC findings of deceptiveness (maj. opn., ante, at p. 313), such as 
FTC v. Colgate-Palmolive Co. (1965) 380 U.S. 374, 384–390 [13 L.Ed.2d 904, 85 S.Ct. 1035] and FTC v. Mary Carter Paint Co., 
supra, 382 U.S. at pages 47 to 48: They may show that deceptiveness can be factually complicated, but not that it depends on 
application of equitable principles. "
1540,1," When quoting cases, unless otherwise noted, all citations and quotation marks are omitted and all alterations are adopted. "
1546,2," Not to mention that, as perhaps one of the clearest signs of the anti-competitive nature of the credit card market, there ""has 
been no successful entry into the [credit card] market since Discover in 1985""—more than three decades ago. (Compl. ¶ 38.) "
1548,3," Amex argues that Plaintiffs have not alleged a direct injury and instead present only a so-called umbrella theory of liability. 
(Mem. at 11-13.) The Second Circuit has not yet explicitly addressed the viability of antitrust claims that rely on an umbrella 
theory of liability, but it has expressed concerns about allowing such claims to proceed. See Gelboim, 823 F.3d at 779 (noting 
that allowing claims under an umbrella theory of liability could ""vastly extend the potential scope of antitrust liability"" and could 
allow recovery for ""damages disproportionate to wrongdoing.""). Because the court holds that Plaintiffs are not efficient enforcers 
under the AGC factors, it need not rule on whether an umbrella theory of liability may ever create antitrust standing (or if 
umbrella standing concerns alone should determine that Plaintiffs are not efficient enforcers). "
1550,4," These jurisdictions are: Alabama, Arizona, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, 
Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Ohio, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Utah, Vermont, West 
Virginia, and Wisconsin. (Mem. at 15.) "
1553,5," Dairy Farmers, upon which Amex relies, rejected Teague for what it called its ""sometimes-dubious and often-difficult-to-follow 
analysis,"" and chose to rely on an earlier trial court decision in finding that North Carolina courts would apply the AGC factors. 
Dairy Farmers, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 84152, 2015 WL 3988488, at *15. HN16[
] Yet, a federal court's view that a state 
appellate court decision is wrongly decided (or would lead to results with which the federal court would disagree) is not grounds 
for the federal court to ignore the state court's ruling."
1553,6," Amex cites Dicesare for the proposition that, because the North Carolina Supreme Court ""has not spoken on the means . . . by 
which state courts are to distinguish those indirect purchasers who have sustained actual injuries from those who have "
1554,," sustained injuries that are too remote or attenuated to warrant relief,"" state courts in North Carolina ""may still consider the AGC 
factors."" (Reply at 7 n.7 (quoting Dicesare, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 33, 2017 WL 1359599, at *12).) This is not an accurate 
representation of Dicesare. Dicesare notes that the state's ""Court of Appeals expressly held that the AGC factors do not apply in 
determining which indirect purchasers have standing to sue under the North Carolina antitrust statues."" Dicesare, 2017 NCBC 
LEXIS 33, 2017 WL 1359599, at *11. The court goes on to note that ""antitrust cases—especially those involving indirect 
purchasers—will often involve complicated causation and damages issues,"" and that the state's Supreme Court ""has not spoken 
on this precise complex issue."" Id. Recognizing the potential burdens and costs faced by the parties should the case continue to 
discovery and the importance of this issue to the state as a whole, Dicesare welcomed state Supreme Court review of its 
decision, noting that it would exercise its discretion to stay further proceedings should the state Supreme Court take up the 
issue. Id. Contrary to Amex's representation, however, nowhere in this part of its analysis does the court mention the AGC 
factors, let alone hold (or even suggest) that the state Supreme Court's silence on this issue meant that ""state courts may still 
consider the AGC factors."" (Reply at 7 n.7.) To the contrary, Dicesare discusses the AGC factors twice: first in the context of 
Teague's ""controlling"" holding that the AGC factors do not apply to determinations of standing under the North Carolina antitrust 
statutes, and second in the context of an earlier Superior Court case that applied a ""modified"" version of AGC, which Teague 
rejected. See Dicesare, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 33, 2017 WL 1359599, at *11-12. "
1555,7," HN20[
] In lieu of the AGC factors, traditional constitutional standing principles apply. A party has standing to sue under 
Tennessee law when it meets the minimum constitutional requirements of standing under federal law. See, e.g., In re Petition of 
Youngblood, 895 S.W.2d 322, 326 (Tenn. 1995) (adopting federal constitutional standard); Cox v. Shell Oil Co., 196 S.W.3d 
747, 757-58 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2005) (state law standing ""parallels the constitutional restriction on federal court jurisdiction to 
'cases and controversies'""). As discussed above, Plaintiffs meet that baseline constitutional standard."
1555,8," Amex argues that Plaintiffs' claim ""is not an indirect purchaser claim,"" but ""[r]ather, Plaintiffs allege that merchants passed 
some portion of alleged overcharges from credit card fees to consumers through increased prices on some unknown portion of 
goods sold and services rendered. This [c]ourt would need to track overcharges on countless items—paid by consumers with no 
relationship to Amex whatsoever, to merchants who may or may not accept Amex."" (Mem. at 18.) Yet, the Tennessee Supreme 
Court has explicitly rejected the concerns Amex raises of complex damage assessment and fear of multiple liability as relevant 
to a standing analysis under TTPA (even though they are central to the AGC analysis)."
1555,9," Amex describes the claims brought under the laws of these four states as Plaintiffs' ""remaining state consumer protection law 
claims"" (Mem. at 18), likely assuming that the claims brought under the consumer protection laws of the states in which no 
named Plaintiff is a resident must be dismissed. However, as discussed supra, Langan compels the opposite result. Therefore, 
Plaintiffs' claims under the consumer protection laws of District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Montana, New Hampshire, Ohio, 
and Rhode Island survive Amex's motion. "
1556,10," Amex cites to the federal district court opinion Cash Energy Inc. v. Weiner, but that case is distinguishable. (Mem. at 20 (citing 
Cash Energy, Inc. v. Weiner, 768 F. Supp. 892, 894 (D. Mass. 1991)).) Cash involved landowners bringing suit against 
defendants who had stored chemical solvents on an adjacent property that had allegedly contaminated plaintiffs' property. Cash, 
768 F. Supp. at 893. The court dismissed plaintiffs' claim under the CBPA, holding that plaintiffs and defendants did not have 
""some transactional business relationship"" as required by the CBPA. Id. at 894. Here, by contrast, Plaintiffs are not neighboring 
landowners with a dispute sounding in common law, but, accordingly to Plaintiffs, are participants in the same ""two-sided 
market"" as Defendants. At this stage, those allegations are sufficient—especially in light of the CBPA's ""broad impact"" and ""clear 
statement of legislative policy to protect consumers,"" Ciardi, 436 Mass. at 59, 65, factors that were not implicated in Cash. "
1557,11," The complaint alleges claims for damages under the ""law of unjust enrichment of thirty-two jurisdictions."" (Compl. ¶ 138.) 
However, Plaintiffs argue in their brief that the court should apply New York law to their unjust enrichment claim, and Amex did 
not contest application of New York law in its reply. (Opp. at 23-25; Reply at 10.) Because HN27[
] ""implied consent is 
sufficient to establish choice of law,"" Krumme v. WestPoint Stevens, Inc., 238 F.3d 133, 138 (2d Cir. 2000), the court applies 
New York law. "
1560,1," Christopher Bryant's deposition was the only evidence Defendant submitted in support of its Motion. Plaintiff submitted no 
evidence to oppose the Motion. "
1561,2," Although the claim fails, it notable that Plaintiff is less than forthcoming about its purported damages. Plaintiff argues that 
Defendant required it to place a $50,000 order of non-closeout items ""[a]round June 2017 . . . to maintain its favorable pricing,"" 
and that it would have been impossible to sell those goods before Defendant prohibited Plaintiff from selling through third-party 
retailers in April 2018. (Pl.'s Opp'n Mem. at 3.) But Bryant testified that Defendant did not force Plaintiff to make the purchase 
and no contractual provision required it to do so. (Bryant Dep. at 201.) Further, Bryant did not know if Plaintiff's remaining 
inventory contained the goods obtained in the $50,000 purchase. (Id. at 183.) Plaintiff cannot now claim the $50,000 purchase 
as damages. Additionally, Plaintiff cites a $153,463 purchase of closeout products in June 2017. (Pl.'s Opp'n Mem. at 9.) But Plaintiff is silent 
as to Defendant's contention that before litigation commenced, Defendant offered to buy back the closeout goods and give 
Plaintiff an additional $10,000. (Bryant Dep. at 186-87.) "
1564,1," In their briefs, both parties collectively referrer to Plaintiffs as ""UAS."" This Report and Recommendation follows the parties' 
approach. "
1566,2," As this case is at the motion-to-dismiss stage, all of UAS's well-pleaded facts must be accepted as true. See Part III, infra. "
1567,3," Parkland was originally a party to this lawsuit, but the claims against it were resolved by joint motion last year (See Docket 
Entries 95. 96.) "
1572,4," UAS has moved the Court for leave to tile its Third Amended Complaint. (See Docket Entry 119.) That motion, which is 
opposed by Superior and Centene, will he addressed by separate order."
1572,5," The Texas Antitrust Act is interpreted in harmony with federal interpretation of the Sherman Act. See Caller-Times Pub. Co. v. 
Triad Commc'ns, Inc.. 826 S.W.2d 576. 580 (Tex. 1992). "
1573,6," In its motion, Superior alternatively contends that UAS's tortious interference claims are actually subject to only a one-year 
statute of limitations because they are based on defamatory conduct. (Docket Entry 116, at 13; Docket Entry 129. at 5 n.4.) This 
contention fails. Tortious interference claims are subject to a one-year limitations period only when defamatory conduct forms 
the sole basis for the complaint. Nationwide Bi-Weekly Admin. Inc. v. Belo Corp., 512 F. 3d 137, 147 (5th Cir. 2007). Because 
UAS's tortious interference claims are based not only defamatory conduct but also on denial of reimbursement claims (see 
Docket Entry 106, at 44-45). the one-year statute of limitations is inapplicable."
1573,7," While UAS's response makes a conclusory reference to ""more recent"" acts against providers at Amarillo Pediatrics and Dr. 
Hashim, these alleged acts are not included in the second amended complaint. (See Docket Entry 125, at 20.) "
1574,8," In its proposed Third Amended Complaint, UAS avers that ""the earliest time any of the aforementioned causes of action would 
accrue is in 2016, where a glimpse of the wrongdoing behind Superior's allergy policy was discovered via its responses to a 
subpoena in different litigation, including the 2016 corporate representative deposition of Dr. Glomb pursuant to that subpoena."" 
(Docket Entry 119-3, at 55.) These additional ""filets"" are not before the Court in the present motion to dismiss; even if they were, 
they appear insufficiently specific to satisfy the particularity requirements of Rule 9(b)."
1574,9," As already noted, see n.5, supra, the Texas Act mirrors federal antitrust law, and Texas courts ""are statutorily instructed to 
interpret the [Texas Act] in harmony with federal judicial interpretations of equivalent federal laws."" Apani Sir., Inc. v. Coca-Cola 
Ewer., Inc., 300 F.3d 620, 628 (5th Cir. 2002.) Therefore, resolution of the question of whether UAS has stated a claim under the 
Sherman Act also determines the survival of his Texas Act claims. "
1592,1," The named plaintiffs are 1199SEIU National Benefit Fund; 1199SEIU Greater New York Benefit Fund; 1199SEIU National 
Benefit Fund for Home Care Workers; 1199SEIU Licensed Practical Nurses Welfare Fund; American Federation of State, 
County, and Municipal Employees District Council 37 Health and Security Plan; Fraternal Order of Police, Miami Lodge 20, 
Insurance Trust Fund; Ironworkers Local 383 Health Care Plan; Self-Insured Schools of California; Sergeants Benevolent 
Association Health & Welfare Fund; St. Paul Electrical Workers' Health Plan; and United Food and Commercial Workers Unions 
and Employers Midwest Health Benefits Fund. "
1593,2," In addition to EPPs, the litigation includes other groups of plaintiffs. While the motion for class certification of the Direct 
Purchaser Plaintiffs (""DPPs"") was pending, they announced that they and Allergan had agreed to a class settlement which 
awaits the court's approval. Another group of plaintiffs—referred to as the Retailer Plaintiffs—are DPPs who, in effect, opted out 
of the class action and also recently reached a settlement with Allergan. Finally, three entities proceeding as assignees of claims 
held by indirect purchasers—MSP Recovery Claims, Series LLC; MSPA Claims 1, LLC; and MAO-MSO Recovery II, LLC, 
Series PMPI—jointly filed a complaint in this court on May 3, 2019. These plaintiffs and defendant agreed to stay that action until 
I issue a ruling on EPPs' class certification motion. "
1594,3," EPPs also brought claims for injunctive relief under the Clayton Act and for declaratory relief under the Sherman Act. They 
withdrew these federal claims in their class certification motion. This court retains jurisdiction over this action under the Class 
Action Fairness Act of 2005, which grants federal district courts original jurisdiction over ""any civil action in which [] the matter 
in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $5,000,000, exclusive of interest and costs, and is a class action in which . . . any 
member of a class of plaintiffs is a citizen of a State different from any defendant."" 28 U.S.C. § 1332(d)(2)."
1594,4," Plaintiffs originally sought certification of a class period that begins on May 17, 2014, the date the Restasis patents expired. But 
EPPs clarified at oral argument that the class period should begin on May 1, 2015, as a result of the conclusions of one of their 
merits experts that a reasonable date for generic entry would have been in May 2015. "
1596,5," EPPs and DPPs submitted, with their respective class certification motions, proposed trial plans, both of which contemplated 
joint trials. On September 25, 2019, I ordered EPPs, DPPs, and Retailer Plaintiffs to meet and confer about their plans and to 
provide additional detail as to how they intend to try their cases to avoid inconsistent verdicts. The plaintiffs then jointly submitted 
a plan proposing bifurcated trials at which all plaintiffs would present, to one jury, common evidence to show that Allergan 
violated the laws at issue and delayed the entry of generic Restasis. Next, depending on the jury's findings, there would be 
separate trials on impact and damages. The plaintiffs proposed bifurcation to satisfy Hanover Shoe, Inc. v. United Shoe Mach. 
Corp., 392 U.S. 481, 491-94, 88 S. Ct. 2224, 20 L. Ed. 2d 1231 (1968), which prohibits the admission at a direct purchaser trial 
of evidence that they may have passed on their overcharges to other parties, including end-payors. Retailer Plaintiffs have 
settled and, assuming I approve DPPs' proposed settlement, I expect EPPs to adjust their trial plan accordingly."
1596,6," HN5[
] In an antitrust case alleging overcharges, the typical measure of damage is the difference between the price that was 
actually charged and the price that a consumer would have been charged in the but-for world. In re Rail Freight Fuel Surcharge 
Antitrust Litig., 292 F. Supp. 3d 14, 101 (D.C.C. 2017), aff'd, 934 F.3d 619, 443 U.S. App. D.C. 86 (D.C. Cir. 2019)."
1596,7," Ms. Craft is the president of OnPoint Analytics, Inc., which provides data analytics for complex litigation. In many antitrust class 
actions, including those involving the pharmaceutical industry, she has developed databases of discrete transactions from 
multiple data sources, and she has used them to identify and remove class members who were uninjured or subject to specific 
exclusions. Although defendant does not challenge her credentials, I note that a court recently denied a motion to exclude Ms. Craft's 
opinion. See In re Loestrin 24 Fe Antitrust Litig., 410 F. Supp. 3d 352, 386 (D.R.I. 2019) (""[Ms. Craft] is highly experienced in 
pharmaceutical data management and compilation for complex litigation. She has worked closely - and managed those working "
1597,," closely - with pharmaceutical sales, marketing, and reimbursement data. The Court thus is convinced that she is knowledgeable 
about the types of data available, their presentation and formatting, and their use in analytical applications.""). "
1598,8," Although EPPs raise only state law claims, the parties analyze the elements of a federal antitrust claim. This is because the 
state antitrust statutes generally adopt these same elements and require proof of injury-in-fact and damages—the elements at 
issue here. Below I separately address Allergan's arguments that differences in the state statutes cause individual issues to 
predominate. Defendant also asserts that ""[i]njury or impact"" is an element of all of EPPs' consumer protection and unjust enrichment claims. 
EPPs have not argued otherwise, and thus I will assume for purposes of this motion that Allergan is correct. "
1599,9," Dr. Frank measured damages from February 2016 (when he assumed for purposes of his analysis a generic would have 
entered in the but-for world) to January 2019 (the last month for which he had data). His methodology can be adjusted to reflect 
the damages period found by the jury. For TPPs and insured customers, Xalatan's generic penetration rate was 92.2 percent after six months, 96.3 percent after 12 
months, and 97.8 percent after two years. For cash payors, the generic penetration rate was 89.2 percent after six months, 91.9 
percent after 12 months, and 94.8 percent after two years. These penetration rates are consistent with the rates observed in the 
industry as a whole. "
1600,10," Allergan refers to these people as ""brand loyalists."" But, as Ms. Craft explained, powerful institutional factors, which are 
unrelated to a consumer's preference for a particular brand, drive brand retention rates. I will thus use the term ""brand retention"" 
instead of ""brand loyalty."""
1600,11," In its petition for certiorari, the employer, Tyson Foods, asked the Court to decide, among other things, ""whether a class may 
be certified if it contains members who were not injured and have no legal right to any damages."" Id. at 1049 (internal quotation 
marks omitted). But, in its merits brief, Tyson Foods conceded that federal courts had the authority to certify such a class. Id. "
1601,12," I also reject defendant's claim that Denney v. Deutsche Bank AG, 443 F.3d 253, 264 (2d Cir. 2006), which held that a class 
must be defined to ensure that all class members have Article III standing, shows that the Second Circuit does not permit 
certification of a class containing uninjured members. HN15[
] To satisfy Article III standing, a class member must have been 
affected in a personal and individual way, but the member ""'need not be capable of sustaining a valid cause of action.'"" 
Dubuisson v. Stonebridge Life Ins. Co., 887 F.3d 567, 574 (2d Cir. 2018) (quoting Denney, 443 F.3d at 264). Here, because they 
purchased Restasis, all class members have standing—whether or not they paid an overcharge. See Torres, 835 F.3d at 1137 
n.6 (clarifying that Denney's holding ""signifies only that it must be possible that class members have suffered injury, not that they 
did suffer injury, or that they must prove such injury at the certification phase""). Notably, the Asacol Court found Article III 
standing satisfied there. 907 F.3d at 50-51."
1601,13," The parties' experts disagree over the extent of the price differential, but that question will be resolved by the jury through the 
use of common evidence. "
1602,14," Defendant contests Dr. Frank's assertion that the percentage of patients remaining on the brand after generic entry would be 
lower than the percentage of brand prescriptions. Dr. Frank deemed Restasis a chronic condition, citing one study that listed the 
median duration of treatment as 23 months. Allergan claims that Dr. Frank misconstrued the facts, that the study he cites 
described a small set of people with an incurable eye disease, and that less than a quarter of patients remain on Restasis after 
12 months. At oral argument, defendant also asserted that most consumers using the brand drug at the time of generic entry 
would have remained on the brand rather than switch to the generic. I need not resolve this dispute, as I find that class 
certification is appropriate even if 5.7 percent of consumers were uninjured. But I do note that defendant's own experts, whose 
expertise treating dry-eye disease EPPs have not challenged, testified that the disease ""needs to be treated chronically,"" see 
Class Cert. Hr'g Tr. at 82 (Dr. Hatch), and that Restasis is ""a lifelong treatment regimen,"" id. at 292 (Dr. Mandadakis). "
1603,15," Plaintiffs, through Ms. Craft's rebuttal report, offer a critique of this view. According to Ms. Craft, ""the number of simultaneous 
generics may affect price discounts,"" but ""its effect on the brand retention rate is not well established."" Rebuttal Declaration of 
Laura R. Craft in Support of End-Payor Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification (""Craft Reb."") ¶ 74. According to her, ""[t]he 
institutional mechanisms that drive generic adoption"" can cause rapid generic penetration even with only one generic entrant. 
Craft Reb. ¶ 75."
1603,16," The exact contours of Xalatan's generic entry are not clear from the parties' submissions. According to Dr. Frank, there were 
initially five generic entrants, but the sales for two of them were small and quickly diminished to minimal level, so that the 
remaining three generic entrants accounted for 85 percent to nearly 100 percent of generic sales during the first two years. But, 
in a declaration submitted in the Restasis patent infringement litigation, David LeCause, Allergan's Vice President of U.S. Eye 
Care Sales, stated that four generics initially entered. Despite this confusion, at oral argument, counsel for both sides agreed 
that, for practical purposes, there were initially three generic entrants and a fourth entrant 18 months later."
1603,17," According to Dr. Frank, when adjusted to account for mail-order prescriptions, Restasis' sales were approximately $1.8 billion 
that year."
1603,18," Dr. Frank relied on these same factors to respond to defendant's criticism of his decision not to use as an analog Allergan's 
ophthalmic drug Alphagan P, which had only one generic entrant and higher brand retention than Xalatan. Dr. Frank explained 
that, in 2009, the year before Alphagan P lost exclusivity, its retail sales were only $188.8 million."
1603,19," I have excluded the challenged portions of defendant's other two witnesses, Dr. Hatch and Dr. Mandadakis. As I note in the 
Daubert Decision, however, even if I had found these experts' opinions admissible, they would not alter my decision on class 
certification."
1603,20," Although Dr. Hughes regularly serves as a defense witness in generic delay antitrust litigation, he has not published articles 
relevant to this topic. "
1604,21," I have excluded the names of these companies as confidential. However, this opinion reveals some facts about Allergan or 
third parties that Allergan has requested that I seal. See Motion to Redact and Seal Certain Documents Related to End-Payor 
Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification, Dkt. No. 456. Where it does so, it is because I have determined that the public's right—
under the common law and the First Amendment—to understand the basis of my conclusions on a crucial motion in this litigation 
substantially outweighs the factors that favor sealing. See Brown v. Maxwell, 929 F.3d 41, 47-51 (2d Cir. 2019); Joy v. North, 
692 F.2d 880, 893 (2d Cir. 1982); Liberty Re (Bermuda) Ltd. v. Transamerica Occidental Life Ins. Co., 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
9774, 2005 WL 1216292, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. May 23, 2005)."
1604,22," At oral argument, EPPs' counsel asserted that Company B's representative confirmed that the company forecasted three initial 
entrants and a fourth six months later."

Current Valuation, June 24, 2013. "
1605,24," It is also possible that, in the but-for world, Allergan may have tried to retain more of the market by introducing its own generic 
version of Restasis—that is, an ""authorized generic."" According to Dr. Frank, 68 percent of drugs with high sales include an 
authorized generic at generic entry. One of Xalatan's generic entrants was an authorized one."
1605,25," It is noteworthy that, on average, these generic manufacturers predicted a brand retention rate that was significantly lower 
than that predicted by Dr. Hughes, who relied exclusively on single forecasts created by each of two companies."
1605,26," One piece of evidence cited by Dr. Hughes fails to make this critical distinction. Dr. Hughes wrote that ""brand loyalty"" is 
especially high for ophthalmic products in part because ""the design of the bottle and eyedropper are very important for 
ophthalmic drugs, especially with regards to ease of use and precision of the quantity dispensed."" Hughes Rep. ¶ 82. He cited 
an article in which an ophthalmologist, after asserting that the design of the bottle and eyedropper could make a generic drug 
less user-friendly, described the packaging of generic Xalatan products as an example. Dr. Yvonne Ou, Glaucoma Eye Drops: Is 
There a Difference Between Brand Name and Generic, Bright Focus Foundation, Mar. 24, 2017 (""Ou Article""), "
1606,," www.brightfocus.org/glaucoma/article/glaucoma-eye-drops-there-difference-between-brand-name-and-generic. 
This 
article's 
reference to Xalatan, of course, undercuts Dr. Hughes' claim that concerns about a generic's inferior packaging could impede 
the drug's rapid and effective penetration of the market. Defendant also cites a study of Medicare Part D recipients that found that, in 2013, eye care providers prescribed brand drugs to 
Medicare patients at the highest rate relative to all other physician specialties. Dr. Paula A. Newman-Casey, et al., Brand 
Medications and Medicare Part D: How Eye Care Providers' Prescribing Patterns Influence Costs, 125 Ophthalmology 332 
(2018), www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov./pmc/articles/PMC5732892. The authors did not determine the precise reasons for the difference, 
although they did acknowledge, among other possibilities, some doctors' concerns about the efficacy of generic drugs. They also 
noted, however, that brand medications' ""[h]igh costs result in less frequent medication purchases and lead to lower medication 
adherence,"" citing a study of 8,427 patients with open-angle glaucoma who were 39 percent more likely to have reduced 
medication adherence if they were prescribed the brand name drug. Id. The authors deemed it ""likely critically important to 
prescribe less expensive [generic] medications as first-line therapies to help decrease the risk of cost-related medication 
nonadherence."" Id. The Ou Article similarly acknowledged that the ""[d]ecreased cost of glaucoma drops has been shown to 
increase adherence, or compliance with taking a medication as prescribed."" "
1607,27," I note that defendant's argument appears contingent on a finding that the brand retention rate would be higher than that 
predicted by Dr. Frank—a finding I have not made. Notably, the district court in Asacol concluded that the rate there would have 
been 10 percent. 907 F.3d at 45. I will nevertheless address defendant's argument, in part because it is not obvious that the 
Asacol Court's holding would have differed if that Court had been faced with a lower percentage of uninjured class members."
1607,28," EPPs' model distinguishes this case from two cited by defendant, Jensen v. Cablevision Sys. Corp., 372 F. Supp. 3d 95, 129 
(E.D.N.Y. 2019), and Vaccariello v. XM Satellite Radio, Inc., 295 F.R.D. 62, 74 (S.D.N.Y. 2013), in which the district courts 
denied class certification due, in part, to the need for individualized inquiries to determine whether each class member was 
injured. The plaintiffs in those cases, unlike EPPs, did not offer a method of classwide proof to separate uninjured class 
members from those who were injured. "
1608,29," Allergan insists that it will challenge each plaintiff in the claims process to assure that no uninjured plaintiff receives an award. 
There are two responses to this. Realistically, the likelihood that Allergan would choose to undertake the time and expense to 
challenge each plaintiff is remote. This is because any award against it, having already been reduced by the percentage of 
uninjured plaintiffs found by the jury, will not change. If it nonetheless chooses this path, it may effectively use the affidavit 
process to cull those plaintiffs it wishes to challenge. "
1609,30," Allergan also relies on the D.C. Circuit's recent decision in Rail Freight, 934 F.3d at 620, which affirmed the district court's 
denial, on remand, of class certification because the class contained too many uninjured members. Although the D.C. Circuit 
cited Asacol with approval, see id. at 624, 627, the plaintiffs' model in Rail Freight was different from that in Asacol as well as 
from EPPs'. The plaintiffs in Rail Freight ""insist[ed] that each member of the proposed class was injured,"" even though their own 
expert's model found that over 2,000 class members were not. Id. at 623-24. Thus, unlike here, the plaintiffs had not proposed a 
method to remove uninjured plaintiffs through common evidence, leaving the D.C. Circuit to conclude that it must be done 
through ""full-blown, individual trials."" Id. at 625."
1609,31," Defendant unpersuasively argues that EPPs' proposed methodology to show classwide impact is prohibited by the Supreme 
Court's decision in Wal-Mart. But there is no basis to compare the proposed class here to the class in Wal-Mart of 1.5 million 
female employees alleging employment discrimination in 3,400 stores. 564 U.S. at 357. The Court there found that Rule 23(a)'s 
lenient commonality requirement was not met as there was not even a single common question. Id. at 359. And it rejected the 
use of ""sample cases"" to extrapolate the percentage of women who were discriminated against by their local supervisors. See 
id. at 348, 357-58. Dr. Frank's use in this case of a market yardstick to show classwide impact in the but-for world bears no 
resemblance to the ""trial by formula"" condemned in Wal-Mart. See id. at 367. "
1610,32," It also claims that the lack of a generic Restasis prevents the parties from examining ""[o]ne of the factors that will likely drive 
especially high brand loyalty rates here [-] each patient's idiosyncratic medical issues, such as the likelihood that a patient would 
experience side effects and/or efficacy problems with the generic and their likely response if they experienced such side effects."" 
Id. But a class member who experienced side effects from a generic would still be injured because he or she paid at least one 
overcharge. See, e.g., In re Nexium, 777 F.3d at 27."
1610,33," At oral argument, Allergan contended that the continued absence of a generic entrant weighs against class certification 
because it evidences the weakness of plaintiffs' case. But the overall strength of plaintiffs' case is not relevant to class 
certification. See, e.g., In re Initial Pub. Offerings Secs. Litig., 471 F.3d 24, 41 (2d Cir. 2006) (""a district judge should not assess 
any aspect of the merits unrelated to a Rule 23 requirement"")."
1610,34," Defendant further argues that, even if a generic enters the market during this litigation, consumers' purchasing decisions 
would likely still provide insufficient data to show what they would have done in the but-for world. It is true that whether a 
consumer purchased a generic version of Restasis in the actual world is not open-and-shut proof that he or she would have 
done the same in the but-for world. But this data nonetheless would provide insight into his or her actions in the but-for world. 
See In re Flonase, 284 F.R.D. at 222; In re Cardizem CD Antitrust Litig., 200 F.R.D. 326, 343 (E.D. Mich. 2001). "
1611,35," Ms. Craft and Dr. Frank both initially estimated that the percentage of individuals covered by employer-sponsored prescription 
drug plans that have flat copayments was 0.32. But, adjusting for numbers cited by Dr. Hughes in his report, Ms. Craft increased 
the percentage to 0.4 percent in her rebuttal report. This percentage may be a slight underestimate as it does not include 
individuals covered by Medicaid or by health insurance that is not sponsored by an employer. "
1613,36, Dr. Frank's assertion that TPPs bore about 90 percent of the class' overcharges is uncontested.
1613,37," Defendant's reliance on Minpeco, S.A. v. Conticommodity Servs., Inc., 676 F. Supp. 486, 488-90 (S.D.N.Y. 1987), to argue 
otherwise is not persuasive, as that case holds only that damages offsets should be accounted for in the ultimate assessment of 
damages, not that the existence of these offsets renders a party uninjured in the first place. The same can be said about 
Abrahamson v. Fleschner, 568 F.2d 862, 878-79 (2d Cir. 1977), another case cited by Allergan, which addressed the measure 
of damages under the Investment Advisors Act of 1940. Consistent with these cases, Dr. Frank subtracted rebates from his 
calculation of TPPs' damages. "
1614,38," Dr. Hughes also criticized EPPs' failure to exclude from the class insurers who function in an Administrative Services Only 
(ASO) capacity. As their name indicates, ASOs solely administer health plans on behalf of a health insurer; they do not pay for 
the drugs themselves. While Dr. Hughes does not assert otherwise, he claims the contractual relationships between TPPs and 
ASOs would cause various administrative difficulties, requiring individualized inquiries to determine exactly who is entitled to 
recoup an overcharge. But Dr. Hughes admitted during his hearing testimony that he had offered no specific case in which a 
conflict between a TPP and ASO may arise. I trust that, pursuant to the terms of their agreements, ASOs and TPPs will submit 
proper claims. To the extent they do not, these issues can be addressed during the claims administration process, with the aid of 
the robust data attached to each pharmaceutical transaction. "
1615,39," Dr. Frank calculated damages for two different scenarios in the but-for world—one in which generic products replaced 
prescriptions for Restasis MultiDose (a product Allergan launched in March 2017) and one in which they did not. "
1616,40," Defendant categorizes these slightly differently, classifying Missouri's antitrust statute as a consumer protection law, but that 
does not affect the analysis here. "
1617,41," In its initial briefing, defendant cited more perceived differences between the states' antitrust and consumer protection laws 
than it raises now. At oral argument and in subsequent briefing, defendant has acknowledged that many of the issues it had 
raised to defeat class certification are more appropriate for summary judgment. Therefore, I do not address them now. "
1618,42," HN35[

1620,45," The facts in Ludke v. Philip Morris Cos., 2001 Minn. Dist. LEXIS 2, 2001 WL 1673791 (Minn. Dist. Ct. Nov. 21, 2001), relied 
upon by Relafen, were similar to those in Keating. "
1621,46," It is also worth noting that many courts have certified end-payor classes containing claims under the laws of Minnesota, 
Michigan, and/or Florida without any discussion of a higher standard of individual impact. See, e.g., Hosp. Auth. of Metro. Gov't 
of Nashville and Davidson County, Tenn. v. Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 333 F.R.D. 390, 2019 WL 4573433 (M.D. Tenn.

(S.D. Fla. 2004). Indeed, in In re Nexium, 297 F.R.D. at 175, the very judge who wrote the decision in Relafen, did precisely that. "
1633,1," Defendants point out that Plaintiffs allege in the Consolidated FAC that the Google Assistant is an ""electronic communication

First of all, Plaintiffs are entitled to plead claims in the alternative: Plaintiffs may have pleaded that SCA claim in the event the 
Wiretap Act claim was found to be precluded by the ordinary course of business exception. Besides, the Court is not required to 
accept the purely legal conclusion offered by the allegation. "

1657,1, Omilia's answer labeled this claim as Count 20. Docket No. 44 at 68.
1657,2," Omilia argues that the Court may reasonably infer that, given Nuance's 70% international market share, Nuance's market share 
within the United States is at least 70%. See Dkt. No. 80 at 44 (motion hearing transcript). "
1670,1, The Court has implemented the parties' proposed redactions in substantial part.

1673,4," Aya disputes that AMN's market share [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] as shown by an SIA report because [TEXT 
REDACTED BY THE COURT]. See id. This dispute, however, is not material since the market share is measured nationally, 
while Aya's proposed geographic markets for its federal antitrust claims are regional. See Doc. No. 37 ¶¶ 331, 360."
1673,5," Aya's fiscal year begins on October 1st of the preceding year and ends on September 30th of the fiscal year in question. For 
example, for Aya's fiscal year 2017, it began on October 1, 2016, and ended on September 30, 2017. See Fitzsimmons Decl., 
Ex. 7 at 45:7-13. "
1674,6," There are two sets of page numbering with respect to Defendants' Exhibit A (Doc. No. 99-3) in support of its Daubert motion. 
The Court's citations refer to the page numbering of the filed exhibit, located directly beneath the page number of the actual 
report. "
1678,7," The Court prioritizes its analysis of Aya's Sherman Act claims because the Court's subject matter jurisdiction hinges on the 
presence of a federal question pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331. In any event, the Court's analysis under the Cartwright Act would 
be the same as the Court's analysis under the Sherman Act. See County of Tuolumne v. Sonora Cmty. Hosp., 236 F.3d 1148, 
1160 (9th Cir. 2001) (citing Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 16700 et seq.). "
1682,8," Aya erroneously cites United States v. eBay, Inc., 968 F. Supp. 2d 1030, 1038-39 (N.D. Cal. 2013), and In re High-Tech Empl. 
Antitrust Litig., 856 F. Supp. 2d 1103, 1122-23 (N.D. Cal. 2012), for the proposition that ""a naked agreement among employers 
not to solicit one another's employees is a per se violation of Section 1."" Opp. at 27. Both cases, confronted with motions to 
dismiss, deferred ruling on whether the per se rule applies until summary judgment. See eBay, 968 F. Supp. 2d at 1039; In re 
High-Tech Empl. Antitrust Litig., 856 F. Supp. 2d at 1122. "
1687,9," Also insufficient is Aya's argument that AMN's trade restraints, when aggregated, have a ""marketwide reach"" that hinder rivals 
from soliciting AMN's employees, AVs, and hospital customers. Opp. at 32. Still, Aya must demonstrate harm to competition, as 
the Court will not give Aya a pass on the requirement. Doing so would inappropriately condemn facially innocuous non-
solicitation provisions as per se illegal under the Sherman Act or inherently anticompetitive. "
1693,*," This summary constitutes no part of the opinion of the court. It has been prepared by court staff for the convenience of the 
reader. "
1696,1," The Power Five conferences are the Atlantic Coast Conference (the ""ACC""), Big Ten Conference, Big 12 Conference, Pacific 
12 Conference (the ""Pac-12""), and Southeastern Conference (the ""SEC""). Student-Athletes named the Power Five as 
defendants, along with Conference USA, the Mid-American Conference (the ""MAC""), Mountain West Conference, Sun Belt 
Conference, Western Athletic Conference, and American Athletic Conference (the ""AAC"")."
1696,2," Athletic participation awards include the ""Senior Scholar-Athlete Award,"" which is a postgraduate scholarship of $10,000 or less 
that institutions may award two student-athletes per year, and awards for achievement in special events, such as all-star or post-
season bowl games."
1696,3," The record indicates that the NCAA does little to regulate or monitor the use of these funds. While it controls the total pool of 
money that an institution may distribute each year, it has not capped the amount that an individual athlete may receive. The SAF 
is broadly available to ""assist student-athletes in meeting financial needs that arise in conjunction with participation in 
intercollegiate athletics, enrollment in an academic curriculum or to recognize academic achievement as determined by 
conference offices."" And the NCAA ""encourage[s]"" schools to allocate AEF funds to provide ""direct benefits to student-athletes 
that enhance [their] welfare."" "
1697,4," Under the Bylaws, student-athletes who have already received Pell Grants (calculated to cover the COA) may also receive 
these stipends."
1697,5," The O'Bannon class included ""[a]ll current and former student-athletes"" who had played D1 men's basketball or FBS football 
""and whose [NILs] may be, or have been, included or could have been included (by virtue of their appearance in a team roster) 
in game footage or in video[]games licensed or sold by Defendants, their co-conspirators, or their licensees."" Id. at 1055-56. "
1698,6," In O'Bannon II, ""amateurism rules"" refers to, inter alia, the NCAA's ""financial aid rules"" and other rules ""that limit student-
athletes' compensation and their interactions with professional sports leagues."" Id. at 1055."
1698,7," I dissented from this vacatur, mostly on the basis of the standard of review, because I concluded that the record supported the 
entirety of the judgment. Id. at 1080. Though agreeing that ""court[s] should not eliminate the distinction between professional 
and college sports,"" I also disagreed that the vacated remedy would have done so. Id. at 1082 n.4. As a practical matter, the 
remedy that survived appeal required nothing of the NCAA, which had already adopted a more generous adjustment to the 
grant-in-aid limit by permitting schools to offer any D1 recruit an athletic scholarship up to the COA, irrespective of whether his or 
her NIL was or could be used or licensed. "
1700,8," This justification is the only one raised on appeal. The district court rejected the NCAA's other proffered justification 
(abandoned on appeal): The challenged rules purportedly enhance student-athletes' college education by integrating them into 
the wider campus community. Id. at 1083-86, 1102-03. The district court declined to find that the challenged rules improve 
academic performance or prevent a social ""wedge"" between athletes and non-athletes. Id. at 1083-85, 1102-03. To the contrary, 
it found that the challenged rules foster resentment by permitting expenditures on ""frills, like extravagant athletes-only facilities."" 
Id. at 1085-86, 1103."
1700,9," The NCAA's ""Principle of Amateurism"" provides that student-athletes'""participation should be motivated primarily by education 
and by the physical, mental and social benefits to be derived,"" that their ""participation in intercollegiate athletics is an avocation,"" 
and that they ""should be protected from exploitation by professional and commercial enterprises."" Id. at 1070 (internal citation 
omitted). "
1702,10," The district court found that the current aggregate limit on such awards is $5,600. Id. at 1072, 1099. "
1705,11," Visa gift cards function like cash, even if the NCAA declines to admit as much."
1705,12," The NCAA characterizes this insurance as a ""legitimate expense to protect against the risk of loss that could be incurred 
during athletic competition,"" but the legitimacy of these payments is irrelevant here. What matters, for stare decisis purposes, is 
that the O'Bannon II panel had no occasion to consider whether such payments accord with the NCAA's conception of 
amateurism."
1705,13," In support of its res judicata argument, the NCAA cites the O'Bannon II majority's discussion of the ""danger"" of ""future 
plaintiffs"" pursuing ""essentially the same claim again and again."" If anything, the cited discussion cuts against the NCAA. The 
majority predicted that future challenges to the district court's $5,000 cap on deferred NIL payments would ultimately result in 
student-athletes, ""captur[ing] the full value of their NIL"" and the NCAA's transformation into a minor league. O'Bannon II, 802 
F.3d at 1079. Far from enshrining the majority's decision as the last word on the legality of NCAA compensation rules, this 
hypothetical rests on the premise that res judicata would not have blocked such challenges. "
1706,14," Writing in support of Student-Athletes, amici assert that courts may not consider a restraint's procompetitive benefits in a 
market outside the market deemed relevant for the purpose of evaluating a restraint's anticompetitive effects. That proposition is 
not settled. See Paladin, 328 F.3d at 1157 n.11 (acknowledging the ""theory that procompetitive effects in a separate market 
cannot justify anticompetitive effects in the market . . . under analysis"" (citing United States v. Topco Assocs., Inc. 405 U.S. 596, 
610, 92 S. Ct. 1126, 31 L. Ed. 2d 515 (1972)). The O'Bannon II panel had no occasion to address it, as the parties there limited 
their dispute to whether the challenged rules, as a factual matter, preserved consumer demand. See 802 F.3d at 1072-74. So, 
too, here: The parties have agreed that the relevant market is the market for Student-Athletes' labor, while the market to be "
1707,," assessed for pro-competitive effects is the market for college sports. Thus, the issue is not presented in this case. Because the 
issue raised by amici is ""not properly before us,"" we express no view on its merits, and leave it for another day. Pres. Coal., Inc. 
v. Pierce, 667 F.2d 851, 862 (9th Cir. 1982)."
1707,15," These benefits were: an academic incentive payment with a maximum value of $10,000, a graduation incentive payment with 
a maximum value of $10,000, a post-eligibility undergraduate scholarship, a work-study payment, off-season expenses, a 
graduate school scholarship for the COA, and a post-eligibility study-abroad scholarship. "
1708,16," The NCAA asserts that the district court proceeded from the ""simply fictional"" premise that the dividing line between student-
athletes and professionals is that the latter may receive ""unlimited pay."" In context, the district court was using the term 
""unlimited pay"" as shorthand for payments that run the risk of eroding consumer perception of student-athletes as students—that 
is, cash payments unrelated to education and akin to professional salaries. The NCAA's own expert used that shorthand in 
surveying consumer attitudes toward an ""unlimited payments scenario,"" where ""a college could pay a student-athlete any 
amount it wanted to, without any limit, for playing college sports."" "
1709,17," Those benefits are the following: ""computers, science equipment, musical instruments and other tangible items not included in 
the cost of attendance calculation but nonetheless related to the pursuit of academic studies; post-eligibility scholarships to 
complete undergraduate or graduate degrees at any school; scholarships to attend vocational school; tutoring; expenses related 
to studying abroad that are not included in the cost of attendance calculation; and paid post-eligibility internships."" In re NCAA 
Athletic Grant-In-Aid Cap Antitrust Litig., 2019 WL 1593939, at *1. "
1710,18," The $5,600 cap on academic achievement awards and the $5,000 cap on deferred NIL compensation that the panel majority 
struck down in O'Bannon II may be ""remarkably close"" as a numerical matter, but they are different where it counts: Unlike 
deferred NIL compensation, academic achievement awards are plainly education-related and, thus, reinforce the demand-
preserving perception of student-athletes as students. "
1713,19," Student-Athletes further contend that the FPP Act and similar proposed legislation in other states indicate a ""consensus"" that 
student-athletes' receipt of payments unrelated to education will not dampen consumer interest in college sports. However, the 
Act's legislative history suggests that concerns about fundamental fairness, rather than considerations regarding demand, drove 
its enactment. See, e.g., S.B. 206 Assembly Floor Analysis 2 (Sept. 4, 2019), available at https://tinyurl.com/SB-206-AFA . "
1719,1," I assume the facts alleged in the amended complaint to be true for purposes of resolving this motion. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556

1723,3," In this round of briefing, 3Shape does not contend that Align's other actions—its design of the iTero Element Scanner, its 
termination of the interoperability agreement with 3Shape in 2017, and its patent litigation—are independently anticompetitive. 
(D.I. 71 at 13-16; see also Tr. 22:4-7.) Rather, 3Shape argues that Align's other conduct has contributed to the overall 
exclusionary effect and evidences its intent to monopolize. (Id.) "
1724,4," The only case cited by Align that dismissed an exclusive dealing claim at the pleading stage for failure to allege substantial 
foreclosure is International Construction Products LLC v. Caterpillar Inc., C.A. No. 15-108, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6826, 2016 
WL 264909, at *4 (D. Del. Jan. 21, 2016). In that case, the court noted that ""the factual allegations [in the complaint] pertaining to 
exclusive dealing [were] sparse"" and that it ""allege[d] no facts about the nature of the exclusive dealing arrangements and their 
potentially anticompetitive effects."" 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6826, [WL] at *5-6. That case does not stand for the proposition that a 
specific percentage of foreclosure must be alleged. Here, 3Shape has alleged numerous facts about the nature of Align's arrangements with DSOs and has alleged facts regarding 
their exclusionary effects."
1724,5," The LePage's standard for bundled discounts has not been adopted by any other Circuit Court of Appeals, and it has not been 
expanded in the Third Circuit. See Cascade Health Solutions v. PeaceHealth, 515 F.3d 883, 894-903, 908-09 (9th Cir. 2008) 
(discussing the controversy over LePage's). The Third Circuit has instructed courts to interpret LePage's narrowly in light of 
more recent Supreme Court precedent. See ZF Meritor, 696 F.3d at 274 n.11 (acknowledging the Supreme Court's recent 
emphasis on adherence to the predatory pricing test to assess the legality of price discounts). "
1725,6," Because I conclude that the amended complaint plausibly alleges anticompetitive conduct in connection with Align's DSO 
arrangements and its Fusion Program (which will result in the case moving forward), I do not address Align's argument that its 
Advantage Program does not constitute anticompetitive conduct. Align is free to re-raise at the summary judgment stage its 
arguments that the Advantage Program is not actionable anticompetitive conduct, either alone or in connection with its other 
conduct. "
1727,7," Align also argues, in a footnote, that 3Shape lacks antitrust standing to assert its claim that Align monopolized the aligner 
market. (D.I. 67 at 19 n.12.) To establish antitrust standing, a plaintiff must show that it has suffered an ""antitrust injury""—that is, 
an ""'injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flows from that which makes [the] defendants' acts 
unlawful.'"" Ethypharm S.A. France v. Abbott Labs., 707 F.3d 223, 233 (3d Cir. 2013) (alteration in original) (quoting Brunswick 
Corp., 429 U.S. at 489). Typically, only consumers and competitors in the restrained market have antitrust standing. See W. 
Penn, 627 F.3d at 102. A plaintiff may also have antitrust standing when its ""injuries are the means by which the defendant[] 
seek[s] to achieve [its] anticompetitive ends."" Hanover 3201 Realty, LLC v. Vill. Supermarkets, Inc., 806 F.3d 162, 172 (quoting 
W. Penn, 627 F.3d at 102). Antitrust standing is a prudential limitation rather than a jurisdictional requirement. Ethypharm, 707 F.3d at 232. As such, 
antitrust standing ""is more properly viewed as an element of an antitrust claim"" that can be resolved at a later stage of the case. 
In re Wellbutrin XL Antitrust Litig., 868 F.3d 132, 164 (3d Cir. 2017). Align does not challenge 3Shape's standing with respect to the scanner market, but it points out that 3Shape is neither a 
competitor nor a consumer in the aligner market. Having reviewed the complaint in its entirety, I find that 3Shape has plausibly 
alleged that the injuries it suffered to its scanner business as a result of Align's conduct were the means by which Align sought to 
maintain its monopoly in the aligner market. I conclude, therefore, that 3Shape has adequately pleaded antitrust standing at this 
stage. Align is free to re-raise its antitrust standing arguments at the summary judgment stage. "
1730,1," Plaintiffs' complaint includes a significant number of paragraphs discussing incidents of patient care, alleged violations of 
Medicare and Nevada licensing statutes, and multiple other allegations that are not relevant to either antitrust or unjust 
enrichment claims. Due to this lack of relevance, the Court declines to include those allegations in its recitation of the facts. "
1731,2," Even if the Court were to consider the parties alleged in the proposed amended complaint, the analysis would not change. 
(ECF No. 108 Ex. 1 at ¶¶ 1-15.)"
1731,3," Because the Court dismisses Plaintiffs' complaint in its entirety for failure to state a claim, Defendant NNRH's motion to strike 
(ECF No. 45) and Defendant Highland Manor's Rule 12(b)(4-5) arguments are moot. Thus, the Court denies them without 
prejudice. "
1732,4," These vague assertions evince another deficiency that pervades the complaint in that it does not allege facts sufficient to show 
how this claim applies to every Defendant. Plaintiffs attempt to assert all of the causes of action against all Defendants, but, for 
example, there is no allegation mentioning Defendant Iguban anywhere in the complaint except in the caption and in Paragraph 
20, which only states that he resides and does business in Elko, Nevada. "
1734,5," In the event Plaintiffs choose to file an amended complaint, the Court refers counsel to LR IA 10-1, LR 7-2, and LR 7-3 for use 
in their litigation before this Court. Furthermore, the Court notes that the practice of simply copying and pasting paragraphs from 
a complaint into a responsive filing does not actually constitute argument or rebuttal of the relevant motion. See, e.g., Aubrecht 
v. Penn. State Police, 389 Fed. App'x 189, 192-93 (3d Cir. 2010). Indeed, such a ""copy-and-paste approach to briefing . . . 'is 
inexcusable for a counseled complaint.'"" Dama v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., No. 18-CV-03104, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 215738, 
2018 WL 6706314, at *2 n.3 (E.D.N.Y. Dec. 20, 2018) (quoting Lowe v. Planning & Zoning Comm'n of Town of Mansfield, No. 
3:16-CV-381, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4842, 2018 WL 379010, at *4 n.3 (D. Conn. Jan. 10, 2018)). "
1738,1," Plaintiffs do not explicitly state whether, or through what contractual, legal or procedural mechanism, competing operators 
would be obligated to assume royalty payments of 30% to Land Corp if another operator was permitted to develop the unit and 
pooled Anadarko's interest. However, at the stage of a motion to dismiss, the Court is obligated to indulge all reasonable 
inferences in Plaintiffs' favor. See, e.g., Swanson v. Bixler, 750 F.2d 810, 813 (10th Cir. 1984). Here, Plaintiffs allege that due to 
the leases executed between Onshore and Land Corp, competing operators could not operate profitably even if those 
competitiors leased Plaintiffs' rights and applied for permits on the expiration of Defendants' permits. ((See, e.g., Doc. 25 at 3) 
(""[T]he non-competitive royalty rate essentially guaranteed that competitors would be unable to economically lease the plaintiffs, 
pool the defendants, and profitably drill wells."")). This allegation is sufficient for the Court to draw the reasonable inference that a 
competing operator, if permitted, would be obligated by contract or law to fulfill the 30% royalty owed to Land Corp. In drawing 
this inference, the Court does not mean to indicate this is the only plausible reading of Plaintiffs' Complaint. "
1742,2," The State of Wyoming Legislature recently enacted an amendment to § 30-5-109, which becomes effective on July 1, 2020. 
See Drilling Units-Risk Penalties and Mandatory Royalties Act, H.B. 14, Budget Sess. 2020 (Wyo. 2020). Under the amendment, 
in addition to other modifications to the statute, pooling orders shall ""expire twelve (12) months after issuance if the person 
authorized to drill and operate a well fails to commence operations within twelve (12) months of issuance of the pooling order."" 
Id. Further, the amendment includes a provision for the payment of royalty to an unleased, non-consenting owner in a drilling 
unit during the operator's cost-recovery period. The new royalty payment provision mandates the royalty payment be in the 
amount of sixteen percent (16%) or ""[t]he acreage weighted average royalty interest of the leased tracts within the drilling unit."" 
Id. "
1746,3," Although Defendants do not appear to challenge Plaintiffs' proposed product market, Defendants draw the Court's attention to 
Buccaneer Energy (USA) Inc. v. Gunnison Energy Corp., 846 F.3d 1297, 1314 (10th Cir. 2017). In Buccaneer Energy, the Tenth 
Circuit considered whether a plaintiff's mere designation of ""production rights"" as the relevant product was a deficient description 
of the product market. In finding that the Plaintiff had failed to meet its burden on summary judgment, the Court stated: By arguing only that the district court's definition is wrong, but never offering a definition it considers to be right, Buccaneer 
left that question open and, as a result, impermissibly shirked its ""obligat[ion] to make an affirmative showing of [its] 
proposed relevant market."" Id. at 1314 (quoting Telecor Commc'ns, Inc. v. Southwestern Bell Tel. Co., 305 F.3d 1124, 1134 (10th Cir. 2002), 305 F.3d 1124, 
1131 (10th Cir. 2002)). The Court acknowledges the value of Buccaneer in its holding that ""production rights"" is a legally 
deficient description of a relevant product. However, the question presently before the Court relates to the relevant geographic 
market, not the relevant product market. Further, at this stage of these proceedings, Plaintiffs' burden is only to allege a plausible 
relevant geographic market, not to make an affirmative showing."
1746,4," On this point, Campfield does not warrant a contrary conclusion. In Campfield, the Tenth Circuit held that a plaintiff's alleged 
market of ""the State Farm insured repairable windshield repair market, in the geographic area of the United States of America"" 
was deficient. Campfield, 532 F.3d at 1119 (citing Jayco Sys., Inc. v. Savin Bus. Mach. Corp., 777 F.2d 306, 319 n. 43 (5th Cir. 
1985) (""[O]ne purchaser in a market of competing purchasers cannot constitute a relevant geographic market, absent 
exceptional market conditions"")). This case is readily distinguishable from the facts of Campfield. The Campfield plaintiff owned 
an automobile glass repair shop and brought antitrust allegations against an auto-insurance agency that refused to endorse the 
plaintiff's patented windshield repair technique, which refusal limited the plaintiff's access to the defendant's market of insured 
customers. Unlike the Campfield plaintiff, Plaintiffs in this case have not limited their alleged market to Anadarko as its sole 
lessee, but rather allege that they are not able to market their mineral interests to any operator given the anticompetitive effects 
of Anadarko's lease complexes. "
1747,5," See Allen v. Dairy Farmers of Am., Inc., 748 F. Supp. 2d 323, 338-39 (D. Vt. 2010) (collecting cases) (""dismissals at the pre-
discovery, pleading stage . . . are generally limited to instances in which the complaint either: (1) fails to allege a geographic 
market or the boundaries of a relevant geographic market, see, e.g., Sun Microsystems, Inc. v. Versata Enters., Inc., 630 F. 
Supp. 2d 395, 403 (D. Del. 2009); (2) defines a geographic market in an unreasonably and implausibly narrow manner, see,

Dist. LEXIS 89071, 2008 WL 4821320, *3 (""An antitrust plaintiff fails to state a claim only where a proposed market definition is 
patently implausible on the basis of the four corners of the complaint.""). "
1759,1," The Court granted ILWU's motion for new trial ""relating to damages."" The Court, however, has not yet described the 
parameters of that trial. Both parties cite Great Coastal Exp., Inc. v. Int'l Bhd. of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen & 
Helpers of Am., 511 F.2d 839, 844-48 (4th Cir. 1975). Although the second trial in that case was limited to damages, the trial 
court there also allowed evidence and argument related to causation. Precisely how a second trial limited to damages will be 
structured here is an issue that the Court reserves for another day."
1759,2," This district court previously found persuasive the Seventh Circuit's discussion in Ahrenholz v. Bd. of Trs., 219 F.3d 674, 677 
(7th Cir. 2000), holding that HN7[
] under § 1292(b), a question of law is generally one that is ""pure"" or ""abstract"" and does not require a review of the record. See, e.g., Columbia Sportswear N. Am., Inc. v. Seirus Innovative Accessories, Inc., 2020 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 12050, 2020 WL 403722, at *3 (D. Or. Jan. 24, 2020); accord Schedler v. FieldTurf USA, Inc., 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
7433, 2018 WL 451555 (D. Or. Jan. 17, 2018) (explaining that the issue was not a controlling question of law in part because it

Or. Oct. 16, 2017) (citing Ahrenholz and concluding the issue was not a ""pure question of law"" and thus not controlling). The 
Seventh Circuit later held, however, that HN8[
] when the court of appeals is not asked to overturn any findings of fact, but 
instead ""to determine the legal significance of a set of facts"" by deciding whether a complaint met the pleading standard set forth 
in Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007), such a determination might be 
appropriate for interlocutory appeal. In re Text Messaging Antitrust Litig., 630 F.3d 622, 625-26 (7th Cir. 2010). The court 
certified the case for interlocutory appeal despite the fact that such a review is often labeled as a ""mixed question of law and 
fact,"" noting that such labels were ""not helpful,"" and concluding that an appeal under § 1292(b) ""should not be precluded 
altogether by a narrow interpretation of 'question of law.'"" Id. The court distinguished Ahrenholz because resolving the Twombly 
issue did not require ""hunting through a record or immersing ourselves in a complicated contract."" Id. at 626. The court further 
noted that HN9[
] ""application of a legal standard is a controlling question of law,"" although ""routine applications of well-settled 
legal standards to facts"" are not. Id."
1759,3," In Steering Committee v. United States, 6 F.3d 572 (9th Cir. 1993), the Ninth Circuit sua sponte addressed whether it could 
consider an interlocutory appeal of a mixed issue of law and fact ""served the congressional purposes underlying § 1292(b)."" Id. 
(quoting In re Air Crash Disaster at John F. Kennedy Int'l Airport on June 24, 1975, 479 F. Supp. 1118, 1126 (E.D.N.Y. 1978)). 
The Ninth Circuit, however, has certified some cases under § 1292(b) that are not multidistrict litigation actions yet involve mixed 
questions of law and fact. See, e.g., Tahoe-Sierra Pres. Council, Inc. v. Tahoe Reg'l Planning Agency, 216 F.3d 764 (9th Cir. "

1761,4," To the extent ILWU requests certification of the Court's citations to Mead in the Post-Trial Opinion for the two discrete issues 
for which it was cited, the Court declines certification. The Court cited Mead as one authority among others supporting ""routine

1769,3," Although aptly summarizing the facts in, and ably applying the law of, Aspen, the report perhaps awkwardly analogizes 
Syniverse's free peering to free skiing on a competitor's mountain. However, no awkwardness in any of the report's analogies 
undermines the balance of the report's well-reasoned and thorough analysis."
1769,4," Syniverse's charging tyntec for ICV services suggests an aim to increase short-term profit. That is, tyntec cannot reasonably 
argue that the only possible reason for Syniverse's terminating the free peering arrangement was to exclude tyntec from the 
market. If tyntec accepted Syniverse's offer, the result would guarantee immediate short-term profit for Syniverse. Thus, 
although Syniverse's rejection of free peering ""may suggest a hard-nosed intent to undo rivals"" (which is unactionable conduct 
by itself), the rejection suggests no ""inten[t] to forgo profits."" Novell, 731 F.3d at 1078. Even if cast as ""raising rivals' costs,"" as 
attempted by tyntec, that description fails to ""displace Aspen and Trinko's profit-sacrifice test in the narrow world of refusal to 
deal cases."" Novell, 731 F.3d at 1079. tyntec clearly cannot satisfy Trinko's profit-sacrifice test. The record lopsidedly 
establishes that Syniverse retained a profit-seeking incentive throughout the entirety of Syniverse's negotiations with tyntec. The 
desire to defeat competition, if coupled with legitimate business or efficiency explanations, defeats antitrust liability."
1769,5," Although tyntec disputes similarity to these entities, tyntec itself analogizes the business services of these entities to tyntec's 
own business services."
1769,6," Of course, tyntec argues that many more customers will become dissatisfied because Syniverse will eventually charge 
monopolistic prices — after Syniverse routs tyntec out of the market. Determining the accuracy of broad, speculative, and 
attenuated assumptions such as this, even if correct, falls outside the judiciary's expertise. Further, the Aspen defendant and 
plaintiff were the only two participants in the construed ""market,"" but more options exist for ICV customers. Thus, tyntec's 
argument falters in any event."

relying in part on evidence provided by Craft (Document No. 706, filed May 15, 2020). The Court concludes that this precedent is 
unpersuasive because the Second Circuit applies a less rigorous standard for analyzing ascertainability. "
1837,5," The Court notes that EPPs' interpretation of the ascertainability requirement is not supported by Third Circuit precedent. See, 
e.g., Marcus v. BMW of N. Am., LLC, 687 F.3d 583, 593 (3d Cir. 2012) (""[The ascertainability requirement] protects absent class 
members by facilitating the 'best notice practicable' under Rule 23(c)(2) in a Rule 23(b)(3) action.""); Carrera v. Bayer Corp., 727 
F.3d 300, 307 (3d Cir. 2013) (""First, at the commencement of a class action, ascertainability and a clear class definition allow 
potential class members to identify themselves for purposes of opting out of a class."")."
1837,6," Judge, former Chief Judge, U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. In re Pharmaceutical Industry Average 
Wholesale Price Litigation, No. 01-12257, (D. Mass. filed Dec. 19, 2001). "
1838,7," HN22[
] Under federal antitrust law, antitrust injury occurs the moment that a purchaser incurs an overcharge. See Adams v. Mills, 286 U.S. 397, 407, 52 S. Ct. 589, 76 L. Ed. 1184 (1932). Antitrust injury is also referred to as ""antitrust impact."" See In re 
Hydrogen Peroxide Antitrust Litig., 552 F.3d at 311. "
1841,8," EPPs argue that they are entitled to a presumption of causation that the class sustained classwide injury. EPPs' Class Cert. 
Mem. 24-25. They claim that ""an antitrust plaintiff may be entitled to a presumption of causation where the anticompetitive 
conduct 'is deemed wrongful because it is believed significantly to increase the risk of a particular injury' and that injury 
occurred."" Id. at 24 (citing In re Actos End-Payor Antitrust Litig., 848 F.3d 89, 101 (2d Cir. 2017)). The Court agrees with 
defendants that Actos does not diminish EPPs' burden of proving classwide antitrust injury. See Defs.' Opp'n Class Cert. 56. "
1845,9," EPPs provided notice to the Court that Judge Goldberg recently certified a settlement class in Vista Healthplan, Inc. v. 
Cephalon, Inc., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 69614, No. 2:06-cv-01833, slip op. at 1 (E.D. Pa. Apr. 21, 2020). However, Judge 
Goldberg made clear that the prospect of settlement impacted his analysis of both ascertainability and predominance. Id. at 24-
25, 28. Indeed, many of the concerns at issue in certifying a litigation class are alleviated after settlement. See In re Wellbutrin 
XL Antitrust Litig., 308 F.R.D. at 151 n.8 (""In certifying a litigation class, the Court must be mindful of a defendant's due process 
rights. Such a concern is not present when administering a settlement class.""). "
1848,10," EPPs' contention that ""[d]efendants have not rebutted Plaintiffs' common evidence of injury with any substantiated example of 
a specific uninjured class member in the record,"" EPPs' Reply Class Cert. 34, is unpersuasive in light of the expert testimony 
discussed above and the extremely limited data production in the case. "
1849,11," EPPs have failed to provide to the Court with an adequate analysis of which state antitrust laws permit a pass-on defense to 
damages. EPPs summarily contend that the pass-on defense is not permitted under state law because ""the relevant antitrust 
statutes have language mirroring federal antitrust laws, contain a federal harmonization provision, and/or have been interpreted 
in harmony with federal law."" EPPs' Class Cert. Mot. 20 (citing App. A). However, as defendants persuasively argue, ""[i]n 
permitting indirect purchaser actions at all, the [Illinois Brick repealer] state has already determined that its laws will not follow, 
but rather will deviate significantly, from federal antitrust law."" Defs.' Opp'n Class Cert. 70; May 15, 2019 Hr'g Tr. 20:6-19. 
These statutory deviations specifically repeal Illinois Brick's bar against indirect purchaser actions, the symmetrical counterpart 
to Hanover Shoe which eliminated the pass-on defense under federal law. See In re Lower Lake Erie Iron Ore Antitrust Litig., 
998 F.2d 1144, 1164 n.10 (3d Cir. 1993). As such, EPPs' references to generic federal antitrust harmonization provisions does 
not provide the Court with the individualized analysis of the applicable states' laws to determine whether each state would permit 
a pass-on defense, and ""the Court will decline to undertake the 'back-breaking labor involved in deciphering the state of antitrust 
[pass-on defense] in each of those states.'"" See In re Processed Egg Prod. Antitrust Litig., 312 F.R.D. 124, 148-149 (E.D. Pa. 
2015). "
1850,12," Defendants also claim that EPPs failed to properly conduct a choice of law analysis. Defs.' Opp'n Class Cert. 77-81. The Court 
is not persuaded by this argument and agrees with EPPs that ""[u]nder proper choice of law principles, the law of the state where 
the drug was purchased from a pharmacy governs because the injury (i. e., overcharge) occurs at the point of sale."" EPPs' 
Reply Class Cert. 54. See In re Flonase Antitrust Litig., 815 F. Supp. 2d 867, 883-84 (E.D. Pa. 2011); In re Wellbutrin XL 
Antitrust Litig., 282 F.R.D. 126, 134-136 (E.D. Pa. 2011); Sheet Metal Workers Local 441 Health & Welfare Plan v. 
GlaxoSmithKline, PLC, 737 F. Supp. 2d 380, 391 (E.D. Pa. 2010)."
1850,13," The inquiry into whether variations in state laws can be manageably addressed implicates both the predominance and 
superiority requirements. See Vista Healthplan, Inc., No. 06-1833, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 74846, 2015 WL 3623005, at *35. The 
Court considers this issue under the predominance standard. See, e.g., In re Thalomid & Revlimid Antitrust Litig., No. 14-6997, 
2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 186457, 2018 WL 6573118, at *11. "
1855,1," On May 15, 2020, Plaintiff also filed a request for oral argument. (Dkt. No. 57.) Plaintiff did not explain why oral argument was 
needed. Having reviewed Plaintiff's request, the parties' filings, and the relevant legal authorities, the Court deems the matter 
suitable for disposition without a hearing pursuant to Civil Local Rule 7-1(b). "
1858,2," Plaintiff also argues that a determination of whether there is a unity of interest is premature at the pleading stage. (See Pl.'s 
Opp'n at 2 n.1.) As discussed below, however, based on Plaintiff's own allegations, there appears to be a unity of interest. "
1863,3," In its supplemental brief, Plaintiff argues that Chavez was limited to cases involving safe harbors. (Pl.'s Supp. Br. at 3.) As 
discussed above, however, numerous courts have applied Chavez, focusing on whether the plaintiff is relying on the same 
factual allegations for both the statutory violation and a UCL claim based on the ""unfair"" prong. The above cases did not involve 
conduct which was condoned under antitrust laws."
1863,4," In the alternative, Defendants argue that Plaintiff's UCL claim must be dismissed because it falls within the safe harbor of the 
DMV traffic school statutes, namely California Vehicle Code § 11200 et seq. Section 11202(a)(7)(B) provides: ""A person may be 
an operator for more than one traffic school if (i) the schools have a common owner or owners and (ii) the schools share a single 
established business address."" Defendants thus contend that its ownership of multiple traffic schools is expressly permitted by 
statute, and cannot support a UCL claim. (Defs.' Mot. to Dismiss at 15.) The Court need not reach this issue because the Court 
finds that the UCL claim fails for separate reasons. The Court observes, however, that the Supreme Court in Cel-Tech found that 
""[i]f the Legislature has permitted certain conduct or considered a situation and concluded no action should lie, courts may not 
override that determination."" 20 Cal. 4th at 182. "

evidently misreads the phrase ""courts of general jurisdiction"" to mean ""general personal jurisdiction,"" which is a type of personal 
jurisdiction rather than a type of court. Nonetheless, the Court concludes — and therefore does not survey the laws of all fifty

1924,11," The complaint also contains allegations that AbbVie made material misrepresentations and omissions to the USPTO during 
the prosecution of its patents. [109] ¶ 114. But the complaint does not assert a Walker Process claim, [144] at 27 n.4, likely 
because these plaintiffs would lack standing to do so. Farag v. Health Care Serv. Corp., 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 103302, 2017 
WL 2868999, at *6 (N.D. Ill. July 5, 2017). In the end, even if plaintiffs could pursue a misrepresentation theory (while disclaiming 
reliance on Walker Process), plaintiffs effectively concede that not all of AbbVie's patents are invalid and they do not intend to 
prove that AbbVie's conduct was objectively baseless. That is enough to establish Noerr-Pennington protection for AbbVie's 
conduct before the USPTO."
1924,12," Plaintiffs identify another argument that could not have been advanced during inter partes review and that diminishes any 
suggestion that AbbVie's patent portfolio is legitimate: because AbbVie had to describe in its original patent application the best 
mode contemplated for carrying out the invention (i.e., adalimumab), 35 U.S.C. § 112(a), the formulation and manufacturing 
patents that post-date the original adalimumab patent cannot possibly have prevented biosimilar competitors from coming to 
market. [144] at 39-40. As a result, plaintiffs say AbbVie should be estopped from asserting that those patents ever could have 
prevented biosimilar competitors from coming to market. Id. at 40. But even if AbbVie could not point to some of its patents as 
barriers to biosimilar entry, plaintiffs' theory remains that the entire thicket and conduct surrounding the thicket restrained 
competition. Picking at some of the patents as legally irrelevant to biosimilar manufacturing because of the original patent's best-
mode disclosure is just another way to say that AbbVie made unreasonable representations during the patent dance. But that 
the thicket and surrounding conduct were not as formidable as they may have seemed is a minor point given plaintiffs' 
overarching claim, and raises the question of how plausible it is to glean concrete harm to consumers from the biosimilar 
manufacturers' analysis of risk when taking on AbbVie's patents."
1924,13," To the extent AbbVie's petitioning before the USPTO and PTAB was unsuccessful, that petitioning did not give rise to an 
antitrust injury. See § III.C. AbbVie's patent applications required no response from any of the biosimilar manufacturers and were 
not so numerous that it is plausible to allege that their sheer volume intimidated AbbVie's sophisticated competitors into forgoing "
1925,," the production of biosimilars (especially not to the degree those petitions were objectively baseless), and plaintiffs have not 
alleged that any of AbbVie's submissions during the inter partes reviews were objectively baseless. See [109] ¶ 108."
1925,14," Actually, the exchanges that take place between applicants and reference product sponsors during the patent dance portion of 
the FDA's biosimilar application process might not qualify as petitioning at all, since neither party is (at that moment) asking the 
government to do anything. See Freeman v. Lasky, Haas & Cohler, 410 F.3d 1180, 1184 (9th Cir. 2005) (""discovery is merely 
communication between parties as an aid to litigation,"" and is not a petition because it is not ""in any sense a communication to 
the court,"" although ""conduct incidental to"" a petition is protected if the petition itself is protected). Still, as discussed below, 
plaintiffs fail to allege a § 2 claim because most of the conduct upon which their allegations are based was immunized, and 
because plaintiffs' theory depends on considering AbbVie's conduct as a whole. See [144] at 44-45. See also MCI 
Communications Corp. v. American Tel. & Tel. Co., 708 F.2d 1081, 1155 n.114 (7th Cir. 1983)."
1925,15," HN18[
] Even if patentees are presumed to enforce their patents in good faith, see C.R. Bard, Inc. v. M3 Sys., Inc., 157 F.3d"
1925,1340," , 1369 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (the law ""recognizes a presumption that the assertion of a duly granted patent is made in good 
faith""), that presumption is evidentiary, id., and evidentiary presumptions do not overcome plausible allegations at the pleading 
stage. See also Golan v. Pingel Enter., Inc., 310 F.3d 1360, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (""if the party challenging such statements 
under state or federal law presents clear and convincing evidence that the infringement allegations are objectively false, and that 
the patentee made them in bad faith, viz., with knowledge of their incorrectness or falsity, or disregard for either, the statements 
are actionable and are not protected by the existence of a patent""). "
1930,16," It is not always necessary to determine which of the three categories of analysis should be applied when ruling on a motion to 
dismiss. City of Rockford v. Mallinckrodt ARD, Inc., 360 F.Supp.3d 730, 754 (N.D. Ill. 2019), reconsideration denied, No. 17 C 
50107, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 103885, 2019 WL 2763181 (N.D. Ill. May 3, 2019). See also Areeda & Hovenkamp, § 305(e) 
(""Often ... the decision about which rule is to be employed will await facts that are developed only in discovery."") But there are no 
facts that need to be developed before determining which rule to apply here. The plaintiffs have alleged in their complaint the 
basic terms of the agreements and how they affected the market. See [109] ¶¶ 157-210. "
1931,17," The defendants challenge the plausibility of plaintiffs' allegation that there was a quid pro quo in the U.S. and European 
agreements. Mylan and Boehringer agreed to roughly the same U.S. market entry dates as the other biosimilar manufacturers 
despite not accepting an early European entry date. [109] ¶¶ 177-84, 203. That undermines the inference that those European 
early entry dates were worth all that much or were a bargaining chip in the U.S. settlements. Similarly, AbbVie points out that it 
only has three European patents, that those three patents ""protect indications for adalimumab for only four diseases, leaving at 
least five other diseases for which Humira is approved unguarded by patents in Europe,"" [124] at 36-37, and so the European 
patents were not a valuable barrier to competition. And the complaint itself alleges that AbbVie's European adalimumab patent 
expired on the same day that the agreements allowed Amgen, Samsung Bioepis, and Sandoz to enter the European market, 
further undermining the implication that the European early entry dates were worth all that much (or that they were ""early"" at all). 
[109] ¶ 203. But at this stage, I put aside potential inconsistencies and accept plaintiffs' factual allegation of an exchange. The 
complaint alleges that AbbVie's conduct rendered it difficult (if not impossible) to sell competing biosimilars in Europe absent the 
agreements in question, and concluding otherwise would require drawing an inference in AbbVie's favor. See [109] ¶¶ 185-202. "
1932,18," Plaintiffs also rely on Tawfilis v. Allergan, Inc.. 157 F.Supp.3d 853, 862 (C.D. Cal. 2015). Although it found allegations of 
anticompetitive injury arising from a licensing agreement between competitors to be plausible, that case makes no mention of 
Actavis [**61]  and is neither binding nor persuasive here."
1932,19," Although it is ""normally not necessary to litigate patent validity to answer the antitrust question,"" F.T.C. v. Actavis, Inc., 570 
U.S. 136, 157, 133 S. Ct. 2223, 186 L. Ed. 2d 343 (2013), plaintiffs' theory here does require a detailed exploration of both the 
validity of hundreds of patents (some of which have already been the subject of extensive infringement litigation and other 
disputes before the USPTO and PTAB) and whether those patents were infringed. That makes the European revenue conferred 
on the biosimilar companies a far less helpful proxy for market power because the alleged reverse-payment has to be measured 
against the global litigation risks and the approximate strength of hundreds of AbbVie's patents (plus AbbVie's intellectual 
property portfolio in Europe). In other words, the allegations here require even more expensive and time-consuming litigation "
1933,," than in Actavis, and this further suggests that plaintiffs' theory pushes antitrust doctrine into unintended overlap with the patent 
regime. "
1934,20," Plaintiffs say that under their alternative settlement theory, the biosimilar companies had significant leverage and could have 
obtained licenses for any patents that were valid and infringed (i.e., ""blocking patents""). [144] at 67. But for the reasons 
discussed with regard to the alternative settlement theory below, that claim is possible—not plausible. "
1935,21," Plaintiffs did not allege that any of the biosimilar manufacturers sent notice to AbbVie that they intended to market their 
biosimilar, which suggests those manufacturers may not have launched their biosimilars anyway. See 42 U.S.C. § 262(l)(8)(A) & 
(B); [124] at 47; [150] at 26. But plaintiffs were not required to account in their complaint for all of AbbVie's alternative scenarios, 
and I draw the reasonable inference in plaintiffs' favor that there was no technical barrier to launching at risk. "
1936,22," Subject-matter jurisdiction exists over the state-law claims because the amount in controversy exceeds $5,000,000, see, e.g., 
[109] ¶ 251, and because at least one member of the proposed class of plaintiffs is a citizen of a state different from at least one 
of the defendants. Id. ¶¶ 14-24, 224-225; 28 U.S.C. § 1332(d)(2)."
1936,23," Plaintiffs' statutory labels are not controlling. For instance, plaintiffs cite Alaska Stat. Ann. § 45.50.471, which they describe 
first as a ""state consumer protection law[] that prohibit[s] anticompetitive conduct,"" [109] ¶¶ 276, 292, second, as a ""state 
consumer protection law[] that prohibit[s] monopolization,"" id. ¶ 306, and third, as a state law that prohibits ""unfair and 
unconscionable conduct."" Id. ¶¶ 309-10, 317. HN49[
] The statute does not contain the words anticompetitive, monopoly, or 
unconscionable, and pertains to deceptive acts and practices more akin to trademark infringement than antitrust violations. See, 
e.g., Alaska Stat. Ann. § 45.50.471(b)(1). Alaska's antitrust laws are codified elsewhere. See, e.g., Alaska Stat. Ann. § 
45.50.562. HN50[
] That being said, plaintiffs do not have to cite the right laws in their complaint. N.A.A.C.P. v. Am. Family Mut. Ins. Co., 978 F.2d 287, 292 (7th Cir. 1992) (a complaint ""should limn the grievance and demand relief"" and ""need not 
identify the law on which the claim rests""); Beaton v. SpeedyPC Software, 907 F.3d 1018, 1023 (7th Cir. 2018), cert. denied, 139 
S. Ct. 1465, 203 L. Ed. 2d 684 (2019) (""plaintiffs do not need to plead legal theories""). What matters is whether they have stated 
a claim upon which relief can be granted and provided defendants with ""fair notice of what the ... claim is and the grounds upon 
which it rests."" Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007); Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a). "
