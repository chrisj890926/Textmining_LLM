27,1," District Judge David D. Trager passed away in January 2011, at which point this case was reassigned to District Judge Brian 
M. Cogan."
27,2," Because we vacate the judgment and reverse the district court's denial of Defendants' motion to dismiss, we do not address 
the subsequent stages of this litigation nor the related arguments on appeal."
27,3," We set forth here only those facts necessary to resolve the issues on appeal. Unless otherwise noted, the facts have been 
taken from the allegations in [**5]  Plaintiffs' Second Amended Complaint, E.D.N.Y. Dkt. No. 1:06-md-1738, Doc. 179, which we 
accept as true for purposes of resolving a motion to dismiss. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 
868 (2009); Fait v. Regions Fin. Corp., 655 F.3d 105, 109 (2d Cir. 2011). For a more complete recitation of the facts, see the 
district court's November 6, 2008 Memorandum and Order. See In re Vitamin C Antitrust Litig., 584 F. Supp. 2d 546 (E.D.N.Y. 
2008). "
28,4," The parties explicitly disagree over the nature and authority of this entity. Plaintiffs characterize this entity as an ""association"" 
much like a trade association in the United States, while Defendants describe this entity as a government-controlled ""Chamber"" 
of producers, unique to China's state-controlled regulatory regime."
28,5," As Judge Trager noted, the Ministry's appearance in this case is historic because it is the first time any entity of the Chinese 
Government has appeared amicus curiae before any U.S. court. On appeal, the Ministry also appears amicus curiae before this 
Court."
28,6," In an annex to its brief to the district court, the Ministry provided the Mitnick Declaration, which contained a copy of all 
regulations cited by the Ministry. The Ministry noted that all documents were properly authenticated consistent with Rule 902(3) 
of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which governs the self-authentication of foreign documents. "

] ""Under § 402 of the Foreign Trade Antitrust Improvements Act of 1982 (""FTAIA""), the Sherman Act does not apply to conduct involving foreign trade or commerce, other than import trade or import commerce, unless 'such conduct has a direct, 
substantial, and reasonably foreseeable effect' on domestic or import commerce."" Hartford Fire, 509 U.S. at 796 (quoting 15 
U.S.C. § 6a(1)(A)) (internal citations omitted). "
34,8," Although we adopted the Republic of Indonesia's ""reading of the relevant Indonesian law,"" we declined to accept fully 
Indonesia's argument on appeal because it had ""not identified any Indonesian statute or regulation"" in support of its position. 
Karaha Bodas, 313 F.3d at 92. To the extent there is no documentary evidence or reference of law proffered to support a foreign 
sovereign's interpretation of its own laws, deference may be inappropriate. "
35,9," Similarly, while the documentary evidence shows that when China transitioned from the export quota regime to the PVC regime 
the role of the Subcommittee within China's regulatory framework changed from a governmental group whose membership was 
mandatory to a non-governmental [**36]  trade organization whose membership was voluntary, we again defer to the Ministry's 
reasonable interpretation that the PVC regime required industry-wide coordination of prices regardless of whether membership 
in the Subcommittee was required. "
36,10," We note that if the Chinese Government had not appeared in this litigation, the district court's careful and thorough treatment 
of the evidence before it in analyzing what Chinese law required at both the motion to dismiss and summary judgment stages 
would have been entirely appropriate."
36,11," To use a domestic example, it would be equally inappropriate for a U.S. court, when analyzing U.S. insurance law, to inquire 
into the lobbying efforts of U.S. insurance companies for the purposes of determining whether U.S. insurance law applied to 
those companies. "
37,12," To use another domestic example, it would be inappropriate for a U.S. court, when analyzing whether U.S. labor laws required 
factory workers to wear safety masks, to examine evidence of how often factory owners [**41]  were punished for such violations 
or how many factory owners actually complied with the safety mask regulations. "
38,13," We take judicial notice of the diplomatic communication from the Embassy of the People's Republic of China to the United 
States State Department dated April 9, 2014. Sprague & Rhodes Commodity Corp. v. Instituto Mexicano Del Cafe, 566 F.2d 
861, 862 (2d Cir. 1977). The Ministry's motion as to the diplomatic communication is denied as moot."
38,14," We note that it may not be reasonable in all cases to abstain on comity grounds from asserting jurisdiction at the motion to 
dismiss stage and that a trial court may need the opportunity to consider the countervailing interests and policies on the record 
that follows discovery. In this case, however, dismissal is appropriate because, after limited discovery, the record before the 
court at the motion to dismiss stage was sufficient to determine what Chinese law required and whether abstention was 
appropriate. "
44,1," By order dated December 15, 2015, the Court preliminarily approved settlement agreements between Plaintiffs and Defendants 
Bank of America Corporation; Bank of America, N.A.; Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc.; [*15]  Barclays Bank PLC; 
Barclays Capital Inc.; BNP Paribas Group; BNP Paribas North America Inc.; BNP Paribas Securities Corp.; BNP Prime 
Brokerage, Inc.; Citigroup Inc.; Citibank, N.A.; Citicorp; Citigroup Global Markets Inc.; The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.;

HSBC Securities (USA) Inc.; JPMorgan Chase & Co.; JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.; The Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC; 
The Royal Bank of Scotland PLC; RBS Securities, Inc.; UBS AG; UBS Group AG and UBS Securities LLC (collectively, the 
""Settling Defendants""). "
45,2," BTMU, RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Société Générale, and Standard Chartered (collectively, the ""New Defendants""). Each of 
the New Defendants is also a Non-Settling Defendant. "
46,3," According to the TAC, ""spot transactions . . . involve the outright [*22]  exchange of currencies between two counterparties on 
a value date that is within two bank business days' time."" "
47,4," According to the TAC, four Defendants (Barclays, Citi, JPMorgan and RBS) have pleaded guilty to conspiring to violate the 
antitrust laws. A fifth, UBS, pleaded guilty to a count of wire fraud for its involvement in manipulating LIBOR and other 
benchmark rates. Included in that plea's statement of facts are admissions that UBS had engaged in deceptive FX trading and 
sales practices after it signed a LIBOR Non-Prosecution Agreement from December 2012. Each of these Defendants is a 
Settling Defendant. "
54,5," This holding also dispenses with the NSDs' separate argument that it would [*50]  be ""virtually impossible to apportion 
damages between Exchange Plaintiffs and OTC Plaintiffs."" "
55,6," The opinion assumes that a Plaintiff who is ""domiciled"" in the United States may conduct transactions both in the United States 
and abroad. "
70,1, This case was initially filed in the District of Massachusetts and was transferred to this district on Defendants' motion. 
71,2," According to Defendants, Rowe merged with Merit Industries, Inc. in 2009; AMI is the successor to Rowe (Defs' Br., Dkt 119 at 
PageID.882 n.1, 909). Defendants refer [*3]  to AMI and Rowe, collectively, as AMI, as will the Court herein."
71,3," ""A 'clickwrap' agreement is typically used in connection with the installation or operation of software on a machine"" (Defs' Br., 
Dkt 119 at PageID.884 n.6). "
80,1," If a CTA chooses the consolidated billing option, PG&E must calculate the CTA's charges based on the customer's natural gas 
usage and apply the proprietary and confidential rate provided by the CTA to PG&E each month. Id. PG&E assumes 
responsibility for the accuracy of the calculation, but not for the rate the CTA provides to it. Id. "
81,2," Plaintiff explicitly identifies four different schemes, but the Court considers the ""payment withholding scheme"" to be 
conceptually distinct from PG&E's alleged pattern and/or practice of falsely identifying Plaintiff's customers as delinquent on their 
bills, as further explained below. "
87,3," Even if federal courts could refer federal claims to a state agency [*27]  without statutory delegation in some instances, there is 
no evidence that CPUC has superior, or even any, technical expertise regarding the federal claims at issue in this case. As 
another court in this district noted in a case alleging identical RICO Act and Sherman Act claims, ""PG&E has not identified any 
issue that requires [CPUC's] technical expertise to resolve, much less any question of first impression."" Id. In fact, as Plaintiff 
notes, in the agency proceeding between the parties in the United Energy case, CPUC acknowledged its lack of experience in 
adjudicating these types of claims. See Dkt. No. 34, Ex. 4 (""[B]ecause [the plaintiff] has now introduced allegations of tortious 
and criminal conduct into this dispute, it has spilled over the jurisdictional limits of [CPUC] . . . [and] raise[s] potential substantive 
and procedural issues under federal law with which administrative law judges have little or no experience and may result in calls 
for procedures or remedies that [CPUC] cannot provide.""). And the fact that CPUC ""is aware of but has expressed no interest in 
the subject matter"" of these types of claims is yet another reason to decline referral to CPUC. See Astiana, 783 F.3d at 760. "
88,4," Within CPUC's lexicon, Gas Rule 23 is a ""tariff rule"": ""Tariffs and tariff rules are authorized pursuant to [California Public Utilities 
Code] section 489, subdivision (a), which provides: 'The commission shall, by rule or order, require every public utility . . . to file 
with [CPUC] . . . and to print and keep open to public inspection, schedules showing all rates, tolls, rentals, charges, and 
classifications collected or enforced, or to be collected or enforced, together with all rules, contracts, privileges, and facilities 
which in any manner affect or relate to rates, tolls, rentals, classifications, or service[.]'"" Davis v. S. Cal. Edison Co., 236 Cal. 
App. 4th 619, 623 n.6, 186 Cal. Rptr. 3d 587 (2015) (citation omitted). Tariffs and tariff rules that have been published and 
approved by CPUC have ""the force . . . of a statute."" Id. at 622, n.1 (citation omitted). "
89,5," Oddly, Defendants did not cite Hartwell, the most directly on-point California Supreme Court case, in their motion. [*35]  Nor did 
they respond in their reply to Plaintiff's discussion of the case. "
94,6," At oral argument, Plaintiff's counsel confirmed that Plaintiff intends to dismiss the breach of contract claim. Dkt. No. 45 at 4. "
95,7," Defendants only contend that the special damages waiver applies to Plaintiff's state law claims, so the Court does not consider 
whether it applies to Plaintiff's federal law claims."
95,8," In its reply brief, PG&E raises for the first time the argument that Plaintiff failed to adequately allege respondeat superior 
liability. MTD Reply at 12. The Court will not consider arguments raised for the first time on reply where it would prejudice the 
opposing party. See Cedano—Viera v. Ashcroft, 324 F.3d 1062, 1066 n.5 (9th Cir. 2003). Because Plaintiff had no opportunity to 
address the issue, the Court does not consider Defendants' argument on respondeat superior liability. However, in any event, at 
oral argument, Plaintiff's counsel acknowledged that its respondeat superior allegations must be pled with greater specificity. 
Dkt. No. 45 at 4. Accordingly, that cause of action is dismissed with leave to amend. "
111,1," This opinion pertains exclusively to credit cards. Though Amex argued before the District Court that the relevant market should 
include debit cards and other alternative payment types as well as a proposed submarket comprising payment-card services 
provided to travel and entertainment (""T & E"") merchants, Amex has abandoned this argument on appeal."
111,2," Almost all credit-card companies employ umbrella networks. As the reader will soon see, Amex is the exception. "

reducing the price paid by the other side by an equal amount; in other words, the price structure matters, and platforms 
must design it so as to bring both sides on board. Jean-Charles Rochet & Jean Tirole, [**8]  Two-Sided Markets: A Progress Report, 37 RAND J. ECON. 645, 664-65 (2006)."

113,15," See Evans & Schmalensee, More than Money, supra note 11, at 286. Relying on the parties' written submissions and expert 
testimony offered at trial, the District Court explained the basics of credit as follows: Credit cards enable cardholders to make purchases at participating merchants by accessing a line of credit extended to the 
cardholder by the issuer of that card. Cardholders are invoiced for purchases typically once per month and often have a 
grace period during which payment may be made. The delay between a purchase event and the cardholder's deadline for 
paying the bill on which that purchase appears is referred to as the ""float,"" and it enables cardholders to temporarily defer 
payment on their purchases at no additional cost (i.e., without paying interest). Am. Express Co., 88 F. Supp. 3d at 153 (citations [**13]  omitted)."

""tends to reduce the price to all buyers and increase[] it to sellers."" Id. (identifying Amex as an example of a company that 
benefits from marquee buyers insofar as these buyers allow Amex ""to charge a relatively high merchant discount as compared

116,35," Diner's Club floundered during this time, in part because it failed to keep up with newly emerging competition from the bank 
card associations. Today, Diner's Club [**21]  has shrunk to almost nothing in the United States. See Evans & Schmalensee, 
More than Money, supra note 11, at 287."
116,36," The District Court found that ""[b]y retaining end-to-end control of all spending data on its network, American Express is able to 
sell its merchants information on and analysis of its cardholders' spending behaviors, allowing the merchant to engage in more 
effective targeted marketing or identify new locations for geographic expansion, among other applications."" Am. Express Co., 88 
F. Supp. 3d at 159."
116,37," These exclusionary rules were the subject of the litigation in United States v. Visa U.S.A., Inc., 344 F.3d 229 (2d Cir. 2003). "
117,38," In accordance with the Durbin Amendment, Amex's NDPs do not prevent merchants from offering discounts or otherwise 
steering customers to use cash, check, debit, or automated clearing house (""ACH"") transfers. Plaintiffs in this litigation have not 
challenged the NDPs insofar as they prohibit merchants from imposing fees when accepting Amex cards that are not ""imposed 
equally on all Other Payment Products,"" nor have Plaintiffs challenged the NDPs to the extent that they prohibit merchants from 
""mischaracteriz[ing]"" the Card or ""engag[ing] in activities that harm [Amex's] business or the American Express Brand (or both)."" 
See Am. Compl. ¶ 28, ECF Dkt. No. 53 (quoting Amex's Standard NDPs)."
117,39," Not all merchants are bound by Amex's standard NDPs. Certain merchants, including [**24]  Sears, Crate & Barrel, Home 
Depot, and Hilton Hotels & Resorts, have negotiated the right to steer toward their private label or co-brand cards. Even these 
merchants, however, remain subject to restrictions on whether and how they can influence a customer's payment-card choice at 
the point of sale."
117,40," The seventeen states are Maryland, Missouri, Vermont, Utah, Arizona, New Hampshire, Connecticut, Iowa, Michigan, Ohio, 
Texas, Illinois, Tennessee, Montana, Nebraska, Idaho, and Rhode Island. Though Hawaii was originally an eighteenth Plaintiff 
State, it stipulated [**26]  to the dismissal of its claims without prejudice before trial. "
119,41," Though the Supreme Court once suggested in a footnote that vertical price restraints might warrant differential treatment 
under the law from vertical non-price [**31]  restraints, see Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., 433 U.S. 36, 51 n.18, 97 
S. Ct. 2549, 53 L. Ed. 2d 568 (1977), it later clarified that there is ""little economic justification"" for any differential treatment, 
Leegin, 551 U.S. at 904. Accordingly, both vertical price restraints and vertical non-price restraints are analyzed under the rule of 
reason. "
120,42," Both the Plaintiffs and the District Court flagged alleged distinctions between the NDPs and other vertical restraints, see Am. 
Express Co., 88 F. Supp. 3d at 168; Appellee's Br. at 50-51, in apparent attempts to recast the vertical restraints as horizontal. 
We have never drawn this type of distinction between any varieties of vertical restraints and decline to do so here. Moreover, 
because we apply the rule of reason to both vertical and horizontal restraints, see supra note 41 and accompanying text, we find 
that any such distinction is without meaningful difference to the antitrust analysis in this case. "
121,43," See, e.g., Richard A. Posner, Vertical Restraints and Antitrust Policy, 72 U. Chi. L. Rev. 229, 240 (2005) (""Another name for 
[loyalty] might be low transaction costs and customer inertia, which might be another name for economizing on transaction 
costs.""); Benjamin Klein, Andres V. Lerner, Kevin M. Murphy, Lacey L. Plache, Competition in Two-Sided Markets: The 
Antitrust [**36]  Economics of Payment Card Interchange Fees, 73 ANTITRUST L.J. 571, 574 (2006) (""Letting merchants who have 
agreed to accept a payment card and display the payment system's symbol decide which of the system's cards to accept and 
which to reject would impose a significant cost on the payment system's brand name by undermining consumer expectations of 
guaranteed acceptance. . . . Such demands would impose an externality on the entire payment card system, and eventually lead 
some merchants to drop acceptance of the payment system's cards.""). "
122,44," For a graphical depiction of the salient differences, see infra App. Figure 5. "
123,45," We note briefly that the District Court apparently did not use its own relevant market definition when analyzing both 
anticompetitive effects and market power. The District Court defined ""network services"" as no more than the services provided 
by a payment-card platform ""to facilitate the use and acceptance of its payment cards."" Am. Express Co., 88 F. Supp. 3d at 157. 
It then recognized explicitly that the network fee comprises only one part of the full merchant-discount rate subtracted from the 
merchant's profit at the point-of-sale. See id. at 157 (""[T]he merchant discount fee is primarily comprised of three elements: a 
percentage interchange fee, an acquirer fee, and a network fee.""). These findings notwithstanding, the District Court analyzed 
anticompetitive effects with respect to the full merchant-discount rate, not simply the fees associated with ""network services."" 
See, e.g., id. at 215 (finding that ""American Express's merchant restraints have allowed all four networks to raise their swipe 
fees more easily and more profitably than would have been possible were merchants permitted to influence their customers' 
payment decisions""); id. at 219 (concluding that removal of Amex's [**45]  NDPs would ""result in lower swipe fees charged to 
merchants""). We need not decide here whether this inconsistency constitutes error because, in any event, the District Court 
defined the relevant market incorrectly. "
124,46," Plaintiffs' own expert, Dr. Michael Katz, recognized that an increase in the value of cardholder rewards is ""equivalent to a price 
decrease"" to cardholders. App. 919."
124,47," Amex argues that its 26.4% market share ""is a red flag that counsels against a finding [of] market power"" because ""no court in 
any circuit has ever found that a firm violated Section 1 with a share of the relevant market below 30 percent absent proof of 
horizontal collusion, and courts in this Circuit have recognized that 'firms with market shares of less than 30% are presumptively 
incapable of exercising market power.'"" Amex Br. 70 (quoting Commercial Data Servers, Inc. v. Int'l Bus. Machs. Corp., 262 F. 
Supp. 2d 50, 74 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) (internal quotation marks omitted) (collecting cases)). The District Court rejected this [**49]  
argument in a footnote stating that ""[m]arket share is but one factor considered when attempting to approximate a defendant 
firm's power in a relevant market, and that a firm's share falls below some arbitrary threshold cannot disprove allegations of 
market power without reference to the other competitive dynamics at play."" Id. at 189 n.23. Though we agree with the District 
Court that market share is ""one factor"" relevant to market power analysis, we decline to establish any strict threshold of market 
share sufficient to establish a § 1 violation. "
125,48," The District Court found that the price discrimination evidence was of ""limited probative value"" because Plaintiffs did not 
provide any reliable measure of Amex's per-transaction margins across its industry groups. Am. Express Co., 88 F. Supp. 3d at 
198. Similarly, although the District Court received evidence of merchant pricing premiums, it concluded ultimately that ""given 
the absence of clarity with respect to whether Amex maintains a premium in today's market and whether such premium is or has 
been justified by the network's differentiated value propositions, the court finds Plaintiffs' evidence of Amex's pricing premium to 
be of limited utility in the present market power analysis,"" id. at 202."
125,49, See supra note 46. 
126,50," For similar reasons, a doctor may choose to not accept American Express from her patients for co-payments. The high cost of 
merchant fees from American Express may cut in to the doctor's profit margins, and the doctor has little concern about ""marquee 
buyers."" Her patients come to her because they think she is a good doctor—and even if her patients would prefer some frequent 
flyer miles from using a credit card for the co-payment they won't switch doctors just for the miles. "
127,51," One of the ironies of this case is that the government, which usually worries about oligopolists engaging in indirect collusion 
leading to pricing similarities, seeks relief in this case that might drive the three cards to greater similarities. Indeed, the 
differences between the major payment cards have narrowed over time, as one might expect from healthy competition. The 
relief sought by the government in this case could even increase market concentration by reducing Amex's share to Visa's and 
MasterCard's benefit."
127,52," The District Court also concluded that Plaintiffs offered sufficient proof of harm on the cardholder side of the market in the form 
of higher retail prices. This conclusion is erroneous, as it fails to take into account offsetting benefits to cardholders in the form of 
rewards and other services. "
128,53, See supra note 31.

145,1," The following facts are taken from the Amended Complaint, filed on October 20, 2015. (Doc. No. 30 (""Amended Complaint"" or

163,5," While Amphastar's complaint contains similar allegations as those found in Plaintiff's complaint, Judge Gorton's decision to

166,7," Notably, not all of the party witnesses identified by Sandoz reside in Massachusetts; some reside in New Jersey, and one 
resides in Colorado. "
167,8," Additionally, and significantly, the parties in George had conducted discovery specifically to evaluate the appropriateness of 
transfer, with the Court ultimately determining that the plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate an adequate connection between the 
Southern District of Illinois and the case's subject matter. See 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18650, [WL] at *5 (""Even after conducting 
discovery with respect to transfer, Plaintiffs simply have not been able to show very much of a nexus between this District and 
this case.""). "
168,9," At worst, the Court would decline to give any weight to this factor. As noted, while a transfer to Massachusetts would be more 
convenient for Dr. Shriver and Ms. Trivinos, it would be inconvenient for Plaintiff's witnesses, and would not create any less 
inconvenience for the other non-party witnesses located outside of Massachusetts."
168,10," In this age of technology, production of documents is much [*27]  less tied to a specific locale."

169,14," While Judge Gorton is undoubtedly familiar with the facts that are similar to both this case and the Patent Action, and by 
necessity is also likely familiar with some of the legal issues in this case, Defendants presented no argument that he is uniquely 
familiar with antitrust law. The Court therefore assigns no weight to this consideration. "

187,1," iPic's petition alleges that AMC contacted the same six distributors and informed them that AMC's megaplex in Frisco, Texas 
would be clearing iPic's planned theater in Frisco. iPic alleges, based on the timing of Regal and AMC's communications with 
distributors, that Regal and AMC conspired to drive iPic theaters out of business. These allegations notwithstanding, the 
temporary injunction does not mention AMC, and AMC is not a party to this appeal. Accordingly, we confine our analysis to the 
claims asserted against Regal. "
188,2," Allocation is the process by which distributors choose, in the context of a clearance, to license some films to one theater and 
other films to the other. "
196,3," Because we have concluded that the trial court did not abuse [**34]  its discretion in concluding that iPic demonstrated a 
probable right to relief on its unlawful restraint-of-trade claim, and that claim is sufficient to support the temporary injunction, we 
do not address Pic's three other claims—monopolization, attempted monopolization, and tortious interference with contracts and 
prospective business relationships. "

217,3," The Laumann court also relied on the Sports Broadcasting Act (""SBA""), 15 U.S.C. § 1291, ""which created an antitrust 
exemption for certain types of professional sports broadcasting agreements, particularly league-wide contracts for over-the-air 
broadcasts."" Laumann, 56 F. Supp. 3d at 293. The court found that Congress's passage of this statute in 1961 indicates that 
""Congress understood sports broadcasting agreements to fall outside the baseball exemption. The provision of the SBA granting 
limited immunity to a narrow category of broadcasting agreements would be meaningless if all baseball broadcasting 
agreements were already covered by the common law exemption."" Id. at 295 (emphasis in original). "

231,3," We use ""TLI"" as shorthand for a group of small service providers that are under common ownership and control and are 
collectively the appellees/cross-appellants. They include Telecom Labs, Inc. (""TLI""), TeamTLI.com Corp., and Continuant, Inc., 
along with their common owners and managers Douglas Graham, Scott Graham, and Bruce Shelby. Although Continuant 
seemingly took over the businesses' continuing interests beginning in 2005, TLI was the firm most involved in this dispute from 
the beginning, so we use that name for simplicity. [**5]"
231,4," The reasons for the divorce are, of course, like everything else in this case, hotly contested, and they are elaborated in more 
detail below. Here is a thumbnail sketch: Avaya contends that TLI violated its obligations as an Avaya agent, whereas TLI "
232,," alleges that Avaya imposed onerous surprise conditions to prevent a partner firm like TLI from recouping the investments it had 
made at Avaya's request."
232,5," Those statistics are based on PBXs sold before 2000. In the 2000s, traditional PBXs were replaced with systems that use 
internet protocol telephony. Whereas with older ""refrigerator-box-type PBXs, it was ... easy to identify and define what a ... life of 
a system was,"" with the ""IP PBXs ... any one server might come out of service, perhaps [**8]  as quickly as after just a couple ... 
years."" (J.A. 4382.) Given the constant replacement of equipment on those modern PBXs, it is ""very difficult to measure"" what 
the lifetime of a system is. (Id.)"
232,6," The use of the word ""feature"" to describe elements of the software that enabled remote maintenance is legally relevant [**9]  to 
questions of contract interpretation in this case. See infra Part II.A.2. We use the word here as a generic term, without implying 
anything about how it should be read in the specific context of Avaya's contracts with its customers. "
233,7," The Avaya expert who testified about the change in policy suggested that the reason for the change was that the features 
available for purchase on the PBXs had become so numerous that Avaya began including many of them by default."
233,8," See United Asset Coverage, Inc. v. Avaya Inc., 409 F. Supp. 2d 1008, 1046 (N.D. Ill. 2006). That court's analysis was critical of 
the kind of monopolization and tying claims now brought by TLI. Because ""the software built into Avaya's PBXs to facilitate their 
maintenance and repair is proprietary,"" the court rejected the argument that maintenance and hardware were separate antitrust 
markets. Id. at 1045-46. It also rejected the claim that Avaya had surprised its customers with a post-sale policy change, 
characterizing that monopolization claim as ""border[ing] on the absurd"" because ""[n]o one has an unclouded crystal ball as to 
future events, nor does anyone have a vested right in the expectation that the future will remain the same as the present."" Id. at 
1046."
233,9," The phrase ""PDS system"" is redundant (because the ""S"" in PDS is ""system""), but we use it for its colloquial ease, as the District 
Court did. "
234,10," Because of the relatively small size of the PDS maintenance market, none of Avaya's Business Partners has become a PDS 
maintenance provider."
234,11," Most issues before us are raised by Avaya, against whom the District Court entered judgment as a matter of law and against 
which a verdict was rendered. Nonetheless, both sides have appealed a variety of issues, and we endeavor to recount the facts 
neutrally."
234,12," Avaya had laid off many of its service technicians and engineers, and it offered to subsidize their salaries if Business Partners 
would employ them and begin to offer maintenance services."
234,13," Formally, there [**17]  were two Avaya One agreements in place, one between Avaya and TLI and one between Avaya and 
TeamTLI.com. For the TLI agreement, Avaya invoked the termination clause on July 31, 2003, so that it terminated on 
September 30. The TeamTLI.com agreement was finalized on July 24, Avaya served notice it was cancelling on September 24, 
and the termination was effective November 24. Because the agreement with TLI was the principal subject of Avaya's breach of "
235,," contract claims, and because the District Court analyzed the two contracts in tandem, for simplicity we do not address them 
separately because there is no substantive difference that we are aware of, and the difference in termination dates is irrelevant."
235,14," By the time of that Complaint, Avaya's claims against TLI were, in full, the following: misappropriation of trade secrets, tortious 
interference with contractual relations, tortious interference with prospective [**21]  economic advantage, fraud/ 
misrepresentation, violations of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, false advertising and violations of the Lanham Act, trade 
libel and commercial disparagement, breach of contract, unfair competition, unjust enrichment, breach of the duty of loyalty, 
aiding and abetting former Avaya employees' misuse of proprietary information, and conspiracy"
235,15," Specifically, TLI alleged the following antitrust violations: monopolization and attempted monopolization of the PBX 
maintenance market in violation of § 2 of the Sherman Act, tying PBX maintenance and software patches in violation of § 1 of 
the Sherman Act, tying PBX upgrades and maintenance in violation of § 1 of the Sherman Act, monopolization and attempted "
236,," monopolization of the PDS maintenance market in violation of § 2 of the Sherman Act, tying PDS maintenance and software 
patches in violation of § 1 of the Sherman Act, tying PDS maintenance and upgrades in violation of § 1 of the Sherman Act, and 
conspiracy in violation of § 1 of the Sherman Act. TLI also asserted common law counterclaims: tortious interference with 
business/contractual relations, tortious interference with prospective business or economic advantage, injurious falsehood and 
trade libel/slander, [**22]  and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing."
236,16," Those claims included misappropriation of trade secrets, tortious interference with contractual relations, violations of the 
Digital Millennium Copyright Act, violations of the Lanham Act, trade libel and commercial disparagement, and breach of the duty 
of loyalty. "
237,17," The District Court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1332, and 1367. We exercise jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 
1291."
237,18," Avaya does not appeal the grant of judgment as a matter of law against its claims for civil conspiracy, aiding and abetting a 
breach of loyalty, and unjust enrichment. "
240,19," Avaya presented a specific example through the testimony of one maintenance client who was courted by TLI. That witness 
testified that his firm had traditionally [**38]  used Avaya maintenance (either directly or through Business Partners), switched to 
TLI under the mistaken belief that it was a Business Partner, then terminated that arrangement upon discovering that TLI was 
not ""able to provide [them] with the proper login credentials to support and administer the system"" and thereafter ""went back to 
Avaya for support."" (J.A. 2510.) Avaya therefore presented not only generalized evidence that TLI's maintenance contracts were 
at Avaya's expense, but a concrete example of how that substitution worked."
240,20," Indeed, Douglas Graham noted in an email that Avaya would frequently take losses in order to retain its extant maintenance 
contracts, another facet of TLI's competitive strategy: TLI continues to have significant success in taking over existing Avaya maintenance contracts. Even when TLI loses, in 
most cases Avaya has to take a significant loss to win the deal. For example, TLI just lost International Paper. At the time of "
241,," TLI's proposal, International Paper was paying Avaya over $4,000,000 a year. TLI's proposal was for $2,800,000 a year. I 
have not gotten all the details, but I am confident that Avaya had to partner with a Business Partner and take a significant 
loss to keep TLI from winning this deal. (J.A. 6363.)"
241,21," Not incidentally, a maintenance relationship either directly with Avaya or with an authorized Business [**40]  Partner also 
allowed Avaya to assert quality control over maintenance, which helped protect the value of Avaya's brand reputation. When it 
came to independent providers, Avaya was ""concerned about the quality of maintenance service that the customer receives."" 
(J.A. 2065.) "
242,22," In 2003, Avaya updated the agreements. It left the quoted language in place but added a new clause stating that the 
""[c]ustomer will make the Software available only to employees, contractors, or consultants with a need to know, who are 
obligated to comply with all license restrictions contained in the Agreement and to maintain the secrecy of the Software."" (E.g., 
J.A. 5241.) The District Court interpreted the language about ""contractors[] or consultants"" to be ""consistent with the ... 
construction of licensing agreements that allow third-party use for the licensee's benefit."" (J.A. 205 n.26.) It therefore considered 
that contract term to be evidence that PBX owners were permitted to use independent contractors for maintenance and to 
provide them with system access. "
243,23," TLI argues that, in Avaya's ""detailed 'feature' manuals,"" Avaya ""did not once identify MSPs as a 'feature.'"" (Answering Br. at 84 
(citing J.A. 2407).) We agree that testimony about those features manuals, and the absence of any mention of MSPs in them, 
would be relevant for the jury to consider in interpreting the meaning of the 1999 modifications. But, as an Avaya system 
engineer put it at trial, the PBX software is ""able to do a vast number of things,"" and customers could pick and choose which 
""aspects of the software"" to purchase. (J.A. 1886.) That Avaya chose to highlight more glamorous capacities in its 
features [**49]  manuals — instead of intermediate commands and functions that allowed remote-access maintenance — does 
not foreclose a jury determination that such access was indeed a feature of the product. Given that so few customers performed 
their own maintenance, that lack of emphasis may make perfect sense to a jury."
243,24," The District Court made note of the fact that only ""eight out of [TLI's] 470 customers purchased their PBXs in 2007 or after,"" 
and that the 2007 contract modification ""came into existence well after Avaya [**50]  initiated the instant suit in June of 2006."" 
(J.A. 206-07 n.27.) Although allegedly unlawful access to post-2007 systems may not have been a large contributor of TLI's 
business or the motivation for Avaya's suit, that goes to the question of damages, not liability."
243,25," The agreement provided that the ""[c]ustomer agrees not to ... allow any service provider or third party, with the exception of 
Avaya's authorized channel resellers and their designated employees ... to use or execute any software commands that cause 
the software to perform functions that facilitate the maintenance or repair of any Product except that a service provider ... may 
execute those software commands that ... would operate if ... [MSPs] were not enabled or activated."" (J.A. 7283.) "
244,26," We earlier parsed New Jersey law to further subdivide the tort, essentially by breaking out the second part of the Ideal Dairy 
Farms formulation into three elements. As we put it then, the tort comprised five elements:"
244,1," ) a plaintiff's reasonable expectation of economic benefit or advantage, (2) the defendant's knowledge of that expectancy, 
(3) the defendant's wrongful, intentional interference with that expectancy, (4) in the absence of interference, the 
reasonable probability that the plaintiff would have received the anticipated economic benefit, and (5) damages resulting 
from the defendant's interference. Fineman v. Armstrong World Indus., Inc., 980 F.2d 171, 186 (3d Cir. 1992) (citing Printing Mart, 563 A.2d at 37; Restatement 
(Second) of Torts § 766B))."
244,27," Printing Mart illustrates how broad a protectable prospective economic advantage may be. The corporate plaintiff had 
performed printing services for Sharp Electronics for several years. When Printing Mart submitted a bid on the latest Sharp 
project, there was evidence that Sharp employees rigged the bidding process to enable a Printing Mart [**54]  competitor to win 
the contract. Printing Mart sued Sharp, three of its employees, and three competitors for intentional interference with prospective "
245,," economic relations. The trial court dismissed the complaint on the basis that no contract obligated Sharp to do business with 
Printing Mart. The Supreme Court of New Jersey reversed, holding that, although a complaint based on tortious interference 
must allege facts that show a protectable right, the right ""need not equate with that found in an enforceable contract."" Printing 
Mart, 563 A.2d at 37. "
246,28," The District Court cited Printing Mart, 563 A.2d at 37, for the proposition that New Jersey courts have adopted the multi-factor 
test from the Restatement. In fact, Printing Mart adopted § 766B, but subsequent case law from the Supreme Court of New 
Jersey suggests that § 767 is also persuasive. See Nostrame v. Santiago, 213 N.J. 109, 61 A.3d 893, 901 (N.J. 2013) (""In 
determining whether the conduct complained of is improper, the Restatement offers general guidance, identifying a variety of 
relevant considerations."" (citing Restatement (Second) of Torts § 767))."
246,29," Although the District Court was not explicit in enumerating which factors of the Restatement's seven-factor test it was 
considering, we infer from its argument that it here considered factors (a), (b), and (d) together — respectively, the nature of 
TLI's conduct, its motive, and the interests it sought to advance. "
247,30," Other business torts — including tortious interference — can themselves support an unfair competition claim. Coast Cities, 
912 F. Supp. at 786. Our conclusion that the tortious interference claim should have proceeded to the jury is itself sufficient to 
overturn the judgment as a matter of law on the unfair competition claim. Our analysis here focuses on those aspects of unfair 
competition that are distinct from tortious interference. "
248,31," See [**68]  also Restatement (Third) of Unfair Competition § 45 (1995) (""One who is liable to another for an appropriation of 
the other's trade secret ... is liable for the pecuniary loss to the other caused by the appropriation or for the actor's own pecuniary 
gain resulting from the appropriation, whichever is greater ... .""). "
250,32," Whereas the customer contracts referenced above in Part II.A.2 were for PBX systems, the dealer agreements between 
Avaya and TLI are worded broadly enough to reach both the PBX and PDS markets. Insofar as Avaya's breach of contract 
allegations rely primarily on improper access to ODMCs and MSPs, however, the breach of contract claim is principally focused 
on the larger PBX market. "
251,33," As an Avaya executive testified at trial, the purpose of that provision was ""to protect [Avaya's] software assets going forward if 
there is information that a Business Partner gets, [and] also to make sure that nothing gets turned on subsequent[ to] 
termination."" (J.A. 2116.)"
251,34," Section 17.6 of the agreement provided that ""the termination of the Agreement shall not prejudice or otherwise affect ... any ... 
obligations of the parties, such as those arising under [Section 7], which by their nature continue beyond termination of the 
Agreement and which shall survive such termination."" (J.A. 6959.) "
252,35," Although our dissenting colleague's ""assessment of Avaya's case-in-chief is the same as the District Court's"" (Dissenting Op. 
at 3-4), he has sufficient ""doubt about the propriety of the District Court's decision"" that he focuses his opinion on other issues 
(id. at 4). We therefore let our analysis of the District Court's error speak for itself as a response to that portion of the Dissent. "
253,36," Moreover, as we explain in more detail below, under the specific theory of antitrust liability pressed by TLI, if Avaya's sales 
contracts had established that using independent service providers was prohibited, then [**83]  any remedy to infirmities in that 
arrangement would lie ""in contract, not under the antitrust laws."" Queen City Pizza, 124 F.3d at 441. Therefore, to the extent that 
Avaya's interpretation of its customer contracts was correct, that would have added a very potent weapon to Avaya's arsenal to 
combat the specific theory of antitrust liability argued by TLI. But Avaya was precluded from making that argument because the 
District Court erroneously adopted a definitive construction of those contracts, as a matter of law, in service of its Rule 50 
decision."
253,37," At least twice more, TLI strongly emphasized the importance of the District Court's jury instructions. For instance, it told the 
jury that ""[w]hen TLI started to compete with Avaya, it had every right to do so. TLI's use and access to maintenance software "
254,," that's embedded in these systems, you should not consider to be unlawful. You will hear that instruction from the judge 
tomorrow."" (J.A. 4733.) Later, it reminded the jury: ""Again, you will be instructed by the Court tomorrow, that you are not to 
consider TLI's access to or use of the maintenance software, including MSPs and ODMs, called ODMCs and maintenance 
software permissions, as in any way unlawful use of that maintenance software."" (J.A. 4734.)"
254,38," As we read the Dissent, its objection to our conclusion comes down to its premise that ""Avaya had ample opportunity to 
present the jury with legitimate and procompetitive defenses for its actions."" (Dissenting Op. at 10.) To be sure, Avaya mounted 
a vigorous defense notwithstanding the limitations it faced as a result of the Rule 50 ruling, but we lack the Dissent's confidence 
that it is ""highly probable that the error did not affect the outcome of the case."" Glass v. Phila. Elec. Co., 34 F.3d 188, 191 (3d 
Cir. 1994) (quotation marks and citation omitted). A jury may well have evaluated Avaya's conduct differently if Avaya were 
simply enforcing its contractual rights or combating tortious activity, as TLI itself recognized by its repeated emphasis in its 
summation that its actions could not be considered unlawful. The Dissent betrays the importance of the lawfulness determination 
when it says that Avaya's ""defenses did not depend on whether TLI's conduct was [**87]  so egregious as to be against the law."" 
(Id.) The special egregiousness of unlawful conduct is precisely the argument that Avaya wanted to make — and was deprived 
from making — to the jury. This is also where the Dissent's ""David and Goliath"" analogy breaks down. Avaya was certainly the bigger competitor, but TLI 
was no plucky little company armed only with the business equivalent of a sling and a few stones. It was a sophisticated and 
aggressive company, which, at least according to Avaya and a great deal of the evidence at trial, was prepared to, and did, 
engage in what even the Dissent acknowledges were ""deceitful and/or unethical"" business methods. (Id. at 2.) Since those 
methods were such that the jury could have found them unlawful, the Rule 50 error was not harmless. "
255,39," We have been shown nothing in the record suggesting that Avaya acknowledged that it had ""no legal basis"" to send the so-
called FUD letters. To the contrary, Avaya's entire affirmative case relied in large part on a belief that TLI's unauthorized 
provision of maintenance services did lead customers to breach their contracts with Avaya. On appeal, Avaya continues to argue 
that the FUD letters were truthful."
255,40," The Dissent contends that ""[e]ven if the jury had not been instructed that unauthorized access to Avaya software was not 
illegal, it is unlikely that it would have reached a different verdict."" (Dissenting Op. at 13.) The Dissent says that Avaya seemed 
to concede that the FUD letters included some ""over-the-top"" prose (id.), but be that as it may, the degree to which those 
letters [**90]  were legitimate surely depended on the truth of the legal assertions in them. If Avaya was correct in its assertions 
that unauthorized access was unlawful — a question taken away from the jury by virtue of the Rule 50 decision — then the 
letters arguably contain defensible statements of law. That could make a world of difference to a jury in evaluating the 
truthfulness and competitive legitimacy of the letters."
255,41," The basis for the field-clearing argument was that because Avaya restricted its Business Partners from competing with it for 
maintenance business, when TLI sought to lure customers from Avaya, it did not have to compete with any of those Business 
Partners, who were precluded from seeking that business. In that way, the expert opined, TLI benefited from much of the 
allegedly anticompetitive conduct over which it filed suit because that conduct restricted TLI's competition as much as it did 
Avaya's."
255,42," The Dissent suggests that any limitations placed on Avaya's defense as a result of the Rule 50 ruling were merely ""rhetorical,"" 
and that being able to argue the illegality of TLI's conduct ""would not have changed the substance of Avaya's procompetitive-
justification argument."" (Dissenting Op. at 12.) We disagree. It is one thing to explain to a jury that sharp-elbowed tactics were 
taken to retaliate against aggressive but completely lawful activities of a competitor. It is altogether different to be able to argue 
that the restraints of trade at issue were necessary to enforce Avaya's contractual rights and to deter fraudulent and tortious 
interference with Avaya's legitimate business interests. "
256,43," The Dissent would not even reach the question of whether the District Court's erroneous Rule 50 order infected the antitrust 
verdict, on the ground that Avaya forfeited any argument of spill-over prejudice. That position seems to us to result from the 
Dissent's separate (and, in our estimation, incorrect) view that any prejudicial effect on the jury's consideration of the antitrust 
counterclaims was tangential and minor. We agree with our dissenting colleague that, ""[i]f a claim of error is unaccompanied by 
developed argument, it is forfeited."" (Dissenting Op. at 6 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).) In this case, however, 
the claim of error — that the District Court's Rule 50 decision was improper — was indisputably fully briefed and argued. Avaya's 
position that the erroneous Rule 50 ruling tainted the antitrust verdict was made as a request for a particular form of relief to 
correct that error. The request was brief but the brevity is unsurprising, given how inextricably linked Avaya's rule [**95]  of 
reason antitrust defense was to its claims that TLI's actions were unlawful. Avaya could reasonably have expected TLI's answer 
simply to contest Avaya's claim of error as to the Rule 50 ruling, as TLI in fact did contest at length. As it happened, however, 
TLI also raised a separate argument, as an alternative basis to affirm, that any error was harmless as to the antitrust verdict. 
Avaya then provided a rebuttal to that assertion of harmlessness with exactly the kind of responsive argumentation we would 
expect in a reply brief. Cf. Becker v. ARCO Chem. Co., 207 F.3d 176, 205 (3d Cir. 2000) (considering and rejecting a harmless 
error argument raised for the first time by the appellee at oral argument and only then countered by the appellant)."
256,44," The parties also dispute the propriety of the injunctive relief ordered by the District Court. Because we will vacate the verdict 
and judgment of liability, we must also vacate the resulting injunction. "
257,45," TLI secured verdicts against Avaya under both §§ 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. Section 1 declares illegal ""[e]very contract, 
combination ..., or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce."" 15 U.S.C. § 1. Section 2 makes unlawful any act to 
""monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire ... to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce."" 15 U.S.C. § 
2. "
259,46," In Queen City Pizza, we talked, in part, of the defendant forcing ""plaintiffs to purchase the [**106]  ... tying product."" 124 F.3d 
at 443 (emphasis added). That language was a result of the idiosyncratic nature of one of the tying theories alleged in that case. 
Under that theory, the primary market was for restaurant franchise agreements, which in turn contractually bound franchisees to 
purchase the alleged ""tying"" product, fresh dough. The franchisees contended that Domino's ""refused to sell fresh dough to 
[them] unless [they] purchased other ingredients and supplies from Domino's,"" id. at 434, so that the ""other ingredients and 
supplies"" were the ""tied"" product. The analogy here would be an argument that the primary market was for PBX systems, which ""forced"" the purchase of ODMCs 
and MSPs as the ""tying"" products, which were in turn allegedly used to force purchase of maintenance as the ""tied"" service. No 
matter how many intermediate steps are alleged, however, in the end our concern is whether the defendant forced purchases of 
a tied product using power in some distinct market. Jefferson Parish, 466 U.S. at 12. Queen City Pizza stands for the proposition 
that if the supposed forcing is entirely the result of a transparent contractual agreement, then that is not the concern of the 
antitrust laws. A plaintiff cannot avoid that outcome merely [**107]  by crafting a complaint to allege intermediate steps. "
260,47," We also affirmed summary judgment against the § 1 tying claim raised in Harrison Aire because ""[t]ying requires appreciable 
economic power in the tying product market,"" and the plaintiff ""fail[ed] to produce any evidence of appreciable market power in 
the tying product market"" for hot air balloons. 423 F.3d at 385 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). "
261,48," As that treatise explains those two elements in greater detail: [**113] HN25[
] when a defendant has no power in the [primary] market, it cannot profitably charge supracompetitive prices for 
unique [aftermarket products] to ""locked in"" users unless:"
261,1," . it can profitably abandon selling new machines to sophisticated new customers who would understand that the 
machine's cost is the sum of its nominal price plus the excess [maintenance] charges later ...; or"
261,2," . it can price discriminate by identifying and overcharging only unsophisticated users and thus assuring competitive ... 
prices for new, sophisticated customers. Unless one of these conditions is satisfied, the defendant without power in the [primary] market also lacks the power to 
charge supracompetitive prices for unique [aftermarket products]. Areeda & Hovenkamp, Fundamentals, supra, § 5.12, at 5-102 to 103. In a companion treatise, those scholars suggest going even further to limit the reach of Kodak in circumstances of competitive 
primary markets: Kodak does not foreclose a rebuttable presumption that lack of power in the relevant primary market (such as equipment) 
implies a lack of substantial power in derivative markets (such as parts or service). Indeed, Kodak may even allow a 
conclusive presumption to this effect in order to simplify [**114]  administration of the antitrust laws. Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, 10 Antitrust Law ¶ 1740, at 133 (3d ed. 2011). "
262,49," As a reminder, those surviving antitrust counterclaims are for attempted monopolization in the PBX maintenance services 
market, in violation of § 2 of the Sherman Act; and tying PDS software patches to maintenance services, in violation of §1 of the 
Sherman Act. Given the arguments before us, ours is not to reason why the jury found those particular counterclaims [**116]  
compelling while rejecting the rest. ""We exercise plenary review"" over a district court's decision on whether to grant judgment as a matter of law against a jury 
verdict, but we ""must not weigh evidence, engage in credibility determinations, or substitute [our] version of the facts for the 
jury's."" Pitts v. Delaware, 646 F.3d 151, 155 (3d Cir. 2011). "
263,50," TLI seeks to downplay the effect of the post-2008 customer agreements by arguing that they were ""boilerplate"" and 
""ambiguous"" (Answering Br. at 36), and by arguing that there was ""no evidence that any post-May 2008 Avaya PBX purchasers 
signed the form contracts"" (id. at 38). We conclude that there is no reason to disturb the District Court's factual findings or legal 
conclusion on this point. The contractual language is unambiguous, and TLI's own CEO acknowledged the language's clarity 
and its use beginning with the new PBX systems introduced in 2008. "
264,51," Our reading of Kodak further bolsters our conclusion that the District Court's judgment as a matter of law on Avaya's common 
law claims necessarily prejudiced the antitrust verdict. Protecting itself from [**124]  tortious forms of competition may well have 
been a valid business reason to engage in defensive exclusionary conduct, and that kind of affirmative defense was the crux of 
the Kodak opinion's § 2 analysis. That Avaya was not able to make such an argument to the jury improperly hindered its defense 
against TLI's § 2 claims. "
266,52," Moreover, the damages expert's two models projected damages of between $133 million and $147 million, a far cry from the 
jury's finding of $20 million in damages. In trying to figure out what portion of that award was attributable to which systems, we 
would have a hard time reasoning how the jury came to its number in the first place, much less how much is attributable to a 
liability theory that survives this appeal."
266,53," The parties also fight over the jury instructions, but those are arguments we need not resolve because we are vacating the 
verdict on other grounds. Some comment is nevertheless in order. Avaya complains that the District Court simply gave the jury a 
list of factors to consider in an ""uncabined"" manner to determine whether the primary market was dissociated from the 
maintenance aftermarket. (Opening Br. at 52.) Although there is some merit to that complaint, there is also much to applaud in 
the District Court's efforts to distill and describe this complex area of law for the jury. In particular, we appreciate [**131]  that the 
Court properly identified from Kodak and our precedents relevant factors for the jury's consideration. We agree, however, that — if there is a retrial — the Court should consider describing to the jury a logical path for it to follow in 
evaluating whether the primary market is dissociated from the aftermarket. For example, with respect to the PBX attempted 
monopolization claim, a theory of dissociation by aftermarket surprise in this case might run as follows:"
266,1," . If you find that customers could not have predicted that Avaya would condition their use of MSPs and ODMCs on 
customers' refusal to use ISPs, you may conclude that Avaya enacted a surprise aftermarket policy change."
266,2," . If you determine that Avaya enacted such an aftermarket policy change, you must then evaluate whether Avaya had the 
ability to exercise market power in the aftermarket. To reach such a conclusion, you must conclude that Avaya and its 
Business Partners were able to exclude competitors in the aftermarket, and that switching costs in the primary market 
locked in customers."
266,3," . If you determine that Avaya enacted a surprise aftermarket policy change and that it had market power in the 
aftermarket, you may then [**132]  decide whether it was possible for Avaya to use that market power to exploit customers. 
To find the possibility of exploitation, you must conclude that Avaya had the ability to charge supracompetitive prices in the 
aftermarket."
266,4," . If, and only if, you reach all three of the prior conclusions, may you find that the PBX maintenance market was a relevant 
antitrust aftermarket. The foregoing example is not meant as a directive that the District Court must follow, but rather as one proposed approach to 
""channel"" — as Avaya puts it — the jury's consideration of the factors identified in Kodak. (Opening Br. at 53.) Avaya also appealed the District Court's decision to grant TLI prejudgment interest on the basis of what it determined to be 
Avaya's vexatious litigation strategy. Because we vacate the verdict and the corresponding damages award, the issue of 
prejudgment interest is moot, and we decline to address it. The question may be considered afresh, if necessary, following 
retrial. "
267,54," Our review of a district court's grant of summary judgment is plenary. Boyle v. Cty. of Allegheny Pa., 139 F.3d 386, 393 (3d 
Cir. 1998). ""[S]ummary judgment may be granted if the movant shows that there exists no genuine issue of material fact that 
would permit a reasonable jury to find for the nonmoving party. All facts and inferences are construed in the light most favorable 
to the non[]moving party."" Id. (internal citation and quotation marks omitted)."
267,55," The parties dispute whether the District Court applied the correct legal standards for the tort claims.HN33[
]  For tortious 
interference, ""New Jersey law requires that a plaintiff ... present proof that but for the acts of the defendant, the plaintiff would 
have received the anticipated economic benefits."" Lightning Lube, 4 F.3d at 1168 (internal quotation marks omitted). TLI 
disputes whether the District Court actually applied that ""but for"" test, suggesting that it improperly demanded that TLI prove that 
Avaya's actions were the sole cause of injury. Despite some potentially confusing language, the District Court's opinion did apply 
the ""but for"" test as explicated in Lightning Lube. TLI also argues that the District Court should have instead applied a test 
evaluating whether Avaya's conduct was a ""substantial factor"" in causing TLI's injury. See Verdicchio v. Ricca, 179 N.J. 1, 843 
A.2d 1042, 1056 (N.J. 2004) (applying the ""substantial factor"" test in a medical malpractice case). Because a ""substantial factor"" 
causation test would not have altered the result, we need not consider whether it was more appropriate. With regard to the legal standard for trade libel, both parties [**135]  agree that TLI had to prove special damages. TLI wanted 
the Court to apply a ""material and substantial part"" test for causation of those damage, see Patel v. Soriano, 369 N.J. Super. 
192, 848 A.2d 803, 835 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 2004), whereas Avaya supports the ""natural and direct result"" standard that 
the District Court did apply, see Mayflower Transit, LLC v. Prince, 314 F. Supp. 2d 362, 378 (D.N.J. 2004). Again, we need not 
resolve which standard is correct because the outcome is the same under either."
267,56," At trial, Scott Graham validated the District Court's conclusion when he testified that [**136]  he was ""[n]ot ... aware of"" a case 
in which TLI was not able to get ""into the maintenance software"" of a prospective customer. (J.A. 2443.) In fact, it is ""[c]orrect"" 
that TLI was ""always successful."" (Id.) "
268,57," Other examples provided by TLI were similarly unimpressive. For instance, TLI relied on a cease and desist letter that it sent 
to Avaya in 2010. The District Court concluded that the mere existence of such a letter ""is no more helpful to the Court on 
summary judgment than ... pleadings,"" without additional ""evidence sufficient to prove that the allegations made in the ... letter 
are in fact true."" (J.A. 107.)"
268,58," The expert's credibility is further undermined by the fact that at a subsequent Daubert hearing, the District Court determined 
that he was ""'[c]learly ... not competent' to testify about an individual customer's motivations."" (Third Step Br. at 62 (alteration 
and omission in original) (quoting J.A. 4071).) "
269,59," We note, however, that insofar as TLI may have later developed more evidence on the use of upgrades to tie, that evidence 
remains relevant to TLI's attempted monopolization claim. There is nothing to prevent TLI from presenting the upgrade tying 
theory to the jury as part of its surviving § 2 claim on remand, but that does not ameliorate the fact that its evidence at the 
summary judgment stage was so scant. "
270,60," Which is not to say that we endorse the District Court's determination that the award of prejudgment interest was appropriate 
in this case. Again, Avaya's present challenge to that award has been mooted by our disposition with respect to the other claims 
presented. "
271,1," Although I believe the jury was properly instructed as to the factors for finding a relevant antitrust aftermarket for Avaya PBX 
system maintenance and could have reasonably found Avaya liable for attempted monopolization of that aftermarket prior to its 
introduction of transparent sales contracts in May 2008, I agree with the Majority that Avaya cannot be held liable for PBX 
systems sold after that time. I also agree that the jury could not have reasonably found Avaya liable for tying PDS patches to 
maintenance either before 2007 (the patches were free, so there was no coercion) or after (the conditions were clear upfront, so 
there was no relevant antitrust aftermarket). Moreover, because the general verdict did not dissociate damages stemming from 
attempted monopolization of the PBX maintenance aftermarket from those attributable to the alleged PDS tying, I agree that the 
damages award must be vacated and that we therefore need not reach the issue whether [**151]  the District Court abused its 
discretion in granting TLI's motion for prejudgment interest under the Clayton Act. I also join the Majority's rejection of TLI's 
cross-appeals. "
272,," Finally, I commend Judge Jordan for his rigorous synthesis of the Eastman Kodak Company v. Image Technical Services Inc. 
branch of antitrust law, which has bedeviled litigants and courts alike. I agree with his analysis wholeheartedly. Because the 
District Court's jury instructions comport with the principles outlined by Judge Jordan, I would hold that they were sufficient to 
""properly apprise[] the jury of the issues and the applicable law."" Smith v. Borough of Wilkinsburg, 147 F.3d 272, 275 (3d Cir. 
1998) (quotation marks omitted) (quoting Limbach Co. v. Sheet Metal Workers Int'l Ass'n, AFL-CIO, 949 F.2d 1241, 1259 n.15 
(3d Cir. 1991) (en banc))."
272,2," ""Forfeiture"" and ""waiver"" are often treated as interchangeable terms. As I have explained elsewhere, they are not. See Tri-M 
Grp., LLC v. Sharp, 638 F.3d 406, 432 n.1 (3d Cir. 2011) (Hardiman, J., concurring) (""Whereas forfeiture is the failure to make 
the timely assertion of a right, waiver is the intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right."") (quoting United States 
v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 733, 113 S. Ct. 1770, 123 L. Ed. 2d 508 (1993) (internal quotation marks omitted))."
272,3," See also Rodríguez, 659 F.3d at 175 (""Judges are not mind-readers, so parties must spell out their issues clearly, highlighting 
the relevant facts and analyzing on-point authority."")."
272,4," Two of these instances were little more than ipse dixits. See Avaya Br. 4 (""The erroneous dismissal of Avaya's claims and the 
court's instruction that TLI['s] conduct was not unlawful also tainted the jury's consideration of TLI['s] antitrust counterclaims.""); 
id. at 72 (""In any event, the erroneous instructions that tainted the jury's consideration of TLI['s] ""FUD"" allegations require a new 
trial.""). Neither of these assertions was supported by any reasoning or citation to legal authority or record evidence. The third 
mention of tainting offered a few sentences of additional bluster—accusing the trial judge of ""discredit[ing] Avaya in the jury's 
eyes"" and ""crippl[ing] Avaya's ability to respond to TLI['s] antitrust claims by showing that it had legitimate and procompetitive 
business reasons"" for its actions—but was purely skeletal. Id. at 43 (introductory paragraph to antitrust argument section). Avaya 
again offered no development of its theory or citation to case law or the trial record. Passing references like these should be 
deemed forfeited. See Bryant v. Gates, 532 F.3d 888, 898, 382 U.S. App. D.C. 287 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (holding that a claim was 
forfeited where it was made only in a ""conclusory"" manner because ""[i]t is not enough merely to mention a possible argument in "
273,," the most skeletal [**155]  way, leaving the court to do counsel's work"" (quoting N.Y. Rehab. Care Mgmt., LLC v. NLRB, 506 F.3d 
1070, 1076, 378 U.S. App. D.C. 317 (D.C. Cir. 2007))); Donahue v. City of Boston, 304 F.3d 110, 122 (1st Cir. 2002) 
(determining that an argument was forfeited where the ""main brief devote[d] only three sentences to the issue"" that were ""half-
hearted"" and ""poorly developed"")."
273,5," In its closing argument, after explaining to the jury that it would be instructed that ""TLI's use of and access to Avaya's 
maintenance software may not be considered by you to have been unlawful"" Avaya explained that ""what remains is a series of 
decisions by you, as to whether Avaya's conduct was a reasonable competitive reaction to the events Avaya confronted in the 
marketplace."" Trial Transcript (""Tr."") 3/19/14, 15752. It then proceeded to make the case that Avaya's actions were nothing more 
than ""legitimate efforts to protect its software and its business model,"" id. at 15756; that the law ""allows for fierce, fierce 
competition,"" id. at 15757; that Avaya's practices were consistent with industry practices and business realities [**158]  and that 
the Business Partner program enhanced competition in the marketplace; that its concerns about unauthorized PBX maintenance 
providers with no relationship to Avaya were legitimate because poor-quality servicing of Avaya PBX's could damage the Avaya 
brand; and that TLI was the party with questionable practices given its choice to pursue Avaya maintenance customers without 
authorization rather than ""play"" by the ""rules,"" id. at 15767. "
274,6," In doing so, it fails to mention that these two examples are drawn exclusively from Avaya's reply brief—the first time Avaya 
mentioned them in this [**160]  appeal. Compare Majority Op. 75, with Avaya Reply Br. 19."
274,7," Avaya's primary attack on the FUD issue is that the jury instructions misstated the law by failing to inform the jury of ""a 
presumption"" assigning de minimis competitive effect to false statements that antitrust plaintiffs ""must overcome"" by meeting a 
six-factor test if they are to show a FUD practice to be anticompetitive. Avaya Br. 64 (citing American Prof'l Testing Serv. v. 
Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Legal & Prof'l Publ'ns, 108 F.3d 1147, 1152 (9th Cir. 1997)). Because our Court is not among those 
that have adopted this presumption and six requirements, see, e.g., Maurice E. Stucke, How Do (and Should) Competition "
275,," Authorities Treat A Dominant Firm's Deception?, 63 SMU L. Rev. 1069, 1086 (2010), I would hold that the instructions were fine. 
I would also conclude that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find the FUD letters anticompetitive, especially given that 
such a finding has stronger foundation ""when . . . combined with other anticompetitive acts"" by Avaya. W. Penn Allegheny 
Health Sys., Inc. v. UPMC, 627 F.3d 85, 109 n.14 (3d Cir. 2010). To the extent [**163]  that sufficient evidence also needed to support TLI's other theory of liability (anticompetitive refusal to 
deal) given that the general verdict form does not indicate which of Avaya's allegedly anticompetitive acts formed the basis for 
the verdict, I would hold—with some reservation—that it does. The District Court's instructions were consistent with the Supreme 
Court's precedents setting forth the ""limited circumstances in which a firm's unilateral refusal to deal with its rivals can give rise 
to antitrust liability,"" Pac. Bell Tel. Co. v. Linkline Commc'ns, Inc., 555 U.S. 438, 448, 129 S. Ct. 1109, 172 L. Ed. 2d 836 (2009), 
and my review of the record leads me to conclude that TLI provided that ""minimum quantum of evidence from which a jury might 
reasonably afford relief."" Starceski v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., 54 F.3d 1089, 1095 (3d Cir. 1995) (quoting Rotondo v. Keene 
Corp., 956 F.2d 436, 438 (3d Cir. 1992)). "
283,1," Plaintiffs rely heavily on In re Vitamin C Antitrust Litigation, 904 F. Supp. 2d 310 (E.D.N.Y. 2012), for similar reasoning. In that 
case, ""[b]oth parties agree[d] that the vitamin C at issue was bought overseas by foreign purchasers and shipped into the United 
States."" Id. at 316-17. The trial court held that the ""relevant inquiry is whether the defendants' alleged anticompetitive behavior 
'was directed at an import market,'"" and concluded that it was because the complaint alleged conspiracy meetings and 
conversations ""in which the price, volume of sales and exports to the United States, and markets for vitamins were discussed "
284,," and agreed upon."" Id. But the Second Circuit recently vacated the judgment in the case and remanded it for dismissal after 
concluding that the trial court should have declined jurisdiction under principles of international comity. In re Vitamin C Antitrust 
Litig., No. 13-4791-cv, 837 F.3d 175, 2016 U.S. App. LEXIS 17135, 2016 WL 5017312 (2d Cir. Sept. 20, 2016)."
284,2," Interestingly, the circuit also approved a jury instruction in Hsiung which included the element that ""the members of the 
conspiracy engaged in one or both of the following activities: (A) fixing the price of TFT-LCD panels targeted by the participants 
to be sold in the United States or for delivery to the United States . . . ."" 778 F.3d at 748 (emphasis added). "
298,1," The following facts are taken primarily from the parties' Local Rule 56.1 statements—i.e., Defendant's Statement of Material 
Facts as to Which There is No Genuine Issue to Be Tried (""Carfax 56.1""), Plaintiffs' Rule 56.1 Response to Defendant's 
Statement of Material Facts as to Which There is No Genuine Issue to Be Tried (""Pls. 56.1 Resp.""), and Defendant's Reply to 
Plaintiffs' Rule 56.1 Response to Defendant's Rule 56.1 Statement of Facts (""Carfax 56.1 Reply""). The Court accepts as true any 
properly supported statement where the opposing party has either admitted the facts described in the statement or has failed to 
rebut those facts with citations to admissible evidence. See Giannullo v. City of New York, 322 F.3d 139, 140 (2d Cir. 2003). 
Where appropriate, the Court also relies on the evidence submitted to the Court for this motion. The Court declines Plaintiff's 
invitation to strike Carfax's 56.1 Reply, see Dkt. No. 164, particularly in light of the fact that both parties' responses to the other's 
56.1 statements have ignored Rule 56.1's admonition to be ""plain and concise."" "
299,2," As Plaintiffs note, the statute of limitations allows Plaintiffs to seek damages dating back to April 23, 2009. See 15 U.S.C. § 
15b; see also Opp. Br. 1 n.1. Because some of the agreements at issue here were in place before 2009, and carried into the 
limitations period, it is appropriate to consider their effects in the context of this partial summary judgment motion. Cf. Berkey 
Photo, Inc. v. Eastman Kodak Co., 603 F.2d 263, 296 (2d Cir. 1979) (""[A] purchaser suing a monopolist for overcharges paid 
within the previous four years may satisfy the conduct prerequisite to recovery by pointing to anticompetitive actions taken 
before the limitations period.""). "
300,3," The parties' stipulation in advance of this partial summary judgment practice contemplated that both parties' experts would 
submit two reports and that all the briefs would be ""a part of the record for summary judgment purposes."" Dkt. No. 151 at 5. 
Accordingly, the Court rejects Plaintiffs' suggestion that it should strike the reply report of Carfax's expert for relying on new 
arguments and data. See Dkt. No. 164. The arguments and data to which Plaintiffs object were produced to address the 
methodologies and conclusions of Plaintiffs' expert. Similarly, the Court rejects Carfax's suggestion that the Court should not 
consider Plaintiffs' rebuttal report, see Dkt. No. 163, given that Carfax's expert did introduce new data in his reply report, which 
makes the rebuttal report contemplated in the parties' stipulation all the more appropriate. "
302,4," To be sure, Carfax makes a brief argument as to one pro-competitive benefit of its CPO Agreements, see Carfax Br. 21, but it 
declines to respond to Plaintiffs' claim that any pro-competitive justification is ""beyond the scope of this Motion."" Opp. Br. 33. "
304,5," And of those ten, at least four were terminable within less than a year after the first year of the agreement. See Pls. 56.1 Resp. 
¶¶ 23-23.1, 26-27.1, 29-29.1. "
305,6," As will also be discussed infra at III(C)(2), the Court accepts, for purposes of this motion, that the remaining agreements with 
ten manufacturers were of sufficient duration to potentially foreclose competition. A reasonable jury could therefore rely on those 
CPO Agreements—but not the short-term CPO Agreements—in assessing how much of the VHR market was foreclosed."
305,7," There was one narrow exception to this requirement. If a dealer participated in a CPO program where it was required to use a 
VHR provider other than Carfax, then the dealer could list cars from that CPO program on Autotrader or Cars.com with a link to 
a non-Carfax VHR. See Koenig Decl. ¶¶ 66, 72. There is no genuine dispute that these agreements affected a small share of the "
306,," market for VHRs purchased through CPO programs, see Carfax 56.1 Reply ¶¶ 71-71.1, and therefore an even smaller share of 
the market for VHRs for cars that were listed on Autotrader or Cars.com. "
308,8," The one Second Circuit case that Plaintiffs cite on this point, Giannullo v. City of New York, is not to the contrary. In Giannullo, 
the district court had granted summary judgment to the defendants on plaintiff's claim that he was arrested without probable 
cause. See 322 F.3d 139, 140 (2d Cir. 2003). The Second Circuit reversed on the grounds that the ""record [did] not support the 
district court's determination that defendants were entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law, either on the basis of 
probable cause or qualified immunity."" Id. at 143. Both of those defenses, however, required the defendants to point to 
affirmative evidence in the record. It is therefore irrelevant that the Giannullo court emphasized that ""summary judgment must be 
denied"" where ""the movant fails to fulfill its initial burden"" because the defendants had an initial burden of identifying evidence in 
the record in that case. Id. at 140-41 (internal quotation marks omitted). "
309,9," Moreover, and as explained infra, even reaching the 30% foreclosure threshold would not necessarily be sufficient for Plaintiffs 
to defeat Carfax's partial summary judgment motion. "
310,10," To the extent Plaintiffs would argue that their stipulation to Carfax's market share (90%) turns out to be inconsistent with the 
market share that would result from stipulating that NMVTIS reports count as VHRs, the Court notes that that is one of the 
dangers of making stipulations before all of the facts have been uncovered in discovery. In any event, the Court's holding does 
not hinge on Dr. Singer's failure to include the NMVTIS reports, given the other reasons his analysis was flawed. "
311,11," This conclusion is not altered by two kinds of data that Dr. Singer apparently omitted. First, Plaintiffs note that Dr. Singer's 
foreclosure share estimate does not include data for CPO Agreements from 2008 to 2011. Opp. Br. 12; see also Singer Rep. ¶ 
67. Second, Plaintiffs explain that the estimate does not include an assessment of exclusive agreements that Carfax had with 
other classified websites, such as AOL, Vehix, and Yahoo Autos. Opp. Br. 12; see also Singer Rep. ¶ 42; Carfax 56.1 Reply ¶¶ 
88-88.1 & n.445. Both corrections would result in a more Plaintiff-friendly estimate of the share of the VHR market that was 
foreclosed. Opp. Br. 12. But Plaintiffs point to no evidence that these corrections would make anything more than a marginal 
difference in Dr. Singer's foreclosure estimate. Even if they had, such evidence could not rehabilitate Dr. Singer's findings in light 
of the foregoing discussion. "
312,12," In supplemental briefing requested by the Court after the Second Circuit decided MacDermid Printing Solutions LLC v. Cortron 
Corp., 833 F.3d 172, 2016 WL 4204795 (2d Cir. Aug. 10, 2016), Plaintiffs appear to raise the prospect that even if they cannot 
prove substantial foreclosure, they can continue to press their Section 1 claim if they present evidence of harm to consumers. 
Pls. Supp. Br. 2. This is incorrect as a matter of antitrust law and an apparent attempt to walk back the pledge that led the 
Court to permit a motion for partial summary judgment in the first place. With respect to the law, direct evidence of harm to 
competition is generally sufficient in Section 1 cases, but it is not sufficient in exclusive dealing cases. That is because 
""[e]xclusive dealing is an unreasonable restraint of trade and a § 1 violation only when the agreement freezes out a significant 
fraction of buyers or sellers from the market."" Geneva Pharms., 386 F.3d at 508 (emphasis added). If the rule were otherwise, it 
would vitiate the presumption that exclusive deals, which are hallmarks of many competitive industries, are legal and pro-
competitive. See CDC Techs., 186 F.3d at 80. Accordingly, a showing of substantial foreclosure is necessary. That was clearly 
the parties' understanding when they stipulated that a motion for partial summary judgment—on the specific issue of 
foreclosure—would resolve the case if the Court granted Carfax's motion. See Dkt. No. 151. To the extent Plaintiffs suggest an 
argument otherwise in their supplemental briefing, that argument is waived by virtue of their express representations to this 
Court. "
314,1," The parties in this case are the parent companies that own the hospitals. See Dkt. To simplify, the Court refers to the hospitals 
and their corporate management interchangeably, unless there is a relevant distinction, in which case the Court will note it. "
315,2," The parties have also filed motions to file their briefing under seal. ECF Nos. 151, 164, 165, 174. Those motions are granted 
except to the extent the Court relies on factual background in resolving the motion for summary judgment. See infra Section II for 
further discussion. Further, Methodist has filed a motion to clarify the record following St. Francis' reply. ECF No. 172. The Court 
has reviewed that motion and it is GRANTED, although the Court has focused its analysis on the parties' summary judgment 
briefing."
315,3," In 2013, 30 percent of St. Francis' discharges were covered by commercial insurance as opposed to 62 percent by government 
insurance. In that year, 28 percent of Methodist's discharges were commercially insured and 66 percent were governmentally 
insured. Also in 2013, St. Francis' received 47 percent of its payments from private payers and 52 percent from public payers. 
Methodist's numbers were 40 percent and 60 percent. "
316,4," All agree that the relevant geographic area in this case includes the counties of Peoria, Tazewell, and Woodford. The parties 
refer to this region as the ""tri-county area."""
316,5, Methodist and Proctor are now both owned by UnityPoint Health. 
317,6," St. Francis has recently been added to the BCBS HMO network, but was not for much of the time relevant to this case."
317,7," While Capps' report only accounts for admissions at St. Francis and Methodist, the Court treats the figures as an adequate 
proxy for the entire geographic market. "
318,8," St. Francis contends that evidence related to foreclosure of Caterpillar employees may not be considered because, essentially, 
no Caterpillar ""claim"" was pled. As the Court reads the complaint, the antitrust claims in this case arise out of St. Francis' 
allegedly unlawful conduct, and its dealing with Caterpillar is evidence of that conduct, not a separate claim that must have been 
pled. In any event, the course and scope of discovery should have alerted St. Francis to the fact that St. Francis had previously 
formed exclusive contracts with Caterpillar, and therefore it cannot claim to be surprised that those contracts are at issue in this 
case. See Schmidt v. Eagle Waste & Recycling, Inc., 599 F.3d 626, 632 (7th Cir. 2010)."
318,9," There is some dispute between the parties about whether the 38 percent tertiary services price increase combined with the 
general smaller price increase actually shows an open network premium. All the evidence in the record shows that such a 
premium exists, generally. It is therefore Methodist's burden to show that prices went down when the network opened up to 
competition. The parties have not clearly shown, either way, whether the two-tiered pricing increase represents an overall "
319,," increase or decrease to Caterpillar. (The evidence Methodist relies on shows a Caterpillar employee's forecast for a change in 
""total spend"" from between an increase in four percent and a decrease in two percent. It is not clear why Methodist has not 
provided a comparison between OSF exclusive Caterpillar spending and open-network Caterpillar spending.) See Resp. Ex. 
156, ECF No. 159-11."
319,10," The match program applied to the Blue Cross Blue Shield PPO—by far the largest and most important source of commercial 
payments in the market. "
321,11," Of course, as noted above, section 2 claims also require a plaintiff to prove that the defendant possesses monopoly power or 
substantial market power. St. Francis has conceded for purposes of this motion that [*25]  it possesses market power. "
322,12," The concept measures the increase in demand for a substitute good Y if the price of X is increased by some marginal amount. 
See Brown Shoe, 370 U.S. at 325. "
323,13, The parties agree that the relevant geographic market comprises the 6 hospitals in the tri-county area. 
325,14," If the Court did not count OSF employees in the overall product market, it would also have to eliminate Methodist employees 
because Methodist also is the exclusive provider for its employees' health plan. Both OSF and Methodist are major Peoria 
employers, and although OSF is larger, the difference is not material in this case. "
326,15," The figure is probably close to 15 percent, which represents Capps' estimate minus patients treated at Methodist minus BCBS 
PPO ASO patients minus Caterpillar patients minus OSF employees."
326,16," This represents Capps' estimate minus the patients Methodist actually treated minus BCBS PPO ASO patients minus OSF 
employees. "
327,17," The exclusivity provision for Humana is slightly different, but not materially so. "
328,18," The Court need not address Capps' cramped and internally inconsistent definition of outpatient surgical services, which 
excludes, for example, any endoscopy or colonoscopy or any non-invasive diagnostic imaging. Methodist owns 49 percent of the 
Central Illinois Endoscopy Center, [*47]  and Capps' narrower definition of outpatient surgery therefore excludes the CIEC from 
foreclosure calculation. In other words, had Capps stuck to his original definition of outpatient surgery, the evidence would show 
far less foreclosure because the BCBS PPO contract did not prevent BCBS from including the CIEC in any of its provider 
network. "
330,19," The parties have submitted detailed briefing regarding the documents they have requested to remain under seal, complete 
with affidavits from non-party counsel providing analysis of each document requested to be sealed. See e.g. Pl.'s Am. Mot. For 
Leave to File Under Seal, Exs. AS, BK, BL, BN, ECF Nos. 164-47,65, 66, 68. The parties have complied with the expectations 
set out in Baxter that parties who move to seal documents should ""analyze in detail, document by document, [*55]  the propriety 
of secrecy, providing reasons and legal citations."" Baxter Int'l, 297 F.3d at 548. "
331,20," These documents are attached as Exhibits to this Order and will be identified as Court's Partially Unsealed Def.'s Mem. Supp.

331,21," The document shall be identified as Court's Partially Unsealed Capps Report, Ex. 3. "
343,1," For purposes of this motion, OSF accepts as true the portions of the allegations of the Complaint that support this Statement of 
Undisputed Facts. Nothing in this Statement of Undisputed Facts, however, shall be deemed to modify OSF's Answer to the 
Complaint. "
344,2," For purposes of this motion, OSF refers to certain statements made in the Capps Report, however, OSF does not waive its 
right to contest the Capps Report's assertions and arguments, including its characterization of the facts. "

353,4, [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] 
360,5," While UPM argues that United and the BCBS HMO were not truly ""exclusive"" because the contracts did not expressly exclude 
OSF's participation, this is a distinction without a difference. Regardless of the terms of the contract, the fact is that UPM 
negotiated rates on the basis that it was an in-network provider for these payers, and OSF was not. "
361,6," Consistent with the remainder of the record, UPM's table of ""Large Payers"" at the time did not include Aetna."
361,7," Of course, this list ignores [*118]  entirely the many other means UPM had to attract employers and patients, including but not 
limited to a major limitation to the scope of the OSF/BCBS PPO semi-exclusive agreement, which is discussed in Section 
III.B.4.d. "
362,8," This is even more compelling when one considers the fact that the SFMC BCBS PPO agreement did not restrict, in any manner 
whatsoever, access to UPM's outpatient facilities. See Sec. III.B.5, infra. "
365,9," The Caterpillar PPO contract does not form the basis of any claim in UPM's Complaint. UPM is not entitled to amend its 
Complaint via the Capps Report. See Sec. III.B.4.g, infra."
365,10," 13.6% results from adding the values for Humana (6.6%) and [*130]  OSF Health Plan (7.0%) which Humana purchased the 
previous year. "
366,11," The row in the relevant tables in the Willig Report titled ""Patients that Actually Went to Methodist"" includes BCBS PPO ASO 
members. To avoid double-counting in adding the adjustment for patients actually seen to the BCBS PPO ASO adjustment, 
subtract lines 1 and 2 from ""Three Corrections Combined."" The ""Three Corrections Combined"" line eliminates the potential for 
double-counting in summing the impact of three adjustments together."
366,12," Again, the network composition rate clauses in the OSF/BCBS PPO clauses guaranteed rates, and only prohibited BCBS from 
adding UPM to the PPO network without renegotiating its rates with OSF. "
367,13," Again, the rates OSF offered to BCBS for SFMC reflect the anticipated volume SFMC would receive as one of two Peoria in-
network hospitals in the region. Accordingly, [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] "
368,14, HAMP is not part of the 2009 foreclosure figure. 
369,15," Notably, UPM seeks damages from its exclusion from the Caterpillar PPO network in 2009 -- the same year in which 
Caterpillar was offering an HMO product that was exclusive to UPM. Caterpillar then provided its employees with a choice 
between the UPM HMO and the OSF PPO, and UPM and OSF competed to have the employees choose their respective plan. 
Again, this case seeks to negate that prior competition through its claim that UPM was entitled to be in-network for every 
Caterpillar (and every other commercial insurer's) health plan."
369,16," The $2.25 million claim consists of approximately $1.8 million in [*142]  claimed damages for inpatient hospital services and 
approximately $450,000 in claimed damages for outpatient surgical services."
369,17," Caterpillar is not listed in the 2012 foreclosure table because UPM has been an in-network provider in the Caterpillar PPO 
since July 2010. [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] "

defeat any claimed consumer savings, but he did not calculate this number. Exh. 84 (Capps Dep. 49:13-50:4). "
375,22," Capps also pointed to the fact that OSF did not impose a price increase on Aetna when it agreed to open the network in 2014. 
Exh. 84 (Capps Dep. at 40:17-41:7). But Aetna was a miniscule player whose prices were already significantly above its 
competitors, reflecting Aetna's weak bargaining position as a marginal health insurer in Peoria. SMF ¶ 224. "
393,1," More than 50 of SFMC's undisputed facts are not supported by their citations. However, to advance this litigation, Methodist 
has not disputed certain of these facts. The following admitted material facts are not supported by SFMC's citations: 43, 45, 48, 
55, 66, 98, 99, 111, 112, 120, 122, 136, 148, 176, 177, 178, 181, 205 and 218. "
435,2," A violation of Section 1 consists of three elements: (1) the existence of a contract, combination, or conspiracy among two or 
more separate entities that (2) unreasonably restrains trade and (3) affects interstate or foreign commerce. See Standard Oil Co. 
v. United States, 221 U.S. 1, 58, 31 S. Ct. 502, 55 L. Ed. 619 (1911)."
435,3," A monopolization claim consists of two elements: (1) the possession of monopoly power in the relevant market, and (2) the 
willful acquisition or maintenance of that power. United States v. Grinnell Corp., 384 U.S. 563, 570-71, 86 S. Ct. 1698, 16 L. Ed. 
2d 778 (1966). An attempted monopolization claim consists of three elements: (1) specific intent to control prices or destroy 
competition, (2) predatory or anticompetitive conduct, and (3) a dangerous probability of success. Spectrum Sports v. McQuillan, 
506 U.S. 447, 456, 113 S. Ct. 884, 122 L. Ed. 2d 247 (1993). "

2 of the Sherman Act, even though the district court found no liability under Section 1). "
437,6," SFMC does not contest the existence of: (1) a contract or agreement; (2) substantial market power; (3) specific intent to control 
prices or destroy competition; (4) dangerous probability [*305]  of success; and (5) a relevant geographic market. SFMC's failure 
to raise these issues precludes them from being a basis for summary judgment. See Cloe v. City of Indianapolis, 712 F.3d 1171, 
1182 (7th Cir. 2013) (""As a general matter, if the moving party does not raise an issue in support of its motion for summary

438,8," See ABA SECTION OF ANTITRUST LAW, ANTITRUST LAW DEVELOPMENTS, at 215 (7th ed. 2012) (""Since Tampa Electric, courts have 
steadily moved away from a strict focus on foreclosure percentage to a more nuanced analysis of whether the arrangement 
threatens to create or enhance market power and therefore lead to an anticompetitive outcome.""); Jonathan M. Jacobson, 
Exclusive Dealing, ""Foreclosure,"" and Consumer Harm, 70 ANTITRUST L.J. 311, 313 (2002) (""By increasing the focus on market 
power, rather than the degree of foreclosure, the more recent cases had done much to harmonize exclusive dealing analysis 
with more general analysis of restraint of trade under [*308]  the rule of reason."")."
438,9," For purposes of its foreclosure argument, SFMC concedes that Methodist has properly defined the relevant market. (Mem. at 
48-49.) SFMC also does not contest whether it possessed substantial market power in the relevant markets. "
439,10," SFMC cites to discussion of a single email from 2009 as evidence that BCBS's requests for an open network were only a 
negotiating strategy to get lower prices from SFMC. (SFMC Statement of Undisputed Facts (""SFF"") ¶ 157.) As set out above, 
SFMC's fact is disputed and BCBS's preferred contracting strategy was to have open networks. Further, the overwhelming 
amount of record evidence shows that BCBS preferred including Methodist as an in-network provider over obtaining lower prices 
from SFMC. (MF ¶¶ 110, 115-17, 121, 123, 135-37, 146.) "
442,11, A more detailed discussion regarding SFMC's higher prices is set forth below in Section III.B.2.
442,12," See, e.g., ProMedica Health Sys., Inc. v. F.T.C., 749 F. 3d 559, 562 (6th Cir. 2014) (""If a provider becomes so dominant in a 
particular market that no MCO can walk away from it and remain competitive, however, then that provider can demand—and 
more to the point receive—monopoly rates (i.e., prices significantly higher than what the MCOs would pay in a competitive 
market)."")."
442,13," Similarly, the chart from a Methodist presentation to Moody's that SFMC also relies on does not present a full picture of the 
foreclosure of the market because it does not account for the relative size of the payors. "
443,14," Regardless of contract rights, as a practical matter employers cannot switch [*326]  frequently or readily because of concerns 
about disruption to their employees. Dr. Capps described disruption as ""taking what [patients] are currently doing with their 
healthcare and saying you have to do something different now, whether it's changing their doctor or otherwise."" (MF ¶ 13.) "
444,15," SFMC does not contest the existence of entry barriers in the relevant market, which include, among other things: (a) 
substantial capital costs; and (b) the Certificate of Need process required by the Illinois' Health Facilities and Services Review 
Board for any application to build or expand a hospital. (Ex. 233 at ¶¶ 396-402.) "
445,16," SFMC and Methodist are responsible for an overwhelming majority of admissions of all Tri-County hospitals. In 2013 
Methodist and SFMC accounted for 82% of all inpatient admissions and 83% of all inpatient days of the six hospitals in the Tri-
County Area. (Ex. 233 at Fig. 15.) The percentage of admissions attributable to the insurers from whom Methodist is foreclosed 
would have to vary immensely at the other four hospitals to have any significant effect on the overall level of foreclosure."
445,17," If the foreclosed portion of SFMC and Methodist's business is 52% and they represent 82% of all admissions of the six Tri-
County hospitals (according to 2013 data), the foreclosed portion of all hospitals business (under the patently untrue assumption 
that no BCBS PPO, Humana, HAMP, or Aetna patients go to the other four hospitals) is 52% multiplied by 82%, or 
approximately 43%. "
446,18," Methodist does not claim any entitlement to damages for such patients, except to the extent that a hypothetical in-network 
payment would have varied from the out-of-network payment that Methodist received. (Ex. 233 at ¶¶ 519-20, 542.)"
446,19," Even if SFMC is correct that patients who were treated at Methodist on an out-of-network basis should not [*336]  be included 
in the foreclosure percentage, SFMC's expert has not properly calculated the percent of total payments affected. (Ex. 234 at ¶ 
357 n. 327.) Professor Willig incorrectly calculated this number based on BCBS charges and not BCBS payments. (Id.) 
Accounting for this error, the appropriate percentage is 2.5%. Therefore, even if SFMC were correct, the effect on the 
foreclosure percentage calculated by Methodist is not material."
446,20," As with out-of-network patients treated at Methodist, Methodist is not claiming any damages related to patients covered by 
BCBS ASO contracts who were in fact treated at Methodist. (Ex. 234 ¶ 232.) "
447,21," Again, Methodist does not claim any damages with relation to SFMC employees, but only that they comprise a part of the 
market from which it is foreclosed. (Ex. 234 at ¶ 357.) "
450,22," SFMC misstates the record when it insists that it never imposed exclusivity with regard to outpatient facilities. [TEXT 
REDACTED BY THE COURT] (MF ¶ 186.)"
450,23," Neither SFMC nor its experts have challenged this definition of the outpatient surgery market. Therefore the procedures 
performed at CIE are not within the outpatient surgery market and Methodist cannot use its involvement in CIE to compete in 
that market."
450,24," In addition, SFMC's motion does not challenge Methodist's standing to assert the antitrust claims at issue. As a result, 
Methodist is not required to present evidence to establish that point. Cloe, 712 F.3d at 1182. Even so, Methodist clearly has 
antitrust standing. See Appleton Papers, 35 F. Supp. 2d at 1147 (""Courts have consistently held that competitors frozen out by 
exclusive dealing arrangements have suffered an antitrust injury and possess antitrust standing to sue for redress of this 
injury.""). "
451,25," ""Suppose an established manufacturer has long held a dominant position but is starting to lose market share to an aggressive 
young rival. A set of strategically planned exclusive-dealing contracts may slow the rival's expansion by requiring it to develop 
alternative outlets for its product, or rely at least temporarily on inferior or more expensive outlets. Consumer injury results from 
the delay that the dominant firm imposes on the smaller rival's growth."" Philip Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp. ANTITRUST LAW ¶

460,705, Id.
460,706," Deposition of Calvin MacKay, Feb. 11, 2015, 66. "
462,1," Plaintiffs are Planned Parenthood Federation Of America, Inc. (PPFA), Planned Parenthood: Shasta-Diablo, Inc., Dba Planned 
Parenthood Northern California (Planned Parenthood Northern California or PPNC), Planned Parenthood Mar Monte, Inc. 
(PPMM), Planned Parenthood of the [**5]  Pacific Southwest (PPPSW), Planned Parenthood Los Angeles (PPLA), Planned 
Parenthood/Orange and San Bernardino Counties, Inc. (PPOSBC), Planned Parenthood Of Santa Barbara, Ventura & San Luis 
Obispo Counties, Inc. (PPSBVSLO), Planned Parenthood Pasadena and San Gabriel Valley, Inc. (PPPSGV), Planned 
Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains (PPRM), Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast (PPGC) and Planned Parenthood Center For 
Choice (PPCFC). Defendants are the Center for Medical Progress (CMP), BioMax Procurement Services LLC (BioMax), David 
Daleiden (aka ""Robert Sarkis"") (Daleiden), Troy Newman (Newman), Albin Rhomberg (Rhomberg), Phillip S. Cronin (Cronin), 
Sandra Susan Merritt (aka ""Susan Tennenbaum"") (Merritt), and Gerardo Adrian Lopez (Lopez)."
462,2," Defendant Sandra Merritt moved separately and filed her own motion to dismiss and motion to strike. Dkt. Nos. 78, 81. The 
other defendants joined in filing one motion to dismiss and one motion to strike. Dkt. Nos. 79, 87. "
463,3," Plaintiffs also allege that defendants set up and incorporated [**7]  CMP as a non-profit under California law, and falsely 
represented that CMP would be nonpartisan and not engage in any legislative advocacy. Id. ¶ 59."
463,4," The meetings allegedly accessed by defendants are: the 2014 NAF Conference in San Francisco, California (FAC ¶¶ 64-74); 
the PPFA North American Forum on Family Planning in Miami, FL in October 2014 (id. ¶¶ 81-89); the PPFA Medical Directors' 
Council Conference in Orlando, Florida in February-March 2015 (id. ¶¶ 98-103); the PPFA National Conference in Washington, 
DC in March 2015 (id. ¶¶ 105-108); and the NAF 2015 Conference in Baltimore, Maryland (id. ¶¶ 118-123)."
463,5," The senior medical staff who met with defendants include Dr. Deborah Nucatola in California (FAC ¶¶ 75-76) and Dr. Mary 
Gatter in California (id. ¶¶ 95-97). "
465,6," Defendants' Scheidler argument, if accepted, would likewise limit the reach of Planned Parenthood v. Am. Coal. of Life 
Activists, 945 F. Supp. 1355, 1382 (D. Or. 1996) (following Scheidler). "
466,7," I recognize that the Ninth Circuit rejected plaintiffs' arguments that standing requirements should be relaxed for health care 
providers, and in doing so described Scheidler in a footnote as a case concerning ""constitutional standing, not RICO or antitrust 
standing."" Id. at 704 n.4. But the Ninth Circuit did not address or otherwise limit the Supreme Court's determination that plaintiffs 
in Scheidler had adequately alleged injury to ""business or property"" under the RICO statute."
466,8," Defendants' reliance on Rylewicz v. Beaton Services, Ltd., 698 F. Supp. 1391, 1395 (N.D. Ill. 1988) does not help them either. 
There, the court concluded that ""effort and time"" the plaintiffs spent on an investigation into defendants' alleged campaign to 
intimidate them were ""personal injuries or political damages"" not damages to ""business or property"" as required by § 1964(c). 
Here the damages are to PFFA and its affiliates as businesses. "
467,9," California, Colorado, Maryland, and Texas."
467,10," Plaintiffs rely also on United States v. Mahaffy, 693 F.3d 113, 135 (2d Cir. 2012) a securities fraud case which held, without 
analysis, that ""[i]formation may qualify as confidential under Carpenter even if it does not constitute a trade secret."" That may be 
correct as a matter of securities law or in a state that has not adopted UTSA, but that position [**22]  was explicitly rejected 
under California law in SunPower. "
468,11," 18 U.S.C. § 1028(a)(1)-(2) makes it unlawful to ""(1) knowingly and without lawful authority produces an identification 
document, authentication feature, or a false identification document"" and ""(2) knowingly transfers an identification document, 
authentication feature, or a false identification document knowing that such document or feature was stolen or produced without 
lawful authority."" § 1028(a)(7) makes it unlawful to ""knowingly transfers, possesses, or uses, without lawful authority, a means of 
identification of another [**24]  person with the intent to commit, or to aid or abet, or in connection with, any unlawful activity that 
constitutes a violation of Federal law, or that constitutes a felony under any applicable State or local law."""
468,12, Plaintiffs disclaim any reliance on (a)(3) in their Opposition at 10 n.7.
468,13," ""Production"" includes ""alter, authenticate, or assemble."" 18 U.S.C. § 1028(a)(9); see also United States v. Jaensch, 665 F.3d 
83, 95 (4th Cir. 2011) (""Because Jaensch's ID contained Jaensch's signature, jurors could reasonably infer that Jaensch both 
signed and laminated his ID after it was shipped to his home address—acts [**25]  of ""production"" under the statutory 
definition.""); but see United States v. Rashwan, 328 F.3d 160, 165 (4th Cir. 2003) (conviction upheld under § 1028(a)(1) where 
defendant did not produce but simply procured false identification in significant part under an aiding and abetting theory)."
468,14," See, e.g., United States v. Villarreal, 253 F.3d 831, 835 (5th Cir. 2001) (""with respect to [the] jurisdictional element, we do not 
focus on whether the identification document actually traveled in interstate or foreign commerce or whether the transfer actually "
469,," affected interstate or foreign commerce. Rather, we focus on whether the identification document would have traveled in 
interstate or foreign commerce or whether the transfer would have affected interstate or foreign commerce if Villarreal had 
successfully accomplished his intended goals."")."
469,15," The cases defendants rely on regarding use in commerce are post-trial cases reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence 
supporting those claims. See Defs. MTD at 9. "
471,16, There are no allegations that defendants were directly responsible for hacking plaintiffs' website.
471,17," Defendant Merritt raises a slightly different proximate cause argument, saying that the damages identified by plaintiffs are 
simply costs of engaging in their chosen business and were not incurred as the result of Merritt's attending the conferences and 
meetings alleged. Merritt MTD at 3-4. Those arguments are without merit as (i) plaintiffs pleaded they incurred additional security 
costs as a result of defendants' fraud; and (ii) plaintiffs need not [**34]  tie Merritt's specific actions to specific damages, but 
rather tie the predicate acts committed as part of the RICO enterprise to proximately caused damages. Relatedly, defendants' 
characterization of plaintiffs' decision to incur additional security costs as a ""voluntary"" act in light of defendants' infiltrations is 
not dispositive at this juncture. Whether plaintiffs' costs were necessarily incurred is a matter to be explored in discovery. "
472,18," Merritt argues in Reply that the alter ego allegations are facially deficient as well. Merritt MTD Reply at 6-7. Plaintiffs have 
adequately alleged that BioMax was set up as a fake company through the direct [**39]  participation of Merritt and that Merritt 
consistently held herself out as the CEO of BioMax and distributed BioMax advertising materials. See, e.g., FAC ¶¶ 5, 35, 41, 
61, 87. The alter ego cases discussed by Merritt (addressing the more common ownership, beneficial interest, and co-mingled 
fund allegations typically presented in alter ego cases) are inapposite considering the factual allegations in this case. Plaintiffs' 
very specific factual allegations are sufficient at this juncture to support plaintiffs' alter ego assertions. "
473,19," I recognize that the laws of the states of Colorado, Florida, District of Columbia, Maryland and Texas apply to the contacts at 
issue. See Oppo. at 15 n.11. Neither side contends that the specific law of any of these jurisdictions differs in any significant 
respect with respect to the analysis of the breach of contract claims. The California cases cited in this Order were relied on by 
the parties. "
475,20, The adequacy of the allegations regarding PPCG's damages is satisfied for the reasons discussed above.
475,21," For the reasons discussed above, plaintiffs have adequately [**50]  alleged damages proximately caused by the breach of the 
NAF agreements. "
476,22," Defendants complain that plaintiffs should be required to state more facts — as to the location of the conferences and the 
terms of the lease agreements — but those facts will come out in discovery and are not necessary at this juncture for defendants 
to be able to defend against the trespass claim. "
477,23," Defendants also argue — specifically with respect to Colorado and Texas — that the FAC itself establishes that consent was 
given to defendants to access the clinics in those states. Defs. MTD at 26. However, plaintiffs have adequately alleged plausible 
facts supporting their contentions that consent was impermissibly obtained by misrepresentation or exceeded by defendants. 
What plaintiffs can prove as to these arguments under the requirements of Colorado and Texas law is more appropriately 
addressed on summary judgment. "
478,24," Merritt argues that she cannot be liable for trespass at the PPFA meetings in Florida or the District of Columbia because she 
did not attend those [**57]  meetings. The PPFA trespass claim, however, is also based on Merritt's alleged trespass at the 
PPFA Texas and Colorado clinics Therefore the claim for trespass against Merritt will not be dismissed at this juncture."
478,25," Merritt contends that because her conversations at the conferences, clinics, and restaurants cannot be considered ""business 
practices,"" the UCL claim must fail. Merritt MTD at 12-13. However, the FAC adequately alleges that Men-itt's conduct was 
necessarily part of her efforts on behalf of BioMax (albeit a fake business) and intended to injure the business of plaintiffs and 
injure consumers. FAC ¶¶ 35, 61, 64, 68, 69, 80, 87, 88, 95, 109, 115. These allegations are sufficient to state a claim under the 
UCL at this juncture."
478,26," As the Lorzano Court noted, whether or not the Cel-Tech test is also applicable to consumer claims is an open issue in the 
California courts. Id. at 736. "
479,27," Defendants reliance on Frenzel v. AliphCom, 76 F. Supp. 3d 999, 1015 (N.D. Cal. 2014) is misplaced. There, the court 
concluded a claim for injunctive relief under the UCL based on misrepresentations about the functionalities and battery life of a 
fitness tracker could not be alleged because the plaintiff already [**62]  knew the falsity of those claims and could not plausibly 
allege he would be deceived by them in the future. Here, while plaintiffs may reasonably expect defendants to continue their 
attempts to infiltrate meetings and clinics, the individuals who might attempt to do so at defendants' direction or the exact 
methods to be used are not so obviously known as to render injunctive relief unnecessary."
479,28," Merritt also argues that plaintiffs fail to adequately allege detrimental reliance by plaintiffs on any of Merritt's specific 
misrepresentations. Merritt MTD at 16-18. However, plaintiffs specifically identify the misrepresentations by Merritt and BioMax "
480,," in their applications, agreements, advertising materials, and verbal statements and that plaintiffs relied on in giving Merritt and 
BioMax access. FAC ¶¶ 81, 84, 87-89, 98, 102, 105-106, 108, 109-110, 113-115. The fact that plaintiffs have not identified the 
employees of plaintiffs who received these misrepresentations, given the context of this case and the specificity as to the content 
and timing of the representations, does make the allegations deficient. "
481,29," In addition to attempting to distinguish Med. Lab. Mgmt. Consultants v. Am. Broad. Companies, Inc., 30 F. Supp. 2d 1182 (D. 
Ariz. 1998), aff d, 306 F.3d 806 (9th Cir. 2002), plaintiffs also rely on it, noting that the court denied summary judgment on the 
aspect of the fraud claim where plaintiff claimed emotional distress damages for the deception - the fraudulent access by 
plaintiffs to a meeting with defendant - separate from any emotional distress damages stemming from the publication. Id. at 
1200-1201."
481,30," See also Hornberger v. Am. Broad. Companies, Inc., 351 N.J. Super. 577, 630, 799 A.2d 566 (App. Div. 2002) (plaintiff police 
officers filmed conducting traffic stops of African-American males sued for the broadcast on Prime Time Live and sought 
emotional distress and reputational damages, the court concluded that ""plaintiffs are not entitled to these reputational and 
emotional distress damages, resulting from a publication, without showing that the publication contained a false statement of fact 
that was made with actual malice.""). "
483,31," Defendants' reliance on Turnbull v. Am. Broad. Companies, No. CV 03-3554 SJO(FMOX), 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 47528, 2005 
WL 6054964, at *6 (C.D. Cal. Mar. 7, 2005), does not help them on this motion [**75]  to dismiss. There, the court affirmed the 
jury verdict where plaintiffs conceded they ""were talking openly"" and were aware that others were in the room. Those 
circumstances supported the jury's conclusion that a reasonable person would have expected that the conversations may be 
overheard."
483,32," Defendants argue that the NAF NDA agreements are irrelevant to the question of a reasonable expectation of privacy in light 
of the Flanagan court's clarification that a violation of Section 632 turns more on expectations regarding ""simultaneous 
dissemination"" of conversations rather than ""secondhand repetition,"" which would be prohibited by the NDA. 27 Cal. 4th at 775. 
However, the NDAs are not irrelevant concerning whether there has been an ""intentional eavesdropping or recording"" prohibited 
by Section 632. Id. at 776. In Flanagan, the California Supreme Court adopted a standard that gave greater protection to 
privacy interests in private conversations. Id. Similarly, defendants' arguments that NAF's efforts to limit and screen participants 
at the meeting and that plaintiffs' characterizations of the contents of the recorded conversations as ""sensitive"" are irrelevant 
under Flanagan are also without merit. "
484,33," Defendants challenge the adequacy of the allegations regarding defendant Lopez, who is not named as attending the 2014 
NAF meeting or participating in the Nucatola or Gatter meetings. In Opposition, plaintiffs argue that Lopez is included with the 
""DALEIDEN and his co-conspirators"" allegations in paragraph 212 with respect to the 2014 NAF meeting. I conclude that at this 
juncture, prior to discovery, it is not appropriate to dismiss Lopez from the Section 632 claim. "
485,34," While defendants point to case law rejecting the idea that there can be a privacy interest in a conference call held to conduct 
the business of a company by participants acting on behalf of the company, Cohen Bros., LLC v. ME Corp., S.A., 872 So. 2d 
321, 325 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2004), that case does not support defendants' argument that there can be no privacy interest in 
""closed business meetings,"" even if the Florida conferences could be analogized to closed business meetings. See also 
Morningstar v. State, 428 So. 2d 220, 221 (Fla. 1982) (rejecting constitutional challenge to wiretapping statute as applied to 
""expectation of privacy in"" a ""private office""); Jatar v. Lamaletto, 758 So. 2d 1167, 1169 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2000), cause 
dismissed, 786 So. 2d 1186 (Fla. 2001) (rejecting right to privacy because ""[s]ociety is not prepared to recognize as reasonable 
an expectation of privacy"" in a conversation in someone else's business office seeking extortion)."
485,35," The cases defendants contend are factually analogous are not. Matter of John Doe Trader No. One, 894 F.2d 240, 245 (7th 
Cir. 1990) (""The environment of the trading floor, the presence of the [government] agent and other traders all indicate that a 
reasonable expectation of privacy did not exist.""); Med. Lab. Mgmt. Consultants v. Am. Broad. Companies, Inc., 306 F.3d 806, 
818 (9th Cir. 2002) (defendants covert videotaping of ""external"" semi-public workplace communications by ""strangers"" who could 
have been potential partners or competitors could not support objectively reasonable expectation of privacy); Kemp v. Block, 607 
F. Supp. 1262, 1264 (D. Nev. 1985) (no reasonable expectation [**83]  of privacy where argument conducted in ""loud voices,"" 
defendant and the other coworkers who overheard the argument were in a place they had a right to be (therefore plaintiff may be 
deemed to have knowingly exposed the discussion to them), relatively small size of the instrument shop and its lack of interior "
486,," walls further indicated that an expectation of privacy within it would not be objectively reasonable, and plaintiff had no right to 
exclude other persons from entering the shop while the argument ensued)."
486,36," Merritt argues the wiretapping claim under Florida law should be dismissed as to her because she did not attend the Florida 
meetings. Merritt MTD at 20. Plaintiffs, again, rely on their alter ego allegations. That claim will not be dismissed as to Merritt at 
this juncture."
486,37," To establish associational standing, a plaintiff must demonstrate: ""(a) its members would otherwise have standing to sue in 
their own right; (b) the interests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization's purpose; and (c) neither the claim asserted 
nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in [**86]  the lawsuit."" Associated Gen. Contractors of 
Am. v. Metro. Water Dist. of S. Cal., 159 F.3d 1178, 1181 (9th Cir.1998) (citation omitted). "
488,38," This evidence is relevant only to the determination of the anti-SLAPP motions and irrelevant to the determination of the 
motions to dismiss. In ruling on an anti-SLAPP motion, the court considers, ""the pleadings, and supporting and opposing 
affidavits stating the facts upon which the liability or defense is based."" Mindys Cosmetics, Inc. v. Dakar, 611 F.3d 590, 598 (9th 
Cir. 2010) (quoting Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 425.16(b)(2)). "
489,39," Plaintiffs rely on Merritt's deposition testimony in StemExpress, LLC, et al v. The Center For Medical Progress, et al, Case No. 
BC 589145, pending in Los Angeles County Superior Court, in which Merritt admits she has never published any articles. 
Declaration of Amy L. Bomse (Dkt. No. 94), Ex. A, Depo. Trans. of Sandra Susan Merritt at 27:20-21. A full copy of that 
deposition transcript is filed in support of Merritt's reply on her motion to strike. Dkt. No. 102."
489,40," I grant the request for Judicial Notice, but only as to the existence of [**97]  this opinion and pleadings, and not for purposes of 
noticing the truth of the facts or arguments made therein. See, e.g., Lee v. City of Los Angeles, 250 F.3d 668, 689-90 (9th Cir. 
2001). "
491,41," In their Reply, defendants refer to ""evidence"" regarding the PPCG meeting and cite to a specific portion of a video. Defs. MTS 
Reply at 9. Daleiden's declaration provided a link to the whole video, but the specific contents of that video were not discussed in "
492,," it or in defendants' moving papers. If I were to consider this ""evidence"" and the argument improperly raised for the first time in 
Reply, it would not result in my granting the motion to strike the breach of contract [**104]  claim with respect to the PPCG 
meeting. It would only support an argument that some portion of the taping or subsequent disclosure may not have breached the 
PPCG contract, an issue appropriate for resolution on summary judgment or trial. The second piece of evidence discussed, 
again for the first time in Reply, is the video of the Dr. Nucatola lunch that defendants contend shows that Dr. Nucatola ""clearly 
viewed"" the lunch as an opportunity to provide information to defendants and not a business meeting on behalf of PPFA. Defs. 
MTS Reply at 13 & n2. Again, if I were to consider that evidence, it at most raises a question of fact that cannot be resolved on a 
motion to strike under the anti-SLAPP statute. "
493,42," This is not an ""uncontroverted"" record, unlike in the case relied on by Merritt. People v. Parra, 165 Cal. App. 3d 874, 879, 212 
Cal. Rptr. 53 (Cal. Ct. App. 1985) (affirming admission of evidence [**109]  because recording fell within § 633.5, where 
""recording was clearly for the purpose of obtaining evidence of appellant's intent to carry out her prior written threats of physical 
violence""). Where there is controverted evidence, the issue is for the jury. See Moore v. Telfon Commc'ns Corp., 589 F.2d 959, 
965 (9th Cir. 1978) (the ""jury alternatively found either that Moore impliedly consented, the communication was not confidential, 
or Anderson recorded the conversation for the purpose of obtaining evidence reasonably believed to relate to the crime of 
extortion.""). "
495,1," Indiana courts interpret Indiana's monopoly law in harmony with § 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act. See Berghausen v. Microsoft 
Corp., 765 N.E.2d 592, 594 (Ind. Ct. App. 2002) (""The Indiana Act was modeled after section two of the Sherman Antitrust Act, 
15 U.S.C. 2, . . . and has been interpreted consistent with the federal law interpreting the Federal Act.""). Thus, the federal 
authority used throughout this opinion apply equally to the state antitrust count, unless specified otherwise, and the resulting 
relief from this opinion will be applicable to both counts. "
499,2, The Indiana Code's use of this phrase includes ambulatory services. 
510,1," Named entities include Bank of Nova Scotia and its subsidiaries and affiliates, including ScotiaMocatta."
510,2," Named entities include Barclays Bank plc and its subsidiaries and affiliates, including Barclays Capital Inc."
510,3," Named entities include Deutsche Bank AG and its subsidiaries and affiliates, including Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. On April 
14, 2016, Plaintiffs notified the Court that they had reached a settlement with Deutsche Bank, although no motion for approval of 
a Settlement Class has yet been presented to the Court."
510,4," Named entities include HSBC Holdings plc and its subsidiaries and affiliates, including HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. and HSBC 
Bank USA."
510,5," Named entities include Société Générale SA and its subsidiaries and affiliates, including Newedge [**3]  USA, LLC."
510,6," Gold exchange-traded funds invest solely in gold bullion and issue shares that are directly linked to spot gold prices and that 
can be traded via exchange. Second Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint ¶¶ 102-03."
510,7," Unless otherwise noted, citations to the docket shall be to the MDL case docket for these consolidated actions, 14-md-2548."
510,8, The facts are taken from the Second Amended Complaint. 
511,9," ""Good Delivery"" gold refers to gold that meets certain quality standards and is used for settling transactions in the London 
Bullion Market. Id. ¶ 93."
511,10," Defendant Deutsche Bank was a LGMF member until May 2014 when it resigned its seat after trying, but failing, to sell the 
seat to another institution in the wake of an investigation by German regulators into potential manipulation in the precious metals 
markets. Id. ¶¶ 22, 279. "
513,11," Plaintiffs further allege that Defendants used manipulative trading tactics such as ""spoofing"" (sending false signals to the 
market by placing large orders that were never executed), ""wash sales"" (placing large orders that are executed and then quickly 
reversed) and ""front running"" of customer orders in order artificially to suppress the price of gold. SAC ¶ 8 n.2. In support of 
these allegations, however, Plaintiffs' rely exclusively on various regulatory investigations and findings, discussed further infra, 
regarding the manipulation of foreign exchange and precious metals markets, generally, and the independent action of Barclays 
with respect to a single instance of price manipulation. Id. ¶¶ 283-308."
513,12," See, e.g., In re Foreign Exch. Benchmark Rates Antitrust Litig., 74 F. Supp. 3d 581, 592 (S.D.N.Y. 2015); Laydon v. Mizuho 
Bank, Ltd., No. 12-cv-3419, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46368, 2014 WL 1280464 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 28, 2014), Dkt. 150-9; In re LIBOR-
Based Fin. Instruments Antitrust Litig. (LIBOR I), 935 F. Supp. 2d 666, 681 (S.D.N.Y.) rev'd Gelboim v. Bank of Am. Corp., 823 
F.3d 759 (2d Cir. 2016). "
514,13," Plaintiffs fail, however, to offer an explanation for why the pattern of downward swings around the PM Fixing returned in 2014. 
Id. ¶ 170 & chart."
514,14," Defendants point out, however, that the reports on which Plaintiffs rely for the premise that the majority of Defendants' 
derivative holdings were ""active trading positions"" actually reflect market-making positions that the Fixing Banks held to serve 
their clients. Defs.' Mem. at 12 n.6. "
515,15," As with most futures contracts, most holders of gold futures do not settle their futures contracts at maturation; rather they 
offset their positions before expiry by purchasing contracts for an equal opposite position. Id. ¶ 100. As a result, the holders of 
""long"" positions (who are obligated to purchase gold at an agreed-upon price in the future) profit when the price goes up 
because they are able to sell their offsetting contracts [**22]  at a higher price. Id. In contrast, the holders of ""short"" positions 
(who are obligated to sell gold at an agreed-upon price in the future) profit when the price goes down because they are able to 
buy an offsetting contract for a lower price. Id. Gold forwards work in the same way, but are traded OTC as opposed to via an 
exchange. Id. ¶¶ 95, 99."
515,16," Aggregate data tells the Court little about the actual position of any particular Defendant. The fact that in the aggregate large 
bullion banks were net short does not mean that any given Defendant was net short consistently or even occasionally."
515,17," Specifically, the SAC alleges that these downward spikes occurred [**23]  ""more frequently on days that would impact futures 
contracts the most."" Id. ¶ 227. The SAC is ambiguous as to whether Plaintiffs intend to allege that the impact on gold futures 
was greatest on these days because the effect of the PM Fixing on individual futures contracts would be most pronounced or 
because on these days the PM Fixing would affect the greatest number of futures contracts. The Court assumes—for purposes 
of this decision—that it is the latter."
515,18," Since the filing of the SAC, Barclays has pled guilty to a criminal charge in the United States and paid various settlements and 
fines in connection with manipulation of the FX markets. See, e.g., Steve Slater, Barclays Fined $2.4 Billion for FX Manipulation, "

the screen"" (placing fake orders to give the illusion of activity and then cancelling the orders when the fixing window closed), id. 
¶ 242; ""spoofing"" (placing large orders that are never executed), id. ¶ 8 n.2; and ""wash sales"" (placing large orders that are

517,20," While the Fixing Members do not address constitutional standing separately from antitrust standing, their arguments regarding 
Plaintiffs' alleged injuries are relevant to both inquiries. The Court must consider both in evaluating subject matter jurisdiction at 
the pleading stage. Lance v. Coffman, 549 U.S. 437, 439, 127 S. Ct. 1194, 167 L. Ed. 2d 29 (2007) (""Federal courts must 
determine that they have jurisdiction before proceeding to the merits.""). "
518,21," Section 4 of the Clayton provides: [A]ny person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue . 
. . in any district court of the United States in the district in which the defendant resides or is found or has an agent, without 
respect to the amount in controversy, and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained, and the cost of suit, 
including a reasonable attorney's fee."
518,15, U.S.C. § 15(a). 
519,22," In their Motion to Dismiss, the Fixing Banks originally argued that Plaintiffs failed to assert an antitrust injury because, even if 
accepted as true, Plaintiffs' alleged injuries would have resulted merely from Defendants' purported ""misrepresentation[s],"" not 
""from any anticompetitive aspect of defendants' conduct."" Defs.' Mem. at 36 n.13 (quoting LIBOR I, 935 F. Supp. 2d at 688). 
That argument was squarely rejected by the Second Circuit, which held that the manipulation of LIBOR rates by the 
benchmarking banks constituted [**34]  an anticompetitive practice that tended to ""warp[] . . . market factors affecting the prices 
for LIBOR-based financial instruments."" Gelboim, 823 F.3d at 776. The Fixing Banks have since withdrawn this argument based 
on LIBOR I. See Letter from Stephen Ehrenberg to the Court dated May 25, 2016, Dkt. 141 at 3. "
522,23," Plaintiffs' failure to allege that the Fix Price was the price (or an established component of the price) at which they transacted 
distinguishes this case from many of Plaintiffs' cited authorities. See Loeb Indus., Inc, 306 F.3d at 476, 494-95 (finding antitrust 
standing for certain copper purchasers alleging conspiracy to inflate copper futures prices where plaintiffs transacted at prices 
based on ""rigid formulas"" related to copper futures); In re Aluminum Warehousing Antitrust Litig., 95 F. Supp. 3d 419, 429-30, 
444 (S.D.N.Y. 2015), motion to certify appeal denied, No. 13-md-2481(KBF), 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87382, 2015 WL 4646822 
(S.D.N.Y. May 14, 2015) (finding antitrust standing for plaintiffs who alleged that defendants conspired to raise the 
""Midwest [**48]  Premium"" price, which was a component of plaintiffs' aluminum contracts). "
524,24," Because most of Plaintiffs' compelling facts, including those based on statistical analyses, are drawn from 2006 through 2012, 
Plaintiffs do not plausibly plead the existence of an antitrust conspiracy prior to 2006 or after 2012. See, e.g., SAC ¶¶ 152-53 & 
charts, 154 & charts, 156 & chart, 222 & chart; see also App. D (while a drop in intraday gold prices is seen in 2004, the pattern 
dissipates in 2005 and then returns in 2006-2012), App. E (no data provided for 2013); App. G (pattern seen for 2006-2012; no 
data provided for 2013); App. H (data available for May 2009 through February 2013). "
526,25," It should be noted that the complaint in this case is weaker than the complaint [**62]  in the similar case involving the Silver 
Fix. See In re London Silver Fixing, Ltd., Antitrust Litig., No. 14-md-2573 (VEC). "
527,26," Based on the parties' presentations at oral argument, this data reflects the combined positions of approximately 20 non-U.S. 
banks. [**64]  Tr. at 10:4-21, 65:24-67:12."
527,27," The CFTC data further appears to suggest that non-U.S. banks, ostensibly including the Defendants, were not ""net short"" for 
certain periods of time from 2008 to 2009. SAC ¶ 213 & chart."
527,28," Plaintiffs take issue with Defendants' suggestion that their short positions were hedged. Pls.' Opp. at 20-21. But Plaintiffs' 
theory fares no better without the presumption that Defendants generally held balanced portfolios. Without offsetting ""hedged"" 
positions, Defendants would have suffered staggering losses (not gains) on their alleged ""massive"" short holdings as the price of 
gold steadily rose throughout the Class Period. "
528,29," Plaintiffs' rebuttal that ""even if shorts were not generating such cash flows because prices were overall going up, suppressing 
the price would still create a daily, cash-benefit for the Defendant Banks because they would lose less cash to margin payments 
than they otherwise would have"" is unconvincing. Id. ¶ 221 n.42; Pls.' Opp. at 21 n.32. ""Losing less"" is simply not a plausible 
""common motive"" to support Plaintiffs' antitrust claims, even with respect to Defendants' hypothetical rogue traders who may 
have sought to ""maximize the returns (or limit the losses) of futures short positions,"" regardless of the Defendants' other 
investments and holdings. SAC [**68]  ¶ 224. "
529,30," The Fixing Banks cite to Reed Const. Data Inc. v. McGraw-Hill Cos., Inc., 49 F. Supp. 3d 385, 399 (S.D.N.Y. 2014), and Gen. 
Elec. Co. v. Joiner, 522 U.S. 136, 145-46, 118 S. Ct. 512, 139 L. Ed. 2d 508 (1997), but those decisions were based on pretrial 
and summary judgment motions to exclude expert testimony, not motions to dismiss. "
531,31," The Court further notes that [**80]  the Fixing Banks' reliance on DiMauro is misplaced. In DiMauro, the Second Circuit merely 
held that, at the summary judgment stage, in the absence of any evidence of a conspiracy, plaintiffs could not proceed on a 
theory that each defendant could alone have manipulated the market because a complaint that ""alleges collective action . . . 
cannot be allowed to proceed as if it alleges individual action."" DiMauro, 822 F.2d at 261. The Court does not read DiMauro as 
establishing an additional pleading element for plaintiffs alleging market manipulation claims based on concerted action. As 
other courts have acknowledged, the ability to influence a particular market is a fact-intensive determination and one that is not 
typically ripe for disposition at the pleading stage. Parnon, 875 F. Supp. 2d at 245. "
532,32," While the SAC alleges that this pattern is not common in other markets, SAC ¶¶ 172-189, similar allegations of anomalous 
pricing behavior have been made with respect to the market for silver bullion. See In re London Silver Fixing Antitrust Litig., No. 
14-md-0253 (VEC) (S.D.N.Y.)."
532,33," For the reasons stated in footnote 24, supra, Plaintiffs have not plausibly alleged a pattern of price manipulation prior to 2006 
or after 2012."
532,34," The Fixing [**84]  Members' arguments to the contrary are not so much inaccurate as they are off point. Defs.' Mem. at 38-42. 
As described supra the Court agrees that Plaintiffs' allegations regarding the Defendants' unhedged short positions are not well-
pleaded, and even if they were, they would be insufficient to establish a motive for price manipulation under the CEA. See In re 
Crude Oil Commodity Litig., 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 47902, 2007 WL 1946553, at *8 (a ""generalized [profit] motive"" is ""insufficient 
to show intent"" because it ""could be imputed to any corporation with a large market presence in any commodity market"") 
(citations omitted). "
533,35," While the Court agrees with Defendants that Plaintiffs' claims are considerably weaker than those raised in other benchmark 
fixing cases, the Fixing Banks' suggestion that reckless intent cannot be alleged without direct evidence is incorrect. Defs.' Mem. 
at 42-43. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b) (""Malice, intent, knowledge, and other conditions of a person's mind may [**86]  be alleged 
generally.""); see also In re Amaranth Nat. Gas Commodities Litig., 730 F.3d at 185 (evidence of trading behavior involving 
""wait[ing] until the final minutes of trading to sell large quantities of a particular future"" could ""strongly suggest"" manipulation). 
Because ""proof of intent will most often be circumstantial in nature, manipulative intent must normally be shown inferentially from 
the conduct of the accused."" Parnon, 875 F. Supp. 2d at 249 (quoting In re Ind. Farm Bureau Coop. Ass'n, No. 75-14, 1982 
CFTC LEXIS 25, 1982 WL 30249, at *7 (CFTC Dec. 17, 1982))."
533,36," The Fixing Banks contend that no inference of causation can be drawn because Defendants are only alleged to have quoted 
prices that were, on average, .007% lower than those quoted by others in the market. Defs.' Mem. at 44 (citing SAC ¶ 263). But 
Plaintiffs do not allege that the Defendants suppressed the Fix Price every day; rather they allege that the Defendants engaged 
in manipulation on specified days when anomalous price swings were observed around the PM Fixing. Therefore, the Court's 
analysis does not depend on Defendants' ""average"" trading activity, but rather Defendants' trading around the PM Fixing on 
days when the Fix Price was allegedly [**88]  manipulated. "
534,37," The Court notes that, in contrast to Plaintiffs' price manipulation claims, Plaintiffs' manipulative device claims under Section 
6(c)(1) and 17 C.F.R. 180.1 require scienter to be proven by intentional or reckless conduct. See 17 C.F.R. § 180.1(a); 
Prohibition on Manipulative and Deceptive Devices, 76 Fed. Reg. at 41,404; CFTC v. Kraft Foods Grp., Inc., 153 F. Supp. 3d 
996, 1014-15 (N.D. Ill. 2015), motion to certify appeal denied, No. 15 C 2881, 195 F. Supp. 3d 996, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
93533, 2016 WL 3907027 (N.D. Ill. July 19, 2016). [**91]  Because the Court has already found that Plaintiffs alleged strong 
circumstantial evidence of conscious misbehavior or recklessness, this element has been adequately alleged. "
535,38," The SAC's relatively thin principal-agent allegations reflect in part the posture of this case. None of the individual defendants, 
presumably employees of the Fixing Banks, has been identified, and there has been no document discovery. Assuming this 
case reaches the summary judgment stage, Plaintiffs will be required to adduce significantly more evidence establishing that 
agents of the Fixing Banks violated the CEA and did so acting within the scope of their employment. "
538,39," Notably, Plaintiffs do not claim to be clients of UBS who suffered losses as a result of UBS front-running their orders or 
triggering their stop loss orders. See SAC ¶¶ 301-02. Rather Plaintiffs allege that they ""suffered harm in respect of the sales they 
conducted where the relevant sales price was artificially lowered by collusive manipulation"" by the Defendants' in connection 
with the PM Fixing. SAC ¶¶ 323-28. "
539,40," Citing Daniel v. Am. Bd. of Emergency Medicine, 428 F.3d 408, 423 (2d Cir. 2005), LGMF asserts that statutory personal 
jurisdiction under the Sherman Act—and seemingly under the CEA—is proper only if Plaintiffs can show that venue is proper 
because ""LGMF is 'an inhabitant,' 'may be found,' or 'transacts business' in this district."" LGMF Mem. at 3. This argument is at 
best a red herring. Daniel requires a plaintiff establishing jurisdiction under the Sherman Act to also satisfy the coordinate venue 
provision quoted-above. Daniel, 428 F.3d at 423. The jurisdictional provision of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. § 25, is phrased differently 
and has not been interpreted to require plaintiffs to also satisfy the CEA's parallel venue provision. See In re Libor-Based Fin. 
Instruments Antitrust Litig., No. 11-md-2262 (NRB), 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 149629, 2015 WL 6696407, at *19 n.28. Thus, 
Plaintiffs [**109]  need not satisfy the venue provision of the CEA (or the Clayton Act) for personal jurisdiction to be proper under 
the CEA, and, as Plaintiffs explain, personal jurisdiction under the CEA is adequate to establish supplementary jurisdiction over 
Plaintiffs' other claims. Pl.'s Mem. Opp. LGMF at 8 n.12."
539,41," Because the Court concludes that LGMF is the Fixing Banks' alter ego it need not reach Plaintiffs' arguments that personal 
jurisdiction is proper under a ""conspiracy jurisdiction"" theory. Pls.' Opp. LGMF at 7-8. It also is unnecessary to consider the 
parties arguments regarding the application of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 4(k)(1) and 4(k)(2). "
540,42," Moreover, the Supreme Court made clear that an agency relationship remains relevant to assertions of specific [**111]  
jurisdiction. Id. at 759 n.13."
540,43," While LGMF suggests that English law may govern whether the Court may pierce LGMF's corporate veil, LGMF has not 
provided any indication that there is a ""true conflict of laws"" between English law and New York law on this point. In the absence 
of a true conflict, the Court will apply New York law. See Int'l Equity Invs., Inc., 475 F. Supp. 2d at 458-59 (applying New York 
law to veil-piercing analysis in the absence of any identified conflict between New York and English law). Likewise, although 
Plaintiffs suggest that Federal common law, rather than New York law may govern, there is no discernable [**112]  difference 
with respect to the issues here. See Wajilam Exports (Singapore) Pte. Ltd. v. ATL Shipping Ltd., 475 F. Supp. 2d 275, 284 n.10 
(S.D.N.Y. 2006) (Federal common law and New York law of veil-piercing are not ""meaningfully"" distinct); see also Lakah, 996 F. 
Supp. 2d at 260 (""the Second Circuit's common law standard [for veil piercing] is taken directly from New York law""). "
554,1," Named entities include Deutsche Bank AG and its subsidiaries and affiliates, including Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. On April 
13, 2016, Plaintiffs notified the Court that they had reached a settlement with Deutsche Bank, although no motion for approval of 
a settlement class has yet been presented to the Court."
554,2," Named entities include [**2]  HSBC Holdings plc and its subsidiaries and affiliates, including HSBC Bank USA, N.A."
554,3," Named entities include Bank of Nova Scotia and its subsidiaries, affiliates and divisions, including Defendant Scotia Capital 
(USA) Inc. and ScotiaMocatta."
554,4," While the named Plaintiffs characterize themselves as those who ""purchased and/or sold"" [**3]  silver investments, Plaintiffs' 
claimed damages focus on investors who sold silver investments at allegedly artificially depressed prices during the Class 
Period. See Second Consolidated Class Action Complaint, Appendix D. "
555,5," Unless otherwise noted, citations to the docket shall be to the MDL case docket for these consolidated actions, 14-md-2573."
555,6, The facts are taken from the Second Amended Complaint. 
557,7," Despite the fact that the Class Period begins in 1999, most of the aberrational pricing patterns alleged by Plaintiffs do not 
emerge until 2007. See id. App'x A, B."
557,8," Plaintiffs' data shows a similarly significant, though slightly smaller, price decline around the closing of the COMEX trading day. 
See id. Fig. 3."
557,9," Notably, one of the experts relied on by Plaintiffs takes the position that these downward swings may have been part of a short-
term trading strategy. See Defs.' Mem. at 24-25 (citing Ex. 1). Defendants [**12]  argue that Plaintiffs' claim of ""persistence"" fails 
as a result, but this simply raises a question of fact—an interesting one and one that could have a profound effect on damages 
and class certification—that cannot be resolved at the pleading stage. "
558,10," Plaintiffs further allege that Defendants were particularly well-positioned to profit from their advance knowledge of the Fix Price 
due to their ""large unhedged trading positions."" Id. ¶¶ 208-212 & Figs. 48-51. This conclusion is substantially undermined, 
however, by the fact that Plaintiffs lack data on Defendants' trading positions with respect to silver, in particular, and they also 
lack comparative hedging information for UBS and Deutsche Bank. Id. "
559,11," During oral argument on Defendants' Motion to Dismiss, Defendants noted, however, that DOJ's Antitrust Division had closed 
its investigation into alleged manipulation of the precious metals benchmarks. Transcript of Oral Argument dated April 18, 2016 
(""Tr."") at 8:5-9:13. "
560,12," HSBC was also sanctioned by the CFTC in connection with manipulation of the FX markets. Id. ¶ 219 & n.45. Among other 
things, the CFTC found that HSBC traders had shared the ""size and direction of [HSBC]'s net orders"" in private chatrooms with 
other traders. Id."
560,13," Plaintiffs' theory appears to be that, because the same personnel may have been responsible for trading FX and precious 
metals, misconduct in the FX markets may [**23]  have been duplicated in the silver market. Id. ¶ 13. "
561,14," While the Fixing Members do not address constitutional standing separately from antitrust standing, their arguments regarding 
Plaintiffs' alleged injuries are relevant to both inquiries. The Court must consider both in evaluating subject matter jurisdiction at 
the pleading stage. Lance v. Coffman, 549 U.S. 437, 439, 127 S. Ct. 1194, 167 L. Ed. 2d 29 (2007) HN4[
] (""Federal courts 
must determine that they have jurisdiction before proceeding to the merits."")."
561,15," Section 4 of the Clayton provides: [A]ny person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue . 
. . in any district court of the United States in the district in which the defendant resides or is found or has an agent, without 
respect to the amount in controversy, and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained, and the cost of suit, 
including a reasonable attorney's fee."
561,15, U.S.C. § 15(a). 
562,16," In their Motion to Dismiss, the Fixing Members originally argued that Plaintiffs failed to assert an antitrust injury because, even 
if accepted as true, Plaintiffs' alleged injuries would have resulted merely from Defendants' purported ""misrepresentation[s]"" 
rather than an ""anticompetitive aspect"" of Defendants' conduct. Defs.' Mem. [**29]  at 33 (quoting In re LIBOR-Based Fin. 
Instruments Antitrust Litig. (""LIBOR I""), 935 F. Supp. 2d 666, 688 (S.D.N.Y. 2013), vacated and remanded sub nom. Gelboim, 
823 F.3d 759). That argument was squarely rejected by the Second Circuit, which held that the manipulation of LIBOR rates by 
the benchmarking banks constituted an anticompetitive practice that tended to ""warp[] . . . market factors affecting the prices for 
LIBOR-based financial instruments."" Gelboim, 823 F.3d at 776. The Fixing Members have since withdrawn this argument based 
on LIBOR I. See Letter from Michael Lacovara to the Court dated May 25, 2016, Dkt. 128 at 3. "
564,17," In the FAC, Plaintiffs alleged that ""commercial silver traders use the prices of COMEX silver futures contracts to calculate the 
spot market price of silver,"" FAC ¶ 122, which appears to be the inverse of the relationship that Plaintiffs now plead. 
Nonetheless, because Plaintiff have consistently alleged that variations in closing prices for COMEX futures are 99.85% 
attributable to the Fix Price, FAC ¶ 121, SAC ¶ 114, and that spot prices also closely track the Fix Price, this inconsistency in 
Plaintiff's pleadings [**36]  may be not as significant as the Fixing Members urge. Defs.' Mem. at 10. "
566,18," Plaintiffs' failure to allege that the Fix Price was the price (or an established component of the price) at which they transacted 
distinguishes this case from many of Plaintiffs' cited authorities. See Loeb, 306 F.3d at 476, 494-95 (finding antitrust standing for 
certain copper purchasers alleging conspiracy to inflate copper futures prices when plaintiffs transacted at prices based on ""rigid 
formulas"" related to copper futures); In re Aluminum Warehousing Antitrust Litig., 95 F. Supp. 3d 419, 429-30, 444 (S.D.N.Y. 
2015), motion to certify appeal denied, No. 13-md-2481(KBF), 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87382, 2015 WL 4646822 (S.D.N.Y. May 
14, 2015) (finding antitrust standing [**44]  for plaintiffs who alleged that defendants conspired to raise the ""Midwest Premium"" 
price, which was a component of plaintiffs' aluminum contracts); In re Foreign Exch. Benchmark Rates Antitrust Litig., 74 F. 
Supp. 3d at 587 (antitrust standing found for plaintiffs who were forced to pay supracompetitive prices when they purchased FX 
instruments from defendants ""priced at or by the Fix [price]""). "
568,19," Because most of Plaintiffs' compelling facts, including those based on statistical analyses, are drawn from January 1, 2007 
through December 31, 2013, Plaintiffs do not plausibly plead the existence of an antitrust conspiracy prior to [**50]  2007 or after 
2013. See, e.g., SAC ¶¶ 179-80, 185-97 & Figs. 35-42. Furthermore, the Court has absolutely no basis, apart from conjecture, to 
assume that Defendants' conduct continued beyond the conversion of the fixing call to an automated process involving other 
unidentified banking participants in August 2014. "
570,20," On the other hand, the Court is not persuaded by Plaintiffs' argument that Defendants stood to benefit from the alleged 
conspiracy because they held ""large, unhedged positions in the precious metals markets."" SAC ¶¶ 208-212 & Figs. 49-51. 
Based on Plaintiffs' proffered data, the only bank with a ""large unhedged trading position"" throughout [**59]  the Class Period 
appears to be HSBC, but the supporting data includes all of HSBC's foreign exchange and precious metals trading, which gives 
little insight into its position specifically in the silver market. SAC ¶ 208 & Fig. 48. The Bank of Nova Scotia did not take on a 
large hedging position until 2011, and again, that position reflects its total derivatives positions, telling the Court nothing about its 
position specifically in the silver market. Id. ¶ 209& Fig. 49. Plaintiffs present no comparative data for UBS, id. ¶ 210 & Fig. 50, or 
Deutsche Bank, id. ¶ 211 & Fig. 51. "
571,21," Notably, the Fixing Members acknowledge this point, when it suits their interest, in arguing that Plaintiffs lack CEA standing 
because Plaintiffs allege a pattern of ""isolated (though repeated) manipulative activity"" while failing to allege that they transacted 
at a time during which prices were artificially suppressed. Defs.' Mem. at 44-45."
571,22," Plaintiffs counter that at least some of the expert analyses relied upon were published prior to Plaintiffs' filing of the initial 
complaint and therefore were presumably performed independently of any compensated work for Plaintiffs. Pls.' Opp. at 3. 
Whether Plaintiffs brought their complaint because of such reports or procured expert analyses after deciding to bring their 
complaint is immaterial because the Court cannot evaluate the reliability of Plaintiffs' experts at the pleading stage."
571,23," The Fixing Members cite to Reed Constr. Data Inc. v. McGraw-Hill Cos., 49 F. Supp. 3d 385, 399 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) and Gen. 
Elec. Co. v. Joiner, 522 U.S. 136, 145-46, 118 S. Ct. 512, 139 L. Ed. 2d 508 (1997), but those decisions were based on pretrial 
and summary judgment motions to exclude expert testimony, not motions to dismiss."
571,24," The Fixing Members' argument that Plaintiffs' experts endorse ""obvious alternative explanations"" to Plaintiffs' theory is based 
on a misreading of Plaintiffs' expert's report. Defs.' Mem. at 24-25 (citing Ex. 1 (Caminschi) at 51-52). The report actually 
concluded that, although fixing results could be [**64]  ""driven by the price changes observed in the public markets,"" the ""more 
plausible"" theory is that ""short-term prices of public traded instruments are driven by the London silver fixing,"" i.e., by the Fixing 
Members. Pls.' Opp. at 6 (citing Ex. 1 (Caminschi) at 51-52). "
574,25," For the reasons stated in footnote 19, supra, Plaintiffs have not plausibly alleged a pattern of price manipulation prior to 2007 
or after 2013."
574,26," The Fixing Members' arguments to the contrary are not so much inaccurate as they are off point. Defs.' Mem. at 36-37. As 
described supra the Court agrees that Plaintiffs' allegations regarding the Defendants' ""large, unhedged positions in the precious 
metals markets"" are not well-pleaded, and even if they were, they would be insufficient [**74]  to establish a motive for price 
manipulation under the CEA. See In re Crude Oil Commodity Litig., 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 47902, 2007 WL 1946553, at *8 
HN31[
] (a ""generalized [profit] motive"" is ""insufficient to show intent"" because it ""could be imputed to any corporation with a 
large market presence in any commodity market"") (citations omitted). "
576,27," The Court notes that, in contrast to Plaintiffs' price manipulation claims, Plaintiffs' HN36[
] manipulative device claims under Section 6(c)(1) and 17 C.F.R. 180.1 require scienter to be proven by intentional or reckless conduct. See 17 C.F.R. § 180.1(a); 
Prohibition on Manipulative and Deceptive Devices, 76 Fed. Reg. at 41,404; CFTC v. Kraft Foods Grp., Inc., 153 F. Supp. 3d 
996, 1014-15 (N.D. Ill. 2015), motion to certify appeal denied, No. 15 C 2881, 195 F. Supp. 3d 996, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
93533, 2016 WL 3907027 (N.D. Ill. July 19, 2016). Because the Court has already found that Plaintiffs alleged strong 
circumstantial evidence of conscious misbehavior or recklessness, this element has been adequately alleged. "
577,28," Finally, the Fixing Members argue that Plaintiffs' manipulative device claim should be dismissed because it is predicated on an 
""insider trading"" theory but fails to allege that Defendants owed Plaintiffs a fiduciary duty. Defs.' Mem. at 43 (citing Chiarella v. 
United States, 445 U.S. 222, 228, 100 S. Ct. 1108, 63 L. Ed. 2d 348 (1980)). In support of this theory, the Fixing Members argue 
that: ""[U]nlike securities markets, derivatives markets have long operated in a way that allows for market participants to trade on 
the basis of lawfully obtained material nonpublic information."" Defs.' Mem. at 44 (quoting Prohibition on Manipulative and 
Deceptive Devices, 76 Fed. Reg. at 41,403). Be that as it may, as described supra, Plaintiffs' [**82]  manipulation allegations are 
not necessarily akin to a claim of ""insider trading,"" and even if they were, the Fixing Members have not argued that the facts, 
viewed in the light most favorable to the Plaintiffs, demonstrate that the Fixing Members were trading on information that was 
""lawfully obtained."" "
578,29," The SAC's relatively thin principal-agent allegations reflect in part the posture of this case. None of the Jane Doe defendants, 
presumably employees of the Fixing Members, has been identified, and there has been no document discovery. Assuming this 
case reaches the summary judgment stage, Plaintiffs [**85]  will be required to adduce significantly more evidence establishing 
that agents of the Fixing Members violated the CEA and did so acting within the scope of their employment."
578,30," The first Interim Lead Plaintiffs filed a complaint in this action on July 25, 2014. See Complaint, Nicholson v. Bank of Nova 
Scotia, No. 14-cv-5682 (VEC) (S.D.N.Y. July 25, 2014) (Dkt. 1). "
579,31," Defendants argue that Plaintiffs cannot claim ignorance of the alleged manipulation because four of the named Plaintiffs filed 
class action lawsuits in 2010 and 2011 against HSBC and others for suppressing silver prices. Defs.' Mem. at 49 n.34. As with 
the 2008 CFTC investigation, however, those complaints involved substantially different misconduct, which apart from alleging 
price suppression, had nothing to do with the manipulation of the Silver Fixing alleged here."
579,32," Defendants' argument that the Plaintiffs were on inquiry notice due to obvious ""red flags"" regarding the lack of accountability 
and oversight over the Silver Fixing is misplaced. Defs.' Mem. at 48. Just as these structural factors were not sufficient to 
constitute ""plus factors"" in support of Plaintiffs' conspiracy claims, neither are they sufficient to put Plaintiffs on inquiry notice. "
581,33," Notably, Plaintiffs do not claim to be clients of UBS who suffered losses as a result of UBS front-running their orders or 
triggering their stop loss orders. [**96]  See UBS FINMA Report at 12. Rather Plaintiffs allege that they ""suffered harm in the 
sales they conducted on days where the price of silver was artificially lower because of Defendants' manipulative conduct"" in 
artificially suppressing the price of silver ""by using the Silver Fix and conducting manipulative trading."" SAC ¶¶ 231-32. "
584,1," The plaintiff dealers are located in four different states: (i) two in Illinois (Napleton's Arlington Heights and Napleton's River 
Oaks); (ii) three in Florida (Napleton's Clermont, Napleton's Northlake, and Napleton's South Orlando); (iii) one in Missouri 
(Napleton's Mid Rivers); and (iv) one in Pennsylvania (Napleton's Ellwood City, Inc.). (Dkt. No. 21 at ¶¶ 13-19.)"
584,2," The FCA, also commonly known as Chrysler, is a manufacturer and distributor of new and unused Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, and 
Ram brand vehicles. (Id. at ¶ 22.) "
585,3," FCA established a network of business centers (""Business Centers"") that was each responsible for various districts that FCA 
created throughout the country. Each Business Center was headed by a Business Center Director. (Id. at ¶ 34.)"
585,4," Plaintiffs allege eight specific instances as proof of the existence of the scheme. (See Dkt. No. 21 at ¶ 38.) Each of the 
instances reflects a situation in which FCA requested a dealer or group of dealers to either submit false NVDRs or false reports 
regarding a number of vehicles. For example, Plaintiffs allege that on June 1, 2015, an FCA employee and District Manager for 
portions of the northern Illinois requested that Napleton's River Oaks falsely report 23 vehicles in return for $15,000. (Id. at ¶ 
38(a).) On that same day, the FCA Business Director for the Midwest Region allegedly asked his District Managers to request 
certain dealers — only those who exceeded their sales targets numbers established by the Volume Growth Program — to 
submit false NVDRs in return for payment of incentives. (Id. at ¶ 38(b).)"
585,5," The [**9]  scheme was allegedly ""no harm, no foul"" because the FCA would permit the dealers to later disavow the false sales, 
i.e. by ""backing-out"" the NVDRs, even after the FCA had reported and recorded the NVDRs as sales. (Dkt. No. 21 at ¶ 46.)"
585,6," The parties also refer to the Dealer Agreements as Franchise Agreements. For clarity's sake, the Court will refer to the 
agreements as Dealer Agreements solely. "
586,7," Plaintiffs further allege that the FCA calculates the MSR ""by determining the number of new vehicle registrations for FCA's 
vehicle lines in the geographical market area established by FCA (referred to under the Franchise Agreements as ""CC Sales 
Zones""), and then computing the number of retail sales FCA deems necessary for those vehicle lines to purportedly achieve 
statewide market share."" (Id. at ¶ 58) The boundaries of the CC Sales Zones are established by the FCA in its sole discretion. 
(Id. at ¶¶ 58-59.) "
587,8," Plaintiffs allege that they blew the whistle on the false reporting by both raising the issue to FCA and by filing the present 
lawsuit. (See Dkt. No. 21 at ¶¶ 45, 111.)"
587,9," The FCA also contends that the claim must be dismissed because Plaintiffs did not allege that they ""even failed to receive a 
vehicle to which they were entitled."" (Dkt. No. 53 at 9.) However, threatened coercion, as the Plaintiffs adequately allege here, is "
588,," all that is required. See Northview Motors, Inc. v. Chrysler Motors Corp., 227 F.3d 78, 93 (3d Cir. 2000) (""The case law plainly 
requires actual, or threatened, coercion or intimidation as an element of an ADDCA claim."")."
588,10," Primary-lines cases involve discrimination that injures competition at the level of the discriminating seller and its direct 
competitors. Secondary-line cases involve injuries to discriminating seller's customers (here, the Plaintiff dealerships). Tertiary-
line cases involve injury to competition among the customers of differently treated purchasers. See Volvo Trucks, 546 U.S. at 
176."
588,11," The FCA does not dispute that the Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that the relevant sales took place in interstate commerce 
or that the sales were of similar products. "
589,12," In response to the Court noting that these dealers were identified in the Amended Complaint [**22]  during oral argument, 
FCA's counsel argued that the Amended Complaint was nevertheless insufficient because it did not mention ""that those two 
dealers are a competing dealer. [Plaintiffs] don't allege that."" (Dkt. No. 58 at 11:24-14:5.) However, paragraph 38 of the 
Amended Complaint states that FCA is in the best position to ""identify all those Conspiring Dealers...[n]onetheless, Plaintiffs 
have independently learned"" certain facts, including the existence of the communications between Sherman, Northwestern, and 
FCA. (Dkt. No. 21 at ¶ 38.) Taking all reasonable inferences in the Plaintiffs' favor, the Court infers that Sherman and 
Northwestern are two of the many Conspiring Dealers referred to in the Amended Complaint. "
590,13," Having found that Plaintiffs sufficiently allege competitive injury through the Morton Salt presumption, the Court need not 
assess the diversion of sales element at length. However, the Court expresses doubt that Plaintiffs have alleged sufficient facts 
to show that the alleged discrimination caused a diversion of sales as Plaintiffs have failed to state facts showing their monthly 
revenue or sales declined during the same period of time as the incentive program. See, e.g., Mathew Enter., Inc. v. Chrysler 
Grp. LLC, No. 13-CV-04236-BLF, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 95522, 2014 WL 3418545, at *7 (N.D. Cal. July 11, 2014) (Court 
denying motion to dismiss similar claim where, unlike here, the plaintiff specifically alleged the value of lost incentives ($1.1 
million in volume growth incentives to $26,200 after loss of incentives), and demonstrated that its monthly sales declined by a 
specific amount without the benefit of the subsidies while the conspiring dealer's sales increased ""during that same period when 
it reaped the benefits of the incentive program."")."
590,14," Although the Seventh Circuit has yet to examine whether Rule 9(b)'s heightened standard applies to every element of a RICO 
claim, the Seventh Circuit has ""explicitly applied the Rule 9 standard to RICO's enterprise elements."" Richmond v. Nationwide 
Cassel L.P., 52 F.3d 640, 644 (7th Cir. 1995). Accordingly, ""this Court applies the traditional Rule 8 standard to the non-fraud 
elements of the RICO claims, and the stricter Rule 9(b) standard to the underlying allegations of fraud-based racketeering 
activity within those claims (here, the mail and wire fraud predicates themselves)."" See, e.g., Menzies v. Seyfarth Shaw LLP, No. 
15 C 3403, 197 F. Supp. 3d 1076, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 92765, 2016 WL 3854626, at *2 (N.D. Ill. July 15, 2016). "
592,15," During oral argument, Plaintiffs' counsel alluded to additional harms that the Plaintiffs suffered due to the scheme: ""And we 
also allege, Judge, in terms of the damages, there are all sorts of things that flow from lost sales that when you don't get a car at 
a sale, you're not doing — probably getting the subsequent resale, you're not getting the repairs, and so forth. That's down the 
line, I admit."" (Dkt. No. 58 at 96:1-5.) Even setting aside the proximate cause issues (including the inherent difficulty [**34]  in 
calculating such damages), Plaintiffs allegations are inadequate as they fail to provide any actual instance where they were 
unable to sell a specific car or model that could have led to those ""down the line"" harms due to the scheme. Such information — 
shortages, inability to receive a specific model type, etc. — would be in the Plaintiff's possession. The lack of factual 
enhancement is damning to the Plaintiffs' civil RICO claims under Anza and Bridge. "
594,16," Another issue implicit in this holding is that Plaintiffs fail to provide the specifics underlying the alleged misrepresentations. For 
example, Plaintiffs' argument that they were induced to ""make capital investments and enter other agreements"" is factually 
deficient in that it fails to provide any detail regarding what those other misrepresentations were, [**41]  who made them, and 
when they were made, among other issues. Such allegations fall well short of the Rule 9(b) standard. See Camasta, 761 F.3d at 
737. "
597,17," Importantly, the FCA has not provided, and the Court has not found, any case law requiring that specifics of the type required 
to plead a civil RICO claim are necessary for state a claim under these state statutes. As such, while the allegations regarding, 
for example, denial of access to popular models are insufficient to establish a civil RICO claim as discussed above, they are 
sufficient for the state law claims. "
601,1," The December 4, 2014 CMT-Flywheel contract is the basis for CMT's breach of contract and other claims. However, the [*4]  
two counterclaims at issue in this motion allege restraint of trade based on the underlying CMT-taxi fleet partner contracts. The 
details of the December 4, 2014 CMT-Flywheel contract, which are currently under seal, are not relevant to the present motion 
to dismiss the counterclaims. "
603,2," The Court notes that CMT argues, and Flywheel does not contest, that exclusive-dealing relationships are not per se unlawful 
restraints of trade. Mot. at 7 (citing Allied Orthopedic Appliances, Inc. v. Tyco Health Care Group LP, 592 F.3d 991, 996 (9th Cir. 
2010)); Oppo. at 5 (citing Corwin v. Los Angeles Newspaper Service Bureau Inc., 4 Cal. 3d 842, 853, 94 Cal. Rptr. 785, 484 
P.2d 953 (1971)). Thus, both parties focus their arguments on whether the alleged restraint of trade is unreasonable. "
607,1," Pursuant to S.D. Ohio Civ. R. 79.3 and paragraph 14 of the Stipulated Protective Order (Doc. 43), this Order contains citations 
to exhibits, deposition testimony, and other documents produced in this case that have been designated ""Confidential"" or ""Highly 
Confidential—Outside Counsels Eyes Only."" Accordingly, this Order is docketed under seal."
607,2," Defendants include Premier Health Partners, Atrium Health System, Catholic Health Initiatives, MedAmerica Health Systems 
Corporation, Samaritan Health Partners, and UVMC (collectively ""Defendants"")."
607,3," See also the parties' undisputed facts at Doc. 129, Ex. 1; Doc. 130, Ex. 1; Doc. 132, Ex. 1; Doc. 133, Ex. 1; and Doc. 139, Ex. 
1. "
610,4," See also Com-Tel, Inc. v. DuKane Corp., 669 F.2d 404, 409 (6th Cir. 1982) (evidence of horizontal concerted action in boycott 
demanded application of per se doctrine); Klor's, Inc. v. Broadway-Hale Stores, 359 U.S. 207, 212, 79 S. Ct. 705, 3 L. Ed. 2d 
741 (1959) (group boycotts with horizontal concerted action are per se illegal regardless of justification, even when they 
operated to lower prices)."
610,5," The ancillary restraint doctrine provided that an otherwise unlawful restraint may be lawful if ""ancillary to the main purpose of a 
lawful contract..."" United States v. Addyston Pipe & Steel Co., 85 F. 271, 282 (6th Cir. 1898)."
610,6," Defendants' managed care agreements with Dayton payers contained provisions restricting the number and/or identity of 
hospitals that a particular payer could have in its managed care networks (herein referred to as ""Panel Limitations"")."
610,7," Insurers enter into contracts with hospitals and other health care providers to purchase health care services. (Doc. 128-17 at 
52, 55, 283-84, 288-89). The insurers then create networks of those providers that they sell to employers or other groups that 
offer health care services to their members. (Id. at 53-54, 59-60, 285-86). Because they are buyers, insurers seek to negotiate 
discounted rates in their negotiations with hospitals. (Id. at 55-56, 283-85, 288-89). Hospitals, in turn, seek patients, and "
611,," hospitals are often willing to accept discounted prices in return for the expectation of increased patient volume. (Id. at 283-84, 
288). The ensuing contracts between hospitals and insurers often link discounted rates to access to an expected volume of 
parties. (Doc. 128-40 at 555; Doc. 128-14 at 63; Doc. 128-28 at 45; Doc. 128-37 at 43). The expected volume can be realized 
either because the insurer offers a large number of members or because the insurer limits the size of its hospital network and in 
that way channels its volume to fewer hospitals. (Doc. 128-17 at 283-84, 286, 288). Such volume-based pricing is prevalent in 
managed care contracting in the Dayton area and elsewhere across the United States. (Doc. 128-7 at 69-73). However, here, 
there is no record evidence demonstrating the rate for volume analyses regarding any of the managed care contracts. MCEP requested this information in discovery but none was produced. Moreover, there is no evidence that Defendants 
increased rates when payers successfully negotiated Panel Limitations out of their contracts. UHC negotiated the Panel 
Limitation out of the 2010 managed care contract with the Defendants. (Doc. 128-8 at 271). UHC stated that it had no knowledge 
that rates were affected. (Id. at 327). MMO did not have to give a rate concession to eliminate its Panel Limitations from the 
Defendants' contract. (Doc. 128-14 at 193). Similarly, Humana had no knowledge of any effect on rates where it removed the 
Panel Limitation from its 2010 contract. (Doc. 149-18 at ¶¶ 6, 9, 10). Third, the Panel Limitations are the way Defendants keep a 
payer's volume ""static."" (Doc. 128-33 at 244). In other words, they reduce competition for the volume. None of the contracts 
guarantee them any volume, so Defendants have to compete with the in-network KHN hospitals for any volume. (Id. at 185) 
(Defendants have to compete with KHN for UHC, notwithstanding the Panel Limitation)). Further, Defendants must acknowledge 
that a new hospital could just as likely take volume from KHN (which, by the way, does not have this provision in any of its 
managed care contracts) rather than the Defendants."
611,8," The ancillary restraint doctrine requires undisputed proof (at summary judgment) that the ""non-venture"" activity (the agreement 
to exclude a rival from the payer's network) is joint conduct that is necessary for the Defendants to achieve whatever efficiency-
enhancing purpose collective negotiation brings and that there are not less restrictive alternatives. FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION, 
ANTITRUST GUIDELINES FOR COLLABORATIONS AMONG COMPETITORS at 24. Defendants fail to make this showing."
611,9," The per se rule applies to conduct taken under the mantle of a joint venture when the challenged restraint is not reasonably 
related to any of the efficiency-enhancing benefits of a joint venture, and serves instead only as a naked restraint against 
competition. See, e.g., Rothery Storage & Van Co. v. Atlas Van Lines, 792 F.2d 210, 229, 253 U.S. App. D.C. 142 (D.C. Cir. 
1986)."
611,10," In fact, the Sixth Circuit determined that MCEP submitted evidence sufficient to demonstrate that the group boycott underlying 
its Section 1 claim involves two discrete horizontal agreements: (1) an agreement among the Defendants as separate actors and 
competitors of MCEP to prevent MCEP from competing, including precluding MCEP from obtaining managed care contracts 
from insurers; and (2) an agreement among those insurers, orchestrated and monitored by the Defendants' concerted action, not 
to offer MCEP a managed care contract. Med. Ctr. at Elizabeth Place, 817 F.3d at 941-43. "
612,11," See, e.g., Re/Max Int'l, Inc. v. Realty One, Inc., 173 F.3d 995, 1009 (6th Cr. 1999) (evidence that conduct would have been 
contrary to conspirator's self-interest without the conspiracy constitutes circumstantial proof of agreement); Capital Imaging 
Assocs. v. Mohawk Valley Med. Assocs., 996 F.2d 537, 545 (2nd Cir. 1993) (evidence that defendant ignored its own standards 
in determining whether to deal with plaintiff ""strongly suggests"" that its stated reason for denial might be a sham supporting the 
inference of an agreement)."
612,12, UHC is the second largest private payer in the Dayton area.
612,13," See, e.g., A Dayton Daily News article reported ""Premier Health Partners has included language in Anthem's and some other 
insurers' contracts that disqualifies Dayton Heart from their networks."" (""Dayton Heart now in Anthem Fold,"" Dayton Daily News 
(January 21, 2005)). Another article reported ""Premier Health Partners routinely requires insurers to leave Dayton Heart out of 
their networks if they want to include Premier's market-leading system."" (Insurance deals often leave out Dayton Heart; Premier 
Health Partners says specialty hospital siphons more profitable serves away from its hospital group,"" Dayton Daily News (July 
22, 2007)). A 2008 industry report available to payers states ""Premier has threatened to revoke privileges for physicians 
participating in Elizabeth Place and contracts with health plans such as Anthem and United Health[care] are known to be 
contingent on excluding those [physician-owned hospital] facilities from the network."" (HealthLeaders InterStudy, ""Dayton Market 
Overview 2008,"" at 7-8 (April 2008), Doc. 146 at 122207, 122213-14). This evidence establishes that the understanding between 
Defendants and payers existed. Heartland Surgical Specialty Hosp. v. Midwest Div., Inc., 527 F. Supp. 2d 1257, 1307-08 (D. 
Kan. 2007) (evidence that rival hospital defendants discussed publicly the competitive threat of specialty hospitals and that any 
payers were able to negotiate lower reimbursement rates in exchange for including network configuration clauses to exclude 
plaintiff ""permit[s] an inference of conspiracy"")."
612,14, MMO is the third largest private payer in the Dayton area. 
613,15," DHH was a physician-owned cardiac specialty hospital in Dayton from September 1999 until May 2008, when Defendant 
Good Samaritan Hospital purchased it for $55 million and merged it out of existence. (Tab 116 — PX475 at 2)."
613,16," KHN is a healthcare system in Dayton and is comprised of seven acute care hospitals. It acquired 50% ownership in MCEP 
effective December 31, 2008. (Doc. 141-2 at 1). "
614,17, EHN formed one of the first PPOs in Ohio. http://tinyurl.com/mudldqd.
614,18, HealthSpan offers a PPO product to employers in Dayton that self-insure. (Doc. 128-28 at 19-20).
614,19, GILD was a specialty practice. (Doc. 128-15 at 82). 
616,20," See also Indeck Energy Servs., Inc. v. Consumers Energy Co., 250 F.3d 972, 977 (6th Cir. 2000) (affirming dismissal when 
""the only harm allegedly suffered by [the plaintiff] was in the company's capacity as a competitor in the marketplace, not as a 
defender of marketplace competition"")."
616,21," The only reason MCEP sold part of its business to KHN was to get access to the payers' managed care networks through the 
KHN contracts with those payers. (Doc. 149-12 at ¶ 13)."
616,22," UHC did not contract with MCEP until: (1) Anthem contracted with MCEP; and (2) UHC was certain they could add MCEP 
without reaching the Panel Limitations. (Doc. 139 at 17-18, 62-63)."
616,23," Humana made an unequivocal commitment not to expand the Dayton network for the 2008 calendar year and did not contract 
MCEP until that commitment expired. (Doc. 139 at 26-27, 63)."
616,24," Cigna requested permission to add MCEP in 2008 and was rejected by Defendants. (Doc. 139 at 27-28, 64)."
616,25," After Aetna expressed interest in July 2007 about contracting with MCEP, Aetna signed a contract with a Panel Limitation 
commencing in 2008 with an additional commitment to keep MCEP out of network. (Doc. 139 at 24-26, 64). After the 2009 KHN 
investment, Aetna signed MCEP, but tried to back out when Defendants warned them that it was a breach of Aetna's agreement 
with Defendants. (Doc. 139 at 26)."
616,26," PHCS tried to negotiate the Panel Limitation out of Defendants' contract for 2008; when unsuccessful, PHCS refused MCEP a 
managed care contract. (Doc. 139 at 29-30, 65)."
616,27," EHN would not contract with MCEP because of the Panel Limitation. When MCEP got access to EHN, thorough the KHN 
Investment, EHN told MCEP that it could not be in network because of its contract with Defendants. (Doc. 139 at 30-31, 65)."
616,28," HealthSpan would not contract with MCEP because of the ""hold the line"" understanding among the big payers, particularly 
Anthem and UHC. However, HealthSpan admits that it is important to match its Hospital Panel to those of the larger payers so 
as to be viewed as a viable alternative to those rivals. (Doc. 128-28 at 189-190)."
616,29," MMO's escape clause permitted them to sign MCEP. MMO, like HealthSpan, concedes that it is important for its network to 
match its rivals. In August 2007, MMO asked about MCEP's contracting status with Anthem. (Doc. 142-28 at 126808). MMO 
explained ""[n]obody else was contracted with Medical Center at Elizabeth Place at that time, so I'm assuming if the largest payor 
in the area [Anthem] is willing to contract with them, then we might be a little more interested in contracting with them, as well."" 
(Doc. 128-14 at 230). "
617,30," Payers acknowledge that all other things being equal, it benefits the payer and their customers from a financial perspective to 
have a procedure performed at the lowest cost facility. (Doc. 128-22 at 205-206; Doc. 128-8 at 310-311; Doc. 128-28 at 193). In 
that regard, Defendant Hospitals were the highest-priced provider in Dayton. "
618,31," Moreover, the Sixth Circuit determined that ""Plaintiff has submitted evidence that each insurer knew that the other insurers 
had included this limitation [negotiating contracts that explicitly exclude the insurers' ability to contract with other parties] in their 
contracts, as demonstrated by the excerpt below from a Dayton industry publication: 'Premier has threatened to revoke 
privileges for physicians participating in [plaintiff hospital] and contracts with health plans such as Anthem and UnitedHealth are 
known to be contingent on excluding [plaintiff hospital] from the network.'"" Med. Ctr. at Elizabeth Place, 817 F.3d at 941."
618,32," MCEP commenced this action on January 30, 2012. (Doc. 7). Consequently, the operative day for the limitations period is 
January 30, 2008. "
619,33," Defendants argue that the Supreme Court does not recognize a discovery rule for Clayton Act claims. See Zenith Radio Corp. 
v. Hazeltine Research Inc., 401 U.S. 321, 91 S. Ct. 795, 28 L. Ed. 2d 77 (1981); Klehr v. A.O. Smith Corp., 521 U.S. 179, 117 S. 
Ct. 1984, 138 L. Ed. 2d 373 (1997). Despite Defendants' argument otherwise, the Court does not interpret either Zenith or Klehr 
to find that the discovery rule does not apply in Clayton Act cases. "
625,34," Defendants do not dispute that the loss of the Dayton Respiratory Group procedures caused MCEP injury—however, 
Defendants contend that Dr. Patel and other physicians resigned for reasons ""that had nothing to do with"" Defendants. The 
Court finds that the circumstances surrounding DRG's departure is disputed, because there is evidence that Dr. Patel divested 
from MCEP as a result of threats to his referrals by Defendants. (Doc. 128-6 at 94-95, 99-100)."
625,35," Larry Weprin and GILD members were losing referrals (Doc. 140 at 107-108), so GILD joined Digestive Care and mutually 
terminated its investment in MCEP in October 2012. (Doc. 128-30 at 245-246; Doc. 146-1 at 7373-77). Dr. Weprin had been a 
part of MCEP since its inception and was excited about the hospital; in fact, he specifically requested a pathology lab to support 
his practice. However, when Dr. Weprin discovered Defendants' hostile sentiments for MCEP, GILD decided to join Digestive 
Care. (Doc. 128-6 at 110-111). GILD physicians admitted that they were told by Defendants that they would ""suffer"" if they sent 
patients to MCEP. As a result, ""[t]he bulk of their group [GILD] was terrified to use anyone that even came close to MCEP from 
the start because of fear of retribution on their referrals."" (Doc. 148-21 at 63; Doc. 128-30 at 223). MCEP argues that GILD's 
departure from MCEP in October 2012 injured MCEP during the limitations period. MCEP's gastroenterology department's 
volume of cases decreased, which resulted in a domino effect on other departments. (Doc. 128-32 at 94-95; Doc. 140 at 59). For 
example, after GILD's departure, Dr. Rosset saw a decrease in her pathologist practice at MCEP by one-half to two-thirds. (Doc. 
128-32 at 63-64). The volume of cases seen by MCEP general surgeons decreased as well. (Doc. 140 at 59; Doc. 128-32 at 
95). This overall decrease in volume lead to a decrease in revenue for MECP. (Doc. 128-32 at 94-95). "
626,36," ""Antitrust law provides that, in the case of a 'continuing violation,"" say a price fixing conspiracy that brings about a series of 
unlawfully high proceed sales over a period of years, 'each overt act that is part of the violation and that injures the plaintiff,' e.g.,

tie its damages to a specific act, but rather that a continuing conspiracy may give rise to ""continually accruing rights of action,"" 
and merely requires a plaintiff to support its allegations that the defendant had committed ""some act"" during the limitations 
period). "
627,38," The Sixth Circuit found a genuine dispute exists as to whether CHI is an entity separate from one or more of the other 
defendants for purposes of Plaintiff's antitrust claim, but the Sixth Circuit did not evaluate the evidence Plaintiff submitted 
regarding CHI's participation in the group boycott. (Doc. 176 at 2)."

627,40," MCEP argues that ""[b]ecause [Premier] is a joint venture, [CHI] must overcome the 'strong presumption'"" that it was an active 
participant. Nunez v. Robin, 415 F. App'x 586, 589 (5th Cir. 2011). However, MCEP misquotes Nunez (a non-antitrust case), 
which actually states that: ""[b]ecause SSA is a joint venture, Nunez must overcome the 'strong presumption' that 'a general 
partnership or joint venture interest is not a security.'"" Id. (considering whether plaintiff's joint venture could hold defendants 
liable under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which depended on whether plaintiff's ownership interest was a security). 
Nunez does not support the proposition that a joint venture is strongly presumed to be a participant in a conspiracy (antitrust or 
otherwise)."

676,1," Joint Defense Motions In Limine Nos. 9 and 15, respectively"
676,2, Joint Defense Motion In Limine No. 10 
679,3," The cases cited by Defendants in support of this assertion are inapposite. In Pierson v. Orlando Reg'l Healthcare Sys., Inc., 
619 F. Supp. 2d 1260, 1274 (M.D. Fla. 2009), the court found the pleading insufficient where plaintiff [*188]  attempted to allege 
two separate violations of the Sherman act in one count. In that case, however, the two separate violations included a violation 
of Section 1 and a violation of Section 2 — distinct claims indeed. Cason-Merenda v. Detroit Med. Center, 862 F. Supp. 2d 603, 
605, 641 (E.D. Mich. 2012) is an example where a plaintiff decided to plead its per se and rule of reason theories separately. 
That case, however, does not stand for the proposition that they must be pleaded separately."
679,4," The doctrine of res ipsa loquitur in negligence is a helpful analogue. That a plaintiff might rely on res ipsa to prove negligence 
does not transform it into something other than a negligence claim."
679,5," Defendants assert the rule of reason and [*190]  per se rule constitute distinct claims because a plaintiff must plead additional 
""elements"" in order make out a rule of reason ""claim"" — specifically, facts that establish a relevant product market, a relevant 
geographic market, and anticompetitive harm. While it is true that a plaintiff must plead such facts in order to make out a Section 
1 claim based on a rule of reason theory, these are not additional elements. The same ""elements"" exist when plaintiffs rely on a 
per se theory; they are just presumed satisfied as a matter of law. "
680,6," On the one hand, a plaintiff is not required to plead its legal theories so long as it satisfies the elements of a Section 1 claim. 
See Edwards, 124 F. App'x at 548. After all, discovery is the appropriate means to determine [*193]  a party's theories, not 
motions to dismiss (let alone motions in limine on the eve of trial). On the other hand, if Sharp had failed to sufficiently plead a 
relevant product market, a relevant geographic market, or anticompetitive harm (an issue on which the Court does not reach), it 
is possible the Court would have dismissed the SAC to the extent it relied on a rule of reason theory."
680,7," Relatedly, Defendants claim that had they known during the motion to dismiss phase that Sharp was going to pursue a rule of 
reason theory, they would have filed a motion to dismiss the SAC for failure to plead sufficient facts to satisfy the Unreasonable 
Restraint Element under a rule of reason analysis. But Defendants did know, or at least they should have known, and their 
failure to take action at the motion to dismiss phase is one reason the Court must deny their motions in limine."
680,8," Certain agreements to restrain trade can be analyzed under the per se rule, the rule of reason, or something in between (often 
called ""quick look"") depending on whether any plausible procompetitive justifications exist. See, e.g., Broadcast Music, Inc. v. 
CBS, 441 U.S. 1, 99 S. Ct. 1551, 60 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1970) (analyzing an agreement that literally fixed prices under the rule of 
reason because of its procompetitive benefits). Plaintiffs in such cases often plead in the alternative by claiming that 
defendants' [*195]  conduct ought to be considered illegal per se, but even if it is not, that it is illegal under the rule of reason. 
Here, Sharp is not arguing that Defendants are liable under the per se rule, or in the alternative, under the rule of reason. They 
are arguing that Defendants are liable under the per se rule as a result of their agreement to fix prices and that they are liable "
681,," under the rule of reason as a result of their agreement to exchange information. Separately, they are alleging that evidence of 
information exchanges is probative of a per se illegal conspiracy to fix prices. "
684,9," The Sharp DAP's objection, see Sharp Reply at 4, 8, on relevance and Rule 403 grounds to Exhibits E, F & G to Defendants' 
opposition brief is OVERRULED. "
703,1," See also DE 194-1 p. 10-11 (""[A]re you offering the opinion that Simon did, in fact, coerce Charming Shoppes not to open a 
store at Heritage Square? A. Well, I believe that's the case. I think that's more of -- much more of an issue for the finder of fact "
704,," for testimony and documents. But it's clear that from -- that Simon was pressuring -- using tying pressure on Charming Shoppes 
and that they didn't go. Whether that's entirely causal, that's a much harder matter. It's very fact bound, and I would say I don't 
have an expert opinion on that."")."
704,2," These opinions are primarily contained in paragraphs 141-67 of Dr. Frech's initial report and paragraphs 34-37 of his 
supplemental report. Simon's motion identified a number of additional paragraphs as being subject to this objection, but many of 
those paragraphs are not mentioned in its brief and are not clearly related to these arguments. Because the report itself will not 
be admitted into evidence, the Court need not parse the report paragraph by paragraph (neither party engages in that sort of 
particularized analysis, either, and even Gumwood [*12]  does not argue as to whether any paragraphs are outside the scope of 
Simon's arguments), but the parties will be expected to conform their examinations at trial to the holdings in this order. "
705,3," It's My Party, 811 F.3d at 685 (""Without coercion—i.e., without requiring the customer to buy product B when buying product 
A—selling products A and B as a unit is simply one strategy for gaining an edge in a free marketplace.""); Paladin Assocs., Inc. v. 
Mont. Power Co., 328 F.3d 1145, 1159 (9th Cir. 2003) (""A plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant went beyond 
persuasion and coerced or forced its customer to buy the tied product in order to obtain the tying product.""); [*16]  Datagate, Inc. 
v. Hewlett-Packard Co., 60 F.3d 1421, 1426 (9th Cir. 1995); Areeda & Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law ¶ 1752b (3d ed. 2011) 
(""There is no tie for any antitrust purpose unless the defendant improperly imposes conditions that explicitly or practically require 
buyers to take the second product if they want the first one.""). "
706,4," See also Collins Inkjet, 781 F.3d at 272 (""In general, the ability of the defendant to impose the threat that creates the 'forcing' 
depends on buyers' not being able to turn elsewhere for the tying product. . . . [I]f the defendant merely offers a discount on the 
tying good to buyers who also purchase the tied good, then buyers are only 'forced' to buy the tied good from the defendant if 
they cannot purchase the tied good elsewhere at a price low enough to offset the forgone discount for the tying product. . . . It 
follows [*19]  that a discount on the tied product amounts to unfair competition only if the defendant is selling below cost.""); 
Cascade Health Solutions v. PeaceHealth, 515 F.3d 883, 910 (9th Cir. 2007) (applying the same analysis to bundled 
discounts as exclusionary practices in monopolization and attempted monopolization claims); Areeda ¶ 1758 (noting that, in 
deciding whether a package discount is coercive, ""we ask whether the discount has the effect of disabling a hypothetical equally 
efficient rival who sells only one of the two products from competing with the bundled price.""); Herbert Hovenkamp, Federal 
Antitrust Policy: The Law of Competition and Its Practice § 10.4c p. 554 (5th ed. 2016) (stating that a package discount can be 
coercive ""if the discount is sufficiently steep in relation to the markup on the second product"" that ""a rival who makes only the 
second product will not be able to compete effectively""); Richard A. Posner, Vertical Restraints and Antitrust Policy, 72 U. Chi. L. 
Rev. 229, 239 (2005) (noting that a loyalty rebate program could not be analyzed as a tying arrangement because no purchaser 
was ""required"" to buy one product as a condition of buying another)."
706,5," At summary judgment, the Court noted that coercion could be accomplished through differential pricing, but it specifically 
cited [*20]  that as a method of coercion that is ""not at issue here."" [DE 178 p. 11 n.2]. "
708,6," Other factors could constrain a firm's ability to exercise market power, too, such as competition in a distinct but interrelated 
market. E.g., Kodak, 504 U.S. at 465-66. "
709,7," Needless to say, it is too late for him to attempt to conduct that analysis now. "
710,8," Dr. Frech identifies a number of shopping centers used as leverage against Ann Taylor, and a number used as leverage 
against Charming Shoppes, but there is no overlap between the two. "
711,9," See also DE 194-1 p. 282 (""[Leverage] includes . . . the ability to impose costs or benefits somewhere else, which is not 
necessarily market power. . . . So even if you don't have market power in the classic normal economic sense, . . . that ability to 
opportunistically impose costs also gives you leverage and can create market power in the tied market."" (emphasis added)), p. 
261 (""The ability to impose [transaction costs] on retailers in Miami gives you market power in Mishawaka or other places 
retailers would like to go."" (emphasis added)), p. 269 (""You can always impose costs on a tenant by not renewing when they're 
expecting to be able to renew. Anybody can do that, and that can be a source of market power somewhere else . . . for anybody, 
in principle."" (emphasis added))."
711,10," Even absent a concession, the result would be the same, as the law does not equate this sort of opportunism with market 
power. Areeda ¶ 1735 (""[D]oes the builder [who opportunistically demands more money to perform a contract] have 'market 
power'? Assuredly not, even though circumstances give the builder a degree [*38]  of 'leverage' over the owner and the power to 
extract a supracompetitive price. . . . Such supracompetitive prices are not customarily described as the kind of 'market power' 
addressed by antitrust law. This exploitation can exist in what is otherwise a perfectly competitive market.""). And to the extent 
Gumwood meant to argue that ex post opportunism is evidence of market power in the tying markets, its argument assumes its 
own conclusion; Gumwood argues that opportunism is evidence of market power because ""Dr. Frech is talking about Simon's 
ability to impose costs in the tying markets, which are the markets where Simon has market power."" [DE 201 p. 12 (emphasis 
omitted)]. "
713,11," See also Areeda ¶ 570b1 (noting that, while hospitals compete locally for patients, they may compete in a national market for 
physicians: ""The market is national if hospitals engage such specialists from around the nation, if new physicians see their 
opportunities as national, and if even established doctors often relocate.""). "
719,1," For ease of reference, this opinion refers to Provider Plaintiffs as ""Plaintiffs."" [*19] "
720,2," Importantly, the court notes that both NASCO and CHP have explicitly refrained from addressing whether Plaintiffs have shown 
anticompetitive conduct by the other Defendants. (Doc. # 658, Brief in Support of NASCO's and CHP's Motion for Summary 
Judgment at 14 n. 6)."
720,3," The facts set out in this opinion are gleaned from the parties' submissions of facts claimed to be undisputed, [*20]  their 
respective responses to those submissions, and the court's own examination of the evidentiary record. All reasonable doubts 
about the facts have been resolved in favor of the nonmoving party. See Info Sys. & Networks Corp. v. City of Atlanta, 281 F.3d 
1220, 1224 (11th Cir. 2002). These are the ""facts"" for summary judgment purposes only. They may not be the actual facts that 
could be established through live testimony at trial. See Cox v. Admr. U.S. Steel & Carnegie Pension Fund, 17 F.3d 1386, 1400 
(11th Cir. 1994). "
721,4," A Control Plan is a Blue Plan that controls the geographic area in which a national account is headquartered and enjoys a 
contractual relationship with that national account. (See Doc. # 658, Ex. 1 at 59; Ex. 4 at 40)."
721,5," According to CHP's Chief Executive Officer, the BCBSA defines a national account as ""any account with members 
headquartered in one service area, members outside a service area, and two hundred fifty or more"" members or employees. 
(Doc. # 658, Ex. 5 at 48-49). "
722,6," A representative for NASCO stated that it integrates BlueCard software into its claims processing system because all Blue 
Plans are required to support the BlueCard system, and NASCO's integration of the software eliminates the need of its members 
""to do that development work in-house."" (Doc. # 658, Ex. 1 at 96)."
722,7," Blue, or BlueSquared, is a web application developed by BCBSA that facilitates claims processing [*27]  between Blue Plans. 
BCBSA requires Blue Plans to use Blue, but they are free to use it inside or outside of NASCO's system. (Doc. # 658, Ex. 1 at 
247-48). "
725,8," NASCO and CHP argue that any claim against them under Section 2 of the Sherman Act fails because: (1) Plaintiffs have not 
claimed that NASCO or CHP engaged in independent conduct that violated Section 2; and (2) Plaintiffs cannot show that 
NASCO or CHP are capable of concerted conduct with the Blue Plans and the BCBSA or that they consciously committed to a 
conspiracy to monopsonize healthcare provider markets. (Doc. # 658, Brief in Support of NASCO's and CHP's Motion for 
Summary Judgment at 15 n. 7). Regarding the Section 2 claims, the court concludes that Plaintiffs' monopsonization claim 
(Count IX of the Consolidated Second Amended Provider Complaint) does not include as its targets either NASCO or CHP 
because Count IX limits the Defendants targeted to ""ones identified as a having a market share of 40% or more in at least one 
geographic area."" (Doc. # 236 ¶ 443). Obviously, NASCO and CHP do not fall within that definition. Moreover, Plaintiffs' 
monopsonization conspiracy claim against NASCO and CHP (Count [*38]  X of the operative Provider Complaint) fails because 
they have not pointed to any admissible evidence that NASCO or CHP deliberately entered into a conspiracy ""with the specific 
intent of achieving a [monopsony]."" Levine v. Central Florida Medical Affiliates, Inc., 72 F.3d 1538, 1556 (11th Cir. 1996) 
(including specific intent to achieve a monopoly as an element of a Section 2 conspiracy claim). "
729,9," Likewise, CHP's involvement in hard steerage does not alter its primary role as a conduit of information between Blue Plans 
and insurance purchasers. Notably, there is no indication in the Rule 56 record that CHP is involved with negotiations between 
Blue Plans and medical providers, even if it can be said that it is involved in negotiations between Blue Plans and insurance 
purchasers."
729,10," NASCO and CHP differ somewhat from the pawns described in Siegel Transfer and Pink Supply because their income derives 
from fees for various services, rather than a contingency payment for total income or total sales obtained by the principal. See 
Siegel Transfer, 54 F.3d at 1135; Pink Supply, 788 F.2d at 1316-17. Nevertheless, their economic interests are sufficiently 
congruent with their owners' interests that they do not have a separate economic consciousness. Moreover, the Seventh Circuit 
has recognized that a single firm can contain competing financial interests without being subject to scrutiny under Section 1 of 
the Sherman Act. See Chicago Professional Sports Ltd. Partnership v. National Basketball Assn., 95 F.3d 593, 598 (7th Cir. 
1996) (discussing potential financial conflicts between different divisions in a company or partners in a [*53]  professional firm). "
735,1, The Court's holding is explained in greater detail in Docket Nos. 254 at 12; 214 at 27-33.
735,2, Plaintiffs do not contend that the alleged conspiracy in this case is a price fixing conspiracy. 
745,1," GE asserted claims against the Whirlpool Defendants but those claims have been settled. GE also asserts claims [*4]  against 
the ACC Defendants and GE has a default judgment as to liability against ACC. "
747,2," In addition to their supplemental brief, the Danfoss Defendants filed two exhibits that GE filed objections to: 1) a ""MABE 
Offering Memorandum"" (Docket Entry No. 542-9); and 2) a Declaration from Mauricio Serralde Rodriguez, with Exhibits B-C to 
the Declaration (Docket Entry No. 541-10). The Danfoss Defendants responded to those objections. (Docket Entry No. 549). But 
because the Court's analysis does not consider those items, the Court need not address those objections. "
748,3," Under Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 746, 97 S. Ct. 2061, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1977), only direct purchasers of an 
allegedly price-fixed product may pursue private actions for monetary damages under federal antitrust laws."
748,4," The initial decision in the case, Motorola Mobility LLC v. Au Optronics Corp., 746 F.3d 842 (7th Cir. 2014), was issued without 
oral argument and without the panel having heard from other interested parties. "
749,5," The Seventh Circuit [*17]  rejected Motorola's ""target theory"" as to antitrust liability. See, e.g., Motorola, 775 F.3d at at 822 
(""Motorola's 'target' theory of antitrust liability would nullify the doctrine of Illinois Brick.""). Moreover, in this case the plaintiff's 
target theory is even weaker because GE has not made any specific allegations that any Danfoss entity targeted GE or MABE or 
sold compressors to MABE during the time of the alleged conspiracy. (See Def.'s Br., D.E. No. 542, at 8). "
752,6," GE abandoned its prior assertion that the ""cost-plus"" exception applies. "
753,7," Moreover, to the extent that GE asserts that it needs discovery on this issue, the Court disagrees. This is especially so given 
that all of the relevant evidence as to relationship between GE and MABE is in GE's hands already. It would not get such 
discovery from the Danfoss Defendants. "
813,1, The CPI is a measure of inflation.
813,2," See, e.g., Knoll, Michael S. and Colon, Jeffrey M., ""The Calculation of Prejudgment Interest"" (2005). Scholarship at Penn Law. 
Paper 120 (describing different ways to calculate prejudgment interest and arguing that prejudgment interest ought to be 
computed using the defendant's unsecured borrowing rate)."
813,3, Real interest rates are calculated by taking the nominal rate and subtracting the inflation rate.
813,4," DAPs' ""competitive intelligence practices"" appear to [*220]  include both (1) the unilateral monitoring of publicly-available 
information on price and other competitive data, and (2) the exchange of nonpublic information with competitors. "
814,5," The DAPs' argument applies both to the argument that the DAPs' vendors did not pass on the entire overcharge to the DAPs 
(upstream pass-on) and that the DAPs passed on the entire overcharge to their customers (downstream pass-on)."
814,6," Defendants also argue pass-on defenses are relevant to Best Buys' state law claims under Minnesota law. Best Buy, however, 
has since settled those claims. "
815,7," Nor is the jury likely to be confused by ""improperly conflat[ing] DAPs' legal competitor contacts with Defendants' illegal ones."" 
Mot. #1. Information exchanges are not per se illegal. See United States v. U.S. Gypsum Co., 438 U.S. 422, 443, 98 S. Ct. 2864, 
57 L. Ed. 2d 854 (1978). If anything, therefore, the introduction of evidence showing how such exchanges can be for legitimate 
purposes will help the jury avoid making improper assumptions and help them determine whether the exchanges at issue are 
similar to legitimate exchanges or probative of something more nefarious. "
816,8," The Court rejects Defendants' argument that reference to trebled damages under the Clayton Act should be allowed because [i]n addition to showing potential bias, the availability of de-trebled damages under ACPERA may be relevant at trial to 
show that Chunghwa could have been motivated to enter into a leniency agreement with the DOJ by a desire to reduce its 
future civil liability [*230]  risk and not, as Plaintiffs will likely argue, because Chunghwa believed it had committed a 
violation of U.S. antitrust laws. Opp'n at 27. Defendants are free to argue that Chunghwa could have been motivated to enter into a leniency agreement by a 
desire to reduce its future civil liability, but they are precluded from making that point by referencing the fact that the DAPs' 
damages will be trebled. "
817,9," The Court recognizes that whether the DAPs passed on some of the overcharge to their customers may be relevant to the 
calculation of damages under certain state law claims. The fact that the consumers to whom the DAPs passed on some of those 
overcharges also brought suit against Defendants, however, is irrelevant. "

] Market power has been defined as the power ""to force a purchaser to do something that he would not do in a

834,4," Although not raised by either party, the Court acknowledges that it has previously concluded in Pro-Tech Energy Solutions, 
LLC v. Cooper, 2015 NCBC LEXIS 76 (N.C. Super. Ct. July 30, 2015), that the plural term ""Managers,"" as used in the LLC 
operating agreement at issue in that case, did not include the singular term ""Manager"" as a matter of law, id. at *18, which might 
appear in conflict with the Court's conclusion here. In the Pro-Tech case, however, the singular form ""Manager"" and the plural 
form ""Managers"" were each used elsewhere in the Operating Agreement, which [*32]  strongly supported the interpretation that 
""Managers"" and ""Manager"" were intended to have different meanings. In the licensing agreements at issue here, however, there 
is no use of the singular form ""vendor""—only the plural form ""vendors""—which, as used here, plainly suggests that the term 
""vendors"" was not intended to exclude Window World's approval of only a single vendor. "
872,1," If the volume of statements sought to be admitted exceeds the Court's capacity to analyze them before the next trial day

seeking to admit that volume of statements, they are advised to seek a ruling pre-trial."
872,2," ""Umbrella damages"" refer to injuries caused by a price-fixing conspiracy but suffered as a result of purchases made from 
suppliers outside of the cartel. See Philip E. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law: An Analysis of Antitrust Principles 
and Their Application ¶ 347 (4th ed. 2014). "
873,3," Defendants' motion includes a quote taken out of context from Broad. Music, Inc. v. Columbia Broad. Sys., Inc., 441 U.S. 1, 23, 
99 S. Ct. 1551, 60 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1979) (""BMI""). Price-Ladder Mot. at 2 (""The Supreme Court has made clear that '[n]ot in all 
arrangements among actual or potential competitors that have an impact on price are per se violations of the Sherman Act or 
even unreasonable restraints.'""). BMI, however, addressed when an agreement is illegal per se versus when it ought to be 
evaluated under the rule of reason. If Defendants are arguing that the DAPs' claims related to purchases of Larger-Sized CRTs 
ought to be evaluated under the rule of reason, their argument fails. The DAPs are alleging an agreement to fix prices. That is 
sufficient to trigger the per se rule. The question here is whether they can claim as damages overcharges from Larger-Sized 
CRTs. That question turns on whether the DAPs have standing to assert those claims and whether the alleged overcharges from 
Larger-Sized CRTs were the direct and proximate result of the unlawful acts of the defendant. Atl. Richfield Co. v. USA 
Petroleum Co., 495 U.S. 328, 334-46, 110 S. Ct. 1884, 109 L. Ed. 2d 333 (1990)."
873,4," Alternatively, if Defendants believed there was no genuine dispute of material fact on this issue, they should have filed a motion 
for summary judgment. "
874,5," Specifically, such injuries occur because cartels increase prices by reducing output. This reduction in market supply causes the 
market price of the price-fixed good to increase, including potentially the price charged by non-conspiring suppliers. It follows 
that consumers who purchase price-fixed goods from non-conspiring suppliers are likely to be injured, at least to some extent, 
even though the price of the specific good purchased was at no point ""set"" by a conspirator pursuant to an agreement to fix 
prices."
874,6," The Third Circuit, however, came to the opposite conclusion in a later case. See In re Lower Lake Erie Iron Ore Antitrust Litig., 
998 F.2d at 1168. "
876,7," The five factors include ""(1) . . . whether [the alleged injury is] the type the antitrust laws were intended to forestall; (2) the 
directness of the injury; (3) the speculative measure of the harm; (4) the risk of duplicative recovery; and (5) the complexity in 
apportioning damages."" Garabet, 116 F. Supp. 2d at 1166 (quoting Am. Ad Mgmt. v. Gen. Tel. Co. of California, 190 F.3d 1051, 
1054 (9th Cir. 1999)."
876,8," Specifically, in response to an increase in price from conspirators, consumer demand for an innocent supplier's goods is likely 
to increase, shifting the innocent supplier's demand curve to the right, thereby causing an increase in price. Further, a reduction 
in market supply is likely to cause the aggregate supply curve to shift to the left, thereby causing an increase in the price set by 
all suppliers. Finally, if the cartel results in significant market concentration, an innocent supplier is likely be able to increase its 
profit margins by increasing price above marginal cost or by engaging in parallel pricing. All of these ""pricing decisions,"" 
however, are precipitated by the conspiracy and are not unique to innocent suppliers; indeed, they are the means by which 
conspirators drive their own prices higher. The main substantive difference between conspiring and non-conspiring suppliers, 
therefore, is that non-conspiring suppliers do not participate in the conduct that sets these forces in motion. Since umbrella 
damages do not seek to hold innocent suppliers liable, however, that is a distinction without a difference."
876,9," HN7[
] Damages are usually the difference between the price paid and the competitive price. The price paid is almost always 
clear. To determine the competitive price, however, one has to control for unrelated forces, such as those the Garabet court 
cites, regardless of the party from whom the plaintiff purchased the price-fixed good. Although such calculations may be 
inherently imprecise, they are not impermissibly speculative. See J. Truett Payne Co. v. Chrysler Motors Corp., 451 U.S. 557, 
566, 101 S. Ct. 1923, 68 L. Ed. 2d 442 (1981) (""The vagaries of the marketplace usually deny us sure knowledge of what 
plaintiff's situation would have been in the absence of the defendant's antitrust violation.""); Bigelow v. RKO Radio Pictures, Inc., 
327 U.S. 251, 264, 66 S. Ct. 574, 90 L. Ed. 652 (1946) (""The tortious acts had in each case precluded ascertainment of the 
amount of damages more precisely . . . . Nevertheless, we held that the jury could return a verdict for the plaintiffs.""); Story 
Parchment Co. v. Paterson Parchment Paper Co., 282 U.S. 555, 562, 51 S. Ct. 248, 75 L. Ed. 544 (1931) (""The most 
elementary conceptions of justice and public policy require that the wrongdoer shall bear the risk of the uncertainty which his 
own wrong has created.""). "
878,10," DAP Sharp did not join the instant motion because it alleges both a per se violation as a result of an agreement to fix prices 
and a violation under the rule of reason as a result of an agreement to exchange information. Whether Defendants are liable 
under the rule of reason depends on whether the procompetitive benefits of the alleged information exchanges outweigh the 
anticompetitive harm."
878,11," The DAPs' Rule 403 objection is denied without prejudice. The DAPs are free to object at trial if they believe the probative 
value is substantially outweighed by unfair prejudice or if the evidence is cumulative. The Court will make a Rule 403 
determination at that time based on the context and circumstances in which the evidence is submitted. "
883,1," The following facts are drawn from Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint and the exhibits attached thereto. See Mayer v. Belichick, 
605 F.3d 223, 230 (3d Cir. 2010) (""In deciding a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a court must consider only the complaint, exhibits 
attached to the complaint, matters of public record, [and] undisputedly authentic documents if the complaint's claims are based 
upon these documents."")."
883,2," Medallions are required for all Philadelphia cabs. Under 53 Pa. C.S.A. § 5712, a medallion ""provide[s] holders of certificates of 
public convenience . . . the opportunity to upgrade and improve the operations of taxicabs."""
883,3," There are two types of certificates: one for ""partial rights cabs"" and another for medallion [**5]  cabs. Where partial rights cabs 
are only authorized to provide services in specified parts of the city or under certain restrictions, Medallion cabs may generally 
transport people throughout Philadelphia."
883,4," Rather than a minimum wage, a certificate holder may choose to charge no more than prevailing maximum lease rate to cab 
drivers. "
884,5," Medallions are treated as property—e.g., medallions can be pledged as security to creditors and cannot be revoked or 
cancelled by the PPA—and Plaintiffs assert medallions have been instrumental in improving the taxi service and increasing 
ridership, profitability. In turn, the value of a medallion has climbed; specifically, in 2005, when the PPA implemented the 
medallion system, the value of a medallion was $65,000, and in 2014, the value jumped to $530,000. "
886,6," The scope of a common law claim of ""unfair competition is coextensive with Restatement (Third) of unfair competition."" 
Giordano, 714 F. Supp. 2d at 521-22 (collecting cases). The Restatement (Third) of Unfair Competition provides One who causes harm to the commercial relations of another by engaging in a business or trade is not subject to 
liability [**14]  to the other for such harm unless: (a) the harm results from acts or practices of the actor actionable by the other under the rules of this Restatement 
relating to: (1) deceptive marketing, as specified in Chapter Two; (2) infringement of trademarks and other indicia of identification, as specified in Chapter Three; (3) appropriation of intangible trade values including trade secrets and the right of publicity, as specified in 
Chapter Four; or from other acts or practices of the actor determined to be actionable as an unfair method of competition, taking into 
account the nature of the conduct and its likely effect on both the person seeking relief and the public . . . . Restatement (Third) of Unfair Competition § 1."
886,7," While Plaintiffs do not bring a Lanham Act here, courts in this District have uniformly found that a ""Pennsylvania common law 
cause for unfair competition is identical to the Lanham Act, without the federal requirement of interstate commerce."" R.J. Ants, 
Inc. v. Marinelli Enters., LLC, 771 F. Supp. 2d 475, 489 (E.D. Pa. 2011); see also Regal Indus., Inc., v. Genal Strap, Inc., No. 93-
209, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10193, 1994 WL 388686, at *2 (E.D. Pa. July 26, 1994) (""The elements of common law unfair 
competition in [**16]  Pennsylvania are identical to those necessary to make out a claim under the Lanham Act, except that the "
887,," Lanham Act requires interstate commerce.""). As such, in analyzing Plaintiffs' unfair competition claim, the Court is guided by 
case law treatment of the Lanham Act."
887,8," It cannot be seriously disputed whether the three other elements for privilege exist here. This action centers on Uber's 
competition with Plaintiffs, satisfying the first element. As to the third element, just as the Court found Plaintiffs do not have 
antitrust standing, it likewise finds Uber's recruitment did not create or continue an unlawful restraint of trade. As to the last 
element, Uber, in recruiting drivers, seeks to advance its own interest by staffing its operations in Philadelphia, which Plaintiff 
pleads is in high demand. "
890,1," The Court refers to Comcast and Comcast Spotlight collectively as ""Defendants."""
890,2," The facts presented in the Background are taken from the complaint and are presumed true for the purpose of resolving the 
pending motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6). See Teamsters Local Union No. 705 v. Burlington N. Santa Fe, LLC, 741 F.3d 
819, 823 (7th Cir. 2014); Alam v. Miller Brewing Co., 709 F.3d 662, 665-66 (7th Cir. 2013); see also Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 
550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007). "
894,3," Defendants argue that Viamedia's ""NCC claim is not ripe."" (R. 23, Mem. Supp. Defs.' Mot. Dismiss, at 12.) Viamedia disavows 
that it has a separate NCC claim; instead, Viamedia says its allegations concerning NCC are ""indicative of Comcast's pattern of 
conduct"" and ""part of its overall course of anticompetitive conduct."" (R. 28 at 15.) Because Viamedia alleges that Comcast 
""intends"" to close access to NCC in the future but has not yet done so, the Court will focus on Viamedia's allegations regarding 
the Interconnects. Nevertheless, because Comcast's conduct with respect to NCC mirrors its conduct with respect to the 
Interconnects, the Court's analysis of Comcast's conduct associated with the Interconnects would apply to Comcast's possible 
future conduct associated with NCC. "
897,4," Because the Court concludes that the contract is not central to Viamedia's allegations, the Court also rejects Defendants' 
argument that it should consider the contract because Viamedia strategically avoided including the contract in its complaint and 
""courts consistently reject such artful pleading efforts."" (R. 29, Defs.' Reply, at 2.) Moreover, the Court disagrees that Viamedia 
engaged in this sort of ""artful pleading"" given Viamedia's claims in this case."
897,5," Defendants argue that Viamedia also has a claim based on a monopoly-leveraging theory. Viamedia, however, denies this. The 
Court discusses this argument in Section II.C.2."
897,6," Defendants contend that they ""expressly argued that the Complaint does not establish that [they] acted with anticompetitive 
intent."" (R. 29 at 3 n.3 (citing R. 23 at 10).) Defendants are referring to a passage of their brief in which they argue that they 
engaged in procompetitive conduct rather than an illegal refusal to deal, and therefore their actions are not evidence of 
anticompetitive intent. It thus appears that Defendants' arguments regarding intent are intertwined with their arguments 
regarding [**28]  a lack of anticompetitive conduct. The Court therefore will consider and resolve those arguments together. See 
Spectrum Sports, Inc. v. McQuillan, 506 U.S. 447, 459, 113 S. Ct. 884, 122 L. Ed. 2d 247 (1993) (explaining that anticompetitive 
conduct ""may be sufficient to prove the necessary intent to monopolize""); Lenox MacLaren Surgical Corp. v. Medtronic, Inc., 762 "
898,," F.3d 1114, 1130 (10th Cir. 2014) (""We have elsewhere concluded that the fact-finder could reasonably infer monopoly power 
and exclusionary conduct. With these inferences, the jury could also find an intent to monopolize.""); M & M Med. Supplies & 
Serv., Inc. v. Pleasant Valley Hosp., Inc., 981 F.2d 160, 166 (4th Cir. 1992) (""Specific intent may be inferred from the 
defendant's anticompetitive practices.""); see also Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., 472 U.S. 585, 603, 105 S. 
Ct. 2847, 86 L. Ed. 2d 467 (1985) (""Improper exclusion (exclusion not the result of superior efficiency) is always deliberately 
intended."" (quoting Robert Bork, The Antitrust Paradox 160 (1978))); 2-16 Earl W. Kinter et al., Federal Antitrust Law § 16.17 
(2015) (""[I]n both monopolization and attempted monopolization cases, courts typically infer intent from the character of the 
practice.""). "
899,7," Other portions of Viamedia's complaint also reference its tying and exclusive dealing claims. (See, e.g., R. 1 at ¶ 2 (""Comcast 
has used its unilateral power to admit or [**32]  deny competing cable television companies access to this infrastructure and 
condition access to this infrastructure upon those companies' exclusive use of Comcast Spotlight as their Spot Cable Advertising 
Representative. Comcast has also banned any competing company that wishes to access this infrastructure from doing 
business with Viamedia.""); id. at ¶ 95 (explaining that Comcast has used its power over the Interconnects to ""forc[e] [MVPDs] to 
accept representation agreements with Comcast Spotlight""); id. at ¶ 153 (""Comcast's conditioning of access to the Interconnects 
and NCC on its rival MVPDs entering into exclusive dealing arrangements with Comcast Spotlight . . . is an anticompetitive 
means of acquiring and maintaining monopoly power in the market for Spot Cable Advertising Representation.""). "
900,8," Defendants present a brief argument in a footnote that Viamedia lacks antitrust standing because it cannot assert claims based 
on alleged harm to MVPDs. (R. 23 at 13 n.7.) Such cursory arguments are deemed waived. See Harmon v. Gordon, 712 F.3d 
1044, 1053 (7th Cir. 2013); Long v. Teachers' Ret. Sys. of Ill., 585 F.3d 344, 349 (7th Cir. 2009); Keith v. Ferring Pharma., Inc., 
No. 15 FC 10381, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 131808, 2016 WL 5391224, at *13 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 27, 2016); see also Hammes v. 
AAMCO Transmissions, Inc., 33 F.3d 774, 778 (7th Cir. 1994) (""[D]espite the suggestive terminology, 'antitrust standing' is not a 
jurisdictional requirement and is therefore waivable.""); ChampionsWorld, LLC v. U.S. Soccer Fed'n, 890 F. Supp. 2d 912, 924 
(N.D. Ill. 2012). Moreover, while MVPDs are harmed by Comcast's alleged conduct, so is Viamedia based on its exclusion from "
901,," the market. Both consumers and competitors may have standing [**38]  to enforce the antitrust laws. See Illinois ex rel. Ryan v. 
Brown, 227 F.3d 1042, 1046 (7th Cir. 2000) (explaining that ""normally only consumers or competitors have [antitrust] standing""); 
Areeda, supra, at ¶ 339d (""The mere fact that an antitrust violation produces two different classes of victims hardly entails that 
their victories are duplicative of one another. For example, successful predatory pricing, exclusive dealing, or similar 
exclusionary practices injure rivals by destroying their profits or their business; it ultimately injures consumers as well through 
higher product prices. There is no sense in which the lost-profit injury incurred by the competitors 'duplicates' that incurred by 
consumers, and awarding damages to one interest does nothing to make the other interest whole.""). Defendants also argue that there is no antitrust injury because ""there is simply no reason to infer that Comcast's decision to 
replace an intermediary with a direct relationship with MVPDs has an anticompetitive motive or effect."" (R. 23 at 14.) ""Such 
disintermediation,"" Defendants say, ""is a 'prototypical valid business purpose.'"" (Id. (quoting Port Dock & Stone Corp. v. 
Oldcastle Ne., Inc., 507 F.3d 117, 124 (2d Cir. 2007).) This argument fails. First, the Court has already found that Viamedia has alleged antitrust injury based on Defendants' 
exclusion [**39]  of competition and the diminished quality of spot cable advertising representation in a market in which Comcast 
Spotlight is the only option. Second, the cases Defendants cite deal with manufacturers vertically expanding to distribute their 
own product. (Id. at 14 & n.8); see Port Dock, 507 F.3d at 124; Jack Walters & Sons Corp v. Morton Bldg., Inc., 737 F.2d 698, 
710 (7th Cir. 1984); Institutional Foods Packing, Inc. v. Creative Prods., Inc., No. 89 C 4499, 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6660, 1992 
WL 111133, at *3 (N.D. Ill. May 12, 1992). That sort of cutting out of a middleman ""usually is procompetitive."" Jack Walters, 737 
F.2d at 710. It is for this reason, as explained further below, that Viamedia fails to state a claim based on Defendants' refusal to 
deal with Viamedia. Nevertheless, at this stage of the litigation, Viamedia has adequately alleged that Defendants tying and 
exclusive dealing arrangements have done more than merely eliminate a middleman in the provision of Interconnect services. 
Instead, Viamedia has alleged these arrangements have entirely foreclosed competition in the market for advertising 
representation even for ad sales that do not involve an Interconnect. For these reasons, Viamedia has sufficiently pled antitrust 
injury. "
907,9," At times it appears that Viamedia's refusal to deal claim also turns on Comcast refusing to provide Interconnect services to 
MVPDs. This refusal, however, is simply part of the tying claim. Indeed, Comcast has now provided WOW and RCN with access 
to the Interconnects at issue. The potential problem with Comcast's conduct, however, is that it provided this access only after 
allegedly coercing the MVPDs to accept Comcast [**59]  Spotlight's services."
907,10," Viamedia also alleges various claims under state antitrust law as well as a state law claim for tortious interference with a 
business expectancy. (R. 1 at ¶¶ 183-223.) Comcast contends that there are ""no relevant differences between Viamedia's state 
and federal antitrust claims."" (R. 23 at 15.) The Court accordingly treats those claims [**60]  just as it treats Viamedia's claims 
under the Sherman Act. Comcast also argues that the Court should ""relinquish supplemental jurisdiction over any remaining 
state law claims"" if the Court dismisses the federal antitrust claims. (Id.) Because the Court does not dismiss the federal claims, 
it maintains supplemental jurisdiction. "
917,1," Defendants U.S. Bank Trust, N.A. as Trustee for LSF9 Master Participation Trust (""U.S. Bank Trust as Trustee of LSF9"") and 
MTC Financial, Inc. have been served, (Dkt. No. 1 at 46), but have not appeared in the case. "
918,2," The Court notes that Plaintiffs have mistakenly read that Assignment 1 was recorded four days after the Substitution of 
Trustee; the SAC asserts that the Substitution of Trustee was recorded two years after Assignment 1 was recorded. (See Dkt. 
No. 26-4, BANA's RJN, Ex. 2; Dkt. No. 27-2, Caliber's RJN, Ex. C.) "
919,3," BANA and Caliber do not move to dismiss the negligence cause of action which the Court previously found stated a claim in 
the Court's prior order on Defendants' motions to dismiss. (Dkt. No. 23.) "
920,4," ""The court may judicially notice a fact that is not subject to reasonable dispute because it: (1) is generally known within the trial 
court's territorial jurisdiction; or (2) can be accurately and readily determined [*11]  from sources whose accuracy cannot 
reasonably be questioned."" Fed. R. Evid. 201. "
921,5," While Plaintiffs allege a fourth RFI was sent to Caliber in December 2015, the SAC does not state what information that letter 
sought. (Dkt. No. 25, SAC ¶ 118.)"
921,6," ""Congress gave the Department of Housing and Urban Development (""HUD"") authority to regulate under RESPA, and HUD 
promulgated the corresponding regulations known as Regulation X. The Dodd—Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer 
Protection Act transferred the regulatory authority of RESPA from HUD to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (""CFPB""), 
and CFPB later republished Regulation X without material changes."" Edwards v. First American Corp., 798 F.3d 1172, 1179 (9th 
Cir. 2015) (concerning anti-kickback [*16]  provision of RESPA). "
923,7, The pages numbers are based on the CM/ECF pagination. 
925,8," Caliber does not move to dismiss the third RFI since the Court previously denied its motion to dismiss on this claim. 
Therefore, [*29]  that claim remains. While the SAC also alleges a fourth RFI as to Caliber, it does not move to dismiss the 
fourth RFI. (Dkt. No. 25, SAC ¶ 118.) "
926,9," Caliber does not move to dismiss the allegation that it failed to timely acknowledge the first RFI within five business days. (Dkt. 
No. 25, SAC ¶ 79.) In the Court's prior order, it denied Caliber's motion to dismiss for violation of 12 C.F.R. § 1024.36(c)."
926,10," In a footnote, Caliber contends that 12 C.F.R. § 1024.36 does not require a servicer to respond to any request that is the same 
as previously requested and complied with. Caliber argues that it previously provided information about the owner and investor 
when it sent Plaintiffs copies of the assignment of the deed of trust. However, the Court notes that even if Caliber is exempt from 
providing duplicative information, HN17[
] the regulations require the servicer to notify the borrower of this determination in writing no later than five days after making such determination. See 12 C.F.R. § 1024.36(f). Moreover, at this stage of the 
proceeding, the Court declines to consider, without proper evidence, that the response to RFI 2 was duplicative of a response to 
a prior RFI. "
927,11," In contrast, the SAC also alleges that as to the second RFI sent to Caliber, Plaintiffs allege that the documents they received 
were not responsive to Plaintiffs' requests. (Dkt. No. 25, SAC ¶ 115.) While this allegation [*34]  is not sufficient to state a claim 
under Regulation X of RESPA, the allegation in paragraph 82 stating that Plaintiffs were not provided with the information about 
the owner of the loan is sufficient to state a claim. "
928,12," The quiet title claim is also alleged as to U.S. Bank Trust as Trustee for LSF9; however, that entity has not yet appeared in the 
case. "
929,13," U.S. Bank also argues that to the extent the allegations relate to an assignment made in violation of a PSA (Pooling Servicing 
Agreement) such defects render the assignment voidable under New York [*41]  Law, and not void; and therefore Plaintiffs lack 
standing to challenge any defects in Assignment 3. However, the SAC does not allege that DOT 2 was subject to a PSA. 
Therefore, this argument is without merit. "
932,14," While Plaintiffs allege cancellation of DOT 1 and DOT 2, they do not provide any arguments why these documents should be 
cancelled."
932,15," The Court notes that while Plaintiffs allege cancellation of instrument on Assignment 1, (Dkt. No. 25, SAC ¶ 181), it appears 
they seek cancellation of instrument on Assignments 2 and 3 only as they only reference the dates recorded of these two 
assignments. (Id.) In the prior order on motions to dismiss, the Court directed Plaintiffs to clarify which Assignment they 
challenge; however, they failed to do so. Therefore, the Court assumes Plaintiffs are alleging cancellation of instrument as to 
Assignments 2 and 3."
932,16," Plaintiffs also argue that DOT 1 is not valid because the SAC shows that the note relating to DOT 1, serviced by Caliber, was 
never transferred or assigned to U.S. Bank; therefore, DOT 1 securing the debt does not secure any debt and Caliber and MTC "
933,," do not have the right to initiate non-judicial foreclosure proceedings. (Dkt. No. 29 at 13; Dkt. No. 30 at 12.) However, the SAC 
asserts no allegations concerning the transfer of the note. Therefore, this argument is without merit. "
938,17," Plaintiffs add a sentence to assert an additional injury-in-fact, ""the ongoing delay with respect to the state of artificial default 
has caused the Principal balance due under the loan secured by DOT 1 to increase, reducing Plaintiffs' equity interest in the 
Subject Property."" (Dkt. No. 25, SAC ¶ 160.) However, the Court has already held that loss of equity, as it is already alleged in 
paragraph 159, sufficiently alleges an injury-in-fact. "
939,18," As stated earlier, the Court dismisses the Regulation Z allegations. "
942,1," Defendants IASIS Healthcare LLC (""IASIS""), Health Choice of Arizona, [*3]  Inc. (""Health Choice""), Health Choice Management 
Co. (""HCMC""), Physician Group of Arizona (""PGA""), St. Luke's Behavioral Hospital, L.P. (""SLBH""), St. Luke's Medical Center 
L.P. (""SLMC""), Mountain Vista Medical Center, L.P. (""Mountain Vista""), and Heritage Technologies, LLC (collectively, the 
""Moving Defendants"")."
942,2," Aaron Fisher, Risa Cohen, John Gutzwiller, Deborah Hartman, Cynthia Limon, and Catherine Nowak (collectively, ""Relators"")."
942,3," Northern Arizona Dermatology Center P.C., North Country Healthcare Inc., MOMDOC LLC, and Genesis OB/GYN, P.C. (which 
filed an additional Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 90) which also joins in the Moving Defendants' Motion) (collectively, ""Joining 
Defendants""). "
953,4," Moving Defendants argue in a footnote that Relators mischaracterize the third element of an FCA claim—scienter—but do not 
address the requirement further, other than to say that their qualifying statements of personal knowledge in certifications rule out 
scienter. u(Mot. at 33 n.31.) Although the FCA's scienter requirement is ""rigorous,"" Relators' allegations satisfy it here. The FCA "
954,," itself provides that ""no proof of specific intent to defraud"" is required to satisfy the scienter requirement. 31 U.S.C. § 
3729(b)(1)(B). See, e.g., Castillo—Villagra v. INS, 972 F.2d 1017, 1026 (9th Cir. 1992). In short, ""[s]o long as the statement in 
question is knowingly false when made, it matters not whether it is a certification, assertion, [*45]  statement, or secret 
handshake; False Claims liability can attach."" Hendow, 461 F.3d at 1172. Relators' claims regarding false certifications are rife 
with allegations of reckless disregard as to the truth or falsity of compliance requirements and deliberate ignorance to those 
attestations. Further, Moving Defendants cannot escape liability by deliberately failing to investigate any claims. Nor can they 
escape liability for not applying standard criteria or by failing to review whatsoever. Such conduct cannot serve to preclude 
Relators from satisfying the scienter standard. "
956,5," In a separate Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 90), Defendant Genesis OB/GYN, P.C. join in Moving Defendants' Motion, and made 
similar, non-separate arguments for dismissal regarding Rule 9(b) particularity, so the Court considered their arguments together 
with those of Moving Defendants. "
961,1," GSK filed its motion to dismiss on October 11, 2013. While the motion was pending, the Third Circuit agreed to hear an 
interlocutory appeal in another case raising a similar issue regarding RICO standing. See In re Avandia Marketing, Sales 
Practices & Products Liability Litigation, No. 10-5419, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 152726, 2013 WL 5761202 (E.D. Pa. Oct. 23, 
2013). On May 5, 2014, the Court stayed and put this case in suspense pending the resolution of that appeal. The Third Circuit 
decided In re Avandia on October 26, 2015, and the parties in this case then filed briefs addressing the impact of the decision on 
GSK's motion to dismiss."
961,2," The following facts are drawn from Plaintiffs' Complaint, the well-pleaded factual allegations of which this Court must accept as 
true in evaluating the instant motion to dismiss. See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 679, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 
(2009)."
961,3," Drugs are deemed to be adulterated if the manufacturer fails to comply with cGMPs to assure the drugs' safety, quality, purity, 
identity, and strength and/or if they are contaminated. See 21 U.S.C. § 351(a)(2)(A), (B). Federal law prohibits a manufacturer 
from directly or indirectly causing adulterated drugs to be introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce. See 
id. § 331(a)."
961,4," The at-issue drugs in this case include Paxil, Paxil OS, Avandia, Avandamet, Coreg, Bactroban, Kytril, Compazine, Denavir, 
Dyazide, Dibenzyline, Thorazine, Stelazine, Relafen, Factive, Dyrenium, and Albenza. Compl. ¶ 3. Only some of these drugs-
Avandamet, Kytril, Bactroban, and Paxil CR—were found by the FDA to be adulterated. Nevertheless, Plaintiffs claim that 
because the Cidra plant was chronically in violation of FDA regulations, all of the at-issue drugs were adulterated."
961,5," The FDA issues ""Warning Letters"" to achieve voluntary compliance and to establish prior notice"" before initiating enforcement 
action.

962,6," Eckard also brought a qui tam suit under the False Claims Act in 2004, which was later joined by the Department of Justice. 
GSK eventually settled the suit for $600 million. See Pl.'s Rico Case Stmt. 5 (citing United States ex rel. Eckward v. SmithKline 
Beacham Corp., d/b/a/ GlacoSmithKline, et al., No. 04-CV-10375-JLT (D. Mass.)). "
963,7," As the same injury is alleged with respect to all claims, and because the parties do not argue that the respective injury 
standards for Plaintiffs' remaining claims differ in any material way, the Court will follow suit and analyze the injury issue in a 
RICO framework. See Toll Bros. v. Twp. of Readington, 555 F.3d 131, 139 n.5 (3d Cir. 2009)."
963,8," These cases generally deal with allegations of fraud and misrepresentation by defendant-drug companies engaged in off-label 
marketing which is prohibited by the FDA. "
964,9," Defendants argue In re Warfarin, an antitrust case, is inapplicable to RICO claims. Def.'s Reply Mem. in Supp. of its Mot. to 
Dismiss 5 (citing In re Schering-Plough Corp., 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 58900, 2009 WL 2043604, at *21; Dist. 1199P, 2008 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 103526, 2008 WL 5413105, at *6). The Third Circuit, however, found In re Warfarin applicable in In re Avandia, a 
RICO case, because ""RICO's standing requirements were modeled on antitrust law."" 804 F.3d at 639 n.32."
964,10," The fact that Plaintiffs alleged not overpayment, as in In re Avandia, but payment they would have not made at all due to the 
""worthlessness"" of the at-issue drugs is of no import. In In re Avandia, GSK argued the plaintiffs' claim that doctors relied on 
GSK's misrepresentations when prescribing the at-issue drug failed because there was no allegations that an alternative 
prescription would have been cheaper. 804 F.3d at 644-45. The Third Circuit rejected that argument, noting the plaintiffs' injury 
was not entirely contingent on the existence of cheaper alternative drugs because under plaintiffs' ""excess [*18]  price"" theory, 
they could show the at-issue drug cost too much regardless of whether cheaper drugs existed on the market. Id. at 645."
964,11," Defendants cite several cases for the proposition that cGMP violations alone are insufficient [*19]  to show a drug is defective 
and, therefore, resulted in economic harm to the party paying for the drug. However, the cases were decided before In re 
Avandia. They are also distinguishable on their facts and the standard applied. See In re McNeil Consumer Healthcare, 877 F. "
965,," Supp. 2d 254, 271 (E.D. Pa. 2012) (finding plaintiffs who purchased non-recalled drugs but ""claimed their losses arose at the 
time of sale because they paid premium prices for products that were manufactured at facilities with quality control problems"" 
and relied on ""experiences of other individuals"" who suffered adverse effects failed to state a cognizable injury); Polk v. KV

(9th Cir. 2010)."
965,12," An overview of the specific nature of the problems that occurred at the Cidra plant can be found in paragraph 77 of the 
Complaint. These problems are subsequently addressed in exhaustive detail between paragraphs 111-174. "
966,13," The limitations periods applicable to Plaintiffs' claims are as follows: (1) RICO claims are subject to a four-year statute of 
limitations, see Cetel v. Kirwan Fin. Grp., Inc., 460 F.3d 494, 506 (3d Cir. 2006); (2) claims for common law fraud are subject to 
a two-year statute of limitations, see Beauty Time, Inc. v. VU Skin Systems, Inc., 118 F.3d 140, 143 (3d Cir. 1997) (citing 42 Pa. 
Cons. Stat. § 5524(7)); (3) claims for statutory civil insurance fraud are subject to a two-year statute of limitations, see State 
Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Midtown Med. Ctr. Inc., 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4077, 2005 WL 627969, at *3 (E.D. Pa. 2005); (4) 
unjust enrichment claims are subject to a four-year statute of limitations, Harry Miller Corp. v. Mancuso Chemicals Ltd., 469 F. 
Supp. 2d 303, 319 (E.D. Pa. 2007); (5) negligent misrepresentation claims are subject to a two-year statute of limitations, see 
Cooper v. Sirota, 37 F. App'x 46, 48 (3d Cir. 2002); and (6) breach of warranty claims are subject to a four-year statute of 
limitations, Gunsalus v. Celotex Corp., 674 F. Supp. 1149, 1154-55 (E.D. Pa. 1987). "
967,14," ""Storm warnings"" include ""any information or accumulation of data that would alert a reasonable person to the probability that 
misleading statements or significant omissions had been made."" Cetel, 460 F.3d at 507. ""This charge saddles the investor with 
responsibilities like reading prospectuses, reports, and other information related to the investments, and, additionally, assumes 
knowledge of publicly available news articles and analyst's reports."" Id. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)."
967,15," The FDA describes a Form 483 as follows: An FDA Form 483 is issued to firm management at the conclusion of an inspection when an investigator(s) has observed 
any conditions that in their judgment may constitute violations of the Food Drug and Cosmetic (FD&C) Act and related Acts. 
. . . Observations are made when in the investigator's judgement, conditions or practices observed [*29]  would indicate that 
any food, drug, device or cosmetic has been adulterated or is being prepared, packed, or held under conditions whereby it 
may become adulterated or rendered injurious to health. . . . Companies are encouraged to respond to the FDA Form 483 
in writing with their corrective action plan and then implement that corrective action plan expeditiously. FDA Form 483 Frequently Asked Questions, http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/Inspections/ucm256377.htm (last visited Nov. 7, 2016)."
967,16," In making their arguments regarding inquiry notice, the parties rely on news articles and GSK's annual reports, which they 
attach as exhibits. It is not clear whether the Court may consider those exhibits at this stage. However, even considering such 
documents, the Court cannot decide the applicable statutes of limitations bar Plaintiffs' claims at this stage. "
968,17," Plaintiffs assert the Eckard case was filed under seal in 2004 and was not unsealed until July 16, 2007, less than four years 
before they filed suit in July 2011. Further, Plaintiffs assert the case remained unpublicized until 2010, except for brief one-
sentence references to the case in GSK's annual reports beginning in 2007. For example, in its 2007 Annual Report, published 
in 2008, GSK stated only that ""in [*31]  July 2007, the Group learned that the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts 
had unsealed a complaint brought by a former employee under the federal False Claims Act,"" i.e., the Eckard case."
968,18," Under the doctrine of fraudulent concealment, ""a corollary to the discovery rule,"" the statute of limitations is tolled where a 
plaintiff proves by ""clear, precise and convincing evidence"" that ""through fraud or concealment the defendant cause[d] the 
plaintiff to relax his vigilance or deviate from the right of inquiry."" Bohus v. Beloff, 950 F.2d 919, 925 (3d Cir. 1991) (citation 
omitted). ""There must be an affirmative and independent act of concealment that would divert or mislead the plaintiff from 
discovering the injury."" Id. Once fraudulent concealment is established, ""the statute of limitations is tolled until the plaintiff knew 
or using reasonable diligence should have known of the claim."" Id. at 925-26 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); see 
also In re Schering-Plough Corp. Intron, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 58900, 2009 WL 2043604, at *22 (""In addition, Plaintiffs' 
allegation that Defendants concealed their illegal conduct raises the possibility that the applicable statutory periods should be 
tolled and, by implication, creates an additional hurdle to establishing that the RICO claims are barred."")."
968,19," Defendants argue [*33]  ""extensive publicity"" of the cGMP issues would have caused a reasonable insurance company to 
conduct further investigation, citing In re Diet Drugs (Phentermine, Fenfluramine, Dexfenfluramine) Product Liability Litigation, 
352 F. Supp. 2d 533 (E.D. Pa. 2004). In that case, however, the district court found a consumer of a certain diet drug had inquiry 
notice of her potential claims following extensive publicity of the drug's recall, including (1) ""leading stories on major television 
network news programs;"" (2) a ""front-page story [in USA Today] regarding the withdrawal of [the] drugs, its effects, . . . the 
response by various organizations throughout the United States regarding the news,"" and ""potential [imminent] litigation""; (3) the 
defendant's efforts to notify consumers about the recall through press releases, full-page ads in leading national and regional 
newspapers, and a ""'Dear Health Care Provider Letter"" to approximately 450,000 physicians and pharmacists in which it 
informed them of the withdrawal of the drug from the market and of the potential association between use of the drugs and 
instances of valvular heart disease'""; and (4) the ""comprehensive publicity campaign surrounding the nationwide class action 
Settlement Agreement with [the defendant]."" Id. at 538-39. Furthermore, the court noted the plaintiff [*34]  in that case admitted 
she had inquiry notice of a problem potentially related to the diet drug in her deposition. Id. at 538. The publications and news 
coverage in this case fall short of such ""extensive publicity"" and outreach efforts. "
969,20," The coverage included (1) a 140-word Drug Industry Daily article noting that although the ""FDA ha[d] begun an investigation 
into manufacturing issues at [GSK's] facility in Cidra, Puerto Rico,"" the FDA ""did not tell GSK the specific nature of the 
investigation,"" and GSK ""would not interrupt the supply from the plant,"" see Def.'s Mot. to Dismiss, Ex. 10; (2) an article in The 
Guardian, ""Glaxo plant in Puerto Rico under FDA scrutiny,"" which noted GSK was uninformed about the specific nature of the 
FDA's investigation, [*35]  and quoted finance director John Coombe as stating, ""'The issues raised [in the FDA's Warning 
Letter] were fully resolved and closed up. The FDA are now back. They are being quite coy about exactly what they are looking 
for,'"" id., Ex. 9; (3) a 253-word article from HIS Global Insight, ""GSK Plant in Puerto Rico Faces FDA Manufacturing Probe,"" 
noting "" it remains unclear precisely what the FDA is investigating;"" id., Ex. 11; and (4) a 274-word article from the Glasgow 
Herald, ""Glaxo pre-tax profits climb 22% to (pounds) 1.7bn,"" which references the investigation in a single line noting ""investors 
were also unnerved by news that the [FDA] was investigating a Glaxo factory in Puerto Rico,"" id., Ex. 12. "
970,21," GSK argues Plaintiffs' breach of warranty claims are barred by the statute of limitations because the discovery rule does not 
apply to such claims. Def.'s Mot. to Dismiss 25-26 (citing 13 Pa. Cons. Stat. §§ 2725(a)-(b), 5525(a)(2)); see also Gunsalus, 674 
F. Supp. at 1154-55 (discovery rule does not toll statute of limitations on breach of warranty claims unless there is an explicit 
warranty of future performance). In response, Plaintiffs argue fraudulent concealment equitably tolls the limitations period for 
warranty claims, as it does for their other claims. Pls.' [*39]  Opp'n 27 n.23 (citing In re Ford Motor Co. E-350 Van Prods. Liab. 
Litig., No. 03-4558, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 73690, 2008 WL 4126264, at *18-19 (D.N.J. Sept. 3, 2008), and Connaught Labs., 
Inc. v. Lewis, 124 Pa. Commw. 568, 557 A.2d 40, 43-44 (Pa. Cmmw. Ct. 1989)). Because the Court will not decide whether 
fraudulent concealment tolls the statute of limitations, the question of whether Plaintiffs' breach of warranty claims are barred is 
also left for another day. "
977,1," The Court's ruling that Swisher is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law renders its previous order for a new trial 
moot. But, even were the Court to deny Swisher's motion for reconsideration, it would still deny Trendsettah's motion for the 
reasons discussed in II, supra. "
978,2," Because the Court finds that Swisher did not waive its objection, it does not address whether Trendsettah conceded that 
harmless error applies. Def. Opp'n at 9, Docket No. 269."
978,3," Because the Court finds that it previously applied the proper standard it does not address whether Swisher is entitled to a new 
trial under the plain error standard. "
992,1," For example, one reason a manufacturer might want to set retail prices is to encourage dealers to provide services without 
worrying that consumers will take advantage of the services while buying the product at a lower price from another dealer who 
does not provide such services. VIII Areeda ¶ 1601e. "
994,2," The single case that plaintiffs cite in support of their argument for horizontal classification is of no help. The case is Am. Motor 
Inns, Inc. v. Holiday Inns, Inc., 521 F.2d 1230 (3d Cir. 1975). (See Pls.' Opp. at 15 n.62.) Holiday Inn licensed some independent 
franchisees but also owned some of the franchisees, leading the Third Circuit to conclude that ""since HI, in one of its capacities, 
was dealing on the same market level as its franchisees, its contracts that, in effect, foreclosed such franchisees from operating 
either Holiday Inns or non-Holiday Inns in cities where HI operated an inn, except with HI's permission, constitute market 
allocation agreements among competitors"" and therefore are illegal per se. Am. Motor Inns, 521 F.2d at 1254. This case is 
inapposite because it is equivalent to a manufacturer owning some of its dealers, not to a manufacturer supplying an 
independent dealer with both a branded and a generic product. Furthermore, the Areeda treatise explains [**25]  that the court 
was wrong to characterize the agreement as illegal per se, because ""[t]he legitimate reasons a manufacturer may have for 
limiting intrabrand competition among dealers are no less applicable when it owns one or more of the dealerships."" VIII Areeda ¶ 
1605c. "
995,3," Note that the F.T.C. reporter erroneously labels the statement of Commissioner Joshua D. Wright as a Dissenting Statement, 
when the text shows that it is in fact a Concurring Statement. See id. at 54. In total, three commissioners voted for the consent 
order and one commissioner voted against it. "
996,4," HN20[
] In multi-district litigation, a transferee court should apply the law of its own circuit [**35]  to federal issues, including 
procedural issues. Multidistrict Litigation Manual § 9:18 (2016); see In re Korean Air Lines Disaster of Sept. 1, 1983, 829 F.2d 
1171, 1174-76, 265 U.S. App. D.C. 39 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (transferee court should apply its own law to federal issues); In re "
997,," Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc., ATX, ATX II, 128 F.Supp.2d 1198, 1200 (S.D. Ind. 2001) (transferee court should apply its own law 
to procedural issues)."
997,5," This Court will not follow the Sixth Circuit, which dismissed a multi-state class action complaint because it would be ""measured 
by the legal requirements of different state laws,"" without even considering the possibility of grouping, see Pilgrim, 660 F.3d at 
947-50, because that result contravenes the D.C. Circuit's recognition that multi-state classes can be certified if grouping is 
possible. "
1000,6," Analyzing this issue under Rule 23 rather than as [**45]  a standing question does not leave courts helpless to prevent ""lengthy 
class discovery"" when plaintiffs ""propos[e] to represent the claims of parties whose injuries and modes of redress they would not 
share."" Wellbutrin, 260 F.R.D. at 155. A court can still dismiss a class claim or require additional named plaintiffs if it is apparent 
from the complaint that the original named plaintiffs will not satisfy the adequacy and commonality requirements to represent a 
class under other states' laws. Cf. In re Carrier IQ, Inc., 78 F. Supp. 3d 1051, 1074 (N.D. Cal. 2015) (requiring the plaintiffs ""to 
present a named class member who possesses individual standing to assert each state law's claims"" because otherwise ""there 
is a meaningful risk that the requirements of class certification under Rule 23 may not be met""). "
1001,7," Defendants treat this as a problem of overbreadth or ascertainability of the class. (See McCormick's Mem. at 31-35.) Some 
courts use those terms, but others treat this as a problem of predominance. See, e.g., Byrd, 784 F.3d at 167-69; Castano, 84 
F.3d at 745."
1001,8, Any argument about manageability (see McCormick's Mem. at 36-37) is also premature. 
1057,1," The Court also ordered supplemental briefing on the separate but related issue of whether the DAPs' evidence of upstream 
pass-on should be excluded. ECF Nos. 4674 (""DAP Suppl. Br.""); 4675 (""Def. Suppl. Br."")."
1057,2," ECF Nos. 3676-4 (""Def. Opp'n""), 3757-4 (""DAP Reply""), 3654 (""DAP Opp'n""), 3666 (""Sharp Opp'n""), 3770 (""Def. Reply"")."
1057,3," ""Upstream pass-on"" (also called ""upstream pass-through"") is the amount of a collusive overcharge passed from entities higher 
in the distribution chain to entities down the chain. See generally ECF No. 4742 (""MSJ Order re Standing"") at 10-12. Here, it 
refers to the amount of the alleged overcharge CRT Finished Product Manufacturers passed on to the DAPs. "
1060,4," Although Defendants recite the requirements of ""antitrust standing"" and ""antitrust injury,"" those concepts have nothing to do 
with the substance of their motion. To the extent Defendants are attempting through their motion in limine to re-litigate 
arguments presented in their motions for summary judgment, the Court declines the invitation to reconsider those issues."
1060,5," As with evidence of upstream pass-on, Defendants use the term ""antitrust injury"" but the substance of their argument relates to 
injury-in-fact. Defendants also claim that evidence of market power is relevant to ""address express overcharge pass-through 
assumptions made by Plaintiffs' damages expert."" Id. As explained infra Section III, however, neither party will be permitted to 
submit evidence of pass-through on the issue of damages. "
1062,6," Among other DAPs, Defendants' motion was filed with respect to DAP Sharp, even though Sharp is a direct purchaser to whom 
the issue of upstream pass through does not apply. Defendants' motion with respect to Sharp is therefore denied for this 
independent reason."
1062,7," Defendants' supplemental brief argues again why they should be able to introduce evidence showing that DAPs paid less than 
the entire overcharge amount. Specifically, Defendants assert that upstream pass-on should be permitted because Royal 
Printing does not apply where plaintiffs purchased finished products incorporating the price-fixed good instead of the price-fixed 
good itself. If Royal Printing does not apply, then DAPs do not have standing and the issue of the admissibility of pass-on 
evidence is moot. But that is not the question before the Court on this motion. The question is, assuming DAPs have standing 
pursuant to Royal Printing, should the Court exclude evidence and argument of upstream pass-on regarding damages 
calculations. Defendants failed to respond to that question. "
1070,1," Pursuant to Local Rule 7.1(d), the Court declines to consider Defendants' standing argument— unsupported by citations to 
relevant legal authority. "
1081,1," The pharmaceutical retail outlets are CVS, Inc.; Eckerd Corporation; Giant Eagle, Inc.; HEB Grocery Co. LP; JCG (PJC) USA, 
LLC; the Kroger Company; Maxi Drug, Inc. d/b/a Brooks Pharmacy; Rite Aid Corporation; Rite Aid Headquarters Corporation; 
Safeway Incorporated; Supervalu, Inc.; and Walgreen Co. "
1082,2," The court rejected as too speculative another causal mechanism -- namely, that Teva could have won its paragraph IV suit and 
obtained a final, nonappealable judgment that AstraZeneca's Nexium patents were invalid or not infringed. That theoretical 
victory could, in turn, have triggered the regulatory 75-day window within which Ranbaxy had to launch its generic or forfeit its 
first-filer exclusivity. Id. at 289-90. "
1084,3," The vigor with which the plaintiffs acknowledged the admission of evidence on the Ranbaxy reverse payment is worth noting: From the very beginning of this case the payment to Ranbaxy has been in clearly as at least an overt act in furtherance of 
the conspiracy. . . . But for [the defendants] to come here now and say, Oh, this was never in the case, that simply from our 
perspective is not true. It was unclear exactly how much and what role that payment was going to make, but it was clear it 
was in this as an overt act . . . . And we made our tactical choices and [the defendants] made theirs. "
1087,4," As a threshold matter, the defendants argue that the plaintiffs are judicially estopped from appealing the exclusion of McGuire's 
Event Study, as they agreed to give up that evidence to defeat the defendants' mistrial motion. We need not reach this claim. "
1093,5," In their proposed special jury verdict form, the plaintiffs suggested precisely the same split in questions between antitrust 
violation and antitrust injury (in the form of a delayed generic entry)."
1093,6," Because the plaintiffs do not appeal the district court's denial of their post-trial motion for an injunction, they evidently seek a 
new trial in order to recover damages. "
1095,7," In fact, the district court in Teikoku expressly distinguished In re Nexium, describing it as ""a case where the generic 
manufacturer moved for summary judgment, and offered unrebutted evidence 'that an at risk launch was ""unlikely"" and 
""extremely risky.""'"" 74 F. Supp. 3d at 1074. In contrast, Teikoku dealt with ""a motion to dismiss and defendants cite[d] to no 
comparable evidence that [wa]s properly before the [c]ourt at th[at] juncture."" Id. "
1097,8," Of course, as we have now repeated numerous times, the plaintiffs voluntarily chose not to pursue the causal mechanism 
involving Teva's at-risk launch after the district court informed them that such an argument would trigger jury instructions about 
their need to prove patent invalidity. "
1102,1," See also Isaksen v. Vt. Castings, Inc., 825 F.2d 1158, 1165 (7th Cir. 1987) (reversing an award of damages for an antitrust 
violation where the plaintiff measured the difference between his profits [**8]  before and after the unlawful activity, because the 
plaintiff ""made no effort to establish how much of the loss was due to that activity as distinct from unrelated business factors""); 
Philip E. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law ¶ 392b (4th ed. 2014) (""[T]he antitrust damage calculation must isolate "
1103,," the effect of the antitrust violation. It should not include any other effects—good or bad—that influence the financial condition of 
the plaintiff."")."
1103,2," Gumwood also argues that Dr. Frech's analysis is tied to Gumwood's theory of liability, which is that ""Simon's tying caused 
Gumwood to lose Ann Taylor LOFT (a key tenant), which caused Gumwood to lose rental revenue from LFOT and other tenants 
as well as the loss of other tenants."" [DE 201 p. 17]. However, Dr. Frech expressly denied that his opinion was tied to Ann Taylor 
or any other retailer or retailers. [Frech Dep. p. 137 (""Q. [**10]  Are you making the assumption in your calculation of damages 
that Ann Taylor would have opened a store [at Heritage Square] in the absence of the alleged tie-in? A. No. It doesn't go that 
way. That's not the way that the model works.""). "
1104,3," Dr. Frech also did not explain why the recession—which he concedes would have had a substantial effect on Heritage 
Square—would not have caused its own snowball effect. "
1105,4," Dr. Frech's damages opinion only measured the reduction in revenues from 2011 forward (specifically, the present value of 
those future revenues as of the date the property was transferred to the lender), so these revenues from 2009 are not part of his 
damages figure, [Frech Report ¶ 191], but this illustrates how the co-tenancy provisions had a significant effect on Heritage 
Square's revenues."
1105,5," Simon's expert did conduct such an analysis in calculating the damages that would have resulted from unlawful coercion of 
Ann Taylor, and found that Ann Taylor alone would not have made the difference [**17]  as to whether any co-tenancy 
provisions in other leases were met. Dr. Frech's only response to that analysis was to speculate that other, additional effects 
might have combined to satisfy some of the co-tenancy provisions, but he never evaluated what that would have required or how 
that would affect his damages opinion."
1105,6," According to Dr. Meyer, whose calculation Dr. Frech did not dispute, Heritage Square's revenues from Ann Taylor would have 
been $28,739 over about the first four years of the lease, as most of the revenue from that period was offset by an initial 
construction allowance. Over the next six years, Ann Taylor's rent would been $139,849 per year. Adding other reimbursements 
for which Ann Taylor would have been responsible, the total revenues to Heritage Square would have been about $1 million. 
However, since the co-tenancy provision in Ann Taylor's lease could [**19]  not have been met, the actual revenues would likely 
have been less, though it is not clear by how much."
1105,7," The investments upon which Dr. Frech based his alternative ""before"" figure were tied to the result of the appraisal, so the same 
concerns would apply to that approach. "
1106,8," [DE 194-1 p. 216-17 (""Q. . . . [T]he appraisal report was explicitly based on certain assumptions that the appraisers were not 
verifying, correct? A. Correct. . . . Q. . . . Did you attempt to verify the accuracy of any of these assumptions? A. I would say 
no."")]. "
1107,9," See also Zenith, 401 U.S. at 338 (""In the context of a continuing conspiracy to violate the antitrust laws, . . . each time a plaintiff 
is injured by an act of the defendants a cause of action accrues to him to recover the damages caused by that act and . . . , as to 
those damages, the statute of limitations runs from the commission of the act."" (emphasis added)); Hanover Shoe, Inc. v. United 
Shoe Mach. Corp., 392 U.S. 481, 88 S. Ct. 2224, 20 L. Ed. 2d 1231 (1968) (allowing the plaintiff to bring an antitrust claim in 
1955 for conduct that began in 1912, but permitting recovery of only the damages that accrued within the limitations period);

the continuing violation extended into the limitations period, but noting that ""[a]ny harm that accrues after the tolling of the statute 
of limitations periods but that is associated with an overt act that occurred prior to the limitations period is not remediable""); 
Areeda ¶ 320c6 (""Even in the case of the continuing conspiracy or violation, . . . plaintiffs are ordinarily limited to damages for 
the four years immediately preceding the filing of their lawsuit."")."
1107,10," Gumwood also did not dispute Simon's assertion at summary judgment that Gumwood knew by March 2007 that Charming 
Shoppes was not going to lease at Heritage Square. [See DE 131 p. 6]. "
1108,11," Gumwood's pretrial filings raise the discovery rule for the first time, but it has given no indication that that rule would affect the 
accrual of these injuries. Gumwood was aware of each of these injuries as they occurred, and it believed Simon to be 
responsible, which is all the discovery rule requires. In re Copper Antitrust Lit., 436 F.3d 782, 789 (7th Cir. 2006) (""[A]ccrual 
occurs when the plaintiff discovers that 'he has been injured and who caused the injury."")). [See DE 132-64 (in an April 2007 
email from a Gumwood representative, repeatedly asserting that Ann Taylor's actions were caused by Heritage Square's 
""resilient competitor"")]."
1108,12," Gumwood's motion in limine separately seeks to exclude the fact that Gumwood previously filed claims against Simon in state 
court. Simon does not oppose that motion, so it is granted. As discussed at the final pretrial conference, though, this evidence 
may become relevant if Gumwood opens the door, such as by accusing Simon of committing tortious interference with contract. "
1111,13," See also In re Aluminum Warehousing Antitrust Litig., 833 F.3d 151, 158 (2d Cir. 2016) (""'Competitors and consumers in the 
market where trade is allegedly restrained are presumptively the proper plaintiffs to allege antitrust injury.'"" (quoting Serpa Corp. 
v. McWane, Inc., 199 F.3d 6, 10 (1st Cir. 1999))); Sports Racing Servs., Inc. v. Sports Car Club of Am., Inc., 131 F.3d 874, 887 
(10th Cir. 1997) (""[T]wo types of parties may have standing to challenge illegal tying arrangements—the purchasers who are 
forced to buy the tied product to obtain the tying product . . . , and the competitor who is restrained from entering the market for 
the tied product . . . .""); Areeda ¶ 358a. "
1112,14," Because the leases [**48]  in question were back-loaded as a result of construction allowances, the vast majority of the 
revenues from those leases would have been realized after the lender took ownership of Heritage Square. "
1113,15," The collateral source rule would resolve this choice the same way. EEOC v. O'Grady, 857 F.2d 383, 391 (7th Cir. 1988)."
1113,16," For similar reasons, antitrust claims can only be transferred between parties by express assignment; if transferring the 
affected property was itself enough to transfer the antitrust claim for harm to that property, the direct-purchaser rule would be a 
nullity. Gulfstream III Assocs., Inc. v. Gulfstream Aerospace Corp., 995 F.2d 425, 437-40 (3d Cir. 1993) (""[W]e see the issues of 
assignment and application of the direct purchaser rule as corollaries.""). Here, Gumwood would have owned the entirety of any 
claim for damage to Heritage Square when that claim accrued, at which time it was the sole owner of Heritage Square, and it did 
not expressly transfer its claim when it executed the deed in lieu of foreclosure, which further indicates that Gumwood is still 
entitled to pursue the entire claim for damage to Heritage Square. Also, the party that purchased the note and accepted the 
deed in lieu of foreclosure would not have been damaged by the antitrust violation, as the price it had just paid to purchase the 
note from the original lender would have reflected the reduction in the future revenues."
1113,17," UtiliCorp, 497 U.S. at 208 (""The direct [**50]  purchaser rule serves, in part, to eliminate the complications of apportioning 
overcharges between direct and indirect purchasers.""); Illinois Brick, 431 U.S. at 737 (""Permitting the use of pass-on theories 
under § 4 essentially would transform treble-damages actions into massive efforts to apportion the recovery among all potential 
plaintiffs that could have absorbed part of the overcharge from direct purchasers to middlemen to ultimate consumers. However 
appealing this attempt to allocate the overcharge might seem in theory, it would add whole new dimensions of complexity to 
treble-damages suits and seriously undermine their effectiveness.""); see also William M. Landes & Richard A. Posner, The 
Economics of Passing On: A Reply to Harris and Sullivan, 128 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1274, 1274-75 (1980). The Supreme Court has 
also noted that even if allocating damages may be easy in a particular case, the direct-purchaser rule should nonetheless apply 
for simplicity and clarity. UtiliCorp, 497 U.S. at 217 (""[E]ven assuming that any economic assumptions underlying the Illinois 
Brick rule might be disproved in a specific case, we think it an unwarranted and counterproductive exercise to litigate a series of 
exceptions.""); see also State of Ill. ex rel. Burris v. Panhandle E. Pipe Line Co., 935 F.2d 1469, 1477-78 (7th Cir. 1991). "
1115,18," Given the Court's holding in the previous section, Simon may not present Dr. Meyer's damages calculation (which only 
includes damages that accumulated through 2010) as comprising the entirety of Gumwood's damages, but Dr. Meyer's opinion 
as to the amount of damages through 2010 is still relevant. Thus, Dr. Meyer may still opine that ""the damages to Gumwood in 
the 2006 to 2010 period as a result of Simon's alleged tying amount to $28,739,"" but she may not opine that ""Gumwood would 
[not] have avoided defaulting on the mortgage loan even if it had received additional profits in the but-for world, and, thus, there 
are no damages to Gumwood from 2011 onwards."" [Meyer Report ¶ 146]. "
1120,1," The petition refers [**3]  to State Farm in general and does not always designate which individual State Farm entity is currently 
being referenced. Thus, when we use the term ""State Farm"" we use it in the same sense as the Clarys in their petition, as a 
general reference to whatever State Farm entity is being represented at the time."
1120,2," At some time during the pendency of this litigation, Patrick White and Kimberly Rollins were married. "
1121,3," The denial of a defendant's peremptory exception of no cause of action is not normally appealable as it is not identified as one 
of those judgments appealable pursuant to La.CodeCiv.P. art. 1915. However, La.R.S. 51:134-35 provides an expedited appeal 
for certain interlocutory judgments rendered in antitrust litigation. "
1122,4," The meeting was attended by Mr. Eagles, Mr. Clary, David Haymon, and Ms. Rollins."
1122,5," This time, Mr. White and Lindsey Cutler, both State Farm Agency Field Consultants, joined Mr. Eagles, Mr. Clary, David 
Haymon, and Ms. Rollins. "
1123,6," The difference between the two contracts is that the TICA Agreement is for a set term and the AAO5 contract is a lifetime 
agreement."

Division overseeing State Farm's Louisiana agencies. "
1130,1," Louisiana Code of Civil Procedure Article 1915 provides this court with the jurisdictional basis for appeal in general. It was 
revised by the legislature effective August 1, 2013, and that version of the article is applicable to this court's determination of 
jurisdiction."
1130,2," Louisiana Revised Statutes 51:134 provides: In all cases under this Part the defendant shall file all exceptions in limine litis, or if necessary in the alternative, after the 
usual delays, and any additional delays as the court may allow; however, a plea to the jurisdiction is not waived by other 
pleas or exceptions filed. The judge shall take up such exceptions in preference over all other business and shall decide all 
questions raised in the exceptions within ten days after submission, and his ruling shall have the effect of res judicata, 
unless the party cast shall appeal within five days. The appeal is returnable within ten days to the appellate court which 
shall hear and determine the case within forty days. If the exceptions are overruled by final judgment of the appellate court, 
the defendant shall file his answer covering all questions of controverted fact within fifteen days, and the case may be set 
for trial on the application of either party, which case the judge shall consider [**35]  in preference over all other business."
1130,3," Louisiana Code of Civil Procedure Article 1915 was revised by the legislature effective August 1, 2013, and that version of the 
article is applicable to this court's determination of jurisdiction. "
1131,4," Louisiana Constitution of 1974 Article V, § 10(A) provided (emphasis added): Jurisdiction. Except as otherwise provided by this constitution, a court of appeal has appellate jurisdiction of (1) all civil 
matters, including direct review of administrative agency determinations in worker's compensation matters as heretofore or 
hereafter provided by law, (2) all matters appealed from family and juvenile courts, and (3) all criminal cases triable by a 
jury, except as provided in Section 5, Paragraph (D)(2) of this Article. It has supervisory jurisdiction over cases which

1141,5," Toshiba also cites Int'l Bhd. Of Teamsters c. Philip Morris, Inc., 196 F.3d 818, 828 (7th Cir. 1999), which did not address 
standing under the IAA, and United States ex rel. Blaum v. Triad Isotopes, Inc., 104 F. Supp. 3d 901, 913-14 (N.D. Ill. 2015), 
which speculated but did not reach the issue of whether the AGC standing test would apply to a claim under the IAA. The State 
also points this out in their Response. Resp. at 9. "
1142,6," Toshiba acknowledges an exception to the requirement that the alleged injury occur in the same market where the anti-
competitive conduct purportedly took place, but further argues that the claim at issue does not meet that exception: this is where 
a plaintiff who is not a market participant incurs injuries which are nevertheless ""inextricably intertwined"" with those of actual 
market participants. MSJ at 11-12 (citing Blue Shield of Va. V. McCready, 457 U.S. 465 (1982); Province v. Cleveland Press 
Publ'g Co., 787 F.2d 1047, 1052 (6th Cir. 1986); Crimpers Promotions, Inc. v. Home Box Office, Inc., 724 F.2d 290, 294-95 (2d 
Cir. 1983). "
1144,7," The State also argues that, even if this Court were to apply the analysis from AGC to the instant case, that those factors would 
be sufficiently met to withstand a motion for summary judgment, and goes into detailed arguments on the merits of each factor. 
Resp. 11-25. "
1145,8," Section 3 of the IAA defines the type of conduct that may be considered a violation of the Act, including but not limited to 
agreements between competitors ""for the purpose or with the effect of fixing prices of goods bought or sold by the parties to the

1147,9," The only other Illinois cases which cite AGC are Pankros v. Tyler, 401 III. App. 3d 936 (1st Dist. 2010), which discussed 
whether a plaintiff had sufficiently alleged a claim under the federal racketeering statute (18 U.S.C. § 1961, et seq.), and 
Holzrichter, 231 Ill. App. 3d 256, which cited but did not discuss AGC with regard to the fact that the IAA, like federal law, 
requires pleading of an ""antitrust injury"" where it states in Section 7 (740 ILCS 10/7) that an action may be brought where a 
person has been injured in their business or property by a violation of Section 3 of the IAA (740 ILCS 10/3). "

1149,14," Toshiba also cites Paladin Assocs. v. Montana Power Co., 328 F.3d 1145, 1158 (9th Cir. 2003), which did not rely on AGC, 
where the court held that ""aspects of a defendant's conduct that are beneficial or neutral to competition"" cannot form the basis of 
any antitrust injury because such injury must be of a type that arises out of an antitrust violation. That case is clearly inapposite 
to the facts alleged here, which concern injury purportedly arising out of a conspiracy to fix prices and restrict output. Compl.

""TPO"" and that this is to whom the report refers. Resp. at 18. "
1154,5," The Court notes that, in addition to the four paragraphs cited by Toshiba, factual allegations about Seiko, IPS Alpha, and 
Sanyo, are also set forth in paragraphs 14, 18, 62, 66, and 75, of the Complaint. While paragraphs 14 and 18 refer only to the 
alleged relationship between named Defendants and certain ""Unpleaded Conspirators,"" paragraph 62 alleges that a 
representative of Samsung was asked by a representative of Sanyo to raise its prices for certain LCD products, paragraph 66 
alleges that a representative of Sharp was ""reassured"" by a representative of Sanyo of certain pricing plans, and paragraph 75 
alleges that certain Defendants discussed inviting Sanyo to meetings at which further discussion on pricing would take place."
1154,6," The Court notes that the Multidistrict Litigation proceeded in federal court and was therefore subject to the more liberal notice 
pleading standards applicable under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. See Bell All. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 556-57 
(2007). Toshiba has also pointed this out. Reply at 5. "

App. 3d 1, 8 (1st Dist. 1984). "
1158,11," Toshiba also cites a decision from the Multidistrict Litigation, but that decision dealt with allegations as to defendants' 
agreement to take part in the conspiracy, not their alleged liability for the actions of other co-conspirators. MSJ at 7 (citing In re 
TFT-LCD Antitrust Litig., 586 F. Supp. 2d 1109, 1117 (N.D. Cal. 2008)). Toshiba also acknowledges, as this Court has 
previously, that determinations in that case are not binding in the instant case. Reply at 4. Toshiba also provides a copy of an 
order from related litigation in the state of Washington which they say evidences the decision of the Judge in that case that 
defendants were entitled to summary judgment ""as to the sales of any entities not described in the Attorney General's operative 
complaint."" Reply at 6. The attached order from the case in question, however, provides no basis for the decision and merely 
indicates that a motion to dismiss damages based on sales from ""Undisclosed Conspirators"" was granted in part as to six out of 
sixteen such entities. Reply Ex. B. "

1160,14," While the Court has previously ruled on specific evidentiary questions, for example, whether depositions taken in the 
Multidistrict Litigation and noticed pursuant to federal rules can be utilized as evidence depositions in the instant suit, the Court "

1165,20," The State also says in its Response that it has evidence that ""Acer was an independent member of the conspiracy"" prior to 
merging with Unipac in 2001 to form AU Optronics Corporation, one of the Defendants named in the Complaint. Resp. at 14. 
The fact of the merger between Acer and Unipac is alleged in the Complaint and is not disputed by Toshiba. Compl. ¶ 4. The 
State further says it has evidence that Samsung admitted exchanging price information with Acer on May 4, 2001, prior to the 
merger. Resp. at 14; Resp. Ex. 10. Finally, the State says it has evidence that a representative of LG (also a named Defendant) 
has previously testified that he attended meetings at which Acer (referred to as ""ADT"") was also in attendance where prices 
were coordinated between competitors. Resp. at 14; Resp. Ex. 16. Toshiba does not address the purported evidence pertaining 
to either Samsung or LG and Acer. "
1166,21," The Court notes that testimony referring to a discussion about factories in the excerpt of the deposition provided by the State 
is a different discussion, which was said to have occurred after AU Optronics was established, and not apparently the same as 
the earlier discussion about ""collaboration."" Resp. Ex. 14. Toshiba has provided an excerpt from another deposition, taken 
approximately two years earlier, which indicates that the same representative of Sharp discussed the possibility of building a 
factory with Acer, but it is not clear from that testimony whether this refers to the same conversation. Reply Ex. C."
1166,22," The Court notes that the excerpt of testimony provided by the State in support of this statement indicates only that ""capacity

16."
1166,23," The Court notes that the deposition testimony provided in support of the statement by Toshiba regarding whether Quanta was 
a competitor does not appear to refer to the same time period as the deposition testimony provided by the State in support of its 
statement, and that, to the extent they could be viewed as referring to the same time period, they would appear to contradict one 
another with respect to the business relationship between LG and Quanta as characterized therein. Resp. Ex. 16; Reply Ex. D. "
1175,1," In light of our conclusion that the antitrust verdict must be reversed, we do not consider BD's other objections to the antitrust 
verdict, including: the district court's refusal to give the jury BD's requested ""Stearns instruction,"" the district court's admission of 
the patent verdict, the district court's refusal of BD's request for a special verdict form, or BD's various objections to the RTI 
damage model. "
1177,2," RTI also alleged that BD falsely promoted its safety syringes as ""safe,"" but the court found insufficient evidence to support 
sending this claim to the jury, and RTI has not appealed. "
1178,3," Our decision in Multiflex, Inc. v. Samuel Moore & Co., 709 F.2d 980 (5th Cir. 1983) is not to the contrary. The conduct in 
Multiflex involved a conspiracy by Samuel Moore with three industry manufacturer-distributors to prevent Multiflex from 
accessing the channels of distribution. Id. at 988. This conduct would have excluded Multiflex—Samuel Moore's only other "
1179,," competitor—from the market by preventing Multiflex from reaching the end-users of its product because the end-users made 
their purchases of hydraulic hoses exclusively through the three manufacturer-distributors. Id. at 984, 988. The false and 
disparaging statements made by Samuel Moore to Multiflex's bankers and customers about [**20]  the firm's solvency and 
product quality, id. at 991-92, 994 n.14, were anticompetitive because these statements were part and parcel of the conspiracy 
that threatened to cut off Multiflex—its only other competitor—from the channels of distribution. In this case, BD's false 
advertising had no comparable potential to eliminate competition."
1179,4," At oral argument RTI argued that the hospitals were averse to trying new products. It appears, however, [**23]  that most of the 
evidence at trial relating to this point focused on BD's alleged ""anticompetitive contracting"" practices—an argument that the jury 
rejected. "
1180,5," Trial testimony by Dr. Carl Vartian explained that hospitals employ multidisciplinary committees made up of hospital 
administrators, specialists, and general physicians to evaluate the safety of products like syringes. Hospital purchasing decisions 
also involve extensive review of medical literature, consultation with other hospitals that already use the product, and trial 
periods for new products within a ward or subdivisions of the hospital. Both Dr. Vartian and Nurse Jeanette Akin testified that 
when it comes to advertising for products like syringes, ""we usually don't even look at it"" and ""we don't give that much credibility"" 
when making purchasing decisions. "
1181,6," This conduct is a far cry from corporate bribery and filing sham lawsuits, see Page Airways, 624 F.2d at 1356, or from 
deliberately reducing one's own sales to harm the competitor's business, see Aspen Skiing, 472 U.S. at 610-11."
1181,7," The only ""evidence"" for this plan is one internal BD planning document, dated 2011, that evaluated the market for retractable 
syringes and offered various alternative suggestions for producing a new, low-cost retractable syringe that would avoid 
""dissatisfiers"" in products then on the market. Even if the plan had been adopted, its cornerstone, as hypothesized by RTI's 
selective reading, was to take advantage of RTI's technology after the company's patents expire. As has been noted, this course 
of action would be both legal and procompetitive. "
1184,8," To the extent the court prohibited BD's use of the ""needle sharpness"" and ""waste space"" advertisements and required the 
implementation of a training program to instruct employees and distributors not to use the old marketing materials, BD does not 
challenge that injunctive relief. "
1189,**," The Honorable Randall L. Dunn, United States Bankruptcy Judge for the District of Oregon, sitting by designation."
1189,1," Unless specified otherwise, all chapter and section references are to the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §§ 101-1532, all ""Rule"" 
references are to the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, and all ""Civil Rule"" references are to the Federal Rules of Civil 
Procedure. "
1190,2," For example, in the statement for October 2013 (the month in which the Taylors filed for bankruptcy), the ending balance was a 
paltry $364.24. However, the beginning balance was $4,028.75, with deposits totaling $15,659.53 and withdrawals totaling 
$19,308.04. Withdrawals included payments to Kohl's Department Stores, DirecTV, Netflix, and Experian credit reporting."
1190,3," The bankruptcy court later granted the Taylors' motion to dismiss the entire complaint as to Mrs. Taylor and the §§ 523(a)(4) 
and (2)(A) claims as to Mr. Taylor. "
1192,4," None of the parties raise the issue of the timing of the transfer and concealment in satisfaction of the separate sub-parts of §§ 
727(a)(2). Nevertheless, the record is clear that Mr. Taylor concealed his property both in the year prior to filing his chapter 7 
petition (by not disclosing the TTI Account so as to avoid creditors' liens) and after the bankruptcy filing (by not including TTI or 
the TTI Account in his schedules and denying at the § 341(a) meeting that he was aware of the TTI Account). The record also 
reveals that Mr. Taylor admitted that he deposited personal funds into the TTI Account and made withdrawals for personal and 
family expenses, although the timing of those transactions is less clear. At a minimum, the bank statements provided by Ms. 
Good show that Mr. Taylor made personal deposits and withdrawals for personal expenses during the year prior to his 
bankruptcy filing, in satisfaction of § 727(a)(2)(A)."
1192,5," At the conclusion of the trial, the bankruptcy court orally found that Mr. Taylor had an intent to hinder or delay his creditors and 
stated that it need not reach the question whether he had an intent to defraud. However, in its subsequent written findings 
(prepared by counsel), it stated that Mr. Taylor had ""the intent to hinder, delay and defraud his creditors . . . ."" (Emphasis 
added.) We need not resolve this discrepancy. HN5[
] The court's written order prevails over any oral findings. See Rawson v. Calmar S.S. Corp., 304 F.2d 202, 206 (9th Cir. 1962) (stating that the court's oral ""comment is superseded by the findings of 
fact. The trial judge is not to be lashed to the mast on his off-hand remarks in announcing decision prior to the presumably more 
carefully considered deliberate findings of fact""). Further, the statute is written in the disjunctive, and we may affirm even without a finding of an intent to defraud. See In re Retz, 
606 F.3d at 1200. It is clear that Mr. Taylor intended to hinder and delay creditors, so we need not consider whether the 
bankruptcy court erred in finding that he also had an intent to defraud. "
1193,6," Various factors, called ""badges of fraud,"" may constitute circumstantial evidence of intent. In re Beverly, 374 B.R. at 243. These factors, not all of which need be present, include (1) a close relationship between the transferor and the transferee; 
(2) that the transfer was in anticipation of a pending suit; (3) that the transferor Debtor was insolvent or in poor financial 
condition at the time; (4) that all or substantially all of the Debtor's property was transferred; (5) that the transfer so 
completely depleted the Debtor's assets that the creditor has been hindered or delayed in recovering any part of the 
judgment; and (6) that the Debtor received inadequate consideration for the transfer. Emmett Valley Assocs. v. Woodfield (In re Woodfield), 978 F.2d 516, 518 (9th Cir. 1992). "
1194,7," Mr. Taylor's discussion of § 727(a)(4)(A) only addresses the materiality of the false statements. Mr. Taylor waives any other 
arguments with respect to § 727(a)(4)(A). See Christian Legal Soc. Chapter of Univ. of Cal. v. Wu, 626 F.3d 483, 487 (9th Cir. 
2010). He does not challenge the first, third, and fourth factors concerning the ""false oath,"" ""knowing,"" and ""fraudulent"" 
requirements. "
1195,8," Mr. Taylor cites a number of non-binding cases to support his argument that his false statements were immaterial. However, 
these cases are readily distinguishable and do not help Mr. Taylor's position. See Merena v. Merena (In re Merena), 413 B.R. 
792, 817 (Bankr. D. Mont. 2009), aff'd, 2009 Bankr. LEXIS 5531, 2009 WL 4914650 (9th Cir. BAP Dec. 10, 2009) (finding the 
omission of lawsuits immaterial, because, unlike the present case, they ""do not concern business dealings or the existence and 
disposition of [the debtor's] property""); Olympic Coast Inv., Inc. v. Wright (In re Wright), 364 B.R. 51, 75 (Bankr. D. Mont. 2007), 
aff'd, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3347, 2008 WL 160828 (D. Mont. Jan. 16, 2008), aff'd, 340 F. App'x 422 (9th Cir. 2009) (finding that 
the omission of business entities was not material because the businesses were all ""defunct or valueless"" and there was no 
evidence that ""the omitted assets had any value to the estate""); Sprague, Thall & Albert v. Woerner (In re Woerner), 66 B.R. 
964, 974 (Bankr. E.D. Pa. 1986) (holding that the debtor's omissions concerning his personal bank account were not material, 
where there was no evidence that funds were going in or out of the account). These cases are not relevant to the present case, 
where Mr. Taylor was still earning money and regularly caused substantial funds (including personal funds) to flow in and out of 
a concealed bank account in the name of a concealed business entity. "
1198,1," This allegation reads in full, ""Also, those Subject Taxi Companies that have been coerced not to do business with CMT have 
been significantly harmed by not having a competitive response to other e-hailing companies."" Am. Counterclaim ¶ 12 
(emphasis added). The Court presumes that this is an error and that Flywheel intends to state that the taxi companies ""have 
been coerced not to do business with Flywheel."" "

Defense. "
1208,2," ""Ferrules"" does not appear in claim 1. "
1217,3," 3M cited Ventana Medical Systems, Inc. v. Biogenex Laboratories, Inc., 473 F.3d 1173 (Fed. Cir. 2006), in its ""prosecution 
history"" argument. In Ventana, the Federal Circuit concluded that prosecution disclaimer did not apply because allegedly 
disclaiming statements were made with respect to claim language that differed from claim language in a descendant patent. 473 
F.3d at 1182. The court of appeals concluded that the prosecution history of the descendant patent supported a broad 
construction of the disputed claim term. Id. at 1182-83. That construction was consistent with the specification. Id. at 1180 (""In 
this case, Ventana argues that there is nothing in the record to suggest that a person of ordinary skill in the art would interpret 
the disclosure and claims of the '861 patent to mean that the term 'dispensing' is limited to 'direct dispensing.' We agree.""). "
1218,4," 3M asserted claims 7, 14, 20, 21, 33, 47, 72, 86, and 106 of the '157 Patent against Moldex Metric."

No. 06-4829, Dkt. No. 1. On April 25, 2007, I denied defendants' motion seeking to dismiss the conspiracy to monopolize claim 
set forth therein. See Id. at Dkt. No. 13 (E.D. Pa. Apr. 25, 2007)."
1235,5," M.D. Basciani did not seek reconsideration of that decision at the time it was rendered, but essentially asks for reconsideration 
of it now."
1235,6," Whether plaintiffs' conspiracy to monopolize claim is limited to those damages accruing after October 27, 2002, the date four 
years prior to the date on which the Katsiroubas complaint was filed, remains an open question. There is a split of authority with 
respect to whether the initial class claims and any newly-filed claims must be identical in order to commence tolling under 
American Pipe. See In re Cmty. Bank of N. Va., 622 F.3d 275, 299 (3d Cir. 2010) (noting a ""competing line of authority"" on the 
question of whether ""class action tolling only applies to claims that are identical to those asserted in the initial class action,"" but 
not ruling on the issue). "
1236,7," M.D. Basciani does not argue that there is insufficient overlap between Giant Eagle's Ohio Valentine Act claim and the matters 
considered in the DOJ action."
1236,8," The Ohio Valentine Act is absent from this list. Specifically, 15 U.S.C. § 12 provides that: ""Antitrust laws,"" as used herein, includes the Act entitled ""An Act to protect trade and commerce against unlawful restraints 
and monopolies,"" approved July second, eighteen hundred and ninety; sections seventy-three to seventy-six, inclusive, of 
an Act entitled ""An Act to reduce taxation, to provide [*38]  revenue for the Government, and for other purposes,"" of August 
twenty-seventh, eighteen hundred and ninety-four; an Act entitled ""An Act to amend sections seventy-three and seventy-six 
of the Act of August twenty-seventh, eighteen hundred and ninety-four, entitled 'An Act to reduce taxation, to provide 
revenue for the Government, and for other purposes,'"" approved February twelfth, nineteen hundred and thirteen; and also 
this Act. "
1237,9," The Donnelly Act's tolling provision provides that Whenever any civil or criminal proceeding is instituted by the federal government to prevent, restrain, or punish violations of 
the federal antitrust laws, the running of the period of limitations in respect of every right of action arising under sections 
three hundred forty, three hundred forty-two and three hundred forty-two-a of this article, based in whole or in part on any 
matter complained of in the federal proceeding, shall be suspended during the pendency of said proceeding and for one 
year thereafter . . . . N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law § 342—c. "
1238,10," Indeed, I considered Dr. Lopez's arguments in weighing M.D. Basciani's motion to exclude the report and testimony of 
plaintiffs expert, Professor Einer Ethauge. Because I ultimately denied M.D. Basciani's motion to exclude Professor Elhauge, see 
Dkt. Nos. 693, 694, 718, 719, its argument that ""Professor Elhauge's reports must be stricken because he is not qualified to 
render the opinions he offers . . ."" is moot. Dkt. No. 554 at 10. "
1240,11," More fully, the Areeda and Hovenkamp Antitrust Law treatise explains that: Purchase (or leases) of real property would normally lie outside of § 7 concern. To buy office or plant space is 
certainly [*49]  to acquire an asset, but it is not ordinarily of any more antitrust concern than buying ordinary goods or 
services necessary for one's operations. This is clearest when equivalent properties are readily available to others'; central-
city office space seems an obvious example. Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law ¶ 1202e (2d ed., 2000)."
1240,12," Again, more fully, the Antitrust Law treatise explains that: In some exceptional cases a real estate transfer represents the loss of a [*50]  going concern and the transfer of market 
share from one firm to a former competitor. An example might be the sale by a marketer of all of its merchandising sites to 
a rival marketer . . . . Real property is also a § 7 ""asset"" when the acquisition concerns a limited supply of the very subject matter of subsequent 
competition. Consider, for example, the acquisition of a large office building by an interstate area's major owner of existing 
office buildings and land. Such additional control over supply of real estate sold or rented might well enhance the buyer's 
market power. This consolidation of control in the market for the disposition of real estate is within concern [of § 7], and its 
effects would be tested by the usual antimerger standards. Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law ¶ 12020 (3d ed., 2006). "
1241,13," Plaintiffs argue that the farms targeted by the EMMC would have been valuable to competitor mushroom farms since they 
were already zoned for the production of mushrooms. Dkt. No. 539 at 21-22; see Dkt No. 536, Ex. 15 (article from ""The Produce 
News"" explaining that ""[i]t is very difficult to get permits to put in a new mushroom farm.""); Dkt. No. 536, Ex. 7 (Leffler Rpt.) 
(""Because mushrooms are grown using composted manure, significant odor, fly, and compost disposal issues occur. As a result 
there are a few properly zone properties available to grow mushrooms. The lack of zoning results in barriers to entry into the 
mushroom market.""). They contend that ""[t]he purchase of such valuable assets to keep them out of the hands of competitors is 
precisely the kind of conduct targeted by Section 7."" Dkt. No. 539 at 21-22."
1241,14," M.D. Basciani also argues that to the extent that it ""viewed the monies paid as an investment in real estate, it cannot be held 
liable under Section 7 of the Clayton Act as a matter of law."" Dkt. No. 518 (Mem. at 15). In support of its argument, it cites 
Pennsylvania Railroad Company v. Interstate Commerce Commission, which held that the ""provisions of section 7 of the act 
prohibiting the acquisition of the stock of one corporation engaged in commerce by another so engaged do not apply if the stock 
is purchased 'solely for investment' . . . ."" 66 F.2d 37, 39 (3d Cir. 1933), aff'd sub nom. Interstate Coat. Comm'n v. Pa. R Co, 
291 U.S. 651, 54 S. Ct. 559, 78 L. Ed. 1045, (1934). I do not here answer the question of whether a purchase of real estate (and 
not stock) made solely for investment purposes could be subject to liability under Section 7. Even assuming, arguendo that it 
could not, I find that material questions of fact remain with respect to the question of whether M.D. Basciani made payments 
toward the EMMC's property acquisitions solely for the purposes of investment. Summary judgment is not warranted on the 
basis of this argument. See, e.g. United States v. E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 353 U.S. 586, 647 n.29, 77 S. Ct. 872, 1 L. 
Ed. 2d 1057 (1957) (explaining that ""whether any stock purchase is an investment turns largely on the intent of the purchaser"" 
and overturning the District Court's finding that du Pont purchased General Motors' stock solely for investment on the basis of 
evidence that it also may have been du Pont's purpose to secure a noncompetitive preference)."
1241,15," Defendants made a similar argument in the context of an earlier motion to dismiss in this litigation. They argued ""that as a 
matter of law a member, affiliate or officer of a cooperative cannot be held liable under Section 7 for the cooperative's 
acquisitions because mere membership in an agricultural cooperative, like mere stock ownership in a corporation, should not 
and does not give rise to Section 7 liability."" In re Mushroom Direct Purchaser Antitrust Litig., 514 F. Supp. 2d 683, 703 (E.D. Pa. 
2007) (alterations and internal quotation omitted). I denied the motion to dismiss, finding that plaintiffs were entitled to offer 
evidence with respect to the ""precise nature of the acquisitions in this case and the corresponding roles of the member 
defendants."" Id. at 704. "
1243,16," The Supreme Court specified that a failing corporation is one ""with resources so depleted and the prospect of rehabilitation so 
remote that it faced the grave probability of a business failure with resulting loss to its stockholders and injury to the communities 
where its plants were operated . . . ."" Int'l Shoe, 280 U.S. at 302. "
1244,1," In reaching this decision, the Court considered the following: (1) Defendant M.D. Basciani & Sons, Inc. motion for summary 
judgment, Dkt. No. 518; (2) the joinder of defendants Brownstone Mushroom Farm; To-Jo Fresh Mushrooms, Inc.; Country 
Fresh Mushroom Co.; Gino Gaspari & Sons, Inc.; Kaolin Mushroom Farms, Inc.; South Mill Mushroom Farms, Inc.; Southmill 
Mushroom Sales, Inc.; Modern Mushroom Farms, Inc.; C&C Carriage Mushroom Co.; Sher-Rockee Mushroom Farm, LLC; 
Oakshire Mushroom Farm, Inc.; Phillips Mushroom Farms, Inc.; Louis M. Marson, Jr., Inc.; Monterey Mushrooms, Inc.; and John 
Pia in M.D. Basciani's motion to the extent that it relates to plaintiffs' claims against them under Section 7 of the Clayton Act, Dkt. 
No. 519; (3) the joinder of defendant JM Farms, Dkt. No. 522; (4) defendant M. Cutone's response in support of the motion, Dkt. 
No. 525; (5) plaintiffs' opposition, Dkt. No. 539; (6) plaintiffs' appendix in support of their opposition to the motion, Dkt. No. 536; 
(7) M.D. Basciani's reply, Dkt. No. 554; (8) M.D. Basciani's sur-reply, Dkt. No. 565; (9) M.D. Basciani's supplemental sur-reply, 
Dkt. No. 716; (10) plaintiff's response thereto, Dkt. No. 720; and (11) the parties arguments with respect to the motion at oral 
argument, Dkt. No. 768. "
1254,1," Regency has suggested that this requirement is particularly egregious because students are notified of the requirement only 
after admission. But although a ""handful"" of students each year ""fell through the cracks"" and decided to live at the Regency, 
there is nothing in the record to suggest that these students did so based on UCD's failure to inform. Rather, UCD publicized the 
requirement on its website and reached out to all affected students from the requirement's inception. "
1259,2," Salco also cited United States v. Consolidated Laundries Corp., 291 F.2d 563 (2d Cir. 1961). However, Consolidated Laundries 
also traces its rule back to Yellow Cab. Id. at 573 (""But where the charge is conspiracy to monopolize, the essential element is 
not the power, but the specific intent, to monopolize. Section 2 makes it unlawful 'to conspire to monopolize ""any part"" of 
interstate commerce, without specifying how large a part must be affected. Hence it is enough if some appreciable part of 
interstate commerce is the subject' of the conspiracy."" (quoting Yellow Cab, 332 U.S. at 225-26)). "
1260,3," The Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Grinnell Corp., 384 U.S. 563, 86 S. Ct. 1698, 16 L. Ed. 2d 778 (1966), 
reinforces this point by reading the ""any part"" language in the Act as a reference to the relevant market requirement. In Grinnell, 
the government charged several alarm and protective services businesses with violations of §§ 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. The 
district court accepted the market definition of ""the accredited central protective service business,"" which was a conglomeration 
of the defendants' services. See United States v. Grinnell Corp., 236 F. Supp. 244, 249 (D.R.I. 1964), aff'd in part, rev'd in part, 
384 U.S. 563, 86 S. Ct. 1698, 16 L. Ed. 2d 778 (1966). The defendants challenged that market definition on certiorari, but the 
Supreme Court affirmed. The Court explained that the market for reasonably interchangeable goods ""make[s] up that 'part' of 
trade or commerce which § 2 protects against monopoly power."" Id. at 571. In other words, the ""any part"" language from § 2 
speaks to the relevant market (reasonably interchangeable goods), and is not simply a requirement that a defendant's actions 
impact some appreciable amount of interstate commerce. Although the Court made this statement in describing the elements of 
""[t]he offense of monopoly under § 2,"" id. at 570, it affirmed the district court's definition of the relevant market as to all of the 
government's § 2 claims, including conspiracy. See id. at 570-73; 236 F. Supp. at 257. "
1261,4," See Earl W. Kintner et al., Federal Antitrust Law § 16.39 (2d ed. 2015) (""[A]fter the Supreme Court's decision in Spectrum

] Sales of price-fixed products are not a necessary element of a violative price-fixing conspiracy. ""[I]t is . . . well settled that conspiracies under the Sherman Act are not dependent on any overt act other than the act of conspiring. It is the contract, 
combination or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce which [Section] 1 of the Act strikes down, whether the concerted 
activity be wholly nascent or abortive on the one hand, or successful on the other."" Socony-Vacuum Oil, 310 U.S. at 224 n.59

(in a ""conspiracy to fix prices for violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act, the agreement itself constitutes the complete offense""), 
aff'd, 65 F.3d 4 (2d Cir. 1995). Additional overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy are not needed. "
1286,8," This understanding of the Circuit's observation is consistent with this Court's comments in LIBOR III and LIBOR IV about the 
motivations of defendants, rejecting as implausible any suggestion that defendants engaged in the persistent suppression of 
LIBOR to increase transactional profits. E.g., LIBOR III, 27 F. Supp. 3d at 469 (""[I]t is implausible that all defendants would 
maintain parallel trading positions . . . across the Class Period and that those positions, in turn, motivated their daily LIBOR 
submissions. . . . The far more likely explanation is that, to the extent all defendants engaged in parallel manipulation of LIBOR, 
the conduct was motivated by reputational concerns, not by the banks' positions . . . ."") (internal alterations omitted). To be clear, 
what we have found plausible is that defendants engaged in trader-based manipulation were motivated by the prospect of 
increased profits. E.g., LIBOR IV, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 147561, 2015 WL 6243526, at *6 (""[I]ndividual traders received money, 
promotions, and adulation based on their personal profit and loss. To gain profits or avoid losses, therefore, a trader would 
sometimes ask his bank's LIBOR submitter to engage in what we call trader-based manipulation. The submitter would send a 
false quote in whichever currency and tenor suited the trader's book.""). Profit-motivated trader-based manipulation, which was 
sporadic and would result in both the inflation and deflation of LIBOR submissions, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 147561, [WL] at *32, 
has nothing to do with the persistent suppression conspiracy that is at issue in the antitrust claims, Gelboim, 823 F.3d at 764."

at http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324442304578231721272636626.html ). The cited article describes profits 
made not on LIBOR suppression but rather on ""trades pegged to the interest rates"" such as bets regarding ""the gap between 
different rates related to Libor and the euro interbank offered rate"" and ""each hundredth of a percentage point that the three-
month U.S. dollar Libor increased compared with the one-month U.S. dollar Libor."""

funding mix, generally included more longer-term and more fixed-rate instruments, suppression of LIBOR would tend to reduce

contribute to increasing, maintaining, or mitigating deterioration of their net interest margins.""); Freddie Mac Compl. ¶ 89 (""During 
this time, many of the Bank Defendants were net borrowers, meaning that they financially benefited from reductions in short-
term interest rates."")."
1287,13," After oral argument, plaintiffs submitted an academic paper that suggested that ""banks mostly take pay-floating positions in 
interest-rate derivatives, which are positions that gain in value from a surprise fall in interest rates."" Carmody Letter 2, ECF No. 
1638. As plaintiffs acknowledge, the study relates only to U.S. banks, id. at 2 n.3; the study examines interest rates generally, 
not LIBOR specifically; and LIBOR suppression does not mean that LIBOR experienced a surprise fall, only that LIBOR was 
lower than it otherwise would have been. The paper therefore does not save plaintiffs' theory. "
1288,14," Two prominent economists tasked with reforming LIBOR came to the same conclusion about the motivations for LIBOR 
manipulation. See Darrell Duffie & Jeremy C. Stein, Reforming LIBOR and Other Financial Market Benchmarks, 29 J. Econ. 
Persp. 191, 191 (2015) (""Banks had incentives to announce biased interest rates, for two reasons. First, in times of economic 
stress, reporting a lower interest rate would signal that the bank is more creditworthy, all else equal. Second, some of the bank's 
trading positions would be more profitable if LIBOR could be pushed one way or the other, depending on the position taken.""). "

concluding that persistent suppression was not designed to 'benefit Defendants' trading position' and 'it did not stand to reason, 
that foreign defendants aimed their manipulative conduct at the United States or any particular forum state,' Plaintiffs respectfully 
submit that this Court's conclusions on data fraud do not apply to the antitrust allegations that Defendants had a 'common motive 
to conspire' to suppress USD LIBOR for 'increased profits,' Gelboim, 823 F.3d at 781-82. Viewed in that light, Plaintiffs satisfy 
every element of the Calder analysis for their antitrust claims."" Pls.' Joint Mem. of Law in Opp'n 14-15 (internal alterations

1291,17," For example, plaintiffs allege, ""In a 2007 internal email sent to Barclays' former CEO Robert Diamond, BCI [Barclays Capital 
Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Barclays] Director and Executive Officer Jerry del Missier, who was based in New York, wrote 
that the USD LIBOR submissions for all of the Panel Banks were 'fantasy rates.' Del Missier has admitted that he instructed

that the direction to submit low LIBOR rates came from CEO Bob Diamond, not from Del Missier. Id. (""In evidence to MPs 
following his resignation as chief operating officer of Barclays, Del Missier was adamant that Diamond instructed him to cut the 
Libor rate following a conversation with Paul Tucker, deputy governor of the Bank of England. . . . Asked if he was acting on an

1291,18," Carmody Letter 1, Oct. 20, 2016, ECF No. 1600. Plaintiffs also rely on the testimony of former Rabobank trader Takayuki 
Yagami, even though Yagami traded products tied to Yen LIBOR. Id. at 2. We do not understand plaintiffs' continued, stubborn 
refusal to comply with our simple admonition that only allegations pertaining to USD LIBOR are potentially relevant to this case. 
LIBOR IV, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 147561, 2015 WL 6243526, at *45 (""We continue to reject the impermissible inference that 
defendants' reprehensible behavior in one product (or even many products: Yen LIBOR, TIBOR, Swiss Franc LIBOR, EURIBOR, 
. . . and so on) suffices to overcome deficiencies in the pleading of actionable bad behavior in USD LIBOR."")."
1291,19," Stewart's statement itself suggests that he lacked personal knowledge: ""I also understand that someone at Rabobank, first in 
London and later in Utrecht, would submit a Rabobank LIBOR rate each day to Thom[]son Reuters in New York by means of an 
electronic wire submission."" Stewart Tr. at 15:3-6 (emphasis added). "
1292,20, See supra note 1. 
1294,21," We firmly reject plaintiffs' attempt to spin their own appeal as a ""tactical choice"" by the defendants ""to take the merits up on 
appeal . . . by affirmatively asking the Second Circuit . . . to affirm on the merits,"" OTC Pls.' Suppl. Mem. of Law in Opp'n 5. 
Defendants, of course, were not the appellants."
1294,22," Plaintiffs argue that the Bondholder case returned to the district court between the Second Circuit's dismissal in October 2013 
and the Bondholder plaintiffs' appeal to the Supreme Court in March 2014, and so the defendants should have raised the 
defense then. Bondholder Pls.' Supp. Mem. in Opp'n 2-3, ECF No. 1499. This argument is beyond comprehension. Until the 
Supreme Court granted certiorari in June 2014, there simply was no Bondholder case: it had been dismissed in the district court 
and dismissed in the Second Circuit. Plaintiffs would have us create a rule requiring defendants to raise defenses in cases that 
do not exist. "
1295,23," This ruling applies equally to defendant UBS, which did not waive its personal jurisdiction defense as to the antitrust claims 
when it consented to personal jurisdiction in New York as to other claims. Sunward Elecs., Inc. v. McDonald, 362 F.3d 17, 24 (2d 
Cir. 2004) (a plaintiff ""must establish the court's jurisdiction with respect to each claim asserted"") (emphasis in original). Similarly, defendants without New York branches did not forfeit their personal jurisdictional defense in failing to assert the 
defense in 2012. As defendants point out, Daimler cast significant doubt on other avenues of establishing personal jurisdiction, 
such as the Second Circuit's theory of jurisdiction under Wiwa v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., 226 F.3d 88 (2d Cir. 2000). See 
Sonera Holding B.V. v. Cukurova Holding A.S., 750 F.3d 221, 224-26 (2d Cir. 2014). "
1296,24," There exists a circuit split on whether umbrella purchasers have antitrust standing. Gelboim, 823 F.3d at 778. Among the 
district courts there seems to be broader agreement: ""The overwhelming majority of recent court decisions that have addressed 
the viability of the 'umbrella' theory after [AGC] have rejected 'umbrella' claims."" In re Vitamins Antitrust Litig., No. 99CIV5134, 
2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12114, 2001 WL 855463, at *4 (D.D.C. July 2, 2001). "
1297,25," There remains an open question about the treatment of plaintiffs who transacted with a subsidiary or affiliate of a panel bank. 
We do not resolve that question here, but note that the parties should consider this question at the class certification stage."
1297,26," We reject plaintiffs' attempt to turn the question of market control into a question of ""price control . . . over . . . the entire 
Eurodollar futures market by virtue of their authorship of LIBOR,"" Exchange-Based Pls.' Mem. of Law in Opp'n 7, ECF No. 1504. 
The thrust of the umbrella purchaser concept is to distinguish between those plaintiffs who dealt with price-fixing defendants 
directly and other plaintiffs whose prices were affected by price-fixing defendants' actions. Plaintiffs' approach would nullify the 
causation question in all antitrust cases."
1297,27," The Court was not informed of this fact until defendants' letter of December 2, 2016, which is particularly striking given the 
Court's question on this very issue at oral argument on October 27, 2016. Tr. 102:22-103:14 (""THE COURT: How many large 
traders are there all together[?] . . . [I]f there were 400 large traders and there are 16 banks, the percentage is low in terms of the 
analysis that was utilized in FOREX. That's what I am trying to learn. [COUNSEL FOR EXCHANGE-BASED PLAINTIFFS]: We 
don't know what the percentage is. It may be low [], it might not be low.""). "
1299,28," Although the Bondholder class -- comprised of plaintiffs who did not transact directly from defendants -- is dismissed under the 
first factor of causation, there remain plaintiffs within the OTC class who allege that they purchased bonds directly from 
defendants, such as plaintiff SEIU. The analysis in this section pertains to such plaintiffs."
1299,29," The Schwab plaintiffs submitted declarations arguing the following: I do not agree that [LIBOR suppression] would have somehow been reflected in a lower price to the Treasury Entities, 
thereby compensating them. In initial offerings the Treasury Entities simply bought at par. In secondary markets the 
Treasury Entities sometimes bought at a discount or premium to par -- but any discount or premium would have reflected 
underlying changes in interest rates or credit-worthiness of the issuer, not 'compensation' for LIBOR suppression. Whether 
in the primary or secondary market, Schwab overpaid for the investments; the suppression of LIBOR systematically caused 
the risk of the investment to be understated compared to the interest rate being offered and reduced the Treasury Entities' 
income. Decl. of Dennis Goldman ¶ 10, ECF No. 1512. "
1300,," Whether a bond is purchased at par value is immaterial to the question of whether the purchase price is equal to the present 
value of the expected payments. Purchasing a new-issue bond at par simply means that the future payments are set at a level 
that reflects a present value of par. As to the secondary market, it would seem that the point of the Schwab plaintiffs is the same 
as our point: a discount or premium on the purchase price ""reflect[s] underlying changes in interest rates,"" such as LIBOR 
suppression."
1300,30," The named plaintiffs of the proposed OTC class only purchased interest rate swaps, but the OTC complaint lists other types of 
instruments on which it would sue on behalf of the class. The instruments ""include but are not limited to asset swaps, 
collateralized debt obligations, credit default swaps, forward rate agreements, inflation swaps, interest rate swaps, total return 
swaps, and options."" OTC Compl. ¶ 35. "
1301,31," Plaintiffs also rely heavily on New York v. Hendrickson Brothers, Inc., 840 F.2d 1065 (2d Cir. 1988), which said that ""antitrust 
treble-damage actions should not be complicated by a need to trace the effects of the overcharge with respect to such matters 
as prices, costs, and the potentially different behavior of all the pertinent variables in the absence of the overcharges."" Id. at 
1079. Plaintiffs use this quotation out of context. The court in Hendrickson was explaining why indirect purchasers are routinely 
denied antitrust standing --that is, because allowing recovery by indirect purchasers would require courts to trace all of the 
effects of an overcharge."

1302,33," There is little reason to believe that the graphs are mislabeled. Although the complaint provides no information as to the 
source of the data in the graphs, publicly available data suggests that the date labels are correct. See, e.g., Federal Reserve

1304,34," The Ninth Circuit noted that antitrust standing is more permissive under Cartwright Act claims than under federal law in that 
the Cartwright Act permits suits by both direct and indirect purchasers. Knevelbaard Dairies, 232 F.3d at 987, 991. That fact 
does not impact the analysis in this case. "
1310,1," Indirect purchasers include entities that sell products containing LCD panels and the consumers that ultimately buy the 
products."
1310,2," Consisting of Toshiba Corp., Toshiba America Electronic Components, Inc., Toshiba Mobile Display Co., and Toshiba America 
Information Systems, Inc."
1310,3," Defendants who are named in the State's Complaint but have subsequently settled include the AU Optronics Defendants (AU 
Optronics Corp, and AU Optronics Corp. America, Inc.), the Chi Mei Defendants (Chimei Innolux Corp., Chimei Optoelectronics 
USA, Inc., and CMO Japan Co., Ltd.), the Epson Defendants (Epson Imaging Devices Corp., and Epson Electronics America, 
Inc.), the Hitachi Defendants (Hitachi, Ltd., Hitachi Displays, Ltd., Hitachi America, Ltd., and Hitachi Electronic Devices USA, 
Inc.), the LG Defendants (LG Display Co., Ltd., LG Display American, Inc.), the Samsung Defendants (Samsung Electronics Co., 
Ltd., Samsung Electronics America, Inc., and Samsung Semiconductor, Inc.), and the Sharp Defendants (Sharp Corp., and 
Sharp Electronics Corp.). "
1311,4," 740 ILCS 10/11 expressly directs Illinois courts to look to federal law for guidance where the wording of the IAA is ""identical or 
similar to that of a federal antitrust law."" See discussion at page 14, infra. "
1312,5," The one-page draft order submitted by the State with that motion, which was never entered, proposed no findings with respect 
to the nature of any claim or the applicability of the statute, but merely listed twelve specific affirmative defenses to be ""stricken 
with prejudice."" "
1313,6," The motion also made the same argument addressed by the Court's January 20, 2016, memorandum opinion, that application 
of the IAA to such sales was barred by the Commerce Clause of the United States' Constitution. The Court noted in its 
subsequent opinion that this portion of Defendants' argument was mooted by the Court's January 20, 2016, ruling on the later-
filed motion by the State to strike certain Defendants' affirmative defenses which were purportedly based upon the Commerce 
Clause. See Memorandum Opinion and Order dated April 18, 2016, at 7. "
1316,7," See discussion at pages 33-34 , infra, for more on the legislative history of FTAIA. "
1317,8," See page 30, infra, for a discussion of the facts in Empagran. "
1318,9," The Animal Science court also overturned both Turicentro and Carpet Group to the extent that those cases had treated FTAIA 
as a jurisdictional bar rather than a substantive element of a claim based on conduct involving foreign trade or commerce. 
Animal Sci. Prods., 654 F.3d at 467-68. "
1319,10," The Sherman Act, unlike the IAA, does not expressly authorize actions by indirect purchasers. See Motorola Mobility LLC, 775 
F.3d at 821 (citing Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720 (1977)). "
1322,11," This Act shall not apply to conduct involving trade or commerce (other than import trade or import commerce) with foreign 
nations unless-- (1) such conduct has a direct, substantial, and reasonably foreseeable effect-- (A) on trade or commerce which is not trade or commerce with foreign nations, or on import trade or import commerce 
with foreign nations; or (B) on export trade or export commerce with foreign nations, of a person engaged in such trade or commerce in the 
United States[.]"
1322,15, U.S.C. § 6a(1); see also 740 ILCS 10/5(14)(a)(i) and (ii).
1322,12," See Empagran S.A., 542 U.S. at 162 (explaining that FTAIA's ""technical language initially lays down a general rule placing all 
(nonimport) activity involving foreign commerce outside the Sherman Act's reach."" (emphasis added). "
1323,13," ""This Act shall not apply to conduct involving trade or commerce (other than import trade or import commerce) with foreign 
nations..."" 15 U.S.C. § 6a; see also 740 ILCS 10/5(14)."
1323,14," The Court further explained that, during the drafting process, the House Judiciary Committee changed the language of the 
opening phrase from saying that the Act would not apply to ""conduct involving exports"" to say instead that the Act would not 
apply to ""trade or commerce (other than import trade or import commerce)."" Empagran S.A., 542 U.S. at 162. The Court pointed 
out that the legislature made this change ""deliberately to include commerce that did not involve American exports but which was 
wholly foreign."" Id. "
1325,15," The State also argued that a case cited by Toshiba from the Sixth Circuit, Carrier Corporation v. Outokumpu Oyj, 673 F.3d 
430 (6th Cir. 2012), was inapposite to the instant suit. Carrier involved an alleged price fixing scheme for copper tubing used in 
air conditioning and refrigeration equipment. This Court agrees with the State that Carrier is of little persuasive effect here 
because plaintiff's claim in that case did not involve foreign commerce at all. Id. at 438, n. 3. The Court notes, however, that in 
explaining what FTAIA was, the Carrier court defined import commerce as ""transactions in which the seller is located abroad 
while the buyer is domestic and the goods flow into the United States,"" which is consistent with this Court's analysis."
1325,16," Except for approximately 3% of the commerce in question involving direct sales, as further discussed at pages 41-42, infra. It 
is not disputed that FTAIA is inapplicable to those sales."
1325,17, Except as described in note 16. 
1326,18," Animal Science has also been criticized for its failure to use the distinctive terms ""import exclusion"" and ""import exception"" to 
reference the provisions in the Parenthetical and the Effects Exceptions of FTAIA, respectively. Instead, it refers to both as 
""exceptions."" Id. at 854. The Seventh Circuit took issue with this terminology in Minn-Chem, calling it ""not an accurate 
description,"" and replacing the term exception when quoting Animal Science in the context of what Minn-Chem and other courts 
deem the ""exclusion"" in the Parenthetical. Minn-Chem, Inc., 683 F.3d at 854, 858. Therefore it is not always clear, particularly in 
subsequent citations to Animal Science, which ""exception"" is being referenced. See, e.g., Maricultura DelNorte, S. de R.L. de C. 
V. v. World Bus. Capital, Inc., 159 F. Supp. 3d 368, 382 (S.D.N.Y. 2015). "
1329,1, Defendants allege that they are residents of Texas. 
1332,1," Recently, Plaintiffs have moved (doc. #156) to sever Plaintiff Rafael de la Cruz's Nevada minimum wage claim (Count VII in the 
TAC) and transfer it to the District of Nevada. As explained in more detail below, the court will address that motion by separate 
order."
1332,2," Defendant Martin Auza Sheep Company (""Auza""); Defendant Cunningham Sheep Company (""Cunningham""); Defendant 
Nottingham Land and Livestock, LLLP (""Nottingham"") and Two Bar Sheep Co., LLC (""Two Bar""); and Defendant Dennis Richins 
d/b/a Dennis Richins Livestock (""Richins""). Plaintiffs have dismissed three other ranches. "
1333,3," Plaintiffs filed the entirety of doc. #139 and its attachments under seal. Within seven days, Plaintiffs shall confer and file a 
motion to restrict that complies with D.C.COLO.LCivR 7.2 regarding that filing. "
1334,4," Plaintiffs allege that five Defendants paid above minimum wage: MPAS, Auza, Two Bar, Cunningham, and Nottingham. Id. at 
¶¶ 186-204. They further allege that four nonparty ranches paid above minimum wage. Id. at ¶¶ 205-209. However, Plaintiffs 
also allege generically that ""Defendants"" paid above the minimum wage. Id. at e.g., ¶¶ 85, 86, 214, 215. Whether the group 
allegation suffices is questionable. See, e.g., Compliance Mktg., v. Drugtest, Inc., Case No. 09-cv-1241-JLK, 2010 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 34315, 2010 WL 1416823, at *6 (D. Colo. Apr. 7, 2010) (""generalized allegations of agreements ... do not provide 
sufficient factual basis to demonstrate concerted action""). For argument's sake, the court assumes that all Defendants paid 
above minimum wage."
1334,5," Plaintiffs generally assume that Defendants paid wages that they did not offer, and the court will assume this is true. However, 
two paragraphs differ: Plaintiff Leovegildo Vilchez Guerra alleges that he was offered above the minimum wage that Defendants 
represented to DOL as the offer. TAC at ¶ 221. Plaintiffs also allege that Defendants ""intended to offer"" above the minimum 
wage to foreign shepherds (TAC at ¶ 85), implying that they did so. If Defendants offered varying compensation to foreign 
shepherds, regardless of whether that information was disclosed to DOL, that fact alone would contradict Plaintiffs' remaining 
theory of conspiracy. "
1335,6, The court does not reach whether any Defendants actually violated DOL regulations.
1335,7," Plaintiffs also contend that the regulatory environment is relevant only if there is a ""showing of clear repugnancy"" with the 
Sherman Act sufficient to show immunity. Doc. #152 at p. 10 (citing Nat'l Gerimedical Hosp. & Gerontology Ctr. V. Blue Cross, 
452 U.S. 378, 388-89, 101 S. Ct. 2415, 69 L. Ed. 2d 89 (1981)). Twombly demonstrates that the regulatory environment is 
relevant to the plausibility of the alleged conspiracy, regardless of whether it also meets the standard for implied immunity. "
1336,8," Plaintiffs also argue that the law may be ""evolving"" because a petition for certiorari was granted regarding Osborn v. Visa Inc., 
797 F.3d 1057, 418 U.S. App. D.C. 193 (D.C. Cir. 2015). Doc. #139 at pp. 6-7. The petition was later dismissed as improvidently 
granted. Visa v. Osborn, 137 S. Ct. 289, 196 L. Ed. 2d 396, 2016 WL 6808590, at *1 (U.S. Nov. 17, 2016)."
1336,9," As discussed below, Plaintiffs allege that MPAS and WRA directed members to offer the minimum wage in correspondence 
and a handbook excerpt attached to the TAC, but the documents do not support the contention."
1336,10," Plaintiffs argue that 29 U.S.C. § 1801 et seq. is irrelevant because it regards only recruitment of migrant or seasonal U.S. 
agricultural workers, not H-2A workers. Doc. #139 (Motion) at p. 8 (referring to Plaintiffs' objections, Doc. #131, at pp. 7-8). 
Excepting foreign workers, ""the term 'migrant agricultural worker' means an individual who is employed in agricultural 
employment of a seasonal or other temporary nature, and who is required to be absent overnight from his permanent place of 
residence."" 29 U.S.C. § 1802(8)(A). The domestic job orders appear to fall within this definition. "
1337,11," Defendants argue that the ""attachments to the Second Amended Complaint had revealed [this] all along."" Doc. #148 at p. 11. 
In earlier briefing, Defendants did not rely on this argument until MPAS's reply. Doc. #91 (Motion) at p. 3 n.3; Doc. #105 (Reply) 
at p. 3. The court recommended dismissal without reaching this issue."
1337,12," As to WRA and its members, the attachments to the TAC do not appear to show variation in the compensation offered. See, 
e.g., Doc. #139-3 at pp. 12, 26; Doc. #139-4 at pp. 12, 21; Doc. #139-5 at p. 5; Doc. #139-6 at pp. 17, 40, 64, 76. Whether WRA 
and its members varied the offered compensation would be a fact issue to resolve later if any of the antitrust claims were 
plausible."
1337,13," The MPAS H-2A applications attached to the TAC appear to offer foreign shepherds only the minimum wage. See, e.g., Doc. 
#139-6 at pp. 2-12, 30, 53, 92. Yet, in opposing the motions to dismiss, Plaintiffs recognized that ""in a free market, Ranchers 
would offer U.S. workers more not less than foreign workers."" Doc. #96 at p. 23, n.7. If any of the antitrust claims against MPAS 
were plausible, its offered compensation to foreign shepherds would be a fact issue. "
1338,14," The Tenth Circuit does not appear to have addressed whether an industry-wide list price suggests an agreement to fix prices. 
Cf., In re Urethane Antitrust Litig., 768 F.3d 1245, 1264 (10th Cir. 2014) (only assuming ""[f]or the sake of argument ... that 
evidence of parallel price-increase announcements would not establish a price-fixing conspiracy""). "
1339,15," Plaintiffs refer to this document, Doc. #139-11, Ex. F at pp. 3-4, as both an attestation and as WRA's form contract with 
shepherds. TAC at e.g., ¶¶ 127-135, 246(iv), 247(iv). The court presumes both allegations to be true at this phase. "
1340,16," Plaintiffs also attach two sets of comments filed by WRA and/or MPAS in DOL rulemaking proceedings. Doc. #139-11 at pp. 
17-56, #139-12 at pp. 117-61. Plaintiffs allege those comments only with respect to other issues, not as factual support for the 
alleged conspiracy. TAC at ¶¶ 160, 240, 316-19. The court expressly does not reach whether any of the communications with 
government agencies are subject to immunity doctrines. "
1342,17," In the SAC, Plaintiffs alleged that H-2A shepherds were uniformly offered and paid no more than the minimum wage. The 
reasonable inference from those allegations was that the minimum wage had always sufficed for filling Defendants' jobs, 
regardless that other types of ranch workers earned more. Recommendation at pp. 6, 29, 32. "
1344,18," See also North Star, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 131684, 2016 WL 5358590, at *21 (""It is true that private civil actions under the 
state are being brought almost solely against legitimate defendants, rather than against the archetypal, intimidating mobster. Yet 
this defect — if defect it is — is inherent in the statute as written, and its correction must lie with Congress,"" quoting Odom v. 
Microsoft Corp., 486 F.3d 541, 553 (9th Cir. 2007)). "
1345,19," Richins also argues that circuits have differed regarding whether the Fair Labor Standards Act (""FLSA"") requires 
reimbursement of ""transportation costs for the departure."" Doc. #148 at p. 17. However, Plaintiffs do not allege that WRA 
misrepresented compliance with the FLSA. The FLSA also does not immunize WRA from the H-2A requirements but rather 
""applies independently of the H—2A requirements and imposes obligations on employers regarding payment of wages."" 20 
C.F.R. § 655.122(h)(1). "
1346,20," It further appears that Plaintiffs' counsel should have known already many of the facts that they propose to add as relevant to 
this claim, such as the specific amounts of unreimbursed expenses. TAC at ¶¶ 302-331."
1346,21," If the court did not find the proposed antitrust claims to be futile, Plaintiffs' delay in seeking to amend those claims would 
likewise give the court some pause. Plaintiffs assert that they are reacting to new theories raised recently by the Defendants and 
are adding facts obtained from discovery. Doc. #139 at 2; Doc. #152 (Reply) at 2. Yet, Plaintiffs were aware when they filed their 
earlier complaints that Defendants at times paid three of the Plaintiffs more than the minimum wage. TAC at ¶¶ 217, 221, 222. 
Plaintiffs also knew (or should have known) that the MPAS job orders attached to the SAC varied regarding the compensation 
offered, and other facts that they propose to add for these claims: MPAS's contract, doc. #139-11, Ex. F. at p. 2; and WRA's 
affidavit, Id. at p. 3. However, this is not entirely clear from the TAC's attachments. For instance, the affidavit that Plaintiff "
1347,," Leovegildo Vilchez Guerra signed for WRA is BATES stamped, but the TAC does not state who produced the document. Doc. 
#139-11, Ex. F at p. 3."
1347,22," The court has supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims because they are ""so related"" to the RICO claim against 
Richins that ""they form part of the same case or controversy under Article III of the United States Constitution."" 28 U.S.C. § 
1367(a). Count VIII regards the same facts as the RICO claim under common law theories. Count IX regards MPAS's same 
alleged illegal deductions from a different Plaintiff, Mr. De La Cruz. Counts VII and X regard rather different facts (MPAS's 
alleged failure to pay the Nevada minimum wage) but nonetheless appear so related that they form part of the same case and 
controversy. "
1348,23," All of the claims on which Plaintiff Rodolfo Llacua was named would be futile, as would all claims against the Ranch 
Defendants (Martin Auza Sheep Corporation, Cunningham Sheep Company, Dennis Richins Livestock, Nottingham Land and 
Livestock, LLLP; and Two Bar Sheep Co. LLC). This Recommendation would leave the remaining Plaintiffs to be Esliper 
Huaman, Leovegildo Vilchez Guerra, Liber Vilchez Guerra and Rafael de la Cruz; and the remaining Defendants would be WRA, 
MPAS and Dennis Richins. "
1350,1," Although the Motion to Dismiss was initially filed with respect to the First Amended Complaint (Doc. 11), on October 5, 2016, 
this Court ordered that the briefing on the Motion to Dismiss will be treated as briefing as to the Second Amended Complaint 
(ECF Doc. No. 46) (The Second Amended Complaint merely added additional parties and did not change the substance of the 
First Amended Complaint). All references and most citations to the complaint in this order will correspond with the paragraphs in 
the Second Amended Complaint. "
1351,2," These facts are set forth in Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint (ECF Doc. No. 46, ¶¶26-51)."
1351,3," In ¶¶ 3-31 of the Second Amended Complaint (Doc. 46), plaintiffs allege that their respective properties are within the 
""certificated boundaries"" of the Medina Storage Field. Defendant admitted these allegations, at least with respect to the parties 
in the First Amended Complaint. (Doc. 34, ¶3-24) However, plaintiffs later stated that the certificated boundaries are known only 
to FERC and the state of Ohio and otherwise maintained in secrecy. ECF Doc. No. 46, ¶46. Defendant admitted that FERC and 
the state of Ohio are provided maps showing the certificated boundaries of Columbia's Ohio storage fields and asserts that the 
maps are not available to the general public. ECF Doc. No. 34, ¶39. Thus, a reasonable inference from these allegations is that 
the Medina Landowners would not have known whether their properties were within the boundaries authorized by Columbia's 
FERC certificate. "
1352,4, The action was reassigned to Judge James S. Gwin after the retirement of Judge Wells. 
1353,5," Wilson v. Columbia Gas Transmission, LLC., 2:12-cv-1203, ECF Doc. No. 13."
1353,6," Columbia attempts to distinguish the Wilson court's denial of a similar motion to dismiss by asserting that the Wilson complaint 
left open the possibility of whether the landowners' properties in that case were within the FERC certificated boundaries whereas 
it asserts that the Medina Landowners, in this case, ""specifically allege that their property is within the Medina Storage Field."" 
ECF Doc. No. 44, Page ID# 729. The landowners in Wilson stated that ""upon information and belief"" their properties lie within "
1354,," the certificated boundaries of Columbia's natural gas storage field (12-1203, Doc. 2, ¶¶25-28). Here, the Medina Landowners did 
not use the ""upon information and belief"" qualification when they averred that their properties lie within the certificated 
boundaries of Columbia's natural gas storage field (Doc. 11, ¶¶3-24; Doc. 46. ¶¶3-31). However, the Medina Landowners also 
later asserted that they were unaware of the certificated boundaries of the storage fields because those borders are maintained 
by Columbia in secrecy -- a fact which Columbia admitted in its answer. (Doc. 46, ¶87 and Doc. 34, ¶39 ""Columbia admits that 
FERC and the State of Ohio are provided with maps showing the certificated boundaries of its Ohio storage fields. Columbia 
further admits that it does not make maps of its Ohio natural gas storage fields available to the general public."") Thus, although 
Columbia argues that the Medina Landowners ""specifically admit that their land lies within the boundaries of the Medina Storage 
Field"" this is not completely accurate. Viewing the Complaint as a whole, and considering Columbia's own admission that the 
certificated boundaries are maintained in secrecy, it is reasonable to infer that the certificated boundaries of the Medina Storage 
Field were not known to the landowners when they filed their amended complaint. "
1355,7," Columbia's reliance on this Court's post-Bowman decision in Arnholt is not persuasive. Columbia Gas Transmission Corp. v. 
An Exclusive Nat. Gas Storage Easement in Clinton Subterranean Geological Formation Beneath 80 Acres, Worthington Twp., 
Richland Cty., Ohio [""Arnholt""], 747 F. Supp. 401 (N.D. Ohio 1990). Arnholt is distinguishable from this matter in several ways 
(e.g., Arnholt was decided on a motion for summary judgment rather than a motion to dismiss; the landowners in Arnholt were 
permitted to amend their trespass claim to a claim for inverse condemnation — here Columbia argues that neither type of claim 
can be maintained). It should also be noted that Judge Dowd ""made several modifications"" to his September 25, 1990, Arnholt 
opinion and even held a second hearing on the same motion for summary judgment in November 1990. Columbia Gas Transm 
v. Natrl Gas Stor 80, et al, 5:88-cv-2935, ECF Doc. Nos. 58, 63. The Arnholt case settled before trial and, because more than 25 
years has passed since the issuance of these orders, the clerk of courts no longer maintains records of these documents. "
1356,," However, the docket history suggests that the issues in Judge Dowd's September 1990 order, on which Columbia relies, were 
not completely resolved. Further, this court, as well as other several federal courts, has subsequently distinguished Arnholt. See e.g., Columbia Gas 
Transmission, LLC. v. Crawford, 267 F.R.D. 227, 228 (N.D. Ohio 2010) (finding trespass claim was not preempted, at least for 
the time period prior to obtaining FERC certification.); Am. Energy Corp. v. Texas E. Transmission, LP, 701 F. Supp.2d 921, 932 
(S.D. Ohio 2010)(stating that ""neither the PSA [Pipeline Safety Act], nor the NGA, prevents claims based on state contract, tort, 
or property law.""); Van Scyoc v. Equitrans, L.P., 255 F. Supp. 3d 636, 2015 WL 1346872, at *7 (W.D. Pa. 2015) (concluding that 
landowner trespass and unjust enrichment claims were not completely preempted by the NGA); Humphries v. Williams Nat. Gas 
Co., 48 F. Supp. 2d 1276, 1279 (D. Kan. 1999) (finding the NGA did not preempt trespass and unlawful taking claims prior to the 
date the gas company filed its condemnation action); Abramson v. Florida Gas Transmission Co., 909 F. Supp. 410, 416 (E.D. 
La. 1995) (concluding that state contract, property law, and tort claims were not completely preempted by the NGA). In fact, in 
Crawford, this Court distinguished Arnholt by finding that claims for trespass occurring prior to FERC certification were 
permissible. Although Columbia asserts that the Medina Landowners do not allege occupation of their properties prior to the 
issuance of the FERC certificate (ECF Doc. No. 44 at Page ID# 726), that is not an accurate representation of the Complaint. 
The Complaint alleges that Columbia trespassed on the landowner's properties for an indeterminate period ""before or after 
obtaining a FERC certificate."" ECF Doc. No. 46, Page ID# 748 at ¶55. In consideration of all of the above, Arnholt is 
distinguishable and does not compel a different result."
1356,8," On the other hand, granting an injunction to cease operations could potentially conflict with §717f(b); however, this Court need 
not decide that issue as is more fully discussed in a later section of this order addressing the injunction claim. "
1358,9," An order granting in part Columbia's motion for partial summary judgment in Booth is being filed contemporaneously to this 
order. "
1365,1," See Defs.' Resp. to Am. Counter-Statement of Material Facts Not in Dispute ¶ 129 and response thereto, Oct. 30, 2014 
(originally filed in No. 3:07-cv-003040-DSC (W.D.). Pa. July 19, 2013)) (Plaintiff having stated, ""Somerset (Hospital] has a 
contract with Laurel Highlands Prison...."" and Defendants disputing this, replying, ""It is undisputed that Somerset Hospital has a 
non-exclusive contract with FHS, Physician and Healthcare Services, to provide Hospital care to inmates at Laurel Highlands 
prison.""). Notwithstanding the parties' disagreement over the particulars, they both agree that the contract was between 
Somerset Hospital and a third party, not Plaintiff and a third party, which is all that is necessary to support our determination that 
there has been no contractual relationship alleged to exist between Plaintiff and the prison (or the prison's proxy). No evidence 
has been presented to the contrary. We have also been directed to no unambiguous claim, let alone evidence, of existing 
contractual relations between Plaintiff and any prisoners. "
1367,2," ""Equitable remedy"" being defined as, a ""remedy, usu. a nonmonetary one such as an injunction or specific performance, 
obtained when available legal remedies, usu. monetary damages, cannot adequately redress the injury."" Black's Law Dictionary 
1485 (10th ed.). "
1369,3," In contrast to § 11111(a)(2), which, as discussed above, requires inquiry into the subjective mental state of the alleged wrong-
doer in order to ascertain whether the person knowingly provided false information to a professional review body. "
1374,4," Or Fact-Finding Task Force, as it is referred to in the Medical Executive Committee Meeting Minutes. "
1375,5," Plaintiff argued that Exhibit A is attached to his brief because ""the letter from Doctor Kates was withheld from the medical 
executive committee. So, if Doctor Kates' opinion wasn't relevant or able to overrule health regulations, maybe the question to 
ask is then why was it withheld."" Arg. Tr. 13. Plaintiff's question contains its answer: Dr. Kates' opinion was not relevant for the 
reasons discussed supra; so, rather than question why it was withheld, one could more reasonably ask why it should have been 
included. "
1376,6," Dr. Christopher Bonnet, a board-certified cardiologist and electrophysiologist specialist testified on Dr. Novak's behalf, and 
opined that Plaintiff's treatment did not fall below an acceptable standard of care. Defs.' Resp. to Am. Counter-Statement of 
Material Facts Not in Dispute ¶¶ 220-21, and responses thereto. "
1379,7," We additionally find that the Hospital's counsel, Daniel W. Rullo, Esq., having been appointed as Presiding Officer and as legal 
advisor to the Hearing Panel supports no inference of unreasonableness on the part of the Board, particularly because Attorney 
Rullo did not vote on the recommendations, and the Panel also made recommendations favoring Plaintiff rather than the 
Hospital (while still validating the Board's decision- making). In short, Plaintiff has again failed to show that there is evidence 
from which a reasonable jury could find that Plaintiff has rebutted by a preponderance the statutory presumption of the Hospital's 
compliance with the Act. "
1381,1," Section 152(2) states: ""The term 'employer' includes any person acting as an agent of an employer, directly or indirectly, but 
shall not include the United States or any wholly owned Government corporation, or any Federal Reserve Bank, or any State or 
political subdivision thereof, or any person subject to the Railway Labor Act, as amended from time to time, or any labor 
organization (other than when acting as an employer), or anyone acting in the capacity of officer or agent of such labor 
organization."" "
1382,2," The Court dismissed with prejudice all claims brought by Plaintiffs International Association of Bridge, Structural, Ornamental 
and Reinforcing Iron Workers, International Association Local 378, International Association Local 377, International Association 
Local 433, International Associations Local 29, and International Association of Bridge, Structural, Ornamental and Reinforcing 
Iron Workers Local 86 (collectively, the ""Union Plaintiffs""). (Dkt. No. 52.) Surf City Steel, Inc. and Sarens USA, Inc. are the only 
remaining Plaintiffs. "
1385,3," The Court agrees with Defendants that ""grandfather clause"" is not a term of art in relation to this exemption. (See 
Reconsideration Mot. at 5 n.3.) This does not mean, however, that the phrase is any less useful when discussing whether the 
PCLCD protects work previously performed by non-ILWU workers."
1385,4, The Court held in its Order that the PCLCD is not a valid work preservation agreement. (Order at 17.)
1385,5," The Court also clarifies that it appears that the ICTSI court and this Court are examining different levels in the process for the 
award of work. In ICTSI, the court found that the PCLCD only affected the parties to it, because non-PMA members could 
compete for work and, if awarded the work, could assign the work to non-ILWU workers. See ICTSI, 15 F. Supp. 3d at 1093-94 
(""Non-PMA members can compete for stevedoring work and its ancillary services and can assign anyone they choose to "
1386,," perform the reefer work.""). Based on Plaintiffs' SAC, this Court, however, views the issue as whether, once PMA members are 
awarded work, any non-ILWU member may compete for subcontracting work. The answer, under the PCLCD, appears to be 
""no."" Thus, the PCLCD eliminates competition for work unnaturally—and does not protect those who previously performed the 
work—once a PMA-member has been awarded the task. Even if the PCLCD contains a clause that ""goes some distance"" to 
ensure that narrow exceptions of work may be performed by non-ILWU workers (as counsel represented at oral argument), this 
does not change the Court's conclusion that the PCLCD does not primarily affect the parties to it, as the possibilities for 
competition to obtain new work and maintain previously-awarded subcontracting work are, by and large, unnaturally eliminated 
once a PMA-member company is awarded the work. "
1389,6," Moreover, though the Court need not reach the joinder requirements of Rule 19(a)(1)(B), the Court notes that Rule 19(a)(1)(B) 
also weighs in favor of PMA being a necessary party to this litigation. PMA claims that it has no interest in this litigation, 
precluding Rule 19(a)(1)(B)'s application. (See PMA Joinder Mot. at 9-10); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 19(a)(1)(B) (defining a 
required party as one who ""claims an interest relating to the subjection of the action""). But PMA undoubtedly has an interest in 
the PCLCD, and the outcome of this action could result in Defendants being subjected to inconsistent obligations under the 
PCLCD if PMA is not subject to any injunctive relief striking down the allegedly unlawful provisions. See Gray v. Oncor Elec. "
1390,," Delivery Co., LLC, No. 3:11-CV-00781-L, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 137854, 2011 WL 6039629, at *3 (N.D. Tex. Nov. 30, 2011) 
(""Although the Union has not come forward and claimed an interest in the subject of this action, it has an interest in the 
Agreement and the wages governed by that Agreement. As a result, Oncor could be subject to multiple or inconsistent 
obligations under the Agreement and subsequent litigation if the Union is not joined in this action.""). Thus, PMA likely qualifies as 
a required party under Rule 19(a)(1)(B) as well."
1390,7," Rule 19(b) addresses the appropriate way to proceed if joinder of a non-party is not ""feasible."" See Fed. R. Civ. P. 19(b). 
However, joinder is not feasible in three situations: (1) when venue would be improper; (2) when the non-party is not subject to 
personal jurisdiction; or, (3) when joinder would destroy the court's subject matter jurisdiction. See E.E.O.C. v. Peabody W. Coal 
Co., 400 F.3d 774, 779 (9th Cir. 2005). Neither Defendants, Plaintiffs, nor PMA argue that joinder is not feasible under Rule 19 
in this case; thus, the Court need not address feasibility. "
1397,*," Honorable Richard W. Goldberg, Judge for the United States Court of International Trade, sitting by designation. "
1400,1," Decisions of the Fifth Circuit, issued prior to the close of business on September 30, 1981 are binding precedent in this Circuit. 
Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1207 (11th Cir. 1981) (en banc). "
1401,2," Patheon argued in district court that the doctrine of ""unclean hands"" independently barred Procaps's lawsuit. Our prior opinions 
have not been clear as to whether this theory is viable in the antitrust arena. Thus, for example, relying on Perma Life Mufflers, 
Inc. v. Int'l Parts Corp., 392 U.S. 134, 88 S. Ct. 1981, 20 L. Ed. 2d 982 (1968), a panel of this Court observed in dicta that 
""because the Supreme Court has rejected the application of the doctrine of in pari delicto in antitrust actions, an agreement may 
be challenged even by one of the parties who has acquiesced in the unlawful agreement."" Tidmore Oil Co., 932 F.2d at 1388. 
But later, also in dicta, another panel clarified that ""Perma Life Mufflers explicitly left open the possibility that a defense of active 
involvement could bar a complaint about an antitrust conspiracy."" Official Comm. of Unsecured Creditors of PSA, Inc. v. 
Edwards, 437 F.3d 1145, 1156 (11th Cir. 2006). It would be odd indeed to allow Procaps to challenge the very agreement it had 
consummated on the grounds that it was an unlawful one, but because Procaps has not established that the Collaboration 
Agreement was an unlawful agreement in the first place, we need not resolve the matter today. "
1403,3," These same reasons confirm that the quick look doctrine would also be inapplicable. The quick look doctrine falls somewhere 
between the conclusive presumption of the per se rule and the more searching rule of reason analysis. It applies where ""an 
observer with even a rudimentary understanding of economics could conclude that the arrangements in question would have an 
anticompetitive effect on customers and markets."" See California Dental Ass'n v. FTC, 526 U.S. 756, 770, 119 S. Ct. 1604, 143 
L. Ed. 2d 935 (1999). The effects of the arrangements in this case are far from readily apparent. "
1408,1," Ocwen additionally argues that Plaintiffs fail to allege the substantive requirements of each § 1962 subsection. But the Court 
need not reach this analysis. See St. Paul Mercury Ins. Co. v. Williamson, 224 F.3d 425, 439 (5th Cir. 2000) (recognizing that 
the substantive requirements of each § 1962 subsection need only be addressed after the three RICO elements of person, 
racketeering pattern, and enterprise are met)."
1408,2," Ocwen does not address the issue, but it is not immediately apparent that Plaintiffs have sufficiently pleaded standing under 
RICO. See Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., Inc., 473 U.S. 479, 496, 105 S. Ct. 3275, 87 L. Ed. 2d 346 (1985); Price v. Pinnacle 
Brands, Inc., 138 F.3d 602, 606 (5th Cir. 1998). "
1409,3," Ocwen alleges in its motion that Plaintiffs incorrectly identified it as two separate entities, Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC and 
Ocwen Financial Corporation. Def.'s Mot. [11] at 1. "
1410,1," Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is the former corporate name of Indivior, Inc. (Amneal Compl. ¶ 21.) "
1411,2," Amneal develops, manufactures, and distributes generic pharmaceutical products. (Amneal Compl. ¶ 20.)"
1411,3," As noted below, Indivior has not moved to dismiss Amneal's product hop claim. As part of its product hop claim, Amneal 
alleges that as the period of exclusivity on brand-name Suboxone expired and generic versions of that drug were to become 
available, Indivior effectuated inconsequential changes to the Suboxone dosage form to prevent competition from generic 
formulations. "
1412,4," In reviewing Indivior's motion to dismiss, I assume that all facts found in Amneal's Complaint are true and view them in the light 
most favorable to Amneal, the non-moving party. To the extent any facts from outside the Complaint are recited, they are 
referenced for informational purposes only. See Ethypharm S.A. France v. Abbott Labs., 707 F.3d 223, 225 n.1 (3d Cir. 2013). "
1413,5," The FDA found that Indivior demonstrated ""that there is no reasonable expectation that the costs of developing and making 
available [Suboxone] will be recovered from U.S. sales, despite the fact that the product treats a disease or condition that has a 
U.S. prevalence of 200,000 or more individuals."" (Id. at ¶ 79.)"
1413,6," Like the Class Plaintiffs, Amneal also alleges that Indivior's switch from tablets to film was anticompetitive. Indivior, however, 
has not challenged the sufficiency of Amneal's product hop allegations. Indivior has also not challenged Amneal's allegations 
which pertain to the relevant market or monopoly power. As such, I have not set forth those aspects of Amneal's Complaint in 
this opinion. "
1417,7," ""[D]eception, reprehensible as it is, can be of no consequence so far as the Sherman Act is concerned."" Santana Prods. v. 
Bobrick Washroom Equip., Inc., 401 F.3d 123, 132 (3d Cir. 2005) (citing E. R. R. Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, 
Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 145, 81 S. Ct. 523, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464 (1961); Schachar v. Am. Acad. of Ophthalmology, Inc., 870 F.2d 397, 399 
(7th Cir. 1989) (""antitrust law does not compel your competitor to praise your product or sponsor your work"")). The Third Circuit 
recently reaffirmed this proposition and held that ""deceptive statements may violate the antitrust laws"" only in ""rare 
circumstances."" Eisai, Inc. v. Sanofi Aventis U.S., LLC, 821 F.3d 394, 407 n.40 (3d Cir. 2016). Nothing about the nature of the 
SSRS process or the Complaint's allegations warrant deviating from the general rule that deception is not actionable as an 
antitrust violation. "
1418,8," In support of this argument, Indivior emphasizes that the Complaint does not allege that, prior to February 22, 2013, Amneal 
had received ""tentative approval"" of its ANDA indicating that the FDA had determined that Amneal's generic product had met the 
requirements for bio-equivalency. Amneal objects to Indivior's suggestion that it must allege that it had obtained tentative 
approval from the FDA in order to state an actionable delay claim. Amneal correctly notes that tentative approval letters are only issued where the ANDA is premised on a brand name drug 
protected by a patent and/or other legal exclusivities. At the time Amneal filed its ANDA, Indivior's orphan drug exclusivity had "
1419,," already expired and, therefore, the FDA would not have issued a tentative approval letter for Amneal's ANDA. As such, Indivior's 
argument premised on the absence of allegations regarding tentative approval fails."
1419,9," Indivior attached these documents to its motion to dismiss and states that they ""are not here offered in support of this motion to 
dismiss, nor are they necessary for dismissal. They are cited only to demonstrate why the necessary allegations regarding 
Amneal's ANDA have not been made: Amneal knows that such allegations would be untrue."" (Def.'s Mot. p. 14.) I have not 
considered the substance of these documents when reviewing the sufficiency of Amneal's Complaint. "
1421,10," In its motion, Indivior also argued that Amneal's claim fails because it relies entirely on ""selective snippets of alleged marketing 
materials statements [sic] without any context."" (Def.'s Mot. p. 22.) Indivior urges that these isolated excerpts do not provide 
notice as to which statements are from which marketing materials at issue. Regardless of which phrases Amneal intends to 
challenge in the context of its Lanham Act claims, I agree. If Amneal chooses to amend its Lanham Act claim, it should endeavor 
to provide additional allegations regarding the context in which the challenged statements were made. "

1458,1," The lead case, assigned Civil Action No. 06-4305 in this District, was originally filed in 2003 in the United States District Court 
for the Northern District of Alabama, and the operative Second Amended Class Action Complaint (""SAC"") was filed on June 22, 
2004. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated the above captioned cases for pre-trial proceedings in the United 
States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania in 2006. The MDL was previously assigned to two other judges. 
(See Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation MDL 1782 Transfer Order dated August 24, 2006 (attached hereto as App'x A).) "
1459,2," Plaintiffs define ""independent pharmacies"" as having five or fewer locations. ""Chain pharmacies"" are defined as having six or 
more locations. (SAC ¶ 1.)"
1459,3," After this action was initially filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama, AdvancePCS was 
acquired by Caremark. See In re Pharmacy Benefit Managers Antitrust Litig., 582 F.3d 432, 434 n.1, 437 (3d Cir. 2009) (noting 
acquisition occurred in March 2004)."
1459,4," An Order entered on January 27, 2012 permitted Plaintiffs in Caremark to conduct additional class certification discovery and 
submit an amended Motion for class certification. (See ECF 171.) That Order also provided that, for the sake of efficiency and 
judicial economy, the class certification motions filed in the other MDL cases would be held under advisement while discovery 
proceeded in the lead case."
1459,5," Unless otherwise noted, all other ECF citations are to 06-MD-1782, the master MDL file for this litigation. "
1460,6," See also SAC ¶ 5d (""[Caremark acts] as a conduit for the Client Payors to engage in horizontal restraint of trade by removing 
the need and existence for any market whereby they must compete in order to secure the services of pharmacists to service 
their insured. The removal of this market and the conferring of the aggregate power to negotiate these services upon [Caremark] 
and other PBMs amounts to horizontal price fixing as it allows for the stabilization and repression of the fees pharmacists would 
be able to charge in a free and open market."") After the case was filed in Alabama, it was transferred to the Northern District of Illinois. (See No. 04-cv-05674 (N.D. Ill.) On 
August 12, 2005, that Court issued an order holding that the Plan Sponsor conspiracy claim was subject to rule of reason 
analysis. See North Jackson Pharmacy, Inc. v. Caremark Rx, Inc., 385 F. Supp. 2d 740 (N.D. Ill. 2005) (""the Illinois Opinion""). 
There has not yet been a judicial determination whether the inter-PBM conspiracy is to be adjudicated under the per se rule, the 
rule of reason or a quick-look analysis. For purposes of the pending motions only, it is assumed that the per se rule applies to 
that claim. Accordingly, the discussion infra related to product and geographic market definitions and market power refers only to 
the rule of reason claim. It should be noted that in the introduction to their certification submission, Plaintiffs assert that ""[b]oth conspiracies involve 
horizontal arrangements subject to per se analysis, not evaluation under the rule of reason."" (ECF 248 at 1 (emphasis added).) 
They go on to argue at length that the Illinois Opinion, issued before the case became part of the MDL, erroneously determined 
that the rule of reason applied to the Caremark-Plan Sponsor conspiracy claim (see ECF 248 at 16-22) and assert that ""the 
Court should reject any attempt by Caremark to justify its agreements to fix prices."" (Id. at 22.) The determination that the rule of 
reason and not the per se rule applied to the Plan Sponsor conspiracy claim is the law of the case, and Plaintiffs fail to couch 
their argument in terms that acknowledge that significance. This failure is somewhat odd considering that law of the case issues 
have previously arisen in the MDL with Plaintiffs successfully asserting before the United States Court of Appeals for the Third 
Circuit that the prior transferor judge erred in failing to grant law of case status to a ruling issued by a transferee judge. See In re 
Pharmacy Benefit Managers Antitrust Litig., 582 F.3d 432, 439 (3d Cir. 2009) (stating that the '""[l]aw of the case rules have 
developed ""to maintain consistency and avoid reconsideration of matters once decided during the course of a single continuing 
lawsuit.""'"" (quoting Casey v. Planned Parenthood of Se. Pa., 14 F.3d 848, 856 (3d Cir. 1994) (quoting 18 Charles A. Wright, 
Arthur R. Miller, Edward Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure § 4478 at 788 (2d ed.1981))). Under law of the case doctrine, the discretion of a court to revisit its own ruling or that of a coordinate court is limited to 
""extraordinary circumstances"" (1) where new evidence is available, (2) where a supervening new law has been announced, (3) 
where there is a need to clarify or correct an earlier, ambiguous ruling, or (4) where an unambiguous ruling might lead to an 
unjust result. In re Pharmacy Benefit Managers Antitrust Litig., 582 F.3d at 439 (internal quotations and citations omitted). 
Because Plaintiffs cite to no new evidence or change in the law, the Illinois Opinion's discussion of why the per se rule should 
not apply to the Plan Sponsor conspiracy claim is unambiguous, and the result that the rule of reason should apply thereto is not 
unjust, there is no cause to revisit the ruling. Moreover, to the extent that Plaintiffs argue that the ruling was incorrect, we fully 
agree with the Illinois Opinion's reasons for determining that the conspiracy alleged between Caremark and the Plan Sponsors 
should be governed under the rule of reason.  [*15] See Illinois Opinion, 385 F. Supp. 2d at 749 (because ""the bundle of 
services provided by Caremark reflects a cooperative arrangement between Caremark and the Plan Sponsors that has 
efficiency-enhancing potential"" rule of reason analysis was appropriate). "
1463,7," Dr. Cowan is Managing Partner of Analytic FocuSLLC, a company headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama that provides 
litigation support and expert witness services including the measurement and mitigation of risk for financial intermediaries. (ECF 
181-2, March 15, 2006 Expert Report of Charles D. Cowan (""2006 Cowan Report"") at 1.) He is an adjunct professor in the 
School of Business and the School of Public Health at the University of Alabama - Birmingham. Dr. Cowan's background covers 
40 years of research and study in the areas of statistics, economics, and their application to business problems. His firm 
conducts research for legal matters, including litigation support and expert witness services when requested. His work focuses 
on measurement of risk for financial intermediaries. His area of practice also includes support of Federal and State agencies 
needing economic and financial analysis to pursue their missions. Prior to founding Analytic Focus, he served as Chief 
Statistician for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Director for Price Waterhouse where he headed the Financial 
Services Group in the Quantitative Methods Division, and 12 years of service at the U.S. Bureau of the Census where he was 
responsible for the evaluation of the Decennial Census and held the title of Chief of the Survey Design Branch. He also 
previously served as a professor in the Business School at UAB, as a research professor at the University of Illinois, and in other 
academic and professional positions."
1463,8, His hypotheses are:
1463,1, ) dispensing fees paid to plaintiffs are significantly less than fees paid to larger pharmacies
1463,2, ) ingredient fees paid to plaintiffs are significantly less than fees paid to larger pharmacies
1463,3," ) net returns (dispensing fees + ingredient fees - charges and addons [sic]) are significantly less than fees paid to larger 
pharmacies"
1463,4," ) variability between prices paid to plaintiffs by PBMs for services is less than variability in prices paid to larger pharmacies 
in the insured market for services"
1463,5," ) levels and variability between prices paid to plaintiffs by PBMs for services is less than levels and variability in prices 
paid to larger pharmacies in an open market for services - a comparison between pricing by all pharmacies in sales to the 
uninsured versus pricing by all pharmacies in sales to the insured"
1463,6," ) contracts for independent pharmacists rejected by the PBMs are equal in value to contracts accepted by PBMs from 
larger pharmacies (PBMs acting against self-interest)"
1463,7," ) simultaneous choices by PBMs of Average Wholesale Prices (AWPs) to use from a set of AWP rates favor PBMs rather 
than their clients, the payors, and simultaneously [*24]  hurt independent pharmacies out of proportion to large pharmacies"
1463,8, ) RxHub can be used to share pricing information between PBMs through standard analytical techniques. (2006 Cowan Report at 2.) 
1464,9," Cowan does, however, opine that the following possibilities of analyses need to be considered: a) Analysis of covariance - permits the use of continuous and categorical explanatory variables b) Discriminant function analysis - a system of regressions with specific characteristics designed to cluster members of the 
population (e.g. independent pharmacists in the South vs. chains in the South vs. independent pharmacist in the West vs. 
chains in the West, etc.) c) Multivariate Analysis of Covariance - multiple simultaneous predictions using analysis of covariance (e.g. one for each 
drug in one large regression), d) SUR - Seemingly [*28]  unrelated regression - used to run separate regressions and then relate the error terms, an 
alternative to simultaneous equations e) Canonical correlations - multiple dependent variables on the right hand side of the equation with the same set of 
explanatory variables on the left t hand side "
1465,," f) Hierarchical linear models (known in econometrics as variable parameter regressions) - allows the parameters in the 
regression to vary as random variables that are a function of other common predictor variables. (2006 Cowan Report at 38.) "
1466,10," Dr. Seguin's model is expressed as the equation: Reimbursement = α + δINPCFF + β Quantity + ε, where NPCFF is the 
indicator variable for the Number of Pharmacies within a Chain is Five or Fewer. He states that, since the indicator variable 
NPCFF [*36]  takes on values of either zero or one, the above equation can be re-written as: (Id. at 4.)"
1466,11," Dr. Seguin opines that, Using ordinary-least squares estimation, the estimates of α, β and δ are $6.43, $2.73 and -$1.00. The t-statistic associated 
with the estimate of δ is -25.5. Common measures of suitability confirm that the model is appropriate as R2 = .761, so over "
1467,," three-quarters of the total variation in Reimbursement is explained by the two variables and the F-statistic, that measures 
that the joint-significance of the two variables exceeds 2.7 million. (Id. at 5.) "
1468,12," Dr. Hausman is the MacDonald Professor of Economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He graduated from 
Brown University in 1968 and received his doctorate in economics in 1973 from Oxford University. (ECF 261-10 at 1.) He 
received the John Bates Clark Award of the American Economic Association in 1985, which is awarded every other year for the 
most ""significant contributions to economics"" by an economist under the age of 40. He was awarded the Frisch Medal of the 
Econometric Society in 1980. He was named a Distinguished Fellow by the American Economic Association in 2013. He has 
published over 170 academic research papers in leading economic journals, including the American Economic Review, 
Econometrica, and the Rand (Bell) Journal of Economics; he has also been an associate editor of Econometrica, the leading 
economics journal, and the Rand (Bell) Journal of Economics, the leading journal of applied microeconomics. (Id. at 1-2.) "
1470,13," Both Dr. Cowan and Dr. Seguin have filed rebuttals to Dr. Hausman. Regarding Hausman's assertion that he has failed to 
define a relevant market, Dr. Cowan opines ""that it is clear from Dr. Hausman's own summary of the reach and scope of the 
PBMs that he believes that the market served by the PBMs in national."" (ECF 248, Ex. E (July 31, 2015 Rebuttal Expert Report 
of Charles D. Cowan, Ph.D. (""Cowan Rebuttal"") at 3.) He continues that Hausman's assertion that the geographic scope of retail 
pharmacy services is local is both misleading and incorrect. Cowan notes that the class claims are about the national reach and 
impact of PBMs, and that he has personally shopped at chain pharmacies ""in different states and paid exactly the same 
negotiated price for prescription medicines, regardless of where I am."" (Id.)"
1470,14," In his rebuttal to Dr. Hausman, Dr. Seguin concedes that, ""for demonstration purposes I examined only the reimbursement for 
brand-name (non-generic) prescription fulfillment. One goal of my Report was to demonstrate feasibility, which I did successfully 
for the one market I examined. Once class certification is granted, I can apply my methods to generics."" (ECF 248, Ex. D (July 
31, 2015 Expert Rebuttal Report by Paul J. Seguin, PhD (""Seguin Rebuttal"")) at 4.)"
1470,15," To address the criticism that he did not consider the size of the chain, Dr. Seguin responds that his ""NPC"" variable, which is 
the number of pharmacies in a chain, is used to isolate whether or not a chain contains five or fewer locations. He opines that 
this adequately considers size. To address the criticism that he did not consider pharmacy networks, Seguin has appended a new exhibit to his rebuttal in which 
he analyzed reimbursements for the 10 most commonly filled prescriptions as defined by Dr. Hausman, selecting the single most 
prescribed quantity, then, for each unique value of ""network ID,"" calculated the average total reimbursement and the percent of "
1471,," those prescriptions filled under that network ID by IP. (Seguin Rebuttal at 5.) He opines that ""[t]he (statistically significant) 
negative correlations show that as the percent of prescriptions under that network ID filled by independent pharmacies goes up, 
average compensation declines. In other words, those network IDs associated with greater independent pharmacy participation 
are also associated with lower rates of reimbursement."" (Id.) He finds a 15.3% decline in the average reimbursement for filling a 
prescription of 30 pills under an IP contract as compared to a chain contract. (Id. at 6.) Dr. Seguin's use of averages is 
addressed infra. To address the criticism that he did not consider market concentration, Seguin contends that his NPZ variable, which is the 
number of pharmacies in a zip code, is used to account for market concentration. While he did not specifically discuss his 
reasons for using zip codes in his first report, he asserts that using it to define geographic areas is accepted and is used by Dr. 
Hausman himself. (Id. at 7-8.) He also contends that using zip codes addresses Hausman's criticism concerning the lack of 
geographic factors. (Id. at 10.) He adds that he has also incorporated median income of each zip code, thereby accounting for 
demographic factors. (Id.) He concedes that he has not considered ""membership in a bargaining collective,"" but notes that this 
data was not provided by either side. (Id.) He explains the lack of consideration of the ""tradeoff between brand name and generic 
drugs"" by noting that ""the decision to fill 'as written' is generally up to the prescribing physician, an individual that is not a party to 
this case and not subject to any influence by the PBM."" (Id.)"
1471,16," Dr. Seguin responds that Dr. Hausman has misinterpreted his testimony that ""geography is not a factor,"" noting that he has 
estimated a model where geography is made a variable through first excluding and then including the NPZ term. (Seguin 
Rebuttal at 12-13.) He found that allowing for zip-code specific variation did not alter his conclusions concerning reimbursement 
discrimination; thus ""geography was not a factor, as significant discrimination was found using either method."" (Id. at 13.) Seguin 
suggests that Hausman's test is flawed because the sample size and the required parameters are limited to the small number of 
prescriptions filled within Jackson County. (Id. at 13-14.) He adds that, should the class be certified, he could alter and increase 
the breadth of his variables to account for local variations. (Id. at 14.) "
1472,17," Dr. Cowan takes issue with Dr. Hausman's assertion that Dr. Seguin has not demonstrated harm to competition. According to 
Cowan, Hausman is ""only looking at one piece of Dr. Seguin's analysis and not considering the whole of his analysis where Dr. 
Seguin demonstrates that the impact of the PBMs is to reduce the number of independent pharmacies including small chains 
relative to the total number of pharmacies nationally - clearly a harm to competition."" (Cowan Rebuttal at 6.) However, Dr. 
Cowan does not explain how the reduction in the IPs' market share constitutes harm to competition, rather than harm to certain 
competitors — an important distinction since the anti-trust laws have been enacted for the protection and preservation of 
competition, not for the protection of competitors. See Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 U.S. 477, 488, 97 S. Ct. 
690, 50 L. Ed. 2d 701 (1977) (citing Brown Shoe, 370 U.S. at 320). Regarding Hausman's discussion of monopsony power, 
Cowan responds that ""if the small Independent doesn't agree to a severely reduced reimbursement, the PBM simply doesn't 
agree to work with them, thus restricting the quantity of purchases."" (Id.) Regarding the concept of distinguishing monopsony 
power from bargaining power, Cowan opines that Hausman ""is assuming away the problem instead of considering that this is 
essentially a legal question about impacts and the loss of competition because of interference in the market."" (Id. at 7.) He takes 
issue with Hausman's ""very narrow definition"" asserting that, if by market output one can interpret the reduction in the number of 
small chains and the consolidation of the market into a few very large players because of the actions of the PBMs, then Dr. 
Hausman himself is arguing that there is a competitive harm. (Id.)"
1472,18," Dr. Seguin testified: ""Q. Was it important in any way for your work to understand the nature of the conspiracy alleged in the 
Complaint? A. Only to the extent of defining the class (i.e., as IPs with five or fewer locations). . . . Q. In your work on this case, 
did you make any assumptions about what a but-for world would look like? A. No."" (Seguin Dep. at 73-74.) "
1473,19," Dr. Seguin stated: ""Q. So that you're stating that for these two years combined the differential when you add it all up is roughly 
$23 million, correct? A. Correct. Q. And you're not saying of that $23 million how much may have been caused by a conspiracy 
and how much may have been caused by something else; is that correct? A. Correct."" (Seguin Dep. at 75.)"
1473,20," Dr. Seguin responds that Dr. Hausman's assertion — that the differential Seguin finds between chain and IP reimbursements 
may be due to lawful behavior including the relative bargaining power of small versus large pharmacies — is speculation. 
(Seguin Rebuttal at 20.) He reiterates that his model estimates the difference between the compensation to a chain pharmacy 
for filling a particular drug versus the compensation for the identical service performed by an IP. (Id.) "
1474,21," Dr. Seguin responds that Dr. Hausman ""does not argue with the $300,103 differential, he merely wonders how this differential 
should be allocated among class members."" (Seguin Rebuttal at 15.) He asserts that the F test examines whether Hausman's 
more complicated analysis ""offers a better fit than my parsimonious model which requires estimating only three parameters,"" and 
finds that allowing the variable ""to vary across pharmacy names offers a better fit."" (Id.) Seguin contends that this finding is 
specious because: (1) while Hausman argues that markets are local, his specification implies that all locations receive the same 
reimbursement regardless of their locale; (2) a substantial percent of the pharmacies Hausman selected filled a prescription for a 
selected drug only once during the year; thus sufficient data (which Seguin defines as at least 30 observations) exist for 
estimating pharmacy-specific reimbursement differentials for only 20%-36% of the pharmacies; (3) Hausman's F test does not 
directly compare his model to Seguin's because Hausman's model does not include information on whether the particular 
pharmacy is a chain or an IP; virtually all of the pharmacy to pharmacy dispersion Hausman documents is explained by whether 
that pharmacy was an IP or a chain; and (4) Hausman's specification provides no insight to the trier of facts concerning the key 
issue of whether IP's receive a lower reimbursement than do chains. (Id. at 16-20.)"
1474,22," Dr. Cowan responds to Dr. Hausman's criticism involving Dr. Seguin's use of averages that fails to show pharmacy level 
variation contending that Seguin's analysis ""doesn't preclude pharmacy level variation — he's measuring an average, as Dr. 
Hausman states. In the real world, one would expect there to be pharmacy level variation, but that doesn't mean that there is not 
an overall impact on the Independents. . . . [I]t is misleading to argue that there is significant variation in pharmacy by pharmacy 
reimbursement without considering that one major component of that variation is the average reduction observed for 
Independents."" (Cowan Rebuttal at 8.) "
1476,23," Cowan's response to Hausman's discussion of monopsony power is unavailing. Cowan asserts that ""if the small Independent 
doesn't agree to a severely reduced reimbursement, the PBM simply doesn't agree to work with them, thus restricting the 
quantity of purchases."" (Cowan Rebuttal at 6.) There appears to be no evidence in the record to support this assertion. 
Regarding the concept of distinguishing monopsony power from bargaining power, Cowan opines that Hausman ""is assuming 
away the problem instead of considering that this is essentially a legal question about impacts and the loss of competition 
because of interference in the market."" (Id. at 7.) However, it is Plaintiffs' class certification burden to show impact and loss of 
competition because of market interference through common evidence. The assertion that there has been a ""reduction in the 
number of small chains and the consolidation of the market into a few very large players,"" does not itself demonstrate illegal 
behavior since consolidation may be the result of market forces, a factor that the Plaintiffs fail to exclude as a possible reason for 
the impact they allege. "
1477,24," It must also be noted that although the SAC asserts that Caremark acted as a ""conduit for the Client Payors to engage in 
horizontal restraint of trade by removing the need and existence for any market whereby they must compete in order to secure 
the services of pharmacists to service their insured,"" (SAC ¶ 5d), Plaintiffs offered no expert economic analysis of this claim to 
support a rule of reason analysis. Their assertion that this activity gave Caremark and the other PBMs market power in the 
negotiation of these services to engage in horizontal price fixing (see ECF 181 at 4-5; SAC ¶ 5) is also unsupported by expert 
market analysis. "
1478,25," Even when pursuing a per se violation of the antitrust laws plaintiffs must establish that they suffered an antitrust impact. See 
Atl. Richfield Co. v. USA Petroleum Co., 495 U.S. 328, 341-42, 110 S. Ct. 1884, 109 L. Ed. 2d 333 (1990) (""We also reject 
respondent's suggestion that no antitrust injury need be shown where a per se violation is involved.""); In re Mercedes-Benz 
Antitrust Litig., 213 F.R.D. 180, 188 (D.N.J. 2003) (same). As the Court stated, The antitrust injury requirement ensures that a plaintiff can recover only if the loss stems from a competition-reducing 
aspect or effect of the defendant's behavior. The need for this showing is at least as great under the per se rule as under 
the rule of reason. Indeed, insofar as the per se rule permits the prohibition of efficient practices in the name of simplicity, 
the need for the antitrust injury requirement is underscored. ""[P]rocompetitive or efficiency-enhancing aspects of practices 
that nominally violate the antitrust laws may [*71]  cause serious harm to individuals, but this kind of harm is the essence of 
competition and should play no role in the definition of antitrust damages."" Page, The Scope of Liability for Antitrust 
Violations, 37 Stan.L.Rev. 1445, 1460 (1985). Thus, ""proof of a per se violation and of antitrust injury are distinct matters 
that must be shown independently."" P. Areeda & H. Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law ¶ 334.2c, p. 330 (1989 Supp.). Atl. Richfield Co., 495 U.S. at 344."
1478,26," Plaintiffs argue that the additional factors that Caremark raises ""simply represent an alternative view of the question and in no 
way show that Dr. Seguin's approach to local variation to be incapable of proving impact and damages on a class-wide basis."" 
(ECF 269 at 25.) They argue that the ""failure to include all the proper variables"" goes to an expert report's '""probativeness, not its 
admissibility."""" (Id. (quoting In re Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer (EPDM) Antitrust Litig., 256 F.R.D. 82, 98, 100-102 (D. 
Conn. 2009).) This pre-Blood Reagents authority is unhelpful. Courts must now ensure that expert evidence is admissible for 
Daubert purposes before a party may use it to meet their class certification burden. "
1479,27," In discussing the one dollar average differential Dr. Seguin used to calculate damages, and presented with a hypothetical 
situation where there are two pharmacies in the same town, one an IP and one a chain outlet, and the chain received a 
reimbursement that was 50 cents per Lipitor prescription filled higher than the IP — rather than the one dollar average he 
applied — Dr. Seguin testified that ""would necessarily mean some other independent pharmacy would get a dollar 50 per fill."" 
(ECF 261-8 at 55:2-4.) When asked how he would determine ""which pharmacy got the 50 cents and which got the dollar 50,"" Dr. 
Seguin testified ""I haven't thought that through. I — I've suggested on way or [sic] allocating aggregate damages."" (Id. at 55:7-9.) 
When asked if it was possible that in some areas IP are being paid the same reimbursement rates as chain outlets, he 
responded ""[f]rom a probability point of view, it's possible. . . . And yes, under that one plausible solution I provided [i.e., the one 
dollar differential]; even though they're getting the same as the pharmacy across the street, they would still get a dollar for every 
Lipitor prescription they filled under that scenario, which I'm simply suggesting."" (Id. at 55:11-56:7.) "
1480,," When confronted with Dr. Hausman's evidence that the data show that 52.60% of IPs receive reimbursements that are greater 
than the median chain (see Hausman Report at 25; Table 3), Dr. Seguin continued to assert that ""as a class, they suffered 
injuries of $300,000 for this drug."" (ECF 261-8 at 115.) When asked to assume an example of an IP that had one Lipitor 
prescription fill in 2005 for which it received a higher reimbursement rate than a chain pharmacy, and asked whether it had ""been 
harmed by the alleged conspiracy,"" Seguin stated that ""[a]s a member of the class, they were harmed. Again, you're asking me 
— if you're willing to concede there that the class was harmed by $300,000; I'm willing to have a different discussion as to how 
to apportion that. And, you know, whether or not a particular independent pharmacist who filled one prescription at $80 deserves 
compensation or not is, I think, up to the counsel and class to decide."" (Id. at 117:2-14.) "
1481,28," Where the class is proposed to be certified under Rule 23(b)(3), district courts typically analyze Rule 23(a)'s commonality 
requirement together with the more stringent predominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(3). Reyes, 802 F.3d at 486; see Sullivan 
v. DB Investments, Inc., 667 F.3d 273, 297 (3d Cir. 2011). The Third Circuit, however, recently cautioned that commonality must 
be established before predominance can be considered. Reyes, 802 F.3d at 486 (emphasis in original). "
1483,29," On the issue of whether named Plaintiffs received dispensing fees equal to or greater than chain outlets in their home 
markets, Dr. Cowan conceded in his deposition that ""[s]ome of the information that I saw from the first case told me that the 
dispensing fees that they received seemed to be in line with other chains that were in their market."" (ECF 261-12 at 482:4-7.) He 
maintained, however, that the data did not affect his analysis ""because I just got through describing an analysis that compared 
averages across a set of variables, and this is a specific independent pharmacy."" (Id. at 483:19-22 (emphasis added).) On the 
issue of whether named Plaintiff Big C suffered an antitrust injury, Dr. Cowan testified ""I simply haven't thought about how to 
look at individual pharmacies relative to the tests that I offered."" (Id. at 486:22-24.) He further testified: ""Q. Well, one of the things 
you propose in your report, is it not, that, in computing damages, for example, you would compare the predicted dispensing fee 
versus the actual dispensing fee. Right? A. Yes. Q. Now, if you applied that method to Big C — A. Um-hmm. Q. — you 
would get a 0 measure of damages. Right? A. Yes."" (Id. at 487:2-13 (emphasis added).) "
1484,30, There is no suggestion that counsel does not possess the experience or skill necessary to adequately represent the class. 
1487,31," The Third Circuit has held, however, that it is ""a misreading of Comcast"" to interpret it as ""preclud[ing] certification under Rule 
23(b)(3) in any case where the class members' damages are not susceptible to a formula for classwide measurement."" Neale v. 
Volvo Cars of N. Am., LLC, 794 F.3d 353, 375 (3d Cir. 2015) (quoting Comcast, 133 S.Ct. at 1437 (Ginsburg, J. & Breyer, J., 
dissenting) (citing 2 William B. Rubenstein, Newberg on Class Actions § 4:54 (5th ed.2012))) (collecting cases). "
1489,32," It must be noted that even after being presented with Dr. Hausman's criticism of his use of averages, Dr. Seguin prepared 
additional charts that still used averages. (See Seguin Rebuttal at 5-6.) Dr. Seguin's rebuttal to Dr. Hausman's criticism of his 
use of averages is unmoving. Seguin asserts that the problem is merely one of how the average differential ""should be allocated 
among class members."" (Id. at 15.) That is not the problem; the use of averages evidence is flawed because it does not 
constitute class-wide evidence of antitrust impact. It shows only that some members were allegedly impacted but does not show 
that they all were. "
1490,33," The order provides that the class period ""commences four years before the filing of this Complaint through the present,"" and 
the class definition excludes ""any pharmacies owned or operated by any of the Defendants, their subsidiaries, agents, or

1518,1," GIS argues that, ""[e]ven if [GIS] were required to allocate purchases on a per-territory basis, . . . [Defendants] ha[ve] waived 
any right . . . to require such allocation"" by failing to require such during the over two-decade duration of the Florida, Alabama, 
and Tennessee Agreements. (Doc. 123 at 19-21.) ""Waiver is the intentional relinquishment of a known right after full knowledge 
of the facts and depends upon the intention of one party alone."" Oakland Raiders v. Oakland-Alameda Cty. Coliseum, Inc., 144 
Cal. App. 4th 1175, 1189, 51 Cal. Rptr. 3d 144 (2006) (citation omitted). ""Waiver does not require any act or conduct by the 
other party"" and ""the pivotal issue in a claim of waiver is the intention of the party who allegedly relinquished the known legal 
right."" Id. at 1189-90 (citation omitted). As to implied waiver, ""where a plaintiff has knowledge of the defendant's breach and 
continues to perform under the contract and/or accepts the defendant's performance without notifying the defendant of the 
breach, a waiver is fairly implied."" Roling v. E*Trade Sec. LLC, 860 F. Supp. 2d 1035, 1039 (N.D. Cal. 2012) (citing A.B.C. 
Distrib. Co. v. Distillers Distrib. Corp., 154 Cal. App. 2d 175, 187, 316 P.2d 71 (1957)). In the present case, GIS has failed to point to any evidence in the record demonstrating that Guardian intentionally relinquished 
its contractual rights to have a purchase quota for each geographic area covered by the Florida, Alabama, and Tennessee 
Agreements. (See Doc. 123 at 19-21.) See generally Carmen v. S.F. Unified Sch. Dist., 237 F.3d 1026, 1031 (9th Cir. 2001) 
(""The district court need not examine the entire file for evidence establishing a genuine issue of fact, where the evidence is not 
set forth in the . . . papers with adequate references so that it could conveniently be found.""). Indeed, GIS has not even directed 
the Court to evidence that Guardian was aware before June of 2013 that GIS was not making purchases for each specific 
geographic area. (See id.) To the contrary, as GIS itself asserts, ""[i]t is undisputed that the parties never bothered to exchange 
records showing when or how much product was purchased for (or sold by) [GIS] in any given territory."" (Id. at 15.) Absent 
evidence of an intentional or knowing waiver, the Court finds that Guardian has not intentionally or impliedly waived its right to a 
per-territory purchase quota. GIS also argues that Guardian is ""estopped from making . . . a claim"" pursuant to ""its right to claim any breach of contract for 
failure to allocate"" the purchase quotas on a per-territory basis under the doctrine of equitable estoppel. (See Doc. 123 at 20-21.) 
""The doctrine of equitable estoppel is founded on concepts of equity and fair dealing"" and ""provides that a person may not deny 
the existence of a state of facts if he intentionally led another to believe a particular circumstance to be true and to rely upon 
such belief to his detriment."" Oakland Raiders, 144 Cal. App. 4th at 1189 (citation omitted). ""The traditional elements of 
estoppel"" include the following: (1) ""the party to be estopped must be apprised of the facts;"" (2) ""he must intend that his conduct 
shall be acted upon, or must so act that the party asserting the estoppel had a right to believe it was so intended;"" (3) the other 
party must be ignorant of the true state of fact;"" and (4) ""he must rely upon the conduct to his injury."" Id. (citation omitted). The Court is not persuaded by GIS's equitable estoppel argument. As with its waiver argument, GIS fails to point to any 
evidence indicating that Guardian was ""apprised"" of the pertinent facts—namely, that GIS was not satisfying the contractual "
1519,," purchase quotas on a per-territory basis—when it did not provide a notice of a breach before June of 2013. (See Doc. 123 at 20-
21.) Absent such evidence, GIS's equitable estoppel argument similarly fails."
1519,2," The Court notes that these notices of breach also reference ""sales quota[s]."" (Liddiard Decl., Exs. P-R.) However, the actual 
description of the breach references only deficient levels of ""purchases."" (See id.)"
1519,3," Guardian asserts that GIS admitted to not meeting the quotas in June and July of 2013 in an e-mail exchange on August 22, 
2013. (See Doc. 103 at 17 (citing Doc. 103, Ex. 3, Decl. of Calvin Davis in Opp. to GIS's Motion (""Second Davis Decl."") at 30-
31).) As GIS correctly notes, this e-mail exchange addresses ""inventory sales"" and not the relevant purchase quotas. (See 
Second Davis Decl. at 30-31 (emphasis added).) The Court therefore finds that this communication is not relevant in determining 
whether GIS satisfied its purchase quotas."
1519,4," On December 7, 2016, Guardian filed Evidentiary Objections in Opposition to GIS's Motion (the ""First Objection""). (Doc. 103, 
Ex. 6.) In the First Objection, Guardian objects to evidence that is irrelevant—and therefore moot—to the instant opinion, with 
two pertinent exceptions. First, Guardian objects to GIS's use of its interrogatory responses at the summary judgment stage. As 
the Ninth Circuit has noted, courts ""refuse[] to find a genuine issue where the only evidence presented is uncorroborated and 
self-serving testimony."" Carter v. Clark Cty., 459 F. App'x 635, at *1 (9th Cir. 2011) (citation omitted). While GIS's interrogatories, 
by themselves, may be insufficient to defeat summary judgment, Guardian has failed to direct the Court to evidentiary support on 
the issue of breach of the Florida, Alabama, and Tennessee Agreements. Further, even if GIS breached, summary judgment is 
not warranted because there remain genuine issues of material fact as to whether GIS's purported nonperformance was 
excused. Accordingly, Guardian's objection relating to GIS's interrogatory response is properly overruled. Second, Guardian objects—without any analysis or citation to authority—to certain portions of Christopher Nolan's deposition 
relating to the damages GIS has suffered since receiving the termination letters on the basis that this testimony is speculative 
and conclusory, improper opinion testimony, lack of foundation, and lack of personal knowledge. (See Doc. 103, Ex. 6 at 6.) The 
Court is again not persuaded by Guardian's objection. Christopher Nolan is the Executive Vice President of GIS. (Doc. 98, Ex. 1 
¶ 1.) As such, he has unique and relevant personal knowledge regarding any harm GIS may have suffered. Absent any specific 
further objection to this testimony, the Court finds that Guardian's objection regarding Mr. Nolan's testimony is properly 
overruled. For these reasons, the Court OVERRULES Guardian's First Objection. (Doc. 103, Ex. 6.) "
1520,5," GIS also argues that Defendants ""received exactly what [they] bargained for in the Agreements: a guaranteed minimum 
amount of product purchases by [GIS] each year."" (Doc. 123 at 18.) GIS asserts that, as such, ""any failure by [GIS] to formally 
allocate purchases on a per-territory basis"" is not a ""material breach"" of the Florida, Alabama, and Tennessee Agreements that 
""could . . . have formed a basis to terminate"" these agreements. (Id. at 12-13.) In the context of breaches of contractual requirements, California law ""recognizes that although every instance of noncompliance 
with a contract's terms constitutes a breach, not every breach justifies treating the contract as terminated."" Boston LLC v. 
Juarez, 245 Cal. App. 4th 75, 82, 199 Cal. Rptr. 3d 452 (2016) (citation omitted). ""Following the lead of the Restatements of 
Contracts, California courts allow termination only if the breach can be classified as 'material,' 'substantial,' or 'total.'"" Id. (citation 
omitted). ""[A] term may be 'material' in one of two ways: [i]t may be a necessary term, without which there can be no contract; or, 
it may be an important term that affects the value of the bargain."" Vasile v. Flagship Fin. Grp., LLC, No. 2:12-CV-02912-KJM-
CKD, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 81266, 2014 WL 2700896, at *4 (E.D. Cal. June 13, 2014) (first alteration in original) (quoting 
Facebook, Inc. v. Pac. Northwest Software, Inc., 640 F.3d 1034, 1037 (9th Cir. 2011)). If GIS failed to perform (or subsequently cure that nonperformance) as required by the Florida, Alabama, and Tennessee 
Agreements in June and July of 2013, there remains the question as to whether that failure was a material deviation from the 
terms of these agreements that would justify Guardian's termination of the agreements. In particular, while Guardian may have 
gained the benefit of GIS purchasing sufficient products to satisfy the aggregate quotas of these agreements, Guardian would 
have lost the benefit of GIS purchasing products specifically for the geographic area covered by each agreement. Nonetheless, California law ""accepts that '[w]hether a breach is so material as to constitute cause for the injured party to 
terminate a contract is ordinarily a question for the trier of fact.'"" Del Mar Seafoods, Inc. v. Cohen, No. C 07-02952 WHA, 2008 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 30057, 2008 WL 1734749, at *8 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 11 2008) (quoting Superior Motels, Inc. v. Rinn Motor Hotels, 
Inc., 195 Cal. App. 3d 1032, 1051-52, 241 Cal. Rptr. 487 (1987)). The Court therefore finds that the materiality of GIS's 
purported nonperformance under the Florida, Alabama, and Tennessee Agreements is properly reserved for the jury. See, e.g., 
id. (noting that materiality is a ""question . . . of degree, to be answered, if there is doubt, by the triers of the facts"" (quoting 
Superior Motels, Inc., 195 Cal. App. 3d at 1051)). "
1521,6," In its opposition to Defendants' Motion, GIS first argues that the Court should deny Defendants' Motion as to GIS's breach of 
contract claim because, even if GIS did not suffer ""pecuniary loss,"" it nonetheless may recover nominal damages. (Doc. 106 at 
12-13.) GIS is correct that ""a showing of actual damages is not required to establish a breach of contract"" under California law, 
""as a party may obtain nominal damages for a breach."" PNY Techs., Inc. v. Miller, Kaplan, Arase & Co., Case No. 15-cv-01728- "
1522,," MMC, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 133837, 2016 WL 5462456, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 28, 2016) (citations omitted); see, e.g., Tribeca 
Cos. v. First Am. Title Ins. Co., 239 Cal. App. 4th 1088, 1103 n.12, 192 Cal. Rptr. 3d 354 (2015) (""Generally, a plaintiff who 
proves a breach of duty (including breach of contract) but fails to show any appreciable detriment—i.e., damages—nevertheless 
may . . . recover nominal damages and, when appropriate, costs of suit."" (emphasis added) (citations omitted)); Sweet v. 
Johnson, 169 Cal. App. 2d 630, 632, 337 P.2d 499 (1959) (""A plaintiff is entitled to recover nominal damages for the breach of a 
contract, despite inability to show that actual damage was inflicted upon him, since the defendant's failure to perform a 
contractual duty is, in itself, a legal wrong that is fully distinct from the actual damages.""). However, the Ninth Circuit has found that, HN9[
] under California law, nominal damages are insufficient to survive summary 
judgment. Ruiz v. Gap, Inc., 380 F. App'x 689, 691-92 (9th Cir. 2010). Instead, to survive summary judgment, ""a breach of 
contract claim requires a showing of appreciable and actual damage."" Id. (quoting Aguilera v. Pirelli Armstrong Tire Corp., 223 
F.3d 1010, 1015 (9th Cir. 2010)). The Court is therefore not persuaded by GIS's argument that its First Cause of Action can 
survive based only on a showing of nominal damages."
1522,7," On December 15, 2016, Guardian filed an Objection to GIS's Evidence Filed Belatedly in Support of its Motion for Summary 
Judgment (the ""Second Objection""), in which Guardian objects to the additional evidence GIS filed in support of GIS's Motion. 
(Doc. 116.) The Court notes that, to the extent any of this additional evidence is relevant to the analysis in the instant opinion, 
GIS provided it to the Court in conjunction with its initial motion and/or oppositions. GIS thus did not file the pertinent evidence 
solely in conjunction with a reply and, consequently, Guardian's Second Objection is properly overruled. Cf. Provenz v. Miller, 
102 F.3d 1478, 1483 (9th Cir. 1996) (""[W]here new evidence is presented in a reply to a motion for summary judgment, the 
district court should not consider the new evidence without giving the [non-]movant an opportunity to respond."" (quoting Black v. 
TIC Inv. Corp., 900 F.2d 112, 116 (7th Cir. 1990))). Accordingly, the Court OVERRULES the Second Objection. (Doc. 116.)"
1522,8," The Court notes that Defendants do not move for summary judgment as to any particular type of damage. (See, e.g., Doc. 93, 
Ex. 1.) Instead, the only issue regarding the damages element presently before the Court is whether GIS has shown any form of 
viable damages that may sustain its claim in its First Cause of Action. "
1523,9," Defendants offer two additional arguments regarding the damages element of GIS's First Cause of Action that require a brief 
discussion. First, Defendants argue that summary judgment is appropriate because GIS failed to ""fulfill[] its duty to mitigate its 
purported damage."" (Doc. 93, Ex. 1 at 8.) The Court disagrees. As correctly noted by GIS, ""[w]hether a plaintiff acted reasonably 
to mitigate damages . . . is a factual matter to be determined by the trier of fact."" Agam v. Gavra, 236 Cal. App. 4th 91, 111, 186 
Cal. Rptr. 3d 295 (2015) (quoting Powerhouse Motorsports Grp., Inc. v. Yamaha Motor Corp. U.S.A., 221 Cal. App. 4th 867, 
884, 164 Cal. Rptr. 3d 811 (2013)). As such, the question of whether GIS mitigated its damages is not properly before the Court 
at the instant summary judgment stage. See, e.g., Hitek Software LLC v. Timios, Inc., No. CV 12-709 CAS (AJWx), 2012 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 86560, 2012 WL 2366368, at *6 (C.D. Cal. June 18, 2012) (""[T]he resolution of th[e] question [of mitigation] goes to 
the amount of damages, if any, that plaintiff may recover rather than to defendants' liability.""). Second, Defendants argue that summary judgment is appropriate as to the First Cause of Action because GIS ""seeks lost profit 
damages which are not recoverable"" because GIS ""has chosen to continue its performance under the [Agreements] after 
Defendants' purported repudiation of those contracts."" (Doc. 93, Ex. 1 at 8.) This argument mischaracterizes GIS's First Cause 
of Action. In this claim, GIS alleges that Guardian breached the Florida, Alabama, and Tennessee Agreements by ""purporting to 
terminate or actually terminating the agreements without cause."" (Doc. 67 ¶ 55.) At no point in this claim does GIS allege any 
form of anticipatory repudiation that may implicate this doctrine. (See id. ¶¶ 53-57.) Compare Boland, Inc. v. Rolf C. Hagen 
(USA) Corp., 685 F. Supp. 2d 1094, 1101 (E.D. Cal. 2010) (""Under California law, a claim for breach of contract includes four 
elements: that a contract exists between the parties, that the plaintiff performed his contractual duties or was excused from 
nonperformance, that the defendant breached those contractual duties, and that plaintiff's damages were a result of the breach."" 
(citations omitted)), with Shahani v. United Commercial Bank, 457 B.R. 775, 783 (N.D. Cal. 2011) (""A party asserting express 
anticipatory repudiation must demonstrate that (1) the other party absolutely and unequivocally refused to perform and (2) it (the 
party asserting anticipatory repudiation) effectuated the other party's breach by materially changing its position and treating the 
repudiation as final."" (citations omitted)). The Court therefore declines Defendants' invitation to recast GIS's First Cause of 
Action as a claim for anticipatory repudiation. "
1526,10," The Court notes that, in his January 13, 2011 e-mail, GIS's representative, Mr. Schall referenced ""5% of the earnings for all 
sales processed by Bob's Discount Furniture that occur in any states that fall under the licensed distribution area in our Guardian 
contract."" (Liddiard Decl, Ex. V at 2.) However, the parties' December 22, 2010 oral agreement, as well as their subsequent 
conduct, clearly demonstrate that the parties' mutually consented to Guardian paying GIS five percent of all sales—not earnings 
from sales—to Bob's Discount Furniture that occur in the areas covered by the Agreements. Indeed, while the parties now 
disagree on whether there was mutual consent, they do agree that the arrangement reached by the parties involved Guardian 
paying five percent of its sales to Bob's Discount Furniture that occur in the covered areas. (See, e.g., Doc. 103 at 25; Doc. 123 
at 24 n.4.) The Court therefore finds that, despite Mr. Schall's reference to earnings in his January 13, 2011 e-mail, the parties 
mutually consented to Guardian paying to GIS five percent of Guardian's relevant sales to Bob's Discount Furniture. "
1527,11," The Mid-Atlantic, Ohio, Cook County, Indiana, Midwest, Florida, Alabama, and Tennessee Agreements all also define the term 
""Guardian Labeled Distributor Product"" as ""[p]roducts that are produced or caused to be produced by [Guardian] which are 
identified as Guardian Products on the front panel of the product label."" The Court notes that there may be a conflict between 
this general definition and the specific list of products provided in the exhibits to these agreements. In other words, certain 
products may constitute ""Guardian Labeled Distributor Products"" under the general definition even if they are omitted from the 
lists in the exhibits. However, to the extent there is any conflict, the Court finds that the specific and explicitly exclusive list of 
products governs. See, e.g., [*55]  Boghos v. Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's of London, 36 Cal. 4th 495, 504, 30 Cal. Rptr. 3d 
787, 115 P.3d 68 (2005) (noting that, where ""provisions . . . are truly inconsistent,"" the ""more specific contractual provisions 
control over more general ones"" (citations omitted))."
1527,12," By its order entered on January 5, 2017, the Court directed the parties to file the following: (1) ""the exhibits . . . listing the 
'Guardian Labeled Distributor Products' for each of the [Agreements] . . . ;"" and (2) ""any 'mutually agreed upon Addendum[s],' as 
referenced in the [A]greements' paragraph pertaining to the 'Guardian Labeled Distributor Products' included in these 
[A]greements."" (Doc. 119.) In response to this order, GIS filed an April 30, 2015 e-mail which GIS argues ""replaced the product 
list exhibits to the [Agreements]."" (Doc. 121.) As noted above, with the exception of the Pennsylvania Agreement, the Agreements each provide that ""[i]t is understood that 
unless specifically noted by a mutually agreed upon Addendum hereto, Guardian Labeled Distributor Products shall be only 
those items indicated on [a specific exhibit] which is attached hereto. (Doc. 120, Ex. 2 ¶ 7(c); id., Ex. 3 ¶ 8; id., Ex. 4 ¶ 7(c); id., 
Ex. 5 ¶ 8; id., Ex. 6 ¶ 8; id., Ex. 7 ¶ 8; id., Ex. 8 ¶ 7(c); id., Ex. 9 ¶ 8.) The exhibit GIS filed relating to an April 30, 2015 e-mail 
exchange is not an exhibit or addendum attached to the Agreements. (See Doc. 121, Ex. 1.) To the contrary, the e-mail 
addresses a ""price list"" and does not otherwise provide any indication that it is a relevant ""Addendum hereto,"" as required by the 
Agreements. (See id.) Accordingly, the Court finds that the April 30, 2015 e-mail and its associated materials are not relevant to 
the determination as to what products qualify as ""Guardian Labeled Distributor Products."" "
1528,13," The Court notes that the Pennsylvania Agreement includes two exhibits that list products. (See Doc. 120, Ex. 1 at 10-21.) 
However, unlike the remaining agreements, the Pennsylvania Agreement does not include language indicating that these 
exhibits list the products that constitute ""Guardian Labeled Distributor Products."" (See Doc. 120, Ex. 1.) "
1530,14," GIS argues that the Bob's Discount Furniture Agreement included an express term of duration based on the conduct of the 
parties. (See Doc. 123 at 18-19.) The Court disagrees. The record regarding the oral and written understanding of the parties, 
while referencing the respective obligations of the parties, does not provide any type of express agreement regarding duration. 
(See, e.g., Liddiard Decl., Ex. V.) "
1535,15," The California choice-of-law provisions in the Agreements do not overcome the presumption against extraterritorial application 
of California law. See O'Connor v. Uber Techs., Inc., 58 F. Supp. 3d 989, 1005 (N.D. Cal. 2014) (""A contractual choice of law 
provision that incorporates California law presumably incorporates all of California law — including California's presumption 
against extraterritorial application of its law.""); Cotter v. Lyft, Inc., 60 F. Supp. 3d 1059, 1065 (N.D. Cal. 2014) (""Even if the 
choice of law provision were intended to confer upon out-of-state drivers a cause of action for violation of California's wage and 
hour laws, it could not do so. An employee cannot create by contract a cause of action that California law does not provide."")."
1535,16," The FTC Franchise Rule is a Federal Trade Commission regulation promulgated pursuant to the FTCA. See Nieman v. 
DryClean U.S.A. Franchise Co., 178 F.3d 1126, 1129 (11th Cir. 1999)."
1535,17," The definitions of ""franchise"" and ""franchisee"" set forth in the state franchise laws upon which GIS also predicates its Section 
17200 claim are similar to that found in the Franchise Rule. (See, e.g., Cal. Corp. Code §§ 31005(a) (""franchise""), 31006 
(""franchisee""); Md. Code Ann., Bus. Reg. §§ 14-201(e)(1) (""franchise""), (g) (""franchisee""); N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law §§ 681(3) 
(""franchise""), (4) (""franchisee""); Ind. Code Ann. §§ 23-2-2.5-1(a) (""franchise""), (b) (""franchisee""); Iowa Code Ann. §§ 523H.1(3) 
(""franchise""), (5) (""franchisee""); 815 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 705/3(1) (""franchise""), (2) (""franchisee"").). "
1536,18," California state courts have similarly held that statutes with no private right of action can serve as the basis for a Section 
17200 claim. See Troyk v. Farmers Grp., Inc., 171 Cal. App. 4th 1305, 1335, 90 Cal. Rptr. 3d 589 (2009); McKell v. Wash. Mut., 
Inc., 142 Cal. App. 4th 1457, 1475, 49 Cal. Rptr. 3d 227 (2006); Kasky v. Nike, Inc., 27 Cal. 4th 939, 950, 119 Cal. Rptr. 2d 296, 
45 P.3d 243 (2002); Stop Youth Addiction, Inc. v. Lucky Stores, Inc., 17 Cal. 4th 553, 566-67, 71 Cal. Rptr. 2d 731, 950 P.2d 
1086 (1998), superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in Californians For Disability Rights v. Mervyn's, LLC, 39 Cal. 4th 
223, 46 Cal. Rptr. 3d 57, 138 P.3d 207 (2006). "
1537,19," The only other case Defendants cite in support of this proposition, Sperling v. DSW Inc., No. EDCV151366JGBSPX, 2016 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11012, 2016 WL 354319, at *2 (C.D. Cal. Jan. 28, 2016), cites O'Donnell in dicta."
1537,20," GIS alleges that Defendants engaged in unfair competition under Section 17200 by failing to meet disclosure, registration, and 
filing requirements under various state franchise laws, including Maryland, New York, Indiana, Iowa, and Illinois (in addition to 
California). (See Doc. 67 ¶¶ 33-35, 40, 94-106.) Although neither party addresses the issue in their briefing, at least one court in 
this district has held that foreign state law may serve as the basis for a Section 17200 claim. See Process Specialties, Inc. v. 
Sematech, Inc., No. CIV. S-00-414FCD PAN, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26261, 2001 WL 36105562, at *15 (E.D. Cal. Nov. 8, 2001) 
(holding that the plaintiff may bring its Section 17200 claim based on a violation of Delaware law). But see Hilton v. Apple Inc., 
No. CV137674GAFAJWX, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 184769, 2014 WL 10435005, at *4 (C.D. Cal. Apr. 18, 2014) (dismissing 
Section 17200 claim based on the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act because ""[i]f the [c]ourt were to allow 
incorporation of [this act] into California law . . . . [Section 17200] would, for lack of a more polite phrase, swallow lesser laws 
whole""). "
1538,21," The California Supreme Court has defined ""unfair"" conduct under Section 17200 as ""conduct that threatens an incipient 
violation of an antitrust law, or violates the policy or spirit of one of those laws because its effects are comparable to or the 
same as a violation of the law, or otherwise significantly threatens or harms competition."" Cel-Tech Commc'ns, Inc. v. L.A. 
Cellular Tel. Co., 20 Cal. 4th 163, 187, 83 Cal. Rptr. 2d 548, 973 P.2d 527 (1999). A business practice is ""fraudulent"" within the 
meaning of Section 17200 if ""members of the public are likely to be deceived."" Kasky v. Nike, Inc., 27 Cal. 4th 939, 951, 119 Cal. 
Rptr. 2d 296, 45 P.3d 243 (2002). Again, Defendants do not address either the ""unfair"" prong or the ""fraudulent"" prong in their 
briefing regarding Defendants' Motion."
1538,22," GIS also argues that judicial estoppel bars Defendants' challenge to GIS's CFIL claim. For the reasons set forth above, see 
Section III.A.5.a, supra, GIS's judicial estoppel argument fails."
1538,23," Part 2 of the CFIL is titled ""Regulation of the Sale of Franchises."" See Cal. Corp. Code §§ 31101-31157. "
1539,24," Elsewhere in their briefing, GIS asserts that it has alleged a claim under Section 31301 of the CFIL. (See Doc. 106 at 26 
(""Here, GIS's claims, as set forth in the [SAC], arise under Cal. Corp. Code §§ 31202 and 31300-31301 . . . ."" (emphasis 
added)).) While GIS does make reference to Section 31301 in its SAC, a claim under Section 31301 is predicated on a violation 
of Section 31201, see Cal. Corp. Code § 31301, of which GIS makes no mention in the SAC, (see Doc. 67). Thus, the Court 
need not address the effect of the two-year limitations period that applies to such a claim. See Cal. Corp.Code § 31304. "
1540,25," GIS's assertion that the Agreements' automatic annual renewal would ""reset the statute of limitations clock""—for which it cites 
no legal authority—is undermined by case law. See, e.g., Salvesen v. La-Z-Boy, Inc., No. EDCV1402105VAPDTBX, 2014 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 192573, 2014 WL 12465444, at *4 (C.D. Cal. Nov. 21, 2014) (denying application for preliminary injunction where 
the plaintiff claimed that the amendment of an agreement ""triggered a new statute of limitations"" as to its CFIL claim, observing 
""[t]he plain language of the sections 31300 and 31303 dictates that to the extent [the plaintiff's CFIL] claim is predicated on 
[a]greements entered into outside the limitations period, it is likely to be time-barred""); Celsi v. H & R Block Tax Servs. LLC, 
A132634, 2012 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 5275, 2012 WL 2914293, at *5 (Cal. Ct. App. July 17 2012) (affirming the district court's 
decision sustaining a demurrer and dismissing CFIL claims where the plaintiff argued that conduct subsequent to the acquisition 
of the franchise rendered prior statements false and actionable under the CFIL.). "
1542,26," Indeed, the Court finds below that the EFPPs are not ""Guardian Labeled Distributor Products"" under the Mid-Atlantic 
Agreement. See section III.B.3, infra."
1542,27," Because the Court has found a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the EFPPs fall within the scope of the Mid-Atlantic 
Agreement, it need not reach the additional question of whether Renaissance was a ""national account,"" which would purportedly 
permit Guardian to sell products to Renaissance in Philadelphia without breaching the Mid-Atlantic Agreement. "
1543,28," In its First Counterclaim, Guardian requests declaratory relief, but fails to address the authority for the Court to provide such 
relief. (See Doc. 36 ¶¶ 26-30; see also id. at 12 (requesting a ""judicial declaration,"" but not providing the authority for such a 
declaration).) In Guardian's Motion, Guardian requests declaratory relief and, in support of this request, cites to both the federal 
Declaratory Judgment Act and California Code of Civil Procedure § 1060. (See Doc. 92 at 8-9.) As such, it is not clear based on 
these filings whether Guardian requests declaratory relief pursuant to the federal Declaratory Judgment Act or under California 
law. In the present action, the Court sits by diversity jurisdiction. (See, e.g., Doc. 67 ¶ 5.) Nonetheless, ""[t]he propriety of granting 
declaratory relief in federal court is a procedural question governed by federal law, even when the court's jurisdiction is based on 
diversity of citizenship."" Brosious v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., No. 15-cv-00047-KJM-DAD, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 71357, 
2015 WL 3486953, at *3 (E.D. Cal. June 2, 2015) (citing Golden Eagle Ins. Co. v. Travelers Cos., 103 F.3d 750, 753 (9th Cir.

Adobe Sys., Inc. Privacy Litig., 66 F. Supp. 3d 1197, 1219 (N.D. Cal. 2014) (finding that the federal Declaratory Judgment Act 
applied in a diversity case due to the procedural nature of declaratory judgment). The Court therefore construes Guardian's 
declaratory judgment claim in its First Counterclaim as requesting declaratory relief pursuant to the federal Declaratory 
Judgment Act and not under California law. Regardless of this procedural question, however, ""[t]he state and federal standards 
for declaratory judgment are . . . generally equivalent."" Paul Evert's RV Country, Inc. v. Universal Underwriters Ins. Co., CIV.

and Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 1060). "
1544,29," GIS argues that the Court need not reach the merits of Guardian's declaratory judgment claim pertaining to GIS's purported 
sale of dreamGUARD products. In particular, GIS asserts that ""Guardian's declaratory judgment claim as to CDFC's sale of 
[dreamGUARD] products should be immediately dismissed as duplicative of its breach of contract claims based on the exact 
same conduct."" (Doc. 104 at 12.) The Court disagrees. The Ninth Circuit has noted that HN35[
] ""[d]eclaratory relief should be denied when it will neither serve a useful purpose in 
clarifying and settling the legal relations in issue nor terminate the proceedings and afford relief from the uncertainty and 
controversy faced by the parties."" United States v. State of Wash., 759 F.2d 1353, 1357 (9th Cir. 1985) (citations omitted). As 
such, a ""proper inquiry is whether"" the claim for declaratory judgment ""serve[s] any useful purpose."" City of Lindsay v. Sociedad

(citations omitted). Ultimately, a claim for declaratory relief is only inappropriate due to redundancy if ""it is clear that there is a

65934, 2011 WL 2516159, at *3 (quoting Stickrath v. Globalstar, Inc., No. C07-1941 TEH, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 95127, 2008 
WL 2050990, at *4 (N.D. Cal. May 13, 2008)). In this case, Guardian's request for declaratory relief in the First Counterclaim pertaining to GIS's purported sale of 
dreamGUARD products and Guardian's breach of contract claims in the Second, Third, and Fourth Counterclaims do not share 
a complete identity of factual and legal issues. (See Doc. 36 ¶¶ 26-42.) GIS is correct that all of these counterclaims allege that 
GIS violated certain terms of the parties' Agreements. (See id.) However, Guardian's request for declaratory judgment goes one 
step further and requests a declaration as to ""[w]hether Guardian is entitled to immediately terminate the [Agreements] due to 
[GIS's] breaches."" (Id. ¶ 27.) As such, resolution of the breach of contract counterclaims will not fully resolve Guardian's request 
for declaratory relief in the First Counterclaim. "
1547,30," In its brief, GIS asserts that Guardian ""stay[ed] out of the business"" of producing its competing mattress protector. (Doc. 104 at 
20.) However, as GIS itself concedes, Guardian did continue to sell its mattress protectors, to some extent. (Id. at 21.) As such, 
both dreamGUARD and Guardian sold the mattress protectors at issue during the same time period."
1547,31," In its briefing, Guardian's only argument regarding this notice and cure issue is that it ""is irrelevant to the declaration sought by 
this motion."" (Doc. 111 at 7.) Defendants provide no support for this assertion. (See Doc. 111.) As provided herein, the Court 
disagrees and finds that whether Guardian complied with the notice and cure requirements is highly relevant on the issue of 
whether it may immediately terminate the Agreements."
1547,32," The Court notes that the Pennsylvania Agreement does not include a notice and cure provision applicable to breaches that are 
unrelated to quotas. (See Doc. 120, Ex. 1.) As such, the Court's analysis and finding regarding Guardian's failure to provide the 
requisite written notice and opportunity to cure the purported violation of the non-compete provision does not apply to the 
Pennsylvania Agreement. "
1549,33," As stated above, while most of the Agreements include a general definition of ""Guardian Labeled Distributor Products"" that 
may conflict with the attached product lists, the Court finds that the specific and explicitly exclusive list of products governs. See, 
e.g., Boghos v. Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's of London, 36 Cal. 4th 495, 504, 30 Cal. Rptr. 3d 787, 115 P.3d 68 (2005) (noting 
that, where ""provisions . . . are truly inconsistent,"" the ""more specific contractual provisions control over more general ones"" 
(citations omitted)). GIS also urges the Court to consider the parties' course of conduct in this analysis. However, ""California law establishes that the 
parties' course of conduct . . . 'can only be applied when the contract is ambiguous, and cannot be used when the contract is 
unambiguous.'"" Stockton Exec. Limousine Charter Serv., Inc. v. Union Pac. R.R., No. CIVS041999LKKPAN, 2006 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 25067, 2006 WL 769623, at *6 (E.D. Cal. Mar. 27, 2006) (quoting Crestview Cemetery Assn. v. Dieden, 54 Cal. 2d 744, 
754, 8 Cal. Rptr. 427, 356 P.2d 171 (1960)). In this case, all of the Agreements—with the exception of the Pennsylvania 
Agreement—unambiguously provide that, absent a relevant addendum, ""Guardian Labeled Distributor Products shall be only 
those items indicated on"" a specified exhibit ""which is attached hereto."" (Doc. 120, Ex. 2 ¶ 7; id., Ex. 3 ¶ 8; id., Ex. 4 ¶ 7(c); id., 
Ex. 5 ¶ 8; id., Ex. 6 ¶ 8; id., Ex. 7 ¶ 8; id., Ex. 8 ¶ 7; id., Ex. 9 ¶ 8.) As this language is unambiguous, the Court declines to 
consider the parties' course of conduct when making this determination. "
1550,34," The Court notes that the Pennsylvania Agreement includes two exhibits that list products. (See Doc. 120, Ex. 1 at 10-21.) 
However, unlike the remaining agreements, the Pennsylvania Agreement does not include language indicating that these 
exhibits list the products that constitute ""Guardian Labeled Distributor Products."" (See Doc. 120, Ex. 1.) "
1551,35," GIS initially argues that it is entitled to summary judgment on all of Guardian's counterclaims alleging a violation of a ""best 
efforts"" requirement because Guardian has not complied with the notice and cure provision of the Agreements. (See Doc. 123 at 
32-34.) The Court disagrees. Each of the Agreements—with the exception of the Pennsylvania Agreement—include the following notice and cure provision: Should either party be in material breach or non-compliance of any of the terms of this Agreement, the other [*124]  party 
may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice of such breach or non-compliance and the right to correct the breach. 
If the breach is not corrected or compliance is not made within sixty (60) days of the date of such notice, this Agreement 
may be terminated at the end of said sixty (60) day period. (Doc. 120, Ex. 2 ¶ 16; id., Ex. 3 ¶ 18; id., Ex. 4 ¶ 16; id., Ex. 5 ¶ 18; id., Ex. 6 ¶ 16; id., Ex. 7 ¶ 16; id., Ex. 8 ¶ 16; id., Ex. 9 ¶ 16.) 
As discussed at length above, this provision prevents Guardian from terminating these Agreements without satisfying the 
requirements related to written notice and opportunity to cure. Thus, where Guardian sought the option to terminate the 
Agreements absent the requisite written notice and opportunity to cure, the Court found that summary judgment was not 
warranted. However, Guardian's counterclaims relating to ""best efforts"" present a different situation. Specifically, Guardian's claims 
asserting a violation of a ""best efforts"" obligation do not include a request to terminate the Agreements. As such, under the plain 
language of the notice and cure provision, Guardian did not have to provide written notice and an opportunity to cure before 
asserting these counterclaims. See, e.g., Flint Emergency Med., LLC v. Macon Cty. Med. Ctr., Inc., Civil Action No. 5:12-CV-105 
(MTT), 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 142223, 2013 WL 5507279, at *8 (M.D. Ga. Oct. 2, 2013) (addressing a similar notice and cure 
provision regarding terminating the agreement and stating that ""a party that terminates the [a]greement without abiding by [the 
notice and cure provision] breaches the [a]greement with respect to the manner of its termination, but that party does not 
preclude itself from asserting other claims for breach pursuant to the [a]greement,"" ""[n]or has it undercut its ability to raise its 
opponent's breaches as a defense""). For these reasons, the Court find that GIS is not entitled to summary judgment on Guardian's counterclaims relating to a ""best 
efforts"" obligation due to Guardian's failure to comply with the Agreements' notice and cure provision. Of course, the 
Pennsylvania Agreement does not include this provision, so GIS is similarly not entitled to summary judgment on this issue 
under that agreement."
1551,36," In their briefing, Guardian implies that an express ""best efforts"" obligation is included in the Agreements based on language in 
the Agreements stating that their purpose is ""the promotion, solicitation, and sale of Guardian Labeled Distributor Products."" 
(Doc. 103 at 37.) However, the Court notes that nothing in this language imposes an express best efforts requirement. (See id.) "
1553,37," GIS also moves for summary judgment on Guardian's Sixth Counterclaim, in which Guardian alleges that GIS violated 
California Commercial Code § 2306, subdivision 2 by failing to use best efforts to promote Guardian's products. (See Doc. 123 
at 38.) GIS argues that summary judgment is warranted as to this counterclaim because (1) the Agreements do not include an 
implied best efforts obligation; and (2) Section 2306, subdivision 2 does not provide a private right of action. (Id.) As discussed herein, the Court finds that the Agreements do not include an implied obligation for GIS to use best efforts. 
Summary judgment is therefore warranted as to this counterclaim and the Court need not otherwise address GIS's additional 
argument as to whether Section 2306, subdivision 2 provides a private right of action. Accordingly, the Court GRANTS GIS's Motion, (Doc. 98), insofar as GIS requests summary judgment on Guardian's Sixth 
Counterclaim. "
1557,1," Because the Court grants AirHawk's motion on this ground, it will not examine AirHawk's additional arguments: (1) AirHawk's 
statements are puffery and (2) allegations regarding patents are not actionable under the Lanham Act. (Mot., Docket No. 52 at 
12-13.) However, the Court notes that AirHawk's puffery argument would probably fail because AirHawk's statements are 
specific. In addition, the legal precedent regarding whether patents are actionable under the Lanham Act is unsettled. See, e.g., 
Sybersound Records, Inc. v. UAV Corp., 517 F.3d 1137, 1144 (stating that the Lanham Act does not apply to the licensing status 
of a copyrighted good);  [*9]  Leisure Concepts, Inc. v. Cal. Home Spas, Inc., No. 2:14-CV-388-RMP, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
76552, 2015 WL 3658190, at *6 (E.D. Wash. June 12, 2015) (stating that ""[a]lthough Sybersound concerned the Lanham Act's 
tension with the Copyright Act, the same concern about 'overlap' exists between the Lanham Act and patent law, which is 
implicated in Leisure's unfair competition claim.""); King Tuna, Inc. v. Anova Food, Inc., No. CV-07-07451-ODW, 2011 U.S. Dist. "
1558,," LEXIS 18774, 2011 WL 839378, at *4 (C.D. Cal. Feb. 24, 2011) (stating in a findings of fact that misstatements regarding a 
patent violated the Lanham Act). "
1562,1," Under California Resources Code § 3013, ""the [CDC] director and the [DOGGR] supervisor, acting with the approval of the 
[CDC] director, shall have all powers, including the authority to adopt rules and regulations, which may be necessary to carry out 
the purposes of this division."" "
1565,2," ""Judges are not like pigs, hunting for truffles buried in briefs."" Christian Legal Soc. Chapter of University of California v. Wu, 
626 F.3d 483, 488 (9th Cir. 2010) (quoting United States v. Dunkel, 927 F.2d 955, 956 (7th Cir. 1991)). "
1568,3," Moreover, even if the judicial sham exception applied rather than the legislative one, plaintiffs have not pled sufficient grounds 
for applying that exception here. Plaintiffs' alleged injuries stem from the outcome of the government processes, the issuance of 
the permits themselves, rather than from the government process. See Manistee Town Center v. City of Glendale, 227 F.3d 
1090, 1094 (9th Cir. 2000). Although plaintiffs allege an unlawful conspiracy to obtain the permits, merely alleging the 
involvement of government officials in a conspiracy does not allow plaintiffs to circumvent the Noerr-Pennington doctrine. See 
Boone, 841 F.2d at 897. "
1569,4," In arguing that their alleged conduct brings them within the Noerr-Pennington doctrine, the government defendants rely in large 
part on the decision in Boone. In this court's view, that argument misses the mark. First, the defendant at issue in the Boone 
decision was a private development company clearly engaged in petitioning activity, not a government official. 841 F.2d at 894-
95. Second, in their pending motion to dismiss the government defendants have not articulated in what way the activity they are 
alleged to have engaged in comes within the ambit of the doctrine. "
1572,5," California Public Resources Code § 3103 reads: ""This division shall be liberally construed to meet its purposes, and the director 
and the supervisor, acting with the approval of the director, shall have all powers, including the authority to adopt rules and 
regulations, which may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this division."""
1572,6," Defendant DOGGR also argues that absolute and qualified immunity bar plaintiffs' RICO and § 1983 claims against it. (Doc. 
No. 64-1 at 25-29.) Having found that the Eleventh Amendment entirely precludes plaintiffs' claims against defendant DOGGR, 
the court need not reach the issue of whether defendant DOGGR is entitled to absolute or qualified immunity. "
1576,7," Plaintiffs with standing may seek treble damages, costs, and attorney's fees under the civil RICO statute. See 18 U.S.C. § 
1962(c). However, private parties cannot pursue injunctive relief under RICO. See Religious Tech. Ctr. v. Wollersheim, 796 F.2d 
1076, 1088 (9th Cir. 1986) (observing that ""no private equitable action"" is permitted under RICO). "
1577,8," Defendant Chevron also argues that plaintiffs' failure to allege injury or causation defeats standing, but contends that plaintiffs 
have failed to satisfy the requirements of Article III rather than those of § 1964(c) of RICO. (Doc. No. 59-1 at 15-17.) "
1581,9, Citation to this unpublished Ninth Circuit opinion is appropriate pursuant to Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3(b). 
1582,10," See n.9, above."
1582,11," The RICO statute provides that a pattern ""requires at least two acts of racketeering activity, one of which occurred after the 
effective date of this chapter and the last of which occurred within ten years (excluding any period of imprisonment) after the 
commission of a prior act of racketeering activity."" 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5). "
1583,12," Defendants Occidental, CRC, and Oviatt argue that honest services fraud cannot serve as an independent predicate offense 
under RICO, separate from the related predicate acts of wire and mail fraud. (Doc. Nos. 51 at 29; 57 at 29). However, contrary to 
defendants' arguments, the Ninth Circuit has not clearly stated this proposition. See Portfolio Investments LLC v. First Sav. 
Bank Northwest, 583 Fed. Appx. 814, 816 (9th Cir. 2014) (finding that plaintiff lacked standing to bring RICO claims, and 
specifically declining to reach the issue of whether honest-services fraud can ever serve as a predicate RICO act). But see 
United States v. Boscarino, 437 F.3d 634 (7th Cir. 2006) (stating that honest services fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1346 ""does not 
create a separate crime,"" and is a ""definitional clause"" describing a type of mail fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1341); Kolar v. "
1584,," Preferred Real Estate Investments, Inc., No. 08-3119, 361 Fed. Appx. 354, 364 n.10 (3d Cir. 2010) (describing honest services 
fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1346 as ""fall[ing] within the reach of the mail and wire fraud provisions""). Having found that plaintiff does 
not plead sufficient facts supporting a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1346, this court need not reach the issue of whether honest 
services fraud can be a separate RICO predicate offense. "
1586,13," The joint action test asks ""whether state officials and private parties have acted in concert in effecting a particular deprivation 
of constitutional rights."" Franklin, 312 F.3d at 445 (9th Cir. 2002). This requirement can be satisfied by alleging facts 
demonstrating the existence of a conspiracy between a private party and the government. Crowe v. County of San Diego, 608 
F.3d 406, 440 (9th Cir. 2010). To plead a conspiracy, a plaintiff must allege the existence of ""an agreement or meeting of the 
minds"" with a state actor to violate his constitutional rights. Crowe, 608 F.3d at 440; Margolis v. Ryan, 140 F.3d 850, 853 (9th 
Cir. 1998). The agreement need not be overt, and may be inferred on the basis of circumstantial evidence, such as if 
conspirators have committed acts that are ""unlikely to have been undertaken without an agreement."" Mendocino Envtl. Ctr. v. 
Mendocino County, 192 F.3d 1283, 1301 (9th Cir. 1999). Each of the defendants need not know the exact details of the plan, but 
every defendant must share the conspiracy's common objective. Id. (quoting United Steelworkers of Am. v. Phelps Dodge Corp., 
865 F.2d 1539, 1541 (9th Cir. 1989)); see also Trujillo v. City of Ontario, 428 F. Supp. 2d 1094, 1114 (C.D. Cal. 2006) (finding 
that a private party's ""mere acquiescence to the unconstitutional demands of a state actor is insufficient"")."
1586,14," The First Amendment provides: ""Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right 
of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."" U.S. Cons. amend. I."
1586,15," The Fifth Amendment provides: ""private property [shall not] be taken for public use, without just compensation."" U.S. Const. 
amend. V. "
1589,16," Indeed, at the hearing on the pending motion, plaintiffs' counsel conceded that the § 1985(3) claim ""is something that we are 
not fighting to keep in the lawsuit."" (Doc. No. 165 at 34.)"
1589,17," Defendants also argue that the claims brought by plaintiffs Hopkins and Wedel are barred due to failure to join necessary 
parties, and that plaintiff Hopkins' claims are time barred. Because the court has already found that the claims brought by 
plaintiffs Hopkins and Wedel fail on a number of other grounds, the court need not reach defendants' additional arguments for 
dismissal of those claims at this time."
1589,18," Although the operative pleading before the court is the FAC, it was filed by plaintiffs as a matter of right, prior to the 
appearance of any defendant in this action. (Doc. No. 16.) Therefore, this is the first order issued in this action in response to a 
motion to dismiss brought on behalf of a defendant. "
1590,19," The court acknowledges the arguments of all defendants, and particularly that made on behalf of defendant Oviatt, that 
dismissal should be with prejudice because plaintiffs cannot allege facts supporting any cognizable claims against them. As 
noted, that may be the case. However, the defendants' arguments for dismissal without leave to amend are essentially based 
upon the premise that because they did nothing actionable, amendment cannot cure the FAC's deficiencies. That is a 
presumption that the court is simply not able to engage in at this point, particularly in light of the assurances of plaintiffs' counsel 
that additional factual allegations can in good faith be made by plaintiffs in support of some of their claims. "
1604,1," AEIS was originally a joint-venture between Maritz and American Express. (Dkt. 26 at ¶ 17) In February of 2010, Maritz 
purchased the minority shares held by American Express in AEIS. (Id. at ¶ 18) After becoming the 100% owner of AEIS, Maritz

1604,3," This document is titled ""Third Amendment to Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and Waiver,"" and appears to 
be a modification of the original syndicated loan agreement. (Dkt. 26-10) "
1605,4," Wells Fargo and Northern Trusts were two institutions identified as alternative institutions participating in the syndicated loan. 
(Dkt. 26-15 at ¶ 13)"
1605,5," Florida Statute § 542.32 provides that ""[i]t is the intent of the Legislature that, in construing [Florida's antitrust laws], due 
consideration and great weight be given to the interpretations of the federal courts relating to comparable federal antitrust 
statutes."" See Amis v. Gulf Abstract & Title, Inc., 564 F. Supp. 1121 (M.D. Fla.1983), aff'd, 758 F.2d 1486 (11th Cir. 1985). "
1625,1," Citations to the trial transcript include the witness's last name in parenthesis. Where exhibits are cited with page numbers, the 
page number refers to the last three digits of the exhibit-stamp page number, where available. For example, Plaintiffs' Exhibit 
100 at page 1 is cited as ""PX0100-001."" If that pagination is not available, the last three digits of the Bates-stamp number are 
used. Expert reports are cited by paragraph number, where available."
1625,2," Based on a measure of enrollment that excludes group Medicare Advantage plans sold to employers, the government's 
economist, Dr. Aviv Nevo, asserted that Humana was the largest individual Medicare Advantage insurer in the country. 
Humana's answer admits only to being the second-largest Medicare Advantage insurer, without any reference to ""individual"" 
Medicare Advantage. See Humana's Answer [ECF No. 63] ¶ 7. For present purposes, it is not necessary to resolve this 
discrepancy. It is enough to observe that Humana has been a very large and successful player in the individual Medicare 
Advantage market—whether or not it is technically the largest one. "
1626,3," Before purchasing a MedSupp plan, some seniors may be subject medical underwriting. Depending on their answers to a 
health questionnaire, some seniors—like those with certain pre-existing conditions—may ultimately be denied MedSupp 
coverage. Tr. 106:11-17 (Frank); Tr. 429:9-17 (Cocozza). But when a senior has ""guaranteed issue rights,"" he or she cannot be 
subject to medical underwriting. Seniors have ""guaranteed issue rights"" when they age into Medicare for the first time, if their 
Medicare Advantage plan recently withdrew from the market, or if they move out of the coverage area of their Medicare 
Advantage plan. Tr. 430:8-22 (Cocozza); Tr. 722:13-20 (Wooldridge). "
1628,4," Health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and preferred provider organizations (PPOs) are both types of limited-network 
plans. HMOs typically require seniors to obtain a referral from their primary care physician before seeing a specialist. This is 
sometimes described as the primary care physician serving as a ""gatekeeper."" With limited exceptions, HMOs also do not 
reimburse seniors for care they receive outside their provider network. PPOs are usually somewhat less restrictive. PPOs 
generally do not require seniors to obtain a referral before seeing a specialist and will provide partial—but generally not full—
reimbursement for care received outside the provider network. "
1630,5," On the same day, the government filed a second complaint seeking to enjoin the Anthem-Cigna merger, citing alleged 
anticompetitive effects in markets that are mostly different than those at issue here. See Compl., Case No. 16-1493 [ECF No. 1]. 
Because the government filed the cases as related, both were initially assigned to this judge. The Court held a joint status 
conference on August 4, 2016. After concluding that the cases did not raise enough common issues to be truly related, and that 
the public would be better served if these complex and important cases seeking expedited relief were assigned to different 
judges, the Court referred the Anthem-Cigna merger for random reassignment. See Aug. 5, 2016, Order [ECF No. 39]. "
1632,6," The county is the relevant geographic market because seniors may enroll only in Medicare Advantage plans offered in the 
county where they live. PX0551 (Nevo Report) ¶ 88; Tr. 393:25-394:10 (Cocozza) "
1633,7," Although the Guidelines are not binding, the D.C. Circuit and other courts have looked to them for guidance in previous merger 
cases. See, e.g., Heinz, 246 F.3d at 716 n. 9; Sysco, 113 F. Supp. 3d at 38. "
1634,8," Defendants contend this provision amounts to a Congressional determination, binding on this Court, ""that Original Medicare is 
an appropriate and adequate substitute for Medicare Advantage for every Medicare-eligible consumer."" Defs.' Proposed 
Findings & Conclusions at 103. While the Court does not take this statutory language lightly, it does not consider the language 
determinative of the antitrust issues in this case."
1634,9," Some seniors, like those with certain disabilities or chronic conditions, may be eligible for eligibility-restricted Medicare options. 
Because they do not face the same choice between Original Medicare and Medicare Advantage as the average senior, they 
have largely been excluded from the analysis in this case. When these seniors are included in the analysis, the share of seniors 
in Original Medicare options grows larger. "
1636,10," The place for ""Other[s]"" in these documents refers to other Medicare Advantage providers, not to Original Medicare or 
MedSupp. "
1637,11," Many of defendants' documents concerning Medicare Advantage reference a ""penetration rate,"" which reflects the share of 
Medicare-eligible seniors who select Medicare Advantage over Original Medicare in a particular location. Usually, however, 
these references do not herald concrete competitive steps to be taken vis-à-vis some specific MedSupp plan or other Original 
Medicare option. As a result, in the Court's view, penetration rates are more appropriately interpreted as a statistic used to 
assess the size of the Medicare Advantage market. "
1638,12," The government offered expert testimony by Dr. Gary Ford, who was retained to assess the reliability of this Humana study. 
According to Ford, the study is reliable. Tr. 912:22-913:1 (Ford). "
1641,13," Seniors who are still employed when they turn 65 may not have to make an individualized choice between Medicare 
Advantage and Original Medicare. Instead, they may be offered a group plan by their employer, which falls on one side of the 
line or the other. See Tr. 116:18-24 (Frank) (describing employer-provided MedSupp plans that wrap around Original Medicare); 
Tr. 1119:14 - 20 (Cavanaugh) (describing group Medicare Advantage plans). "
1643,14," Before embarking on his economic analysis, Nevo reviewed much of the relevant evidence in this case, including the parties' 
ordinary course of business documents and the switching data. It is not necessary to summarize Nevo's conclusions regarding 
that evidence. It will suffice to note that Nevo believes that evidence also points to the existence of a market for individual 
Medicare Advantage plans. See Tr. 1618:13-1619:9 (Nevo). "
1644,15," The parties agree that ""margin"" is a somewhat fraught concept, which can vary depending on the context. As explained by 
several witnesses, there are important differences between economic margins, underwriting margins, and profit margins, so one 
must be careful about drawing quick comparisons between ""margin"" figures. Aware of that danger here, Orszag has not simply 
compared Nevo's ""economic margin"" estimates to the ""margin"" cap in the medical loss regulations and decided that Nevo's 
margins are too high. Instead, he has constructed an argument that the medical loss regulations imply a cap on economic 
margins of 15%. See Tr. 3186:2-16 (Orszag)."
1644,16," Nevo also performed his critical loss analysis using estimates derived from the academic paper that found the lowest nesting 
parameter. The Medicare Advantage product market also passed these iterations of the hypothetical monopolist test. See 
PX0551 (Nevo Report) ¶ 180 & n.251. "
1645,17," It is true that, when Nevo uses Orszag's estimates, a small number of complaint counties do not pass the hypothetical 
monopolist test with a Medicare Advantage market. If these iterations of Nevo's tests were the only market definition evidence in 
the record, the Court might conclude that the government had not proven a valid market with respect to those counties. But 
these iterations of the test are not the only evidence in the record. The ordinary course of business documents and Brown Shoe 
factors point strongly to the existence of a Medicare Advantage market. "
1646,18," It would also require (somewhat counter-intuitively) grouping together as one product all the possible combinations of Original 
Medicare, MedSupp, and Part D plans."
1646,19," There is some indication in the record that, given the compressed schedule in this case (adopted largely at the companies' 
request), CMS could not timely provide the data necessary to perform those calculations. "
1647,20," Orszag also finds no correlation between concentration and MAO margins. Although the companies refer to this conclusion 
several times in multiple sections of their brief, they have not persuasively explained its relevance. In the Court's view, the 
important part of Orszag's analysis concerns the relationship between concentration and price. "
1648,21," The government also argues that Orszag's regression is not a proper hypothetical monopolist test because it incorporates 
""supply side"" factors like the effects of entry and the existence of regulation. Because the Court finds the government's 
econometric critique to be persuasive, it need not address this argument. "
1651,22," Aetna and Humana note that they each compete with a number of other Medicare Advantage organizations in Raleigh and 
San Antonio, not only with one another. True enough. But that does not change the fact that these markets would be highly 
concentrated post-merger, nor does it directly rebut the government's evidence that direct competition between them has 
previously driven plan improvements. "
1652,23," When Nevo performs this merger simulation using estimates derived from Orszag's nested logit model, he likewise predicts 
premium increases. All eight merger simulations predict premium increases of at least 9%. PX0552 (Nevo Reply Report) ¶ 84 & 
Ex. 12; Tr. 1630:9-17 (Nevo). "
1653,24," Even after revising the bid, the MAO could still be the subject of a CMS compliance notice. Tr. 1942:8-17 (Paprocki). "
1654,25," The meaningful difference rule does not apply to two plans of different types (for example, an HMO and a PPO) or plans 
offered under different contracts. See Tr. 2009:22-2012:5 (Paprocki)."
1654,26," The companies argue that they would strive to avoid creating plans with medical loss ratios less than 85%. To compensate for 
a plan below 85%, the merged company would need to have another plan in the same contract above 85%. That comparatively 
richer plan could in turn attract a high number of beneficiaries, ultimately costing the company money. See DX0014-162; Tr. "
1655,2017," :15-2018:15 (Paprocki). That might be possible but, in the Court's view, is far too remote to show that the medical loss ratio 
regulations impose a meaningful constraint on the prices of particular plans."
1655,27," There is some indication in the record that CMS may have the discretion to change this threshold. Tr. 1188:16-18 
(Cavanaugh). But as far as the Court is aware, no such change is on the horizon. "
1660,28," Neither of Nevo's reports used Orszag's ""corrected"" definition, with a 5% threshold, to calculate the probability that all new 
entrants combined would replace the lost competition. "
1661,29," The government points out that Orszag used 2012 through 2016 data when determining the likelihood of entry, but only used 
2013 through 2016 data when evaluating the success of that entry. Pls.' Proposed Findings & Conclusions at 129. The 
government argues that this is Orszag's attempt to present the data in a misleading manner: 2012 saw more entry than most 
subsequent years, and 2012 entrants failed at a significantly higher rate than entrants in subsequent years. Id.; DX0419 (Orszag 
Report) ¶ 128 & Table II-10 (more entrants in 2012 than in most subsequent years); Tr. 3287:5-3288:14 (Orszag) 
(acknowledging that he did not use 2012 data and that those entrants failed at a higher rate). But for the complaint counties, 
there were fewer entrants in 2012 than in subsequent years, making the effect of excluding 2012 from the data unclear. See 
DX0419 (Orszag Report) ¶ 128 & Table II-10. Regardless, it is not necessary to evaluate the implications of omitting 2012 data 
from some of Orszag's analyses. "
1662,30," This opinion uses the term ""Molina"" to refer to the corporate entity. The Court heard testimony from Molina's CEO, Dr. Mario 
Molina (Dr. Molina), and the CFO, John Molina (Mr. Molina). "
1663,31," There are some discrepancies in Molina's enrollment data, stemming from whether data for the 2015 plan year is used, or 
more recent but unverified data from the 2016 plan year is used. For example, Molina's 2015 annual report stated it had 3.5 
million members, PX0230 at 2, while Mr. Molina testified that it currently has 4.2 million members, Tr. 956:4-6 (Mr. Molina), and 
Dr. Molina testified that it has 4.3 million members, Tr. 2204:19-25 (Dr. Molina). These discrepancies are not important to the 
analysis."
1663,32," Again, other documents, including Molina's 2015 annual report, state that Molina offers plans in 11 states plus Puerto Rico. 
See PX0230 at 2."
1663,33," The transcript also states ""$3.09 million"" but that is a transcription error. See Tr. 2295:8-11 (Dr. Molina). "
1666,34," Burns notes that Aetna is not offering Medicare Advantage plans in 2017 in 2 of the 364 complaint counties. See PX0559 
(Burns Report) ¶ 11 n.1. This opinion continues to use the number 364, rather than 362, for clarity and consistency. Burns' 
reports, and some portions of the transcript, refer to 362 rather than 364 counties. "
1667,35," One document suggests that for counties where Molina already has a Medicare network through its dual-eligible plans, it 
would not need to submit network adequacy information in February. See PX0090-195 (""The beauty of existing states and 
service areas [is] we avoid the Feb Firedrill[.] we just have to deliver by bid time[.]""). In that case, Molina would have 
approximately 16 months, rather than 12 months, to build a network in the 15 complaint counties where it has D-SNP and MMP 
plans. This would not change the Court's analysis. "
1674,36," The companies, of course, also contend that Aetna's decision was not made to improve its ligation position. "
1675,37," Polygram was not asserting HN29[
] the ""failing company"" defense, which is an affirmative defense to a section 7 violation. Id. at 1164 (citing Int'l Shoe, 280 U.S. at 302). "
1676,38, The Court expresses no opinion on whether actual potential competition is a viable antitrust theory. 
1677,39," The parties spend significant pages arguing about the import of FTC v. Libbey, Inc., 211 F. Supp. 2d 34 (D.D.C. 2002). That 
case is only marginally relevant. In Libbey, the merging parties revised their agreement after the FTC decided to seek an 
injunction to identify a proposed divestiture in an attempt to alleviate some of the FTC's concerns. 211 F. Supp. 2d at 42 n.21. 
The court noted that the revisions were not an attempt ""to evade FTC and judicial review,"" but rather to alleviate anticompetitive 
effects of the merger. Id. at 46. Like the proposed divestiture to Molina in this case, the parties' there attempted to alleviate the 
anticompetitive effects of the merger through a divestiture, and that proposed divestiture was then reviewed by the court. The 
Libbey court likewise noted that some parties might revise an agreement in an ""unscrupulous[] attempt to avoid judicial review 
and FTC review,"" but did not discuss how it would approach that problem given that it did not arise. See id. at 46 n.27. Thus, 
Libbey provides little guidance concerning the proper approach here."
1677,40," The Hart-Scott-Rodino Act of 1976, 15 U.S.C. § 18a, requires firms to alert the Department of Justice and the FTC before 
certain mergers are consummated, and allow time for the government to conduct an investigation and seek an injunction pre-
consummation. See Bazaarvoice, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3284, 2014 WL 203966, at *75 (explaining effect of Act). Pre- and post-
merger suits are routinely analyzed identically. See, e.g., Baker Hughes, 908 F.2d at 987 (relying on pre-and post-merger 
cases); H&R Block, 833 F. Supp. 2d at 51-52. "
1679,41," On July 21, 2016, Humana announced that it would only offer on-exchange plans for 2017 in 11 states, rather than the 15 
where it offered on-exchange plans in 2016. Humana's announcement did not affect any of the counties identified in the 
complaint, and there is no allegation that Humana's decision was related to this litigation. "
1680,42," At trial, Lynch explained that this statement expressed her concern that Aetna should be transparent in its decision-making 
process, rather than reflecting an attempt to shield its decision-making process from discovery. Tr. 1491:23-24 (Lynch). The 
Court does not credit this explanation."
1680,43," Due to time constraints, Aetna believed that if it wanted to withdraw from those 17 counties, it needed to withdraw from those 
three states entirely, and so, the team recommended it do so. Tr. 1518:12-1519:2 (Mayhew). "
1681,44," There are other attributes of the markets that, the parties essentially agree, contributed to this costlier-than-expected pool of 
insurance purchasers. For example, under the ""Keep What You Have Program,"" consumers who purchased insurance pre-ACA 
were able to keep it, and thus did not enter the exchange markets. These consumers were largely healthier (in part because, 
pre-ACA, individual insurance was only available to relatively healthy individuals). See Tr. 2674:9-2675:6 (Guertin); Tr. 1379:20-
1380:10 (Bertolini); Tr. 1829:21-1830:4 (Broussard); DX0150-001. Part of this program expires at the end of 2017. Tr. 2740:25-
2741:17 (Guertin); Tr. 1436:1-5 (Bertolini). Likewise, CMS adopted relaxed rules permitting consumers to purchase insurance 
during ""special enrollment periods"" outside of the annual open enrollment period. Tr. 1830:5-12 (Broussard); Tr. 1373:15-
1374:16 (Bertolini); DX0302-011; DX0019-005. This functionally allowed consumers to buy plans when they were sick and "
1682,," cancel them when they were healthy. See Tr. 1830:5-12 (Broussard). CMS has recently tightened these rules. Tr. 1433:2-22 
(Bertolini); Tr. 2650:9-2651:1 (Counihan); DX0158-002. "
1684,45," Defendants ask the Court to take notice of political uncertainty regarding potential legislative changes to the ACA. See, e.g., 
Exec. Order (January 20, 2017) ""Minimizing The Economic Burden of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act Pending 
Repeal"" (directing agencies to minimize regulatory burdens, but not identifying any specific legislative or executive actions to be 
undertaken). Although there may be political uncertainty and changes to the ACA may well be coming, it is always within "
1685,," Congress' power to change the law. HN37[
] A court has no ability to predict Congress's actions, nor is it the judiciary's place 
to do so. See Worth v. Jackson, 451 F.3d 854, 862, 371 U.S. App. D.C. 339 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (quoting Texas v. United States, 
523 U.S. 296, 301, 118 S. Ct. 1257, 140 L. Ed. 2d 406 (1998)). This Court must apply the law to the facts at hand given the legal 
framework that exists now. Cf. United States v. Microsoft Corp., 253 F.3d 34, 50, 346 U.S. App. D.C. 330 (D.C. Cir. 2001) 
(potential for technological change to upend market ""does not appreciably alter our mission in assessing the alleged antitrust 
violations"")."
1685,46," The government introduced evidence relevant to market concentration and anticompetitive effects in all 17 complaint counties. 
Because the Court has not found that Aetna is likely to compete in the counties in Georgia or Missouri in the near future, the 
Court only considers the evidence relevant to the counties in Florida."
1685,47," Nevo also conducted a regression analysis to demonstrate the relationship between market concentration and price. He found 
that premiums increase as market concentration increases, and that the relationship is statistically significant. PX0551 (Nevo 
Report) ¶¶ 322-23, Ex. 35; Tr. 1692:18-1693:8 (Nevo). Although this analysis confirms the rationale behind using HHI, 
demonstrating a relationship between price and concentration is not necessary to establishing the government's prima facie 
case or to its ultimate burden of persuasion. "
1686,48," The government also raises other criticisms of Orszag's regression analysis and therefore his HHI calculation. Because the 
Court is not persuaded by this rebuttal argument, the Court does not reach those points. "
1688,49," Gokhale's opinion relates only to those efficiencies claimed from 2020 onward. The companies do not claim savings prior to 
that date. Tr. 2923:1-7 (Gokhale); Tr. 3399:25-3400:3 (Hammer). "
1689,50," Reductions in fixed costs are even less likely to be passed on to consumers. According to the Guidelines, ""[e]fficiencies 
relating to costs that are fixed in the short term are unlikely to benefit customers in the short term."" Guidelines § 10 n. 15. 
Moreover, efficiencies ""such as those relating to procurement, management, or capital cost[] are less likely to be merger-specific 
or substantial, or may not be cognizable for other reasons."" Id. at § 10. The companies cite $919 million in these kinds of 
efficiencies, including the ""efficiencies to be gained from eliminating overlapping infrastructure, like IT services, as well as 
eliminating overlap in procurement services and the lower costs obtained by moving the merged entity onto lower cost 
procurement contracts."" Defs.' Proposed Findings & Conclusions at 98."
1689,51," During Hammer's cross-examination, counsel for Aetna asked her whether Exhibit 15 to Gokhale's reply report represented an 
attempt to allocate efficiencies to the challenged markets. Tr. 3465:20-3466:12 (Hammer); see also DX0577 (Gokhale Reply 
Report) Ex. 15. Although Hammer agreed that Exhibit 15 did reflect such an attempt, Aetna and Humana make no use of this 
exchange or the underlying exhibit. Without further explanation of this exhibit's significance, if any, the Court cannot rely on it 
here. "
1695,1," Plaintiffs refer collectively throughout the FAC to the CP Defendants as CP Foods and do not clearly distinguish between these 
two defendants."
1695,2, California Civil Code § 1714.43.
1695,3, Each of these cases is currently on appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.
1695,4," The CP Defendants also move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, which is their primary argument, lack of statutory 
standing and failure to state a claim. The CP Defendants also argue that the Court should equitably abstain from adjudicating 
this case, and Costco joined in that argument. "
1696,5," Plaintiffs also rely on Colucci v. ZonePerfect Nutrition Company, No. 12-CV-2907-SC, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 183050, 2012 WL 
6737800 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 28, 2012). In that case, the court dismissed claims of one of the plaintiffs, because he failed to allege 
he purchased the defendant's product. Id., 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 183050, 2012 WL 6737800, at *5."
1696,6," To the extent Plaintiffs rely on allegations of agency, conspiracy, aiding and abetting, and concerted actions to show they were 
injured by the CP Defendants, those allegations are mere legal conclusions couched as fact. (See FAC ¶¶ 48-50.) Cf. Easter, 
381 F.3d at 962 (concluding plaintiffs failed to establish a juridical link between defendants)."
1696,7," For that same reason, and assuming the Court could assert personal jurisdiction over either Charoen or CP Foods, Plaintiffs 
lack statutory standing under the UCL. Because they have not alleged they purchased prawns produced by either of the CP 
Defendants, they have not alleged facts showing they lost money or property as a result of the CP Defendants' conduct. "
1699,8," The standard is the same under the FAL. See Colgan, 135 Cal. App. 4th at 680."
1699,9," Although Gray is unpublished, the Court finds it instructive. The Ninth Circuit concluded the plaintiffs could not state a claim 
under the UCL or the CLRA, on a pure omissions theory, where they alleged the defendant failed to disclose internal fuel 
economy data, which plaintiffs alleged was contrary to EPA estimates. Gray, 554 Fed. Appx. at 609. The Gray court reasoned 
""California law instructs that a manufacturer's duty to its consumers is limited to its warranty, unless a safety issue is present or 
there has been some affirmative misrepresentation."" Id."
1699,10," In Falk, the court held a failure to disclose can constitute actionable fraud under the CLRA in four circumstances: ""(1) when the 
defendant is in a fiduciary relationship with the plaintiff; (2) when the defendant had exclusive knowledge of material facts not 
known to the plaintiff; (3) when the defendant actively conceals a material fact from the plaintiff; and (4) when the defendant 
makes partial representations but also suppresses some material fact."" Id., 496 F. Supp. 2d at 1095 (quoting LiMandri v. 
Judkins, 52 Cal. App. 4th 326, 336-37, 60 Cal. Rptr. 2d 539 (1997)). "
1700,11," The McCoy court also decided the Dana case, cited above. Because the Court's reasoning in Dana is substantially similar to, if 
not identical to the reasoning in McCoy, which is published, this Court has relied on McCoy. "
1706,1," To the extent any of these facts are disputed, they are not material to the disposition of this motion. In addition, to the extent 
that the Court has relied on evidence to which the parties have objected, the Court has considered and overruled those 
objections. As to the remaining objections, the Court finds that it is unnecessary to rule on those objections because the 
disputed evidence was not relied on by the Court. "
1707,2," As a result of a Settlement and Release Agreement executed on December 19, 2014, Plaintiffs' Second Amended Complaint is 
limited to Defendants' acts since January 1, 2015 (hereinafter, the ""Covered Period"")."
1707,3," Haymon Sports waived this provision in May 2016 pursuant to a settlement agreement with another promoter, Top Rank, which 
resulted in a dismissal of a related case in this Court, Top Rank, Inc. v. Alan Haymon, et al., Case No. CV 15-4961-JFW 
(MRWx) (C.D. Cal.). "
1708,4," The Court recently became aware from newspaper articles that another fight between a Haymon-advised boxer and a Golden 
Boy-promoted boxer was announced — Canelo Alvarez v. Julio Cesar Chavez Jr., scheduled for May 6, 2017. This fight is being 
touted, and will undoubtedly will be promoted, as the ""biggest all-Mexican fight in boxing history."""
1708,5," NBC rejected Haymon Sports' proposal despite the fact that it had paid license fees to Main Events for its ""NBC Sports Fight 
Night Series"" as recently as 2013 and 2014."
1708,6," Haymon Sports does not pay for air time on BounceTV, nor does it receive a license fee. Instead, they have a ""revenue share"" 
agreement."
1708,7," There were some exceptions to the exclusivity provisions. For example, the Spanishlanguage Fox affiliate, Fox Deportes, was 
not contractually precluded from exhibiting boxing programming provided by another supplier. Similarly, local ABC affiliates were 
not precluded from exhibiting boxing programming provided by another supplier. "
1709,8," The Ali Act, enacted in 2000, requires a ""firewall"" between managers and promoters. It makes it unlawful for ""a promoter to 
have a direct or indirect financial interest in the management of a boxer;"" or ""a manager—(i) to have a direct or indirect financial 
interest in the promotion of a boxer; or ""(ii) to be employed by or receive compensation or other benefits from a promoter, except 
for amounts received as consideration under the manager's contract with the boxer."" 15 U.S.C. § 6308."
1709,9," Although Defendants deny that Haymon Sports acts as a promoter, Haymon Sports has indicated that, at some point in the 
future, it may decide to become a promoter."
1709,10," Although the Court recognizes that there is a genuine dispute as to whether Defendants act as promoters, this dispute does 
not preclude the Court from granting summary judgment as to Plaintiffs' federal claims for relief. "
1710,11," For several years prior to 2015, Golden Boy had a long term deal pursuant to which 24 Golden Boy events per year were 
telecast on Fox Deportes in Spanish, and simulcast on Fox Sports 1 in English. Golden Boy received a license fee for these 
events."
1710,12," In addition, after Haymon Sports waived the exclusivity provisions in all of its television contracts, Golden Boy entered into 
negotiations with ESPN for a multi-year deal. "
1711,13," ""Per se liability is reserved for only those agreements that are 'so plainly anticompetitive that no elaborate study of the industry 
is needed to establish their illegality.'"" Texaco v. Dagher, 547 U.S. 1, 5, 126 S. Ct. 1276, 164 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2006) (quoting Nat'l 
Soc'y of Prof'l Eng'rs v. United States, 435 U.S. 679, 692, 98 S. Ct. 1355, 55 L. Ed. 2d 637 (1978)). Although tying arrangements 
may also be analyzed under the ""rule of reason,"" Plaintiffs have not relied on the ""rule of reason"" in their Oppositions to 
Defendants' Motions for Summary judgment. Even if Plaintiffs had relied on that theory, the Court would have still granted 
summary judgment. "
1712,14," Plaintiffs do not appear to contend that Haymon Sports' management contracts constitute an express tie. Regardless, such a 
claim would fail because Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that Defendants had sufficient economic power to coerce boxers 
into accepting the tie at the time the boxers entered into these contracts. See infra Section III.A.2. "
1713,15," In fact, the evidence suggests that it is Golden Boy, not Defendants, that has refused to deal with the Haymon Entities during 
the pendency of this lawsuit. Indeed, in May 2015, Robert Diaz (Golden Boy's matchmaker) received a suggestion from the 
manager of then Golden Boy-promoted heavyweight, Luis Ortiz, to try to place Mr. Ortiz in a bout that is featured within a PBC 
show. Mr. Diaz responded, ""Are you serious? You do know we have sued Haymon right?""."
1713,16," To establish the existence of the tie, Plaintiffs also rely on the fact that four boxers terminated their promotional agreements 
with Golden Boy pursuant to a January 2015 settlement agreement with Defendants. However, the settlement agreement 
expressly contemplated the termination of these four agreements and Golden Boy was paid handsomely for these terminations 
in accordance with the agreement. The Court does not consider this negotiated settlement evidence of a tie. In addition, Golden 
Boy relies on the fact that other Haymon-managed fighters terminated their promotional contracts with Golden Boy pursuant to 
""key man"" clauses in their contracts (or merely let their contracts expire). Not only did these terminations occur outside of the 
Covered Period, Golden Boy merely speculates as to the reasons for these terminations. "
1715,17," A common method for determining the relevant market is the ""hypothetical monopolist test."" Saint Alphonsus Med. Ctr.-Nampa 
Inc. v. St. Luke's Health Sys., Ltd., 778 F.3d 775, 784 (9th Cir. 2015). The test asks whether ""a hypothetical monopolist could 
impose a 'small but significant nontransitory increase in price' (""SSNIP"") in the proposed market."" Id. ""If enough consumers 
would respond to a SSNIP by purchasing the product from outside the proposed . . . market, making the SSNIP unprofitable, the 
proposed market definition is too narrow."" Id."
1715,18," Although Dr. Kneuper in his deposition and in his declaration attempts to elaborate on his reasoning, he provides absolutely 
no evidentiary support for his conclusion that foreign managers should not be included in the market. For example, although Dr. 
Kneuper testified at his deposition that foreign managers would not provide a ""sufficient enough constraint . . . to defeat the 
hypothetical monopoly test,"" see Kneuper Dep. 171:17-173:2, Dr. Kneuper did not provide any empirical data to justify this 
conclusion. Moreover, although he testified that foreign-managed Championship-Caliber Boxers only have a limited television 
presence in the U.S., see Kneuper Dep. 248:25-249:16, this fact is not a sufficient basis to exclude foreign managers from the 
market, especially given that these foreign-managed boxers meet the television filters he applied to define a Championship-
Caliber Boxer. If Dr. Kneuper truly believed a single appearance on U.S. television since January 1, 2015 was insufficient to 
demonstrate that the boxer had economic value, he should have modified his filters and re-applied them to both U.S.-managed 
Championship-Caliber Boxers and foreign-managed Championship-Caliber Boxers. "
1718,19," The Court also notes that the majority of Haymon Sports' management services contracts were signed prior to January 1, 
2015, before the PBC was ever announced and before the majority of the television agreements were signed. At that time, there 
were no conceivable barriers to entry in the management market, evidencing that boxers signed the Haymon Sports' 
management services contracts with the consent clause, not because of Haymon Sports' market power or coercion, but because 
Haymon Sports offered boxers better service and better compensation."
1718,20," For the reasons stated supra, Plaintiffs have failed establish their tying claim, and thus cannot support its Section 2 claim with 
such conduct. In addition, to the extent that Plaintiffs have raised a ""refusal to deal"" claim, that claim fails for the reasons stated 
in the Haymon Entities' Motion and Reply. "
1719,21," Furthermore, the Court notes that Defendants waived all of the exclusivity provisions in their television agreements in May 
2016, and Golden Boy and other promoters are now able to negotiate with these networks. In fact, Golden Boy has entered into 
negotiations with ESPN for a multi-year deal."
1719,22," Plaintiffs also argue that Defendants' exclusive management contracts with boxers are anticompetitive, because Defendants 
have used these contracts to terminate promotional agreements with Plaintiffs and to prevent their fighters from entering into 
such agreements. As discussed supra, the Court has concluded that Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that Defendants have 
prevented boxers from working with Golden Boy and other promoters. "
1722,23," In the Pretrial Conference Order, Defendants agree that the Court should decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over 
Plaintiffs' state law claims. See Final Pretrial Conference Order [Docket No. 323-1] (""Defendants believe that the Court should 
decline to exercise supplemental subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c) if the first, second, and third causes of 
action are dismissed.""). "
1727,1," Hawai'i Gas also argues that any allegations of contractual violations must cite the specific contractual provisions. [Mem. in 
Supp. of Motion at 9 n.1.] It is clear from the Counterclaim, however, that Amerigas does not bring a breach of contract claim. "
1728,2," As part of its argument regarding fraud, Hawai'i Gas states that it ""cannot even frame a response to the Counterclaim with 
respect to the applicable statutes of limitations, as Amerigas provides no timeframe for the supposed bad acts."" [Mem. in Supp. 
of Motion at 11 n.3.] The Counterclaim is not a paragon of clarity and precision. However, nothing in the record at present 
precludes Hawai'i Gas from making a good faith argument that the relevant statute of limitations applies in the instant matter. 
The Court also notes that the conduct alleged in the Counterclaim includes issues related to the automatic renewal of contracts. 
As such, it is unlikely that a statute of limitations defense would be successful. "
1729,3," Hawai'i Gas also appears to argue that Amerigas does not have standing to bring Counterclaim I because Hawai'i Gas is not 
the proximate cause of Amerigas's harm. [Reply at 9-13.] Hawai'i Gas made this argument for the first time in its reply, and it 
must therefore be rejected. See Local Rule LR7.4 (""Any argument raised for the first time in the reply shall be disregarded.""). 
Even if Hawai'i Gas had made this argument in an earlier filing, it would be unavailing. In the case that Hawai'i Gas cites to 
support its position, Association of Washington Public Hospital Districts v. Phillip Morris Inc. (""Washington Hospital"" [*17] ), the 
plaintiffs filed suit against a number of tobacco companies for, inter alia, violation of federal antitrust law. 241 F.3d 696, 700 
(9th Cir. 2001). In Washington Hospital, the Ninth Circuit held that the plaintiffs did not have federal antitrust standing because 
""they [were] attempting to recover for harm that is derivative of personal injuries visited upon their patients."" Id. at 703. Moreover, 
the plaintiffs' injuries occurred in a separate market than that within which competition was allegedly being restrained. Id. at 705 
(citation omitted). Here, not only is Amerigas's injury in the same market as that in which competition is allegedly being 
restrained - namely, the LPG market - but Amerigas also states a direct injury to its business. See supra Section I."
1729,4," The Court notes that: In Robert's Hawai'i, [the Hawai'i Supreme Court] . . . held that ""there is no private claim for relief under [Haw. Rev. Stat.] § 
480-13 for unfair methods of competition in violation of [Haw. Rev. Stat.] § 480-2."" 91 Hawai'i at 252, 982 P.2d at 881. 
Thereafter, in 2002, the legislature amended [Haw. Rev. Stat.] § 480-2 to add subsection (e) which makes clear there is 
such a private right. 2002 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 229, § 2 at 916-17. In Hawai'i Med. Ass'n v. Hawai'i Med. Services Ass'n, 
113 Hawai'i 77, 107 148 P.3d 1179, 1209 (2006), [the Hawai'i Supreme Court] held that ""[w]e do not believe the 
amendment 'overruled' Robert's Hawai'i . . . but instead simply provided a new right that did not previously exist."" Davis, 122 Hawai'i at 427 n. 9, 228 P.3d at 307 n.9 (some alterations in Davis). "
1734,1," The strictly intrastate nature of the alleged relevant market poses no issue concerning the Sherman Act's interstate 
jurisdictional requirement, as ""[Plaintiffs] need not make the more particularized showing of an effect on interstate commerce 
caused by the alleged[ly anticompetitive activity of Defendants]."" McLain v. Real Estate Bd. of New Orleans, Inc., 444 U.S. 232, 
242-43, 100 S. Ct. 502, 62 L. Ed. 2d 441 (1980); Shahawy v. Harrison, 778 F.2d 636, 640 (11th Cir. 1985), amended, 790 F.2d 
75 (11th Cir. 1986) (""In other words, an elaborate analysis of interstate impact is not necessary at the jurisdictional stage, only 
an allegation showing a logical connection as a matter of practical economics between the unlawful conduct and interstate 
commerce.""). "
1737,2," This quoted text would seem to provide strong support for the dentists' claim that teeth whitening constituted the unauthorized 
practice of dentistry — a claim that, as discussed below, the Fourth Circuit did not consider an impediment to its ruling."
1737,3," In an introductory comment, the Supreme Court noted that, ""[t]he Act does not specify that teeth whitening is 'the practice of 
dentistry.'"" N.C. State Bd. of Dental Exam'rs v. F.T.C.,     U.S.    ,    , 135 S. Ct. 1101, 1104, 191 L. Ed. 2d 35 (2015). "
1742,4," None of the cases that Defendants cite for this proposition are antitrust cases. Specifically, ""in antitrust cases . . . dismissals 
prior to giving the plaintiff ample opportunity for discovery should be granted very sparingly."" Hosp. Bldg. Co. v. Trustees of Rex 
Hosp., 425 U.S. 738, 746, 96 S. Ct. 1848, 48 L. Ed. 2d 338 (1976). The reason for any alleged lost profits depends upon the 
knowledge and actions within a relevant market involving third parties. As a result, this court does not find allegations made 
""upon information and belief"" as to damages to be a basis for dismissal in this case. "
1744,5," Plaintiffs note that ""[t]he Board incorporates 12 pages of substantive argument from its December 22, 2015 motion-to-dismiss 
brief . . . for a total of 32 pages"" and that ""[t]he Board's 32-page brief violates this Court's Local Rules."" (Pls.' Resp. (Doc. 28) at 
2 n.1.) Local Rule 7.3(d) explicitly states that ""[b]riefs in support of motions and responsive briefs are limited in length to 20 
pages, and reply briefs are limited to 10 pages."" LR7.3(d) (emphasis added). This court agrees with Plaintiffs that Defendants' 
incorporation is not permitted by the rules."
1744,6," This court notes that simply alleging the existence of a Constitutional right in a complaint (here, the purported right to continue 
performing dry needling) is not sufficient, even for purposes of a 12(b)(6) motion, to establish such a right. Doing so would 
constitute pleading a ""legal conclusion"" under Iqbal, which the court is not required to accept as true. See Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678-
79. "
1756,1," Accordingly, we need not, and so do not, reach Defendants' alternative arguments that Buccaneer's claims are barred by res 
judicata, the statute of limitations, and release."
1756,2, We include as background only the facts and procedural history relevant to the issues we address. 
1757,3," Petrox purchased 5,750 leasehold acres in 2000. The extent of WillSource's holdings is not readily apparent, but the parties 
agree that WillSource owned leases during the relevant time period."
1757,4," Sometime later, GEC and SG each built a lateral gas-gathering pipeline off of the RM System—known as the Sheep Park Gas 
Lateral Pipeline and the Henderson gathering line, respectively. GEC and SG owned and operated these lines independently. "
1758,5," Evidence in the record shows that, throughout its course of dealing with Buccaneer, GEC was consulting with SG or otherwise 
keeping SG informed."
1758,6," Petrox and WillSource each has its own history of transportation negotiations with Defendants. WillSource entered into an 
agreement on July 30, 2008, to transport gas on the RM System at a rate of $2 per MMBtu; however, WillSource never actually 
transported gas under that agreement. WillSource also reached an agreement to transport gas on the Bull Mountain Pipeline but 
has not transported gas under that agreement either. Petrox sought a transportation agreement on the RM System throughout 
the summer of 2013 but never entered into one. Instead, Petrox eventually secured an agreement to transport gas on the Bull 
Mountain Pipeline."
1758,7," A panel of this court later affirmed the dismissal. Riviera Drilling & Expl. Co. v. Gunnison Energy Corp., 412 F. App'x 89 (10th 
Cir. 2011) (unpublished)."
1758,8," Buccaneer brought three additional claims—tortious interference with contract, and attempted monopolization and 
monopolization under § 2 of the Sherman Act—but those claims have since been dismissed or withdrawn and are not at issue 
on appeal. "
1759,9," In light of our conclusion on the merits, we need not and therefore do not address the separate issue of antitrust standing, 
which despite the name is not a jurisdictional requirement. See Verizon Commc'ns Inc. v. Law Offices of Curtis V. Trinko, LLP, 
540 U.S. 398, 416 n.5, 124 S. Ct. 872, 157 L. Ed. 2d 823 (2004) (stating, after having rejected a § 2 claim on the merits, that it 
was ""unnecessary to consider [defendant]'s alternative contention that [plaintiff] lacks antitrust standing""); 2A Phillip E. Areeda et 
al., Antitrust Law ¶ 335f, at 89 (4th ed. 2014) (""When a court concludes that no violation [of the antitrust laws] has occurred, it 
has no occasion to consider [antitrust] standing.""); cf. Sullivan v. DB Invs., Inc., 667 F.3d 273, 307 (3d Cir. 2011) (""[S]tatutory 
standing is simply another element of proof for an antitrust claim, rather than a predicate for asserting a claim in the first place.""). 
For purposes of our analysis here, we assume Buccaneer has antitrust standing. "
1760,10," Although Defendants argued below that Buccaneer could not prove an agreement or conspiracy to restrain trade, the district 
court found otherwise and Defendants do not challenge that determination here. We therefore assume the existence of an 
agreement and consider only whether that agreement restrained trade unreasonably. See Nw. Wholesale, 472 U.S. at 290 & n.4 
(assuming existence of § 1 agreement where defendant did not challenge lower court's finding of one)."
1760,11," To be sure, the terms Buccaneer uses to describe Defendants' actions—i.e., ""concerted refusal to deal"" and ""group boycott""—
are labels the courts long have attached to conduct meriting per se invalidation under § 1 in certain circumstances. See, e.g., 
Nw. Wholesale, 472 U.S. at 289 (""This Court has long held that certain concerted refusals to deal or group boycotts are so likely 
to restrict competition without any offsetting efficiency gains that they should be condemned as per se violations of § 1 of the 
Sherman Act.""). And Buccaneer's allegations—that Defendants conspired to deny Buccaneer reasonable access to the RM 
System and that the RM System is ""essential"" to Buccaneer's ability to compete—do track in part what Northwest Wholesale 
identified as the typical characteristics of forbidden group boycotts. See id. at 294 (explaining that the boycotts to which the 
Court has applied the per se rule ""often cut off access to a supply, facility, or market necessary to enable the boycotted firm to 
compete,"" among other things). But Buccaneer has failed to assert, let alone argue, that Defendants' conduct amounts to a per 
se violation of § 1. Cf. Orson, Inc. v. Miramax Film Corp., 79 F.3d 1358, 1367 n.9 (3d Cir. 1996) (""Although Orson contended in 
the district court that Miramax's relationship with the Ritz was illegal per se, and occasionally speaks of the relationship as a 
'boycott,' it does not contend in this appeal that the per se rule applies."" (emphasis added)). Not once is the term ""per se"" used in "
1761,," Buccaneer's opening or reply brief; and the single reference to ""per se"" in Buccaneer's summary judgment filings appears in an 
explanatory parenthetical appended to a case citation. And even if Buccaneer subjectively equated its group-boycott allegation to an allegation of per se illegality, we still would 
conclude that this oblique assertion does not suffice as the ""threshold case"" needed to justify application of the per se rule. See 
Nw. Wholesale, 472 U.S. at 298 (""A plaintiff seeking application of the per se rule must present a threshold case that the 
challenged activity falls into a category likely to have predominantly anticompetitive effects.""); see also Levine v. Cent. Fla. Med. 
Affiliates, Inc., 72 F.3d 1538, 1550 (11th Cir. 1996) (""[T]he attachment of the group boycott label does not necessarily require as 
a consequence an application of the per se approach."" (internal quotation marks omitted)). Although boycotts involving elements 
essential to competition may sometimes be per se illegal, the Supreme Court has clearly stated that application of the per se rule 
""must be based upon demonstrable economic effect rather than . . . upon formalistic line drawing."" See State Oil Co. v. Khan, 
522 U.S. 3, 14, 118 S. Ct. 275, 139 L. Ed. 2d 199 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted); cf. Levine, 72 F.3d at 1550 (""The 
labeling of a restraint as a group boycott does not eliminate the necessity of determining whether it is a naked restraint of trade 
with no purpose except stifling competition."" (internal quotation marks omitted)). Buccaneer has not attempted to make this 
threshold demonstration. Under these circumstances, we cannot conclude that application of the per se rule is warranted. See 
Nw. Wholesale, 472 U.S. at 298; cf. Law v. NCAA, 134 F.3d 1010, 1019 (10th Cir. 1998) (""[T]he Supreme Court has made it 
clear that the per se rule is a 'demanding' standard that should be applied only in clear cut cases.""). "
1762,12," We take issue with Defendants' characterization of Trinko as an essential facilities case. The Court merely acknowledged that 
the Second Circuit had relied on the doctrine in the underlying appeal and concluded that its decision ""would be unchanged 
even if we considered to be established law the 'essential facilities' doctrine crafted by some lower courts."" Id. at 410-11. The 
Court disclaimed ever having recognized the essential facilities doctrine and found ""no need either to recognize it or to repudiate 
it"" in that case. Id. at 411."
1762,13," Consistent with this conclusion, each of the five cases in which we have referenced Trinko involved § 2 claims alleging 
anticompetitive conduct by a single actor. See SOLIDFX, LLC v. Jeppesen Sanderson, Inc., 841 F.3d 827 (10th Cir. 2016); 
JetAway Aviation, LLC v. Bd. of Cty. Comm'rs, 754 F.3d 824 (10th Cir. 2014) (per curiam); Novell, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp., 731 
F.3d 1064 (10th Cir. 2013); Four Corners Nephrology Assocs., P.C. v. Mercy Med. Ctr. of Durango, 582 F.3d 1216 (10th Cir. 
2009); Christy Sports, LLC v. Deer Valley Resort Co., 555 F.3d 1188 (10th Cir. 2009)."
1762,14," Buccaneer also argues that the district court erroneously relied on Trinko, but we conclude that this reliance, if erroneous, is 
immaterial. To the extent the district court applied Trinko's ""right to refuse to deal"" rule, it did so in deeming lawful Defendants' 
alleged decision to exclude Buccaneer from the Bull Mountain Pipeline. But Defendants' actions toward Buccaneer vis-à-vis the 
Bull Mountain Pipeline are not at issue here. As Buccaneer concedes, its ""claims [a]re based on Defendant's [sic] refusal to 
allow Buccaneer reasonable access to the Ragged Mountain Gathering System."" Thus, exclusion from the RM System, not the 
Bull Mountain Pipeline, is the conduct that matters. And in addressing that conduct, the district court does not appear to have 
invoked Trinko. As a result, any alleged error by the district court in applying Trinko is inconsequential to Buccaneer's claims on 
appeal."
1762,15," For example, although the essential facilities doctrine is most often applied in the context of a claim under § 2, see generally 
3B Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law ¶¶ 770-74, at 195-295 (4th ed. 2015); 13 Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert 
Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law ¶ 2221c—d, at 407-11 (3d ed. 2012); see also, e.g., Pittsburg Cty., 358 F.3d at 721; Aspen 
Highlands Skiing Corp. v. Aspen Skiing Co., 738 F.2d 1509, 1519-21 (10th Cir. 1984), aff'd 472 U.S. 585, 105 S. Ct. 2847, 86 L. "
1763,," Ed. 2d 467 (1985), and although its elements are more consistent with § 2, see Pittsburg Cty., 358 F.3d at 721 (listing the first 
element as ""control of the essential facility by a monopolist"" (emphasis added)), we have stated that the doctrine originated 
under § 1, McKenzie v. Mercy Hosp., 854 F.2d 365, 369 (10th Cir. 1988), overruled in part on other grounds by Systemcare, Inc. 
v. Wang Lab. Corp., 117 F.3d 1137 (10th Cir. 1997), and on one occasion have applied it in the context of a § 1 claim, Gregory, 
448 F.3d at 1204."
1763,16," Although the Supreme Court traditionally has framed quick-look analysis as one of the several possible methods for applying 
the rule of reason, see, e.g., Cal. Dental Ass'n v. FTC, 526 U.S. 756, 770, 119 S. Ct. 1604, 143 L. Ed. 2d 935 (1999); see also 
Am. Needle, Inc. v. Nat'l Football League, 560 U.S. 183, 203, 130 S. Ct. 2201, 176 L. Ed. 2d 947 (2010) (stating that the rule of 
reason ""may not require a detailed analysis; it can sometimes be applied in the twinkling of an eye,"" which is language used 
synonymously with ""quick look"" (internal quotation marks omitted)), it occasionally has spoken of quick-look analysis and rule-of-
reason analysis as distinct concepts, see, e.g., FTC v. Actavis, Inc., 133 S. Ct. 2223, 2237, 186 L. Ed. 2d 343 (2013). While we "
1764,," are not convinced the latter instances signal a departure from the traditional framing, even if they do, it would not affect the 
outcome of our analysis here."
1764,17," Furthermore, we agree with our Sixth Circuit colleagues' reasoning in Worldwide Baseball & Sport Tours, Inc. v. NCAA, that 
quick-look analysis is generally unsuited for cases in which the relevant market is ""neither obvious nor undisputed."" 388 F.3d 
955, 961 (6th Cir. 2004); see also id. (""Far from being a case in which 'an observer with even a rudimentary understanding of 
economics could conclude that the arrangements in question would have an anticompetitive effect on consumers and markets,' 
[Cal. Dental Ass'n, 526 U.S. at 770] (emphasis added), here the relevant market is not readily apparent and the Plaintiffs have 
failed to adequately define a relevant market, thereby making it impossible to assess the effect of [the challenged practice] on 
customers rather than merely on competitors.""). As we explain below, this is precisely such a case. "
1770,18," Buccaneer contends, for example, that Defendants mischaracterize our precedent discussing the minimum market-share 
percentage necessary to establish market power and that, contrary to the district court's conclusion, there is a disputed issue of 
material fact as to whether Defendants were ""price takers"" in the market for downstream gas sales and for that reason lacked 
any ability to raise gas prices. Even if we agreed on both points, it would not change our conclusion that Buccaneer failed to 
carry its burden of coming forward with evidence from which a jury could find Defendants possessed market power in the gas-
sales market. "
1776,1," The underlying facts of this case were presented in detail in Lenox I and Lenox II. We reiterate here only the information 
needed to understand the issues raised in this appeal. "
1777,2," In light of this development, Defendants, which initially had asserted the complaints were made to MSD USA by the Japanese 
surgeons, changed their story and claimed instead that the complaints came from MSD Japan representatives and other third-
party witnesses. "
1778,3," Although the parties used the term ""res judicata"" in the Lenox II appeal and use it again in this appeal, we employ the more 
descriptive term ""claim preclusion"" in this opinion. See Migra v. Warren City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ., 465 U.S. 75, 77 n.1, 104 S. 
Ct. 892, 79 L. Ed. 2d 56 (1984); Wilkes v. Wyo. Dep't of Emp't Div. of Labor Standards, 314 F.3d 501, 504 n.1 (10th Cir. 2002). "
1781,4," ""Simply stated, federal courts have consistently applied Copperweld to preclude the finding of antitrust conspiracies within a 
corporate family . . . ."" Horst v. Laidlaw Waste Sys., Inc., 917 F. Supp. 739, 742 (D. Colo. 1996); see also 7 Phillip E. Areeda & 
Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law ¶ 1464f, at 225 & n.33 (3d ed. 2008) (stating that ""[t]he post-Copperweld decisions are 
virtually unani[m]ous"" on this point); 1 A.B.A. Section of Antitrust Law, Antitrust Law Developments 27 (5th ed. 2002) 
[hereinafter Antitrust Developments] (""Most courts have held that the Copperweld rule extends to conspiracies between sister 
corporations.""). "
1782,5," The district court here cited Growers 1-7 v. Ocean Spray Cranberries, Inc., No. 12-12016-RWZ, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 61654, 
2014 WL 1764533 (D. Mass. May 2, 2014), as having ""reject[ed] [the] argument that [the] First Circuit has extended Copperweld 
to monopoly cases."" To be sure, the Growers court rejected a party's characterization of a prior First Circuit case as having 
extended Copperweld to § 2 claims and clarified that the cited case did not address the issue. 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 61654, 
[WL] at *7 n.11. But the Growers court then decided for itself that Copperweld's reasoning does apply in the context of § 2. 2014 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 61654, [WL] at *7. "
1783,6," Although MSD Japan is actually a wholly owned subsidiary of MSD, Inc., and thus a sub-subsidiary or ""grandchild"" of 
Medtronic, Inc., Defendants have not argued that this distinction should affect our analysis. Cf. Horst, 917 F. Supp. at 742 
(""[W]hether Defendants are sister corporations or one is the wholly owned 'grandchild' of the other, they are [a single entity] 
incapable of conspiring under the Sherman Act.""). "
1785,7," In addition to the above-referenced district court cases, Defendants rely on the Eighth Circuit's decision in H.J., Inc. [**33]  v. 
International Telephone & Telegraph Corp. for the same basic propositions. See 867 F.2d 1531, 1549 (8th Cir. 1989) (""[The 
parent] cannot be held liable 'as an actor' without proof that it performed acts sufficient to create liability, or actively influenced 
[the subsidiary] in its violations. . . . Nor can [the parent] be held liable as the sole shareholder of [the subsidiary], since [the 
plaintiff] offered no evidence to show that [the subsidiary] was a mere instrumentality or alter ego of [the parent], or that [the 
subsidiary] is a sham corporation formed to shield [the parent] from liability.""). But the H.J., Inc. court never considered whether 
the parent and subsidiary defendants there could be considered a single enterprise under Copperweld, even for purposes of the 
plaintiff's § 1 claim. See id. at 1543-45 (overturning jury's finding of Sherman Act § 1 violation based on inadequacy of evidence 
showing parent and subsidiary conspired, without considering whether parent and subsidiary were incapable of conspiring for 
purposes of § 1)."
1785,8," In one footnote of its opening brief and twice in its reply brief, Lenox appears to express a different view of the legal theory 
applicable to its antitrust claims. In these instances, Lenox essentially contends that each defendant's liability under § 2 must be 
assessed individually, albeit under a modified conspiracy framework. This vacillation likely reflects Lenox's awareness that it is 
walking a fine line doctrinally in this case between establishing enterprise liability and avoiding privity with MSD USA for 
purposes of claim preclusion, which we address in Part III.B.1 below. Because Lenox has not adequately briefed this potential 
alternative legal theory, we reject it in favor of the principles outlined in this opinion."
1785,9," Lenox contends this ""role"" test was espoused by this court in Lenox II, such that, aside from being proper as an objective legal 
matter, it also constitutes the law of the case. See Entek GRB, LLC v. Stull Ranches, LLC, 840 F.3d 1239, 1241 (10th Cir. 2016) 
(when invoked, ""[l]aw of the case doctrine . . . preclud[es] the relitigation of issues either expressly or implicitly resolved in prior 
proceedings in the same court""). We reject this reading of Lenox II. In the relevant portion of that decision, we briefly addressed 
Defendants' implicit contention that MSD USA was solely responsible for the sham recall of Lenox's bone mill, observing that 
Defendants ""appear[] to assume . . . [they] had no role in the recall."" Lenox II, 762 F.3d at 1128. But since the district court had 
not yet permitted discovery on Defendants' involvement, we concluded Defendants could not ""salvage the summary judgment 
ruling based on [their] assumption that none of [them] played a role in the recall."" Id. Viewed in context, it is apparent that we 
used the word ""role"" as a generic descriptor and that we were not announcing any substantive legal test of enterprise liability. 
Lenox II established neither law nor law of the case on this issue. "
1786,10," Although the district court stated that ""Lenox does not dispute that it had a full and fair opportunity to litigate its claims in the 
prior arbitration,"" Lenox contends it did dispute this point below, and it continues to dispute it on appeal. Our review of the record 
convinces us that Lenox adequately preserved this issue in the district court. "
1787,11," Numerous other circuits have found privity between related corporations without a concomitant finding of alter-ego status or an 
otherwise controlling relationship. See, e.g., Rabo Agrifinance, Inc. v. Terra XXI, Ltd., 583 F.3d 348, 353 (5th Cir. 2009) (finding 
relationships among various entities involved in same large-scale farming enterprise ""sufficiently close to bind all of them . . . to 
the judgment in the [prior action],"" without describing nature of relationships); Anchor Glass Container Corp. v. Buschmeier, 426 "
1788,," F.3d 872, 879-80 (7th Cir. 2005) (finding privity between parent and previously sued subsidiary based on parent's ownership of 
subsidiary and fact that subsidiary's executives acted on behalf of or in interest of parent); In re Colonial Mortg. Bankers Corp., 
324 F.3d at 18-19; Mars Inc., 58 F.3d at 619; Lubrizol Corp. v. Exxon Corp., 929 F.2d 960, 966 (3d Cir. 1991); Cent. Transp., 
Inc. v. Four Phase Sys., Inc., 936 F.2d 256, 260 & n.2 (6th Cir. 1991) (finding privity between corporation named as a party in 
prior arbitration and two of its sister subsidiaries; and noting defendants' argument that entities had ""close affiliation, joint legal 
representation and identity of interests""); In re Teltronics Servs., Inc., 762 F.2d 185, 191-92 (2d Cir. 1985) (finding privity 
between various corporate entities involved in successive lawsuits, seemingly on the basis of common ownership alone). See 
also 18A Wright & Miller, supra, § 4460, at 639 (""Corporate parents and subsidiaries have been found in privity so as to enable 
one to assert claim preclusion against a plaintiff who had already [brought] an action against the other.""). In fact, several circuits have determined that where, as here, closely related defendants are sued by the same plaintiff and the 
subsequent defendant seeks to invoke claim preclusion based on the earlier judgment, traditional privity is not necessary. See, 
e.g., FleetBoston Fin. Corp. v. Alt, 638 F.3d 70, 80-81 (1st Cir. 2011) (""We, along with other circuits, have long held that claim 
preclusion applies if the new defendant is closely related to a defendant from the original action—who was not named in the 
previous law suit, not merely when the two defendants are in privity."" (quoting Airframe Sys., Inc. v. Raytheon Co., 601 F.3d 9, 
17 (1st Cir. 2010))); Midcontinent Broad. Co. v. Dresser Indus., Inc., 669 F.2d 564, 567 (8th Cir. 1982) (""[W]here, as here, the 
parties have such a close relationship, bordering on near identity, they are for purposes of res judicata the same parties.""); 
Gambocz v. Yelencsics, 468 F.2d 837, 840-41 (3d Cir. 1972). See also 47 Am. Jur. 2d Judgments § 577 (noting that ""[c]ourts 
have applied nonmutual res judicata where there existed a close or significant relationship between defendants in the first action 
and defendants in the second action who are asserting res judicata against the same plaintiff,"" and referring to this standard as 
""privity-like""). "
1789,12," Because it will not affect the outcome of this appeal, we give Lenox the benefit of the doubt and both (1) construe its brief as 
asserting that Defendants' involvement constitutes facts necessary to establish its § 2 claims, and (2) assume for the sake of 
argument that this assertion is correct. Lenox's discussion suggests, however, that its real complaint is not that its ignorance of 
Defendants' involvement deprived it of a fair opportunity to litigate its current claims in the prior proceeding, but that this lack of 
knowledge deprived it of a fair opportunity to litigate its current claims against Defendants in the prior proceeding. This focus 
misinterprets the nature of the preclusion inquiry once privity is established. What matters is whether Lenox had a full and fair 
opportunity to litigate its § 2 claims against MSD USA—if it did, then it is barred from later bringing those claims against MSD 
USA or any entity in privity with MSD USA. See Lowell Staats, 878 F.2d at 1277 (""If Smith is in privity with Nuclear, then res 
judicata bars claims against Smith which could have been raised in the [prior] litigation against Nuclear.""); Spence v. Latting, 512 
F.2d 93, 98 (10th Cir. 1975) (""Where a second suit between the same parties or their privies is on the same [transaction], the 
final judgment in the prior action is conclusive as to all matters which were actually litigated as well as those which could have 
been litigated."" (emphases added)). "
1790,13," The Seventh Circuit case Lenox relies on—Doe v. Allied-Signal, Inc.—does not provide otherwise. See 985 F.2d at 914-15 
(holding that first action for negligent failure to keep plaintiff safe from rape at workplace was distinct from subsequent action 
based on employer's misrepresentation of plaintiff's employment status because facts forming basis of second action arose from 
different transaction and damages asserted in second action did not accrue until first action ended). "
1791,14," Lenox initially filed an unopposed motion to seal Volume VIII of the Joint Appendix, which consists of thirteen documents filed 
under seal in the district court pursuant to a protective order. This court issued an order requesting additional justification to seal, 
and, in its response, Lenox abandoned its request to seal the documents. Responding to the same order, Defendants requested 
that only two of the thirteen documents remain sealed: a 2013 motion (JA 1481-1562) and an expert's declaration (JA 1460-80). 
Defendants asserted that these two documents contain sensitive business information of Defendants and third-parties. We have reviewed these documents and [**51]  agree. ""[HN10[
] A] party may overcome the presumption in favor of public 
access to judicial records by demonstrating the [portions of the record] contain sources of business information that might harm 
a litigant's competitive standing."" Deherrera v. Decker Truck Line, Inc., 820 F.3d 1147, 1162 n.8 (10th Cir. 2016) (internal 
quotation marks omitted). ""And the public's interest in access to judicial records is lessened when the contents are not used to 
determine the litigant's substantive legal rights."" Id. (alteration and internal quotation marks omitted). Because these two 
documents contain proprietary business information not only of Defendants but of non-parties, comprise a small portion of the 
overall record, and play no role in our resolution of this appeal, we grant the motion to seal as to these two documents. See id.; 
AST Sports Sci., Inc. v. CLF Distribution Ltd., 514 F.3d 1054, 1057 n.1 (10th Cir. 2008). "
1802,1," The fourteen Anthem service areas are California (Blue Cross license only), Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, 
Kentucky, Maine, Missouri (excluding thirty counties in western Missouri), Nevada, New Hampshire, New York (excluding certain 
areas), Ohio, Virginia (excluding certain counties near Washington, D.C.), and Wisconsin. PX 125. Throughout the trial, the 
parties have referred to these territories as the Anthem ""states,"" even though Anthem does not have an exclusive license for all 
fourteen states in their entirety, and the Court will use that designation in this opinion. "
1803,2," Plaintiffs also initially alleged that the merger would harm competition for the sale of individual insurance policies on the public 
exchanges, Compl. ¶¶ 51-63, but they subsequently dismissed that claim. See Stip. re Pls.' Allegations Concerning the Sale of 
Individual Insurance Policies on Public Exchanges [Dkt. 163]."
1803,3," The federal Affordable Care Act imposes penalties on large group employers that fail to meet certain minimum value and 
affordability requirements. 26 U.S.C. § 4980H(b)(1), (c)(3). "
1804,4," Employers may also purchase stop-loss insurance to cap their healthcare expenses at a particular level if they suffer any 
unusually large claims. See Abbott (WTW) Tr. 69; Archer (HealthSMART Benefit Solutions) Dep. 35-36. "
1809,5," The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, and other courts, have approved the use of the Horizontal Merger Guidelines as guidance in 
merger cases. See Heinz, 246 F.3d at 716 n.9; Fruehauf Corp. v. FTC, 603 F.2d 345, 353-54 (2d Cir. 1979); H & R Block, 833 F. 
Supp. 2d at 52 n.10. "
1812,6," Dr. Dranove calculated the critical elasticity in the market based on data obtained from the insurers, and that exercise led to the 
conclusion that 6% of national accounts would drop their coverage if the price went up 5%. Dranove Tr. 864. But studies of the 
industry revealed that the marketplace is actually much less responsive, and that insurers do not eliminate this important 
employee benefit even if the price goes up. Dranove Tr. 865."
1812,7," While Anthem argued there is no economic basis for combining ASO and fully-insured plants into a single product market for 
national accounts, Anthem Pretrial Br. at 5-6, Dr. Fowdur did not take issue with this particular aspect of Dr. Dranove's 
hypothetical market. ""I think the source of the confusion is not between ASO and fully insured. I think the source of the confusion 
stems from the fact that plaintiffs have arbitrarily established this bright-line threshold at 5000 plus enrollees."" Fowdur Tr. 1303. "
1813,8," Dr. Fowdur steadfastly resisted offering her own opinion as to what number would have been the correct one to choose, 
confining her opinion to what was wrong with plaintiffs' selection of 5000 as a place to draw the line. Fowdur Tr. 1364-65. "
1814,9," Indeed, the evidence showed that there could be some national accounts of 5000 employees or more that do not require highly 
individualized plans, or are sufficiently concentrated that regional plans may satisfy their network needs. But products sold to 
those employers were included in the market even if doing so overstated their significance to the group as a whole. "
1816,10," There is evidence that healthcare providers in the fourteen Anthem states draw some patients from outside the fourteen 
states. See Wilhelmsen (SNHHS) Dep. 77, 176 (approximately 5% of patients at the Southern New Hampshire Health System's 
Nashua hospital came from Massachusetts and its service area includes four Massachusetts towns). But the relevant question is 
not how patients (employees) would respond to a SSNIP in the market for national accounts health insurance but how the 
employers that are the customers — would. See, e.g., Penn State Hershey Med. Ctr., 838 F.3d at 338-46 (holding that basing 
geographic market on patient flow data in a hospital merger case ""failed to properly account for the likely response of insurers in 
the face of a SSNIP""). Dr. Fowdur frequently blurred this distinction. Fowdur Tr. 4215-16. "
1817,11," None of this is inconsistent with Dr. Fowdur's conclusion, based on Dr. Dranove's data, that 60% of the 126 Anthem national 
accounts she reviewed were sliced. Fowdur Tr. 1347. "
1818,12," Ultimately, Dr. Fowdur's theory that reducing the number of employees to 3000 or 1000, or disaggregating the states, would 
radically alter the picture and reveal the strength of numerous smaller market participants, was not borne out by the evidence 
introduced in Phase II. Since the allegations in the second phase of the trial concerned all large group employers, the market 
share data that was introduced related to employers with as few as 50 or 100 employees, and tightly drawn geographic regions. 
Yet the dominance of the four national carriers, and therefore, the level of market concentration that would exist in the wake of a 
merger of two of them remained striking in the majority of plaintiffs' thirty-five sample markets. See PDX 28; PX 751; Dranove Tr. 
3719-23."
1818,13," For example, a market with four firms having market shares of 45%, 30%, 18% and 7% has an HHI of 3298 (452 + 302 + 182 + 
72). If the firms with 18% and 7% market shares were to merge, the new HHI would be 3550 (452 + 302 + 252), so the HHI would 
increase by 252 points (3550 - 3298). See Heinz, 246 F.3d at 716 n.9. "
1819,14," Dr. Dranove made an exception for Blue Shield of California, which competes against Anthem in California under a separate 
Blue Shield license, and is therefore treated as a distinct competitor from Anthem in calculating market shares. Dranove Tr. 883-
84. "
1820,15," Dr. Dranove also calculated market shares and the HHI with looking at Anthem's share alone, without combining it with any 
host lives covered by the other Blues. He testified that ""the merger would still put the market concentration above the 
presumptive threshold [and] . . . the [change in] HHI would also still be above the presumptive thresholds."" Dranove Tr. 1169. "
1822,16," While plenty of industry witnesses agreed that TPA's exist, none supplied evidence of anything other than anecdotal evidence 
of their connection to a handful of national accounts. Thus, they appeared to be ""significant"" competitors in this market only to 
defendants' economists."
1822,17," Dr. Willig also testified that Dr. Dranove's census method is improper because the census number was lower than the buildup 
number in five out of six of Dr. Dranove's calculations, which suggests that census-based denominators understated the total 
market size. Willig Tr. 2219; see also Fowdur Tr. 1330-31. But if even both sets of data were imperfect, the fact that they 
mirrored each other is important. "
1826,18," Dr. Dranove testified that each company tracks when it wins or loses business and who the incumbent is when it bids for 
business, but they do not track when they were the top two bidders for an account. Dranove Tr. 2281-82, 2285. To approximate 
that information, Dr. Dranove narrowed the competitive situations he analyzed to those situations where Anthem was the 
incumbent and a customer switched away to Cigna and vice versa. Id. at 2281-82. He reasoned that if Anthem or Cigna ""bid and 
lost and they were the incumbent, they were more likely to be second and third than they were to be fourth and fifth"" since 
ordinarily, ""the incumbent doesn't lose because it's not well-liked"" but ""because somebody jumped over them."" Id. at 2285. "
1827,19," This analysis does not take into account the fact that even with its discount advantage, Anthem has been forced to fend off 
Cigna not by lowering its ASO fees, but by offering trend guarantees or making other concessions. See, e.g., Kertesz (Anthem) 
Tr. 575-76. "
1828,20," In the Court's view, neither economic model provides a perfect analogy. Dr. Dranove's criticism that customers would not have 
the level of information assumed in Dr. Israel's model has some force; notwithstanding the evidence that customers were aided 
by brokers who gather considerable intelligence concerning discounts and other factors, the notion that customers would be 
certain of a carrier's bottom line was not established by the evidence. But there was testimony from brokers in Phase II to 
support Dr. Israel's supposition that at least in some instances, the customer may initiate another round of negotiation after the 
final two bids have been submitted and ranked. See, e.g., Hawthorne (Scott Insurance) Tr. 2992-93."
1828,21," The Phase II evidence told similar story. The Vice President and General Manager of California large group business exhorted 
her sales team to go after Cigna (""Wanted — Dead or Alive!"") at both the 2015 and 2016 Annual sales and management 
workshops, as Cigna was identified as a top competitor and Cigna's level funded plan posed a ""new competitive threat."" PX 548, 
PX 737; Rothermel (Anthem) Tr. 4123-28. "
1829,22," Because the Court is enjoining the merger on the basis of the national accounts market in the fourteen Anthem states, it does 
not need to consider and its decision does not turn on a finding related to the national accounts market for the entire United 
States. The Court notes that while it does credit the testimony of Anthem representatives that they look forward to competing 
under the Cigna brand without needing to obtain a cede, see Kertesz (Anthem) Tr. 656 (it would be ""exhilarating"" to be an 
national plan that operates in fifty states); see also DeVeydt (Anthem) Tr. 1689, 1735-36; Mathai (Anthem) Tr. 1259, there is no 
question that merger will also eliminate some head-to-head competition in the thirty-six non-Anthem states as Anthem has 
historically sought cedes to sell to prospective customers headquartered there. Dranove Tr. 992-93; PX 136 (discussing a 
potential cede); PX 56 (showing Anthem sought permission of Blue licensee to bid on account in non-Anthem state); PX 135 
(showing Anthem sought the permission of Blue licensee in non-Anthem states to compete against Cigna). It was also 
established that there are important aspects of Blue Cross Blue Shield Association membership — in particular, the mutuality 
and cooperation involved in the cedes, the potential for Blue Card revenue, and the best efforts rules — that redound to the 
benefit of the Association as a whole, and that these give rise to an inherent conflict of interest that could affect Cigna's 
competitive conduct in the 36 states. "
1831,23," This chart was presented during Phase 2 of the trial, which addressed competition in the market for the sale of health 
insurance to large groups. A large group customer was defined based on the applicable state regulation for large group 
insurance: employers with 50 or more employees or 100 or more employees including those with 5000 or more employees. See 
Dranove Tr. 4689-90. Accordingly, while Dr. Willig's chart concerns entry into a broader market, that market includes national 
accounts. "
1832,24, Anthem has approximately 550 national accounts. Mathai (Anthem) Tr. 1257. 
1834,25," Aetna defines national accounts to mean 3000 employees or more, Hayes (Aetna) Dep. 221-22, so this estimate would be 
even smaller using a definition of 5000 employees or more. "
1835,26," United does not rent its network to TPAs. Schumacher (United) Dep. 164, 265."
1835,27," So while the defendants emphasized the fact that Starbucks went onto an exchange, Kertesz (Anthem) Tr. 634, it turned out to 
be Aenta's exchange. Hayes (Aetna) Dep. 238. "
1837,28," The likelihood of greater risk of collusion or coordination is also a basis upon which a court may prohibit a merger. See PPG 
Indus., 798 F.2d at 1503. Plaintiffs presented evidence about Blue licensees discussing ""strategy"" within the BCBSA and 
allegedly exchanging competitive intelligence, arguing that coordination between Cigna and non-Anthem Blues is a ""likely"" 
anticompetitive effect. See PX 145; Pls.' Proposed Findings of Fact: Phase I ¶ 196. But plaintiffs accord too much significance to 
references in Anthem's files to our ""Blue brethren"" or ""comrades in arms,"" Kertesz (Anthem Dep. 206); Pogany (Anthem) Dep. 
122, and certain discussions of ""strategy"" within the Association. Swedish (Anthem) Tr. 269-70. Defense expert Dr. Israel 
testified that the health insurance industry is not conducive to coordination because of confidential bidding, powerful buyers, 
highly differentiated products, and many different firms with different footprints and different offerings. Israel Tr. 1986. And 
plaintiffs' own expert Dr. Dranove found no evidence of collusion, price-fixing, or bid-rigging among any competitors in the 
healthcare industry, including by Anthem and the other Blues licensees. Dranove Tr. 1018-21. Therefore, the Court is not 
predicating its decision on a finding that plaintiffs have meet their burden to prove that the merger results in a greater risk of 
collusion or coordination. "
1838,29," The calculation was based on claims experience that both companies had in common and was not limited to use of claims 
from providers who participated in both networks. While the majority of the providers overlapped, there were some Anthem 
providers who were not part of the Cigna network. In those cases, the difference between the Anthem price and the Cigna out-
of-network price would have been even more significant. See Drozdowski Tr. 1652. "
1839,30," According to Matheis, initially Anthem ""just assumed, whole cloth, [it] would turn on the affiliate language, regardless of the net 
effective value."" Matheis Tr. 1489-90. But with Cigna's input, it refined the calculation to include a value for where Cigna had the 
better rates. Id."
1839,31," To put that figure in context, Dr. Israel also said that while medical costs are 95% of the employer's total healthcare spend, the 
discount differential is actually an extremely small percent of that expenditure — less than 1%. Israel Tr. 4417, 4420-21 ($2.4 
billion is less than 1% of medical spending in the fourteen states)."
1839,32," Beyond pointing to ""basic economics,"" Dr. Israel did not detail how the merged company would actually be able to improve 
upon the current Anthem volume-based discounts. He stated, ""I certainly don't think that the reduction in Anthem pricing comes 
from Anthem pushing its current provider rates below where they are today . . . . ,"" Israel Tr. 1835, and one of Anthem's other 
experts, Dr. Willig, also testified that Anthem has already achieved the benefits of scale in its dealings with providers, and that 
increased volume would not enable it to obtain greater discounts. Willig Tr. 2230-31 (""Anthem's already past the threshold of 
having enough size to do what it needs to do in terms of offering volume to providers.""). This is consistent with the testimony of 
the Anthem CEO, Joe Swedish, who insisted that the merger would not result in the new company's paying less to all providers 
— ""certainly not less than what we are paying now as Anthem."" Swedish Tr. 294; see also [**158]  id. at 290 (""Q: [I]f this merger 
goes through, your plan is to use the merger to get even bigger discounts, right? A: I don't think that's the plan.""). In the end, Dr. "
1840,," Israel's calculation of savings for Anthem customers is based solely on the limited number of instances in which Cigna's rate is 
lower, and according to him, those savings amount to a reduction of substantially less than 1% of Anthem customers' provider 
costs. Israel Tr. 1835. And the record is devoid of any evidence explaining what steps would actually be taken to enable Anthem 
customers to avail themselves of those Cigna rates. "
1841,33," The Supreme Court stated in FTC v. Procter & Gamble Co., 386 U.S. 568, 579, 87 S. Ct. 1224, 18 L. Ed. 2d 303 (1967), that 
""[p]ossible economies cannot be used as a defense to illegality"" in Section 7 merger cases, and as the court observed in Staples 
I, 970 F. Supp. at 1088-89, this statement has prompted some courts and commentators to question whether economic 
efficiencies will ultimately be found to be a viable legal defense."
1841,34," In a somewhat misleading citation, Anthem points to this general statement in Arch Coal, but asserts: ""[t]o be cognizable, 
merger efficiencies need only be 'merger-specific' and 'verifiable by reasonable means.'"" Anthem COL ¶ 64 (emphasis added)."
1841,35," In the merger of coal companies in Arch Coal, the court declined to recognize the claimed savings that would have resulted 
from actions the companies could have taken alone on the grounds that they were not merger-specific. 329 F. Supp. 2d at 151-
52. Savings related to inventory reduction, the need for fewer haul trucks, and the anticipated elimination of equipment were 
found to lack evidentiary support. Id. at 152-53. In short, while the court agreed that some efficiencies would result from the "
1842,," combined operation of adjacent mines, it concluded that most of the purported savings had ""been called into question as either 
non-existent or overstated"" and that therefore, the efficiencies defense was not sufficient alone to overcome the evidence of 
anticompetitive effects. Id. at 153. The court did state that the fact that Arch would ""achieve some measure of lower costs and 
higher productivity"" was relevant to an assessment of the post-merger market, and that those efficiencies ""provide[d] some 
limited additional evidence to rebut the claim of post-merger anticompetitive effects"" even though they had not been quantified. 
Id. Ultimately, though, the court concluded on other grounds, including the relative weakness of the acquired company, that 
defendants had rebutted the presumption that the merger would substantially lessen competition."
1842,36," Anthem directs the Court to a statement in the recent Aetna opinion that efficiencies must be shown to benefit the consumer. 
See Anthem's Supp. Conclusions of Law [Dkt. 495] ¶ 1, quoting Aetna, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8490, 2017 WL 325189, at *70, 
which quotes Sysco, 113 F. Supp. 3d at 82. It is true that this language in both the Aetna and Sysco opinions means that any 
claimed savings must inure to the benefit of the customer in order to qualify [**165]  as an efficiency, but neither court altered the 
test in the Guidelines to single out pass through as the defining touchstone of an efficiency. So even if the savings and the pass 
through could be verified — and both are questionable — the entire theory fails because the medical cost savings are not 
merger-specific."
1842,37," See Israel Tr. 4406-10 (""[T]he real bottom line difference between the two simulations is whether you include the medical cost 
savings or you don't . . . . The single most important thing is medical cost savings."")."
1842,38," See also Israel Tr. 4372 (""[L]ower costs are a result of the merger."") (emphasis added)."
1842,39," Counsel for Anthem argued at the close of the case that this is no longer the governing standard because the Heinz court 
lifted it from a version of the Horizontal Merger Guidelines that was subsequently modified. Curran (Def. Counsel) Tr. 4900. 
(""DOJ and the FTC said they have learned from their experience and that they are, therefore, modifying their standards.""). But 
while Heinz cited the 1992 Guidelines for the proposition that efficiencies must be merger-specific, it cited a leading antitrust 
treatise for its explanation of what that means. See 246 F. 3d at 722, citing 4A Phillip E. Areeda, Herbert Hovenkamp & John L. 
Solow, Antitrust Law, ¶ 973 (1998). No court has revised the legal test in the wake of the 2010 revision to the Guidelines. H & 
R Block, cited by Anthem, still used it in 2011, see 833 F. Supp. 2d at 52, and Sysco also relied upon by Anthem, set forth the "
1843,," same test in 2015. 113 F. Supp. 3d at 81-82. Indeed, it is not at all clear what counsel was referring to when he told the Court 
that this particular aspect of the Guidelines had been changed; in Cardinal Health, 12 F. Supp. 2d at 60, the court quoted the 
requirement in the 1992 Guidelines that a cognizable efficiency must be ""unlikely to be accomplished in the absence of . . . the 
proposed merger"" which is identical to the language that appears in the 2010 Guidelines, and is the very standard that Anthem 
urged the Court to apply. Curran Tr. 4900-01. Therefore, the admonition in Cardinal Health that ""[i]n light of the anti-competitive 
concerns that mergers raise, efficiencies, no matter how great, should not be considered if they could also be accomplished 
without a merger,"" 12 F. Supp. 2d at 60, still pertains today. "
1844,40," When Dr. Israel acknowledged that he was not even taking the affiliate clauses into account, Israel Tr. 4383, he revealed his 
analysis to be largely abstract and diminished its relevance to the actual business circumstances at hand."
1844,41," A failure to comply with the best efforts rule could result in Anthem's loss of its license to do business under the Blue Cross 
and Blue Shield brands, and the company would face the sanction of a fee of close to $3 billion to fund the establishment of a 
replacement Blue plan in its exclusive service area. PX 704, PX 125; Schlegel Tr. 1423-24. CEO Joe Swedish specifically 
testified that given the importance of the Blue brand to Anthem's business, Anthem has every intention of complying. Swedish 
Tr. 223. So there is no evidentiary basis for Dr. Willig's speculation that the best efforts rules do not constitute a credible threat 
that would influence Anthem's behavior. See Willig Tr. 2160."
1844,42," This is another area in which the expert's economic model diverges from the reality of the business circumstances. Dr. Israel 
testified, ""[i]n my analysis, it's not really a rebranding . . . it's the combination of the volumes from the two firms."" Israel Tr. 1847. 
But this is not an academic exercise, and the fact of the rebranding makes a difference to the legal analysis. Dr. Israel also 
opined, ""[i]f you think about [it] from the point of view of the Cigna network, there are going to be some providers where Cigna 
just has more volume today, the better cost position . . . , my analysis would say, those are going to stay Cigna, the Cigna 
contract is going to be what it's built from."" Israel Tr. 4382. But the actual requirements of the Blues' best efforts rules militate 
against sustaining or building upon the Cigna business within the 14 states, so this aspect of the analysis is not supported by the 
facts. See PX 79 (detailing the ways in which the national best efforts requirement ""restricts growth post compliance;"" ""NewCo 
must manage total revenue growth to not outpace Blue revenue growth""). "
1845,43," Schlegel testified that the Anthem synergy estimates include not only those employees of rebranded Cigna customers 
headquartered within the Anthem states who live within the 14 states, but also the employees who live elsewhere. Schlegel 
(Anthem) Tr. 1414. He explained that rebranding those lives would be automatic if a customer insured all of its employees 
nationwide under a single contract and did not slice out other geographic regions. Id. at 1436-37."
1845,44," Schlegel did note that the more successful Anthem turns out to be at growing its Blue-branded Medicare Advantage business, 
or selling Cigna specialty products to its Blue customers, the less it would need to rely on rebranding. Schlegel (Anthem) Tr. 
1416-17."
1845,45," Thus, the situation can be distinguished from the bulk discount referenced in the Guidelines. See Guidelines §12 (""A merger 
that does not enhance market power on the buying side of the market can nevertheless lead to a reduction in prices paid by the 
merged firm, for example, by reducing transactions costs or allowing the merged firm to take advantage of volume-based 
discounts. Reduction in prices paid by the merging firms not arising from the enhancement of market power can be significant in 
the evaluation of efficiencies from a merger, as discussed in Section 10.""). There is no evidence of any reduced transaction "
1846,," costs for the providers — it costs what it costs to treat a patient, Berfiend (IU Health) Tr. 2873 — and the defense calculation 
does not depend upon the negotiation of new rates based on the carriers' combined volume or bulk purchasing. No provider 
testified that it would be appreciably cheaper to deal with one carrier instead of two; they stated that there would be no difference 
at all. See Brendt (Sutter Health Plus) Dep. 120; Hurst (Piedmont) Dep. 47-48; Atwood (Stanford Health) Dep. 25-26. "
1847,46," Despite the fact that he was testifying as the defense expert, Dr. Israel was subjected to a not particularly friendly cross 
examination conducted by counsel for Cigna. Israel Tr. 2068-69 (""In this case, . . . you've been retained and are being paid 
exclusively by Anthem; is that correct? . . . And Cigna did not participate in the preparation of your report or your trial 
testimony?""). This unusual exercise underscored that the expert's analysis of Anthem's cost advantage was based strictly on 
Anthem's fee schedules and that it did not take into account any savings generated by the reductions in utilization that result 
from Cigna's collaborative approach. Rule (Cigna counsel) Tr. 2082-83 (""[W]ouldn't you say that in order to compare utilization, 
you have to adjust it for the different risks and features of the population that is being compared as Anthem versus Cigna at a 
particular provider?""); see also id. 2086 (""You can't determine whether Anthem programs versus the Cigna programs were more 
successful in lowering utilization, can you?""). "
1848,47," Based on his many years of merger and acquisition experience working on ""hundreds"" of transactions at [TEXT REDACTED 
BY THE COURT] explained that ""when you've got two really significant organizations looking to come together, it's hard work to 
sort out all of the efforts around integration and alignment and ownership and governance and process. And so that's 
challenging."" [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] Dep. 275. He predicted that the Anthem/Cigna transaction will be 
complicated by Anthem's membership in the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association: ""you've got . . . somebody that is a Blues 
licensee and they participate in a subset of the states and you marry that with a company that's trying to serve a broader set of 
states . . . . How do you sort that out? What are the rules of being a Blues licensee . . . ? . . . [H]ow are the economics going to 
work?"" Id. at 276-77. He added: ""[I]t's hard work. And it takes time to bring together companies, to bring together cultures, to 
bring together people, to bring together management structures, to bring together governance structures. And then that doesn't 
say anything about the technology that underlies both businesses and how you bring those together, the data structures . . . and 
then you get into the relationships that exist in the market and how do you draw those together, whether it's with brokers or 
consultants or with care providers or with lab companies or medical device manufacturers or pharmacies . . . there's a lot."" Id. at 
277-78."
1848,48," The PowerPoint presentation prepared for the July 11, 2016 Anthem Board meeting contains such dour pronouncements as: 
""Day 1 scope minimized due to delayed engagement model; 40% of minimized scope completed; remainder needs strong 
collaboration NOW."" ""Talent selection process not allowed to proceed."" ""Culture work stalled — Leadership team beginning with 
(L2) not named."" ""Focus limited to only High Level G&A; full scope G&A targets and plans limited to Anthem without full risk 
mitigation plan."" DX 712. "
1849,49," While Anthem's Schlegel described rebranding as ""the opportunity to have a Blue-branded Cigna product,"" and he made the 
claim that Cigna customers would ""enjoy the exact same benefits and services they're getting"" today, he acknowledged that the 
customers would lose the Cigna provider network and cost structure, and that ""you would have to meld some of that together . . . 
utilizing our contracts and utilizing our licenses."" Schlegel (Anthem) Tr. 1430. "
1850,50," This approach includes engaging with individual members so that they can become more actively aware of how their behavior 
and lifestyle can affect their health, and offering diagnostic screenings for free to an employer's entire workforce, as well as 
collaborating on the provider side of the relationship. Cordani explained that such an accountable care arrangement can include 
placing nurses in doctors' offices so that medical professionals can spend the necessary time with patients explaining their 
diagnoses and how to manage them, or notifying doctors when their patients are not refilling their prescriptions on schedule and 
are therefore at greater risk of experiencing complications. Cordani (Cigna) Tr. 393-97, 442-43 (reducing emergency room visits 
for asthma patients by ensuring they use controller therapies). Rachel Rowe of Granite Health testified that since 2012, her 
hospital consortium has had an ACO value-based overlay contract with Cigna aimed at population health. The collaboration 
involves care coordination and the sharing of raw patient data which can be analyzed to identify opportunities to reduce 
unexplained variations in medical practice. Cigna and Granite Health worked together to develop the shared services model and 
identify the particular metrics that would make the biggest difference in how patients are treated. Cigna pays a per-patient per-
month care coordination fee separate and apart for any fees charged for specific services, and it funds a pool that the provider 
may share if it achieves its medical cost and quality goals. Rowe (Granite Health) Tr. 2807-15."
1850,51," There was certainly evidence adduced to show that Anthem is also very involved in the health insurance industry's transition 
from a pure fee-for-service model to a more value-based approach, and that its numbers of value based or ACO arrangements 
are growing. See, e.g., Swedish (Anthem) Tr. 295-98; Drozdowski (Anthem) Tr. 1638; Dranove Tr. 975-77; Kehaly (Anthem) 
Dep. 113-16, 118-22. But the testimony revealed that at this time, that effort consists largely of incorporating incentive provisions 
in contracts with healthcare providers that enable the providers to earn financial rewards or kickers when their invoices fall below 
pre-established targets. See, e.g., Berfiend (IU Health) Tr. 2875-76. This can be a mixed blessing when Anthem insists upon 
contracts that ""rebase,"" and last year's successes thereby become next year's targets. Berfiend Tr. 2876. The providers who 
testified in the second phase of the trial also described a very different attitude on the part of Anthem towards the data sharing 
necessary for collaborative care as well as a lack of meaningful consultation in establishing the operative medical cost and 
quality goals. Compared to Cigna's individually negotiated model, Anthem's value based program was depicted as more of a 
take it or leave it option. Berfiend (IU Health) Tr. 2877-89; see also Hurst (Piedmont) Dep. 39-41 (Cigna is the most collaborative 
of the commercial payers in terms of setting quality based targets). "
1851,52," Ken Goulet, the former Anthem President of Commercial and Specialty Business, also predicted that Cigna provider discounts 
would deteriorate over time for any customers who chose to remain with the Cigna brand due to the migration of volume away 
from those providers. Goulet (Anthem) Dep. 138. "
1852,53," Certainly, access to a network that offers the customer's desired attributes is something that insurers are selling. But that 
""product"" — the network access, combined with the claims administration — is factored into and paid for by the ASO fees; the 
fees paid to the providers are not part of the insurers' ""costs"" that get factored into their ""product,"" i.e., the medical coverage. 
They are simply part of the customers' costs — their total healthcare spend."
1852,54," The Staples court also objected to the fact that the parties had included in their calculation price reductions that they would 
have received from suppliers separately and therefore, were not merger-specific. Staples I, 970 F. Supp. at 1090. "
1853,55," See Knevelbaard Dairies v. Kraft Foods, Inc., 232 F.3d 979, 985 (9th Cir. 2000). "
1854,56," Even in Kartell v. Blue Shield of Mass., Inc., 749 F.2d 922 (1st Cir. 1984), where a court declined to strike down an insurer's 
restrictions on provider billing practices, in part because it expressed the view that antitrust law is aimed at high prices, not low 
ones, one circumstance found to ""militate strongly . . . against any effort by an antitrust court to supervise the Blue 
Shield/physician price bargain"" was that the cost of medical care ""is an area of great complexity where more than solely 
economic values are at stake."" 749 F.2d at 930-31."
1854,57," See also Israel Tr. 4413 (the implication of the economic model is that ""bigger players get better prices.""). Here there can be 
no argument that when the expert talks about ""bigger,"" he means greater market share: he was talking about the ability to deliver 
more patient volume to providers, and increased patient volume is exactly the same thing as increased market share since the 
denominator of the market share fraction is the number of insured lives. The total number of patients to be covered in the 
marketplace is fixed, and there will not be increased demand. "
1855,58," The defense also argues that combining both fully-insured and ASO plans in the product market is invalid. See Defs.' Pretrial 
Brief at 6; Israel Tr. 4444. As set forth below, however, plaintiffs presented market share and concentration calculations for 
Anthem and ASO business separately. "
1856,59," Furthermore, Dr. Fowdur did not even attempt to present evidence that enough people would brave the traffic between 
Richmond and Washington, DC to make northern Virginia providers a real part of the competitive picture, and the providers she 
mentioned in Lynchburg and the Tidewater area are also too far to the east or the west of Richmond's central location to make a 
difference either."
1856,60," To confirm his conclusion, he utilized a critical elasticity approach and calculated the critical elasticity to be 1.18, which means 
that a 5% price increase by a hypothetical monopolist would become unprofitable if it resulted the loss of 6% of its business or 
more. Dranove Tr. 3695-97. Relying on the same academic literature he used in his analysis of national accounts, Dr. Dranove 
found that employers do not drop their coverage, and the estimated actual elasticity is much lower than the critical elasticity — 
""implying, as our intuition would tell us, that in response to a 5 percent increase in insurance premiums, these employers are not 
going to stop purchasing insurance."" Dranove Tr. 3697. "
1857,61," The Court notes that in the ordinary course of business, Anthem calculates market share similarly to the census approach. 
See PX 567 (calculating state commercial market share by dividing group membership resident in the state by the census's 
estimate of the number of individuals insured on an employer sponsored basis in the state)."
1857,62," The defense also criticizes the numbers because Dr. Dranove's build-up approach did not include other carriers or any TPAs 
and because he combined the market shares of the other Blues for some of the calculations. But the Court rejects these 
arguments for the same reasons it gave when they were made with respect to the national accounts claim. See section I.B. 
above. "
1858,63," King tried to dull the impact of the expert testimony and described the tracking of market share to be ""an inexact science."" King 
Tr. 3014. Other Anthem witnesses went further but did not advance the cause when they professed — somewhat incredibly and 
contrary to their ordinary course records — that they do not pay much attention to market shares at all. Rothermel (Anthem) Tr. 
4111-14; Guertin (Anthem) Tr. 3486-87. "
1865,1," Plaintiffs are Christopher Nelson, Dennis Crawford, Joshuah Enders, David Schechner, Chadwick Hauff, James Hagey, 
Nikolas Manak, John Smith, and Dudley Lane Dortch IV. "
1866,2," Although Plaintiffs have amended their complaints multiple times, Seagate's present motion is the first motion to dismiss in this 
litigation."
1866,3," This Order uses the terms ""drives,"" ""hard drives,"" or ""Barracuda drives"" interchangeably to refer to the various Seagate 
products discussed above consisting of or containing model number ST3000DM001 hard drives."
1866,4," A tenth named plaintiff voluntarily dismissed his claims. See dkts. 66, 67. "
1868,5," To the extent that Plaintiffs' conclusory assertion that the refurbished drives provided as replacements were ""highly likely to fail 
again,"" see SCAC ¶ 341, could be construed suggesting that replacement drives were not ""functionally identical"" to retail drives, 
that assertion is not supported by sufficient factual allegations to survive scrutiny under Iqbal and Twombly. The Court also notes 
that Seagate's warranty expressly permits it to ""replace [a returned] product with with a product that was previously used, 
repaired and tested to meet Seagate specifications."" Id. Ex. F at 1. Plaintiffs do not plausibly allege that Seagate failed to repair 
and test refurbished drives as required by the warranty."
1868,6," The Second Consolidated Amended Complaint also alleges that Seagate refused a second request for replacement by former 
plaintiff Adam Ginsberg, whose first replacement drive may have failed within the warranty period. See SCAC ¶¶ 203-10. "
1869,," Ginsberg voluntarily dismissed his claims after the filing of the operative complaint. See dkts. 66, 67. This Order therefore does 
not consider allegations regarding Ginsberg's experience."
1869,7," One case cited by Plaintiffs appears to have held that multiple attempts to have products repaired can be aggregated among 
several plaintiffs to establish a breach of warranty under the essential purpose doctrine. See Horvath v. LG Elecs. Mobilecomm 
U.S.A., Inc., No. 3:11-CV-01576-H-RBB, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19215, 2012 WL 2861160, at *1, *6 (S.D. Cal. Feb. 13, 2012) 
(allowing an essential purpose claim to proceed based on allegations that ""Plaintiffs collectively made at least ten repair "
1870,," attempts""). This Court respectfully disagrees with the aggregate analysis of Horvath, and declines to hold that a limited warranty 
remedy fails at its essential purpose absent a showing that a particular plaintiff was unable to obtain a satisfactory product 
despite giving a defendant a reasonable number of opportunities to remedy the defect. "
1871,8," See Roberts v. Electrolux Home Products, Inc., CV12-1644, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 185488, 2013 WL 7753579, at *10 (C.D. 
Cal. March 4, 2013); In re Toyota Motor Corp. Unintended Acceleration Mktg., Sales Practices, & Prods. Liab. Litig., 754 F. 
Supp. 2d 1145, 1185 (C.D. Cal. 2010); In re Sony Vaio Computer Notebook Trackpad Litig., No. 09CV2109 BEN RBB, 2010 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 115142, 2010 WL 4262191, at *3 (S.D. Cal. Oct. 28, 2010); Cartwright v. Viking Indus., Inc., 249 F.R.D. 351, 
356 (E.D. Cal. 2008); see also Huntzinger v. Aqua Lung Am., Inc., No. 15CV1146 WQH (KSC), 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 167140, 
2015 WL 8664284, at *9-10 (S.D. Cal. Dec. 10, 2015) (generally acknowledging the third party beneficiary doctrine to be 
applicable to implied warranty product defect claims, but holding that the plaintiff had not sufficiently alleged a contractual 
relationship between the manufacturer and retailer). "
1872,9," Seagate argues that Plaintiffs' false or misleading advertising claims under the consumer protection statutes of the eight other 
states fail for the same reasons. Plaintiffs note that Seagate does not specifically address Plaintiffs' other claims in its motion, "
1873,," but do not identify any differences in state law that would allow a claim to proceed in the absence of an adequately alleged 
affirmative misrepresentation or fraudulent omission. The Court assumes for the purpose of the present Order that the other 
consumer protection statutes at issue are not materially different from the California statutes."
1873,10, The Court takes judicial notice of the Backblaze report as incorporated by reference by the complaint. 
1877,11," Certain of these statements include more specific factual claims that might go beyond puffery, such as the assertion that 
Seagate drives can be used for automatic backups. Plaintiffs do not challenge the truthfulness of those elements of the 
statements. The analysis here focuses on Plaintiffs' contention that Seagate's marketing misrepresented the reliability and 
general performance of the drives. "
1883,1," The Court's review of the parties' fact statements and responses and the record evidence was time-consuming. Some of the 
fact statements are immaterial. Some of them are not statements of fact, but of opinion. (See, e.g., ECF No. 226, Pl.'s Stmt. 
Add'l Facts ¶¶ 17, 23.) In several instances, the parties failed to respond directly to a given statement, failed to provide support 
for a statement, or attempted to support a denial with evidence that did not actually provide support or with impermissible 
argument that is beside the point. (See, e.g., Pl.'s Resp. Image Media's LR 56.1(a)(3) Stmt. ¶ 12; ECF No. 237, Image Media's 
Resp. Pl.'s Stmt. Add'l Facts ¶ 27; ECF No. 240, Bellwood's Resp. Pl.'s Stmt. Add'l Facts ¶ 19.) ""[T]he purpose of Rule 56.1 
statements is to identify the relevant admissible evidence supporting the material facts—not to make factual or legal arguments."" 
LaSalvia v. City of Evanston, 806 F. Supp. 2d 1043, 1046 (N.D. Ill. 2011) (citing Cady v. Sheahan, 467 F.3d 1057, 1060 (7th Cir. 
2006)). The parties also repeatedly mischaracterize what the other side has purportedly admitted. The Court will not address 
each instance in which a party has failed to satisfy the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 and Local Rule 56.1 
but will simply say that it has disregarded immaterial facts, improperly-supported facts and denials of facts, and argument 
masquerading as fact. Bellwood filed a response to Paramount's Local Rule 56.1(b)(3)(C) statement of additional material facts. (ECF No. 240.) 
Bellwood also filed a separate ""reply"" to Paramount's response to Bellwood's Local Rule 56.1(a)(3) Statement. (ECF No. 239.) 
Paramount moves to strike the reply, and the Court grants the motion. Bellwood did not seek leave of court to file this extra 
document, which is not contemplated by Local Rule 56.1. "
1884,2," The Bellwood Code defines an ""off-site advertising sign"" as ""[a]ny sign, including, without limitation, a billboard, that advertises 
or directs attention to a business, commodity, service, or activity conducted, sold, or offered on property other than the lot on 
which the sign is located and meets current IDOT requirements within 660 feet of I-290 and I-294."" Bellwood, Ill. Code § 
156.203(A)(12)."
1884,3," IDOT regulations prohibit the construction of billboards in business areas on the same side of an interstate highway within five 
hundred feet of a location where a permit has already been issued for the construction of a billboard. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 92, § 
522.200."
1884,4, The parties' fact statements do not clarify at what time in 2012 Image Media made a firm offer. 
1885,5," The version of this letter that Paramount has submitted is dated October 25, 2013. The version of the letter that Image Media 
has submitted is dated October 22, 2013. "
1886,6," Magistrate Judge Cole, who supervised discovery and handled discovery motions in this case, barred Paramount from 
presenting a damages claim relating to a digital billboard and also barred David Quas, Paramount's president and CEO, from 
testifying about the present value of the future income of a billboard. (ECF Nos. 169, 176.) This Court overruled Paramount's 
objections to those rulings. (ECF No. 200.)"
1886,7," Judge Cole stated in a subsequent order: ""Image Media . . . argues that [plaintiff's expert's] opinion that the sign's design now 
depends on a variety of factors is an attempt to introduce a new site plan in violation of the Court's order barring Paramount from 
introducing new site plans after the close of fact discovery. Image Media is right that defendant cannot make its sign a 'moving 
target' by adopting an 'it depends strategy' at this late date. Image Media is entitled to know what sign Paramount intends to 
build, so it can defend Paramount's claims. Paramount should not be permitted to amend its sign any time Image Media points 
out a claimed design flaw."" (ECF No. 182 at 8 n.1 (citation omitted).) "
1889,8," There is no argument that there is anything unlawful or misleading about the kind of commercial speech Paramount intends to 
use on its proposed billboard."
1889,9," Paramount cites three decisions in which the Supreme Court invalidated commercial-speech restrictions for lack of a 
reasonable fit: Greater New Orleans Broadcasting Association, Inc. v. United States, 527 U.S. 173, 119 S. Ct. 1923, 144 L. Ed. 
2d 161 (1999); Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co., 514 U.S. 476, 115 S. Ct. 1585, 131 L. Ed. 2d 532 (1995); and City of Cincinnati v. 
Discovery Network, 507 U.S. 410, 113 S. Ct. 1505, 123 L. Ed. 2d 99 (1993). Those decisions are distinguishable because they 
involved situations where an entire regulatory scheme was irrational or the regulations at issue were swallowed by their 
exceptions. That is not the case here; there is only the limited exception for Bellwood-controlled property, which is not so 
pervasive as to undermine or counteract the effects of the billboard ban. Even with the exception, the billboard ban would 
continue to advance Bellwood's asserted interests. See Clear Channel Outdoor, Inc. v. City of N.Y., 594 F.3d 94, 107-08 (2d Cir. 
2010) (limited exceptions to zoning regulations banning outdoor advertising signs did not render regulatory scheme 
unconstitutionally underinclusive); see also Members of City Council v. Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U.S. 789, 811, 104 S. Ct. 
2118, 80 L. Ed. 2d 772 (1984) (""Even if some visual blight remains, a partial, content-neutral ban may nevertheless enhance the 
City's appearance.""). "
1890,10," Paramount also presents an argument that Bellwood's sign ordinance is an unconstitutional prior restraint. But it did not plead 
such a claim, nor are there any allegations that can be so construed. A plaintiff may not amend its complaint through arguments 
in a response brief to a motion for summary judgment. See Shanahan v. City of Chi., 82 F.3d 776, 781 (7th Cir. 1996). 
Furthermore, Paramount's prior-restraint argument is based on the exception to the billboard ban, yet, as the Court has 
discussed, Paramount's asserted injury is not traceable to the exception. "
1893,11," Paramount unsuccessfully attempts to dispute this fact by citing the opinion of Bellwood's mayor, Frank Pasquale, that 
Bellwood's financial condition was ""stable"" in October 2012. (ECF No. 232, Dep. of Frank Pasquale 16.) But Paramount cites no 
evidence that contradicts Tsiolis's specific statement about the existence of the deficit or its amount. Also unavailing is Paramount's argument that Tsiolis's statement is ""undermined"" by the subsequent proposed amendment of 
the 1156 Agreement's payment structure. ""[T]he test for rationality does not ask whether the benign justification was the actual 
justification."" Kopp, 725 F.3d at 686. The proper question is whether the evidence reveals a conceivable rational basis, 
notwithstanding any improper motivation, for Bellwood's opting to lease its property to Image Media rather than Paramount. See 
id. It does."
1893,12," Paramount also asserts that Bellwood should have implemented a formal bidding process for a lease on the Bellwood 
Property, and intimates that its failure to do so constituted wrongdoing. But Paramount does not cite any authority that supports 
this suggestion."
1893,13," Moreover, aside from Bellwood's home-rule status, 65 ILCS 5/11-76-1 empowers municipalities to lease their real estate for 
any term not exceeding ninety-nine years. "
1894,14," ""Conduct that impairs the opportunities of rivals and either does not further competition on the merits or does so in an 
unnecessarily restrictive way may be deemed anticompetitive. Conduct that merely harms competitors, however, while not 
harming the competitive process itself, is not anticompetitive."" Broadcom Corp. v. Qualcomm Inc., 501 F.3d 297, 308 (3d Cir. 
2007) (citation omitted); see also Brooke Grp. Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 509 U.S. 209, 225, 113 S. Ct. 2578, 
125 L. Ed. 2d 168 (1993) (""Even an act of pure malice by one business competitor against another does not, without more, state 
a claim under the federal antitrust laws; those laws do not create a federal law of unfair competition or purport to afford remedies 
for all torts committed by or against persons engaged in interstate commerce."") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). "
1897,1," Louisiana Revised Statutes 51:135 states, in pertinent part, ""All interlocutory judgments in the cases affected by this Part, and 
not otherwise provided for, shall be appealable."" No party to this action has raised any issue challenging this court's jurisdiction 
to hear the issues presented in this appeal. "
1900,1," Flywheel refers to CMT's contracts with the taxi companies as ""Restraining Agreements."" SACC ¶ 8. CMT refers to these 
contracts as ""CMT-Taxi Fleet Exclusivity Contracts"" and ""Taxicab Contracts."" Compl. ¶ 47; Dkt. No. 52, Mot. at 1. For purposes 
of deciding this motion, the Court will adopt Flywheel's terminology and refer to the contracts as ""Restraining Agreements."" "
1903,2," Flywheel argues that Levitt is not a competition case and so is inapplicable here. Oppo. at 11. The Ninth Circuit, however, 
described the Cel-Tech standard as one applicable to ""business-competitor cases"" and found that it was appropriate to use in "
1904,," Levitt because ""the crux of the business owners' complaint is that Yelp's conduct unfairly injures their economic interests to the 
benefit of other businesses who choose to advertise with Yelp."" Levitt, 765 F.3d at 1136. "
1905,3," CMT's motion includes a host of additional arguments that are improper for consideration upon a motion to dismiss. Included 
among these are arguments related to Flywheel's business practices and what are clearly factual disputes regarding the contract 
that CMT and Flywheel entered into in December 2014. To support these arguments, CMT has filed a request for judicial notice, 
attaching various news articles and website print-outs. Dkt. No. 60. Courts may take judicial notice of a fact ""that is not subject to 
reasonable dispute because it: (1) is generally known within the trial court's territorial jurisdiction; or (2) can be accurately and 
readily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned."" Fed. R. Evid. 201(b). Flywheel has not 
taken a position on CMT's request. Nevertheless, the Court finds that these documents are not appropriate for judicial notice. 
CMT apparently wishes the Court to take judicial notice of the truth of the content of these sources, but the facts contained 
therein are not generally known and cannot be accurately and readily determined. See id. Accordingly, the request for judicial 
notice is DENIED. In any event, the Court need not rely on these documents in making today's ruling. "
1919,1," Watson became part of Actavis, Inc., which became associated with Allergan, plc, and Watson then became part of Teva 
Pharmaceuticals Industries, Ltd. The defendant will be referred to here as Watson."
1919,2," Lidoderm is the brand name for lidocaine 5% patches that are used to relieve the pain of post-herpetic neuralgia (also known 
as ""after-shingles"" pain). Declaration of Jeffrey J. Leitzinger (Dkt. No. 522-1) ¶ 18."
1919,3," At the time of the patent litigation, Endo had an exclusive license from Teikoku to manufacture and sell the Lidoderm patches 
and subsequently manufactured and sold the authorized generic version of Lidoderm as well."
1919,4," A more detailed explanation of the factual background of this case, including the regulatory obligations of the FDA and patent 
litigation under the Hatch-Waxman Act (21 U.S.C. § 355(a)), is explained in my prior Orders, including Dkt. No. 117."
1919,5," The three named DPP plaintiffs are Drogueria Betances (""Betances""), Rochester Drug Co-Operative, Inc. (""Rochester""), and 
American Sales Company, LLC (""ASC""). "
1920,6," The EPPs acknowledge that some wholesaler Class Members may have assigned some or all of their entitlement to 
overcharges to Retailer Plaintiffs. Leitzinger Decl. ¶ 19 n.57. The EPPs' expert contends he can ""readily adjust Class volumes to 
reflect the assigned volumes."" Id. I do not in this Order determine whether Retailer Plaintiffs can opt-out or, if allowed to opt-out, 
whether those separate actions will proceed in conjunction with the certified classes. See Dkt. No. 231 at 10-12."
1920,7," The named EPPs are: (i) Allied Services Division Welfare Fund, (ii) City of Providence, (iii) International Union of Operating 
Engineers Local 49 Health and Welfare Fund, (iv) International Union of Operating Engineers Local 132 Health and Welfare 
Fund, (v) Iron Workers District Council of New England Welfare Fund, (vi) NECA-IBEW Welfare Trust Fund, (vii) United Food

1921,8," The other EPPs, including retailers, hospitals, and pharmacies, sell or provide the products to end consumers and (generally) 
not to entities who intend to pass them along to end users. ""Consumers"" or ""end-users"" as used in this Order refer to the 
individual end-users who the drugs were prescribed to."
1921,9," These TPPs are insurers, health and welfare plans, plan sponsors, and self-insured employers. DeBree Decl. ¶ 3. As described 
somewhat simplistically by the EPPs, Lidoderm is offered in three end-payor markets: to cash payors, to commercial insurers, 
and to Part D Medicare insurers. EPP Mot. 9."
1921,10," Defendants' expert Navarro states that in studies conducted in 2013-2014, health plan copayments for brand name drugs 
ranged from $7 to $300 and deductibles ranged from $500 to $2000. Navarro Rep. ¶ 26."
1921,11," The EPPs assert that in no-insurance situations, pharmacies have records of consumers' prescription drug purchases. 
Declaration of W. Paul DeBree [Dkt. No. 524-2] ¶ 24. "
1922,12," Drug formularies are the list of approved drugs accepted by the various TPPs, and created and administrated through the 
PBMs. DeBree Decl. ¶ 36; Singer Decl. ¶ 105; Hughes Decl. ¶¶ 11, 16, 20. They can be open or closed, with open formularies 
allowing access to more drugs. The formularies also have various tiers, typically 3 or 4 but up to 7, with Tier One typically 
including generic drugs and having the lowest amount of copay or coinsurance. For example, named EPP plaintiff Iron Workers 
District Council of New England Welfare Fund's plan had three formulary tiers where the copay was $15 for generic drugs (Tier 
1), $30 for preferred brand drugs (Tier 2), and $45 for non-preferred brand drugs (Tier 3). Navarro Rep. ¶ 27. If the member 
used a mail order pharmacy, the copays rose to $30/$60/$90 and if the member went to an out-of-network pharmacy, they were 
required to pay in advance and then apply for reimbursement through the Fund's PBM. Id. "
1925,13," The Delay Period used by Leitzinger starts on the assumed March 31, 2013 entry date (but-for defendants' Agreement) and 
ends on the actual Watson entry date of September 15, 2013. The Overcharge Period is the period of time beginning on March 
31, 2013 but extending until the point in time where according to Leitzinger the generic entry produced the full savings 
associated with generic competition. Leitzinger Decl. ¶¶ 38, 39."
1925,14," Defendants do not challenge DPPs' motion as to the adequacy of interim class counsel. On May 20, 2014, I appointed Faruqi 
& Faruqi LLP, Garwin, Gerstein & Fisher LLP, and Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP, as Interim Co-Lead Counsel for the 
proposed Direct Purchaser Class, and Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP as Interim Liaison Counsel for the proposed DPP 
class, based on a showing of experience and adequacy. Dkt. No. 60. Those firms have ably and vigorously litigated this case, 
and nothing has occurred to undermine my initial determination of their experience and adequacy. "
1926,15," In addition, defendants' expert testified that he could not recall and could not identify any instance where DPPs paid less for 
generic Lidoderm than for brand after generic entry and paid less for generic Lidoderm after Endo's AG entry. Declaration of 
Peter Kohn ISO DPP Reply [Dkt. No. 592], Ex. 52, Transcript of October 13, 2016 Deposition of Gregory Leonard at 91-93, 96, 
108, 290."
1926,16," The cases defendants rely on that disapprove the use of averaged or aggregate approaches addressed materially different 
antitrust theories in materially different markets. See, e.g., In re Optical Disk Drive Antitrust Litig., 303 F.R.D. 311, 321 (N.D. Cal. 
2014) (price-fixing conspiracy to prevent trending decline in prices); Food Lion, LLC v. Dean Foods Co., 312 F.R.D. 472, 489 
(E.D. Tenn. 2016) (rejecting averaging approach to determining injury from alleged conspiracy to inflate prices of milk where 
model assumed price impact across areas where no impact was found); see also In re Celexa & Lexapro Mktg. & Sales 
Practices Litig., 315 F.R.D. 116, 128 (D. Mass. 2016) (rejecting plaintiffs' attempt to rely on aggregate statistical evidence to 
prove ""but for causation"" in an off-label promotion case because of flaws in the statistical analysis). "
1928,17," For example, with respect to the generic entry date issue, defendants argue individualized inquiry is necessary because the 
date of entry — and how much generic Watson had on hand at the various possible earlier entry dates — impacts whether DPPs 
would be able to buy sufficient generic stock to fulfill their needs; if the supply from Watson was limited, price might well have 
increased or led to ""rationing"" by Watson. Def. DPP Oppo. at 14-15. The DPPs respond that Leonard's testimony and Watson's 
own documents support a factual finding that supply and rationing would not have been an issue. Leitzinger Reb. Decl. ¶¶ 28 — 
30; DPP Reply at 6-9. With respect to Anda sales — Watson's subsidiary selling brand product it received from Endo during the 
Delay Period at a discount below other distributors — and defendants' argument that Leitzinger's model fails to account for those 
sales, the DPPs respond that: (i) the Anda sales occurred because of the settlement (and so are not relevant to a but-for world); 
(ii) the discounts offered by Anda were smaller than the discounts offered by Endo during the same period, so that the class did 
not receive greater price concessions; and (iii) those Anda sales were excluded in any event from Leitzinger's damages model. 
Def. DPP. Oppo. at 17; DPP Reply at 9; Leitzinger Reb. Decl. ¶¶ 24-25. With respect to assignments, the Big Three DPPs 
(AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal Health and McKesson) have allegedly assigned one-third of their claims to opt-out plaintiffs. 
Defendants argue that those assignments and exclusions mean that individualized inquiry into the terms of the assignments and 
underlying contracts is required to assure the correct numbers are put into Leitzinger's model. Def. DPP Oppo. at 18-19. 
However, Leitzinger's model can be adjusted to account for opt-outs and related assignments. Leitzinger Reb. Decl. ¶ 31, DPP 
Reply at 10. That type of inquiry does not undermine the superiority of proceeding as a class action or call into question the 
methodology behind or reliability of Leitzinger's aggregate damages model. "
1929,18," There is a factual dispute over whether Cedardale Distributors is a part of Cardinal Health or a separate legal entity. Compare 
Leonard Rep. Decl. ¶ 12 with Leitzinger Reb. Decl. at 12 n.39. The status of Cedardale Distributors is not determinative to this 
motion. Leonard also argues that if you take March 31, 2013 as the entry date — which is what Leitzinger did for his primary 
analysis — then Drogueria Central is likewise not a class member. Leonard Rep. ¶ 13. Leitzinger responds that simply because 
Drogueria Central stopped buying Lidoderm as of February 2013, should not be excluded from the class since the start date may 
end up being earlier than March 2013. Leitzinger Reb. Decl. ¶ 20. At this stage of the proceedings, Drogueria Central should not 
be excluded from the class."
1929,19," The purchases by the 29 DPPs who used GPO-secured prices account for under 10% of defendants' sales to direct 
purchasers during the relevant time frame. "
1930,20," As Leonard explains it ""[b]randed drug manufacturers are more likely to use wholesalers, while generic drug manufacturers 
are more likely to eliminate intermediaries and sell directly, e.g., to retailers. Thus, after generic entry, direct purchasers that 
purchased and resold the branded drug from the branded manufacturer prior to generic entry may find that their volumes had 
declined, with the losses flowing to other direct purchasers (such as retailers or other generic-only direct purchasers)."" Leonard 
Decl. ¶ 78; see also Leitzinger Decl. ¶ 46 (""the circumstance in which, following generic entry, some Class members' customers 
buy generics directly from generic manufacturers and 'bypass' the wholesaler"")."
1930,21," In support of their by-pass theory, defendants admit that they rely on Valley Drug Co. v. Geneva Pharms., Inc., 350 F.3d 1181, 
1189 (11th Cir. 2003), a case which has been widely rejected by courts, including courts in this District. See, e.g., Braintree 
Laboratories, Inc. v. McKesson Corp., No. 11-80233 MISC JSW (JSC), 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 121499, 2011 WL 5025096 (N.D. 
Cal. Oct. 20, 2011) (""whether McKesson and other class members somehow benefitted from the delay of the introduction of 
generics to the market is irrelevant to the merits of the underlying action"" and denying discovery into whether DPP profited from 
antitrust conduct). Courts have also rejected attempts to decrease damages under that theory. See, e.g., In re Prograf Antitrust 
Litig., 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 180899, 2014 WL 7641156, at *4 (D. Mass. Dec. 23, 2014) (""reducing damages to plaintiff 
wholesalers under a bypass defense is inconsistent with Hanover Shoe"") (quotation and citations omitted); In re Skelaxin 
(Metaxalone) Antitrust Litig., 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 66707, 2014 WL 2002887, at *4-6 (E.D. Tenn. May 15, 2014) (same); cf. 
Wellbutrin XL, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 90075, 2011 WL 3563385, at *16 (noting that Leitzinger could account for bypass if 
necessary in aggregate damages model). "
1931,22," The fact that the Supreme Court recently reemphasized the Puerto Rico is not a ""separate sovereign"" for purposes of the 
double jeopardy clause does not undermine the First Circuit's case law interpreting the Sherman Act. Def. DPP Oppo. at 25 
n.110 (citing Puerto Rico v. Sánchez Valle, 136 S. Ct. 1863, 195 L. Ed. 2d 179 (2016)). "
1932,23," Examples of the special verdict questions proposed by the EPPS include: (i) did defendants reach an agreement delaying 
competition in the Lidoderm market? (ii) Did defendants' Agreement have the effect of artificially maintaining and inflating the 
price of Lidoderm and generic Lidoderm? (iii) Did defendants' Agreement impact plaintiffs and members of the class by forcing 
them to pay more for Lidoderm and generic Lidoderm than they would have in the absence of defendants' Agreement? (iv) 
Absent the Agreement, would a generic version of Lidoderm have come to the market before September 15, 2013? (v) If so, 
what is a reasonable estimate as to when? (vi) Would an authorized generic have entered at or about the same time? Id. "
1933,24," While defendants challenge the adequacy of the named EPP plaintiffs, they do not challenge the adequacy of the counsel I 
appointed on an interim basis to prosecute the EPPs claims; Girard Gibbs LLP, Cohen Milstein Sellers & Toll PLLC, and Heins 
Mills & Olson PLC as Interim Co-Lead Counsel; Joseph Saveri Law Firm, Inc. as Interim Liaison Counsel; and an Executive 
Committee comprised of Hilliard & Shadowen LLP, Miller Law LLC, Motley Rice LLC, Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP, and 
The Dugan Law Firm, APLC. Dkt. No. 63. These firms have ably and vigorously litigated this case, and nothing has occurred to 
undermine my initial determination of their experience and adequacy."
1933,25," As discussed above, the DPPs' expert Dr. Leitzinger takes a third approach and uses the purchase ratios between generic 
and brand Lidoderm after Watson's entry and applies that ratio to determine his but-for cost. "
1934,26, Purchasers who purchased brand Lidoderm after generic entry are excluded from the class as Brand Loyalists. 
1935,27," Defendants also argue that consumers who reached their out of pocket maximums could not have been harmed whether or 
not generic Lidoderm had been available earlier. Def. EPP Oppo. at 11-12. Plaintiffs point out that if that type of consumer 
purchased Lidoderm even once before hitting the maximum, the consumer would be injured and appropriately included in the 
class. In any event, if a consumer paid nothing for the Lidoderm in this situation, the consumer would not be injured by that 
transaction, but the TPP who actually paid the costs would and the aggregate damages award would be unaffected. "
1936,28," It is also possible, depending on the facts found by the jury, that in absence of the Agreement and if Watson entered at risk 
earlier than it eventually did, Endo could have implemented a ""discount brand"" strategy contemplated in some of Endo's 
documents (Endo would have discounted its brand drug to compete with Watson's generic) and these Brand Loyalists would 
have been injured and properly considered part of the class. In reality, Endo did not implement that strategy and instead followed 
a profit maximizing strategy where it increased its prices on Watson's entry."
1936,29," Defendants rely on In re Class 8 Transmission Indirect Purchaser Antitrust Litig., 140 F. Supp. 3d 339, 349 (D. Del. 2015), but 
the section of the decision relied on by defendants addresses alleged conflicts and inadequacy of class representatives, and is 
not otherwise persuasive. "
1937,30," Singer also finds that even using Hughes' but-for price, GEHA paid more for brand Lidoderm in some of its transactions. 
Singer Reply Decl. ¶ 46."
1937,31," See, e.g., In re Nexium Antitrust Litig., 777 F.3d 9, 27 (1st Cir. 2015) (""defendants incorrectly assume that if a class member 
offsets an overcharge through later savings attributable to the same or related transaction, there is no injury. But antitrust injury 
occurs the moment the purchaser incurs an overcharge, whether or not that injury is later offset. . . . Here, if a class member is 
overcharged, there is an injury, even if that class member suffers no damages."" (internal citations and quotations omitted)). "
1938,32," Defendants rely on Ironworkers Local Union 68 v. AstraZeneca Pharms., LP, 634 F.3d 1352, 1364 (11th Cir. 2011), a RICO 
and fraud case based on the manufacture's promotion of off-label drug uses. The court concluded that because ""the insurers 
assumed the risk of paying for all prescriptions of drugs covered by their policies, including medically unnecessary or 
inappropriate prescriptions—even those caused by fraudulent marketing"" the premiums were adequate to compensate for that 
""known risk."" Id. at 1364. Not only is this case outside the antitrust/end-payor context, but it has also been disagreed with by 
more recent cases. See In re Avandia Mktg., Sales Practices & Prod. Liab. Litig., 804 F.3d 633, 641 (3d Cir. 2015), cert. denied 
sub nom. GlaxoSmithKline LLC v. Allied Servs. Div. Welfare Fund, 136 S. Ct. 2409, 195 L. Ed. 2d 780 (2016); In re Testosterone 
Replacement Therapy Prods. Liab. Litig. Coordinated Pretrial Proceedings, 159 F. Supp. 3d 898, 920 (N.D. Ill. 2016); In re 
Neurontin Mktg. & Sales Practices Litig., 799 F. Supp. 2d 110, 120 (D. Mass. 2011), aff'd, 712 F.3d 21 (1st Cir. 2013). 
Defendants' reliance on pay-for-delay cases were the injured parties were not ascertainable by common proof (based a legal 
standard that has been rejected by the Ninth Circuit in Briseno) are not persuasive. In re Skelaxin (Metaxalone) Antitrust Litig., 
299 F.R.D. 555, 571 (E.D. Tenn. 2014), reconsideration denied, No. 1:12-MD-2343, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 58359, 2014 WL 
1623705 (E.D. Tenn. Apr. 23, 2014); Vista Healthplan, Inc. v. Cephalon, Inc., No. 2:06-CV-1833, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 74846, 
2015 WL 3623005, at *12 (E.D. Pa. June 10, 2015), reconsideration denied, No. 2:06-CV-1833, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 107013, 
2015 WL 4737288 (E.D. Pa. Aug. 4, 2015). "
1939,33," Navarro asserts that to determine whether EPPs were injured, he needed to consult PBM records, TTP-PBM agreements, and 
PBM-manufacturer agreements. If that analysis indeed showed no injury to a significant portion of the EPPs, it could undermine 
certifiability. However, he does not attempt to conduct that sort of analysis and does not show that there is a wide swath of EPPs 
who were uninjured. Instead, his actual analysis of a discrete number of documents relevant to a few EPPs essentially shows 
that the apportionment of damages will require analysis of individual PBM and health plan contracts and purchase records. See, 
e.g., Navarro Rep. ¶¶ 45, 47, 52. That issue is not in dispute and does not preclude certification."
1939,34," Defendants argue that In re Wellbutrin XL Antitrust Litig., 308 F.R.D. 134 (E.D. Pa. 2015), the court relied on Comcast to find 
the class was not ascertainable. Def. EPP Oppo. at 23. However, the Wellbutrin court recognized that case did not present ""a 
pure Comcast problem"" and actually cited favorably Comcast's finding that at the class certification stage, damages "
1940,," ""[c]alculations need not be exact."" Id. at 149. In Skelaxin, the court noted the ongoing dispute over how far courts should stretch 
Comcast and simply noted (but did not rest on) that ""[g]iven Comcast's requirement that the damages model and the theory of 
liability match, [an overinclusive damages mode] could be problematic."" 299 F.R.D. at 575 (emphasis added)."
1940,35," Therefore, the cases defendants rely on rejecting certification because the class sought was not administratively ascertainable 
are inapposite. See, e.g., In re Skelaxin (Metaxalone) Antitrust Litig., 299 F.R.D. 555, 572 (E.D. Tenn. 2014), reconsideration 
denied, No. 1:12-MD-2343, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 58359, 2014 WL 1623705 (E.D. Tenn. Apr. 23, 2014) (denying class 
certification because of lack of ascertainability of EPPs, given role of PBMs and others in the distribution and payment chains). "
1941,36," As noted above, defendants do not challenge the adequacy of the counsel appointed to represent the EPP class on an interim 
basis, and nothing since that time has undermined that finding."
1941,37," Defendants will be allowed to take limited fact discovery to test the adequacy of any proposed additional named class 
representative. "
1942,38," Defendants rely on In re Skelaxin (Metaxalone) Antitrust Litig., 299 F.R.D. 555, 577 (E.D. Tenn. 2014), where the court found 
that there were conflicts precluding a finding of adequacy. There, PBMs were included in the class definition (unlike here) and 
the district court found that because PBMs bore some-price risk in the transaction (which I have rejected here) and that price-risk 
was not accurately accounted for in the plaintiffs' expert's modeling. That is not so here. Moreover, this is an apportionment 
case, not a case where ""each class member will have to offer proof that necessarily will involve arguing that a threshold number 
of other [class members] would not have gotten"" damages. See In re NCAA I-A Walk-On Football Players Litig., No. C04-1254C, 
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 28824, 2006 WL 1207915, at *8 (W.D. Wash. May 3, 2006)."
1942,39," Presumably, defendants will also move for summary judgment on some of these state law claims, which could reduce the 
number of state laws at issue. "
1944,40," At most, defendants identify a general risk (which DeBree explains can be contained by contractual provisions in the PBM 
agreements) and point to one instance where a PBM gave a TPP sponsor a rebate of $11 per Lidoderm transaction, while 
Endo's own records show no rebates given to that PBM during that time frame. Plaintiffs challenge that assertion, arguing that 
the PBM at issue likely received rebates through another PBM."
1944,41," In In re Wellbutrin XL Antitrust Litig., 308 F.R.D. 134 (E.D. Pa. 2015), the court granted a motion to decertify a class of indirect 
purchasers (here called end payors) because under Third Circuit precedent which is not regularly followed in the Ninth Circuit, 
the indirect purchaser class was not ""administratively feasible"" to ascertain. In reaching that decision, with respect to DeBree "
1945,," and another expert's testimony, the court noted: ""Neither expert, however, examined or analyzed these pharmaceutical records, 
or the Aetna data analyzed by [defense expert], to show that they could be used to ascertain PBMs and individual consumers. 
The Court is not persuaded by these experts' conclusory statements. Even if it were established that such records exist, the IPC 
has not introduced any evidence showing that such records are obtainable or can be used in an administratively feasible fashion 
to ascertain class members. The IPC's own expert testified that it could be difficult to obtain purchase data from PBMs. DeBree 
Dep. 286:22-288:16. Indeed, the IPC served subpoenas on several PBMs during the recent discovery period, but did not obtain 
any records from those PBMs. This heightens the Court's concern that such pharmaceutical records may not be obtainable for 
use in the ascertainability inquiry."" Id. at 150. The Wellbutrin court did not exclude DeBree. Here significant PBM records 
(covering 16% of the class) have been secured from OptumRX and those records support plaintiffs' ascertainability argument."
1945,42," Of course, post-Briseno, acertainability is no longer the hurdle it might have been at the class certification stage."
1945,43," Navarro points to the conclusion of the FTC that ""PBMs do bear some risk of their plan client's drug spending,"" because 
spread pricing may not cover the total cost of any particular prescription. (Navarro Rep. ¶¶ 15, 24(i), 75-78) That is not evidence 
that PBM records will not be able to provide a reliable source of proof about class ascertainability and a source of common proof 
on damages. "
1946,44," Defense counsel had sought premium-related discovery from specific EPP class members. I denied them access to that 
discovery because: ""the requests are more burdensome than probative and not proportional. The application of the pass-on 
defense does not appear to be appropriate in this context. For example, defendants have not cited any testimony from the 
30(b)(6) of Local 49 (Johnson), despite having taken that deposition, that Local 49 was able to ""recoup"" amounts spent in the

1955,3," NECA observed that the Supreme Court has ""some 'tension' in its case law"" as to whether class standing is a component of 
Article III standing or instead has its origins in Rule 23. 693 F.3d at 160-61; see also Ret. Bd. of the Policemen's Annuity & 
Benefit Fund of the City of Chicago v. Bank of N.Y., 775 F.3d 154, 160 (2d Cir. 2014) (noting ""the murky line between traditional 
Article III standing and so-called 'class standing.'""). However, the Supreme Court has stated that ""'[t]he standing determination is 
quite separate from certification of the class.'"" NECA, 693 F.3d at 161 (quoting Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343, 358 n.6, 116 S.

1963,7," In In re: LIBOR-Based Financial Instruments Antitrust Litigation, Judge Buchwald has issued six decisions to date that concern 
claims directed to the alleged manipulation of the LIBOR. This Court refers to them by the abbreviated captions LIBOR I, 935 F. 
Supp. 2d 666 (S.D.N.Y. 2013); LIBOR II, 962 F. Supp. 2d 606 (S.D.N.Y. 2013); LIBOR III, 27 F. Supp. 3d 447 (S.D.N.Y. 2014); 
LIBOR IV, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 147561, 2015 WL 6243526 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 20, 2015); LIBOR V, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 149629,

20, 2016). "
1965,8," In LIBOR VI, Judge Buchwald was faced with claims from two different putative derivatives classes, one consisting of those 
who participated in negotiated transactions and one who purchased futures contracts on an exchange. 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
175929, 2016 WL 7378980, at *19-23. As summarized in her decision, the allegations appeared to include details about the 
terms and markets for each type of transaction that are not present in this case, including how the LIBOR factored into trading 
prices on the open market, the purpose of certain instruments, the liquidity of certain transactions and how LIBOR manipulations 
affected different transactions at different points in time. See id. "

1967,13," Further, by focusing on the domestic effects of a defendant's conduct, the FTAIA arguably may apply a less-exacting standard 
than the due process threshold to exercise personal jurisdiction over a foreign defendant. See generally Waldman v. Palestine 
Liberation Org., 835 F.3d 317, 339 (2d Cir. 2016) (""[T]he mere fact that harm in the forum is foreseeable [is] insufficient for the 
purpose of establishing specific personal jurisdiction over a defendant."") (quotation marks omitted). The Court is unaware of any 
authority that discusses the FTAIA relationship to the Supreme Court's more recent decisions concerning the due process limits "
1968,," on personal jurisdiction, and it does not reach the issue here. See generally Daimler AG v. Bauman, 134 S. Ct. 746, 187 L. Ed. 
2d 624 (2014); Walden v. Fiore, 134 S. Ct. 1115, 188 L. Ed. 2d 12 (2014). "
1976,14," The Supreme Court vacated the Second Circuit's analysis of RICO extraterritoriality, but, in doing so, did not address the 
extraterritorial application of the federal wire fraud statute. 136 S. Ct. at 2105. "
1981,15," Because plaintiffs have not pointed to any Master Agreement that applies to their claims, the Court does not reach the issue of 
whether a defendant's consent to jurisdiction in a Master Agreement would also encompass plaintiffs' RICO, CEA and Sherman 
Act claims. See, e.g., LIBOR IV, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 147561, 2015 WL 6243526, at *34 (giving a ""broad reading"" to the "
1982,," forum-selection clause of ISDA agreements while ""caution[ing]"" that the claims ""must relate to the particular contractual 
relationship,"" and observing that the clause does not provide jurisdiction for ""all fraud claims""). "
1985,16," The Second Circuit has analyzed national contacts pursuant to Rule 4(k)(2), Fed. R. Civ. P., which states: ""For a claim that 
arises under federal law, serving a summons or filing a waiver of service establishes personal jurisdiction over a defendant if: (A) 
the defendant is not subject to jurisdiction in any state's courts of general jurisdiction; and (B) exercising jurisdiction is consistent 
with the United States Constitution and laws."" Rule 4(k)(2) ""'extends the reach of federal courts to impose jurisdiction over the 
person of all defendants against whom federal law claims are made and who can be constitutionally subjected to the jurisdiction 
of the courts of the United States.'"" Chew, 143 F.3d at 27 (quoting Purposes of Revision, Advisory Committee Notes, 1993 
Amendments). "
1987,17," A Barclays manager in New York appears to be the only United States-based individual employed by any Foreign Defendant 
who is alleged to have been involved in the Euribor manipulation. (Compl't ¶ 42-43.) Its New York manager supervised 
Moryoussef. (Compl't ¶¶ 42-43.) Barclays has provisionally settled plaintiffs' claims against it and its motion to dismiss is 
withdrawn without prejudice. "
1990,18," In a footnote, defendants urge the Court to dismiss all claims against ICAP pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), Fed. R. Civ. P. (Def. 
Mem. at 17 n.19.) Because the argument is raised in summary fashion and this Court concludes that it does not have personal 
jurisdiction over ICAP, it does not reach the issue of whether the Complaint states a claim for relief as to ICAP. "
1993,1," The Court refers to Comcast and Comcast Spotlight collectively as ""Defendants."" "
1994,2," The Court takes the facts presented in the Background from Plaintiff's Amended Complaint and presumes them as true for 
purposes of resolving the pending motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6). See Teamsters Local Union No. 705 v. Burlington 
Northern Santa Fe, LLC, 741 F.3d 819, 823 (7th Cir. 2014); Alam v. Miller Brewing Co., 709 F. 3d 662, 665-66 (7th Cir. 2013); 
see also Bell Atl. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007). The Court also presumes the 
parties' familiarity with the Court's prior opinion in this case. See Viamedia Inc. v. Comcast Corp., No. 16-cv-5486, 218 F. Supp. 
3d 674, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 152990, 2016 WL 6568074 (N.D. Ill. Nov. 4, 2016) (published op.)."
1994,3, Viamedia alleges that Comcast repeated its conduct in other DMAs outside of Chicago and Detroit. (R. 40 at ¶¶ 161-62.) 
1995,4," The Court previously outlined the standards for monopolization and attempted monopolization under Section 2 of the Sherman 
Act. See Viamedia, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 152990, 2016 WL 6568074, at *17-18. "
1997,5," The Court also notes that Comcast's refusal to deal with Viamedia did not, by itself, exclude MVPDs from participating in the 
Interconnects. Instead, it had the temporary effect of excluding such MVPDs, presumably because of their representation 
contracts with Viamedia. Comcast's alleged tying arrangement, however, resulted in the temporary exclusion of MVPDs. "
2000,*," Michelle D. Hotten, J., participated in the hearing of this case while still an active member of this Court but did not participate in 
either the preparation or adoption of this opinion. "
2001,1," Appellant's questions, as originally presented, were as follows:"
2001,1," . ""Whether the lower court erred in applying Maryland rules of insurance contract construction in its interpretation of the 
Prior Acts [*5]  exclusion by failing to give meaning to the term 'Any Insured'?"""
2001,2," . ""Whether the lower court erred in applying Maryland rules of insurance contract construction in its interpretation of the 
Prior Acts exclusion by disregarding the plain meaning of the word 'for'?"" "
2002,3," . ""Whether the lower court erred in applying Maryland rules of insurance contract construction in its interpretation of the 
Prior Acts exclusion by disregarding the plain meaning of the word 'and'?"""
2002,4," . ""Whether the lower court erred in applying Maryland rules of insurance contract construction in its interpretation of the 
Prior Acts exclusion by failing to give effect to the definition of 'Subsidiary'?"""
2002,5," . ""Whether the lower court erred in applying Maryland rules of insurance contract construction by interpreting the Prior 
Acts exclusion so as to violate the reasonable expectations of the Insured that a follow-form insurer will follow the primary 
insurer's interpretation of the policy?"""
2002,6," . ""Whether the lower court erred in applying Maryland rules of insurance contract construction in interpreting the Prior Acts 
exclusion by adopting an interpretation that is inconsistent with other evidence that coverage was intended in this [*6]  
case, including the drafter's interpretation of the exclusion, and the fact the primary insurer paid its $10 million in limits to 
defend Cristal?"""
2002,7," . ""Whether the lower court erred in failing to correctly apply Maryland's 'potentiality' rule regarding an insurer's defense 
obligation by ignoring the specific allegations in the underlying complaints that are potentially within the scope of 
coverage?"""
2002,8," . ""Whether the lower court erred in applying the rejected 'gravamen' test to determine XL's duty to defend the underlying 
complaints?"""
2002,9," . ""Whether the lower court failed to properly construe the Allocation clause, and erred in concluding that the Allocation 
Clause was inapplicable and not in conflict with the Prior Acts exclusion?"""
2002,10," . ""Whether the lower court erred in failing to address whether XL is estopped by its conduct from taking the position that 
the Prior Acts exclusion bars coverage, where XL waited nearly three years after notice to deny coverage based on the 
Prior Acts exclusion when it knew Zurich was defending despite the exclusion, and it led Cristal to believe to Cristal's 
detriment that XL would take the same position as Zurich?"""
2002,2," The complaint filed in the Haley Paint Company, et al. v. E.I. Dupont De Nemours and Company, et al, Case No. 10-cv-00318-
RDB, action describes titanium dioxide as a dry chemical powder that is primarily used [*8]  as a white pigment. It is by far the world's most widely used pigment for 
providing whiteness, brightness, and opacity (it hides or masks other colors) to many products, particularly paints and other 
coatings. Consumed in more than 170 countries, it is one of the most important inorganic chemicals used in the production 
of goods. Given its ubiquity in global industries, Titanium Dioxide has been called a ""quality of life"" or ""life-style"" product, in 
that consumption rates tend to correlate with standards of living."
2002,*," * * The vast majority (over 90%) of Titanium Dioxide is consumed by customers in the coatings, plastics, and paper industries. 
Titanium Dioxide is also used in synthetic fiber production and to make inks, pharmaceuticals (e.g., tablet coatings), "
2003,," toothpaste, sunscreen, cosmetics (e.g., rouge, eyeshadow), food (e.g., candies, icings, salad dressings, cheese, 
confections, pet food), rubber, ceramic, and other products. It is also nonflammable and nontoxic and has replaced lead 
compounds in residential paints."
2003,*," * * Given Titanium Dioxide's value and the lack of competitive substitutes for it, demand for Titanium Dioxide tends to be 
inelastic, in that loss in volume arising from [*9]  a price increase tends to be small relative to the magnitude of the increase 
in price. This demand inelasticity also exists because the cost of Titanium Dioxide typically represents only a small share of 
the total cost of manufacturing the products which use it as an input."
2003,3," The Court of Appeals defined a claims-made insurance policy as ""'policies [that] cover liability inducing events if and when a 
claim is made during the policy term, irrespective of when the events occurred.'"" Mut. Fire, Marine & Inland Ins. Co. v. Vollmer, 
306 Md. 243, 252, 508 A.2d 130 (1986) (quoting John K. Parker,  [*10] Untimely Demise of the ""Claims Made"" Insurance Form? 
A Critique of Stine v. Continental Casualty Company, 1983 Det.C.L.Rev. 25, 27-28)."
2003,4," ""'An excess policy may be written in two forms: as a stand-alone policy or as a policy that ""follows form."". . . A stand-alone 
excess policy is an independent insuring agreement. In contrast, a ""follows form"" excess policy incorporates by reference the 
terms of the underlying policy and is designed to match the coverage provided by the underlying policy.'"" Johnson Controls, Inc. 
v. London Market, 2010 WI 52, 325 Wis. 2d 176, 784 N.W.2d 579, 587 n.7 (Wis. 2010) (quoting 23 Eric Mills Holmes, Holmes' 
Appleman on Insurance 2d § 145.1 (interim vol. 2003))."
2003,5," The first, Endorsement No. 1, applied to CIC Ltd., and is tied to its April 24, 2007 creation. Endorsement No. 1 stated: The Underwriter shall not be liable for Loss on account of any Claim made against any Insured based upon, arising out of 
or attributable to Wrongful Acts, including Interrelated Wrongful Acts, committed, attempted or allegedly committed or 
attempted in whole or in part prior to April 24, 2007 for Cristal Inorganic Chemicals, Ltd. "
2004,, (Bold words are defined terms in the Primary Policy).
2004,6," Haley Paint Co., et al. was consolidated with Isaac Industries, Inc., et al., which was filed on February 12, 2010, and alleged 
the same claims. "
2005,7," Specifically, the Los Gatos complaint alleges violations of antitrust statutes in Arizona, California, the District of Columbia, 
Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New 
York, North Carolina, North Dakota, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, and West Virginia."
2005,8," The Los Gatos complaint alleges violations of consumer protection statutes in Arkansas, California, the District of Columbia, 
Florida, Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Vermont. "
2006,9," Endorsement 3 states, in relevant part:"
2006,3," . Company Liability Coverage The following Insuring Clause D is added to Section I: D. COMPANY LIABILITY COVERAGE The Underwriter shall pay on behalf of the Company all Loss for which the Company becomes legally obligated to pay on 
account of any Claim first made against the Company during the Policy Period or, if exercised, during the Extended 
Reporting Period, for a Wrongful Act taking place before or during the Policy Period. Solely with respect to coverage under Insuring Clause D: a. Any reference in the definition [*20]  of ""Claim"" or ""Loss"" to Insured Persons shall also mean the Company. b. The definition of Wrongful Act is amended by adding the following: ,or (iii) by the Company, c. Any reference to ""Insuring Clause C"" in Items 4, 8 and 9 of the Declarations, Section IV, Exclusions, or in Subsection 
V.B. or C shall also include Insuring Clause D. d. The following clause is deleted from the first sentence of Subsection V.D.: ""(including the Company in a Claim other 
than an Employment Practices Claim)"" "
2007,10," The letter also stated that the XL Policy ""is not a duty to defend policy."" (Emphasis supplied). "
2008,11," Appellant served XL on September 9, 2013, in Connecticut. Maryland Rule 2-321(b)(1) allows a defendant served outside of 
the State but within the United States 60 days to file an answer. "
2011,12, XL attached an affidavit sworn by its counsel and two exhibits produced by Lockton. 
2014,13," The Primary Policy defines ""Insureds"" as, ""any one or more Insured Persons and the Company."" ""Insured Persons"" are 
defined as, ""any person who has been, now is or shall become a duly elected director or a duly elected or appointed officer of 
Manager of the Company; and elected or appointed officer or Manager of the Company while serving in an Outside Position; and 
if Employee Liability Coverage is granted as set forth in Item 10 of the Declarations, any Employee of the Company."" ""Company"" 
is defined as, ""the Parent Company and its Subsidiaries."" The Parent Company in the Primary Policy is CIC US, of which 
Appellant is a Subsidiary. "
2017,14," Given that we determine that the contract language is unambiguous, we need not consider extrinsic evidence. See Clendenin 
Bros., 390 Md. at 459 (stating that only after the contractual language is determined to be ambiguous will the court consider 
extrinsic evidence of the parties' intent). Nonetheless, even if this Court concluded that the language of the Prior Acts Exclusions 
is susceptible to more than one interpretation by a reasonably prudent person, the extrinsic evidence does not convince us of 
Appellant's position. Appellant argues that the circuit court should have considered Zurich's interpretation of the policy language as extrinsic 
evidence. We note that Zurich's interpretation of the policy language that Appellant urges we consider occurred after its initial 
denial of coverage. The evidence shows that Zurich initially denied coverage because it interpreted the exclusion in the same 
manner as the circuit court, and then, possibly for business reasons, decided to extend coverage later. Therefore, the evidence 
of Zurich's change in coverage decision is not very strong evidence of the intent of the parties at the time of contract formation. 
See Tackney v. U.S. Naval Academy Alumni Association, Inc., 408 Md. 700, 717, 971 A.2d 309 (2009) (""[t]he construction 
placed upon the ambiguous language before any controversy has arisen holds significant importance.""). "
2022,15," On appeal, the only argument that Appellant has advanced that can be construed as concerning the detriment element is a 
single sentence, in which that Appellant claims it ""has been unexpectedly funding its own defense since Zurich paid its policy 
limits, as well as funding this action as a result."" That detriment, however, springs from XL's denial of coverage and is not 
independently tied to any representation by XL or reliance by Appellant. "
2023,1," Plaintiffs are the union whose members have performed most of Con Ed's asphalt patch-paving work for approximately the past 
ten years, Local 175 of the United Plant & Production Workers Union (""Local 175""), and the alliance of contractors who currently 
have collective bargaining agreements with Local 175, the New York Independent Contractors Alliance Inc. (""NYICA""). Con Ed's 
alleged co-conspirators are a rival union, Local 1010 of the Laborers International Union of North America (""Local 1010"") and 
LIUNA itself (""LIUNA""). The Complaint alleges that the beneficiaries of the unlawful agreements are unions affiliated with the 
Building & Construction Trades Council of Greater New York (the ""BCTC""), such as Local 1010. "
2024,2," The Provision reads: With respect to work ordered for Con Edison, unless otherwise agreed to by Con Edison, Contractor shall employ on Work 
at the construction site only union labor from building trades locals (affiliated with the Building & Construction Trades 
Council of Greater New York) having jurisdiction over the Work to the extent such labor is available. Id."
2024,3," The Court takes no position on the likelihood of labor strife. The Court takes judicial notice, as it is permitted to do under 
Federal Rule of Evidence 201, that in 2016, Local 175's Business Manager, Roland Bedwell, was indicted for conspiring to extort 
money from the owner of a construction company. Indictment, United States v. Bedwell, 16-608 (E.D.N.Y. December 1, 2016)."
2024,4," The Court takes judicial notice of the NLRB's 2015 decision. It only notes the existence of the decision, and does not consider it 
for its truth. "
2025,5," In 2009, the Supreme Court reaffirmed the Twombly holding in Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 684, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 
2d 868 (2009). "
2026,6," The Court rejects Plaintiffs' contention that hearsay comments from individuals who represent Local 175 and one contractor 
affiliated with Local 175 (Complaint ¶¶ 35-39) evidence an anticompetitive agreement. "
2030,1," Trendsettah calculated prejudgment interest from the date of filing, October 14, 2014. Docket No. 283 at 3 (citing Docket No. 
1); see Am. Home Assur. Co. v. Weaver Aggregate Transp., Inc., 89 F. Supp. 3d 1294, 1310-1(M.D. Fla. 2015) (""Courts in 
this District have found it reasonable to use the date of the filing of the complaint as the date on which payment was due.""). It 
used the statutory rate set by Florida's Chief Financial Officer. Docket No. 283 at 4-5; see Fla. Stat. §§ 55.03, 687.01. From 
there it arrived at an award of $929,018.31 for October 14, 2014 through December 6, 2016 (the date Trendsettah filed the 
motion to amend). Id. at 5. Using the statutory interest rate, it then calculated a daily interest rate of $1,215.79 per day for each 
day from December 7,2016 until the day the Court entered the final judgment (December 14, 2016). Id. December 7, 2016 - 
December 14, 2016=8 days x $1215.79=$9,726.32. $9,726.32 + $929,018.31=938,744.63. "
2032,2," The Court notes a discrepancy between the total number of ""hours omitted"" (25.1) in Ex. B and the number omitted when each 
attorney's hours are added (31.5). The Court assumes that the total is an arithmetic error and applies the total for each attorney. "
2034,3," Because the Court finds that Florida law supports Trendsettah's fee award the Court does not address Trendsettah's waiver 
argument. Pl.'s Supp. Br. at 1-2. "
2035,4, The Court finds that the number and distribution of hours expended on the supplemental brief were reasonable. 
2037,5," The Court notes a discrepancy between the total number of ""hours omitted"" (25.1) in Ex. B and the number omitted when each

Inc.; Monterey Mushrooms, Inc.; John Pia; and Michael Pia. See Dkt. No. 513 (Mot.) at 3; Dkt. No. 513 (Mem.) at 13."
2070,4," As has been the case in this litigation on more than one occasion, in considering certain defendants' motion, the Court has 
been required to follow the thread of the parties' arguments through a winding maze of briefs and also to set aside arguments 
which have been rendered moot by the Court's intervening decisions. A group of defendants first sought summary judgment with 
respect to plaintiffs' claims against John Pia in a July 1, 2008 motion for partial summary judgment. Dkt. No. 245. On March 26, 
2009, I denied their request for summary judgment with respect to plaintiffs' claims against John Pia without prejudice to refilling 
a subsequent motion. Dkt. No. 294 at 25; see also id. at 9 n.6 (""[R]esolution at this stage would be premature. While some of the 
discovery may have allowed for plaintiffs to discover facts relating to defendants' individualized arguments, the nature of the 
Capper-Volstead exemption did not require plaintiffs to do so at this stage and I find sufficient their Rule 56(f) affidavit stating 
that that discovery on such issues is still necessary.""). Certain defendants then sought summary judgment on John Pia's behalf 
for a second time on January 6, 2014 in their motion for partial summary judgment and reconsideration of the Court's March 26, 
2009 Opinion. Dkt. No. 513. In their opposition to that motion, plaintiffs did not specifically respond to certain defendants' 
arguments with respect to plaintiffs' claims against John Pia. See Dkt. No. 534. Then, in response to the Court's Order of 
October 14, 2014 which directed plaintiffs' to file a response, Dkt. No. 610, plaintiffs filed a specific opposition to certain 
defendants' renewed motion for partial summary judgment with respect to their claims against John Pia on November 12, 2014. 
Dkt. No. 612. Certain defendants filed a reply on December 8, 2014. Dkt. No. 615. Plaintiffs' sur-reply, Dkt. No. 650, and John 
Pia's sur-reply, Dkt. No. 652, then followed."
2070,5," The factual background of this litigation is set forth in detail in the Court's prior decisions and is discussed in this memorandum 
only to the extent necessary to explain the Court's decision "
2071,6," Although they cite no evidence in their brief to support the characterization, certain defendants refer to Thomas as ""a 
disgruntled partner of John Pia."" Dkt. No. 615 at ECF p. 6 (emphasis added). However, the record in this case reveals that 
Thomas was once a fifty percent owner of South Mill Distribution, which was ""an umbrella organization"" for mushroom 
distributorships in Dallas, Atlanta and New Orleans. Dkt. No. 273, Ex. 11 (Thomas Dep.) at 14:22-24. Pia and his brother 
Michael Pia also held ownership interests in the distribution entities. Id. at 11:7-12:17, 13:15-14:17. Asked how, in the end, he 
had gone ""from [being] a 50 percent owner to not being an owner of South Mill Distribution,"" Thomas answered, ""[t]hrough a lot 
of litigation. There was numerous lawsuits. I was sued by . . . my partners . . . [t]he Pias."" Id. at 15:10-18. He testified that the 
litigation ultimately was settled and that under the settlement he ""gave the ownership 100 percent to the Pias."" Id. at 16:6-12. "
2072,7," In relevant part, I found the EMMC did not qualify as an exempt agricultural cooperative under Capper-Volstead because one 
member, M. Cutone Mushroom Co., Inc., was not technically a grower of agricultural produce. In re Mushroom, 621 F. Supp. 2d 
at 286. This ruling still stands. In 2011, defendants asked the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit to review this Court's initial 
Capper-Volstead determination, but the Court of Appeals held that ""a district court order denying a defendant [the Capper-
Volstead Act's] protections is not effectively unreviewable after final judgment, and, therefore, is not a collateral order subject to 
interlocutory review."" In re Mushroom, 655 F.3d 158, 167 (3d Cir. 2011). A number of defendants subsequently sought 
reconsideration of my 2009 decision. See Dkt. No. 513. I denied their request for reconsideration and certified my Order for 
appeal. In re Mushroom Direct Purchaser Antitrust Litig., 54 F. Supp. 3d 382, 384 (E.D. Pa. 2014). The Court of Appeals then 
denied defendants' requests for permission to appeal from this Court's 2014 decision seeking reconsideration of my Capper-
Volstead finding. Dkt. No. 614."
2072,8," In my Opinion denying defendants' motion for reconsideration of my Capper-Volstead decision, I noted that counsel for the 
EMMC had not told defendants that Capper-Volstead removed all restrictions from their proposed conduct, but rather, instructed 
its members that any anticompetitive conduct might be protected under Capper-Volstead only if certain conditions were met. See 
In re Mushroom Direct Purchaser Antitrust Litig., 54 F. Supp. 3d 382, 392 n.15 (E.D. Pa. 2014). I wrote that defendants were instructed by their counsel that members of the EMMC must be ""producers"", i.e. mushroom growers and 
farmers and were advised that the Capper-Volstead Act affords only a limited exception and does not provide a blanket 
immunity from antitrust law. . . . Counsel also advised defendants that there is no protection offered by . . . Capper-
Volstead if the potentially § 1 offending ""agreement"" is entered into with a non-member and there is also no protection if the 
activity engaged in under [*19]  Capper-Volstead § 1 shield otherwise violates the complex law under § 2 of the Sherman 
Act . . . . Id. (internal quotations and citations omitted); see also Dkt. No. 513, Ex. I at 3 (January 23, 2001 letter to Pia) (concluding that 
""the EMMC must, going forward, continue to comply with Capper-Volstead's other requirements and must also not overstep its "
2073,," bounds under antitrust law on issues such as price discrimination, predatory pricing, agreements with competitors and 
outsiders, boycotts and attempted or actual monopolization, etc."")."
2073,9," When certain defendants first sought summary judgment on Pia's behalf, they rested their argument, in part, on the ground 
that, as an officer of an EMMC member, he lacked the capacity to conspire pursuant to Copperweld Corp. v. Independence 
Tube Corp., 467 U.S. 752, 769, 104 S. Ct. 2731, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628 (1984). See Dkt. No. 245 at 77 (citing Copperweld and 
arguing that ""[i]t is well settled that 'officers or employees of the same firm do not have the plurality of actors required for a § 1 
conspiracy""); see also Dkt. No. 513 (Mem.) at 10 (""Nor can there be any doubt that the downstream distribution Defendants 
(including the Southmill Distributors and Manfredini Enterprises) are to be viewed as single entities with their downstream 
distributors Kaolin and LRP-M under the Copperweld Doctrine . . . .""). Following my decisions that Copperweld does not 
immunize the EMMC or its members from antitrust liability, see In re Mushroom, 621 F. Supp. 2d at 291; In re Mushroom, 54 F. 
Supp. 3d at 389, defendants no longer rely on the case in their reply or sur-reply. Dkt. No. 615; Dkt. No. 652. Accordingly, I do 
not revisit the case in this opinion. "
2075,10," Also, after the parties briefed the present motion, I entered an order finding that the rule of reason is the appropriate mode of 
antitrust analysis for plaintiffs' price-fixing claim, while plaintiffs' supply control claim is subject to per se liability. See Dkt. Nos. 
670 and 671. So even if the Court of Appeals were to follow Murphy and restrict individual antitrust liability to per se claims, 
plaintiffs' supply control claims against Pia would remain."
2075,11," See also Six W. Retail Acquisition, Inc. v. Sony Theatre Mgmt. Corp., No. 97-5499, 2000 WL 264295, at *35 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 9,

she participated in the unlawful acts, or where he or she acquiesced or ratified the actions of other officers or agents of the 
corporation who violated the antitrust laws."") (citation omitted); .Cont'l Ortho. Appliances, Inc. v. Health Ins. Plan, 994 F. Supp. 
133, 142 (E.D. N.Y. 1998) (finding on a motion to dismiss that the plaintiffs had sufficiently alleged antitrust claims against the 
individual defendants where the complaint alleged ""that the individual defendants held meetings at various times at which they

conspiracy . . ."")."

2084,1," Although not relevant to this appeal, plaintiffs also asserted a claim for tortious interference arising under state law."
2084,2," Because the University is not a party to this case, we need not address whether it is entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity. 
See Maliandi v. Montclair State Univ., 845 F.3d 77, 85 (3d Cir. 2016) (""[E]ach state university exists in a unique governmental 
context, and each must be considered on the basis of its own peculiar circumstances . . . ."" (citation omitted)); Skehan v. State 
Sys. of Higher Educ., 815 F.2d 244, 249 (3d Cir. 1987) (holding that PASSHE was entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity)."
2084,3," At the time plaintiffs filed suit, the University's president was Julie E. Wollman, Ph.D. Dr. Wollman's successor and the current 
president of the University is H. Fred Walker, Ph.D. "
2086,4," HN6[
] Antitrust injury means ""(1) injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and (2) that flows from that 
which makes defendants' acts unlawful."" Bedell, 263 F.3d at 247 (quoting Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 U.S. 
477, 489, 97 S. Ct. 690, 50 L. Ed. 2d 701 (1997)). "
2087,5," Bedell's discussion of Parker is arguably dicta because it resolved the appeal based on a different doctrine, and then went on 
to conclude that Parker immunity would not have resolved the appeal. 263 F.3d at 254. A subsequent decision of this Court, 
Mariana v. Fisher, noted as much, but concluded that Bedell is binding. 338 F.3d 189, 201-04 (3d Cir. 2003). That section of 
Mariana, however, was also arguably dicta for the same reason. Regardless, we are persuaded by Mariana's embrace of Bedell 
as binding circuit precedent."
2087,6," Our analysis focuses on the University even though it was not named as a defendant in this case. Preliminarily, the University 
is a party in interest based on the official-capacity claim against its president. See Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. 159, 166, 105 
S. Ct. 3099, 87 L. Ed. 2d 114 (1985). But even if plaintiffs had only sued the Foundation, ""the same test should apply to 
determine state action immunity regardless of who the named defendants are."" Zimomra, 111 F.3d at 1500. "
2088,7," Contrast Goldfarb with the Supreme Court's subsequent decision in Bates v. State Bar of Arizona, 433 U.S. 350, 97 S. Ct. 
2691, 53 L. Ed. 2d 810 (1977). There, the Supreme Court found a state bar immune under Parker, but only after conducting 
what would later come to be known as Midcal analysis: the challenged restraint of trade was the ""affirmative command of the 
Arizona Supreme Court,"" id. at 359, and was ""subject to pointed re-examination"" by that court, id. at 362; see also Hoover, 466 
U.S. at 573 (""[T]he court itself approved the particular grading formula and retained the sole authority to determine who should 
be admitted to the practice of law in Arizona.""). "
2089,8," Defendants argue that Dental Examiners is limited to its factual context—where a regulatory entity is controlled by private 
market participants. But that control was not relevant to the Court's holding that the Board was nonsovereign. See Dental 
Exam'rs, 135 S. Ct. at 1110-11. That antecedent question was resolved simply by the Board's status as an agency, as conceded 
by counsel for the Board. Id.; see Brief for Petitioner at 24-25, Dental Exam'rs, 135 S. Ct. 1101, 191 L. Ed. 2d 35 (No. 13-534), 
2014 WL 2212529. Rather, the control by market participants was relevant to the next step of the analysis—determining whether 
the Board's actions, as a nonsovereign, are required to meet both Midcal prongs or only one. See Dental Exam'rs, 135 S. Ct. at 
1113-14."
2089,9," The District Court's reasoning equates the phrase ""traditional sovereign powers,"" Bedell, 263 F.3d at 258, with the phrase 
""traditional area of state power,"" Edinboro, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 178191, 2016 WL 6883295, at *3. While providing for higher 
education is certainly a traditional state function, it does not follow that the University wields traditional sovereign power. 
Likewise, in Dental Examiners, professional licensing and regulation is a traditional area of state power. Yet that was no obstacle 
to the Supreme Court concluding that the Board was a nonsovereign actor. Cf. Dental Exam'rs, 135 S. Ct. at 1119 (Alito, J., 
dissenting) (""[T]he regulation of the practice of medicine and dentistry was regarded as falling squarely within the States' 
sovereign police power.""). "
2091,10," We need not, therefore, address defendants' argument that we should affirm on the alternative ground of Noerr-Pennington 
immunity. "
2092,11," Plaintiffs aver that the University expanded its rule ""purely for financial reasons, specifically to ensure occupancy levels in on-
campus 'affiliated' housing generate sufficient revenue to service the $100-plus million bond debt incurred by the Foundation to 
develop the Highlands Project."" Am. Compl. ¶ 46. These allegations do not alter our analysis. The Supreme Court has 
""consistently sought to avoid"" any ""deconstruction"" or ""probing of the official 'intent.'"" Omni, 499 U.S. at 377. Nor are we influenced by plaintiffs' allegation that the University acted ultra vires by failing to engage in a competitive bidding 
process, 24 P.S. § 20-2003-A.1(c.2), or by failing to fulfill its mandate ""to provide high quality education at the lowest possible 
cost for students,"" id. § 20-2003-A(a). Parker analysis does not ""dictate[] transformation of state administrative review into a 
federal antitrust job."" Omni, 499 U.S. at 372 (quoting 1 Philip E. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law ¶ 212.3b, at 145 
(Supp. 1989)). "
2093,12," Finally, plaintiffs argue that we should recognize a so-called market-participant exception to Parker immunity. The Supreme 
Court, as well as this Court, have discussed such an exception in dicta. See Phoebe Putney, 133 S. Ct. at 1011 n.4; Omni, 499 
U.S. at 379; Bedell, 263 F.3d at 265 n.55. The existence of such an exception is not clearly established. See, e.g., VIBO Corp. v. 
Conway, 669 F.3d 675, 686-87 (6th Cir. 2012); Hedgecock v. Blackwell Land Co., 52 F.3d 333, [published in full-text format at 
1995 U.S. App. LEXIS 8027], 1995 WL 161649 (9th Cir. 1995) (table opinion); Genentech, Inc. v. Eli Lilly & Co., 998 F.2d 931, 
949 (Fed. Cir. 1993) abrogated on other grounds by Wilton v. Seven Falls Co., 515 U.S. 277, 115 S. Ct. 2137, 132 L. Ed. 2d 214 
(1995); Paragould Cablevision, Inc. v. City of Paragould, 930 F.2d 1310, 1313 (8th Cir. 1991) (""[T]he market participant 
exception is merely a suggestion and is not a rule of law.""). We need not resolve this issue here. And even assuming that such an exception exists, it would not apply to this case. A market-
participant exception would only apply where ""[t]he government entity . . . was involved in the market as a buyer or seller."" 
Bedell, 263 F.3d at 265 n.55 (citing Union P. R. Co. v. United States, 313 U.S. 450, 61 S. Ct. 1064, 85 L. Ed. 1453 (1941)). 
While the University leased certain property to the Foundation, the Complaint only alleges that the Foundation's [**28]  
transactions in the student-housing market are part of an anticompetitive scheme. Applying a market-participant exception to 
these circumstances would swallow the rule that ""the state does not forfeit Parker immunity simply because it acts with a private 
party."" Id. "
