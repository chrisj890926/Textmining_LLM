23,1," The Court provided this Memorandum Opinion to the parties in final form on January 8, 2014. Public release was delayed to 
ensure that no confidential information was disclosed. The Court separately issued an order granting various third parties' 
motions to seal their documents used as trial exhibits. Based on the motions to seal and input from the parties, confidential 
information has been redacted from this opinion, reflected by the insertion of black boxes covering the redacted text."
23,2," Section 7 of the Clayton Act states, in relevant part: No person engaged in commerce or in any activity affecting commerce shall acquire, directly or indirectly, the whole or any part 
of the stock or other share capital and no person subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission shall acquire the 
whole or any part of the assets of another person engaged also in commerce or in any activity affecting commerce, where in any 
line of commerce or in any activity affecting commerce in any section of the country, the effect of such acquisition may be 
substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly. 15 U.S.C. § 18. "
24,3," The Court takes ""table stakes,"" in this context, to mean an offering companies must provide to effectively sell product over the 
internet. "
26,4," Witnesses Stephen Collins (Bazaarvoice's CEO and member of the Board of Directors), Brett Hurt (Bazaarvoice's co-founder 
and former CEO and current Vice-Chairman  [*15] of the Board of Directors), Thomas Meredith (Chairman of Bazaarvoice's 
Board), Brant Barton (Bazaarvoice's co-founder), Michael Osborne (Bazaarvoice's former Chief Revenue Officer), and Kenneth 
Comée (PowerReviews's former CEO) all own a substantial amount of Bazaarvoice stock and are financially interested in the 
outcome of this case. Collins, Hurt, and Meredith have also been sued in their personal capacity in a private lawsuit in Texas 
state court alleging that they knew that the acquisition would lessen competition and create a monopoly, and failed to disclose 
the anticompetitive nature of the acquisition. Third-party witness Christian Friedland of Build.com is an investor in Austin 
Ventures, one of Bazaarvoice's largest shareholders."
26,5," The Court uses abbreviations ""GX"" and ""DX"" to refer to the government's trial exhibits and Bazaarvoice's trial exhibits, 
respectively. ""Trial Tr."" refers to  [*19] trial testimony. ""Dep."" refers to pre-trial deposition testimony. ""PFF"" refers to the "
27,," government's post-trial plaintiff's proposed findings of fact. Dkt. No. 235. ""DFF"" refers to Bazaarvoice post-trial proposed findings 
of fact. Dkt. No. 239. "
35,6," In contrast, the ""Red Ocean""  [*74] refers to blood in the water caused by extensive head-to-head competition. "
39,7," Another copy of this document, GX1148, was also used during the trial. "
40,8," Following the acquisition, Bazaarvoice acquired Longboard Media in 2012. Longboard Media is an advertising network that 
allows brand advertisers to buy advertising inventory on large retail sites where they can influence purchase decisions of 
shoppers who are on those retail sites. Trial Tr. 656:17-657:6. "
42,9," The 2010 HORIZONTAL  [*112] MERGER GUIDELINES will be referred to as MERGER GUIDELINES. Prior MERGER GUIDELINES will be 
referred to with their year of publication, e.g., MERGER GUIDELINES (2003). "
53,10," Dr. Shapiro's initial market share calculations based on customer revenues contained numerous mistakes which required 
correction. These adjustments resulted in about a one percent adjustment to PowerReviews' market share and about a two 
percent adjustment to Bazaarvoice's market share. Trial Tr. 965:6-23 (Shapiro); compare GX1077 with GX1063. "
54,11," It is worth noting that, based on Dr. Shapiro's raw count of which vendors provide R&R to IR500 companies—underlying 
figures which Bazaarvoice does not dispute—Bazaarvoice  [*220] and PowerReviews combined provide R&R to 57 per cent of 
all IR500 companies, including those that do not have R&R. All other providers combined provide R&R to fewer than 4 per cent 
of IR500 companies. Approximately 25 per cent of IR500 companies have an in-house R&R solution. GX985*. Accordingly, even 
when including companies that do not provide R&R, the basic market structure is the same: Bazaarvoice and PowerReviews are 
the two dominant providers of R&R and no other provider comes close to their share of the market. "
55,12," Rating-System's 78 paying customers are primarily credit card swipe customers who pay very low fees for basic R&R, like the 
PowerReviews Express customers. Rating-System's customers are not enterprise customers and Rating-System will not 
constrain Bazaarvoice's pricing of R&R. Trial Tr. 979:2-12 (Shapiro). "
57,13," As discussed more fully in the Order on Evidentiary Objections, the Court determined that Mr. Goldberg had sufficient 
qualifications to testify generally about the overall eCommerce industry but lacked sufficient expertise to provide opinions about 
the R&R market or central issues in this case. His reports and opinions were deficient in several ways outlined in that 
 [*221] Order. "
58,14," In this context, the Court understands that PowerReviews used ""brands"" to refer to both retailers and manufacturers. "
62,15," The parties' pre-trial Stipulation arguably provided for admission of the Yotpo declaration in evidence. As discussed more fully 
in the Order on Evidentiary Objections, the Court admits the declaration over the government's objection, but assigns it very little 
weight. "
64,16," Bazaarvoice offered Exhibit 3a to Dr. Shehadeh's rebuttal report to argue that the adoption of in-house platforms has 
increased substantially. This exhibit was based on an error Dr. Shapiro initially made concerning Amazon months before that 
materially over-stated the market in a way that supported Bazaarvoice's argument. Dr. Shehadeh was well aware of that error, 
which had been corrected prior to trial, but inexplicably used it at trial anyway. His justification, that he was merely using Dr. 
Shapiro's work to make his point, fell flat. Trial Tr. 1927:22-1928:2 (Shehadeh). "
85,17," As the United States District Court for the District of Columbia noted, ""[s]ome commentators have criticized this [Oracle] 
standard, however, because impermissible price increases can be achieved on far lower market shares than Oracle's standard 
evidently requires."" H & R Block, Inc., 833 F. Supp. 2d at 84 (internal punctuation omitted) (citing Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert 
Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law, 914 at 84 (3d ed. 2007). The H & R Block court ""decline[d] the defendants' invitation,  [*234] in 
reliance on Oracle, to impose a market share threshold for proving a unilateral effects claim."" H & R Block, 833 F. Supp. 2d at 
85. "
86,18," The MERGER GUIDELINES are not binding on the courts, but they ""are often used as persuasive authority when deciding if a 
particular acquisition violates anti-trust laws."" Chicago Bridge, 534 F.3d at 432; see also United States v. Kinder, 64 F.3d 757, 
771 & n.22 (2d Cir. 1995) (Leval, J., dissenting) (""Although it is widely acknowledged that the MERGER GUIDELINES do not bind the 
judiciary in determining whether to sanction a corporate merger or acquisition for anticompetitive effect, courts commonly cite 
them as a benchmark of legality."") (listing cases). "
87,19," Bazaarvoice asserts that the ""consensus view"" is that two years is the proper ""time frame for entry and competitive effects 
analysis."" Bazaarvoice Post-Trial Brief at 18. Dr. Shapiro and Dr. Shehadeh likewise stated that the time frame is around two 
years. Tr. 2035:20-22 (Shehadeh) (""So I would think that if we don't see effects in the next two years, then we don't need to 
worry about effects farther out in the future.""); Tr. 1023:25-1025:2 (Shapiro) (""So the time frame for entry, I'm thinking about a 
year or two, and these entry barriers are just not easy to surmount.""). The MERGER GUIDELINES state that  [*242] entry is timely if 
it is ""rapid enough to make unprofitable overall the actions causing those effects and thus leading to entry, even though those 
actions would be profitable until entry takes effect."" MERGER GUIDELINES § 9.1. The Court agrees that two years is an appropriate 
time-frame in this case. Entry within two years is likely to undo the anticompetitive effects created by the merger such that the 
merger would be unprofitable, whereas entry beyond two years is not. "
88,20," The complete quotation from Baker Hughes reads: ""Furthermore, the supposed 'quick and effective' entry requirement 
overlooks the point that a firm that never enters a given market can nevertheless exert competitive pressure on that market. If 
barriers to entry are insignificant, the threat of entry can stimulate  [*247] competition in a concentrated market, regardless of 
whether entry ever occurs."" Baker Hughes, 908 F.2d at 988 (emphasis added). "
89,21," As stated in more detail below, post-merger evidence of actual entry is less susceptible to manipulation by the parties than 
other types of post-merger evidence, such as lack of price increases or continued innovation, and is therefore more probative. "
91,22," Merging entities smaller than the reporting thresholds are not required to provide pre-merger notifications. That was the case 
here. "
96,1," Plaintiff excludes the following people from his definition of the class: Plaintiff's counsel; Defendant's employees; the Court and 
the immediate family members and staff of the Court. "
98,2," To the extent Defendant challenges Mr. Healy as a class representative based on the time frame of his membership in the 
class, that issue will be addressed below. "
99,3," ""In a class action brought under Rule 23(b)(3), the 'commonality' requirement of Rule 23(a)(2) is 'subsumed under, or 
superseded by, the more stringent Rule 23(b)(3) requirement that questions common to the class predominate over' other 
questions."" Lienhart v. Dryvit Sys., Inc., 255 F.3d 138, 146 n.4 (4th Cir. 2001) (quoting Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor, 521 
U.S. 591, 609, 117 S. Ct. 2231, 138 L. Ed. 2d 689 (1997)). The Rule 23(b)(3) predominance requirement is ""far more 
demanding"" than Rule 23(a)(2)'s commonality requirement. Amchem Prods., 521 U.S. at 624. "
103,4," Chase Parkway Garage, Inc. v. Subaru of New England, Inc., 94 F.R.D. 330, 331 (D. Mass. 1982)  [*30] (agreeing with the 
Third Circuit's analysis in Bogosian v. Gulf Oil Corp., 561 F.2d 434 (3d Cir. 1977), ""that proof of coercion on an individual basis 
was not required where a seller expressly conditioned the sale of one product upon the purchase of another""); Ungar, 531 F.2d 
at 1222, 1226 & n.17 (""With regard to the doctrine of individual coercion we believe it is open to us to reject it, as the district 
court did, or to accept it. Having in mind the particular factual complex before us, we choose the latter course. . . . Where, as 
here, plaintiff franchisees place no reliance on express contractual tie-ins, each, individually, must prove that his purchases were 
coerced as an element of establishing a prima facie case of illegal tying.""). "
107,1," After briefs had been filed on these appeals, respondent Cooper-Booth Wholesale Company filed a petition for bankruptcy in 
federal court, and we dismissed the appeal as to Cooper-Booth only."
107,2," The record on appeal does not show clearly whether these listed defendants were served with a notice of appeal and should be 
designated as respondents. Some defendants entered into settlements with plaintiff. Others may still be active parties. "
115,3," As we understand it, subjobbers buy cigarettes from licensed wholesalers and resell them to retailers, generally those with a 
lower volume of cigarette sales. See Eby-Brown Co. v. Wis. Dep't of Agric., 213 F. Supp. 2d 993, 997 (W.D.Wis.2001), aff'd, 295 
F.3d 749 (7th Cir.2002). New Jersey imposes even fewer administrative barriers on subjobbers than on stamping wholesalers. 
Stamping indicates payment of cigarette taxes."
115,4," N.J.S.A. 56:7-22(b) states: HN2[
] [T]he ""cost of doing business by the wholesaler"" shall be presumed to be 5.25% of the ""basic cost of cigarettes"" to 
the wholesaler, plus cartage to the retail outlet, if performed or paid for by the wholesaler, which cartage cost, in the 
absence of the filing with the director of satisfactory proof of a lesser or higher cost, shall be deemed to be 3/4 of 1% of the 
""basic cost of cigarettes"" to the wholesaler. "
116,," N.J.A.C. 18:6-1.1, HN3[
] lists the types of expenses  [***7] that shall be considered in determining a wholesaler's cost of doing 
business but also states that the cost will be presumed to be the percentages as quoted above in the statute, ""[i]n the absence 
of the filing with the Director of satisfactory proof of a lesser or higher cost of doing business."" "
120,5," HN17[
] In Brooke Group, supra, 509 U.S. at 224, 113 S. Ct. at 2588,125 L. Ed. 2d at 187, the United States Supreme Court explained the concept of predatory intent in antitrust cases: The second prerequisite to holding a competitor liable under the antitrust laws for charging low prices is a demonstration 
that the competitor had a reasonable prospect, or, under § 2 of the Sherman Act, a dangerous probability, of recouping its 
investment in below-cost prices. For the investment to be rational, the [predator] must have a reasonable expectation of 
recovering, in the form of later monopoly profits, more than the losses suffered. Recoupment is the ultimate object of an 
unlawful predatory pricing scheme; it is the means by which a predator profits from predation. Without it, predatory pricing 
produces lower aggregate prices in the market, and consumer welfare is enhanced. [(Citations and internal quotation marks omitted. Alteration in original.)]. "
122,6," ""Loss-leader"" refers to ""[t]he selling of selected goods at a loss in order to lure customers into the store."" Safeway Stores, Inc. 
v. Oklahoma Retail Grocers Asso., 360 U.S. 334, 340, 79 S. Ct. 1196, 1201, 3 L. Ed. 2d 1280, 1285 (1959). "
123,7," In this civil case, we are not addressing N.J.S.A. 56:7-20(c), which HN23[
] provides that a violation of the Act is a disorderly 
person offense as to which a fine of up to $1,000 may be imposed. We make no determination that a defendant would have any 
burden of proof in defending against a disorderly persons charge. See Twin City Candy, supra, 149 N.W.2d at 705-06. "
124,8," Both sides on this appeal address the Southland trial court's written opinion in the context of the predatory intent issue. 
Because that opinion was unpublished, it does not constitute precedent and is not subject to formal citation. R. 1:36-3."
124,9," Bernstein argues as an alternative ground for affirmance that plaintiff's claims should be dismissed for failure to comply with 
Rule 4:5-1. We find insufficient merit in the argument to warrant discussion in a written opinion. R. 2:11-3(e)(1)(E). "
127,*," The Honorable James G. Carr, Senior United States District Judge for the Northern District of Ohio, sitting by designation. "
128,1, The Policy defines bolded terms elsewhere in the document. 
130,2," Federal does not argue that this court should look at the clause ""any amount reimbursed by any Insured Person"" (R. 11-2 
PAGE ID 244) in making its decision. As the district court correctly held, under the terms of the Policy, an insured person 
encompasses only individuals, not companies. R. 46 PAGE ID 2327 n.9. "
131,3," Other courts have distinguished Level 3 on  [**14] this ground. See Genzyme Corp. v. Fed. Ins. Co., 622 F.3d 62,70 (1st Cir. 
2010) (holding that defendant ""obtained no identifiable asset"" and ""therefore the [underlying] settlement payment cannot 
represent the restoration to the plaintiffs of some amount [the defendant] had improperly taken and withheld""); Virginia Mason 
Med. Ctr. v. Exec. Risk Indem., Inc., 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 85724, 2007 WL 3473683, *3 (W.D. Wash. Nov. 14, 2007) (holding 
that the underlying suit ""did not seek to prevent unjust enrichment or to deprive [defendant] of the 'net benefit' of its allegedly 
wrongful act"" but rather the underlying settlement ""was calculated by determining the individual harm suffered by each plaintiff""), 
aff'd, 331 F. App'x 473 (9th Cir. 2009). "
133,4," Under ""rule of reason"" approach, a court must ""engage in a thorough analysis of the relevant market and the effects of the 
restraint in that market.""  [**21] Realcomp II, Ltd. v. Fed. Trade Comm'n, 635 F.3d 815, 825 (6th Cir. 2011). "
144,1," Where convenient, the Court uses the nomenclature of the complaints to refer to subsets of the eighteen named defendants, 
who are: (1) LG Chem, Ltd., and (2) LG Chem America, Inc. (collectively, ""LG"" or ""LG Chem"");  [*33] (3) Samsung SDI Co., Ltd., 
and (4) Samsung SDI America, Inc. (collectively, ""Samsung""); (5) Panasonic Corp. and (6) Panasonic Corp. of North America 
(collectively, ""Panasonic""); (7) Sanyo Electric Co., Ltd., and (8) Sanyo North America Corp. (collectively, ""Sanyo""); (9) Sony 
Corp., (10) Sony Energy Devices Corp., and (11) Sony Electronics, Inc. (collectively, ""Sony""); (12) Hitachi Maxell, Ltd., and (13) 
Maxell Corp. of America (collectively, ""Hitachi""); (14) GS Yuasa Corp. (""GS Yuasa""); (15) NEC Corp. and (16) NEC Tokin 
(collectively ""NEC""); and (17) Toshiba Corp. and (18) Toshiba America Electronic Components, Inc. (collectively, ""Toshiba""). The 
Court also follows the complaints in occasionally referring to LG and Samsung collectively as the ""Korean Defendants,"" and the 
remaining defendants collectively as the ""Japanese Defendants."" "
145,2," Neither GS Yuasa nor NEC join either motion. GS Yuasa does not appear to have been served. NEC waived service and the 
parties have stipulated to a later date for NEC to respond. (Dkt. No. 349.) For convenience, the Court refers to the jointly moving 
defendants as simply ""Defendants."""
145,3," Panasonic and Sanyo share counsel and have filed a single motion to dismiss addressing issues particular to Panasonic Corp. 
of North America and Sanyo North America Corp. "
146,4," Unless context requires a distinction, the Court refers interchangeably to batteries, battery packs, and another industry term for 
batteries, ""modules."""
146,5," Whereas cylindrical and prismatic batteries use a liquid or gel electrolyte, in polymer batteries the electrolyte is a solid, which 
allegedly confers benefits ""in terms of fabrication and ruggedness."" (IPP-CAC ¶ 33.) "
148,6," The minute order for the December 6, 2013 hearing inaccurately reflects that the Court ordered only Sony and Panasonic to 
produce. (Dkt. No. 337.) The inaccuracy apparently stems from the fact that Panasonic and Sanyo share counsel. "
150,7," Interim lead counsel for the DPPs clarified at oral argument their theory that batteries sold under a defendant's own name are 
properly part of the DPP case, while batteries and packs sold under  [*55] a packer's name come within the ambit of the IPP 
case. The bases for this distinction are not obvious and should be clarified in the DPPs' next iteration of their complaint. "
151,8," The DPPs need not establish each and every link in the chain of standing for pleading purposes, but they do need to allege 
specific facts which, aided  [*58] by reasonable inferences, allow the Court to draw a plausible conclusion that these named 
DPPs have suffered an antitrust injury traceable to these Defendants."
151,9," At least two other judges in this District, confronted with the same question, have come to the same conclusion. (Reply ISO 
Joint MTD DPP-CAC at 3-4 (citing In re Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) Antitrust Litig., 911 F. Supp. 2d 857, 870 (N.D. Cal. 2012) "
152,," motion to certify appeal denied, 07-5944 SC, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20932, 2013 WL 567281 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 13, 2013) (Conti, 
J.) (""CRT II"") & TFT-LCD VII, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 166194, 2012 WL 5869588 (Illston, J.).)"
152,10," Because the Court dismisses for failure to allege standing under Illinois Brick and its progeny, the Court need not and does not 
reach the issue of whether Associated General Contractors of California, Inc. v. California State Council of Carpenters, 459 U.S. 
519, 103 S. Ct. 897, 74 L. Ed. 2d 723 (1983) (""AGC""), also compels dismissal. The Court notes that it did not grant Defendants 
leave to brief the issue of AGC standing, which supplies a separate, independent ground not to reach it. "
155,11," To select a single representative example, both complaints allege the existence of an internal LG document summarizing 
meetings between LG and Sony on March 2-3, 2004. (IPP-CAC ¶ 67; DPP-CAC ¶ 106.) The document allegedly memorializes 
conversations in which LG and Sony executives discussed Sony's desire to raise prices on lithium ion batteries, solicited 
agreement from its competitors to join in the price hikes, and apparently received from them commitments of ""cooperation."""
155,12," By alleging a conspiracy to raise the prices of all three formats of battery cell, the IPP-CAC and DPP-CAC,  [*74] for pleading 
purposes, implicate all the lithium ion battery products alleged. Given the high degree of standardization among battery cell 
formats and types, the Court perceives no reason to distinguish among consumer products at the pleading stage. The 
conspiracy alleged here fixed the prices of battery cells of all three formats, and those cells allegedly made their way into all 
manner of lithium ion battery products. For example, the complaints allege a conspiracy to fix the prices of cylindrical battery 
cells, without distinguishing whether the cylindrical battery cells are destined for use in, on the one hand, notebook computers, or 
on the other, digital cameras. In challenging the pleadings on a product-by-product basis rather than format-by-format basis, 
Defendants impose a layer of granularity not supported by the pleadings themselves. "
156,13," Both the IPPs and DPPs suggest that, once the existence of a conspiracy is established—or, here, alleged—only a ""slight 
connection"" is required to establish a particular defendant's participation. (Dkt. No. 307 (""Opp'n to Joint MTD IPP-CAC"") at 8; 
Opp'n to Joint MTD DPP-CAC at 3-4.) The Court disagrees for two reasons. First, to the extent that Plaintiffs urge that a slight 
connection need not include a conscious decision to join the conspiracy, their position is at odds with binding precedent. E.g., 
Monsanto, 465 U.S. at 764; Toscano, 258 F.3d at 983. Second, the proffered ""slight connection"" or ""slight evidence"" rule has 
been disapproved as a standard for determining whether a defendant has joined a conspiracy in the first instance, and indeed as 
a standard applicable in district courts at all. United States v. Dunn, 564 F.2d 348, 357 n.21 (9th Cir. 1977) (""[A]fter much 
reflection we are of the mind that the slight evidence rule may be of doubtful appellate application  [*81] when the issue for 
review concerns whether the defendant was connected with the conspiracy at all."") (emphasis added); United States v. Grasso, 
724 F.3d 1077, 1096-97 (9th Cir. 2013) cert. denied, 134 S. Ct. 484, 187 L. Ed. 2d 327 (U.S. 2013) (Berzon, J., concurring in 
part, dissenting in part) (observing that slight evidence rule ""is ultimately best understood to mean that if someone joins the 
conspiracy, 'slight' activity to accomplish its objectives is enough"") (internal quotation marks omitted); see also In re Citric Acid "
157,," Litig., 996 F. Supp. 951, 955 (N.D. Cal. 1998) aff'd, 191 F.3d 1090 (9th Cir. 1999) (holding that slight evidence rule was a rule of 
criminal appellate procedure not applicable by a district court considering summary judgment because the rule would supplant 
the normal summary judgment standard)."
157,14," Hitachi requests that the Court take judicial notice of a letter between counsel which the IPPCAC purportedly quotes at 
paragraph 227. (Dkt. No. 285.) The letter plays no part in the Court's analysis of the sufficiency of the IPP-CAC, and accordingly 
Hitachi's request for judicial notice is DENIED AS MOOT. "
158,15," Defendants identify slightly different cutoff dates for each Plaintiff class: October 3, 2008 for the IPPs and October 11, 2008 for 
the DPPs."
158,16," The IPPs, in addition to asserting a single federal antitrust claim for injunctive relief (IPP-CAC ¶¶ 412-422), proceed under the 
antitrust laws of 29 individual states, some of which have statutes of limitations that differ from the four-year federal limitations 
period. The differences in limitations being irrelevant for present purposes, the Court focuses on the federal four-year period. "
166,1," In the Motion, Defendants do not challenge Plaintiffs' ability to file a derivative suit on behalf of Gree USA. "
168,2," ""It shall be unlawful for any person to . . . sell, offer for sale, distribute in commerce, or import into the United States any 
consumer product bearing a registered safety certification mark owned by an accredited conformity assessment body, which 
mark is known, or should have been known, by such person to be used in a manner unauthorized by the owner of that 
certification mark."" 15 U.S.C. § 2068(a)(12). "
170,3," Plaintiffs mistakenly cite Woodland Hills as support for the proposition that ""this issue is not appropriate for resolution on a 
motion to dismiss."" (Opp'n 13.) In Woodland Hills, the case was remanded for the trial court to ""determine the propriety of 
attorney's fees under section 1021.5 after a hearing which properly focuses on the criteria established by the statute,"" but this 
was because the trial court had erroneously held that California law barred ""private attorney general"" fee awards. Woodland 
Hills, 23 Cal. 3d at 932-33. The stage of the proceedings was not at issue. "
176,1," A transferor court refers to the court in which the suit  [*19] was begun (here, the Northern District of Illinois); the transferee 
court refers to the court to which the case was transferred for MDL pretrial rulings (the Northern District of California). "
179,2," The Ninth Circuit did not articulate what constitutes ""proximate  [*28] cause"" in the FTAIA context. Judge Noonan wrote a 
concurring opinion in which he noted that, in the law of negligence, what turns a but-for cause into a proximate cause is ""a value 
judgment that the cause in fact creates an unacceptable risk of injury to a protected interest."" DRAM, 546 F.3d at 991 (Noonan, 
J., concurring). He noted that, under that standard, ""it would seem that reasonably prudent persons in the position of the 
defendants would see that their actions setting prices in the United States would negatively affect customers in the United States 
and elsewhere."" Id. Nevertheless, Judge Noonan concurred in the judgment, reasoning: [I]t has been the judgment of Congress and the Supreme Court that the economic interests of consumers outside the 
United States are normally not something that American law is intended to protect. Hence it is difficult to persuade a court 
that injury to foreign consumers has been ""caused"" by price-fixing in the United States. . . . We reach this vanishing point 
not from guidance in words like ""proximate"" or ""direct"" but from a strong sense that the protection of consumers in another 
country is normally the business of that country. Location, not logic,  [*29] keeps [the plaintiff's] claim out of court. Id. "
180,3," The MDL court did not elaborate on what about the locale of these transactions was significant. The record facts are described 
infra p. 17."
180,4," See Defendants' Joint Motion for Summary Judgment 8-9, Motorola III (""The Foreign Assignors, not Motorola, Inc., purchased

generally do not raise competition concerns.""). But such a reading would far too greatly constrict parties' power to settle, a power 
the Actavis court clearly meant to keep intact. "
200,1," Under a professional services agreement (""PSA""), a physician practice group agrees to provide health care services 
exclusively on behalf of St. Luke's, and St. Luke's is reimbursed for the practice's services under contracts that St. Luke's enters 
into with payors. Although physicians practicing under a PSA do not have a direct employment relationship with St. Luke's, the 
PSA sets forth the compensation that St. Luke's pays the physician practice for services provided by the physicians on its behalf. 
For purposes of this case, a PSA arrangement creates a relationship functionally equivalent to employment to the extent that it 
provides, at the group level, the same clinical and financial alignment that employment provides at the individual level. 
Therefore, St. Luke's PSA-based relationships with physicians will be described and regarded as the same as ""employment"" by 
St. Luke's. "
209,2," The five specialty care clinics were (1) Boise Orthopedic Clinic, (2) Idaho Cardiothoracic and Vascular Associates, (3) Idaho 
Pulmonary Associates, (4) Intermountain Orthopedics, and (5) Idaho Cardiology [*35]  Associates. "

215,5," All plaintiffs challenge the Saltzer transaction under § 7 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 18, and the analogous Idaho state law, 
Idaho Code Ann. § 48-106. The private plaintiffs also challenge the transaction under § 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1, and 
the corresponding Idaho state law, Idaho Code Ann. § 48-104. Claims under both Clayton Act § 7 and Sherman Act § 1 are 
generally adjudicated according to the same standards. See, e.g., United States v. Rockford Mem'l Corp., 898 F.2d 1278, 1283 
(7th Cir. 1990). "
223,1," The Ninth Circuit provides that ""'[plaintiffs] should be given an opportunity through discovery to identify [] unknown defendants'"" 
""in circumstances . . . 'where the identity of the alleged defendant[] [is] not [] known prior to the filing of a complaint.'"" Wakefield 
v. Thompson, 177 F.3d 1160, 1163 (9th Cir. 1999) (quoting Gillespie v. Civiletti, 629 F.2d 637, 642 (9th Cir. 1980)) 
(modifications in the original). Plaintiff is warned, however, that such defendants will be dismissed where ""'it is clear that 
discovery would not uncover the identities, or that the complaint would be dismissed on other grounds.'"" Id. (quoting Gillespie, 
629 F.2d at 642). Plaintiff is further warned that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(m),  [*4] which states that the court must 
dismiss defendants who have not been served within 120 days after the filing of the complaint unless plaintiff shows good cause, 
is applicable to doe defendants. See Glass v. Fields, No. 1:09-cv-00098-OWW-SMS PC, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 97604 (E.D. 
Cal. Aug. 31, 2011); Hard Drive Prods. v. Does, No. C 11-01567 LB, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 109837, at *2-4 (N.D. Cal. Sep. 27, 
2011). "
229,2," Because plaintiffs conceded at hearing that the complaint has no allegations that a landlord-tenant relationship was formed 
between the parties, the court does not address plaintiffs' arguments relating to a landlord-tenant relationship on summary 
judgment. See Stations W., LLC v. Pinnacle Bank of Or., 338 F. App'x 658, 660 (9th Cir. 2009) (plaintiffs cannot use opposition 
to summary judgment as  [*26] a back door way to introduce new claims); see also Gilmour v. Gates, McDonald & Co., 382 F.3d 
1312, 1315 (11th Cir. 2004) (""A plaintiff may not amend her complaint through argument in a brief opposing summary 
judgment.""). "
235,1," This motion was determined to be suitable for decision without oral argument. E.D. Cal. L.R. 230(g). The hearing was 
scheduled for December 11, 2013. "
242,2," In the complaint, the header for the seventh cause of action provides, ""Dual Tracking in Violation of Civil Code sections 2953 
and 2954"" however the body of complaint states ""Defendants' violations under Civil Code sections 2923 and 2924 et. seq."" 
(Compl. ¶ 75). Accordingly, the Court finds that the header mistakenly lists the Sections 2953 and 2954 and the correct sections 
are Sections 2923 and 2924. "
245,1, Documents pertaining to Mr. Valenzuela's loan and property foreclosure were recorded with the Kern County Official Records.
245,2," Mr. Valenzuela proceeds on his Verified Complaint for Declaratory Judgment, Temporary Restraining Order, Injunctive Relief, 
and Monetary Damages (""complaint""). "
247,3," ""We have extended the 'incorporation by reference' doctrine to situations in which the plaintiff's claim depends on the contents 
of a document, the defendant attaches the document to its motion to dismiss, and the parties do not dispute the authenticity of 
the document, even though the plaintiff does not explicitly allege the contents of that document in the complaint."" Knievel v. 
ESPN, 393 F.3d 1068, 1076 (9th Cir. 2005) (citing Parrino, 146 F.3d at 706). "
254,4," RICO refers to the Racketeer and Corrupt Practices Act (""RICO""), 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961, et seq. "
262,5," There is no actionable duty between a lender and borrower in that loan transactions are arms-length. A lender ""owes no duty of 
care to the [borrowers] in approving their loan. Liability to a borrower for negligence arises only when the lender 'actively 
participates' in the financed enterprise 'beyond the domain of the usual money lender.'"" Wagner v. Benson, 101 Cal.App.3d 27, 
35, 161 Cal.Rptr. 516 (1980) (citing several cases). ""[A]s a general rule, a financial institution owes no duty of care to a borrower 
when the institution's involvement in the loan transaction does not exceed the scope of its conventional role as a mere lender of 
money."" Nymark v. Heart Fed. Savings & Loan Assn., 231 Cal.App.3d 1089, 1096, 283 Cal.Rptr. 53 (1991); see Meyers v. 
Guarantee Sav. & Loan Assn., 79 Cal. App. 3d 307, 312, 144 Cal. Rptr. 616 (1978) (no lender liability when lender did not 
engage ""in any activity outside the scope of the normal activities of a lender of construction monies""). "
266,1, Familiarity with the Court's Dismissal Order is presumed.
266,2," On that date, Chrysler purchased substantially all of the assets of Chrysler LLC (""Old Carco""), which had previously filed for 
Chapter 11 bankruptcy. (SAC ¶ 41.) As part of the transaction, Chrysler assumed certain warranty-related obligations of Old 
Carco, including the obligation to cover the cost of parts and labor for repairs made under vehicle warranties. (Id.)"
266,3, Otherwise undesignated paragraph references are to the SAC. 
268,4," Such allegations are still subject to the Rule 8(a) pleading requirements discussed in Twombly and Iqbal. See Tanedo v. E. 
Baton Rouge Parish Sch. Bd., SA CV10-01172 JAK, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 175009, 2012 WL 5447959, at *7-8 (C.D. Cal. Oct. 
4, 2012). "
271,5," Perhaps in the abstract Casey's status as a consumer could also be established by virtue of her expenditure at her local repair 
shop. However, in the absence of allegations that Chrysler performed the repair service or supplied the part, there is no claim 
against Chrysler. A DTPA claim requires that the defendant engaged in false, misleading, or deceptive acts, that resulted in 
damage to the plaintiff. Boys Clubs, 907 S.W.2d at 478. Here, it is alleged that Chrysler's deceptive act is  [*20] the failure to 
disclose that the ""repair"" to Plaintiffs' vehicles consisted of replacing a known defective part with a replacement part that was 
known to be identically or similarly defective. (¶ 165.) If Chrysler had no involvement in the repair at Casey's local repair shop, 
they cannot be held liable for a failure to disclose how the ""repair"" would be effectuated. "
273,6," The present case is also distinguishable from the facts in Inman, 252 S.W.3d at 300-01. There, in a putative class of ten million 
owners of vehicles with seatbelt buckles they contended were too easily unlatched, the Texas Supreme Court dismissed the 
claims of three plaintiffs who failed to allege they experienced inadvertent unlatching of those seatbelts. Id. at 300-01. Here, 
there is not a complete absence of manifestation of the defect as  [*27] there was in Inman."
273,7," Otherwise undesignated statutory citations in this section are to the Maryland Code, Title 13, Commercial Law. "
275,8," Arguably, any communications between Chrysler and Plaintiffs are ""promot[ions]"" of repair services with a material omission. 
(See, e.g., SAC Ex. 1.)"
275,9," The CPA's definition of ""unfair or deceptive trade practices"" expressly incorporates  [*33] the definition of a similar term used in 
the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. 45(a)(1), and requires that ""due consideration and weight be given"" to the term's 
interpretation as expressed by the Federal Trade Commission and federal case law. § 13-105; see also 15 USC § 45(a)(1) (""(1) 
Unfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce, and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce, are 
hereby declared unlawful.""). Thus, arguably, in Maryland, all ""persons"" are prohibited from engaging in any ""unfair or deceptive 
trade practices"" that ""affect commerce."" Id. Such a construction would arguably expand the CPA's reach even further. The 
parties do not argue this point; therefore, the Court does not consider it further. "
277,1," Chicago Prof'l Sports Ltd. P'ship v. Nat'l Basketball Ass'n, 754 F. Supp. 1336, 1353 (N.D. Ill. 1991), aff'd, 961 F.2d 667 (7th Cir. 
1992). "
279,2," United States District Judge Donald Graham presided over this case until the parties consented  [*6] to full magistrate judge 
jurisdiction, at which point Judge Graham referred the entire case to the Undersigned. [ECF Nos. 88; 89]. Patheon's motion to 
dismiss and Judge Graham's Order denying the motion predated the parties' consent. "
281,3," It is difficult to logically conceive of a scenario where an antitrust plaintiff is found to have antitrust standing, but not Article III 
standing. Nevertheless, the Court leaves open the theoretical possibility of such a situation. "
282,4," The parties spent a great deal of time in their briefs discussing the current status of the Collaboration Agreement, i.e., whether 
it is terminated or not. Patheon contends that it terminated the Collaboration Agreement because of Procaps' failure to perform. 
[ECF No. 174-6]. Despite seeking termination of the Collaboration Agreement in its complaint, Procaps rejected Patheon's 
termination offer. [ECF No. 171-12]. After reviewing the record, the Court agrees with Patheon that Procaps' position regarding 
the status of the Collaboration Agreement has shifted during the litigation. Regardless, the current status of the Collaboration 
Agreement is not directly before the Court in Patheon's instant motion. "
283,5," Interestingly enough, while the defendants initially lost before the Eleventh Circuit on their attack on the plaintiff's standing, they 
recently won on summary judgment, albeit on a different issue. Gulf States Reorganization Grp., Inc. v. Nucor Corp., 721 F.3d 
1281 (11th Cir. 2013). "
298,1," Another putative class of direct purchasers had also filed a motion for class certification. On the eve of the November 
 [**11] 2013 hearing, however, the direct purchasers and Defendants informed the Court they had reached a potential settlement 
and requested the Court stay any consideration of the pending motion for class certification until the settlement was finalized. 
Accordingly, the Court does not discuss this motion."
298,2," Defendants filed a motion for leave to file a surreply, but the motion was in fact the surreply brief itself (Court File No. 382). 
Indirect Purchasers and End Payors opposed the motion (Court File Nos. 403, 404). The local rules specifically state that ""[n]o 
additional briefs, affidavits, or other papers in support of or in opposition to a motion shall be filed without prior approval of the 
Court."" E.D. Tenn. L.R. 7.1(d) (emphasis added). The Court will reluctantly GRANT the motion given that the brief has already 
been filed. The Court cautions the parties that it will not look kindly upon further disregard of the local rules. "
300,3," At the hearing on these motions, End Payors indicated they wished to include this parenthetical clause in the class definition. 
The Court assumes it was also meant to be included in each of the damages subclasses and has included them accordingly. 
The inclusion of this parenthetical has no effect on the Court's decision discussed in this memorandum. "
303,4, Dr. Rausser submitted an amended damages computation that differed slightly from his original (Court File No. 236). 
307,5," In a published case, the Sixth Circuit adopted a similar view of this sort of individualized inquiry in the superiority context. 
Pipefitters Local 636 Ins. Fund v. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Mich., 654 F.3d 618 (6th Cir. 2011). Another ERISA-fiduciary class 
action, the court reversed the district court's certification order because ""determining whether an administrator is a fiduciary with 
respect to a particular action requires a functional analysis to determine if the administrator exerted any authority or control over 
a fund's assets when it took the action in question."" Id. at 631. Because the district court ""would be required to conduct 
individualized inquiries  [**39] into the [] terms and funding arrangements of each [] customer,"" which meant ""looking at the 
contract terms and funding arrangements of 550 to 875 class members,"" the necessary ""individualized inquiries"" precluded a 
class action from serving as the superior form of adjudication. Id. "
309,6," One might wonder why a PBM would accept a lower price than it paid the retailer. ""PBMs' profits come from a variety of 
different arrangements with insurers and plan sponsors. A PBM may charge the insurer or plan sponsor an administrative fee for 
each reimbursed prescription. A PBM may also retain some or all of the rebates received from  [**51] pharmaceutical "
310,," companies. In addition, a PBM may charge a higher price for a drug to the insurer or plan sponsor than it pays to the pharmacy, 
an arrangement known as spread pricing"" (Court File No. 282, Hughes Decl., ¶ 30). "
312,7," In his rebuttal report, Dr. Rausser argues, although some circumstances might exist where a PBM would be an end payor, they 
are very few. In deposition, however, he testified what really matters is the circumstances of each transaction (Court File No. 
284-1, Rausser Dep., pp. 289-90) (""Focus on the transaction. There is transactions [sic] that take place. . . . [I]f it turns out that 
ASP has price risk . . . [although] ASOs, generally speaking don't have any price risk. . . . [w]ell, now they are the third-party 
payor.""); (id. at p. 291-92) (""There are instances . . . where there is some [price] sharing arrangement . . . where [PBMs] have 
some of the price risk. . . . That's fine. Then they are a third party — they are a third-party payor. But the fundamental point is, 
follow the transactions.""). He did note that most PBMs are ""just service providers"" who ""don't have any price risk"" but ""[t]hose 
who function both as an agent and provide some insurance, they are a third-party payor"" (id. at p. 36)."
312,8," In his impact and damages models, Dr. Rausser removed rebates from the ""but-for"" world, assuming that King would have 
discontinued these rebates after generic entry (Court File No. 435, Rausser Decl., at ¶ 139). But rebates are relevant to the 
amount actually paid by the class and non-class TPPs (id.) (""Branded drug manufacturers typically use rebates to third-party 
payors as a way of encouraging favorable formulary status and, thus, producing larger sales.""). "
314,9," Dr. Rausser would likely contest this point and state that these end payors will frequently (if not always) bear the ""price risk."" 
But his methodology for making this determination is more or less undisclosed to the Court. "
319,10," End Payors placed greater reliance than Indirect Purchasers on the argument such an inquiry was not required. End Payors 
relied upon Sullivan v. DB Investments, Inc., 667 F.3d 273, 308 (3d Cir. 2011) (en banc), in which the Third Circuit noted 
""choice-of-law analysis would be particularly difficult in a nationwide class action where an array of factors beyond the residence 
of the class members must be considered, including, inter alia, the location  [**87] of the parties and the purchased items, and 
the place of contracting and performance."" Because this would ""unduly complicate the process for establishing predominance 
under Rule 23. . . . many courts find it inappropriate to decide choice of law issues incident to a motion for class certification."" Id. 
(quotation marks omitted). However, Sullivan involved the proper standard for approving class settlement, and ""in the settlement context, variations in state 
antitrust, consumer protection and unjust enrichment laws d[o] not present 'the types of insuperable obstacles' that could render 
class litigation unmanageable."" Id. at 303. In fact, the court noted that unlike ""situations 'where the certification inquiry [is] set 
against the backdrop of an impending trial,' the settlement context here does not present equivalent concerns."" Id. at 304 n.28 
(citation omitted). It is precisely these concerns Defendants have raised here. Sullivan acknowledges that some courts ignore choice-of-law analysis for the purposes of class certification. E.g., Singer v. 
AT&T Corp., 185 F.R.D. 681, 691-92 (S.D. Fla. 1998) (""It is well-established that consideration of choice of law issues at the 
class certification  [**88] stage is generally premature.""). But many courts, including the Sixth Circuit, have indicated otherwise. 
Pilgrim, 660 F.3d at 946-48. Accordingly, the Court must consider the choice-of-law issue at this stage. "
323,11," HN37[
] In Tennessee, typically courts determine whether a conflict exists between the states' laws before undergoing a 
choice-of-laws analysis, although some courts do not and others have noted ""[t]he order in which the interrelated analyses take 
place is not as important as the fact that they be conducted."" Gov't Employees Ins. Co. v. Bloodworth, No. M2003-02986-COA-
R10-CV, 2007 Tenn. App. LEXIS 404, 2007 WL 1966022, at *29 (Tenn. Ct. App. June 29, 2007) (comparing cases). The Court 
discusses choice-of-law first because it is the primary dispute between the parties. Conflict-of-law is discussed below, and, as 
stated infra, was given little attention by Indirect Purchasers. The Court does conclude, however, that a conflict exists between 
the laws of the forty-nine states and additional territories."
323,12," Section 145 states HN39[
] ""[t]he rights and liabilities of the parties with respect to an issue in tort are determined by the 
local law of the state, which with respect to that issue, has the most significant relationship to the occurrence and the parties 
under the principles stated in § 6."" Section 6 lists the following considerations: (a) the needs of the interstate and international systems, (b) the relevant policies of the forum, (c) the relevant policies of other interested states and the relative interests of those states in the determination of the 
particular issue, (d) the protection of justified expectations, "
324,," (e) the basic policies underlying the particular field of law, (f) certainty, predictability, and uniformity of result, and (g) ease in the determination and application of the law to be applied."
324,13," There is no reason to think the unjust enrichment and unfair trade practices claims would be different. In fact, the Sixth Circuit 
recently applied these considerations to violations of the Tennessee Consumer Protection Act. Smyrna v. Mun. Gas Auth. of 
Ga., 723 F.3d 640, 646 n.3 (6th Cir. 2013)."
324,14," Some ambiguity clouds this issue. The language of the Restatement appears to suggest the ""default"" rule that looks first to the 
place of injury applies only in personal injury and wrongful death cases. Compare Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws § 
145 (""The rights and liabilities of the parties with respect to an issue in tort are determined by the local law of the state, which 
with respect to that issue, has the most significant relationship to the occurrence and the parties under the principles stated in § 
6.""), with id. § 146 (""In an action for personal  [**106] injury, the local law of the state where the injury occurred determines the 
rights and liabilities of the parties, unless, with respect to the particular issue, some other state has a more significant 
relationship under the principles stated in § 6 to the occurrence and the parties, in which event the local law of the other state will 
be applied.""), and id. § 175 (including similar language in the context of wrongful death). However, the court in Hataway 
appeared to apply this ""default"" to all cases, Hataway, 830 S.W.2d at 59 (""The Restatement provides that HN41[
] the law of 
the state where the injury occurred will be applied unless some other state has a more significant relationship to the litigation.""), 
and subsequent courts have applied it similarly, see In re Bridgestone/Firestone, 138 S.W.3d 202, 208 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2003) 
(""Tennessee's tenuous links to the litigation are simply insufficient to overcome the default rule that Mexico, as the situs of the 
accidents at issue, will provide the applicable law.""). The Sixth Circuit has relied upon both interpretations at different times. 
Compare Montgomery, 580 F.3d at 459, with Smyrna, 723 F.3d at 646 n.3. For the purposes of this case, the  [**107] Court will 
assume there is no default presumption that the place of injury controls. Regardless, the Court concludes Tennessee's law does 
not apply to a nationwide class."
324,15," Indirect  [**108] Purchasers provide relatively little argument regarding their unjust enrichment claim and whether a choice-of-
laws analysis is necessary there. This is particularly surprising because Indirect Purchasers conceded such an analysis would 
be called for during the motion to dismiss briefing. Regardless, Indirect Purchasers' unjust enrichment claim is analyzed similar 
to their TTPA claim. Indirect Purchasers have pleaded this claim as an alternative to their antitrust claim and it relies upon the 
same theory (Court File No. 200, Motion to Dismiss Order, p. 47) (""[B]oth Plaintiffs have stated they are asserting their unjust 
enrichment claims as an alternative equitable remedy to their legal claims.""). The interests of the states discussed herein would 
mirror those in consideration of the antitrust claims. "
325,16," Defendants claim this is an inappropriate consideration. Contrary to Defendants' argument, the Restatement focuses on the 
policies of the forum state as well as the field of law. See Restatement (Second) § 145."
325,17," Based on the wording, though, it is possible some entities may have purchased in Tennessee but operate a business outside 
the state. Indirect Purchasers have not, however, identified any such entity. "
326,18," Considering the laws of Arizona, California, Florida, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, North 
Carolina, Tennessee, and Vermont. "
327,19," Although they did note that Defendants have adopted conflicting theories in response to End Payors' and Indirect Purchasers' 
motions (Court File No. 338, p. 35 n.44), this does not contend with the substance of the argument. "
328,20," Indirect Purchasers offer affidavits of representatives of each named plaintiff indicating that it operates a business in one of the 
subclass states and that it purchased Skelaxin on multiple occasions  [**121] (Court File Nos. 158-1, 158-2, 158-3, 202). Each 
individual indicates from whom the entity purchased Skelaxin but not where it did so. "
330,1," After carefully considering the papers filed with respect to this Motion, the Court deems the matter appropriate for decision 
without oral argument. Fed. R. Civ. P. 78; L.R. 7-15."
330,2," The Court GRANTS Defendants' Request for Judicial Notice to the extent that the Court uses the documents adduced in this 
Order. (ECF No. 5.) "
331,3," While the Court must accept Roque's allegations as true at this stage, the Court reminds Roque that she is subject is Federal 
Rule of Civil Procedure 11.  [*7] Rule 11 provides that by filing any paper with the court, a party—whether an attorney or pro 
se—""certifies that to the best of the person's knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the 
circumstances . . . [that] the factual contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely have 
evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(b)(2). As this case 
progresses, Roque's allegations will be tested against the evidence. If it turns out that any allegations violate Rule 11, Roque 
may be subject to sanctions within the Court's discretion. Id. (c)(1). "

344,2," Mr. Graham served on the WMATA Board of Directors from 1999-2010. During Banneker's exclusivity period, Mr. Graham was 
a member of WMATA's Planning, Development and Real Estate Committee. Mr. Graham was (and is) the D.C. Council member 
representing Ward One, where the Site is located."
344,3, The U Street Business Improvement District includes the Site.
344,4," The Amended Complaint mistakenly refers to the WMATA  [**7] ""Code of Conduct,"" not the WMATA Standards of Conduct. 
Banneker corrected its error in its response to WMATA's motion. See Opp'n to WMATA Mot. [Dkt. 24] at 4."
344,5," HN1[
] When a document is referred to in a complaint and is central to the plaintiff's claim, in reviewing a motion to dismiss 
the court may consider the document without converting the motion into one for summary judgment. Nat'l Shopmen Pension 
Fund v. Disa, 583 F. Supp. 2d 95, 99 (D.D.C. 2008). The Amended Complaint refers to the Cadwalader Report as central to 
Banneker's claim that Mr. Graham violated the WMATA Standards of Conduct. "
345,6," According to Mr. Bondi, there were rational business reasons for the failure of Banneker and WMATA to negotiate a final 
contract: In the two years that Banneker Ventures spent negotiating with Metro, Banneker Ventures did not adequately resolve two 
significant  [**9] issues: making a reasonable financial offer and finding a reliable development partner. Banneker Ventures 
initially lowered its offer price on the grounds that the Metro Board's requirement to include affordable housing caused a 
drop in the value of the project. While Banneker Ventures raised its financial offer somewhat in the ensuing negotiations, it 
was unable to raise its offer to a level that was acceptable to the Metro Board. Banneker Ventures was also unable to retain 
an experienced development partner, even though the Metro Board made it clear to Banneker Ventures that it must partner 
with one. At the time Banneker Ventures's negotiating period expired, Banneker's third development partner had dropped 
out of the project and Banneker Ventures has not identified a replacement. As Banneker Ventures struggled to resolve 
these issues, it lost support among Metro Board members. Cadwalader Report at 5. While Banneker relies on the Report's finding that Mr. Graham violated the WMATA Standards of 
Conduct, Banneker disputes the findings regarding why the parties failed to enter into a contract. For the purpose of this 
Opinion, this dispute is immaterial."
345,7," As of October 2012, the Site remained undeveloped and JBG Construction was awaiting the requisite approval from the D.C. 
Historic Preservation Review Board. Cadwalader Report at 28 n.103. As of the date of this Opinion, construction is ongoing. "

346,9, The Amended Complaint does not allege that Mr. Graham took any particular action in his capacity as a D.C. Council Member. 
349,10," While the Amended Complaint notes that Mr. Graham was a D.C. Council Member, see Am. Compl. ¶ 20, the allegations 
focus on actions he took as a WMATA Board Member, alleging that he ""used his WMATA Board position to derail the WMATA 
project with Banneker,"" see id. ¶ 10. Further, in opposing summary judgment, Banneker focuses only on the actions of Mr. 
Graham alleged to be in violation of WMATA Standards of Conduct. "

405,1," Plaintiffs attached to their opposition defendants' answers to interrogatories in which defendants stated that the settlement in 
the Allegro Matter was subject to a confidentiality agreement. Plaintiffs also sought judicial notice of (1) a copy of the as-built 
approved plan from the City of Malibu with respect to the grading, (2) correspondence from the City of Malibu regarding the 
grading dated November 23, 2010, stating that no imported soils were used in the grading, and (3) defendant Wolfe's 
correspondence dated December 3, 2010, with Public Works requesting documents evidencing the placing of fill dirt at plaintiffs' 
residence. "
406,2," Although plaintiffs alleged in their SAC that they became aware of their claim in February 2012, plaintiffs initially propounded 
discovery regarding the Allegro Matter in November 2011. "
407,3, All statutory references herein are to the Code of Civil Procedure unless otherwise indicated. 
408,4," Plaintiffs assert that the holding of settlement funds does not arise out of the provision of professional services and thus that 
section 340.6 does not apply for that reason. We disagree, as in this case, the funds in the trust account are settlement 
 [***22] proceeds, Engstrom's conduct in holding such funds arises out of the provision of professional services, namely, the 
settlement of the case on plaintiffs' behalf."
408,5," Contrary to Engstrom's contention, Probate Code section 16460 does not state that it applies unless any potential breach of 
trust is covered  [***23] by another statute. Probate Code section 16460, subdivision (a) states it applies “[u]nless a claim is "
409,," previously barred by adjudication, consent, limitation, or otherwise.” The use of the word “previously” does not mean any other 
limitations statute is paramount; rather, it connotes that any failure to provide an appropriate accounting, given that such duties 
are generally ongoing, cannot formerly have been the subject of disposition."
409,6," A deceit, within the meaning of Civil Code section 1709 is, in relevant part, “[t]he suggestion, as a fact, of that which is not true, 
by one who does not believe it to be true … [and] [¶] … [¶] … [t]he suppression of a fact, by one who is bound to disclose it, or 
who gives information of other facts which are likely to mislead for want of communication of that fact.” (Civ. Code, § 1710.) "
410,7," The pertinent causes of action are the fourth cause of action (fraudulent concealment of embezzlement), seventh cause of 
action (unjust enrichment), eighth cause of action (unfair business practices), 10th cause of action (conversion), 12th cause of 
action (conspiracy to commit fraud), and 13th cause of action (accounting)."
410,8," Although Rules of Professional Conduct, rule 4-100(B)(3) specifies that such accountings shall be kept for a minimum of “five 
years,” the rule does not obviate a fiduciary's duty to provide an accounting. "
411,9," Plaintiffs assert in their opening brief that Engstrom conceded the fill dirt revelation was a basis for the reduction in plaintiffs' 
settlement figure. However, plaintiffs do not offer any factual support for this assertion. "
424,1," In Mitchael, the Tenth Circuit declined to extend Supreme Court precedent establishing that ""the coordinated activity of a parent 
and subsidiary must be viewed  [*18] as that of a single enterprise,"" and thus a parent and subsidiary cannot conspire with each 
other for purposes of § 1. 179 F.3d at 857 (quoting Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., 467 U.S. 752, 771, 104 S. 
Ct. 2731, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628 (1984)). However, neither Mitchael nor Copperweld apply precisely to Plaintiffs' allegations against 
Centura, where Plaintiffs have alleged conspiratorial activity by both Centura and Audubon, and where Audubon is only partially, 
and not wholly, owned by Centura."
424,2," Centura also argues that its participation in CASCA's actions to petition DORA regarding Plaintiffs' business practices cannot 
provide the basis for § 1 liability. (ECF No. 94 at 11-13.) Because the Court finds that Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged a 
conspiracy without imputing CASCA's actions to Centura, the Court will defer consideration of this argument to its discussion of 
CASCA's Motion, below in Part III.A.2. "
425,3," Thus, the Court need not consider Audubon's argument that, even if Audubon  [*23] acted as Centura's agent, Centura's acts 
are not attributable to Audubon. (See ECF No. 114 at 4-6.) "
427,4," Plaintiffs contend in their Response to Aetna's and Anthem's Motions that they have not only alleged conscious parallel 
conduct, but also alleged that the Insurer Defendants actually reached agreement with Centura and HCA. (ECF No. 124 at 6-7, 
9.) However, the Court has reviewed the paragraphs Plaintiffs cite in support of this contention, as well as the entirety of the 
FAC, and finds that Plaintiffs in fact allege only that Centura and HCA ""attempted . . . to convince"" the Insurers (FAC ¶ 33), 
""asked the health  [*28] insurance companies . . . to join them"", ""requested health insurers not to do business with Plaintiffs"" (id. 
¶ 69), and ""attempted to use their market power to reach agreement with"" the Insurers (id. ¶ 82). Apart from these allegations of 
attempts and requests, Plaintiffs make only conclusory references to the Insurers' role in the ""conspiracy"". (See, e.g., id. ¶¶ 54, 
58.) Thus, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have not directly alleged an agreement, and instead supply facts (such as Centura's and 
HCA's requests, and the Insurers' subsequent parallel actions) that are intended to permit the reasonable inference of an 
agreement. "
447,1," This Court will refer to Mellon, NDS and MERS collectively as ""defendants."""
447,2, Documents pertaining to Mr. Flores' loan and default were recorded with the Official Records County of Tulare.
447,3," The record is unclear as to why Joe Flores appears as a plaintiff. As such, this Court refers to ""plaintiffs,"" rather than simply 
""Mr. Flores"" when addressing certain of the complaint's claims and allegations. "
449,4," HN7[
] ""We have extended the 'incorporation by reference' doctrine to situations in which the plaintiff's claim depends on the 
contents of a document, the defendant attaches the document to its motion to dismiss, and the parties do not dispute the 
authenticity of the document,  [**10] even though the plaintiff does not explicitly allege the contents of that document in the 
complaint."" Knievel v. ESPN, 393 F.3d 1068, 1076 (9th Cir. 2005) (citing Parrino, 146 F.3d at 706). "
451,5," Plaintiffs' opposition papers make numerous references to invalid assignment of Mr. Flores' loan documents. However, neither 
the opposition papers nor complaint sufficiently identify such assignments to validate plaintiffs' assertion of invalid assignments. "
464,6," The ""relationship between a lending institution and its borrower-client is not fiduciary in nature."" Nymark, 231 Cal.App.3d at 
1093, n. 1, 283 Cal.Rptr. 53 (1991) (citing Price v. Wells Fargo Bank, 213 Cal.App.3d 465, 476-478, 261 Cal.Rptr. 735 (1989)). "
465,," A commercial lender is entitled to pursue its own economic interests in a loan transaction. Nymark, 231 Cal.App.3d at 1093, n. 1, 
283 Cal.Rptr. 53(citing  [**65] Kruse v. Bank of America, 202 Cal.App.3d 38, 67, 248 Cal.Rptr. 217 (1988)). Absent ""special 
circumstances"" a loan transaction is ""at arms-length and there is no fiduciary relationship between the borrower and lender."" 
Oaks Management, 145 Cal.App.4th at 466, 51 Cal.Rptr.3d 561 (""the bank is in no sense a true fiduciary""); see Downey v. 
Humphreys, 102 Cal. App. 2d 323, 332, 227 P.2d 484 (1951) (""A debt is not a trust and there is not a fiduciary relation between 
debtor and creditor as such.""). The complaint fails to allege facts to impose fiduciary liability on defendants in the absence of 
genuine supporting facts. "
471,7," This evaluation is supported by plaintiffs' failure to oppose dismissal of the complaint's RESPA and FDCPA claims, the only 
means to support federal question jurisdiction and possible remand to state court with subsequent delay if this Court declined to 
exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining California statutory and common law  [**87] claims. See 28 U.S.C. § 
1367(c)(2), (3). "
477,1," As such, the Court finds the supplemental motions filed by Choice Hotels International, Inc. (doc. 107) and Sabre Holdings 
Corporation (doc. 110) to be MOOT."

478,5," The terms ""horizontal"" and ""vertical"" agreements are used to indicate the business relationships between the agreeing parties: 
""[r]estraints imposed by agreement between competitors have traditionally been denominated as horizontal restraints, and those 
imposed by agreement between firms at different levels of distribution as vertical restraints."" Business Elecs. Corp. v. Sharp 
Elecs. Corp., 485 U.S. 717, 730, 108 S. Ct. 1515, 99 L. Ed. 2d 808 (1988). "

31 , 2012), available at http://www.oft.gov.uk/news-and-updates/press/2012/65-12#.UtlerhDnbcs. Though not cited directly in the 
Complaint, the Court agrees with Plaintiffs that it may take judicial notice, under Federal Rule of Evidence 201, of facts related to 
the investigation that are ""not subject to reasonable dispute."" Fed. R. Evid. 201; see also (Resp. 69) (asking the Court to take 
judicial notice of facts from the above-cited press release). "
481,7," Inter-brand competition is price competition among competitors. An example of Hotel Defendants agreeing horizontally to fix 
inter-brand competition would be if Defendants Hilton, Marriot, and Best Western agreed to set prices on their King size 
bedrooms in Dallas at $149/night."

for without either component, the scheme would fail."")"

481,10," An example of a tacit agreement comes from Interstate Circuit v. United States, 306 U.S. 208, 59 S. Ct. 467, 83 L. Ed. 610 
(1939), in which a group of motion picture distributors ""who never communicated directly with one another, nonetheless had "
482,," entered into a tacit agreement with one another by acting in accordance with [a] letter's demands, because the letter [sent to 
each distributor by two movie theater operators] made it clear that all eight had received the letter, the economic context made it 
clear that all eight needed to act uniformly or all would lose business, and all eight did in fact impose the conditions."" White, 635 
F.3d at 576 (summarizing Interstate Circuit)."
482,11," See Twombly, 550 U.S. at 554 (citing Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Serv. Corp., 465 U.S. 752, 104 S. Ct. 1464, 79 L. Ed. 2d 
775 (1984) and Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986) for 
the proposition that plaintiffs must put forth evidence at later stages of § 1 litigation to either ""exclude"" or ""rule out the possibility 
that the  [**31] defendants were acting independently"")."
482,12," Other allegations, which only the dissent found significant, include: a quote from the former executive of one defendant as 
saying that entering  [**32] neighboring territory ""might be a good way to turn a quick dollar but that doesn't make it right""; and 
an allegation that defendants ""communicate amongst themselves through numerous industry associations."" Twombly, 550 U.S. 
at 574 (Stevens, J., dissenting). The majority, somewhat summarily, rejected both these allegations. See id. at 567 n.12, 568 
n.13. "
483,13," Courts  [**33] (and the parties here) sometimes refer to these ""factual enhancements"" as ""plus factors,"" defined as ""facts that 
tend to ensure that courts punish concerted action—an actual agreement—instead of the unilateral, independent conduct of 
competitors."" In re Ins. Brokerage Antitrust Litig., 618 F.3d 300, 323 (3d Cir. 2010) (brackets and quotations omitted). However, 
the term ""plus factors"" is actually drawn from cases at the later stages of litigation, where a different sort of analysis—sometimes 
inappropriately applied at the motion to dismiss stage—is conducted. See Evergreen Partnering Group, Inc. v. Pactiv Corp., 720 
F.3d 33, 46 (2013). To avoid confusion, this Court follows Twombly's language by using ""factual enhancements."""
483,14," This enhancement was actually two enhancements identified by Plaintiffs, but since they entail the same overlapping factual 
allegations, the Court combined them so that it may address both at once. "
484,15," The Seventh Circuit, through Judge Posner, explains that ""[p]rice discrimination is in fact quire common in competitive 
industries"" in which ""competitive products,"" such as hotel rooms, ""are not perfect substitutes to all consumers."" Brand Name 
Prescription Drugs, 288 F.3d at 1030-31. But ""price discrimination would be feasible only if the [supplier] could prevent (or at 
least limit) arbitrage—the erasure of a price difference not attributable to a cost difference . . . by a middleman's buying from the 
favored customers and reselling to the disfavored."" Id. at 1031. The RPM agreements  [**39] are arguably each Hotel 
Defendant's effort to prevent or limit arbitrage created by OTAs buying rooms at cheaper prices and reselling to disfavored 
customers at a lower price than that disfavored customer is willing to pay."

528,1," Steward alleges that, long before its failed acquisition attempt, Blue Cross was in part responsible for the financial struggles at 
Landmark. In March 2011, the Special Master sued Blue Cross, alleging that Blue Cross had made inadequate payments to 
Landmark. (Compl. ¶ 22.)"
528,2, Steward's obligations under  [**5] the Purchase Agreement were subject to certain conditions precedent. 
529,3," The Complaint describes the BlueCard Program as a national program whereby Blue Cross & Blue Shield plans in various 
states allow subscribers of one plan to access benefits and rates of another plan while traveling or living outside of their home 
plan's service area. (Compl.  [**9] ¶ 46.)"
529,4," A monopsony is a market in which a single buyer has disproportionate power — a ""buyer's monopoly."" See Roger D. Blair and 
Jeffrey L. Harrison, Antitrust Policy and Monopsony, 76 Cornell L. Rev. 297, 320 (1991).  [**10] In this context, Steward alleges 
that Blue Cross exercised monopsony power as a buyer of commercial hospital services. "
530,5," A § 2 claim for attempted monopolization requires that the plaintiff establish: ""(1) that the defendant has engaged in predatory 
or anticompetitive conduct with (2) a specific  [**12] intent to monopolize and (3) a dangerous probability of achieving monopoly 
power."" Diaz Aviation Corp. v. Airport Aviation Servs., 716 F.3d 256, 265 (1st Cir. 2013) (quoting Spectrum Sports, Inc. v. 
McQuillan, 506 U.S. 447, 456, 113 S. Ct. 884, 122 L. Ed. 2d 247 (1993)). "
531,6," The Court declines to credit Blue Cross' reliance on Trinko for the proposition that the heavily regulated nature of health care 
markets makes it improper for courts to intervene on antitrust grounds. See Trinko, 540 U.S. at 412  [**17] (""One factor of 
particular importance is the existence of a regulatory structure designed to deter and remedy anticompetitive harm. Where such 
a structure exists, the additional benefit to competition provided by antitrust enforcement will tend to be small.""). Whereas the 
telecommunications industry at issue in Trinko was the subject of extensive antitrust regulation, it cannot be said that the same 
level of antitrust-focused regulation exists in health care markets. See D. Andrew Austin and Thomas L. Hungerford, Cong. 
Research Serv., R40834, The Market Structure of the Health Insurance Industry 46-47 (2009)."
531,7," See, e.g., In re Elevator Antitrust Litigation, 502 F.3d 47, 52 (2d Cir. 2007) (""[B]ecause plaintiffs do not allege that defendants 
terminated any prior course of dealing — the sole exception to the broad right of a firm to refuse to deal with its competitors — 
the allegations are insufficient to state a [] claim.""); see also Christy Sports, LLC v. Deer Valley Resort Co., 555 F.3d 1188, 1197 
(10th Cir. 2009)."
531,8," See, e.g., MetroNet Servs. Corp. v. Qwest Corp., 383 F.3d 1124, 1133 (9th Cir. 2004); Stein v. Pac. Bell, 172 F. App'x 192, 194 
(9th Cir. 2006). "
532,9," While it cannot be said that Steward and Blue Cross had a prior course of dealing with each other with respect to Landmark, 
the Court is not aware of case law that would preclude consideration of Blue Cross' own direct prior course of dealing with 
Landmark. "
533,10," Likewise, that Blue Cross serves as an intermediary between the producer (the hospital) and the ultimate consumer (the 
patient) does not preclude § 2 liability for an illegal refusal to deal. See, e.g., Otter Tail Power Co. v. United States, 410 U.S. 
366, 382, 93 S. Ct. 1022, 35 L. Ed. 2d 359 (1973) (finding a power provider in violation of the antitrust laws for its refusal to sell 
power to certain municipalities in order to prevent those municipalities from establishing their own power infrastructure and 
distributing power directly to households)."
533,11," Without belaboring the point, it is worth noting again that the unique role played by health insurance intermediaries has a 
bearing on the allegations in this case. As compared with a traditional manufacturing firm that purchases its raw materials from 
Party A and sells  [**26] its finished product to Party B, a health insurer such as Blue Cross employs a wholly different business 
model in which it sells an insurance product to Party A, contracts to purchase medical services from Party B, then turns around 
and grants access to those services to Party A. Given this unique function, it should come as no surprise that a refusal to deal 
allegation against a health insurance provider would implicate the provider's refusal to buy. "
538,12," Contrary to the position taken by Blue Cross, the Complaint's acknowledgement that some patients cross state lines to obtain 
treatment is by no means fatal  [**45] to the claim. In discussing the Elzinga-Hogarty test for consumer origin, courts have 
previously found a relevant geographic market where up to 10% of consumers were found to have gone outside the relevant 
area to obtain a product. See Nilavar v. Mercy Health Sys.-W. Ohio, 244 F. App'x. 690, 697 (6th Cir. 2007); Gordon v. Lewistown 
Hosp., 272 F. Supp. 2d 393, 426 (M.D. Pa. 2003). "
539,13," The Noerr-Pennington Doctrine is rooted in First Amendment concerns about the chilling of political speech. See E. R.R. 
Presidents Conf. v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 81 S. Ct. 523, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464 (1961)."
539,14," Although briefed by both parties, the Court need not reach the issue of whether the petitioning might be subject to the sham 
exception to the Noerr-Pennington Doctrine."
539,15," Those factors include: ""(1) the nature of the actor's conduct; (2) the actor's motive; (3) the contractual interests with which the 
conduct interferes; (4) the interests sought to be advanced by the actor; (5) the balance of social interests in protecting freedom 
of action of the actor and the contractual freedom of the putative plaintiff; (6) the proximity of the actor's conduct to the 
interference complained of; and (7) the parties' relationship."" Belliveau Bldg. Corp. v. O'Coin, 763 A.2d 622, 628 n.3 (R.I. 2000) 
(citing Restatement (Second) of Torts § 767, at 26-7 (1979)). "
540,16," The Court declines to credit Blue Cross' argument that Steward has not satisfied the causation element of its tortious 
interference claims based on the conditions precedent to the Purchase Agreement that remained at the time of the alleged 
interference. Resolution of this issue on a motion to dismiss is premature. See Ed Peters Jewelry Co. v. C & J Jewelry Co., 51 F. 
Supp. 2d 81, 102 (D.R.I. 1999),  [**51] aff'd, 215 F.3d 182 (1st Cir. 2000) (""[C]ausation [in tortious interference claims] is 
generally a matter left to the consideration of the jury.""). "
542,1," The Court has subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1338(a)-(b), 2201, 2202, 1367(a). Citation to this Court's 
docket is noted as ""R. [docket entry number]."" "
543,2," ANSI is a nationally recognized coordinator of voluntary standards  [*10] development in the United States through which 
organizations establish and improve national consensus standards. Answer at 23. "
544,3," Citing Pfizer, Inc. v. Teva Pharms. USA, Inc., 803 F. Supp.2d 409, 432 (E.D. Va. 2011), Weber argues Therasense added a 
third requirement at the pleading stage: that ""a party must make an initial showing from which it may be plausibly inferred that . . 
. the intent to deceive is the single most likely explanation for the non-disclosure."" Weber Br. at 11. The Federal Circuit's post-
Therasense holding in Delano refutes this  [*12] suggestion and controls here. See 655 F.3d at 1350. The ""single most likely 
explanation"" standard is an evidentiary one, reserved for the merits."
544,4," Weber argues that its representative for ANSI 2005, Christopher Childers, cannot be the ""who"" for the inequitable conduct 
claim because he was not associated with the filing or prosecution of the '874 patent. Weber Br. at 12. That argument misses the 
mark because Sears already clearly identifies three other individuals who participated in the filing of the '071 and '874 
applications. Sears offers Childers merely as an additional link between Weber and the ANSI Standards. "
545,5," Weber argues that merely being aware of a reference  [*15] in connection with other applications is not enough because ""'[a] 
reference may be many pages long, and its various teachings may be relevant to different applications for different reasons. 
Thus, one cannot assume that an individual, who generally knew that a reference existed, also knew of the specific material 
information contained in that reference.'"" Weber Br. at 13 (quoting Exergen, 575 F.3d at 1330). Other than this bald quotation, 
however, Weber does not refute that it is reasonable to infer (at this dismissal-motion stage, the evidence is viewed in Sears's 
favor) that Weber was aware of ANSI 2005 Standard 1.3.10. Given the same-page proximity of Standards 1.3.7 and 1.3.10 and 
the centrality of ANSI standards to the outdoor grill market, the Court may reasonably infer that Bruno, Roche, and Tallitsch 
knew of the allegedly material information contained in Standard 1.3.10. "
548,6," For example, a prospective grill purchaser would find 24 retailers of the Weber Genesis E-Series in the Chicago area alone 
through Weber's ""Find a Dealer"" function at http://dealer.weber.com. "
549,7," Weber also argues for the first time that Kmart Holding Corporation and Kmart Corporation—neither of whom have ever before 
been discussed in this case—should be added to the lawsuit. Weber Contract Br. at 3. That request cannot be made in a brief: 
""It is a basic principle that the complaint may not be amended by the briefs in opposition to a motion to dismiss, nor can it be 
amended by the briefs on appeal."" Agnew v. National Collegiate Athletic Ass'n, 683 F.3d 328, 348 (7th Cir. 2012) (internal 
citation omitted). If Weber wishes to join Kmart as a party to this lawsuit, it must do so in a formal motion; a glancing reference to 
a previously unmentioned party will not suffice. "
556,1," Although originally approved by the FDA for treatment of major depressive disorder, the FDA later approved Zoloft for the 
treatment of ""obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, 
and social anxiety disorder."" Complaint ¶ 19. "
558,2," Because all the documents of which the parties request the Court take judicial notice are matters of public record, and neither 
party opposes the other's requests, the Court GRANTS the parties' requests as to all documents, and has taken notice of the 
adjudicative facts contained therein. See MGIC Indem. Co. v. Weisman, 803 F.2d 500, 505 (9th Cir. 1986) (holding a court may 
take judicial notice of court records); Missud v. Oakland Coliseum Joint Venture, No. 12-02967 JCS, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
91528, 2013 WL 812428, at *10 (N.D. Cal. 2013)  [*13] (taking judicial notice of court orders because they are matters of public 
record); In re Epogen & Aranesp Off-Label Mktg. & Sales Practices Litig., 590 F. Supp. 2d 1282, 1286 (C.D. Cal. 2008) (taking 
judicial notice of FDA-approved drug labels); see also Fed. R. Evid. 201(d). "
561,3," The ""proper definition of 'unfair' conduct against consumers is 'currently in flux' among California courts,"" and some appellate 
opinions have applied a more stringent test, particularly for conduct that threatens an incipient violation of antitrust law. Davis v. 
HSBC Bank Nevada, N.A., 691 F.3d 1152, 1169 (9th Cir. 2012)."
561,4," Plaintiff's causes of action under the CLRA, the fraud prong of the UCL, and  [*22] the FAL all sound in fraud and are therefore 
all subject to the heightened pleading requirement of Rule 9(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. See Kearns, 567 F.3d at 
1125 (""[W]e have specifically ruled that HN8[
] Rule 9(b)'s heightened pleading standards apply to claims for violations of the CLRA and UCL."")."
561,5," In her opposition, Plaintiff similarly argues that her ""injury [was] the deception at the point of sale."" Opp'n at 23. "
562,6," HN12[
] The Ninth Circuit has held that claims under the UCL begin to run on the date of the defendant's violation and not the 
date of discovery. See Karl Storz Endoscopy–Am., Inc. v. Surgical Techs., Inc., 285 F.3d 848, 857 (9th Cir. 2002). However, the 
California Supreme Court clarified recently that claims under the UCL are ""governed by common law accrual rules,"" including 
delayed discovery. Aryeh, 55 Cal. 4th at 1196. The Ninth Circuit's interpretation of California law is ""'binding in the absence of 
any subsequent indication from the California courts that our interpretation was incorrect,'"" Jones–Hamilton Co. v. Beazer 
Materials & Servs., Inc., 973 F.2d 688, 696 n.4 (9th Cir. 1992) (quoting Owen v. United States, 713 F.2d 1461, 1464 (9th Cir. 
1983));  [*28] in this case, the Aryeh decision is a clear indication that the Ninth Circuit was incorrect in holding that the delayed 
discovery rule is not available to toll the statute of limitations for claims under the UCL. "
563,7," The Court notes that Plaintiff's opposition does not provide further illumination on this point either. Plaintiff simply states, 
""These allegations show that Plaintiff was unaware of Pfizer's deception until early 2012. It follows, thus, that there was no way 
for Plaintiff to have known she was injured until the information she was deprived of was made known to her. . . . Plaintiff had no 
idea she had been misled until early 2012."" Opp'n at 23. "
564,8," Plaintiff states in her opposition that should the Court grant Defendant's motion on time-barred grounds, ""such deficiencies 
could be cured through amendment. Plaintiff could provide the (1) circumstances of her discovery; (2) specify whether she was 
ever made aware of any of the various publications cited in Plaintiff's Complaint; and explain what steps Plaintiff took following 
her discovery to bring this action to Court."" Opp'n at 23 n.11."
564,9," The Complaint also alleges a national issue and injunctive relief class, and in Count I seeks declaratory relief on behalf of that 
class. Complaint ¶¶ 75-85, 93-94, 138. Plaintiff now seeks to ""remov[e] the national issue and injunctive relief allegations"" and to 
limit its prayer for declaratory relief to California consumer protection laws. Opp'n at 9. Because the Complaint is dismissed with 
leave to amend, Plaintiff's request for leave to amend the Complaint in this manner is GRANTED."
564,10," Because Plaintiff's motion for leave to file a surreply, ECF No. 94, does not bear on whether her claims are time-barred, 
Plaintiff's motion is DENIED as moot. "
566,1, The factual recitation is derived generally from the TAC. 
575,2," The  [*32] form of Mr. Chand's filed FAC may eliminate bolding and relining appearing in the proposed FAC but not otherwise 
deviate from the proposed FAC without this Court's order. "
589,1, The Honorable Karl K. Sakamoto presided. 
592,2," HRCP Rule 23(a) and (b)(2) state in relevant part: HN1[
] (a) Prerequisites to a class action. One or more members of a class may sue or be sued as representative 
parties on behalf of all only if (1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable, (2) there are 
questions of law or fact common to the class, (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the 
claims or defenses of the class, and (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the 
class. (b) Class actions maintainable. An action may be maintained as a class action if the prerequisites of subdivision (a) are 
satisfied, and in addition: . . . (2) the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class, thereby 
making appropriate final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole . . . . "
593,3," Defendants asserted: In this case, Plaintiff does not have any evidence to support his allegation that the actions of HTH Defendants negatively 
affected competition. . . . Indeed, Plaintiff's lack of evidence is a result of the simple fact that every other hotel was doing 
the same thing that HTH Defendants were doing. In fact, the eighty-five percent (85%)/fifteen percent (15%) split used by 
[Pacific Beach Hotel] in distributing service charges is a standard provision found in many Unite Here! Local 5 Union 
contracts. The Waikiki hotels  [***16] that contain such a provision in their current union contract that HTH Defendants are 
aware of include: (1) Hilton Hawaiian Village; (2) Sheraton Waikiki Hotel; (3) Sheraton Moana Surfrider Hotel; (4) Sheraton 
Princess Kaiulani Hotel; (5) Queen Kapiolani Hotel; (6) Hale Koa Hotel (75/25 split); (7) Hyatt Regency Waikiki Resort & 
Spa; (8) Waikiki Beach Marriot Resort & Spa; (9) Kahala Hotel; (10) Royal Hawaiian Hotel; and (11) Ala Moana Hotel."
593,4," Gurrobat explained: Plaintiff has two expert witnesses who will identify the ""nature of the competition"" and describe the impact on competition of 
Defendants helping themselves to the tip income that belongs to Plaintiff and the Class. Long-time isle hotelier Andre 
Tatibouet and Bank of Hawaii's now-retired chief economist Paul Brewbaker are serving as Plaintiff's experts and have 
provided the relevant opinions that any hotel that complies with the law by distributing the entire service charge has higher 
labor costs and pricing structure than Defendants and is therefore at a competitive disadvantage to Defendants. "
595,5," HRS § 388-11 provides in relevant part: HN2[
] The court in any action brought under this section shall, in addition to any judgment awarded to the plaintiff or 
plaintiffs, allow interest of six per cent per year from the date the wages were due, costs of action, including costs of fees of 
any nature, and reasonable attorney's fees, to be paid by the defendant."
595,6," HN3[
] A ""personal action,"" for the purposes of HRS § 657-1(4) has been defined as: an  [***24] action brought for the recovery of personal property, for the enforcement of a contract or to recover for its 
breach, or for the recovery of damages for the commission of an injury to the person or property; an action for the recovery 
of a debt, or damages from the breach of contract, or for a specific personal chattel, or for the satisfaction in damages for 
injury to the person or property. Au v. Au, 63 Haw. 210, 217, 626 P.2d 173, 179 (1981) (citations omitted). "
596,7," The court explained: Throughout the entire course of this case, the Defendants have acted as one. Defendants chose to be jointly represented 
by the same legal counsel, filed  [***26] all of their motions and oppositions together, and even shared the same 
representative during settlement conferences. Only after summary judgment was granted did Defendants first make an 
argument based on their separate and distinct identities. Based on Defendants' conduct, the Court finds that it was 
reasonable for the Court to rely on such conduct in concluding that judgment should be entered against Defendants jointly. 
Accordingly, the Court finds that to allow Defendants to raise a new argument based on their separate legal identities would 
be inequitable."
596,8," It appears that the court entered an Amended Final Judgment because its January 18, 2012 Final Judgment did not specifically 
resolve all claims against all parties, as required by HRS § 641-1(a), HRCP Rule 58, and Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & 
White, 76 Hawai'i 115, 869 P.2d 1334 (1994)."
596,9," The Amended Final Judgment awarded $1,678,783.00 in damages, and $305,256.40 in fees/costs, to the  [***27] Plaintiff 
Class."
596,10," Defendants assert that the court erred in equating ""tip income"" under HRS § 481B-14 with ""earned compensation"" under HRS 
§ 388-6. They state: In fact, a worker never ""earns"" the service fees that are above and beyond what he is contractually entitled to. Any part of 
the service fees that an employee might claim as the result (solely) of an employer's failure to make full disclosure was 
simply an unearned windfall. "
597,11," Defendants explain that, because Gurrobat never worked at the Pagoda Hotel, ""it is insufficient to rely on unidentified Pagoda 
Hotel employees who are purportedly similarly situated to obtain standing to assert claims with respect to Pagoda Hotel."" They 
further elaborate: For  [***29] similar reasons, Gurrobat failed to establish that his claims are typical of the claims of the class members—
especially those employed at Pagoda Hotel. Assuming arguendo that Gurrobat may have a cause of action against Pacific 
Beach Corporation, he still could not represent a class with claims concerning Pagoda Hotel, which never employed him. . . 
. Nor did Plaintiff proffer any evidence supporting any exception to Rule 23's typicality or adequate class representative 
requirements. . . . Moreover, the service charge distribution practices at the Pacific Beach Hotel and the Pagoda Hotel 
differed. Not only were the percentage breakdowns of the service charges different, the hotels' definition of ""management 
employee"" differed as well. Thus, the Circuit Court should not have accepted Gurrobat's assertion that his claim was typical 
of those of the class members, since many of the class members were allegedly harmed by a different policy."
597,12," Defendants contend that Pacific Beach Corporation should not be held liable for any service charge income due to employees 
at the Pagoda Hotel because the alleged violations at each hotel involved separate groups of employees with different 
employers,  [***30] Pacific Beach Corporation had no managerial responsibility over employees at the Pagoda Hotel, and 
Gurrobat failed to establish any nexus between the practices of the Pacific Beach Corporation and the harm alleged at the 
Pagoda Hotel."
597,13," Defendants admit that HTH Corporation and Pacific Beach Corporation collectively operate the Pacific Beach Hotel, and HTH 
Corporation operates the Pagoda Hotel. They contend, however, that there was no evidence that HTH Corporation qualified as 
an ""employer"" under HRS Chapter 388. Instead, they maintain that Pacific Beach Corporation is the employer of all individuals 
who work at the Pacific Beach Hotel, and Pagoda Hotel, Inc. is the employer of all individuals who work at the Pagoda Hotel."
597,14," Gurrobat asserts that the ""tip income"" referred to in HRS § 481B-14 was ""earned"" compensation because the statute obligated 
Defendants to pay such service charge income to members of the Plaintiff Class. He elaborates: Because the Hotel Defendants made no disclosure to consumers about using a portion of the service charge for expenses 
other than payments to service employees, the law obligated them to pay all of the service charge to class members as ""tip 
income."" Hence, by the Hotel  [***32] Defendants' own definition of ""earned"" (i.e., not ""above and beyond"" the amount to 
which the contract entitled an employee), the law obligated them to pay the Class members, and the tip income compelled 
by Section 481B-14 was therefore ""earned"" by laboring in a ""disclosure-free"" environment. "
598,15," Gurrobat explains that his non-employment at the Pagoda Hotel would not affect his standing to bring suit against Defendants 
or his appropriateness as a class representative. Because he had worked at the Pacific Beach Hotel, which was operated by 
HTH Corporation and Pacific Beach Corporation, he had standing to bring his own claim against both Defendants. He further states that, because the Pacific Beach Hotel and the Pagoda Hotel were both owned by HTH Corporation, and jointly 
operated by HTH Corporation and Pacific Beach Corporation, there was no meaningful distinction between the class segments 
at the two hotels. He elaborates: The fact that some worked at one hotel and some worked at another is a difference without a distinction because both 
segments of the Class, the Pacific Beach Hotel workers and the Pagoda Hotel workers, worked for a common owner and 
had the same joint operators of their  [***33] respective hotels. The only differences were thus location and perhaps dollar 
amounts. However, the Hotel Defendants have not shown that such differences between the two segments of the Class 
make Gurrobat inadequate or non-typical as a [HRCP] Rule 23 representative."
598,16," Defendants contend that Gurrobat relies on a settlement conference statement, in which Pacific Beach Corporation and HTH 
Corporation stated that they operated the Pagoda Hotel. They argue, however, that this statement did not constitute an 
admission by Defendants because it was not admissible under Hawai'i Rules of Evidence Rule 408 and it was a mistake that 
conflicted with Defendants' statements throughout the litigation. In support of this position, they point out that Defendants 
objected to Gurrobat's proposed Final Judgment on the ground that Pacific Beach Corporation did not own or operate the 
Pagoda Hotel and, therefore, should not be liable for the entire amount of the judgment."
598,17," Gurrobat argues that, while Clayton Act and Sherman Act cases require a resulting ""antitrust injury,"" an unfair method of 
competition claim under HRS § 480-13(a) simply requires the plaintiff to show some type of injury to ""fair competition."" 
Accordingly, he contends: "
599,," In short, Gurrobat is merely required to show how Pacific Beach's acts unfairly affect competition, not that Defendant's acts 
constitute a Clayton or Sherman Act violation and caused the type of price-increasing effect that those federal statutes aim 
to prevent. The reports of Mr. Tatibouet and Dr. Brewbaker plainly satisfy this requirement. They show that by their 
improper acts, Pacific Beach has gained a competitive advantage over any other law compliant, non-disclosing hotel or 
restaurant that remits the entire service charge to their food and beverage servers. . . . Thus, Gurrobat has shown that 
Pacific Beach's unfair acts have a negative effect on fair competition that was only made possible by Pacific 
 [***37] Beach's violation of HRS § 481B-14 (i.e., retaining portions of the service charge without proper disclosure to 
customers) and by the injury to Gurrobat (loss of tip income) which flowed from this violation."
599,18," Gurrobat explains that the non-existence of a hotel that distributes one-hundred percent of its service charge income to its 
service employees, rather than disclosing its practice to customers, does not preclude employees from asserting an UMOC 
claim. He elaborates: The issue here is the effect on fair competition, not the effect on other cheaters. The lower court apparently assumed that 
there must first be a law-compliant hotel in order for anyone to have a claim for unfair methods of competition. However, in 
a market where everyone is engaged in the same unfair method of competition, there will be no ""victims"" other than 
consumers and workers."
599,19," Defendants argue that Gurrobat's HRS § 480-13(a) claim was based on theoretical injury to hypothetical competitors, his 
allegation that the entire hotel industry engaged in the same service charge distribution  [***39] practices indicated that there 
was no harm to competition, and his arguments for imposing liability under HRS § 480-13(a) were contrary to Davis, which 
rejected the position that a per se violation of HRS § 481B-14 was sufficient to allege an UMOC claim."
599,20," Defendants contend: At best, Gurrobat had two experts who opined in the abstract that, generally, hotels and banquet providers that do not 
disclose service charge distribution policies hold a ""competitive advantage"" over those who either make such a disclosure 
or pay the entirety of the service charges to the service employees. Neither expert offered any opinion as to how such a 
competitive advantage harmed the plaintiffs in this case. "
601,21," Gurrobat had standing to bring claims against both HTH Corporation and Pacific Beach Corporation because they operated 
the Pacific Beach Hotel, at which Gurrobat was employed. The issue raised by Defendants, however, is whether Gurrobat could 
adequately represent class members at the Pagoda Hotel, which was only operated by HTH Corporation."
601,22," To the extent  [***46] that any differences may exist between the percentage of the service charge withheld or the entity 
responsible for managing each hotel, such differences might affect the amount individual class members are entitled to recover 
or the respective liability of each Defendant, but not Defendants' liability or the conduct giving rise to that liability. "
604,23," Gurrobat cites a September 20, 2010 settlement conference statement in support of his contention that HTH Corporation and 
Pacific Beach Corporation together operate the Pagoda Hotel. As Defendants argue on appeal, however, this appears to be a 
mistake because it was inconsistent with Defendants' prior statements that Pacific Beach Corporation operated the Pacific 
Beach Hotel but not the Pagoda Hotel."
604,24," We reach this conclusion regardless of whether liability is based on Defendants' contractual obligation to pay employees, or 
any tortious conduct in intentionally withholding wages in violation of HRS Chapter 388."
604,25," Exhibit 9 to Gurrobat's motion for summary judgment as to damages summarized managers' share of service charge income 
at each of the hotels per year, and calculated a total of $1,678,783 based on an award of double damages with 6% interest 
compounded annually. In order to determine Pacific Beach Corporation's joint and several liability as to wages withheld at the 
Pacific Beach Hotel, the court would need to subtract that portion of damages arising from conduct at the Pagoda Hotel. "
608,26," Gurrobat asserted: ""These unfair competitive advantages were gained by Defendants at the direct expense of Plaintiff and 
other members of the Class, and Plaintiff and the Class members were injured as a result of Defendants' unfair method of 
competition and the Defendants' unfair competitive behavior in the hotel food and beverage market."" "
609,1," HRS § 481B-14 provides as follows: § 481B-14 Hotel or restaurant service charge; disposition Any hotel or restaurant that applies a service charge for the sale of food or beverage services shall distribute the service 
charge directly to its employees as tip income or clearly disclose to the purchaser of the services that the service charge is 
being used to pay for costs or expenses other than wages and tips of employees. (Emphasis added). "
610,2," HRS § 481B-4 provides as follows: § 481B-4 Remedies Any person who violates this chapter shall be deemed to have engaged in an unfair method of competition and unfair or 
deceptive act or practice in the conduct of any trade or commerce within the meaning of section 480-2. (Emphases  [***76] added)."
610,3," HRS § 480-2 provides in relevant part as follows: § 480-2 Unfair competition, practices, declared unlawful (a) Unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are 
unlawful. . . . (d) No person other than a consumer, the attorney general, or the director of the office of consumer protection may bring an 
action based upon unfair or deceptive acts or practices declared unlawful by this section (e) Any person may bring an action based on unfair methods of competition declared unlawful by this section. (Emphasis added.)"
610,4," HRS § 480-13 provides in relevant part as follows: § 480-13 Suits by persons injured; amount of recovery; injunctions (a) Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c), any person who is injured in the person's business or property by reason 
of anything forbidden or declared unlawful by this chapter: (1) May sue for damages sustained by the person and, if the judgment is for the plaintiff, the plaintiff shall be awarded a 
sum not less than $1,000 or threefold damages by the plaintiff sustained, whichever sum is the greater . . . (Emphases added.)"
610,5," I agree with the majority that the court did not err in certifying  [***77] this as a class action, that Gurrobat was entitled to double 
damages under HRS § 388-10, that the court erred in holding Pacific Beach Corporation jointly and severally liable, and that 
HTH Corporation was correctly classified as an employer. "
611,6," I also agree with the majority that Defendants were not entitled to retain a portion of service charges to supplement the income 
of managerial employees.  [***79] Instead, Defendants were ""required to distribute one hundred percent of the service charge 
income to non-management service employees[.]"" Majority opinion at 42. Thus, the distribution of the service charge to 
managerial employees, without informing consumers, violated HRS § 481B-14. See id."
611,7," Brewbaker stated that ""[u]ltimately, effective wages have to equilibrate — all [hotels] paying the same effective wage[.]"" 
Brewbaker also related that this process of equilibration would involve the non-compliant firms ""taking from everybody else who 
is compliant . . . a small amount that adds up to the cheater's economic rent."" It is therefore unclear from Brewbaker's report whether the benefits to the non-compliant firm would remain once a new 
equilibrium is  [***81] reached. However, inasmuch as Brewbaker stated that eventually, all hotels would have to pay the same 
effective wage, it would appear that the benefits to the non-compliant hotel are temporary. "
612,8," Brewbaker also stated that during the ""ensuing adjustment process it is possible . . . for persistent economic rents to arise from 
cheating, at the expense of other [hotels'] returns."" (Emphasis added.) However, Brewbaker did not explain how the competitive 
advantage gained by the non law-compliant hotels would impact the returns of the other hotels."
612,9," Tatibouet did not explain how the competitive advantage would translate into decreased revenues and profits for hotels that 
obey HRS § 481B-14. Inasmuch as Tatibouet stated that Hawai'i consumers are ""price sensitive,"" he may have assumed that 
law-compliant hotels would lose income due to price competition. "
613,10," The concurring and dissenting opinion in Villon cited Rodriguez v. Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc., CV. No. 09-
00016 DAE-LEK, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 143698, 2010 WL 8938524 (D. Haw. Dec. 29, 2010) [***88]  (Ezra, J.), Wadsworth v.

122009, 2011 WL 5025521 (D. Haw. Oct. 20, 2011) (Gillmor, J.), as cases either dismissing the plaintiff's HRS § 481B-14 claims 
brought through HRS §§ 480-2 and 480-13 or granting summary judgment against the plaintiff on such claims. 130 Hawai'i at 
149, 306 P.3d at 194 (Acoba, J., concurring and dissenting). "
614,11," The Davis majority and the majority opinion in Villon reached a similar conclusion regarding the legislative history of HRS § 
481B-14. The majority opinion in Villon stated that ""throughout [HRS § 481B-14's] journey through the legislature, the concern 
for employees was never abandoned,"" and further stated that ""[w]e have previously recognized that 'the legislative history of 
H.B. 2123 indicates that the legislature was concerned that when a hotel or restaurant withholds a service charge without 
disclosing to consumers that it is doing so, both employees and consumers can be negatively impacted."" Villon, 130 Hawai'i at 
139-140, 306 P.3d at 184-84 (quoting Davis, 122 Hawai'i at 434, 228 P.3d at 314) (emphasis in original). Nevertheless, neither 
Davis nor the majority herein acknowledge the conflict between the recognition that the purposes of HRS § 481B-14 were 
broader than the promotion of competition and the requirement  [***90] in Davis that plaintiffs allege the ""nature of the 
competition."" As explained supra and infra, because the purposes of HRS § 481B-14 transcend the protection of competition, 
there is no reason to require employees, who the legislature intended to protect, to show harm to competition to sue under HRS 
§§ 480-2 and 480-13."
614,12," Significantly, even some federal courts do not require plaintiffs to allege that they were harmed by a ""competition reducing 
aspect of the defendant's behavior"" to demonstrate ""antitrust injury"" when an action based on section 4 of the Clayton Act is 
derived from a statute ""whose purpose transcends the protection of competition."" Villon, 130 Hawai'i at 148, 306 P.3d at 193; 
see also, e.g., In Town Hotels Ltd. P'ship v. Marriott Int'l, Inc., 246 F. Supp. 2d 469, 476 (S.D.W. Va. 2003). Similarly, a leading 
antitrust treatise suggests that it is unnecessary to show injury to competition under such circumstances 2A Areeda et al., 
Antitrust Law § 359 (3d ed. 2007) (""When a plaintiff is one of those that the statute would protect from an alleged violation that 
does not depend on actual injury to competition, the plaintiff suffers antitrust injury and may recover without showing a detriment 
 [***91] to the market."" (emphasis added)). "
615,13," In a vertical price-fixing scheme, the supplier of a product, i.e., gasoline, sets constraints on the price that retailers of that 
product, i.e., gas stations, can set when they sell the product to consumers. See State Oil v. Khan, 522 U.S. 3, 15, 118 S. Ct. 
275, 139 L. Ed. 2d 199 (1997). In a vertical maximum price-fixing scheme, the supplier informs retailers that they cannot sell a 
product above a set maximum price. "
617,14," However, the majority opinion also appears to state that such a showing is required inasmuch as the majority states that 
Gurrobat was required to show that his injury ""flows from the defendant's conduct that negatively affects competition or harms 
fair competition."" Majority opinion at 60 (emphasis added)."
617,15, Brunswick did not discuss whether this was actually sufficient to show a negative effect on competition. 
618,16," The majority argues that it is not necessary for Gurrobat to prove that the Defendants ""lowered their prices or that [the 
Defendants'] conduct injured other hotels[,]"" but only that Defendants' ""conduct is harmful to fair competition."" Majority opinion at 
58. However, it is not indicated how Defendants' conduct affected ""fair competition"" other than that Defendants' conduct ""allowed 
them to charge lower base prices than law-compliant competitors."" Majority opinion at 57-58."
618,17," In doing so the majority relies on Davis' requirement of demonstrating a ""negative affect on competition,"" and on harm to ""fair 
competition"" addressed in the discussion supra."
618,18," The majority contends that there are ""no issues with respect to"" whether Gurrobat demonstrated a negative effect on 
competition. Majority opinion at 62. However, on any future motion for summary judgment or at trial, Defendants will be entitled 
to obtain opposing expert testimony. Thus, such issues may become apparent during the proceedings on remand. "

material facts. For ease of reference, the court will cite to the last four (4) digits of the Bates stamp pagination on the respective 
exhibits of the parties. All other citations, e.g. to the parties' briefs or the court's prior memoranda, will reflect the document's 
original wordprocessing pagination. "
652,6," Plaintiffs dispute this fact but offer no evidence to controvert the documents and testimony establishing it. (See Doc. 1296-1 at 
¶ 137)."
652,7," Although Nestlé ranks third among the major manufacturers in the U.S., the Nestlé brand has substantial market power abroad, 
and it is the market leader in Canada. (Doc. 1296-1 at ¶ 356)."
652,8," The individual purchaser plaintiffs have offered no evidentiary response to arguments raised by Mars with respect to future 
consumption products. Implicit from the court's narrowing of the certified class and, more pertinently, from both plaintiff groups' 
proof and arguments, is the abandonment of any claims related to future consumption products. Although the court is unaware 
of any formal withdrawal of these claims,  [**51] the fact remains that proof in this matter has been tailored to single and king 
size bars to the exclusion of any future consumption products. Consequently, the court deems claims related to future 
consumption products to be withdrawn and focuses its analysis solely on single and king size bars. "
656,9," Nestlé emphasizes that its 2002 increase did not mirror its competitors' increase and instead was 0.2 cents per bar lower. Such 
a slight differential between increases, however, is de minimis and not dispositive to the court's parallel pricing analysis. Baby 
Food, 166 F.3d at 132 (observing that precise parallel pricing is not required to sustain Section 1 claim). "
658,10," Defendants do not dispute the vast majority of Dr. Vellturo's market factor conclusions, with the exception of his finding that 
""actual"" raw material costs declined during the conspiracy period. The court will address this dispute infra."
658,11," Defendants largely concede this point, offering cursory argument with respect to minor variations in their respective market 
shares, (Doc. 1222 at 28-29 (Mars contending that share shifts between defendants indicate competition rather than collusion), 
and product differentiation (id. at 27-28 (Mars contending that differentiation rather than standardization rendered market hostile 
to collusive behavior); Doc. 1319 at 23 (Nestlé positing that heavy branding and marketing symbols belie plaintiffs' contention 
that chocolate products are largely fungible)). "
659,12, See infra at pp. 32-37.
659,13," Nestlé's market share fluctuated only minimally during the conspiracy period, resting within the 8.0 to 8.3 percent range. 
(Vellturo Rep. at Ex. 6-A). "
660,14," Even if costs were stable or demand was in decline during the conspiracy period, pricing action without consideration of 
changes in cost does not, by itself, tend to disprove the possibility of independent and self-interested conduct. See, e.g., Brooke 
Group, 509 U.S. at 213 (observing that industry increasing prices in lockstep, twice a year and ""irrespective of the rate of 
inflation, changes in the costs of production, or shifts in consumer demand,"" does not prove  [**84] conspiracy but only that ""the 
industry reaped the benefits of prices above a competitive level, though not through unlawful conduct. . .""). "
662,15," Plaintiffs dispute whether costs actually motivated defendants' pricing discussions, but they do not dispute the fact that 
defendants were actively engaged in internal analyses. (Doc. 1296 at ¶ 440). "
663,16," No one factor is dispositive to an antitrust claim. Thus,  [**96] if plaintiffs present sufficient evidence indicative of a traditional 
conspiracy under the third plus factor, they may survive summary judgment despite failing to establish other factors. See Flat 
Glass, 385 F.3d at 361. "
664,17," The court notes with interest that Dr. Vellturo's threshold statement speaks inchoately of close interrelations which ""indicate"" 
that ""anti-competitive practices . . . in one market could likely serve as facilitating devices . . . for collusive outcomes in the 
other."" (Vellturo Rep. at ¶ 203 (emphasis added)). Despite the myriad contingencies in this preliminary observation, Dr. Vellturo 
abruptly follows with the sweeping conclusion that the ""extensive interactions between the United States and Canadian 
operations . . . did serve as a facilitating device that actuated"" defendants' price-fixing conspiracy. (Id. (emphasis added)). This 
conclusion is a house of cards that is wholly contingent upon factual  [**100] proof of ""extensive interactions"" between domestic 
and Canadian affiliates. In the absence of such factual proof, the house of cards necessarily collapses. See infra at pp. 44-47. "
665,18," At oral argument, plaintiffs' counsel inventively portrayed the evidence as follows: It goes on a spectrum from we were aware that there was coordination in Canada and didn't put a stop to it because it 
helped us to coordinate our prices in the United States . . . and when you have that kind of conduct by the U.S. executives 
who have pricing authority, that kind of awareness at a minimum, and that kind of direction at a maximum, I think a jury can 
easily conclude, as Dr. Vellturo points out, that they use Canada as a facilitating device. That is they used it to shape the 
expectations of U.S. executives that pricing should be followed. (Tr. at 83:15-84:5; also id. at 90:15-22 (""You have the U.S. executives at a minimum aware of what's going on in Canada and at 
a maximum directing it, and Dr. Vellturo says that is a perfect facilitating device to give comfort to, give assurances that U.S. 
price increases would be followed."")). "
666,19," The development of a thorough summary judgment record has illuminated and underscored material differences between 
what occurred in Canada and what plaintiffs allege sub judice. The Canadian conduct involved concerted managerial efforts to 
curb transaction-level trade spend promotional practices. (See Doc. 1296-1 at 12-15). In contrast, the domestic conduct 
challenged by plaintiffs pertains to three list pricing decisions. The Canadian and domestic behaviors are fundamentally distinct, 
and plaintiffs do not point to any  [**107] relevant similarities which would be probative of plaintiffs' claims. Given this further 
attenuation, the evidence does not support the inference urged by plaintiffs: that the initial success of a trade spend conspiracy 
in Canada assured the defendants that a domestic price-fixing conspiracy would succeed. For this additional reason, the court 
rejects plaintiffs' actuation theory as applied to this case."
666,20," Plaintiffs emphasize that this court has previously ruled that their allegations with respect to domestic market conditions 
contemporaneous with the explicit collusion in Canada ""raise an inference of plausibility [of concerted action] when juxtaposed 
with parallel conduct."" (Doc. 1296 at 90 (quoting In re Chocolate Confectionary Antitrust Litig., 602 F. Supp. 2d 538, 576 (M.D. 
Pa. Mar. 4, 2009)). Plaintiffs accurately cite this court's holding. That decision, however, was rendered at the Rule 12(b)(6) 
stage, when plaintiffs' allegations of executive-level communications between the defendants and their Canadian counterparts 
with respect to pricing were assumed true. See In re Chocolate, 602 F. Supp. 2d at 555 (noting that the court must accept 
plaintiffs' factual allegations as true  [**108] at Rule 12 stage). Plaintiffs cannot simply fall back on the court's Rule 12 
determination to cure the infirmities in the present Rule 56 record. Plaintiffs must now produce record evidence tending to 
establish that the allegations upon which the court earlier relied are true. "
668,21," In previous submissions, plaintiffs have claimed that a proposed sale of Hershey to Nestlé S.A. (in addition to a licensing 
agreement between those parties) created ample  [**117] opportunities to conspire. (See Doc. 421 at ¶ 104(g)). This argument 
is notably absent from plaintiffs' Rule 56 submissions, suggesting that the theory has been abandoned. (See Doc. 1296 at 91 
(failing to respond to defendants' argument with respect to licensing agreement or Hershey sale theories); Doc. 1454 at 50-52 
(same)). In the exercise of caution, the court notes that plaintiffs have adduced no additional evidence tending to establish that a 
conspiratorial agreement flowed from otherwise ordinary and legitimate business contacts. See, e.g., Baby Food, 166 F.3d at 
133; Petruzzi, 998 F.2d at 1242 n.15; Tose, 648 F.2d at 894; Fragale, 760 F.2d at 473. "
669,22, The court again commends counsel for their exemplary and diligent efforts throughout all phases of this litigation. 
672,1," The following facts are taken from Fido's complaint and are assumed to be true for purposes of this motion. See Ashcroft v. 
Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009)."
672,2," The facts recited here are taken from the various pleadings, court orders, and other court records from prior litigation submitted 
with the parties' briefing on this motion. Although these matters are outside the confines of the Fido's complaint, I take judicial "
673,," notice of these facts ""not for the truth of the matters asserted in the other litigation, but rather to establish the fact of such 
litigation and related filings."" Kramer v. Time Warner Inc., 937 F.2d 767, 774 (2d Cir. 1991). "
674,3," Fido's sells electronic pet containment systems manufactured by DogWatch, a competitor of Invisible Fence and RSC (see 
Compl. ¶ 10), but it never argues that its status as a seller of DogWatch products gives it either Article III or antitrust standing to 
bring claims related to defendants' alleged monopolization of the market for such systems. "
675,4," Plaintiff refers to replacement batteries for electronic pet containment systems as a ""submarket"" of the alleged market for 
electronic pet containment systems. For purposes of this motion, this opinion assumes, without deciding, that replacement 
batteries for electronic pet containment systems may constitute a distinct and independent product market for antitrust purposes. "
679,5," The parties did not engage in a claim by claim analysis of the preclusive effect of plaintiff's voluntary dismissal with prejudice of 
the Qui Tam Action. Plaintiff should be prepared to address at the next conference why its claim for injunctive relief for patent 
mismarking (Count VII) should not be dismissed on res judicata grounds. See Scherer v. Equitable Life Assurance Soc'y of the 
United States, 347 F.3d 394, 398 n.4 (2d Cir. 2003) (""[A] court is free to raise [res judicata] sua sponte, even if the parties have 
seemingly waived it.""). "
683,1, See  [*4] footnote 37. 
684,2, Citations to the record are provided only for direct quotations. The majority of the facts are taken directly from the complaint.
684,3," Because a proper understanding of the facts entails an understanding of the statutory and regulatory framework, it is 
summarized here as well as addressed in the discussion section."
684,4," The cited statutes, Massachusetts General Laws chapter 392 (1930) (""chapter 392"") and Massachusetts General Laws chapter 
386 (1963) (""chapter 386""), are set out in Appendix I to Rule 403, which Uber filed as an exhibit to the motion. (Docket Entry # 6-
3). Neither Uber nor plaintiffs maintain that the statutes, as set out in the appendix, are not current for present purposes or do 
not apply to the case at bar. "
685,5," ""Local regulations,"" such as ordinances, ""are presumed valid, unless they exceed the authority conferred by the enabling 
statute or the Home Rule Amendment (art. 89 of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution)."" Springfield Preservation 
Trust, Inc. v. Springfield Library and Museums Association, Inc., 447 Mass. 408, 852 N.E.2d 83, 92 (Mass. 2006) (examining 
validity of ordinance)."
685,6," At all times, however, the Commissioner must operate within the limits imposed by the enabling statue. See Town Taxi Inc. v. 
Police Commissioner of Boston, 387 N.E.2d at 132-133 (""[u]nless, however, the Commissioner exceeded the authority ""'from 
time to time (to) fix maximum and minimum rates' delegated to him . . . , there can be no objection that he has usurped 
legislative power""); Cambridge Taxi Co. v. City Manager of Cambridge, 322 Mass. 108, 76 N.E.2d 135, 136 (Mass.1947) 
(""[t]here is nothing in the statute . . . limiting the power of the city or town to the fixing of maximum rates"" of taxicab fares"" 
thereby allowing city ""to enact the ordinance fixing the single rate"" for all taxicab operators). He must also exercise his authority 
and discretion ""to effectuate the purposes of the statute."" Lynch v. Police Commissioner of Boston, 681 N.E.2d at 310. "
686,7," See Mass. Gen. L. ch. 90, § 22F."
686,8," The Commissioner designated an enforcement unit known as the Hackney Carriage Unit to enforce the regulations. The unit is 
""[a]lso known as the Office of the Inspector of Carriages."" (Docket Entry # 6-3). An applicant may appeal a denial of a medallion to the Director of Licensing. The Director of Licensing then makes a 
recommendation on the appeal to the Commissioner. Subject to complying with the time limits in Rule 403, an aggrieved 
applicant may seek relief in  [*15] a court of competent jurisdiction."
686,9," The relevant provisions of Rule 403 require radio association members to display the ""Radio Association's color scheme as 
approved by the Inspector of Carriages"" on their hackney carriage. (Docket Entry # 6-3). The rule similarly requires that, ""All 
taxis must be painted in approved Radio Association markings and colors"" except for certain grand fathered vehicles in a 1998 
agreement. (Docket Entry # 6-3). Rule 403 further states that, ""All radio association colors, markings, designs, decal or logos 
must be approved by the Inspector of Carriages, as required by the Hackney Rules."" (Docket Entry # 6-3). "
687,10," Uber therefore argues that it is not using any Boston Cab ""logo on a Partner's vehicle under the Lanham Act."" (Docket Entry # 
6). Similarly, because it does not own the vehicles, medallions or radio associations, it does not ""'have charge of a hackney 
carriage'"" within the meaning of chapter 392, chapter 386 or ordinance 16-15.05, according to Uber. (Docket  [*20] Entry # 19)."
687,11," The complaint also describes the method as calculated by ""[t]he Uber GPS system."" (Docket Entry # 1-1, ¶ 47). The global 
positioning system (""GPS"") ""calculates fares with a 'rate meter,' and fares are 'charged based upon miles traveled."" (Docket "
688,," Entry # 1-1, ¶ 47) (brackets omitted). Approved radio associations use a GPS system that allows them as well as ""the 
 [*21] Boston police to track every taxi all the time."" (Docket Entry # 1-1, ¶ 51). "
690,12," Rule 403 explains that a decal is ""affixed to locations on the taxi indicating the vehicle is an official Boston Licensed 
 [*30] hackney carriage."" (Docket Entry # 6-3, § 3)."
690,13," Paragraph 42 sets out ""Uber's illegal transportation system"" with respect to Uber Taxis. (Docket Entry # 1-1, ¶ 42). The bulk of 
the complaint targets the conduct of Uber Black Cars and Uber SUVs. The only allegation specific to Count I is the false 
representation that Uber Taxis are operating lawfully. (Docket Entry # 1-1, ¶ 60). To the extent the complaint sets out other false 
or misleading  [*31] statements in Uber's commercial advertising or promotion, it was incumbent upon plaintiffs to identify them 
in response to Uber's argument. Plaintiffs only identify Uber's single option credit card payment system and the gratuity and 
$1.00 fee (Docket Entry # 1-1, ¶¶ 33 & 34-38) (Docket Entry # 14, p. 20) also noted in paragraph 42. Thus, insofar as the 
complaint identifies additional false or misleading statements in Uber's commercial advertisements or promotions beyond those 
in paragraphs 33, 34 to 38 and 42, the issue is waived as a basis for liability under section 43(a)(1)(B). See O'Connell v. 
Marrero-Recio, 724 F.3d at 124 (district court ""had no reason to factor into its analysis of O'Connell's retaliation claim the 
allegations concerning her participation in the NPP's primary elections"" because O'Connell's brief did not premise the claim on 
this allegation); Higgins v. New Balance Athletic Shoe, Inc., 194 F.3d at 260 (""district court is free to disregard arguments that 
are not adequately developed""); see also U.S. v. Caparotta, 676 F.3d at 218 (""argument consist[ing] of just two sentences and 
two cursory citations in his brief . . . is therefore waived""). "
691,14," The rule also prevents a driver from refusing ""to accept a credit  [*33] card as payment."" (Docket Entry # 6-3, § 5, ¶ II(bb)). 
The complaint adds that Boston taxicab drivers must also accept cash. (Docket Entry # 1-1, ¶¶ 33 & 59). "
692,15," As discussed below, the gratuity representation also raises a literally false claim that Uber Taxi drivers approve the gratuity 
and that the drivers receive a 20% gratuity."
692,16," The complaint at issue in Clorox recited the results of a consumer survey which the lower court did not properly credit. Clorox 
Co. Puerto Rico v. Proctor & Gamble Commercial Co., 228 F.3d at 37 (reversing dismissal of section 43(a)(1)(B) claim)."
692,17," In order to constitute ""commercial advertising or promotion"" under section 43(a)(1)(B): a representation must (a) constitute commercial speech (b) made with the intent of influencing potential customers to 
purchase the speaker's goods or services (c) by a speaker who is a competitor of the plaintiff in some line of trade or 
commerce and (d) disseminated to the consuming public in such a way as to constitute ""advertising"" or ""promotion."" Podiatrist Association Inc. v. La Cruz Azul De Puerto Rico, Inc., 332 F.3d at 19. "
694,18," Although Beacon addressed a Lanham Act section 43(a)(1)(A) claim, the statutory language (""he or she is likely to be 
damaged by such act"") prefaces both subparagraphs (a)(1)(A) and (a)(1)(B)."
694,19, The alleged diversion of fares and revenue in the complaint is not made in reference to the 20% gratuity.
694,20, See footnote 12. 
696,21," See 15 U.S.C. § 1127 (defining ""mark"" as including any trademark, service mark, collective mark, or certification mark""). "
697,22," Case law nevertheless deems the ""in commerce"" requirement satisfied when ""the plaintiff used its mark in interstate 
commerce and the defendant's infringement damages plaintiff's interstate reputation."" 5 J. Thomas McCarthy, McCarthy on 
Trademarks and Unfair Competition § 27:47 (2013) (emphasis in original) (citing Johnson v. Jones, 149 F.3d 494, 502 (6th Cir. 
1998), in footnote). Thus, as stated in a 2003 First Circuit case in finding that the plaintiff made only ""meager showings of 
commerce and harm,"" there was ""no evidence in the record that Danielson even  [*57] operated outside Massachusetts at this 
time, in order to establish the necessary interstate commerce nexus for the market in which business was allegedly lost."" John 
G. Danielson, Inc. v. Winchester-Conant Properties, Inc., 322 F.3d 26, 46 (1st Cir. 2003) (citing Johnson v. Jones, 149 F.3d at 
502)."
697,23," Plaintiffs identify these statements (Docket Entry # 1-1, ¶¶ 80-81) as satisfying the ""in commerce"" requirement. (Docket Entry 
# 14). Although Count II (Docket Entry # 1-1, ¶¶ 1-61) does not expressly incorporate these statements (Docket Entry # 1-1, ¶¶ 
80-81), Uber had  [*58] the opportunity to object to their consideration in the reply brief and failed to address the issue. See 
O'Connell v. Marrero-Recio, 724 F.3d at 124; Higgins v. New Balance Athletic Shoe, Inc., 194 F.3d at 260."
697,24," Although the complaint does not expressly state that Uber's internet transmissions include those made outside 
Massachusetts, a reasonable inference of such use arises by use of the internet. "
698,25," Uber does not distinguish between EJT and Boston Cab. It simply asserts that ""plaintiffs"" fail to cite evidence of consumer 
confusion. (Docket Entry ## 6 & 19). Uber also seeks to dismiss the entire claim as opposed to the claim with respect to EJT or 
Boston Cab. Uber's failure to distinguish between EJT and Boston Cab regarding the arguments waives the argument that the 
claims against EJT as opposed to Boston Cab is subject to dismissal. See O'Connell v. Marrero-Recio, 724 F.3d at 124; Higgins 
v. New Balance Athletic Shoe, Inc., 194 F.3d at 260. "
699,26," Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. v. Tabari, 610 F.3d 1171, 1175-76 (9th Cir. 2010); Century 21 Real Estate Corp. v. 
LendingTree, Inc., 425 F.3d at 222. "
700,27, See the previous footnote.
700,28," Plaintiffs made this statement to address Uber's RICO argument that they do not allege harm from the investment of funds 
derived from the wire fraud. A RICO injury, see George v. National Water Main Cleaning Co., 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 31858, 
2011 WL 841226, at *13 (D.Mass. March 23, 2011), differs from a Lanham Act injury, which may include a lessening of goodwill 
or an injury to the plaintiffs' reputation. See Beacon Mut. Ins. Co. v. OneBeacon Ins. Group, 376 F.3d at 15;  [*72] Cashmere & 
Camel Hair Manufacturers Institute v. Saks Fifth Ave., 284 F.3d at 311. Because of the context in which plaintiffs made the 
statement and the differing legal principles, Uber's reliance on the statement is unsound. "
702,29," Two district court cases cite to Dial A Car only in relation to the court's Sherman Act analysis. See CCBN.Com, Inc. v. 
Thomson Financial, Inc., 270 F.Supp.2d 146, 155 (D.Mass. 2003); Wojcieszek v. New England Tel. and Tel. Co., 977 F.Supp. 
527, 533-534 (D.Mass. 1997)."
702,30," The Schering-Plough court articulates the nature of the argument as based on the  [*78] principle of primary jurisdiction. 
Schering-Plough Healthcare Products, Inc. v. Schwarz Pharma, Inc., 586 F.3d at 507."
702,31, Decisions by the Inspector of Carriages with respect to hackney carriage violations for vehicle deficiencies are final. 
703,32," Uber does not raise or seek dismissal based on Burford v. Sun Oil Co., 319 U.S. 315, 63 S. Ct. 1098, 87 L. Ed. 1424 (1943). 
See O'Connell v. Marrero-Recio, 724 F.3d at 124; Higgins v. New Balance Athletic Shoe, Inc., 194 F.3d at 260. Uber does not 
cite to Burford or to any of its progeny and Uber discusses only Dial A Car, a case that did not cite or mention abstention on the 
basis of Burford."
703,33, Uber did not present an argument based on federal preemption of the state law claims. 
704,34," The complaint identifies three other allegations specific to Count III. (Docket Entry # 1-1, ¶ 66(b)-66(d)); see fn. 39."
704,35," The ""crucial factors"" to determine whether an act or practice is ""unfair"" are ""the nature of challenged conduct"" as well as the 
""purpose and effect of that conduct."" Massachusetts Employers Ins. Exchange v. Propac-Mass, Inc., 420 Mass. 39, 648 N.E.2d 
435, 438 (Mass. 1995) (also noting as ""uninstructive"" the language ""'level of rascality'"" and ""'rancid flavor of unfairness'""). 
Examining the circumstances, ""An act or practice is 'unfair' if it is 'within at least the penumbra of some common-law, statutory or 
other established concept of unfairness,' is 'immoral, unethical, oppressive, or unscrupulous,' and 'causes substantial injury to 
consumers (or competitors or other businessmen).'"" In re Pharmaceutical Industry Average Wholesale Price Litigation, 582 F.3d 
at 184; Massachusetts Employers Ins. Exchange v. Propac-Mass, Inc., 648 N.E.2d at 438."
704,36, The plaintiff also sought class action status. Id. at 457-458.
704,37," On appeal, the First Circuit explained  [*87] the distinction between constitutional and statutory standing. Katz v. Pershing, 
LLC, 672 F.3d 64, 75 (1st Cir. 2012). The latter turns upon whether ""the statute gives that plaintiff authority to sue."" Id.; see Steel 
Co. v. Citizens for a Better Environment, 523 U.S. 83, 92, 118 S. Ct. 1003, 140 L. Ed. 2d 210 (1998) (implying that ""whether 
EPCRA authorizes this plaintiff to sue"" presents issue of statutory standing); In re American River Transp. Co., 728 F.3d 839, 
846 (8th Cir. 2013) (statutory standing asks ""'whether this plaintiff has a cause of action under the statute'""); see also Northwest 
Airlines, Inc. v. County of Kent, Mich., 510 U.S. 355, 365, 114 S. Ct. 855, 127 L. Ed. 2d 183 (1994) (whether federal statute 
creates private right of action ""is not jurisdictional""). ""[S]tatutory standing goes to the merits of the claim"" whereas constitutional 
""standing presents a question of justiciability; if it is lacking, a federal court has no subject matter jurisdiction over the claim."" 
Katz v. Pershing, LLC, 672 F.3d at 75; see Steel Co., 523 U.S. at 97 n.2. "
705,38," Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93H (""chapter 93H"")."
705,39," The four allegedly unfair or deceptive acts or practices identified in the paragraph  [*90] specific to Count III are: (a) Falsely claiming an affiliation with medallion owners and radio associations; (b) Falsely claiming that it only collects a $ 1 fee and pays the full 20% ""gratuity"" to taxi drivers; (c) Falsely claiming that its taxi service is lawful under Boston Taxi Rules; (d) Falsely claiming that its Black Cars, SUVs and UberX vehicles do not need to be licensed and regulated as taxis in 
Boston. (Docket Entry # 1-1, ¶ 66)."
705,40," This court is not making the converse finding that if a showing was required, it would preclude the chapter 93A claim."
705,41," Uber raises a new argument in the reply brief seeking to dismiss Count III because plaintiffs offer no cognizable  [*91] theory 
of harm regarding the chapter 93A claim based on the gratuity. (Docket Entry # 19). Uber presents the argument in a single 
sentence bereft of any developed argument. The argument is therefore waived with respect to the present motion. See U.S. v. 
Caparotta, 676 F.3d at 218 (""argument consist[ing] of just two sentences and two cursory citations in his brief . . . is therefore 
waived""); U.S. v. Pizarro-Berrios, 448 F.3d 1, 5-6 (1st Cir. 2006) (""[w]e have consistently held that, except in extraordinary 
circumstances, arguments not raised in a party's initial brief and instead raised for the first time at oral argument are considered 
waived""); Higgins v. New Balance Athletic Shoe, Inc., 194 F.3d at 260 (""district court is free to disregard arguments that are not 
adequately developed""); see also CMM Cable Rep., Inc. v. Ocean Coast Properties, Inc., 97 F.3d 1504, 1526 (1st Cir. 1996) "
706,," (courts are ""entitled to expect represented parties to incorporate all relevant arguments in the papers that directly address a 
pending motion"")."
706,42," The above allegation is one of the two identified means by which Uber competes unfairly in Count IV. The other allegation 
(diverting credit card processing fees) fails for lack of injury under section 11. Accordingly, the allegation is not addressed with 
respect to Uber's argument that Rule 403 and chapters 392 and 386 occupy the field thereby precluding a chapter 93A claim."
706,43," Somewhat different concerns apply to this argument when it seeks to preclude the state law cause of action as opposed to the 
federal law cause of action."
706,44," A statutory amendment to chapter 93A after the Dodd decision overrode the decision's ""restrictive interpretation"" of the 
plaintiffs ""who could bring private causes of action for unfair insurance claim settlement practices."" Hopkins v. Liberty Mut. Ins. 
Co., 434 Mass. 556, 750 N.E.2d 943, 950 n.12 (Mass. 2001) (discussing Dodd). "
707,45," The SJC in Hershenow contrasted the Cabot and Reiter decisions, which found preclusion, with Dodd, which allowed the 
chapter 93A claim, in a manner indicative of finding that a statute is more likely to occupy the field when it allows a private right 
of action and embodies limited remedies. The relevant citations to Cabot, Reiter and Dodd are as follows: Contrast Cabot Corp. v. Baddour, 394 Mass. 720, 722-723, 725, 477 N.E.2d 399 (1985) (Uniform Securities Act intended to 
provide comprehensive regulation of securities field, and distinguishing Dodd v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., supra, where 
absence of private actions established that insurance field not comprehensively regulated);  [*98] Reiter Oldsmobile, Inc. v. 
General Motors Corp., 378 Mass. 707, 711, 393 N.E.2d 376 (1979) (G.L. c. 93B, which addresses unfairness in dealings in 
the automotive industry, provided specific private remedies for violation, so no relief available under G.L. c. 93A). Hershenow v. Enterprise Rent-A-Car Company Of Boston, Inc., 840 N.E.2d at 532."
707,46," Likewise the SJC in Cabot contrasted the decisions in Reiter and Dodd to note that an absence of private right of action 
indicates a lack of comprehensive regulation: We distinguished the result in Reiter from that reached in Dodd v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., 373 Mass. 72, 76-78, 365 
N.E.2d 802 (1977), reasoning that ""[u]nlike c. 93B, c. 176D made no provision for private actions,"" and therefore the latter 
did not comprehensively regulate unfair or deceptive insurance practices. Reiter, supra 378 Mass. at 711, 393 N.E.2d 376. Cabot Corp. v. Baddour, 477 N.E.2d at 401."
707,47," Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93B (""chapter 93B""). "
708,48," One example of the overlapping misconduct is ""falsely claiming that its black cars, SUVs and UberX vehicles do not need to 
be licensed and regulated as taxis in Boston."" (Docket Entry # 1-1, ¶ 66(d)). Establishing this premise as a violation of section 11 
entails determining if Uber is a person in ""charge of a hackney carriage"" driven by an unlicensed hackney carriage driver under 
chapters 392 and/or 386. As previously indicated, the statutory grant of authority to the Commissioner in chapter 392, section 
four,  [*101] to grant hackney carriage licences impliedly encompasses the authority to determine if Uber qualifies as an 
approved radio association."
708,49," For purposes of resolving the motion to dismiss, the facts in the complaint construed in plaintiffs' favor permit a finding that 
Uber is a person in charge of vehicles for hire operated by drivers who do not have hackney carriage licenses."
708,50," With respect to radio associations, the rule expressly sets out only the penalty of a removal of a radio association from ""the list 
of approved radio associations."" (Docket Entry # 6-3, § 7)."
708,51," It is therefore not necessary to decide dubiánte that a regulation  [*103] enacted after a statute can impliedly override the 
express cause of action in the prior statute."
708,52," Rule 403 does proscribe that only approved radio associations may accept licensed hackney carriage medallion owners as 
members. "
710,53," Uber incorrectly sets out elements of an intentional interference with an advantageous business relationship claim as opposed 
to the related tort of an intentional interference with a contract or contractual relations. Uber also misstates the motive or means 
requirement as requiring ""motive and means."" (Docket Entry # 6). "
711,54," Massachusetts cases look to the Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 766-766B (1979), for guidance in this area. See 
Blackstone v. Cashman, 448 Mass. 255, 860 N.E.2d 7, 12 (Mass. 2007). "
712,55," Plaintiffs' brief, which is not part of the Rule 12(b)(6) factual record, alleges that Uber's diversion of business has caused a 
diminution in the number of cabs leased and therefore economic harm. (Docket Entry # 14). The complaint does not state that 
EJT experienced harm in the form of reduced lease agreements as a result of Uber's interference in the lease agreements."
712,56," The recommendation to dismiss Count VI without prejudice due to the absence of harm makes it unnecessary to address 
Uber's other arguments. Uber can raise these arguments in the event plaintiffs seek leave to amend the complaint. At present, it 
is premature to address the arguments because  [*118] a proposed amended complaint might include additional facts that place 
the arguments in a different light. "
713,57," Any objections to this Report and Recommendation must be filed with the Clerk of Court within 14 days of receipt of the 
Report and Recommendation to which objection is made and the basis for such objection. See Rule 72(b), Fed. R. Civ. P. Any "

specified time waives the right to appeal the order."

722,1," They are Meredith Corporation (""Meredith""); the E.W. Scripps Company; Scripps Media, Inc.; Hoak Media, LLC; Hoak Media of

722,2," Because plaintiffs at no point identified or served any ""John Doe"" defendants, SESAC is the lone defendant to move for 
summary judgment, although the arguments it makes appear to run equally to the benefit of its ""John Doe"" affiliates. "
723,3," The Court's account of the underlying facts of this case is drawn from the parties' submissions in support of and in opposition to 
the instant motion—specifically, Defendant SESAC LLC's Statement of Undisputed Facts Pursuant to Local Rule 56.1 (""Def. 
56.1"") (Dkt. 131); Plaintiffs' Response to Defendant's Statement of Facts Pursuant to Local Rule 56.1 (""Pl. Resp. to Def. 56.1"") 
(Dkt. 134); Defendants SESAC LLC's Reply Statement to Plaintiffs' Local Rule 56.1 Responses (""Def. Reply 56.1"") (Dkt. 137); 
Plaintiffs' Local Rule 56.1 Supplemental Statement of Undisputed Facts (""Pl. 56.1"") (Dkt. 133); Defendant SESAC LLC's 
Response to Plaintiffs' Local Rule 56.1 Supplemental Statement of Undisputed  [**7] Facts (""Def. Resp. to Pl. 56.1"") (Dkt. 136); 
the Memorandum of Law in Support of Defendant SESAC LLC's Motion for Summary Judgment (""Def. Br."") (Dkt. 130); Plaintiffs' 
Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Defendant SESAC, LLC's Motion for Summary Judgment (""Pl. Br."") (Dkt. 132); the 
Corrected Reply Memorandum of Law in Support of Defendant SESAC LLC's Motion for Summary Judgment (""Def. Reply Br."") 
(Dkt. 135); the Declaration of Susan J. Kohlmann in Support of SESAC LLC's Motion for Summary Judgment (""Kohlmann Decl."") 
and accompanying exhibits; the Declaration of Eric S. Hochstadt in Support of Plaintiffs' Opposition to Defendant SESAC 3 
LLC's Motion for Summary Judgment (""Hochstadt Decl."") and accompanying exhibits; and the Supplemental Declaration of 
Susan J. Kohlmann in Further Support of SESAC LLC's Motion for Summary Judgment (""Kohlman Supp. Decl."") and 
accompanying exhibits. Citations to a party's 56.1 statement incorporate by reference the documents cited therein. Where facts 
stated in a party's 56.1 statement are supported by testimonial or documentary evidence, and denied by a conclusory statement 
by the other party without citation to conflicting testimonial or documentary evidence,  [**8] the Court finds such facts to be true. 
See S.D.N.Y. Local Rule 56.1(c) (""Each numbered paragraph in the statement of material facts set forth in the statement 
required to be served by the moving party will be deemed to be admitted for purposes of the motion unless specifically 
controverted by a correspondingly numbered paragraph in the statement required to be served by the opposing party.""); id. at 
56.1(d) (""Each statement by the movant or opponent . . . controverting any statement of material fact[ ] must be followed by 
citation to evidence which would be admissible, set forth as required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).""). The parties each challenge the other's Rule 56.1 statement. Plaintiffs attempt to justify their submission of a supplemental 
56.1 statement by arguing that SESAC ""has presented an incomplete record to the Court."" Pl. 56.1 at 1. SESAC 
characterizes plaintiffs' submission as an ""unnecessary and improper submission that distracts from the undisputed record 
of material facts set forth in SESAC's Statement of Undisputed Facts Pursuant to Local Rule 56.1""; it asks the Court to 
disregard plaintiffs' supplemental statement for several reasons. Def. Resp. to Pl. 56.1 at 1-2. SESAC  [**9] also makes 
specific objections to aspects of plaintiffs' supplemental 56.1 statement, as well as to plaintiffs' responses to SESAC's 
statement. The Court has carefully considered both parties' arguments and competing 56.1 statements. As to SESAC's 56.1 
statement, many of plaintiffs' responses consist of improper argument or recitations of different facts; where plaintiffs have 
not cited an evidentiary basis to contest a factually supported statement by SESAC, the Court has taken that statement as 
established. As to plaintiffs' supplemental 56.1 statement, the Court has found certain discrete statements related in it to be 
germane and factually supported; where defendants have not refuted these facts, the Court has taken them as true. 
However, many of plaintiffs' 56.1 statements are improper: They are argumentative or immaterial, rely on inadmissible 
hearsay, fail to cite supporting evidence, and/or marshal evidence in a manner perhaps appropriate for a legal brief, but not 
for a 56.1 statement. As to other facts, plaintiffs needlessly repackage facts adequately addressed in SESAC's 56.1 
statement. Where plaintiffs' 56.1 statement is deficient in such ways, the Court has not relied on  [**10] it. The 56.1 
statements on which the Court has relied are those cited herein. "
724,4," The Supreme Court has explained the origins of the PROs by noting that ""those who performed copyrighted music for profit 
were so numerous and widespread, and most performances so fleeting, that as a practical matter it was impossible for the many 
individual copyright holders to negotiate with and license the users and to detect unauthorized uses."" BMI v. Columbia 
Broadcasting Sys., Inc., 441 U.S. 1, 4-5, 99 S. Ct. 1551, 60 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1979) (""BMI v. CBS""). "
725,5," A television station also cannot determine the music contained in third-party produced commercials aired during such programs 
(""incidental music"") or in the background of broadcasted live events (""ambient music""). See Pl. Resp. to Def. 56.1 ¶ 7."
725,6," There are limited exceptions to this, including  [**15] in circumstances where a local station's network affiliate has obtained a 
""through to the viewer"" license from the PRO that runs to the benefit of a local affiliate. See Def. 56.1 ¶ 17; Pl. 56.1 Resp. to Def. 
56.1 ¶ 17. These circumstances are not relevant here."
725,7," There are situations in which third-party producers or syndicators directly provide source licenses that convey the public 
performance rights to the embedded music. See Pl. Resp. to Def. 56.1 ¶¶ 14, 16. This circumstance is not relevant to the instant 
motion. "
726,8," In recent years, following a decision of the Second Circuit involving BMI, see AEI, 275 F.3d at 176-77, the rate courts have 
required ASCAP and BMI to offer, in addition to an economically viable PPL, a license known as an ""adjustable fee blanket 
license,"" or AFBL. An AFBL allows the licensee to reduce its blanket license fee to reflect direct licenses it has obtained to 
perform works within the PRO's repertory. See BMI v. DMX, 683 F.3d at 40, 42-43, 46-47 (discussing AFBLs requested from 
ASCAP and BMI); see also WPIX, Inc. v. BMI, No. 09 Civ. 10366 (LLS), 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46323, 2011 WL 1630996 
(S.D.N.Y. Apr. 28, 2011); United States v. ASCAP, 309 F. Supp. 2d 566, 581 (S.D.N.Y. 2004). Most recently, ASCAP and BMI 
have been parties to rate court actions regarding the acquisition of performance rights to the works in their repertories by 
Pandora, an internet radio service provider. See BMI v. Pandora Media, Inc., No. 13 Civ. 4037 (LLS) (S.D.N.Y.); In Re Petition of 
Pandora Media Inc., No. 12 Civ. 8035 (DLC) (S.D.N.Y.). "
727,9," For 2013, in light of this pending lawsuit, SESAC maintained the status quo: It offered local stations the same license rates as 
those demanded for the 2008-2012 period. Pl. 56.1 ¶ 194. "
729,10, Both the Complaint  [**32] and the Amended Complaint contained a jury demand. 
730,11," The original reply brief submitted by SESAC inadvertently exceeded the page limits agreed to by the parties, see Dkt. 116. 
SESAC submitted a corrected reply brief. "
734,12," In support of the same outcome, the Court stated that the blanket license could be viewed as its own product, rather than the 
pooling of separate products: ""[T]o the extent the blanket license is a different product, ASCAP is not really a joint sales agency 
offering the individual goods of many sellers, but is a separate seller offering its blanket license, of which the individual 
compositions are raw material."" Id. at 22. The Court also suggested that ASCAP could be viewed as a ""[j]oint venture[],"" which is 
""not usually unlawful, at least not as [a] price-fixing scheme[], where the agreement on price is necessary to market the product 
at all."" Id. at 23."
734,13," In a threshold inquiry, the Second Circuit considered whether the blanket license should be considered a restraint at all. The 
Second Circuit declined to interpret statements in the Supreme Court's opinion as implying a view on this, holding instead that 
the Court had solely decided that the blanket license was not a per se violation of Section 1 and left for remand ""the question of 
whether the license has any anti-competitive effect at all."" Id. at 935."
734,14," The Second Circuit stated that the Supreme Court's decision in National Collegiate Athletic Ass'n v. Board of Regents, 468 
U.S. 85, 104 S. Ct. 2948, 82 L. Ed. 2d 70 (1984), confirmed that that question was decisive. See Buffalo Broadcasting, 744 F.2d 
at 925. "
738,15," As noted, SESAC contends that the fines are necessary to protect and insure recovery of the large guaranteed payouts it 
made to recruit these key affiliates. "
741,16," In addition, one provision of SESAC's standard affiliate agreement tends to reinforce such an expectation. Section 5(a) states 
that in consideration for the affiliate's grant of rights to SESAC, ""SESAC shall make payments to Writer [the affiliate] in an 
amount equal to the writer's share of the monies allocated by SESAC for distribution to its writer affiliates."" See, e.g. Kohlmann 
Decl. Ex. 106 at ¶ 5(a); id. Ex. 115 at ¶ 5(a). Implicit is that there has been some prior aggregation by SESAC of licensing fees 
due to affiliates. "
744,17," Technically, Jaffe explains, SESAC in 2008 achieved the extra 15% charge by eliminating a previous 15% deduction 
(representing incidental and ambient music) that had been subtracted from the blanket license ""base,"" which in turn is used as a 
multiplier to tabulate the PPL's cost. The ASCAP, BMI, and 2005-2007 SESAC PPLs were priced based on a formula that 
contained that deduction. Id. at 74-75; Hochstadt Decl. Ex. 152. "
745,18," Jaffe's report recounts various communications by stations to SESAC after these changes were imposed to the effect that the 
PPL, as newly priced, was not viable. One station wrote: ""[Y]our 50% attributable multiplier for programming with unknown music 
is illogical and a penalty on us that makes the Per Program unusable."" Id. at 81 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). 
Another wrote that, ""by increasing your multiplier from 5 to 50% --a ten times increase [--] you rendered the per program option 
as worthless."" Id. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). "
746,19," One station wrote that ""the per program license would cost us more than the blanket license, so it has no value to us."" Jaffe 
Rep. 81 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Another wrote that ""[w]e would prefer to use a Per Program License 
Agreement, but the terms imposed by SESAC are both onerous and operationally cumbersome for a small market TV station."" 
Id. at 82 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Another wrote that for years it ""has operated under a per program 
arrangement with ASCAP, BMI, and SESAC. Unfortunately,  [**98] the new terms and conditions offered by SESAC are so 
complex that they render this option all but useless."" Id. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). A fourth wrote: ""SESAC 
imposed much of this unreasonable fee increase by eliminating what had been a reasonably viable per program license option, 
and replacing it with a sham per program scheme, under which it is virtually impossible to achieve any benefit."" Id. (internal 
quotation marks and citation omitted)."
746,20," Elizabeth Haley of Allbritton Communications Company, which owns and operates several broadcast stations, for example, 
testified that ""[a]t the end of th[e] negotiations both Albritton [sic] and SESAC agreed Albritton [sic] stations could not save 
money under the per program license."" Hochstadt Decl. Ex. 9 (Deposition of Elizabeth Haley) at 172-73. "

Steven R. Donziger & Associates, PLLC, is liable to the same extent as Donziger because Donziger was its agent and acted 
within the scope of his employment by it. See In re Klenk, 204 A.D.2d 640, 612 N.Y.S. 2d 220, 220 (App. Div. 1994) (""The

that it wanted an assurance from Bonifaz that it would not be sued if it did so. According to Bonifaz, ""the Procurador [Attorney 
General]. . . said that he will be happy to do whatever we wanted with respect to the case. Then, following that conversation, 
whatever it was, I talked to a woman at his office . . . in which she said 'Well, the Procurador wants this document signed by you 
guys that you're not going to sue Ecuador,' because Judge Rakoff raised the issue in court that 'If you guys do that, you're going 
to get sued.' So they freaked out, and so then they wanted this document signed."" Bonifaz Mar. 1, 2011 Dep. Tr. at 16:8-21. 
(Defendants' objection to this testimony is overruled. The evidence is relevant to the development of the relationship among the 
ROE and the defendants, which goes among other things to the likelihood that influence improperly was brought to bear on the 
Lago Agrio court. The statements attributed to the ROE officials are not hearsay because they are not received for the truth of 
the statements but to explain why the Aguinda plaintiffs, most of whom are LAPs,  [**22] waived claims against the ROE and 
PetroEcuador.)"

788,57," As will appear, these statements made on  [**29] camera were recorded by a documentary film maker whom Donziger 
recruited to make a film about the Lago Agrio case and for which he procured millions in financing from a friend. The film was 
released with the title Crude. In these film clips, Donziger frequently sought to justify improper or questionable actions with respect to the Ecuadorian litigation 
by contending that such behavior was necessary in under the circumstances. But there is no credible evidence to support 
Donziger's claims of necessity or justification, which often hinged on unsubstantiated suppositions of misconduct by Chevron. 
The Court finds that Donziger's attempts of self justification best are understood as attempts to make himself look good 
notwithstanding his conduct. Those attempts are not credible given the entire record of this case and the Court's assessment of 
Donziger."

expressed by others as he thought appropriate."
793,102," Although Mr. Kohn provided the money through 2009, Donziger largely controlled how and when it was spent. Many of the 
payments Kohn made to the plaintiffs' team in Ecuador, scientists, consultants, PR strategists, and experts first flowed through 
Donziger and were subject to his approval. Indeed, Donziger sometimes paid the Ecuadorian legal team from his personal 
account, for which he later was reimbursed by Kohn. See, e.g., Donziger July 19, 2011 Dep. Tr. at 4925:5-14, 4927:2-4928:2. 
And while Kohn ultimately bore the cost of the salaries and bonuses of Ecuadorian lawyers and agents during his time on the 
 [**44] case, Donziger was involved in setting the amount of each. E.g., id. at 4912:18-22 (Q: Who set Mr. Yanza's salary? A: I 
think it was set by mutual consent between Mr. Kohn and myself on the one hand and Mr. Yanza on the other, while Mr. Kohn

A. I believe he did, yes. Q. Did Kohn agree to those bonuses? A. He paid them, so yeah, he agreed to them.""). Donziger testified 
also that he even purchased a home for Yanza. Id. at 4917:3-10. While Donziger paid for the home from his personal checking 
account, he was reimbursed for the payment by Kohn. Id. at 4918:12-18; see also PX 968 (Feb. 8, 2008 Email from S. Donziger

office in June 2007 is not significant. They knew that he was to act in an official capacity before any of the payments were made. 
The money was intended to influence his official actions once he was sworn in. In those circumstances, the payments were 
wrongful. See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. § 201 (the prohibition against bribing a public official extends to a ""person who has been selected 
to be a public official,"" defined as ""any person who has been nominated or appointed to be a public official, or has been officially

836,482," There is another sidelight to the tale of the Cabrera Report. In the course of preparing the Cabrera Report and ensuing 
documents, Stratus, Donziger, and the LAP team dealt not only with new material prepared by Stratus, but with material that the 
LAPs already had in hand from other experts they had employed. They divided some of the available material among the 
Cabrera Report itself, the response that Stratus prepared for Cabrera to make  [**181] to the comments on the Cabrera Report 
submitted on behalf of the LAPs, and perhaps other documents. With so many cooks in the kitchen, there was bound to be 
confusion, and at least one now obvious mistake was made. Donziger and Stratus hired Richard Clapp to prepare two reports. 
PX 1080 (Nov. 6, 2008 Email from D. Beltman to S. Donziger re: ""Clapp"") (""[Clapp] has done two reports that I know of. A long 
while back, he wrote up a summary of the toxic effects of the chemicals in crude oil and drilling fluids, and it was incorporated 
into the expert report as an annex pretty much as is.""). One of Clapp's reports was submitted ""pretty much as is"" as an annex to 
the Cabrera Report, although it was attributed to someone else. Id. Beltman explained to Donziger that Clapp had written also 
another piece, which Stratus had sent to the LAP team in Ecuador, ""but it did not appear in the [LAPs'] comments on the 
Cabrera report, which means it will probably appear in the expert's response to the comments."" Id. Beltman and Donziger were 
adamant, however, that Clapp's authorship of both reports remain secret. Id. (""I don't think we should hand out either one as 
Clapp's thereby distributing proof."").  [**182] Clapp informed Beltman and Donziger at one point that he was planning to use his 
initial report in a piece Donziger asked him to write. PX 1082 (Nov. 18, 2008 Email from R. Clapp to D. Beltman re: ""Ecuador trip 
report and health summary""). Beltman immediately wrote to Donziger: ""We have to talk to Clapp about that [report] and how we 
have to limit its distribution. It CANNOT go into the Congressional Record as being authored by him. You want to talk to him, or 
me?"" Id. The fact that Clapp had written the annex was not revealed until years later, in discovery actions filed in the United 
States."
836,483," PX 2478A (June 13, 2007 Crude Clip). "
837,484," The Court does not credit this claim of confusion. Donziger was the architect of all that occurred with respect to the Cabrera 
Report and is intimately familiar with all the details."

Beltman described a much broader  [**220] role where Stratus was preparing materials in conjunction with local Ecuadorian 
counsel to be used and/or adopted by Cabrera in his report."" The memo went on to state that Shinder had ""made these 
conclusions without being aware of various court orders in Ecuador asking for the parties to turn over materials to Cabrera to 
assist him in the preparation of his report, or being aware generally that the parties in the Ecuador litigation . . . generally work 
very closely with the parties."" Id. It claimed also that Donziger was ""unclear whether the facts a[s] described by Beltman would 
be considered acceptable or improper by an Ecuadorian court. . . . [and] whether the role of Stratus was consistent with 
Ecuadorian rules and procedures, per representations by local counsel."" Id. In fact, however, there were no such uncertainties in 
Donziger's mind. He had chosen Cabrera for the global expert position because Cabrera would cooperate with the LAPs. He 
and Fajardo procured his appointment by coercing Judge Yánez. They had caused Stratus to write all or most of his report and 
then falsely passed that report off — both to the court and to the world press — as the independent work of a neutral,

848,567," Fajardo understood that the collusion between the LAP team and Stratus on the one hand and Cabrera on the other, not to 
mention the manner in which Cabrera was appointed and paid, was improper. As we have seen, he implored Bonfiglio and 
Berlinger to remove the images of Beristain and Maldonado from Crude precisely because the presence of those images could 
lead to discovery of what really had happened. And he was under no illusion that there was any benign explanation for that. He 
told Bonfiglio that if the images of Beristain and Maldonado were left in the film, ""the entire case will simply fall apart on us . . . . 
Those two guys [Beristain and Adolfo Maldonado, another supposed neutral]  [**223] must not appear in the documentary at all!""

by Ecuadorian law. Tr. (Zambrano) 1719:24-1720:16. Even assuming that reading every page would have been required as a 
formal matter of Ecuadorian law, the Court does not find it credible that Zambrano, or many other judges, would have read 
portions of the record that were not relevant to the decision of the case in the course of preparing a decision. It implies no 
criticism of any such omission, which is a different matter from Zambrano's apparent lack of candor in claiming that he actually 
had done that. Accordingly, the Court finds Chevron's argument that Zambrano could not even have read every page of the 
record during the total time over which he was assigned to the case (see PX 4200 (Rayner Direct) passim), though quite 
probably correct, immaterial on the authorship issue."
873,789," One of Donziger's former associates wrote to Sáenz that the Lago Agrio record in January 2010 — more than a year before 
the case was decided — contained ""more than 200,000 pages of trial evidence, 62,000 scientific analyses produced by 
independent laboratories contracted by both parties, testimony from dozens of  [**298] witnesses, and 101 judicial field 
inspections . . . ."" PX 1211 (Jan. 7, 2010 Email From L. Garr to J. Sáenz). "
874,790," Zambrano's contention that he was aided by notes and materials he had collected during his first tenure on the case, i.e., in 
the roughly four month period starting in September 2009, is undermined by the fact he claimed to have destroyed those notes 
and materials. While that was understandable in light of Zambrano's removal from the bench, as he could not have any further 
use for them, there remains a lack of anything to corroborate that part of his story."

created by Guerra before Zambrano issued its counterpart. Chevron's forensic expert testified that the metadata of the order — 
which is 72 pages long — reflects that the order was edited for a total of only two minutes before it was last saved. Because it is 
impossible to draft a 72-page document in two minutes, and because the order is nearly identical to the order that was issued by 
Zambrano, it is much more likely, and the Court finds, that the ninth draft order was written by Guerra, issued by Zambrano, and 
for some reason later last-saved on Guerra's computer. Id. The Court notes also that the fact that these draft Chevron orders all had a file system create date of July 23, 2010 does not 
suggest that all were created then or that they were not prepared  [**358] by Guerra when he said he prepared them. Forensic 
analysis of his computer showed that he installed Windows XP on July 23, 2010 and then transferred these draft orders, as part 
of a larger transfer of data on the same date, from an external hard drive. The obvious inference is that Guerra backed up his 
computer to the external hard drive before installing Windows XP and then restored his files from the external hard drive to the

897,983," Donziger argued that Guerra must have lied concerning the alleged fall 2009 meeting at the Honey & Honey restaurant

that Donziger was in Ecuador from October 6 until some time on October 9, 2009. PX 1509 (Donziger Immigration Records). 
Donziger's contention that the alleged meeting must have taken place at a different time rests on assumptions that the Court 
regards as unfounded. Nevertheless, the point is academic in view of the Court's finding on this point, which to reiterate is that 
the LAPs, with Donziger's authorization, paid Guerra during this period to ghostwrite Zambrano's orders on the Chevron case

payment of fees. DI 1104 (LAPs Mem.); DI 1105 (Donziger Mem.). Following the withdrawal, Donziger repeatedly moved to 
adjourn deadlines or stay this case, always claiming that he had ""limited resources"" with which to secure new counsel and 
 [**400] defend himself. DI 1212 (Donziger Aff.) ¶ 14; see also DI 1211 (Mot. to Stay) (""A stay is absolutely necessary if I am to 
have a realistic chance to obtain the funds for, and to retain, substitute counsel""); DI 1214 (May 23, 2013 Tr.), at 3:25-4:4; DI 
1318 (July 18, 2013 Tr), at 11:13-18 (""my prior counsel already spent thousands of hours dealing with their previous motions . . . 
which essentially drove my counsel off of this case . . . because I couldn't afford to pay their fees anymore because they were all 
wasted on these previous motions for summary judgment""); DI 1369 (Mot. for Order to Show Cause); DI 1435 (Mot. for 
Extension of Time); DI 1459 (LAPs Mem.). Although the Court largely granted Donziger's requested relief, it made clear time and again that it would be willing to consider 
further extensions or delays if Donziger provided competent evidence or sworn testimony substantiating his claim that he was 
constrained by a lack of resources. E.g., DI 1214 (May 23, 2013 Tr.), at 13:25-14:6; DI 1185 (Order), at 3 (""The Court . . . is 
willing to consider [Mr. Donziger's] issues in the event a well supported motion is filed.""); DI 1302 (Order Denying Mot. for Stay); "
909,," DI 1407 (Order  [**401] Denying Stay). Donziger never did so. At trial, however, Donziger admitted that, notwithstanding his 
claims of lack of resources, he actually had secured additional funding of $2.5 million in March 2013 — two months before his 
counsel withdrew — from a British investor. See Tr. (Donziger) 2528:9-2529:11. He admitted also that he personally had 
received $600,000 in liquid assets and over one million in real estate over the preceding year and a half from probate actions he 
initiated against family members in Florida. Id. 2537:6-2539:2."

910,1103," While Donziger tried to explain this away, the fact that he did not report the bribe solicitation is undisputed. Moreover, the 
explanation is not persuasive. Donziger claimed that there were ""various reasons"" why no report was made, but the only 
reasons he mentioned were that he claimed that he did not regard Guerra as having had much credibility and that he was ""very 
concerned that doing anything at that point to turn [Guerra] in would give Chevron an excuse to further use it against the court or 
against the process such that the trial could be derailed."" Tr. (Donziger) 2650:17-2651:2. Given the facts that (a) Donziger 
frequently claimed that he was afraid that Chevron would corrupt the process and buy a favorable outcome; (b) Donziger had 
made complaints against other judges, id. 2601:5-17; and (c) the Ecuadorian government, up to and including the president, was 
openly and fully  [**406] supportive of Donziger and the LAPs, those explanations are of limited value. The failure of Donziger 
and the LAPs to report Guerra's bribe solicitation, moreover, certainly was not comparable to Chevron's failures in light of the 
hostility of the Ecuadorian government to Chevron. Supra Facts § IX.A.4, infra Discussion § VII.C.6."

Council personnel action dated Nov. 16, 2010 attaching Zambrano's sworn assets statement dated July 31, 2008), showed that 
he had cash on hand of under $2,500, not even enough to pay his outstanding Diners Club balance. He owed banks nearly 
$8,000. Apart from two used vehicles, one of which was pledged, the only other material asset shown was $27,500 of real estate 
owned by his wife. Zambrano made no effort to explain  [**407] these data, to show that his financial circumstances had 
improved, or to deny any economic motive to participate in the bribe arrangement. Nor is it likely that there was any 
improvement in Zambrano's financial situation between July 2008 and the issuance of the Judgment. "

stick to the claim. He warned that there would be ""HUGE implications for the legal case"" if they disavowed the comparison to 
Exxon Valdez, and told Amazon Watch that it ""could terribly prejudice the people it is trying to help if it makes this change."" PX

913,1118," The emails, even if taken literally, would not utterly defeat the idea that Zambrano had been bribed. Even if the corrupt 
bargain had been struck, Fajardo may have been concerned that Zambrano would double cross the LAPs. Given the LAP 
team's views of Chevron, the risk of being outbid, whether real or the product of fevered speculation, may have been in his mind."
913,1119," That is especially true with respect to Eric Westenberger and Anne Carrasco of Patton Boggs, who were recipients. As 
Donziger, Fajardo, and Yanza must have known, they had no reason to suppose that these lawyers, who were subject to 
compulsory process in the United States, would have allowed themselves to be swept into a conspiracy to bribe a judge. Indeed, 
earlier in 2010, Donziger, Fajardo, and Yanza had seen the LAPs' Denver lawyers withdraw in the Stratus 1782 proceeding as 
soon as they learned the truth about the Cabrera Report."
913,1120," Chevron objected to the emails on, inter alia, hearsay grounds."
913,1121," As the text shows, the critical point for which the emails might be used would be  [**417] to support assertions by Fajardo, 
explicit and implicit, that the outcome of the case was in doubt and that the submissions of which he was urging prompt 
completion could matter. This in turn could imply that the case had not been fixed. But the emails are inadmissible hearsay for 
any such purpose. HN3[
] Fed. R. Evid. 802 renders ""hearsay"" inadmissible. Rule 801(c) defines ""hearsay"" as an out of court ""statement"" offered ""to prove the truth of the matter asserted in the statement."" Rule 801(a) defines ""statement"" as ""a person's oral assertion, written 
assertion, or nonverbal conduct, if the person intended it as an assertion."" Fajardo's statements in these emails, to the extent 
they are offered for the purpose of proving that the outcome of the Lago Agrio case was in doubt and thus that the case had not 
been fixed, were assertions and therefore classic hearsay. Nor would they be admissible under the state of mind exception to 
the extent they contain statements of belief. Fed. R. Evid. 803(3). "

gaffe, no doubt involuntary, does not affect the merits of the judgment being examined, since, regardless, it refers to an alarming 
quantity of benzene in the environment."" Id. The appellate panel addressed also the fact that the Judgment reported certain 
results for PAHs in milligrams rather than micrograms but concluded only that ""the assessment of the quantity of contamination 
based on these samples should be reduced considerably."" Id. And the panel noted that the Judgment omitted the ""less than"" 
symbol in reporting the results for mercury, and ""[f]or this reason, emphasi[z]ed . . .that the reference to the presence of 'high

923,1192," As noted, attempts to enforce the Judgment in the United States always have been part of the plan. Indeed, even when the 
defendants sought to defeat the preliminary injunction in this case by disclaiming any then present intention to seek enforcement 
in New York, they conspicuously did not disclaim any  [**447] such intention elsewhere in the United States. Moreover, the 
reasons for their failure to seek enforcement to date in the United States are fairly obvious. As an initial matter, the defendants' repeated efforts to have this case assigned to a different judge make clear their preference 
for almost any other forum. Any attempt, however, to enforce the Judgment in the United States while this action remains 
pending would carry a substantial risk that the enforcement proceeding would be litigated here for two reasons. First, as long as this action remains pending, any suit in a federal court by any of the LAPs (other than the two LAP 
Representatives who defended this case at trial) to enforce the judgment likely would be a compulsory counterclaim in this case, 
as the defaulting LAPs are defendants here and have not answered the complaint in this case. Fed. R. Civ. P. 13(a)(1). Second, there in any event would be a substantial chance that any enforcement action brought in a federal court other than this 
one would be transferred to this Court under 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a) or 1407, as occurred with Patton Boggs' related lawsuit in the 
District of New Jersey. Patton Boggs LLP v. Chevron Corp., No.  [**448] 12 Civ. 9176 (LAK), DI 42 (filed Dec. 14, 2012). 
Moreover, as the LAPs all are aliens, any enforcement action brought in a state court, other than those of the two states of which 
Chevron is a citizen (California and Delaware), could and quite likely would be removed by Chevron to federal court and then 
likely transferred to this Court."

929,1226," That is true also, albeit  [**465] not to the same extent, of Chevron. Chevron, however, has explained its case extensively 
both in summation and in extensive post-trial submissions."
929,1227," As frequently occurs in bench trials, most of the exhibits on both sides were received subject to subsequent rulings on (1) 
motions to strike, where such motions were made, and (2) objections, which in the case of Chevron's objections are set forth in 
an extensive spreadsheet listing each exhibit, Chevron's objections, and defendants' responses. A similar practice was 
employed with respect to the parties' designations of deposition testimony. Some of these motions and objections were ruled upon during or after the trial. Others are dealt with in this opinion, including in 
Appendix III. Beyond that, little purpose would be served by the making of specific rulings as to the admissibility of hundreds or 
possibly thousands of exhibits and many pages of deposition testimony that do not figure in the outcome. Suffice it to say that 
the Court has received in evidence any exhibit or testimony upon which it relies in this opinion."
929,1228," There is a basis of subject matter jurisdiction over these and other non-federal claims completely independent of the RICO 
claims, namely 28 U.S.C. § 1332. See generally DI 283 (Am. Compl.), ¶¶ 8-17, 20, 23. At the outset of the action, there was one uncertainty as to the existence of complete diversity, viz. the allegation that defendant 
Selva Viva Selviva CIA, LTDA (actually Selva Viva CIA, LTDA, subsequently referred to as ""Selva Viva"") is an Ecuadorian 
limited liability company. Id. ¶ 14. Had that been true, it would have been a citizen of every state or nation of which any of its 
members was a citizen. E.g., Handlesman v. Bedford Vill. Green Assocs. L.P., 213 F.3d 48, 52 (2d Cir. 2000). There is no 
allegation as to the identity or citizenship of its members. Accordingly, if paragraph 13 of the complaint (paragraph 14 of the 
amended complaint) had been accurate, plaintiff's failure to have alleged that none of Selva Viva's members was a citizen 
 [**467] of Delaware or California, the states in which Chevron is organized and in which it has its principal place of business, 
respectively, would have been fatal to diversity or alienage jurisdiction. But that pleading flaw has been rendered immaterial by 
the proof at trial. The Court finds that Selva Viva is, and from its inception always has been, an Ecuadorian corporation with its principal place of 
business in Ecuador. Tr. (Donziger) 2635:4-6 (Selva Viva is an entity created under corporate law of Ecuador); Donziger June "
930,24," , 2013 Dep. Tr. at 103:6-16 (acknowledging incorporation of Selva Viva and Donziger's designation as president); Tr. (H. 
Piaguaje) 2677:12-2678:3 (stating that witness is a 40 percent shareholder of Selva Viva); PX 6906 (record of incorporation of 
Selva Viva, its entry into the Register of Companies, and the designation of Donziger as president); PX 426 (Ecuadorian court 
record reflecting Fajardo's description of Selva Viva as a corporation); Tr. (Kohn) 1420:11-20 (Selva Viva headquartered in 
Quito, Ecuador); Tr. (Donziger) 10:6-17 (Selva Viva's office is in office of LAPs' Ecuadorian counsel); Donziger June 26, 2013 
Dep. Tr. at 737:7-14 (Selva Viva office is in Ecuador);  [**468] DX 226T-227T (same). It therefore is a citizen of Ecuador. Thus, 
plaintiff Chevron is a citizen of California and Delaware, and defendants all are citizens of Ecuador or of states other than 
California and Delaware. The matter in controversy, exclusive of interest and costs, obviously exceeds the sum of $75,000. 
Subject matter jurisdiction exists under 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a) and (c). For the sake of good order, the complaint and the amended 
complaint are deemed amended to conform to the proof that Selva Viva is an Ecuadorian corporation with its principal place of 
business in Ecuador. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(b)(2); 28 U.S.C. § 1653. Accordingly, even a pretrial dismissal of the RICO claims 
would not have permitted dismissal of the non-RICO claims for want of subject matter jurisdiction."

""speculation about the unfettered choices made by independent actors not before the court,"" 133 S.Ct. 1150 n.5 (quotation 
marks and citation omitted), is misplaced. Clapper acknowledged that the ""substantial risk"" and ""clearly impending"" standards 
may be coextensive and, even if they are not, did not abandon the former. See id. There is no proper comparison to be made 
between the chain of speculation that the Clapper Court condemned as too attenuated  [**486] and the far more direct 
relationship between defendants' fraud in this case and any foreign judgment enforcing the Ecuadorian Judgment. Even more basic, Clapper must be read in the context in which it was written — an attempt to use the courts to cabin the actions 
of the executive branch. The Court made clear that its ""standing inquiry has been especially rigorous when reaching the merits 
of the dispute would force us to decide whether an action taken by one of the other two branches of the Federal Government 
was unconstitutional."" Id. at 1146-47 (quoting Raines v. Byrd, 521 U.S. 811, 819-20, 117 S. Ct. 2312, 138 L. Ed. 2d 849 (1997)) 
(internal quotation marks omitted). This purely private dispute implicates none of the separation of powers concerns that inform the standing doctrine, particularly in 
cases like Clapper. It therefore would be entirely wrong to apply literally some of the language used in Clapper, assuming that 
the language was meant to impose standards higher than usual in the first place, to purely private litigation. Such application 
could alter dramatically, to cite but one example, the law governing preliminary injunctions in trade secret cases by transforming 
the requirement of impending dissemination  [**487] into a jurisdictional question, rather than a question on the merits. See

938,1271," Fraud in the context of independent actions or other applications for relief from a judgment generally falls into two or three 
categories. ""Relief is always possible for 'extrinsic' fraud"" and for ""fraud on the court,"" which often is confused with or treated as 
a subset of extrinsic fraud. 12 Moore's Federal Practice § 60.81[1][b]. Relief for so-called ""intrinsic fraud"" often has been 
available less frequently. Id. § 60.81[1][b][ii]. There is more recent discussion as to whether the supposed distinction between 
extrinsic and intrinsic fraud is or should be meaningful. Id. § 60.81[1][b][iv]; see Gleason v. Jandrucko, 860 F.2d 556, 560 (2d

defendant in the Lago Agrio case — because Chevron did not succeed to Texaco liabilities by virtue of its indirect acquisition of 
its shares years after the events in question. Much of the portion of the Judgment rejecting Chevron's position was copied

and U.S. lawyers for the LAPs, and Stratus and the other LAP experts, consultants, and advisers. Under New York law, a 
principal is liable for the acts of its agents, committed within the scope of their employment or actual or apparent authority. E.g., 
American Soc'y of Mech. Eng'rs, Inc. v. Hydrolevel Corp., 456 U.S. 556, 566, 102 S. Ct. 1935, 72 L. Ed. 2d 330 (1982); Standard

awareness of Chevron's complaint and other claims of misconduct was insufficient to constitute ratification. DI 1858 (LAP Reps.' 
Post-trial Mem. of Law), at 15-17. There are two fundamental problems with the argument. First, a principal is liable for the torts of an agent under New York law as long as the agent acted within  [**524] the scope of the 
agent's actual or apparent authority. Ratification is immaterial except in the absence of actual or apparent authority. E.g., Dover, 
Ltd. v. A.B. Watley, Inc., 423 F. Supp. 2d 303, 318-19 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) (mag. op.); Restatement (Third) of Agency §§ 7.03(1)(a), 
7.04 (principal liable for torts of agent committed with actual authority or ratified by principal), 7.03(2)(b), 7.08 (principal liable for 
torts of agent committed with apparent authority). Moreover, an Ecuadorian law expert for Chevron explained, and this Court 
holds, that the law in Ecuador is the same. DI 1413-11 (Apr. 5, 2013 Velazquez Decl.), Ex. 92, Ann. B. (""According to rules of 
contractual and tort liability, the client is held liable for the actions of his agent, even when the client does not become aware of "
946,," the agent's conduct until after it has occurred, if he takes no action to reject it or, failing that, to withdraw the agency 
authorization and, even more so, if he benefits from such conduct.""). Second, the Court finds that these defendants knowingly ratified the misconduct, substantially for the reasons set forth by 
Chevron. DI 1847 (Chevron Corp. Post-trial Mem. of Law), at 254-56."

950,1337," Norex Petroleum Ltd. v. Access Indus., Inc., 631 F.3d 29, 32-33 (2d Cir. 2010). Although the Court adheres to Norex, it respectfully questions whether RICO's ""silence"" as to extraterritorial application, 
 [**538] the basis for the Norex holding, correctly resolves the question whether Congress intended that RICO apply outside the 
territorial limits of the United States. As the Supreme Court observed in Morrison, its reliance on the presumption against 
extraterritorial application was not intended to impose a ""clear statement"" requirement, ""if by that is meant a requirement that a 
statute say 'this law applies abroad,'"" before it could be so applied. See 130 S. Ct. at 2883. ""Assuredly, context can be consulted 
as well"" in pursuit of statutory meaning and Congressional intent. Id. Given RICO's heritage as a weapon of choice in prosecuting the Sicilian Mafia, see, e.g., United States v. Casamento, 887 F.2d 
1141 (2d Cir. 1989), and the more recent application of racketeering statutes to transnational drug and terrorism networks, e.g.,

that the character of the enterprise here at issue was predominantly domestic by any reasonable standard. The enterprise, as 
will appear, was essentially the LAP team, including Donziger and the LAPs' other lawyers (both U.S. and Ecuadorian), and its 
host of consultants, PR people, financiers, and advisors including Stratus, Beltman, Maest, Hinton, Lehane, Russell, 
Calmbacher, H5, and many others. With the exception of the handful of Ecuadorian lawyers, Yanza, and the two entities that he 
and Donziger controlled, virtually every member of the enterprise — and there were a great many — were American. The nerve 
center of the entire operation, see Chao Fan Xu, 706 F.3d at 976-77, was in New York City, where Donziger was based and, 
despite roughly monthly visits to Ecuador, spent most of his time. In any case, it was in the United States. This is where almost 
all of the important decisions were made, the location from which the Ecuadorian lawyers were supervised (except when 
Donziger actually was in Ecuador), and the place from which the pressure campaign with all of its many different 
 [**542] aspects was organized, supervised, and run."

university professor, as a father and grandfather in my family, I cannot  [**653] hold back from analyzing and criticizing President 
Correa's actions, which constitute violations of the rule of law that lead to a lack of independence in the branches or powers of

inconsistent with any merger of Texaco and Chevron — merged companies do not become parent and subsidiary. The second 
part of the sentence seeks to imply that a parent company and a wholly owned subsidiary are a ""combined company"" and that 
the parent is liable for the debts and obligations of the subsidiary. That of course is not so unless the corporate veil is pierced or 
the separate corporate existence of the subsidiary is disregarded on another basis. Moreover, there is no evidence that any

assuming that they were Chevron employees at the time of the Aguinda appeal, they acted as attorneys for Texaco and their 
statements as Texaco's attorneys did not bind Chevron. Id. In any case, the evidence at this trial showed, and the Court finds,

of United States v. Pelullo, 964 F.2d 193, 201 (3d Cir. 1992) (""[T]he testimony of the custodian or other qualified witness is not a 
sine qua non of admissibility in the occasional case where the requirements for qualification as a business record can be met by 
documentary evidence, affidavits, or admissions of the parties, i.e., by circumstantial evidence, or by a combination of direct and 
circumstantial evidence."" (citation and quotations omitted)). Guerra's bank statements are circumstantial  [**827] evidence of the 
deposit slips' reliability as to those points, and that is as true of the two bearing the purported signature of Centeno as it is of the 
others. The statements corroborate the dates, amounts, and account numbers listed on the deposit slips. In addition, Guerra 
testified that he retrieved the entire group of deposit slips (PX 1713) directly from Banco Pichincha. Tr. (Guerra) 934:2-7. The 
Chevron investigator independently obtained directly from the bank copies of the two deposit slips purportedly signed by 
Cenento and that bore her cedula number, PX 1718 and PX 1719. The testimony of Guerra and the investigator, in addition to 
establishing authenticity through the chains of custody, support an inference that the bank maintained those records in the 
normal course of its business and that it was its regular course of business to do so."
1064,123," There  [**828] is an additional basis for admitting the two deposit slips that purport to contain Centeno's signature, assuming 
that those slips in fact do bear her signature. By signing, Centeno verified the accuracy of the date, time, amount, account, and 
recipient contained on the deposit slip. Her signature thus was an adoptive admission of all of the other statements contained on

1066,132," United States v. Gigante, 166 F.3d 75, 82 (2d Cir. 1999). Although not expressly required, there is  [**834] abundant independent evidence of the existence of the conspiracy."
1066,133, Fed. R. Evid. 1101(b).
1066,134," United States v. Stanchich, 550 F.2d 1294, 1299 n.4 (2d Cir. 1977). The Court notes that there can be no conspiracy to bribe because the crime of bribery is one which necessarily requires the 
concerted action of the briber and the bribee. United States v. Sager, 49 F.2d 725, 727-28 (2d Cir. 1931) (""[w]here concert is 
necessary to an offense, conspiracy does not lie""). Defendants therefore conceivably might have argued that Donziger and 
Fajardo could not have been co-conspirators, and the statements in conversations (a) and (b) therefore are inadmissible 
hearsay, because Donziger and Fajardo could not have been convicted of conspiring with Zambrano to commit bribery. But that 
argument would be of no avail for three reasons. First, defendants did not make the argument. It therefore was waived. Even if they had made the argument, however, it would 
have failed for each of two independent reasons. Second, admission of a statement under Rule 801(d)(2)(E) does not require that the technical elements necessary to obtain a 
conspiracy conviction all have been satisfied — only that the statements were made  [**835] ""in furtherance of some joint 
purpose."" United States v. Trowery, 542 F.2d 623, 626 (3d Cir. 1976) (""The absence of a conspiracy count . . . is without legal 
significance in determining whether [one's] statements were admissible against [another]. The Government need only prove a 
conspiracy in fact between [the two] to make the words of one, spoken in furtherance of some joint purpose, the words of the 
other as well.""); United States v. El-Mezain, 664 F.3d 467, 502 (5th Cir. 2011). Rule 801(d)(2)(E), if otherwise satisfied, therefore "
1067,," would have warranted receipt of the statements even if the participants in the two conversations could not have been convicted 
of conspiracy to commit bribery in addition to bribery. Third, all of the participants in the conversations would have been subject to conviction for conspiracy notwithstanding the rule 
noted in the Sager case. The Court of Appeals has limited the rule set forth in Sager — that there can be no criminal conviction 
of the payer and taker of a bribe for the crime of conspiracy to bribe — to apply only to situations in which the conspiracy 
""involved [no] more participants than were necessary for the commission of the"" crime of bribery.  [**836] United States v. 
Benter, 457 F.2d 1174, 1178 (2d Cir. 1972). A conspiracy may be charged where the bribe payer and bribe recipient use a ""go 
between"" — a person whose participation is not necessary to the offense of bribery, which requires only offer and acceptance in 
exchange for (usually) official conduct — to facilitate the bribe. See id. That is exactly the situation here. The bribe givers 
(Fajardo, Donziger, and perhaps Yanza) and the bribe taker (Zambrano) used Guerra as their go between. Although he 
facilitated the bribe, Guerra's participation was not essential to the crime of bribery, which required Fajardo and/or Donziger on 
one side and Zambrano on the other. All of the participants in the bribe scheme therefore could have been convicted of 
conspiracy. Cf. United States v. Wong, No. 99 CR. 842 (RPP), 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3545, 2000 WL 297163, at *3 (S.D.N.Y.

1134,*, This amended order and opinion corrects the docket numbers associated with the parties' motions. 
1141,1," Record citations to the American  [**2] Airlines main bankruptcy case (Case No. 11-15463) are identified as ""Main ECF No."" 
while citations to the Adversary Proceeding record (Case No. 13-01392) are reflected as ""ECF No."" "
1142,2," This Court subsequently found that filing the California action violated the automatic stay and was void ab initio: [T]he action filed by the Clayton Act plaintiffs in California . . . was filed in violation of the automatic stay imposed by this 
case, and the Clayton Act plaintiffs did not file a motion in advance seeking to lift the stay so as to permit that filing. As a 
result, that action is void ab initio as to the debtors. The Court rejects the notion that the filing of the California action was 
somehow inadvertent,  [**6] as these same lawyers have engaged in similar conduct in the past as discussed by Judge 
Gerber in his decision in Adelphia Comm'ns. Corp. (345 B.R. 69 at 73, Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 2006). See Sept. 12, 2013 Hr'g. Tr. at 42:12-19, 43:1-6 (ECF No. 43). "
1145,3," The facts in Kahn illustrate the kind of unusual circumstances where waiver under Rule 39 is found: The record shows that Kahn knew exactly what he was doing . . . Kahn's letters to Judge Leval, and the statements in 
deposition and during the pretrial conference permit no ""reasonable presumption against waiver."" Kahn clearly sought to 
waive his jury demand by requesting a bench trial before Judge Leval, GM agreed to the waiver, and the record contains 
ample evidence of the waiver. These facts, in my view, satisfy the requirement of Rule 39(a) that jury  [**18] demand 
waivers be made by written or oral stipulation entered in the record. Kahn waived his jury demand both in writing and orally. Kahn at 213. "
1146,4," Defendants' reliance on the original complaint's passing reference to increased prices is unavailing. It is best understood as 
background to the original complaint's contention that the merger should be enjoined because of the threat of injury. See Feb. 
13, Hr'g. Tr. at 76:10-15 (Plaintiffs' counsel stating that ""[Defendant's counsel] mentioned that there were acts that took place 
prior to the merger, in which damages could have been claimed . . . The announcement that these companies acted in lock step 
is evidence that this is  [**23] what can be anticipated in a completed merger, subsequently . . . It is not a claim in and of itself."") "
1147,5," The other cases cited by Defendants similarly do not squarely address whether a plaintiff is foreclosed from bringing  [**24] a 
Section 4 damages claim prior to the consummation of a merger or any other allegedly illegal anti-competitive transaction. See 
generally Nelson v. Pacific Southwest Airlines, 399 F. Supp. 1025, 1027-29 (S.D. Cal. 1975); McTamney v. Stolt Tankers & 
Terminals (Holdings), S.A. 678 F. Supp. 118, 119-21 (E.D. Pa. 1987); Mr. Frank, Inc. v. Waste Management, Inc., 591 F. Supp. 
859, 865, 867 (N.D. Ill. 1984)."
1147,6," The prayer for relief states: A. Declaring, finding, adjudging, and decreeing that the agreement of the defendants and American to merge violates 
Section 7 of  [**25] the Clayton Antitrust Act. 15 U.S.C. § 18. B. Preliminarily enjoining the defendants from consummating their merger during the pendency of this action C. Permanently enjoining the defendants from consummating their merger or requiring divestiture. D. Awarding to plaintiffs their cost of suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee, as provided by Section 16 of the Clayton 
Antitrust Act. 15 U.S.C. § 26 E. Granting to plaintiffs such other and further relief to which they may be entitled and which the Court finds to be just and 
appropriate. See, Orig. Compl. at 25-26."
1147,7," While Defendants do not cite to Rule 39 itself, the cases they cite regarding the purported oral waiver are all cases applying 
Rule 39(a)."
1147,8," See, e.g., Sept. 12 Hr'g. Tr. at 88:25, 89:1-3 "
1148,," THE COURT: ""[T]he case will be here for all purposes, and so you consent to this court resolving the matter on the merits for 
purposes of any objections you could have as to that? MR. ALIOTO: ""Yes, Your Honor."" MR. ALIOTO: ""It is, in fact, your Honor, a bench trial."" Id. at 105:9-10. "
1149,9," The Defendants raise the bad faith and prejudice arguments specifically with respect to the Plaintiffs' jury demand amendment. 
Nonetheless, the Court will consider these arguments with regard to the addition of the damages claim because the jury demand 
only  [**32] arises if the proposed treble damages amendment is permitted."
1149,10," As Defendants' counsel stated: ""What Mr. Alioto is really saying implicitly is that he doesn't accept that there is any remedy 
unless you can close a merger. And as we've discussed in our brief, Your Honor, we just fundamentally disagree with that. 
There's lots of other remedial powers that Courts have. Post-closing relief happens all the time...."" Nov. 25 Hr'g. Tr. at 69:6-11."
1149,11," The Court in McGee denied the plaintiff's motion to amend the complaint based not only on the three-year delay, but also the 
plaintiff's failure to file the proposed amended complaint with his motion. See 940 F. Supp. 2d at 109-10. "
1150,12," HN19[
] A party may suffer antitrust injury but still lack antitrust standing. See Cargill, 479 U.S. at 110 n.5. Antitrust standing is distinct from the constitutional standing requirement. Assoc. Gen. Contractors v. Cal. State Council of Carpenters, 459 U.S. 
519, 535 n.31, 103 S. Ct. 897, 74 L. Ed. 2d 723. While harm to the antitrust plaintiff is sufficient to satisfy constitutional standing, 
a court must make a further determination whether the plaintiff is a proper party to bring a private antitrust  [**38] action. Id. In 
considering whether a plaintiff is such a proper party, courts consider the directness of the injury, whether damages are 
speculative, and whether there is potential for duplicative recovery. See Cargill, 479 U.S. at 110 n.5; AMA v. United Healthcare 
Corp., 588 F.Supp. 2d 432, 448 (S.D.N.Y. 2008). Because Plaintiffs have failed to show even antitrust injury, the Court need not 
address the issue of antitrust standing at this time. "
1151,13," While not germane to the Court's ruling today on the Motion, the Court notes that the Plaintiffs have failed to amend the 
complaint to address other issues identified in the TRO Opinion. See TRO Opinion at 18-21 (noting, among other things, 
difficulties with Plaintiffs' discussion of market share, the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, failure to address the merger in light of the 
DOJ Settlement, and neglecting to address specific city-pairs consistent with generally accepted airline antitrust analysis). "
1152,14," Of course, the Court previously issued a detailed decision denying Plaintiff's motion for a temporary restraining order that 
sought to enjoin the consummation of the Merger. See Fjord v. AMR Corp., 502 B.R. 23. The relief sought by the TRO Motion 
appears to be essentially the same as the relief sought by the ""hold separate"" injunction contained in the PAC. See Feb. 13 Hr'g. 
Tr. at 34:14-25, 35:1-2, 36:1-15. "
1153,**," The Honorable Marvin J. Garbis, Senior United States District Judge for the District of Maryland, sitting by designation."
1153,*, This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Cir. R. 36-3. 
1156,1," The Defendants also jointly filed a section 2-615 motion arguing that the Amended Complaint failed to allege specific facts as to 
whether the State reasonably exercised diligence to investigate potential claims as required to invoke the discovery rule. The 
Court denied this motion. "
1159,2, Philips NV has also offered to make its representative deponent available by remote electronic means pursuant to Rule 206(h).
1159,3," The State insists that it is not asking the Court to compel Philips NV to fly one of its agents to Chicago from the Netherlands 
because Philips could name someone from one of its U.S. subsidiaries, or even an actor. According to the State, if Philips NV 
chooses to name a person outside of Cook County, it should bear the additional burdens and costs that choice creates. The 
State presents no authority for its position, and the Court does not accept it."
1159,4," The procedure for a Rule 206(a)(1) deposition is substantially similar to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (FRCP) 30(b)(6). See 
III. Sup. Ct. R. 206, Committee Comment to 2011 Amendment. Unlike Rule 203, which governs the locations of depositions, the 
Federal Rules do not specify the location for a Rule 30(b)(6) deposition. In lieu of such a rule, the Federal Courts have filled this 
gap. In re Outsidewall Tire Litig, 267 F.R.D. 466, 470-71 (E.D.Va. 2010). "
1166,1," Defendants concede this point in the Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law. (Doc. 88, p. 68)."
1166,2," Some courts outside the Sixth Circuit, however, have used the ""only viable economic option"" standard. More specifically, those 
courts have found [*17]  tying arrangements where the buyer's ""only viable economic option"" is to purchase both the tying and 
the tied product. See Data Gen. Corp. v. Grumman Sys. Support Corp., 36 F.3d 1147, 1180 (1st Cir. 1994), abrogated on other 
grounds by, Reed Elsevier, Inc. v. Muchnick, 559 U.S. 154, 130 S. Ct. 1237, 176 L. Ed. 2d 18 (2010); Amerinet, Inc. v. Xerox 
Corp., 972 F.2d 1483, 1500 (8th Cir. 1992). In one Eastern District of Michigan case, the district court accepted a ""synthesized"" 
standard of the Sixth Circuit's standard and the ""only viable economic option"" standard, requiring that the plaintiff show there 
was ""no economically practical option"" other than to buy the tied product. Valassis Communs., Inc. v. News Am. Inc., No. 2:06-
cv-10240, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 66672, at *17 (E.D. Mich. Jan. 24, 2011), adopted by, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 62495 (E.D. Mich. 
June 15, 2011). "
1170,3," The last purchase [*31]  of a Versamark printer occurred in 2009, long before the introduction of the May 2012 Policy or July 
2013 Policy. "
1172,4," While [*38]  it seems paradoxical to permit a legitimate business justification to a per se tying claim given that a per se claim of 
illegality generally does not permit such justifications or defenses, courts nonetheless have considered such defenses in the per 
se context. One court has offered the following explanation: It may seem somewhat anomalous to permit justifications for arrangements that are apparently subject to per 
condemnation. However, per se rules are simply examples of presumptions that exist throughout antitrust law, and ""easy 
labels do not always supply ready answers."" Broadcast Music, Inc. v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 441 U.S. 1, 8, 
60 L. Ed. 2d 1, 99 S. Ct. 1551 (1979). Before applying the per se label we must determine whether the challenged practice 
is one of those types that ""is 'plainly anticompetitive' and very likely without 'redeeming virtue.'"" Id. at 9. Allowing the 
defendant to assert a business justification defense is one way of inquiring into whether the reasons for the relatively 
categorical historical condemnation of tie-ins apply to the challenged arrangements. The Mozart Co. v. Mercedes-Benz of North America, Inc., 833 F.2d 1342, 1349 n. 5 (9th Cir. 1987)."
1172,5," Where courts have accepted free-riding as a justification, it has been in the context of intrabrand free-riding occurring between 
different retailers of the same brand of a product. See Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Serv. Corp., 465 U.S. 752, 104 S. Ct. 1464, 
79 L. Ed. 2d 775 (1984) (sale of manufacturer's herbicide at issue); Continental T.V. v. GTE Sylvania, 433 U.S. 36, 53 L. Ed. 2d 
568, 97 S. Ct. 2549 (1977) (sale of one brand of televisions at issue). That is not the situation here. "
1174,6," That evidence also is relied upon to support Kodak's legitimate business justification under the Sherman Act. There, the Court 
finds the evidence, even if viewed in favor of Kodak, is weak, such that it is insufficient to preclude a likelihood of success on the 
Sherman Act claim. Here, however, the focus of the Lanham Act and the ODPTA claim is the falsity of the statement. The 
conflicting evidence precludes a finding of likelihood of success on the [*49]  merits at this stage. "
1179,1," The other five cases are Pac. Mar. Ass'n v. Int'l Longshore & Warehouse Union Local 8, Case No. 3:12-cv-01100-SI (D. Or.); 
Int'l Longshore & Warehouse Union v. Port of Portland, Case No. 3:12-cv-01494-SI (D. Or.); Hooks v. Int'l Longshore & 
Warehouse Union, Case No. 3:12-cv-1088-SI (D. Or.); Hooks v. Int'l Longshore &Warehouse Union, Case No. 3:12-cv-01691-SI 
(D. Or.); and Pac. Mar. Ass'n v. N.L.R.B., Case No. 3:12-cv-02179-MO (D. Or.). "
1180,2," This decision was subsequently vacated. See Pac. Mar. Ass'n v. N.L.R.B., Case No. 3:12-cv-02179-MO, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
86279, Judgment, Docket 54 (D. Or. June 17, 2013). "
1181,3, PMA ultimately prevailed in that lawsuit and the NLRB award was vacated. Supra n.2.
1181,4," After the briefing and oral argument on the pending motions, the NLRB issued a decision concluding that ILWU had engaged in 
unfair labor practices. Int'l Longshore & Warehouse Union, AFL-CIO, 2013 NLRB LEXIS 573, 2013 WL 4587186 (NLRB Aug. 28, 
2013). "
1184,5," The cases considered whether: (1) the labor market, as opposed to the ""business"" or ""product"" market was involved; (2) the 
conduct took place during or immediately after a collective-bargaining negotiation; (3) the conduct grew out of, and was directly 
related to, the lawful operation of the collective bargaining process; (4) the conduct was an accepted practice of labor 
negotiations that has been extensively regulated and carefully circumscribed; (5) the conduct involved a matter that the parties 
were required to negotiate collectively; and (6) the conduct concerned only the parties to the collective-bargaining relationship. 
Brown, 518 U.S. at 250; Safeway, 651 F.3d at 1129, 1130, 1130 n. 7. "
1185,6," In its brief in response to the motion to dismiss, ICTSI argues that its antitrust counterclaim is also based on a May 23, 2012 
CLRC ""agreement"" between ILWU and PMA. ICTSI Resp. Br. at 17-18. No such ""agreement"" was alleged in ICTSI's 
counterclaims, and if it were, it would not be a proper characterization of the May 23, 2012 meeting. As ICTSI properly alleges, 
on May 23, 2012, the CLRC held a meeting and interpreted the PCLCD as requiring the reefer work be assigned to ILWU-
represented workers. This is an interpretation of the PCLCD, not a separate agreement entered into between PMA and ILWU. 
Further, as alleged by ICTSI, it is the role of the CLRC to interpret the PCLCD."
1185,7," ICTSI also alleges that PMA and ILWU work in concert to create a monopoly for PMA members in the market of loading and 
unloading of freight, and related ancillary services, in West Coast ports.  [**28] Such conduct would affect nonparties to the "
1186,," PCLCD (e.g., non-PMA members who wish to perform such work and cannot). As discussed in Section A.4 below, however, the 
Court finds that ICTSI fails to state a claim for monopolization, attempted monopolization, or conspiracy to monopolize, so this 
conduct is not relevant to the Court's analysis on the application of the nonstatutory labor exemption."
1186,8," Although the dispute at Terminal 6 affects persons who are not parties to the agreement, including the public, businesses who 
ship through Terminal 6, and the Port, this is not the type of effect encompassed in the first prong of the Mackey test. All alleged 
anticompetitive conduct has some effect on consumers and competitors, but courts look to the primary effect of the alleged 
agreement and whether the alleged agreement ""imposes its terms on any nonsignatory party."" Phoenix Elec., 81 F.3d at 862. 
Here, the alleged agreement is the PCLCD, and it does not impose the requirement that ILWU-represented workers be assigned 
reefer work on any nonsignatory party. "
1188,9," ICTSI also cites to United States v. Am. Airlines, 743 F.2d 1114 (5th Cir. 1984), which is distinguishable. In that case, the Fifth 
Circuit held that an offer to fix prices among two competitors who collectively controlled the market for a relevant period of time 
due to regulatory constraints was an attempt to monopolize in violation Section 2. Such a price-fixing agreement would have 
resulted in the equivalent of a single-firm price-setting, which is the essence of monopolization. That is not what oligopolies do. "

1189,13," PMA argues that California law should apply because the allegations involve PMA's ""internal affairs"" and any duty would arise 
out of California state law governing non-profit mutual benefit organizations. PMA Br.  [**41] at 18, 21. Dkt. 132. The Court finds 
that the fiduciary relationship stems from the agency relationship between a principal and its agent, however, and not PMA's 
corporate status. Additionally, the specific allegations from which the Court determines that ICTSI states a counterclaim for 
breach of fiduciary duty do not involve PMA's ""internal affairs."" The Court applies Oregon law, however, the choice of law is "
1190,," immaterial to the outcome because, as PMA and ICTSI both concede, Oregon and California law on claims for breach of 
fiduciary do not conflict."
1190,14," PMA also argues that because it is a California non-profit mutual benefit corporation, it does not owe any fiduciary duties to 
ICTSI. Whether PMA's status as a non-profit mutual benefit corporation gives rise to fiduciary obligations is irrelevant, however, 
because the Court finds that it is PMA's status as an agent of ICTSI that gives rise to fiduciary obligations. Non-profit mutual 
benefit corporations do not necessarily act as agents to their members, and PMA cites to no authority that, when non-profit 
mutual benefit corporations do act as an agent, their status as a non-profit mutual corporation negates agency principles."

1191,16," There is no allegation that PMA did not fully disclose to ICTSI the fact that it represents other principals or other facts that 
ICTSI should know before joining the PMA. "
1195,17," Such claims may, however, be preempted by Section 301. See, e.g., Scott v. Machinists Automotive Trades Dist. Lodge No. 
190 of N. Cal., 827 F.2d 589, 591 (9th Cir. 1987). As discussed above, Section 301 preemption does not apply to ICTSI's breach 
of fiduciary duty counterclaim."

Mallinckrodt only when explaining the Federal Circuit's reasoning in two cases decided pre-Quanta. Monsanto, 657 F.3d at 
1347. Its decision, however, did not endorse those principles, holding that even if the patents had been exhausted as to the first 
generation self-replicating seeds, no authorized sale had occurred to exhaust the right in the second generation seeds. Id. As for

1272,6," Under a wholesale model, a retailer such as Amazon purchases e-books from publishers and resells them to consumers at a

motion for class certification would define the class so as to  [*21] exclude individuals described in 28 U.S.C. § 455(b)(4)-(5)."
1276,10," On September 30, 2013, plaintiffs requested permission for Noll to file a rebuttal report. The Court granted this request on 
October 3, also ordering that ""[t]o the extent the plaintiffs' rebuttal report includes new opinions that could not have been 
anticipated by Apple's expert(s), Apple may file a sur-reply report."""
1276,11," The motion to strike is denied as to the first two paragraphs of the memorandum and the four paragraphs beginning with the 
first full paragraph on page 4."
1276,12," The  [*23] motion to strike is granted as to the following portions of Kalt's sur-reply: paragraphs 22-29, 39-43, 58-59, 71, 76, 
81, 86, and 88-91; and figures 2A-2F, 3, 8A-8B, 11A-11B, and 18. "
1277,13," Noll's ""competitive benchmark"" includes sales of e-books from Hachette, HarperCollins, Macmillan, and Simon & Schuster 
between June 8, 2008 and April 1, 2010, and sales of e-books from Penguin between June 8, 2008 and May 26, 2010. It is not 
clear from Noll's declaration whether Penguin sales between May 26 and May 31 are considered pre- or post-agency."
1277,14," Noll's use of these benchmarks creates a conservative model that likely underestimates damages. After all, the prices of titles 
from other publishers may well have risen because of the price-fixing of their major competitors. Thus, Noll's ""competitive 
benchmark""  [*26] may well include prices that were inflated by collusion."
1277,15," A hedonic pricing model -- ""hedonic"" from the Greek meaning pleasure, as the method relates to consumers' desires -- 
measures the effect of various product attributes on price. See Freeland v. AT&T Corp., 238 F.R.D. 130, 149 n.15 (S.D.N.Y. 
2006)."
1277,16, This variable incorporates data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis of the U.S. Department of Commerce. 
1278,17," In addition, Noll includes a variable to account for the effects of Amazon's removal of the ""buy button"" from listings for all 
Macmillan titles, including e-books, between January 29 and February 6, 2010."
1278,18," ""Multiple regression analysis is a statistical tool used to understand the relationship between or among two or more variables. 
[It] involves a variable to be explained -- called the dependent variable -- and additional explanatory variables that are thought to 
produce or be associated with changes in the dependent variable."" Federal Judicial Center, Reference Manual on Scientific 
Evidence, 305 (3d ed. 2011); see also Lavin-McEleney v. Marist Coll., 239 F.3d 476, 482 (2d Cir. 2001) (noting, in sex 
discrimination case, that ""[i]t is undisputed that multiple regression analysis . . . is a scientifically valid statistical technique for 
identifying discrimination""); Bickerstaff v. Vassar Coll., 196 F.3d 435, 448 (2d Cir. 1999) (recognizing that ""multiple regression 
analysis [is] a commonly accepted method of statistical analysis for examining the effect of independent variables on a 
dependent variable"")."
1278,19," Textbooks fall outside the relevant market definition: trade e-books in the United States. Liability Opinion, 952 F. Supp. 2d at 
694 n.60."
1278,20," While  [*29] there are 720 possible combinations of these variables for the Publisher Defendants' e-books, there are 1008 
possible combinations for any given e-book: seven possible publisher values (one for each of the Big Six, and one for other), six 
genre categories, two possible values for the hardcover edition variable, two possible values for the paperback edition variable, 
and then three possible values for the title's age (new release, other frontlist, or backlist). "
1279,21," This is the adjusted R2 of Dr. Noll's initial model, not his later model that used individual transaction prices rather than four-
week averages. The parties have not suggested that the adjusted R2 of the later model is substantially different, although 
Apple's experts have re-run both of Noll's regressions and calculated related R2 statistics for both models. "
1280,22," In a footnote, Apple refers to a September 27, 2013 letter it provided to the Court. To the extent Apple has made an argument 
in the text of its opposition to the motion for certification, it has been considered. The Court declines Apple's invitation to review 
as well its September 27 letter for any arguments  [*36] it might include that may be relevant to this motion practice. "
1282,23," As noted above, Penguin did not sign its agency contract with Amazon until June 2, 2010. Liability Opinion, 952 F. Supp. 2d at 
682."
1282,24," Class plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment on collateral estoppel grounds is still pending before the Court. But how 
and where collateral estoppel applies is a class-wide issue, just as relitigation of any particular issue covered by the Liability 
Opinion would be based on class-wide evidence. "
1283,25," For the first time in its reply brief in support of its motion to exclude Noll's opinions, Apple contends  [*43] that a class should 
not be certified because Noll ""disregards factors that would affect the price for a given transaction, including authors' reputations, 
reviews, events such as a movie release of the title, 'buzz' and 'word-of-mouth' effects, and advertising and other marketing 
effects."" Apple could have raised this argument in its initial brief in opposition to class certification, but chose not to. Accordingly, 
the argument is waived. See Conn. Bar Ass'n v. United States, 620 F.3d 81, 91 n.13 (2d Cir. 2010) (""Issues raised for the first 
time in a reply brief are generally deemed waived.""). Even if the argument were not waived, it would be easily dismissed. As Noll has explained, his regression does capture effects 
specific to an individual title, as it includes an ""indicator variable"" for every e-book title. Noll's indicator variables are not perfect, 
as they must average these effects over time, but they allow his model to account for the idiosyncratic pricing influences on each 
e-book title."
1283,26," The reliability and admissibility of Kalt's work, including this figure, is discussed in the Opinion issued today addressing the 
motions to strike Kalt's and Orszag's expert opinions. "
1284,27," Apple's expert, Orszag, provides lengthy opinions regarding another proposed benefit: cheaper e-reader prices. Apple has 
elected not to raise this as a reason to deny class certification."
1284,28," Whether or not collateral estoppel applies, Apple does not dispute that these issues are subject to class-wide evidence and 
argument in the class action."
1284,29," This is equivalent to multiplying the relative overcharge by the actual purchase prices, as a but-for price is equal to the 
difference between the actual price and the overcharge. "
1286,30," In Freeland v. AT&T Corp., 238 F.R.D. 130, 150 (S.D.N.Y. 2006), this Court adopted the ""package"" approach in antitrust tying 
cases. Because a tying theory is based on the link between the tying and tied products, the Court held that damages should be 
set at the net amount plaintiffs were overcharged (or undercharged) for the tied and tying products. Id."
1286,31, The plaintiffs vigorously dispute that Apple's experts have accurately described the path of e-book prices. 
1288,32," Apple's charge that Noll's model impermissibly aggregates data by using four-week average prices for e-books rather than 
transaction prices has been mooted, as Noll subsequently offered a damages model based on individual transaction prices. "
1289,33," Apple argues that many class members may not have been injured, based on Kalt's opinions that most e-book prices did not 
increase as a result of price fixing and that Noll's model produces millions of false positives. As discussed in today's Opinion 
deciding the States' and class plaintiffs' motions to exclude Apple's experts'  [*67] opinions, both of these analyses are 
fundamentally flawed and inadmissible. Kalt's finding that most e-book prices did not increase depends on his misclassification 
of prices set by Penguin under the agency model as ""pre-agency"" prices. And Kalt's false positives analysis turns on his 
comparison of actual transaction prices to average but-for prices: his finding of ""false positives"" simply reflects the fact that 
actual prices for a given e-book were both above and below that e-book's average price. "
1292,34," In particular, Noll noted that multicollinearity among the variables could be one reason useful variables appear not to be 
statistically significant. Multicollinearity occurs when several variables are correlated with each other -- that is, they overlap in the 
sense that they each capture some part of the same effect -- such that it is impossible  [*80] from the data set to objectively 
determine the influence of one variable as opposed to the influence of these others. See Freeland, 238 F.R.D. at 147 & n.13. In 
that case, a model might estimate a smaller coefficient (influence) for one variable and a greater coefficient for other correlated 
variables; while the overall effect of these variables may be strongly statistically significant, each coefficient may not appear "
1293,," statistically significant on its own. Such an effect is noted in a resource upon which Apple's expert, Kalt, relies. See Jeffrey M. 
Wooldridge, Introductory Econometrics: A Modern Approach, 148-49 (5th ed. 2013) (setting out an example where jointly 
significant variables appear singly insignificant due to multicollinearity)."
1293,35," In its reply, Apple shifts the focus of its attack on Noll's opinion and contends that he failed to consider that there would have 
been higher e-reader prices in the but-for world. Because Apple elected to raise this argument for the first time in its reply -- thus 
preventing plaintiffs from responding -- Apple has waived it. See Conn. Bar Ass'n, 620 F.3d at 91 n.13 (""Issues raised for the first 
time in a reply brief are generally deemed waived.""). "
1294,36," While some comparisons between competitive and collusive transaction prices concern the same e-book title sold pre- and 
post-agency, and thus the effect of collusion implicates ""within"" variance rather than ""between"" variance, this is only a subset of 
such comparisons. "
1295,37," Within a stricken portion of Kalt's sur-reply, Apple has offered a study performed by Kalt of the percentage of Noll's but-for 
prices that fall within 50 cents of $9.99. It does not appear, at first blush, that that study makes any attempt to isolate the extent "
1296,," to which the predicted prices of New Releases and NYT Bestsellers fall close to $9.99. In any event, the plaintiffs have not had 
an opportunity to respond to this calculation and it will not be further considered here."
1296,38," Apple was free to conduct its own regression study with other variables, but has elected not to do so. "
1297,39," Apple did not cite any cases in its request for a hearing on its motion to exclude Noll's opinions, which was fully submitted on 
January 21, 2014. It first presented argument in favor of a hearing weeks later -- on February 21 -- in its opposition to class 
plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment. In that brief, Apple requested a hearing on plaintiffs' motions to exclude Apple's experts, 
which had also been fully submitted weeks earlier, on February 4. "
1302,1," Defendants that move to dismiss are: The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ,  [*7] Ltd.; Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking 
Corporation; The Bank of Yokohama, Ltd.; Barclays Bank PLC; Citibank, N.A.; Citigroup Inc.; Cooperatieve Centrale Raiffeisen-
Boerenleenbank B.A.; Deutsche Bank AG; HSBC Holdings plc; HSBC Bank plc; ICAP plc; JPMorgan Chase & Co.; JPMorgan

Group,plc; Royal Bank of Scotland plc; RBS Securities Japan Limited; UBS AG; UBS Securities Japan Co., Ltd (ECF 204). "
1306,2," Defendants also move to dismiss Plaintiff's claim for vicarious liability (second claim for relief). Plaintiff has not alleged: (1) the 
principal's manifestation of intent to grant authority to the agent; (2) agreement by the agent; and (3) the principal must also 
maintain control over key aspects of the undertaking. In re Amaranth, 587 F. Supp. 2d at 531. Accordingly, Plaintiff's second 
claim for relief is dismissed. "
1307,3," As the antitrust claim is dismissed  [*27] for lack of antitrust standing and restraint of trade, the remaining issues are not 
decided. "
1316,1," The Court, however, found that it did have subject matter jurisdiction over the dispute and that Sky Angel had standing. See 
Sky Angel I, 947 F. Supp. 2d at 97-99, 105-07. "
1317,2," Section 4 of the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914, 15 U.S.C. § 15 (2012), creates a private, civil right of action for violations of 
section 1 of the Sherman Act. "
1318,3," C-SPAN's motion also contains a boilerplate reincorporation of its earlier argument that the Court lacks subject matter 
jurisdiction due to a program access dispute between Sky Angel and Discovery Communications currently pending before the 
Federal Communications Commission. See C-SPAN's Mot. Dismiss Am. Compl. 13. Because C-SPAN raises no new arguments 
in its motion, the Court simply directs the parties to the discussion of subject matter jurisdiction contained in the Court's first 
Memorandum Opinion.  [**10] See Sky Angel I, 947 F. Supp. 2d at 97-99 (concluding that the Court has subject matter 
jurisdiction over this case). "
1319,4," This conclusory assertion, as well as the proposed interrogatories at issue in the pending discovery motion, signal that Sky 
Angel is, at bottom, still relying on an agency theory for its section 1 claim. See Pl.'s Proposed Interrog. No. 2, ECF No. 19-2 
(""[I]dentify any and all members of [the board] who authorized or ratified a delegation of authority to any other person, which 
authority included discontinuing Sky Angel's distribution of [the C-SPAN networks]."")."
1319,5," Sky Angel also argues that general statements made by cable executives about ""protecting the ecosystem"" by contractually 
prohibiting online distribution of content enhances plausibility. See Pl.'s Opp'n Mot. Dismiss Am. Compl. 13. Because these 
allegations are not contained in the complaint—nor does the complaint even identify the individual speakers as C-SPAN board 
 [**16] members—the Court does not consider them. Moreover, the statements would not be relevant, because Sky Angel 
alleges that the antitrust conduct was the termination of the IPTV Agreement, not the inclusion of a contractual prohibition 
limiting the authorized method of distribution (which Sky Angel seems to allege it did not breach, see infra note 6)."
1319,6," While Sky Angel seemingly disputes whether it breached the IPTV Agreement, see Am. Compl. ¶ 7 (""Sky Angel's distribution 
system does not allow for 'public' internet access.""); id. ¶ 28 (alleging that termination of the agreement ""had no legitimate or 
lawful purpose""), the relevant inquiry is whether it is plausible that Mr. Kiley's asserted basis for terminating the contract was 
pretextual. Sky Angel's own description of its distribution method ""over highspeed internet connections to set-top boxes[,]"" id., 
suggests that C-SPAN did believe that Sky Angel's distribution method was not authorized, as does Sky Angel's decision not to 
assert a breach of contract claim."
1319,7," Because the Court dismisses Sky Angel's amended complaint for failure to plead facts that plausibly suggest the existence of 
an agreement, the Court need not decide whether a properly pleaded claim would withstand the rule of reason. In light of the 
parties' rather conclusory briefing on the thorny threshold issue of whether Sky Angel's claim should be analyzed under the rule 
of reason, instead of a per se rule, the Court finds it inappropriate to proceed with that analysis at this juncture. "
1320,8," Sky Angel, for a second time, couches its proposed discovery requests as seeking only the ""identity"" of particular defendants, 
even though the identities of C-SPAN's directors are publicly available. Moreover, the nature of Sky Angel's proposed 
interrogatories again raises suspicion that Sky Angel is in fact seeking confirmation of  [**19] its conclusory conspiracy 
allegations. This case is not like common copyright cases in which a plaintiff sues Does linked to specific IP addresses alleged 
to have downloaded copyrighted material, and then seeks only to identify the individuals who use those IP addresses. Rather, 
Sky Angel seeks to have C-SPAN confirm, by ""identifying"" Does, that a majority of C-SPAN board members authorized or 
ratified the termination of the IPTV Agreement or delegated to someone else authority that included the power to terminate the 
IPTV Agreement. See Pl.'s Proposed Interrog. Nos. 1-2, ECF No. 19-2. "
1323,1," Hachette Book Group, Inc., HarperCollins Publishers LLC, Holtzbrinck Publishers LLC d/b/a Macmillan, Penguin Group (USA), 
Inc. (""Penguin""), and Simon & Schuster, Inc. (""Simon & Shuster"") (collectively, ""Publisher Defendants"")."
1323,2, Today's class certification Opinion grants certification without reaching the admissibility of Kalt's and Orszag's opinions.
1323,3," There is no dispute that these findings bind the parties  [*4] in the States Action. The class plaintiffs expect to rely on the 
doctrine of collateral estoppel and do not intend to retry Apple's liability for violating the antitrust laws. A pending motion for 
summary judgment is addressed to issues of collateral estoppel. To the extent that this brief summary of the Liability Opinion's 
findings differs in any way from the findings as set out in the Liability Opinion itself, the Liability Opinion controls. "
1324,4," For contractual reasons unique to  [*6] Penguin, it was unable to execute its agency agreement with Amazon as quickly as the 
other Publisher Defendants. When it did so later in the Spring of 2010, its e-book prices followed the same path as the other co-
defendant publishers."
1324,5," This is the adjusted R2 of Noll's initial model, not his later model that used individual transaction prices rather than four-week 
averages. The parties have not suggested that the adjusted R2 of the later model is substantially different, although Apple's 
experts have re-run both of Noll's regressions and calculated related R2 statistics for both models. "
1325,6," This description of the legal standard is identical to the one given in today's class certification Opinion, but is repeated here for 
ease of reference. "
1326,7," Plaintiffs complain that despite his frequent appearance  [*13] as an expert, Kalt has ""never concluded in testimony or an 
expert report that a plaintiff can show impact or damages through common proof, despite addressing that issue in numerous 
cases."" Were Kalt's opinions not excluded, plaintiffs would be permitted to explore that pattern, and its implied bias, through 
cross-examination. This Opinion does not rely upon plaintiffs' charge as a ground for excluding Kalt's opinions."
1326,8," This criticism was levelled at Noll's initial model, which used four-week average prices for titles rather than individual 
transaction prices. "
1327,9," The Opinion issued today that grants class certification includes a reference to Kalt's statistics as they were described in 
Apple's brief in opposition to the class certification motion. In that brief, Apple describes Kalt's opinion as ""over 50% of the 
Publisher Defendants' e-book titles' prices decreased or stayed the same after the switch to agency."""
1327,10," This same type of error affected Kalt's initial analysis of Simon & Schuster e-books. Because the description of the error in 
connection with Penguin e-books is sufficient to elucidate the problem, it is unnecessary to also describe the problem with the 
analysis of the Simon & Schuster sales. "
1328,11," Kalt makes a brief reference in his sur-reply report to the existence of ""MFN provisions in Apple's agency agreements with 
retailers."" As described in the Liability Opinion, 952 F. Supp. 2d at 662-63, under the Most-Favored-Nation clause that Apple 
insisted be included in its Agreements with the Publisher Defendants, the Publisher Defendants were essentially forced to move 
all of their e-tailers to an agency model and Apple was protected against any retail price competition. But, Kalt  [*20] brings no 
expert analysis to bear on the effect of the MFN on retail pricing. And, as already described, he does not dispute the accuracy of 
Ashenfelter's study of retail pricing during the weeks before Penguin took control of that pricing from Amazon. Thus, whatever 
the impact of the MFN over time, it did not prevent Penguin from raising the prices for its e-books at Apple and Barnes & Noble 
as it waited for its agency agreement with Amazon to take effect. The bottom line remains that there is no sound basis for Kalt to 
label an e-book sold pursuant to an agency agreement a ""pre-agency"" transaction."
1328,12," A New Release, as defined by Amazon, is a book published within the last 90 days; a frontlist book is one sold within a year of 
its publication."
1328,13," Note that Kalt's repetition of his flawed  [*22] analysis was not considered in connection with the class certification Opinion, as 
it was untimely. It did not respond to a new opinion by Noll that could not have been anticipated by Kalt. It is only addressed here 
to explain why consideration of this analysis would not save Kalt's opinion from exclusion at summary judgment and at trial. "
1330,14," Apple's only citation is to an essay published in the ABA's Section of Antitrust Law's Economics Committee Newsletter 
authored by two other consultants at Compass Lexecon, the expert consulting firm that employs both Kalt and Orszag. Andrew 
Y. Lemon & Steven R. Peterson, ""Using Economics to Identify Common Impact in Antitrust Class Certification,"" Economics 
Committee Newsletter (ABA Section of Antitrust Law), Spring 2011, at 3-6. Kalt cites to a similar article published by these 
authors. Steven R. Peterson & Andrew Y. Lemon, ""Rigorous Analysis to Bridge the Inference Gap in Class Certification,"" 7 
Journal of Competition Law & Econ. 93 (2010). In these  [*27] writings, Peterson and Lemon propose grounds for denying class 
certification in antitrust actions in all but a few ""special cases."" Id. at 105. It is unnecessary to engage with the merits of the Peterson/Lemon thesis since their economic analysis is not applicable here. 
Peterson and Lemon simply note that, where actual prices overlap with but-for prices and there is no reliable way to match a 
given actual price with a given but-for price, it may be impossible to calculate an individual's damages with certainty on a class-
wide basis. Here, where Noll's model calculates an overcharge for each of 502 different categories of e-books, and a but-for 
price is determined by multiplying the appropriate overcharge by the actual transaction price paid by an individual class member, 
plaintiffs have presented a reliable method of matching actual prices with but-for prices and determining individual damages."
1330,15," Plaintiffs' expert, Noll, also uses transaction records. Unlike Kalt, however, Noll does not proffer analyses based on price 
changes on a given day or week."
1330,16," Kalt reports that 96% of e-books sell approximately 25 units a year. Plaintiffs  [*30] appear to interpret Kalt to be referring to 
sales over the lifetime of an e-book, rather than yearly sales; if plaintiffs are correct, sales are even less frequent than once 
every two weeks. "
1331,17," It is not clear whether the transaction records from any or all of the e-tailers differentiate between a promotional price (which 
may be offered to a small subset of shoppers) and a general offer price. Kalt does not indicate that he was able to distinguish 
between promotional and ordinary prices. Given the small number of transactions for each title, occasional purchases at 
promotional rates may generate the appearance of substantial price volatility."
1331,18," The modal price is the most frequent price charged over a given period of time. For example, on a day where a given e-book 
was sold for $14.99, $14.98, $14.95, $3.99, and $3.99, the daily modal price would be $3.99."
1331,19," Kalt refers to Figures 12A-F and 13A-F in his discussion of churning, but because the same methodological problem afflicts 
Figures 9-13, they are treated together. "
1333,20, The discussion that follows is also contained in today's Opinion certifying a class. 
1335,21," Orszag also speculates that Amazon may even have raised e-book prices but for the conspiracy.  [*48] This is so far-fetched, 
given the record at trial, that it would have been particularly incumbent upon Orszag to point to reliable evidence supporting such 
speculation. He has not. "
1336,22," Orszag admits that he  [*50] cannot determine whether, or to what extent, in the absence of the price-fixing conspiracy, the 
price of Kindles would have decreased less or Amazon would have chosen independently to raise the Publisher Defendants' e-
book prices. It should be noted that these two ""benefit"" theories arise from entirely different assumptions. Orszag is assuming 
that the drop in Kindle prices that did occur was due to the conspiracy that raised e-book prices; and he is assuming that 
Amazon would have raised e-book prices if there had been no price-fixing conspiracy. Of course, the overwhelming evidence at 
trial was that no one expected Amazon to raise e-book prices; for this very reason the Publisher Defendants and Apple joined in 
a conspiracy to wrest pricing control from Amazon and raise those prices themselves. "
1338,23," Orszag discusses both free, self-published e-books and e-books provided free to readers by Apple, Amazon and Barnes & 
Noble. Some or perhaps most of these free e-books were already available on the internet through Project Gutenberg. Orszag 
does not contend that any free e-book title was made available by Apple only. "
1339,24," To arrive at the 15% figure, Orszag looked at the percentage of Apple customers who purchased three or fewer e-books and 
the percentage of Apple customers who do not  [*60] own a Kindle. He does not discuss whether there is any basis to find these 
two sets of Apple customers overlap or whether such an overlap is material to this choice of a 15% figure. "
1340,25," Apple did not request a hearing in its January 21 opposition to plaintiffs' motions to exclude, which were fully submitted on 
February 4, 2014. It first requested a hearing on these motions weeks later, in its February 21 opposition to class plaintiffs' 
motion for summary judgment."
1340,26, Much of this discussion also appears in the class certification Opinion; it is reproduced here for ease of reference. 
1343,1," Unless otherwise indicated, all references to docket numbers in this order are to the docket in this case (Brown v. Stroud)."
1343,2," According to the complaint, SPE was dissolved in 1981, and since that time, Andrew B. Stroud has been doing business under 
the fictitious name SPE. Id. "
1348,3," The Southern District of New York granted Brown's motion to dismiss that case without prejudice under the prior pending action 
doctrine, to allow the salient  [*22] issues to be resolved in the Brown v. Stroud action. Andy Stroud, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
18725, 2009 WL 539863, *1. "
1349,4," Scarlett Stroud is named in the interpleader action as ""Scarlett Paradies-Stroud."" Id. "
1351,5," In an order issued April 2, 2013, the Court noted that Robinson purported to file the motion for reconsideration on behalf of SPE 
and ASI, despite the fact that he has filed pro hac vice applications only on behalf of Scarlett Stroud and the Stroud Estate. Dkt. 
No. 553 at 2. The Court stated that, unless and until Robinson properly files pro hac vice applications on behalf of SPE 
 [*36] and ASI, and the Court grants such applications, he cannot appear on behalf of SPE and ASI and, thus, does not have the 
authority to file motions on their behalf. Id. "
1352,6," The Simone Estate's motion seeks default judgment of declaratory relief against the ""Stroud Defendants"" which it defines as 
including ASI. See, e.g., Dkt. No. 530 at 2:3-10, 2:21-22,  [*37] 7:6, 8:4-7, 11:9-10. The First Amended Counterclaims based 
upon which the Simone Estate moves for default judgment, however, refer to ""Stroud"" which is defined as Andrew B. Stroud and 
SPE, not ASI. Dkt. Nos. 263 at 2:9-11, 13:15; 530 at 8:9-13; 531-1. Similarly, Brown's default judgment motion asserts that 
declaratory judgment is appropriate against ""Defendants"" which it defines as including ASI. Dkt. No. 522 at 4:2-5, 6:18-19. 
Brown moves for default judgment on his First Amended Complaint and his Reply Counterclaims, which are only against Andrew 
B. Stroud and SPE, not ASI. Dkt. Nos. 35, 82. ASI did not appear in this action until the Fourth Amended Counterclaims, which 
post-date the pleadings upon which Brown and the Simone Estate's claims are based, and which were dismissed by the Court, 
finding among other things that ASI was not properly joined as a party. See Dkt. Nos. 297, 337. Furthermore, the combined 
proposed judgment submitted in support of the pending default judgment motions in this case does not include ASI. Dkt. No. 524 
at 2:4-6, 2:14-15. "
1355,7, [ILLEGIBLE FOOTNOTE] 
1356,8," Brown prayed for a declaratory judgment that he ""is the legal or beneficial owner of the disputed Nina Simone recordings and 
audiovisual works,"" Dkt. No. 82 at 13:6-7. Additionally, there is a declaratory relief claim by Brown against Sony Music. Brown 
does not request adjudication of those claimed ownership interests here."
1356,9," In  [*56] addition to his reply counterclaims, Brown also alleges a declaratory relief claim in his First Amended Complaint. In 
that claim, Brown seeks a declaratory judgment ""that defendants have no right, title, nor interest in any of the Disputed Masters."" 
Dkt. No. 35 at 5:18-20. In his motion for default judgment Brown explains that the ""Disputed Masters"" is a subset of the 
recordings resolved by Brown's reply counterclaims and should not be separately considered unless the Court declines to award 
the declaratory relief Brown prayed for in the reply counterclaims. Dkt. No. 522 at 10 n.8. "
1359,10," Brown's Reply Counterclaims include a separate cause of action seeking an order allowing copying of Nina Simone recordings 
and audiovisual works under the All Writs Act. Dkt. No. 82 at 12-13. In an order dated January 8, 2011, the Court granted 
Andrew Stroud and SPE's motion to dismiss the Estate's claim under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651 on the basis that it is 
not a separate claim for relief. Dkt. No. 251 at 18-19. See Lights of America, Inc. v United States District Court, 130 F. 3d 1369, 
1370 (9th Cir 1997) (""[C]ourts must possess an independent source of jurisdiction before entertaining a request for a writ""). The 
Simone Estate's First Amended Counterclaims removed the independent claim under the All Writs Act but continued seeking 
relief under that Act. Dkt. No. 263 at 13, 21. "
1360,," While the Court agrees that it also has the authority to provide such injunctive relief under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651 as 
""necessary or appropriate"" in aid of the court's jurisdiction, it need not invoke that authority in light of its finding that relief is 
appropriate under 28 U.S.C. § 2202. See Pa. Bureau of Corr. v. United States Marshals Serv., 474 U.S. 34, 41-43, 106 S. Ct. 
355, 88 L. Ed. 2d 189 (1985). "
1361,11," Brown also asserts that Andrew Stroud and SPE's licensing of Nina Simone recordings  [*71] in which they have no rights of 
reproduction is proscribed by California Civil Code § 980. Dkt. No. 82 at 12."
1361,12," In ruling on Andrew Stroud and SPE's motion to dismiss the Simone Estate's counterclaims, the District Court previously held 
that the tangible property sought to be recovered by the Simone Estate was described with sufficient certainty to withstand a 
motion to dismiss. Dkt. No. 251 at 16-17. The court concluded that the primary property defined as the ""Simone Materials"" and 
sought to be returned are the personal diaries of Simone identified in the complaint. Id. "
1362,13," The Court previously denied Andrew B. Stroud and SPE's motion to dismiss the Estate's conversion claim for failure to state a 
claim and rejected the argument that the Estate's claim for replevin is not  [*75] a separate claim for relief. Dkt. No. 251 at 11-12, 
15-16. The Court, however, dismissed the conversion and replevin claims, with leave to amend, based on its conclusion that the 
Simone Estate failed to allege sufficient facts to show that the statute of limitations should be tolled. Dkt. No. 251 at 11:18-22:2. 
Subsequently, by its order dated August 10, 2011, this Court denied Andrew B. Stroud and SPE's renewed motion to dismiss 
these claims, concluding that the Simone Estate had alleged facts demonstrating a fiduciary duty and showing that the discovery 
rule applied to toll the statute of limitations as to the claims for conversion and replevin. Dkt. No. 309 at 3-5. "
1369,1," DFA defines beauty products as ""goods used to enhance appearance or smell"" and further subdivides beauty products into the 
three subcategories of makeup, skincare, and fragrances. (ECF No. 143 at 8.) Cosmetics is the industry term for makeup and 
skincare products. "
1370,2," These wholesale prices to duty-free operators are based on a discount of the suggested retail price. So when ELC increased 
its suggested retail price in 2008, the prices duty-free operators had to pay increased as well."
1370,3," Although DFA's Amended Complaint is noticeably silent on who terminated the business relationship, DFA's attorney admitted 
at the hearing on ELC's motion to dismiss that it was DFA that terminated the relationship, not ELC. "
1372,4," DFA's Amended Complaint alleges that ""DFA/Stellar listed ELC brands in the Orlando bid with respect to the duty free store to 
be operated by Stellar."" (ECF No. 143 at 25.) Given that this factual allegation is undercut by an Exhibit DFA attaches to its own 
Amended Complaint, and given that Brown  [*15] rejected this precise explanation after giving DFA and Stellar a formal 
opportunity to address this issue at an appeal hearing, the Court need not—and does not—accept this particular ""factual"" 
allegation by DFA. "
1373,5," DFA alleges in the Amended Complaint that the ""DFA/Stellar bid proposed to pay millions of dollars more in rent than any other 
bidder over the life of the contract."" Given the persuasive logical reasoning on Brown on this very point, the Court accepts that if 
DFA sold the same amount as other operators, then DFA would pay more to the  [*20] Orlando Airport. But for the reasons 
outlined by Brown, it is plausible that another bidder could pay as much or more to the Orlando Airport over the life of the 
contract by selling more than DFA does. "
1374,6," Technically, the bid was submitted by Aldeasa, which is a subsidiary of Autogrill. World Duty Free (WDF) is a trading name of 
Autogrill. "
1376,7," DFA alleges that it is an innovator in the duty-free industry that ""is able to increase gross sales at airports above what other 
duty free operators are capable of achieving through its innovative displays, product offerings, marketing techniques, and 
business model."" (ECF No. 143 at 14.) "
1378,8," DFA's original complaint did allege an antitrust conspiracy between ELC and other duty-free operators that violated § 2, but the 
Court found that  [*37] claim invalid and dismissed it. DFA has not repled it. DFA's only antitrust count is that ELC itself 
attempted to form a monopoly. There are no conspiracy allegations. "
1379,9," Although there is a four-year statute of limitations on damage actions under 15 U.S.C. 15b, there is no limitations period 
specified in 15 U.S.C. § 26, the antitrust law that authorizes suits for injunctive relief by private parties. "
1380,10," DFA asserts that customers who benefit from DFA's competitive conduct and the airport authorities  [*45] who forgo the 
additional revenue from DFA's bid are also injured, but their injury is derivative and premised on DFA losing duty-free airport 
contracts. (ECF No. 168 at 12.) "
1381,11," Indeed, Brown, the executive director of the Orlando Airport Authority called Bottrie as part of that RFP process. (ECF No. 
143, Ex. 17.)"
1381,12," Although DFA does allege that ELC's letter to Newark was unsolicited, unprovoked, and ""was and is unprecedented in the 
duty free airport concession industry,"" DFA does not allege that the letter violated a rule, a failure which is all the more striking 
since in the Court's Order on ELC's motion to dismiss the original Complaint, the Court specifically rejected DFA's allegation that 
the letter was improper as a legal conclusion not supported by facts because ""DFA has not alleged that rules prohibited other 
entities from contacting the decision makers to inform them who they thought would be good duty-free operators."" (ECF No. 119 
at 9 n.7.) "
1391,1," Plaintiff had discussed these potential government code and local government code infractions in her Response in Opposition 
to the Motion to Dismiss (see Doc. No. 74 in Case No. 10-cv-1103, at 22-24.) It is not exactly clear, however, whether Plaintiff 
sought to hold LexisNexis accountable for the violations or just the governmental defendants. "
1393,2," HN6[
] The Fifth Circuit has determined that, in some cases, it can be appropriate to resolve the existence of antitrust injury 
and standing on the pleadings. See PSKS, Inc. v. Leegin Creative Leather Products, Inc., 615 F.3d 412, 419-20 (5th Cir. 2010). "
1394,3," For the purposes of this Memorandum and Order, the Court assumes, without deciding, that Plaintiffs have shown an injury that 
would be cognizable as antitrust injury. "
1395,4," Tex. Gov't Code § 51.803 reads: HN11[
] (a) The supreme court shall adopt rules and procedures to regulate the use of electronic  [**23] copying devices 
for filing in the courts. (b) An instrument may only be filed as provided by this subchapter if the district, county, or court of appeals has established 
a system for receiving electronically transmitted information from an electronic copying device, and the system has been 
approved by the supreme court. A district or county clerk or clerk of a court of appeals who believes there is justification for 
use of an electronic filing system in the clerk's office must request approval of the system from the supreme court. The 
supreme court shall approve or disapprove the system and may withdraw approval any time the system does not meet its 
requirements."
1395,5," Tex. Gov't Code § 51.807 states: HN12[
] (a) The courts of a county may adopt local rules that govern the transmission and receipt of documents or reports 
stored or created in digital electronic or facsimile form and that provide for recognition of those documents as the original 
record for file or for evidentiary purposes. (b) The rules shall be submitted to the supreme court for review and adoption as a part of the overall plan or procedure for 
the electronic filing of documents."
1395,6," Tex. Gov't Code § 51.319 holds: HN13[
] The district clerk shall  [**24] collect the following fees for services performed by the clerk: (1) for performing services related to the matter of the estate of a deceased person or a minor transacted in the district 
court, the same fees allowed the county clerk for those services; (2) for serving process by certified or registered mail, the same fee that sheriffs and constables are authorized to charge for 
the service under Section 118.131, Local Government Code; and "
1396,," (3) for performing any other service prescribed or authorized by law for which no fee is set by law, a reasonable fee."
1396,7," The seminal cases on negligence per se confirm that a statute can only supply the applicable standard of care when the statute 
governs the conduct of the relevant Defendant. See, e.g., Cuyler v. United States, 362 F.3d 949, 952 (7th Cir. 2004) (Posner, J.) 
(explaining that, where the common law imposes a duty, a statute can supply the relevant standard of care and its violation can 
amount to prima facie evidence of negligence, but that, because Defendant's employees, as mere bystanders, owed Plaintiff no 
duty of care, a statute requiring that they report child abuse could not amount to prima facie evidence of negligence); Murray v. 
O & A Exp., Inc., 630 S.W.2d 633, 636 (Tex. 1982) (holding that trial court did not err in concluding that the violation of a statute 
requiring that idling or parked cars pull completely off of a highway, turn on warning lights, and place warning flares and 
reflectors on the highway amounted to negligence per se on the part of a driver who did neither of those  [**27] three things); De 
Haen v. Rockwood Sprinkler Co. of Massachusetts, 258 N.Y. 350, 179 N.E. 764 (N.Y. 1932) (acknowledging that, in a suit 
against construction workers, the violation of a statute directing construction works to employ certain safeguards can establish 
liability if the hazard that causes plaintiff's injury is of the same sort the statute is intended to protect against); Restatement 
(Second) of Torts § 288B cmt. b(1) (1965) (offering, as illustration, that: ""A statute, which is found to define a standard of conduct 
for the protection of persons on the highway against the risk of collision, provides that after sunset no person shall drive an 
unlighted vehicle on the highway. Without excuse, A drives an unlighted vehicle on the highway after sunset. As a result of the 
absence of lights, he collides with B's automobile and injures B. A's violation of the statute is negligence, which makes him 
subject to liability to B.""). "
1398,8," Though there is some support, including this Court's October 2012 Memorandum & Order, for the proposition that an 
""unconscionable act"" can be one that ""results in a gross disparity between the value received and consideration paid, in a 
transaction involving transfer of consideration,"" see McPeters II, 910 F. Supp. 2d at 988,  [**35] that particular half of 
unconscionability's definition was excised in 1995. See 1995 Tex. Sess. Law Serv. Ch. 414 (H.B. 668) (Vernon's). "
1401,9," It is not enough for Plaintiffs to say that, had they been permitted to file in a manner other than electronically, they would have 
done so. To countenance that argument would be to hold LexisNexis liable for the mere fact that e-filing was mandatory, even 
though it was the courts, and not LexisNexis, that required e-filing."
1401,10," These last two issues are not independent of one another; simple logic dictates that, the higher the prices, the easier it will be 
for Plaintiffs to show that they would have seized upon an alternative. But, just as the plaintiff who allegedly lacks knowledge 
must show that he would have behaved differently with the relevant information, Daugherty, 187 S.W.3d at 616, Plaintiffs here 
must show that, had they been provided options other than LexisNexis, they would have availed themselves thereof. To ignore 
that requirement would render ""takes advantage of"" in § 17.45(5) a nullity. Such a reading would contort the statute to impose 
liability upon anyone who deals in any way with  [**45] a person who ""lack[s] . . . knowledge, ability, experience, or capacity."""
1401,11," With respect to Plaintiffs' comparison to ProDoc, Defendant's expert, Dr. Burtis, acknowledged that ""ProDoc has the lowest 
filing and service price among all Texas Online EFSPs"" but also noted that Plaintiffs had omitted certain fees from their 
comparison. (Doc. No. 152-2 at 17.)"
1401,12," Defendant has cited a second expert report, that of Dr. Lauren J. Stiroh, but because she bases her price-related conclusions 
on 2013 data, the Court places less weight on her conclusions. (Doc. No. 145 at 66.) "
1402,13," Plaintiffs make some reference to the fact that, as the sole provider of e-filing and e-serving, Defendant could have charged 
whatever it wanted. Even if that were true, all that it would should would be that Defendant could have acted unconscionably. 
Not only do Defendant's middle-of-the-pack prices refute that charge, the fact that Defendant charged the same prices in other 
locales, where it did face competition, makes even clearer that LexisNexis did not take advantage of its status as sole provider. "
1403,14," Beyond the mere fact that Plaintiffs had to pay the filing fee, which, on its own, does not violate the open courts provision, 
Plaintiffs have articulated no way at all in which the filing fees in the relevant counties interfered with their ability to access the 
courts. Thus, to the extent that the balancing test articulated in LeCroy  [**53] suggests that a plaintiff may be able to state an 
open courts claim even without demonstrating that he has been prevented altogether or delayed in filing — for instance, a 
plaintiff who was not delayed in filing a lawsuit, but who had to forego eating for a weekend due to exorbitant filing fees might 
have a viable suit — Plaintiffs' claims nevertheless fail."
1403,15," And, while the Court need not get this far, Plaintiffs have another problem: as explained in the Court's discussion of the 
unconscionability claim, Plaintiffs really have not shown that Defendant's fees were excessive, and so their whole theory of 
liability on the constitutional claims is quite dubious. "
1405,1," The Court's previous orders provide a full discussion of the facts related to this case. See, e.g., Reg'l Multiple Listing Serv. of 
Minn., Inc. v. Am. Home Realty Network, Inc., 960 F. Supp. 2d 958, 2013 WL 3367132 (D. Minn. 2013); Reg'l Multiple Listing 
Serv. of Minn., Inc. v. Am. Home Realty Network, Inc., Civ. No. 12-965, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 138690, 2012 WL 4470286 (D. 
Minn. Sept. 27, 2012). The Court will recite here only those facts relevant to this motion."
1405,2," RMLS alleges that AHRN willfully infringed RMLS's copyrighted material by displaying the material on NeighborCity. On 
September 27, 2012, the Court entered a preliminary injunction against AHRN. Reg'l Multiple Listing Serv. of Minn. v. Am. Home 
Realty Network, Inc., Civ. No. 12-965, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 138690, 2012 WL 4470286, at *11 (D. Minn. Sept. 27, 2012), 
amended by 960 F. Supp. 2d 958, 2013 WL 3367132 (D. Minn. 2013), modified by 960 F. Supp. 2d 988, 2013 WL 6481201 (D. "
1406,," Minn. 2013), 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4647, 2014 WL 67952 (D. Minn. Jan. 8, 2014). The proceedings regarding RMLS's direct 
claims against AHRN are not relevant to the counterclaim issues addressed in this Order. "
1409,3," As the Court will explain below, the allegations against Edina Realty also suffice to state a claim against its parent company, 
HomeServices, because AHRN alleges that HomeServices took direct action to participate in the anti-competitive conspiracy by 
sending a letter to AHRN on Edina Realty's behalf. See infra Part II.C. "
1411,4," Because the Court concluded that rule of reason analysis supported the unreasonable restraint of trade element in the 
alternative to group boycott as a per se restraint, see RMLS I, 960 F. Supp. 2d 958, 2013 WL 3367132 at *17, the Court would 
not be required to dismiss AHRN's claims against the Counterclaim Defendants even if the group boycott theory were to fail. The 
Court will not rely on this alternative ground, however, because it finds that AHRN has adequately stated a Sherman Act § 1 
claim based on group boycott against the Counterclaim Defendants such that it should be permitted to advance the theory at 
later stages of litigation."
1411,5," The group boycott issue centers on Edina Realty rather than HomeServices or their collective action, but, as the Court will 
explain in Part III.C, AHRN sufficiently states this claim against HomeServices as Edina Realty's parent company. "
1413,6," The Court properly considers the letter itself at this stage because it is a document ""necessarily embraced by the complaint,"" 
because its contents are alleged in the complaint and neither party questions its authenticity. Ashanti v. City of Golden Valley, 
666 F.3d 1148, 1151 (8th Cir. 2012). The Court does not, however, consider the additional email chain referenced by 
 [**34] AHRN in its Memorandum in Opposition to the Motion to Dismiss, (see Mem. in Opp. to Mot. to Dismiss at 10-11, Aug. 
21, 2013, Docket No. 164; Snyder Decl., Ex. 2) as neither the existence of those emails, nor their content, are alleged in the 
counterclaims. "
1423,1," The facts that follow are taken from Plaintiff's FAC, which, for purposes of this motion, the Court accepts as true. "
1425,2," The FAC includes a discussion of investigations conducted by the International Trade Commission (""ITC"") and Department of 
Commerce regarding Defendants' trade practices and conduct, as well as the resulting injury to United States manufacturers, 
including Solyndra. FAC ¶¶ 124-151. In its motion to dismiss, Defendants dispute the relevance of this information, and argue

Mot. at 3. A court considering a motion to dismiss may take notice of matters of public record, and materials necessarily relied "
1426,," upon in the pleadings where authenticity is not contested. Lee v. City of Los Angeles, 250 F.3d 668, 669 (9th Cir. 2001). 
However, for purposes of the instant motion, consideration of the ITC and Department of Commerce's findings is unnecessary to 
determine whether Plaintiff's claims survive Defendants' motion to dismiss. "
1427,3," The Sherman Act, § 1, prohibits agreements that unreasonably restrain competition, while § 2 prohibits monopolization, 
attempted monopolization, and conspiracies to monopolize."

Shell Chem. Co., 845 F.2d 802, 811 (9th Cir. 1988). ""Restraints imposed by agreement between competitors have traditionally

1428,5," Defendants also posit that Plaintiff's claims of conspiratorial conduct are ""implausible"" given the ""large number of players 
alleged to have been involved."" Defs.' Mot. at 8. Plaintiff has identified seven co-conspirators in addition to named Defendants. 
Defendants cite no authority for the proposition that this particular number of coconspirators renders [**20]  the alleged 
conspiracy untenable, as a matter of law. In any event, given the limited record presented, this issue is not one suitable for 
resolution at this stage of the litigation."
1428,6," Though the pleadings utilize the term ""predatory"" in relation to Defendants' intentional pricing strategy, Plaintiff styles its 
Sherman Act claim as one for price-fixing, and not strictly for predatory pricing. FAC ¶¶ 218-227. "
1429,7," ""Certain agreements, such as horizontal price fixing and market allocation, are thought so inherently anticompetitive that each 
is illegal per se without inquiry into the harm it has actually caused."" Copperweld, 467 U.S. at 780. Such activity ""deprives the 
marketplace of the independent centers of decisionmaking that competition assumes and demands"" and ""not only reduces the 
diverse directions in which economic power is aimed but suddenly increases the economic power moving in one particular 
direction."" Id. at 769. Though the combination of resources ""may well lead to efficiencies that benefit consumers, . . . their 
anticompetitive potential is sufficient to warrant scrutiny even in the absence of incipient monopoly."" Id. "
1430,8," In their reply, Defendants posit that 65% control of the solar panel market is insufficient to confer the requisite market power to

resolution on a pleading motion."

to ""drive [a competitor] out of the relevant markets"" could be shown by ""(i) pricing below the level necessary to sell their 
products, or (ii) pricing below some appropriate measure of cost."" Id. "
1433,10," HN21[

effect is a tendency or capacity to mislead or deceive purchasers or prospective purchasers; or [¶] (c) Where the effect is to 
divert trade from or otherwise injure competitors."" "
1437,1," Given the dismissal of all federal claims brought by Plaintiff, Plaintiff's state law tortious interference with business relationships 
claim (Count IV of the Complaint) is DISMISSED for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. "
1438,2," Plaintiff has brought no breach of contract claim against Delta in this case and expressly disavows such a claim. (MTD Opp'n at 
1; Tr. 32:5-19.) Delta likewise asserts that it has no contract with Plaintiff. (MTD Mem. at 3.)"
1438,3, Neither Plaintiff nor Defendants claim that Delta or IBC ever obtained the OPP project after Plaintiff's removal. 
1439,4," Plaintiff contends that it is inappropriate to determine which of these analytical frameworks applies to its allegations on a motion 
to dismiss. (MTD Opp'n at 17, 24.) The method of analysis selected in this case, however, is inconsequential, as Plaintiff has not 
sufficiently alleged a restraint of trade under any of these frameworks."
1439,5," A conspiracy alleged to target only one product of one manufacturer's brand merits Rule of Reason review and is not an 
appropriate basis for per se or quick-look analysis. Elecs. Commc'ns Corp. v. Toshiba Am. Consumer Prods., Inc., 129 F.3d 240, 
244 (2d Cir. 1997) (""Because one manufacturer's product was involved . . . the agreement was not per se illegal and rule of 
reason analysis applied.""); Integrated Sys., 713 F. Supp. 2d at 297 (""A conspiracy to eliminate competition with respect to one 
component . . . , within one brand, within an industry in which Plaintiff has not alleged a lack of substitutes is not the type of

output,' nor is it a restraint with which 'courts have had considerable experience' such that a per se rule would be appropriate.""); 
id. (rejecting conspiracy targeting single brand as the type of ""naked restraint"" that would warrant a quick-look analysis). "
1441,6," Todd, 275 F.3d at 200 (collecting cases) (""Cases in which dismissal on the pleadings is appropriate frequently involve either (1) 
failed attempts to limit a product market to a single brand, franchise, institution, or comparable entity that competes with potential 
substitutes or (2) failure even to attempt a plausible explanation as to why a market should be limited in a particular way.""); 
Mathias, 152 F. Supp. 2d at 483 (dismissing Sherman Act claims because, in part, plaintiff's ""proffered product market is 
artificially based on a single brand name product"")."
1441,7," Spectrofuge Corp. v. Beckman Instruments, Inc., 575 F.2d 256, 282 (5th Cir. 1978) (""[S]uch a limited market would be 
appropriate when, for example,  [*19] . . . a firm's product has total market dominance as opposed to mere 'brand' monopoly; 
that is, if the firm's product is so unique or so dominant in the market in which it competes that any action by the manufacturer to 
increase his control over that product virtually assures that competition in the market will be destroyed."")."
1441,8," Plaintiff's allegations actually indicate just the opposite, stating that Delta manufactures one of a number of brands of BACnet 
products, which are a subset of a larger assortment of BMS products, all of which are potential substitutes for one another. (See 
Compl. ¶¶ 31, 40, 42, 54, 57, 65.)"
1441,9," The law has long been clear that a single purchaser's preferences cannot define a product market. See NYNEX Corp., 86 F. 
Supp. 2d at 160-61 (citing TV Commc'ns Network, Inc. v. Turner Network Television, Inc., 964 F.2d 1022, 1025 (10th Cir.) 
(finding no Sherman Act violation where alleged product market monopolized by TNT consisted only of the TNT channel, 
because a company is permitted to hold a natural monopoly over its own product); Int'l Logistics Grp., Ltd. v. Chrysler Corp., 884 
F.2d 904, 908-09 (6th Cir. 1989) (seller's loss of contracts with a single government purchaser is not cognizable under the 
Sherman Act); Disenos Artisticos E Industriales, S.A. v. Work, 714 F. Supp. 46, 47-48 (E.D.N.Y. 1989) (generally, a single 
product market cannot be its own relevant market))."
1441,10," Group Health, 649 F.3d at 156 (affirming dismissal of federal and state antitrust claims on the ground that the alleged relevant 
market was ""legally insufficient because it is defined by [a single purchaser's] preferences, not according to the rule of 
reasonable interchangeability and cross-elasticity of demand""); du Pont, 351 U.S. at 392-93 (""A retail seller may have in one 
sense a monopoly  [*21] on certain trade because . . . no one else makes a product of just the quality or attractiveness of his 
product."" However, this sort of market dominance ""is not the power that makes an illegal monopoly.""). "
1442,11," Market power is the power to control prices in, or exclude competition from, a particular market. Geneva Pharms. Tech. Corp. 
v. Barr Labs. Inc., 386 F.3d 485, 500 (2d Cir. 2004)."
1442,12," Assuming, arguendo, that the conduct alleged by Plaintiff is anticompetitive in nature, the significance of Defendants' market 
share is demonstrated by the fact that the analysis of whether Defendants' alleged conduct has anticompetitive effect would 
differ based on Defendants' market share. For example, if Defendants forced VARs off of projects in favor of IBC when Delta had 
power over 99% of the BACnet products market, this would likely give rise to an inference of monopolistic harm to the market 
essentially controlled by Delta. However, if Defendants engaged in the same conduct when Delta had only 1% market share, 
there is little to no likelihood that a violation of the antitrust laws would be found. Cf. Geneva Pharms., 386 F.3d at 500-501 
(finding that Defendant's ""high market share . . . creates a strong inference of monopoly power""); Tops Mkts., 142 F.3d at 96-97 
 [*24] (finding that the defendant's 72% market share was insufficient, alone, to support a Section One violation). "
1444,13," (Compare Compl. ¶¶ 5(d) (""the customer is left with no competitive choice for an alternative BMS product or a different value 
added reseller""), 54(d) (""it is then too late in the bidding process for the introduction of a different BACnet BMS product into the 
job specifications""), 54(e) (""by this stage,"" customers ""are already committed to the use of Delta specifications . . . and, 
consequently, the customer is unable to switch to a different VAR""), 94-96, 106 (""customers were forced to use IBC for the 
installation, and post0installation period maintenance, of the Delta products it purchased""), 111 (""the purchaser was, in fact, 
compelled to accept IBC as Delta's preferred vendor"") with Tr. 53:7-13 (Plaintiff's counsel stating that ""the Police Plaza 
engineers were so upset with that and did not and chose not to work with IBC for a variety of reasons that they canceled that 
whole spec"") and Tr. 34:4-21 (Plaintiff's counsel stating that IBC did not win the OPP  [*34] project bid ""because the Police Plaza 
engineers . . . rewrote the specs and did a whole different job and used totally different software""); see also Tr. 20:13-18 (IBC 
counsel stating IBC did not get OPP project); MTD Mem. at 18 n.36, 20.) "
1446,14," Although leave to amend is denied to Plaintiff on other grounds, this Court expressly rejects Defendants' argument that a ""pre-
filing exchange"" between the parties should preclude approval of Plaintiff's amendment request. (MTD at 33; Decl. of Michael 
Lindsay ¶¶ 4-6 .) Plaintiff is under no obligation to fashion its Complaint in the manner that Defendants see fit. Such a principle 
or policy would unduly impinge on a plaintiff's prerogative to assert its claims according to its own objectives and strategy, 
whether or not such strategy is ultimately successful. "
1448,1," MIS is a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (""NRSRO"") regulated by the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC). (Am. Compl. ¶ C.ii)."
1448,2," It is unclear from the complaint whether, at the time of imposition of this new policy, plaintiff was employed as a research writer 
or an assistant vice president (or both), and therefore unclear whether plaintiff was allowed to vote in committees. "
1450,3," The expected-performance standards for the area of productivity state that a research writer is to ""[p]rovide timely edits and 
drafts as requested by Analysts. Turnaround time for short reports (several pages)/comments should be within 24 hours or less. 
Turnaround time for longer reports should be within 48 hours."" (Id.)."
1450,4," The expected-performance standards for the area of ""quality of work"" state that ""[a]ll edited reports forwarded for review are at 
a near publishing quality (i.e. they have clear opinions upfront, being well supported, [*12]  have good structure, being concise 
and free of any typos or formatting issues)."" (Id.)."
1450,5," The expected-performance standards for the area of ""teamwork/commitment"" are described as ""[b]eing supportive of other 
team members and accountable to own responsibility in publishing high quality research products."" (Id.). "
1453,6," Section 929P(b), entitled ""Extraterritorial [*22]  Jurisdiction of the Antifraud Provisions of the Federal Securities Laws"", states, 
in pertinent part, ""The district courts of the United States and the United States courts of any Territory shall have jurisdiction of 
an action or proceeding brought or instituted by the Commission or the United States alleging a violation of the antifraud 
provisions of this title involving . . . (2) conduct occurring outside the United States that has a foreseeable substantial effect 
within the United States."" Id. "
1454,7," See also n.6, supra"
1454,8," On that note, plaintiff's argument that he is entitled to tolling of the SOX statute of limitations because of defendants' alleged 
""concealment"" is unavailing. (See Pl.'s Opp'n 11). The SOX statute of limitations cannot be tolled back to a time predating the 
protected activity engaged in by a plaintiff. Again, any alleged retaliatory conducted by defendants occurring before May 15, 
2012, when plaintiff reported to the internal hotline, is not cognizable under SOX or Dodd-Frank. "
1455,9," Because these claims are barred by their extraterritorial nature, we need not address defendants' argument that the complaint 
fails in other respects to plead cognizable claims under the cited statutes."
1455,10," Defendants do state, in a footnote, that there is no conflict between Hong Kong and New York law relating to at-will contracts 
(Defs.' Mem. 26 n.20), but this falls short of advocating the use of New York law for all of plaintiff's common-law claims. "
1456,11," Plaintiff mistakenly asserts in his amended complaint that we are hearing this case under both federal question and diversity 
jurisdiction (see Am. Compl. ¶ II.A), but complete diversity is at least open to question as defendants are corporations 
headquartered in New York and plaintiff affirms that he was a resident of New York before moving to Hong Kong, owns a home 
in New York, and intends to return there. (Id. at ¶ II.C.i.). Diversity hinges on where each party is domiciled, and that inquiry 
looks at (1) the party's physical presence in the state; and (2) the intent to remain in that state indefinitely. See, e.g., Mississippi 
Band of Choctaw Indians v. Holyfield, 490 U.S. 30, 48, 109 S. Ct. 1597, 104 L. Ed. 2d 29 (1989). The second element does not 
require that the person have an affirmative intent to remain permanently in the state, merely that he has no present intent to 
move to another state. Nat'l Artists Mgmt. Co., Inc. v. Weaving, 769 F. Supp. 1224, 1227 (S.D.N.Y. 1991). ""One can reside in 
one place but be domiciled in another."" Mississippi Band, 490 U.S. at 48 (quoting District of Columbia v. Murphy, 314 U.S. 441, 
62 S. Ct. 303, 86 L. Ed. 329 (1941)). "
1458,12," It should be noted that plaintiff has sufficiently pleaded publication. Under New York law, a statement is published as soon as 
it is read by anyone else, and ""this rule applies even to statements made by one employee to another."" Albert, 239 F.3d at 269. 
Plaintiff alleges that the PIPs were posted to his shared calendar (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 73, 81), that this calendar was shared with 
colleagues stationed all over the world (id. at ¶ 73 & n.27), and that ""the news"" of the PIPs ""spread"" to a London colleague 
named Hall. (Id. at ¶ 83). Making all inferences in favor of plaintiff, this is sufficient to plead publication. See Pirre v. Printing 
Developments, Inc., 468 F. Supp. 1028, 1041 (S.D.N.Y. 1979) aff'd, 614 F.2d 1290 (2d Cir. 1979) (citing Kennedy v. Butler, Inc., 
245 N.Y. 204, 156 N.E. 666 (1927)); Loughry v. Lincoln First Bank, N.A., 67 N.Y.2d 369, 377, 494 N.E.2d 70, 502 N.Y.S. 2d 965, 
969 (1986). "
1459,13," Plaintiff's alternative argument, that we can exercise supplemental jurisdiction over his false-light claim because the tort of 
false light ""is cognizable in at least some of the other six national jurisdictions in Asia Pacific and Europe where colleagues 
would have . . . received the defamatory PIPs"", is plainly meritless. (Pl.'s Opp'n 13). "
1461,14," To state a claim under the ADA, plaintiff would have had to, at the very least, allege that the standing desk was an 
accommodation necessary for him to perform the essential functions of his job. See, e.g., McMillan v. City of New York, 711 F.3d 
120, 125-26 (2d Cir. 2013). He has not claimed that this is the case, only that the denial evidences age discrimination against 
him. "
1462,15," Indeed, because Ms. Noyce was employed in Sydney, it is not plausible that the decision regarding the standing desk was 
comparably similar for both employees -- that is, involving the same supervisors or criteria for providing the desk -- and plaintiff 
does not so allege."
1462,16," It appears that [*51]  plaintiff was allowed to vote in ratings committee meetings once he was promoted to an assistant vice 
president. (See Am. Compl. ¶ 98). See n.2, supra. "
1463,17," That plaintiff meant to state a claim under the NYSHRL is supported by his assertion in his opposition brief that the NYSHRL 
statute of limitations applies to his claims. (Pl.'s Opp'n 16)."
1463,18," Even if we were to apply the NYSHRL to plaintiff's claim, age discrimination suits brought under NYSHRL are subject to the 
same burden-shifting analysis, and are analyzed using the same standard, as claims brought under the ADEA. See Tomassi v. 
Insignia Financial Group, Inc., 478 F.3d 111, 115 (2d Cir. 2007) (citing Abdu-Brisson v. Delta Airlines, Inc., 239 F.3d 456, 466 
(2d Cir. 2001)); Delville v. Firmenich Inc., 920 F. Supp.2d 446, 458 (S.D.N.Y. 2013). Since plaintiff's pleading of an ADEA 
discrimination claim fails as a matter of law, so too would his claim for age discrimination under NYSHRL. "
1464,19," Indeed, defendants in their memorandum of law state that they were notified by the EEOC of plaintiff's charge on June 28, 
2012. (Defs.' Mem. 20 n.12). "
1466,20," Again, we assume that plaintiff also meant to bring a retaliation claim under NYSHRL § 296. As with his discrimination claim, 
because he is not a New York resident and has failed to plead that there is anything more than a tangential connection between 
the alleged [*65]  retaliatory conduct and the State of New York, he cannot utilize the NYSHRL. See pp. 55-57, supra."
1466,21," In his opposition, plaintiff makes the argument that the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act can be applied to his claim, ostensibly 
extending the statute of limitations of ADEA back in time to cover his myriad allegations. (Pl.'s Opp'n 15-16). He also seems to 
argue that the statute of limitations should be tolled due to concealment of plaintiff's rights by defendants. (Id. at 17). Putting to 
one side the merits of these arguments, we note again that the only adverse employment actions that plaintiff has sufficiently 
pled are his suspension and termination. Therefore, even if we were to extend the statute of limitations all the way back to 
February 2008, when he was hired, that would not save his insufficiently-pled allegations of poor treatment by defendants. "
1467,22," Plaintiff also seems to imply that Moody's informed him that his supervisor was to be Gary Lau, but subsequently switched him 
to [*68]  Cahill soon after he started work, redrafting and backdating a new offer letter that included Cahill's name. (Id. at ¶ 128 
n.40). "
1468,23," In any event, there is no significant conflict between the laws of the two jurisdictions. Laws. Under Hong Kong law, either party 
to a contract of employment may at any time terminate the contract without notice by agreeing to remit to the other party one 
month's pay. See Hong Kong Ordinances Cap 57 § 7(1A). This is substantially similar to the law in [*71]  New York -- discussed 
in greater detail below -- which makes an employment agreement terminable at will unless otherwise specified. See Reid v. 
Ernst & Young Global Ltd., 13 Misc. 3d 1242[A], 831 N.Y.S.2d 362, 2006 NY Slip Op 52298[U], 2006 WL 3455359, at *4 
(Sup. Ct. N.Y. Cty. 2006) (""[T]he court discerns no actual conflict between Hong Kong law and New York law as they apply to a 
claim for breach of contract.""). Where there is no conflict between the laws of two jurisdictions, no choice-of-law problem arises, 
and we would therefore apply New York law in any event. See, e.g., Employers Ins. Of Wausau v. Duplan Corp., 899 F. Supp. 
1112, 1118 (S.D.N.Y. 1995)."
1468,24," We refer to the terms of the contract, which defendants proffer, since it is referred to by plaintiff in his complaint and is integral 
to his contract claims. "
1469,25," The Second Circuit has enumerated one exception: an at-will employee can recover for a breach of the covenant of good faith 
and fair dealing if the employee could demonstrate that his employment was terminated so that the employer could avoid paying 
him earned commissions on completed sales. Wakefield v. N. Telecom, Inc., 769 F.2d 109, 114 (2d Cir. 1985). Plaintiff does not 
allege that this occurred, nor would this be at [*77]  all applicable to the facts of this case."
1469,26," As an aside, plaintiff's breach-of-good-faith claim would also fail under Hong Kong law, as ""there is no general principle of 
'good faith and fair dealing' in contract law in the performance of a contract."" Dawn Jade Ltd. v. Himanshu Girdhar Dua, HKEC 
1957 (2013). "
1478,1," Enhanced Oil Recovery involves the injection of CO2 into existing oil fields for the purpose of re-pressurizing them. Re-
pressurization allows for the recovery of additional oil from the fields. "
1480,2," Plaintiffs argue that while antitrust injury is typically limited to consumers and competitors, courts have recognized antitrust 
standing in other contexts. See Mem. in Supp. of Resp., 9 (citing Blue Shield of Va. v. McReady, 457 U.S. 465, 102 S. Ct. 2540, 
73 L. Ed. 2d 149 (1982)). This argument is misplaced, because the United States Supreme Court later explained that McReady 
had standing to maintain a federal antitrust action because she was a down-steam consumer of services in the market that was 
allegedly being restrained. See Associated Gen. Contractors, 459 U.S. at 519, 538. See also Norris v. Hearst Trust, 500 F.3d 
454, 467 (5th Cir. 2007)(discussing McReady in light of the subsequent Associated Gen. Contractors decision). "
1486,1," The Williamsons note that, in resolving their motion for leave to serve additional discovery requests, the Magistrate Judge 
incorrectly stated that the ""Williamsons contend that the information sought through these requests is critical to their Lanham Act 
claim."" (Doc. 209 in Case No. 2:09-cv-172). Because the Williamsons did not file a Lanham Act claim, the order should have "
1487,," referred instead to Craig Williamson's defamation claims. This scriveners error is inconsequential, however, because, for the 
reasons stated below, the Williamsons fail to demonstrate that the conclusion reached by the Magistrate Judge, on the issue of 
Williamsons' request for leave to serve additional discovery requests on Taylor, is clearly erroneous or contrary to law. "
1494,2," Plaintiff Williamson does not challenge Defendant St. Martin's argument that he has not presented evidence demonstrating that 
she intentionally procured the breach of an existing contract. Therefore, insofar as Plaintiff Williamson originally made such a 
claim, the Court views the claim as abandoned. See, e.g., Clark v. City of Dublin, 178 F. App'x 522, 524-25 (6th Cir. 2006) 
(affirming trial court's finding that the plaintiff's failure to properly respond to the arguments raised in a motion for summary 
judgment constituted an abandonment of those claims). "
1503,1," This motion has been adopted by Defendants Highway 90, LLC, River Birch, Inc., and Albert J. Ward, Jr. See Rec. Docs. 70, 
74, and 76. "
1505,2," See RICO Case Statement (Rec. Doc. 5, p. 16); see also Amended Complaint (Rec. Doc. 10), ¶¶34, 36-49."
1505,3," Plaintiff identifies bribes paid to Henry Mouton as the predicate acts of his RICO claims concerning the Chef Menteur landfill in 
both his amended complaint and RICO case statement. See Amended Complaint (Rec.  [*11] Doc. 10), ¶ 91; RICO Case 
Statement (Rec. Doc. 5), pp. 8-11."
1505,4," In its opposition memorandum, Plaintiff argues that ""Mayor Nagin's revocation of Chef Menteur's emergency authorization 'was 
a foreseeable and natural consequence of [Defendants'] scheme,' and, indeed, was the very purpose of putting Mouton on their 
illicit payroll of secret 'lobbyists.'"" See Rec. Doc. 89, pp. 16-17. The pertinent inquiry, however, is the direct relationship between 
the defendant's unlawful conduct and the harm, not merely that the harm is foreseeable. See Hemi Group, 559 U.S. at 12."
1505,5," See Amended Complaint (Rec. Doc. 10), at ¶ 41."
1505,6," See Amended Complaint (Rec. Doc. 10), at ¶¶ 43-44."
1505,7, Id.
1505,8," In its opposition memorandum, Plaintiff additionally contends that ""new revelations suggest that Defendants may have 
committed additional predicate acts in their efforts to influence Mayor Nagin's decision""; specifically, giving ""Mayor Nagin 
$20,000 in improper campaign contributions—funneled through shell companies that would avoid detection—shortly before his 
sudden and unexpected reversal on Chef Menteur's authorization."" See Rec. Doc. 89, p. 4 n. 4, and p.13 n.7. This allegation is 
inconsistent  [*13] with the predicate act (Mouton bribery) and ""governmental and public opposition"" theory outlined in Plaintiff's "
1506,," amended complaint and RICO statement. More importantly, however, factual assertions found in a plaintiff's memorandum, 
rather than his complaint, are insufficient to overcome a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss."

1510,2," At the conclusion of the opinion, the Astoria Court stated: Whereas the right to petition granted by the First Amendment is not absolute, we find no reason to give the defendants' 
illegal actions First Amendment  [*9] constitutional protection. In our view, while the [United States] Supreme Court has 
chosen to cast a wide net of protection afforded by Noerr-Pennington, this net should not be expanded to protect illegal 
activity, especially in claims that arise outside of the scope of antitrust laws. And, although the dicta from Omni may indicate the [United States Supreme] Court's reluctance to carve out additional 
exceptions to Noerr-Pennington, this language is far from a clear mandate that the defendants' corrupt actions must be 
afforded civil immunity under the doctrine. Considering the extent of criminality alleged to be involved in this case, we do 
not believe that the United States Supreme Court would be inclined to find that Noerr-Pennington provides civil immunity to 
the defendants. We find that the alleged bribery and corruption in this case are not petitioning activities that should be 
constitutionally protected. To hold otherwise would give Noerr-Pennington a sweeping effect far beyond the original 
purpose of the doctrine. Astoria, 12 So.3d at 967 (emphasis added)."

to final decisions of the Louisiana Supreme Court. Decisions of Louisiana's intermediate courts are not disregarded ""unless we 
are convinced the Louisiana Supreme Court would decide otherwise [but] we are not strictly bound by them.""). "
1514,1," Since the Court will transfer the case to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, the Court declines to 
address Defendant's alternative argument that, although venue is proper in New Jersey, the case should be transferred to the 
Northern District of Illinois for the convenience of the parties pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a). Similarly, in light of the Court's 
decision to transfer, the Court declines to address the merits of Defendant's Motion to Dismiss for failure to state a claim."

1515,3," Defendant contends that AAPS's allegation that the Joint Commission requires physicians at its accredited facilities to 
participate in the MOC program is conclusory. In support of its contention, Defendant relies on Plaintiff's allegation that ""[t]o 
comply with [t]he Joint Commission's requirements, many hospitals impose parts or all of Defendant's ABMS MOC® program[.]"" 
(Def.'s Br. at 8 n.2 (quoting Compl. at ¶ 15)) (emphasis [*8]  added). In the view of the Defendant, it follows from Plaintiff's 
allegation that ""not all hospitals require physicians who seek medical staff privileges to comply with parts or all of the MOC 
program."" (Def.'s Br. at 8). "
1518,4," If the exclusion of J.E. from the Somerset Medical Center was a such ""a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise"" 
to Plaintiff's claims, one would assume that both J.E. and the SMC would have been named as parties to this action. The fact 
that they were not further supports the Court's finding that the exclusion of J.E. was only tangentially related to the claims 
against ABMS. "
1539,1," The Direct Purchasers' objections fail to adhere to the level of decorum expected of members of the Bar. See HN1[
] L.R. M.D. Fla. 2.04(h) (""Attorneys and litigants should conduct themselves with civility and in a spirit of cooperation . . . .""). Apparently 
mistakenly believing that sharply worded criticism of the Magistrate Judge's analysis would make their objections more 
persuasive, Direct Purchasers resort to unwarranted, unfair and stinging criticism of her Report and Recommendation. They 
contend she was ""misled"" as to relevant legal standards,that her Report  [*14] and Recommendation was rendered without ""any 
reference to the voluminous underlying record"" and accuse her of having failed to conduct a rigorous analysis of the issues 
(""She conducted no analysis, much less a 'rigorous analysis,' in determining that the alleged conflict may exist."") (Dkt. 486 at 
11); (""The magistrate judge's conclusion as to every claimed flaw is based on no evidence, a superficial misreading of the 
evidence, or highly misleading evidence proffered by Defendants and their expert."") (Dkt. 486 at 15). Direct Purchasers also 
condemn Dr. Leonard's ""highly misleading testimony,"" which allegedly ""colored the magistrate judge's view of the case"" and led 
to her ""blind acceptance"" of his testimony. It is disrespectful and unbecoming of a lawyer to resort to such language, particularly when directed toward a judicial officer. Its 
use connotes arrogance, and reflects an unprofessional, if not immature litigation strategy of casting angry aspersions rather 
than addressing the merits and challenging the recommendations in a dignified and respectful manner. To the extent counsel 
may perceive that they are not accountable for their unprofessional rhetoric, they are mistaken. Further  [*15] commentary of this 
nature demonstrating a lack of respect due to officers and members of the Court will result in the imposition of sanctions."
1539,2," On March 3, 2010, the Federal Trade Commission's released a proposed complaint and consent decree related to its 
investigation of Transitions' alleged anticompetitive behavior. In April 2010, Transitions and the FTC signed a consent decree 
barring Transitions from certain trade practices, including the requirement that its customers enter into exclusivity agreements 
promising not to sell photochromic lenses made by competing manufacturers. In the wake of the consent decree, numerous "
1540,," direct purchasers, indirect purchasers, and competitors filed antitrust actions against Defendants in federal courts across the 
country. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation centralized the cases in this Court."
1540,3," For a detailed description of the distribution channels for photochromic lenses and the different entities involved in the 
distribution process, see the transcript of the hearing on the motion for class certification before the Magistrate Judge (Dkt. 444 
at 26-31). See also Dkt. 421 ¶¶ 11-15, 17, 19."
1540,4," Nouveau Vision, Inc., Optical Supply, Inc., and Florida Optical Express, Inc. are independent wholesale laboratories. Central 
Illinois Vision Associates, Ltd. is an optical retailer and eye care practitioner. B&B Eyes, Inc. was formerly an optical retailer and 
eye care practitioner. (Dkt. 421 ¶ 7)."
1540,5," The proposed class modifies slightly the class defined in the operative pleading, Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs' Consolidated 
Amended Complaint (Dkt. 127, T 36, ¶ 127): All persons or entities that purchased Transitions lenses directly from any Defendant or any Essilor-owned Lab at any time 
between March 3, 2006 and the present (the ""Class Period"").  [*19] Excluded from the Class are Defendants and their 
subsidiaries, parents, or affiliates, whether or not named as a Defendant in this Complaint, and government entities."
1540,6," Plaintiffs contend that there are approximately 17 lens casters that purchased directly from Transitions. ""Lens casters sell and 
distribute both photochromic lenses and non-photochromic lenses to wholesale ophthalmic laboratories, which including both 
independent wholesale ophthalmic laboratories ('independent wholesale labs') and lens caster-owned ophthalmic laboratories 
('lens caster-owned labs'), and major retailers that operate their own ophthalmic laboratories ('integrated retailers')."" (Dkt. 421 ¶ 
15). ""Integrated retailers"" include national regional sales channels (i.e., Walmart and  [*20] Costco) (id. ¶ 21)."
1540,7," Plaintiffs contend that there are approximately 1,500 independent wholesale labs that purchased from EOA during the Class 
Period. ""Wholesale ophthalmic laboratories provide a variety of services to prepare and deliver finished ophthalmic lenses and "
1541,," eyeglasses to their customers, including grinding lenses according to prescription, polishing or edging unfinished ophthalmic 
lenses, applying certain lens surface treatments (such as certain anti-scratch and anti-reflective coatings), and fitting finished 
lenses into eyeglass frames"" (Dkt. 421 ¶ 17). ""Wholesale ophthalmic laboratories, including both independent and lens caster-
owned labs, sell ophthalmic lenses, including photochromic lenses, to ophthalmologists, opticians, optometrists . . . and other 
retailers who do not operate their own integrated ophthalmic laboratories"" (id. ¶ 19). Plaintiffs contend that there are over 36,000 integrated retailers and ECPs that purchased directly from Essilor during the Class 
Period. ""ECPs, retailers and integrated retailers sell photochromic lenses to end consumers"" (Dkt. 421 ¶ 23). "
1542,8," Or, in statistical terms, the use of a p-value that is less than or equal to .50. "
1543,9," Arguably, excluding lens casters from the proposed class would eliminate the fundamental conflict the Magistrate found existed 
in the proposed class as defined by Plaintiffs. As will be discussed, however, the Court declines to modify the proposed class, as 
Plaintiffs insisted that the class be certified as defined and  [*28] never proposed modifications to the Magistrate Judge."
1543,10," In Bonner v. City of Prichard, Ala., 661 F.2d 1206, 1207 (11th Cir. 1981), HN5[
] the Eleventh Circuit adopted as binding 
precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down prior to the close of business on September 30, 1981."
1543,11," HN8[
] The requirements of Rule 23(b)(3) are referred to as ""predominance"" and ""superiority."" Babineau, 576 F.3d at 1190. In deciding whether common questions predominate and whether a class action is the superior method of adjudicating a 
controversy, Rule 23 suggests consideration of four ""pertinent,"" but not exclusive, factors: (A) the class members' interests in 
individually controlling the prosecution or defense of separate  [*31] actions; (B) the extent and nature of any litigation 
concerning the controversy already begun by or against class members; (C) the desirability or undesirability of concentrating the 
litigation of the claims in the particular forum; and (D) the likely difficulties in managing a class action. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3)(A)-
(D). "
1544,12," This standard is invoked only to the extent it is necessary to ""examine the parties' claims, defenses and evidence to ensure 
that class certification would comport with Rule 23's standards."" Babineau, 576 F.3d at 1190. The Eleventh Circuit has not 
expressly addressed the proof required in a class certification proceeding. See In re HealthSouth Corp. Secs. Lit., 261 F.R.D. 
616, 624 (N.D. Ala. 2009) (applying preponderance of evidence standard without presuming Circuit would apply same standard)."
1544,13," Similarly, HN11[
] the Eleventh Circuit has counseled that ""[a]lthough the trial court should not determine the merits of the 
plaintiffs'  [*33] claim at the class certification stage, the trial court can and should consider the merits of the case to the degree 
necessary to determine whether the requirements of Rule 23 will be satisfied."" Valley Drug, 350 F.3d at 1188 n. 15. "

1548,15," See, e.g., Bieneman v. City of Chicago, 864 F.2d 463, 465 (7th Cir. 1988) (class certification denied where some putative 
class members derived ""great benefit"" while others allegedly experienced harm); In re Terazosin Hydrochloride Antitrust Litig., 
223 F.R.D. 666, 668 (S.D. Fla. 2004) (denying motion for class certification when plaintiffs ""failed to demonstrate  [*46] — 
through empirical evidence, data, and an identifiable formula — the absence of the proposed class of any class members who 
benefitted from the alleged anti-competitive agreements""); Auto Ventures, Inc. v. Moran, No. 92-426-CIV-KEHOE, 1997 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 7037, 1997 WL 306895, at *5 (S.D. Fla. Apr. 3, 1997). But see Kohen v. Pacific Invest. Mtg. Co., LLC, 571 F.3d 672, 
678 (7th Cir. 2009) (upholding the grant of class certification even where ""some of the class members probably were net 
gainers""). "
1550,16," Prices paid by three lens casters, however, increased when the FTC consent order ended Transitions' exclusivity 
arrangements (Dkt. 453 ¶ 77). This result is not entirely surprising. HN32[
] Courts, scholars, and practitioners of antitrust law have long recognized that exclusive dealing is not necessarily illegal and that in many circumstances, it may provide a significant 
benefit to the buyer, even if it negatively affects other participants in the market, such as consumers and competitors seeking 
entrance. See, e.g., Tampa Elec. Co v. Nashville Coal Co., 365 U.S. 320, 334, 81 S. Ct. 623, 5 L. Ed. 2d 580 (1961) "
1551,," [*57] (noting that an exclusivity, or requirements, contract may ""well be of economic advantage to buyers as well as to sellers"" 
because it will ""assure supply"" and ""give protection against price fluctuations""); ZF Meritor, LLC v. Eaton Corp., 696 F.3d 254, 
270 (3d Cir. 2012) (""Exclusive dealing agreements are often entered into for entirely procompetitive reasons, and generally pose 
little threat to competition.""); Menasha Corp. v. News Am. Mktg. In-Store, Inc., 354 F.3d 661, 663 (7th Cir. 2004) (""[C]ompetition 
for the contract is a vital form of rivalry, . . . which the antitrust laws encourage rather than suppress. . . . Why would these 
[buyers] shoot themselves in the feet by signing . . . or favoring . . . exclusive contracts that entrench [the seller] as a monopolist 
that can apply the squeeze? . . . That [buyers] like exclusive deals implies that they serve the interests of [the consumers].""); 
Barry Wright Corp. v. ITT Grinnell Corp., 724 F.2d 227, 238 (1st Cir. 1983) (Breyer, J.) (noting that legitimate business 
justifications can support a limited exclusivity contract, including assurances for the buyer of a stable, favorable price); Constr. 
Aggregate Transp., Inc. v. Fla. Rock Indus., Inc., 710 F.2d 752, 773 (11th Cir. 1983)  [*58] (Exclusive dealing ""does not give rise 
to antitrust liability without proof of actual competitive injury. . . . [S]uch a unilateral exercise of business judgment is free from 
scrutiny in the absence of proof of competitive harm, or other underlying illegal behavior.""); Philippe Aghion & Patrick Bolton, 
Contracts as a Barrier to Entry, 77 Am. Econ. Rev. 388, 388 (1987) (""[I]t is a widespread opinion among antitrust practitioners 
that contracts between buyers and sellers are socially efficient."")."
1551,17," Although the lens casters shown to have benefitted from the alleged anticompetitive exclusive agreements comprise but a 
small number of putative class members, a close reading of Valley Drug, Pickett, and Grimes does not indicate a numerical or 
indicate a quantifiable threshold of class members having conflicting interests before a fundamental conflict arises."
1551,18," Accord Broussard v. Meineke Discount Muffler Shops, Inc., 155 F.3d 331, 338-39 (4th Cir. 1998) (conflicts precluding class 
certification arose where some members of the putative class did not desire the remedy sought by named plaintiffs); Almonor v. 
BankAtlantic Bancorp, Inc., 261 F.R.D. 672, 677 (S.D. Fla. 2009) (a benefit arguably conferred on a named plaintiff due to 
defendant's tortious conduct was not enjoyed by other members of the putative class, creating classes of ""winners and losers"" 
and therefore precluding class certification); Duchardt v. Midland Nat'l Life Ins. Co., 265 F.R.D. 436, 451 (S.D. Iowa 2009) 
(existence of winners and losers in the putative class precludes class certification under  [*60] Rule 23(a)(4)); Allied Orthopedic 
Appliances, Inc. v. Tyco Healthcare Group, L.P., 247 F.R.D. 156, 177-78 (C.D. Cal. 2007) (adequacy of representation 
requirement not satisfied when some class members derived a net economic benefit from conduct alleged to be wrongful)."
1551,19," This argument was raised in passing in a footnote in Direct Purchasers' Reply in support of their motion for class certification 
(Dkt. 443 at 4 n.7). "
1552,20," Richardson was cited for this proposition in Shin v. Cobb Cnty. Bd. of Educ., 248 F.3d 1061, 1064 (11th Cir. 2001)."
1552,21," During the hearing  [*63] on the Motion for Class Certification, Plaintiffs' counsel responded to the Magistrate Judge's question 
about certifying subclasses or classes within a class as follows: There is no dispute as to Your Honor's ability to do that. It is our view that it is by no means necessary in this case. And 
defendants can speak for themselves, but they have taken the view that it would be improper for us to raise that issue at 
this stage because we did not raise it in our opening brief. They can speak more to that, but it is our view that the class as proposed satisfies the Rule 23 standard in its 
entirety and that using subclasses would not only add nothing, it would detract from the case and that it would 
make things unnecessarily complicated; and as I'm going to say, the — the lack of complications, the efficiency, to be 
gained is the key standard behind Rule 23(b)(3), and I will get into that a little bit more. (Dkt. 444 at 10-11) (emphasis added). "
1556,22," Sikes was later abrogated by the United States Supreme Court in Bridge v. Phoenix Bond & Indem. Co., 553 U.S. 639, 128 S. 
Ct. 2131, 170 L. Ed. 2d 1012 (2008), on this very point as it related to mail fraud. See id. at 649 (""[N]o showing of reliance is 
required to establish that a person has violated § 1962(c) by conducting the affairs of an enterprise through a pattern of 
racketeering activity consisting of acts of mail fraud.""). "
1557,23," In this respect, the element of antitrust impact is distinguishable from the element of materiality addressed in Amgen. There, 
the district court certified a securities fraud action brought under Rule 10b-5, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed. Amgen, 133 S.Ct. at 
1193-94. The Supreme Court granted certiorari ""to resolve a conflict among the Courts of Appeals over whether district courts 
must require plaintiffs to prove . . . the element of materiality before certifying a class action under § 10(b) and Rule 10b-5."" Id. at 
1194. Affirming certification of the class, the Supreme Court held that materiality need not be proven at the class certification 
stage for two reasons: First, the question of materiality is ""an objective one,"" Id. at 1195 (quoting TSC Indus., Inc. v. Northway, 
Inc., 426 U.S. 438, 445, 96 S. Ct. 2126, 48 L. Ed. 2d 757 (1976)), and if information is material to one plaintiff, it is material to all 
other plaintiffs, and materiality can therefore be proved ""through evidence common to the class."" Id. Second, ""there is no risk 
whatever that a failure of proof on the common question of materiality will result  [*83] in individual questions predominating."" Id. 
at 1196. Rather, a failure of proof on the question of materiality will result in the termination of the entire litigation on the merits 
""for one and for all,"" rather than the persistence of some, but not all, of the plaintiffs' claims. Id. HN48[
] Antitrust impact, on the other hand, is not an ""objective"" question. Id. at 1195. Rather, the element of antitrust impact 
requires proof of an individualized ""causal relation between the alleged antitrust violation and an injury to plaintiff's business."" 
Fla. Rock, 710 F.2d at 782; see also ZF Meritor, 696 F.3d at 281 (""To establish antitrust injury, the plaintiff must demonstrate . . . 
an injury to the plaintiff which flows from that which makes defendant's acts unlawful.""); Bell Atl., 339 F.3d at 302 (establishing 
antitrust impact ""requires the plaintiff to demonstrate a causal connection between the specific antitrust violation at issue and an 
injury to the . . . antitrust plaintiff"")."
1557,24," HN49[
] While some courts have stated that class certification is not precluded when a proposed class includes members 
who have not been harmed by the defendants' conduct, see, e.g., Kohen, 571 F.3d at 677 (""What is true is that  [*84] a class will 
often include persons who have not been injured by the defendant's conduct . . . . Such a possibility or indeed inevitability does 
not preclude class certification.""); In re Nexium (Esomeprazole) Antitrust Litig.,     F.R.D.    , No. 12-md-02409-WGY, 297 F.R.D. 
168, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 162276, 2013 WL 6019287, at *8 (D. Mass. Nov. 14, 2013) (certifying class despite evidence that 
more than de minimis number of members of putative class suffered no impact), those decisions do not place the same ""utmost 
importance"" on proving impact. Blue Bird, 573 F.2d at 317. And whether the discussion in Kohen is even relevant to a 
predominance inquiry is questionable. In Kohen, the Seventh Circuit was addressing ""statutory standing"" at the inception of a 
case, and whether the court had subject matter jurisdiction based on allegations of harm to some members of the class. 571 
F.3d at 676-77. Even Kohen acknowledged, however, that ""a class should not be certified if it is apparent that it contains a great 
many persons who have suffered no injury at the hands of the defendant."" Id. at 677. "
1558,25," The requirement of proving ""actual competitive injury"" stands in contrast to claims of price-fixing, as alleged in Blue Bird and 
forming the basis for the certified state class there. Price-fixing is per se illegal under antitrust law, and price-fixing plaintiffs 
need not establish injury-in-fact in order to be awarded damages. See United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. 150, 
218, 60 S. Ct. 811, 84 L. Ed. 1129 (1940) (reaffirming that price-fixing agreements are per se unlawful under the Sherman Act)."
1558,26," See, e.g., Bell Atl., 339 F.3d at 302 (HN52[
] ""[W]here fact of damage cannot be established for every class member through proof common to the class, the need to establish antitrust liability for individual class members defeats Rule 23(b)(3) 
predominance."") (emphasis added); Cement & Concrete, 278 F.R.D. at 682 (""Common issues of fact and law predominate if 
they have a direct impact on every class member's effort to establish liability and on every class member's entitlement to 
injunctive relief."") (emphasis added, citations and quotations omitted); Allied Orthopedic, 247 F.R.D. at 165 (""[C]lass certification 
is precluded where plaintiffs have not shown that the fact of injury element  [*87] can be proven for all class members with 
common evidence."") (emphasis added); Weisfeld v. Sun Chemical Corp., 210 F.R.D. 136, 144 (D. N.J. 2002) (""Plaintiff must 
establish that each class member has, in fact, been injured by the alleged conduct."") (emphasis added). See also 2A Phillip E. 
Areeda et al., Antitrust Law: An Analysis of Antitrust Principles and Their Application ¶ 331 (3d ed. 2007) (""The fact that some 
class members may not have been damaged at all generally defeats certification because the fact of injury, or 'impact,' must be 
established by common proof."" ). "
1559,27," The objections do not discuss the lack of data for Group C, commenting only that proof of overcharge to Essilor is sufficient 
because Groups B and C bought directly from Essilor."
1559,28," See In re Graphics Processing Units Antitrust Litig. [GPU], 253 F.R.D. 478, 492 (N.D. Cal. 2008) (""[C]ourts . . . are increasingly 
skeptical of plaintiffs' experts who offer only generalized and theoretical opinions that a particular methodology may serve this 
purpose without also submitting a functioning model that is tailored to market facts in the case at hand."") (quoting Ian Simmons 
et al., Rigorous Analysis in Class Certification Proceedings, ANTITRUST 65, 65 (Summer 2007))."
1559,29," In his merits report (Dkt. 457-2), Dr. Singer sets forth a proposed method of demonstrating antitrust impact on Groups B and 
C. (Dkt. 457-2, ¶¶153-161). This data was provided to Defendants for the first time in Direct Purchasers' Reply in support of the 
motion for class certification, and Defendants  [*91] had no opportunity to respond, making the merits report an improper rebuttal 
report. See Plumley v. Mockett, 836 F. Supp. 2d 1053, 1066 (C.D. Cal. 2010); Baker v. Chevron USA, Inc., 680 F. Supp. 2d 865, 
879 (S.D. Ohio 2010); Procter & Gamble Co. v. McNeil-PPC, Inc., 615 F. Supp. 2d 832, 838 (W.D. Wis. 2009). Even if the merits report is considered, it is based on a faulty assumption which renders its conclusions doubtful. In order to 
construct a regression for Groups B and C, Dr. Singer presumes that the price increases for the lens casters would manifest 
themselves in the form of price increases to members of Group B and Group C. This assumption rests on two faulty premises. 
First, the results from the Group A regression in the merits report consist of an average price increase across all lens casters, 
while the members of Groups B and C are direct purchasers of EOA, only. Dr. Singer never demonstrates that EOA suffered 
impact that can be passed through to the purchasers in Groups B and C. This leads to the second faulty premise, which is that 
EOA, a co-Defendant and alleged co-conspirator of Transitions, suffered antitrust impact. Dr. Singer offers no common proof 
that could be used  [*92] to demonstrate that EOA was impacted. Moreover, Dr. Singer recognized no such possibility of impact 
when he excluded EOA from his individualized impact analysis in his initial certification report. "
1560,30," See, e.g., Blades v. Monsanto Co., 400 F.3d 562, 572-74 (8th Cir. 2005) (individual questions predominated where evidence 
showed that list prices varied depending on the market, and customers often did not pay list prices); Piggly Wiggly, 100 Fed. 
Appx. at 298 (affirming district court's decision that individualized determination would be required because many class 
members negotiated a price rather than accepting list price); GPU, 253 F.R.D. at 490-91 (predominance not satisfied where

1560,32," In his merits report, Dr. Singer concludes that 72% of the price card observations match the transactional data (Dkt. 457-2 at 
89 n.332). A 72% correlation rate does not establish that price card data served as an appropriate benchmark for negotiations 
 [*97] or negotiated prices. Nor does Dr. Singer refer to any other evidence demonstrating such a relationship. Moreover, the 
72% match rate includes what Dr. Singer refers to as ""near matches,"" observations in the price card data that have near 
equivalent observations in the transaction data. Dr. Singer's definition of near equivalent observations is fairly broad, however. A 
near equivalent observation is any data point in the transactional data within one year and with a price difference of up to 5% of 
any data point in the price card data. Dr. Singer does not explain his reasoning for concluding that prices within a 10% range 
over a period of a year ""nearly match."" And the 5% differential in price and one year timeframe are unacceptably broad, 
considering that Dr. Singer's regressions are based on monthly changes in price averaging no more than four-tenths of one 
percent, more than ten times smaller than the difference Dr. Singer allows for a ""match."" In sum, even if Dr. Singer's merits report is considered, Direct Purchasers cannot demonstrate that the price card data used are 
correlative ""benchmarks"" or ""references"" for the actual transactions that occurred. "

1562,35," Direct Purchasers cite Columbus Drywall & Insulation, Inc. v. Masco Corp. as accepting a 50% measure of statistical

30937, 2009 WL 856306, at *10 (N.D. Ga. Feb. 9, 2009). "
1563,36," Because Direct Purchasers are unable to demonstrate that questions of law or fact common to class members predominate 
over individualized questions, it is unnecessary to address whether a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly 
and efficiently adjudicating the controversy. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3). "
1569,1," We recite the relevant facts in the light most favorable to Kolon. In so doing, we have done our best to honor the parties' oft-
overzealous desires to keep certain purportedly sensitive information under seal. However, to the extent the district court has 
already disclosed (without objection) such information, we treat it as public knowledge. "
1571,2," In its motion and supporting memorandum, Kolon also suggested that the district court ""revisit its refusal to recuse"" from the 
trade secrets case, apparently referring to the discussion of recusal in July. Docket No. 247, at 2; Docket No. 248, at 31. Kolon 
filed no separate motion for recusal in the trade secrets case at that time, but did briefly reference recusal in several subsequent 
filings. On December 9, 2011, Kolon filed a reply in support of its motion for a judgment as a matter of law; in  [**13] a footnote, it 
reminded the court of its position that the judge should not have ruled regarding the adverse jury instructions. See Docket No. 
1738, at 13. On December 23, Kolon asked the court to consider recusal in its memorandum supporting its motion to stay the 
injunction proceedings. See Docket No. 1813, at 19. And in its reply regarding that motion, on January 11, Kolon insisted that a 
formal motion for recusal was unnecessary. See Docket No. 1843, at 19 (responding to Docket No. 1830, at 26-27). During a 
January 2012 hearing on Kolon's motion for a new trial and judgment as a matter of law in the trade secrets case, counsel for 
Kolon again requested that the district court judge recuse himself. The judge refused to do so, explaining that he did not have a 
recusal motion before him in that case. Three days later, on January 27, 2012, Kolon filed its motion for recusal and 
disqualification in the trade secrets case. The district court denied the recusal motions in both cases on February 21. "
1572,3," A separate recusal statute, 28 U.S.C. § 144, provides parties with one opportunity per case to file an affidavit that the presiding 
judge has a personal bias or prejudice regarding a party. If the affidavit is sufficient, accompanied by a certificate of good faith, 
and timely filed, another judge will be assigned to the proceeding. Kolon did not seek recusal on this ground in the district court."
1572,4," Additionally, the district court held that recusal was unnecessary under § 455(a). Since Kolon does not appeal that ruling, we 
do not address it."
1572,5," 28 U.S.C. § 455(b)(1) HN3[
] requires a judge to recuse himself ""[w]here he has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a 
party, or personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts concerning [a] proceeding."" "
1573,6," The dissent says that our decision in United States v. Lindsey, 556 F.3d 238 (4th Cir. 2009), cuts against imposing a timeliness 
requirement under § 455(b). With all respect, we do not share that view. In Lindsey, the presiding district court judge had 
participated in defendant Lonnie Robinson's case twelve years earlier as an Assistant United States Attorney. Though the judge 
did not recall his participation in the earlier case, nor was he made aware of it, we vacated his order. But in that case, Robinson 
did not learn of the judge's prior involvement until after filing his appeal. See id. at 246-47. Thus, no timeliness issue ever arose: 
the case is wholly inapposite here. "
1574,7," Section 455's legislative history is murky at best. See Delesdernier v. Porterie, 666 F.2d 116, 119-121 (5th Cir. 1982). When 
Congress revised the statute in 1974, the Justice Department did suggest adding an explicit timeliness requirement like that 
found in § 144. Id. at 120. Congress declined  [**22] to do so, and our friend in dissent believes that decision ""end[s] our inquiry."" 
Dissent at 48. But the Justice Department's suggestion is hardly the only piece of relevant legislative history. Rather, ""prior to the 
1974 amendment[,] courts had generally held that a timely objection under the old § 455 was necessary."" Delesdernier, 666 F.2d 
at 121. ""Thus[,] Congress'[s] failure to act could as easily have been the result of a belief that the judicial gloss on old section 
455 would survive."" Id. (internal quotation marks omitted)."
1574,8," The district judge's May 2009 disclosure of a financial interest does not present an issue under § 455(f), as § 455(b)(4) requires 
recusal only where a financial interest not immediately in controversy ""could be substantially affected by the outcome of the 
proceeding."" "
1575,9," We recognize that Kolon filed its motion to recuse in this case before the district court's issuance of an adverse ruling on 
summary judgment. But its actions here should not be viewed in a vacuum. Recall that Kolon's antitrust claims arose as a 
counterclaim to DuPont's trade secrets action, which proceeded more quickly than the antitrust case, before the same district 
judge. In that case, the judge issued a series of rulings universally adverse to Kolon, and a jury rendered a $920 million verdict 
for DuPont. This had all transpired by the time Kolon filed its recusal motion in the antitrust case. So while Kolon's sandbagging 
may not be obvious in the isolated context of the antitrust case, a global  [**28] view of the relevant events makes clear that 
Kolon held its fire on recusal until after suffering a defeat in the trade secrets case. "
1576,10," In light of our holding, we do not address the district court's alternative ruling that, on the merits, recusal was not required. "
1582,1," The antitrust claims, which are the subject of this appeal, were severed from the trade secrets claims in September 2011."
1582,2," The majority's reference to the absurdity canon is misplaced. There is nothing absurd about my reading of § 455(b)—as 
discussed infra, given the purpose of the statute, it is entirely plausible that Congress did not intend to impose a timely-filing 
requirement. The absurdity canon allows courts to disregard statutory text when adhering to the text ""would result in a 
disposition that no reasonable person could approve."" Antonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of 
Legal Texts 234 (2012). But the canon ""can be a slippery slope. It can lead to judicial revision of public and private texts to make 
them (in the judges' view) more reasonable."" Id. at 237. The hurdle for invoking the canon is thus ""a very high one."" Id. The fact 
that there is a ""plausible reason[]"" for omitting  [**55] a timely-filing requirement in § 455(b) ""forecloses recourse to the absurdity 
canon."" Little v. Shell Exploration & Prod. Co., 690 F.3d 282, 291 (5th Cir. 2012). "
1583,3," The majority compounds its error by requiring not only that recusal be raised in a timely fashion by the parties, but that recusal 
be raised in a formal motion. As noted, § 455(b) includes no procedural requirements. Moreover, the requirement of a motion is 
further undercut by the existence of 28 U.S.C. § 144. That statute provides: Whenever a party to any proceeding in a district court makes and files a timely and sufficient affidavit that the judge before 
whom the matter is pending has a personal bias or prejudice either against him or in favor of any adverse party, such judge 
shall proceed no further therein, but another judge shall be assigned to hear such proceeding. The affidavit shall state the facts and the reasons for the belief that bias or prejudice exists, and shall be filed not less than 
ten days before the beginning of the term at which the proceeding is to be heard, or good cause shall be shown for failure 
to file it within such time. A party may file only one such affidavit in any case. It shall be  [**56] accompanied by a certificate 
of counsel of record stating that it is made in good faith. Section 144, which was in existence at the time Congress amended § 455, clearly illustrates that Congress knew how to require 
a formal filing raising a judge's bias or prejudice and declined to do so in § 455(b)."
1583,4," Prior to the 1974 amendments the statute provided: Any justice or judge of the United States shall disqualify himself in any case in which he has a substantial interest, has been 
of counsel, is or has been a material witness, or is so related to or connected with any party or his attorney as to render it 
improper, in his opinion, for him to sit on the trial, appeal, or other proceeding therein."
1583,28, U.S.C. § 455 (1970 ed.). 
1584,5," To this end, we require parties to file a Corporate Disclosure Statement under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 26.1 so 
that we can generate our own disqualifications; we do not require each party in every appeal to file a motion requesting the 
recusal of certain judges."
1584,6," The majority also relies, in part, on the decisions of our sister circuits imposing a timeliness requirement. Of course, ""agreement 
among courts of appeals on an issue . . . does not invariably garnish Supreme Court approval."" McMellon v. United States, 387 
F.3d 329, 361 (4th Cir. 2004) (en banc) (Motz, J., dissenting). Given the plain language of § 455(b), I find these decisions 
unpersuasive. "
1585,7," This section, like § 455(b) has no specific timeliness requirement. Nonetheless, for purposes of this case, I accept that the 
language is more susceptible to a requirement that the party raise the issue with the judge and that such a requirement is 
mandated by Owens."
1585,8," In fact, Delesdernier specifically reserved the timeliness question under § 455(b). See Delesdernier, 666 F.2d at 123 n.3."
1585,9," The majority misapprehends the importance of Lindsey. According to the majority, Owens mandates a timely-filing requirement 
 [**64] in all § 455 cases. In Lindsey, although the recusal issue was not raised until appeal, there is no discussion about 
timeliness, which is wholly consistent with my view that timeliness is irrelevant to § 455(b) cases because they hinge on the 
mandatory nature of the recusal, not the timely raising of it. If timeliness was as important in all § 455 cases, as the majority 
suggests, surely the issue would have at least been identified in Lindsey. Lindsey's silence on timeliness only reinforces the 
case's thorough discussion of recusal under § 455(b) as a mandatory proposition."
1585,10," My opinion should not be read to suggest that the district judge engaged in actual bias or impartiality in this case. Rather, the 
purpose of § 455(b)(2) is to disqualify judges, even if they have no actual bias in a particular case, because of the great risk of 
the appearance of bias or impartiality in a certain set of cases. That appearance is the issue in this case. "
1586,11," The majority declines to address this issue, yet in the companion case, uses its ""supervisory powers"" under 28 U.S.C. § 2106 
to remand the case for further proceedings before another district judge. See Trade Secrets Case at 15-16. "

experts or in every case."" Kumho Tire, 526 U.S. at 141. "
1591,2," Dr. Murphy challenged Dr. Leamer's analysis, concluding that individualized inquiries predominate over common ones in this 
case for the purpose of determining impact."
1591,3," Edward E. Leamer, Ph.D, is the Chauncey J. Medberry Professor of Management, Professor of Economics,  [*15] and 
Professor of Statistics at the University of California, Los Angeles. Dr. Leamer earned a B.A. in Mathematics from Princeton

coefficients represent the mean change in the dependent variable for one unit of change in the independent variable, holding 
other independent variables in the model constant. "
1593,8," Dr. Leamer further opined that the evidence showed ""a persistent salary structure across employees consistent with important 
elements of equity in the Defendants' compensation practices."" Id. ¶ 134. Dr. Leamer relied on five compensation movement 
charts that depicted changes in the base salaries and total compensation for ten major job titles at Apple between 2006 and 
2009, and the ten major job titles at Google between 2005 and 2009. Id., Figs. 15-17. Dr. Leamer contended that these charts 
offered further evidence that compensation for different positions tended to move together over time (i.e., if software engineers 
received a raise, so did account executives). Id. ¶¶ 133-34. Based on this evidence, Dr. Leamer opined that the anti-solicitation "
1594,," agreements that focused on subsets of workers would nonetheless have broader effects because of a desire on Defendants' 
part to maintain the overall salary structure. Id."
1594,9," In a regression model, an ""interaction"" variable is the product of two other variables that are included in the regression model. 
Ref. Manual at 316. The ""interaction variable essentially allows the expert to take into account the possibility that the effect of a 
change in one variable on the dependent variable may change as the level of another explanatory variable changes."" Id. Here, 
Dr. Leamer ""interacted"" these variables to allow for the possibility that the firms' illegal behavior had different effects on 
employees of different ages, or had different  [*28] effects on employees at firms that had been doing different amounts of hiring 
relative to their total number of employees."
1594,10," Dr. Leamer's general conduct variable is an indicator for when the challenged  [*29] agreements were in effect. Leamer 
Opening ¶¶ 20-21, 44-45. It is a ""zero-one"" variable that is turned ""on"" for a particular defendant during the period when that 
defendant allegedly participated in any of the challenged agreements. Id. It takes on a value of one in the years when a 
defendant had an agreement and zero otherwise. Id. First, the model is run with the conduct variable with a value of one. Id. 
Second, compensation is calculated (the regression is run) with the conduct variable turned off to reflect what compensation 
would have been had there been no non-compete agreements. Id. The difference in compensation between these two runs is 
the estimated reduction in total compensation due to the agreements. Id. The impact of the agreements on wage per year is the 
coefficient on the general conduct variable—i.e., if the coefficient is 0.0559, total compensation was reduced by 5.59% in one 
year. Leamer Reply Rep. ¶ 85. "

1596,15," A Type I error in this case would be a finding of classwide  [*37] impact and damages when there were none. A Type II error

1597,17," Dr. Leamer's alternative model showed that of the five conduct variables' coefficients, two were statistically significant at the 
1% level and three were not significant at the 1%, 5% or 10% levels. Class Cert. Reply Rep. Fig. 14."
1597,18," In Dr. Leamer's May 2013 supplemental expert report, Plaintiffs asked him to respond to questions raised by the Court related 
to whether Dr. Leamer's initial methodology could show classwide impact. Dr. Leamer found that his additional analyses 
confirmed his ""original finding of a somewhat rigid pay structure at each Defendant firm that would have transmitted the effects 
of the agreements broadly, including throughout the Technical Class."" Supp. Class. Cert. Rep. ¶ 13. "
1598,19," Dr. Stiroh makes this precise point when  [*44] stating that in Dr. Leamer's Exhibit 3, the general conduct variable's coefficient 
is not statistically significant. Stiroh Rebuttal ¶ 168. Dr. Leamer highlights this point in the body of his report for the first time in 
his December 2013 reply. Leamer Reply Rep. ¶ 75 (noting that his original conduct regression with clustered standard errors 
""leave[s] the estimated conduct coefficient 'statistically insignificant' at the conventional 5% level[.]"")."
1598,20," Dr. Leamer also used the 1%, 5%, or 10% levels in four of his other charts in his opening merits report. Leamer Opening, Exs. 
2, 4-6 (reporting t-values and noting whether each variable coefficient was statistically significant at the 1%, 5%, or 10% levels)."
1598,21," In Dr. Leamer's reports prior to his October 2013 report, Dr. Leamer also analyzed the statistical significance of many of the 
coefficients in varying models using the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels. See, e.g., Class Cert. Opening Rep. Figs. 20 & 23; Class Cert. 
Reply Rep. Figs. 12, 14, 16-19; Suppl. Class Cert. Rep. ¶¶ 41 (noting ""a t-statistic in excess of 2 in absolute value is said to 
produce 'statistically significant' estimate[s] by conventional [5%] standards.""), Fig. 1 (reporting  [*45] statistical significance at 
the 1%, 5% and 10% levels)."
1598,22," ""Confidence intervals . . . are statistical estimates of the  [*46] range within which there can be reasonable confidence that a 
correlation or prediction is not the result of chance variability in the sample on which the correlation or prediction was based[.]"" 
ATA Airlines, Inc. v. Fed. Exp. Corp., 665 F.3d 882, 895 (7th Cir. 2011). Every confidence interval is the complement of a 
respective significance level. A 95% confidence interval reflects a statistical significance level of 5%. Cook, 580 F. Supp. 2d at 
1101 (""[A] confidence interval can also be used to infer the p-value and thus can be used as a surrogate test for significance. A 
95% confidence interval, for example, that does not include the null hypothesis [] indicates that there is a less than 5% chance 
that the observed association is the result of random error or chance. . . .This is equivalent to a p-value of less than .05, meaning 
the study result is 'statistically significant.' [] Conversely, if the null point falls within the 95% confidence interval, then the study 
result is not deemed 'statistically significant' under a significance level of .05.""). Because a 5% significance level is associated 
with a 95% confidence interval, statisticians sometimes colloquially refer to the 5% level  [*47] as the 95% level. "
1599,23," Nor did Dr. Leamer explain this theory in his November 2013 deposition. When asked by Plaintiffs' counsel to admit that the 
general conduct variable's coefficient in Exhibit 3 of his October 2013 report was ""not statistically significant,"" he simply 
responded, ""That's correct."" Brown Decl, ECF No. 573, Ex. 3, at 1044 (""Nov. 2013 Leamer Dep."")."
1599,24," Plaintiffs' argument that it would be prejudicial not to allow Dr. Leamer to point out the flaws in Dr. Murphy's 5% level, see 
Strike Opp. at 5-6, ignores the point that Dr. Leamer should have included his 50% theory in his opening merits report so that 
Defendants would have a chance  [*49] to respond. Further, while Plaintiffs cite Scientific Components Corp. v. Sirenza 
Microdevices, Inc., No. 03 CV 1851(NGG)(RML), 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 92703, 2008 WL 4911440, at *7 (E.D.N.Y. Nov. 13, 
2008), for the proposition that when ""the alleged confusion in the report in chief turns on a subtle scientific distinction that neither 
side's experts have previously discussed, it is not only permissible but also obligatory for the rebuttal expert report to provide 
technical background information adequate to illustrate the point,"" that case is inapposite because Dr. Murphy did previously 
discuss the same criticism that Dr. Stiroh raises in Dr. Murphy's November 2012 report."
1599,25," Nothing in this Order prevents Dr. Leamer from testifying to one of the opinions set forth in his December 2012 reply, which 
Dr. Leamer expressly incorporated by reference into his December 2013 merits report and attached as an exhibit to his merits 
report, Leamer Opening ¶ 1. In his December 2012 reply, when describing an alternative model that utilized firm-wide 
compensation averages, Dr. Leamer included a one line reference to a 50% significance level (equivalent to a 0.5 p-value), and 
suggested that the conduct variables' coefficients in  [*50] this model may be reliable because they meet the 50% level. See 
Class Cert. Reply Rep. ¶ 107 (""The p-value on all conduct coefficients is less than 0.5 which suggests that it is more likely than 
not that the compensation of employees was decreased during the period of the agreements.""). While Dr. Leamer will not be 
allowed to testify, as laid out in his December 2013 reply, that his original conduct regression model with clustered errors is 
reliable because its general conduct coefficient meets the 50% significance level, Dr. Leamer may testify to the exact opinion 
disclosed in his December 2012 reply, notably that the fact that his alternative conduct regression model's conduct coefficients 
pass the 50% level ""suggests that it is more likely than not that the compensation of employees were decreased during the 
period of the agreements."" Id."
1599,26," Plaintiffs make much of the fact that Dr. Leamer ""does not advocate point null hypothesis testing."" Strike Opp. at 4; Leamer 
Opp. at 8-9 (Dr. Leamer ""has never used point null hypothesis testing in this case.""). Dr. Leamer's testimony on this point has 
been inconsistent. In his December 2013 report and October 2012 deposition, he claimed he had  [*51] not conducted null 
hypothesis testing. Leamer Reply Rep. ¶¶ 77-78, 82; Omnibus Brown Decl., ECF No. 716, Ex. B, ""Oct. 2012 Leamer Dep."" at 
220, 1236-37, 1243-44 (claiming the t-statistics in his exhibits were simply ""standard things that come rolling out of computer 
packages"" and not an indication he did hypothesis testing). Yet in that same deposition, he conceded he did. Oct. 2012 Leamer "
1600,," Dep. at 1239 (""I would admit that [I did hypothesis testing in this case] . . . I'm doing [] the hypothesis testing exercise[.]""); id. at 
1237 (""I pursued . . . the hypothesis testing task.""). In his November 2013 deposition, he stated that the computation of statistical 
significance at the 1%, 5% and 10% levels in his models was ""done setting the null hypothesis to zero"" because ""that's the way 
that it's usually done in econometric literature[.]"" Nov. 2013 Leamer Dep. at 1038-40. Yet he simultaneously claimed that it was 
not his ""choice. That's just a standard operating procedure that economists use. When it comes to estimating damages, I'm 
trying to argue that that is a poor idea."" Id. at 1039. Regardless of whether Dr. Leamer advocates the use of null hypothesis 
testing in this case, the Court  [*52] finds that Dr. Leamer did in fact conduct such testing in this case because he conceded he 
did so, and further finds that he conducted such testing by using the 1%, 5% and 10% levels."
1600,27," This variable is one of the independent variables in Dr. Leamer's model which represents the sum of all new hires by all 
Defendants in a given year. Leamer Opening Fig. 5."
1600,28, Dr. Murphy did not make this criticism in any of his reports in opposition to class certification. 
1601,29," Defendants argue that if the Court does not strike the testimony Defendants cite, Defendants should be granted leave for Dr. 
Stiroh to submit a reply report. Strike Mot. at 10. The Court denies this  [*57] request because Dr. Leamer's opinions regarding 
the total new hires variable and nominal compensation do not comprise improper testimony, and thus there is no need for a 
surreply."
1601,30," While Defendants claim in their conclusion section that ""Dr. Leamer's proposed testimony regarding alleged impact and 
damages is unreliable and should be excluded in its entirety,"" Leamer Mot. at 15 (emphasis added), the substance of 
Defendants' motion challenges only Dr. Leamer's opinions relating to his  [*58] conduct regression model. "
1602,31," Defendants' other request, see Leamer Mot. at 8-10, to exclude Dr. Leamer's attempt to justify his original conduct regression 
with clustered errors based on his 50% significance theory, as set forth in his October 2013 opening report, is moot because the 
 [*60] Court has precluded Dr. Leamer from testifying about that opinion on other grounds. See supra Part III.A.3.a. "
1603,32," In re Silicone Gel Breast Implants Prods. Liab. Litig., 318 F. Supp. 2d 879 (C.D. Cal. Apr. 22, 2004), cited by Defendants, is 
inapposite as it does not stand for the proposition that a study is inadmissible unless it produces statistically significant results at 
the conventional levels. Henricksen v. ConocoPhillips Co., 605 F. Supp. 2d 1142 (E.D. Wash. Feb. 11, 2009), is similarly 
inapposite because it did not involve any regression model but concerned a qualitative study measuring benzene exposure of a 
very small sample size of twenty-one study participants."
1603,33," Reliance on statistical significance to determine the admissibility of expert evidence has been rejected by some courts in non-
antitrust contexts. See, e.g., Kadas, 255 F.3d at 362 (age discrimination suit). As the court observed in criticizing such reliance, 
""[l]itigation generally is not fussy about evidence; much eyewitness and other  [*66] nonquantitative evidence is subject to 
significant possibility of error, yet no effort is made to exclude it if doesn't satisfy some counterpart to the 5 percent significance 
test."" Id.; see also Rendon v. AT & T Technologies, 883 F.2d 388, 397-98 (5th Cir. 1989) (rejecting argument that there is a strict 
legal benchmark requiring a particular number of standard deviations to demonstrate that data has statistical significance); Heller 
v. Shaw Industries, Inc., 167 F.3d 146, 158 (3d Cir. 1999); Waisome v. Port Authority of New York & New Jersey, 948 F.2d 
1370, 1376 (2d Cir. 1991); MacDissi v. Valmont Industries, Inc., 856 F.2d 1054, 1058 n.3 (8th Cir. 1988). "
1604,34," Defendants cite an internal Google document which notes the existence of do-not-cold-call policies effective January 20, 2006 
with respect to OpenTV Corporation and Invidi Technologies Corporation. ECF No. 573, Brown Decl., Ex. 13. Plaintiffs do not 
appear to dispute the existence of these policies."
1604,35," This dummy variable technique is not uncommon in regression analysis.  [*69] Ref. Manual at 313 (""In an antitrust case, it 
may be a variable that takes on the value 1 to reflect the presence of the alleged anticompetitive behavior and the value 0 
otherwise"")."
1604,36," In fact, the evidence suggests that the agreements to which Defendants cite do not fit this criteria. Defendants have submitted 
evidence suggesting the Intel/Apple agreement  [*71] began in 2007, which is one year into the class period. Brown Decl., ECF 
No. 573, Ex. 11 at 82-83, 110. The Intel/Pixar agreement apparently started in 2008. Id., Ex. 12 at 158-62. Defendants have 
presented no evidence concerning when these agreements ended. Defendants concede that Google's unilateral policies were 
effective January 20, 2006, which is also well into the class period. Leamer Mot. at 11. Defendants cite evidence they claim 
shows that Google removed its Do Not Call List from Google's internal staffing website and staffing library in 2009. Id. Ex. 14 
(Google internal email on September 29, 2009 suggesting Google suspended any do-not-cold-call policies by removing them 
from internal staffing website and staffing library). "
1605,37," Plaintiffs' expert admitted that the model calculated  [*75] damages resulting from the alleged conduct ""as a whole"" and did not 
attribute damages to any one particular theory of impact. Comcast, 133 S. Ct. at 1434. The model assumed the validity of all four 
theories of antitrust impact initially advanced by Plaintiffs: decreased penetration by satellite providers, overbuilder deterrence, 
lack of benchmark competition, and increased bargaining power. Id."
1605,38," The Ninth Circuit cases that recite the disaggregation principle do not address the admissibility of the expert's analysis under 
Daubert  [*78] or otherwise, but rather consider the sufficiency of such evidence to prove other matters. For example, in City of 
Vernon, the plaintiff alleged the defendant engaged in anticompetitive practices by disallowing plaintiff's use of defendant's 
power transmission lines, maintaining rate schedules that were discriminatory, and preventing plaintiff from acquiring power from 
alternate suppliers. 955 F.2d at 1363. The plaintiff's damage study assumed that ""all of [these] acts contributed to the damage 
figure."" Id. at 1373. The district court found that some of the acts were lawful and that the damage estimate thus ""failed to 
segregate the losses, if any, caused by acts which were not antitrust violations from those that were."" Id. at 1372. Accordingly, 
the court granted defendant summary judgment because plaintiffs had presented no evidence of damages. Id. at 1372. On 
appeal, the Ninth Circuit affirmed because the plaintiff's aggregated damage proof (which encompassed claims which were 
dismissed) was unduly speculative and could not support a damage recovery. Id. at 1373. The Court notes that at the hearing on "
1606,," Defendants' motion to exclude Dr. Leamer's testimony, Defendants could not cite  [*79] to any case in the Ninth Circuit which 
applies or addresses the disaggregation principle in the Daubert context."
1606,39," This is precisely what distinguishes Defendants' other cited cases, where damages models failed to take into account critical 
variables that could have impacted the independent variable at issue. See Concord Boat Corp. v. Brunswick Corp., 207 F.3d 
1039, 1056 (8th Cir. 2000) (antitrust damages expert conceded his model, which ""ignored inconvenient evidence,"" completely 
failed to account  [*81] for various critical market events that could impact the independent variable); Blue Cross and Blue Shield 
United of Wisconsin v. Marshfield Clinic, 152 F.3d 588, 593 (7th Cir. 1998) (excluding statistical study which failed to correct for 
any other factor that could have affected the independent variable, price in clinical services, except for just one, thus effectively 
attributing the ""entire difference [in price] . . . to the [anticompetitive conduct.]""). "
1607,40," Defendants also assert in a footnote that ""Dr. Leamer's model [] cannot isolate the impact of the [anti-solicitation] agreements 
on compensation from other significant [macroeconomic and microeconomic events] during the class period,"" such as ""the 2008-
2009 recession, which would have negatively impacted compensation"" or ""the effect of Defendants' different responses to the 
recession in setting compensation."" Leamer Mot. at 11, 12 n.5 (recapping Stiroh Rebuttal ¶¶ 198-203). Defendants are incorrect. 
Dr. Leamer directly responded to Dr. Stiroh's criticism by noting he did control for these two particular factors by including ""highly 
pertinent market and firm-specific recession-sensitive variables"" like firm revenue, firm hiring,  [*82] total number of new hires, 
firm profit, and San Jose Information sector hiring. Leamer Reply Rep. ¶¶ 91-93. Indeed, the fact that Dr. Leamer's model 
includes various macro-economic variables to control for these factors distinguishes this case from In re REMEC Inc. Securities 
Litig., 702 F. Supp. 2d 1202, 1273-75 (S.D. Cal. Apr. 21, 2010) (excluding regression model under Daubert), which Defendants 
cite, Leamer Mot. at 11 n.4. In that case, the expert had made ""no attempt to account for other possible causes"" and failed to 
""incorporate major [macroeconomic] independent variables."" In re Remec, 702 F.Supp.2d at 1273 (citation omitted)."
1607,41," In Comcast, the Supreme Court held that the plaintiffs' inability to match their damages model with any one theory of liability 
meant the plaintiffs' damages case was not ""consistent with its liability case[.]"" Comcast, 133 S. Ct. at 1433."
1607,42," Defendants do not argue this case poses the same problem as in Comcast where the plaintiffs' damages model calculated 
damages resulting from various theories of impact, thus creating a situation in which the plaintiffs' damages case was 
inconsistent with its liability case because the model could not attribute damages to only the one theory of impact left  [*85] in 
the case. Nor could they, as there is no dispute that Dr. Leamer's model evaluates only one theory of antitrust injury - a decrease 
in compensation due to the anti-solicitation agreements."
1607,43," This variable was included by Dr. Leamer as a ""macro-factor to control for the overall demand for labor by all defendants."" 
Leamer Reply Rep. ¶ 131. "
1608,44," Specifically, Dr. Stiroh removed the ""total new hires"" variable from the model, and inserted three new variables: (1) total 
number of hires of [do-not-cold-call] firms, i.e., the number of hires of the firms with which a particular Defendant had 
agreements; (2) total number of hires of non-[do-not-cold-call] firms, i.e., the number of hires of the firms with which a particular 
defendant had no agreements (for the ADOBE variable, it is computed as the total number of hires by all non-APPLE 
defendants); and (3) the conduct variable interacted with the total number of new hires of [do-not-cold-call] firms. Stiroh Rebuttal 
¶ 187-88."
1608,45," Defendants do not explicitly state whether under Plaintiffs' theory, the impact of a Defendant's increase in hiring on another 
Defendant should be greater or smaller when the Defendant pair has an anti-solicitation agreement, compared to a Defendant 
pair that does not. "
1609,46," Further, while the Court need not resolve whether Dr. Stiroh's solution to this alleged problem is statistically sound, Dr. Leamer 
explains that her approach is not necessarily sound but is one way to effectively change around the signs of the regression 
coefficients. By removing the ""total new hires"" variable which has a large t-statistic compared to many of the other coefficients, 
see Leamer Opening, Ex. 3 (absolute value of 4.84), Dr. Stiroh's approach ""wreak[s] havoc on the [other] coefficients,"" thus 
disrupting the final damages estimate. Leamer Reply Rep. ¶ 115. Dr. Leamer's conclusion is not without support, see Edward 
Leamer, ""A Result on the Sign of Restricted Least Squares Estimates,"" Journal of Econometrics, 3 (1975) at 387-90. The 
 [*90] fact that Dr. Leamer's opinion finds support in his own scholarship weighs at least slightly in favor of finding his model 
does not fail the reliability prong. Daubert v. Merrell Dow. Pharm., Inc., 43 F.3d 1311, 1317 (9th Cir. 1995) (""One very significant 
fact to be considered is whether the experts are proposing to testify about matters growing naturally and directly out of research 
they have conducted independent of the litigation, or whether they have developed their opinions expressly for purposes of 
testifying."")."
1609,47," The Court notes that Defendants mischaracterize one of Plaintiffs' arguments, claiming Plaintiffs ""try to justify Dr. Leamer's 
total new hires variable as a 'macro-factor' that controls for overall labor demand."" Leamer Reply at 8. That is incorrect. Plaintiffs 
note that the variable controls ""for the overall demand for labor by all Defendants."" Leamer Opp. at 14 (emphasis in original) 
(citation omitted). Dr. Leamer has consistently testified the same. Leamer Reply Rep. ¶ 131."
1609,48," A ""dynamic"" regression model, or a ""distributed lag model,"" is one in which the statistician regresses  [*94] dependent variable 
""y"" at time t on the present and past values of independent variable ""x."" Larry D. Haugh et al., Identification of Dynamic 
Regression Models (Distributed Lag Models Connecting Two Time Series), 72 J. Am. Stat. Assoc. 121 (1977)."
1609,49," Dr. Leamer provided the same two explanations in his December 2013 deposition. Cisneros Decl., ECF No. 605, Ex. OOO at 
1189. "
1610,50," Maintaining this distinction between the evidentiary requirement of reliability and the higher standard of whether the expert's 
conclusions are correct ""is indeed significant as it preserves the fact finding role of the jury."" In re TMI Litig., 193 F.3d 613, 665 
n.90 (3d Cir. 1999)."
1610,51," Dr. Leamer also explains that the negative sign may be the result of ""collinearity among the variables,"" Leamer Reply Rep. ¶ 
61, which means that multiple correlated independent variables are competing to explain the same dependent variable. Id. at 61, 
72; see also ABA Section of Antitrust Law, Proving Antitrust Damages: Legal and Economic Issues, Ch. 6, ""Economics and 
Regression Analysis"" at 150 (2010) (""Proving Antitrust Damages""). While the Court acknowledges that collinearity may cause 
regression estimates to becomes less precise,  [*95] see Realcomp II, Ltd. v. F.T.C., 635 F.3d 815, 834 (6th Cir. 2011); Ref. 
Manual at 324; Rubinfeld at 465, Defendants have not raised this issue nor provided any argument as to why this would deem 
Dr. Leamer's model unreliable under the Daubert standard. Other courts have admitted regressions even in the face of expert 
disagreement regarding whether collinearity posed a problem. In re High Fructose Corn Syrup Antitrust Lit., 295 F.3d 651, 660-
61 (7th Cir. 2002) (refusing to second-guess district court's admission of defense regression analysis where parties' experts 
disagreed on whether collinearity problem had been resolved or if regression was fundamentally unreliable). This is not 
surprising given that the concept of collinearity is not a methodology, but a common phenomenon that results when using the 
methodology of regression analysis. Daubert, 509 U.S. at 595 (""The focus [of the admissibility inquiry], of course, must be solely 
on principles and methodology, not on the conclusions that they generate."")."
1610,52," See also Edward Leamer, Global Sensitivity Results for Generalized Least Squares Estimates, 79 J. Am. Stat. Assoc. 867-70 
(1984) (considering sensitivity of regression estimates). "
1611,53," ""Sensitivity analysis is the study of how the variation in the output of a model (numerical or otherwise) can be apportioned, 
qualitatively and quantitatively, to different sources of variation, and how the given model depends on the information fed into it. . 
. . It allows the analyst  [*99] to assess the effects on inferences of departures from the assumptions made and the data values, 
[and] detect outliers or wrong data values . . ."" Enrique Castillo, et al., A general method for local sensitivity analysis with 
application to regression models and other optimization problems, 46.4 Technometrics 430 (2004); see also D.W. Bacon et al., A 
profile-based approach to parametric sensitivity analysis of nonlinear regression models, 43.4 Technometrics 425 (2001) 
(""Predictions from a nonlinear regression model are subject to uncertainties propagated from the estimated parameters in the 
model. Parameters exerting the strongest influence on model predictions can be identified by a sensitivity analysis."")."
1611,54," At the same time, Defendants also claim that the change they implement (changing Intel's participation date from 2005 to 
2006) is just a ""minor modification,"" Leamer Reply at 10, but fail to explain why such a change would be ""minor"" compared to 
other changes in assumptions that one could make to the model."
1611,55," Dr. Leamer alludes to this point when explaining that the fact that the damages estimate changes substantially when the date 
of Intel's agreement is changed by one year does  [*100] not mean his model is unreliable but is an expected outcome. Leamer 
Reply Rep. ¶ 112 (""[C]hanging the date of the conspiracy would be expected to have substantial changes in the measured effect 
of the conduct. It's not just that a portion of Intel's employment is being removed from the class, but that some suppressed 
compensation is then being treated as 'normal.'""). While Dr. Leamer does not explain in further detail why the resulting change in 
his estimate does not render his results unreliable, ""gaps"" in an expert's reasoning may go to the weight of the expert evidence, 
not its admissibility. Campbell ex rel. Campbell v. Metro. Prop. & Cas. Ins. Co., 239 F.3d 179, 186 (2nd Cir. 2001)."
1611,56," At the hearing on Defendants' motion to exclude Dr. Leamer's testimony, Defendants  [*102] could not cite to any case which 
holds that the sensitivity of a dependent variable to one or more independent variables in a regression model means the model 
must be deemed unreliable under Daubert. "
1612,57," Dr. Leamer  [*105] explained that his regression estimated total undercompensation per defendant per year. Brown Decl., 
ECF No. 573, Ex. 1, Oct. 2012 Leamer Dep. at 56. "
1613,58," Such a finding was not required for Plaintiffs to attain class certification. In re Cardizem CD Antitrust Litigation, 200 F.R.D. 326, 
340 (E.D. Mich. Apr. 3, 2001) (""To show impact is susceptible to class-wide proof, Plaintiffs are not required to show that the fact 
of injury actually exists for each class member."")."
1613,59," These ""thousands of pages"" included ""documentary evidence on the importance of cold calling as a recruitment tool and the 
effect of the preclusion of cold calling on the Technical Class as a whole,"" ""evidence of Defendants' rigid compensation structure 
and importance of internal equity,"" and ""documentary evidence that Defendants viewed each other as labor competitors, which 
may have resulted in individual Defendants' wage suppression depressing other Defendants' employees' wages."" October Order 
at 33."
1613,60," Defendants' citation to In re Plastics Additives, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 90135, 2010 WL 3431837 (E.D. Pa. Aug. 31, 2010), is 
unavailing. There, a district court in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania found that the plaintiffs had not demonstrated that 
antitrust impact was ""capable of proof by evidence common to  [*110] the class"" and thus denied class certification. 2010 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 90135, [WL] at *19. In doing so, the court held plaintiffs' regression model could not ""serve as proof of impact 
common to the class"" because the model said ""nothing about individual class member experience"" and plaintiffs' expert had 
conceded that his ""industrywide regression results are in no way indicative of individual impact"" and ""do not help determine "
1614,," whether each class member suffered any impact[.]"" 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 90135, [WL] at *15-*16 (emphasis added). Here, in 
contrast, this case is not at the class certification stage, and Dr. Leamer does not concede that his model is not at all probative to 
whether each class member suffered an impact. The Court also notes that the In re Plastics court utilized a higher standard at 
the class certification stage than this Court, which held at the class certification stage that Dr. Leamer's model ""support[ed] 
Plaintiffs' theories of common impact of harm,"" October Order at 52, 72, despite the fact that his model did not purport to show 
individualized impact to each class member. "
1628,**," This summary constitutes no part of the opinion of the court. It has been prepared by court staff for the convenience of the 
reader."
1628,*," The Honorable David A. Ezra, District Judge for the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, sitting by designation. "
1629,1," Because this case is an appeal of a motion to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), the facts are taken from the complaint 
and viewed in the light most favorable to Samsung."
1629,2," The SD Defendants argue that their behavior was a pro-competitive patent pool. The district court did not reach the merits of 
Samsung's claims. We also express no position on the substance of the complaint. "
1630,3," Other circuits have adopted similar standards. See, e.g., Varner v. Peterson Farms, 371 F.3d 1011, 1019 (8th Cir. 2004) 
(adopting the Pace standard); Al George, Inc. v. Envirotech Corp., 939 F.2d 1271, 1275 (5th Cir. 1991) (same); Peck v. Gen. 
Motors Corp., 894 F.2d 844, 849 (6th Cir. 1990) (""Since the Supreme Court decided Zenith, federal courts have uniformly"" 
recognized the continuing violation exception (citing Pace, 813 F.2d at 237)). "
1632,4," California's UCL incorporates violations of substantive statutes and makes them punishable as unfair business practices. Cal. 
Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200. While the district court permissibly dismissed the UCL claim once it had decided that Samsung no 
longer had any other substantive legal claims on which to rest its UCL arguments, that underlying decision is no longer accurate 
 [**15] and the UCL claim must be reinstated. The Cartwright Act claim was dismissed based on a holding that the interpretation of California's antitrust statute was 
coextensive with the Sherman Act. This is no longer the law in California. Aryeh v. Canon Business Solutio ns, Inc., 55 Cal. 4th 
1185, 1195, 151 Cal. Rptr. 3d 827, 292 P.3d 871 (2013) (""Interpretations of federal antitrust law are at most instructive, not 
conclusive, when construing the Cartwright Act, given that the Cartwright Act was modeled not on federal antitrust statutes but 
instead on statutes enacted by California's sister states around the turn of the 20th century."" (citing State of California ex rel. Van 
de Kamp v. Texaco, Inc., 46 Cal. 3d 1147, 252 Cal. Rptr. 221, 762 P.2d 385 (1988))). This claim is remanded to the district court 
for a determination in the first instance of whether California law permits a Cartwright Act claim under the circumstances alleged 
in Samsung's complaint. "
1640,1," On reply, defendants acknowledge that Florida's original complaint was filed some two months earlier, and that therefore as to 
the subset of the current defendants who were named in that complaint, the cutoff date would be earlier. "
1642,2," While other aspects of this decision are likely undermined by the holding in AT&T Mobility, the rejection of any necessity to 
apply a choice of law analysis under Shutts is not."
1642,3," Florida suggests that because defendants have not raised a due process challenge to Count I (seeking injunctive relief under 
state and federal statutes) or to Count IV (the FDUTPA claim), its attack on Count III must fail. Even assuming the portion of 
Counts I and IV that would involve applying Florida law to the purportedly-assigned ""direct purchases"" may be barred, 
defendants' election not to parse those counts does not preclude them from challenging Count III, which only arises from ""direct 
purchases"" and state law."
1642,4, This argument is moot as to the FAA claim unless and until Florida amends to allege a sufficient connection to the state.
1642,5," In different factual circumstances, the court in Sanctuary Surgical Centre, Inc. v. United Healthcare, Inc., 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
150032, 2011 WL 6935289, at *4 (S.D. Fla. Dec. 30, 2011)  [*32] required the plaintiff to allege the specific terms of 
assignments it contended created standing. While imposing such a requirement may be appropriate in some instances, 
Sanctuary Surgical does not compel a conclusion that the allegations are insufficient here."
1642,6," The scheduling of any such motion, however, must be appropriately addressed in the case management process. "
1651,1," Such statutes also tend to require the plaintiff's expectations to be reasonable, an issue that the Court does not reach. "
1652,2," At oral argument, Plaintiffs directed the Court to two cases that they claimed support the proposition that a product's price or 
color can be an actionable statement. The Court has reviewed both cases and they are not on point. In Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. 
Samara Bros., Inc., 529 U.S. 205, 120 S. Ct. 1339, 146 L. Ed. 2d 182 (2000), a Lanham Act case, the Supreme Court held that a 
product's design, like its color, cannot be inherently distinctive and can only be protected as trade dress if it has acquired 
secondary meaning. Wal-Mart has no bearing on the consumer false advertising claims in issue here. In Miller v. Ghirardelli 
Chocolate Co., 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 49733, 2013 WL 1402682 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 5, 2013), the Court found that the plaintiff stated 
CRLA, FAL, UCL, and  [**14] fraud claims against Ghirardelli for misleading consumers into believing that its ""Ghirardelli 
Chocolate's Premium Baking Chips—Classic White"" (""baking chips"") were white chocolate, when in fact the baking chips did not "
1653,," contain any chocolate ingredients in violation of the FDA's ""white chocolate standard,"" parallel California regulations, and FDA 
and California label requirements. Because the claims in Miller were premised on an actual statement on the product's package 
— the word ""chocolate"" — it is not analogous to this case. In addition, price did not play a role in the Miller court's analysis. In 
short, neither Wal-Mart nor Miller aid Plaintiffs. "
1654,3," Wal-Mart attempts to justify the price difference between Equate Migraine and Equate ES as related to different FDA approval 
processes applicable to each medication. HN12[
] Procedurally, matters beyond the pleadings generally cannot be considered 
when deciding a motion to dismiss. Substantively, as discussed herein,  [**19] the Court is aware of no law requiring Wal-Mart to 
justify this price difference in the first place. "
1656,4," Because Plaintiffs' claims insofar as they are based on Equate Migraine's price and red packaging are dismissed with prejudice 
for failure to state a claim, the Court will not address whether they comply with Rule 9(b). "
1661,1," Defendants note that Indirect Purchasers appear to name Leah Kapoor as an Indirect Purchaser Plaintiff in their Motion. If so, 
that would be Kapoor's debut in this case, never having been listed in any prior filing nor proposed to be joined as an Indirect 
Purchaser Plaintiff. In reply, Indirect Purchasers refer to Kapoor as a ""member of the Class,"" but in the next sentence assert 
""[p]ersons other than named plaintiffs are routinely identified as adequate class representatives."" This Court understands that 
response as a concession that Kapoor cannot be a named Indirect Purchaser Plaintiff. Therefore, this Court grants Defendants' "
1662,," Motion to Strike Kapoor's name from Indirect Purchaser's Motion under Federal Civil Rule 12(f). Unnamed plaintiffs may 
""routinely be identified as adequate class representatives"" in Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (""PSLRA"") actions (see id. 
(citing In re Oxford Health Plans, Inc., 191 F.R.D. 369, 378 (S.D.N.Y. 2000) (""[B]eing a Lead Plaintiff under the PSLRA is not the 
same as being a Class Representative under Rule 23"")), but Indirect Purchasers have identified no comparable aspect of 
antitrust class action litigation that makes the same appointment scheme [**13]  permissible, much less ""routine."""
1662,2," The Department of Justice (""DOJ"") and Federal Trade Commission (""FTC"") use HHI to estimate how a horizontal merger or 
acquisition might affect concentration in a market. See generally U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND THE FEDERAL TRADE COMM., 
HORIZONTAL MERGER GUIDELINES, available at http://ftc.gov/os/2010/08/100819hmg.pdf. Prior to 2010 revisions to the Merger 
Guidelines, the foam industry's HHI score fell within the ""highly concentrated"" market (Doc. 581 at 21). "
1668,3," This Court denied FXI's Request for Leave to File the Declaration of Dr. Su Sun, attacking aspects of Dr. Leitzinger's impact 
and damages models. FXI's Motion came fully nine months after Dr. Leitzinger's initial report, which was accompanied by all the 
data upon which Dr. Sun's declaration relies. Moreover, Defendants had at least seven opportunities to critique Dr. Leitzinger's "
1669,," analysis -- Defendants (1) filed an Opposition to the Direct Purchaser Motion, (2-3) deposed Dr. Leitzinger twice, (4-5) filed two 
rounds [**36]  of expert reports (the latter of which gave Defendants the ""last word"" in the written back-and-forth between 
experts, contrary to the initial briefing order), (6) presented attorney argument and their own experts' comments on Leitzinger's 
analysis at this Court's hearing on class certification, and (7) filed hearing binders, containing written responses to this Court's 
pre-hearing questions. That amount of argument and evidence suffices, and FXI presents this Court no good reason why Dr. 
Sun's analysis could not have earlier been brought to this Court's attention. This Court will, however, accept as undisputed 
Direct Purchasers' concession that technical foam is not part of the class definition."
1669,4," Incidentally, this Court asked the parties for their ""best case"" demonstrating whether class certification should be granted or 
denied [**39]  with respect to Direct Purchasers. Defense counsel cited not a case, but a summary order, issued by the Sixth 
Circuit and directing the district court in Merenda to reconsider, in light of Comcast, its earlier order certifying an antitrust class. 
Defense counsel argues that summary order, issued after the opinion on remand in In re Whirlpool Corp., means the ""Sixth 
Circuit now gives attention to Comcast."" See Cason-Merenda, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29447, 2014 WL 905828, at *1 (discussing 
the summary order). Upon reconsideration, the district court reaffirmed its earlier conclusion. "
1671,5," This Court has reviewed the expert reports of Dr. Matthew Gordon, the Sentinel Group, and Gordon's reply report. Gordon's 
analysis uses the ""Palantir Gotham platform"" to ""produce a visual representation of the events and entities"" in this case, 
selecting three case studies to describe, in narrative and graphic form, the ""webs"" of communications between Defendants in 
three-month periods in which price increase letters were issued. The Sentinel Group assails Gordon's analysis to some effect, 
noting for example that Gordon does not demonstrate any particular knowledge of the industry he examines or, critically in this 
Court's view, provide any context for the communication ""webs."" See also id. at 16 (""Without an assessment and understanding 
of 'normal' communications patterns in the foam industry, Dr. Gordon has no basis to conclude [**46]  that communications 
'spiked' before price increase letters were issued or that the existence of communications before price increase letters was 
anomalous or indicative of anti-competitive behavior.""). However, in view of the other common liability evidence offered, and that 
discovery of Gordon's source materials is ongoing, this Court need not examine these reports in detail because it can reach a 
predominance determination based on other common evidence of liability. "
1676,6," Defendants claim Leitzinger's models is misspecified because it uses as its but-for benchmark the quarter preceding a price 
increase letter. In Defendants' view, the true but-for benchmark would be that in a quarter which price increase letters were 
issued, but no conspiracy is alleged to have existed (see Doc. 967 at 107 (""In a but-for world there are no agreements and you 
have price letters""); Doc. 892-1 at 31-32). Defendants never confront Leitzinger's persuasive justification for using a quarter-
over-quarter benchmark -- that it is contrary to economic theory to assume a valid price increase letter would independently drive 
prices higher than market conditions otherwise would demand. Leitzinger asserts the but-for price is one generated without the 
incremental and anticompetitive price affects of a conspiratorial letter, and Defendants present no persuasive economic basis 
suggesting a valid price increase letter might generate similar incremental price affects. "
1685,7," The Supreme Court recently explained, ""'[a] study that is statistically significant has results that are unlikely to be the result of 
random error . . . .' To test for significance, a researcher develops a ""null hypothesis"" -- e.g., the assertion that there is no 
relationship between [price increase letters] and [actual prices]. The researcher then calculates the probability of obtaining the 
observed data (or more extreme data) if the null hypothesis is true (called [**100]  the p-value). Small p-values are evidence that 
the null hypothesis is incorrect. The researcher compares the p-value to a preselected value called the significance level. If the 
p-value is below the preselected value, the difference is deemed 'significant.'"" Matrixx Initiatives, Inc. v. Siracusano, 563 U.S. 27, 
131 S. Ct. 1309, 1319 n.6, 179 L. Ed. 2d 398 (2011) (internal citations omitted). "
1703,8," In its ""downstream discovery"" orders, this Court denied Indirect Purchasers access to Direct Purchasers and Direct Action 
Plaintiffs' cost and sales information. Indirect Purchasers pursued such information, for purposes of passthrough analysis, using 
third-party subpoenas. Indirect Purchasers correctly note in their Daubert Opposition that obtaining comprehensive cost and 
sales data from ""millions of individual purchases throughout the [end-use] chain of distribution . . . would be hideously 
expensive."" "
1723,1," Defendants are AXA Advisors, LLC; AXA Network, LLC; AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company; AXA Distributors, LLC; AXA 
Distributors Insurance Agency, LLC; and AXA Distributors Insurance Agency of Massachusetts, LLC (collectively, Defendants or 
AXA)"
1723,2," These factual allegations are taken from the Amended Complaint. ECF 15. They are presumed true for the purpose of 
adjudicating AXA's motion. Farran v. City of Nassau, 11 F.3d 21, 22 (2d Cir. 1993). "
1724,3, The Representative Agreement does not have a twelve-year vesting requirement. See ECF 15 Ex. 2. 
1725,4," The New York Court of Appeals has held that HN2[
] the Donnelly Act was modelled on the Sherman Act and should 
generally be construed in light of federal precedent. X.L.O. Concrete Corp. v. Rivergate Corp., 83 N.Y.2d 513, 518, 634 N.E.2d 
158, 611 N.Y.S.2d 786 (1994). "
1726,5," The Court refers to Mooney's characterization of the relevant  [**12] labor market as ""AXA-affiliated employees"" or ""AXA-
affiliated agents."""
1726,6," As discussed infra, Bogan offers no support for such a proposition."
1726,7," Plaintiff has alleged a written agreement between Leaders and AXA that delineates the alleged unreasonable restraint raised in 
the Amended Complaint. This is sufficient to satisfy the concerted action element of Plaintiff's § 1 claim. "
1728,8," Mooney has alleged that AXA sells insurance across the United States. ECF 15 ¶ 5 (Preliminary Facts). This is sufficient to 
plead a relevant geographic market. The Court's inquiry centers on the allegations surrounding the relevant product market. "
1729,9," Although E.I. du Pont concerned a § 2 monopolization claim, the concerns expressed in the opinion about single-brand markets 
have been cited widely in cases with § 1 claims. See, e.g., Mathias v. Daily News, L.P., 152 F. Supp. 2d 465, 482 (S.D.N.Y. 
2001). "
1731,10," Counts IV, V, and VI are governed by New York law."
1731,11," Unlike the Associate Agreement, the Representative Agreement does not expressly state when commissions will vest in 
Mooney; rather, it only provides that commissions may be paid according to schedules and rules that AXA Advisors may publish 
from time to time. ECF 15 Ex. 2, § III. Mooney, however, alleges that he was entitled to vested commissions from AXA Advisors 
under the Representative Agreement. Such commissions, he alleges, were contingent on his ""credited"" period of continuous 
service and that he received those commissions while working for AXA. ECF 15 ¶¶ 10, 22 (Preliminary Facts)."
1731,12," Mooney does not expressly allege when AXA started  [**31] paying him vested commissions. Ostensibly, his vested 
commission payments would have started in 2006. See ECF 15 ¶ 5 (Count IV) (alleging being credited eighteen years of 
continuous service at the time of his resignation in 2012—which suggests Mooney had twelve years of credited service in 2006). 
Even though this allegation is not expressly made, reading the complaint in the light most favorable to Mooney—which the Court 
must do in this procedural posture—the complaint implicitly alleges that AXA was paying him these commissions from 2006 to 
2012 and that the commissions stopped once he left AXA's employment."
1731,13, The Representative Agreement does not contain an Integration Clause. See ECF 15 Ex. 2. 
1734,14," Count III is governed by Ohio law, by agreement of the parties. "
1735,15," At the outset, AXA's invocation of the innocent construction rule is unpersuasive. If the alleged statements are found to be 
factual and communicated outside a privilege, they unambiguously disparage Mooney and would  [**45] tend to injure his trade 
or occupation. See McKimm v. Ohio Elections Comm'n, 89 Ohio St. 3d 139, 2000 Ohio 118, 729 N.E. 2d 364, 373 (Ohio 2000) 
(explaining that HN29[
] the ""innocent-construction rule"" only applies to statements that ""are reasonably susceptible to an 
innocent construction"" (emphasis in original)). "
1737,16," HN36[
] Although qualified privilege is in the nature of an affirmative defense, on a motion to dismiss, Ohio courts look to see 
if the requirements of the privilege exist on the face of the complaint. See Bell v. Horton, 107 Ohio App. 3d 824, 669 N.E. 2d 
546, 550 (Ohio Ct. App. 1995)."
1737,17," In a letter to the Court, ECF 30, AXA directed the Court's attention to a recent case published in the Appellate Division of the 
New York Supreme Court. See Frechtman v. Gutterman, 115 A.D.3d 102, 979 N.Y.S.2d 58 (App. Div. 2014). Aside from the fact 
that Ohio law governs the disposition of this claim, the opinion in Frechtman does not add anything to the points of law already 
discussed. "

1748,3," Wells Fargo & Company and its wholly owned subsidiary Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. were named co-conspirators in Ross v. Bank 
of America, but were not defendants in these actions."
1748,4," At that time, the firm was known as Wilmer Cutler & Pickering LLP. In 2004, it became Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr 
LLP. In 2005, it became WilmerHale. This Court refers to the firm as ""WilmerHale."" "
1749,5," The other Issuing Banks in attendance were Capital One, Chase, First USA, Household, and Providian. (PX-0032). "

1751,8, Siegel also recorded Sears' and GE Capital's positions about arbitration. (PX-0110.)
1751,9," Additionally, Siegel expressed her view that First USA had created a ""catch-22 situation"" by using NAF as its arbitration 
administrator because NAF was perceived as a ""creditor's tool."" (PX-0110.) "
1752,10," The other Issuing Banks invited were Bank of America, Chase, First USA, Household, and MBNA. "
1753,11, The other Issuing Banks in attendance were First USA/Bank One and Household. (PX-5082; PX-5083; PX-7591.)

1756,19," At trial, this Court reserved decision on the admissibility of PX-6022. PX-6022 is now received in evidence and this Court 
evaluates its probative value in view of questions about its authentication."
1756,20," The other Issuing Banks in attendance were Capital One, Chase, First USA/Bank One, Household, MBNA, and Providian. 
(PX-6022.) "
1758,21," The other Issuing Banks invited were Bank of America, Capital One, Chase, First USA/Bank One, Household, and MBNA."
1758,22," The other Issuing Banks in attendance were  [**45] Bank One/First USA, Capital One, Household, and MBNA. (PX-6062.)"
1758,23," There is also a handwritten  [**46] attendance list for an Arbitration Coalition meeting on January 13, 2002. (PX-1262.) 
Because that was a Sunday, the date was likely recorded in error. This Court concludes, however, that an additional meeting did 
take place on an unknown date. Amex (Heine) attended, along with Chase (Siegel), Lipsett and Mogilnicki (WilmerHale), 
Kaplinsky (Ballard), and Duncan MacDonald. (PX-1262.) Representatives from Hangley Aronchick, Bradley Arant, American 
Financial Services Association, American Business Financial Services, and MONY Life Insurance were also present. (PX-1262.)"

1759,25," The other Issuing Banks in attendance were Capital One, Chase, First USA/Bank One, Providian, and MBNA."
1759,26," The other Issuing Banks in attendance were Capital One, Chase, First USA/Bank One, Providian, and MBNA. "
1763,27," This Court takes judicial notice of the CFPB Study pursuant to Rule 201. HN5[
] Rule 201 allows this Court to take such notice ""at any stage of the proceeding"" if the judicially noticed facts are ""not subject to reasonable dispute,"" that is, they ""can be 
accurately and readily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot readily be questioned,"" Fed. R. Evid. 201(b) and (d). 
Defendants object on three grounds to this Court's consideration of the CFPB Study: the timeliness of Plaintiffs' request, the 
reliability of the CFPB Study, and on hearsay grounds. Defendants' objections are overruled: First, HN6[
] judicial notice may be taken ""at any stage of the proceeding,"" including as late as on appeal. See, e.g., United States v. Davis, 726 F.3d 357, 368 (2d Cir. 2013) (concluding that judicial notice during appeal is appropriate); 
Trigueros v. Adams, 658 F.3d 983, 987 (9th Cir. 2011) (same). Second, HN7[
] Courts may take judicial notice of data contained in Government reports. See, e.g., Denius v. Dunlap, 330 F.3d 919, 926 (7th Cir. 2003) (concluding that a district court may take  [**65] judicial notice of information on an official 
government website); Kramer v. Time Warner Inc., 937 F.2d 767, 774 (2d Cir. 1991) (holding that district courts may take 
judicial notice of the contents of certain public records). It is true that the CFPB Study results are ""subject to revision ... if 
further analysis so warrants."" (CFPB Study at 4.) But it is telling that Defendants do not point out any errors in the report. 
And extrapolation from Elzinga's market share charts, see PX-8539A; PX-8539B; PX-8539C; PX-8539D, reaches much the 
same result as the CFPB Study. Third, the CFPB Study is admissible as a hearsay rule exception because the report is a public record. See HN8[
] Fed. R. Evid. 803(8). This exception applies when the document is ""a record or statement of a public office [that] sets out: (i) the 
office's activities; (ii) a matter observed while under a legal duty to report. . ."" and ""neither the source of information nor 
other circumstances indicate a lack of trustworthiness."" Fed. R. Evid. 803(8). HN9[
] Section 1028(a) of the Dodd-Frank 
Act imposes on the CFPB the legal obligation to study the use of pre-dispute arbitration clauses in consumer financial 
products and services and report  [**66] its findings to Congress. 12 U.S.C. § 5518(a). Indisputably, the CFPB Study is the 
product of that legal mandate."
1763,28," This Court credits Plaintiffs' compelling evidence that Discover's opt-out option—utilized by less than 0.1% of cardholders—did 
not meaningfully counteract any loss in consumer choice. (See generally TT at 2746:23-2763:5, 3205:14-3207:25 (Bar-Gill).) "
1767,29," Courts may draw an inference of interdependent parallelism more easily from simultaneous parallelism than sequential 
parallelism because concerted action in the absence  [**79] of knowledge of or time to react to a competitor's action is 
improbable. See In re Digital Music Antitrust Litig., 592 F. Supp. 2d 435, 445 (2008) vacated on other grounds by Starr v. Sony 
BMG Music Entm't, 592 F.3d 314 (2d Cir. 2010). But that is not this case. "
1774,30," At trial, Plaintiffs seemed to argue that the F/X conspiracy provided a motive for the arbitration conspiracy, i.e. to foreclose the 
possibility that the Issuing Banks could be sued for failing to disclose F/X fees. Plaintiffs appear to have abandoned that 
argument in their post-trial briefing. But to the extent they have not, this Court finds no evidence of such a motive. "
1777,31," In doing so, this Court takes heed of Judge Leval's advice that ""we  [**120] should not disguise dictum, but should forthrightly 
label it as what it is."" Pierre N. Leval, ""Judging Under the Constitution: Dicta About Dicta."" 81 NYU L. Rev. 1249, 1282 (2006). "
1785,1," The Court issues a partial decision and order on the issue of waiver of privilege to facilitate discovery in this matter. The 
remainder of the Court's decision  [*13] will be issued in a later memorandum decision and order."
1785,2," The Defendants to whom the motion is directed are: Driscoll Potatoes, Inc.; Blaine Larsen; Blaine Larsen Farms, Inc.; Albert T. 
Wada; Wada Farms, Inc.; Wada Farms Potatoes, Inc.; Wada-Van Orden Potatoes, Inc.; Wada Farms Marketing Group, LLC; 
Wada Family LLC; Pro Fresh LLC; Cedar Farms, Inc.; Snake River Plains Potatoes, Inc.; Raybould Brothers Farms LLC; United 
Potato Growers of Idaho, Inc.; United Potato Growers of America, Inc.; United II Potato Growers of Idaho, Inc.; R.D. Offutt 
Company; Ronald D. Offutt, Jr.; and Potandon LLC (collectively ""Defendants""). However, there are four groups of Defendants to 
which the Court will refer. The Andersen  [*14] Defendants to whom the Motion is directed are represented by attorney Steve 
Andersen, and include: Albert T. Wada; Wada Farms, Inc.; Wada Farms Potatoes, Inc.; Wada-Van Orden Potatoes, Inc.; Wada 
Farms Marketing Group, LLC; Wada Family LLC; Pro Fresh LLC; Cedar Farms, Inc.; Snake River Plains Potatoes, Inc.; 
Raybould Brothers Farms LLC; United Potato Growers of Idaho, Inc.; United Potato Growers of America, Inc.; and United II 
Potato Growers of Idaho, Inc. The Offutt Defendants, or as Plaintiffs refer to them, the RDO Defendants, are: R.D. Offutt 
Company and Ronald D. Offutt, Jr. The Court will refer to these Defendants as the Offutt Defendants. Then, there are the Orrick 
Defendants, represented by the firm Orrick Herrington & Sutcliffe, who include Blaine Larsen; Blaine Larsen Farms, Inc.; and 
Driscoll Potatoes, Inc. Finally, Potandon, LLC submitted its own response brief, and will be referred to as Potandon."
1785,3," Several Defendants chastised Plaintiffs for filing only one brief, criticizing Plaintiffs for their lack of specificity and ""indiscriminate 
lumping"" of all parties together. However, Plaintiffs complied with Court's Order, and the Court was able to discern the parties' 
arguments upon review of the privilege logs submitted with Plaintiffs' motion. The Court appreciates Plaintiffs' brevity, although it 
cannot say the same for the thousands of pages of documents that were not highlighted in any manner that the Court was 
required to sift through to resolve the pending motion. "
1787,4," The Andersen Defendants rely upon the arguments asserted by the Orrick Defendants and referred to those arguments in their 
brief. Andersen Defendants' Response Brief at 7 (Dkt. 572.) "
1788,5," Although the Court approved the parties' waiver, it did so via docket entry order and without a hearing or other inquiry. (Dkt. 
500)."
1788,6," Footnote 14 of the Blue Cross decision is particularly apropos here in light of these Defendants' claim  [*25] of their artful 
drafting, and is quoted in its entirety: The use of the ambiguous phrase ""and/or"" has been ""frequently condemned as improper and confusing,"" and at least one 
court has construed the phrase against the drafter. See Newlon v. Newlon, 310 Ky. 737, 220 S.W. 2d 961, 963 (Ky.1949). 
See also Moran v. Shern, 60 Wis.2d 39, 208 N.W. 2d 348, 351 (Wis.1973): ""'and/or,' that befuddling, nameless thing, that 
Janus-faced verbal monstrosity, neither word nor phrase, the child of a brain of someone too lazy or too dull to express his 
precise meaning, or too dull to know what he did mean, now commonly used by lawyers in drafting legal documents, 
through carelessness or ignorance or as a cunning device to conceal rather than express meaning with view to furthering 
the interests of their clients.""; Raine v. Drasin, 621 S.W. 2d 895, 905 (Ky.1981): ""error is achieved by use of the much 
condemned conjunctive-disjunctive crutch of sloppy thinkers, and/or."""
1788,7," Not to make light of the issue, but the donut analogy was particularly helpful in analyzing the effect of the waiver and 
 [*28] illustrating the result. "
1790,8," Although the Orrick Defendants did not provide the documents they continue to withhold for in camera review, they gave 
examples in their brief. Orrick Defendants continue to withhold marketing agreements between growers or sheds associated with 
local cooperatives; internal documents about  [*33] the formation of a Driscoll family cooperative; documents containing legal 
advice relating to how Driscoll calculates compensation to potato growers; and documents about the termination of membership 
in certain cooperatives. Brief at 10-11 (Dkt. 569.) Orrick Defendants claim these types of documents do not reflect upon what 
they believed about the applicability of Capper-Volstead, although they concede that some documents relate to Plaintiffs' claims. 
These documents must be produced if Orrick Defendants rely upon the advice of counsel defense. They provide context to 
Defendants' conduct, organization, structure, and motives. Further, Rule 26(b)(1) indicates parties may obtain discovery 
regarding matters ""relevant to any party's claim or defense."" Thus, Orrick Defendants' arguments that they need not produce 
privileged documents related to Plaintiffs' claims is without merit if they intend to assert the advice of counsel defense. Plaintiffs 
are entitled to the documents given the reliance upon the defense of advice of counsel. And, if the documents the Court was not 
privileged to see are anything like the Andersen Defendants' documents it did review, they should be produced. "
1799,1," As noted in prior  [**13] orders, Division I was known as the ""University Division"" prior to 1973. In college football, the division 
now consists of two subdivisions known as the ""Division I Football Bowl Subdivision"" (FBS) and the ""Division I Football 
Championship Subdivision"" (FCS). For the sake of simplicity, this order refers generally to all of these divisions as ""Division I."""
1799,2," Unless otherwise noted, all subsequent references to ""Plaintiffs"" in this order are meant to denote the twenty Antitrust Plaintiffs. "
1801,3," See, e.g., NCAA v. Board of Regents of Univ. of Oklahoma, 468 U.S. 85, 101-02, 104 S. Ct. 2948, 82 L. Ed. 2d 70 (1984) 
(noting in dicta that the NCAA's ban on student-athlete pay helps ""preserve the character and quality"" of its product). This Court 
has previously explained why Board of Regents — which does not examine the NCAA's ban on student-athlete compensation 
under the rule of reason — does not control the outcome of this case. See Docket No. 876, Oct. 25, 2013 Order, at 8-16."
1801,4," Although the NCAA contends that a ""quick look"" analysis is inappropriate, it argues that the eligibility rules challenged by 
Plaintiffs should  [**23] nevertheless ""be presumed to be procompetitive because they are essential for the NCAA to produce a 
unique product."" Docket No. 926, NCAA Cross-Mot. Summ. J., at 8. Such a presumption is not useful here for the same reasons 
that Plaintiffs' requested presumption is not useful. "
1802,5," While some of this expert evidence was only submitted with Plaintiffs' class certification motion, Plaintiffs' expert, Dr. Noll, has 
incorporated it by reference in his latest report. "
1804,6," As previously noted, this order addresses only the Antitrust Plaintiffs' claims and not the Right-of-Publicity Plaintiffs' claims. 
Although the following sections discuss the scope of student-athletes' publicity rights, the discussion focuses on whether those 
rights could, absent the challenged restraint, give rise to a market for group licenses. The Court does not analyze the viability of 
Right-of-Publicity Plaintiffs' claims, which remain stayed pending EA's petition for certiorari. "
1805,7," Although the athletic association was technically a state actor, the Seventh Circuit made clear that this fact did not change its 
First Amendment analysis because the association was ""functioning as the creator and disseminator of content,"" not as a 
regulator. 658 F.3d at 622-24."
1805,8," In its reply brief, the NCAA cites Washington v. Nat'l Football League, 880 F. Supp. 2d 1004, 1008 (D. Minn. 2012), to argue 
that any dispute between the NCAA and the student-athletes regarding profits from game rebroadcasts is a dispute over 
performance ownership rights and, thus, ""is a royalties issue, not an antitrust issue."" This statement, however, is only partially 
true. While some student-athletes may be entitled to recover royalties from the NCAA based on their appearances  [**40] in 
certain game re-broadcasts, those royalty claims would not preclude student-athletes from challenging the alleged price-fixing "
1806,," plan that excluded them from the group licensing market in the first place. Whatever individual harms might be redressed 
through royalties claims, antitrust law remains a vehicle for challenging harms to competition more broadly."
1806,9," See, e.g., Gionfriddo v. Major League Baseball, 94 Cal. App. 4th 400, 114 Cal. Rptr. 2d 307 (2001) (holding that professional 
baseball league's use of retired players' ""names, voices, signatures, photographs and/or likenesses"" in websites and video clips 
was protected under the First Amendment); Montana v. San Jose Mercury News, Inc., 34 Cal. App. 4th 790, 794, 40 Cal. Rptr. 
2d 639 (1995) (holding that ""full page newspaper accounts of Super Bowls XXIII and XXIV"" featuring photographs of the 49ers' 
star quarterback, Joe Montana, were ""entitled to First Amendment protection""); Dora v. Frontline Video, Inc., 15 Cal. App. 4th 
536, 18 Cal. Rptr. 2d 790 (1993) (holding that a documentary featuring audio interview, photographs, and video clips of a retired 
surfer was constitutionally protected). "
1807,10," This is not to suggest that any individual student-athlete would be able to prevent a broadcaster from televising his team's 
games merely by withholding his consent. To create a group licensing market such as the one that Plaintiffs have identified, 
individual student-athletes would have to transfer their rights of publicity to some representative entity — such as their school or 
conference — as a condition of their participation in Division I athletics so that the representative entity could license the right to 
televise their games. Thus, broadcasters would obtain group licenses to use every participating student-athlete's name, image, 
and likeness as part of the general licenses they would acquire from every school or conference whose games they wished to 
broadcast. "
1808,11," The NCAA cites only one Minnesota case, Lake v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 582 N.W.2d 231, 235-36 (Minn. 1998), which does 
 [**49] not include any discussion of athletes' publicity rights. Moreover, the NCAA only cited this case in a footnote to an 
improperly filed appendix to its brief."
1808,12," See Zacchini, 433 U.S. at 571 (noting that the tort of invasion of privacy is an ""entirely different tort from the 'right of publicity'"" 
under Ohio state law). "
1809,13," Plaintiffs move to strike Dr. Dennis's report (and any portions of Dr. Rubinfeld's rebuttal report which rely on it) because the 
NCAA failed to make timely expert disclosures under Rule 26(a). Because this Rule 26 violation was ultimately harmless, 
Plaintiffs' motion is denied. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1) (providing that a Rule 26 violation should not result in the exclusion of 
evidence if the violation was harmless). Plaintiffs not only deposed Dr. Dennis but also submitted their own expert report 
criticizing his survey results. Accordingly, they will not be prejudiced by the admission of this evidence. "
1810,14," The Court notes that both parties have failed to submit any meaningful statistical analyses of competitive balance here. 
 [**59] Statisticians and sports economists have developed numerous methods for measuring competitive balance among sports 
teams. See generally Rodney Fort, ""Competitive Balance in North American Professional Sports,"" in Handbook of Sports 
Economics Research 190, 194 (John Fizel ed., 2006) (noting that there are ""many measures [of competitive balance] to choose 
from""). Given the wealth of publicly available historical data regarding Division I teams' win-loss records, national rankings, 
recruiting class quality, box scores (which document game-by-game point differentials), and betting lines, the parties could have 
used any number of methods to examine competitive balance among Division I teams and to evaluate its impact on consumer 
demand. While no method for measuring competitive balance is perfect, almost any statistically based measure would have 
been superior to the collection of selectively culled facts, figures, and non-expert opinions that the parties rely on here. "
1812,15," The Ninth Circuit has questioned whether Topco would preclude an antitrust defendant from justifying a challenged restraint 
with evidence that the restraint enhances competition in a ""closely related"" market. Paladin Associates, Inc. v. Montana Power 
Co., 328 F.3d 1145, 1157 (9th Cir. 2003) (""[P]erhaps that language from Topco is not controlling because it is a dictum or 
incomplete or obsolete or because the case of such closely related markets as those for transport of natural gas and the natural 
gas itself might be distinguished. In any event, we need not and do not reach this issue on the permissible bounds of rule of 
reason inquiry.""). Nevertheless, it has never expressly distinguished Topco on this ground and, even if it had, the NCAA has not 
presented any evidence here to suggest that the market for Division I football and basketball  [**67] is ""closely related"" to the 
market for women's sports or less prominent men's sports. "
1813,16," Defendants had previously sought to challenge Plaintiffs' new theory in a joint motion to strike the motion for class certification. 
See Docket No. 639. The Court denied the motion to strike in January 2013. Docket No. 673. "
1814,17," What's more, Plaintiffs cited Messner without discussion in a footnote listing other out-of-circuit precedents. The other two 
cases Plaintiffs cite here — Butler and In re CRT Antitrust Litig. — were decided after class certification briefing was completed 
but Plaintiffs did not submit a statement of recent decision concerning either of them. "
1823,1," In  [**3] a fourth action, forty-nine States and certain U.S. Territories settled litigation against three of the five publishers."
1823,2," The class action, which has been certified, represents consumers in jurisdictions other than the litigating States. See In re Elec. 
Books Antitrust Litig., 11 MD 2293 (DLC), 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 42537, 2014 WL 1282293 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 28, 2014). "
1825,3, Sections 1 to 7 are addressed to contracts and trusts in restraint of trade. See 15 U.S.C. §§ 1-3. 
1829,4," It is also not true, as Apple contends, that the injured parties are the sole ""real parties in interest"" and that this action is 
indistinguishable from a class action. As explained above, the States are suing not merely to vindicate the rights of their injured 
citizens, but also for relief from the injury to their quasi-sovereign interests in the welfare of their economies. "
1836,1," Per se rules of antitrust liability apply to conduct deemed by the courts to be conclusively anticompetitive and, therefore, 
unlawful. Per se rules eliminate the need to consider the reasonableness of the conduct at issue. Leegin Creative Leather 
Prods., Inc. v. PSKS, Inc., 551 U.S. 877, 886, 127 S. Ct. 2705, 168 L. Ed. 2d 623 (2007). "
1837,2, Desotech based Count VI of its complaint on alleged false statements by 3DS. 
1838,3," For purposes of summary judgment, the parties agreed that 3DS is the sole supplier of SL machines in the United States. They 
also agreed that, as far as SL machines are concerned,  [**12] the United States is the relevant geographic market. "
1839,4," DOJ filed a Competitive Impact Statement in 2001 during a challenge to 3DS's acquisition of another rapid-prototyping 
company. The document states that SL and laser sintering technology were in direct competition with one another at that time. 
Competitive Impact Statement, United States v. 3D Systems Corp., No. 1:01-cv-01237 (D.D.C. May 1, 2002) (No. 7), available at 
http://www.justice.gov/atr/cases/f9000/9019.htm "
1842,5," If competition exists in a primary market (e.g., rapid-prototyping machines) and a manufacturer treats its customers poorly in 
the aftermarket (e.g., resin), the manufacturer presumably will lose new sales of machines as well as lose some existing 
customers in the resin aftermarket. If the manufacturer wishes to stay in business, it will not bite the hand that feeds it for very 
long. SMS Sys. Maint. Servs., 188 F.3d at 16-17 (citations omitted). Unless something exists that prevents market forces from 
operating this way, the antitrust laws are not concerned because market forces on their own will correct the anticompetitive 
conduct. "
1843,6," The Viper Pro machines purchased by the seven customers prior to August 2007 came equipped with RFID technology. 3DS 
had not activated the RFID, however, at the time of sale. 3DS began activating the RFID lockout in mid 2007 by way of a 
software update for the Viper Pro machines. According to Desotech's expert, there was a general market awareness by August 
2007 of the impending RFID activation. 3DS began selling its iPro machines in 2008, with the RFID lockout activated at the time 
of sale. "
1846,7," Because separate grounds for summary judgment exist, we need not reach the parties' dispute about the ongoing nature of the 
conduct. "
1848,1," Technically there are two Plaintiffs, The Valspar Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary, Valspar Sourcing, Inc. Following 
the parties' lead, the Court refers to them jointly with the singular ""Valspar."""
1848,2," Also named as Defendants in this action are Kronos Worldwide, Inc. (""Kronos"") and Millennium Inorganic Chemicals, Inc., now 
known as Cristal USA Inc. (""Cristal""); they have separately moved to dismiss claims for violation of Minnesota Statutes § 
325D.49 (Count II) and for unjust enrichment (Count III). After their Motions were filed, however, Valspar agreed to voluntarily 
dismiss these claims, leaving only the federal antitrust claim for resolution. (See Doc. Nos. 72, 79.) Hence, these Motions will be 
denied as moot."
1848,3," DuPont and Huntsman also have moved to dismiss based on the forum-selection clauses. But for reasons previously stated, 
the Court believes transfer (not dismissal) is the appropriate way to enforce those clauses. (See Doc. No. 92 at 1-2.) "
1849,4," A court faced with a motion to transfer also must determine ""whether the action might have been brought in the proposed 
transferee district."" Austin v. Nestle USA, Inc., 677 F. Supp. 2d 1134, 1136 (D. Minn. 2009) (Kyle, J.) (citation omitted). Here, it is 
undisputed the claims against DuPont and Huntsman ""might have been brought"" in the proposed transferee districts. "
1850,5," A ""minuend"" is a number from which another number (known as the ""subtrahend"") is subtracted. http://www.merriam-
webster.com/dictionary/minuend (last visited April 21, 2014). Here, Valspar's alleged damages equal the allegedly ""inflated"" 
price it agreed to pay for titanium dioxide (the minuend) minus the amount it would have paid absent the alleged ""conspiracy"" 
(the subtrahend). See, e.g., City of Pittsburgh v. W. Penn Power Co., 147 F.3d 256, 268 n.20 (3rd Cir. 1998) (""The proper 
measure of damages for a price-fixing  [**11] violation under the Sherman Act is the difference between the prices actually paid 
and those that would have been paid absent the conspiracy.""). "
1851,6," The action was certified as a class and later settled, but Valspar opted out of the settlement."
1851,7," Valspar relies upon Imation Corp. v. Quantum Corp., Civ. No. 01-1798, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4034, 2002 WL 385550 (D. 
Minn. Mar. 8, 2002) (Kyle, J.), Terra International, Inc. v. Mississippi Chemical Corp., 119 F.3d 688 (8th Cir. 1997), and In re 
Wholesale Grocery Products Antitrust Litigation, 707 F.3d 917 (8th Cir. 2013), but those cases do not aid its cause. Terra 
actually affirmed the district court's decision to enforce a contractual forum-selection clause even though the plaintiff had alleged 
tort claims. See 119 F.3d at 694-95. And in Imation and Wholesale Grocery Products, unlike here, the agreements in question 
did not set the price for the plaintiffs' purchases and thus were unrelated to the plaintiffs' claims. "
1873,1," Alexander Defendants note that CCT was not a party to the Alexander Contract. (MTD 9 n.3, ECF No. 15-1.) Because Plaintiffs 
attached the Alexander Contract as Exhibit 3 to their Complaint, the Court may properly consider it in ruling on this MTD. See 
Coto Settlement v. Eisenberg, 593 F.3d 1031, 1038 (9th Cir. 2010) (citations omitted). On its face, the Alexander Contract is only 
between Alexander Defendants and Promark. Accordingly, the MTD is GRANTED WITHOUT PREJUDICE for this claim as to 
CCT. "
1875,2," ""In short, California does not follow the Restatement's strict requirement that some document must actually represent the 
owner's intangible property right. On the contrary, courts routinely apply the tort [of conversion] to intangibles without inquiring 
whether they are merged in a document."" Kremen v. Cohen, 337 F.3d 1024, 1033 (9th Cir. 2002) (explaining that California 
jurisprudence ""recognizes conversion of music recordings, radio shows, customer lists, regulatory filings, confidential information 
and even domain names""). "
1888,1," The Court has already granted Plaintiffs' RJN. (See Order 8-9, ECF No. 78.) "
1889,2," Macy's does not seek to dismiss this seventeenth claim, and accordingly this Order does not address it. "
1890,3," The parties address these claims in a haphazard order in their briefs, but the Court will address the claims in the order in which 
they appear in the Complaint."
1890,4," Macy's notes that CCT was not a party to the Alexander Contract. (MTD 12 n.5, ECF No. 19-1.) Because Plaintiffs attached the 
Purchase Order to their Complaint, the Court may properly consider it in ruling on this MTD. See Coto Settlement v. Eisenberg, 
593 F.3d 1031, 1038 (9th Cir. 2010) (citations omitted). On its face, the Purchase Order is only between Macy's and Promark. 
Accordingly, the MTD is GRANTED WITHOUT PREJUDICE for this claim as to CCT. "
1892,5," ""In short, HN15[

1893,," California jurisprudence ""recognizes conversion of music recordings, radio shows, customer lists, regulatory filings, confidential 
information and even domain names""). "
1896,6," Contrary to Macy's arguments (see MTD 23, ECF No. 19-1; Reply 9, ECF No. 42), the Court has already explained with 
regards to Plaintiffs' claim for conversion that ""a Rule 12(b)(6) motion will not be granted merely because a plaintiff requests a 
remedy to which he or she is not entitled."" Summit Tech., 933 F. Supp. at 927-28 (citation, alteration, and internal quotation 
marks omitted). "
1901,1," EPS does not seek to dismiss this seventeenth claim, and accordingly this Order does not address it. "
1902,2," ""In short, California does not follow the Restatement's strict requirement that some document must actually represent the 
owner's intangible property right. On the contrary, courts routinely apply the tort [of conversion] to intangibles without inquiring 
whether they are merged in a document."" Kremen v. Cohen, 337 F.3d 1024, 1033 (9th Cir. 2002) (explaining that California 
jurisprudence ""recognizes conversion of music recordings,  [**12] radio shows, customer lists, regulatory filings, confidential 
information and even domain names""). "
1906,3," EPS argues that ""the plaintiff in a UCL action must be either a consumer or a competitor of the defendant."" (MTD 15, ECF No. 
 [**24] 66-1.) Yet, EPS is mistaken. The class of persons who may bring claims under the UCL is broader than EPS asserts. 
Indeed, any ""person who has suffered injury in fact and has lost money or property as a result of the unfair competition"" has 
standing to pursue a UCL claim. Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 17204; see Rubio v. Capital One Bank, 613 F.3d 1195, 1204 (9th Cir. 
2009) (finding that credit card holder had standing to assert UCL claim against credit card issuer); Clayworth v. Pfizer, Inc., 49 
Cal. 4th 758, 111 Cal. Rptr. 3d 666, 233 P.3d 1066, 1087 (Cal. 2010) (finding that pharmacies, having ""had business dealings 
with"" pharmaceutical companies, had standing to assert UCL claim)."
1906,4," As the Court has already explained with regards to Plaintiffs' requests for punitive damages and their claim for conversion, ""a 
Rule 12(b)(6) motion will not be granted merely because a plaintiff requests a remedy to which he or she is not entitled."" Summit 
Tech., 933 F. Supp. at 927-28 (citation, alteration,  [**27] and internal quotation marks omitted). Hence, EPS's argument that 
Plaintiffs' claim fails because it seeks unrecoverable remedies fails. (See MTD 16, ECF No. 66-1; Reply 8-9, ECF No. 75.) "
1909,1," The Court has already granted Plaintiffs' RJN. (See Order 8-9, ECF No. 78.) "
1910,2," Whirlpool does not seek to dismiss this seventeenth claim, and accordingly this Order does not address it. "
1912,3," Courts have routinely entertained claims for both trademark infringement and common law unfair competition, implying that the 
two causes of action  [*15] are not mutually exclusive, particularly at the pleading stage. See, e.g., Hokto Kinoko, 810 F. Supp. 
2d 1013; Wecosign, Inc. v. IFG Holdings, Inc., 845 F. Supp. 2d 1072, 1079 (C.D. Cal. 2012) (""[T]he Ninth Circuit 'has 
consistently held that state common law claims of unfair competition and actions pursuant to California Business and 
Professions Code § 17200 are ""substantially congruent"" to claims under the Lanham Act.' . . . Therefore, the Court jointly 
analyzes Plaintiff's trademark infringement, false designation of origin, state statutory unfair competition, and state common law 
unfair competition claims.""); Moroccanoil, Inc. v. Allstate Beauty Prods., Inc., 847 F. Supp. 2d 1197 (C.D. Cal. 2012); Vallavista 
Corp. v. Amazon.com, Inc., 657 F. Supp. 2d 1132 (N.D. Cal. 2008); Microsoft Corp. v. Nop, 549 F. Supp. 2d 1233 (E.D. Cal. 
2007); Area 55, Inc. v. Pandamerican LLC, No. 10-CV-269-H (NLS), 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 99247, 2010 WL 3564715 (S.D. Cal. 
Sept. 10, 2010); Mallard Creek Indus., Inc. v. Morgan, 56 Cal. App. 4th 426, 65 Cal. Rptr. 2d 461 (1997). "
1919,1," Defendants do not seek to dismiss this seventeenth claim, and accordingly this Order does not address it."
1919,2," Plaintiffs concede in their Oppositions that many of their claims against Defendants are premised on the alter ego doctrine. It 
appears that Plaintiffs' breach of contract, conversion (as to O'Donnell), trademark infringement, false designation of origin, 
trademark dilution, and common law unfair competition claims are premised solely on alter ego liability. (See generally Opp'ns, 
ECF Nos. 69, 70.) "
1922,3," Defendants also claim that Plaintiffs' request for purportedly unavailable remedies also mandates dismissal of the claim. 
(Dummler MTD 24, ECF No. 65-1; O'Donnell MTD 24, ECF No. 68-1.) Because ""a Rule 12(b)(6) motion will not be granted "
1923,," merely because a plaintiff requests a remedy to which he or she is not entitled,"" however, the Court disregards this argument. 
Summit Tech., 933 F. Supp. at 927-28 (citation, alteration, and internal quotation marks omitted). "
1929,1," LEC does not seek to dismiss this seventeenth claim, and accordingly this Order does not address it. "
1932,2," LEC argues that Plaintiffs cannot establish their ownership in/right to possession of the CCT Assets because Plaintiffs' claim for 
declaratory relief ""admits"" that the ownership of the CCT Assets is disputed. (Reply 10, ECF No.  [*19] 75-3.) Not only is this 
argument nonsensical—Plaintiffs, after all, assert that they have ""full and exclusive right to possession of all of the CCT Assets,"" 
and merely ask that the Court officially declare said possessory interest (see Compl. ¶ 189, ECF No. 1)—but, regardless, claims 
for conversion and declaratory relief are not mutually exclusive. See, e.g., Lincoln Gen. Ins. Co. v. Tri Cntys. Bank, No. CIV. S-
10-1442 FCD/EFB, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 82627, 2010 WL 3069874, (E.D. Cal. Aug. 5, 2010) (denying defendant's motion to 
dismiss as to both conversion and declaratory relief claims). "
1933,3," In its Reply, LEC also argues that this claim fails because Plaintiffs claim an interference  [*20] with intangible property, but 
conversion can only concern tangible property. (Reply 9-10, ECF No. 75-3.) The Court disagrees for two reasons. First, many of 
the CCT Assets are in fact tangible property, including the actual footage of GACT. (See Compl. ¶ 75, ECF No. 1 (defining the 
CCT Assets as, inter alia, ""the raw tapes, post-produced products, and other production assets of the episodes that had been 
taped as well as the personal property of [Plaintiffs] that was used or intended to be used in the production of the Tour and TV 
Show, including . . . sets, set decorations, equipment, appliances, [and] hardware"").) But, even if Plaintiffs' claim concerned 
solely intangible property, that fact alone would not bar the claim. The authority on which LEC relies in asserting its argument is 
outdated, as the Ninth Circuit has since explicitly held that intangible property can be subject to a conversion claim. See Kremen 
v. Cohen, 337 F.3d 1024, 1033 (9th Cir. 2002) (""In short, California does not follow the Restatement's strict requirement that 
some document must actually represent the owner's intangible property right. On the contrary, courts routinely apply the tort [of 
conversion] to  [*21] intangibles without inquiring whether they are merged in a document.""). "
1936,4," LEC also claims that Plaintiffs' request for purportedly unavailable remedies mandates dismissal of the claim. (MTD 22, ECF 
No. 67-1.) Because ""a Rule 12(b)(6) motion will not be granted merely because a plaintiff requests a remedy to which he or she 
is not entitled,"" however, the Court disregards this argument. Summit Tech., 933 F. Supp. at 927-28 (citation, alteration, and 
internal quotation marks omitted). "

1977,*, * JUSTICE Scalia joins this opinion [****6]  except as to footnotes 1-3.
1977,1," This provision did “not contemplat[e] [****7]  that the recovery of attorney’s fees [would] become an ordinary thing in patent 
suits . . . .” S. Rep. No. 79-1503, p. 2 (1946)."
1977,2," The Senate Report similarly explained that the new provision was “substantially the same as” § 70, and that the “‘exceptional

interpreted by the courts.” S. Rep. No. 82-1979, p. 30 (1952)."
1977,3," See Brief for Petitioner 35 (“[T]his amendment was not intended to create a stricter standard for fee awards, but instead was

in’ § 70”). "
1978,4," In Kilopass Technology, Inc. v. Sidense Corp., 738 F.3d 1302 (CA Fed. 2013) decided after our grant of certiorari but before we 
heard oral argument in this case—the Federal Circuit appeared to cut back on the “subjective bad faith” inquiry, holding that the 
language in iLOR  was dictum and that “actual knowledge of baselessness is not required.” 738 F.3d, at 1310. Rather, the court 
held, “a defendant need only prove reckless conduct to satisfy the subjective component of the § 285 analysis,” ibid., and courts 
may “dra[w] an inference of bad faith from circumstantial evidence thereof when a patentee pursues claims that are devoid of 
merit,” id., at 1311. Most importantly, the Federal Circuit stated that “[o]bjective baselessness alone can create a sufficient 
inference of bad faith to establish exceptionality under § 285, unless the circumstances as a whole show a lack of [****11]  
recklessness on the patentee’s part.” Id., at 1314. Chief Judge Rader wrote a concurring opinion that sharply criticized, 738 
F.3d, at 1318-1320; the court, he said, “should have remained true to its original reading of” § 285, id., at 1320. "

executive responded as follows: “‘Yes—old patent we had for a long time that was sitting on the shelf. They are just looking for 
royalties.’” Ibid. The District Court wrote that “in the light most favorable to Octane, these remarks are stray comments by 
employees with no demonstrated connection to the lawsuit.”  Ibid. "
1980,6," In Fogerty v. Fantasy, Inc., 510 U.S. 517, 114 S. Ct. 1023, 127 L. Ed. 2d 455 (1994), for example, we explained that HN7[
] LEdHN[7][
] [7] in determining whether to award fees under a similar provision in the Copyright Act, district courts could 
consider a “nonexclusive” list of “factors,” including “frivolousness, motivation, objective unreasonableness (both in the factual 
and legal components of the case) and the need in particular circumstances to advance considerations of compensation and 
deterrence.” Id., at 534, n. 19, 114 S. Ct. 1023, 127 L. Ed. 2d 455 (internal quotation marks omitted). "
1988,1," The trial court's ultimate judgment that the Public Work Statute did not apply to this transaction rested primarily on three 
conclusions: (1) a private entity—Foundation—was the title holder of the Building at the time of the Building renovations; (2) 
Foundation was the signatory on the construction agreement with ICI; and (3) payment to ICI, though originating [**8]  with 
School Corporation, was made from Foundation's bank account. See App. at 26, 27 (Conclusions of Law 13, 14, 23, 24)."
1988,2," As a threshold matter the Court of Appeals addressed Foundation's contention that Taxpayers' claims were moot because the 
renovation project had been completed and because no effective [**9]  relief could be granted due to taxpayers' failure to join ICI 
as a party defendant. The Court disagreed and addressed the parties' contentions on the merits. Foundation again raises its 
mootness claim on transfer. "
1989,3," We also summarily affirm the Court of Appeals opinion in determining Taxpayers' claims are not moot and determining the 
Public Lawsuit Statute applies to this case. See Alva Elec., Inc., 984 N.E.2d at 676-78."

control."" Oil Supply Co., v. Hires Parts Serv., Inc., 726 N.E.2d 246, 248 (Ind. 2000)."
1989,5," Taxpayers also raised and briefed the antitrust issue in the Court of Appeals. See Br. of Appellants at 35-37. Thus, upon our 
grant of transfer we obtained jurisdiction over all issues raised below. See Ind. Appellate Rule 58(A)(2). "
1990,6," Because this contention is dispositive we do not address Defendants' contentions that (1) the language of Indiana Code section 
24-1-2-1 exempts them from the reach of the Antitrust Act because each of the six contracts the parties executed here was 
lawful in isolation; and (2) because School Corporation cannot as a matter of law violate Indiana Code section 24-1-2-3, 
Foundation cannot have ""engaged"" with School Corporation to violate the statute. "
1991,7," HN11[
] Where such violation occurs, by operation of law the contracts involved are void. See I.C. 36-1-12-16 HN12[
] (""A 
contract for public work by a political subdivision or agency is void if it is not let in accordance with this chapter.""). This is of little 
moment here, however, as most of the contracts have been fully performed and Taxpayers expressed at Oral Argument they 
have no intention of upsetting the transaction at this point. See Oral Arg. Video Tr. at 44:00-44:45. Taxpayers have thus 
abandoned their request for an injunction against any further expenditure of public funds on the project. "

2014,1," Plaintiff represented himself in the trial court and continues to do so on appeal. In addition to plaintiff, the complaint named 
several classes of plaintiffs, including other tutors, parents and  [*3] students, school districts and taxpayers. The Appellant's 
Opening Brief (AOB) stated that plaintiff was representing himself and all other parties. We rejected the AOB because plaintiff is 
not an attorney. In a Notice of Errata and Corrections, plaintiff removed the offending statement. We address only the issues 
relating to whether the complaint states a cause of action on plaintiff's behalf, not whether it states a cause of action on behalf of 
any other purported class."

Carl Cohn, Aida Molina, James Ramos, Patricia Rucker, Ilene Straus."
2014,3," The complaint also included causes of action captioned ""Conspiracy"" (the fifth cause of action) and ""Declaratory Relief"" (the 
sixth cause of action). Conspiracy is a basis for liability for a civil wrong but is not a cause of action. (Faunce v. Cate (2013) 222 
Cal.App.4th 166, 173, 166 Cal. Rptr. 3d 61.) Similarly,  [*4] declaratory relief is an equitable remedy, not a cause of action. 
(Ibid.) Because the declaratory relief and conspiracy claims in this case were derivative of other causes of action as to which we 
find the trial court properly sustained defendants' demurrer, we conclude defendants' demurrer to the so-called conspiracy and 
declaratory relief causes of action was also properly sustained. "
2017,4," Exhibit A, a letter dated April 13, 2010, states that plaintiff's March 2010 application was incomplete because it ""[d]id not submit 
sufficient supporting documentation, e.g., lack of proof of being legally constituted and qualified to do business in California 
and/or being fiscally sound to operate as a provider."" In a letter dated May 26, 2010, the Department of Education provided 
plaintiff with ""a copy of the screening checklist"" for plaintiff's March 2010 application. According to the checklist, plaintiff's 
application omitted: (1) three letters of reference from previous clients; (2) evidence that plaintiff was legally constituted and 
qualified to do business in California; (3) evidence that plaintiff was ""fiscally sound,"" including proof of financial resources to 
operate as an SES provider for six months, proof of financial viability, and organizational budgets identifying all sources of 
revenue. Exhibit B, a letter dated April 18, 2011, states that plaintiff's March 2011 application was incomplete for the same 
reason his 2010 application  [*16] had been found incomplete, plus two additional reasons: (1) the application did not address 
four required elements in the narrative; (2) the application did not include a completed Template for Quality Verification of 
Testing Instrument. Plaintiff argues the trial court erred in its construction of the exhibits attached to the complaint. The trial court's interpretation is 
not binding on us in reviewing a demurrer. We consider the exhibits in light of the rule that facts set forth in exhibits attached to a 
complaint are accepted as true and given precedence over contrary allegations in the pleading. (Dodd v. Citizens Bank of Costa 
Mesa (1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 1624, 1627, 272 Cal. Rptr. 623.) "
2018,5," There is no allegation that the Board failed to abide by the procedural requirements set forth in the Government Code for 
adopting rules and regulations to implement state statutes. "
2021,6," Parratt was overruled on unrelated ground in Daniels v. Williams (1986) 474 U.S. 327, 330-331, 106 S. Ct. 662, 88 L. Ed. 2d 
662. "
2022,7," Plaintiff alleges in his first amended complaint that the relevant parts of the Administrative Code are ""underground regulations"" 
and hence invalid. (California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform v. Bonta (2003) 106 Cal. App. 4th 498, 506, 130 Cal. Rptr. 
2d 823.) On appeal, plaintiff does not develop that argument and we deem it waived. (Paterno v. State of California (1999) 74 
Cal.App.4th 68, 106, 87 Cal. Rptr. 2d 754.) "
2037,1," Also before the Court is HannStar's administrative motion to strike Best Buy's reply brief. MDL Dkt. No. 8903. Because the 
Court does not rely on Best Buy's reply brief in this Order, HannStar's motion to strike is DENIED AS MOOT. "
