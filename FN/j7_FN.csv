25,1," Though not expressly alleged, the Court infers that the named Plaintiffs are residents of Kentucky and Iowa respectively. "
26,2," Although not expressly alleged, it does not appear that the OEMs pay for the applications. In other words, the Google Apps are 
free to pre-load, subject to the conditions in the MADAs. "
28,3," As addressed below, the Court finds that the Cartwright Act claim must be dismissed without leave to amend. "
29,4," Though granted leave to amend, the Lorenzo plaintiff did not renew his federal antitrust (Clayton Act) claim in the subsequent 
pleading. See Lorenzo v. Qualcomm Inc., No. 08cv2124 WQH(LSP), 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 69843, 2009 WL 2448375, at *2 
(S.D. Cal. Aug. 10, 2009)."
29,5," Similarly, because directness is a factor to consider under AGC for purposes of standing for damages, Plaintiffs must also 
sufficiently allege directness of injury to the extent they intend to pursue a Clayton Act § 4 remedy. See AGC, 459 U.S. at 543-
44; Am. Ad Mgmt., 190 F.3d at 1055."
29,6," To the extent Plaintiffs are the means by which Defendant improves its search engine algorithm and search product, Plaintiffs' 
relationship to Google search as the unwitting consumer is not an ""injury"" within the meaning of the antitrust laws. "
30,7," For purposes of this motion, Defendant has elected not to challenge Plaintiffs' allegations of the relevant market and of its 
market power in those relevant markets. Def.'s Mot. 17 n.11. As such, the parties' briefing (and this Court's order) focuses on the 
sufficiency of the allegations with respect to [**24]  Defendant's exclusionary conduct, and not with respect to any other 
elements of Plaintiffs' § 2 claims for monopolization and attempted monopolization. The Court notes only that the analysis of 
attempted monopolization is ""wholly independent"" from the analysis of monopoly maintenance. Microsoft, 253 F.3d at 81. To the 
extent Defendant does not challenge Plaintiffs' allegations of its market power, see FAC ¶¶ 19-27 (alleging more than 80% share "
31,," of the relevant markets), the claim of ""attempted monopolization"" would appear superfluous—if not paradoxical—in the face of 
those allegations."
31,8," It is not clear that there are any pleading differences between exclusive dealing under § 1 and § 2 with respect to the degree of 
market foreclosure, and the parties' briefing does not suggest that they believe there is a difference. For purposes of this motion, 
the Court assumes that at the pleading stage, the degree of market foreclosure required to make out an exclusive dealing claim 
does not differ under § 1 and § 2. Compare Microsoft, 253 F.3d 34, 70, 346 U.S. App. D.C. 330 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (""[A] 
monopolist's use of exclusive contracts, in certain circumstances, may give rise to a § 2 violation even though the contracts 
foreclose less than the roughly 40% or 50% share usually required in order to establish [**25]  a § 1 violation."") to Eastman 
Kodak Co. v. Image Tech. Servs., Inc., 504 U.S. 451, 481, 112 S. Ct. 2072, 119 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1992) (describing the § 2 
standard as ""the more stringent monopoly standard""); see generally Areeda & Hovenkamp, Fundamentals of Antitrust Law § 
18.01 (4th ed. 2014) (""As a legal matter, § 2 requires that the defendant have either monopoly power or a dangerous probability 
of achieving it, but when such power is established may find illegality on lower percentages than the § 1 law of exclusive dealing 
requires. By contrast, § 1 is sometimes applied to nondominant defendants and where a 'dangerous probability' of monopoly is 
not in prospect, but in such cases assesses somewhat higher foreclosure requirements.""). "
32,9," At a higher level of abstraction, this means that those competitors who cannot access users are unable to improve their search 
algorithms, thereby impairing their ability to compete with Defendant on the merits of their respective search products. See FAC 
¶¶ 59-60. This is akin to the theory of Sherman Act § 2 monopoly maintenance described in Microsoft, 253 F.3d at 60-62, 
wherein Microsoft's exclusive licensing terms prevented OEMs from promoting rival Internet browsers, thereby reducing rival 
browser usage and developer interest in those browsers, with the effect of maintaining developer focus on developing for 
Microsoft's Windows operating system, which contributed to maintaining Microsoft's monopoly over the market for operating 
systems. Whether this theory is viable under § 1 is unclear."
32,10," Plaintiffs attempt to further atomize the relevant market into not just handheld search, but handheld search on non-Apple 
devices. That is not the relevant market that Plaintiffs have alleged for § 1 purposes, although the Court acknowledges that 
Defendant's conduct with respect to Apple devices may be relevant to a § 2 analysis."
32,11," Should Plaintiffs successfully amend to allege cognizable antitrust injury, they would also need to demonstrate other factors in 
support of standing to pursue monetary relief (to the extent they do intend to seek damages under § 4 of the Clayton Act). The 
Court assumes that Plaintiffs are familiar with the AGC factors for § 4 standing, as further elaborated in American Ad 
Management. See AGC, 459 U.S. at 536-46; Am. Ad Mgmt., 190 F.3d at 1055; see also Cargill, 479 U.S. at 110 n.5 (""A showing 
of antitrust injury is necessary, but not always sufficient, to establish standing under § 4, because a party may have suffered 
antitrust injury but may not be a proper plaintiff under § 4 for other reasons.""). Plaintiffs are also encouraged to clearly indicate in 
their amended pleading whether they are in fact seeking § 4 relief. "
42,1," Under the standard of review applicable to demurrers, which we discuss post, our recitation of the facts is based on the 
allegations of the complaint, which we accept as true. "
43,2," By federal statute, which we detail in part 2 of our Discussion, cable service is divided into three parts: (1) a basic service tier of 
local commercial stations and public access channels that may be supplemented with additional cable channels; (2) cable 
programming services offered in tiers or groups, for which a separate rate is charged; and (3) video programming offered on a 
per-channel or per-program basis. (Time Warner Entertainment Co., L.P. v. F.C.C. (D.C. Cir. 1995) 312 U.S. App.D.C. 187 & 
fns. 4–6 [56 F.3d 151, 180 & fns. 4–6],  (dis. opn. of Randolph, J.) (Time Warner); 47 U.S.C. §§ 522(3), (17), 543(a)(2), 
(b)(7)(A)–(B), (c)(1), (c)(2)(D), (l)(2).) Time Warner's cable lineup, which the trial court judicially noticed, lists the three disputed 
sports channels as part of its basic lineup. We assume that the reference in the complaint to an “enhanced basic tier” means that 
Time Warner added those and other channels to its basic service tier, as allowed by the federal cable act."
43,3," We will refer to the four individual plaintiffs collectively as appellants. We will sometimes refer to Time Warner, the Dodgers and 
Lakers collectively as respondents."
43,4, The parties raised other issues in their demurrers that are not relevant on appeal. 
44,5," Perhaps in recognition of this rule, appellants do not contend that we may not consider the express regulatory preemption issue 
that was first raised by the trial court. "
45,6, All further section references are to title 47 of the United States Code.
45,7," When a cable provider is subject to “effective competition,” its rates are unregulated. (§ 543(a)(1), (2).) Section 543 establishes 
three separate market share formulas to determine whether effective competition exists. (§ 543(l)(1); Time Warner, supra, 56 
F.3d at p. 162.) If a cable provider is not subject to effective competition then the FCC regulates its rates according to a complex 
set of statutory and regulatory standards. (Time Warner, at pp. 162–163; § 543(c)(2); 47 C.F.R. § 76.922 (2014).) The parties do not specifically address whether Time Warner is subject to effective competition and therefore exempt from rate 
regulation. However, while the complaint alleges that Time Warner is either a significant or primary cable provider in the affected 
areas, it also alleges the existence of alternate providers and does not state that Time Warner is not subject to effective 
competition. In its trial court points and authorities, Time Warner cited [***11]  section 543(a) for the proposition that it had 
“complete discretion” to set its own rates, while appellants said they were not asking the court to regulate rates and instead 
wanted them determined by “market forces.” We take from this that Time Warner is subject to effective competition under the 
Cable Act and that its rates are therefore unregulated, a fact that appellants' counsel confirmed during oral argument."
45,8," Section 543(f) states: HN8[
] “A cable operator shall not charge a subscriber for any service or equipment that the subscriber 
has not affirmatively requested by name. For purposes of this subsection, a subscriber's failure to refuse a cable operator's 
proposal to provide such service or equipment shall not be deemed to be an affirmative request for such service or equipment.”"
45,9," The manner in which Time Warner effected its decision to add the Dodgers and Lakers channels unilaterally is an example of 
negative option billing as subscribers were not asked to affirmatively request or agree to the additional channels."
45,10," The regulation states: “(a) HN10[
] A cable operator shall not charge a subscriber for any service or equipment that the 
subscriber has not affirmatively requested by name. A subscriber's failure to refuse a cable operator's proposal to provide such 
service or equipment is not an affirmative request for service or equipment. A subscriber's affirmative request for service or 
equipment may be made orally or in [***13]  writing. “(b) The requirements of paragraph (a) of this section shall not preclude the adjustment of rates to reflect inflation, cost of living 
and other external costs, the addition or deletion of a specific program from a service offering, the addition or deletion of specific "
46,," channels from an existing tier or service, the restructuring or division of existing tiers of service, or the adjustment of rates as a 
result of the addition, deletion or substitution of channels pursuant to § 76.922, provided that such changes do not constitute a 
fundamental change in the nature of an existing service or tier of service and are otherwise consistent with applicable 
regulations. “(c) State and local governments may not enforce state and local consumer protection laws that conflict with or undermine 
paragraph (a) or (b) of this section or any other sections of this Subpart that were established pursuant to Section 3 of the 1992 
Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. 543.” (47 C.F.R. § 76.981 (2014).)"
46,11, All further references to “Regulations” are to title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations (2014).
46,12," The Cable Act itself contains several statutes relating to preemption. Section 556(c) provides generally that any provision of 
state law “which is inconsistent with this chapter shall be deemed to be preempted and superseded.” Section 552(d)(1) states, 
“Nothing in this subchapter [***14]  shall be construed to prohibit any State or any franchising authority from enacting or 
enforcing any consumer protection law, to the extent not specifically preempted by this subchapter.” (See § 552(a), (b), § 557.)"
46,13," Regulations part 76.981(c) provides: “State and local governments may not enforce state and local consumer protection laws 
that conflict with or undermine paragraph (a) [(negative option billing)] or (b) [(limiting the prohibition against negative option to 
‘fundamental’ changes)] of this section or any other sections of this Subpart that were established pursuant to Section 3 of the 
1992 Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. 543.” "
47,14," The court in Time Warner, supra, 56 F.3d 151, considered a challenge by cable operators to FCC rulemaking opinions that 
heralded the FCC's interpretation of section 543(c)'s negative option billing provision to permit concurrent enforcement of state 
consumer protection laws unless they impinged on rate regulation. Regulations part 76.981 was never mentioned and the Time 
Warner court held that the issue was not yet ripe for judicial review. (56 F.3d at pp. 194–195.)"
47,15," In the context of the present case, if negative option billing were prohibited in every situation, Time Warner would not be able 
to delete, for example, the Velocity channel (channel 416) or the Oxygen channel (channel 77) from its basic cable lineup 
without affirmative agreement by subscribers to continue basic cable service without those channels. Regulations part 76.981(b) 
permits the cable operator to take such action without affirmative subscriber agreement because the deletion of the channels 
does not constitute a “fundamental change.”"
47,16," The version of section 552(d)(1) printed in the United States Code Annotated states that the statute's express [***20]  
endorsement of the companion use of state consumer protection laws unless otherwise preempted states that “[n]othing in this 
subchapter” prevents their enforcement. Based on this, respondents contend that the provision authorizing state consumer 
actions does not apply to negative option billing practices under section 543(f) because that statute is found in another 
subchapter of the Cable Act. The Doyle court clarified that the use of “subchapter” was essentially a typographical error because 
the Statutes at Large (106 Stat. 1484) uses the word “title” instead of “subchapter,” a conflict that is generally resolved in favor of 
the language used in the Statutes at Large. (Doyle, supra, 66 F.3d at p. 878 & fn. 11.) As a result, consumer protection in "
48,," section 552(d)(1) (formerly found in subsection (c)), applies to the general provisions of the Cable Act as a whole. (66 F.3d at pp. 
878 & fn. 11, 881–882.) "
49,17, We asked for and received supplemental briefing from the parties on this issue.
49,18," We do so keenly aware of how this issue affects millions of our fellow Southern California residents. With apologies to Bruce 
Springsteen, we appreciate the lament of cable television subscribers who feel that although they now receive 10 times 57 
channels or more, mostly nothing is on that they wish to view. We [***26]  simply hold that federal preemption principles bar 
application of state consumer protection laws in this case. Thus, consumers must present their complaints to Congress or the 
FCC. "
52,1," In its Motion to Dismiss, Mercury argues that Heartland's new allegation that Mercury is a merchant acquirer but not a payment 
processor, see 1AC ¶ 15, is a new allegation that ""directly contradicts"" Heartland's original complaint and hence is not 
authorized by this Court's previous order. See Def.'s Mot. Dismiss, Docket No. 67 at [*4]  3. In the original complaint, Heartland 
asserted that ""Mercury, like Heartland, is engaged in the business of payment processing for merchants. Also like Heartland, 
Mercury provides payment services nationwide."" Compl. ¶ 11. Heartland explains that it has since learned new information. In 
the 1AC, Heartland also states that ""Mercury competes directly with Heartland . . . [in] providing payment processing services for 
small and medium-sized merchants. . ."" 1AC ¶ 14. The Court does not find that Heartland has impermissibly changed its 
allegations. "
53,2," In its Motion to Dismiss, Mercury argues that the ISO allegations are new and thus not allowed in Heartland's amended 
complaint. One ISO allegation is that one of the ways in which Mercury misleads merchants is by using the ISOs to make pricing 
statements which Mercury knows to be false. This is not a new allegation, but rather provides more detail as to how Mercury 
communicates misrepresentations to merchants. In addition, Heartland alleges that Mercury is directly deceiving the ISOs. This 
is a new allegation. However, this allegation is closely related to Heartland's main contention that Mercury is engaging in 
deceptive business practices. Thus, in the [*8]  interest of judicial economy, the Court will allow the allegation. "
56,3," Heartland has not, however, plead any facts to support its allegations that Mercury's agents made ""Best Rate"" or ""Rate Match"" 
guarantees. Accordingly, Heartland may not rely on those allegations as evidence of Mercury's deception. "

96,1," The plaintiffs have included numerous pages of Wellmark reimbursement rates in the record. For example, for chiropractic 
services alone, Wellmark has approximately forty-eight different reimbursement rates in a given year, including twenty-one 
different rates for examination of X-rays. It seems implausible that a typical employer would have enough information about the

97,4," The plaintiffs make a passing assertion that Wellmark and the other out-of-state BCBS affiliates have entered into an illegal

100,6," As the court put it in North Jackson Pharmacy, If the required rule of reason inquiry were to reveal that the anticompetitive [**28]  consequences of any such conspiracy 
sufficiently outweigh its procompetitive benefits so that the restraint is ultimately judged unreasonable under Section 1 [of 
the Sherman Act], this Court would not hesitate to rule accordingly. But because no authority even suggests that all 
cooperative purchasing agreements run afoul of Section 1, and because the agreement at issue here is part of a larger and 
potentially procompetitive enterprise, the rule of reason must be applied to North Jackson's Claim I."

state policy or legislative history that would require a different interpretation of the Donnelly Act in [**11]  this case. This Opinion 
thus analyzes the Sherman Act and Donnelly Act claims collectively. "
128,7," Antitrust standing, because it is intertwined with the merits of the antitrust claim, is not jurisdictional in nature but rather relates 
to the merits of a claim addressed through a 12(b)(6), Fed. R. Civ. P., motion to dismiss. See Lerner v. Fleet Bank, N.A., 318 
F.3d 113, 128-29 (2d Cir. 2003) (analogizing RICO's proximate cause standing requirement to antitrust standing and holding that 
it was not jurisdictional); In re Lorazepam & Clorazepate Antitrust Litig., 289 F.3d 98, 107-08, 351 U.S. App. D.C. 223 (D.C. Cir.

statutory fair reporting privilege that applies when a person maliciously institutes a judicial proceeding alleging false and 
defamatory charges, and then circulates a press release or other communication based on the judicial proceeding. Id. Plaintiffs 
suggest that if the Williams exception applies, it would permit tort claims against defendants for statements made in the judicial 
proceedings themselves. Even assuming that the [**28]  Williams exception applies, it is an exception to the statutory fair 
reporting privilege, not the absolute privilege afforded to statements made in judicial proceedings. "

144,2," Defendants contend Plaintiffs' misrepresentations are vague and ambiguous because the contract allegedly changed over the 
course of the nearly two year business relationship. (Mot. at pp. 11-12.) However, Plaintiffs allege that the Contract was orally 
modified ""[i]n about June 2009,"" to reflect an agreed upon change to the method of billing. (FAC at ¶ 16.) Initially, [*22]  charges 
were to be based on hits on approved keyword phrases; after June 2009, they were to be based on a ""per click"" basis. (Id.) 
Defendants further allege that ""[w]ithout Plaintiffs' knowledge or consent, in about July 2010, Defendants returned to keyword 
rather than 'per click' invoicing."" (Id. at ¶ 18.) These allegations are date specific enough to allow Defendants to defend against 
Plaintiffs' allegation of fraud."
144,3," Because Plaintiffs state a cause of action for fraud, the Court also declines to dismiss Plaintiffs' prayer for punitive damages. 
See Cal. Civ. Code § 3294(a); TJRK, Inc. v. Waage, No. 08cv1140, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 86921, 2008 WL 4748179, at *3 (S.D. 
Cal. 2008). "
147,4," ""[T]he determination [of] whether [a practice] is unfair is one of fact which requires a review of the evidence from both parties[,]"" 
and is therefore a determination that cannot typically be made on a motion to dismiss. See McKell, 49 Cal. Rptr. at 240. "
156,1," Paragraph 93 of Value City's Amended Counterclaim states: For example, the Ashley Counterclaim Defendants caused, approved, permitted, authorized, and/or ratified placement of an 
advertisement in November 2011 that offered for sale a particular sofa combined with a ""free loveseat with purchase of 
sofa"" for a total price of $397 and represented that the ""compare"" price was $1,159.98. The advertisement represented that 
the offer was for ""1 DAY — FRIDAY ONLY"" and that there were ""ONLY 100 SETS TO SELL"" and ""limit [*21]  1 per 
household."" In January 2012, the Ashley Counterclaim Defendants caused, approved, permitted, authorized, and/or ratified 
placement of an advertisement offering for sale the same sofa with the same ""free loveseat with purchase of sofa"" for the 
same price of $397 and represented that there was a ""LIMITED QUANTITY"" and that the ""compare"" price was $1,959.98 
— or $800 higher than the previous ""compare"" price. Amend. Counterclaim ¶ 93, ECF No. 72."
156,2," Paragraph 94 of Value City's Amended Counterclaim states: As another example, over a time period extending at least from June 2010 through January 2012, the Ashley Counterclaim 
Defendants caused, approved, permitted, authorized, and/or ratified placement of numerous advertisements offering for 
sale a particular sofa at offering prices of $399, $398, or $388, depending on the advertisement, and making various 
additional representations, stating in some advertisements that the ""compare"" price for the item was $899.99 while in other 
advertisements that the ""compare"" price was $999.99. During this time frame and depending on the advertisement, the 
purported ""compare"" price seesawed between $899.99 and $999.99. One advertisement placed in June 2010 offered this 
sofa for $398 and stated ""Save $132,"" without identifying the nature of the price [*22]  that was $132 higher, such as 
whether it referred to a former Ashley price or another retailer's price. Amend. Counterclaim ¶ 94, ECF No. 72. "
166,1," The Court finds that Plaintiff has properly pleaded the following: (2) that there was knowledge of the relationship (ECF No. 33 at 
13); (4) there was an actual disruption of the relationship (ECF No. 33 at ¶ 15); and (5) that Plaintiff suffered economic harm as a 
result of Defendant allegedly instructing staff to ignore the designation list. (ECF No. 33 at ¶¶ 10 &16.) "

182,1," Kodak's apparent admission is, in effect, that its profit from an unmatched customer is greater than its profit from a 
matched [**26]  customer, or that its profit when it is not selling ink is greater than when it is. Treating profit as the price of a 
good less its cost, the profit from an unmatched customer is the difference between the unmatched price of refurbished 
printheads (UPR) and the cost of refurbished printheads (CR): UPR − CR The profit from a matched customer (who buys both ink and refurbished printheads) is the sum of the difference between the 
matched price of refurbished printheads (MPR) and the cost of refurbished printheads (CR) and the difference between the price 
of ink (PI) and the cost of ink (CI): (MPR − CR) + (PI − CI) Kodak's admission can therefore be expressed as an inequality stating that the latter expression—profit from a matched 
customer—is less than the former—profit from an unmatched customer: (MPR − CR) + (PI − CI) < UPR − CR This is equivalent to PI − (UPR − MPR) < CI [This is achieved by adding CR + CI to each side and subtracting UPR from each side.] Under the discount attribution standard, Kodak's pricing is coercive if it is in effect selling ink below cost, that is, if the price of ink 
less the total discount (D) is less than the cost of ink: PI − D < CI Since the difference between the [**27]  unmatched price of refurbishment and the matched price of refurbishment (UPR − 
MPR) is the total discount (D) in Kodak's scheme, the above two expressions are identical. Kodak's admission thus logically 
implies that the pricing structure is coercive under the discount attribution standard. The above analysis is general and may 
ignore salient features of the Versamark printer aftermarket (for example, the fact that different customers may require different 
amounts and types of ink per refurbished printhead). But at this preliminary stage, Kodak's statements about its own business 
provide some evidence that Kodak's pricing policy fails the discount attribution test. "
188,1," Furthermore, the plaintiff has failed to allege any facts that would constitute a violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust 
Act. Setting the price of a service (see Amended Complaint [Doc. No. 11] ¶¶ 14-15) does not constitute [*4]  the type of ""price-
fixing"" that is contemplated by federal antitrust law. See infra."
188,2," See, e.g., Driessen v. Natwest Bank PLC, No. 3:13-cv-00217-MPS (alleging that two banks, including The Royal Bank of 
Scotland, violated the EFTA by failing to transfer her purported European lottery winnings to her bank account); Driessen v. 
United Nations, No. 1:12-cv-08289-LAP (S.D.N.Y), transferred, [*5]  No. 1:13-cv-20065-CMA (S.D. Fla.) (claiming that the 
defendant bank was liable under EFTA for failing to transfer her $1.2 million inheritance check to her bank account after she 
refused to pay the transfer fee); Driessen v. Citibank, N.A., No. 4:13-cv-04018-LLP (D.S.D.) (alleging that the defendant bank 
violated EFTA by failing to remit her winnings to her bank account both times that she won the UK National Lottery); Driessen v. 
Home Loan State Bank, No. 1:12-cv-02220-MSK-KLM (D. Colo.) (alleging that the defendant bank violated EFTA by failing to 
transfer a £ 3.5 million prize to her); Driessen v. Woodforest Nat'l Bank, No. 3:12-cv-00091 (S.D. Ohio) (alleging that the 
defendant bank violated EFTA by failing to transmit $8.3 million allegedly deposited with the defendant bank by the United 
Nations for her benefit); Driessen v. S. African Reserve Bank, No. 4:12-cv-00309-RAS-DDB (E.D. Tex.) (claiming that the 
defendant bank wrongfully withheld $30.5 million in violation of EFTA); see also Driessen v. Clinton, No. 4:12-cv-00227-RC-ALM 
(E.D. Tex.) (claiming that U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton informed her that she had inherited $10.5 million from a 
Nigerian relative but [*6]  then unlawfully prevented the transfer of funds on the grounds that the funds were terrorist- and drug-
related). The Court may take judicial notice of Plaintiff's other lawsuits. See Kavowras v. N.Y. Times Co., 328 F.3d 50, 57 (2d 
Cir. 2003) (""Judicial notice may be taken of public filings[.]""). "
201,1," A ""distributor"" is an entity that markets, promotes, and licenses films. (Compl. ¶ 21.) Sony Pictures and Warner Brothers are 
examples of film distributors. (Id. ¶ 61.) "
202,2," To support this contention, Plaintiffs cite the time period between January 1, 2013 and October 27, 2013, during which Sony 
Pictures licensed Elysium and Captain Phillips to the Brookhaven CinéBistro. (Compl. ¶ 61.) During those same dates, ""Sony 
Pictures licensed to one or both of AMC's Buckhead theatres After Earth, The Amazing Spider-Man, Battle of the Year, The Call, 
Carrie, Evil Dead, Grown [**7]  Ups 2, The Mortal Instruments, One Direction: This Is Us, This is the End, White House Down, 
and Zero Dark Thirty."" (Id.)"
202,3," Concerning a space located in Miami, Florida, Plaintiffs allege the President and CEO of AMC told the President and CEO of 
Cobb that AMC would use its ""full weight and power"" to prevent a CinéBistro from opening in that location. (Compl. ¶ 91.) "
205,4," Defendants contend Plaintiffs' allegations in reference to Sony are insufficient because Plaintiffs concede ""that Sony 
exclusively licensed to Cobb two of its most successful films of the last year: the award-winning Captain Phillips and Elysium."" 
(Mem. in Supp. of Defs.' Mot. to Dismiss 8 n.4.) This argument is without merit. Defendants cannot seriously contend dismissal 
is warranted by pointing out that Cobb was given crumbs when the Complaint alleges AMC was given the rest of the pie. "
207,5," The Court found the following factors relevant when considering whether a clearance is unreasonable: ""(1) [t]he admission 
prices of the theatres [**22]  involved, as set by the exhibitors; (2) [t]he character and location of the theatres involved, including 
size, type of entertainment, appointments, transit facilities, etc.; (3) [t]he policy of operation of the theatres involved, such as the 
showing of double features, gift nights, give-aways, premiums, cut-rate tickets, lotteries, etc.; (4) [t]he rental terms and license 
fees paid by the theatres involved and the revenues derived by the distributor-defendant from such theatres; (5) [t]he extent to 
which the theatres involved compete with each other for patronage; (6) [t]he fact that a theatre involved is affiliated with a 
defendant-distributor or with an independent circuit of theatres should be disregarded; and (7) there should be no clearance 
between theatres not in substantial competition."" Paramount Pictures, 334 U.S. at 145-46."
207,6," Even so, the Court is not convinced by Plaintiffs' argument that clearances serve no procompetitive purpose. As the Ninth 
Circuit noted in Movies of Tarzana, HN13[
] clearances force theatres that are denied a license to certain movies to show 
alternatives, thereby increasing movie choices for consumers. 828 F.2d at 1399-1400. This logic may apply notwithstanding 
recent advancements in the film industry. "
208,7," In their Second Notice of Supplemental Authority (Doc. No. 41), Defendants cite the Court to Starlight Cinemas v. Regal 
Entertainment Group, a case in which the court dismissed a complaint based on allegedly unlawful clearances. No. 2:14-cv-
05463 (C.D. Cal. Feb. 2, 2015) (order denying plaintiff's motion for leave to file a first amended complaint). Unlike here, the 
plaintiff in that case did not ""allege the necessary facts detailing a specific time, place, or person involved in the alleged 
conspiracies."" Id. Finding the complaint failed to allege an agreement, the court in Starlight had no reason to conduct a 
reasonableness inquiry. "
209,8," Defendants also argue that Plaintiffs' failure to properly define the relevant market precludes them from alleging potential harm 
to competition. However, [**30]  as discussed infra, the Court concludes the Complaint sufficiently pleads the contours of the 
relevant geographic and product markets."
209,9," As explained by the Eleventh Circuit in Jacobs, "
210,," HN20[
] [t]he cross-elasticity of demand measures the change in the quantity demanded by consumers of one product 
relative to the change in price of another. A high cross-elasticity of demand (that is, consumers demanding proportionately 
greater quantities of Product X in response to a relatively minor price increase in Product Y) indicates that the two products 
are close substitutes for each other—that is, consumers derive comparable utility from equivalent consumption of either 
one. For purposes of the relevant product market analysis, a high cross-elasticity of demand indicates that the two products 
in question are reasonably interchangeable substitutes for each other and hence are part of the same market."
210,626," F.3d at 1337 n.13 (citing United States v. E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. (Cellophane), 351 U.S. 377, 391, 76 S. Ct. 994, 
100 L. Ed. 1264 (1956)). "
211,10," Defendants half-heartedly suggest that Plaintiffs' lack standing to bring this suit given their purported failure to allege antitrust 
injury. HN22[
] Standing is a question of law. Todorov v. DCH Healthcare Auth., 921 F.2d 1438, 1448 (11th Cir. 1991). Importantly, ""antitrust standing is not simply a search for an injury in fact; it involves an analysis of prudential [**37]  
considerations aimed at preserving the effective enforcement of the antitrust laws."" Id. To conduct this analysis, a court must 
""evaluate the plaintiff's harm, the alleged wrongdoing by the defendants, and the relationship between them."" Associated Gen. 
Contractors of Calif., Inc. v. Calif. State Council of Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 535, 103 S. Ct. 897, 74 L. Ed. 2d 723 (1983). 
Having considered the record and arguments from the parties, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have alleged an injury ""of the 
type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flows from that which makes the defendants' acts unlawful."" Brunswick 
Corp., 429 U.S. at 489. Plaintiffs therefore have standing to bring this suit. "
212,11," Plaintiffs made this calculation using the seating capacities of the Brookhaven CinéBistro and AMC's Buckhead theatres. 
According to the Complaint, Defendants own 1,696 of the 2,454 theatre seats in the Buckhead-Brookhaven zone. (Compl. ¶¶ 35-
37.) "
214,12," A ""closed"" town or market is an area that has only a single theatre. Importantly, that theatre ""faces no competition in the 
market for (1) exhibiting films to [**48]  the public in that zone and (2) licensing films from distributors for exhibition in that zone."" 
(Compl. ¶ 27.) "
220,1," See, for example, D.I. 61 at 9 (""IV combines large numbers of patents regardless of their validity""); id. at 10 (IV's ""strategy of 
litigating regardless of merit is irrational as to each individual lawsuit, but is rational in pursuit of [IV's] overall anticompetitive 
hold-up strategy."")."
220,2," See, e.g., D.I. 61 at 8 (""IV's semiconductor patents carried little or no market power until IV acquired and integrated them into 
an enormous portfolio.""). "
232,1," If the validity of the patent has not yet been determined after 30 months, the FDA can give approval to the generic irrespective 
of possible infringement, but the manufacturer who then begins production of the generic does so at risk of an unfavorable 
judgment and the accrual of damages to the vindicated patent-holder. "
245,2," In the opposition [**67]  memoranda, the indirect-purchaser plaintiffs also withdraw unjust-enrichment claims under 
Pennsylvania law and claims under the antitrust laws of Kansas, New York, and Tennessee; and Humana withdraws its claims 
under the consumer-protection laws of Hawaii and Kansas, under the state antitrust laws of Florida, Ohio, and Texas, and under 
the Sherman Act (which includes all of its direct-purchaser claims). "
246,3," The defendants also make this argument with respect to the antitrust law of Massachusetts, but as mentioned above, the 
indirect-purchaser plaintiffs withdraw their claims under that law. Humana did not plead claims under it. "
252,1," iCloud is a free ""cloud service"" offered by Apple to a user of its products which allows the user ""to automatically and wirelessly"" 
store content and ""automatically and wireless push"" that content to all of the user's Apple devices. See Compl., at ¶ 12. In other 
words, iCloud allows users to backup data from their iPhone to the ""cloud"" and make it available to other Apple devices. Id. at ¶

resolution patches ""because such downloads require a Wi-Fi connection and cannot be downloaded over a Network 
connection."" Id. at ¶ 23. "
254,5," Plaintiff filed two declarations with over 200 pages of attachments along with his opposition to Apple's motions. See Docket 
Item Nos. 20-23. Apple objects to this evidence because it is neither subject to judicial notice nor specifically relied upon in the 
Complaint. The court agrees with Apple that consideration of this new information is improper. Accordingly, Apple's objection is 
sustained, and this information is disregarded for the purposes of this analysis. "
261,1," Much of the Statement of Facts submitted by Plaintiff focuses on establishing a ""conspiracy"" between Virtua and CGPA, see 
e.g., PSOF at ¶¶ 39-83, and between CGPA, Virtua and Penn, see PSOF at ¶¶ 87-113, to remove Deborah from the relevant 
market. The necessary facts surrounding [*3]  the agreements are set forth herein only to the extent that the knowledge is 
necessary to understand the issue of anticompetitive effects, which is dispositive here."
261,2," CGPA incorporated Virtua's response to the Plaintiff's Statement of Material Facts where relevant and Virtua incorporated 
CGPA's statement of material facts where relevant."

angioplasties and a PCI is a type of angioplasty. "
262,4, N.J.S.A. §26:2H-12.8. 
263,5," The factual record contains evidence in support of this point. See, e.g., Pl.'s Ex. 14 (October 2006 email from Dr. Dennis to 
Virtua Vice President, Matt Zuino, discussing a ""white knight"" strategy wherein Virtua could gain Deborah's cardiac surgery 
services); Pl.'s Ex. 31 (email from Dr. O'Neil to CGPA Executive Committee stating, ""One of [Deborah's] accountants said he 
gives them 2 years before [its] doors close. We could speed that up when we no longer do [percutaneous transluminal coronary 
angioplasties] at [Deborah]."")."
263,6," It is undisputed that Penn reached a settlement agreement with the United States to resolve alleged claims of violations of the 
Stark Act and Anti-Kickback Act as a result of its contractual relationships with CGPA. [Pl.'s Ex. 65]. "
264,7," Plaintiff has pointed to record evidence in support of its point. See, e.g., Pl.'s Ex. 57 (email discussing ""leakage"" of patients 
from Virtua to Deborah)."
264,8," There is no private cause of action for violations of the New Jersey Patient Bill of Rights. See Castro v. NYT Television, 370 
N.J. Super. 282, 291, 851 A.2d 88 (N.J. App. Div. 2004)."
264,9," Plaintiff adds that it was unable to come forward with evidence of additional patients as state court discovery is not yet 
compete. It further contends that ""anticompetitive effects were felt by all 3,100 patients pipelined to Penn."" Doc. No. 265, Pl.'s 
Supp. Br. at 1, n. 2. For purposes of this motion, this Court will draw the inference in favor of Plaintiff that many more patients 
were ""pipelined"" to Penn beyond the 20-plus cited in the Plaintiff's Statement of Fact. "
265,10," At oral argument, Plaintiff clarified that it believed this statement to be a reference to market foreclosure, which is not at issue 
here. Sept. 22, Tr. at 73-74. "
266,11," Because Plaintiff cannot demonstrate the requisite anticompetitive effects, it is not necessary for this Court to address the 
other prongs of the test. See Tunis Bros. Co., v. Ford Motor Co., 952 F.2d 715, 722 (3d Cir. 1991)(declining to address other 
prongs where plaintiff did not demonstrate adequate anticompetitive effects)."
266,12," The per se rule applies to ""plainly anticompetitive agreements or practices."" United States v. Brown Univ., 5 F.3d 658, 669 (3d 
Cir. 1993). The Plaintiff does not contend that the per se rule applies here. "
267,13," See Pl.'s Ex. 112, Vistnes Deposition: 82:13-24 (noting, in response to various hypotheticals posed by Plaintiff's counsel that 
""the economic analysis that I've conducted remains fundamentally the same in all of the situations that you are hypothesizing 
about. That economic analysis leads me to conclude that there was no harm to competition.""). "
268,14," Virtua also moves for summary judgment arguing that Plaintiff has failed to present sufficient direct or circumstantial evidence 
of concerted action. Because this Court finds that there is no genuine dispute of fact with respect to anticompetitive effects, it 
need not reach this argument. Tunis Bros. Co., Inc., 952 F.2d at 722."
268,15," See discussion infra at 27-41 regarding applicability of the ""market as a whole"" language. "
269,16," It is not enough to survive summary judgment to simply state that this Court found, at the motion to dismiss stage, that Plaintiff 
had adequately pled direct evidence of anticompetitive effects. Pleading and proof are distinct and summary judgment is the 
time Plaintiff is called on to put forth their evidentiary proof. In re IKON Office Solutions, Inc., 277 F.3d 658, 666 (3d Cir. 2002)(""a 
party will not be able to withstand a motion for summary judgment merely by making allegations; rather, the party opposing the 
motion must go beyond its pleading and designate specific facts by use of affidavits, depositions, admissions, or answers to 
interrogatories showing there is a genuine issue for trial.""). "
270,17," Notably, and tellingly, the Plaintiff fails entirely to address the language of Eichorn in its supplemental briefing to this Court on 
this very issue. "
271,18," Notably, Plaintiff cites to this case in its supplemental brief but fails to discuss the ""to the whole market"" language. In addition, 
Plaintiff contends that the Second Circuit does not require proof of a market-wide impact, citing Eiberger v. Sony Corp., 622 F.2d 
1068 (2d Cir. 1980), a case that pre-dates not only Capital Imaging (by 13 years), but also the Supreme Court's decision in 
Jefferson Parish, 466 U.S. at 31-32 (finding no Section 1 violation where ""there has been no showing that the market as a whole 
has been affected at all . . . ."")(emphasis added). In addition, the Second Circuit in K.M.B. Warehouse Distribs. v. Walker Mfg. 
Co., 61 F.3d 123, 127 (2d Cir. 1995) quotes Capital Imaging and [*38]  its language with respect to demonstrating an adverse 
impact on the market ""as a whole."""
271,19," As aptly stated by counsel for Virtua at oral argument, ""Deborah went to the trouble of getting an expert to posit the rough 
contours of the market but there is no mention whatsoever of that market in Deborah's brief in opposition to summary judgment."" 
Sept. 22, 2014 Hearing Tr. at 32:7-10. "
272,20," See Sept. 22, 2014 Tr. 50:15-18."
272,21," Plaintiff's counsel, in discussing the applicability of cases like Rome, Oltz, Tunis, and KMB Warehouse to its situation stated: If you are saying that the injury to competition was that consumers were harmed because they lost access to you, you 
know, because for one reason or another you, the plaintiff, [is] not an option for consumers anymore, then you have to 
show that you gave consumers something that everybody else in the market isn't giving them. Sept. 22, 2014 Oral Arg. Tr. 50:10-15. This Court fails to understand Plaintiff's appeal to these cases to the extent Plaintiff 
admitted that there was nothing special or different that Deborah offered. THE COURT: Are you saying that there is something special or different about Deborah that takes it out of the normal 
antitrust cases? MR. KANE: No, that's not what I'm saying, your Honor. Sept. 22, 2014 Oral Arg. Tr. 49:18-22. "

Co. v. F.T.C., 540 F.2d 303, 312 (7th Cir. 1976), the Court takes notice of the public comment submitted by the American 
Medical Association in that case as an example of evidence Methodist expects to be able to prove through fact and expert 
discovery, see Geinosky v. City of Chicago, 675 F.3d 743, 745 n.1 (7th Cir. 2012). "
285,1," Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (MERS) was dismissed as a defendant. NDeX West LLC (NDeX) filed a 
declaration of nonmonetary status under Civil Code section 2924l, subdivision (d); accordingly, it has not filed briefs in this 
appeal, but it is bound by this court's decision relating to the deed of trust. Provident filed a separate reply brief arguing that 
none of Cardoni's allegations in the operative complaint relate to it, and otherwise joining Wells Fargo's arguments."
285,2," At Wells Fargo's request, the trial court judicially noticed various documents including Cardoni's deed of trust recorded in 
November 2007, an assignment of the deed of trust recorded in April 2009, a notice of default recorded in January 2011, a 
notice of trustee's sale recorded in March 2011, and the trustee's deed upon sale recorded in December 2011. Other documents 
the court judicially noticed [*3]  included minute orders, the parties' pleadings and other records properly admissible as court

285,3," HAMP has been described thusly: ""As authorized by Congress, the United States Department of the Treasury implemented . . . 
HAMP to help homeowners avoid foreclosure during the housing market crisis of 2008. 'The goal of HAMP is to provide relief to 
borrowers who have defaulted on their mortgage payments or who are likely to default by reducing mortgage payments to 
sustainable levels, without discharging any of the underlying debt.'"" (West v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2013) 214 
Cal.App.4th 780, 785, 154 Cal. Rptr. 3d 285 (West [*4] ).) Treasury guidelines set forth threshold criteria to define the class of 
eligible borrowers, and those guidelines set forth accounting steps using a standardized net present value test to determine 
whether it is more profitable to modify the loan or to allow it to proceed to foreclosure. (Nungaray v. Litton Loan Servicing, LP 
(2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 1499, 1502, 135 Cal. Rptr. 3d 442.) ""Calculations under HAMP involve assigning values to certain 
variables that are largely within the servicers' discretion, thus precluding any entitlement to loan modifications."" (Id. at p. 1502, 
fn. 1.) "
295,4," Code of Civil Procedure section 472c, subdivision (a) states: ""When any court makes an order sustaining a demurrer without 
leave to amend the question as to whether or not such court abused its discretion in making such an order is open on appeal 
even though no request to amend such pleading was made."" "
299,5," Jolley was decided in the context of a motion for summary judgment brought by JP Morgan Chase (Chase), [*49]  which had 
assumed the assets of its predecessor, Washington Mutual Bank (WaMu). (Jolley, supra, 213 Cal.App.4th at pp. 877-878.) 
There, the plaintiff and WaMu had entered into a construction loan, which WaMu agreed to modify in 2006 to permit the plaintiff 
to complete construction. (Id. at pp. 877-879.) The plaintiff alleged that before the modification, WaMu made false 
representations about certain matters, and that there were irregularities in the loan disbursements, causing construction delays. 
(Id. at p. 878.) After Chase purchased WaMu's assets, the plaintiff continued to deal with the same people in the construction 
loan department and sought another loan modification. (Id. at p. 880.) He also dealt with a Chase employee who told him there 
was a ""'high probability'"" Chase would be able to modify the loan so as to avoid the foreclosure, the ""'likelihood was good'"", and 
that it was likely when construction was complete he could roll the construction loan into a fully amortized conventional loan. (Id. 
at p. 881.) According to plaintiff, he was induced by these representations to borrow heavily to finish the project, and he claimed 
construction delays during the loan modification negotiations prevented him from selling the property before the housing market 
collapsed. [*50]  (Ibid.) Rather than agree to a loan modification, Chase demanded payment in full and its trustee recorded a notice of default and then 
a notice of sale. (Jolley, supra, 213 Cal.App.4th at p. 881.) Plaintiff filed suit two days before the foreclosure sale, alleging 
causes of action for fraud, negligent misrepresentation, breach of contract/promissory estoppel, negligence, violation of the UCL, 
declaratory relief, accounting and reformation. (Ibid.) He also obtained a temporary restraining order prohibiting Chase from 
proceeding with the trustee's sale. (Ibid.) The trial court granted Chase's ensuing motion for summary judgment on various grounds, including that Chase, a lender, did 
not owe the plaintiff a duty of care. (Jolley, supra, 213 Cal.App.4th at pp. 884-885.) The appellate court reversed, however, as to 
the causes of action for fraud, breach of contract/promissory estoppel, negligence, violation of the UCL, and reformation. (Id. at 
pp. 893-908.) In reversing summary judgment on the plaintiff's UCL cause of action, the Court of Appeal focused in part on 
allegations indicating Chase had subjected the plaintiff to dual tracking, the ""common bank tactic"" whereby the lender pursues 
foreclosure at the same time it engages in loan modification negotiations. (Id. at pp. 901, 904.) The court observed that [*51]  the 
California Legislature made dual tracking illegal effective January 1, 2018. (Id. at pp. 904-905.) Though it acknowledged the law 
did not apply and dual tracking was not forbidden by statute at the time, the appellate court nevertheless held ""the new 
legislation and its legislative history may still contribute to its being considered 'unfair' for purposes of the UCL."" (Id. at pp. 907-
908.) "

March 3, 2015, the Court denied [**24]  plaintiffs' motions for leave to amend their complaints to the extent that they seek to join 
LME Holdings and HKEx as defendants. (ECF No. 728.) Accordingly, the LME, LME Holdings, and HKEx have all been 
dismissed from this action. "

309,8," The Court has considered whether these additional materials and allegations would alter its conclusions as to the claims it 
dismisses herein; they do not."
309,9," The TAC at times refers to the LME cash price as the ""LME Settlement Price."" (See TAC ¶ 176.)"
309,10," Plaintiffs allege that the LME certifies a global network of more than 700 warehouses, with close to 200 located in the United 
States. (JAC ¶ 127; TAC ¶ 188.) Defendants Metro, Henry Bath LLC and Pacorini are alleged collectively to operate more than 
75-80% of the LME certified warehouses in the United States and throughout the world. (JAC ¶ 127; TAC ¶ 188.) In the United 
States, LME warehouses are located in Detroit, Baltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles, Mobile, New Orleans, Owensboro, St. Louis, 
and Toledo. (JAC ¶ 130; TAC¶ 190.) Defendants Metro and Pacorini are alleged to have warehouses in Detroit; Henry Bath is 
not. (JAC ¶ 130; TAC ¶ 190(a).) LME warehouses are alleged to be a critical [**29]  part of the supply chain for aluminum in the 
United States because, inter alia, it is only in such warehouses that LME warrants can be issued and cancelled. (JAC ¶ 131; 
TAC ¶ 194.) An LME warrant is a standardized document issued by a warehouse upon delivery of a lot of aluminum into that 
warehouse, and it indicates who has the right of possession of that particular lot of aluminum. (JAC ¶ 132; TAC ¶ 195.) "
311,11," The Goldman Sachs entities are the Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (""Goldman Sachs"") and those entities affiliated with Goldman

Sachs International (JAC ¶ 52; TAC ¶ 89), Metro (JAC ¶ 55; TAC ¶ 92), J. Aron (TAC ¶ 88), and Mitsi (TAC ¶ 93). The TAC also 
names as defendants alleged agents of Metro, BAP (TAC ¶ 88) and Robert Burgess-Allen (TAC ¶ 129). On August 29, 2014, the 
Court dismissed all claims against Goldman Sachs and all entities affiliated with Goldman Sachs that [**33]  were named as 
defendants in plaintiffs' initial pleadings. (1st MTD Op.) On March 3, 2015, the Court granted Goldman Sachs' motion to dismiss 
and denied plaintiffs' motions for leave to amend their complaints to the extent that they seek to join Goldman Sachs as a

(JAC ¶ 61; TAC ¶ 100), and Henry Bath LLC (JAC ¶ 68; TAC ¶ 107). On August 29, 2014, the Court dismissed all claims against 
JPMorgan and all entities affiliated with JPMorgan that were named as defendants in plaintiffs' initial pleadings. (1st MTD Op.) 
On March 3, 2015, the Court granted Henry Bath & Son Ltd.'s motion to dismiss the JAC and denied plaintiffs' motions for leave 
to amend their complaints to the extent that they seek to add Henry Bath & Son Ltd. as a defendant. (ECF No. 728.) [**35]  On 
March 4, 2015, the Court denied plaintiffs' motions for leave to amend their complaints to the extent that they seek to join 
JPMorgan as a defendant, and granted Henry Bath & Son Ltd.'s motion to dismiss the JAC. (ECF Nos. 729, 731.) The following 
JPMorgan entities have not to date been dismissed from this action (and remain in this action): JPMorgan Securities plc and

311,14," Pacorini consists of the following two entities, which have been named as defendants in both the JAC and the TAC: Pacorini 
USA (JAC ¶ 78; TAC ¶¶ 110, 122) and its corporate parent Pacorini Metals AG (JAC ¶ 79; TAC ¶¶ 110, 123). Pacorini USA is 
alleged to own and operate LME-certified warehouses in the United States. (JAC ¶ 78; TAC ¶ 122.) In the TAC, plaintiffs group 
""Glencore,"" Pacorini Metals USA LLC, Pacorini Metals AG, and non-defendant Pacorini BV into the single collective term 
""Pacorini."" (TAC ¶ 125.) On March 4, 2015, the Court denied plaintiffs' motions for leave to amend their complaints to the extent 
they seek to join Pacorini Metals AG as a defendant. (ECF No. 729.) Pacorini USA has not to date been dismissed from this 
action (and remains in this action). "
314,15," Precisely how the trading operations obtained benefits is unclear—was it through, as plaintiffs allege, the exploitation of a 
contango? (See, e.g., JAC ¶¶ 295-96; TAC ¶¶ 608-09.) An ability to exploit differences between spreads or short and long 
positions? An ability to use warrants to advantage other trading opportunities such as equities or derivative positions? While the 
manifestation of the benefits is unclear, the economic plausibility of some advantage is sufficient at the pleading stage. The 
Court notes that in the absence of demonstrated tangible benefits by alleged conspirators following discovery, the case may well 
be narrowed."
314,16," Defendants frequently and correctly quote this Court's prior decision dismissing prior pleadings. The Court believes its 
recitation of the law as set forth in that opinion was correct. The primary difference between the prior pleadings and the TAC and 
JAC is the refinement of the presentation of the alleged conspiracy (particularly in the JAC and its supporting papers). The 
addition of theoretical underpinnings to how and why the trading arms work with the warehouses, as well as the proffered 
factual [**45]  support, alters the landscape."
314,17," As the Court has previously noted, Kodak is in a different procedural posture from the other plaintiffs. That difference does not 
have substantive significance for purposes of the instant motions. The JAC is in fact an amended pleading for Kodak and 
motions to dismiss it are therefore [**46]  evaluated under Rule 12(b)(6). For the remaining plaintiffs, the pleadings are 
""proposed"" and evaluated under the futility standard for amendments set forth in Rule 15 and interpreting case law. See Xiang 
Li. v. Morrisville State Coll., 434 Fed. App'x 34, 35 (2d Cir. 2011) (summary order) (justice does not require a court to grant a 
plaintiff leave to amend a complaint under Rule 15(a)(2) ""if amendment would be futile""). But at bottom, the 12(b)(6) standard 
and the Rule 15 futility standard are essentially the same. Lucente v. Int'l Bus. Mach. Corp., 310 F.3d 243, 258 (2d Cir. 2002) 
(""An amendment to a pleading is futile if the proposed claim could not withstand a motion to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 
12(b)(6)."") For convenience, and consistent with the manner of argument of the parties, the Court therefore refers to Rule 
12(b)(6) and interpreting case law."
314,18," Defendants assert that many of the quotes that plaintiffs set forth in the TAC and JAC are taken out of context, clearly misread 
the document, or support an opposite inference. The Court has reviewed the materials submitted. There is certainly support for "
315,," defendants' positions in this regard, but the Court is mindful that at this stage plaintiffs are entitled to reasonable inferences 
being drawn in their favor. Discovery may make clear that there either is or is not a triable issue as to the proffered 
interpretations."
315,19," If the Court can infer no more than ""the mere possibility of misconduct"" from the factual averments, dismissal is appropriate. 
Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679-80 (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570)."
315,20," The parties raise numerous arguments in their papers. This Court has reviewed all of them and addresses herein only those 
that are required for resolution of the instant motions. For instance, defendants argue that many alleged acts cannot themselves 
constitute violations of the antitrust laws. In this Opinion, the Court is not ruling otherwise (though it does not address each act 
seriatim). Instead, it bases its decision on the existence of a sufficient basis [**49]  for plausibility for the pleadings to pass 
muster at this stage. "
317,21," One plaintiff, Ampal, states that it may have obtained aluminum directly from Glencore (TAC ¶ 49)—but it is not clear from the 
allegations in the TAC whether that was through a settled warrant, through owned physical stocks, or in some other manner."
317,22," Plaintiffs must establish antitrust standing with respect to each antitrust claim pursued. See Daniel v. Am. Bd. of Emergency 
Med., 428 F.3d 408, 436-38 (2d Cir. 2005) (antitrust standing inquiry is injury-specific). Accordingly, the Court reviews standing 
with regard to the FLPs' § 1 and § 2 claims separately. [**55] "
318,23," A more complete description of McCready is set forth in the Court's Opinion & Order dated August 29, 2014. (1st MTD Op. at 
35.) "
319,24," One of the FLPs, Ampal, Inc. (""Ampal""), alleges that it purchased aluminum directly from Glencore. (TAC ¶ 49.)"
319,25," In the JAC, Mag, Agfa, and Kodak assert that but for the defendants' anticompetitive conduct, they might consider purchasing 
and storing aluminum in an LME warehouse—that is, ""but for"" the conduct, some plaintiffs would be consumers of warehouse 
services. (JAC ¶ 4.) However, plaintiffs do not allege any facts to support this claim. For instance, the JAC is devoid of factual 
allegations in which plaintiffs assert that on certain dates they considered purchasing and storing aluminum but load-out delays 
prevented them from doing so. In the TAC, plaintiffs allege that but for defendants' conduct they might have hedged certain 
transactions. (See TAC ¶¶ 317, 319, 412.) This assertion is similarly devoid of sufficient factual support. The [**62]  Court 
assumes that these assertions were included in the JAC and the TAC to assist with standing arguments. As the Court finds that 
plaintiffs have adequately plead standing for other reasons, it need not address these assertions."
319,26," The cases in which alleged purposeful commodity trading inefficiency has led to collateral damage in physical markets are 
Loeb Industries, Inc. v. Sumitomo Corp., 306 F.3d 469 (7th Cir. 2002); In re Crude Oil Commodity Litig., No. 06 Civ. 6677(NRB), 
2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 47902, 2007 WL 1946553 (S.D.N.Y. June 28, 2007); and Ice Cream Liquidation, Inc. v. Land O'Lakes, 
Inc., 253 F. Supp. 2d 262 (D. Conn. 2003). This Court does not necessarily agree with the manner in which the courts in those 
cases described the anticompetitive condition, conduct or markets. Nevertheless, they are instructive. "
320,27," See note 24, supra. "
321,28," In the JAC, J. Aron is alleged to be a trading division of Goldman Sachs (JAC ¶ 51), and it is not named individually as a 
defendant. The TAC alleges that J. Aron is a wholly owned subsidiary of Goldman Sachs and names it as an individual 
defendant. (TAC ¶ 88.) "
322,29," This point may have more importance at a later stage of the case. If discovery reveals that only related and controlled entities 
were involved in certain conduct, a Section 1 claim would not lie. "
323,30, Nor is the scheme alleged a type of monopoly leveraging claim; such a claim would present additional issues. 
324,31," If this Court were to agree with plaintiffs that the alleged restraints should be analyzed as per se violations of the antitrust laws, 
then plaintiffs' pleading burden as to market definition would be lower. See State Oil, 522 U.S. at 10; see also Paycom, 467 F.3d 
at 289. The Court also notes that ""[i]n this Circuit, a threshold showing of market share is not a prerequisite for bringing a § 1 claim."" 
Todd, 275 F.3d at 206; K.M.B. Warehouse Distribs., Inc. v. Walker Mfg. Co., 61 F.3d 123, 129 (2d Cir. 1995) (""If a plaintiff can 
show an actual adverse effect on competition, such as reduced output . . . we do not require a further showing of market 
power."")."
324,32," The JAC describes this market as the ""market for LME-certified warehouse services for aluminum."" (JAC ¶ 144.) The TAC 
uses four distinct terms to refer to this market: the ""market for warehouse services for LME aluminum"" (TAC ¶ 203); the ""market 
for aluminum warehouse services in LME-registered warehouses"" (TAC ¶¶ 204, 209); the ""market for warehouse services of 
aluminum in LME-registered warehouses"" (TAC ¶ 207); and the ""aluminum warehouse market for LME-registered warehouses"" 
(TAC ¶ 422). The Court assumes for purposes of this motion that the JAC's term for this market, the ""market for LME-certified 
warehouse services for aluminum,"" captures all of the TAC's conceptions of this market. "
326,33," In Mayor & City Council of Baltimore, the Second Circuit reviewed whether allegations of certain parallel conduct in the auction 
rate securities market were sufficient to support a § 1 conspiracy. Plaintiffs alleged that defendant banks conspired with 
each [**88]  other to simultaneously stop buying auction rate securities for their own proprietary accounts, causing auctions to 
fail and the market to collapse. 709 F.3d at 131-32. The Court found that the allegations supported only parallel conduct. Id. at 
138. The Court began by noting that the crucial question in a § 1 case is whether the challenged conduct stems from an agreement, 
and that the existence of such an agreement is a legal conclusion to be determined by the court—and not a factual allegation. Id. 
at 135-36 (citing Starr v. Sony BMG Music Entm't, 592 F.3d 314, 319 n.2 (2d Cir. 2010)). The Court further stated that plaintiffs 
must allege additional circumstances supporting an inference of conspiracy; merely alleging that parallel conduct occurred is 
insufficient to overcome a motion to dismiss because it would ""risk propelling defendants into expensive antitrust discovery on 
the basis of acts that could just as easily turn out to have been rational business behavior as they could a proscribed antitrust 
conspiracy."" Id. at 136-37. The Court found that defendants' alleged actions—an en masse flight from a collapsing market in 
which they had significant downside exposure—made perfect sense in light of their business interests. Id. at 138. This made the 
case different from Starr, in which specific allegations [**89]  supporting an inference that defendants' parallel conduct was 
against their own economic selfinterest led the Second Circuit to conclude that plaintiffs had plausibly alleged an antitrust 
conspiracy. See id. at 138-39 (citing Starr, 592 F.3d at 327.) Accordingly, the Court affirmed defendants' motion to dismiss. Id. at 
140. "
328,34," The Court notes that of the 146 LME-certified warehouses in the United States as of 2014, the warehouse defendants are 
alleged to own 123, or 84%. (See TAC ¶ 190.) The TAC is devoid of allegations regarding LME-certified warehouses not owned 
by defendants. "
329,35, The Court here incorporates the legal standard for standing set forth above.
329,36," The TAC lists [**101]  the Cartwright Act as a cause of action without breaking out its elements or explaining how they are 
met. (TAC ¶ 651(d).) Accordingly, the Court dismisses the FLPs' Cartwright Act claim under the Rule 8 analysis listed below. "
330,37," The TAC does list the elements of the causes of action under New York's and Rhode Island's [**102]  consumer protection 
and unfair competition laws. (TAC ¶ 655(s),(u).) However, these lists are presented in precisely the formulaic, conclusory 
manner no longer permitted under Iqbal. See 556 U.S. at 678. Further, the TAC is devoid of the state-specific allegations 
regarding defendants' engagement in commerce, public statements, and effects on plaintiffs within those states required to 
establish that these claims are plausible. These claims are therefore also properly dismissed."
330,38, The JAC does not contain class allegations. 
375,*, The initial Opinion was filed under seal to protect any confidential information asserted by the parties. 
376,1," Plaintiffs argue specifically that the Second AP Agreement and the Replay Agreement (defined below) should not be 
considered because Plaintiffs are not parties to the agreements, had no possession of the agreements, and had no ""direct 
knowledge of the terms of these agreements."" (Pls.' Opp'n to AP Mot. 15.) However, HN1[
] courts may consider documents 
on a motion to dismiss, even if not incorporated by reference [**5]  in a complaint, ""where the complaint 'relies heavily upon its 
terms and effect,' thereby rendering the document 'integral' to the complaint. DiFolco v. MSNBC Cable LLC, 622 F.3d 104, 111 
(2d Cir. 2010) (citations omitted); see also Chamberlain v. City of White Plains, 986 F. Supp. 2d 363 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (On a 
motion to dismiss, the Court may consider documents that are ""integral"" to Plaintiffs' AC, that is, documents ""upon the terms and 
effect of which the complaint relies heavily . . . .""). The AC refers to and relies on these agreements (see AC ¶¶ 20, 25-26, 27, 
28, 38, 54, 79, 92, 116, 136, 138, 139, 140, 141, 157, 166, 175, 181), the agreements were discussed and quoted in NFL's initial "
377,," unredacted motion to dismiss (see Dkt. No. 30) and copies of these two agreements were attached as exhibits to the declaration 
of Andrew L. Deutsch (see Deutsch Decl. Exs. A-D) in support of AP's first motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' Complaint. See 
Chambers v. Time Warner, Inc., 282 F.3d 147, 153-54 & n. 4 (2d Cir. 2002) (contracts properly considered on Rule 12(b)(6) 
motion where ""the Amended Complaint [was] replete with references to the contracts"" and requested adjudication related to their 
terms); see also Feinman v. Schulman Berlin & Davis, 677 F. Supp. 168, 170 n. 3 (S.D.N.Y. 1988) (finding document referred to 
in complaint, but not identified by name, incorporated by reference). The Court ""need not credit . . . characterizations presented 
as factual allegations,"" In re Livent, Inc. Noteholders Securities Litig., 151 F. Supp. 2d 371, 404 (S.D.N.Y. 2001), or ""accept as

377,2," ""NFL Entities,"" as defined in the AC, refers to the same entities defined herein by the same abbreviation."
377,3," Plaintiffs allege that they primarily photographed NFL events and games under ""speculation agreements,"" or ""on spec,"" 
meaning that instead of being paid flat fees for their work they retained ownership of the copyrights in the photos that they took 
during an event and then earned income by licensing their photos. (AC ¶ 32.) Plaintiffs note that this action only involve those 
photos that Plaintiffs created on spec. (AC ¶ 33.) "
380,4, Discussion of the Getty Contributor Agreements is limited to the terms relevant to Getty's motion to compel arbitration.
380,5," ""AP Contributor Agreements"" as used herein collectively refers to all the AP Contributor Agreements between AP and Plaintiffs. 
Terms are substantially the same across AP Contributor Agreements, although in some AP Contributor Agreements, the terms 
are divided only by section numbers, while in others, section and subsection numbers are used. Citations reference both section 
and subsection numbers. References to a specific AP Contributor Agreement are prefaced by the particular Plaintiff's name. "
381,6," ""Event Photos"" are defined as the photographs taken by the contributor at an ""Event,"" which have been selected by the 
contributor as his best photographs taken at the Event (""Best Cut Photos"") (AP Contributor Agreements § 3.1) and which AP has 
not rejected. (Id. §3.4). ""NFL Event Photos"" are Event Photos taken at ""NFL Events,"" which are Events credentialed, promoted, 
sponsored or requested by the NFL, its affiliates, and its member clubs. (Id.) Some AP Contributor Agreements also use the 
term ""Final Photos,"" which refer to the contributor's Event Photos together with his ""Archival Event Photos"" (photos taken by the 
contributor at NFL games prior to the effective date of the AP Contributor Agreement). (Id. § 3.2.1.) "
382,7," Some of the AC Contributor Agreements contain a ""minimum royalty"" provision. However, minimum royalties are due only 
where AP has made an ""a la carte sale of licenses for Event Photos."" (AP Contributor Agreements § 5.1.) "
385,8," To the extent that Plaintiffs rely on agreements not pleaded in the AC (see Pls.' Opp'n to Getty Mot. 28 (arguing that Plaintiffs' 
claims arise under separate subsequent agreements with no arbitration clauses that are not mentioned in the AC)), their 
arguments are disregarded. See Klauber Bros., Inc. v. Russell-Newman, Inc., 11 CIV. 4985 PGG, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 42758, 
2013 WL 1245456, at *11 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2013) [**35] , aff'd sub nom Klauber Bros., Inc. v. Bon-Ton Stores, Inc., 557 F. 
App'x 77 (2d Cir. 2014) (""Allegations made outside of the complaint are not properly before the court on a motion to dismiss."") 
(citations omitted). HN13[
] Claims that are raised for the first time in an opposition brief are not properly before the court. U.S. Bank Nat'l Ass'n v. PHL Variable Ins. Co., 12 CIV. 6811 CM JCF, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 38768, 2013 WL 791462, at *2 
(S.D.N.Y. Mar. 5, 2013). Furthermore, Plaintiffs' assertions that the fact that NFL Defendants ""are indispensable parties to 
Plaintiffs' claims against Getty involving secondary forms of liability"" makes the secondary infringement claims against Getty are 
non-arbitrable must also fail. HN14[
] Secondary infringement claims are often litigated without joinder of any alleged direct 
infringer. See generally, Viacom Int'l, Inc. v. YouTube, Inc., 676 F.3d 19 (2d Cir. 2012); Capitol Records, Inc. v. MP3tunes, LLC, 
821 F. Supp. 2d 627 (S.D.N.Y. 2011); Capitol Records, LLC v. Vimeo, LLC, 972 F. Supp. 2d 537 (S.D.N.Y. 2013); Arista 
Records LLC v. Lime Grp. LLC, 784 F. Supp. 2d 398 (S.D.N.Y. 2010). "
387,9," Collins [**42]  & Aikman did not involve an antitrust claim. At issue there was which of two contracts between the parties was 
implicated by the plaintiffs' state-law claims. See 58 F.3d at 23 (""the task of determining whether a clam or a set of claims 'arises 
out of or relates to' the particular contract in which the arbitration clause is found was properly determined by the district court"") 
(emphasis added). "
388,10," HN22[
] Section 3 of the Sherman Act merely extends the reach of Section 1 to trade or commerce involving U.S. Territories 
and the District of Columbia. Substantively, [**45]  however, Section 3 claims are analyzed in the same manner as Section 1 
claims. See Dart Drug Corp. v. Parke, Davis & Co., 344 F.2d 173, 174 n. 1, 120 U.S. App. D.C. 79 (D.C. Cir. 1965) (""Section 3 
is, in terms of the substantive offense defined therein, an exact counterpart of Section 1, made expressly applicable to the 
Territories and the District of Columbia."")."
388,11," Consistent with the rest of this opinion, this section's mention of Getty does not serve as a determination with respect to 
Getty's antitrust liability but rather mentions Getty as an alleged participant in Plaintiffs' asserted antitrust conspiracy. "
391,12," That these more direct entities have not filed suit is telling. As the Supreme Court has observed, ""if there is substance to 
[plaintiffs] claim, it is difficult to understand why the[] direct victims of the conspiracy have not asserted any claim [**55]  in their 
own right."" Associated Gen. Contractors, 459 U.S. at 542 n. 47; see also Phillip Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, Fundamentals of 
Antitrust Law, § 3.01c (4th ed. 2011) (""If the 'superior' plaintiff has not sued, one may doubt the existence of any antitrust 
violation at all.""). "
392,13," See also Hack v. President & Fellows of Yale Coll., 237 F.3d 81, 86-87 (2d Cir. 2000), abrogated on other grounds 
(concluding that plaintiff had failed to allege a plausible relevant product market confined to Yale education because other 
colleges and universities provided interchangeable substitutes); Carell, 104 F. Supp. 2d at 264-66 (rejecting alleged ""market for 
licensing Makeup Designs [for the Broadway musical Cats] and other Cats-related intellectual property""); Global Disc. Travel

679 (S .D.N.Y. 1987) (""This Court does not need protracted discovery to state with confidence that Rolex watches are 
reasonably interchangeable with other high quality timepieces.""). "
394,14," At a minimum, under American Needle the collective licensing of intellectual property for NFL-related photographs is 
reasonable as a matter of law because collective licensing is ""essential if the product is to be available at all."" 560 U.S. at 203. In 
such cases, ""the Rule of Reason may not require a detailed [**66]  analysis; it 'can sometimes be applied in the twinkling of an 
eye.'"" Id.; see also Agnew v. NCAA, 683 F.3d 328, 341 (7th Cir. 2012) (concluding that under American Needle, certain 
restraints, particularly necessary venture activities, may be held procompetitive, and thus lawful, in the ""twinkling of an eye"" - i.e., 
""at the motion-to-dismiss stage""). Here, without NFL and NFL Club cooperation, licensees would be unable to obtain from any 
one entity the rights to use photographs of NFL games and events, which exist only by virtue of that cooperation. See American 
Needle, 560 U.S. at 202 (""The fact that NFL teams share an interest in making the entire league successful and profitable, and 
that they must cooperate in the production and scheduling of games, provides a perfectly sensible justification for making a host 
of collective decisions.""). Moreover, the pro-competitive benefits of collectively licensing intellectual property rights in NFL-
related photographs are abundantly clear. See Broad. Music, Inc. v. Columbia Broad. Sys., Inc., 441 U.S. 1, 18-23, 99 S. Ct. 
1551, 60 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1979). If a collective license were not available, a photo-by-photo assessment would be required to 
determine who may hold intellectual property rights in any given photograph, and individual licensing negotiations would be 
required for every single photograph. "
395,15," The Second Circuit made clear that although it might be ""difficult"" to obtain licenses outside the joint venture, ""realistic 
alternative[s]"" to a collective license exist so long as individual licensing remains possible. Buffalo Broad., 744 F.2d at 929. The 
court reached this conclusion without any showing that alternatives to the blanket license were popular, or even that any such 
alternatives had ever been actively pursued. Id. at 928 (finding no evidence that ""any loca1 [television] station ever offered any 
composer a sum of money in exchange for the performing rights to his music""). Thus, so long as an individual venture member is 
not precluded from granting an individual license, a collective licensing agreement may not, as a matter of law, violate Section 1."
395,16," Plaintiffs also take issue with NFLP's decision in 2009 to grant exclusive licensing rights to AP, rather than Getty. (AC ¶ 55.) 
But ""freedom to switch suppliers lies close to the heart of the competitive process that the antitrust laws seek to encourage."" 
Nynex Corp. v. Discon, Inc., 525 U.S. 128, 137, 119 S. Ct. 493, 142 L. Ed. 2d 510 (1997). Therefore, ""[i]t is not 'a violation of the 
antitrust laws, without a showing of actual adverse effect on competition market-wide, for a manufacturer to terminate a 
distributor . . . and to appoint an exclusive distributor.'"" E & L Consulting, Ltd., 472 F.3d at 29 (alteration in original, citation 
omitted). "
398,17," Specifically, Plaintiffs allege: • ""[T]he NFL Defendants leveraged their illegal monopoly to obtained [sic] unfettered access to Plaintiffs' works and force 
Plaintiffs' agents to purportedly grant 'complimentary' or 'non-royalty bearing"" licenses."" (AC ¶ 75.) • ""AP granted this retroactive 'license' to the NFL under threats of coercive pressure by the NFL, including the threat of 
moving its exclusive license back to Getty Images, which had submitted a bid to reacquire the NFL's business."" (AC ¶ 88.) • ""The NFL exploited its illegal control and monopoly of the commercial licensing rights to NFL content to force Getty 
Images and now AP to grant the NFL unfettered access to Plaintiffs' image libraries and to rob Plaintiffs of their rightful 
compensation for such uses."" (AC ¶ 95). • ""The NFL has been able to convince Plaintiffs' licensing agents to purportedly allow this rampant and blatant exploitation 
of Plaintiffs' works only because of its illegal monopoly over the commercial [**81]  licensing rights to NFL content."" (AC ¶ 
96.) • ""The NFL Defendants' illegal conduct directly and proximately created the circumstances that forced Plaintiffs into a 'take-
it-or-leave-it' scenario when negotiating license terms with the NFL's chosen exclusive licensing partner (first Getty Images 
until 2009 and then AP thereafter)."" (AC ¶ 144.) • ""If it were not for the NFL's illegal efforts to control the commercial licensing market for NFL-related stock photos, Plaintiff's 
licensing agents would not have been forced to purportedly grant the NFL 'complimentary' usage of Plaintiffs' photos."" (AC 
¶ 148.) "
399,18," Because Getty's motion to compel arbitration is granted, the claims regarding the NFL Defendants' uses of Plaintiffs' Getty 
photos will be stayed pending arbitration. See, e.g, Hikers Indus., Inc. v. William Stuart Indus. (Far East) Ltd., 640 F. Supp. 175, 
178 (S.D.N.Y. 1986) (HN39[
] ""A stay as to claims against a nonarbitrating defendant is properly granted where the arbitration 
of the plaintiff's claims against a defendant party to the arbitration would at least partially determine the issues which form the 
basis of the claim against that non-arbitrating defendant.""). "
400,19, [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT]
400,20," Plaintiffs cite to S.O.S., Inc. v. Payday, Inc., 886 F.2d 1081, 1088 (9th Cir. 1989) to support their argument. However, S.O.S. 
merely states the standard rule that copyright licenses are presumed to ""prohibit any use not authorized."" Id. at 1087."
400,21," Plaintiffs make several assertions which will be briefly addressed. First, Plaintiffs contend that AP did not contest the 
plausibility of their copyright claims. This, however, is clearly contradicted by AP's moving memorandum. (See AP Mot. 13-19.) 
Second, Plaintiffs make a passing assertion that the AP Contributor Agreements may be invalid due to ""fraud."" (Pls.' Opp'n to AP "
401,," Mot. 18.) However, the AC does not allege fraud, so this contention will be disregarded. Last, Plaintiffs make mention of the 
doctrine of contra proferentum [**90]  (Pls.' Opp'n to AP Mot. 22 n. 8), but HN42[
] that doctrine only applies where a contract 
is ambiguous which, as discussed below, the contracts do not appear to be, and only where there are no other interpretative 
tools to determine the parties' intent. See Chesapeake Energy Corp. v. Bank Of New York Mellon Trust Co., N.A., 773 F.3d 110, 
117 n. 3 (2d Cir. 2014); Int'l Multifoods Corp. v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., 309 F.3d 76, 88 n. 7 (2d Cir. 2002). Here, the 
AP Contributor Agreements' meaning may be clearly gleaned from their text."
401,22," Plaintiffs further [**91]  contend that if AP were correct that it was permitted to 'sublicense' its rights, ""then it must follow that 
the NFL would be burdened with all of the responsibilities and limitations of the license grant."" (Pls.' Opp'n to AP Mot. 24.) 
However, this assertion is without support."
401,23," [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] (§ the effective date of his AP Contributor Agreement, when AP acquired the right to 
license his photos. AP's sublicense to the NFL Entities thus covers their uses of each Plaintiff's photos for the period occurring 
on or after the effective date of that Plaintiff's AP Contributor Agreement. "
402,24," Furthermore, there are basic differences between Davis and the facts of this case. In Davis, there was no written agreement 
between [**94]  the copyright co-owners. One of the co-owners assigned his interest (including, purportedly, all causes of action 
for infringement of the copyright) to a person who had been sued for infringement by the other co-owner. The assignee then 
claimed that he was immune from the second co-owner's infringement suit. Davis held that the assignment cannot be given 
retroactive effect to defeat the suing co-owner's vested infringement claim, because one co-owner has no power to grant an 
exclusive license or release another co-owner's accrued claims. Id., 505 F.3d at 103-04. Here, however, each Plaintiff is the sole 
owner of the copyright in his photos and AP's sublicense does not affect the rights of any copyright co-owner. Each Plaintiff 
granted AP all rights comprised within copyright for the full term of his written AP Contributor Agreement, and gave AP the right 
to license others to make any use of the photos that AP could make. Although the license from Plaintiff Lowrance to AP is 
technically non-exclusive (see Lowrance AP Contributor Agreement § 4.2), this fact does not limit AP's right to issue retroactive 
licenses in Lowrance's photos to the full extent of AP's licensed rights. "
405,25," The sole exception is a stray reference to ""individual NFL Teams"" distributing unspecified ""game programs"" that included 
Plaintiffs' works. (AC ¶ 101.) Even as to this purported use, however, it is ""the NFL"" that is alleged to have ""copied and 
published"" Plaintiffs' works. In their opposition, Plaintiffs, without disputing that the AC lacks specific allegations of infringement 
by any of the 32 NFL clubs, assert that they are permitted to plead infringement ""upon information and belief."" (Pls.' Opp'n to 
NFL Def.'s Mot. 22.) This, type of pleading, however, is precisely the sort that cannot survive a motion to dismiss. See Palmer 
Kane LLC v. Scholastic Corp., No. 12 Civ. 3890, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27196, 2013 WL 709276, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 27, 2013) 
(holding that a complaint must ""contain some factual allegations to narrow the infringing acts beyond [**105]  broad conclusory 
statements of infringement""); Broughel v. Battery Conservancy, No. 07-cv-7755, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 35048, 2009 WL 
928280, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 30, 2009) (noting that ""it is axiomatic that plaintiff's claims cannot rest on inchoate and conclusory 
accusations of unauthorized copying""). Additionally, Plaintiffs' reliance on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b) is misplaced - 
HN49[
] the rule does not relieve a party of the obligation to meet basic pleading standards established by Rule 8(a)(2) and current Circuit 12(b)(6) case law."
405,26," Even assuming arguendo that Plaintiffs had sufficiently alleged infringing acts by any of the NFL Clubs, any copyright claim 
would nevertheless fail for the same reasons that the copyright claim against the NFL fails (as discussed below), including that 
the alleged uses of Plaintiffs' photographs are fully authorized and that allegations that Plaintiffs have been deprived of royalties 
can only give rise to breach of contract claims against Getty and AP. In this regard, the Getty and AP Agreements expressly 
permit the NFL Clubs to make the me marketing uses of intiffs' photographs a NFL. (Getty Agreement ; First AP Agreement, 
Second AP Agreement .) "
407,27," As with the Getty Agreement and First and Second AP Agreements, Plaintiffs' argument that the Court should not consider the 
Replay Agreement is unavailing. The Replay Agreement was attached as an exhibit to AP's original motion to dismiss the 
Complaint, which was incorporated by reference by Replay. (See Dkt. Nos. 26-28, 36-38.) Additionally, Plaintiffs' reliance on 
extraneous material to support contentions not found in the AC will be disregarded. See, e.g., Adams v. Crystal City Mariott 
Hotel, 02 Civ. 10258 (PKL), 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5819 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 5, 2004). "
408,28," Ownership of copyright in the photos does not give Plaintiffs the exclusive right to pursue claims for infringement. For all 
Plaintiffs except Lowrance, AP is an exclusive licensee, and HN53[
] AP has the right to sue for infringement of its exclusive license rights. 17 U.S.C. §501(b); Eden Toys, Inc. v. Florelee Undergarment Co.., 697 F.2d 27, 32 (2d Cir. 1982), superseded on 
other grounds by Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a)."
408,29," Plaintiffs' allegations regarding the content of the First and Second AP Agreements (AC ¶¶ 175-76) or a request by AP to 
amend the AP Contributor Agreements (AC ¶¶ 116, 196-97) are similarly unavailing. It is the AP Contributor Agreements, not 
alleged unconsummated amendments [**116]  to those contracts, that govern AP's right to license and sublicense Plaintiffs' 
photos. As detailed above, the broad license granted in the AP Contributor Agreements is the operative provision with respect to 
Plaintiffs' copyright infringement and breach of contract claims. Plaintiffs' inclusion of allegations regarding ""rights managed 
licensing"" which constitute extrinsic evidence is not considered in light of the unambiguous terms of the AP Contributor 
Agreements and the agreements' merger clause, which states that each AP Contributor Agreement ""incorporates the entire 
understanding of the Parties and supersedes any and all prior agreements, oral or written, relating to Photographer's relationship 
with AP and is intended as a complete and exclusive statement of the terms of the arrangement between the parties."" (AP 
Contributor Agreements § 10); see also Abha Int'l, LLC v. Clover Int'l Corp., 11 Civ. 6841, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 23089, 2012 
WL 569187, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 16, 2012) (HN54[
] ""A 'general merger clause' . . . 'precludes extrinsic proof to add or to or 
vary' the terms of the agreement.""). "
410,30," Plaintiffs allege in their breach of contract count that the AP Contributor Agreements specifically provided that Plaintiffs 
retained the ""exclusive right to pursue claims for infringements."" (AC ¶ 221.) Plaintiffs then allege in their breach of fiduciary duty 
count that in AP's prior motion to dismiss, AP claimed that ""it is entitled to pursue and settle infringement claims on plaintiffs' 
behalf"" and that, as such, AP ""must either claim such authority as [**121]  co-owners of the underlying copyrights or as agents 
for the copyright owners."" (AC ¶¶ 234, 236.) All Plaintiffs but Lowrance have issued exclusive licenses to AP encompassing all 
of their rights in copyright. This exclusive license gives AP the right to sue infringers as a matter of law - not for infringement of 
Plaintiffs' rights, but for infringement of AP's own rights. Were AP to sue for infringement, it would neither be acting as a co-
owner of copyright nor as an agent of Plaintiffs. Thus, AP's right to sue for infringement does not bear on whether AP is an agent 
of Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs are bound by their own contractual agreements that unambiguously state that AP does not act as their 
agent, i.e., fiduciary. "
412,31," The fact that Plaintiffs allege unjust enrichment ""in the alternative"" to their copyright infringement claims does not save Count 
VII from dismissal. ""The relevant question is whether Plaintiffs could bring their claims under the copyright law at all, not whether 
they will, nor even whether they will ultimately prevail [**129]  on their copyright claim."" Moser Pilon Nelson Architects, LLC v. 
HNTB Corp., 05 Civ. 422, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 58334, 2006 WL 2331013, at *11 (D. Conn. Aug. 8, 2006) (emphasis in 
original) (granting summary judgment on unjust enrichment claim ""plead in the alternative"" to claim of copyright infringement on 
preemption grounds); see also Atrium Grp., 565 F. Supp. 2d at 510 (alternatively plead unjust enrichment claim based on same 
theory as copyright claim preempted and dismissed, as HN66[
] ""Rule 8(d)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure does not purport to override § 301 preemption.""); Eliya, Inc. v. Kohls Dep't Stores, 06 Civ. 195, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 66637, 2006 WL 
2645196, at *13 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 13, 2006) (""[P]leading a claim in the alternative does not resuscitate an otherwise unviable 
claim. Regardless of whether Eliya's statutory copyright claim has merit, its common law copyright claim asserts rights in 'the 
general scope of copyright' and therefore, win or lose, those rights are 'governed exclusively by' the Copyright Act. 17 U.S.C. § 
301(a). Accordingly, Eliya's common law copyright claim will be dismissed.""); Katz Dochrermann & Epstein, Inc. v. Home Box 
Office, 97 Civ. 7763, 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3971, 1999 WL 179603, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 31, 1999) (""The [unjust enrichment] 
claim is dismissed . . . as an alternative ground for recovery on KDE's copyright infringement and unfair competition claims.""). In 
any event, none of the case law cited by Plaintiffs discusses ""alternative"" pleading or supports their contentions. [**130]  Levine 
v. Landy, 832 F. Supp. 2d 176 (N.D.N.Y. 2011), presented a situation not at issue here, where the plaintiff alleged infringement 
with respect to some works and unjust enrichment with respect to others (for which the uses were conceded by plaintiff to have 
been authorized), and the court addressed only the issue of Copyright Act preemption, not alternative pleading. Levine, 832 F. 
Supp. 2d at 187-88. The court was never presented with the issue of whether an unjust enrichment claim is precluded by the 
existence of valid and enforceable contracts. In Astroworks, Inc. v. Astroexhibit, Inc., 257 F. Supp. 2d 609 (S.D.N.Y. 2003), 
Copyright Act preemption was not implicated; the court simply determined that because the existence of a contract could not be 
determined absent discovery, an unjust enrichment claim could survive the motion to dismiss stage. Astroworks, 257 F. Supp. 
2d at 620-21. Additionally, Plaintiffs assertion that ""even if AP is correct that it was technically authorized to grant a complimentary, royalty-
free, and retroactive license to the NFL, it was still unjustly enriched because it had an obligation in equity to obtain 
compensation for Plaintiffs or share with them the benefits of its bargain with the NFL"" is unsupported by case law - Plaintiffs cite "
413,," no authority that establishes that they can maintain a separate unjust enrichment claim even if all of the [**131]  uses of their 
photos were authorized. (See Pls.' Opp'n to AP Mot. 41.) "
418,1," The first motion to amend also included a request for a preliminary injunction requiring the Defendants to hold their assets 
separate during the pendency of the case. At the hearing on the first motion, the Plaintiffs clarified that they were not seeking 
such preliminary injunctive relief, notwithstanding the language of the proposed amended complaint. Feb. 13 Hr'g Tr. 35:11—
38:11, 45:7—13 (ECF No. 100)."
418,2," The modifications regarding divestiture addressed the settlement between the Department of Justice (the ""DOJ"") and the 
airlines in the DOJ's antitrust action, which occurred after the filing of the Plaintiffs' original complaint. See Fjord, 502 B.R. at 30. "
419,3," The memorandum of law in support of the second motion to amend was only eight pages, consisting largely of boilerplate 
language (ECF No. 105—1)."
419,4," The PSASC provides no new allegations regarding the following Plaintiffs other than their respective addresses: Katherine R. 
Arcell, Keith Dean Bradt, Jose M. Brito, Robert D. Conway, Judy Crandall, Pamela Faust, Gabriel Garavanian, Harry 
Garavanian, Lee M. Gentry, Gail S. Kosach, Michael C. Malaney, Len Marazzo, Lisa McCarthy, Patricia Ann Meeuwsen, L. West 
Oehmig, Jr., Cynthia Prosterman, Dana L. Robinson, Bill Rubinsohn, Sylvia N. Sparks, June Stansbury, Clyde D. Stensrud, 
Wayne Taleff, Gary Talewsky, Annette M. Tippetts, Diana Lynn Ultican, J. Michael Walker, and Christine O. Whalen. At the hearing on the Motion, the Court asked Plaintiffs' counsel whether there were additional allegations regarding personal 
injuries. July 17 Hr'g Tr. 76:2—20 (ECF No. 113). Plaintiffs' counsel explained that all forty individuals have likely [**7]  suffered 
personal injuries. See id. at 76:19—20 (""I believe, Your Honor, that all, most, if not all, would be [alleging] both.""). But when 
Plaintiffs' counsel could not point to specific paragraphs at the hearing, the Court suggested filing a letter after the hearing to 
highlight the personal injuries alleged by the Plaintiffs. The Plaintiffs submitted a letter to chambers, but many of the injuries 
described in the letter pertain to the Plaintiffs who were ""undescribed"" in the proposed supplemental complaint. (ECF No. 114). 
In any event, the allegations of the PSASC are the relevant touchstone for this Motion."
419,5," There is one other Plaintiff who alleges a harm that is less clearly a personal injury: Ms. Pulfer bought her children tickets for 
their honeymoon to St. Lucia. PSASC ¶¶ 205—12. Additionally, several Plaintiffs allege prospective injuries that may or may not 
occur. See, e.g., PSASC ¶¶ 289—90 (discussing expectation of Plaintiffs that the USAir Vacation practice of paying travel agent 
commissions will be terminated and the impact this would have on Ms. Davis). "
421,6," As previously noted by [**14]  the Court, ""the Plaintiffs' jury demand rests upon their proposed new treble damages claim"" and 
therefore is contingent on whether the PSASC asserts a sufficient basis for the treble damages allegedly suffered by the 
individual Plaintiffs. Fjord, 506 B.R. at 373. "
422,7," The requirement to identify a relevant product market is the same across many antitrust statutes. See City of New York v. Grp. 
Health Inc., 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 60196, 2010 WL 2132246, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. May 11, 2010), aff'd, 649 F.3d 151 (2d Cir. 2011) 
(""To state claims under any of the statutes identified above [the Clayton Act, the Sherman Act or the Donnelly Act], Plaintiffs 
must identify the product market in which competition will be impaired."") [**16]  (collecting cases); see also Kaplan v. Burroughs 
Corp., 611 F.2d 286, 292 n.2 (9th Cir. 1979) (citing 15 U.S.C. § 18) (""Generally, principles of market definition applicable to 
cases arising under Sherman Two are also applicable to Sherman One actions, and to merger cases arising under [Section] 7 of 
the Clayton Act.""); Lektro-Vend Corp. v. The Vendo Corp., 500 F. Supp. 332, 349 (N.D. Ill. 1980). For this reason, the Court cites 
to cases arising under these statutes in addition to those under Section 7 of the Clayton Act."
422,8," Similarly, the Motion states merely that ""Plaintiffs allege that they bought airline tickets and ancillary services from the 
defendants after the merger at the higher prices which were predicted to result from the lessening of competition caused by the 
merger."" Pls.' Mem. of Law at 12 (ECF No. 106—1)."
422,9," By contrast, the DOJ dedicated [**17]  almost three pages of its significantly shorter complaint to define the relevant product 
and geographic markets. See DOJ Compl. ¶¶ 24—31. The DOJ alleged that scheduled air passenger service was the relevant 
product market and that city-pairs were the relevant geographic market. Id. "
423,10," In Group Health Inc., the City of New York sued several insurance providers under the Clayton Act, the Sherman Act, and 
the [**19]  Donnelly Act, seeking to prevent them from merging. See Grp. Health, 649 F.3d at 154. The City's complaint defined 
the relevant market as the ""low-cost municipal health benefits market"" which included ""only those insurance plans that are 
inexpensive and that the City selects for inclusion in the Health Benefits Program."" Id. The Court of Appeals for the Second 
Circuit found that that the market alleged in the City's complaint was ""legally insufficient because it [was] defined by the City's 
preferences, not according to the rule of reasonable interchangeability and cross-elasticity of demand."" Id. at 156. The Court of 
Appeals noted that ""[t]he market alleged in the City's complaint ignores the competition existing among insurance providers for 
the City's business, as well as the health insurance market for other large employers in the region. The City does not allege an 
factor that would prevent insurance companies other than those it selects for the Health Benefits Program from proposing 
competitive products should the merged firm raise its premiums to supracompetitive prices."" Id."
423,11," The Plaintiffs allege that both USAir and American have stated that they compete only in a national market. See PSASC ¶¶ 
43—45. But this does not change the fact that the Plaintiffs must make appropriate allegations of a market for purposes of 
stating an antitrust complaint and the statements they cite are not determinative of the relevant market. See United States v. 
Oracle Corp., 331 F. Supp. 2d 1098, 1166 (N.D. Cal. 2004) (discounting statements in company's internal documents about 
competition where inconsistent with evidence in the marketplace); c.f. A.A. Poultry Farms, Inc. v. Rose Acre Farms, Inc., 881 
F.2d 1396, 1402 (7th Cir. 1989) (downplaying utility of statements of senior executives regarding competitive intent). "
424,12," Plaintiffs cite to items such as baggage fees and frequent flyer awards. See, e.g., PSASC ¶¶ 220. Policies for such items may 
be set at a national level, see, e.g., July 17 Hr'g Tr. 93:18—20, but they are not stand-alone products that are purchased without 
having first purchased an [**23]  airline ticket. In fact, the Plaintiffs characterize changes in these policies, such as increased 
baggage fees, as ""tantamount to fare increases . . . ."" PSASC ¶ 221."
424,13," At the time, the Court also observed that the ""Defendants have raised a legitimate question regarding why, even if a national 
market existed, such a market would not be deemed 'highly concentrated' using the prevailing industry [**24]  standards."" Fjord, 
502 B.R. at 40."
424,14," As courts have noted, submarkets are essentially their own product market for antitrust purposes. See Oracle, 331 F. Supp. 
2d at 1118-19 (discussing ""the rise (and fall) of the 'submarkets' doctrine."") "
425,15," Some discrepancies in price fluctuations are alleged in a way that makes comparison problematic. The price comparison for 
Ms. Russell, for example, compares one ticket purchased six months in advance against another ticket purchased only three 
months in advance, with one ticket for spring travel and the other for summer travel. PSASC ¶¶ 216—17."
425,16," Some allegations focus on specific airports within a city. See, e.g., PSASC ¶ 140 (discussing airport pair routes); ¶¶ 216—18 
(Ms. Russell purchased tickets from Dallas-Fort Worth to Fort Lauderdale). The Defendants argue that this is an impermissible "
426,," market as well, because [**30]  it ignores alternate airports that might be interchangeable. See Opp'n at 20. An airport-pair 
market may be very difficult to define because of interchangeability, although airline tickets are booked this way as a practical 
matter. But the Plaintiffs do not allege an airport market, or interchangeability and cross-elasticity for such a market. "
427,17," See also PSASC ¶¶ 347—51 (alleging that since the merger, American and USAir have begun to sell tickets to customers on 
the same planes, routes and departure times at substantially different fares, depending on which carrier the flight was booked 
through); PSASC ¶¶ 220—21 (discussing changes to baggage programs). "
437,1," Defendant Blue Sky Studios, Inc. has its principal place of business in Greenwich, CT, but Plaintiffs allege that it is owned by 
Twentieth Century Fox [**4]  Film Corporation, which has its principal place of business in Los Angeles, California. Consol. Am. 
Compl. (""CAC""), ¶ 21."
437,2," The Court grants Defendants' unopposed request for judicial notice, ECF No. 76, and has taken notice of the adjudicative facts 
contained therein. Defendants request that the Court take judicial notice of the Civil Investigative Demands issued by the 
Department of Justice; public records from the State of Delaware; the expert report of Edward E. Leamer, as filed in In re High-
Tech Antitrust Litig., Case No. 11-CV-2509-LHK, ECF No. 856-8; media articles regarding the DOJ investigation; and an 
advertisement published by Plaintiffs' counsel. See United States ex rel. Robinson Rancheria Citizens Council v. Borneo, Inc., 
971 F.2d 244, 248 (9th Cir. 1992) (holding a court may take notice of proceedings in other courts); Lee v. City of Los Angeles, 
250 F.3d 668, 689—90 (9th Cir. 2001) (matters of public record); MGIC Indem. Co. v. Weisman, 803 F.2d 500, 505 (9th Cir. 
1986) (court records); Von Saher v. Norton Simon Museum of Art at Pasadena, 592 F.3d 954, 960 (9th Cir. 2010), overruled 
on other grounds by Galbraith v. Cnty. of Santa Clara, 307 F.3d 1119, 1125—26 (9th Cir. 2002) (media publications); see also 
Fed. R. Evid. 201(d). The Court grants Plaintiffs' unopposed [**5]  request for judicial notice, ECF No. 97 at 37, and has taken notice of the 
adjudicative facts contained therein. Plaintiffs request that the Court take judicial notice of two sealing orders from the High-Tech 
litigation and a media report. See Lee, 250 F.3d at 689—90; Von Saher, 592 F.3d at 960. "
438,3," Plaintiffs aver that Industrial Light & Magic (""ILM"") is a division of Lucasfilm."
438,4," According to Plaintiffs, ILM, Lucasfilm, and Pixar have been owned by Defendant The Walt Disney Company since 2012. CAC 
¶¶ 25—26."
438,5," Disney also ""oversees the operations of"" Walt Disney Animation Studios, formerly known as Walt Disney Feature Animation. 
CAC ¶ 29."
438,6," Plaintiffs also allege that ""[t]he members of the Settlement Class under the September 20, 2013 Settlement Agreement with 
Pixar and Lucasfilm [in High-Tech] . . . do not bring in this complaint any claims against Pixar, Lucasfilm, and Disney that were 
released pursuant to the Settlement Agreement."" Id. ¶ 114. "
440,7," Defendants submit that Exhibit F in their request for judicial notice, consisting of Certificates of Corporate Formation and 
Amendment filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, Division of Corporations, disproves Plaintiffs' allegation 
that ImageMovers LLC was a party to the joint venture that created ImageMovers Digital. See ECF No. 76. Plaintiffs voluntarily 
dismissed ImageMovers LLC from this action after [**15]  Defendants filed their motion to dismiss and request for judicial notice. 
Consequently, the Court concludes that ImageMovers' involvement in the purported joint venture is not relevant. "
441,8," Plaintiffs dismissed ImageMovers LLC without prejudice pursuant to a tolling agreement on January 14, 2015. ECF No. 83."
441,9, Plaintiffs also dismissed Digital Domain 3.0 without prejudice pursuant to a tolling agreement. See CAC at 16 n.3. 
445,10," As Defendants note, HN7[
] under California law the general accrual rule is the ""last element rule,"" where a claim accrues 
""'when [it] is complete with all of its elements'—those elements being wrongdoing, harm, and causation."" Pooshs v. Philip Morris 
USA, Inc., 51 Cal. 4th 788, 797, 123 Cal. Rptr. 3d 578, 250 P.3d 181 (2011) (quoting Norgart v. Upjohn Co., 21 Cal. 4th 383, 
397, 87 Cal. Rptr. 2d 453, 981 P.2d 79 (1999)). The ""discovery rule"" is an exception to the common law accrual rule. Id. In light 
of the fact that the discovery rule is an exception and not the default rule, the Aryeh court's holding that federal 
interpretation [**32]  of the Sherman Act is instructive in interpreting the Cartwright Act, and the absence of any contrary 
argument from Plaintiffs, the Court focuses on the Sherman Act to resolve whether both Plaintiffs' Sherman and Cartwright Act 
claims are time barred. See Aryeh v. Canon Bus. Solutions, Inc., 55 Cal. 4th 1185, 1196, 151 Cal. Rptr. 3d 827, 292 P.3d 871 
(2013). Moreover, as stated above, the parties do not dispute that resolution of Plaintiffs' Sherman Act claim would also resolve 
Plaintiffs' Cartwright Act claim. "
447,11," Plaintiffs cite this Court's order in Plumlee v. Pfizer, No. 13-CV-414-LHK, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 23172, 2014 WL 695024, at 
*8 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 21, 2014), for the proposition that the delayed discovery rule applies to UCL claims as a matter of law. 
However, the UCL claims at issue in Plumlee were based on alleged fraudulent misrepresentations to consumers, precisely the 
type of UCL claim the Aryeh court recognized might be subject to the delayed discovery rule. [**39]  See Aryeh, 55 Cal. 4th at 
1195—96. Thus in the fraud context, the Court observed that under Aryeh, the delayed discovery rule was ""available to toll the 
statute of limitations"" for a UCL claim. The Court did not hold that the discovery rule applied to all UCL claims. See 2014 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 23172, [WL] at *8 n.6 (emphasis added). "
448,12," The Court notes that Defendants contend that Blue Sky was not named in the first-filed complaint, the Nitsch complaint, but 
rather [**40]  was only named on September 17, 2014 in the Wentworth complaint. See MTD at 4 n.3. "
450,13," Plaintiffs also neglect to mention that the Ninth Circuit in Oliver explicitly held that the four year statute of limitation in 15 
U.S.C. § 15b did not apply to the plaintiffs' claims, as they sought only injunctive relief. 751 F.3d at 1084."
450,14," While Plaintiffs are correct that the Ninth Circuit overruled Santa Maria in Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, 272 F.3d 1176,1194—95 
(9th Cir. 2001), the Ninth Circuit did so on other grounds. In Socop-Gonzales, the Ninth Circuit held that Santa Maria's 
suggestion that ""courts should not apply equitable tolling in situations where a plaintiff discovers the existence of a claim before 
the end of a limitations period and the court believes that the plaintiff reasonably could have been expected to bring a claim 
within the remainder of the limitations period,"" was contrary to Supreme Court precedent. Id. The Socop-Gonzales court did not, however, overrule the general proposition that HN20[
] fraudulent concealment requires 
some affirmative acts of misconduct ""above and beyond"" the conduct inherent to the underlying [**51]  claims themselves. The 
""above and beyond"" language has been cited by the Ninth Circuit approvingly in subsequent cases as an element of fraudulent "
451,," concealment claims. See, e.g., Guerrero, 442 F.3d at 706—07; Lukovsky v. City and Cnty. of San Francisco, 535 F.3d 1044, 
1052 (9th Cir. 2008); Coppinger-Martin v. Solis, 627 F.3d 745, 751 (9th Cir. 2010). "
452,15," Plaintiffs, in their opposition, raise for the first time the claim that some of the Defendants' requests to seal certain information 
in the High-Tech litigation constituted affirmative efforts to conceal information. As this theory [**57]  is not pled anywhere in the 
CAC, the Court declines to entertain this new argument. See Barnes v. Campbell Soup Co., No. 12-05185, 2013 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 118225, 2013 WL 5530017, at *2 (N.D. Cal. July 25, 2013)."
452,16," The Court notes that Defendants request that the Court dismiss or strike Plaintiffs' claim for wage-fixing in the event that the 
Court does not grant their motion to dismiss. MTD at 18 n.21. That request is denied. Moreover, the Court is concerned by 
Defendants' contention that ""the claim regarding wage-fixing . . . . should not proceed into the discovery phase."" Id. The Court 
has not stayed discovery in this action, and at the initial case management conference on November 5, 2014, [**58]  the Court 
explicitly denied both Plaintiffs' request to expedite discovery and Defendants' request to stay discovery. ECF No. 39. To the 
extent Plaintiffs have properly served discovery requests to Defendants regarding Plaintiffs' wage-fixing claims, Defendants must 
promptly respond. "
457,1," The District Court [**2]  had jurisdiction under 15 U.S.C. § 15(a) and 28 U.S.C. § 1331. We have appellate jurisdiction under 28 
U.S.C. § 1292(e) and Rule 23(f). HN1[
] We review the grant of class certification for an abuse of discretion, which occurs if the 
certification ""rests upon a clearly erroneous finding of fact, an errant conclusion of law or an improper application of law to fact."" 
In re Hydrogen Peroxide Antitrust Litig., 552 F.3d 305, 312 (3d Cir. 2008) (citation omitted). ""Whether an incorrect legal standard 
has been used is an issue of law to be reviewed de novo."" Id. (alteration and citation omitted)."
457,2," The District Court's Memorandum provides a more detailed description of the alleged facts in this case. See In re Blood 
Reagents Antitrust Litig., 283 F.R.D. 222 (E.D. Pa. 2012)."
457,3," During the 1980s and 1990s, the traditional blood reagent market was highly competitive. Faced with more than a dozen 
competing companies and low profit margins, Ortho considered abandoning the industry while Immucor approached bankruptcy. 
At some point in the 1990s, Immucor began to acquire competing producers and by 1999, Immucor and Ortho were the only 
remaining firms in the U.S. market. "
458,4," More specifically, Ortho contends that plaintiffs' expert's methodologies cannot prove antitrust impact as a matter of law 
because they are incapable of distinguishing lawful price increases resulting from the creation of a duopoly from price increases 
resulting from the alleged price-fixing conspiracy. Ortho bases this argument in part on statements in [**6]  Comcast such as, 
""Prices whose level above what an expert deems 'competitive' has been caused by factors unrelated to an accepted theory of 
antitrust harm are not 'anticompetitive' in any sense relevant here,"" 133 S. Ct. at 1435, and the suggestion that a damages 
model must be able ""to bridge the differences between supra-competitive prices in general and supra-competitive prices 
attributable to"" the antitrust violation, id. See also, e.g., id. at 1433 (stating that ""a model purporting to serve as evidence of 
damages . . . must measure only those damages attributable to"" the ""theory of antitrust impact accepted for class-action 
treatment,"" and those damages must be ""susceptible of measurement across the entire class""); id. at 1435 (""The first step in a 
damages study is the translation of the legal theory of the harmful event into an analysis of the economic impact of that event.'"" 
(quoting Federal Judicial Center, Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence 432 (3d ed. 2011))). "
459,5," See generally [**8]  Comcast, 133 S. Ct. at 1433-35."
459,6, See supra note 4 and accompanying text.
459,7," Similarly, HN3[
] ""[u]nder the present structure of Rule 23(c), . . . a district court [is] no longer permitted to issue a 'conditional certification' . . . because [a] trial court must 'make a definitive determination that the requirements of Rule 23 have been met 
before certifying a class.'"" In re NFL Players Concussion Injury Litig., 775 F.3d 570, 580, 2014 WL 7331936, at *6 (3d Cir. 2014) 
(third alteration in original) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Hydrogen Peroxide, 552 F.3d at 320)."
459,8," We have no occasion to examine whether there might be some variation between the Seventh and Eighth Circuit formulations. 
Consistent with our holding here, HN6[
] both courts limit the Daubert inquiry to expert testimony offered to prove satisfaction 
of Rule 23's requirements. See Zurn Pex, 644 F.3d at 614 (approving the district court's ""focused Daubert analysis which "
460,," scrutinized the reliability of the expert testimony in light of the criteria for class certification and the current state of the 
evidence""); Messner, 669 F.3d at 814 (""[A] Daubert hearing is necessary under American Honda only if the witness's opinion is 
'critical' to class certification.""); Am. Honda, 600 F.3d at 816 (holding that a trial court must resolve challenges to an expert's 
qualifications as well as ""any challenge to the reliability of information provided by an expert if that information is relevant to 
establishing any of the Rule 23 requirements for class certification"")."
460,9," Plaintiffs contend Ortho waived the opportunity to bring a Daubert challenge. But in the trial court proceedings, Ortho 
consistently challenged the reliability of plaintiffs' expert's models and the sufficiency of his testimony to satisfy Rule 23(b)(3)."
460,10," As we explained in Hydrogen Peroxide, HN7[
] [O]pinion testimony should not be uncritically accepted as establishing a Rule 23 requirement merely because the court holds the testimony should not be excluded, under Daubert or for any other reason. Under Rule 23 the district court 
must be ""satisfied,"" Falcon, 457 U.S. [147,] 161, 102 S. Ct. 2364, 72 L. Ed. 2d 740 [(1982)], or ""persuaded,"" [In re Initial 
Pub. Offering Sec. Litig.], 471 F.3d [24,] 41 [(2d Cir. 2006)], that each requirement is met before certifying a class. Like any 
evidence, admissible expert opinion may persuade its audience, or it may not. This point is especially important to bear in 
mind when a party opposing certification offers expert opinion. The district court may be persuaded by the testimony of 
either (or neither) party's expert with respect to whether a certification requirement is met. Weighing conflicting expert 
testimony at the certification stage is not only permissible; it may be integral to the rigorous analysis Rule 23 demands. Hydrogen Peroxide, 552 F.3d at 323 (citations and footnote omitted). See also generally id. at 324 (HN8[
] ""That weighing 
expert opinions is proper does not make it necessary in every case or unlimited in scope. . . . In its sound discretion, a district 
court may find it unnecessary to consider certain expert opinion with respect to a certification requirement, [**13]  but it may not 
decline to resolve a genuine legal or factual dispute because of concern for an overlap with the merits.""). "
473,1," Plaintiffs alternate between referring to this alleged agreement as the ""Restrictive Hiring Agreement"" and the ""Restricted Hiring 
Agreement."" The Court will refer to the agreement as the ""restricted hiring agreement,"" other than when quoting Plaintiffs' 
inconsistent usage. "
475,2," The Court GRANTS Defendant's unopposed request for judicial notice and has taken judicial notice of the adjudicative facts 
contained therein. See ECF No. 33. Defendants request that the Court take judicial notice of documents issued by the 
Department of Justice; public records; and media articles regarding the DOJ investigation. See United States ex rel. Robinson 
Rancheria Citizens Council v. Borneo, Inc., 971 F.2d 244, 248 (9th Cir. 1992) (holding [*12]  a court may take notice of 
proceedings in other courts); Lee v. City of Los Angeles, 250 F.3d 668, 689-90 (9th Cir. 2001), overruled on other grounds by 
Galbraith v. Cnty. of Santa Clara, 307 F.3d 1119, 1125-26 (9th Cir. 2002) (matters of public record); MGIC Indem. Co. v. 
Weisman, 803 F.2d 500, 505 (9th Cir. 1986) (court records); Von Saher v. Norton Simon Museum of Art at Pasadena, 592 
F.3d 954, 960 (9th Cir. 2010) (media publications); see also Fed. R. Evid. 201(d). "
477,3," As the Ninth Circuit explained in Manetti-Farrow, Inc. v. Gucci Am., Inc, 858 F.2d 509, 514 n.4 (9th Cir. 1988), ""an agreement 
to arbitrate is actually a specialized forum selection clause,"" and the analysis of one is therefore applicable to the analysis of the 
other. "
486,4, Plaintiffs fail to mention that neither Oliver nor Samsung involved California Business & Professions Code § 16600 claims. 
509,*," Honorable Robert L. Hinkle, United States District Judge for the Northern District of Florida, sitting by designation. [**2] "
510,1," In particular, the American [**5]  Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (""ARRA""), Pub. L. No. 111-5, 123 Stat. 115, 
provided more than $6 billion to fund water infrastructure projects, all with domestic-only specifications. Pennsylvania and New 
Jersey state laws also require domestic materials in public projects, as do Air Force bases, certain federal programs, and 
various municipalities. See, e.g., 73 P.S. § 1884, 1886; N.J. Stat. Ann. § 52:33-3; McWane, Inc. (McWane I), 155 F.T.C. 903, 
994-95, 2013 FTC LEXIS 76 (2013)."
510,2," McWane emphasizes that the policy deliberately used the words ""may"" and ""or"" to convey ""a weak stance."" However, 
McWane's Vice President and General Manager Richard Tatman recognized [**8]  that ""[a]lthough the words 'may' and 'or' were 
specifically used, the market has interpreted the communication in the more hard line 'will' sense."" "
511,3," McWane maintains that this was the only example of the Full Support Program's enforcement: ""McWane never enforced the 
rebate program against any other distributor."" Of course, the goal of the program was not necessarily to enforce the 
punishments but to dissuade customers from leaving McWane in the first place. "
512,4," In a series of events irrelevant to the resolution of this appeal, Sigma entered the domestic fittings market as an authorized 
distributor of McWane's domestic fittings. See McWane II, 2014 FTC LEXIS 28, 2014 WL 556261, at *10-11."
512,5," Counts 1, 2, and 3 alleged an earlier conspiracy among McWane, Sigma, and Star to stabilize prices in the non-domestic 
fittings market. Counts 4 and 5 alleged that McWane's distribution agreement with Sigma violated the Federal Trade 
Commission Act. Count 7 alleged that the same conduct targeted in Count 6 amounted to attempted monopolization."
512,6, The ALJ dismissed counts 1-3 but ruled in favor of the complaint counsel on counts 4-7.
512,7," The Commission dismissed the other six counts. As to Count 7, attempted monopolization, the Commission deemed it 
""unnecessary to ask whether McWane attempted to monopolize the market"" since it had found that McWane had actually done 
so. McWane II, 2014 FTC LEXIS 28, 2014 WL 556261, at *31 n.16. "
513,8," Former FTC Commissioner Rosch -- whom Commissioner Wright replaced on the Commission in January 2013 -- had issued 
similar criticisms in his dissents at both the pleading and summary judgment stages of the case. "
514,9," In Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc), this Court adopted as binding precedent all 
decisions of the old Fifth Circuit handed down prior to October 1, 1981. A recent opinion of this Court stated that we review the FTC's finding of market definition for ""clear error."" Polypore Int'l, 686 
F.3d at 1217. Clear error is the traditional standard used to review a district court's factual [**20]  findings, and we employ it in 
reviewing a finding of market definition by a district court judge. See, e.g., United States v. Engelhard Corp., 126 F.3d 1302, 
1305 (11th Cir. 1997); Cable Holdings of Ga., Inc. v. Home Video, Inc., 825 F.2d 1559, 1563 (11th Cir. 1987); Nat'l Bancard 
Corp. (NaBanco) v. VISA U.S.A., Inc., 779 F.2d 592, 604 (11th Cir. 1986). Polypore drew its ""clear error"" language from just 
such a case. 686 F.3d at 1217 (citing Engelhard, 126 F.3d at 1305). But substantial evidence, not clear error, is the ""traditional . . 
. standard used by courts to review agency decisions."" Am. Tower LP v. City of Huntsville, 295 F.3d 1203, 1207 (11th Cir. 2002). 
Indeed, Polypore itself noted the correct standard of review for the FTC's factual findings earlier in the opinion. See 686 F.3d at 
1213. Other circuits follow this distinction, reviewing the FTC's market definition finding for substantial evidence while reviewing a 
district court's market definition finding for clear error. Compare, e.g., Olin Corp. v. FTC, 986 F.2d 1295, 1297-98 (9th Cir. 1993) 
(reviewing FTC's market definition for substantial evidence), and ProMedica Health Sys., Inc. v. FTC, 749 F.3d 559, 566 (6th Cir. 
2014) (same), petition for cert. filed, No. 14-762 (Dec. 30, 2014), with, e.g., JBL Enters., Inc. v. Jhirmack Enters., Inc., 698 F.2d 
1011, 1016 (9th Cir. 1983) (reviewing district court's market definition for clear error), and United States v. Cent. State Bank, 817 
F.2d 22, 24 (6th Cir. 1987) (per curiam) (same). Moreover, Polypore's language cannot be squared with the old Fifth Circuit's approach in Jim Walter. In that case, the Court 
asked ""whether there is substantial evidence to support the FTC's finding of a national market for tar and asphalt roofing 
products."" 625 F.2d at 683. After determining that the FTC's market definition was founded ""primarily [**21]  on the casual 
observations of industry representatives and an economist,"" the Court held that the FTC's proposed market was ""not supported 
by substantial evidence"" and remanded ""for reconsideration of the appropriate . . . market."" Id. Jim Walter plainly held that the 
FTC's market definition is reviewed for substantial evidence. Although Polypore may be read to say otherwise, in the case of an 
intra-circuit conflict, the earlier case is binding. See Morrison v. Amway Corp., 323 F.3d 920, 929 (11th Cir. 2003). "
515,10," The Commission acknowledged that violations of Section 2 of the Sherman Act (monopolization) also constitute ""unfair 
methods of competition"" under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, and therefore relied on Section 2 caselaw in its 
analysis. See McWane II, 2014 FTC LEXIS 28, 2014 WL 556261, at *11 n.7 (citing Cal. Dental Ass'n v. FTC, 526 U.S. 756, 762, 
119 S. Ct. 1604, 143 L. Ed. 2d 935 & n.3 (1999); FTC v. Motion Picture Adver. Serv. Co., 344 U.S. 392, 394-95, 73 S. Ct. 361, 
97 L. Ed. 426, 49 F.T.C. 1730 (1953)); see also William Holmes & Melissa Mangiaracina, Antitrust Law Handbook § 7:2 (2014) 
(""For the most part . . . the [Federal Trade Commission Act] has been held coterminous with the Sherman and Clayton Acts.""). 
Both parties (and the dissenting Commissioner) agree that this is the correct [**26]  analytical approach. "
518,11," It is worth noting, however, that the defendant in Tops Markets had a lower market share than McWane -- 74% as opposed to 
over 90% -- and the plaintiffs ""failed to produce any . . . evidence to rebut [the defendant's] assertion"" that the market contained "
519,," no barriers to entry. 142 F.3d at 99. In this case, as we noted, the complaint alleged and the Commission found significant entry 
barriers. "
545,1," The Eighth Circuit has recognized a third method of analysis, the ""quick look,"" which is closer on the analysis spectrum to the 
per se analysis, but neither party has argued its application here. See Craftsmen Limousine, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 491 F.3d 
380 (8th Cir. 2007). "
548,2," Plaintiffs' response states: ""The Memphis TN-MS-AR Metropolitan Statistical Area includes Fayette, Shelby and Tipton 
Counties in Tennessee; Benton, DeSoto, Marshall, Tate and Tunica Counties in Mississippi; and Crittenden County, Arkansas."" 
(Docket No. 60, p. 14). "
553,1," The fact that some of the conclusions on remand restate and summarize the court of appeals' conclusions is of no moment in 
the determination of necessity. See Yamaha Corp. of Am. v. United States, (D.C. Cir. 1992) 961 F.2d 245, 254, 295 U.S. App. 
D.C. 158 (“In issue preclusion, it is the prior [*12]  judgment that matters, not the court's opinion explicating the judgment. ‘Even 
in the absence of any opinion, a judgment bars re-litigation of an issue necessary to the judgment.’” [quoting Am. Iron & Steel 
Inst, v. EPA, (D.C. Cir. 1989) 886 F.2d 390, 397, 280 U.S. App. D.C. 373]. "
582,1," Unless otherwise indicated, all ECF references are from the docket of No. 14-04592 in the Northern District of California. "
585,2," The Court GRANTS the parties' unopposed requests for judicial notice. ECF Nos. 18, 22. The Court may take notice of facts 
not subject to reasonable dispute that are ""capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy 
cannot reasonably be questioned."" Fed. R. Evid. 201(b). Oracle asks the Court to take judicial notice of certain documents filed 
publicly in other proceedings. See Reyn's Pasta Bella, LLC v. Visa USA, Inc., 442 F.3d 741, 746 n.6 (9th Cir. 2006) (taking "
586,," judicial notice of documents filed in other courts). Plaintiff asks [*12]  the Court to take judicial notice of DOJ documents that are 
publicly available on government websites. See Daniels-Hall v. Nat'l Educ. Ass'n, 629 F.3d 992, 998-99 (9th Cir. 2010) (taking 
judicial notice of information on a publicly available government website). "
588,3," Federal antitrust law provides: Whenever any civil or criminal proceeding is instituted by the United States to prevent, restrain, or punish violations of any 
of the antitrust laws, but not including an action under section 15a of this title, the running of the statute of limitations in 
respect to every private or State right of action arising under said laws and based in whole or in part on any matter 
complained of in said proceeding shall be suspended during the pendency thereof and for one year thereafter."
588,15," U.S.C. § 16(i). Since the parties do not dispute that this provision extended the statute of limitations period to March 18, 
2012, and because the outcome is the same whether the limitations period expired in May 2011 or March 2012, the Court 
assumes without deciding that the parties are correct. "
599,1," ""Tooling"" (or ""tools and dies"") refers to metal dies used to manufacture metal goods. "
600,2," For the purposes of this case, the analysis of PBSI's § 2 claims extends to its claims under the Robinson-Patman Act, 15 
U.S.C. § 13(a)—(b). See Brooke Group Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 509 U.S. 209, 219, 221-22, 113 S. Ct. 2578, "

276 F.3d 900, 903-04 (6th Cir. 2002))."
601,3," HN6[
] The definition of a market for antitrust purposes has two components: ""the relevant [**11]  product market and the 
relevant geographic market."" E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. v. Kolon Indus., Inc., 637 F.3d 435, 441 (4th Cir. 2011). "
604,4," We do not mean to suggest that the court's method was a truly random sample used to make a statistical inference about a 
larger population. Rather, we use this term in the sense used in the Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(2) advisory committee notes. "
605,5," We also note that, in the case of predatory pricing, intent to harm competition itself can often accrue to the benefit of 
consumers. When a would-be predator sets its prices too low but later finds that it cannot recoup those losses, consumers have 
gained. Brooke Group Ltd., 509 U.S. at 223-24. Antitrust law should not pose an obstacle to this sort of inept predation. Id. at 
224. "
606,6," As the Fifth Circuit explains in more detail: It must be noted that the expert relied on an erroneous interpretation of the law regarding predatory pricing. The opinion 
clearly indicated that the expert [**28]  believed the law of this Circuit allowed a finding of predation when prices are above 
a firm's variable costs but below a ""short-run profit maximizing price."" As we explained above, this position is no longer 
tenable in the wake of Brooke Group. This error may explain, but does not excuse, the expert's failure to address the 
question of variable cost. In affirming summary judgment, we may disregard the conclusions of an expert opinion grounded 
in an error of law. Stearns Airport Equip. Co. v. FMC Corp., 170 F.3d 518, 533 n.14 (5th Cir. 1999). "
610,1," The Court SUSTAINS the objections of Netlist (Dkt. No. 452) and STRIKES the Declaration of Lou Marchant, Senior Solution 
Sales Executive for Lenovo (United States), Inc. (Dkt. No. 450-3), as well as the brief and Declaration of Steven J. Corr filed on 
behalf [*4]  of Non-parties SanDisk Corporation and Smart Storage Systems, Inc. (Dkt. No. 448, 449). "
611,2," The Court follows the ""desirable"" practice of refraining from ruling on a 50(a) motion until the jury has returned a verdict, in 
favor of a renewed 50(b) motion post-verdict. Therrell v. Georgia Marble Holdings Corp., 960 F.2d 1555, 1569 (11th Cir. 
1992) quoting 9 Charles A. Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 2533, at 586 (1971) (""the appellate 
courts have repeatedly said that it is usually desirable to take [*7]  a verdict, and then pass on the sufficiency of the evidence on 
a post-verdict motion""). The Court notes that no briefing or hearing schedule on the written Rule 50(a) motion was ever set, nor 
was one sought by Netlist. Remaining issues can be raised in a Rule 50(b) motion. "
615,1, Woodman's does not seek monetary damages in this case. 
619,1," Though Plaintiff also mentions N.J.S.A. 56:9-3 in its pleading, the New Jersey statute's language is virtually identical to the first 
statement of the Sherman Act, and each party's briefing analyzes Plaintiff's claims only under Section 1 of the Sherman Act. 
This Court therefore analyzes this count solely under Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1. "
621,2," As a preliminary matter, the Court rejects Defendant's argument that control over delivery of one's own product can never 
violate antitrust tying laws. The cases Defendant cites do not support that proposition. Rather, they simply hold that a company 
must have an economic interest in the alleged tie to violate tying laws. See Crawford Transp. Co. v. Chrysler Corp., 338 F.2d 
934, 939 (6th Cir. 1964) (Chrysler did not violate antitrust tying laws by requiring its cars to be shipped through approved 
shipping companies because it had no financial interest in and received no profit from the shipping companies); Venzie Corp. v. 
U.S. Mineral Prods. Co., 521 F.2d 1309, 1317-18 (3d Cir. 1975) (""The absence of a direct interest in the tied product market 
leaves open the possibility of a nonpredatory justification for requiring sales only through Armstrong and distinguishes this 
situation from the solely anti-competitive arrangements which have been branded as per se antitrust violations.""); Carl Sandburg 
Vill. Condo. Ass'n No. 1 v. First Condo. Dev. Co., 758 F.2d 203, 207 (7th Cir. 1985) (""[A]n illegal tying arrangement will not be 
found where the alleged tying company has absolutely no economic interest in the sales of the tied seller, whose products are 
favored by the tie-in.""). [*11]  Here, by contrast, Defendant has an economic interest. Defendant allegedly receives substantial 
remuneration from its policy—either a 10.5% fee for direct delivery or a 5% fee if a third party is used. Am. Compl. at 2 ¶ 5, 3 ¶ 7. 
Delivery of one's own product is not categorically exempt from antitrust laws. "
622,3," Any renewed pleading must provide facts which show consumer demand for delivery of educational materials independent 
from the materials' sale, such that it would be efficient for a firm to separate purchase of educational materials from their 
delivery."
622,4," Though Defendant also challenges the accuracy of Plaintiff's statistics concerning Defendant's market share, this is a factual 
dispute, and so is misplaced at this stage of the case. "
624,5," Count II, ""intentional interference with contract,"" and Count IV, ""tortious interference with contract,"" are pled almost identically 
and, insofar as is relevant to this opinion, appear to apply the same law. See Norwood-Jeb, L.L.C. v. N. River Mews Assocs., 
L.L.C., No. 1259-07T3, 2009 N.J. Super. Unpub. LEXIS 1558, 2009 WL 1010963, at *9 (N.J. Super. App. Div. Apr. 15, 
2009) [*18]  (analyzing an ""intentional interference with contract"" claim under ""tortious interference with contractual rights""). 
Plaintiff does not contest Defendant's characterization that these counts are identical, in law and in fact, so the Court analysis 
applies to both. "
627,1," Although Swanson is a pre-trial detainee, his Complaint is still subject to screening under the PLRA. Section 1915A(c) defines 
prisoner to include ""any person incarcerated or detained in any facility who is accused of, convicted of, sentenced for, or 
adjudicated delinquent for, violations of criminal law...."" "
634,1," This Memorandum does not provide a detailed explanation for the court's resolution of less significant disputes between the 
parties. These include the court's adoption of the Government's proposed definition of ""Merchant"" (see Permanent Injunction § 
I.M), adoption of the Government's proposed provision authorizing exclusive-steering agreements between Amex and merchants 
under certain circumstances (see Permanent Injunction §§ III.B.3, IV.D), adoption (as modified by the court) of American 
Express's proposed provision confirming its right to steer cardholders toward particular merchants (see Permanent Injunction § 
III.B.6), adoption (as modified by the court) of the Government's proposed provisions governing notice to merchants of the 
court's Decision and Permanent Injunction (see Permanent Injunction § IV.C), rejection of American Express's proposed 
definition of ""Rule"" (see Defs.' Proposed J. § I.22), rejection [*19]  of American Express's proposed provision regarding 
marketing benefits and other services (see Defs.' Proposed J. § III.B.6), and rejection of American Express's proposal that would 
have required merchants engaging in steering to provide notice to Amex (see Defs.' Proposed J. § III.B.9). Finally, the court 
notes that while it has drawn largely from the parties' proposals, it has also made its own additions and subtractions to the 
language, including adjustments to certain time periods. "
637,2," In addition, the court did not strike from the NDPs language that makes clear that American Express can require all merchants 
to indicate their acceptance of Amex whenever a customer affirmatively asks what forms of payment are accepted."
637,3," Of course, other sources of law outside of the scope of the Permanent Injunction, such as the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-
Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, may protect certain forms of steering to certain forms of 
payment. (See generally Decision at 30-31.) "
638,4," If American Express believes that merchants and/or consumers do not understand the true relative costs of accepting Amex 
credit cards compared to other credit cards, it is of course permitted to educate merchants and [*32]  consumers."
638,5," This is not the first case in which an antitrust injunction has covered a product not within the relevant market. See, e.g., Int'l 
Boxing Club of N.Y. v. United States, 358 U.S. 242, 262, 79 S. Ct. 245, 3 L. Ed. 2d 270 (1959) (upholding injunction that ""went 
beyond the relevant market which has been considered for purposes of determining the Sherman Act violations,"" because ""the "
639,," relief [] must be broader than the [relevant market] because the evil to be remedied is broader."" (internal quotation marks and 
alterations omitted)). Indeed, debit was included within the terms of the injunction in the Visa litigation, even though the court, 
like this one, determined that credit and debit comprised separate markets. See United States v. Visa U.S.A., Inc., 163 F. Supp. 
2d 322, 408 (S.D.N.Y. 2001) (""Moreover, including debit as a necessary part of the remedy does not put it in the same product 
market with general purpose cards.""). "
649,1," The other legal actions are relevant because depositions and a settlement offer from those cases include evidence that 
contradicts portions of Sukumar's testimony in this case. "
650,2," HN5[
] A plaintiff must possess standing as of the time the suit was filed. See Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 191, 120 S. Ct. 693, 145 L. Ed. 2d 610 (2000)."
650,3," Satisfaction of this competitive injury requirement, however, does not mean that a party necessarily has standing under § 
292(b). The statute also imposes a causation requirement. Standing under § 292(b) is limited to those who have suffered a 
competitive injury ""as a result of a violation of [section 292(a)]."" 35 U.S.C. § 292(b). "
651,4," Congress explicitly preserved the ability to seek a $500-per-article fine in § 292(a), but limited enforcement to the government. 
As such, the statute uses the threat of a government suit—rather than the previous mechanism of qui tam actions—to deter 
businesses from falsely marking their products. "
667,1," The factual background and procedural background in these consolidated antitrust cases was explained in depth in my prior 
Order, granting in part and denying in part defendants' prior motion to dismiss. November 17, 2014 Order [Dkt. No. 117] at 1-9. 
That discussion is incorporated into this Order. In this Order I will refer to brand name and generic Lidoderm patches as 
""Lidoderm"" or ""Lidoderm patches."" "
668,2," In my November 17, 2014 Order, some of the claims of the direct purchaser plaintiffs were also dismissed with leave to amend. 
The DPPs filed their Second Amended Complaint on December 19, 2014. Dkt. No. 121. Defendants have not moved to dismiss 
any claims asserted by the DPPs in their SAC."
668,3," Defendants challenge the following claims: EPPs' state antitrust and monopolization claims under Utah and Massachusetts 
law; GEHA's state antitrust and monopolization claims under Rhode Island and Massachusetts law; GEHA's [**29]  state 
consumer protection claims under 17 states' laws; and GEHA's unjust enrichment claims under 38 states' laws. "
669,4," At oral argument, the EPPs indicated that in addition to filing a Third Amended Complaint, they will also serve a demand letter 
on defendants in accordance with the statute."
669,5," GEHA voluntarily withdraws its claims under the New Hampshire Consumer Protection Act. GEHA Oppo. at 2, fn. 2. "
670,6," At the hearing, GEHA relied on a recent decision in In re Aggrenox Antitrust Litigation from the District Court of Connecticut, 
Case No. 14-md-2516 SRU. In that case, the court agreed that the Rhode Island repealer statute was not retroactive but then — 
in one sentence without any analysis of authority — held without explanation that indirect purchaser claims based on 
""overcharges incurred after"" the date the Rhode Island repealer statute was passed could continue. In absence of any 
persuasive analysis that supports the court's conclusion, I will not follow that case."
670,7," In California v. Infineon Technologies AG, 531 F. Supp. 2d 1124, 1142 (N.D. Cal. 2007), the court addressed Mylan and 
concluded that in light of the 2003 amendment to Alaska's antitrust statute, the Attorney General was only allowed to seek 
recovery for indirect purchasers under Alaska's consumer protection statute after the 2003 amendment. "
671,8," GEHA also argues, as the EPPs did on the prior motion to dismiss, that even if GEHA is considered to be engaged in ""trade or 
commerce,"" it can still pursue a Section 11 indirect [**39]  purchaser claim under the rationale of Blue Cross & Blue Shield v. 
AstraZeneca Pharms. LP (In re Pharm. Indus. Average Wholesale Price Litig.), 582 F.3d 156 (1st Cir. 2009). I specifically 
rejected that argument in my prior Order (Dkt. No. 117 at 42) and GEHA offers no persuasive reason why I should revisit that 
determination on this motion. "
672,9," GEHA's reliance on In re Processed Egg Prods. Antitrust Litig., 851 F. Supp. 2d 867, 898 (E.D. Pa. 2012) is misplaced, as that 
case does not discuss who is a ""consumer"" under the statute."
672,10," GEHA argues that defendants are ""implicitly"" challenging its consumer protection claim under Arizona law. GEHA Oppo. at 3, 
n. 9. However as defendants clarified at the hearing, they did not challenge the Arizona consumer [**43]  protection claim and, 
as such, GEHA may continue to pursue it. "
675,11," In support of its general argument that allegations of fraud before the PTO is sufficient to be actionable deception and fraud 
under state's consumer protection laws, GEHA relies on three cases: In re Suboxone (Buprenorphine Hydrochloride & 
Naloxone) Antitrust Litig., 64 F. Supp. 3d 665, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 167204, 1 (E.D. Pa. Dec. 3, 2014); In re DDAVP Indirect 
Purchaser Antitrust Litig. v. Ferring Pharms. Inc., 903 F. Supp. 2d 198, 224 (S.D.N.Y. 2012); Abbott Labs. v. Teva Pharms. USA, 
Inc., 432 F. Supp. 2d 408, 433 (D. Del. 2006). In each of these three cases, the courts found that allegations [**51]  that 
defendants committed fraud on the PTO, filed sham patent litigation and/or filed sham Citizen Petitions with the FDA were 
sufficient to remove the cases from the scope of preemption under the patent laws and Noerr-Pennington immunity for 
petitioning the government. However, none of those cases addressed Maine's UPTA and GEHA does not argue why the 
language of Maine's UPTA would be specifically covered by the rationale in any of these cases."
675,12," In State by Humphrey, the Minnesota Supreme Court addressed only Blue Cross's standing to sue for consumer [**53]  
protection and antitrust claims against tobacco companies on the theory that Blue Cross paid inflated costs due to the tobacco 
companies' conduct. Id. at 495-97. The allegations of deceptive conduct by the tobacco companies included that the tobacco 
companies illegally conspired to suppress research on the deleterious effects of smoking, manipulated nicotine levels in 
cigarettes, undertook a duty but failed to protect the public health by its assertions that it would cooperate with public health "
676,," authorities, and utilized false advertising. Id. at 492, 495. Those are starkly different allegations than the ""deception"" alleged in 
this case. "
679,13," The The 'In' Porters, S.A. v. Hanes Printables, Inc., 663 F. Supp. 494, 501 (M.D.N.C. 1987) court relied extensively on Am. 
Rockwool, Inc. v. Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp., 640 F. Supp. 1411, 1428 (E.D.N.C. 1986) for imposing a ""substantial"" injury 
requirement to determine whether the NCUDTPA could be asserted by the foreign plaintiff. The Am. Rockwool case determined 
whether North Carolina law could be applied by a plaintiff to seek recovery for ""multi-state conduct"" and not just acts occurring in 
North Carolina. Id. at 1428. None of those issues are involved in this case, where GEHA seeks to apply North Carolina law only 
to remedy injuries suffered in North Carolina."
679,14," See, e.g., Duke Energy Int'l, L.L.C. v. Napoli, 748 F. Supp. 2d 656, 677 (S.D. Tex. 2010) (dismissing NCUDTPA where plaintiff 
failed to explain how it ""experienced harm in North Carolina as a the result of the alleged wrongful conduct"" and failed to allege 
any harm to North Carolina consumers); In re Parmalat, 383 F. Supp. 2d 587, 603 (S.D.N.Y. 2005)(dismissing claim where 
plaintiff failed to allege any in-state injury); Merck & Co. Inc. v. Lyon, 941 F. Supp. 1443, 1463 (M.D.N.C. 1996) (dismissing claim 
where foreign plaintiffs failed to allege in-state injury); Dixie Yarns, Inc. v. Plantation Knits, Inc., No. 3:93CV301-P, 1994 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 21725, 1994 WL 910955, at *2 (W.D.N.C. July 12, 1994) (declining to apply NCUDTPA where unclear whether 
plaintiff suffered injury in North Carolina and defendants did not manufacture or sell their product in North Carolina)."
679,15," See In re Refrigerant Compressors Antitrust Litig., No. 2:09-MD-02042, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 50737, 2013 WL 1431756, at 
*19 (E.D. Mich. Apr. 9, 2013) (where ""alleged conspiracy caused manufacturers to pay inflated prices for compressors and, any 
retail customers who ultimately purchased finished products containing compressors paid an inflated price for those products,"" 
such effect is merely ""an incidental in-state injury"" absent allegations that defendants ""engaged in any wrongful conduct in North 
Carolina.""). "
680,16," GEHA voluntarily withdraws its unjust enrichment claims under Idaho and New [**66]  Jersey common law. GEHA Oppo. at 2, 
fn. 3. Here, GEHA has alleged in-state injury and that defendants' products were being sold in North Carolina. GEHA SAC ¶ 23. 
That is sufficient at this juncture to state a claim under the NCUDTPA."
680,17," Defendants also argue that to the extent GEHA's claims are ""parasitic"" unjust enrichment claims — claims which rely on a 
violation of a state's antitrust or consumer protection statutes — then those claims must fail where GEHA has failed to 
adequately plead a claim under either [**68]  the antitrust or consumer protection statutes of those states. In its opposition brief, 
GEHA clarifies that the unjust enrichment claims it intends to pursue are ""autonomous"" claims that are not tethered to its 
allegations of antitrust or consumer protection violations. GEHA Oppo. at 15-16."
680,18, The unjust enrichment claims DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE on this basis are Alabama and Arkansas. 
681,19," The In re Auto Parts court also relied [**70]  on a district court case from Arizona, Yee v. Nat'l Gypsum Co., 2010 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 61488 (D. Ariz. June 22, 2010), which dismissed an unjust enrichment claim absent an allegation that plaintiff conferred 
some benefit on defendant — the manufacturer of a product plaintiff indirectly purchased. Id. at * 12. However, there was no 
discussion of a need for that benefit to have been conferred ""directly"" to the defendant from plaintiff. "
683,20," The Aftermarket and Flonase cases relied on two North Carolina Court of Appeals decisions: Effler v. Pyles, 94 N.C. App. 349, 
380 S.E.2d 149, 152 (N.C. Ct. App. 1989) and Baker Constr. Co., Inc. v. City of Burlington, 200 N.C. App. 435, 683 S.E.2d

683,21," See Apache Corp. v. MDU Res. Grp., Inc., 1999 ND 247, 603 N.W.2d 891, 895 (N.D. 1999). "
690,1, A copy of this letter was not attached to Hemlock's complaint. 
693,2," Kaiser Steel also argued that the agreement was illegal under the National Labor Relations Act, but the Court's adjudication of 
that argument is not germane to the present case so discussion of it has been omitted. "
694,3," The opinion does not make clear whether only the first and second franchisees—the museums that were obligated to acquire 
wax figures from the franchisor or supplier, respectively—or all franchisees challenged the agreements. It would appear that only 
the first franchisee, or possibly just the first and second franchisee, would have standing to challenge the agreements since 
there is no reference in the opinion to the fact that the third franchisee's franchise agreement contained any requirements that 
the third franchise museum acquire wax figures from the franchisor or the supplier. While the opinion is not clear on this point, it 
is not material to the discussion of the District of Columbia Circuit's analysis. "
696,4," These are the transactions whereby Duetsche Solar must pay for and take delivery of certain quantities of polycrystalline silicon 
or otherwise pay Hemlock the value of the agreed upon amount in the event it does not take delivery."
696,5," The European Union's antitrust laws make it illegal for firms above a certain European market capitalization to enter into take-
or-pay contracts. Treaty Establishing the European [**31]  Community, Rome Treaty, March 25, 1957, Articles 81 & 82. "
699,6," In its brief Deutsche Solar employs a disjunctive ""and"". "
700,7," Hemlock briefly makes a subsidiary argument in its response to Deutsche Solar's Motion to Compel that ""if there remains 
something that Deutsche Solar wants, the request is improper, because it has no viable defense premised on the 'trade cases.'"" 
ECF No. 37 at 14. To the extent that [**46]  this argument mirrors Hemlock's argument in its motion to strike it is either meritless 
or premature. In either event, Deutsche Solar's request is, at this stage, relevant to its affirmative defenses. "

727,1," A generic drug is a drug designed to be identical to an already-FDA-approved pioneer drug in active ingredients, safety, and 
efficacy, and thus therapeutically equivalent to its brand-name counterpart. (See PLIVA, Inc. v. Mensing (2011) 564 U.S. 604, 
612, fn. 2 [180 L. Ed. 2d 580, 588, fn. 2, 131 S. Ct. 2567, 2574, fn. 2].) "
728,2," While the litigation was ongoing, Barr agreed to accept contribution to its litigation costs from another generic drug 
manufacturer, defendant The Rugby Group, Inc., a then subsidiary of defendant Hoechst Marion Roussel, Inc., in exchange for a 
share of the benefits of any settlement, judgment, or sale of generic ciprofloxacin hydrochloride. (In re Ciprofloxacin 
Hydrochloride Antitrust Litigation, supra, 544 F.3d at p. 1328.) In 1998, The Rugby Group, Inc., was acquired by defendant 
Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Generic defendants Barr Laboratories, Inc., The Rugby Group, Inc., Watson, and Hoechst Marion 
Roussel, Inc., are referred to collectively as Barr. "
729,3," As discussed [****11]  below, both In re Ciprofloxacin Hydrochloride Antitrust Litigation, supra, 544 F.3d 1323 and a second 
decision rejecting a federal antitrust challenge to the Cipro settlement, Arkansas Carpenters Health & Welfare Fund v. Bayer 
AG, supra, 604 F.3d 98, were decided under principles later rejected by the United States Supreme Court in Actavis, supra, 570 
U.S. ___ [186 L. Ed. 2d 343, 133 S. Ct. 2223]. "
730,4," Amendments to the Hatch-Waxman Act postdating the settlement in this case may have partially alleviated the complete 
bottleneck problem (Hemphill, Paying for Delay: Pharmaceutical Patent Settlement as a Regulatory Design Problem, supra, 81 
N.Y.U. L.Rev. at p. 1587), although not issues arising from the 30-month stay or the reduced incentives for other generics, 
without the carrot of 180 days of duopoly, to bring patent challenges (12 Areeda & Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law (3d ed. 2012) ¶ 
2046, p. 341). "
731,5," As we noted in People v. Building Maintenance etc. Assn., supra, 41 Cal.2d at pages 726–727, a separate section of the 
Cartwright Act effectively codifies this principle: “It is not unlawful to enter into agreements or form associations or combinations, "
732,," the purpose and effect of which is to promote, encourage or increase competition in any trade or industry, or which are in 
furtherance of trade.” (Bus. & Prof. Code, § 16725.)"
732,6," See In re Tamoxifen Citrate Antitrust Litigation (2d Cir. 2006) 466 F.3d 187; cf. In re Cardizem CD Antitrust Litigation, supra, 
332 F.3d at pages 907–909 (adopting per se rule); In re K-Dur Antitrust Litigation (3d Cir. 2012) 686 F.3d 197 (adopting quick 
look rule of reason analysis). "
734,7," As commentators have noted, an excess of invalid patents is one of the principal problems in modern patent law. (See Ford, 
Patent Invalidity Versus Noninfringement (2013) 99 Cornell L.Rev. 71, 74 & fn. 11 [discussing substantial scholarship on the 
point].) The pro-patent-challenge policy is particularly strong in the Hatch-Waxman Act setting, given the 180-day exclusivity 
bounty Congress adopted as an incentive to bring such challenges. (See 21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(5)(B)(iv); 12 Areeda & Hovenkamp, 
Antitrust Law, supra, ¶ 2046, p. 340; Carrier, Unsettling Drug Patent Settlements: A Framework for Presumptive Illegality, 
supra, 108 Mich. L.Rev. at pp. 43, 64; ante, at p. 134.) "
735,8," After the settlement, Bayer submitted the ’444 patent to the Patent and Trademark [****28]  Office for reexamination and 
obtained reaffirmation that it was not invalid. (See 35 U.S.C. § 302.) Later patent challenges by litigants other than Barr were 
unsuccessful. (See In re Ciprofloxacin Hydrochloride Antitrust Litigation (E.D.N.Y. 2005) 363 F. Supp. 2d 514, 519–520.) "
736,9," The Actavis treatment of patents as in some sense probabilistic rests on a substantial body of scholarship suggesting patents 
are best understood this way. (See, e.g., Lemley & Shapiro, Probabilistic Patents, supra, 19 J. Econ. Persp. at pp. 75–76, 95; 
Shapiro, Antitrust Analysis of Patent Settlements Between Rivals (Summer 2003) 17 Antitrust 70, 75; Leffler & Leffler, The 
Probabilistic Nature of Patent Rights: In Response to Kevin McDonald (Summer 2003) 17 Antitrust 77; Shapiro, Antitrust limits to 
patent settlements (2003) 34 RAND J. Econ. 391, 395.) Others, including the Actavis dissenters, have disagreed, insisting a 
patent ultimately is always only valid or invalid, whether we know it yet [****31]  or not. (Actavis, supra, 570 U.S. at p. ___ [186 L. 
Ed. 2d at p. 372, 133 S. Ct. at p. 2244] (dis. opn. of Roberts, C. J.); Schildkraut, Patent-Splitting Settlements and the Reverse 
Payment Fallacy (2004) 71 Antitrust L.J. 1033; McDonald, Hatch-Waxman Patent Settlements and Antitrust: On “Probabilistic” 
Patent Rights and False Positives (Spring 2003) 17 Antitrust 68.) The Supreme Court majority's views are conclusive as to which 
side of this philosophical divide over the proper treatment of patents is correct, and we follow them. "
739,10," To be clear, because the relevant baseline is the result that would have occurred in the absence of any agreement, it is not a 
cognizable harm simply to show that the parties might have elected a different settlement agreement more favorable to 
competition and consumers. There is no statutory right to have parties enter the agreement most favorable to competition, only a 
prohibition against entering agreements that harm competition. "
740,11," To some extent, the settlement agreement challenged here is a relic. Cash reverse payments were not uncommon in the 
1990s, but shortly thereafter brands and generics began using a wide range of other forms of consideration to accomplish 
reverse payment. (See Hemphill, An Aggregate Approach to Antitrust: Using New Data and Rulemaking to Preserve Drug 
Competition, supra, 109 Colum. L.Rev. at pp. 647–658.) Because [****46]  the Cipro settlement involved cash, we need not 
define precisely what noncash forms of consideration will qualify, but courts considering Cartwright Act claims should not let 
creative variations in the form of consideration result in the purchase of freedom from competition escaping detection. "
741,12," We do not suggest a defendant's testimony concerning the value conveyed in side agreements is entitled to any more weight 
than the plaintiff's, only that the defendants have the initial burden of introducing evidence of agreements for the purchase of 
other products or services sufficiently valuable to explain any payment. "
742,13," Here, the brand, Bayer, settled out of the antitrust case, and Barr would not be in a superior position with regard to knowledge 
of Bayer's future patent litigation costs, so the burden of production on this point would remain with plaintiffs."
742,14," While this is a broadly shared economic tenet, it has also been empirically demonstrated by the FDA in the current context. 
(See FDA, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, Generic Competition and Drug Prices (2010) online at 
<http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/Officeofmedicalproductsandtobacco/CDER/ucm129385.htm> [as of May 7, 
2015].) Indeed, in its briefing Barr effectively concedes this is the case here: “[E]ach day of early entry would have cost [****53]  
Bayer more given the price of its branded product than it would have benefitted Barr given the price of its generic product.”"
742,15," Actavis, supra, 570 U.S. at pages ___–___ [186 L. Ed. 2d at pages 361–362, 133 S. Ct. at pages 2234–2235]; see, e.g.,

and the Economy, supra, at page 166; Shapiro, Antitrust limits to patent settlements, supra, 34 RAND J. Econ. at pages 394–
395. "
743,16," See In re Tamoxifen Citrate Antitrust Litigation, supra, 466 F.3d at page 211 (noting the “troubling dynamic” that “[t]he less 
sound the patent or the less clear the infringement, and therefore the less justified the monopoly enjoyed by the patent holder, 
the more a rule permitting settlement is likely to benefit the patent holder by allowing it to retain the patent”); Hemphill, An 
Aggregate Approach to Antitrust: Using New Data and Rulemaking to Preserve Drug Competition, supra, 109 Colum. L.Rev. at 
page 638 (treating patents as conclusively valid until expiration “produces the absurd result that an ironclad patent and a trivial 
patent have the same exclusionary force”); Bulow, The Gaming of Pharmaceutical Patents in Innovation Policy and the 
Economy, volume 4, supra, at page 167."
743,17," The Harris model also addresses the effects of asymmetric information, but different perspectives on the likelihood of success 
are unlikely to alone render it possible for a supralitigation costs reverse payment settlement to be efficient. (Elhauge & Krueger, 
Solving the Patent Settlement Puzzle, supra, 91 Tex. L.Rev. at pp. 300–303, 325–329.) Money may be needed to bridge the gap 
between the parties' expectations, but a rational brand asked to pay more than its litigation costs to persuade a generic with 
different perceptions would, in the ordinary case, presumably just litigate. "
744,18," See FTC v. Indiana Federation of Dentists, supra, 476 U.S. at pages 459–461; National Soc. of Professional Engineers v. U. 
S., supra, 435 U.S. at page 693; 7 Areeda & Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law (3d ed. 2010) ¶¶ 1504b, 1507c, pages 402–403, 430."
744,19," This point also addresses Barr's argument that causation is lacking in reverse payment cases because absent a settlement, 
the parties would have litigated, the patentee would likely or surely have won, and consumers would have been no better off. At 
the time of settlement, the outcome of future litigation is uncertain, and an agreement that “seeks to prevent the risk of "
745,," competition” causes, i.e., has as a “consequence … the relevant anticompetitive harm.” (Actavis, supra, 570 U.S. at p. ___ [186 
L. Ed. 2d at p. 363, 133 S. Ct. at p. 2236].)"
745,20," Some kinds of evidence may also be suspect: Once a brand and a generic challenger settle, their incentives align in favor of 
arguing that the patent was stronger and more clearly infringed than it may have appeared at the time. "
747,21," A second federalism concern raised by the Court of Appeal, that state antitrust scrutiny would intrude on the exclusivity of 
federal court patent jurisdiction (see 28 U.S.C. § 1338(a)), likewise presents no issue. This exclusive jurisdiction does not 
prevent state courts from deciding state law claims incidentally touching on the validity [****69]  of a patent. (Caldera 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Regents of University of California (2012) 205 Cal.App.4th 338, 353–356 [140 Cal. Rptr. 3d 543].) 
Moreover, the “slim category” of state law claims subject to exclusive federal patent jurisdiction includes only those that 
“‘necessarily raise’” a federal patent issue. (Gunn v. Minton (2013) 568 U.S. ___, ___ [185 L.Ed.2d 72, 79, 133 S.Ct. 1059, 
1065].) As we have discussed, it is entirely possible to resolve an antitrust challenge to a reverse payment patent settlement 
without adjudicating the patent's validity. "
751,1," Under Federal law, the ECP is required to give the patient her prescription so the patient can purchase the contact lenses from 
the retailer of her choice based on price and convenience, among other factors. 15 U.S.C. § 7601(a); 16 C.F.R. § 315.3. "
752,2," See H.R. Rep. No. 108-318, at 4; Pub. L. 108-164, Fairness to Contact Lens Consumer Act (2003), codified at 15 U.S.C. § 
7601 et seq."
752,3," The State of Utah and the Intervenors refer to the Plaintiffs' UPPs as minimum resale price maintenance (""RPM"") policies."
752,4," There are motions pending to coordinate or consolidate the actions into a multidistrict litigation forum. In re Disposable Contact 
Lens Antitrust Litigation, MDL No. 2626 (2015). "
760,1," The City seeks judicial notice of several Los Angeles ordinances and the corresponding administrative code sections that 
codify those ordinances. (Dkt. No. 57, City's RJN, Exhibits 1-6.) Under Federal Rule of Evidence 201, a court may take judicial 
notice of laws, regulations, and rules because they are matters of public records and therefore ""not subject to reasonable dispute 
in that [they are] capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be 
questioned."" See Santa Monica Food Not Bombs v. City of Santa Monica, 450 F.3d 1022, 1025 n.2 (9th Cir. 2006) (quoting Fed. 
R. Evid. 201). The Court grants the City's unopposed request with respect to RJN Exhibits 1-7. "
761,2," In 2012, an LAX contractor sued the City, alleging, among other things, that the Airport LWO was preempted by the federal 
Railway Labor Act, among other claims. The district court rejected the plaintiff's preemption theory and granted summary 
judgment in favor [**5]  of the City. See Calop Bus. Sys., Inc. v. City of Los Angeles, 984 F. Supp. 2d 981, 990 (C.D. Cal. 2013) 
(Ninth Circuit appeal pending)."
761,3," These ordinances define terms like ""Hotel,"" ""Hotel Employer,"" ""Hotel Worker,"" and ""Service Charges,"" and the ordinances 
include exemptions for collective bargaining agreements. The definitions and collective bargaining exemptions are identical to 
those included in the Wage Ordinance at issue in this case and are reproduced below."
761,4," In 2008, an airport hotel subject to the AHZE Ordinance filed a lawsuit, arguing among other things that the ordinance was 
preempted under the National Labor Relations Act. The district court granted the City's motion to dismiss, holding that the 
ordinance was not preempted because it ""simply set[] the rate of the 'living wage' and then allow[ed] the hotels to enter into a 
collective bargaining agreement if they wish[ed to do so]. The [ordinance imposed] no restrictions on the terms of the collective 
bargaining agreement [but rather] allowed a collective bargaining agreement to set wages at a rate higher or lower than the 
wage set by the Ordinance."" Fortuna Enterprises, L.P. v. City of Los Angeles, 673 F. Supp. 2d 1000, 1005-06 (C.D. Cal. 2008). 
The Fortuna plaintiff initially appealed the district court's order, but the appeal was voluntarily dismissed pursuant to a stipulation 
by the parties. See id., No. CV 08-4373 [**7]  SVW (MANx) at docket entry 32. "
766,5," Plaintiffs assert that this provision — the ban on unilateral implementation — in and of itself renders the Wage Ordinance 
preempted under the Machinists doctrine. "
770,6," See City's RJN, Exhibits 5-6."
770,7," In this regard, the distinction between cases involving substantive minimum labor standards, on the one hand, and cases 
involving statutes or regulations affecting labor relations, on the other hand, is both relevant and critical. Compare, e.g., Brown, 
554 U.S. 60, 128 S. Ct. 2408, 171 L. Ed. 2d 264 (2008) (holding preempted two provisions of a California statute where the 
provisions precluded the use of state funds ""to assist, promote, or deter union organizing""), and Golden State Transit Corp., 475 
U.S. at 611-12 (holding preempted the City of Los Angeles's decision to condition [**38]  the renewal of a taxi cab franchise on 
the taxi cab company resolving a pending labor dispute with its union), with Metropolitan Life, 471 U.S. 724, 105 S. Ct. 2380, 85 
L. Ed. 2d 728 (holding not preempted a substantive minimum labor standard), and Fort Halifax, 482 U.S. 1, 107 S. Ct. 2211, 96 
L. Ed. 2d 1 (same). "

773,14," The Court has quoted the declaration of Robert Hannigan, Director of Operations for Hotel Palomar Westwood, only as an 
example. The other declarations by representatives for non-union Hotels provide similar accounts."
773,15," The Court recognizes that Plaintiffs cite Golden State for the opposite point, i.e., that legislative motive is in fact relevant to the 
preemption analysis. (See Reply to City's Opp. at 19.) Plaintiffs' reliance on Golden State for this proposition is misplaced. At 
issue in Golden State was not the legislature's motive in passing an otherwise facially neutral ordinance (as is the case here) but 
rather the undisputed fact that the City explicitly conditioned the renewal of a taxi cab franchise agreement on the employer 
settling a labor dispute with its union. The Supreme Court held that the City's threat to withhold the franchise renewal absent a 
resolution of the labor dispute encroached on the employer's ""essential weapon of economic strength — the ability to wait out 
the strike."" Golden State Transit Corp., 475 U.S. at 611-12; see also id. at 615 (explaining that both parties were permissibly 
using economic weapons as a legitimate part of their collective-bargaining process — e.g., the union striking at a time the City "
774,," was considering the franchise [**50]  renewal, and the employer waiting out the strike in an attempt to obtain bargaining 
concessions — but that the bargaining process was ""thwarted when the city in effect imposed a positive durational limit to the 
exercise of economic self-help""). "
777,16," See New York Tel. Co. v. New York State Dep't of Labor, 440 U.S. 519, 540-546, 99 S. Ct. 1328, 59 L. Ed. 2d 553 (1979) 
(holding that the NLRA does not preempt a state law providing unemployment benefits to striking workers). [**62]"
777,17," The Ninth Circuit acknowledged this distinction in the context of affirming the principles of Metropolitan Life. See Barnes, 942 
F.2d at 693 (""The policies underlying the NLRA, restoration of equality of bargaining power and encouragement of collective 
bargaining, are not affected by the kind of the minimum standards contained in the Massachusetts law [at issue in Metropolitan 
Life]."")."
777,18," Notably, Barnes involved what would appropriately be referred to as an ""as applied"" challenge to the Montana WDA."
777,19," The Ninth Circuit has since held that it is entirely permissible (and not preempted under the NLRA) for an employer to be liable 
for the difference between a higher statutory minimum wage rate and a lower negotiated rate during the interim period between "
778,," effective collective bargaining agreements when the subsequent [**64]  agreement is not retroactive to cover the gap period. 
See NBC, 70 F.3d at 71-72 (holding that a state cannot ""withhold its minimum benefit protections from employees solely on the 
ground that they were bound by a collective bargaining agreement,"" and union employees are allowed ""the full protection of the 
minimum standard, absent any agreement for something different"")."
778,20," Pro Football provides a detailed and comprehensive analysis of the many nuanced issues at the intersection of federal 
antitrust and labor laws, particularly with respect to multi-employer collective bargaining. For the most part, the analysis is not 
relevant to the issues in this case, and therefore the Court does not discuss it here."
778,21," The Court surmises that when Pro Football was decided in 1996, $1,000 per week (roughly $25 per hour for a 40-hour work 
week) was well [**67]  above each of the applicable then-state minimum wages. "
779,22," While, currently, Local 11 is the only union representing hotel workers in the Los Angeles area, there is nothing preventing 
another union — one that does not organize exclusively vis-à-vis card-check/neutrality agreement — from organizing hotel 
workers at any given hotel in the City in the future. "
788,1," The named Plaintiffs in this action are Alfred T. Giuliano, Chapter 7 Trustee to the Ritz Estate (""Ritz""), CPM Electronics Inc. 
(""CPM""), E.S.E. Electronics, Inc. (""ESE""), and MFLASH, Inc. (""MFLASH"") (collectively, ""Plaintiffs"")."
788,2," Flash memory is non-volatile, meaning that data is not lost when there is no power. "
789,3," While Plaintiffs allege that SanDisk has maintained a monopoly in the relevant market for NAND flash chips, or has attempted 
to monopolize this market, they only move to certify a class of direct purchasers of final flash products."
789,4," The Disputed Patents are U.S. Patent No. 5,172,338 (""the '338 patent""), and U.S. Patent No. 5,991,517 (""the '517 patent""). The 
'338 patent was issued in 1992, while the '517 patent was issued in 1999. Both patents expired in 2009. Plaintiffs contend that 
SanDisk procured the Disputed Patents by intentionally making material misrepresentations to, and withholding prior art from, 
the Patent and Trademark Office (""PTO"")."
789,5," According to Plaintiffs, ""[b]ecause SanDisk and its licensees made up more than 88% of the market, SanDisk was able to raise 
its own prices. . . . Essentially, if all its licensees charged a higher price, SanDisk could too. But, because it did not have to pay a 
royalty itself, SanDisk could keep these supra-competitive profits."" "
790,6," The operative complaint defines the Final Flash Products Class, in part, as all ""persons residing in the United States who, on or 
after June 25, 2006, directly purchased from SanDisk, or from its controlled and licensed joint venture with Toshiba Corporation, 
final flash products using technology claimed to be patented by SanDisk ('Final Flash Product Class')."" (Emphasis added). 
Below, the Court will discuss whether it is proper for Plaintiffs to seek to certify a class that is broader than the class defined in 
the operative complaint."
790,7," The proposed class definition further states: ""Such products include, without limitation, those that SanDisk sold to retail firms, 
OEMs, and distributors. Purchases of final flash products that contain a microcontroller - a semiconductor that interfaces with 
electronic equipment and operates the flash memory - are included in the class. Purchases of flash memory combined with 
dynamic random access memory ('DRAM'), flash memory combined with static random access memory ('SRAM'), or flash 
memory combined with a microprocessor ('system on a chip') are excluded from the class."" "
792,8," According to Dr. Sullivan, he corroborated this direct evidence with economic evaluation of market definition, substitutability 
across products, and market concentration. See Sullivan Decl. ¶ 13. "
793,9," Dr. Sullivan claims that such an analysis allows for a determination of the magnitude of royalties that would have occurred ""but

793,11," In other words, Dr. Sullivan claims that his econometric model provides explanatory factors that explain the vast majority of 
differences in final flash product prices across different products, purchasers, and time periods. Sullivan Rep. ¶ 114."
793,12," SanDisk does not challenge Dr. Sullivan's qualifications as an expert. Having reviewed Dr. Sullivan's curriculum vitae, the 
Court finds that he is qualified to render expert opinions in the field of antitrust economics. It is undisputed that Dr. Sullivan 
earned his B.A., M.A., and Ph.D. in economics from the University of California, San Diego, and that Dr. Sullivan has published 
economic research in peer-reviewed academic journals as well as articles on calculating lost profits and reasonable royalty 
damages. Sullivan Decl. ¶ 7; see also Sullivan Rep. ¶ 7, Exh. A-1. It is also undisputed that Dr. Sullivan has provided 
professional economic consulting services since 1992, including economic analyses on issues such as monopolization, 
restraints of trade, lost profits, and reasonable royalty. Sullivan Decl. ¶¶ 1-3, 8; see also Sullivan Rep. ¶ 8, Exh. A-1. "
794,13, Dr. Sullivan's report also identifies the submarkets set forth in the operative complaint. Sullivan Rep. ¶ 47.
794,14," Enforcement of a patent obtained by fraud constitutes an unlawful exclusionary act. See Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert 
Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law ¶ 705e (3d ed. 2008). Such enforcement is not limited to infringement actions, it can also include 
refusing to license or ""licensing and thus increasing rivals' costs."" Id."
794,15," To determine the impact of SanDisk's competitors' costs on SanDisk's prices for final flash products, Dr. Sullivan utilized linear 
regression analysis to measure the statistical relationship between SanDisk's prices and the costs of its competitors, controlling 
for other factors. See Sullivan Rep. ¶¶ 96-97. Dr. Sullivan used the statistical relationships to determine the extent to which 
higher competitor costs from royalties earned by the Disputed Patents resulted in higher prices paid by consumers for final flash 
products sold by SanDisk. Id. ¶ 96. Dr. Sullivan asserts that ""[s]uch a reduced form [econometric] approach to measuring the 
effects of costs on prices is supported by published economic literature,"" and that ""[t]he regressions for determining the effect of 
competitor costs on SanDisk are based upon economic theory, statistical evaluation, and economic literature."" Id. ¶¶ 96-97. Dr. 
Sullivan further asserts that a reduced form approach, which is an econometric technique that measures the overall impact of 
one variable on another without requiring separate structural modeling of intermediate variables or steps, is well-accepted and 
well supported in published economics literature for estimating the impact of costs on prices, and is economically appropriate 
here because separate structural estimation of restricted output and supra-competitive prices, individually, is not needed to 
determine the overall impact of royalties on SanDisk prices. Sullivan Decl. ¶ 20. "
795,16," It is undisputed that the HHI is a widely accepted method used by economists to measure market concentration. ProMedica 
Health System, Inc. v. F.T.C., 749 F.3d 559, 568 (6th Cir. 2014). The HHI is calculated by summing the squares of the individual 
firms' market shares. Id. HHI data is used to classify markets into three types: unconcentrated markets, moderately concentrated 
markets, and highly concentrated markets. Id. "
796,17," To the extent SanDisk objects to portions of Dr. Sullivan's deposition testimony, the Court will not address those objections. 
Plaintiffs do not rely on Dr. Sullivan's deposition testimony to satisfy any of Rule 23's requirements. "
797,18," The Semico data includes worldwide revenue, units, and average selling prices for NAND chips on a monthly basis. Sullivan 
Rep. ¶ 79. The Semico data also includes worldwide revenues, units, and average selling prices for USB drives, memory cards, 
solid state hard drives, MP3 players, and portable media players on a quarterly basis. Id. "
798,19," In its reply brief, SanDisk reiterates its argument that Dr. Sullivan's econometric model is incapable of determining any effect of 
the Semico data. SanDisk contends that the fatal flaw in Dr. Sullivan's ""methodology"" is ""caused by a well-recognized error 
known as 'perfect collinearity.'"" Contrary to SanDisk's contention, this ""error"" is not a sufficient basis to exclude Dr. Sullivan's 
regression analysis. Regressions have been admitted in the face of expert disagreement regarding whether collinearity posed a 
problem. See In re High Fructose Corn Syrup Antitrust Lit., 295 F.3d 651, 660-661 (7th Cir. 2002); see also In re High-Tech 
Employee, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 47181, 2014 WL 1351040, at *21 n. 51 (noting that the admission of such regressions ""is not 
surprising given that the concept of collinearity is not a methodology, but a common phenomenon that results when using the 
methodology of regression analysis"") (emphasis in original) (citing Daubert, 509 U.S. at 595 (""The focus [of the admissibility 
inquiry], of course, must be solely on principles and methodology, not on the conclusions that they generate.""))."
798,20," Dr. Sullivan calculated his competitor NAND flash chip costs variable by multiplying the number of gigabytes per SanDisk 
product by the price per gigabyte derived from the market-wide data on NAND flash [chip] sales provided by Semico. Sullivan 
Rep. ¶ 97(d). Dr. Sullivan then calculated royalties per gigabyte in the worldwide NAND marketplace over time and connected 
them to the SanDisk sales data based on the time period and capacity of each SanDisk product. Id. ¶ 99. According to Dr. 
Sullivan, royalties calculated in this way for each SanDisk sale represent the actual royalties paid by competitors and the 
royalties that would have been paid by competitors but for SanDisk's alleged fraudulent obtainment of the patents-at-issue. Id. 
Dr. Sullivan opines that the coefficients from the regression model can be combined with the percentage decrease in competitor 
NAND flash chip costs resulting from lower royalties to calculate the overpayment associated with each sale in the SanDisk 
data. Id. Dr. Sullivan concludes that damages to any individual customer can be determined based on the sum total of this 
overpayment across all NAND flash products purchased from SanDisk. Id. "
802,21," Without citation to authority or legal analysis, SanDisk asserts that Ritz and CPM are not adequate representatives of class 
members whose claims are barred by a prior settlement. The Court rejects SanDisk's unsupported argument. It is not the role of 
the Court to make the parties' arguments for them. See Indep. Towers of Wash. v. Wash., 350 F.3d 925, 929 (9th Cir. 2003). 
That aside, SanDisk's argument fails on the merits. Even if some of the absent class members' claims are barred by a prior 
settlement, SanDisk has failed to show how such circumstances demonstrate that Ritz's or CPM's interests are antagonistic to 
any member of the proposed class or that either entity will be unable to prosecute this action vigorously on behalf of the 
proposed class. "
804,22," SanDisk asserts that Plaintiffs' failure to demonstrate that they can establish the market power element of their antitrust claims 
on a class-wide basis with common proof is discussed in detail in their motion to exclude, which ""SanDisk hereby incorporates 
by reference."" The Court rejects SanDisk's attempt to incorporate arguments by reference that it made in its motion to exclude. 
Allowing litigants to engage in such conduct would provide an effective means of deliberately circumventing page limits on briefs 
set forth in the Civil Local Rules and this Court's Civil Standing Orders. This Court only considers arguments that are specifically 
and distinctively raised by the parties in their briefs. In any event, the Court has already considered and rejected the arguments 
SanDisk seeks to incorporate by reference. "
805,23," For example, SanDisk argues that Dr. Sullivan's opinion as to the impact of the Disputed Patents is not grounded in economic 
reality because, among other things, his methodology for interpolating the Disputed Patents' royalty share between 1998 and 
2008 is fundamentally flawed, and because he assumes, without empirical support, that the value of the Disputed Patents was 
common across licensees. In addition, SanDisk argues that Dr. Sullivan's pass-through opinion is ""riddled"" with flawed 
assumptions, and that Dr. Sullivan failed to perform empirical analysis that would support his assumption that SanDisk 
responded to supposed final flash product increases by its competitors by raising prices of its own products. SanDisk also 
argues that Dr. Sullivan's regression model provides no evidence that competitors' costs affect SanDisk's final flash product 
prices, and that Dr. Sullivan's model improperly assumes common impact and cannot be used to establish a relationship to 
estimate the impact of royalties attributable to the Disputed Patents on SanDisk's prices because royalty data is not used in the 
regression. "
811,1," Plaintiffs dispute whether Ocean Spray is a true agricultural cooperative. Docket # 137 ¶ 1. I will refer to it as such because it 
holds itself out that way and because many other courts have called it a cooperative. See, e.g., Northland Cranberries, Inc. v. 
Ocean Spray Cranberries, Inc., 382 F. Supp. 2d 221, 223 (D. Mass. 2004); see also Ocean Spray Cranberries, Inc. v. 
PepsiCo, Inc., 160 F.3d 58, 59 (1st Cir. 1998). But, because I do not need to make a finding about Ocean Spray's precise 
business form to decide these motions, I do not do so."
811,2," The parties dispute whether Ocean Spray purchases or takes title to the fruit. The court does not find this distinction to be 
relevant to resolving the pending motions."
811,3," Ocean Spray alleges that the B Pool consists of former independent growers, including former Ocean Spray growers. 
Cranberry growers joining Ocean Spray must join as B Pool growers. According to the operative complaint, Ocean Spray's 
Board of Directors is comprised of only A Pool growers."
811,4," The parties dispute whether there is any mixing of A and B Pool fruit. That dispute is not material to the resolution of these 
motions. "
813,5," Defendants style their challenge as one to the antitrust injury element, but the case law they cite is about the remoteness 
element. This confusion comes, in part, from cases that blend the antitrust injury and antitrust standing inquiries. Compare SAS 
of Puerto Rico, Inc. v. Puerto Rico Tel. Co., 48 F.3d 39, 43 (1st Cir. 1995) (suggesting that antitrust injury and standing inquiries 
are the same), with Cargill, Inc. v. Monfort of Colo., Inc., 479 U.S. 104, 110 n.5, 107 S. Ct. 484, 93 L. Ed. 2d 427 (1986) (""A 
showing of antitrust injury is necessary, but not always sufficient, to establish standing under § 4.""). Here, I use ""antitrust injury"" 
in the narrow sense, i.e., whether an injury is ""of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flows from that 
which makes defendants' acts unlawful,"" Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 U.S. 477, 489, 97 S. Ct. 690, 50 L. 
Ed. 2d 701 (1977), and I use ""antitrust standing"" to refer to the remoteness inquiry. "
815,6," Defendants' argument that one B Pool plaintiff, Stacy Preston Winters, lacks standing because the scheme was designed for 
her benefit is unpersuasive. The harm that Winters complains of in the monopsony claim is consolidation of the grower—handler 
market, leading to reduced competition among handlers. This would lead to more allocative inefficiency for all growers not in the 
A Pool, whether B Pool members or independent. That Winters may have benefited from the other alleged antitrust violation, 
predatory pricing in the handler—consumer market, does not undermine Winters' monopsony claim."
815,7," Defendants contend that they are entitled to summary judgment because plaintiffs are neither consumers nor competitors of 
Ocean Spray in the relevant markets. They cite a string of First Circuit authority limiting antitrust standing to such groups in 
traditional monopolization cases. See, e.g., Serpa, 199 F.3d at 10; SAS, 48 F.3d at 44. But defendants' rote recitation of that 
case law ignores the nature of plaintiffs' claim—it is one for monopsonization, not monopolization. In this context, the proper 
focus is on sellers, not customers. See Mandeville Island Farms, Inc. v. Am. Crystal Sugar Co., 334 U.S. 219, 235, 68 S. Ct. 
996, 92 L. Ed. 1328 (1948) (""It is clear that the agreement is the sort of combination condemned by the [Sherman] Act, even 
though the price-fixing was by purchasers, and the persons specially injured under the treble damages claim are sellers, not 
customers or competitors."") (footnotes omitted); cf. Weyerhaeuser, 549 U.S. at 321 (noting ""close theoretical connection 
between monopoly and monopsony"" and adopting ""mirror image"" analytical approach)."
815,8," There are, of course, allegations that independent handlers were harmed by Ocean Spray's alleged predatory pricing behavior 
in the handler—consumer market, but that is not relevant to this inquiry. "
816,9," To the extent plaintiffs contend that they are competitors with Ocean Spray because the Ocean Spray cooperative is the same 
thing as the Ocean Spray growers, the court disagrees. Agricultural cooperatives are generally distinct corporate entities from 
the growers that have a stake in them. See, e.g., Kuntz v. Lamar Corp., 385 F.3d 1177, 1183 (9th Cir. 2004). Here, that is 
particularly true because defendants are distinct corporate entities, i.e., a Delaware corporation and a Delaware limited liability 
company. Plaintiffs have not offered sufficient evidence to allow a reasonable jury to conclude that the cooperative is an alter 
ego of its members or that any other corporate veil-piercing doctrines apply here."
816,10," Having concluded that no plaintiffs have antitrust standing to bring their monopolization claim, I do not separately consider 
whether the one B Pool plaintiff, Stacy Preston Winters, is barred from bringing this claim as an intended beneficiary of the 
anticompetitive conduct. "
817,11," This count is brought only on behalf of independent growers, not members of the B Pool."
817,12," Plaintiffs do not brief this point in their opposition, but they do advance this theory in their own motion for summary judgment, 
and defendants addressed it in their motion. "
819,13," The court is concerned that the class certification motion, as last filed, is not in final form. For example, it includes a significant 
amount of yellow highlighting, and is written, in part, in the first person. See Docket # 129 at 13-15. Given the inherently complex 
nature of this antitrust case, the court expects the parties to make efforts to ensure that their arguments are complete and 
efficiently presented. "
820,14," Likewise, all counsel who intend to appear in this case are instructed to check the docket and ensure that they have entered a 
notice of appearance or motion for pro hac vice admission. "
825,1," Plaintiff defines ""college"" for the purpose of this action as ""a regionally accredited, not-for-profit educational institution in the 
United States that offers four-year (baccalaureate), full-time programs."" Am. Compl. ¶ 17. "
826,2," On November 3, 2014, the Court dismissed Plaintiff's 103-page Complaint under Rule 8. Plaintiff submitted the present 55-

826,3," There is a $2 difference per application between Exclusive and Non-Exclusive members. Am. Compl. ¶ 78. Plaintiff 
characterizes this as a ""penalty"" on Non-Exclusive members. Id. Defendant characterizes it as a ""modest, two-tiered incentive 
discount"" for Exclusive members. Def.'s Mot. 24. "
827,4," ""Institutional Supplements"" are member-specific [**7]  supplements which many members require in addition to the Common 
Application. Am. Compl. ¶ 15."
827,5," While Plaintiff's Amended Complaint says that members are required to ""not explicitly offer special benefits,"" Am. Compl. ¶ 46

Form for Non-Exclusive members states that members are required ""to explicitly offer special benefits."" Def.'s Request for 
Judicial Notice, Ex. 2 at 4, [82]. "
831,6," Because the lack of antitrust injury disposes of the entire case, the Court declines to reach the parties' additional arguments 
regarding the merits of specific claims. "
843,1," The Court accepts as true the facts alleged in Relator's and Plaintiff's amended complaint and makes all reasonable inferences 
in their favor. See McReynolds v. Merrill Lynch & Co., 694 F.3d 873, 879 (7th Cir. 2012)."
843,2," The FCA was amended in 2009, and various sections of the FCA became effective at different times. See, e.g., United States 
ex rel. Frawley v. McMahon, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 423, 2015 WL 115763, at *8 (N.D. Ill. Jan. 5, 2015). Here, the allegedly 
fraudulent conduct relating to the 2008 and 2010 CCHHS contracts took place both before and after the FCA amendments went 
into effect, meaning that most likely both the pre- and post-amendment statutes are relevant here."
843,3," Sami Distributors argues in its reply brief that Relator's claims against it are barred by res judicata based on Relator's voluntary 
dismissal of individual Defendants Faisal Sami and Sarah Faisal. [See 121, at 1-4.] But res judicata has no application here. The 
preclusive effect of the voluntary dismissal with prejudice means that Relator is barred from raising similar claims against Faisal 
Sami and Sarah Faisal in a separate lawsuit; it does not release Sami Distributors from the claims currently pending against it. "
847,4," Exactly how, or if, Defendants' fraudulent [**19]  inducement resulted in a financial loss to the government is unclear from 
Relator's complaint. But ""whether harm to the public fisc is an essential element of a qui tam action"" is unclear, as the Supreme 
Court failed to address that issue after granting certiorari on that very question. See Hughes Aircraft Co. v. United States ex rel. 
Schumer, 520 U.S. 939, 945, 117 S. Ct. 1871, 138 L. Ed. 2d 135 (1997). Regardless, Defendants did not raise this issue, and so 
the Court need not resolve it here. "
848,5," Defendants pose somewhat of a straw man argument when they argue in response that ""a mere breach of contract does not 
give rise to liability under the False Claims Act."" United States ex rel. Yannacopoulos v. Gen. Dynamics, 652 F.3d 818, 824 (7th 
Cir. 2011) (""If the breaching party falsely claims to be in compliance with the contract to obtain payment, however, there may be 
an actionable false claim.""). This principle exists outside of the fraud-in-the-inducement cases, and instead applies where a party 
misrepresents to the government that it is in compliance with a statute, regulation, or contract in order to induce a government 
benefit. These so-called ""false certification"" cases turn on the extent of the breach and whether the certification of compliance 
was a prerequisite to government payment, such that ""minor technical regulatory violations do not make a claim 'false' for 
purposes of the FCA."" United States ex rel. Gross v. AIDS Research Alliance-Chicago, 415 F.3d 601, 604 (7th Cir. 2005). But a 
mere breach of contract (or noncompliance with a regulation or statute) is different in kind from a fraudulently [**21]  induced 
contract, where at the outset a contracting party has no intention of complying with its contractual obligations. Additionally, 
Relator confirmed that he ""is not pursuing a theory [of liability] based on false certifications, whether such certifications are 
express or implied."" [110, at 10 n.5.]"
848,6," Cook County's M/WBE ordinance allows an M/WBE to function as a broker, which is essentially the role that Relator claims 
Sami filled. But using an M/WBE as a broker only entitles the user to a credit equal to 10 percent of the value of the goods that 
the M/WBE brokers, not the 100 percent that Sami allegedly represented. See Cook County Code § 34-281."
848,7," See Harrison, 176 F.3d at 787-88 (noting that, based on the language in the Supreme Court case of Marcus v. Hess, ""courts 
have found False Claims Act violations in [various] bid-rigging situations""); United States v. CFW Const. Co., Inc., 649 F. Supp. 
616, 618 (D.S.C. 1986) (""The conspiracy to rig bids on two federal funded * * * treatment projects falls within the proscription of 
[31 U.S.C. § 3729(b)(1)(C)]. In addition, the claims for payment submitted to the United States under the rigged contract that 
resulted from the conspiracy are false claims subjecting them to liability under [31 U.S.C. § 3729(b)(1)(A)]."" (internal citations 
omitted)). "
849,8," Even though materiality and reliance/inducement are separate inquiries, because the latter is essentially a more demanding 
version of the former, and because Defendants' arguments related to both issues are based on the same set of facts, the Court 
will address these arguments simultaneously. See, e.g., United States ex rel. Thomas v. Siemens AG, 991 F. Supp. 2d 540, 
569-71 (E.D. Pa. 2014) (discussing the difference between the materiality and reliance/inducement standards). "
850,9, Defendants do not object to Relator's allegations that Sami submitted claims to the Illinois government.
850,10," A private [**28]  entity that ""serve[s] a public function"" in the administration of the Medicare program is ""an 'officer or 
employee' of the United States."" Bodimetric Health Servs., Inc. v. Aetna Life & Cas., 903 F.2d 480, 487-88 (7th Cir. 1990). As 
applied here, CCHHS is thus an officer, employee, or agent of the United States for FCA purposes."
850,11," As mentioned above, the allegedly fraudulent activity here is likely governed by both the current FCA statute (amended in 
2009), and the pre-amendment statute. In briefing their respective motions to dismiss, the parties failed to commit to a particular 
version of the statute, citing cases that apply both versions and implying that there are no relevant differences here (at least at 
this stage). One distinction worth noting, however, is Congress's amending of the definition of ""claim,"" which was meant to 
""clarify and correct erroneous interpretations of the law that were decided in Allison Engine Co. v. United States ex rel. Sanders, 
553 U.S. 662, 128 S.Ct. 2123, 170 L. Ed. 2d 1030 (2008), and United States ex rel. Totten v. Bombardier Corp., 380 F.3d 488, 
363 U.S. App. D.C. 180 (D.C. Cir. 2004)."" S. Rep. No. 111-10, at 10-11 (2009), reprinted in 2009 U.S.C.C.A.N. 430, 438. The 
goal of the amendment was to bring within the proscription of the FCA those who submit false claims to non-governmental 
entities that are funded by or reimbursed by the federal government. See, e.g., id. at 11 (clarifying that the amended FCA "
851,," reaches ""all false claims submitted to State administered Medicaid programs""). Importantly, though, even pre-
amendment, [**30]  courts regularly interpreted the FCA to apply to false claims made to Medicare and Medicaid providers. See, 
e.g., United States ex rel. Tyson v. Amerigroup Ill., Inc., 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24032, 2005 WL 2667207, at *2 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 17, 
2005) (""Indeed, several courts have highlighted the substantial role played by the federal government in its funding and 
enforcement of Medicare and Medicaid programs, and have found frauds upon such programs to fall squarely within the 
protections of the FCA."")."
851,12," Defendants' presentment argument can be construed as either a Rule 8 or a Rule 9(b) issue. The Court addresses both 
arguments here, and thus will not revisit this issue in the Rule 9(b) section."
851,13," Defendants argue that Relator should be required to plead the who, what, where, when, and why regarding the fraud leading 
up to the 2010 contract, as Relator did in connection with the 2008 contract. But this misconstrues Relator's allegations. Relator 
claims that Defendants' fraudulent scheme arose prior to the 2008 contract, and Defendants merely duplicated (or continued) 
that scheme in obtaining the 2010 contract. Relator distinguishes these contracts with the 2011 contract, where CCHHS 
implemented a new bidding system, thus requiring Defendants to devise and implement a new fraudulent scheme to win that 
contract (and thus requiring Relator to set forth with particularity the details of that new scheme). "
852,14," There is a question as to whether Relator's claims related to the 2008 and 2010 CCHHS contracts apply to Defendant Triad 
Isotopes. In his Amended Complaint, Relator alleges in Counts I and II that all Defendants violated the FCA and the IWRPA with 
regards to the 2008 and 2010 CCHHS contracts. However, [**35]  Relator also alleges that CCHHS awarded the later of the two 
contracts (i.e., the 2010 contract) to Sami on February 19, 2010, which was four months before Defendant Triad Isotopes 
completed its acquisition of Covidien's radiopharmacy business. [Am. Compl., 88, ¶¶ 17, 48.] Relator does not allege that Triad 
Isotopes participated in any of the allegedly fraudulent bidding practices related to these contracts, or that Triad Isotopes 
assumed any preexisting liabilities of Covidien. In responding to Triad Isotopes' motion to dismiss, Relator agreed to dismiss 
Triad Isotopes from Counts I and II, but requested that the dismissal be without prejudice in the event that discovery reveals a 
basis for liability. The Court agrees and dismisses Defendant Triad Isotopes from Counts I and II without prejudice. "
854,15, Triad Isotopes and Mr. Giba do not object to Relator's conspiracy allegations.
854,16," Defendants allege that the vertical bid-rigging allegation here should be analyzed under the Rule of Reason, which Plaintiff 
Hot Shots does not dispute. The Court agrees with Defendants. See Leegin Creative Leather Prods., Inc. v. PSKS, Inc., 551 
U.S. 877, 881, 127 S. Ct. 2705, 168 L. Ed. 2d 623 (2007) (""HN22[
] [V]ertical price restraints are to be judged by the rule of 
reason.""). "
855,17," A relevant market is comprised of those ""commodities reasonably interchangeable by consumers for the same purposes."" 
United States v. E.I. Du Pont de Nemours & Co., 351 U.S. 377, 395, 76 S. Ct. 994, 100 L. Ed. 1264 (1956). ""In making this 
determination, the trier must decide whether the product is unique or has close substitutes, as to which there are substantial 
cross-elasticities of demand."" Fishman v. Estate of Wirtz, 807 F.2d 520, 531 (7th Cir. 1986). "
856,18," Hot Shots does not explicitly plead that Triad Isotopes has market power in the Chicago-area radiopharmaceutical market, but 
Hot Shots does allege that Triad Isotopes obtained the 2011 CCHHS contract despite not having the lowest ""actual"" bid, 
implying that Triad Isotopes can ""raise prices above a [**50]  competitive level without losing its business."" See 42nd Parallel 
North, 286 F.3d at 404. Because Hot Shots failed to establish that Defendants' conduct impacted a relevant market, the Court 
need not decide whether Plaintiff met its burden to show that Triad Isotopes had market power in the relevant market. "
857,19," Also unpersuasive is Defendant Trepashko's argument that Hot Shots failed to plead the causation component of antitrust 
injury. See Greater Rockford Energy, 998 F.2d at 395 (noting that ""[a]ntitrust injury involves a causation requirement""). 
Defendant's argument hinges on a literal [**54]  interpretation of Hot Shots' allegation that it ""had the lowest overall bid among 
the legitimate bidders,"" [Am. Compl., 88, at ¶ 69 (emphasis added)], and Defendant claims ignorance as to what Hot Shots 
means to imply with this ""arbitrary, qualifying language."" [95, at 10.] But read in context of the complaint as a whole, the clear 
inference is that Triad Isotopes is the ""illegitimate"" bidder, meaning that but-for Defendants' rigging of the RFP, Hot Shots would 
have been the lowest bidder, and thus would have won the 2011 contract. Defendant Triad Isotopes also argues that ""Hot Shots 
does not allege any facts to show that its lost profits resulted from the alleged reduction in competition."" [100, at 23-24.] This is 
not true. Hot Shots alleges that (1) Dr. Trepashko and Mr. Giba worked together to change the expected quantities for various 
drugs in the RFP to ensure that Triad Isotopes would have the lowest bid among all bidders (which included Hot Shots), and (2) 
if the drug usage amounts in the RFP reflected actual usage instead of the deliberately skewed usage, Hot Shots' bid—which 
was the second-lowest overall—would have been approximately $300,000 less than Triad Isotopes' bid. [**55]  [Am. Compl., 88, 
at ¶¶ 64-69.] Hot Shots adequately pled causation. "
858,20," In a swing-for-the-fences moment, Defendant Trepashko also argues, more fundamentally, that Hot Shots failed to plead 
direct allegations of a conspiracy. [See 95, at 3-4.] But in addition to its express allegations of conspiracy [Am. Compl. 88, ¶¶ 55, 
70], Hot Shots pled a wealth of facts describing the agreement between Triad Isotopes, Mr. Giba, and Dr. Trepashko regarding 
the 2011 CCHHS contract [Id. ¶¶ 9, 60-65], which are consistent with Plaintiffs other allegations regarding the nefarious 
relationship between these Defendants. [Id. ¶¶ 18-19, 25-33.] Hot Shots sufficiently pled a conspiracy. "
859,21," In interpreting state statutes, the Court looks to decisions from the state's highest court for guidance. See Erie R.R. Co. v. 
Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 78, 58 S. Ct. 817, 82 L. Ed. 1188 (1938); Jean v. Dugan, 20 F.3d 255, 260 (7th Cir. 1994). ""In the "
860,," absence of guiding decisions by the state's highest court, [federal courts] consult and follow the decisions of intermediate [state] 
appellate courts unless there is a convincing reason to predict [that] the state's highest court would disagree."" ADT Sec. Servs., 
Inc. v. Lisle-Woodridge Fire Prot. Dist., 672 F.3d 492, 498 (7th Cir. 2012). "
869,1," For purposes of reviewing the pretrial orders on appeal, the evidence is recited in the light most favorable to Appellants. "
870,2," GRG alleges that even this communication was improper; the District maintains that reapportioning coefficients could not 
improve a vendor's score."
870,3," Lindsay testified that the District's goals in the 2008 RFP were, among others, ""to diversify the available skillsets of JOC 
vendors"" and ""to increase the number of minority-owned businesses within the JOC program."" Lindsay recommended adding 
FBM for the former kind of diversity and the other three companies for the latter. "
871,4," GRG also argues that there is evidence suggesting that RHJ was supposed to supplant GRG. The only evidence to which it 
directs us is the former procurement manager's obscure reference to ""substitut[ing] a supplier,"" but the context suggests he is 
referring to the improprieties with the 2008 vendor recommendations, not RHJ's later addition. GRG also identifies an email from 
an internal auditor referring to GRG's JOC proposal and admonishing ""the replacement JOC contractor to do their own scope 
and proposal."" The evidence also shows, however, that the program manager that handled GRG's contract testified that he 
never heard anyone refer to RHJ as a replacement contractor. The agenda item by which the Board approved the addition says 
it is ""to supplement"" the JOC program."
871,5," When asked whether he was involved in bribery schemes involving Marshall, Aguirre invoked his Fifth Amendment right 
against self-incrimination."
871,6," GRG identifies no specific defects within the report, the purpose of which was to urge conformity to established procedures, not 
to change them. "
873,7, GRG has not briefed and has therefore waived its claim for tortious interference with an existing contract.
873,8," Following Pinnacle Brands, 138 F.3d at 606, the district court referred to this as ""RICO Act standing."" HN8[
] Although 
whether a legislative enactment authorizes a plaintiff to sue is sometimes referred to as ""statutory standing,"" courts should avoid 
using that term. See Lexmark Int'l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., 134 S. Ct. 1377, 1387-88, 188 L. Ed. 2d 392 & n.4 
(2014) (""statutory standing"" is a misleading label ""since 'the absence of a valid . . . cause of action does not implicate subject-
matter jurisdiction'"") (quoting Verizon Md., Inc. v. Pub. Serv. Comm'n of Md., 535 U.S. 635, 642-43, 122 S. Ct. 1753, 1758, 152 
L. Ed. 2d 871 (2002)). "
874,9," Marshall cites this case for the proposition that ""the denial of a government contract that plaintiff expected to receive, but for a 
competitor's alleged bribery of public officials, did not give rise to a cognizable RICO injury."" What he fails to mention in his brief 
is that our sister court explicitly found that the plaintiff ""would not have been awarded the [government] contract regardless."" 
1991 U.S. App. LEXIS 12209, [WL] at *2. "
875,10," After oral argument, Appellants called to our attention an internal audit HISD released on March 10, 2015. While it may be true 
that ""this report contradicts HISD's position in this case that their re-bid of JOC contracts cleaned up the demonstrated favoritism 
shown in 2008,"" GRG still does not challenge the facts that the 2010 re-bid was an appropriate response, or that GRG would not 
have been selected."
875,11," By noting two particular issues that will be pertinent on remand, we do not presume to eliminate others raised by the 
Appellees. First, HN13[
] RICO claims require showing that the unlawful behavior proximately caused the plaintiff's injuries. Holmes v. Sec. Investor Prot. Corp., 503 U.S. 258, 268, 112 S. Ct. 1311, 1317, 117 L. Ed. 2d 532 (1992). A threat to a finding of 
proximate cause here may lie in HISD's use of third-party project managers to administer its JOC assignments. The factfinder 
will have to determine whether GRG's injury ""flows"" from the RICO violations. Khurana v. Innovative Health Care Sys., Inc., 
130 F.3d 143, 150 (5th Cir. 1997), abrogated on other grounds by Beck v. Prupis, 529 U.S. 494, 120 S. Ct. 1608, 146 L. Ed. 2d 
561 (2000). Second, the permissible scope and extent of damages is also a matter for the district court to determine on remand. 
GRG's expert estimates the company lost 18 jobs—JOC assignments GRG would have received but for Marshall's improper 
influence—totaling $177,307. Based on the same data, a defense expert calculated the range of damages between $16,776.76 
and $145,032.96. The defendants also challenge the reliability and thus admissibility of GRG's expert report."
875,12," Several district courts in this circuit have also recognized ""strong authority that governmental entities, such as counties or 
government agencies, cannot be proper RICO defendants."" Dale v. Mo. Governor Jay Nixon's Office, No. CIV.A. C-11-114, 2011 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 50304, 2011 WL 1810321, at *3 (S.D. Tex. May 10, 2011); see also Nationwide Pub. Ins. Adjusters Inc. v. 
Edcouch-Elsa I.S.D., 913 F. Supp. 2d 305, 308 (S.D. Tex. 2012); Dammon v. Folse, 846 F. Supp. 36, 38 (E.D. La. 1994); La. 
Power & Light Co. v. United Gas Pipe Line Co., 642 F. Supp. 781, 806 (E.D. La. 1986). "
876,13," Either of these theories—the inability to form a mens rea or immunity from punitive damages—might suffice to remove HISD 
from RICO's ambit in this case. There are also sound policy reasons for this conclusion: [T]he . . . theories for refusing to hold a municipal entity liable under RICO are not mutually exclusive—indeed, it can be 
said that they are two sides of the same concept. In an abstract but doctrinal sense, a corporation in and of itself cannot 
form mens rea. Similarly, a corporation, that is, the institutional construct itself, cannot be deterred; deterrence [**25]  can 
only be achieved by targeting the behavior of the people who determine corporate conduct. Thus, if punitive damages 
would not operate to encourage innocent and essentially powerless taxpayers to prevent RICO's condemned activity by 
municipal officials, short of the election process, it would seem inappropriate to hold the municipal corporation liable. Dammon, 846 F. Supp. at 38."
876,14," When the Supreme Court held that municipal entities were liable under federal antitrust law, it ""understandably [left] open the 
question whether municipalities may be liable for treble damages[.]"" [**26]  Cmty. Commc'ns Co. v. City of Boulder, Colo., 455 
U.S. 40, 65, 102 S. Ct. 835, 848, 70 L. Ed. 2d 810 (1982) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting). Before there was occasion for the high 
court to resolve that question, Congress exempted governmental units from all monetary damages. Local Government Antitrust 
Act of 1984, Pub. L. No. 98-544, 98 Stat. 2750 (1984), codified at 15 U.S.C. §§ 34-36 "
877,15," Albeit in non-precedential opinions, the Third Circuit has continued to apply Genty since PacifiCare was decided. Tengood v. 
City of Philadelphia, 529 F. App'x 204, 209 n.4 (3d Cir. 2013) (unpublished) (rejecting argument that PacifiCare abrogated 
Genty); Heinemeyer v. Twp. of Scotch Plains, 198 F. App'x 254, 256 (3d Cir. 2006); Kadonsky v. New Jersey, 188 F. App'x 81, 
85 (3d Cir. 2006). See also Cranberry Promenade, Inc. v. Cranberry Twp., No. CIV. A. 09-1242, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15077, 
2010 WL 653915, at *4 (W.D. Pa. Feb. 22, 2010)."
877,16," HISD urges several grounds to reject the contract claim other than those on which the district court relied. We need not and do 
not address these arguments. "
878,17," GRG argues that the district court dismissed its estoppel claims ""on the basis that GRG had a contract with HISD. But if the 
Court holds that no contract claim is stated, it should necessarily reinstate GRG's estoppel and quasi-estoppel claims."" However, 
HN21[
] it is the existence of a contract that makes estoppel inappropriate, not the viability of any contract claim. Further, GRG 
pressed only quasi-estoppel in its reply brief."
878,18," In affirming these conclusions, we, like the district court, reserve judgment on whether public entities like HISD can be held 
liable at all under theories of estoppel. Texas law generally immunizes municipalities from estoppel for governmental (as 
opposed to proprietary) functions, but the decisions seem to be split over whether a school district ever exercises [**32]  
proprietary functions. Compare S.W. ex rel. A.W. v. Arlington Indep. Sch. Dist., 435 S.W.3d 414, 421 & n.10 (Tex. App. 2014), 
with Galveston Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Clear Lake Rehab. Hosp., L.L.C., 324 S.W.3d 802, 809 (Tex. App. 2010). And while Texas 
courts have contemplated exceptions in certain extreme cases, see Bowman v. Lumberton Indep. Sch. Dist., 801 S.W.2d 883, 
888 (Tex. 1990); City of Hutchins v. Prasifka, 450 S.W.2d 829, 835-36 (Tex. 1970), we decline to explore the scope of these 
exceptions except to note that the cases address estoppel to deny agency, normally in the employment context. See, e.g., 
Hudspeth v. Chapel Hill I.S.D., No. 03-06-00243-CV, 2007 Tex. App. LEXIS 4506, 2007 WL 1647818, at *4 (Tex. App. June 8, 
2007); La Villa Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Gomez Garza Design, Inc., 79 S.W.3d 217, 221 (Tex. App. 2002) (finding agency authority by 
estoppel); Bowman, 801 S.W.2d at 888. It is unhelpful to talk about ""estoppel"" simpliciter when the different types of estoppel 
implicate different analyses. "
879,19," HN27[
] The statute defines a ""professional employee of a school district"" to include ""a member of the board of trustees of an independent school district[.]"" Tex. Educ. Code § 22.051(a)(5). "
881,20," See also Lee v. Levi Strauss & Co., 897 S.W.2d 501 (Tex. App. 1995), in which a letter from the defendant led the plaintiff's 
employer to believe he had to fire the plaintiff. Id. at 504-05."
881,21," Appellees strenuously contend that GRG's claim also fails for lack of evidence that it would have become a JOC contractor 
following the 2010 RFP. This contention [**41]  was not addressed by the district court, and we do not address it either. 
Assessing the ""likelihood"" of ""prospective business relations"" under Texas law suggests different considerations than the RICO 
inquiry we discussed earlier herein, which is whether HISD ""would have"" entered into a 2010 JOC arrangement with GRG."
881,22," At the outset, we reject HISD's unpalatable argument that there was no disparate treatment since all vendors were given an 
opportunity to bribe a trustee. "
882,23, We do not reach HISD's assertion that these § 1983 claims do not justify imposing municipal liability. 
885,1," Swisher does not raise any other aspect of the antitrust claims, and the Court expresses no opinion beyond the issue of 
antitrust injury. "
887,2," Swisher argues that the pleading standard for Florida defamation claims is the same as that for trade libel claims because the 
claims have the same elements. (See Mot. J. Pleadings 12-14.) "
892,*," Pursuant to 5TH CIR. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except 
under the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH CIR. R. 47.5.4. "
893,1," Working interests are cost-bearing interests, unlike ORRIs. "
894,2," Although the antitrust claim in this case was brought under Mississippi law, the parties agree that Mississippi antitrust claims 
are ""analytically identical"" to federal antitrust claims; therefore, Plaintiffs lack standing to maintain their Mississippi antitrust claim 
if they lack standing under federal antitrust law. Thus, we analyze their claim under federal law."
894,4," Both the district court and Waggoner's brief quote the following from Bell v. Dow Chemical Co.: ""In making the determination, 
courts may assess several factors: 1) the nature of plaintiff's alleged injury; 2) the directness of the [**7]  injury; 3) the 
speculative measure of the harm; 4) the risk of duplicative recovery; and 5) the complexity in apportioning damages."" 847 F.2d 
1179, 1183 (5th Cir. 1988). While these factors are indeed appropriate in the overall standing inquiry, the antitrust-injury standing 
requirement is analogous to the first Dow factor: the nature of the plaintiff's injury. This is evident from Dow's citation to 
Brunswick for the proposition that, ""[r]egarding the first factor, plaintiff's injury must be the type that the antitrust laws were 
intended to prevent,"" id."
894,3," HN4[
] This antitrust injury requirement of antitrust standing is sometimes confused with ""injury to competition[,] . . . which is 
often a component of substantive liability."" Doctor's Hosp., 123 F.3d at 305. In the standing context, injury ""should be viewed 
from the perspective of the plaintiff's position in the marketplace, not from the merits-related perspective of the impact of a 
defendant's conduct on overall competition."" Id. In this opinion, ""antitrust injury"" refers only to the antitrust standing requirement. "
895,5," We cite the district court opinion for these facts and not for its reasoning because our opinion deals with numerous issues and 
therefore provides a limited discussion of the antitrust claim. See Bailey, 609 F.3d at 727."
895,6," Waggoner attempts to analogize this case to McCready. In that case, a beneficiary of an insurance policy purchased by her 
employer alleged that the insurance company's practice of denying coverage for treatment by psychologists while covering 
treatment by psychiatrists was part of a conspiracy to restrain competition in the market. 457 U.S. at 467. The defendants 
argued that the plaintiff lacked antitrust standing because her injury did not ""reflect the 'anticompetitive' effect of the alleged"" 
conspiracy, stressing that she did not claim that psychiatry costs were higher because of the alleged conspiracy. Id. at 481-82. 
The Court disagreed, finding she had standing because she was forced into the ""Hobson's choice"" of being treated by a 
psychiatrist and forfeiting reimbursement or forgoing treatment by the practitioner of her choice. Id. at 483. The Court held her 
injury ""was inextricably intertwined with the injury the conspirators sought [**11]  to inflict on psychologists and the 
psychotherapy market."" Id. at 484. The most salient distinction between McCready and the instant case is that Waggoner is not a consumer, directly or indirectly, in 
the CO2 market. Moreover, the alleged antitrust behavior in that case was the pressure on subscribers to choose treatment from 
psychiatrists rather than psychologists to limit competition against psychiatrists. Id. Here Waggoner's alleged injury stems from 
the monopolist's power to ""control price or exclude competition."" The Defendant's sale of CO2 for low prices is hardly the type of 
harm that ""Congress sought to redress in providing a private remedy for"" antitrust violations, id. at 483. "
896,7," The Mississippi Supreme Court has not spoken on whether a civil-conspiracy claim can stand where no underlying [**13]  tort 
is alleged. See Wells, 217 F. Supp. 2d at 755 (surveying other states' laws)."
896,8," In Aiken, it was unclear what tort the conspiracy claim was based on, but the Court assumed it was fraud. 333 F. App'x at 812."
896,9," The complaint states: Defendants herein, have conspired to create a fraudulent scheme, by which Denbury [**14]  has been underpaying CO2 
royalty owners in the Jackson Dome, including the Plaintiffs, and as part of their fraudulent scheme, the Defendants have 
been over-charging working interest owners for CO2 used in the tertiary recovery oil fields operated by Denbury in

918,74," As already illustrated in our brief review of the meaning of ""anticompetitive,"" there is no practical difference between the terms 
anticompetitive conduct and anticompetitive [**26]  effects as used in the caselaw, because we do not deem conduct 
anticompetitive unless it has a net anticompetitive effect."
918,75," Memorial Hermann argues that our decision in Irving Healthcare Sys. v. Brooks, 927 S.W.2d 12 (Tex. 1996), forecloses 
argument that section 160.007(b)'s anticompetitive action exception encompasses routine [**27]  business torts, including 
interference with prospective business relations. In Brooks, we noted that ""the statute provides that if a court makes a 
preliminary finding that a medical peer review committee's proceedings, records, or communications are relevant to an 
anticompetitive action . . . they are not confidential,"" but that ""a similar provision for a libel action in which the plaintiff claims 
malice"" was ""[n]oticeably absent from the statute."" 927 S.W.2d at 16. We also held that the statute did not ""explicitly exclude 
from its confidentiality provisions any of [the plaintiff's] other causes of action."" Id. The plaintiff in Brooks sued for libel, slander, ""intentional infliction of mental anguish,"" and interference with business relations. 
Id. at 14-15. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant had ""intentionally and maliciously supplied false information, thereby 
damaging or destroying [the plaintiff's] ability to gain admittance to the medical staffs of the hospitals to which he applied."" Id. 
Thus, Brooks did not require us to review the applicability of subsection (b), because the trial court never made the required 
preliminary finding of relevance to an anticompetitive action. Furthermore, although the plaintiff's [**28]  ""other causes of action,"" 
included an allegation that the defendant tortiously interfered with prospective business relations, the plaintiff did not allege that 
the conduct was independently wrongful because the provision of false information had a negative effect on competition and 
constituted an antitrust violation. Our decision today is therefore consistent with our holding in Brooks."

concerns raised by the data. It may be that such increased [**47]  responsiveness is of greater value than the interim damage to 
a physician's reputation. As we have already discussed, the inclusion and wording of the anticompetitive exception to the medical peer review committee 
privilege does not condition the exception on a pre-determination that the behavior at issue is indeed anticompetitive. It requires 
only that the action seeks to establish that the behavior is anticompetitive. This case presents itself to us at the discovery phase 
rather than summary judgment. The procompetitive value of allowing for the presentation of false data is a factual 
determination—one likely requiring the aid of expert reports—and it is not a determination that we can make as a matter of law."

945,12," Memantine is an N-Methyl D-Aspartate (""NMDA"") receptor antagonist that affects the glutamate pathway in the brain. As 
expert Dr. Alan Jacobs, a neurologist in private practice, explained at the preliminary injunction hearing: Neurons in the brain communicate by signaling each other. Some of these [**15]  signals are transmitted through an influx 
of calcium into a molecule on the surface of neurons called the NMDA receptor. This influx of calcium is triggered when 
glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter, docks at the NMDA receptor, causing the calcium influx. When patients enter the 
moderate stage of Alzheimer's disease, there can be overexcitation of the NMDA receptor by glutamate. S.A. 16. Memantine-based drugs, like Namenda, partially block the brain's NMDA receptor in order to prevent ""overexcitation"" of 
that receptor, ""which can cause toxicity to neurons in the brain."" S.A. 17. In contrast, the three other FDA-approved drugs on the market to treat Alzheimer's disease—Aricept, Exelon, and Razadyne—
are all acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (""CIs""). CIs reduce the breakdown of acetylcholine, a chemical messenger that transmits 
information between nerve cells, in the brain. Rather than work on the glutamate pathway, like Namenda, CIs work on the 
acetylcholine pathway. CIs are generally prescribed to patients experiencing the early stage of Alzheimer's disease, and are 
prescribed in conjunction with—but not independently of—Namenda during the moderate-to-severe stages of Alzheimer's 
disease. [**16]"

defendant's conduct. Here, there is no genuine dispute that Defendants intended to avoid the patent cliff. See, e.g., J.A. 132, 
155."
951,26," Several other courts have held that product redesign violates § 2 when combined with other conduct and the combined effect 
is anticompetitive or exclusionary. See Allied Orthopedic, 592 F.3d at 1000 (explaining that § 2 is violated when ""some conduct 
of the monopolist associated with its introduction of a new and improved product design constitutes an anticompetitive abuse or 
leverage of monopoly power, or a predatory or exclusionary means of attempting to monopolize the relevant market"" (internal

951,27," As previously noted, the other available Alzheimer's drugs, all CIs, are not substitutes for Namenda because they perform

952,28," Alternatively, patients could discontinue memantine-therapy entirely."
952,29," Formularies, tiered-drug structures, step programs, and prior-authorization requirements are all tools that third-party payors 
may use to incentivize patients to take less-expensive drugs. A formulary is a list of approved drugs [**40]  that a health plan will 
pay for, either in whole or in part. S.A. 19. A tiered-drug structure divides the drugs listed on a plan's formulary into categories or 
""tiers."" S.A. 20. Typically, health plans use a three-tiered system, which reserves tier 1 for generic drugs, tier 2 for preferred 
branded drugs, and tier 3 for non-preferred branded drugs. The portion of the cost of the drug that the patient is responsible for 
paying, known as the ""co-payment"" or ""co-pay,"" increases with each tier. A step program requires a patient to first try a 
preferred, and usually less expensive, drug. Only if that treatment is unsuccessful will the health plan pay for the patient's drug of 
choice. S.A. 20. A prior authorization policy requires a patient to obtain the third-party payor's approval for payment prior to 
taking a particular drug. Antitrust Economists Br. at 14."
952,30," The district court found that the regulatory context makes it impractical and uneconomical for generic manufacturers to market 
their products to doctors or pharmacists because, among other reasons, marketing costs severely impact generic manufacturers' 
ability to offer the lower prices upon which they compete. S.A. 78. Two other district [**41]  courts confronted with product 
hopping cases concluded that plaintiffs plausibly alleged that the unique characteristics of the pharmaceutical industry ""make 
generic substitution the cost-efficient means of competing for companies selling generic pharmaceuticals."" In re Suboxone, 2014

953,31," The Department of Health and Human Services (""HHS"") reached this same conclusion, explaining: The unique nature of this patient population—Alzheimer's patients with moderate-to-severe dementia—makes it likely that a 
switch from the twice-daily Namenda IR to the once-daily Namenda XR would be a permanent one for practical purposes, 
as providers, patients, and families would be reluctant to switch back to twice-a-day therapy even if they believed that it 
represented a better value. HHS, Office of the Assistant Sec'y for Planning and Evaluation, Some Observations Related to the Generic Drug Market 5

""chemical equivalence,"" meaning that the drugs ""contain the same active ingredients and are identical in strength, dosage form 
and route of administration."" Pennwalt Corp. v. Zenith Labs., Inc., 472 F. Supp. 413, 417 (E.D. Mich. 1979). Oklahoma [**45]  
prohibits substitution ""without authority of the prescriber or purchaser,"" so we cannot determine whether generic IR will be 
substituted for Namenda XR under Oklahoma law. See Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 59, § 353.13(D). Of the states that allow pharmacists "
954,," to substitute generic drugs without consulting the prescribing physician, four states may—but will not necessarily—allow 
substitution of generic IR for Namenda XR. See Minn. Stat. Ann. § 151.21 Subd. 3; Minn. R. 9505.0340 Subp.3(H); N.D. Cent.

957,37," Given that we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in granting a preliminary injunction based on the harm 
to competition and economic harm to consumers, we need not consider whether the district court's findings related to medical 
harm to patients provided a basis for injunctive relief."
957,38," Defendants also argue that the district court erred in discounting the harm that they will suffer as a result of the injunction. We 
need not consider the balance of the hardships given that New York has demonstrated a substantial likelihood of success on the 
merits. In any event, we agree with the district court that the balance of the hardships tips decidedly in New York's favor. Defendants argue that they will be injured if they cannot convert patients to Namenda XR prior to July 2015, but that argument 
begets the question of whether their conduct [**57]  is lawful. Certainly, courts do not consider the harm a party suffers from 
being prevented from violating the law. Defendants also argue that they ""had stopped making IR batches and ha[d] been implementing plans to limit distribution for 
months."" Defs. Br. at 25. Ordering Defendants to manufacture IR, Defendants argue, impedes production of XR and delays the 
development of Namzaric, an even newer Alzheimer's drug, because the FDA has only certified one plant to produce IR, XR, 
and Namzaric. This argument is belied by the record. At the preliminary injunction hearing, one of Defendants' executives 
testified that the plant could manufacture IR while manufacturing XR. J.A. 533. Defendants also informed the district court that 
there was no cap on the amount of IR that would be supplied through Foundation Care and that the supply could be ""adjusted as 
necessary based on demand."" J.A. 904. Another of Defendants' experts testified that the ""biggest problem [Defendants] have 
with [manufacturing both IR and XR] is the labor force,"" but ""the equipment is completely different equipment."" J.A. 202. 
Defendants' expert clarified that they need skilled labor but, at most, he explained that there might [**58]  be some delay caused 
by training employees to use the new XR equipment where employees who had manufactured IR would be able to transition 
more quickly. J.A. 203. "
969,1," One of the named First-Level Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs is Alfred H. Siegel, the Liquidating Trustee of the Circuit City Stores, 
Inc. Liquidating Trust. Dkt. No. 400 ¶ 33. Circuit City Stores, Inc. is alleged to have ""indirectly purchased capacitors as stand-
alone products [**19]  and as components of products containing electrolytic and/or film capacitors from one or more of the 
Defendants."" Id. ¶ 34."
969,2," The complaint also asserts claims for violations of (iv) state antitrust and restraint of trade laws (""in the event that the Court 
does not apply California law on a nationwide basis""); and (v) state consumer protection and unfair competition laws (again ""in 
the event that the Court does not apply California law on a nationwide basis""). Dkt. No. 400 ¶¶ 380-412. Because the First-Level 
Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs are two California residents, two California companies and the trustee of a trust that was established 
in connection with the bankruptcy of a Virginia corporation, and because no Virginia state law claim is included in the fourth or 
fifth claims for relief, the Court deems all state claims other than those under California law to have been voluntarily dismissed 
by the indirect purchaser plaintiffs. "
979,3," For these same reasons, the Court finds as inapplicable defendants' state-specific arguments (which do not relate to either 
California or Virginia), and denies those arguments on that basis. Dkt. No. 474 at 27-31. "

992,4," On December 16, 2004, the United States Department of Justice filed an antitrust complaint against the EMMC after an 
eighteen-month investigation of the EMMC's membership activities, qualifications as a cooperative and marketing practices. See 
United States v. E. Mushroom Mktg. Coop., Inc., No. 04-5829 (E.D. Pa. Dec. 16, 2004). On September 9, 2005, the EMMC and 
the DOJ entered into a consent judgment that required the EMMC to nullify deed restrictions that had been placed on six 
properties that the EMMC had sold or transferred. See Dkt. No. 497, Ex. 21. The consent judgment also prohibited the EMMC 
from placing restrictions on other properties for ten years. Id."

502 (M.D. Basciani & Sons, Inc.s' Resps. To Pls.' Statement of Undisputed Facts) at 1-2. It contends instead that ""[d]uring the

which documents, [*29]  being in writing, speak for themselves."" Id."
993,7," Moving defendants also contend that the members of the EMMC ""voted to voluntarily abandon the Minimum Pricing Policy in 
August of 2005 . . . ."" Dkt. No. 492 (Defs.' Rule of Reason Mot.) at ¶ 12."
993,8," Plaintiffs argue that ""absent Capper-Volstead immunity, [d]efendants' conduct is simply naked price fixing subject to 
condemnation under the per se rule."" Dkt. No. 624 (Pls. Letter Br.) at 3. Moving defendants, in support of their motion seeking 
application of the rule of reason, assert that ""the DOJ concluded that the EMMC was an agricultural cooperative organized 
pursuant to the Capper-Volsted Act . . . and did not challenge the EMMC's Minimum Pricing Policy."" See Dkt. No. 492 (Defs.' 
Rule of Reason Mot.) at ¶ 12. I am not bound by the DOJ's conclusion with respect to the applicability of the Capper-Volsted Act 
immunity and, as is set forth below, have previously found that the protections of the Capper-Volsted Act were not available to "
994,," the EMMC. See In re Mushroom Direct Purchaser Antitrust Litig., 655 F.3d 158, 162 (3d Cir. 2011) (""Neither DOJ determination 
— that EMMC acted anticompetitively or that EMMC was a properly formed Capper-Volstead cooperative — is binding upon the 
District Court or th[e] Court [of Appeals].""). On March 26, 2009, after [*30]  the close of Phase I discovery, I denied certain defendants' motions for summary judgment and 
plaintiffs' cross motion for summary judgment on the issue of Capper-Volstead immunity. I found that the inclusion of Mario 
Cutone Mushroom Co. Inc. (M. Cutone), a non-grower distributor, in the EMMC's membership was sufficient to destroy Capper-
Volstead immunity. In re Mushroom Direct Purchaser Antitrust Litig., 621 F. Supp. 2d 274, 283-86 (E.D. Pa. 2009). I also found 
that the Act's exemption did not extend to protect cooperatives that conspire with entities not engaged in agricultural production 
as was the case with Kaolin/South Mill and its distribution entities and LRP-M/ Manfredini Enterprises. Id. at 286-91 (E.D. Pa. 
2009) (""for the EMMC and its members to fix prices with affiliated distributors when the distribution entities are not a single 
economic unit with their affiliated member grower constitutes a conspiracy that destroys the EMMC's Capper-Volsted 
exemption""). I denied defendants' request to certify my Order for appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b). Dkt. No. 315. 
Defendants then filed an interlocutory appeal which was dismissed by the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit on August 23, 
2011. The Court of Appeals found that a prejudgment order denying the protections of the Capper-Volstead Act was not a 
collateral [*31]  order subject to interlocutory appeal. In re Mushroom, 655 F.3d at 167. On January 6, 2014, certain defendants filed a motion seeking reconsideration of my March 26, 2009 Capper-Volstead decision. 
On October 14, 2014, I denied defendants' motion for reconsideration. In re Mushroom Direct Purchaser Antitrust Litig., 54 F. 
Supp. 3d 382, 395 (E.D. Pa. 2014). I found that neither American Needle, Inc. v. National Football League et al., 560 U.S. 183, 
130 S. Ct. 2201, 176 L. Ed. 2d 947 (2010), nor Deutscher Tennis Bund v. ATP Tour, Inc., 610 F.3d 820 (3d Cir. 2010), required 
reversal of my prior finding that the membership of M. Cutone in the EMMC destroyed the EMMC's immunity from antitrust 
liability under the Capper-Volstead Act. In re Mushroom, 54 F. Supp. 3d, at *390-91. I also found that reconsideration did not 
require reversal of my prior finding that EMMC member-grower Kaolin and the non-EMMC member South Mill distribution 
entities do not constitute a single economic entity. Id. at 388-89. I certified my reconsideration decision on the Capper-Volsted questions for interlocutory appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b). 
Id. at 394-95. On December 2, 2014, the Court of Appeals denied M.D. Basciani, Inc. and the EMMC's petitions for leave to file 
an interlocutory appeal. Dkt. No. 614."
994,9," The letter was produced pursuant to a ""limited waiver of the attorney-client privilege."" Dkt. No. 492 (Defs.' Rule of Reason 
Mem.) at 12 n. 3."
994,10," Of course, subsequent to this letter, the Court determined that not all of the EMMC members were producers given the 
inclusion of M. Cutone, a non-grower distributor, in the EMMC's membership, an inclusion that I found was sufficient to destroy 
Capper-Volstead [*35]  immunity. See In re Mushroom, 621 F. Supp. 2d at 289-90; see also In re Mushroom, 54 F. Supp. 3d at 
391 (""M. Cutone was a non-grower member [of the EMMC] who had the power to participate in the control and policymaking of "

requirements by asserting the single-entity defense in this context."")"
995,11," M. Cutone was a distributor for grower and non-EMMC member, non-defendant M&V Enterprises. Unlike the other EMMC 
members, it was not itself a grower of mushrooms."
995,12," ""LRP-M sold all of the mushrooms it grew to Manfredini Enterprises, its affiliated distributor."" In re Mushroom, 54 F. Supp. 3d 
at 389. To date, the Court has not been presented with facts which would be ""determinative of whether LRP-M and Manfredini 
Enterprises are separate decisionmakers pursuing separate economic interests."" [*37]  Id."

Stipulations of dismissal have been entered in the individual actions, and Creekside is currently working with the class plaintiffs 
to prepare a Motion for Preliminary Approval of the class settlement."" Dkt. No. 218 at ECF p. 2 n.3; see also Dkt. No. 213."
996,14," Moving defendants assert that ""many of the Defendants listed above resigned from the EMMC during the time period in 
question. Dkt. No. 505 (Defs.' Counter-Statement of Material Facts) at ¶ 27. Defendants contend that ""[t]hese resignations 
began shortly after the EMMC was formed, beginning with Defendants[] Cutone, M&T, and the Mushroom Alliance (including 
Country Fresh, Creekside, Kitchen Pride and JM)."" Id. at ¶ 27."
996,15," To-Jo Fresh Mushrooms, Inc. is an affiliate of EMMC member Brownstone Mushroom Farms. See Dkt. No. 497, Ex. 3 (Linda 
Pizzini Johnson Dep.) at 191:6-24 (explaining that ToJo was a packager/shipper and Brownstone was the grower)."
996,16," I previously decided that ""Kaolin/South Mill and its distribution entities are separate decisionmakers pursuing separate 
economic interests"" and that they ""cannot constitute a single entity . . . ."" In re Mushroom, 54 F. Supp. 3d at 389; see also In re 
Mushroom, 621 F. Supp. 2d at 279 (""The Kaolin/South Mill distribution centers were not EMMC members, did not grow 
mushrooms but sold mushrooms grown by defendant [*39]  Kaolin."")."
996,17," Except as is set forth herein, I will not here further specify whether any specific defendant was a grower-only, a distributor-only 
or an integrated grower-distributor because I find that questions of fact remain with respect to the organizational structure of 
many of the defendants. "
998,18," Continental Airlines was decided prior to the Supreme Court's decision in Leegin Creative Leather Products, Inc. v. PSKS, 
Inc., 551 U.S. 877, 882, 127 S. Ct. 2705, 168 L. Ed. 2d 623 (2007), which held that vertical price restraints, once found to be per 
se illegal, are to be ""judged by the rule of reason,"" as is further set forth herein. "
999,19," An abbreviated rule of reason analysis, ""quick look,"" is applied in those cases where the per se rule is inappropriate but where 
""no elaborate [*49]  industry analysis is required to demonstrate the anticompetitive character of an inherently suspect restraint."" 
Brown Univ., 5 F.3d at 669 (internal quotation marks omitted). The ""quick look"" analysis is used in cases where ""[s]ome 
restraints of trade are 'highly suspicious' yet 'sufficiently idiosyncratic that judicial experience with them is limited.'"" In re Ins. 
Brokerage Antitrust Litig., 618 F.3d 300, 317 (3d Cir. 2010), quoting 11 Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law ¶ 1911a (2d ed. 
2005). Under this ""intermediate"" standard, ""the competitive harm is presumed, and 'the defendant must promulgate some 
competitive justification' for the restraint."" Deutscher Tennis Bund, 610 F.3d at 830, quoting Brown Univ., 5 F.3d at 669. The 
Court presumes ""adverse competitive impact prevails and [] condemns the practice without ado"" if the defendant provides no 
legitimate competitive justifications, but ""must proceed to weigh the overall reasonableness of the restraint using a full-scale rule 
of reason analysis"" if ""sound procompetitive justifications"" are set forth. Deutscher Tennis Bund, 610 F.3d at 830, quoting Brown 
Univ., 5 F.3d at 669. Neither plaintiffs nor defendants have argued that a quick look analysis is warranted in this case. "
1000,20," In Dr. Miles Med. Co. v. John D. Park & Sons Co., 220 U.S. 373, 408, 31 S. Ct. 376, 55 L. Ed. 502 (1911), the plaintiff, a 
manufacturer of medicines, sold its products only to distributors who agreed to resell them at set prices. The Supreme Court 
found the manufacturer's control of resale prices to be unlawful, explaining that the pricing agreements would advantage 
the [*54]  distributors, not the manufacturer, and thus the arrangement was analogous to a combination among competing 
distributors, which the law treated as void. Dr. Miles, 220 U.S. at 407-08. "
1003,21," In reaching its conclusion in Insurance Brokerage, the Court also noted that the defendants were ""unable to identify among 
plaintiffs' allegations any procompetitive venture to which the insurers' alleged horizontal agreement not to compete for 
incumbent business could reasonably be deemed integral."" In re Ins. Brokerage, 618 F.3d at 346. In contrast in this case, 
defendants argue that ""there is substantial evidence that the EMMC member companies believed that the minimum pricing and 
supply control policies were necessary to prevent further farm closings and bankruptcies heralded by the bankruptcy of a large "

284, 298, 105 S. Ct. 2613, 86 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1985). ""[E]ven when the per se label has been applied to a category of 
anticompetitive conduct, the cases establish that courts may still look to see whether the economic effects of a particular [*73]  
practice in a particular industry justify abandoning a rule of reason analysis"" as the default position. Behrend v. Comcast Corp., 
No. 03-6604, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 51889, 2012 WL 1231794, at *11 (E.D. Pa. Apr. 12, 2012). Certain pro-competitive 
conditions ""can render an industry practice 'substantially different from the classic' horizontal restraints subjected to per se

citations omitted). Moving defendants argue that their price fixing conduct should be subject to the rule of reason because ""the historical 
procompetitive benefits of growers forming the EMMC [were] clear"": to ""salvage their farms and the mushroom industry as a 
whole"" during claimed dire market conditions. Dkt. No. 492 (Defs.' Rule of Reason Mem.) at 16-18. Plaintiffs assert that ""the "
1006,," EMMC agreement has no redeeming efficiency producing benefits and was admittedly implemented for the purpose of limiting 
competition."" Dkt. No. 624 (Pls.' Letter Br.) at 1-2. Plaintiffs argue that [d]efendants' horizontal conspiracy to fix prices and limit supply created neither a new product nor expanded production. . . . 
Nor did the EMMC integrate the abilities of its members in any way to create a new and more efficient way of competing. 
After joining the EMMC, [d]efendants remained separate competitors with separate brands, sales forces [*74]  and 
customers. . . . The only benefit of membership was that the EMMC fixed distribution prices and limited supply to keep 
prices high. Dkt. No. 624 (Pls.' Letter Br. at 3). I do not here decide that the procompetitive benefits argued by moving defendants are sufficient on their own to justify 
application of the rule of reason. I write only to note that the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit has held that ""[e]ven price 
fixing by agreement between competitors [and] . . . . other agreements that restrict competition . . . are governed by the rule of 
reason, rather than being per se illegal, if the challenged practice when adopted could reasonably have been believed to 
promote 'enterprise and productivity.'"" In re Sulfuric Acid, 703 F.3d at 1011-12, citing Broad. Music, Inc. v. Columbia Broad., 441 
U.S. 1, 24, 99 S. Ct. 1551, 60 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1979), and Polk Bros., Inc. v. Forest City Enters., Inc., 776 F.2d 185, 189 (7th Cir. 
1985). The Seventh Circuit has also held that ""[a] court must ask whether an agreement promoted enterprise and productivity at 
the time it was adopted. If it arguably did, then the court must apply the Rule of Reason."" Polk Bros., 776 F.2d at 189 (emphasis 
added); see also Procaps S.A. v. Patheon Inc., 36 F. Supp. 3d 1306, 1328 (S.D. Fla. 2014) (""[D]etermining whether an

render markets more, rather than less, competitive. . . . If the net plausible effects [*75]  might be procompetitive, then courts will 
apply the rule of reason to strike the balance."") (citations and internal quotations omitted). But cf. United States v. Socony-

1020,," the complaint, and no issue has been raised as to its authenticity. Therefore, the court will consider the GSA attached to 
defendants' motion to dismiss in considering the Rule 12(b)(6) motion. "
1021,7," The same analysis applies to the plaintiffs' Virginia Antitrust Act claim. Va. Code Ann. § 59.1-9.17; Stephen Jay Photography, 
Ltd. v. Olan Mills, Inc., 903 F.2d 988, 991 n.3 (4th Cir. 1990)."
1021,8," ""[A]n agreement among competitors on the way in which they will compete with one another."" NCAA v. Bd. of Regents of the 
Univ. of Okla., 468 U.S. 85, 99, 104 S. Ct. 2948, 82 L. Ed. 2d 70 (1984). "
1023,9," Plaintiffs argue that the no-hire agreement in Eichom was limited to a period of eight months following the sale of the company, 
and that the GSA is not so limited. But that argument misses the point of the GSA. To be sure, the GSA itself is not time-limited, 
but all it does is bind Berkley Group and Bluegreen to honor valid [*16]  restrictive covenants in each other's employment 
contracts. The non-competition provision in the Berkley Group employment contracts is limited to one year, and the non-
solicitation and confidentiality provisions to two years. In substance, the GSA does little more than bind Berkley Group and 
Bluegreen not to tortiously interfere with valid employment contracts. Given the context in which the GSA arose, to settle just 
such lawsuits, the GSA is not properly subject to the per se rule. "
1024,10," Nor does the ""quick look"" method of analysis apply here. ""'Quick look' is essentially an abbreviated form of rule of reason 
analysis, to be used in cases in which the likelihood of anticompetitive effects is so obvious that 'an observer with even a 
rudimentary understanding of economics could conclude that the arrangements in question would have an anticompetitive effect 
on customers and markets.'"" Madison Square Garden, L.P. v. Nat'l Hockey League, 270 F. App'x 56, 58 (2d Cir. 2008) (quoting 
Cal. Dental Ass'n v. FTC, 526 U.S. 756, 770, 119 S. Ct. 1604, 143 L. Ed. 2d 935 (1999))."
1024,11," Defendants [*23]  filed a partial motion to dismiss the original complaint, asking the court to find that plaintiffs' claim that the 
per se rule or quick look approach did not apply to this case. After briefing on argument, the court did just that, stating as follows: "
1025,," [T]his is not a naked, horizontal restraint of trade. This is not horizontal market allocation. This is not bid-rigging. This is not 
price fixing. This is not an agreement to exchange customers. This is an ancillary restraint of trade, if you call it that, that is 
resulting from the settlement of a lawsuit over non-competes. And it seems to me that all this thing does is — the 
agreement says we're not going to violate the law. We won't break the law by stealing your customers if you agree not to 
break the law by stealing my customers. Trans. of April 3, 2014 Hearing, Dkt. No. 60, at 3. At that juncture, defendants did not challenge the legal sufficiency of the 
complaint under the rule of reason. Following the filing of the amended complaint, defendants did so, which the court addresses 
herein. "
1030,1," Subject-matter jurisdiction is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1331. Citations to the record filings are ""R."" followed by the docket 
number and then a page or paragraph number. "
1032,2," Overcharges as far back as February 10, 2000—just 40 days after the merger—may also be recoverable. The Class filed its 
complaint on August 7, 2007. Compl. That would ordinarily only allow the Class to reach back to 2003, but 15 U.S.C. § 16(i) tolls 
private rights of action whenever overlapping government cases are pending: ""[w]henever any civil or criminal proceeding is 
instituted by the United States to prevent, restrain, or punish violations of any of the antitrust laws ... the running of the statute of 
limitations in respect to every private or State right of action arising under said laws and based in whole or in part on any matter 
complained of in said proceeding shall be suspended during the pendency thereof and for one year thereafter."" Here, the 
Federal Trade Commission ""instituted"" a proceeding against NorthShore based on the merger on February 10, 2004. So the 
limitations period for all related ""right[s] of action"" that existed on that date, including the Class's, were then ""suspended"" until the 
FTC action resolved. The FTC action lasted until well after the Class filed. Case Timeline, Federal Trade Commission, available 
at 
https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/cases-proceedings/0110234/evanston-northwestern-healthcare-corporation-enh-medical-
group . So, in short, whatever rights the Class had 40 days after the merger, were likely still around when the Class filed its 
complaint."
1032,3," It is worth noting that the Seventh Circuit often relies on the two leading antitrust commentators mentioned earlier in the 
opinion, and those commentators approve of the Berkey accrual rule. Areeda & Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law § 320c4 
(""[C]ustomers of the monopolist are not injured until after the monopolist causes them injury through higher prices."")."
1032,4," Taylor's treatment of Berkey exemplifies how courts have had a hard time categorizing the case. Taylor, with its reference to 
""continuing wrongs,"" appears to consider Berkey a continuing-violation-doctrine case. 712 F.2d at 1118. Other courts identify 
Berkey as a straight-forward application of the rule from Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 401 U.S. 321, 338-40, 
91 S. Ct. 795, 28 L. Ed. 2d 77 (1971), which is that ""the cause of action for future damages, if they ever occur, will accrue only 
on the date they are suffered."" See Rite Aid Corp. v. Am. Exp. Travel Related Servs. Co., 708 F. Supp. 2d 257, 267 (E.D.N.Y. 
2010) (""Berkey's purchaser accrual rule is based on the rationale that a purchaser's damages for paying overcharges are 
'entirely speculative' until the purchaser actually pays the overcharge.""). "
1034,5," Discovery was open for all purposes from, at the latest, March 11, 2008, until it was stayed on April 6, 2010. R. 56, Scheduling 
Order (""Full discovery will commence immediately upon entry of this order.""); R. 388, Discovery Stay. That period is 756 days. 
Discovery was reopened on December 16, 2013. R. 588. From then until the motion for summary judgment, R. 675, was filed on 
April 10, 2015, was an additional 480 days. "
1037,1, The Texas Free Enterprise and Antitrust Act is codified under Chapter 15 of the Texas Business and Commerce Code.
1037,2," Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas is a division of Health Care Service Corporation, an Illinois Mutual Legal Reserve 
Company, with its principal place of business located in Chicago, Illinois. See Doc. No. 1 at 2. For diversity jurisdiction purposes, 
Defendant is not considered a citizen of Texas. See Hesse v. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas, No. 4:11-CV-362, 2011 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 102012, 2011 WL 4025453, at *2 (E.D. Tex. Aug. 15, 2011), report and recommendation adopted, No. 4:11-CV-362, 
2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 102001, 2011 WL 4025514 (E.D. Tex. Sept. 9, 2011) (""In this case, it is clear that Defendant is a division 
of HCSC, an Illinois corporation, with its principal place of business in Illinois. Therefore, Defendant is not a citizen of Texas for 
diversity purposes, diversity does exist between the parties . . . ."")."
1037,3," The Petition references an exhibit containing a comprehensive list of the medical care and treatment Plaintiff allegedly provided 
to BCBS insureds. In the Petition filed with the Court, Plaintiff states that the foregoing exhibit ""will be produced under separate 
cover to the Defendant's attorney of record, and is not filed with the Court."" (PETITION at 3). "
1038,4," The section of the Petition titled ""Insurance Code Violations"" includes claims under Texas Insurance Code §§ 541.051, 
541.052, and 541.056, along with claims under the Texas Business and Commerce Code § 17.46 (titled Deceptive Trade 
Practices Unlawful) and 28 Texas Administrative Code § 19.1724. For the reasons stated below, Plaintiffs claims under 28 
Texas Administrative Code § 19.1724 are dismissed, because that section is no longer a part of the code. "
1039,5," BCBS also references Lone Star Fund V (U.S.), L.P. v. Barclays Bank PLC, 594 F.3d 383 (5th Cir. 2010), which offers little 
support for its argument that Rule 9(b) applies to Plaintiff's negligent misrepresentation claim. In Lone Star, the Court found that 
the claims ""sound[ed] in fraud and negligent misrepresentation,"" and that Rule 9(b) applied because the plaintiff did not urge a 
separate focus on the negligent misrepresentation claim. Id. at 387 n.3. There, the complaint pleaded with particularity the exact 
representations the plaintiff claimed were false. Id. Here—as BCBS argues—Plaintiff has not pleaded with particularity the exact 
representations it claims are false. "
1041,6," In affirming the district court's ruling on a separate claim for tortious interference with existing business relations, the Court 
mentioned ""that entering into an exclusive agreement, in and of itself, does constitute an unreasonable restraint on trade."" 
Apani, 300 F.3d at 634. Nothing in the opinion indicates that this statement was the basis for affirming the district court's 
dismissal of the antitrust claim at issue."
1041,7," BCBS cites the Tampa Electric test as applied by the Court in Apani. In Apani, the plaintiff alleged antitrust claims under 
Section 3 of the Clayton Act and Section 15.05(c) of the Texas Business and Commerce Code. See Apani Southwest, Inc. v. 
Coca-Cola Enters., No. 5:00-CV-228, Doc. No. 3 (N.D. Tex. Aug. 2, 2000)."
1041,8," In fact, both Section 3 of the Clayton Act and Section 15.05(c) of the Texas Business and Commerce Code only apply to 
contracts involving the sale or lease of goods. Section 15.05(c) provides in pertinent part: `It is unlawful for any person to sell, 
lease, or contract for the sale or lease of any goods, whether patented or unpatented, for use, consumption, or resale or to fix a 
price for such use, consumption, or resale or to discount from or rebate upon such price . . . . `Tex. Bus. & Com. Code Ann. § 
15.05(c). Other Courts have reached the same conclusion in the context of Section 3 of the Clayton Act. Tri—State Broadcasting 
Co. v. United Press Intern., Inc., 369 F.2d 268, 269 (5th Cir. 1966); see also Marion Healthcare LLC v. S. Illinois Healthcare, No. 
12-CV-871, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 120722, 2013 WL 4510168, at *6-7 (S.D. Ill. Aug. 26, 2013) (dismissing Section 3 claims 
against health insurer because ""[t]he dominant nature of the transaction at issue is surely services . . . .""). "
1043,9," It is unclear how Plaintiff could confer any benefits upon BCBS under these circumstances. See Electrostim Med. Servs., Inc. v. 
Health Care Serv. Corp., 962 F. Supp. 2d 887, 899 (S.D. Tex. 2013) (dismissing quantum meruit claim based on healthcare 
services provided to beneficiaries of a healthcare insurance policy); see also Travelers Indem. Co. of Connecticut v. Losco Grp., 
Inc., 150 F. Supp. 2d 556, 563 (S.D.N.Y. 2001) (""It is counterintuitive to say that services provided to an insured are also 
provided to its insurer. The insurance company derives no benefit from those services; indeed, what the insurer gets is a ripened 
obligation to pay money to the insured—which hardly can be called a benefit.""). "
1054,1," The members of the TMB have not yet made an appearance in their individual capacities. Only the TMB and its members in 
their official capacities filed a response to the application for a preliminary injunction. The Court refers herein to both the TMB 
and its members in their official capacities as the TMB. "
1055,2," According to Teladoc, its physicians do not prescribe ""DEA-controlled substances (including narcotics) or what are referred to 
as lifestyle drugs (i.e., Viagra, or diet pills)."" (Compl. ¶ 81). "
1060,3," The TMB also suggests the proper standard for reviewing its justification is whether its ""conclusions are so baseless that no 
reasonable medical practitioner could have reached those conclusions after reviewing the same set of facts."" Willman v. 
Heartland Hosp. E., 34 F.3d 605, 611 (8th Cir. 1994). At issue in Willman, however, was whether specific corrective action 
against a physician violated antitrust laws if the physician's peer reviewers had legitimate medical reasons to believe that the 
physician provided substandard care. TMB's reliance on Willman in this case is simply not appropriate. "
1067,1," ""[W]hereas lack of antitrust standing affects a plaintiff's ability to recover, but does not implicate the subject matter jurisdiction 
of the court[,]"" Sullivan v. DB Investments, Inc., 667 F.3d 273, 307 (3d Cir. 2011) (internal citations and quotation marks 
omitted), I will not consider the remaining standing elements sua sponte. "

casino not to deal with Plaintiffs' MMA promotion"" Harrah's mot. to dismiss, doc. no. 53, 8; See Valley Forge's mot. to dismiss, 
doc. no. 47, 17."
1068,3," ""Exclusive dealing exists when a buyer and seller enter into an agreement in which the buyer will only purchase goods or 
services from that one seller and the agreement forecloses competition."" BanxCorp v. Bankrate, Inc., 07-CV-3398, 2009 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 84151, 2009 WL 2986126, at *4 (D.N.J. Sept. 14, 2009) (citing Barr Laboratories, Inc. v. Abbott Laboratories, 978 
F.2d 98, 110 (3d Cir.1992). The venue agreement allegedly [*12]  provides that the casinos will purchase MMA promotion 
services from CFFC and no other fight promotor. This foreclosed all other fight promotors from holding MMA events at the 
casinos, and is exclusive dealing. "
1069,4," An amendment to CFFC's contract with Harrah's provides CFFC with a right to first refusal for any MMA event to be scheduled 
at Chester Downs between August 27, 2013 and March 7, 2014. Harrah's mot. to dismiss am. compl., doc. no. 48, Ex. C."
1069,5," In response to defendants' motion, plaintiffs assert he alleged a price fixing scheme. The only allegation of price fixing is 
between CFFC and XFE. How such price fixing could occur after CFFC and XFE merged is questionable. In any event, plaintiffs 
do not allege that the promotors conspired with the casinos to fix prices. "
1070,6," ""There are other casinos in Pennsylvania, Delaware and New Jersey .... None are considered or explained in the context of the 
supply and demand conditions in Plaintiffs' alleged product market definition. Nor is there any discussion of non-casino venues, 
such as Plaintiffs' current venue, that can host MMA events. Valley Forge's Mot. to Dismiss, doc. no 47-1, 20."
1070,7," Defendants also complain that plaintiffs do not consider boxing events in their market definition. I disagree. Plaintiffs' product 
definition is broad enough to include boxing matches, i.e. a combat sport which features two competitors fighting inside an 
enclosed area. Am. compl ¶ 66. "
1071,8," To the extent plaintiffs assert an attempt to monopolize claim under section 1 of the Sherman Act, the claim is dismissed. An 
attempt to monopolize claim only exists under section 2 of the Sherman Act."
1071,9," To the extent plaintiffs plead a conspiracy to attempt to monopolize, such a claim does not exist. IIIB, Phillip Areeda and 
Herbert Hoovenkamp, Antitrust Law ¶809 (3d ed. 2006) (""An occasional complaint has alleged that the defendant conspired to 
attempt to monopolize. Courts have correctly held that §2 states no such offense. Nor is there any need for it, because the 
combination that offends antitrust policy violates § 1."") "
1072,10," I have federal question jurisdiction over plaintiffs' antitrust claims. 28 U.S.C. § 1331. I have supplemental jurisdiction over the 
pendent state law claims. § 1367. When considering the motions to dismiss the state law counts, I must apply Pennsylvania law 
as interpreted by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. McKenna v. Pac. Rail Serv., 32 F.3d 820, 825 (3d Cir. 1994) (citing Erie 
R.R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 58 S. Ct. 817, 82 L. Ed. 1188 (1938)) (""In so doing, we are not free to impose our own view 
of what state law should be; we are to apply state law as interpreted by the state's highest court.""); Parkway Garage, Inc. v. City 
of Philadelphia, 5 F.3d 685, 701 (3d Cir. 1993) (applying Erie to claims under supplemental jurisdiction). When the Supreme 
Court has not spoken on the issue, I refer to the decisions of the Pennsylvania Superior Court and Pennsylvania 
Commonwealth [*25]  Court to predict how the high court would rule. See McKenna, 32 F.3d at 825. Additionally, I will follow 
Third Circuit's interpretation of Pennsylvania law unless it is inconsistent with a subsequent holding of the state Supreme or 
intermediate appellate courts. Aceto v. Zurich Ins. Co., 440 F.2d 1320, 1322 (3d Cir. 1971) (""No one may properly rely upon 
what we have held as more than persuasive on a question of Pennsylvania law so long as the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has 
not ruled upon that legal question.""); Largoza v. Gen. Elec. Co., 538 F. Supp. 1164, 1166 (E.D. Pa. 1982) (""[I]t is axiomatic that 
this court is bound by a decision of the Third Circuit predicating Pennsylvania law unless the state supreme court issues a 
contrary decision or it appears from a subsequent decision of the appellate courts that the court of appeals erred.""). "
1204,1," In most of the Pending Cases, Defendants have filed two separate motions to dismiss. The Defendants affiliated with GEICO 
typically filed their own motion [*422]  to dismiss, although their motion is joined by the CSAA Insurance Group Defendants in 
the Arizona and California cases and the MetLife Defendants in the Arizona case. With the exception of Oregon, all remaining "
1205,," Defendants in each case have filed a ""joint motion"" to dismiss. In the Michigan case (6:14-cv-6007) and one of the Pennsylvania 
cases (6:14-cv-6020), no GEICO Defendant is a party so all Defendants have joined the joint motion. When discussing specific 
motions, the Court will refer to the Defendants who joined GEICO's motion as the ""GEICO Defendants"" and the Defendants who 
joined the joint motion as the ""Non-GEICO Defendants."" Two defendants in the Oregon case (6:14-cv-6014) have filed their own motions to dismiss. Defendant American Commerce 
Insurance Company filed a brief five-page motion and notice of joinder in the motions of the GEICO and Non-GEICO Defendants 
(Id., Doc. 123). The motion asks for dismissal of the complaint ""in its entirety and with prejudice"" but does not explain why 
dismissal with prejudice is warranted. Defendant Omni Insurance Company filed a longer motion raising similar arguments to 
those raised in the two principal motions in the Oregon case, but requesting [*423]  dismissal with prejudice and an award of 
attorney's fees under ORS § 20.105. (Id., Doc. 129). This motion also does not explain why dismissal with prejudice is 
warranted. The Eleventh Circuit has emphasized that HN1[
] district courts have very limited discretion to deny leave to amend 
when a plaintiff has had only one chance to plead its claims. Isbrandtsen Marine Services, Inc. v. M/V Inagua Tania, 93 F.3d 
728, 734 (11th Cir. 1996). Absent some explanation why the Oregon Plaintiff should not be allowed to amend its claims against 
Defendants American Commerce and Omni, I cannot recommend dismissing the claims against them with prejudice. I 
recommend that the Court deny Omni's request for attorney's fees without prejudice to Omni re-filing its motion should the Court 
dismiss the claims against it with prejudice. "

1212,12," California appellate courts often describe these claims as being for restitution, not unjust enrichment. For example, in Dunkin 
v. Boskey, 82 Cal. App. 4th 171, 98 Cal. Rptr. 2d 44 (2000), the court explained: ""The phrase 'Unjust Enrichment' does not 
describe a theory of recovery, but an effect: the result of a failure to make restitution under circumstances where it is equitable to 
do so. 84 Cal. App. 4th at 198 n. 18 (citations and quotations omitted). See also Durell v. Sharp Healthcare, 183 Cal. App. 4th 
1350, 1370, 108 Cal. Rptr. 3d 682 (2010) (HN16[
] ""'[T]here is no cause of action in California for unjust enrichment.' Unjust 
enrichment is synonymous with [*449]  restitution."" (quoting Melchior v. New Line Productions, 106 Cal. App. 4th 779, 793, 131 
Cal. Rptr. 2d 347 (2003))). This distinction appears to be one of form, rather than function. See Dunkin, 82 Cal. App. 4th at 198 
n. 18 (""'[I]n any event, ... there is no particular form of pleading necessary to invoke the doctrine' of restitution."" (quoting 
Dinosaur Development, Inc. v. White, 216 Cal.App.3d 1310, 1316, 265 Cal. Rptr. 525 (1989)))."
1212,13," HN17[
] Although the elements of an unjust enrichment claim under Michigan law require that the defendant receive a 
benefit from the plaintiff, Michigan does not require that the benefit be conferred directly by the plaintiff to the defendant. See In 
re Automotive Parts Antitrust Litig., 29 F. Supp. 3d 982, 1021 (E.D. Mich. 2014). "
1213,14," The New Jersey Plaintiffs interpret St. Barnabas to mean that whenever a plaintiff performs a duty owed by a defendant to a 
third party, the defendant is not only enriched, but unjustly enriched at the plaintiff's expense (Case No. 6:14-cv-6013, Doc. 41 at 
4). But, in St. Barnabas, the New Jersey Supreme Court emphasized the fact that the hospital was under [*452]  a duty, 
imposed by state regulation, to treat the indigent inmates. Id. at 38. Here, the New Jersey Plaintiffs were under no duty to repair 
the vehicles belonging to Defendants' insureds and claimants. Additionally, the county in St. Barnabas requested that the 
hospital provide medical care to the inmates; here, by contrast, the New Jersey Plaintiffs have not pled that Defendants or 
Defendants' agents asked them to perform any repairs. "
1214,15," Some case law from the District of New Jersey follows the no-benefit rule [*453]  stated in Adventist and applied by this Court 
in the Florida case. See, e.g., Broad Street Surgical Center, LLC v. Unitedhealth Group, Inc., Civ. No. 11-2775(JBS/JS), 2012 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 30466, 2012 WL 762498, at *8 (D.N.J. Mar. 6, 2012). Whether Broad Street can be reconciled with St. 
Barnabas on this issue is a question best left for a later time."
1214,16," In their memorandum in support of their motion to dismiss in the Kentucky case and their replies in the Alabama, New Jersey, 
and Washington cases, the GEICO Defendants suggest that Plaintiffs can never establish that performance of repairs 
constitutes a benefit to the insurance companies because ""[i]t is common knowledge that insurance companies have a duty to 
pay for the damage to a vehicle, not to repair the vehicle."" (Case No. 6:14-cv-6009, Doc. 27 at 4 n. 2; Case No. 6:14-cv-6013, 
Doc. 43 at 4 n. 3; Case No. 6:14-cv-6015, Doc. 24 at 3 n. 2; Case No. 6:14-cv-6018, Doc. 117 at 12, n. 2). This is hardly 
""common knowledge"" or ""obvious,"" and may not be true. GEICO's standard auto insurance policy for the state of Kentucky for 
example, expressly gives GEICO an option to ""repair or replace the damaged or stolen property"" instead of ""pay[ing] for the 
loss."" (See E.D. Ky. Case No. 5:14-cv-363-DCR-RW, Doc. 1-3 at 12). In any event, the Court cannot consider ""matters outside 
the pleadings"" without converting the [*454]  motion to one for summary judgment, Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(d), and even then, 
unsworn assertions in a brief or memorandum of law are not evidence, Travaglio v. American Express Co., 735 F.3d 1266, 1270 
(11th Cir. 2013). "
1215,17," See, e.g., Allstate Ins. Co. v. Reeves, 440 So.2d 1086, 1089 (Ala. App. 1983); Gould v. American Water Works Service Co., 
52 N.J. 226, 245 A.2d 14, 16 (N.J. 1969); Watkins v. Richmond College Trustees, 41 Mo. 302, 308-09 (1867); see also Lynch v. 
Deaconess Medical Ctr., 113 Wn.2d 162, 776 P.2d 681 (Wash. 1989) (an [*457]  unjust enrichment plaintiff ""cannot be a mere 
volunteer""); Freeman v. Sorchych, 245 P.3d at 936-37 (under Arizona law, plaintiff must show that benefit was not conferred 
officiously); Stein v. Simpson, 37 Cal. 2d 79, 230 P.2d 816, 821 (Cal. 1951) (""A person who officiously confers a benefit upon 
another is not entitled to restitution.""); Plastics & Equipment Sales Co. v. DeSoto, Inc., 91 Ill. App. 3d 1011, 415 N.E.2d 492, 498, 
47 Ill. Dec. 487 (Ill. App. 1st Dist. 1980) (""Quasi-contractual relief is not available, however, where the benefit is conferred 
officiously....""). "
1216,18," Plaintiffs' claims also fail under § 25 of the Restatement (Third) of Restitution and Unjust Enrichment. HN24[
] Section 25 of 
the Restatement provides that a plaintiff will have a restitution claim against a defendant [*460]  who benefits from the plaintiff's 
uncompensated performance of an obligation to a third party only when: (a) liability in restitution will not subject the defendant to 
a forced exchange; (b) absent liability in restitution, the plaintiff will not be compensated for the performance and the defendant 
will retain the benefit of it without paying for it; and (c) restitution will not subject the defendant to an obligation from which the 
parties understood the defendant would be free. Comment b to this section explains that the second requirement will not be 
satisfied where the plaintiff sues the defendant for restitution ""instead of pursuing a viable contract claim"" against the other party 
to the plaintiff's contract. Nowhere in any of these complaints do Plaintiffs allege that they cannot recover the contract price for 
the repairs from Defendants' insureds and claimants. "
1218,19," The tortious interference counts are: Count III in Case No. 6:14-cv-6006; Count V in Case No. 6:14-cv-6007; Count V in Case

and Count III in Case No. 6:15-cv-6022. The titles vary, with some complaints specifying the interference as being with 
""Business Relations"" and others with ""Prospective Economic Advantage,"" but the substance of each claim is the same. "
1219,20," The factors are: (a) the nature of the actor's conduct, (b) the actor's motive, (c) the interests of the other with [*471]  which the 
actor's conduct interferes, (d) the interests sought to be advanced by the actor, (e) the social interests in protecting the freedom 
of action of the actor and the contractual interests of the other, (f) the proximity or remoteness of the actor's conduct to the 
interference, and (g) the relations between the parties. Id. "
1220,21," Alabama also recognizes an affirmative defense of justification in tortious interference cases, and a competitor's privilege to 
interfere. White Sands, 32 So.3d at 12; Tom's Foods, 896 So.2d at 457-58. However, the privilege does not allow the use of 
improper means. Tom's Foods 896 So.2d at 458. "
1221,22," Plaintiff cites AWP, Inc. v. Commonwealth Excavating, Inc., No. 5:13cv031, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 103881, 2013 WL 
3830500, at *8 (W.D. Va. 2013), in support of its argument that it can plead a tortious interference claim by alleging nothing more 
than interference with its customer base generally. In AWP, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant poached four ""specific 
customers"" with whom the plaintiff expected to reach an agreement. All Plaintiffs have offered in these cases are general 
allegations that Defendants interfered with a broadly defined class of potential customers. Indeed, the facts of this case are 
much closer to those in the case the AWP court distinguished. Like the plaintiff in Gov't Employees Ins. Co. v. Google, 330 F. 
Supp. 2d 700 (E.D. Va. 2004), the Virginia Plaintiffs' tortious interference claim is ""founded upon mere speculation that some 
unidentified potential ... customers"" might take their business elsewhere. AWP, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 103881, 2013 WL

to the doctrine of ""quasi-estoppel"" in the body of the complaint (Doc. 1, ¶ 137) and calls the claim one for ""quasi-estoppel"" in its 
response to the motions to dismiss and does not attempt to rebut Defendants' arguments that ""equitable estoppel"" is not a cause

""to pay thousands of dollars in out-of- pocket educational related expenses,"" and can lose the scholarship for any reason. (Id. ¶ 
116). They also assert that ""[t]he room and board provisions in full scholarship leave 85% of players living on campus and 86% 
of players living off campus living below the federal poverty line."" (Id. ¶ 118). "
1240,6," Many of the arguments overlap. For ease of reference, the Court will at times simply refer to the arguments collectively, as if 
raised by all of the Defendants. "
1241,7," The Court in State ex rel. Presley also stated that nothing in the TPRPA ""should be construed to limit vested rights of publicity 
that were in existence prior to the effective date of the act"" because ""[t]o do so would be contrary to Article I, Section 20 of the 
Tennessee Constitution."" Id. However, it is likely that, when the statute was enacted, none of the Plaintiffs were yet born, and 
most certainly not college athletes, since all Plaintiffs are alleged to have played either college football or college basketball 
between the 2008 and 2013 seasons. "
1242,8," That same court, after a bench trial, found that certain ""NCAA rules unreasonably restrain trade in the market for certain 
educational and athletic opportunities offered by NCAA Division I schools,"" and that ""[t]he procompetitive justifications that the 
NCAA offers do not justify this restraint and could be achieved through less restrictive means."" O'Bannon v. NCAA, 7 F. Supp. 
3d 955, 963 (N.D. Cal. 2014). Again, the NCAA is not a Defendant in this action."
1242,9," The Court notes that while this opinion was in its final draft, the Eighth Circuit addressed the approval of a settlement for 
players who remained a part of the class action in Dryer. In so doing, the court noted that ""[t]he district court carefully and 
thoughtfully considered the strength of the plaintiffs' case and all of the potential [**24]  risks they would face by continuing to

three plaintiffs ""who opted out of the settlement and proceeded to the merits of their claims had their claims entirely dismissed by "
1243,," the district court,"" and that ""the district court rejected every single one of the plaintiffs' claims under every state law and under 
every single theory and defense."" Id. While the merits of the claims were not before the Eighth Circuit, that court observed the

1249,11," Plaintiffs argue that the Conference Defendants are mistaken when they assert that the absence of an enforceable right of

anticompetitive effects of which are palpable in every state in the country."" (Docket No. 258 at 6). That may be so, but the only 
right of publicity pled is under Tennessee law. It is not this Court's duty to scour or canvass the law of every jurisdiction in order

raises a dispute of fact more appropriate for resolution by a jury. Therefore, the Court will not dismiss Plaintiffs' claims on this 
basis. "
1290,1," News Corp. relies on the reasoning in Allied Orthopedic Appliances, Inc. v. Tyco Healthcare Group L.P, to support its argument 
that Plaintiffs have not shown common proof of antitrust impact. 247 F.R.D. 156 (C.D. Cal. 2007). Unlike Dr. MacKie-Mason, the 
experts in Allied made no statistical showing that the prices paid by the putative class members were determinable by common 
factors."
1290,2," The other three theories of injury were that Comcast's clustering: (1) permitted it to withhold local sports programming from 
satellite competitors, thereby reducing competitor market penetration; (2) ""reduced the level of 'benchmark' competition on which 
cable customers rely to compare [provider] prices""; and (3) ""increased Comcast's bargaining power relative to content 
providers."" Comcast, 133 S. Ct. at 1430-31. "
1291,3," Aside from News Corp.'s contracts with retailers and CPGs, Plaintiffs also allege that News Corp. engages in additional anti-
competitive conduct by hacking into computerized customer lists and marketing materials of its competitor, FLOORgraphics; 
staggering the terms of exclusive contracts; enforcing shelf exclusivity; using cash guarantees to derail competitor contracts; 
disparaging competitors' compliance rates; defacing competitor advertisements; and disparaging competitor financial viability.

1306,2," The District of Columbia Circuit persuasively explained the reasons for limiting standing pursuant to section 303: ""The practical 
reasons justifying the view that section 303 imposes significant standing requirements are quite simple. Absent such 
requirements, 'unlimited liability under § 303 might produce financial disaster for unions and inhibit the exercise of the right to 
strike.' In light of these considerations, it has been clear to the courts that 'the imposition of unlimited liability under section 303 
would tend to subvert our national labor policy.'"" Charvet v. Int'l Longshoremen's Ass'n, AFL-CIO, 736 F.2d 1572, 1575, 237 U.S.

1308,4," The Ninth Circuit has summarized the AGC factors in various ways, but the analysis remains the same in each case. See, e.g.,

Court respectfully declines to follow this holding in light of the Ninth Circuit's holding in Eagle."
1309,6," Were Plaintiffs to define the relevant market as, for example, that of labor union [**20]  membership dues, the result may be 
different, as the Union Plaintiffs' only alleged injury is a reduction of such dues as a result of their members terminating their 
membership and joining Defendants' unions. (See, e.g., SAC ¶ 159(c).) It is thus plausible to conclude that the Union Plaintiffs 
are competing with Defendants for union membership dues, but it is not reasonable to conclude that they compete in the 
relevant market as defined in the SAC. "
1311,7," The Court finds Plaintiffs' reliance on Ostrofe v. H.S. Crocker Co., 740 F.2d 739, 746 (9th Cir. 1984) [hereinafter Ostrofe II], to 
be inapposite. Since its holding in Ostrofe II, the Ninth Circuit has made clear that HN18[
] ""[t]he exception recognized in 
Ostrofe II is limited to those cases in which a dismissed employee is an 'essential participant' in an antitrust scheme, the 
dismissal is a 'necessary means' to accomplish the scheme, and the employee has the greatest incentive to challenge the 
antitrust violation."" Vinci, 80 F.3d at 1376."
1311,8," Plaintiffs claim that there are actually five elements to this test ""when these cases are considered in context,"" but they do not 
adequately explain what the additional elements should be. (See Opp'n at 20.) Moreover, the Court has already rejected 
Plaintiffs' [**29]  attempt to impose the additional requirement that ""the provisions in question must address the labor relationship 
between an employer and its employees,"" (Opp'n at 20). (See Dkt. No. 46 at 15.) And as the Court explained in its prior order, 
the three-part test from Mackey was designed to be applicable to different types of cases. See Phoenix Elec. Co., 81 F.3d at 
861; Mackey, 543 F.2d at 613-14 (""Although the cases giving rise to the nonstatutory exemption are factually dissimilar from the

International Organizations (""AFL-CIO"") Constitution in its first order granting Defendants' motion to dismiss. (Dkt. No. 40.)"
1312,10," While the factual findings of the court in ICTSI are not binding on this case, the Court notes that the court interpreted the 
PCLCD as primarily affecting only the ILWU and PMA—the parties to the agreement. See ICTSI, 15 F. Supp. 3d at 1093 (""The 
requirement that ILWU workers be assigned the work, however, is only binding on PMA members, who are parties to the 
collective bargaining agreement.""); id. at 1093 n.8 (""Here, the alleged agreement is [**31]  the PCLCD, and it does not impose

1322,1," Petitioner Robert Grabb later acquired an interest in the patent. For simplicity, we [****7]  refer only to Kimble. "
1323,2," In Brulotte, the patent holder retained ownership of the patent while licensing customers to use the patented article in exchange 
for royalty payments. See 379 U.S., at 29-30, 85 S. Ct. 176, 13 L. Ed. 2d 99. By contrast, Kimble sold his whole patent to obtain 
royalties. But no one here disputes that Brulotte covers a transaction structured in that alternative way."
1323,3," See, e.g., Scheiber v. Dolby Labs., Inc., 293 F. 3d 1014, 1017-1018 (CA7 2002) (Posner, J.) (Brulotte has been “severely, and 
as it seems to us, with all due respect, justly criticized . . . . However, we have no authority to overrule a Supreme Court decision 
no matter how dubious its reasoning strikes us, or even how out of touch with the Supreme Court’s current thinking the decision 
seems”); Ayres & Klemperer, Limiting Patentees’ Market Power Without Reducing Innovation Incentives: The Perverse [****9]  
Benefits of Uncertainty and Non-Injunctive Remedies, 97 Mich. L. Rev. 985, 1027 (1999) (“Our analysis . . . suggests that 
Brulotte should be overruled”). "
1326,4," The only legal erosion to which Kimble gestures is a change in the treatment of patent tying agreements—i.e., contracts 
conditioning a licensee’s right to use a patent on the purchase of an unpatented product. See Brief for Petitioners 43. When 
Brulotte was decided, those agreements counted as per se antitrust violations and patent misuse; now, they are unlawful only if 
the patent holder wields power in the relevant market. See Act of Nov. 19, 1988, §201, 102 Stat. 4676 (adding the 
market [****21]  power requirement in the patent-misuse context); Illinois Tool Works Inc. v. Independent Ink, Inc., 547 U.S. 28, 
41-43, 126 S. Ct. 1281, 164 L. Ed. 2d 26 (2006) (relying on that legislative change to overrule antitrust decisions about tying and 
to adopt the same standard). But it is far from clear that the old rule of tying was among Brulotte’s legal underpinnings. Brulotte 
briefly analogized post-expiration royalty agreements to tying arrangements, but only after relating the statutory and caselaw 
basis for its holding and “conclud[ing]” that post-patent royalties are “unlawful per se.” 379 U.S., at 32, 85 S. Ct. 176, 13 L. Ed. 
2d 99. And even if that analogy played some real role in Brulotte, the development of tying law would not undercut the 
decision—rather the opposite. Congress took the lead in changing the treatment of tying agreements and, in doing so, 
conspicuously left Brulotte in place. Indeed, Congress declined to enact bills that would have modified not only tying doctrine but 
also Brulotte. See supra, at ___, 192 L. Ed. 2d, at 472 (citing S. 1200, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. (1987), and S. 438, 100th Cong., 
2d Sess. (1988)). That choice suggests congressional acquiescence in Brulotte, and so further supports adhering to stare 
decisis. "

1339,7," In deciding the pending motion to dismiss, the Court ""may take judicial notice of public records [or documents] of the FDA"" 
relating to the aripiprazole products at issue in this litigation. Kaiser v. Depuy Spine, Inc., 944 F. Supp. 2d 1187, 1192 n.2 (M.D.

(same)."
1339,8," For that reason, the Court rejects Otsuka's reliance upon Ethypharm S.A. France. Indeed, in Ethypharm S.A. France, the Court 
of Appeals for the Third Circuit found the plaintiff could not ""be considered a competitor for purposes of antitrust [**18]  injury,"" 
because ""legal barriers particular to the pharmaceutical market"" precluded the plaintiff's from marketing a competing product. 
707 F.3d at 236. Here, however, the legal barriers that once plagued Torrent's ability to enter the aripiprazole market, namely, 
expiration of the '528 Patent and final FDA approval, no longer present any impediment. Therefore, in the absence of this 
litigation, Torrent could immediately become, without reticence, Otsuka's lawful competitor."
1339,9," Nor are direct factual allegations of Torrent's chances of litigation success required; ""inferential allegations"" can suffice. See In 
re Niaspan Antitrust Litig., 42 F. Supp. 3d at 757 n.18 (citations omitted) "
1340,10," Torrent's submission of Paragraph IV certification under 21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(2)(A)(vii) compels no different result. Indeed, in its 
Paragraph IV certification, Torrent specifically certified that the Torrent aripiprazole tablets would ""not infringe any valid claim of 
the '615 and '796 patents."" (Countercl. at ¶ 15.) In that respect, even though Torrent's certification provided the technical act of 
constructive infringement necessary to initiate an action under 35 U.S.C. § 271(e)(2)(A), nothing in a paragraph IV certification "
1341,," necessarily compels the institution of an infringement suit. Indeed, it is commonplace for NDA owners not to file suit after 
analyzing the contents [**23]  of an ANDA filer's notice and certification, and the case law cited by Otsuka provides little support 
for its position that the filing of a paragraph IV certification renders this litigation per se reasonable. Critically, in Celgene, the 
Court considered the factual and legal basis of the litigation in the context of a request for sanctions under Federal Rule of Civil 
Procedure 11, not in connection with a Noerr-Pennington analysis. See 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 55700, 2008 WL 2856469, at *3. 
In AstraZeneca AB v. Mylan Labs., Inc., 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 50049, 2010 WL 2079722, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. May 19, 2010), a case 
that relied upon Celgene, then addressed the defendant's antitrust counterclaims and Noerr-Pennington immunity, following ""a 
42-day bench trial"" on the allegations of the plaintiff's claims and based, at least in part, upon the public records associated with 
that lengthy bench trial. 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 50049, [WL] at *4. No such record has been developed in this instance."
1341,11," The Court will, as stated below, bifurcate and stay Torrent's antitrust Counterclaim, pending resolution of the patent 
infringement issues. "
1342,12," Torrent attempts to sidestep this elemental requirement, but provides no support for its position that a claim of patent misuse 
can survive without an allegation of an impermissibly broadened patent. Nor does Torrent's sole citation to Altana Pharma AG v. 
Teva Pharms. USA, Inc., No. 04-2355, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 79166, 2012 WL 2068611 (D.N.J. June 7, 2012), compel any 
contrary result. Indeed, in Altana, the defendants specifically alleged that the plaintiff engaged in patent misuse by amending 
certain license agreements to treat the disputed patent as if it remained ""in force for an additional six months past the expiration 
date."" 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 79166, [WL] at *2. Torrent has proffered no similar allegation in this instance. "

1372,3," There was little evidence presented about the delivery capabilities of specialty distributors, aside from the fact that they have a 
limited geographic range of delivery. See PX00427-002 (Sodexo declarant indicating that specialty distributors covered a limited

1374,4," In neither their opposition to the FTC's motion for preliminary injunction nor their proposed findings of fact and conclusions of 
law do Defendants attempt to distinguish Whole Foods or Staples. At oral argument, Defendants distinguished Staples based on 
the fact that in Staples the FTC had pricing data to show that prices were lower in markets where both merging firms were 
present. Closing Arg. Hr'g Tr. at 38-40. Defendants also sought to distinguish Whole Foods on the facts, arguing that in Whole 
Foods the defendants could not show that in the event of a price increase consumers of PNOS could go to a standard grocery 
store. Id. at 40-41. But the court finds these efforts [**55]  to distinguish Staples and Whole Foods unconvincing. It is true that 
there was stronger pricing data in Staples, but pricing data alone did not lead to the court's conclusion. The factual similarities 
between this case and Staples, particularly the Brown Shoe practical indicia, are otherwise strong. As for Whole Foods, it is 
even more factually analogous to this case than is Staples. If anything, the proof that other channels of distribution are not 
reasonable substitutes for broadline is more compelling in this case than the evidence in Whole Foods that ordinary grocery 
stores are not a reasonable substitute for PNOS. "

1378,17," In finding Dr. Israel's conclusion more persuasive than that advanced by Defendants' expert, the court might be doing more 
than it is required to do. As Judge Tatel stated in Whole Foods: HN21[

However, Brown Shoe only listed ""distinct customers"" as one of many factors for courts to consider in defining a market. Brown 
Shoe, 370 U.S. at 325. It did not endorse defining a market around a group of targeted customers."
1380,20," The Merger Guidelines do not, for instance, set forth how a court is to distinguish a ""targeted"" group of customers from 
customers in general. This gives rise to the question of what limiting principles or factors a court should apply in defining a price 
discrimination market. Absent limitations, price discrimination against a single customer might be used to justify blocking a 
merger. This is not a mere theoretical possibility. According to the Merger Guidelines, ""Off prices are negotiated individually with 
customers, the hypothetical monopolist test may suggest relevant markets that are as narrow as individual customers."" Merger

1463,4," One significant point warrants discussion at the outset. Hellmann GmbH and Hellmann HK have correctly pointed out that the 
Second R&R (as well as the First R&R, for that matter) considered motions that were served before they were named as 
defendants in this case. To be sure, it might be procedurally improper if the court were to rely on a law-of-the-case theory to 
address their arguments for dismissal. See, e.g., In re Manhattan Inv. Fund Ltd., 310 B.R. 500, 513 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 2002) 
(""The District Court's ruling in that class action is not binding upon the Trustee because she was not a party to that action."") "
1464,," (citing Ackerman v. Schultz, 250 B.R. 22, 27-28 (Bankr. E.D.N.Y. 2000)); Bricklayers & Allied Craftsmen, Local Union No. 44 v. 
Corbetta Constr. Co., 511 F. Supp. 1386, 1390 (S.D.N.Y. 1981) (""[A]pplication of the [law of the case] doctrine would be 
particularly inappropriate [in part because] Laborers was not a party to the prior proceeding.""). However, although the present 
opinion invokes—and discusses in considerable detail—the analyses contained in the prior R&Rs, I do not consider those 
opinions as binding against the newly-named Hellmann GmbH and Hellmann HK. Rather, I refer to the prior R&Rs to obviate the 
need to begin the instant analysis at square one. Hellmann GmbH's and Hellmann HK's absence from the prior proceedings 
does not bar the court from doing so. And to the extent Hellmann GmbH and Hellmann HK contend they were not afforded the 
opportunity to formally object to prior R&Rs, they have had ample opportunity in their submissions on this motion to take issue 
with the court's previous rulings."
1464,5," Except where otherwise indicated, the court hereinafter refers to Hellmann GmbH and Hellmann HK collectively as ""Hellmann."" "
1466,6," Specifically, the last overt acts to be alleged in connection with each claim asserted against Hellmann occurred as follows: 
Third Claim: November 2004, see CTAC at ¶ 346; Fifth Claim: March 2006, id. at ¶¶ 439-40; Sixth Claim: January 2008, id. at ¶ 
450; Eighth Claim: February 2005, id. at ¶ 525; [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] he First Claim, which alleges a final overt 
act in October 2001. Id. at ¶ 314. "
1467,7," The court acknowledges that it wrote in the First R&R that ""[t]aking the allegations at face value, the plaintiffs continued to buy 
freight forwarding services from the defendants throughout the entire [class] period,"" which extended until the filing of the 
FACAC on July 21, 2009. See First R&R at pp. 3, 94. This does not dictate, however, that the conspiracies at issue lasted until 
that date. "
1468,8," Hellmann similarly states that since the plaintiffs ""failed to plead facts sufficient to allege conspiratorial conduct on behalf of the 
Hellmann Defendants, Plaintiffs have failed to plead facts supportive of the first element of fraudulent concealment as to the 
Hellmann Defendants."" Defendants Hellmann Worldwide Logistics GmbH & Co. KG and Hellmann Worldwide Logistics Limited 
Hong Kong's Memorandum in Support of their Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs' Corrected Third Amended Class Action Complaint 
(""Motion to Dismiss"") at p. 23. "
1470,9," Rule 15(c)(1)(B) requires that ""the amendment asserts a claim or defense that arose out of the conduct, transaction, or 
occurrence set out—or attempted to be set out—in the original pleading."""
1470,10, The relevant time period is 120 days after the complaint is filed. Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(m). 
1472,11," The court agrees that the Advisory Committee Notes betray a concern for situations involving changing, rather than adding, 
parties. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 15 advisory committee's note (""In actions between private parties, the problem of relation back of 
amendments changing defendants has generally been better handled by the courts, but incorrect criteria have sometimes been 
applied, leading sporadically to doubtful results. Rule 15(c) has been amplified to provide a general solution."") (emphasis added) 
(internal citation omitted). The Advisory Committee's statement that ""a complaint may be amended at any time to correct a 
formal defect such as a misnomer or misidentification"" further suggests a narrow, substitution-centric reading of Rule 15. See id. 
(emphasis added). "
1473,12," Plaintiffs also cite as support VKK Corp. v. National Football League, 244 F.3d 114 (2d Cir. 2001), in which the Second Circuit 
allowed the addition of a defendant to relate back to the timely-filed complaint. See id. at 128-29. However, VVK Corp. well 
predates Krupski, and as such, carries limited weight. "
1474,13," In view of this conclusion, it is unnecessary to address the question of whether the relation back requirements set forth in Fed. 
R. Civ. P. 15(c)(1)(B) and Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c)(1)(C)(I) have been satisfied. "
1475,14," For instance, the CTAC alleged that the Panalpina ""parent corporation treats its subsidiaries as mere divisions of the company 
rather than separate entities"" and that it exerts ""substantial control over its subsidiaries such that it is a single enterprise."" See 
CTAC at ¶¶ 140-41. "
1477,15," In addition, since the issuance of the Second R&R, both CRT and Flat Panel have been met with approval. The court in In re 
Lithium Ion Batteries Antitrust Litig., No. 13-MD-2420 (YGR), 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 141358, 2014 WL 4955377 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 
2, 2014), for example, relied upon these decisions in denying a motion to dismiss premised upon an improper corporate 
grouping argument. Citing both cases as support, the Lithium court wrote that ""[t]he mere failure to observe fine distinctions 
among corporate entities . . . does not . . . render implausible the suggestion of collusion."" 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 141358, [WL] 
at *32. It concluded that ""[a]lthough Plaintiffs will need to provide evidence of each Defendants' participation in any conspiracy, they now [i.e. at the 
motion to dismiss stage] only need to make allegations that plausibly suggest that each Defendant participated in the 
alleged conspiracy."" . . . The inference . . . that generic references to NEC . . . implicate both NEC Corp. and NEC Tokin—is 
plausible, and the competing inference, that in informal communication defendants' employees carefully delineated 
between similarly branded corporate entities . . . is not."
1477,2014," U.S. Dist. LEXIS 141358, [WL] at *34 (quoting In re Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) Antitrust Litig., 580 F. Supp. 
2d 896, 904 (N.D. Cal. 2008))."
1477,16," Hellmann also argues that the CTAC does not support a plausible inference of liability on either corporate veil-piercing or 
agency theories. See generally Motion to Dismiss at pp. 8-12. As stated in the Second R&R, however, [i]n antitrust cases, courts analyze [*61]  allegations that group together corporate families under various standards — they 
look to the standards for agency, for piercing of the corporate veil, or to whether the allegations sufficiently allege that each 
corporate affiliate individually joined the conspiracy. There is not a clear distinction in the cases between these standards 
— rather, it depends primarily on the type of case, type of industry, and nature of the antitrust violation. Second R&R at p. 23. Accordingly, the paramount inquiry is ""whether, based on the allegations, one can plausibly infer that each defendant knowingly 
joined and played some role in the conspiracy."" See id. Having answered this question in the affirmative based on the foregoing 
corporate grouping analysis, the court need not separately address the related doctrines of veil-piercing and agency. See id. at 
p. 24 n.12 (declining to conduct veil-piercing analysis, but noting that ""the allegations in the TAC are sufficient to allege that 
some of the parent defendants here controlled their subsidiaries as to the transactions at issue."") (citing American Fuel Corp. v. 
Utah Energy Development Co., Inc., 122 F.3d 130, 134 (2d Cir. 1997)). "
1478,17," Hellmann here also rehashes its improper corporate grouping argument, asserting that the NES claim fails because it makes 
the Hellmann entities ""a 'corporate family' unit without alleging a basis for doing so,"" and accordingly ""fail[s] to allege sufficient 
facts to support a claim of conspiracy"" against any of the individual Hellmann entities. See Motion to Dismiss at p. 12. In the 
Second R&R, the court considered the DSV Defendants' similar argument for dismissal which asserted that the plaintiffs ""do not 
allege which corporate entity employed [a DSV representative] nor do plaintiffs allege he was acting for either DSV A/S or DSV 
Solutions."" See Dkt. No. 779 at pp. 6-7. Although, as we do here, the Second R&R found this argument to fail ""[f]or the reasons 
discussed in the grouping section above,"" the court's elucidation for its DSV-specific finding—namely, that the plaintiffs 
adequately alleged that the DSV parent and a DSV subsidiary ""are responsible for the conduct of [a second DSV subsidiary] or 
independently joined the agreements,"" see Second R&R at pp. 53-54—further supports the court's identical holding here. To wit, 
the court noted that ""[t]he TAC alleges that DSV A/S . . . is the parent company of both DSV Solutions and DFDS."" Id. at p. 54 
(citing TAC ¶¶ 59-61). This, coupled with ""the allegations of corporate control, the nature of the freight forwarding industry, and 
the allegations that the participation of corporate affiliates was necessary to the conspiracies"" sufficed to ""make[ ] it plausible that 
these defendants acted in concert and individually joined the conspiracies."" See id. Here too, the CTAC alleges that Hellmann 
Inc. and Hellmann HK are subsidiaries of Hellmann GmbH, see CTAC ¶ 69, and, as noted above, the discussions of corporate "
1479,," control, the nature of the freight forwarding industry, and the necessity of the full participation of corporate affiliates apply with 
equal force to Hellmann as they did to DSV. So too, therefore, does the conclusion that these entities plausibly ""acted in concert 
and individually joined the conspiracies."" "
1480,18," The court reached a similar conclusion regarding defendant Geodis' motion to dismiss. See Second R&R at pp. 57-58 
(""Although the plaintiffs may have barely alleged Geodis' participation in this conspiracy by only alleging that it imposed the 
collusive surcharges,"" in light of details as to formation and execution of AMS Conspiracy, plaintiffs' allegations were ""enough at 
this stage to assert a claim against Geodis."") (citing Dkt. No. 628 at p. 3 and n.4)."
1480,19," Although, as noted above, the CAF allegations lodged against Hellmann are not particularly robust, it bears restating that they 
consist of more than a mere reference to Hellmann as one of the CAF Defendants. Thus, the allegation that Hellmann was 
contacted by a co-defendant in connection with the CAF Conspiracy—coupled with the factors described above—further 
supports tying Hellmann to the CAF Conspiracy. See Second R&R at p. 61 (connecting defendants Kintetsu and Nippon to Peak 
Season Surcharge Conspiracy on the strength of similar allegations). Nor is the court's conclusion undermined by the fact that the CTAC fails to establish that a Hellmann representative participated 
in the CAF meetings and conference call, since the CTAC makes clear that the lists of defendants involved in these proceedings 
is not exhaustive. See CTAC at ¶ 388 (meeting attended by ""representatives of at least"" defendants named therein) (emphasis 
added); id. at ¶¶ 424, 426, 429 (same); id. at ¶ 419 (listing, ""among others,"" attendees at August 12, 2005 meeting); see also 
Second R&R at p. 55 (failure to name specific defendant as attending conspiratorial meeting not fatal because defendant was 
alleged to have imposed surcharge, and list of meeting attendees not exhaustive); First R&R at pp. 48-49 (same); First R&R at 
pp. 45-46 (allegation that participants in meetings and conference call included ""at least"" specified defendants indicates that 
others may have been present). "
1481,20," Plaintiffs impliedly made this allegation by writing that the Ocean AMS Defendants—a group which Geodis (and Hellmann, for 
that matter) is alleged to have belonged—imposed the Ocean AMS surcharge. See CTAC at p. 148 and ¶ 558. "
1483,21," Because the CTAC alleges that Dachser and UPS, like Hellmann, joined the global conspiracy, but makes no similar reference 
to BAX and Geodis, see CTAC at ¶ 571, the court's analysis will center on Dachser and UPS, rather than BAX and Geodis, 
since the allegations against the latter are facially distinguishable from those against Hellmann."
1483,22," It bears mention that the court's finding that the CTAC plausibly alleges the Global Conspiracy as against Hellmann lends 
credence to the plausibility of the component conspiracies as alleged against Hellmann. "
1489,1," In Arrowhead, the court made clear that ""[w]hen the defendant's conduct, including its statements, falls [*15]  short of an 
express charge [of infringement], one must consider the 'totality of the circumstances' in determining whether that conduct meets

1491,2," The Court notes the scholarship of Professor Christopher R. Leslie who has advocated for the abolishment of the 
""enforcement"" requirement altogether. In a law review article directly on point to the issue before the Court, Professor Leslie has 
challenged the notion that mere procurement of a patent, no matter the conduct of the patentee in obtaining the patent, cannot—
without more—affect the welfare of the consumer [*21]  and in itself violate the antitrust laws. See Christopher R. Leslie, The 
Anticompetitive Effects of Unenforced Invalid Patents, 91 Minn. L. Rev. 101 (2006). Instead, Professor Leslie contends ""mere 
procurement and possession of an invalid patent can, in fact, injure competition and reduce consumer welfare."" Id. at 113. 
Professor Leslie persuasively documents the variety of ways simple possession of an invalid patent can help maintain an 
illegitimate monopoly, including (1) how the ""[t]he fear of infringement can deter entry into the monopolist's market, even if the 
potential competitor strongly believes that the patent at issue is invalid""; (2) the ""increase[d] entry costs by compelling rivals to 
research the patent's validity, to attempt to design around the patent, or to pay (unnecessary) licensing fees""; (3) how ""a 
monopolist's suspect patents can deter its competitor's customers, business partners, and venture capitalists from doing 
business with them""; and (4) how ""firms may avoid entire fields of research out of fear of infringement litigation, a phenomenon 
that can distort innovation and reduce long term competition even further."" Id. at 104, 114-39. Many of these factors are present 
in Xitronix's allegations, and Professor Leslie's [*22]  research supports Xitronix's claims of antitrust injury despite the fact KLA 
has not overtly enforced the '260 Patent. While Professor Leslie argued for elimination of the ""enforcement"" requirement in his article, which, notably, he wrote prior to 
MedImmune and the adoption of an even more adaptable standard for Declaratory Judgment jurisdiction, such a decision is 
beyond this Court's limited function. Interestingly, however, in subsequent papers, Professor Leslie has noted how MedImmune 
""has important implications for antitrust law"" and that it has the potential to move courts away from rigid applications of the 
""enforcement"" requirement. See Christopher R. Leslie, New Possibilities for Asserting Walker Process Claims, 21-SUM

competitors gave it something of value (dropping their legal claims).""); id. at 2245 (""[The majority's] logic . . . cannot possibly be

1510,29," The defendants' arguments are much like those rejected by the majority in Actavis. The disagreement in the Court was 
fundamental. In the dissenters' view, ""a patent claim cannot possibly impose unlawful anticompetitive harm if the patent holder is 
acting within the scope of a valid patent and therefore permitted to do precisely what the antitrust suit claims is unlawful."" 133 S. 
Ct. at 2244 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting) (emphasis in original). The dissenters viewed the majority as ""impos[ing] antitrust liability 
based on the parties' subjective uncertainty about [a] legal conclusion,"" namely, whether a patent is valid (and it is one or the 
other), because ""[t]he majority seems to think that even if the patent is valid, a patent holder violates the antitrust laws merely 
because the settlement took away some chance that his patent would be declared invalid by a court."" Id. (emphasis in original). 
In fact, the dissenters perceived a slippery slope in that the majority's ""logic—that taking away any chance that a patent will be 
invalidated is itself an antitrust problem—cannot possibly be limited to reverse-payment agreements, or those that are 'large.'"" Id. 
at 2245 (emphasis in original) (quoting id. at 2236 (majority [**45]  opinion))."
1510,30," See Actavis, 133 S. Ct. at 2237; cf. K-Dur, 686 F.3d at 217-18 (""[N]othing in the rule of reason test that we adopt here limits 
the ability of the parties to reach settlements based on a negotiated entry date for marketing of the generic drug . . . .""). "
1511,31," The Court was unpersuaded by the dissenters' arguments in this vein. The dissenters contended there was no empirical 
evidence that most reverse payment settlements occur in the Hatch-Waxman context, and that payments from patentee to 
alleged infringer ""are a well-known feature of intellectual property litigation, and reflect [**48]  an intuitive way to settle such 
disputes."" Actavis, 133 S. Ct. at 2242-43 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting). The Court, however, thought that ""[a]pparently most if not 
all reverse payment settlement agreements arise in the context of pharmaceutical drug regulation, and specifically in the context 
of suits brought under statutory provisions allowing a generic drug manufacturer (seeking speedy marketing approval) to 
challenge the validity of a patent owned by an already approved brand-name drug owner."" Id. at 2227 (majority opinion). 
Similarly, although the dissenters contended that ""[w]hile the alleged infringer may not be suing for the patent holder's money, it 
is suing for the right to use and market the (intellectual) property, which is worth money,"" id. at 2243 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting) 
(emphasis in original), the Court thought reverse payments ""unusual,"" id. at 2231 (majority opinion). The dissenters also thought 
that the Court's holding would discourage settlement even though ""the right to settle generally accompanies the right to litigate in 
the first place."" Id. at 2243 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting). They postulated that ""the majority's decision may very well discourage 
generics from challenging pharmaceutical patents in the first place"" by ""[t]aking the prospect of settlements [**49]  off the table—
or limiting settlements to an earlier entry date for the generic, which may still be many years in the future."" Id. at 2247."
1511,32," In addition, Trinko dealt with different questions regarding unlawful monopolization and the refusal to deal—set against the 
background of ""the long recognized right of [a] trader or manufacturer engaged in an entirely private business, freely to exercise 
his own independent discretion as to parties with whom he will deal,"" 540 U.S. at 408 (alteration in original) (quoting United

basic question—that of the presence of significant unjustified anticompetitive consequences. Actavis, 133 S. Ct. at 2238. In addition, nothing in this opinion precludes a defendant from prevailing on a motion to dismiss or

1555,5," But see Wrobel, No. 05-cv-1296, 2006 WL 7130617, available at [574-1, at 9] (allowing indirect plaintiff's unjust enrichment 
claim to survive a motion to dismiss based on the fact that ""Kansas specifically allows indirect-purchaser claims,"" but 
nonetheless noting that ""there may be some limits that would apply,"" but that the court ""d[id] not know, on the present pleadings, "
1556,," how far removed from direct-purchaser status Plaintiff may be""). Here, six years into this MDL litigation, the Court has a much 
better grasp on the extent of the remoteness between Indirect Plaintiffs and Defendants, and thus finds dismissal appropriate at 
the motion-to-dismiss phase."
1556,6," To avoid confusion, the Court notes that dismissal of Indirect Plaintiffs' unjust enrichment claims under Arkansas and 
Minnesota law is appropriate on other grounds, as discussed below."
1556,7," Indirect Plaintiffs' claims under Arkansas law as raised in the Rogers complaint were timely filed because Arkansas law 
provides a five-year statute of limitations. See Ark. Code Ann. § 4-88-115. Indirect Plaintiffs' claims under New York, Michigan, 
and Kansas law—as raised in the Rudman, Waun, and Asmann lawsuits—are not time barred because those named Plaintiffs 
had standing to raise those claims when their respective suits were filed, which in each case was within the relevant limitations 
period. "
1557,8," The rationale behind Indirect Plaintiffs' selection of these particular claims is based on their allegation that these claims are 
governed by ""general state statutes of limitations,"" and Vermont's so-called ""general statute of limitations"" is six years. Vt. Stat. 
Ann. tit. 12, § 511. Assumedly Vermont would apply a shorter statute of limitations to Indirect Plaintiffs' other claims. "
1565,9," The Illinois Supreme Court laid the foundation for why states should not adopt cross-jurisdictional tolling, reasoning that 
""[u]nless all states simultaneously adopt the rule of cross-jurisdictional class action tolling, any state which independently does 
so will invite into its courts a disproportionate share of suits which the federal courts have refused to certify as class actions after 
the statute of limitations has run."" Portwood v. Ford Motor Co., 183 Ill. 2d 459, 701 N.E.2d 1102, 1103-05, 233 Ill. Dec. 828 
(1998) (""[B]ecause state courts have no control over the work of the federal judiciary, we believe it would be unwise to adopt a 
policy basing the length of Illinois limitation periods on the federal courts' disposition of suits seeking class certification.""). But 
see In re Linerboard Antitrust Litig., 223 F.R.D. at 346 (""[D]eclining to adopt cross-jurisdictional class action tolling will invite the 
filing of numerous protective, duplicative and in many cases, unnecessary, suits by class members that want to consider [*102]  
filing claims under state antitrust law not included in a federal class action complaint."")."
1565,10," The reason that such an allegation would only potentially save Indirect Plaintiffs' claims is because the claim is still dependent 
on the assumption that the entire class of indirect plaintiffs purchased finished dairy products made exclusively out of the cheese 
that Defendants purchased on the CME cheese spot market. "
1566,11," Indirect Plaintiffs argue that a damages calculation will require them ""to establish [1] what the price on the CME cheese spot 
market would have been in the absence of the wrongful conduct; [2] how much that caused the price Defendants charged for 
their branded cheese products to retailers or wholesalers to increase; and [3] how much of that increase was passed on to 
Plaintiffs and other consumers."" [521, at 12.] It is the second step that necessarily involves a calculation of the government rate 
because Defendants' sale price was based on the going rate in the national market, which in turn was based, at least in part, on 
government milk prices. "
1567,12," Indirect Plaintiffs argue that California's Cartwright Act does not recognize the filed-rate doctrine for rates set by state rate-
making agencies. See Knevelbaard Dairies v. Kraft Foods, Inc., 232 F.3d 979, 992 (9th Cir. 2000)). Defendants disagree, 
arguing that since Knevelbaard, the tide has changed in California. See MacKay v. Superior Court, 188 Cal. App. 4th 1427, 115 
Cal. Rptr. 3d 893, 910 (Cal Ct. App. 2010). The Court is not convinced that MacKay—an insurance-rate case where the court 
noted ""the limited nature of [its] holding""—expressly overruled what was otherwise established California law. See In re Conseco 
Life Ins. Co. Life Trend Ins. Marketing & Sales Practice Litig., 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 99859, 2012 WL 2917227, at *9-10 (N.D. 
Cal. July 17, 2012) (noting disagreement amongst California courts regarding the [*109]  filed-rate doctrine and refusing to apply 
it). As such, the Court will not apply the filed-rate doctrine to dismiss Indirect Plaintiffs' damages claims based on California law 
regarding rates set by the California Department of Food and Agriculture. This is somewhat of a moot point, as the Court has 
already found dismissal of Indirect Plaintiffs' California-law claims to be appropriate on other grounds. "
1569,13," Because the Court has already deemed Indirect Plaintiffs' monopolization claims dismissible on other grounds, the Court's 
finding regarding their ability to state a claim for monopolization is inconsequential, and the Court provides this ruling only for the 
sake of completeness. "
1570,14," See, e.g., Bowleg v. Bowe, 502 So.2d 71, 72 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1987); ServiceMaster of St. Cloud v. GAB Business Servs., 
Inc., 544 N.W.2d 302, 305 (Minn. 1996); Samiento v. World Yacht Inc., 10 N.Y.3d 70, 883 N.E.2d 990, 996, 854 N.Y.S.2d 83

1570,15," ""Should plaintiffs ultimately be unable to recover under [an antitrust claim], it does not mean [that] a legal remedy was 
unavailable (thereby justifying an equitable remedy of unjust enrichment), but only that their claim lacks merit."" In re Ford 
Tailgate Litig., 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 32287, 2014 WL 1007066, at *5; see also United States v. Bame, 721 F.3d 1025, 1030-32 
(8th Cir. 2013) (noting how Minnesota courts regularly dismiss unjust enrichment claims even where plaintiffs pursue legal and 
equitable claims in the alternative). "
1572,16," Indirect Plaintiffs admit in their complaint that DFA is a ""vertically integrated cooperative of * * * raw milk producers,"" [483, ¶ 
18], but this statement, standing alone, is insufficient to bring Defendants within the scope of the dairymen exemption."
1572,17," The Capper-Volstead Act provides protection for certain agricultural cooperatives, including dairymen, from federal antitrust 
law. See, e.g., Case-Swayne Co. v. Sunkist Growers, Inc., 389 U.S. 384, 389, 88 S. Ct. 528, 19 L. Ed. 2d 621 (1967). "
1575,1," Much of the parties' briefing and accompanying exhibits was filed under seal. The Court will rule on the parties' administrative 
sealing motions by separate order. However, the facts revealed in the instant order, despite citing to documents the parties filed 
entirely under seal, are not sealable. "
1577,2," In 2008, Asustek was the parent company of Pegatron. See InterDigital Tech. Corp. v. Pegatron Corp., No. 13-MC-80087-EJD 
(N.D. Cal. June 11, 2015), ECF No. 17 at 1."
1577,3," Neither party [*11]  disputes that the parties in the instant case are identical to the parties in the Taiwan Action. See ECF No. 
12 at 10; ECF No. 33 at 8. In the instant case, the plaintiffs are three InterDigital entities, and the defendant is Pegatron. See "
1578,," Compl. In the Taiwan Action, Pegatron is the plaintiff, and the same three InterDigital entities are defendants. See Taiwan Action 
at 1. The Court, therefore, focuses its analysis on the similarity of the issues. "
1579,4," By referring to ""dispute resolution provisions,"" the Court is referring to Sections 5.1 and 5.2 of the PLA."
1579,5," The forum selection clause of the PLA is contained within section 6.10 and provides: ""The Parties irrevocably consent to 
exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts in the San Jose Division of the United States District Court for the 
Northern District of California."" PLA § 6.10. "
1580,6," The governing law provision of the PLA is contained within section 6.10 and provides: ""The validity and interpretation of this 
Agreement shall be governed by Delaware law, without regard to conflict of laws principles."" PLA § 6.10."
1580,7," The Federal Arbitration Act ""creates a body of federal substantive law of arbitrability that requires a healthy regard for the 
federal policy favoring arbitration and preempts state law to the contrary."" Farrow v. Fujitsu Am., Inc., 37 F. Supp. 3d 1115, 1119 
(N.D. Cal. 2014) (citing Volt Information Sciences v. Board of Trustees,489 U.S. 468, 475-79, 109 S. Ct. 1248, 103 L. Ed. 2d 488 
(1989). Less clear is whether the interpretation of the arbitration provision is subject to interpretation under state or federal law. 
""When deciding whether the parties agreed to arbitrate a certain [*23]  matter, courts generally apply ordinary state law 
principles of contract interpretation."" Farrow, 37 F. Supp. 3d at 1119 (citing First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U.S. 
938, 944, 115 S. Ct. 1920, 131 L. Ed. 2d 985 (1995)). Thus, in determining whether parties have agreed to arbitrate a dispute, 
the court applies ""general state-law principles of contract interpretation, while giving due regard to the federal policy in favor of 
arbitration by resolving ambiguities as to the scope of arbitration in favor of arbitration."" Mundi v. Union Sec. Life Ins. Co., 555 
F.3d 1042, 1044 (9th Cir. 2009) (quoting Wagner v. Stratton Oakmont, Inc., 83 F.3d 1046, 1049 (9th Cir. 1996)). The Court does 
not, and need not, decide at this juncture whether the Taiwanese claims are subject to mandatory arbitration pursuant to the 
arbitration provision of the PLA. "
1591,*," This summary constitutes no part of the opinion of the court. It has been prepared by court staff for the convenience of the 
reader. "
1595,1," As for the dissent's conclusion that the Plaintiffs waived the Rule 19 issue by ""inviting Judge Rogers to adopt the very analysis 
that they now allege on appeal was erroneous,"" we note that Apple has not asserted a waiver argument. See United States v. "
1596,," Scott, 705 F.3d 410, 415 (9th Cir. 2012) (HN4[
] ""A party who fails to assert a waiver argument forfeits—and therefore implicitly 
waives—that argument.""). "
1598,2," This declaration was again submitted in support of Apple's motion to dismiss in Apple III, and the parties stipulated that it 
referred to the complaint in Apple III. Specifically, the parties stipulated that the ""supporting documents submitted by Apple in 
[Apple II] . . . shall be deemed to refer to the Ward complaint and are properly before the Court in connection with Apple's motion 
to dismiss the Ward complaint."" "
1601,3," Even if ATTM has some lingering contract interests, it may be appropriate for the district court to exercise its discretion to 
fashion the equitable relief in a way that avoids interfering with those interests, instead of dismissing the entire action. See 
Occidental Petroleum Corp. v. Buttes Gas & Oil Co., 331 F. Supp. 92, 105-06 (C.D. Cal. 1971). "
1604,1," The majority apparently believes these particular [**40]  comments do not show that Judge Rogers was confused about why 
Plaintiffs were bringing these issues again after Judge Ware had already ruled on them (demonstrating a concern about claim 
and issue preclusion). The majority thinks they ""could also be interpreted to mean that she had analyzed the issue and was 
inclined to issue the same ruling as Judge Ware."" With due respect, nothing in these statements can plausibly be construed as 
indicating that Judge Rogers had at this point deliberately analyzed the Rule 19 issue, and they certainly cannot be construed as 
her inclination to ""issue the same ruling as Judge Ware."" Although our jurisdiction does not depend on what is said in the give-
and-take between counsel and judge at an oral hearing, the transcript in this case, as will become apparent below, strongly 
suggests that Judge Rogers never in fact made an independent decision on the Rule 19 issue. "
1621,1," The factual background presented here is drawn from the district court's factual findings or from undisputed material in the 
record before the district court. HN1[
] Because this Court reviews the district court's factual findings for ""clear error,"" we must 
assess whether ""its view of the evidence is plausible in light of the entire record."" Cosme v. Henderson, 287 F.3d 152, 158 (2d 
Cir. 2002). In light of this obligation, the dissent is wrong to suggest that citations to the record are inappropriate or misleading. 
When a fact comes from the district court's opinion, we cite that opinion; [**11]  when one comes from the record, we cite the 
joint appendix (""J.A.""). "
1623,2," Citing one example, the district court referenced a fall 2009 email in which Hachette's Young informed his colleague Nourry of 
Simon & Schuster's windowing plans, advising ""[c]ompletely confidentially, Carolyn [Reidy] has told me that they [Simon & 
Schuster] are delaying the new Stephen King, with his full support, but will not be announcing this until the day after Labor Day."" 
Apple, 952 F. Supp. 2d at 652 (first and second alterations in original) (internal quotation marks omitted). The district court went 
on to observe that Young, ""[u]nderstanding the impropriety of this exchange of confidential information with a competitor, . . . 
advised Nourry that 'it would be prudent for you to double [**18]  delete this from your email files when you return to your office.'"" 
Id. "
1625,3," Notably, the possibility of an agency arrangement was first mentioned by Hachette and HarperCollins as a way ""to fix Amazon 
pricing."" J.A. 346. "
1626,4," Cue testified at trial that his reference to ""solv[ing] the Amazon issue"" denoted [**27]  the proposal to price ebooks in the 
iBookstore above $9.99, and was not a reference to raising prices across the industry or wresting control over pricing from 
Amazon. In this and other respects, the district court found Cue's testimony to be ""not credible"" — a determination that, on this 
record, is in no manner erroneous, much less clearly so. Id. at 661 n.19. As the district court put it, ""Apple's pitch to the 
Publishers was — from beginning to end — a vision for a new industry-wide price schedule."" Id. "
1627,5," As one HarperCollins executive put it, the ""upshot"" of moving to the agency model and adopting price caps was that ""Apple 
would control price and that price would be standard across the industry."" Apple, 952 F. Supp. 2d at 670 (internal quotation 
marks omitted). "
1628,6," Although Cue denied discussing the MFN that night, the district court found this testimony not credible in light of Cue's 
deposition testimony and his contemporaneous email to Jobs that Sargent had ""legal concerns over the price-matching."" Apple, 
952 F. Supp. 2d at 672 n.38 (internal quotation marks omitted). This determination was not clearly erroneous. "
1629,7," Indeed, on the morning of January 21, Apple's initial deadline for the publishers to commit to agency, Simon & Schuster's Reidy 
emailed Cue to get ""an update on your progress in herding us cats."" J.A. 543."
1629,8," On January 29, Simon & Schuster's general counsel wrote to Reidy that she ""[could not] believe that Jobs made [this] 
statement,"" which she considered ""[i]ncredibly stupid."" J.A. 638."
1629,9," As the district court found, ""[s]even months was no random period — it was the number of months for which titles were 
designated New Release titles under the Apple Agreement and restrained by the Apple price caps and MFN."" Apple, 952 F. 
Supp. 2d at 679."
1629,10," At trial, Cue claimed he had no advance knowledge of Sargent's plan to go to Seattle, but the district court found this 
testimony to be incredible. Sargent had emailed Cue about his trip days before the meeting took place. Moreover, on January 
28, the day of the meeting, Jobs told his biographer that the Publisher Defendants ""went to Amazon and said, 'You're going to 
sign an agency contract or we're not going to give you the books.'"" Apple, 952 F. Supp. 2d at 678 n.47. The district court's 
assessment of Cue's credibility was not clearly erroneous. "
1630,11," As the district court noted, Macmillan had executed its Contract with Apple a week earlier, so that ""the only final agency terms 
still under discussion were with Amazon."" Apple, 952 F. Supp. 2d at 681 n.52."
1630,12," Eventually, the Publisher Defendants negotiated agency agreements with Barnes & Noble, and later Google. Random House 
also adopted the agency model, and joined the iBookstore, in early 2011. "
1631,13," The five Publisher Defendants accounted for 48.8% of all retail trade ebook sales in the United States during the first quarter 
of 2010."
1631,14," A weighted average price controls for the fact that different ebooks sell in different quantities by dividing the total price that 
consumers paid for ebooks by the total number of ebooks sold. "
1634,15," In this sense, the ""hub-and-spoke"" metaphor is somewhat inaccurate — the plaintiff must also prove the existence of a ""rim"" to 
the wheel in the form of an agreement among the horizontal competitors. See Dickson v. Microsoft Corp., 309 F.3d 193, 203-04 
(4th Cir. 2002). "
1636,16," Apple's argument on appeal that it did not have sufficient market power to coordinate the Publisher Defendants is beside the 
point. Market power may afford one means by which a company can coerce others to comply with its wishes, but brute force is 
not the only way to foster an agreement. Here, both Apple and the Publisher Defendants understood that Apple was in a position 
to ""solve"" the publishers' ""Amazon problem"" by helping them eliminate what they saw as a mortal threat to their businesses — 
namely, the $9.99 price point. "
1637,17," Apple endeavors to draw the district court's factfinding into doubt by asserting, erroneously, that the ""bedrock of the court's 
entire decision"" hinges on its supposed determination that Apple, knowing that the publishers had been coordinating 
beforehand, joined a preexisting conspiracy to raise prices at its initial meetings with the Publisher Defendants — a proposition 
that, it says, is unsupported by the record. The district court, however, did not find that Apple joined an ongoing conspiracy in 
late 2009, but merely observed that Apple went into its initial meetings with the understanding that the Publisher Defendants 
disliked, and were [**69]  trying to fight, Amazon's $9.99 pricing, and so would be receptive to the news that Apple was open to 
higher prices. See Apple, 952 F. Supp. 2d at 703. These findings were amply supported and help explain how the agreement 
among Apple and the Publisher Defendants thereafter emerged."
1637,18," Apple takes issue with the district court's conclusion that Apple was aware of, and facilitated, communication between the 
Publisher Defendants. But the district court found that Cue believed Reidy was a ""leader"" in the publishing industry and that, on 
at least two occasions toward the end of the negotiating period, Cue called a recalcitrant executive, who then spoke to Reidy 
before agreeing to Apple's terms. See Apple, 952 F. Supp. 2d at 659-60; J.A. 2019-20. Reidy herself adverted to Cue's role in 
""herding us cats."" J.A. 543. Moreover, the publishing executives frequently denied having any conversations about Apple during 
this period, despite strong documentary and phone record evidence to the contrary. The district court found that these denials 
lacked credibility and ""strongly support[ed] a finding of consciousness of guilt."" Apple, 952 F. Supp. 2d at 693 n.59. This view of 
the facts is not clearly erroneous. "
1638,19," Nor does our holding remotely suggest that price caps are always unlawful, [**73]  which they are not. See State Oil Co. v. 
Khan, 522 U.S. 3, 118 S. Ct. 275, 139 L. Ed. 2d 199 (1997) (holding that vertical maximum price-fixing agreements should be 
analyzed under the rule of reason). Apple required price caps because it knew that once the Publisher Defendants moved on 
Amazon to seize control over ebook prices, they would raise them. Apple wanted to ensure that the Publisher Defendants set 
""realistic prices"" that reflected the lower costs of producing ebooks. J.A. 359. The Publisher Defendants and Apple understood 
that these caps would become the ""standard across the industry."" J.A. 573. The price negotiations therefore reflected a common 
understanding that prices would rise, but a difference of opinion among the co-conspirators over how high they could reasonably 
go. See United States v. Andreas, 216 F.3d 645, 680 (7th Cir. 2000) (""The need to negotiate some details of the conspiracy with 
the cartel members . . . does not strip a defendant of the organizer role.""). "
1642,20," Since Leegin, the Sixth Circuit has acknowledged that plaintiffs can ""establish[] a per se violation [of the Sherman Act] under 
the hub and spoke theory."" Total Benefits Planning Agency, Inc. v. Anthem Blue Cross & Blue Shield, 552 F.3d 430, 435 n.3 (6th 
Cir. 2008). To the extent that the Third Circuit decided otherwise in Toledo Mack Sales & Serv., Inc. v. Mack Trucks, Inc., 530 
F.3d 204, 225 (3d Cir. 2008), its more recent opinions cast doubt on that decision. In In re Insurance Brokerage Antitrust 
Litigation, for example, the court noted that ""hub-and-spoke conspiracies"" have ""a long history in antitrust jurisprudence,"" and 
cited Total Benefits for the position that ""[t]he critical issue for establishing a per se violation with the hub and spoke system is 
how the spokes are connected to each other."" 618 F.3d 300, 327 (3d Cir. 2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). The court 
also acknowledged that ""[t]he anticompetitive danger inherent"" in alleged horizontal collusion ""is not necessarily mitigated by the 
fact that"" a broker at [**86]  a different level of the market structure ""managed the details of each bid, nor by the likelihood that 
the horizontal collusion would not have occurred without the broker's involvement."" Id. at 338. The panel in Insurance Brokerage, 
however, had no occasion to revisit Toledo Mack because the plaintiffs had failed to establish a horizontal agreement — the 
""rim"" in the hub-and-spokes conspiracy. Id. at 362. "
1644,21," Significantly, the Publisher Defendants are all major producers of new releases and New York Times bestsellers, and they 
collectively increased prices in those categories. Those prices remained high notwithstanding the influx of new publishers and 
low-cost ebooks, to the detriment of consumers interested in that segment of the market. See 42nd Parallel N. v. E St. Denim 
Co., 286 F.3d 401, 405-06 (7th Cir. 2002) (HN31[
] ""The key inquiry in a market power analysis is whether the defendant has "
1645,," the ability to raise prices without losing its business."" (internal quotation marks omitted)); K.M.B. Warehouse Distribs., Inc. v. 
Walker Mfg. Co., 61 F.3d 123, 128-29 (2d Cir. 1995); cf. U.S. Dep't of Justice & Fed. Trade Comm'n, Horizontal Merger 
Guidelines § 6.1 (2010) (noting that, ""[i]n differentiated product industries, some products can be very close substitutes . . . while 
other products are more distant substitutes""). "
1647,22," While the dissent accuses us of supposing that ""competition should be genteel, lawyer-designed, and fair under sporting 
rules,"" Dissenting Op. at 5, it is the dissent's position that would have ebook consumers subsidize Apple's entry into the market 
by paying more for ebooks so that Apple would not have to compete on price. "
1648,23," A prediction that consumers would have paid more to read ebooks on the iPad than on the Kindle because of the iPad's 
improved reading experience or other attractive features does not somehow suggest that ebooks are ""Veblen goods [or] Giffen 
goods."" Dissenting Op. at 33 n.7. The dissent also suggests that Apple could not have depended on the iPad's hardware 
advantages as part of a strategy to charge more than Amazon because antitrust law would have required it to open up the iPad 
to a Kindle app. Id. at 34. But for a unilateral refusal to deal to be unlawful, the defendant must have monopoly power, which 
Apple plainly did not. See, e.g., United States v. Microsoft Corp., 253 F.3d 34, 51, 346 U.S. App. D.C. 330 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (en 
banc) (HN38[
] ""While merely possessing monopoly power is not itself an antitrust violation, it is a necessary element of a 
monopolization charge."" (citation omitted)); Elhauge, supra, at 268 (HN39[
] ""A firm that lacks dominant market [**110]  power 
. . . can unilaterally choose with whom they deal without fear of antitrust liability.""); see also Trinko, 540 U.S. at 408 (HN40[
] ""Under certain circumstances, a refusal to cooperate with rivals can constitute anticompetitive conduct and violate § 2. We have 
been very cautious in recognizing such exceptions, because of the uncertain virtue of forced sharing and the difficulty of 
identifying and remedying anticompetitive conduct by a single firm.""). "
1649,24," Apple sought to introduce expert testimony from Dr. Michelle Burtis, which it believed would link continued long-term growth 
and price changes to its launch of the iBookstore. However, the district court excluded this testimony on the grounds that Dr. 
Burtis ""did not offer any scientifically sound analysis of the cause for this purported price decline or seek to control for the factors 
that may have led to it."" Apple, 952 F. Supp. 2d at 694 n.61. This was no abuse of discretion. See Zerega Ave. Realty, 571 F.3d 
at 212-13. HN41[
] ""[T]he proponent of expert testimony has the burden of establishing [**114]  by a preponderance of the 
evidence"" that the expert's opinion is based on sufficient facts, is the product of reliable principles and methods, and applies 
those principles and methods reliably to the facts at hand. United States v. Williams, 506 F.3d 151, 160 (2d Cir. 2007); see Fed. 
R. Evid. 702. Dr. Burtis merely compared the average ebook prices from the two years before Apple's entry into the market with 
the average prices two years after. She did not account for the rapid growth and change in that industry or explain the process 
she used to determine whether Apple's agency agreements were responsible for lower prices. See Gen. Elec. Co. v. Joiner, 522 
U.S. 136, 146, 118 S. Ct. 512, 139 L. Ed. 2d 508 (1997); United States v. Dukagjini, 326 F.3d 45, 54 (2d Cir. 2003). The district 
court therefore acted well within its discretion in excluding Dr. Burtis's testimony. "
1650,25," Macmillan also contends that the injunctive order broadens the restrictions imposed by its consent decree [**118]  because 
the decree allows the company to set certain limits on price discounts, which it can no longer set for ebooks sold by Apple. "
1652,26," Apple also argues that the district court's decision to appoint a monitor to supervise the company's compliance with the 
injunction went beyond its powers under the Sherman Act and violated both Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 53 and separation-
of-powers principles. Apple devoted only two conclusory sentences to these three separate facial challenges to the district 
court's authority. We therefore deem the arguments forfeited and do not consider them. Frank v. United States, 78 F.3d 815, 833 
(2d Cir. 1996) (HN46[

n.7 (2d Cir. 2005). We also note that, following Rule 53's amendment in 2003, the Advisory Committee stated that HN47[
] 
""[r]eliance on a master"" appointed under that Rule ""is appropriate when a complex decree requires complex policing, particularly 
when a party has proved resistant or intransigent,"" and that both the Supreme Court and this Court have approved such 
appointments. Fed. R. Civ. P. 53 advisory committee's note (2003 Amendments) (citing Local 38 of the Sheet Metal Workers'

N.Y. Land Co., 852 F.2d 33, 36-37 (2d Cir. 1988) (collecting cases). In light of this background, it would be inappropriate to 
excuse Apple's failure to argue and for this panel [**124]  to entertain its facial challenges to the district court's authority on the 
scant briefing before us. Judge Jacobs, who sat on a separate panel of this Court that considered an as-applied challenge to the monitor's conduct, 
contends that ""the injunction warps the role of a neutral, court-appointed referee into that of an adversary party."" Dissenting Op. 
at 36. Whatever the merits of this argument, it is not properly before us on this appeal. Here, Apple has asserted only (and 
without argumentation of any sort) that appointing a monitor, in general, violates the Sherman Act, Rule 53, and separation-of-
powers principles. The dissent's position eschews that broad facial challenge and instead focuses on the conduct of the monitor 
in this particular case, drawing entirely on a record not before this panel, but presented to a separate panel in another appeal. 
See United States v. Apple Inc., 787 F.3d 131, 2015 U.S. App. LEXIS 8854, 2015 WL 3405534 (2d Cir. 2015). We do not 
believe it is proper to resolve this appeal with reference to arguments that Apple has failed to make. "
1655,1," The parties did not dispute this market definition. Apple I, 952 F. Supp. 2d at 694 n.60."
1655,2," While the district court did not use the label ""barrier to entry,"" its findings of fact made the point clearly. In finding that a new 
entrant to e-book retail in 2009 ""would run the risk of losing money if it tried or was forced to match Amazon's pricing to [**135]  
remain competitive,"" Apple I, 952 F. Supp. 2d at 658, the district court left no doubt that the effect of Amazon's below-cost 
pricing regime was to ""impede entry and protect existing market power""--the basic operation of a barrier to entry, 2B Areeda & 
Hovenkamp, supra, ¶ 420c, at 78. "
1656,," The majority disputes whether there was any barrier to entry under Amazon's below-cost pricing regime, because at least one 
competitor attempted to join the market. See Op. of Judge Livingston, ante, at 13 (for the Court), 100. Even if that entrant had 
any chance of success (nobody contends that it sold a meaningful number of e-books, or made any money, or reduced 
Amazon's mammoth market share to less than 90 percent), that fact need not imply ease of entry because ""a barrier may protect 
a market incumbent without completely excluding entry."" 2B Areeda & Hovenkamp, supra, ¶ 420a, at 73. "
1659,3," The cases are cited by the majority in this order: Klor's, Inc. v. Broadway-Hale Stores, Inc., 359 U.S. 207, 79 S. Ct. 705, 3 L. 
Ed. 2d 741 (1959); United States v. General Motors Corp., 384 U.S. 127, 86 S. Ct. 1321, 16 L. Ed. 2d 415 (1966); Toys ""R"" Us, 
Inc. v. FTC, 221 F.3d 928 (7th Cir. 2000); Denny's Marina, Inc. v. Renfro Productions, Inc., 8 F.3d 1217 (7th Cir. 1993); United 
States v. MMR Corp., 907 F.2d 489 (5th Cir. 1990); Business Electronics Corp. v. Sharp Electronics Corp., 485 U.S. 717, 108 S. 
Ct. 1515, 99 L. Ed. 2d 808 (1988); NYNEX Corp. v. Discon, Inc., 525 U.S. 128, 119 S. Ct. 493, 142 L. Ed. 2d 510 (1998). Just as unhelpfully, the majority cites dicta from a Sixth Circuit case affirming the dismissal of a lawsuit that alleged a hub-and-
spokes conspiracy. See Total Benefits Planning Agency, Inc. v. Anthem Blue Cross & Blue Shield, 552 F.3d 430 (6th Cir. 2008). 
The majority cites the case as if its holding supports the continued legitimacy of the hub-and-spokes theory after Leegin, a 
flawed interpretation given the Sixth Circuit's disposition on the hub-and-spokes claim. Id. at 435 (holding that plaintiffs 
inadequately alleged a horizontal conspiracy and that, after Leegin, ""all vertical price restraints are to be judged under the rule-
of-reason standard"" (emphasis added))."
1659,4," The Third Circuit [**147]  analyzed a network of restraints, including a conspiracy among insurance brokers, a conspiracy 
among insurers, and agreements that connected the brokers and insurers. The court explained Leegin's impact this way: Under the Supreme Court's jurisprudence, virtually all vertical agreements now receive a traditional rule-of-reason analysis. 
See Leegin, 551 U.S. 877, 127 S. Ct. 2705, 168 L. Ed. 2d 623. In the factual context of this case, a horizontal agreement 
means . . . an agreement among either the brokers or the insurers in the global conspiracy. Agreements between brokers 
and insurers, on the other hand, are vertical and would have to be analyzed under the traditional rule of reason. In re Ins. Brokerage Antitrust Litig., 618 F.3d 300, 318-19 (3d Cir. 2010) (internal citation and footnote omitted). "
1662,5," Generally speaking, entry barriers permit monopolization and monopoly power allows a firm to erect entry barriers. See, e.g., 
Port Dock & Stone Corp. v. Oldcastle Ne., Inc., 507 F.3d 117, 125 (2d Cir. 2007); United States v. Microsoft Corp., 253 F.3d 34, 
82, 346 U.S. App. D.C. 330 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (en banc); see also Mobil Oil Corp. v. Fed. Power Comm'n, 417 U.S. 283, 302 n.23, 
94 S. Ct. 2328, 41 L. Ed. 2d 72 (1974). Each is less likely to arise when the other is absent from a market."
1662,6," Amazons's below-cost prices also threatened the market for hard-copy books, see Apple I, 952 F. Supp. 2d at 649, and thus 
the royalties of authors, who may well consider that they have some role in this industry. "
1663,7," In economic terms, e-books are subject to the law of demand and therefore have negative price elasticity of demand. See 
generally N. Gregory Mankiw, Principles of Economics 67 (6th ed. 2012). E-books are neither Veblen goods nor Giffen goods, 
nor do they have perfectly inelastic demand. See id. at 92-93, 453-54, 835; Laurie Simon Bagwell & B. Douglas Bernheim, 
Veblen Effects in a Theory of Conspicuous Consumption, 86 Am. Econ. Rev. 349 (1996). "
1670,1," The controlling antitrust law, however, limits the Court from drawing certain inferences. See Analysis Section I(A)(1) below."
1670,2," The Designers are: Allure, Blush, House of Wu, Jasz Couture, Jovani, La Femme, Mac Duggal, Flirt (aka Maggie Sottero, Mori 
Lee, Party Time, Riva Designs, Scala, Sherri Hill, Tarik Ediz, Terani, and Tony Bowls. (R. 270, Pl.'s Resp. to Defs.' SOF ¶ 7.)"
1670,3," To the extent Plaintiff disputes only a portion of a statement of fact, the Court deems the remaining portion admitted. See N.D. 
Ill. L.R. 56.1(b)(3)(C) (""All material facts set forth in the statement required of the moving party will be deemed to be admitted 
unless controverted by the statement of the opposing party."")"
1670,4," Plaintiff argues that the relevant geographic market for antitrust purposes is the ""Chicago Market,"" which it defines as 
encompassing area codes 630/331, 847/224, 708, 312/872, and 773. (R. 250-1, Schafer Rep. ¶ 12.) "
1671,5," Plaintiff [**7]  objects to several of Defendants' statements of fact based on its Daubert motion. The Court denied that motion, 
however, in its June 19, 2015 Opinion. (R. 329, Kneuper Opinion.)"
1671,6, Plaintiff's Statement of Facts does not provide an exact number. 
1672,7," Plaintiff also alleges that Peaches' conduct constitutes illegal monopolization and unreasonable restraint of trade under the 
Illinois Antitrust Act, 740 ILCS 10/3. (R. 188, Am. Compl. ¶ 262.) Plaintiff does not dispute that those sections of the Illinois 
Antitrust Act are based on Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, and therefore the applicable legal standards are the same. See 
740 ILCS 10/11 (""When the wording of this Act is identical or similar to that of a federal antitrust law, the courts of this State 
shall use the construction of the federal law by the federal courts as a guide in construing this Act.""); Laughlin v. Evanston Hosp., 
133 Ill.2d 374, 383-84, 140 Ill.Dec. 861, 550 N.E.2d 986 (1990) (applying decisions construing Section 1 of Sherman Act to claim 
for unreasonable restraint of trade brought under the Illinois Antitrust Act); Int'l Equip. Trading, Ltd. v. AB SCIEX, LLC, No. 13-C-
1129, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 123109, 2013 WL 4599903, at *3 n.1 (Aug. 29, 2013) (applying Sherman Act Section 2 analysis to 
attempted monopolization claim brought under the Illinois Antitrust Act). "
1676,8," See, e.g., Endsley v. City of Chicago, 230 F.3d 276, 282 (7th Cir. 2000) (""The offense of monopoly under § 2 of the Sherman 
Act has two elements: (1) the possession of monopoly power in the relevant market and (2) the willful acquisition or maintenance 
of that power as distinguished from growth or development as a consequence of a superior product, business acumen, or 
historic accident."") "
1679,9," Although the parties do not discuss it, Plantiff also pleads a Count XII which seeks a declaratory [**37]  judgment under 28 
U.S.C. § 2201 that the exclusive agreements between Peaches and the Designers are illegal under the Sherman Act and 
unenforceable under Illinois law. (R. 188, Am. Compl. ¶¶ 299-305.) Given the Court's summary judgment ruling, the Court 
dismisses Count XII with prejudice to the extent it seeks a declaratory judgment with respect to the Antitrust Claims, and without 
prejudice to the extent it seeks a declaratory judgment with respect to the remaining Illinois state law claims. "
1686,1," Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. and Ferrellgas, L.P. will be collectively referred to as ""Ferrellgas."" Ferrellgas does business under the 
name Blue Rhino. (Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs' Consolidated Class Action Complaint (""Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs' CAC"") ¶ 1)."

1687,3," The Direct and Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs are referred to collectively as ""Plaintiffs."""
1687,4, This 2009 action will be referred to as In re Propane I. 
1689,5," The Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs also raise a claim for injunctive relief under Section 1 of the Sherman Act. (Indirect Purchaser 
Plaintiffs' CAC ¶ 139). The timeliness of this claim will be addressed separately below. Additionally, the Indirect Purchaser 
Plaintiffs assert claims for violation of state antitrust laws. (Id. ¶¶ 156, 164-185). "
1691,6, Ken Janish is AmeriGas's Director of National Accounts. (Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs' CAC ¶ 9). 
1692,7," Plaintiffs however, admit that this tolling theory is inapplicable to Defendant UGI Corporation. (Doc. # 148, p. 12 n.8; Doc. # 
149, p. 26 n.30). Accordingly, no tolling theory is sufficient to prevent Plaintiffs' claims against UGI Corporation from being barred 
by the statute of limitations. Thus, Plaintiffs claims against UGI Corporation are DISMISSED. "
1694,8," The Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs' state law antitrust claims are governed by the same American Pipe standards as their 
Sherman Act claim. The Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs' bring state law claims under the antitrust laws of Kansas, Arizona, 
California, the District of Columbia, Florida, Iowa, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, 
New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. (Indirect 
Purchaser Plaintiffs' CAC ¶¶ 156, 164-185). Many of these states have explicitly adopted American Pipe. See e.g. Great Plains 
Trust Co., 492 F.3d at 997 (""Kansas has accordingly adopted the American Pipe rule.""); Albano v. Shea Homes Ltd. P'ship, 227 
Ariz. 121, 254 P.3d 360, 364 (Ariz. 2011) (en banc); Am. Tierra Corp. v. City of W. Jordan, 840 P.2d 757, 762 (Utah 1992); 
Lucas v. Pioneer, Inc., 256 N.W.2d 167, 180 (Iowa 1977); Maestas v. Sofamor Danek Grp., Inc., No. 02A01-9804-CV-00099, 
1999 Tenn. App. LEXIS 97, 1999 WL 74212, at *5 (Tenn. Ct. App. Feb. 16, 1999); Lee v. Grand Rapids Bd. of Educ., 148 Mich. 
App. 364, 384 N.W.2d 165, 168 (Mich. Ct. App. 1986). Even for those states that have not explicitly adopted American Pipe, the 
Eighth Circuit has held that ""the federal interest in 'the efficiency and economy of the class-action procedure' outweighs any 
state interest and therefore justifies tolling in diversity cases where the otherwise-applicable state law provides no relief."" In re 
Gen. Am. Life Ins. Co. Sales Practices Litig., 391 F.3d at 915 (quoting Adams Pub. Sch. Dist. v. Asbestos Corp., Ltd., 7 F.3d 
717, 718-19 (8th Cir. 1993)). "
1696,9," For example, the Third Circuit in Pennsylvania Dental Association v. Med. Service Association of Pennsylvania, 815 F.2d 270 
(3d Cir. 1987) assumed that the statute of limitations applied. "

Administration (""FDA"") to sell generic versions of those products. On September 30, 2006, Plaintiffs filed with the FDA an 
Abbreviated New Drug Application (""ANDA"") seeking FDA approval of a generic version of Effexor. On March 13, 2007, 
Wyeth, the branded manufacturer of Effexor, sued SPI for a declaratory judgment that LPI's generic version of Effexnor 
would infringe Wyeth's patent. Wyeth and LPI settled the litigation on May 11, 2009. . . . On July 30, 2009, LPI filed an ANDA seeking FDA approval of a generic version of Loestrin. On September 9, 2009, 
Warner-Chilcott, [*4]  the branded manufacturer of Loestrin, sued LPI for a declaratory judgment that LPI's generic version

1699,4," Section 45.50.592 states in full: (a) If the attorney general determines that a person is in possession, custody, or control of documentary evidence, 
wherever situated, that the attorney general believes to be relevant to an investigation authorized in AS 45.50.590, the 
attorney general may execute in writing and cause to be served on that person an investigative demand requiring the 
person to produce the documentary material, and permit inspection and copying. (b) Each demand must (1) state the specific statute the alleged violation of which is under investigation, and the general subject matter of the 
investigation; (2) describe, with reasonable specificity so as fairly to indicate the material demanded, the documentary material to be 
produced; (3) prescribe a return date within which the documentary material is to be produced; and (4) identify the state employees or representatives to whom the documentary material is to be made available for 
inspection and copying. (c) A demand may not (1) require the production of documentary material that would [*6]  be privileged from disclosure if demanded by a 
subpoena duces tecum issued by a court of the state; or (2) contain a requirement that would be unreasonable or improper if contained in a subpoena duces tecum issued by a 
court of the state; however, this does not limit the power of the attorney general to require production of documents 
located outside the state that pertain to matters affecting the state. "
1700,," (d) The demand may be served by the attorney general or the designee of the attorney general by (1) delivering a copy of it to the person to be served or, if the person is not a natural person, to an officer of the person 
to be served; (2) delivering a copy of it to a place of business in the state of the person to be served; or (3) mailing by registered or certified mail a copy of it addressed to the person to be served at a place of business in the 
state or, if the person has no place of business in the state, to the principal office or place of business of the person. (e) Documentary material produced pursuant to a demand, or copies of it, unless otherwise ordered by a superior court for 
good cause shown, may not be produced for inspection or copying by, nor may its contents be disclosed [*7]  to, anyone 
other than an authorized employee of the state without the consent of the person who produced the material. However, 
under those reasonable terms and conditions the attorney general prescribes, copies of the documentary material shall be 
available for inspection and copying by the person who produced the material or an authorized representative of that 
person. The attorney general, or a designee, may use copies of the documentary material as the attorney general or 
designee considers necessary in the enforcement of AS 45.50.562-45.50.598, including presentation before a court; 
however, material that contains trade secrets may not be presented except with the approval of the court in which the 
action is pending after adequate notice to the person furnishing the material. (f) At any time before the return date specified in the demand, or within 20 days after the demand has been served, 
whichever period is shorter, a petition to extend the return date for, or to modify or set aside a demand issued under (a) of 
this section, stating good cause, may be filed in the superior court for the judicial district where the parties reside. A petition 
by a person on whom a demand is served, [*8]  stating good cause, to require the attorney general or another person to act 
in accordance with the requirements of (e) of this section, and all other petitions in connection with a demand, may be filed 
in the superior court for the judicial district in which the person on whom the demand is served resides. (g) A person on whom a demand is served under this section shall comply with the terms of the demand unless otherwise 
provided by an order of court issued in response to a petition filed under (f) of this section. A person who, with intent to 
avoid, prevent, or obstruct compliance, in whole or in part, with an investigative demand under this section, removes from 
any place, conceals, withholds, or destroys, mutilates, alters, or by any other means falsifies, documentary material in the 
possession, custody, or control of a person that is the subject of a demand duly served on any person, or who otherwise 
wilfully disobeys any such demand, is guilty of a misdemeanor, and is punishable upon conviction by a fine of not more 
than $5,000, or by imprisonment for a term of not more than one year, or by both. Failure of the state to serve the demand 
properly under (d) of this section is a [*9]  defense to prosecution under this subsection, but invalidity of the demand under 
(b) or (c) of this section is not a defense, and that invalidity may be tested only in an action under (f) of this section to 
modify or set aside the demand. (h) Nothing in this section impairs the authority of the attorney general or a designee to lay before a grand jury of this state 
evidence concerning a violation of AS 45.50.562 - 45.50.596, to invoke the power of a court to compel the production of 
evidence before a grand jury, or to file a civil complaint or criminal information alleging a violation of AS 45.50.562 - 
45.50.596. "
1701,5," The Court refers to this case as ""the Alaska Proceeding."" "
1702,6," This Court recognizes that the Defendant Attorney General raised several other issues in its motion to dismiss, including 
arguments pertaining to failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6) under the Dormant Commerce Clause of the United States 
Constitution, see U.S. Const. art. 1, § 8, cl.3, ripeness doctrine, absolute prosecutorial immunity, and qualified immunity. These 
issues were fully briefed, although the majority of the parties' papers focused on the abstention issue, and argument at the June 
26, 2015 hearing was limited to the abstention issue as well. Because this Court finds that Younger abstention is proper, this 
Court does not reach these other issues raised by the parties. "
1703,7," These cases include Temple of the Lost Sheep, Inc. v. Abrams, 761 F. Supp. 237, 242-43 (E.D.N.Y. 1989), and Cuomo v. 
Dreamland Amusements, Inc., 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 71432, 2008 WL 4369270, at *10 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 22, 2008)."
1703,8," Notably, the district court also found that the subpoena had been issued in bad faith by the attorney general in response 
to [*17]  Google's refusal to comply with certain requests made by the attorney general concerning Google's services."
1703,9," In light of this Court's holding with respect to the third Younger category, this Court sees no need to address the issue whether 
the Alaska Proceeding qualifies as a civil enforcement action akin to a criminal prosecution under the second Younger category."
1703,10," The Lupin Plaintiffs' argument on this point refers to three factors recognized in Middlesex County Ethics Committee v. Garden 
State Bar Association, 457 U.S. 423, 102 S. Ct. 2515, 73 L. Ed. 2d 116 (1982): (1) whether there is an ongoing state judicial 
proceeding; (2) whether the proceedings implicate important state interest; and (3) whether there is an adequate opportunity in 
the state proceedings to raise constitutional challenges. See id. at 432. In Sprint, the Supreme Court clarified that these factors 
were ""additional factors appropriated considered by the federal court before invoking Younger"" rather than ""dispositive"" 
conditions. See 134 S. Ct. at 593. "
1708,1, The lawsuit was dismissed against Mr. Cardella for lack of personal jurisdiction. 
1709,2," The second amended counterclaims asserted the following causes of action against MRIS and NAR: (1) unfair competition 
under Maryland law; (2) unfair competition under California law; and (3) violation of the Sherman Act § 1. (See ECF No. 167)."
1709,3," NAR filed a second notice of supplemental authority on February 17, 2015, stating that AHRN had appealed the summary 
judgment order to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, but subsequently sought to dismiss the appeal. (ECF 
No. 433). "
1710,4," As Judge Williams stated in his earlier opinion, ""the viability of AHRN's unfair competition claim under Maryland law [] relies on 
the [*11]  same set of facts as the Sherman Act § 1 claim"" and the parties do not dispute this point. (ECF No. 239, at 12 n.7). "
1711,5," In Re Titanium Dioxide Antitrust Litigation did not involve allegations of group [*15]  boycott, however, as is the case here. "
1712,6," Laurene Janik testified that although NAR allocated certain funds to support the lawsuit instituted by MRIS, the funds were not 
actually paid from NAR to MRIS. (ECF No. 410-4, at 11). She did not know why MRIS did not accept the funds. "
1713,7," Judge Williams later reconsidered the June 10, 2013 opinion insofar as it dismissed the claims for violations of Section 1 of the 
Sherman Act and unfair competition under Maryland law as to MRIS because he had to rely on materials outside the four 
corners of the complaint in determining the application of Noerr-Pennington immunity. (See ECF No. 239, at 2). Summary 
judgment was granted on both counterclaims as to MRIS by memorandum opinion and order issued on March 10, 2014. (ECF 
Nos. 351, 352, 355)."
1713,8," In Professional Real Estate Investors, Inc. v. Columbia Pictures Indus., 508 U.S. 49, 60, 113 S. Ct. 1920, 123 L. Ed. 2d 611 
(1993) (""PRE""), the Supreme Court of the United States fashioned a two-part sham-litigation test as an exception to Noerr-
Pennington immunity. "
1714,9," AHRN contends that ""[t]he letters pouring into AHRN's office in the wake of the November 2011 NAR annual meetings is 
evidence of NAR's discouraging local associations, boards, brokers and agents from dealing with AHRN."" (ECF No. 422, at 25). 
NAR provides evidence, however, that even before the Anaheim meeting in November 2011 when NAR purportedly became 
aware of AHRN's website, an attorney representing an MLS in Wisconsin, and not NAR, sent an email to a group of MLSs (and 
their attorneys) informing them about the operations of NeighborCity: It appears that there is a website (neighborcity.com ) which is displaying some of the copyrighted data of my client. A[] 
quick check of this site reveals that they are not limited to Wisconsin but also display some but not all other areas (Chicago 
[49,000 listings], Minneapolis [*23]  [5000 listings], Detroit [726 listings], Denver [10877 listings]) in which I would strongly 
suspect they do not have consent to do so. My clients in Wisconsin are proceeding with the proper ways to protect ourselves and hold them accountable, but the 
people involved make me suspect that this is not a fly-by-night operation. Accordingly, I would like to know if any of you 
have had any contact or interaction with either neighborcity.com or the company American Home Realty Network, Inc. or 
it[s] CEO Jonathan Cardella. (ECF No. 410-27, at 2; see also ECF No. 410-21 (Aug. 27, 2010 cease and desist letter); 410-22 (Mar. 22, 2011 cease and 
desist letter). "
1719,10," AHRN also relies on the ""group boycott"" theory to show an unreasonable restraint of trade by way of a ""per se"" violation of 
Section 1 of the Sherman Act. For the reasons explained above, it has not established a group boycott, thus its antitrust claim 
cannot survive summary judgment. "
1725,1, Thomas' attempts to intervene in this action [*9]  were denied by Magistrate Judge Pitman. Dkt. 93. 
1726,2," As to subject matter jurisdiction, federal question jurisdiction is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 on the basis of Plaintiff's Title VII 
and RICO claims. The parties also do not dispute that diversity jurisdiction exists pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1332. "
1727,3," The parties have not briefed choice of law as to the preliminary question of whether the Flannery Defendants and Plaintiff were 
CGL partners. Ordinarily, this choice of law question is resolved by reference to the partnership agreement, which typically 
contains a choice-of-law provision. In the absence of such an agreement, New York law provides that ""the laws of the jurisdiction 
that govern a foreign limited liability partnership shall determine its internal affairs and the liability of partners for debts, 
obligations and liabilities of, or chargeable to, the foreign limited liability partnership."" N.Y. P'ship Law § 121-1502(l). Because 
CGL is a partnership organized under District [*16]  of Columbia law, the Court will apply District of Columbia law to those 
questions that concern partnership affairs. The Court will apply New York law as to Plaintiff's state-law contract and tort claims, 
however. In their motion papers, the parties have assumed that New York law applies, which is sufficient to resolve the choice of 
law question in favor of New York for these claims. See Krumme v. WestPoint Stevens Inc., 238 F.3d 133, 138 (2d Cir. 2000). "
1728,4," Even if the Court could exercise personal jurisdiction over these Flannery Defendants on an individual basis, Plaintiffs' claims 
against them fail for the same reasons they ultimately fail against Davidow. See Discussion, infra Part II. "
1729,5," In her Second Amended Complaint, Plaintiff asserts state-law contract claims (Counts One and Two) against CGL only. SAC 
34-35. In her opposition papers, however, she indicates that the Second Amended Complaint ""erroneously limits"" those counts 
to CGL, and that she intended to assert these claims against the Cuneo Defendants as well. Pl.'s Opp. 28. It is ultimately 
unnecessary for the Court to address this purported error, as District of Columbia partnership law bars Plaintiff from asserting 
either claim against the Cuneo Defendants individually, for the reasons explained below. "
1730,6," As noted in footnote 3, supra, the Court applies District of Columbia law to the [*25]  internal affairs of CGL, although, as the 
above citations make clear, the result would remain the same under New York law. "
1732,7," Whereas the existence of a fiduciary relationship between CGL partners is a matter of internal affairs and thus a question of 
District of Columbia law, the existence of a fiduciary relationship between employers and employees is a question of New York 
law. See Discussion infra n.3. "
1735,8," ""[C]ourts in this Circuit analyze discrimination claims brought under Title VII, [and] the New York Human Rights Law . . . in the 
same manner."" Tappe v. Alliance Capital Mgmt., L.P., 198 F. Supp. 2d 368, 372 (S.D.N.Y. 2001). Since a 2005 statutory 
revision, however, ""courts must analyze [New York City Human Rights Law] claims separately and independently from any 
federal and state law claims."" Mihalik v. Credit Agricole Cheuvreux N. Am., Inc., 715 F.3d 102, 109 (2d Cir. 2013). "
1741,1," We note here that there is some conflict between the record in the present case and the procedural history given in this Court's 
prior opinion addressing Dr. Kohn's earlier lawsuit against FirstHealth. As discussed infra, in Kohn v. FirstHealth of the 
Carolinas, Inc., 229 N.C. App. 19, 747 S.E.2d 395 (2013) (""Kohn I""), we rejected Dr. Kohn's argument that the trial court had 
erred in dismissing his claim that FirstHealth violated our State's public utility doctrine in denying his application for staff privilges. 
Our opinion in that case stated that FirstHealth ""did not accept [Dr. Kohn's 1999 application for staff privileges] because he 
lacked certification by the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology."" Id. at 20, 747 S.E.2d at 396. In the present case, 
although Dr. Kohn reiterates this claim, the only evidence in the record to support it is his own deposition testimony that after 
FirstHealth returned his 1999 application, an unidentified female employee in the hospital's medical staff office told him that the 
reason for his rejection was his lack of board certification. On the other hand, the record in this case does include a copy of the 3 
November 1999 letter [*5]  that FirstHealth sent Dr. Kohn which makes no reference whatsoever to board certification but 
instead explicitly states that his application was denied because his McMaster University residency was not accredited by the 
ACGME."
1741,2," According to FirstHealth's Medical Staff Services and Regulatory Director Jeanenne Watters, FirstHealth recognizes LCGME 
approval as the functional equivalent to ACGME approval, and thus ""[f]or physicians who completed residency training prior to 
1981 [when LCGME was renamed ACGME], our office confirms whether residency training was approved by the same body."" 
Watters conducted a review of every physician who completed their residency before 31 December 1981 and joined Moore 
Regional Hospital's medical staff after the ACGME requirement was adopted in 1995. Watters found that there were a total of "
1742,," seven such physicians, each of whom ""completed a residency training program approved by the ACGME, even if that was prior 
to the 1981 name change."" "
1747,3," We note that although Kohn I also involved claims by two of Dr. Kohn's patients who do not appear as parties in this case, for 
purposes of res judicata, ""[i]t is not necessary that precisely the same parties were plaintiffs and defendants in the two suits; 
provided the same subject in controversy, between two or more of the parties has been directly in issue in the former suit."" 
Green v. Dixon, 137 N.C. App. 305, 309, 528 S.E.2d 51, 55 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted), affirmed per curiam,

1751,2," The Court notes similar claims under sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act have been filed in federal district courts by 
independent pharmacies against various PBMs, including Medco, Caremark and ESI. See N. Jackson Pharmacy v. Express

2004). The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated these cases and transferred them to the Eastern District of 
Pennsylvania in 2006. See In re Pharm. Benefit Managers Antitrust Litig., 452 F. Supp. 2d 1352 (J.P.M.L. 2006)."
1751,3," The Donnelly Act, N.Y. Gen. Bus. L. § 340, is modeled on the Sherman Act and generally construed in accordance with federal 
precedent. See Menkes v. St. Lawrence Seaway Pilots' Ass'n, 269 Fed. Appx. 54, 55 n.3 (2d Cir. 2008) (citing cases). The Court 
will therefore evaluate HMC's claims under the Sherman Act and the Donnelly Act together. [*8] "

named in the complaint. (FAC at ¶¶ 16-18, 20) "
1759,5," ESI concedes ""the requisite elements"" of a tortious interference claim are ""substantively identical"" under Missouri, New York, 
and New Jersey Law (See Doc. No. 30 at 29, n.12). HMC does not waive its right to later move for application of New York or 
New Jersey law. (See Doc. No. 142 at 31 n. 24) "
1766,1," The discovery disputes presently before the Court arise out of the objections of Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs and End-Payor

1768,5," In their letter/brief, End-Payor Plaintiffs report that they ""have already produced their PBM contracts, which include the terms 
and conditions governing 'the role' of their PBMs,"" and further state that they will produce all documents responsive to 
defendants' RFP No. 23 which refer to Niaspan or niacin. (Pls.' Letter/Brief, Document No. 161, at 9.) To [*9]  the extent that a 
dispute remains about what PBM information End-Payor Plaintiffs possess, the Court directs that the parties meet and confer in 
an effort to reach agreement. "
1769,6," Rule 26(b)(2)(C) provides that: On motion or on its own, the court must limit the frequency or extent of discovery otherwise allowed by these rules or by 
local rule if it determines that: (i) the discovery sought is unreasonably cumulative or duplicative, or can be obtained from 
some other source that is more convenient, less burdensome, or less expensive; (ii) the party seeking discovery has had 
ample opportunity to obtain the information by discovery in the action; or (iii) the burden or expense of the proposed 
discovery outweighs its likely benefit, considering the needs of the case, the amount in controversy, the parties' resources, 
the importance of the issues at stake in the action, and the importance of the discovery in resolving the issues. "
1774,1," More specifically, the First Circuit reversed this court's dismissal of Evergreen's Sherman Act claim, and ordered that discovery 
be taken. The Court of Appeals also remanded a claim brought under the Massachusetts Unfair Trade Practices Act, Mass. 
Gen. Laws ch. 93A, for further consideration. This court dismissed the Chapter 93A claim on January 28, 2014 (Dkt #174)."
1774,2," Also before the court are motions filed by defendants to strike: (1) the report and testimony of plaintiff's expert, Francesca 
Scarito (Dkt #218); and (2) portions of the affidavit of Michael Forrest, certain exhibits, various deposition excerpts, and portions 
of Evergreen's statement of material facts (Dkt #248). These motions will be discussed where relevant in this memorandum."
1774,3," Three statements of undisputed material facts have been submitted by the parties. The first was filed jointly by defendants 
(DSOF, Dkt #239). The second [**4]  was filed by Evergreen and is not, strictly speaking, a response to the DSOF; rather, it 
states additional facts that Evergreen proffers as having a material bearing on the litigation (ESOF, Dkt #241). Finally, the 
defendants have filed a joint response to Evergreen's filing (RSOF, Dkt #250). The pertinent Local Rule provides that ""[m]aterial 
facts of record set forth in the statement required to be served by the moving party will be deemed for purposes of the motion to 
be admitted by opposing parties unless controverted by the statement required to be served by opposing parties."" D. Mass. L.R. 
56.1."
1774,4," Polystyrene is a polymer plastic formed from styrene, a liquefied hydrocarbon (petroleum). Often confused with Styrofoam, a 
Dow Chemical Company brand of insulation, polystyrene's principal commercial use is in the manufacture of food containers and 
protective [**5]  packaging. Because it is biodegradation resistant, it is an environmentally controversial packaging medium. 
""Green"" polystyrene is, in the industry's phrase, simply ""Post-Consumer Recycled Content."" It has the same chemical 
composition as polystyrene in its processed form and has no greater degradability. There is no formal industry or regulatory 
standard governing the percentage of recycled content a polystyrene product must contain to be labeled ""green."" "
1775,5," Defendants move to strike those portions of Forrest's affidavit that express an opinion as to the viability of Evergreen's 
business model, arguing that such statements are inadmissible as Forrest has not been qualified to offer an expert opinion on 
the polystyrene market. HN1[
] Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, a business owner is generally permitted to offer an opinion as to his business' value or its future profitability. [**7]  See Fed. R. Evid. 701 (advisory committee notes) (""[M]ost courts 
have permitted the owner or officer of a business to testify to the value or projected profits of the business, without the necessity 
of qualifying the witness as an accountant, appraiser, or similar expert."") (citing as an example, Lightning Lube, Inc. v. Witco 
Corp., 4 F.3d 1153 (3d Cir. 1993)). The admissibility of the opinion and the weight it is to be given are, however, separate 
issues."
1775,6," At the time he incorporated Evergreen, Forrest believed that it was only a matter of time until ""the market would require that PS 
[polystyrene] food service products contain recycled content or be banned from the marketplace."" Forrest Aff. ¶ 13. The only 
school system that came to require recycled content in food service products was BPS. Other school systems that considered 
the requirement rejected it because of the cost. See, e.g., Defs.' Ex. G at 39 (Coury Dep.)."
1775,7," Evergreen sold the trays to a distributor, Eastern Bag, which in turn sold them to BPS."
1775,8," Although Evergreen does not explicitly state why schools would be willing to pay this fee, the supposition is that the school 
would rebate the savings gained through lower drayage fees because of the diversion of some of the waste to Evergreen."
1775,9," In 2003, Evergreen attempted unsuccessfully to obtain a method patent for aspects of its business model. Defs.' Ex. 833 (Feb. 
3, 2005 Patent Application Publication No. US 2005/0027555 A1 (showing a provisional application date of July 30, 2003)). The 
patent was rejected for a final time in 2011. Defs.' Ex. A at 1734 (Forrest Dep.). Prior to the final rejection, Forrest kept the 
application [**9]  alive for purposes of this lawsuit. Defs.' Ex. 40 (July 11, 2011 e-mail from George McCormack to Forrest). "
1776,10," Scarito, Evergreen's expert, posited that Evergreen's resin could turn a profit at a price point of $0.60 per pound, assuming 
that the other contingencies were also met. Scarito Rep. at 3. The expert report does not take into account fluctuations in the 
world price of oil. (The price of polystyrene moves in tandem with the oil market, [**10]  that is, the lower the price of oil, the 
cheaper virgin resin is to manufacture). It is undisputed that Evergreen was never able to produce recycled resin at a price lower 
than $2.00 per pound. DSOF ¶ 35; Defs.' Ex. I at 384 (LoRe Dep.)."
1776,11," The BPS facility was owned and operated by BPS, with Evergreen having the exclusive right to purchase the recycled resin. 
The Georgia facility was the first recycling plant actually owned and operated by Evergreen. [**12]  DSOF ¶ 27."
1776,12," At about the same time, Evergreen obtained a commitment from Patterson for the purchase of $75,000 worth of Evergreen 
recycled resin at $0.45 per pound. DSOF ¶¶ 196-197; Defs.' Exs. 651 (July 13, 2005 e-mail from Forrest to Patterson) and 652 
(Aug. 9, 2005 e-mail from Patterson to Forrest). Dolco never actually received the resin. DSOF ¶ 198; Defs.' Ex. 653 (Evergreen 
invoices). "
1777,13," The proposal incorporated the most controversial aspect of Evergreen's business model, that is, Dolco offered to pay 
Evergreen a royalty for the use of its recycled resin. Forrest Aff. ¶ 23; DSOF ¶ 207; Defs.' Ex. 658 (Nov. 30, 2005 e-mail from 
Patterson to Forrest)."
1777,14," Patterson reported that Sysco had hit a ""bump in the road"" in unveiling an environmental line of polystyrene containers. 
Namely, Sysco had backed away from ""green activities"" because of a controversy about a misleading claim that it had made 
regarding the content of one its products. DSOF ¶ 213; Defs.' Ex. B at 105-107 (Patterson Dep.)."
1777,15," Before its demise, the Norcross facility also processed polystyrene waste collected from the Pasco County Schools, Florida, 
and occasional loads from the DeKalb County Schools, Rockdale Schools, and Newton County Schools, all in Georgia. DSOF ¶ 
31. The facility also processed some waste from Publix, a large, Southern-based grocery chain. Id."
1777,16," As with the aborted Dolco deal, the proposal included an agreement by Genpak to pay Evergreen a royalty for the use of 
Evergreen's recycled resin in the lunch trays. Pl.'s Ex. 1029 (January 17, 2007 e-mail exchange between Reilly and Forrest); 
Pl.'s Ex. 1036 (no date e-mail from Jeff [LNU] to Reilly and Tim O'Connor of Genpak)."
1777,17," Forrest alleges that Reilly's conduct was ""directly correlated to the March 6/7, 2007 group meeting,"" although he offers no 
particulars about the alleged meeting. Forrest Aff. ¶ 34. Evergreen's own exhibits indicate that the attempted bid retraction in fact 
occurred a month later in mid-April 2007. Pl.'s Ex. 1035 (April 16, 2007 e-mail chain between Forrest and unidentified individuals 
at Southeastern Paper Group)."
1777,18," The Evergreen/Genpak bid was identical in price to Pactiv's bid. DSOF ¶ 32; Defs.' Ex. G [**16]  at 235 (Coury Dep.). The 
Gwinnett Schools, however, refused to accede to Evergreen's demands that it require all trays purchased contain recycled 
content, and that it rebate any savings on waste haulage to Evergreen. DSOF ¶ 33; Pl.'s Ex. 906 at 445 (Coury Dep.). 
Ultimately, apart from BPS, none of the schools that Evergreen approached was willing to require that purchased trays contain 
recycled content. DSOF P 34 (citing refusals by the Atlanta Public Schools, Cobb County Public Schools, DeKalb County Public 
Schools, New York Public Schools and Orange County Public Schools). Similarly, Evergreen was unable to extract an 
environmental fee (one of its three essential revenue streams) from any school. Id.; Defs.' Ex. 39 (Aug. 1, 2009 e-mail from 
Scarito to Forrest). "
1778,19," Dart, for some reason, was not named to the Task Force. "
1779,20," None of the drivers are listed by name, nor are dates given when the alleged interviews took place, or whether anyone else 
was present."
1779,21," Demonstrating the value that Forrest placed on the royalty component of Evergreen's business model, he estimates that every 
$10 million in ""green"" sales would have resulted in $400,000 in royalty payments to Evergreen. Forrest Aff. ¶ 29. Pactiv, for its 
part, had told Forrest that, ""[g]iven [the] narrow margins on this product [school lunch trays],"" it would be ""unable to absorb any 
additional costs,"" which ""would have to be passed on [**24]  to the school district."" Defs.' Ex. 835 (May 28, 2008, e-mail from 
Terry Coyne of Pactiv to Forrest). Because of the narrow margins on lunch trays, neither Solo nor Dart manufactured them. 
DSOF ¶¶ 247 and 297. "
1780,22," Like Pactiv, Solo contends that it was unable to come to terms with Evergreen because it found Evergreen's proposed pricing 
""confusing,"" and that based on the price of Evergreen's resin alone, before any royalty or commission was paid, Solo would face 
a 5% increase in its production costs. DSOF ¶¶ 265, 270-274, 277 and 289."
1780,23," At least one member (Dart), recommended Evergreen to a client, Publix, when the grocery chain was seeking a polystyrene 
recycler. DSOF ¶ 332."
1780,24, The world price of oil dropped precipitously in the second half of 2008. DSOF ¶ 84.
1780,25," It will be recalled that Evergreen was never able to produce recycled resin at a cost of less than $2 per pound. See n.10, 
supra. "
1782,26," Defendants argue that a number of Evergreen's allegations fail on statute of limitations grounds. The Sherman Act has a four-
year statute of limitations. 15 U.S.C. § 15b. This limitation period begins to run ""when a defendant commits an act that injures a 
plaintiff's business,"" Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 401 U.S. 321, 338, 91 S. Ct. 795, 28 L. Ed. 2d 77 (1971), 
although ""each overt act that is part of the violation and that injures the plaintiff . . . starts the statutory period running again."" 
Klehr v. A.O. Smith Corp., 521 U.S. 179, 189, 117 S. Ct. 1984, 138 L. Ed. 2d 373 (1997) (internal quotation marks and citation 
removed). This becomes relevant only if a combination or conspiracy in fact formed in 2005. Because I find that there was no 
illegal combination, there is no need to determine whether later alleged overt acts may have retriggered the limitations period. "
1783,27," Evergreen focuses on the failure of its prospective business partners to agree to pay it a royalty or commission for the use of 
its recycled resin (the third essential revenue stream contemplated by its business model). As will become apparent, several of 
the defendants were willing to consider partnering with Evergreen, but not on the terms Evergreen demanded."
1783,28," For example, Forrest alleges in his affidavit that Sodexo told him that Pactiv and Dart refused its invitation to produce a green 
product line with Evergreen's resin in 2005. Forrest Aff. ¶ 17. There is no supporting evidence other than Forrest's say-so."
1783,29," Defendants argue that the notes should be stricken because they are explicitly labeled as a draft and contain multiple levels of 
hearsay. Def. Mem. Mot. to Strike at 6 and 12. Only one witness was asked about these notes at deposition, namely an 
executive of Dow Chemical (not a defendant) whose name appears on the notes as an attendee. He testified that he could not 
recall either having participated in [**37]  the conference call or having ever seen the notes themselves. DSOF ¶ 115. 
Defendants cite to Livingstone Flomeh-Mawutor v. Banknorth, N.A., 350 F. Supp. 2d 314 (D. Mass. 2014), where the court 
refused to consider a draft copy of a letter on summary judgment because it was ""not on letterhead, [was] unsigned and was not 
authenticated."" Id. at 320. Evergreen in response argues that the minutes are ""a party opponents' [sic] business record, 
produced by the ACC, containing its admissions regarding the core matters at issue and is not hearsay."" Opp'n to Mot. to Strike, 
at 8 (citing Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)). To establish the notes as the admission of an opposing party, Evergreen at a minimum 
would be required to authenticate them, which it has failed to do. See Carmona v. Toledo, 215 F.3d 124, 131 (1st Cir. 2000) 
(""The law is well-established that HN6[
] '[d]ocuments supporting or opposing summary judgment must be properly 
authenticated.'"") (citation omitted). In sum, the notes deserve little or no weight in the conspiracy calculus."
1783,30," Jim Lammers of Dart reportedly asked, ""[D]o we get a sense from our opponents that we can 'win out' without having to offer 
[polystyrene] foodservice recycling as an answer[?]."" Pl.'s Ex. 1025 at 1."
1783,31," It is true that one speaker suggested that support of a litter reduction campaign might defuse some of the public hostility 
towards polystyrene products, although it is something of a stretch to detect the stirrings of a conspiracy in this rather common-
sense recommendation. "
1784,32," Evergreen attempts to explain the collapse of the deal by pointing to statements made by Patterson immediately after the 
meeting between Evergreen, Patterson, and Sysco in November of 2005. Forrest Aff. ¶ 24 (Patterson ""said words to the effect 
'f****g McGrath [referring to the head of Dolco] stood up in front of these — the [Plastics Group] meeting . . . and he said that — 
that they're not going to recycle and that Dart got up right behind him and said 'We're not going to recycle either.' Patterson then 
said 'I am not going to compete with Pactiv. You understand that?'""). Defendants argue that this paragraph of Forrest's affidavit 
should be stricken because it involves multiple levels of hearsay and is contradicted by Forrest's prior testimony. Defs.' Mem. 
Mot. to Strike, at 4-8. Evergreen responds with the same argument it made with respect to the unauthenticated notes, that 
Patterson's statements are an admission by a party opponent and are offered not to prove that there was a meeting at which the 
statements were made, but rather to prove ""Patterson's [**40]  state of mind at the time about the unified action and fear of 
retribution."" Opp'n to Mot. to Strike, at 12. Patterson denies having ever heard such a statement. DSOF ¶ 112. That denial aside, 
Evergreen's explanation makes little evidentiary sense. In the first place, Patterson is not an employee with a senior enough 
position in Dolco's corporate hierarchy to bind his employer. Second, Evergreen's assertion that it is not relying on the 
statements for their truth is either nonsensical or disingenuous. If Evergreen is not attempting to use the statements to prove that 
a concerted decision was taken by the leaders of Dolco and Dart to oppose recycling, and that the alleged decision explains 
Patterson's reluctance to go forward with the Sysco deal, then there is no reason for them to be offered at all. Moreover, 
Patterson's state of mind is irrelevant to the question of whether the alleged combination or conspiracy actually existed. That 
aside, a statement by some unidentified person at Dolco that the company did not want to recycle or compete in Pactiv's sector 
of the market does not prove a conspiracy. HN7[
] The antitrust laws do not require a company to compete with other actors in 
its market. [**41]  A company is perfectly free under the antitrust laws to concentrate on its own chosen niche, leaving the 
broader market for others to exploit."
1784,33," In support of its assertion that Genpak attempted [**42]  to pull the bid, Evergreen points to an April 16, 2007 anonymous e-
mail that states: ""Michael has communicated that Jim Reilly retracted this price. Due to pressures from Kevin Kelly. We need 
discuss."" Pl.'s Ex. 1035 (April 16, 2007 e-mail chain between Forrest and unidentified individuals at Southeastern Paper Group). 
The sender and recipient of the e-mail are, however, unidentified. Moreover, as apparent from the reference to ""Michael,"" 
Forrest himself was the source of the allegation that Genpak had attempted to retract its bid. The email, in other words, proves 
little, if anything with respect to the existence of a conspiracy."
1784,34," Evergreen adds that yet another unidentified person at Pactiv made a ""nasty"" phone call to an official at the Gwinnett Schools 
saying that he would do ""whatever is necessary to get that bid back."" Pl.'s Ex. 911 at 61 (Laskowski Dep.). It is clear from the 
deposition testimony cited by Evergreen, however, that this conversation occurred in 2008 when Gwinnett Schools was soliciting 
bids on a new contract. Id. at 60. The court sees no connection between this later anonymous conversation and the 2007 
Genpak deal."
1784,35," Reilly, by contrast, testified that he made the suggestion [**43]  because he felt Genpak could not provide the depth of 
financial support that Evergreen required to remain economically viable. Defs.' Ex. K at 171-173 (Reilly Dep.). "
1785,36," Defendants note that, even assuming that this meeting of the Plastics Group culminated in a determination that Evergreen 
was not an attractive option for its members, as a matter of law, trade associations are free to ""evaluate competitors and make 
non-binding recommendations to their members,"" without violating the antitrust laws. Defs.' Joint Reply at 8. See Consol. Metal 
Prods., Inc. v. Am. Petroleum Inst., 846 F.2d 284 (5th Cir. 1988); Massachusetts Sch. of Law at Andover, Inc. v. Am. Bar Ass'n, 
937 F. Supp. 435 (E.D. Pa. 1996), aff'd, 107 F.3d 1026 (3d Cir. 1997)."
1785,37," There is some confusion in the briefing between the Plastics Group and the Task Force. Compare Opp'n at 24 with Opp'n at 
25. According to McGrath, the Task Force was created on May 31, 2007, during the conference call that considered Evergreen's 
proposals. Pl.'s Ex. 905 at 71-73 (McGrath Dep.). The Plastics Group had a broader membership than just polystyrene 
converters. Id. at 79. It was the Plastics Group that both considered Evergreen's proposals and formed the Task Force. Id. at 80. 
Evergreen's brief states that the Plastics Group, and not the Task Force, promoted PDR as a competitor. See, e.g., Opp'n at 25. 
This being said, Evergreen's Complaint limits the membership in the alleged conspiracy to the producer defendants that made 
up the Task Force (Pactiv, Solo, and Dolco), [**45]  plus one defendant that was not part of this smaller group (Dart) while 
excluding the fifth member of the Task Force (Dow Chemical)."
1785,38," The evidence cited by Evergreen confirms that the Plastic Group's deliberations were focused on a strategy for dealing with 
the threat of a polystyrene ban in California. Pl.'s Ex. 1013 (June 6, 2007 Levy memo) (Task Force was formed ""to help develop 
RFPs (requests for proposals) for qualified [**47]  bidders for a California [polystyrene] foodservice program"")."
1785,39," ""The members were then looking at being asked to fund a process that was really not commercial in its existing form and 
certainly not in the State of California, was being asked to evaluate that and commit — if I recall, the number was something like 
3.1 million, with an M, million dollars — to put this thing in and to hope that (a) it would come on line quickly, (b) it would work, (c) 
that would be the necessary resistance, if you will, where the rest of the State of California would say, okay, now there's this 
recycling plant here and that's going to solve all of the recycling woes in the State of California, so the judgment of the members 
was that that's not a viable option."" Pl.'s Ex. 905 at 74 (McGrath Dep.). McGrath later clarified that Evergreen's proposal was 
""[n]ot a viable solution for the State of California at the time [because] we were trying to reduce and discourage municipalities 
from banning polystyrene foam."" Id. at 81. "
1786,40," Kingsbury later confirmed that the Plastics Group ""was happy to identify more than one winner who could be pointed to as a 
viable recycler in efforts to lobby against municipal bans."" Def. Ex. C at 123-24 [**48]  (Kingsbury Dep.)."
1786,41," Evergreen does not identify the defendants or persons who participated [**49]  in the alleged campaign to promote PDR. 
Defendants maintain, and Evergreen does not deny, that neither Dolco nor Solo had any involvement with PDR. DSOF ¶¶ 244 
and 259."
1786,42," Evergreen points to PDR's limited success in New York as an example of a tangible benefit that PDR received from the 
backing of the Plastics Group. The agreement between PDR and the New York City public schools ultimately consisted of little 
more than a pilot project to establish the feasibility of PDR's proposed recycling program. DSOF ¶ 70. Moreover, the critical fact 
is that Evergreen was never in the competition for the New York contract because its business model was a nonstarter in New 
York (or California) for the simple reason that public schools in these states ""were not permitted to tie together their potential 
[Evergreen]-related savings on trash hauling contracts to justify paying more for [Evergreen] school lunch tray purchases, or to 
specify that they would only purchase recycled trays."" Id. ¶ 26."
1786,43," Both Evergreen and PDR were invited to make presentations to the Plastics Group, both were identified by the Group as 
recyclers that ""members should seek out to explore possible business opportunities,"" and both [**50]  were the subjects of 
complimentary articles in Plastics News. DSOF ¶¶ 362, 370-71, 392-393, 400-04, 411, 421-23. "
1787,44," Evergreen also cites for support two e-mails sent from Michael Forrest to Michael Levy and Larry [LNU] warning of ""red flags"" 
associated with PDR. Pl.'s Ex. 1037 (May 3, 2007 e-mail from Forrest to Larry [LNU] and June 3, 2007 e-mail from Forrest to 
Levy). This self-referential ""evidence"" is puzzling as it consists of nothing more than Forrest's opinion that PDR was not 
everything it was cracked up to be — hardly a surprising assessment by one competitor of another. Evergreen's own exhibits 
include an e-mail from Levy assessing PDR in April 2007 as being ""beyond the 'pilot' stage."" Although this e-mail indicates that 
PDR was still establishing itself as a business, nothing in it suggests that Levy believed it to be a ""sham,"" as Evergreen 
asserts. [**52]  Pl.'s Ex. 1006 (April 2007 e-mail chain between Mike Levy and Jane Adams)."
1787,45," Levy's initial assessment was the cautionary warning that if ""[the PDR] facility is not recycling [polystyrene] and is landfilling 
the trays, [the Plastics Group] will need to prepare for negative media . . . and work to minimize any industry damage."" Defs.' Ex. 
221 (June 18, 2007 memo to file from Levy). There is no evidence offered by Evergreen that the landfilling accusation was ever 
verified by Levy or by any independent source."
1787,46," Beyond failing to prove that defendants thought PDR was a sham, Evergreen has failed to offer any convincing evidence that 
PDR was in fact a sham. PDR had 18 employees at its peak operation. DSOF ¶ 58. It had investors, including a bank loan of 
$850,000. Id. ¶ 60. It rented an 11,000 square foot facility and owned the equipment needed to recycle polystyrene. Id. ¶ 68. 
PDR was producing 15,000 pounds per month by October of 2008, and it was of such a high quality that items containing 100% 
recycled resin could be made from it. Id. ¶¶ 81-82. In 2008, Evergreen by contrast had the equipment to produce no more than 
115 to 150 pounds of resin an hour, for a yearly production capacity of [**53]  under 300,000 pounds. Id. ¶ 36. Defendants 
contend that Evergreen's resin was repeatedly found inferior, including a high rate of impurities, id. ¶¶ 37 and 42-43; odor 
problems, id. ¶¶ 38 and 51; too much moisture, id. ¶ 39; high levels of bacterial contamination, id. ¶ 40; and melt flow ranges 
that often made it unusable. Id. ¶ 41. At the time Evergreen made its May 31, 2007 proposal to the Plastics Group, it ""had not 
even secured a location for a recycling facility in California, much less obtained permits and licenses or begun construction."" Id. 
¶ 119. Evergreen also has no answer to defendants' contention that Evergreen itself suggested that its resin be blended at a 
mixture of no more than 10% recycled resin to 90% virgin resin. Defendants question whether this is a sufficiently high content to 
justify making a ""green"" environmental claim about the final product. See, e.g., id. ¶¶ 199 and 262."
1787,47," The First Circuit found that at the motion to dismiss stage, this court ""improperly weighted defendants' alleged inconsistent 
responses to Evergreen when it weighed the parties' respective accounts regarding the plausibility of a conspiracy. In fact, 'there 
is nothing implausible about coconspirators' starting out in a disagreement as to how to deal conspiratorially with their common 
problem.'"" Evergreen, 720 F.3d at 51, quoting Anderson News, LLC v. Am. Media, Inc., 680 F.3d 162, 191 (2d Cir. 2012). The 
factual record now demonstrates that these inconsistent responses amounted to more than the defendants starting out in 
disagreement. Rather, the defendants' inconsistent responses to Evergreen permeated the entire period of the alleged "
1788,," conspiracy demonstrates that the alleged coconspirators failed to ever reach an agreement, assuming such an attempt was 
made."
1788,48," Although Dart, at its own request, tested Evergreen resin, it was never approached by Evergreen with any proposed deal and 
thus never entered into a discussion of a contract. DSOF ¶¶ 333, 335 and 337."
1788,49," It is worth noting that other companies that are not alleged to have been part of any conspiracy also rejected deals with 
Evergreen because the terms of its business model made no economic sense. See DSOF ¶ 49 (Dow Chemical), ¶ 50 (Ineos-
Nova, Darnel, Wincup), ¶ 51 (Cascades) and ¶ 52 (Wal-Mart)."
1788,50," Defendants further argue that Evergreen has also failed to prove that the alleged combination was ""in restraint of trade or 
commerce . . ."" 15 U.S.C. § 1. Antitrust claims ordinarily require a multi-part [**58]  showing: that the alleged agreement involved 
the exercise of power in a relevant economic market, that this exercise had anti-competitive consequences, and that these 
detriments outweighed any efficiencies or other economic benefits. This is the so-called ""Rule of Reason"" calculus. See, e.g., E. 
Food Servs. v. Pontifical Catholic Univ. Servs. Ass'n, 357 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2004); Fraser v. Major League Soccer, LLC, 284 "
1789,," F.3d 47, 59 (1st Cir. 2002). This calculus is bypassed if the collusive arrangement falls instead within one of several categories 
(e.g., naked horizontal price fixing) in which liability attaches without need for proof of power, intent or impact. E. Food Servs., 
357 F.3d at 4 & n.1. This is the so-called ""per se"" test. Evergreen alleges that it is a competitor with the four corporate 
defendants and attempts to shoehorn its claim into a ""category of agreements sometimes labeled per se, namely, concerted 
refusals to deal or group boycotts."" E. Food Servs., 357 F.3d at 4; see also Fashion Originators' Guild of Am., Inc. v. FTC, 312 
U.S. 457, 465-467, 61 S. Ct. 703, 85 L. Ed. 949, 32 F.T.C. 1856 (1941). The defendants argue that Evergreen was merely a 
supplier, not a competitor, and that this court's analysis must adhere to the ""Rule of Reason"" analysis. Because I find that there 
was no combination, there is no reason to decide the issue. "

1830,1," Plaintiffs asserted federal jurisdiction under the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 (""CAFA""). Pub. L. No. 109-2, 119 Stat. 4 
(codified in scattered sections of 28 U.S.C.). HN1[
] CAFA confers on district courts original jurisdiction where: (1) the amount 
in controversy exceeds $5,000,000, as aggregated across all individual claims; (2) there are minimally diverse parties; and (3) 
the class consists of at least 100 or more members. 28 U.S.C. § 1332(d)(2), (5)(B), (6); Standard Fire Ins. Co. v. Knowles, 133 
S. Ct. 1345, 1348, 185 L. Ed. 2d 439 (2013). HN2[

matter jurisdiction exists in the first instance."" Kaufman v. Allstate N.J. Ins. Co., 561 F.3d 144, 151 (3d Cir. 2009). HN3[

order to determine whether the CAFA jurisdictional requirements are satisfied, a court evaluates allegations in the complaint."" 
Judon v. Travelers Prop. Cas. Co. of Am., 773 F.3d 495, 500 (3d Cir. 2014). Plaintiffs contend that there were over 100 class 
members because there were ""tens of thousands"" of Class Vehicles sold in the United States. JA 107, 141-42, Second Am. 
Compl. ¶¶ 5, 127. As to the amount in controversy, Plaintiffs allege that class members ""suffered [**5]  economic damages 
including but not limited to costly repairs, loss of vehicle use, substantial loss in value and resale value of the vehicles, and other 
related damages,"" JA 148, ¶ 148, that they are seeking punitive damages and attorney's fees and costs, and that this exceeds 
$5,000,000. Finally, because one plaintiff and one defendant are citizens of different states, Plaintiffs contend that there is 
minimal diversity. Volvo answered that the jurisdictional allegations stated ""a legal conclusion to which no response [was] 
necessary,"" but to the extent ""a response is deemed required, Volvo admits the allegations in this paragraph."" JA 170, Am. 
Answer ¶ 5. HN4[
] Because Volvo did not contest these jurisdictional facts, we ask ""whether it is clear to a legal certainty that the plaintiff 
cannot recover the amount claimed."" Judon, 773 F.3d at 505. As in Frederico v. Home Depot, we have an idea of each class 
representative's damages but not the total number of class members. 507 F.3d 188, 199 (3d Cir. 2007). Using class 
representative Gregory Burns as an example, he was charged $252.82 to repair his damaged vehicle. As a citizen of New 
Jersey, he can seek punitive damages of up to five times the compensatory damages, N.J. Stat. Ann. § 2A:15-5.14(b). Thus, an 
estimate of his total [**6]  damages amounts to $1,516.92. A median recovery range for attorney's fees is approximately 30 
percent, which would be $455.08 for Burns' claim. Burns' damages plus attorney's fees would equal $1,972. The $5,000,000 
CAFA amount-in-controversy requirement divided by $1,972 equals approximately 2,536 class members. Because 2,536 is well 
under the number of Class Vehicles identified in the Second Amended Complaint (""tens of thousands""), we are satisfied that the 
""legal certainty test is met: as it does not appear to a legal certainty that [Plaintiffs] cannot recover the jurisdictional amount, the 
case need not be remanded and we may proceed to the substantive merits of this appeal."" See Frederico, 507 F.3d at 199. "
1832,2," The Supreme Court granted the petition for certiorari in Tyson Foods, Inc. v. Bouaphakeo, No. 14-1146, 135 S. Ct. 2806,

""Whether a class action may be certified [**10]  or 12 maintained under Rule 23(b)(3), or a collective action certified or 
maintained under the Fair Labor Standards Act, when the class contains hundreds of members who were not injured and have 
no legal right to any damages."" Pet. for Writ of Cert, Tyson Foods, Inc. v. Bouaphakeo, 2015 WL 1285369, at *i (Mar. 19, 2015). 
The Supreme Court may, therefore, answer this question during its October 2015 term. "
1833,3," The latest version of Newberg on Class Actions provides that ""[a] class action can be maintained by one class representative 
with proper standing,"" and cites to Rule 23(a) as authority. 2 William B. Rubenstein, Newberg on Class Actions § 2:8 (5th ed. 
2012); id. § 2:1 (""Once threshold individual standing by the class representative is met, a proper party to raise a particular issue 
is before the court; there is no further, separate 'class action standing' requirement.""); see also 5 Jerold S. Solovy et al., Moore's 
Federal Practice - Civil § 23.63 (3d ed. 1997) (""The named plaintiff in a class action must meet all the jurisdictional requirements 
to bring an individual suit asserting the same claims, including standing.""); 1 McLaughlin on Class Actions § 4:28 (11th 
ed. [**15]  2014) (""In the class action context, including cases seeking prospective injunctive relief, as an Article III justiciability 
matter only the named plaintiff must demonstrate standing to assert the claims (including injury in fact), not the absent class 
members. Individual class members do not need to submit evidence of personal standing."" (footnotes omitted))."
1833,4," Volvo also asks us to treat the certification of a settlement class in In re Prudential as distinguishable from that of a litigation 
class. Nothing in In re Prudential, however, limited its reach to that of absent settlement class members. See 148 F.3d at 306-
07. Nor has our application of In re Prudential been limited solely to settlement classes. See McCray v. Fidelity Nat'l Title Ins. 
Co., 682 F.3d 229, 243 & n.13 (3d Cir. 2012) (""In the context of class actions, Article III standing 'is determined vis-a-vis the 
named parties.'"" (quoting In re Prudential, 148 F.3d at 306)). Indeed, Rule 23's rigors are not relaxed as to a settlement class; 
we simply do not weigh issues of trial management as they are irrelevant in such a situation. Sullivan v. DB Investments, Inc. 
(Sullivan II), 667 F.3d 273, 303 (3d Cir. 2011) (en banc) (""[A] district court '[c]onfronted with a request for settlement-only class "
1834,," certification' need not inquire whether the case 'would present intractable management problems.'"" (second alteration in original) 
(quoting Amchem, 521 U.S. at 620)). Given that standing [**16]  is a threshold jurisdictional question, there is no reason to alter 
its application for a litigation class. "
1837,5," Similar reasoning has been used by our sister circuits that have also concluded that unnamed class members need not 
establish Article III standing. See, e.g., In re Nexium Antitrust Litig., 777 F.3d 9, 25, 30-31 (1st Cir. 2015) (concluding ""that the 
presence of a de minimis number of uninjured class members is permissible at class certification"" and would not defeat 
commonality or predominance); Stearns, 655 F.3d at 1020-21 (""'In a class action, standing is satisfied if at least one named 
plaintiff meets the requirements [of Article III]. . . . Thus, we consider only whether at least one named plaintiff satisfies the 
standing requirements.'"" (quoting Bates v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 511 F.3d 974, 985 (9th Cir. 2007) (en banc))); DG ex rel. 
Stricklin v. Devaughn, 594 F.3d 1188, 1198 (10th Cir. 2010) (""Rule 23's certification requirements neither require all class 
members to suffer harm or threat of immediate harm nor Named Plaintiffs to prove class members have suffered such harm.""); 
Mims v. Stewart Title Guar. Co., 590 F.3d 298, 308 (5th Cir. 2009) (""Class certification is not precluded simply because a class 
may include persons who have not been injured by the defendant's conduct.""). [**30] "
1838,6," Volvo's standing argument dispatches a profusion of class-action buzzwords including overbreadth, class definition, 
commonality, ascertainability, as well as citation to the injury-in-fact required to establish Article III standing, the Rules Enabling 
Act's dictate that federal rules may not ""abridge, enlarge or modify any substantive right,"" 28 U.S.C. § 2072(b), and a 
defendant's ""due process right to raise individual challenges and defenses to claims,"" Carrera, 727 F.3d at 307. Volvo Br. 34-41. 
At oral argument, it became apparent that Volvo was focused on the issue of standing. "
1841,7," The District Court also said the predominance requirement was ""readily met"" ""as discussed supra."" JA 83. The only relevant 
previous discussion was the District Court's evaluation of commonality. The District Court stated that the common questions 
included whether: (1) ""the sunroof drainage systems in the Class Vehicles are defective""; (2) ""Defendants knew of the defect but 
failed to disclose it to the Class""; and (3) ""the maintenance instructions were inadequate and/or uniformly deficient."" JA 78. 
Rejecting Volvo's commonality challenge, the District Court stated that the ""issue is whether the design of the sunroof drainage 
system was defective, not whether the existence of the alleged defect resulted in a clogged drain tube causing water to spill into 
the vehicle."" JA 79. The District Court's commonality analysis was of limited import for the question of predominance. We have previously noted that 
the Rule 23(b)(3) predominance requirement incorporates the Rule 23(a)(2) commonality requirement. [**41]  In re Warfarin 
Sodium Antitrust Litig., 391 F.3d 516, 528 (3d Cir. 2004). The inverse of this proposition, that the commonality requirement 
satisfies predominance, is not true because the ""predominance criterion is far more demanding."" Amchem, 521 U.S. at 624."
1841,8," Volvo also argues that even if Sullivan II applies to Plaintiffs' consumer fraud claims, the District Court ignored the 
predominance inquiry for the common law fraud, breach of implied warranty, breach of express warranty, and breach of the 
implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claims. For the reasons explained above, Sullivan II does not obviate the need for 
Plaintiffs to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the predominance requirement is satisfied. "
1842,9," In Marcus, a New Jersey class asserted four claims against BMW and Bridgestone relating to the NJCFA, breach of the implied 
warranty of merchantability, breach of contract, and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. 687 F.3d at 
600. Like the trial court, we analyzed Marcus's common law claims together and noted the shared elements between the claims. 
Id. at 600 & n.8. Despite concluding that Marcus supplied sufficient evidence to establish predominance as to a defect in the 
Bridgestone run-flat tires, we concluded that the individualized evidence required to prove proximate causation meant that the 
common law claims [**46]  could not be tried on a class-wide basis. Id. at 605. We explained that Marcus's damages allegations 
""beg the question of what caused class members' tires to go flat and need replacement."" Id. at 604. As to Marcus's claim under the NJCFA, we noted that the statute required a plaintiff to establish ascertainable loss. Id. at 605-
06. We explained that ""ascertainable loss"" based on ""the cost of replacing [a] tire"" could not meet the predominance requirement 
and went on to analyze loss based on ""the value of the product [a class member] expected to purchase minus the value of the 
product they actually purchased."" Id. at 606. We explained that under that theory of ""ascertainable loss,"" a court could not apply 
a ""presumption of causation"" without considering both ""the defendants' course of conduct . . . [and] also that of the plaintiffs."" Id. 
at 606-10. Specifically, we held that the district court needed to have found ""(1) that the alleged defects were not knowable to a 
significant number of potential class members before they purchased or leased their BMWs, or (2) that, even if the defects were 
knowable, that class members were nonetheless relatively uniform in their decisionmaking."" Id. at 611. We directed the district 
court to conduct [**47]  this analysis in the first instance. Id. "

33)); Wallace B. Roderick Revocable Living Trust v. XTO Energy, Inc., 725 F.3d 1213, 1220 (10th Cir. 2013) (vacating and 
remanding a district court's certification decision to more fully consider the predominance requirement, but noting that [**51]  
even after Comcast ""there are ways to preserve the class action model in the face of individualized damages""); Leyva v. Medline 
Indus. Inc., 716 F.3d 510, 514 (9th Cir. 2013) (interpreting Comcast as requiring that ""the plaintiffs must be able to show that 
their damages stemmed from the defendant's actions that created the legal liability"" and that rule is satisfied where ""damages 
will be calculated based on the wages each employee lost due to Medline's unlawful practices""). The D.C. Circuit has interpreted Comcast as requiring proof of class-wide damages in the context of an antitrust class, 
explaining: ""It is now indisputably the role of the district court to scrutinize the evidence before granting certification, even when 
doing so 'requires inquiry into the merits of the claim.'"" In re Rail Freight Fuel Surcharge Antitrust Litig., 725 F.3d at 253 (quoting 
Comcast, 133 S. Ct. at 1433). The Court went on to summarize that the specific proffered expert models were essential to the 
plaintiffs' evidence of class-wide injury, concluding ""[n]o damages model, no predominance, no class certification."" Id. One could 
read this analysis out of context as saying that all classes require a damages model; however, like Comcast, the analysis as to 
class-wide damages was specific to that antitrust claim. "

1847,3," Paragraph 17 of the Settlement Agreement, titled ""Prevailing Party,"" also contains an attorneys' fee provision: ""In the event a

this Agreement, and such dispute is arbitrated or litigated to a conclusion, the Party prevailing in such arbitration or litigation 
shall be entitled to recover from the losing Party its reasonable attorneys' fees, expert fees and costs."" (Settlement Agreement ¶
