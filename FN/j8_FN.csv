28,1," Unless otherwise stated, all statutory references herein are to the Business and Professions Code. "
29,2," Section 17043 makes it unlawful for ""for any person engaged in business within this State to sell any article or product at less 
than the cost thereof to such vendor, or to give away any article or product, for the purpose of injuring competitors or destroying 
competition."" (§ 17043.) Section 17044, in turn, makes it unlawful for ""any person engaged in business within this State to sell or use any article or 
product as a 'loss leader' as defined in Section 17030 of this chapter. (§ 17044.) A ""loss leader"" under the UPA means ""any article or product sold at less than cost: [¶] (a) Where the purpose is to induce, 
promote or encourage the purchase of other merchandise; or [¶] (b) Where the effect is a tendency or capacity to mislead or 
deceive purchasers or prospective purchasers; or [¶] (c) Where the effect is to divert trade from or otherwise injure competitors."" 
(§ 17030.)"
29,3," On May 7, 2012, the trial court granted Dixon's request for preliminary injunction, [*3]  thereby enjoining Safeway from setting 
the street price at its City of Dixon station at a level whereby, after deducting the three-cents-per-gallon discount for Safeway 
Club Card holders, the transaction price for fuel was below its total cost. At the same time, the trial court denied Dixon's request 
for preliminary injunction to enjoin Safeway from issuing fuel discounts under a separate rewards program the company offered 
grocery customers (discussed in greater detail herein). Following issuance of this preliminary injunction, Safeway discontinued 
its Club Card program. Subsequently, on September 25, 2012, Dixon filed a supplemental complaint adding allegations that 
Safeway's below-cost sales and use of loss leaders had continued since the initial complaint was filed."
29,4," Broadly speaking, target competitors were defined as those ""who could take the most volume away."" "
30,5," The term ""margin"" in this context refers to the difference between Safeway's ""rack"" price (i.e., the wholesale price Safeway paid 
for the fuel) and its street price (i.e., the price posted at Safeway's station). Safeway's fuel supplier during the relevant time 
period was Tesoro Refining and Marketing Company (Tesoro). [*6]  The price Safeway paid for this fuel was a matter of 
contract. The parties negotiated the formulas used to set daily fuel prices in order to safeguard against market uncertainty or 
turbulence. "
31,6," In December 2012, Safeway moved for summary adjudication of all four causes of action as applied to Safeway's grocery-
based fuel promotions based on certain of its affirmative defenses, as well as other legal grounds. The court partially granted 
this motion. Specifically, the court rejected Safeway's arguments for summary adjudication of the UCL claims, while agreeing as 
to the UPA claims that Dixon had failed to meet its burden of presenting evidence sufficient to create a triable issue as to 
Safeway's ""purpose"" in offering its grocery-based fuel promotions. Dixon then moved for reconsideration of this motion, and a 
hearing on the motion was scheduled for April 2013. Ultimately, however, after judgment was entered in favor of Safeway on all 
causes of action, Dixon's motion for reconsideration of the summary adjudication order became moot. "
34,7," Contrary to Dixon's contentions, the trial court did not misinterpret Cel-Tech ""to require federal predatory pricing rules,"" or fail to 
recognize that Cel-Tech permits a showing of ""unfairness"" to be tethered to California public policy without reference to federal 
law. Rather, the trial court expressly recognized in the statement of decision that federal antitrust is persuasive, but not 
controlling on California courts addressing UCL or UPA claims. (Cel-Tech, supra, 20 Cal.4th at p. 186, fn. 11.) The court also 
correctly noted that the Cel-Tech court itself looked to federal antitrust standards for guidance, rather than the UPA, to determine 
what sort of low pricing practices might meet the test for unfairness under the UCL. (See Cel-Tech, supra, 20 Cal.4th at pp. 189-
190.) However, given the absence of any evidence in this record demonstrating Safeway's pricing was unfairly low, as opposed 
to just simply low, the trial court had a valid legal basis for declining to inquire more deeply into what precisely a plaintiff must 
show to prevail on these claims. "
35,8," Safeway contends we should deem Dixon's evidentiary challenges forfeited based upon the company's failure to provide a fair 
and complete summary of the relevant facts. (See, e.g., Arechiga v. Dolores Press, Inc. (2011) 192 Cal.App.4th 567, 571, 121 
Cal. Rptr. 3d 654.) According to Safeway, Dixon's brief identifies only those facts favorable to its case in violation of well-
established rules of appellate procedure. We tend to agree with Safeway on this issue. Nonetheless, in recognition of the public 
policy favoring decisions reached on the merits, we proceed to Dixon's substantive arguments."
35,9," In finding that Safeway did not act with the purpose of inflicting injury, the trial court credited the testimony of several Safeway 
officers or employees, including S. Patel, G. Wood, J. Pettus, S. Olea, and A. Silver, as well as Safeway Exhibits 1121, 1123 
and 1125. Dixon presents no challenge to the admissibility or weight of this evidence."
35,10," Thus, while Dixon is correct that, under the UPA, ""[p]roof that a defendant sold or distributed articles or products below cost 
will be 'presumptive evidence of the purpose or intent to injure competitors or destroy competition' (§ 17071)"" (Pan Asia Venture 
Capital Corp. v. Hearst Corp. (1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 424, 432, 88 Cal. Rptr. 2d 118), in this case the trial court had a sufficient 
evidentiary basis for concluding that any such presumption had been successfully rebutted by Safeway. "
42,1," I will only discuss the opinions contained in Dr. Johnson and Dr. Lopez's reports insofar as they relate to the arguments 
advanced by the defendants in their motions to exclude Prof. Elhauge's testimony. "
43,2," I will conduct a more extensive review of defendants' Daubert challenge than might be applied in other contexts due to the 
extensive nature of the parties' Daubert briefs and expert reports, the multiple parties and sometimes overlapping expert 
opinions involved, the complexity of the econometric issues underlying the experts' opinions and the importance of the Daubert 
inquiry prior to deciding class certification. "
44,3, Prof. Elhauge's more general works on antitrust law have been cited by the Supreme Court as well. 
48,4," Prof. Elhauge opines that the relevant product market is fresh agaricus mushrooms and that those mushrooms are not 
interchangeable with cannery grade mushrooms. Elhauge Rpt. at ¶ 47. There is factual dispute regarding the proper definition of 
""fresh"" agaricus mushrooms and mushrooms that are ""cannery grade"" that influences whether the restriction of supply from 
mushroom farms that may have been selling to canneries affected fresh mushroom pricing. Cf. Daubert Hr'g Tr. (May 19, 2015) 
at [*35]  145:15-9:6 with Id. at 48:13-50:18. "
49,5," Prof. Elhauge does not dispute that sensitivity testing of regression models is theoretically possible, but contends that Dr. 
Johnson's modifications of his agnostic periods are not reasonable and therefore are not truly ""sensitivity"" tests. Elhauge Reply 
at ¶ 324. There may be other methods of testing the accuracy of benchmark periods that have not been put forward as 
criticisms [*39]  of Prof. Elhauge's analysis."
49,6," Prof. Elhauge contends that both assumptions to include conduct or conduct free periods in place of his agnostic periods are 
equally objectionable because they assume facts about anticompetitive conduct that are not sufficiently based in the record. See 
Elhauge Reply at ¶ 321. "
52,7," A dispute has evolved through the briefing of these motions about exactly what data was produced by defendants and 
considered by Elhauge. See e.g., Dkt. No. 561 at 4-5; 565 at 8-11. I find that Elhauge has considered enough sales data to 
make his analysis reliable."
52,8," Defendants even imply that Prof. Elhauge's sample needs to be randomized in [*52]  order to be considered reliable under 
Rule 702. See Dkt. No. 515 at 15, 18; Lopez Rpt. at ¶ 53 (stating Prof. Elhauge's model is flawed because ""it is, non—random 
and therefore not representative of the market""). It is important that ""[m]ost statistical analyses pertinent to judicial proceedings, 
and certainly those dealing with economic and antitrust issues, are not based on randomized controlled experiments. Rather 
they are observational studies grounded in real world data."" U.S. Info. Sys., Inc. v. Int'l Bhd. of Elec. Workers Local Union No: 3, 
AFL-CIO, 313 F. Supp. 2d 213, 233 (S.D.N.Y. 2004). "
53,9," Prof. Elhauge reiterated at the Daubert hearing that in antitrust economics one never has perfect information and that an expert 
must ""do the best with the data you actually have available."" Daubert Hr'g Tr. (May 19, 2015) at 54:14-55:9. "
57,10," Defendants argue that the standard of admissibility for damages experts making factual assumptions is stricter. First, 
defendants rely upon Elcock v. Kmart Corp., 233 F.3d 734, 756 (3d Cir. 2000), where the plaintiff's expert constructed a 
damages model to show the plaintiff's lost income due to disability. The Court of Appeals reasoned that the expert's opinion was 
inadmissible because [*68]  he (1) had simply assumed 100 percent. disability despite the record specifically identifying the level 
of disability at 75 percent or less, (2) completely ignored actual evidence of the plaintiff's income, (3) simply substituted his own 
income figures for income and (4) ignored the fact the plaintiff had continued earning income after becoming disabled. Id. at 755-
56. In contrast to the expert in Elcock, Prof. Elhauge does not rely upon factual assumptions that are blatantly contradicted by 
the record. For example, Prof. Elhauge assumes that defendants' deed restrictions prevented the closed mushroom farms from 
going back into production meaning he assumes the very purpose of the deed restrictions themselves. That is not ""pure 
speculation,"" but rather is a plausible inference within the context of defendants' alleged attempt to restrict mushroom supply 
through buying and deed restricting closed farms. ""[E]xperts are expected to make inferences and state opinions and they are 
granted wide latitude in determining what data is needed to reach a conclusion."" Brill, 540 F. Supp. 2d at 568. Second, defendants rely on In re TMI Litigation, 193 F.3d 613, 671 (3d Cir. 1999), where the Court of Appeals excluded an 
expert's opinion regarding radiation exposure in part because he had received [*69]  a critical piece of data needed ""to calculate 
the radiation exposure from Trial Plaintiffs' counsel"" and did not attempt to verify the data. But the Court of Appeals also 
reasoned that the expert was not qualified in radiation dose reconstruction, ""violated an elementary principle of credible dose 
reconstruction"" and that he could not justify his calculations after they were contradicted by another expert. Id. Prof. Elhauge's 
assumptions are also not analogous to the expert's errors in TMI, Prof. Elhauge reasonably relied upon record evidence 
produced by defendants regarding the market impact of their supply reduction program. In ZF Meritor, the Court of Appeals stated that ""[i]n some circumstances, an expert might be able to rely on the estimates of 
others in constructing a hypothetical reality, but to do so, the expert must explain why he relied on such estimates and must 
demonstrate why he believed the estimates were reliable."" 696 F.3d at 292. There, the plaintiff's expert had ""relied on a one—
page set of profit and volume projections"" to calculate damages that the plaintiff prepared and provided. Id. Here, Prof. Elhauge 
relies upon record evidence of defendants' own contemporaneous internal estimates [*70]  of the effectiveness of their supply 
control program. Where a factual issue is disputed and there are reasonable grounds for experts' contradicting assumptions, it is 
for the jury to weigh the parties' respective evidence regarding the amount of mushroom production removed from the market as 
a result of the defendants' supply control agreement in determining damages, It is sufficient under Rule 702 that Prof. Elhauge 
grounded his opinion on factual evidence in the record produced by defendants. Finally, defendants also contend that Total Containment, Inc. v. Dayco Products, Inc., No. 1997-6013, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
15838, 2001 WL 1167506, at *7 (E.D. Pa, Sept. 6, 2001) supports their position because there the Court excluded the plaintiff's 
expert's testimony based upon unconfirmed business projections by the plaintiff's own executive and where the executive could 
""provide[ no explanation of how he arrived at that crucial figure under accepted accounting of economics methods."" In Total 
Containment, however, the expert relied upon the executive's unconfirmed projections rather than the ""sales figures"" which 
""were presented to [the expert] in abundance, and [the expert] could have computed such a crucial figure on his own, [but] he 
did not."" Id. Defendants do not contend that Prof. Elhauge ignored undisputed mushroom farm production [*71]  data in favor of 
relying upon the EMMC's supply control impact estimations. "
58,11," Instead, defendants cite Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, 370 U.S. 294, 325, 82 S. Ct. 1502, 8 L. Ed. 2d 510 (1962), which 
found on appeal from a final judgment of antitrust liability that market boundaries can be determined by ""examining such 
practical indicia as industry or public recognition of the submarket as a separate economic entity, the product's peculiar 
characteristics and uses, unique production facilities, distinct customers, distinct prices, sensitivity to price changes, and "
59,," specialized vendors."" Defendants next cite to U.S. Horticultural Supply v. Scotts Co., 367 F. App'x 305, 311 (3d Cir. 2010), which 
found on summary judgment that a plaintiff had not carried its burden of showing the relevant product market. But far from 
mandating any special kind of analysis, the Court of Appeals simply noted that the plaintiff's evidence had failed ""to discuss price 
and use implications within its proposed market,"" that the expert report at issue did not even include information ""relating to price 
increases or price stability for substitute products"" 'or ""to provide any economic analysis of these substitutes."" Id. Finally 
defendants cite to Queen City Pizza, Inc. v. Domino's Pizza. Inc., 124 F.3d 430, 436 (3d Cir. 1997), which found that a 
plaintiff [*76]  had failed to plead the relevant product market under Rule 12(b)(6) because it did not even ""reference . . . 
reasonable interchangeability and cross—elasticity of demand . . . ."" In addition to the different procedural posture here, Prof. 
Elhauge's product market analysis is more complete he discusses practical indicia of market boundaries, functional 
interchangeability of the products at issue, price correlations and direct evidence of market power in the relevant market. "

96,11," In her article titled Why Summary Judgment is Unconstitutional, 93 Va. L. Rev. 139 (2007), Professor Suja Thomas [**54]  
perhaps goes too far, but not by much. Courts ought be especially wary of granting summary judgment upon the rationale ""no 
jury could possibly find..."" In all too many cases, this is a thinly disguised form of judicial factfinding, forbidden by the Constitution 
in a jury case. U.S. Const. amend. VII (""In Suits at common law . . . the right of trial by jury shall be preserved.""). Moreover, 
absent binding admission by the non-moving party, it ought be well-nigh impossible for a party bearing the burden of proof to 
obtain summary judgment. This is so because a court, while it must ""draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving 
party [at summary judgment], it may not make credibility determinations or weigh the evidence"" because such tasks ""'are jury 
functions, not those of a judge.'"" Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 151, 120 S. Ct. 2097, 147 L. Ed. 2d

many local rules adopting a point-counterpoint system which converts a failure to adduce affirmative contradictive evidence into 
an admission of the point advanced is simply contrary to Reeves when the moving party bears the burden of proof. United 
States v. Massachusetts, 781 F. Supp. 2d 1, 10 n.18 (D. Mass. 2011). This point is now widely recognized. E.g., Romag

contentious issues that may arise at trial. The problem is that they can delay the proceedings and beget still more such motions. Accordingly, I make it a practice rarely to entertain such motions pre-trial unless they clearly impact a party's opening or, as in 
the case of prior convictions under Fed. R. Evid. 609, they affect a criminal defendant's decision to testify. Trials are living things; 
motions in limine are best decided during the course of trial proceedings upon an actual evidentiary record. All too often pre-
trial [**62]  motions in limine arise from hopes or fears that have little relation to the practicalities of putting on or defending an 
actual case. As George Bernard Shaw said of second marriages, they are the ""triumph of hope over experience,"" or are simply 
expressions of the ""Jellicoe Syndrome"" - the fear of losing the war in an afternoon. So here. Many of these motions reflected the ""instinct for the capillaries,"" In re Relafen Antitrust Litig., 231 F.R.D. 52, 87 (D. 
Mass. 2005), were of little moment, and were unlikely to occur. The Court largely ignored them. "
100,21," The entire proceeding gives the lie to Judge Posner's sour and jaundiced view of our federal trial bar. See Reserve Hotels 
PTY Ltd. v. Mavrakis, No. 14-2990, 790 F.3d 738, 2015 U.S. App. LEXIS 10550, 2015 WL 3852645, at *6 (7th Cir. June 23, 
2015) (Posner, J., dissenting)."
100,22," The motion to enter final judgment in favor of the Defendants is in regard to ""(i) all counts of Plaintiffs' Complaints regarding 
any claims for an overarching conspiracy or agreement in restraint of trade among all Defendants, and (ii) all counts . . . arising 
from the settlement [**67]  agreement between AstraZeneca and Ranbaxy."" AstraZeneca & Ranbaxy Defs.' Mot. Entry Rule

101,23," Exhibit 140, Nexium Settlement Considerations, is, of course, a privileged [**70]  document within the ambit of the attorney-
client relationship. How then did it find its way in evidence? The Defendants at first proposed to have ""expert"" attorneys testify as 
to why these settlement agreements occurred. The Court would have none of it, ruling that no such ""expert"" could testify absent 
a full recitation of the actual factual bases of such opinion, Fed. R. Evid. 703, and perhaps not even then, since, in the absence 
of those who actually negotiated such settlements, such second-hand opinions probably would not be ""relevant to the task at 
hand."" Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharms., Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 597, 113 S. Ct. 2786, 125 L. Ed. 2d 469 (1993); Kumho Tire Co. v. 
Carmichael, 526 U.S. 137, 141, 119 S. Ct. 1167, 143 L. Ed. 2d 238 (1999) (same). Faced with the potential loss of evidence 
justifying the settlements, the Defendants raised no objection to the testimony of the negotiating attorneys themselves. This in 
turn waived the privilege as to a penumbra of documents used during the negotiations of the AstraZeneca-Ranbaxy Settlement 
Agreement. Nov. 10, 2014 Motion Tr. 10:10-11:16, ECF No. 1413. See also In re Keeper of Records (Grand Jury Subpoena 
Addressed to XYZ Corp.), 348 F.3d 16, 25 (1st Cir. 2003). AstraZeneca raised no privilege objection to the admission of Exhibit 
140. Nov. 10, 2014 Motion Tr. 10:10-11:16."
101,24, This is probably the closest judgment call the Court made during the course of this case. 
102,25," Many judges in this situation recount - after the verdict - that ""the jury saved me."" I try to eschew thinking along those lines 
when ruling on motions for directed verdict at the close of all the evidence lest the thought morph subtly into influencing the 
charge. The situation arises, of course, when the evidence strongly favors the defense. In those cases where the jury verdict is for the 
plaintiff, however, I strive mightily to sustain it, whatever my earlier impression. Here, the Plaintiffs' truly superb closing gave me 
reason to ponder."
102,26," The Class Plaintiffs agreed to dismiss their Section 2 claims under the Sherman Act, and their parallel state law 
monopolization claims, against all Defendants on October 14, 2014. See Stip. Regarding Certain Claims, ECF No. 1048 (End-
Payors dismiss Claims 1-3 and strike Section 2 from Claim 5). The Retailer Plaintiffs followed suit on October 17, 2014. See 
Stip. Regarding Section 2 Claims, ECF No. 1070 (Rite Aid and CVS); Notice Regarding Section 2 Claims, ECF No. 1074 
(Walgreen); Notice Regarding Section 2 Claims, ECF No. 1075 (Giant Eagle). "
103,27," Retailer Plaintiffs' complaints were left out of this table, as they essentially mirror the Direct Purchasers' complaint. The 
Retailer Plaintiffs, CVS, Rite Aid, Giant Eagle, and Walgreen Corp., are opt-outs from the Direct Purchaser Class and are 
assignees of individual Direct Purchasers."
103,28," Direct Purchasers dismissed all claims arising under Section 2 of the Sherman Act. Stip. Regarding Section 2 Claims, ECF 
No. 1047. "
104,29," Building upon the charge conference and the actual charge in this case, two of the lawyers for the End-Payor Plaintiffs in this 
case have prepared a very creditable proposal for suggested instructions in pay-for-delay antitrust cases. David F. Sorensen & 
Steve D. Shadowen, Model Jury Instructions: Trial by Actavis, 67 Rutgers U.L. Rev. 637 (2015). "
105,30," Of course, as has been explained, this Court's rulings on February 12, 2014 were, at least in part, wrong. The Court did not 
get things straightened out until midtrial. It is not at all clear, however, that reversal of the Court's summary judgment ruling 
would necessarily have followed. In the real world, the Plaintiffs - rebuffed at the summary judgment stage - might not have 
appealed, or even had they done so, had this Court not permitted them to supplement the record to demonstrate the genuine 
issue of fact, the Court of Appeals could well have affirmed despite this Court's imperfect understanding of the actual [**81]  
facts. "
106,31," Ironically, in both of these cases, my attempt to be fair and accurate only increased the litigants' cost and delay because I had 
botched issues more fundamental than the charge. In Suboh, I should have granted the defendant qualified immunity, Suboh v. 
Dist. Attorney's Office of Suffolk Dist., 298 F.3d 81, 95 (1st Cir. 2002), and in DiFiore, I should have recognized that federal law 
preempted the entire cause of action. DiFiore v. Am. Airlines, Inc., 646 F.3d 81, 90 (1st Cir. 2011)."
106,32," The Plaintiffs raise other objections and make other arguments as to why a new trial ought be granted. [**84]  These are all 
dealt with adequately in the trial record and further exegesis defending my approach will not be particularly helpful."
106,33," The Plaintiffs subsequently moved the Court to reconsider this ruling, offering FDA documents for the purpose of shedding 
light on the approval of another of Ranbaxy's ANDA generics, Lipitor. The Plaintiffs argued that the documents [**85] "
107,," demonstrated FDA concerns about the creation of a regulatory bottleneck in case of delayed approval, and demonstrated that 
the FDA would have accelerated approval of a generic Nexium ANDA in time for a launch earlier than May 27, 2014. The Court 
denied the motion to reconsider, holding that the documents were not sufficient evidence of any of the three proffered theories of 
causation. Id. at 279."
107,34," It ought be noted that the present theory of involuntary relinquishment differs from the one presented by the Plaintiffs in their 
pre-trial submissions that, had AztraZeneca and Ranbaxy agreed to an earlier entry date, then [**89]  the FDA would earlier 
have retroactively revoked Ranbaxy's tentative approval and determined that Ranbaxy forfeited its exclusivity. See Class Pls.' 
Opp'n [641] Ranbaxy's Statement Undisputed Facts Relating Causation ¶ 27 n. 41, ECF No. 791-1 (referring to the rebuttal 
report of Martha Bennett, at ¶ 45, stating ""For reasons explained below, it is my opinion that if the launch date for Ranbaxy's 
generic Nexium product was prior to May 2014 but after finalization of the Consent Decree on January 25, 2012, FDA would 
have implemented earlier dates for Ranbaxy to satisfy the pertinent regulatory milestones under the Decree or else face FTF 
[180-day exclusivity] relinquishment""). "
108,35," Oct. 30, 2014 Tr. 140:6-7, ECF No. 1399 (where the Court held ""[w]e're going up to May 27, 2014, that's what the issue is""); 
see also Oct. 31, 2014 Tr. 114:6-8, ECF No. 1401 (where the Court held ""let's go to [May 27, 2014]. I'm not counting more 
recent than that. But you can go to that date.""). "
110,36," It is true that Ranbaxy and Teva entered into strategic partnerships as to generic Lipitor [**96]  and generic Accupril. Yet for 
generic Accupril, Teva, and not Ranbaxy, voluntarily relinquished its first-filer exclusivity. See Deshmukh's testimony as to 
Accupril, Nov. 19, 2014 Tr. 52-55, ECF No. 1423. For Lipitor, since Teva had an earlier entry date than Ranbaxy resulting from a 
settlement agreement with the brand company of Lipitor, Pfizer, when Ranbaxy got the FDA approval, it entered into an 
agreement with Teva to ensure a timely launch of Lipitor. Again, this agreement did not involve Ranbaxy forfeiting its exclusivity. 
See Blume testimony as to Lipitor, November 20, 2014 Tr. 113:14-115:25, 117:14-16, ECF No. 1425."
110,37," Krishnan testified that Ranbaxy never considered doing a deal with Teva as to generic Nexium from 2006 to 2014. Tr. Dec. 1, 
2014, 8:1-16, ECF No. 1435. He also testified that Teva asked Ranbaxy for a meeting ""to discuss a potential deal regarding 
Nexium,"" but that Ranbaxy was ""not keen"" for it. Dec. 1, 2014 Tr. 10:13-11:25, ECF No. 1435; see also Oct. 31, 2014 Tr. 23:14-
20, ECF No. 1400. The absence of agreement as to generic Nexium between Teva and Ranbaxy was confirmed [**97]  by 
Blume, see Blume testimony, Nov. 20, 2014 Tr. 112:19-113:13, ECF No. 1425; Oct. 31, 2014 Tr. 24:8-10, ECF No. 1400."
110,38," Both Ranbaxy executives recognized that it is more valuable to get the first-filer exclusivity than voluntarily to relinquish 
exclusivity by entering into a partnership agreement with another generic company because generic companies put forth a great 
deal of effort to develop generics and put them into the marketplace. December 1, 2014 Tr. 8:10-9:7, ECF [**98]  No. 1435; 
Schober Decl. ¶ 11 (stating that ""180-day generic marketing exclusivity plays a vital role in ensuring that generic drug applicants 
like Ranbaxy continue to undertake the efforts and invest the resources necessary to develop generic drugs, challenge patents, 
and subject themselves to the risk of patent infringement litigation. Any action by FDA that decreases the certainty of receiving 
180-day exclusivity reduces the incentive for companies like Ranbaxy to undertake the risks associated with filing Paragraph IV 
certifications and invest the resources necessary to do so successfully."")."
110,39," Krishnan testified as follows: A. ""Voluntary relinquishment"" means that Ranbaxy, or the company that has the exclusivity, would give up the exclusivity to 
the public. That means just give it up. Q. Okay. Now, you said ""to the public,"" ""give it up to the public,"" could you explain to the jury what that means? A. That means that Ranbaxy would no longer hold exclusivity and it would be free for all the people who have filed the 
product and launched the product. So it would be not be specific exclusivity for anybody else, there would be a gate open for all the players in the 
marketplace. Dec. 1, 2014 [**99]  Tr. 12:20-13:6, ECF No. 1435. "

118,44," There is also an argument that no-AG clauses provide consideration to generic infringers that cannot be obtained by winning a 
patent infringement suit. If a generic defendant prevails in a patent infringement suit, it can immediately launch its product on the 
market under the determination that the brand's patent was invalid or non- infringed. One author argues that the prevailing 
generic would not have the power to prevent the entry of an AG during its launch, and that the value of a no-AG agreement can 
only be realized in a pay-for-delay settlement agreement. See Carrier, supra note 14 at 712-13."
118,45," This Court, too, instructed the jury at trial that ""you can't take care of the risk of the litigation by taking part of your monopoly

135,2," The DOC, however, still retained the ability to move the IANA contract to another organization. See Lepp, supra, at 959-60. 
The federal government plans to end its coordination role when the current IANA contract expires in September 2015, and has 
asked ICANN to develop a transition plan. See Nat'l Telecomms. & Info. Admin., NTIA Announces Intent to Transition Key 
Internet Domain Name Functions (Mar. 14, 2014), http://www.ntia.doc.gov/press-release/2014/ntia-announces-intent-transition-
key-internet-domain-name-functions ."
135,3," name.space's complaint only challenges the 2012 Round's rules and procedures. We therefore do not consider today any 
questions concerning the subsequent delegation of TLDs. "
136,4," ICANN had also moved to dismiss on the ground that the release clause in the 2000 application barred liability on all claims. 
The district court converted the motion into one for summary judgment, which it denied. ICANN does not seek review of that 
decision. "
137,5," Because the analysis under the Cartwright Act, Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code §§ 16700-16770, is identical to that under the Sherman 
Act, see Cnty. of Tuolumne v. Sonora Cmty. Hosp., 236 F.3d 1148, 1160 (9th Cir. 2001), we also affirm the district court's 
dismissal of the Cartwright Act claim. "
138,6, No claim for conspiracy to monopolize was raised in the complaint.
138,7," Contrary to name.space's argument, this case is not akin to Tate v. Pacific Gas & Electric Co., 230 F. Supp. 2d 1072 (N.D. Cal. 
2002). There, the relevant market was ""natural-gas technologies and/or the specialized equipment needed to supply the 
specialized fuels,"" which encompassed two distinct competing technologies—compressed natural gas (""CNG"") and liquefied 
natural gas (""LNG""). Id. at 1075-76. Although the defendant only sold CNG, the district court held it could be liable for hindering 
a LNG competitor based on allegations that it was protecting its CNG business and later planned to enter, and monopolize, the 
LNG market. Id. at 1078-79. Here, in contrast, ICANN does not need to hinder any of the relevant markets to protect [**16]  its 
own monopoly, and there are no allegations that it plans to enter any of them. "
139,8," Like the parties, we treat the three related claims collectively."
139,9," Because the complaint contains no allegations about delegations, we do not today consider whether an actual delegation 
would give rise to a justiciable controversy or the merits of such a controversy. See supra note 3. "
144,1," On April 10, 2014, the Court consolidated two related cases for pretrial purposes only: Thiel v. Riddell, Inc., et al., Civil No. 13-
7585 (JBS/JS), and Aronson v. Riddell Inc., et al., Civil No. 14-126 (JBS/JS). [Docket Item 16.] "
145,2," In their initial consolidated pleading, Plaintiffs specifically defined these three Riddell helmet models as the helmets at issue. 
The SAC identifies these helmets as among those at issue, but not exclusively so."
145,3," For comparative purposes, Plaintiffs specifically identify the following adult helmet models on the market: Riddell VSR-4; Xenith 
X2, X1, and Epic; Schutt ION 4D, Schutt DCT, and VTD, Air XP, Air XP Pro VTD, and DNA Pro; Rawlings Quantum [**5]  Plus, 
Impulse, and Tachyon. Plaintiffs also identify the following youth models: Xenith X2E; Schutt Recruit, XP, XP Hybrid, and 
Vengeance. "
146,4," Plaintiffs explain that absolute risk is the risk of developing a condition over time, whereas relative risk is used to compare risk 
as between two different groups. (Id. ¶ 68.)"
146,5," Plaintiffs note that some advertisements contained a more complete statement: ""[R]esearch has shown that players wearing 
the Riddell Revolution football helmet are 31% less likely to suffer a concussion than players wearing traditional football 
helmets."" (Id. ¶ 76.) Other advertisements referenced up to a 41% reduced risk of concussions. (Id.) "
147,6," The Court has examined the studies and reports cited in the SAC and upon which Plaintiffs' claims are based. See Miller v. 
Clinton Cnty., 544 F.3d 542, 550 (3d Cir. 2008) (""A court may consider an undisputedly authentic document that a defendant 
attaches as an exhibit to a motion to dismiss if the plaintiffs['] claims are based on the document."") (internal quotation and 
citation omitted); Gaul v. Bayer Healthcare LLC, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 188951, at *4 (D.N.J. June 19, 2013). [**12]  As noted in 
this Court's earlier opinion, The University of Wisconsin study compared the relative effectiveness of a particular brand of football helmet to reduce the 
incidence of concussions. 51% of the players in the study wore helmets by Riddell, compared with 30% by Schutt and 19% 
by Xenith. ""The most commonly worn helmet models by brand were the Riddell Revolution Speed (n=617), Schutt DNA 
Pro+ (n=420), and Xenith X1 (n=272)."" The study concluded that ""helmet brand, age, and recondition status were not 
associated with a lower risk of SRC in high school football players."" Notably, the University of Wisconsin study recognized 
its results in contrast to the UPMC study in 2006 which concluded that new Riddell Revolution helmets reduced the risk of 
concussions by 31% compared with traditional helmets. The University of Wisconsin study noted limitations in the UPMC 
study due to insufficient information regarding the age of the helmets in the control group and the exposure data for each 
player. In re Riddell Concussion Reduction Litig., 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4996, 2015 WL 224429, at *3 n.4 (internal citations omitted)."
147,7," The Court previously examined the Biokenetics report to Riddell dated November 15, 2000 and noted that it begins by stating, 
""Football helmets have proven to be exceptionally effective in the prevention of severe head injury."" In re Riddell Concussion 
Reduction Litig., 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4996, 2015 WL 224429, at *4 n.6. "
148,8," The Court also discussed the FTC investigation in its prior opinion: After investigating whether ""Riddell falsely represented from at least 2008 until early 2011 that research proves that 
Revolution varsity and youth football helmets reduce concussions and the risk of concussions by 31% as compared to other 
varsity and youth football helmets,"" the FTC concluded that the UPMC study did not prove that Riddell Revolution varsity 
football helmets reduced the risk of concussion by 31% compared with other varsity helmets. Moreover, the FTC noted that 
the UPMC study did [**14]  not test the effectiveness of Riddell youth football helmets in reducing concussions as 
compared to other youth helmets. The FTC emphasized two significant limitations in the UPMC study: (1) ""Revolution 
helmets were not randomly distributed across all of the participants in the study"" and (2) ""[p]layers in the control group who 
suffered concussions were younger than test group players who suffered concussions."" Nevertheless, the FTC decided in 
April, 2013 not to recommend enforcement action at that time because Riddell had abandoned its 31% reduction claim and 
a Virginia Tech study appeared to show that ""Revolution varsity helmets perform much better than Riddell's 'traditional' 
VSR-4 helmet in reducing concussion risks attributable to linear acceleration, one of the primary forces to which helmets 
are subject."" In re Riddell Concussion Reduction Litig., 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4996, 2015 WL 224429, at *4 n.7. "
149,9," Plaintiffs in the SAC are the same as those in the Amended Complaint with the addition of the Alliance Youth Sport 
Association, an entity that runs a youth football league. (SAC ¶ 114.)"
149,10," Plaintiffs' claims consist of the following: (1) violation of the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act; (2) violation of the Florida 
Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act; (3) violation of the ""Unfair"" Business Acts and Practices provision of the California 
Business and Professional Code; (4) violation of the ""Deceptive"" Acts and Practices provision of the California Business and 
Professional Code; (5) violation of the ""Unlawful"" Business Practices provision of the California Business and Professional Code; 
(6) violation of the Misleading Advertising provision of the California Business and Professional Code; (7) violation of the 
California Consumers Legal Remedies Act; (8) violation of the Arizona Consumer Fraud Act through misrepresentation; (9) 
violation of the Arizona Consumer Fraud Act [**18]  through omission; (10) unjust enrichment; (11) assumpsit and quasi-
contract; and (12) declaratory judgment."
149,11," Like the Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs' proposed class definition in the SAC suggests a nationwide class: ""All purchasers of 
Riddell Football Helmets promoted as containing concussion reduction technology within the United States from the beginning of 
the applicable statutes of limitation period through the present."" (Am. Compl. ¶ 117.) Plaintiffs, however, direct certain counts in 
the SAC to specific state subclasses."
149,12," The parties also filed supplemental submissions regarding litigation in the Southern District of West Virginia, Midwestern 
Midget Football Club Inc. v. Riddell, Inc., Civ. 15-00244, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 79036, 2015 WL 3797107, at *1 (S.D.W. Va. 
June 18, 2015), in which Riddell Inc. is alleged to have violated the West Virginia Consumer Credit and Protection Act based on 
the same or similar marketing statements at issue in the present action. 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 79036, [WL] at *3-5. The court 
issued an opinion on June 18, 2015 denying Riddell's motion to dismiss which raised many of the same arguments this Court 
now confronts. [**19]  2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 79036, [WL] at *5. However, the court subsequently vacated its opinion and 
requested supplemental briefing in light of the Fourth Circuit's decision in In re GNC Corp., 789 F.3d 505 (4th Cir. 2015). As 
such, this Court does not rely on the reasoning in Midwestern Midget. Nor is the GNC case, which considered the ""two different 
theories of recovery in a false advertising claim"" under the Lanham Act, binding in the instant action, in which Plaintiffs assert 
claims under various state consumer protection laws. Id. at 514. "
151,13," Although Plaintiffs do not quote verbatim the marketing language which they allegedly saw or heard prior to purchasing 
Defendants' helmets, Plaintiffs have adequately described and provided examples of this language. The Court is similarly 
unpersuaded by Defendants' argument that Plaintiffs have failed to identify the helmets to which Defendants' helmets are 
comparatively ineffective at reducing concussions. The Court is satisfied with the list of these comparator helmets provided in 
the SAC regardless of the fact that Plaintiffs do not precisely state when these helmets first came on the market. (SAC ¶ 11 n.1.) 
The SAC is clear that Plaintiffs' list consists of other helmets available on the market at the relevant times. "
152,14," For these same reasons, the Court finds that Plaintiffs' have adequately pleaded causation and reliance to satisfy Rule 
12(b)(6). The Court does not presume Plaintiffs' knowledge of the Schutt Sports litigation which appears to have predated the 
purchases at issue here. Nor will the Court be overly mechanistic in assessing Plaintiffs' allegations regarding causation and 
reliance. Defendants argue that Plaintiffs failed to specifically allege that ""they would not have purchased"" helmets if not for the 
alleged misrepresentations. (Def. Br. at 30.) Plaintiffs' allegations are clear enough that they relied on the alleged 
misrepresentations [**29]  in making the purchases at issue and they would not have done so had they not been exposed to 
Defendants' allegedly false or misleading statements prior to purchase. The Court's approach is consistent with many of the 
cases cited by Defendants. See Mickens v. Ford Motor Co., 900 F. Supp. 2d 427, 447 (D.N.J. 2012); Beaver v. Inkmart, LLC, 
Civ. 12-60028, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 125051, 2012 WL 3822264, at *4 (S.D. Fla. Sept. 4, 2012); Lorenzo v. Qualcomm Inc., 
603 F. Supp. 2d 1291, 1304 (S.D. Cal. 2009). Additionally, Plaintiffs need not identify the exact helmet they would have 
purchased had they not purchased a Riddell helmet. The brunt of Plaintiffs' allegations is that they paid a $50 price premium for 
Defendants' helmets based on representations that the helmets could reduce the incidence of concussions and therefore chose 
not to purchase less expensive helmets which were available at the time. Plaintiffs have provided a list of such helmets."
152,15," Smajlaj v. Campbell Soup Co., 782 F. Supp. 2d 84, 98 (D.N.J. 2011) (""[T]he gravamen of the claim in this case is that the 
consumer was improperly led to purchase a product because of a false or misleading claim on the part of the seller.""); Engel v. 
Novex Biotech LLC, Civ. 14-03457, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157281, 2014 WL 5794608, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 6, 2014) (""In an "
153,," action for false advertising under the UCL and CLRA, the plaintiff bears the burden of proving the defendant's advertising claim 
is false or misleading."") (quotation omitted); Kuehn v. Stanley, 208 Ariz. 124, 91 P.3d 346, 351 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2004) (""To 
succeed on a claim of consumer fraud, a plaintiff must show a [**31]  false promise or misrepresentation made in connection 
with the sale or advertisement of merchandise and consequent and proximate injury resulting from the promise. An injury occurs 
when a consumer relies, even unreasonably, on false or misrepresented information."") (citations omitted); In re Horizon Organic 
Milk Plus DHA Omega-3 Mktg. & Sales Practice Litig., 955 F. Supp. 2d 1311, 1331-32 (S.D. Fla. 2013) (""Although not 
specifically identified in the statute, there are three elements that are required to be alleged to establish a claim pursuant to the 
FDUTPA: (1) a deceptive act or unfair practice; (2) causation; and (3) actual damages. [D]eception occurs if there is a 
representation, omission, or practice that is likely to mislead the consumer acting reasonably in the circumstances, to the 
consumer's detriment."") (citations and quotations omitted). "
154,16," The FTC investigation, like the NAD report in Gaul, only questions the reliability of the UPMC study. It does not establish that 
Defendants' 31% reduction claims are false or misleading. After examining the methodology of the UPMC study, [**37]  the FTC 
concluded that the UPMC study did not prove that Riddell Revolution varsity football helmets reduced the risk of concussion by 
31% compared with other varsity helmets and noted that the UPMC study did not test the effectiveness of Riddell youth football 
helmets in reducing concussions as compared to other youth helmets. Accordingly, the Court's decision to distinguish between 
claims that accurately reported the results of the UPMC study from claims that applied those results to helmets not involved in 
the study is consistent with the FTC's investigation and findings. "
155,17," Unlike the Amended Complaint, the SAC is clear that Plaintiffs' claims are not based on the helmets' alleged inability to 
prevent concussions. [**41]  Plaintiffs, instead, assert a claim based on the relative ability (or inability) of Defendants' helmets to 
reduce concussions compared to other helmets on the market. For this reason, the Court questions the relevance of the 
Biokinetics report which Plaintiffs contend warns that no helmet can prevent concussions. "
156,18," The Court finds no need to address a letter stating that ""[g]round-breaking research shows that athletes who wear Riddell 
Revolution Youth helmets were 31% less likely to suffer a concussion than athletes who wore traditional football helmets."" (SAC 
¶ 78.) As Defendants correctly note, Plaintiffs do not allege that any of the plaintiffs received this letter. "
157,19," The Court also rejects Defendants' argument regarding ascertainable loss and injury under Arizona and California law. 
Defendants' argument in this regard is essentially a repeat of their argument regarding reliance and causation. They contend 
that Plaintiff Galvan does not allege that he would have purchased an alternative product and that the Arizona Plaintiffs 
continued to purchase Defendants' helmets from July, 2010 through March, 2013. (Def. Br. at 29.) However, the SAC does in 
fact allege that Galvan researched helmets from a variety of manufacturers and decided to purchase a Riddell Revolution helmet 
based on claims of superior concussion reduction technology. (SAC ¶ 111.) The Court sees no reason to require Plaintiffs to 
restate what is already clear: Galvan would have purchased a helmet from another [**47]  manufacturer had he not relied on 
Defendants' marketing statements regarding concussion reduction technology. As for the Arizona Plaintiffs, the Court rejects 
Defendants' contention that continued purchases of Defendants' helmets prevents as a matter of law a showing of injury-in-fact. 
HN5[
] Under the Arizona Consumer Fraud Act, ""An injury occurs when a consumer relies, even unreasonably, on false or 
misrepresented information."" Kuehn v. Stanley, 208 Ariz. 124, 91 P.3d 346, 351 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2004). That the Arizona Plaintiffs 
continued purchases may merely show that they relied on Defendants' alleged misrepresentations. It does not, on the face of the 
pleading, invalidate their alleged monetary injuries."
157,20," Defendants also challenge Plaintiff Kenny King's standing to assert a claim under the Arizona Consumer Fraud Act because 
the SAC alleges only that he made purchases on behalf of Alliance Youth. Plaintiffs do not allege that Mr. King purchased 
helmets in his individual capacity, that is, for his own use. HN7[
] ""[A] person who can violate the Act or be a victim under the 
Act includes 'any natural person or his legal representative, partnership, domestic or foreign corporation, any company, trust, 
business entity, or association, any agent, employee, salesman, partner, officer, director, member, stockholder, associate, 
or [**49]  trustee.' Waste Mfg. & Leasing Corp. v. Hambicki, 183 Ariz. 84, 900 P.2d 1220, 1223 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1995) (quoting 
A.R.S. § 44-1521.6). As such, Alliance Youth has standing to assert a claim under the Arizona Consumer Fraud Act. Kenny King 
has not alleged personal injury or any injury distinct from those suffered by Alliance Youth. See Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 
751, 104 S. Ct. 3315, 82 L. Ed. 2d 556 (1984) (""A plaintiff must allege personal injury fairly traceable to the defendant's allegedly 
unlawful conduct and likely to be redressed by the requested relief.""). Therefore, the Court will dismiss Kenny King from this 
action for lack of standing. "
158,21," Plaintiffs assert claims under the ""unfair,"" ""unlawful,"" and ""deceptive"" prongs of the California Unfair Competition Law (""UCL""), 
Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200, et seq., as well as claims under the False and Misleading Advertising Law (""FAL""), Cal. Bus. & 
Prof. Code § 17500, et seq. and the Consumer Legal Remedies Act (""CLRA""), Cal. Civ. Code § 1750, et seq. "
159,22," The Court will not distinguish between Plaintiffs' claims for unjust enrichment and assumpsit. See Stone v. White, 301 U.S. 
532, 534, 57 S. Ct. 851, 81 L. Ed. 1265, 1937-1 C.B. 224 (1937) (explaining that unjust enrichment ""is the lineal successor of the 
common count in indebitatus assumpsit for money had and received""); New York Pipeline Mech. Contractors, LLC v. Sabema 
Plumbing & Heating Co., Civ. 10-148 (SRC), 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8152, 2012 WL 209349, at *2 (D.N.J. Jan. 24, 2012) (""One 
cause of action for unjust enrichment at common law was the action in assumpsit for money had and received, which is 
equitable in spirit, although legal in form, and is maintainable when the defendant has received money which in equity and good 
conscience belongs to the plaintiff."") (quotations omitted). Indeed, as discussed herein, the Court finds Plaintiffs' equitable claims 
premised on the same alleged misconduct which provides the basis for their consumer fraud claims. Fundamentally, Plaintiffs' 
allegations sound in tort, not quasi-contract."
159,23," With the exception of Illinois, Plaintiffs do not argue that applicable state law conflicts with or materially varies from New 
Jersey law. Indeed, courts in this District have applied New Jersey law to unjust enrichment claims in the class action context. 
See Avram v. Samsung Electronics Am., Inc., Civ. 11-6973 (KM), 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 97341, 2013 WL 3654090, at *20 
(D.N.J. July 11, 2013) (""Unjust [**56]  enrichment is a shared feature of many states' common law. For unjust enrichment claims, 
many courts have found that there is no actual conflict between different states' laws.""). "
160,24," Defendants also accurately note that courts in this District have dismissed unjust enrichment claims where plaintiffs purchased 
the products at issue from a third-party and not directly from the manufacturer-defendant. See Avram v. Samsung Electronics 
Am., Inc., Civ. 11-6973 (KM), 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 97341, 2013 WL 3654090, at *21 (D.N.J. July 11, 2013) (""When consumers 
purchase a product from a third party, they confer a benefit on that third party, not on the manufacturer.""). This provides an 
additional reason to dismiss claims for unjust enrichment asserted by Plaintiffs who have not alleged that they purchased the 
helmets at issue directly from Riddell."
160,25," As Plaintiffs properly note, this is no longer a case where Plaintiffs allegations of consumer fraud are insufficient to state a 
claim. The present action is thus distinct from Ass'n Ben. Servs., Inc. v. Caremark RX, Inc., 493 F.3d 841 (7th Cir. 2007). See Id. 
at 855 (""[W]e merely conclude that, when the plaintiff's particular theory of unjust enrichment is based on alleged fraudulent 
dealings and we reject the plaintiff's claims that those dealings, indeed, [**58]  were fraudulent, the theory of unjust enrichment 
that the plaintiff has pursued is no longer viable.""). "
193,1," We emphasize that the allegations against defendants are nothing more than allegations. Even where we omit to use a word 
such as ""alleged"" in reference to claims against defendants, nothing in this opinion should be taken as a finding that any 
defendant manipulated LIBOR, that any defendant committed any other form of wrongdoing, or that any plaintiff suffered injury."

194,3," Although this is a new holding, it is not an entirely new concept. As we wrote in LIBOR I, plaintiffs' theory ""that defendants 
competed normally in the interbank loan market and then agreed to lie about the interest rates they were paying in that market . . 
. is [a theory] of misrepresentation, and possibly of fraud, but not of failure to compete."" 935 F. Supp. 2d at 689 (emphasis 
added). "
195,4," At this stage, there remains some uncertainty regarding which affiliates of some banks were official members of the LIBOR 
panel. Each defendant presumably knows which of its corporate entities prepared and submitted quotes, and we expect this 
question to be answered definitively in discovery, preferably through a stipulation."
195,5," Throughout this opinion, we utilize some jargon related to swaps. A trader who agrees to pay a fixed rate and receive a floating 
rate is said to have traded a ""pay-fixed"" swap, and would be injured by artificial suppression of the swap's floating interest rate. 
The most common documentation underlying swaps is an ""ISDA agreement,"" published by the International Swaps and 
Derivatives Association. "
196,6," Auction-rate securities are a new entry in the field of securities litigated in this MDL. As explained in part by the City of 
Houston's amended complaint, ¶ 395, the issuer of an auction-rate security was required to pay a floating rate depending on the 
result of a weekly auction. In early 2008, the auctions began to fail, meaning that the bondholders were unable [*100]  to sell 
their bonds at auction. As a result, the issuer was contractually obligated to pay the bondholders according to a ""fail rate 
formula"" that incorporated LIBOR. Effectively, the auction-rate securities at issue became ordinary LIBOR-based floating-rate 
bonds after early 2008."
196,7, A basis point is 0.01%.

197,9," Société Générale, which replaced HBOS on the USD LIBOR panel in early 2009 maintains that plaintiffs have failed to plead 
plausible allegations that Société Générale participated in persistent suppression. We disagree. At least one complaint, cited in 
plaintiffs' briefing, shows that Société Générale's LIBOR submissions were as much as 60 basis points below the Federal 
Reserve's Eurodollar index, which plaintiffs plausibly maintain to be a good proxy for ""true LIBOR."" See Philadelphia Compl.,

201,21," It appears that BATA, like many municipal plaintiffs, traded LIBOR-based swaps as a hedge. If these swaps hedged LIBOR-

209,36," Relying on Recurrent Capital Bridge Fund I, LLC v. ISR Sys. & Sensors Corp., defendants argue that ""[i]f a defendant rebuts

plaintiffs do not counter that evidence—the allegation may be deemed refuted."" 875 F. Supp. 2d 297, 304 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) 
(internal quotation marks omitted). Whatever the virtues of that rule, the Second Circuit has squarely repudiated it. See 
Dorchester Fin., 722 F.3d at 86 & n.4. "
210,37," Plaintiffs devote a substantial portion of their brief to discussion of how state and federal courts in the various states in which 
they have filed their complaints have interpreted the requirements of personal jurisdiction. But because defendants do not rely 
on state long-arm statutes and we must follow Second Circuit law as to federal issues, citation of such authorities is mostly 
irrelevant or repetitious. However, we do not anticipate that our present jurisdictional conclusions would be different under 
precedents of other circuits. Certainly, plaintiffs' brief fails to identify material distinctions in the law of the relevant federal 
circuits."
210,38," The Manual for Complex Litigation, Fourth (2004) suggests that an MDL plaintiff might avoid Lexecon by ""fil[ing] an amended 
complaint asserting venue in the transferee district,"" id. § 20.132, at 224. However, the Manual does not cite authority for such a 
procedure, nor does it appear to argue that it would be proper at a plaintiff's [*144]  unilateral instance. See id. at 224 n.668 
(stating that if an amended complaint alleges venue in the transferee district, ""the court and parties should take care to ensure a 
common understanding of the document's intent and significance""). Of course, a plaintiff may file a new complaint in a new 
forum, as the NCUA has already done, but the new complaint will not necessarily relate back to the original complaint for 
limitations purposes. "
211,39," Defendants challenge the constitutional viability of the national contacts approach, citing Daimler, Walden, and Porina v. 
Marward Shipping Co., 521 F.3d 122 (2d Cir. 2008). As defendants acknowledge, Porina applied rather than rejected national 
contacts analysis. See Porina, 521 F.3d at 127. And neither Daimler nor Walden involved a federal statute containing a 
nationwide service provision. See Walden, 134 S. Ct. at 1121; Daimler, 134 S. Ct. at 753. Nothing in these decisions so much as 
hints that the national contacts rule might be unconstitutional where it is supported by a federal statute."
211,40," The Second Circuit also recognizes a version of pendent personal jurisdiction under which a federal court may ""entertain 
[state-law] claims that are not expressly covered by the long-arm statute, so long as they derive from the same nucleus of 
operative fact as claims that are."" Hanly v. Powell Goldstein, L.L.P., 290 F. App'x 435, 438 (2d Cir. 2008) (summary order); see 
Hargrave v. Oki Nursery, Inc., 646 F.2d 716 (2d Cir. 1980). This judge-made exception to the general rule that a federal court 
must ""look to the law of the forum state to determine whether personal jurisdiction must lie,"" Licci II, 732 F.3d at 168; see Fed. R. 
Civ. P. 4(k)(1)(A), has no direct bearing to the present motions, in which defendants do not rely on the limitations of any state's 
long-arm statute. To the extent that plaintiffs suggest that this doctrine [*147]  would permit a federal court to exercise personal 
jurisdiction over pendent or otherwise ""supplemental"" claims unrelated to defendants' contacts with the forum state in the 
absence of a federal statute or rule authorizing such jurisdiction, we reject the suggestion as beyond the scope of Hargrave and 
unsupported by authority. Cf. Arrowsmith, 320 F.2d at 227 (""[N]either the federal legislature nor the federal rule-makers have 
had any intention to displace state statutes as to the taking of jurisdiction over foreign corporations in ordinary diversity cases.""). "
212,41," But see Nicholas v. Saul Stone & Co., 224 F.3d 179, 185 (3d Cir. 2000) (holding that 7 U.S.C. § 25(c) is ""a venue provision, 
not a jurisdictional one""). We do not find the Third Circuit's reasoning persuasive because the service provision of the CEA 
substantially tracks that of the Securities Exchange Act, which the Second Circuit has interpreted to express Congress's intent to 
extend personal jurisdiction to the outer limit of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Compare 15 U.S.C. § 78aa(a) 
(Securities Exchange Act), with 7 U.S.C. § 25(c); see Amaranth, 587 F. Supp. 2d at 526 & n.70 (citing Leasco, 468 F.2d at

213,42," Although we reject plaintiffs' arguments concerning the moving defendants, we have no reason to doubt that we would have

214,43," Plaintiffs rely on In re Hellas Telecommunications (Luxembourg) II SCA, 524 B.R. 488 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 2015), which held that 
Deutsche Bank's United States assets and operations were sufficiently ""substantial"" and ""long-term"" as to render it ""at home"" in 
the United States under Daimler. Id. at 507-08. In light of the recent leading Supreme Court and Second Circuit cases, we 
cannot agree with the bankruptcy court's conclusion that even very substantial corporate operations (regardless of whether 
measured in money, personnel, space, or [*155]  time) in a given forum suffice to make a defendant at home in the forum. See 
Daimler, 134 S. Ct. at 762 n.20 (""[T]he general jurisdiction inquiry does not focus solely on the magnitude of the defendant's in-
state contacts."" (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted))."
214,44," For more recent discussions of the competing approaches of federal and state courts, see Tamburo v. Dworkin, 601 F.3d 693,

bound to follow Second Circuit precedent as to issues of federal law, even though some cases may ultimately be remanded to 
courts in other circuits."
215,45," Thus, the Second Circuit recently characterized as ""dicta"" the discussion in Chew ""that the 'relatedness' test under the Due 
Process Clause may require proof of either but-for or proximate causation."" Licci ex rel. Licci v. Lebanese Canadian Bank, SAL 
(Licci I), 673 F.3d 50, 71 (2d Cir. 2012)."
215,46," See Licci II, 732 F.3d at 171 (finding jurisdiction in New York on the basis of the defendant's use of a correspondent account in 
New York ""as an instrument for accomplishing the alleged wrongs for which the plaintiffs seek redress""); Chloe v. Queen Bee of 
Beverly Hills, LLC, 616 F.3d 158, 166-67 (2d Cir. 2010) (finding jurisdiction in New York on the basis of an ""act of an out-of-state 
defendant employee shipping an item into New York"" plus other, related, contacts); Bank Brussels Lambert, 305 F.3d at 128 
(finding jurisdiction in New York over a claim that a law firm had engaged in malpractice in connection with a New York

at 30 (finding jurisdiction in Rhode Island for claim of wrongful death at sea where decedent had been recruited to the ship's 
crew in Rhode Island)."
215,47," Plaintiffs appear to acknowledge that a ""but for"" relationship between the claim and the defendant's forum-related contacts is a 
minimum requirement of due process in the context of specific personal jurisdiction. See Pls.' PJ Mem. 43, 53 (relying on AirWair 
Int'l Ltd. v. Schultz, No. 5:13-cv-01190-LHK, 73 F. Supp. 3d 1225, ___, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 159415, at *25-26, 2014 WL 
5871580, at *8 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 12, 2014), and Breathwit Marine Contractors, Ltd. v. Deloach Marine Servs., LLC, 994 F. Supp. 
2d 845, 852-53 (S.D. Tex. 2014)). "
216,48," Because we find no factual support for the conspiracy theory of personal jurisdiction, we need not address defendants' general 
legal challenges to it, including defendants' argument that it is inconsistent with the Supreme Court's statement that personal 
jurisdiction ""must arise out of contacts that the 'defendant himself' creates with the forum State."" Walden, 134 S. Ct. at 1122 
(quoting Burger King, 471 U.S. at 475) (emphasis in Burger King). "
217,49," As noted above, we may dismiss claims on the merits when multiple defendants, some of which are subject to the Court's 
personal jurisdiction, challenge the sufficiency of allegations on the same grounds and we find such challenge meritorious. See 
Chevron, 667 F.3d at 246 n.17. Thus, it is unnecessary for us to engage in an intricate and fact-bound analysis, as to each 
defendant, of whether its ""marketing"" activities in a given state rose to a jurisdictionally sufficient level."
217,50," As discussed above, specific personal jurisdiction requires, at a minimum, a ""but for"" relationship between the claim and the 
defendant's forum-related [*166]  contacts. The presence of ""marketing"" contacts may bolster an argument for specific personal 
jurisdiction on the basis of a claim arising out of a defendant's forum-related contacts, but cannot create specific personal 
jurisdiction over a claim that is wholly unrelated to the forum. Cf. Bank Brussels Lambert, 305 F.3d at 128 (holding that law firm's 
marketing efforts in New York supported finding personal jurisdiction over a claim arising out of the firm's New York-directed 
engagement). "
218,51," The NCUA brought suit in Kansas on the basis, in part, of swap agreements entered into with U.S. Central (a Kansas credit 
union) and four [*169]  non-Kansas credit unions. See NCUA Am. Compl. ¶¶ 6-10, 236-293. To be clear, the principles 
described herein do not support the exercise of specific personal jurisdiction in Kansas over contractual or other claims having 
no connection to Kansas. Plaintiffs' brief argues that defendants ""engaged with U.S. Central . . . to execute many of their LIBOR-
based transactions with other credit unions across the country, including the [four other] Credit Unions at issue in the NCUA 
Complaint"" and also that ""each Credit Union routed [trades] through U.S. Central."" Pls.' PJ Mem. 44. However, because plaintiffs 
cite nothing in the complaint or declarations that specifically supports these assertions, we disregard them. "
219,52," See, e.g., Decl. of Patrick Gonsalves, at ¶ 16, ECF No. 759 (Barclays LIBOR submissions were determined in and transmitted 
from London); Decl. of Kevin P. McKendry, at ¶ 9, [*171]  ECF No. 781 (Lloyds submissions were made in London); Decl. of 
Osamu Takashima, at ¶ 6, ECF No. 782 (Norinchukin submissions were made from England); Decl. of William Gougherty, at ¶

(Société Générale submissions were determined in Paris and transmitted from London); Decl. of Frank Borstelmann, at ¶ 10, 
ECF No. 786 (Portigon submissions were made in London)."
219,53," The parties disagree as to whether the New York contacts of nonparty Thomson Reuters, which is alleged to have been the 
BBA's agent for the purposes of calculating and distributing LIBOR, are jurisdictionally significant. It suffices simply to say that 
the allegation that Thomson Reuters ""is headquartered in New York,"" Kaas Decl. ¶ 21, has no bearing on whether defendants 
are subject to personal jurisdiction in New York or elsewhere."
219,54," The well-reasoned opinion in 7 West 57th Street Realty Co. v. CitiGroup, Inc., No. 13 Civ. 981 (PGG), 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
44031, 2015 WL 1514539 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 31, 2015), is not to the contrary. There, the plaintiff failed to connect their allegations 
that New York-based traders had engaged in LIBOR-related misconduct to plaintiff's claim. See 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44031, at 
*36, 2015 WL 1514539, at *10 (""Plaintiff has not pled facts suggesting that the conduct of the two Barclays employees has any 
connection with the injury suffered by [the plaintiff], or that the misconduct alluded to in the article took place within the relevant 
time period . . . .""). In other words, the plaintiff's claims against Barclays did [*173]  not arise out of its New York conduct. We 
agree that allegations of some misconduct in New York do not support personal jurisdiction as to unrelated claims. In particular, 
we do not suggest that allegations concerning trader-based misconduct in New York would support personal jurisdiction in New 
York for persistent suppression claims."
219,55," This distinguishes the present cases from the typical commodities or securities [*174]  manipulation case, in which defendant's 
conduct is intended to affect the prices of commodities or securities listed in, for example, New York or Chicago. See, e.g., 
CFTC v. Amaranth Advisors, L.L.C., 554 F. Supp. 2d 523, 530 (S.D.N.Y. 2008); In re Natural Gas Commodity Litig., 337 F. 
Supp. 2d 498, 517 (S.D.N.Y. 2004). "
220,56," This clause is standard in the 1992 version of the ISDA Master Agreement. See Paul C. Harding, Mastering the ISDA Master 
Agreements (1992 and 2002) 126-27 (3d ed. 2010). Although the parties have not called it to our attention, the revised 2002 
version of the Master Agreement contains the language ""relating to any dispute arising out of or in connection with this 
Agreement."" Id. at 312. To the extent that any of the Master Agreements in this case follow the 2002 version, our conclusion is 
unchanged. "
221,57," Use of the phrase ""relating to this Agreement"" distinguishes Arma v. Buyseasons, Inc., 591 F. Supp. 2d 637, 645 (S.D.N.Y. 
2008), in which the forum selection clause used the narrower language ""arising under this Agreement."" Cf. Phillips, 494 F.3d at 
389 (concluding that scope of ""arise out of"" is narrower than scope of ""relate to"")."
221,58," This conclusion is bolstered by the Second Circuit's discussion of the 1992 ISDA Master Agreement in Finance One Public 
Co. v. Lehman Bros. Special Financing, Inc., 414 F.3d 325 (2d Cir. 2005). There, the Second Circuit interpreted the Master 
Agreement's choice of law clause narrowly, but observed that ""[t]he forum-selection clause in the Master Agreement is 
admittedly broader than the choice-of-law clause"" and that the forum selection clause ""ha[d] been given its full effect"" when a 
""claim of an extra-contractual setoff right[ was] heard in the contractually selected forum."" Id. at 335. While this discussion was 
dicta, as only the scope of the choice of law clause was at issue, it supports our view that the ISDA forum selection clause 
reaches beyond purely contractual claims. "
222,59," Plaintiffs, relying on Atlantic Marine Construction Co. v. U.S. District Court, 571 U.S.    , 134 S. Ct. 568, 187 L. Ed. 2d 487 
(2013), argue that the appropriate remedy for violation of a forum-selection clause is transfer to the appropriate venue pursuant 
to 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a) rather than dismissal. In Atlantic Marine, the Supreme Court held [*182]  that a district court should not 
deny a section 1404(a) motion premised on a valid forum selection clause absent ""extraordinary circumstances unrelated to the 
convenience of the parties."" 134 S. Ct. at 581. The Supreme Court expressly reserved judgment on whether a forum-selection 
clause could be the basis of a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). See id. at 580. Thus, Atlantic Marine does not disturb 
Second Circuit precedent holding that a court may enforce a forum selection clause by granting a motion to dismiss. Further, as 
explained in section 7.1 below, we are without power to order a § 1404(a) transfer in this MDL context. "
223,60," The ""affirmative relief"" doctrine holds that a defendant impliedly consents to jurisdiction when the defendant itself brings suit in 
the same forum concerning the same transaction [*184]  or occurrence. See Dow Chem. Co. v. Calderon, 422 F.3d 827, 834 
(9th Cir. 2005); Gen. Contracting & Trading Co. v. Interpole, Inc., 940 F.2d 20, 23-25 (1st Cir. 1991). Defendants' success in 
having certain claims dismissed with prejudice in the earlier Schwab cases does not constitute affirmative relief under this 
doctrine."
223,61," Unlike defendants, we are unpersuaded that the Supreme Court's decision in Walden dramatically revised the law of specific 
personal jurisdiction. Nonetheless, in Gucci, the Second Circuit concluded that the appropriate course of action was to remand 
for the district court to consider the appellant's specific personal jurisdictional arguments in the first instance, without considering 
whether those arguments had been waived or forfeited. See Gucci, 768 F.3d at 138."
223,62," Because our conclusion depends on the particular procedural circumstances, it is not inconsistent with the recent decision in 
the Yen LIBOR case precluding a personal jurisdiction argument made by certain [*186]  defendants that had previously made a 
""deliberate, strategic decision to give [the] Court the impression that they had forgone making . . . motions [to dismiss for lack of 
personal jurisdiction]."" Order at 5, Laydon v. Mizuho Bank, Ltd., No. 12-cv-3419 (GBD), 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 107728 (S.D.N.Y.

223,63," To the extent that plaintiffs are unable to complete such a spreadsheet in accordance with our rulings, they should describe 
with particularity the information that they require and that is not in their possession. "
224,64," These rulings apply to specific personal jurisdiction only, as we have rejected the plaintiffs' arguments for that general 
personal jurisdiction exists as to the moving defendants."

225,68," Plaintiffs' allegation that the BBA's agent, Thomson Reuters, was headquartered in New York does not logically imply that the 
BBA [*191]  or Thomson Reuters calculated LIBOR in New York."
225,69," In re Electronic Books Antitrust Litig., No. 11-md-2293 (DLC), 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 57414, 2014 WL 1642813 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 
24, 2014), is not on point both because, as a parens patriæ action, it was amenable to transfer for trial under 28 U.S.C. § 
1407(h), and because the court found that the defendant was estopped from opposing venue in the transferee court. See 2014 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 57414, at *43-44, 2014 WL 1642813, at *14."
225,70," Plaintiffs rightly observe that some courts have held or at least assumed that, notwithstanding Lexecon, an MDL transferee 
court may retain a member case for trial on the consent of all parties. See, e.g., In re Brand-Name Prescription Drugs Antitrust 
Litig., 264 F. Supp. 2d 1372, 1377 n.4 (J.P.M.L. 2003). Here, of course, defendants have not agreed to [*193]  a ""Lexecon 
waiver."" "
226,71," These circumstances distinguish In re Ski Train Fire in Kaprun, Austria on Nov. 11, 2000, 257 F. Supp. 2d 717, 734-35 & n.31 
(S.D.N.Y. 2003), in which it was clear that there was only one possibly appropriate venue in the United States. "
227,72," Understandably, some individual plaintiffs have chosen to focus solely on a theory of persistent suppression. Trader-based 
manipulation, as disclosed so far, tended to shade LIBOR by fractions of basis points, while persistent suppression may have 
skewed LIBOR by dozens of basis points, potentially causing far greater losses. Furthermore, for plaintiffs who received floating 
rates through stable, long-term positions, trader-based manipulation cut in their favor as often as it cut against them, while 
persistent suppression was always harmful. For these plaintiffs, trader-based manipulation, causing less injury, is more difficult 
to plead."
227,73," A single bank's upward manipulation, by itself, cannot have affected published LIBOR if the bank's manipulated quote 
nevertheless was in the bottom quartile or tied with quotes in the bottom quartile. Likewise, a single bank's downward 
manipulation, by itself, cannot [*197]  have affected published LIBOR if the bank's manipulated quote was in the top quartile or 
tied with quotes in the top quartile."
227,74," For example, as of May 22, 2015, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange reported 9,751 open contracts in 1-month Eurodollar 
futures, compared with 11,504,967 contracts in 3-month futures. See CME Group, ftp://ftp.cmegroup.com/pub/settle/stlint (daily 
price and volume data for interest-rate products) (last visited May 26, 2015, 3:47 P.M.). "
228,75," It is conceivable that a bank's downward manipulation could affect LIBOR even though the bank ultimately falls into the upper 
quartile, but only if at least one other bank suppresses LIBOR on the same day. See infra at note 140. We have not seen this circumstance arise in the context of trader-based manipulation, mostly because there are very few dates 
when multiple banks manipulated LIBOR for the benefit of traders. However, it is likely that, in the context of persistent 
suppression, some banks will be liable in part for suppression even though their submissions fell in the upper quartile."
228,76," This includes allegations that Barclays collaborated with other banks to manipulate LIBOR on October 26, 2006, February 28, 
2007, and March 29, 2007. "
229,77," Nevertheless, no plaintiff is dismissed as a party, because each plaintiff plausibly states that he traded throughout the period 
of persistent suppression."
229,78," The Amabile Plaintiffs need not participate in this project, except to the extent that they wish to add new information from 
Deutsche Bank's recent settlements."
229,79," The one exception is that plaintiffs may include allegations using newly revealed information from Deutsche Bank's recent 
settlements. "
231,80," Prudential appears to accept that this principle applies to New Jersey RICO as well, as Prudential alleges that the relevant 
enterprise was ""[d]efendants' collective association, including as members of [*208]  the BBA's USD Libor panel."" Prudential 
Am. Compl. ¶ 460. "
233,81," Plaintiffs' supplemental submission, referring to a Deutsche Bank Consent Order, supports the conclusion that some banks 
were aware of other banks' inaccurate LIBOR reports. On June 3, 2008, a Deutsche Bank submitter wrote, ""[B]anks have wised 
up to the fact that if they leave their second bid much lower (every bank can put 2 separate bids in) all it takes is for one person 
to get filled at that lower price for the whole alotment [sic] to be filled there. So the low rate doesn't tell us there is necessarily 
lower demand particularly given the bid to cover was higher. It will however keep 1m libor down and also help to bring the 
eur/usd fwds back to the left."" Consent Order ¶ 50, Deutsche Bank AG (N.Y. State Dep't of Fin. Servs. [*215]  Apr. 23, 2015). 
Whatever this means, it does not appear to indicate a conspiracy. At the most, it shows that Deutsche Bank was aware that (1) 
banks were suppressing USD LIBOR, and (2) banks had found a clever way to cover their suppression to some extent."
233,82," The Barclays employee's metaphor is apt. The defender of a medieval castle did not shield his head behind a parapet out of 
an agreement with his comrades to do so, but because he wished for his own sake to avoid his enemy's arrows. "
235,83," Defendants argue that Alabama, Georgia, Illinois, Kansas, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Texas do not recognize a cause of action 
for aiding and abetting a tort (especially fraud). We do not examine the law of Alabama, Georgia, Illinois, Kansas, or Ohio at this 
time because defendants have retreated from their initial insistence that the substantive home-state law of each failed bank 
applies in FDIC. See Spreadsheet (""Joint Conflicts Spreadsheet"") at 13 n.24, Mar. 9, 2015, ECF No. 1097-2. We agree with 
Houston and the Philadelphia Plaintiffs that Pennsylvania and Texas would likely recognize an aiding and abetting theory, 
although neither state's Supreme Court has decided [*221]  the question. See Adelphia Recovery Trust v. Bank of Am., N.A., 
624 F. Supp. 2d 292, 309-12 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (thoroughly examining Pennsylvania law), reconsideration granted in part on other 
grounds, No. 05-cv-9050 (LMM), 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 51460, 2009 WL 1676077 (S.D.N.Y. June 16, 2009); Crisp v. Sw. 
Bancshares Leasing Co., 586 S.W.2d 610 (Tex. Civ. App. Amarillo 1979) (affirming jury verdict of liability for aiding and abetting 
fraud); cf. Skipworth ex rel. Williams v. Lead Indus. Ass'n, 547 Pa. 224, 234-35, 690 A.2d 169, 174 (1997) (applying 
Restatement approach to conspiracy and ""concert of action"" claim, and affirming dismissal of complaint for insufficient pleading); 
Juhl v. Airington, 936 S.W.2d 640, 643-45 (Tex. 1996) (declining to accept or reject ""concert of action"" theory when plaintiff failed 
to demonstrate defendant's substantial assistance of a tort). "
236,84," No party has adopted our suggestion at oral argument that New York choice-of-law [*226]  principles may point to English law, 
especially as to false data claims. "
237,85," Defendants, in their opening brief, stated that the elements of fraud are essentially the same in every relevant jurisdiction. 
Defendants were on notice that Capital Ventures was a Caymanian entity, and so defendants presumably intended this 
statement to encompass Caymanian law. However, [*227]  defendants did not provide any citation to Caymanian law, binding 
Privy Council precedent, or persuasive English precedent. "
238,86," We have previously accepted, in the context of the Exchange-Based Plaintiffs' claims, [*231]  that current LIBOR manipulation 
affects the market's estimate of future LIBOR. See LIBOR I, 935 F. Supp. 2d at 716. "
240,87," These plaintiffs' inability to find a true manipulation boosts our confidence that there is nothing to the allegations of those 
plaintiffs who submitted less specific pleadings."
240,88," Some contracts (for example, CUSIP 64352VFZ9, listed in Prudential's complaint) did require the calculation agent to 
generate its own estimate of inter-bank rates, but only in the event that LIBOR was not published on a particular date. "
241,89," According to these provisions, most types of breaches do not become ""Events of Default"" until notice has been given and a 
grace period has passed, but a breach can be a ""Potential Event of Default"" immediately. "
243,90," This set of entities plausibly includes the panel banks themselves and entities that employed swap dealers, who appear to 
have interacted closely with LIBOR submitters at many institutions. However, no complaint supports a conclusion that brokerage 
entities possessed inside information regarding LIBOR manipulation. [*246]"
243,91," This analysis applies with equal force to the Philadelphia Plaintiffs' termination of swaps whose payments were based on 
SIFMA's Municipal Swap Index. The relevant fact is that the parties improvidently relied on LIBOR to estimate the future 
payments. It is irrelevant whether those future payments were themselves defined with reference to LIBOR itself, the Municipal 
Swap Index, or any other index. The Darby Plaintiffs mention swap terminations generally, but fail to identify any particular swap terminations that were affected 
by the manipulated LIBOR forward curve. "
246,92," As an entirely distinct limit, a plaintiff may not sue its own counterparty for fraud on the basis of false LIBOR submissions. If a 
plaintiff's counterparty manipulated LIBOR to plaintiff's disadvantage, then the counterparty breached the implied covenant of 
good faith and fair dealing, and is properly liable in contract and not as a duplicative fraud claim. This is so, even though plaintiff 
would be unable to obtain punitive damages in contract. See Koch Indus., Inc. v. Hoechst AG, 727 F. Supp. 2d 199, 214 n.20 
(S.D.N.Y. 2010). "
247,93," We of course express no view regarding the proper scope of the ""expected reliance class"" on the facts of Rio Grande or the 
court's conclusion that the Rio Grande plaintiffs failed to allege that the HSC Index ""represent[ed] or [wa]s calculated to 
represent true supply and demand. 786 F. Supp. 2d at 1208. According to the allegations in this case, the leading [*260]  
purpose of LIBOR was its incorporation into common financial contracts, and its leading virtue its accuracy. "
248,94," The plaintiff in Pasternack asserted that the defendant falsely reported plaintiff's drug-testing results to the Federal Aviation 
Administration, causing plaintiff to lose his pilot's license."
248,95," We include auction-rate securities in this holding. LIBOR was intended to be integrated into financial contracts. Even if 
LIBOR's use as a ""backup"" interest rate was comparatively uncommon, this use still falls comfortably within the intended 
purposes of LIBOR."
248,96," This includes the Schwab Plaintiffs, who ostensibly relied on LIBOR to buy non-LIBOR-based bonds in preference to LIBOR-
based instruments. "
249,97," Some plaintiffs have every reason to avoid theories of efficient markets. If the market in interest rate swaps was efficient 
during the persistent suppression period, then the fixed-leg pricing would have compensated for LIBOR suppression. Plaintiffs 
who entered into pay-fixed swaps in the middle of 2008 would have received fair settlements as long as suppression persisted, 
and better-than-fair settlements once LIBOR returned to its natural level."
249,98," Of course, if by chance a particular defendant's manipulation did not affect LIBOR on a particular day, then defendant would 
not be liable for damages. Our pleading standards properly account for this. A trader-based plaintiff must show an effect on a 
particular LIBOR on a particular day. At this stage, a persistent suppression plaintiff need not, because defendants allegedly 
manipulated LIBOR simultaneously on such a large scale that it is plausible that all the defendants affected LIBOR on [*267]  
each day. "
250,99," The ""calculation agent"" for an asset-backed security serves a different function—splitting the loan servicer's proceeds among 
the tiers of beneficiaries. It is not clear whether this calculation depends on LIBOR. To the extent it does, our conclusions in this 
section carry forward."
250,100," The parties disagree whether a plaintiff's reliance need be reasonable, justifiable, or (under Texas law) neither. See, e.g., 
Gordon & Co. v. Ross, 84 F.3d 542, 546 (2d Cir. 1996) (""The proper test of reliance in a fraud case is not 'reasonable' reliance, it 
is 'justifiable' reliance, a clearly less burdensome test.""); Koral Indus., Inc. v. Sec.-Conn. Life Ins. Co., 788 S.W.2d 136, 146 (Tex. 
App. Dallas) (""[A] jury finding that the defrauded party, by the exercise of reasonable diligence, should have known of the false 
representations is immaterial.""), application for writ of error denied, 802 S.W.2d 650 (Tex. 1990) (per curiam). We do not resolve 
this question because our conclusions would be the same as to either ""justifiable"" or ""reasonable"" reliance, and we use the two 
words interchangeably. "
252,101," Rule 9(b) applies to negligent misrepresentation, which is in the nature of ""mistake."" See Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co. v. Aniero 
Concrete Co., 404 F.3d 566 (2d Cir. 2005) (incorporating District Court opinion, 404 F.3d at 583 n.14 (S.D.N.Y. 1998))."
252,102," Wilson does not contain an exposition of the facts. It appears that the case involved the defendant's mishandling of the 
plaintiff's request for a loan modification. Without ultimately resolving the question, the court stated, ""whether a lender owes a 
duty of care to a borrower depends on a balancing of several factors, including the extent to which the transaction was intended 
to affect the plaintiff, the foreseeability of harm, plaintiff's injury, the connection between the injury and defendant's conduct, 
moral blame attaching to defendant's conduct, and the policy of preventing future harm."" 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46126, at *15,

254,107," In light of our jurisdictional conclusions, see supra at 95, we do not reach the question of whether plaintiffs have adequately 
alleged that the BBA committed fraud (either directly or on an aiding and abetting theory) by publishing LIBORs that integrated 
the panel banks' false submissions. "
257,108," As a practical matter, plaintiffs' tortious interference claims add little value to this litigation. Because plaintiffs cannot prove 
tortious interference against one entity without proving a breach of contract claim against another entity, it is unlikely that the 
tortious interference claims will result in greater damages. Tortious interference is most valuable when a plaintiff's counterparty is 
judgment-proof or otherwise unsuable, unlikely scenarios here. Punitive damages are available (at least in some states), but are 
disfavored for the same reason that punitive damages are unavailable in contract. ""So long as the party subject to the breach is 
compensated to the extent of his loss, there is no reason to penalize the breaching party for refusing to perform his contractual 
obligations."" Dependahl v. Falstaff Brewing Corp., 653 F.2d 1208, 1217 (8th Cir. 1981); but cf. Cervecería Modelo, S.A. de C.V. 
v. USPA Accessories LLC, No. 07-cv-7998 (HB), 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 28999, at *20, 2008 WL 1710910, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 
10, 2008) (suggesting that New York law permits punitive damages when ""tortious interference with contract was part of a 
practice directed at the public generally""). [*290] "
267,109," In Blue Shield, for example, Blue Shield of Virginia covered patients' psychological services but (allegedly because of a 
conspiracy with psychiatrists) refused to reimburse patients for services that psychologists rendered and billed. The plaintiff, an 
insured of Blue Shield, wished to be reimbursed for her sessions with a psychologist. The plaintiff's inability to receive 
reimbursements was an immediate consequence of Blue Shield's boycott. No other cause intervened, and the harm plaintiff 
suffered was ""integral"" to the conspiracy even though it was not the conspiracy's alleged purpose. Blue Shield is distinguishable from the LIBOR cases for another [*320]  reason. Defendants in Blue Shield advanced the 
hypothetical that Blue Shield could have refused psychological reimbursements without a conspiracy, leaving plaintiff with the 
same injury as with a conspiracy. See 457 U.S. at 480 n.16. This hypothetical, while theoretically possible, is unpersuasive 
because an insurer has no strong independent reason to prefer psychiatrists over psychologists absent a conspiracy with the 
psychiatrists. Even though conspiracy was not a strict logical predicate, conspiracy was the leading (or perhaps the only) 
practical reason for plaintiff's injury. By contrast, the panel banks had compelling independent motivations to manipulate LIBOR. 
It is not that independent manipulation could have conceivably caused the same injuries that were allegedly caused in this 
instance by conspiracy, but that independent manipulation could have easily, realistically, and naturally caused the same 
injuries."
267,110," The complaints under consideration in LIBOR I focused on suppression of LIBOR, but the second half of this comment holds 
true for LIBOR inflation as well: if any bank was a net borrower [*322]  of floating-rate products, then that bank had an incentive 
to inflate its submissions. "

273,125," In declining to reach this issue, we avoid three difficult questions. First, whether Kansas courts (where NCUA was filed) would

whichever state's contract law results from the first question, whether the ISDA Agreement's precise language requires us to 
apply New York law [*339]  to all causes of action related to the contract, or only to claims for breach of contract. Third, if the "

would apply California statutory law to Wescorp's injury. Courts are divided on the first question, and we have found no Kansas

286,140," As an elaboration on this concept, suppose that one of the low-interest banks inflated its quote by 0.25% and the other by 
0.35%. The two would be jointly and severally responsible [*377]  for the 0.03125% increase in LIBOR caused by their mutual 
increase from 2.00% to 2.25%, but only the second bank would be responsible for the additional 0.0125% increase in LIBOR 
caused by its additional increase from 2.25% to 2.35%. This example highlights two points. First, that different sets of banks may 
be responsible for portions of LIBOR manipulation on a particular day. Second, that a bank whose submission was omitted from 
the BBA's calculation may, under some circumstances involving simultaneous manipulation by other banks, nevertheless be 
responsible for a portion of LIBOR manipulation. "
287,141," Of course, a plaintiff that wins a judgment against each one may recover the full amount from either."
287,142," We express no view as to whether a counterparty that is liable under this theory for other panel banks' manipulation may seek 
contribution or indemnification from the panel banks. "
290,143," Defendants have previously accepted that plaintiffs were not on inquiry notice of manipulation that occurred on August 6, 
2007. See LIBOR III, 27 F. Supp. 3d at 464 n.12. We have not decided precisely which August dates were within the scope of 
plaintiffs' inquiry notice, but we now think it fair to define Period One more precisely. The articles published in Spring 2008 
generally associated LIBOR's inaccuracy with the ""credit crunch"" or ""credit crisis."" See, e.g., Gavin Finch & Elliott Gotkine, Libor 
Banks Misstated Rates, Bond at Barclays Says, Bloomberg.com, May 29, 2008 (""Banks routinely misstated borrowing costs . . . 
to avoid the perception they faced difficulty raising funds as credit markets seized up.""); Carrick Mollenkamp, Bankers Cast 
Doubt on Key Rate amid Crisis, Wall St. J., Apr. 16, 2008. Accordingly, a reasonable investor would have investigated LIBOR 
manipulation that occurred during the ""credit crunch."" From the perspective of an investor in mid-2008, this started on August 9, 
2007, when overnight LIBOR spiked upward by over half a percent, and when severe illiquidity [*390]  in subprime mortgage 
securities first forced central banks to offer emergency credit to major banks. See Markus K. Brunnermeier, Deciphering the 
Liquidity and Credit Crunch 2007-2008, 23 J. Econ. Perspectives 77, 85 (Winter 2009) (describing timeline of credit crisis). "
291,144," One declaration is from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's former executive director of interest-rate products. Barker Decl., 
ECF No. 873. Another is from a manager of one of the Amabile Plaintiffs, who considers himself and his firm to be ""highly 
sophisticated and knowledgeable in the various financial instruments the fund deals in,"" including Eurodollar futures. Rane Decl. 
¶ 4, ECF No. 874. The third is from an individual [*395]  plaintiff who traded Eurodollar futures. Restani Decl., ECF No. 876."
291,145," It is not clear whether banks' balance sheets were, on net, positively or negatively affected by LIBOR suppression. Although 
banks lent money to some degree in adjustable-rate loans, it was well-known at the time that banks securitized many of these 
loans to pass the risk off to other investors. This point also misses that banks had enormous exposures to LIBOR through 
interest rate swaps and other derivatives."
291,146," This facilely conflates the ""trust"" that banks will pay back deposits with the ""trust"" that banks will tell the truth to the British 
Bankers' Association. A bank that is not trusted to pay back deposits will face a run. A bank that is not trusted to tell the truth to 
the BBA may face regulation and litigation, but not a run. "
292,147," In fact, as we have noted many times, LIBOR suppression did not depend on the existence of collusion. Nevertheless, the 
possibility of collusion was yet another reason for an investor to inquire."
292,148," Surely sober, cogent denials would have been more convincing."
292,149," This is as much a red flag as it is a comfort. As the 2008 articles suggested, the main problem with LIBOR was that the banks 
suppressed [*396]  their LIBOR quotes in order to avoid appearing uncreditworthy. Scrutinizing outliers would only exacerbate 
the incentive for each bank to stay in the pack."
292,150, Another red flag.
292,151," The Principal Cases were transferred from the Southern District of Iowa, so we would normally apply Iowa's law alone. 
However, the Principal Plaintiffs filed amended complaints purporting to re-venue their cases in this [*397]  Court, and so the 
parties have agreed to apply New York limitations law, including the borrowing rule, for purposes of the present motions. 
Although we reject the Principal Plaintiffs' attempt to revenue their cases unilaterally, we conform our analysis to the parties' 
consensual acceptance of New York limitations law."
292,152," Texas law applies to Houston. The parties agree that no time runs against Houston under Texas's implementation of the 
doctrine that nullum tempus occurrit reipublicæ (""no time runs against the sovereign""), so we do not consider Texas's statute of 
limitations further. The parties agree that the same doctrine applies in Philadelphia under Pennsylvania law to the common law 
claims brought by PICA (a state agency), but not to claims brought by Philadelphia."
292,153," In particular, the parties appear to agree that California limitations law applies to claims filed in California by certain Schwab 
Plaintiffs [*398]  that are organized and headquartered outside California. "
293,154," Salix raises the same argument as Fannie Mae, but with greater force. We need not resolve this question in Salix because 
Connecticut law is no more restrictive than New York law in any manner relevant to this motion. See infra at 420."
293,155," The parties did not brief this issue, but this appears to be the crux of their competing analyses on, for example, page 59 of the 
Joint Limitations Spreadsheet. "
295,156," Congress added this provision to the FDIC's extender statute in 1994. See Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching 
Efficiency Act of 1994, Pub. L. No. 103-328, 108 Stat. 2338. We have not identified any legislative history indicating why 
Congress chose to distinguish the NCUA from the FDIC and the RTC."
295,157," The parties dispute whether the statute of limitations expired on negligent misrepresentation on behalf of Superior Bank and 
Lydian Private Bank, which were based in Alabama and Florida respectively. See infra at 402."
295,158," As discussed supra at 228, the NCUA's private UCL claim is for restitution, and is therefore arguably akin to other unjust 
enrichment claims. However, the NCUA appears [*406]  to concede that the extender statute's ""tort"" provision applies to its UCL 
claim. See Joint Limitations Spreadsheet at 59. "
296,159," The statute governing the FDIC operates similarly. The FDIC may be a conservator, a receiver, or both in succession. 
However, it appears that each failed bank in this case went straight into receivership, so that the issue of successive 
appointments is only relevant to the NCUA. [*410] "
297,160," The Second Circuit also analogized to the Bankruptcy Code, pointing out that a Chapter 7 trustee has 60 days to assume or 
reject a debtor's executory contracts regardless of whether the same trustee previously acted as the debtor's Chapter 11 trustee. 
See 1185 Ave. of the Americas, 22 F.3d at 497-98. The Bankruptcy Code does not provide a useful analogy for the statute of 
limitations issue, because the statute of limitations found in the Bankruptcy Code does not depend on the date of a trustee's 
appointment. See 11 U.S.C. § 108(a)(2) (permitting a trustee or debtor-in-possession to commence an action within ""two years 
after the order for relief""). The Eighth Circuit in CedarMinn relied in part on Chevron deference (see CedarMinn, 956 F.2d at 1450-51 (citing Chevron, 
U.S.A. Inc. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, 467 U.S. 837, 842-43, 104 S. Ct. 2778, 81 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1984))—mistakenly, because the 
RTC [*412]  was not the only federal agency responsible for administering FIRREA. See 1185 Ave. of the Americas, 22 F.3d at 
497. Neither the NCUA nor the FDIC argues for Chevron deference in this case. "
300,161," In analyzing the extender statutes, one might reasonably look to cases involving the government's general statute of 
limitations, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2415-16, because the extender statutes are in many ways akin to those sections. In this context, such 
reliance would not be appropriate, since these cases rely on the text of section 2416, which explicitly provides a discovery rule. 
However, Congress included no analogous provision in the extender statutes, so we instead rely on the federal common law rule 
of Koch and LIBOR I. "
302,162," We defer to the D.C. Court of Appeals on matters of D.C. law. See Lee v. Flintkote Co., 593 F.2d 1275, 1278 n.14, 193 U.S. 
App. D.C. 121 (D.C. Cir. 1979). "
305,163," At this stage, we decline defendants' invitation to push this date earlier to May 19, 2008. No significant revelation occurred on 
May 19, 2008, and defendants may have selected this apparently arbitrary date to defeat a portion of the claims that Prudential 
filed on May 19, 2014. See LIBOR I, 935 F. Supp. 2d at 700-04; Decl. of Matthew Porpora, ECF No. 768 (attaching more news 
articles). Although we agree with defendants that many articles regarding possible LIBOR manipulation had been published by 
May 19, we prefer at the pleadings stage to place the date of inquiry notice at the end of the critical string of articles. This 
decision in no way forecloses a later finding that the date of inquiry notice was in fact earlier than May 29. "
308,164," We use the phrase ""American Pipe tolling"" to refer specifically to the federal-law doctrine set forth in American Pipe & 
Construction Co. v. Utah, 414 U.S. 538, 94 S. Ct. 756, 38 L. Ed. 2d 713 (1974), and ""class-action tolling"" to refer to the concept 
more generally."
308,165," The Courts of Appeals disagree as to whether federal class-action tolling is available to a class member who files his 
separate case while the associated class action is still viable. Compare State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Boellstorff, 540 F.3d 
1223, 1228 (10th Cir. 2008) (applying class-action tolling under Colorado law), In re Hanford Nuclear Reservation Litig., 521 
F.3d 1028, 1038-39 (9th Cir.) (same, federal law), amended, 534 F.3d 986, 1008-09 (9th Cir. 2008), and In re WorldCom Sec. 
Litig., 496 F.3d 245, 254-56 (2d Cir. 2007) (same, federal law), with Wyser-Pratte Mgmt. Co. v. Telxon Corp., 413 F.3d 553, 569 
(6th Cir. 2005) (declining to apply class-action tolling under federal law), and Glater v. Eli Lilly & Co., 712 F.2d 735, 739 (1st Cir. 
1983) (same, New Hampshire law). Defendants have not argued that any particular state would decline to follow the Second "
309,," Circuit's well-reasoned holding that class-action tolling is available in such [*442]  a circumstance. We note that none of the MDL 
cases with disputed limitations issues will be remanded to courts in the First or Sixth Circuit."
309,166," Plaintiffs vigorously disagree with approach of following state law. Indeed, Chardon v. Fumero Soto, 462 U.S. 650, 103 S. Ct. 
2611, 77 L. Ed. 2d 74 (1983), indicates in dicta that a state must provide individual plaintiffs with some ""saving"" mechanism to 
vindicate the federal interest in encouraging class actions. Regardless of the merits of plaintiffs' argument, we are bound by 
Casey III to accept a state's total rejection of class-action tolling."
309,167," Some parties have suggested certifying questions to the Connecticut and Iowa Supreme Courts, which permit certification 
from federal district courts. There is no need to do so because we can make appropriate Erie predictions, none of these issues is 
critical to this litigation as a whole, and none of these issues is so unlikely to arise in state-court litigation that certification is 
necessary to permit the state Supreme Courts to determine state law. "
310,168," Defendants accept Staub, an intermediate appellate case, as a persuasive indicator of New Jersey law. Even if it were not, 
we would arrive at the same result for the reasons stated below. "
311,169," We treat Second Circuit cases as binding precedent and out-of-circuit cases as persuasive precedent in this opinion, both for 
the formal reason that we sit within the Second Circuit and for the practical reason that this opinion is more likely to be reviewed 
by the Second Circuit than by any other court. Nevertheless, because certain cases in this MDL might conceivably be remanded 
to California district courts and appealed to the Ninth Circuit, it bears noting that, although we decline to follow the reasoning of 
these Ninth Circuit cases, we do not believe that our result is ultimately any different than would be obtained by applying 
Hatfield's ""equitable tolling"" doctrine. "
313,170," In point of fact, the only relevant non-resident plaintiffs are some of the Schwab plaintiffs. These entities barely benefit from 
class-action tolling, because tolling ended for them when they filed their first individual complaints in August 2011. "
318,171, See supra at 43 for a discussion of the subsequent appellate history.
318,172," See Compl., Charles Schwab, No. CGC-13-531016 (Cal. Super. Ct. S.F. Cty., Apr. 29, 2013), filed after removal and transfer 
as No. 13-cv-7005 (S.D.N.Y.), ECF No. 1, Ex. A. "
319,173," We dismissed Baltimore in its entirety on the same date. However, because plaintiffs in that case successfully moved for 
reconsideration as to their state-law claims, we will permit tolling on the basis [*472]  of Baltimore's state-law claims even after 
March 29, 2013. Of course, claims against defendants dismissed in LIBOR III are not tolled following the date of that decision 
(June 23, 2014)."
319,174," We include in the following charts cases cited by the Individual Plaintiffs in the spreadsheet submitted following oral 
argument. See ECF No. 1061-1."
319,175," To be clear, this and all other references to complaints in Metzler refers to the complaint in case number 11-cv-2613, formerly 
captioned as FTC Capital GmbH v. Credit Suisse Group AG. Plaintiffs do not rely for tolling on any complaint filed in Metzler "
320,," Investment GmbH v. Credit Suisse Group AG, No. 11-cv-7676 (S.D.N.Y.), which has been consolidated with case number 11-
cv-2613. "
334,176," Additionally, Rule 15(c)(1)(A) allows relation back when ""the law that provides the applicable statute of limitations allows 
relation back."" Plaintiffs do not argue that any relevant state law permits relation back when federal law otherwise does not."
334,177," These included: Bank of America Corporation; Bank of America, N.A.; Barclays Bank PLC; Citigroup, Inc.; Citibank, N.A.; 
Credit Suisse Group AG; JPMorgan Chase & Co.; JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.; Lloyds Banking Group PLC; The Royal Bank of 
Scotland Group PLC; and UBS AG."
334,178," Both complaints added Barclays Capital, Inc.; Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.; Credit Suisse AG; Credit Suisse International; 
Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC; Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.; JPMorgan Bank Dublin PLC; J.P. Morgan Securities, LLC; 
Lloyds Bank PLC; Merrill Lynch Capital Services, Inc. (a Bank of [*485]  America affiliate); Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, 
Inc. (also a Bank of America affiliate); The Royal Bank of Scotland PLC; RBS Securities, Inc.; and UBS Securities LLC. 
Additionally, the Principal Financial Group Amended Complaint added Chase Bank USA, N.A. (a JPMorgan affiliate) and Credit 
Suisse International. "
335,179," Namely: Merrill Lynch Capital Services, Inc.; Barclays Bank PLC; Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC; Credit Suisse 
International; Chase Bank USA, N.A.; JPMorgan Bank Dublin PLC; The Royal Bank of Scotland PLC; and RBS Securities, Inc. 
Principal Fin. Grp. Am. Compl. ¶ 203."
335,180," It remains unclear which security this referred to. The amended complaint lists Citigroup Global Markets Inc. as an 
underwriter or manager of dozens of securities."
335,181," Additionally, the table at paragraph 141 lists four swaps by ID numbers and counterparties. We need not decide whether this 
table could have provided sufficient information to identify a security or contract because each listed counterparty was either 
named in the Original Complaint [*487]  (Bank of America, N.A., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and UBS AG) or not named in the 
Amended Complaint (Morgan Stanley Capital Services). "
336,182," In fact, the second amended complaint hedges by alleging that ""Credit Suisse Group AG and/or Credit Suisse AG was at all 
relevant times a member of the USD Libor panel."" "
337,183," Although all plaintiffs appear to be Illinois residents, defendants do not rely on New York's borrowing rule at this stage. See 
Def. Master App., Ex. L, at 3. It appears that Illinois's limitations period is longer than New York's. "
339,184," When a complaint refers to August 2007, we assume that the plaintiff intends the pleaded manipulation period to begin on 
August 9, 2007. No complaint provides data indicating that persistent suppression occurred before the 2007 credit crisis, and 
this aligns with our inquiry notice holding. "
342,185," Although the complaint refers to ""at least August 2007 through at least the end of 2010"" as the ""Relevant Period,"" neither 
plaintiff alleges making any LIBOR-related payments or entering into any LIBOR-related swap agreements after 2010."
342,186," We agree with defendants that an unjust enrichment claim sounding in tort for monetary relief is governed by a three-year 
statute of limitations, at least to the extent that the unjust enrichment claim is not duplicative of a contract claim. See Ingrami v. 
Rovner, 45 A.D.3d 806, 808, 847 N.Y.S.2d 132, 134 (2d Dep't 2007). "
345,187," Washington Mutual was incorporated in Nevada and headquartered in Washington. The parties do not identify any relevant 
difference [*510]  between Nevada and Washington law. "
346,188," Kansas, home to Hillcrest, does not recognize class-action tolling, and Illinois, home to four failed banks, does not recognize 
cross-jurisdictional tolling. Ohio, home to AmTrust, does. The parties did not thoroughly brief the remaining home-state laws, so 
we assume for purposes of the present motion that each remaining state follows the federal practice."
346,189," IndyMac fell into receivership before August 5, 2008, so we interpret the FDIC's complaint to allege [*514]  that the FDIC 
itself, in its capacity as receiver, relied on the BBA's August 5 statement. "
347,190," Alabama, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, Ohio, Puerto Rico, and Washington. "
349,191," We agree with the FDIC that Colorado's limitations period for negligent misrepresentation runs for three years, pursuant to 
section 13-80-101(1)(c) of the Colorado Revised Statutes. "
350,192," Superior, Community of Colorado, Lydian, Integra, and First National. "
351,193," Those named in the original Metzler complaint: Bank of America Corp.; Barclays Bank PLC; Citibank, N.A.; Credit Suisse 
Group AG; Deutsche Bank AG; HSBC Holdings PLC; JPMorgan Chase & Co.; Lloyds Banking Group PLC; the Norinchukin 
Bank; the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC; UBS AG; and WestLB AG (now Portigon AG)."
351,194," Those named in the first amended Baltimore complaint, but not in the original Metzler complaint: Bank of America, N.A.; Bank 
of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd.; Citigroup Inc.; Coöperatieve Centrale Raiffeisen Boerenleenbank B.A.; HBOS PLC; HSBC Bank 
PLC; JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.; Royal Bank of Canada; and Westdeutsche ImmobilienBank AG. [*523] "
352,195," The NCUA [*524]  brings only antitrust claims on behalf of Constitution. Defendants do not challenge these claims on 
grounds of timeliness."
352,196," Kansas applies a savings statute instead of class-action tolling, and Illinois, home to one of the failed credit unions, does not 
recognize cross-jurisdictional tolling. We have predicted that California would do so. As with the FDIC's claims, the parties did 
not thoroughly brief Texas law, so we have assumed for purposes of the present motion that Texas permits cross-jurisdictional 
tolling. But cf. Newby v. Enron Corp., 542 F.3d 463, 472 (5th Cir. 2008) (predicting that Texas would not recognize cross-
jurisdictional class-action tolling)."
352,197," As with the FDIC complaint, we assume that each relevant state would accept a filing on Monday, April 30, 2012, that was 
timely on the previous Saturday, April 28, 2012. Therefore, we count limitations periods for Group B back from April 28, 2012. "
353,198," Texas law would not bar claims arising before August 9, 2007, because the credit unions were not on inquiry notice of these 
claims. However, these claims are independently barred by Kansas's three-year limitations period, to which no discovery rule 
applies. "
354,199," For purposes of this motion, we assume without deciding that the phrase ""debt security"" in both Gelboim complaints 
encompasses asset-backed securities. "
356,200," The statute of limitations for an action to impose a constructive trust is six years. See Congregation Yetev Lev D'Satmar, Inc. 
v. 26 Adar N.B. Corp., 192 A.D.2d 501, 503, 596 N.Y.S.2d 435, 437 (2d Dep't 1993). However, the constructive trust remedy is 
unavailable in New York when, as here, money damages are adequate. In that circumstance, a plaintiff may not ""sidestep the 
statute of limitations"" by requesting a constructive trust instead of damages. Pons v. People's Rep. of China, 666 F. Supp. 2d 
406, 415 (S.D.N.Y. 2009)."
356,201," We believe, but do not find, that this includes Bank of America Corp., Citibank, N.A., and JPMorgan Chase & Co. "
357,202," If, as Salix asserts, Credit Suisse AG was a panel bank rather than Credit Suisse Group AG, then it was a mistake for Credit 
Suisse Group AG to be named as a panel-bank defendant in Metzler and other class actions. Credit Suisse AG plausibly had 
notice of the class actions and notice of the mistake, so (at least for purposes of this motion) class-action tolling applies to claims 
against Credit Suisse AG as though Credit Suisse AG had been named in each of the relevant class actions. "
359,203," Throughout this discussion, August 23 dates apply to the plaintiffs who filed on August 23, and August 27 dates apply to the 
plaintiffs who filed on Monday, August 29. "

377,1," Specifically, DFA's proposal had listed a ""significant number of Estée Lauder brand items"" that would be sold in its Orlando 
stores. Next, the promotional brochure that DFA included with its proposal made multiple references to Estée Lauder. First, the 
brochure included a section entitled ""DFA Name Brands."" Both Estée Lauder and Clinique -- one of Estée [**12]  Lauder's 
brands -- were included in this list. Second, the brochure included pictures of DFA retail space in which Estée Lauder and 
Clinique signage and products were visible. Finally, during the interview that the Airport Authority conducted after the proposals 
were submitted, when DFA representatives were asked to confirm that the company had ""a direct merchandise purchasing 
relationship with all that brands [it was] offering,"" both representatives responded ""yes"" to the question."
377,2," DFA also alleges that Estée Lauder engaged in similar conduct toward another of its partners, Concourse Concessions. 
Concourse Concessions partners with DFA to run duty free stores in three airports -- Miami, Dulles, and San Diego -- but 
partners with another operator in the Los Angeles airport. Estée Lauder has refused to sell products to Concourse Concessions 
for resale in Miami, Dulles, and San Diego, but supplies the operator with products for its Los Angeles location. "
378,3," An attorney representing Nuance later contacted Bottrie, seeking confirmation that Estée Lauder had not resumed relations 
with DFA. Bottrie responded with a similar letter to the one he sent to World Duty Free, stating that DFA had no relationship with 
Estée Lauder. [**16] "
381,4," DFA is not [**26]  completely clear in its complaint whether it is defining the relevant market as the market to sell or to 
manufacture beauty products to be sold in airport duty free stores. On the one hand, the complaint alleges that DFA licenses 
brand names and manufactures their products, and, on the other hand, the complaint posits that Estée Lauder has entered the 
sales side of the market by hiring its own staff to work in duty free stores and by placing vending machines in DFA-dedicated 
airports. Estée Lauder challenges both formulations, arguing that it is not a seller -- or at least not an airport duty free retailer -- 
and DFA is not a manufacturer. "
387,5," This Court usually considers six factors in determining whether a plaintiff would be an efficient enforcer of the antitrust laws: (1) 
whether the plaintiff has suffered a direct injury; (2) whether its injury is remote; (3) whether other plaintiffs are better suited to 
bring the suit; (4) whether the plaintiff's injuries are speculative; (5) whether the calculation of damages would be complex and 
run the risk of duplicative recoveries; and (6) whether the plaintiff could enforce the court's judgment. [**48]  Sunbeam Television 
Corp., 711 F.3d at 1271 (citing Associated Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc. v. Cal. State Council of Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 538-
45, 103 S. Ct. 897, 74 L. Ed. 2d 723 (1983)). When the plaintiff seeks only equitable relief, however, some of these factors -- 
such as the danger of duplicative recoveries, complexity of assessing damages, and the existence of more suitable plaintiffs -- 
are not implicated. Cargill, Inc. v. Monfort of Colorado, Inc., 479 U.S. 104, 111 n.6, 107 S. Ct. 484, 93 L. Ed. 2d 427 (1986)."
387,6," The Supreme Court's recent [**49]  decision in Lexmark Int'l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., 134 S. Ct. 1377, 188 L. 
Ed. 2d 392 (2014), casts doubt on the future of prudential standing doctrines such as antitrust standing. In Lexmark, the 
Supreme Court declined to adopt the antitrust standing test in the Lanham Act context. Id. at 1385-87, 1391. In the course of this 
discussion, the Court questioned referring to the test as one of prudential ""standing"" -- noting that, in actuality, it is neither 
prudential nor an inquiry into standing, but an analysis of whether the plaintiff's ""injuries were proximately caused by a 
defendant's antitrust violations."" Id. at 1386-87 n.4. This, the Court explained, is a statutory interpretation question about ""the 
scope of the private remedy created by Congress"" when it drafted the antitrust laws. Id. at 1386-87 (quotation omitted). 
However, Lexmark is a Lanham Act case, and this discussion is dicta. We do not ""lightly cast aside"" Supreme Court dicta, 
Schwab v. Crosby, 451 F.3d 1308, 1325 (11th Cir. 2006), but ""[u]nder the prior precedent rule, we are bound to follow a prior 
binding precedent unless and until it is overruled by this court en banc or by the Supreme Court."" United States v. Vega-Castillo, 
540 F.3d 1235, 1236 (11th Cir. 2008) (quotation omitted). In any event, any impact that Lexmark may have on the notion of 
antitrust standing is utterly immaterial in this case, because DFA has not established that it has Article III standing. [**50] "
391,7," DFA argues that the district court ought not to have considered these quotes, but should have credited the complaint's 
formulations, specifically (1) ""carrying [Estée Lauder] products is required for the success of a duty free store"" and (2) ""DFA's 
lack of access to [Estée Lauder] products will prevent it from being successful, including being able to meet its projected revenue 
targets."" DFA's summarized false statements are indistinguishable from the quotations in substance. And its claim fares no 
better if they are substituted for the actual statements that the operators made to airport authorities."
391,8," DFA again argues that we must consider its preferred formulation: ""DFA did not have the ability to sell the [Estée Lauder] 
products it had listed in its [Atlanta] bid."" The substitution of this phrasing would be similarly immaterial. "
392,9," Florida's Standard Jury Instructions, though merely persuasive, also confirm our understanding of Florida law. They read, in 
relevant [**67]  part: A person who interferes with the business relations of another with the motive and purpose, at least in part, to advance [or 
protect] his own business [or financial] interests, does not interfere with an improper motive. But one who interferes only out 
of spite, or to do injury to others, or for other bad motive, has no justification, and his interference is improper. So also, a 
person who interferes with another's business relations using ordinary business methods [of competition] does not interfere 
by an improper method. But one who uses [physical violence], [misrepresentations], [illegal conduct], [threats of illegal 
conduct], [or] [(identify other improper conduct)] has no privilege to use those methods, and his interference using such 
methods is improper. Standard Jury Instructions-Civil Cases (99-1), 778 So. 2d 264, 269 (Fla. 2000) (footnotes omitted). "
396,1," By order filed August 5, 2015, the Court found the matter appropriate for decision on the parties' respective written 
submissions, vacated the hearing scheduled for August 7, 2015, and took the matter under submission."
396,2," For [*3]  purposes of the instant motion, the following facts, which are taken from ATopTech's Second Amended Answer to 
Amended Complaint and Second Amended Counterclaims (""SACC""), are accepted as true and construed in the light most 
favorable to ATopTech, the nonmoving party. See NL Industries, Inc. v. Kaplan, 792 F. 2d 896, 898 (9th Cir. 1986)."
396,3," ATopTech ""believes its market share may be slightly higher, but . . . less than 3%."" (See id. ¶ 71.) "
398,4," Synopsys also cites United States v. Microsoft, 253 F.3d 34, 64, 346 U.S. App. D.C. 330 (D.C. Cir. 2001). In Microsoft, 
however, there was no claim of copyright misuse and, indeed, there is no mention of copyright misuse in the opinion."
398,5," In the Factual Background section of the SACC, ATopTech makes reference to Synopsys' Milkyway Development Kit End-User 
License Agreement for Synopsys Licensed Software (""Milkyway Agreement""). (See SACC ¶ 90.) In Count I, however, 
ATopTech, although incorporating all prior paragraphs, sets forth allegations based solely on the EULA (see SACC ¶ 99-104), 
and in its opposition to the instant motion makes no argument addressing any alleged copyright misuses based on the Milkyway 
Agreement (see Opp'n at 3-7)."
398,6," On May 8, 2015, at the hearing conducted on Synopsys' motion to dismiss ATopTech's First Amended Counterclaims, the 
Court dismissed each of ATopTech's counterclaims with leave to amend. "
399,7, ATopTech does not allege that it previously cooperated with or received any technical assistance from Magma.
399,8," Original equipment vintage tires ""bear the trademarks of tires which originally were sold on vintage cars."" Id. at 1230. "
400,9," Indeed, the motivation for one company's decision to acquire another may have nothing to do with an intent to continue the 
acquired company's product, including, but again not limited to, a need to expand production facilities, a need for 
additional [*17]  skilled labor or technical expertise, or an interest in increasing market share in another geographical area."
400,10," Section 2.9(f), as noted above, provides that customers using PrimeTime ""may not (and may not allow anyone else to): use 
[PrimeTime] or its output to develop or enhance any product that competes with a Synopsys product."" (See SACC ¶ 90.) "
401,11," As noted, ATopTech references both the EULA and Milkyway Agreement in the SACC's Factual Background section. Although 
in Count III, in contrast to Count I, ATopTech does allege that both agreements unlawfully restrain trade (see SACC ¶ 122), in its 
opposition ATopTech makes no argument referencing the Milkyway Agreement as support for its § 1 claim (see Opp'n at 12-15)."
401,12," In light of the above, the Court does not address herein the parties' dispute as to whether PrimeTime outputs are covered by 
Synopsys' copyright."
401,13," Although ATopTech brings its tying claim under both § 1 of the Sherman Act and § 3 of the Clayton Act, the Court need only 
conduct one analysis, as ""the standards used by the two statutes are the same."" See Jefferson Parish Hospital District No. 2 v. 
Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 23 n.39, 104 S. Ct. 1551, 80 L. Ed. 2d 2 (1984). "
402,14," In light of the above, the Court does not address herein the parties' dispute as to whether ATopTech's tying claim requires an 
allegation that the alleged discount results in prices below Synopsys' costs. See Cascade Health Solutions v. PeaceHealth, 
515 F.3d 883, 915 (9th Cir. 2007) (declining to answer ""the question of whether, to establish the coercion element of a tying 
claim through a bundled discount, [plaintiff] must prove that [defendant] priced below a relevant measure of its costs""). "
403,15, Such failure similarly forecloses Synopsys' attempted monopolization claim.
403,16," In the SACC, ATopTech also alleges Synopsys ""has used and attempted to use its assertion of copyright claims as a 
competitive weapon by falsely asserting to customers of ATopTech that ATopTech is engaging in unlawful conduct and that 
ATopTech will not be able to continue as a viable supplier of place-and-route software"" (see SACC ¶ 94) and by ""filing 
objectively baseless litigation"" (see SACC ¶ 152). As Synopsys points out, however, said allegations lack any factual support, let 
alone, as to the alleged false statements, facts sufficient to comply with Rule 9(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. "
404,17," For the same reason, Synopsys' claim for attempted monopolization of the placeand-route market likewise fails."
404,18," At the time, the federal government licensed only two companies to provide cellular services in the area. Id. at 169. "
405,19," In light of the above, the Court does not address herein the parties' dispute as to the elements of an unclean hands defense. "
408,1," Plaintiff refers to these five states as the ""northeastern United States"" without any justification for that definition. See Dkt. No. 
15 at ¶ 16. Plaintiff does not definitely state in the complaint that it sells and ships water to only these five states, but it indicates 
that Plaintiff does not account for all states of competition in every allegation of the complaint. See Dkt. No. 15 at ¶ 46. "
413,2," ""A hallmark of the requisite competitive injury [in secondary-line cases]. . . is the diversion of sales or profits from a disfavored 
purchaser to a favored purchaser"" of a discriminating seller. Volvo Trucks, 546 U.S. at 177. Therefore, the disfavored purchaser 
and favored purchaser must be in direct competition with one another. See G.L.M. Sec. & Sound, Inc. v. LoJack Corp., No. 10-
CV-4701, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 142549, 2012 WL 4512499, *11 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 28, 2012). In tertiary-line cases, the customers 
of the favored and disfavored purchasers can show their injury through diverted sales; but, however, the favored and disfavored 
purchasers do not have to be direct competitors. See Falls City Indus., Inc. v. Vanco Beverage, Inc., 460 U.S. 428, 437-38, 103 
S. Ct. 1282, 75 L. Ed. 2d 174 (1983); G.L.M. Sec. & Sound, Inc., 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 142549, 2012 WL 4512499, at *11."
413,3," In the Second Circuit, the appropriate measure of cost in predatory pricing cases is average variable cost, as a surrogate for 
marginal cost, because marginal cost cannot be determined from conventional accounting methods. See Northeastern Tel. Co. 
v. Am. Tel. and Tel. Co., 651 F.2d 76, 88 (2d Cir. 1981) (adopting marginal cost as the appropriate measure of cost in predatory 
pricing cases). ""Marginal cost is the increment to total cost that results from producing an additional increment of output. It is a 
function solely of variable costs. . . . Marginal cost usually decreases over low levels of output and increases as production 
approaches plant capacity."" Phillip Areeda and Donald F. Turner, Predatory Pricing and Related Practices Under Section 2 of 
the Sherman Act, 88 HAR. L. REV. 697, 700 (1975). "
414,4," The practice of ""dummy brokerages"" occurred when ""large retail buying groups — such as large grocery store chains, which, 
unlike smaller stores, did not need to use intermediary brokers to purchase their merchandise — would require suppliers to pay 
fees to ""dummy brokers,"" who then passed the fees on to the large retailer, effectively reducing the price the retailer paid for the 
goods."" Blue Tree Hotels, 369 F.3d at 221. "
417,5," Although the complaint does identify different sizes of bottled water, it is never clear whether all the sizes of bottled water are 
part of the product market. See Dkt. No. 15 at ¶¶ 14-15. "
418,6, Plaintiff does not maintain a separate claim for a violation of the Sherman Act. 
423,1," Wells Fargo requests that the Court take judicial notice of documents pertaining to WSB's status as a federal savings bank, 
WSB's name change to Wachovia, and Wells Fargo's acquisition of Wachovia. (RJN, Exs. A-E.) Wells Fargo also seeks to have 
the Court take judicial notice of the Deed of Trust, the Adjustable Rate Mortgage Note, the Notice of Default, and the Notice of 
Trustee's Sale, and Trustee's Deed Upon Sale that were recorded in connection with the Subject Property. (Id., Exs. F-J.) 
Because these documents are the proper subject of judicial notice, the Court GRANTS Wells Fargo's request. See Fed. R. Evid. 
201(b). "
444,1," Several years into the alleged conspiracy period, Cristal Arabia acquired Millennium, which now is known as Cristal USA, Inc. 
To avoid confusion, this order refers to the parent Cristal company as ""Cristal Arabia"" and to the subsidiary Cristal company as 
""Millennium."""
444,2," Domestic Defendants do not specify the rules under which they seek dismissal of Plaintiffs' claims. As it did with respect to their 
prior motion to dismiss the first amended complaint, the [*7]  Court construes Domestic Defendants' Article III challenge to be a 
motion under Rule 12(b)(1), and their challenge to the sufficiency of Plaintiffs' statutory antitrust standing and factual allegations 
to be a motion under Rule 12(b)(6). See Maya v. Centex Corp., 658 F.3d 1060, 1067 (9th Cir. 2011) HN1[
] (""Though lack of 
statutory standing requires dismissal for failure to state a claim, lack of Article III standing requires dismissal for lack of subject 
matter jurisdiction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1).""). Any future motion brought in this case shall cite to the 
specific rule or statute under which relief is sought. "
446,3," The parties cite California and Maryland state law on piercing the corporate veil to establish personal jurisdiction. The law of 
both states is substantially similar to that articulated by the Ninth Circuit in Ranza, see Hickory Travel Sys., Inc. v. Tui Ag, 213 
F.R.D. 547, 553 n.2 (N.D. Cal. 2003) (California ""uses agency/alter ego analysis to determine whether a court may exercise 
jurisdiction over a defendant.""); [*16]  Mylan Labs., Inc. v. Akzo, N.V., 2 F.3d 56, 61 (4th Cir. 1993) (discussing Maryland's test "
447,," for piercing the corporate veil for jurisdictional purposes), although Maryland law may be more restrictive, see Haley Paint Co. v. 
E.I. Dupont De Nemours & Co., No. 1:10-cv-00318, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46875, 2012 WL 1145027, at *3 (D. Md. April 3, 
2012) (""Maryland generally is more restrictive than other jurisdictions in allowing a plaintiff to pierce the corporate veil.""). Thus 
application of California or Maryland law would not alter the Court's analysis significantly and would not result in a different 
determination on the issue of personal jurisdiction. "
449,4," Plaintiffs request that the Court take judicial notice of the documents attached to Ms. Van Dyck's declaration, including a 
declaration of John Hall filed in the Maryland direct purchaser action; copies of a publication issued by Cristal Global called the 
Cristal Globe; printouts of Cristal Global's website from June 2008; a news article from 2007; press releases from 2008; and the 
purchase agreement under which Cristal Arabia acquired Millennium. HN9[
] A district court may take judicial notice of ""a fact 
that is not subject to reasonable dispute because it: (1) is generally known within the trial court's territorial jurisdiction; or (2) can 
be accurately and readily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned."" Fed. R. Evid. 201(b). 
Some of the documents attached to Ms. Van Dyck's declaration do not fit within this definition, for example, Mr. Hall's declaration 
and the [*25]  Millennium purchase agreement. However, HN10[
] when considering a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(2), the Court may consider evidence submitted by the parties. See Unocal, 248 F.3d at 922; Data 
Disc, Inc. v. Systems Tech. Associates, Inc., 557 F.2d 1280, 1285 (9th Cir. 1977). Thus although judicial notice is not the 
appropriate vehicle for considering these documents, the Court has considered them in connection with Cristal Arabia's Rule 
12(b)(2) motion. "
452,5," At the hearing, Cristal Arabia's counsel argued that the purposeful direction [*36]  test applies only in tort cases and thus is not 
applicable here because an antitrust claim is not a tort. Hrg. Trans. 15:20-16:14. Given the Ninth Circuit's application of the 
purposeful direction test to antitrust claims in In re Western States, the Court is satisfied that the test is appropriate here. "
456,6," The SAC alleges expressly that each of the named Plaintiffs bought paint, with the exception of Plaintiff Stockman 
Development Inc. dba Stockman Farm Supply. See SAC ¶ 25. "
458,7," As the Court noted at the hearing, if one were to bake a cake using two cups of flour, the presence of flour in the cake might 
not be apparent viewing the finished dessert, but someone with the recipe easily could determine how much flour is in the cake. 
See Hrg. Tr. 31:22-24, ECF 156. "
459,8," For ease of reference, the District of Columbia is referred to as a ""state"" herein. "
460,9," Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 97 S. Ct. 2061, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1977). "
461,10," This Court previously applied AGC to analysis of claims under California's Cartwright Act based upon a state appellate court 
decision, Vinci v. Waste Mgmt., Inc., 36 Cal. App. 4th 1811, 1814, 43 Cal. Rptr. 2d 337 (1995), and a Ninth Circuit decision, 
Knevelbaard, 232 F.3d at 989. See Order Granting Motion to Dismiss in Part, With Leave to Amend at 10, ECF 105. In 
Knevelbaard, the Ninth Circuit simply applied AGC to the Cartwright Act without discussing the reasons for doing so. 
Knevelbaard, 232 F.3d at 987-91. Thus that decision gives no indication what the California Supreme Court would do. In Vinci, a 
state appellate court applied AGC based upon general observations that ""the Cartwright Act has objectives identical to the 
federal antitrust acts,"" and that in the past California courts construing the Cartwright Act have looked to cases construing 
federal antitrust laws for guidance. Vinci, 36 Cal. App. 4th at 1814 n.1. Almost two decades later, however, the California 
Supreme Court clarified that ""[i]nterpretations of federal antitrust law are at most instructive, not conclusive, when construing 
the Cartwright Act, given that the Cartwright Act was modeled not on federal antitrust statutes but instead on statutes enacted by 
California's sister states around the turn of the 20th century."" Aryeh v. Canon Bus. Solutions, Inc., 55 Cal. 4th 1185, 1195, 151 
Cal. Rptr. 3d 827, 292 P.3d 871 (2013). The California Supreme Court [*69]  recently reiterated that statement in In re Cipro 
Cases I & II, 61 Cal. 4th 116, 142, 187 Cal. Rptr. 3d 632, 348 P.3d 845 (2015). In light of the California Supreme Court's 
repeated instruction that federal antitrust law does not control interpretation of the Cartwright Act, this Court concludes that the 
California Supreme Court would not find the rationale set forth in Vinci persuasive and would not apply AGC. Accord Capacitors, 
2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 68615, 2015 WL 3398199, at *13-14 (concluding that AGC does not apply to Cartwright Act); Ion 
Batteries, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 141358, 2014 WL 4955377, at *10-11 (same); cf. Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. v. Panasonic 
Corp., 747 F.3d 1199, 1205 n.4 (9th Cir. 2014) (recognizing that Cartwright Act is not coextensive with Sherman Act). "
462,11," In addressing Plaintiffs' claims brought under state consumer protection statutes and state unjust enrichment law, the Court 
has followed the organizational structure of Defendants' motion, which groups states together by argued grounds for dismissal. 
There is some potential for confusion, because states are addressed multiple times, and Defendants' motion may be denied on "
463,," some grounds but granted on others with respect to the same state. The Court considered reorganizing its discussion to a state 
by state format to avoid multiple [*73]  rulings as to the same state, but ultimately decided that it is more appropriate to address 
Defendants' arguments in the order they selected in their briefing. "
468,12," Arkansas, Arizona, California, District of Columbia, Florida, Iowa, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, 
Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, and South Carolina. "

471,15," Arizona, Florida, Massachusetts, Minnesota, and Tennessee. "
481,1," The Honorable Ann D. Montgomery, United States District Judge for the District of Minnesota."
481,2," Because this case was disposed on a motion to dismiss, we state the well-pled facts as alleged in the complaint. See Zayed v. 
Assoc. Bank, N.A., 779 F.3d 727, 730 (8th Cir. 2015). "
482,3," The district court also denied Insulate's request for injunctive relief on its federal antitrust claims. We do not reach the district 
court's statute of limitations decisions. "
483,4," On appeal, Insulate asks this court to take judicial notice of a number of documents concerning the FTC and Gama actions—
including the FTC complaint and related documents, the district court's order denying summary judgment to Graco in the Gama 
suit, and a transcript of a deposition taken in the Gama suit—that Insulate believes are ""supportive of the plausibility of [its] 
claims."" HN5[
] Federal Rule of Evidence 201(b) allows this court to take judicial notice of public documents for the purpose of noting undisputed adjudicative facts, but judicial notice is inappropriate to the extent Insulate offers these documents for the 
""truth of the matters within them and inferences to be drawn from them—matters which [Graco] disputes."" Kushner v. Beverly 
Enters., 317 F.3d 820, 832 (8th Cir. 2003). We thus grant Insulate's motion [**9]  for judicial notice of these documents to the 
extent we note the existence of and basic facts surrounding these actions, but we decline to consider the documents as 
evidence Graco actually engaged in any anticompetitive conduct alleged therein. Insulate's motion to supplement the record is denied."
483,5," Insulate also brought a price-fixing claim against all defendants and monopolization and unlawful acquisition claims solely 
against Graco but has expressly abandoned these claims on appeal. "
484,6," Insulate's complaint states the appellees entered into both an overarching hub-and-spoke conspiracy and multiple small 
conspiracies between Graco and each of its distributors. The parties dispute whether Insulate adequately alleged a hub-and-
spoke conspiracy. Because we conclude Insulate's complaint does not sufficiently allege any conspiracy—whether widespread 
or on an individual basis—we do not reach this issue. "
485,7," Insulate additionally references Graco's dealings with the FTC, suggesting we should infer Graco's wrongdoing from the FTC's 
investigation and consent agreement. The FTC's complaint, however, alleged Graco unlawfully acquired competitors under 
Clayton Act Section 7, conduct not relevant to the conspiracy claims alleged here. Further, the FTC consent agreement explicitly 
stated Graco had made no admission of guilt. We thus decline to presume Graco violated federal antitrust laws based on [**18]  
the mere existence of this settlement of a different antitrust dispute. "
486,8," HN14[
] Minnesota law differs from federal law in one material respect: Minnesota allows indirect purchasers to sue 
manufacturers for antitrust violations. See Lorix, 736 N.W.2d at 626-27. Minnesota still imposes some ""prudential limits"" on 
antitrust plaintiffs, including a showing of proximate cause. Id. at 631. Assuming Insulate has alleged an anticompetitive 
agreement between Graco and Foampak, Insulate still lacks standing under Minnesota law to challenge this agreement because 
it only purchased FSE from Intech and has not pled any injury traceable to a Graco-Foampak conspiracy. To the extent Insulate 
alleges in its brief a Minnesota monopolization claim against Graco individually, there is nothing in the pleadings or record 
mentioning this claim, and we will not consider that claim for the first time on appeal. See Horras v. Am. Capital Strategies, Ltd., 
729 F.3d 798, 803 n.3 (8th Cir. 2013). "
495,1," The substantive allegations of the DPP CAC parallel the allegations of D. 92, the End-Payor Plaintiffs' Consolidated Amended

497,2," In evaluating a motion to dismiss, a court may consider documents attached to the complaint or expressly incorporated therein. 
Watterson v. Page. 987 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1993). A court may also consider certain documents not attached to the complaint, 
including documents the authenticity of which are not disputed by the parties, official public records, documents central to 
plaintiffs' claim and documents sufficiently referred to in the complaint. Id. "
498,3," Medicis and Impax had already executed the Impax LSA by this time. Impax served the Paragraph IV notice to preserve its

508,6," The First [*58]  Circuit recently affirmed the district court's subsequent order certifying a class of end-payor plaintiffs. 777 F.3d 
9 (1st Cir. 2015). Defendants argued that the certified class included members who were not injured by the alleged foreclosure 
of generic competition because some brand-loyal consumers would have continued to purchase brand-name Nexium even if 
there had been a generic version on the market. Id. at 17. The First Circuit held that class certification is permissible even if a 
class includes a de minimis number of uninjured parties as long as a mechanism exists for establishing injury at the liability 
stage of the case. Id. at 19-20, 25. The First Circuit also held that the named plaintiffs had standing because they had 
established that they ""were overcharged for at least one Nexium transaction during the class period"" and [t]o the extent that it is 
necessary that each and every member of the class who secures a recovery also has standing, the requirement will be 
satisfied—only injured class members will recover."" Id. at 32. "
512,7," Defendants make the same argument as to the Kansas and Tennessee consumer protection claims, but these claims fail for 
the reasons noted above. "
513,8," Defendants make the same argument as to the laws of Georgia and Pennsylvania, but, as discussed above, these unjust 
enrichment claims fail independently because these states follow the Illinois Brick rule. "

536,2," The present action is distinguishable from those cases against Uber in which federal court jurisdiction is based on federal 
question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331. See, e.g., Yellow Group LLC v. Uber Technologies, Inc., No. 12 C 7967, 2014 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 94093, 2014 WL 3396055 (N.D. Ill. July 10, 2014) (in which the plaintiffs alleged claims arising under the Lanham 
Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1051, et seq., and the parallel state law); Boston Cab Dispatch, Inc., et al. v. Uber Technologies, Inc., Civ. A. 
No. 13-10769-NMG, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 42068, 2014 WL 1338148 (D. Mass. Mar. 27, 2014) (in which the plaintiffs alleged 
violations of the Lanham Act, the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (""RICO""), 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961, et seq., 
and various state claims sounding in false advertising, unfair competition, and torts); and Greenwich Taxi, Inc., et al. v. Uber

(in which the plaintiffs alleged violations of the Lanham Act, RICO, and state law claims of unfair competition and tortious 
interference with contractual relationships). As noted supra, the sole basis for this Court's jurisdiction is diversity jurisdiction 
under 28 U.S.C. § 1332."
536,3," Plaintiff Super Taxi, Inc. a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Illinois. Id. ¶ 36. Super Taxi is the ""parent 
corporation of the Plaintiff Cab Companies and Plaintiff Cab Associations, with the exception of Barwood."" Id. Plaintiff Green 
Tomato Cars, D.C., LLC (""Green Tomato"") is organized under the laws of the District of Columbia, with its principal place of 
business in Washington, D.C. Id. ¶ 20. "
537,4," Plaintiffs assert Count IV only against Uber, and not the Driver Defendants. See id."
537,5," As noted supra, Super Taxi is not the parent corporation of Plaintiff Barwood. "
539,6," Plaintiff Super Taxi, a resident of Delaware and Illinois, is also a non-diverse party, as it shares its place of incorporation—
Delaware—with Uber. As Defendants failed to eliminate any possibility that Plaintiffs' claims could succeed against the Driver 
Defendants, this Court need not consider the jurisdictional effects of the non-diverse Super Taxi. The presence of the non-
diverse Driver Defendants is sufficient to deny this Court of subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1332. "

543,1," Anderson argues that its January statements were ""invitations to negotiate"" or a ""proposal,"" not demands or ultimatums. The 
outcome of this action does not depend on how past conduct is labelled, but rather, on the conduct and behavior itself. "
544,2," ProLogix East was a joint venture between Anderson Services and the logistics affiliate of Anderson's competitor The News 
Group. ProLogix East provided magazine delivery services to retailers in the southeast United States. "
545,3," In April 2009, Anderson Services executed an Assignment for the Benefit of Creditors that named Lloyd Whitaker as the 
Assignee. Whitaker was certified as Assignee for the Benefit of Creditors in May 2009, and replaced Anderson Services as a 
named Plaintiff in the Amended Complaint. Am. Compl. ¶ 23. In addition, Hearst Communications, Inc. (""Hearst"") was named as a Defendant in the Amended Complaint, as successor-in-
interest to Hachette. Id. ¶ 14."

Plaintiffs' ""Additional Genuine Issues of Material Fact"" appear as ""Anderson Opp. ([Defendant]) ¶    ."" "
546,5," Although they are referred to as ""distributors,"" these Defendants did not physically distribute magazines to retailers. Time ¶ 6. 
Rather, they worked on behalf of publishers to arrange for distribution of publishers' magazines, and provided the various other 
services set forth on p. 5, supra. "
547,6," There are other cost shifts associated with SBT as well. The term ""shrink"" refers to the difference between the number of 
magazines actually [**16]  sold and the number that are stolen or improperly scanned at the register. Id. ¶ 37. Under the 
traditional method, retailers bear the cost of shrink because wholesalers refund them only for the ""unsold"" magazines that 
wholesalers physically retrieve from stores. The SBT method permits retailers to shift the costs of ""shrink"" to wholesalers, 
because retailers purchase from wholesalers only those magazines that are scanned as sold—which do not include stolen or 
improperly scanned magazines. Time ¶ 59; Anderson Opp. (Curtis) ¶ 37. "
548,7, ProLogix East and West also provided various logistics services for other clients. Id. ¶¶ 40-41. 
549,8," Anderson insists that Charles Anderson's announcement of the surcharge was an invitation to negotiate, rather than a 
unilateral demand, even going so far as to hire an expert to testify that Anderson intended the price increase and inventory cost 
shift to be negotiable. See Subramanian Report ¶ 105. Not only is the proposed expert testimony impermissible under Fed. R. 
Evid. 702, see Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Defendants' Motions to Exclude Expert Testimony, but it is also 
unnecessary, because the full transcript of Charles Anderson's telephone conference with John Harrington is available. There is 
no doubt regarding what Charles Anderson said or how he explained the price increase, inventory cost shift, and the effective 
date. In any case, it is ultimately irrelevant whether Charles Anderson's [**23]  words are labelled as a ""demand"" or a ""proposal""; 
what matters is Anderson's conduct following the announcement of the surcharge and cost shift. "
550,9," Anderson disputes that it owed Bauer $16.66 million, but does not dispute that it owed Bauer money at the time it went 
bankrupt. See Anderson Resp. (Bauer) ¶ 619. "
551,10," The evidence indicates that, although Alleger had heard rumors regarding Anderson's proposed surcharge and inventory cost 
shift by January 13, he did not formally learn of Anderson's terms until the January 14 call. Anderson Opp. (Rodale) ¶ 60."
551,11," At oral argument, counsel for Defendants asserted that Hachette agreed to Anderson's seven-cent per magazine price 
increase. Dkt. No. 445, at 57-59. The evidence indicates, however, that at most, Hachette agreed to pay the price increase on a 
""short-term"" basis. See Fritzler Decl., Exs. 97, 98. In fact, on January 30, 2009, Hachette sent Anderson News a letter stating 
that it would not accept either the seven-cent surcharge or the SBT inventory cost shift. Davis Decl., Ex. 515. "
552,12," The Delaware Court issued the TRO orally on February 9, 2009, and the written Order was entered on February 10, 
2009. [**33]  Oral Arg. Tr. at 62. "
555,13," Anderson asserts that ""Rodale personnel had direct contact with high level Anderson personnel"" during this time, but does not 
elaborate on who these individuals are, or what the ""contact"" entailed. Anderson Resp. (Rodale) ¶ 713. "
557,14," Similarly, Jim Gillis, Chief Operating Officer of Source's parent company, testified that, during separate conversations with 
Jacobsen of TWR and Castardi of Curtis, each stated that they sought to create a ""two-wholesaler"" system. Anderson Opp. 
(Curtis) ¶ 98. "
558,15," Anderson News disputes these amounts, but does not deny that it owed Defendants money at the time it exited the market. 
See, e.g., Anderson Resp. (Curtis) ¶ 442."
558,16," One week after oral argument, Plaintiffs were still unable to discover any case support [**53]  for their proposition. Dkt. 447, at 
3. The Second Circuit analysis of the allegations of the amended pleading do not control. The Second Circuit emphasized that 
""the mere fact that an offer of goods or services at a given price may be nonnegotiable does not mean that the offerees, in 
responding to it, cannot violate the antitrust laws."" Anderson News, L.L.C., 680 F.3d 162 at 192. No court has ever held, 
however, that the antitrust laws require businesses to accept a higher price than that which is offered by competitors."
558,17," Plaintiffs seek to bolster their unpersuasive theory using Dr. Marx's expert testimony that it was in each Defendant's 
independent economic self-interest to continue to supply Anderson News with magazines. See Marx Report, ¶¶ 305, 318. Dr. 
Marx, however, provides no analysis to support this conclusion, other than repeating the contents of certain of Defendants' email 
communications. Such testimony is inadmissible under Fed. R. Evid. 702. See Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part 
Defendants' Motion to Exclude Expert Testimony. "
560,18," Plaintiffs concede that there is no evidence that, prior to the announcement of the Anderson price increase and inventory cost 
shift, Defendants conspired against Anderson News. The alleged conspiracy started post-January 12, 2009, and ended when 
Anderson shut its doors on February 9, 2009."
560,19," The meetings, telephone calls, and emails cited in this Order are not exhaustive of those that appear in the parties' papers. 
The Court has, however, considered all communications set forth in Plaintiffs' motions and Rule 56.1 Statements. "
561,20," Plaintiffs have also provided evidence that the ""frequent telephone calls among the . . . Defendants during the period of their 
negotiations with [Anderson News] represented a departure from the ordinary pattern of calls among them."" See Apple, Inc., 791 
F.3d 290, 2015 WL 3953243, at *6 (citation omitted). In particular, Plaintiffs assert that in the month prior to the announcement of 
the Anderson price increase and inventory cost shift, ""defendants exchanged with other defendants who were their competitors, 
or with defendant publishers or national distributors with whom they did not have a publisher-distributor relationship,"" 39 
telephone calls and/or text messages, [**61]  with a total duration of 82.4 minutes. In contrast, from January 12, 2009 through 
February 12, 2009, there were ""120 calls between direct competitor defendant publishers or national distributors, and 36 calls 
between defendant national distributors and non-client defendant publishers,"" with a total duration of 801.1 minutes. Anderson 
Opp. (Curtis) ¶¶ 283-84. Surely it was not a surprise to Anderson that its proposal, made on January 14 during an industry-wide 
telephone conference/interview, would stir up industry dialog."
561,21, DSI acted as a distributor for both AMI and Bauer. Time ¶ 13. 
562,22," Plaintiffs also contend that Defendants sought to conceal their communications. See, e.g., id. ¶ 266 (internal Kable email 
following email exchange with Kable publisher client regarding Anderson price increase and inventory cost shift, stating, ""You 
need to call these guys when they email you.""); ¶ 267 (email from Porti of Curtis responding to request from client regarding 
Anderson proposal, stating, ""No E-mails . . . I am in all day . . . call when you get a moment""). "
565,23," In contrast, Anderson News' competitor Source filed—and was granted—a TRO requiring publishers to continue to supply it 
with magazines on pre-surcharge terms. See Counterclaims, infra. "
566,24," On February 9, the Delaware District Court granted a TRO forcing ProLogix East to reopen and resume distributing TNG's 
magazines. Time ¶ 134. "
574,1," Defendant Blue Sky Studios, Inc. has its principal place of business in Greenwich, CT, but Plaintiffs allege that it is owned by 
Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation, which has its principal place of business in Los Angeles, California. SAC ¶ 22."
574,2," In its initial order granting Defendant's motion to dismiss, the Court granted Defendants' unopposed request for judicial notice, 
ECF No. 76, and took notice of the adjudicative facts contained therein. Defendants requested that the Court take judicial notice 
of the Civil Investigative Demands issued by the Department of Justice; public records from the State of Delaware; the expert 
report of Edward E. Leamer, as filed in In re High-Tech Antitrust Litig., Case No. 11-CV-2509-LHK, ECF No. 856-8; media 
articles regarding the DOJ investigation; and an advertisement published by Plaintiffs' counsel. See United States ex rel.

1125-26 (9th Cir. 2002) (media publications); see also Fed. R. Evid. 201(d). Similarly, in its initial order granting Defendants' motion to dismiss, the Court granted Plaintiffs' unopposed request for judicial 
notice, ECF No. 97 at 37, and took notice of the adjudicative facts contained therein. Plaintiffs requested that the Court take 
judicial notice of two sealing orders from the High-Tech litigation and a media report. [**6]  See Lee, 250 F.3d at 689-90; Von 
Saher, 592 F.3d at 960."
575,3," Plaintiffs aver that Industrial Light & Magic (""ILM"") is a division of Lucasfilm."
575,4," According to Plaintiffs, ILM, Lucasfilm, and Pixar have been owned by Defendant The Walt Disney Company since 2012. SAC 
¶¶ 25-26."
575,5," Disney also ""oversees the operations [**7]  of"" Walt Disney Animation Studios, formerly known as Walt Disney Feature 
Animation. SAC ¶ 29."
575,6," Plaintiffs also allege that ""[t]he relevant Class members do not bring in this complaint any claims against Pixar, Lucasfilm and 
Disney that were released [in High-Tech]."" SAC ¶ 196. "
577,7," Defendants submit that Exhibit F in their request for judicial notice, consisting of Certificates of Corporate Formation and 
Amendment filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, Division of Corporations, [**16]  disproves Plaintiffs' 
allegation that ImageMovers LLC was a party to the joint venture that created ImageMovers Digital. See ECF No. 76. Plaintiffs 
voluntarily dismissed ImageMovers LLC from this action after Defendants filed their motion to dismiss and request for judicial 
notice. Consequently, the Court concludes that ImageMovers's involvement in the purported joint venture is not relevant. "
578,8," Plaintiffs dismissed ImageMovers LLC without prejudice pursuant to a tolling agreement on January 14, 2015. ECF No. 83. "
579,9, Plaintiffs also dismissed Digital Domain 3.0 without prejudice pursuant to a tolling agreement. See SAC at 19 n.3. 
581,10," The Court notes that Defendants submitted the complete email exchange that Plaintiffs cite in the SAC, and that the relevant 
quoted portion reads ""There is a time sensitive recruiting [**30]  question that needs to be a phone conversation."" See ECF No. 
127-1, at 3. While Defendants focus on Plaintiffs' selective quotation, the Court does note that the emails also reference whether 
""everyone is comfortable with . . . efforts made to recruit. This is going to come up a lot and I have been reiterating the sensitivity 
here."" Id. at 2. "
585,11," Defendants' unopposed request for judicial notice is GRANTED, and the Court takes notice of the adjudicative facts contained 
therein. See ECF No. 127. Defendants request that the Court take judicial notice [**45]  of documents incorporated by reference 
into the SAC (emails and deposition testimony quoted in SAC ¶¶ 137, 140), matters of public record (SEC filings, quoted in SAC 
¶¶ 161, 163), and newspaper articles (quoted in SAC ¶ 169). These documents are appropriate for judicial notice. See Knievel v. 
ESPN, 393 F.3d 1068, 1076 (9th Cir. 2005) (HN1[
] documents referenced in complaint but not physically attached); Lee, 250 F.3d at 689-90 (matters of public record); Von Saher, 592 F.3d at 960 (media publications); see also Fed. R. Evid. 201(d). "
590,12," Defendants contend that the Ninth Circuit has not explicitly held that the standard for fraudulent concealment differs in antitrust 
actions. While that may be the case, the [**61]  Court is not persuaded that Guerrero abrogated the long line of Ninth Circuit 
authority finding that affirmatively misleading acts that were also in furtherance of the conspiracy could establish fraudulent 
concealment."
590,13," While not relevant here, the Court does note that silence may be sufficient to show fraudulent concealment where there is an 
affirmative duty to disclose, e.g., a fiduciary duty. Conmar, 858 F.2d at 505 (""Passive concealment of information is not enough 
to toll the statute of limitations, unless the defendant had a fiduciary duty to disclose information to the plaintiff."") (internal citation 
omitted). "
592,14," The Court further notes that Plaintiffs have alleged a variety of other actions that Plaintiffs contend evince affirmative acts to 
conceal on the part of Defendants. As discussed in the factual background, Plaintiffs aver that Defendants would use personal 
emails instead of company emails to communicate about the conspiracy, published codes of conduct or documents that 
""misrepresented the truth about the conspiracy,"" filed misleading SEC documents, and took active steps to conceal the breadth 
and scope of the conspiracy during the High-Tech litigation. See SAC ¶¶ 140, 151-163, 171-182. Defendants contest the truth of 
some of these allegations, and also dispute whether any alleged action or conduct could individually and independently be 
considered misleading or fraudulent. See Mot. at 8-16. However, on a motion to dismiss the Court accepts as true Plaintiffs' factual allegations and makes all reasonable inferences in 
favor of Plaintiffs. See Knevelbaard Dairies v. Kraft Foods, Inc., 232 F.3d 979, 984 (9th Cir. 2000) (HN12[
] In ruling on a 
motion to dismiss, ""the court must presume all factual allegations of the complaint to be true and draw all reasonable [**70]  
inferences in favor of the nonmoving party."") (citation omitted). "
596,15," The Court notes that Plaintiffs are incorrect in attempting to limit Barker solely to Employee Retirement Income Security Act 
(""ERISA"") cases. It is true that the Barker court was interpreting the ""fraud or concealment"" exception in the ERISA statute. 
Barker 64 F.3d at 1401-02. However, the Ninth Circuit held that the ""'fraud or concealment' exception in the statute incorporates 
the common law doctrine of 'fraudulent concealment.'"" Id. at 1402. The Barker court then cited its prior decision in Volk and 
other persuasive authority for the proposition that under the common law doctrine of fraudulent concealment, a plaintiff must 
""generally"" allege fraudulent concealment as to each defendant. Id. "
599,16," Indeed, to the extent Blue Sky relies on its own apparent ""repeated efforts"" to recruit from competitors, or George Lucas's 
deposition testimony that Lucasfilm did not have an agreement with Blue Sky, the Court notes that these are factual disputes as 
to the truth of Plaintiffs' claims, not the sufficiency of Plaintiffs' allegations. As the Court is required to accept as true Plaintiff's 
factual allegations and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of Plaintiffs on a motion to dismiss, the Court finds that Plaintiffs 
have sufficiently alleged a plausible claim for relief. See Knevelbaard, 232 F.3d at 984. "
602,17," Defendants request, in passing, that the Court ""dismiss or strike"" Plaintiffs' wage-fixing claim. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 
8(b)(3) requires a party to state ""a demand for the relief sought, which may include relief in the alternative or different types of 
relief."" HN22[
] Rule 12(f) permits a court to ""strike from a pleading . . . any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f). A matter is immaterial if it ""has no essential or important relationship to the claim for relief or the 
defenses being pleaded."" Fantasy, Inc. v. Fogerty, 984 F.2d 1524, 1527 (9th Cir. 1993), rev'd on other grounds, 510 U.S. 517, 
114 S. Ct. 1023, 127 L. Ed. 2d 455 (1994). A matter is impertinent if it consists of statements that do not pertain to and are not 
necessary to the issues in question. Id. Redundant allegations are those that are wholly foreign to the issues involved or the 
needless repetition of allegations. Sliger v. Prospect Mortg., LLC, 789 F. Supp. 2d 1212, 1216 (E.D. Cal. 2011). As the Court 
finds that Plaintiffs have sufficiently pled a per se antitrust claim based on Defendants' alleged [**107]  conspiracy to suppress 
employee compensation, the Court DENIES Defendants' request to strike. "
606,*, This disposition is not an opinion of the full Court and pursuant to I.O.P. 5.7 does not constitute binding precedent.
606,1," Between 2006 and 2008 over 27,000 surgeries were performed at Conemaugh Hospital. During the same period, only 7,184 
surgeries were performed at Somerset Hospital."
606,2," In other words, in 2005, nearly 44% [**3]  of the patients in Somerset Hospital's primary service area obtained general surgery 
services elsewhere. "
607,3," Novak also brought various state law claims, [**4]  over which the District Court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction 
and which it dismissed without prejudice. That decision is not before us on appeal."
607,4," The District Court had jurisdiction over Novak's federal antitrust claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331. We have jurisdiction 
under 28 U.S.C. § 1291. HN1[
] We review the District Court's grant of summary judgment de novo and review the facts in the 
light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Burns v. Pa. Dep't of Corr., 642 F.3d 163, 170 (3d Cir. 2011). We will affirm if our 
review reveals that ""there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of 
law."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). "
608,5," As an example, when Somerset Hospital placed a moratorium on certain bariatric surgeries, Novak moved all of his bariatric 
surgeries to Conemaugh Hospital. "
614,*," Pursuant to 5TH CIR. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except 
under the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH CIR. R. 47.5.4. "
615,1," The state appellate court vacated one of the turnover orders because it was entered in violation of a bankruptcy stay, Black, 
443 S.W.3d at 179-80, and reversed the remaining two orders because the trial court issued them without first receiving any 
evidence, id. at 180-81. The court remanded for the trial court to apply proper procedures to Shor's requests for the remaining 
two turnover orders. See id. at 181-82."
615,2," The doctrine [**7]  is named for the two Supreme Court cases from which it is derived: Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 263 U.S. 
413, 44 S. Ct. 149, 68 L. Ed. 362 (1923), and D.C. Court of Appeals v. Feldman, 460 U.S. 462, 103 S. Ct. 1303, 75 L. Ed. 2d 
206 (1983). "
617,3," For instance, an abuse-of-process claim complaining about no more than a creditor's good-faith (but novel) legal argument—
successfully obtaining a state-court judgment that is ultimately overturned on appeal—in the absence of any allegations of fraud 
or other misconduct may not necessarily avoid a Rooker-Feldman bar. "
622,1," KLA also moved to [*5]  dismiss Xitronix's case for failure to allege fraud on the PTO. The Court denied that ground as well, but 
the fraud-on-the-PTO allegations are not at issue in KLA's pending motion to amend. "
623,2," The Court notes a few preliminary issues. KLA contends the appropriate appellate court for Walker Process claims is the 
Federal Circuit, and the Court agrees. See Ritz Camera & Image, LLC v. SanDisk Corp., 700 F.3d 503, 504-05 (Fed. Cir. 2012) 
(considering on interlocutory appeal an issue concerning Walker Process standing). The Court also agrees [*7]  with KLA that 
there is no substantive difference in how to analyze a § 1292(b) motion between Federal Circuit law and Fifth Circuit law. In addition, Xitronix argues in its response that KLA's motion to amend was untimely because it was filed more than ten days 
after entry of the Court's order denying KLA's motion to dismiss. Xitronix misreads § 1292(b), which provides a ten-day deadline 
to file an appeal with the court of appeals from the date a district court certifies an order for interlocutory appeal. See 28 U.S.C. § 
1292(b). Section 1292 does not provide a deadline for asking a district court to amend its order to include a certification of an 
issue for interlocutory appeal. In this case, the Court does not find KLA's motion untimely and considers its merits. "
627,3," As highlighted by KLA, the Netflix court goes on to state: ""Enforcement requires some affirmative act which is lacking in the 
pleadings."" Netflix, 506 F. Supp. 2d at 318. The Court finds this statement confusing because the Netflix court recognized the 
standard for the minimum level of enforcement matches the standard for declaratory judgment standing, yet the Netflix court 
cites no legal authority indicating the standard for declaratory judgment standing ""requires some affirmative act."" As such, the 
Court agrees with KLA this specific statement is inconsistent with the Court's order. Nevertheless, the Netflix court's broader 
analysis is otherwise in harmony [*21]  with this Court's order and Unitherm. One statement from a fellow district court that was 
not essential to that court's holding is not sufficient on its own to amount to a substantial ground for difference of opinion on the 
controlling question of law in this case. "
635,1," ""Defendants"" collectively include: Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha and NYK Line North America Inc. (""NYK Defendants""); 
Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha, Ltd. and ""K"" Line America, Inc. (""K-Line Defendants""); Wallenius Wilhelmsen Logistics AS, Wallenius

(""Höegh Defendants""); and Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, Ltd., Mitsui O.S.K. Bulk Shipping (U.S.A.), Inc., and World Logistics Service 
(U.S.A.) Inc. (""MOL Defendants""). The Court notes that a ""settlement in principal"" was reached between certain IPPs and the K-
Line Defendants, (July 23, 2015 Transcript (""Tr."") at 11), and additionally notes that a ""settlement agreement"" was reached 
between IPPs and the MOL Defendants, for which the parties ""request that the Court stay all proceedings as they relate to [the 
MOL Defendants]."" (D.E. No. 272 at 1). The Court nevertheless must necessarily address the consolidated motions, which

638,5," Although this point was addressed directly by DPPs for their claims for damages under the Clayton Act, IPPs incorporated and 
adopted DPPs' arguments with respect to their claims for injunctive relief under the Clayton Act. (D.E. No. 210 at 72-73). "
640,6," ""Chevron deference"" refers to Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 104 S. Ct. 2778, 
81 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1984), which ""directs courts to accept an agency's reasonable resolution of an ambiguity in a statute that the 
agency administers."" Michigan v. E.P.A., 135 S. Ct. 2699, 2701, 192 L. Ed. 2d 674 (2015). Chevron requires courts to conduct a two-step inquiry. Under the first step, ""[w]hen a court reviews an agency's 
construction of the statute which it administers,"" it must ask 'whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question 
at issue."" [Chevron, 467 U.S. at 842]. If Congress has resolved the question, the clear intent of Congress binds both the 
agency and the court."" Id. . . . Under the second step, [*38]  if ""Congress has not directly addressed the precise question at 
issue,"" because ""the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue, the question for the court is whether 
the agency's answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute."" [Id.] at 843. Hagans v. Comm'r of Soc. Sec., 694 F.3d 287, 294 (3d Cir. 2012) (parallel citation omitted). Here, even if for argument's sake 
the first step were satisfied, a clear ""guiding principle"" from the Third Circuit is that ""Chevron deference is inappropriate for 
informal agency interpretations,"" id. at 300 n.14 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted), let alone remarks such as Mr. 
Khouri's that are expressly disclaimed as personal views. (See D.E. No. 219, Ex. C (""My remarks today reflect my personal 
views and thoughts and are not offered as the official position of the United States or the Federal Maritime Commission."")). 
Thus, Mr. Khouri's remarks are clearly not entitled to Chevron deference. "
641,7," Although the Court indicated on the record that it might not consider this argument due to waiver resulting from failure to 
include it in the opposition brief, (see Tr. 148), the Court accepts it and takes it under consideration for purposes of deciding the 
instant motions."
641,8," The Court also notes that other activities that are clearly covered by the Shipping Act (e.g., price fixing) likewise are not 
explicitly included in the ""Prohibitions and Penalties"" chapter. "
642,9," See D.E. No. 209-13, Ex. K to Defendants' Brief in Support of their Motion to Dismiss IPPs Complaints."
642,10," DPPs argue that the Court should ""discount"" arguments made by CSAV and K-Line with respect to the statutory bar against 
private antitrust actions. (See D.E. No. 219 at 7-10). DPPs contend that it would be ""manifestly unjust"" to permit them to raise "
643,," such arguments when the sentencing Judge in the related criminal actions referenced the pending civil actions when ordering no 
restitution. (Id.). The Court agrees with Defendants that merely acknowledging the existence of civil claims during the plea 
agreement does not preclude the arguments here, especially because: (i) the Shipping Act was not addressed as part of the 
criminal proceedings; (ii) CSAV and K-Line did not waive any arguments with respect to the Shipping Act; (iii) even if they 
had [*47]  waived a Shipping Act argument, it would not permit a cause of action that is otherwise prohibited by the statute; (iv) 
there is no indication that approval of the guilty pleas was predicated on civil damages recovery; and (v) plaintiffs can seek 
reparations through the FMC via 46 U.S.C. § 41305. Thus, the Court finds that DPPs have not established that CSAV and K-
Line should be precluded from making arguments with respect to the statutory bar against private antitrust actions. The Court's 
ruling with respect to section 40307(d) applies to CSAV and K-Line. "
645,11," IPPs argue that CSAV and K-Line should be judicially estopped from invoking preemption because they took an ""inconsistent 
position"" when they pleaded guilty to the criminal charges. (See D.E. No. 210 at 63-64). The Court does not agree. Judicial 
estoppel applies only [*55]  if the ""(1) the party to be estopped is asserting a position that is irreconcilably inconsistent with one 
he or she asserted in a prior proceeding; (2) the party changed his or her position in bad faith, i.e., in a culpable manner 
threatening to the court's authority or integrity; and (3) the use of judicial estoppel is tailored to address the affront to the court's 
authority or integrity."" Montrose Med. Group Participating Sav. Plan v. Bulger, 243 F.3d 773, 777-78 (3d Cir. 2001). Judicial 
estoppel is a narrow doctrine because it is ""an extraordinary remedy that should be employed only when a party's inconsistent 
behavior would otherwise result in a miscarriage of justice."" Id. at 784 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). For the 
reasons stated in footnote 10, supra, IPPs have not demonstrated that judicial estoppel applies. Thus, the Court's holding with 
respect to preemption applies to CSAV and K-Line. "
646,12," Notwithstanding IPPs' conclusory position that state antitrust laws would not apply to a filed and effective agreement. (D.E. No. 
270 at 7). "
647,13," IPPs argue that legislative history which addresses the exclusivity of civil remedies under the Shipping Act should be 
characterized as ""misleading."" (See D.E. No. 270 at 16-20). IPPs contend that such comments are ambiguous, and that the 
Court should focus primarily on the statutory text and discount [*63]  ""cherry-picked"" legislative history because the final 
statutory text was the result of hard-won compromise. (Id.). Although it is true that statements of a particular committee cannot 
be said to stand for the view of Congress more generally, so long as these statements are read as a part of the statute and 
Congress's intent as a whole, the Court does not think it improper to consider these portions of the legislative history. ""Courts 
must utilize their judgment to determine what constitutes an unconstitutional impediment to federal law, and that judgment is 
'informed by examining the federal statute as a whole and identifying its purpose and intended effects.'"" Lozano, 724 F.3d at 303 
(quoting Crosby, 530 U.S. at 373 (2000)). "
648,14," Compare 46 U.S.C. §§ 2101-14701 (Subtitle II — Vessels and Seamen), with 46 U.S.C. §§ 40101-41309 (Subtitle IV — 
Regulation of Ocean Shipping). Indeed, Subtitle II does not mention the FMC, and instead references the Department of 
Homeland Security. See, e.g., 46 U.S.C. § 2104 note."
648,15," Because the Court concludes that the state laws at issue conflict with the federal law, it does not address whether field 
preemption applies. See Crosby, 530 U.S. at 374 n.8 (declining to address field preemption after finding of conflict preemption). "

664,5," Plaintiff's harm is therefore distinguishable from the indirect harm in Anza. The plaintiff in Anza alleged a pattern of mail and 
wire fraud engaged in by the defendants to withhold tax revenue from the New York state government. 547 U.S. at 457-58. The 
plaintiff alleged that it was harmed by the fraud only in a manner contingent on the state's harm: the defendants' withholding of 
taxes from the state enabled them to lower prices, and the lowered prices caused the plaintiff to lose business. Id. Here, in 
contrast, Plaintiff has alleged that the Dismissed Defendants conspired to divert contract work to the Ferguson Defendants, 
directly injuring Plaintiff via the loss of contract work. See Bridge, 553 U.S. at 658 (explaining that because ""[i]t was a 
foreseeable and natural consequence of [the RICO defendants'] scheme to obtain more liens for themselves that other bidders 
would obtain fewer liens,"" the alleged loss of liens was a ""direct financial injury"" sufficient [*16]  to satisfy the directness 
requirement). "
668,1," The court does not, for example, analyze all the factual allegations of the thirty-two page First Amended Complaint to ascertain 
whether any specific [*3]  alleged violation might be time-barred, even under the legal framework discussed in this Order. For 
purposes of this appeal, it is enough that some or most of the claims are not barred. Neither the Bankruptcy Court nor the parties 
performed such a detailed review of the facts, and such a fact-based analysis would be well beyond the scope of this 
interlocutory appeal. "
669,2," Section 480-2(a) provides that ""[u]nfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any 
trade or commerce are unlawful."""
669,3," In his Answering Brief, Field notes that, regardless of the disposition of this appeal, its ""common-law claim for wrongful 
foreclosure is subject to a six-year statute of limitation and is not time barred,"" Doc. No. 11, Answering Br. at 1 n.1, and contends 
that ""Deutsche never moved to dismiss that common-law claim below."" Id. The Bankruptcy Court's Order, however, did not 
address a common-law wrongful foreclosure claim, and it is not clear that the FAC actually alleges such a claim, or whether it 
could be construed as such. But, because the court ultimately affirms the Bankruptcy Court's denial of Deutsche Bank's Motion 
to Dismiss, the court need not reach this question. "
670,4," The March 30, 2015 written Order memorialized a March 19, 2015 oral ruling, with the oral ruling explaining the Bankruptcy

670,5," The Hawaii Intermediate Court of Appeals recently applied the occurrence rule to § 480-24(a), albeit in an unpublished

Bank USA, N.A., 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 57739, 2015 WL 1966689, at *7 (D. Haw. Apr. 30, 2015)."
670,6," This court applies the same standard of review applied by an appellate court when reviewing a bankruptcy appeal. See In re 
JTS Corp., 617 F.3d 1102, 1109 (9th Cir. 2010). ""The court reviews the bankruptcy court's findings of fact under the clearly 
erroneous standard and its conclusions of law de novo."" In re Kimura, 969 F.2d 806, 810 (9th Cir. 1992). "
671,7," Although Robert's Hawaii concerned [*13]  unfair methods of competition under HRS § 480-13(a)(1) (rather than a UDAP claim 
under HRS § 480-13(b)(1)), the language in the two sections is nearly identical in relevant respects, and is construed similarly. 
See, e.g., Flores v. Rawlings Co., 117 Haw. 153, 167 n.24, 177 P.3d 341, 355 n.24 (2008) (""Although a different provision, both 
provisions require an 'injury,' and applying the concept of in pari materia, the meaning of injury as interpreted by the court in [Ai 
v. Frank Huff Agency, 61 Haw. 607, 607 P.2d 1304 (1980),] may be of assistance when interpreting HRS § 480-13(b).""). "
673,8," To be clear, this Order does not address the requirements for a claim seeking only injunctive relief under HRS § 480-13(b)(2). 
For example, whether or not the Sumbillos might have been able to file an action seeking only to halt an auction based on any 
defects in the April 21, 2010 Notice has no bearing on Field's claims for damages here."
673,9," Given this conclusion, the court does not determine whether the continuing violation doctrine might also apply. "

will collectively refer to Cole's Wexford and the parties previously dismissed from this case, i.e., Royal Mile Company, Inc., and 
Pamela Lang, as ""plaintiffs."" "
696,2," The factual background is derived from the factual allegations in the proposed third amended complaint, which are accepted as 
true for purposes of deciding the motion for leave to file a third amended complaint. U.S. Express Lines Ltd. v. Higgins, 281 F.3d 
383, 388 (3d Cir. 2002) (""When considering a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, courts accept as true the allegations in the complaint and its 
attachments, as well as reasonable inferences construed in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs.""). "
697,3," In the proposed third amended complaint, plaintiffs alleged the conspiracy ""continued until at least Summer 2008, and likely 
through to the renegotiation of the UPMC-Highmark contract at the end of 2011."" (ECF No. 250-1 at 73 ¶ 3.) In the third 
amended complaint, Cole's Wexford does not allege that the conspiracy ended in summer 2008; rather, Cole's Wexford alleges: The effects of the conspiracy lasted until at least March 2012, and likely to the present day. The conspiracy—and the 
bilateral monopolies the conspiracy conferred on Highmark and UPMC—created steep barriers to entry that prevented 
other insurers from entering the market. The effects of the conspiracy included a long-lasting barrier to other insurers 
forming a competitive provider network that included UPMC's flagship hospitals, UPMC Presbyterian and UPMC 
Shadyside. The effects of the conspiracy also included a longstanding unwillingness on the part of UPMC to offer 
competitive provider contracts and reimbursement rates to insurers who would compete with Highmark. Because of these 
long-lasting effects of the conspiracy, potential competitors such as United and Aetna have struggled, [**14]  and continue 
to struggle, to become viable competitors in Western Pennsylvania. (ECF No. 286 ¶ 229.)"
697,4," Cole's Wexford alleges in support of these allegations: Data from the Compass Lexecon Report indicates the higher statewide market share of Highmark's competitors is a 
reflection of competitor strength outside of the Western Pennsylvania region. The Compass Lexecon Report compared 
insurer market share data at the statewide level to the Western Pennsylvania market. The report concludes that ""shares are 
significantly skewed in the state level data and even more skewed at the local WPA level, suggesting that rivals represent a 
smaller competitive fringe to Highmark and UPMC."" It further states: ""Rivals' shares for the narrower WPA geography ... 
differ considerably from those estimated from state-wide data for each of the insurers, and generally are higher for 
Highmark and lower for rivals [in Western Pennsylvania]."" In particular, Aetna's 14 percent statewide market share drops to 
3 percent for Western Pennsylvania. The Report also emphasizes that ""state-level data tend to [**17]  overstate 
competitors' shares and understate Highmark and UPMC's because [Highmark and UPMC] operate primarily in WPA."" ... "
698,," Highmark's dominance in Western Pennsylvania was not reflected in other markets. The Compass Lexecon Report states 
that Highmark's market share in 2011 was ""substantially lower than 65% in central Pennsylvania and West Virginia where 
the same market survey reports market shares of 28% and 27%, respectively."" (ECF No. 286 ¶¶ 217, 219.)"
698,5," Cole's Wexford alleges in support of these allegations: On July 20, 2010, the Pennsylvania House Insurance Committee held a public hearing on the subject of health insurance 
rate increases. As discussed more fully below, then-Insurance Commissioner Joel Ario testified that an increasing number 
of Highmark's customers were complaining about being charged excessive premium renewal rates after being transferred 
to Highmark's for-profit subsidiary, Highmark Health Insurance Co. (ECF No. 286 ¶ 189.) "
699,6," Injury in fact is one of three requirements for constitutional standing under Article III of the United States Constitution. Township 
of Lyndhurst, N.J. v. Priceline.com Inc., 657 F.3d 148, 154 (3d Cir. 2011) (citing Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560) (noting the three 
requirements of Article III standing are injury in fact, causation and redressability). Highmark's motion to dismiss is based only 
upon the injury in fact requirement. The court's discussion herein is, therefore, limited to whether Cole's [**22]  Wexford set forth 
factual allegations sufficient to plausibly show it suffered injury in fact. "
708,7," Plaintiffs in the proposed third amended complaint defined the small group plaintiff class as: all persons, whether natural or fictitious, who purchased health insurance coverage from, or otherwise paid any premiums 
or portion thereof to, the Highmark Defendants, and whose policies were in effect at any time on or after January 1, 2002. (ECF No. 250-1 ¶¶ 17-18.) "
710,8," The court of appeals for the Eighth Circuit has recognized that ""proof of conspiracy is not proof of common injury."" Blades v. 
Monsanto Co., 400 F.3d 562, 572 (8th Cir. 2005)."
710,9," The court in the opinion dated August 21, 2014, considered whether a class could be defined as ""Highmark customers that 
would have switched their insurance coverage from Highmark to one of Highmark's excluded or marginalized competitors [**59]  
but for the alleged UPMC—Highmark conspiracy."" Royal Mile, 40 F.Supp.3d at 586-87. The court determined that class 
membership in that class as defined would be based upon the class members' say-so, i.e., not administratively ascertainable, 
and, it, therefore, would violate UPMC's and Highmark's due process rights. Id. at 586. "
711,10," Plaintiffs in their submissions with respect to their motion for leave to file the proposed third amended complaint conceded that 
that beginning on March 21, 2012, all insurers—nonprofits [**60]  and for-profits alike—were required to file their group rates 
with the PID. Under those circumstances, any measure of damages based upon health insurance rates charged on March 21, 
2012, and thereafter, would be barred by the filed rate doctrine. "
712,11," Cole's Wexford may be able to prove that members of the class would have stayed with HHIC in the but for world with 
evidence that in the actual world, once UPMC began contracting with Highmark's insurance competitors, prices for health 
insurance were lower than the rates Cole's Wexford paid HHIC, and the members of the class continued to purchase health 
insurance from HHIC. In re Relafen Antitrust Litig., 221 F.R.D. 260, 272 n.10 (D. Mass. 2004) (""The Court assumes that 
consumers who continued to choose Relafen in the actual world would have done so in the but-for world—that is, even if generic 
nabumetone had become available in August 1998 rather than August 2001.""); In re Cardizem CD Antitrust Litig., 200 F.R.D. 
297, 320 (E.D. Mich. 2001) (""Evidence that all or virtually all class members substituted a lower-priced generic for some of their 
Cardizem CD purchases after generics became available gives rise to the inference that they would have similarly done so in the 
but-for world....Likewise, evidence that other class members obtained increased discounts on their Cardizem CD purchases after 
generic entry likewise gives rise to the inference that increased discounts would have been obtained [**65]  in the but-for 
world.""). A class comprised of those individuals may be administratively ascertainable based upon HHIC's records of its 
customers and would not necessarily be based upon the putative class members' say-so. "
713,12," ""When a conspiracy 'contemplates bringing to pass a continuous result that will not continue without the continuous co-
operation of the conspirators to keep it up, and there is such continuous co-operation,' the conspiracy is [**69]  a continuing 
offense."" United States v. Lowery, 409 F.Supp.2d 732, 736-37 (W.D. Va. 2006) (quoting United States v. Kissel, 218 U.S. 601, 
607, 31 S. Ct. 124, 54 L. Ed. 1168 (1910)). The Supreme Court of the United States has explained: [T]he mere continuance of the result of a crime does not continue the crime. United States v. Irvine, 98 U.S. 450, 25 L. Ed. 
193, 3 Am. Crim. Rep. 334. But when the plot contemplates bringing to pass a continuous result that will not continue 
without the continuous co-operation of the conspirators to keep it up, and there is such continuous co-operation, it is a 
perversion of natural thought and of natural language to call such continuous co-operation a cinematographic series of 
distinct conspiracies, rather than to call it a single one. Take the present case[.] A conspiracy to restrain or monopolize 
trade by improperly excluding a competitor from business contemplates that the conspirators will remain in business, and 
will continue their combined efforts to drive the competitor out until they succeed. If they do continue such efforts in 
pursuance of the plan, the conspiracy continues up to the time of abandonment or success. A conspiracy in restraint of 
trade is different from and more than a contract in restraint of trade. A conspiracy is constituted by an agreement, it is true, 
but it is the result of the agreement, rather than the agreement itself, just as a partnership, [**70]  although constituted by a 
contract, is not the contract, but is a result of it. The contract is instantaneous, the partnership may endure as one and the 
same partnership for years. A conspiracy is a partnership in criminal purposes. That as such it may have continuation in 
time is shown by the rule that an overt act of one partner may be the act of all without any new agreement specifically 
directed to that act. Kissel, 218 U.S. at 607-08. The alleged UPMC-Highmark conspiracy set forth in the third amended complaint is a continuing 
conspiracy. In 2002, UPMC and Highmark allegedly agreed to protect each other's market power, and made promises and 
assurances to each other to obtain those results. Their agreement required both defendants to ""remain in business"" and "
714,," ""continue their combined efforts,"" i.e., UPMC refusing to competitively contract with Highmark's insurance competitors and 
Highmark financially hobbling WPAHS, to achieve the aim of their agreement. Id. "
715,13," The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has explained: Mere cessation of activity in furtherance of an illegal conspiracy does not necessarily constitute withdrawal. The defendant 
must present evidence of some affirmative act of withdrawal on his part, typically either a full confession to the authorities or 
communication to his co-conspirators that he has abandoned the enterprise and its goals. United States v. Steele, 685 F.2d 793, 803-04 (3d Cir. 1982)."
715,14," UPMC argues that based upon a newspaper article published on December 19, 2010, and a newspaper article published on 
April 1, 2011, Cole's Wexford's allegations with respect to a conspiracy existing in and around 2011 are ""entirely implausible."" 
(ECF No. 291 at 9 n.1.) UPMC requests the court to consider the newspaper articles as ""matters of public record"" in deciding its 
motion to dismiss. (Id. (quoting Beverly Enters. v. Trump, 182 F.3d 183, 190 n.3 (3d Cir. 1999).) Cole's Wexford argues 
consideration of the newspaper articles is ""inappropriate for consideration on a motion to dismiss, which requires the Court to 
accept as true the factual allegations in the Complaint."" (ECF No. 295 at 12 n. 3.) ""[F]ederal courts have complete discretion to determine whether or not to accept the submission of any material beyond the 
pleadings that is offered [**76]  in conjunction with a Rule 12(b)(6) motion."" 5C CHARLES A. WRIGHT, ARTHUR R. MILLER & MARY 
KAY KANE, FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE § 1366 (3d ed. 2004) (citing inter alia Pryor v. Nat'l Collegiate Athletic Ass'n, 288 
F.3d 548, 559 (3d Cir. 2002); Morse v. Lower Merion Sch. Dist., 132 F.3d 902, 905 (3d Cir. 1997)). The Third Circuit Court of 
Appeals has acknowledged that ""[t]he general rule, of course, is that 'a district court ruling on a motion to dismiss may not 
consider matters extraneous to the pleadings[,]'"" W. Penn Allegheny, 627 F.3d at 97 n.6, but ""[i]t is well-settled that in deciding a 
motion to dismiss, courts generally may consider...matters of public record,"" Beverly Enters., 182 F.3d at 190 n.3. The court—at this stage of the litigation—will not consider the newspaper articles to decide UPMC's motion to dismiss the third 
amended complaint. As the court held in Mill Bridge V, Inc. v. Benton, Civ. Action No. 08-2806, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 113566, 
2009 WL 4639641, at *14 (E.D. Pa. Dec. 3, 2009), ""[n]ewspaper articles are publicly available, but they are not 'matters of public 
record' for purposes of consideration on a motion to dismiss."" The court in In re Astea Int'l Inc. Sec. Litig., Civ. Action No. 06-
1467, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 58238, 2007 WL 2306586, at *8 (E.D. Pa. Aug. 9, 2007), explained: [D]efendants confuse ""publicly available"" with ""public record."" Articles published in accounting journals and law reviews, 
conference call transcripts, see J/H Real Estate Inc. v. Abramson, 901 F.Supp. 952, 955 (E.D.Pa.1995), and company web 
sites, see Moore U.S.A. Inc. v. The Standard Register Co., 139 F.Supp.2d 348, 363 (W.D.N.Y.2001), are not ""matters of "
716,," public record."" See also Pension Benefit Guar. Corp., 998 F.2d at 1197 (noting that a public record includes criminal case 
dispositions, letter decisions of government agencies, and published reports of administrative bodies)."
716,2007," U.S. Dist. LEXIS 58238, [WL] at *8."
716,15," UPMC argues that [**77]  Cole's Wexford does not have ""standing to sue for a conspiracy's effect on market prices, as that 
effect is 'highly effectual.'"" (ECF No 300 at 5 (quoting Mid-West Paper Prods. Co. v. Cont'l Grp., Inc., 596 F.2d 573, 584 (3d Cir. 
1979).) Cole's Wexford, however, is not suing because it was injured by the conspiracy's effect on market prices; rather, it is 
suing because Highmark—pursuant to the alleged UPMC-Highmark conspiracy—charged or caused HHIC to charge Cole's 
Wexford and other members of the putative class supracompetitive rates for health insurance. "
717,16," See the court's opinion dated September 27, 2013, for a full discussion of the genesis of the indirect purchaser rule and the 
co-conspirator exception. (ECF No. 40 at 61-74.) "
718,17," The Third Circuit Court of appeals approvingly cited Royal Printing in Merican, Inc. v. Caterpillar Tractor Co., 713 F.2d 958, 
967 n. 20 (3d Cir. 1983). The Third Circuit Court of Appeals commented: "
719,," [Royal Printing] involved violations of § 1 of the Sherman Act alleged by several small retail businesses against ten of the 
nation's largest manufacturers of paper products. On a motion to dismiss under Illinois Brick, the court held that an indirect 
purchaser could sue for damages when it had made its purchases from a subsidiary or division of a co-conspirator, even if 
the pricing decision of such a subsidiary or division was determined by market forces. 621 F.2d at 326-27 & n. 4. The court 
went on to hold that purchases made through independent wholesalers, however, were barred. Id. at 327-28. The Royal 
Printing decision parallels the exception to Illinois Brick that we recognized in In re Sugar Indus. Antitrust Litig., 579 F.2d 13 
(3d Cir.1979). In that case we held that an antitrust violator cannot evade liability ""by the simple expedient of inserting a 
subsidiary between the violator and the first uncontrolled purchaser."" Id. at 19. While our view of the exception is somewhat 
narrower than that of the Ninth Circuit, [**89]  see Mid-West Paper Prods., 596 F.2d at 589 (violator must dominate 
subsidiary's prices in accordance with the general price fixing conspiracy), the exception in any form is inapplicable to this 
case. In its complaint Appellees admit that OMCO, the direct purchaser in this case, is not a subsidiary of Caterpillar but 
rather an independent dealer. Complaint at ¶¶ 8, 13; app. at 9B, 11B. Thus under either Royal Printing or Mid-West Paper 
Prods., Appellees would be barred by the rule of Illinois Brick. Merican, 713 F.2d at 967-68 n.20."
719,18," As this court explained in its opinion dated September 27, 2013, the Supreme Court of the United States in Bateman held: [A] private action for damages...may be barred on the grounds of the plaintiff's own culpability only where (1) as a direct 
result of his own actions, the plaintiff bears at least substantially equal responsibility for the violations he seeks to redress, 
and (2) preclusion of suit would not significantly interfere with the effective enforcement of the securities laws and protection 
of the investing public. Bateman, 472 U.S. at 310-11. Courts recognize the foregoing two-part test as the applicable test to determine whether a 
plaintiff's federal antitrust claims against its co-conspirator are barred by the complete involvement defense. [**90]  See Wallach 
v. Eaton Corp., 814 F.Supp.2d 428, 437 (D. Del. 2011); see also Sullivan v. Nat'l Football League, 34 F.3d 1091, 1107 (1st Cir. 
1994); Fla. Software Sys., Inc. v. Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp., Civ No. 97-2866, 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15294, 1999 WL

721,19," The Third Circuit Court of Appeals in Johnston v. HBO Film Management, Inc., 265 F.3d 178, (3d Cir. 2001), explained: [**95] [I]n a properly certified class, the claims of the class representatives must be typical of the class as a whole. See 
Prudential, 148 F.3d at 310. In considering the typicality issue, the district court must determine whether ""the named 
plaintiff[s'] individual circumstances are markedly different or ... the legal theory upon which the claims are based differs 
from that upon which the claims of other class members will perforce be based."" Eisenberg v. Gagnon, 766 F.2d 770, 786 
(3d Cir.1985) (internal quotations omitted). This criteria does not require that all putative class members share identical 
claims. Indeed, so long as ""the claims of the named plaintiffs and putative class members involve the same conduct by the 
defendant, typicality is established regardless of factual differences."" Newton, 259 F.3d at 183-84 (citing Barnes v. Am. 
Tobacco Co., 161 F.3d 127, 141 (3d Cir.1998)); Baby Neal, 43 F.3d at 58 (""Commentators have noted that cases 
challenging the same unlawful conduct which affects both the named plaintiffs and the putative class usually satisfy the 
typicality requirement irrespective of the varying fact patterns underlying the individual claims.""). Here, because the claims 
of the plaintiffs and the putative class members all arise from the alleged misrepresentations by the defendants, the claims 
of the plaintiffs are typical of those of the class. Johnston, 265 F.3d at 184."
721,20," UPMC asserts [**96]  that Cole's Wexford ""fail[s] to assert facts in support of the other required elements of a class action"" but 
does not elaborate on its argument. (ECF No. 291 at 14.) The court will, therefore, defer its consideration of the other required 
elements of a class action to the class certification stage of this case."
721,21," Rule 23(g)(3) provides that ""[t]he court may designate interim counsel to act on behalf of a putative class before determining 
whether to certify the action as a class action."" Counsel for Cole's Wexford, however, has not filed a motion for interim 
appointment of class counsel. "
726,1," All ""ECF"" references are to the [*8]  docket of Case No. 11-CV-02509-LHK in the Northern District of California. "
729,2," As suggested above, there was another discrepancy in Class Counsel's filings with the Court. Namely, LCHB requested 
$1,184,810.98 in unreimbursed expenses for Class Counsel, see Class Counsel Mot. at 2, while JSLF requested $1,200,000 for 
the same, see Saveri Supp. Decl. ¶ 14. "
730,3," It appears co-lead Plaintiffs' counsel incorrectly listed JSLF's revised lodestar as ""$3,979,819.25,"" ECF No. 1105 ¶ 10, which 
would represent a reduction of only $2,335,000 from JSLF's previous lodestar of $6,314,819.25."
730,4," Broken down by law firm, the lodestars are: $11,476,957.50 (LCHB); $3,922,509.00 (JSLF); $1,429,225.50 (G&E); 
$1,373,095.50 (B&M). ECF No. 1105 ¶ 10; Saveri Second Supp. Decl. ¶ 6, Ex. 2. "
732,5," (81,125,000 + 5,000,000) / 18,201,787.50 = 4.73"
732,6," The survey actually included 34 settlements, but multipliers are not listed for 10 of them. See Vizcaino, 290 F.3d at 1052-54. "
733,7," (5,071.53 / (3,065,184,307 / (64,466 - 56))) x 100 = 10.65% "
735,8," (40,043,932.50 + 5,000,000) / 18,201,787.50 = 2.47 "
736,9," The Court arrived at this figure through the following calculations. First, the Court had to calculate the remainder based on the 
requests [*47]  for attorney's fees, reimbursement of expenses, and service awards submitted by Plaintiffs' counsel and the 
estimated per class member recovery provided by Plaintiffs' counsel: Remainder = 415,000,000 - ((5,071.53 x (64,466 - 56)) + 
81,125,000 + 4,523,500 + 1,200,000 + (160,000 x 5)) = $694,252.70. The Court then subtracted this remainder, along with the 
Court's awards for attorney's fees, expenses, and service awards, from the $415 million settlement to arrive at the total amount 
of the settlement that would go to the class: Amount to Class = 415,000,000 - 40,822,311.75 - 1,200,000 - 120,000 - (80,000 x 
4) - 694,252.70 = $371,843,435.55. The Court then divided this figure by the 64,410 class members who did not opt out of the "
737,," settlement to arrive at an estimate for the average recovery per class member: Amount Per Class Member = $371,843,435.55 / 
(64,466 - 56) = $5,773.07."
737,10," (40,822,311.75 / 415,000,000) x 100 = 9.84%"
737,11," ((40,822,311.75 + 5,000,000) / 435,000,000) x 100 = 10.53% "
739,12," Although the motions themselves were timely filed, several of Class Counsel's supporting declarations were, as Mr. Zavislak 
points out, filed after midnight on May 8, 2015. Jue Supp. Decl., Ex. N at 3 n.4. Nonetheless, these declarations were all filed 
well in advance of the May 21, 2015 deadline to object and thus comply with In re Mercury Interactive. It is also true that Mr. Saveri's supplemental declaration was filed on May 21, 2015, the date of the objection deadline. See 
Saveri Supp. Decl. However, the Court finds no prejudice to the class because Mr. Saveri's supplemental declaration did not 
change Class Counsel's total request for $81,125,000 in attorney's fees. Rather, the declaration merely informed the Court that 
JSLF's lodestar was lower than what had been previously represented. See id. ¶ 5. The same is true for Mr. Saveri's second 
supplemental declaration filed on July 24, [*56]  2015, which reduced JSLF's lodestar even further. See Saveri Second Supp. 
Decl. ¶¶ 5-6. "
740,13," Service awards are known alternatively as ""incentive [*61]  awards"" or ""incentive payments."" "
758,1," In addition to the MetroPCS pitch, in May of 2010, Plaintiff's vice-president for business development met in Oregon with the 
general manager for OpenMarket, an affiliate of Defendants. Behling Decl. ¶ 3, ECF 79; Haynie Decl. Ex. 3, ECF 83 . At this 
meeting, Plaintiff provided an overview of its payment processing solution. [**8]  Behling Decl. ¶ 5, ECF 79. "
762,2," Although the Merger Guidelines are not binding on courts, they are often used as persuasive authority. Saint Alphonsus Med. 
Ctr.-Nampa Inc. v. St. Luke's Health Sys., Ltd., 778 F.3d 775, 784 (9th Cir. 2015). "
764,3," The following MNOs self-supply and do not outsource their payment processing requirements: AT&T/Cricket, TracFone, U.S. 
Cellular, and Verizon. FAC ¶ 110. AT&T/GoPhone, Sprint, and T-Mobile/MetroPCS outsource their payment processing 
solutions. Id. at ¶ 107. "
765,4," The following brands use either Plaintiff or Defendants for their payment processing services: (1) AT&T/GoPhone; (2) Sprint 
Prepaid; (3) Sprint/boostmobile; (4) Sprint/Virgin mobile; (5) T-Mobile; and (6) T-Mobile/MetroPCS. FAC ¶ 107. "
766,5," At oral argument, Plaintiff's counsel argued that there were all [**34]  kinds of market facts and customer relationships that 
could change between the filing of the complaint and trial. Because Defendants currently have the contract for MetroPCS 
payment processing, Plaintiff's counsel argued that the First Amended Complaint was accurate and must be assessed as 
pleaded. "
770,6," Defendants argue that the same argument applies to the Sprint sale. However, the FAC is more ambiguous as to Sprint. 
Taking the facts as alleged by Plaintiff, the Court finds that they do state that the two products were bundled for sale to Sprint. 
See FAC ¶¶ 82, 86, 107, 111, 130. "
774,7," This Court concluded in a previous Opinion & Order that Oregon law applied to the trade secret claim. See Opinion & Order, 
January 13, 2015, p. 17 (ECF 42). At that stage in this action, Defendants did not dispute that Oregon law applied, but they 
stated that if Plaintiff ""is given leave to amend, and identifies the location of the alleged misappropriation, [Defendants] may 
assert that the law of that state or nation governs."" Defs.' Mot. to Dismiss 17, n. 11. While Plaintiff did amend its complaint to add 
the antitrust claims, Defendants do not point to any new information regarding the location of the alleged misappropriation that 
would justify a new argument from Defendants as to which state law applies. "
781,1," Such licensure is pursuant to the Private Detective, Private Alarm, Private Security, and Locksmith Act of 2004, 225 ILCS 
447/5-5. See R. 76 ¶ 1. "
782,2," Alarm Detection's allegations reference the fees as they were in Orland's agreement with Tyco signed in 2003. See R. 76-3 at 
56 (¶ 4). The current agreement, which took effect in 2014, provides that the ""initial connection fee"" is $200, and the ""monthly 
monitoring fee"" for ""radio transmitted signals"" is $23.50, and for ""dedicated circuits"" is $14. See R. 76-3 at 49 (¶ 4). "
783,3," The 2014 agreement provides that these fees are $14 and $23.50, respectively. See R. 76-3 at 50 (¶ 5). "
789,4," Alarm Detection's allegation that it has been excluded from the market for fire alarm signal services gives it constitutional 
standing to challenge the ordinances pursuant to which Bloomingdale and Lemont allegedly excluded Alarm Detection from that 
market—i.e., the 2002 and 2005 ordinances pursuant to which Bloomingdale and Lemont entered into the subscriber [**30]  
agreements, respectively. "
790,5," Lemont argues that Alarm Detection should be judicially estopped from seeking a declaration that the Lemont and 
Bloomingdale subscriber agreements are void ab initio because Alarm Detection argued in favor of the district court's injunction 
that Lisle-Woodridge's ""subscriber contracts would continue, in force, until the subscribers had converted to a wireless 
transmitter supplied by a private alarm [**33]  vendor of their choice."" R. 97 at 25. Alarm Detection's position in the Lisle-
Woodridge case is not contrary to its position here, because in both cases Alarm Detection advances the position that the 
subscriber agreements are no longer valid and must be divested in favor of agreements each subscriber reaches with a private 
alarm company. Thus, Alarm Detection is not estopped from pursuing these claims. Bloomingdale and Lemont also argue that they have authority to assign the subscriber agreements because Section 10a of the 
District Act provides fire protection districts like Bloomingdale and Lemont with the authority to sell superfluous ""personalty."" 70 
ILCS 705/10a (""The board of trustees of any fire protection district incorporated under this Act may sell, lease or exchange 
personalty . . . owned by the district and no longer needed for fire protection purposes.""). ""Personalty"" is not defined in the 
District Act, but ""personalty"" would include valuable contracts like the subscriber agreements. See Black's Law Dictionary (2d 
pocket ed. 1996) (definitions for ""personalty,"" ""property,"" ""ownership,"" and ""conveyance""). Alarm Detection, however, does not 
appear to challenge Bloomingdale and Lemont's authority to [**34]  assign legally enforceable contracts, but rather only argues 
that the assignments are not valid because Bloomingdale and Lemont lacked authority to enter those agreements. "
791,6," In its brief, Alarm Detection argues that it has stated claims under [**36]  the Alarm Act, 225 ILCS 447/10-5, (as opposed to the 
District Act) because Orland is monitoring fire alarms at its Communications Center without a license. R. 140 at 10, 13. Although 
Alarm Detection alleges in its complaint that ""Defendants' actions . . . violate the licensing requirements of the [Alarm Act], R. 76 
¶ 1, because ""[n]one of the Districts hold licenses under the Alarm Act,"" id. ¶ 176, Alarm Detection does not seek any relief on 
the basis of these allegations. Rather, these allegations are the basis for Alarm Detection's claims that the ordinances adopted 
by Bloomingdale, Lemont, and Orland were without rational basis and thus violate the Fourteenth Amendment. See R. 76 ¶ 332. 
(And as will be discussed below, the Court holds that those claims are untimely.) Since Alarm Detection seeks no relief on the 
basis of an Alarm Act violation, the Court holds that Alarm Detection's complaint does not state a claim on the basis of the Alarm 
Act. Even if Alarm Detection's complaint sought such relief, Alarm Detection's allegations fail to state a claim for violation of the Alarm 
Act. The Alarm Act provides that ""it is unlawful for a person to act as or provide the functions of a . . . private alarm contractor . . . 
or to advertise [**37]  or to assume to act as . . . one . . ."" without a license. 225 ILCS 447/10-5. But as noted above, the 
Seventh Circuit has held that the District Act provides fire protection districts the authority to operate remote supervising stations. 
Since the District Act expressly grants fire protection districts the power to operate remote supervising stations, fire protection 
districts do not need to comply with the Alarm Act's requirements for ""private alarm contractors."" Thus, to the extent that Alarm 
Detection's complaint includes a claim that Orland violates the Alarm Act by operating its Communications Center without a 
license, that claim fails. "
792,7," Orland argues that Alarm Detection is barred from raising claims based on the 2006 ordinance which authorized Orland's initial 
agreement with Tyco under the doctrine of laches. HN7[
] To dismiss a claim under the doctrine of laches, Alarm Detection's 
claim must on its face demonstrate that its delay in challenging Orland's arrangement with Tyco was unreasonable and that 
Orland suffered prejudice due to the delay. See Suggs v. United States, 256 Fed. App'x 804, 806 (7th Cir. 2007) (""Because [the 
plaintiff] did not allege that his delay caused prejudice to the government, the validity of laches was [**42]  not apparent from the 
face of the complaint.""). Alarm Detection's complaint does not allow for such a conclusion, so its claims will not be dismissed on 
the basis of laches. "
793,8," Alarm Detection has filed a motion to strike Defendants' state of limitations argument. See R. 123. That motion is denied for the 
reasons that follow. "
794,9," The parties do not address whether the renewal of the agreements constitute overt acts sufficient to restart the statute of 
limitations. See Xechem, 372 F.3d at 902 (finding that an action taken to extend the five-year exclusivity period for marketing a 
pharmaceutical was sufficient to restart the statute of limitations). This is of no moment, however, because the Bloomingdale 
agreement was last renewed more than four years prior to the date Alarm Detection filed its complaint, and the Lemont 
agreement renewed automatically without any overt action required by Lemont or Cross Points beyond the terms to which they 
agreed in 2002."
794,10," Since the Court has dismissed Counts I, II, IV, and V as they pertain to Chicago Metro and Cross Points as barred by the 
statute of limitations, the Court does not reach Defendants' arguments regarding mootness, laches, immunity, and the 
substantive elements of the Sherman Act, with respect to those Counts and defendants. "
796,11," Moreover, many of the Seventh Circuit's decisions in antitrust cases in the nearly 30 years since Fishman was decided have 
relied on reasoning drawn from Judge Easterbrook's dissent in Fishman, thus calling into question whether Fishman remains 
good law. See JamSports & Entm't, LLC v. Paradama Prods., 336 F. Supp. 2d 824, 835-36 (N.D. Ill. 2004) (citing cases). "
797,12," The foregoing antitrust injury analysis is dispositive of Alarm Detection's claims regarding Tyco's agreements with 
Bloomingdale and Lemont in Counts I, II, IV, V, VII, and VIII, such that the Court does [**59]  not need to reach Tyco's 
arguments with respect to the other elements of the Sherman and Clayton Act claims. The Court notes, however, that much of 
its reasoning with respect to antitrust injury would also apply to whether Tyco engaged in exclusionary conduct or an 
unreasonable restraint of trade, and whether Tyco's actions caused a decrease in competition. "
798,13," Tyco also argues that Alarm Detection has failed to plausibly allege a relevant geographic market. See R. 88 at 24. Tyco's 
arguments on this point focus almost exclusively on its agreements with Bloomingdale and Lemont. Its only argument with 
respect to its agreement with Orland is that Alarm Detection ""nowhere explains how it is that Tyco's municipal contract to 
establish and maintain the fire district's communication center alone constitutes market power or a cognizable barrier to entry."" 
Id. As explained above, Alarm Detection's allegations with respect to Tyco's contract to service Orland's Communication Center 
fail to state a claim. Tyco does not otherwise make an argument that Alarm Detection [**63]  has failed to allege a geographic 
market with respect to Orland, so the Court does not reach this issue. "
799,14," None of the defendants challenge Alarm Detection's allegations that all of them were acting ""under color of law."" "
803,1," These officials are: Liza M. Estrada (""Estrada"") in her official capacity as Administrator of CFSE; Sheila Rivera-Serrano 
(""Rivera-Serrano"") in her personal and official capacity as Director of the CFSE Medical Area; Maria I. Lastra-Gonzalez (""Lastra-
Gonzalez"") in her personal and official capacity as Medical Director at the CFSE Bayamon Regional Office; Jose Colon-Grau 
(""Colon-Grau"") in his personal and official capacity as an External Advisor; and Lorena Diaz-Trancon (""Diaz-Trancon"") in her 
personal and official capacity as a Type VII Internal Medical Council of CFSE."
803,2," The facts in this section were taken from Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint and are presumed to be true for purposes of 
Defendants' motions to dismiss. See Docket No. 28. "
806,3," The Court notes that Defendants did not argue that they were entitled to state sovereign immunity under the Eleventh 
Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. In any event, this Court agrees with the reasoning and holding of Judge Salvador Casellas 
and Judge Gustavo Gelpi that the CFSE is not an ""arm of the State"" for purposes of the Eleventh Amendment and state 
sovereign immunity. See, e.g., Joubert-Vazquez v. Alvarez-Rubio, 820 F. Supp. 2d 289, 298-300 (D.P.R. 2011) (Casellas, J.) 
and Aponte-Ramos v. Alvarez-Rubio, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135050, 2011 WL 5855313, at *1 (D.P.R. Oct. 28, 2011) (Gelpi, J.). "
807,4," Out of these three chiropractic clinics, only Centro Quiropractico de Cayey P.S.C. is not a plaintiff in this case. In addition, 
throughout their sixty-eight page motion to dismiss, Defendants consistently argue that Lopez-Garcia's chiropractic clinic and co-
plaintiff [*16]  in this case, Centro Quiropractico Dr. Juan M. Lopez P.S.C., is not properly registered in the Puerto Rico 
Department of State as an existing and duly incorporated entity. See, e.g., Docket No. 30 at 21 n.12. The Court takes judicial 
notice, however, that the company is registered as ""Centro Quiropractico Dr. Juan M. Lopez, DC P.S.C."" See Department of 
State's 
Corporate 
Registry 
of 
the 
Commonwealth 
of 
Puerto 
Rico, 
available 
at https://prcorpfiling.f1hst.com/CorporationSearch.aspx . Since it is evident that we are talking about the same corporate entity, —
the one that entered into a service provider contract with CFSE and is owned by Plaintiff Lopez-Garcia— the Court will not 
address Defendants' argument any further."
807,5," The First Circuit has recently held that the shareholder standing rule constitutes a prudential factor, as opposed to a 
constitutional requirement, for the courts to consider as part of the standing analysis. See Gianfrancesco v. Town of Wrentham, 
712 F.3d 634 (1st Cir. 2013). In other words, courts may circumvent this rule under certain circumstances to reach the merits of 
the case. Id. "
808,6," It is unclear from the face of the Amended Complaint whether Plaintiffs base their antitrust claims on any other actions besides 
the limitation of chiropractic services through the adoption of the alleged discriminatory guidelines."
808,7," The term ""state action"" should not be confused with our constitutional analysis under the Fourteenth Amendment. Unlike 
Fourteenth Amendment state action, the concept of ""state action"" for antitrust immunity purposes does not cover ""inadvertent or 
unilateral acts of state officials not acting pursuant to state policy."" 1 P. Areeda & H. Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law ¶221, p. 356 
(2d ed. 2000) (Areeda & Hovencamp). "
810,8," For what [*26]  it is worth, Plaintiffs incorrectly referenced the defunct intraenterprise conspiracy doctrine as applicable and also 
failed to identify the correct legal standard. See Docket No. 41 at 10-13."
810,9," This is the extent of Defendants' analysis. The Motion to Dismiss consists of a two-page, boilerplate summary of what the 
defense of qualified immunity entails and a small paragraph indicating that the individual defendants are entitled to this defense. 
Defendants' analysis did not even recognize a distinction between Plaintiffs' antitrust claims under § 1 and § 2 of the Sherman 
Act. See Docket No. 30 at 65."
810,10," Defendants only raised a vague qualified immunity defense as to Plaintiffs' Sherman Act and Fourteenth Amendment claims. 
See Docket No. 30 at 64-66. Nonetheless, Defendants' arguments were unopposed because Plaintiffs only responded to a non-
existent qualified immunity defense with respect to the First Amendment retaliation claim. See Docket No. 41 at 30-31. The 
Court is perplexed at such a degree of carelessness."
810,11," The parties' discussion of this requirement was quite comprehensive. Therefore, the parties may rely on the arguments that 
were already raised. "
811,12," The Court expects the font and margins to comply with Rule 7(d) of the Local Rules of Civil Procedure. Failure to comply with 
such rules shall result in the filing being stricken from the record."
811,13," Defendants claim that Plaintiffs failed to specify which component of the Due Process Clause was allegedly violated. See 
Docket No. 30 at 52-53. As a result, Defendants felt the need to analyze Plaintiffs' allegations under both substantive and 
procedural due process theories. Id. The Amended Complaint, however, clearly states in bold and capital letters that Plaintiffs 
only alleged violations of their substantive due process rights. See Docket No. 28 at 46. Plaintiffs confirmed the obvious in their 
main Opposition. See Docket No. 41 at 20. "
812,14," It is worth noting that this number only refers to the maximum amount of compensated referrals under the CFSE. The adopted 
guidelines at no point prevent injured workers from seeking additional treatment so long as they pay those expenses out of their 
own pocket. See Docket No. 28 at 11."
812,15," This analysis applies with equal force to Plaintiffs' substantive due process claim as it is evidence that the guidelines were 
neither arbitrary nor capricious. This is one of many examples in which equal protection principles prove to be instructive as to 
the applicability and meaning of the due process clause."
812,16," Even if this is not the reason articulated by Defendants when adopting the guidelines, ""[t]he burden is on the plaintiff to 
disprove every conceivable basis which might support the classification, 'whether or not the basis has a foundation in the 
record.'"" Giacalone v. Wehner, 387 F. Supp. 2d 383, 385-385 (S.D.N.Y. 2005) (quoting Heller v. Doe, 509 U.S. 312, 320-321, 
113 S. Ct. 2637, 125 L. Ed. 2d 257 (1993)). "
813,17," While Plaintiffs seem to suggest that the actions giving rise to their equal protection claim was the adoption of the new 
guidelines, the Court notes that the same reasoning applies to the inclusion of ""Attachment A"" to the new contracts. See Docket 
No. 28 at 38-39. Defendants were not required to include the same attachment to the new contracts of other health professionals 
because: (1) there is a rational basis to distinguish chiropractors from the other healthcare providers; and (2) the Equal 
Protection Clause allows Defendants to act one step at a time."
813,18," It is not clear whether Plaintiffs' contracts had already expired or were in fact terminated. On the one hand, Plaintiffs' 
Opposition states that Defendants ""revoked and withdrew the already approved . . . agreements just a few days after Plaintiffs 
filed their Complaint."" Docket No. 41 at 24. According to the Amended Complaint, however, only Plaintiff Roman's contract was 
authorized for renewal and then revoked. See Docket No. 28 at 42-43. The other contracts had already expired and the CFSE 
chose not to extend or renew the service agreements. Id. Therefore, it appears that the alleged retaliatory action in this case was 
the non-renewal [*39]  of Plaintiffs' contracts with CFSE."
813,19," According to Defendants, both the expired and the new proposed contracts included the following no litigation clause: ""The 
Provider certifies that he or she currently has no litigation in process against any instrumentality of the Government of the 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or any of its municipalities."" Docket No. 30 at 60-61. This information was included as an Exhibit 
to the Motion to Dismiss. Id., Ex. 1. Therefore, Defendants essentially ask this Court to look beyond the four corners of the 
Amended Complaint at this early stage of the case. "
814,20," Defendants argue that this no litigation clause ""does not contravene Puerto Rico's laws, morality, or the public order."" Docket 
No. 30 at 62. Defendants, however, fail to explain why or how that is the case. They also fail to cite any authority in support of 
such proposition. Therefore, this is yet another conclusory argument lacking substance."
814,21," Both Del Valle Group and Oscar Renda involved contract bidders that lacked a pre-existing relationship with the state. 
Therefore, if anything, the reasoning in these decisions becomes even more forceful in the instant case where the Complaint 
alleges that Plaintiffs were independent contractors with pre-existing [*41]  contractual relationships."
814,22," Both parties fail to utilize, or even recognize, this three-part inquiry. Once again, the parties ""leav[e] the court to do counsel's 
work, create the ossature for the[ir] argument[s], and put flesh on [their] bones."" See Zannino, 895 F.2d at 17. "
815,23," For some reason the Court will never quite understand, Defendants' Motion to Dismiss seems to confirm that Plaintiffs' original 
lawsuit was the real reason behind the non-renewal of Plaintiffs' contracts. See Docket No. 30 at 60-62. Even more surprisingly, 
Defendants seem to even justify their alleged retaliatory conduct. For example, Defendants state: ""Plaintiffs want to proverbially 
have their cake and eat it too; they want to sue their former contractual partner yet still receive business via the [CFSE's] 
referrals. No individual or private entity would tolerate such behavior and the [CFSE] cannot be expected to do the same . . . ."" 
Id. at 61. This appears to be a truly unwise admission by Defendants that, if taken literally, would seem to confirm Plaintiffs' 
allegations of retaliation."
815,24," Given the ""fact-intensive nature"" of this First Amendment framework for government-employee [*46]  speech, the First Circuit 
has stated that the analysis under the framework's first two prongs ""does not easily lend itself to dismissal on a Rule 12(b)(6) 
motion."" Decotiis, 635 F.3d at 35 (citing Jordan v. Carter, 428 F.3d 67, 73 (1st Cir. 2005)). "
816,25," In their Motion to Dismiss, Defendants correctly noted the Amended Complaint's lack of specificity as to this claim. See Docket 
No. 30 at 59 and Docket No. 44. The Court notes that this [*47]  argument went unopposed as Plaintiffs fell silent in their 
Opposition and continued to lump Defendants together in violation of the standard articulated in Iqbal. See Docket No. 41 at 24-
26. "
817,26," Since Plaintiffs failed to provide any relevant analysis or legal authority in support of their position, it follows that Defendants' 
main argument was basically unopposed. Plaintiffs' only relevant argument is conclusory, lacks legal support, and is devoid of 
any substance. See Docket No. 41 at 28 (""The above summarized acts are not merely the enforcement of already-existing 
regulations, but rather delve into a wide array of powers delegated to Defendants by . . . Act No. 45 . . . .[and, thus,] such 
actions [*52]  are to be considered an exercise of ""legislative power"" that the Contracts Clause is specifically designed to 
police."")."
817,27," The Court also notes that it is not entirely clear that the challenged guidelines substantially impaired Plaintiffs' contractual 
obligations with the CFSE. It would seem that what Plaintiffs are really alleging is the impairment of their contracts' performance. 
See Docket No. 28 at 33-34. This issue was neither raised nor briefed by either party. But, to the extent that the Complaint really 
alleges an impairment of the performance of the contracts, Plaintiffs' claim should also be dismissed because it would not 
implicate the Contract Clause and our Constitution does not provide a federal action for simple breach of contract. "
821,1," This action is instituted under §§ 4 and 16 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 15 and 26 to recover treble damages, amongst 
other fees and costs, for injuries sustained by Plaintiffs and members of the putative class for Defendants' alleged violations of § 
1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1."
821,2," As in all cases, as this case proceeds, further information may come to light or a change in circumstances may occur which 
requires modification of the methodology employed to effectively and efficiently resolve the pending issues related to this matter. "
823,3," Parties dispute whether Wilmington Steel Processing, Co. retained possession of its antitrust claims after it sold ""substantially 
all of its assets"" to first, Concord Steel in September 2006 and then, new business assets to VR Laser Services USA, Inc. in May 
2008. Because Wilmington Steel did not expressly transfer its antitrust claims, it retains its antitrust claims. See Franco v. Conn. 
Gen. Life Ins. Co., 818 F. Supp. 2d 792, 812 (D.N.J. 2011); Gulfstream III Associates, Inc. v. Gulfstream Aerospace Corp., 995 
F.2d 425, 440 (3d Cir. 1993) (""any assignment of antitrust claims, as a matter of federal common law, must be an express 
assignment""). "
833,1," Having read and considered the papers presented by the parties, the Court finds this matter appropriate for disposition without 
a hearing. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 78; Local Rule 7-15. Accordingly, the hearing set for September 21, 2015 at 1:30 p.m. is hereby 
vacated and off calendar. "
834,2," The elements of a claim for monopolization are ""(a) the possession of monopoly power in the relevant market; (b) the willful 
acquisition or maintenance of that power; and (c) causal antitrust injury."" Allied Orthopedic Appliances Inc. v. Tyco Health Care 
Group LP, 592 F.3d 991, 998 (9th Cir. 2010). The elements for a claim for attempted monopolization are: ""(1) specific intent to 
control prices or destroy competition; (2) predatory or anticompetitive conduct to accomplish the monopolization; (3) dangerous 
probability of success; and (4) causal antitrust injury."" Portney v. CIBA Vision Corp., 593 F. Supp. 2d 1120, 1125-26 (C.D. Cal. 
2008). The parties dispute whether PAC actually has monopoly power in the Games Market (in the context of the monopolization 
claim), whether PAC's use of its preferred list or its alleged disparagement of G.U.E. amount to predatory or anticompetitive 
conduct (in the context of the attempted monopolization claim), and whether PAC has a dangerous probability of success in 
monopolizing the Games Market (in the context of the attempted monopolization claim). Because the Court determines that PAC 
does not compete in the Games Market—a prerequisite to liability under either theory, as explained below—it need not reach the 
question of whether other elements of either claim are met."
834,3," The Court DENIES G.U.E.'s request for judicial notice, which attached a printout from PAC's website. Consideration of material 
outside the four corners of the Complaint is inappropriate at this procedural stage. Americopters, LLC v. F.A.A., 441 F.3d 726, 
732 n.4 (9th Cir. 2006). "
837,4," PAC also briefly argues that G.U.E. fails to state a claim of trade libel because the statements it alleges are ones of opinion, 
and not assertions of fact. (Dkt. 16 [""Def.'s Mot.""] at 17.) This argument is meritless. Several of the statements G.U.E. alleges 
PAC to have made are clearly assertions of fact—most notably the assertion that it would take 30 weeks to integrate G.U.E. 
games with PAC systems. (See Compl. ¶ 275.) "
848,1, Hershey Canada is the only one of the Canadian Chocolate Manufacturers that is a party to this appeal.
848,2," Because we conclude that the District Court correctly granted summary judgment for the Chocolate Manufacturers, we do not 
reach the secondary question of whether the District Court abused its discretion by excluding a portion of the Individual Plaintiffs' 
economic expert's report calculating the damages caused by Nestlé USA. "
849,3," Trade spend refers to rebates, allowances, discounts, and promotions that manufacturers individually negotiate with retailers 
that effectively lower the price that the customer pays. "
850,4," Several defendants also moved to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(2). After initially deferring ruling on 
these motions, the District Court ultimately granted the motions as to Mars Canada, Nestlé S.A., and Nestlé Canada. See In re 
Chocolate Confectionary Antitrust Litig., 641 F. Supp. 2d 367, 373 (M.D. Pa. 2009)."

851,6," As explained earlier, we do not reach this issue because we will affirm the District Court's summary judgment. See supra note 
2."
851,7," HN3[
] A horizontal price-fixing agreement occurs when competitors on the same market level agree to fix or control prices for 
their goods or services. "
852,8," We illustrated the point well in Flat Glass by comparing the theories involved in Matsushita and Petruzzi's, see 385 F.3d at 358, 
and we summarize that discussion here. In Matsushita, the Supreme Court criticized the alleged multi-firm, predatory pricing 
scheme as inherently ""speculative,"" so the Court refused to draw an inference of a conspiracy from ambiguous evidence. See 
475 U.S. at 588-91, 597-98. In Petruzzi's, by contrast, we drew more liberal inferences in the plaintiff's favor because the 
plaintiff's theory—that the defendants conspired not to compete with each other on existing customer accounts—made ""perfect 
economic sense."" 998 F.2d at 1232. The only way for the defendants in Petruzzi's to increase profits in this manner was by 
agreement. Moreover, this conduct of refusing to compete was obviously not procompetitive. Id."
852,9," HN9[
] The ""strictures of Matsushita d[o] not apply"" when plaintiffs use direct evidence to prove a conspiracy because ""no 
inferences are required from direct evidence to establish a fact,"" thus negating any concern about the reasonableness of the 
inferences drawn from that evidence. Petruzzi's, 998 F.2d at 1233. Nor are these concerns implicated when there is ""strong 
circumstantial evidence"" because such evidence is ""sufficiently unambiguous."" Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). "
853,10," An oligopoly is a market ""in which a few relatively large sellers account for the bulk of the output."" 2B Phillip E. Areeda & 
Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law ¶ 404a, at 10 (4th ed. 2014). "
855,11," Line pricing is the practice engaged in by retailers of setting the same retail price for competing candy products of the same 
size. Given the practice of line pricing, the Chocolate Manufacturers contend that once one manufacturer raises list prices, it 
makes sense for all to follow. If a retailer raises the retail price on all competing candy products of a given size in response to 
one manufacturer raising list prices, the other manufacturers will suffer a decline in sales volume due to the higher retail price 
and lose out on any increased revenue unless they follow the list price increase. See J.A. 1084; see also J.A. 1278 (Mars 2002 
document explaining it would follow Hershey's price increase on kings because ""the market would move to the higher price with 
or [**28]  without us"")."
855,12," This case is quite different from Petruzzi's, where we said the economic evidence went ""a long way"" in meeting the plaintiff's 
burden. 998 F.2d at 1241. There the alleged conspiracy was not price fixing but instead an agreement to compete only on new 
customer accounts and not to compete on existing customer accounts (i.e., competition ended once a defendant ""won"" a new 
account). The industry (fat and bone rendering) was homogeneous, meaning the only basis for competition among the 
defendants was price. The economic evidence in Petruzzi's showed a price differential between new and existing accounts (new 
accounts were offered a significantly better price than were existing accounts), which could only rationally be explained by an 
unlawful agreement. Id. Here, by contrast, the Plaintiffs' economic evidence is based on parallel price increases among "
856,," oligopolists without corresponding cost increases, a result which, as previously noted, is as consistent with interdependence as 
with a conspiracy. "
857,13," Our decision in Flat Glass is not to the contrary. There we noted in dicta that evidence of a defendant's price fixing in a market 
for original equipment manufacturer glass would [**38]  be relevant to the claim that the same defendant also conspired to fix 
prices in the market for flat glass, a closely related but distinct product market in the same geographic area. See 385 F.3d at "
858,377," -78. The evidence in Flat Glass involved identical companies and one executive who participated in the price-fixing 
conspiracies in both product markets. It is therefore consistent with the rule stated above because the people and companies 
involved in both conspiracies overlapped. Nor does the standard we adopt here conflict with Continental Ore Co. v. Union Carbide & Carbon Corp., 370 U.S. 690, 82 S. Ct. 
1404, 8 L. Ed. 2d 777 (1962). Continental Ore is inapposite because the relevant foreign conduct in that case was part of a 
single conspiracy that ""was effectuated both here and abroad,"" id. at 706, and the Plaintiffs do not contend a single conspiracy 
existed here."
858,14," We have doubts about the actuation theory [**42]  and whether it unduly blurs an already fine line between lawful 
interdependence and unlawful conspiracies, especially when the alleged conspiracy involves price fixing among oligopolists 
supposedly formed by a tacit agreement. ""[E]ven when each firm rests its own [pricing] decision upon its belief that competitors 
will do the same,"" that only shows interdependence, not a conspiracy. Clamp-All, 851 F.2d at 484. But because the District Court 
concluded that Dr. Vellturo's theory was admissible and the Chocolate Manufacturers do not challenge that decision on appeal, 
we reject the theory's application on its own terms. "
859,15," Dr. Vellturo's explanation of the actuation theory in his report drives home the point. There he opines that before 2002, the 
Chocolate Manufacturers were unable to raise prices together. Posing a thought experiment, he says to ""consider a scenario in 
which U.S. executives from each Defendant with pricing authority for both the U.S. and Canada fly to a meeting in Canada"" and 
""[w]ithout ever uttering an express word regarding U.S. prices, the three executives agree to raise prices in Canada by 10%."" 
J.A. 2193. The thought experiment continues with the executives returning to the U.S. and monitoring the Canadian [**43]  
outcomes, and then, without any further communication, one firm announces a price increase of 10% in the U.S. Dr. Vellturo 
opines that under these circumstances, the ""coordinated anti-competitive agreement in Canada has significantly changed the 
information known about likely responses to a price increase in the U.S. by these same companies,"" with the price leader 
expecting the other companies to follow the price increase. J.A. 2194. This thought experiment presumes not only that the 
conspirators in the U.S. knew of the Canadian conspiracy but also that the U.S. conspirators are the same people as the 
Canadian conspirators. Moreover, at oral argument, counsel for the Individual Plaintiffs clearly explained that Dr. Vellturo premised his theory on 
evidence showing ""that the U.S. executives with pricing authority at a minimum knew that there was a [sic] joint conduct in 
Canada, 
[and] 
at 
a 
maximum 
directed 
that 
it 
occur.""

ca3.uscourts.gov/oralargument/audio/14-2790InReChocolateConfectionaryAntitrust.mp3. That being said, Dr. Vellturo backtracked in his deposition by asserting that the U.S. Chocolate Manufacturers' awareness of the 
Canadian conspiracy was ""not [**44]  essential to [his] opinion."" J.A. 2529. In that case, we acknowledge that the factual 
prerequisites for this variation of the actuation theory—that the Chocolate Manufacturers monitored Canadian prices and 
communicated (lawfully) with their Canadian affiliates—are satisfied. But under this variant theory, the inference of a U.S. 
conspiracy is tenuous because the U.S. result of parallel pricing is perfectly consistent with interdependence. See Areeda & 
Hovenkamp, supra, ¶ 1422b, at 170 (noting that facilitating devices alone do not imply a traditional conspiracy because ""any 
parallelism in subsequent behavior will often be of the sort that can be satisfactorily explained by oligopolistic interdependence 
alone and without regard to the facilitating practice"")."
859,16," To the extent Dr. Vellturo's opinion is based only on similar outcomes, see supra note 15, it is insufficient on its own to create 
a reasonable inference of a conspiracy. "
860,17," ""My father taught me . . . keep your friends close, but your enemies closer."" The Godfather Part [**47]  II (Paramount Pictures 
1974)."
860,18," A September 2005 email from Don Robinson, President of Mars Canada, to Robert Gamgort, President of Mars North 
America, does not show that Mars executives in the U.S. knew of the Canadian conspiracy. In that email, Robinson said that ""an 
industry wide price increase has been rumoured for a few weeks"" and reported the price increases already taken and being 
taken by Mars Canada's competitors. J.A. 1395. Unlike the aforementioned 2003 Brown to Snyder email, for example (which 
suggested that Hershey Canada contemplated a coordinated response to a Nestlé Canada price increase with its rivals), this 
Mars email does not include information that tends to show a Canadian conspiracy. Nor does a March 2002 email from Frank Higgins, Vice President of Marketing for Nestlé [**50]  USA, to other Nestlé USA 
executives show that Nestlé USA knew of the ongoing Canadian conspiracy. In that email, Higgins reported on a Hershey 
Canada price increase and promised he would ""get[] more information from Nestl[é] Canada to assess the likelihood that they 
will increase prices in the US."" J.A. 7394. This email shows that Nestlé USA monitored outcomes in Canada but says nothing of 
whether Nestlé USA knew the price increases there were the result of interdependence or a conspiracy. "
862,19," Compare J.A. 7105 (2002 Hershey internal document explaining that ""the bidders conducted extensive due diligence reviews 
and were provided with additional information as requested (in some instances for competitive and regulatory reasons only 
certain non-operational personnel of potential bidders were provided information)""), and J.A. 13295-96 (Direct Purchaser Class's 
expert acknowledging the complete lack of record evidence showing that either Nestlé S.A. or Nestlé USA received information 
about Hershey's commodities cost coverage), with J.A. 12843-45 (Cadbury officer acknowledging that Cadbury received 
information about Hershey's commodities cost coverage in an email from an investment banker working for Hershey during the 
sale process). "
867,1," Of course, this Court expresses no view regarding whose version of events is true."
867,2," The counterclaim asserts that even before January 2013, Ms. Kinsman identified Mr. Winston as her rapist. In that regard, the 
counterclaim alleges: ""On December 7, 2012 and on multiple occasions thereafter, Ms. Kinsman told her friends and family that 
Mr. Winston raped her."" (Def.'s Answer ¶43.) "
868,3," The counterclaim includes these ""leaks"" among the listed ""False Statements,"" but it does not specify what defamatory 
information they contained; presumably, they repeated the claim that Mr. Winston raped Ms. Kinsman."
868,4," To the extent Ms. Kinsman contends the conditional privilege also applies to her statements to the media and other non-
governmental parties, the Court summarily rejects that argument. See Fridovich v. Fridovich, 598 So.2d 65, 69 n.8 (Fla. 1992) 
(emphasizing that qualified privilege covering statements to police or prosecutor does not apply to defamatory statements made 
to private individuals)."
868,5," The Noerr-Pennington doctrine is derived from E. R.R. Presidents Conf. v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 81 S. Ct. 
523, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464 (1961), and United Mine Workers of Am. v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 85 S. Ct. 1585, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626 
(1965). "
869,6," Wagner, Nugent, Johnson, Roth, Romano, Erikson & Kupfer, P.A. v. Flanagan, 629 So.2d 113 (Fla. 1993), is 
distinguishable. That case involved a single defamatory publication and the issue presented was whether the discovery rule 
should apply in determining when a defamation claim accrues for limitations purposes. "
870,7," It is unnecessary to reach the issue of whether the tortious interference counterclaim is compulsory based on the Court's 
conclusion, discussed next, that the tortious interference claim is barred by the single action rule."
870,8," Londono v. Turkey Creek, Inc., 609 So.2d 14 (Fla. 1992), is distinguishable. In Londono, the issue was whether a slander of 
title claim was barred because it should have been raised as a compulsory counterclaim in a prior lawsuit. Notably, some of the 
activity that constituted alleged slander of title occurred after the first lawsuit was filed. 609 So.2d at 15-16 (noting that first 
lawsuit was filed in March 1982 and second suit was based on conduct that allegedly occurred from early 1982 through May 
1984). Deciding that the two lawsuits were ""separate controversies with distinct and unrelated facts,"" the Supreme Court of 
Florida ruled that the subsequent ""slander of title action was not a compulsory counterclaim"" that must have been raised in the 
first action. Id. at 20. Republic Health Corp. v. Lifemark Hosps. of Fla., Inc., 755 F.2d 1453 (11th Cir. 1985), is also inapposite. As in Londono, the 
issue in Republic Health was whether claims asserted in a second lawsuit should have been brought as compulsory 
counterclaims in a prior suit. The Eleventh Circuit determined that the complaint in the first lawsuit ""focused on a narrow issue,"" 
while the complaint in the second suit was much broader, ""contain[ing] a wide range of allegations"" that went ""far beyond the 
discrete issue"" the first tribunal was asked to decide. 755 F.2d at 1455. Accordingly, the appellate court held that there was not a 
""sufficient logical relationship"" between the two suits to warrant the conclusion that the claims in the second suit were 
compulsory counterclaims. Id. "
873,9," A contrary rule would eviscerate state law defamation liability as a remedy for victims of false crime reports to the police and 
prosecutors."
873,10," Much more thorough briefing, presumably at the summary judgment stage, will be necessary to convince the Court that Noerr-
Pennington has even theoretical application to this kind of case. In the context of the present dispute, the doctrine seems entirely 
superfluous. As previously noted, Noerr-Pennington does not immunize false statements. So, if Ms. Kinsman's rape reports were 
false, as Mr. Winston contends, Noerr-Pennington does not apply. On the other hand, if the fact-finder determines that Ms. 
Kinsman's rape allegations are true, she cannot be found to have committed defamation and will have no need for Noerr-
Pennington immunity."
873,11," Ms. Kinsman argues that the statements she made to non-government audiences, which she characterizes as ""associated 
communications,"" are also immunized by Noerr-Pennington. (Pl.'s Mot. 17.) If these statements to the media and other third 
parties can somehow also be considered a form of First Amendment petitioning activity, Mr. Winston's allegations that these 
statements were false precludes dismissal on the basis of Noerr-Pennington. "
881,1," We have omitted any internal quotation marks, alterations, emphasis, or citations here and throughout this opinion, unless 
otherwise noted. "
892,2," SawStop also argued that the complaint alleged sufficient direct evidence of a conspiracy to avoid dismissal. See Robertson, 
679 F.3d at 289 (holding that a complaint can state a § 1 claim if it alleges ""direct evidence"" of the agreement itself); but see Am. 
Chiropractic Ass'n v. Trigon Healthcare, Inc., 367 F.3d 212, 226 (4th Cir. 2004) (indicating that ""smoking gun"" direct evidence is 
""extremely rare in antitrust cases""). As SawStop's complaint meets ""Twombly's requirements with respect to allegations of illegal 
parallel conduct,"" Robertson, 679 F.3d at 290, we need not determine whether SawStop has adequately alleged direct evidence. "
894,3," Many of the same allegations that carry SawStop's complaint past a motion to dismiss -- the ""who, what, when, and where"" -- 
may substantially focus [*46]  the discovery in a way that was not possible in Twombly. See id. at 560 n.6 (noting the difficulty 
and expense of discovery directed toward ""some illegal agreement"" ""between unspecific persons"" ""at some point over seven 
years.""). "
907,1," In making this point, the majority credits scraps of testimony from David Peot cherry-picked by SD3 while it ignores the district 
court's diligent review of the full trial transcript. Ante at 37. When read in full, Peot's testimony focused on defendants' joint 
venture, formed years after the alleged group boycott. J.A. 134-40. Far from revealing a collective refusal to deal, Peot clarified 
that defendants planned ""to use whatever technology we felt would be best to prevent table saw accidents. There were no 
limitations that I can remember one way or the other."" J.A. 140. This discrepancy is emblematic of plaintiffs' attempt to conjure a 
conspiracy and of the majority's willingness to overlook the holes in the [*97]  narrative. "
908,2," I thus concur in Part VI of the majority opinion dismissing SD3's challenge to the actions of the standard-setting organization, 
Underwriters Laboratories, Inc. (UL). I also concur [*101]  in Part III rejecting SD3's claims against a number of defendants 
simply lumped into a conspiracy through nothing more than conclusory allegations. "
911,1," Dr. Kneuper's report has been filed under seal. The exhibits filed as part of Zarembas' motion as docket number 358 are not 
otherwise available on the CM-ECF electronic docket. Dr. Kneuper's full report is available to the Court as a sealed document as 
Exhibit 68 to Encana's second motion for summary judgment. (ECF No. 362-56 ""Kneuper Report."") "

that it was SAG, not ATA, that rejected the tentative agreement to reinstate Rule 16(g). (ICM Mot. at 15; FAC ¶ 51.) "
921,3," Given that Plaintiff's Sherman Act claim fails because it does not allege that Defendants intended to create a monopoly in a

945,194, See Docket No. 650.
945,195," See Docket No. 553 at 2:5. Wilson's declaration does not qualify as an expert report because it does not purport to contain ""a 
complete statement of all opinions the witness will express,"" as Rule 26(a)(2)(B)(i) requires. See Docket Nos. 636-25, 636-26, 
636-27. Second, few of Wilson's opinions supply ""the facts or data considered by the witness in forming them,"" as Rule 
26(a)(2)(B)(ii) requires. Id. Under Rule 26(a)(2)(B)(ii), each opinion must be substantiated with the precise ""reasoning and 
thought process that led to the ultimate decision,"" and an expert's general qualifications are insufficient. See Henson v. Baker

Third, the declaration is missing ""a list of all publications authored in the previous 10 years,"" as Rule 26(a)(2)(B)(iv) requires.

954,1," Moreover, allegations of fraudulent conduct made under section 17200 must be pleaded with particularity and comply with 
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b). Vess v. Ciba-Geigy Corp. USA, 317 F.3d 1097, 1106 (9th Cir. 2003). "
956,1," These were First Data's first claim and SecurityMetrics's fourth counterclaim. The claims sought to determine whether the 
Terms of Settlement granted SecurityMetrics the right to use data from merchants whom it had previously enrolled in its services 
or whether that right [*5]  extended to all merchants whose information had been provided to SecurityMetrics by First Data (i.e., 
enrolled and unenrolled merchants). "
957,2," In the payment card industry, there are a few main types of service providers. An ""issuer"" issues a payment card to a consumer 
and bills and collects amounts due from the consumer. The other main service is provided on the merchant side; when a 
consumer attempts to pay a merchant for goods or services with a payment card, an ""acquirer"" obtains authorization for the 
transaction from the consumer's issuer and then clears and settles the transaction so that the merchant gets paid and the 
consumer's account gets charged. Acquirers perform the underwriting requirements and take on the financial risks of fraud. In 
addition, some payment card brands or associations operate in open networks that allow separate entities or banks to operate 
as issuers and acquirers; in such open networks, ""processors"" help to facilitate the communication and settlement of 
payment. [*7]  FDMS is an acquirer, while FDC is the payment processor for FDMS's transactions."
957,3," The PCI Data Security Standard (""PCI Standard"" or ""PCI DSS""), which was developed by the PCI Security Standards Council, 
has been adopted by the major credit card brands as their data security compliance requirement for all merchants. Thus, the 
card brands enforce compliance with the PCI Standard and determine the penalties for non-compliance. While the PCI 
Standard's requirements vary based upon the size of a merchant, the category of merchants at issue in this case are ""Level 4 
merchants."" Under PCI Standard, Level 4 merchants, who have a lower volume of transactions, must complete the Self-
Assessment Questionnaire (""SAQ""). The SAQ is a validation tool intended to assist merchants in self-evaluating their 
compliance with the PCI Standard. For those Level 4 merchants who conduct sales over the internet, however, the PCI Data 
Security Standard requires vulnerability scans of its computer system. These scans must be performed by Approved Scanning 
Vendors (""ASV""), which are approved by the PCI Council."
957,4," For purposes of this Memorandum Opinion, the relevant documents include the original January 2008 contract (the ""Master 
Services Agreement"") (ECF No. 275-2) and a separate ""Statement of Work"" (ECF No. 275-3), and the 2011 Amendment to the 
Master Services Agreement (ECF No. 275-5)."
957,5," According to First Data, the event that precipitated the falling-out was First Data's instruction to SecurityMetrics to stop using 
the data provided by First [*9]  Data for out-bound solicitations to Level 4 merchants. First Data believes that this action was 
consistent with the contract. First Data alleges that, thereafter, SecurityMetrics accused First Data of breaching the contract, cut 
off First Data's access to SecurityMetrics' interactive database, and stopped submitting PCI compliance reports with the START 
feeds. "
958,6," By representation of counsel, this service is no longer offered."
958,7," SecurityMetrics initiated a case in the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah—SecurityMetrics, Inc. v. First Data Merchant 
Services Corp., No. 2:13-cv-149 (D. Utah)—in early 2013. "
959,8," The parties also submitted numerous motions in limine, which this Court considered [*14]  and ruled upon in the weeks leading 
up to trial."
959,9," This Court excluded the expert testimony and report of Dr. Michael Belch, who had opined that ""if PCI Rapid Comply is not 
approved or certified by the PCI Council, the consumer (merchant) is being deceived and harmed by the creation of a false 
sense of security, and the fact that they are paying for a service they are not receiving."" Belch Report ¶ 23, MIL #1 Ex. A, ECF 
No. 253-2. In reaching its conclusion, this Court noted that Dr. Belch had failed to employ a control, had removed the original 
context of the marketing material, and had failed to account for other causes of consumer confusion."
959,10," These claims largely addressed the method and format of SecurityMetrics' compliance reporting to First Data. SecurityMetrics' 
third counterclaim, however, sought a declaration that the confidentiality term of the Terms of Settlement was unenforceable. 
This claim became moot due to the presumption of openness of court records upon this Court's ruling on the motions for 
summary judgment. "
960,11," SecurityMetrics also filed a Motion for Leave to File Audio Recording as Exhibit (ECF No. 393), which will be GRANTED."
960,12," Rule 59(e) applies only to final judgments. See Fayetteville Investors v. Commercial Builders, Inc., 936 F.2d 1462, 1469 (4th 
Cir. 1991). "
961,13," The other elements are : (1) the misrepresentation is material, in that it is likely to influence the purchasing decision; (2) the misrepresentation 
actually deceives or has the tendency to deceive a substantial segment of its audience; (3) the defendant placed the false 
or misleading statement in interstate commerce; and (4) the plaintiff has been or is likely to be injured as a result of the 
misrepresentation, either by direct diversion of sales or by a lessening of goodwill associated with its products. PBM Products, LLC v. Mead Johnson & Co., 639 F.3d 111, 120 (4th Cir. 2011) (quoting Scotts Co. v. United Industries, 315 
F.3d 264, 272 (4th Cir. 2002))."
961,14," The statements at issue are as follows: If you choose to use a third-party vendor [*21]  for PCI DSS compliance services, you will need to contract with and pay 
that vendor directly. In addition to your alternate vendor's charges for PCI DSS compliance services, you still will need to 
pay the Compliance Service Fee charged to you by your merchant services provider. The Compliance Service Fee is not 
affected by your choice to use a third-party vendor. If First Data's PCI compliance services are contractually available to you, you will be charged an applicable annual 
compliance fee for those services, regardless of whether you use them or utilize the services of some other third-party PCI 
compliance services vendor. If you utilize the additional services of a third party vendor, you will pay that third party 
vendor's charges for those fees in addition to First Data's annual compliance fee. Countercls. ¶ 112."
961,15," SecurityMetrics suggests that First Data simply ignored the first statement identified by First Data (and particularly the 
statement that ""[t]he Compliance Service Fee is not affected by your choice to use a third-party vendor.""). In its papers, 
SecurityMetrics argued that First Data's motion should be denied to this first statement because ""First Data has not even 
addressed [*22]  this other advertisement in its opening brief—and First Data should not be permitted to do so, for the first time, 
on reply."" Reply 6, ECF No. 298. SecurityMetrics reiterated this position at the December 12, 2014 hearing. "
962,," Considering that SecurityMetrics presented arguments regarding the first statement, it is clear that SecurityMetrics was aware 
that First Data's Motion was directed at both statements. Indeed, as First Data points out, First Data's motion cites to both 
statements, and the statements contain similar content. Considering that First Data had an opportunity to present argument on 
both statements in both its Response in Opposition and at the December 12, 2014 hearing, this Court will not deny First Data's 
Motion on these grounds."
962,16," For example, counsel explained to the Court that ""our suggestion to the Court today is [*25]  that, and I'll go through really 
what I believe the law is and what the law should be applied by the Court might be, is that a literally false statement, A, is a 
factual determination to be made by a fact-finder."" Dec. 12, 2014 Tr. at 49:6-11, ECF No. 329. "
963,17," Specifically, First Data's Memorandum Supporting its Motion for Summary Judgment as to Certain of SecurityMetrics' 
Counterclaims (ECF No. 273) stated that ""SM's Eighth Counterclaim alleges that First Data violated Utah's Truth in Advertising 
Act (the ""Utah Advertising Act"") by engaging in the same conduct alleged in the 'injurious falsehood' and Lanham Act claims."" 
FD's Mem. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. Countercls. at 22. Additionally, First Data argued that ""the provisions [*28]  in the Utah 
Advertising Act cited by SM track the Lanham Act on consumer confusion, so this claim fails for the same reasons discussed 
above. See Utah Code § 13-11a-3(1)(b), (c), (e)."" Id."
963,18," As such, SecurityMetrics effectively waived those allegations. See Majica v. Montgomery Cnty., MD, Civ. A. no. 8:12-cv-823-
AW, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18243, 2013 WL 326734, at *6 (D. Md. Jan. 28, 2013) (finding plaintiff abandoned claim when 
challenged by motion to dismiss and Plaintiff failed to address claim in response). "
964,19," Specifically, SecurityMetrics cites to, inter alia, Herman Schwabe, Inc. v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., 297 F.2d 906 (2d Cir. 
1962), J.F. Feeser, Inc. v. Serv-A-Portion, Inc., 909 F.2d 1524 (3d Cir. 1990), and Gallimore v. Newman Machine Co., 301 F. 
Supp. 2d 431 (M.D.N.C. 2004). "
965,20," The Court notes that SecurityMetrics asserts that it should have been permitted to proceed on its reduced output theory, 
despite a lack of evidence regarding the status of its other ""lost"" merchants, because third-party discovery would have been 
onerous and First Data could have provided the information. While SecurityMetrics identifies a few cases in which courts have 
found burden shifting appropriate, those cases arose in totally different circumstances not involving antitrust issues. See Morris 
v. Williams, 67 Cal. 2d 733, 63 Cal. Rptr. 689, 433 P.2d 697 (Cal. 1967) (challenge to regulations for state health care program); 
United States v. Denver & Rio Grande R. Co., 191 U.S. 84, 24 S. Ct. 33, 48 L. Ed. 106 (1903) (action of trover); Pace v. Hymas, 
111 Idaho 581, 726 P.2d 693 (1986) (employment & civil rights). In this case, SecurityMetrics seeks to proceed on a claim where 
it has speculated about the status of several of its lost merchants and then seeks to utilize that speculation to prove a reduction 
in the number of data security compliance customers that was caused by First Data's actions, all without any expert analysis or 
testimony. Such ""speculation"" and ""compilation of inferences"" is not sufficient to survive a motion for summary judgment. See 
Shin v. Shalala, 166 F. Supp. 2d at 375."
965,21," SecurityMetrics suggests that FTC v. Indiana Federation of Dentists, 476 U.S. 447, 106 S. Ct. 2009, 90 L. Ed. 2d 445 (1986), 
a case involving reduced [*34]  output, did not require any expert analysis on the issue of reduced output. Specifically, the Court 
noted that, ""[i]n this case, we conclude that the finding of actual, sustained adverse effects on competition in those areas where 
[defendant] dentists predominated, viewed in light of the reality that markets for dental services tend to be relatively localized, is 
legally sufficient to support a finding that the challenged restraint was unreasonable even in the absence of elaborate market 
analysis."" F.T.C. v. Indiana Fed'n of Dentists, 476 U.S. 447, 461, 106 S. Ct. 2009, 90 L. Ed. 2d 445 (1986). As this passage 
indicates, the F.T.C. arose under very different circumstances—involving a local market and sustained impact on a market. 
Moreover, the issue presented to the Court was whether proof of actual effects on competition was sufficient to render an inquiry 
into market definition and market power unnecessary; the Court never opined as to the usefulness or necessity of expert 
testimony as it pertained to proving reduced output."
965,22," Although this Court's ruling on summary judgment did not expressly rely on this point, this Court noted that SecurityMetrics' 
damages expert (Dr. Nelson) had failed to disaggregate his damages calculations. See Dec. 30, 2014 Mem. Op. at 40 n.31. As 
this Court [*35]  pointed out, failure on one of its counterclaims—or simply one of the theories posited in any of those various 
counterclaims—would give rise to serious issues regarding Dr. Nelson's calculations. See Mem. Op. Mots. In Limine at 24 n.27, 
ECF No. 313 (noting that failure to disaggregate calculation of damages based upon claims becomes problematic after one or 
more theories of liability are eliminated from a case); see also Pharmanetics, Inc. v. Aventis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 182 F. 
App'x 267 (4th Cir. May 31, 2006) (unpublished); Comcast Corp. v. Behrend,     U.S.    , 133 S. Ct. 1426, 185 L. Ed. 2d 515 
(2013). This matter has yet to be addressed in SecurityMetrics' filings. "
966,23," In its Reply brief, First Data also seeks an additional $134,865.04 in attorneys' fees that were incurred in preparing its fee 
petition and supporting papers. "
967,24," Both parties initially sought damages in connection to some of their claims, see Pls.' Am. Compl. 49, ECF No. 92; Def.'s 
Countercl. 69, ECF No. 157, but no damages were ultimately awarded to either party. In the context of this case, however, the 
Court does not view the specific dollar amounts sought to be a particularly helpful metric by which to assess the parties' success. 
The various claims for injunctive and declarative relief predominated and were the most heavily and contentiously litigated; 
indeed, the record reflects countless disputes arising from this Court's interim orders governing the conduct of the parties and 
their interactions with third [*41]  parties during the pendency of this litigation."
967,25," While First Data employed retired Judge Benson Legg, previously a member of this Court, to opine on the reasonableness of 
First Data's fees, Judge Legg did not consider whether First Data was a prevailing party under Utah law. "
968,26," The Court notes that First Data's challenge to the Lanham Act counterclaims in its Motion to Dismiss Counterclaims was not 
framed in the context of a literally false vs. misleading dichotomy; instead, First Data challenged the counterclaim because it 
asserted that the counterclaim was premised upon a failure to disclose, which it asserted was not actionable in the Fourth 
Circuit. See FD's Mem. Supp. Mot. Dismiss Certain Countercls. at 8, ECF No. 163-1. As [*44]  this was the issue raised by the 
parties, the Court's ruling was limited to that precise issue."
968,27," Because this Court finds that First Data is not entitled to attorneys' fees under either the [*45]  Utah Truth in Advertising Act or 
the Lanham Act, this Court does not address the reasonableness of First Data's claimed fees. This Court notes, however, that 
First Data's fee allocations appear somewhat concerning. First Data's use of a 4/15 reduction is problematic as First Data also 
had nine affirmative claims for relief. Several of the entries on just the first few pages of First Data's schedule of charges do not 
indicate whether the work was performed in an offensive posturing with respect to First Data's affirmative claims or in a 
defensive posture with respect to SecurityMetrics' counterclaims."
968,28," SecurityMetrics originally sought $52,876.25 in attorneys' fees, but it reduced the amount via its Notice of Errata re Motion for 
Attorneys Fees (ECF No. 399). "
973,1," Pursuant to Magistrate Judge Ellis's May 20, 2014 Order, the following cases were consolidated for pretrial purposes under 
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 42(a): 1:13-CV-09244; 1:13-CV-09250, 1:14-CV-00 116, 1:14-CV-00644, 1:14-CV-01493, 1:14-
CV-02532, 1:14-CV-01661, 1:14-CV-02617, 1:14-CV-01691, 1:14-CV-01788, 1:14-CV-02424, 1:14-CV-02378, 1:14-CV-02137, 
1:14-CV-02846. See Dkt. 46."
973,2," It is undisputed that because Plaintiffs are indirect purchasers, they may not recover overcharges under federal antitrust law 
or under the laws of those states which follow the rule of Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 97 S. Ct. 2061, 52 L. Ed. 2d 
707 (1977). Accordingly, Plaintiffs have [*10]  standing to assert violations of only the state antitrust laws that do not follow 
Illinois Brick, and any claims under the laws of states following Illinois Brick fail as a matter of law."
973,3," The facts are taken from the CAC and are presumed to be true for the purposes of this motion to dismiss. The Court also 
considers the settlement agreements referenced in the CAC and filed under seal, in accordance with its prior ruling. Dkt. 118. 
See also See In re Thelen LLP, 736 F.3d 213, 219 (2d Cir. 2013) (""In adjudicating a motion to dismiss, a court may consider ... 
any document upon which the complaint heavily relies."") (quotations and citation omitted). "
974,4," The current version of this provision provides: ""For patents that claim the drug substance, the applicant shall submit information 
only on those patents that claim the drug substance [*12]  that is the subject of the pending or approved application or that claim 
a drug substance that is the same as the active ingredient that is the subject of the approved or pending application ... For 
patents that claim a drug product, the applicant shall submit information only on those patents that claim a drug product .. that is 
described in the pending or approved application."" 21 C.F.R. § 314.53(b) (2014). "
977,5," Actavis and Ranbaxy's AND As indicated [*23]  that they were not seeking to market generic ACTOS until after the 777 patent 
expired. See Def. Joint Mem. at 7."
977,6," As discussed further below, by separate agreement, Mylan, as the first-filer for ACTOplus, was also granted a license to enter 
that market no later than December 14, 2012. Def. Ex. 3, Mylan ACTOplus Agreement. "
978,7," Earlier entry was permitted, for instance, if the date of first commercial marketing of a generic ACTOS product by a third party 
under an FDA approved ANDA, Ex. 1, Ranbaxy Agreement at 7, or a final decision holding that the adjudicated claims of the 
licensed patents for ACTOS were invalid, Ex. 2, Mylan ACTOS Agreement at 9 occurred prior to the dates fixed by the 
agreements. "
980,8," Excluded from both classes are Defendants and their officers, directors, employees, corporate parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, 
representatives, and agents; federal or state governmental entities except for cities, towns or municipalities with self-funded 
prescription drug plans; all persons or entities that purchased [*33]  ACTOS and/or ACTOplus or the AB-rated generic 
equivalent for purposes of resale and/or directly from Defendants or their affiliates; fully insured health care plans; any ""flat co-
pay"" consumers whose purchases were paid, in part, by a third party payor, and those whose co-payment was the same 
regardless of the retail purchase price; Pharmacy Benefit Managers without capitation agreements; and the Court, Court 
personnel, and their family members. CAC ¶ 167. "
981,9," The parties do not address the extent to which the state statutes differ from the federal antitrust laws and the standards 
announced in Actavis. Although these potential differences are not raised in Defendants' motion, they may provide an additional 
basis for dismissal. See In re Cipro Cases I & II, 61 Cal. 4th 116, 141, 187 Cal. Rptr. 3d 632, 348 P.3d 845 (2015) (noting that 
Actavis is not dispositive of reverse payment claim under California statute). See also In re Aggrenox Antitrust Litig., 94 F. Supp. 
3d. 224  , 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 35634, 2015 WL 1311352, at *24 (D. Conn. Mar. 23, 2015) (dismissing indirect purchaser 
claims where plaintiffs ""attempt[ed] to build a Frankensteinian equivalent of Actavis"" to reach conduct for which plaintiffs could 
not attack under federal law because of Illinois Brick's prohibition on indirect purchaser suits). "
982,10," This settlement is addressed separately below, infra p. 29."
982,11," Both Ranbaxy and Teva's agreements, however, did contain optional [*41]  supply provisions that allowed them to purchase 
drug product from Takeda. Def. Ex. 1, Ranbaxy Agreement at 10; Ex. 5, Teva Agreement at 17. "
984,12," As described above, Teva was permitted to enter the ACTOS market as Takeda's authorized generic on the same date. "
985,13," In fact, acceleration clauses were pleaded as an alleged ""payment"" in In re Loestrin, but the Court summarily rejected 
plaintiffs' theory. See 45 F. Supp. 3d at 191 (holding that Actavis did not apply to non-cash settlement terms). "
986,14," At least one other court has rejected a reverse payment claim based on a similar settlement term—licenses for entry in foreign 
markets for another drug manufactured by the brand. See In re Lipitor, 46 F. Supp. 3d at 546. "
987,15," The agreements in Teikoku Pharma and In re Niaspan included additional payment-like terms. In Teikoku Pharma, the 
settlement included a supply agreement under which the patentee supplied the infringer generic with product worth $12 million 
dollars once a month for eight months. 74 F. Supp. 3d at 1070. The settlement terms in In re Niaspan included a co-promotion 
agreement under which the brand paid the generic a royalty on all sales of the drug at issue and another drug produced by the 
brand in return for product promotion, [*59]  as well as a manufacturing agreement that included a lump sum and quarterly 
payments from the brand to the generic in exchange for the generic agreeing to act as a back-up supplier for the brand. 42 F. 
Supp. 3d at 744. "
988,16," The settlements in King Drug included actual cash payments as well as supply and manufacturing provisions. 2015 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 9545, 2015 WL 356913, at *3-5."
988,17," Another court in this Circuit has suggested that generalized allegations may suffice on this issue. See In re Aggrenox, 2015 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 35634, 2015 WL 1311352, at *13 (rejecting defendants' argument that allegations of the settlement's value 
were not sufficiently specific, noting that ""precise and particularized estimates of fair value and anticipated litigation costs"" may 
require discovery). In contrast to the facts here, however, the allegations in In re Aggrenox specified the amounts of upfront cash 
payments and royalties paid under the agreements. 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 35634, [WL] at *12. "
990,18," Takeda further argues that Plaintiffs' argument fails because the regulatory scheme requires only that the brand manufacturer 
list ""patents"" in the Orange Book, and [*69]  does not provide for a ""claim-by-claim"" listing system for patents with multiple 
claims. Takeda Mem. at 15 (""The number of claims contained within a particular patent does not affect the ability of the patent to 
be listed as long as there is at least one claim that meets the two required elements."" (citing 68 Fed. Reg. 36,676, 36,685 (June 
18, 2003)). The Court need not engage in a textual analysis of the regulations, however, because as discussed below, even 
assuming the listing of the 584 and 404 patents in the Orange Book was, at least in part, inaccurate, Plaintiffs have not plausibly 
alleged an antitrust injury resulting from that conduct. "
991,19," Plaintiffs' theory that the Orange Book listings served as a ""lynchpin"" for the settlement agreements, Pl. Opp. at 54, is 
discussed separately below."
991,20," To be considered ""sharn litigation,"" a lawsuit must be (1) ""objectively [*73]  baseless in the sense that no reasonable litigant 
could realistically expect success on the merits,"" and (2) conceal ""an attempt to interfere directly with the business relationships 
of a competitor."" Prof'l Real Estate Investors, Inc. v. Columbia Pictures Indus., Inc., 508 U.S. 49, 60-61, 113 S. Ct. 1920, 123 L. 
Ed. 2d 611 (1993). "
992,21," See Def. Joint Mem. at 37; Pl. Opp. at 67. The Court therefore relies on the federal standards set forth pursuant to the 
Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1. "
993,22, See more detailed discussion infra pp. 46-48. 
994,23," Actavis and Teva additionally assert that Plaintiffs' claims against them fail as a matter of law because their settlements with 
Takeda could not have caused Plaintiffs' alleged injury. See Actavis and Teva Mem. at 2. In light of the Court's conclusion that 
Plaintiffs have failed to sufficiently allege causation as to all of the Defendants, it need not address this argument. "
995,24," Another case may present circumstances where the generic's success in the patent litigation was less speculative. For 
instance, in In re Niaspan, the court held that plaintiffs' theory of causation based on likely success in the underlying patent 
litigation was sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss. 42 F. Supp. 3d at 755-57; see also In re Ciprofloxacin Hydrochloride, 
261 F. Supp. 2d at 211-12. In contrast to the allegations here, however, the plaintiffs in that case alleged a reverse payment as 
well as specific facts evincing that the generic was ""confident that it would ultimately prevail"" in the patent litigation, including that 
the generic had begun preparing to launch at-risk as soon as it obtained final FDA approval and [*86]  that stock prices for the 
brand had dropped as a result. 42 F. Supp. 3d at 756."
995,25," Although the court in In re Barer Corp. Combination Aspirin Products Mktg. & Sales Practices Litig., a case cited by Plaintiffs in 
their brief, found ""cursory"" allegations linking the defendants' conduct to certain state statutes to be sufficient, that complaint 
contained significantly more specific allegations regarding the consumer protection statutes in the states where the named 
plaintiffs resided as well as separate conduct that purportedly violated those laws. 701 F. Supp. 2d 356, 378-79 (E.D.N.Y. 
2010)). "
996,26," In any event, an autonomous claim would fail here because ""autonomous restitution only exists in the absence of a violation of 
law,"" and here, the conduct alleged is governed by federal and state antitrust laws. In re Digital Music Antitrust Litig., 812 F. 
Supp. 2d at 412."
996,27," Because the Court concludes that the CAC does not state a claim for relief, it declines to address Defendants' state-specific 
arguments for dismissal, including their argument that Plaintiffs lack standing as indirect purchasers under certain states' laws. "
1007,1," The Supreme Court illustrated its understanding of reverse payment settlements as follows: Company A sues Company B for patent infringement. The two companies settle under terms that require (1) Company B, 
the claimed infringer, not to produce the patented product until the patent's term expires, and (2) Company A, the patentee, 
to pay B many millions of dollars. Because the settlement requires the patentee to pay the alleged infringer, rather than the 
other way around, this kind of settlement agreement is often called a ""reverse payment"" settlement agreement. Actavis, 133 S.Ct. at 2227. "
1008,2," All facts herein are taken in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs, however, rely on a great [**11]  deal of 
speculation in their recitation of the relevant facts; the Court will not consider the plaintiffs' speculation in deciding these motions. 
Summary judgment cannot be avoided by relying on speculation, and ""inference based on speculation...does not create a 
material factual dispute."" Robertson v. Allied Sig., Inc., 914 F.2d 360, 383 (3d Cir. 1990). "
1009,3, The volume is officially known as the Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalents Evaluations. 
1010,4," On May 11, 2012, the Court found that the patent infringement actions brought by Biovail and GSK were not sham lawsuits and 
could not be the basis for antitrust liability. Wellbutrin XL, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 66312, 2012 WL 1657734 at *17."

1011,6," As the Court explained in detail in its decision granting summary judgment on the plaintiffs' sham litigation claims, FDA 
regulations require ANDA applicants to list all components used in the manufacture of the drug product, regardless of whether 
they appear in the drug product, as well as a statement of the composition of the [**19]  drug product. 21 C.F.R. § 314.50. ANDA 
applicants must also ""identify and characterize the inactive ingredients in the proposed drug product."" Id. § 314.94(a)(9) (ii). In 
2003, the FDA issued a ""Guidance for Industry"" that states: The function (i.e., role) of each component in the formulation should be stated. Components that are used in the 
manufacture of the drug product and do not appear in the finished drug product except at residual levels (e.g., some 
solvents) should be identified as processing agents. The target amount of each component by definite weight or other measure should be provided on a per unit basis."
1011,2003," FDA Guidance at 8. Thus, in its pre-NDA submission to the FDA, the brand manufacturers of the original Wellbutrin IR had 
quantified a target amount per tablet of 0.5 mg of hydrochloric acid in the 50 mg formulation and 1.0 mg in the 100 mg 
formulation of Wellbutrin IR. Similarly, the NDA submitted for Wellbutrin SR indicated a target amount per tablet of 16.20 mg of 
cysteine hydrochloride, a different kind of acid stabilizer. The instruction to quantify the target amount of each component does 
not apply, however, to ""processing agents."" 2003 FDA Guidance 9. The FDA guidance does not clearly define 
""processing [**20]  agent."" See In re Wellbutrin XL Antitrust Litig., 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 66312, 2012 WL 1657734 at *9-11. "
1012,7," In November 2006, Andrx was acquired by Watson Pharmaceuticals; Watson had filed an ANDA to market generic 150mg 
Wellbutrin XL. Andrx was therefore not a ""non-practicing"" entity incapable of getting injunctive relief, as the plaintiffs have 
claimed. GSK Ex. 24."
1012,8," The Court previously found that Biovail's citizen petition was not an independent basis for antitrust liability. In re Wellbutrin XL 
Antitrust Litig., 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 66312, 2012 WL 1657734 (E.D.Pa. May 11, 2012). "
1013,9," Anchen was a new company and, at the time it filed its ANDA for generic Wellbutrin XL, it [**25]  had never launched or 
received FDA approval for a product. GSK Stmt. ¶ 21; Pls.' Stmt. Opp. ¶ 21."
1013,10," In January 2006, Anchen had entered into an agreement with Teva and Impax whereby it allowed Teva to market any generic 
300mg Wellbutrin XL made under Anchen's ANDA. If Anchen could not manufacture 300mg generic Wellbutrin XL, then Anchen 
would either relinquish its 180-day exclusivity or waive that exclusivity in favor of Impax. GSK Stmt. ¶ 23; Pls.' Stmt. Opp. ¶ 23. Biovail had not filed an infringement action against Impax within the 45-day window provided by the Hatch-Waxman Act, so no 
30-month stay of approval applied. Pls. Ex. 803; Pls. Stmt. Opp. ¶ 9, 23."
1013,11," The plaintiffs' assertion that there was ""no regulatory block to manufacturing and selling"" Anchen's generic Wellbutrin XL is 
contradicted by the record. Pls. Opp'n at 11. Although the plaintiffs have argued that the Goodyear and Jeronimo facilities 
were [**27]  the ""same facility"" for FDA inspection purposes, and that Anchen believed such a change only needed to be 
reported in Anchen's annual report to the FDA, both the FDA's and Anchen's conduct suggests otherwise. It is undisputed that 
upon learning of the manufacturing site change, the FDA in fact required Anchen to request, and Anchen did request, prior 
regulatory approval. GSK Ex. 72. "
1014,12," Biovail separately settled the Abrika litigation later. The Abrika settlement allowed for entry upon the expiration of Anchen's 
180-day exclusivity period and there was no payment made in exchange for the agreement. Abrika received final FDA approval 
to market its 150mg version of generic Wellbutrin XL on August 15, 2008. GSK Stmt. ¶ 55; Pls.' Stmt. Opp. ¶ 55."
1014,13," Prior to GSK's direct participation, GSK and Biovail had discussed the rights GSK may waive in a settlement and had shared 
draft settlement documents prior to GSK's actual involvement in settlement negotiations. For example, in early 2006 GSK 
informed Biovail that it was willing to ""waive certain valuable rights to facilitate Biovail's desire to settle certain patent litigation,"" 
including its right to market an authorized generic. On December 16, 2006, counsel for GSK and Biovail discussed the 
settlement negotiations; on December 17, 2006, GSK received a draft of the settlement from Biovail for review. GSK Stmt. ¶ 56-
57, 59; Pls.' Stmt. Opp. ¶ 56-57, 59."
1014,14," The Wellbutrin Settlement also resolved the Watson litigation. The Watson settlement allowed for entry after Anchen's 180-day 
exclusivity period expired. Watson had received final FDA approval to market is 150mg version of generic Wellbutrin XL on 
January 31, 2007. "
1015,15," The plaintiffs argued in their opposition to GSK's motion for summary judgment that it was inappropriate for GSK not to notify 
the Federal [**32]  Circuit that it had reached a settlement. It is unclear, however, how this is relevant to the antitrust question 
currently before the Court."
1015,16," The Wellbutrin Settlement included seven total ""triggers"" for generic entry. See GSK Ex. 6 at 3.16."
1015,17," The plaintiffs also rely [**33]  on GSK and Biovail's 2007 SEC 20-F filings, which described the settlement as ""allowing generic 
entry for the 150mg form in 2008."" Pls. Exs. 698, 696. The filings, however, were made in February and March of 2008, 
respectively, so at that point it would have been impossible for the companies to report anything other than a 2008 generic 
launch."
1015,18," Teva's antitrust counsel explained that it was Teva's ""publicly stated"" view at the time of the settlement that the Hatch-
Waxman Act intended that ""the first filing generic would be the only generic on the market."" Holding Dep. Tr. 73:24-74:17. "
1016,19," The plaintiffs do not offer factual support for their allegation that ""suddenly, and without explanation, the '708 patent license 
'got put into'"" the Wellbutrin Settlement. Rather, the generic manufacturers contemplated that the Wellbutrin Settlement would 
resolve the Andrx litigation. See Pls. Ex. 864; GSK Ex. 64. Further, the plaintiffs make much of the fact that Andrx and Anchen may have possibly negotiated a settlement separate from 
the Wellbutrin Settlement. [**37]  It is undisputed, however, that such a settlement was never memorialized or reached. These points serve as examples of the speculation the Court cannot consider in deciding the motions for summary judgment."
1016,20," Anchen told Andrx that it was planning a January 12, 2007 at risk launch of its 150mg product; Anchen said it was using its 
potential launch to facilitate settlement discussions with Andrx. GSK Stmt. ¶ 45; Pls.' Stmt. Opp. ¶ 45."
1016,21," In an email from Teva's General Counsel to counsel for Biovail and GSK, Teva's counsel stated that ""[t]he supply commitment 
can't be more watered down and useless — this wasn't the intent."" Pls. Ex. 886. "
1017,22," The plaintiffs offer no factual support for their allegation that the parties to the Wellbutrin Settlement misled the FTC. It is 
undisputed that the FTC was provided with the entire Wellbutrin Settlement; the plaintiffs criticize the parties for failing to provide 
a ""summary"" of the agreements to the FTC, but it is unclear what benefit this would have had when the agency had access to 
the entire agreement. The parties to the settlement also met with both the head of and the deputy assistant director to the FTC's 
Health Care Division, which is specifically tasked with reviewing Hatch-Waxman patent settlement agreements. Holding Dep. Tr. 
40:19-43:2. "
1018,23," The Court approved Biovail's settlement with the plaintiff classes on November 7, 2012, leaving GSK as the only defendant 
remaining in the case."
1018,24," HN6[
] Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56, a party moving for summary judgment must show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that judgment is appropriate as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The moving party bears 
the initial burden of demonstrating the absence of any genuine issue of material fact. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 
323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). Once a properly supported motion for summary judgment is made, the burden 
shifts to the nonmoving party, who must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. Anderson v. Liberty 
Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 250, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). The mere existence of some alleged factual dispute 
between the parties will not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment. Id. at 247-48. The Court's analysis applies to both the plaintiffs' federal and state law claims except where otherwise noted."
1018,25," In its motion for summary judgment, GSK also argued that Actavis does not apply to non-cash payments. This argument has 
been foreclosed by the Third Circuit's ruling in King Drug Co. of Florence, Inc. v. Smithkline Beecham, Corp., in which the court 
found that a no authorized generic agreement ""falls under Actavis's rule because it may well represent an unusual, unexplained 
reverse transfer of considerable value from the patentee to the alleged infringer and may therefore give rise to the inference that 
it is a payment to eliminate the risk of competition."" 791 F.3d 388 at 393, (3d Cir. 2015)."
1018,26," Because the Court has found that the Wellbutrin Settlement as a whole is not anticompetitive, it is not necessary to address 
whether [**46]  these settlements — which were negotiated entry date only settlements in which no payment was made — are a 
basis for recovery. "
1020,27," In the event the Anchen litigation was not concluded before May 2008, or was concluded in favor of Biovail, a trigger date 
provided for the market entry of generic Wellbutrin XL. "
1021,28," In their briefs and at oral argument, the plaintiffs made much of the fact that the no authorized generic agreement may be 
valued at ""$200 million."" GSK has not moved for summary judgment on any grounds related to the value of the no authorized 
agreement, however, so the plaintiffs continued reliance on it is misplaced."
1021,29," The plaintiffs offer no evidence to support their speculative claim that the ""only reason"" the Wellbutrin Settlement allowed the 
underlying patent litigation to continue was that it maintained Anchen's 180-day exclusivity period. The plaintiffs' expert Dr. 
Blume merely restates the Hatch-Waxman statutory scheme, which specifically allows a generic manufacturer to maintain its 
180-day exclusivity period without launching so long as an appeal remains pending. See 21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(5)(D)(i)(I)(bb)(AA)."
1021,30," The Court is not aware of any other post-Actavis reverse payment patent settlement evaluated by courts that allowed the 
underlying patent litigation to continue, maintaining the risk of patent invalidity or a finding of non-infringement. "
1022,31," Although at oral argument the plaintiffs' counsel denied that he was advocating a presumption-based [**59]  analysis, the 
plaintiffs' argument that they can demonstrate anticompetitive effects by showing a ""large"" payment and a delay appears to be 
such an analysis. See Oral Arg. Tr. at 58 (""A payment that the evidence shows is for delay that's large satisfies our first step."")"
1022,32," The plaintiffs have relied on King Drug of Florence, Inc. v. Cephalon, Inc. to support their argument that their required showing 
of anticompetitive effects is satisfied by showing a large payment. 88 F. Supp. 3d 402, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9545, 2015 WL 
356913 at *10 (E.D. Pa. Jan. 28, 2015)(""evidence of a large payment is required for a plaintiff to satisfy its initial burden of 
demonstrating anticompetitive effects under the Actavis rule of reason analysis.""). The court in King Drug, however, was not 
faced with a settlement similar to the Wellbutrin Settlement. Rather, the court was evaluating a settlement that had ended the 
underlying patent litigation; the court, therefore, was faced the Wellbutrin Settlement allowed it to continue. As Actavis explained, 
the elimination of the risk of a patent litigation loss is the relevant harm in a rule of reason analysis. "
1023,33," The plaintiffs cite deposition testimony from three GSK witnesses: CEO Jean-Pierre Garnier, General Counsel Rupert Brondy, 
and Vice President Jack Davis. Davis testified that ""there was a delay that [Teva] agreed to until, I believe, it was May 30th of 
2008, or some earlier date, depending on some triggers which I don't know what those are."" Davis Dep. Tr. 99:8-18. The 
plaintiffs failed to refer, however, [**61]  to Davis's subsequent testimony that he could not testify to the specific relationship 
between the no authorized generic agreement and the negotiated trigger dates because he ""wasn't involved in any of those 
conversations."" Id. at 100:5-14. Similarly, Bondy testified that the fact that GSK would continue marketing 150mg Wellbutrin XL 
for a period of time without generic competition was a ""significant term of the agreements."" Bondy Dep. Tr. 110:15-19. Finally, 
Garnier testified that GSK ""[sold] its exclusivity"" back to Biovail to facilitate the settlement of the underlying patent litigation. 
Garnier 142:16-145:3."
1023,34," The plaintiffs also cite a March 2007 internal GSK presentation that noted that as a result of the ""deal"" Teva would not market 
a generic Wellbutrin XL product until a ""trigger date"" and that GSK was barred from launching an authorized generic during the 
180-day Hatch-Waxman exclusivity period. See Pls. Ex. 971. Although the document does address both elements of the deal, it 
does not present the ""quid pro quo"" that the plaintiffs suggest."
1023,35," Such a showing may, however, satisfy the plaintiffs' prima facie burden under the Cartwright Act. In re Cipro Cases I & II, 61 
Cal. 4th 116, 187 Cal. Rptr. 3d 632, 348 P.3d 845 (2015). As discussed below, however, the Wellbutrin [**62]  Settlement is not 
anticompetitive under the Court's full rule of reason analysis given the settlements procompetitive justifications."
1023,36," GSK has filed a Daubert motion to exclude Dr. Leitzinger's testimony regarding a rule of reason analysis of the 
Wellbutrin [**63]  Settlement on the grounds that Leitzinger has rested his analysis exclusively on counsel's instructions rather 
than an independent analysis of the summary judgment record. The Court can decide GSK's motion for summary judgment, however, without deciding GSK's Daubert challenge of Dr. 
Leitzinger, because the Court relies on the undisputed facts in the summary judgment record. That said, Dr. Leitzinger's analysis 
of the Wellbutrin Settlement's effects are unreliable under Daubert and are excluded. Dr. Leitziner failed to analyze when and 
whether the generic manufacturers would have entered the market but for the Wellbutrin Settlement. Further, Dr. Leitzinger 
expressly failed to evaluate any procompetitive justifications of the Wellbutrin Settlement, making his already conclusory analysis 
fatally incomplete. Dr. Leitzinger's opinion is reciting only the plaintiffs' counsels' argument that the settlement is anticompetitive. 
His testimony regarding anticompetitive effects is unreliable. "
1024,37," Although the Lamictal court noted that it is not necessary at the motion to dismiss stage for the plaintiffs to present an 
alternate settlement scenario in order to establish [**64]  anticompetitive effects, Lamictal, 791 F.3d at 410 (addressing the 
plaintiffs' burden at the motion to dismiss stage and finding that Actavis does not ""require allegations that defendants could in 
fact have reached another, more competitive settlement.""), it is one mechanism through which the plaintiffs may establish 
anticompetitive effects at the summary judgment stage."
1024,38," GSK's contention that there is no evidence in the summary judgment record that it would have independently launched an 
authorized generic is not persuasive as to the lack of anticompetitive effects at the summary judgment stage. It was the promise 
of the no authorized generic, not only the failure of GSK to actually launch an authorized generic, that the plaintiffs claim caused 
the alleged anticompetitive effects in the form of delayed market entry for generic Wellbutrin XL. Even if the Court found that 
GSK had not planned to launch an authorized generic Wellbutrin XL product, there is no dispute that GSK made the promise 
that it would not do so. "
1027,39," There is no support in the summary judgment record for the plaintiffs' contention that the parties to the Wellbutrin Settlement 
concealed the nature of the settlement from the FTC. Rather, there is undisputed evidence in the summary judgment record that 
the parties to the settlement presented the entire settlement agreement to the FTC and met with the agency to explain the 
settlement."
1027,40," Another reason why the Court has not considered the FTC's decisions to the Wellbutrin Settlement as evidence of either the 
lack of anticompetitive effects or the procompetitive nature of the settlement is that it is unlikely that the FTC's decision itself 
would be admissible on these topics. The circumstances surrounding the inclusion of the review provisions in the Wellbutrin 
Settlement and the submission of the settlement to the FTC, however, would be admissible at trial on a number of bases, 
including intent and the fact that enhanced FTC review had at least indirect procompetitive benefits. "
1028,41," Antitrust injury and causation are two essential elements of the doctrine of antitrust standing; the lack of antitrust standing 
prevents a plaintiff from recovering from the antitrust laws. Assoc. Gen. Contractors of Calif., Inc., v. California State Council of 
Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 103 S. Ct. 897, 74 L. Ed. 2d 723; Ethypharm S.A. France v. Abbott Labs., 707 F.3d 223, 232-33 (3d 
Cir. 2013). If antitrust injury and causation are lacking, the Court does not need to address the remaining factors of antirust 
standing."
1028,42," The Third Circuit in Lamictal did not address the issue of antitrust injury. Lamictal, 791 F.3d at 410 n.35 (""we do not decide the 
question of antitrust injury in private actions such as this litigation...nor do we preclude the parties from raising the issue on 
remand."")(citing Ian Simmons et al., Viewing Actavis Through The Lens of Clayton Act Section 4, Antitrust, Fall 2013, at 24). No 
other federal court of appeals has addressed the issue of antitrust injury in the context of reverse payment settlements. "
1029,43," The plaintiffs have mistakenly characterized GSK's argument that the patent cuts off the chain of causation as an ""illegality 
defense"" to antitrust claims. Courts have rejected such [**82]  a defense. See Consolidated Exp., Inc. v. New York Shipping 
Ass'n, 602 F.2d 494, 525-26 (3d Cir., 1979) (citing Perma Life Mufflers, Inc. v. Int'l Parts Corp., 392 U.S. 134, 88 S. Ct. 1981, 20 
L. Ed. 2d 982 (1968) (finding that the unclean hands defense was not applicable to antitrust violations)). GSK, however, is 
arguing that an independent regulation cut off the chain of causation that the plaintiffs are attempting to establish. The court in 
Consolidated Exp., Inc. did not address the issue of causation. It found only that the plaintiffs' violation of an unrelated law or 
regulation could not serve as a complete bar to antitrust liability. Notably, this case predates the Third Circuit's decision in City of 
Pittsburgh v. West Penn. Power."
1029,44, Private plaintiffs cannot bring actions under the FTC Act. 
1030,45," The Court is not persuaded by the district court and California Supreme Court decisions that found that causation is satisfied 
by showing that the defendants' actions ended the patent litigation, making it unnecessary to consider the patent's validity. In re 
Cipro Cases I&II, 61 Cal. 4th 116, 159, 187 Cal. Rptr. 3d 632, 348 P.3d 845 (2015)(""nothing in the United States Supreme 
Court's discussion of the legal rules at the boundary between antitrust and patent law hinged on the happenstance that the case 
under review involved a public prosecutor.""); In re Aggrenox Antitrust Litig., No. 14-2516, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 94516, 2015 WL 
4459607 at *9 (D. Conn. July 21, 2015). It appears [**86]  to the Court that these decisions relax Section 4's causation 
requirement for the specific circumstance of challenges to reverse payment settlements. Additionally, even in Actavis, a case 
brought under the FTC Act, the Supreme Court said only that it is normally not necessary to litigate patent validity, not that such 
litigation would never be necessary. The Court, however, is bound by the In re Cipro Cases decision in evaluating the indirect purchaser plaintiffs' claims under the 
California's Cartwright Act. Because the Court, however, has found that the Wellbutrin Settlement is not anticompetitive under 
the rule of reason, this does not alter the outcome of the summary judgment motion."
1030,46," The plaintiffs have relied on Andrx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Biovail Corp. Intl., 256 F.3d 799, 347 U.S. App. D.C. 178 (D.C. Cir. 
2001) and In re Cardizem CD Antitrust Litigation, 332 F.3d 896 (6th Cir. 2003), to support their argument that an at risk 
launch [**87]  can support antitrust injury without evidence of success on the underlying patent claim. But neither case is 
persuasive in this context. Both cases were evaluating complaints at the motion to dismiss stage under a per se analysis. Both 
cases also predate — and are in conflict with — the Supreme Court's decision in Actavis (and the Third Circuit's decision in 
Lamictal) which control this decision. "
1031,47," The plaintiffs also challenge the reliability of Dr. Adelman's methodologies with respect to his opinions on the Biovail litigation. 
These challenges go to the weight of Dr. Adelman's testimony, not its admissibility. Because the Court finds in the plaintiffs' favor 
on the Biovail litigation, the plaintiffs' objections on this basis are moot. "
1032,48," Instead, they argue [**92]  that Anchen/Teva would have reached a license agreement with Andrx. As discussed above, 
however, no license agreement exists between the parties and there is no evidence in the summary judgment record that an 
agreement would have been reached absent the Wellbutrin Settlement."
1032,49," The plaintiffs' assertion that no law prohibited its production is counter to both FDA regulations and Anchen's conduct in 
response to FDA action. "
1033,50," Despite being given the opportunity, the plaintiffs declined to ask any witness from Anchen/Teva whether an at risk launch 
after June 2007 was planned. Instead, the plaintiffs chose to rely only on the documents that do not address the issue one way 
or another. See Oral Arg. Tr. at 68-69."
1033,51," Because the Court will grant summary judgment on other grounds, there is no need for the Court also to decide this issue. But 
in an effort to be complete, the Court has considered all bases for summary judgment. "
1034,52," Although the defendants can argue — and have successfully argued — that the Wellbutrin [**100]  Settlement is not 
anticompetitive, there is no question that GSK intended to participate in the settlement negotiations. "
1042,1," Given the summary judgment posture of the case, this discussion of the facts resolves all disputed issues in favor [**3]  of 
Sanger, the nonmovant."
1042,2," ""HUB"" refers collectively to HUB International, Limited, and HUB International Midwest, Limited. "
1043,3, Bear also served as the general manager of Donnell's veterinary practice.
1043,4," Sanger also brought claims under section 3 of the Clayton Act, but later abandoned them. "
1044,5," HN3[
] A plaintiff who has not suffered an injury in fact traceable to the defendant's conduct also lacks Article III standing. See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560, 112 S. Ct. 2130, 119 L. Ed. 2d 351 (1992). Although Article III standing's 
traceability requirement is less strict than antitrust standing's proximate cause requirement, see K.P. v. LeBlanc, 627 F.3d 115, 
123 (5th Cir. 2010) (""Tracing an injury is [**11]  not the same as seeking its proximate cause""), a plaintiff's preparedness to enter 
a market bears on both Article III and antitrust standing because it goes to whether the plaintiff suffered an injury in fact, cf. Joint 
Stock Soc'y v. UDV N. Am., Inc., 266 F.3d 164, 176 (3d Cir. 2001) (holding that plaintiffs who had not begun to market their 
product and were not prepared to do so lacked Article III standing for false advertising claims). "
1045,6," Some other courts have subsumed the injury-in-fact and proximate cause component under the ""efficient enforcer"" or ""proper 
plaintiff"" element of the standing test. See, e.g., Sunbeam Television, 711 F.3d at 1272 (analyzing preparedness as a question 
of the plaintiff's status as an ""efficient enforcer""). "
1046,7," The district court's ruling on preparedness grounds likely came [**16]  as a surprise to Sanger, as HUB's motion for summary 
judgment addressed the issue in a single short paragraph. "
1048,8," This primary concern followed from a ""widespread view [**25]  that it is very difficult to underwrite risks in an informed and 
responsible way without intra-industry cooperation."" Grp. Life & Health Ins. Co. v. Royal Drug Co., 440 U.S. 205, 221, 99 S. Ct. 
1067, 59 L. Ed. 2d 261 (1979). "
1050,9," ""Bluntly stated, an 'insurance agent' represents the insurance company, whereas an 'insurance broker' represents the insured."" 
7 Appleman on Insurance 2d: Law of Insurance Agents § 47.5, at 326 (1998) (footnotes omitted). "
1051,10," Sanger also claims that HUB's agreements with the American Veterinary Medical Association constitute [**37]  contracts, 
combinations, or conspiracies in restraint of trade, but it does not appear to claim that the Association had a role in any alleged 
boycott. "
1052,11," Sanger contends that HUB and the insurers' refusal to deal is a boycott under the definition used inKlor's, Inc. v. Broadway-
Hale Stores, Inc., 359 U.S. 207, 79 S. Ct. 705, 3 L. Ed. 2d 741 (1959). In that case, a retail chain used its ""'monopolistic' buying 
power to bring about"" a conspiracy with manufacturers and distributers of appliances to exclude Klor's, an independent retailer, 
from selling their brands. Id. at 209. The Court characterized the conspiracy as a group boycott forbidden by the Sherman Act, 
though the opinion does not disclose any ""collateral transaction"" involved. Id. at 209-11. To the extent Klor's conflicts with 
Hartford Fire, we follow the latter case, which is the only one that involves the McCarran-Ferguson Act's boycott exception. See 
Hartford Fire, 509 U.S. at 803 (""The proper definition of 'boycott' is evident from the Court's opinion in Eastern States Retail 
Lumber . . . . [T]he associations' activities were a boycott because they sought an objective—the wholesale dealers' forbearance 
from retail trade—that was collateral to their transactions with the wholesalers.""); but see NYNEX Corp. v. Discon, Inc., 525 U.S. 
128, 134-37, 119 S. Ct. 493, 142 L. Ed. 2d 510 (1998) (citing and relying upon Klor's in a non-insurance case)."
1052,12," It is not necessary to decide [**38]  whether coercion and intimidation likewise require concerted action, because Sanger 
disavows any argument that HUB engaged in coercion or intimidation. We note that the few courts to have addressed this issue 
are divided, although the leading treatise concludes that concerted activity is likely required to establish coercion or intimidation. 
Areeda & Hovenkamp, supra, ¶ 220a, at 36 (citing cases). "
1053,13," Texas law actually permits plaintiffs to recover for tortious interference even when they would not have standing to assert the 
underlying tort. See Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Sturges, 52 S.W.3d 711, 726 (Tex. 2001) (""[A] plaintiff may recover for tortious 
interference from a defendant who threatens a person with physical harm if he does business with the plaintiff. The plaintiff need 
prove only that the defendant's conduct toward the prospective customer would constitute assault.""). But whether Sanger 
suffered injury—the same inquiry involved in the preparedness determination under the antitrust laws—likely bears on 
""reasonable probability"" and ""injury"" elements of a tortious interference claim. "
1055,1," The majority's hedging on Sanger's preparedness to enter other markets affords the possibility that, on remand, standing can 
be summarily denied vis a vis markets outside Texas. "
1068,1, The Court assumes the truth of Plaintiff's factual allegations solely for the purpose of deciding the motion to dismiss. 
1077,1," At the appropriate time, UTC intends to file a Non-Product Motion for Summary Judgment in this case raising the 
issue of non-corporate liability, in addition to employer and premises claim-related defenses, including lack of duty. "
1150,1," Defendants include Wilmington Trust, NA, Successor Trustee to Citibank, N.A., as Trustee F/B/O Holders of Structured Asset 
Mortgage Investments II Inc., Bear Stearns Alt-A Trust 2007-3, Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2007-3, 
(""Wilmington""), JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and SPS. "
1151,2," Chase's argument that Plaintiffs have not alleged a UCL violation against Chase with requisite specificity generally challenges 
whether Plaintiffs have alleged more than ""unsupported conclusions."" (Doc. No. 9-1, p. 3-4.) This argument is therefore 
addressed with respect to Plaintiffs' allegations under each prong of the UCL."
1151,3," 12 U.S.C. § 2605(b)(1) governs notice requirements in connection with the assignment, sale, or transfer of the servicing of a 
loan."
1151,4," Plaintiffs do allege that SPS violated § 2605, but this statutory reference is omitted from Plaintiffs' allegations against Chase. 
(See Doc. No. 1-2, ¶ 64.) "
1162,1," Vitol requests oral argument on its motion to dismiss. Docket No. 213. But because of the huge number of parties and discrete 
legal issues, I believe holding arguments would generate more heat than light and would not assist me in my decision. I thus 
DENY Vitol's request. "
1163,2," Specifically, the PREPA Participants are made up of the following defendants: PREPA; William Rodney Clark, the administrator 
of PREPA's Fuel Procurement Office from 1996 until May 2014; Edwin Rodríguez, the manager of PREPA's Fuel Procurement 
Office after May 2014; and Cesar Torres-Marrero, the Assistant Manager of PREPA's Fuel Procurement Office since May 2014."
1163,3," Specifically, this group is made up of the following Defendants: Petrobras America Inc. and its parent company, Petroleo 
Brasileiro S.A. (collectively referred to as ""Petrobras""); Shell Trading (US) Co. (""Shell Trading""); Trafigura A.G. and Trafigura 
Beheer B.V. (collectively, ""Trafigura""); PetroWest, Inc.; Vitol, S.A., and Vitol, Inc. (collectively, ""Vitol""); and Carlos Méndez & 
Associates (""Méndez"")."
1163,4," Specifically, this group is made up of the following Defendants: Inspectorate America Corp. (""Inspectorate""); Bureau Veritas 
Holding, Inc. (""Bureau Veritas""); Core Laboratories [*9]  N.V. d/b/a Saybolt (""Saybolt""); and Altol Chemical Environmental 
Laboratory Inc. and Altol Environmental Services, Inc. (collectively, ""Alchem""). "
1164,5," Plaintiffs allege that because samples are only held for ninety days, it would have been impossible for Ivan Clark to have tested 
so many. Internal auditors allegedly concluded that Ivan Clark's audit was illegitimate. "
1165,6, I consider these allegations—and [*14]  the potential problems with them—in more detail infra § 2.2.3.4.
1165,7," Oddly, PetroWest also argues that the Complaint should be dismissed because it contains ""allegations that are evidently based 
on hearsay."" Docket No. 108, at 29. Unsurprisingly, PetroWest fails to cite any authority purporting to hold that allegations in a 
complaint may not be based on hearsay. See, e.g., Muzaffarr v. Ross Dress For Less, Inc., Civ. No. 12-61996, 2013 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 66160, 2013 WL 1890274, at *2 (S.D. Fla. May 7, 2013) (""[T]here is no rule against hearsay statements in pleadings.""). "
1166,8," In the course of making this argument, Alchem [*17]  referred (but accidentally did not attach) a settlement-negotiation letter 
from Plaintiffs' counsel. See Docket No. 182. Plaintiffs, quite correctly, complained that this constituted a breach of their 
confidentiality agreement. Docket No. 185. Alchem then gratuitously filed the letter without any viewing restrictions, knowing full 
well of the confidentiality agreement and Plaintiffs' wish to enforce it. Docket No. 190. I GRANT IN PART Plaintiffs' motion at 
Docket Nos. 186; GRANT its motion at Docket No.187 and Alchem's motions at Docket No. 206 and 2011; STRIKE the filing at 
Docket No. 190; and deny further sanctions, with the caveat that I find the conduct of Alchem's counsel, Thomas Trebilcock-
Horan, troubling. See also infra note 9."
1166,9," In its reply, Alchem claims that it did not request sanctions against Plaintiffs for a Rule 11 violation. Docket No. 182, at 5. This is 
false: Alchem asked that the Complaint be dismissed as a consequence of a Rule 11 violation; this would, obviously, constitute a 
sanction. Ironically, in accusing Plaintiffs of violating Rule 11, Alchem moreover appears to have violated the Rule itself. Rule 11(c)(2) 
requires that before moving for Rule 11 sanctions, the aggrieved party must be served on the adverse party but not filed until 21 
days later or if the adverse party withdraws the contention at issue. Alchem failed to abide by this provision, and so its motion 
should be denied for that reason as well. "
1167,10," In writing this opinion, I rely frequently on Trafigura's motion to dismiss because it is the best-written and most comprehensive 
of the motions pending before the Court. Because all of the motions make many common arguments, it has served as 
something of an exemplar in understanding the defendants' [*23]  positions. I note, however, that the other motions are not more "
1168,," comprehensive in their accounting of the putative ""storm warnings""; most, in fact, cite precisely the same information, including 
the same news article and bond offering."
1168,11," Staehr, Cohen, and Holmes are all securities fraud cases. In that context, there is substantial precedent establishing that 
investors should be assumed to be aware of prospectuses, media, and other information about their investments. See, e.g., 
Staehr v. Hartford Fin. Servs. Grp., Inc., 547 F.3d 406, 431 (2d Cir. 2008). This seems to be based in part on the ""sophisticated"" 
nature of such individuals. See, e.g., AIG Global Sec. Lending Corp. v. Banc of Am. Sec. LLC, 646 F. Supp. 2d 385, 410 
(S.D.N.Y. 2009), aff'd, 386 F. App'x 5 (2d Cir. 2010). This heightened standard of knowledge probably does not apply in the non-
securities fraud context, especially where, as here, the plaintiffs are ordinary consumers. See McIntyre v. United States, 367 
F.3d 38, 60 (1st Cir. 2004) (asking simply whether ""a reasonable person"" would have been aware of news coverage). And in 
applying a reasonable person analysis to the class of Puerto Rican electricity consumers it cannot be forgotten that Spanish is 
the first language of the vast majority of Puerto Ricans and the only language of many."
1168,12," The Complaint is vague about whether the 2002 Comptroller report was made public at the time, though at least one 
defendant asserts that it was. As for the internal audits to which Trafigura points, I read the Complaint to suggest they were not 
publicly disseminated, and neither Trafigura [*25]  or any other defendant has shown otherwise."
1168,13," This is a nearly 200-page, English-language document directed at investors considering investing in a particular PREPA bond 
offering, not consumers of power. It includes one paragraph noting that Puerto Rico's Comptroller had found that PREPA had 
overcharged its customers. The document does not explain the basis for this finding but does strongly imply that it was because 
the Comptroller had determined that PREPA had engaged in improper rate-setting (which PREPA disputed). Nothing in the note 
even hints at fraud in the purchase of fuel oil, which is the subject of this suit. I am thus doubtful that actual knowledge of this 
document would have put Plaintiffs on notice regarding the injuries they have asserted in this case."
1168,14," I am inclined to think that she should not be. The First Circuit has held that HN11[
] knowledge of media coverage can be 
imputed to a person when it is widespread. McIntyre v. United States, 367 F.3d 38, 60 (1st Cir. 2004). On the record now before 
the Court, I could not find that these facts were the subject of ""widespread publicity,"" [*27]  which is more properly a question for "
1169,," the finder of fact. Id. (internal quotations omitted); see also Fisher v. Ciba Specialty Chems. Corp., Civ. No. 03-0566, 2007 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 76174, 2007 WL 2995525, at *19 (S.D. Ala. Oct. 11, 2007) (""[T]he record evidence that Ciba contamination received 
substantial media attention during much of the period of concern raises a question of fact as tow whether that knowledge can be 
imputed to plaintiffs."")."
1169,15," I have not considered the articles filed for the first time with Petrobras's reply brief, see Docket No. 197, but if I did, it would not 
alter my fundamental conclusion: that the question of whether the parties had inquiry notice on the basis of news articles is a 
question for the finder of fact. Moreover, the facts related by the two articles deal with the pre-2002 fraud that Plaintiffs claim 
PREPA attempted to conceal."
1169,16," Though the defendants do not rely on them, I have considered and rejected an analogy to cases rejecting benefit-of-the-
bargain theories of damages. See, e.g., In re Toyota Motor Corp. Hybrid Brake Mktg., Sales Practices & Prods. Liability Litig., 
915 F. Supp. 2d 1151, 1158 (C.D. Cal. 2013). In Toyota Motor Corp., for example, the plaintiff sued regarding a nationwide 
problem in Toyota braking systems. See id. at 1157. Although his own car functioned properly, the plaintiff alleged that he would 
not have paid as much as he did if he had been aware of the problem. See id. at 1157-58. The court rejected that argument 
because the plaintiff received what he paid for: ""a [*30]  vehicle with a safe and operable"" braking system. Id. at 1159. Here, by 
contrast, Plaintiffs allege that they paid more for a product than it was worth. "
1170,17," Disappointingly, Edwin Rodríguez's and PREPA's briefs on this point are verbatim copies of Trafigura's brief."
1170,18," Notably, in Kansas v. UtiliCorp United, Inc., the Supreme Court referred to utility customers who paid passed-through fuel 
costs as purchasers of fuel. 497 U.S. 199, 207, 110 S. Ct. 2807, 111 L. Ed. 2d 169 (1990) (explaining that the utility customers 
""bought their gas from the utilities, not the suppliers"" (emphasis added)). For this reason, and because the Complaint specifically 
pleads otherwise, I reject the argument made by some defendants that Plaintiffs have not pled but-for causation. E.g., Docket 
No. 106, at 22 (""The problem with Plaintiffs' causal theory is that the Plaintiffs were purchasers of electricity, not fuel oil."" 
(emphasis omitted))."
1170,19," In a similar line of cases, the Courts have soundly rejected the notion that a business suffers no economic harm when it is able 
to pass an overcharge along to its own customers. Hanover Shoe, Inc. v. United Shoe Mach. Corp., 392 U.S. 481, 489, 88 S. Ct. 
2224, 20 L. Ed. 2d 1231 (1968) (""As long as the seller continues [*32]  to charge the illegal price, he takes from the buyer more 
than the law allows.""); Cnty. of Oakland v. City of Detroit, 866 F.2d 839, 847 (6th Cir. 1989) (holding that an injury is not 
""eradicated for constitutional standing purposes if the excessive charges were subsequently passed on"")."
1170,20," One could view PREPA's customers as paying apremium for electricity as a result of the 1999 Consent Decree, which 
mandated the purchase of more expensive fuel. In similar cases, courts have held that a customer is injured when he pays that 
premium price but unwittingly receives a less valuable product. In re Whirlpool Corporation Front-Loading Washer Prods. 
Liability Litig., 722 F.3d 838, 857 (6th Cir. 2013). Likewise Plaintiffs in this case argue that they were charged for the premium 
Compliant Fuel Oil but were in fact paying that premium price for the cheaper Non-Compliant Fuel Oil. "
1171,21," The closest the First Circuit has come to addressing this issue is In re New Motor Vehicles Canadian Export Antitrust 
Litigation, 533 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2008). There, the plaintiffs, lessees of new cars, sued the car manufacturers for restricting 
imports, which they said led to higher rental prices. See id. at 2. After their claim was dismissed under Illinois Brick, the plaintiffs 
tried to recast their complaint as having alleged a vertical, rather than purely horizontal, conspiracy, so as to avoid the Illinois 
Brick rule. See id. at 3. The court declined to decide whether it would follow the cases holding that victims of a vertical 
conspiracy are not indirect purchasers, instead holding that the plaintiffs' new arguments were contradicted by their pleadings. 
Id. at 4."
1171,22," Furthermore, because PREPA is a party to this case, if an adverse judgment is entered against it, that judgment would be 
preclusive in a suit by PREPA against the other defendants. Thus, the concerns about double recovery [*36]  that other courts 
have raised when the alleged co-conspirator is not a party do not apply. E.g., In re New Motor Vehicles Canadian Export 
Antitrust Litig., 307 F. Supp. 2d 136, 141 & n.5 (D. Me. 2004); see also In re New Motor Vehicles Canadian Export Antitrust 
Litig., 533 F.3d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir. 2008) (raising same concerns)."
1171,23," The defendants rely principally on Dickson v. Microsoft Corp., 309 F.3d 193 (4th Cir. 2002), and In re ATM Fee Litigation, 686 
F.3d 741 (9th Cir. 2012). Based on what I believe is a mis- or over-interpretation of UtiliCorp's and Illinois Brick's caution against 
creating exceptions for specific markets, e.g., UtiliCorp, 497 U.S. at 216-17, these cases have declined to one degree or another 
to make an ""exception"" to the Illinois Brick rule for plaintiffs paying inflated prices due to a conspiracy stretching vertically over a 
chain of distribution. Thus Dickson held that the ""exception"" applied, at most, to price-fixing conspiracies, 309 F.3d at 214-15, 
and In re ATM Fee held that it did not apply when the overcharge was not paid directly by the plaintiffs, even if it was passed to 
the plaintiffs through the conspiracy, 686 F.3d at 751-52. Essentially, I disagree that this case presents an ""exception"" to Illinois Brick rather than a fundamentally different factual 
scenario. Cf. Blue Shield of Va. v. McCready, 457 U.S. 465, 474-75, 102 S. Ct. 2540, 73 L. Ed. 2d 149 (1982) (declining to apply 
Illinois Brick where direct purchaser was not the injured party). Moreover, neither In re ATM Fee or Dickson explain who, if 
anyone, could sue for the overcharges alleged in each case. For these reasons, I would not follow either case [*37]  to the 
extent it conflicts with my analysis. See Laumann v. Nat'l Hockey League, 907 F. Supp. 2d 465, 480-83 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) 
(declining to follow In re ATM Fee and holding that where the ""middlemen are alleged to be co-conspirators,"" the first purchasers 
outside of the conspiracy have standing to sue); see also Paper Sys. Inc. v. Nippon Paper Indus. Co., Ltd., 281 F.3d 629, 631 
(7th Cir. 2002); PHILIP E. AREEDA & HERBERT HOVENKAMP, ANTITRUST LAW 173, ¶ 346 (2005 supp.) (criticizing Dickson). "
1172,24," Trafigura and others argue that because they did not directly sell oil to PREPA, but rather did so through intermediaries, 
Plaintiffs are even more remote victims than were the consumers in UtiliCorp. E.g., Docket No. 82, at 17 n.4. This argument fails 
because Plaintiffs were nonetheless the first [*38]  and intended victims of the overall conspiracy; in any case, this boils down to 
a proximate cause argument, McCready, 457 U.S. at 476, which I discuss (and reject) below."
1172,25," In Paper Systems the plaintiffs, resellers of fax paper, accused the paper's manufacturers and certain middlemen of conspiring 
to raise prices. See 281 F.3d at 631. The plaintiffs lost in the district court, which relied on UtiliCorp, but the Seventh Circuit 
reversed, holding that because the plaintiffs were ""the first purchasers from outside the conspiracy,"" they could sue and recover 
from ""both the manufacturers and their intermediaries"" so long as the conspiracy allegations could be proven. Id. at 631-32. I 
find Paper Systems, to which Plaintiffs cite in their brief, both analogous and persuasive. See also Howard Hess Dental Labs. 
Inc. v. Dentsply Int'l, Inc., 424 F.3d 363, 376-78 (3d Cir. 2004) (following Nippon); In re Auto. Parts Antitrust Litig., Civ. No. 12-
501, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 120719, 2014 WL 4272772, at *10 (E.D. Mich. Aug. 29, 2014) (same); Laumann, 907 F. Supp. 2d at 
482-83 (same); Crane v. Int'l Paper Co., Civ. No. 02-3352-22, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15590, 2005 WL 3627139, at *7-8 (D.S.C. 
April 19, 2005) (same)."
1172,26,"  Illinois Brick does not stand for the proposition, as the defendants would seem to have it, that a defendant cannot be sued 
under the antitrust laws by any plaintiff to whom it does not sell (or from whom it does not purchase. . . . The reason the 
plaintiffs' suit in Illinois Brick failed was not because the defendants did not sell to them. Rather, it was because the 
defendants did sell to a third party who (after [*39]  Hanover Shoe) could recover for any injury they claimed. Loeb Indus., Inc. v. Sumitomo Corp., 306 F.3d 469, 481-82 (7th Cir. 2002). See also HERBERT HOVENKAMP, FEDERAL 
ANTITRUST POLICY 679-80, § 16.6b3 (4th ed. 2011) (opining that when a plaintiff buys from an intermediary in a price-fixing 
conspiracy, ""he is not really an indirect purchaser, but a direct one"")."
1172,27," On the basis of the Complaint, I would not dismiss Plaintiffs' claims because of speculative and undeveloped arguments 
suggesting that damages will be too difficult to prove. E.g., Docket No. 110, at 18-19. The special damages problems presented 
in Illinois Brick and UtiliCorp are not present here, and while damages calculations would no doubt be complex, there is not at 
this time reason to think that this level of complexity would be so great so as to deny recovery. See Loeb Indus., 306 F.3d at 493 
(holding that courts regularly handle time-consuming and difficult damages calculations, and that they may do so where the 
damages are not ""inherently speculative"" or take the form of certain complex ""econometric analys[e]s""). "
1173,28, Other defendants simply generally argue that Plaintiffs failed to allege a common purpose. 
1174,29," Similarly, I am unpersuaded by the argument that no common purpose can be shown because PREPA, as a corporate entity, 
does not profit from the scheme. The Complaint alleges PREPA's knowledge of and participation in the Cartel, and its other 
reasons for participating are thus not relevant. See Nat'l Org. for Women, Inc. v. Scheidler, 510 U.S. 249, 256-262, 114 S. Ct. 
798, 127 L. Ed. 2d 99 (1994) (holding that RICO does not require an economic motive)."
1174,30," In addition to a common purpose, an association-in-fact need also have ""longevity sufficient to permit the associates to pursue 
the enterprise's purpose"" and ""relationships among the associates."" Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938, 939, 129 S. Ct. 2237, 
173 L. Ed. 2d 1265 (2009). Though some of the defendants perfunctorily argue that these elements are not satisfied, the 
Complaint gives substantial detail about the relationships between the defendants and the amount of time the scheme has been 
in operation."
1174,31," Without citing caselaw, Shell Trading argues that the Complaint must be dismissed because it has failed to allege ""the 
existence of a hierarchical structure"" within the enterprise or ""any mechanisms for decision-making."" Docket No. 110, at 27-28. 
But the Supreme Court—in cases that Shell Trading cites, id. at 26, 28—has explicitly rejected the argument that such features 
are necessary to an association-in-fact. Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938, 948, 129 S. Ct. 2237, 173 L. Ed. 2d 1265 (2009) 
(citing United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 101 S. Ct. 2524, 69 L. Ed. 2d 246 (1981)). It is thus difficult to believe that Shell 
Trading made this argument in good faith. See id. (holding [*47]  that an association-in-fact ""need not have a hierarchical 
structure or 'chain of command'"" and that ""decisions may be made on an ad hoc basis by any number of methods""). "
1175,32," By reference to a lawsuit where PREPA sued it to void certain contracts, Vitol argues that it has not sold fuel to PREPA since 
2012. Docket No. 106, at 12-13. But I cannot take judicial notice of any facts alleged or proved in a separate lawsuit, and so I "
1176,," must treat the Complaint's contrary allegations as controlling. See Int'l Shipping Agency, Inc. v. Unión de Trabajadores de 
Muelles Local 1740, Civ. No. 12-1996(SCC), 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 111299, 2015 WL 5022794, at *5 & n.4 (D.P.R. Aug. 21, 
2015)."
1176,33," See, e.g., Compl. ¶ 207 (over a period of several months in 2010, every Shell Trading shipment was shown non-compliant by 
Alchem and then given to Saybolt, after which the oil was accepted by PREPA); ¶ 110 (on October 22, 2010, Inspectorate said 
oil was compliant when it was not); ¶¶ 182-87 (after Inspectorate was decertified in 2007, PREPA continued to accept shipments 
of Non-Compliant Fuel Oil that it had falsely certified as compliant)."
1176,34," See, e.g., Compl. ¶ 104 (PREPA would take work away from Alchem if it repeatedly said shipments were Non-Compliant); ¶ 
112 [*52]  (in October 2010 PREPA accepted a shipment certified by Inspectorate despite a contrary finding by Alchem and a 
finding by PREPA's audit team that Inspectorate's results were invalid); ¶ 123 (similar). Regarding Clark, see, e.g., id. ¶ 92 
(Clark was in charge of fuel procurement for PREPA); ¶ 170 (Clark called an Alchem representative into his office when Alchem 
repeatedly failed to certify a shipment). Regarding Rodríguez, see, e.g., id. ¶ 14 (Rodríguez took over Clark's duties when Clark 
retired); id. ¶¶ 199-202 (Rodríguez harangued an employee for failure to participate in the scheme). Regarding Torres, see, e.g., 
id. at 109-12 (Torres participated in the October 2010 acceptance of a Non-Compliant shipment); id. ¶ 136 (Torres tried to halt 
an audit of the Fuel Office, an effort that ultimately succeeded); ¶ 205 (Torres participated in a fake audit of Inspectorate)."
1176,35," The fact that the various participants all knew about the fact of the fraud—the falsified test results—is sufficient to impute to 
each of them specific intent to defraud, which, in any case, may be (and is) generally alleged."
1176,36," The First Circuit has held that ""aiding and abetting the commission of mail fraud"" may constitute a RICO [*53]  predicate. 
Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co. v. P&B Autobody, 43 F.3d 1456, at *12 [published in full-text format at 1994 U.S. App. LEXIS 36770] 
(1st Cir. 1994) (unpublished). Subsequently, it has declined to decide whether that remains the law in light of Central Bank of 
Denver, N.A. v. First Int'l Bank of Denver, N.A., 511 U.S. 164, 114 S. Ct. 1439, 128 L. Ed. 2d 119 (1994). Schultz v. R.I. Hosp. 
Trust Nat. Bank, N.A., 94 F.3d 721, 731 (1st Cir. 1996). But it has also subsequently said that aiding and abetting a state law 
conspiracy did constitute a RICO predicate. United States v. Marino, 277 F.3d 11, 29-31 (1st Cir. 2002). Though not precedential, I must accord Aetna significant persuasive value, especially in light of Marino. But even if I did not, I 
see nothing in Central Bank suggesting that Aetna was wrongly decided. Looking chiefly at the text of the statute, Central Bank 
held that no civil aiding-and-abetting liability existed under § 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act. 511 U.S. at 177-78. The issue 
in Central Bank is thus more analogous to whether civil aiding-and-abetting a RICO violation exists than whether aiding and 
abetting mail fraud may be a predicate act. Moreover, following Central Bank's direction to look at the text, I note that RICO 
defines ""racketeering activity"" to include conduct ""indictable under"" the mail or wire fraud statutes. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1). Aiding 
and abetting mail or wire fraud is indictable under the substantive statute, Aetna, 43 F.3d 1456, at *12 [published in full-text 
format at 1994 U.S. App. LEXIS 36770]; thus, it is a predicate under § 1961(1). See, e.g., Jaguar Cars v. Royal Oaks Motor Car 
Co., 46 F.3d 258, 270 (3d Cir. 1995); Morin v. Trupin, 835 F. Supp. 126, 130 (S.D.N.Y. 1993); Fireman's Fund Ins. Co. v. Plaza 
Oldsmobile Ltd., 600 F. Supp. 1452, 1457 n.2 (E.D.N.Y. 1985). But see Hayden v. Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, 
955 F. Supp. 248, 259 n.10 (S.D.N.Y. 1997). "
1177,37," For these reasons, I am not convinced by the defendants' arguments that Plaintiffs have made impermissible group 
allegations. Plaintiffs have pled significant factual detail, including as to the defendants' specific actions. Yet, the nature of the 
fraud claims prevents them from making specific allegations as to which party was involved in each fraudulent act. They have 
thus resorted to grouping the defendants according to their particular roles in the overall conspiracy. In doing so, they have not 
generally alleged that all of the defendants committed all of the predicate acts. [*55]  Rather, they have been more careful and 
precise in their allegations."
1177,38," Given these findings, I do not believe that the defendants' continuity arguments warrant significant analysis. See generally 
Feinstein v. Resolution Trust Corp., 942 F.2d 34, 45-46 (1st Cir. 1991) (explaining RICO's continuity requirement). Suffice it to 
say that the existence of thousands of fraudulent transactions over a period lasting more than a decade satisfies the statute. "
1178,39," Compare Compl. ¶ 19 (Petrobras supplied PREPA $2 billion in fuel); ¶ 25 (Shell Trading supplied PREPA with $3 billion in 
fuel); ¶ 28 (PetroWest provided at least $3.7 billion in fuel to PREPA); ¶ 35 (Vitol paid provided at least $3.3 billion in fuel to 
PREPA), with id. ¶¶ 26-27 (failing to allege any relationship between Trafigura and PREPA); see also id. ¶ 37 (alleging that 
Méndez helped Petrobras and Vitol ensure that their Non-Compliant oil passed tests and was accepted by PREPA). "
1179,40," Though the First Circuit has not addressed the question, I am operating under the assumption, with which the parties seem to 
agree, that the doctrine also applies when an entity files its rate with a state regulatory commission. See, e.g., Firstcom, Inc. v. 
Qwest Corp., 555 F.3d 669, 679-80 (7th Cir. 2009)."
1179,41," It seems that relatively few courts have analyzed whether the filed-rate defense is an affirmative defense, though I have found 
numerous cases referring to it that way. In any case, there appears to be a consensus that it is a merits defense rather than, for 
example, a jurisdictional one. See Wilson v. EverBank, N.A., 77 F. Supp. 3d 1202, 1233 n.6 (S.D. Fla. 2015) (collecting cases). 
But see In re Hawaiian & Guamanian Cabotage Antitrust Litig., 647 F. Supp. 2d 1250, 1266-66 (W.D. Wash. 2009) (dismissing 
case on basis of the filed-rate defense where [*64]  plaintiffs had not pled its inapplicability, but where the plaintiffs' complaint 
acknowledged that the industry at issue was regulated by tariffs)."
1179,42," The Energy and Transformation Relief Act, Law No. 57 of May 22, 2014, established an independent regulatory agency with 
power over PREPA's rates. It is not clear whether PREPA has actually filed rates with that agency yet, and certainly the 
Complaint does not state that it has. "
1181,43," I also GRANT the motions at Docket Nos. 168, 209, and 211; and DENY the motions at Docket Nos. 185 and 193. "
1189,1," HN1[
] The Court assumes as true all well-pleaded allegations set forth in the complaint. See Killingsworth v. HSBC Bank Nevada, N.A., 507 F.3d 614, 618 (7th Cir. 2007). "
1190,2," Plaintiff argues in its motion for reconsideration that the Court misunderstood the nature of the relevant market because it 
ignored the alleged existence of the two distributional channels. That is incorrect. However, in the interest of clarity and 
completeness, the Court again outlines the two channels in this Opinion and Order. "
1192,3," More specifically, it allegedly provided four reasons for finding Plaintiff's proposal nonresponsive. First, Amtrak stated that the 
resumes of Plaintiff's key personnel were too brief. Yet, according to Plaintiff, Amtrak had never asked for more detailed 
resumes; moreover, it had worked closely with Plaintiff's principals for almost a decade. Id. Second, Amtrak stated that Plaintiff 
would have to train people to work with Amtrak. Plaintiff contends that this was mere pretext because it had worked successfully 
with Amtrak for years, received better feedback than Yankee, and hired ten new employees. Id. ¶ 87. Third, Amtrak stated that 
VBR did not provide a detailed list of the hotels it offered. According to Plaintiff, however, those hotels were listed on its website, 
and Yankee and Plaintiff [*12]  use the same hotel consolidators. Id. ¶ 88. Fourth, Amtrak argued that Plaintiff had never 
operated a third-party brand. Plaintiff counters that, in fact, ""VBR had created two railway leisure brands without any preferential 
treatment and was growing sales at amazing rates, thusly (sic) expanding the promotion of Amtrak by magnitudes. In addition, 
when Amtrak rolled out its new on-line booking system, it was VBR, not Yankee, that helped Amtrak de-bug it."" Id. ¶ 89."
1192,4," Count II includes what is likely a typo in that it alleges ""Violation of § 2 of the Sherman Act (15 U.S.C. § 1)."" Compl. [1] at 29. 
Because it involves monopolization, the Court construes it as a § 2 claim. "

1196,6," In exchange for the 19% commission, Yankee agreed, for example, to ""design, develop, implement, operate and administer all

partners (such as AAA, Vacation.com, and Avoya) to enhance the sale of the Amtrak Vacations brand""; provide Amtrak with 
specified reports; and purchase insurance in compliance with the contract. Compl. Ex. A [1-1] at 4-26. "
1197,7," Case law does not make clear whether a procompetitive business reason is a pleading requirement or an affirmative defense 
that a Plaintiff need not anticipate in its complaint. See United States v. N. Trust Co., 372 F.3d 886, 888 (7th Cir. 2004) 
(""Resolving defenses comes after the complaint stage.""). Here, the difference is immaterial because Plaintiff itself supplied the 
procompetitive business reasons without effectively countering them. "
1198,8," An exception to this general principle exists where a price-regulated monopolist projects its monopoly into another market to 
capture more surplus. See Olympia Equip., 797 F.2d at 374; Fishman v. Estate of Wirtz, 807 F.2d 520, 571 (7th Cir. 1986) 
(Easterbrook, J., dissenting). This exception is not at issue here. "
1199,9," See, e.g., Aspen Skiing, 472 U.S. 585, 105 S. Ct. 2847, 86 L. Ed. 2d 467 (arguably an essential facilities case in which the 
facility was a mountain); Otter Tail Power Co. v. United States, 410 U.S. 366, 93 S. Ct. 1022, 35 L. Ed. 2d 359 (1973) (arguably 
an essential facilities case in which the facility was a power facility); Associated Press v. United States, 326 U.S. 1, 65 S. Ct. 
1416, 89 L. Ed. 2013 (1945) (arguably an essential facilities case where the facility was membership in the Associated Press); 
Terminal R. R. Ass'n of St. Louis, 224 U.S. 383, (arguably an essential facilities case where the facility was a railroad terminal); 
MCI, 708 F.2d at 1133 (defining the essential facility as the ""interconnections for FX and CCSA service""); Fishman v. Estate of 
Wirtz, 807 F.2d 520 (7th Cir. 1986) (identifying the facility as a sports arena)."
1199,10," Fishman involved Chicago Basketball's attempt to sell the Chicago Bulls to the plaintiffs. The sale was contingent on NBA 
approval, which required the plaintiffs to obtain a lease from a stadium. The stadium owner, who was a member of a competing 
bidder, thwarted the [*36]  sale by offering terms so unreasonable that he effectively refused to grant them a lease. More 
specifically, he offered to give Chicago Basketball a ten-year lease that would be assignable only if Chicago Basketball agreed 
to an onerous guarantee, including rent payments, for the entire ten-year term. The Seventh Circuit found these terms 
tantamount to a refusal to lease because (1) they dealt with the owner of the Bulls, not the plaintiff; (2) he promised but failed to 
follow up on his offer, indicating intent not to lease; (3) there was good reason to believe that Chicago Basketball would reject 
the offer; and (4) the evidence sufficiently supported the conclusion that the owner agreed to withhold the stadium from the 
plaintiffs and give his own group a lease instead. See id. at 540-41."
1199,11," See Ideal Dairy Farms, Inc. v. John Labatt, Ltd., 90 F.3d 737, 748 (3d Cir. 1996) (finding no essential facility violation where 
the defendant continued servicing the plaintiff but charged it significantly more than market price); Laurel Sand & Gravel, Inc. v. 
CSX Transp., Inc., 924 F.2d 539, 545 (4th Cir. 1991) (finding no essential facility violation where a defendant railroad offered to 
ship the plaintiff's sand and gravel but would not grant trackage rights allowing the plaintiff to ship them on its own); Valet 
Apartment Servs., Inc. v. Atlanta Journal & Constitution, 865 F. Supp. 828, 833 (N.D. Ga. 1994) (finding no essential facility 
claim where a defendant newspaper permitted plaintiff to purchase certain types of advertisements but not others). "
1200,12," Plaintiff did not present this argument in its complaint or in response to Defendants' motions to dismiss, instead arguing it for 
the first time in this motion to reconsider. In the interests of efficiently managing the litigation moving forward, however, the Court 
explains why this theory also is implausible based on Plaintiff's factual allegations."
1200,13," For example, exclusive dealing may enhance allocative efficiency: if ""exclusive dealing leads dealers to promote each 
manufacturer's brand more vigorously than would be the case under nonexclusive dealing, the quality-adjusted price to the 
consumer (where quality includes the information and other services that [*40]  dealers render to their customers) may be lower 
with exclusive dealing than without[.]"" Roland Machinery Co., 749 F.2d at 395. Exclusive distributorships also may address 
adverse selection or moral hazard concerns inhibiting productive deals: ""A dealer who expresses his willingness to carry only 
one manufacturer's brand of a particular product indicates his commitment to pushing that brand; he doesn't have divided 
loyalties. If the dealer carries several brands, his stake in the success of each is reduced."" Id. Exclusive dealing also can 
""prevent dealers from taking a free ride on [the seller's] efforts (for example, efforts in the form of national advertising) to promote 
his brand."" Id. "
1201,14," LePage is also distinguishable in that it involved bundled rebates and all-or-nothing discounts analogous to product tying. Id. 
at 154-59."
1201,15," Plaintiff's allegation regarding the distribution of monopoly surplus is implausible itself in that it suggests that Amtrak gave 
away all of its monopoly surplus in exchange for nothing. Id. ¶¶ 122, 146. (""Amtrak is not advancing its own interests, but instead 
only advancing Yankee's interests; to wit—the elimination of all of Yankee's competition.""). "
1203,16," The Court accepts for purposes of this opinion Plaintiff's assertion, see [47], at 12, that the Robinson—Patman Act is 
inapplicable to the allegations of Plaintiff's complaint. "
1206,1," Certain of Wickenkamp's allegations suggest that she may have intended, in addition, to allege one or more claims against a 
person identified as Jeff Edison, but she has not done so. "
1208,2," Except where otherwise indicated, the following recitation constitutes my construal of the allegations of plaintiff Wickenkamp's 
complaint, of any matters ncorporated by reference therein, and of any matters properly subject to judicial notice in the light most 
favorable to Wickenkamp. "
1211,3," There is no indication in the docket or elsewhere in the record that any defendant or intended defendant other than AC3, FATIC 
or FATC, and possibly Marilyn Suarez has properly been served with process herein. "
1218,4," As noted above, Wickenkamp's eighth enumerated claim is not a cause of action."
1218,5," Moreover, on June 25, 2009, Judith filed a lawsuit in the Wallowa County Circuit Court against AC3 and FATC. By and through 
her complaint in that action, Judith alleged FATC and AC3's liability for negligent breach of contract, [*49]  breach of the implied 
covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and fraud in connection with the Hubbard/Trackwell transaction, the exchange-facilitator 
contract, the title-insurance contract, and the escrow-closing agreement. Judith specifically alleged the defect in the title to the 
Imnaha River ranch, the undisclosed Riker conflict of interest, FATC's and AC3's actual knowledge at all material times that the 
sellers' representation that the property contained no dumps was false when made, and FATC's and AC3's breach of the title-
insurance contract by failing to make payment in response to Judith's demand of December 2008. "
1219,6," It appears likely that, because she did not serve any defendant with process within 120 days of filing her complaint in this 
action, Wickenkamp cannot rely on the date she initiated these proceedings to determine the timeliness of her claims, but rather 
must rely on the date of service of each defendant to determine whether her claims were timely brought as to each. See Torre v. 
Brickey, 278 F.3d 917, 919-920 (9th Cir. 2002). In consequence, to be timely brought against the AC3 defendants (assuming 
that service on AC3 was sufficient to accomplish service on Marilyn), these claims would need to have accrued not earlier [*51]  
than March 11, 2013, the date two years before the date AC3 was served, and to be timely brought against FATC, these claims 
would need to have accrued not earlier than February 12, 2013, the date two years before the date FATC was reportedly served."
1219,7," As noted above, it appears likely that Wickenkamp must rely on date of service to determine the timeliness of her claims, rather 
than on the date this action was filed. See Torre, 278 F.3d at 919-920. In consequence, to be timely brought against the AC3 
defendants, these claims would need to have accrued not earlier than March 11, 2009, and to be timely brought against FATC, 
these claims would need to have accrued not earlier than February 12, 2009. "
1220,8," As noted above, it appears likely that Wickenkamp must rely on date of service to determine the timeliness of her claims, rather 
than on the date this action was filed. See Torre, 278 F.3d at 919-920. In consequence, to be timely brought against the AC3 
defendants, these claims would need to have accrued not earlier than March 11, 2014, and to be timely brought against FATC, 
these claims would need to have accrued not earlier than February 12, 2014."
1220,9," As noted above, it appears likely that Wickenkamp must rely on date of service to determine the timeliness of her claims, rather 
than on the date this action was filed. See Torre, 278 F.3d at 919-920. In consequence, to be timely brought against the AC3 
defendants, these claims would need to have accrued not earlier than March 11, 2011, and to be timely brought against FATC, 
these claims would need to have accrued not earlier than February 12, 2011. "

1228,3," Arguments made by Gilead in support of its motion to dismiss are joined by Express Scripts and Accredo. (Doc. No. 63 at 2 
n.1.) "
1229,4, The Court does not reach Defendants' alternative arguments in support of their motions to dismiss. [*16]
1229,5," The Court takes judicial notice of this document. See Axcan Scandipharm Inc. v. Ethex Corp., 585 F. Supp. 2d 1067, 1072 n.6 
(D. Minn. 2007) (citing Great Plains Trust Co. v. Union Pac. R.R. Co., 492 F.3d 986, 995-96 (8th Cir. 2007) (taking judicial notice 
of court documents in other cases and an FDA webpage). In addition, in a post-hearing letter, counsel for Gilead informed the 
Court that another generic manufacturer had filed an ANDA with the FDA for a generic version of Letairis. (Doc. No. 93.) "
1241,1," Plaintiffs' other expert, Dr. Leitzinger, is not at issue here. His report does not provide any independent basis for finding 
causation or price impact. For those propositions, he relies on Professor Elhauge's analysis. "
1243,2," As Defendant colorfully explains, the Court should strike ""junk science."" When asked directly, however, Mr. Kaplan repeatedly 
avoided characterizing Professor Elhauge's opinion as junk science. See, e.g., Tr. 486:19-25; 507:16-17. "
1244,3," One market definition of Professor Elhauge was excluded in a case currently on appeal. It's My Party, Inc. v. Live Nat., Inc., 88 
F. Supp. 3d 475 (D. Md. 2015). His market definitions here are undisputed. "
1246,4," Some vaccines are sold premixed and some are sold as powders requiring mixing with a diluent before applying. 
Reconstitution refers to the process of combining the vaccine powder and the liquid diluent to prepare the vaccine for injection. "
1247,5," This is not perfect proof because customers who like the Sanofi brand could conceivably be more likely to be Sanofi-loyal (i.e. 
subject to the bundle). But perfect proof is not needed for an opinion to be reliable."
1247,6," Professor Elhauge disputes Mr. Kaplan's claim that a 4.1% market share shift is minor because Novartis only had 6.6% market 
share under [**26]  the bundle. "
1248,7, See supra at heading II(B)(2)(a)(ii). 
1251,8," Defendant also argues Sanofi and Novartis avoided a price war in the real world, but this argument can be summarily rejected. 
The real world was allegedly infected with anticompetitive conduct that allowed them to avoid competition. That is the whole 
point of Plaintiffs' case. "
1252,9," Though Mr. Kaplan does present some documentary evidence that the parties coordinated, other documents and data 
disagree. "
1253,10," VFC purchases are excluded from the proposed class, but the market is still influenced by them, so the Court considers the 
effect the VFC floor may have on the but-for world."
1253,11," Mr. Kaplan and Sanofi do not make this argument quite so cleanly, as a class could likely still be certified on this theory for a 
slightly lower total figure. See Elh. Rpt. ¶ 185. Even if Novartis and Sanofi's competition priced down to the VFC floor and then 
ceased price competition in the but-for world, prices would be substantially lower."
1253,12," Defendant also challenges Elhauge's methodology for determining fixed and marginal costs-- if it increased between 2010 and 
2012, it was marginal; if not, it was fixed. "
1254,13," This also goes to whether Sanofi and Novartis could match prices. Here, Elhauge's opinion has not been shown to be 
unreliable because fewer than one sale of every thousand was subject to a price-matching management exception. "
1256,14," Class Counsel here is adequate. They have extensive experience with antitrust class actions and have devoted significant 
time to this case. "
1259,15," Foreclosure of the purchasers themselves from purchasing the competing vaccine is not an element of proof here. The alleged 
injury is overcharge resulting from [**61]  a market which was made non-competitive by Sanofi's bundling."
1259,16," There remains a dispute as to whether Sanofi and Novartis would compete or coordinate. Professor Elhauge says they cannot 
coordinate. Mr. Kaplan says they can and would. But both have presented classwide evidence for their positions, so this factual "
1260,," dispute is not relevant to the class certification inquiry. Cf. Amgen Inc. v. Connecticut Retirement Plans & Trust Funds, 568 U.S.

1267,1," The Dreadnought was a British battleship that featured large, long-range guns. The term came to refer to a class of super 
battleship. In drawing this comparison, Mr. Richmond showed himself to be a historian ahead of his time. See generally Robert 
K. Massie, Dreadnought: Britain, Germany, and the Coming of the Great War (1991) (explaining how the naval arms race 
between Britain and Germany contributed to the outbreak of World War I)."
1267,2," The rise of the NCAA roughly paralleled [**11]  that of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the Amateur Athletic 
Union (AAU), both in time and in philosophy. Like the NCAA, both organizations have had to adapt to increasing 
professionalization and commercialization in sports. In the late twentieth century, the IOC abandoned its amateurism 
experiment. The AAU, meanwhile, continues to operate as a sponsor of amateur sports programs and tournaments; it is "
1268,," currently best known for its many boys' basketball teams, which have struggled to deal with the influence of professional agents 
and outside money. See, e.g., Jason Zengerle, Breaks of the Game, N.Y. Times, Dec. 26, 2010, at BR8 (calling it ""a 
commonplace for sportswriters to describe A.A.U. basketball as a cesspool of corruption"")."
1268,3," The ""cost of attendance"" at a particular school includes the items that make up a grant in aid plus ""[nonrequired] books and 
supplies, transportation, and other expenses related to attendance at the institution."" The difference between a grant in aid and 
the cost [**13]  of attendance is a few thousand dollars at most schools. "
1269,4," As this class definition indicates, O'Bannon and Keller limited their suits only to high-level (Division I/FBS) college football and 
men's basketball players. They likely did so in part because almost all of EA's college sports video games have been football 
and men's basketball games, and in part because those two sports generate far more revenue than any other college sports. 
See, e.g., Richard Sandomir & Pete Thamel, Tournament Stays at CBS, Adding Cable and 3 Teams, N.Y. Times, Apr. 23, 2010, 
at B9 (describing CBS's agreement to pay $10.8 billion for the TV rights to the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament for 
a period of 13 years); Marc Tracy & Tim Rohan, What Made College Football More Like the Pros? $7.3 Billion, [**17]  for a Start,

Athletics Programs Report, at 37 (2014), available at https://www.ncaapublications.com/p-4344-division-i-revenues-and-

court's analysis and our own focus on football and men's basketball. "
1270,5," The NFL has never allowed high school players to enter its draft. The NBA did at one time, and a number of NBA stars 
(including LeBron James and Kobe Bryant) came to the league directly from high school, but in 2005, the NBA adopted a rule 
requiring draftees to be at least nineteen years old and one year out of high school, a rule it has retained to the present day. See 
Howard Beck, N.B.A. Draft Will Close Book on High School Stars, N.Y. Times, June 28, 2005, at D1."
1270,6," Although the plaintiffs presented some evidence of other licensing opportunities for merchandise such as jerseys and 
bobbleheads, they abandoned these claims and the district court did not consider such markets further. O'Bannon, 7 F. Supp. 3d 
at 968 n.4."
1270,7," The court acknowledged that the NCAA had recently terminated its relationship with EA by declining to renew its license for 
such video games, but the court found that there was no evidence that the NCAA would not renew the relationship in the future. 
O'Bannon, 7 F. Supp. 3d at 970. "
1273,8," The district court rejected a third proposal: permitting student-athletes to receive compensation from school-approved 
endorsements. O'Bannon, 7 F. Supp. 3d at 984. The court found that this proposal would undermine the NCAA's efforts to 
protect its student-athletes from commercial exploitation. Id. "
1275,9," Importantly, the Court was quite [**38]  clear that the preservation of amateurism, standing alone, was not the justification for 
its decision to reject a per se analysis. Bd. of Regents, 468 U.S. at 100-01 (""This decision [not to apply a per se rule] is not 
based on . . . our respect for the NCAA's historic role in the preservation and encouragement of intercollegiate amateur 
athletics."")."
1275,10," The NCAA appears at some places in its briefs to concede that the amateurism rules are subject to Rule of Reason analysis 
and merely to argue that Board of Regents ""dictates the outcome"" of that analysis. But we see no distinction between that 
position and an argument for blanket antitrust immunity. "
1278,11," The NCAA also asserts before us that it has no intent to license its intellectual property for use in video games in the future, 
but we place no weight on that assertion. Statements in appellate briefs are not evidence. See, e.g., Kyocera Corp. v. 
Prudential-Bache Trade Servs., Inc., 341 F.3d 987, 1002 (9th Cir. 2003)."
1278,12," Even if the district court had not made this factual finding, we would be reluctant to conclude that the NCAA's current 
moratorium on college sports video games precludes the plaintiffs' suit. When a defendant has voluntarily ceased ""allegedly 
improper behavior in response to a suit, but is free to return to it at any time,"" a challenge to the defendant's behavior is 
generally not considered moot unless ""there is no reasonable expectation that the illegal action will recur."" Native Vill. of Noatak 
v. Blatchford, 38 F.3d 1505, 1510 (9th Cir. 1994). Under this logic, the NCAA's decision to terminate its relationship with video 
game companies should not moot the plaintiffs' video game-related claims or show that the NCAA's conduct does not injure the 
plaintiffs. "
1279,13," The NCAA also argues that the First Amendment would preclude any right-of-publicity claim arising out of a sports video 
game. We rejected that argument in Keller, 724 F.3d at 1284, and we will not consider it further in this appeal. Accord Hart v. 
Electronic Arts, Inc., 717 F.3d 141, 170 (3d Cir. 2013) (holding that ""the NCAA Football . . . games at issue in this case do not 
sufficiently transform [student-athletes'] identit[ies] to escape [a] right of publicity claim""). "
1281,14," As we have explained, the district court alternatively characterized student-athletes as buyers of educational services from a 
cartel rather than sellers of labor to a monopsony. This different way of describing the college education market did not alter 
either the district court's analysis of how the market functioned or its assessment that student-athletes are harmed by the 
NCAA's compensation rules. O'Bannon, 7 F. Supp. 3d at 973, 991-93."
1281,15," Indeed, [**62]  the Catalano defendants declined to ""suggest a procompetitive justification for [their] horizontal agreement to 
fix credit."" Catalano, 446 U.S. at 646 n.8. "
1282,16," It may be that what the NCAA means by this argument is that its compensation rules make it possible for schools to fund more 
scholarships than they otherwise could and thereby increase the number of opportunities that recruits have to play college 
sports. To the extent the NCAA is making that argument, it is the functional equivalent of the NCAA's argument that the rules 
increase output in the college education market. The district court found that argument unproved, and we have affirmed that 
finding. "
1283,17," The dissent suggests that during the second step the district court defined the procompetitive benefits as ""limits on large 
amounts of student-athlete compensation preserve the popularity of the NCAA's product."" Dissent at 69, 70. But this cannot be 
right. During the second step, the district court could only consider the benefits of the NCAA's existing [**67]  rule prohibiting NIL 
payments—it could not consider the potential benefits of an alternative rule (such as capping large payments). The correct 
inquiry under the Rule of Reason is: What procompetitive benefits are served by the NCAA's existing rule banning NIL 
payments? The district court found that the NCAA's existing ban provides the procompetitive benefit of preserving amateurism, 
and thus consumer demand. It is only in the third step, where the burden is on the plaintiffs, when the court could consider 
whether alternative rules provide a procompetitive benefit. And even then, the courts' analysis is cabined to considering whether 
the alternative serves the same procompetitive interests identified in second step."
1283,18," Although the NCAA now permits schools and conferences to elect to raise their scholarship caps to the full cost of attendance, 
it could reverse its position on that issue at any time. The district court's injunction prohibiting the NCAA from setting a cap any 
lower than the cost of attendance thus remains in effect, which means that the NCAA's [**70]  challenge to that portion of the 
injunction is not moot. "
1285,19," Although our analysis focuses on whether the alternative serves procompetitive purposes, our prior cases make clear that 
plaintiffs must prove that any alternative will not significantly increase costs to implement. Cnty. of Tuolumne, 236 F.3d at 1159. 
And the district court here failed to make any findings about whether allowing schools to pay students NIL cash compensation 
will significantly increase costs to the NCAA and its member schools."
1285,20," The dissent suggests that the district court found [**75]  amateurism itself has no procompetitive value, and that ""[a]mateurism 
is relevant only insofar as popular demand for college sports is increased by consumer perceptions of and desire for 
amateurism."" Dissent at 70. But this ignores that the district court found that the NCAA's ""current understanding of amateurism"" 
helps ""preserv[e] the popularity of the NCAA's product."" Amateurism is not divorced from the procompetitive benefit identified by 
the court; it is its core element. Elsewhere the dissent argues that ""we are not tasked with deciding what makes an amateur an amateur,"" Dissent at 72 n.5, and 
that ""the distinction between amateur and professional sports is not for the court to delineate. It is a line for consumers to draw,"" 
id. at 71 n.4. However, if we do not have some shared conception of what makes an amateur an amateur—or, more precisely, 
the difference between amateurs and professionals—then the district court's findings on the role of amateurism in college sports 
make no sense. We may not agree on all the particulars, but the basic difference was spelled out by Neal Pilson, a witness the 
district court relied on when determining that small cash payments to students was a viable alternative: ""if you're paid for 
performance, you're not [**76]  an amateur."" "
1286,21," The district court also considered evidence that Division I tennis recruits are permitted to earn up to ten thousand dollars per 
year in prize money from athletic events before they enroll in college. O'Bannon, 7 F. Supp. 3d at 974, 1000. Allowing college-
bound tennis players to accept award money from outside athletic events implicates amateurism differently than allowing 
schools to pay student-tennis players directly."
1286,22," Later in his cross-examination, Pilson was asked if ""the public watches college sports because they perceive student athletes 
as playing [**80]  for the love of the game and for the value and opportunities available to them from a college education?"" 
Pilson responded that that was ""one of the reasons that . . . would be jeopardized."" He then commented that ""the public has . . . 
a sense of college sports that is different from professional [sports] and it's at the bedrock of the popularity of college sports."""
1286,23," The dissent contends that the record supports the finding that $5,000 payments to student-athletes will have little to no effect 
on consumer demand for college football. Dissent at 68 n.3, 72 (suggesting the district court found ""the distinction between 
offering student-athletes no compensation and offering them a small amount of compensation is so minor that it most likely will 
not impact consumer demand in any meaningful way""). But there is little evidence in the record about the impact of these $5,000 
NIL payments. There is evidence only that small payments will be less harmful than larger payments, and that a single witness 
would not be as troubled by $5,000 payments. This is not enough for plaintiffs to meet their burden to show that payments to 
student-athletes will be as effective in preserving consumer demand as the NCAA's current amateurism policy. "
1287,24," The district court suggested that compensating athletes beyond the full cost of attendance would not be problematic because 
student-athletes are already permitted to accept Pell grants that raise their total aid package above the [**83]  cost of 
attendance. O'Bannon, 7 F. Supp. 3d at 1000; Dissent at 65. This reasoning was faulty because it improperly equates 
compensation intended for education-related expenses (i.e., Pell grants) with pure cash compensation. The fact that Pell grants 
(which are available to athletes and nonathletes alike) have not eroded the NCAA's culture of amateurism says little about 
whether cash payments into trust funds to compensate student-athletes for their prowess on the gridiron or the court would do 
so."
1287,25," The dissent criticizes us for citing ""no record evidence to support [our] conclusion that paying student-athletes $5,000 in 
deferred compensation will significantly reduce consumer demand."" Dissent at 68 n.3. But we do not decide, and the NCAA 
need not prove, whether paying student athletes $5,000 payments will necessarily reduce consumer demand. The proper inquiry 
in the Rule of Reason's third step is whether the plaintiffs have shown these payments will not reduce consumer demand 
(relative to the existing rules). And we conclude they have not. "
1288,1," The majority concludes that the plaintiffs established antitrust injury in fact because the NCAA has foreclosed them from the 
market for the athletes' names, images, and likenesses (""NILs"") in video games. Because we are bound by Keller v. Elec. Arts 
Inc. (In re NCAA Student-Athlete Name & Likeness Licensing Litig.), 724 F.3d 1268 (9th Cir. 2013), a case in which I dissented, I 
agree that the plaintiffs have sufficiently established antitrust injury. However, absent Keller, there is a serious question as to 
whether the plaintiffs have established the requisite antitrust injury in fact."
1288,2," Pilson's testimony included the following exchanges: Q: Okay. And let me just turn finally to your last opinion just briefly, Mr. Pilson, regarding whether paying basketball and 
football players in college threatens the popularity of college sports with the television audience. Just briefly sir, over the 
course of your career in the sports broadcast industry, have you come to have opinions about why viewers are interested in 
college sports on television? A: Yes, I have. Q: And how did you come to have those opinions? A: I [sic] been in the industry for 40 years. I've acquired and telecast thousands [**88]  of hours of college sports. I watch 
college sports and evaluate them, so I have a pretty good handle on the industry. Of course, I have personal opinions as 
well, but I certainly—I've worked in the industry a long time."
1288,*," * * * Q: Okay. Now, your opinions about why this would be damaging to the sport are based on your—what you think viewers 
appreciate, what the public perceives. I have that correct? A: Yes. And I would suggest I've been in that business measuring viewers—my whole job at CBS over 20 years was to try 
to figure out what the viewers wanted to watch and give it to them, so I'm not a layman on that subject. "
1289,3," The majority states that it ""cannot agree that a rule permitting schools to pay students pure cash compensation and a rule 
forbidding them from paying NIL compensation are both equally effective in promoting amateurism and preserving consumer 
demand."" Op. at 56-57. And yet the majority cites no record evidence to support [**90]  its conclusion that paying student-
athletes $5,000 in deferred compensation will significantly reduce consumer demand. Rather, the majority declares that it is a 
""self-evident fact"" that ""[t]he difference between offering student-athletes education-related compensation and offering them 
cash sums untethered to educational expenses is not minor; it is a quantum leap."" Op. at 58, 61. To the contrary, the district 
court concluded after a full bench trial that the distinction between offering student-athletes no compensation and offering them a 
small amount of compensation is so minor that it most likely will not impact consumer demand in any meaningful way. See 
O'Bannon, 7 F. Supp. 3d at 976-77, 983-84, 1000-01. "
1290,4," The majority argues that ""[h]aving found amateurism is integral to the NCAA's market, the district court cannot plausibly 
conclude that being a poorly-paid professional athlete is 'virtually as effective' for that market as being an amateur. Or, to borrow 
the Supreme Court's analogy, the market for college football is distinct from other sports markets and must be 'differentiate[d]' 
from professional [**94]  sports lest it become 'minor league [football].'"" Op. at 58. The district court found that amateurism 
played a limited role in preserving the popularity of college sports, and that other factors, such as school loyalty, served as the 
primary force driving interest in college athletics. O'Bannon, 7 F. Supp. 3d at 1000. But I agree that an antitrust court should not 
eliminate the distinction between professional and college sports; to do so would undermine competition. However, in terms of 
antitrust analysis, the distinction between amateur and professional sports is not for the court to delineate. It is a line for 
consumers to draw. If consumers believe that paying college football players $5,000 to be held in trust for use of their NILs will 
convert college football into professional football, and as a consequence they stop watching college football, then the proposed 
alternative will not be virtually as effective as the current rule. But, taken to its literal extreme to prohibit even small, deferred 
payments, the idea that ""if you're paid for performance, you're not an amateur,"" Op. at 57 n.20, does not reflect consumer 
behavior. The district court made factual findings that modest payments, including those held [**95]  in trust, would not 
significantly affect consumer demand. See O'Bannon, 7 F. Supp. 3d at 976-77, 983-84, 1000-01. Therefore, I cannot conclude 
that the district court clearly erred."
1290,5," The majority states that ""in finding that paying students cash compensation would promote amateurism as effectively as not 
paying them, the district court ignored that not paying student-athletes is precisely what makes them amateurs."" Op. [**96]  at 
57. This is not true even under the NCAA's current definition of the term. But more importantly, we are not tasked with deciding "
1291,," what makes an amateur an amateur. We are tasked with determining whether a proposed less-restrictive alternative restraint will 
affect consumer demand. "
1293,1," USS claims Checkpoint entered into agreements restraining trade in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act and Ohio 
Revised Code §§1331 et seq.; unlawfully monopolized and attempted to monopolize relevant markets in violation of Section 2 of 
the Sherman Act; and unreasonably restrained trade in violation of Section 3 of the Clayton Act. See second amended 
complaint, counts I-IV, VI (docket no. 139)."
1293,2," Specifically, the Special Master concludes the Court should grant Checkpoint's motion to bar Shehadeh's opinions regarding 
lost profit damages stemming from sales of towers, deactivators, and related service; and otherwise deny Checkpoint's motion. "
1296,3," Knievel opines that ""RF is superior to AM for the drug and grocery markets because (1) RF tags are available in a wide variety 
of flat designs, which are suitable for small, lightweight packaging of many [health, beauty, and cosmetic] products sold in 
drugstores and grocery stores, and may be custom printed or transparent; (2) RF tags have a greater deactivation range making 
RF tags more easily and efficiently deactivated; and (3) RF technology is generally less costly and more energy efficient."" 
Knievel Report at 15, ¶33."
1296,4," Checkpoint cites Concord Boat Corp. v. Brunswick Corp., 207 F.3d 1039, 1056 (8th Cir. 2000), which found inadmissible an 
antitrust expert's opinions because the economic model the expert used to construct a hypothetical market ""ignored inconvenient 
evidence"" and ""was not grounded in the economic reality of the [relevant] market."" "
1299,5," To calculate Checkpoint's label margins in the F&D market and non-F&D market, Shehadeh simply used the price data 
provided to him by Checkpoint. Checkpoint asserts Shehadeh should have corrected this price data to account for the fact that 
Checkpoint sometimes raised label prices in connection with ""comp tag"" promotions, where F&D customers agreed to pay 
higher label prices in exchange for receiving other EAS products for free. These higher label prices would, of course, appear to 
increase label margins, even though the increase was offset by lower margins on other EAS products. As noted, however, 
Checkpoint's non-F&D customers received similar promotions, so the label margin ""corrections"" would have to occur for both 
markets; further, it is extremely likely Checkpoint would challenge any comp tag ""correction"" Shehadeh made to label prices, in 
any event. Ultimately, Shehadeh used Checkpoint's own data in a methodologically reasonable fashion; [*25]  Checkpoint is free 
to challenge those methods on cross-examination. "
1300,6," If Shehadeh opines at trial that his original conclusion shown in figure 9 is correct (as opposed to his modified conclusion in 
revised figure 9) and a jury concludes he is wrong because he insisted on relying on incorrect data, then USS's case will 
certainly be undermined much worse than would pretrial exclusion of Shehadeh's opinion."
1300,7," To be clear, Shehadeh's original Figure 9 shows Checkpoint's average margin difference for ""all years"" — meaning 2003-2012 
— was 4.48%, and this calculation is statistically significant at the 1% level. In Shehadeh's revised Figure 9, which accounts for 
the purported Lowe's data entry error, Checkpoint's average margin difference for ""all years"" was 1.38%, and this calculation is 
not statistically significant. Shehadeh adds, however, that revised [*31]  Figure 9 also shows Checkpoint's average margin 
difference for 2004-2010 was 1.31%, and this calculation is statistically significant. The overriding point is that statistical 
significance is properly measured internally based on the average margin test Shehadeh actually ran, and not with reference to "
1301,," the SSNIP test. It is also true, however, that a 1.31% average margin difference is fairly minor and is therefore relatively weak 
evidence of market power. Still, the average margin difference for certain single years in revised Figure 9 was much higher (e.g., 
17.25% in 2008 and 12.28% in 2010)."
1301,8," Furthermore, USS explains that Checkpoint's focus is incorrect when it asserts Shehadeh's margin difference calculations are 
insignificant because they are less than 5%: The 4.48% difference observed [in Figure 9] is a difference in actual percentage points, not a relative change. Given 
Checkpoint's margins, a 4.48 point difference in the gross margin actually corresponds to a 9.9% relative difference in price 
(assuming identical costs for both sets of customers), which aligns with Shehadeh's observation that Checkpoint has been 
able to sustain roughly 10% higher prices in the food and drug market. [*32]  Similarly, the 1.38 point difference reported in 
Shehadeh's revised Figure 9 corresponds to a roughly 3% relative difference in price. Docket no. 354 at 12. It is the price differential more than the gross margin that provides evidence of monopoly. See IIB Phillip E. 
Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law ¶516f3 at 144 (3rd ed. 2007) (a monopolist ""may spend up to its full monopoly 
profit in activities designed to achieve or maintain market power""). "
1304,9," Checkpoint insists the prices CVS (for example) would pay absent the bundling discount CVS received would not be 
Checkpoint's catalog [*45]  or list prices; rather, because CVS was such a huge customer, it would still have received a discount 
from list price. Checkpoint notes that other large customers, such as Target (and even some smaller customers) did not pay list 
price, even though they did not receive a bundling discount. Checkpoint concludes, therefore, that Shehadeh's calculation of ""the 
discount given by [Checkpoint] on the entire bundle of products"" was unrealistically high. PeaceHealth, 515 F.3d at 910. As 
such, Checkpoint insists Shehadeh's allocation of this too-high discount ""to [Checkpoint's] competitive product or products,"" and 
his conclusion that Checkpoint ""sold the competitive product or products below its average variable cost of producing them,"" is 
demonstrably incorrect. PeaceHealth, 515 F.3d at 910. Checkpoint's argument asks the Court to find that Shehadeh's use of Checkpoint's own published, catalog and list prices as the 
benchmark for calculating discounts was an unreliable method. The Special Master cannot conclude that comparison of a 
product's actual selling price with its own list price is not a reliable measure of its discount. In other words, Checkpoint's 
complaint about Shehadeh's discount calculation is a matter for cross-examination, not a [*46]  basis for exclusion. The ""real 
amount"" of product discount given by Checkpoint to various retailers for various products must be determined by a finder-of-fact. The question of how the amount of ""discount"" is measured under PeaceHealth will also be addressed in the Special Master's 
forthcoming Report addressing the admissibility of the expert opinions of Checkpoint experts Harris and Keeley. "
1310,10," In TYR Sport, the court determined the expert's opinion was not based on sufficient facts or data only after the defendant 
supplied missing information. Here, despite the opportunity to do so in three briefs, Checkpoint has not identified a single 
significantmarket participant unaccounted for in Shehadeh's analysis, nor provided support for a meaningfully larger sales 
volume for RF-EAS in the F&D market. In short, Checkpoint asks the Court to find the data underlying Shehadeh's market share 
calculations insufficient because, despite Shehadeh's testimony that he considered all the significant players, and despite 
Checkpoint's own documents concurring with Shehadeh's conclusions, there ""may be"" an unidentified market participant that 
would render Shehadeh's conclusions so flawed as to be inadmissible. It cannot be the case that an expert's market share opinion must include an analysis of every single market participant, no matter 
how de minimis. If the evidence showed the RF-EAS market for F&D retailers across the relevant time period is $1 billion and 
not the approximately $210 million Shehadeh included in his analysis [*67]  (see Shehadeh Report fig. 4), then Shehadeh's 
conclusion that Checkpoint's $208 million in sales constitutes nearly a 99% share would not be credible. But that is not the case 
here. Where an experienced economist examines multiple market participants and dismisses others as insignificant, that expert 
should be permitted to offer his opinion. See U.S. Information Systems, 313 F. Supp.2d at 232 (""despite the potential effect the 
small sample size could have on the persuasiveness of [an expert]'s conclusions, his testimony is not inadmissible solely based 
on sample size alone""); A & M Records, Inc. v. Napster Inc., 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20668, 2000 WL 1170106 at *3-4 (N.D. Cal. 
Aug.10, 2000) (error in identifying the entire universe of a target population did not affect admissibility of the expert's testimony). 
Of course, if Checkpoint provides evidence at trial that the market's size or composition is materially different from Shehadeh's 
figures, then cross-examination will undermine his credibility. "
1312,11," During Holm's deposition, he was shown an internal USS document that stated: ""The FCC has approved the systems 
designed and patented by Universal Surveillance Systems to service the loss prevention requirements of the food and drug 
industry."" Depo. at 95 (docket no. 328-3). Holm confirmed his understanding that USS's RF-System components were FCC-
approved. Id. The internal document Holm looked at was an ""executive summary"" sent from USS Senior Vice President Denise 
Canfield to USS President Adel Sayegh on March 16, 2011; Sayegh forwarded it to a potential investor. Id. at 87. As discussed below, Canfield [*74]  has since attested USS's towers were not FCC-approved until 2014. It is unclear why the 
executive summary Sayegh forwarded to a potential investor in March of 2011 stated incorrectly that USS's towers were FCC-
approved. "
1313,12," This table summarizes a ""backup chart"" created by Shehadeh. For reasons that are unclear, the figures in Shehadeh's backup 
chart are slightly different from the figures contained in Figure 19 of Shehadeh's report. These slight differences, however, are 
immaterial."
1313,13," Checkpoint observes that the FCC certified USS's ""Mirage"" tower, while Shehadeh's damage calculations were based on but-
for sales of the ""UNI-MONO8.2"" tower. USS asserts the ""the 'Mirage' incorporated the UNI-MON8.2 technology for purposes of 
FCC certification."" Response at 2 (docket no. 495). At this juncture, the Special Master assumes USS is correct."
1313,14," At the Daubert hearing, Checkpoint referred to an October 22, 2007 email from Callidus to USS, where Callidus writes, ""We 
finally passed FCC here in Czech republic."" Daubert hearing exh. HX070. Perhaps this led USS to believe its towers were FCC-
certified. Still, this belief does not fit with subsequent documents — for example: (1) a much-later email from Callidus to USS 
dated October 10, 2010, describing Callidus's efforts in resolving a ""slight hitch in RF FCC testing,"" Daubert hearing exh. HX064; 
and (2) a January 7, 2012 document showing that an independent lab tested USS's RF tower and found it met FCC regulations, 
see Canfield declaration exh. A (docket no. 484). This latter document is the first that suggests USS received some degree of 
""FCC approval,"" which is still apparently not the same as actual certification. See also Daubert hearing tr. at 104-16 (discussing 
several emails showing that, beginning in 2006, USS repeatedly urged Callidus to procure FCC certification for the RF-towers). "
1314,15," The Special Master observes it was not Shehadeh's fault that his opinions were premised upon incorrect facts. It was USS's 
own executives — including Sayegh, Canfield, Holm, and others — who provided Shehadeh with incorrect information. "
1315,16," See, e.g., Daubert tr. at 78 (""[Checkpoint's] exclusionary conduct doesn't just [mean] you don't make these sales, right, it 
changes your incentives. It changes USS's incentives to engage in a full range of marketing activities, of product development 
activities, . . . . * * * If [USS] had the commercial opportunities that they anticipated based on everything I reviewed, they would 
have pursued the FCC certification earlier.""); USS's post-Daubert hearing brief at 7 (docket no. 483) (""In the absence of 
Checkpoint's conduct, . . . USS would have been incentivized to secure FCC certification sooner because the largest purchasers 
of RF EAS equipment would not have been foreclosed."")."
1315,17," See e.g., Daubert tr. at 79 (""based on the information I reviewed, [USS] would have had the opportunity to pursue [FCC 
certification], and given the relatively short amount of time that it took them to get that, would have achieved it in time to make 
the sales that are included in the — the damages that I've calculated.""); USS's post-Daubert hearing brief at 7 (docket no. 
483) [*84]  (""in the but-for world, USS would have achieved full-scale EAS equipment capability within two years of penetrating 
the Relevant Markets with EAS consumables"")."
1315,18," In its summary judgment briefing, USS argues [*85]  the ""only impact [its failure to get FCC certification] could have . . . is 
regarding the quantum of damage."" Response at 45 (docket no. 352). USS then writes: ""the question one must ask is: in the but-
for world, what impact if any would alleged FCC intervention [against USS] have had on the quantum of damage?"" Id. at. 46 
(emphasis in original). Citing First Beverages, Inc. v. Royal Crown Cola Co., 612 F.2d 1164 (9th Cir. 1980), USS concludes the 
impact would be zero, because Checkpoint has no evidence that the FCC would have (for example) intervened by forbidding 
USS from selling its towers, thereby reducing any lost profit damages. The point, however, is that Checkpoint had no reason or 
opportunity to pursue discovery related to an FCC intervention theory, because USS stated its towers were FCC-approved — 
USS did not say (and Shehadeh did not assume) that it would have knowingly sold towers even without certification. USS cannot 
fault Checkpoint for failing to adduce evidence of the ""impact . . . FCC intervention [would] have . . . on the quantum of damage"" 
in Shehadeh's (or some other) version of the but-for world, when it was USS's own assertions of fact that kept Checkpoint from 
pursuing that evidence."
1315,19," USS argues: (1) its complaint ""makes no mention of FCC certification at all,"" so it has no obligation to amend its pleadings; (2) 
its answers to interrogatories ""are complete and do not require supplementation;"" and (3) Shehadeh timely supplemented his 
report by offering revised FCC certification opinions during his second deposition and his testimony at the Daubert hearing. 
Response [*87]  at 5-6 (docket no. 6). Even assuming the first two arguments are valid, the third is not. "
1316,20," It is interesting to speculate how things might be different if USS had given Shehadeh correct information from the start. ""[I]n 
the antitrust context, plaintiffs enjoy a considerable amount of leeway in 'constructing a hypothetical world free of the 
defendant['s] exclusionary activities'"" for purposes of estimating their damages. Univac Dental Co. v. Dentsply Intern., Inc., No. 
1: 07 CV 493, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 41130, 2010 WL 1816745 at *3 (M.D. Pa. Apr. 27, 2010) (quoting LePage's Inc. v. 3M, 324 
F.3d 141, 166 (3rd Cir. 2003)). This is because ""[d]amages in an antitrust case 'are rarely susceptible to the kind of concrete, 
detailed proof of injury which is available in other contexts.'"" Litton Sys., Inc. v. Am. Tel. & Telegraph Co. 700 F.2d 785, 823 (2nd 
Cir. 1983) (quoting Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 395 U.S. 100, 123, 89 S. Ct. 1562, 23 L. Ed. 2d 129 (1969)). 
It is entirely conceivable that Shehadeh could have offered an admissible ""but-for"" damages opinion that included lost profits 
flowing from tower and deactivator sales, premised on the hypothetical that USS would have obtained FCC certification earlier 
but for Checkpoint's anticompetitive conduct. Because he was given incorrect information, however, Shehadeh never offered this 
hypothetical or explained the evidentiary bases for it; and therefore, Checkpoint never had a chance to investigate or challenge 
any such opinions. [*88] "

1354,1," In the complaint, plaintiffs allege that they are ""entitled to treble damages and to injunctive relief under section 2 of the 
Sherman Act and Section 16 of the Clayton Act,"" but they make no reference to section 4. Section 4 of the Clayton Act is the 
provision of the antitrust laws that grants a statutory right of private action to seek actual and treble damages for antitrust law 
violations, and accordingly it must be the method by which plaintiffs seek to vindicate their alleged rights. "
1365,*," This summary constitutes no part of the opinion of the court. It has been prepared by court staff for the convenience of the

1366,1," POSCO America and POSCO-California Corporation (collectively, ""POSCO"") are subsidiaries of Pohang Iron & Steel Co., Ltd., 
headquartered in South Korea. POSCO has not made tin mill products since 2000 and has never sold tin mill products in the 
United States."
1366,2," The defendants earlier challenged Stanislaus's standing as an indirect purchaser. See Stanislaus Food Prods. Co. v. USS-
POSCO Indus., 782 F. Supp. 2d 1059 (E.D. Cal. 2011). The district court's resolution of that issue in Stanislaus's favor is not 
challenged on appeal. The remaining defendants are UPI, POSCO, Pitcal, Inc., and U.S. Steel. "
1368,3," In light of Matsushita's mandate to probe the plausibility and economic underpinnings of a claim, Stanislaus's argument that the 
district court erred by assessing the rationality of the alleged conspiracy is unpersuasive. HN9[
] The factual context of a claim 
and the economic plausibility of a defendant's motivation to conspire play an explicit, central role in the standards set forth in 
Matsushita. It is an uncontroversial tenet of antitrust law that ""[t]he clarity and intensity of a motivation may bear on the 
inferences to be drawn from ambiguous evidence of coordinated [**12]  behavior."" Phillip E. Areeda (late) & Herbert 
Hovencamp, Antitrust Law ¶ 1412f (4th ed. Supp. 2015). Of course, our review is de novo but we conclude that the district 
court did not violate Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(f)(2) by factoring these concerns into its analysis. Indeed, it was bound to 
do so by Matsushita. "
1369,4," This moniker refers to the fact that a graph tracking the prices would resemble the shape of a hockey stick, with a ""sharp 
upswing at the end"" of the term of the prior contract representing a dramatic price increase. See In re Oracle Corp. Sec. Litig., 
627 F.3d 376, 383-84 (9th Cir. 2010). "
1370,5," Stanislaus also complains that these pricing patterns do not reflect the historical spread between the cost of hot band steel and 
the price of tin mill products, and argues that the patterns are inconsistent with declining demand and excess manufacturing 
capacity. Market conditions during a period of alleged collusion can be a plus factor that support an inference of agreement. 
See, e.g., In re Publ'n Paper Antitrust Litig., 690 F.3d 51, 65 (2d Cir. 2012) (excess capacity). But Stanislaus's arguments on this 
point are spare and devoid of citations to the record. "
1372,6," For example, the expert report does not contain any analysis of profit margins showing that USS would actually be better off 
with 50% of UPI's profits in the western U.S. than it would be competing for its own business in the western U.S. During oral 
argument, when asked whether there was any ""mathematical analysis of the profit margins"" in the record ""that shows [U.S. Steel 
is] actually better off with the 50% [of UPI's profits in the western U.S.] than the 100% [of what] they might get by competing,""

1375,1," The Complaint inadvertently includes two paragraphs numbered ""11."" See Pl.'s Br. 25 n.13. For ease of reference, the Court 
will refer to the first paragraph ""11"" as ""11a"" and the second as ""11b."" "
1376,2," CA, Inc. serves as the only vendor through which Commonwealth and Altadis sell their tobacco products to wholesale and retail 
customers."
1376,3," The CA defendants argued in their motion, as an initial point, that the Counts I, V, and VI should be dismissed against them 
because Plaintiff did not specify which [**10]  particular defendants committed which acts, but instead referred to these 
defendants collectively. See CA's Br. 3-5. However, at oral argument, Defendants noted that there is overlap between the "
1377,," entities in the CA organizational structure. Tr. 4:21-25. Further, Plaintiff agreed, during argument, to voluntarily dismiss 
Commonwealth, a cigarette manufacturer, from the action if discovery reveals Commonwealth was not involved in the conduct at 
issue. Tr. 7:19-8:22. The Court finds that Plaintiff has sufficiently stated claims against the CA defendants at this early stage of 
litigation but will permit these defendants to reassert this argument, if appropriate, once discovery on the corporate organization 
is complete."
1377,4," The ""Causes of Action"" portion of Plaintiff's Complaint also lists Section 2(d) among the provisions of the Robinson-Patman Act 
allegedly violated by both CA and HLA. Compl. ¶¶ 110, 117. Section 2(d) of the Act prohibits sellers from discriminating between 
customers in the provision of services or facilities in connection with the sale of a commodity. 15 U.S.C. § 13(d). Section 2(a) 
addresses discrimination in price. 15 U.S.C. § 13(a); see also 3-27 Federal Antitrust Law § 27.7 (""Section 2(a)... is intended to 
cover differences in the price actually paid by the customers .... A discrimination in services or facilities, on the other hand, is a 
benefit which does not reduce the price to any customer . . . .""). Plaintiff's allegations center on price discrimination and do not 
indicate that Defendants' conduct involved the provision of ""services or facilities."" See, e.g., Compl. ¶ 110 (""CA's acts of price 
discrimination as detailed herein constitute multiple violations of [**13]  the Robinson-Patman Act, including ... 15 U.S.C. §§ 
13(a) and (d)."" (emphasis added)). Plaintiff's opposition briefing likewise focuses on price discrimination and does not address 
any unlawful provision of ""services or facilities"" or Section 2(d) specifically. See Pl.'s Opp. Br. 6 (describing the Robinson-
Patman Act claims as ""garden-variety price discrimination""). In addition, Plaintiff lists a violation of Section 2(a) in Count II, Compl. ¶ 117, but clarifies in its brief that ""HLA's liability under the 
Robinson-Patman Act"" is for ""its knowing receipt or inducement of discriminatory prices."" Pl.'s Opp. Br. 12. The Court, therefore, "
1378,," construes Plaintiff to maintain the following claims at this stage: (1) Section 2(a) claim against the CA defendants (Count I); and 
(2) Section 2(f) claim against HLA (Count II)."
1378,5," Primary-line injury arises from conduct that harms competitors at the level of the discriminating seller, while tertiary-line injury 
refers to harm to competition among the customers of the favored and disfavored purchasers. Volvo, 546 U.S. at 176. "
1379,6," HLA also argues that Plaintiff's discriminatory pricing claims should be limited to the period prior to July 2012 because Plaintiff 
did not actually buy CA's mass market cigars after that month. Tr. 81:3-7. However, Plaintiff alleges that in early September 
2013, Plaintiff placed an order with CA and CA responded with an invoice, which included a delivery date. Compl. ¶ 89. Some 
courts have concluded that where an executory contract exists between a buyer and a seller, the buyer may be considered a 
""purchaser"" for the purposes of Robinson-Patman Act ""even if there was no actual sale."" En-Vogue v. UK Optical Ltd., 843 F. 
Supp. 838, 846 (E.D.N.Y. 1994) (citing Harper Plastics, Inc. v. Amoco Chemicals Corp., 617 F.2d 468, 471 (7th Cir.1980)); see 
also Aluminum Co. of Am. v. Tandet, 235 F. Supp. 111, 114 (D. Conn. 1964). To the extent that there was an executory contract 
between CA and Plaintiff in September 2013, Plaintiff was a disfavored purchaser under the Robinson-Patman Act after July 
2012. HLA may reassert this argument at the summary judgment stage, if warranted by the facts revealed in discovery."
1379,7," Sufficient allegations of this nature give rise to a rebuttable inference of ""competitive injury"" under Section 2(a). Feesers I, 498 
F.3d at 213. "
1380,8," The CA defendants also cursorily reference a similar argument in a footnote, while arguing that Plaintiff has failed to allege the 
""competitive injury"" element of Plaintiff's prima facie case of price discrimination. See CA's Br. (Doc. 22-2) 16 n.10."
1380,9," The Robinson-Patman Act is ""a prophylactic statute which is violated merely upon a showing that the effect of such 
discrimination may be substantially to lessen competition."" J. Truett Payne Co. v. Chrysler Motors Corp., 451 U.S. 557, 561-62, 
101 S. Ct. 1923, 68 L. Ed. 2d 442 (1981) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). It does not provide a private right of 
action for treble damages. Blue Tree Hotels Inv. (Canada), Ltd. v. Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc., 369 F.3d 212, 
218 (2d Cir. 2004). This right is provided by Section 4 of the Clayton Act, which authorizes private suits by ""any person who shall 
be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws."" Id. In order to recover treble 
damages under the Clayton Act, ""a plaintiff must make some showing of actual injury attributable to something the antitrust laws "
1381,," were designed to prevent."" [**24]  Id. at 562. ""It must prove more than a violation of § 2(a), since such proof establishes only that 
injury may result. Id. (emphasis in original)."
1381,10," As discussed above, by alleging an inverse correlation between HLA's market share and Plaintiff's market share for the 
distribution of CA's mass market cigars, Plaintiff's allegations strongly suggest that Plaintiff was HLA's only major competitor in 
the market. Id. ¶¶ 43, 83, 94. "
1382,11," The Supreme Court has held that for purposes of Section 1 claims, certain categories of restraints are deemed per se 
unreasonable ""without inquiry into the particular market context."" Nat'l Collegiate Athletic Ass'n v. Bd. of Regents of Univ. of 
Okla., 468 U .S. 85, 100, 104 S. Ct. 2948, 82 L. Ed. 2d 70(1984). Restraints of trade found to be per se illegal include horizontal 
agreements to fix prices [**28]  or to allocate markets. Leegin, 551 U.S. at 886 (2007). The parties appear to agree that 
Defendants' alleged actions should not be considered per se unreasonable and thus demand an ""an inquiry into market power 
and market structure,"" which requires Plaintiff to allege a product market. Id."
1382,12," Whether a product market can be [**29]  divided into narrow submarkets will depend on factors such as ""industry or public 
recognition of the submarket[s] as [] separate economic entit[ies], the product's peculiar characteristics and uses, [and] . . . 
distinct customers"" and prices, to name a few. Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, 370 U.S. 294, 325, 82 S. Ct. 1502, 8 L. Ed. 2d 
510 (1962) (rejecting the argument that medium-priced shoes are a different submarket from low-priced shoes because the 
public recognizes the relevant lines of commerce as men's, women's and children's shoes). "
1383,13," The Supreme Court explained that ""a tying arrangement is an agreement by a party to sell one product but only on the 
condition that the buyer also purchases a different (or tied) product, or at least agrees that he will not purchase that product from 
any other supplier."" Kodak, 504 U.S. at 461-62 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). "
1384,14," Plaintiff also highlighted at oral argument the necessity of carrying the full line. Tr. 35:8-15; see also id. at 16:19-17:11, 27:8-
16."
1384,15," If CA's brands of cigars could be singled out as a legally cognizable ""submarket,"" a parallel submarket should also exist [**35]  
for distribution of every other manufacturer's brands, given the inability of a distributor to substitute any brand for any other in the 
market alleged. But at oral argument, Plaintiff specifically denied the possibility of submarkets for the distribution of other 
manufacturers' brands, creating further inconsistencies in Plaintiff's allegations. Tr. 72:4-21. "
1391,1," ""[J]urisdictional challenges to an indictment may be raised at any time,"" United States v. Rosa-Ortiz, 348 F.3d 33, 36 (1st Cir. 
2003), but all other motions regarding a defective indictment, such as failure to state an offense, must be made before trial, Fed. 
R. Crim. P. 12(b)(3)(B), and thus can only be reviewed for plain error if raised for the first time on appeal, see United States v. 
Turner, 684 F.3d 244, 255 (1st Cir. 2012). Here, it matters not whether we treat Peake's argument as a jurisdictional challenge, 
or as an untimely-made failure-to-state-a-claim argument to be reviewed for plain error, because, as we explain, Peake was 
correctly charged under Section 1, so there was no error at all."
1391,2," Peake argues that he should instead have been charged under Section 3 of the Sherman Act, which contains the same 
prohibitions, but applies to territories. 15 U.S.C. § 3(a) (""Every . . . conspiracy[] in restraint of trade or commerce . . . between 
any such Territory and another, or between any such Territory or Territories and any State or States . [**7]  . . is declared 
illegal.""). "
1392,3," The full text of the paragraph struck stated: In order to minimize the prospect of the removal and subsequent destruction of any of the documents and records identified 
in Exhibit B to the Search Warrant, the search will include the briefcases, laptop [**11]  computers, hand-held computers, 
cell phones, Blackberries, and other movable document containers found on the premises described above, and in the 
possession of, or readily identifiable as belonging to SEA STAR management, pricing, and sales personnel including, but 
not limited to, FRANK PEAKE, PETER A. BACI, CARL FOX, NED LAGOY, NEIL PERLMUTTER, ALEX CHISHOLM, MIKE 
NICHOLSON, EDWARD PRETRE, and WILLIAM BYRNES. "
1394,4," Alternatively, the magistrate [**16]  judge may have intended to eliminate personal items from the search, and limit the agents 
to seizing company property only. See Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388, 395 
n.7, 91 S. Ct. 1999, 29 L. Ed. 2d 619 (1971) (""[T]he Fourth Amendment confines an officer executing a search warrant strictly 
within the bounds set by the warrant."" (quoting Marron, 275 U.S. at 196)). But Peake does not appear to argue that the 
information from his computer and Blackberry should have been suppressed because they were personal, and not company 
property, so we will not go down this road. "
1396,5," For example, Baci testified that, during part of the conspiracy, Peake pushed for perfectly legal strategies that would negatively 
affect the stability of the ""Florida 50/50"" arrangement -- the name given to the strategy of allocating equal market shares 
between Horizon Lines and Sea Star. One such pro-competition strategy that Peake had advocated for was for a third ship to 
serve the Puerto Rico-Jacksonville route; another was a ""slap strategy"" whereby Sea Star would pursue the business of any 
company [**21]  that tried to steal their clients. In his testimony, Serra confirmed Baci's statement that Peake wanted to add a 
third ship. He also testified that Peake authorized competitive shipping rates and that their meetings were strictly legal. In 
addition, on the stand, Glova could not identify any direct references to Peake in his records of communications made in 
furtherance of the conspiracy."
1396,6," Generally, there is a distinction between direct and indirect consumers in antitrust cases. See Hanover Shoe, Inc. v. United 
Shoe Mach. Corp., 392 U.S. 481, 492-94, 88 S. Ct. 2224, 20 L. Ed. 2d 1231 (1968). The harm to be considered is only that to 
direct consumers. See Ill. Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 752, 97 S. Ct. 2061, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1977) (""Limiting defendants' 
liability to the loss of profits suffered by direct purchasers would thus allow the antitrust offender to avoid having to pay the full 
social cost of his illegal conduct in many cases in which indirect purchasers failed to bring suit."")."
1396,7," Near the end of trial, the court issued a memorandum opinion and order denying Peake's motion for a new trial, finding no 
misconduct on the basis of the prosecutor's opening statement, but, even assuming misconduct, concluding that any prejudice 
was cured by the fact that the remarks were isolated, the jury was given a detailed curative instruction, and the objected-to 
statements did not bear on any elements of the charged offense. "
1397,8," An Allen charge is [**25]  ""[a] supplemental jury instruction given by the court to encourage a deadlocked jury, after prolonged 
deliberations, to reach a verdict."" Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014); see Allen v. United States, 164 U.S. 492, 17 S. Ct. 
154, 41 L. Ed. 528 (1896)."
1397,9," Peake does not appeal the district court's rulings on the other issues raised in the Rule 33 and 29 motions, which challenged 
the district court's denials of: (1) Peake's request to submit hearsay evidence from one of the co-conspirators; (2) Peake's 
objection to the admissibility of financial disclosures; and (3) Peake's request for a new trial on grounds that the government had 
failed to disclose exculpatory evidence in violation of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963)."
1397,10," Peake additionally claims that he was incorrectly prohibited from diminishing the negative effects of those statements because 
the government moved successfully to prohibit him from arguing that -- despite the antitrust conspiracy -- shipping costs 
remained reasonable and fair. But whether the agreed-upon prices charged by the conspirators were nonetheless fair or 
reasonable does not affect our conclusion. A per se Section 1 violation is not excused by a showing that the supra-competitive 
prices were somehow still reasonable. United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. 150, 212-13, 60 S. Ct. 811, 84 L. Ed. 
1129 (1940); see also United States v. Topco Assoc., Inc., 405 U.S. 596, 610, 92 S. Ct. 1126, 31 L. Ed. 2d 515 (1972) (""[N]aked 
restraints of trade are [not] to be tolerated because they are well intended or because they are allegedly developed to increase 
competition.""). "
1398,11," Peake's proposed curative instruction read as follows: I would like to instruct you that this case is not about pricing effects in Puerto Rico or whether prices in Puerto Rico have 
gone up or down. The only questions for you are whether there was a conspiracy as alleged in the indictment and whether 
Frank Peake knowingly and intentionally joined that conspiracy. I also instruct you that the prosecutor mentioned in opening 
statement that this case affected Puerto Rico and Puerto Ricans. This was improper. This case is not to be decided based 
on those factors. Therefore, I instruct you to disregard those [**31]  comments. You should judge this case only on the 
evidence and not an appeal to sympathy or bias. Any such attempts by the prosecution in its opening statement or in the 
questioning of its witnesses should be disregarded. "
1399,12," On this final point, we cannot ignore that a per se violation of Section 1 only requires that ""an antitrust plaintiff [present] either 
direct or circumstantial evidence of defendants' 'conscious commitment to a common scheme designed to achieve an unlawful 
objective.'"" Evergreen Partnering Grp., Inc. v. Pactiv Corp., 720 F.3d 33, 43 (1st Cir. 2013) (quoting Monsanto Co. v. Spray Rite 
Serv. Corp., 465 U.S. 752, 764, 104 S. Ct. 1464, 79 L. Ed. 2d 775 (1984)). "
1402,13," Indeed, we agree that it would have been premature to give one at this early point in the deliberations, after a nine-day trial. "
1410,1," For a very brief time, from May 19, 2009 to June 30, 2009, the Legislature extended the validity period for certificates of need to 
36 months without qualification. See Ch. 2009-45, Laws of Florida, § 1 (amending section 408.040, Fla. Stat. (2009)). Chapter 
2009-223 changed that effective July 1, 2009, to apply to only pre-April 1, 2009 certificates. "
1416,1," Hill-Rom advances the ""discount attribution"" test while Universal contends the ""rule of reason"" most aptly applies in this 
situation. The Court finds Universal's pleading sufficient under either analysis. "
1417,2," See Church, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 35969, 2011 WL 1225912, at *9-10 (distinguishing exclusionary conduct at issue with 
""price-based"" or ""price-squeeze"" claims at issue in Linkline wherein ""pricing itself operates as an exclusionary tool""). "
1423,3," In order to make a claim under Section 3 of the Clayton Act, a plaintiff must (1) identify the relevant product market; (2) identify 
the relevant geographic market; and (3) show that ""competition foreclosed by the agreement constitutes a substantial share of 
the relevant market."" Tampa Elec. Co. v. Nashville Coal Co., 365 U.S. 320, 327-28, 81 S. Ct. 623, 5 L. Ed. 2d 580 (1961). The 
first two factors have been met. Hill-Rom does not dispute that Universal has identified the relevant product market and, as 
discussed above, Universal has alleged an adequate relevant geographic market. [*39] "
1425,4," In challenging the sufficiency of Universal's allegations with respect to this claim, Hill-Rom primarily incorporates by reference 
its arguments from other sections of its memorandum in support of its motion and does not contend there are significant issues 
which are not addressed elsewhere in its arguments. "
1430,1," Due to Top Rank's reliance on group pleading, it is impossible to determine which entity that Top Rank claims attempted to 
acquire Golden Boy Promotions. "
1431,2," Section 1 of the Sherman Act prohibits ""[e]very contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint 
of trade or commerce."" 15 U.S.C. § 1. Despite the literal language of the statute, Section 1 ""outlaw[s] only unreasonable 
restraints."" State Oil Co. v. Khan, 522 U.S. 3, 10, 118 S. Ct. 275, 139 L. Ed. 2d 199 (1997)."
1431,3," Section 2 of the Sherman Act makes it illegal to ""monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other 
person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations ..."" 15 
U.S.C. § 2. "
1433,4," ""Championship-Caliber Boxers"" are defined as ""professional boxers who, within the past three years, have demonstrated 
through such quantitative factors as purse size, television rights, viewership, ticket revenue, and other objective criteria that they 
belong to the 'cream' of the boxing business."" FAC at ¶ 104 (quotations and citations omitted)."
1433,5," Top Rank argues that it need not allege dominance in the promotion market for its conspiracy in restraint of trade claim, relying 
on cases concerning tying arrangements. However, Top Rank's conspiracy claim does not appear to limit itself to tying 
arrangements. See FAC at ¶ 147. "
1435,6," The Haymon Defendants also move to dismiss the tying claim on the grounds that their alleged market power cannot be 
premised on a voluntary contractual relationship. See, e.g., Rick-Mik Enters. Inc. v. Equilon Enters., LLC, 532 F.3d 963, 973 (9th 
Cir. 2008) (""A tying claim generally requires that the defendant's economic power be derived from the market, not from a 
contractual relationship that the plaintiff has entered into voluntarily.""). However, contrary [*27]  to the Haymon Defendants' 
argument, Top Rank alleges that the Haymon Defendants' economic power is derived from the market, not from a voluntary 
contractual relationship. "
1436,7," ""Per se liability is reserved for only those agreements that are 'so plainly anticompetitive that no elaborate study of the industry 
is needed to establish their illegality.'"" Texaco v. Dagher, 547 U.S. 1, 5, 126 S. Ct. 1276, 164 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2006) (quoting Nat'l 
Soc'y of Prof'l Eng'rs v. United States, 435 U.S. 679, 692, 98 S. Ct. 1355, 55 L. Ed. 2d 637 (1978))."
1436,8," In its Opposition, Top Rank contends that it has alleged that the Haymon Defendants have ""never consented"" to allowing 
boxers [*32]  in their management stable to sign with ""legitimate"" promoters, citing to paragraph 65 of the First Amended 
Complaint. See Opposition at p. 26. However, paragraph 65 does not so allege. If Top Rank can, in good faith, allege facts 
showing that the Haymon Defendants have never consented to allowing boxers in their management stable to sign with 
""legitimate promoters,"" Top Rank may be able to state a viable tying claim. "
1437,9," In addition, although [*34]  Top Rank alleges the existence of several other allegedly anticompetitive agreements, as discussed 
infra, the Court concludes that Top Rank has failed to adequately allege an agreement between the Waddell Defendants and the 
Haymon Defendants."
1437,10," Although Top Rank's allegations, for the most part, meet the applicable pleading standard, Top Rank's allegations with respect 
to, for example, the ""exclusivity commitments"" with unspecified broadcasters are vague and lack the requisite factual detail. See 
FAC at ¶ 94. "
1439,11," Although it initially appeared to the Court that Top Rank was attempting to hold the Waddell [*41]  Defendants vicariously or 
indirectly liable for the conduct of the Haymon Defendants (based on their investment in the Haymon Defendants and their 
approval power or veto power over the Haymon Defendants' major decisions), Top Rank adamantly disavows any attempt to 
impose ""indirect or vicarious liability"" on the Waddell Defendants based on a principal-agent relationship between the Waddell 
Defendants and the Haymon Defendants. See Opposition [Docket No. 78] at 7 n. 3. "
1440,12," Top Rank's First Amended Complaint is littered with such conclusory statements and [*44]  hyperbole regarding the Waddell 
Defendants. See, e.g., FAC at ¶ 55 (""The Waddell & Reed Defendants have played an active, complicit, and indispensable role 
in bringing the anticompetitive scheme to fruition.""); ¶ 57 (""The Waddell & Reed Defendants orchestrated an elaborate business 
arrangement to facilitate -- and to try to conceal -- their involvement in the conspiracy.""). "
1441,13," This unity of interest is further supported by Top Rank's allegations that Waddell Defendants and Haymon Defendants are, at 
least to some extent, under common control. See, e.g., FAC at ¶ 15 (alleging that W&R Financial actively manages and controls 
Haymon Holdings, which is ""exercised by its President and General Counsel who sit as MGH's 'Observer' representatives on the 
Haymon Holdings Board of Directors""); ¶ 16 (alleging that WRIMCO's senior officers actively manage and control Haymon "
1442,," Holdings); ¶ 18 (alleging that MGH is a member of Haymon Holdings and ""exercises strategic and operational control"" over 
Haymon Holdings' business activities)."
1442,14," Top Rank argues that it has alleged that the Waddell Defendants are actual competitors in the relevant markets. However, 
those allegations are solely based on the Waddell Defendants' investment and alleged management and control over Haymon 
Holdings. See FAC at ¶ 15 (""[W&R Financial] participates in the managerial and promotional market in California [*50]  through 
its active management and control over Haymon Holdings, exercised by its President and General Counsel who sit as MGH's 
'Observer' representatives on the Haymon Holdings Board of Directors.""); ¶ 16 (""WRIMCO also participates in the managerial 
and promotional market in California through its senior officers' active management and control over and direct financial interest 
in Haymon Holdings.""). "
1444,15," Top Rank does not address any of the state law claims in its Opposition to the Waddell Defendants' Motion to Dismiss, but 
merely incorporates its Opposition to the Haymon Defendants' Motion to Dismiss (even though the Waddell Defendants and 
Haymon Defendants primarily moved to dismiss on different grounds). See Opposition to Waddell Defendants' Motion to Dismiss 
[Docket No. 78] at 20. In its Opposition to the Haymon Defendants' Motion to Dismiss, Top Rank only argues that its UCL claim 
is sufficient based on the ""unlawful"" prong. "
1447,1," The response and surreply to Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification were filed in Ortho's name only because of ongoing 
settlement discussions between plaintiffs and Immucor."
1447,2," Plaintiffs have asked the Court to certify a class of TBR purchasers ""from January 1, 2000 through the present."" Since 
discovery was conducted, however, plaintiffs have consistently asserted that the communications between Ortho and Immucor 
executives at the AABB meeting, which began on November 4, 2000 initiated the alleged price-fixing conspiracy that followed. 
Thus, ""the Court will exercise its discretion to amend the class definition, sua sponte,"" Rendler v. Gambone Bros. Dev. Co., 182 
F.R.D. 152, 160 (E.D. Pa. 1998), and substitute the date ""November 4, 2000"" for the date ""January 1, 2000."" "
1450,3," Plaintiffs presented evidence that Ortho did not charge the BBLP prices to any customer until after it allegedly engaged in 
unlawful price—related conversations with Immucor. At the class certification hearing, the parties disputed the probative value of 
a slide contained in an October 30, 2000, Ortho presentation regarding the BBLP. The slide is labeled ""Communication with 
Customers,"" and it lists the names of seven major customers alongside dates ranging from September [*12]  27, 2000, to 
October 20, 2000. (Pls.' Mot. Ex. 56, at 5.) The record contains no evidence regarding the nature of any communications 
between Ortho and those customers. Ortho contends that the slide establishes that it had already implemented the BBLP prior to 
the alleged price—fixing conspiracy, which plaintiffs contend began in November 2000. Plaintiffs argue that, even if Ortho 
engaged in some kind of discussion with select customers in September and October of 2000, Ortho did not finalize the BBLP 
until after its allegedly unlawful communications with Immucor. On the present state of the record, the Court finds that the slide 
does not establish that Ortho implemented the BBLP before the American Association of Blood Banks (""AABB"") meeting, which 
began on November 4, 2000."
1450,4," At the class certification hearing, Ortho provided the Court with the Supplemental Declarations of Mike Poynter and Bill Weiss, 
two Immucor executives. In those declarations, Poynter and Weiss aver that they do not ""remember anything being said during 
[Ortho's] presentation about a 2001 price increases or anything about Ortho's future pricing plans."" (Supp. Poynter Decl. ¶ 8; see 
also Supp. Weiss Decl. ¶ 5.) [*14]  However, other Immucor employees who attended the AABB meeting testified to the 
contrary. See supra. "
1452,5," Automation tier pricing was awarded to facilities that adhered to the base pricing guidelines, but had Immucor instrumentation. 
(Def.'s Opp. Ex. 99.)"
1452,6, Ortho did not dispute that plaintiffs had satisfied the Rule 23(a) requirements or Rule 23(b)'s superiority requirement. 
1453,7," Plaintiffs also assert that they will prove antitrust impact using: (1) application of the so—called ""Bogosian shortcut,"" (2) Dr. 
Beyer's analysis of the structure of the TBR market, (3) Dr. Beyer's empirical analysis of TBR prices during the class period, and 
(4) documents produced by defendants. See infra Section IV(B)(3)(i)(b). Defendant does not challenge Dr. Beyer's analysis of 
the structure of the TBR market, nor his empirical analysis of TBR prices during the class period in its post—remand briefs. "
1455,8," Ortho does not challenge the qualifications of Dr. Beyer. Dr. Beyer has more than 40 years of experience in applied micro—
economics analysis in the United States, and has testified as an economic expert in numerous antitrust actions during his 
career. (Beyer Report ¶¶ 2, 3.) He also holds several advanced degrees in economics, [*29]  including a Ph.D. from the Fletcher 
School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. (Id. at App'x A.) Upon review of Dr. Beyer's extensive credentials and 
experience, the Court concludes that plaintiffs have demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that Dr. Beyer is qualified 
in the field of economics."
1455,9," Ortho does not dispute the use of a benchmark as a generally accepted methodology for proving antitrust impact and 
damages. See Nichols v. SmithKline Beecham Corp., No. 00-6222, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2049, 2003 WL 302352, at *4 (E.D. "
1456,," Pa. Jan. 29, 2003) (upholding expert's use of benchmark at class certification stage as a ""generally accepted methodology for 
determining impact""). "
1458,10," The Court further notes that even if it were to accept defendant's challenge that OCV is an inappropriate benchmark because 
it was implemented after the initially alleged conspiracy start date in January 2000, Dr. Beyer's use of the OCV plan as a 
benchmark results in a more conservative estimate of damages. In re Linerboard Antitrust Litig., 497 F. Supp. 2d 666, 675 (E.D. 
Pa. 2007). That is because if Dr. Beyer incorrectly assumed a later start date for the conspiracy, and thus, incorrectly assumed 
that the OCV benchmark was free of collusion, then Dr. Beyer's ""but—for price estimate would be too high, causing his estimate 
of the overcharge (the difference between actual prices and but—for prices) to be too low."" Id."
1458,11," The Court previously ruled that the evidence presented by Ortho was insufficient to conclusively establish that the BBLP was 
implemented before the AABB meetings, which began on November 4, 2000. In re Blood Reagents Antitrust Litig., 283 F.R.D. at 
229 n. 2. That factual finding, [*39]  which did not rely on expert testimony, is unaffected by the Third Circuit's remand of this 
case. "
1460,12," By letter dated September 9, 2011, counsel for Ortho explained, in relevant part, that the standard cost data produced by 
Ortho are estimates calculated on a cost per unit basis that are gathered ""approximately four to six months prior to each fiscal 
year as part of [Ortho's] budgeting process. It does not reflect [Ortho's] actual costs of production but is a prediction of what 
[Ortho's] costs will be for the following fiscal year in a limited number of cost categories,"" including, for example, costs of raw 
materials. (See Letter from Paul H. St. Antoine, Esq., Counsel for Ortho, to Jeffrey J. Corrigan, Esq., Counsel for plaintiffs 
(September 9, 2011).) ""Standard cost data is not maintained in [Ortho's] financial accounting system for this entire time period 
[1998 through 2010], so [Ortho] searched its records and manually compiled the standard cost information to the extent it was 
readily available."" (Id.) Ortho's counsel explained in the letter that the specific categories of costs included in standard costs changed over time, and the 
lists of said categories were not readily accessible. (Id.) Thus, Ortho could not determine ""whether [*46]  the change in standard 
costs for a given year [was] a result of a change to the definition of standard costs, or a modification to [Ortho's] manufacturing 
process for a product."" (Id.) The letter added that standard costs did not include ""shipping to customers, selling, marketing, 
general administration, research, or capital improvements."" (Id.) Those costs not included in the standard cost estimates are 
referred to by Ortho as ""Costs Not in Standard"" or ""CNIS."" The Deputy Clerk shall docket a copy of the letter from Ortho's counsel dated September 9, 2011."
1460,13," Ortho cites two cases in which courts have rejected economic analysis as unreliable in failing to account for market factors not 
attributable to the alleged misconduct. See, e.g., Blue Cross and Blue Shield United of Wisconsin v. Marshfield Clinic, 152 F.3d 
588, 593 (7th Cir. 1998) (rejecting statistical study which failed to adjust for any other factor that could have affected the 
independent variable, price in clinical services, except for one, thus effectively attributing the ""entire difference [in price] . . . to 
the [anticompetitive conduct.]""); Lantec, Inc. v. Novell, Inc., 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24816, *19 (D. Utah Feb. 13, 2001) (rejecting 
Dr. Beyer's methodology as ""fail[ing] to address in sufficient manner or degree salient factors not attributable to the defendant's 
alleged wrongdoing that may have caused the harm [*47]  alleged""). "
1461,," The Court finds those cases inapposite. Neither case involved an alleged price fixing conspiracy, nor a proposed benchmark 
methodology for calculating damages. In fact, the Lantec decision did not address expert testimony regarding a proposed 
damages model at all, but rather considered testimony provided by Dr. Beyer on the relevant product market definition in a 
non—class monopoly action involving software markets. Moreover, Blue Cross is a summary judgment opinion, and thus the 
Court did not apply Daubert as the standard for reviewing the expert testimony. In any event, this case is distinguishable 
because Dr. Beyer has considered and analyzed costs and demand. See Patel v. Verde Valley Med. Ctr., No. 05-1129, 2009 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 125464, 2009 WL 5842049, at *4 (D. Ariz. Mar. 31, 2009) (distinguishing case from Lantec because ""although 
flawed in some respects,"" for omitted certain data, expert's benchmark, was not ""totally without foundation""). "
1462,14," Dr. Beyer uses the standard cost data produced by Ortho to calculate gross profit margins for Ortho in the but—for world, but 
again notes that Ortho has represented that its standard cost data is not reliable. (Beyer Reply ¶ 55 n.116; see supra n.12)"
1462,15," The Court is concerned about defendant's use of its failure to produce reliable cost data as both a sword and shield in this 
case. Ortho has represented since 2011 that the standard cost data it produced to plaintiffs is unreliable. (See Letter from Paul 
H. St. Antoine, Esq., Counsel for Ortho, to Jeffrey J. Corrigan, Esq., Counsel for plaintiffs (September 9, 2011).) At the same 
time, Ortho has repeatedly asserted that Immucor's cost data is not a reliable proxy for its own cost data. (See Def.'s Post—
Remand Br. 32-33.) Moreover, as noted above, Ortho's actual cost data was never produced to plaintiffs, and it is unclear 
whether Ortho maintains actual cost data at all. (See Letter from Jeffrey J. Corrigan, Counsel for plaintiffs, to the Court (July 27, 
2015) (detailing Ortho's [*55]  responses to cost data—related interrogatories).) Thus, it is particularly difficult to assess the 
extent of Ortho's cost increases during the class period — and based on the standard cost data produced to plaintiffs, it appears 
that Ortho's standard costs may have even been declining in certain years. (See Beyer Reply 23, Tbls. 2, 3.) Although the 
absence of reliable cost data does not relieve plaintiffs of the burden of demonstrating by a preponderance of the evidence that "
1463,," Dr. Beyer's expert testimony is reliable, it does undermine defendant's argument that Dr. Beyer's OCV benchmark methodology 
should be excluded on this ground. The Deputy Clerk shall docket a copy of the letter from plaintiffs' counsel dated July 27, 2015. "
1465,16," Despite the fact that costs actually decreased in certain years for particular Ortho products, Dr. Beyer did not alter the but—for 
price of those products to reflect those decreases. (Beyer Reply ¶ 56 n.118.) This is another way in which Ortho's market power 
as a duopolist is accounted for under Dr. Beyer's cost-margin methodology."
1465,17," At the Post—Remand Hearing, Ortho raised the argument that the cost—margin approach is an unreliable method for 
establishing but—for prices in this case because the but—for world is a duopoly. That argument is unavailing. As Ortho's own 
economic expert Dr. Bronsteen has explained, the literature on duopoly includes ""a wide range"" of models, ""and the predictions 
of the duopoly models range from situations where a duopoly could replicate perfect competition to models where the duopoly 
replicates a monopoly pricing . . . ."" (7/26/15 Hr'g Tr. 167:12-20; see also [*65]  Id. at 387:6-11 (Dr. Beyer: ""[W]hat oligopoly 
theory teaches us [is] that behavioral reactions, responses, by one or the other oligopolist, even in a duopoly, can mean that 
prices simply . . . can go to the competitive or to the monopoly level."").) Thus, to argue that the cost—margin approach cannot 
be applied when the market structure is a duopoly merely because it is only appropriate in perfectly competitive marketplaces 
oversimplifies the range of behavior firms may exhibit in duopolies. Furthermore, Ortho fails to cite to any cases rejecting the 
cost—margin approach to assessing damages based on the fact that the market structure is a duopoly, as it urges the Court do 
in this case. Thus, the Court does not exclude Dr. Beyer's cost-approach methodology on this basis. "
1466,18," The Court applied that standard in its August 22, 2012 decision, and concluded that RhoGAM and TBR were ""fair congeners."" 
In re Blood Reagents Antitrust Litig., 283 F.R.D. at 245. Many courts, however, have held that the question whether plaintiffs have met their burden of proving comparability should be 
left to the trier of fact to resolve because comparability challenges generally involve weighing facts. See In re Prograf Antitrust 
Litig., No. 11-02242, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 180899, 2014 WL 7641156, at *3 (D. Mass. Dec. 23, 2014) (citing decisions that 
have declined to resolve factual issues underlying comparability analysis in the context of Rule 702 motions); see also 1 Am. Bar 
Ass'n, Antitrust Law Developments 786 (7th ed. 2012) (""Whether [*69]  the plaintiff has met this burden of showing 
comparability ordinarily is a question for the trier of fact.""). "
1467,19," Ortho also asserts that Dr. Beyer has not compared costs between the two products. The Court will not exclude Dr. Beyer's 
yardstick methodology on this ground because 1) Ortho has not produced RhoGAM cost data (Beyer Reply ¶ 58 fn.124)); 2) 
even if cost changes varied significantly for [*72]  RhoGAM during the class period, it would support Dr. Beyer's contention that, 
like prices for TBR, RhoGAM prices were primarily driven by the level of competition, rather than cost and demand (Id. at ¶67); 
and 3) there are other significant reasons proffered by Dr. Beyer as to why RhoGAM is a reliable yardstick. (See supra (citing 
Beyer Reply ¶¶ 61-67).) "
1469,20," The Court reiterates that it amends the class definition, sua sponte, to substitute the date ""November 4, 2000"" for the date 
""January 1, 2000."" "
1475,21, Defendant has not challenged this expert testimony under Daubert in the post—remand proceedings. 
1476,22, The Court reiterates that this expert testimony has not been challenged under Daubert in the post—remand proceedings. 
1478,23, Ortho did not raise any additional challenges under Comcast beyond those discussed supra. 
1545,1," We emphasize that the allegations against defendants are nothing more than allegations. Even where we omit to use a word 
such as ""alleged"" in reference to claims against defendants, nothing in this opinion should be taken as a finding that any

1546,3," Although this is a new holding, it is not an entirely new concept. As we wrote in LIBOR I, plaintiffs' theory ""that defendants 
competed normally in the interbank loan market and then agreed to lie about the interest rates they were paying in that market . .

1547,4," At this stage, there remains some uncertainty regarding which affiliates of some banks were official members of the LIBOR 
panel. Each defendant presumably knows which of its corporate entities prepared and submitted quotes, and we expect this 
question to be answered definitively in discovery, preferably through a stipulation."
1547,5," Throughout this opinion, we utilize some jargon related to swaps. A trader who agrees to pay a fixed rate and receive a floating 
rate is said to have traded a ""pay-fixed"" swap, and would be injured by artificial suppression of the swap's floating interest rate. 
The most common documentation underlying swaps is an ""ISDA agreement,"" published by the International Swaps and 
Derivatives Association. "
1548,6," Auction-rate securities are a new entry in the field of securities litigated in this MDL. As explained in part by the City of 
Houston's amended complaint, ¶ 395, the issuer of an auction-rate security was required to pay a floating rate depending on the 
result of a weekly auction. In early 2008, the auctions began to fail, meaning that the bondholders were unable [*100]  to sell 
their bonds at auction. As a result, the issuer was contractually obligated to pay the bondholders according to a ""fail rate 
formula"" that incorporated LIBOR. Effectively, the auction-rate securities at issue became ordinary LIBOR-based floating-rate 
bonds after early 2008."
1548,7, A basis point is 0.01%.

1549,9," Société Générale, which replaced HBOS on the USD LIBOR panel in early 2009 maintains that plaintiffs have failed to plead 
plausible allegations that Société Générale participated in persistent suppression. We disagree. At least one complaint, cited in 
plaintiffs' briefing, shows that Société Générale's LIBOR submissions were as much as 60 basis points below the Federal 
Reserve's Eurodollar index, which plaintiffs plausibly maintain to be a good proxy for ""true LIBOR."" See Philadelphia Compl.,

1553,21," It appears that BATA, like many municipal plaintiffs, traded LIBOR-based swaps as a hedge. If these swaps hedged LIBOR-
based bonds, then it is not clear that LIBOR manipulation could have caused any damage. See BPP Ill., LLC v. Royal Bank of 
Scotland Grp., PLC, No. 13-cv-638 (JMF), 2013 WL 6003701, at n.3, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 161761, at n.3 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 13,

presumably would have suffered injury from its imperfect hedge."

Securities Act claims. "
1561,36," Relying on Recurrent Capital Bridge Fund I, LLC v. ISR Sys. & Sensors Corp., defendants argue that ""[i]f a defendant rebuts 
plaintiffs' unsupported allegations with direct, highly specific, testimonial evidence regarding a fact essential to jurisdiction—and 
plaintiffs do not counter that evidence—the allegation may be deemed refuted."" 875 F. Supp. 2dc 297, 304 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) 
(internal quotation marks omitted). Whatever the virtues of that rule, the Second Circuit has squarely repudiated it. See 
Dorchester Fin., 722 F.3d at 86 & n.4. "
1562,37," Plaintiffs devote a substantial portion of their brief to discussion of how state and federal courts in the various states in which 
they have filed their complaints have interpreted the requirements of personal jurisdiction. But because defendants do not rely 
on state long-arm statutes and we must follow Second Circuit law as to federal issues, citation of such authorities is mostly 
irrelevant or repetitious. However, we do not anticipate that our present jurisdictional conclusions would be different under 
precedents of other circuits. Certainly, [*143]  plaintiffs' brief fails to identify material distinctions in the law of the relevant federal 
circuits."
1562,38," The Manual for Complex Litigation, Fourth (2004) suggests that an MDL plaintiff might avoid Lexecon by ""fil[ing] an amended 
complaint asserting venue in the transferee district,"" id. § 20.132, at 224. [*144]  However, the Manual does not cite authority for 
such a procedure, nor does it appear to argue that it would be proper at a plaintiff's unilateral instance. See id. at 224 n.668 
(stating that if an amended complaint alleges venue in the transferee district, ""the court and parties should take care to ensure a 
common understanding of the document's intent and significance""). Of course, a plaintiff may file a new complaint in a new 
forum, as the NCUA has already done, but the new complaint will not necessarily relate back to the original complaint for 
limitations purposes. "
1563,39," Defendants challenge the constitutional viability of the national contacts approach, citing Daimler, Walden, and Porina v. 
Marward Shipping Co., 521 F.3d 122 (2d Cir. 2008). As defendants acknowledge, Porina applied rather than rejected national 
contacts analysis. See Porina, 521 F.3d at 127. And neither Daimler nor Walden involved a federal statute containing a 
nationwide service provision. See Walden, 134 S. Ct. at 1121; Daimler, 134 S. Ct. at 753. Nothing in these decisions so much as 
hints that the national contacts rule might be unconstitutional where it is supported by a federal statute."
1563,40," The Second Circuit also recognizes a version of pendent personal jurisdiction under which a federal court may ""entertain 
[state-law] claims that are not expressly covered by the long-arm statute, so long as they derive from the same nucleus of 
operative fact as claims that are."" Hanly v. Powell Goldstein, L.L.P., 290 F. App'x 435, 438 (2d Cir. 2008) (summary order); see 
Hargrave v. Oki Nursery, Inc., 646 F.2d 716 (2d Cir. 1980). This judge-made exception to the general rule that a federal court 
must ""look to the law of the forum state to determine whether personal jurisdiction must lie,"" Licci II, 732 F.3d at 168; see Fed. R. 
Civ. P. 4(k)(1)(A), has no direct bearing to the present motions, [*147]  in which defendants do not rely on the limitations of any 
state's long-arm statute. To the extent that plaintiffs suggest that this doctrine would permit a federal court to exercise personal 
jurisdiction over pendent or otherwise ""supplemental"" claims unrelated to defendants' contacts with the forum state in the 
absence of a federal statute or rule authorizing such jurisdiction, we reject the suggestion as beyond the scope of Hargrave and 
unsupported by authority. Cf. Arrowsmith, 320 F.2d at 227 (""[N]either the federal legislature nor the federal rule-makers have 
had any intention to displace state statutes as to the taking of jurisdiction over foreign corporations in ordinary diversity cases."")."
1563,41," But see Nicholas v. Saul Stone & Co., 224 F.3d 179, 185 (3d Cir. 2000) (holding that 7 U.S.C. § 25(c) is ""a venue provision, 
not a jurisdictional one""). We do not find the Third Circuit's reasoning persuasive because the service provision of the CEA 
substantially tracks that of the Securities Exchange Act, which the Second Circuit has interpreted to express Congress's intent to "
1564,," extend personal jurisdiction to the outer limit of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Compare 15 U.S.C. § 78aa(a) 
(Securities Exchange Act), with 7 U.S.C. § 25(c); see Amaranth, 587 F. Supp. 2d at 526 & n.70 (citing Leasco, 468 F.2d at 
1339). "
1565,42," Although we reject plaintiffs' arguments concerning the moving defendants, we have no reason to doubt that [*153]  we would 
have upheld general personal jurisdiction over certain non-moving defendants on the bases of place of incorporation or principal 
place of business. "
1566,43," Plaintiffs rely on In re Hellas Telecommunications (Luxembourg) II SCA, 524 B.R. 488 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 2015), which held that 
Deutsche Bank's United States assets and operations were sufficiently ""substantial"" and ""long-term"" as to render it ""at home"" in 
the United States under Daimler. Id. at 507-08. In light of the recent leading Supreme Court and Second Circuit cases, we 
cannot agree with the bankruptcy [*155]  court's conclusion that even very substantial corporate operations (regardless of 
whether measured in money, personnel, space, or time) in a given forum suffice to make a defendant at home in the forum. See 
Daimler, 134 S. Ct. at 762 n.20 (""[T]he general jurisdiction inquiry does not focus solely on the magnitude of the defendant's in-
state contacts."" (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted)). "
1567,44," For more recent discussions of the competing approaches of federal and state courts, see Tamburo v. Dworkin, 601 F.3d 693, 
708-09 (7th Cir. 2010); Dudnikov v. Chalk & Vermilion Fine Arts, Inc., 514 F.3d 1063, 1078-79 (10th Cir. 2008); O'Connor v. 
Sandy Lane Hotel Co., 496 F.3d 312, 318-20 (3d Cir. 2007); Robinson v. Harley-Davidson Motor Co., 354 Or. 572, 581-94, 316 
P.3d 287, 293-300 (2013); Moki Mac River Expeditions v. Drugg, 221 S.W.3d 569, 579-85 (Tex. 2007). As noted above, we are 
bound to follow Second Circuit precedent as to issues of federal law, even though some cases may ultimately be remanded to 
courts in other circuits."
1567,45," Thus, the Second Circuit recently characterized as ""dicta"" the discussion in Chew ""that the 'relatedness' test under the Due 
Process Clause may require proof of either but-for or proximate causation."" Licci ex rel. Licci v. Lebanese Canadian Bank, SAL 
(Licci I), 673 F.3d 50, 71 (2d Cir. 2012)."
1567,46," See Licci II, 732 F.3d at 171 (finding jurisdiction in New York on the basis of the defendant's use of a correspondent account in 
New York ""as an instrument for accomplishing the alleged wrongs for which the plaintiffs seek redress""); Chloe v. Queen Bee of 
Beverly Hills, LLC, 616 F.3d 158, 166-67 (2d Cir. 2010) (finding jurisdiction in New York on the basis of an ""act of an out-of-state 
defendant employee shipping an item into New York"" plus other, related, contacts); [*159]  Bank Brussels Lambert, 305 F.3d at 
128 (finding jurisdiction in New York over a claim that a law firm had engaged in malpractice in connection with a New York 
transaction); Kernan v. Kurz-Hastings, Inc., 175 F.3d 236, 243-44 (2d Cir. 1999) (upholding jurisdiction in New York where the 
defendant's exclusive distribution agreement established its ""attempt to serve the New York market""); Chew, 143 F.3d at 30 
(finding jurisdiction in Rhode Island for claim of wrongful death at sea where decedent had been recruited to the ship's crew in 
Rhode Island)."
1567,47," Plaintiffs appear to acknowledge that a ""but for"" relationship between the claim and the defendant's forum-related contacts is a 
minimum requirement of due process in the context of specific personal jurisdiction. See Pls.' PJ Mem. 43, 53 (relying on AirWair 
Int'l Ltd. v. Schultz, 73 F. Supp. 3d 1225, 2014 WL 5871580, at *8, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 159415, at *25-26 (N.D. Cal. 2014), 
and Breathwit Marine Contractors, Ltd. v. Deloach Marine Servs., LLC, 994 F. Supp. 2d 845, 852-53 (S.D. Tex. 2014)). "
1568,48," Because we find no factual support for the conspiracy theory of personal jurisdiction, we need not address defendants' general 
legal challenges to it, including defendants' argument that it is inconsistent with the Supreme Court's statement that personal 
jurisdiction ""must arise out of contacts that the 'defendant himself' creates with the forum State."" Walden, 134 S. Ct. at 1122 
(quoting Burger King, 471 U.S. at 475) (emphasis in Burger King [*162] ). "
1569,49," As noted above, we may dismiss claims on the merits when multiple defendants, some of which are subject to the Court's 
personal jurisdiction, challenge the sufficiency of allegations on the same grounds and we find such challenge meritorious. See 
Chevron, 667 F.3d at 246 n.17. Thus, it is unnecessary for us to engage in an intricate and fact-bound analysis, as to each 
defendant, of whether its ""marketing"" activities in a given [*165]  state rose to a jurisdictionally sufficient level."
1569,50," As discussed above, HN18[
] specific personal jurisdiction [*166]  requires, at a minimum, a ""but for"" relationship between 
the claim and the defendant's forum-related contacts. The presence of ""marketing"" contacts may bolster an argument for specific 
personal jurisdiction on the basis of a claim arising out of a defendant's forum-related contacts, but cannot create specific 
personal jurisdiction over a claim that is wholly unrelated to the forum. Cf. Bank Brussels Lambert, 305 F.3d at 128 (holding that 
law firm's marketing efforts in New York supported finding personal jurisdiction over a claim arising out of the firm's New York-
directed engagement). "
1570,51," The NCUA brought suit in Kansas on [*169]  the basis, in part, of swap agreements entered into with U.S. Central (a Kansas 
credit union) and four non-Kansas credit unions. See NCUA Am. Compl. ¶¶ 6-10, 236-293. To be clear, the principles described 
herein do not support the exercise of specific personal jurisdiction in Kansas over contractual or other claims having no 
connection to Kansas. Plaintiffs' brief argues that defendants ""engaged with U.S. Central . . . to execute many of their LIBOR-
based transactions with other credit unions across the country, including the [four other] Credit Unions at issue in the NCUA 
Complaint"" and also that ""each Credit Union routed [trades] through U.S. Central."" Pls.' PJ Mem. 44. However, because plaintiffs 
cite nothing in the complaint or declarations that specifically supports these assertions, we disregard them. "
1571,52," See, e.g., Decl. of Patrick Gonsalves, at ¶ 16, ECF No. 759 (Barclays LIBOR [*171]  submissions were determined in and 
transmitted from London); Decl. of Kevin P. McKendry, at ¶ 9, ECF No. 781 (Lloyds submissions were made in London); Decl. of 
Osamu Takashima, at ¶ 6, ECF No. 782 (Norinchukin submissions were made from England); Decl. of William Gougherty, at ¶ 
15, ECF No. 784 (RBS submissions were made from the United Kingdom); Decl. of Dominique Bourrinet, at ¶ 10, ECF No. 785 
(Société Générale submissions were determined in Paris and transmitted from London); Decl. of Frank Borstelmann, at ¶ 10, 
ECF No. 786 (Portigon submissions were made in London)."
1571,53," The parties disagree as to whether the New York contacts of nonparty Thomson Reuters, which is alleged to have been the 
BBA's agent for the purposes of calculating and distributing LIBOR, are jurisdictionally significant. It suffices simply to say that 
the allegation that Thomson Reuters ""is headquartered in New York,"" Kaas Decl. ¶ 21, has no bearing on whether defendants 
are subject to personal jurisdiction in New York or elsewhere."
1571,54," The well-reasoned opinion in 7 West 57th Street Realty Co. v. Citigroup, Inc., No. 13 Civ. 981 (PGG), 2015 WL 1514539, 2015 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44031 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 31, 2015), is not to the contrary. There, the plaintiff failed to connect their allegations that 
New York-based traders had engaged in LIBO-Rrelated misconduct to plaintiff's claim. See 2015 WL 1514539, at *10, 2015 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 44031, at *36 (""Plaintiff has not pled facts suggesting that the conduct of the two Barclays employees has any 
connection with the injury suffered by [the plaintiff], or that the misconduct alluded to in the article took place [*173]  within the 
relevant time period . . . .""). In other words, the plaintiff's claims against Barclays did not arise out of its New York conduct. We 
agree that allegations of some misconduct in New York do not support personal jurisdiction as to unrelated claims. In particular, 
we do not suggest that allegations concerning trader-based misconduct in New York would support personal jurisdiction in New 
York for persistent suppression claims."
1571,55," This distinguishes the present cases from the typical commodities or securities manipulation case, in which defendant's 
conduct is intended to affect the prices of commodities or securities listed in, for example, New York or Chicago. See, e.g., 
CFTC v. Amaranth Advisors, L.L.C., 554 F. Supp. 2d 523, 530 (S.D.N.Y. 2008); In re Natural Gas Commodity Litig., 337 F. 
Supp. 2d 498, 517 (S.D.N.Y. 2004). "
1572,56," This clause is standard in the 1992 version of the ISDA Master Agreement. See Paul C. Harding, Mastering the ISDA Master 
Agreements (1992 and 2002) 126-27 (3d ed. 2010). Although the parties have not called it to our attention, the revised 2002 
version of the Master Agreement contains the language ""relating to any dispute arising out of or in connection with this 
Agreement."" Id. at 312. To the extent that any of the Master Agreements in this case follow the 2002 version, our conclusion is 
unchanged. "
1573,57," Use of the phrase ""relating to this Agreement"" distinguishes Arma v. Buyseasons, Inc., 591 F. Supp. 2d 637, 645 (S.D.N.Y. 
2008), in which the forum selection clause used the narrower language ""arising under this Agreement."" Cf. Phillips, 494 F.3d at 
389 (concluding that scope of ""arise out of"" is narrower than scope of ""relate to"")."
1573,58," This conclusion is bolstered by the Second Circuit's discussion of the 1992 ISDA Master Agreement in Finance One Public 
Co. v. Lehman Bros. Special Financing, Inc., 414 F.3d 325 (2d Cir. 2005). There, the Second Circuit interpreted the Master 
Agreement's choice of law clause narrowly, but observed that ""[t]he forum-selection clause in the Master Agreement is 
admittedly broader than the choice-of-law clause"" and that the forum selection clause ""ha[d] been given its full effect"" when a 
""claim of an extra-contractual setoff right[ was] heard in the contractually selected forum."" Id. at 335. While this discussion was 
dicta, as only the scope of the choice of law clause was at issue, it supports our view that the ISDA forum selection clause 
reaches beyond purely [*180]  contractual claims. "
1574,59," Plaintiffs, relying on Atlantic Marine Construction Co. v. U.S. District Court, 571 U.S.    , 134 S. Ct. 568, 187 L. Ed. 2d 487 
(2013), argue that the appropriate remedy for violation of a forum-selection clause is transfer [*182]  to the appropriate venue 
pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a) rather than dismissal. In Atlantic Marine, the Supreme Court held that a district court should not 
deny a section 1404(a) motion premised on a valid forum selection clause absent ""extraordinary circumstances unrelated to the 
convenience of the parties."" 134 S. Ct. at 581. The Supreme Court expressly reserved judgment on whether a forum-selection 
clause could be the basis of a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). See id. at 580. Thus, Atlantic Marine does not disturb 
Second Circuit precedent holding that a court may enforce a forum selection clause by granting a motion to dismiss. Further, as 
explained in section 7.1 below, we are without power to order a § 1404(a) transfer in this MDL context. "
1575,60," The ""affirmative relief"" doctrine holds that a defendant impliedly consents to jurisdiction [*184]  when the defendant itself 
brings suit in the same forum concerning the same transaction or occurrence. See Dow Chem. Co. v. Calderon, 422 F.3d 827, 
834 (9th Cir. 2005); Gen. Contracting & Trading Co. v. Interpole, Inc., 940 F.2d 20, 23-25 (1st Cir. 1991). Defendants' success in 
having certain claims dismissed with prejudice in the earlier Schwab cases does not constitute affirmative relief under this 
doctrine."
1575,61," Unlike defendants, we are unpersuaded that the Supreme Court's decision in Walden dramatically revised the law of specific 
personal jurisdiction. Nonetheless, in Gucci, the Second Circuit concluded that the appropriate course of action was to remand 
for the district court to consider the appellant's specific personal jurisdictional arguments in the first instance, without considering 
whether those arguments had been waived or forfeited. See Gucci, 768 F.3d at 138."
1575,62," Because our conclusion depends on the particular procedural circumstances, it is not inconsistent with the recent 
decision [*186]  in the Yen LIBOR case precluding a personal jurisdiction argument made by certain defendants that had 
previously made a ""deliberate, strategic decision to give [the] Court the impression that they had forgone making . . . motions [to 
dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction]."" Order at 5, Laydon v. Mizuho Bank, Ltd., No. 12-cv-3419 (GBD), 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
107728 (S.D.N.Y. July 24, 2015), ECF No. 490."
1575,63," To the extent that plaintiffs are unable to complete such a spreadsheet in accordance with our rulings, they should describe 
with particularity the information that they require and that is not in their possession. "
1576,64," These rulings apply to specific personal jurisdiction only, as we have rejected the plaintiffs' arguments for that general 
personal jurisdiction exists as to the moving defendants."
1576,65," Claims against other ""counterparties,"" such as brokers in their capacity as counterparties fail on the merits. See infra at note 
90 and page 186."
1576,66," In principle, tortious interference claims may be pleaded against non-affiliates, but we are aware of no viable examples."
1576,67," To the extent that fraud claims depend on particular representations other than on the basis of their LIBOR submissions, as 
with the LIBOR ""marketing"" claims, we dismiss those claims on the merits. "
1577,68," Plaintiffs' allegation that the BBA's agent, Thomson [*191]  Reuters, was headquartered in New York does not logically imply 
that the BBA or Thomson Reuters calculated LIBOR in New York."
1577,69," In re Electronic Books Antitrust Litig., No. 11-md-2293 (DLC), 2014 WL 1642813, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 57414 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 
24, 2014), is not on point both because, as a parens patriæ action, it was amenable to transfer for trial under 28 U.S.C. § 
1407(h), and because the court found that the defendant was estopped from opposing venue in the transferee court. See 2014 
WL 1642813, at *14, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 57414, at *43-44."
1577,70," Plaintiffs rightly observe that some courts have held or at least assumed that, notwithstanding Lexecon, an MDL transferee 
court may retain a member case for trial on the consent of all [*193]  parties. See, e.g., In re Brand-Name Prescription Drugs 
Antitrust Litig., 264 F. Supp. 2d 1372, 1377 n.4 (J.P.M.L. 2003). Here, of course, defendants have not agreed to a ""Lexecon 
waiver."" "
1578,71," These circumstances distinguish In re Ski Train Fire in Kaprun, Austria on Nov. 11, 2000, 257 F. Supp. 2d 717, 734-35 & n.31 
(S.D.N.Y. 2003), in which it was clear that there was only one possibly appropriate venue in the United States. "
1579,72," Understandably, some individual plaintiffs have chosen to focus solely on a theory of persistent suppression. Trader-based 
manipulation, as disclosed so far, tended to shade LIBOR by fractions of basis points, while persistent suppression may have 
skewed LIBOR by dozens of basis points, potentially causing far greater losses. Furthermore, for plaintiffs who received floating 
rates through stable, long-term positions, trader-based manipulation cut in their favor as often as it cut against them, while 
persistent suppression was always harmful. For these plaintiffs, trader-based manipulation, causing less injury, is more difficult 
to plead."
1579,73," A single bank's upward manipulation, by itself, cannot have affected published LIBOR if the bank's manipulated quote 
nevertheless was in the bottom quartile or tied with quotes in the bottom [*197]  quartile. Likewise, a single bank's downward 
manipulation, by itself, cannot have affected published LIBOR if the bank's manipulated quote was in the top quartile or tied with 
quotes in the top quartile."
1579,74," For example, as of May 22, 2015, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange reported 9,751 open contracts in 1-month Eurodollar 
futures, compared with 11,504,967 contracts in 3-month futures. See CME Group, ftp://ftp.cmegroup.com/pub/settle /stlint (daily 
price and volume data for interest-rate products) (last visited May 26, 2015, 3:47 P.M.). "
1580,75," It is conceivable that a bank's downward manipulation could affect LIBOR even though the bank ultimately falls into the upper 
quartile, but only if at least one other bank suppresses LIBOR on the same day. See infra at note 140. We have not seen this circumstance arise in the context of trader-based manipulation, mostly because there are very few dates 
when multiple banks manipulated LIBOR for the benefit of traders. However, it is likely that, in the context of persistent 
suppression, some banks will be liable in part for suppression even though their submissions fell in the upper quartile."
1580,76," This includes allegations that Barclays collaborated with other banks to manipulate LIBOR on October 26, 2006, February 28, 
2007, and March 29, 2007. "
1581,77," Nevertheless, no plaintiff is dismissed as a party, because each plaintiff plausibly states that he traded throughout the period 
of persistent suppression."
1581,78," The Amabile Plaintiffs need not participate in this project, except to the extent that they wish to add new information from 
Deutsche Bank's recent settlements."
1581,79," The one exception is that plaintiffs may include allegations using newly revealed information from Deutsche Bank's recent 
settlements. "
1583,80," Prudential appears to accept that this principle applies to New Jersey RICO as well, as Prudential [*208]  alleges that the 
relevant enterprise was ""[d]efendants' collective association, including as members of the BBA's USD Libor panel."" Prudential 
Am. Compl. ¶ 460. "
1585,81," Plaintiffs' supplemental submission, referring to a Deutsche Bank Consent Order, supports the conclusion that some banks 
were aware of other banks' inaccurate LIBOR reports. On June 3, 2008, a Deutsche Bank submitter wrote, ""[B]anks have wised 
up to the fact that if they leave their second bid much lower (every bank can put 2 separate bids in) all it takes is for one person 
to get filled at that lower price for the whole alotment [sic] to be filled there. So the low rate doesn't tell us there is necessarily 
lower demand particularly given the bid to cover was higher. It will however keep 1m libor down and also help to bring the 
eur/usd fwds back to [*215]  the left."" Consent Order ¶ 50, Deutsche Bank AG (N.Y. State Dep't of Fin. Servs. Apr. 23, 2015). 
Whatever this means, it does not appear to indicate a conspiracy. At the most, it shows that Deutsche Bank was aware that (1) 
banks were suppressing USD LIBOR, and (2) banks had found a clever way to cover their suppression to some extent."
1585,82," The Barclays employee's metaphor is apt. The defender of a medieval castle did not shield his head behind a parapet out of 
an agreement with his comrades to do so, but because he wished for his own sake to avoid his enemy's arrows. "
1587,83," Defendants argue that Alabama, Georgia, Illinois, Kansas, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Texas do not recognize a cause of action 
for aiding and abetting a tort (especially fraud). We do not examine the law of Alabama, Georgia, Illinois, Kansas, or Ohio at this 
time because defendants have retreated from their initial insistence that the substantive home-state law of each failed bank 
applies in FDIC. See Spreadsheet (""Joint Conflicts Spreadsheet"") at 13 n.24, Mar. 9, 2015, ECF No. 1097-2. We agree with 
Houston and the Philadelphia Plaintiffs that Pennsylvania and Texas would likely recognize [*221]  an aiding and abetting 
theory, although neither state's Supreme Court has decided the question. See Adelphia Recovery Trust v. Bank of Am., N.A., 
624 F. Supp. 2d 292, 309-12 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (thoroughly examining Pennsylvania law), reconsideration granted in part on other 
grounds, No. 05-cv-9050 (LMM), 2009 WL 1676077, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 51460 (S.D.N.Y. June 16, 2009); Crisp v. Sw. 
Bancshares Leasing Co., 586 S.W.2d 610 (Tex. Civ. App. Amarillo 1979) (affirming jury verdict of liability for aiding and abetting 
fraud); cf. Skipworth ex rel. Williams v. Lead Indus. Ass'n, 547 Pa. 224, 234-35, 690 A.2d 169, 174 (1997) (applying 
Restatement approach to conspiracy and ""concert of action"" claim, and affirming dismissal of complaint for insufficient pleading); 
Juhl v. Airington, 936 S.W.2d 640, 643-45 (Tex. 1996) (declining to accept or reject ""concert of action"" theory when plaintiff failed 
to demonstrate defendant's substantial assistance of a tort). "
1588,84," No party has adopted our suggestion at oral argument that New York choice-of-law principles may point to English law, 
especially as to false data claims. "
1589,85," Defendants, in their opening brief, stated that the elements of fraud are essentially the same in every relevant jurisdiction. 
Defendants were on notice that Capital Ventures was a Caymanian entity, and [*227]  so defendants presumably intended this 
statement to encompass Caymanian law. However, defendants did not provide any citation to Caymanian law, binding Privy 
Council precedent, or persuasive English precedent. "
1590,86," We have previously accepted, in the context of the Exchange-Based Plaintiffs' claims, that current LIBOR manipulation affects 
the market's estimate of future LIBOR. See LIBOR I, 935 F. Supp. 2d at 716. "
1592,87," These plaintiffs' inability to find a true manipulation boosts our confidence that there is nothing to the allegations of those 
plaintiffs who submitted less specific pleadings."
1592,88," Some contracts (for example, CUSIP 64352VFZ9, listed in Prudential's complaint) did require the calculation agent to 
generate its own estimate of inter-bank rates, but only in the event that LIBOR was not published on a particular date. "
1593,89," According to these provisions, most types of breaches do not become ""Events of Default"" until notice has been given and a 
grace period has passed, but a breach can be a ""Potential Event of Default"" immediately. "
1595,90," This set of entities plausibly includes the panel banks themselves and entities that employed swap dealers, who appear to 
have interacted closely with LIBOR submitters at many institutions. However, no complaint [*246]  supports a conclusion that 
brokerage entities possessed inside information regarding LIBOR manipulation."
1595,91," This analysis applies with equal force to the Philadelphia Plaintiffs' termination of swaps whose payments were based on 
SIFMA's Municipal Swap Index. The relevant fact is that the parties improvidently relied on LIBOR to estimate the future 
payments. It is irrelevant whether those future payments were themselves defined with reference to LIBOR itself, the Municipal 
Swap Index, or any other index. The Darby Plaintiffs mention swap terminations generally, but fail to identify any particular swap terminations that were affected 
by the manipulated LIBOR forward curve. "
1598,92," As an entirely distinct limit, a plaintiff may not sue its own counterparty for fraud on the basis of false LIBOR submissions. If a 
plaintiff's counterparty manipulated LIBOR to plaintiff's disadvantage, then the counterparty breached the implied covenant of 
good faith and fair dealing, and is properly liable in contract and not as a duplicative fraud claim. This is so, even though plaintiff 
would be unable to obtain punitive damages in contract. See Koch Indus., Inc. v. Hoechst AG, 727 F. Supp. 2d 199, 214 n.20 
(S.D.N.Y. 2010). "
1599,93," We of course express no view regarding the proper scope of the ""expected reliance class"" on the facts of Rio Grande or the 
court's conclusion that the Rio Grande plaintiffs failed to allege that the HSC Index ""represent[ed] or [*260]  [wa]s calculated to 
represent true supply and demand. 786 F. Supp. 2d at 1208. According to the allegations in this case, the leading purpose of 
LIBOR was its incorporation into common financial contracts, and its leading virtue its accuracy. "
1600,94," The plaintiff in Pasternack asserted that the defendant falsely reported plaintiff's drug-testing results to the Federal Aviation 
Administration, causing plaintiff to lose his pilot's license."
1600,95," We include auction-rate securities in this holding. LIBOR was intended to be integrated into financial contracts. Even if 
LIBOR's use as a ""backup"" interest rate was comparatively uncommon, this use still falls comfortably within the intended 
purposes of LIBOR."
1600,96," This includes the Schwab Plaintiffs, who ostensibly relied on LIBOR to buy non-LIBOR-based bonds in preference to LIBOR-
based instruments."
1600,97," Some plaintiffs have every reason to avoid theories of efficient markets. If the market in interest rate swaps was efficient 
during the persistent suppression period, then the fixed-leg pricing would have compensated for LIBOR suppression. Plaintiffs 
who entered into pay-fixed swaps in the middle of 2008 would have received fair settlements as long as suppression persisted, 
and better-than-fair settlements once LIBOR returned to its natural level. "
1601,98," Of course, if by chance a particular defendant's manipulation did not affect LIBOR on a particular day, then defendant would 
not be liable for damages. Our pleading standards properly account for this. A trader-based plaintiff must show an effect on a 
particular LIBOR on a particular day. At this stage, a persistent suppression plaintiff need not, because defendants allegedly 
manipulated LIBOR simultaneously [*267]  on such a large scale that it is plausible that all the defendants affected LIBOR on 
each day. "
1602,99," The ""calculation agent"" for an asset-backed security serves a different function——splitting the loan servicer's proceeds 
among the tiers of beneficiaries. It is not clear whether this calculation depends on LIBOR. To the extent it does, our conclusions 
in this section carry forward."
1602,100," The parties disagree whether a plaintiff's reliance need be reasonable, justifiable, or (under Texas law) neither. See, e.g., 
Gordon & Co. v. Ross, 84 F.3d 542, 546 (2d Cir. 1996) (""The proper test of reliance in a fraud case is not 'reasonable' reliance, it 
is 'justifiable' reliance, a clearly less burdensome test.""); Koral Indus., Inc. v. Sec.-Conn. Life Ins. Co., 788 S.W.2d 136, 146 (Tex. 
App. Dallas) (""[A] jury finding that the defrauded party, by the exercise of reasonable diligence, should have known of the false 
representations is immaterial.""), application for writ of error denied, 802 S.W.2d 650 (Tex. 1990) (per curiam). We do not resolve 
this question because our conclusions would be the same as to either ""justifiable"" or ""reasonable"" reliance, and we use the two 
words interchangeably. "
1604,101," HN45[
] Rule 9(b) applies to negligent misrepresentation, which is in the nature of ""mistake."" See Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co. v. Aniero Concrete Co., 404 F.3d 566 (2d Cir. 2005) (incorporating District Court opinion, 404 F.3d at 583 n.14 (S.D.N.Y. 1998))."
1604,102," Wilson does not contain an exposition of the facts. It appears that the case involved the defendant's mishandling of the 
plaintiff's request for a loan modification. Without ultimately resolving the question, the court stated, ""whether a lender owes a 
duty of care to a borrower depends on a balancing of several factors, including the extent to which the transaction was intended 
to affect the plaintiff, the foreseeability of harm, plaintiff's injury, the connection between the injury and defendant's conduct, 
moral blame attaching to defendant's conduct, and the policy of preventing future harm."" 2013 WL 1310589, at *5, 2013 U.S.

1605,105," A plaintiff who sold or bought a security (or the SEC) may certainly sue on the theory that suppression or inflation of an 
interest payment either suppressed or inflated the underlying security's price."

1606,107," In light of our jurisdictional conclusions, see supra at 95, we do not reach the question of whether plaintiffs have adequately 
alleged that the BBA committed fraud (either directly or on an aiding and abetting theory) by publishing LIBORs that integrated 
the panel banks' false submissions. "
1609,108," As a practical matter, plaintiffs' tortious interference claims add little value to this litigation. Because plaintiffs cannot prove 
tortious interference against one entity without proving a breach of contract claim against another entity, it is unlikely that the 
tortious interference claims will result in greater damages. Tortious interference is most valuable when a plaintiff's counterparty is 
judgment-proof or otherwise unsuable, unlikely scenarios here. Punitive damages are available (at least in some states), but are 
disfavored for the same reason that punitive damages are unavailable in contract. ""So long as the party subject to the breach is 
compensated to the extent of his loss, there is no reason to penalize the breaching party for refusing to perform his contractual 
obligations."" Dependahl v. Falstaff Brewing Corp., 653 F.2d 1208, 1217 (8th Cir. 1981); but cf. Cervecería Modelo, S.A. de C.V. 
v. USPA Accessories LLC, No. 07-cv-7998 (HB), 2008 WL 1710910, at *7, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 28999, at *20 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 
10, 2008) (suggesting that New York law permits punitive damages when ""tortious interference with contract was part of [*290]  
a practice directed at the public generally""). "
1619,109," In Blue Shield, for example, Blue Shield of Virginia covered patients' psychological services but (allegedly because of a 
conspiracy with psychiatrists) refused to reimburse patients for services that psychologists rendered and billed. The plaintiff, an 
insured of Blue Shield, wished to be reimbursed for her sessions with a psychologist. The plaintiff's inability to receive 
reimbursements was an immediate consequence of Blue Shield's boycott. No other cause intervened, and the harm plaintiff 
suffered was ""integral"" to the conspiracy even though it was not the conspiracy's alleged purpose. Blue Shield is distinguishable [*320]  from the LIBOR cases for another reason. Defendants in Blue Shield advanced the 
hypothetical that Blue Shield could have refused psychological reimbursements without a conspiracy, leaving plaintiff with the 
same injury as with a conspiracy. See 457 U.S. at 480 n.16. This hypothetical, while theoretically possible, is unpersuasive 
because an insurer has no strong independent reason to prefer psychiatrists over psychologists absent a conspiracy with the 
psychiatrists. Even though conspiracy was not a strict logical predicate, conspiracy was the leading (or perhaps the only) 
practical reason for plaintiff's injury. By contrast, the panel banks had compelling independent motivations to manipulate LIBOR. 
It is not that independent manipulation could have conceivably caused the same injuries that were allegedly caused in this 
instance by conspiracy, but that independent manipulation could have easily, realistically, and naturally caused the same 
injuries."
1619,110," The complaints under consideration in LIBOR I focused on suppression of LIBOR, but the second half of this comment holds 
true for LIBOR inflation as well: if [*322]  any bank was a net borrower of floating-rate products, then that bank had an incentive 
to inflate its submissions. "

whichever state's contract law results from the first question, whether the ISDA Agreement's precise language requires us to 
apply New York law [*339]  to all causes of action related to the contract, or only to claims for breach of contract. Third, if the "

would apply California statutory law to Wescorp's injury. Courts are divided on the first question, and we have found no Kansas

quotes without fear that a sudden increase will damage the bank's reputation for creditworthiness. "
1636,138," The British Parliament and Government have also acted. The intentional or reckless making of a false LIBOR quote is now a 
crime punishable by seven years' imprisonment. See Financial Services Act, 2012, c. 21, §§ 91-94 (U.K.) (defining the crime of 
""misleading statements etc in relation to benchmarks""); Financial Services Act 2012 (Misleading Statements and Impressions) 
Order, 2013, S.I. 2013/637, ¶ 3 (U.K.) (defining LIBOR as a ""relevant benchmark""). "
1637,139," So far, inter-bank conspiracy has been pleaded sufficiently only against Barclays and only in the context of trader-based 
manipulation. See supra at 111. "
1638,140," As an elaboration on this concept, suppose that one of the low-interest banks inflated its quote by 0.25% and the other by 
0.35%. The two would be jointly and severally responsible for the 0.03125% increase in LIBOR caused by their mutual 
increase [*377]  from 2.00% to 2.25%, but only the second bank would be responsible for the additional 0.0125% increase in 
LIBOR caused by its additional increase from 2.25% to 2.35%. This example highlights two points. First, that different sets of 
banks may be responsible for portions of LIBOR manipulation on a particular day. Second, that a bank whose submission was 
omitted from the BBA's calculation may, under some circumstances involving simultaneous manipulation by other banks, 
nevertheless be responsible for a portion of LIBOR manipulation. "
1639,141," Of course, a plaintiff that wins a judgment against each one may recover the full amount from either. "
1640,142," We express no view as to whether a counterparty that is liable under this theory for other panel banks' manipulation may seek 
contribution or indemnification from the panel banks. "
1642,143," Defendants have previously accepted that plaintiffs were not on inquiry notice of manipulation that occurred on August 6, 
2007. See LIBOR III, 27 F. Supp. 3d at 464 n.12. We have not decided precisely which August dates were within the scope of 
plaintiffs' inquiry notice, but we now think it fair to define Period One more precisely. The articles published in Spring 2008 
generally associated LIBOR's inaccuracy with the ""credit crunch"" or ""credit crisis."" See, e.g., Gavin Finch & Elliott Gotkine, Libor 
Banks Misstated Rates, Bond at Barclays Says, Bloomberg.com, May 29, 2008 (""Banks routinely misstated borrowing costs . . . 
to avoid the perception they faced difficulty raising funds as credit markets seized up.""); Carrick Mollenkamp, Bankers Cast 
Doubt on Key Rate amid Crisis, Wall St. J., Apr. 16, 2008. Accordingly, a reasonable investor would have investigated LIBOR 
manipulation that occurred during the ""credit crunch."" From the perspective of an investor in mid-2008, this started on August 9, 
2007, when overnight LIBOR spiked upward by over half a percent, and when severe illiquidity in subprime mortgage securities 
first forced central banks to offer emergency credit [*390]  to major banks. See Markus K. Brunnermeier, Deciphering the 
Liquidity and Credit Crunch 2007-2008, 23 J. Econ. Perspectives 77, 85 (Winter 2009) (describing timeline of credit crisis). "
1643,144," One declaration is from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's former executive director of interest-rate products. Barker Decl., 
ECF No. 873. Another is from a manager of one of the Amabile Plaintiffs, who considers himself and his firm to be ""highly 
sophisticated and knowledgeable in the various financial instruments the fund deals in,"" including Eurodollar futures. Rane Decl. 
¶ 4, ECF No. 874. The third is from an individual plaintiff who traded Eurodollar futures. Restani Decl., ECF No. 876."
1643,145," It is not clear whether banks' balance [*395]  sheets were, on net, positively or negatively affected by LIBOR suppression. 
Although banks lent money to some degree in adjustable-rate loans, it was well-known at the time that banks securitized many 
of these loans to pass the risk off to other investors. This point also misses that banks had enormous exposures to LIBOR 
through interest rate swaps and other derivatives. "
1644,146," This facilely conflates the ""trust"" that banks will pay back deposits with the ""trust"" that banks will tell the truth to the British 
Bankers' Association. A bank that is not trusted to pay back deposits will face a run. A bank that is not trusted to tell the truth to 
the BBA may face regulation and litigation, but not a run."
1644,147," In fact, as we have noted many times, LIBOR suppression did not depend on the existence of collusion. Nevertheless, the 
possibility of collusion was yet another reason for an investor to inquire."
1644,148," Surely sober, cogent denials would have been more convincing."
1644,149," This is as much a red flag as it is a comfort. As the 2008 articles suggested, the main problem with LIBOR was that the banks 
suppressed their LIBOR quotes in order to avoid appearing uncreditworthy. Scrutinizing outliers would only exacerbate [*396]  
the incentive for each bank to stay in the pack."
1644,150, Another red flag.
1644,151," The Principal Cases were transferred from the Southern District of Iowa, so we would normally apply Iowa's law alone. 
However, the Principal Plaintiffs filed amended complaints purporting to re-venue their cases in this Court, and so the parties 
have agreed to apply New York limitations law, including the borrowing rule, for [*397]  purposes of the present motions. 
Although we reject the Principal Plaintiffs' attempt to revenue their cases unilaterally, we conform our analysis to the parties' 
consensual acceptance of New York limitations law."
1644,152," Texas law applies to Houston. The parties agree that no time runs against Houston under Texas's implementation of the 
doctrine that nullum tempus occurrit reipublicæ (""no time runs against the sovereign""), so we do not consider Texas's statute of 
limitations further. The parties agree that the same doctrine applies in Philadelphia under Pennsylvania law to the common law 
claims brought by PICA (a state agency), but not to claims brought by Philadelphia."
1644,153," In particular, the parties appear to agree that California limitations law applies to claims filed in California by certain Schwab 
Plaintiffs that are organized and headquartered outside California. "
1646,154," The parties did not brief this issue, but this appears to be the crux of their competing analyses on, for example, page 59 of the 
Joint Limitations Spreadsheet. "
1647,155," Congress added this provision to the FDIC's extender statute in 1994. See Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching 
Efficiency Act of 1994, Pub. L. No. 103-328, 108 Stat. 2338. We have not identified any legislative history indicating why 
Congress chose to distinguish the NCUA from the FDIC and the RTC."
1647,156," The parties dispute whether the statute of limitations expired on negligent misrepresentation on behalf of Superior Bank and 
Lydian Private Bank, which were based in Alabama and Florida respectively. See infra at 406."
1647,157," As discussed supra at 228, the NCUA's private UCL claim is for restitution, and is therefore arguably akin to other unjust 
enrichment claims. However, the NCUA appears to concede that the extender statute's ""tort"" provision applies to its UCL claim. 
See Joint Limitations Spreadsheet at 59. "
1649,158," The statute governing the FDIC operates similarly. The FDIC may be a conservator, a receiver, or both in succession. 
However, it appears that each failed bank in this case went straight into receivership, so that the issue of successive 
appointments is only relevant to the NCUA."
1649,159," The Second Circuit also analogized to the Bankruptcy Code, pointing out that a Chapter 7 trustee has 60 days to assume or 
reject a debtor's executory contracts regardless of whether the same trustee previously acted as the debtor's Chapter 11 trustee. 
See 1185 Ave. of the Americas, 22 F.3d at 497-98. The Bankruptcy Code does not provide a useful analogy for the statute of 
limitations issue, because the statute of limitations found in the Bankruptcy Code does not depend on the date of a trustee's 
appointment. See 11 U.S.C. § 108(a)(2) (permitting a trustee or debtor-in-possession to commence an action within ""two years 
after the order for relief""). The Eighth Circuit in CedarMinn relied in part on Chevron deference (see CedarMinn, 956 F.2d at 1450-51 (citing Chevron, 
U.S.A., Inc. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, 467 U.S. 837, 842-43, 104 S. Ct. 2778, 81 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1984))—mistakenly, because 
the RTC was not the only federal agency responsible for administering FIRREA. See 1185 Ave. of the Americas, 22 F.3d at 497. 
Neither the NCUA nor the FDIC argues for Chevron deference in this case. "
1652,160," In analyzing the extender statutes, one might reasonably look to cases involving the government's general statute of 
limitations, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2415-16, because the extender statutes are in many ways akin to those sections. In this context, such 
reliance would not be appropriate, since these cases rely on the text of section 2416, which explicitly provides a discovery rule. 
However, Congress included no analogous provision in the extender statutes, so we instead rely on the federal common law rule 
of Koch and LIBOR I. "
1654,161," We defer to the D.C. Court of Appeals on matters of D.C. law. See Lee v. Flintkote Co., 593 F.2d 1275, 1278 n.14, 193 U.S. 
App. D.C. 121 (D.C. Cir. 1979). "
1657,162," At this stage, we decline defendants' invitation to push this date earlier to May 19, 2008. No significant revelation occurred on 
May 19, 2008, and defendants may have selected this apparently arbitrary date to defeat a portion of the claims that Prudential 
filed on May 19, 2014. See LIBOR I, 935 F. Supp. 2d at 700-04; Decl. of Matthew Porpora, ECF No. 768 (attaching more news 
articles). Although we agree with defendants that many articles regarding possible LIBOR manipulation had been published by 
May 19, we prefer [*432]  at the pleadings stage to place the date of inquiry notice at the end of the critical string of articles. This 
decision in no way forecloses a later finding that the date of inquiry notice was in fact earlier than May 29. "
1660,163," We use the phrase ""American Pipe tolling"" to refer specifically to the federal-law doctrine set forth in American Pipe & 
Construction Co. v. Utah, 414 U.S. 538, 94 S. Ct. 756, 38 L. Ed. 2d 713 (1974), and ""class-action tolling"" to refer to the concept 
more generally. "
1661,164," The Courts of Appeals disagree as to whether federal class-action tolling is available to a class member who files his 
separate case while the associated class action is still viable. Compare State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Boellstorff, 540 F.3d 
1223, 1228 (10th Cir. 2008) (applying class-action tolling under Colorado law), In re Hanford Nuclear Reservation Litig., 5c21 
F.3d 1028, 1038-39 (9th Cir.) (same, federal law), amended, 534 F.3d 986, 1008-09 (9th Cir. 2008), and In re WorldCom Sec. 
Litig., 496 Fc.3d 245, 254-56 (2d Cir. 2007) (same, federal law), with Wyser-Pratte Mgmt. Co. v. Telxon Corp., 413 F.3d 553, 
569 (6th Cir. 2005) (declining to apply class-action tolling under federal law), and Glater v. Eli Lilly & Co., 712 F.2d 735, 739 (1st 
Cir. 1983) (same, New Hampshire law). Defendants have not argued that any particular state would decline to follow the Second 
Circuit's well-reasoned holding that class-action tolling is available in such a circumstance. We note that none of the MDL cases 
with disputed limitations issues will be remanded to courts in the First or Sixth Circuit."
1661,165," Plaintiffs vigorously disagree with approach of following state law. Indeed, Chardon v. Fumero Soto, 462 U.S. 650, 103 S. Ct. 
2611, 77 L. Ed. 2d 74 (1983), indicates in dicta that a state must provide individual plaintiffs with some ""saving"" mechanism to 
vindicate the federal interest in encouraging class actions. Regardless of the merits of plaintiffs' argument, we are bound by 
Casey III to accept a state's total rejection of class-action tolling."
1661,166," Some parties have suggested certifying questions to the Connecticut and Iowa Supreme Courts, which permit certification 
from federal district courts. There is no need to do so because we can make appropriate Erie predictions, none of these issues is 
critical to this litigation as a whole, and none of these issues is so unlikely to arise in state-court litigation that certification is 
necessary to permit the state Supreme Courts to determine state law. "
1662,167," Defendants accept Staub, an intermediate appellate case, as a persuasive indicator of New Jersey law. Even if it were not, 
we would arrive at the same result for the reasons stated below. "
1663,168," We treat Second Circuit cases as binding precedent and out-of-circuit cases as persuasive precedent in this opinion, both for 
the formal reason that we sit within the Second Circuit and for the practical reason that this opinion is more likely to be reviewed 
by the Second Circuit than by any [*451]  other court. Nevertheless, because certain cases in this MDL might conceivably be 
remanded to California district courts and appealed to the Ninth Circuit, it bears noting that, although we decline to follow the 
reasoning of these Ninth Circuit cases, we do not believe that our result is ultimately any different than would be obtained by 
applying Hatfield's ""equitable tolling"" doctrine. "
1665,169," In point of fact, the only relevant non-resident plaintiffs are some of the Schwab plaintiffs. These entities barely benefit from 
class-action tolling, because tolling ended for them when they filed their first individual complaints in August 2011. "
1670,170, See supra at 43 for a discussion of the subsequent appellate history.
1670,171," See Compl., Charles Schwab, No. CGC-13-531016 (Cal. Super. Ct. S.F. Cty., Apr. 29, 2013), filed after removal and transfer 
as No. 13-cv-7005 (S.D.N.Y.), ECF No. 1, Ex. A. "
1671,172," We dismissed Baltimore in its entirety on the same date. However, because plaintiffs in that case successfully moved for 
reconsideration as to their state-law claims, we will permit tolling on the basis of Baltimore's state-law claims even after March 
29, 2013. Of course, claims against defendants dismissed in LIBOR III are not tolled following the date of that decision (June 23, 
2014)."
1671,173," We include in the following charts cases cited by the [*472]  Individual Plaintiffs in the spreadsheet submitted following oral 
argument. See ECF No. 1061-1. "
1672,174," To be clear, this and all other references to complaints in Metzler refers to the complaint in case number 11-cv-2613, formerly 
captioned as FTC Capital GmbH v. Credit Suisse Group AG. Plaintiffs do not rely for tolling on any complaint filed in Metzler 
Investment GmbH v. Credit Suisse Group AG, No. 11-cv-7676 (S.D.N.Y.), which has been consolidated with case number 11-
cv-2613. "
1697,175," Additionally, Rule 15(c)(1)(A) allows relation back when ""the law that provides the applicable statute of limitations allows 
relation back."" Plaintiffs do not argue that any relevant state law permits relation back when federal law otherwise does not."
1697,176," These included: Bank of America Corporation; Bank of America, N.A.; Barclays Bank PLC; Citigroup, Inc.; Citibank, N.A.; 
Credit Suisse Group AG; JPMorgan Chase & Co.; JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.; Lloyds Banking Group PLC; The Royal Bank of 
Scotland Group PLC; and UBS AG."
1697,177," Both complaints added Barclays Capital, Inc.; Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.; Credit Suisse AG; Credit Suisse International; 
Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC; Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.; JPMorgan Bank Dublin PLC; J.P. Morgan Securities, LLC; 
Lloyds Bank PLC; Merrill Lynch Capital Services, Inc. (a Bank of America affiliate); Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. 
(also a Bank of America affiliate); The Royal Bank of Scotland PLC; RBS Securities, Inc.; and UBS Securities LLC. Additionally, 
the Principal Financial Group Amended Complaint added Chase Bank USA, N.A. (a JPMorgan affiliate) and Credit Suisse 
International."
1697,178," Namely: Merrill Lynch Capital Services, Inc.; Barclays Bank PLC; Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC; Credit Suisse 
International; Chase Bank USA, N.A.; JPMorgan Bank Dublin PLC; The Royal Bank of Scotland PLC; and RBS Securities, Inc. 
Principal Fin. Grp. Am. Compl. P 203. "
1698,179," It remains unclear which security this referred to. The amended complaint lists Citigroup Global Markets Inc. as an 
underwriter or manager of dozens of securities."
1698,180," Additionally, the table at paragraph 141 lists four swaps by ID numbers and counterparties. We need not decide whether this 
table could have provided sufficient information to identify a security or contract because each listed counterparty was either 
named in the Original Complaint (Bank of America, N.A., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and UBS AG) or not named in the 
Amended Complaint (Morgan Stanley Capital Services)."
1698,181," In fact, the second amended complaint hedges by alleging that ""Credit Suisse Group AG and/or Credit Suisse AG was at all 
relevant times a member of the USD Libor panel."" "
1700,182," Although all plaintiffs appear to be Illinois residents, defendants do not rely on New York's borrowing rule at this stage. See 
Def. Master App., Ex. L, at 3. It appears that Illinois's limitations period is longer than New York's. "
1701,183," When a complaint refers to August 2007, we assume that the plaintiff intends the pleaded manipulation period to begin on 
August 9, 2007. No complaint provides data indicating that persistent suppression occurred before the 2007 credit crisis, and 
this aligns with our inquiry notice holding. "
1703,184, Such tolling does not apply to defendants not named in the original Gelboim complaint. 
1704,185," Although the complaint refers to ""at least August 2007 through at least the end of 2010"" as the ""Relevant Period,"" neither 
plaintiff alleges making any LIBOR-related payments or entering into any LIBOR-related swap agreements after 2010. "
1705,186," We agree with defendants that an unjust enrichment claim sounding in tort for monetary relief is governed by a three-year 
statute of limitations, at least to the extent that the unjust enrichment claim is not duplicative of a contract claim. See Ingrami v. 
Rovner, 45 A.D.3d 806, 808, 847 N.Y.S.2d 132, 134 (2d Dep't 2007)."
1705,187," Darby alleges that JPMorgan [*507]  Chase Bank, N.A. and Royal Bank of Scotland PLC are panel banks. If these allegations 
are correct, then it was a mistake for J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC to be named as a panel-
bank defendants in Metzler and other class actions. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Royal Bank of Scotland PLC plausibly had 
notice of the class actions and notice of the mistake, so (at least for purposes of this motion) classaction tolling applies to claims 
against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Royal Bank of Scotland PLC as though it had been named in each of the relevant 
class actions. "
1707,188," Washington Mutual was incorporated in Nevada and headquartered in Washington. The parties do not identify any relevant 
difference between Nevada and Washington law. "
1708,189," Kansas, home to Hillcrest, does not recognize class-action tolling, and Illinois, home to four failed banks, does not recognize 
cross-jurisdictional tolling. Ohio, home to AmTrust, does. The parties did not thoroughly brief the remaining home-state laws, so 
we assume for purposes of the present motion that each remaining state follows the federal practice. "
1709,190," IndyMac fell into receivership before August 5, 2008, so we interpret the FDIC's complaint to allege that the FDIC itself, in its 
capacity as receiver, relied on the BBA's August 5 statement."
1709,191," Alabama, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, Ohio, Puerto Rico, and Washington. "
1711,192," We agree with the FDIC that Colorado's limitations period for negligent misrepresentation runs for three years, pursuant to 
section 13-80-101(1)(c) of the Colorado Revised Statutes. "
1713,193," Superior, Community of Colorado, Lydian, Integra, and First National. "
1714,194," Those named in the original Metzler complaint: Bank of America Corp.; Barclays Bank PLC; Citibank, N.A.; Credit Suisse 
Group AG; Deutsche Bank AG; HSBC Holdings PLC; JPMorgan [*525]  Chase & Co.; Lloyds Banking Group PLC; the 
Norinchukin Bank; the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC; UBS AG; and WestLB AG (now Portigon AG)."
1714,195," Those named in the first amended Baltimore complaint, but not in the original Metzler complaint: Bank of America, N.A.; Bank 
of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd.; Citigroup Inc.; Coöperatieve Centrale Raiffeisen Boerenleenbank B.A.; HBOS PLC; HSBC Bank 
PLC; JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.; Royal Bank of Canada; and Westdeutsche ImmobilienBank AG."
1714,196," The NCUA brings only antitrust claims on behalf of Constitution. Defendants do not challenge these claims on grounds of 
timeliness. "
1715,197," Kansas applies a savings statute instead of class-action tolling, and Illinois, home to one of the failed credit unions, does not 
recognize cross-jurisdictional tolling. We have predicted that California would do so. As with the FDIC's claims, the parties did 
not thoroughly brief Texas law, so we have assumed for purposes of the present motion that Texas permits cross-jurisdictional 
tolling. But cf. Newby v. Enron Corp., 542 F.3d 463, 472 (5th Cir. 2008) (predicting that Texas would not recognize cross-
jurisdictional class-action tolling)."
1715,198," As with the FDIC complaint, we assume that each relevant state would accept a filing on Monday, April 30, 2012, that was 
timely on the previous Saturday, April 28, 2012. Therefore, we count limitations periods for Group B back from April 28, 2012. "
1716,199," Texas law would not bar claims arising before August 9, 2007, because the credit unions were not on inquiry notice of these 
claims. However, these claims are independently barred by Kansas's three-year limitations period, to which no discovery rule 
applies. "
1717,200," For purposes of this motion, we assume without deciding that the phrase ""debt security"" in both Gelboim complaints 
encompasses asset-backed securities. "
1719,201," The statute of limitations for an action to impose a constructive trust is six years. See   [*536] Congregation Yetev Lev 
D'Satmar, Inc. v. 26 Adar N.B. Corp., 192 A.D.2d 501, 503, 596 N.Y.S.2d 435, 437 (2d Dep't 1993). However, the constructive 
trust remedy is unavailable in New York when, as here, money damages are adequate. In that circumstance, a plaintiff may not 
""sidestep the statute of limitations"" by requesting a constructive trust instead of damages. Pons v. People's Rep. of China, 666 
F. Supp. 2d 406, 415 (S.D.N.Y. 2009)."
1719,202," We believe, but do not find, that this includes Bank of America Corp., Citibank, N.A., and JPMorgan Chase & Co. "
1720,203," Prudential alleges that Bank of America N.A., Citigroup Inc., HSBC Bank PLC, and Royal Bank of Scotland PLC were panel 
banks. If it was a mistake to name Bank of America Corp. and Citibank, N.A. in Carpenters Pension Fund and to name HSBC 
Holdings PLC and Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC in Ravan Investments and Insulators & Asbestos Workers, then class-
action tolling applies to claims against Bank of America N.A., Citigroup Inc., HSBC Bank PLC, and Royal Bank of Scotland PLC 
as if each had been named in the relevant class actions. "
1721,204," If, as Salix asserts, Credit Suisse AG was a panel bank rather than Credit Suisse Group AG, then it was a mistake for Credit 
Suisse Group AG to be named as a panel-bank defendant in Metzler and other class actions. Credit Suisse AG plausibly had 
notice of the class actions and notice of the mistake, so (at least for purposes of this motion) class-action [*541]  tolling applies 
to claims against Credit Suisse AG as though Credit Suisse AG had been named in each of the relevant class actions. This 
analysis applies equally to Bank of America, N.A., Citigroup Inc., and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. "
1722,205," Throughout this discussion, August 23 dates apply to the plaintiffs who filed on August 23, and August 27 dates apply to the 
plaintiffs [*543]  who filed on Monday, August 29. "
1724,206," The Clerk shall also dismiss Salix Capital Ltd. as a plaintiff, as that entity has assigned its claims to Salix Capital US Inc. "
1733,1," USS claims Checkpoint entered into agreements restraining trade in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act and Ohio 
Revised Code §§1331 et seq.; unlawfully monopolized and attempted to monopolize relevant markets in violation of Section 2 of 
the Sherman Act; and unreasonably restrained trade in violation of Section 3 of the Clayton Act. See second amended 
complaint, counts I-IV, VI (docket no. 139)."
1733,2," Specifically, the Special Master concludes the Court should: (1) grant USS's motion to bar Harris and Keeley from offering 
opinions that (a) the PeaceHealth test is inapplicable, (b) the predatory pricing test should be used instead, or (c) the predatory 
pricing test shows Checkpoint has not engaged in anticompetitive conduct; and (2) otherwise deny USS's motion. "
1735,3," Harris summarizes his conclusions at ¶¶173-174 of his report (quoted below). In its motion, USS only challenges the 
admissibility of the underlined conclusion; except to the extent discussed in this Report, USS does not directly seek to exclude 
Harris's other opinions."
1735,173," . In conclusion, I find that the relevant antitrust market is at least as broad as all EAS systems and likely also includes 
non-EAS [*10]  products. Dr. Shehadeh's alleged market of sales of RF EAS systems to F&D retailers ignores the decisions 
by many F&D retailers to use AM EAS or not to use any EAS system. I also find that Checkpoint is not a monopolist for RF 
EAS sales to F&D retailers."
1735,174," . I have also concluded that Dr. Shehadeh's and USS's foreclosure claims make no economic sense. Checkpoint's 
discounts do not violate the PeaceHealth cost test or a conventional predatory pricing test. Dr. Shehadeh has not shown 
that Checkpoint has exercised market power. Furthermore, Checkpoint's actions could not foreclose competition because 
USS and other competitors had ample opportunities to make sales other than to F&D retailers. There is no indication that 
USS is being foreclosed from the market or that competition has been harmed by Checkpoint's behavior. Harris report at 89-90 (underlining added). As for Keeley, his conclusions are summarized at ¶¶14-18 of his report, and USS 
objects to those opinions to the same extent as it objects to Harris's opinions, and also because they are cumulative. "
1736,4," HN7[
] To demonstrate attempted monopolization under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, ""a plaintiff must prove (1) that the defendant has engaged in predatory or anticompetitive conduct with (2) a specific intent to monopolize and (3) a dangerous 
probability of achieving monopoly power."" Spectrum Sports, Inc. v. McQuillan, 506 U.S. 447, 456, 113 S. Ct. 884, 122 L. Ed. 2d 
247 (1993). The PeaceHealth court examined only ""the first element of the Spectrum Sports test, the conduct element."" 
PeaceHealth, 515 F.3d at 894. Similarly, this Report focuses only on the parties' experts' opinions related to the conduct 
element. "
1737,5," More simply, if Acme sells widgets for less than it costs to produce them, it is engaging in exclusionary conduct. Shehadeh 
applies the term ""excess discount"" to describe the extent to which the effective discounted price of a product falls below its cost 
(or, saying the same thing a different way, the extent to which the amount of the discount exceeds profit margin). See, e.g., 
Shehadeh report ¶57 at 32 (""I observe a discount more than $1 million in excess of the gross margin earned on sales of 
competitive RF EAS accessories""); id. Fig. 7 at 33 (referring to this calculation as ""excess discount""). For example, if Acme's cost for producing a widget is $1.50, and it normally sells the widget for $3.00, but it offers a discount of 
$1.60, then: (1) the normal gross margin is $1.50 ($3.00 price minus $1.50 cost); (2) the $1.60 discount pushes the widget's 
effective discounted price to $1.40 ($3.00 price minus $1.60 discount); and (3) the ""excess discount"" is ten cents (the difference 
between the widget's $1.40 effective discounted [*17]  price and its $1.50 cost; which is also equal to the $1.60 discount amount 
minus the $1.50 normal gross margin). ""Excess discount"" is essentially a measure of the extent to which the discount is 
anticompetitive. "
1738,6," ""Of course, HN11[
] even if the exclusionary conduct element is satisfied by bundled discounts at price levels [*19]  that yield a conclusion of below-cost sales, under the appropriate measure, there cannot be Sherman Act §2 liability for attempted 
monopolization unless the other elements of a specific intent to monopolize and dangerous probability of success are satisfied."" 
PeaceHealth, 515 F.3d at 914 n.13."
1738,7," As noted, HN12[
] the PeaceHealth test for bundle discounts applies when the defendant sells a bundle of products (say, a 
widget and a gizmo) and the plaintiff sells fewer than all of those same products (say, only a widget). See PeaceHealth, 515 
F.3d at 907 (""To see whether a package price is 'exclusionary' . . . one simply attributes the entire discount on all products in the 
package to the product for which exclusion is claimed. If the resulting price is less than the defendant's cost, then the package 
discount is exclusionary as against a rival who makes only one of the two goods in the package."") (quoting 3 Antitrust Law 
¶749b2 at 335-36 (Supp. 2006) (emphasis added)). Thus, if plaintiff Bingo sells widgets and gizmos, just as defendant Acme 
does, then the test for whether Acme's bundle discount is anticompetitive is instead the predatory pricing test, which is applied to 
the entire bundle. See IIIA Antitrust Law ¶749d4 at 331-32 (3rd ed. 2008) (""if the market [*20]  contains at least one other 
significant firm [that] offers the same package that the defendant is discounting,"" then ""only a package that is sold at a price less 
than the cost of producing all items in the package can exclude""); id. ¶749d3 at 327 (this ""situation is adequately addressed 
under the law of predatory pricing""); id. ¶749d4 at 331 n.93 (citing Invacare Corp. v. Respironics, Inc., 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
77312, 2006 WL 3022968 (N.D. Ohio Oct. 23, 2006), for the proposition that a ""package discount [is] not unlawful when the 
plaintiff competitor produced all items in the package unless the defendant sold [the entire bundle] at prices below cost""). Returning to the example where Acme and Bingo each sell both widgets and gizmos, if (as reflected in Chart 1) Acme's costs for 
producing a widget and a gizmo are $1.50 and $2.50 respectively, and if Acme sells the widget-gizmo combination for $5.25 
(affording a bundle discount of $2.75 off the total price of $8.00 when sold separately), then the bundle discount is not 
anticompetitive because Acme's total bundle price of $5.25 still exceeds its total costs of $4.00 (or equivalently, Acme's $2.75 
bundle discount is less than its $4.00 total profit margin). Since Bingo also sells both widgets and gizmos, it can compete fairly 
with Acme on price; [*21]  whether Bingo can compete on price and also obtain a profit similar to Acme's depends on whether 
Bingo can be equally efficient (meaning, whether Bingo can produce widgets and gizmos at the same or lower costs as Acme). In this example, where Acme and Bingo each sell both widgets and gizmos, Acme's cost of producing a gizmo is relevant to the 
question of whether Acme's discount is anticompetitive. But if Bingo sells only widgets and not gizmos, then the PeaceHealth 
test applies instead of the predatory pricing test, and Acme's cost for producing gizmos does not enter into the calculation. 
HN13[
] PeaceHealth rejected a rule that ""condemns bundled discounts as anticompetitive only in the narrow cases in which 
the discounted price of the entire bundle [e.g., the widget-gizmo combination] does not exceed the bundling firm's incremental 
cost to produce the entire bundle."" PeaceHealth, 515 F.3d at 903. If Acme and/or Bingo also sell doodads, the analysis is essentially the same: HN14[
] PeaceHealth directs the court to group 
(a) the products on which the two companies compete and (b) the products on which they do not compete, and then to allocate 
the discount ""on the entire bundle of products to the [group of] competitive . . . products."" [*22]  Id. at 910. As discussed below, 
this is what Shehadeh did, grouping products as ""RF Hardware"" and ""RF Consumables."" A more difficult question is presented if 
a third company, Copa, sells only gizmos, so that, although neither Bingo nor Copa alone can match Acme's widget-gizmo 
bundle, the two Acme rivals could team up to make a similar offer. See IIIA Antitrust Law ¶749d4 at 332-33 (3rd ed. 2008) 
(discussing this circumstance). The parties do not raise this question directly. "
1739,8," The widget list price of $3.00 plus the gizmo list price of $5.10 yields a total list price of $8.10, when sold separately (column 3). 
The bundle discount, therefore, would be $2.85 (total list price of $8.10 minus the combination price of $5.25, column 5). Under 
the PeaceHealth test, this entire discount would be allocated to the $3.00 price of the widget, yielding a discounted price of 15 
cents (column 6). Since it costs Acme $1.50 to produce a widget, it is effectively selling the widget below cost, so the bundle 
discount is anticompetitive. The ""excess discount"" is $1.35 (the difference between the $0.15 effective discounted price and the 
$1.50 cost; or equivalently, the difference between the $2.85 bundle discount amount and the $1.50 widget profit margin)."
1739,9," The actual widget selling price of $3.00, plus the actual gizmo selling price of $5.00, yields a total selling price of $8.00, when 
sold separately (column 3). The bundle discount, therefore, [*25]  would be $2.75 (total selling price of $8.00 minus the 
combination price of $5.25, column 5). Under the PeaceHealth test, this entire discount would be allocated to the $3.00 price of 
the widget, yielding a discounted price of 25 cents (column 6). Since it costs Acme $1.50 to product a widget, it is effectively 
selling the widget below cost, so the bundle discount is anticompetitive. The ""excess discount"" is $1.25 (the difference between "
1740,," the $0.25 effective discounted price and the $1.50 cost; or equivalently, the difference between the $2.75 bundle discount 
amount and the $1.50 widget profit margin)."
1740,10," The actual volume-discounted widget selling price of $3.00, plus the actual volume-discounted gizmo selling price of $3.50, 
yields a total volume-discount selling price of $6.50, when sold separately (column 3). The bundle discount, therefore, would be 
$1.25 ($6.50 total volume-discounted selling price minus the combination price of $5.25, column 5). Under the PeaceHealth test, 
this entire discount would be allocated to the $3.00 price of the widget, yielding a discounted price of $1.75 (column 6). Since it 
costs Acme $1.50 to product a widget, it is effectively selling the widget at a [*26]  25-cent profit, so the bundle discount is not 
anticompetitive."
1740,11," As reflected in the three footnotes immediately above, Acme's bundle is anticompetitive if the bundle discount is measured 
using the gizmo's list price, or using the gizmo's actual sale price with no volume discount; but the bundle is not anticompetitive if 
the bundle discount is measured using the gizmo's actual sale price with volume discount."
1740,12," For examples of this situation, see: (1) PeaceHealth, 515 F.3d at 896-97 (quoting Ortho Diagnostic Sys. v. Abbott Lab., 920 
F. Supp. 455, 467 (S.D.N.Y.1996)), and (2) IIIA Antitrust Law ¶749d3 at 327 (3rd ed. 2008). A similar example is set out below

Acme also sells the widget-gizmo bundle under the terms ""buy both a widget and a gizmo, get the widget for $2.25 and the 
gizmo for $3.00 — a savings of $2.75!"" This yields a bundle price of $5.25 and a bundle profit of $1.25 (column 4). Allocating the 
entire bundle discount of $2.75 to Acme's widget price of $3.00 shows Acme is effectively selling its widget at 25 cents, or below 
its $1.50 cost (an ""excess discount"" of $1.25), failing the PeaceHealth test. This is true even though, given the way Acme prices 
its bundle, it is selling: (1) its widget above cost (price $2.25, cost $1.50); (2) its gizmo above cost (price $3.00, cost $2.50); and 
(3) its bundle above cost (price $5.25, cost $4.00). "
1743,," To compete against Acme's bundle price of $5.25, Bingo would have to sell its widget at 25 cents — because a gizmo sold 
separately by Acme costs $5.00 — which is less than Bingo's cost to produce a widget. Thus, Acme's bundle discount would 
force Bingo out of the widget [*29]  business, even though Bingo produces widgets more efficiently (that is, more cheaply) than 
Acme. Note that, to succeed under this scheme, Acme has no below-cost sales losses it would later need to recoup. Indeed, 
once Bingo goes out of business, Acme's profits will increase even if it simply reverts to its earlier prices of $3.00 for a widget 
and $5.00 for a gizmo (and not a supracompetitive widget price), because Acme will obtain all of the widget sales that once went 
to Bingo (assuming no other rivals)."
1743,13," Checkpoint's four largest customers were Albertsons, CVS, Rite Aid, and Walgreens, and the relevant time period is 2004-
2012. Checkpoint's ""list prices"" in Shehadeh's analysis were ""based on the 'Unit Standard Price' field in Checkpoint's Oracle 
transaction data."" Shehadeh report at 33 n.1. When calculating the ""total discount"" of $149.3M, [*32]  Shehadeh actually measured only the discount between list price and 
actual price for RF Hardware ($[TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT]M - $[TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT]M) — he did not 
determine list price for RF Consumables, so he did not include in the bundled discount any difference (either positive or 
negative) between list price and actual revenue ($[TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT]M) for RF Consumables. Shehadeh's 
calculation, then, may understate the extent of the bundle discount given by Checkpoint. Shehadeh did not calculate the total 
cost or profit on RF Hardware. "
1745,14," Shehadeh also undertook the same PeaceHealth test calculation using Checkpoint's ""catalog prices"" instead of its ""list prices,"" 
where catalog prices ""are based on the lowest volume-discounted catalog price in each year."" Shehadeh report at 33 n.8. 
Shehadeh determined that Checkpoint failed the PeaceHealth test using catalog prices, as well, yielding an ""excess discount"" of 
$43.9M. Shehadeh report at 33, figure 7. "
1747,15," USS argues the discounted prices received by Kohl's and Target are, in fact, also bundle prices, so Harris's reference point is 
false. Motion at 8 (docket no. 306)."
1747,16," Harris puts it this way: ""Whether or not a discount that induces customers to purchase a bundle is successful does not depend 
on list prices or the catalog prices that Albertsons, CVS, Rite [*43]  Aid or Walgreens would not likely pay even if the 
components of the bundle were sold separately. For example, if these buyers would have paid 40% of the list price (i.e., 60% off 
list) even if they purchased the 'non-competitive products' separately outside a bundle, then it is improper to include this full 60% 
discount off the list price as a discount associated with the bundle when employed in the PeaceHealth cost test. This 
inappropriate definition of the discount in conducting the PeaceHealth cost test overstates the discount used to induce the 
purchase of the bundle and can result in a finding that a bundle may be exclusionary when, in fact, the bundle is not 
exclusionary and actually falls into the PeaceHealth safe harbor."" Id. ¶116 at 58-59. "

pricing practices that might benefit consumers, absent the clearest showing that an injury to the competitive process will result.""); 
id. at 905 n.5 (""The frequency with which we see bundled discounts in varied contexts does not insulate such discounts from 
antitrust review, but it heightens the need to ensure that the rule adopted does not [*48]  expose inventive and legitimate forms 
of price competition to an overbroad liability standard."")."
1748,18," The PeaceHealth court observed that the standard it adopted would ""allow . . . difficult issues to further percolate in the lower 
courts."" Id. at 908. This Report falls squarely under the rubric of that legal percolation. "
1749,19," Professor Nalebuff echoes this thought. Under the topic of ""measuring price,"" he writes: ""Even when the monopolist lists 
separate prices for goods A and B as part of the bundle, these prices may not correspond to the true economic prices. The 
correct price to attribute to good B is how much more the customer would have to pay to buy both A and B from the monopolist 
compared to A alone."" Nalebuff, Exclusionary Bundling, 50 Antitrust Bull. at 329. Harris essentially argues that Checkpoint's ""true economic prices"" for Albertsons, CVS, Rite Aid, and Walgreens are not 
Checkpoint's list prices but the volume-discounted prices Checkpoint would give to any large consumer (such as Kohl's or 
Target). Thus, according to Harris, a bundle discount given to a large customer may include two species of price relief: (i) a 
volume discount available to any large customer, and (b) an additional discount given for buying a bundle of products. Harris 
argues Shehadeh should not include the former specie of price relief in his calculation of ""excess discount."""
1749,20," For example, in addition to arguing that Checkpoint's bundled discount should be measured against the volume-discounted 
prices Checkpoint would give to any large consumer, Harris also argues Shehadeh's list prices are inappropriately inflated: ""For 
both 2003 and 2004 Dr. Shehadeh identifies the maximum list price [of a specific deactivator] as being $1,174. Dr. Shehadeh's 
work product shows that [*51]  $1174 is an extraordinary high value that applies only to one small customer. * * * By contrast, 
data used by Dr. Shehadeh show that the highest list price [for the same deactivator] applicable to Albertsons was $[TEXT

Albertsons for this product by $[TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] or [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT]% in both 2003 
and 2004 . . . ."" Harris Report ¶121 at 63-64. "
1754,1," When ruling on a motion to dismiss, the Court accepts as true the factual allegations in the complaint. Hemi Grp., LLC v. City of

1755,2," Medytox employs different brand names for Meditoxin, including Siax, Cunox, Botulift, and Neuronox. (FAC ¶ 24.)"
1755,3, Plaintiffs also allege that Medytox obtained two other related U.S. patents during this same time frame. (Id. ¶ 33.) 
1758,4," The Court denies Allergan's request for judicial notice of any other documents not specifically discussed for the same reason 
that the Court denies Allergan's request for judicial notice of Document 32-8. "
1760,5," Allergan concedes that the final two factors — (4) risk of duplicative recovery, and (5) complexity in apportioning damages — 
""are not relevant [**23]  to Plaintiffs' claims."" (Mot. at 20.) "
1761,6," Plaintiffs also claim that ""Allergan's natural and plausible response to Medytox's threat of future entry would have resulted in 
Allergan reducing (i.e. limiting) its own monopoly prices for Botox well before Medytox could enter the U.S. market so as to make 
it unprofitable for Medytox to continue . . . to [try to] gain entry into the U.S. market."" (Opp'n at 4.) According to Plaintiffs, ""[t]hese 
lower 'limit prices' that would have been charged by Allergan for its own Botox product even before Medytox's entry would have 
benefitted Plaintiffs and the Class."" (Id. at 4.) However, while Plaintiffs cite a variety of authorities to support their argument that 
the economic concept of limit pricing exists, Plaintiffs do not cite any authority, and the Court knows of none, for the proposition 
that a defendant can be found to have violated the antitrust laws by failing to engage in limit pricing, which [**28]  itself has been 
found to violate the antitrust laws. (See generally Opp'n at 18-26.) Plaintiffs seem to confound the concepts of price competition, 
which the antitrust laws were designed to protect, with limit pricing, a practice that in certain circumstances violates the antitrust 
laws. Therefore, the Court rejects this alternative, albeit creative, theory."
1761,7," The cases that Allergan cites in support of its ""intent and preparedness"" arguments all relate to competitor antitrust standing, 
rather than customer antitrust standing. Nevertheless, the Court finds that Allergan's arguments regarding ""intent and 
preparedness"" are relevant to Plaintiffs' claims because if Plaintiffs have failed to allege adequately Medytox's ""intent and 
preparedness"" to enter the United States market, the second and third factors courts consider when determining whether a 
plaintiff has plead adequately antitrust standing would weigh in favor of dismissal for failure to plead adequately antitrust [**30]  
standing. See Glen Holly, 352 F.3d at 378 (""If the antitrust laws are designed to protect customers from the harm of unlawfully 
elevated prices, and from agreements between competitors at the same level of the market structure to allocate territories in 
order to minimize competition, it is no stretch to conclude that these same laws protect customers from harm directly related to 
the unlawful removal of a competitive product from the market."") (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). "
1763,8," Allergan also relies extensively on Cyntegra, Inc. v. IDEXX Labs., Inc., 322 F. App'x 569 (9th Cir. 2009) and Ethypharm S.A. 
France v. Abbott Labs., 707 F.3d 223 (3d Cir. 2013) in its pleadings, and specifically highlighted these cases at oral argument, in 
support of its argument that Plaintiffs lack antitrust standing. These cases, however, were decided at the summary judgment 
stage. Thus, at the motion to dismiss stage, where the Court must take as true the allegations included in the FAC, the Court 
finds that Cyntegra and Ethypharm [**38]  are of limited applicability. "
1765,9," The Court also rejects Allergan's request that the FAC's prayer for injunctive relief [**43]  ""should be dismissed both because 
Plaintiffs fail to allege injury or causation and because Plaintiffs fail to allege any of the requirements for an injunction."" (Mot. at

14-cv-3116."
1783,3," The Court refers to and incorporates by reference its prior decisions, which provide a thorough overview of the procedural 
history and factual allegations at issue in this action. In particular, the Court refers to its prior decision addressing the bulk of 
defendants' motions to dismiss the TAC. See In re Aluminum Warehousing Antitrust Litig. (""In re Aluminum""), No. 13-md-2481 
(KBF), 95 F. Supp. 3d 419, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 38743, 2015 WL 1378946 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2015). The Court here only 
provides background to the extent necessary to decide the pending motion. [*26] "
1784,4," Thus, for purposes of defendants' Rule 12(b)(6) argument, the Court does not consider the July 10, 2015 Declaration of Robert 
Burgess-Allen (""Burgess-Allen Decl."") or Exhibits 1, 2, 5, 8, and 10-20 of the August 28, 2015 Declaration of Linda P. Nussbaum 
(""Nussbaum Decl.""). The Court may, however, consider Exhibits 3, 4, 6, 7, and 9 of the Nussbaum Declaration, as these 
documents are incorporated by reference into the TAC. (See TAC ¶¶ 252, 256, 520, 607.) "
1785,5," The TAC alleges that other conspirators in the overall scheme included affiliates of Goldman, JPMorgan Chase & Co. 
(""JPMorgan""), and Glencore plc (""Glencore""). (TAC ¶¶ 85-127.)"
1785,6," In March 2010, Burgess-Allen and Wibbelman had also communicated by email about arranging a ""formal presentation to 
[Goldman] regarding merits of Detroit rental deal"" and a ""discussion about formal way to recoup potential premiums that are 
available in future agreed sales via break fees with Financiers."" (TAC ¶ 607; Nussbaum Decl., Ex. 7.)"
1785,7," In his communications with Wibbelman and other Metro employees, Burgess-Allen often used the collective ""we"", ""us"", or ""our"" 
when referring to Metro's point of view. (E.g., Nussbaum Decl., Ex. 3 (""Glencore is not our future for supplying metal""); 
Nussbaum Decl., Ex. 4 (May 24, 2011 email to Wibbelman in which Burgess-Allen wrote ""I am ever concerned the big picture is 
being missed here — if we want to sell premium we have to almost act as physical [*35]  traders. We are in effect gaining 
premium on something we are not technically entitled to. If we don't want to sell and want to contango finance without paying a 
$20 fee — this is possible but it will take us 18 months to break even.""); Nussbaum Decl., Ex. 7 (March 21, 2010 email to 
Wibbelman in which Burgess-Allen says ""Unless we see a change in this picture we are probably safe to keep rolling in this 
manner.""); Nussbaum Decl., Ex. 18 (March 2010 email from Burgess-Allen to Alyssa Abend of Metro stating, ""Please find "
1786,," attached details of the rental pay up that we have arranged with Natixis."" The ""pay up"" involves banks in Mobile, Long Beach 
and Toledo as well as a number of international locations.).)"
1786,8," In addition to communications regarding deals between Metro and outside parties, plaintiffs also present evidence that 
Burgess-Allen was involved in communications with Wibbelman and other Metro employees that expressly referenced activity in 
the United States. (E.g., Nussbaum Decl., Ex. 16 (April 2011 email from Wibbelman to Burgess-Allen in which Wibbelman stated 
""Increase incentive level to get 200K additional new metal into Detroit.""); Nussbaum Decl., Ex. 19 (September 2011 emails from 
Metro employees to Burgess-Allen asking, ""Rob any update on what we can move to Detroit and when?,"" and ""When do you 
think first metal can start moving out to Detroit?"").)"
1786,9," Plaintiffs also offer a May 2012 email that Burgess-Allen sent to a Wells Fargo employee—copying Whelan and Wibbelman—in 
which the participants [*39]  discuss a potential aluminum transaction. Burgess-Allen suggested that he and the Wells Fargo 
employee had previously met in the United States. (Nussbaum Decl., Ex. 5 (""I hope you are well — time has passed so quickly 
since we met in Charlotte!!"").) While this email exchange suggests that Burgess-Allen traveled to the United States for business-
related purposes, there is no indication on the face of this email chain that his travel was related to the planning or 
implementation of the ""smart ass plan."" "
1787,10," New York's long-arm statute could also potentially serve as another basis for personal jurisdiction. Pursuant to that statute, a 
court may exercise personal jurisdiction over any non-domiciliary who ""commits a tortious act without the state causing injury to 
a person or property within the state . . . if he expects or should reasonably expect the act to have consequences in the state 
and derives substantial revenue from interstate or international commerce."" N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 302(a). Plaintiffs concede that ""due 
process requirements to establish jurisdiction under New York's long-arm statute are identical to those under a Rule 4(k)(2) 
analysis."" (Opp. Br. 24 n.17.) The Court therefore does not separately address whether plaintiffs have satisfied the requirements 
for jurisdiction under New York's long-arm statute, but notes that it believes such analysis would not, in any event, alter the result 
as to either of the BAP Defendants. "
1788,11," The only theory of specific jurisdiction that plaintiffs rely on is that the BAP Defendants' foreign conduct had effects within the 
United States. Thus, this is the only basis for specific jurisdiction considered by the Court. "
1792,12," The Court notes that even if it could properly exercise of personal jurisdiction over BAP, the Court would nonetheless dismiss 
plaintiffs' claims against it on the ground that the TAC does not sufficiently allege BAP's involvement in the conspiracy. "
1793,13," The Court rejects Burgess Allen's analogy to In re Terrorist Attacks on Sept. 11, in which the Second Circuit concluded that 
personal jurisdiction was lacking over four Saudi Arabian princes who donated funds to third-party charities they allegedly knew 
would pass on those funds to Al Qaeda, which would foreseeably use those funds to attack targets in the United States. See 538 
F.3d at 95. In contrast to the defendants in that case, the record here suggests that Burgess-Allen had a far less attenuated 
connection to the alleged unlawful conduct as plaintiffs allege that he actually formulated the anticompetitive agreement. 
Furthermore, plaintiffs' evidence shows that Burgess-Allen took direct action in [*61]  furtherance of the scheme and clearly 
understood that his conduct would have significant effects within the United States."
1793,14," At the outset, the Court notes that the parties' respective invocations of the law of the case doctrine are misplaced. See 
Rezzonico v. H & R Block, Inc., 182 F.3d 144, 148 (2d Cir. 1999) (""As most commonly defined, the doctrine of law of the case 
posits that when a court decides upon a rule of law, that decision should generally continue to govern the same issues in 
subsequent stages in the same case."" (alterations omitted)). On the one hand, plaintiffs seek to rely on this Court's prior ruling 
that the TAC satisfies the separate entity requirement by alleging a web of agreements or understandings between Metro and 
the Goldman Sachs entities and the JPMorgan entities, Henry Bath LLC, the Glencore entities and Pacorini. In re Aluminum, 
2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 38743, 2015 WL 1378946, at *17. That ruling, however, did not purport to apply to Burgess-Allen, who 
had not yet been served with the TAC, made an appearance in this action, or moved to dismiss the TAC. The BAP Defendants, 
in turn, rely on this Court's prior statement that ""BAP and Burgess-Allen are alleged to have not had any independent economic 
role in the conspiracy beyond that which it undertook while working on behalf of Metro."" Id. [*64]  While the Court ultimately 
concludes that the statement remains accurate, the Court does not make that determination based on that prior statement. That 
prior statement did not purport to be a definitive ruling on the sufficiency of the allegations of Burgess-Allen's role in the "
1794,," conspiracy and it was made without the benefit of any briefing directed to the question of the viability of the § 1 claim as to him. 
The Court thus does not view either of its prior statements as dispositive of the BAP Defendants' motion."
1794,15," Plaintiffs make much of their contention that Burgess-Allen formed BAP and conceived of the ""smart ass plan"" prior to entering 
into a service agreement with Metro in December 2010, but the Court does not find this allegation to be material to Burgess-
Allen's capacity to conspire. It does nothing to alter the allegations of the nature, scope or economic realities of the agency 
relationship [*66]  between Burgess-Allen and Metro that existed prior to the execution of the agreement."
1794,16," Burgess-Allen's shared interest with Metro is further supported by his repeated use of the collective ""we"" when referring to 
Metro's point of view in communications to Metro employees, in those communications incorporated by reference into (or cited 
by) the TAC. (E.g., Nussbaum Decl., Ex. 3 (""Glencore is not our future for supplying metal""); Nussbaum Decl., Ex. 4 (May 24, 
2011 email to Wibbelman in which Burgess-Allen wrote ""I am ever concerned the big picture is being missed here - if we want to 
sell premium we have to almost act as physical traders. We are in effect gaining premium on something we are not technically 
entitled to. If we don't want to sell and want to contango finance without paying a $20 fee - this is possible but it will take us 18 
months to break [*69]  even.""); Nussbaum Decl., Ex. 7 (March 21, 2010 email to Wibbelman in which Burgess-Allen says 
""Unless we see a change in this picture we are probably safe to keep rolling in this manner."").) "
1795,17," The Court notes that the principal-agent relationship at issue in Fuchs—that of a vertical producer/reseller—was different in 
kind from the planner and negotiator/service provider relationship alleged here. It is thus uncertain the extent to which the Fuchs 
factors should govern. But, to the extent these factors provide a guideline as to where the relevant lines should be drawn, they 
support a finding that Burgess-Allen was not an ""independent center[] of decision-making"" such that he would constitute an 
entity separate from Metro for purposes of § 1. Am. Needle, 560 U.S. at 196."
1795,18," It cannot be the case that Copperweld bars a § 1 claim only when the agent acts solely for the benefit of the principal in 
situations in which he lacks his own, aligned selfish motivation. Bill's Birds, 920 F. Supp. 2d at 365 (finding that licensing agent 
was not an independent, separate economic entity where evidence showed that it acted consistently to further the interests of its 
principal). The conclusory allegation that Burgess-Allen received compensation when Metro also benefitted is not itself sufficient 
to find that Burgess-Allen was a separate economic actor in the conspiracy. See Okusami v. Psychiatric Inst. of Washington, 
Inc., 959 F.2d 1062, 1065, 295 U.S. App. D.C. 58 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (finding lack of capacity to conspire where there was no 
allegation that individual defendant had economic interest independent of corporate defendants and allegations suggested 
individual's interests were ""in harmony"" with corporate defendants). "
1796,19," The Court notes that even if it could properly consider all of the extra-pleading materials submitted by the parties in resolving 
the 12(b)(6) component of defendants' motion, the Court would still conclude that plaintiffs have not plausibly shown that 
Burgess-Allen entered [*76]  into an agreement with a third party entity unaffiliated with Metro. Thus, any amendment to the TAC 
to incorporate the additional documents included in the Nussbaum Declaration would be futile. "
1797,20," The Court assumes that despite the dismissal of Burgess-Allen and BAP, plaintiffs will nonetheless [*77]  seek discovery 
against them. The Court notes that it would be surprising, in light of defendants' argument (and the Court's determination) that 
Burgess-Allen was acting as an agent of Metro, if Metro lacked all access to relevant material in Burgess-Allen's possession. "

1857,11," Celgene also argues that [*42]  the Court may use Fed. R. Evid. 201(b) to take judicial notice of the Non-Distribution Patents

adjudicative fact ""that is not subject to dispute because it is (1) generally known within the trial court's territorial jurisdiction; or (2) 
can be accurately and readily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned."" The Court may take 
judicial notice of the fact that Celgene's Non-Distribution Patents are listed in the Orange Book as a matter of public record, see 
Schmidt v. Skolas, 770 F.3d 241, 249 (3d Cir. 2014), but cannot deem the listings as proof of their validity when the FDA admits 
that it does not review the patent information submitted as part of an NDA. See King Drug Co. of Florence, Inc. v. Smithkline

Banner assets."" That Order also noted that Procaps ""never gave Patheon its blessing to bring in Banner."" [ECF No. 565]. "

data, he has not carried his burden to demonstrate that the restrictions have a net anticompetitive effect""). "
1884,11," Referred to hereafter as ""IFD"" or ""Indiana Federation."""
1884,12," In IFD, the Supreme Court commented about the FTC's finding that individual dentists would have been subject to market 
forces of competition, creating incentives for them to comply with the requests of their patients' third-party insurers in the 
absence of concerted behavior: it noted that the finding ""finds support not only in common sense and economic theory, upon 
both of which the FTC may reasonably rely, but also in record documents[.]"" 476 U.S. at 456."

alternatively consider actual effects (i.e., the x ray output). IFD, 476 U.S. at 460-61. The same is true in Realcomp, where the 
court found the restraint was similar to that in IFD, and therefore ""likely enough"" [**48]  to disrupt the competitive process, but 
still separately analyzed whether the restraint resulted in actual adverse effects. 635 F.3d at 828, 832-34. "
1887,15," In his deposition, Blair was asked about ""the seven-month period where it's alleged that the Banner assets were out of the 
market."" He was asked if he was ""aware of [**54]  any deals in the relevant market that were actually negotiated to conclusion in 
that seven-month period,"" and he said, ""not specifically, no."" Later in the deposition, he was asked if ""there would have been an 
actual adverse effect in the seven months if no contracts were signed in that seven-month period of time."" His answer: ""not 
necessarily, no."""
1887,16," The Undersigned required [ECF No. 778] the parties to submit their suggested protocol for the rule of reason analysis if they 
could not agree on a methodology. The parties could not agree, and each submitted a comprehensive memorandum on the 
suggested legal framework. [See ECF Nos. 822 (Procaps' submission); 823 (Patheon's submission)]. "
1888,17," They show theoretical price and output effects, not actual ones. Indeed, the graphs are ""illustrative"" only, contain no numbers, 
and are ""not drawn to scale."" [See Ex. 71, ¶¶ 49-56]. In Spanish Broadcasting, the Eleventh Circuit explained how evidence that behavior was ""likely to harm competition"" is relevant 
in a Prong 2 ""potential effects"" case once market power has been established. 376 F.3d at 1072-74 and n.9. But this is not a 
prong 2 case. "
1891,18," Procaps has not been completely eliminated as a competitor. It concedes its efforts to compete and acknowledges its success 
to date (i.e., $306,000.00). And Patheon contends that Procaps is actually involved in millions of dollars in additional contracts (a 
point Procaps disputes, but not because the contracts do not exist)."
1891,19," See also Craftsmen, where the court granted summary judgment because plaintiff lacked evidence of ""actual, sustained 
adverse effects on competition of the type hypothesized."" 491 F.3d at 391."
1891,20," Procaps argues that horizontal mergers are distinct from horizontal market allocations because they do not necessarily 
eliminate capacity [ECF No. 931, p. 23 n.9], but offers no authority [**70]  for the proposition that all mergers are unlawful if they 
eliminate capacity. "
1894,21," This quoted sentence and the section of the analysis in Levine clearly relate to a market power/potential effects analysis, but 
there is no reason to believe that the potential effects of market power analysis in a Prong 2 approach (i.e., are they 
substantial?) would be governed by a standard different than the one used in an actual detrimental effects analysis in a Prong 1 
actual effects assessment. While the type of proof may differ for each, a Court in each instance is trying to address the same 
question: whether the alleged restraint is unreasonable under the Sherman Act. See Standard Oil Co. v. United States, 221 U.S. 
1, 31 S. Ct. 502, 55 L. Ed. 619 (1911). "
1897,22," Procaps' claim (in its opposition memorandum) [**88]  that, in Adaptive Power, the ""number of suppliers remained the same"" 
[ECF No. 931, p. 30], is incorrect because the court there assumed a ""temporary decline in the number of competitors."" 141 F.3d 
at 952. If anything, removing the competitor in Adaptive Power would have been more severe in that case because there were 
fewer competitors (3) than here (9+). In any event, the Court held that ""any harmful effect on competition"" was ""at most, 
temporary."" It also explained that ""a temporary decline in the number of competitors"" is ""not significant enough to be classified 
as an injury to competition under the Sherman Act. Id. Adaptive Power is also helpful to Patheon on another point. It held that ""just as a temporary decline in the number of 
competitors is not a significant restraint of trade, neither is a related temporary decline in quantity, quality or efficiency."" Id. 
(emphasis added)."
1897,23," Procaps contractually agreed that Patheon had six months to incorporate newly acquired assets and admits the Collaboration 
(which contained this six month incorporation period) was procompetitive at the time of its execution. Thus, Patheon argues that 
it logically follows that Patheon's offering of new opportunities to Procaps during this six-month period is also procompetitive. "

Patheon distinguishes McWane on the ground that it is an inapplicable FTC enforcement action under Section 5 of the FTC Act 
and that the Eleventh Circuit's review is more deferential than a de novo review of a district court's legal rulings in a Sherman Act 
case. [ECF No. 992-1, p. 31]. Schering-Plough is also an FTC case. "
1900,26," A Westlaw search of Levine run on October 20, 2015 reveals that Levine has 744 citing references. Of those, only 2 are listed 
as having given negative treatment. Those two cases are both non-binding district court opinions which do not actually criticize 
the applicable Levine rule being discussed here. Alabama Ambulance Service, Inc. v. City of Phenix City, Ala., 71 F. Supp. 2d

Inc., v. Decosta, 587 F.3d 1280 (11th Cir. 2009). "
1901,27," Iconic singer/songwriter Bob Dylan musically discussed this type of situation in his ""Gotta Serve Somebody"" song (on the Slow 
Train Coming album, Columbia Records, 1979). The following lyrics, which place an individual's status in the universe in context, 
could easily apply to the legal universe -- i.e., a federal magistrate judge handling a case by consent who is asked to disregard 
language which the binding appellate court has often used and which has not been expressly reversed: ""You may be [**102]  a 
state trooper, you might be a young Turk / You may be the head of some big TV network / You may be rich or poor, you may be 
blind or lame / You may be living in another country under another name / But you're gonna have to serve somebody, yes you

1903,30," ""Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization."" "
1906,31," The Undersigned recognizes that this is not a market power case. But for purposes of discussing this specific point (and thus 
clarifying the meaning of the required antitrust injury), it is helpful to use specific figures for a general demonstration. In an actual 
effects case, such as the one here, the Undersigned does not have the benefit of such a clear mathematical demonstration. This 
absence of specificity further exemplifies why it is imperative for each matter to face a rigorous case-by-case determination 
dependent on the unique circumstances of each injury and restraint alleged."
1906,32, More on that dispute over a dispute below.
1906,33," Untracht v. Fikri, 454 F. Supp. 2d 289, 310 (W.D. Pa. 2006), which it cited for the proposition that ""voluntary foreclosure of 
one's own opportunities for competition is not the type of antitrust injury for which the antitrust laws were designed to provide 
redress"", and McDonald v. Johnson & Johnson, 722 F.2d 1370, 1374 (8th Cir. 1983), which it summarized in a parenthetical 
as standing for the rule that ""no antitrust standing when plaintiff voluntarily withdraws from the market."" "
1907,34," Patheon's proposed order [ECF No. 992-1, p. 40] also cites NicSand, Inc. v 3M Co., 507 F.3d 442, 447-49 (6th Cir. 2007) (en 
banc) and El Aguila Food Prods., Inc. v. Gruma Corp, 301 F.Supp.2d 612, 621 (S.D. Tex. 2003). It relied on NicSand because 
the court found no antitrust injury because plaintiff ""had every opportunity to compete and yet it failed to do so."" And it cited El 
Aguila Food because the court described plaintiff's evidence as ""suffer[ing] from a self-inflicted wound"" after the plaintiff refused 
on principle to negotiate with retailers for shelf space."
1907,35," In its response [ECF No. 931, pp. 7-8] to Patheon's summary judgment motion, Procaps challenges Patheon's description of 
footnote 9 as being undisputed, saying ""Procaps never seriously contemplated building a new softgel plant in the United States."""
1907,36," If the Court were denying Patheon's summary judgment motion on all grounds and if the case were to proceed to trial, then 
Procaps would likely encounter great difficulty in establishing antitrust [**125]  injury (because of its continued participation as a 
competitor and evidence suggesting it deliberately chose not to pursue opportunities). But this hypothetical difficulty is not 
sufficient to justify a defense summary judgment on Patheon's failure-to-establish-antitrust-injury argument. [See ECF No. 565, 
p. 39]. "
1918,1," We have omitted any internal quotation marks, alterations, emphasis, or citations here and throughout this opinion, unless 
otherwise noted. "
1929,2," SawStop also argued that the complaint alleged sufficient direct evidence of a conspiracy to avoid dismissal. See Robertson, 
679 F.3d at 289 (holding that a complaint can state a § 1 claim if it alleges ""direct evidence"" of the agreement itself); but see Am. 
Chiropractic Ass'n v. Trigon Healthcare, Inc., 367 F.3d 212, 226 (4th Cir. 2004) (indicating that ""smoking gun"" direct evidence is 
""extremely rare in antitrust cases""). As SawStop's complaint meets ""Twombly's requirements with respect to allegations of illegal 
parallel conduct,"" Robertson, 679 F.3d at 290, we need not determine whether SawStop has adequately alleged direct evidence. "
1931,3," Many of the same allegations that carry SawStop's complaint past a motion to dismiss -- the ""who, [**46]  what, when, and 
where"" -- may substantially focus the discovery in a way that was not possible in Twombly. See id. at 560 n.6 (noting the 
difficulty and expense of discovery directed toward ""some illegal agreement"" ""between unspecific persons"" ""at some point over 
seven years.""). "
1944,1," In making this point, the majority credits scraps of testimony from David Peot cherry-picked by SD3 while it ignores the district 
court's diligent review of the full trial transcript. Ante at 37. When read in full, Peot's testimony focused on defendants' joint 
venture, formed years after the alleged group boycott. J.A. 134-40. Far from revealing a collective refusal to deal, Peot clarified 
that defendants planned ""to use whatever technology we felt would be best to prevent table saw accidents. There were no 
limitations that I can remember one way or the other."" J.A. 140. This discrepancy is emblematic of plaintiffs' attempt to conjure a 
conspiracy and of the majority's willingness [**97]  to overlook the holes in the narrative. "
1945,2," I thus concur in Part VI of the majority opinion dismissing SD3's challenge to the actions of the standard-setting organization, 
Underwriters Laboratories, [**101]  Inc. (UL). I also concur in Part III rejecting SD3's claims against a number of defendants 
simply lumped into a conspiracy through nothing more than conclusory allegations. "

LEXIS 43286, 2015 WL 1475996, at *8 (C.D. Cal. Mar. 30, 2015). "
1972,1," Defendant HCA Holdings, Inc. represents that it is a different entity than HCA, Inc. and was not a defendant in Fox I. Mot. at 3 
n.1. However, Defendant does not explain the relationship between the two companies or request judicial notice of documents 
reflecting that relationship. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant owned GSH when GSH revoked Plaintiff's privileges, and thus 
apparently alleges that Defendant and HCA, Inc. are the same company. FAC ¶ 11-12. For the purposes of a motion to dismiss, 
the Court accepts Plaintiff's allegations as true. See Manzarek v. St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co., 519 F.3d 1025, 1031 (9th Cir. 
2008). "
1973,2," For the purposes of this motion, Plaintiff stipulated to the statement of relevant facts set out in Defendant's motion to dismiss. 
See Opp. at 2. "
1979,3," Defendant, in a footnote in the opening brief, also contends that Plaintiff fails to allege a ""pattern,"" an ""enterprise,"" and RICO 
standing. Mot. at 8 n.3. However, Defendant provides no elaboration or argument on these RICO elements until the reply brief. 
This Court only considers issues that are ""argued specifically and distinctly in a party's opening brief."" See Gale v. NEC Corp., 
No. C 06-3237JF, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24859, 2007 WL 915384, at *1 n.6 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 23, 2007) (citing Indep. Towers of 
Wash., 350 F.3d at 929). A bare assertion of an issue does not preserve a claim. Id. (citing Indep. Towers of Wash., 350 F.3d at 
929). Accordingly, the Court does not consider the sufficiency of Plaintiff's allegations regarding RICO standing and the elements 
of a RICO claim mentioned only in Defendant's footnote in the opening brief. "
1982,1," By order filed October 13, 2015, the Court took the matters under submission. "
1984,2," StubHub alleges the relevant geographic area is the ""Bay Area"" (see FAC ¶ 85), which it alternatively describes as ""the San 
Francisco - Oakland - Fremont Metropolitan Statistical Area"" (see FAC ¶¶ 89, 99.) Defendants have not argued that plaintiffs' 
allegation of a ""Bay Area"" market is insufficient to allege a geographic market. "
1986,3," In light of the Court's [*13]  finding as to StubHub's failure to allege a cognizable product market, the Court does not reach the 
additional arguments made by defendants with respect to the Sherman Act claims."
1986,4," If StubHub files a Second Amended Complaint, it may, but is not required to, amend the Seventh and Eighth Claims. "
1989,1," Because the Second Amended Complaint refers to the Agreement (which is attached to both parties' briefs), and because the 
Agreement is central to Mr. Blackford's claims, the Agreement is properly considered by the Court. Wright v. Associated Ins. 
Companies Inc., 29 F.3d 1244, 1248 (7th Cir. 1994)."
1989,2," The check (attached to both parties' briefs) is also referenced in, and is central to, the Second Amended Complaint, and is also 
therefore properly considered by the Court. Wright, 29 F.3d at 1248. "
1990,3," Mr. Blackford requests another opportunity to amend his complaint if the Court finds that the Second Amended Complaint fails 
to state a RICO claim. [Filing No. 41 at 10.] As an initial matter, motions must be filed separately from briefs unless ordered by 
the Court. S.D. Ind. Local Rule 7-1(a). Even though leave to amend should [*7]  be freely granted ""when justice so requires,"" 
Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2), the right to amend as a matter of course is limited to ""force the pleader to consider carefully"" whether 
and how the plaintiff wishes to amend the complaint, Fed. R. Civ. P. 15 Advisory Committee Notes. Moreover, denial of a motion 
for leave to amend for a third time would be well within the Court's discretion—especially where, as here, the plaintiff seeks to 
amend on the basis of publicly available information. See, e.g., Hukic v. Aurora Loan Servs., 588 F.3d 420, 432 (7th Cir. 2009). "
1991,4," While not at issue in this case, RICO also requires that the pattern of racketeering activities ""amount to or pose a threat of 
continued criminal activity."" H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 239."
1991,5," The Court may, where a finding from a ""prior proceeding is 'not subject to reasonable dispute,'"" take judicial notice of court 
records. Gen. Elec. Capital Corp. v. Lease Resolution Corp., 128 F.3d 1074, 1081-82 (7th Cir. 1997) (quoting Fed. R. Evid. 
201(b)). Chase does not challenge the Court's consideration of the plea agreement, [see Filing No. 51], and in its brief 
acknowledges that it has pleaded guilty to antitrust violations in a different proceeding, [Filing No. 39 at 13]. "
1993,6," Mr. Blackford also argues that the Agreement should be void as against public policy, [Filing No. 41 at 7], which is one of three 
exceptions to the rule that damages limitations are enforceable, Cottey v. Brink's Home Sec., Inc., 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 579, 
2011 WL 11526, at *4 (S.D. Ind. 2011); Indiana Dep't Of Transp. v. Shelly & Sands, Inc., 756 N.E.2d 1063, 1072 (Ind. Ct. App. 
2001). Mr. Blackford fails, however, to cite to legal authority or develop this argument in such a manner as would allow for 
meaningful consideration. See Gross v. Town of Cicero, 619 F.3d 697, 704 (7th Cir. 2010); Burton v. City of Franklin, 2011 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 78161, 2011 WL 2938029, at *2 (S.D. Ind. 2011). Accordingly, the Court rejects the argument that the Agreement is 
void as against public policy. "
1994,7, None of the cases to which Mr. Blackford cites provides for the contrary. [See Filing No. 41 at 5.]
1994,8," Mr. Blackford's contract construction arguments do not change this analysis for the same reason. [See Filing No. 41 at 1-3; 
Filing No. 41 at 10-11.] Even if Mr. Blackford's contract arguments were correct, the sole consequence would be that Chase 
would have breached the Agreement and triggered the Damages Limitation Clause."
1994,9," The Court notes that Mr. Blackford's Second Amended Complaint also likely falls short of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8's 
notice pleading standards. Should Mr. Blackford decide to refile in Indiana [*18]  state court, Mr. Blackford should familiarize 
himself with Indiana pleading standards which, like the federal rules, require ""a short and plain statement of the claim showing 
that the pleader is entitled to relief."" Ind. R. Trial P. 8(A)(1). Additionally, Mr. Blackford makes numerous requests for judgment 
on the pleadings under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c). [Filing No. 41 at 7-9.] Even if the motions, contained within his brief, were properly 
before the Court, they would be moot in light of the Court's ruling on Chase's Motion to Dismiss."
1994,10," Despite the Court's dismissal of Mr. Blackford's claims, the Court retains jurisdiction over the award of fees and costs in 
connection with Chase's Motion to Compel Discovery. See, e.g., Citizens for a Better Environment v. Steel Co., 230 F.3d 923, 
927 (7th Cir. 2000) (district court retained jurisdiction to award fees and costs after dismissal of underlying claims). "
2009,1," This amended memorandum makes no substantive changes to the Memorandum of September 18, 2015. It corrects various 
typographical and/or clerical checking oversights. "
2010,2, Molting is the process whereby hens lose their feathers and regrow them—hens lay no eggs when molting. 
2011,3," ""Class Jurisdiction"" refers to the following jurisdictions, separately: Arizona, California, Florida, Iowa, Kansas, Massachusetts, 
Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, [**7]  New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, South 
Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. ""Class Jurisdictions"" refers to each of these Class 
Jurisdictions, collectively. IPP Mem. in Supp. of Class Cert. 2 (Doc. No. 1043)."
2011,4," Plaintiffs' Fifth Amended Complaint provides that ""Plaintiffs bring this action pursuant to Sections 4 and 16 of the Clayton Act, 
15 U.S.C. §§ 15 and 26 for injunctive relief . . . . Plaintiffs also bring this action [**8]  pursuant to the state antitrust and consumer 
protection laws for damages . . . ."" IPP Fifth Amended Complaint ¶ 14 (Doc. No. 866)."
2011,5," HN2[
] There are limited exceptions to the general rule that indirect purchasers cannot recover under federal antitrust law, including, potentially, a ""co-conspirator"" exception (whereby the direct purchasers and defendants are co-conspirators in 
the [**9]  illegal scheme). However, in the Third Circuit, the alleged co-conspirators must be joined as defendants in order to 
make such an argument. Howard Hess Dental Labs. Inc. v. Dentsply Int'l, Inc., 424 F.3d 363, 370 (3d Cir. 2005). Here, Plaintiffs 
have not joined direct purchasers as co-defendants or even identified them as co-conspirators. "
2013,6," The Court finds that class counsel meet the standards set forth in Rule 23(g). Counsel are experienced in class action antitrust 
litigation and certainly have been effective in litigating the case. They, like defense counsel and other plaintiffs' counsel, have "
2014,," demonstrated knowledge, expertise, professional courtesy, timeliness, and, as far as the Court can ascertain, a high level of 
proficiency."
2014,7," While district courts in the Third Circuit generally have held that the party challenging the adequacy of the class representatives 
bears the burden, this holding is not universal. See 6A Fed. Proc., L. Ed. § 12:148 (""While it has commonly been found that the 
class representatives have the burden of showing that their representation of the class will be adequate within the meaning of 
Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4), there is also authority that the burden is on the party challenging representation to prove that 
representation would be inadequate.""). Here, even if Plaintiffs had the burden, the Court would find that the class representatives 
satisfy the adequacy and typicality requirements. "
2015,8," HN17[
] The ascertainability requirement applies only to Rule 23(b)(3) classes. See Shelton v. Bledsoe, 775 F.3d 554, 563 (3d Cir. 2015) (""[A]scertainability is not a requirement for certification of a (b)(2) class seeking only injunctive and declaratory 
relief.""). "
2017,9," Plaintiffs have not provided any concrete plan for what their ""proof of purchase"" requirement would be, but have merely tee'd 
up several ideas, and have acknowledged that [**27]  the proven purchase would not need to have occurred during the class 
period. Plaintiffs' counsel explained at oral argument that ""[a] recent purchase of a commodity shell egg is all that we would 
propose. If this Court decides that the effective conspiracy period ends in 2012, for instance, . . . I would not ask a class—an 
absent class member who is filing a claim to go to their—to Costco or go to their local store and file a subpoena or make a 
demand for their purchase history. And I'm reluctant to even ask them to go to their refrigerator and write down the UPC code of 
that carton of eggs that's in their refrigerator, but I'm willing to do that. And I'm also willing to ask them to go to their receipt that 
they have. Now their receipt is not going to provide perfect information, and I [can't] even indicate in some cases whether it's a 
commodity shell egg or whether it's a specialty egg. But they can—they can write down—they can either mail us the receipt as 
part of their claim process, but they can simply write down what the product was that they purchased and where they purchased 
it and the amount they spent on it. And now, in the case where the Court has decided that the conspiracy [**28]  does not go to 
the present, one would argue, wait, that is not necessarily proof positive of a relevant purchase during the effective period. . . . 
That is true."" Tr. Hr'g 4/20/15 at 99:14-100:12. In this brief statement, Plaintiffs' counsel proposed several different possibilities 
for how the proof of purchase requirement might work in practice (e.g., requiring a UPC code, requiring a receipt, requiring that 
consumers write when they made a purchase), highlighting the extent to which Plaintiffs are merely offering possibilities and not 
a plan for ascertaining the members of the class. Although a recent receipt might seem somewhat sensible in light of a proposed class period extending to the ""present,"" if the 
Court were to certify the proposed classes, it would have a ""duty to go behind the pleadings to determine the appropriate class 
period."" Schering Plough, 589 F.3d at 602. Even if the Court were to accept the open-ended class period proposed by Plaintiffs 
(although Plaintiffs have not provided evidence to support a class period extending to the present, see general infra Part V), the 
Court would still close that period, at the very latest, when notice of any judgment was disseminated. Thus, any proof of 
purchase [**29]  would still need to be from before the notice date, at the latest, in order for it to have any bearing on class 
membership. Plaintiffs, in addition to not proposing any specific plan with respect to their proof of purchase requirement, have 
not discussed the feasibility and fairness of requiring a receipt from prior to the close of the class period, whenever that might 
ultimately prove to be. The Court observes that such a requirement would likely result in inequities to those who purchased 
commodity eggs only in the past—say, from 2006-2009—as those class members would be unable to prove class membership 
under such a plan even though they would be members of the class. "
2019,10," The Court's purpose in noting that the class definition has the potential for confusion among the class members is to analyze 
Plaintiffs' contention that [**36]  the affidavits are likely to be reliable because there is unlikely to be any confusion about whether 
a class member purchased commodity eggs. Cf. Carrera, 727 F.3d at 309 (""[A] defendant must be able to challenge class 
membership. This is especially true where the named plaintiffs deposition testimony suggested that individuals will have difficulty 
accurately recalling their purchases of WeightSmart.""). The Court is not examining whether the class definition fails to meet Rule 
23(c)(1)(B). Even if the Court were to find that the class definition did not meet Rule 23(c)(1)(B)'s requirements, the Court would 
not necessarily deny class certification on that basis, as the Court could modify deficiencies in the class definition. See, e.g., 
Chiang v. Veneman, 385 F.3d 256, 268, 46 V.I. 679 (3d Cir. 2004) (""We modify the class definition to include all 'Virgin 
Islanders,' rather than to include only 'persons who are Black, Hispanic, [and/or] female,' because we understand Chiang to be 
alleging mainly discrimination against all Virgin Islanders, rather than racial discrimination among Virgin Islanders."") abrog. on 
other grounds, Hydrogen Peroxide, 552 F.3d at 318 n.18; see also Wright & Miller, 7 A Fed. Prac. & Proc. Civ. § 1759 (3d ed.) 
(""[I]f plaintiff's definition of the class is found to be unacceptable, the court may construe the complaint or redefine [**37]  the 
class to bring it within the scope of Rule 23 or it may allow plaintiff to amend in order to limit the class."")."
2019,11," Plaintiffs did include a proposed revision of their class definition in their post-hearing memorandum. The revision clarified that 
brown eggs would be included as commodity eggs, and also included additional examples of specialty eggs. The revised 
proposal would define specialty eggs as eggs that ""are marketed as having special characteristics that make them different from 
regular shell eggs."" IPP Post-Hr'g Mem. in Supp. of Class Cert. 10. However, the potential for confusion remains as this 
definition's contours are far from self-apparent. Significant ""puffery"" on egg cartons reduces the utility of relying on marketing for 
a distinction between commodity and specialty eggs, and the additional examples of specialty eggs are non-exhaustive. See Tr. 
Hr'g 4/20/15 84:2-3 (Plaintiffs' counsel explaining the prevalence of ""puffery"" in the egg retail market)."
2019,12," For further support for the notion that the distinction between commodity and specialty eggs could breed confusion, consider 
that at the class certification hearing, Plaintiffs' counsel suggested that specialty eggs are easily [**38]  distinguishable from 
commodity eggs based on price and marketing. Plaintiffs' counsel then offered a photographic comparison of a commodity egg 
carton with a specialty egg carton, so as to demonstrate the easy distinction between the two. The Court, however, did not find 
the distinction so easy to make. The top photograph showed an egg carton with the words ""cage free"" on it, and the bottom 
photograph showed an egg carton with the words ""California Ranch Fresh"" and ""no hormones. See Tr. of 4/20/15 Hearing 
83:13-20. According to the Plaintiffs' counsel, the top photograph depicted specialty eggs and the bottom photograph depicted 
commodity eggs. The Court asked counsel whether the phrase ""no hormones"" made the egg carton a specialty egg bearing 
""marketed characteristics"" on its packaging allowing for higher prices. Id. at 83:18-20. Counsel for the Plaintiffs could not 
definitively answer, at least in the moment, whether the eggs were specialty eggs because of the phrase ""no hormones"" on the 
carton. Id. at 83:21-22. Counsel explained that many egg marketers add ""puffery"" to their egg cartons to attempt to distinguish 
their eggs from their competitors. Id. at 84:2-3. This led counsel [**39]  to argue that ""[t]he ultimate distinction, your honor, really "
2020,," is the price."" Id. at 84:13-14. But Plaintiffs have offered no guidance that would allow any class member to use price to 
distinguish commodity eggs from specialty eggs. Likewise, Plaintiffs' claims administrator testified at her deposition that she did 
not know whether eggs from hens in ""enriched cages,"" vegetarian-fed eggs, or pasteurized eggs are specialty eggs. See Defs. 
Ex. 29 at 20:14-22. The Court is unaware as to what constitutes an ""enriched cage."" "
2021,13," The Court well understands Plaintiffs' quandary here. As Judge Rendell put it in her concurring opinion in Byrd: ""We have 
effectively thwarted small-value consumer class actions by defining ascertainability in such a way that consumer classes will 
necessarily fail to satisfy for lack of adequate substantiation. Consumers now need to keep a receipt or a can, bottle, tube, or 
wrapper of the offending consumer items in order to succeed in bringing a class action."" 784 F.3d at 174-75 (Rendell, J., 
concurring). The disharmony between the Appellate Court's ascertainability requirement and Rule 23's aims has been noted by 
courts and commentators alike. See, e.g., Mullins v. Direct Digital, LLC, 795 F.3d 654, 2015 WL 4546159, at *2 (7th Cir. 2015) 
(""A court must consider the likely difficulties [**44]  in managing a class action, but in doing so it must balance countervailing 
interests to decide whether a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the 
controversy. The heightened ascertainability requirement upsets this balance. In effect, it gives one factor in the balance 
absolute priority, with the effect of barring class actions where class treatment is often most needed: in cases involving relatively 
low-cost goods or services, where consumers are unlikely to have documentary proof of purchase. These are cases where the 
class device is often essential to overcome the problem that small recoveries do not provide the incentive for any individual to 
bring a solo action prosecuting his or her rights."" (quotation marks and citation omitted)); Daniel Luks, Ascertainability in the 
Third Circuit: Name that Class Member, 82 Fordham L. Rev. 2393 (student note) (2014) (""The ascertainability doctrine as 
described in Carrera prohibits a type of representative litigation that, for over forty years, has become an accepted—albeit 
controversial—piece of the American legal system.""). In addition to having qualms concerning the disharmony between the Third Circuit Court [**45]  of Appeals's heightened 
ascertainability requirement and Rule 23 's goals, the Court poses the question why affidavits, which are by definition sworn 
under oath, are, for purposes of ascertainability, essentially considered incompetent evidence. Affidavits are competent evidence 
as to facts, in most other settings—indeed, uncontroverted affidavits are often accepted as conclusive evidence. See 2A C.J.S. 
Affidavits § 44 (""Courts must accept an affidavit as true if it is uncontradicted by a counter-affidavit or other evidentiary 
materials.""); see, e.g., In re Cendant Corp. PRIDES Litig., 235 F.3d 176, 183 (3d Cir. 2000) (""We have accepted the 
uncontroverted affidavits of Preston and Figueroa.""); Rodriguez v. Reading Hous. Auth., 8 F.3d 961, 966 (3d Cir. 1993) (""In light 
of this uncontroverted affidavit, we must reject Rivera's argument.""). For purposes of a class action, however, an uncontroverted 
affidavit swearing to a purchase is not sufficient evidence to establish class membership. The Court is at a loss to explain why 
this might be. Cf. generally Mullins, 795 F.3d 654, 2015 WL 4546159, at *13 (""Why are affidavits from putative class members 
deemed insufficient as a matter of law to satisfy this burden? In other words, no one disputes that the plaintiff carries the burden; 
the decisive question is whether certain evidence is sufficient to meet it. . . . If not disputed, [**46]  self-serving affidavits can 
support a defendant's motion for summary judgment, for example, and defendants surely will be entitled to a fair opportunity to 
challenge self-serving affidavits from plaintiffs."" (citation omitted)). However, having expressed the dilemma and even exposed 
further disharmony, the Court is left to observe that it does not fall to the courts to make sure every claimant has a validated 
platform from which to dive into litigation. "
2022,14," Plaintiffs have not provided the Court with an analysis of whether the elements for establishing an antitrust violation under any 
of the states' antitrust laws differ in such a way that common issues [**50]  are more or less likely to predominate under those 
states' antitrust laws than federal antitrust law. To the contrary, Plaintiffs appear to assume that there are no relevant 
differences for purposes of class certification. The Court will indulge this assumption here merely because common issues do 
not predominate even as to the federal elements of an antitrust claim. "
2023,15," The Court chose the word non-conspirators rather than non-defendants because, in the Court's view, the issue here is most 
acute as to the inclusion of eggs produced outside the UEP certified program, as they would not have been required to comply 
with the conspiracy's alleged supply-cutting measures."
2023,16," HN30[
] Antitrust standing, unlike Article III standing, does not affect the subject-matter jurisdiction of the Court. Ethypharm S.A. France v. Abbott Labs., 707 F.3d 223, 232 (3d Cir. 2013). "
2025,17," Admittedly, the economic underpinnings of Mid-West Paper have been questioned by courts and commentators for decades. 
Critics have noted that if conspirators hold a truly [**58]  dominant market share, it would be futile and foolish for a non-
conspirator to keep its price at competitive levels and try to increase its supply to meet the increased demand for its product as a 
result of the cartel. See Roger D. Blair & Virginia G. Maurer, Umbrella Pricing and Antitrust Standing: An Economic Analysis, 
1982 Utah L. Rev. 763, 764 (""[F]ringe firms will not act as though their output decisions have a perceptible influence on price. 
Accordingly, they charge the current market price and simply adjust their output level to maximize profits. Thus, the fringe firms 
set their prices under the 'umbrella' of the dominant firms.""). Thus, a rational non-conspirator would raise its prices above 
competitive levels as a result of the cartel's output reduction. See Roger D. Blair & William H. Page, ""Speculative"" Antitrust 
Damages, 70 Wash. L. Rev. 423, 442 (1995) (""Economic theory shows that a rational fringe competitor will match the price 
increase of a dominant firm (or cartel) in its market; if it did not do so, it would fail to maximize its profits.""). According to critics, it 
is ""self-evident"" that ""just as the size of the output restriction affects the size of the overcharge to purchasers from cartel 
members, it also affects the size of the [**59]  overcharge by the competitive fringe."" See Page, Scope of Liability, supra at 
1465-67 (""Just as the size of the output restriction affects the size of the overcharge to purchasers from cartel members, it also 
affects the size of the overcharge by the competitive fringe. As self-evident as the foregoing points are, the leading case denying 
recovery to purchasers in these instances [Mid-West Paper] seriously misconceived the economics of the issue in suggesting 
that there is no necessary causal relationship between the cartel's price increase and the nonconspiring firm's pricing.""); accord 
Blair & Page, ""Speculative"" Antitrust Damages, supra at 442 (""Economic theory shows that a rational fringe competitor will match 
the price increase of a dominant firm (or cartel) in its market; if it did not do so, it would fail to maximize its profits. Consequently, 
if purchasers from the nonconspiring firm can prove that their supplier increased its price to match the illegally fixed price of the 
defendants, they should recover.""); Standing of Purchasers from Nonconspirators to Challenge Price-Fixing Conspiracy: Mid-
West Paper Products Co. v. Continental Group, Inc., 93 Harv. L. Rev. 598, 605 (1980) (""Although causation might have been 
more difficult to prove in Mid-West than in the typical price-fixing [**60]  case, the court's assertion that only a 'tenuous line of 
causation' links the prices paid by the plaintiffs to the defendants' conspiracy overlooks important characteristics of price-fixing 
conspiracies. . . . The typical price-fixing case occurs in a market for fungible goods in which producers are sensitive to their 
competitors' prices. Absent the price umbrella, a nonconspiring seller could exceed the market price only at the risk of a 
significant loss in his market share. Thus, when a purchaser from a nonconspirator pays more than the price that would have 
prevailed in the industry absent the conspiracy the defendants' conspiracy is the likely cause.""). Indeed, some courts have 
embraced the position advocated by these commentators. See, e.g., U.S. Gypsum Co. v. Ind. Gas Co., 350 F.3d 623, 627 (7th 
Cir. 2003) (Easterbrook, J.) (""A cartel cuts output, which elevates price throughout the market; customers of fringe firms (sellers 
that have not joined the cartel) pay this higher price, and thus suffer antitrust injury, just like customers of the cartel's 
members.""); In re Uranium Antitrust Litig., 552 F. Supp. 518, 525 (N.D. Ill. 1982) (""Once the 'competitive' price of the 
nonconspirators is determined, it is not only logical but essential to infer that any price higher than that which the 
nonconspirators charged was [**61]  the result of the cartel, since in a non-cartelized market, a seller can charge a higher than 
competitive price only at the risk of losing market share and profits.""). Despite these contrary positions, Mid-West Paper remains 
binding precedent in this circuit. Cf. In re Skelaxin (Metaxalone) Antitrust Litig., No. 1:12-MD-2343, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 66707, 
2014 WL 2002887, at *11 (E.D. Tenn. May 15, 2014) (""That generic prices typically rise when there are fewer generic suppliers 
does not distinguish this case from any other antitrust case in which the laws of supply and demand suggest that anticompetitive 
conduct will raise prices on a broad scale.""). "
2026,18," Later in the Lower Lake Erie opinion, the court reaffirmed the rule in Mid-West Paper that damages paid to non-conspiring 
competitors are not recoverable. The court considered the defense argument that ""the steel companies dock damages are also 
barred by Mid—West Paper, because these damages resulted from amounts paid to non-conspiring [**65]  competitors of the 
defendant."" Id. at 1169-70. The court first reiterated the holding that ""direct purchasers from defendants' competitors lack[ ] 
standing to sue on the grounds that the competitors' prices would have been lower but for the defendants' illegal price fixing."" Id. 
Then, the court rejected defendants' argument, but not by rejecting Mid-West Paper—rather, the court observed that ""[t]he jury 
awarded dock damages for the steel companies' inability to utilize the private docks to handle iron ore. Thus, the damages arose 
from the conspiracy's effective attempt to eliminate competition from private docks, not from the charges which might have been 
paid to those private docks."" Id. In other words, in Lower Lake Erie, unlike in Mid-West Paper, plaintiffs were not seeking to 
recover for purchases from competitors of the conspirators."
2026,19," Although Plaintiffs have produced some evidence that pricing in the eggs market is often tied to prices listed by Urner Barry, 
an agricultural price reporting firm, Plaintiffs have not explained to the Court how the Urner Barry prices are determined, other 
than by offering the somewhat circular explanation that Urner Barry posts ""where . . . the market is at today, so [**66]  to speak."" 
See Tr. Hr'g 4/20/15 23-24. Plaintiffs' expert, Dr. Kyle Stiegert's explanation is similarly unhelpful in explaining Urner Barry 
pricing: ""Urner Barry . . . goes out and collects information about the market for eggs and establishes a regional price for eggs, 
reports it, and makes that claim that that is the price for the region. It uses surveys, it gets on the phone, talks to buyers and 
sellers. It may do a number of other things. I'm not entirely sure because it's a proprietary formula. So from what we have 
learned there is a process they go through to make that determination that is reasonably trusted by the industry."" Tr. Hr'g 
4/20/15 210:24-211:8. These explanation certainly leave room for egg prices to correlate with Urner Barry pricing even if 
insulated from a supply reduction, as Urner Barry might well include feed costs and the prices of cost-plus contracts in its 
calculations. "
2029,20," These findings as to the market structure (at the direct purchaser level) for eggs are largely uncontested by Defendants. 
These findings are also probative of the extent to which the alleged conspiracy, if proven, would have affected the market."
2029,21, The formula is: (percent change in supply)/(percent change in price)=demand elasticity.
2029,22," That is, he multiplies the deficiency in the supply of eggs by -1/.2 (or -5) to determine the increase in price—e.g., if [**77]  1% 
of eggs were taken out of the supply, the total effect on price would be -.01*(−1/.2)=.05=5% increase in price. "
2030,23, No challenge has been made to Dr. Stiegert's qualifications. 
2033,24," The Court finds unpersuasive, if not borderline hyperbolic, the anecdotal statements to the effect that ""100% [of egg 
producers] have benefitted,"" see IPP Hr'g Binder Tab 16 (citing Baker Dep. at NL001236), as these opinions are unsubstantiated 
by any direct evidence of how the conspiracy affected non-conspiring producers. "
2035,25," Plaintiffs also offer anecdotal deposition testimony in support of the prevalence of Urner Barry pricing (although, as previously 
discussed, Plaintiffs did not explain to the Court how Urner Barry prices are set and appear to be assuming that the prices have 
a direct and consistent relationship to the conduct alleged here, see supra, note 19)."
2035,26," Defendants posit that from 2011-2013 alone, cost-plus transactions would have totaled at least $470 million, not including 
sales by non-defendant producers. See Defendants' Post-Hr'g Submission 13 n.9. "
2037,27," Dr. Stiegert's analysis of how the retail prices of eggs in 51 locales are correlated is likewise not persuasive that a single pass-
through rate is appropriate (let alone this particular pass-through rate). As Dr. Murphy explained in his Declaration: "
2038,," The fact that prices in two cities are highly correlated does not imply that pass-through rates in the two cities must be 
similar. Suppose that changes in the wholesale prices in city A always resulted in an equivalent increase in retail prices, 
implying a pass-through rate of 1. Suppose that changes in wholesale prices in city B always resulted in a change in retail 
prices that was one half of the change in wholesale prices, implying a pass-through rate of 0.5. Suppose further that the 
change in wholesale prices in city A always equals the change in wholesale prices in city B—an assumption that is 
consistent with Dr. Stiegert's view that wholesale prices in different parts of the country are highly correlated because of 
arbitrage. Under these circumstances, retail prices in cities A and B will be highly [**112]  correlated (and, indeed, will have 
a correlation coefficient of 1.0) even though the pass-through rates in the two cities by construction are significantly different 
(1.0 and 0.5). Murphy Decl. 11. Dr. Murphy also demonstrates in his Declaration that, ""notwithstanding the correlation coefficient of .949 
between prices in Columbus and Cleveland, knowing the amount of an increase in egg prices in Cleveland does not allow one to 
predict reliably in any given case that egg prices in Columbus went up at all."" See Murphy Decl. 25-26. "
2040,28," The Court is also troubled by the use of population as a proxy for egg purchases in each Class Jurisdiction without evidence 
supporting the assumption that the populations of Class Jurisdictions purchase eggs at the same rate or that the overcharge 
rates are similar. This concern is exacerbated by the recognition of the lengthy time period for the proposed classes. Also, the 
Court is troubled that, according to Dr. Murphy, Dr. Stiegert did not properly analyze how the magnitude of the change at the 
wholesale level affects the magnitude of the change in the pass-through rate. In other words, a 15% increase in price at the 
wholesale level is perhaps more likely to be passed through at a higher rate than a 1.5% increase, but Dr. Stiegert did not 
properly account for this. As Dr. Murphy explained on cross examination: Q: Do you understand what [Dr. Stiegert] did was the product of the averages? A: In some sense, yes, because the average—we had a coefficient. It's not even that good really because the regression 
coefficient isn't really a [**121]  matrix weighted average of all of the different changes. So it's [ ] weighted by the degree of 
changes in the data set that you are looking at, not by the degree of changes in the variables you ultimately get run through 
it. So—I make this point in my labor class. . . . It's really important actually if you want to understand business cycles, 
because different groups in the economy have their wages move different amounts over the business cycle. Some groups 
have very cyclical wages and some groups don't and they also have different responses to those wages. So if you take the 
average response and multiply it by the average change in wage, you greatly mis-estimate what the impact of wage 
changes are on the amount people work, because the people who have the biggest response have the biggest change in 
wages. And if you ignore that and just multiply the average coefficient by the average change, you get way the wrong 
answer, very, very far off. And this is the point. It's just well known that you can't just take averages across averages and 
then think you have the right total. It just does not work. Tr. Hr'g 4/21/15 280:20-281:25. "
2041,29," Those seven states are California, Florida, Massachusetts, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Carolina, and Vermont."
2041,30," Those 17 states are Arizona, California, Florida, Iowa, Kansas, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, 
New Mexico, North Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wisconsin."
2041,31," Moreover, Plaintiffs have not addressed whether common issues are likely to predominate as to the unjust enrichment laws in 
the 17 states. Plaintiffs have provided citations to the elements of unjust enrichment in these states, but Plaintiffs have not 
sufficiently analyzed whether these elements are capable of common proof. As Plaintiffs themselves note, there are a variety of 
state-of-mind requirements in the unjust enrichment laws, see Reply Mem. 66 (citing standards ranging from knowledge and 
appreciation to willfulness), and, as Judge Mitchell Goldberg [**124]  of this District recently noted, significant differences among 
the laws of unjust enrichment requires that Plaintiffs provide a detailed accounting of the state variations along with a feasible 
method for grouping them, see Vista Healthplan, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 74846, 2015 WL 3623005 at *34. More fundamentally, 
""[notwithstanding the variances in the applicable state law, the equitable nature of the unjust enrichment remedy also 
compounds the predominance issues with Plaintiffs' proposed unjust enrichment class."" Id. Although Plaintiffs have provided 
citations to the elements of unjust enrichment in these states, Plaintiffs have not sufficiently analyzed whether these elements 
are capable of common proof, and, as the Court will discuss with respect to manageability, have not provided the Court with a 
detailed plan for grouping the differing claims so that they can be presented to the same jury. "
2043,32," The Third Circuit Court of Appeals has held that HN43[
] ""ascertainability is not a requirement for certification of a (b)(2) 
class seeking only injunctive and declaratory relief."" Shelton, 775 F.3d at 563. "
2045,33," The Court also observes the potential for prejudice to the class members' rights to a jury trial on their damages claims. The 
Supreme Court has instructed that ""[i]f there should be cases where the availability of declaratory judgment or joinder in one suit 
of legal and equitable causes would not in all respects protect the plaintiff seeking equitable relief from irreparable harm while 
affording a jury trial in the legal cause, the trial court will necessarily have to use its discretion in deciding whether the legal or 
equitable cause should be tried first. Since the right to jury trial is a constitutional one, however, while no similar requirement 
protects trials by the court, that discretion is very narrowly limited and must, wherever possible, be exercised to preserve jury 
trial."" Beacon Theatres, Inc. v. Westover, 359 U.S. 500, 510, 79 S. Ct. 948, 956, 3 L. Ed. 2d 988 (1959); see also Allison v. Citgo 
Petroleum Corp., 151 F.3d 402, 424 (5th Cir. 1998) (""In deciding whether the district [**139]  court should have temporarily 
severed the disparate impact claim for class treatment, we must ascertain whether this claim shares any factual issues with the 
pattern or practice claim, which both parties are entitled to have decided first by a jury.""). On the other hand, the refusal to certify 
the Rule 23(b)(3) classes might render moot the Seventh Amendment issues, because there is no longer a corresponding legal 
claim from the class on which a jury trial is demanded. See Coleman v. Gen. Motors Acceptance Corp., 220 F.R.D. 64, 85 (M.D. 
Tenn. 2004) (""Here, the defendant attempts to show that the Seventh Amendment would be violated by determining issues now 
that might be common to hypothetical, follow-on suits for money damages that may or may not be brought, not live claims for 
which a jury has been timely and properly demanded. This is not mandated by the Trial by Jury Clause, and the court will not 
deny class certification on this ground.""). At any rate, the Court's reflections cannot replace rigorous analysis of whether the trial 
rights of the class members are implicated here. Plaintiffs (and Defendants as well, although Plaintiffs bear the burden of 
demonstrating the propriety of class certification) have not adequately addressed whether these Seventh Amendment concerns 
apply here and, if so, how this issue weighs upon class certification. [**140]  The Court has not been presented with the 
materials to conduct the rigorous analysis required here."
2045,34," The Court will assume for purposes of this analysis that the Rule 23(a) factors with respect to the putative injunctive class 
have been met. That assumption, however, will need to be discarded should Plaintiffs seek reconsideration of the denial of the 
certification of the Rule 23(b)(2) class. The Court will need to undertake a rigorous analysis of any proposed class, including 
whether the class definition (including any provision excluding purchasers of specialty eggs) is sufficiently clear. "

rather than harm just to competitors or consumers. "
2062,10," See, e.g., Serfecz v. Jewel Food Stores, 67 F.3d 591 (7th Cir. 1995); Southaven Land Co. v. Malone & Hyde, Inc., 715 F.2d 
1079 (6th Cir. 1983); Acme Mkts., Inc. v. Wharton Hardware & Supply Corp., 890 F. Supp. 1230 (D.N.J. 1995); Rosenberg v. 
Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton, 598 F. Supp. 642 (S.D.N.Y. 1984)."
2062,11," Defendants also urge us to follow Rosenberg, a decades-old district court [**29]  decision from outside this circuit. Although 
Rosenberg involved similar facts to those here—competitor supermarkets filing a series of lawsuits to enjoin the construction of 
a new supermarket—the court's legal analysis is not persuasive. See 598 F. Supp. at 643-44. The court mechanically applied 
Southaven without even mentioning the possibility of antitrust injury based on the ""inextricably intertwined"" exception. Id. at 645. "
2064,12," Although the District Court did not discuss Noerr-Pennington, we will address this issue in the first instance because it raises 
questions of law over which we exercise plenary review and has been fully briefed by the parties. See Hudson United Bank v. 
LiTenda Mortg. Corp., 142 F.3d 151, 159 (3d Cir. 1998). The same goes for Defendants' other arguments for dismissal, which 
we discuss further below. "
2065,13," Defendants maintain that Hanover Realty waived its argument regarding applying the California Motor analysis because it 
never raised this issue before the District Court and it did not raise the issue on appeal until its supplemental reply brief. See 
Gardiner v. V.I. Water & Power Auth., 145 F.3d 635, 646-47, 39 V.I. 519 (3d Cir. 1998). Defendants argue that, before the 
District Court, Hanover Realty agreed it had to satisfy the test from Professional Real Estate. We disagree that Hanover Realty 
has waived this argument. Throughout this litigation Defendants have consistently argued for Noerr-Pennington immunity and 
Hanover Realty has consistently responded that the sham exception applies. Hanover Realty's failure to cite particular [**37]  
cases within its broader argument for the sham exception does not amount to a waiver. Moreover, by alleging an ""illegal 
scheme"" through a ""series of sham litigations,"" Hanover Realty put Defendants on notice of the relevant facts supporting its 
theory under California Motor. App. 63. Finally, Defendants have not been prejudiced by this argument because we exercise 
plenary review over this issue and they have filed a supplemental brief responding to Hanover Realty's position."
2065,14," A staff report from the Federal Trade Commission also agrees with this view. See Federal Trade Commission, Enforcement 
Perspectives 
on 
the 
Noerr-Pennington 
Doctrine, 
at 
28-38 
(2006) 
(""FTC 
Report""),

noerr-pennington-doctrine/p013518enfperspectnoerr-penningtondoctrine.pdf . "
2067,15," Defendants also argue that, because some of the proceedings are ongoing, Hanover Realty's suit is premature. We reject this 
argument becauseHN20[
]  the California Motor analysis is prospective, not retrospective. [**47]  See USS-POSCO, 31 F.3d at"
2067,810," -11. If we were to agree with Defendants on this point, they could keep filing petitions and avoid judicial review indefinitely. "
2068,16," Because we already found that Hanover Realty does not have antitrust standing for its claim of attempted monopolization of 
the full-service supermarket shopping center market (Count Two), we address here only the claim relating to full-service 
supermarkets (Count One)."
2068,17," We have considered and rejected Defendants' remaining arguments. They argue there is no dangerous probability of 
achieving a monopoly because [**50]  there is another full-service supermarket in the area—the Stop & Shop of Morris Plains. 
Defendants maintain that Hanover Realty has admitted this fact. But in making that argument, Defendants rely on Hanover 
Realty's initial complaint, not its amended complaint, which is operative. In the amended complaint, Hanover Realty alleges that 
the Stop & Shop is a ""grocery store,"" App. 72, and that ShopRite is the ""only full-service supermarket"" in Greater Morristown, 
App. 73. We must accept those allegations as true. Defendants' final argument is that Hanover Realty has failed to allege a 
specific intent to monopolize. For the reasons discussed above in connection with the Noerr-Pennington doctrine, we conclude 
Hanover Realty sufficiently alleges that Defendants filed a series of sham proceedings with the intent to interfere with a 
prospective competitor and restrain trade. "
2069,1," Our law that a plaintiff ought to be a consumer or competitor and that the ""inextricably intertwined"" injury presents a limited 
""exception"" to this ""requirement"" is not the only way to read the relevant [**53]  Supreme Court cases. The leading case on 
antitrust standing treated consumer-or-competitor status as one of several factors a court should weigh in considering whether a 
plaintiff has antitrust standing, Associated Gen. Contractors v. Cal. State Council of Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 539, 103 S. Ct. 
897, 74 L. Ed. 2d 723 (1983), and in other circuits consumer-or-competitor status is less strongly emphasized. See, e.g., Novell, 
Inc. v. Microsoft Corp., 505 F.3d 302, 311 (4th Cir. 2007). However, it is the settled law of our Court. "
2070,2," Blue Shield's argument was based in part on a now-outmoded theory that only the ""target"" of an antitrust violation could bring 
suit. Id. at 478 n.14 & 479 n.15; see also Associated Gen. Contractors, 459 U.S. at 536 n.33 (rejecting ""target area"" theory). "
2073,3," Union Gas is less squarely on point because no majority supported that judgment on every point. The issues were (1) whether 
two Congressional statutes were intended to abrogate state sovereign immunity and (2) whether Congress had that power under 
the Commerce Clause. 491 U.S. at 5. Five justices held the statutes purported to annul state sovereign immunity and five that 
Congress had the power to do so. Id. at 13. However, only four justices agreed on a rationale for Congress's constitutional 
power. Justice White's cryptic concurrence stated on the constitutional question only that ""I agree with the conclusion reached by 
Justice Brennan in Part III of his opinion, that Congress has the authority under Article I to abrogate the Eleventh Amendment 
immunity of the States, although I do not agree with much of his reasoning."" Union Gas Co., 491 U.S. at 57 (White, J., "
2074,," concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part). It was this absence of reasoning—not, as Judge Greenberg's dissent 
suggests, Justice White's yielding to his colleagues on the statutory interpretation question—that [**68]  caused the ""confusion"" 
noted in Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 64, 116 S. Ct. 1114, 134 L. Ed. 2d 252 (1996) (""Justice White, who 
provided the fifth vote for the result, wrote separately in order to indicate his disagreement with the plurality's rationale."")."
2074,4," There may also be some support for issue voting in our decision in United States v. Bazzano, 712 F.2d 826 (3d Cir. 1983) (en 
banc) (per curiam). In that case, nine of the ten judges would have voted to remand [**69]  the case to the District Court. But no 
majority could agree on what the District Court should do on remand. Id. at 829 (noting that the ""differing grounds on which these 
various votes for remand are rested cannot be reconciled so as to yield a majority vote for a remand with consistent instructions 
to the district court""). We thus affirmed the District Court's judgment, despite nine of the ten judges agreeing on the outcome, 
because no majority could agree on rationale."
2074,5," This equation of precedent with an issue is problematic in a court that has power to overrule its precedent, like the en banc 
Third Circuit or the Supreme Court. Indeed, when a panel is in a position to overrule prior precedent, a voting paradox may be 
more likely. See David S. Cohen, The Precedent-Based Voting Paradox, 90 B.U. L. Rev. 183, 184 (2010). Luckily, that is not the 
case with a panel of this Court. See Third Circuit I.O.P. 9.1 (""It is the tradition of this court that the holding of a panel in a 
precedential opinion is binding on subsequent panels. Thus, no subsequent panel overrules the holding in a precedential opinion 
of a previous panel. Court en banc consideration is required to do so.""). "
2076,6," This is not to say that judges should not dissent. In that sense, courts are not fully team enterprises. "
2077,7," Judge Greenberg also relies on an article by then-Professor Rogers, who concluded that ""over 150 Supreme Court cases 
involving plurality majority opinions indicate that a justice should not [aggregate votes by issue and therefore] defer to a majority 
that disagrees on a dispositive issue."" John M. Rogers, ""I Vote This Way Because I'm Wrong"": The Supreme Court Justice as 
Epimenides, 79 Ky. L.J. 439, 459 (1990-91). But not one of that large number of cases actually purports to say how a judge 
""should"" vote. Moreover, by Judge Rogers' own count, only between fourteen and sixteen cases involved situations where the 
justices voted by outcome when an issue-vote would have yielded a different result. Id. at 448 & n.24. In light of the three [**82]  
cases where justices voted by issue and the Supreme Court's silence in all cases on whether issue- or outcome-based voting is 
preferable, I do not see how we can fairly understand the Court to have settled the question of the proper voting protocol. 
Kornhauser & Sager, supra, at 57 (""Current appellate practice with regard to paradoxical cases is in shambles. The Supreme 
Court, in particular, has been unmindful of the existence of the paradox, even when confronted with cases whose dispositions 
turn on the choice of alternative voting protocols.""). "
2078,1, I refer to Village and Hanover and Horsehill Development LLC together as defendants. 
2079,2," Defendants raised this argument both in the District Court and in their answering brief on appeal. 3201 Realty failed to address 
the merits of the argument in its reply brief, but we afforded it an opportunity to do so in a supplemental reply brief and it did so. "
2080,3," As I explain below there now is an additional case that Village has initiated to consider. See infra note 5. But the addition of this 
case does not change my conclusion. "
2081,4," I agree with Judge Ambro and Judge Fuentes that the circumstance that some of defendants' legal actions are ongoing does 
not preclude application of the sham exception, although I do so based on Supreme Court precedent and not based on the 
""prospective"" character of the alternative test. Majority typescript at 37 n.14. In Vendo Co. v. Lektro-Vend Corp., 433 U.S. 623, 
97 S.Ct. 2881, 53 L. Ed. 2d 1009 (1977), the Court faced the question of whether [**97]  a district court could enjoin an ongoing "
2082,," state court proceeding that allegedly violated federal antitrust law. The Court fractured into three opinions, none of which 
obtained a majority. See id. at 626, 97 S.Ct. at 2885 (plurality opinion of Rehnquist, J.); id. at 643, 97 S.Ct. at 2893 (Blackmun, 
J., concurring in result); id. at 645, 97 S.Ct. at 2894 (Stevens, J., dissenting). Nevertheless, although a majority of the Court 
concluded that the Anti-Injunction Act barred the district court from enjoining the state court proceeding at issue, all nine justices 
either explicitly or implicitly acknowledged that plaintiffs can seek some form of relief, such as damages or injunctions against 
future legal actions, based on ongoing sham proceedings brought in violation of the antitrust laws. See id. at 635 n.6, 637 n.8, 97 
S.Ct. at 2889 n.6, 2890 n.8 (plurality opinion of Rehnquist, J.); id. at 644, 97 S.Ct. at 2894 (Blackmun, J., concurring in result); id. 
at 653-54, 97 S.Ct. at 2899 (Stevens, J., dissenting). Indeed, six of the justices declared that, in appropriate circumstances, such 
antitrust relief could include an injunction against the ongoing sham proceedings themselves. See id. at 644, 97 S.Ct. at 2894 
(Blackmun, J., concurring in result); id. at 654, 660, 97 S.Ct. at 2899, 2902 (Stevens, J., dissenting). Subsequently, in a case 
arising under federal labor law, the Court drew on the sham exception to Noerr-Pennington to hold that an ongoing [**98]  
baseless lawsuit may be enjoined if it was brought for an improper purpose. See Bill Johnson's Rests., Inc. v. NLRB, 461 U.S. 
731, 744, 103 S.Ct. 2161, 2170, 76 L. Ed. 2d 277 (1983). These Supreme Court cases illustrate that a plaintiff can bring an antitrust claim circumventing Noerr-Pennington immunity by 
relying on the sham exception even if the allegedly sham legal actions remain pending. This conclusion is logical given that a 
determination of whether anticompetitive legal actions fall within the sham exception turns not on their ultimate outcomes but on 
the existence of a reasonable basis (or a proper motive) for instituting and pursuing them in the first place. See PRE, 508 U.S. at 
60 n.5, 113 S.Ct. at 1928 n.5. "
2083,5," On September 10, 2015, 3201 Realty's attorneys filed a letter with attachments pursuant to Fed. R. App. P. 28(j) indicating that 
Village's chief operating officer on August 12, 2015, filed a complaint in the Superior Court of New Jersey seeking an injunction "
2084,," stopping the clearing work on 3201 Realty's property on the ground that 3201 Realty obtained its wetland permit by fraud. To the 
best of my knowledge this case has not been resolved so I do not take it into account as I do not know if the suit is objectively 
baseless. "
2088,6," In my view, this case can be resolved by making simple mathematical calculations that do not require that we use a super 
computer: (1) one and one make two, and (2) two out of three is a majority. "
2094,1, The information contained in this chart is derived from records of the New York City Department of Transportation. 
2097,1," The document and page references used in this Report reflect the document and page numbers enumerated in the court's

2098,2," Walmart asserts that the operating entity of the Walmart store that Broodnox visited, and thus the correct Defendant in this 
action, is Wal-Mart Stores East, LP (see ECF No. 2 at 1 n.1). Therefore, the docket [*4]  has been modified to substitute 
Defendant Wal-Mart Stores East, LP for Defendant ""all walmarts."" "
2100,3," [*10] ""Ordinarily, a party must be given at least one opportunity to amend before the district court dismisses the complaint."" 
Corsello v. Lincare, Inc., 428 F.3d 1008, 1014 (11th Cir. 2005). However, ""[a] district court need not . . . allow an amendment (1) 
where there has been undue delay, bad faith, dilatory motive, or repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously 
allowed; (2) where allowing amendment would cause undue prejudice to the opposing party; or (3) where amendment would be 
futile."" Bryant v. Dupree, 252 F.3d 1161, 1163 (11th Cir. 2001). Amendment would be futile in this instance, because the facts as 
alleged in the complaint, viewed in a light most favorable to Broodnox, could not be stated in any fashion so as to show that he is 
entitled to relief against Wal-Mart under § 1983. "
2103,4," If Broodnox is granted permission to proceed IFP (as he was granted in state court), the court would be ""obligated to issue 
plaintiff's process to a United States Marshal who must in turn effectuate service upon the defendants."" Rance v. Rocksolid 
Granit USA, Inc., 583 F.3d 1284, 1286 (11th Cir. 2009); see also Johnson v. Bates, No. 1:13cv87/MMP/GRJ, 2014 U.S. Dist.

2106,1," Leica initially sued Kovach in this case, but Leica and Kovach have since entered into a September 14, 2015 agreed order of 
dismissal with prejudice. "
2107,2," Complete preemption is an exception to the well-pleaded complaint rule. ""[W]hen a federal statute wholly displaces the state-law cause of action through complete pre-emption,"" the state claim can 
be removed. This is so because ""[w]hen the federal statute completely pre-empts the state-law cause of action, a claim 
which comes within the scope of that cause of action, even if pleaded in terms of state law, is in reality based on federal 
law. Aetna Health Inc. v. Davila, 542 U.S. 200, 207-08, 124 S. Ct. 2488, 159 L. Ed. 2d 312 (2004) (alterations in original) (citations 
omitted) (quoting Beneficial Nat'l Bank v. Anderson, 539 U.S. 1, 8, 123 S. Ct. 2058, 156 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2003)). In the notice of 
removal, Kovach alleged that, despite Leica's artful efforts to plead only state-law claims, its claim for trade secret 
misappropriation arises under and is preempted by the federal Copyright Act. Although Leica argues in its motion to remand that 
the federal Copyright Act does not preempt its state-law claims, Hernandez and Orion have neither responded to this argument 
nor attempted to address preemption as a basis for removal. They focus instead only on their argument based on Grable & Sons 
Metal Prods., Inc. v. Darue Eng'g & Mfg., 545 U.S. 308, 125 S. Ct. 2363, 162 L. Ed. 2d 257 (2005), which the court discusses 
below. The court will address [*7]  only the grounds on which Hernandez and Orion rely in their response to Leica's motion to 
remand. "
2109,3," Because Kovach has been dismissed by agreement, the court is not addressing whether Leica is entitled to recover attorney's 
fees, expenses, and costs from him. "
2112,1," Defendant's unopposed request for judicial notice is GRANTED, and the Court takes notice of the adjudicative facts contained 
therein. See ECF No. 68. Defendant requests that the Court take judicial notice of documents incorporated by reference into the 
FAC (emails quoted in the FAC ¶¶ 29, 31, 32, 34, 39, 41), matters of public record (SEC filings, filings submitted to the Oregon 
Secretary of State's Office, and filings submitted to the Pennsylvania Department of State), and newspaper articles. These 
documents are appropriate for judicial notice. See Knievel v. ESPN, 393 F.3d 1068, 1076 (9th Cir. 2005) (documents referenced 
in complaint but not physically attached); Lee v. City of Los Angeles, 250 F.3d 668, 689-90 (9th Cir. 2001) (matters of public 
record), overruled on other grounds by Galbraith v. Cnty. of Santa Clara, 307 F.3d 1119, 1125-26 (9th Cir. 2002); Von Saher v. 
Norton Simon Museum of Art at Pasadena, 592 F.3d 954, 960 (9th Cir. 2010) (media publications); see also Fed. R. Evid. 
201(d). Plaintiffs' unopposed request for judicial notice is likewise GRANTED, and the Court takes notice of the adjudicative facts 
contained therein. See ECF No. 70, Ex. 1. Plaintiffs request that the Court take judicial notice of matters of public record (an 
official document in a DOJ file, complaints filed with federal district courts, and final judgments of federal district courts). These 
documents [**9]  are appropriate for judicial notice. See Lee, 250 F.3d at 689-90. "
2114,2," Plaintiff Ryan worked for Microsoft from April [**12]  2007 to September 2012. FAC ¶ 15. Plaintiff Rau worked for Microsoft 
from June 2006 to June 2010. Id. ¶ 17."
2114,3," The DOJ ultimately filed lawsuits alleging antitrust violations against Google and eBay, but not against Microsoft. See ECF No. 
70. "
2118,4, Plaintiff Ryan began working for Microsoft in 2007. FAC ¶ 17. 
2119,5," Microsoft argues that only United States v. eBay could provide sufficient tolling to render Plaintiffs' claims timely because both 
United States v. Adobe and United States v. Lucasfilm concluded more than a year prior to October 16, 2014. See ECF No. 71, 
at 1-2. Section 16(i) provides that the statute of limitations for Sherman Act claims brought by private individuals expires no later 
than one year after the termination of a related government proceeding or within four years after the cause of action accrued. 
See Aurora Enters., 688 F.2d at 693 (holding that a DOJ action that settled more than a year before the filing of the plaintiff's 
Sherman Act claim did not toll the statute of limitations). However, section 16(i) does not place the same limit on state law 
claims, so section 16(i) may toll the statute of limitations longer for state law claims. See 15 U.S.C. § 16(i) Because Plaintiffs' 
arguments for tolling based on each of the three government-filed lawsuits all fail, the Court need not reach whether Plaintiffs' 
state law claims could be tolled for longer than Plaintiffs' Sherman Act claim. "
2125,6," Microsoft argues that all of the alleged non-solicitation agreements were unilateral agreements in which Microsoft agreed not to 
solicit from its partners in order to ""protect Microsoft's business partners, customers, vendors, and affiliated companies from 
Microsoft's recruiting efforts."" See ECF No. 67 at 14-16. [**51]  Several emails quoted in the First Amended Complaint indicate 
that the Hands-Off List was a list of Microsoft business partners. For example, the First Amended Complaints quotes an 
unidentified Microsoft executive as stating that ""[t]he purpose of this list is an internal record for staffing of [Microsoft's] non-solicit 
commitments to partners & customers [worldwide.]"" FAC ¶ 34. The First Amended Complaint also quotes an email from Dell's 
CEO to Microsoft asking to discuss entering a non-solicitation agreement in light of ""our partnership."" Id. As stated above, 
Plaintiffs also quote an email between Microsoft ""recruitment managers"" confirming that ""we will not be hiring from, nor 
rewarding our employees for, hiring employees of partners on our 'hands off' list."" Id. ¶ 51."
2125,7," The only example of an effort to keep an email secret is an allegation that Google's CEO, Eric Schmidt, labeled a single email 
discussing Google's agreements with both eBay and Microsoft with the words ""DO NOT FORWARD."" See FAC ¶ 89. The DOJ 
ultimately brought lawsuits alleging antitrust violations against Google and eBay, but not against Microsoft. See ECF No. 70. "
2126,8," To the contrary, the purported allegations of efforts [**55]  by Microsoft to keep information about the Hands-Off List secret 
more closely resembles the allegations in the original Animation Workers complaint, which this Court dismissed without 
prejudice in In re Animation Workers Antitrust Litig. (""Animation Workers I""), 87 F. Supp. 3d 1195 (N.D. Cal. 2015). In Animation 
Workers I, this Court found insufficient to plead affirmative concealment the Animation Workers I plaintiffs' allegations ""that [the 
defendants'] senior human resources directors and senior management discussed the conspiracy in small in-person group 
meetings, avoided memorializing the scheme in writing, and attempted to keep the conspiracy secret from [the plaintiffs]."" 87 F. 
Supp. 3d at 1215. The Court acknowledged that the Animation Workers I plaintiffs had made ""detailed allegations of when and 
where certain Defendants met and conspired,"" but the Court concluded that these allegations showed only that the defendants 
""engaged in a conspiracy, that 'by nature [is] self-concealing.'"" Id. (quoting Conmar, 858 F.2d at 505). The Court concluded that 
the plaintiffs failed ""to aver any affirmative attempts to mislead 'above and beyond' the existence of the conspiracy itself,"" and 
thus the secretive conduct alleged amounted to merely passive concealment. Id. [**56]  (citing Conmar, 858 F.2d at 505). So too 
here, the fact that the Hands-Off List that embodied Microsoft's alleged conspiratorial conduct was not distributed does not show 
conduct ""above and beyond"" the existence of the alleged conspiracy itself. The Court dismissed the complaint in Animation 
Workers I on April 3, 2015, over a month before Plaintiffs filed their First Amended Complaint in the instant case. "
2128,9," Other courts have found that misleading statements constitute affirmative acts of fraudulent concealment only if Plaintiffs allege 
actual reliance upon the allegedly misleading statements. See Block v. Toyota Motor Corp., 5 F. Supp. 3d 1047, 1061 (D. Minn. 
2014) (finding no fraudulent concealment based on allegedly false public statements where plaintiffs did not show that [**63]  
they were aware of the public statements); In re Magnesium Oxide Antitrust Litig., 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 121373, 2011 WL 
5008090, at *23 (D.N.J. Oct. 20, 2011) (""Implicit in the notion that a plaintiff's inquiry was misled or relaxed by an act of 
concealment is that the plaintiff relied on that act of concealment. . . . Here, Plaintiffs make no allegations that they were misled 
by Defendants' concealment of the alleged conspiracy and therefore have failed to meet the second element of fraudulent 
concealment.""). In the instant case, Plaintiffs have not alleged that they read or were aware of Microsoft's Form 10-K SEC filings, 
let alone that they relied upon any statements made in the Form 10-K filings. See FAC at 86. Though the Court need not resolve 
whether Plaintiffs must allege actual reliance, the Court is skeptical that Plaintiffs could satisfy any such actual reliance 
requirement. "
2139,1," Unless otherwise noted, all allegations are taken from the complaint. (See Doc. No. 1.) "
2140,2," SCE is one of CAISO's largest PTOs, along with San Diego Gas & Electric Company (""SDG&E"") and Pacific Gas & Electric

2140,4," Paragraph 152 of the complaint is the only place in which IID alleges its prospective MIC was set at 1700 MW. All other 
references to IID's prospective MIC refer to it as 1400 MW. (See, e.g., Doc. No. 1 ¶¶ 97, 100, 116, 128, 141, 158, 169.) "
2142,5," HN7[

quotation marks omitted). "
2144,6," The Court is cognizant that it must assume the truth of the complaint's allegations when ruling on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion. 
Cahill, 80 F.3d at 337-38. The Court makes this assumption, notwithstanding IID's allegations to the contrary, (see Doc. No. 1 ¶¶ 
162-63), only to illustrate why IID's claims must fail to the extent they are based on an alleged contract. At its heart, such claims 
seek to do what cannot be done under the filed rate doctrine, that is, to obtain a specific allocation to which IID is not entitled 
under CAISO's tariff. See TANC, 295 F.3d at 930-31, 933 (holding the filed rate doctrine applicable because to do otherwise 
""would necessarily assume that, but for [defendant's] alleged fraud, FERC would have made a specific allocation of electricity to 
[plaintiff]""). "
2145,7," IID also insinuates the Court may not consider CAISO's tariff at all because CAISO did not request ""judicial notice of the tariff, 
and the tariff is not before the Court."" (Doc. No. 18 at 9-10.) The Court agrees with CAISO, (see Doc. No. 20 at 6 n.1), that 
judicial notice is not required because the tariff is filed with FERC and is therefore ""the equivalent of a federal regulation."" 
Dynegy, 375 F.3d at 839 (internal citations omitted). Furthermore, even if judicial notice of CAISO's tariff is required, the Court 
concludes it is the proper subject of such notice. HN12[
] ""The court may judicially notice a fact that is not subject to 
reasonable dispute because it: (1) is generally known within the trial court's territorial jurisdiction; or (2) can be accurately and 
readily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned."" Fed. R. Evid. 201(b). CAISO's tariff, filed 
with and approved by FERC, clearly meets the second prong of the test. Furthermore, [**23]  CAISO's HN13[
] failure to request judicial notice does not affect the Court's ability to do so sua sponte. See Fed. R. Evid. 201(c)(1) (stating the Court ""may 
take judicial notice on its own""). "
2146,8," Permitting IID's claims to go forward on this basis, despite its claim of entitlement to a specific allocation of transmission 
capacity, does not run afoul of TANC. That case concerned TANC's claim of entitlement to the California Oregon Intertie's 
transmission capacity absent the megawatt-for-megawatt reduction that the Alturas Intertie caused, which FERC rejected. See 
TANC, 295 F.3d at 923. Here, a claim of miscalculation of prospective MIC is, at its heart, a claim that IID is not receiving the 
MIC that FERC approved via its approval of CAISO's tariff."
2146,9," Because the Court concludes the filed rate doctrine does not apply to the extent IID alleges CAISO miscalculated its MIC, the 
Court need not reach IID's final argument that the competitor exception applies. However, even if the [**26]  Court were to reach 
that argument, the Court agrees with CAISO that it does not apply to the instant matter. The Ninth Circuit in Cost Management 
Services, Inc. v. Washington Natural Gas Co. recognized an exception to the filed rate doctrine, concluding the doctrine is 
inapplicable to ""rate-related suits brought by competitors, as opposed to customers, of regulated entities."" 99 F.3d 937, 943-45, 
948 (9th Cir. 1996). However, the exception's application makes sense only if limited to situations where the plaintiff is damaged 
in its competitor role. See Utilimax.com, Inc. v. PPL Energy Plus, LLC, 378 F.3d 303, 308 (3d Cir. 2004) (""While the ramifications 
were felt in its competitor role, the damage to [plaintiff] occurred because of its status as a customer of [defendant].""). Like the 
plaintiff in Utilimax.com, Inc., while IID may have felt the ramifications of CAISO's alleged anticompetitive behavior in its capacity 
as a competitor, that is, IID's ability to reach customers on CAISO's grid, IID's alleged damage occurred in its status as a 
customer of CAISO's electric transmission services. Surely, access to CAISO's grid is not without cost. (See Doc. No. 18 at 25) 
(""CAISO and IID had a voluntary relationship whereby each received fees for transmission services and transmission operation 
services [**27]  derived from the transmission of electricity between one another's [BAA]""). Such an understanding of the parties' 
relationship is consistent with IID's complaint that CAISO impermissibly used IID's grid without compensation. (See Doc. No. 1 
¶¶ 168, 203-05.)"
2146,10," IID points out that ""CAISO does not assert that IID's federal claims under [ § ] 2 of the Sherman Act are preempted."" (Doc. No. 
18 at 16.) However,HN15[
]  the doctrine of preemption governs the interplay between federal law and state law, not 
competing federal statutes. See TANC, 295 F.3d at 928 (""Federal preemption of state law is rooted in the Supremacy Clause, 
Article VI, clause 2, of the United States Constitution."") (emphasis added). The [**28]  latter relationship is properly governed by 
the ""cardinal principle of construction . . . [that w]hen there are two [federal] acts upon the same subject, the rule is to give effect 
to both if possible."" United States v. Borden Co., 308 U.S. 188, 198, 60 S. Ct. 182, 84 L. Ed. 181 (1939) (internal citations 
omitted). Accordingly, the Court will not address whether IID's federal claims survive preemption. "
2147,11," As discussed above, the Court rejects IID's argument that FERC has no jurisdiction over antitrust claims. See supra 
Discussion Section I.A. "
2148,12," As IID's federal antitrust claims are the only claims to survive the Court's analysis of the filed rate doctrine, preemption, and 
primary jurisdiction, the Court will consider only arguments concerning those claims. "
2150,13," IID relies on Snake River Valley Elec. Ass'n v. PacifiCorp, 357 F.3d 1042 (9th Cir. 2004) [hereinafter Snake River], to support 
its position that it has sufficiently stated an essential facilities claim. (See Doc. No. 18 at 26-27.) That case does not require a 
contrary conclusion. In Snake River, the Ninth Circuit noted the dispositive factors to the Supreme Court's finding of antitrust 
liability in Otter Tail, 410 U.S. 366, 93 S. Ct. 1022, 35 L. Ed. 2d 359 (1973), were the defendant's monopoly power coupled with 
its refusal to ""wheel,"" or transmit, wholesale power over its transmission lines. Snake River, 357 F.3d at 1051. IID 
extrapolates [**39]  from Snake River and Otter Tail to conclude that CAISO, which allegedly enjoys monopoly power over 
electric transmission services in California, should likewise be accountable for antitrust liability. Not so. The case at bar differs 
from Snake River and Otter Tail in a significant respect: the defendants in those cases wholly refused to wheel the plaintiff's 
wholesale power. See Otter Tail, 410 U.S. at 371; Snake River, 357 F.3d at 1045. Here, CAISO will continue to wheel 462 MW 
of IID's power. To the extent it is entitled to more import capacity under CAISO's tariff, IID should seek relief from FERC, a 
federal entity with the power ""to compel sharing and to regulate its scope and terms."" Trinko, 540 U.S. at 411."
2150,14," IID itself identified CAISO's alleged exclusionary conduct as ""Essential Facility, Refusal to Deal, and Leveraging."" (Doc. No. 1 
¶¶ 84-85.) See also Snake River, 357 F.3d at 1044 n.2 (defining essential facilities as encompassing leveraging, stating it 
""applies to a competitor's refusal to deal when the competitor has monopolistic control over an essential facility in one market 
and uses that monopoly power to leverage returns from different markets by refusing to share access to the essential facility"") 
(emphasis added). "
2151,15," CAISO also attacks IID's allegation of antitrust injury on the basis that it has not sufficiently alleged they are competitors. (Doc. 
No. 16-1 at 26-27.) The Court agrees it is far from clear how the parties compete in either of the identified markets. See supra 
Discussion Section I.B.3 n.8. IID identifies the relevant geographic parameters of each market as the State of California. (Doc. 
No. [**43]  1 ¶¶ 75-76.) Yet, in the transmission service market, IID alleges each balancing authority ""operates the transmission 
system that transmits electric energy within its BAA."" (Id. ¶¶ 48, 60) (emphasis added). Similarly, in the transmission operations 
services market, IID alleges the balancing authorities ""perform services within their BAAs . . . ."" (Id. ¶ 74) (emphasis added). 
Given that each balancing authority operates exclusively within their own BAAs, it would appear, to the extent the entities require 
access to the other's grid, that each is a customer of the other, not a competitor. See supra Discussion Section I.B.3 n.8. This is 
consistent with IID's allegations that it has been injured by CAISO's uncompensated use of IID's grid. (See Doc. No. 18 at 25) 
(""CAISO and IID had a voluntary relationship whereby each received fees for transmission services and transmission operation 
services derived from the transmission of electricity between one another's [BAA]""). (Cf. Doc. No. 1 ¶¶ 168, 203-05) (alleging 
CAISO used IID's transmission grid to import substantial out-of-state power without compensation to IID). However, that does 
not end the inquiry. As CAISO acknowledges,HN25[
]  ""only a plaintiff [**44]  that participates as a competitor or a consumer in 
the relevant market can suffer antitrust injury."" (Doc. No. 26) (citing Somers v. Apple, Inc., 729 F.3d 953, 963 (9th Cir. 2013)) 
(emphasis added). IID's apparent status as a consumer of CAISO's electric transmission services therefore does not foreclose 
its ability to allege antitrust injury. "
2161,1," Interrogatory Number 4 asked, ""Did one or more steel mills refuse to sell steel plate to MM Steel as a result of the conspiracy 
thereby denying it access to a supply of steel plate necessary for it to compete effectively?"" Although the jury answered in the 
affirmative, because this question did not specifically ask the jury to consider each manufacturer separately (as Interrogatory 
Number 3 did), clarity is lacking. "
2163,2," AmAlloy threatened JSW on September 19, 2011, and Chapel threatened JSW on October 4. The horizontal conspiracy and 
group boycott between these distributors was confected at the meeting between AmAlloy and JSW [**16]  on September 8, 
2011; as described in MM's brief to this court, ""the first business between the companies since Matt and Mike left AmAlloy in 
1999, [signaling] a wholesale change in their relationship."""
2163,3," Earlier that day, a Chapel representative visited Nucor with another customer, and according to Nucor's Whiteman, the 
representative was busy with phone calls due to a development at Chapel's Houston office. That interaction led Whiteman to 
refer to MM's formation as ""the crisis"" in his email to Altman. MM did not present any evidence showing that the Chapel 
representative discussed MM during the visit on September 1."
2163,4," Notably, the cross-examination of JSW's President Fitch elicited knowledge of raw threats from both Chapel and AmAlloy. The 
cross-examination of Nucor's President Whiteman did not reveal any knowledge of the alleged threat from Chapel. "
2164,5, MM did not present any evidence showing that Chapel and AmAlloy communicated regarding MM before this meeting.
2164,6," Again, MM's sole theory of liability was that Nucor joined the horizontal conspiracy and was thus per se liable for antitrust 
violations. We do not address whether this evidence would be sufficient to establish that Nucor and Chapel entered into a 
vertical refusal to deal agreement that could be held unlawful under the rule of reason. See NYNEX Corp. v. Discon, Inc., 525 
U.S. 128, 136, 119 S. Ct. 493, 142 L. Ed. 2d 510 (1998); see also In re Ins. Brokerage Antitrust Litig., 618 F.3d 300, 317 (3d Cir. 
2010) (""While pleading exclusively per se violations can lighten a plaintiff's litigation burdens, it is not a riskless strategy. If the 
court determines that the restraint at issue is sufficiently different from the per se archetypes to require application of the rule of 
reason, the plaintiff's claims will be dismissed.""). "
2165,7," That a group boycott organized by a cooperative or professional organization is analyzed under the rule of reason unless the 
plaintiff can show that the cooperative or professional organization possessed ""market power or exclusive access to an element 
essential to effective competition"" has no bearing on this case as it does not involve a cooperative or a professional organization.

2166,8," These factors were: ""(1) [**30]  whether the casinos hold a dominant position in the relevant market; (2) whether the casinos

2225,2," Dial Complete's active ingredient is a compound known as triclosan. (See Def.'s Br. in Opp. to Class Certification (document 
no. 86) p. 5; see also Consolidated Class Action Compl. ¶ 35.) "
2226,3," After being pressed by Dial, plaintiffs indicated that they will identify class members through a testimonial claims form 
administrative process. (See Pls.' Reply Br. in Supp. of Mot. for Class Certification (document no. 161) at p. 37.) At oral 
argument on the plaintiffs' class certification motion, counsel for the plaintiffs further indicated that the plaintiffs were working with 
expert consultants to potentially mine consumer data from retailers that would further allow for identification of individual class 
members. (See 4/16/2015 Hearing Tr. at 11-13.) "
2228,4," As the Seventh Circuit points out in Mullins, 795 F.3d at 661: [the] Third Circuit's innovation began with Marcus v. BMW of North America, LLC, 687 F.3d 583 (3d Cir. 2012), where the 
court vacated certification of a poorly defined class. The decisive portion of the opinion, id. at 592-594, certainly seems 
sound, but the opinion went on to caution that on remand, if defendants' records would not identify class members, the 
district court should not approve a method relying on ""potential class members' say so,"" and the opinion said that reliance 
on class members' affidavits might not be ""proper or just,"" id. at 594 (internal quotation marks omitted). The opinion did not 
explain this new requirement other than to cite an easily distinguishable district court decision."
2228,5," In a footnote in Nexium, the court did distinguish the affidavits proposed in that case (""affidavits concerning likely future 
purchases of the consumers, as to which documents are not available"") from ""affidavits concerning the past purchase of the 
product in question."" Id. at 21, n.17. However, such a distinction has little consequence in the consumer products class action "
2229,," context, because most consumers do not save receipts for small purchases, and so, ""documents are not [generally] available,"" 
id. (emphasis added), to establish class membership. "
2231,6," As the court explained in Donovan, ""what [the defendant] complains of is a potential administrative burden in determining who 
is a class member, but this issue is 'primarily one of manageability, and not ascertainability.'"" Donovan v. Philip Morris USA, Inc., 
268 F.R.D. 1, 9 (D. Mass. 2010); see also Mullins, 795 F.3d at 663 (""concern about administrative inconvenience is better 
addressed by the explicit requirements [**25]  of Rule 23(b)(3), which requires that the class device be 'superior to other 
available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.' One relevant factor is 'the likely difficulties in managing a 
class action.'"") (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3)(D)). Thus, Dial's further concerns about individual issues of reliance, causation, 
and damages will be addressed in the court's consideration of the Rule 23(b)(3) factors of predominance and superiority below. "
2233,7," Moreover, as the plaintiffs point out, one of Dial's arguments against certification is that few, if any, potential class members will 
have retained their receipts for purchases of Dial Complete or substitute products. Thus, to the extent that spoliation might 
conceivably be thought an issue, it ultimately becomes a common defense to the class claims rather than a unique individual 
defense. "
2235,8," To the extent spoliation is an issue raised by Dial, as pointed out in the typicality analysis above, it is better thought of as a 
likely defense common to most, if not all, of the named plaintiffs and potential class members. That militates in favor of finding 
that common issues predominate. See Smilow, 323 F.3d at 39 (""Courts traditionally have been reluctant to deny class action 
status under Rule 23(b)(3) simply because affirmative defenses may be available against individual members.""). "
2236,9," The case law on this topic is far from clear. For example, the federal district court in Jarrett v. Panasonic Corp. Of N. Am., 8 F. 
Supp. 3d 1074, 1089 (E.D. Ark. 2013), held that an ""ADTPA claim requires each class member to prove reliance on the allegedly 
fraudulent conduct and that such fraudulent conduct caused damage."" However, the case relied upon in Jarrett, and relied upon 
by Dial in support of its argument, White v. Volkswagen Grp. of Am., Inc.,2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25238, 2013 WL 685298, at *8-
9, simply does not stand for that proposition. In White, the court was considering whether the plaintiff had adequately pled 
an [**42]  ADPTA claim for Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) purposes, not whether the ADPTA requires each individual class member to 
prove reliance. "
2237,10," In support of its argument that individual proof of causation is required, Dial cites to Boshears v. Certainteed Corp., No. 
4:05CV01052-WRW, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3433, 2007 WL 1381652, at *3 (E.D. Ark. May 10, 2007). Boshears is of no 
assistance in resolving the issue, as it involved an individual litigant, not a class action, and contains no substantive discussion 
of the cause of action's causation requirement. Dial also cites to Clayton v. Batesville Casket Co., 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 73853, 
2009 WL 2448164, at *5-6, but Clayton is distinguishable on this point because the court there found that plaintiff had not set 
forth sufficient class-wide proof that the caskets at issue failed, or that conditions of the caskets when purchased caused the 
class members' damages."
2237,11," Generally, the Arkansas Supreme Court has supported a bifurcated approach to class actions, which allows courts to divide a 
case into two phases: (1) certification for resolution of the preliminary, common issues; and (2) decertification for the resolution 
of the individual issues. See General Motors Corp. v. Bryant, 374 Ark. 38, 49, 285 S.W.3d 634 (2008) (observing that 
""challenges based on the statutes of limitations, fraudulent concealment, releases, causation, or reliance have usually been 
rejected and will not bar predominance satisfaction because those issues go to the right of a class member to recover, in 
contrast to underlying common issues of the defendant's liability.""); see also Farmers Union Mut. Ins. Co., 370 S.W.3d at 189 
(""we adhere to our well-settled precedent that allows class actions to be certified first when there are predominating threshold 
issues of liability common to the class, even though there may be individualized issues that come later requiring either the 
creation of subclasses or decertification altogether. [**46]  . . . And, although Appellant asserts that Arkansas 'stands alone' in its 
approach, we have not been presented with any convincing argument that gives us cause to reconsider our prior decisions 
concluding that our approach is what we believe to be the more efficient method.""). "
2238,," Thus, HN21[
] Arkansas law suggests that ""predominance does not fail simply because there are individual issues that may 
arise; the central question to be resolved . . . is whether there are overarching issues that can be addressed before resolving 
individual issues."" GGNSC Arkadelphia, LLC v. Lamb by & through Williams, 465 S.W. at 835. Here, reliance and causation, 
elements of liability, would not preclude certification under Arkansas' certification rules, because those elements lend themselves 
to classwide proof. So, here too, class-wide proof is available and does not preclude certification under federal procedural rules."
2238,12," Dial correctly points out that it made different specific claims about Dial Complete at different points in time. (See Def.'s Br. in 
Opp. to Class Certification (document no. 86) at p. 15.) However, that the exact language Dial used to promote Dial Complete 
was modified over the years does not alter the fact that the message Dial conveyed about Dial Complete was uniform and 
consistent: that Dial Complete provided a greater health benefit to consumers than [**49]  ordinary liquid hand soap. And, that 
allegedly deceptive message is at the core of plaintiffs' claims. That the allegedly deceptive message was worded slightly 
differently over a period of years does not preclude a finding that common issues predominate. Cf. In re NJOY, Inc. Consumer 
Class Action Litig., No. CV1400428MMMJEMX, 120 F. Supp. 3d 1050, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 109133, 2015 WL 4881091, at *34 "

misplaced. Subsequent decisions interpreting California's UCL have stated: ""To the extent the court of appeal's decision in

infant formula produced at a facility where beetles were observed in a batch of finished product. Brandner, 2012 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 7017, 2012 WL 195540, at *1. The court held that to establish proximate cause, the plaintiff would be required to 
establish proof of medical causation, which included both general causation and specific causation. 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7017, 
[WL] at *4. The latter, the court found, would require a highly individualized inquiry, thus defeating the purpose of class 
certification. Id. In the court's view, Brander is distinguishable. However, because the plaintiffs fail to point the court to any 
authority that supports their argument and because the court's own research has not found any persuasive authority, the point is 
forfeited and the court declines to [**70]  certify the Louisiana breach of express warranty claim. "
2246,20," Dial argues that individual issues will predominate because individual proof of causation is required. However, the cases upon 
which Dial relies are distinguishable. In both Brandner v. Abbott Labs., Inc., 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7017, 2012 WL 195540, at 
*9, and Welch v. Atlas Roofing Corp., No. CIV.A. 07-2711, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 81563, 2007 WL 3245444, at *6 (E.D. La. Nov. 
2, 2007), the plaintiffs could not establish that the products [**71]  at issue were uniformly defective for all class members. And, 
at issue in Waters v. Bayer Corp., was an individual plaintiff's failure to effectively establish the causation element of a redhibition 
claim, not whether causation could be effectively established on a classwide basis. No. 01-1819, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 99178, 
2006 WL 725820, at *2 (E.D. La. Mar. 22, 2006). "
2247,21," Dial also relies upon In re BPA Liability Litig., but that case does not support its position either. No. 08-1967-MD-W-ODS, 2011 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 150015, 2011 WL 6740338, at *6 (W.D. Mo. Dec. 22, 2011). The court in In re BPA denied certification of the 
plaintiffs' MMPA claim because the plaintiffs were unable to establish that materiality could be proven on a classwide basis. Id. 
(""just because materiality is an objective inquiry does not mean it is to be determined in a vacuum, especially when the 
undisclosed fact is a scientific debate or controversy.""). Here, in contrast, the evidence in the record is sufficient to support a 
finding that the challenged claims were material. "
2249,22," ""[W]e are required to address the issue [of standing] . . . even if the parties fail to raise the issue before us. The federal courts

2252,24," Indeed, the only case cited by the plaintiffs that actually involves a DTPA claim, K&S Tool & Die Corp. v. Perfection Machinery 
Sales, Inc., 2007 WI 70, 301 Wis. 2d 109, 732 N.W.2d 792, 802 (Wis. 2007), did not involve a class action. And while the court 
in K&S Tool did state that ""plaintiff does not have the burden of proving reasonable reliance"" to establish a DTPA claim, the 
court went on to state: ""the reasonableness of a plaintiff's reliance may be relevant in considering whether the representation 
materially induced the plaintiff's pecuniary loss."" Id. "
2255,25," In support of its argument that there was no premium, and that Dial Complete would have been priced the same with or 
without the claimed germicidal properties, Dial points to its expert's conclusion that Dial Complete did not command a premium 
over competing foaming soaps without similar germicidal claims. (See Def.'s Surreply in Opp. to Class Certification (document 
no. 175) at p. 14.) But on this point, the court finds the report prepared by plaintiffs' experts, Rosen and Burke, persuasive: The term 'premium' is better described as the amount of money consumers pay to acquire a certain attribute of a product. 
Assuming the allegations in this case to be true, [class members] have paid to purchase antibacterial attributes of Dial 
Complete they did not receive, and they have thus been damaged as a result thereof. This is true whether the price of the 
product is higher, lower, or the same as other products without the attribute. The costs of including the anti-bacterial agent 
becomes embodied in the price [**102]  of the product in the same way all other costs such as packaging, advertising[,] etc. 
and are paid for by all class members regardless of the reasons they may have purchased the product. (See Burke and Rosen Rebuttal Report (document no. 162-4) at ¶ 36.) "
2256,26," Burke and Rosen did perform a preliminary analysis comparing the average price of Dial Complete with Dial Gold, a Dial 
product marketed without the challenged claims. But, as Dial's expert notes, Burke and Rosen only ""calculated the price 
difference between Dial Complete and Dial Pump, not an alleged price premium attributable to the Challenged Claims."" (Ugone 
Report [**106]  at p. 26.) Rosen himself testified that such an analysis would not ultimately suffice for calculating damages: Q: Do I understand correctly that you propose to determine damages by calculating the difference between two figures, first 
of all the average retail price of Dial Complete. And second of all, the average retail price of a range of alternative 
competing substitute products? A: Well, first of all, that might not be the only way or the way at all because we have four different methodologies which may 
be employed; however, you're referring to the third methodology on the premium analysis, and it would not be simply taking 
as we did in Exhibit A [to Rosen's Expert Report] where we looked at your marketing report. That was just so I could see 
whether there was any kind of consistent differential or not. It would have to be much more sophisticated than that. (Rosen Dep. 130:2-15.)"
2256,27, The excerpts of Rosen's deposition testimony provided to the court fail to fill in the blanks: 
2257,," Q: You say you were asked to provide methodology. [**108]  But my question actually was whether you have developed a 
methodology. A: Well, there are the methodologies. Q: Right, but I take it- A: Measure purchase price, measure, you know, the wholesale revenues. Q: Right, but you haven't developed any method for applying those general tools to the specific question of whether any 
price premium for Dial Complete is attributable to the challenged class? A: Well, as we said in here, it may very well be some form of regression analysis or something similar Q: Right, but you haven't developed one? A: No. (Rosen Dep. (document no. 86-7) at 182:23-183:14.)"
2257,28," Rosen repeatedly testified that he did not have sufficient data when performing his analyses. (See, e.g., Rosen Dep.

2276,8," The Court acknowledges that divestiture may be a remedy to an antitrust violation, see, e.g., United States v. E.I. du Pont de

antitrust remedies""). At the same time, divestiture is considered a ""far-reaching and drastic remedy."" United States v. Coca-Cola 
Bottling Co., 575 F.2d 222, 229 (9th Cir. 1978). In this case, where Verso has divested itself of an asset by selling it to a non-
competitor, the Plaintiffs have presented the Court with no authority that it should order the non-competitor to divest [**48]  its 
newly acquired asset."
2276,9," As a general proposition, § 7 of the Clayton Act focuses on buyers, not sellers. However, relying on Ninth Circuit authority, the 
United States District Court of New Hampshire observed that ""[i]n certain instances, courts may maintain jurisdiction over entities 
relinquishing assets to allow for the equitable remedy of rescission."" Goss Int'l, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27191, 2005 WL 2998531, 
at *4 (citing Coca-Cola, 575 F.2d at 229). The Coca-Cola Court conducted an interlocutory review to decide whether rescission 
is available as a remedy in § 7 cases. Coca-Cola, 575 F.2d at 227. The Ninth Circuit perceived a congressional intent to bind 
""third parties"" whose conduct was ""so related to the anti-competitive effects at which the act was directed . . . ."" Id. at 228. Thus, 
it ruled that ""rescission is not without the pale of equitable discretion in appropriate circumstances,"" though ""[t]he fact that sellers 
in [§] 7 cases are not technical violators of the law is itself a strong equity consideration against rescission."" Id. at 230. Shortly 
after the Ninth Circuit decided Coca-Cola, another court interpreted that decision as ""merely stand[ing] for the proposition that a 
court can maintain as a Clayton [§] 7 defendant any party whose presence is necessary to effectuate relief."" Palmer News, Inc. 
v. ARA Servs., Inc., 476 F. Supp. 1176, 1193 (D. Kan. 1979). The general proposition holds on these facts. "
2277,," The Court [**49]  assumes that it would have the power to rescind the Verso-AIM contract if necessary to do so to ""eliminate the 
effects of an acquisition offensive to the statute."" Coca-Cola, 575 F.2d at 229 (citations omitted). In the unusual case in which a 
court decides to exercise jurisdiction over a seller, it must first find an anticompetitive conduct to remedy. Here, however, the 
Court can discern no recognized theory of such conduct on the facts before it. Thus, it is without a basis on which to conclude 
that the transaction at issue—i.e., the sale of the mill to a noncompetitor—is the sort of anticompetitive conduct calling for a 
remedy under § 7 of the Clayton Act. "

2286,2," Because I will grant the Generic Defendants' motion on the basis that Plaintiffs' per se theory is contrary to Actavis, I need not 
address the Generic Defendants' alternate argument that the Seventh Amendment protects their right to fully litigate any issues 
relating to materiality in the event that Plaintiffs' knowledge of fraud theory is permitted at trial. (See Defs.' Mot. to Strike, pp. 12-
17.)"
2286,3," Additional details regarding these settlement agreements and the Hatch-Waxman administrative framework may be found at 
this Court's memorandum opinion addressing Defendants' motions for summary judgment on Plaintiffs' Actavis claims. See King 
Drug Co. of Florence, Inc. v. Cephalon, Inc., 88 F. Supp. 3d 402 (E.D. Pa. 2015). "
2287,4," The Generic Defendants also assert that Plaintiffs did not timely plead or disclose this theory of liability. However, upon review 
of Plaintiffs' complaints, as well as numerous briefs filed in connection with the parties' motions for summary judgment, it is clear 
that this theory of liability has been raised and briefed by the parties throughout the course of this litigation. (See DPCP 2d Am. 
Compl. PP 72-82; Rite Aid Compl. PP 68-70; Walgreens [*30]  Am. Compl. PP 71-73; EP Am. Compl. PP 71-83; Apotex 2d Am.

Generic Defendants' argument that they were not put on notice of Plaintiffs' per se theory of liability. "
2288,5," Plaintiffs' per se theory of liability was briefed at the time of summary judgment. In my Opinion denying Defendants' motions for 
summary judgment on the antitrust challenges to the settlement agreements, I characterized Plaintiffs' knowledge of fraud 
argument as follows: The private Plaintiffs argue that even if they do not satisfy their burden under Actavis, summary judgment may not be 
granted on their challenges to the settlement agreements due to their allegations of fraud in the procurement of Cephalon's 
patent. They assert that proof of Walker Process fraud renders the settlement agreements per se violations of the Sherman 
Act, and thus, evidence of fraud is sufficient to deny [*33]  summary judgment. The Generic Defendants respond that they 
may not be held liable under the antitrust laws for Cephalon's fraud. King Drug Co. of Florence, Inc. v. Cephalon, Inc., 88 F. Supp. 3d 402, 414 n.12 (E.D. Pa. 2015). At that time, I declined to 
resolve whether knowledge of fraud could be used to hold the Generic Defendants per se liable because Plaintiffs had presented 
sufficient evidence to survive summary judgment under the Actavis framework. Id. "
2290,6," At the time of the reverse-payment settlements, no final judgment regarding the fraud allegations had been reached in the 
Paragraph IV litigation. I take no position as to the appropriate legal standard for a case where parties to Hatch-Waxman 
Paragraph IV litigation settle after a judicial determination of fraud has been entered. "

2292,8," While Plaintiffs cite to certain statements in United States v. Singer Mfg. Co., 374 U.S. 174, 83 S. Ct. 1773, 10 L. Ed. 2d 823, 
1963 Dec. Comm'r Pat. 547 (1963) in support of their per se theory of liability, those statements are derived from Justice White's 
concurrence and were not adopted by the Singer majority. Therefore, I do not find this argument convincing."
2292,9," This issue regarding a per se theory of liability based on the Generic Defendants' knowledge of Cephalon's fraud has also 
arisen in the context of the Direct Purchasers' motion to amend my class certification Order and for approval of the form and 
manner of notice to the Direct Purchaser Class. (See Dkt. No. 06-1797, Doc. No. 844.) For all of the reasons recited herein, 
including allegations of the Generic Defendants' knowledge of fraud in the class notice would be equally inappropriate. "
2293,10," To support their argument, Plaintiffs refer to my ruling in Federal Trade Commission v. Cephalon, Inc., No. 08-2141, a case 
consolidated in the In re Modafinil Antitrust Litigation that has settled. In resolving the FTC's motion for partial summary 
judgment based on my findings in the patent trial, I determined that ""basic principles of agency law, which holds that a 
corporation is charged with the knowledge of acts done by its agents acting within the scope of their employment"" prevented 
Cephalon from asserting that it did not know that the patent was fraudulent at the time of the reverse-payment settlements. 
Federal Trade Commission v. Cephalon, Inc., 36 F. Supp. 3d 527, 535-36 (E.D. Pa. 2014). As the Generic Defendants were not 
employees of Cephalon, nor were they in any way involved in the procurement of the RE '516 patent, my holding in FTC is of 
limited relevance here. "
2294,11," The Direct Purchasers have insisted on numerous occasions that I did not conclusively decide in the collateral estoppel 
Opinion whether partial summary judgment should be entered against Cephalon and the Generic Defendants on the invalidity of 
the RE '516 patent and Walker Process materiality. (See, e.g., DP Resp., pp. 17-18.) While I believe my rulings are clear, in 
deference to counsel for the Direct Purchasers, I will attempt to clarify. Partial summary judgment has been granted in favor of Plaintiffs [*52]  against Cephalon as to Walker Process materiality. King 
Drug Co. of Florence, Inc., 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 32508, 2014 WL 982848, at *12 (finding that collateral estoppel applies to 
invalidity rulings of derivation, obviousness and on-sale bar and that Walker Process materiality is established as to Cephalon). 
However, because a Walker Process claim had not been pled as to the Generic Defendants (nor was there any evidence to 
support a finding of Walker Process fraud as to these Defendants), collateral estoppel as to invalidity did not conclusively 
establish any element of any claim brought against the Generics. 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 32508, [WL] at *13 (""validity is not 
identical to any of the claims brought against [Generic Defendants],"" so ""the fact that the patent was found invalid in the 2011 
Apotex patent litigation should have no bearing on the proofs necessary to hold the Generic Defendants liable for antitrust 
violations""). Therefore, summary judgment was denied as to the Generic Defendants. Id. "
