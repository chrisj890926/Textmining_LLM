22,1, The parties have consented to the jurisdiction of a magistrate judge for all purposes pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(c).
22,2," Facebook, Inc. v. BrandTotal Ltd., 499 F. Supp. 3d 720 (N.D. Cal. 2020). Citations herein to previous orders in this case refer 
to page numbers of the versions filed in the Court's ECF docket."
22,3," Facebook, Inc. v. BrandTotal Ltd., No. 20-cv-07182-JCS, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 31558, 2021 WL 662168 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 19, 
2021)."
22,4," Facebook, Inc. v. BrandTotal Ltd., No. 20-cv-07182-JCS, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 108137, 2021 WL 2354751 (N.D. Cal. June 3, 
2021). "
23,5," ""SIEP"" refers to ""social issues, elections or politics."" Facebook provides more public information about SIEP advertisements 
than it provides about to other ads. See SACC ¶ 22. SIEP ads are not directly at issue in this case and are generally not relevant 
to BrandTotal's clients. "
24,6," Facebook also moves to dismiss BrandTotal's counterclaim under the ""unlawful"" prong of the UCL to the extent that it rests on 
the new defamation counterclaim. The parties agree that to the extent that counterclaim is based on the defamation 
counterclaim (as opposed to the tortious interference counterclaims the Court previously allowed to proceed) they rise or fall 
together. See Defs.' Opp'n & Reply at 17. "
27,7," The extent to which BrandTotal intends to pursue a theory based on Facebook's refusal to provide permission to access data is 
unclear. Compare Defs.' Opp'n & Reply at 8 (asserting that Facebook violates the spirit of the antitrust laws by ""using the FTC 
Order to gain a competitive advantage by intentionally refusing to provide permission to any entity that seeks to collect Third-
Party Commercial Advertising Information from Facebook's sites""); with id. at 14 (""BrandTotal's SAC presents two theories under 
which Facebook's behavior violates the unfair prong of the UCL. First, BrandTotal alleges Facebook interjects itself into the 
marketplace by petitioning Google to remove applications and extensions that compete with Facebook's advertising services. . . . 
Second, BrandTotal alleges Facebook stifles competition by punishing entities by removing the business and personal account 
pages of its competition and their principals and employees.""). Despite BrandTotal's assertion that it ""is not asking Facebook to 
authorize BrandTotal's access,"" id. at 14, the Court addresses in an abundance of caution BrandTotal's allegation that failure to 
authorize such access is anticompetitive, see id. at 8; SACC ¶ 155. "
29,8," BrandTotal argues that its claims based on deactivation of accounts and refusal to permit advertising fall within the Aspen 
Skiing exception to the refusal-to-deal doctrine, which requires three elements: (1) unilateral termination of a voluntary and 
profitable course of dealing; (2) that could only be intended to sacrifice short-term benefits for long-term monopolist profits; (3) 
involving products already sold to other similarly situated customers. See Qualcomm, 969 F.3d at 994-95. Here, Facebook 
purportedly terminated BrandTotal's accounts and advertising based on BrandTotal's violation of Facebook's terms of service, 
including a prohibition of automated data collection without Facebook's permission. Given a party's general right to refuse to deal 
from the outset, it seems likely that a party may set conditions on such dealing and enforce those conditions if violated by 
terminating the relationship. The parties have not addressed that question in detail, however, and the Court need not resolve 
that issue in light of the separate basis for dismissal discussed below. Regardless, the refusal-to-deal doctrine does not apply to 
the extent BrandTotal's claim is based on Facebook's communication with Google. "
31,9," At the hearing, BrandTotal cited its allegation that Facebook has taken similar actions against at least six other entities. See 
SACC ¶ 164. That allegations says nothing about Facebook's position in the market for the advertising information at issue, or 
whether other competitors exist that have not been subject to any such action by Facebook, or whether other competitors have 
been able to compete successfully despite Facebook taking similar action. "
35,1," At the time the motion was filed, several individual doctors were also defendants in the case and signed onto the motion, 
including Dr. Gary P. Wormser, Dr. Allen Steere, Dr. Raymond J. Dattwyler, Dr. John J. Halperin, Dr. Eugene Shapiro and Dr. 
Leonard Sigal (collectively, the ""Doctors""). They have since been dismissed from the case. Docket No. 396."
35,2," Plaintiffs also sued the insurance providers Anthem, Inc., Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas, Aetna, Inc., Cigna Health and 
Life Insurance Company (sued as Cigna Corporation), Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc. (sued as Kaiser Permanente, Inc.), 
United Healthcare Services, Inc., Unitedhealth Group Inc. and Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association (collectively, the 
""Insurance Defendants""). At this time, the suit against these parties has either been stayed for notice of settlement or dismissed. "
38,3," Discovery closed in this matter on January 15, 2021. Docket No. 376. The instant motion for summary judgment motion was 
filed on February 3, 2021. Docket No. 357. In response to summary judgment, for the first time, Plaintiffs allege that evidence 
was destroyed; they did not, however, file a motion to compel at that point. Defendant raised this in its reply on March 16, and at 
oral argument on April 23, the Court questioned Plaintiffs about their failure to move on the alleged discovery dispute. Docket 
No. 405 at 34:5-14. Only after that, on May 3, did Plaintiffs file a motion to compel. Docket No. 402. That is too late. See, Lectec 
Corp. v. Chattem, Inc., No. 5:08-CV-130, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 156898, 2011 WL 13085199, at *2 (E.D. Tex. January 4, 2011) 
(Folsom, J.) (""Plaintiff has not shown that it moved to compel production from [Defendant], however, so Plaintiff cannot now rely 
on any purported discovery misconduct to compensate for a deficiency in Plaintiff's evidence.""). Moreover, Plaintiffs provide no evidence to support their allegation that Defendant has not met its discovery obligations in this 
case. The parties agreed on the scope of the subject matter that would be searched for—and relevant to this issue—and that 
scope was limited to evidence of payments from the Insurance Defendants. See Docket No. 181 ¶ I.2 (""For all Defendants, 
copies of payments, checks, wire transfers, or other documents sufficient to show any consulting payments by the insurance 
defendants to the doctor defendants and/or Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA[]) related to Lyme disease. These 
documents would not include payments made for claims for the provision of medical services to patients by the doctor 
defendants.""). Work that a doctor has done with other disability or medical malpractice insurance companies is irrelevant to the 
Plaintiffs' allegations in this suit and does not support Plaintiffs' speculation that documents were not produced. "
40,4, Plaintiffs further assert that Defendant said nothing about Plaintiffs' Section 2 antitrust claim. Id. at 24. 
42,5," The Fifth Circuit has held that in antitrust cases ""[w]e no longer maintain that summary judgment is especially disfavored in 
categories of cases. Stearns' attempt to invoke earlier cases in which we suggested that summary judgment should be shunned 
when complex antitrust claims are involved thus fails."" Stearns Airport Equip. Co. v. FMC Corp., 170 F.3d 518, 521 (5th Cir. 
1999) (citation omitted). "
48,1," The complaint refers to the ""segregation rule"" or ""IDX segregation rule,"" e.g., Compl. at ¶¶ 85 & 93, but the parties, and the 
Court's prior order (docket no. 80), have also referred to this rule as the No-Commingling Rule. This order will refer to the rule as 
the Segregation Rule. "
52,2," The parties do not separately brief Plaintiff's state law claim for conspiracy to restrain trade under the CPA, RCW 19.86.030, 
and Zillow argues that this claim should be dismissed on the same basis that the Section 1 claim should be dismissed. See 
Zillow Mot. (docket no. 83 at 20-21). The Court recognizes that the state and federal standards are essentially the same and 
thus analyzes both claims under the federal standards. See State v. LG Elecs., Inc., 186 Wn.2d 169, 186 n.3, 375 P.3d 1035 
(2016) (concurring, McCloud, J.)."
52,3," Although the complaint alleges a ""group boycott,"" it is clear from the face of the complaint that Defendants are not alleged to be 
competitors who refuse to do business with Plaintiff—but rather, they are alleged to have ""segregate[d]"" Plaintiff's listings, 
""denying them effective"" or ""equal"" access to Zillow's websites. Compl. at ¶¶ 101, 109, 118 & 122. See Boycott, BLACK'S LAW 
DICTIONARY (11th ed. 2019) (defining ""group boycott"" as ""[a] type of secondary boycott by two or more competitors who refuse 
to do business with one firm unless it refrains from doing business with an actual or potential competitor of the boycotters,"" and 
noting that such claims are ""analyzed under either the per se rule or the rule of reason, depending on the nature of the boycott"")."
52,4," Neither Defendant appears to challenge Plaintiff's alleged harm or so-called antitrust standing to bring this action. Although 
NAR argues (unsuccessfully) that Plaintiff lacks constitutional standing, see supra, Section 1 of this Order, and suggests that 
Plaintiff also lacks standing to bring an antitrust action, NAR confines its argument to the complaint's purported failure to plead 
harm to competition—rather than any failure to plead harm to Plaintiff as a result of Defendants' anticompetitive conduct. See 
NAR Mot. (docket no. 84 at 13-15). The Court concludes that Plaintiff has adequately pleaded that it has suffered harm as a 
result of the anticompetitive aspects of Defendants' actions. See Compl. at ¶¶ 73 & 111. "
53,5," HN7[
] This circuit has adopted a three-part, burden-shifting test, under which a plaintiff must meet this initial burden and only 
""then the burden shifts to the defendant to show a procompetitive rationale for the restraint."" Qualcomm, 969 F.3d at 991. ""If the 
defendant makes this showing, then the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to demonstrate the procompetitive efficiencies could 
reasonably be achieved through less anticompetitive means."" Id. In ruling on a 12(b)(6) motion, the Court exclusively focuses on 
whether Plaintiff has sufficiently pleaded the first element. See Sitzer v. Nat'l Assoc. of Realtors, 420 F. Supp. 3d 903, 915 (W.D. 
Mo. 2019) (concluding that at the motion to dismiss stage, ""the [c]ourt's job is not to balance the anticompetitive effects of [the 
challenged restraints] against procompetitive justifications,"" but instead to ""evaluate whether [the complaint] presents facts, 
which . . . show the challenged conduct plausibly exerts an unreasonable restraint on trade""). "
54,6," NAR also argues that the relevant market alleged in the complaint is ""implausible"" because it fails to include individuals who 
""provide real estate brokerage services to themselves,"" or other reasonable substitutes. See NAR Mot. (docket no. 84 at 17). 
The complaint alleges that ""Zillow and NAR are . . . harming the sellers of the[] homes"" that are listed on the ""Other listings"" tab, 
including ""For Sale by Owner"" listings. Id. at ¶¶ 73 & 77. The complaint clearly alleges harm to individuals who sell their homes 
themselves, as well as those who use non-MLS brokers like Plaintiff. "
55,7," In Vernon, this Court did not apply Rule 9(b) to the plaintiffs' CPA claim because the plaintiffs did ""not allege[] facts that 
constitute fraud and the gravamen of the complaint [was] not fraud."" 643 F. Supp. 2d at 1265. That case is distinguishable from 
the instant case for the reasons explained in this Section. "
56,8," The Court nevertheless concludes that Plaintiff has failed to state a Lanham Act claim against NAR under the less demanding 
pleading requirements. See infra, Section 4(C)."
56,9," Although jurists debate whether the second element is still valid in light of the Supreme Court's decision in Lexmark Int'l, Inc. v. 
Static Control Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 134 S. Ct. 1377, 188 L. Ed. 2d 392 (2014), there is no question that the third 
element, the only element at issue in this case, ""flows from the statutory language and remains valid after Lexmark."" Ariix, 985 
F.3d at 1124 (Collins, J., dissenting). "
57,10," Zillow also points to contradictory allegations contained in the complaint, namely that Zillow's decision to join NAR and MLSs, 
and requiring Zillow to change its websites, increased its own costs and negatively impacted its data-aggregation business. 
Zillow Mot. (docket no. 83 at 23) (citing Compl. at ¶¶ 54 & 65). The Court perceives no contradiction: Zillow could plausibly be 
motivated to join NAR and MLSs to boost its Zillow Offers business (and other MLS members' services) irrespective of whether 
that change was costly to implement or ultimately hurt Zillow's data-aggregation business."
57,11," HN14[
] Leave to amend a complaint should be freely given, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2), and at this stage, it is not clear to the Court that an amendment would be futile. See Lopez, 203 F.3d at 1130. "
58,12," The Court expressly does not decide whether Zillow could later prevail on a business purposes defense. See Order (docket 
no. 80 at 21). That determination must await discovery and any further motion practice. "
66,1," The Chinese characters for YeShu (i.e., 椰 树)—which appear on Snack's coconut juice products, the Accused Product, and the Accused Mark-mean coconut palm. (ECF No. 1-2 Ex. B; ECF No. 37 at 7.)"
66,2," Hereinafter, OCM Globe, OCM USA, and OCM NJ are collectively termed the ""OCM Parties."" "
68,3," In addition to trademark infringement and unfair competition, Snack alleges under Count 2 that Defendants made false 
designation of origin and false description regarding the Accused Products by using the Accused Marks, thereby 
misrepresenting the Accused Products' association with Snack or Coconut Palm Group, so that consumers were confused as to 
the source of the Accused Products. (ECF No. 1 ¶ 54.) In other words, Snack's allegations of false designation of origin and 
false description are also directed to the potential passing off with the Accused Products. Such false designation of origin and 
false description also occur when passing off occurs. "

exception 'where claims arise out of the same operative facts.'"" Neopart Transit, LLC v. Mgmt. Consulting, Inc., Civ. A. No. 16-

Snack's claims arose out of the same operative facts, the pendent venue doctrine is triggered."
69,5," ""Although Tefal was decided under an earlier version of 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2) which provided that venue was proper in 'the

remain sealed unless otherwise noted in this Order."
109,2," In considering these issues, the Court conducted a sixteen-day bench trial, admitted over 900 exhibits, and, to expedite the in-
court proceedings, considered pre-trial submissions including written testimony of the experts and designations of deposition 
transcripts. The Court in this Order refers to the findings of facts (""FOF"") and conclusions of law (""COL"") for the parties'

anything but a game store. Indeed, the Court emphasizes that its addition of non-gaming apps during the pendency of this 
litigation (Spotify) and on the eve of trial (the remaining apps and software) do not demonstrate that Epic Games Store is a 
general app store, especially for purposes of this litigation. First, at the time of the filing of the complaint in this action, the Epic Games Store was undisputedly a game store, and the 
pleadings only confirm that Epic Games sought to open Epic Games Store in its then current iteration on the iOS platform. See 
Compl. (Dkt. No. 1) ¶ 27 (""Epic also built and runs the Epic Games Store, a digital video game storefront through which gamers 
can download various games, some developed by Epic, and many offered by third-party game developers."" (emphasis 
supplied)), ¶ 81 (""Epic approached Apple to request that Apple allow Epic to offer its Epic Games Store to Apple's iOS users 
through the App Store and direct installation.""), ¶ 90 (""The Epic Games Store offers personalized features such as friends list 
management and game matchmaking services. Absent Apple's anticompetitive conduct, Epic would also create an app store for 
iOS.""). Second, the Court heard no specific evidence on these newly added apps, beyond brief descriptions of these apps and software, 
including on Epic Games' monetization and revenues from such apps, or even user statistics with respect to such apps, 
including total and relative downloads as compared to other products in the Epic Games Store."

134,219," 5.1.1 Data Collection and Storage: (i) Privacy Policies: All apps must include a link to their privacy policy in the App Store Connect metadata field and within the app 
in an easily accessible manner. The privacy policy must clearly and explicitly: • Identify what data, if any, the app/service collects, how it collects that data, and all uses of that data. • Confirm that any third party with whom an app shares user data (in compliance with these Guidelines) — such as 
analytics tools, advertising networks and third-party SDKs, as well as any parent, subsidiary or other related entities that will 
have access to user data — will provide the same or equal protection of user data as stated in the app's privacy policy and 
required by these Guidelines. • Explain its data retention/deletion policies and describe how a user can revoke consent and/or request deletion of the 
user's data. (ii) Permission Apps that collect user or usage data must secure user consent for the collection, even if such data is considered 
to be anonymous at the time of or immediately following collection. Paid functionality must not be dependent on or require a user 
to grant access to this data. Apps must also provide the customer with an easily accessible and understandable way to withdraw 
consent. Ensure your purpose strings clearly and completely describe your use of the data. Apps that collect data for a legitimate 
interest without consent by relying on the terms of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (""GDPR"") or similar 
statute must comply with all terms of that law. Learn more about Requesting Permission. (iii) Data Minimization: Apps should only request access to data relevant to the core functionality of the app and should only 
collect and use data that is required to accomplish the relevant task. Where possible, use the out-of process picker or a share 
sheet rather than requesting full access to protected resources like Photos or Contacts. (iv) Access: Apps must respect the user's permission settings and not attempt to manipulate, trick, or force people to consent to 
unnecessary data access. For example, apps that include the ability to post photos to a social network must not also require 
microphone access before allowing the user to upload photos. Where possible, provide alternative solutions for users who don't 
grant consent. For example, if a user declines to share Location, offer the ability to manually enter an address. (v) Account Sign-In: If your app doesn't include significant account-based features, let people use it without a log-in. Apps may 
not require users to enter personal information to function, except when directly relevant to the core functionality of the app or 
required by law. If your core app functionality is not related to a specific social network (e.g. Facebook, via another mechanism. 
Pulling basic profile information, sharing to the social network, or inviting friends to use the app are not considered core app 
functionality. The app must also include a mechanism to revoke social network credentials and disable data access between the 
app and social network from within the app. An app may not store credentials or tokens to social networks off of the device and 
may only use such credentials or tokens to directly connect to the social network from the app itself while the app is in use. (vi) Developers that use their apps to surreptitiously discover passwords or other private data will be removed from the 
Developer Program. (vii) SafariViewController must be used to visibly present information to users; the controller may not be hidden or obscured by 
other views or layers. Additionally, an app may not use SafariViewController to track users without their knowledge and consent. (viii) Apps that compile personal information from any source that is not directly from the user or without the user's explicit 
consent, even public databases, are not permitted on the App Store. "
135,," (ix) Apps that provide services in highly-regulated fields (such as banking and financial services, healthcare, gambling, and air 
travel) or that require sensitive user information should be submitted by a legal entity that provides the services, and not by an 
individual developer."
135,5," .1.2 Data Use and Sharing (i) Unless otherwise permitted by law, you may not use, transmit, or share someone's personal data without first obtaining their 
permission. You must provide access to information about how and where the data will be used. Data collected from apps may 
only be shared with third parties to improve the app or serve advertising (in compliance with the Apple Developer Program 
License Agreement.). Apps that share user data without user consent or otherwise complying with data privacy laws may be 
removed from sale and may result in your removal from the Apple Developer Program. (ii) Data collected for one purpose may not be repurposed without further consent unless otherwise explicitly permitted by law. (iii) Apps should not attempt to surreptitiously build a user profile based on collected data and may not attempt, facilitate, or 
encourage others to identify anonymous users or reconstruct user profiles based on data collected from Apple-provided APIs or 
any data that you say has been collected in an ""anonymized,"" ""aggregated,"" or otherwise non-identifiable way."

Apple waived its objections by stipulating to the admission of expert ""written direct testimony"" (Dkt. No. 510) and ""unadmitted 
materials within the scope of Rule 703"" relied on by the experts (Dkt. No. 635). Epic Games further contends that Dr. Athey 
disclosed her opinions in her report and that she may testify ""solely or primarily on experience"" if she ""explain[s] how that 
experience leads to the conclusions reached, why that experience is a sufficient basis for the opinion, and how that experience 
is reliable applied to the facts."" Fed. R. Evid. 702 advisory committee note to 2000 Amendments (""Adv. Committee Note""). "
142,," While the Court does not strike the opinion, the Court agrees with Apple that the opinion's basis is weak. Epic Games conflates 
the requirements of Rule 703, Rule 702, and discovery. HN6[
] Rule 702(b) asks ""whether the expert considered enough information to make the proffered opinion reliable,"" while Rule 703 asks whether the data considered itself is ""of a type that is 
reliable."" See 29 Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure § 6268 (2d ed.). Federal Rule of Civil 
Procedure 26(a)(2)(B)(ii) further requires that an expert set forth ""the facts or data considered by the [expert] in forming"" the 
opinions in her report. Here, Dr. Athey does not explain how her experience provides a sufficient basis for her sweeping conclusions. This is not a 
handwriting case where an expert opines that two writings are the same based on experience. It is a complex antitrust case that 
requires consideration of economic data. Unexplained academic and industry experience simply does not provide sufficient 
basis to draw reliable conclusions. Moreover, to the extent that Epic Games asks the Court to rely on Dr. Athey's general 
research, such research should have been disclosed in the report so that the Court and opposing party could evaluate it. Nevertheless, the Court recognizes that the procedural posture of this case was unique. The Court ordered that no Daubert 
motions be made in advance of the bench trial given the expedited schedule and the fact that the Court had to read and review 
the submission in any event. Context was helpful. That said, many issues were litigated during the course of the bench trial and 
Apple did stipulate to the admission of Dr. Athey's testimony. Dr. Athey apparently relied on additional sources in her expert 
report (which she did not cite in her written direct testimony). The Court considers her opinions, but as discussed, given the lack 
of data, the Court does not give those opinions much weight."
142,264," Last, Dr. Athey describes ""mixing-and-matching"" costs that users incur when trying to use devices from different ecosystems

143,267," Trial. Tr. (Evans) 1509:11-17; Ex. Expert 1 (Evans) ¶ 118.iv. The Court rejects the notion that Apple must affirmatively give

that consumers appear to be in different categories of spending. See Epic Games FOF ¶ 221.a. That is different from enforcing

switching by themselves. See also DX-4312.043; DX-4495.044."

make it easy for Fortnite players to switch devices. Dr. Evans further lowers the substitution estimate after accounting for the 
""natural cross-progression"" from iOS to ""more serious"" gaming on PCs and consoles. However, as Dr. Hitt correctly notes, this 
constitutes substitution even if it is not directly responsive to the quality decrease. Ex. Expert 1 (Evans) ¶ 129; Trial Tr. (Evans)

increase in the amount of Apple's commission rate. The Department of Justice website, which Dr. Evans approvingly cites in his 
report, notes that in cases involving an analogous transaction in oil pipelines, the appropriate SSNIP analysis is based on the 
cost of transporting the oil (amount from the commission rate), not on the cost of the oil at the terminal end point (total cost of the 
in-app-purchases). See Ex. Expert 1 (Evans) ¶ 253, n. 113; see also U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Trade

155,341," For instance, the Court is generally aware that one of the first commercially successful games, Pong, consisted of minimal 
input from the player of moving a paddle up or down. Of course, modern console, computer, and mobile gaming now permit 
dynamic inputs beyond just one input. For instance, modern controllers for gaming consoles now include at least two analog 
sticks, a directional pad (d-pad), and several buttons found on both the front face and side edges of each controller. See 
generally PX-2776 (Nintendo Switch); PX-2777 (Sony PlayStation 5); PX-2778 (Microsoft Xbox Series X)."

technology in rendering graphics and animations in the game."
155,343," Trial Tr. (Allison) 1241:16-1242:18. Although not in the record, the Court generally understands that: (1) The Oregon Trail is a

that The Sims is a life simulation game that simulates general modern life (i.e., socializing, employment, romance, family, skills, 
etc.) through player characters known as sims."
155,344," Of course, many games are also narrative driven as recognized by Mr. Kosmynka. Microsoft's internal review of The Last of 
Us Part II, a Sony PlayStation exclusive video game, confirms that at least some games are focused more on the narrative of the 
game as opposed to the game play itself. See PX-2476.002."

156,354," There was also much discussion about a similar metaverse game, Roblox, which contains creative experiences that are 
similar to those offered in the creative and party modes in Fortnite, and whether it too qualified as a video game. The discussion 
was not initially helped by Mr. Kosmynka, whose self-acknowledged unfamiliarity with the video game market and lack of 
knowledge on Roblox's game classification caused him to use imprecise terminology in his testimony. See Trial Tr. (Kosmynka) 
1015:18-1016:7, 1190:9-1191:6. Indeed, Mr. Schmid noted that while Roblox may have renamed the internal games offered 
within Roblox as ""experiences,"" it is ""not saying that Roblox has decided they are no longer a game."" Trial Tr. (Schmid) 3295:15-
17."
156,355," The Court leaves the thornier further questions of what is properly included and excluded in the definition of a video game to 
the academics and commentators. For instance, one example that arose beyond the issue of Roblox was the recent genre of 
films and shows on Netflix that allow users to make a choice akin to a ""choose your own adventure,"" including in Black Mirror: 
Bandersnatch, and Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt: Kimmy vs the Reverend. See Trial Tr. (Wright) 576:24-577:2. The Court need 
not determine whether this interactivity is sufficient to convert these forms of media into a video game. Suffice it to say, these 
examples as well as the ongoing efforts in the metaverse, appear to be an ongoing trend of converging entertainment mediums 
where the lines between each medium are beginning to mesh and overlap. "

Among those mentioned was Itchio.io. With respect to this app, Apple's counsel alluded to certain sexually explicit video games 
(i.e., ""Sisterly Lust"") offered by Itch.io. Given that the corresponding materials (e.g., storefront game pages) were not submitted 
to the Court, the Court cannot conclude one way or another whether this particular game, or other games offered on Itch.io, are 
as problematic as so alluded or suggested by Apple's counsel. Nonetheless, the Court finds that Apple's questioning and Mr. 
Allison's answers thereto illustrate some problems that may occur when permitting ""stores within stores"": namely, disparate 
guidelines and policies, and the difficulty of reviewing materials hosted by third parties. See Trial Tr. (Allison) 1257:5-1258:8,

Nintendo Gameboy, Nintendo DS, Sony PlayStation Vita). No evidence or explanation was provided on what occurred with 
these products or the handheld device market, though, the Court surmises that the rise of the mobile gaming market likely 
subsumed the handheld gaming market and perhaps led to Nintendo's decision to switch to mobility as a competitive edge for 
the Switch. Regardless, the Court notes the lack of evidence on this point, as well, as the Nintendo Switch generally, where 
evidence is limited to third-party testimony and certain Nintendo documents. Indeed, neither party called a Nintendo affiliated 
witness in this action to inquire on issues of competition in the general or console gaming market. Instead, the Court is left with a 
limited record on these matters."

162,398," Trial Tr. (Wright) 537:14-21 (emphasis supplied). Indeed, Ms. Wright only identified the Switch as a competitor after having 
been asked the substantively same question for a second time, wherein she identified the Switch as competition but qualified her 
answer by noting that the Switch competes ""much less"" than the PlayStation against the Xbox. Id. This appears to be in keeping 
with internal Microsoft documents reviewing its competitors, where numerous PlayStation games are identified over two-thirds of 
the page, in contrast to Switch games, which are limited primarily to just Nintendo published games and are relegated to the 
remaining third of the page along with games launched on PC. See PX-2476.006."

otherwise in the record. See Trial Tr. (Evans) 1736:3-20. The Court however finds Ms. Wright credible in her statements,

168,432, The Court relies on Apple's business records as admissions.
168,433," Compare four internal forecasting documents, namely, DX-4178.008 (2017 Review), PX-0602.027 (2018 Review), PX-
0608.014 (2019 Review), and PX-2302.022 (forecasting 2021 and 2020)."
168,434," See PX-2302.022 (reporting 24% market share). The Court notes a discrepancy between two sets of presentations 
calculating market share from 2015 to 2020 in the wider video gaming industry. The Court notes that the figures found in the 
most recent Apple presentation, along with figures found in the 2019 review (PX-0608), appear to match and correspond with 
third-party data found elsewhere in the record. See DX-3248. For that reason, the Court concludes that these figures in the most 
recent presentation are the more correct and updated versions. The market share rates found in the other (generally older) 
presentations appear to use estimates instead of the actual total revenue in the video game industry for certain years resulting in 
a lower total annual amount, which appears to inflate Apple's market share in these other presentations. Compare DX-4178.007 
(2017 presentation, stating 109 billion in total game revenue in the entire industry in 2017) with DX-3248.008 (2018 market 
report, stating 121.7 billion in total game revenue in the entire industry in 2017)."
168,435," Compare DX-4178.007 with DX-3248.008. The comparison shows a discrepancy in the portion of the mobile gaming market 
for the year 2017: namely Apple reports it as 42% in its presentation and third-party Newzoo reports it as 46% in its 2018 Global 
Games Market Report. The delta between these two figures is a few percentage points: using the third-party Newzoo figure in 
the Court's methodology, Apple's global market share is computed at 52.1% for 2017."
168,436," Relying on the same documents, for 2015, the Court takes Apple's 18% market share divided by 34% of the mobile share of 
the global market. For 2016, the Court takes Apple's 21.8% market share divided by 40% of the mobile share of the global 
market."
168,437," The Court notes that the 2020 Newzoo report is not in evidence, however, it is found as a ""Reference"" citation at the bottom 
of Apple's presentation. See PX-2302.022. These third-party references are often noted in presentations but only a few source 
documents are in evidence. The Court relies upon the reference because Newzoo is a credible third-party report that others in 
the industry rely upon. "
169,438," The same level of precision does not exist for 2018 and 2019 given the trial record. While the Court has evidence of Apple's 
market share in the wider gaming market and for certain years for the mobile gaming market, there is no discrete information or 
evidence for which it could calculate or find Apple's market share within mobile gaming for the years 2018 and 2019."
169,439," For instance, the Court lacks any revenue specific information regarding the Switch with which to include in any market share 
determination. As to game streaming services, given the only recent introduction of such products to market, the Court would 
expect any inclusion of such services to have a minimal impact, if any, on the overall market share calculations in this section."
169,440," See Trial Tr. (Bornstein) 4091:4-4092:3. Given the Court did not adopt the parties' market definitions, Epic Games' counsel 
would not commit to whether tablets would be included in that hypothetical market. Assuming a mobile and handheld device 
market as the relevant market, there are numerous tablet platforms and at least one mobile gaming console platform (Nintendo 
Switch) that would have to be included in such a market."
169,441," The Court also assumes for purposes of this analysis that the video game revenue cited in the corresponding Newzoo report 
is all attributable to digital game transactions. The Court notes that this overinclusion of non-digital game transactions and of the 
PlayStation and Xbox would depress Apple's market share if the Court were to only include digital game transactions attributed 
to the Switch. Nonetheless, the purpose of this analysis is to demonstrate that Apple retains market power above 30% even with 
the overinclusion of these additional platforms and non-digital transactions."
169,442," The Court notes that the Switch was released in March 2017, and thus, the inclusion would only affect the years 2017 and 
later. The Court discloses that Apple's market share for 2015 would be 27%."

rather than decreases its profits. Second, it claims that the 30% commission is consistent with other online platforms. Apple FOF 
¶¶ 469-478. This argument is discussed above and below in relation to anticompetitive conduct. In short, the use of a 30% 
commission by other platforms is not dispositive because those platforms have a different business model than Apple and 
frequently negotiate their headline rates, so their effective rates are below 30%."

iOS before IAP. Either way, Apple does not claim that freemium requires IAP at present time (as opposed to some other in-app 
payment processor), so this does not present a current procompetitive benefit. Second, Dr. Schmalensee opines that IAP is 
""essentially free"" to developers, who would need to build their own systems or obtain third-party services for payment processing 
otherwise. Id. ¶ 152. In light of Apple's 30% commission, the Court is not persuaded that developers could not obtain these 
features more cheaply from other companies. Last, Apple claims that IAP helps prevent fraud and ensure privacy. This feature is 
addressed in the next section as a procompetitive justification."

affected by Apple's conduct are subscription services. DX-4178.006; DX-4526.021. There are good reasons not to include those 
apps in the current litigation. First, Epic Games did not sell subscription services when Fortnite was on the iOS platform; their 
representation in the case is limited to third parties. Only one of those third parties testified at trial, so the Court lacks a full 
picture of the true opinions of these companies. Games and subscription apps in general are distinct, with little overlap among 
the popular examples. Compare PX-0608.015 with id. at .016. Second, many subscription services are subject to special rules, such as the ""reader rule"" that permits users to access app 
content purchased outside iOS on their Apple devices. Indeed, several large subscription providers (e.g., Spotify and Netflix) 
have stopped offering subscriptions through the App Store. Although games are subject to a similar ""multiplatform rule,"" the rule 
has only been in place since 2018 and the record is mixed whether game developers may be more or less able to similarly steer 
consumers to web transactions. Ex. Expert 6 (Hitt) ¶¶ 101-105; Trial Tr. (Schiller) 2808:6-2809:3; Trial Tr. (Sweeney) 110:12-

194,," Third, and finally, subscription providers may present different security challenges than game stores. Mr. Kosmynka testified that 
games are different than passive content because they add to or require the functionality of the smartphone. Mr. Schiller 
confirmed that Apple allows ""stores within a store"" that contain purely passive content, such as books and music. Thus, Apple's 
procompetitive justifications may be significantly different for game and non-game stores and apps. Trial Tr. (Kosmynka) 1073:7-
1074:18; Trial Tr. (Schiller) 3115:11-3117:7; Trial Tr. (Federighi) 3429:12-3430:8. Accordingly, the Court declines to consider subscriptions in this lawsuit because they are a separate submarket for which there 
is insufficient evidence."

limited record also shows that the Google Play app store similarly is constructed upon the same game transactions as the App

and emerging dynamic competition. Ex. Expert 8 (Schmalensee) ¶ 104. The Court addresses this evidence below."
194,574," That said, the evidence for a single distinct ""gamer"" demographic is inconclusive. For instance, Michael Schmid, testified that 
""gamers"" as he defined them are a ""very large percentage of users"" including ""all the people you speak with,"" suggesting a 
generally diverse gaming consumer base. Trial Tr. (Schmid) 3350:5-3352:3; see also id. 3351:15-17 (""The Court: Well, are you 
saying that all app users are also gamers? The Witness: Certainly not.""). But even without distinct customer demographics, the 
fact that only certain set of iOS consumers (i.e., those users who play games on iOS), as well as the separate set of developers 
and industry recognition as a distinct submarket make extrapolation from games to the whole market inappropriate. "

197,581," The Court notes that this identified problematic business model in Eastman Kodak, of selling the initial equipment near

opposed to Apple's business model for its iOS platform (profit on both the hardware and transactions). See supra Facts §§

198,583," Epic Games did not define the foremarket as the market for sale of mobile cellular phones or mobile devices. That said, even 
Dr. Evans acknowledges, consumers do not buy smartphone operating systems separately from smartphones. Trial Tr. (Evans) 
1621:19-23; Ex. Expert 7 (Lafontaine) ¶¶ 61-63. There is no price charged to consumers for either the iOS or the Android 
operating systems. See supra Facts § II.A.; Trial Tr. (Lafontaine) 2022:11-2023:4; Ex. Expert 1 (Evans) ¶ 139. "
199,584," Moreover, this 2007 statement is better categorized as a statement concerning price—not about any restriction on iOS app 
distribution or payment processing that Epic Games mainly challenges. In other words, this statement taken in the best possible 
light for Epic Games is a misrepresentation as to price—not as to any of the then and still present restrictions on distribution or 
payment processing."
199,585," Indeed, Epic Games' citation to Apple's 2009 action requiring IAP to process payment for in-app digital content does not 
persuade where no Epic Games expert witness opines that Apple had monopoly power prior to 2010 or 2011. Even considering 
this action, along with Apple's 2011 and 2016 rules regarding antisteering, subscriptions, and search ads, do not demonstrate 
any increase in the rate for consumers or developers. Indeed, most of these actions enabled increased functionality for 
consumers and developers, permitting new business models, and relied on increasing innovation on both the iOS device and the 
App Store."
199,586, Trial Tr. (Evans) 1508:15-1509:25. 
200,587," On some metrics, Apple is in fact more open than some competitors in the wider digital gaming market. For instance, the 
record reflects that certain competitors institute restrictions on cross-platform play and cross-platform wallet. Moreover, some 
platform owners require revenue sharing when game players disproportionately spend on a platform other than their own. 
Further still, some agreements require that certain goods be charged the same as the cheapest available on other platforms."
200,588," The Court has further never been satisfied by Epic Games' explanation as how its aftermarket theory as to Apple would not 
also apply to other platform holders with similar walled garden models in the wider gaming market, including Nintendo, Microsoft, 
and Sony. See Epic Games, Inc. v. Apple Inc., 493 F. Supp. 3d 817, 838-39 (N.D. Cal. 2020). The same three Newcal factors 
that readily apply to Apple's iOS devices would also facially apply to Nintendo's, Microsoft's, and Sony's consoles and their 
digital stores. Epic Games' distinction as to general purpose devices (e.g., iOS devices) versus special purpose devices (e.g., 
game consoles) has no basis in current antitrust law. Presumably, the factors would be applied in the same fashion. Instead, and as discussed above, consumers if anything appear to purchase a game console in the same manner they purchase 
an iOS device: understanding that they must purchase into an ecosystem and are limited in the later transactions for apps and 
games. Despite the foregoing, Epic Games does not claim that every game console manufacturer has unlawfully created and 
maintained a monopoly, and in fact, appears content to offer Fortnite and other Epic Games on those platforms without 
complaint. Trial Tr. (Schmalensee) 1904:15-1905:4. "

Washington had required distributors to sell alcohol at a uniform price and to post those prices publicly, among other restrictions. 
Id. To evaluate the conduct, the Ninth Circuit distinguished ""unilateral"" restraints—which were not prohibited by the Sherman

price restrictions were unilateral state conduct, but that the requirement to post and adhere to the prices was ""hybrid"" because 
private parties still retained discretion. Id. at 894, 899. It then found that the posting requirement violates Section 1. Id. at 895.

more robust rewards program,"" which created loyalty and ""encourage[d] the level of spending that makes Amex valuable to

209,604," For this reason, the spectacular growth of free apps on the App Store is not dispositive. While Apple may have decided, over

costs or value of providing free games, as the merchant fees in Amex were calibrated to providing rewards."
209,605," The record is bare as to who would ultimately benefit from a reduction in commissions. With the limited examples in the 
record, some developers, like Down Dog, pass on the entirety of the reduction in the commission to consumers, whereas Epic 
Games split the 30% commission by retaining 12% and remitting 18% to consumers. Thus, it is unclear the extent or degree to 
which developers would pass on any savings to consumers."
209,606," Under Amex, services for each of the two sides of the platform are both ""inputs"" to the single product, which is transactions. 
138 S. Ct. at 2286 n.8. Although Apple does not directly restrict game transaction output, it limits the supply of these inputs on

Regardless, the Court notes this distinction as a potential difference between the two analyses especially where, as recognized, 
proving a violation of Section 2 is more exacting than proving a violation of Section 1. To the extent appellate courts perceive a 
practical distinction, clarity is welcomed. "

""disadvantage"" app distribution outside of the App store). Although this request purports not to ""prohibit Apple from taking steps 
to prevent the distribution of malware,"" it is not clear what constitutes ""malware"" and whether that distinction includes ""broad""

213,617," In such a hypothetical world, developers could potentially avoid the commission while benefitting from Apple's innovation and 
intellectual property free of charge. The Court presumes that in such circumstances that Apple may rely on imposing and 
utilizing a contractual right to audit developers annual accounting to ensure compliance with its commissions, among other 
methods. Of course, any alternatives to IAP (including the foregoing) would seemingly impose both increased monetary and time 
costs to both Apple and the developers."

(bundling in the premium cable industry found to be ""simply more efficient than offering them separately""). As described above, 
the wider gaming industry routinely use walled gardens, including the PlayStation Store, the Nintendo eShop, and the Xbox 
Games Store. These game stores are vertically integrated with respect to distribution, content delivery, and payment 
functionalities. See supra Facts § II.D.3.c. The only exception is Epic Games Store. However, as noted, plaintiff's move occurred

217,620," In fact, as noted, IAP does not itself even process payments—that function is performed by a third-party settlement provider 
like Chase Bank with which Apple contracts. And unlike the purported alternatives that Epic Games proposes (e.g., PayPal), 
Apple has never tried to market the technology for use on other digital transaction platforms, and Epic Games does not contend 
otherwise."
217,621," The Court also notes that in the but-for world where developers could use an alternative processor, Apple would still be 
contractually entitled to its commission on any purchase made within apps distributed on the App Store. Thus, so long as the 
alternative processor charged a non-zero commission or fee for its services, no economically rational developer would choose to 
use the alternative processor, because on each transaction, they would still have to pay Apple its commission, and they would 
have to pay the alternative processor a commission for its services. For the same reason, the fact that some developers like 
Facebook and Spotify have tried to avoid Apple's commission by bypassing IAP is not evidence that there is separate demand 
for IAP, only that developers would prefer not to pay Apple a commission. Epic Games' reliance on this evidence thus ""conflates 
competition on the merits with Epic Games' goal of avoiding Apple's 30%."" Epic Games, Inc., 493 F. Supp. 3d at 843. "

218,624," Apple argues that Epic Games' Cartwright Act claims fail for lack of concerted action because the claims challenge ""only 
unilateral conduct,"" and the Cartwright Act ""does not impose liability for 'wrongful conduct on the part of a single entity.'"" Apple 
COL ¶¶ 588-589. The Court disagrees with this interpretation of Epic Games' claims. While Counts 7 and 8, as Counts 3 and 5, 
are predicated on the theory that the DPLA is an agreement between Apple and Epic Games, it may include particular terms that 
would constitute unreasonable restraints of trade. See Kolling v. Dow Jones & Co., 137 Cal. App. 3d 709, 719, 187 Cal. Rptr. 
797 (1982) (""If a 'single trader' pressures customers or dealers into adhering to"" restraints of trade, then ""an unlawful 
combination [under the Cartwright Act] is established, irrespective of any monopoly or conspiracy, and despite the recognized 
right of a producer to determine with whom it will deal"" (citations omitted)). "
219,625," Not only did Dr. Evans confirm in his live testimony that he would not describe iOS or Android as utilities, Trial Tr. (Evans)

1673:4-11, 2390:16-2391:2; see also generally Ex. Expert 1 (Evans) § II."
219,626," As a corollary, given that the nature of the ""facility"" is one solely comprised of intellectual property, as opposed to a physical 
structure, the question arises whether this claim could ever be recognized under Section 2 as a matter of law. Citing primarily 
district court cases, Apple argues it cannot be forced to license its intellectual property and to hold otherwise would chill 
innovation and investment. While the argument appears meritorious, the Court declines to rule on this issue as it was not fully 
vetted and is not necessary to the resolution of this claim. "

complaint [was] that Yelp's conduct unfairly injures their economic interests [relative] to the benefit of other businesses who 
choose to advertise with Yelp."" 765 F.3d 1123, 1136 (9th Cir. 2014). Here, Epic Games is not claiming that it is injured relative to 
other developers—developers are all subject to the same restrictions. This action, unlike Levitt, includes a view that Epic Games 
is a consumer of Apple's two-sided platform."

referenced. According to news reports, in order for Best Buy to compete with the likes of Amazon, and not just be a place where 
consumers physically test product but buy them more cheaply elsewhere, the company pivoted. It appears Best Buy actually 
rents square footage to companies like Apple and Samsung for ""branded space"" where they sell their own products and provide 
Best Buy not only with a revenue stream but the foot traffic to compete on other products. Compare Trial Tr. (Cook) 3864:24-

However, at the motion to dismiss stage, all allegations are taken as true and construed in Plaintiffs' favor. To be sure, Plaintiffs

reporting on Defendants' actions. Defendants question the reliability of these materials and the accuracy of Plaintiffs' 
methodology when crunching the data. However, at the motion to dismiss stage, ""the Court need not now engage in a Daubert-

285,9," Regarding pre-2015 behavior, Plaintiffs paint a very different picture. In the fourth quarter of 2012, Cargill and JBS both 
increased their slaughter volumes (3.7% and 12%) while Tyson held steady (0.1% increase) and National Beef cut back (-4%). 
(TAC ¶ 130.) Then, in the third quarter of 2013, Tyson and National Beef increased their slaughter volumes, while JBS and 
Cargill reduced theirs. (Id.) Further, across the second and fourth quarters of 2014, JBS looked to capture market share from the

289,19," Defendants also aver that many claims are time-barred, as the continuing violation doctrine is not recognized in eleven 
jurisdictions. Yet, Defendants fail to offer any analysis of the relevant case law from these states. Plaintiffs, on the other hand, 
discuss state case law, but often their citations involve unrelated causes of action. As such, neither party's briefing allows the 
Court to make an educated Erie guess on a per state basis regarding whether Plaintiffs' claims would likely be tolled in these 
jurisdictions. The Court will therefore defer consideration of this question, which will also allow a fuller factual and legal record to 
be developed. Regarding the remaining jurisdictions, however, the Court has already found that Plaintiffs have adequately 
pleaded a continuing violation by Defendants to toll any applicable statute of limitation."
289,20," As such, the Court declines to decipher the state of antitrust standing in each jurisdiction referenced by Defendants, as the 
same result would obtain even if state law dictated that AGC governs in a certain jurisdiction. "
290,21," While the Eighth Circuit has spoken in favor of precluding attempts to get around Illinois Brick by alleging the equitable remedy 
of disgorgement, it has not addressed whether plaintiffs can pursue damages under state consumer protection laws. See In re 
Pre-Filled Propane Tank Antitrust Litig., 893 F.3d 1047, 1059 (8th Cir. 2018)."
290,22," Defendants do ask the Court to reconsider its holding in a similar case that allegations pleading violations of state consumer 
protection laws based on anticompetitive conduct, not fraud, are not subject to Rule 9(b). See In re Pork Antitrust Litig., 495 F. 
Supp. 3d at 779-90. The Court remains unpersuaded by Defendants' argument and, as a result, will deny Defendants' Joint 
Motions to Dismiss with respect to Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs' state consumer protection claims, including their Montana and 
South Carolina claims. "
291,23," Defendants ask the Court to reconsider its earlier holding that certain state prohibitions against class actions are procedural, 
not substantive. In re Pork Antitrust Litig., 495 F. Supp. 3d at 776-78, 790. The Court comes to the same conclusion here and, 
accordingly, will deny Defendants' Joint Motions to Dismiss in regard to Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs' Montana, South Carolina, 
and Utah consumer protection claims."
291,24," Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs concede that their South Dakota consumer protection claims and Erbert & Gerbert's New York 
consumer protection claim fail for a lack of alleging, respectively, that Defendants made false promises or misrepresentations to 
them or materially misled them. Erbert & Gerbert's also states that it will withdraw its Missouri and Rhode Island consumer 
protection claims. Accordingly, the Court will grant Defendants' Joint Motions to Dismiss with respect to these five claims. 
Additionally, Defendants withdrew their arguments with respect to Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs' New Mexico consumer protection 
claims and Peterson Plaintiffs' Hawaii consumer protection claim. The Court will therefore deny Defendants' Joint Motions as to 
these claims."
291,25," The Court notes that the sole remedy under MUDTPA is injunctive relief. See Hudock v. LG Elecs. U.S.A., Inc., 16-1220, 2017 
WL 1157098, at *7 (D. Minn. Mar. 27, 2017). "
293,26," The Court notes that Defendants are free to bring a motion for summary judgment to ask the Court to consider whether any 
surviving claims fail to meet the elements required by certain jurisdictions then."
293,27," The Court notes that the parties presented a few additional cases to consider. After careful review, they did not alter the 
Court's thinking."
293,28," One argument, that Illinois Brick bars certain claims, has already been decided based on the Court's conclusions above: 
because Illinois Brick does not bar Plaintiffs' Missouri, Montana, or South Carolina consumer protection claims, neither does it 
bar Plaintiffs' Missouri, Montana, or South Carolina unjust enrichment claims. Thus, the Court will deny Defendants' Joint 
Motions to Dismiss in this regard. "
294,29," Each party does cite to a lower court decision. The one presented by Defendants cites to New York law for the proposition that 
a benefit must be direct. Alessi v. Bowen Court Condominium, No. 03-0235, 2010 WL 897246, at *4 (R.I. Super. Mar. 10, 2010). 
The one presented by Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs cites to another lower court decision that then cites to the Restatement of 
Restitution for the proposition that ""benefit"" denotes any form of advantage conferred to a defendant. State v. Purdue Pharma 
L.P., No. PC-2018-4555, 2019 WL 3991963, at *17 (R.I. Super. Aug. 16, 2019) (citing State v. Lead Ind. Assn., Inc., No. 99-
5226, 2001 WL 345830, at *15 (R.I. Super. Apr. 2, 2001). Given that neither holding is grounded in Rhode Island law, the Court 
finds that both are equally unpersuasive. "
295,30," The Court notes, without deciding, that Plaintiffs' single-enterprise theory could provide another plausible ground. See Arandell 
Corp. v. Centerpoint Energy Servs., Inc., 900 F.3d 623, 631 (9th Cir. 2018) (""[I]n a single-enterprise situation, it is the affiliated 
corporations' collective conduct—i.e., the conduct of the enterprise they jointly compose—that matters; it is the enterprise which 
must be shown to satisfy the elements of a [Sherman Act] claim."" (cleaned up)); see also Copperweld, 467 U.S. at 771 (""[I]n 
reality a parent and a wholly owned subsidiary always have a unity of purpose or a common design."")."
295,31," Regarding the misnaming of a JBS Defendant by Direct and Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs, the Court will allow amendment back 
for Plaintiffs to rename JBS USA Food Company Holdings as JBS USA Food Company. See Roberts v. Michaels, 219 F.3d 775, 
777-78 (8th Cir. 2000). "
296,32," The Court notes that because it will order service on attorneys who have already appeared on behalf of JBS S.A., no due 
process concerns are implicated. See, e.g., Washington State Inv. Bd. v. Odebrecht S.A., No. 17-8118, 2018 WL 6253877, at *5 
(S.D.N.Y. Sept. 21, 2018). "
300,1," To the extent defendants' motion comes under Rule 12(b)(6), the facts are taken from plaintiff's amended complaint, as well as 
any documents attached to it or incorporated by reference, and read in the light most favorable to it. To the extent defendants' 
motion comes under Rule 12(b)(2), however, some facts may be considered from beyond the four corners of the complaint. "
301,2," Pagination refers to the overall page number, not the page numbers the document gives itself. Because the amended 
complaint specifically refers to WCI's 2019 annual report, the Court may rely on it in resolving defendants' personal jurisdiction 
and failure to state a claim arguments. "
305,3," Unless plaintiff can establish that defendants' contracts are ""so plainly anti-competitive and so lacking in redeeming pro-
competitive value that [they are] presumed illegal without further examination,"" plaintiff will have to clear the rule of reason test. 
Geneva Pharm. Tech. Corp. v. Barr Labs. Inc., 386 F.3d 485, 506 (2d Cir. 2004). Under that test, plaintiff would be required to 
establish an ""actual adverse effect on competition as a whole in the relevant market."" Id."
305,4," Because Count II survives as a whole, the Court need not delve into whether plaintiff's alternate theories of recovery under this 
count have merit at this juncture. "
306,5," To the extent that plaintiff relies on an ""intent"" theory also recognized by the Eleventh Circuit, the Second Circuit has never 
acknowledged that theory, either. Compare Morris, 364 F.3d at 1294 (Eleventh Circuit describing ""intent theory"" of 
monopolization), with In re Adderall, 754 F.3d at 134 (recognizing termination of prior course of dealing as ""sole exception"" to 
right to refuse to deal with competitor). "
309,6," If a plaintiff cannot meet § 22's venue requirements, the plaintiff must establish personal jurisdiction through state law. See 
Daniel, 428 F.3d at 427 (noting that plaintiff failing to meet venue requirements of § 22 ""must look to other service of process 
provisions, notably those specified in [Rule] 4 or incorporated therein from state law to satisfy this requirement""). "

suggestion of waiver."" See Dkt. No. 142 51 n.2. Because they are unchanged, that filing did not moot the motion and no party 
has suggested otherwise. "

322,5, Columbia Pictures passingly cited one district court case that cuts against my holding here; that issue is addressed below. 
324,6," Wisk's other case from this Circuit concerned a letter sent to customers of the other party announcing the litigation and putting 
them on notice that they may be sued for purchasing infringing products, which is a far cry from the situation here. See AirHawk 
Int'l, LLC v. TheRealCraigJ, LLC, No. SACV1600624JVSKESX, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 147499, 2017 WL 3891214, at *3 (C.D.

330,2, The facts in this section are reiterated from the Court's prior Report and Recommendation. (Dkt. No. 40). 
331,3," ""LED"" stands for light-emitting diode, a type of light source. "
332,4," Plaintiff's federal unfair competition and trademark infringement claims are brought under the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. §1051 et 
seq. "
333,5," Fraud and functionality are interrelated issues here because the statement on which Grote bases one of its allegations of fraud 
is linked to the TTAB's decision that the product configuration is non-functional. More specifically, Grote alleges that Robert E. 
Ives, Vice President for Marketing at Truck-Lite, submitted to the USPTO a sworn declaration which fraudulently stated: ""[t]he 
trade dress of the subject application is not the subject of either a pending design or utility patent application or of any issued or 
expired design or utility patents."" (Dkt. No. 48, ¶¶ 21-31). Grote contends that Mr. Ives knew of the existence of a utility patent 
issued to Truck-Lite (U.S. Patent 6,654,172, ""the '172 patent"") which disclosed the functional nature of the penta-star mark, or 5-
around-1 LED configuration, in stop/tail/turn lamps, but he made a false declaration to prevent rejection by the examiner on the 
grounds that the trade dress did not function as a mark. (Id.) Truck-Lite argued before the TTAB that the penta-star design is 
ornamental and nonfunctional and was only incidentally disclosed in the '172 patent. The TTAB agreed, concluding that although 
the '172 patent stated that the penta-star pattern was the ""preferred embodiment of the invention,"" other light configurations 
could be used, and the pattern was not essential to the use or purpose of the article. (Dkt. No. 1-3, pg. 20). By extension, Truck-
Light submits that the TTAB already determined the veracity of the representation that no utility patent disclosed functionality of 
the subject pattern. "
334,6," To this point, in an appeal to the Federal Circuit, a case proceeds on a closed administrative record and no new evidence is 
permitted. CAE, Inc. v. Clean Air Engineering, Inc., 267 F.3d 660, 673 (7th Cir. 2001). In contrast, an appeal to the district court 
is both an appeal and a new action, which allows the parties to request additional relief and to submit new evidence. Id. "
335,7," Issue preclusion is the well-recognized doctrine that ""the determination of a question directly involved in one action is 
conclusive as to that question in a second suit."" B&B Hardware, 575 U.S. at 147 (quoting Cromwell v. County of Sec, 94 U.S. 
351, 354 (1877)). The ordinary elements necessary for issue preclusion to apply are as follows: (1) the issues in both 
proceedings must be identical, (2) the issue in the prior proceeding must have been actually litigated and actually decided, (3) 
there must have been a full and fair opportunity for litigation in the prior proceedings, and (4) the issue previously litigated must 
have been necessary to support a valid and final judgment on the merits. See, e.g., Gelb v. Royal Globe Ins. Co., 798 F.2d 38, 
44 (2d Cir. 1986)."
335,8," It is also noted that because the TTAB did not reach the fraud arguments, no findings related to fraud were essential to the 
judgment. Thus, it would be untenable for Truck-Lite to argue that Grote is estopped from litigating the fraud allegations which 
are unrelated to functionality of the design. "
337,9," Grote's Answer and Counterclaim against Truck-Lite was timely under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(a)(4)(A), having been filed within 14 
days after Judge Sinatra's Decision and Order denying Grote's motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. (Dkt. Nos. 46; 
48)."
337,10," American Cyanamid v. Campagna Per La Farmacie in Italia S.P.A., 678 F. Supp. 1049 (S.D.N.Y. 1987) is inapposite as it 
addressed questions of primary jurisdiction, not timeliness. That Court concluded that a trademark infringement action did not 
need to be stayed pending a USPTO determination of the registrability of the allegedly infringing marks. Such a holding does not 
dictate that a USPTO proceeding cannot toll the statute of limitations for a later Lanham Act claim."
337,11," See MPC Franchise, LLC v. Tarntino, 826 F.3d 653, 659 (2d Cir. 2016) for clarification of this element. The distinction is not of 
issue here. "
338,12," In the non-precedential TTAB opinion cited by Truck-Lite on this point, the facts are distinguishable and, although the court 
saw no reliance by the examiner on respondent's claims about exclusive right to use a certain term, the finding of no fraud in "
339,," prosecution of the application was based on lack of evidence of respondent's intent to deceive the Trademark Office. See Eddy 
Packing Co., Inc. v. HEB Grocery Co., 2010 TTAB LEXIS 108, at *52-55 (TTAB Apr. 15, 2010) (unpublished opinion). "
340,13," Grote also maintains that the cases relied on above are distinguishable in their application progression. Grote identifies that in 
GMA Accessories and Bernard, the subject applications were ""suspended"" but not ""allowed"" for publication. The Court does not 
find the factual differences of those cases and the case at bar to be meaningful, as none of the applications proceeded to 
registration. "
341,14," Although the Court recommends dismissal of Grote's Section 38 claim for damages arising from the '319 Application, it does 
not believe that precludes Grote from relying on the alleged fraudulent statements to support its antitrust claims."
341,15," The Court acknowledges but does not find persuasive Truck-Lite's reliance on Virgin Enters. v. Virginic LLC, wherein the 
district court characterized the ""antitrust defense"" to trademark infringement as ""more theoretical than actual."" See 19-CV-0220-
F, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 63580, at *8-9 (D. Wyo. Apr. 10, 2020). There, the court granted a motion to strike the affirmative "
342,," defense because defendant did not provide a basis for its antitrust claims, apart from plaintiff's civil litigation and trademark 
proceedings. Id., at *10-11. Based on defendant's failure to dispute its own infringing conduct, the Court found that plaintiff's 
actions were not objectively baseless under a sham exception. Id., at *13-14. By comparison, Grote has not conceded 
infringement on its own part and it has alleged objectively baseless litigation. The Court also finds In re Humira (Adalimumab) 
Antitrust Litigation inapplicable. See 19-CV-1873, 465 F. Supp. 3d 811 (N.D. Ill. Jun 8, 2020). Humira held that a party cannot 
aggregate immunized and non-immunized conduct without nullifying the immunity. Id., at 834. In this case, the Court does not 
view any of the alleged anticompetitive conduct as immune. "
347,1," This Court takes the following facts from Defendants' Rule 56.1 Statement of Material Facts, Plaintiffs' Statement of Material 
Facts, and Defendants' Response to Plaintiff's Statement of Material Facts [102], [108], [119]."
347,2," Scientific Games formerly operated a technology campus in Chicago, Illinois. [102] at ¶ 12."
347,3," Plaintiffs characterize this letter as a settlement letter, Defendants characterize it as a Rule 11 letter. "
351,4," Defendants also repeat their arguments that TF knew about the potential antitrust claims when it released its claims. But, as 
explained above, issues of material fact remain as to whether Plaintiffs were aware of these claims. "
355,1," The Court noted in ruling on the Defendant's Partial Summary Judgment Motion as to Counts I, III, IV, VI, VII, and VIII that the 
Court would revisit the sufficiency of the evidence pursuant to F.R.C.P. 50. "
357,2," While Tunis and several other cases relied on by the Court involved alleged violations of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, the 
Court finds the cited analysis instructive here. The Third Circuit has made it clear that, while ""'inquiries into the scope of "
358,," competition under § 1 and § 2 are not precisely the same,'"" where the Plaintiffs have failed to ""present a sufficiently close factual 
issue,"" it is not necessary for the Court to confine itself to case law only dealing with claims brought under the same section. 
Tunis Bros. Co., 952 F.2d at 724 n.3 (citing Columbia Metal Culvert Co., 579 F.2d at 27 n.11). "
359,3," In their Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs also allege that that QVC's conduct was fraudulent under the UCL. ECF No. 7 ¶ 156. 
However, Plaintiffs do not address this claim in their Response to the Motion (ECF No. 84), and it is clear that corporate 
competitors cannot bring claims under the fraudulent prong of the UCL. See 77 F. Supp. 3d at 866. "
362,1, The Background is a summary of the allegations in the Complaint. 
365,2," The ""Class"" is: ""All persons or entities residing in the United States that owned websites that were active between March 2018 
and April 2020 (the 'Class Period') on which Google's logo and Related Pages banner ads appeared when their websites were 
viewed by Android mobile phone owners using the Search App."" Compl. ¶ 156. The ""Georgia Subclass"" is: ""All persons or entities residing in Georgia that owned websites that were active between March 
2018 and April 2020 on which Google's logo and Related Pages banner ads appeared when their websites were viewed by 
Android mobile phone owners using the Search App."" Id. ¶ 157. The ""California Subclass"" is: ""All persons or entities residing in California that owned websites that were active between March 
2018 and April 2020 on which Google's logo and Related Pages banner ads appeared when their websites were viewed by 
Android mobile phone owners using the Search App."" Id. ¶ 158."
365,3," None of Plaintiffs' websites, files, or data were physically altered in any way. Nor were Plaintiffs' servers disrupted."
365,4," A property right exists in a domain name because (1) it is an interest capable of precise definition; (2) it is capable of exclusive 
possession or control; and (3) registrants of the domain name have a legitimate claim to exclusivity. Id. at 1030. "
366,5," The Kremen court observed that ""courts routinely apply the tort to intangibles without inquiring whether they are merged in a 
document and, while it's often possible to dream up some document the intangible is connected to in some fashion, it's seldom 
one that represents the owner's property interest."" Kremen, 337 F.3d at 1033."
366,6," After Kremen, the California Court of Appeal, Sixth Appellate District, noted that conversion traditionally required a taking of 
tangible property and that ""this restriction has been greatly eroded,"" but not ""destroyed."" Silvaco Data Sys. v. Intel Corp., 184 "
367,," Cal. App. 4th 210, 239 n.21, 109 Cal. Rptr. 3d 27 (2010) (emphasis in original). The Silvaco court also cautioned that ""the 
expansion of conversion law to reach intangible property should not be permitted to 'displace other, more suitable law.'"" Id. As 
discussed above, however, Plaintiffs' websites have a connection to a tangible object."
367,7," In Gary Friedrich Enters., LLC v. Marvel Enters., 713 F. Supp. 2d 215 (S.D.N.Y. 2010), the court held that the claim for 
trespass to chattels under Illinois and New York law failed because (1) defendant never assumed ""physical control"" over 
plaintiff's story idea and characters and (2) the claim was preempted by federal copyright law. Other cases cited by Google do 
not discuss the distinction between tangible and intangible property and offer little guidance. See e.g., Level 3 Commc'ns, Inc. v. 
Lidco Imperial Valley, Inc., 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 146887, 2012 WL 4848929, at *4 (S.D. Cal. Oct. 11, 2012) (explaining that 
trespass to chattels requires ""intentionally bringing about a physical contact with the chattel""); In re L.T., 103 Cal. App. 4th 262, 
265, 126 Cal. Rptr. 2d 778 (2002) (explaining that for arson, ""chattels"" are things that are ""visible, tangible, movable""); Italiani v. 
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Corp., 45 Cal. App. 2d 464, 467, 114 P.2d 370 (1941) (explaining that trover, detinue and replevin require 
""interference with possession of, or damage to, some specific tangible property, and are not concerned with intangible or 
incorporeal rights which may exist in connection with, or entirely apart from any particular piece of physical property""); In re 
iPhone Application Litig., 844 F. Supp. 2d 1040, 1069 (N.D. Cal. 2012) (dismissing trespass claim because although placement 
of data on Iphones may have caused ""harm"" by taking up bandwidth, storage space, or shortening the battery life of a device, 
plaintiffs did not plausibly establish a significant reduction in service constituting an ""interference with the intended functioning of 
the system, as by significantly reducing its available memory and processing power"") (citation omitted); Angelica Textile Servs., 
Inc. v. Park, 220 Cal. App. 4th 495, 508, 163 Cal. Rptr. 3d 192 (2013) (conversion claim asserted against an employee who 
retained plaintiff's documents was not displaced by California's Uniform Trade Secrets Act). "
369,8," As such, this case is distinguishable from the cases cited by Google in which the plaintiff asserted claims of copyright 
infringement. See 1-800 Contacts, Inc. v. WhenU.com, 309 F. Supp. 2d 467, 479 (S.D.N.Y. 2003); Wells Fargo & Co. v. 
WhenU.com, Inc., 293 F. Supp. 2d 734, 738 (E.D. Mich. 2003); and U-Haul Int'l, Inc. v. WhenU.com, Inc., 279 F. Supp. 2d 723, 
724 (E.D. Va. 2003) (rejecting copyright infringement claim, but dismissing unjust enrichment claim without prejudice). "
370,9," As such, this suit is distinguishable from cases relied on by Google. See Identity Arts v. Best Buy Enter. Servs., Inc., 2007 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 32060, 2007 WL 1149155, at *20 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 18, 2007) (preemption applied to unjust enrichment claim that was 
based on wrongful creation and use of derivative works of a movie trailer); Design Data Corp. v. Unigate Enter., 2013 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 12060, 2013 WL360542, at *7 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 29, 2013) (preemption applied to implied contract claim that was based on 
unauthorized use of copyrighted structural steel detailing software); Santos v. Telmundo Commc'ns Grp. LLC, 2012 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 189524, 2012 WL 9503003, at *8 (C.D. Cal. Dec. 19, 2012) (unjust enrichment claim based on same facts and same 
rights as copyright claim, i.e. alleged broadcasting of songs without permission, was preempted)."
370,10," Copyrights extend to ""original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression,"" such as literary, musical, 
graphic, architectural works and sound recordings. 17 U.S.C. § 102(a). "
371,11," California's Consumer Legal Remedies Act defines a consumer as ""an individual who seeks or acquires, by purchase or lease, 
any goods or services for personal, family, or household purposes."" Cal. Civ. Code § 1761; see also Cal. Civ. Code § 1791 
(""consumer goods"" are products ""used, bought, or leased for use primarily for personal, family, or household purposes""). "
372,12," The other cases relied upon by Google are inapplicable here. See Stanley v. Georgia, 394 U.S. 557, 564, 89 S. Ct. 1243, 22 
L. Ed. 2d 542 (1969) (holding that First and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit making private possession of obscene material a 
crime); Citizens United v. FEC, 558 U.S. 310, 339, 130 S. Ct. 876, 175 L. Ed. 2d 753 (2010) (federal statute barring independent 
corporate expenditures for electioneering communications violated First Amendment). "
385,1," Not all of these issues are given equal attention in UHS's complaint. Some are mentioned in passing and never discussed 
again. As such, the Court's analysis will follow suit and focus on the issues to which UHS has given its attention."
385,2," University Hospital Conway was located in Monroe, Louisiana. "
386,3," E. R.R. Presidents Conf. v. Noerr Motor Freight, 365 U.S. 127, 81 S. Ct. 523, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464 (1961); United Mine Workers of 
Am. v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 85 S. Ct. 1585, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626 (1965). "
387,4," Many of the areas in which UHS claims LSU Health Shreveport refused to cooperate are insufficient for purposes of 
establishing antitrust injury. For example, the litany of ways in which the two entities could have shared costs, coordinated on a 
drug formulary, or established an outpatient imaging center, allegedly would have decreased costs or increased profitability. For 
these, there is no suggestion that they would have harmed, or in the converse, helped patients or the consumer market. The 
Court will not consider those allegations for purposes of assessing whether UHS has alleged an antitrust injury, as the antitrust 
laws protect competition, not the competitor. Brooke Grp. Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 509 U.S. 209, 225, 113 S. 
Ct. 2578, 125 L. Ed. 2d 168 (1993). The Court is concerned with harm to UHS only insofar as that harm resulted in a 
concomitant effect upon consumer costs, the quality of care, access to care, and patient choice. With that in mind, the Court 
deems sufficient the allegations regarding the narrow insurance network, co-management of certain departments, improvements 
upon physician productivity, recruitment of or privileges to new physicians, staffing of clinics, Dr. Nanda's termination, and 
improved clinical documentation. "
388,5," Although they are not at issue in this opinion, the Fifth Circuit has set forth the analysis for the other elements: Once a plaintiff establishes that a conspiracy occurred, whether it violates § 1 is determined by the application of either the 
per se rule or the rule of reason. The per se rule is appropriate only after courts have had considerable experience with the 
type of restraint at issue and only if courts can predict with confidence that it would be invalidated in all or almost all 
instances under the rule of reason. Moreover, the per se rule should only be applied when conduct is so pernicious and 
devoid of redeeming virtue that it is condemned without inquiry into the effect on the market in the particular case at hand. Under a rule of reason analysis, the factfinder considers all of the circumstances to determine whether a restrictive practice 
imposes an unreasonable restraint on competition. The court's considerations should include the restrictive practice's 
history, nature, and effect and whether the businesses involved have market power. Market power has been defined as the 
ability to raise prices above those that would be charged in a competitive market. The rule [**24]  of reason analysis also 
requires that the plaintiff show that the defendants' activities injured competition. HN8[
] The rule of reason is designed to 
help courts differentiate between restraints with anticompetitive effect that are harmful to the consumer and restraints 
stimulating competition that are in the consumer's best interest. Regardless of which rule applies, the court's inquiry should 
ultimately focus upon forming a judgment about the competitive significance of the restraint. Marucci Sports, 751 F.3d at 374 (cleaned up). "
390,6," While the Court has not tightly compartmentalized each set of allegations, analyzed them independently, and wiped the slate 
clean after each examination, it does note that the Fifth Circuit has expressed doubt as to whether instances of alleged conduct, 
which individually are not anticompetitive, can be aggregated to be considered cumulatively anticompetitive. Retractable Techs., 
Inc. v. Becton Dickinson & Co., 842 F.3d 883, 892 (5th Cir. 2016) (citing with approval City of Groton v. Conn. Light & Power, 
662 F.2d 921, 928 (2d Cir. 1981) (holding alleged instances of misconduct, none of which is anticompetitive, cannot be 
cumulatively anticompetitive.)). The Retractable Technologies opinion explained that there has been no case since its 1980 
decision in Associated Radio Service Co. v. Page Airways, Inc., 624 F.2d 1342, 1356 (5th Cir. 1980), in which ""a congeries of 
business torts was found so egregious as to constitute actionable predatory or exclusionary conduct."" Id. Nonetheless, in the 
instant case, the Court's antitrust analysis has been as coterminous as UHS's complaint and the law allow. "
391,7," The Court notes that in the 2015 case, it concluded that Willis-Knighton's control of physician referrals was not anticompetitive 
under Section 2 of the Sherman Act because it did not lack competition on the merits. BRFHH Shreveport, LLC v. Willis 
Knighton Med. Ctr., 176 F. Supp. 3d 606, 625-26 (W.D. La. 2016). That is, the practice had a rational business purpose 
(treatment of more patients) and Willis-Knighton could not have accomplished the acts without the consent and participation of 
consumers. Id. at 625. "
392,8," UHS has alleged both monopolization and attempted monopolization in violation of Section 2. These claims are 
indistinguishable for the purposes of evaluating Willis-Knighton's dismissal arguments. Because anticompetitive conduct is an 
element of both, Spectrum Sports, Inc. v. McQuillan, 506 U.S. 447, 456, 113 S. Ct. 884, 122 L. Ed. 2d 247 (1993), the viability of 
either claim is dependent upon UHS's ability to sufficiently plead anticompetitive conduct."
392,9," HN20[
] To establish Section 2 violations asserting monopolization, a plaintiff must define the relevant market. Doctor's Hosp., 123 F.3d at 311. The Court assumes for present purposes that the healthcare market in the Shreveport-Bossier City area 
is a relevant antitrust market. "
393,10," HN23[
] Courts also label anticompetitive conduct exclusionary conduct, predatory conduct, and improper conduct. See Taylor Pub. Co. v. Jostens, Inc., 216 F.3d 465, 475 n.2 (5th Cir. 2000) (""We use the terms 'predatory' and 'exclusionary' 
interchangeably . . . .""). "
394,11," HN26[
] As the Fifth Circuit instructed, the ""distinction between unfair conduct and anticompetitive conduct is critical to 
maintain because the antitrust laws 'do not create a federal law of unfair competition or purport to afford remedies for all torts 
committed by or against persons engaged in interstate commerce.' "" Retractable Techs., 842 F.3d at 892-93 (quoting Brooke 
Grp. Ltd., 509 U.S. at 225) (internal marks omitted). The Supreme Court has stressed that ""[e]ven an act of pure malice by one 
business competitor against another does not, without more, state a claim under the federal antitrust laws."" Brooke Grp., 509 
U.S. at 225. "

23(b)(2) action has proceeded as Barry's Cut Rate Stores Inc. v. Visa, Inc., No. 05-MD-1720. In addition, the action has 
sometimes been referred to as ""Barry's"" and the class referred to as the ""equitable relief class"" or the ""injunctive relief class."" 
Because the Rule 23(b)(2) Plaintiffs seek both declaratory and injunctive relief, and because Barry's Cut Rate Stores Inc. is no 
longer a party to this action, the Court uses the terms ""Rule 23(b)(2)"" and ""equitable relief"" to refer to the action, as opposed to 
""Barry's"" and ""injunctive relief"" action."

452,9," To assist with his determination, Judge Gleeson appointed an economic and legal expert, Dr. Alan O. Sykes of New York 
University School of Law, to aid the court in weighing the settlement agreement and accompanying expert reports because ""[t]he

MasterCard, even if those reforms are repealed or otherwise undone."" Interchange Fees I, 986 F. Supp. 2d at 217. The Durbin 
Amendment ""limited the interchange fee that issuing banks could charge for debit card purchases, and allowed merchants to 
discount debit card purchases relative to credit card purchases."" Interchange Fees II, 827 F.3d at 229. In the DOJ consent 
decree, ""after an investigation assisted by the information developed by the [P]laintiffs,"" and following lawsuits that the DOJ 
initiated against Visa, Mastercard, and American Express in 2010, Interchange Fees I, 986 F. Supp. 2d at 215, ""Visa and "

also Interchange Fees II, 827 F.3d at 229 (""[P]ursuant to a consent decree with the Department of Justice in 2011, Visa and

developments affected the honor-all-cards or no-surcharging rules, or the existence of a default interchange fee."")."
453,11," In particular, the Second Circuit found that unitary representation of the classes violated Rule 23(a)(4) — the class certification 
requirement that representative parties adequately protect the interests of the class — and the Due Process Clause, which 
requires that named plaintiffs in a class action adequately protect the interests of absent class members. Interchange Fees II, 
827 F.3d at 228, 231."
453,12," The Court notes that the landscape of state no-surcharging laws is changing. For example, in 2017, the Supreme Court held 
that a New York state statute that prohibited merchants from imposing a surcharge on customers using credit cards regulated 
speech, and the court remanded the matter to the Second Circuit to determine whether such speech regulation violates the First 
Amendment. See Expressions Hair Design v. Schneiderman, 581 U.S. ---, 137 S. Ct. 1144, 1146 (Mar. 29, 2017). In addressing 
a similar California statute, in 2018, the Ninth Circuit held that the statute violated First Amendment commercial free speech 
rights. Italian Colors Rest. v. Becerra, 878 F.3d 1165, 1179 (9th Cir. 2018). Also in 2018, a federal district court in Texas relied 
on Expressions Hair Design to hold that the state's anti-surcharge statute was unconstitutional as applied to the merchants in the 
case. See Rowell v. Paxton, 336 F. Supp. 3d 724, 732 (W.D. Tex. 2018). "

Professor Defendants have filed Daubert motions to challenge the expert opinions of Professor Dennis W. Carlton and Dr. Joseph E.

Expert Dennis W. Carlton, Docket Entry No. 8086; Defs.' Mot. to Exclude Pls.' Expert Joseph E. Stiglitz, Docket Entry No. 8075.) 
However, Defendants did not oppose Plaintiffs' motion for class certification, and the Court therefore infers that Defendants seek 
exclusion of Professor Carlton's and Dr. Stiglitz's opinions as to liability on summary judgment only and not for class certification 
purposes. Accordingly, the Court declines to assess whether the opinions of Professor Carlton and Dr. Stiglitz are admissible to 
establish the requirements of Rule 23 before deciding the class certification motions. See In re Foreign Exch. Benchmark Rates 
Antitrust Litig., 407 F. Supp. 3d at 429 (applying ""a Daubert analysis to the extent that [the] [d]efendant seeks to exclude 
testimony relevant to class certification"" (emphasis added)). "
463,21," The two cases cited by the Merchant Trade Groups to support excluding future merchants from the proposed class concern 
standing and numerosity, and do not defeat commonality. In In re Currency Conversion Fee Antitrust Litigation, a case 
concerning an alleged price-fixing conspiracy of foreign currency conversion fees, the court declined to include ""cardholders 
whose first foreign exchange transaction occurred after the addition of the arbitration clause to their cardholder agreement"" "
464,," because ""there was no cognizable injury when this action commenced."" 229 F.R.D. 57, 63 (S.D.N.Y. 2005), appeal granted, 
order amended, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16130, 2005 WL 1871012 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2005). In Scott v. University of Delaware, a 
class action discrimination suit, the Third Circuit held that the class should have been decertified because future faculty 
members could not satisfy the numerosity requirement. 601 F.2d 76, 89 (3d Cir. 1979), abrogated on other grounds by EF 
Operating Corp. v. Am. Bldgs., 993 F.2d 1046 (3d Cir. 1993). The Third Circuit held that the ""class of future faculty members is 
simply ephemeral on the facts of this case"" because it was ""constructed on the hypothesis that the [u]niversity will hire black[] 
[faculty members] . . . and then discriminate against them by refusing to renew employment contracts or by denying promotion or 
tenure solely on the basis of race."" Id. Unlike the class members in those cases, the putative class member merchants face 
""imminent threat of injury,"" In re Currency Conversion Fee Antitrust Litig., 229 F.R.D. at 63, arising from the Defendants' alleged 
anticompetitive conduct as long as they accept Visa and Mastercard credit and debit cards should they not be included in the 
injunctive relief class. "
466,22," To the extent that any party challenges typicality on the grounds that Plaintiffs, as mostly small, single-location retailers, differ 
in size and structure from other class members, (see Direct Action Pls.' Opp'n 20-21 (describing the factual differences between 
the class representatives and the class members); Merchant Trade Groups' Opp'n 5-6, 13-14 (same)), the Court notes that such 
an argument is not sufficient to defeat typicality, which focuses on the factual and legal arguments that would be made to prove 
liability. See Meredith Corp. v. SESAC, LLC, 87 F. Supp. 3d 650, 660 (S.D.N.Y. 2015) (finding typicality requirement satisfied 
although ""conceivably not all class members may be similarly situated as to damages,"" because ""as to liability, the claims of the 
named plaintiffs here are typical of those of the class"" and ""[t]o prevail, each would be required to show that [the defendant's] 
practices with respect to the blanket licenses violated § 1 or § 2 of the Sherman Act, and effectively forced class members to 
accept a . . . blanket license with an artificially high price""); Dial Corp. v. News Corp., 314 F.R.D. 108, 114 (S.D.N.Y. 2015) 
(rejecting the defendant's argument that the class representatives' claims are not typical of the rest of the class because the 
class representatives differed in when they purchased in-store promotion services and their geographic range of marketing),

Litig., 279 F.R.D. 90, 111 (E.D.N.Y. 2012) (""A putative class representative need not be a heavy-weight in its industry to satisfy 
the typicality prong; the relevant inquiry is simply whether absent class members' interests are advanced by the prosecution of 
the representative's claim.""). "
468,23," For the reasons stated in Section II.c.iv.1.E, the Court declines to reach the issue of whether future merchants are adequately 
represented in this class. "
469,24," The Court is not aware of any case discussing whether the adequacy of representation requirement under the Due Process 
Clause is coextensive with Rule 23(a)(4). See 1 Newberg on Class Actions § 3:51 (5th ed.) (""[N]o court has ever considered the 
specific question of whether the constitutional requirement of adequate representation for preclusion purposes is less exacting 
than Rule 23's requirement of adequate representation for certification purposes.""); William B. Rubenstein, Finality in Class 
Action Litigation: Lessons from Habeas, 82 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 790, 810 & n.79 (2007) (""[A]re all of the aspects of Rule 23 — 
including (a)(4) and (g) and all of their subparts, interpretations, and subsequent fairness hearing assessments — necessarily a 
part of the Constitution's demand for adequacy? Remarkably, the answer is that there is no answer. No court or commentator 
has ever scrutinized the question; all just assume an equivalence.""); Samuel Issacharoff, Governance and Legitimacy in the Law 
of Class Actions, 1999 Sup. Ct. Rev. 337, 373 (""There is no reason to believe . . . the concept of adequate representation 
present in the rules is anything other than the level of constitutional protection of absent class member interests necessary to 
deem their virtual participation in litigation fundamentally fair.""). Because the parties address adequacy of representation under 
Rule 23(a)(4) and under the Due Process Clause interchangeably and there is no authority to the contrary, and because Second 
Circuit jurisprudence does not appear to draw any distinction between adequacy under the Due Process Clause and Rule 23, 
see, e.g., Interchange Fees II, 827 F.3d at 236 (""Part of the due process inquiry (and part of the Rule 23(a) class certification 
requirements) involves assessing adequacy of representation and intra-class conflicts."" (quoting Stephenson v. Dow Chem. Co., 
273 F.3d 249, 260 (2d Cir. 2001), aff'd in part and vacated in part, 539 U.S. 111, 123 S. Ct. 2161, 156 L. Ed. 2d 106 (2003))), 
the Court assumes the two requirements are equivalent and addresses them together. "
471,25," Visa's all-outlets practice requires that ""an entity that accepts Visa at one location to accept the cards at all locations in order 
to qualify for a better interchange tier."" (Grubhub Pls.' Opp'n 5.) "
472,26," The honor-all-wallets rules are an application of the honor-all-cards rules to payments made via mobile devices. (See Pls.' 
Suppl. Reply 4 (""[T]he 'honor-all-wallets' rule . . . is an application of the [honor-all-cards] rule to mobile devices.""); Compl. ¶ 295 
(""Visa and MasterCard have also construed and applied their [h]onor [a]ll [c]ards rules to become '[h]onor [a]ll [d]evices' rules. 
Specifically, Visa and MasterCard rules require Merchants to accept all devices set up to transact through a Visa or MasterCard 
network to the extent the Merchant accepts payments using communications technology employed by the device. This results in 
a Merchant having limited ability to refuse or condition acceptance of payments from digital wallets."").) "
473,27," Direct Action Plaintiffs contend that Plaintiffs propose a plan to have the Court monitor agreements reached between a 
merchant and Defendants argue that this plan violates the Rules Enabling Act because it ""seeks to abridge the Direct Action 
Plaintiffs' substantive rights and prohibit[s] them from continuing to litigate their own claims for past and future damages[] or 
reach[ing] individual settlements resolving those claims."" (Direct Action Pls.' Opp'n 14.) Walmart contends that Plaintiffs will 
""likely seek an injunction that effectively prevent[] merchants from trying to use what bargaining power they have to secure lower 
interchange rates for themselves."" (Walmart's Opp'n 8; Walmart's Suppl. Opp'n 4-5.) For the same reasons discussed above, 
the Court finds these arguments regarding the propriety of any proposed injunctive relief premature."
473,28," The Second Circuit later abrogated Visa Check/MasterMoney on other grounds. See In re Initial Pub. Offerings Sec. Litig., 471 
F.3d 24, 32, 42 (2d Cir. 2006), decision clarified on denial of reh'g sub nom. In re Initial Pub. Offering Sec. Litig., 483 F.3d 70 (2d 
Cir. 2007). The abrogation concerned the proper standard for demonstrating compliance with Rule 23's requirements on a 
motion for class certification and ""disavowed the suggestion . . . that an expert's testimony may establish a component of a Rule 
23 requirement simply by being not fatally flawed."" Id. "
477,29," The Court notes that while the antitrust claims in In re Vitamin C Antitrust Litigation were later dismissed by the Second Circuit 
on international comity grounds, the court's class certification decision was not before the Second Circuit on appeal. See In re 
Vitamin C Antitrust Litig., 8 F.4th 136, 143 (2d Cir. 2021) (""[W]e hold that principles of international comity required the district 
court to dismiss this action.""). "
480,30," The other cases cited by Direct Action Plaintiffs are similarly distinguishable. In Slamon v. Carrizo (Marcellus) LLC, while the 
court stated that ""the individual lease holders must have the right to opt-out, and the absence of the ability to do so severely 
prejudice[d] their rights and also risk[ed] subjecting them, without their consent, to the doctrines of issue preclusion and collateral 
estoppel,"" the court also found that the injunctive relief sought ""relate[d] predominantly to money damages"" and failed the test 
set forth in Rule 23(b)(2). No. 16-CV-2187, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87149, 2020 WL 2525961, at *16 (M.D. Pa. May 18, 2020). 
Richardson v. L'Oreal USA, Inc. is inapposite because that case involved certification of a (b)(2) settlement class in which the 
settlement released ""class-wide damages claims, but not individual damages claims,"" which the court found was improper under 
Rule 23(b)(2) under Shutts and Dukes. 991 F. Supp. 2d 181, 198-99 (D.D.C. 2013). "
482,31," The parties' arguments regarding whether there is a risk that class representatives and counsel will trade claims also address 
whether the Court should permit opt-out rights. The Court addresses the opt-out arguments in Section II.e infra. "
483,32," The other cases cited by Opponents are similarly inapposite. For example, in In re Literary Works in Electronic Databases 
Copyright Litigation, the Second Circuit held that there was a fundamental conflict sufficient to preclude adequacy of 
representation when there were three subclasses and each subclass's ""interests diverge[d] as to the distribution of that recovery 
because each category of claim [was] of different strength and therefore command[ed] a different settlement value. Named 
plaintiffs who hold other combinations of claims had no incentive to maximize the recovery for Category C-only plaintiffs, whose 
claims were lowest in settlement value but eclipsed all others in quantity."" 654 F.3d 242, 254 (2d Cir. 2011). Like Dukes and 
Interchange Fees II, the court found that the ""interests of Category C-only plaintiffs could be protected only by the formation of a 
subclass and the advocacy of independent counsel."" Id. Accordingly, Literary Works did not address whether class counsel 
might be incentivized or empowered to trade away claims that are not included within the class's suit. Similarly, Opponents take 
the language in Cholakyan out of context. (See Direct Action Plaintiffs' Opp'n 19; Grubhub Pls.' Opp'n 13.) In that case, while the 
court spoke of concerns that the class representative and his counsel were ""willing potentially to sacrifice individual class 
members' right to pursue the recovery of monetary damages,"" the court addressed such conflicts in the context of claim splitting 
and preclusion, not as to whether class representatives and counsel would make improper tradeoffs with claims pursued by 
parties outside of the class. See Cholakyan, 281 F.R.D. at 565. "
490,33," In Comcast, the plaintiffs presented four theories of antitrust liability, with a damages model that calculated damages for the 
entire class based on all four theories. Comcast Corp. v. Behrend, 569 U.S. 27, 32, 133 S. Ct. 1426, 185 L. Ed. 2d 515 (2013). 
The district court accepted only one of the liability theories, rejecting the other three. Id. However, the plaintiffs' calculation 
method for damages did not isolate damages for each of the four theories, and the district court refused to review the 
inconsistency between the sole liability theory and the damages methodology, which was based on all four liability theories, on 
the grounds that doing so would require reaching the merits of the claims. Id. The Supreme Court held that because the court 
approved only one of the four antitrust liability theories, the plaintiffs could not rely on a model that included damages for all four 
antitrust theories. Id. at 37. Thus, the Court understands Comcast to require courts to ensure consistency between the liability 
theory and damages proposed by the putative class. Although Comcast did not focus on class definition, it is relevant to the 
question of class boundaries because the Supreme Court reasoned that only damages that can be attributed to the defendant's 
misconduct should be considered. Id. at 38 (""Prices whose level above what an expert deems 'competitive' has been caused by 
factors unrelated to an accepted theory of antitrust harm are not 'anticompetitive' in any sense relevant here.""). "
491,34," In re Petrobras Securities was a securities class action brought by Petrobras shareholders alleging that Petrobras made 
misleading statements that impacted the price of shares. 862 F.3d 250 (2d Cir. 2017). The Second Circuit noted that the class 
definition was temporally limited to securities purchases made ""before Petrobras made generally available to its security holders 
an earnings statement covering a period of at least twelve months beginning after the effective date of the offerings,"" and that 
such limitation was appropriate ""given the absence of any allegation that Plaintiffs relied on any such earnings statement."" Id. at 
259-60. "
493,35," Although Merchant Trade Groups make their arguments in the context of requesting opt-out rights and not arguing that 
Plaintiffs do not satisfy Rule 23(b)(2), (see Merchant Trade Groups' Opp'n 9-10), the Court finds their arguments relevant for the 
Rule 23(b)(2) inquiry. "
495,36," The Court notes that in approving the 2013 Settlement Agreement, Judge Gleeson held that ""the class is sufficiently cohesive 
to warrant Rule 23(b)(2) relief in this case."" See Interchange Fees I, 986 F. Supp. 2d at 239. However, Judge Gleeson appeared 
to use the word ""cohesive"" in the same manner that this Court interprets it — to describe a class that meets the requirements of 
Rule 23(b)(2) because ""the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so 
that final injunctive relief . . . is appropriate respecting the class as a whole."" Id. (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2)). "
499,37," The Court notes that Rule 23(e) requires that (b)(2) class members receive notice of any proposed settlement and Rule 23(h) 
requires that (b)(2) class members receive notice of any claim for an attorneys' fees award. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e), (h)."
499,38," Another case cited by Merchant Trade Groups is similarly unpersuasive. In Friedman v. California State Employees 
Association, the court provided opt-out rights to a Rule 23(b)(2) class for members who ""object[ed] to the portion of the action 
pertaining to the challenge to the constitutionality"" of a statute because ""some fair share fee payers [were] happy to pay their fair 
share of union dues to cover the benefits of collective bargaining and [did] not want the statute to be overturned."" No. CV-
S000101, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7049, 2000 WL 288468, at *8 (E.D. Cal. Mar. 15, 2000). The Court finds the facts of this case 
inapposite because in the instant litigation, no merchant is seeking opt-out rights to uphold the Restraints. "
500,39," While the Court is mindful of the Second Circuit's warning that litigation peace does not warrant certification of an unlawful 
class, see Interchange Fees II, 827 F.3d at 240 (""[T]he benefits of litigation peace do not outweigh class members' due process 
right to adequate representation.""), the Court considers potential obstacles to settlement because it is satisfied that the 
representation is adequate under Rule 23(a)(4) and the Due Process Clause. "
501,40," Direct Action Plaintiffs' remaining arguments that their inclusion in a mandatory class violates their constitutional rights are 
similarly meritless. Direct Action Plaintiffs argue that (1) ""[c]ertification of mandatory classes implicates Seventh Amendment jury 
trial rights"" because ""[w]hen cases involve legal and equitable claims that share common factual issues, the Seventh 
Amendment requires a jury trial on the legal claims first,"" and (2) forcing them to participate in a mandatory class ""would violate 
their due process right to choose their own counsel, and their First Amendment rights to free speech and freedom of association 
by requiring them to be represented by counsel they did not choose."" (Direct Action Pls.' Opp'n 10.) In response, Plaintiffs argue that ""[i]t is black-letter law that the application of collateral estoppel does not implicate the Seventh 
Amendment"" and the First Amendment arguments are ""overblown at best"" with Direct Action Plaintiffs citing ""no case holding 
that such rights are impaired by certifying a mandatory (b)(2) class."" (Pls.' Reply 9-10 & n.15.) Defendants similarly contend that 
any resulting collateral estoppel as a result of the Court's determination does not violate the Seventh Amendment because the 
Seventh Amendment only requires a jury trial when claims for damages and injunctive relief are tried in the same action. (Defs.' 
Reply 13-14.) The Court agrees with Rule 23(b)(2) Plaintiffs and Defendants that certification of a mandatory class does not violate the right to 
a jury trial for parties pursuing individual damages claims. The Supreme Court has held that ""an equitable determination can 
have collateral estoppel effect in a subsequent legal action and . . . this estoppel does not violate the Seventh Amendment."" 
Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, 439 U.S. 322, 335, 99 S. Ct. 645, 58 L. Ed. 2d 552 (1979); Falbaum v. Pomerantz, 19 F. App'x 
10, 12-13 (2d Cir. 2001) (stating that in Parklane Hoisery, ""the Supreme Court held that the Seventh Amendment did not prevent 
the application of collateral estoppel to a second action even though the first action was determined by a judge"" when there were 
""two separate actions as is the case here""). Direct Action Plaintiffs' First Amendment argument is similarly unavailing. Direct Action Plaintiffs cite no case, and this Court is 
aware of none, concluding that mandatory actions under Rule 23(b)(2) implicate free speech and freedom of association. See 
Ayers v. Thompson, 358 F.3d 356, 376 (5th Cir. 2004) (rejecting the appellants' argument that denying them opt-out rights raises 
a First Amendment issue and stating that they ""provide no authority for the proposition that denying them the right to opt out of a 
Rule 23(b)(2) class violates the First Amendment""). However, should Direct Action Plaintiffs wish to litigate this issue, they 
should address it in a more comprehensive manner than just providing a single sentence and footnote in their motion papers. "
506,1," All of the defendants, except one, were dismissed with prejudice. VLSI was dismissed without prejudice."
506,2, This is because only VLSI has sued Intel for patent infringement. . 
508,3," Per the SAC, Fortress formed VLSI in 2016 and caused the transfer of patents to the company. See SAC ¶ 74. VLSI obtained

552,1," Defendant Lockheed Martin Corporation's Motion to Dismiss, Dkt. 58, argues that this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction 
under the Foreign Sovereign Immunity Act. Defendant Airbus SAS's Motion to Dismiss, Dkt. 66, argues that this Court lacks 
subject matter jurisdiction under the Sherman Act. Each Defendant adopts the other's arguments on these fronts. "
565,1," As detailed in the SAC, ""Plaintiffs"" include (1) Fund Liquidation Holdings LLC (""FLH"") as assignee and successor-in-interest to 
Sonterra Capital Master Fund, Ltd., (2) Hayman Capital Master Fund, L.P. (""HCMF""), (3) Japan Macro Opportunities Master 
Fund, L.P. (""JMOF""), and (4) California State Teachers' Retirement System (""CalSTRS""). "
566,2," Given the lengthy procedural history and factual background, the Court assumes familiarity and only repeats the most salient 
aspects thereof to the instant motion. "
568,3," Defendants also contend that Sonterra lacked standing because it assigned its claims prior to suit. (Id. at 11.) The Second 
Circuit, similarly, rejected this argument, reasoning that Sonterra's pre-suit assignment of its claims to FLH ""does not pose a 
constitutional roadblock"" to Article III standing. SIBOR, 991 F.3d at 382. "
569,4," Defendants also cite GBP LIBOR and SIBOR I in support of their contention that the APA does not convey RICO claims. (Defs.' 
Br. at 18 n.19.) For the reasons explained, these cases are inapposite."
569,5," Contrary to Plaintiffs' contention, SIBOR does not ""fully support[]"" FLH's substitution for Sonterra. (Letter, dated March 23, 
2021, ECF No. 555.) In Sibor, the Second Circuit referenced the district court's preliminary determination regarding Sonterra's 
assignment to FLH. SIBOR, 991 F.3d at 392 (citing FrontPoint Asian Event Driven Fund, L.P. v. Citibank, N.A. (""SIBOR I""), No. 
16 Civ. 5263 (AKH), 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 171999, 2018 WL 4830087, at *11-12 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 4, 2018) (granting leave to 
amend the complaint after concluding that ""[t]he documents 'appear' to show a full assignment"")). The district court, however, did 
not fully address whether the APA effectively assigned the claims there because it dismissed Sonterra after finding it was not an 
efficient enforcer. Fund Liquidation Holdings LLC v. Citibank NA., 399 F. Supp, 3d 94, 99 (S.D.N.Y. 2019), vacated and 
remanded sub nom. Fund Liquidation Holdings LLC v. Bank of Am. Corp., 991 F.3d 370 (2d Cir. 2021) (explaining that in SIBOR 
I, the court granted leave to amend and instructed Plaintiffs to ""show how they got their assignment"" and give an 
""interpretation""); see also id. at 104 (declining to address whether the effectivity of Sonterra's assignment because the court 
dismissed Sonterra's claims). "
570,6," Defendants' contention that relation back is inapplicable because the present antitrust claim does not arise out of the conduct, 
transaction or occurrence of the original pleading is rejected. (Defs.' Br. at 23 n.26.)"
570,7," Given the Second Circuit's decision in SIBOR, this Court's reasoning regarding the Hayman Funds applies with equal weight to 
Plaintiff CalSTRS. Accordingly, Defendants' motion to dismiss CalSTRS for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is denied. "
571,8," Defendants' reliance on Laydon is misplaced. There, the chain of causation was further attenuated by plaintiff's failure to ""point 
to any direct, clearly traceable means by which Defendants' alleged manipulation of one benchmark led to a loss to him on 
contracts linked to an entirely separate benchmark."" Laydon v. Mizuho Bank, Ltd., No. 12 Civ. 3419, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
46368, 2014 WL 1280464, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 28, 2014). Likewise, 7 W. 57th Street Realty Co. v. Citigroup, Inc. is inapposite 
because the bonds at issue there ""were not actually tied to LIBOR"" whereas here, Plaintiffs have alleged that Yen LIBOR is 
incorporated implicitly into their transactions through a complex formula involving a number of other causal factors. 771 F. App'x 
498 (2d Cir. 2019). While these vaguely defined links present a hurdle for Plaintiffs to overcome regarding causation, this hurdle 
presents more of an issue for umbrella standing than for those claims against Defendants that Plaintiffs directly transacted with. "
572,9," In light of this Court's findings above regarding antitrust standing, this Court only examines whether Plaintiffs have sufficiently 
pleaded an antitrust conspiracy with regard to the following Defendants: RBS Plc, Société Générale, UBS AG, Merrill Lynch 
International, and Barclays Bank Plc. "
573,10," It is worth noting that the antitrust conspiracy as alleged—a sweeping, long running conspiracy to ""make false submissions to 
the BBA designed to artificially suppress, inflate, maintain, or otherwise alter Yen-LIBOR""—is simply implausible when viewed as 
a whole. As Judge Stein explained, and as suggested in Gelboim, ""it is harder to infer a conspiracy from individual acts of trader-
based manipulation because large financial institutions are both buyers and sellers of derivative products, and thus any changes 
may well offset each other. But assuming that an upward or downward shift would provide a net increase in profit to a particular 
bank, one would need to further assume that the same shift would benefit each member of the conspiracy. Unless the banks are 
similarly situated in this respect, there would be no evident common motive to conspire. This particularly undermines the 
inference of a conspiracy when the simpler explanation is that the banks may have been independently engaging in intra-
defendant manipulation by submitting false [Yen] LIBOR quotes through requests from their own traders to those in the same 
bank who submit the quote to the BBA."" Sonterra Cap. Master Fund Ltd. v. Credit Suisse Grp. AG, 277 F. Supp. 3d 521, 555 
(S.D.N.Y. 2017) (""CHF LIBOR""). The SAC offers no explanation why conspiracy, as alleged, would be plausible. Consequently, 
Plaintiffs may not ""shoehorn each"" Defendant into the conspiracy absent Defendant specific allegations of collusion. Alaska 
Dep't of Revenue, Treasury Div. v. Manku, No. 20-1759-CV, 2021 U.S. App. LEXIS 21219, 2021 WL 3027170, at *4 (2d Cir. July 
19, 2021) (""SSA Bonds"") (noting Plaintiffs' failure ""to link each of the defendants individually to specific acts of anticompetitive 
conduct in furtherance of the conspiracy."") "
574,11," Contrary to Defendants' contention, SSA Bonds does not lead to a dismissal of Plaintiffs' entire antitrust claim. There, the 
Second Circuit, affirmed the dismissal of an antitrust claim where plaintiffs alleged a ""single, unitary super-desk"" conspiracy 
involving ""more than twenty entities . . . conspiring every day, nearly all day"" in a ""decentralized, opaque, and frenetic"" 
secondary market for U.S. dollar-denominated supranational, sovereign, and agency bonds. While this Court questioned the 
plausibility of Plaintiffs' conspiracy as to all Defendants, unlike plaintiffs in SSA Bonds, Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged 
collusion on a smaller scale and have not ""explicitly refused to plead . . . a narrower antitrust conspiracy."" SSA Bonds, 2021 U.S. 
App. LEXIS 21219, 2021 WL 3027170, at *2, *4. "
575,12," Accordingly, Plaintiffs' reliance on various criminal cases to contend that their claims are not extraterritorial is misplaced, as 
this Court previously held in Laydon. Laydon [*31]  v. Mizuho Bank, Ltd., No. 12 Civ. 3419 (GBD), ECF No. 491, at 3 n.3 
(S.D.N.Y. July 24, 2015) (""To be within the domestic reach of the wire fraud statute, is not the same as overcoming the 
presumption against extraterritoriality in the RICO context."") (internal quotation marks omitted). "
576,13," Consequently, this Court need not address Defendants remaining arguments regarding these claims."
576,14," The SAC does not allege which law governs CalSTRS's contracts with these Defendants but both patties cite New York law in 
their briefs. "
578,15," Contrary to Plaintiffs' contention, ""jurisdiction lies only in cases in which the venue provision of Section 12, not the general 
venue statute, is satisfied."" Dennis v. JPMorgan Chase & Co., 345 F. Supp. 3d 122, 198 (S.D.N.Y. 2018). Indeed, ""the operative 
language for purposes of personal jurisdiction is found in the second half of the statute - that is, the service provision, which 
states that 'all process in such cases may be served in the district of which it is an inhabitant, or wherever it may be found.' The 
Second Circuit has construed 'in such cases' in accordance with its plain language."" Id. (citation omitted). Thus, the general 
venue statute is inapplicable."
578,16," Defendants' contention that Plaintiffs' claims are time barred and thus, warrant dismissal, is rejected. (Defs.' Br. at 19.) The 
SAC adequately alleges that Plaintiff CalSTRS's claims were tolled by the fraudulent concealment doctrine. Plaintiff 
demonstrates that Defendants concealed the existence of its cause of action, that Plaintiff remained in ignorance and Plaintiffs 
ignorance was not attributable to lack of diligence. "
590,1," As noted above, the Complaint alleges that some data cannot simply be extracted from the PowerPlan software because the 
software is so obsolete and uses an old coding language. (Compl. ¶ 23.) "
593,2," In Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir. 1981) (en banc), the Eleventh Circuit adopted as binding 
precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down prior to October 1, 1981. "
594,3," Lucasys further alleges that software competition ""in the Supplemental Management Services Market is the most likely route for 
a potential competitor in the Utility Management Software market to achieve sufficient scale to threaten PowerPlan's monopoly. 
Thus, Powerplan's modus operandi of allowing consulting competition in the Supplemental Management Services market but 
thwarting through anticompetitive conduct all software competition in that market, effectively protects its monopoly"" in the Utility 
Software Market. (Compl. ¶ 62.)"
594,4," Also relevant, as noted in the above Factual Background, Lucasys alleges that PowerPlan's software that houses customers' 
data is based on an outdated coding language and therefore customer data cannot simply be exported to make calculations 
elsewhere. (Compl. ¶ 23.) Lucasys alleges that it needs access to its customers' data in order to design and develop solutions to 
meet customers' needs and also to provide consulting services. (Id. ¶ 60.) "
596,5," The Court notes that all of PowerPlan's cited cases, in which courts found a lack of preparedness, were before the court on 
summary judgment. PowerPlan's dearth of authority arising at the motion to dismiss stage only reinforces the Court's finding at 
this juncture."
596,6," In its Motion to Dismiss, PowerPlan argues that Lucasys fails to allege injury to competition in the Deferred Tax Market in 
Section 3 of its brief. (Mot. at 22.) As reasoned infra, however, the Court finds that Plaintiff has adequately pled the contours of 
the Deferred Tax Market and therefore addresses issues of whether Plaintiff has sufficiently pled harm to competition in both 
markets together."
596,7," PowerPlan does not argue that Lucasys fails to allege harm to competition in the Utility Software Market or argue for dismissal 
of Counts I and II on that basis. Counts I and II assert § 2 violations for unlawful maintenance of a monopoly. Accordingly, the 
Court does not assess those claims here or the issue of harm to competition in the Utility Software Market. "
598,8," See also Restore Robotics, LLC v. Intuitive Surgical, Inc., 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 228084, 2019 WL 8063989, at *4 (N.D. Fla. 
Sept. 16, 2019) (finding that plaintiff adequately alleged injury to competition where it alleged that tying and exclusive dealing 
arrangements harmed competition in the aftermarkets in general even though plaintiff was still able to ""compete some"" with 
defendant's anticompetitive conduct); CollegeNet, Inc. v. Common Application, Inc., 355 F. Supp. 3d 926, 950 (D. Or. 2018) 
(finding that plaintiff had adequately plead anticompetitive effect where, as a result of allegedly unlawful tying of products, 
members were coerced into agreeing not to purchase higher-quality, more innovative, or lower-priced college application 
processing services from rival); Epic Games, Inc. v. Apple Inc., 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 172303, 2021 WL 4128925, at *101 (N.D. 
Cal. Sept. 10, 2021) (finding that plaintiff had shown anticompetitive harm to competition by showing that Apple precluded 
developers from opening competing game stores, which would have increased competition and reduced prices and even 
improved innovation) . "
602,9," PowerPlan also argued that Lucasys failed to adequately allege harm to the Deferred Tax Market. (Mot. at 21-22.) But, as 
detailed in Section B., supra, Plaintiff has adequately pled injury to competition in this market based on allegations similar to the 
ones related to the Supplemental Market. "
603,10," Without using this explicit language, PowerPlan argues that it had an interest in Lucasys' relationships because, under its 
separate contracts with customers, it has the power to protect its interest in PowerPlan confidential information. (Reply at 14-15.) 
But, taking the allegations in the Complaint as true at this stage, ""neither Lucasys not any other customer or third party can 
obtain proprietary information simply by accessing customer data through PowerPlan's software."" (Compl. ¶ 54.) PowerPlan's 
assertions of trade secret concerns were, according to the Complaint, baseless and concocted, (id.), and thus not direct or 
legitimate. For this reason, PowerPlan's reliance on CAE Inc. v. Gulfstream Aero. Corp., 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 124573, at *20-
23 (D. Del. Aug. 2, 2017), an unreported case cited in its reply brief, is misplaced. There, the contract at issue involved a third 
party's agreement to provide plaintiff with defendant's data. 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 124573, [WL] at *3-6. Here, Lucasys' contract 
with AEP (or others) was not for the provision of PowerPlan's data, i.e., PowerPlan's data was not the direct subject of any 
agreement. Instead, Lucasys' agreement with AEP was for separate services that involved accessing customer data which 
indirectly involved access to PowerPlan software (but not in a manner that would allow a third party to obtain proprietary 
information, see Compl. ¶ 54). "
609,1," The Court has subject matter jurisdiction over Sherman Act and Clayton Act claims under 28 U.S.C. § 1331, and supplemental

brief, Defendants seem to suggest that they raised lack of Article III standing in their initial Motion for Summary Judgment. (DE 
68 at 1). However, Defendants' initial motion contains no legal argument for lack of Article III standing, nor does it cite to any law 
on Article III standing. My ruling on the standing issue here is therefore confined to only the standing argument Defendants 
actually raised and briefed. "
620,3," In Maralago II, Plaintiff added an additional defendant which it has since dismissed. (DE 40)."
620,4," I note that Defendants attached the Maralago I complaint as an exhibit to the Declaration of J. Allen Bobo. (DE 55-1). For the 
sake of clarity, I will cite to the Maralago I complaint directly instead of the page numbers in the exhibit. "
621,5," Plaintiff does not explicitly raise this argument for res judicata purposes but does with respect to claim splitting. Given the 
doctrinal overlap between res judicata and claim splitting, I will address this argument here."
621,6," For example, the 4-5% annual lot rental increase since 2016 (DE 1-1 at ¶ 58) and the alleged efforts to implement the ""state-
wide adoption of the LTA by other [unnamed] mobile home park owners"" (id. at ¶ 46)."
621,7," Plaintiff also argues that the Maralago I court ""struck the LTA and all references of the LTA from the Complaint before entering"" 
the dismissal order (DE 61 at 1), seemingly finding it relevant that this issue was not litigated at the motion to dismiss stage. 
However, whether an issue was actually litigated is relevant to issue preclusion, not claim preclusion. See Sellers v. Nationwide 
Mut. Fire Ins. Co., 968 F.3d 1267 (11th Cir. 2020). "
622,8," Plaintiff argues that the Maralago I court did not intend for the overall dismissal to operate as an adjudication on the merits, 
because in footnote 3 the court ""expressly declined to address the Defendants' argument that Plaintiff failed to state a claim 
upon which relief can be granted."" (DE 61 2). That is not so. The Maralago I court declined to rule on Defendants' 12(b)(6) 
argument only with respect to the ADA claim because it found that Plaintiffs lacked standing to bring that specific "
623,9," Plaintiff initially named an additional defendant, against which Plaintiff dismissed all claims on July 31, 2021. (DE 40). Neither 
party argues that the dismissed defendant should presently be considered a co-conspirator; as such, I decline to reach that 
question and analyze only the relationships among the remaining Defendants."

due consideration and great weight be given to the interpretations of the federal courts relating to comparable federal antitrust 
statutes."" Fla. Stat. § 542.32. "
624,11," Plaintiff cites to several Supreme Court cases for the opposite proposition—that ""[t]he fact that there is common ownership or 
control of the contracting corporations does not 'liberate them from the impact of the antitrust laws.'"" (DE 61 at 5 (quoting Kiefer-
Stewart Co. v. Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, Inc., 340 U.S. 211, 71 S. Ct. 259, 95 L. Ed. 219 (1951) and citing Timken Co. v.

629,1," The caption to the Amended Complaint names CDI twice, first as a dissolved Colorado limited liability company and second as 
a Florida limited liability company. [#87] Nonetheless, the Amended Complaint treats CDI as a single entity and does not 
distinguish between the dissolved entity and the operating entity. [See generally id.]"
629,2," It appears from the Amended Complaint that Claims One, Two, Four, Five, Nine, Eleven, and Twelve are all asserted against 
Mr. Dieter. [See generally #87] CDI's Motion states that during conferral with Plaintiffs' counsel, Plaintiffs' counsel indicated that 
only Claims Two, Nine, Eleven, and Twelve were asserted against Mr. Dieter in his personal capacity. [#89 at 1] Plaintiffs' 
Response does not challenge this assertion. [See generally #100] Nonetheless, during oral argument, Plaintiffs' counsel 
indicated that he had not intended to concede the additional claims apparently alleged against Mr. Dieter. As a result, out of an 
abundance of caution, the Court will analyze whether Plaintiff has plausibly alleged Claims One, Four, and Five against Mr. 
Dieter. "
630,3," The facts in this Section are drawn from the allegations in Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint [#87], which must be taken as true 
when considering IDT's Motion to Dismiss and CDI's Motion to Dismiss. See Wilson v. Montano, 715 F.3d 847, 850 n.1 (10th 
Cir. 2013) (citing Brown v. Montoya, 662 F.3d 1152, 1162 (10th Cir. 2011))."
630,4," The Complaint has two sets of Paragraphs 1-5. In this instance, the Court cites to the second set of Paragraphs 1 and 2."
630,5," In this instance, the Court cites to the second Paragraph 2."
630,6," In this instance, the Court cites to the second Paragraph 3."
630,7," In this instance, the Court cites to the second set of Paragraphs 3 and 5."
630,8," In this instance, the Court cites to the second Paragraph 4."
630,9," In this instance, the Court cites to the first Paragraph 1."
630,10," The Agreement was referenced as an attachment to the Amended Complaint [##87, ¶ 20; 80-2] and is therefore properly 
considered by the Court in evaluating both IDT's Motion to Dismiss and CDI's Motion to Dismiss. Smith v. United States, 561 
F.3d 1090, 1098 (10th Cir. 2009) (""In evaluating a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, courts may consider not only the complaint 
itself, but also attached exhibits . . . and documents incorporated into the complaint by reference."" (citations omitted)). "
631,11," The Court has done its best to attempt to reconstruct the exact timeline of events outlined in the Amended Complaint. The 
Amended Complaint is often disjointed—jumping from one timeframe to another—and it is difficult to determine when various 
actions were alleged to have occurred."
631,12," The Amended Complaint identifies Ms. Rumero as an ""employee"" but does not indicate whether she was an employee of IDT 
or CDI. [Id. at ¶ 3] Given that Plaintiffs allege that Ms. Rumero ""performed the bulk of the work in stealing Plaintiffs' retailers"" [id. 
at ¶ 90], Plaintiffs failure to precisely identify Ms. Rumero's employer is especially troubling. It appears from CDI's counterclaims 
that Ms. Rumero is CDI's Sales Director. [#90 at ¶ 24]"
631,13," In this instance, the Court cites to the first Paragraph 3."
631,14," Again, it is not clear from the Amended Complaint whether this was a new ""scheme"" or was merely a continuation of the 
actions that allegedly began in 2014. This distinction does not affect the Court's analysis."
631,15," Once again, the Amended Complaint rarely provides specific dates and instead generally refers to the four-year timeframe of 
2014-2018. "
632,16," From the Amended Complaint, it is impossible to determine whether this incident occurred before or after CDI and IDT 
stopped providing leads. It is likewise impossible to determine whether this incident occurred before or after the correspondence 
described below."
632,17," In this instance, the Court cites to the first Paragraph 2."
632,18," Although the Amended Complaint alleges that both IDT and CDI were involved in these calls, the only individuals specifically 
identified as having made the calls are Mr. Dieter and Ms. Rumero. [Id. at ¶¶ 83, 85-95]"
632,19," It is possible, though far from clear from the Amended Complaint, that Ms. Rumero—the person who is alleged to have been 
primarily involved in the conversations with retailers [id. at ¶ 90]—may have allegedly engaged in other actions related to the 
retailers besides offering the retailers better rates. In Paragraph 96, Plaintiffs allege verbatim: ""At times, during her visit, Ms. 
Rumero, acting on the orders of Defendants, would make changes to the retailers' account with the ultimate goal of changing the 
retailers' account number to make it appear as if there was no."" [Id. at ¶ 96] And that is where the sentence ends. The Court is 
left to forever wonder why Ms. Rumero would allegedly change the retailers' account numbers. In the next two paragraphs, 
Plaintiffs allege that Ms. Rumero made various representations and omissions, but do not identify these representations and 
omissions. [Id. at ¶¶ 97-98] The Court does not know whether these representations or omissions were supposed to have been 
included in the unfinished Paragraph 96, or whether Paragraphs 97 and 98 are merely conclusory statements."
632,20," The Amended Complaint refers to the date of this letter as both ""August 24, 2015"" and ""August 24, 2014."" [#87 at ¶¶ 104-105] 
The Court assumes, based on the dates provided in the surrounding paragraphs, that the correct year is 2015. "
633,21," The facts in this Section are drawn from the allegations in CDI's Counterclaims [#90 at 17-22], which must be taken as true 
when considering Plaintiffs' Motion to Dismiss. See Wilson, 715 F.3d at 850 n.1. "
636,22," The Amended Complaint states: ""IDT developed the Service, but IDT could not sell the service without distributors. IDT 
contracted with CDI and with Plaintiffs to distribute the Service."" [#87 at ¶ 10] But this does not allege that IDT gave CDI 
permission to contract on its behalf; it alleges only that CDI's contract with IDT permitted CDI to take additional actions in order 
to distribute the Service. And the conclusory statement that IDT contracted with Plaintiffs is insufficient to demonstrate an actual 
contract where the Agreement does not include IDT as a party and the Amended Complaint fails to allege the terms of any other 
agreement—oral or written—between IDT and Plaintiffs. "
637,23," ""Although an accounting is an extraordinary remedy, it may be ordered if the plaintiff is unable to determine how much, if any, 
money is due him or her from another."" Patterson v. BP Am. Prod. Co., 159 P.3d 634, 642 (Colo. App. 2006), overruled on other 
grounds by 185 P.3d 811 (Colo. 2008) (citing Andrikopoulos v. Broadmoor Mgmt. Co., 670 P.2d 435 (Colo. App. 1983)). ""Under 
Colorado law, a demand for an accounting and a refusal to comply with the demand must be pleaded and proved."" Postal 
Instant Press v. Jackson, 658 F. Supp. 739, 743 (D. Colo. 1987) (citing Am. Woodmen's Life Ins. Co. v. Supreme Camp of Am. 
Woodmen, 37 Colo. App. 311, 549 P.2d 423, 425 (Colo. App. 1976)). However, exceptions to the pre-suit demand requirement 
apply where preclusion of the accounting claim would be unreasonable, such as where the accounting claim is ancillary to a 
breach of contract claim and its main purpose is to facilitate an accurate calculation of damages once the breach of contract is 
found. See Kirzhner v. Silverstein, 09-CV-02858-CMA, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 74963, 2010 WL 2985615, at *12 (D. Colo. July 
23, 2010); Patterson, 159 P.3d 634 at 642. Here, Plaintiffs' accounting claim centers on its assertion that the Agreement requires 
CDI and IDT to provide records regarding commissions due under the Agreement. [#87 at ¶ 219] But because Plaintiffs have not 
sufficiently alleged that IDT was a party to the Agreement, they are not entitled to an accounting from IDT. "
638,24," Nor does the ""exclusivity"" provision of the Agreement make the interference improper. Initially, the Agreement appears to 
disclaim any exclusivity, specifically stating that the ""Agreement shall not confer upon [Plaintiffs] any type of exclusive right 
pertaining to the marketing and sale of the Service and CDI and IDT shall retain the right to enter into the same or similar 
arrangements with other entities."" [#80-2 at 4] But, in any event, as detailed above, IDT was not a party to the Agreement and 
therefore cannot have acted improperly by failing to comply with the terms of the Agreement."
638,25," As explained earlier, in Paragraph 96 of the Amended Complaint, Plaintiff alleges: ""At times, during her visit, Ms. Rumero, 
acting on the orders of Defendants, would make changes to the retailers' account with the ultimate goal of changing the retailers' 
account number to make it appear as if there was no."" [Id. at ¶ 96] But the sentence ends without explaining the changes to the 
retailers' accounts or how those changes were fraudulent. "
640,26," During oral argument, Plaintiff argued that vertical arrangements could indeed support a per se violation and relied on 
Budicak, Inc. v. Lansing Trade Grp., LLC for the proposition that ""a typical price-fixing claim involves collusion . . . between two 
levels in the same supply chain for a particular product (vertical price-fixing)."" 452 F. Supp. 3d 1029, 1054 (D. Kan. 2020). But 
the Budicak court, too, determined that ""the Court has uncovered [no cases] where a court afforded per se analysis to a price-
fixing conspiracy between non-competitors."" Id."

418, 296 P.2d 742, 745 (Colo. 1956). "
641,29," The Agreement states that CDI and IDT shall ""upon request, provide [Plaintiffs] with such other records as are necessary to 
show the amount of [c]ommissions that [Plaintiffs] and [r]etailers within [Plaintiffs'] [n]etwork are entitled to receive under this 
Agreement."" [#80-2 at 4]"
641,30," In their response, besides providing citations to the law on fiduciary relationships generally, Plaintiffs' sole statement in support 
of their fiduciary duty claim is that it ""is related to Plaintiffs' claims for conversion and civil theft."" [#100 at 13] This statement does 
not provide the Court any assistance in analyzing Plaintiffs' fiduciary duty claim. "
642,31," Although IDT states in its Motion that the Amended Complaint does not allege any unlawful act, IDT does not elaborate on, 
nor provide support for, this assertion. [#88 at 17]"
642,32," Colorado courts have left open the possibility that a claim for civil conspiracy to a breach of contract could be pursued against 
a non-party to the contract, Logixx Automation v. Lawrence Michels Fam. Tr., 56 P.3d 1224, 1232 (Colo. App. 2002), and courts 
in this district have reached conflicting results on this topic, Ubel v. Progressive Direct Ins. Co., No. 20-cv-00204-RM-NYW, 2020 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 213414, 2020 WL 9432929, at *22 (D. Colo. Oct. 22, 2020), report and recommendation adopted, 2020 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 212329, 2020 WL 6701102 (D. Colo. Nov. 13, 2020) (civil conspiracy claim cannot be premised upon a conspiracy 
to breach a contract, even against non-signatories); McNees v. Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC, No. 16-cv-1055-WJM-KLM, 2019 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 67830, 2019 WL 1762947, at *12 (D. Colo. Apr. 22, 2019) (same); Bituminous Cas. Corp. v. Hartford Cas. Ins. 
Co., No. 12-cv-000433-WYD-KLM, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16096, 2013 WL 452374, at *10 (D. Colo. Feb. 6, 2013) (civil 
conspiracy claim may be premised upon a conspiracy to breach a contract provided the claim is brought against a nonparty to 
the contract). Because IDT has not briefed this issue, and because at least one other overt act is proceeding, the Court will not 
reach whether civil conspiracy for breach of contract can be pursued against IDT. "
643,33," IDT argues that Plaintiffs failed to allege a specific contract that IDT interfered with and that, in any event, Plaintiffs failed to 
allege that IDT ""possessed sufficient authority to significantly interfere with contracts between Plaintiffs and their alleged 
retailers, or that IDT actually exercised that authority to . . . [Plaintiffs'] detriment."" [#88 at 18 (quotations omitted)] But while the 
Amended Complaint does rely upon the contracts with the retailers in support of Plaintiffs' Section 1981 claims, it also cites to 
CDI's termination of the Agreement. [#87 at ¶ 227] And the Amended Complaint does plausibly allege that IDT had the ability to 
influence CDI's decisions with respect to the master distribution agreements, including the Agreement at issue here. [Id. at ¶¶ 
53-57] "
644,34," Ordinarily, the Court would not make such a sua sponte analysis. But the Court cannot fault Mr. Dieter for not briefing the 
merits of a claim that Plaintiffs' counsel apparently conceded was not being pursued against Mr. Dieter. As a result, and because 
Plaintiffs will have the opportunity to object to this Recommendation and present their arguments about the merits of this claim to 
Judge Moore, the Court will sua sponte address whether Plaintiffs have plausibly pled a breach of contract claim against Mr. 
Dieter. "
645,35, CDI does not separately challenge the breach of contract claim.
645,36, Plaintiffs did not bother to reply to this argument. [#100]
645,37," In 2019 the Colorado Supreme Court revisited the economic loss rule and the Town of Alma case in Bermel v. Blueradios, 
Inc., 440 P.3d 1150, 2019 CO 31 (Colo. 2019). The Bermel court noted that ""[o]ur previous cases have applied the economic 
loss rule to bar only certain common law negligence claims."" Id. at 1153; see also id. at 1153 (""we have applied the [economic 
loss] rule only to common law tort claims for negligence and negligent misrepresentation""); id. at 1155 (""Notably, however, since 
adopting the economic loss rule, we have applied it only to bar common law tort claims of negligence or negligent 
misrepresentation.""). The court went on to state in a footnote that ""the economic loss rule generally should not be available to 
shield intentional tortfeasors from liability for misconduct that happens to also breach a contractual obligation."" Id. at 1154 n.6. 
Although these statements are dicta, courts in this district have considered them alongside Town of Alma in determining whether 
intentional tort claims fall under the economic loss rule. See Western State Bank v. Cosey, L.L.C., No. 19-cv-01155-JLK, 2019 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 190874, 2019 WL 5694271, at *4 (D. Colo. Nov. 4, 2019) (""Western State's fraud claim alleges an intentional 
tort. So, under Bermel, the economic loss rule would not bar Western State's fraud claim.""); McWhinney Holding Co., LLLP v. 
Poag, No. 17-cv-02853-RBJ, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 232438, 2019 WL 9467529, at *2 (D. Colo. Dec. 6, 2019) (""The Bermel 
footnote [Footnote No. 6] clarifies that intentional torts depend on duties independent of contract and therefore are not barred by 
the economic loss rule. . . . The plain language clearly indicates the [Colorado Supreme Court] does not believe intentional torts 
should be covered by the economic loss rule.""); In re Bloom, 622 B.R. 366, 428 (Bankr. D. Colo. 2020) (finding that in light of 
Bermel, the ""intentional tort claims . . . are simply 'outside the scope' of the economic loss rule.""). However, even considering the 
Bermel dicta, this Court nonetheless concludes that the economic loss rule bars Plaintiffs' tortious interference claims against 
CDI. Although this claim is an intentional tort, Plaintiff does not identify actions taken by CDI that would be wrongful or improper 
but for the existence of the contract. Compare Bermel, 440 P.3d at 1151, 1153 (tortfeasor knowingly forwarded thousands of 
company emails containing proprietary information to his personal email account without authorization, and was found at trial to 
have committed civil theft). Indeed, as noted in Section III.A.2 supra, competitive actions to obtain retailers are not on their own 
improper—except that here they allegedly violate the parties' contractual obligations. Moreover, to the degree that Plaintiffs "
646,," allege that CDI engaged in fraudulent misrepresentations—which could raise a duty separate from the contractual obligations, 
see Western State Bank, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 190874, 2019 WL 5694271, at *4—Plaintiffs have failed to sufficiently plead 
their fraud claim under Federal Rule 9(b). Section III.A.2., supra."
646,38," To the extent the breach of fiduciary duty claim is alleged against Mr. Dieter, it fails for the same reasons. "
647,39," At oral argument, Plaintiffs' counsel conceded that Claim Eight was not brought against Mr. Dieter in his individual capacity. To 
the extent that it was, this Court finds that Plaintiffs have not pled facts sufficient to show that Mr. Dieter in his individual 
capacity—and not as the acting agent for CDI—engaged in a conspiracy with IDT. And as an agent for CDI, Mr. Dieter and CDI 
cannot conspire with each other. Lockwood Grader Corp. v. Bockhaus, 129 Colo. 339, 270 P.2d 193, 196 (Colo. 1954) (person 
acting on behalf of corporation cannot conspire with himself individually); Pittman v. Larson Distrib. Co., 724 P.2d 1379, 1390 
(Colo. App. 1986) (""A corporation and its employees do not constitute the 'two or more persons' required for a civil conspiracy . . 
. at least if the employees are acting on behalf of the corporation and not as individuals for their individual advantage.""). 
Accordingly, this Court RECOMMENDS that Claim Eight be DISMISSED as to Mr. Dieter."
647,40," In making this argument, CDI and Mr. Dieter rely upon the assertion that ""[n]o party at any point has challenged the 
enforceability of the [Agreement]."" [#89 at 8] Though not explicitly cited in their response, to determine whether any party has 
questioned the enforceability of the Agreement, the Court would need to look to the answers filed by CDI, IDT, and Mr. Dieter—
without referencing these answers, the Court would not know whether any party has challenged the enforceability of the 
Agreement. But CDI and Mr. Dieter have filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), not a motion for judgment on the 
pleadings pursuant to Rule 12(c). [See generally #89] And while it may be possible for the Court to convert the motion into a 
Rule 12(c) Motion, see Muller v. Vilsack, No. CV 13-0431 MCA/KK, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 194088, 2015 WL 13665433, at *4

Kan. Nov. 23, 2010), the Court declines to do so in the absence of a request from CDI and Mr. Dieter. "
649,41," In its response, CDI states that Plaintiffs failed to confer with CDI prior to filing Plaintiffs' Motion to Dismiss, in contravention of 
Judge Moore's practice standards. [#105 at 1-2] In response, Plaintiffs' state that ""Plaintiffs long warned [Mr.] Dieter and CDI that 
the[ir] counterclaims were suspect and injected in this proceeding to be tough."" [#107 at 3 n. 1] It thus appears that Plaintiffs did 
not confer about the specific alleged deficiencies in the counterclaims or whether those deficiencies could be cured, and 
therefore did indeed violate Judge Moore's practice standards. Indeed, in response to Plaintiffs' Motion to Dismiss, CDI has 
agreed that it did not plead a plausible tortious interference cause of action and has withdrawn that counterclaim. [#105 at 5] 
Plaintiffs are cautioned that future failures to confer may result in sanctions."
649,42, Plaintiffs' Motion to Dismiss does not bring a Rule 12(b)(6) challenge to CDI's breach of contract claim. [See generally #98]
649,43," Plaintiffs' Motion to Dismiss fails to indicate whether Plaintiffs are making a facial attack to CDI's standing or whether they are 
asking the Court to go beyond the allegations contained in the Counterclaim and consider evidence challenging the factual basis 
upon which subject matter jurisdiction rests. At oral argument, counsel for Plaintiffs indicated that Plaintiffs were making a facial 
attack on the Court's subject matter jurisdiction. "
650,44," In their Motion to Dismiss, Plaintiffs state that they ""incorporate[] the factual background in [their] First Amended Complaint. 
[#98 at 3] Plaintiffs fail to offer any support for the notion that this Court can consider facts alleged in the First Amended 
Complaint when considering a Rule 12(b)(1) or Rule 12(b)(6) challenge to CDI's counterclaims."

Had Plaintiffs conferred, Mr. Dieter and CDI could have simply withdrawn their Sixth Affirmative Defense. "

right to appeal from a judgment of the district court based on the proposed findings of fact, legal conclusions, and

(ECF No. 30, ¶¶ 15, 16; ECF No. 35, ¶¶ 15, 16)."
658,2," Tithonus Tyrone is now owned by a third-party. (ECF No. 33, ¶¶ 37, 38, 41; ECF No. 39, ¶¶ 37, 38, 41). "
659,3," At time of its claim, Tithonus Partners and Tithonus Tyrone had no common ownership. (ECF No. 33, ¶ 45; ECF No. 39, ¶ 45). 
Furthermore, Tithonus Tyrone is not a party to the Port Pizza litigation, and Tithonus Partners has not demanded that Tithonus 
Tyrone defend and indemnify Tithonus Partners in the litigation. (ECF No. 33, ¶ 47; ECF No. 39, ¶¶ 47, 48)."
659,4, Tithonus Partners was actually a 99.9% owner of Tithonus Tyrone at the time of the grant. 
662,5," See, e.g., Viera, 642 F.3d at 418-19 (applying a canon of statutory interpretation to interpret language in an insurance 
contract); J.C. Penney Life Ins. Co. v. Pilosi, 393 F.3d 356, 365-66 (3d Cir. 2004) (same). "
664,6," The Court reviewed dictionaries that were contemporaneous with the execution of the contract in 2012. See Madison Constr. 
Co., 735 A.2d at 108 (""Words of common usage in an insurance policy are to be construed in their natural, plain, and ordinary 
sense, and we may inform our understanding of these terms by considering their dictionary definitions.""). "
665,7," Tithonus Partners offers a final counterpoint, asserting that ""Chicago Title cannot reasonably seek to enforce a 100% 'wholly 
owned' exclusion"" because it is ""legal[ly] and factual[ly] impossib[le]"" for any entity to own 100% of Tithonus Tyrone, a 
Pennsylvania limited partnership. (ECF No. 29, p. 18). Tithonus Partners cites Daburlos v. Commercial Insurance Co. of 
Newark, New Jersey, 381 F. Supp. 393, 400 (E.D. Pa. 1974), for the proposition that ""conditions which are impossible of 
performance are ineffectual and void."" That case concerned a policy condition that made it ""impossible for the insureds, within 
the literal terms of [the contract], to modify their insurance [coverage],"" thereby depriving them of an express ""contractual right 
purchased by the payment of the premium."" Id. at 402. The court thus ""disregarded"" the impossible condition and held that the 
insureds' beneficiary, having satisfied the other conditions of coverage, had a right to collect under the policy. Id. at 397, 401. 
The purportedly impossible condition in this case, however, is of a different sort. The ""wholly owned"" subclause—part of a 
generic definition section—does not have any effect whatsoever on the coverage rights of the named Insured (Tithonus Tyrone). 
Nor does it operate as the sole method for third parties (like Tithonus Partners) to seek coverage rights as successors to the 
named Insured. Thus, while affording ""wholly owned"" its plain meaning may render it inapplicable in most, if not all cases, it 
would not cause an outright deprivation of rights at the heart of the contract, as occurred in Daburlos. Accordingly, the Court will 
not ""disregard[]"" the ""wholly owned"" requirement. Id at 401. And the Court cannot ""rewrit[e]"" the contract or interpret it to require 
something less than whole ownership, which would not be a ""reasonable interpretation"" of unambiguous policy language. Id."
665,8," Because, as a threshold matter, Tithonus Partners is not entitled to coverage as an ""Insured"" under Section 1 of the Policy, the 
Court need not address the parties' arguments under Section 2. "
679,1," Plaintiffs allege that ""[s]ubject to information learned in discovery, the Class Printers comprise HP Color LaserJet printers and 
all-in-one devices, in the following non-exhaustive list of products and product series: HP Color LaserJet Pro M254, HP Color 
LaserJet Pro MFP M280, HP Color LaserJet Pro MFP M281, and all other models affected by HP malware transmissions in the 
way described herein ('Class Printers')."" Dkt. 42 ¶ 33. "
692,1," In its operative pleading, M&N Law also names ""Wyndham Destinations, Inc."" as a counter-defendant. (Doc. 342 at 11). None 
of the Plaintiffs in this action bear that name, however, nor does the record contain a return of service for such an entity. In 
addition, M&N Law's instant submission does not contain any references to a ""Wyndham Destinations, Inc."" Accordingly, I 
assume for purposes of this report and recommendation that M&N Law does not seek a preliminary injunction against Wyndham 
Destinations, Inc."
692,2," The background set forth herein is derived largely from the Court's prior Orders in this action, see, e.g., (Docs. 144, 275, 336), 
the parties' respective pleadings and other submissions, see, e.g., (Docs. 1, 342, 353, 355, 360), and decisions rendered by 
other courts in various related actions. "
694,3," In addition to these legal proceedings, M&N Law commenced a state court action in Missouri in July 2019 against another 
ostensible timeshare developer, Bluegreen Vacations Unlimited, Inc. (Bluegreen Vacations). (Doc. 353-8). According to M&N 
Law, the court in that case certified a class of over 17,000 Bluegreen Vacations owners ""based upon [M&N Law's] allegations 
that Bluegreen [Vacations] committed the illegal act of the unauthorized practice of law in connection with timeshare sales."" Id.; 
Bluegreen Vacations Hldg. Corp., Annual Report (Form 10-K) (Mar. 1, 2021). More recently, Bluegreen Vacations sued M&N 
Law and other parties in the Southern District of Florida, alleging the same claims as Wyndham asserts here. See Bluegreen 
Vacations Unlimited, Inc. v. Montgomery Law Firm, LLC, Case No. 1:19-cv-24704-JEM (S.D. Fla.); (Doc. 353-8). "
695,4," For ease of reference, M&N Law's antitrust counterclaim under the Clayton and Sherman Acts is generally described herein as 
M&N Law's Sherman Act counterclaim. "
696,5," M&N Law did agree at the hearing, however, to withdraw the portion of its proposed preliminary injunction, which requested 
that Wyndham's alleged co-conspirators be barred from suing M&N Law in any state court across the United States. (Doc. 383 
at 21-22)."
696,6," Wyndham recently filed a notice of supplemental authority advising the Court of the Southern District of Florida's ruling in the 
Bluegreen Vacations action. (Doc. 396). M&N Law did not do the same, however, even though it cited the Bluegreen Vacations 
litigation in its preliminary injunction motion. See (Doc. 353 at 2). "
699,7," It should be noted that the Southern District of Florida similarly rejected M&N Law's challenges to Wyndham's identical tortious 
interference, civil conspiracy, and Lanham Act causes of action in the Bluegreen Vacations case. See Bluegreen Vacations, 
Case No. 1:19-cv-24704-JEM, (Doc. 69) (S.D. Fla. Nov. 20, 2020). "
701,8," There is Eleventh Circuit case authority that where a plaintiff seeks only injunctive relief under section 16 of the Clayton Act, the 
showing required to establish the second element of the standing analysis is generally ""less demanding"" than under section 4 of 
the Clayton Act. Todorov, 921 F.2d at 1452. The Court need not resolve what showing this decisional law might require of M&N 
Law here because, as explained below, M&N Law has not satisfied the first prong of the antitrust standing inquiry or established 
that it will likely prevail on the principal elements of its Sherman Act counterclaim. "
702,9," Because M&N Law does not satisfy the antirust injury element and—as discussed below—also does not meet its burden on the 
merits of its Sherman Act counterclaim, the Court need not resolve whether it can establish the second element of the antitrust 
standing inquiry. See Levine, 72 F.3d at 1545. I note only that an evaluation of the second element can be much more involved 
than an assessment of the first element and would necessitate a far more extended discussion, particularly given M&N Law's 
apparently evolving theories behind its Sherman Act counterclaim. See Palmyra Park, 604 F.3d at 1299 (citation omitted). "
703,10," I also note that M&N Law does not attempt to refute Wyndham's rejoinder that it and Bluegreen Vacations retained the same 
lawyers because of the quality of the attorneys' work and the cost-savings involved. (Doc. 355 at 10 n.4). Wyndham's other 
rejoinder—that the tortious conduct at issue in both lawsuits is the same—appears well-taken and likewise stands unrebutted. Id. "
708,11," Local Rules 6.01 and 6.02 also obligate a party to include with its motion ""a precise and verified explanation of the amount and 
form of the required security."" M.D. Fla. R. 6.01(a), 6.02(a). M&N Law failed to adhere to this requirement and acknowledged at 
the hearing that such a failure ""could be grounds alone to deny [its] motion."" (Doc. 383 at 29). It orally moved, however, for the 
Court to excuse its noncompliance with these provisions. Id. The Court need not address this request given the other infirmities 
with M&N Law's preliminary injunction motion."
708,12," In light of the deficiencies in M&N Law's motion, the Court likewise need not resolve M&N Law's bid to bind the full panoply of 
parties sanctioned by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65. I note only that such a request appears to be wanting given M&N 
Law's unsupported allegations about the other persons involved in Wyndham's alleged conspiracy, and the Eleventh Circuit's 
directive that an injunction be ""'narrowly tailored to fit specific legal violations [so as to] not impose unnecessary burdens on 
lawful activity.'"" Cumulus Media, 304 F.3d at 1178 (citation omitted)."
708,13, Unpublished opinions are not considered binding precedent but may be cited as persuasive authority. 11th Cir. R. 36-2. 
710,1," HCSC states it was erroneously sued as Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois. Mot. at 6. For the purposes of this Order, the Court 
refers to HCSC rather than BCBS when referring to the allegations in the FAC. "
711,2," Plaintiffs did not allege the date of the first verification call for Patient A, or for several of the verification calls relating to Patients 
B and C."
711,3," Plaintiffs alleged the names of the representatives of HCSC with whom they spoke on each call to verify benefits and pre-
authorization requirements. FAC ¶¶ 15, 16, 24, 25, 33, 39, 40, 53, 54. "
712,4, Plaintiffs do not allege they inquired about pre-authorization requirements for the February 2019 procedure. 
715,5," Defendant also asserts Plaintiffs' UCL claim should be dismissed because it is based on underlying claims that are not 
actionable. Mot. at 16. This argument is inapplicable because Plaintiffs did not base their UCL claim on the unlawful prong. "
725,1," Defendants are Bank of America Corporation, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., and BofA Securities, Inc. 
(collectively, ""Bank of America""); Barclays Capital Inc. (""Barclays""); Citigroup Inc., and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (collectively, 
""Citigroup""); Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LCC (""Credit Suisse""); Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. (""Deutsche Bank""); The

Barney LLC (collectively, ""Morgan Stanley""); NatWest Markets Securities Inc. (""NatWest"" or ""RBS""); and Wells Fargo & Co., 
Wells Fargo Securities LLC, and Wells Fargo Clearing Services, LLC (collectively, ""Wells Fargo""). "
735,2, Or drawn them all down collectively. 
739,3," Although Plaintiffs seem to allege that this was part of a course of parallel conduct along with the earlier-referenced InterVest 
""penalty"" by Salomon, two isolated actions that are somewhat similar but separated by about two decades do not constitute 
parallel conduct. See TSA, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 62529, 2021 WL 1226670, at *19 (holding with regard to events that ""took 
place ten years or more before most of Plaintiffs' remaining allegations"" that ""Plaintiffs have not pled sufficient intervening facts 
to tie together the alleged 2003 conduct with conduct that took place in 2013 or later""). "
752,4," Moreover, Plaintiffs have already amended their complaint once in response to Defendants' first motion to dismiss, at Dkt. No. 
117, which raised virtually identical arguments to those considered here. "
757,1," NPI accuses GPS of violating Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15, which permits a party to amend its pleading ""once as a 
matter of course"" within 21 days after (i) serving it, (ii) service of a responsive pleading, or (iii) service of a motion under Rule 
12(b), (e), or (f), whichever is earlier. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(1). NPI contends that GPS used its ""once as a matter of course"" 
opportunity when it filed its Second Amended Answer and Amended Counterclaims, docket no. 35, on December 8, 2020. Citing 
Ramirez v. County of San Bernardino, 806 F.3d 1002 (9th Cir. 2015), GPS counters that all prior amendments of its responsive 
pleading were filed with NPI's consent, as ""other amendments"" pursuant to Rule 15(a)(2), and that it invoked its ""once as a 
matter of course"" right only in filing its Third Amended Answer and Amended Counterclaims, docket no. 38. NPI does not dispute 
that GPS's latest pleading was filed within 21 days after NPI filed its original motion to dismiss, docket no. 36, which was later 
voluntarily withdrawn, see Notice (docket no. 44), and NPI has not disagreed with GPS's characterization of its earlier 
amendments as having been filed upon agreement of the parties, see Reply (docket no. 69); see also Stip. Mot. (docket no. 32). 
The Court finds no procedural deficiency in GPS's operative pleading, but to the extent that GPS had already exercised its ""once 
as a matter of course"" option, the Court hereby GRANTS leave to amend nunc pro tunc and considers GPS's Third Amended 
Answer and Amended Counterclaims properly filed. "
764,2," The directive requiring the Court to convert a Rule 12(b)(6) or 12(c) motion into one for summary judgment if matters outside 
the pleadings are presented and not excluded does not apply to Rule 12(f) motions to strike. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(d). "
784,1," The Court uses the pagination generated by the electronic CM/ECF database, which appears in the headers of all court filings. "
786,2," Plaintiffs think the quick-look standard, an approach that lies ""'somewhere on the continuum between the per se rule and the 
rule of reason'"" approach, should apply here. (Reply 9 n.5 (quoting In re Blue Cross Blue Shield Antitrust Litig., 26 F. Supp. 3d 
1172, 1185 (N.D. Ala. 2014))). ""[The quick look approach] applies where an observer with even a rudimentary understanding of 
economics could conclude that the arrangements in question would have an anticompetitive effect on customers and markets."" 
Procaps S.A. v. Patheon, Inc., 845 F.3d 1072, 1084 n.3 (11th Cir. 2016) (alteration added; quotation marks and citation omitted). "
788,3," These emails relate to a discovery dispute. Defendants sought discovery related to fish other than salmon, which Plaintiffs 
opposed as not relevant. (See Opp'n 6). Defendants contend this opposition was evidence that Plaintiffs intended to only pursue 
a per se claim, because, according to Defendants, information about other fish is clearly relevant to a rule of reason analysis. 
(See id.). Plaintiffs disagree, stating the market is simply farm-raised Atlantic salmon, and discovery about other fish is irrelevant. 
(See Reply 10). Without commenting on the merits of either position, the Court does not believe that Plaintiffs' discovery position 
is inconsistent with a rule of reason theory; even now, when pursuing a rule of reason theory, they still contend that non-salmon 
fish discovery is irrelevant. (See id.). "

795,4," Defendants object on foundation grounds, Defs.' Opp'n (ECF No. 1146, at 15 n.7), to the admissibility of Plaintiffs' exhibit, 
PX004 (ECF No. 1086-4), through which Patrick T. Davish confirmed the WAC price increases, Davish Dep. 108:10-109:5 (ECF 
No. 1086-2, at 6-7). However, because Defendants do not dispute the price increases themselves, the court accepts Plaintiffs' 
evidence that the WAC price increased fourteen times."
795,5," Exhibits designated MPX"" are the exhibits to the Declaration of Thomas M. Sobol in Support of Purchasers' Oppositions to 
Merck and Glenmark Defendants' Motions for Summary Judgment and to Exclude the Opinions and Testimony of Purchasers' 
Experts. (ECF No. 1086). Sealed exhibits are filed at ECF Nos. 1090 and 1091. "
796,6," Defendants contend that Merck ""increase[d] discounts and rebates (lowering net price) regularly prior to the loss of exclusivity . 
. . ."" Defs.' Opp'n (ECF No. 1146, at 22) (emphasis in original). Plaintiffs contend ""[t]he scattered documents cited . . . do not 
establish that market-wide discounting for Zetia took place before generic Zetia entry in December 2016."" Pls.' Reply (ECF No. 
1206, at 27 n.75). Merck planned for LOE contracting at least a year in advance of generic ezetimibe launch. See Addanki Rpt. ¶ 
33 (ECF No. 1091-11, at 23). The court agrees that the evidence in the summary judgment record on this motion does not 
establish that Merck engaged in the same level of rebating and discounting before generic launch as it did upon launch. To the 
extent reasonable jurors might find more discounting before generic entry, it could not be sufficient to create a dispute of material 
fact on the relevant market issue, given the consistent and undisputed evidence of WAC price increases."
796,7," Plaintiffs repeatedly claim that Merck ""knew"" that Zetia was not in direct competition with other cholesterol-lowering drugs, see, 
e.g., Pls.' Mem. (ECF No. 1090, at 16-17), but Plaintiffs' record citations do not establish that Merck universally believed no other 
cholesterol drugs presented a financial threat to Zetia. In fact, Merck documents classify some products as potential risks. See, 
e.g., PX012 (ECF No. 1090-8, at 21) (noting that Crestor's LOE was a ""risk""). "
797,8," Jena extends his critiques to Dr. Keith Leffler (""Leffler""). See Defs.' Opp'n (ECF No. 1146, at 60); Jena Rpt. ¶¶ 111-63 (ECF 
No. 1090-1, at 60-83). Leffler also assessed ""the competitive impact of the reverse payment settlement"" and ""whether a delay of 
generic Zetia allowed Merck to maintain market power in the sale of Zetia."" Leffler Rpt. ¶ 7 (ECF No. 1091-13, at 5). Defendants 
have moved to exclude Leffler. Defs.' Joint Mot. to Exclude Test. & Ops. of Pls.' Experts Drs. Thomas McGuire and Keith Leffler 
(ECF No. 1048). That motion remains before the court, but it is not necessary to resolve it here. Plaintiffs rely almost exclusively 
upon Starr in their motion for partial summary judgment. See generally Pls.' Mem. (ECF No. 1090, at 30-32). "
798,9," Plaintiffs express concern that Jena's own-price elasticity analysis is based entirely on a 2015 emailed spreadsheet. See Pls.' 
Mem. to Exclude (ECF No. 1068, at 15-16). Jena confirmed that his ""empirical estimate of own-price elasticity . . . comes from 
this spreadsheet."" Jena Dep. 75:20-21 (ECF No. 1091-6, at 19). However, Defendants clarify that the scope of Jena's analysis is 
broader than just the spreadsheet. Defs.' Opp'n (ECF No. 1146, at 59). For the purposes of this motion, the court accepts Jena's 
evidence of own-price elasticity. "
799,10," The Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs filed the primary motion, (ECF No. 1066), which the End-Payor Plaintiffs then incorporated,

799,11," The Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs filed the primary motion, (ECF No. 1077), which the End-Payor Plaintiffs then incorporated, 
(ECF No. 1080)."
799,12," Plaintiffs and Defendants filed supporting memoranda as both public (redacted) and under seal. Plaintiffs' Memorandum in 
Support is filed as public at ECF No. 1078 and sealed at ECF No. 1090. Defendants' Opposition is filed as public at ECF No. 
1140 and sealed at ECF No. 1146. Plaintiffs' Reply is filed as public at ECF No. 1194 and sealed at ECF No. 1206. This Report and Recommendation relies upon the parties' sealed memoranda. To the extent that the court utilizes facts in 
recommending disposition that were originally sealed, the court has determined that the interests of the public outweigh the 
parties' interests in confidentiality, and the information relied upon is hereby unsealed. "
804,13," This observation was made in the context of a discovery dispute, in which the judge found that any discovery related to other 
drugs beyond the patented one and its generic equivalent was ""irrelevant."" Aggrenox, 199 F. Supp. 3d at 663, 669. Defendants 
make much of that posture. See, e.g., Tr. 90:25-91:2 (ECF No. 1300, at 90-91) (arguing that the judge ""never looked at any 
evidence""). However, despite the difference between that posture and the one here, I find Aggrenox's legal analysis is sound, 
persuasive, and entirely consistent with the extensive evidence presented in this motion. "
807,14," Defendants argue that the AIDS model also shows several statins as complements, but this comes from Jena's recalculations. 
See Defs.' Opp'n (ECF No. 1146, at 53). "
809,15," Defendants provide some evidence of formulary placement for several specific medications (Crestor, simvastatin, and 
atorvastatin), claiming that it shows ""significant cross-price elasticity between Zetia and these competitive cholesterol-lowering 
drugs."" Defs.' Opp'n (ECF No. 1146, at 46-47). However, Defendants do not attempt to define the market as including only Zetia 
and these named drugs. In fact, Defendants' loose definition would seem to encompass drug and non-drug therapies. "
811,16," For example, even with partial summary judgment in their favor, Plaintiffs still bear the burden of proving the existence of a 
reverse payment, whether any procompetitive benefits outweigh harms, and whether the unlawful conduct caused Plaintiffs 
injury. See Actavis, 570 U.S. at 147-56. "

820,4," Each side quotes from various statements issued by FTC Commissioners in connection with this vote. None is dispositive and 
it is black letter law that the FTC's decision to settle and not to file a complaint seeking to block the merger does not establish 
that the merger was lawful under the Sherman and Clayton Acts. See 15 U.S.C. § 45(e) (""No order of the Commission or 
judgement of court to enforce the same shall in anywise relieve or absolve any person, partnership, or corporation from any 
liability under the Antitrust Acts.""). "
823,5," Celgene does not explain how its decision to send Nimbus a ""letter ... reserving [its]rights with respect to [the notice of exercise] 
deadline"" rather than to deliver a notice of exercise on October 11, 2021 is consistent with the choice to treat the contract as 
valid. See Tr. 3. But the Court need not resolve that issue now."
823,6," Neither party contends that the serious questions prong applies here. See Actavis PLC, 787 F.3d at 650."
823,7," A higher standard also applies where the preliminary injunction would provide substantially all the relief the movant ultimately 
seeks and that relief cannot be undone if the non-movant prevails at trial. See Tom Doherty Assocs., Inc. v. Saban Ent., Inc., 60 
F.3d 27, 34 (2d Cir. 1995). Neither party argues that the instant motion implicates this issue."
823,8," See Tom Doherty Assocs., Inc., 60 F.3d at 34 (""Confusion in breach of contract cases as to whether an injunction is mandatory 
or prohibitory may stem from the meaning of 'status quo.' HN3[
] A plaintiff's view of the status quo is the situation that would 
prevail if its version of the contract were performed. A defendant's view of the status quo is its continued failure to perform as the 
plaintiff desires. To a breach of contract defendant, any injunction requiring performance may seem mandatory.""). "
824,9," Specifically, Celgene argues that the relevant obligation arises from the parties' covenant to ""use commercially reasonable 
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all reasonable actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the 
other Party in doing, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated 
hereby."" Warrant § 6.8(d); See Mot. 13-14. "
827,10," Nimbus points out that it is separately ""challenging the enforceability of the Warrant under various claims under the Sherman 
Act and the Clayton Act,"" and that these claims have four-year statutes of limitations. Opp. 22-23 (citing 15 U.S.C. § 15b). But 
whether claims arising under the antitrust laws themselves are timely is a distinct issue from whether Nimbus may still assert a 
defense to a counterclaim for specific performance (or a claim for breach of contract) based on an alleged violation of the 
antitrust laws. "
828,11," To the contrary, the record reflects that to address tensions arising from the Merger, Celgene and BMS established an 
information screening protocol in February 2020, to which Nimbus consented without objections. See ECF 18-6. "
829,12," Celgene would also need to establish that it substantially performed under the Warrant. See NML Cap., Ltd. v. Republic of 
Argentina, 699 F.3d 246, 261 n. 12 (2d Cir. 2012) (""To be eligible for specific performance of a contractual provision, a party also 
needs to show that (1) a valid contract exists between the parties, (2) the plaintiff has substantially performed its part of the 
contract, and (3) plaintiff and defendant are each able to continue performing their parts of the agreement.""). The only relevant 
aspect of Celgene's performance that Nimbus disputes is whether Celgene satisfied its covenants or breached them by 
consummating the Merger. Since the Court concluded that Celgene and BMS are likely to succeed in establishing that Celgene 
did not materially breach its covenants, the Court accordingly holds that it they also will likely prove that Celgene adequately 
performed its contractual duties under the Warrant. "
831,13," Nor is so-called ""quick look"" analysis appropriate, since the assignment provision is not an ""inherently suspect"" device where 
""the great likelihood of anticompetitive effects can be easily ascertained."" 1-800 Contacts, 1 F.4th at 115. "
846,1," The parties have also filed 21 motions to seal. Dkt. Nos. 462, 465, 468, 471, 473, 475, 479, 506, 515, 518, 522, 524, 528, 531, 
536, 550, 551, 554, 560, 568, 599. I will issue a separate order addressing these motions. Suffice it to say, the parties have 
sought to seal a great deal of information that does not meet the compelling interest standard that applies to dispositive motions. 
See Ctr. for Auto Safety v. Chrysler Grp., LLC, 809 F.3d 1092, 1096-99 (9th Cir. 2016), cert. denied sub nom. FCA U.S. LLC v. 
Ctr. for Auto Safety, 137 S. Ct. 38, 196 L. Ed. 2d 26 (2016). While I will address all of the sealing requests in a separate order, 
what is not sealed in this Order does not meet the applicable standard. Further, with respect to those portions of this Order that 
are sealed, the parties should not assume that I have concluded that they have provided a sufficient basis to seal the 
information. These redactions are preliminary and should not be taken as an indication about the merits of sealing. "
848,2," This case is related to Teradata v. SAP, No. 20-CV-06127-WHO."
848,3," The parties dispute whether Teradata asserted a new tying theory during the summary judgment briefing, i.e., that SAP 
unlawfully tied S/4HANA to HANA's analytical capabilities through licensing. See infra Part I.B.3. "
858,4," During the hearing, Teradata's counsel asserted for the first time that Asker's methodology was proper because market 
definition can be determined based on practical indicia. Hearing Tr. at 31. Its counsel expressly identified one factor, industry or 
public recognition of the market, as a separate economic entity. Id. But the case on which Teradata relies holds that, ""[t]he 
existence of three or four of these indicia has been held 'sufficient to delineate a submarket,'"" not one. In re Live Concert 
Antitrust Litig., 863 F. Supp. 2d at 989. As explained in the subsequent sections, there is no evidence of three or four of these 
practical indicia. See Brown Shoe, 370 U.S. at 325 (practical indicia are ""industry or public recognition of the submarket as a 
separate economic entity, the product's peculiar characteristics and uses, unique production facilities, distinct customers, distinct 
prices, sensitivity to price changes, and specialized vendors.""). "
861,5," In its opposition to SAP's motion for summary judgment, Teradata asserts that SAP's argument—""that a product market must 
include economic substitutes, i.e., products that would see increased demand in response to a price increase in another 
product""—contravenes established economic principles. Dkt. No. 542 at 30. It argues that the Guidelines ""make clear that even 
if a significant number of customers (even two thirds) would switch to other suppliers' products in response to a price increase, 
that does not require their inclusion in a properly defined relevant market."" Id. (citing Dkt. No. 543-64 (""Guidelines"") § 4.1). But 
the Guidelines do not say this. Instead, Section 4.1 of the Guidelines make clear that although a product market need not 
include every competitor, it must ""contain enough substitute products"" to satisfy the SSNIP test. Guidelines § 4.1; see Dkt. No. 
552 at 20."
861,6," ""Aggregate diversion analysis finds the threshold where a hypothetical monopolist imposing a [SSNIP] would lose enough sales 
('actual loss') compared the ""critical loss"" such that the SSNIP would be unprofitable for the hypothetical monopolist. When the 
estimated actual loss due to a SSNIP is smaller than the critical loss, the candidate market is considered a relevant antitrust 
market."" Asker Rep. ¶ 71. "
862,7," In fact, as opposed to the ""hundreds of thousands"" of entries in the CRM data used by the expert in Sysco, Asker relied on 
fewer than 7,700 entries in SAP's CRM data because almost 85% of the data lacked any competitor information. Asker Rep. at 
46, Exhibit 14; see Sysco, 113 F. Supp. 3d at 35."
862,8," Teradata contends that SAP's expert, Murphy confirmed the proprietary of Asker's methodology. Asker Opp. at 3 n.9; Hearing 
Tr. at 29. But Asker relied on CRM data, which addresses the ""relative frequency with which those firms compete for Core ERP 
sales opportunities,"" whereas Murphy confirmed the methodology of looking at ""win/loss"" data to indicate substitutability. Asker 
Opp. at 3; see Dkt. No. 530-36 (""Murphy Depo."") at 44-45. SAP also points out that Murphy does not use the CRM data to define 
any antitrust markets. Hearing Tr. at 56. "
863,9," SAP points out that in his initial report, Asker also analyzes ""per-unit prices"" for large customers, based on the ""'size' of 
installation (number of users),"" and concludes that they vary. See Asker Rep. ¶ 76; id., Ex. 7. Stiroh responded that the per user 
prices paid by small and mid-sized customers also vary, but tend to be higher than those paid by large customers, and therefore 
there is no evidence of price discrimination against large customers. Stiroh Rep. ¶¶ 51-57. In his reply report, Asker criticizes Dr. 
Stiroh for using ""per-user"" prices and claims that the appropriate measure is ""total spend."" Asker Reb. Rep. ¶ 77. According to 
SAP, ""neither Dr. Asker nor Teradata explain this flip-flop."" Asker Reply at 5. "
864,10," Further, Teradata asserts that SAP's contention that HANA does not compete with Teradata contradicts its prior statements. 
Hearing Tr. at 38-39; see, e.g., Dkt. No. 543-54 at 367 (a technical textbook explaining to customers how to use HANA as an 
EDW). SAP responds that the relevant question is not whether SAP tried to sell HANA as an EDW but whether customers 
purchase and use HANA for this purpose. It asserts that Asker's ""false assumption that, because SAP tried to market SAP as an 
EDW, customers necessarily use it as an EDW, runs throughout Asker's EDW-related opinions and renders them unreliable."" 
Reply at 8."
864,11," Teradata cites two internal SAP documents but neither suggests Dr. Asker's proposed market is properly limited to just SAP 
and one competitor. Asker Reply at 20; see, e.g., Dkt. 539-5 at 688-90 (concerns cloud competition and shows that while SAP 
considers Oracle its ""main"" competitor, it also loses business to Microsoft and Workday); Dkt. 543-44 at 7 (includes additional 
competitors like Infor, Sage, and Microsoft on the slide). "
865,12, See infra Part I.B.4.a for discussion on the application of either the rule of reason or per se analysis to this case.
865,13," The reason for this lack of evidence, however, is Teradata's allegation of a new tying theory during the summary judgment 
briefmg. See infra Part I.B.3. "
866,14," Because Teradata's tying claim fails, see infra Part I.B.4, I will not address SAP's motion to exclude Asker's analysis of lost 
profits due to the alleged tying arrangement. "
867,15," Teradata does assert that unlike Mehrotra, Jagadish examined the source code and software. Mehrotra Mot. at 10. SAP 
responds that nowhere in the sections of Jagadish's report, to which Mehrotra responds, does Jagadish refer to S/4HANA 
source code. Mehrotra Opp. at 13-14. Instead, Jagadish discusses the source code only in relation to trade secrets. Compare 
Jagadish Rep. § X.0 I 247-75 (discussing trade secrets) with Jagadish Rep. § X.E ¶¶336-77 (discussing antitrust opinions). "
871,16," Moreover, even if the tied market definition was proper, summary judgment would still be appropriate because Teradata 
cannot show that SAP has caused actual injury to competition in a market for ""EDW products with OLAP capabilities for large 
enterprises."" See supra Part I.B.1.b. "
873,17," In the Claim Construction Order, I rejected Teradata's proposal to construe ""mapping"" as ""associating or assigning."" Claim 
Construction Order at 14-15. Instead I construed ""mapping"" as ""[c]reating and storing, in computer system memory or secondary "
874,," storage for a computer system, an association between data elements in the computer system such that a computer can locate 
a data element using that association."" Id. "
876,18," Teradata asserts that whether I adopt SAP's or its articulation of the abstract idea, the Section 101 analysis does not change 
because its articulation ""is simply a form of organizing information into logical groups."" Reply TMSJ at 7. "
877,19, SAP only addresses claim 4 but Teradata addresses the parallel elements of claims 1 and 4 together. Reply TMSJ at 9. 
879,20," Teradata asserts that SAP's rewriting of claim 4 underscores that the ordered ""combination"" of elements in claim 4 cannot 
survive Alice step two. Reply TMSJ at 9. It argues that SAP (1) combines the first two elements; (2) moves the ""mapping"" 
limitations to follow the filling, processing, and providing analysis limitations; and (3) adds the word ""[particular]"" to make three 
claim elements seem less generic. Id. "
880,21," SAP also contends that Teradata has not shown a lack of genuine dispute that there are no other ways to implement the 
alleged abstract idea. Opp. TMSJ at 15-16. But Teradata does not have to show that SAP has preempted an entire idea for the 
'321 claims to be patent-ineligible. ""While preemption may signal patent ineligible subject matter, the absence of complete 
preemption does not demonstrate patent eligibility."" FairWarning IP, LLC v. Iatric Systems, Inc., 839 F.3d 1089, 1098 (Fed. Cir. 
2016) (citation omitted). "
885,1," Master Case refers to No. 4:14-md-02567-GAF (W.D. Mo.). All docket citations will be to the Master Case unless otherwise 
noted."
885,2," Plaintiffs originally asserted a federal injunctive relief claim and state law claims from 24 different states. The Court dismissed 
Plaintiffs' federal injunctive relief claim, and that dismissal was affirmed on appeal by the Eighth Circuit. (Doc. # 283). 
Subsequently, Defendants moved for judgment on the pleadings on Plaintiffs' remaining state law claims and the Court granted 
the motion in part as to 11 of Plaintiffs' 24 state law claims. (Doc. # 355). Accordingly, Plaintiffs moved for class certification on 
their remaining 13 state law claims. "
886,3," Plaintiffs also sought conditionally to certify a multi-state class of supposed end customers who ""directly"" purchased AmeriGas 
and Blue Rhino spare and exchange tanks during the same alleged class period. (See Doc. # 476 at p. 5). At the time Plaintiffs 
moved for class certification, their motion for leave to amend their complaint to add ""direct purchaser"" claims based on customer 
purchases of tanks from AmeriGas and Blue Rhino vending machines was then pending. (Doc. ## 426, 427). The Court 
subsequently denied Plaintiffs' motion for leave to amend, thereby mooting their alternative request to certify a ""direct purchaser"" 
class. (See Doc. # 491)."
886,4," By way of introduction, the Court generally cites to the expert reports. However, specific cites to expert opinions referenced are 
provided in the ""Analysis"" section of this Order. "
887,5," After moving for class certification, Plaintiffs requested additional discovery from Ferrellgas relating solely to post-2015 
damages. The Court concluded that Plaintiffs' belated discovery request was foreclosed by the Eighth Circuit's prior decision in 
In re Pre-Filled Propane Tank Antitrust Litigation, 893 F.3d 1047 (8th Cir. 2018). (See Doc. # 547, pp. 11-12). "
896,6, [ILLEGIBLE FOOTNOTE]
896,7," Plaintiffs on reply offered the opinion that ""cost-plus"" pricing is ""prevalent"" in the industry, such that ""there is no reason to think 
that any overcharge would not be passed through,"" (Doc. # 540 at 11), but that is nothing more than conjecture, unsupported by 
any actual evidence in the record. It is not something that can be relied upon as common proof of class-wide pass-through. See 
Brooke Grp. Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 509 U.S. 209, 242, 113 S. Ct. 2578, 125 L. Ed. 2d 168 (1993) (expert 
opinion is ""useful as a guide to interpreting market facts, but it is not a substitute for them"")."
896,8," Plaintiffs sought to undo this admitted limitation of Professor Ackerberg's pass-through studies by pointing to how Professor 
Ackerberg also analyzed data beyond 2012 for robustness. But the fact that Professor Ackerberg undertook such a robustness 
analysis and nevertheless concluded, based on his expertise, to limit his opinions and conclusions regarding pass-through on 
data only through 2012 just confirms that his studies cannot serve as proof of any impact beyond 2012. "
902,1," The JES Properties court also held that § 768.79 was pre-empted by federal antitrust law and that the offers of judgment were 
invalid because they were ambiguous and failed to address the plaintiffs' claims for injunctive relief. JES Props., 432 F. Supp. 2d 
at 1293-94. "
912,1," The Defendants are E*Trade Securities LLC; E*Trade Financial Holdings, LLC; Interactive Brokers LLC; Robinhood Markets, 
Inc.; Robinhood Financial LLC; Robinhood Securities, LLC; Citadel Securities LLC; Apex Clearing Corp.; Electronic Transaction 
Clearing, Inc.; and PEAK6 Investments LLC (collectively, ""Defendants""). (See CCAC ¶¶ 51-75)."
912,2," The Plaintiffs are Angel Guzman, Burke Minahan, Christopher Miller, and Terell Sterling (collectively, ""Plaintiffs""). (See CCAC 
¶¶ 23-41)."
912,3," A ""short"" seller borrows a security believing the price of the security will decrease. (See CCAC ¶ 8). If the price of the security 
drops, the short seller buys the security back at a lower price and returns it to the lender. (See id.). Because the difference 
between the sell price and the buy price is the short seller's profit, the short seller loses money if the price of the security 
increases. (See id.)."
912,4," The ""Relevant Securities"" are certain stocks the Retail Investors believed would increase in price: GameStop (GME), AMC 
Entertainment (AMC), Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY), BlackBerry (BB), Express (EXPR), Koss (KOSS), Nokia (NOK), Tootsie Roll 
Industries (TR), and Trivago NV (TRVG). (See CCAC ¶ 6)."
912,5," In the CCAC, Plaintiffs allege there was a fourth group called the Introducing Brokerage Defendants (see CCAC ¶¶ 42-50), but 
they have since voluntarily dismissed those Defendants (see [ECF No. 380] (Stash Financial, Inc.); [ECF No. 396] (Open to the 
Public Investing, Inc.); [ECF No. 397] (Ally Financial Inc.); [ECF No. 398] (Alpaca Securities, LLC); [ECF No. 400] (Dough LLC); 
[ECF No. 401] (Tastyworks, Inc.); [ECF No. 402] (Webull Financial LLC); [ECF No. 404] (SoFi Securities LLC)). The Court refers 
to this group as the ""Introducing Brokerages."" The Introducing Brokerages provide financial trading services through an electronic trading platform. (See CCAC ¶¶ 42-44, 46, 
47, 49, 50). During the relevant period, each Introducing Brokerage restricted and/or limited the ability of investors to purchase 
the Relevant Securities. (See id.). Because the Introducing Brokerages are only introducing brokerages — as opposed to self-clearing brokerages — they contract 
with an independent clearing firm to handle the execution and settlement of securities trade orders from clients or their own 
trading desks, rather than handle the process themselves. (See id. ¶¶ 105, 111). The independent clearing firm receives "
913,," payments and maintains custody of the security. (See id. ¶ 111). At all relevant times, each Introducing Brokerage used a 
Clearing Defendant as its clearing firm. (See id. ¶¶ 42-44, 46, 47, 49, 50)."
913,6," Apex Clearing Holdings LLC and Defendant, PEAK6 Investments LLC, are the parent corporations of Defendants, Apex and 
ETC. (See CCAC ¶¶ 67, 70)."
913,7," The DTCC is a holding company that owns and operates three clearing agencies registered with the U.S. Securities and 
Exchange Commission (""SEC""): the National Securities Clearing Corporation (""NSCC""), the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation 
(""FICC""), and the Depository Trust Company (""DTC""). (See CCAC ¶ 96). The NSCC is the central counterparty that clears cash 
transactions in the U.S. equities markets by netting securities deliveries and payments among NSCC's clearing members and 
guaranteeing the completion of trades, even if one party to the transaction defaults. (See id. ¶ 98). It takes two business days for 
the NSCC to transfer the security to the buyer and the cash to the seller. (See id. ¶ 101). If a clearing member defaults on its 
settlement obligations, the NSCC guarantees the delivery of cash and securities to its non-defaulting members. (See id. ¶ 102). In line with the CCAC and the parties' briefings, the Court refers to the DTCC and NSCC interchangeably."
913,8," Defendant, E*Trade Financial Holdings, LLC (see CCAC ¶ 52), is the parent corporation of Defendant, E*Trade Securities LLC 
(see Mot. 22 n.9; Resp. 47). The Court refers to these two Defendants collectively as ""E*Trade[.]"" Doing so has no impact on the 
Court's analysis. The Court uses the pagination generated by the electronic CM/ECF database, which appears in the headers of all court filings."
913,9," Defendants, Robinhood Markets, Inc.; Robinhood Financial LLC; and Robinhood Securities, LLC, are, collectively, 
""Robinhood[.]"" Robinhood Financial LLC and Robinhood Securities, LLC are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Robinhood Markets, 
Inc. (See CCAC ¶¶ 58, 60). Defendants dispute the inclusion of Robinhood as a self-clearing broker, arguing Robinhood 
Financial LLC is an introducing broker entity separate from Robinhood Securities, LLC, the clearing entity. (See Mot. 13, 14 n.2). 
This distinction, however, has no impact on the Court's analysis."
913,10," Although Plaintiffs refer to ""Market Maker Defendants"" (see, e.g., CCAC ¶ 92), Plaintiffs name only one Market Maker 
Defendant (see id. ¶¶ 64-65). "
915,11," A call option gives the holder the right to buy the asset at a stated fixed price or the ""strike price."" (See CCAC ¶ 166). An ""out 
of the money"" option has a strike price unfavorable in comparison to the market price for the underlying asset. (See id. ¶ 169). "
916,12," Another phenomenon known as a ""Gamma squeeze"" occurred as the prices of the Relevant Securities increased. (See CCAC 
¶¶ 162, 164). Options are priced based on a variety of risk variables, including one called ""Gamma,"" which increases as the 
option nears its expiration date or as the option approaches its strike price (i.e. ""being in the money""). (See id. ¶¶ 170, 172-74, 
177). When a security experiences a sharp price increase, the Gamma increases; stated differently, options that were previously 
unlikely to reach their strike prices before expiration become more likely to. (See id. ¶ 176-78). As the Gamma increases, market 
makers hedge by purchasing more of the underlying security, which further drives the price of the security higher and creates a 
feedback loop as even deeper out of the money options approach their strike price. (See id. ¶ 178)."
916,13," An FTD occurs when one party in a trading contract, such as in a short transaction, does not deliver on its obligations. (See 
CCAC ¶ 214). FTDs are indicative of naked short selling, which occurs when a short seller does not actually possess the 
security it is supposed to borrow. (See id. ¶ 215). This practice is largely inaccessible to individual investors but accessible to 
market makers. (See id. ¶ 217). "
917,14," Private stock exchanges are known colloquially as ""dark pools"" or ""dark exchanges"" because they do not disseminate public 
quotations of securities prices. (See CCAC ¶¶ 151-54). Through these private exchanges, institutional investors can discreetly "
918,," buy or sell securities in large blocks, mitigating some of the price impacts that their buying or selling activity would otherwise 
have on a ""lit,"" or public, national securities exchange. (See id. ¶ 154). "
924,15," Plaintiffs find no support in In re Insurance Brokerage Antitrust Litigation, 618 F.3d 300, 324 n.23 (3d Cir. 2010). (See Resp. 
14). There, the court explained that direct conspiracy includes ""document[s] or conversation[s] explicitly manifesting the 
existence of the agreement in question[.]"" In re Ins. Brokerage Antitrust Litig., 618 F.3d at 324 n.23 (alterations added; citations 
omitted). As Plaintiffs concede, the alleged conversations between Citadel Securities and Robinhood were ""vague and do not 
describe the contents of what was agreed to in the communications"" — in other words, the opposite of explicit. (Resp. 14 n.6). "
925,16," Conscious parallelism is a ""process, not in itself unlawful, by which firms in a concentrated market might in effect share 
monopoly power, setting their prices at a profit-maximizing, supracompetitive level by recognizing their shared economic 
interests and their interdependence with respect to price and output decisions."" Brooke Grp. Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco 
Corp., 509 U.S. 209, 227, 113 S. Ct. 2578, 125 L. Ed. 2d 168 (1993) (citation omitted). "
926,17," Defendants' reliance on Anderson News, L.L.C. v. American Media, Inc., 899 F.3d 87 (2d Cir. 2018), is inapt. (See Mot. 28). 
There, after initially finding at the motion-to-dismiss stage that the varied responses by the defendants were inconsequential to a 
finding of parallel conduct, see Anderson News, L.L.C., 680 F.3d at 191, the Second Circuit held at the summary judgment stage 
that the defendants' conduct ""was not, in fact, parallel"" because ""evidence [*69]  presented at summary judgment undercut[] 
th[e] allegation"" of parallel conduct. Anderson News, L.L.C., 899 F.3d at 105 (alterations and emphasis added). "
927,18," While the varied restrictions do not preclude a finding of parallel conduct at this stage, they do influence the Court's plausibility 
analysis. "
929,19," This section addresses Plaintiffs' arguments raised in their Response under both the ""ample opportunity to coordinate and 
collude"" and ""acts [] inconsistent with unilateral conduct"" sections. (Resp. 22-24, 28-29 (alteration added)). "
931,20," In their Response, Plaintiffs also refer to phone calls between Apex and the Introducing Brokerages it serves. (See Resp. 24). 
As explained, absent animating details, the Court declines to find these phone calls suggestive of an illegal agreement. "
932,21," Contrary to Plaintiffs' suggestion, the fact that government regulators did not directly call on Defendants to restrict trading is 
inconsequential (see Resp. 25 n.18), because the restrictions lowered the volatility multiplier that determines DTCC collateral 
requirements (see, e.g, CCAC ¶ 470). "
937,*, This disposition is not an opinion of the full Court and pursuant to I.O.P. 5.7 does not constitute binding precedent. 
938,1," The District Court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 (federal questions), 1337 (commerce and antitrust regulations). 
This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291 (final judgments). "
941,2," The Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act of 2020 was enacted after the District Court dismissed LifeWatch's Third 
Amended Complaint. Accordingly, this opinion does not resolve the question of whether CHIRA applies to LifeWatch's prayer for 
injunctive relief. That issue was not a part of this dispute. "
957,1, Statutory references are to the Code of Civil Procedure unless otherwise specified. 
958,2," Bioavailability means “the rate and extent to which the active ingredient or active moiety is absorbed from a drug product and 
becomes available at the site of drug action.” (21 C.F.R. § 314.3 (2021).) "
959,3," Neurelis alleges that, at the time of the filing of Aquestive's Form S-1, Aquestive had not yet completed any clinical trials for 
Libervant. Although Aquestive did not mention Neurelis or Valtoco by name, Neurelis avers Aquestive made its statements “with 
Neurelis in mind.” Moreover, because Neurelis was further along in the development of Valtoco than Aquestive was with 
Libervant, Neurelis claims Aquestive's factual representations in the Form S-1 were false. "
962,4," HN9[
] CA(9)[
] (9) “[T]he legislative history of section 425.17 indicates it was drafted to track constitutional principles governing regulation of commercial speech based upon guidelines discussed in Kasky v. Nike, Inc. (2002) 27 Cal.4th 939 [119 
Cal.Rptr.2d 296, 45 P.3d 243] (Kasky). (See Assem. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of Sen. Bill No. 515 (2003–2004 Reg. Sess.) 
as amended June 27, 2003, p. 8.)” (JAMS, Inc. v. Superior Court (2016) 1 Cal.App.5th 984, 994 [205 Cal. Rptr. 3d 307], fn. 
omitted (JAMS).) In Kasky, our high court observed that three elements distinguish commercial speech from noncommercial 
speech: the speaker, the audience, and the content of the message. (Kasky, at p. 960.) "
963,5," CA(13)[
] (13) The California Supreme Court noted that “certain commercially oriented statements will fall outside the scope of section 425.17, subdivision (c).” (FilmOn.com, supra, 7 Cal.5th at p. 148.) The court further observed that “the language of 
section 425.17, subdivision (c) and subsequent case law indicate that the provision exempts ‘only a subset of commercial 
speech’—specifically, comparative advertising.” (Id. at p. 147.) However, in that case, the court was not considering whether 
certain speech fell under subdivision (c). (FilmOn.com, at p. 147, fn. 4.) Instead, the court discussed section 425.17, subdivision 
(c) for the purpose of interpreting the “catchall” provision of section 425.16, subdivision (e)(4). (FilmOn.com, at pp. 142–143, 
147–148.) We read nothing in FilmOn.com that precludes the applicability of the commercial speech exception under the facts 
before us. (See HN13[
] Nolan v. City of Anaheim (2004) 33 Cal.4th 335, 343 [14 Cal. Rptr. 3d 857, 92 P.3d 350] [“A 
decision, of course, does not stand for a proposition not considered by the court”].) "
966,6," To the extent an exception applies to the Noerr-Pennington doctrine, we will consider it during our second prong analysis of the 
anti-SLAPP motion. "
967,7," CA(19)[
] (19) Here, we observe that two of Neurelis's causes of action are mixed, meaning they rely on both protected and 
unprotected conduct. The UCL claim is based on Aquestive's private threats, its investor statements, and the citizen petition. 
Similarly, the defamation claim is based on the investor statements and the citizen petition. As we discussed ante, only the 
citizen petition is protected conduct under the anti-SLAPP statute. HN18[
] As such, Neurelis need only establish a probability 
of prevailing on its UCL and defamation claims based on the citizen petition. If it cannot do so, then the allegations concerning 
the citizen petition must be stricken. (See Baral, supra, 1 Cal.5th at p. 395.) However, we disregard the allegations concerning 
the unprotected conduct. (Id. at p. 396; Sheley v. Harrop (2017) 9 Cal.App.5th 1147, 1171 [215 Cal. Rptr. 3d 606].) As such, 
Neurelis does not have to prove a probability of success on the merits as to the UCL and defamation claims to the extent they 
are based on the private threats and/or investor statements. "
968,8," CA(25)[
] (25) We note the limited nature of our conclusion here. We are not determining, as a matter of law, that statements 
made in a citizen petition to the FDA are not covered by the litigation privilege. We merely find that Aquestive has not carried its 
burden of showing the application of the privilege on the record before us. HN24[
] One invoking the privilege must do more 
than simply point to the allegedly privileged document. "
969,9," For example, Aquestive requested that the FDA require Neurelis to conduct a bridging study comparing Valtoco and Diastat as 
well as a food effect study. In addition, Aquestive asked the FDA to determine “that Valtoco is not clinically superior to nor offers 
a major contribution to patient care when compared to Diastat.” Neurelis neither discusses these requests of the citizen petition 
nor explains how the publicly available information about nasal sprays renders these requests objectively without merit."
969,10," In denying the citizen petition, the FDA indicated that it had approved the new drug application for Valtoco. "
972,11," We note that Neurelis's malicious prosecution claim has evolved during its opposition to the anti-SLAPP motion. The operative 
complaint bases the malicious prosecution cause of action on all three IPR petitions. Yet, the ’451 Petition resulted in the Board 
invalidating the ’876 Patent. Therefore, Neurelis essentially tells us to ignore that petition. However, Neurelis all but concedes 
that it has no evidence that Aquestive lacked probable cause to bring the ’449 Petition. These meaningful shortcomings 
undermine the theory that Neurelis's advances as to the IPR petitions, that they were brought only to extort Neurelis to give up 
orphan drug exclusivity as to Valtoco. Clearly, the Board did not share Neurelis's conclusion about the validity of the petitions. "
973,12," 35 United States Code section 325(d) states: “Notwithstanding sections 135(a), 251, and 252, and chapter 30, during the 
pendency of any post-grant review under this chapter, if another proceeding or matter involving the patent is before the Office, 
the Director may determine the manner in which the post-grant review or other proceeding or matter may proceed, including 
providing for the stay, transfer, consolidation, or termination of any such matter or proceeding. In determining whether to institute 
or order a proceeding under this chapter, chapter 30, or chapter 31, the Director may take into account whether, and reject the 
petition or request because, the same or substantially the same prior art or arguments previously were presented to the Office.” "
978,1," GM requests that the Court take judicial notice of eight documents filed concurrently with its Motion to Dismiss. (ECF No. 38-2). 
Casey requests that the Court take judicial notice of one document filed concurrently with her Opposition to the Motion to 
Dismiss. (ECF No. 39-1). Judicial notice of all requested documents is denied, as judicial notice of the documents is 
unnecessary to this Order. "
979,2," The Court does not address Casey's argument that the Song-Beverly Act applies because the Vehicle was purchased pursuant 
to an option in a prior lease, as there are no facts concerning any prior lease alleged in the SAC. See Schneider v. Cal. Dept. of 
Corrections, 151 F.3d 1194, 1197 n.1 (9th Cir. 1998) (""'[N]ew' allegations contained in [Plaintiffs'] opposition motion, however, 
are irrelevant for Rule 12(b)(6) purposes."")."
979,3, Casey does not contend in her Opposition or allege in the SAC that GM has violated the fraudulent prong of the UCL. 
981,4," GM contends that the SAC should be dismissed with prejudice. Although Casey does not dispute this contention in her 
Opposition, dismissal with prejudice is inappropriate because the Court cannot conclude that further amendment would be futile 
at this point in time. "

1005,7," In other words, the law ""does not attribute remote consequences to a defendant,"" even if those consequences are foreseeable. 
Darnell-Taenzer, 245 U.S. at 533. Barring liability for foreseeable harms is not unusual. Such limits on liability can be found, for 
example, in the economic loss rule, see Akron Corp. v. M/T Cantigny, 706 F.2d 151, 153 (5th Cir. 1983) (noting that ""a party 
may not recover for economic losses not associated with physical damages"" so as ""to prevent limitless liability for negligence 
and the filing of law suits of a highly speculative nature""); see also RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF TORTS: LIAB. FOR ECON. HARM § 1 cmt. 
c(1) (Am. L. Inst. 2020) (noting that one of the rationales for limiting tort liability for economic loss is that ""[e]conomic losses 
proliferate more easily than losses of other kinds"" even though such losses ""may be at least generally foreseeable to the person 
who commits the negligent act""), and other limitations on liability for negligence, see 532 Madison Ave. Gourmet Foods, Inc. v. 
Finlandia Ctr., Inc., 96 N.Y.2d 280, 289, 750 N.E.2d 1097, 727 N.Y.S.2d 49 (2001) (""Absent a duty running directly to the injured 
person there can be no liability in damages, however careless the conduct or foreseeable the harm.""), and for negligent 
misrepresentation, see Restatement (Third) of Torts: Liab. for Econ. Harm § 5 cmt. b (""Liabilities that expand as easily as words 
travel would ... become indeterminate and unduly widespread in many cases.""). Even when the law extends a right to recover for 
derivative injury—such as emotional distress from witnessing another's accident—that right is often confined to close relations 
and excludes others in ways unrelated to foreseeability. Robert L. Rabin, Tort Recovery for Negligently Inflicted Economic Loss: 
A Reassessment, 37 Stan. L. Rev. 1513, 1522 (1985). The ""specter of collateral claims, virtually unlimited in number, as a result 
of any given accident""—not foreseeability—informs these limitations. Id. at 1525. "
1007,8," In making this finding, the district court in the Government Action explained that from 1997 to 2009, ""prohibitions on merchant 
steering"" enabled Visa and MasterCard to ""increase their average all-in merchant rates ... by more than 20% ... without fear of 
other networks undercutting their prices in order to gain [market] share."" 88 F. Supp. 3d at 216. Discover was ""forced to abandon 
its low-price strategy as a result of"" prohibitions on merchant steering and ""was able to raise its rates with virtual impunity, 
relying on the restraining effect of anti-steering rules to ensure that it would not be undercut by a competitor offering a lower 
price to merchants."" Id. ""These examples provide further support for the [district] court's finding that without affording merchants 
the ability to influence their customers' credit and charge card decisions"" through steering, ""there is little, if any, downward 
pressure on the price charged to merchants."" Id. Ohio did not question this finding. "
1008,9," The district court held that this fourth factor counseled against antitrust standing, and in its discussion of the factor expressed 
concern over the ""obvious risk of disproportionate damages."" Am. Express Anti-Steering, 433 F. Supp. 3d at 412 (quoting In re 
London Silver Fixing, Ltd., Antitrust Litig., 332 F. Supp. 3d 885, 906 (S.D.N.Y. 2018)). Yet the fourth efficient-enforcer factor 
concerns not the size of the damages awarded but the difficulty courts might face in dividing an award. We do not see such 
difficulty here."
1008,10," The appellants also seek injunctive relief under § 16 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 26. The appellants must demonstrate 
antitrust standing for that requested relief. Eastman Kodak Co. v. Henry Bath LLC, 936 F.3d 86, 94 (2d Cir. 2019). The Supreme 
Court has said that ""the difference in the remedy each section provides means that certain considerations relevant to a 
determination of standing under § 4 are not relevant under § 16."" Cargill, Inc. v. Monfort of Colo., Inc., 479 U.S. 104, 111 n.6, 
107 S. Ct. 484, 93 L. Ed. 2d 427 (1986). In particular, ""standing under § 16 raises no threat of multiple lawsuits or duplicative 
recoveries."" Id. Given that no damages are awarded under § 16, the third factor's inquiry into whether there is a ""high degree of 
speculation in a damages calculation"" is inapplicable. IQ Dental Supply, 924 F.3d at 66. Because the difference in remedies 
does not affect the proximate clause analysis, we hold that the appellants lack antitrust standing for the request for injunctive 
relief."
1008,11," This result does not mean that Amex could never be liable for allegedly raising prices throughout the market. As the district 
court noted, the Amex Class members can still litigate the Anti-Steering Rules through the arbitration process. Am. Express Anti-
Steering, 433 F. Supp. 3d at 411. In addition, at least one circuit court has held that an antitrust defendant may be held liable for 
umbrella effects on prices. See In re Processed Egg Prods. Antitrust Litig., 881 F.3d 262, 276 (3d Cir. 2018). "
1009,12," The district court properly concluded that ""dismissal of an underlying antitrust claim mandates dismissal of the UCL claim as 
well."" Am. Express Anti-Steering, 433 F. Supp. 3d at 416. ""The UCL permits any person acting for the interests of itself, its 
members or the general public to initiate an action ... against a person or business entity who has engaged in any unlawful, 
unfair, or fraudulent business act or practice."" Quelimane Co. v. Stewart Title Guar. Co., 19 Cal. 4th 26, 77 Cal. Rptr. 2d 709, 
960 P.2d 513, 521-22 (Cal. 1998) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Because the UCL claim is predicated on 
violations of the Sherman and Cartwright Acts, we affirm the dismissal of that claim as well. "
1016,1," ""Specifically excluded from the Class are Defendant, Defendant's officers, directors, agents, trustees, parents, children,

1026,2," The Court granted SCU's unopposed request for judicial notice of this document. See Section III, supra. 23 "
1034,1," Certain types of group boycotts have also been found to be per se illegal, but ""precedent limits the per se rule in the boycott 
context to cases involving horizontal agreements among direct competitors."" NYNEX Corp. v. Discon, Inc. 525 U.S. 128, 135, 
119 S. Ct. 493, 142 L. Ed. 2d 510 (1998). "
1038,2," In Alston, the Supreme Court affirmed a judgment that evaluated the NCAA's limit on education-related compensation under 
the rule of reason. Id at 10-11 (majority opinion). However, for many years, the Supreme Court has declined to condemn the 
NCAA's restraints as illegal per se because the ""horizontal restraints on competition are essential if the product is to be available 
at all."" Nat'l Collegiate Athletic Ass'n v. Bd. of Regents of Univ. of Okla., 468 U.S. 85, 101, 104 S. Ct. 2948, 82 L. Ed. 2d 70 
(1984). In these situations—where collaboration is essential among certain actors for there to be a product at all—the rule of 
reason applies regardless of the nature of the restraint at issue. See id. at 103. Accordingly, contrary to Defendants' argument, 
that the Supreme Court evaluated the NCAA's wage-fixing under the rule of reason does not justify the rule of reason in this 
case. "
1040,3," "". . . Jindal, Rodgers, and co-conspirators knowingly entered into and engaged in a conspiracy to suppress competition by 
agreeing to fix prices by lowering the pay rates to PTs and PTAs"" (Dkt. #21 at pp. 3-4)."
1040,4," ""During the Relevant Period, the business activities of Jindal, Rodgers, and their co-conspirators that are the subject of the 
conspiracy charged in this Count were within the flow of, and substantially affected, interstate trade and commerce. For 
example, during the Relevant Period: (a) Insurance funds, including federal Medicare funds, traveled from banks or companies 
located in states outside of Texas through a home health agency to Company A in Texas, and from Company A to its PTs and 
PTAs to pay them for providing care to patients; (b) To provide care in patients homes and assisted living facilities, PTs and 
PTAs used equipment and vehicles purchased in interstate commerce; and (c) The conspiracy was intended to lower rates paid 
to PTs and PTAs, which would lessen their purchases in interstate trade and commerce"" (Dkt. #21 at p. 6). "

when it has not been alleged or shown that any witness would be unwilling to testify."" Id. at 499 (internal quotation marks 
omitted). Nevertheless, despite this lack of specificity, the Sixth Circuit affirmed the district court's dismissal of the Hefferans' 
case because ""[r]elative ease of access to sources of proof and the availability of compulsory process for proceedings abroad 
support dismissal."" Similarly, Adient and Lear's failure to specifically allege that certain foreign witnesses will not testify in the 
United States is not fatal to their forum non conveniens argument. "
1095,4," The Court acknowledges Prevent's assertion that Adient and Lear are not named in any of the German lawsuits and thus the 
actions cannot be called ""parallel."" ECF No. 40, PageID.2399. Nevertheless, Prevent assigned claims arising from the March 
2018 termination of its seat cover supply agreements to an entity established to bring such claims on behalf of the Prevent 
Group. See ECF No. 35-11, PageID.1669. While Adient and Lear are not named in that litigation, the complaint refers to the third

146 (9th Cir. 1989) (en banc), for example, we articulated five different factors that, although largely overlapping with those 
identified in American Ad Management, included two factors that we did not specifically mention in American Ad Management: 
""[t]he specific intent of the alleged conspirators"" and ""[t]he existence of other, more appropriate plaintiffs."" We nevertheless rely 
on the American Ad Management factors to frame our analysis. Among other virtues, they adhere closely to the factors identified 
by Areeda and Hovenkamp in their influential treatise on antitrust law: Unlike the United States government, which is authorized to sue anyone who violates the antitrust laws, a private antitrust 
plaintiff must show ""standing"" to sue. In addition to proving everything that would entitle the government to relief, the private 
plaintiff must also show (1) that the acts violating the antitrust laws caused—or, in an equity case, threatened to cause—it 
injury-in-fact to its ""business or property;"" (2) that this injury is not too remote or duplicative of the recovery of a more 
directly injured person; (3) that such injury is ""antitrust injury,"" which is defined as the kind of injury that the antitrust laws 
were intended to prevent and ""flows from that which makes defendants' acts unlawful""; and, in a damage case, (4) that the 
damages claimed or awarded measure such [**23]  injury in a reasonably quantifiable way. Areeda & Hovenkamp ¶ 335 (footnotes omitted). Although American Ad Management did not mention the requirement that a 
plaintiff show injury to its ""business or property,"" that is indisputably an additional requirement for antitrust standing under § 4 of "
1136,," the Clayton Act. See 15 U.S.C. § 15(a); Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co. of Cal., 405 U.S. 251, 260-61, 92 S. Ct. 885, 31 L. Ed. 2d 
184 (1972). "
1138,11," The Tenth Circuit did not adopt a bright-line rule precluding nonpurchasers who have been priced out of a market from 
establishing antitrust standing. See Montreal Trading, 661 F.2d at 868. We agree."
1138,12, The City's injuries would also be less direct than those of NFL expansion teams denied entry into the league. 
1139,13," In Microsoft, 253 F.3d 34, the plaintiffs were required to prove that Microsoft's anticompetitive practices (i.e., foreclosing 
Netscape's and Java's distribution channels) caused Microsoft to maintain its monopoly power in the operating system market. 
In that context, and relying on Areeda & Hovenkamp, the D.C. Circuit reasoned that courts could infer causation from the fact 
that a defendant has engaged in anticompetitive conduct that reasonably appears capable of making a significant contribution to 
maintaining monopoly power. Id. at 79. The court did not address the question presented here. "
1143,1," In reaching the merits of the price-fixing claim, the majority imports a Tenth Circuit case into our court—Montreal Trading Ltd. v. 
Amax Inc., 661 F.2d 864 (10th Cir. 1981). In Montreal Trading, the Tenth Circuit denied antitrust standing to non-purchasers on 
the theory that their injuries were too uncertain. Id. at 868. I question, however, whether Montreal Trading is relevant here. 
Montreal Trading explained that nonpurchasers should be denied standing to sue ""when they lack a past course of dealing with 
the conspirators."" Id. But Oakland, the Raiders, and the NFL have a long course of dealing, making the applicability of the 
Montreal Trading rule suspect. Moreover, the majority applies Montreal Trading without claiming to adopt it as a ""bright-line rule"" 
for our circuit. Maj. Op. 29 n.11. But doing so just further complicates an already complicated area of law. The majority should 
have punted on this issue. "

1166,1," SSNIP is a common methodology for defining a relevant antitrust market. To perform a SSNIP analysis, an economist 
proposes a narrow geographic and product market definition and then iteratively expands that definition until a hypothetical 
monopolist in the proposed market would be able to profitably make a small but significant non-transitory increase in price 
(""SSNIP""). At each step, if consumers would respond to a SSNIP by making purchases outside the proposed market definition, 
thereby rendering the SSNIP unprofitable, then the proposed market definition is too narrow. At the next step, the economist 
expands the proposed geographic or product market definition to include the substituted products or area. This process is 
repeated until a SSNIP in the proposed market is predicted to be profitable for the hypothetical monopolist. See St. Alphonsus 
Med. Ctr. - Nampa Inc. v. St. Luke's Health Sys., Ltd., 778 F.3d 775, 784 (9th Cir. 2015). "
1173,1," Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (""Rule"") 25(d), ""[t]he officer's successor is automatically substituted as a party"" 
when a public officer ""ceases to hold office while the action is pending."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 25(d). Accordingly, Rob Bonta is 
automatically substituted as a party for Xavier Becerra, the former Attorney General of the State of California. The Clerk of the 
Court is directed to update the docket as necessary."
1173,2," The following factual background is taken mostly verbatim from the Court's December 31, 2019 Order denying Plaintiff's motion 
for preliminary injunction in the related case. (See ECF No. 29, No. 2:19-cv-02281-TLN-DB.) "
1174,3," The State requests the Court take judicial notice of Exhibits A through E, Assembly Committee on Health AB 824 Bill Analysis 
(March 26, 2019), Assembly Floor Analysis of AB 824 (September 4, 2019), Letters of Support for AB 824, Table 8: Total All 
Payers State Estimates by State of Residence (1991-2004) — Drugs and Other Non-durable Products (Millions of Dollars), 
Health expenditures by state of residence: Summary tables, and Pay-for-Delay: How Drug Company Pay-Offs Cost Consumers 
Billions, FTC Staff Study (Jan. 2010), respectively. (ECF No. 20-1.) Plaintiff has not filed an opposition to this request. The Court "
1175,," previously took judicial notice of these exact documents in the prior suit (ECF No. 29 at 5-6, No. 2:19-cv-02281-TLN-DB) and for 
the same reasons now GRANTS the State's request for judicial notice. The Court has also reviewed and considered the amici curiae brief submitted by the American Antitrust Institute, Consumer 
Reports, Inc., and Public Citizen, Inc. in support of AB 824's implementation and enforcement. (See ECF Nos. 19-2, 22.) "
1177,4," The Court agrees with the State that Plaintiff alleges that AB 824 unlawfully regulates extraterritorial activity — especially in 
light of the fact that the Ninth Circuit has identified the case law Plaintiff cites as pertaining to extraterritoriality arguments and 
that Plaintiff does not argue any other theory in its briefing. (ECF No. 15-1 at 14-16 (citing Healy v. Beer Inst., 491 U.S. 324, 332, 
109 S. Ct. 2491, 105 L. Ed. 2d 275 (1989); Brown-Forman Distillers Corp. v. N.Y. State Liquor Auth. (Brown-Forman), 476 U.S. 
573, 579, 106 S. Ct. 2080, 90 L. Ed. 2d 552 (1986)); see also ECF Nos. 15-1, 26); Rocky Mt. Farmers Union, 730 F.3d at 1101 
(citing Healy, 491 U.S. at 336; Brown-Forman, 476 U.S. at 579). Accordingly, this Court will only address the argument regarding 
extraterritoriality. "
1179,5," The statute defines a ""nonreference drug filer"" as ""[a]n ANDA filer"" or ""[a] biosimilar biological product application filer."" Cal. 
Health & Safety Code § 134000(g). "
1180,6," The State contends that ""if manufacturers want to avoid application of AB 824 to agreements they enter into, they can do so 
simply by omitting California sales from those covered by the agreement,"" impliedly arguing that the provisions of AB 824 will not 
be enforced against parties entering into settlement agreements covering pharmaceutical sales outside of California. (ECF No. 
20 at 19.) The State continually emphasizes in its opposition that AB 824 ""does not regulate conduct occurring wholly outside 
California,"" ""sets the terms of doing business in California,"" and ""governs the prices for which goods are sold in California."" (Id. 
at 18-19.) The Court ultimately does not find this argument persuasive as AB 824 on its face does not include such a limitation to 
California sales. 2019 Cal. Legis. Serv. 531; see also Smallwood v. Allied Van Lines, Inc., 660 F.3d 1115, 1121 (9th Cir. 
2011) (For purposes of statutory interpretation, ""[u]nder the 'plain meaning' rule, '[w]here the language [of a statute] is plain and 
admits of no more than one meaning[,] the duty of interpretation does not arise, and the rules which are to aid doubtful meanings 
need no discussion."" (citing Carson Harbor Vill., Ltd. v. Unocal Corp., 270 F.3d 863, 878 (9th Cir. 2001) (en banc)). The Court 
therefore cannot read ""California sales"" into the statute where it was not written by the State Legislature. "
1190,1," Dexon includes more factual allegations in its opposition brief, but these are not properly before the court on this motion. See, 
e.g., MTD Opp. (dkt. 81) at 26-27, 30. "
1192,2," It is at least theoretically possible for a firm to harm competitors by locking customers into a costly long-term service plan and 
then requiring purchases in a tied equipment market that customers en masse (for some set of reasons) cannot refuse. But no 
court that has yet found such an arrangement, and the conditions necessary are far away from the facts alleged here. "
1194,3," In Cisco Sys. Inc. v. Link US, LLC, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 212028, 2019 WL 6682838 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 6, 2019), this Court held 
that a counterclaim plaintiff stated a UCL fraud claim based on Cisco's misleadingly broad definition of ""used"" equipment. Cf. id. 
¶¶ 111-13 (making a similar allegation). The Court permitted the claim to proceed, explaining that reliance need not be pleaded 
specifically, and apparently assuming that reliance by third parties could be cognizable. However, the Court did not consider this 
question. The Court does so today and adopts the majority approach. "
1206,1," O.R.S. 696.375(2) requires the Commissioner to have previously held a real estate license and to have been active in the real 
estate business prior to appointment. The statute does not require the Commissioner to have an active real estate license while 
holding office. Plaintiff acknowledges its error after Defendants provided evidence that Commissioner Strode deactivated his real 
estate license upon being appointed Commissioner."
1206,2," The Court notes that the majority of state statutes cited by Plaintiff do not explicitly use the word ""rebate"" as O.R.S. 
696.290(1)(a) does. Whether, within a particular context, the term ""rebate"" may be interpreted differently is not before the Court. 
The Court finds that the Agency's interpretation is consistent with the plain meaning of the statute. "
1207,3," Under O.R.S. 696.290(1)(a), ""any person who is not a real estate licensee"" includes individuals exempt from license 
requirements under O.R.S. § 696.030. Such persons include ""[a] nonlicensed individual transferring or acquiring an interest in 
real estate owned or to be owned by the nonlicensed individual."" O.R.S. § 696.030(17). Thus, HN10[
] Oregon law specifically 
prohibits a real estate licensee from providing ""any part or share of the licensee's compensation"" to a person who is the buyer or 
seller of the real property that is the subject of the transaction. O.R.S. 696.290(1)(a)."
1207,4," The Court declines to opine on the wisdom of Oregon's anti-rebate policy. ""The Court did not suggest in Parker, nor has it 
suggested since, that a state action is exempt from antitrust liability only if the sovereign acted wisely[.] The only requirement is 
that the action be that of the State acting as a sovereign."" Hoover, 466 U.S. at 574 (internal quotations and citation omitted). "
1208,5," Defendants do not challenge whether Plaintiff has third-party standing to assert claims on behalf of its customers. The Court 
does not address this issue in detail but notes that federal courts commonly recognize an exception to the rule against third-
party standing when commercial businesses assert the rights of their customers. See Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 97 S. Ct. 
451, 50 L. Ed. 2d 397 (1976) (""[V]endors and those in like positions have been uniformly permitted to resist the efforts at 
restricting their operations by acting as advocates of the rights of third parties who seek access to their market or function.""). "
1209,6," ""No law shall be passed granting to any citizen or class of citizens privileges, or immunities, which, upon the same terms, shall 
not equally belong to all citizens."" OR. CONST., art I, § 20. "
1212,1," While others will be cited and discussed in greater detail below, the following factual allegations drawn from the complaint 
provide relevant context for resolving Defendants' motion. The Court construes these factual allegations as true. See Mollett v. 
Netflix, Inc., 795 F.3d 1062, 1065 (9th Cir. 2015)."
1212,2," While the complaint explains that Jain Distribution is the holding company for Irrigation Design and Agri-Valley—and that both 
Jain Distribution and Jain Irrigation are wholly owned subsidiaries of Jain Irrigation Limited, ""an Indian multi-national 
conglomerate"" that has not itself been sued in this action—Netafim's allegations describing the acquisition singly identify Jain 
Irrigation as the active Jain participant. Compl., ¶¶ 1, 4-5, 29-38. Nonetheless, the parties' briefing on Defendants' motion does 
not recognize a distinction between the separate Jain entities. Thus, for purposes of this order, the Court will adopt that practice 
as well. "
1213,3," As acknowledged in the complaint and Defendants' unopposed request for judicial notice, the parties here have been involved 
in other adversarial litigation in federal and state court. Compl., ¶¶ 56-58; Doc. No. 15-2. See Jain Irrigation, Inc. v. Netafim 
Irrigation, Inc., 386 F. Supp. 3d 1308 (E.D. Cal. 2019); Jain Irrigation, Inc. v. Netafim Irrigation, Inc., No. 37-2019-00035422-CU-
AT-CTL (Cal. Super. Ct. filed July 8, 2019). Notwithstanding this notice, the Court's resolution of this motion is not affected by 
these separate proceedings. "
1214,4," Defendants also assert that Netafim's Clayton Act claim against Irrigation Design and Agri-Valley must fail as the language of 
Section 7 only applies to acquirers of assets, not sellers. Netafim does not respond to this assertion. Defendants are correct as 
to the language of the Clayton Act provision. 15 U.S.C. § 18 (stating in multiple contexts that ""no person shall acquire""). But the 
Ninth Circuit has also recognized that sellers may be joined in a Section 7 claim if the court requires jurisdiction over both the 
selling and acquiring entities to fashion equitable relief. United States v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of L.A., 575 F.2d 222, 230-31 
(9th Cir. 1978) (discussing Section 15 of the Clayton Act, which is codified at 15 U.S.C. § 25). For purposes of its Section 7 
claim, Netafim seeks both equitable relief and damages from all Defendants. Compl., Prayer for Relief. Recognizing the statutory 
language and the controlling precedent, the Court will dismiss that claim as to Irrigation Design and Agri-Valley with respect to 
damages. Gerlinger v. Amazon.Com, Inc., 311 F. Supp. 2d 838, 852 (N.D. Cal. 2004); Fricke-Parks Press, Inc. v. Fang, 149 F. 
Supp. 2d 1175, 1186 (N.D. Cal. 2001). "
1216,5," This describes a monopoly market situation, where the seller holds market power. If market power is instead possessed by a 
buyer or group of buyers, the market situation is alternatively described as a monopsony. United States v. Syufy Enters., 903 
F.2d 659, 663 & n.4 (9th Cir. 1990). These similar yet unique forms of market power are generally treated as equivalent for 
purposes of antitrust law. Weyerhaeuser Co. v. Ross-Simmons Hardwood Lumber Co., 549 U.S. 312, 321-22, 127 S. Ct. 1069, 
166 L. Ed. 2d 911 (2007). In the context of a monopsony, however, the relevant geographic market definition captures the area 
in which sellers are able to turn to other buyers as reasonably good substitutes. Todd v. Exxon Corp., 275 F.3d 191, 201-02 (2d 
Cir. 2001) (explaining generally how market definitions are affected by different market situations)."
1216,6," Defendants ask the Court to take judicial notice of a map of Central California that identifies the twelve zip codes that are 
referenced in Netafim's allegations. Doc. No. 15-2. Although maps are frequently a subject of judicial notice, the Court resolves 
this portion of Defendants' motion without need for notice of this particular map. "
1217,7," The same is true regarding Netafim's own case law authority. See Saint Alphonsus Med. Ctr.-Nampa Inc. v. St. Luke's Health 
Sys., Ltd., 778 F.3d 775, 783-85 (9th Cir. 2015) (relevant geographic market of the city of Nampa); Movie 1 & 2 v. United Artists 
Commc'ns, Inc., 909 F.2d 1245, 1248 (9th Cir. 1990) (relevant geographic market of the greater Santa Cruz area); United States 
v. Trib. Publ'g Co., No. CV 16-01822-AB (PJWx), 2016 WL 2989488, at *3-4 (C.D. Cal. Mar. 18, 2016) (relevant geographic 
market of Orange County and Riverside County). "
1218,8," To that end, if it chooses to amend its relevant market allegations, Netafim may also amend its market power allegations as it 
deems necessary. "
1219,9," For instance, if the design firms accounted for 100% of Netafim's sales in a specific area, but Netafim's sales only accounted 
for a small fraction of the total sales in that area, the design firms would not possess dominant market shares based on their 
business with Netafim alone. "
1242,1," The Mylan Defendants include Mylan N.V., Mylan Specialty L.P., Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc., and Heather Bresch. Doc. 2169 
at 1. This Order refers to these four defendants collectively as ""the Mylan Defendants"" or ""Mylan."""
1242,2," The Mylan Defendants' motion asks the court to set the matter for oral argument ""if the Court believes that would be helpful."" 
Doc. 2389 at 2. Our local rule, D. Kan. Rule 7.2, gives the court discretion to ""set any motion for oral argument or hearing at the 
request of a party or on its own initiative."" The court finds here that the parties' extensive papers adequately argue the issues 
raised by the Mylan Defendants' Motion to Decertify. Oral argument isn't necessary or consistent with Fed. R. Civ. P. 1. So, the 
court declines to set oral argument on this motion. "
1245,3," At class certification, the Antitrust States included: Alabama, California, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, 
Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Utah. Doc. 2018-1 at 
126 n.72. On summary judgment, however, the court dismissed the Tennessee antitrust claims without prejudice because no 
properly-named plaintiff resides in that state. Doc. 2381 at 163, 182. So, 16 Antitrust States currently remain part of the certified 
class action. "
1246,4," Plaintiffs assert four arguments why TransUnion doesn't require the court to decertify the class. Doc. 2404 at 20-22. Also, 
plaintiffs argue that accepting Mylan's argument that the court must decertify the state antitrust class because it contains some 
number of uninjured class members ""would be a potential death knell to generic delay claims—and many other types of class 
actions."" Id. at 22-23. Because the court finds that plaintiffs have shown they are capable of presenting classwide evidence of 
generic delay damages sustained by every class member, thus satisfying Article III standing, the court need not address 
plaintiffs' other arguments. "
1247,5," As plaintiffs note, the court already concluded, when deciding defendants' Motion to Dismiss the Consolidated Class Action 
Complaint, that plaintiffs had ""alleged economic loss sufficient to discharge the standing requirement"" by alleging that ""Mylan's 
conduct caused them to pay inflated prices for the EpiPen, and—but for Mylan's unlawful conduct—they would have purchased 
other versions of the EpiPen (both branded and generic) at lower cost."" Doc. 896 at 102-03 (citations omitted). But, the court 
also recognizes, this ruling addressed plaintiffs' state consumer protection act claims, not the antitrust claims. See id. at 99-104. "
1248,6," Mylan also contends that its updated rebate data is only relevant to Prof. Rosenthal's opinions about net prices, not gross 
prices. But, as Prof. Rosenthal explains, she used two sets of data—the IQVIA Xponent data and the Mylan rebate data—to 
conduct the updated pricing analysis. Doc. 2438-2 at 4-5 & n.5 (Rosenthal Sur-Reply Decl. ¶¶ 3, 5 & Fig. 3). "
1249,7," Mylan never applied to the court for permission to take Prof. Rosenthal's deposition about the opinions she's formed based on 
the updated data. When it comes to litigating aggressively, no one can accuse either side of the caption of shyness. "
1251,8," The class only consists of consumers or TPPs who purchased EpiPens during the relevant class period. Plaintiffs aren't 
asserting claims based on Auvi-Q or Adrenaclick purchases. "
1252,9," Plaintiffs' Opposition to the Motion to Decertify also argues that consumers sustained injury caused by the alleged generic 
delay through a ""loss of choice"" to purchase a generic EAI. Doc. 2404 at 12. As Mylan correctly argues, the court's summary 
judgment Order recognized that ""those class members who chose to purchase branded EpiPen products over a generic 
sustained no loss of choice."" Doc. 2381 at 179. Also, plaintiffs conceded at summary judgment that ""Prof. Rosenthal's 'loss of 
choice' opinion is not a measure of damages."" Id. (citing Doc. 2183-1 at 20). So, Mylan argues, plaintiffs' loss of choice argument 
isn't evidence of classwide injury sufficient to support class certification of the state antitrust class. Because the court already 
has determined that plaintiffs have come forward with evidence of classwide injury consisting of Prof. Rosenthal's overcharge 
theory of damages, the court need not further address plaintiffs' ""loss of choice"" argument. "
1253,10," Originally, the Consolidated Class Action Complaint named two plaintiffs who purchased EpiPens in Nevada: Local 282 and 
Miriam Clarke. Doc. 60 at 11, 19 (Compl. ¶¶ 10, 41). Ms. Clarke voluntarily dismissed her claims against Mylan on February 7, 
2018. Doc. 139 at 1. Thus, Local 282 is the only remaining named plaintiff and class representative for Nevada EpiPen 
purchasers."
1253,11," Likewise, the Consolidated Class Action Complaint named two plaintiffs who purchased EpiPens in North Carolina: Local 282 
and Cassandra Cobb. Doc. 60 at 11, 20 (Compl. ¶¶ 10, 47). Ms. Cobb voluntarily dismissed her claims against Mylan on 
February 7, 2018. Doc. 139 at 1. Thus, Local 282 is the only remaining named plaintiff and class representative for North 
Carolina EpiPen purchasers. "
1255,12," Mylan makes similar arguments about named plaintiffs Teia Amell (Maryland) and Meredith Krimmel (Texas)—i.e., that their 
deposition testimony establishes they are brand loyalists who sustained no injury. See Doc. 2423-1 at 32 n.20. But, these named 
plaintiffs aren't part of the state antitrust class action because Maryland and Texas aren't included in the 16 Antitrust States. In 
any event, the court agrees with plaintiffs. These two named plaintiffs' deposition testimony doesn't establish definitively that 
they are EpiPen brand loyalists. "
1261,1," After the filing of the instant motions, Defendants Tyson Foods, Inc., Tyson Fresh Meats, Inc., Tyson Prepared Foods, Inc. are 
in the process of settling the class claims against them in this matter. (D.E. 265.)"
1261,2," On May 26, 2020, the district court consolidated Case No. 19 C 8318 with Case No. 20 C 2295 (D.E. 139.) Except where 
noted, citations to docket entries in this order are to the docket in No. 19 C 8318. This matter is before the magistrate judge on a 
referral for discovery supervision. (D.E. 267, 268.)"
1261,3," ""Downstream discovery"" refers to ""documents and data reflecting a purchaser's use or sale of a product after the purchase."" In 
re Plasma-Derivative Protein Therapies Antitrust Litig., 09 C 7666, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 61114, 2012 WL 1533221, *1 
(N.D. Ill. April 27, 2012). Specifically, Defendants seek the following information from both the DPPs and the IPPs: (1) 
documents sufficient to show how prices for turkey are set (RFP 22); (2) sales data for turkey (RFP 26); (3) documents sufficient 
to show orders and backlog of turkey sold by Plaintiffs (RFP 27); (4) documents sufficient to show the geographic markets for 
which Plaintiffs sell turkey (RFP 29); (5) documents sent to, or received from others regarding actual or potential sales or 
purchases of turkey (RFP 32); and (6) documents sent to, or received from others regarding the processing of turkey (RFP 33). 
(Def. Mots. to Compel. at 4). All parties appear to accept that all of these requests concern ""downstream data,"" discussed below 
in Part III. "
1262,4," There are three other related cases that have been consolidated with the two cases here - 21 C 3763, 21 C 4131, and 21 C 
3551 - that are not at issue in this motion."
1262,5," The Supreme Court held in Hanover Shoe, Inc. v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., 392 U.S. 481, 88 (1968), and Illinois Brick Co. 
v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 735, 97 S. Ct. 2061, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1977), that only direct purchasers had standing to bring suit 
under the federal antitrust laws. A number of states subsequently passed ""Illinois Brick repealer statutes"" which allow indirect 
purchasers to sue for ""passed-on"" damages under the particular state's antitrust law. In re Broiler Chicken Antitrust Litig., 290 
F. Supp. 3d 772, 815 (N.D. Ill. 2017). A pass-through (or pass-on) defense says that in such state cases, a defendant is liable 
only for damages for alleged overcharges that were not ""passed on"" by the direct purchaser to successive buyers. "
1263,6," Although it appears that this issue was debated at the parties' meet-and-confer sessions, Plaintiffs' briefs do not dispute the 
existence of state antitrust laws or that at least some of them allow for a pass-through defense in certain situations, including 
some of the statutes under which the IPPs have sued Defendants. Plaintiffs argue that none of the situations that allow pass-
through exist in this case for any of the various state antitrust statutes. However, as we explain below, our decision on this 
motion is not the proper vehicle for detailed statutory construction of a dozen or more state antitrust statutes. We are 
comfortable that there is a better-than-likely chance that pass-through will be an issue under one or more statutes and therefore 
for the purposes of this decision we accept that such defense is available to Defendants to some extent, although we give no 
opinion about the exact scope of any individual statute or the evidence needed to prove the defense."
1263,7," The third named direct purchaser plaintiff, Olean Wholesale Grocery Cooperative, was voluntarily dismissed from the case with 
prejudice on October 11, 2021. (D.E. 309.) "
1264,8," Some of the DPPs' cases are of little help either. In re Plasma-Derivative Protein Therapies Antitrust Litig. Nos. 09-cv-7666, 11-
cv-1468, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 61114, 2012 WL 153321, at *3 (N.D. Ill. April 27, 2012), disallowed downstream discovery, but 
the matter before the court in that case was a direct purchaser action only. In re Vitamins Antitrust Litigation, 198 F.R.D. at 299, 
involved both direct and indirect purchaser plaintiff cases, but the disallowed downstream discovery was not relevant because 
defendants did not seek it to assert a pass-through defense but instead to assert consumer demand, and Plaintiffs' expert had 
used publicly available information to make his determinations, rendering additional discovery unnecessary. "
1265,9," For example, IPPs site Clayforth v. Pfizer, Inc., 233 P.3d 1066, 1070 (Cal. 2010), which discussed California's Cartwright Act. 
(IPP's Response to Mot. to Compel at 5). In Clayforth, the court explained that where multiple levels of purchasers have sued or 
there remains a risk they may sue, and damages are to be allocated among ""various levels of injured purchasers,"" defendants 
assert a pass-through defense to avoid duplicative damages. The IPPs suggest in their response that the Cartwright Act is ""like 
New York's Donnelly Act, under which Defendants seek downstream discovery from CIIPP Sandee's."" (IPPs' Resp. to Mot. to 
Compel at 5.) "
1270,1," The factual and procedural backgrounds of this matter are well-known to the parties and were previously recounted by the 
Court in its Opinion granting in part and denying in part Defendants' Motion to Dismiss the First Amended Complaint (ECF No. 
252), as well as the Court's Opinion granting in part and denying in part Defendants' Motion to Dismiss the Second Amended 
Complaint (ECF No. 304). Therefore, the Court includes only the facts and procedural background relevant to this Motion. "
1271,2," The Plaintiffs frequently use the terms ""benchmark price"" and ""sticker price"" to refer to the AWP. (See, e.g., ECF No. 411 ¶¶ 2, 
3, 202, 343.) "
1272,3," Under Count Ten of the Third Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs assert ""[t]his claim is brought by all plaintiffs against Defendants 
Novo Nordisk, Sanofi, and Eli Lilly, and alleges violations of the civil conspiracy laws of the following states: Alabama, Arizona, 
Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, 
Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North 
Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, and Wisconsin."" (ECF No. 
411 ¶ 525.) "
1273,4," Defendants sought to dismiss Counts Five (Florida) and Seven (North Carolina), but Plaintiffs have voluntarily withdrawn both 
Counts. (ECF No. 455 at 6.) Accordingly, the Court need not address them."
1273,5," With exception to the voluntarily withdrawn Counts, Defendants do not object to the adequacy of pleadings of the State RICO 
Claims. Rather, Defendants contend Plaintiffs cannot ""sidestep the indirect purchaser rule's bar on federal RICO claims simply 
by asserting claims under state analogues of RICO."" (ECF No. 422 at 8.) Therefore, the Court addresses only the applicability of 
the indirect purchaser rule to the State RICO Claims. "
1277,6," To the extent Defendants contend this Court is bound by the Third Circuit's ruling in McCarthy, the holding was limited to 
federal RICO claims. Day & Zimmermann, Inc. v. Challoner, 423 U.S. 3, 4, 96 S. Ct. 167, 46 L. Ed. 2d 3 (1975) (""A federal court 
in a diversity case is not free to engraft onto those state rules exceptions or modifications which may commend themselves to 
the federal court, but which have not commended themselves to the State in which the federal court sits.""). Notwithstanding, 
because the Court utilizes federal RICO case law to guide its interpretation of state RICO statutes, the Third Circuit's reasoning 
is persuasive for adjudicating the state racketeering claims."
1277,7," Plaintiffs contend ""Georgia courts have not required that plaintiffs be direct purchasers; instead, courts have engaged in a 
proximate causation analysis."" (ECF No. 455 at 12.) However, Plaintiffs are conflating the indirect purchaser rule with the 
proximate cause requirement, which, ""while related, are 'two analytically distinct aspects' of standing."" In re Zantac (Ranitidine) 
Prods. Liab. Litig., 546 F. Supp. 3d 1216, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 122580, at *36 (quoting McCarthy, 80 F.3d at 851). Indeed, 
Plaintiffs have not identified any Georgia case law addressing the applicability of the indirect purchaser rule, and the cases they 
rely on do not involve indirect purchaser standing. See e.g. Quasebarth v. Green Tree Servicing, LLC, 90 F. Supp. 3d 1373, 
1382-83 (M.D. Ga. 2015) (considering standing for mortgagee plaintiffs who directly contacted the mortgage loan servicer 
defendant); Wylie v. Denton, 323 Ga. App. 161, 746 S.E.2d 689, 694-95 (Ga. Ct. App. 2013) (holding a former bank employee 
lacked standing against former employer because the loss of employment was only indirectly caused by the bank's alleged 
wrongdoing); InterAgency, Inc. v. Danco Fin. Corp., 203 Ga. App. 418, 417 S.E.2d 46 (Ga. Ct. App. 1992) (holding the 
corporation stated a cause of action under RICO against brokers—without any discussion of standing—where the corporation 
cancelled its letter of intent to purchase a travel agency from the brokers and the brokers retained the funds). "
1279,8," Section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 15(a), provides: any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue 
therefor in any district court of the United States in the district in which the defendant resides or is found or has an agent, 
without respect to the amount in controversy, and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained, and the cost of 
suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee."
1279,9," The civil action provision in Arizona antitrust statute provides: A person threatened with injury or injured in his business or property by a violation of this article may bring an action for 
appropriate injunctive or other equitable relief, damages sustained and, as determined by the court, taxable costs and 
reasonable attorney's fees. If the trier of fact finds that the violation is flagrant, it shall increase recovery to an amount not in 
excess of three times the damages sustained. Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 44-1408(B). "
1280,10," The Wisconsin Illinois Brick repealer provision provides: Except as provided under par. (b), any person injured, directly or indirectly, by reason of anything prohibited by this chapter 
may sue therefor and shall recover threefold the damages sustained by the person and the cost [*40]  of the suit, including 
reasonable attorney fees. Wis. Stat. Ann. § 133.18 (1)(a). The Utah Illinois Brick repealer statute provision provides: A person who is a citizen of this state or a resident of this state and who is injured or is threatened with injury in his 
business or property by a violation of the Utah Antitrust Act may bring an action for injunctive relief and damages, 
regardless of whether the person dealt directly or indirectly with the defendant. Utah Code Ann. § 76-10-3109(1)(a)."
1280,11," By way of comparison, the Court has identified states that have enacted Illinois Brick repealer statutes to their state RICO 
statutes. Under Ohio's racketeering statute, its civil action provision provides: In a civil proceeding under division (A) of this section, any person directly or indirectly injured by conduct in violation of 
section 2923.32 of the Revised Code or a conspiracy to violate that section, other than a violator of that section or a 
conspirator to violate that section, in addition to relief under division (B) of this section, shall have a cause of action for triple 
the actual damages the person sustained. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. § 2923.34 (emphasis added); see also Lowe v. Ransier (In re Nicole Gas Prod.), 581 B.R. 843, 849 
(B.A.P. 6th Cir. 2018) (""[T]he Ohio Legislature intended the OCPA to offer standing to a broader class of plaintiffs than federal 
RICO statutes.""); CSAHA/UHHS-Canton, Inc. v. Aultman Health Found., 2012-Ohio-897, ¶ 74 (Ohio Ct. App. 5th Dist. 2012) 
(""[U]nlike RICO, the Ohio [racketeering statute] specifically permits recovery for all damages directly or indirectly caused by [the 
defendant].""); Iron Workers Local Union No. 17 Ins. Fund v. Philip Morris, Inc., 23 F. Supp. 2d 771, 787 (N.D. Ohio 1998). "
1282,12," Under Count Ten of the Third Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs assert ""[t]his claim is brought by all plaintiffs against Defendants 
Novo Nordisk, Sanofi, and Eli Lilly, and alleges violations of the civil conspiracy laws of the following states: Alabama, Arizona, 
Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, 
Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North 
Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, and Wisconsin."" (ECF No. 
411 ¶ 525.)"
1282,13," The Court determined Plaintiffs' state racketeering claim under Arizona law survives, and therefore, violations of the Arizona 
racketeering statute can serve as a predicate for liability to assert a state-law civil conspiracy claim under Arizona law. "
1283,14," Defendants assert the state-law civil conspiracy claims should be dismissed as improper ""shotgun pleading"" because Plaintiffs 
""cram three dozen claims, each brough under the law of a different state, into a single count."" (ECF No. 422 at 9.) Plaintiffs 
argue their civil conspiracy claims satisfy the notice pleading requirements without needing to separate each state-law civil 
conspiracy claim into different counts. (ECF No. 455 at 12.) Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2) requires pleadings to contain 
""a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief."" A plaintiff is required to plead ""factual 
content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable of the misconduct alleged."" Disc 
Disease Sols. Inc. v. VGH Sols., Inc., 888 F.3d 1256, 1260 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (quoting Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (citing Twombly, 550 
U.S. at 556)). ""Specific facts are not necessary; the statement need only give the defendant fair notice of what the . . . claim is 
and the grounds upon which it rests."" Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 93, 127 S. Ct. 2197, 167 L. Ed. 2d 1081 (2007) (citations 
omitted). Plaintiffs' Third Amended Complaint recounts in nearly 300 pages Defendants' alleged scheme to defraud and 
conspiracy to inflate prices. The Court finds Defendants have fair notice of the claims asserted against them and the grounds 
upon which those claims rest. "

suspensions remained in effect."" (Docket #15-1 a p. 3, citing Exhibit A, 152 Ohio St. 3d at 537.) Further, the NBPA states, ""In his

1333,1," Int'l Constr. Prods., LLC v. Caterpillar, Inc., et al., D. De. Case No. 1:15cv108-RGA-SRF (filed Jan. 29, 2015)."
1333,2," Collectively, the parties filed nearly 200 exhibits containing over 3,700 pages (including dozens of condensed four-page-to-one-
page deposition transcripts), see Attach. to Docs. 355, 356, 357, 376, and more than 200 pages of legal memoranda in support 
of and in opposition to the motions for summary judgment. "
1334,3," Although Plaintiff devotes substantial discussion in its response to events related to the merger between CAS and IronPlanet to 
support its conspiracy claim, the Delaware court unequivocally ruled in October 2019 that ""because ... the merger agreement 
between IronPlanet and [CAS] did not restrain trade, [Plaintiff] cannot rely on the merger agreement to establish concerted 
action."" Doc. 238, at 9."
1334,4," The ""representative brands"" indentified in the agreement were Lonking, Shantui, Sunward, Zoomlion, XCMG, and Mahindra. "
1336,5," The Court did not overlook the Eleventh Circuit statement in De-Long Equip. Co. v. Wash. Mills Abrasive Co., 887 F.2d 1499, 
1515 (11th Cir. 1989), that the court ""must look beyond the defendants' bald denial of concerted action and analyze the 
substance of [plaintiff's] evidence in order to determine if summary judgment was appropriate,"" but the Supreme Court has made 
clear that when faced with sworn testimony denying involvement in the alleged conspiracy, a plaintiff must come forward with 
something more than an assertion that the denials are not credible to withstand summary judgment, see Anderson, 477 U.S. at 
256 (rejecting argument that a plaintiff can defeat a summary judgment motion ""by merely asserting that the jury might, and 
legally could, disbelieve the defendant's denial of a conspiracy""). "
1337,6," Additionally, the statements attributable to Mr. Jeter are hearsay insofar as they are being offered to prove the truth of the 
matter asserted—that IronPlanet terminated its agreement with Plaintiff due to ""pressure"" from Caterpillar and others. The 
statements are not excluded from the definition of hearsay under Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E) because IronPlanet is not alleged to 
be a ""coconspirator"" with Defendants. The statements are not admissible under Fed. R. Evid. 804(b)(3)(A) because Mr. Jeter 
testified in his deposition that he did not recall the substance of his conversion with Mr. Frank, not that he did not recall having a 
conversation at all. See Lamonica v. Safe Hurricane Shutters, Inc., 711 F.3d 1299, 1317 (11th Cir. 2013) (""Rule 804(a)(3) 
applies only if the declarant is unable to remember the 'subject matter,' i.e., if 'he has no memory of the events to which his 
hearsay statements relate.' The fact that the witness does not remember making the statements themselves is irrelevant."" 
(quoting N. Miss. Commc'ns v. Jones, 792 F.2d 1330, 1336 (5th Cir. 1986))). "
1338,7," Conscious parallelism is ""a common reaction of 'firms in a concentrated market that recognize their shared economic interests

Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 509 U.S. 209, 227, 113 S. Ct. 2578, 125 L. Ed. 2d 168 (1993))."
1338,8," Plaintiff argues that ""we"" refers to Ziegler because the signature block on the email identified Mr. Hoeft as the president and 
CEO of Ziegler. However, even when viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, the summary judgment evidence establishes 
that the ""we"" refers to CAS (not Ziegler) because the email was sent in the context of the ongoing merger negotiations between 
CAS and IronPlanet in which Mr. Hoeft was involved in his capacity as a member of CAS's board of director; the substance of 
the ""side note"" closely tracked language proposed by a consultant working for CAS on the merger; and Mr. Hoeft (and Ziegler) 
had no business relationship with IronPlanet other than Mr. Hoeft's involvement in the merger negotiations. "
1342,9," Even if the Court considered Plaintiff's untimely and unauthorized expert declaration (Doc. 376-107), the outcome would be the 
same. The ""plus factors"" discussed in the declaration are (1) motive to conspire, (2) actions against independent self-interest, (3) 
evidence of a traditional conspiracy, and (4) compliance transparency. The discussion of the first factor is unhelpful because, like 
an opportunity to conspire, the fact that defendants have a motive to conspire does not tend to show that they did so. The 
discussion of the second factor is irrelevant because it focuses on actions by IronPlanet that were against its self-interest, not 
actions of the alleged conspirators (i.e., Defendants) that were against their self-interests. The discussion of the third and fourth 
factors is effectively legal argument masquerading as an expert opinion that was fully considered (and rejected) in the Court's 
consideration of the ""plus factors"" identified by Plaintiff in its response in opposition. "
1343,10," It is undisputed that Plaintiff and IronPlanet had a business relationship (first element), and the issue of damages (fourth 
element) was deferred until Phase 2 of the case."
1343,11," Based on this disposition, the Court need not consider Ring Power's alternative argument that any alleged interference would 
have been ""privileged"" because it was a minority owner of IronPlanet. See Bridge Fin., Inc. v. J. Fischer & Assocs., Inc., 310 So. 
3d 45, 50 (Fla. 4th DCA 2020) (holding that ""because [the defendant] was a partial [5%] owner in [the plaintiff], he was not a 
stranger to a business relationship, and thus cannot be held liable for tortious interference""). Likewise, the Court need not 
consider Plaintiff's argument that Ring Power should not be allowed to assert this privilege defense now because it did not raise 
it in its answer. "
1351,1," nn1 Defendants' requests to strike Plonsker's declarations under Federal Rule of Evidence 702, Dkt. Nos. 135, 266, are denied 
without prejudice to possible consideration down the road. HN4[
] A ""trial court may give even inadmissible evidence some 
weight"" in a preliminary injunction analysis. Flynt Distributing Co., Inc. v. Harvey, 734 F.2d 1389, 1394 (9th Cir. 1984); see also 
Johnson v. Couturier, 572 F.3d 1067, 1083 (9th Cir. 2009). The Court considered the Plonsker declaration at Dkt. No. 19-2 for 
the specific question of standing, but did not rely on any of Plonsker's declarations for the analysis of the preliminary injunction 
factors. "
1353,2," nn2 Because plaintiffs' merits showing is lacking, the Court need not resolve defendants' other ""likelihood of success"" 
arguments, such as antitrust standing or personal jurisdiction. Dkt. No. 133 at 6-7, 9-10. Those issues will be addressed as 
warranted at a later stage of the case. "
1354,3," nn3 Defendants' objection to new reply evidence, Dkt. No. 292, is terminated as moot. The evidence objected to played no role 
in this order. "
1363,1," Plaintiffs do not allege that Defendants violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act. The elements of a claim under Section 2 of the 
Sherman Act are: ""(1) proof of a concerted action deliberately entered into with the specific intent to achieve an unlawful 
monopoly, and (2) the commission of an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy."" Int'l Distrib. Ctrs., Inc. v. Walsh Trucking Co., 
812 F.2d 786, 795 (2d Cir. 1987) (internal quotation marks omitted). ""A Section 1 violation is legally distinct from that under 
[Section] 2."" Sitts v. Dairy Farmers of Am., Inc., 417 F. Supp. 3d 433, 464 (D. Vt. 2019) (quoting United States v. Socony-

1364,2," ""Restraints imposed by agreement between competitors have traditionally been denominated as horizontal restraints, and 
those imposed by agreement between firms at different levels of distribution as vertical restraints."" Bus. Elecs. Corp. v. Sharp 
Elecs. Corp., 485 U.S. 717, 730, 108 S. Ct. 1515, 99 L. Ed. 2d 808 (1988). "
1365,3," To the extent Plaintiffs argue that they sufficiently pleaded an antitrust injury by relying on the ""essential facilities"" doctrine, 
Opp'n at 6, the Court does not need to consider this argument."
1365,4," Defendant Gural, on the other hand, is a direct competitor. Compl. ¶ 83. As for American Racing, it is unclear from the 
Complaint what role American Racing plays in the harness racing market, but the Court will assume for now that it too is a 
market participant. "
1366,5," In a footnote, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have alleged a two-sided market (horse owners and racing fans), and that 
Plaintiffs cannot establish antitrust injury because they ""have only alleged harm to themselves and have not considered net 
harms to the two-sided market considered as a whole."" Defs.' Sur-Reply at 4 n.3. The Court disagrees for several reasons. First, 
the argument was made in a footnote and was not properly placed before the Court. See Young America's Foundation v. 
Stenger, No. 20-CV-0822, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 159439, 2021 WL 3738005, at *15 (N.D.N.Y. Aug. 24, 2021) (Kahn, J.). 
Second, the Court is not convinced that Plaintiffs have alleged a two-sided market. Although the racetracks connect the market 
of horse fans to the market of horse owners, the network effects based on the Complaint's allegations run mainly in one 
direction: ""the more owners who race their horses at these racetracks, the more competitive the races are and the more 
attractive the races are to the public."" Compl. ¶ 53. The Complaint provides no allegations regarding why the horse owners 
would care how many racing fans there are. Third, Defendants rely upon Ohio v. Am. Express Co., 138 S. Ct. 2274, 2280, 201 L. 
Ed. 2d 678 (2018) for their two-sided market standing argument, but as the Second Circuit recently held: ""Importantly, American 
Express did not directly address antitrust standing at all."" Salveson v. JPMorgan Chase & Co., 860 F. App'x 207, 209 (2d Cir. 
2021)."
1366,6," The Court notes that district courts within the Second Circuit have not been consistent with regard to the step of the Gatt 
analysis in which a court should consider whether a plaintiff plausibly plead an injury to competition. See, e.g., Sell It Soc., LLC 
v. Acumen Brands, Inc., No. 14-CV-3491, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 35404, 2015 WL 1345927, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 20, 2015) 
(considering it mainly at Step 1), Arcesium, LLC v. Advent Software, Inc., No. 20-CV-4389, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 62957, 2021 
WL 1225446, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 31, 2021) (considering it at Step 2). In some cases, courts still consider whether a plaintiff 
plausibly alleges an antitrust injury even if they do not explicitly follow the Gatt three-step process. See, e.g., Bhanusali v. 
Orange Reg'l Med. Ctr., No. 10-CV-6694 CS, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 113974, 2013 WL 4828657, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 12, 2013), 
aff'd in part, vacated in part, 572 F. App'x 62 (2d Cir. 2014), Ramnarine v. Nationstar Mortg., LLC, No. 19-CV-5544, 2019 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 219328, 2019 WL 7038430, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. Dec. 20, 2019). "
1368,7," ""[C]ourts have long recognized the existence of 'hub-and-spoke' conspiracies in which an entity at one level of the market 
structure, the 'hub,' coordinates an agreement among competitors at a different level, the 'spokes.'"" United States v. Apple, 
Inc., 791 F.3d 290, 314 (2d Cir. 2015) (quoting Howard Hess Dental Labs. Inc. v. Dentsply Int'l, Inc., 602 F.3d 237, 255 (3d Cir. 
2010)). ""Existing case law makes clear that a hub-and-spoke theory is cognizable under Section 1 only if there are both vertical 
agreements between the hub and each spoke, and also a horizontal agreement among the various spokes with each other."" In 
re Zinc Antitrust Litig., 155 F. Supp. 3d 337, 376 (S.D.N.Y. 2016) (citing Apple, 791 F.3d at 314). The per se rule can apply to 
""hub-and-spoke"" conspiracies. See Preston Hollow Cap. LLC v. Nuveen LLC, No. 20-CV-5597, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 150031, 
2021 WL 3542255, at *14 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 10, 2021). Although Plaintiffs do not explicitly refer to a ""hub-and-spoke"" conspiracy in 
the Complaint, the Court may determine at a later time that Gural acted as a ""hub"" and racetrack defendants as ""spokes."""
1368,8," Although Chapman dealt with Section 2 of the Sherman Act, other courts in this Circuit have applied Chapman's rationale to

Wellbutrin XL, 133 F. Supp. 3d at 745. Not only did the parties sign one settlement agreement (made up of various agreements, 
including ""the Omnibus Agreement""), one generic took the lead initially in negotiating on behalf of all generic manufacturers. Id. 
This is not what Value Drug alleges today. Value Drug alleges separate settlement agreements between Takeda and Par, 
Takeda and Watson, and Takeda and Amneal. Value Drug does not allege together these constituted a global settlement 
agreement, like in In re Wellbutrin, nor does it allege either Par, Watson, or Amneal negotiated on behalf of all of them 
collectively. Similarly, in United Food & Com. Workers Loc. 1776, the plaintiffs argued ""the Settlement Agreement, signed by all 
three defendants, satisfies the 'contract, combination, or conspiracy' elements"" of their antitrust claims. 296 F. Supp. 3d at 1165 
(emphasis added). Judge Orrick observed ""Defendants do not dispute this, although they do dispute the significance, 
lawfulness, and effect of the various provisions in that Agreement"" and therefore granted judgment in favor of plaintiff on the 
conspiracy element of its claims. Id. (emphasis added). We do not have all defendants signing one settlement agreement here. 
We have individual settlement agreements between Takeda and each generic manufacturer. Nor do the defendants here 
concede the settlement agreements satisfy the conspiracy claim. Neither of these cases provides teeth to Value Drug's

Food & Com. Workers Loc. 1776 & Participating Emps. Health & Welfare Fund v. Teikoku Pharma USA, 296 F. Supp. 3d 1142 
(N.D. Cal. 2017). In In re Wellbutrin, the ""Wellbutrin Settlement was executed on February 9, 2007"" resolving various pending 
lawsuits between the brand drug and various generic manufacturers and ""was comprised of multiple agreements."" In re 
Wellbutrin XL, 133 F. Supp. 3d at 745. Not only did the parties sign one settlement agreement (made up of various agreements, 
including ""the Omnibus Agreement""), one generic took the lead initially in negotiating on behalf of all generic manufacturers. Id. 
This is not what Value Drug alleges today. Value Drug alleges separate settlement agreements between Takeda and Par, 
Takeda and Watson, and Takeda and Amneal. Value Drug does not allege together these constituted a global settlement 
agreement, like in In re Wellbutrin, nor does it allege either Par, Watson, or Amneal negotiated on behalf of all of them 
collectively. Similarly, in United Food & Com. Workers Loc. 1776, the plaintiffs argued ""the Settlement Agreement, signed by all 
three defendants, satisfies the 'contract, combination, or conspiracy' elements"" of their antitrust claims. 296 F. Supp. 3d at 1165 
(emphasis added). Judge Orrick observed ""Defendants do not dispute this, although they do dispute the significance, 
lawfulness, and effect of the various provisions in that Agreement"" and therefore granted judgment in favor of plaintiff on the 
conspiracy element of its claims. Id. (emphasis added). We do not have all defendants signing one settlement agreement here. 
We have individual settlement agreements between Takeda and each generic manufacturer. Nor do the defendants here 
concede the settlement agreements satisfy the conspiracy claim. Neither of these cases provides teeth to Value Drug's 
misplaced argument. "

2011 WL 10525397, at *2-3 (Pa. Com. Pl. May 3, 2011). The case is inapposite. It does not address successor liability, nor does 
it involve a claim from a plaintiff trying to establish liability over a defendant under a successor theory. Rather, the case involved 
the sellers of a company suing the purchaser seeking a preliminary injunction to enjoin the purchaser from using certain disputed 
funds transferred during the sale. 2011 Phila. Ct. Com. Pl. LEXIS 107, [WL] at *1-2. In Eagle National Bank, the sellers 
transferred their assets to the purchaser, ""including reserve deposits held for the benefit of the branch offices."" 2011 Phila. Ct. 
Com. Pl. LEXIS 107, [WL] at *2. Certain branches disclaimed affiliation with the purchaser and requested the sellers release any 
funds in the reserve deposits. Id. The sellers forwarded the request to release the funds to the purchaser—who then owned the 
reserve deposits. Id. The purchaser disclaimed it had to pay the branches the deposits. Id. The sellers sought a preliminary 
injunction to stop the purchaser from using the money in dispute, which the sellers transferred to the purchaser during the sale 
and the sellers argued the purchaser agreed to pay in the purchase agreement when it assumed certain liabilities. Id. Judge 
Bernstein issued the preliminary injunction finding the elements satisfied. 2011 Phila. Ct. Com. Pl. LEXIS 107, [WL] at *5. The

(S.D.N.Y. Oct. 20, 2015). The caption also lists Rabobank International, but that is merely a tradename for Rabobank. "
1440,3," Specifically, we dismissed the appeals of the following parties pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 42(b): (1) 
Plaintiffs Ellen Gelboim and Linda Zacher's appeal with respect to Citibank, NA and Citigroup, Inc. (Doc. No. 821); (2) Gelboim 
and Zacher's appeal with respect to J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., J. P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., Bank of America Corporation, 
and Bank of America N.A. (Doc. Nos. 817, 815); (3) Gelboim and Zacher's appeal with respect to Royal Bank of Scotland (Doc. 
Nos. 819), and (4) the Exchange-Based Plaintiffs Metzler Asset Management GmbH (f/k/a Metzler Investment GMBH), FTC 
Futures Fund SICAV, FTC Futures Fund PCC Ltd., Atlantic Trading USA, LLC, 303030 Trading LLC, Gary Francis, and 
Nathaniel Haynes's appeal with respect to Société Générale S.A. (Doc. Nos. 784). We later dismissed HSBC Holdings plc and 
HSBC Bank plc from one of the Schwab cases. (Doc. No. 838) Most recently, Gelboim and Zacher moved to sever and stay 
their appeal as to Credit Suisse, The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd. (now known as MUFG Bank, Ltd.), and Norinchukin 
Bank, which we granted on October 19, 2021; accordingly, this opinion does not resolve any legal issues between those parties. "
1441,4," Even though the district court dismissed Schwab's claims for lack of personal jurisdiction and did not reach Defendants' motion 
to dismiss Schwab's claims for lack of antitrust standing, we are free to consider that issue on appeal as an alternate basis to 
affirm the dismissal of Schwab's claims. See Daniel v. Am. Bd. of Emergency Med., 428 F.3d 408, 421 (2d Cir. 2005)."
1441,5," HN3[
] Of course, an antitrust plaintiff must show both constitutional standing and antitrust standing. See AGC, 459 U.S. at"
1441,535," n.31; Port Dock & Stone Corp. v. Oldcastle Ne., Inc., 507 F.3d 117, 121 (2d Cir. 2007). But we have already held that 
constitutional standing is ""easily satisfied by [A]ppellants' pleading that they were harmed by receiving lower returns on LIBOR-
denominated instruments as a result of [D]efendants' manipulation of LIBOR."" Gelboim, 823 F.3d at 770. "
1444,6," Indeed, Schwab's argument is even more tenuous in some respects, since Schwab bases its federal antitrust claim not only on 
LIBOR-indexed bonds purchased from third parties, but also on fixed-rate bonds that do not reference LIBOR at all. Schwab's 
theory is that LIBOR exerted a kind of gravitational force, influencing fixed-rate bonds. But that is clearly insufficient to establish 
antitrust standing. "
1445,7," Having resolved the antitrust-standing issue in favor of Defendants, we do not reach their alternative argument that Schwab 
and the Bondholder Plaintiffs have not pleaded an antitrust injury related to bonds purchased before the suppression period. "
1447,8," Although Defendants state for the first time in their sur-reply that Plaintiffs failed to satisfy the first two Schwab factors, we 
consider this delayed argument to be forfeited. See McBride v. BIC Consumer Prods. Mfg. Co., 583 F.3d 92, 96 (2d Cir. 2009) 
(""[W]e ordinarily will not consider issues raised for the first time in a reply brief.""); 16AA Charles A. Wright & Arthur R. Miller, 
Federal Practice & Procedure § 3974.2 (5th ed.) (""An appellee who fails to include and properly argue a contention in the 
appellee's brief takes the risk that the court will view the contention as forfeited.""). Indeed, even after Plaintiffs' opening brief 
articulated essentially the same conspiracy-based jurisdictional test later adopted in Schwab and relied on Gelboim as 
""confirm[ing] that the first and second elements are met,"" Appellants' Jurisdiction Br. at 59, Defendants' 73-page response brief 
on personal jurisdiction did not hint at any disagreement on that score. Under these circumstances, no ""manifest injustice"" would 
result from following our ordinary course and declining to consider Defendants' belated argument. JP Morgan Chase Bank v. 
Altos Hornos de Mexico, S.A. de C.V., 412 F.3d 418, 428 (2d Cir. 2005). "
1448,9," In light of this conclusion, we do not address whether other alleged acts, including that the BBA sent a representative to the 
United States to assure investors that LIBOR was sound and that LIBOR submissions were transmitted to Thomson Reuters in 
New York, also amount to overt conspiratorial acts in the forum. "
1449,10," Having resolved the specific personal jurisdiction issue in favor of the Plaintiffs, we do not reach Plaintiffs' alternative 
arguments that Defendants established minimum contacts with the United States by (1) selling trillions of dollars of LIBOR-based 
instruments in the United States, Appellants' Jurisdiction Br. at 40-42; (2) exploiting U.S. markets for USD-LIBOR-based financial 
products, id. at 42-44; and (3) targeting the United States with their price-fixing conspiracy, id. at 42-46. "
1453,1," The Court may take judicial notice of these public judicial opinions and records. Fed. R. Evid. 201; Stutzka v. McCarville, 420 
F.3d 757, 760 n.2 (8th Cir. 2005)."
1453,2," Paragraph 17 of the affidavit Josephs filed in support of her damages indicates that the Defendants are liable for $5,128.43 in 
2019 credit card expenses not reflected in the $47,000 promissory note. (Josephs Decl. ¶ 17.) As Exhibit B shows $5,128.45 
and all calculations based on these expenses in Josephs's filings arrive at a sum using $5,128.45, the Court will use $5,128.45 
for these expenses. "
1454,3," In her supplemental brief and in the supporting affidavit from Matthew Forsgren, Josephs asserts that she has incurred 
$58,584.50 in fees and costs prosecuting this case through October 31, 2021. (2nd Mem. Supp. Mot. Default J at 15; 2nd 
Forsgren Decl. ¶ 13.) The sum of the fees and expenses documented in Exhibit 3 of the Forsgren affidavit is $51,975.50. (2nd 
Forsgren Decl. Ex. 3.) When added to the $6,309 in fees and expenses incurred in October 2021 (Id. ¶ 12), the documentation 
shows that Josephs has incurred $58,284.50 in fees and expenses. Therefore, the Court will use the $58,284.50 amount 
substantiated in the record. "
1455,4," The Complaint also alleges a promissory estoppel claim (Count IV) in the alternative to the breach of contract claim. Because 
the Court concludes that the Complaint satisfies the requirements for breach of contract and the damages Josephs suffered "
1456,," under the promissory estoppel claim are identical to those as the breach of contract claim, the promissory estoppel claim is moot 
as an alternative theory of recovery. "
1457,5," Josephs does not seek to recover costs and attorneys from PMG because PMG is not included in the RICO or abuse of 
process claims and, unlike Marzan's personal guaranty, the promissory notes did not include a provision allowing Josephs to 
recover expenses incurred enforcing the notes. Therefore, these damages are not awarded against PMG. "
1458,6," Other circuits have addressed but left unresolved whether equitable relief is available to private plaintiffs again. The First and 
Third Circuits have noted the split but expressed no opinion on the issue. See Lincoln House, Inc. v. Dupre, 903 F.2d 845, 848 
(1st Cir. 1990); Northeast Women's Ctr., Inc. v. McMonagle, 868 F.2d 1342, 1355 (3d Cir. 1989). The Fourth and Fifth Circuits 
have expressed doubt that equitable relief is available to private plaintiffs. See Johnson v. Collins Ent. Co., 199 F.3d 710, 726 
(4th Cir. 1999); In re Fredeman Litig., 843 F.2d 821, 829-30 (5th Cir. 1988) "
1459,7," On rehearing en banc of Bennett, one member of the en banc court would have found that equitable relief is available to private 
plaintiffs. Bennett v. Berg, 710 F.2d 1361, 1365 (8th Cir. 1983) (en banc) (McMillan, J. concurring in part and dissenting in part). 
The rest of the en banc court did not address the issue. "
1464,8," This provision protects the rights of innocent persons and entities involved with PMG and Jupiter Rising Film under 18 U.S.C. § 
1964(a)."
1464,9," The Court will not require Marzan to directly disclose his charge of Theft By Swindle in Minnesota State Court Case Number 
82-CR-14-2262 as it was continued for dismissal. See Sentencing Order, State of Minnesota v. Alberto Jose Marzan, Case No. 
82-CR-14-2262 (Minn. Dist. Ct. Aug. 20, 2018). The facts of the case will still be available to those receiving disclosures 
because the Complaint in this case must be provided."
1464,10," Marzan need not disclose the supplemental briefing and documentation Josephs provided at the Court's request. To be clear, 
in addition to the Complaint and this Order, Marzan must disclose Docket Numbers 10, 12, and 13 including all exhibits attached 
to Docket Number 13. "
1467,*," We have agreed to decide the case without oral argument because the briefs and record adequately present the facts and legal 
arguments, and oral argument would not significantly aid the court. FED. R. APP. P. 34(a)(2)(C). "
1472,1," The agreements and Guidelines are ""central"" to Plaintiff's claims, and are incorporated by reference in the FAC. United States 
v. Ritchie, 342 F.3d 903, 908 (9th Cir. 2003). "
1475,2," Plaintiff's opposition brief does not dispute Apple's argument that Plaintiff failed to allege the relevant market as an aftermarket. 
Indeed, the word ""aftermarket"" does not appear in Plaintiff's complaint nor in its opposition brief. Nonetheless, setting aside 
Plaintiff's failure to clearly articulate its intention to propose a single-brand aftermarket, the allegations in the complaint do not 
suffice to plausibly allege a single-brand aftermarket under Ninth Circuit precedent. Under Newcal, to plausibly assert a single-
brand aftermarket at the pleading stage, a Plaintiff is required to adequately allege that (1) the aftermarket is wholly derivative 
from the primary market, (2) the illegal restraints of trade relate only to the aftermarket, (3) the defendant did not achieve market 
power in the aftermarket through contractual provisions that it obtains in the initial market, and (4) competition in the initial 
market does not suffice to discipline anticompetitive practices in the aftermarket. 513 F.3d at 1048-50. At most, Plaintiff's 
complaint gestures at fourth factor. See Compl. ¶¶ 32-34. But even these statements amount to conclusory assertions and 
formulaic recitations of the element, devoid of specific factual allegations to satisfy Rule 12(b)(6). Levitt, 765 F.3d at 1135. "
1478,3," Plaintiff's relevant market definition and theory of antitrust injury also fail to apprehend or analyze the two-sided nature of the 
marketplace of transactions for apps where Apple's App Store functions as an intermediary between the respective sides — app 
developers and end users. See Coronavirus Reporter, 2021 WL 5936910, at *12-15. Although Apple does not advance this 
argument in the pending motion, should Plaintiff seek to amend his complaint to plausibly state a claim, Plaintiff must allege a 
relevant market and theory of antitrust injury that addresses the two-sided nature of the relevant market. See id. "

on November 17, 2020 and removed from the Board on December 11 at another EGM called by Shkreli. "
1562,35," The Plaintiffs proved at trial that separate provisions in Vyera's contracts with Distributors were intended to impede the entry of 
generic drug companies into the FDA-approved pyrimethamine market by depriving those companies of accurate information 
about Daraprim sales. Through these data-blocking provisions, Distributors agreed not to provide Daraprim sales data to data 
aggregators such as IQVIA, Symphony Health, and Wolters Kluwer. Because the absence of this normally available market data 
did not impede the entry of either Cerovene or Fera, the data-blocking scheme need not be further described. The Cerovene and 
Fera experiences are central to the calculation of the disgorgement the State Plaintiffs seek. "
1564,36," Although Shkreli made no developed argument regarding this third alternative treatment, Shkreli suggests that atovaquone 
was another therapeutic alternative to Daraprim for the treatment of toxoplasmosis. Atovaquone is an FDA-approved 
antimicrobial drug for treatment of PCP and is prescribed for patients who cannot tolerate TMP-SMX. The Guidelines give 
atovaquone a C-III grade for primary prophylaxis of toxoplasmosis and a B-II grade as an alternative treatment for active 
toxoplasma encephalitis. Shkreli has not shown that atovaquone was either therapeutically or economically substitutable with 
Daraprim. "

generic pyrimethamine, and the Vyera AG tablet for a sustained period after Dr. Reddy's generic pyrimethamine entered the 
market. The real-world evidence of Daraprim's price, volume, and market share after Dr. Reddy's entry in March 2020 starkly 
demonstrates not only that Vyera had a monopoly over Daraprim, but also that the high price maintained in that monopoly 
depended entirely on the absence of competition. "

1644,6," The Ninth Circuit has held where the defendant is not itself a competitor of the plaintiff, but the plaintiff's claims are based on

1645,7," In an earlier case, Judge Alsup held that a plaintiff's claim under the unlawful prong of the UCL necessarily raised a federal

the Court will apply the indirect purchaser rule to the Florida Antitrust Act. "
1659,5," Courts look to the federal antitrust laws when evaluating claims brought under the Florida Antitrust Act. See All Care Nursing 
Serv., Inc. v. High Tech Staffing Servs., Inc., 135 F.3d 740, 745 n.11 (11th Cir. 1998) (""Federal and Florida antitrust laws are 
analyzed under the same rules and case law.""). "
1660,6," Moreover, these rebate negotiations are a core component of the City's alleged conspiracy. The City argues that these rebates 
are kickbacks in exchange for preferential formulary placement. (ECF No. 70 at 25); cf. Feaz v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 745 
F.3d 1098, 1111 (11th Cir. 2014) (""The defining characteristic of a kickback is divided loyalties."") (quoting Cohen v. Am. Sec. 
Ins. Co., 735 F.3d 601, 611 (7th Cir. 2013)). A kickback is still illegal even if firms agree to individually bid for it. "
1661,7," In a bullet-point list in its response, the City identifies several additional plus factors. (ECF No. 70 at 27-29.) As the City does 
not tie these plus factors to allegations in the amended complaint, it is unclear whether the City is contending that each of these 
factors apply in this case. This ambiguity is heightened as several of these plus factors are merely generalized statements of "
1662,," legal principles, not all of which are applicable at this stage. Nonetheless, the Court holds that the plus factors identified above 
are sufficient to suggest a plausible agreement at the motion-to-dismiss stage."
1662,8," The Defendants argue that federal law prohibits including rebates in a list price for pharmaceutical products. (ECF No. 60 at 23 
(discussing 42 U.S.C. § 1395w-3a(c)(6)(B) (in relevant part, defining ""wholesale acquisition cost"" of a pharmaceutical product as 
""not including prompt pay or other discounts, rebates or reductions in price"")).) However, the City's claim is that the Manufacturer 
Defendants inflated the price of insulin and other medications through the use of fraudulent rebates that served as kickbacks to 
the PBM Defendants. The Manufacturer Defendants cannot use Section 1395w-3a(c)(6)(B) to avoid the City's allegations of 
wrongdoing. "
1690,1," Defendants do not claim that a ruling in their favor on the Illinois Brick argument makes a ruling on their other damages 
arguments unnecessary. The Court assumes that it does not; at a minimum, there are still state-law antitrust claims pending that 
may proceed on an indirect damages theory. See [507] at 26 (""many states expressly have rejected Illinois Brick's bar on indirect 
purchaser claims by enacting 'repealer statutes' abrogating the Supreme Court's prohibition on indirect-purchaser actions as 
articulated in Illinois Brick"" (quoting In re Dairy Farmers of Am., Inc. Cheese Antitrust Litigation, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 84152,

1722,30," And as for any claim for injunctive relief, none of the cases cited by George & Co. in opposition to the motion to dismiss 
address section 1114(1)(b). Nor do they allege that Target is a printer which would fall within that subsection. The Court can, 
therefore, only conclude George & Co. is not seeking an injunction on the basis of section 32(1)(b)."
1722,31," Target argues George & Co. has not demonstrated ownership of the common law marks or unregistered marks the Amended 
Complaint makes brief reference to. Target Suppl. at 4-5; Mot. to Dismiss at 6; Am. Compl. ¶ 18. The argument is irrelevant. 
George & Co.'s claims are based on the LCR Marks, Am. Compl. ¶¶ 40-55, which are registered. "
1724,32," Target could have reasonably argued that there is no connection between several of the LCR Marks, some of which are visual 
images and others which are phrases containing ""LCR,"" and Target's alleged use—depicted in the photographs appended to the 
Amended Complaint, which only show Target using the label ""LCR""—and such marks should be dismissed from the suit. But it 
did not. "
1725,33," While in its brief it outlines the elements of collateral estoppel, Mot. to Dismiss at 8; Target Suppl. at 2, Target makes no 
mention of the non-mutuality, and engages in a cursory analysis of the elements of estoppel. "
1727,34," Indeed ""[e]ach of the cases cited by"" Target—in both of its briefs for these arguments—""was decided not on a motion to 
dismiss, but on a motion for summary judgment or after trial based on a complete factual record,"" Kaplan, Inc. v. Yun, 16 F. 
Supp. 3d 341, 348 (S.D.N.Y. 2014), or on a preliminary injunction. See Mot. to Dismiss at 5-6, 8-9; Target Suppl. at 3-4. "
1729,35," One common exception is the securities laws, where a plaintiff must plead facts that the inference of knowing misconduct, 
scienter, is at least as strong as the innocent explanation. Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rts., Ltd., 551 U.S. 308, 324, 127 S. 
Ct. 2499, 168 L. Ed. 2d 179 (2007) (""A complaint will survive . . . only if a reasonable person would deem the inference of 
scienter cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference one could draw from the facts alleged.""). But that 
exception exists by force of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, not the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. No similar 
provision exists in the Lanham Act. "
1730,36," Target's repeated argument that the Amended Complaint fails to allege how it used the trademarks is simply without merit. 
Mot. to Dismiss at 11. The Amended Complaint may group Target with other unidentified defendants—an issue discussed 
below—but the photographs and the factual allegations about the relationship between George & Co. and Target detail Target's 
conduct (and use of the LCR Marks)."
1730,37," Nor do any of these cases stand for the proposition that such use could not constitute use in commerce. Target turns cases 
where a complaint has been found deficient into ones holding that as a matter of law, certain conduct is either innocent or cannot 
amount to infringement. But they quite clearly do not say such things. "
1731,38," Fischer v. Forrest is of little assistance to Target's argument. There, the counterfeiting claim failed because the plaintiff's mark 
was easily distinguished from defendant's mark. No. 14 Civ. 1304, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 40597, 2017 WL 1063464, at *4 
(S.D.N.Y. Mar. 21, 2017) (adopting report and recommendation) (affirming determination that phrases ""Bee-Quick"" and ""Natural 
Honey Harvester"" are ""far from identical or substantially indistinguishable""). Again, George & Co. is alleging that Target engaged 
in counterfeiting by selling goods, made by a different manufacturer, which used the actual LCR Marks."
1731,39," This admission contradicts Target's later argument in the supplemental papers that George & Co. does not identify the game. 
Target Suppl. at 2. "
1732,40," A defendant could presumably also move to dismiss a John Doe defendant on the grounds that the allegations against him 
failed to state a claim; here those arguments are the same raised by Target on its own behalf. And as noted, they failed to 
warrant dismissal of the infringement claim."
1732,41," None of the cases cited by Target addresses the group pleading barrier in the context of the John Doe defendants. The notice 
problem attendant to group pleading when defendants are present is different from cases where they are unnamed and 
unknown, since in the former case parties are being forced to defend against a suit without knowledge or understanding of the 
specific allegation against them. And here, there may be a time where that is also the case, but it would be inconsistent with the 
liberal standard for amendment to preclude George & Co. from being given the opportunity to identify the John Does and 
differentiating their conduct. "
1735,1," Plaintiff Amy Hill, also included in the FAC, was voluntarily dismissed from this action on February 8, 2020. (ECF No. 21.) "
1736,2," Plaintiffs define this industry standard, adopted by the American Society for Testing Materials (""ASTM""), at length in the PSAC. 
(ECF No. 36-1 ¶¶ 83-88.) "
1737,3," Even if the Court's Order were construed to be a final judgment, Rule 15(a) would still govern Plaintiffs' motion. A court 
considering a post-judgment motion to amend a complaint ""need not concern itself with [Rule 60(b)'s] legal standards."" Katyle v. 
Penn Nat. Gaming, Inc., 637 F.3d 462, 471 (4th Cir. 2011). Instead, ""[t]he court need only ask whether the amendment should 
be granted, just as it would on a prejudgment motion to amend pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a),"" i.e. ""for prejudice, bad faith, or 
futility."" Id. "
1740,4," While Plaintiffs' FAC included class members who purchased either bedding or linens, (ECF No. 15 ¶ 98), Plaintiffs appear in 
their PSAC to limit the classes to customers who purchased bedding sheets, (ECF No. 36-1 ¶ 115). "
1742,5," The parties dispute which state's law governs Plaintiffs' implied warranty claims. (ECF Nos. 19 at 8-9; 24 at 5-7; 25 at 2-4.) 
However, neither party has identified an actual conflict of laws in this case. (See ECF Nos. 24 at 7-11 (arguing that Plaintiffs 
stated a claim under the UCC as adopted by each state); 25 at 4 (""Plaintiffs' breach-of-warranty claims must be dismissed 
regardless of which state's law applies."")). Thus, the Court need not reach the choice of law issue at this stage. "
1746,6," Defendants cite Sebago, Inc. v. Beazer E., Inc., 18 F. Supp. 2d 70 (D. Mass. 1998), which applied the economic loss rule to a 
negligent misrepresentation claim after finding in 1998 that ""Massachusetts has not expressly decided whether the economic 
loss doctrine bars claims of negligent misrepresentation where the damages result from a defective product."" Id. at 95. State 
courts have since repeated that negligent misrepresentation is categorically excepted from the economic loss rule, see 
Passatempo, 960 N.E.2d at 294, and the U.S. District Court in Massachusetts has allowed negligent misrepresentation claims 
related to defective products to proceed, Softub, 53 F. Supp. 3d at 260. "
1747,7," Plaintiffs do not argue that the untimeliness of Plaintiffs Chiaraluce's and Fontaine's demands have been cured by their PSAC, 
nor does the Court find that this amended complaint cures the defects. Plaintiffs had ample time between January 5, 2020—
thirty days after Chiaraluce and Fontaine mailed their letter—and this Court's Order on March 17, 2021, to amend their complaint 
to cure this defect but failed to do so. After Plaintiffs' suit was dismissed by the Court, Defendants no longer had incentive to "
1748,," respond to the demand letter and settle the suit. Thus, the purposes of the demand requirement, including to encourage 
settlement and limit damages, are not served by allowing Plaintiffs to reassert their MCPA claims in their PSAC. "

documents with the Louisiana Secretary of State on November 10, 2021. Id. at 3 (citing R. Doc. 17-2). So, NOAC raises the 
issue whether an entity that was created after an action was filed may have standing to sue as the sole plaintiff. This raises an 
additional issue whether the injuries of ACGTC's members are ""fairly traceable."" HN1[
] A plaintiff bears the burden of 
establishing standing as of the time suit was brought. Carney v. Adams, 141 S. Ct. 493, 499, 208 L. Ed. 2d 305 (2020) (citing 
Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561, 112 S. Ct. 2130, 119 L. Ed. 2d 351 (1992) (plaintiff bears the burden of proving

610 (2000) (standing is assessed ""at the time the action commences"")). The constitutional requirement of standing is three-
pronged: the plaintiff must have ""(1) suffered an injury in fact, (2) that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the 
defendant, and (3) that is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision."" Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 578 U.S. 330, 338, 136 
S. Ct. 1540, 194 L. Ed. 2d 635 (2016) (citing Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560-61). The same requirements apply to an entity seeking to 
establish associational standing, which is ""derivative of the standing of the association's members, requiring that they have 
standing and that the interests the association seeks to protect be germane to its purpose."" OCA-Greater Hous. v. Texas, 867 
F.3d 604, 609-10 (5th Cir. 2017). It is unclear from the complaint whether the complained-of conduct is the 2020 cemetery

1760,61," In addition to the concerns discussed above, supra note 43, Defendants' motion to dismiss raises other questions the Court 
does not now answer but which ACGTC may want to address in its second amended complaint. Defendants contend that 
ACGTC has failed to establish antitrust standing. Standing to bring an antitrust claim requires a plaintiff to show: (1) ""injury-in-
fact, an injury to the plaintiff proximately caused by the defendants' conduct""; (2) antitrust injury; and (3) ""proper plaintiff status, 
which assures that other parties are not better situated to bring suit."" Doctor's Hosp. of Jefferson, Inc. v. Se. Med. All., Inc., 123 
F.3d 301, 305 (5th Cir. 1997). Antitrust injury is ""injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flows from 
that which makes defendants' act unlawful. The injury should reflect the anticompetitive [*18]  effect either of the violation or of 
anticompetitive acts made possible by the violation."" Id. (quoting Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 U.S. 477, 
489, 97 S. Ct. 690, 50 L. Ed. 2d 701 (1977)). The ""proper plaintiff"" inquiry considers ""(1) whether the plaintiff's injuries or their 
causal link to the defendant are speculative, (2) whether other parties have been more directly harmed, and (3) whether allowing 
this plaintiff to sue would risk multiple lawsuits, duplicative recoveries, or complex damage apportionment."" McCormack v. Nat'l 
Collegiate Athletic Ass'n, 845 F.2d 1338, 1341 (5th Cir. 1988). ACGTC should ensure that its second amended complaint 
satisfies the requisites for antitrust standing. Defendants also argue that ACGTC has failed to allege key elements of its antitrust claims. For example, Defendants highlight 
ACGTC's failure to define the relevant product and geographic market. ACGTC should ensure that its second amended 
complaint addresses these additional concerns. "

1761,63," HN10[
] Rule 15 allows a court to grant leave to amend ""when justice so requires."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2). The Fifth Circuit has recognized that ""[i]n view of the consequences of dismissal on the complaint alone, and the pull to decide cases on the 
merits rather than on the sufficiency of the pleadings, district courts often afford plaintiffs at least one opportunity to cure 
pleading deficiencies before dismissing a case, unless it is clear that the defects are incurable or the plaintiffs advise the court 
that they are unwilling or unable to amend in a manner that will avoid dismissal."" Great Plains Tr. Co. v. Morgan Stanley Dean 
Witter & Co., 313 F.3d 305, 329 (5th Cir. 2002). "
1763,1," Defendants renewed their joint motion to dismiss in light of the superseding indictment. ECF No. 83. They stated that because 
the superseding indictment's allegations regarding Count 3 ""are substantially the same as the allegations in support of Counts 1 
and 2,"" therefore Count 3 ""fails as a matter of law for the same reasons that Counts 1 and 2 fail."" Id. at p. 2. This opinion will 
therefore cite primarily to the briefing regarding dismissal of the original indictment. "
1779,1," For the purposes of Novartis and Vetter's motions to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), the Court takes the facts in Regeneron's 
complaint as true. The Court notes that in addition to the redacted First Amended Complaint on the docket, Regeneron has also 
filed a ""clean"" version of that document under seal. The Court has consulted the clean version where necessary but will cite to 
the official version. "
1781,2," The Court refers to the complaint in the '631 Patent case solely to provide context to the parties' disputes. In no way will this 
complaint be relied upon in reaching a decision on the present motion practice, especially Novartis and Vetter's Rule 12(b)(6) 
motions."
1781,3, Pagination corresponds with CM/ECF.
1781,4, The parties do not dispute that Regeneron's tortious interference claim comes under New York law. 
1783,5," Both parties would also file short responsive claim construction briefs on January 24, 2022. Novartis, 1:20-CV-690, Dkts. 109; 
111. In Regeneron's brief, it requested leave to file a reply brief in the event that Novartis filed a responsive brief, because 
Novartis's initial submission was decidedly barebones. However, because Novartis's responsive brief only dealt with 
Regeneron's arguments and continues to disavow any true dispute of the claim construction, permitting Regeneron to file a reply 
brief would be a waste of time and effort that this Court will not indulge. "
1786,6," Although the Court notes that Regeneron alleges that some 80% of anti-VEGF patients switched from vial to PFS once the 
latter option was introduced, that exodus at current price points does not suggest that if Novartis attempted to raise prices 
beyond a ""small"" discrepancy that those patients could not or would not simply switch back to their vials. Thus, Regeneron has 
still failed to allege that the availability of vials as an alternative would not constrain Novartis's ability to set prices as required to 
establish a product market. See Grp. Health, 649 F.3d at 155. "
1787,7," HN19[
] ""Unlike federal law, . . . New York state law does not differentiate between doctrines of fraudulent concealment (equitable tolling) and equitable estoppel."" In re Fischer, 308 B.R. 631, 656 (E.D.N.Y. 2004). "
1788,8," HN22[
] Under New York law, a claim asserted for the first time in an amended complaint relates back to the date of the initial 
complaint for the purposes of calculating the statute of limitations if the facts in the amended and initial complaints cover the 
same ""transaction or occurrence."" Smith v. Bank of N.Y. Mellon Corp., 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44018, 2011 WL 1642318, at *1 
(S.D.N.Y. Apr. 25, 2011). Because the initial antitrust complaint also dealt with an alleged breach of the Development 
Agreement, Regeneron's tortious interference claims likely relate back to the filing of the initial antitrust complaint. However, 
since both complaints were filed well after 2018, the exercise of relating back is largely academic, so the Court will simply 
assume relation back for the purposes of the present motion practice."
1788,9," Because Regeneron exclusively defended the timeliness of its antitrust claims, it frames its arguments that the statute of 
limitations should be tolled as ""fraudulent concealment"" by Novartis and Vetter using the language employed in antitrust claims. 
See Schenker AG v. Societe Air France, 102 F. Supp. 3d 418, 424 (E.D.N.Y. 2015) (describing fraudulent concealment defense 
to statute of limitations in antitrust cases). For the purposes of the present hypothetical exercise the Court will assume that 
Regeneron also meant to argue for equitable estoppel under a theory of fraudulent concealment under state law. "
1789,10," To whatever extent Regeneron intended to argue that the continuing violation doctrine would save the timeliness of its tortious 
interference claims, the Court notes that ""[t]ortious interference with contract claims are not continuing torts, instead accruing 
when the defendant performs an action or inaction that constitutes interference."" Tarazi v. Truehope Inc., 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
120155, 2017 WL 5957665, at *19 (S.D.N.Y. July 28, 2017) (citation omitted). That theory thus cannot save Regeneron's 
tortious interference claims, either."
1789,11," By extension, Novartis's request for oral argument is denied as moot. "
1799,1," CS Defendants frequently refer to ""FX markets"" instead of the FX market in their Rule 56.1 statement. [Dkt. 1594-53 ¶¶ 39, 40]. 
However, CS Defendants provide no basis for viewing the FX market as a series of markets. The expert report the CS 
Defendants cite refers to ""the FX Market"" and in their Answer to the Third Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint, CS 
Defendants refer to the ""FX market"" without denying the appropriateness of referring to it as a single market. CS Defendants 
dispute the use of the word ""market."" However, in their answer to the operative complaint and in their expert report, ""market"" is

1817,7, This opinion cites the DPP Complaint as the other plaintiffs' complaints are substantially identical. 
1823,8," Defendants argue that Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs' allegations that the side agreements were pretextual sound in fraud and 
therefore must be pleaded with particularity in accordance with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b). Dkt. No. 269 at 16-17. The 
Court will not apply a heightened pleading standard. In FTC v. Actavis, when faced with similar allegations—that the ""true point 
of the payments"" from the brand manufacturer to the generics ""was to compensate the generics for agreeing not to compete 
against [the brand-name drug] until 2015,"" 570 U.S. 136, 145, 133 S. Ct. 2223, 186 L. Ed. 2d 343 (2013)—the Supreme Court 
did not impose the heightened pleading standard of Rule 9(b). "
1826,9," The challenge is compounded by some ambiguity within Actavis itself. In summarizing its holding, the Supreme Court stated, ""a 
reverse payment, where large and unjustified, can bring with it the risk of significant anticompetitive effects,"" and also stated, 
""one who makes such a payment may be unable to explain and justify it."" Id. at 158. The Actavis Court elsewhere stated that 
where the plaintiff has alleged a large and unjustified payment, ""[a]n antitrust defendant may show in the antitrust proceeding 
that legitimate justifications are present, thereby explaining the presence of the challenged term and showing the lawfulness of 
that term under the rule of reason."" Id. at 156. It is not clear from the four corners of the opinion the circumstances where a 
reverse payment may be both large and unjustified and still able to be explained and justified by the defendant. "
1831,10," Relatedly, Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs argue that the contingent launch provision in each of the settlement agreements supports 
joint and several liability for all Defendants if one or more of them have been found liable for agreeing to an unlawful reverse 
payment. Dkt. No. 285 at 43-45, 44 n.19. To support this argument, Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs rely on tort principles and cite to 
In re Modafinil Antitrust Litigation, 837 F.3d 238 (3d Cir. 2016). This argument is not sound. HN15[
] ""Under the doctrine of joint 
and several liability, '[i]f the tortious conduct of each of two or more persons is a legal cause of harm that cannot be apportioned, 
each is subject to liability for the entire harm, irrespective of whether their conduct is concurring or consecutive.'"" Id. at 262 n.29 
(alteration in original) (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts § 879 (1979)). The doctrine requires that each liable person 
engage in tortious conduct. By analogy, each defendant to be held jointly and severally liable must have engaged in 
anticompetitive conduct. But Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs seek to hold liable even those that have not agreed to an anticompetitive 
reverse-payment agreement by virtue of a contingent launch provision, which by itself has the effect of increasing competition if 
activated. Similarly, In re Modafinil Antitrust Litigation does not support Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs' conclusion. In that case, 
which involved similar allegations of reverse-settlement agreements, the defendants appealed the district court's class "
1832,," certification decision. One of the defendants' arguments was that predominance under Rule 23(b)(3) cannot be demonstrated 
because the plaintiffs' theory of liability must isolate the harm that each individual reverse-payment settlement agreement 
caused each individual class member under the doctrine of antitrust standing. Id. at 261. The defendants argued that the 
plaintiffs were attempting to circumvent the doctrine of antitrust standing by asserting the theory of joint and several liability. Id. 
at 262. The Third Circuit rejected the defendants' argument and determined that ""because all four [generic manufacturers 
allegedly] entered into these reverse-payment settlement agreements and prevented a competitive market from forming, each 
contributed to the market-wide harm, and each can be held jointly and severally liable for such harm."" Id. at 266. Putting aside 
that this discussion was in the context of a class certification decision, the Third Circuit's conclusion also explicitly relied on all 
four generic manufacturers allegedly entering into anticompetitive arrangements with the brand manufacturer. In other words, 
each entity to be held jointly and severally liable had entered into an anticompetitive agreement. By contrast, Direct Purchaser 
Plaintiffs here, solely based on the competition-increasing contingent launch provisions, attempt to hold liable even those 
Defendants who are not determined to be parties to anticompetitive reverse-settlement agreements. "
1834,11," As Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs refer to the [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] agreement in the DPP Complaint and rely on 
its effect, the Court may consider it on a motion to dismiss. See Broder v. Cablevision Sys. Corp., 418 F.3d 187, 196 (2d Cir.

1852,4," Peterson passingly asserts that the state-law claims are not barred by sovereign immunity because the FAC alleges that they 
acted unlawfully, acted outside the scope of their authority, and took ministerial actions. MBC Oppo. 8. While these types of 
allegations may affect whether an official is entitled to the separate protection of absolute immunity from Section 1983 damages 
actions (discussed below), Peterson cites no authority for the position that they overcome sovereign immunity, and this positions 
would contradict its fundamental principles."
1852,5," Because the state-law claims are dismissed on this basis, there is no need to address the MBC Defendants' argument that they 
are also immune under state statute."
1852,6," For the reasons explained below, Peterson has not shown that the HCQIA creates a private right of action, so that claim is 
dismissed with prejudice on this basis. "
1854,7," Because the state of the claims is unclear, I do not address the MBC Defendants' alternative argument that the claims are time-
barred."
1854,8," The antitrust claim is not brought under Section 1983, so that statute's immunity doctrines do not apply."
1854,9," The Sutter Defendants also make this argument, and the reasons stated in this section apply equally to them. "
1859,10," The two state-court cases that Peterson cites do not hold or suggest that the HCQIA creates a private right of action for his 
claim. See Fahlen v. Sutter Cent. Valley Hosps., 58 Cal. 4th 655, 685, 168 Cal. Rptr. 3d 165, 318 P.3d 833 (2014); Clark v.

StarKist Co. Based on Guilty Pleas and Admis. in Parallel Criminal Proceedings (ECF No. 2654), Bumble Bee filed for 
bankruptcy protection. See In re: Bumble Bee Parent, Inc. et al., Case No. 19-12502-LSS (Bankr. D. Del.). As a result, 
proceedings against Bumble Bee are currently stayed and all claims against it have been administratively closed. (ECF No. 
2286.) Accordingly, this Order identifies Bumblebee only insofar as it was one of the original Moving Parties. In addition, Lion 
Capital LLP (a British private equity firm that purchased Bumble Bee in 2010) and Big Catch Cayman LP (a holding company 
that wholly owns Bumble Bee) have been dismissed pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). (ECF No. 2270.) A 
motion for reconsideration is pending. (ECF No. 2285.) Lion Capital (Americas), a U.S. subsidiary of Lion Capital LLP, remains

Specially Appearing Defendants Lion Capital LLP and Big Catch Cayman LP."

1877,3, The public redacted version of this briefing can be found at ECF No. 2088. The version cited here is the sealed brief.
1877,4," According to a presentation prepared by StarKist and Del Monte, the ""rightsizing plan"" was a proprietary and confidential 
initiative aimed at ""enabling category growth the right way."" (DAPs' Opp'n to Defs.' Mot., Ex. 9, ECF No. 2084.) The plan outlines 
that StarKist would ""reduce select canned business net weight from 6.0oz to 5.0oz while increasing fish fill percentage by over 
4.0pts."" (Id.) It proceeds to outline all other modifications in can sizes, can weights, and fish fill in a variety of products. (Id.) "

1880,11," DAPs allege that they ""had neither actual nor constructive knowledge of the facts constituting their claims for relief"" and that 
they ""did not discover and could not have discovered through the exercise of reasonable diligence, the existence of the 
conspiracy alleged herein until at least July 2015."" See, e.g., Affiliated Foods Plaintiffs' Fourth Amended Complaint at ¶¶ 249-50 
(ECF No. 1431); The Kroger Complaint at ¶ 179 (ECF No. 1422). "
1881,12," According to Affiliated Foods Plaintiffs' Fourth Amended Complaint (Pls.' Fourth Am. Compl. for Violation of the Sherman Act, 
15 U.S.C. § 1, ECF No. 1431), ""StarKist, Bumble Bee, and Chicken of the Sea sell Packaged Tuna in the United States. The 
United States Packaged Tuna industry generates annual sales of approximately $1.7 billion. Defendants dominated the United 
States market for Packaged Tuna throughout the Relevant Period, with a combined market share of 80-85%. Each Defendant's "

(24-25%); and Chicken of the Sea (15-17%)."" (Id. at ¶ 97-98.) "
1895,1," From March 2017 through 2019, OptumRx managed the County's pharmacy network, which entailed processing pharmacy 
claims for prescriptions dispensed to Harris County's Beneficiaries and operated mail-order pharmacies that delivered 
prescription drugs to Harris County's Beneficiaries. Dkt. 127 at 92 ¶ 411. In OptumRx's capacity as a mail-order pharmacy, the 
County alleges that OptumRx ""dispensed diabetes medications...nationwide and in Texas, including in Harris County."" Id. 39 ¶ 
189. The County does not allege that it directly purchased diabetes medications from OptumRx through its mail-order 
pharmacies. See id. "
1896,2," The County also alleges that following Cigna's merger with Express Scripts in December 2018 and Cigna Pharmacy 
Management's consolidation with Express Scripts, Express Scripts and Cigna Pharmacy Management worked in coordination to 
provide PBM services to Plaintiff Harris County. Dkt. 127 at 93 ¶ 412. These services included developing and offering 
formularies for the County's prescription plan, constructing and managing the County's pharmacy network, processing pharmacy 
claims, and providing mail-order pharmacy services to the County. Id. In providing these services to the Harris County, Express 
Scripts and Cigna Pharmacy Management set the amount the County paid for the at-issue drugs in coordination with the 
Manufacturer Defendants and utilizing the false price generated by the Insulin Pricing Scheme, received payments for the at-
issue drugs and, in turn, reimbursed the pharmacies that dispensed drugs to Harris County beneficiaries. Id. ¶ 413. Cigna 
merged with defendant Express Scripts at an unstated date. See id. 66 ¶ 283. "
1897,3," In concluding that the County ""allege[d] that it pa[id] the PBM Defendants directly,"" the court cited the County's response to the 
defendants' motions to dismiss. See Dkt. 66 at 29 (citing Dkt. 48 at 13). That portion of the County's motion argued that ""Harris 
County paid...the at-issue overcharges to the PBMs, not an intervening distributor or other link in the distribution chain."" Dkt. 48 
at 13. However, the Fifth Circuit has instructed that, with limited exception not applicable here, a ""district court may not go 
outside the complaint"" when deciding a Rule 12(b)(6) motion. Scanlan v. Texas A&M Univ., 343 F.3d 533, 536 (5th Cir. 2003). 
The portion of the First Amended Complaint that lent the most support to the County's assertion that it directly paid the PBM 
defendants is found in paragraph 207, which explained that ""[a] PBM develops the health plan's drug formulary...and is paid by 
the health plan for the drugs utilized by the health plan's beneficiaries."" Dkt. 20 at 44 ¶ 207. "
1899,4," Treatment of Illinois Brick as a bright-line rule does not represent a departure from the principle of proximate causation so 
much as it illustrates a tightening of the requisite causal nexus between the injury and injurious conduct. Indeed, as the Supreme 
Court has explained elsewhere, ""[t]he proximate-cause inquiry is not easy to define, and over the years it has taken various 
forms."" Lexmark Int'l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 133, 134 S. Ct. 1377, 188 L. Ed. 2d 392 (2014). "
1900,5," From this court's research, the Seventh Circuit's decision in Fontana Aviation, Inc. v. Cessna Aircraft Company was the first 
amongst the Courts of Appeals to support suspending Illinois Brick in the context of multi-tiered price-fixing conspiracies. See 
617 F.2d 478, 481 (7th Cir. 1980). In that case, a divided panel opined that it was ""not satisfied that the Illinois Brick rule directly 
applies in circumstances where the manufacturer and the intermediary are both alleged to be co-conspirators in a common 
illegal enterprise resulting in intended injury to the buyer."" Id. at 481. Before that, the co-conspirator exception's roots can be 
traced to Gas-A-Tron of Ariz. v. Am. Oil Co., No. CIV 73-191-TUC-WCF, 1977 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12513, 1977 WL 1519, at *2 (D. 
Ariz. Dec. 7, 1977). "
1901,6," The subsequent procedural developments in Sunday Ticket merit mention. Following the Ninth Circuit's decision, the National 
Football League appealed to the Supreme Court. Though the Court denied the League's petition for a writ of certiorari, Justice 
Kavanaugh issued a statement explaining that the interlocutory posture of the case counseled against further review. See Nat'l 
Football League v. Ninth Inning, Inc., 141 S. Ct. 56, 57, 208 L. Ed. 2d 291 (2020) (Kavanaugh, J., respecting the denial of 
certiorari). More importantly, Justice Kavanaugh opined that the Sunday Ticket ""plaintiffs may not have antitrust standing to sue 
the NFL"" because the Court's ""case law 'authorizes suits by direct purchasers but bars suits by indirect purchasers.'"" Id. (citing 
Apple Inc., 139 S.Ct. at 1520) (emphasis original). In a concluding remark, Justice Kavanaugh offered that if the NFL did not 
""prevail at summary judgment or at trial,"" it could ""raise those legal arguments again in a new petition for certiorari."" Id. "
1902,7," The court previously denied the defendants' motion to dismiss on the County's DTPA claims in its March 2021 Order, 
concluding that the County plausibly pleaded underlying DTPA claims against all the defendants. Dkt. 82 at 13. "
1903,8," The manufacturers argued that ""classic antitrust claims of price-fixing and monopolization"" were not cognizable under the 
DTPA. Segura, 907 S.W.2d at 504. The Segura Court did not decide that issue. "
1904,9," The court analyzes the County's unjust enrichment and money-had-and-received claims under the same rubric because ""[a] 
cause of action for money had and received belongs conceptually to the doctrine of unjust enrichment."" Amoco Prod. Co. v. 
Smith, 946 S.W.2d 162, 164 (Tex. App. 1997, no writ)."
1904,10," To be sure, there are some exceptions to this rule. A claim for restitution or unjust enrichment might still be made when, for 
instance, a defendant verbally contracted to sell a certain item at an agreed-upon price sells it and later denies his counterpart 
an interest in the proceeds of the sale. See, e.g., Staats v. Miller, 150 Tex. 581, 243 S.W.2d 686, 687-88 (1951) (allowing 
restitution for excess money held by defendant after selling plaintiffs' cotton harvester pursuant to oral contract). Likewise, 
restitution might be available where a party overpays an agreed-upon rate. So, for instance, if A contracts to buy widgets from B 
for $65.00 and B then refuses to deliver the widgets unless A pays him $110.00, A may bring an unjust enrichment claim. See, 
e.g., Bowers v. Missouri, Kan. & Tex. Ry. Co., 241 S.W. 509, 510-11 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 1922, no writ) (allowing 
restitution for freight charges paid in excess of rates specified in shipping contract); Nat. Gas Pipeline Co. of Am. v. Harrington, 
246 F.2d 915, 921 (5th Cir. 1957) (agreeing that plaintiff was entitled to restitution where it paid, ""involuntarily and under protest,"" 
in excess of contracted-for price). These exceptions do not apply here. "
1918,1," See Scheduling Order No. 15 [ECF No. 4641] (entered on May 13, 2021); and Scheduling Order No. 16 [ECF No. 4748] 
(entered on June 17, 2021). "
1919,2," Although the all the DAPs in this case, at the Court's instance [ECF Nos. 3653, 3700], have filed an omnibus complaint that 
accumulates in one place the factual allegations and legal claims being made by more than 150 DAPs in their individual 
complaints, they have maintained the independent legal existence of their individual cases. See Direct Action Plaintiffs' 
Amended Consolidated Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial [ECF No. 4244], at 2 (stating ""DAPs understand the Court's orders 
to preserve the independent legal existence of each DAP case""). "
1920,3," The parties have taken almost 400 depositions in this case. See Tyson Defendants' Opposition to Aldi's Motion to Compel 
Individualized Discovery [ECF No. 4865], at 2. As the Court made clear during a May 24, 2021 hearing when it extended the fact 
discovery close date to July 30, 2021 to allow the parties to complete discovery that was then in progress and had been timely 
served or noticed, the extension of the fact discovery close date was not intended to give anyone free rein to serve new 
discovery. See May 24, 2021 Hearing Transcript [ECF No. 4814], at 20; 21-22 (""I would extend fact discovery to July 30th for the 
taking of depositions and for the completion of discovery timely served.""). Although the Court noted that depositions could be 
taken during that time, the Court did not necessarily mean that depositions that had not yet been noticed would be allowed."
1920,4," In McCann v. Cullinan, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 91362, 2015 WL 4254226 (N.D. Ill. July 14, 2015), Judge Johnston recognized 
the importance of deadlines that are set by the court and concluded that ""[c]ounsel must calendar and meet dates. And if 
counsel is going to miss a deadline, then counsel should file a motion seeking an extension before the deadline has passed."" 
2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 91362, [WL] at *2 (citing cases). In Hard Surface Sols., Inc. v. Sherwin-Williams Co., 271 F.R.D. 612 
(N.D. Ill. 2010), Judge Cole noted ""[u]nder the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, it is the court's prerogative-indeed, its duty-to 
manage its caseload and to set and enforce discovery and other significant deadlines.... A party does not have the option of 
complying with those deadlines or ignoring them and then demanding that the court and the opposing party restructure the 
discovery schedule to accommodate the violation."" Id. at 617 (citing Reales v. CONRAIL, 84 F.3d 993, 996 (7th Cir. 1996))."
1920,5," The word ""Cheney,"" for example, does not appear in Bojangles' original complaint [ECF No. 4120-1] or in its amended 
complaint [ECF No. 4347]. A footnote in paragraph 61 of the Direct Action Plaintiffs' Amended Consolidated Complaint and 
Demand for Jury Trial does reference the existence of a dispute between Bojangles and Cheney as to the proper party to assert 
claims arising from Bojangles' purchases of Broiler chickens through its distributor, Pate Dawson, which Cheney acquired in 
2016. The footnote then says, ""Bojangles reserves all of its rights on this issue."" [ECF Nos. 4243, 4244], at 67-68, ¶ 61, n.5. In 
their Consolidated Answer, Defendants do not respond to the Bojangles DAPs' statement in footnote 5 of the Consolidated 
Complaint about its dispute with Cheney, presumably because no response was required. Defendants' Consolidated Answer 
and Affirmative Defenses to Direct Action Plaintiffs' Amended And Consolidated Complaint [ECF No. 4417], at 77-78, ¶ 61. "
1923,1," Unless otherwise noted, the facts described in this section come from the well-pleaded allegations in the complaint. As is 
required at this early stage, all inferences are drawn in favor of the plaintiff. See Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 
555-56, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007)."
1923,2," Align disputes this characterization, arguing that the agreements do not limit SmileDirectClub's ability to sell aligners through 
dentists. While Align may have the better reading of the contracts, the plaintiffs' reading is plausible. Drawing all inferences in the 
plaintiffs' favor, as must be done at this stage, the Court accepts the plaintiffs' interpretation for the purposes of this motion. See 
Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555-56. "
1925,3," The fact that Align and SmileDirectClub structured this deal through two contracts, as opposed to one, does not impact the 
analysis, as antitrust liability does not hinge on such formalities. The challenged restraint must be considered in the context of 
the agreement as a whole. "
1927,4," The plaintiffs point out that the restraint on SmileDirectClub's ability to enter the dentist-directed market extended to December 
31, 2019, while at least some of Align's patents were set to expire in late 2017. This fact alone is insufficient to plausibly allege "
1928,," that the restraint had anticompetitive effects. For one thing, the plaintiffs do not clearly allege when SmileDirectClub would have 
lawfully been able to enter the dentist-directed market in the absence of this restraint. Further, the plaintiffs have not alleged that 
any delay resulted in anticompetitive effects, when considered within the context of the broader, procompetitive agreement. After 
all, this restraint would not have prevented other firms from entering the dentist-directed market upon the expiration of Align's 
patents. "
1935,1," The Court can ""take judicial notice of agency records and reports"" such as the Commerce Report, which appears in the Federal 
Register. See Terrebonne v. Blackburn, 646 F.2d 997, 1000 (5th Cir. 1981). Plaintiffs presented no opposition to Defendants' 
arguments on judicial notice. "
1936,2," The Court can consider JSW's exclusion requests and Defendants' related filings because they are ""referred to in the plaintiff's 
complaint and ware central to [its] claim[s]."" Collins v. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, 224 F.3d 496, 498-99 (5th Cir. 2000) 
(quotation omitted). Plaintiffs presented no opposition to Defendants' arguments on judicial notice."
1936,3," In support of its objection, Nucor cited: (1) JSW's own exclusion request writing; (2) trade association data; (3) public 
information that various manufacturers, including U.S. Steel and ArcelorMittal, had idled or under-utilized facilities that could "
