23,1," That lawsuit is titled PharmacyChecker.com LLP v. National Association of Boards of Pharmacy, et al., Case No. 7:19-cv-
07577-KMK (S.D.N.Y.) (the New York Lawsuit). In that action, PharmacyChecker also alleges false advertising in violation of § 
43 of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125, against NABP. The Lanham Act claim is not relevant here. "
24,2," The Noerr-Pennington doctrine derives its name from two cases, Eastern R.R. Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, 
Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 81 S. Ct. 523, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464 (1961), and United Mine Workers of America v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 85 
S. Ct. 1585, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626 (1965). The Supreme Court expanded the doctrine in California Motor Transportation Co. v. 
Trucking Unlimited, 404 U.S. 508, 92 S. Ct. 609, 30 L. Ed. 2d 642 (1972)."
24,3," LegitScript is a limited liability company organized under the laws of the State of Oregon with its principal place of business in 
Oregon."
24,4," As noted, Judge Karas concluded that PharmacyChecker adequately alleged a conspiracy to restrain trade that included 
NABP, ASOP, CSIP, and PSM among the conspirators and that PharmacyChecker's claim under the antitrust laws against these 
defendants was not barred by the statute of limitations. On these issues, Judge Karas ruled only regarding these four 
defendants. After concluding that the federal court in New York lacked personal jurisdiction over LegitScript, Judge Karas did not 
rule—one way or the other—on those questions regarding LegitScript. See PharmacyChecker.com, 530 F. Supp. 3d at 345 
n.20."
24,5," These facts come from PharmacyChecker's Amended Complaint (ECF 82). At this stage of the lawsuit, the Court accepts as 
true all well-pleaded factual allegations and draws all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. "
25,6, NABP remains a defendant in the New York Lawsuit.
25,7, ASOP remains a defendant in the New York Lawsuit.
25,8," PhRMA refers to ""Pharmaceutical Researchers and Manufacturers of America."" AC ¶ 7."
25,9, CSIP remains a defendant in the New York Lawsuit. 
26,10, PSM remains a defendant in the New York Lawsuit. 
29,11," LegitScript does not argue here any of the other bases for dismissal presented to Judge Karas in the joint motion to dismiss. In 
that motion, the defendants in the New York Lawsuit argued that PharmacyChecker failed adequately to allege antitrust injury, 
failed to show that the per se standard should apply versus the rule of reason, failed to correctly define the relevant market or 
markets, and failed adequately to allege harm to competition. Judge Karas's thorough and well-reasoned opinion addressed and 
rejected those issues at the pleading stage. LegitScript has not raised these issues in its motion that is now before the Court."
29,12," As the Ninth Circuit explained: A knowing wink can mean more than words. Let us suppose five competitors meet on several occasions, discuss their 
problems, and one finally states—'I won't fix prices with any of you, but here is what I am going to do—put the price of my 
gidget at X dollars; now you all do what you want.' He then leaves the meeting. Competitor number two says—'I don't care 
whether number one does what he says he's going to do or not; nor do I care what the rest of you do, but I am going to 
price my gidget at X dollars.' Number [**26]  three makes a similar statement—'My price is X dollars.' Number four says not 
one word. All leave and fix 'their' prices at 'X' dollars. Esco Corp. v. United States, 340 F.2d 1000, 1007 (9th Cir. 1965)."
29,13," ""Direct evidence of a conspiracy is evidence that is explicit and requires no inferences to establish the proposition or 
conclusion being asserted."" Burtch v. Milberg Factors, Inc., 662 F.3d 212, 225 (3d Cir. 2011) (quotation marks omitted). Direct 
evidence may consist of written documents, audio or video recordings, or eyewitness testimony about what was said."
29,14," ""But antitrust law limits the range of permissible inferences from ambiguous evidence in a § 1 case. Thus, . . . conduct as 
consistent with permissible competition as with illegal conspiracy does not, standing alone, support an inference of antitrust 
conspiracy."" Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 588, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). "
30,15," As the facts develop, this case also may present some similarities with ""hub and spoke"" antitrust conspiracies based on the 
blurring of horizontal and vertical restraints. See generally In re Musical Instruments & Equip. Antitrust Litig., 798 F.3d 1186, 
1192 (9th Cir. 2015) (noting that ""the line between horizontal and vertical restraints can blur"" and adding that although the Third 
and Seventh Circuits have recognized ""hub and spoke"" antitrust conspiracies, the Ninth Circuit has not yet done so). "
31,16," That PharmacyChecker has not alleged specific activities linking LegitScript and PSM is insufficient for the Court to dismiss 
PharmacyChecker's antitrust claim against LegitScript. As noted, there is more than enough evidence, at least at the pleading 
stage, to state a conspiracy claim involving LegitScript, NABP, ASOP, and CSIP. Further, Judge Karas in the New York Lawsuit 
found that PharmacyChecker adequately stated a conspiracy claim involving ASOP, CSIP, NABP, and PSM. Collectively, this is 
sufficient for the Court here to allow PharmacyChecker to proceed in the pending action against LegitScript, alleging a 
conspiracy among LegitScript, NABP, ASOP, CSIP, and PSM. "
32,17," At oral argument, the Court noted that LegitScript appeared to make a typographical error in its motion. LegitScript stated in its 
motion that the date of the allegedly false paid news release jointly published by LegitScript and ASOP was August 13, 2015. 
ECF 238, at 16. At oral argument, LegitScript agreed that this was an error on its part and that the Amended Complaint in fact 
alleged that the joint news release was issued on August 18, 2015. AC ¶ 85(a). This act is within four years of the filing of the 
original complaint and allegedly caused harm to PharmacyChecker. "
35,1," This is a corrected, unsealed version of a Report and Recommendation previously issued as a sealed document in this case. 
(Docket Entry 457.) Non-substantive, typographical changes have been made to the document, and it has been unsealed after 
consultation with the parties. (See Docket Entries 459 and 460.) "
36,2," The undersigned issued a previous Report and Recommendation reviewing in greater detail the background of the MCO 
payment system, the American allergy market, and UAS's business model. (Docket Entry 135.) To the extent that facts have 
developed since the motion to dismiss stage, the undersigned includes a summary of the relevant facts in this Report and 
Recommendation. To the extent any of the facts cited are subject to evidentiary objections by any party, such objections are 
overruled, without prejudice to the parties' ability to make further objection at trial. "
37,3," About six months later, in November of 2013, Dr. Glomb became a Senior Medical Director for Superior. (Docket Entry 392-57, 
at 10, 28.) "
40,4," Binh Hoa Le v. Exeter Fin. Corp., 990 F.3d 410 (5th Cir. 2021). "
43,5," For the purposes of this standing analysis only, the Court should assume that the conduct in question constitutes an antitrust 
violation. As the Fifth Circuit has explained, a ""[s]tanding analysis can be most helpful in the atypical antitrust case if the court 
assumes an antitrust violation has occurred and then determines whether the plaintiff has suffered injury-in-fact, is a proper 
plaintiff, and has experienced 'antitrust injury' from the violation."" Doctor's Hosp. of Jefferson, 123 F.3d at 306."
43,6," In their answers, Defendants assert Illinois Brick among their defenses (Docket Entry 148, at 26; Docket Entry 215, at 24), and 
Plaintiffs address this defense as part of their motion for summary judgment on Defendants' affirmative defenses (Docket Entry 
414, at 22-27). However, at the hearing on the motions, both parties acknowledged that Illinois Brick is not an independent 
affirmative defense, but rather a line of cases relevant to a proper plaintiff analysis. "
44,7," In arguing the issue of standing, the parties point to two other UAS cases filed in courts outside this district: United Biologics, 
LLC d/b/a United Allergy Services v. Amerigroup Tennessee, Inc., et al., No. 3:19-cv-180 (E.D. Tenn. January 27, 2022), and 
Acad. of Allergy & Asthma in Primary Care v. La. Health Serv. & Indem. Co., No. CV 18-399, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 213954, 
2021 WL 5029418 (E.D. La. May 14, 2021). Those two decisions came to opposite conclusions, but neither supports Superior's 
standing argument here. In Louisiana Health Serv., the district court, reconsidering its earlier decision, relied on Associated Gen. 
Contractors to decide that UAS was indeed a proper plaintiff to bring suit. Louisiana Health Serv., 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
213954, 2021 WL 5029418, at *1-2. In Amerigroup Tennessee, the court found that UAS was not a proper plaintiff to bring suit, 
but its analysis was tied to the ""inextricably intertwined"" doctrine of antitrust standing under Sixth Circuit precedent. No. 3:19-cv-
180, Docket Entry 447-1,Order at 15-18 (No. 177 E.D. Tenn. Jan. 27, 2022). This reasoning appears inapposite here, as none of 
the parties argues that the ""inextricably intertwined"" doctrine controls this Court's analysis. In any event, the Amerigroup 
Tennessee court has certified its ruling for interlocutory appeal to the Sixth Circuit, noting in its certification order that case law 
could be interpreted to support UAS's standing to sue. No. 3:19-cv-180, Docket Entry 448-1, Order at *4-5 (E.D. Tenn. April 27, 
2022). "
45,8," Standing, the Fifth Circuit has counseled, should not become like ""the tail wagging the dog"" when a plaintiff has presented 
evidence that the case is of the type that is typically addressed by antitrust law. Doctor's Hosp. of Jefferson., 123 F.3d at 306."
45,9," The Texas Antitrust Act is interpreted in harmony with federal interpretation of the Sherman Act. See Caller-Times Publ'g Co. v. 
Triad Commc'ns, Inc., 826 S.W.2d 576, 580 (Tex. 1992). "
47,10," The parties present conflicting evidence as to whether these credentialing policies were publicly available during this time 
period. (Compare Docket Entry 394-87, at 2 with Docket Entry 391-56, at 10.) At the summary judgment stage, such conflicts in 
evidence are construed against the movant."
47,11," Superior correctly argues that there is no evidence that Dr. Harmon specifically attended this second meeting. (Docket Entry 
429, at 9; Docket Entry 391-74, at 13.) However, the record indicates that it was attended by Dr. Robert Griffin, the head of 
Superior's credentialing committee, as well as Dr. Glomb, whom Superior would later employ in connection with allergy and 
immunotherapy credentialing. (Docket Entry 392-57, at 32, 37.)"
47,12," The parties also dispute the admissibility of an additional piece of corroborating evidence: testimony from UAS CEO Hollis 
about a conference call among the MCOs about getting all MCOs to implement the credentialing policy. In his declaration, Hollis 
offers testimony that, on October 28, 2013, he had a meeting with Frank Dominguez, CEO of El Paso First; Hollis testifies that 
Dominguez told him that, on a call with other MCOs, Superior was ""stressing that all of the health plans should get on board with 
Superior's policy of only paying allergists."" (Docket Entry 392-43, at 4-5.) Dominguez denies making such a statement. (Docket 
Entry 391-73, at 7.) This testimony was the subject of a previous ruling by the undersigned, which Superior has asked the 
undersigned to reconsider. (Docket Entry 389.) Superior argues that testimony consists of a hearsay statement within a hearsay 
statement; the undersigned found the internal statement to be admissible as a non-hearsay statement in furtherance of a 
conspiracy pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2)(E), and the second layer potentially admissible through Rule 613(b) 
as extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement. (See Docket Entry 378.) There is disagreement about what role this 
testimony may play during the course of summary judgment as opposed to trial. (Docket Entries 389 and 400.) At this stage, the 
undersigned need not consider the admissibility of the testimony, as the evidence already discussed is sufficient to survive a 
motion for summary judgment as to the existence of an agreement between the parties. Therefore, Superior's request for 
reconsideration should be denied without prejudice to reurging either in the form of a motion in limine or an objection at trial. "
49,13," Superior claims that there is countervailing direct evidence that it implemented this policy independently. (Docket Entry 429, at 
8.) Specifically, it presents evidence that Dr. Harmon sought CHC's policy because ""we were already thinking about doing 
something related to credentialing, and so when [Dr. Buckwold] said [CHC] already had a policy, in place . . . I look out publicly 
to see if anyone has already created something that we could use."" (Docket Entry 392-51, at 83.) Superior argues that this 
evidence demonstrates that it had already decided independently to implement such a policy. (Docket Entry 429, at 8.) Contrary 
to this view, it would be entirely reasonable for a jury to consider Dr. Harmon's testimony in light of the other evidence in the 
record and conclude that, while Superior was indeed considering such a policy, it was the assurance of an agreement with CHC 
and other MCOs that provided the deciding factor in going forward with implementation. But even if Superior's view is correct this 
evidence does not require granting summary judgment; at most, it shows that there is a fact issue for the jury to decide. "
50,14," A more complete analysis of Superior's arguments as to the relevant market follows in Part B.2.b.2, infra. "
52,15," The undersigned issued a previous Report and Recommendation addressing the issue of a relevant geographic market, but 
not the relevant product market. (See Docket Entry 135, at 28-30.)"
52,16," The question of proof was an equally important part of Judge Lamberth's ruling against UAS in his recent decision. See 2022 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 60676, 2022 WL 980791, at *4-6 (""This ill-defined market, in reality, describes two separate markets for two 
complementary services. But that is not the only problem. Plaintiffs must allege that this conspiracy restrained trade. They offer 
conclusory allegations and unreasonable inferences to support this claim."")."
52,17," Dr. House's testimony has been the subject of extensive litigation in this case and a previous case before Chief Judge Garcia. 
When Superior moved to strike Dr. House's testimony (Docket Entry 212), the undersigned ordered the parties to submit 
supplemental briefing on Chief Judge Garcia's rulings. See Academy of Allergy & Asthma in Primary Care, et al. v. Allergy and 
Asthma Network/Mothers of Asthmatics, Inc., et al., SA-14-CA-35-OLG, Order (W.D. Tex. Mar. 16, 2017). The parties submitted 
the required briefing and the undersigned held a hearing on the matter. (Docket Entry 280.) Subsequently, Dr. House issued 
further opinions in response to Superior's motion for summary judgment (Docket Entry 394-79), which Superior also moved to 
strike (Docket Entry 345).The undersigned held a hearing on this motion as well, resolving some of the issues raised and 
deferring some to consideration in conjunction with these motions for summary judgment. (Docket Entry 378.) Superior 
incorporates its prior briefing by reference into its motion for summary judgment (Docket Entry 408, at 36), and the undersigned 
has considered the underlying briefing and responses as to the admissibility of Dr. House's testimony in resolution of Superior's 
motion for summary judgment. "
53,," Superior also reurges its motion to strike the declaration of Dr. House as untimely. (Docket Entry 429, at 22.) The undersigned 
declines to strike this testimony on this ground, given that it merely summarizes his previous reports in the case. (Compare 
Docket Entry 394-80, with Docket Entry 394-78.) "
54,18," Indeed, as with Dr. House, it does not appear that Superior's experts have calculated the availability of these potentially 
interchangeable services and their effect on the market. (See Docket Entry 394-54, at 18-24.) "
55,19," The parties refer to a ruling made by Judge Lamberth in yet another related case. (Docket Entry 408, at 44 (citing Acad. of 
Allergy & Asthma in Primary Care v. Quest Diagnostics Inc., 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29479, 2019 WL 919203, at *2 (W.D. Tex. 
Feb. 22, 2019)). This opinion as to the statute of limitations has since been reversed by the Fifth Circuit. See Acad. of Allergy & 
Asthma in Primary Care v. Quest Diagnostics, Inc., 998 F.3d 190, 196-99 (5th Cir. 2021). "
57,20," In support of its invocation of the Noerr-Pennington doctrine, Superior refers to Chief Judge Garcia's summary judgment ruling 
in a previous case, cited above, as well eventual as the jury verdict in that case. While the jury in that case ultimately found 
against the plaintiffs on the basis of the doctrine, the allegations in that case were different. There, the jury specifically found that 
the purpose of the agreement in that case was to persuade local, state, and federal lawmakers to take official government 
action. (Docket Entry 392-15, at 6.) Here, there is at minimum a genuine dispute as to that issue. Indeed, in denying summary 
judgment on the previous case Chief Judge Garcia likewise found a genuine dispute. Academy of Allergy & Asthma in Primary 
Care, et al., v. Allergy & Asthma Network, et al., SA-14-CA-35-OLG, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 222623, Order at 36 (W.D. Tex. 
Sept. 29, 2017). "
61,1," As facts in a complaint are taken as true when evaluating a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, Knievel v. ESPN, 393 F.3d 1068, 
1072 (9th Cir. 2005), the facts recited in this background section are from the Complaint unless otherwise noted. "
65,2," Plaintiffs argue they are entitled to a presumption under Trinko that Sony's business practice was profitable. See Trinko, 540 
U.S. at 409 (""The unilateral termination of a voluntary (and thus presumably profitable) course of dealing suggested a willingness 
to forsake short-term profits to achieve an anticompetitive end.""). Plaintiff cites no case or other authority supporting their 
argument that the mere use of the word ""presumably"" in this opinion creates a burden-shifting presumption of profitability. No 
presumption, therefore, is applied in ruling on this motion. "
68,*," Circuit Judge Kanne, a member of the panel at the time of argument, died on June 16, 2022. This appeal is being decided by a 
quorum. 28 U.S.C. §46(d). "
95,1," In brief summation, the direct purchaser rule is a bilateral rule that prevents indirect purchasers from raising antitrust claims, 
Illinois Brick Co. V. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 97 S. Ct. 2061, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1977), and prevents a Clayton Act defendant from 
arguing a plaintiff suffered no ""injury"" because it passed on any injuries to other customers or assignees, Hanover Shoe, Inc. V. 
United Shoe Mach. Corp., 392 U.S. 481, 88 S. Ct. 2224, 20 L. Ed. 2d 1231 (1968). "
97,2," We reach this issue first because Plaintiffs may have sufficiently alleged the existence of an ""association in fact"" enterprise. 
The amended complaint alleges that UT and CVC were engaged in this enterprise to maximize UT's profits and CVC's executive 
compensation. [D.E. 93, ¶ 214, 363]. Plaintiffs also allege this enterprise was an ""ongoing and continuing unit"" for about four 
years. Id. at ¶ 213, App. D. Lastly, Plaintiffs allege interpersonal relationships between CVC and UT's officers that allowed direct 
communication for the alleged fraudulent activity. Id. at ¶ 217. Moreover, Exhibit A in the amended complaint details the 
Settlement Agreement between UT and the U.S. surrounding UT and CVC's fraudulent behavior. This tangible evidence and 
well-pleaded allegations support the prima facie claim of an existence of a RICO enterprise. "
99,3," While UT's motion to dismiss Counts I and II should be granted on the failure to specifically allege a proximately caused injury, 
the Court does not find UT's arguments concerning the Indirect Purchaser Rule (IDR) persuasive. [D.E. 129 at 14-16]; [D.E. 142 
at 8-13]. RICO statutory law was heavily influenced by statutory antitrust law, Anza, 547 U.S. at 457, but that does not 
indefinitely preclude indirect purchasers from suing under RICO laws. UT relies on the Apple Supreme Court decision and 
several district court decisions to support this assertion, but Apple was an antitrust violation case that did not mention RICO. 139 
S. Ct. at 1520 (""[W]e have ruled that indirect purchasers who are two or more steps removed from the violator in a distribution 
chain may not sue. Our decision in Illinois Brick established a bright-line rule that authorizes suits by direct purchasers but bars 
suits by indirect purchasers."") (citing Illinois Brick v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 746, 97 S. Ct. 2061, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707). Although RICO 
jurisprudence prioritizes directness, which is ultimately why Plaintiffs fail to allege a direct economic injury and their claims must 
be dismissed, that does not mean every RICO case should follow a ""bright-line"" rule precluding indirect purchasers from suing 
antitrust violators. "
100,4," Defendants also urge the dismissal of the ""tag-along"" state law claims for Plaintiffs' impermissible shotgun pleading. [D.E. 129 
at 22-29]. These arguments are not as persuasive considering Plaintiffs provided adequate notice to each Defendant with an in-
depth factual allegations section, [D.E. 93, ¶ 63-198], and Plaintiffs explicitly named each Defendant in each count of the 
complaint, Id. [*40]  at ¶ 206-379. Thus, Plaintiffs have provided adequate notice to each Defendant in the complaint, and the 
amended complaint is not an impermissible shotgun pleading. See Weiland v. Palm Beach Cnty. Sheriff's Off., 792 F. 3d 1313, 
1320 (11th Cir. 2015). "
103,1," The Motion is filed as Docket No. 57. The Court will refer to the memorandum of points and authorities, Docket No. 57-1, as the 
Motion. "
104,2," The history between Tripharma and First Fruits has been recounted on numerous occasions, most recently in this Court's order 
regarding Tripharma's motion for a preliminary injunction, Dkt. No. 63. The Court accepts all well-pleaded allegations in the SAC 
as true for purposes of the Motion. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009). The Court 
also notes that these facts largely correspond to prior orders recounting the facts."
104,3," Tripharma attaches the amended and restated EMSA dated October 1, 2007 to the SAC as Exhibit B. EMSA, Dkt. No. 48-2. "
105,4," The order in the 2012 Action at Docket No. 214 is also included in Defendants' requests for judicial notice. See Defs. RJN, Ex. 
1, Dkt. No. 57-3. "
113,1, First names of the Nourmands are used for clarity and efficiency. No disrespect is intended.
113,2," Any evidentiary objections not set forth in a separate memorandum are in violation of this Court's Scheduling and Case 
Management Order and are therefore disregarded. (See Scheduling & Case Management Order 8, ECF No. 48 (""Evidentiary 
objections should be addressed in a separate memorandum to be filed with the opposition or reply brief of the party."").) "
116,3," Defendants object to the use of the Thomas Expert Report on several grounds, including relevance, lack of authentication, 
improper expert opinion, and unfair prejudice. In this particular context, these objections are unavailing and are OVERRULED. 
Here, Relevant uses the report in opposition to the Sunset Defendants' Motion, to demonstrate that Sunset Landmark often filed 
voluminous objections right before public hearings. If Relevant wishes to prove this fact at trial, Relevant will be able to do so by, 
among other things, introducing as evidence copies of the objections Sunset Landmark filed. Such documents are not made 
inadmissible by the rule against hearsay because they are records of a public agency and would not be offered for the truth of 
any matter asserted therein. See, e.g., Minor v. FedEx Off. & Print Servs. Inc., 78 F. Supp. 3d 1021, 1027 (N.D. Cal. 2015); Fed. 
R. Evid. 801. "
117,4," The Court GRANTS judicial notice of the Tentative Ruling issued in the Thompson matter. See Lee v. City of Los Angeles, 250 
F.3d 668, 689 (9th Cir. 2001) (authorizing judicial notice of ""matters of public record,"" including court filings); Fed R. Evid. 201. 
""However, when a court takes judicial notice of another court's filings, it does so not for the truth of the facts recited therein, but 
for the existence of the opinion"" and its undisputed legal effects. Starks v. County of Los Angeles, No. 2:21-cv-05209-ODW 
(GJSx), 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 83395, 2022 WL 1344986, at *1 (Mar. 28, 2022) (citing S.B. by & through Kristina B. v. Cal. Dep't 
of Educ., 327 F. Supp. 3d 1218, 1229 n.1 (E.D. Cal. 2018))."
117,5," Defendants object to Relevant opposing summary judgment with this evidence ""on the grounds that characterization of 'blood 
money' are [sic] being offered for the truth of the matter asserted."" (Defs. Joint Objs. 2.) In the first place, this objection is 
conclusory and rather inscrutable and is OVERRULED on that basis. (Scheduling & Case Management Order 8-9 (""Do not 
submit blanket or boilerplate objections to the opponent's statements of undisputed fact. These will be disregarded and 
overruled.""). Moreover, Silverstein's assertions in this conversation, even if they are offered for their truth, are not hearsay under 
one or more of the provisions of Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2). In the alternative, the hearsay objection does not prevent 
the Court from considering the statement on summary judgment, because Defendants make no suggestion that Silverstein will 
be unavailable to testify regarding this conversation at trial. See Burch, 433 F. Supp. 2d at 1120. Defendants also object on 
prejudice grounds pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 403, but these objections are boilerplate, and, in any case, are 
not well taken and are OVERRULED. "
119,6," ""CEQA forbids 'piecemeal' review of the significant environmental impacts of a project."" Berkeley Keep Jets Over the Bay 
Comm. v. Bd. of Port Comm'rs, 91 Cal. App. 4th 1344, 1358, 111 Cal. Rptr. 2d 598 (2001). ""Rather, CEQA mandates 'that 
environmental considerations do not become submerged by chopping a large project into many little ones—each with a minimal 
potential impact on the environment—which cumulatively may have disastrous consequences.'"" Cal. Clean Energy Comm. v. 
City of Woodland, 225 Cal. App. 4th 173, 193, 170 Cal. Rptr. 3d 488 (2014) (citing Bozung v. Local Agency Formation Comm., 
13 Cal. 3d 263, 283-284, 118 Cal. Rptr. 249, 529 P.2d 1017 (1975)). The Sunset Defendants argue that the piecemealing 
argument Maddren raised shows that the CEQA challenges to the Selma were meritorious. Relevant insists that piecemealing 
was not a substantive problem because ""the City could clarify the record and easily address the technicality."" (PAMF re: N&A 
Mot. 73.) The record on the piecemealing issue in this case is incomplete; in any case, whether Maddren's piecemealing 
argument had merit appears to be quite tangential to the issues raised by these Motions, especially given that no Defendant 
contends it raised a piecemealing argument of its own in any CEQA proceeding. "
120,7," Use of the Thomas Expert Report is not impermissible for the purpose of suggesting the frivolousness of Cole's CEQA 
objection. Defendants do not currently suggest or argue that Thomas will not be able to testify at trial regarding her opinion that 
Cole's objection was ""frivolous to CEQA practitioners."" (Thomas Expert Rpt. 36-37); see Burch, 433 F. Supp. 2d at 1120. 
Moreover, and in any case, Relevant, in its opposition papers, sufficiently engages with the details of the objection itself to 
explain to the Court why the objection was frivolous, and Defendants fail to eliminate the legal possibility that Cole's objection 
was frivolous. "
123,8," This Court has already cautioned the Sunset Defendants regarding their use of incomplete quotations to make points of 
dubious merit. (First Mot. Dismiss Order 16, ECF No. 39 (""Parties are cautioned that this Court shall not tolerate . . . the use of 
ellipses to mischaracterize statements."").) "
127,9," The reasoning in footnote 3, supra, applies equally to the use of the Thomas Expert Report in this context. "
128,10," Several of Relevant's objections go to emails and texts containing settlement discussions and are raised on hearsay grounds. 
These objections are OVERRULED because Relevant fails to point to any particular assertion in the emails and texts that 
Defendants offer for its truth. The material in the emails reveals the course of the parties' settlement discussions and consists 
primarily of opinions, offers, and other legally operative language, not assertions of facts Defendants claim to be true. "
129,11," The Court finds that the Sunset Defendant's argument that Relevant lacks standing utterly lacks any basis and is borderline 
frivolous. (S. Mem. 24-25.) "
133,12," Based on Relevant's Notice of Motion, it is not clear whether Relevant further seeks summary judgment on any release-based 
issues that would be Relevant's burden to bear at trial. To the extent it does, it does not successfully demonstrate a lack of 
genuine dispute as to those issues, and summary judgment is denied to that extent. "
136,1," Retail mortgage lenders, on the other hand, work directly with borrowers ""from the beginning, including providing loan 
applications and collecting completed loan applications, performing income verification and collecting other required 
documentation, as well as quoting interest rates."" AC ¶ 4."
136,2, Citations to page numbers in the record are to the CM/ECF pagination.
136,3," The Court refers to the allegation by plaintiffs that defendants forced a choice between working with UWM or Rocket and 
Fairway to secure mortgages as ""the ultimatum."" By doing so, however, the Court does not imply the alleged conduct was illegal. 
Instead, I use the term ultimatum because it is the descriptor given by plaintiff and, at this stage, the Court must accept well-
pleaded allegations as true. See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 677, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009). "
137,4," The Florida legislature has adopted the antitrust law developed by the federal courts under the Sherman Act. All Care Nursing

Florida antitrust laws are analyzed under the same rules and case law.""). As a result, my analysis of federal antitrust law in 
section III, A-C, applies equally to alleged violations of the Florida Antitrust Act, Fla. Stat. § 542.18 (counts IV, V, and VI)."
137,5," Plaintiff does not specify what body of law applies to its tortious interference claim, but when read in tandem with the rest of the 
amended complaint and plaintiff's response to the motion to dismiss, it is evident plaintiff intended Florida law to apply. "
139,6," In Simpson, the plaintiff entered a consignment agreement with the defendant requiring it to charge a minimum price for 
gasoline. Plaintiff sold gas at a disallowed price, the defendant terminated the agreement, and plaintiff sued. 377 U.S. at 16. The 
Supreme Court reversed summary judgment for the defendant, finding the restriction on plaintiff's ability to make independent, 
competitive pricing decisions was an ""actionable wrong."" Id. It also noted that ""if the 'consignment' agreement achieves resale 
price maintenance in violation of the Sherman Act, it and the lease are being used to injure interstate commerce by depriving 
independent dealers of the exercise of free judgment whether to become consignees at all, or remain consignees, and in any 
event, to sell at competitive prices."" Id. "
140,7," I note that plaintiff's theory of relief evidenced in parts of its response, doc. 58, presumes UWM directs marketing and 
advertising directly to borrowers; but no such allegation is explicitly made in the amended complaint, although the 
announcement at issue is viewable by the public on Facebook."
140,8," See, e.g., AC ¶¶ 30-32 (alleging Ishbia falsely accused Fairway and Rocket of various wrongs to justify mortgage brokers to 
acquiesce to his ultimatum). "
142,9, Defendants make no argument based on these factors. 
144,10," Rule 8(a)(2) requires a pleading contain ""a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief . 
. . ."" Complaints that do not comply with Rule 8(a)(2) ""are often disparagingly referred to as 'shotgun pleadings.'"" Weiland v. 
Palm Beach Cnty. Sheriff's Off., 792 F.3d 1313, 1320 (11th Cir. 2015); see also Barmapov v. Amuial, 986 F.3d 1321, 1324 (11th 
Cir. 2021) (discussing shotgun pleadings). A shotgun pleading fails ""to give the defendants adequate notice of the claims against 
them and the grounds upon which each claim rests."" Weiland, 792 F.3d at 1323. There are four types of shotgun pleadings, and 
the amended complaint here falls into three of the four prohibited categories. The first type of shotgun pleading, ""contain[s] multiple counts where each count adopts the allegations of all preceding counts, 
causing each successive count to carry all that came before and the last count to be a combination of the entire complaint."" 
Barmapov, 986 F.3d at 1324-25 (quoting Weiland, 792 F.3d at 1321). Plaintiff here uses such a tactic, with each count repeating 
and realleging all paragraphs that came before it ""as if fully set forth herein."" See AC ¶¶ 69, 83, 93, 103, 116,126, 136, 149, 159. The second type is one ""replete with conclusory, vague, and immaterial facts not obviously connected to any particular cause of 
action."" Barmapov, 986 F.3d at 1325 (quoting Weiland, 792 F.3d at 1322). Here, plaintiff's amended complaint teems with vague 
and conclusory facts and repeated use of antitrust jargon such as ""group boycott,"" ""naked horizontal boycott,"" and ""hub-and-
spoke conspiracy,"" without sufficient explanation of their operation, meanings, or application here. The unorganized and frequent "
145,," use of these terms and phrases made analysis here particularly challenging. I have undertaken my analysis, however, mindful of 
my obligation to construe the complaint broadly and in the light most favorable to plaintiff. Levine v. World Fin. Network Nat'l 
Bank, 437 F.3d 1118 (11th Cir. 2006). The fourth type ""assert[s] multiple claims against multiple defendants without specifying which of the defendants are responsible 
for which acts or omissions, or which of the defendants the claim is brought against."" Barmapov, 986 F.3d at 1325 (alteration in 
original) (quoting Weiland, 792 F.3d at 1323). The amended complaint here treats UWM and Ishbia as the same, and does not 
separately allege Ishbia committed individual counts. This practice is impermissible. ""A district court has the inherent authority to . . . dismiss a complaint on shotgun pleading grounds."" Vibe Miko, Inc. v. 
Shabanets, 878 F.3d 1291, 1295 (11th Cir. 2018) (citing Weiland, 792 F.3d at 1320); see also Lumley v. City of Dade City, Fla., 
327 F.3d 1186, 1192 n.13 (11th Cir. 2003) (""When faced with [a shotgun] pleading, the district court, acting on its own initiative, 
[may] require a repleader""). Considering Weiland, and for the reasons stated in this recommendation, plaintiff's complaint 
appears to be a shotgun pleading. Should the Court allow plaintiff to file a second amended complaint, I suggest plaintiff 
separate its theories of relief under Section One of the Sherman Act into separate counts, so it is clear what facts it alleges 
support the individual theories it asserts. "
148,11," I do not, however, imply that a rimless hub-and-scope conspiracy may never restrain trade. In re Musical Instruments and 
Equip. Antitrust Litig., 798 F.3d 1186, 1192 n.3 (9th Cir. 2015). Rather, it is the mode of analysis affected by a lack of horizontal 
agreement. ""One key difference between a rimless hub-and-spoke conspiracy (i.e., a collection of purely vertical agreements) 
and a rimmed hub-and-spoke conspiracy (i.e., a collection of vertical agreements joined by horizontal agreements): courts 
analyze vertical agreements under the rule of reason, . . . whereas horizontal agreements are violations per se."" Id. (citations 
omitted)."
148,12," ""Group boycotts"" are also called ""concerted refusals to deal."" "
149,13," I do so because this assumption follows my duty to view the allegations in the light most favorable to plaintiff. See, e.g., AC ¶ 6 
(alleging that as of March 31, 2020, ""mortgage lending originating through independent brokers [like plaintiff] controlled [only] 
15.8 percent of residential loan originations in the United States[.])"" ""Many antitrust cases turn on the precise definition of this 
market, as defendants contest whether they possess market power or whether the restraint at issue affected the market as a 
whole."" Spanish Broad. Sys. of Fla., Inc. v. Clear Channel Commc'ns, Inc., 376 F.3d 1065, 1074 (11th Cir. 2004). "
152,14," . The Eleventh Circuit explained that ""injury to a competitor need not always result in injury to competition. The use of unfair 
means resulting in the substitution of one competitor for another without more does not violate the antitrust laws."" Spanish 
Broad. Sys., 376 F.3d at 1076 (citing Mfg. Research Corp. v. Greenlee Tool Co., 693 F.2d 1037, 1043 (11th Cir. 1982)). Even if the ultimatum qualified as ""unfair means,"" id., it is not clear from the amended complaint that defendants' actions had or 
could have an anticompetitive effect to the market or competition in general. AC ¶¶ 11-12. It appears, rather, that plaintiff has 
""merely alleged an attempt to eliminate two firms from the market rather than injury to competition."" "
153,15," As I have explained, plaintiff's theories of relief are difficult to parse out. I read count VII as based, at least in part, on the claim 
that defendants interfered with plaintiff's relationship with Rocket and Fairway. The count thus fails. "
154,16," The Court does not reach the question of whether plaintiff stated a claim for declaratory relief under count IX for the same 
reason."
154,17," I note, however, that I maintain some reservations as to whether plaintiff has sufficiently plead damages for the FDUPTA 
claim. See Casa Dimitri Corp. v. Invicta Watch Co. of Am., Inc., 270 F. Supp. 3d 1340, 1352 (S.D. Fla. 2017) (citations and 
quotations omitted) (explaining the element of ""actual damages"" is a ""term of art"" that does not include ""consequential

another party's objections within 14 days after being served with a copy."" Id. A party's failure to serve and file specific objections

157,1," For similar reasons, the Court is not assisted by Defendants' reference to Chavez v. Whirlpool Corp., 93 Cal. App. 4th 363 
(2001), which held that ""conduct that the courts have determined to be permissible under the Colgate doctrine cannot be 
deemed 'unfair' under the unfair competition law."" Defendants' cases do not demonstrate that their conduct was ""permissible."" "
171,1," The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation transferred this case from the District of New Jersey to the District of Kansas for 
coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings. We have jurisdiction to hear Sanofi's appeal because the right to appeal 
ripened when the district court granted summary judgment on Sanofi's sole claim, ""not upon eventual completion of multidistrict 
proceedings in all of the consolidated cases."" Gelboim v. Bank of Am. Corp., 574 U.S. 405, 408, 135 S. Ct. 897, 190 L. Ed. 2d 
789 (2015)."
171,2," In outlining the facts, we borrow language without indication from the district court's excellent Memorandum and Order. In re 
EpiPen (Epinephrine Injection, USP) Mktg., Sales Practices & Antitrust Litig., 507 F. Supp. 3d 1289 (D. Kan. 2020). Record and "

180,5," Sanofi details Mylan's rebate negotiations and agreements with Humana but we do not see how they are relevant. Mylan 
successfully blocked Auvi-Q on Humana's Medicare formularies by doubling the rebate offer from 5% to 10% in 2013, and then 
increasing it to 14% in 2014. But Humana never excluded Auvi-Q on its commercial formularies. No one explicitly defines the 
relevant market in this case, but it appears to be, based on the arguments presented, the commercial U.S. market for 
epinephrine auto-injectors. Humana's exclusion of Auvi-Q on its Medicare formularies is, therefore, wholly irrelevant. "
182,6," Some evidence relied upon by the district court in granting summary judgment is absent from the record on appeal. Because 
the parties did not object to the use of that evidence, we perfect the record by taking judicial notice of the missing facts. See St. 
Louis Baptist Temple, Inc. v. FDIC, 605 F.2d 1169, 1172 (10th Cir. 1979). "
186,7," There is some law in the Third Circuit suggesting ""in the context of exclusive dealing, the price-cost test may be utilized as a 
specific application of the 'rule of reason' when the plaintiff alleges that price is the vehicle of exclusion."" ZF Meritor, 696 F.3d at 
273 (citing Concord Boat Corp. v. Brunswick Corp., 207 F.3d 1039, 1060-63 (8th Cir. 2000)); id. at 320-24, 344 (Greenberg, J., 
dissenting); Eisai, Inc. v. Sanofi Aventis U.S., LLC, 821 F.3d 394, 408-09 (3d Cir. 2016). HN16[
] The Supreme Court 
developed the price-cost test to analyze predatory-pricing claims. See Brooke Grp. Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 
509 U.S. 209, 222-27, 113 S. Ct. 2578, 125 L. Ed. 2d 168 (1993). A predatory-pricing plaintiff must prove: (1) the rival's low 
prices ""are below an appropriate measure of its rival's costs,"" and (2) the rival had a ""dangerous probability[] of recouping its 
investment in below-cost prices."" Id. Sanofi does not dispute that it cannot pass the price-cost test. Mylan urges us to affirm on this basis, but its briefing is too cursory for us to do so. See Br. of Appellees 66. Even within the ZF 
Meritor panel there was substantial disagreement about when the price-cost test is the appropriate rule of reason analysis for 
exclusive dealing contracts. Mylan's two paragraphs of briefing are insufficient for us to determine whether the Third Circuit's 
approach is correct and how it should apply in this case. We leave for another day whether, in the Tenth Circuit, the pricecost 
test is the appropriate rule of reason analysis where ""a firm uses a single-product loyalty discount or rebate to compete with 
similar products."" Eisai, 821 F.3d at 409. We, therefore, choose to apply the full rule of reason analysis to Mylan's exclusive 
rebate agreements. This approach is consistent with Third Circuit precedent—which merits close consideration in this case—
because ZF Meritor clearly states the pricecost test ""may be utilized as a specific application of the 'rule of reason.'"" 696 F.3d at 
273. "
187,8," Introducing a consumer choice framework, even as a supplement to the consumer welfare standard, may inappropriately re-
entangle the courts in what Judge Bork called the ""antitrust paradox."" See Bork, supra, at 79-89. "
189,9," We think the district court's use of the ZF Meritor seven-factor test was appropriate given our case-specific deference to the 
Third Circuit. Although our analysis today does not directly reference ZF Meritor's factors, it follows the same general principles. 
These principles are: There is no set formula for evaluating the legality of an exclusive dealing agreement, but modern antitrust law generally 
requires a showing of (1) significant market power by the defendant, [**62]  (2) substantial foreclosure, (3) contracts of 
sufficient duration to prevent meaningful competition by rivals, and (4) an analysis of likely or actual anticompetitive effects 
considered in light of any procompetitive effects. Courts will also consider (5) whether there is evidence that the dominant 
firm engaged in coercive behavior, and (6) the ability of customers to terminate the agreements. (7) The use of exclusive 
dealing by competitors of the defendant is also sometimes considered. ZF Meritor, 696 F.3d at 271-72 (cleaned up)."
189,10," HN28[
] Section 1 of the Sherman Act makes ""[e]very contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States"" illegal. 15 U.S.C. § 1. Exclusive dealing can be challenged under 
both § 1 and § 2. See, e.g., ZF Meritor, 696 F.3d at 267 (challenging defendant's exclusive deals under both § 1 and § 2). For 
background on how the exclusive dealing analysis sometimes differs under § 1 and § 2, see 1 Antitrust Section, ABA, Antitrust 
Law Developments § 2C-2-b (9th ed. 2022). "
190,11," Sanofi tries to downplay the significance of its clear success by suggesting PBMs ""might experiment at the margins, excluding 
EpiPen from their smallest and most highly managed formularies,"" but ""none would dare block EpiPen from a major formulary."" 
Appellant's Opening Br. 39-40. But the summary judgment record undercuts Sanofi's assertion. For example, in 2015, ESI 
initially decided to reverse exclusion and exclude EpiPen in favor of Auvi-Q on its national formulary. In re EpiPen, 507 F. Supp. 
3d at 1321. ESI only reversed course after further analysis uncovered it could decrease the cost per prescription for both EpiPen 
and Auvi-Q without excluding EpiPen. Id. And CVS used its exclusion of EpiPen on its Advanced Control Formulary as ""a trial 
balloon of sorts."" Id. at 1324. After hearing ""no noise or complaints"" arising from EpiPen's exclusion, CVS projected that it could 
exclude EpiPen in favor of Auvi-Q on its national formulary. Id. "
192,12," The term ""rational"" and ""irrational"" are economic terms. Doctors that act ""irrationally"" may nevertheless act, in the eyes of 
society, appropriately or reasonably. See, e.g., Richard A. Posner, Economic Analysis of Law § 1.1 (9th ed. 2014). "
193,13," The district court reviewed this evidence under the deceptive speech doctrine. In re EpiPen, 507 F. Supp. 3d at 1360-61. That 
analysis is clearly correct. Our present analysis is only meant to address Sanofi's use of the advertisements to argue for 
recognition of spillover foreclosure. "
194,14," This does not mean that exclusive dealing arrangements instigated by the monopolist cannot be procompetitive or that 
exclusive dealing arrangements instigated by the customer cannot be anticompetitive."
194,15," We have no occasion to decide whether this logic applies equally to customer-instigated exclusive dealing by non-end users 
(like distributors). "
196,16," Sanofi cites some stray documents where PBMs, for example, ""reported being held 'hostage' by Mylan's exclusionary offers."" 
Appellant's Opening Br. 69. But these isolated, informal, out-of-court remarks in a record of 13,680 pages are insufficient for a 
jury to find Mylan coerced PBMs. HN38[
] ""The mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the plaintiff's position"" will 
not preclude summary judgment. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252. "
197,17," We have reasons to be skeptical of the viability of this strategy as a method of coercion. Raising a drug's list price can expose 
the manufacturer to congressional scrutiny and serious legal repercussions. See Toni Clarke, U.S. Lawmakers Blast Mylan CEO 
Over 'Sickening' EpiPen Price Hikes, Reuters (Sept. 21, 2016), https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mylan-nl-epipen-congress-
idUSKCN11R2OG. For example, Martin Shkreli was recently banned for life from the pharmaceutical drug industry because of his role in hiking the 
price of the drug Daraprim. Dan Mangan, Pharma Bro Martin Shkreli Banned for Life from Drug Industry in Monopoly Case, 
Ordered to Pay $64.6 Million, CNBC (Jan. 14, 2022), https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/14/pharma-bro-martin-shkreli-banned-for-
life-from-drug-industry-ordered-to-pay-64point6-million.html. And if Mylan increased EpiPen's price to trigger tighter formulary 
controls, PBMs could punish Mylan by eating higher prices for a competitor or they could retaliate against Mylan in other 
therapeutic classes. "
198,18," EpiPen's entrenched share arises either because (a) consumers preferred EpiPen to Auvi-Q, or (b) consumers exhibited 
something called status quo bias—that is, even though they might have preferred Auvi-Q in the abstract, they viewed any switch 
from a familiar-but-inferior product to an unfamiliar-but-superior product as an unacceptable loss. See William Samuelson & 
Richard Zeckhauser, Status Quo Bias in Decision Making, 1 J. Risk & Uncertainty 7 (1988); see also Daniel Kahneman, Jack L. 
Knetsch & Richard H. Thaler, Anomalies: The Endowment Effect, Loss Aversion, and Status Quo Bias, 5 J. Econ. Persp. 193, 
197-99 (1991) (""[I]ndividuals have a strong tendency to remain at the status quo, because the disadvantages of leaving it loom 
larger than advantages.""). See generally Daniel Kahneman & Amos Tversky, Prospect Theory: An Analysis of Decision Under "
199,," Risk, 47 Econometrica 263 (1979). This latter explanation is a specific theory of behavioral economics. We neither reject nor 
endorse the application of behavioral economics to antitrust analysis."
199,19," Although Sanofi focuses on Mylan's exclusive rebate offers, its theory cannot be limited to this situation. Following Sanofi's 
logic, its theory would apply any time an entrenched monopolist offers loyalty discounts conditioned on sales exceeding the 
entrenched portion of the market."
199,20," We can affirm the grant of summary judgment ""on any ground supported by the record, so long as the appellant has had a fair 
opportunity to address that ground."" Lincoln v. BNSF Ry. Co., 900 F.3d 1166, 1180 (10th Cir. 2018) (quoting Alpine Bank v. 
Hubbell, 555 F.3d 1097, 1108 (10th Cir. 2009)). At oral argument, Sanofi was asked to clarify what substantive legal standard 
ought to apply to Mylan's alleged leveraging of entrenched share. Because Sanofi failed to do so, we can affirm the grant of 
summary judgment on the basis of ""materiality."" See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a)."
199,21," We need not determine whether Sanofi's theory actually persists in practice. For the purposes of this case, it is sufficient to 
examine Sanofi's theory in the abstract. To generalize Sanofi's theory, assume a distributor needs to buy 10 widgets. Two 
manufacturers, Firm A and Firm B, sell slightly differentiated widgets at the same price. For 70% of the distributor's customers, 
they require Firm A's widgets (entrenched demand). The other 30% of customers are indifferent between Firm A's or Firm B's 
widgets (non-entrenched demand). If Firm A offered the distributor a 10% rebate conditioned on the distributor buying all ten 
units from it, Firm B would need to offer a 33.3% rebate on each widget to make the distributor indifferent between (a) buying 
exclusively Firm A's widgets or (b) buying seven widgets from Firm A, and three from Firm B. The entrenched monopolist's use of loyalty discounts might make it harder for a rival to compete for the non-entrenched portion 
of the market, but we cannot immediately discern any reduction in consumer welfare from this situation because the loyalty 
discounts lower aggregate prices. See, e.g., Klein & Murphy, supra, at 450 (explaining that ex ante competition for exclusive or 
preferred formulary placement ""will substantially lower the pharmaceutical manufacturers' prices""); Hearings, supra, at 13 (""The 
way you get low prices in the pharmaceutical industry is by the ability to exclude drugs."" (statement of Dr. Scott Morton)); Bork, 
supra, at 137 (""All business activity excludes. . . . Antitrust, therefore, must be able to distinguish [proper and beneficial] 
efficiency exclusion from improper exclusion.""). ""By adopting exclusivity, a [PBM] can be thought of as acting as the bargaining "
200,," agent for all its loyal consumers, so they are made better off as a group. If, alternatively, the [PBM covered] both brands and left 
it up to ex post competition between manufacturers to determine prices, consumers would have indulged their individual brand 
preferences and driven up prices for everyone."" Klein & Murphy, supra, at 452. Sanofi's briefing fails to answer the material 
question—whether Mylan's use of loyalty rebates hurt or threatened to hurt consumers—and instead answers an immaterial 
one—whether Mylan's use of loyalty rebates hurt or threatened to hurt a competitor. Brunswick, 429 U.S. at 488 (""The antitrust 
laws, however, were enacted for 'the protection of competition not competitors.'"" (quoting Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, 370 
U.S. 294, 320, 82 S. Ct. 1502, 8 L. Ed. 2d 510 (1962))); see, e.g., Novell, 731 F.3d at 1072; Crum & Forster, 682 F.2d at 663-64; 
Bork, supra, at 61."
200,22," HN42[
] The entrenched monopolist's use of loyalty discounts may be procompetitive or competitively neutral, Kobayashi, 
supra, at 117, 121-22, which necessarily means a per se rule is inappropriate. E.g., Leegin, 551 U.S. at 886-87. We should not, 
after all, deter the entrenched monopolist's use of loyalty discounts if it would lead to lower consumer prices and higher welfare. 
See FTC v. Church & Dwight Co., Inc., 665 F.3d 1312, 1316-17, 398 U.S. App. D.C. 449 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (D. Ginsburg, J.) 
(collecting criticism of the LePage's decision because it condemns behavior which does not obviously reduce, and may even 
promote, consumer welfare); cf. Timothy J. Muris & Vernon L. Smith, Antitrust and Bundled Discounts: An Experimental 
Analysis, 75 Antitrust L.J. 399, 403 (2008) (discussing experiments in the analogous context of bundling which showed that 
""even when competitors are excluded, such exclusion does not reduce long-run average consumer or total surplus"")."
200,23," We worry about the administrability of this test. To determine prospectively whether its loyalty rebates would offend the 
discount-attribution test, the entrenched firm must calculate the entrenched share before applying the aggregate discounts to the 
non-entrenched share. But entrenched share based upon consumer preference is impossible to calculate with any objective 
precision. On a cold and complete record, Dr. Scott Morton (former Deputy Assistant Attorney General for Economic Analysis) 
can only guess that EpiPen's entrenched share was somewhere between 50%-70%. This is too imprecise. Without an 
administrable test of liability, the entrenched monopolist would never risk offering loyalty rebates even if it would bring about 
increased consumer welfare. See Bos. Edison Co., 915 F.2d at 22. We are uncomfortable with such a result because, as then-
Judge Breyer observed, ""we must be concerned lest a rule or precedent that authorizes a search for a particular type of 
undesirable pricing behavior end up by discouraging legitimate price competition."" Barry Wright, 724 F.2d at 234; see also, e.g., 
Easterbrook, supra, at 2 (""If the court errs by condemning a beneficial practice, the benefits may be lost for good. Any other firm 
that uses the condemned practice faces sanctions in the name of stare decisis, no matter the benefits."")."
200,24," For some background, Dr. Scott Morton quantified EEB as: EEB = (exclusionary rebate %) x (share with exclusion) / (contestable share) The basic theory is when EEB is high, the defendant's loyalty rebate scheme is anticompetitive. EEB is higher when the loyalty 
rebate is high (i.e., Mylan is offering lower prices) and when non-entrenched demand is low (i.e., when customers prefer 
EpiPen). Thus, Dr. Scott Morton's test is an inadequate proxy for consumer welfare because EEB will generally punish a firm for 
offering better prices or having the preferred product. We are unsure whether we can consider the EEB test as a potential legal standard since the district court excluded Dr. Scott 
Morton's EEB test in a contemporaneously-filed Daubert opinion—a disposition Sanofi does not challenge on appeal. This is a 
thorny question which we are not going to entangle ourselves in. Assuming we could adopt the EEB test as a legal standard, it 
does not change our analysis. Sanofi never proposed a substantive legal standard on appeal, preventing us from determining 
whether Mylan's alleged leveraging of entrenched demand presents a ""material"" question of fact. "
201,25," The EEB test suffers the same administrability problems as the discount-attribution test—it relies upon the extent of 
entrenched share which is difficult to objectively derive. See supra note 23."
201,26," The downside to the price-cost test is that it may not, when compared to another standard, catch as many anticompetitive 
uses of loyalty discounts by an entrenched monopolist. But the price-cost test has some benefits. First, the price-cost test limits 
the risk of false condemnation for welfare-enhancing price competition and does not discourage ""legitimate price competition."" 
Barry Wright, 724 F.2d at 234; Bos. Edison Co., 915 F.2d at 22 (""[Antitrust rules] must be designed with the knowledge that firms 
ultimately act, not in precise conformity with the literal language of complex rules, but in a reaction to what they see as the likely 
outcome of court proceedings.""); see, e.g., Brooke Grp., 509 U.S. at 223; Klein & Murphy, supra, at 444-48; Easterbrook, supra, 
at 15-17; cf. Muris & Smith, supra, at 403. Second, the price-cost test is objectively (and prospectively) administrable—unlike 
any test dependent on the extent of entrenched consumer preference. See Richard M. Steuer, Musthavedness, 81 Antitrust L.J. 
447, 460-61 (2017); supra notes 23, 25. Third, because the price-cost test is easier to administer, it results in reduced costs of 
administration. See, e.g., Easterbrook, supra, at 12-13, 16 (""Litigation costs are the product of vague rules combined with high 
stakes, and nowhere is that combination more deadly than in antitrust litigation.""). Fourth, the price-cost test, because it is 
unlikely to disincentivize the use of loyalty rebates by an entrenched firm, will not inadvertently encourage collusion in the 
market. See Trinko, 540 U.S. at 408; Barry Wright, 724 F.2d at 235 (""Price cutting in concentrated industries seems sufficiently 
difficult to stimulate that we hesitate before embracing a rule that could, in practice, stabilize 'tacit cartels' and further encourage 
interdependent pricing behavior.""); Novell, 731 F.3d at 1073. "
202,27," In discussing Mylan's EpiPen4Schools program, Sanofi might be trying to make an additional argument by using the vogue 
antitrust buzzword: ""network effects."" E.g., Appellant's Opening Br. 56. ""In markets characterized by network effects, one 
product or standard tends towards dominance, because 'the utility that a user derives from consumption of the good increases 
with the number of other agents consuming the good.'"" Microsoft, 253 F.3d at 49 (quoting Michael L. Katz & Carl Shapiro, 
Network Externalities, Competition, and Compatibility, 75 Am. Econ. Rev. 424, 424 (1985)). But see id. (""In technologically 
dynamic markets, however, such entrenchment may be temporary, because innovation may alter the field altogether."" (citing 
Joseph A. Schumpeter, Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy 81-90 (Harper Perennial 1976) (1942))). Sanofi argues the 
difference in administration of EpiPen and Auvi-Q created network effects in the epinephrine auto-injector industry. Patients 
receive additional utility from carrying the device that a greater proportion of the population carries because there is an increased 
chance that a bystander would properly administer the patient's device in an emergency. See, e.g., Appellant's Opening Br. 20 
(""And with 30 years of market dominance, EpiPen had cultivated a 'network' of teachers, neighbors, and school nurses trained 
exclusively to swing and jab.""). The problem is ""there is no consensus among commentators on the question of whether, and to what extent, current 
monopolization doctrine should be amended to account for"" network effects. Microsoft, 253 F.3d at 50; see, e.g., Michael L. Katz 
& Carl Shapiro, Systems Competition and Network Effects, 8 J. Econ. Persp. 93, 113 (1994) (""[W]e are far from having a general 
theory of when government intervention is preferable to the unregulated market outcome.""). We cannot reach any argument 
pertaining to network effects because Sanofi's offhand use of the term does not satisfy its obligation to provide us with its 
""contentions and reasons for them."" Fed. R. App. P. 28(a)(8)(A); Exum v. U.S. Olympic Comm., 389 F.3d 1130, 1133 n.4 (10th 
Cir. 2004) (""Scattered statements in the appellant's brief are not enough to preserve an issue for appeal.""). With such substantial 
disagreement about the proper role of network effects in antitrust analysis, Sanofi's obligation was to brief us on the proper role 
of network effects in our analysis. Sanofi's failure to do so constitutes waiver of that argument."
202,28," We note that something feels suspect about permitting a private plaintiff to bring a monopolization claim when the alleged 
misconduct derives from the defendant defrauding the government. "
203,29," Sanofi also appeals the district court's alternative and independently sufficient basis for summary judgment [**104]  that ""no 
reasonable jury could find that Mylan's conduct produced an antitrust injury."" In re EpiPen, 507 F. Supp. 3d at 1366. Given our 
previous analysis, we need not decide the issue of antitrust injury. ""When a court concludes that no [antitrust] violation has 
occurred, it has no occasion to consider [antitrust injury]."" Levine v. Cent. Fla. Med. Affiliates, Inc., 72 F.3d 1538, 1545 (11th Cir. 
1996) (quoting 2A Areeda & Hovenkamp, supra, ¶ 335f, at 101); accord Doctor's Hosp. of Jefferson, Inc. v. Se. Med. All., Inc., 
123 F.3d 301, 306 (5th Cir. 1997); Hairston v. Pac. 10 Conference, 101 F.3d 1315, 1318 (9th Cir. 1996). "
204,1," The Holding Company Defendants also ""adopt by reference the memorandum of law filed by the Varsity Defendants."" (ECF 
No. 60-1 at PageID 348, n.2 (referencing ECF No. 59-1).) The Court will address those arguments in a separate Order. Here, "
205,," the Court only addresses the arguments raised by these Defendants in their Motion, which focuses on their liability under §§1 
and 2 of the Sherman Act."
205,2," This recitation of facts is based on Plaintiffs' Complaint, (ECF No. 1), assumed to be true for purposes of this Order."
205,3," Varsity Brands, LLC, Varsity Spirit, LLC, Varsity Spirit Fashion & Supplies, LLC are collectively referred to by Plaintiffs as 
""Varsity,"" which the Court will employ as well. "
207,4," Historically, equitable relief — a portion of what Plaintiffs allege under the Sherman Act — is not controlled by statutes of 
limitations. See States v. Am. Elec. Power Serv. Corp., 137 F.Supp.2d 1060, 1067-68 (S.D. Ohio 2001) (citing Hommberg v. 
Armbrecht, 327 U.S. 392, 396 (1946) ("". . . statute of limitations historically do not control measures of equitable relief."")). 
However, when there are concurrent legal and equitable remedies sought, ""equity will withhold its relief [] where the applicable 
statute of limitations would bar the concurrent legal remedy."" Sierra Club v. Dayton Power & Light, Inc., No. 2:04cv905, 2005 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 42473, 2005 WL 1972549, at *4 (S.D. Ohio Aug. 12, 2005). Thus, to the extent Plaintiffs seek equitable relief 
for claims otherwise barred by the statute of limitations, the equitable claims are also barred by the concurrent remedy doctrine. "
208,5, These Defendants do not argue that USASF and Varsity are a single entity. 
210,6," Defendants also argue that both Charlesbank and Bain are holding companies that have ""indirectly own[ed] the Varsity 
Defendants,"" (ECF No. 60-1 at PageID 348), but this is not found anywhere in Plaintiffs' Complaint, which controls the factual 
background at this stage. Thus, taking Plaintiffs' allegations as true for purposes of this Order, the Court will consider that 
Charlesbank ""wholly owned Varsity Brands LLC from 2014 to 2018, and that Bain ""purchased defendant Varsity Brands, LLC in 
2018"" and owned it at the time that this lawsuit was filed. (ECF No. 1 at PageID 8.)"
210,7," In the Complaint, Plaintiffs state that Varsity ""continued to acquire . . . competitors in the Cheer Competition Market,"" including 
Team Epic Brands, in 2016-17. (ECF No. 1 at PageID 24.) However, Plaintiffs also state that this acquisition was not complete 
until January 2018. (Id. at PageID 26.) Based on this information, this acquisition could have occurred during the period of Bain's 
ownership. "
211,8," Plaintiffs' recovery for Defendants' violations of the Sherman Act — for instance, whether they share liability as an enterprise 
for violations or can be held separately and individually liable for any individual anticompetitive conduct — is not an issue to be 
determined at the motion to dismiss stage. Thus, this Order does not consider Plaintiffs' alternative theories for Defendants' 
liability, including agency liability and successor liability. "
221,1," This recitation of facts is based on the Indirect Purchasers' Complaint, (ECF No. 1), assumed to be true for the purposes of this 
Order. "
222,2," The Indirect Purchasers define ""Varsity"" as the collective term to represent Varsity Brands, LLC, Varsity Spirit, LLC, and Varsity 
Fashion & Supplies, LLC. (ECF No. 1 at PageID 4.) "
223,3," It is not clear that this failure to accommodate competitors is actionable under prevailing antitrust law, which generally does 
not require firms to share their advantage or resources with others. Because this allegation is not necessary to the resolution of 
this Motion, the Court will not discuss whether it could constitute an antitrust violation."
223,4," On April 6, 2022, the Court entered an Order Granting Plaintiffs' Unopposed Motion to Drop Party Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 21, 
(ECF No. 250), and instructed the Clerk of Court to remove Michelle Velotta from the docket as a named Plaintiff in the litigation. 
Thus, Jessica Jones and Christina Lorenzen are the remaining named Plaintiffs."
223,5," The ""Bid system"" operates under rules ""agreed to by Varsity and USASF,"" where Cheer teams must secure a Varsity Bid to 
attend ""most of Varsity or USASF's Championship competitions."" (ECF No. 1 at PageID 29.) Teams secure bids by attending 
and winning Varsity-owned and operated competitions. (Id.) "
224,6," Defendants Charlesbank and Bain's separate allegations are addressed in a separate Order. However, this Order incorporates 
the Court's previous conclusion that they are considered as a joint enterprise with Varsity regarding the Indirect Purchasers' 
Sherman Act claims against Varsity. (See ECF No. 332.) "
225,7," Under the Sherman Act, the language of § 3 ""is virtually the same as § 1's, but extends § 1's prohibitions to U.S. territories and 
the District of Columbia."" Robinson v. Jackson Hewitt, Inc., No. 19-9066 (SDW) (LDW), 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 188962, 2019 WL 
5617512, at *5, n.7 (D.N.J. Oct. 31, 2019). Thus, this Court will analyze Plaintiffs' § 1 and § 3 claims using the same standards."
225,8," Defendants also argue that the Indirect Purchasers cannot state a claim for unlawful ""bundling,"" or grouping discounts for 
different products under the Sherman Act. (ECF No. 59-1 at PageID 333.) However, the Indirect Purchasers allege improper 
exclusive dealing, not improper bundling. (See ECF No. 68 at PageID 436.) Thus, the Court will not discuss whether Defendants' 
conduct constitutes improper bundling."
225,9," HN4[
] Exclusionary contracts may also be considered as anticompetitive conduct in deciding claims under § 2 of the Sherman Act. LePage's Inc. v. 3M, 324 F.3d 141, 157 (3d Cir. 2003). Thus, the Court's analysis here also applies to Plaintiffs' § 
2 claims. "
227,10," This analysis also applies to the argument that Defendants are incapable of conspiring under § 2 of the Sherman Act due to 
the Copperweld doctrine. "
229,11," While the Sixth Circuit referenced a possibly higher standard to find an individual liable in Murphy Tugboat Co. v. Shipowners 
Merchs. Towboat Co., 467 F. Supp. 841, 852 (N.D. Cal. 1979), it did not explicitly adopt this higher standard, and neither have 
other lower courts in the Circuit. See In re Southeastern Milk Antitrust Litigation, 801 F. Supp. 2d 705 (E.D. Tenn. 2011); 
Churchill Downs Inc. v. Thoroughbred Horsemen's Grp., LLC, 605 F. Supp. 2d 870, 889 (W.D. Ky. 2009). "
231,12," The Indirect Purchasers also allege that there is a separate division of Competitive Cheer - ""Youth & Recreation Cheer"" - 
where teams affiliate with a recreational organization, like the YMCA, or do not have an affiliation. (ECF No. 1 at PageID 15.) 
However, because the Indirect Purchasers assert that Varsity controls only 10% of this market, they do not include the market in 
their claims. (Id.) "
235,13," The Order addressed exclusive dealing above, see supra Section I(A), and the Court does not reconsider it here. "
237,14," The Indirect Purchasers allege that their exclusionary scheme under § 2 of the Sherman Act involves Varsity, USASF, Webb, 
Bain, Charlesbank, and unnamed co-conspirators. (ECF No. 1 at PageID 4.) Further, the Indirect Purchasers describe the ""core 
Defendants"" as those including Webb, Varsity Brands, Varsity Spirit, Varsity Spirit Fashion, and USASF - all of whom were 
included in ""directing the Scheme."" (Id. at PageID 52.) Thus, while USASF and Webb are not specifically named in the claim for 
relief under § 2 of the Sherman Act in count 1, they are sufficiently alleged to be engaged in Varsity's exclusionary scheme and 
are thus liable under § 2 of the Sherman Act. "
238,15," Defendant Webb includes this argument in his Motion, (see ECF No. 58-1), and Varsity Defendants and Defendant USASF 
adopt his arguments in their Motions. "
239,16," Alabama, Arizona, the District of Columbia, Mississippi, Nevada, New York, North Carolina, South Dakota, West Virginia, and 
Wisconsin. (ECF No. 58-1 at PageID 300.)"
239,17," Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Illinois, and Utah. (ECF No. 58-1 at PageID 301.)"
239,18," California, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico, 
North Dakota, Oregon, and Rhode Island (the remaining states in Plaintiffs' complaint. (ECF No. 1 at PageID 10-11.) "
240,19," Ariz. Rev. Stat. §§ 44-1401, 1402 (requiring that the ""contract, combination or conspiracy between two or more persons in

South Dakota""); see also In re New Motor Vehicles Canadian Exp. Antitrust Litig., 350 F.Supp.2d 160, 172 (D.Me. 2004) 
(""plaintiffs need only allege that a part of the trade or commerce occurred within South Dakota""). "
241,20," Webb also argues that the Indirect Purchasers do not have a right of action under Utah law because they do not allege to be 
Utah citizens or residents, but Defendants' standing challenge under Utah law has already been considered and denied. See 
supra Section III(B)(1) at p.44. "
242,21," ""If a state law collides with a federal rule, we must determine whether the federal rule applies . . . per Justice Stevens's 
controlling concurrence in [Shady Grove]."" Albright v. Christensen, 24 F.4th 1039, 1044 (6th Cir. 2022). "
244,22," Webb also argues that the Indirect Purchasers fail to allege that Webb ""himself offers products or services,"" and thus that 
these claims should be dismissed as against him individually. (ECF No. 58-1 at PageID 304.) However, as discussed supra at 
Sections I(B)(2) and II(A), the Indirect Purchasers have sufficiently alleged that Webb can be held liable for actively participating 
in Varsity's corporate actions under antitrust laws."
244,23," USASF also challenges the provision under Colorado law, but, because the Indirect Purchasers did not respond, the Court 
already granted the Motion to Dismiss that claim. See supra Section III(B) at p.43. "
246,24," Defendant Varsity joins and incorporates the argument set forth by Defendant Webb challenging the Indirect Purchasers' state 
unjust enrichment claim."
246,25," Defendants do not challenge the last factor of the unjust enrichment claim, save for Varsity Defendants' general argument that 
if the Indirect Purchasers fail to state a claim under the federal antitrust laws, they fail to state a claim under the principles of 
unjust enrichment. (ECF No. 59 at PageID 325.) Therefore, considering Plaintiffs' assertion that ""[i]t would be wrong and 
inequitable for Varsity to be permitted to retain any of the illgotten gains from its wrongful monopolization scheme,"" (see ECF No. 
1 at PageID 60), the Court finds this factor satisfied. "
251,1," The following facts are taken from the CAC unless otherwise noted and are taken to be true for purposes of this motion. LaFaro 
v. New York Cardiothoracic Group, PLLC, 570 F.3d 471, 475 (2d Cir. 2009)."
251,2," ""Trade books"" is a term of art referring to ""general interest fiction and non-fiction books,"" distinguished from ""non-trade books"" 
like academic textbooks or reference materials. CAC ¶¶ 1, 114 (quoting United States v. Apple Inc., 952 F. Supp. 2d 638, 648 
n.4 (S.D.N.Y. 2013))."
251,3, HarperCollins also sells trade eBooks directly to consumers through its own website. CAC ¶ 2.
251,4," Plaintiffs' complaint includes numerous allegations concerning conduct by the Publishers that was the subject of two antitrust 
lawsuits—one commenced by the United States and 33 States, United States v. Apple, Inc., 791 F.3d 290 (2d Cir. 2015) and 
952 F. Supp. 2d 638 (S.D.N.Y. 2013), and a related class action for damages brought by individual consumers, In re Elec. Books 
Antitrust Litig. (""eBooks""), 639 F. App'x 724 (2d Cir. 2016). See, e.g., CAC ¶ 56 (referencing both actions). At various points 
throughout the CAC, Plaintiffs cite to decisions by the courts in those actions. "
258,5," Plaintiffs caption their First Cause of Action as a claim under Section 2 of the Sherman Act. See CAC, page 76. It is 
nevertheless apparent from the allegations pled in support of that claim that Plaintiffs are alleging a violation of Section 1 of the 
Sherman Act. Moreover, in addressing the First Cause of Action in their brief, Plaintiffs characterize the claim as raising a 
violation of Section 1. "
262,6," The consent decrees are referenced in the complaint and their terms were relied on by Plaintiffs in drafting the allegations in 
the complaint. CAC ¶¶ 57-58, 62, 78, 80, 100-01. For that reason, the consent decrees may be considered by the Court on this 
motion to dismiss. See Cortec Indus., Inc. v. Sum Holdings, 949 F.2d 42, 47 (2d Cir. 1991) (explaining that as part of a Rule 
12(b)(6) motion a court may consider any document incorporated by reference into the complaint)."
262,7, See [*45]  also CAC ¶ 53 (alleging that Google and Barnes & Noble had also adopted agency pricing). 
264,8," See In re Digital Music Antitrust Litig., 06-MD-1780 (LAP), Second Consolidated Amended Complaint, ¶¶ 106-07 (complaint in 
Starr alleging existence of investigations into all defendants' conduct). "
267,9," For this reason, Meyer v. Kalanick, 174 F. Supp. 3d 817 (S.D.N.Y. 2016), relied on by Plaintiffs (Br. at 16) is distinguishable. In 
Meyer, the allegations in the complaint suggested that the defendants would have had an opportunity to confer and reach 
agreement. See 174 F.3d at 821, 823, 825 (discussing allegations concerning meetings among the Uber drivers that suggested 
Uber drivers had ""many opportunities to meet"" and reach agreement); see also Meyer v. Kalanick, No. 15 Civ. 9796, Am. Compl.

270,10," See Pl.'s Br. 36 (arguing that ""because such price increases would result in loss of market share for any Publisher Defendant 
acting alone, this parallel pricing conduct reflects coordination among Publisher Defendants"")."
270,11," All of the cases cited by Plaintiffs are inapposite. Pl.'s Br. at 37-38, n.112. Standard Oil Co. v. United States, 337 U.S. 293, 
294-95, 69 S. Ct. 1051, 93 L. Ed. 1371 (1949), concerned ""exclusive supply contracts"" challenged under Section 3 of the 
Clayton Act. Likewise, United States v. Microsoft Corp., 253 F.3d 34, 68-70, 346 U.S. App. D.C. 330 (D.C. Cir. 2001), concerned 
""exclusive dealing agreements"" between Microsoft and various internet-access providers. Similarly, In re Keurig Green Mountain 
Single-Serve Coffee Antitrust Litig., 383 F. Supp. 3d 187, 245 (S.D.N.Y. 2019), concerned, in part, ""a concerted refusal to deal or 
group boycott."" Here, the CAC makes clear that the vertical agreements between Amazon and each Publisher did not preclude 
the Publishers from selling their own eBooks through other retail outlets or directly to consumers. See CAC ¶¶ 2, 18-19, 53. The 
vertical agreements here are thus unlike the exclusive dealing agreements at issue in the cases relied on by Plaintiffs because 
the agreements do not limit any Publisher's ability to sell its eBooks through retailers other than Amazon. Finally, Am. Express 
Co., 138 S. Ct. at 2288-90, does not address the question of whether one can aggregate market share to indirectly show market 
power."
270,12," Although the CAC alleges that the ""relevant market"" is ""the retail sale of trade eBooks in the United States"" (CAC ¶ 113), the 
CAC provides the collective market share of the Publishers in ""trade books,"" a category which also includes print books (CAC ¶¶ 
1, 115, 117, 166)."
270,13, The 14.4% figure is arrived at by multiplying Amazon's 90% market share by the 16% market share of an individual Publisher.

276,*, This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3. 
277,1," Characterizing the filing of a lawsuit as a new antitrust violation sufficient to restart the statute of limitations also seems at odds 
with the Noerr-Pennington doctrine, which provides that the filing of a lawsuit and other petitioning activity generally cannot 
constitute an antitrust violation. See Kearney v. Foley & Lardner, LLP, 590 F.3d 638, 643-44 (9th Cir. 2009). "
282,1," Of the two Defendants, only USF responded to the Motion to Remand. "

certain arguments from Mylan's motion. Doc. 135 at 10 n.4. And, Mylan ""incorporates"" certain arguments asserted by Pfizer's 
motion. Doc. 138 at 17, 29 n.12. The court addresses defendants' joint arguments together in the analysis, below."
289,2," The First Circuit has explained that a reverse payment settlement ""refers to an arrangement in which the brand-name

290,6, The original Complaint asserted similar allegations. See Doc. 1 at 80 (Comp. ¶ 246). 
291,7," Plaintiffs respond that the 78 cases defendants identify where Castillo is a plaintiff actually are just nine cases. See Doc. 145 at 
23 n.8 (explaining that 59 of the 78 listed cases are part of an MDL pending in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania). However 
one counts the cases, plaintiffs assert that Castillo's involvement in other litigation has no bearing on the question whether it 
brings viable claims here."
291,8," The parties don't cite—and the court's research hasn't revealed—any Tenth Circuit authority on this issue. The court predicts 
that the Circuit, if presented with this issue, would find the Eleventh Circuit's reasoning persuasive and also apply an objective 
standard to the injury notice question presented here. "
292,9," Defendants' cited cases apply this same standard to antitrust plaintiffs—i.e., an objective standard that considers whether 
plaintiffs had actual or constructive notice of their claims based on information available to it. See Hexcel Corp. v. Ineos 
Polymers, Inc., 681 F.3d 1055, 1061, 1064 (9th Cir. 2012) (affirming district court's use of ""the objective standard of actual or 
constructive notice, based on the record evidence before it"" to conclude that plaintiff's claims were time-barred because plaintiff 
""had knowledge of both the specific agreements and the industry-wide anticompetitive practices . . . more than a decade before 
the filing of its complaint""); see also Reveal Chat Holdco, LLC v. Facebook, Inc., 471 F. Supp. 3d 981, 993-94 (N.D. Cal. 2020) 
(concluding that plaintiffs ""had constructive knowledge of the facts that give rise to their claims"" because those facts ""were 
widely publicized"" in the media). "
294,10," Defendants also assert that plaintiffs never allege specific information that they learned from the Congressional announcement 
about an EpiPen pricing investigation that provided them notice of their generic delay claims. Defendants argue that ""nothing 
about that announcement had anything to do with the EpiPen or Nuvigil patent settlements or any supposed generic delay."" Doc. 
148 at 12. But, the court must view plaintiffs' factual allegations as true and in the light most favorable to them. And plaintiffs 
allege that the Congressional announcement was their first notice of defendants' alleged ""unlawful pricing practices"" and before 
August 22, 2016, plaintiffs didn't know about defendants' ""unlawful conduct to monopolize the EAI market"" or that ""they were 
paying supra-competitive prices for EpiPens during the Class Period as a result of [d]efendants' anticompetitive conduct."" Doc. 
128 at 61 (FAC ¶¶ 219, 222). Viewing these allegations in plaintiffs' favor, plaintiffs plainly have alleged that the Congressional 
announcement first provided them notice that they had paid supracompetitive prices for EpiPens—something that plaintiffs 
allege was a consequence of defendants' alleged unlawful reverse payment settlement delaying generic competition. 
Specifically, plaintiffs allege that defendants' generic delay forced them to pay overcharges for EpiPens that they would not have 
paid otherwise had a generic EpiPen entered the EAI market sooner. Id. at 58-59 (FAC ¶¶ 206, 208, 209, 211). Plaintiffs allege "
295,," that ""the Congressional investigation and information made public from it caused [p]laintiffs and [c]lass [m]embers to further 
investigate and inquire into the allegations"" about generic delay. Id. at 61-62 (FAC ¶ 222). They assert: ""Pharmaceutical antitrust 
claims are inherently complex, encompassing several areas of law;"" but nevertheless, ""[p]laintiffs and [c]lass [m]embers have 
been diligently researching their claims and investigating their damages since disclosure by the Congressional investigation."" Id. These allegations support a plausible finding or inference that plaintiffs couldn't have known about their claims before August 22, 
2016, because it wasn't until that date when they learned they were paying overcharges for their EpiPen purchases based on 
defendants' alleged monopolization of the market through certain conduct, including the generic delay alleged in this lawsuit. 
And, as already discussed, plaintiffs have alleged sufficiently that they could not have known or discovered by exercise of 
reasonable diligence that they had a generic delay claim because the information disclosed publicly about the Teva Settlement 
before August 22, 2016 was limited and—as plaintiffs allege—omitted material facts about the Settlement. "
298,11," Plaintiffs also allege that their claims are timely under a continuing violations theory. See Doc. 128 at 63 (FAC ¶ 229) (alleging 
that defendants' unlawful acts ""have created continuing and repeated injuries to [p]laintiffs and [c]lass members each time 
[p]laintiffs and [c]lass members have been or are overcharged for EpiPens""). Defendants disagree. They argue that the 
continuing violations doctrine doesn't apply to plaintiffs' claims because the FAC doesn't allege plausibly that defendants 
committed any unlawful conduct or that plaintiffs sustained any injury within the four years preceding the filing of this lawsuit. 
Doc. 135 at 24-26; Doc. 138 at 20-21. Because the court finds that plaintiffs have asserted timely claims by alleging plausibly 
that the discovery rule, fraudulent concealment, and equitable tolling apply to toll the statute of limitations, the court need not 
address the parties' arguments about the continuing violations doctrine. "
299,12," As the court already has noted, the ""original Complaint generally alleged the same four claims alleged by the SAC."" Doc. 113 
at 6. "
300,13," Defendants never explain how KPH's failure to comply with the McKesson contract's ADR obligation strips KPH of Article III 
standing. Instead, the contract's ADR obligation was a ""condition precedent"" that KPH was required to satisfy before filing suit. 
See, e.g., S'holder Representative Servs. LLC v. Shire US Holdings, Inc., No. 2017-0863-KSJM, 2020 Del. Ch. LEXIS 315, 2020 
WL 6018738, at *17 (Del. Ch. Oct. 12, 2020) (explaining under Delaware law that ""[w]here a contractual obligation is subject to a 
'condition precedent,' that obligation will only mature on satisfaction of a contractually specified condition""); see also Doc. 49 at 4 
n.3 (applying Delaware law to McKesson's ADR obligation). As one Florida court has noted, a plaintiff's ""standing to bring an 
action is distinct from questions arising from the claimant's noncompliance with one or more conditions precedent to maintaining 
the action."" See Progressive Express Ins. Co. v. McGrath Cmty. Chiropractic, 913 So.2d 1281, 1284 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2005) 
(describing a Florida Supreme Court case where failure to satisfy a condition precedent ""before filing the action was not a fatal 
jurisdictional defect requiring dismissal of the action"" but, instead, the court held plaintiff could satisfy the condition precedent 
""after filing the original complaint but before filing an amended complaint pleading compliance with"" the condition precedent 
(citing Holding Elec. Inc. v. Roberts, 530 So.2d 301 (Fla. 1988)). Here, KPH's failure to comply with the ADR obligation before 
filing suit doesn't render its original Complaint a ""nullity."" To the contrary, and as already described, KPH had Article III standing 
when it filed suit. KPH's failure to comply with the ADR obligation before filing suit is an argument going to the merits of its 
antitrust claims. But, it didn't divest KPH of Article III standing. "
302,14," Our court has recognized that ""[w]hile it is well established that Rule 15(c)(1)(C) applies to the addition of new defendants, 
courts are split as to whether and how it applies to the addition of new plaintiffs."" Pipeline Prods., Inc. v. Madison Cos., LLC, 428 
F. Supp. 3d 591, 603 (D. Kan. 2019) (citation omitted). But, as Pipeline Products notes, Rule 15's ""advisory notes state that 'the 
attitude taken in revised Rule 15(c) toward change of defendants extends by analogy to amendments changing plaintiffs.'"" Id. 
(quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c) advisory committee's note). Thus, ""most courts allow for the addition of both new defendants and 
new plaintiffs under Rule 15(c)(1)(C)."" Id. Although the Tenth Circuit hasn't decided this question, the court predicts that the 
Circuit would find the language of Rule 15's advisory committee notes persuasive and, like ""most courts[,]"" hold that Rule 
15(c)(1)(C) applies to an amended pleading adding new plaintiffs. Id. "
303,15," Defendants assert that the court should dismiss Castillo as a class representative because it ""first filed its claims four and a 
half years ago, but then inexplicably dropped them even though no other direct purchaser action was pending at the time."" Doc. 
138 at 28. As an Illinois court has noted, ""when a plaintiff belatedly seeks to join the suit, the fundamental question is not why the 
plaintiff failed to act sooner, but rather whether the late addition to the case comes without fair notice to the defendants and "
304,," would cause undue prejudice."" Olech, 138 F. Supp. 2d at 1047. The court declines to question Castillo's motivations for filing 
and dismissing its other lawsuit. Instead, as discussed above, it considers whether adding Castillo to this lawsuit violates the fair 
notice and undue prejudice requirements. It doesn't. "
305,16," Defendants cite two district court cases holding that China Agritech barred class action claims asserted by new plaintiffs. Doc. 
148 at 18. But the facts of those cases don't resemble the ones presented here. Defendants' first-cited case involved a newly-
filed class action brought by members of a putative class who were ""carved out of a related class action, after the putative class 
representative in that case amended their complaint to narrow the definition of the proposed class."" Ochoa v. Pershing LLC, No. 
3:16-CV-1485-N, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 214299, 2021 WL 5163196, at *1 (N.D. Tex. Nov. 5, 2021) (citation omitted). The Texas 
court held that the new lawsuit was ""follow-on class litigation"" to which American Pipe tolling didn't apply. 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
214299, [WL] at *2. Defendants' second case was ""the third successive class action case"" filed by the same counsel against the 
same defendants alleging the same facts. Practice Mgmt. Support Servs. v. Cirque Du Soleil Inc., No. 14 C 2032, 2018 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 129633, 2018 WL 3659349, at *1 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 2, 2018). The Illinois court concluded that American Pipe didn't toll 
the class claims because the case was ""a follow-on class action that was filed well after the four-year statute of limitations 
expired."" 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 129633, [WL] at *3. For reasons already explained, the amendment adding FWK and Castillo as 
plaintiffs to this case's operative Complaint isn't a ""follow-on class action"" that China Agritech prohibits. Defendants' cited cases 
just don't apply. "
307,17," Defendants also assert that the Fifth and Sixth Circuit only have recognized the existence of a co-conspirator exception in the 
limited context of vertical price fixing arrangements. See generally In re Beef Indus. Antitrust Litig., 600 F.2d 1148, 1161-63 (5th 
Cir. 1979) (recognizing that some courts have permitted an exception to Illinois Brick for suits involving vertical price fixing 
conspiracies but holding that the allegations in that case didn't bring the case within that limited exception); see also Jewish 
Hosp. Ass'n of Louisville, Ky., Inc. v. Stewart Mech. Enters., Inc., 628 F.2d 971, 977 (6th Cir. 1980) (holding that plaintiff ""never 
pleaded the existence of a vertical conspiracy nor alleged facts sufficient to sustain such an allegation"" so the court ""need not 
decide whether . . . such conspiracies are outside the rationale of Illinois Brick""). Although these cases don't contain language 
expressly limiting the co-conspirator exception to vertical price fixing arrangements, defendants correctly assert that these Circuit 
Courts of Appeals haven't applied the exception outside that narrow context."
307,18," Also, at least one court in our Circuit has held that Illinois Brick doesn't bar suits involving vertical price fixing arrangements 
with a ""straight cost passthrough"" because Illinois Brick's concerns about ""the complexities of tracing the amount of overcharge 
passed on to an indirect purchaser"" weren't at issue in that case and ""[m]ultiple liability [was] also not a significant concern"" 
based on the claims. In re New Mexico Natural Gas Antitrust Litigation, MDL No. 403, 1982 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9452, 1982 WL 
1827, at *9-10 (D.N.M. Jan. 26, 1982). "
308,19," Plaintiffs also cite an Eighth Circuit case that held—without much reasoning or analysis—that ""indirect purchasers may bring 
an antitrust claim if they allege the direct purchasers are 'party to the antitrust violation' and join the direct purchasers as 
defendants."" Insulate SB, Inc. v. Advanced Finishing Sys., Inc., 797 F.3d 538, 542 (8th Cir. 2015) (quoting Campos v. 
Ticketmaster Corp., 140 F.3d 1166, 1170-71 & nn. 3-4 (8th Cir. 1998)). Pfizer argues that Insulate is inapposite because the 
case it relies on—Campos—permitted an indirect purchaser to pursue claims for injunctive relief. See Campos, 140 F.3d at 
1172. But, Pfizer argues, Illinois Brick's concerns about duplicative recovery aren't present in cases seeking only injunctive relief. 
Doc. 147 at 12 n.3. The court isn't persuaded by Insulate's holding. It's an out-of-Circuit case that applied the co-conspirator 
exception without significant explanation for its decision to do so. And, that application doesn't comport with the Tenth Circuit's 
directive that ""exceptions to Illinois Brick are exceedingly narrow in scope"" and those exceptions ""should be few in number."" 
Zinser, 660 F.2d at 761."
308,20," Nor could the Tenth Circuit adopt such an exception, according to defendants. Defendants assert that the Tenth Circuit 
wouldn't apply the Howard Hess exception because our Circuit never has recognized the ""complete involvement defense."" See 
Semke v. Enid Auto. Dealers Ass'n, 456 F.2d 1361, 1369 (10th Cir. 1972) (""The Supreme Court has many times disapproved of 
the in pari delicto doctrine in antitrust cases and . . . rules it out in cases in which the plaintiff was charged with participating in 
the unlawful scheme.""). Because the court concludes that it can't extend the exceptions to Illinois Brick beyond that authorized 
by the Supreme Court and Tenth Circuit, it need not reach this interesting argument. "
310,21," Pfizer also argues that plaintiff KPH lacks standing to sue Pfizer under its Assignment from McKesson because its original 
Assignment from McKesson only conveyed a right to assert generic delay claims against Mylan Specialty L.P. Because the court 
concludes that Illinois Brick bars plaintiffs' claims against Pfizer because plaintiffs are indirect purchasers of EpiPens, the court 
need not decide whether plaintiff KPH's claims against Pfizer fail because of a lack of standing to sue Pfizer under the original 
Assignment."
310,22," Both Mylan and Pfizer move to dismiss plaintiffs' claims arguing that they fail to state plausible claims for relief. And, Mylan 
has incorporated by reference Pfizer's arguments for dismissal for failing to state a claim. See Doc. 138 at 29 n.12. So, the court 
addresses both Mylan and Pfizer's dismissal arguments in this section, even though the court already has dismissed plaintiffs' 
claims against Pfizer because Illinois Brick bars plaintiffs' indirect purchaser claims. "
327,1," Section 1 of the Sherman Act, which authorizes both civil and criminal prosecutions of antitrust violations, provides in relevant 
part that: Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the 
several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal. Every person who shall [*13]  make any contract or engage 
in any combination or conspiracy hereby declared to be illegal shall be deemed guilty of a felony."
327,15, U.S.C. § 1. 
340,1," The Court assumes familiarity with the factual and procedural background. The underlying complaint allegations are recited in 
the Court's order denying Defendants' motions to dismiss and are incorporated here by reference. (Dkt. No. 281 at 5-6.) "
347,1," As the parties were informed on September 22, 2020, the Eastern District of California is in a state of judicial emergency, 
including while this motion was pending resolution, which caused a significant backlog of pending matters. (See Doc. 2-3.) The 
action was assigned to the undersigned in 2022. (See Doc. 16.) "
352,2," Notably, the Ninth Circuit determined ""a common law violation such as breach of contract is insufficient"" to support a claim 
under the unlawful prong. Shroyer v. New Cingular Wireless Servs., Inc., 622 F.3d 1035, 1044 (9th Cir. 2010). "
355,3," Indeed, Villali did not file a motion to remand, though he now indirectly challenges Defendants' prior assertion that Barner was 
fraudulently joined as a defendant. (See Doc. 1 at 4.) "
367,1," The Court also notes that the defendants' contention here depends upon acceptance of their proposed reading of the 568 
Exemption's use of the term ""need-blind."" If they are wrong about that, they are wrong about this too, as a family's wealth 
certainly falls within ""the financial circumstances of the student involved or the student's family."" 15 U.S.C. § 1 note (emphasis 
added). "
368,2," The plaintiffs also allege that Columbia considers financial need when making admissions decisions for its School of General 
Studies. The only specific fact pleaded with respect to this allegation is a quotation from the undergraduate student newspaper 
stating that ""General Studies admissions are not need-blind."" Am. Compl. ¶ 149. The defendants argue that this is a conclusory 
statement that cannot support the plaintiffs' allegations on a motion to dismiss. This specific point may have some merit, but the 
Court need not adjudicate this definitively, as it has found that the plaintiffs have otherwise plausibly alleged the non-applicability 
of the 568 Exemption. "
376,1," Amazon separately moved to strike the class allegations in the CAC. See ECF No. 79. The Publishers include an argument to 
strike the class allegations in their brief in support of their motion to dismiss. See ECF No. 76 (Publisher's Br.) at 23-25. Plaintiff 
filed a separate opposition to Amazon's motion to strike. See ECF No. 98. I will issue a separate report and recommendation 
addressing Defendants' motions to strike the class allegations."
376,2," The factual allegations recounted herein are taken from the Amended Class Action Complaint and documents integral to it. 
Because the case is before the Court on Defendants' motion to dismiss, I accept the well-pled factual allegations of the 
complaint as true and draw all reasonable inferences in Plaintiff's favor. ATSI Communications, Inc. v. Shaar Fund, Ltd., 493 
F.3d 87, 98 (2d Cir. 2007)."
376,3," ""Trade books"" is a term of art referring to ""general interest fiction and non-fiction books,"" distinguished from ""non-trade books"" 
like academic textbooks or reference materials. CAC ¶ 1. "
377,4," Although [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] distribution agreement [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT], Amazon publicly 
confirmed at the time of the contract's negotiation, that the agreement was the same contract recently signed by the other 
Publishers. CAC ¶ 8. To support its allegations, the CAC includes references to specific provisions in the agreements between 
each of the Publishers and Amazon. See, e.g., CAC ¶¶ 8-9 nn. 19-22. "

388,11," Defendants challenge Plaintiff's antitrust standing only as it relates to the Sherman Act claims. See Publisher's Br. at 10. 
Defendants do not raise any argument concerning Plaintiff's standing to assert a claim for violation of the Robinson-Patman Act 
Claim, Count I of the SAC."
388,12," The ""efficient enforcer"" prong is not challenged by Defendants here. I thus only address whether Plaintiff has adequately 
alleged that it suffered an antitrust injury. "
390,13," Section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 15(a), authorizes private suits for treble damages for violations of Section 2(a) of the 
RPA. See Blue Tree Hotels Inv. (Canada), Ltd. v. Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc., 369 F.3d 212, 218 (2d Cir. 2004)."
390,14," Price discrimination claims under Section 2(a) of the RPA generally fall into three categories: primary-line price discrimination, 
secondary-line price discrimination, and tertiary-line price discrimination. See George Haug, 148 F.3d at 141 n.2. Plaintiff alleges 
a secondary-line price discrimination claim, which can arise ""when a seller's discrimination impacts competition among the 
seller's customers; i.e. the favored purchasers and disfavored purchasers."" Id. (citing F.T.C. v. Sun Oil Co., 371 U.S. 505, 83 S. 
Ct. 358, 9 L. Ed. 2d 466 (1963)). "
392,15," Amazon gave Plaintiff's counsel an opportunity to review redacted versions of those agreements. See ECF No. 43 at 1; ECF 
No. 44 at 1-2 n.2 "
393,16," To the extent cases like Flash Elecs., Inc. v. Universal Music & Video Distrib. Corp., 312 F. Supp. 2d 379 (E.D.N.Y. 2004), and 
George Haug Co. concluded that a Section 2(a) claim was adequately pled based on a bare recitation that the defendant seller 
charged the favored purchaser a lower price, without indication as to the amount of the discount or factual support for the 
existence of the discount, it is not clear that such RPA claims could survive a motion to dismiss post-Twombly. Cf. Flash Elec. 
Inc., 312 F. Supp. 2d at 398-99 (concluding, based on Haug, that plaintiff had pled a Section 2(a) claim where it alleged that 
""Universal sold its product to wholesale distributors at a cheaper price than sold to the plaintiffs,"" even though the ""pleadings 
[were] thin"" and included no details about the amount of the lower price); Haug, 148 F.3d at 144 (concluding that Section 2(a) 
claim had been adequately pled where it did ""not detail the amount and degree of the price discrimination"" and only alleged that 
plaintiff had been ""injured during the 4 years prior to its termination""). "
397,17," Plaintiff cites to the Supreme Court's decision in Hasbrouck to support its argument that, ""as a matter of law,"" the additional 
services performed by Amazon cannot form the basis of a functional discount because [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT]. 
ECF No. 94 (Pl.'s Br.) at 19-20. Hasbrouck, however, does not stand for that categorical assertion. In that case, the Supreme 
Court merely concluded that ""there was no substantial evidence indicating that the discounts"" by Texaco to the buyers 
""constituted a reasonable reimbursement for the value to Texaco"" of the ""actual marketing functions"" performed by the buyers. 
496 U.S. at 562. The Court, however, made clear that a discount need only be ""reasonable"" for the functional-discount exception 
to apply. Id. at 561-62. To be sure, in assessing the reasonableness of the discount, the Court noted that the buyers were 
""separately compensated for its hauling function."" Id. But the Court's discussion makes clear that it considered multiple factors in 
assessing the reasonableness of the discount (including that the buyers did not maintain ""any significant storage facilities""), and 
it was only the ""absence of evidence to connect the discount to any savings enjoyed by Texaco"" that rendered the functional-
discount exception unavailable in that case. Id. at 561-63. "
398,18," The meeting-competition defense is not an element of a prima facie case for violation of Section 2(a) of the RPA. See Alan's of 
Atlanta, Inc. v. Minolta Corp., 903 F.2d 1414, 1420 (11th Cir. 1990) (explaining that meeting-competition defense ""allows a seller 
to rebut a prima facie case of price discrimination""). However, to state a plausible claim of price discrimination under Twombly, a 
plaintiff must allege facts from which to infer that the discriminatory price was unlawful—i.e., not offered in good faith to meet a 
competitor's price—because ""providing different prices to different purchasers is consistent with both unlawful price 
discrimination and lawful pricing justified by different terms or conditions of sale."" Sw. Paper Co., 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 189993, 
2013 WL 11238487, at *5."
398,19," None of the cases Plaintiff cites (ECF No. 94 (Pl.'s Br.) at 23 n.6) support its argument that the meeting-competition defense 
cannot apply here because the Publishers' book titles are not of ""like grade or quality."" See Checker Motors Corp. v. Chrysler 
Corp., 283 F. Supp. 876, 889-90 (S.D.N.Y. 1968) (concluding that defense was not applicable because evidence did not show 
that rebate plan was offered ""in response to a rival's rebate scheme"" as the evidence showed that the rebate plan had been 
introduced several years before competitors introduced their own rebate arrangements); Reeder-Simco GMC, Inc. v. Volvo GM 
Heavy Truck Corp., 374 F.3d 701 (8th Cir. 2004) (court did not address or discuss meeting-competition defense). "
399,20, Amazon does not dispute that it is a buyer engaged in interstate commerce—the second element of a Section 2(f) claim. 
405,1, The parties dispute whether the SAC or TAC remedies this defect.
405,2," The parties debate whether Judge Kapala's and Judge Lee's rulings regarding standing are the law of the case. The law of the 
case doctrine may operate in certain circumstances to inhibit a judge from altering previous rulings made in the same litigation. 
Jarrard v. CDI Telecomms., Inc., 408 F.3d 905, 911-12 (7th Cir. 2005). However, the issues presented by Walters require only 
an analysis of what the previous court did, that is, whether the previous court definitively found that there was no jurisdiction, 
thus prohibiting substitution of named plaintiffs. 163 F.3d at 432. In recounting the decisions of Judge Kapala and Judge Lee, 
this Court makes no finding on whether those decisions constitute the law of the case, nor is this Court opining on whether the 
TAC satisfies the various standing requirements discussed above. Because the Court has declined to engage in such an 
analysis in the context of Defendants' futility argument, there is no need for this Court to opine on whether Judge Kapala's and 
Judge Lee's rulings on standing constitute the law of the case. The parties can raise these issues before the District Judge if and 
when the standing issue is raised as to the TAC. See G & G Closed Cir. Events, LLC v. Castillo, 327 F. Supp. 3d 1119, 1134

Opposition to Purchasers' Motion for Summary Judgment (Docket No. 340) (""Johnson Decl.""). "
429,2," Local Rule 56.1 provides in relevant part that ""[m]otions for summary judgment shall include a concise statement of the material 
facts of record as to which the moving party contends there is no genuine issue to be tried, with page references to affidavits, 
depositions and other documentation ... A party opposing the motion shall include a concise statement of the material facts of 
record as to which it is contended that there exists a genuine issue to be tried, with page references to affidavits, depositions 
and other documentation ... Unless the court orders otherwise, the moving party may file a reply within 14 days after the 
response is served."""
429,3," The plaintiffs responded to paragraphs 8-11 of Sanofi P.R.'s Local Rule 56.1 Statement of Material Undisputed Facts by citing 
to the Declaration of Kristen A. Johnson Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(d). (PR ¶¶ 8-11). Under Rule 56(d), ""[i]f 
a nonmovant shows by affidavit or declaration that, for specified reasons, it cannot present facts essential to justify its 
opposition"" to a motion for summary judgment, ""the court may: (1) defer considering the motion or deny it; (2) allow time to 
obtain affidavits or declarations or to take discovery; or (3) issue any appropriate order."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(d)."
429,4," In the Declaration of Kristen A. Johnson Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(d), Ms. Johnson, an attorney for the plaintiffs, explains 
that the plaintiffs ""are not in a position to assert facts to dispute, or to not dispute, the conclusory statements of fact"" asserted in 
paragraphs 8-11 of Sanofi P.R.'s Local Rule 56.1 Statement of Material Undisputed Facts and in the underlying Declaration of 
the defendants' witness, John D. Conway, because discovery is ongoing and ""may well bear on these issues."" (Docket No. 330 
¶¶ 8-9, 11). This is insufficient to warrant relief under Rule 56(d). As an initial matter, Ms. Johnson's Declaration consists of legal 
arguments by the plaintiffs' counsel. As described above, such arguments are not properly part of a Local Rule 56.1 statement 
and the plaintiffs have failed to file a motion for relief under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(d). Moreover, this court explicitly ordered the 
parties to complete all fact discovery relating to the single economic enterprise issue by December 8, 2021, prior to filing any 
motions for summary judgment by December 22, 2021. (Docket No. 282 at 2). Accordingly, the plaintiffs' opportunity to obtain 
discovery prior to the filing of the instant motions has expired. Finally, where, as here, the party opposing summary judgment "
430,," claims the reason it cannot adduce facts necessary to oppose a motion for summary judgment is incomplete discovery, the party 
must ""(i) 'show good cause for the failure to have discovered the facts sooner'; (ii) 'set forth a plausible basis for believing that 
specific facts ... probably exist'; and (iii) 'indicate how the emergent facts ... will influence the outcome of the pending summary 
judgment motion.'"" In re PHC, Inc. Shareholder Litig., 762 F.3d 138, 143 (1st Cir. 2014) (quoting Resolution Trust Corp. v. N. 
Bridge Assocs., Inc., 22 F.3d 1198, 1203 (1st Cir. 1994)). Here, the plaintiffs have not presented any reasons, much less 
compelling reasons, for their failure to discover the relevant facts sooner. Nor have they indicated how the ongoing discovery 
might change the outcome of Sanofi P.R.'s motion for summary judgment. Consequently, they have not shown that they are 
entitled to relief under Rule 56(d)."

512 F. Supp. 3d 106 (D. Mass. 2020) and In re Lantus Direct Purchaser Antitrust Litig., No. 16-12652-JGD, 2021 U.S. Dist.

431,7," As this court has previously explained in detail, the ""30-month stay of approval"" occurs when the manufacturer of a drug listed 
in the FDA's Orange Book files a timely patent infringement suit against a potential competitor who wishes to obtain FDA 
approval of follow-on or generic versions of the existing drug, before the competitor has an opportunity to enter the market. 
Lantus, 512 F. Supp. 3d at 114-15. The filing of the infringement action automatically prevents the FDA from approving the 
aspiring competitor's application for up to 30 months. Id. at 115. "
432,8," March 18, 2020 was the date when Mylan's follow-on insulin glargine product became eligible for FDA approval. (DR ¶ 31). "
434,9," The plaintiffs contend that ""Sanofi P.R. is now functionally a stripped-back division of Sanofi U.S."" (PF ¶ 62). However, the 
defendants dispute this assertion and have presented evidence showing that Sanofi P.R. remains an operating legal entity that 
conducts business, employs and pays personnel, and files annual tax returns. (DR ¶ 62; Supp. Rodriguez Decl. ¶ 3). They have 
also presented evidence showing that Sanofi P.R. does not report its annual financial results to Sanofi U.S. or consolidate its 
annual financial results with those of Sanofi U.S. (Silvestri Decl. ¶ 6). In addition, it is undisputed that Sanofi P.R. remains a 
Puerto Rico corporation with a principal place of business in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico. (DR ¶ 62). Therefore, and for the reasons 
explained below, the nature of the relationship between Sanofi U.S. and Sanofi P.R. should be determined by a factfinder at trial. "
436,10," As described above in the Introduction to this Report and Recommendation, the plaintiffs have defined the class period as 
February 13, 2015 through December 31, 2016 ""or until the anticompetitive effects of Sanofi's conduct cease[.]"" (TAC ¶ 487). "
437,11," The facts relating to Sanofi P.R.'s contract negotiations are based in part on Mr. Freeman's deposition testimony. (See PF ¶ 
59; DF ¶ 59; PRF ¶ 59). The plaintiffs argue that this court should disregard the corrections Mr. Freeman made to his testimony 
in an errata sheet dated December 28, 2021. (PRF ¶ 59; see also Def. Supp. Ex. 1). However, the plaintiffs have not moved to 
strike the errata sheet or otherwise attempted to explain with any clarity the basis for their argument. (PRF ¶ 59). To the extent 
they contend that the errata sheet altered the substance of Mr. Freeman's testimony, they have not shown why this was 
improper under the circumstances. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(e) (""On request by the deponent or a party before the deposition is 
completed, the deponent must be allowed 30 days after being notified by the officer that the [deposition] transcript or recording is 
available in which: (A) to review the transcript or recording; and (B) if there are changes in form or substance, to sign a 
statement listing the changes and the reasons for making them."" (emphasis added)). "
438,12," ""Def. Opp. Mem."" refers to the Defendants' Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs' Motion for Partial

439,13," The court is providing this background for the edification of any reviewing court, and it is only a brief summary of an 
extensively argued motion."
439,14," While the plaintiffs mentioned Illinois Brick in their memorandum in support of their motion to file a TAC, they did not suggest 
that the ""owned or controlled"" exception is applicable to this case. (See Docket No. 177 at 9). Instead, they cited it as an 
example of a situation in which a monopolist is not allowed to escape liability by selling a product through a subsidiary. (Id.). "
444,15," ""Pl. Reply Mem."" refers to the Reply in Support of Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment as to 
Standing to Pursue Puerto Rico Overcharges From Sanofi-Aventis U.S., LLC (Docket No. 338). "
445,16," The defendants argue that some of the factors on which the plaintiffs rely to establish control are irrelevant to this case 
because they are based on non-Illinois Brick cases in which courts have applied different tests such as the test for determining 
whether a court may exercise personal jurisdiction under the Clayton Act over a parent corporation based on the parent's control 
of its subsidiary in the forum state, and the test for determining whether a company is the alter ego of another. (Def. Opp. Mem. 
at 10-11). However, the defendants have not cited any cases that limit a court's consideration to a specific list of factors, and at 
least one court in this circuit has indicated a willingness to consider any factors that may prove relevant in a specific case. See 
Cutler, 611 F. Supp. at 750 (finding that ""principles set forth in the above-cited cases[,]"" including a case in which the court 
concluded that a subsidiary was the ""alter ego of the parent"" company, were relevant to the question whether newspaper 
carriers were under the control of a publisher for purposes of the owned or controlled exception to Illinois Brick, and noting that 
""[o]ther factors may prove relevant as the record is developed.""). In any event, this issue does not need to be finally decided at 
this stage because even if this court assumes that all the factors listed by the plaintiffs are relevant to the issue of control, the 
plaintiffs have not shown that they are entitled to summary judgment. "
446,17," The plaintiffs note but do not appear to rely on an argument that the defendants waived the defense of state-action immunity 
by failing to raise the issue as an affirmative defense in their answer to the complaint. (Pl. Reply Mem. at 6). ""First Circuit 
decisions consistently hold that failure to plead an affirmative defense generally results in waiver of the defense and its exclusion 
from the case. Keefe v. Locals 805, Int'l Longshoremen's Ass'n, AFL-CIO, Local 800, No. 04-11340-DPW, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
62657, 2007 WL 2461045, *6 (D. Mass. Aug. 23, 2007), and cases cited. In light of the plaintiffs' apparent decision not to rely on 
waiver, this court finds it unnecessary to address that issue. "

Judgment (Docket No. 312). "
449,19," ""Pl. Opp. Mem."" refers to the Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs' Opposition to Sanofi-Aventis Puerto Rico, Inc.'s Motion for Summary 
Judgment (Docket No. 325). "
450,20," It appears that no other circuit court has directly addressed the question whether Copperweld's reasoning should apply to 
claims for monopolization or attempted monopolization under § 2 of the Sherman Act. See Chandler v. Phoenix Servs., No. 
7:19-cv-00014-O, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 63779, 2020 WL 1848047, at *13 (N.D. Tex. Apr. 13, 2020), appeal filed, No. 21-10626 
(5th Cir. June 18, 2021). While the First Circuit has indicated in passing that ""a company or any other single economic unit can 
violate section 2 of the Sherman Act,"" it has not had an opportunity to rule on that issue or consider the circumstances under "
451,," which the single economic enterprise theory might apply in such a case. Gonzalez-Maldonado, 693 F.3d at 250 (explaining that 
appellants abandoned their section 2 antitrust claim by failing to brief it on appeal)."
451,21," After observing that ""[t]he question of what must be shown in order to hold a particular affiliated corporation liable as part of an 
inter-corporate scheme appears to be uncharted territory at the federal circuit level[,]"" the Lenox court determined that it was 
unnecessary to express an opinion on the appropriate test or the evidence needed to satisfy any such test because the plaintiff's 
antitrust claims failed on other grounds. Lenox, 847 F.3d at 1239. Thus, the Tenth Circuit left the resolution of those issues ""for 
another day."" Id. "
454,22," The plaintiffs argue that ""[t]here is no evidence that [the] pro forma 3% reduction to the Sanofi U.S. price increases by DACO 
operated to lower the price of Lantus in Puerto Rico below supracompetitive levels."" (Pl. Opp. Mem. at 14 (footnote omitted)). 
However, there is no specific evidence supporting the plaintiffs' characterization of DACO's 3% price reductions as merely ""pro 
forma."" More importantly, the plaintiffs' argument does not alter the fact that DACO, rather than the defendants, had final 
responsibility for setting the price of Lantus products sold in Puerto Rico. (See Supp. Rodriguez Decl. ¶¶ 6-7). Nor does it alter 
the fact that Sanofi P.R.'s role in the alleged anticompetitive scheme is distinguishable from the crucial role played by CES in 
Arandell. "
455,23," The plaintiffs argue that evidence regarding the percentages of total sales attributable to Sanofi P.R. is immaterial because the 
overcharges paid by Puerto Rican purchasers could not have occurred without Sanofi P.R.'s participation. (Pl. Opp. Mem. at 15). 
As described above, the significance of this evidence is that it demonstrates that Sanofi P.R.'s sales were not ""critical"" or 
""crucial"" to Sanofi U.S.'s ability to maintain the alleged anticompetitive scheme. Under Arandell, Sanofi P.R.'s minor contribution 
to the antitrust scheme undermines the plaintiffs' claims that it engaged in coordinated activity with Sanofi U.S. See Arandell, 
900 F.3d at 634-35 (finding that evidence sufficed to create a triable issue of liability against CES where plaintiffs presented 
evidence that ""CES's role was essential to securing the benefit of the [affiliated companies'] price-fixing"" and ""crucial"" to the 
ability to carry out the price-fixing conspiracy)."
455,24," In light of this court's conclusion that the plaintiffs have presented insufficient evidence to show that Sanofi P.R. directly 
engaged in conduct that violates § 2 of the Sherman Act or that it could be held liable under § 2 as part of a single economic 
enterprise with Sanofi U.S., it is not necessary at this stage to address Sanofi P.R.'s argument that it is entitled to summary 
judgment on the plaintiffs' claim for attempted monopolization because ""no reasonable juror could conclude that it possessed the 
specific intent to monopolize."" (Def. Mem. at 17)."
455,25," The parties are hereby advised that under the provisions of Fed. R. Civ. P. 72, any party who objects to these proposed 
findings and recommendations must file a written objection thereto with the Clerk of this Court within 14 days after being served

458,1," Allegheny sets the burden-shifting framework that applies to proofs of claim in the Third Circuit. In re F-Squared Inv. Mgmt., 
LLC, 546 B.R. 538, 543 (Bankr. D. Del. 2016). ""[A] claim that alleges facts sufficient to support a legal liability to the claimant 
satisfies the claimant's initial obligation to go forward. The burden of going forward then shifts to the objector to produce 
evidence sufficient to negate the prima facie validity of the filed claim."" Id. "
459,2," Lenox noted that ""neither this circuit nor any other has provided a clear answer to the question of what level of involvement is 
sufficient to meet the burden"" of coming forward with evidence that each defendant independently participated in the enterprise's 
scheme. Id. at 1237. It was unnecessary to answer the question, as Lenox's claims were ultimately barred by claim preclusion. 
Id. at 1238. "
464,1," Except where otherwise noted, this opinion generally refers to the defendants collectively as ComEd. "
489,1," Reckitt is currently known as Indivior, Inc. In December 2014, Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals, Inc. was demerged from its 
prior parent, the Reckitt Benckiser Group PLC, into Indivior PLC. Although Indivior is technically the named defendant in this 
case, the pleadings and many of the relevant exhibits use the name ""Reckitt."" To avoid confusion, I will refer to Indivior as 
""Reckitt."""

extent a statement is undisputed by the parties, I will cite only to the parties' submissions. If a statement is disputed and the 
dispute can be easily resolved by reference to the exhibits, I will cite the supporting exhibits. If a statement is disputed, but the

unsupported by reference to a specific exhibit. "
491,3," MonoSol is now known as Aquestive Therapeutics, Inc. and is a named Defendant in the States' action. As the relevant 
evidence uses the name ""MonoSol,"" I will, for purposes of this Memorandum Opinion, refer to Aquestive as ""MonoSol."" "
500,4," Typically, a threshold step in assessing antitrust harm requires a definition of the relevant market, which refers to the area of 
effective competition. Am. Express, 138 S. Ct. at 2285. If a plaintiff can make a showing of actual anticompetitive effects, 
however, then ""[a] full-blown market analysis is not necessary."" Bhan v. NME Hosps., Inc., 929 F.2d 1404, 1413 (9th Cir. 1991). Here, Plaintiffs allege actual effects on competition. Moreover, for purposes of the present analysis only, the parties avoid 
definition of the relevant market and assume that it consists of only Suboxone products and their generic equivalents. "
508,5," As noted above, generic drugs that are bioequivalent to, and of the same dosage size, form (i.e., tablet, capsule, film), and 
administration as a brand drug are designated as ""AB"" rated to the brand drug. (Def.'s Ex. 1, ¶ 54.) In all fifty states, pharmacists 
are permitted to, and in most states are required to, substitute generic drugs that are AB-rated to brand drugs without consulting 
the prescribing physician. (Def.'s Ex. 26, ¶¶ 24-26.)"
508,6," In order for therapeutic substitution to occur, the patient must be asked if they want the lower-cost generic, the pharmacist has 
to check insurance coverage, the pharmacist has to discuss costs and benefits with the patient, the physician must be contacted "
509,," about the substitution and will often not be reached immediately, the pharmacist must document the revised prescription, and 
the new prescription must be transmitted to the store. (Def.'s Ex. 26, Rep. of Robert Verscharen ¶¶ 50-52.) "
510,7," Reckitt relies on In re Processed Egg Products, 962 F.3d 719, 728 (3d Cir. 2020) to argue that the Third Circuit requires a 
court's individual assessment of the legality of the various components of an alleged conspiracy. This characterization is 
incorrect. In reality, the Third Circuit held that, ""[c]ourts can consider the differing components of an alleged conspiracy 
separately when determining which mode of antitrust analysis to apply,"" i.e., rule of reason or per se standard. Id. at 728 
(emphasis added). The Court rejected the plaintiffs' argument that because they alleged a single overarching scheme and 
because some of the components of that scheme called for application of the per se standard, then the per se standard must 
apply to the entirety of the scheme. Rather, ""[w]hen different stratagems are alleged to have furthered an antitrust conspiracy, 
the court is free to determine which analytical standard should apply to each."" Id. at 728. Were it otherwise, ""[a] plaintiff with a 
bucket full of allegations about behavior rightly subject to the rule of reason could easily, by adding a single allegation of 
behavior that its anticompetitive per se, demand per se analysis of the whole."" Id. Simply stated, In re Processed Eggs requires courts to disaggregate an anticompetitive scheme only for purposes of determining 
which analytical standard to apply, not to determine the legality of each component. Here, neither party argues for application of 
the per se rule to any part of the alleged anticompetitive conduct at issue. Rather, both sides appear to agree that the rule of 
reason applies to the entirety of the antitrust scheme. Given that agreement, In re Processed Eggs has no applicability here."
510,8," Defendant contends that in LePage's, the Third Circuit, before considering the ""overall combined effect"" of the defendant's 
anticompetitive conduct, first determined that all of the conduct at issue was in fact exclusionary. Defendant's argument is 
inaccurate. In LePage's, the Third Circuit did not disaggregate the alleged anticompetitive conduct. Rather it recognized that 
""[t]he relevant inquiry is the anticompetitive effect of 3M's exclusionary practices considered together."" Id. at 162. It reiterated the 
Supreme Court's mandate, in Cont'l Ore, that courts ""must look to the monopolist's conduct taken as a whole rather than 
considering each aspect in isolation."" Id. Citing with approval the Ninth Circuit decision in City of Anaheim v. S. Cal. Edison Co., "
511,955," F.2d 1373, 1376 (9th Cir. 1992), the Third Circuit expressly noted that ""it would not be proper to focus on specific individual 
acts of an accused monopolist while refusing to consider their overall combined effect . . . We are dealing with what has been 
called the 'synergistic effect' of the mixture of the elements."" Id. (quoting Anaheim, 955 F.2d at 1376)."
511,9," Reckitt attempts to recharacterize the holding in Bonjorno. It argues that Bonjorno only held that there was no need for a 
damages jury to determine what effect was caused by each unlawful act by the defendant only because a prior liability jury had 
already ""found causation from only those acts which could evince the defendants' willful acquisition or maintenance of a 
monopoly."" Bonjorno v. Kaiser Aluminum & Chem. Corp., 752 F.2d 802, 813 (3d Cir. 1984). Reckitt's interpretation of that case is inaccurate. In Bonjorno the plaintiffs' theory of its antitrust case was ""not that any one act in 
itself is unlawful, but that all the acts taken together show the willful acquisition or maintenance of a monopoly which damaged 
and forced [another company] out of business."" Id. at 813. The Third Circuit noted that ""[w]hen the antitrust injury is of an 
indivisible nature, and the jury properly found that the injury was caused by the defendant's monopolization or attempt to 
monopolize, and when the plaintiffs' proof of damages does not require distinguishing the various acts by the defendants, then it 
is unnecessary to segregate the damages according to the specific causes."" Id. "
512,10," These concepts are consistent with the authority submitted by Reckitt in its recent Notice of Supplemental Authority. See 44 
F.4th 959, 2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 20998, 2022 WL 3273055, at *16 (10th Cir. July 29, 2022) (""For the sake of accuracy, 
precision, and analytical clarity, we must evaluate Mylan's alleged exclusionary conduct separately . . . . Only then can we 
evaluate the evidence in totality to see if any 'synergistic effect' saves Sanofi's case."" (internal citations omitted)); 42 F.4th 709, 
2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 21165, 2022 WL 3030833, at *5 (7th Cir. Aug. 1, 2022) (""Neither individually nor collectively do these 
[separate patent] settlements state a claim under § 1 of the Sherman Act.""). "
515,11," In an effort to avoid West Penn's holdings, Defendant argues that ""Santana remains binding authority"" because ""[t]o the extent 
that the decision of a later panel conflicts with existing circuit precedent, [the Court is] bound by the earlier, not the later 
decision."" (Def.'s Mem. Supp. Summ. J. on All Claims 42.) I disagree. West Penn does not conflict with Santana. Rather, it "
516,," clarifies that the statement in Santana was phrased too broadly and that deceptive statements can, in fact, rise to the level of 
anticompetitive conduct in certain circumstances. Accordingly, I am bound by the most recent clarification by the Third Circuit."
516,12," Defendant seizes on the ""blatant misrepresentation"" phrase and characterizes it as a hard and fast standard for reliance on 
deceptive statements in an antitrust case. No fair reading of these cases suggests that the Third Circuit was opining that only 
""blatant misrepresentations"" could be anticompetitive."
516,13," Defendant urges me to adopt the approach used in several circuits, which involves a rebuttable presumption that false 
advertising has only a de minimis effect on competition. These circuits have relied upon a variable six-part test that a plaintiff 
must satisfy to support an antitrust claim premised on false advertising: the statements at issue must be (1) clearly false; (2) 
clearly material; (3) clearly likely to induce unreasonable reliance; (4) made to unsophisticated parties; (5) continued for long 
periods; and (6) not readily cured by rivals. Retractable Techs., Inc. v. Becton Dickinson Co., 842 F.3d 883, 896 (5th Cir. 2016) 
(citing cases). Defendant has not cited, and I have not found, any Third Circuit case that has adopted this approach. Accordingly, I remain 
bound by the dictates set forth in Santana, as modified by West Penn and Doryx. "
517,14," For example, a November 2010 letter to physicians remarked that ""[s]pecific demands or requests for sublingual tablets (mono 
or combo) in lieu of film may indicate risk for patient misuse due to crushing and snorting, and should be investigated by the 
prescribing MD."" (Pls.' Ex. 206; see also PASF ¶ ¶ 81-88.) In addition, based on Reckitt's claims of safety risks with the tablet, 
Reckitt sales representatives told doctors that prescribing tablets could cause the government to reclassify Suboxone and 
eliminate Office-based Opioid Therapy. As such, representatives encouraged doctors to deny tablets to patients in order to 
safeguard such Office-based Opioid Therapy. (PASF ¶ 90.) "
523,15," The parties offer little briefing on whether Reckitt's actions actually constitute a governmental petition which is immunized by 
Noerr-Pennington. I decline to resolve that issue since whether such conduct is immunized has no bearing on the resolution of 
the summary judgment motion before me. "
524,16," In its Eighth Annual Report on Delays in Approvals of Applications Related to Citizen Petitions and Petitions for Stay of 
Agency Action, the FDA explicitly noted that it ""continued to be concerned that section 505(q) may not be discouraging the 
submission of petitions that are intended primarily to delay the approval of competing drug products and do not raise valid 
scientific issues."" https://www.fda.gov/media/99871/download . "
529,17," Much of the evidence regarding MonoSol's alleged participation in the conspiracy is discussed in more detail in the briefing 
regarding MonoSol's separate Motion for Summary Judgment against the Plaintiff States. To the extent MonoSol alleges that 
there is no evidence to establish an improper conspiracy, I reserve discussion of that argument for MonoSol's Motion for 
Summary Judgment. For purposes of the current Motion, I focus solely on whether, as a matter of law, Reckitt and MonoSol 
could conspire."
529,18," In my class certification opinion, I declined to certify a Rule 23(b)(2) class for injunctive relief. Accordingly, the only remaining 
request for injunctive relief is from the Plaintiff States and the individual End Payor Plaintiffs. "
530,19," In an effort to establish that consideration of these issues is appropriate now, Reckitt cites to one sentence in my class 
certification opinion. Specifically, after rejecting five different challenges to Dr. Lamb's expert report, I stated that ""[t]he alleged 
deficiencies in Dr. Lamb's report go not to its admissibility, but rather to its weight. Although Reckitt is free to raise such alleged 
problems during summary judgment briefing or at trial, they do not require exclusion of the report under Daubert."" Suboxone, 
421 F. Supp. 3d 12, 44-45. This sentence, however, did not give Reckitt free reign to either (a) raise new Daubert challenges 
outside of the Court-established Daubert-briefing schedule or (b) re-raise arguments during summary judgment that I have 
already explicitly found to go to the weight rather than the admissibility of the evidence, i.e., arguments that are not appropriate 
for Rule 56 review. "
532,20," The EPPs correctly note that even if I were to address and grant Reckitt's motion on this issue, that decision would have no 
impact on the EPP Class's ability to pursue its claims. ""Once a class has been certified, mooting of the class representative's 
claims does not moot the entire action because the class acquires a legal status separate from the interest asserted by its 
named plaintiff."" Brown v. Phila. Hous. Auth., 350 F.3d 338, 343 (3d Cir. 2003) (quotation omitted). ""Litigation may continue 
because the stake of other class members is attributed to the class representative."" Id.; see also Matz v. Household Int'l Tax 
Reduction Inv. Plan, 774 F.3d 1141, 1145 (7th Cir. 2014) (""Ordinarily when a class representative is dismissed on grounds 
applicable to him but not to all other members of the class, the suit is not dismissed but rather another member of the class is 
substituted as a class representative.""). "

538,54," Section 1 only outlaws ""unreasonable"" restraints. Ohio v. Am. Express Co., 138 S. Ct. 2274, 2283, 201 L. Ed. 2d 678 (2018). 
The Supreme Court explained: Restraints can be unreasonable in one of two ways. A small group of restraints are unreasonable per se because they 
always or almost always tend to restrict competition and decrease output. Typically only ""horizonal"" restraints - restraints 
imposed by agreement between competitors - qualify as unreasonable per se. Restraints that are not unreasonable per se 
are judged under the ""rule of reason."" The rule of reason requires courts to conduct a fact-specific assessment of ""market 
power and market structure ... to assess the restraint's actual effect"" on competition. Id. at 2283-84 (quoting Copperweld Corp. v. Indep. Tube Corp., 467 U.S. 752, 768, 104 S. Ct. 2731, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628 (1984)) 
(other quotation, alteration, and internal citations omitted). To determine whether a restraint violates the rule of reason, ""the 
plaintiff has the initial burden to prove that the challenged restraint has a substantial anticompetitive effect that harms consumers 
in the relevant market."" Id. at 2284. Here, while the Association alleges that price-fixing schemes are per se violations of § 1, R. Doc. 42 at 16, it cannot avoid the 
market analysis required by the rule of reason. First, the only agreement the Association places at issue is one between CTN 
and NOAC, who are not competitors. Thus, because no horizontal restraint is alleged, the agreement cannot qualify as 
unreasonable per se, as the Supreme Court noted in Ohio. Second, ""'[t]he per se rule is appropriate only after courts have had 
considerable experience with the type of restraint at issue and only if courts can predict with confidence that it would be 
invalidated in all or almost all instances under the rule of reason.'"" Marucci Sports, L.L.C. v. Nat'l Collegiate Athletic Ass'n, 751 
F.3d 368, 374 (5th Cir. 2014) (quoting Leegin Creative Leather Prods., Inc. v. PSKS, Inc., 551 U.S. 877, 886-87, 127 S. Ct. 
2705, 168 L. Ed. 2d 623 (2007)) (alteration omitted). ""Moreover, the per se rule should only be applied when 'conduct is so 
pernicious and devoid of redeeming virtue that it is condemned without inquiry into the effect on the market in the particular case "
539,," at hand.'"" Id. (quoting Spectators' Commc'n Network Inc. v. Colonial Country Club, 253 F.3d 215, 223 (5th Cir. 2001)) (alteration 
omitted). Based on what has been presented to the Court, it cannot now apply the per se rule. Accordingly, the Court looks to 
the rule of reason, which requires a definition of the relevant market. See Apani Sw., Inc. v. Coca-Cola Enters., Inc., 300 F.3d 
620, 627 (5th Cir. 2002). Regardless, the Association does not argue that an analysis of the relevant market should not be 
conducted."
539,55," Moreover, due to the blatant inconsistency in pleading regarding the product and geographic markets, the Association does 
not allege with reasonable definiteness facts from which this Court may infer conduct plausible to support a claim for an antitrust 
violation."

of the Federal Trade Commission Act as from time to time amended by the Federal Trade Commission and the courts of the 
United States."" 9 V.S.A. § 2453(b) (footnote omitted). "
558,2," Defendant reiterates its argument that all VCPA claims can only be brought by a ""consumer[.]"" (Doc. 33 at 9.) The Vermont 
Supreme Court has not so held, and the language of the relevant statutory provisions does not support this approach. Compare 
9 V.S.A. § 2461(b) (permitting a claim by ""[a]ny consumer"" alleging a violation of § 2453) with 9 V.S.A. § 2461c(e) (permitting a 
claim by ""[a] person aggrieved"" by a violation of that section). Moreover, HN14[
] the Vermont Attorney General is authorized to enforce the VCPA thereby underscoring that not all claims must be brought by a consumer. See 9 V.S.A. §§ 2461c(d), 
2461c(e). "
559,3," Plaintiff argues in its opposition that Defendant's listing services must be below cost because they are free. See (Doc. 32 at 
22.) This same allegation is not contained in the FAC, and a party cannot amend its complaint through its brief. See Palm Beach 
Mar. Museum, Inc. v. Hapoalim Sec. USA, Inc., 810 F. App'x 17, 20 (2d Cir. 2020). The court will nonetheless draw a reasonable 
inference in Plaintiff's favor that a ""free"" advertisement is below any actual cost associated with it, whatever that cost may be. In 
doing so, it is mindful that HN17[
] ""[l]ow prices benefit consumers regardless of how those prices are set, and so long as they 
are above predatory levels, they do not threaten competition[.]"" Brooke Grp. Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 509 
U.S. 209, 223, 113 S. Ct. 2578, 125 L. Ed. 2d 168 (1993) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). For this reason,

hardship cannot tip the balance against judicial review under those circumstances."" Club Madonna, Inc., 924 F.3d at 1380. "
573,3," In passing, Defendant cites other sources of state statutory authority relating to the City of Vero Beach's corporate charter [ECF 
No. 19 p. 10 (citing 1941 Fla. Laws Chapter 21612, section 41; 1943 Fla. Laws 1113; 1951 Fla. Laws 2803)]. Defendant does 
not explain, however, how the anticompetitive conduct alleged here was a foreseeable result of those provisions. And in any 
event, those provisions still face Chapter 180's limitation on the exercise of extraterritorial municipal corporate power. See Fla. 
Stat. § 180.02. "
574,4," See Herring v. Sec'y, Dep't of Corr., 397 F.3d 1338, 1342 (11th Cir. 2005). "
585,1," Plaintiffs include multiple Hytera legal entities, as well as PowerTrunk. To make the opinion easier to read, the Court will refer 
to Plaintiffs collectively as ""Hytera."" "
592,2," According to Motorola, Hytera's other allegations about ""de facto"" exclusive dealing agreements couldn't apply to the public 
safety market because the ""de facto"" exclusive dealing agreements allege that Motorola's bad behavior impacted the dealers, 
and the public safety market doesn't work through dealers. See Def.'s Mem., at 6-7 (Dckt. No. 89) (citing Am. Cplt., at ¶¶ 15, 180 
(Dckt. No. 45)). Instead, these products are ""sometimes not bid through dealers, but directly from manufacturers so as to ensure 
an appropriate, customized solution is available."" See Am. Cplt., at ¶ 180. "
594,3," As Defendant points out, it's questionable whether these allegations could amount to a ""serial sham,"" anyway. See Def.'s 
Reply, at 1 (Dckt. No. 98). There are only two petitions alleged — hardly a pattern. Other courts have held that ""two proceedings 
. . . does not constitute a pattern"" sufficient to allege a ""serial"" sham claim. Id. (citing In re Wellbutrin XL Antitrust Litig. Indirect 
Purchaser Class, 868 F.3d 132, 157 (3d Cir. 2017)). "

substantial segment of its audience; (3) the deception is material, in that it is likely to influence the purchasing decision; (4) the 
defendant caused its false statement to enter interstate commerce; and (5) the plaintiff has been or is likely to be injured as a 
result of the false statement, either by direct diversion of sales from itself to defendant or by a loss of goodwill associated with its 
products."" See Hot Wax, Inc. v. Turtle Wax, Inc., 191 F.3d 813, 819 (7th Cir. 1999) (citing B. Sanfield, Inc. v. Finlay Fine Jewelry

606,1," For ease of reference, I refer to actions taken by either The Bank of Nova Scotia or Oriental Bank as being taken by the ""Bank."" "
607,2," The following background facts are rendered in the light most favorable to Claxton. See Flora v. Cnty. of Luzerne, 776 F.3d 
169, 175 (3d Cir. 2015) (""When deciding a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), a district court must 
accept all facts alleged in the complaint as true and construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party."")"
607,3," Although the mortgage agreement was first submitted by the Bank with its motion to dismiss and was not attached to the 
Complaint, it is properly before me in this procedural posture, as discussed, infra, at Section III.B. In dismissing the Complaint, I 
treat the parties' mortgage agreement — which is public, undisputedly authentic, and central to this dispute — as part of the 
record."
607,4," The Bank appended materials to its motion to dismiss evidencing that, contrary to the Complaint, Claxton was paid 
approximately $30,000. D.I. 41, Ex. G. We, however, accept as true the facts as alleged in the Complaint. See infra Section III.B. "
608,5," The Bank includes with its motion to dismiss numerous documents that all relate, in some degree, to the mortgage agreement. 
Those include a notice to Claxton of the Bank's renewal of insurance coverage dated January 30, 2018 (Exhibit B); a similar 
notice from May 9, 2014 (Exhibit C); documentation showing that, in 2014, Claxton purchased insurance, so the Bank canceled 
the force-placed insurance (Exhibit D); notices of renewed insurance coverage from August 2015 and July and September 2016 
(Exhibits E and F); insurance disbursement checks for just under $30,000 (Exhibit G); a signed settlement agreement between 
Claxton and the Bank (Exhibit H); and a home inspection report from June 2018 (Exhibit I). "
612,6," Claxton filed her initial complaint on September 19, 2019 (D.I. 1-1), which was removed to federal court on November 27, 2019 
(D.I. 1). The Bank moved to dismiss on December 10, 2019 (D.I. 4), to which Claxton responded by both opposing and moving 
to amend her complaint on January 7, 2020 (D.I. 11). The parties stipulated shortly thereafter to the entry of the first amended 
complaint (D.I. 11-1), which the Bank then moved to dismiss (D.I. 15). Claxton, however, did not actually file that complaint until 
July 16, 2020, six months later (D.I. 22), leading the District Court to sanction Claxton for her delay. (D.I. 26.) It also denied as 
moot the Bank's motion to dismiss. (D.I. 23.) That cycle repeated once more, with another full round of briefing on the Bank's 
motion to dismiss the first amended complaint, followed by the Court granting Claxton's second motion to amend (D.I. 35). That 
led to the now-operative second amended Complaint, filed on March 22, 2021. (D.I. 36.) Briefing on the Bank's motion to dismiss 
completed on May 20, 2021 (D.I. 44), and argument was held on May 11, 2022 (D.I. 52). "

639,3," For purposes of the pending motion, the Court finds these facts by a preponderance of the evidence. "
640,4," Article VII, Section 3, which is titled ""Focused Review or Investigation,"" provides in relevant part: If it is determined there are significant clinical or professional conduct concerns, a focused review or investigation may be 
initiated. Written notice will be provided to the Member regarding the scope of evaluation when a focused review is initiated. 
The Member will receive feedback of the focused review findings. A summary of the events, findings and conclusions will 
be placed in the Member's Quality file. The conclusion may be a recommendation for: a) No further action; or b) Referral 
with recommendation to the MEC for review and possible action. ECF 38-2, at 30. "
642,5," As previously noted, when Dr. Owens refers to PSVMC's ""Bylaws,"" he means PSVMC's Professional Staff Policies and 
Procedures. See n.2, supra. "
643,6," These regulations are based on statutory provisions in the HCQIA. Information required to be reported under 42 U.S.C. § 
11133 must be reported as the Secretary prescribes. Id. § 11134. Similarly, whenever a hospital ""takes a professional review 
action that adversely affects the clinical privileges of a physician for a period longer than 30 days"" or ""accepts the surrender of 
clinical privileges of a physician—(i) while the physician is under an investigation by the entity relating to possible incompetence 
or improper professional conduct, or (ii) in return for not conducting such an investigation or proceeding,"" the hospital must 
report the name of the physician involved, a description of the acts or omissions or other reasons for the action or, if known, for 
the surrender, and such other information respecting the circumstances of the action or surrender as the Secretary deems 
appropriate. Id. § 11133. Although the HCQIA defines ""professional review action,"" it does not define ""investigation."" Id. § 11151."
643,7," Dr. Owens refers to the Guidebook as the ""NPDB Handbook."" See Decl. of H. Laforest (ECF 17) ¶ 4. They are the same thing. "
644,8," Several cases also have looked to the Guidebook for guidance on interpreting the term ""investigations"" in this context. See Doe

999 F. Supp. 106, 112-15 (D.D.C. 1998). "
648,9," During oral argument, counsel for Dr. Owens stated that Dr. Owens had to surrender his hospital privileges to comply with the 
noncompetition provision contained in the Separation Agreement between Dr. Owens and TOC. Counsel for PSVMC responded 
that Dr. Owens could have complied with those obligations merely by switching to inactive status but then would have had to

2019), R. & R. adopted as modified, 400 F. Supp. 3d 418 (E.D. Va. 2019). "
665,4," Facts that Plaintiffs do not dispute are taken as true for the purposes of these motions. Undisputed facts appear in both Merck's 
and Glenmark's memoranda supporting their respective motions for summary judgment. In the interest of space, parallel 
citations to both statements of facts are not always provided. For disputed facts, citations also include ""the parts of the record 
relied on to support the facts alleged to be in dispute."" Local Civil Rule 56(B)."
665,5," Par Pharmaceuticals was expected to, and eventually did, partner with Glenmark to sell its generic ezetimibe. Par was 
involved, through Glenmark, in the settlement negotiations with Merck. Par settled with Plaintiffs early in this litigation. Order 
Approving Settlement (ECF No. 898). "
667,6," Defendants do not dispute these records, only that ""various post-settlement interpretations of the settlement agreement as well 
as actions by Merck with products other than ezetimibe"" do not ""refer to or discuss whether there was any sort of exchange 
during the settlement negotiations."" Glenmark Reply (ECF No. 1195, at 13). "
668,7," At oral argument on summary judgment, Glenmark vigorously contested the sufficiency of Marchetti's testimony on MSN's 
manufacturing capacity, complaining that it was speculative in light of her limited awareness of MSN's operations. Summ. J. 
Hearing Tr. (Hearing Tr.) at 53-57 (ECF No. 1693). Neither Defendant moved to exclude her opinion on this (or any other) basis, 
and I find the evidence she relied on, which included written evidence of MSN's capacity to produce 50 kg batches of ezetimibe 
in November 2013 and email correspondence regarding the company's ability to meet the demand adequate factual support for 
her testimony. This is particularly true in light of the absence of any testimony or evidence contradicting it. Hearing Tr. at 58 
(ECF No. 1693)."
668,8," Vytorin is a combination drug comprised of ezetimibe (branded Zetia) and a statin, namely simvastatin. Merck Mem. ¶ 8 (ECF

668,9," Defendants may object to my opinions and seek review by the District Judge. Fed. R. Civ. P. 72. The U.S. District Judge will 
then review those portions objected to for clear error. Id. To the extent the District Judge rejects or modifies my rulings on the 
admissibility of these expert opinions, the underpinnings of this recommendation on summary judgment may be impacted. "
670,10," Defendants have not sought to exclude Marchetti in a dedicated motion in limine, but Glenmark argues in this motion that 
Marchetti's opinion is unfounded. Glenmark Mem. (ECF No. 1050, at 47-49). I thus address the reliability of Marchetti's opinion 
in the Analysis below."
670,11," An API manufacturer must provide the FDA with information about its facilities, processes, and chemistry, which is contained 
in a DMF. J. Clark Rpt. ¶¶ 27-28 (ECF No. 1148-2, at 10-11). The DMF is approved as part of the ANDA. Id. ¶ 27. "
671,12," This Report and Recommendation relies upon the parties' sealed memoranda, expert reports, and exhibits. To the extent that 
the court utilizes facts in disposing of this motion that were originally sealed, the court has determined that the interests of the 
public outweigh the parties' interests in confidentiality, and the information relied upon is hereby unsealed."
671,13," Section 1 prohibits conspiring to restrain trade, while Section 2 prohibits conspiring to acquire a monopoly. See Advanced 
Health-Care Servs. v. Radford Cmty. Hosp., 910 F.2d 139, 144, 147 (4th Cir. 1990). "
672,14," Merck's and Glenmark's contentions are overlapping. While Defendants generally make similar points, they each also raise 
different arguments. For the sake of simplicity, arguments are occasionally attributed to all Defendants. Moreover, although 
Defendants ascribed their arguments to either antitrust liability or antitrust causation and injury, the Court addresses them in 
connection with the point deemed most material. However, arguments have been considered relevant to both. "
673,15," As used throughout this R. & R., ""branded generic"" is a pharmaceutical product conforming to Merck's definition, that is, a 
generic that is sold under some ""trademark or trade name"" of Merck that is not Zetia. See Sett. Agr. §1.14 (ECF No. 398-21, at 
6). The generic name, ezetimibe, by definition is not a ""trademark or trade name"" of Merck. See [*40] , Daphne E. Smith Marsh,

674,16," Soni's notes are ambiguous about Merck's response to this term. According to those notes, Merck responded on March 1 with 
two months early entry and ""No AG for Zetia: NO,"" (ECF No. 1082-11, at 2). Plaintiffs assert that the NO after the colon ""corresponds to Glenmark's additional request for the Vytorin AG, not the Zetia no-
AG."" Pls.' Opp'n (ECF No. 1156, at 16-17). Defendants contend that the NO refers to Zetia. Merck Reply (ECF No. 1213, at 12). 
Considering that Soni's notes on an earlier demand had been styled as ""No AG Zeta/AG for Vytorin,"" (ECF No. 1082-11, at 2), 
with the two products listed together and separated by a slash, the argument that any words after the colon refer to the second 
Vytorin product is not a reading no reasonable juror could credit. This is especially so given the extensive evidence after 
settlement that Glenmark believed it would have no generic competition from Merck. "
675,17," While some of Plaintiffs' evidence concerns dates after May 2010, Merck's failure to launch a branded generic (and continuing 
to launch AGs) post-2010 could show a jury that Merck was not changing strategy. "
676,18," The dispute over the end date for Glenmark's exclusive generic license relates to language in the licensing terms suggesting it 
lasted until Merck's rights under the patent expired, which Merck asserted was approximately 45 days before Glenmark's first-
filer exclusivity period ended. For purposes of this motion, it's not necessary to determine which period is correct."
676,19," McGuire estimated that Merck would have lost at least $25.5 million during the shorter 135-day timeframe, but also estimated 
it could have been as much as $49.3 million. McGuire Rpt. ¶ 102 (ECF No. 1130-8, at 53). Leffler estimated $62.2 million for the 
same timeframe. Leffler Rpt. ¶ 71 n.84 (ECF No. 1130-4, at 47). "
677,20," Leffler found a cost for Merck of about $160 million during the full 180 days, Leffler Rpt. ¶ 68 (ECF No. 1130-4, at 43-44), but 
also estimated it could have been as low as $89 million, id. ¶ 71 (ECF No. 1130-4, at 46-47). McGuire found a range of $33.9-
$65.7 million for the same timeframe. McGuire Rpt. ¶ 105 (ECF No. 1130-8, at 55)."
677,21," McGuire calculated $62.3 million. McGuire Rpt. ¶ 112 (ECF No. 1130-8, at 58-59)."
677,22," Leffler calculated $125 million. Leffler Rpt. ¶ 70 (ECF No. 1130-4, at 47)."
677,23," In this briefing and associated motions, Defendants occasionally represent that, in 2010, Congress was considering outlawing 
authorized generics during the exclusivity period as anticompetitive. Merck Mem. (ECF No. 1085, at 35) (citing S.3695 (ECF No. 
1084-15); H.R.5993 (ECF No. 1084-16)); see also Defs.' Reply (ECF No. 1201, at 23). However, any arguments that might 
weaken the analogy between a 2016 and 2010 valuation go to the weight of the expert testimony, not admissibility. Cf. E. Term. 
Nat. Gas Co. v. 7.74 Acres, 228 F. App'x 323, 327-29 (4th Cir. 2007) (affirming admission over objections that experts ""did not 
use truly 'comparable' sales to determine the [property] value""). "
678,24," The Settlement Agreement required Glenmark to provide Merck with reasonable documentation of the legal fees. Sett. Agr. ¶ 
7.3 (ECF No. 398-21, at 18). Plaintiffs imply that Glenmark's costs may not have exceeded the full $9 million. See Pls.' Opp'n 
(ECF No. 1156, at 64). "
680,25," Glenmark argues that ""the question of what alternative entry dates the parties may have reached for purposes of causation is 
distinct from the threshold requirement under Actavis that there be an exchange that induced the generic's decision to drop its 
patent challenge."" Glenmark Mem. (ECF No. 1050, at 30). While the court agrees that any opinions on distinct alternative entry 
dates is appropriately a causation issue, in establishing these calculations, experts simultaneously opine on the strength of the 
connection between the no-AG agreement and the date of generic entry. "
682,26," Actavis itself was not a private action but an FTC enforcement action, where causation is not required. Act avis, 570 U.S. at 
136; see also Thompson Everett, Inc. v. National Cable Adv. L.P., 57 F.3d 1317, 1325 (4th Cir. 1995). "
683,27," A generic manufacturer launches ""at risk"" when the 30-month stay imposed by Hatch-Waxman expires — permitting FDA 
approval under the ANDA, but the patent issues remain unresolved. Entry of the allegedly infringing generic then risks the 
ordinary consequences of marketing an infringing product. In re Modafinil Antitrust Litig., 837 F.3d, at 244. "
689,1," Defendants have also filed a motion to stay discovery pending resolution of the motion to dismiss. (Dkt. 51). In light of the 
Court's resolution of the motion to dismiss, the motion to stay is denied as moot. "
692,2," The Court notes that ""the Illinois Brick doctrine is not jurisdictional,"" Mayor & City Council of Baltimore v. AbbVie Inc., 42 F.4th 
709, 710 (7th Cir. 2022), and that it accordingly is not constrained to reach this issue first. "
693,3," Plaintiffs make the entirely conclusory allegation that the new reporting requirement imposed by Sanofi was ""commercially 
unreasonable."" (Dkt. 41 at ¶ 120). However, they have provided no support for that assertion, and this Court is not required to 
credit ""mere conclusory statements"" on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678."
693,4," Plaintiffs contend that this exception was ""commercially infeasible,"" but their explanation for why that is allegedly so is difficult 
to understand. (Dkt. 41 at ¶ 123). Plaintiffs note that the exception requires the contract pharmacy to dispense the products 
without charging a dispensing fee, but then states that the exception was ""virtually meaningless"" because it ""prevented the 
collection of any revenue by a covered entity to offset the dispensing fee the covered entity would have to pay the Contract 
Pharmacy."" (Id.). It is unclear how the covered entity could be required to pay the contract pharmacy a dispensing fee when the 
exception prohibits the contract pharmacy from charging a dispensing fee."
693,5," In their opposition papers, Plaintiffs cite to paragraph 121 of the amended complaint to assert that ""Eli Lilly stopped shipping 
340B-discounted drugs to Contract Pharmacies beginning on September 1, 2020, with a claimed single-pharmacy exception 
where a covered entity does not have an in-house pharmacy."" (Dkt. 58 at ¶ 22). However, paragraph 121 of the amended 
complaint makes no mention of a limitation to a single pharmacy. Further, a review of the actual letter that Eli Lilly sent to HHS—
which Plaintiff references and quotes from in the amended complaint—shows that no such single-pharmacy limitation is set forth 
therein. (See Dkt. 47-4 at 2-4). Defendants confirm that Eli Lilly's policy ""allows unlimited contract pharmacies if certain 
requirements are met."" (Dkt. 66 at 18). "
722,1," The operative pleading also alleges violations of various state statutes. At a pretrial conference of September 21, 2021, this 
Court stayed the filing of any motions directed to the several state law claims of the Attorneys General, thereby permitting the 
parties and the Court to focus on the federal antitrust claims. See Pre-Trial Order No. 1 ¶ 11 (Aug 13, 2021; Docket # 4)."
722,2," The action does not relate to other forms of advertising on the internet, including targeted text-based ads sold by search 
engines, video ads that run before or during video content or sharable ads on social media platforms."
722,3," See Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 395 U.S. 100, 130, 89 S. Ct. 1562, 23 L. Ed. 2d 129 (1969) (plaintiff must 
""demonstrate a significant threat of injury from an impending violation of the antitrust laws or from a contemporary violation likely 
to continue or recur.""). Google separately asserts that by reason of unreasonable delay and prejudice, certain claims are barred 
by laches. "
724,4," The Court recognize that Google's activities - e.g., licensing of software, conduct of auctions, furnishing of technical support - 
are services rather than products, but will use the terminology ""product"" market in conformity with the parties' usage and the 
practice utilized in most case law. "
725,5," According to the Complaint, ""most"" small publishers do not need an ad server. (Id. ¶ 97.) The Complaint does not demarcate 
small publishers from large ones. Small publishers often sell their ad inventory to a ""web display ad network"" or ""ad network"" 
which, in turn, sells that inventory to advertisers. (Id. ¶ 65.) Networks are middlemen holding inventory risk. (Id. ¶ 66.) Sales are 
not conducted through real-time auctions but are direct sales by the network to small advertisers. Google describes its ad 
network, known as the Google Display Network or GDN, as ""the largest ad network in the world."" (Id. ¶ 69.) Google's margin 
on network sales is typically 32-40% of each transaction. (Id.) "
726,6," According to the Complaint, ""[t]he exchange market is also characterized by market exit and lack of recent entry. Microsoft 
(AdECN) exited the exchange market in 2011, Yahoo! (RMX) in 2015, and Facebook (FBX) in 2016."" (Id. ¶ 159.) A new entrant 
would have to achieve sufficient scale among both publishers and advertisers to be viable. (Id. ¶ 160.) "
728,7," The States employ much of the antitrust lexicon and other colorful prose in the body of their Complaint, e.g., ""anticompetitive 
acts"" (Compl't ¶ 7), ""substantial anticompetitive harm"" (Id. ¶ 18), ""brazenly unlawful"" (Id. ¶18), ""extraction of monopoly profits"" 
(Id. ¶ 18), ""coercive tactics"" (Id. ¶ 19), ""auction-manipulation programs"" (Id. ¶ 21), ""reduced output"" ""exit of rival firms"" (Id. ¶ 502), 
""exclusionary conduct"" (Id. ¶ 505), ""foreclosure of competition"" (Id. ¶ 519), ""allocate markets"" (Id. ¶ 544). These legal labels are 
useful in framing a legal theory but, in assessing whether the facts alleged plausibly state a claim, they are not afforded the 
presumption of truth. "
730,8," Google urges that this allegation should be read as merely requiring a publisher to enter into a contract that permitted the 
publisher to decide whether it wishes to include either or both DFP and AdX. (8/31 Tr. at 14-15.) HN8[
] But on a motion to 
dismiss, the Court accepts as true the States' non-conclusory factual allegations and draws all reasonable inferences in their 
favor. The Court accepts the allegation as it is most naturally read: publishers were required to sign a contract for both products."
730,9," It has long been recognized that section 1 ""reaches only unreasonable restraints"" of trade. E & L Consulting, 472 F.3d at 29 
(quotation marks omitted). "
731,10," In the Complaint and briefing on the motion, the NBA is often referred to as the ""Jedi Blue"" agreement, a purported 
""codename"" used by Google. (Compl't ¶¶ 26, 425.) The Star Wars reference refers to Google and ""Blue"" to Facebook, the color 
of Facebook's logo. (Id.)"
731,11," The NBA is cited and quoted in the text of the Complaint and thus may be considered on Google's motion to dismiss. DiFolco 
v. MSNBC Cable L.L.C., 622 F.3d 104, 111 (2d Cir. 2010) (on a motion to dismiss, a court may consider documents 
incorporated by reference in the complaint and documents that the complaint heavily relies upon, rendering it integral to the 
complaint)."
731,12," The Court's conclusion that the States have not plausibly alleged an unlawful agreement between Google and Facebook to 
substantially curtail Facebook's use of header bidding dispenses with the need to decide whether such an agreement should be 
an analyzed as a horizontal or vertical agreement. Compare Complaint ¶¶ 423-424, alleging that Facebook was a potential 
competitor in certain relevant markets, with the NBA, the entire thrust of which is directed to Facebook as a user of Google's 
services. "
734,13, The States alternatively plead that the arrangements between Google and Facebook fail under a rule of reason analysis.
734,14," The States acknowledge that the NBA only applies to in-app impressions offered by third parties and not to any that Google or 
Facebook offer for sale. (States' Mem. at 27 (citing NBA ¶ 1.55).) "
735,15," See also Texaco Inc. v. Dagher, 547 U.S. 1, 5, 126 S. Ct. 1276, 164 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2006) (""[T]his Court presumptively applies 
rule of reason analysis . . . .""); F.T.C. v. Indiana Fed'n of Dentists, 476 U.S. 447, 458-59, 106 S. Ct. 2009, 90 L. Ed. 2d 445 
(1986) (the Supreme Court has been slow ""in general, to extend per se analysis to restraints imposed in the context of business 
relationships where the economic impact of certain practices is not immediately obvious. . . .""); E & L Consulting, 472 F.3d at 29 
(per se rule applies to a ""small class of actions."")."
735,16," In its brief but not in the Complaint, the States argue that Google is penalized if Facebook does not achieve the target win rate. 
(States' Mem. at 31.) The cited provision applies only if the shortfall is ""due to Google's categorization"" of certain data, and not 
because of the bidding practices of Google or Facebook. (NBA ¶ 6.10.) "
736,17," See K.M.B. Warehouse, 61 F.3d at 128 (""[A]n examination of the intrabrand market belies even [plaintiff's] assertion that 
intrabrand competition has been harmed. There are over twenty Walker distributors of various size in the Tri-state area.""). "
737,18," While every pleading stands on its own footing, pleadings alleging rule of reason violations are frequently dismissed for failure 
to adequately allege market harm. See, e.g. Cinema Vill. Cinemart, Inc. v. Regal Ent. Grp., 15 cv 05488 (RJS), 2016 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 135941, 2016 WL 5719790, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 29, 2016) (Sullivan, J.) (dismissing complaint in part for failure to 
adequately plead actual market harm sufficient to show an unreasonable restraint of trade), aff'd, 708 Fed. App'x 29 (2d Cir. 
2017); Wellnx Life Sciences Inc. v. Iovate Health Sciences Research Inc., 516 F. Supp. 2d 270, 293-95 (S.D.N.Y. 2007) 
(dismissing section 1 claim because complaint failed to plausibly allege adverse effects on price, output or quality of services); 
IDT Corp. v. Bldg. Owners & Managers Ass'n Int'l, 03-4113 (JAG), 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 33208, 2005 WL 3447615, at *12 
(D.N.J. Dec. 15, 2005) (dismissal for failure to plausibly allege anticompetitive effects)."
737,19," The claim is pled in the alternative to its monopolization claim for ad exchanges and ad-buying tools for small advertisers. 
(Compl't ¶ 532.) "
738,20," Examples of anticompetitive conduct include engaging in price manipulation to harm rivals after obtaining a dominant market 
position, as well as conduct that harms competitors with no legitimate economic justification to the monopolist. See In re Crude 
Oil Commodity Futures Litig., 913 F. Supp. 2d 41, 56 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) (Pauley, J.). Using monopoly power to boost sales through 
consumer coercion - as opposed to persuasion - also constitutes improper conduct. Actavis, 787 F.3d at 654-55. "
739,21," Google has urged that any allegation of deceptive conduct must satisfy the particularity required by Rule 9(b) and demonstrate 
actual harm to competition, pointing to Judge Sand's decision in Michael Anthony Jewelers, Inc. v. Peacock Jewelry, Inc., 795 F. 
Supp. 639 (S.D.N.Y. 1992). (See 8/31/22 Tr. at 65; Google Reply at 26.) The section 2 claim in Michael Anthony Jewelers 
""relie[d] heavily"" on the anticompetitive effects of allegedly false and fraudulent statements of originality filed with the Copyright 
Office. Id. at 643-44, 649. Judge Sand concluded that the Complaint satisfied Rule 9(b) by attaching the allegedly fraudulent 
copyright filings and alleging scienter. Id. at 649-50. Here, Rule 9(b) has no role because the States do not assert that Google's 
purported section 2 violations sound in fraud and the purportedly deceptive conduct described in the Complaint is offered as 
context. See, e.g., Hinds Cnty., Miss. v. Wachovia Bank N.A., 700 F. Supp. 2d 378, 391-92 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (concluding that 
Rule 9(b) played no role in antitrust-conspiracy claim centered on bid-rigging and price-fixing, as opposed to acts of fraud) 
(Marrero, J.). "
741,22," See Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., 472 U.S. 585, 105 S. Ct. 2847, 86 L. Ed. 2d 467 (1985). ""Aspen 
Skiing is at or near the outer boundary of § 2 liability."" Trinko, 540 U.S. at 409. "
744,23," The program was named for former Federal Reserve Chairman Benjamin Bernanke, and an internal Google document 
described the project as ""Quantitative Easing on the AdExchange."" (Compl't ¶¶ 298, 317.) "
747,24," N95 masks may be a lower-price, higher-volume product than a luxury good directed to a narrow segment of the market. 
Rational considerations may cause the seller of masks to place a higher bid than the seller of luxury goods. One product might 
be of greater prestige than the other, but all are susceptible to false claims that require some degree of policing by publishers. "
748,25," The Court understands ""adverse selection"" in this context to mean the asymmetry of information between publishers and AdX."
748,26," The Complaint tends to lump in a single section its allegations of competitive harm (""Anticompetitive Effects"") in a particular 
market from all conduct alleged to be anticompetitive conduct. See, e.g. Section VIII.B (Compl't ¶¶ 502-542). While this may be 
somewhat understandable because of the perceived synergy of discrete actions, at times it makes it more difficult for a Court to 
analyze whether particular conduct of Google is plausibly alleged to be anticompetitive. "
749,27," The Star Wars reference apparently arose from an internal discussion about the ""need to create a jedi mind trick"" in order ""to 
get publishers to come up with the idea to remove exchanges from PreBid on their own."" (Compl't ¶¶ 385-86.) "
759,28," See State of New York, 549 F.3d at 40 (""Although the doctrine of laches therefore applies to parens patriae suits such as this 
one, the Court does not mean to suggest that the presence of state plaintiffs has zero effect on the analysis. Laches is an 
equitable doctrine, and in the balancing of the equities, it is of course relevant that this suit is brought not by a competitor hoping 
to seriously interfere with a rival's business operations, but rather by many of the states of the Union."") (quotation marks 
omitted). "
762,1," The State Bar's unopposed request for judicial notice (""RJN"") of three documents is granted. See Dkt. 39. Plaintiffs also filed a 
RJN and Supplemental RJN, see Dkts. 57, 70, which the State Bar moved to strike, see Dkt. 84. The Court declines to rule on 
those motions because the documents were not necessary in resolving the Motion to Dismiss. If Plaintiffs decide to amend, 
however, they should not request the Court take judicial notice of facts that are subject to reasonable dispute. See FRE 201. "
763,2," Because the Motions to Dismiss make similar arguments, the Court will exclusively refer to the State Bar's motion. "
772,1," BRF often refers to itself as UHS, which can be confusing. Throughout most of this opinion, the distinction between UHS and 
BRF isn't important. So we generally use the term ""BRF"" to refer to both BRF itself and to UHS while under BRF's management. 
We use the term ""UHS"" only when the distinction between the hospital and its (former) managing company makes a difference. "
775,2," BRF's complaint also contains allegations about Dr. Ghali Ghali, who was appointed as LSU's chancellor in 2016. BRF says 
Ghali was unqualified for the job and functioned as Willis-Knighton's ""agent,"" undermining BRF and responding to Willis-
Knighton's whims. Because we assume for the sake of argument that BRF plausibly alleged noncooperation from LSU, and because Ghali's 
alleged actions were merely means to the end of non-cooperation, we need not evaluate the plausibility of these allegations. To 
the extent BRF suggests that Ghali's appointment somehow independently establishes an agreement between Willis-Knighton 
and LSU, we reject the suggestion as an ""unwarranted factual inference[]."" Great Lakes Dredge & Dock, 624 F.3d at 210 
(quotation omitted). BRF tries to avoid this result by rewriting its complaint on appeal. Its brief says Willis-Knighton ""assert[ed] 
that it was willing to donate funds to [LSU] only if a person it approved was appointed as LSU's chancellor."" But that's not what 
the complaint says. The complaint merely says Willis-Knighton refused to donate until (a) it knew who the next chancellor would 
be, and (b) it knew LSU was going to cooperate more than it had in the past."
775,3," For this reason, it doesn't matter that the complaint contains scattered mentions of Willis-Knighton's pre-2016 behavior. That 
includes, for example, an allegation that Willis-Knighton's funding strategy was a ""longstanding position"" and that, in 2012 and 
2013, Willis-Knighton's CEO ""stated to the Willis-Knighton Board that Willis-Knighton would only continue its current level of 
funding to LSU 'provided that [Willis-Knighton] and LSU Health remain partners, not competitors.'"" It also includes an allegation 
that Willis-Knighton told LSU's then-dean in 2015 that, if he attended a meeting with BRF, Willis-Knighton would stop funding 
LSU. The complaint is clear that any such moves wouldn't have a meaningfully coercive effect on LSU in the absence of a budget 
crisis. We take the complaint at its word. "
777,4," BRF also suggests that Willis-Knighton attempted to raise BRF's costs. See Thomas Krattenmaker & Steven Salop, 
Anticompetitive Exclusion: Raising Rivals' Costs to Achieve Power Over Price, 96 Yale L.J. 209 (1986) (arguing that taking 
actions to raise a rival's costs can sometimes amount to a Section 2 violation). We don't doubt that raised costs can be a form of 
antitrust injury in cases where the defendant has already violated antitrust law in some other way. See Premier Elec. Constr. 
Co. v. Nat'l Elec. Contractors Ass'n, 814 F.2d 358, 368 (7th Cir. 1987) (Easterbrook, J.) (discussing raised costs along these 
lines). But we are skeptical of raised costs as a standalone theory. See PHILLIP E. AREEDA & HERBERT HOVENKAMP, ANTITRUST 
LAW: AN ANALYSIS OF ANTITRUST PRINCIPLES AND THEIR APPLICATION § 651 (2022) (describing raising rivals costs as a ""sometimes 
useful but also incomplete definition of exclusionary practices.""). Regardless, in this case, it's clear that the only way Willis-
Knighton might have raised BRF's costs is through its exclusive-dealing arrangement with LSU. BRF's raised-costs argument 
therefore stands or falls with its exclusive-dealing theory. We need not decide whether raised costs can ever function as a 
standalone Section 2 theory. "

798,7," All of Plaintiffs' claims are based on North Carolina law. However, as noted below, in analyzing these claims it is permissible for 
the Court to consider federal antitrust cases that it deems to be instructive. "
800,8," Defendants also argue that Plaintiffs are too ""differently situated to have standing"" to raise any of the claims in the Complaint. 
(ECF No. 28, at p. 34.) However, the Court is unpersuaded by this argument as well."
800,9," N.C.G.S. § 75-2 states that ""[a]ny act, contract, combination in the form of trust, or conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce

805,11," Although Defendants contend that the contractual provisions at issue are actually procompetitive rather than anticompetitive, 
the Court cannot make such a determination at the pleadings stage. During discovery, Defendants will have a full and fair 
opportunity to establish the procompetitive benefits of these provisions. See Robertson v. Sea Pines Real Estates Cos., 679 
F.3d 278, 292 (4th Cir. 2012) (HN22[
] ""At this early stage of the litigation, we are not in a position to weigh the alleged 
anticompetitive risks of the [challenged conduct] against their procompetitive justifications. This rule of reason inquiry is best 
conducted with the benefit of discovery and we thus express no view on the merits of the litigation beyond recognizing the 
sufficiency of the complaints.""); Dicesare, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 33, at *52-53 (cleaned up) (""In its briefs, the Hospital conflates 
Plaintiffs' initial burden of proving an adverse effect on competition with the ultimate determination of whether those 
anticompetitive effects outweigh any procompetitive benefits that may be offered by Defendant. At this stage of the proceeding, 
however, the Court is required to take the allegations of the [Complaint] as true and all contravening assertions in the Answer as 
false. Thus, Plaintiffs' allegations of adverse effects on competition must be accepted as true, and Defendant's pro-competitive 
justifications considered unproven."")."
805,12," Defendants also raise an argument that some of Plaintiffs' claims are untimely based on the applicable statute of limitations. 
However, because none of the claims asserted in the Complaint are time-barred on their face, the Court deems this argument to 
be premature. "
806,13," Indeed, such a position would be difficult to maintain given the General Assembly's enactment of the COPA laws and the 
protection to Mission provided therein from antitrust liability."
806,14," Indeed, the whole essence of Plaintiffs' tying theory is that Defendants seek to require insurers to include in their networks 
Defendants' facilities in markets besides the Asheville Region Inpatient Services market. "

is positioned vertically or is complementary to the products and services in the relevant market."" U.S. Dep't of Justice & Fed. 
Trade Comm'n, Vertical Merger Guidelines 3 (2020). This item is called a ""related product,"" and it ""could be an input, a means of 
distribution, access to a set of customers, or a complement."" Id. Here, the related product is EDI clearinghouse services. See 
8/9/22 AM Trial Tr. 45:1-15 (Gowrisankaran). "
890,4," To illustrate, suppose before a merger a market is highly competitive—to use overly simplified math, call it 50-50. Further 
suppose that, following the merger and without the divestiture, the market would be highly anticompetitive—using the same 
simplified math, call it 95-5. But also imagine that the divestiture would result in a market that is highly competitive, but just a little 
less competitive than the market before the merger and divestiture—call it 51-49. Under the Government's proposed standard 
(or at least its most aggressive version), the merger would be enjoined because the companies would be unable to prove that 
the divestiture fully restored the pre-merger level competition. That would be true even though the merger (with the divestiture) 
would cause only the slightest lessening of competition, not a substantial lessening."
890,5," The Court agrees with UHG that the relevant transaction here is the proposed acquisition agreement including the proposed 
divestiture. As discussed above, treating the acquisition and the divestiture as separate transactions that must be analyzed in 
separate steps allows the government to meet its prima facie burden based on a fictional transaction and fictional market shares. "
891,," And here, without the benefit of the market-share presumption, the Government cannot meet its prima facie burden of proving 
that the combined effect of the proposed merger and the divestiture is likely to substantially lessen competition. "
894,6," The evidence established, and the Court finds, that ClaimsXten was a standalone product at McKesson and has continued to 
be a standalone product at Change. 8/11/22 AM Trial Tr. 17:1-18:22 (Wukitch). As Wukitch put it, ClaimsXten is not ""technically 
integrated with any other products,"" and ""[i]t doesn't require anything from another part of Change Healthcare to be successful in 
the market."" Id. at 18:13-17. The evidence established, and the Court finds, that the divestiture package comprised ""the full suite 
. . . needed to have a successful claims editing business"" post-divestiture. Id. at 40:17-22. "
895,7," TPG need not replicate exactly how Change goes about competing. The relevant antitrust market here is the market for first-
pass claims editing solutions, not the market for other payment-accuracy products, and thus the analysis must focus on TPG's 
ability to replicate Change's competitive intensity in the market for first-pass claims editing. That TPG will be unable to replicate 
Change's broader ""end-to-end"" strategy is irrelevant; the Government has offered zero evidence that customers would be less 
likely to purchase ClaimsXten absent the option to purchase other payment accuracy products. Nor has it offered any other 
evidence that Change's bundled offering is what drives ClaimsXten's success. "
896,8," A divestiture ordered by a federal court ""in an action brought by the Federal Trade Commission or the Department of Justice"" is

896,9," By ""misuse,"" the Court means the claim that United would use its competitors' data for anticompetitive purposes. The Court 
appreciates the Government's position that United need not violate applicable law or company policy to appropriate rival payers' 
claims data. "
898,10," Dr. Gowrisankaran did quantify the percentage of post-acquisition data for which Change has (and Optum will have if the 
acquisition goes through) secondary-use rights. See PX-820 Ex. 10. But he did not quantify how much of the data would be new 
to Optum—that is, he did not quantify how the data are different from what are already available to Optum. "
900,11," When asked whether United planned to reverse course and use Change's payer data to benefit UHC, every single witness 
answered—credibly and without equivocation—that United would never do so. See, e.g., 8/10/22 PM Trial Tr. 28:2-24 (Witty);

903,12," At trial, Dr. Gowrisankaran suggested that UHC may use its rivals' CSI to assist its underwriting practices, which may harm 
competition in ways other than reducing innovation. See 8/9/22 AM Trial Tr. 97:10-24 (Gowrisankaran). But for reasons 
discussed above, the Government has not proven that UHG is likely to misuse its rivals' CSI. "

917,8," Plaintiff's Amended Complaint also alleges that defendant is attempting to monopolize — and in some circumstances does monopolize — the residential real estate market 
through its burgeoning direct purchase program whereby defendant purchases title to properties for itself through a sales 
process that is inaccessible to plaintiff, and others similarly situated, which allows defendant to self-validate its own artificial 
Zestimates and unfairly control the market. (Am. Compl. ¶ 38l.) However, there is no mention anywhere else in the Amended Complaint of this ""direct purchase program,"" 
nor does Plaintiff allege facts permitting a plausible inference that this program harms market consumers by manipulating prices. "

Mar. 29, 2019) as Exhibit 4. Plaintiffs do not dispute that the Court may properly consider judicial opinions for a limited purpose. 
See Lum v. Bank of Am., 361 F.3d 217, 222 n.3 (3d Cir. 2004) (""While a prior judicial opinion constitutes a public record of which 
a court may take judicial notice, it may do so on a motion to dismiss only to establish the existence of the opinion, not for the 
truth of the facts asserted in the opinion."")."
927,2," Courts have explained the rationale for the exception to the general rule: ""[T]he justification for the integral documents 
exception is that it is not unfair to hold a plaintiff accountable for the contents of documents it must have used in framing its 
complaint, nor should a plaintiff be able to evade accountability for such documents simply by not attaching them to his 
complaint."" Schmidt, 770 F.3d at 250; see also Pension Benefit Guar. Corp., 998 F.2d at 1196 (""Otherwise, a plaintiff with a 
legally deficient claim could survive a motion to dismiss simply by failing to attach a dispositive document on which it relied.""); In 
re Burlington Coat Factory Sec. Litig., 114 F.3d at 1426 (""Plaintiffs cannot prevent a court from looking at the texts of the 
documents on which its claim is based by failing to attach or explicitly cite them.""). "
928,3," Defendant Great American argues that, despite what is alleged in the Amended Complaint, there is no contractual relationship 
between it and Plaintiffs. Instead, Defendant Great American argues that Plaintiffs obtained a mortgage from Defendant Siwell 
(doing business as Capital Mortgage of Texas) for the properties in dispute, and Exhibit 1 is the insurance policy—referenced in 
Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint—which is actually a contract between Defendant Great American and Defendant Siwell covering 
only Defendant Siwell's interest in Plaintiffs' property. (Dkt. No. 29 at 1-2, 8-11)."
928,4," Plaintiffs first argue that the Court should not consider Exhibit 1 because it was not submitted with an authenticating affidavit. 
(Dkt. No. 38 at 2-3). While the document was initially submitted without an accompanying authenticating affidavit, on reply, 
Defendant Siwell submitted a ""Declaration Under Oath"" from Craig Zahn, the Director of Default Mortgage Servicing for 
Defendant Siwell. (Dkt. No. 53-1). Mr. Zahn states that he has ""reviewed the document filed in this matter by Defendant Great 
American Assurance Company on October 5, 2020 as Document No. 29-1, and compared it to documents in the files of Siwell. It 
is a true and correct copy of a Notice of Lender Placed Homeowners (Hazard) Coverage, dated January 19, 2017, from Siwell to 
the plaintiff Thomas Ainger."" (Dkt. No. 53-1 at 2)."
928,5," Plaintiffs' objection to the document in this regard appears to be that the Notice of Insurance is addressed to ""Ainger Thomas"" 
instead of Thomas Ainger. (Dkt. No. 38 at 3)."
928,6," Of course, as with everything else, Rule 11 would continue to govern. "
930,7," Plaintiffs also argue that the Court should not consider Exhibit 2 because it was not submitted with an authenticating affidavit. 
(Dkt. No. 38 at 2-3). As noted earlier, while the document was initially submitted without an accompanying authenticating 
affidavit, on reply Defendant Siwell submitted a ""Declaration of Counsel."" (Dkt. No. 53-2). In the Declaration, counsel for 
Defendant Siwell states based on his ""own personal knowledge that Docket Entry No 29-2 is a true and correct copy of a 
Mortgage recorded at the office of the Recorder on March 21, 2013 as Doc. No. 2013000924."" Id. at 2."
930,8," The parties dispute whether Exhibit 2 is ""integral to the dispute."" (Dkt Nos. 29 at 9; 38 at 5). However, for purposes of Exhibit 2, 
proffered under the public record exception, the question is whether the proffered document is a public record, not whether it 
meets the criteria for the integral document exception."
930,9, The Court notes that the parties do not dispute that Virgin Islands law applies to this matter.
930,10," In Banks, the Virgin Islands Supreme Court held that, in the absence of precedent on a common law rule established by the 
Supreme Court of the Virgin Islands, courts in the Virgin Islands must conduct what has become known as a ""Banks analysis"" to 
determine which legal standard to adopt. See Gumbs-Heyliger v. CMW & Assocs. Corp., 73 F. Supp. 3d 617, 625 (D.V.I. 2014) 
(citing Better Bldg. Maint. of the V.I., Inc. v. Lee, 60 V.I. 740, 757 (2014)). ""In conducting a Banks analysis, a court balances 
'three non-dispositive factors': (1) whether any courts [in the Virgin Islands] have previously adopted a particular rule; (2) the 
position taken by a majority of courts from other jurisdictions; and (3) most importantly, which approach represents the soundest 
rule for the Virgin Islands."" Id. (citing Simon v. Joseph, 59 V.I. 611, 623 (2013))."
930,11," Rule 22(m) provides, in part: ""Issues that were . . . raised or objected to but not briefed, or . . . are only adverted to in a 
perfunctory manner or unsupported by argument and citation to legal authority, are deemed waived for purposes of appeal . . . ."" 
V.I. Rule App. P. 22(m). "
931,12," While there are references in the Amended Complaint to a mortgage debt between Plaintiffs and Defendant Siwell, Plaintiffs 
do not argue that their breach of contract claim is based on the mortgage agreement. Indeed, Plaintiffs criticize Defendant Great 
American for making ""the bald unsupported claim that [the mortgage document] is 'integral to the dispute.'"" (Dkt. No. 38 at 5)."
931,13," Defendant Siwell argues that ""[a]lthough the caption refers to breach of contract, this count actually appears to allege 
fraudulent misrepresentation."" (Dkt. No. 35 at 8). The Court addresses the potential claim for fraudulent misrepresentation 
below. "
932,14," Defendant Siwell interprets the claim titled ""Estoppel"" in the Complaint to mean ""promissory estoppel"" (Dkt. No. 35 at 10), and 
Plaintiffs do not dispute that characterization, (Dkt. No. 48 at 12). "
933,15," Plaintiffs take issue with the completeness of the Banks analysis conducted in Merchants Com. Bank. (Dkt. No. 48 at 9 n.20). 
Specifically, Plaintiffs argue that the Merchants court makes statements about majority positions, without supporting citations 
that show all of those majority positions. Id. The Court disagrees with Plaintiffs' argument that the Banks analysis in Merchants 
was inadequate. It is clear that the court in Merchants was citing several cases as examples of the majority position, as opposed 
to citing each case constituting the majority position. Nothing precludes such an approach. Regardless, since Merchants, other 
Virgin Islands courts have affirmed the Banks analysis performed in Merchants and adopted the same elements. See Turnbull v. 
Univ. of the Virgin Islands, No. ST-07-CV-239, 2016 V.I. LEXIS 22, 2016 WL 1047893, at *4 & n.6 (V.I. Super. Ct. Mar. 2, 2016) 
(""[T[he Court is persuaded that Judge Francois's Banks analysis in Merchants is sound and adopts her holding as its own 
here.""); Fuller v. Roswell Properties LLC, Ltd., No. ST-16-CV-438, 2018 V.I. LEXIS 27, 2018 WL 1176867, at *5 (V.I. Super. Ct. 
Mar. 5, 2018) (""The Court adopts the Superior Court's analysis in Merchants Bank . . . to prove liability for negligent 
misrepresentation . . . .""). "
937,16," The Court notes that courts within the Virgin Islands have also permitted claims for breach of the covenant of good faith and 
fair dealing to proceed without a showing of fraud or deceit. See, e.g., Merchants Com. Bank, 64 V.I. at 35 (""[A] party breaches 
the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by taking actions that deprive another party of the benefits for which it had 
bargained. The soundest rule of law for the Virgin Islands is that allegations of same are sufficient to allege a plausible breach of 
said covenant.""); Arvidson v. Buchar, 71 V.I. 277, 337 (V.I. Super. Ct. 2019) (""To prevail under the Virgin Islands' iteration of this 
claim, [the plaintiff] must show that (1) a valid contract exists between the parties and (2) acts committed by the [defendant] 
amount to fraud or deceit or an unreasonable contravention of the parties' reasonable expectations under the contract."" 
(emphasis added)); Firstbank P.R. v. Webster, No. ST-12-CV-239, 2013 V.I. LEXIS 5, at *8 (V.I. Super. Ct. Jan. 17, 2013) 
(""Defendants had a reasonable expectation that their private financial information, submitted to Firstbank in order to acquire a 
loan, would remain confidential. As a result. Defendants' allegation that Firstbank improperly disclosed their private financial 
information to a third party states a viable claim for breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing that is sufficient to survive a 
motion to dismiss.""). However, the Court will follow the instruction of the Virgin Islands Supreme Court, that the claim requires a 
showing of fraud or deceit. "
938,17," Specifically, the statute states: (a) The Commissioner may review any health property or casualty insurance rate to determine if there is an actuarial basis 
for it [*37]  and if it is supported by actual and credible loss and expense statistics or, if new coverage, by reasonable 
projections of losses and expenses. Pre-approval of rates is not required, but the Commissioner shall be notified 30 days in 
advance of the effective date of any rate increase. (b) If the Commissioner determines that there is not sufficient evidence to justify a new rate, he may disallow the rate 
increase. The reason for the rejection must be in writing. An aggrieved carrier may demand a hearing pursuant to this 
chapter to reconsider the ruling and may appeal from the Commissioner's order refusing a hearing or an order on hearing to 
the District Court. The appeal must be taken within 30 days."
938,22, V.I.C. § 53a. 
939,18," Additionally, while Defendant Siwell argues that the Amended Complaint fails to allege ""how Siwell was supposed to know that 
the premiums were excessive,"" this is not an element of the claim of unjust enrichment. "
940,19," The Superior Court in Donstorg also recognized a second test for when a plaintiff alleges a claim of negligent infliction of 
emotional distress under a theory that the plaintiff witnessed the defendant cause injury to a third party. 63 V.I. at 314-15. There 
are no allegations here that Plaintiffs witnessed any injury to a third party. This test is therefore inapplicable to the current matter. "
941,20," This Court has previously held that ""the tort of negligent infliction of emotional distress requires that: (1) the plaintiff was in 
danger of his or her own safety; (2) the plaintiff suffered some physical harm; and (3) the physical harm was a result of the 
emotional distress."" Liburd v. Gov't of the Virgin Islands, Civil Action No. 2011-020, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 34658, at *37 (D.V.I. 
Mar. 13, 2013); see also Currence, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 158656, 2018 WL 4473579, at *3 (Gómez, J.). Defendant AFG argues 
that such a standard applies. (Dkt. No. 31 at 14 (citing Int'l Islamic Cmty. of Masjid Baytulkhaliq, Inc. v. United States, 981 F. 
Supp. 352, 370, 37 V.I. 287 (D.V.I. 1997), aff'd 176 F.3d 472 (3d Cir. 1999) and Lempert v. Singer, 766 F. Supp. 1356, 26 V.I. 
380 (D.V.I. 1991)). However, the Superior Court in performing its Banks analyses has rejected those requirements. See Diaz, 67 
V.I. at 94 (""This Court also agrees with the growing minority and the Virgin Islands Courts that have abandoned the physical 
injury and 'zone of danger' requirements. Physical injury and presence in the 'zone of danger' should not be required for 
recovery, but should be allowed as evidence that a plaintiff has suffered a severe or serious emotional injury.""); Donastorg, 63 
V.I. at 313 (""It should be noted that a plaintiff's presence in the zone of danger and the manifestation of physical symptoms may 
still constitute evidence that a plaintiff has suffered a severe or serious emotional injury. . . . However, neither fact is a 
prerequisite for recover[y] under a theory of negligent infliction of emotional distress in this jurisdiction.""). "
944,21," The Court notes that its finding in this regard does not mean that Title 22 and the duties imposed thereunder are irrelevant to 
Plaintiffs' claims. Title 22 may speak to the applicable legal duties and standards of care at issue in Plaintiff's common law 
causes of action. See, e.g., Charleswell, 308 F. Supp. 2d at 564-65; FirstBank P.R. v. Ainger, 74 V.I. 350, 359-60 (V.I. Super. Ct. 
2021) (finding bank breached a duty of care under 22 V.I.C. § 1201(a)). "
947,22," While the Third Circuit discussed this theory of liability in the context of a labor dispute, the principle has been applied in other 
contexts. See Esmark, Inc., 887 F.2d at 756 (""[A] parent corporation may be held liable for the wrongdoing of a subsidiary where 
the parent directly participated in the subsidiary's unlawful actions. Under this 'transaction-specific' theory of direct participation, 
parent companies have been held liable for a wide variety of misconduct by subsidiaries: patent or copyright infringement, false 
advertising, fraud, conversion, and the creation of a nuisance."")."
947,23," The Court notes that while Plaintiffs have cited Virgin Islands cases discussing corporate veil-piercing as a form of liability, 
Plaintiffs have not cited any Virgin Islands cases discussing their theory of direct liability. "
948,24," Defendant AFG also argues that ""all of Plaintiffs' tort claims fail as a matter of law because they are not independent from 
Plaintiffs' breach of contract claims"" under the gist of the action doctrine. (Dkt. No. 31 at 12). ""[T]he gist of the action doctrine 
precludes tort suits for the mere breach of contractual duties unless the plaintiff can point to separate or independent events 
giving rise to the tort."" Addie v. Kjaer, 737 F.3d 854, 866, 60 V.I. 881 (3d Cir. 2013). While the Supreme Court of the Virgin 
Islands has not spoken to the application of the doctrine, other courts have held that the gist of the action doctrine is the law in 
the Virgin Islands. See Addie, 737 F.3d at 866 (holding that the gist of the action doctrine is applicable in the Virgin Islands); 
Pollara v. Chateau St. Croix, LLC, No. SX-06-CV-423, 2016 V.I. LEXIS 49, 2016 WL 2865874, at *6 (V.I. Super. Ct. May 3, 
2016) (conducting Banks analysis and holding that the gist of the action doctrine was the soundest rule for the Virgin Islands); 
Franken v. Bradley Sisneros & Conundrum Mktg., LLC, No. ST-15-CV-88, 2016 V.I. LEXIS 248, 2016 WL 11723593, at *5 (V.I. 
Super. Ct. Apr. 18, 2016) (conducting Banks analysis and ""find[ing] no reason to upset . . . application [of the gist of the action 
doctrine] as the doctrine serves to promote judicial efficiency""); XO Bistro, LLC, 2021 V.I. LEXIS 58, 2021 WL 3214788, at *8 
(following Banks analysis performed in Franken). ""Generally, courts apply the gist of the action doctrine when the claims are (1) arising solely from a contract between the parties; 
(2) where the duties allegedly breached were created and grounded in the contract itself; (3) where liability stems from a 
contract; or (4) where the tort claim essentially duplicates a breach of contact claim or the success of which is wholly dependent 
on the terms of a contract."" Addie, 737 F.3d at 866. However, courts have noted that whether to apply the gist of the action 
doctrine to bar claims requires examination of the facts. Addie, 737 F.3d at 868 (""Application of this doctrine frequently requires 
courts to engage in a factually intensive inquiry as to the nature of a plaintiff's claims.""); Franken, 2016 V.I. LEXIS 248, 2016 WL 
11723593, at *5 (""As Virgin Islands courts have identified, whether an asserted duty arises out of a contractual relationship or 
out of a duty generally imposed by society often remains a fact-intensive inquiry""). Given the lack of any factual development at 
this stage in the case, the Court is not prepared to hold—as suggested by Defendant AFG (Dkt. No. 31 at 12)—that Plaintiffs' tort 
theories are precluded as a matter of law under the gist of the action doctrine. See Jefferson v. Bay Isles Assocs., L.L.L.P., 59 
V.I. 31, 52 (V.I. Super. Ct. 2011) (holding it would be ""premature"" to dismiss counts based on the gist of the action doctrine at 
the motion to dismiss stage without the aid of discovery); Joseph v. Divine Funeral Services, LLC, 71 V.I. 121, 130 (V.I. Super. 
Ct. 2019) (""Without evidence as to whether the contract of the parties included terms relating to the place and manner of burial, 
the tort claim cannot be deemed duplicative of a claim of contract breach or dependent upon contract terms that remain 
undefined.""); Doherty v. Hertz Corp., Civil Action No. 10-cv-00359, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 124714, at *17-18 (D.N.J. Nov. 24, 
2010) (""At this stage, Doherty may plead alternative legal theories. If the rental agreement is later found void for lack of mutual 
assent or unconscionability, then Doherty may proceed with her unjust enrichment claim.""). "
949,25," In view of Plaintiffs' response to Defendant Siwell, the Court construes Plaintiffs' negligence claim as a claim for negligent 
misrepresentation. See section III.B.3."
949,26," Although Plaintiffs have not filed a motion to amend, the Court will construe the request in their Oppositions to the instant 
Motions to Dismiss as such a motion. See Coastal Air Transport, Inc. v. Pickering, Civil No. 2013-0089, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS

956,3," Although not ultimately relevant here, this is not the first suit that Nastasi filed in this Court based on these allegations. Nastasi 
filed an earlier suit alleging the same claims on December 31, 2018. See Nastasi & Assocs., Inc. v. Bloomberg, L.P., No. 18-CV-
12361 (JMF) (S.D.N.Y). The Court dismissed that suit for lack of Article III standing and pursuant to Rule 17 of the Federal Rules 
of Civil Procedure. See Nastasi & Assocs., Inc. v. Bloomberg, L.P., No. 18-CV-12361 (JMF), 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 42701, 2020 
WL 1166055 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 11, 2020). In light of an intervening change in the law, the Second Circuit vacated the Court's 
decision on standing and remanded for further proceedings. See Nastasi & Assocs., Inc. v. Bloomberg, L.P., 843 F. App'x 413 
(2d Cir. 2021) (summary order). On remand, the Court reaffirmed its alternative holding, dismissing pursuant to Rule 17. See 
Nastasi & Assocs., Inc. v. Bloomberg, L.P., No. 18-CV-12361 (JMF), 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 151101, 2021 WL 3541153 
(S.D.N.Y. Aug. 11, 2021). While the prior case was on appeal, Nastasi filed this suit and revived it after the Court's decision on 
remand. "
958,4," In light of the Court's conclusion that Nastasi adequately alleges fraudulent concealment, it need not and does not address 
Nastasi's other responses to Defendants' timeliness arguments. "
961,5," To the extent that other district courts have adopted a broader reading of Gatt that precludes a competitor from ever 
establishing antitrust injury on the basis of lost profits, see, e.g., Yong Ki Hong v. KBS Am., Inc., 951 F. Supp. 2d 402, 418 
(E.D.N.Y. 2013) (""In Gatt Communications, the court held that lost profits, though an economic injury, is simply not the type of 
injury that confers antitrust standing on a claimant.""), this Court takes a different view. "
962,6," Defendants do not challenge the third and fourth factors — until their reply brief, see Defs.' Reply 6-7, which is too late, see, 
e.g., [*34]  Farmer v. United States, No. 15-CV-6287 (ATM), 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 127275, 2017 WL 3448014, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. 
Aug. 10, 2017) (""Courts have repeatedly held that arguments raised for the first time in reply briefs are waived."" (collecting 
cases)). In any event, the Supreme Court has observed (albeit in the Lanham Act context) that these two factors are 
""'problematic' and that 'potential difficulty in ascertaining and apportioning damages is not . . . an independent basis for denying 
standing where it is adequately alleged that a defendant's conduct has proximately injured an interest of the plaintiff's that the 
statute protects.'"" DNAML, 25 F. Supp. 3d at 430 (quoting Lexmark Int'l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 
135, 134 S. Ct. 1377, 188 L. Ed. 2d 392 (2014)). Moreover, Nastasi's injury, as alleged, is not particularly speculative; nor does it 
raise the specter of duplicative or difficult-to-apportion damages. Nastasi alleges that, due to market manipulation, it lost 
approximately seven or eight specific contracts for which it was the lowest bidder. Compl.¶ 147; Pl.'s Opp'n 21. "
963,7," In light of that conclusion, the Court need not and does not address the parties' arguments with respect to the rule of reason. "
967,8," Contrary to Defendants' assertions, Nastasi's Complaint does allege that Eurotech was part of the 120 Park Project scheme. 
See Compl. ¶ 134 (alleging that Francisco ""requested and received cash and non-cash bribes from . . . Eurotech for work 
awarded at the 120 Park Project""); id ¶ 142 (""Turner instructed Eurotech to submit a losing bid for the drywall job at the 120 Park 
Project. Eurotech agreed because Turner steered the concrete work at that site to Eurotech.""). "
968,9," In their reply brief, Defendants assert that Nastasi's Complaint alleges that the RFPs were ""fraudulent themselves, and not 
merely used in furtherance of a larger scheme to defraud."" Defs.' Reply 17. But, some loose language aside, see, e.g., Compl. ¶ 
131 (""The false RFPs issued by Bloomberg . . . were part of a scheme to create the impression of a true and competitive bidding 
process.""), the Complaint does not actually allege that the requests themselves were fraudulent; instead, the alleged scheme 
involved fraudulent activity in the bidsetting process that occurred in response to the RFPs. See, e.g., Compl. ¶¶ 6-10; see also 
Pl.'s Opp'n 40-41 (""These RFPs were 'incident to an essential part of the scheme' as they helped create the façade of a fair and 
honest bidding process.""). "
969,10," Eurotech and Devlin argue that the allegations against them are ""blatantly untrue,"" citing ""documentary evidence"" that they 
submit in connection with their motion to dismiss. See Eurotech & Devlin Mem. 6-7; ECF No. 64. It is well established, however, 
that the Court is required to assume the truth of the well-pleaded allegations in the Complaint and may not consider evidence of 
the sort that Eurotech and Devlin submit. See, e.g., Paravas v. Cerf, No. 21-CV-7463 (RA) (BCM), 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12352,

984,1," The SCA entities, together, do business as ""SCA"" and hold themselves out as a single enterprise. (CAC ¶ 23, Dkt. No. 57.) 
Prior to March 2017, Surgical Care Affiliates, LLC was a direct operating subsidiary of Surgical Care Affiliates, Inc. (CAC ¶ 19.) 
In March 2017, Surgical Care Affiliates, Inc. merged with Defendant UHG and, since then, Surgical Care Affiliates, LLC has been 
a wholly-owned subsidiary of UHG (Id.) Similarly, the CAC alleges that SCA Holdings, LLC and SCAI Holdings, LLC are indirect 
wholly-owned subsidiaries of UHG, and are also successors in interest to Surgical Care Affiliates, Inc. (Id. ¶¶ 20-21.) The CAC 
names both SCA Holdings, LLC and SCAI Holdings, LLC as Defendants and includes both among the entities comprising 
""SCA."" (Id. ¶ 23.) However, Defendants note in their motion to dismiss that SCA Holdings, LLC is an unaffiliated third party that 
has not been served in the case. (Defs.' Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss at 1 n.1, Dkt. No. 76.) For present purposes, the Court 
uses ""SCA"" to refer to any alleged current or predecessor SCA entity."
984,2," Doe 1 refers to a coconspirator identified only as ""Company B"" in a criminal indictment brought against DaVita Defendants

985,4," The criminal case against DaVita Defendants proceeded to a jury trial, which resulted in the jury finding DaVita and Thiry not 
guilty on all counts. (DaVita, No. 21-cr-00229-RBJ (Apr. 15, 2022), ECF No. 262.) Subsequently, the district court entered

993,7," Because the challenged non-solicitation agreement in Aya was deemed to be ancillary, the Ninth Circuit declined to make a 
conclusive determination as to the applicable analysis. Aya, 9 F.4th at 1110 n.4."
993,8," The Sixth Circuit has held that a horizontal agreement between competitors not to solicit business from each other's existing

994,9," DaVita Defendants also seem to believe that Plaintiffs lack standing to bring a claim based on DaVita's agreement with Doe 1. 
Yet the CAC contains a single antitrust conspiracy claim; it does not allege a standalone claim based on DaVita's agreement 
with Doe 1. Thus, the fact that DaVita Defendants plausibly caused Plaintiffs an injury by entering into the conspiracy by way of 
DaVita's 2012 agreement with SCA ends the standing inquiry as to DaVita Defendants. "
995,10," Because SCA's merger with UHG is referenced in the CAC and central to Plaintiffs' claim against UHG, the merger agreement

1008,3," Traditionally, collateral estoppel also required ""mutuality,"" that is, that the parties in the prior action be the same as the parties 
in the action in which estoppel is being asserted. Peloro v. U.S., 488 F.3d 163, 175 (3d Cir. 2007). The doctrine has since shifted 
to allow ""non-mutual"" preclusion, where ""a litigant may also be estopped from advancing a position that he or she has presented 
and lost in a prior proceeding against a different adversary."" Id. Non-mutual collateral estoppel can be asserted either offensively, that is, by a plaintiff, or defensively, as it is here, by a 
defendant. For defensive collateral estoppel to apply, ""the party to be precluded must have had a 'full and fair' opportunity to 
litigate the issue in the first action."" Id. (citing Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, 439 U.S. 322, 328, 332, 99 S. Ct. 645, 58 L. Ed. 2d

1011,4," Tripas testified that he had not heard of ICP until Komatsu was ""notified about a potential lawsuit,"" from ICP, well after the 
relevant 2014 time period. (D.I. 397-21 at 38:17-39:8)."
1011,5," Because there is no evidence outside of Jeter's statements showing an agreement existed between Komatsu and IronPlanet, 
the coconspirator exclusion from hearsay, Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E), would not apply to Jeter's statements in ICP's case against 
Komatsu. United States v. Ammar, 714 F.2d 238, 245 (3d Cir. 1983) (for a coconspirator statement to be admitted under Rule 
802(d)(2)(E) ""there must be independent evidence establishing the existence of the conspiracy and connecting the declarant 
and defendant to it""). After Ammar, the Rule was amended in 1997: ""The statement must be considered but does not by itself 
establish . . . the existence of the conspiracy or participation in it."" In other words, if there is not some other evidence that 
Komatsu was a conspirator, it does not matter what Jeter said. I need not decide here whether the other hearsay exceptions ICP 
raises apply. (See D.I. 416 at 11-12)."
1011,6, There is also no evidentiary record to support any communications between anyone at Komatsu and Caterpillar or its dealers. 
1013,7," Caterpillar argues Frank's testimony regarding what Jeter told him over the phone is inadmissible hearsay. I disagree. Under 
Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E), Frank's testimony would not qualify as hearsay, because IronPlanet became a coconspirator (within 
the meaning of the Rule) with Caterpillar at the time it removed ICP's hosted store from its website. The record shows this 
happened the day before Frank and Jeter's phone conversation. (D.I. 419-65). "
1017,8," At the motion to dismiss stage, I analyzed ICP's tortious interference claim under Florida and Illinois law. (D.I. 292 at 3). In their 
summary judgment briefing, none of the parties have reargued the choice of law issue, so I will continue to apply the laws of 
Florida and Illinois. ICP argued in its motion to dismiss briefing that its tortious interference claim should be governed by Florida 
or Illinois law, as what is at the center of ICP's tortious interference claim is ""a conspiracy in which substantial misconduct 
occurred in Florida [where Ring Power and Thompson, Caterpillar's alleged coconspirators, reside] and Illinois [where Caterpillar 
resides]."" (D.I. 276 at 6). "
1019,9," The Court wrote under an earlier version of Rule 702, but the subsequent amendments to it were not intended to make any 
substantive change. "
1023,1," The Ukrainian judgments are available on the Ukrainian government's official online registry of court decisions 
(https://reyestr.court.gov.ua/). See [ECF No. 163]. "
1024,2," The United States has advised that it plans to renew its motion to stay this case under 18 U.S.C. § 981(g)(1) if the Court denies 
the motion to dismiss or abstain. The stated reason [ECF No. 161, p. 9] for the possible stay motion foreshadowed by the United 
States is to avoid having this civil lawsuit affect an ongoing criminal investigation. In a May 13, 2021 Order, the Court denied 
[ECF No. 75] the United States' earlier-filed motion to stay [ECF No. 46]. That part of the ruling, which was part of a two-page 
Omnibus Order addressing five matters, was succinct. "
1026,3," The outstanding mortgage on the property, which was $65,700,000, was assumed, and a total of $16,651,167.17, ($3.5 million, 
plus $13,151,167.17), was expended for the purchase. See [ECF No. 1 at ¶¶ 104-06]. "
1027,4," Technically, the real estate itself is not the named defendant. But, as explained in greater detail later in this Report and 
Recommendations, the real estate is in fact exactly what was actually sold in the sale in which the United States was involved. "
1028,5," The United States filed Chernykh's Declaration in the Delaware Chancery Court, not in the instant forfeiture case pending in the 
Southern District of Florida."
1028,6," The United States challenges the authenticity of many Claimant-submitted exhibits and says it has ""identified a series of 
material omissions and errors in the English translation of the Kyiv Economic Court's opinion"" which ""raise serious doubts about 
the reliability of that copy of the decision or, at a minimum, the translation of it."" [ECF No. 148, p. 3]. "
1029,7," Rule 44.1, entitled ""Determining Foreign Law,"" provides that a court ""may consider any relevant material or source, including 
testimony, whether or not submitted by a party or admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence,"" when determining foreign 
law. "
1030,8," ""Considering"" a source does not necessarily mean that I deem it to be persuasive or meritorious. Instead, it simply means that 
the source will be evaluated for whatever weight is appropriate, which may well be none. "
1031,9," The Ungaro-Benages Court identified four factors: the competency of the foreign court, whether the foreign judgment was 
obtained by fraud, whether the ""central issue in dispute is a matter of foreign law,"" and ""whether there is a prospect of conflicting 
judgments."" 379 F.3d at 1238. "
1032,10," As we will see shortly, the involvement of the United States as a plaintiff here is of huge significance. In fact, Claimants have 
been unable to find any legal authority where a case was dismissed (or a district court abstained on comity grounds) when the 
United States was a party plaintiff."
1032,11," In its Court-required memorandum [ECF No. 152, p. 4, n.1], the United States contends that an ""unusually rigorous abuse-of-
discretion standard"" applies if a court abstains based on comity. But the United States does not cite to any Eleventh Circuit law 
to support this argument. Instead, it cites a Second Circuit opinion: In re Picard, Tr. for Liquidation of Bernard L. Madoff Inv. Sec. 
LLC, 917 F.3d 85, 101 n.7 (2d Cir. 2019). It also cites Royal & Sun, 466 F.3d at 92 (""[B]ecause we are reviewing a court's 
decision to abstain from exercising jurisdiction, our review is 'more rigorous' than that which is generally employed under the 
abuse-of-discretion standard. 'In review of decisions to abstain, there is little practical distinction between review for abuse of 
discretion and review de novo.'"" (citing Hachamovitch v. DeBuono, 159 F.3d 687, 693 (2d Cir. 1998))). The Undersigned sees no reason to ignore the Eleventh Circuit's standard of review articulated in In Re Neves and Daewoo 
Motor. If the United States had law from our Eleventh Circuit to support its theory that the standard of review is ""unusually 
rigorous,"" then, the Undersigned assumes, it would have cited it. "
1035,12," Nevertheless, Claimants are still correct when they say that (1) the United States must, in order to prevail in this civil forfeiture 
lawsuit, establish that Ukrainian companies violated Ukrainian law when they obtained loans from a Ukrainian bank; (2) the 
Ukrainian borrowers accused by the United States of violating Ukrainian law filed lawsuits in Ukrainian courts against the 
Ukrainian bank from which they allegedly stole funds by fraud; (3) the Ukrainian borrowers sought judgments that the allegations 
are false (and that the loans at issue were not fraudulent); (4) the Ukrainian courts ruled in favor of the borrowers, finding the 
loans valid; and (5) the Ukrainian judgments (now on appeal) were based on much of the evidence which will be at issue in the 
instant lawsuit. "
1037,13," The Ukrainian decisions which Claimants rely on are on appeal. This weakens Claimants' argument. See Turner Ent., 25 F.3d 
at 1523 (declining to dismiss pending foreign appeal); Posner v. Essex Ins. Co., 178 F.3d 1209, 1224 (11th Cir. 1999) (same). The parties had not expressly addressed the reality that Ukraine is currently in a months-long war with Russia, which generates 
the possibility that resolution of the appeal will be delayed, perhaps even for a significant amount of time, or that the taking of 
evidence in Ukraine might be delayed, as well. In response to a question flagged by the Undersigned, the United States posited [ECF No. 161, p. 9] that it would be 
inappropriate for it (or Claimants) to speculate on these potential war-influenced consequences. In response [ECF No. 162, p. 5, 
n.5] to the same Court-initiated discussion, Claimants say the war ""will clearly hinder the parties' ability to gather evidence and 
witnesses from Ukraine"" but conclude that ""the war has not made the Ukrainian courts an inconvenient forum."" According to 
Claimants, the trial and appellate courts of Ukraine ""continue to function"" and Claimants say they do not believe the war has any 
impact on the comity analysis. Given Claimants' position that the war should not be part of the comity analysis and the United States' position that discussion of 
the war's impact would be inappropriate speculation, the Undersigned will not factor the war into the comity inquiry."
1037,14,"  [C]ourts have sought to fashion principles that will promote three readily identifiable goals in the area of concurrent 
international jurisdiction: (1) a proper level of respect for the acts of our fellow sovereign nations—a rather vague concept 
referred to in American jurisprudence as international comity; (2) fairness to litigants; and (3) efficient use of scarce judicial 
resources. Turner Ent., 25 F.3d at 1518; see also Med-X Global, LLC v. SunMed Int'l, LLC, No. 19-20722, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 133099, 
2019 WL 3752619, at *2 (S.D. Fla. Aug. 8, 2019) (citing the three topics as factors used in determining whether a Court should 
exercise its discretion and abstain from a case pending the conclusion of parallel international litigation). "
1038,15," Claimants rely on the declaration of Dmytro Marchukov, [ECF No. 78-8], to provide legal support for their arguments about 
obtaining evidence from Ukrainian witnesses and similar topics. His declaration (which also discusses other topics) describes 
him as a Partner and Head of Cross-Border Litigation at Integrites law firm in Kyiv. Marchukov's declaration explains that he is 
fluent in English and that the bulk of his practice is conducted in English. It also notes that Russian is his native language and 
that he is also fluent in Ukrainian. "
1041,16, The Court there ultimately granted dismissal on forum non conveniens grounds. 
1043,17," The Court in that in rem forfeiture action against a $38.5 million jet began its international comity analysis by noting that the 
doctrine has ""no single definition,"" as it ""summarizes in a brief word a complex and elusive concept."" Id. at 8 (citing Nippon 
Paper Indus., 109 F.3d at 8 (""[C]omity is more an aspiration than a fixed rule, more a matter of grace than a matter of 
obligation."")). The Court rejected international comity as grounds for dismissal, noting that ""the executive 'has already done the 
balancing in deciding to bring the case in the first place.'"" (emphasis added) (quoting United States v. Brodie, 174 F. Supp. 2d 
294, 306 (E.D. Pa. 2001)). "
1046,18," In that case, the United States sought to forfeit a one-sixth right to lottery payments acquired by the gang leader Whitey Bulger 
when he purchased a share of a lottery ""season ticket"" that won a $14 million jackpot and entitled him to annual installment 
payments for twenty years. The First Circuit analogized the interest in the lottery ticket to shares of stock in a company, finding 
that there was ""no meaningful difference"" between the two. Id. at 44-45. The court concluded that it could exercise jurisdiction 
over an ""intangible res,"" including ""the right to receive future dividends."" Id. "
1048,19," One of the invoices submitted was from the Black Srebnick firm, counsel to the Claimants in this in rem civil forfeiture case. 
[ECF No. 155-4, p. 2 of 9]."
1048,20," The Undersigned's Post-Hearing Administrative Order did not specify that the closing statement itself must be filed. It did, 
however, require the United States to file ""copies of all communications between the United States and the interlocutory sale 
purchaser, including communications with the purchaser's attorney or agent, concerning the specific description of the property 
being sold in the interlocutory sale and the nature of the property interest being conveyed."" [ECF No. 143, pp. 3-4 (emphasis 
added)]. "
1049,21," Shaffer v. Heitner, 433 U.S. 186, 97 S. Ct. 2569, 53 L. Ed. 2d 683 (1977). "
1050,22," Subsection (d) provides: ""The entry of a charging order is the exclusive remedy by which a judgment creditor of a member or a 
member's assignee may satisfy a judgment out of the judgment debtor's limited liability company interest and attachment, 
garnishment, foreclosure or other legal or equitable remedies are not available to the judgment creditor, whether the limited 
liability company has 1 member or more than 1 member."" Subsection (e) provides: ""No creditor of a member or of a member's assignee shall have any right to obtain possession of, or 
otherwise exercise legal or equitable remedies with respect to, the property of the limited liability company."" "
1051,23," Where a court determines that a forfeiture complaint is inadequate in some respect, ""it should . . . dismiss[] the complaint with 
leave to amend."" United States v. Four Parcels of Real Prop. in Greene & Tuscaloosa Ctys. in State of Ala., 941 F.2d 1428, 
1442 (11th Cir. 1991); see also United States v. Certain Accts., Together With all Monies on Deposit Therein, 795 F. Supp. 391, 
399 (S.D. Fla. 1992) (dismissing claims but granting the Government leave to amend). "
1052,24," Claimants assert another purported pleadings defect with the Verified Complaint: they say it also fails to plead a substantial 
connection between the alleged loans issued in Ukraine in 2010 and 2011 and the rights and interests of Optima CBD 
Investments LLC and CBD 500 LLC in PNC Corporate Plaza Holdings LLC. They highlight that neither Optima CBD Investments 
LLC, CBD 500 LLC, nor PNC Corporate Plaza Holdings LLC even existed in 2011. In addition, the funds used by Optima CBD 
Investments LLC, CBD 500 LLC, and PNC Corporate Plaza Holdings LLC to purchase PNC Plaza out of foreclosure came from 
separate money, i.e., from Felman. Claimants proclaim that none of the money provided by Felman is alleged to be traceable to 
the 2010 and 2011 loans. Therefore, Claimants posit, the failure to connect or trace Optima CBD Investments LLC, CBD 500 LLC, and PNC Corporate 
Plaza Holdings LLC back to the alleged specified unlawful 2010 and 2011 loans in Ukraine fails to meet the requirement of ""a 
substantial connection between the property and the offense,"" let alone of ""stating sufficiently detailed facts to support a 
reasonable belief that the [G]overnment will be able to meet its burden of proof at trial."" Supplemental Rule G(2). "
1054,25," In addition, section 984(b) is completely inapplicable, as it is concerned exclusively with fungible, untraceable assets. When 
the Government seeks to forfeit ""cash, monetary instruments in bearer forms, funds deposited in a financial institution . . ., or 
precious metals,"" 18 U.S.C. § 984(a)(1), and such property is ""not traceable directly to the offense that is the basis for the 
forfeiture,"" the forfeiture action must be commenced within one year from the date of the offense, 18 U.S.C. § 984(b). This action, though, does not seek fungible property such as bulk cash or loose diamonds. Instead, it seeks interests in 
corporate entities that owned an office building in Kentucky purchased with funds misappropriated from PrivatBank. The Verified 
Complaint details the transfers of fraudulently obtained loans from PrivatBank and their transfer to Claimants. See, e.g., [ECF 
No. 1, §§ 125-131]. "
1056,1," This background regarding Genesys's claims is taken from the Third Amended Complaint and is provided to give context to the 
Daubert motions. These are not findings by the court and are merely allegations Genesys intends to prove at trial."
1056,2," Genesys also asserted claims against former Genesys employee Danielle Morales, but Genesys and Morales stipulated to 
dismissal of these claims on May 14, 2021. (Dkt. 245.)"
1056,3," Genesys filed its Amended Motion for Preliminary Injunction (Dkt. 164) on November 8, 2019, seeking to prohibit defendants 
from misappropriating its trade secrets, to prohibit defendants from interfering with employee contracts, to prohibit defendants 
from soliciting customers, and to obtain an order for the inventory and return of all Genesys property. The court denied this 
motion on December 6, 2019. (Dkt. 199.)"
1056,4," On February 24, 2022, the court granted in part and denied in part the parties' cross motions for summary judgment. (Dkt. 351.) 
The court ruled that the following claims may proceed to trial: (1) breach of contract based on the confidentiality provision 
against Manno and Strahan; (2) misappropriation of trade secrets against defendants; (3) aiding and abetting a breach of the 
fiduciary duty of loyalty against defendants; (4) civil conspiracy against defendants; (5) tortious interference with contract against 
Manno and Talkdesk; and (6) raiding against Talkdesk. (Id.) Defendants filed a motion for reconsideration (Dkt. 365), but the 
court denied that motion on April 21, 2022. (Dkt. 380.) "
1057,5," Except where the court distinguishes among them, it will hereafter use ""Talkdesk"" both when referring to the company 
individually and when referring to the defendants collectively. "
1058,6," The court does not address here the admissibility of any fact testimony Alamgir may offer. In its reply brief (Dkt. 331 at 1), 
Genesys states ""[t]o the extent that Defendants want to have him testify as a fact witness, the relevancy of such testimony from 
an individual not even employed by Talkdesk during the raid can be determined during trial."" The court agrees that the relevance 
of any fact testimony Alamgir offers must be determined at trial. But defendants' proffer of his testimony as opinion—not based 
on his personal knowledge of the events at issue in this case—requires the court to apply Daubert principles to his testimony to 
the extent it falls within the scope of Fed. R. Evid. 702."
1058,7," Genesys also points out that Alamgir has never served as an expert witness in any other matter. Serving as an expert in a 
previous matter might bolster a witness's qualifications, but the court cannot conclude that an expert is any less qualified 
because he has not previously testified as an expert. See U.S. v. Parra, 402 F.3d 752, 758-59 (7th Cir. 2005) (holding that ""there 
is a first time in court for every witness: the question is not whether Agent Becka was a professional witness; it is whether he 
was an expert on the topic . . .""). The question for the court is not whether Alamgir has testified as an expert witness before, but 
rather, whether he is an expert on the topic of lead generation. "
1059,8," As a non-retained expert, Alamgir was not required to provide a Rule 26(a)(2)(B) expert report. Instead, defendants disclosed a 
summary of the facts and opinions on which Alamgir is expected to testify as required by Rule 26(a)(2)(C)."
1059,9," Genesys claims that Alamgir has not set forth a scientifically reliable methodology. However, Alamgir is expected to offer 
nonscientific, technical expert testimony about the contact center industry. ""When [expert] testimony is not based on science, but 
rather on technical and other specialized knowledge, this Court may consider one or more of the more specific factors that 
Daubert mentioned when doing so will help determine that testimony's reliability, but the test of reliability is flexible, and 
Daubert's list of specific factors neither necessarily nor exclusively applies to all experts or in every case."" Pulse Engineering, 
Inc. v. Travelers Indem. Co., 2009 WL 6361497, at *2 (S.D. Ind. Sep. 22, 2009) (citing Kumho, 526 U.S. at 141) (internal 
citations omitted). "
1060,10," Talkdesk's link to DataFox tends to support the assertion that companies across various industries utilize lead generation 
software. (Dkt. 328 at 6, https://www.oracle.com/cx/datafox/.) "
1062,11," Genesys claims that Minnucci has not set forth a scientifically reliable methodology. However, Minnucci is expected to offer 
nonscientific, technical expert testimony about the contact center industry. See supra note 9. "
1069,12," The court notes that, in its reply brief, Genesys claims that there is ""sworn testimony from Talkdesk's own Vice President, 
Mervyn Alamgir, that the lists are not comparable [See Dkt. 266 at 12]."" (Dkt. 330 at 5-6.) Genesys's citation in support of this 
assertion, however, is to Genesys's summary judgment brief—not to any evidence of testimony from Alamgir or any other 
person for that matter."
1069,13," Genesys claims that ""Maness' opinion on Talkdesk's maximum willingness to pay simply reiterates Defendants['] factual 
arguments on the merits. For example, Maness gives his unqualified opinion as to why he thinks the 'contract effective date' is 
not helpful (a merits argument)."" Genesys does not explain why Maness opining on matters that defendants have also 
addressed is significant and/or warrants exclusion. Further, whether contract effective dates would be valuable to Talkdesk goes 
to the value of the PureCloud list. Maness has been retained to opine on reasonable royalty damages, which requires him to 
opine about the value of the PureCloud list. His opinion does not warrant exclusion because he comes to a conclusion with 
which Genesys does not agree. "
1070,14," Arguments about what the 6sense database contains and whether that information is comparable to information contained in 
the PureCloud list concern factual matters suited for cross-examination and other witnesses. Genesys can also cross-examine 
Maness about his reliance on Alamgir's declaration that 6sense is ""Talkdesk's most expensive database"" and that ""the value 
generated by 6sense is also ... higher than that which is available in the Genesys Customer List."" (Dkt. 314-1 at ¶84.)"
1070,15," ""Marketing Qualified Leads (""MQLs"") represent potential customers with a demonstrated interest in the CCaaSS provider's 
platform, along with key businesses and contact information. MQLs include the customer's contact information, the number of 
employees, location, and industry, among other things. I understand that MQLs also contain an 'intensity' score which signals 
the level of interest from the prospective customer."" (Dkt. 314-1 at n. 45.) "
1079,1," The Court draws much of this background from the allegations in APL's Amended Complaint, which the Court must accept as 
true at this stage of the case. Matson no doubt disputes many of the allegations. "
1083,2," As the Court reads the complaint, APL describes the U.S.-Guam market as the only market where it is foreclosed from 
competition by Matson's conduct for purposes of its monopolization and attempted monopolization claims. By contrast, the 
complaint appears to define the U.S.-Hawai'i market (in which APL cannot compete for other reasons) only to contextualize its 
allegations that Matson leverages its power in that market to coerce customers in the U.S.-Guam market. "
1084,3," The Court analyzes APL's monopoly-power and anticompetitive-conduct allegations in the context of the broadest alleged 
market: container shipping from the U.S to Guam. Because the complaint sufficiently alleges anticompetitive conduct in that 
broadest market, the Court will wait to assess the validity and relevance of APL's narrower markets until further development of 
the factual record. "
1085,4," Matson correctly observes that APL's references to a ""contestable"" submarket—a market comprised of only the geographic and 
product submarkets in which APL actively competes—creates confusion as to which defined market the Court should analyze for 
market power and anticompetitive effects (or whether such a market is properly defined). Am. Compl. ¶¶ 51 n.6. But again, 
because the Court sustains APL's claims as to the broadest market of container shipping between US-Guam, any contentions 
regarding this purported submarket do not doom the amended complaint."
1085,5," Many courts have referenced the Ninth Circuit's detailed discussion of barriers to entry in Rebel Oil, including the D.C. Circuit in 
Microsoft. 253 F.3d at 51. "
1086,6," The other case Matson relies on, Ball Mem'l Hosp., Inc. v. Mut. Hosp. Ins., Inc., is similarly unconvincing. There, the Seventh 
Circuit affirmed the trial court's denial of a request for a preliminary injunction after finding that the defendant did not have power 
in a market of over 1,000 potential participants with ""no barriers to entry"" for ""a fungible product that other people can and do 
supply easily."" 784 F.2d 1325, 1331-32 (7th Cir. 1986) (analyzing the market for health care financing). Moreover, that holding 
was reached after a hearing that lasted eleven days in which more than 30 witnesses testified and over 400 exhibits were 
introduced. Id. at 1331. Thus, this case does not support Matson's contention that the complaint must be dismissed before 
discovery because Matson disputes whether APL is impeded from expanding in some segments of the relevant market. "
1087,7," The Court assumes that APL will be able to provide more details supporting its allegations of threatening conduct during 
discovery. "
1088,8," APL attributes its ""40% to 50% or more"" foreclosure figure to more conduct than just Matson's loyalty program. Am. Compl. ¶ 
51 (listing ""Matson's loyalty program, exclusive dealing, bundled pricing, and tying scheme"" as the cause of its foreclosure). This 
is not an issue, however, given that APL does not allege that each action is an independent antitrust violation. It instead 
describes Matson's activities collectively to support its monopolization and attempted monopolization claims. The D.C. Circuit 
has not ruled on the validity of such ""course of conduct"" analysis, but other courts have found it possible to consider a series of 
separate acts that independently have anticompetitive effect. See Microsoft, 253 F.3d at 78 (noting course of conduct theory 
without passing on its validity); LePage's Inc. v. 3M, 324 F.3d 141, 162 (3d. Cir. 2003) (""The relevant inquiry is the 
anticompetitive effect of 3M's exclusionary practices considered together.""); New York v. Facebook, Inc., 549 F. Supp. 3d 6, 28 
(D.D.C. 2021) (""To be clear, it is possible that were a monopolist to embark on a concerted scheme of serial refusals to deal with 
rivals, that scheme or 'course of conduct' could amount to a separate and independent violation of the Sherman Act.""). 
Accordingly, the Court will assess the validity of the alleged foreclosure without attempting to attribute specific percentages to 
each alleged activity."
1088,9," For one, APL uses inconsistent markets to define monopoly power and anticompetitive effects. Compare Am. Compl. ¶ 67 
(""Matson continues to have substantial monopoly power in container cargo shipping services between the United States and 
Guam. Matson's share of these markets still exceeds 70% of such overall container shipment volume."") with Am. Compl. ¶ 51 
(""APL is excluded from competing for at least 40% to 50% or more of the 'contestable' container cargo shipping services in the 
U.S./Guam markets[.]"")."
1088,10," APL alleges it was foreclosed from more than 50% of the ""contestable"" market, which represents 70% of the total market, 
meaning it was foreclosed from 35% or more of the total market. Am. Compl. ¶ 51 n.6. "
1089,11," APL also claims that Surescripts was a bundled products case, but this is incorrect. Pls.' Opp'n at 29. While Surescripts did 
offer discounts in two separate but complementary markets, the discounts were independent. Surescripts, 424 F. Supp. 3d at 95."
1089,12," Because the Court permits discovery on both the U.S.-Hawai'i and U.S.-Guam loyalty programs, the Court need not rule on 
APL's tying or monopoly leveraging claims arising from the same facts."
1089,13," HN14[
] APL does not claim that Matson's lobbying activities fall under the ""mere sham"" exception to Noerr-Pennington. See E. R.R. Presidents Conf., 365 U.S. at 144 (noting that application of the Sherman Act is justified where advocacy is a ""mere 
sham"" to cover an ""attempt to interfere directly with the business relationships of a competitor"")."
1089,14," The complaint does not explain what ""rates"" APL is referring to, or the basis for its comparison to other rates. "
1097,1," MBFS filed a Request for Judicial Notice [], (Dkt. 22, ""RJN""), attaching an excerpt of Daimler AG's 2020 Annual Report listing 
Daimler AG's subsidiaries. (See Dkt. 22, Exh. 1, at 247-248) (showing that Daimler AG holds a 100% equity interest in both

F.3d 1148, 1160 (9th Cir. 2001). "
1098,3," The court is not convinced by plaintiff's reliance on In re Ray Dobbins Lincoln-Mercury, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co. (""Ray Dobbins""), 
604 F.Supp.203 (W.D. Va.1984). As the court in Bell Atlantic noted, ""the Fourth Circuit subsequently disapproved th[e Ray

Advanced Health-Care Servs., Inc., 910 F.2d at 145. For the same reason, the court is unpersuaded by various other cases

1098,4," (See, e.g., Dkt. 20, FAC at ¶¶ 3,4, 7, 8, 46) (""Defendants have conspired in an attempt to eliminate the competition faced by 
Mercedes franchise dealerships with regard to the purchase and sale of used Mercedes vehicles""; ""Defendants have placed 
these artificial and anticompetitive restrictions on the used vehicle market for Mercedes vehicles in order to ensure that 
Defendants, and their franchise dealerships, maintain dominance over the entire market for used Mercedes vehicles""; "

1099,5," Even if other companies — due to the ""unprecedented demand for vehicles[,]"" (Dkt. 20, FAC at ¶ 25) - were to adopt 
defendants' leasing practices to try to restrict non-franchise dealer trade-ins, the antitrust laws would not prohibit such parallel 
conduct by independently motivated, profit-seeking firms. See Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556-57, 127 S.Ct. at 1966 (""[A]n allegation 
of parallel conduct and a bare assertion of conspiracy will not suffice. Without more, parallel conduct does not suggest

illegality.""); In re Musical Instruments & Equip. Antitrust Litig., 798 F.3d 1186, 1193 (9th Cir. 2015) (""Under Twombly, parallel 
conduct, such as competitors adopting similar policies around the same time in response to similar market conditions, may

1100,6, Counsel may agree to meet and confer at another time without seeking court approval for such an agreement.

1111,2," The Court assumes the parties' familiarity with the general background facts as described in its prior order on defendants' 
motion to dismiss plaintiffs' second amended complaint (Dkt. No. 65 at 2-6) and does not repeat those facts in this order. "
1112,3," Plaintiffs withdrew their Lanham Act claim to the extent it was based on false association. They also appeared to abandon 
allegations that defendants violate the Lanham Act by describing YouTube as a viewpoint-neutral community that values 
freedom of expression. See Dkt. No. 65 at 12-13; see also Dkt. No. 25 at 17-18; Dkt. No. 36 at 24-27; Dkt. No. 62 at 29:9-13. "

defendants' alleged ""promotion of their service as a neutral public forum"" (see, e.g., Dkt. No. 67 ¶¶ 344, 350, 351, 355), as "
1114,," discussed above, plaintiffs were given leave to amend their Lanham Act claim only to the extent it was based on false 
advertising. See Dkt. No. 65 at 19."
1114,5," Defendants move to strike the declaratory judgment claim on the ground that plaintiffs were not clearly given leave to reassert 
or amend that claim. See Dkt. No. 77 at 1, 9 n.9. To the extent that the Court's order on defendants' prior motion to dismiss may 
be ambiguous as to whether plaintiffs were permitted to reassert or amend this claim, defendants' motion to strike is denied. "

1120,8," Plaintiffs apparently intended to, but did not, append the transcript to the TAC. See Dkt. No. 67 ¶ 20 n.6. Nevertheless, both 
sides invite the Court to review the transcript appended to plaintiffs' prior pleadings, most recently submitted as Exhibit A to 
plaintiffs' SAC. See Dkt. No. 20 at ECF 130-135; Dkt. No. 85 at 18; Dkt. No. 88 at 7. "
1121,9," Plaintiffs suggest that defendants' invocation of CDA Section 230 as a defense is also ""unfair"" conduct (see Dkt. No. 85 at 19 
(citing Dkt. No. 65 ¶ 5). The Court addresses the CDA Section 230 defense below. "
1124,10," Accordingly, consideration of those materials under the incorporation-by-reference doctrine is inappropriate. See Khoja, 899 
F.3d at 1005 (concluding that the incorporation-by-reference doctrine did not apply to a document not clearly referenced or 
quoted in the complaint). HN19[
] As explained by the Ninth Circuit, ""[w]hen parties pile on volumes of exhibits to their motion 
to dismiss, hoping to squeeze some into the complaint, their submissions can become needlessly unwieldy. . . . [and] materials 
may be inserted into pleadings when they should not be there."" Id. For much the same reasons, the Court does not find it 
appropriate to take judicial notice of the contents of the parties' submitted documents. See id. at 999 (stating that judicial notice 
is reserved for facts that are ""'not subject to reasonable dispute,' are 'generally known,' or 'can be accurately and readily 
determined from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.'"") (quoting Fed. R. Evid. 201(b)(1)-(2))."
1124,11," While acknowledging the possibility that an implied covenant claim may fall within an exception to CDA Section 230 immunity, 
defendants maintain that not all contract-based claims necessarily survive CDA immunity. See Dkt. No. 88 at 16; see also 
Murphy, 60 Cal. App. 5th at 29-35 (concluding that CDA Section 230(c)(1) barred plaintiff's contract claim, which was based, not 
on the breach of a specific promise, but on defendant's enforcement of its own policies). The Court, however, is not persuaded 
that, as a matter of law, CDA Section 230 necessarily immunizes a defendant from liability for contract claims. In any event, 
because the TAC fails to state a plausible claim based on the implied covenant, the Court reserves judgment as to whether any 
such claim may be barred by CDA Section 230. "
1129,12," The parties dispute whether defendants should be permitted to file a statement of recent decision concerning Judge Chen's 
order on a motion to dismiss in Huber v. Biden, No. 21-cv-06580-EMC, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 48660 , 2022 WL 827248 (N.D. 
Cal. Mar. 18, 2022). See Dkt. Nos. 102, 103. In briefing the matter, both sides present substantive arguments regarding their 
respective views on the relevance of Huber. As the parties have had an opportunity to brief the matter, the Court grants 
defendants' request for leave to file their statement of recent decision. The Court otherwise finds it unnecessary to rely on Huber; 
as discussed above, plaintiffs have not persuasively argued that Denver Area requires either a finding of state action or a 
constitutional violation in the present matter. "

1134,3," The Court declines to rule on the admissibility of the expert opinions contained in the McCullough and Lipow reports as moot. 
Where there is no dispute, however, the Court has referenced these reports as sources of background information about the gas

California gas production at various points during the class period. See, e.g., id. (noting that non-Defendant PBF accounted for 
12% of production and non-Defendant Marathon accounted for up to 30% of production)."

each other out volumetrically without adverse financial impact."" Pltfs. Ex. 139. This statement, made in the context of a price 
negotiation to settle remaining balances, captures the mutually beneficial essence of exchange agreements. See id."
1147,14," In Exhibit 147, Shell requested product from Phillips 66 under an exchange agreement and Phillips 66 agreed to supply up to 
a certain amount and be paid back five days later. Plaintiffs highlight that Shell received product on a day when gas prices were 
$1.79/gallon and ultimately returned product to Phillips 66 five days later when gas prices were $1.72/gallon. See Pltfs. Exs. 
148-49. Plaintiffs ignore the fact that Defendants entered into an agreement not knowing what the price would be five days later.

1151,23," In their opposition, Plaintiffs claim that Tesoro also wrote that the information was ""confirmed via several sources including the

1158,38," BP also submitted evidence that its alleged reroute in January 2016 was in fact a complex transaction with Valero that 
benefitted BP. See Joint MSJ at 32; H. Henderlite Declaration ¶¶ 24-27; J.A. 915-916, BP Ex. 6. Valero had a cargo shipping 
from the United Kingdom to its Bay Area refinery but realized that it could not get its cargo into its harbor because the cargo was 
too heavy to get through the ""Pinole Shoals,"" a channel that had to be crossed to reach Valero's Bay Area refinery. See id. At 
the same time, BP had its own cargo coming to its Los Angeles refinery but realized that the cargo was unlikely to arrive in time 
to be used there because it was stuck in the Pacific Northwest due to weather. See id. Thus, BP sold its cargo to Valero since it 
was not going to reach BP's Los Angeles refinery in time and because BP was already at storage capacity at its Bay Area 
refinery and could not use the gas there. See id. BP also purchased Valero's shipment coming from the United Kingdom. See id. 
BP ultimately determined that selling Valero's cargo into New York was more profitable than bringing it to the West Coast—at 
that time, Valero's shipment was near Jamaica and thus was ""over 1,000 nautical miles closer to the East Coast"" than to the 
West Coast, and East Coast prices at that time were better than what West Coast prices were predicted to be by the time 
Valero's cargo would have arrived at one of BP's West Coast refineries. See id."
1158,39," Defendants concede on summary judgment that BP rerouted a cargo in January 2016 as described above, see supra note 38, 
and thus, the existence of this reroute is not disputed. In opposing summary judgment, Plaintiffs point to Defendants' admission 
that the reroute occurred but do not point to evidence in response to Defendants' Step One explanation; instead, Plaintiffs "

605, Ex. C (""Ordover Report"") ¶ 317; Dkt. 617, J. Ordover Declaration ¶ 7 & Fig. 1. The Court does not credit Dr. Ordover's 
opinion or analysis over Dr. Williams'. Rather, Dr. Ordover's findings merely counsel against overlooking the fundamental 
unreliability of Dr. Williams' methodology based on an untested assumption. "
1172,55," Plaintiffs themselves have made conflicting arguments regarding whether Dr. Hanouna is being offered on the issue of 
causation. On opposition to summary judgment, Plaintiffs point to Dr. Hanouna's opinions as evidence of causation. Opposition 
at 55-56. Then, at oral argument, Plaintiffs stated that his opinion was being offered solely on the issue of damages and was not 
being offered to show causation. See Dkt. 809 at 32 (stating that the ""experts aren't doing a causation analysis.""). "
1173,56," Given the Court's ruling, it does not consider whether Dr. Williams' and Dr. Hanouna's expert opinions are admissible on the 
issue of damages. "
1174,57," Given the Court's rulings in this order, it does not consider whether Mr. McCullough's expert opinion is admissible on the issue 
of liability."
1174,58," Were a jury to attempt to infer causation from the trader exchanges between BP and Phillips 66, they would necessarily have 
to devolve into speculation. Plaintiffs would have a jury infer that these traders did in fact enter trades based on the information 
exchanged and that those trades were then reported to OPIS absent any evidence of same. This chain of inferences is 
especially tenuous given that OPIS reports an average price taken from the high and low trades in its survey. See Opposition at 
47; J.A. 562-76, Phillips Ex. 17 (OPIS pricing methodology). Accordingly, a juror would also have to infer that the trades 
executed and reported were the high or low trade at the time OPIS averaged the price information. There is no evidence in the "
1175,," record of any of the foregoing, and a juror would have no evidence from which to determine that these exchanges had any 
impact on spot-market prices. "
1178,1," The Court may resolve this motion even though not all parties have been served yet. See Rivers v. Union Pac. R.R., 2017 U.S.

1198,2," The Court entered an opinion and order on November 30, 2021 awarding fees and costs to counsel for the Direct Purchaser 
Class resulting from a group of settlements. See R. 5225. Because the relevant legal issues are the same here, and the Court's 
analysis of those issues has not changed, the Court could simply incorporate by reference the prior opinion. Instead, this opinion 
largely tracks that opinion to provide a self-contained record of the Court's decision on this motion."

money is $2,000 multiplied by 25, or $50,000."
1199,4," Professor Fitzpatrick also filed a declaration in support of the Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs' class counsel's motion for fees. See R.

summary judgment and trial. (Letter Regarding Status Update dated May 26, 2020, Docket Entry No. 7949.) In their supporting 
memorandum Defendants state that ""[a]s usual, the '7-Eleven Plaintiffs' includes the Elgin Plaintiff' because Elgin's complaint is 
parallel to the 7-Eleven Plaintiffs' complaint and Elgin intends to rely on the 7-Eleven Plaintiffs' experts. (Defs.' Mem. 1 n.1.) Plaintiffs also contest any implication that before the liability shift, ""issuers were always or 'generally' liable for fraud perpetrated 
on card-present transactions."" (DAPs' 56.1 Response ¶ 1117.) They argue that Visa and Mastercard have ""maintained network 
rules that substantially reduced issuer liability for fraud on their cards when used in person"" even before the liability shift. (Id.) 
For purposes of this motion, the Court makes 110 findings about how often issuers were liable for fraud before the liability shift."
1258,6," In June of 2022, the Judicial Conference Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure voted to approve two amendments to

(Sept. 
5, 
2022), 
https://businesslawtoday.org/2022/09/rule-702-amendment-process-progression-potential-

reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the case"" to ""the expert's opinion reflects a reliable application of the 
principles and methods to the facts of the case."" Id. at 891-92. If approved by the Judicial Conference and the United States Supreme Court, and not rejected, modified, or deferred by 
Congress, the amendments will take effect in December of 2023. Cochran, supra. Because the amendments are not in force at 
the time this decision is published, the Court does not apply the amended version of Rule 702. However, in deciding these "
1259,," motions, the Court is mindful of the proposed amendments' purpose of ""emphasiz[ing] that the court must focus on the expert's 
opinion, and must find that the opinion actually proceeds from a reliable application of the methodology"" and ""explicitly weaving 
the Rule 104(a) standard into the text of Rule 702."" Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure, at 871. "
1260,7," The ""but-for world"" or ""BFW"" is a ""construct of the world without Defendants' antitrust violation."" B & R Supermarket, Inc. v.

1261,8," In its Memorandum and Order deciding Defendants' motions to exclude the opinions of Mr. Karimzadeh, Professor Dennis W. 
Carlton, Mr. Stephen C. Mott, and Professor David P. Stowell, the Court explained that Mr. Karimzadeh may not opine as to 
parties' motivation or state of mind. (Mem. & Order, Docket Entry No. 8718.) Thus, Mr. Karimzadeh may not opine that Visa 
delayed bringing EMV to the United States in order to protect its signature debit revenue, although he may opine that the delay 
had the effect of protecting that revenue. "
1263,9," Dr. Lerner is an expert witness for Visa and the Bank Defendants. (Videotaped Dep. of Andres Lerner (""Lerner Dep."") 343:7-11, 
annexed to Wilson Decl. as Ex. 2, Docket Entry No. 8499-1; Defs.' Mem. in Opp'n to Target Pls.' Mot. to Exclude Rep. & 
Opinions of Def Expert Andres Lerner (""Lerner Opp'n"") 1, Docket Entry No. 8205.) "
1264,10," In the SAC, Plaintiffs also allege that Visa migrated to EMV without a PIN ""notwithstanding the clear security risks of that 
approach."" (SAC ¶¶ 147, 215.) However, Plaintiffs do not mention this claim in their opposition to Defendants' motion. (See Pls.' 
Opp'n.)"
1264,11," In the SAC, Plaintiffs also describe the liability shift as an anticompetitive means for Visa to force issuers to accept its 
proprietary EMV technology. (Id. at ¶¶ 213, 223.) However, Plaintiffs do not appear to rely on this antitrust theory in their 
response to Defendants' motion, instead stating that the EMV chargeback damages are ""the direct result of the core antitrust 
violation at issue in this case — the Honor All Cards Rules ('HAC Rules') and the fixed interchange they enable."" (Pls.' Opp'n 1.) "
1265,12," Plaintiffs also alleges that in the but-for world, Visa would not have imposed a short migration period in order to force issuers 
to accept its proprietary technology, although Plaintiffs do not rely upon that claim here. (Id. at ¶¶ 213, 223.)"
1265,13," As noted above, Plaintiffs also appear to allege in the SAC that the short migration period was anticompetitive because Visa 
used it to pressure issuers to accept its proprietary and anticompetitive EMV technology. (SAC at ¶¶ 213, 223.) However, 
Plaintiffs do not rely on this theory in their opposition. (See Pls.' Opp'n.) "
1267,14," Further Plaintiffs allege that the delay by Visa and Mastercard in migrating to EMV caused fraud rates in the United States to 
increase, (see SAC ¶¶ 149-150, 206-207), and point to evidence that by the mid-2000s, fraud migrated to the United States as 
the ""weak link in the international payments system,"" (Pls.' Opp'n 5-6). Thus, in a but-for world in which merchants began 
migrating to EMV by ""at least"" 2006, (Karimzadeh Reply Rep. ¶¶ 121-122), it is possible that some of the post-2015 fraud for 
which Plaintiffs became responsible never would have occurred. (See DAPs' Counterstatement ¶ 1449, Docket Entry No. 8196.) "
1270,15," Whether Plaintiffs' alleged injury is of the type the antitrust statutes were designed to prevent is closely linked to whether 
Plaintiffs have standing. To establish antitrust standing, ""a plaintiff must show (1) antitrust injury, which is 'injury of the type the 
antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flows from that which makes defendants' acts unlawful,' and (2) that he is a 
proper plaintiff in light of four 'efficient enforcer' factors[.]""' Schwab Short-Term Bond Mkt. Fund v. Lloyds Banking Grp. PLC, 22 
F.4th 103, 115 (2d Cir. 2021) (alteration in original) (quoting Meijer, Inc. v. Ferring B.V. (In re DDAVP Direct Purchaser Antitrust 
Litig.), 585 F.3d 677, 688 (2d Cir. 2009)). Since Defendants do not challenge Plaintiffs' standing in this motion, the Court does 
not conduct a standing analysis. Rather, it considers only whether EMV chargebacks are sufficiently related to Defendants' 
alleged antitrust violations to satisfy the causation prong of the antitrust inquiry. "
1271,16," The Amex Court also found that evidence of an increase in the merchant price plus low pass-through was insufficient to 
establish market power without ""some evidence that tends to prove that output was restricted or that prices were above a 
competitive level."" 138 S. Ct. at 2288. However, Professor Hausman does opine that Defendants' actions decreased output, 
(Hausman Rep. ¶¶ 420-436, Hausman Reply Rep. ¶¶ 55-76, 209-231, 386-389, 555), and Plaintiffs elsewhere point to evidence 
of the same, (DAPs' Counterstatement ¶¶ 302-396). "

1275,5," The NSA originally intended for MASON III to be a five-year contract. (Prelim. Inj. Hr'g Tr. Sept. 15 a.m. 41:9-14.) In the last 
three years, the NSA changed the OPTIMAL DECISION RFP release date at least eight times. (ECF 163-15, Pl.'s First Am. Obj.

the merger. (ECF 200-1, Pl.'s Revised Proposed Order.) "
1277,12," A Section 1 plaintiff may also use a per se theory, but the Government has elected not to pursue that here."
1277,13," The court does not discuss the potential procompetitive effects of the Proposed Acquisition in detail. However, the Proposed 
Acquisition could arguably increase competition in some areas. That is, EverWatch and Booz Allen may have a stronger position 
to challenge entrenched incumbents like Raytheon or Lockheed Martin for lucrative government contracts. (Prelim. Inj. Hr'g Tr. 
Sept. 16 a m. (Cooper) 42:23-43:13.) The existence of this argument makes a quick look approach inappropriate. Because the 
Proposed Acquisition might ""have a net procompetitive effect, or possibly no effect at all on competition, more than a 'quick look' 
is required."" See 1-800 Contacts, Inc. v. FTC, 1 F.4th 102, 115 (2d Cir. 2021) (quoting Major League Baseball Props., Inc. v. 
Salvino, Inc., 542 F.3d 290, 318 (2d Cir. 2008)) (internal punctuation omitted). "
1278,14," The three-step framework does not ""represent a rote checklist."" Alston, 141 S. Ct. at 2160. The court uses the burden-shifting

1278,16," To be sure, our evidentiary system holds sacrosanct ""excited utterances"" like these. See, e.g., Fed. R. Evid. 803(2). But even 
crediting their truth, most comments simply acknowledge that EverWatch and Booz Allen are the main competitors for OPTIMAL 
DECISION. No message explicitly expresses an intent to submit a less competitive bid. Take what may be the Government's 
strongest evidence: a Booz Allen employee asking, ""how hard we need to try to win [OPTIMAL DECISION]."" (ECF 217-18, at 
BAH_DOJ_00047426.) The Government's post-hearing brief quotes the response as follows: I don't think we have competition 
at all"" and ""I just don't see any scenario where EverWatch spends B&P [bid and proposal] on this . . . even though they can't act 
like they've been acquired yet."" (ECF 217, Pl.'s Post-Hearing Br., at 12.) The Government, however, omits a critical phrase in the 
employee's response: ""I don't think we have competition at all but I suspect Becky will have thoughts on it and will make those 
thoughts clear early on."" (ECF 217-18, at BAH_DOJ_00047426.) When Rebecca (""Becky"") Robertson weighed in her message 
was clear: Booz Allen must compete aggressively for OPTIMAL DECISION. (ECF 214-12, Gosnell Dep. 114:13-17, 118:7-17.) "
1279,17," The Government cites United States v. Aetna Inc., 240 F. Supp. 3d 1, 70 (D.D.C. 2017), in arguing that ""contemporaneous 
email exchanges"" are more persuasive than ""in-court attempts to explain or disavow those documented exchanges."" But that 
case involved contemporaneous emails sent by executives of the company. Id. at 67."
1279,18," In addition to traditional discovery, the Government used Civil Investigative Demands for pre-litigation information gathering. 
See 15 U.S.C. § 1312. "
1280,19," Booz Allen and EverWatch have committed to submit separate bids, stick with those bids, implement various firewalls between 
the two bidding teams, and create financial incentives for the winning team. The defendants committed to implementing these 
procedures even if the court declines to mandate the defendants complete these actions. (Closing Arg. Tr. 41:2-25.)"
1280,20," ""Sole source"" negotiations are bilateral price negotiations that don't include other bidders. The negotiations include only the 
NSA and the prime contractor, not subcontractors. (Prelim. Inj. Hr'g Tr. Sept. 15 p.m. (Kevin Y.) 33:24-34:5.) "
1281,21," Curiously, Dr. Chicu considers the April 2019 ""no cost"" extension as an example of a competitive market, despite the 
extension being ""sole sourced"" to Booz Allen."
1281,22," The Government asserts that Booz Allen's bidding strategy in the JUNGLE PRINCE contract supports its theory. But the 
record concerning JUNGLE PRINCE is insufficiently developed, and information about the contract may have been withheld 
from discovery. Accordingly, the court will not draw conclusions from the Government's passing references to JUNGLE PRINCE."
1281,23," See, e.g., Prelim. Inj. Hr'g Tr. Sept. 15 a.m. (Dr. S.) 119:19-21 (""Q: You would agree [Booz Allen] ha[s] been an effective 
mission partner with you throughout the whole time? A: They have been an effective mission partner, yes.""); Prelim. Inj. Hr'g Tr. 
Sept. 15 p.m. (Kevin Y.) 38:3-7 (""Q: You can't recall a single situation with Booz Allen where you were negotiating with them on 
a contract and the end result was anything other than a fair and reasonable price, can you, sir? A: No."")"
1281,24," The parties dispute whether the adjustments for inflation by the expert witnesses account for rising labor costs. The court need 
not resolve that dispute because other evidence in the record, such as the increased demand for talent from other industries, 
sufficiently explains those cost increases for now."
1281,25," Dr. Chicu adjusts for inflation by relying on the BLS Employment Cost Index for ""private industry workers in professional, 
scientific, and technical services."" See ECF 217-25, Chicu Amend. Decl., at USDOJ-019-00000393-001 n.1.) The ""professional,

and payroll services; architectural, engineering, and specialized design services; computer services; consulting services; 
research services; advertising services; photographic services; translation and interpretation services; veterinary services; and 
other professional, scientific, and technical services."" See U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Professional, Scientific, and Technical 
Services, https://www.bls.gov/iag/tgs/iag54 htm. "
1282,26," To be clear, the NSA's power to tinker with a contractor's profit does not immunize defense contractors from antitrust scrutiny. 
An agency's regulatory power to mitigate anticompetitive effects is simply another consideration when evaluating whether a firm 
is likely to cause a significant anticompetitive harm."
1282,27," ""An economic arrangement between companies performing similar functions in the production or sale of comparable goods or 
services is characterized as 'horizontal.' The effect on competition of such an arrangement depends, of course, upon its 
character and scope. Thus, its validity in the face of the antitrust laws will depend upon such factors as: the relative size and 
number of the parties to the arrangement; whether it allocates shares of the market among the parties; whether it fixes prices at 
which the parties will sell their product; or whether it absorbs or insulates competitors."" Brown Shoe, 370 U.S. at 334-35."
1282,28," A relevant antitrust market has two distinct but related elements—a geographic market and product market. Brown Shoe Co. 
v. United States, 370 U.S. 294, 324, 82 S. Ct. 1502, 8 L. Ed. 2d 510 (1962). Here, the geographic component is the United 
States. The NSA is the only customer in the Government's proposed market, and the NSA must procure OPTIMAL DECISION 
services from domestic companies. (See Prelim. Inj. Hr'g Tr. Sept. 15 p m. (Chicu) 61:11-18.) The parties dispute the product 
component. "
1283,29," Modeling and simulation at the ""enterprise level"" means the models look ""across the entire NSA cryptologic enterprise."" 
(Prelim. Inj. Hr'g Tr. Sept. 15 a m. (Dunshee) 40:16-24.)"
1283,30," Consider the largest technology companies for example. These companies likely use modeling and simulation services to 
analyze data on their own networks. No two networks are the same; data collected by Amazon is likely different than the data 
gathered by Apple and Tesla. If the Government were correct, then each company's use of modeling and simulation services 
would constitute a separate market. "
1284,31," The Government's curates its market based on a moment suspended in time. With only a few weeks left until the bidding 
deadline, it is likely only Booz Allen and EverWatch will submit a bid. But a snapshot at the finish line says nothing about the 
competitors running the race initially."
1284,32," Unpublished cases are cited for the soundness of their reasoning, not for their precedential value. "
1285,33," Other courts have distinguished these military weaponry cases in a similar manner. See Int'l Logistics Grp., Ltd. v. Chrysler 
Corp., No. 85-CV-70047-DT, 1988 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18225, 1988 WL 106905, at *8 (E.D. Mich. Apr. 8, 1988), aff'd, 884 F.2d 904 
(6th Cir. 1989) (""In Northrop, it is true that there were no other customers for the F—18 weapons system; but neither were there 
any other customers for anything that could be regarded as a reasonable substitute for this weapons system."")."
1285,34," And even in looking at that contract, Dr. Chicu identified a non-competitive extension of MASON III as an extension with 
competition. See infra Section III.A.2.ii."
1285,35," The Government argues that it does not need to show irreparable harm because such harm is presumed in cases brought by 
the United States under statutes permitting injunctive relief. The court disagrees. The primary case for the Government's 
proposition is In re Sanctuary Belize Litig., 409 F. Supp. 3d 380, 396, 419 (D. Md. 2019). But that case concerned a specific "
1286,," statute stating a different standard for preliminary relief for the FTC, not the DOJ. Generally, a plaintiff must satisfy each of the 
four factors to prevail on a motion for a preliminary injunction. See eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, L.L.C., 547 U.S. 388, 391, 126 S. 
Ct. 1837, 164 L. Ed. 2d 641 (2006) (noting preliminary injunction requirements based on ""well-established principles of equity"" in 
the context of the Patent Act); see also Salinger v. Colting, 607 F.3d 68, 77-78 (2d Cir. 2010) (""[N]othing in the text or the logic of 
eBay suggests that its rule is limited to patent cases. On the contrary, eBay strongly indicates that the traditional principles of 
equity it employed are the presumptive standard for injunctions in any context.""). "
1290,1," For the purpose of antitrust law, horizontal competitors are participants at the ""same level of the market structure."" United 
States v. Topco Assoc., Inc., 405 U.S. 596, 608, 92 S. Ct. 1126, 31 L. Ed. 2d 515 (1972). Agreements to fix prices or rig bids 
among horizontal competitors are judged by the per se standard, whereas agreements among vertical market participants, such 
as a manufacturer of a product and its distributor, are generally judged by a different standard. Id. "
1295,1," After carefully considering the papers filed in connection with the Motion, the Court deemed the matter appropriate for decision 
without oral argument. Fed. R. Civ. P. 78; C.D. Cal. L.R. 7-15."
1295,2," Consumers other than homeowners did and do use Angie's List, but to avoid potential confusion over the use of the word 
""consumers,"" the Court refers to those who visit Angie's List seeking to pay service providers to perform tasks as ""homeowners."" 
(See Decl. Chase Traughber (""Traughber Decl."") ¶ 2, ECF No. 84-5.) "
1297,3," The record on this point is somewhat muddled, but it appears that, at least conceptually, the SR Path is a distinct feature from 
Angie's List's ""Request-A-Quote"" feature, which it introduced to its site in 2018. (Traughber Decl. ¶ 14.) The Request-A-Quote 
feature allows homeowners to submit information about their jobs to service providers and obtain individualized quotes for the 
jobs. Angie's List service providers whom homeowners contact using the Request-A-Quote feature do receive the homeowner's 
contact information. (Traughber Dep. ISO Opp'n 265:5-15.) "
1298,4," The Court omits discussion of the contract claim that is unique to Pro Water. The Court previously found that portion of the 
contract claim to be well-pleaded, but that claim relates to Pro Water's allegation that Angie's List improperly charged it for a 
month of advertising services without providing those services. (Order Mot. Dismiss SAC 13-14, ECF No. 59.) That claim is 
unique to Pro Water and is not a part of the present Motion. "
1301,5," Some courts recognize a second element to the balancing test. In addition to requiring the plaintiff to show that the harm to the 
consumer outweighs the utility of the practice, these courts further require that the plaintiffs show that the practice is ""immoral, 
unethical, oppressive, unscrupulous, or substantially injurious to the consumer."" See Drum v. San Fernando Valley Bar Assn., 
182 Cal. App. 4th 247, 257, 106 Cal. Rptr. 3d 46 (2010). Regardless, the Court need not make this legal determination; as 
discussed herein, certification fails because the first element generates commonality and predominance problems without 
reference to the putative second element. "
1302,6," Pro Water asserts in passing that the fact that some Class members were given estimates is ""no reason to deny certification, 
because the class definition can easily be amended to exclude class members who received such agreements."" (Reply 8.) But 
because the proportion of Class members who received estimates is not at all insubstantial, excluding these would 
fundamentally change the nature and composition of the Class. Moreover, some Class members did not receive estimates at the 
beginning of the Class period and began receiving estimates at some point during the class period. Nowhere in its briefs does 
Pro Water articulate a plausible proposal for dealing with such class members or, more generally, for amending the class 
definition in so fundamental a way. "
1304,7," As Pro Water is a consumer of Angie's List's services, rather than a service provider platform that competes directly with 
Angie's List, Pro Water's UCL claim is a ""consumer"" UCL claim, not a business competitor UCL claim. See Cel-Tech, 20 Cal. 4th 
at 187 (recognizing this distinction and its importance). "

1376,10," Even assuming arguendo that MonoSol did reach an agreement with Reckitt regarding tablet withdrawal, it is not clear that 
mere introduction of a new product combined with withdrawal of the prior product, standing alone, could be the basis of an 
unlawful antitrust conspiracy. It is well settled that ""neither product withdrawal nor product improvement alone is anticompetitive."" 
New York ex rel. Schneiderman v. Actavis PLC, 787 F.3d 638, 653-54 (2d Cir. 2015) (""Namenda""). The States rely on the 
Second Circuit decision in Namenda, wherein the court found that a drug manufacturer's hard switch—i.e., the combination of 
withdrawing their originally branded drug and introducing a new, non-AB-rated version of that drug—forced patients who 
depended on that therapy to switch to the new version of the drug ""and would likely impede generic competition by precluding 
generic substitution through state drug substitution laws."" Id. at 654. "
1377,," Since Namenda, however, courts have indicated that some conduct beyond the hard switch is necessary to prove unlawful, 
anticompetitive conduct. See, e.g., In re Loestrin 24 Fe Antitrust Litigation, 433 F. Supp. 3d 274, 330-31 (D.R.I. 2019) ( ""[T]o 
sustain a claim, a hard switch must be accompanied by additional evidence that [the defendants'] anticompetitive conduct 
coerced consumers to switch from [one product to another] . . . Thus, Plaintiffs must identify evidence of conduct beyond the 
hard switch that could support a jury finding that [a defendant] employed anticompetitive conduct to coerce consumers to switch 
from [one product to another].""); Mylan Pharms Inc. v. Warner Chilcott Public Ltd., 838 F.3d 421, 440 (3d Cir. 2016) (""Doryx"") 
(affirming that the conduct evidenced a lawful soft switch, but also appreciating that ""certain insignificant design or formula 
changes, combined with other coercive conduct, could present a closer call with respect to establishing liability""). Absent some showing of MonoSol's participation or agreement to the entirety of the alleged antitrust, it is not clear, as a matter 
of law, whether simple participation in the hard switch—i.e., the introduction of film and the withdrawal of tablets—would be 
sufficient to hold MonoSol liable for an antitrust conspiracy. Nonetheless, as I find that there was no meeting of the minds even 
as to withdrawal, I need not resolve this issue."
1377,11," The States cite to my decision on MonoSol's Motion to Dismiss in this case, wherein I found that the allegations of the 
Amended Complaint permitted the plausible inference that MonoSol and Reckitt engaged in concerted action with MonoSol on a 
significant portion of the alleged product hop scheme. In re Suboxone, 16-cv-5073, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 179101, 2017 WL 
4910673, at *11 (E.D. Pa. Oct. 30, 2017). For purposes of a motion to dismiss, I found such allegations, taken as true, were 
sufficient to state a plausible claim that the two companies had a meeting of the minds to engage in a joint scheme that would 
allow Reckitt to monopolize the relevant market. However, the evidence produced by the States after the pleading stage—even taken in the light most favorable to the States—
has not borne out the theory that such a meeting of the minds occurred. Indeed, the States have conceded that MonoSol did not 
participate in the disparagement of tablets, pricing of tablets, the Citizen Petition, or the alleged REMS delay. As completely 
different standards apply, the denial of MonoSol's motion to dismiss does not dictate the outcome of MonoSol's motion for 
summary judgment. "

1382,2," While Pandora is unclear on this point, the Court surmises that ""undesirable"" refers to bad comedians or bad jokes. (E.g., 
What's the difference between a Federal Judge and God? God doesn't think he's a Federal Judge.) "
1385,3," In certain instances, ""in order to permit the full enjoyment of a right expressly, granted[,] there is a necessary implication that 
certain collateral rights have also been granted."" 3 Nimmer on Copyright § 10.10[C] (2022). The Court does not address at this 
stage whether the Comedians impliedly granted Pandora all rights necessary to fully perform their works."
1385,4, The Court uses the pagination automatically generated by CM/ECF for Exhibit C. 
1390,5," The Court accepts Pandora's judicial admission of this fact. . See Am. Title Ins. Co. v. Lacelaw Corp., 861 F.2d 224, 226 (9th 
Cir. 1988) (""Factual assertions in pleadings and pretrial documents, unless amended, are considered judicial admissions 
conclusively binding on the party who made them.""). "
1396,1, The court addresses the plaintiff's Motion to Dismiss the PSI defendants' Counterclaims in a separate Memorandum and Order.
1396,2," All of the facts set forth herein are drawn from the SAC and exhibits attached to the original Complaint and incorporated by 
reference in the SAC. The court provides citations only when quoting directly."
1396,3," The court refers herein to defendant Pat Murphy by his last name only and to Techmatic's principal, John Murphy, by both first 
and last name. The record does not reflect that Pat Murphy and John Murphy are related. "
1401,4," The SAC characterizes the civil RICO claim as brought pursuant to ""18 U.S.C. §§ 1964(c)-(d)."" (SAC 22 (Count I).) The court 
presumes, based on context, that the plaintiff intended to refer to 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c)-(d). "
1406,5," PSI also argues that Pavco terminated its distributorship agreement with Techmatic as a result of Techmatic's ""failure and 
refusal to honor the exclusive nature of its distributorship relationship with Pavco."" (Doc. No. 84, at 17-18.) This assertion directly 
conflicts with the allegations in the SAC that the proffered rationale was pretextual, as Pavco knew about and long tolerated 
Techmatic's distribution of other chemical producers' products, and it also allegedly allows PSI to sell other producers' products. 
The court, therefore, disregards this argument. "
1407,6," Logically, it seems likely that Pavco already possessed that information, since Techmatic's customers were also its customers. 
For purposes of the defendants' motions, however, the court accepts as true the SAC's allegations (or implication) that it 
obtained that information from Murphy, O'Rourke, and/or Greve. "
1408,7," ""Bid rigging"" ""refers to horizontal price fixing whereby two or more suppliers (or occasionally purchasers) secretly fix the price at 
which they will bid."" Stop & Shop Supermarket Co. v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of R.I., 373 F.3d 57, 62 (1st Cir. 2004) (citing

1408,8," As the Supreme Court has explained, ""[o]ne of the classic examples of a per se violation of § 1 is an agreement between 
competitors at the same level of the market structure to allocate territories in order to minimize competition."" United States v. 
Topco Assocs., Inc., 405 U.S. 596, 608, 92 S. Ct. 1126, 31 L. Ed. 2d 515 (1972), quoted in United States v. Coop. Theatres of

boycott,"" for purposes of the per se rule, ""is principally reserved for cases in which competitors agree with each other not to deal 
with a supplier or distributor if it continues to serve a competitor whom they seek to injure"")."
1408,10," A tying arrangement is defined ""as an agreement by a party to sell one product . . . only on the condition that the buyer also 
purchases a different (or tied) product, or at least agrees that he will not purchase that product from any other supplier."" Mich. 
Div.-Monument Builders of N. Am. v. Mich. Cemetery Ass'n, 524 F.3d 726, 732 (6th Cir. 2008) (quoting N. Pac. Ry. Co. v. United 
States, 356 U.S. 1, 5-6, 78 S. Ct. 514, 2 L. Ed. 2d 545 (1958)). The Supreme Court has held that, ""in all cases involving a tying 
arrangement, the plaintiff must prove that the defendant has market power in the tying product."" Ill. Tool Works Inc. v. Indep. Ink,

1409,11," ""Interbrand competition is the competition among the manufacturers of the same generic product . . . and is the primary 
concern of antitrust law."" Crane & Shovel, 854 F.2d at 806 (referencing television sets as an example of such a ""generic 
product""). ""[I]ntrabrand competition is the competition between the distributors—wholesale or retail—of the product of a 
particular manufacturer."" Id. Thus, for example, to the extent that both Techmatic and PSI sold Pavco products within the same 
geographic region, they were intrabrand competitors. "
1410,12," The court, for purposes of this analysis, disregards the plaintiff's allegations regarding the absence of intrabrand competition 
resulting from its termination as a distributor of Pavco products—that is, the allegations that PSI is now Pavco's exclusive 
distributor in what was the region occupied by Techmatic. As set forth above, the Sherman Act is not concerned with this type of 
injury. "
1411,13," Notably, Techmatic alleges that its sales and profits have decreased by 80% since February 1, 2020 (SAC ¶ 130), but it does 
not indicate how much of that decrease is due solely to its loss of its ability to distribute Pavco products and how much, if any, is 
attributable to a decrease in the sales of its own proprietary products and those of other manufacturers. "
1413,14," A ""protected computer"" is defined as any computer ""used in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce or communication."" 18 
U.S.C. § 1030(e)(2)(B). "
1414,15," Paragraph 227 actually asserts as follows: O'Rourke, Greve, and Pat Murphy, with the encouragement and/or assistance of PSI, Greene, and Schroer, intentionally 
accessed Techmatic's protected computers without authorization—which had expired and been revoked upon their 
resignations—to obtain emails, customer information, trade secrets, and other sensitive business information in violation of 
18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(2)(C). "
1416,16," The Tennessee Supreme Court remanded for reconsideration based on its intervening opinion in Rye v. Women's Care 
Center of Memphis, MPLLC, 477 S.W.3d 235 (Tenn. 2015), which altered Tennessee's standard of review of summary judgment 
motions to match the federal standard. "
1421,17," The PSI defendants have not sought dismissal based on the intracorporate conspiracy doctrine, and it appears that, although 
Murphy, Greve, and O'Rourke are now employed by PSI, at the time they allegedly engaged in most of the wrongful activity, they 
were still employed by Techmatic, suggesting that the doctrine would not apply. "
1424,1," Microsoft's causation standard asked whether (1) ""the exclusion of nascent threats is the type of conduct that is reasonably 
capable of contributing significantly to a defendant's continued monopoly power"" and (2) ""the [potential competitors] reasonably 
constituted nascent threats at the time"" of the anticompetitive conduct. 253 F.3d at 79. "
1432,1," To argue that Defendants owed him a duty of care, Plaintiff points to Biakanja v. Irving, 49 Cal. 2d 647, 649, 320 P.2d 16 
(1958), which involved a third party's economic injury arising from the negligent performance of a contract. (Opp'n 11-13.). 
Courts apply the Biakanja factors to determine whether an exception to the economic loss rule is warranted when an injured 
third party is not in privity of contract. See Centinela Freeman Emergency Med. Assocs. v. Health Net of Cal., Inc., 1 Cal. 5th 
994, 1013-14, 209 Cal. Rptr. 3d 280, 382 P.3d 1116 (2016). Here, Plaintiff claims damages ""in excess of $10,000,000 because 
of the physical injury done to him and the reduction in his quality of life as a result,"" which is not a purely economic loss. (FAC ¶¶ 
26, 30 (emphases added).) Given Biakanja's limited application, see United Guar. Mortg. Indem. Co. v. Countrywide Fin. Corp., 
660 F. Supp. 2d 1163, 1180 n.18 (2009) (citing Stop Loss Ins. Brokers, Inc. v. Brown & Toland Med. Grp., 143 Cal. App. 4th 
1036, 1042-43, 49 Cal. Rptr. 3d 609 (2006)), the Court disregards Plaintiff's Biakanja argument. "

1443,2," The Court appreciated hearing the testimony of many dedicated professionals who work in the publishing industry. The Court 
heard from authors Charles Duhigg, Stephen King, and Andrew Solomon. Publisher witnesses included: Jennifer Bergstrom, 
Senior Vice President and Publisher of the S&S imprint Gallery Books Group (""Gallery""); Sally Kim, Senior Vice President and 
Publisher of the PRH imprint G.P. Putnam's Sons (""Putnam""); Liate Stehlik, President and Publisher of Morrow Group, 
HarperCollins Publishers; and Brian Tart, President and Publisher of the PRH imprint Viking Penguin (""Viking""). The following 
literary agents testified: Elyse Cheney, Christy Fletcher, Ayesha Pande, Gail Ross, Jennifer Rudolph Walsh (expert witness), 
and Andrew Wylie. The Court also heard from top industry executives, including Markus Dohle, CEO of PRH; Dennis Eulau, 
Executive Vice President and COO of S&S; John Glusman, Vice President and Editor in Chief of W.W. Norton & Company 
(""Norton""); Michael Jacobs, President and CEO of Abrams Books; Jonathan Karp, President and CEO of S&S; Madeline

economic expert was Dr. Nicholas Hill, and the defendants' economic expert was Professor Edward Snyder. Finally, Adriana 
Porro, a statistician for U.S. Department of Justice, Antitrust Division, also testified. The following witnesses testified by video: Christy Fletcher, John Glusman, Michael Jacobs, Andrew Solomon, Liate Stehlik, and

1445,3," Royalties are payments made to the author based on a book's sales. See Trial Tr. at 106:20-107:25 (Pietsch). For example, 
authors earn 7.5 percent of sales for paperback books. See id. at 255:24-256:20 (Pande), 2011:9-10 (Kim). An advance is an 
upfront payment of those anticipated royalties; the author is not required to pay back the advance even if the book's actual 
royalties never exceed the amount of the advance. See id. at 106:20-107:25 (Pietsch). Advances are paid in installments, 
typically in quarters. Generally, the first installment is paid upon the signing of the book contract; the second payment is made 
upon delivery and acceptance of the manuscript; the third installment is paid upon publication; and the fourth payment is made 
twelve months later. See id. at 777:1-19 (Dohle), 1829:11-15 (Walsh), 255:1-25 (Pande). It can take three to four years for an 
entire advance to be paid to an author. See id. at 255:15-18 (Pande), 777:1-19 (Dohle)."
1445,4," See Trial Tr. at 108:2-12 (Pietsch) (""Roughly half the time. About half the books we [Hachette] publish earn out their 
advances.""), 254:20-24 (Pande) (20% of authors represented by Pande's agency earned out advance), 1239:25-1240:8 (Hill) 
(more than 85% of author contracts for anticipated top-selling books never earn out their advance), 2101:3-5 (Wylie) (5% of 
books he represents earn out their advances)."
1445,5," Generally, paperback books receive a 7.5-percent royalty rate; e-books and audio or digital downloads receive 25 percent of 
net sales; and hardcover books get a 10-percent rate for the first 5,000 copies sold, 12.5 percent for copies 5,000 to 10,000, and 
15 percent of sales exceeding 10,000 copies. See Trial Tr. at 255:24-256:20 (Pande), 2011:4-15 (Kim). "
1446,6," More than half of books are sold through negotiations. See Trial Tr. at 1608:20-1609:1 (Hill) (explaining that 60% of books with 
advances over $250,000 involve negotiations, with the remaining 40% being auctions); see also id. at 478:15-479:1 (Karp) 
(explaining that less than half of acquisitions are auctions because S&S has ""so many repeat authors), 771:11-14 (Dohle)

1451,13," The government's theory is that the combined defendants would exercise market power on the buy-side of the publishing 
market, i.e., monopsony. Although most antitrust law has developed under sell-side theories of harm, i.e., monopoly, 
monopsony analysis relies on similar principles. Under the Horizontal Merger Guidelines, discussed infra at n.15, ""to evaluate 
whether a merger is likely to enhance market power on the buying side of the market, the Agencies employ essentially the 
framework described ... for evaluating whether a merger is likely to enhance market power on the selling side of the market.""

on the selling side."" United States v. Syufy Enters. 903 F.2d 659, 663 n.4 (9th Cir. 1990) (quotations omitted)."
1451,14," Although defendants quote United States v. Marine Bancorporation, 418 U.S. 602, 623 n.22, 94 S. Ct. 2856, 41 L. Ed. 2d 978 
(1974), for the proposition that a merger's anticompetitive effects must also be ""imminent"" to violate the Clayton Act, see Defs. 
PCOL ¶ 1, the full quotation from that case is that ""the loss of competition 'which is sufficiently probable and imminent' is the 
concern of § 7,"" Marine Bancorp., 418 U.S. at 623 n.22 (emphasis added) (citation omitted). The Court understands that 
description of the standard to be functionally indistinguishable from the D.C. Circuit's formulation of the Section 7 standard, as 
described above."
1451,15," In United States v. AT&T, Inc., the D.C. Circuit described the Section 7 standard of proof as follows: ""[T]he government must 
show that the proposed merger is likely to substantially lessen competition, which encompasses a concept of 'reasonable 
probability.'"" 916 F.3d 1029, 1032, 439 U.S. App. D.C. 388 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (emphasis deleted) (quoting Brown Shoe, 370 U.S. 
at 323 n.39). The parties dispute the meaning of this language. The defendants argue that AT&T ""require[s the government] to 
prove that a merger is 'likely' to cause substantial harm to competition, [not] only that harm 'may' occur."" Defs. PCOL ¶ 2. The "
1452,," government points to AT&T s explanation ""that this standard encompasses a concept of 'reasonable probability,'"" arguing that 
AT&T requires something less than what the defendants propose. See Govt. PFOF-PCOL ¶¶ 38, 40; see also id. ¶ 38 (arguing 
for an ""appreciable danger"" standard). The root of these competing formulations maybe uncertainty over how the government's 
preponderance-of-the-evidence burden interacts with Section 7's already probabilistic standard; combined, the two standards 
require the government to prove ""by a preponderance of the evidence"" that the effect of a challenged merger or acquisition ""may 
be substantially to lessen competition."" Anthem, 236 F. Supp. 3d at 192. Like the district court in AT&T, this Court ""need not 
further toil over discerning or articulating the daylight, if any, between 'appreciable danger,' 'probable,' 'reasonably probable,' and 
'likely' as used in the Section 7 context."" United States v. AT&T, 310 F. Supp. 3d 161, 189 n.16 (D.D.C. 2018). The selection of 
any of the competing permutations is not outcome-determinative in this case."
1452,16," The Merger Guidelines ""outline the principal analytical techniques, practices, and the enforcement policy of the Department of 
Justice and the Federal Trade Commission"" for merging competitors under federal antitrust laws. Merger Guidelines § 1. They 
""describe the principal analytical techniques and the main types of evidence on which the Agencies usually rely to predict 
whether a horizontal merger may substantially lessen competition."" Id. Although the Merger Guidelines are not binding, courts 
have consistently looked to them for guidance in merger cases. See, e.g., FTC v. Sysco Corp., 113 F. Supp. 3d 1, 38 (D.D.C. 
2015). "
1454,17," As for other Big Five publishers. Hachette does not have a company-wide approval policy, but its different imprints require 
approval for offers from above $100.000 to above $250,000. See Trial Tr. at 232:21-233:5 (Pietsch) (""All our publishers have 
advance approval levels and they are clustered right around [$250.000].""). Hachette also tracks the books it lost for advances of 
$500.000 or more. See PX 790. [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] See Trial Tr. at 1438:8-11 (Murray). [TEXT REDACTED 
BY THE COURT] See id. at 11701:7-1102:13 (Wetsberg); DX 408. "
1456,18," In support, the defendants primarily rely on In re Super Premium Ice Cream Distribution Antitrust Litig., 691 F. Supp. 1262 
(N.D. Cal. 1988), aff'd sub nom. Haagen-Dazs Co. v. Double Rainbow Gourmet Ice Creams, Inc., 895 F.2d 1417 (9th Cir. 
1990), and United States v. Oracle Corp., 331 F. Supp. 2d 1098 (N.D. Cal. 2004). The Court finds both In re Super Premium Ice 
Cream and Oracle inapposite. Neither case concerns a market of targeted sellers or buyers, as relevant to this case. Further, in 
In re Super Premium Ice Cream, the evidence showed that consumers who bought higher-priced ""super premium"" ice cream 
could and would buy lower-quality ice cream as a substitute. See 691 F. Supp. at 1268. Here, authors of anticipated top-selling 
books have no alternative to selling their books to a publisher because, as addressed in Section I.C, self-publishing is not a 
realistic alternative. Because they have no reasonable substitute, authors can be targeted for and impacted by a decrease in 
prices, in a manner that ice-cream customers could not have been targeted by a price increase. As for Oracle, there, the 
government attempted to define a market of ""high function"" software and tried to use a minimum sale price of $500,000 to 
identify such software. See 331 F. Supp. 2d at 1158 Yet there were several flaws in the data analyzed and presented by the 
government's expert. See id. at 1158-59. Nor did the government offer any other qualitative or quantitative evidence to define 
the market See id. Here, Dr. Hill's data suffers from no similar flaws and the government has marshalled evidence beyond the 
advance price to show practical indicia of a submarket for the publishing rights to anticipated top-selling books. "
1457,19," For example, Crown, a former publishing division of PRH that later merged with the Random House division, produced 
guidelines for marketing support based on expected sales and advance levels. See PX 986; Trial Tr. at 2275:19-2278:1 
(McIntosh). Under those guidelines, books with expected sales of more than 25,000 units or advances of more than $150,000 
were to receive a dedicated publicist, book tours with stops in 5 to 15 markets, extensive national media engagement, prominent 
placement on PRH and partner websites, and targeted social media pushes. See PX 986 at 2-4. By contrast, hooks with 
advances and sales under those thresholds were to have only a contact in the publicity department, smaller book tours (if any), 
and limited media engagement. See id. at 5-9."
1457,20," Some of the defendants' witnesses testified that all books are anticipated to sell well. See Trial Tr. at 576:17-24 (""[Al good 
editor worries about every book that he or she acquires, making every book profitable.""), 1810:17-1812:4 (Walsh) (""I would say I 
always anticipate that what I am working on is going to be a best seller.""). That assertion is not credible. Although an agent, "
1458,," author, or publisher may ""hope"" every book will be a hit, that is not the same as anticipating or expecting that a book will do well. 
See id. at 1813:4-6 (The Court: ""You don't expect every single book you work on to be a best seller or top seller?"" Walsh: ""Right. 
I hope.""); see also id. at 328:2-10 (King) (explaining that he chose a smaller publisher for a book that ""wasn't a crafted best 
seller""), 593:21-594:8 (Karp) (recognizing that some books are ""midlist"" books that publishers are ""hoping,"" but not anticipating, 
will be hits)."
1458,21," See Trial Tr. at 258:14-21 (Pande) (""I would say that there's a pretty clear relationship between the level of the advance and 
the amount of resources that the publisher invests in the marketing and publicity of the book.""), 490:13-492:4 (Karp) (""[T]he big 
obvious books that we spent a lot of money for, they definitely have to be marketed and publicized aggressively.""), 1373:1-11 
(Murray), 2001:12-2002:4 (Kim); PX 989 (Putnam post-publication P&L sheet) (showing general correlation between advance 
level and marketing spending)."
1458,22," ""Lead titles"" or ""priority titles"" are expected to sell well and receive more significant marketing, publicity, and sales support. 
See PX 986 (Crown internal guidance identifying ""lead titles"" as books with a sales goal of 75,000 units or advances of 
$500,000, and advising increased marketing, sales, and publicity support for those titles); PX 2005 at 24-27; Trial Tr. at 1071:4-
1072:15 (Weisberg) (defining lead title as ""top of the list""), 1988:19 25 (Kim) (""So every season, we have two or three titles that 
we really designate as lead titles, titles that we feel we really want the sales team to really love and read, books that we feel we "
1459,," want to put a lot of attention on and marketing support for.""). They also generally receive high advances. See Trial Tr. 1071:4-
1072:15 (Weisberg) (""[I]f we spend a lot of money on a book and it's a book that everybody loves, it becomes a lead title.""), 
2268:9 2269:22 (McIntosh) (""[I]f we had a really high sales expectation at time of acquisition and then by the time we're ready to 
publish the book, we still have a sales a high sales expectation, then it would seem logical to me that - that there could be a high 
advance attached to that.""). "
1460,23," To define a market around a targeted seller, sellers must not only be identifiable by buyers for differential pricing but also must 
be unable to engage in arbitrage or opportunistic re-selling. See Staples II, 190 F. Supp. 3d at 117-118; Merger Guidelines § 3. 
The foregoing discussion establishes that anticipated top-selling books are subject to differential pricing. Authors of those books 
also cannot realistically engage in arbitrage by selling their books to a third party who would then sell the books to publishers for 
a better price. See Trial Tr. at 1230:7-23 (Hill). As Dr. Hill testified, publishers would still need to read the book or proposal and 
value it in the same manner as if the book were submitted directly by the author. See id. "
1461,24," For this reason, the defendants' argument that the government has not defined the ""narrowest market,"" as required by some 
case law, lacks merit. See Defs. PCOL ¶¶ 35-41 (citing Merger Guidelines § 4.1.1; RAG-Stiftung, 436 F. Supp. 3d at 292; Sysco, 
113 F. Supp. 3d at 26-27; United States v. H & R Block, Inc., 833 F. Supp. 2d 36, 58-60 (D.D.C. 2011); FTC v. Arch Coal, Inc., 
329 F. Supp. 2d 109, 120 (D.D.C. 2004)). The cases relied upon by the defendants focus on defining the market by reference to 
demand substitution and applying the hypothetical monopolist test, while the instant case concerns a market defined by targeted 
sellers as articulated by the Merger Guidelines. See Merger Guidelines § 4.1.4 (""If prices are negotiated individually with 
customers, the hypothetical monopolist test may suggest relevant markets that are as narrow as individual customers .... 
Nonetheless, the Agencies often define markets for groups of targeted customers, i.e., by type of customer, rather than by 
individual customer. By so doing, the Agencies are able to rely on aggregated market shares that can be more helpful in 
predicting the competitive effects of the merger.""). "
1463,25," Moreover, post-merger HHIs (and the post-merger increase) also are above the presumption thresholds if the relevant market 
is defined using a variety of other advance cutoffs (e.g., $150,000, $350,000, $500,000, or $1 million). Trial Tr. at 1254:7-25 
(Hill); see also PX 960. "
1465,26," Professor Snyder's agency data is less comprehensive than Dr. Hill's data set. The eighteen literary agencies that provided 
information in response to subpoenas are only a subset of the agents in the industry. See Trial Tr. at 2657:7-25 (Snyder). Of the 
973 contracts examined by Professor Snyder, from 2018 to 2021, only 360 earned advances per title of $250,000 or more. See 
id. Of those 360 contracts, Professor Snyder could not identify a clear runner-up in 61 instances. See Trial Tr. at 2658:12-15 
(Snyder). The remaining pool of data, relatively small and unrepresentative as it was, see Trial Tr. at 1289:22-1292:12 (Hill), 
indicated that PRH and S&S were the winner and runner-up in only 7 percent of the cases, while market shares would have 
predicted that they would be winner and runner-up in 12 percent of the cases. See Trial Tr. at 1588:7-19 (Hill), 2797:20-2798:6 
(Snyder). Notably, Professor Snyder's estimate of diversion from S&S to PRH is based on a sample of only 22 books over four 
years, the smallest sample of all the data sets used to estimate diversion. Trial Tr. at 1291:15-1292:12 (Hill), 1707:20-1708:1 
(Hill); PX 996 at 1."
1465,27," Defendants presented testimony to the contrary, suggesting that the lost competition between PRH and S&S would not harm 
authors or their advances; and that it instead might lead to an increase in advance levels. See Defs. PFOF ¶¶ 25-26 (suggesting 
that savings from the merger would allow the combined company to spend more money to acquire books, which in turn would 
force competitors to offer higher advances), 115-116 (stressing that PRH and competitors have no plans to lower advances). For 
example, S&S CEO Jonathan Karp testified that the company has no plans to decrease author advances or reduce title count 
post-merger, see Trial Tr. at 583:13-19; and PRH Head of Global Mergers & Acquisitions Manuel Sansigre did not consider the 
potential for reduced author compensation when projecting the merger's efficiencies for PRH, see id at 2532:25-2533:12. In 
addition, HarperCollins CEO Brian Murray stated that his company had not discussed author advances decreasing due to the 
merger, see id. at 1407:24-1408:12; and that [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT], see id. at 1447:3-19, 1452:9-14. The Court 
finds testimony that the merger will have either no effect or positive effects on advances incredible. The Court instead credits the 
much stronger evidence that advances will decrease after the merger, based on the market-share data, economic analyses, and 
the more credible testimony regarding market dynamics discussed supra. "
1466,28," Dr. Hill gave two examples that demonstrate how the number of bidders influences a publisher's bidding strategy in best-bids 
auctions. In a 2019 best-bids auction for a young adult novel, an S&S editor wrote that, because there were only three bidders, ""I 
think we can be more guarded in our bidding."" See Trial Tr. at 1267:15-22 (Hill). In a 2020 best-bids auction for a book by a 
musician, a PRH editor wrote, ""Another editor and I discussed bringing our offer significantly down yesterday based on the 
sense I got from the agent that she doesn't have many interested bidders."" See id. at 1267:23-1268:1 (Hill). "
1467,29," Variable-profit margin is equal to revenue minus variable costs. The metric does not account for, i.e., subtract, fixed costs. See 
Trial Tr. at 1310:2-25 (Hill)."
1467,30," Both the second-score auction model and the GUPPI models, discussed infra, are ""explicit"" that one should use firms' 
variable, not fixed, costs to implement the models. Trial Tr. at 3092:23-3093:15 (Hill). This is because the models assume that 
publishers ask whether the marginal profits of acquiring one more book exceed the marginal costs. See id. "
1469,31," This was before Penguin Books and Random House merged, so there was a ""Big Six"" instead of a ""Big Five."" "
1470,32," As previously discussed, there were six rounds of bidding between four bidders, with a high bid of $400,000 in the first round 
and a winning bid of $775,000 from PRH's Viking imprint, which was $75,000 more than Viking's initial bid clearance. See supra 
Section I.C."
1470,33," Other factors that courts have found relevant to an evaluation of the likelihood of coordinated effects include: differentiated 
products, transparent competitive outcomes, punishment mechanisms, and frequent purchases for small amounts. See H & R 
Block, 833 F. Supp. 2d at 77-79; CCC Holdings, 605 F. Supp. 2d at 62; Arch Coal, 329 F. Supp. 2d at 144-45 . The Court sees "
1471,," no need to march through a discussion of those factors. Merger analysis is industry-specific and fact-intensive. See Brown Shoe, 
370 U.S. at 321-22 (""Congress indicated plainly that a merger had to be functionally viewed, in the context of its particular 
industry."" (footnote omitted)). Where, as here, there is a strong risk of collusion based on history, current practices, and extreme 
market concentration, the Court finds it unnecessary to explore peripheral issues. "
1472,34," Although Dr. Hill combined the non-Big Five's market shares in his economic models as a reasonable simplification, see Trial 
Tr. at 3081:12-23 (Hill), he did not treat them as one competitor in his overall analysis. "
1473,35," Summing the squares of each firm's market share, the first HHI is calculated as 100 x 12= 100, and the second HHI is 
calculated as 2 x 502 = 5000. See supra Section III.A.2. "
1474,36," Defendants admitted in their closing argument that self-publishing was not a true option for authors. See Trial Tr. at 3272:17-
25 (arguing that hypothetical monopsonist test is ""utterly meaningless other than addressing whether there's an outside option in 
the form of self-publishing, which nobody was arguing in this case""). In their post-trial briefing, however, they surprisingly assert 
that self-publishing is a competitive threat. "
1475,37," BookTok refers to activity on the social media platform TikTok where users review and promote books to one another. See 
Trial Tr. at 1414:12-16 (Weisberg). "
1481,1," Plaintiffs assert tying claims under sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, and under section 3 of the Clayton Act. Google 
asserts, and Plaintiffs do not dispute, that if Plaintiffs fails to meet the requirements under section 1, Plaintiffs claims under the 
other statutes fail. See Mozart Co v. Mercedes-Benz of N. Am., Inc., 833 F.2d 1342, 1352 (9th Cir. 1987) (noting that the 
elements for establishing a Sherman Act Section 1 claim and a Clayton Act Section 3 claim are virtually the same); Data Gen. 
Corp. v. Grumman Sys. Support Corp., 36 F.3d 1147, 1182 n. 61 (1st Cir. 1994). "
1482,2," Plaintiffs also allege that Google unilaterally adds on its other API services and charges the customer for them. (Compl. ¶¶ 14, 
164.) Because Plaintiffs fail to allege facts to support this conclusory allegation and because none of the named Plaintiffs allege 
that they experienced this ""unilateral"" add-on, this allegation is insufficient to support a tying claim. Plaintiffs also allege that 
Google engaged in tying through its search and Google Cloud Platform products. (See id. ¶ 266.) This conclusory allegation 
lacking factual support cannot support a tying claim. "
1483,3," Plaintiffs also allege that ""[t]here are additional relevant markets salient for this case"" including ""the market for internet search 
and the market for cloud computing."" (Compl. ¶ 77.) The complaint lacks allegations to support these proposed markets. "
1484,4," The complaint also alleges that Google has a market share of 80% or more in the relevant product markets, relying on a U.S 
House Report that referred to the ""navigation app market."" (See Compl. ¶ 122.) In their opposition, Plaintiffs do not respond to 
Google's arguments challenging this allegation, and in failing to do so they concede these points. See Ramirez v. Ghilotti Bros. 
Inc., 941 F. Supp. 2d 1197, 1210 & n.7 (N.D. Cal. 2013) (collecting cases holding that failure to respond to an argument in an 
opposition brief may constitute a concession of the argument)."
1484,5," Plaintiffs represent that they do not intend to challenge the Waze acquisition, and thus, the Court will not address arguments 
related to the merits or timeliness of any such claim. "
1489,1," Crum & Forster is not itself a Defendant, but is an underwriting company partially comprised of Defendants United States Fire & 
Casualty Company (""U.S. Fire""), North River Insurance Company (""North River""), and Seneca Insurance Company (""Seneca""). 
See TCAC ¶ 28. "
1491,2, SAA was the previous name of SFAA. TCAC ¶ 117-18. 
1495,3," To the extent that Plaintiffs liken Local Rule 7-9 to the law of the case doctrine to argue that this doctrine, too, should preclude 
Plaintiffs from reasserting immunity under the Noerr-Pennington doctrine, ECF No. 305 at 25, the Court disagrees. ""Application 
of the [law of the case doctrine] is discretionary,"" United States v. Lummi Indian Tribe, 235 F.3d 443, 453 (9th Cir. 2000), and a 
court may depart from the law of the case where ""changed circumstances exist,"" United States v. Alexander, 106 F.3d 874 (9th 
Cir. 1997). Here, Plaintiffs claims partially rest on new factual allegations such that the TCAC presents an altered narrative from 
that of the CAC. The Court thus finds it necessary to revisit the question of the applicability of the defense to Plaintiffs' claims as 
presented in the TCAC. "
1496,4," In reply, Defendants rely on the Court's decision in Bay Area Surgical Mgmt. LLC v. Aetna Life Ins. Co., 2016 WL 3880989, at 
*9 (N.D. Cal. Jul. 18, 2016) for the proposition that ""what Plaintiffs overlook is that Clipper Ex[x]press [*32]  applies where an 
antitrust conspiracy has already been established, but does not provide Noerr activity can establish an antitrust conspiracy in the 
first instance."" ECF No. 310 at 18. In contrast with Bay Area, however, the Court has twice held that Plaintiffs plausibly alleged 
the existence of an antitrust conspiracy. ECF No. 91 at 23; ECF No. 159 at 24."
1496,5," Because the Cartwright Act was modeled after the Sherman Act, the Court's analysis addresses both statutes together under 
federal antitrust law. See, e.g., County of Tuolumne v. Sonora Cmty. Hosp., 236 F.3d 1148, 1160 (9th Cir. 2001). "
1497,6," Defendants also request that the Court take judicial notice of the pricing reports and financial statements of various 
Defendants. ECF No. 283. Plaintiffs do not oppose this request. ECF No. 305 at 13 n.1. The Court grants judicial notice of the 
existence of these documents, but not for the truth or accuracy of the statements therein. See Lee v. City of Los Angeles, 250 
F.3d 668, 689-90 (9th Cir. 2001). While the Court ""can consider the existence of the [documents] identified by [Defendants],"" the 
Court ""may not, on the basis of these reports, draw inferences or take notice of facts that might reasonably be disputed."" United 
States v. Corinthian Colleges, 655 F.3d 984, 999 (9th Cir. 2011). Defendants contend that because this information is publicly 
available, Defendants' alleged exchange of that information in the trade association setting cannot possibly have been 
conspiratorial. ECF No. 284 at 20-21. But this is precisely the type of inference that might be reasonably disputed that the Court 
is expressly prohibited from making. Corinthian Colleges, 655 at 999. ""[W]hile [Defendants'] assertions with respect to the 
[documents] . . . may ultimately prove true, [the Court] will not decide these specific factual matters at this stage."" Id. The Court 
does not rely on the contents of these documents in resolving the motion to dismiss. "
1500,7," IFIC lowered its premium rates across all lines of insurance as required by CDI, TCAC ¶ 187, but otherwise maintained a 
consistent 10% rate for the duration of the period, id. ¶ 7. "

on a motion to dismiss. "
1509,1," On August 25, 2022, this case was reassigned to the undersigned. ECF No. 584. "

1548,1," Defendants previously amended their answer on September 13, 2022, forty days after defendants filed the original answer; 
therefore, defendants do not have the right to amend their pleading as a matter of course within twenty-one days of service of a 
motion under Rule 12(f). Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(1). Nevertheless, the court reminds defendants that under the Federal Rules of 
Civil Procedure Rule 15(a)(2), ""a party may amend its pleading only with the opposing party's written consent or the court's "
1549,," leave."" Defendants plead new facts and arguments in their response in opposition to the motion to strike brought under Rule 
12(f), without seeking to amend their answer to meet the applicable pleading standard. "
1550,2," Defendants fail to note under which antitrust law the restraint of trade allegation is brought under, so the court assumes it is 
brought pursuant to the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1. "

1552,4," Specifically, the defendants in that case asserted the affirmative defenses of unclean hands, estoppel, and waiver using the 
following language: Plaintiff is precluded from any recovery in this Complaint by reason of the unclean hands of Doosan Infracore America

859 F. Supp. 1521, 1535 (S.D.N.Y. 1994) (""While the representations need not be made in a 'classic advertising campaign,' but 
may consist instead of more informal types of 'promotion,' the representations . . . must be disseminated sufficiently to the 
relevant purchasing public to constitute 'advertising' or 'promotion' within that industry.""). The Court disagrees. The Press 
Release constitutes the kind of commercial promotion governed by the Lanham Act. "
1569,3," The parties further disagree about whether the false information was published ""with malice."" A defendant acts with malice 
""only if he knew of the falsity or acted with reckless disregard concerning it, or if he acted with ill will or intended to interfere in 
the economic interest of the plaintiff in an unprivileged fashion."" Kinetic Concepts, Inc. v. Bluesky Med. Corp., No. SA-03-CA-

however, accepting the allegations in the SAC as true, the Lynd Defendants ""knew of the falsity"" of the information they 
submitted to ANMAT on Plaintiff's behalf. Accordingly, Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged the ""malice"" element of its business 
disparagement claim. "

1651,7," The Court is aware that Defendants have submitted a Daubert Motion challenging the admissibility of Dr. Williams's expert 
report. See ECF No. [157]. At this juncture, however, the Court need not decide the Daubert issue since, even assuming the 
admissibility of Plaintiff's expert, class certification is due to be denied. See Bouton v. Ocean Properties, Ltd, 322 F.R.D. 683, 
697, n.9 (S.D. Fla. 2017) "
1652,8," Plaintiff also argues that ""individualized damages calculations are insufficient to foreclose ... certification"" ECF No. [161] at 3 
(quoting Carriuolo v. Gen. Motors Co., 823 F.3d 977 (11th Cir. 2016)). The Court certainly notes binding authority dictating that 
where there is a core liability question common to each class member, the need for individualized damage calculations does not 
necessarily preclude class certification. Here, however, the Court finds that there are individualized questions of liability 
precluding certification."
1652,9," The Court notes that outside of Antitrust law, it identified one case where the court certified a class where defendants 
allegedly engaged in captive-supply agreements to affect fed-cattle prices, in violation of the Packers and Stockyard Act. Pickett 
v. IBP, Inc., CIV. 96-A-1103-N, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22453, 2001 WL 34886460 (M.D. Ala. Dec. 26, 2001). However, that 
claim is similar to an Antitrust action since it deals with the violation of a statute intended to prevent market-affecting schemes. "
1676,1," Notably, in other recent prosecutions brought under similar factual circumstances, courts have similarly found that no hire and 
no solicitation agreements can be plead as a tool or method used to allocate the labor market such that the per se rule applies. 
See DaVita, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16188, 2022 WL 266759, at *5-7; United States v. Manahe, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 140154, 
2022 WL 3161781, at *6-10."
1676,2," Notably, the court focused its discussion on determining if the alleged agreement was a group boycott. Bogan, 166 F.3d at 515. 
The court found that the agreement was ""clearly not a territorial or customer allocation"" and that it could not be a ""supplier 
allocation"" because ""the [a]greement permits transfers, and experienced . . . agents do not comprise the entire set of suppliers of 
their services."" Id. Ultimately, while the agreement ""constrain[ed] [agents] to some degree, it [did] not allocate the market . . . to 
any meaningful extent."" Id. The court did not explicitly consider the agreement as allocating the labor market. "
1681,3," It is not clear whether a naked horizontal restraint would not be per se illegal simply because the restraint was intrabrand rather 
than interbrand. The Supreme Court has held that an intrabrand horizontal agreement among General Motors dealers that they 
would not do business with discounters was per se illegal. United States v. General Motors Corp., 384 U.S. 127, 144-45, 86 S. 
Ct. 1321, 16 L. Ed. 2d 415 (1966). Additionally, Justice Stevens in his Business Electronics Corp. dissent was more categorical 
about the distinction in stating that ""[t]here is no doubt that horizontal intrabrand price fixing is per se illegal, even if the 
conspirators lack the market power to affect interbrand competition in a manner that would violate the rule of reason."" 485 U.S. 
at 744 n.7 (Stevens, J. dissenting). This Court has not, however, identified a case in which a Supreme Court majority has 
categorically addressed the interbrand and intrabrand distinction in a horizonal restraint. Notably, lower courts continue to split 
on the issue of whether a horizontal intrabrand restraint is subject to the per se rule. Compare Bogan, 166 F.3d at 515-16 
(applying the rule of reason), with Toledo Mack Sales & Serv., Inc. v. Mack Trucks, Inc., 530 F.3d 204, 220-21 (3d Cir. 2008) 
(applying per se rule). Ultimately, this issue is not dispositive because the Indictment pleads an interbrand restraint. "
1682,4," To the extent Defendants argue that engineering services and engineers are essentially synonymous, this is not apparent from 
the face of the Indictment. See Reply at 25-26. If there are additional facts that would illuminate the vertical nature of the alleged 
restraint, such arguments are better suited for a later stage of the proceedings. See Sampson, 898 F.3d at 279 (""[W]hen such a 
defense raises dispositive 'evidentiary questions,' a district court must defer resolving those questions until trial.""). "
1683,5," In light of the above, Defendants' argument that the no poach agreement between Company A and Company B should be 
subject to a different analysis fails for the same reasons. "
1685,6," The Court discussed the parties' arguments at length in its prior ruling and therefore, will not repeat them here. See Order at

1690,3, We need not and do not decide which test applies.
1690,4," Absent other evidence, Dreamstime's assertion that the algorithmic revision caused it harm boils down to post hoc ergo propter 
hoc, a common logical fallacy that states that if event x followed event y, then y must have been caused by x. Here, because 
expert opinions were conflicted, as set forth in the accompanying published opinion, the record does not unequivocally disclose 
whether Google's revision of its algorithms in fact was the cause of declines in search ranking. "

1710,1," The Court notes that in LegitScript's motion to stay, LegitScript stated that it ""submits this memorandum of law in support of its 
motion to dismiss . . . ."" ECF 252 at 2 (emphasis added). The Court, however, has already denied Defendant's motion to 
dismiss. ECF 244. Thus, the Court treats Defendant's pending motion as a motion to stay. "
1711,2," It is premature for this Court to order a stay on the grounds that collateral estoppel, or issue preclusion, might apply. The 
parties have not yet fully briefed collateral estoppel, and there are several factors in the collateral estoppel analysis that have not 
yet occurred. See Clark v. Bear Stearns & Co., 966 F.2d 1318, 1320 (9th Cir. 1992) (""To foreclose relitigation of an issue under 
collateral estoppel: (1) the issue at stake must be identical to the one alleged in the prior litigation; (2) the issue must have been 
actually litigated in the prior litigation; and (3) the determination of the issue in the prior litigation must have been a critical and 
necessary part of the judgment in the earlier action.""). There is no motion with similar issues now pending before this Court, and 
the issue in the New York Lawsuit has not yet been fully litigated or decided. "
1717,*," Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation. "
1718,1," In November 2018, Mi Salud was rebranded as Vital and abandoned the regional model. See Vázquez-Ramos v. Triple-S 
Salud, Inc., Civ. No.: 19-1527, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 250159, 2020 WL 8513843, at *1 n.1 (D.P.R. Dec. 15, 2020). "
1719,2," Urologics contends that ASES -- as the agency empowered to hear and resolve grievances over administration of the Mi Salud 
program -- has exclusive primary jurisdiction to resolve plaintiffs' claims as to the quality of urology services provided to Mi Salud 
patients. We have explained previously that ""the primary jurisdiction doctrine has little to do"" with federal antitrust cases ""and it 
certainly does not go to the subject matter jurisdiction of the federal court."" Arroyo-Melecio, 398 F.3d at 73; see also P.R. Mar. 
Shipping Auth. v. Fed. Mar. Comm'n, 75 F.3d 63, 67 (1st Cir. 1996). In any event, issues of patient care play no dispositive 
role in our decision concerning the sufficiency of plaintiffs' pleading."
1719,3," HN4[
] Section 4 establishes that ""any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue therefor . . . and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained."" 15 U.S.C. § 15(a). And 
section 16 provides that ""[a]ny person, firm, corporation, or association shall be entitled to sue for and have injunctive relief . . . 
against threatened loss or damage by a violation of the antitrust laws."" Id. § 26. "
1720,4," Although plaintiffs bring independent claims under section 1 and section 2 of the Sherman Act, each of the alleged exclusive 
dealing arrangements provides the foundation of both corresponding claims. Accordingly, whether plaintiffs adequately alleged 
antitrust standing as to each claim depends on the same analysis. We therefore address them together. "
1725,5," The clause reads: ""any obligation that arises from the contract of a participating provider . . . [will] also be applicable to this 
agreement"" (emphasis supplied). "
1726,6," Even as to this different, wider market, plaintiffs' allegation is the equivalent of saying that there are an uncertain number of 
potential purchasers in the market, with some unknown number being among the largest, and MMM is just one of those. "
1743,1," Under certain circumstances, a court ruling on a motion to dismiss may independently assess whether works are not 
substantially similar. See Christianson v. West Pub. Co., 149 F.2d 202, 203 (9th Cir. 1945) (""There is ample authority for holding 
that when the copyrighted work and the alleged infringement are both before the court, capable of examination and comparison, 
non-infringement can be determined on a motion to dismiss.""). Here, however, the Court cannot properly examine and compare 
the works to determine non-infringement. Plaintiffs have provided three examples broadly describing how Defendants' 
""choreography movement, sequences, and routines are substantially similar"" to those depicted in Plaintiffs' copyrighted works. 
FAC ¶ 48. But Plaintiffs did not submit the referenced videos with their FAC. See generally FAC. Moreover, Plaintiffs state that 
""[b]ecause Defendants' videos are published behind a paywall,"" Plaintiffs are ""unable to review and compare every one of 
Defendants' videos"" with their own, and therefore, ""the full extent of Defendants' infringement . . . cannot be assessed until 
Defendants produce the videos to Plaintiffs in discovery."" Id. ¶ 49. Consequently, the Court is unable to determine non-
infringement at this stage of litigation. "
1751,1," Trang originally brought this case as a qui tam action, but the United States of America was dismissed, and Trang now 
proceeds on his individual claims against the Bank and Sullivan. See ECF Nos. 1; 16; 22; 23. "
1753,2," I take no position on whether Trang's qui claims were objectively baseless or whether he had an improper motive in bringing 
those claims. I decide only that Bank of George has plausibly pleaded those facts. "
1755,3," Trang also argues these claims are not pleaded with particularity under the heightened pleading standards for fraud claims. 
See Fed. R. Civ. P. 9. I need not address this argument because the claims are untimely. "
1759,1," The Court finds that the facts and legal arguments set forth in Defendants' motions are similar enough to warrant resolution in a 
single order. The Court will note if and where the parties' arguments differ."
1759,2," The facts discussed below are taken from the parties' briefs and exhibits, without further quotation or attribution unless 
otherwise noted."
1759,3," HomeServices of America, Inc. (""HSoA"") is a holding company and subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company. HSoA 
holds HSF Affiliates, LLC (""HSF""), which owns BHH Affiliates, LLC (""BHH""). HSoA owns three brokerages within Missouri: 
ReeceNichols, BHHS Kansas City, and BHHS Alliance Real Estate. BHH operates the Berkshire Hathaway Home Services 
(""BHHS""), and previously operated the Real Living network. Robert Moline (""Moline""), President and Chief Operating Officer of 
HSoA from 2008-2017, testified that franchises associated with HSF and BHHS were considered ""wholly-owned"" subsidiaries of 
HSoA. (Doc. #963-46, p. 8.) HSF is an entity that oversees both independent and branded franchises. BHH has eight 
franchisees operating in Missouri; two are owned by HSoA and six are independently owned."
1759,4," Realogy owns and operates a subsidiary, NRT Missouri LLC d/b/a Coldwell Banker Gundaker, which is a real estate brokerage 
that operates within the Subject MLS. On June 9, 2022, Realogy rebranded and is now known as Anywhere Real Estate Inc.; 
but, for the purposes of this motion, the Court will refer to it as Realogy. "
1760,5," Plaintiffs produced Keller Williams's ""Policies and Guidelines Manual,"" revised on April 1, 2020, which requires its brokers to 
""become members of their local Board/Association of REALTORS® and MLS except when exempted by their TL, and will keep 
their membership current and active at all times."" (Doc. #963-23, p. 8.)"
1760,6," Plaintiffs produced a ""Franchise Disclosure Document"" issued by Re/Max in 2014 that states: ""You agree that you and each of 
your Sales Associates will join and remain a member in good standing and comply with the by-laws and rules and regulations of "
1761,," a local Board of REALTORS® (or comparable organization[.]"" (Doc. #963-98, p. 3.) Plaintiffs also produced a brokerage 
agreement requiring brokers to ""maintain membership . . . with the National Association of REALTORS® (""NAR"") . . . [and] abide 
by the Code of Ethics promulgated by NAR and all of the rules and regulations of NAR and each local or regional MLS in which 
Broker participates."" (Doc. #963-99, p. 4.)"
1761,7," HomeServices's Code of Business Conduct, published in 2013, stated: You are encouraged to belong to trade associations when such groups contribute significant benefits sufficient to justify the 
time and cost of membership or support. By their nature, trade [*8]  associations involve meetings and discussions with 
competitors and care must be taken to avoid antitrust problems. You must obtain permission from a corporate officer before 
joining a trade association and before you appear at any meeting as a speaker or a member of a panel where statements 
will be made on behalf of the company. (Doc. #963-111, p. 34.) The Court finds that Plaintiffs have produced evidence creating a genuine dispute of material fact as to 
whether HSoA required its franchisees and affiliated agents to be members of NAR. "
1763,8," See Mo. Rev. Stat. § 416.141 (stating the Missouri Antitrust Law ""shall be construed in harmony with ruling judicial 
interpretations of comparable federal antitrust statutes""); see also Missouri v. National Organization for Women, Inc., 620 F.2d 
1301, 1316 (8th Cir. 1980) (holding that ""the Missouri antitrust law . . . can be disposed of with the same rationale with which 
we have disposed of the Sherman Act claim"") (citing Mo. Rev. Stat. § 416.141). "
1764,9," Because the Court finds a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether Plaintiffs were direct purchasers of the Buyer-Broker's 
services, the Court need not address Plaintiffs' arguments regarding the exception to Illinois Brick set out by Freeman v. San 
Diego Ass'n of Realtors, 322 F.3d 1133 (9th Cir. 2003). Regardless, even if the Seller-Brokers are considered the direct 
purchasers, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have standing because there is no realistic possibility the Seller-Brokers would sue 
Defendants over the alleged antitrust violation. Freeman, 322 F.3d at 1145-46 (citing Royal Printing Co v. Kimberly-Clark Corp., 
621 F.2d 323, 326 (9th Cir. 1980)). "
1765,10," Further, as the Court finds that Plaintiffs have presented evidence creating a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether 
Defendants conspired to restrain trade in the adoption and enforcement of Section 2-G-1, the Court need not address NAR and 
the HomeServices Defendants arguments that they cannot conspire with only themselves."
1765,11," The HomeServices Defendants and Realogy admit they require associated brokers to follow NAR's Code of Ethics, but argue 
that NAR's Code of Ethics does not require compliance with Section 2-G-1. However, a reasonable jury could find to the 
contrary. NAR's Code of Ethics Standard of Practice 16-15 states: ""In cooperative transactions REALTORS® shall compensate 
cooperating REALTORS®[.]"" (Doc. #963-11, p. 8.)"
1765,12," NAR's Code of Ethics Standard of Practice 3-2 states ""After a REALTOR® has submitted an offer to purchase or lease 
property, the listing broker may not attempt to unilaterally modify the offered compensation with respect to that cooperative 
transaction."" (Doc. #963-11, p. 4.) "
1766,13," The HomeServices Defendants argue that HSoA cannot be liable for the actions of BHH. (Doc. #986, p. 9.) The Court finds 
that Plaintiffs have presented sufficient evidence to create a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether all of the 
HomeServices Defendants engaged in the conspiracy discussed herein such that HSoA's liability is not derivative of BHH. However, for the reasons discussed below, the Court also finds that Plaintiffs have presented sufficient evidence to create a 
genuine dispute of material fact as to whether the HomeServices Defendants are independently managed and have 
consolidated decision-making power, or entities capable of conspiring under § 1 of the Sherman Act. See American Needle, Inc. 
v. Nat'l Football League, 560 U.S. 183, 196-97, 130 S. Ct. 2201, 176 L. Ed. 2d 947 (2010) (holding the determinative ""question is 
whether the agreement joins together 'independent centers of decisionmaking'"" and finding entities were not capable of 
conspiring for § 1 purposes where they were each ""a substantial, independently owned, and independently managed business""). 
For example, Robert Moline served as CEO of HSoA at some point from 2008 to 2017, and ""[s]omewhere towards the end"" was 
""given the title of CEO of HomeServices Residential Real Estate Brokerage or whatever, which is a nonexistent entity;"" however, 
these titles ""didn't matter"" because, regardless of his position, he ""kept doing the same things [he] was doing before."" (Doc. 
#936-46, p. 3.) When asked if HSoA's subsidiaries and franchisees competed with one another, Moline responded, ""[H]ow do 
you compete with yourself?"" (Doc. #963-46, p. 7.)"
1766,14," As the Court finds Plaintiffs have created a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether Plaintiffs have produced direct 
evidence of a conspiracy among the Defendants, the Court need not address Defendants' arguments relating to circumstantial "
1767,," evidence of a conspiracy. See Robertson, 679 F.3d at 289-90. Regardless, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have produced 
sufficient circumstantial evidence of a conspiracy among the Defendants such that the outcome would be the same. "
1768,15," As the Court finds that the per se standard is applicable, the Court need not address the Parties' arguments regarding the rule 
of reason and whether the relevant market is a two-sided platform, as discussed in Ohio v. American Express Co., 138 S. Ct. 
2274, 201 L. Ed. 2d 678 (2018). However, even if the rule of reason was applicable, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have produced 
evidence about the relevant market and effect of Section 2-G-1 that creates a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether 
Section 2-G-1 is an unreasonable restraint of trade. "
1769,16," In a companion Order, the Court denies Defendants' Daubert motion to exclude Dr. Schulman from testifying at trial."
1769,17," Defendants argue that Count II is derivative of and dependent on Plaintiffs' antitrust claims. The Court rejects this argument for 
the same reason it declines to grant summary judgment, as discussed above. "
1774,1," To support this argument, Defendant attaches as exhibits to its motion several documents related to its rate filings with the DOI. 
Dkt. Nos. 34-2, 34-3, 34-4, 34-5. Defendant does not expressly request that the Court take judicial notice of the exhibits, but it 
cites case law suggestive of such a request. See, e.g., Roussin v. AARP, Inc., 664 F. Supp. 2d 412, 416 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (taking 
judicial notice that insurance rate was approved by New York authority). Plaintiffs neither object to the exhibits nor dispute the 
facts contained therein. Because the exhibits do not alter the Court's analysis, it is unnecessary to decide whether they are 
properly subject to judicial notice. "
1775,2," Subsequent California appellate authority also appears to be in tension with the suggestion that MacKay established an 
independent common law filed rate doctrine. See BullsEye Telecom, Inc. v. California Pub. Utilities Com., 66 Cal. App. 5th 301, 
333, 281 Cal. Rptr. 3d 127 (2021) (rejecting argument invoking ""the 'filed rate doctrine'"" because the petitioners ""rel[ied] on 
cases applying federal law and fail[ed] to show the doctrine applies under California law""). "
