Opinion  The orders to the helmsman were clear enough.  'The Court should avoid creating by implication inharmony between different  parts of the same opinion which are capable of reconciliation.' (Union Leader's brief in No. 5620.)

 A shopper, also known as a throwaway, is a newspaper containing principally advertising which is distributed free, and without  request, at doorways.  In Massachusetts, Boston and Lynn are the only cities with more than one paper (excluding morning and evening by the same  publisher).  This phenomenon, of course, is not restricted to Massachusetts.  See  Times-Picayune Publishing Co. v. United  States, 1953, 345 U.S. 594, 602-603  and note 13,  73 S.Ct. 872, 97 L.Ed. 1277 .  An interesting speculation might be whether the antitrust laws were intended to protect one natural monopolist against  another, in view of the fact that there was no competition before the battle began and there would be none afterwards.  Both  parties flirt with this thought when the purpose serves.  Since these laws are concerned primarily with the public interest,  Associated Press v. United States, 1945, 326 U.S. 1, 17 , note 16,  65 S.Ct. 1416, 89 L.Ed. 2013 , rehearing denied  326 U.S. 802,  66 S.Ct. 6, 90 L.Ed. 489 ;  International Shoe Co. v. F.T.C., 1930, 280 U.S. 291, 298, 50 S.Ct. 89, 74 L.Ed. 431 , it may be that  they would not be involved if, for instance, the product provided by either party would be the same.  However, we cannot say  that it could not be in the public interest to have one newspaper rather than another.  Where there is no identity of performance  we will not say that the public does not have an interest in competition even though that competition be an elimination bout.  We agree with the court that the use of financial resources alone was not such an exercise of the Manchester 'monopoly  power' in Haverhill as would imply an intent by Union Leader Wrongfully to exclude its competitor. Cf.   United States v. Griffith,  supra, 334 U.S. at pages 107-109, 68 S.Ct. at pages 945-946 . By the same token Union Leader's criticism of NNE's financial  strength is ill-founded.  It is true that after the Journal became a daily these practices were discontinued.  But it must have already become apparent  that the Journal was in the union's picket line.  Union Leader's present position may be illustrated by its argument that the  shopper which was absorbing Gazette's advertising 'was not in the same market with the Gazette.' Almost as strained are its  

--- 頁碼 19 ---
contentions based on testimony that it is economically justifiable to advertise in only one of two competing papers.  This  testimony fell far short of suggesting the reverse, that it was economically unjustifiable to advertise in both.  We expressly disclaim any approval of the court's citation of  Allen Bradley Co. v. Local No. 3, International Brotherhood of  Electrical Workers, 1945, 325 U.S. 797, 65 S.Ct. 1533, 89 L.Ed. 1939 , rehearing denied  326 U.S. 803, 66 S.Ct. 11, 90 L.Ed.  489 . We are not required to decide whether the union violated the  antitrust law , and so need not consider the very difficult  problem of where labor's immunity to antitrust prosecution ceases.  The court expressly found that Union Leader did not come into Haverhill originally at the union's request.  Therefore, it might  be questionable whether the joint appearance of union and Union Leader representatives put any pressure on an advertiser to  use only the Journal beyond that which already existed from the mere coincidental facts that the Gazette was being struck and  the Journal provided alternative newspaper advertising on a roughly equivalent basis.  But even if in fact it added no pressure,  this would not undermine the court's finding that such pressure was wrongfully intended.  Union Leader describes these merchants as 'honor-bound to support it,' and states that it was 'prudent * * * to engage outside  help' and that obtaining 'local advice * * * is so normal and much practiced in so many businesses that it has become a standard  business technique.' Seemingly, the contention is that the court's finding that Loeb was paying for something more than proper  advice was plainly wrong.  We have no inclination to agree.  The case comes before us after trial on all issues except damages.  The court accordingly made no finding as to what portion  of this loss would have resulted simply from the strike without the competition to which this opinion is addressed.  We have no  doubt that both contributed.

 We have examined the court's opinion in the light of the conflicting analyses made by the parties and agree with Gazette that  the word 'compels' as used by the court indicated a ruling of law and not a finding or conclusion of fact.  On remand for trial, held, for plaintiff, D.C.D.N.Mex. (unreported), reversed  Mead's Fine Bread Co. v. Moore, 10 Cir., 1954,  208 F.2d 777 , reversed and district court affirmed 1954,  348 U.S. 115, 75 S.Ct. 148, 99 L.Ed. 145 , rehearing denied  348 U.S.  932, 75 S.Ct. 334, 99 L.Ed. 731 .  Nothing in the subsequent history of the Moore case, see note 12 supra, suggests Supreme Court disapproval of this.

 The case for Gazette here seems in some respects stronger than the one considered by Judge Phillips.  There the defendant  was called upon to justify conduct which the statute expressly prohibited.   15 U.S.C.A. 13 . In the present case the defendant  merely has to rebut an inference of a wrongful intention drawn from particular actions.  Or, as Union Leader itself states in its brief with reference to this period, 'Gazette's financial condition was such that it could  not continue much longer.'  The practical necessity of Gazette's adjusting rates in order to maintain its position is made plain by Loeb's own testimony.   He stated that 'this matter of the rates * * * goes to the very heart of any newspaper's survival.' Elsewhere he testified that a  serious consequence of secret discriminatory advertising practices --  once it is known that they are indulged in --  is that it  enables an unscrupulous advertiser to play one paper against the other.  A merchant who has not been offered a special rate- cut by one paper can nonetheless tell the other that he has been, and that other, knowing the first paper does do such things,  fears to disbelieve him, and must match the price in order not to lose the customer.  It is not clear whether the purpose of this finding was to bring NNE within the investment exception of  section 7 , infra note 18,  but we think the previously quoted finding would preclude this.

 The date mentioned is the date of a release and license granted to Ford Motor Co. by C.T.R.'s assignor.  It may be that under  that document the critical date is December 31, 1955.  See  Birdsell v.

Winters, 280 U.S. 30, 50  S.Ct. 9, 74 L.Ed. 147 (1929)  (infringement by both the manufacturer (Dent Hardware Co.) and user (Sanitary Refrigerator Co.) of  the patented product); and see  General Talking Pictures Corp. v. Western Electric Co., 305 U.S. 124, 127, 59 S.Ct. 116, 117, 83  L.Ed. 81 (1938) , where it is said: 'Pictures Corporation * * * is in no better position than if it had manufactured the amplifiers itself  without a license. It is liable because it has used the invention without license to do so.'  On the necessity for an implied license to repair, see  Thomson-Houston Electric Co. v.

 ' HN3 [ ] (c) Whoever sells a component of a patented machine, manufacture, combination or composition, or a material or  apparatus for use in practicing a patented process, constituting a material part of the invention, knowing the same to be  especially made or especially adapted for use in an infringement of such patent, and not a staple article, or commodity of  commerce suitable for substantial non-infringing use, shall be liable as a contributory infringer.'  In further support of the view that the attention of the members of the Court was concentrated on the situation with respect to  licensed General Motors cars, we note that apart from Mr. Justice Brennan's express reference to a distinction between Ford  and General Motors top replacements there are indications in the opinion of the Court that the licensed-unlicensed distinction  was recognized and only the licensed situation considered.  Among these 'clues' in Mr. Justice Whittaker's opinion are his  statement  365 U.S. at p. 344, 81 S.Ct. at p. 603, 5 L.Ed.2d 592  that the patent licensee's, C.T.R.'s, contention would involve a  'new license' and 'another royalty' and his conclusion  365 U.S. at p. 345, 81 S.Ct. at p. 604, 5 L.Ed.2d 592  'that a license to use  a patented combination includes the right' to repair. In his concurring opinion, Mr. Justice Black must have had the licensed  situation in mind in asserting, at  365 U.S. at p. 360, 81 S.Ct. at p. 612, 5 L.Ed.2d 592 , that 'one royalty to one patentee for one  sale is enough * * *.' And Mr. Justice Harlan, in his dissenting opinion, states  365 U.S. at p. 369, 81 S.Ct. at p. 616, 5 L.Ed.2d  592 , 'The underlying rationale of the rule is of course that the owner's license to use the device carries with it an implied license  to keep it fit for the use for which it was intended.'  The Supreme Court in a footnote 365 U.S. at page 344,  81 S.Ct. at p. 603, 5 L.Ed.2d 592  of its opinion said that the doctrine of  patent misuse was 'not an issue in this case.'

 Plaintiff also contends that these matters are relevant as essential 'background' evidence of conditions within the shoe  industry prior to the commencement of the limitations period.  Section 5 states in pertinent part: '(a) A final judgment or decree heretofore or hereafter rendered in any civil or criminal proceeding brought by or on behalf of the  United States under the anti-trust laws to the effect that a defendant has violated said laws shall be prima facie evidence against  such defendant in any action or proceeding brought by any other party against such defendant under said laws or by the United  States under section 15a of this title, as to all matters respecting which said judgment or decree would be an estoppel as  between the parties thereto: Provided, That this section shall not apply to consent judgments or decrees entered before any  testimony has been taken or to judgments or decrees entered in actions under section 15a of this title.'

Opinion These agreements ran automatically from year to year but were subject to termination in any year on notice of either party. There is no allegation that defendant renewed its request for this price increase at this or any later time. That he did not order; that defendant did not require his competitors to take and which under his contract plaintiff was not  obliged to accept. Plaintiff contends that defendant's above stated tactics also violated the Clayton Act as amended by the Robinson-Patman  Price Discrimination Act,  15 U.S.C. § 13(a)(b)(f)  but this act is inapplicable under any view of the facts and for that reason we  shall not consider this contention. In this case the Court stated that both minimum and maximum price fixing agreements "cripple the freedom of traders and  thereby restrain their ability to sell in accordance with their own judgment."

Section 1  reads in relevant part "Every contract, combination or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the  several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal. . . ." 26 Stat. 209,  15 U.S.C. § 1 (1964 ed.) . A simple refusal to deal, standing alone, is not a vertical agreement; in fact the refusal indicates there has been a failure to  obtain agreement.  Turner, The Definition of Agreement Under the Sherman Act: Conscious Parallelism and Refusals to Deal,  75 Harv. L. Rev. 655, 686 (1962). 

--- 頁碼 49 ---
Concur We do not subscribe to the view that an agreement broken shortly after it was made is in effect no agreement at all.  See  Guidry v. Continental Oil Company, 350 F.2d 342, 344 (5th Cir. 1965) , where the same court, on the same day it decided  Broussard, strongly emphasized this point. To be sure,  United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 1940, 310 U.S. 150, 223, 84 L. Ed. 1129, 60 S. Ct. 811 , contains the  classic statement, often repeated, that "a combination formed for the purpose and with the effect of raising, depressing, fixing,  pegging, or stabilizing the price of a commodity in interstate or foreign commerce is illegal  per se ." But this was made in the  context of industry-wide policies.  As I shall hope to demonstrate, while maximum price fixing among manufacturers is more than  likely to restrain price competition, the same cannot be said of maximum price fixing by one manufacturer acting truly  independently.

I agree with my brethren that no such allegation can be found or inferred in Quinn's complaint, or should be supplied. Cf. the language of Learned Hand, writing for the Second Circuit in  United States v. Aluminum Co. of America, 1945, 148 F.2d  416, 427 . "[In outlawing monopolies, Congress] was not necessarily actuated by economic motives alone.  It is possible,  because of its indirect social or moral effect, to prefer a system of small producers, each dependent for his success upon his  own skill and character, to one in which the great mass of those engaged must accept the direction of a few.  These  considerations, which we have suggested only as possible purposes of the Act, we think the decisions prove to have been in fact  its purposes." Compare  Klor's, Inc. v. Broadway-Hale Stores, 1959, 359 U.S. 207, 3 L. Ed. 2d 741, 79 S. Ct. 705 . An interestingly comparable case is  Northern Pacific Ry. v. United States, 1958, 356 U.S. 1, 2 L. Ed. 2d 545, 78 S. Ct. 514 .  There the Court held that a vertical agreement between a railroad-landowner and a shipper-land purchaser, in which the  purchaser agreed, in partial consideration for the sale of land, to "prefer" Northern Pacific over other carriers, violated  section 1 .   Northern Pacific could not, the Court said, use one resource it possessed (land) to coerce its own customers in another market  (shipping) in order to obtain an advantage over the railroad's own competitors. Here it is alleged that Mobil is using its land  ownership to deprive one of its customers of price discretion, in order to gain an advantage over Mobil's own competitors

through low dealer margins.  The agreements in  Northern Pacific  affected discretion to choose shippers rather than discretion to  set prices, but the analogous structure of the two arrangements is suggestive. See generally Note, "Combinations" in Restraint of Trade: A New Approach to  Section 1  of the Sherman Act, 1966 Utah L. Rev.  75, 78-89. The note argues that  Simpson  does not fit within the traditional definition of conspiracy, and suggests that what  happened in  Simpson  should be described, and proscribed, as a vertical combination (but not conspiracy) in restraint of trade.

Opinion Theodore R. Hodgkins was the president of Forster Mfg. Co. at all times relevant to this litigation.  These two individually- named defendants will be treated as one and referred to as Forster throughout this opinion. See  n. 40,  infra . The Federal Trade Commission first issued a complaint against Forster on July 23, 1958.  The Commission hearing examiner  found that Forster had violated section 2(a) of the Clayton Act by its use of discriminatory pricing practices, which finding was  affirmed by the Commission.  Subsequently, we remanded the case for further proceedings before the Commission.   Forster  Mfg. Co. v. FTC, 335 F.2d 47 (1st Cir. 1964) , cert. denied,  380 U.S. 906, 13 L. Ed. 2d 794, 85 S. Ct. 887 (1965) . However, the  new order of the Commission, again finding that Forster had violated section 2(a) of the Clayton Act, was affirmed by us.   Forster  Mfg. Co. v. FTC, 361 F.2d 340 (1st Cir. 1966) , cert. denied,  385 U.S. 1003, 17 L. Ed. 2d 542, 87 S. Ct. 706 (1967) , reh'g denied,  387 U.S. 938, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1007, 87 S. Ct. 2047 (1967) .

Section 5(a), reproduced in part in n. 4,  supra , provides the private litigant with prima facie evidentiary assistance in certain  circumstances.

Federal Trade Commission Act, 38 Stat. 717 (1914), as amended,  15 U.S.C. § 41 et seq. (1964) .   See  Henderson, The Federal  Trade Commission, pp. 16-28 (1924). The court set forth six reasons why the Federal Trade Commission order before it could not be admitted pursuant to section  5(a).   First , the Commission's order lacked finality: "The result of the proceedings before the Commission is an order which has  no effect in itself, unless made operative by the Circuit Court of Appeals, which has power of review."  John Bene, supra at 730 .  Secondly , a Commission proceeding was not a "proceeding in equity" as the statute then required.   Thirdly , a Commission  proceeding was not brought by or on behalf of the United States.   Fourthly , the Commission order in that case was apparently  that the defendant had violated the Federal Trade Commission Act, which has never been considered an " antitrust law " as that  term is used in section 5(a).  Thus, the order was not "under the antitrust laws".   Fifthly , for the same reason, there was thus no  finding "to the effect" that the defendant had violated an " antitrust law ".   Finally , the order itself was only against John Bene &  Sons, Inc., but the plaintiff wanted to offer it against several additional defendants in the subsequent suit.  It should be noted at this point that while these six prerequisites to admissibility still exist with minor changes of wording, only the  first three are relevant to our case.  Here, the Commission order was "to the effect" that Forster had violated section 2(a) of the  Clayton Act (rather than the Federal Trade Commission Act as in  John Bene ) which is clearly an " antitrust law ".   15 U.S.C. §§  12  and  44 (1964) ;  Nashville Milk Co. v. Carnation Co., 355 U.S. 373, 2 L. Ed. 2d 340, 78 S. Ct. 352 (1958) . Moreover,  Farmington seeks to introduce the order only against those defendants named in the order.

Supp. 507 (D.N.J. 1963) . New Jersey Wood Finishing Co. v. Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing Co., 332 F.2d 346 (3rd Cir. 1964) . In argument before the Supreme Court, the positions of the parties and amici varied.  The petitioner (defendant in the district  court), while conceding in its brief that section 5(a) was not "directly involved", nevertheless endeavored to tie the two sections  together as the product of one dominant Congressional intent -- to deal with proceedings in court.  The respondent on certiorari  (plaintiff in the district court) never conceded that the two clauses were interdependent or in  pari materia .  Almost one fourth of  its brief on the issue of tolling was devoted to arguing that the two were not coextensive.  It then proceeded, arguendo, to  contend that section 5(a) applied to Commission orders.  The United States, as amicus, devoted a major part of its brief in  support of the Third Circuit decision to asserting the irrelevancy of section 5(a) in deciding the applicability of section 5(b).  It also  conceded for the purposes of the case that section 5(a) did not apply to Commission orders.  Private amici, contending with  each other in the Eighth Circuit, predictably took opposite tacks; one devoted 64 pages to trying to demonstrate equivalence  between sections 5(a) and (b), while the other asserted a lack of interdependence. The section 5(a) proviso specifically excepts "consent judgments or decrees entered before any testimony has been taken."  The Third Circuit opinion in  3  M, 332 F.2d 346, 349 , indicates that the Commission order against  3M  was such an order.

In a footnote, however, Forster contends that  in light of  FTC v. Jantzen, 386 U.S. 228, 18 L. Ed. 2d 11, 87 S. Ct. 998 (1967) , the Finality Act of 1959 would not apply to the  Commission order of July 23, 1965 which was admitted below, simply because the Commission proceeding was instituted prior  to the enactment of the Finality Act. We cannot agree.  Jantzen  involved a Commission order entered  prior  to the enactment of the Finality Act, not afterwards as in our case.  The  entire thrust of the Court's opinion is directed at pre-1959 orders.  The Court seemed to rely essentially on two reasons for its  

--- 頁碼 64 ---
holding that the Act did not apply to pre-1959 orders.  First, because of the heavy penalties which can be visited on the violator  of a final Commission order, Congress felt it unfair to use the Finality Act retroactively so as to finalize pre-existing Commission  orders.   386 U.S. at 233-34 . Yet no such unfairness results by applying the Finality Act prospectively to finalize orders entered  after July 1959.   See   Sperry Rand Corp. v. FTC, 110 U.S. App. D.C. 1, 288 F.2d 403 (1961) , cited with approval in  Jantzen , for  an excellent discussion of this point.  Secondly -- and apparently more importantly -- the Court recognized that a failure to apply the old enforcement procedures to  pre-1959 orders would mean that such orders could not be enforced at all.   386 U.S. at 234 . As a result, some 400 violators  would have been absolved from Commission orders and the Commission would have to begin anew against all 400.  Yet no  such unsatisfactory result occurs by applying the Finality Act to orders entered after its passage.  On the contrary, to apply the  old procedures to all Commission proceedings begun before July 1959, would significantly postpone the operation of the Act.   For example, in our case, the Commission would be required to use the "laborious, time consuming, and very expensive" 3-step  enforcement procedure rejected by Congress in 1959, S. Rep. No. 83, 86th Cong., 1st Sess., 2 (1959), to enforce an order  entered a full six years after the new procedures were enacted.  Such a result is wholly inconsistent with the legislative purpose  of expediting the enforcement of Commission orders.  The only sensible construction of the Act would be to apply it as soon as  the fairness consideration mentioned above would allow.  S. Rep. No. 83,  supra .  Accordingly, we conclude that both the holding  in  Jantzen  and its rationale were necessarily confined to pre-1959 orders, and that the legislative purpose demands that the  Finality Act be applied to post-1959 orders such as the one admitted below.  We believe that the  Sperry Rand  decision  mentioned above fully supports our conclusion.  We find no cases suggesting the contrary. The Congressional Record indicates at 9068 that the proponent of the original bill was allotted eight hours for general debate.   It is our understanding from the Congressional Record that the opponents also consumed eight hours. We note two instances where material quoted to us has a different meaning when viewed in fuller context.  First, emphasis  has been placed by Forster in its brief on an exchange between Senators Sutherland and Crawford concerning an amendment  to the Federal Trade Commission Act:  "Mr. Sutherland. . . . So far as the findings of the commission are concerned, I do not think they ought to be evidence  anywhere.  "Mr. Crawford: I do not either.  "Mr. Sutherland.  I doubt very much whether we could make them evidence." 51 Cong. Rec. 12789-90 (1914). Yet this brief exchange is less persuasive when placed in context.  The amendment, proposed by Senator Cummins of Iowa and  accepted by Senator Newlands for the Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee, provided:  "That no order or finding of the court or commission in the enforcement of this section shall be admissible as evidence in  any suit, civil or criminal, brought under the antitrust laws." 51 Cong. Rec. 12726 (1914). 

--- 頁碼 65 ---
The reason for the amendment was not that an order of the Commission was not of the dignity of that of a court but that  "The order of the court or the commission . . . would be simply that the defendant had been guilty of unfair competition. . . .  It is the purpose of this amendment to prevent the judgment in one case becoming res adjudicata in the other case". 51  Cong. Rec. 12787 (1914) (remarks of Sen. Cummins). This amendment passed the Senate by a vote of 40 to 13. 51 Cong. Rec. 12804 (1914).  Although it did not find its way into the  final bill in that form, the Senate had equated orders of the Commission with those of a court.  Moreover, the underlying  assumption must have been that orders of the Commission, unless specifically banned, could be evidence in subsequent civil or  criminal proceedings.  Secondly, our attention has been directed to the following remark by Senator Walsh, the spokesman for the Judiciary  Committee, which appears at 51 Cong. Rec. 13856-13857:  "I want to say just a word with reference to the authorities to which the attention of the Senate has been invited. . . . Nobody  questions them. They all lay down the rule that in an action brought against an individual who has never theretofore had his  day in court you can not make a certificate or a recital or an order of an administrative board or anything of that kind  conclusive evidence against him." However, in his very next sentence Senator Walsh states that "You may make it prima facie evidence." Thus, even in 1914, it  was recognized that a Commission order could be given prima facie effect.  Of course the statute as eventually enacted contained the prima facie evidentiary effect which Senator Walsh had said could  properly be given to administrative orders.  One can only conjecture why Senator Walsh did not later point out that the bill as  changed could include administrative orders as well as court orders. A few isolated references to juries have been brought to our attention -- e.g., 51 Cong. Rec. 13900, 13901 (1914) -- but since  it has long been accepted that a judgment in a non-jury trial is admissible under section 5(a) -- e.g.,  Hanover Shoe v. United  Shoe Machinery, 392 U.S. 481, 20 L. Ed. 2d 1231, 88 S. Ct. 2224 (1968)  -- those few references cannot be said to limit the  reach of section 5(a).

K. Llewellyn, The Common Law Tradition -- Deciding Appeals, 374 (1960). Professor Llewellyn continues:  "Broad purposes can indeed reach far beyond details known or knowable at the time of drafting.  A 'dangerous weapon'  statute of 1840 can include Tommy guns, tear gas, or atomic bombs.  'Vehicle,' in a statute of 1840, can properly be read,  when sense so suggests, to include an automobile, or a hydroplane that lacks wheels.  But for all that, the sound quest  does not run primarily in terms of historical intent.  It runs in terms of what the words can be made to bear, in making sense  in the new light of what was originally unforeseen."  See also   Schwegmann Bros. v. Calvert Corp., 341 U.S. 384, 395-396,  95 L. Ed. 1035, 71 S. Ct. 745 (1951)  (Jackson, J., concurring). See  Antitrust Developments 1955-1968, pp. 248-251 (1968). Accord :  United States v. E. I.

Forster also attaches some significance to the fact that one does not have the benefit of Article III judges when one is before the  Commission.  Yet we know of no cases saying that due process can only be dispensed by Article III judges.  On the contrary, it  seems clear that procedural due process is accorded defendants before the Federal Trade Commission. We note also that the  Supreme Court has accorded the Commissioners an element of protection from the political process once they are in office.   Humphrey's Executor v.

Necessarily implicit in these decisions is the proposition that a final Commission order is qualitatively comparable to a court  judgment. 

--- 頁碼 69 ---
Forster, ill-advisedly in our view, urges that this issue was not open to Farmington, since Farmington's notice of appeal was  more than 30 days from the date of final judgment.  Final judgment was entered on March 11, 1969; Forster noticed its appeal on March 17.  On March 18, Farmington filed a timely  motion under  Rule 59(e), Fed. R. Civ. P. , to amend the judgment insofar as it refused to award reasonable attorney fees, which  motion was denied on March 26.  On April 25 -- 45 days after final judgment, but only 30 days after denial of the  Rule 59(e)   motion -- Farmington noticed its appeal.  HN8 [ ]  Rule 4(a), Fed. R. App. P. , expressly provides that the 30-day time for appeal shall commence anew following the  entry of an order concerning any timely motion under,  inter alia ,  Rule 59(e) .  Indeed, there was no artful way for Farmington to  file a general appeal before March 26, for any such general appeal might have placed the district court in the awkward position  of having lost jurisdiction while still being asked by the same party to make a specific alteration of the judgment.  March 26 was  the logical time to start the 30-day period and  Rule 4(a)  so provides.  We do not understand  Rule 4(a)  to attach any significance  to the fact that the appeal of April 25 raised more objections to the judgment than had the  Rule 59(e)  motion. Specifically, Farmington requested admission pursuant to section 5(a) of the following documents:  1.  Examiner's Initial Decision, dated February 2, 1962, as it relates to skewers;  2.  Opinion of the Commission, dated January 3, 1963, as it relates to skewers;  3.  Final Order, dated March 18, 1963, as it relates to skewers;  4.  Opinion on Remand, dated July 23, 1965, as it relates to skewers, and  5.  Final Order, dated July 23, 1965, as it relates to skewers. In addition Farmington compiled the findings made therein and presented its compilation as Plaintiff's Exhibit IB(iv), which  included the following categories: formal identification of defendant (items 1 and 2); the shares of the six skewer manufacturers  in the U.S. market (item 3); the early history of Farmington (items 4-6); the development of animosity between Farmington and  Forster, cancellation of orders from Farmington by Forster, Farmington's efforts to seek other customers, various threats and  general price cuts by Forster (items 7-17); discriminatory price cuts given to four customers by Forster (items 18-25); causal  relation between the discriminatory price cuts and Farmington's failure and lessening of competition in the skewer industry  generally, tending to create a monopoly in the skewer industry, absence of justifiable reason (items 26-33); conclusions that  Forster was "not merely meeting competition, but . . . beating it", that "this is not a close case" concerning good faith meeting of  competition, that Forster was motivated by predatory intent (items 34-38).

Additional authorities suggest that the "necessarily decided" limitation is rather firmly embedded in the law of collateral  estoppel. In  Yates v. United States, 354 U.S. 298, 336, 1 L. Ed. 2d 1356, 77 S. Ct. 1064 (1957) , the Supreme Court asserted:  " . .  HN10 [ ] . the doctrine of collateral estoppel . . . makes conclusive in subsequent proceedings only determinations of  fact, and mixed fact and law, that were  essential  to the decision. . . .   Commissioner v. Sunnen, 333 U.S. 591, 601-602, 92  L. Ed. 898, 68 S. Ct. 715 ;  Tait v. Western Maryland R. Co., 289 U.S. 620, 77 L. Ed. 1405, 53 S. Ct. 706 ;  The Evergreens v.  Nunan, 141 F.2d 927, 928 ."    Years earlier, Judge Learned Hand had occasion to confront this problem:  " HN11 [ ] A judgment . . . may be an estoppel . . . the estoppel extends only to facts decided and necessary to the  decision.  All this is very old law."  Irving National Bank v. Law, 10 F.2d 721, 724 (2d Cir. 1926) . See also  Restatement, Judgments § 68(1) and comment o; 1B Moore's Federal Practice, 2d Ed., para. 0.441[2], p. 3777. At 338, the Court stated:  " HN12 [ ] The normal rule is that a prior judgment need be given no conclusive effect at all unless it establishes one of the  ultimate facts in issue in the subsequent proceeding.  So far as merely evidentiary or 'mediate' facts are concerned, the  doctrine of collateral estoppel is inoperative.   The Evergreens v. Nunan, 141 F.2d 927 ;  Restatement, Judgments § 68,  comment p ."   But see   Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. v. Goldwyn, 328 F.2d 190, 225-226 (9th Cir. 1964) , cert. denied,  379 U.S. 880, 13 L.  Ed. 2d 87, 85 S. Ct. 143 (1964) . This case is cited appropriately by Farmington for the proposition that all matters decided in a  prior proceeding which are "relevant" to a subsequent one are admissible under section 5(a).  We find the case enigmatic, for its  referenced authority in  Emich , but its formulation of principle overlooked the "necessarily decided" limitation expressed in  Emich .   It may well be that the findings held to be admissible qualified under  Emich .  But we cannot take the brief and possibly  unconsidered reference to a standard of mere relevancy in  Twentieth Century Fox  as definitive.  See our opinion in  International  Shoe Machinery Corp. v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., 315 F.2d 449, 453-454, 459 (1st Cir. 1963) , for a discussion of our view  of how "relevancy" bears on the operation of section 5(a).

HN14 [ ] Section 2(a) of the Clayton Act, as amended by the Robinson-Patman Act,  15 U.S.C. § 13 (a) , provides in relevant  part:  "It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, . . . to discriminate in price between different purchasers of  commodities . . . where the effect of such discrimination may be substantially to lessen competition or tend to create a  monopoly in any line of commerce . . . ." Of course nothing we say herein concerning collateral estoppel is intended to detract from the general rule, which has our  unqualified support, that the Commission should set forth its findings of fact, reasoning and conclusions of law as fully and  carefully as possible. We understand Forster to misunderstand Farmington's argument on this point.  Forster argues that Farmington cannot get lost  profits from 1956 to November 1968 in addition to its "going concern" value as of February 1958.  We of course agree.   See   discussion in text,  infra .  Yet we understand Farmington, at least initially, to be seeking its "going concern" value as of November

1968 (Trial Record, Vol. 5, pp. 169, 190; Brief, p. 43), rather than as of February 1958 as Forster's argument suggests. (Reply  Brief, pp. 18-19) Farmington seems to draw the greatest comfort from  Twentieth Century-Fox Corp. v. Brookside Theatre Corp., 194 F.2d 846  (8th Cir. 1952) , cert. denied,  343 U.S. 942, 96 L. Ed. 1348, 72 S. Ct. 1035 (1952) . That case did take account of lost profits for a  period after the time that the plaintiff had been driven out of business.  However, critical distinctions exist.  First, unlike our case,  the business in that case was continued in essentially the same form by one of the defendants, thereby producing  actual  profits  over the period in question which could be estimated with some degree of certainty.  Secondly, that court did not make an award  for future lost profits  in addition to  an award for "going concern" value, which is what Farmington seeks here.  Finally, to the  extent that the court may have awarded what could be called the "going concern" value of the plaintiff there, it was figured as of  the day that the plaintiff had been forced out of business.  Farmington relies also on  Atlas Building Products Co. v. Diamond Block & Gravel Co., 269 F.2d 950 (10th Cir. 1959) , cert.  denied,  363 U.S. 843, 4 L. Ed. 2d 1727, 80 S. Ct. 1608 (1960) , which decision upheld an award of lost profits and diminished  asset value.  Yet the method used by the district court in our case awards both aspects of damages.  The basic dispute between  the district court and Farmington seems to us to concern the date for which "going concern" value should be determined.  The  Atlas Building  case gives no indication of the date for which "diminished asset" value was determined in that case.  Since that  business continued up to the time of trial, there is little speculation involved in estimating "diminished asset" value as of the time  of trial, assuming arguendo that the court did so.  Yet in our case, when the business ends on a given date, it seems far too  speculative to give "going concern" value for a date ten years after it had ceased to be a going concern. E. Timberlake, "The Legal Injury Requirements and Proof of Damages in Treble Damage Actions Under the Antitrust Laws",  30 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 231, 280 (1961). We note that the district court stated its reason in terms of "duplication".  On analysis,  we see no duplication in estimating ten years' profits, followed by an estimate of the going concern value at the end of those ten  years -- which involves putative profits for subsequent years.  But, for reasons stated, we agree with the district court's ruling.

The district court noted at least four reasons why the two businesses were not sufficiently comparable. First, while  Farmington's production was limited almost entirely to wooden skewers, Forster manufactured some 24 woodenware products in  addition to skewers, which comprised a relatively small proportion of its total business.  Second, Farmington had no sales or  distribution organization which was remotely comparable to the extensive sales and distribution organization which Forster  maintained throughout the United States.  Third, Farmington was minimally capitalized, while Forster was adequately  capitalized.  Finally, Forster would be an inappropriate yardstick of comparison after 1956 simply because Forster's sales and  profits after that time reflected the illegal monopolization and discriminatory sales which Farmington had to show in order to be  entitled to any damages.  Clearly Farmington was no more entitled to the monopoly profit than Forster was.  The only countervailing evidence offered by Farmington was Professor Chances' own testimony that Farmington and Forster  were selling a similarly-made product to the same general group of customers.

We recognize that a witness somewhat similar to Richard Norton was allowed to testify in both  Story Parchment, supra at 567 ,  and in  William H. Rankin v. Associated Bill Posters of United States and Canada, 42 F.2d 152, 155 (2d Cir. 1930) . However, we  find nothing in either case to suggest that such a witness  must  be allowed to testify. Arriving at value through capitalization of projected earnings involves evaluating "the present worth of each part of the stream  of future receipts" and adding "these separate present discounted values." Samuelson, Economics: An Introductory Analysis, 6th  ed., p. 587.  Capitalized market value is  not  arrived at simply by multiplying average earnings and an appropriate number of  years, the method apparently used by Norton.

This figure is claimed by Forster to be impeached by the testimony of its expert that the $13,103 figure was inflated by at least  $10,000, apparently by reason of an understated beginning inventory.  Yet this writedown was not conclusively established, and  the jury apparently accepted the $14,500 figure for the purpose of arriving at its award of $29,100 for lost profits between May  1956 and February 1958, which award was not appealed.  Even if there had been such an alleged writedown, the effect would  would have been to make 1955 more profitable and the first 8 months of 1956 less so -- not, on balance, a critically different  posture for Farmington.  While Forster could have better argued a downward dip, Farmington could have pointed to a more  impressive showing prior to the intense period of pressure from Forster. It seems to have been assumed by all parties that Forster was the most similar to Farmington although not comparable  enough to be used as a yardstick.   See  n. 48,  supra . The value of orders cancelled ($28,950) amounted to 20% of the projected yearly purchases by Forster, and 12% (or one and  a half months) of Farmington's total sales.  While the case contents and unit price to arrive at these figures were in evidence, we  do not suppose that the jury made this precise a calculation.  But it would have been justified in concluding that the cancellation  posed a substantial problem.

HN17 [ ]  Section 4  of the Clayton Act,  15 U.S.C. § 15 (1964) , provides:  "Any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue  therefor . . . and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained, and the cost of suit, including a reasonable  attorney's fee." It should be noted that Farmington had three different law firms working on this case at various times.  The fee arrangement in  question provides that the chief counsel will get two thirds of the fee and that the two local counsel will share one third. A second aspect of Farmington's appeal of the court's ruling under  section 4  of the Clayton Act concerned the court's refusal  to award Farmington some $6,920.77 as its "cost of suit".  Having carefully read the district court's treatment of this issue at 930  of the above-noted opinion and the cases cited therein, we are satisfied that Farmington's claim was properly denied. At the outset, Forster contends that Farmington is without "standing" on this issue and is not "the real party in interest" since,  under Farmington's fee arrangement, any recovery would go to Farmington's attorneys.  This argument is without merit.  As we  note below, the statutory provision authorizing the recovery of counsel fees was intended to benefit antitrust plaintiffs by enabling  them to retain the bulk of their trebled damages.  It is clearly the plaintiff's statutory right; it was not intended to confer a statutory  

--- 頁碼 78 ---
right on plaintiff's counsel and no one to our knowledge has ever seriously suggested that attorneys have standing under  section 4 .  Since the provision conferred a right on plaintiffs, they must have standing to assert it.  The fact that Farmington may  be contractually obligated with regard to the recovery does not affect its statutory right or its standing to assert it.  Invoking the "real party in interest" rule adds nothing to Forster's argument, since the real party in interest need not be the party  beneficially interested in a particular case, but only the party who under the substantive law has the right sought to be enforced.  3A Moore's Federal Practice, para. 17.07. The court, not desiring to interfere with that part of the fee agreement calling for one third of the treble damages, was willing to  tolerate a margin of difference between its  section 4  decision and the amount actually to be paid counsel.  It noted that one third  of treble damages was "already nearly 30% more than it has concluded is reasonable."  297 F. Supp. at 929 . It then looked at the  total amount which the fee agreement would produce, and noted that this would be twice what it found reasonable, 175% of  single damages, 58% of trebled damages, and would result in hourly rates of compensation for senior and junior partners and  associates beyond those realized from the  section 4  fee allowances in the cases listed in Appendices of its opinion.  As a final  reason, the court noted that counsel for plaintiff had sought only $109,100 as the amount of the "attorney's fee" award under  section 4 . HN18 [ ] Canons of Professional Ethics, Canon 13:  "A contract for a contingent fee, where sanctioned by law, should be reasonable under all the circumstances of the case,  including the risk and uncertainty of the compensation,  but should always be subject to the supervision of a court , as to its  reasonableness." See also  Canon 12.  E.g.,  Fitzgerald v. Freeman, 409 F.2d 427 (7th Cir. 1969) , cert. denied,  396 U.S. 875, 90 S. Ct. 151, 24 L. Ed. 2d 134, 38  U.S.L.W. 3139 (1969) ;  Gair v. Peck, 6 N.Y. 2d 97, 188 N.Y.S.2d 491, 160 N.E.2d 43 (1959) , cert. denied,  361 U.S. 374, 4 L. Ed.  2d 380, 80 S. Ct. 401 (1960) ;  Taylor v. Bemiss, 110 U.S. 42, 45-46, 28 L. Ed. 64, 3 S. Ct. 441 (1884) ;  McCreary v. Joel, 186 So.  2d 4, 6 (1966) ;  see  F. MacKinnon, Contingent Fees for Legal Services, p. 66 (1964). We can think of at least three reasons why a court might be more inclined to inquire into successful plaintiff's actual counsel  fees in an antitrust case.  Clients may feel some distrust or disrespect for the legal profession when they are called on to honor  fee arrangements which yield fees out of proportion to what the court declared to be a reasonable fee for purposes of  section 4 .   

--- 頁碼 79 ---
Moreover, since the court is already immersed in the counsel fee inquiry under  section 4 , it is not a great step further to  measure the actual counsel fee against the Canons of Ethics.  Finally, to the extent that  section 4  was intended to prevent a  substantial diminution of the plaintiff's treble damage recovery, that purpose is frustrated when the attorney is allowed, without  justification, to siphon off a substantial part of that award in addition to other compensation.  On the other hand, in addition to all of the considerations which invariably tend to restrain a  sua sponte  intervention by the court,  it seems unfortunate to single out the antitrust bar for such scrutiny.  We have no reason to believe that any abuses exist in this  area which would justify its being treated differently from any other field of litigation.  Moreover, we are aware that an actual  counsel fee inquiry in every antitrust case might tend to impair the ability of private litigants to acquire effective counsel to assist  them in their efforts as private attorneys general.  A balancing of these considerations can be struck only by the district courts  acting in their sound discretion. While this may have been the neat division contemplated by  section 4 , we do not suggest that  section 4  corseted either  courts or attorneys and clients too tightly.   Section 4  obliged a court to fix an amount which was reasonable in light of the terrain  it had crossed with counsel, which amount was to be added to the damages the defendant should pay both as a penalty and as  a method of enabling the plaintiff to emerge with something approaching three times his proven loss.  On the other hand, clients  and lawyers were left to make their own arrangements.  We recognize that in some difficult cases a fee arrangement entirely  consistent with the Canons of Ethics could result in a substantial diminution of the plaintiff's treble damage recovery without  offending  section 4 .  Accordingly, the actual fee arrangement between lawyer and client should have no bearing on what the  court awards under  section 4 .   Milwaukee Towne Corp. v. Loew's, Inc., 190 F.2d 561, 570 (7th Cir. 1951) , cert. denied,  342 U.S.  909, 72 S. Ct. 302, 96 L. Ed. 680 (1952) ;  Noerr Motor Freight, Inc. v. Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference, 166 F. Supp.  163, 169 (E.D. Pa. 1958) , aff'd,  273 F.2d 218 (3rd Cir. 1959) , rev'd on other grounds,  365 U.S. 127, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464, 81 S. Ct.  523 (1961) ;  Webster Motor Car Co. v. Packard Motor Car Co., 166 F. Supp. 865, 866 (D.D.C. 1955) , cross appeal dismissed as  moot,  100 U.S. App. D.C. 161, 243 F.2d 418 (D.C. Cir. 1957) , cert. denied,  355 U.S. 822, 78 S. Ct. 29, 2 L. Ed. 2d 38 (1957) . 

--- 頁碼 80 ---
That a client, as here, remains willing to abide by his fee contract is relevant but not controlling, for the object of the court's  concern is not only a particular party but the conformance of the legal profession to its own high standards of fairness.

For example, in the critical area of product and specification approval, the federal government maintains elaborate independent  testing services and a system of appeals to the Comptroller General for suppliers aggrieved by decisions of the contracting  authority.   See  R. Nash and J. Cibinic, Federal Procurement Law, 170-177 (1966).  State and local authorities, however,  sometimes delegate this function entirely to so-called "strong" architects hired to supervise a particular project. Paddock feels that these allegations are not germane, in part because deception does not vitiate an otherwise valid  Noerr   defense,  365 U.S. at 145 , and in part because Whitten has not challenged the validity of Paddock's patent.   Noerr , apart,  however, we think systematic tale-tellling coupled with other relevant factors such as conspiracy or monopoly power may  constitute an antitrust violation.  We also doubt whether one must as a matter of law challenge the validity of a patent in order to

complain of the uses to which it is put.  Cf.   United States v. Singer Manufacturing Co., 374 U.S. 174, 10 L. Ed. 2d 823, 83 S. Ct.  1773 (1963) . HN2 [ ] While the two doctrines are often treated as one, we agree with Paddock's separate treatment of each.  The two are  not coterminous.  For example, an unsuccessful attempt to influence government action may fall within the  Noerr-Pennington   immunity, but not the  Parker  immunity. Conversely, a state regulatory agency may decide to restrain competition without  prompting; the beneficiaries, not having solicited government action, would enjoy a  Parker  immunity but not one based on  Noerr- Pennington .  Moreover, because of its  First Amendment  overtones, the  Noerr-Pennington  immunity is arguably broader than the  Parker  exemption. Paddock has cited one lower court decision,  United States v. Johns-Manville Corp., 259 F. Supp. 440 (E.D. Pa. 1966) , which  involved substantially similar facts and raised, among others, the precise issue raised here.  The court, relying on  Noerr  and  Pennington , granted summary judgment for defendant without extended analysis.  For reasons which we express in the text, we  disagree with this broad application of the  Noerr-Pennington  rule.

Some have been troubled by the fact that the mineowners approached not only the Secretary of Labor, but also the TVA.   See   Note, Application of the Sherman Act to Efforts to Influence Government Action, 81 Harv. L. Rev. 847, 853 (1968). However,  since the TVA had the power to undermine the Secretary's decision by making "spot market" purchases from low wage  operators, the mineowners' conduct seems a reasonable addendum to the main proceedings before the Secretary. Unlike Paddock, we do not read  Continental Ore  to mean that any action by a Canadian public official would have resulted in  exemption. An anti-competitive practice may receive only the most cursory inspection by public officials,  see   Woods Exploration  Co. v. Alcoa, 36 F.R.D. 107 (S.D. Texas 1963) , or public officials may approve conduct without consideration or awareness of its  anti-competitive aspects.   Cf.   Angle v. Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis and Omaha Rwy. Co., 151 U.S. 1, 38 L. Ed. 55, 14 S. Ct.  240 (1893) . The issue in such cases is not whether the action was in form "governmental", but whether the real decision makers  were public officials or private businessmen.   See  American Bar Association, 1955-1968 Antitrust Developments, 211-12 (1968).

Our reliance on state bidding statutes should not be taken as approval of Whitten's argument that Paddock's selling efforts fall  within the Sherman Act because Paddock's specifications are illegal under state bidding statutes.  State law on the validity of  restrictive specifications varies widely. 63 C.J.S. Municipal Corporations § 1149: 43 Am. Jur. Public Works and Contracts §§ 16- 17.  We do not, therefore, equate immunity with legality under state law.  Rather, we rely on bidding statutes as clear indicia that  government is acting as a consumer rather than as a regulator.

In advancing this argument, Paddock places heavy reliance on the deposition of Mr. George Whitten, president of Whitten,  Inc., who admitted that he did not intend to allege that Paddock refused to sell its gutter system unless the purchaser also  agreed to buy accessory equipment.  This admission, however, must be qualified by Mr. Whitten's later allegation that Paddock  has engaged in discriminatory pricing which had the effect of a refusal to deal.  Moreover, a seller need not refuse to sell his  tying product outright in order to induce purchasers to enter an illegal tying agreement; he may, for example, offer discounts for  those who purchase both tying and tied products or threaten litigation against those who refuse to accept the whole package.   Mr. Whitten's admission does not, therefore, dispose of the tying issue as a matter of law.

The same libellant fared less well two weeks later before Judge Clary, who ruled in  Kamara v. The Atlantic Emperor, 97 F.  Supp. 722, 725 (E.D. Pa. 1951) , that a cause of action for blacklisting "clearly is not an action cognizable in admiralty since no  part of it is alleged to have taken place on navigable waters." 

--- 頁碼 104 ---
Similarly referenced was  J. W. Peterson Coal & Oil Co. v. United States, 323 F. Supp. 1198, 1201 (N.D. Ill. 1970) , where the  action of the United States in supplying a dredging contractor with maps and information as to river depths and dredging  locations was held sufficient to invoke admiralty jurisdiction in tort. Apart from relying on the general locality test for admiralty tort jurisdiction, appellees cite only four cases said to be closely in  point.   One is Kamara v. The Atlantic Emperor, 97 F. Supp. 722 (E.D. Pa. 1951) , referred to in n. 2,  supra , and which simply  declared that the alleged blacklisting of crew members had not occurred on navigable waters. This we find close on point but not  persuasive.  Clinton v. International Organization of Masters, 254 F.2d 370 (9th Cir. 1958) , involved,  inter alia , a claim of tortious  interference with a contract between a union member and his local union governing allocation of available jobs. The court held  the contract not maritime in nature and further observed that the tort was not alleged to have been committed on navigable  waters. We find this less on point and no more persuasive. Finally, two old cases from the Southern District of New York were  cited.   Marquardt v. French, 53 F. 603 (1893) , simply held that, a contract to procure insurance not being a maritime contract,

Opinion  Of the District of Maine, sitting by designation. 

--- 頁碼 109 ---
An "occurrence" policy protects the holder from liability for any act done while the policy is in effect; a "claims made" policy, in  contrast, protects the holder only against claims made during the policy's life. Thus a doctor who practiced for only one year, say  1972, would need only one 1972 "occurrence" policy to be fully covered, but he would need several years of "claims made"  policies to protect himself from claims arising out of his acts in 1972. At our request, both sides briefed the question of whether the plaintiffs' antitrust claim was mooted when the state of Rhode  Island formed a joint underwriting association to provide malpractice insurance. Because of the state's action, St. Paul never  gathered the fruits of the alleged conspiracy. Nonetheless, we are convinced that, for purposes of our jurisdiction, the state's act  did not extinguish plaintiffs' every claim for relief.   United States v. Concentrated Phosphate Export Ass'n, Inc. 393 U.S. 199,  203-04, 89 S. Ct. 361, 21 L. Ed. 2d 344 (1968) . We do not decide whether plaintiffs were in fact "injured in [their] business or  property".   15 U.S.C. § 15 ,  Cf . n. 7  infra . Nor do we decide whether this would be an appropriate case for injunctive relief.

In attacking the district court's decision, appellants cite an additional case from the Fifth Circuit.  Battle v. Liberty Nat'l Life Ins.   Co., 493 F.2d 39 (5th Cir. 1974) ,  cert. denied ,  419 U.S. 1110, 42 L. Ed. 2d 807, 95 S. Ct. 784 (1975) . Although appellees  correctly point out that  Battle  is distinguishable and that it was decided before  Meicler, supra , the  Battle  court did not show a  willingness to give the boycott provision a straightforward reading, an attitude that we share.  See also  Ballard v. Blue Shield, 543  F.2d 1075, 1078 (4th Cir. 1976) ,  cert. denied ,  430 U.S. 922, 97 S. Ct. 1341, 51 L. Ed. 2d 601, 45 U.S.L.W. 3601 (1977) . Most cases have dealt with boycotts directed against retailers or other links in the chain of production and distribution.  E.g.,  Fashion Originators' Guild of America, Inc. v. FTC, 312 U.S. 457, 85 L. Ed. 949, 61 S. Ct. 703 (1941) ;  Radiant Burners, Inc. v.  Peoples Gas Light and Coke Co., 364 U.S. 656, 5 L. Ed. 2d 358, 81 S. Ct. 365 (1961) . Consumers have less frequently been  prey to illegal boycotts, perhaps because a large class of victims cannot easily be coerced without destroying the secrecy on  

--- 頁碼 111 ---
which illegal boycotts often depend. But the features that make boycotts objectionable do not disappear when consumers are  boycotted. Like boycotts aimed at retailers, concerted refusals to deal with consumers may restrain traders' "ability to sell in  accordance with their own judgment"; they can deprive consumers of the "freedom to buy . . . in an open competitive market";  and they "interfere with the natural flow of interstate commerce".  See  Klor's, Inc. v. Broadway-Hale Stores, Inc., supra, 359 U.S.  at 212-13 . The Ninth Circuit has held that a boycott of customers is a boycott for antitrust purposes.   Washington State Bowling  Proprietors Ass'n v. Pacific Lanes, Inc., 356 F.2d 371, 376  (9th Cir.),  cert. denied ,  384 U.S. 963, 16 L. Ed. 2d 674, 86 S. Ct.  1590 (1966) . Some commentators would artificially restrict the meaning of "boycott", apparently fearing an overbroad application of the rule  that boycotts are illegal per se.  See  L. Sullivan,  Antitrust  §§ 83, 90 (1977). This fear may be allayed more directly by recognizing  that, while some boycotts are irredeemably anticompetitive and thus fit subjects for a per se rule, others are benign and not  properly treated as illegal per se.  See  P.  Areeda,  Antitrust Analysis  287 (1967);  see also  Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, Inc. v.  Hawaiian Oke & Liquors, Ltd., 416 F.2d 71 (9th Cir. 1969)  (boycott not illegal per se when participants had no anti-competitive  motive).  Certainly nothing in this opinion requires the application of a per se rule to all acts falling within the ordinary meaning of  the word "boycott".

We cannot ignore, however, the great haste with which the Act was drafted and passed. The provision that all now agree is  central to the Act - the exception of insurance to the extent that it is regulated by state law - did not appear in the Act until it was  inserted by the House and Senate conferees.  See  91 Cong.Rec. 488 (1945);  id . 1945;  id. 1396 .  Only at the last moment did a  measure that was intended originally as a three-year moratorium on Sherman and Clayton Act coverage become a lasting  exemption. This change was not noted in the conference report or the statement of the House conferees,  id ., although it was  uncovered by Senator Pepper in the floor debates.  Id. at 1478 . S.Rep.No. 20, 79th Cong., 1st Sess. (1945), accompanying S. 340; and H.Rep.No. 143, 79th Cong., 1st Sess. (1945).

We recognize that the dismissal could be affirmed if none of the plaintiffs have standing to sue. But the change in malpractice  coverage has increased costs for the doctors. The alleged conspiracy thus strikes at their "business or property",  15 U.S.C. § 15 ,  even if that phrase refers only to "commercial interests".   Hawaii v.

Dissent The Supreme Court has said that "the relationship between insurer and insured, the type of policy which [can] be issued, its  reliability, interpretation, and enforcement - these [are] the core of the 'business of insurance'" covered by the McCarran- Ferguson Act.   SEC v. National Securities, Inc., 393 U.S. 453, 460, 21 L. Ed. 2d 668, 89 S. Ct. 564 (1969) . I do not question that the boycott-coercion-intimidation language might in some other context be pushed to the limits which the  court approves. But these words are hardly so focused as to permit only the broadest, most general meaning. A more limited  interpretation, besides comporting with the statutory structure and the legislative history, squares with the Supreme Court's  definition of a group boycott as "concerted refusals by traders to deal with other traders",  Klor's Inc. v. Broadway-Hale Stores,  Inc., 359 U.S. 207, 212, 3 L. Ed. 2d 741, 79 S. Ct. 705 (1959) .  See  L. Sullivan,  Antitrust  § 90 at 257 (1976). Furthermore, even reading the boycott exception to include the complained of behavior does not wholly solve the question of  plaintiffs' standing. If St. Paul is attempting to corner the malpractice market, the more obvious harm is to those companies that  are being closed out. It can be argued that the higher prices to doctors are only an indirect consequence and that the physicians  have not suffered the sort of direct injury necessary to bring suit.  See  Battle v. Liberty National Life Insurance Co., 493 F.2d 39,  49 (5th Cir. 1974) ,  cert. denied ,  419 U.S. 1110, 42 L. Ed. 2d 807, 95 S. Ct. 784 (1975)  (plaintiff must show himself to be in  sector of economy in which violation threatens to break down competitive conditions). This sort of problem suggests that the  doctors' ostensible antitrust action is aimed less at protecting the free market system than at consumer protection goals left by

 The directive stated: "In response to overwhelming demands by the rank and file members of the Union, the leadership of ILA today ordered  immediate suspension in handling all Russian ships and all Russian cargoes in ports from Maine to Texas and Puerto Rico  where ILA workers are employed. "This order is effective across the board on all vessels and all cargoes. Grain and other foods as well as high valued general  freight. However, any Russian ship now in process of loading or discharging at a waterfront will be worked until completion. "The reason for this action should be apparent in light of international events that have affected relations between the U. S. &  Soviet Union. "However, the decision by the Union leadership was made necessary by the demands of the workers. "It is their will to refuse to work Russian vessels and Russian cargoes under present conditions of the world. "People are upset and they refuse to continue the business as usual policy as long as the Russians insist on being international  bully boys. It is a decision in which the Union leadership concurs."

 The elusiveness of any attempt to fit aspects of this rather unique case comfortably within the traditional categories of labor  law is illustrated by the fact that the "primary dispute" could just as easily, and perhaps more appropriately, be characterized as  one between Afghanistan and Russia (or assuming the viewpoint of the ILA, between the Soviet Union and American  governments). There is no dispute between the ILA and Russia over matters traditionally thought to be the subject of union  concern. In  Madden v. Grain Elevator Workers Local 418, 334 F.2d 1014 (7th Cir. 1964) , cert. denied,  379 U.S. 967, 85 S. Ct. 661, 13 L.  Ed. 2d 560 (1965)  (discussed infra), an American union directed employees of an American grain wholesaler not to load grain  onto ships owned by a Canadian employer engaged in a dispute with a Canadian union. There was no suggestion of a primary  dispute or any dispute between the American union and the Canadian shipper, regardless of the fact that the American union  may have disapproved of the way in which the Canadian employer was treating Canadian union members. In conventional labor  law analysis, the court found the primary dispute to be between the Canadian employer and the Canadian union, and the  secondary dispute to be between the American union and the American employer. If the analogy is followed here, the primary  

--- 頁碼 133 ---
dispute is between the USSR and Afghanistan, and the secondary dispute between the ILA and persons carrying Russian-made  goods.

 Contrary to the suggestion in Judge Aldrich's separate opinion, this conclusion is not dependent on the "result reached." We  quite agree that "either an act of Congress covers a particular dispute or it does not"; in our view, however, section 8(b)(4)  "covers" this dispute, and we believe that the scope of the Benz-Mobile line of cases is narrower than the dissent/concurrence  would have it. We understand our brother to construe the Benz-Mobile line as reflecting a fundamental principle that Board  jurisdiction exists only where the Board has jurisdiction over the primary dispute. But we think those cases are adequately  explained on the principle that in a case involving intertwined "primary" and "secondary" labor disputes, lack of Board jurisdiction  over the primary dispute will preclude Board jurisdiction over the secondary conduct more particularly where a contrary ruling  might well suggest an improper interference by the United States in the relationship between foreign employers and laborers.  We see no need to extend Benz-Mobile beyond this.  Accepting that the boycott sought to protest Soviet aggression, we may still note that this goal of protest was certainly  furthered by causing Clark and Waterman to cease handling Allied's Russian-made goods and was additionally enhanced by  Allied's resulting cutback in its trade with the Soviet Union.

 The conclusion might be somewhat different in a situation where identical union conduct could be found to be either protected  primary activity or unlawful secondary activity depending on the union's objective. For example, in  National Woodwork Mfrs.  Ass'n v. NLRB, 386 U.S. 612, 87 S. Ct. 1250, 18 L. Ed. 2d 357 (1967) , the Court considered whether a union's refusal to handle  prefabricated goods was a protected effort to preserve the jobs of union members or activity calculated to satisfy the union's  objectives elsewhere. The Court held that once it was found, by reference to circumstances such as "the threat of displacement  by the banned product or services, the history of labor relations between the union and the employers who would be boycotted,  and the economic personality of the industry,"  id., at 644 n.38, 87 S. Ct. at 1268 n.38 , that the union action did serve the  legitimate purpose of work preservation, the conduct could not be held unlawful simply because it had the ancillary effect of  diminishing business between the employer and the source of the prefabricated materials. Cf.   NLRB v. Enterprise Ass'n &  General Pipefitters, Local 638, 429 U.S. 507, 97 S. Ct. 891, 51 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1977)  (objective of work preservation will not protect  pressure leveled against employer with no power to assign work sought). The Court recently faced a similar situation in  NLRB v. ILA, 447 U.S. 490, 100 S. Ct. 2305, 65 L. Ed. 2d 289 (1980) , which  involved the ILA's "Rules on Containers," characterized by the Board as a "hot cargo" provision and by the union as a "work  preservation agreement." The Court remanded the case to the Board for further consideration, holding that the dispositive issue  was whether the agreement had the effect of preserving work of the sort performed by ILA members prior to the era of  containerization, and not whether the agreement would displace work performed by truckers and consolidators after the  introduction of containerized shipping. In the course of criticizing the Board's treatment of the case, the Court noted that, should  the agreement be found to preserve work for union members, it would not matter that it also generated secondary effects: "The effect of work preservation agreements on the employment opportunities of employees not represented by the union, no  matter how severe, is of course irrelevant to the validity of the agreement so long as the union had no forbidden secondary  purpose to affect the employment relations of the neutral employer."   Id., 100 S. Ct. at 2315 n.22 . In the context in which this statement was made, it reflects nothing more than a reiteration of the  accepted proposition that a union is entitled to engage in primary activity no matter how severe the incidental effects on neutral  parties.   National Woodwork Mfrs. Ass'n v. NLRB, 386 U.S. 612, 627, 87 S. Ct. 1250, 1259, 18 L. Ed. 2d 357 (1967) . It should be  noted, moreover, that the Court directed the Board to determine whether the agreement had "as its objective" the preservation of  work traditionally performed by union members by focusing on the "nature of the work both before and after (containerization)" i.

e., an examination of external facts and circumstances. It was nowhere suggested that the union leadership's subjective "intent"  to preserve jobs would save such an agreement that did not, in fact, have the effect of preserving work. The ILA boycott at issue  here does not have the effect of realizing any protected union goal.  The fact that the ILA did not engage in more extensive forms of coercion e. g., picketing or a total boycott of employers trading  with Russia or handling Russian cargo does not dictate the conclusion that its limited boycott had no proscribed object. See  NLRB v. Twin City Carpenters District Council, 422 F.2d 309, 315 (8th Cir. 1970) ;  Local 5, United Ass'n of Journeymen v. NLRB,  53 L.R.R.M. 2424, 321  F.2d 366, 370 (D.C.Cir.), cert. denied,  375 U.S. 921, 84 S. Ct. 266, 11 L. Ed. 2d 165 (1963) .

 But cf. the decision of the NLRB in  Local 1355, ILA and Ocean Shipping Service, Ltd., 146 NLRB 723 (1964) , reversed by the  Fourth Circuit in  NLRB v. ILA, 332 F.2d 992 (4th Cir. 1964) , discussed infra.  The district court also characterized the ILA action as "a primary boycott of Russian goods, with incidental effects upon those  employers who deal in such goods."  488 F. Supp. at 531 . Clearly this is not the case. The ILA boycott does not differ in this  regard from innumerable refusals to handle "hot cargo" that have been held to be prohibited secondary activity, e. g.,  NLRB v.  Local 3, Int'l Bhd. of Electrical Workers, 477 F.2d 260  (2d Cir.), cert. denied,  414 U.S. 1065, 94 S. Ct. 572, 38 L. Ed. 2d 470  (1973) ;  NLRB v. Wine Workers Union Local 1, 178 F.2d 584 (2d Cir. 1949) ; and cases cited at page 1375 supra. These cases  might likewise have been described as boycotts of a primary employer's "goods" with "incidental effects" on the secondary  employers that dealt with the goods.

 In response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the United States government placed certain restrictions on exports to the  USSR but did not impose any restrictions that would limit the importation of Russian wood products. See generally President's  Message on the State of the Union, 126 Cong.Rec.H. 20, reprinted in (1980) U.S.Code Cong. & Ad.News 112-13.  We also note that the ILA directive orders all ILA members to "express themselves" in a manner that may well be contrary to  the views of some. See Hampton Roads Shipping Ass'n v. ILA, Civ.No. 80-186-N (E.D.Va. March 1980), slip op. at 10 ("the  Union's position that its action constitute (sic) only the joint expression of its members' opinion… is neither factually nor legally  supportable. No evidence of a mandate from the Union's membership has been presented, nor did the Union make any effort to  notify its members or employees that Union members who wished to work or who did not support this action could ignore the  Union's order without fear of retaliation.") rev'd on other grounds,  631 F.2d 282 (4th Cir. 1980) . Cf.   Abood v. Detroit Board of  Educ., 431 U.S. 209, 234-36, 97 S. Ct. 1782, 1799-1800, 52 L. Ed. 2d 261  (union may not finance "expression of political views,  on behalf of candidates, or toward the advancement of other ideological causes not germane to its duties as collective- bargaining representative" through assessments paid by employees who object to advancing such ideas). Whatever the rights of  individual ILA members to refuse work as an act of conscience an issue we need not decide the ILA directive went considerably  beyond anything necessary to enable these members to assert such a right. See Truck Drivers & Helpers  Local 728, 119 NLRB  399, 407 (1957)  ("what is here involved is not an assertion of individual right by individuals, but rather the formulation and  enforcement by the Respondent Union as a labor organization… of a collective policy or program"). See also  NLRB v. Local 74,  United Bhd. of Carpenters, 341 U.S. 707, 713, 71 S. Ct. 966, 970, 95 L. Ed. 1309 (1951) .

Ed. 2d 26 (1975) , the predecessor statute of  12 U.S.C. § 93 , which prescribed the actions that the Comptroller could take for violations of the National Bank Act, was  construed by the Supreme court to give a private cause of action to a stockholder who suffered injury by relying on false bank  reports.

Opinion  Plaintiffs also alleged a violation of section 2 of the Sherman Act, but alleged no facts sufficient to make out a separate  offense. This allegation adds nothing to the issue whether an effect on "commerce" must be established under sections 1, 2 and  3.  The bank would seem to be the primary beneficiary of the policy; presumably the dealer is the purchaser of the policy because  the policy proceeds satisfy the dealer's liability to the bank for the remainder due on the car customer's defaulted loan.

 Memorandum by the Government of the United States of America concerning the Cessation of Transmission of Information  under Article 73(e) of the Charter with regard to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. Annex II, U.N. Doc. A/Ac.35/L.121 at 8  (1953). See generally Magruder, The Commonwealth Status of Puerto Rico, 15 U.Pitt.L.Rev. 1, 12-13 (1953). The memorandum  stated: Congress has agreed that Puerto Rico shall have, under that Constitution, freedom from control or interference by the Congress  in respect of internal government and administration, subject only to compliance with applicable provisions of the Federal  Constitution, the Puerto Rican Federal Relations Act and the acts of Congress authorizing and approving the Constitution, as  may be interpreted by judicial decision. Those laws which directed or authorized interference with matters of local government  by the Federal Government have been repealed.  See  Coyle v. Smith, 221 U.S. 559, 31 S. Ct. 688, 55 L. Ed. 853 (1911) ;  Moore v. United States, 85 F. 465 (8th Cir. 1898) .  The Puerto Rico Anti-Monopoly Act of 1964 (Act No. 77 of June 25, 1964) superseded the Puerto Rico Act of March 14, 1907,  and draws heavily on federal legislation. However, there are important differences. For example, the prohibition of restraints of  trade in the Puerto Rico Act is expressly limited to "unreasonable" restraints. But see  Standard Oil v. U. S., 221 U.S. 1, 31 S. Ct.

502, 55 L. Ed. 619 (1911) . The Puerto Rico Act's anti-merger provision extends to acquisitions by "any person", defined to  include natural persons and unincorporated associations, which were not included within the comparable provision of the  Clayton Act. The Puerto Rico Act's anti-merger provisions also exempt asset acquisitions which are for the purpose of  developing new local industries. There is no comparable provision under federal law. See generally Estrella,  Antitrust Law  in  Puerto Rico, 28 Revista del Colegio de Abogados de Puerto Rico 505, 580-709 (1968).  The application of section 2 of the Sherman Act to Puerto Rico is a different matter, for there is no comparable provision in  section 3 to the section 2 prohibition of monopolization. Whether section 2 applies to Puerto Rico following Commonwealth  status, when no equivalent prohibition applied before it, is an issue not before us and not briefed. Consideration of such an issue  would require, among other things, exploration of the reasons why Congress chose not to extend such a prohibition to the  territories.  We find nothing to the contrary in  First Federal Savings and Loan Association of Puerto Rico v. Hector L. Ruiz de Jesus, 644  F.2d 910 (1st Cir. 1981) . In that case, we held that post-1952 Banking Act amendments did not alter the scope of  section 632  of  the federal banking code,  12 U.S.C. § 632 .  Section 632 , enacted in 1933, grants federal question jurisdiction to district courts in  all civil suits involving "international or foreign banking, or banking in a dependency or insular possession of the United States "  where a federally chartered corporation is a party to the suit. Post-Commonwealth Banking Act amendments did not reflect any  congressional intent to narrow this grant of jurisdiction by discontinuing federal question jurisdiction in civil cases involving  banking in Puerto Rico where a federally chartered corporation is a party. And, Commonwealth status itself, although it  established the full measure of local self-government, did not necessarily withdraw this jurisdictional grant. Such a grant, in  contradistinction to congressional regulation of local affairs, does not threaten the balance between federal prerogatives and  local autonomy. Although there is not a parallel grant of jurisdiction over banking transactions in a state where a federally  chartered corporation is a party, that fact alone does not suggest that, as a matter of comity,  section 632  no longer applies to  Puerto Rico. Among other things, its history, language and mercantile custom may, in Congress' view, render Puerto Rico  sufficiently different as to merit availability of a federal forum for a federally chartered corporation banking there. Cf.   12 C.F.R. §  211.2(a) ,  213.2(b) (1979) ;  12 C.F.R. § 211.2(f) (1980)  (Federal Reserve Board regulations which define the terms "foreign",  "foreign country" and "abroad" to include the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico). Such a result respects the interests of both  sovereigns. Finally, there have been different historical understandings with respect to section 3 of the Sherman Act and  section  632  of the federal banking code. The Puerto Rico District Court held soon after Commonwealth status that section 3 of the  Sherman Act no longer applied to Puerto Rico, whereas that court and this court until quite recently assumed that  section 632   continued to apply to banking transactions in Puerto Rico.

 Pub.L.No.600 § 5, 64 Stat. 320, continuing in force section 58 of the Second Organic Act, and Pub.L.No.600 § 6, 64 Stat.  320.  The phrase "not locally inapplicable" originated in Henry Clay's Report of the Committee of Thirteen, the proposed  Compromise of 1850. As part of the settlement of the clash of interests sparked by the Wilmot Proviso (a proposed  Congressional ban of slavery in New Mexico and other territories), the Compromise was silent on introduction of the "local"  institution of slavery to these territories. The Southern view was that changing social and economic conditions (including  adaptation to dry soil) might bring about slavery in New Mexico, perhaps supported by retained Mexican law and custom. In  addition, the Southern view held that the territorial legislature should be free to recognize and support slavery even if such  territorial law thereby superseded general federal law dealing with personal rights. Of course, the North differed strongly on the  propriety of establishing slavery in New Mexico and took its chances on the dry soil and local sentiment. Thus, the phrase "not  locally inapplicable" was viewed by its Southern proponents as a means by which New Mexico, should it choose to do so, could  adopt slavery despite general federal laws dealing with personal rights. And, the Northerners apparently considered it sufficiently  ambiguous as to minimize its import. The phrase "not locally inapplicable" (and elimination of the Wilmot Proviso) expressly left  the issue of slavery in New Mexico to be determined by developing local social, economic and legislative conditions, and,  thereby, staved off the political crisis that enveloped the nation several years later. This history of the compromise language is perhaps of some continuing significance. Senator Foraker, in 1900, deliberately  chose this model (rather than following the simpler Wisconsin territorial act model "so far as may be applicable"). His choice  reflects, if anything, a more, rather than less, deferential view of the effect of local social, economic and legislative developments  on general federal law. In sum, the phrase reflects at least some intent that not only developing social and economic conditions  but also emerging territorial self-government could render general federal law inapplicable. Cf.   United States v. Ferrer, 613 F.2d  1188, 1192-93 (1st Cir. 1980)  (Puerto Rico has authority to enact local legislation inconsistent with federal maritime legislation).  For the history of the phrase "not locally inapplicable", see Congressional Globe, 31 Cong. 1st Sess. 944-48 (May 8, 1850) (H.  Clay); Hamilton, Prologue to Conflict, the Crisis and Compromise of 1850 89, 146-47, 204 (1964); Congressional Globe, 31  Cong. 1st Sess. 59, 72-73, 436-39, 461, 508-10, 567-73, 587, 592; Appendix 612-16, 902, 911, 1104-06, 1118, 1120, 1134,  1145-46, 1519-61, 1581-1630. The Wisconsin provision is set forth in Act of April 20, 1836, ch. 54 § 12, 5 Stat. 15. For Senator  Foraker's report, see Temporary Civil Government for Puerto Rico, Report of the Committee on Public Lands and Puerto Rico to  Accompany S.2264, S.Rep.No.249, February 5, 1900 at 5-6. On the Mexican law and Kearney Military Code as sources of New  Mexico Territorial law, see  Leitensdorfer v. Webb, 1 N.M. 34, 55 (1853) , aff'd  61 U.S. (20 How.) 176, 15 L. Ed. 891 (1857) ; see  also Rodriguez-Antongiorgi, Review of Federal Relations on the Applicability of the United States Laws in Puerto Rico  Subsequent to the Establishment of the Commonwealth in Puerto Rico, 26 Rev.Jur.U.P.R. 321, 343 (1957). On the use of the  provision "not locally inapplicable" in other contexts, see  Examining Board v. Flores De Otero, 426 U.S. 572, 588-89 n.20, 96 S.  Ct. 2264, 2274-75 n.20, 49 L. Ed. 2d 65 (1976) , and see also, e. g., 31 Stat. 141 (Hawaii), 37 Stat. 512 (Alaska), and  Shuttle  Corp. v. Transit Commission, 393 U.S. 186, 196  n.*,  89 S. Ct. 354, 360  n.*,  21 L. Ed. 2d 334 (1968)  (District of Columbia). For  another expansive view of territorial legislative power over "local" matters and a limited view of Congressional power to legislate  for the territories see Mr. Justice Campbell's concurring opinion in  Dred Scott v. Sandford, 60 U.S. (19 How.) 393, 513-14, 15  L. Ed. 691 (1856) . Finally, for a discussion of the scope of the exception to federal law encompassed by the provision "not  locally inapplicable", see Leibowitz, The Applicability of Federal Law to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, 56 Geo.L.J. 221, 234- 39 (1967).

 Whatever special considerations might move a court to hold that Congress did not intend section 2 of the Sherman Act to  apply to Puerto Rico, see note 31 supra, would also lead a court to say that the FRA was not "inconsistent" with the  nonapplication of section 2 or that section 2 was still "locally inapplicable". Again, all roads lead to Rome.  To hold the contrary in a price-fixing case, such as McLain, would undo years of jurisprudence making clear that a plaintiff  need only prove a price-fixing agreement, not the agreement's effects, in order to prevail. The cases cited by the Court,  American Tobacco and Socony-Vacuum, make clear that the Court had just this problem in mind.

The brokerage president stated in a deposition that many firms engage in reinsurance; but his deposition does not show that  defendants did so in this case.  Whether these allegations fit within the boycott exception of the McCarran-Ferguson Insurance Regulation Act,  15 U.S.C. §  1013(b) , was neither briefed nor argued.

Opinion Senior Circuit Judge of the Third Circuit, sitting by designation.  There is no merit to appellant's apparent argument that an August 1980 court order that it file an amended complaint denied  with prejudice a pending motion to dismiss.  The motion to dismiss was explicitly and properly renewed on October 9, 1980.  We  are at a loss to understand how plaintiff thinks that it should be both free to file repeated, incoherent pleadings and immune to a  motion to dismiss.

In the special circumstances of this case, we reject 9 to 5's argument that because the Board did not oppose the  National Parks  I  standard below, we should not now consider the Board's opposition to that standard.  Here we believe it will help explain our  construction of  section 552(b)(4) , if we discuss the merits of the Board's contention that  National Parks I  is flawed. As we  ultimately reject the Board's view and accept the  National Parks I  formulation, there is no unfairness to the parties.  As Justice  Blackmun observed in  Singleton v.

While Judge Breyer's dissent suggests that the BSSG's contract requirement that the information should be kept confidential  may be against public policy and thus, unenforceable, we do not understand the district court decision to rest on that point.

The separability clause of the distributor agreement reads as follows: "22. LEGAL INTERPRETATION 

--- 頁碼 196 ---
This Agreement is made in, and will be governed by and construed in all respects according to the laws of the Swiss  Confederation as if entirely performed therein, and will bind the heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns of  both parties.  If it is found that any portion or portions of this Agreement violate in any particular any law of any government  or governmental unit, division or subdivision having jurisdiction in the premises, and said violation would cause said  authorities to consider this Agreement as void and without effect regardless of the present election of law, then within that  political unit, division or subdivision, such portion or portions of this Agreement will be of no force and effect, and this  Agreement will be treated in any such jurisdiction as if such portion or portions had not been inserted herein." Article XII of the sales procedure agreement reads as follows: "XII -- STATUS OF DISTRIBUTOR AGREEMENT The Distributor Agreement remains in full force and effect between CISA and Buyer  except that the provisions thereof  which are in conflict with this Agreement shall be deemed to be in suspense during the term hereof,  and to the extent that  no such conflict exists, MMC hereby agrees not to take any action inconsistent with the provisions of the Distributor  Agreement not deemed to be in suspense in its relationship with BUYER pursuant to this Agreement." (Emphasis added.) Although the sales procedure agreement states that it is to be governed by Swiss law, the scope of an arbitration agreement is  an issue of federal law.  See  Acevedo Maldonado v. PPG Industries, Inc., 514 F.2d 614, 616 (1st Cir. 1975)  and authorities cited  thereat.  In any event, the parties have neither argued nor offered to prove Swiss law, and have not suggested that Swiss  contract law of general applicability would generate a different result.

Justice Douglas, in his dissenting opinion in  Scherk v. Alberto-Culver Co., 417 U.S. 506, 530-31 n.10, 41 L. Ed. 2d 270, 94 S.  Ct. 2449 (1974) , recapitulates the conference discussion of this hiatus and quotes G. W. Haight, a delegate to the conference,  representing The International Chamber of Commerce, as speculating that "courts may under this wording be allowed some  latitude;  they may find an agreement incapable of performance if it offends the law or the public policy of the forum".  (Emphasis  in opinion.) In other words, it could be argued that an agreement to arbitrate an antitrust dispute would, because it offends public  policy under V(2)(b), be, ipso facto, "incapable of performance" under II(3) and should thus not even be referred to arbitration.  As our discussion in the text,  infra,  indicates, we have taken a narrower view of "incapable of performance".  We remain  mystified, however, at the sense of, say, having to refer to arbitration a dispute involving the selling of slaves, knowing that an  award could never be enforced.

We speak here, as we have throughout this opinion, only of the enforcement of a  prospective  arbitration clause affecting an  antitrust claim.  We express no opinion on the question whether the parties can agree to arbitrate a specific antitrust claim once  the dispute has arisen, a practice that some courts have likened to the settlement of a private antitrust suit.

Hoosier's co-defendants are Stafford Springs Enterprises, Inc., Bristol County Stadium, Inc., A.R.C.  Auto Racing Club, Inc.,  New England Drivers and Owners Club, and Bobby Summers.  Throughout the opinion we refer to the co-defendants, except for  Summers, collectively as "the tracks and drivers." We include Summers, a Hoosier dealer, in the term "Hoosier."

HN3 [ ] The fact, as here, that the combining group is not drawn from people who compete economically among themselves,  is a further ground for rule of reason rather than per se analysis: such a combination is less likely to have been generated by an  anti-competitive design -- some other motive is at work which must be weighed against any incidental anti-competitive effects  flowing from the combination.

Although M & H was not selected for use under this single tire rule, M & H sold tires under single tire rules at several other  tracks in the Northeast during the 1982 season.  

--- 頁碼 232 ---
The fact of concerted activity by the tracks and drivers does not, standing alone, require per se treatment.   See, e.g.,  Turf  Paradise, Inc. v. Arizona Downs, 670 F.2d 813  (9th Cir.),  cert. denied ,  456 U.S. 1011 (1982) .

The district court expressly found "there was no evidence of collusion [ i.e. , between Hoosier and the other defendants] in this  case," although it felt the practices here "increase[d] the opportunities for collusion."  While the president of M & H estimated his company's sale of modified tires as $52,000 in 1981 and $250,000 in 1982, a more  precise estimate is contained in M & H's answers to interrogatories introduced into evidence at the end of trial:  M & H sales records are not broken down by geographic area or category.  However, by reviewing invoices, M & H has  calculated that it had the following sales in the Northeast:  Total Modified 1980 $207,051.88 $ 36,119.01 1981 183,226.05 52,965.39 1982 to date 

--- 頁碼 234 ---
 635,796.21 346,981.84 According to this estimate, M & H increased its sales of modified tires by sevenfold while the tire rule was in effect.  M & H's total  tire sales for the above years were:  1980 $1,816,109.08 1981  2,033,090.56 1982  2,066,766.90/August 31, 1982 There is no estimate for M & H's total modified sales worldwide.  These figures demonstrate that the tire rule did not prevent M &  H from selling modified racing tires, and the magnitude of the sales refutes any claim that the rule foreclosed any significant  portion of the market to which M & H sold modified racing tires. These figures strongly suggest that limiting the relevant market  to the four tracks that adopted the rule at issue here was clearly wrong.

--- 頁碼 236 ---
At argument counsel for M & H said:  If you decide that all drivers have to race on identical tires, and identical in every respect, you probably need something like  a single tire rule.  And the reason is that although it's perfectly possible to have very detailed specifications for the  construction of the tire, or the width, or the height, or the tire stagger, or the number of times you change a tire, or whether  you're permitted to use special left side and right side tires, those things, which are problems in this area, can all be  addressed by simple straightforward rules.  But if you decide in advance that every driver has to race on exactly the same  tire, you probably need a tire rule because as my client conceded and as most people familiar with this concede, the one  step in tire manufacturing, the compounding -- the adding of the rubber compound to the carcass -- is a sort of a black art.   And there isn't any quickly available tool to compare compound one with compound two as they come to the track. . . .  Specifying one manufacturer is probably the only way that you can ensure that everybody races on the identical compound. By the same token, if football teams and owners "combine" to change the rules of the game to eliminate expensive equipment  and generally to simplify the sport, we cannot conceive an antitrust violation simply because of the economic impact on  suppliers.

The record contains testimony which shows that Hoosier did not have a monopoly on being designated for use under tire rules.   The president of M & H testified that his company had been used as a track tire at several race tracks in 1979, 1981 and 1982.   The following testimony from the promoter at Seekonk shows that even at a single track different companies supplied tires for  use under tire rules in different classes of racing.  A The modified class was on the Hoosier budget slick, the 13-inch and the Pro-stocks were on a Hoosier 11-inch economy  slick.  The street class had been on the same tire for five to six years.  It is a recap tire supplied by Commercial Tire  Company.  The mini-stock competitors chose to use a used Goodyear.  "Scrub tire" is what they call it.  That is a slightly  used tire that was imported, used on formula racing, and it has been available through them at a much-reduced cost.  So I  agreed to let them stay on that tire that was available to them.  Q Now, sir, directing your attention to the Pro-stock class, when did you first institute a one-brand, one-tire rule in that  class?  A 1978.  Q What brand of tire was the designated tire in that division in 1979, 1980 and 1981?  A McCreary 9-inch slick. The record reveals that discussion of and experimentation with tire rules was a widespread phenomenon.  Not only were racers  in classes other than modified using tire rules, but such rules were considered as early as 1972 by various groups as one way to  control costs and increase parity.

Opinion Of the District of Rhode Island, sitting by designation.

At oral argument, we were informed that the Puerto Rican assets of Gulf and Chevron have recently been merged. 

--- 頁碼 266 ---
Because the plaintiff in this action is within the "core" of possible plaintiffs under  § 16 , we have no need to examine the outer  limits of standing under this section, and this discussion should not be interpreted as adumbrating requirements that must be  met by all  § 16  plaintiffs. 

--- 頁碼 267 ---


--- 頁碼 268 ---
We must also note that the defendants were not alone in disregarding the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Our review of the  record reveals that Caribe, too, was far from scrupulous in following the Rules. The cavalier attitude of the parties towards the  Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the court's orders cannot be condoned. 

--- 頁碼 269 ---
We note that, even if the defendants' late-filed affidavits are factored into the  Rule 56  equation, the calculus remains  unchanged; genuine issues of material fact nonetheless appear distinctly and in some abundance. One of the few facts about which the parties did not disagree was the relevant geographic market -- the island of Puerto Rico.  Some disagreement may exist, however, on the existence of relevant geographic submarkets.

The Sixth Circuit adopted summarily the Ninth Circuit's position in  Langenderfer v. S.E. Johnson Co., 729 F.2d 1050  (6th Cir.),  cert. denied ,  469 U.S. 1036, 105 S. Ct. 510, 83 L. Ed. 2d 401, 53 U.S.L.W. 3403 (1984) .

At the time his bill was called for discussion on the floor of the Senate, Senator Sherman identified the impetus of the legislation  later to be known as the Sherman Act:  The popular mind is agitated with problems that may disturb social order, and among them all none is more threatening  than the inequality of condition, of wealth, and opportunity that has grown within a single generation out of the concentration  of capital into vast combinations to control production and trade and to break down competition. These combinations  already defy or control powerful transportation corporations and reach State authorities. They reach out their Briarean arms  to every part of our country. They are imported from abroad. Congress alone can deal with them, and if we are unwilling or  unable there will soon be a trust for every production and a master to fix the price for every necessity of life. 21 Cong. Rec. 2460 (daily ed. March 21, 1890).  See generally  Katzmann,  The Attenuation of Antitrust , 2 Brookings Rev. 23, 23- 25 (1984) ("Antitrust reflected the deep-rooted and persistent American fear that concentrated private power could undermine  democratic government"). Senator Sherman explained: "The first section, being a remedial statute, would be construed liberally, with a view to promote its  object. It defines a civil remedy, and the courts will construe it liberally. . . ." 21 Cong. Rec. 2456 (daily ed. March 21, 1890).

The Supreme Court has noted a number of "instances in which Congress has regulated and restricted the power of the federal  courts to grant injunctions."  Yakus v. United States, 321 U.S. 414, 442 n.8, 88 L. Ed. 834, 64 S. Ct. 660 (1944) .  See, e.g. ,

section 16  of the Judiciary Act of 1789, 1 Stat. 82, Judicial Code § 267, 28 U.S.C. § 384, denying relief in equity where  there is adequate remedy at law; section 5 of the Act of March 2, 1973, 1 Stat. 334, Judicial Code § 265, 28 U.S.C. § 379,  prohibiting injunction of state judicial proceedings; Act of March 2, 1867, 14 Stat. 475, 26 U.S.C. § 3653, prohibiting suits to  enjoin collection or enforcement of federal taxes; the Johnson Act of May 14, 1934, 48 Stat. 775,  28 U.S.C. § 41(1) ,  restricting jurisdiction to enjoin orders of state bodies fixing utility rates; Act of Aug. 21, 1937, 50 Stat. 738,  28 U.S.C. §  41(1) , similarly restricting jurisdiction to enjoin collection or enforcement of state taxes; section 17 of the Act of June 18,  1910, 36 Stat. 557 and § 3 of the Act of Aug. 24, 1937, 50 Stat. 752, 28 U.S.C. §§ 380 and 380(a), requiring the convening  of a three-judge court for the granting of temporary injunctions in certain cases and allowing a temporary restraining order  by one judge only to prevent irreparable injury; the Norris-LaGuardia Act, 47 Stat. 70,  29 U.S.C. §§ 101-15 , regulating the  issue of injunctions in labor disputes and prohibiting their issue "contrary to the public policy" declared in the Act. Id. At the time the Clayton Act was passed, a split in authority existed among the circuits regarding the availability of injunctive  relief to a private party suing under the Sherman Act. Although the Sherman Act expressly conferred the power to initiate  "proceedings in equity" for injunctive or other equitable relief only upon the government, the Sixth Circuit affirmed a case where  the district court had granted a preliminary injunction to a private party pursuant to its inherent powers of equity. Through the  injunction, the court had forbidden an acquiring corporation to vote the stock of its new acquisition, and then, after trial, had  dissolved the injunction and dismissed the bill.  See  Bigelow v. Calumet & Hecla Mining Co., 155 F. 869 (W.D. Mich. 1907) ,  aff'd ,  167 F. 704 (6th Cir. 1909) . The Second Circuit, however, held that injunctions were not available to private parties under the  Sherman Act.  See  Greater New York Film Rental Co. v. Biograph Co., 203 F. 39 (2d Cir. 1913)  (by implication). These cases,  and the question whether inherent powers of equity were withdrawn from the courts under the Sherman Act, were discussed in  the committee hearings.  See  Senate Hearings at 629-31 (issue and cases); House Hearings at 485-87 (case), 963-64 (issue but  not cases). In view of these discussions, it is noteworthy that no exclusion of inherent powers of equity, or of certain kinds of  injunctive relief, was included in the Clayton Act. 

--- 頁碼 275 ---
The evolution of judicial powers of equity was a subject before congressional committee hearings on the Clayton Act and its  unsuccessful precursors.  See, e.g. , Senate Hearings at 1091-95 (witness Samuel Gompers); 1130-1163.

See e.g. , 51 Cong. Rec. 9090 (daily ed. May 22, 1914) (remarks of Rep. Mitchell); at 9169 (daily ed. May 23, 1914) (remarks  of Rep. Nelson); at 16326 (daily ed. Oct. 8, 1914) (remarks of Rep. Nelson); H.R. No. 627, 63d Cong., 2d Sess. 648, 652, 689- 90 (remarks of witness Louis Brandeis); at 666 (Rep. Nelson) (1914) (hereinafter House Hearings). See, e.g. , the discussions identified in note 10  supra ; House Hearings at 263 (Rep. Floyd); at 273 (Rep. Nelson); 331 (Rep.  McCoy); 51 Cong. Rec. at 15821-23 (Sept. 28, 1914) (Sen. Reed); at 15864 (Sept. 29, 1914) (Sen. Reed); at 15864-5 (Sept. 29,  1914) (Sen. Overman). As Arthur Corbin observed, a "word appearing suddenly, in empty space and with no history, would express nothing at all. To  be expressive of any meaning, all words must have a context and a history. . . ." 3 Corbin, Contracts 90 (1960). Injunctive relief had regularly been sought and awarded to private plaintiffs under state antitrust laws and in common law suits  alleging restraint of trade and price fixing.  See, e.g.,  Gibbs v. Consolidated Gas, 130 U.S. 396, 32 L. Ed. 979, 9 S. Ct. 553  (1889)  (price fixing agreement).

During the House hearings, a famous antitrust lawyer of the day, Louis Brandeis, suggested remolding the power to order a  "partition." Brandeis stated his belief that the courts already had this power -- the power to order the division and sale of assets --  but that it was doubted by some members of the judiciary, as evidenced by the  American Tobacco  opinion on remand,  see   191  F. 371 (S.D.N.Y. 1911) , and was not utilized as broadly as it should. Brandeis proposed that Congress "educate" the courts and  facilitate achievement of the antitrust goals by passing statutes specifically authorizing the use of this and other equitable powers  in the antitrust context.  See  House Hearings at 652. Other traditional equitable tools, specifically the injunctive power, were refashioned for the purpose of quelling labor strikes  and boycotts.  See generally  F. Frankfurter & N. Greene,  The Labor Injunction  (1930). 

--- 頁碼 278 ---
Evidently this perspective was shared by some officials in the Justice Department.  See  51 Cong. Rec. 15864 (daily ed. Sept.  29, 1914) ("The fundamental weakness in the enforcement of the antitrust act in previous administrations was the failure to insist  upon a real dissolution of monopolies and combinations which the courts had adjudged unlawful") (excerpt from Justice Dept.  letter quoted by Sen. Reed). It appears that over the years the legal meaning of the concepts "dissolution" and "divestiture" has become somewhat more  settled than in 1914, so much so that the Supreme Court has recently pronounced them to be to a "large degree  interchangeable."  United States v. du Pont & Co., 366 U.S. 316, at 330 n.11, 6 L. Ed. 2d 318, 81 S. Ct. 1243 (1961) . In  reviewing the Court's cases, we found that the term "dissolution" tended to be used when ordering a remedy for violations of  § 1   and  § 2  of the Sherman Act, but not for Clayton Act § 7 violations.  See, e.g.,  United States v. Reading Co., 253 U.S. 26, 64 L.  Ed. 760, 40 S. Ct. 425 (1920)  (dissolution);  United States v. Lehigh Valley R.R., 254 U.S. 255, 65 L. Ed. 253, 41 S. Ct. 104  (1920)  (same);  United States v. Southern Pacific Co., 259 U.S. 214, 66 L. Ed. 907, 42 S. Ct. 496 (1922)  (same). This was  especially true for the older cases. "Divestitute" of some assets or interests was frequently ordered as a part of the remedy of  dissolution,  see, e.g.,  United States v. Crescent Amusement Co., 323 U.S. 173, 189, 89 L. Ed. 160, 65 S. Ct. 254 (1944)   (Sherman Act  §§ 1 ,  2 );  Schine Chain Theatres v. United States, 334 U.S. 110, 92 L. Ed. 1245, 68 S. Ct. 947 (1948)  (same);  International Boxing Club of New York v. United States, 358 U.S. 242, 3 L. Ed. 2d 270, 79 S. Ct. 245 (1959)  (same). These last  three cases clarify that a distinction between the two terms was felt at one time. In  Schine Theatres , the Court stated: "The plan  does not provide for the dissolution of the Schine circuit through the separation of the several affiliated corporations as was done  in [ Crescent Amusement ]. It keeps the circuit intact in that sense but requires Schine to sell certain theatres. . . . Schine is to be  divested of more than 50 of its theatres."  334 U.S. at 126-27 . And again, our view that a "dissolution" tends to be ordered where  monopolies and restraints of trade are found, and has as one of its essential elements a major judicial reorganization of the  corporation, is supported by  International Boxing . There, the Court ordered dissolution of the combination, recognizing that new  corporations would be formed to handle the business formerly transacted by the combination. The Court further noted that  "dissolution might well have the salutary effect of completely clearing new horizons that the trial judge was attempting to create  in the boxing world, especially when effected  in conjunction with  the stock divestiture provision."  358 U.S. at 260-61  (emphasis  added).

Section 16 ,  15 U.S.C. § 26 , was originally § 13 of the proposed Clayton Act. Although most of the legislative history speaks in  terms of § 13, we shall avoid confusion by referring to the provision as  § 16 . While the fears and doubts of the minority are not an authoritative guide to the construction of legislation,  see  Schwegmann  Brothers v. Calvert Distillers Corp., 341 U.S. 384, 394, 95 L. Ed. 1035, 71 S. Ct. 745 (1951) , their report did comprise the only  specific explanation of the meaning of the private injunction provision that was readily accessible to the whole Congress.  Moreover, the Supreme Court has consistently favored the "presumably well considered and carefully prepared committee  report" over informal or casual statements made in the course of the legislative process.   Id. at 396  (Jackson, J. concurring);  United States v. Auto Workers, 352 U.S. 567, 585, 1 L. Ed. 2d 563, 77 S. Ct. 529 (1957) ;  United States v. Public Utilities  Commission, 345 U.S. 295, 97 L. Ed. 1020, 73 S. Ct. 706 (1953) . The Senate committee also sought to delete the exception for common carriers the House had provided in  § 16 , although it  ultimately failed to do so.

Representative Carlin then turned to clarify the relaxed standard for anticompetitive practices under the bill:  The Sherman law in its operation is limited to three things: First, a contract or combination in the form of a trust or  otherwise; second, a conspiracy in restraint of trade; third, an attempt to monopolize. There is nothing about competition in  the Sherman law. There must be actual restraint of trade under the Sherman law to bring anyone under either its civil or  criminal process.  Under this bill there has to be only a lessening of competition. Competition may be lessened without restraint of trade.  Competition may be lessened without attempt to monopolize. Competition may be lessened without conspiracy. It may be  the natural effect of the putting together in close relationship through a holding company of two corporations that are natural  competitors, or ought to be. Yet there would not be restraint. So instead of subtracting from the Sherman law, . . . we have  added to the Sherman law a most effective rule by which the actions of these combinations in the future may be  determined. . . . 51 Cong. Rec. 9271 (daily ed. May 26, 1914).

The author and prime proponent of the Senate amendment expressed his view of a dissolution:  Wh[at] I propose [is] that we shall have a real decree, that there shall be a real burial, and that we shall sod down the grave  upon the monster that was created in defiance of law, but that we shall at the same time preserve its parts and restore them  to competition and activity. . . . 51 Cong. Rec. 15864 (Sept. 29, 1914) (remarks of Sen. Reed).

Our belief that Representative Floyd's comments cannot be taken as stating a Judiciary Committee intention regarding the  scope of  § 16  is supported by an exchange between Representative Floyd and a later witness. Floyd stated during the hearings  on February 27, 1914, in reference to another proposed section "the purpose of these provisions as tentatively drafted. . . ." The  next witness that day then begins his comments by referring to that clarification and stating, "but as that point has been disposed  of by the committee, . . . it is unnecessary to discuss that phase." Representative Floyd responded: "I think it has not been  disposed of, Mr. Harlan. There are 21 members of this Committee, and matters are not so easily disposed of. I simply made an  explanation as one member of the subcommittee that had prepared the bill, as to my view of it. I would be very glad . . . if you  would state your views. . . ." House Hearings at 1049-53.

The Ninth Circuit explicitly holds this to be the House Judiciary Committee's view, and states that "whether Congress shared  this intention is not subject to rigorous proof."  I.T.T. , 518 F.2d at 922. But the opinion treats its view of the Committee's  understanding  cum  intention as that of Congress,  viz. , asking "whether by refusing to allow private 'dissolution' suits, Congress  also refused to allow private 'divestiture' suits."  Id. The problems inherent in that approach to statutory construction have been elaborated by Professor Brest:  [such an interpreter] must determine what the adopters intended future interpreters to make of their substantive views.  Even if she can learn how the adopters intended contemporary interpreters to construe the [statute], she cannot assume  they intended the same canons to apply one or two hundred years later. Perhaps they wanted to bind the future as closely  as possible to their own notions. Perhaps they intended a particular provision to be interpreted with increasing breadth as  time went on. Or -- more likely than not -- the adopters may have had no intentions at all concerning these matters.   Brest,  The Misconceived Quest for the Original Understanding , 60 B.U.L. Rev. at 220 (footnotes omitted). Although Professor  Brest's comments were directed to constitutional interpretation, they are equally appropriate here.  See  Appalachian Coals, Inc.  v. United States, 288 U.S. 344, 351, 359-60, 77 L. Ed. 825, 53 S. Ct. 471 (1933)  ("as a charter of freedom, the [Sherman Act]  has a generality and adaptability comparable to that found to be desirable in constitutional provisions");  NBO Industries v.

Opinion Of the Fifth Circuit, sitting by designation. The defendants in this appeal are the company and executive Charles M. Hartman. The jury found for Thomas E. Taylor, and  the district court granted a judgment n.o.v. for Gene E. Hollen. Electronic thermometers provide digital displays of a patient's temperature.

As part of its instructions to the jury on the elements of a cause of action, the district court stated:  "As I understand the alleged misrepresentations, and I interpret them from the complaint, the initial paper which instituted  this action, they at least are alleged to be the following." The court then listed the four alleged misrepresentations and the series of omissions described below. Plaintiffs objected to this  instruction, claiming that the evidence showed other misrepresentations upon which the jury could base a finding of fraud.  Although plaintiffs list a series of additional misrepresentations in their brief on appeal, they do not appeal the district court's  limitation to the four misrepresentations and the series of omissions presented to the jury. We therefore consider the issue of  whether the court properly limited the statements as outside the scope of this appeal.

Speculating on exceptions, however, would serve no present purpose.

In this discussion, we consider misrepresentations (2) and (3) as listed in Section I,  supra . The allegedly fraudulent aspect of  each of those misrepresentations is the description of the Arbrook thermometer, Survalent, as an "IVAC-type" thermometer. We  therefore treat these two misrepresentations as one, as did the district court.

To the extent that failure to reveal that Survalent infringed part of the Meditemp patent is equivalent to the failure to disclose  that Survalent had a pulse-counting feature, the alleged misrepresentation is covered by the alleged nondisclosure that we  already have concluded is worthy of jury determination. At trial, plaintiffs argued three bases for a breach of contract claim: (1) violation of a provision in the main contract stating that  all warranties and representations were true; (2) violation of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing; and (3) failure to abide  by the side agreement. Plaintiffs apparently have abandoned the first two theories on appeal. Plaintiffs seem to argue that defendants also breached a contractual agreement to return a "going business" to them. It may  well be that the provisions of the side letter agreement would be valuable to plaintiffs only in the event the Meditemp business  still was viable at the time of the reassignment of assets, but the contract does not assure plaintiffs that Johnson & Johnson  would be returning a "going business." The description of the events leading to the shutdown of the Meditemp business is drawn largely from defendants' brief.  Plaintiffs do not suggest that the significant facts are inaccurate. 

--- 頁碼 320 ---
These counterclaims were dismissed prior to trial. We suspect that plaintiffs' failure to prove a viable contract claim stems from their failure to formally plead such a claim. We  decline, however, to consider defendants' argument that plaintiffs should be foreclosed from making this claim at all, and instead  follow the district court's decision to consider the claim on the merits. 

--- 頁碼 321 ---
Although we need not address this issue in light of our disposition of the fraud claim, the interests of judicial economy  prompted us to dispose of it now rather than at the time of a possible later appeal. We do not consider defendants' argument on the amount of damages. In the event a new jury finds liability for fraud, it should  reach its own determination of plaintiffs' damages.  See  Gasoline Products Co. v. Champlin Refining Co., 283 U.S. 494, 500, 75  L. Ed. 1188, 51 S. Ct. 513 (1931)  ("Where the practice permits a partial new trial, it may not properly be resorted to unless it  clearly appears that the issue to be retried is so distinct and separable from the others that a trial of it alone may be had without  injustice.

All the subsidiaries were noted to be citizens of Connecticut.  See  Complaint, paras. 3-6.  15 U.S.C. § 1  provides in relevant part:  Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the  several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal. Every person who shall make any contract or engage in any  combination or conspiracy hereby declared to be illegal shall be deemed guilty of a felony. . . .

18 U.S.C. § 1962(c)  provides:  It shall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect,  interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through  a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt.  Although not raised by the district court, the complaint also is defective as to the subsidiaries because Odishelidze states only  that they are "citizens" of Connecticut and does not say where they are incorporated.  See   28 U.S.C. § 1332(c) .

Because of the view we take of the antitrust claim,  see  text  supra , we need not address the district court's intimation,  668 F.  Supp. at 97 n. 4 , concerning the scope of the "business of insurance" for McCarran-Ferguson Act purposes. We take no view of  whether or not that term embraces matters germane to insurer-agent relationships.  See  Group Life & Health Ins. Co. v. Royal  Drug Co., 440 U.S. 205, 224-25, 59 L. Ed. 2d 261, 99 S. Ct. 1067 n. 32 (1979)  (leaving question open);  Thompson v. New York  Life Ins. Co., 644 F.2d 439, 443 (5th Cir. 1981)  (similar).
