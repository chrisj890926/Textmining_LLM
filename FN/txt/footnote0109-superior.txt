Practice  and  Procedure §  4432 (2d  ed. 2002) This Court indicated at one point in its discussion that collateral estoppel would apply to those findings of fact that “support” the  nine legal conclusions. 10/10/02 Tr. at 5:5. Microsoft understands the term “support” as synonymous with the “necessary to the  judgment” standard used in collateral estoppel analysis, and uses the terms interchangeably in this memorandum. There would  be no basis under either federal or California law for deviating from the Restatement (Second) of Judgments' definition of  “necessity” discussed in Part 1I-A  [*108]   of this memorandum.  See also  the authorities cited in Microsoft's Mem. In Opp. To  Plaintiffs' Proposed Jury Instructions 21-22 & n.22 (Aug. 26, 2002). As shown in Microsoft's prior collateral estoppel briefing, under both California and federal law, the relevant issue is not which  findings were necessary to the district court's original judgment, but rather which findings were necessary to the Court of  Appeals' significantly narrower decision.  See  Microsoft's Mem. In Opp. To Plaintiffs' Proposed Jury Instructions 22 & n.23 (Aug.  26, 2002). 

--- 頁碼 194 ---
In addition to reserving all of its objections to collateral estoppel, Microsoft understands that issues about the formatting and  presentation of findings to the jury are not being briefed or decided at this juncture, but will be addressed after this Court has  decided which findings are necessary to the legal conclusions it has adopted.  See  10/16/02 Tr. at 53:23 to 54:18. See generally  Office of Consumers' Counsel v. FERC, 808 F.2d 125, 129, 257 U.S. App. D.C. 230 (D.C. Cir. 1987)  (citing  Restatement § 27 cmt.h  in holding that “[i]ssue preclusion applies only if the first determination was necessary to the judgment”);  18 James Wm. Moore et al.,  Moore'S Federal Practice, supra, § 132.03[4][a] , at 132-106 (3d ed. 2002) (“When … the court  makes findings of fact, but the judgment is not  dependent  on those findings, they are not conclusive between the parties in a  subsequent action based on a different cause of action.”) (emphasis added). Although plaintiffs contend that many of the findings “were necessary to establish Microsoft'S anticompetitive intent,” the Court  of Appeals held that evidence of intent “is relevant only to the extent it helps us understand the likely effect of the monopolist'S  conduct.”  253 F.3d at 59 . Plaintiffs never explain how evidence of Microsoft'S intent toward, for example, Lotus Notes,  helped  [*113]   the appellate court understand the likely effect of the acts found to be anticompetitive. 

--- 頁碼 195 ---
Given that Netscape rejected whatever proposal Microsoft made in June 1995, it is not surprising that the district court relied  upon these findings  only  in connection with the  aempt  claim that was reversed.  84 F. Supp. 2d at 32-33 (FF 87-89) . The district  court did not rely upon any of these findings as a basis for its monopoly maintenance ruling, stating only that the findings  provided “context” for Microsoft'S subsequent acts.  87 F. Supp. 2d at 39 . Findings that simply provide “context” do not support,  and are not necessary to, the Court of Appeals' decision. Not only was Microsoft'S June 1995 proposal to Netscape not among  the acts found to be anticompetitive, the Court of Appeals did not even mention the proposal in its opinion or rely upon Findings  of Fact 79-89 either as “context” or as an aid to help understand the likely effect of the to the Court of Appeals' specific liability  findings, Findings of Fact 79-89 do not support  [*117]   any of the legal conclusions adopted by this Court. 

--- 頁碼 196 ---
In her November 1, 2002 decision, Judge Kollar-Kotelly specifically cited one of those findings—Finding of Fact 129—as an  example of a factual finding for which Judge Jackson ascribed no liability,  224 F. Supp. 2d at 143 , and further stated that  Findings of Fact 115-132 “did not provide a clear basis of liability,”  id. at 163 n.68 . Like other findings discussed above, Findings of Fact 93-132 describe specific conduct by Microsoft that has not “been  weighed for competitive and anticompetitive effect.”  224 F. Supp. 2d at 138 . These findings are unrelated to the acts found to be  anticompetitive and do not support the D.C. Circuit's market definition and monopoly power determinations. Nor did the appellate  court rely on those findings as evidence of intent to help understand  [*120]   the likely effects of Microsoft's conduct. Rather,  Findings of Fact 93-132 describe in highly pejorative terms conduct that has not been held to be anticompetitive. The attraction  to plaintiffs of having preclusion on these findings is obvious, but so, too, is the prejudice to Microsoft lawful. 

--- 頁碼 197 ---
At the October 10, 2002, hearing, the Court suggested that preclusive effect may apply to the findings related to the tying claim.  See  10/10/02 Tr. at 7:11-18. This would be error and should be reconsidered. It is blackletter law that vacated liability  determinations cannot give rise to preclusion.  See   224 F. Supp. 2d at 258  (“Because the claim was not pursued on  remand,  [*122]   there exists no finding that Microsoft illegally ‘tied’ any product to Windows.”). Although Judge Kollar-Kotelly on remand rejected Microsoft's contention that the Court of Appeals implicitly reversed this  conclusion in reversing the district court's “course of conduct” liability determination,  224 F Supp. 2d at 99 , she did not hold that  Findings of Fact 230-238 supported the Court of Appeals' decision. 

--- 頁碼 198 ---


--- 頁碼 199 ---
The D.C. Circuit cited Finding of Fact 397 only in connection with its  reversal  of the imposition of liability for Microsoft'S  development and promotion  [*132]   of an incompatible JVM.  253 F.3d at 75 . Although Finding of Fact 398 refers to Microsoft'S  Java developer tools, the Court of Appeals held that the development of incompatible developer tools did not violate the antitrust  laws.  See   253 F.3d at 76 ;  see also   224 F. Supp. 2d at 144-45  (“[T]he imposition of liability for Microsoft'S Java tools concerned  not the tools' incompatibility with cross-platform Java, but Microsoft'S deceptive conduct.”). The appellate court went on to hold  that Microsoft'S “deception” of Java developers regarding those tools did violate the Sherman Act,  253 F.3d at 76 , but that ruling  was supported by Finding of Fact 394,  see   84 F. Supp. 2d at 106-07 , not by Finding of Fact 398. 

--- 頁碼 200 ---
These consumer harm findings were also unnecessary to the Court of Appeals' liability determination given the relaxed causal  standard applied by the D.C. Circuit, and collateral estoppel on these issues would be inappropriate given the sharp differences  in the legal standards and proof burdens for establishing injury and causation in the two cases.  See  Microsoft's Mem. in Opp. To  Plaintiffs' Proposed Jury Instructions 18-20 (Aug. 26, 2002). As discussed in the accompanying memorandum, Microsoft's position concerning the necessity of these findings to the Court's  legal conclusions is subject to all of Microsoft's on-going objections and appellate rights to collateral estoppel identified in its prior  written submissions and oral arguments. The Court has emphasized that Microsoft's participation in this process will not waive or  otherwise prejudice any of its objections.  See, e.g.,   10/16/02 Tr. at 55:5-6.

The Justice Department action is captioned  United States v. Microsoft Corporation , Civil No. 98-12322(DDC). The consolidated  case brought by a coalition of states and the District of Columbia is captioned  State of New York, et al, v. Microsoft  Corporation  [*153]  , Civil No. 98-1233(DDC). The State of Minnesota was a plaintiff in the latter case. These two cases are  referred to as the “government case” in this Memorandum.

In their initial memorandum, Plaintiffs sought application of collateral estoppel to 377 Findings. At the oral argument Plaintiffs  withdrew their request as to 16 Findings.

SACAC ¶¶ 49, 6268, 78, 84, 91, 99. The SACAC does not appear to allege oral misrepresentations by Defendant. Although  Plaintiff alleges that an E*TRADE customer services representative referred to Plaintiff's puts as "in the money," this statement  was allegedly made after the expiration date and is cited only in support of Plaintiff's allegation of Defendant's practice with  regard to the current market  [*17]   value of stock during a trading halt. (See SACAC ¶ 22.) SACAC ¶ 12. Occ Discl. Doc., RJN Exh. 4 at A. 14, original emphasis. SACAC Exh. 2. SACAC Exh. 3 at p. 51. OCC Disc. Doc., RJN Exh. 4 at p. 14. OCC Disc. Dock., RJN Exh 4 at p.

In  Piemonte , the Clearing Corporation's rules provided that an option holder could exercise the option only by causing his  broker to file a written exercise notice with the Clearing Corporation on the prescribed form on or before the fixed expiration date.  (See  Piemonte supra, 405 F.Supp. at p. 713 .) Notably, the Customer Agreement at issue in the instant matter similarly states  that "E*TRADE Securities has no obligation to exercise any option absent specific instructions from me." (See Customer Agmt.  at p. 52, Exh. 3 to SACAC.) However, the Courts must also accept Plaintiffs allegation that Defendant promised to automatically  exercise any options that were "in the money" on the expiration date, even if this could be understood to conflict with the  quoted  [*21]   portion of the Customer Agreement. 

--- 頁碼 224 ---
Besides alleging violation of the UCL's fraudulent prong, the SACAC also alleges violation o the unfair prong. However, this  claim of unfairness is based on "E*TRADE's misrepresentations." (See SACAC ¶ 73.) Here, the Court finds no  misrepresentation to support the claim for unfair business practice. At paragraph 22 of the SACAC, Plaintiff alleges that his E*TRADE account showed the value of his puts as $3,900 until the  day of their expiration, despite the fact that trading was halted. However, there is no allegation of reliance by Plaintiff on what  was shown on his E*TRADE account, and the allegation is not pled with sufficient particularity. (See  Lazar v. Sup. Ct. (Rykoff- Sexton, Inc.) (1996) 12 Cal. 4th 631, 645  [e.g., how, when, where, to whom and by what means misrepresentations were  tendered].)

Hershey Canada is the only one of the Canadian Chocolate Manufacturers that is a party to this appeal. Because we conclude that the District Court correctly granted summary judgment for the Chocolate Manufacturers, we do not  reach the secondary question of whether the District Court abused its discretion by excluding a portion of the Individual Plaintiffs'  economic expert's report calculating the damages caused by Nestle USA.

Several defendants also moved to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction under  Rule 12(b)(2) . After initially deferring ruling on  these motions, the District Court ultimately granted the motions as to Mars Canada, Nestle S.A., and Nestle Canada.

As explained earlier, we do not reach this issue because we will affirm the District Court's summary judgment.  See supra  note  2. A horizontal price-fixing agreement occurs when competitors on the same market level agree to fix or control prices for their  goods or services.

We illustrated the point well in  Flat Glass  by comparing the theories involved in  Matsushita  and  Petruzzi's, see   385 F.3d at 358 ,  and we summarize that discussion here. In  Matsushita , the Supreme Court criticized the alleged multi-firm, predatory pricing  scheme as inherently "speculative," so the Court refused to draw an inference of a conspiracy from ambiguous evidence.  See   475 U.S. at 588-91, 597-98 . In  Petruzzi's , by contrast, we drew more liberal inferences in the plaintiffs favor because the  plaintiffs theory—that the defendants conspired not to compete with each other on existing customer accounts—made "perfect  economic sense."  998 F.2d at 1232 . The only way for the defendants in  Petruzzi's  to increase profits in this manner was by  agreement. Moreover, this conduct of refusing to compete was obviously not procompetitive.  Id . The "strictures of  Matsushita  d[o] not apply" when plaintiffs use direct evidence to prove a conspiracy because "no inferences  are required from direct evidence to establish a fact," thus negating any concern about the reasonableness of the inferences  drawn from that evidence.  Petruzzi's, 998 F.2d at 1233 . Nor are these concerns implicated when there is "strong circumstantial  evidence" because such evidence is "sufficiently unambiguous."  Id . (internal quotation marks omitted).

An oligopoly is a market "in which a few relatively large sellers account for the bulk of the output." 2B Phillip E. Areeda &  Herbert Hovenkamp,  Antitrust Law  ¶ 404a, at 10 (4th ed. 2014). 

--- 頁碼 273 ---
Line pricing is the practice engaged in by retailers of setting the same retail price for competing candy products of the same  size. Given the practice of line pricing, the Chocolate Manufacturers contend that once one manufacturer raises list prices, it  

--- 頁碼 274 ---
makes sense for all to follow. If a retailer raises the retail price on all competing candy products of a given size in response to  one manufacturer raising list prices, the other manufacturers will suffer a decline in sales volume due to the higher retail price  and lose out on any increased revenue unless they follow the list price increase.  See  J.A. 1084;  see also  J.A. 1278 (Mars 2002  document explaining it would follow Hershey's price increase on kings because "the market would move to the higher price with  or without us"). This case is quite different from  Petruzzi's , where we said the economic evidence went "a long way" in meeting the plaintiffs  burden.  998 F.2d at 1241 . There the alleged conspiracy was not price fixing but instead an agreement to compete only on new  customer accounts and not to compete on existing customer accounts (i.e., competition ended once a defendant "won" a new  account). The industry (fat and bone rendering) was homogeneous, meaning the only basis for competition among the  defendants was price. The economic evidence in  Petruzzi's  showed a price differential between new and existing accounts (new  accounts were offered a significantly better price than were existing accounts), which could only rationally be explained by an  unlawful agreement  Id . Here, by contrast, the Plaintiffs' economic evidence is based on parallel price increases among  oligopolists without corresponding cost increases, a result which, as previously noted, is as consistent with interdependence as  with a conspiracy. 

--- 頁碼 275 ---


--- 頁碼 276 ---
Our decision in  Flat Glass  is not to the contrary. There we noted in dicta that evidence of a defendant's price fixing in a market  for original equipment manufacturer glass would be relevant to the claim that the same defendant also conspired to fix prices in  the market for flat glass, a closely related but distinct product market in the same geographic area.  See   385 F.3d at 377--78 . The  evidence in  Flat Glass  involved identical companies and one executive who participated in the price-fixing conspiracies in both  product markets. It is therefore consistent with the rule stated above because the people and companies involved in both  conspiracies overlapped. Nor does the standard we adopt here conflict with  Continental Ore Co. v. Union Carbide & Carbon Corp., 370 U.S. 690, 82 S. Ct.  1404, 8 L. Ed. 2d 777 (1962) .  Continental Ore  is inapposite because the relevant foreign conduct in that case was part of a  single conspiracy that "was effectuated both here and abroad,"  id. at 706 , and the Plaintiffs do not contend a single conspiracy  existed here. 

--- 頁碼 277 ---
We have doubts about the actuation theory and whether it unduly blurs an already fine line between lawful interdependence  and unlawful conspiracies, especially when the alleged conspiracy involves price fixing among oligopolists supposedly formed by  a tacit agreement. "[EJven when each firm rests its own [pricing] decision upon its belief that competitors will do the same," that  only shows interdependence, not a conspiracy.  Clamp-All, 851 F.2d at 484 . But because the District Court concluded that Dr.  Vellturo's theory was admissible and the Chocolate Manufacturers do not challenge that decision on appeal, we reject the  theory's application on its own terms. Dr. Vellturo's explanation of the actuation theory in his report drives home the point. There he opines that before 2002, the  Chocolate Manufacturers were unable to raise prices together. Posing a thought experiment, he says to "consider a scenario in  which U.S. executives from each Defendant with pricing authority for both the U.S. and Canada fly to a meeting in Canada" and  "[w]ithout ever uttering an express word regarding U.S. prices, the three executives agree to raise prices in Canada by 10%."  J.A. 2193. The thought experiment continues with the executives returning to the U.S. and monitoring the Canadian outcomes,  and then, without any further communication, one firm announces a price increase of 10% in the U.S. Dr. Vellturo opines that  under these circumstances, the "coordinated anticompetitive agreement in Canada has significantly changed the information  known about likely responses to a price increase in the U.S. by these same companies," with the price leader expecting the  

--- 頁碼 278 ---
other companies to follow the price increase. J.A. 2194. This thought experiment presumes not only that the conspirators in the  U.S. knew of the Canadian conspiracy but also that the U.S. conspirators are the  same people  as the Canadian conspirators. Moreover, at oral argument, counsel for the Individual Plaintiffs clearly explained that Dr. Vellturo premised his theory on  evidence showing "that the U.S. executives with pricing authority at a minimum knew that there was a [sic] joint conduct in  Canada,  [and]  at  a  maximum  directed  that  it  occur."  Oral  Argument  at  25:38,  available  at   http://www2.ca3.uscourts.gov/oralargument/audio/14-2790InReChocolateConfectionaryAntitrust.mp3. That being said, Dr. Vellturo backtracked in his deposition by asserting that the U.S. Chocolate Manufacturers' awareness of the  Canadian conspiracy was "not essential to [his] opinion." J.A. 2529. In that case, we acknowledge that the factual prerequisites  for this variation of the actuation theory—that the Chocolate Manufacturers monitored Canadian prices and communicated  (lawfully) with their Canadian affiliates—are satisfied. But under this variant theory, the inference of a U.S. conspiracy is tenuous  because the U.S. result of parallel pricing is perfectly consistent with interdependence.  See  Areeda & Hovenkamp,  supra , ¶  1422b, at 170 (noting that facilitating devices alone do not imply a traditional conspiracy because "any parallelism in subsequent  behavior will often be of the sort that can be satisfactorily explained by oligopolistic interdependence alone and without regard to  the facilitating practice"). To the extent Dr. Vellturo's opinion is based only on similar outcomes,  see supra  note 15, it is insufficient on its own to create  a reasonable inference of a conspiracy. "My father taught me... keep your friends close, but your enemies closer."  The Godfather Part II  (Paramount Pictures 1974).

A September 2005 email from Don Robinson, President of Mars Canada, to Robert Gamgort, President of Mars North  America, does not show that Mars executives in the U.S. knew of the Canadian conspiracy. In that email, Robinson said that "an  industry wide price increase has been rumoured for a few weeks" and reported the price increases already taken and being  taken by Mars Canada's competitors. J.A. 1395. Unlike the aforementioned 2003 Brown to Snyder email, for example (which  suggested that Hershey Canada contemplated a coordinated response to a Nestle Canada price increase with its rivals), this  Mars email does not include information that tends to show a Canadian conspiracy. Nor does a March 2002 email from Frank Higgins, Vice President of Marketing for Nestle USA, to other Nestle USA executives  show that Nestle USA knew of the ongoing Canadian conspiracy. In that email, Higgins reported on a Hershey Canada price  increase and promised he would "get[] more information from Nestl[e] Canada to assess the likelihood that they will increase  prices in the US." J.A. 7394. This email shows that Nestle USA monitored outcomes in Canada but says nothing of whether  Nestle USA knew the price increases there were the result of interdependence or a conspiracy.

The Examiner's counsel described it as "crude". Transcript of Argument dated August 10, 2017 (Tr.) at 27:22. The Eichmann Report is attached as Exhibit 5 to Hearst's Compendium of Evidence in support of, among other things, Hearst's  motion to exclude Eichmann's testimony. 

--- 頁碼 313 ---
Sillers' own testimony regarding his "analysis of costs" does not support Eichmann's assumption. In his declaration Sillers  described his analysis as "an analysis of cost" but stated that his analysis had nothing to do with the UPA. Plaintiff's Ex. 28 at 3- 4. In deposition Sillers explained that he parsed out the various expenses relevant to a print product per page and compared that  to an average rate per page to ascertain the level at which the Chronicle would break even. Plaintiff's Ex. 29 at 86:3-7 (omitting  the portion of the transcript containing the question), 86:15-24, 87:6-22, 88:1-9. This does not show Sillers was attempting to  allocate the costs necessary to produce and sell the FRROP advertising product as distinct from the costs of producing and  selling for example editorial content that is paid for by subscribers. Compare  Pan Asia Venture Capital Corp. v. Hearst Corp., 74  Cal. App. 4th 424, 426, 88 Cal. Rptr. 2d 118 (1999) . There are many ways in which to calculate costs, and the UPA's method of  fully allocated costs is only one of those.  Turnbull & Turnbull v. ARA Transportation, Inc., 219 Cal. App. 3d 811, 820-21, 268 Cal.  Rptr. 856 (1990) . Eichmann himself calculated that the Chronicle consists of 75% editorial pages and 25% advertising pages. Hearst Ex. Mat  98:10-15. 

--- 頁碼 314 ---
Plaintiff offers some tangential evidence in an effort to support the challenged allocation decisions.  See  Plaintiff Ex. 126 at  39:8-21 (print advertising priced to cover newsprint, ink, sales, salaries, and commissions and tried to maximize margin to cover  the rest of the operations), Ex. 134 at 32:18-33:6 (in newspaper industry, the pricing of advertising is significantly tied to  profitability). But there is no indication that Eichmann relied on this highly generalized evidence, which is not surprising because  it does nothing to support Eichmann's calculations. Hearst attaches the Rubinfeld Report as Exhibit 1 to the Declaration of Daniel L. Rubinfeld. Compare, Taylor v. Trimble , No B276723      Cal.App.5th     2017 WL 3187388 at n.15 (July 27, 2017 )  (expert opinion that does  not contain reasoned explanation illuminating why the facts have convinced the expert is not reliable), citing  Jennings v. Palomar  Pomerado Health Systems, Inc., 114 Cal.App.4th 1108, 1118, 8 Cal. Rptr. 3d 363 (2003) . Opposition at 13 note 5. Although not part of the Examiner's Separate Statement of Disputed Facts or responses to the Statement of Hearst, at  argument the Examiner's counsel suggested that Eichmann may have relied on the opinion of Hopson, Tr. 12. This isn't so. But  even had Eichmann so relied, there is nothing substantial to rely on. Hopson's opinion was that the "burden" of profitability is  carried by advertising. Tr. 12:8-14, especially at line 14. While this mimics the word "burden" from case law (e.g.  Pan Asia  Venture Capital Corp. v. Hearst Corp., 74 Cal. App. 4th 424, 431, 88 Cal. Rptr. 2d 118 (1999) , quoting  Turnbull & Turnbull v.  ARA Transportation, Inc., 219 Cal.App.3d 811, 822, 268 Cal. Rptr. 856) , it doesn't support Eichmann's allocation of 100% of the  Chronicle's costs such as ink and paper to advertising, or otherwise support Eichmann's use of the Sillers document and its  categories. The truth is that Eichmann simply didn't account for the fact that the Chronicle has substantial subscription income  which obviously contributes to the Chronicle's 'profitability'—he just 'puts that to the side.' Tr. 79-80.

It is especially critical in this case to note that IVs should be selected to deal with endogeneitv (or  'simultaneity') bias. because as we see below, the new IVs Eichmann chose didn't account for endogeneity. In their opposition, the Examiner's counsel announce their intention to justify Eichmann's use of his instrumental variables  (Opposition at 17:4 (caption)) but then proceed to discuss explanatory variables ( id.  at 17:20) together with the  Bazemore  case  which also only discusses explanatory variables.

Virginia Commonwealth Univ., 84 F.3d 672 . 676 14th Cir. 19961 (regression "must include all the major factors")  (emphasis in original);  Griffin v.

--- 頁碼 318 ---
This position is very odd. The point of a multiple regression analysis is to sort through a series of possible explanations for a  value (here, loss of Examiner's ad sales), testing whether one of them (here, presumably the downward pricing of the  Chronicle's ads) correlates, holding fixed the other explanatory variables. But noting only correlated downward pricing (as  between the Chronicle and the Examiner) without testing against other obvious explanations (such as industry-wide decrease in  ad revenues) just begs the question of the reason for the Examiner's losses. Some cases suggest that a party objecting to a regression analysis on the basis of a major omitted variable should run an  analysis demonstrating that including the variable makes a difference.  E.g.,  In re Live Concert Antitrust Litig., 863 F. Supp. 2d  966 , 974 C.D. Cal. 2012) ("There must be some indication that the excluded variables would have impacted the results");  Palmer  v. Shultz, 815 F.2d 84, 101, 259 U.S. App. D.C. 246 (D.C. Cir. 1987) . Hearst does not run its own regression analysis with the  omitted explanatory variables, but it did use Plaintiff's specifications but using Chronicle's quantity. instead of the Examiner's  quantity, as the dependent variable. Supplemental Rubinfeld Report ¶ 13. If Eichmann is using the right model, and if he's right  that there is a two player market, then his formulas should produce sensible results for both the Examiner and the Chronicle. But  they don't: they implies the patently bizarre conclusion that Chronicle's price increases lead to an increase in demand for its  product.  Id.

These were not the IVs used in Eichmann's original analysis, which used an improper data set. Hearst accuses Eichmann of  selecting IVs to rig the results based on his decision to change the IVs. Motion, 20. At deposition, Eichmann explained that  certain IVs no longer had explanatory power with the complete data set, but the new IVs did have explanatory power. Hearst's  Ex. M at 314:4-19. The Examiner does not otherwise explain the switch in IVs. 

--- 頁碼 320 ---
At deposition, Eichmann described the process through which he selected IVs. Hearst's Ex. M at 310:13-314:19. He does not  describe a consideration of whether the IVs were exogenous or endogenous variables. Instead, he suggests he chose the Ws by  plugging potential Ws into an unspecified test,  id. , that he never describes nor for which he states a source. The test may not  really exist. Rubinfeld Suppl. Decl. at ¶ 33. Hearst notes that Eichmann cited one source for the revised IVs: Rubinfeld's concededly authoritative textbook. Motion at  20:9-10. Rubinfeld explains that Eichmann misread the book. Rubinfeld Supp. Decl. ¶14.

Delta Brands, Inc., 387 F.Supp.2d 794, 812-17 (N.D. III. 2005)  (refusing to permit expert  testimony based on companies that were not properly comparable);  Washington v. Kellwood Co., 105 F.Supp.3d 293,314-18  (S.D.N.Y. 2015)  (distinguishing cases in which there is no evidence to support the yardstick comparison from cases where there  is some evidence to support the yardstick comparison, the weight of which is measured by jury). I reject the Examiner's suggestion that it is Hearst's burden to produce an alternative yardstick. It may well be that there is no  suitable yardstick, in which case the yardstick approach is not suitable. William B. Rubenstein, N C A  §  20:61 (5th ed., as of June 2017 update) ("For instance, the yardstick method can be a highly effective method of calculating the  amount of damage caused by a price-fixing cartel, but only if there exists a closely analogous market that was not cartelized  during the period in question. If data on such a market is not available, the plaintiff will have to utilize a different methodology"). Plaintiff also understood that Klein intended to offer an opinion on a fourth topic. In opposition, Hearst states that the fourth  topic raised by Plaintiff's motion is not at issue. Accordingly, Klein may not provide testimony on that fourth topic. 

--- 頁碼 322 ---
Plaintiff criticizes Klein for his failure to consider specific pieces of financial information. Motion, 12-14. But Plaintiff has not  established that Klein could not, as an expert in his field, rely on the information that he  did  rely on, or that he is required to  consider the information identified by Plaintiff. In the course of providing other opinions, Klein may assume that the Transcon sum is a 'contract termination payment,' if there  is admissible evidence to support that assumption.

Plaintiff's Response to Hearst's Separate Statement ¶ 6 (identifying only the Sillers analysis and the Eichmann report as  evidence of Hearst's fully allocated costs). There must be a reason to make an inference; without that, the inference is speculation and not permitted.  Minnegren v.  Nozar, 4 Cal. App. 5th 500, 507, 208 Cal. Rptr. 3d 655 (2016) . Speculative inferences—those that are "mere possibilities"—will  not save a party from summary judgment.  Yuzon v. Collins, 116 Cal. App. 4th 149, 166, 10 Cal. Rptr. 3d 18 (2004) ;  Collin v.  Calportland Co., 228 Cal. App. 4th 582, 592, 176 Cal. Rptr. 3d 279 (2014) . Accord, Barry A. Lindahl, 1 M T L : L L  § 15:21 (2d ed. June 2017 update) (prevailing rule in most states is that an inference must be reasonably  probable, and not merely possible). That is, this is not a situation in which we have two conflicting inferences, each of which is  permissible thus blocking summary judgment, similar to the situation in e.g.,  Lantz v. Workers' Comp.

If appellate division decisions are of "debatable strength as precedents,"  Velasquez v. Superior Court, 227 Cal.App.4th 1471,  1477,11 . 7 (2014), then superior court orders—and tentative ones at that—have less. But see,  Gateway Cmty. Charters v.  Spiess, 9 Cal. App. 5th 499, 50511 .3 (2017) (appellate division opinion has "persuasive" but "is not binding precedent");  Irvin v.  Contra Costa Cty. Employees' Ret Amin, 13 Cal. App. 5th 162, 220 Cal. Rptr. 3d 510, at n.3 (2017) ,  pet rev. filed  Aug. 9, 2017  (superior court order considered "for its persuasive value, unlike a nonpublished decision from the Court of Appeal. ( Brown v.  Franchise Tax Bd. (1987) 197 Cal.App.3d 300, 306, fn. 6, 242 Cal.Rptr. 810 .)"). Hearst also cites cases pertaining to "giving away" ancillary products in conjunction with products that a defendant normally  sells, in which case courts have considered the products being "given away" to be part of a package and performed the UPA  analysis as to that package.  See  Ameritox, Ltd v. Millennium Labs., Inc., 2013 WL 136210, at *4 (M.D. Fla. Jan. 10, 2013) . On page 5 of the same document the Examiner argued that third-party advertiser depositions would only be worthwhile if a  statistically valid sample of advertisers could be deposed. But the Examiner and its expert disclaim that approach too. Tr. 21:2-4.  See also, Tr. 20:22 et seq.

Compare,  Bay Guardian Co. v. New Times Media LLC, 187 Cal. App. 4th 438, 457, 114 Cal. Rptr. 3d 392 (2010) . The  presumption is also described at e.g.,  W. Union Fin. Servs., Inc. v.

Neither Sillers nor the individuals to whom he sent the Theoretical P&L testified with respect to its purpose.  See  Hearst's  Response to Plaintiff's Separate Statement ¶¶ 155-57 (undisputed facts regarding recipients of Theoretical P&L and their  testimony regarding the same). Other officers at the Chronicle testified that it was prepared in with an eye towards acquiring the  Chronicle.  Id.  at ¶¶ 158-60. This neither disprove or proves an intent to harm the Examiner's business, nor provides a basis to  infer either conclusion. "The intent or purpose of the below-cost sale is at the heart of the statute, and distinguishes the violation from a below-cost  pricing strategy undertaken for legitimate, nonpredatory business reasons."  Bay Guardian Co. v. New Times Media LLC, 187  Cal. App. 4th 438, 456, 114 Cal. Rptr. 3d 392 (2010) . The issue of distinguishing legal from illegal acts is particularly acute under  state law, because as contrasted to federal law, California's use of average total costs "increases the likelihood that a court will  find that the defendant priced below its costs, because average total cost is the most expansive economic concept possible for  measuring cost."

Perhaps especially in  antitrust law  we must be cautious in using inferences to dub illegal what is as likely legal conduct. E.g.,  Eddins v. Redstone, 134 Cal. App. 4th 290, 329, 35 Cal. Rptr. 3d 863 (2005)  ("Because the evidence is as consistent with  permissible competition as with illegal conspiracy, the evidence is insufficient to support the alleged antitrust conspiracy.  ( Aguilar, supra, 25 Cal.4th at p. 852, 107 Cal.Rptr.2d 841, 24 P.3d 493 .)"). E.g., Ara Jabagchourian, David Meyer, "Proving Wrongful Purpose Under the Unfair Practices Act: Plaintiff and Defense  Perspectives," 22 C : J. A . & U C . L. S . S . B. C . 40, 44-15 (2013) ("Absent such [direct] evidence,  proving unlawful purpose would most likely come through circumstantial evidence. One method of establishing circumstantial  evidence would include looking at the defendant's past conduct and demonstrating a significant shift in pricing practice while  showing a significant erosion in revenue or profits. A second method would be showing an overall purpose of harming the  plaintiff through evidence of other targeted conduct towards the plaintiff in conjunction with a below-cost pricing scheme. A third  method would be proving that the defendant was focused on plaintiff's pricing scheme and not of others in the same market")  The Examiner does not offer this sort of evidence. 

--- 頁碼 333 ---
While the order of burden shifting differs, that does not impact the ultimate result. Compare  Plaintiff's Response to Separate Statement re Interrogatory 32 (Defendant's Ex. 26) (no additional customer specific  facts re loss leader contentions).

--- 頁碼 335 ---
Plaintiff's citation to dicta in an appellate decision that was subsequently superseded by a decision of the California Supreme  Court does not carry weight. Motion, 16 (citing  People v. Pay Less Drugstore, 143 P.2d 762, 769 (Cal. Ct. App. 1943) ,  affirmed  by  People v. Pay Less Drugstore, 25 Cal.2d 108, 153 P.2d 9 (1944) . Hearst also argues, and offers undisputed evidence, that print advertising and digital advertising are at times sold in bundles.  Opposition, 13-14 (citing evidence). Hearst argues that in such instances, the bundle is the product.  Id.  at 13. If this argument is  correct, then the meeting competition defense is of no moment as to bundled packages, because the product in this case is  FRROP print advertising. 

--- 頁碼 336 ---
This does not necessarily preclude Hearst from using evidence of the rise of digital advertising as background for an industry- wide decrease in print advertising prices, with which Hearst was attempting to keep pace. In any event, Hearst's evidence in support of its defense is not specific as to whether the competitor is advertising via print or  digital media. Thus deciding this legal dispute is not essential to the resolution of this motion. 

--- 頁碼 337 ---
Hearst also points to Plaintiff's evidence of a sale made by the Chronicle at $3,000 per page as an effort to meet the  Examiner's prices for the same customer, which were lower. Opposition, 10-11; Plaintiff's Exs. 36, 86-87. In the absence of  evidence indicating that Hearst had knowledge of the Examiner's price at the time of the sale, this evidence does not support  Hearst's assertion that the sale in question was priced in an effort to meet the Examiner's competition.  Compare  Bergin Decl. ¶  14 (stating that the Chronicle understood that it "generally" charged the highest print newspaper advertising prices in the Bay  Area). Similarly, Hearst points to an internal document indicating that Hearst made a particular advertising sale at a price point  that was chosen because the Chronicle was negotiating the Examiner and needed to win the business. Plaintiff's Ex. 21. But,  again, this does not indicate what the Examiner's price was, including whether Hearst was aware of the Examiner's offered price  and/or if Hearst sold advertising below the Examiner's offered price. The truth of this general point is disputed. But, drawing all inferences in favor of Hearst, Hearst has established, for present  purposes, that it sold its FRROP advertising for the highest price it could obtain in negotiations with individual advertisers.

Imhoff v. Goin Reporter 2018 Cal. Super. LEXIS 4 * Core Terms Opinion 

--- 頁碼 342 ---
Defendants submit evidentiary objections to the declarations of Dan Montrenes and Dr. Charles J. Cicchetti, Ph.D. The evidentiary objections to Montrenes' declaration are sustained (Nos. 1-9). Montrenes states his qualifications as to his ability  to opine on the general practices of credit card processing companies and his experience in the field, from which he bases his  opinions as to how to ascertain class members. However, he shows no knowledge as to Defendants' payment processing  systems or what data they maintain (See Dec. Para. 7). His opinions are thus irrelevant and speculative. The evidentiary objections to Dr. Cicchetti's declaration are sustained as to Nos. 1, 3 and 8 as they constitute inadmissible legal  conclusions. No. 2 is overruled as his statement is based on his economic opinion of whether the 3% surcharge is a harm to  Defendants' consumers. Nos. 4-7 regarding his methodology for calculating damages are overruled as the objections are not  proper evidentiary objections but are disagreements on the merits of the opinion.

UFCW & Employers Benefit Trust v. Sutter Health Reporter 2019 Cal. Super. LEXIS 342 *; 2019-1 Trade Cas. (CCH) P80,742 Core Terms Opinion The parties refer to the moving Defendants as "Sutter Health et al. ('Sutter')." (Notice of Motion, 1; see also Opposition, 1.) 

--- 頁碼 382 ---


--- 頁碼 383 ---
Plaintiffs do not base their claims on any agreement of any kind between Sutter and other hospitals or healthcare providers.  (Plaintiffs' Response to Separate Statement ¶ 7.) Accordingly, the court need not discuss horizontal price fixing or horizontal  price tampering. 

--- 頁碼 384 ---


--- 頁碼 385 ---
The  Lathrop  court did not focus on any distinction between horizontal and vertical price competition. Instead, it underscored the  fact that one of the central purposes of the Cartwright Act is to promote price competition. ( Lathrop, 4 Cal.3d at 362-63 .) The point Sutter is making here is that Sutter believes that all three theories of liability set forth in Counts I, II, and III should  have been included in a single cause of action for unreasonable restraint of trade. (Motion, 23.) However, Sutter does not cite  authority to support its implied assertion that the court should remove valid and distinct theories of liability from the case because  they could have been alleged as a single cause of action. 

--- 頁碼 386 ---
Count II of the complaints is a separate claim for unreasonable restraint of trade in violation of the Cartwright Act. (See UEBT  Complaint ¶¶ 146-154; People's Complaint ¶¶ 148-156.) 

--- 頁碼 387 ---
Under  Section 1  of the Sherman Act: "Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of  trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal. Every person who shall make any  contract or engage in any combination or conspiracy hereby declared to be illegal shall be deemed guilty of a felony, and, on  conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding $100,000,000 if a corporation, or, if any other person, $1,000,000, or  by imprisonment not exceeding 10 years, or by both said punishments, in the discretion of the court." ( 15 U.S.C. § 1 .) Plaintiffs  suggest that the court should analogize their claim to a claim for conspiracy to monopolize under  Section 1 , which Plaintiffs  contend lacks a specific intent requirement. (See Opposition, 19;  City of Vernon v. Southern California Edison Co. (9th Cir.  1992) 955 F.2d 1361, 1371  [stating in dicta that a  Section 1  conspiracy to monopolize may exist even where one of the  conspirators participates involuntarily or under coercion].) This line of argument is tangential. Plaintiffs' primary argument is that  federal law is inapposite. (See Opposition, 18.) The reason that Sutter turns to  Section 2  of the Sherman Act is because it deals  specifically with monopolization. It is the strength of the analogy between  Section 2  and California law that determines the weight  to be given to Sutter's argument. 

--- 頁碼 388 ---
In re Cipro  did not only cite cases decided under  Section 2  of the Sherman Act. (See  Palmer v. BRG of Georgia, Inc. (1990)  498 U.S. 46, 111 S. Ct. 401, 112 L. Ed. 2d 349   [Section 1  case].) During oral argument Sutter suggested that  In re Cipro  is limited to reverse patent settlement cases. The court respectfully  rejects such a limited interpretation of the opinion. This conclusion is also consistent with Sutter's position that the claim is nothing more than a further theory that Sutter  unreasonably restrained trade. (Motion, 23.) At the same time, it is consistent with Plaintiffs' argument that a "combination to  monopolize" is analyzed like any other restraint of trade. (Opposition, 16-17.) To the extent there is nothing more here than a  disagreement as to whether the theory should have been pled as part of the second cause of action rather than as the third  cause of action, Sutter has not explained why this pleading formality makes a difference. 

--- 頁碼 389 ---
Plaintiffs submitted objections to evidence in conjunction with their opposition papers and Sutter did the same in conjunction  with its reply papers. The motion is denied because Sutter did not meet its initial burden, even if its evidence is considered.  Accordingly, the court does not rule on the evidentiary objections. ( Cal. Code of Civ. Proc., § 437c(q) .)
