The California policy of course differs from policies of states with different statutory provisions.  Twenty states have "right-to- work" laws that prohibit union security contracts.  (See dissenting opinion herein, footnote 7.) Ten other states have statutes  specifically requiring that union security contracts be supported by a majority vote of the employees directly involved.  These  states, all except Hawaii cited in footnote 4 of the dissenting opinion herein, include Colorado (Rev. Stats. § 80-5-6 (c), requiring  approval of three-quarters); Connecticut (Gen. Stats. § 31-105 (5), 31-106(a)); Hawaii (1959 Session Laws, Act. 210, p. 141);  Idaho (Code, § 44-107, 1959 Supp.); Kansas (Gen. Stat. § 44-809 (4), also included in the 20 states with "right-to-work" laws  and not counted in these ten); Massachusetts (Ann. Laws, ch. 150A, §§ 4(3) and 5); Michigan (Stat. Ann. § 17. 454 (15));  Minnesota (Stat. Ann. §§ 179.12 (3), 179.16 (1); New York (Laws Ann. ch. 31, §§ 704 (5) 705); Pennsylvania (Stats. Ann. tit. 43,  §§ 211.6 (1) (c), 211.7 (a)); and Wisconsin (Stat. Ann.  § 111.06 (1) (c) ). Six states not otherwise accounted for and having only a  provision more or less similar to  section 923 of the California Labor Code  reach a result contrary to that of  Shafer v. Registered  Pharmacists Union, supra.  (Kentucky, Maine, Missouri, New Jersey, Washington and Wyoming.  See cases cited in footnote 4 of  the dissenting opinion herein.) Of the remaining thirteen states, six have no specific statutes and of these three (New Mexico,  Rhode Island, and West Virginia) support the majority view in this case while three (Ohio, Illinois, and perhaps New Hampshire)  support the dissent's view.  (See footnotes 6 and 8 of dissenting opinion herein.  The New Hampshire case is unclear as to  whether the union had majority support.  That it had some support from the employees is clear.  [ White Mt. Freezer Co.  v.   Murphy ]  78 N.H. 398 [101 A. 357, 358] .) Of the remaining seven states, six apparently have not passed on the point (Alaska,  Delaware, Maryland, Oklahoma, Vermont and Montana); and one (Oregon) has repealed its labor relations statute and not yet  enacted another (Ore. Laws, 1959, ch. 55, § 1).  Thus, nine states without special statutes are opposed to the California  position.

Familiar rules for the guidance of a reviewing court in passing upon the question whether the evidence supports the  determination of the trier of fact that the situation presented to him does or does not constitute a law-defined operative fact (e.g.,  in Petri, the employer's interference with a union; in the next quoted opinion, an injury "arising out of and in the course of  employment") are stated in  Cardillo v. Liberty Mutual Ins. Co. (1947), 330 U.S. 469, 477-478 [67 S.Ct. 801, 806-807, 91 L.Ed.  1028] , as follows: "In determining [whether the legally operative ultimate fact existed, the trier of fact] . . . must necessarily draw  an inference from what he has found to be the basic facts.  . . .  If supported by evidence and not inconsistent with the law, the . .  . inference [of the operative fact by the finder] . . . is conclusive.  No reviewing court can then set aside that inference because  the opposite one is thought to be more reasonable; nor can the opposite inference be substituted by the court because of a  belief that the one chosen by the [finder] . . . is factually questionable.  [Citations.] "It matters not that the basic facts from which the [finder] . . . draws this inference are undisputed rather than controverted.   [Citation.] It is likewise immaterial that the facts permit the drawing of diverse inferences.  The [trier of fact] . . . alone is charged  with the duty of initially selecting the inference which seems most reasonable and his choice, if otherwise sustainable, may not  be disturbed by a reviewing court.  [Citation.] Moreover, the fact that the inference . . . involves an application of a broad  statutory term or phrase to a specific set of facts gives rise to no greater scope of judicial review.  [Citations.] Even if such an  inference be considered more legal than factual in nature, the reviewing court's function is exhausted when it becomes evident  that the [finder's] . . . choice has substantial roots in the evidence and is not forbidden by the law." The foregoing rules are normally recognized and followed by this court as well as the high federal court.  (  Hamilton v. Pacific  Elec. Ry. Co. (1939), 12 Cal.2d 598, 602  [5] [ 86 P.2d 829] .)

The fact that the Petri opinion was filed less than nine months after Chavez brings to mind the protests of Mr. Justice Roberts in  Mahnich v. Southern S. S. Co. (1944), 321 U.S. 96, 112-113 [64 S.Ct. 455, 88 L.Ed. 561] : "The evil resulting from overruling  earlier considered decisions must be evident.  In the present case, the court below naturally felt bound to follow and apply the  law as clearly announced by this court.  If litigants and lower federal courts are not to do so, the law becomes not a chart to  govern conduct but a game of chance; instead of settling rights and liabilities it unsettles them.  Counsel and parties will bring  and prosecute actions in the teeth of the decisions that such actions are not maintainable on the not improbable chance that the  asserted rule will be thrown overboard.  Defendants will not know whether to litigate or to settle for they will have no assurance  that a declared rule will be followed.  But the more deplorable consequence will inevitably be that the administration of justice will  fall into disrepute." And again in  Smith v. Allwright (1944), 321 U.S. 649, 666, 669 [64 S.Ct. 757, 88 L.Ed. 987, 151 A.L.R. 1110] :  The "policy of the court freely to disregard and to overrule considered decisions . . . indicates an intolerance for what those who  have composed this court in the past have conscientiously and deliberately concluded, and involves an assumption that  knowledge and wisdom reside in us which was denied to our predecessors.  . . . "The reason for my concern is that the instant decision, overruling that announced about nine years ago, tends to bring  adjudications of this tribunal into the same class as a restricted railroad ticket, good for this day and train only."

Alabama: The following cases consider title 26, Code, § 383 ("Every person shall be free to join or refrain from joining any labor  organization . . . and in the exercise of such freedom shall be free from interference") prior to Alabama's enactment of a "right-to- work" statute: A closed or union shop was a lawful object of picketing where the picketing union represented a majority of the  employes (  Hotel & Restaurant Employees v. Greenwood (1947), 249 Ala. 265 [30 So.2d 696, 703  [12], 705 [17]]), but picketing  for such object by a minority union could be enjoined (  Klibanoff v. Tri-Cities Retail Cl. Union (1953), 258 Ala. 479 [64 So.2d 393,  398]) . Colorado:  Amalgamated Meat Cutters v. Green (1948), 119 Colo. 92 [200 P.2d 924, 930-931] , affirming injunction of picketing to  compel an employer to enter into an "all-union contract" after a majority of his employes had voted against union representation;  by executing such a contract the employer would have committed the unfair labor practices of interfering with employes' right to  organize or remain unorganized (§ 80-5-6(1)(a)) and encouraging or discouraging membership in a labor organization, except  where the employer enters into an "all-union" agreement as authorized by the provisions (§ 80-5-6(a)(c)) of the comprehensive

Connecticut:  Lavery's Main Street Grill v. Hotel & Restaurant Emp. (1959), 146 Conn. 93 [147 A.2d 902, 905-906  [2-4]];  Kenmike  Theatre v. Moving Picture Operators (1952), 139 Conn. 95 [90 A.2d 881, 882-883] . Connecticut has a comprehensive Labor  Relations Act (Gen. Stats., 1949, §§ 7388-7399). Idaho:  Poffenroth v. Culinary Workers Union (1951), 71 Idaho 412 [232 P.2d 968, 969] ;  J. J. Newberry Co. v. Retail Clerks  International Ass'n (1956), 78 Idaho 85 [298 P.2d 375, 379  [4]], reversed because of federal preemption,  352 U.S. 987 . The  Idaho Code contains provisions (§§ 44-701, 44-702) like  sections 923  and  921  of our Labor Code, together with other provisions  like those of the Norris-La Guardia Act which were omitted from our code. Indiana (prior to enactment of a "right-to-work" law):  Roth v. Local Union No. 1400 (1939), 216 Ind. 363, 371 [24 N.E.2d 280,  282-283  [5, 6]], applying Acts 1933, ch. 12, § 2 (Burns' Ann. Stat., 1933, § 40-502), a declaration of policy like  section 923  of our  Labor Code, in the Indiana anti-injunction act. Kansas (prior to 1958 "right-to-work" amendment to state Constitution):  Binder v. Construction etc. Union (1957), 181 Kan. 799  [317 P.2d 371, 376-378  [2, 4]], applying G.S. 1949, § 44-803 (like  section 923  of our Labor Code, and also stating the right of  employes "to refrain from . . . such activities"), G.S. 1955, § 44-808 (employer coercion of employes in the exercise of their rights  under section 44-803 unlawful), G.S. 1955, § 44-809 (12) (such coercion of employes by "any person" unlawful). Kentucky:  Blue Boar Cafeteria Co. v. Hotel & Restaurant Employees etc. Union (1952),    Ky.    [254 S.W.2d 335, 338-339  [2]],  cert. den.   346 U.S. 834 [74 S.Ct. 41, 98 L.Ed. 357] ;  Hotel & Restaurant Employees etc. Union  v.  Lambert  (1953),     (Ky.App.)    258 S.W.2d 694  [1], applying  KRS 336.130  (Acts Gen. Assembly, 1940, ch. 105), which was rather like  section 923   of our Labor Code. Maine:  Pappas v. Stacey (1955), 151 Me. 36 [116 A.2d 497, 499-501  [3]], appeal dismissed,  350 U.S. 870 [76 S.Ct. 117, 100  L.Ed. 770] , applying P.L. 1941, ch. 292 (R.S., ch. 30, § 15), like  California Labor Code, section 923 . Massachusetts: Ann. Laws, ch. 150A, is a comprehensive Labor Relations Act. The employer's compliance with a closed shop  agreement between the employer and one not certified as the representative of his employes pursuant to the act would be an  unfair labor practice and picketing to enforce such compliance can be enjoined. (  R. H. White Co. v. Murphy (1942), 310 Mass.  510 [38 N.E.2d 685, 690  [9, 10], 691].) Apart from the act closed shop agreements voluntarily made have "always" been  recognized and enforced.  But a strike for a closed shop "is for an unlawful labor objective" and peaceful picketing for such  purpose can be enjoined. (  Fashioncraft, Inc. v. Halpern (1943), 313 Mass. 385 [48 N.E.2d 1, 3-4, 5] .) Michigan:  Way Baking Co. v. Teamsters & Truck Drivers (1953), 335 Mich. 478 [56 N.W.2d 357, 362  [4, 5]], cert. den.   345 U.S.  957 [73 S.Ct. 939, 97 L.Ed. 1378] , applying Stats. Ann., § 17.454(18) (C.L. 1948, § 423.17, as amended by P.A. 1949, No.  230), the state Labor Relations Act, which makes it unlawful for any person "by force or unlawful threats to . . . attempt to force  any person to become or remain a member of a labor organization, or . . . to refrain from engaging in employment." Minnesota: By Stats. Ann., ch. 179, as amended, a comprehensive labor relations statute, it is an unfair labor practice for an  employer to sign a closed shop contract without the consent of his employees (  Nemo v. Local etc. Board (1949), 227 Minn. 263  [35 N.W.2d 337, 341])  and apparently picketing to induce such practice could be enjoined (see  Starr v. Cooks etc. Union (1955),  244 Minn. 558 [70 N.W.2d 873, 879]) . Missouri:  Bellerive Country Club. v. McVey (1955), 365 Mo. 477 [284 S.W.2d 492, 500  [2]] ["the right guaranteed to employees  by  Art. I, Sec. 29, Mo. Const.  1945, 'to organize and to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing' is a  free choice, uncoerced by management . . ."];  Swift & Company v. Doe (1958),    Mo.    [311 S.W.2d 15, 21  [3]]. New Jersey: N.J. Const., 1947, art I, par. 19, provides, "Persons in private employment shall have the right to organize and  bargain collectively." This provision is not implemented by statute, but by the courts.  (  Independent D.W. Union v. Milk Drivers  etc. Local No. 680 (1959), 30 N.J. 173 [152 A.2d 331, 336  [2], 336-337 [3, 4]] [subject type of picketing by stranger union  enjoined at suit of freely organized independent union which had been selected as bargaining agent by employes at a secret  election conducted by a "Fair Ballot Association"; the court rejects defendant union's contention that "the judiciary [should] be  inert because it cannot provide a mechanism equal to the task of formulating and effectuating a fair pattern of labor-management

New York:  Goodwins, Inc. v. Hagedorn (1951), 303 N.Y. 300 [101 N.E.2d 697, 32 A.L.R.2d 1019, 1021]  [the Goodwins holding  as to federal preemption no doubt could not stand today, but such holding is not pertinent to our present consideration];  Wood v.

Laws, Ann., 1948, tit. 30, art. 20, § 700 et seq., is a comprehensive Labor Relations Act. Pennsylvania:  Wilbank v.

Waiters etc. Union (1955), 382 Pa. 476 [115 A.2d 746, 749  [3]], cert. den.,  350 U.S. 896 [76 S.Ct. 155, 100 L.Ed. 788] ;  School District v.

Building Service Employees Union (1948), 29 Wash.2d 488 [188 P.2d 97, 104, 11 A.L.R.2d 1330] ,  (1949),  34 Wash.2d 38 [207 P.2d 699] , affirmed,  Building Service Union v. Gazzam (1950), 339 U.S. 532, 538-539 [70 S.Ct.  784, 94 L.Ed. 1045] , applying an anti-injunction law like that of Indiana,  supra , and also stating that stranger recognitional  picketing violated "rules of common law";  Audubon Homes v. Spokane Bldg. etc. Council (1956), 49 Wash.2d 145 [298 P.2d  1112, 1115  [1-3]], cert. den.,  354 U.S. 942 [77 S.Ct. 1392, 1 L.Ed.2d 1536] . Wisconsin:  Vogt, Inc. v. International Brotherhood of Teamsters (1956), 270 Wis. 315 [74 N.W.2d 749, 753  [5], 755 [6]], affirmed,  Teamsters Union v. Vogt, Inc. (1957), 354 U.S. 284, 294 [77 S.Ct. 1166, 1 L.Ed.2d 1347] . Wisconsin's comprehensive  Employment Peace Act provides (Stat. Ann.,  § 111.06(2)(b) ) that it is an unfair labor practice and against public policy for an  employe individually or in concert with others "To coerce . . . any employer to interfere with any of his employes in the enjoyment  of their legal rights, including those guaranteed by section 111.04"; the latter section guarantees to employes the right of self- organization, collective bargaining through representatives of their own choosing, concerted lawful activity, and the right to  refrain from any such activities. Wyoming:  Hagen v. Culinary Workers Alliance Local No. 337 (1952), 70 Wyo. 165 [246 P.2d 778, 788  [6]], applying the  Wyoming "Little Norris-LaGuardia Act," W.C.S., § 54-501, like the Indiana and Washington statutes,  supra . Arizona (also has a "right-to-work" law): Rev. Stat. Ann., ch. 8, § 23-1322: "It shall be unlawful for any labor organization to  picket any establishment unless there exists between the employer and the majority of employees of such establishment a bona  fide dispute regarding wages or working conditions." Colorado:  Section 6(2)(e) of the Labor  Peace Act (Rev. Stats., ch. 80, art. 5, §§ 1-22) made a strike vote by a majority of the  employes of the subject employer a condition precedent of picketing, and  section 7(2)  provided that the strike vote be taken "as  is provided in this act." These sections were held inoperative because the only provision in "this act" for a strike vote was in  section 20, which in turn was held unconstitutional because it required incorporation of unions.  (  American Federation of Labor  v. Reilly (1944), 113 Colo. 90 [155 P.2d 145, 150  [9, 10],  160 A.L.R. 873] .) Hawaii: Rev. Laws, 1955, ch. 90, is a comprehensive Employment Relations Act.  Section 90-8(e) provides that it is an unfair  labor practice for an employe "To cooperate in engaging in, promoting or inducing picketing (not constituting an exercise of  constitutionally guaranteed freedom of speech) . . . unless a majority in a collective bargaining unit of the employees of an  employer against whom such acts are primarily directed have voted by secret ballot to call a strike." Minnesota: Stat. Ann., § 179.11(4)  provides that it is an unfair labor practice "For any person to picket or cause to be picketed a  place of employment of which place the person is not an employee while a strike is in progress affecting the place of

employment, unless the majority of persons engaged in picketing the place of employment at these times are employees of the  place of employment." Montana has a rather unusual statute (Rev. Code Ann., § 41-1801; L. 1959, ch. 160, § 1) which provides that "a sole proprietor  or a member of a partnership consisting of not more than two partners who own a retail or amusement establishment and the  members of his immediate family shall have the right to do any work in his place of business without interference by any union or  any member thereof." Oregon: Rev. Stats., 1953, ch. 662, §§ .610 through .790, a comprehensive labor code, specifically provides (§ .750) that "It  shall be unlawful for any person directly or indirectly to . . . coerce . . . any employee in the exercise of said employee's free  choice in selecting or rejecting a labor organization as the representative of employees for the purpose of collective bargaining,  or . . . to coerce . . . any employer or employee because employees of said employer . . . have not selected a labor organization  as their representative for said purpose.  The word 'coerce' includes picketing." The constitutionality of this provision was upheld  in  Gilbertson v. Culinary Alliance & Bartenders' Union (1955), 204 Ore. 326 [282 P.2d 632, 652-653  [15-18]]. Pennsylvania: The state Labor Relations Act (Act of 1947, No. 484) provided that it is a union unfair labor practice for a labor  organization or employes "To picket or cause to be picketed a place of employment by a person . . . who is not . . . an employee  . . . of the place of employment." (Purdon's Stats. Ann., tit. 43, § 211.6(2)(d).) This statute was held an unconstitutional restraint  on freedom of speech because its broad prohibition of picketing by nonemployes "leaves room for no exceptions based upon the  lawfulness of the purpose of the picketing, its peaceful character, or the circumstances that the picketers have a legitimate  economic interest to advance thereby." (  Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board v. Chester & Del. etc. Union (1949), 361 Pa. 246  [64 A.2d 834, 841  [3]].) Texas (which has a "right-to-work" law) also sought to narrowly restrict peaceful picketing by the following provisions of Vernon's  Ann. Civ. Stat., art. 5154f: "It shall be unlawful for any person . . . to . . . participate in, aid or abet . . . secondary picketing . . . as  those terms are defined herein"; i.e., "the act of establishing a picket . . . near the premises of any employer where no labor  dispute, as that term is defined in this Act, exists between such employer and his employees.  . . .  The term 'labor dispute' is  limited to . . . any controversy between an employer and the majority of his employees concerning wages, hours or conditions of  employment; provided that if any of the employees are members of a labor union, a controversy between such employer and a  majority of the employees belonging to such union, concerning wages, hours or conditions of employment, shall be deemed, as  to the employee members only of such union, a labor dispute within the meaning of this Act." In  International Union of  Operating Engineers v. Cox (1949), 148 Tex. 42 [219 S.W.2d 787, 793  [10-12]], it was held that the foregoing statutory  definitions were so narrow as to constitute an unconstitutional deprivation of free speech, but the right to impose reasonable  restrictions on peaceful picketing was recognized.

Rhode Island: The comprehensive state Labor Relations Act, Gen. Laws, tit. 28, ch. 7 (P. L. 1941, ch. 1066) resembles the  Wagner Act (pre-Taft-Hartley).  Section 28-7-2 thereof declares the public policy of self-organization and collective bargaining of  employes through representatives of their own choosing "free from the interference, restraint or coercion of their employers" (§  1) and provides that the act shall not be construed to diminish the right of employes to engage in "lawful, concerted activities."  According to  Lindsey Tavern v. Hotel & Restaurant Employees (1956), 85 R.I. 61 [125 A.2d 207, 209, 210  [4]], recognitional  picketing, "unaccompanied by coercion, duress or intimidation, is lawful, . . . even if the picketing union represents no employees  of the complainant." West Virginia:  Blossom Dairy Co. v. International Brotherhood (1942), 125 W.Va. 165 [23 S.E.2d 645, 649] , where no statute is  involved, holds (Syllabus 1 by the court, p. 646 of 23 S.E.2d) that "Picketing of the place of business of an employer by a labor  union will not be enjoined on the ground that it tends, or is intended, to cause the breach of a labor contract between such  employer and another labor organization, when such picketing is not otherwise unlawful." Nevada (prior to enactment in 1953 of a "right-to-work" law) may also be mentioned here:  State  ex rel.   Culinary v. Eighth  Judicial District Court (1949), 66 Nev. 166 [207 P.2d 990, 996-998  [10-12]], upheld the legality of picketing by an outside union  to compel a closed shop agreement under N.C.L., § 10473 (enacted 1911), which provided that "It shall be unlawful for any  person . . . to make . . . any agreement . . . by the terms of which any employee of such person, . . . or any person about to enter  the employ of such person, . . . as a condition for continuing or obtaining such employment, shall promise or agree not to  become or continue . . ., or . . . to become or continue a member of a labor organization," and N.C.L., § 2825.31 (approved  1937), a statutory declaration of policy substantially identical with  section 923  of our Labor Code. Prior to its 1959 amendment  section 8 of the Labor  Management Relations Act of 1947, as amended ( 29 U.S.C. § 158 ),  contained among the proscribed unfair labor practices (largely the same as those which, prior to the recent majority decision in  the Petri Cleaners case were proscribed in California by  Labor Code, section 923 , and related sections) the following which are  here pertinent: "(b) It shall be an unfair labor practice for a labor organization or its agents: "(1) to restrain or coerce (A) employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in  section 7  [i.e., rights to self-organization, to  bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, etc., and also to refrain from such activities except as the  latter right may be affected by a union security agreement as authorized in section 8(a)(3)] . . . "(2) to cause or attempt to cause an employer to discriminate against an employee in violation of subsection (a)(3) [which  provides that it is an unfair labor practice for an employer to discriminate in regard to employment to encourage or discourage  membership in any labor organization, except that the employer can enter into a union security agreement as authorized by the  act] . . . "(4) to engage in, or to induce or encourage the employees of any employer to engage in, a strike or a concerted refusal in the  course of their employment to . . . work on any . . . commodities or to perform any services, where an object thereof is: . . . (C)  forcing . . . any employer to recognize or bargain with a particular labor organization as the representative of his employees if  another labor organization has been certified . . ." The 1959 act adds a new union unfair labor practice to section 8(b); i.e., "(7) to picket or cause to be picketed . . . any  employer where an object thereof is forcing or requiring an employer to recognize or bargain with a labor organization as the  

--- 頁碼 28 ---
representative of his employees . . . unless such labor organization is currently certified as the representative of such  employees:" (A) where the employer has lawfully recognized another union and a question concerning representation may not appropriately  be raised under the act. (B) where a valid representation election has been conducted in the preceding 12 months. (C) where the picketing has been conducted without a representation petition being filed with the board "within a reasonable  period of time not to exceed thirty days from the commencement of such picketing," with some provisos. "Nothing in this paragraph (7) shall be construed to permit any act which would otherwise be an unfair labor practice under this  section (8)(b)." " Section 13 provides: "'Nothing in this Act, except as specifically provided for herein, shall be construed so as either to interfere with or impede or  diminish in any way the right to strike, or to affect the limitations or qualifications on that right.' 61 Stat. 151,  29 U.S.C. § 163 . "Picketing has been equated with striking for the purposes of § 13.  [Citations.]"

The essence of the majority's holding (pp. 886-887,  ante ) is that "the point of clause thirteen [of the demanded contract] is not  price-fixing, but wage-fixing, and the presence of employer-barbers in the union does not convert the contract into an agreement  between labor groups and non-labor groups for the purpose of restraining trade."

Among the provisions of the International's constitution are the following: Article III, section 1: "The General Executive Board of the International Union is authorized to grant charters to local unions or  employers' guilds . . . "Sec. 3. In places where more than one union holds a charter, said unions and guilds shall form a joint committee to regulate  prices, wages, hours of labor and other working conditions.  . . ." Article VII,  section 6 : "No Shop recognized as a union shop . . . shall permit the following unfair trade practices: . . .  4. The  rendering of any service in the trade area thereof for less than the minimum prices established in said trade area . . . "Sec. 11. . . .  Copies of the working agreement setting forth prices, wages and hours and other working conditions shall be  signed by the owner or operator signing the Shop Card agreement . . . "Sec. 12. The contract, or agreement, called for by these laws shall be so construed that the person . . . displaying the Shop  Card shall specifically agree: . . .  (b) To abide by the laws of the local union . . . with reference to prices, hours, wages, and  working conditions.  . . ." Article XV, section 1. "Every local union or guild may make its own by-laws, which must, however, be in accordance with this  Constitution.  . . . "Sec. 5. Every local union shall regulate the hours of labor, prices and wages in their respective locality . . ."

Pertinent here is the view taken by the NLRB in making a cease and desist order as to conduct which it determined was a  Taft-Hartley-defined unfair labor practice, and by the United States Supreme Court in upholding the board's determination, in  National Labor Relations Board v. Denver Bldg. & Const. Trades Council (1951), 341 U.S. 675, 688, 689 [71 S.Ct. 943, 95 L.Ed.  1284] . The board found "That  an  object, if not the only object, of what transpired" was the proscribed unfair labor practice; the  high court accepted this finding and held that "It is not necessary to find that the  sole  object of the strike was that [proscribed by  the national act]."

Id.—Demurrer to Complaint—Matters Not Admitted.  Opinion The "fourth amended complaint" was amended by plaintiffs prior to attack thereon.  As denoted herein, the "fourth amended  complaint" is the fourth amended complaint as amended.  The general demurrers were sustained and motions to strike granted  as to various groups of defendants as parenthetically indicated: (1) Great Western Financial Corporation, Great Western  Savings and Loan Association and 25 individual escrow companies referred to herein as Liberty Escrow (general demurrer  sustained without leave to amend as to each count alleged, motion to strike complaint granted); (2) Sherwood Escrow Co., and  Summit Title Company (general demurrer sustained without leave to amend as to each count alleged upon representations that  no further facts could be added, motion to strike granted as to 10 specifications and denied as to 5 specifications); (3) American  Title Company (general demurrer sustained without leave to amend as to each count alleged); (4) Security Title Insurance  Company and Financial Corp. of America (demurrer of Financial Corp. sustained without leave to amend, general demurrer of  Security Title Insurance sustained without leave to amend as to each count alleged upon representations that no further facts  can be added, motion to strike granted as to 17 of 78 paragraphs); (5) Lehman Brothers (general demurrer sustained without  leave to amend as to each count, motion to strike granted).

Brackets together, in this manner []  without enclosing material , are used to indicate deletions from the opinion of the Court of  Appeal; brackets  enclosing material  (other than editor's added parallel citations) are, unless otherwise indicated, used to denote  insertions or additions by this court.  We thus avoid the extension of quotation marks within quotation marks, which would be  incident to the use of such conventional punctuation, and at the same time accurately indicate the matter quoted.  In so doing,  we adhere to a method of adoption employed by us in the past.  (  People v. Lyons (1956) 47 Cal.2d 311, 314, fn. 1 [303 P.2d  329] ;  Simmons v. Civil Service Emp. Ins. Co. (1962) 57 Cal.2d 381, 383, fn. 1 [19 Cal.Rptr. 662, 369 P.2d 262] ;  Eye Dog  Foundation v. State Board of Guide Dogs for the Blind (1967) 67 Cal.2d 536, 540, fn. 1 [63 Cal.Rptr. 21, 432 P.2d 717] ;  Smith v.  Anderson (1967) 67 Cal.2d 635, 637, fn. 1 [63 Cal.Rptr. 391, 433 P.2d 183] ;  Continental Baking Co. v. Katz (1968) 68 Cal.2d  512, 517, fn. 3 [67 Cal.Rptr. 761, 439 P.2d 889] .) On the record presented we are unable to evaluate the motions to dismiss granted by the trial court as to various defendants.   Our examination of the record available persuades us that in major part the motions were granted on the ground that plaintiffs  had consistently failed to allege factual matters with the particularity required to sustain a cause of action under the Cartwright  Act and other acts on which plaintiffs relied.  Accordingly, motions to dismiss all or portions of plaintiffs' fourth amended  complaint were granted as to various defendants on grounds which appear to be related to those for sustaining the general  demurrers. Although the instant record does not fully advise us of matters identical to those in  Lavine v. Jessup (1957) 48 Cal.2d  611 [311 P.2d 8] , plaintiffs assert that a "duplicate situation" exists.  The following observations from that case are pertinent  here: "This case presents an unusual situation in that the court simultaneously sustained general demurrers without leave to  amend and granted motions to strike the complaint as sham and to dismiss the action.  The motions were not supported by  affidavits setting up any extrinsic matters and obviously were made upon the assumption that the complaint failed to state a  cause of action and was merely repetitious of prior complaints which had been ruled insufficient.  Defendants thus made their  challenge solely on the fact of the pleadings, and it seems clear that the questions presented by the motions were identically the  same as those presented by the demurrers, i.e., did the complaint state a cause of action and, if not, could the defects be cured  by amendment.  The normal method of resolving such issues in favor of a defendant is by ruling upon a demurrer and thereafter  rendering a judgment based upon the ruling.  It is, of course, unnecessary for the court, in addition, to grant a motion to dismiss.   As we have seen, the court subsequently signed and filed a judgment of dismissal which, after reciting that the demurrers had  been sustained and the motions had been granted, adjudged that the action be dismissed." ( 48 Cal.2d at p. 614 .) As indicated,  the court equated the  Lavine  order granting the motion to dismiss with the order sustaining the general demurrer. [For the foregoing reasons we do not pass upon the merits of the motions to dismiss or the propriety of the orders thereon as  raising independent issues.]

Some authorities draw precise distinctions among the several expressions.  "Bid chiseling" is limited to the practice of a general  contractor who solicits lower sub-bids after he has been awarded the prime contract.  "Bid shopping" is used to refer to such  solicitation by general contractors before the award of the prime contract.  And "bid peddling" applies to the conduct of a  subcontractor. (See  People v. Inland Bid Depository (1965) 233 Cal.App.2d 851, 863-864 [44 Cal.Rptr. 206] ; Comment (1970)  18 U.C.L.A. L.Rev. 389, 394 .) Section 16720 :  HN1 [ ] "A trust is a combination of capital, skill or acts by two or more persons for any of the following  purposes: (a) To create or carry out restrictions in trade or commerce.  . . .  (e) To make or enter into or execute or carry out any

contracts, obligations or agreements of any kind or description, by which they do all or any combination of any of the following: . .  . (4) Agree to pool, combine or directly or indirectly unite any interests that they may have connected with the sale or  transportation of any . . . article or commodity, that its price might in any manner be affected." Section 16726 :  HN2 [ ] "Except as provided in this chapter, every trust is unlawful, against public policy and void."

Because the Cartwright Act is patterned after the federal Sherman Act and both have their roots in the common law, federal  cases interpreting the Sherman Act are applicable in construing the Cartwright Act. (  Chicago Title Ins. Co. v. Great Western  Financial Corp. (1968) 69 Cal.2d 305, 315 [70 Cal.Rptr. 849, 444 P.2d 481] .)

There is no contention that defendant engaged in the practice defined in the complaint as "bid shopping." Although also a form  of price competition, bid shopping is less desirable than bid peddling because only the general contractor, and not the awarding  authority or the public, benefits from this practice.  Post-award bid shopping is prohibited in California on public works  construction projects by  Government Code section 4104 , which requires general contractors, at the time they submit their prime  bids, to list the names of the subcontractors whose bids were accepted in the computation of their prime bids. Thus, general  contractors are not free to solicit lower subbids once they have been awarded the prime contract.  (See Comment (1970)  supra ,  18 U.C.L.A. L.Rev. 389, 396, 402-404 .) 

--- 頁碼 64 ---
In the system of bidding between general contractors and the awarding authority, the latter always has available the means by  which it can increase competition among general contractors and arrive at lower prime bids. If, fortuitously or by collusion, all of  the prime bids submitted on a particular project are too high, the awarding authority may simply reject all of them and reopen  bidding on the project.

Despite this unequivocal language, the circuit court, in affirming the district court's decision, sought to limit the holding: "It was  suggested that Rule V alone constituted a  per se  violation of Section 1; however, since the decision was based on the combined  effect of Rules V, III and VIII, and their implementation, we need not determine whether a  per se  violation occurred." ( 352 F.2d at  p. 819, fn. 5 .)

Referring to the rule requiring general contractors to accept the lowest bid submitted through the depository, the Court of  Appeal stated: "To require the general contractor to employ the lowest bid under 8B, at a time when he had seen no other  subbids, would be detrimental to the public, leading to collusion by the subcontractors and ruinous to the construction industry."  ( 233 Cal.App.2d at pp. 859-860 .)

Opinion Paragraph Eighth provides in relevant part: "The Bureau shall and it is hereby authorized to deduct, as compensation for its  services, fifteen (15%) per cent of all sums collected for the account of the Publisher. . . .  In the event any sums are paid directly  to the Publisher for any advertisements covered by this agreement, the Publisher shall render a true and correct account thereof  to the Bureau and shall pay to the Bureau within thirty days after receipt of said sums, a sum equal to fifteen (15%) per cent of  the amount paid to the Publisher." With reference to this paragraph of the contract, Telford Work, Secretary-Treasurer of the  Bureau, in his affidavit in support of the motion for summary judgment, states: "Advertisers are of course free to go directly to the  newspaper and place their legal advertising as many do, just as any other members of the general public also do, and there is  no prohibition of any kind against this.  However, the Bureau under its representation agreements would still be entitled to its  15% commission." 

--- 頁碼 78 ---
Paragraph Second provides in relevant part: "The Publisher hereby retains the services of the Bureau as representative of the  Publisher for soliciting and servicing of all legal advertising . . . provided, however, the Publisher reserves the right to withdraw,  at any time by notification in writing to the Bureau, from the terms of this agreement, the following classes of legal advertising:      [Par.] In the event the Publisher exercises the withdrawal privilege herein contained, Publisher agrees to and does hereby waive  during the period of such withdrawal the right to participate in the distributions and/or credits contemplated under paragraph  Ninth hereof." Paragraph Ninth provides for the annual pro-rata distributions of the Bureau's profits as discussed above. In its supplemental brief filed in this court, the Bureau, for the first time herein, contends that while the literal language of the  contract appears to dictate the total waiver of any right to profits as stated above, the actual practice has been to allow member  newspapers which have excluded certain classes of legal advertising from their contract to participate in the distribution of net  profits to the extent of the commissions they paid to the Bureau on nonexcluded classes.  Since no such facts appear in the  record, we cannot now consider this contention.  However, to the extent that such facts are relevant, they may be proved at trial.

The only member newspapers named as defendants in the complaint are those which publish in judicial districts in which every  newspaper qualified to carry legal advertisements is a member of the Bureau. Hereafter, unless otherwise indicated, all section references are to the Business and Professions Code. "We first consider  HN2 [ ] the affidavits of the moving party. They 'must contain facts sufficient to entitle . . . defendant to a  judgment in the action.  . . .' (  Code Civ. Proc., § 437c .) To prevail, therefore, such affidavits 'must state facts establishing every  element necessary to sustain a judgment in his favor.' [Citation.] Such facts 'shall be set forth with particularity' (  Code Civ. Proc.,  § 437c ) and shall be within the personal knowledge of the affiant, the affidavit to show that the affiant, if sworn as a witness, can  testify competently thereto.  As the court stated in  House  v.  Lala, supra , [180 Cal.App.2d 412 (4 Cal.Rptr. 366)] '[to]  HN3 [ ]  satisfy the statutory requirement of "particularity," the movant's affidavits must state all the requisite evidentiary facts and not  merely the ultimate facts.  [Citations.] Moreover, neither conclusions of law nor conclusions of fact are sufficient to satisfy the  statutory requirement.  [Citation.]'" (  Snider v. Snider (1962) 200 Cal.App.2d 741, 748-749 [19 Cal.Rptr. 709] .) HN4 [ ] "It is therefore well settled that summary judgment cannot be ordered for the moving party, even though the affidavits of  the opposing party be insufficient or absent, unless the moving part presents affidavits in support of his motion which comply  with the statute and show that he is entitled to judgment.  [Citations.] As is stated in  Southern Pacific Co.  v.  Fish, supra , [166  Cal.App.2d 353 (333 P.2d 133)] 'there first must be a  sufficiently supportive affidavit  before the defects of any counteraffidavit,  either of form or substance, need be examined; . . .'" (Original italics;  de Echeguren  v.  de  Echeguren (1962) 210 Cal.App.2d  141, 147 [26 Cal.Rptr. 562] .)

Section 16720  provides in relevant part:  HN8 [ ] "A trust is a combination of capital, skill or acts by two or more persons for  any of the following purposes: [Par.] (a) To create or carry out restrictions in trade or commerce. . . ."  Section 16726  provides:  "Except as provided in this chapter, every trust is unlawful, against public policy and void." Section 16727  provides in relevant part:  HN9 [ ] "It shall be unlawful for any person to . . . make a sale or contract for the sale  of goods, merchandise, machinery, supplies, commodities for use within the State, or to fix a price charged therefor, or discount  from, or rebate upon, such price, on the condition, agreement or understanding that the . . . purchaser thereof shall not use or  deal in the goods, merchandise, machinery, supplies, commodities, or services of a competitor . . . where the effect of such . . .  sale, or contract for sale or such condition, agreement or understanding may be to substantially lessen competition or tend to  create a monopoly in any line of trade or commerce in any section of the State."

Defendants contend that Statewide has no standing to raise these claims because it does not compete with the Bureau and  has therefore suffered no injury as a result of whatever restrictions in trade the agreements may generate.  While it is true that  Statewide does not offer to represent newspapers in the same manner as the Bureau, our summation of the facts demonstrates  that in the area of publication of notices of trustee's sales; Statewide and the Bureau offer nearly identical services.  Since they  compete in the latter area, Statewide has standing to sue. The Bureau also claims that Statewide has suffered no injury because its members were never under any obligation to pay  commissions to Statewide. Statewide replies that the newspapers have a customary and quasicontractual duty to pay such  commissions.  These opposing arguments cannot be resolved on the basis of the declarations on file. A facsimile of the agreement has been attached as an exhibit to, and made a part of, the Bureau's declaration in support of its  motion as well as Statewide's declaration in opposition to the motion.  Thus, the terms of this document are undisputed. 

--- 頁碼 82 ---
The Bureau also contends that any restrictive effect arising from its agreements is caused by the legally sanctioned monopoly  held by newspapers qualified to publish legal advertisements. As we have seen, however, the restrictive effect flows from the  terms of the agreements themselves, and not from the statutes governing "newspapers of general circulation" within the  meaning of the Government Code.  (  Gov. Code, §§ 6000- 6078 .) The further argument that the contract provisions are justified because they allow the Bureau to act as a clearing house for legal  notices in the County of Los Angeles again presents a question of fact which should be determined at trial. Since we find that there are triable issues of fact as to whether the representation agreements are tying arrangements violative  of  sections 16720  and  16726 , we need not determine whether the agreements also independently violate  section 16727 . 

--- 頁碼 83 ---
However, we deem it unnecessary to determine whether this tying effect is sufficient to bring the agreement within the per se  rule established by the United States Supreme Court cases cited above.  Most cases involving tying arrangements have dealt  with situations where the seller absolutely refused to sell one product separately from another.  Here, there is no such refusal,  but a higher price is exacted for the tying product if the tied product is not also purchased.  Such an arrangement appears to  present many of the same evils inherent in a classic tying arrangement within the prohibition of  section 16726 .  (  Federal Trade  Com'n v. Paramount Famous-Lasky Corp. (2d Cir. 1932) 67 F.2d 152, 155 ;  Washington Gas Light Co. v. Virginia Electric &  Power Co. (E.D.Va. 1970) 309 F.Supp. 1119, 1125 ; Turner,  The Validity of Tying Arrangements Under the Antitrust Laws  (1958)  72 Harv.L.Rev. 50, 65-73.) 

--- 頁碼 84 ---
We also note that it will be necessary for the trial court to determine the dollar-volume of business foreclosed by any tying  arrangement which it may find inherent in paragraph Second.  (See  Fortner Enterprises v. U.S. Steel, supra, 394 U.S. 495, 501  [22 L.Ed.2d 495, 503] .) The declarations filed in this case are of no assistance on this vital issue.

Opinion The board points out Marin County sellers may list their properties with other services, but these are regional services not likely  to have a substantial impact on the sale of property in Marin County. Since a salesman must be employed by a broker in order to sell real estate (  Bus. & Prof. Code, § 10132 ;  Grand v. Griesinger  (1958) 160 Cal.App.2d 397 [325 P.2d 475] ), denial of membership and employment substantially hinders a salesman from  pursuing a career in the real estate field.

Other state cases cited by CAR are similarly inapposite.  They are based on statutes that are materially different from the  Cartwright Act and, in most cases, are narrower than the California statute.

This appears to be the case, as the following portion of the record demonstrates: "The Court: . . . So, the question in this case  is whether the action of the board was proper.  There is no question that the action of the board imposed a disadvantage upon  Mr. Palsson, and you are entitled -- you really don't have to show that.  You are entitled to show the monetary extent of that  disadvantage, if you can, and then the next question is whether that disadvantage is a result of proper or improper action on the  part of the board." In  Jones v. San Bernardino Real Estate Board (1959) 168 Cal.App.2d 661 [336 P.2d 606] , the Court of Appeal upheld a real  estate association's membership restriction similar to that in the case at bar.  However, the court did not discuss either  antitrust  law  or the possible relationship between membership in a real estate association and access to a multiple listing service.  The  decision, thus, is of little help to us. See  Barrows  v.  Grand Rapids Real Estate Board  (1974)  supra ,  214 N.W.2d 532  (exclusion of nonmembers of real estate board  from multiple listing service upheld under common law and state  antitrust law , where nonmembers were substantially able to  compete and majority of sales in the area were not made through the service);  Collins v.

The rule of reason has also been used to evaluate alleged group boycotts outside of the voluntary association context.  (See,  e.g.,  Dalmo Sales Co. v. Tysons Corner Regional Shopping Center (D.D.C. 1970) 308 F.Supp. 988  (action by department stores  excluding plaintiff appliance dealer from shopping center);  Savon Gas Stations Number Six, Inc. v. Shell Oil Company (4th Cir.  1962) 309 F.2d 306  (restrictive covenant in lease agreement between shopping center and oil company providing that center  would not lease to competitor of oil company).) Decisions applying the per se rule to associational noncoercive practices include the above-cited  Collins  v.  Main Line Board of  Realtors  (1973)  supra ,  304 A.2d 493 , and  Oates  v.  Eastern Bergen County Multiple List. Serv. Inc . (1971)  supra ,  273 A.2d 795 .  In  People v. Santa Clara Valley Bowling etc. Assn. (1965) 238 Cal.App.2d 225 [47 Cal.Rptr. 570] , the Court of Appeal labeled as  a per se violation a bowling proprietors' association rule providing that bowlers could compete in association tournaments only if  they bowled a certain number of league games in member houses.  The court found that such a rule was intended to coerce  bowlers into abandoning nonmember establishments and frequent those owned by members.   Silver v. New York Stock Exchange (1963) 373 U.S. 341 [10 L.Ed.2d 389, 83 S.Ct. 1246] , is also sometimes cited to show the  general applicability of the per se rule. In that case, two Texas over-the -counter brokers and dealers in securities arranged with  members of the New York Stock Exchange for direct telephone connections with a number of firms.  The exchange told the firms  to disconnect the telephones, substantially damaging the business of the Texans.  The court found that the Sherman Act was  violated, although its rationale is not entirely clear.  While the opinion begins with language indicating the finding of a per se  violation, the court then proceeds to examine and reject various justifications for the exchange's practice and also attacks the  lack of procedural due process granted the plaintiffs.  The latter part of the decision has led at least two commentators to  conclude that  Silver  applied the rule of reason. (Note,  Trade Association Exclusionary Practices: An Affirmative Role for the Rule  of Reason  (1966) 66 Colum.L.Rev. 1486, 1487-1488;  The Supreme Court, 1962 Term  (1963) 77 Harv.L.Rev. 62, 156.) Others  

--- 頁碼 96 ---
have interpreted  Silver  as a per se case, a circumstance which justifies the criticism of one writer that "The judgment of history  must surely be that the courts and the legal profession have been far more successful in the results achieved in antitrust cases  than in their efforts to articulate the ideas involved." (Rahl,  Per Se Rules and Boycotts Under the Sherman Act: Some  Reflections on the Klor's Case  (1959)  supra , 45 Va.L.Rev. 1165, 1168.) We recognize that in rejecting a per se rule in this case we are sacrificing some advantages, i.e., the facilitation of judicial  certainty and the saving of litigation costs.  (  Northern Pac. R. Co.  v.  United States  (1958)  supra ,  356 U.S. 1, 5 .) But the cost  need not be significant.  If a particular regulation is declared invalid under the rule of reason, both the courts and parties in a  future case may contemplate that a similar rule in a comparable industry having like economic effects will also be held invalid.   Adoption of the rule of reason does not preclude application of the doctrine of stare decisis. 

--- 頁碼 97 ---
Although this case deals primarily with a salesman, we see no reason to distinguish between a salesman and a broker with  respect to the access rule.  Nonmember brokers, like nonmember salesmen, are of course denied access to the multiple listing  service and are thus injured by the rule to the same extent as salesmen. Moreover, the possible justifications for both rules --  insuring professional and ethical competence and preserving autonomy over provision of benefits and membership selection --  apply equally to both groups.  The only difference between the two groups is in the injury caused by the "primarily engaged" rule.   While part-time brokers are excluded from membership by a separate "primarily engaged" bylaw, such exclusion does not  prevent them from earning a living to the same extent that it reacts upon salesmen, who may not sell real estate unless  employed by a broker. It is not necessary for Palsson to prove that many brokers and salesmen have actually left the real estate field or declined to  enter because of failure to obtain membership. When, as in the present case, a practice has a tendency to restrain trade, it may  violate  antitrust law , "whether it be 'wholly nascent or abortive on the one hand, or successful on the other.'" (  Id., at p. 12 [89  L.Ed. at p. 2026 ].) 

--- 頁碼 98 ---
We emphasize that the question before us concerns the validity of the "primarily engaged" rule in conjunction with other board  bylaws effectively denying employment to nonmember salesmen. The question of availability of judicial review for an exclusion  from membership, absent the access rule and the employment rules, is not before us.

Public notice advertising includes advertising of such items as notices of trustee sales, certificates of fictitious names, probate  notices, tax sale lists, solicitations for bids for government contracts and other notices required by law.

The representation agreement has been modified over the years several times.  With one exception (see  infra , fn. 4), these  modifications are not here relevant. Paragraph Eighth provides in relevant part: "The BUREAU shall and it is hereby authorized to deduct, as compensation for its  services, fifteen (15%) per cent of all sums collected for the account of the PUBLISHER . . . .  In the event any sums are paid  directly to the PUBLISHER for any advertisements covered by this agreement, the PUBLISHER shall render a true and correct  account thereof to the BUREAU and shall pay to the BUREAU within thirty days after receipt of said sums, a sum equal to fifteen  (15%) per cent of the amount paid to the PUBLISHER." Paragraph Second provides in relevant part: "The PUBLISHER hereby retains the services of the BUREAU as representative  of the PUBLISHER for soliciting and servicing of all legal advertising . . .; provided, however, the PUBLISHER reserves the right  to withdraw, at any time by notification in writing to the BUREAU, from the terms of this agreement, the following classes of legal  advertising: ?    [para. ] In the event the PUBLISHER exercises the withdrawal privilege herein contained, PUBLISHER agrees to  and does hereby waive during the period of such withdrawal the right to participate in the distributions and/or credits  contemplated under paragraph Ninth hereof." Paragraph Ninth provides for the annual pro rata distributions of the Bureau's  profits as discussed above. Following  Corwin I , the Bureau amended paragraph Second to state that if the member exercised its withdrawal right it waived  only that portion of the annual participation credit referable to the advertising withdrawn. Section 16720  provides in relevant part: "A trust is a combination of capital, skill or acts by two or more persons for any of the  following purposes: [para. ] (a) To create or carry out restrictions in trade or commerce."  Section 16726  provides: "Except as  provided in this chapter, every trust is unlawful, against public policy and void." Statewide also argued at trial that paragraph Second itself was a tying arrangement constituting a per se violation of  sections  16720  and  16726 .  The trial judge found, however, that no tying arrangement existed.  Statewide does not challenge this finding  on appeal. 

--- 頁碼 106 ---
We also determined that Statewide had presented a triable issue of fact as to whether paragraph Second constituted an illegal  tying arrangement ( 4 Cal.3d at pp. 856-857 ). Statewide, however, does not challenge the trial judge's determination that no tying  arrangement existed. 

--- 頁碼 107 ---
In 1972 this provision was eliminated from the representation agreement.  (See fn. 4,  ante .) The trial court found that "[throughout] the long history of the Bureau many members have excluded various kinds and classes  of advertising from the agreement.  The means of exclusion have varied -- some formal, others informal.  The evidence is clear  and convincing that no penalty of any kind whatsoever has been assessed by the Bureau or any of its members to any member  for excluding any class or classes of advertising from the agreement and that the annual participation credit has been paid to  each and every member of the Bureau regardless of whether that member had withdrawn or excluded any class or classes of  advertising from the agreement." Moreover, as the trial court found, "STATEWIDE never made any effort to represent any newspaper published by the  defendants in this case from 1966 to the present in the business of soliciting and servicing public notice advertising.  STATEWIDE was not forced to offer representation for all public notice advertising. The withdrawal clause in the Representation  Agreement permitted STATEWIDE to offer representation with regard to individual classes of such advertising." Statewide also challenges the trial court's finding that the "[relevant] geographic market is limited to the State of California" and  that the "relevant product is the services of a newspaper representative in the field of public notice advertising." Statewide  argues that the relevant geographic market must be limited to the County of Los Angeles and that the relevant line of commerce  must be limited to notices of trustee's sales.  In  Corwin I  we explained that the definition of the relevant market or line of  commerce presents a question of law and fact.  ( 4 Cal.3d at p. 855 .) Statewide does not explain how the trial court's definition  fails as a matter of law.  Moreover, the trial court's finding is supported by substantial evidence on the record.  Although the  Bureau's membership is limited to the County of Los Angeles, over 40 percent of Statewide's files involved property located  outside Los Angeles.  As to "relevant product," the evidence shows that Statewide neither attempted to represent newspapers  for trustee sale notices or public notice advertising generally nor performed any substantial services for the newspapers. 

--- 頁碼 108 ---
Statewide relies in particular on our footnote 3, which states, "In its supplemental brief filed in this court, the Bureau, for the  first time herein, contends that while the literal language of the contract appears to dictate the total waiver of any right to profits  as stated above, the actual practice has been to allow member newspapers which have excluded certain classes of legal  advertising from their contract to participate in the distribution of net profits to the extent of the commissions they paid to the  Bureau on nonexcluded classes.  Since no such facts appear in the record,  we cannot now consider this contention.  However,  to the extent that such facts are relevant, they may be proved at trial ." (Italics added.) ( 4 Cal.3d at p. 849, fn. 3 .) The evidence presented at trial demonstrated that members could exclude classes of advertising from the agreement at any  time by letter or telephone call or even by a refusal to pay for a class of advertising. The 14 member-newspaper representatives  who testified at the trial stated that they knew about the withdrawal privilege.  Their testimony indicated that nearly all member  newspapers excluded at least one class of advertising from the agreement. 

--- 頁碼 109 ---
Since  sections 16720  and  16726  of the Cartwright Act were patterned after the Sherman Act ( 15 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. ), decisions  under the latter act apply to the former.  (  Corwin I, 4 Cal.3d at p. 852 .) Examples of per se violations include price fixing agreements (  U. S. v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co. (1940) 310 U.S. 150 [84 L.Ed.  1129, 60 S.Ct. 811] ) and tying arrangements (  Northern Pac. R. Co. v. United States (1958) 356 U.S. 1 [2 L.Ed.2d 545, 78 S.Ct.  514] ). Statewide makes no claim of a per se violation in this appeal. In sum, the trial court found that the Bureau was originally organized in response to the monopolization of the public notice  advertising business by a corporation which excluded community newspapers from the advertising. The underlying principle of  the Bureau since its creation, the trial court found, has been to help community newspapers compete for public notice  advertising. This policy, the trial court found, results in the publication of notices in the newspaper most likely to be effective.   The trial court concluded that the Bureau substantially benefits both the public and the newspaper industry. Moreover, the trial court found no evidence of any artificial barrier or restraint to competition.  Representatives of member  newspapers who testified at the trial stated that their agreement with the Bureau did not restrain them from dealing with  Statewide or any other independent organization.  Representatives of newspapers who did not pay Statewide a commission  testified without exception that they paid no commission because Statewide did not provide them with any valuable services, and  not because of any arrangement with the Bureau.

Indeed testimony at trial suggested that a newspaper could withdraw "all advertising placed by Statewide" from the  representation agreement. Particularly damaging to Statewide's case are the undisputed findings that, although Statewide knew of the withdrawal  provision of the representation agreement, it never proposed to any Bureau newspaper to serve as the newspaper's  representative for servicing trustee notices, and that Statewide did not perform any services for the newspapers. Because we affirm the judgment for defendants, it is unnecessary to consider the claim of defendant Copley Press, Inc., that it  was entitled to a dismissal because of plaintiffs' failure to serve notice to them within three years after the commencement of this  action.

All section references are to the Government Code unless otherwise indicated.   Section 11180  provides:  HN2 [ ] "The head of  each department may make investigations and prosecute actions concerning: "(a) All matters relating to the business activities and subjects under the jurisdiction of the department. "(b) Violations of any law or rule or order of the department. "(c) Such other matters as may be provided by law." The Attorney General is head of the Department of Justice (§ 12510; cf. § 15000), which includes the Office of the Attorney  General (§ 15001). As of October 1, 1977, all functions of the FPC were transferred to the Secretary of Energy and the Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission.  ( 42 U.S.C. §§ 7151 ,  7172 ,  7341 ; Exec. Order No. 12009,  42 Fed. Reg. 46267  (Sept. 13, 1977),  42 U.S.C.A. §  7341 , note.) For convenience here we use "FPC" to refer to the entity exercising those functions after as well as before the  transfer.

A proceeding against PG&E culminated in an order of the San Francisco Superior Court filed November 22, 1976, which  enforced most of the terms of the subpena and is now final.  ARCO did not respond to its subpena. Instead it obtained from the  United States District Court, Central District of California, an injunction against enforcement that is still on appeal.  See  post ,  footnote 8.  The ARCO proceeding is discussed below in connection with defendants' contention that the present proceedings  are barred by collateral estoppel. Federal cases interpreting the Sherman Act generally apply to construction of the Cartwright Act.  (  Mailand v. Burckle (1978)  20 Cal.3d 367, 376 [143 Cal. Rptr. 1, 572 P.2d 1142] ;  Marin County Bd. of Realtors, Inc. v. Palsson (1976) 16 Cal.3d 920, 925  [130 Cal. Rptr. 1, 549 P.2d 833] ;  Corwin v. Los Angeles Newspaper Service Bureau, Inc. (1971) 4 Cal.3d 842, 852-853 [94 Cal.  Rptr. 785, 484 P.2d 953] .)

Cases cited as examples of conflict between state and federal antitrust laws involve statutory differences not present here:  Connell Co. v. Plumbers & Steamfitters (1975) 421 U.S. 616 [44 L. Ed. 2d 418, 95 S. Ct. 1830]  (though federal  antitrust law   applies to contractor's collective bargaining agreement to subcontract only with firms recognizing union, Texas law does not  apply because, unlike federal law, it conflicts with federal policies favoring employee organization); cf.   Shell Oil Co. v. Younger  (9th Cir. 1978) 587 F.2d 34  (  Bus. & Prof. Code, § 21200 , prohibiting motor-fuel price discrimination, not preempted by Sherman  or Robinson-Patman acts even though it provides a "meeting competition" defense that is narrower than  15 U.S.C. § 13(b)   (Robinson-Patman)). In questioning the relevance of those concerns to an investigation designed to uncover violations of state  antitrust law , the  dissenting opinion ( post , at p. 419) appears to lose sight of (1) the overlap and consequent necessity for coordination of state  and federal antitrust enforcement, and (2) the Attorney General's right, on discovering possible violations, not only to invoke  existing remedies but also to recommend to legislators and administrators improvement of those remedies or creation of  alternate remedies.

Defendants rely on  Standard Radio & Television Co. v. Chronicle Pub. Co. (1960) 182 Cal. App. 2d 293 [6 Cal. Rptr. 246] ,  which barred a Cartwright Act suit that attacked "exclusivity" clauses through which contracts for film distribution to defendant  television stations forbade marketing of the same films to other stations, including plaintiff's, within a 60-mile radius.  The Court  of Appeal concluded that the suit was foreclosed by the FCC's power over such arrangements in connection with its aims to  optimize use of broadcast channels ( 182 Cal. App. 2d at pp. 298-300 ; see  Nat. Broadcasting Co. v. U.S. (1943) 319 U.S. 190,  200-201, 214-220, 222-224 [87 L. Ed. 1344, 1354-1355, 1361-1367, 63 S. Ct. 997] ), even though such power would not  foreclose a suit to enforce federal antitrust laws ( 182 Cal. App. 2d at pp. 300-301 ). That case preceded decisions that limited the preemptive effect of the Federal Communications Act (  Head v. New Mexico  Board of Examiners in Optometry (1963) 374 U.S. 424 [10 L. Ed. 2d 983, 83 S. Ct. 1759] ; see O'Neil,  Television, Tort Law, and  Federalism  (1965) 53 Cal. L. Rev. 421, 456-460) and that curtailed federal statutes' preemptive effect on state proceedings  peripheral to these statutes' central concerns (  De Canas v. Bica, supra, 424 U.S. 351 ;  Farmer v. United Brotherhood of  Carpenters, supra, 430 U.S. 290 ). (See too Note,  Federal Preemption in Television Antitrust  (1961) 13 Stan.L. Rev. 629)  (criticizing  Standard Radio  even under precedents then available.)  Standard Radio  is disapproved insofar as it holds that a  federal regulatory scheme which does not expressly restrict the states and allows enforcement of federal antitrust laws  nonetheless may preclude state antitrust enforcement consistent with those laws.

See footnote 3,  ante .  ARCO was granted a temporary restraining order on June 14, 1976, a preliminary injunction on  September 29, 1977, and a summary judgment incorporating a permanent injunction on June 26, 1978.  ( Lewis and Atlantic  Richfield Co.  v.  Younger et al ., (C.D. Cal.) Dock. No. CV 76-1890-FW.) Appeal is pending in the Ninth Circuit. The factual distinction discussed in the dissenting opinion ( post , at pp. 419-420) does not undercut the applicability here of the  quoted words.  Though asserted by the FPC the distinction was rejected by the court of appeals, which said: "In our former  opinion we fully adjudicated and decided the same issue recurring now under equivalent circumstances that the Commission  lacks jurisdiction to regulate gas produced, sold, and consumed intrastate, which is transported in a pipeline commingled with  interstate gas and that decision as between these parties bars resurrection of the issue again." ( 334 F.2d at p. 412 .) When reversing, the Supreme Court majority gave no weight to the asserted distinction and indicated no disagreement with the  court of appeals' conclusion that its former opinion "decided the same issue recurring now under equivalent circumstances." The  concurring opinion footnote ( 379 U.S. at p. 691 [13 L. Ed. 2d at p. 608 ]), quoted in the dissent here ( post ., p. 420, fn. 8), declared  that the factual changes " standing alone , makes inapplicable any doctrine of collateral estoppel" (italics added) but did not  disagree with the majority's broader statement, quoted in our text above, that the doctrine "has no place here" ( 379 U.S. at p.  690 ).

The operative provisions of the federal judgment, of which we may take judicial notice (  Evid. Code, §§ 452, subd. (d) ;  459 ), are  as follows: "It Is Ordered, Adjudged and Decreed that Defendants' Investigation of Ownership, Production, Sale and Distribution  of Prudhoe Bay, Alaska Natural Gas and Defendants' Subpoena directed to Plaintiffs to Attend, Testify and to Produce Books,  Records, Papers and Documents are unconstitutional.  [para. ] It Is Further Ordered, Adjudged and Decreed that Defendants,  and each of them, and all persons acting under them or in concert with them, be, and hereby are,  permanently enjoined and  restrained  from conducting an Investigation of Plaintiff Company's Ownership, Production, Sale and Distribution of Prudhoe Bay,  Alaska Natural Gas and enforcing the Subpoena to Attend, Testify and to Produce Books, Records, Papers and Documents  directed to Plaintiffs Howard H. Lewis and Atlantic Richfield Company." (Italics added.) In its memorandum of decision, filed concurrently with the judgment, the court indicated that its injunction was to be made  permanent "[because] of the potential for serious harm such an investigation would have on the federal regulatory scheme." It  also stated: "Generally [federal] courts will not enjoin the enforcement of state criminal statutes.  'But this is not an absolute  policy and in some circumstances injunctive relief may be appropriate.'  Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U.S. 705, 712 (1977) . Such a  situation exists in this case; the rule applies to civil cases." In the words of an influential commentary on the subject, "[collateral] estoppel is that aspect of res judicata concerned with the  effect of a final judgment on subsequent litigation of a different cause of action involving some of the same issues determined in  the initial action." (Note,  Developments in the Law: Res Judicata  (1952) 65 Harv. L. Rev.  818, 840, fn. omitted.)

"A federal court judgment has the same effect in the courts of this state as it would in a federal court.  [Citations.] The federal  rule is that a judgment or order, once rendered, is final for purposes of res judicata until reversed on appeal or modified or set  aside in the court of rendition.  (  Stoll  v.  Gottlieb, supra , 305 U.S. 165, 170 . . . .)" (  Martin v. Martin, supra, 2 Cal.3d 752, 761- 762 , fn.  omitted.)

The reply brief urges in addition that the Alaska Natural Gas Transportation Act does not preempt the subject investigation and  that the investigation involves no violation of the commerce clause, the due process clause, or Fourth Amendment search and  seizure protections. As indicated above, the Attorney General's delegation of authority to investigate pursuant to  Government Code section 11182   authorizes the delegates "to conduct an investigation into the ownership, production, sale and distribution of Prudhoe Bay,  Alaska, natural gas insofar as it affects the state of California, to determine the existence, nature, and scope of violations of the  federal and state  antitrust laws pertaining to price fixing, monopolization, division of markets, and restraint of trade, and to hold  hearings, issue subpoenas inspect books and records, take testimony, hear complaints, and administer oaths in connection  therewith, as [the delegates] deem necessary." The Attorney General has at no time suggested that the instant investigation is  directed toward the development of an informational basis for possible future action by him under the  federal  antitrust laws. (See  generally,  Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co. (1972) 405 U.S. 251, 257-260 [31 L. Ed. 2d 184, 189-191, 92 S. Ct. 885] ;  In re Multidistrict  Vehicle Air Pollution M.D.L. No. 31 (9th Cir. 1973) 481 F.2d 122, 131 .) Nor has he suggested, aside from a passing reference in  his opening brief, that other less specific purposes, such as making a report to some appropriate legislative body, such as the  United States Congress, was contemplated.  As I indicate in more detail below, an investigation having such broad purposes as  these would raise questions which, in light of the Attorney General's posture in these proceedings, are not now before us.

The controlling effect of the clear factual differences between the two sets of contracts was made even clearer in a concurring  opinion representing the views of three justices.  It was there stated: "Some years prior to this action Amerada-Signal claimed no  more than its proportionate share, and under those circumstances the FPC disclaimed jurisdiction.  See  North Dakota v. FPC,  247 F.2d 173 (C.A. 8th Cir.  1957) . The fact that the amount claimed by respondents at the time of this action exceeds Amerada- Signal's proportionate share is due to  the addition of new sources of supply to the commingled stream .  This change, standing  alone, makes inapplicable any doctrine of collateral estoppel based on the FPC's disclaimer or the Court of Appeals' affirmance  in  North Dakota v. FPC, supra. " ( 379 U.S. at p. 691 , fn. * [ 13 L. Ed. 2d at p. 608, fn. 1 ]; italics added.)

The draft is a selection system whereby the respective NFL teams are awarded the initial rights to negotiate exclusively with  football players graduating from college. The option clause is a provision of the NFL Standard Player Contract which grants the team the right to renew a player's contract  for one additional year if the team and player cannot agree to a new contract.  After the option year expires, the player becomes  a "free agent" and may negotiate and contract with teams of another league or with other NFL teams subject to the Rozelle rule. The Rozelle rule is named after the NFL commissioner, Pete Rozelle.  This rule provides if a free agent contracts with another  NFL team, the new team must compensate the player's former team with draft choice(s) or other player contracts.  If the new  and former teams cannot agree as to the compensation, the commissioner arbitrates the matter and determines the  compensation. The tampering rule prohibits an NFL team from negotiating with a player currently under contract with another NFL team. Also, if  one team has the exclusive right to negotiate with a player, no other team may tamper with that player. The one-man rule refers to the commissioner's authority to compel a player to adhere to terms of an operative collective  bargaining agreement between the players and the NFL teams. This second collective bargaining agreement was negotiated during the pendency of antitrust suits brought by players against  the NFL.  The most significant case,  Alexander  v.  National Football League  (D.Minn. 1977) 1977-2 Trade Cases (CCH) para.  61,730, was a class action.  The agreement and  Alexander  incorporate a settlement which includes the practices and rules  Partee challenges.  The settlement also contains a covenant not to sue (in antitrust) by the class members.  However, Partee,  who filed this suit before the specified cutoff date, chose not to be a class member.  This agreement terminated in mid-1982.

As considered by the trial court in  Flood  v.  Kuhn , baseball's reserve system had many of the attributes of the NFL rules and  practices of which Partee complains.  Baseball's reserve system involved an agreement by all of the teams to be involved in a  draft creating exclusive bargaining rights in the club as to the draftee; a uniform player's contract empowering the signing club  unilaterally to renew a player's contract from year to year; denial of any right in a player, once signed, to negotiate with any other  team; a prescribed number of players per team; and the unilateral right of a team to assign the contract to another team. (See  Flood v. Kuhn, supra, 316 F.Supp. 271, 273-275 .)

The dissent asserts that today's holding strikes a significant blow to the vitality of the Cartwright Act and that by this opinion "we  would necessarily have to exempt all businesses engaged in multistate activities." (Dis. opn. at pp. 389, 408.) This opinion has a  limited scope.  The Cartwright Act remains vital.  We do not mean to suggest that multistate activities of other businesses may  not be subject to state regulation upon due consideration of the commerce clause. Our holding is limited to the issue directly  before us, the inapplicability of the Cartwright Act to professional football.

Concur Dissent (U.S. Const., art. VI,  cl. 2 .) "The Congress shall have Power . . . To regulate Commerce . . . among the several States . . . ." (U.S.  Const., art. I, § 8 ,  cl. 3 .)  The Supreme Court has explained: "The Commerce Clause reaches, in the main, three categories of problems.  First, the use of  channels of interstate or foreign commerce which Congress deems are being misused, as, for example, the shipment of stolen  goods . . . or of persons who have been kidnapped . . . .  Second, protection of the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, as,  for example, the destruction of an aircraft . . . or persons or things in commerce, as, for example, thefts from interstate shipments  . . . .  Third, those activities affecting commerce." (  Perez v. United States (1971) 402 U.S. 146, 150 [28 L.Ed.2d 686, 690, 91  S.Ct. 1357] .) We are here concerned with the third element of interstate commerce jurisdiction.
