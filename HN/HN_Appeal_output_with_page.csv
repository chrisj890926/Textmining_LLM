Only a portion of the employed members in San Francisco of Building Service Employees Union, Local 87, work for 
Building Maintenance Contractors (725 to 794) as compared with the total [*8]  number of employed members 
(2085-3534). Of a total of 190 office buildings in San Francisco, 22 are serviced by building maintenance 
contractors (including defendants and others) and 168 directly by owners or operators who employ members of 
Local 87. Of other types of buildings, the same figures in the same order are: 50 department and furniture stores, 
14 and 36; 17 laundries and breweries, 3 and 14; 55 banks, 30 and 25; 4 newspapers, 1 and 3. Of buildings 
serviced by contractors or by owners or operators, employing members of Local 87, 24% are serviced by 
contractors; 76% independently of contractors. In addition, there are thousands of San Francisco buildings 
(exclusive of private homes, flats and the like) that are serviced neither by owners or operators who employ 
members of Local 87, nor by any maintenance contractor.
Building Maintenance Contractors employ but 121 of 404 members of Local 44, 165 of 965 members of Local 117, 
and 5 of 225 members of Local 39. Of buildings serviced by contractors or by members of these Locals 
* Except that the buildings of the Pacific Gas & Electric Company and of the Pacific Telephone and Telegraph Company are 
serviced by those companies, respectively, employing members of [O> the <O] unions of the Congress of Industrial 
Organizations.
