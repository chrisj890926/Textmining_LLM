941,Counsel,"Counsel: Marshall C. Berger, Ira M. Millstein and Irving Scher for appellant.  I. The effect of the decisions below is 
to abdicate court control over State statutory public policy.  (Matter of Colletti [Mesh], 23 A D 2d 245, 17 N Y 2d 
460; Matter of Bay Iron Works [Eisenstein], 17 A D 2d 804; Durst v. Abrash, 22 A D 2d 39, 17 N Y 2d 445; Wilko v.

Assn. [Yonkers Raceway], 31 Misc 2d 474.) II. The lower courts' decisions conflict with the purposes and 
enforcement policy of the Donnelly Act.  ( Manhattan Stor. & Warehouse Co. v. Movers & Warehousemen's Assn. 
of Greater N. Y., 289 N. Y. 82; Kalmanash v. Smith, 291 N.  Y. 142; Consumer-Farmer Milk Coop. v. Milk Drivers & 
Dairy Employees Local No. 584, 13 Misc 2d 590.) III. Antitrust affirmative defenses and counterclaims in contract 
actions have traditionally been looked upon with disfavor by the courts and are contrary to the principal purpose for 
arbitration.  ( Kelly v. Kosuga, 358 U.S. 516; Loew's Inc. v. Radio Hawaii, 20 Misc 2d 587; Fleischmann Distilling 
Corp. v. Frontier Liq. Corp., 18 Misc 2d 903; Matter of Mole [Queen Ins.  Co. of America], 14 A D 2d 1; Sporn v. 
Hudson Tr. Lines, 265 App. Div. 360.) IV. Tomar's Donnelly Act claim, in effect, is an assertion that the entire 
agreement between the parties is void.  (Automatic Canteen Co.  [****4]   of America v. Federal Trade Comm., 346 
U.S. 61; Matter of Kramer & Uchitelle [Eddington Fabrics Corp.], 288 N. Y. 467.)
Daniel F. Fitzgerald, Jr., for respondent.  I. Having affirmed the arbitration agreement by initiating arbitration 
proceedings, petitioner-appellant may not now raise issues of illegality.  (Matter of Exercycle Corp. [Maratta], 9 N Y 
2d 329; Cole v. Mostel, 27 A D 2d 721; Matter of Wrap-Vertiser Corp. [Plotnick], 3 N Y 2d 17; Matter of National

Matter of Staklinski [Pyramid Elec. Co.], 6 A D 2d 565, 6 N Y 2d 159.) II. Arbitration of a Donnelly Act claim offends 
no announced public policy of this State.  (Matter of Standardbred Owners Assn. [Yonkers Raceway], 31 Misc 2d 
474; Brooklyn Distilling Co. v. Standard Distilling & Distr. Co., 120 App. Div. 237, 193 N. Y. 551; Cummings v. Union 
Blue Stone Co., 164 N. Y. 401;  [****5]  Matter of Exercycle Corp. [Maratta], 9 N Y 2d 329; Manhattan Stor. & 
Warehouse Co.  v. Movers & Warehousemen's Assn. of Greater N. Y., 289 N. Y. 82; Saucy Susan Prods. v. Allied

Misc. 849; Matter of Grayson-Robinson Stores [Iris Constr. Corp.], 8 N Y 2d 133; Alexander's Dept. Stores v. 
Orbach's, 266 App. Div. 535.) III. The Donnelly Act claim is not asserted as a defense to, or avoidance of, 
contractual liability, but as a proper and related affirmative claim.  ( Kelly v. Kosuga, 358 U.S. 516; Refrigeration 
Sales Co. v. York Corp., 32 Misc 2d 231, 18 A D 2d 1140; Sporn v. Hudson Tr. Lines, 265 App. Div. 360; Renault,
