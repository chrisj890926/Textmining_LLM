G.  The Defense of In Pari Delicto, Assumption of Risk of the Conspiracy, Waiver of Rights Arising from the 
Conspiracy and Estoppel 
Appellant Consolidation Coal claims error in the District Court's instruction on its various defenses.  Particular 
emphasis is assigned to the alleged error in the District Court's instruction on the defense of in pari delicto.  With 
reference to this defense, the District Court charged the jury that: 
""Now, the defendants here say that, admitting all of these things for the sake of argument, as we put it, 
whatever damage came to the plaintiff, that he was a part of it. 
""He can't claim anything against the coal operators because this arrangement which they had with the UMW 
had his approval and endorsement, that he was a member of the BCOA -- Bituminous [**42]  Coal Operators 
Association -- that drew up the contract, and that he was a sponsor of it and, therefore, if he got hurt by it, if it 
was wrong, he was helping in a wrong, 'impari delicto' [sic] they call it.  That is equal guilt. 
 [*784]  ""A person who is of equal guilt cannot claim that he has been wronged by other people who assisted or 
collaborated with him on the same project. 
""The defendants have entered the defense of 'in pari delicto' -- this means that the defendants say that if an 
unlawful conspiracy existed, plaintiff was equally responsible with defendants in the formation of said 
conspiracy. 
""Under this defense, the Court charges you that if the plaintiff was a co-initiator of the conspiracy and equally 
responsible therefor, plaintiff is not entitled to recover damages for that period of time that the plaintiff remained 
a party to the conspiracy. 
""Now, a person may be a party to such an arrangement, be 'in pari delicto,' but he can withdraw from that.  You 
are not once brushed with tar that you can't get rid of. 
""So, even though you may believe that he did do this, that he was in this arrangement, entered into this 
contract for the purpose of putting other [**43]  operators out of business, yet, if you believe that he withdrew 
from and he got out of it and if you find that the defendants were more responsible than the plaintiff for the 
formation of the conspiracy, plaintiff may recover, even though it was a party to the conspiracy, even though 
South-East Coal Company was a party to the conspiracy. 
""Even though you may find that plaintiff was a party to the conspiracy and if you find that plaintiff withdrew from 
the conspiracy and sought to avoid the effects of the conspiracy, it may recover damages arising in the period 
of the case subsequent to such withdrawal.""
This charge more than adequately instructed the jury with respect to the defense of in pari delicto, and the effect 
South-East's participation in the conspiracy would have on the amount of damages recoverable if termination of its 
part in the conspiracy did not occur.  The only difficulty with the instruction is that perhaps it should not have been 
given at all.  Recent cases have tended to indicate that for reasons of public policy the defense of in pari delicto is 
not available to a defendant in certain types of antitrust cases.  See Perma Life Mufflers, Inc.  v. International Parts 
Corp., 392 U.S. 134, 20 L. Ed. 2d 982, 88 S. Ct. 1981 (1968); [**44]  Gaines v. Carrollton Tobacco Board of Trade, 
Inc., 386 F.2d 757 (6th Cir. 1967); Sahm v. V-1 Oil Company, 402 F.2d 69 (10th Cir. 1968). However, since it has 
been concluded that the instructions given on this defense were correct, it is not necessary to reach the question of 
Appellants'"
581,Counsel,"Counsel: ""I submit to the Court that the same words that were used at the bench as being objectionable were 
used by this counsel to the same effect, that this jury would have to consider the consequences of this type of bargaining, 
eliminating from the whole industry certain people and causing a good deal of harm."" 
The Court: ""The jury is instructed that the execution of the contract itself is not per se a violation of law."" 
Appellants'"
581,Counsel,"Counsel: ""Okay.""
15 Appellants also claim error in the instruction because of remarks made by the District Judge which were incorrect statements 
of certain dates involving passage of the PWC and ""80-cent clause."" In the supplemental instruction the District Judge corrected 
himself and no prejudice resulted from the error.

 
whether the type of antitrust conspiracy involved in this case falls into the category of those antitrust conspiracies in 
which the defense of in pari delicto is available. 
Consolidation's request for instructions on its defenses of assumption of risk of the conspiracy, waiver of rights 
arising from the conspiracy and estoppel were properly rejected by the District Court.  While these defenses might 
be proper in certain negligence and contract cases, there is no evidence that Congress intended that these 
defenses could be set up by analogy as a defense in an antitrust case.  Furthermore, even if these defenses were 
available, it appears that they would be subsumed in the more inclusive defense of in pari delicto. 
H.  Instructions Dealing with the Issue of Bad Business Judgment 
Consolidation also claims that the District Judge negated one of its primary contentions with [**45]  certain remarks 
made in the instructions.  The primary contention allegedly negated by the District Judge's statements was that 
much of the injury South-East sought recovery for did not result from the antitrust conspiracy but rather was caused 
by a ""serious mistake in judgment in building a cleaning plant costing $5 million and at a point some one hundred 
twenty-five miles from the mine . . ."" The remarks made by the District Judge concerned only in a very general 
fashion the importance of a cleaning apparatus  [*785]  in processing bituminous coal and the expensiveness of 
such a device.  There was copious testimony at trial on both sides of the issue of whether the building of the 
cleaning plant by South-East was or was not a mistake in business judgment.  The alleged prejudicial statements 
on this matter were made at the very beginning of the charge during a general discussion of the bituminous coal 
industry when the meaning of certain jargonistic words and phrases used in the coal industry and at the trial were 
explained to the jury.  Towards the end of the instructions, the Judge charged the jury on appellant's bad business 
judgment theory of the cause of South-East's injuries.  [**46]  He stated: 
""The defendants take the position that the (conspiracy did not cause plaintiff's injuries) . . . (but the injuries 
were) the result of either mismanagement, over expansion, economic conditions, or a combination of these, 
with possibly other circumstances, to none of which either of these defendants had any part. 
""That is the theory of the defendants here, that by building this cleaning plant at Irvine, that there was a 
significant miscalculation of its cost of construction, more than a million dollars it anticipated to cost; that it was 
125 miles in haul from the mines to that plant, which was an additional expense and contrary to good coal 
production management, and that by loss of the sale of coal through no fault of Consolidation Coal Company, 
but through the failure of the plaintiff to exercise orthodox business acumen; that that is what caused this 
plaintiff to lose money, and that through its own failures and no reason to accuse either of these defendants to 
have committed wrongful acts; the financial problems of the plaintiff arose from its own actions and its own 
failure to exercise good business judgment in the face of advice on the part of Consolidation [**47]  Coal 
Company, according to Mr. Tucker, I believe, who was the witness -- is that his name? 
Appellants'"
582,Counsel,"Counsel: ""Cassidy."" 
The Court: ""The last witness who testified.  Well, anyway, one of the witnesses for the defendant that he was 
concerned about the building of this tipple and this cleaning plant, and advised the plaintiff, through its 
president, Mr. LaViers, and possibly others, that importation from Canada and other places and the use of gas 
and oil was going to reduce the coal demands thirty-three and a third per cent from locality, or more.  
Notwithstanding that, this plaintiff proceeded to its development and expansion, and that these defendants 
were in no way responsible for it.  But, due to these circumstances alone, if he had any loss, it was caused by 
that.""
If there was a negation of one of appellant's theories by the passing remarks made by the District Judge at the 
beginning of the charge to the jury, it obviously was more than compensated for by the explanation of appellant's 
position just quoted.  It is concluded that appellants were not prejudiced by certain complained of statements made 
by the District Judge in his instructions to the jury. 
II. Alleged [**48]  Errors in Evidentiary Matters 
A.  Evidence of Effects and Consequences of the Alleged Antitrust Conspiracy 

 
The appellants challenge the District Court's ruling on certain evidence offered by South-East which concerned 
economic conditions in the coal industry in Eastern Kentucky.  The evidence was principally statistical and related 
to such things as: the reduction in the number of miners employed in the coal industry, diminution of population in 
certain coal producing areas, wage scales in the bituminous coal industry, quantitive fluctuations in coal production 
in various years, income and losses of certain bituminous coal producing companies.  The objection raised to this 
type of evidence was that it inordinately emphasized alleged ""effects and consequences""  [*786]  of the antitrust 
conspiracy, thereby misleading the jury to believe that the existence of an anti-competitive conspiracy or agreement 
could be inferred from these conditions.  It is argued that this Court's decisions in Lewis v. Pennington, 400 F.2d 
806 (6th Cir. 1968), and Ramsey v. United Mine Workers, 416 F.2d 655 (6th Cir. 1969), and the Supreme Court's 
decision in United Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626, 85 S. Ct. 1585 (1965), [**49]  
specifically rejected the theory that an antitrust conspiracy can be proven by effects and consequences.  The 
argument is not clear, but it appears that objection is not made to the admissibility of this type of evidence, rather 
that this type of evidence standing alone cannot, as a matter of law, serve as the basis for concluding that an 
antitrust conspiracy exists. 
In United Mine Workers v. Pennington the Supreme Court stated that HN12[
] a labor union, having concluded a 
wage agreement with one set of employers, may unilaterally seek to impose the same terms on other employers 
even though it is believed that ""some employers cannot effectively compete if they are required to pay the wage 
scale demanded by the union."" United Mine Workers v. Pennington, at 655, n. 2. It was also observed that ""such 
union conduct is not alone sufficient evidence to maintain a union-employer conspiracy charge under the Sherman 
Act. There must be additional direct or indirect evidence of the conspiracy."" United Mine Workers v. Pennington, Id. 
The textual material, not the language of the footnote quoted above,  [**50]  appears in Lewis v. Pennington and 
Ramsey v. United Mine Workers. Appellants' argument apparently relies upon the language quoted above from the 
Supreme Court's Pennington decision.  They construe this language to mean that evidence of the effects and 
consequences of an alleged conspiracy, e.g., statistics showing marginal producers are losing money and going out 
of business, reduction in the number of individuals employed as coal miners, et cetera, are insufficient to prove an 
antitrust conspiracy. 
It cannot be said definitely that appellants' interpretation of the language in Pennington is either right or wrong.  
While this Court finds it difficult to construe that particular language in Pennington as appellants have, some support 
for appellants' interpretation of that language can be found in Mr. Justice Goldberg's dissenting opinion in 
Pennington appearing in Local Union No. 189, Amalgamated Meat Cutters & Butcher Workmen of North America v. 
Jewel Tea Company, Inc., 381 U.S. 676, 714-0715, 14 L. Ed. 2d 640, 85 S. Ct. 1596 (1965). Even though the 
language in Pennington is not decisive, there is a logical basis for appellants' position.  The [**51]  ""effects and 
consequences"" theory is basically a causal argument.  That is, a cause (the antitrust conspiracy) has produced 
certain results or effects (reduction in the number of people employed in the mines, financial losses by marginal 
producers, et cetera).  This type of argument has one chief flaw: The difficulty in isolating a single factor causally 
responsible for identifiable effects.  Often there are intervening and superseding causes which if shown destroy the 
validity of the argument.  The ""effects and consequences"" theory appellants question appears to simply reverse the 
usually logical progression from cause to effect by first pointing to certain conditions and then concluding what 
caused these conditions.  In any event, the problem of isolating a particular cause which definitely produced certain 
effects is still present.  The law cannot be that an antitrust conspiracy can be proven by alleged effects and 
consequences of the conspiracy alone.  If the only evidence a plaintiff could produce of an alleged antitrust 
conspiracy is statistics showing that they and other producers in an industry are losing money while some 
producers make money; that overall production in the [**52]  industry is down while profits of certain companies are 
up; and that employment has dropped off in the industry, the defendants  [*787]  should have a verdict directed for 
them at the close of plaintiff's case.  Plaintiff would not even have made out a prima facie case for recovery. 
Regardless of how accurate these statements might be, they do not apply under the facts of this case.  Reviewing 
the record, it becomes obvious that contrary to appellants' contention South-East's case does not rest solely on 
alleged effects and consequences to prove the existence of the antitrust conspiracy. South-East presented 
evidence of statements made by UMW and Consolidation officials tending to show that there existed an implied or 
expressed agreement between the Union and Consolidation; there was evidence of past courses of dealing and 

 
performance between itself and Consolidation which were interrupted or changed as a result of Union activity; there 
was evidence concerning what happened at bargaining sessions between South-East and the Union which 
indicated that some agreement other than the National Agreement (the Bituminous Coal Wage Agreement) existed 
between the Union and certain producers.
 [**53]  While the question of the sufficiency of this evidence will be dealt with later, the importance of indicating that 
South-East introduced other evidence from which the existence of an agreement to restrain trade or competition 
could be inferred, is to show that it did not rely solely on alleged effects and consequences of the antitrust 
conspiracy to prove its claim. If the only evidence South-East introduced was the statistical evidence referred to 
earlier, then the case should never have been submitted to the jury.  However, this was not the only proof they 
offered.  Evidence of the type which appellants object to is admissible and can be considered by the jury in drawing 
its conclusion on the issue of liability if there is other evidence which supports the claim.  See generally, Local 175 
of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers v. United States, 219 F.2d 431 (6th Cir. 1955); Standard Oil 
Company of California v. Moore, 251 F.2d 188 (9th Cir. 1957), cert. denied 356 U.S. 975, 2 L. Ed. 2d 1148, 78 S. 
Ct. 1139. Therefore, while appellants' argument might be correct as far as it goes, it does not apply to the facts of 
this case. 
 [**54]  B.  Evidence and Statements which Allegedly Personalized South-East Claims Thereby Prejudicing 
Appellant 
Consolidation maintains they were prejudiced because certain evidence admitted and statements made at the trial 
tended to personalize South-East's claim, that is, gave the impression that it was the claim of the LaViers' family 
which controls and operates the company.  It is contended that this left the jury with the idea that this was a David 
versus Goliath type controversy, with the LaViers family representing the small South-East Coal Company battling 
the combined giant forces of Consolidation Coal Company and the United Mine Workers of America.  Thus, 
appellants argue that because of this characterization, the jury's sympathies had to lie with the underdog South-
East Coal. 
South-East Coal Company, for all intents and purposes, is a family-owned and family -run coal company.  Mr. Harry 
LaViers, Senior, and his son, Harry LaViers, Junior, were the controlling forces behind South-East and made the 
decisions, either good or bad, for the company.  The company, compared to Consolidation, is a small producer of 
coal and its actions are earmarked with the LaViers' name.  While [**55]  there was some personalization of the 
company's claim by occasional interchanging of the name plaintiff with Harry LaViers, Senior or Junior, this was no 
more excessive than might be expected under the circumstances.  In addition appellants, partially as a result of the 
defense of in pari delicto, tended to contribute to any personalization which may have taken place. 
Conceding that some personalization of South-East's claim did occur, it is still difficult to accept appellants' 
argument that this converted the dispute into a  [*788]  small company versus large company controversy, or 
appellants' assumption that a jury's sympathies always rest with the underdog.  Without some additional evidence 
that appellants were in fact prejudiced by these characterizations, the record does not support these assertions, 
and it is concluded that no injury resulted. 
C.  Admissibility of Certain Hearsay Statements 
During the trial, South-East introduced into evidence portions of answers made by the United Mine Workers to 
written interrogatories.  The Union was asked to admit to the authenticity of certain speeches, editorials and 
statements made by Union officials which were appended [**56]  to the Union's answers to the interrogatories, and 
then parts of these documents were read to the jury.  Consolidation objected to and now challenges the 
admissibility of these statements on the grounds that they were hearsay as against them.  (Consol's objection to the 
District Court's refusal to give its requested instruction on this matter was discussed earlier.  See, I. ALLEGED 
ERRORS IN INSTRUCTIONS: Section E. Instructions Respecting the Use to be Made by the Jury of Certain 
Hearsay Statements, supra, at p. 778).  Consol's principal contention is that statements of this type are not to be 
admitted until ""there is independent evidence establishing, prima facie, that such others were members of the 
conspiracy."" Standard Oil Company v. Moore, supra. 

 
HN13[
] The general rule is that this type of evidence is admissible, however, subject to exclusion if no prima facie 
case of the existence of the conspiracy is established.  The question of conditional admissibility is for the trial judge 
to determine.  Carbo v. United States, 314 F.2d 718 (9th Cir. 1963). There [**57]  is no error in conditionally 
admitting the statements before a prima facie case was established by independent evidence if subsequently such 
a case is proven, because the trial judge has wide discretion over the order of proof.  Pennington v. United Mine 
Workers, 325 F.2d 804, 817 (6th Cir. 1963), reversed on other grounds, 381 U.S. 657, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626, 85 S. Ct. 
1585 (1965). Flintkote Company v. Lysfjord, 246 F.2d 368, 378 (9th Cir. 1957), cert. denied, 355 U.S. 835, 2 L. Ed. 
2d 46, 78 S. Ct. 54. At the close of plaintiff's case there had been established by independent or disassociated 
evidence a prima facie case, thus the requirement for having conditionally admitted the statements was met. 
D.  Sufficiency of the Evidence 
Appellants contend that the jury verdict, and the District Court's denial of their motions for directed verdict and 
judgment notwithstanding the verdict are in error, as the verdict ""is not supported by clear evidence, but is contrary 
to undisputed facts and applicable legal principles."" Appellants' argument with regard to the ""clear proof"" standard 
has already been discussed.  See, I. ALLEGED ERRORS [**58]  IN INSTRUCTIONS, Section A.  The Standard of 
Proof Required to Impose Liability, supra, at pp. 772-774. Furthermore, appellants' arguments on applicable legal 
principles have also been dealt with, See, I. ALLEGED ERRORS IN INSTRUCTIONS, pp. 774-785, and what 
remains is the issue of sufficiency of the evidence. 
In considering the sufficiency of the evidence, little if any advantage would be gained by an itemized review of 
plaintiff's case.  Much of the evidence introduced at trial was similar to that used at the trials in Tennessee 
Consolidated Coal v. United Mine Workers and the retrial of the Pennington case in Lewis v. Pennington.  Yet there 
was additional evidence introduced at the trial having particular significance to South-East's claim and which tended 
to emphasize that South-East's case was unique from either Tennessee Consolidated Coal or Lewis.  (A single 
example is the evidence of the circumstances surrounding the cancellation of the sales agency contract between 
Consolidation and South-East in which  [*789]  Consol acted as sales agent for South-East's coal.) While some of 
the evidence introduced was circumstantial, which in and of itself might not support [**59]  the jury's verdict, there 
was also direct evidence which, when coupled with the circumstantial evidence, raised plaintiff's case from one of 
mere suspicion or conjecture to a level where reasonable minds might have concluded liability upon the part of the 
appellants.  After reviewing the record, it is concluded that there was substantial credible evidence to support the 
jury's verdict.  The District Court's decision on this matter was correct and appellants' motions for directed verdict 
and judgment notwithstanding the verdict were properly denied. 
III.  ALLEGED IRREGULARITIES WITH RESPECT TO THE JURY 
A.  Mr. LaViers' Sr. Conversation with Two Jurymen 
Consolidation contends that the District Court committed reversible error in not declaring a mistrial because of a 
conversation Mr. LaViers, Sr., of South-East Coal, had with two members of the jury outside of court during the trial.  
The conversation took place in a coffee shop in the hotel where some of the witnesses, jurors, attorneys and parties 
in the trial were staying.  Mr. LaViers was seated by a waitress at a table which was situated next to another table 
where two jurors were eating breakfast. The District Judge, after [**60]  examining Mr. LaViers, 16 found that 
appellants were not  [*790]  prejudiced by this unintentional contact and declined to grant a mistrial. 
16 The Court made the following examination of Mr. LaViers in ascertaining what took place in the coffee shop: 
(Reporter's note:) ""The following occurred at the bench in the immediate presence of counsel and the Court, and in the absence 
and out of the hearing of the jury: 
""The Court: I want to clarify this other situation before we get into anything else.  This is out of the presence or hearing of the 
jurors, at the bench, in connection with the statement made to the Court by Mr. Schmidt, counsel for the defendant Consolidation 
Coal Company with reference to two of the jurors, Mr. Hill and Mr. Osborne, who were seen in conversation with Mr. Harry 
LaViers, Sr., at the Coffee Shop of the Phoenix Hotel about 7:30 to 8:00 o'clock this morning, October 11, 1968. 
""Now, then, do you want to make any further statement?  I am just asking."" 

 
Off the record. 
(Reporter's note:) ""An off-the-record discussion took place at the bench. 
""The Court: Come here, Mr. LaViers, please.  Mr. LaViers, it has been reported to the Court that this morning in the Coffee Shop 
at the Phoenix Hotel, you, in the presence of Mr. Schmidt and Mr. Rowntree -- 
""Mr. Schmidt: Mr. Rowntree was not present. 
""The Court: No. 
""Mr. Rowntree: As I stated, I was there earlier. 
""The Court: Yes. I don't know who else was there.  But you were seated near or standing near or in the company -- not 'in the 
company,' I don't want to use that term -- but in contact with Mr. Hill and Mr. Osborne, who are members of the jury.  Now, do 
you recall that incident? 
""Mr. LaViers, Sr.: Yes, I do, Your Honor. 
""The Court: Would you mind stating just what it was? 
""Mr. LaViers, Sr.: Yes, Mr. Rowntree had gone down to breakfast prior to my coming down.  When I came into the Coffee Shop, I 
looked for him and found that the table where he was seated only had one chair and I was looking around for some other table 
to sit at, and the head waitress came and said, 'Well, just sit down here' -- which was right across the aisle from Mr. Rowntree -- 
and I sat down on the bench and ordered my breakfast. 
And Mr. Hill was sitting next to me, and he asked me, he said, 'Do you know Mr. Oscar Evans who lives in Paintsville?' 
And I said, 'Well, he doesn't live in Paintsville now; he has gone to Florida -- but I do know Mr. Evans.' 
And he said, 'Well, I used to board at his house.' 
And he said he was quite a character. 
And I said, 'Yes, I agree with that,' and, 'I knew him very well.' 
And then I believe that part of the breakfast, not the main part, was served, and Mr. Hill then asked me if I knew Mr. Nelson 
Howard who lived in Paintsville; and I said yes, 'I know Mr. Nelson Howard; he came from Gallatin County; he was in the 
automobile business there and later was in the coal business, I know him.' Mr. Hill said he used to work for him.  I said, 'Well, he 
was quite an aggressive merchant when he was there, he made a lot of money and decided he would go into the farming 
business and bought a couple of farms down in Bourbon County, and I understand, lost what he had of his investment in these 
farms.' 
I guess the rest of the breakfast was served about that time.  I don't recall that there was -- there was some gentleman came in 
on the other side, and they turned to him to speak to him.  I don't recall any further conversation. 
There was nothing about this lawsuit. 
""The Court: Do you want to ask him a question? 
""Mr. Schmidt: Mr. LaViers, there were other places to sit down in the Coffee Shop besides next to Mr. Hill and Mr. Osborne when 
you sat down?  Isn't that true? 
""Mr. LaViers, Sr.: Well, yes, sir, there are other tables for four and tables for two and the tables at the bench are for two, and the 
head waitress came along and tossed a menu down and just said, 'Sit down here,' and I sat where she put the menu.  I didn't 
seek out this seat. 
""Mr. Schmidt: You saw them sitting there? 
""Mr. LaViers, Sr.: Oh, yes, I saw them sitting there. 
""Mr. Schmidt: Was it in your mind that, even so, it wouldn't hurt to develop some sort of a social rapport with these gentlemen? 
""Mr. LaViers, Sr.: No, Mr. Schmidt, that was not in my mind.  I am by nature a person who talks to people in the elevator or 
wherever it might be, and I would be untruthful and unrealistic if I didn't say I do engage in conversations. 
""The Court: How many minutes would you assume, or how much time, I should say, would you assume your conversation or 
what you stated to the Court, or anything in addition to that, was consumed with either of these men? 

 
 [**61]  Appellants maintain that the case of United States v. Harry Barfield Company, 359 F.2d 120 (5th Cir. 1966), 
controls, and a mistrial should have been granted on the basis of that authority.  Reviewing the decision in United 
States v. Harry Barfield Company, it appears that several facts instrumental to that decision are lacking in the 
present case.  In the Barfield Company case the prejudicial out-of-court conversation took place in an elevator 
between the president of the company and two jurors. The president of the company made an effort to approach 
the jurors and then ""cemented"" the contact by volunteering information that his wife and her family dealt with the 
drug store owned by one of the jurors. The Court observed: 
""By way of summation it is clear that the taxpayer president approached the jurors. They did not approach 
 [*791]  him.  He sought to identify with juror Lockhart through the fact of knowing about his drug business.  He 
then sought to cement the identity by giving the juror his wife's name which led to a conversation regarding his 
wife's family.  He apparently also managed to find out that the juror from the radio station had known his [**62]  
brother.""
(See the dissenting opinion by Judge Colman in the Barfield Company case, at p. 124, questioning the majority's 
characterization of these facts.) 
In the present case Mr. LaViers was seated by a waitress next to the jurors. He did not seek them out.  
Furthermore, it was a juror who approached Mr. LaViers with a question about whether he knew certain individuals.  
Obviously, Mr. LaViers could have simply ignored the juror, but the law does not require that when a person 
becomes a party in a lawsuit that he must renounce all social amenities and rudely ignore people who ask him 
questions.  The juror's questions were answered by Mr. LaViers in a straight-forward polite fashion, without any 
attempt to ingratiate himself to the juror. There was no discussion of the case.  The facts of Barfield Company which 
were of principal significance in that decision are lacking here and the case is clearly distinguishable from the 
present dispute.  While, of course, these types of contacts must be scrupulously avoided if at all possible, the fact 
that in this case the contacts were brought about by a coincidence of circumstances, there was no intentional 
""Mr. LaViers, Sr.: Oh, there were snatches of conversation, I imagine about ten or fifteen minutes.  I was eating breakfast. 
""The Court: That covered the whole period? 
""Mr. LaViers, Sr.: Well, not the whole period of breakfast, but the period of the conversation. 
""The Court: Do you want to ask him anything further? 
""Mr. LaViers, Sr.: Mr. Rowntree has continuously cautioned me about this. 
""The Court: Well, you see the point is, I mean, the Court accepts your statement that you didn't say anything about the case. 
""Mr. LaViers, Sr.: We didn't talk anything about the case, Your Honor. 
""The Court: But, you see, the difficulty is that this more or less currying of favor with a juror -- while I realize it isn't currying a 
favor deliberately -- but it has brought questions to people's minds.  I realize some people are just naturally friendly, and 
Kentuckians are just that way -- I know them pretty well -- but we mustn't do anything like this. 
""Mr. LaViers, Sr.: I would be very, very happy to avoid them. 
""The Court: The Court is confident that you didn't do anything intentionally.  That is the ruling of the Court. 
Now, do you have anything you want to ask him? 
""Mr. Rowntree: No. 
""Mr. Schmidt: May I ask him a question? 
""The Court: Yes, sir. 
""Mr. Schmidt: Mr. LaViers, you have seen each of those gentlemen sit at the same table every morning? 
""Mr. LaViers, Sr.: No, sir, they have not, as far as my knowledge, sat at that same table.  They do sit in the Coffee Shop there at 
various places, but I don't recall seeing them at that particular place, Your Honor.""

 
""seeking-out,  [**63]  "" and no discussion of the case occurred, the District Court's denial of the motion for a mistrial 
was proper and clearly not an abuse of discretion.  United States v. Van Buskirk, 304 F.2d 871 (6th Cir. 1962). 
B.  Alleged Error in the District Court's Refusal to Declare a Mistrial because of Certain Conduct of a Juror 
Appellants contend that they were denied their constitutional right to trial by an impartial jury because the District 
Court refused to grant a mistrial upon learning of certain alleged misconduct of a juror. Two matters are alluded to 
as indicating that the partiality of one juror was questionable.  First, an incident occurred during trial which allegedly 
was misconduct on the part of the juror. An attorney for the Union developed the following facts: the juror and his 
wife attended a social function in Lexington, Kentucky, during the trial. It appeared that the juror's wife was a 
sorority sister and close friend of the wife of a lawyer who practiced in the coal mining area of Eastern Kentucky.  
The juror was also a close friend of the lawyer.  These people met at the social function, and the juror mentioned 
that a third lawyer who practiced in [**64]  the same coal mining region was an attorney for the Union in the trial in 
which he was a juror and that this attorney was ""a very able lawyer."" Then the juror's wife made some comment 
about the present case being difficult ""in following a conspiracy or in following just what they were driving at with all 
the reading and all."" It was not at all clear whether the juror's wife mentioned the word ""conspiracy"" or not. On these 
facts a motion was made to subpoena the juror and the people involved in this incident and examine them.  The 
District Court concluded that ""nothing (had) been shown here to justify an investigation of this juror"" and overruled 
the motion. 
Appellant cites Mattox v. United States, 146 U.S. 140, 36 L. Ed. 917, 13 S. Ct. 50 (1892), as controlling and 
requiring that under these circumstances an examination of the juror should have been granted.  Under the facts in 
Mattox, it was obvious that an examination of the jurors should have taken place.  In that case allegedly a court 
bailiff, present when the jury was deliberating the verdict in a murder case, stated, so that the members of the jury 
could hear him, that ""this is the third fellow he (the accused)  [**65]  has killed."" In addition, during deliberation the 
jury or part of it was read a  [*792]  newspaper account of the trial that included the following remarks: 
""If he (the accused) is not found guilty of murder he will be a lucky man, for the evidence against him was very 
strong, or at least appeared to be to an outsider.  The case was given to the jury at noon yesterday, and it was 
expected that their deliberations would not last an hour before they would return a verdict. 
* * * 
""It (the evidence) was so strong that the friends of Mattox gave up all hope of any result but conviction.""
Under these alleged circumstances, the court should have ordered an examination of the jury to determine the 
accuracy of the purported misconduct.  However, by no stretch of the imagination can it be argued that the facts 
surrounding the present incident of alleged misconduct approximates those in Mattox.  While questions of jury 
improprieties are matters of degree, it cannot be said that the District Court abused its discretion in not ordering an 
examination of the juror and the other participants in the present incident without further representation or a 
stronger indication [**66]  that some misconduct prejudicial to appellants' constitutional right to an impartial trial did 
in fact occur. 
The second matter that appellants point to which they contend shows partiality upon the part of this juror is that his 
insurance agency underwrote a real estate bond for the son of a former official of and present minor stockholder in 
South-East Coal Company.  The juror was challenged for cause, but the District Court overruled the challenge.  The 
examination of the juror showed that a $5,000 surety bond must be posted with the Commonwealth of Kentucky 
before a real estate broker can sell real estate.  The juror's insurance agency underwrites the bond for the son of a 
former official and present minor stockholder in South-East Coal. The bond was first written several years before 
this litigation was commenced and simply has been renewed each year. Until informed, the juror did not know for a 
fact if he wrote the bond for the son or the father and, obviously, knew neither personally.  Upon questioning, he 
stated that the fact he wrote the bond would not affect his judgment in any way.  This case is distinguishable from 
Commonwealth Coatings Corporation v. Continental Casualty Company, 393 U.S. 145, 21 L. Ed. 2d 301, 89 S. Ct. 
337 (1968), [**67]  cited by appellants to support their position that their challenge for cause of this juror should 
have been granted.  In Commonwealth Coatings an individual acting as an arbitrator under a private contractual 
agreement had been an engineering consultant for one of the parties in the dispute and collected over $12,000 in 
fees in four years.  The Supreme Court set aside an award made by the panel of three arbitrators holding that an 

 
arbitrator should disclose to the parties any dealings which might create an impression of possible bias. Factually 
and legally, the present case is different.  Here a juror had only remote indirect contact with a party in a lawsuit.  
Even if the business contacts were more direct, all that Commonwealth Coatings requires is a disclosure of these 
dealings.  In the present case, the nature and extent of the juror's business contacts were disclosed and the District 
Court, upon examination of the juror, concluded that he could impartially hear the evidence and return a verdict free 
of any prejudice that might result from his business dealings.  The District Court's refusal to grant the challenge for 
cause of this juror was not an abuse of discretion.  [**68]  Holt v. United States, 218 U.S. 245, 54 L. Ed. 1021, 31 S. 
Ct. 2 (1910); Cox v. General Electric Company, 302 F.2d 389 (6th Cir. 1962). 
IV.  Damages 
A.  The Jury Award of Damages 
South-East sought damages allegedly resulting from the anti-competitive conspiracy in this case for a three and one 
half year period from April 26, 1962, to December 31, 1966.  Two methods of computing these damages were 
 [*793]  used to arrive at a dollar amount. 17 [**69]  The first method was a simple comparison between operating 
profits and losses 18 during the period 1952-1958, an arbitrary base period, with the operating profit and losses for 
the period South-East sought recovery.  A method similar to this was used in determining the antitrust damages in 
Bigelow v. RKO Radio Pictures, 327 U.S. 251, 258, 90 L. Ed. 652, 66 S. Ct. 574 (1946), and Ford Motor Company 
v. Webster's Auto Sales, Inc., 361 F.2d 874, 885-886 (1st Cir. 1966). 
The second method was more complex and was designed to meet certain objections appellants had to the first 
method.  This method used various financial and managerial figures for the years 1964 and 1965 for a comparison 
with similar figures in 1962, 1963 and 1966.  Thus, statistics during the actual damages period (1964 and 1965) 
acted as a basis for computing damages for the entire period.  Supporting this theory, South-East introduced six 
financial exhibits showing, in part: the effects higher mining costs and decreased production in 1962, 1963 and 
1966 had on earnings compared to the base years 1964-1965; the effect on earnings of two strikes in 1962-1963 
and 1966 as compared with earnings in 1964-1965; lower price realization on coal in 1964-1965 than in the 
remaining years of the damage period; and [**70]  the alleged effect the conspiracy had on South-East's price 
realization per ton of coal compared with the average price realization of the industry for the period 1962-1965.  
South-East maintains that by using this approach appellant's challenge to the validity of using figures for 1952-1958 
for the comparison, because allegedly during the damage period internal and external economic conditions were 
less favorable than during 1952-1958, are effectively negated. 
Appellants raise numerous issues regarding the validity of South-East's theories of damages.  Mention of four of the 
challenges will give some idea of the general nature of appellants' attacks.  Respecting South-East's first method of 
computing damages, appellants contend that using the profit average of 1952-1958 for the comparison is unfair as 
""internal and external economic factors,"" i.e. less favorable mining conditions and a general overall depression in 
the coal market, varied between the years used as a basis and the actual damages period.  The second method is 
challenged on the grounds that use of new equipment during 1964 invalidates the comparison of the financial and 
managerial date with the base period 1962-1963.  [**71]  The third objection is that both methods claim losses for 
Consolidation's refusal to handle South-East's coal and that these losses cannot be recovered from the Union.  
Finally, appellants complain that South-East's computed losses which were in part a result of its inability to get 
sufficient railroad cars to ship its coal and, therefore, were in no way attributable to the alleged conspiracy. 
It appears that most of appellants' challenges to South-East's claims of damages are directed at the accuracy of the 
amount of damages and not the fact of damages.  There was a general issue raised as to the lack of evidence 
17 Computation of injuries by the first method produced a damages figure of $3,082,816.  The damages figure produced by the 
second method was $2,896,713.  The jury awarded damages of $2,410,452 or approximately $700,000 less than the damages 
computed by the first method and $500,000 less than computed by the second method.
18 Figures reflecting operating profit and losses rather than net income were used because these figures do not include such 
things as percentage depletion allowances which are treated as return of capital, interest payments (expenses) or income, 
capital gains and losses and dividend income.

 
showing that the proximate cause of South -East's damages was the conspiracy; that is, the sufficiency of evidence 
showing the fact of damages.  However, reviewing the record, it is clear that there was sufficient credible evidence 
from which the jury was justified in inferring the necessary causal relation between the conspirators'  [*794]  anti-
competitive conduct and the claimed damage or injury.  Zenith Radio Corporation v. Hazeltine Research, 395 U.S. 
100, 125, 23 L. Ed. 2d 129, 89 S. Ct. 1562 (1969). The antitrust cases are legion which reiterate [**72]  the 
proposition that, HN14[
] if the fact of damages is proven, the actual computation of damages may suffer from 
minor imperfections.  See, Story Parchment Company v. Paterson Parchment Paper Company, 282 U.S. 555, 75 L. 
Ed. 544, 51 S. Ct. 248 (1931); Bigelow v. RKO Radio Pictures, supra; Zenith Radio Corporation v. Hazeltine, supra; 
Ford Motor Company v. Webster's Auto Sales, Inc., supra; Atlas Building Products Company v. Diamond Block & 
Gravel Company, 269 F.2d 950, 958 (10th Cir. 1959); North Texas Producers Association v. Young, 308 F.2d 235, 
245 (5th Cir. 1962); Flintkote Company v. Lysfjord, 246 F.2d 368, 392 (9th Cir. 1957). 
Appellants' principal grounds for objection to the jury verdict is that internal and external economic conditions and 
decisions of the management resulted in South-East's losses, and not the conduct of the alleged conspiracy. But 
HN15[
] the question of whether certain of South-East's [**73]  losses were attributable to the conspiracy or other 
economic factors was for the jury's consideration and determination, Cherokee Laboratories, Inc. v. Rotary Drilling 
Services, Inc., 383 F.2d 97, 106 (5th Cir. 1967), cert. denied, 390 U.S. 904, 19 L. Ed. 2d 870, 88 S. Ct. 816, as is 
the question of the credibility of the witnesses used in showing damages, Atlas Building Products Company v. 
Diamond Block & Gravel Company, supra at 959. It is concluded that there was sufficient credible evidence to 
support the jury's verdict as to the fact of damages and the amount of damages was computed as precisely as 
capable under the circumstances. 
B.  Attorneys' Fees 
Appellants object to the award of attorneys' fees as unreasonable.  HN16[
] A party seeking review of an award of 
attorneys' fees in an antitrust case has the burden of clearly demonstrating error in the factual basis of the award or 
an abuse of discretion.  See, Armco Steel Corporation v. State of North Dakota, 376 F.2d 206, 213 (8th Cir. 1967); 
Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation v. Goldwyn, 328 F.2d 190, 221 (9th Cir. 1964). [**74]  In this case 
appellants have not shown either an error in the factual basis of the award or an abuse of discretion. 
The judgment is affirmed.

686,Counsel,"Counsel: Frederic H. Lawrence and Paul C. Gouldin for appellant.  I.  Plaintiff lacks jurisdictional standing to 
maintain the first cause [****5]  of action alleged in the complaint.  Loss of business resulting from allegedly illegal 
acts of a competitor does not give a plaintiff standing to sue such competitor.  (Empire City Subway Co. v. 
Broadway & Seventh Ave. R. R.  Co., 87 Hun 279, 159 N. Y. 555; Geneva-Seneca Elec. Co. v. Economic Power &

Co. v. Short, 203 Misc.  979, 283 App. Div. 779.) IV. The first cause of action should be dismissed because the 
provisions of subdivisions 2 and 3 of section [****6]  65 of the Public Service Law, prohibiting the granting of any 
undue or unreasonable preference, are not applicable to electric service to be rendered a State, municipal or 
Federal body under contract.  ( Matter of O'Sullivan v. Feinberg, 201 Misc. 658; Staten Is. Edison Corp. v. New

required because of respondent's failure to give requisite notice to the Attorney-General.  ( Matter of Aimcee 
Wholesale Corp., 21 N Y 2d 621; Manhattan Stor. & Warehouse Co. v. Movers Assn., 289 N. Y. 82.)
Robert M. Diggs for respondent.  I. Respondent, a public utility which furnishes gas for space heating, has standing 
to challenge the legality under the Public Service Law of appellant's discriminatory and preferential charges for 
electricity, which injure respondent by inducing customers to use electricity instead of gas for space heating.  ( 
Brooklyn City R. R. Co. v. Whalen, 191 [****8]  App. Div. 737, 229 N. Y. 570; DeMatteis v. McGoldrick Realty Co., 
259 N. Y. 452; Kingsbridge Ry. Co. v. City of New York, 204 App. Div. 369; Surface Transp. Corp. v. Reservoir Bus 
Lines, 271 App. Div. 556; International Ry. Co. v. Barone, 246 App.  Div. 450; Association of Data Processing Serv. 
Organizations v. Camp, 406 F. 2d 837.) II. Appellant cannot escape the prohibitions in section 65 of the Public 
Service Law against unreasonable, discriminatory and preferential charges by serving municipal customers under 
special contracts neither filed with nor approved by the Public Service Commission.  ( Nashville Ry. v. Tennessee, 
262 U.S. 318; New York Tel. Co. v. Siegel-Cooper Co., 202 N. Y. 502.) III. The complaint alleges a cause of action 
under the Donnelly Act by setting forth facts establishing that appellant is abusing its monopolistic position in the 
lighting market to restrict the freedom of municipalities to choose among competing energy sources in the space 
heating market.  ( Northern Natural Gas Co. v. Federal Power Comm., 399 F. 2d 953; Matter of Aimcee Wholesale 
Corp., 21 N Y 2d 621; Northern Pac. Ry. Co.  [****9]  v. United States, 356 U.S. 1; United States v. Loew's, Inc., 
371 U.S. 38; Fortner Enterprises v. U.  S. Steel, 394 U.S. 495; Times-Picayune v. United States, 345 U.S.  594.) IV.
