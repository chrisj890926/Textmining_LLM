Frank, Elizabeth M. O'Neill, Richard M. Weinberg and Alice McInerney of counsel), for appellant.  I. Exclusive 
territorial vertical restraints are covered by the Donnelly Act.  ( Columbia Gas v New York State Elec. & Gas. Corp., 
28 NY2d 117; State of New York v Glen & Mohawk Milk Assn., 61 NY2d 705; Matter of Aimcee Wholesale Corp.

Alexander's Dept. Stores v Ohrbach's, Inc., 266 App Div 535, 291 NY 707.) II. The Attorney-General is 
authorized [****5]  to investigate all restraints of competition.  ( Sanders v Winship, 57 NY2d 391; Matter of 
Smathers, 309 NY 487; Eiberger v Sony Corp. of Am., 622 F2d 1068; State of New York v Mobil Oil Corp., 38 NY2d

Richard Nash, Henry B. Gutman, Douglas Richards, Richard C. Stein and Matthew Feigenbaum for respondents.  I. 
The Attorney-General lacks [****6]  authority to investigate vertical territorial arrangements because such restraints 
are legal under New York law.  ( Matter of Kates v Lefkowitz, 28 Misc 2d 210; Stemmerman v Kelly, 150 App Div 
735, 220 NY 756; Dawn to Dusk v Brunckhorst Co., 23 AD2d 780; Revlon Prods. Corp. v Bernstein, 204 Misc 80,

1; Bradford v New York Times Co., 501 F2d 51; Matter of Davies, 168 NY 89.) II. The per se legality of vertical 
exclusive territories requires that the subpoenas be quashed.  ( Matter of Kates v Lefkowitz, 28 Misc 2d 210.) III. 
The Attorney-General's Federal lawsuit vitiates any legitimate purpose the subpoenas might have had.  ( People v 
Anaconda Wire & Cable Co., 45 Misc 2d 151, 23 AD2d 823, 16 NY2d 871;  [****7]  Dellwood Foods v Abrams, 109
