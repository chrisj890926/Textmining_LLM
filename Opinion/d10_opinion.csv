7,Counsel,"Counsel: Mr. John G. Johnson and Mr. John G. 
Milburn, with whom Mr. Frank L. Crawford was on the 
brief, for appellants: 
The acquisition in 1899 by the Standard Oil Company of 
New Jersey of the stocks of the other companies was 
not a combination of independent enterprises.  [****8]  
All of the companies had the same stockholders who in 
the various corporate organizations were carrying on 
parts of the one business.  The business as a whole 
belonged to this body of common stockholders who, 
commencing prior to 1870, had as its common owners 
gradually built it up and developed it.  The properties 
used in the business, in so far as they had been 
acquired by purchase, were purchased from time to time 
with the common funds for account of the common 
owners.  For the most part the plants and properties 
used in the business in 1899 had not been acquired by 
purchase but were the creation of the common owners.  
The majority of the companies, and the most important 
ones, had been created by the common owners for the 
convenient conduct of branches of the business.  The 
stocks of these companies had always been held in 
common ownership.  The business of the companies 
and their relations to each other were unchanged by the 
transfer of the stocks of the other companies to the 
Standard Oil Company of New Jersey. 
The Sherman Act has no application to the transfer to, 
or acquisition by, the Standard Oil Company of New 
Jersey of the stocks of the various manufacturing and 
producing [****9]  corporations, for the reason that such 
transfer and acquisition were not acts of interstate or 
foreign commerce, nor direct and immediate in their 
effect on interstate and foreign commerce, nor within the 
power of Congress to regulate interstate and foreign 
commerce.  United States v. Knight, 156 U.S. 1; In re 
Greene, 52 Fed. Rep. 104. 
The contracts, combinations and conspiracies of § 1 of 
the Sherman Act are contracts and combinations which 
contractually restrict the freedom of one or more of the 
parties to them in the conduct of his or their trade, and 
combinations or conspiracies which restrict the freedom 
of others than the parties to them in the conduct of their 
business, when these restrictions directly affect 
interstate or foreign trade.  Purchases or acquisitions of 
property are not in any sense such contracts, 
combinations or conspiracies.  Contracts in restraint of 
trade are contracts with a stranger to the contractor's 
business, although in some cases carrying on a similar 
one, which wholly or partially restricts the freedom of the 
contractor in carrying on that business as otherwise he 
would.  Holmes, J., in Northern Securities Case, 193 
U.S. 404; Pollock on Contracts,  [****10]  7th ed., p. 
352.  Such contracts are invalid because of the injury to 
the public in being deprived of the restricted party's 
industry and the injury to the party himself by being 
precluded from pursuing his occupation.  Oregon Steam 
Navigation Co. v. Windsor, 20 Wall. 68; Alger v. 
Thacker, 19 Pick. 54. Combinations in restraint of trade 
are combinations between two or more persons 
whereby each party is restricted in his freedom in 
221 U.S. 1, *1; 31 S. Ct. 502, **502; 55 L. Ed. 619, ***619; 1911 U.S. LEXIS 1725, ****6

 
carrying on his business in his own way.  Hilton v. 
Eckersley, 6 El. & Bl. 47. 
The cases in which combinations have been held invalid 
at common law as being in restraint of trade deal with 
executory agreements between independent 
manufacturers and dealers whereby the freedom of 
each to conduct his business with respect to his own 
interest and judgment is restricted.  Morris Run Coal Co. 
v. Barclay Coal Co., 68 Pa. St. 173; Salt Co. v. Guthrie, 
35 Oh. St. 666; Arnot v. Pittston and Elmira Coal Co., 68 
N.Y. 558; Craft v. McConoughy, 79 Illinois, 346; India 
Bagging Association v. Kock, 14 La. Ann. 168; Vulcan 
Powder Co. v. Hercules Powder Co., 96 California, 510; 
Oil Co. v. Adoue, 83 Texas, 650; Chapin v. Brown, 83 
Iowa, 156. 
The cases in which trusts and [****11]  similar 
combinations have been held invalid as combinations in 
restraint of trade all deal with devices employed to 
secure the centralized control of separately owned 
concerns.  People v. North River Sugar Refining Co., 54 
Hun, 354; S.C., 121 N.Y. 582; State v. Nebraska 
Distilling Co., 29 Nebraska, 700; Pocahontas Coke Co. 
v. Powhatan Coal & Coke Co., 60 W. Va. 508. 
A conspiracy in restraint of trade is a combination of two 
or more to deprive others than its members of their 
freedom in conducting their business in their own way 
by acts having that effect.  A combination to boycott is a 
sufficient illustration. 
The Sherman Act did not enlarge the category of 
contracts, combinations and conspiracies in restraint of 
trade.  United States v. Trans-Missouri Association, 166 
U.S. 290; United States v. Joint Traffic Association, 171 
U.S. 505; Addyston Pipe & Steel Co. v. United States, 
175 U.S. 211; Montague v. Lowry, 193 U.S. 38; Swift v. 
United States, 196 U.S. 375; Loewe v. Lawlor, 208 U.S. 
274; Continental Wall Paper Co. v. Voight & Sons, 212 
U.S. 227, all involved combinations, either expressly by 
the terms of the agreements constituting them, 
restricting the freedom of each of the [****12]  members 
in the conduct of his or its business, or in the nature of 
conspiracies to restrict the freedom of others than their 
members in the conduct of their business.  The Northern 
Securities Case, 193 U.S. 197, was a combination 
which, through the device adopted, restricted the 
freedom of the stockholders of two independent railroad 
companies in the separate and independent control and 
management of their respective companies. 
Purchases and acquisitions of property do not restrain 
trade.  The freedom of a trader is not restricted by the 
sale of his property and business.  The elimination of 
competition, so far as his property and business is 
concerned, is not a restraint of trade, but is merely an 
incidental effect of the exercise of the fundamental civil 
right to buy and sell property freely.  The acquisition of 
property is not made illegal by the fact that the 
purchaser intends thereby to put an end to the use of 
such property in competition with him.  Every purchase 
of property necessarily involves the elimination of that 
property from use in competition with the purchaser and, 
therefore, implies an intent to effect such elimination.  
Cincinnati Packet Co. v. Bay, 200 U.S. 179. 
 [****13]  The transfer to, and acquisition by, the 
Standard Oil Company of New Jersey of the stocks of 
the various corporations in the year 1899 was not, and 
the continued ownership of those shares with the control 
which it confers is not, a combination or conspiracy in 
restraint of trade declared to be illegal by the first 
section of the Sherman Act.  Because of the common 
ownership of the different properties in interest they 
were not independent or competitive but they were the 
constituent elements of a single business organism.  
This situation was not affected by the transfer to the 
Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, who had the 
same body of stockholders and had controlled the 
separate companies and continued to control them 
through the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey.  
These considerations differentiate the present case from 
the Northern Securities Case, 193 U.S. 197. The 
Northern Securities Case dealt with a combination of 
diverse owners of separate and diverse properties 
which were bound by the law of their being as quasi-
public corporations invested with public franchises to 
continue separate, independent and competitive, 
creating through the instrumentality of the holding 
company [****14]  a common control which would 
necessarily prevent competitive relations. 
There is no warrant for the assumption that corporations 
engaged in the same business are naturally or 
potentially competitive regardless of their origin or 
ownership.  If the same body of men create several 
corporations to carry on a large business for the 
economical advantages of location or for any other 
reason, and the stocks of these corporations are all in 
common ownership, it is a fiction to say that they are 
potentially competitive or that their natural relation is 
one of competition. 
The common owners of the Standard Oil properties and 
business had the right to vest the properties and 
221 U.S. 1, *1; 31 S. Ct. 502, **502; 55 L. Ed. 619, ***619; 1911 U.S. LEXIS 1725, ****10

 
business in a single corporation, notwithstanding that 
such a transaction might tend to prevent the 
disintegration of the different properties into diverse 
ownerships.  The Sherman Act does not impose 
restrictions upon the rights of joint owners. 
The acquisitions prior to 1882 were lawful and their 
effect upon competition was incidental.  The purpose of 
the trust of 1879 was to bring the scattered legal titles to 
the joint properties then vested in various individuals 
into a single trusteeship.  The purpose of the 
Trust [****15]  Agreement of 1882 was to provide a 
practicable trusteeship to hold the legal title to the joint 
properties, an effective executive management and a 
marketable symbol or evidence of the interest of each 
owner.  The only question raised in the case of State v. 
Standard Oil Company, 49 Oh. St. 137, was whether it 
was Ultra vires for the Standard Oil Company of Ohio to 
permit its stock to be held by the trustees instead of by 
the real owners.  The method of distribution adopted on 
the dissolution of the trust was the only feasible plan of 
distribution.  Each certificate-holder was given an 
assignment of his proportionate interest in all the 
companies.  All being parts of the common business 
there was no basis for separate valuations.  The value 
of the interest of every owner was dependent upon its 
being kept together as an entirety.  The transaction of 
1899 was practically an incorporation of the entire 
business by the common owners through the ownership 
of the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey.  That was 
the plain purpose, object and effect of the transaction. 
The first section of the Sherman Act deals directly with 
contracts, combinations and conspiracies in restraint of 
trade.  The [****16]  second section deals directly with 
monopolizing and attempts to monopolize.  
Monopolizing does not enlarge the operation of the first 
section nor does its absence restrict the operation of 
that section. 
The first section deals with entities, a contract, 
combination, a conspiracy; and the entities themselves 
are expressly declared to be illegal, and may be 
annulled or destroyed.  The second section deals with 
acts. 
At common law monopoly had a precise definition.  
Blackstone, Vol. 4, p. 160; Butchers' Union Co. v. 
Crescent City Co., 111 U.S. 756. Monopoly imports the 
idea of exclusiveness and an exclusiveness existing by 
reason of the restraint of the liberty of others.  With the 
commonlaw monopoly the restraint resulted from the 
grant of the exclusive right or privilege.  Under the 
Sherman Act there must be some substitute for the 
grant as a source of the exclusiveness and restraint 
essential to monopolizing.  The essential element is 
found in the statement of Judge Jackson ( In re Greene, 
52 Fed. Rep. 116) that monopolizing is securing or 
acquiring ""the exclusive right in such trade or commerce 
by means which prevent or restrain others from 
engaging therein."" Exclusion by competition [****17]  is 
not monopolizing.  Pollock on Torts, 8th ed., p. 152; 
Mogul Case, L.R. 23 Q.B.D. 615; (1892) App. Cas. 51. 
Monopolizing within the act is the appropriation of a 
trade by means of contracts, combinations or 
conspiracies in restraint of trade or other unlawful or 
tortious acts, whereby ""the subject in general is 
restrained from that liberty of . . . trading which he had 
before."" In the absence of such means or agencies of 
exclusion, size, aggregated capital, power, and volume 
of business are not monopolizing in a legal sense. 
 Swift v. United States, 196 U.S. 375, was the case of a 
combination of corporations, firms and individuals 
separately and independently engaged in the business, 
together controlling nearly the whole of it, to monopolize 
it by certain acts and course of conduct effective to that 
end when done and pursued by such a combination. 
 Richardson v. Buhl, 77 Michigan, 632; People v. North 
River Sugar Refining Co., 54 Hun, 354; State v. 
Standard Oil Co., 49 Oh St. 137; State v. Distillery Co., 
29 Nebraska, 700; Distilling Co. v. People, 156 Illinois, 
448, and Anderson v. Shawnee Compress Co., 209 
U.S. 423, rest upon special grounds and are not 
applicable to this case.  [****18]  See on the other hand, 
In re Greene, 52 Fed. Rep. 104, Jackson, J.; Trenton 
Potteries Co. v. Oliphant, 58 N.J. Eq. 507; Oakdale Co. 
v. Garst, 18 R.I. 484; State v. Continental Tobacco Co., 
177 Missouri, 1; Diamond Match Co. v. Roeber, 106 
N.Y. 473; Davis v. Booth & Co., 131 Fed. Rep. 31; 
Robinson v. Brick Co., 127 Fed. Rep. 804. The 
acquisition of existing plants or properties however 
extensive, though made to obtain their trade and 
eliminate their competition, is not a monopoly at 
common law or monopolizing under the Sherman Act, in 
the absence of the exclusion of others from the trade by 
conspiracies to that end or contracts in restraint of trade 
on an elaborate and effective scale, or other systematic, 
wrongful, tortious or illegal acts.  When such 
monopolizing is present the remedy of the act is to 
prohibit the offending conspiracies, contracts, and illegal 
acts or means of exclusion, leaving the individual or 
corporation to pursue his or its business with the 
properties and plants that have been acquired or 
created shorn of the monopolizing elements in the 
conduct of the business. 
221 U.S. 1, *1; 31 S. Ct. 502, **502; 55 L. Ed. 619, ***619; 1911 U.S. LEXIS 1725, ****14

 
The acquisition of competing plants and properties 
cannot be rendered unlawful by imputing to [****19]  
such acquisitions an intent to monopolize.  The 
acquisition of plants and properties does not exclude 
anyone from the trade and therefore the intent to 
monopolize cannot be attributed to such acquisitions.  
The proposition that an acquisition of property is 
rendered invalid because of a collateral intent to 
monopolize is not sustained by the authorities relied 
upon to support it.  Addyston Pipe Case, 85 Fed. Rep. 
291, and cases there cited.  The substantial acquisitions 
made by the owners of the Standard Oil business 
antedated the Sherman Act and they resulted from 
separate transactions extending over a long period of 
years.  They were in all cases accretions to an existing 
business.  They formed an insignificant part of the 
business as it now exists.  The Sherman Act is intended 
to prevent present monopolizing or attempts to 
monopolize.  Whether acquisitions made many years 
ago were or were not associated with an attempt to 
monopolize has no relation with the present attempt at 
monopolizing. 
The Standard Oil Company of New Jersey was not 
monopolizing, or attempting to monopolize, or 
combining with anyone else to monopolize, interstate 
and foreign trade in petroleum and its products [****20]  
when this proceeding was instituted, or at any time. 
The ownership of the pipe lines has not been a means 
of monopolizing.  Substantially all of the pipe lines 
owned by the Standard Oil companies have been 
constructed by those companies.  There has never been 
any exclusion of anyone from the oil fields either in the 
production of oil, or its purchase, or its storage, or its 
gathering or transportation by pipe lines.  Ownership of 
the pipe lines does not give the Standard companies 
any advantages in dealing with the producers which are 
not open to others. 
The decree erroneously includes and operates upon 
several of the appellant companies. 
The sixth section of the decree is unwarranted and 
impracticable in various of its provisions. 
It was error to deny the motion of the appellants to 
vacate the order permitting service upon them outside of 
the Eastern Division of the Eastern District of Missouri, 
and to set aside the service upon them of the writs of 
subpoena issued thereunder; and error to overrule the 
pleas of the appellants to the jurisdiction of the court 
over them.  The appellants were not residents of the 
Eastern District of Missouri nor were they found therein 
when the [****21]  order was made authorizing the 
service of process upon them outside of the district.  
There was no proceeding pending in that district 
involving a controversy for the determination of which 
the appellants were necessary parties. 
Mr. D. T. Watson, also for appellants: 
The Government has failed to maintain the affirmative of 
the issue made by the pleadings.  Brent v. The Bank, 10 
Pet. 614; The Siren, 7 Wall. 154; United States v. 
Stinson, 197 U.S. 200, 205. 
The transfer in 1899 to the Standard Oil Company of 
New Jersey of the various non-competitive properties 
jointly used by them as one property was not a 
restriction of interstate trade, or an attempt to 
monopolize, or a violation of the Sherman Act. 
The Sherman Act permits trusts, combines, corporations 
and individuals to enter into and compete for interstate 
trade so long as they act lawfully.  It does not seek to 
regulate the methods nor forbid those who enter into 
trade from doing their business in the form of a trust, 
corporation or combine, provided they carry it on 
lawfully. 
The Standard Oil Company of New Jersey after 1899 
might legitimately and properly compete for interstate 
trade, notwithstanding the combination [****22]  of the 
group of properties gave it a great power, only provided 
it did not restrain such trade or by unlawful means seek 
to gain a monopoly contrary to the provisions of the 
Sherman Act. 
There is nothing in this case to show that after 1899 the 
combination did unlawfully compete, restrict or seek to 
monopolize interstate trade; yet such evidence was 
indispensable to prove that the combination was 
violating the Sherman Act in 1906.See the Calumet & 
Hecla Case, Judge Kanappen, 167 Fed. Rep. 709, 715; 
Judge Lurton, 167 Fed. Rep. 727, 728; Judge Gray in 
United States v. Reading Co., decided December 8, 
1910. 
There is a great difference between the Northern 
Securities Case and the case at bar. 
On the question of potential competition, the idea of 
competition between properties all owned by the same 
persons is a novelty.  The idea that properties 
themselves compete, and that if one man owns two or 
more he must compete with himself, is startling.  
Competition between joint owners is also novel.  
Fairbanks v. Leary, 40 Wisconsin, 642, 643; Whitwell v. 
Continental Tobacco Co., 125 Fed. Rep. 454. 
221 U.S. 1, *1; 31 S. Ct. 502, **502; 55 L. Ed. 619, ***619; 1911 U.S. LEXIS 1725, ****18

 
Competition is the striving of two or more persons, or 
corporations, either individually [****23]  or jointly, for 
one thing, i.e., trade; it is personal action; the strife 
between different persons.  Properties do not compete.  
Their relative locations may more readily enable their 
owners to use them in competition, but of themselves 
and as against each other, they do not compete. 
This idea makes the Sherman Act read that the same 
person or group of individuals shall not own and operate 
two or more sites for refineries or for stores or for any 
kind of manufactories which might be used by different 
owners in competition.  Joint Traffic Association Case, 
171 U.S. 505, 567. 
The words ""potential"" or ""naturally competitive"" are not 
in the Sherman Act.  Cascade Railroad Co. v. Superior 
Court, 51 Washington, 346. The rule of potential 
competition refers only to the ownership of the physical 
properties which produce the oil which goes into 
interstate commerce, and not to the oil itself.  United 
States v. E.C. Knight Co., 156 U.S. 1; Northern 
Securities Co. v. United States, 193 U.S. 407. 
The Sherman Act is a highly penal one.  In a criminal 
prosecution under the act the degree of proof is beyond 
a reasonable doubt.  In a civil suit under it, the degree is 
not so great, but the proof [****24]  must be direct, plain 
and convincing.  United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight 
Assn., 58 Fed. Rep. 77; Northern Securities Co. v. 
United States, 193 U.S. 197, 401; State v. Continental 
Tobacco Co., 177 Mississippi, 1. 
There is a distinction between private traders and 
railroad companies; and see also distinction under 
Sherman Act between quasi-public corporations and 
private traders.  Trans-Missouri Case, 166 U.S. 290. 
The mere method in which stocks are held is not 
prescribed by the Sherman Act; all methods are lawful if 
not used to restrict trade or gain an unlawful monopoly.  
Under the court's ruling the effectiveness of a large 
business organization may, by reason of that very fact, 
bring it under the Sherman Act. 
The decree below was not justified by the facts found by 
the court; or by the Sherman Act; after the court in § 5 
permitted the distribution among the shareholders of the 
Standard Oil Company of New Jersey of the stocks held 
by that company, it did without lawful authority so to do, 
define and limit the method of that distribution; restrict 
the distributees in the future sale, use and disposal of 
their stocks; restrict the distributees in the sale, use and 
disposal [****25]  of their properties; and in the contract 
relations thereafter to exist, as well as the use and 
disposition of the different properties in such a drastic 
manner as to greatly injure and destroy the value of the 
same and render their future profitable use practically 
impossible.  The decree disintegrates properties built 
with appellants' moneys for joint use so as to create 
units that never before existed and compels these units 
separately to carry on business and compete with other 
units, directly contrary to the purpose of their creation.  It 
allows the future operation and use of the refineries, 
pipe lines, and other properties of the appellants only 
under the vague and indefinite, but broad and 
comprehensive, terms of § 6 of the decree, by 
subjecting those who in the future operate them to 
attachment for contempt for unwittingly violating vague 
and indefinite terms.  It prohibits appellants from 
engaging in all interstate commerce until the 
discontinuance of the operation of the illegal 
combination, thus inflicting a new penalty for an 
indefinite and uncertain period. 
All of such restrictions are unauthorized by the Sherman 
Act, are in violation of the settled rules 
governing [****26]  injunctions, and are contrary to the 
provisions of the different decrees heretofore approved 
by this court under the Sherman Act, and especially the 
one in the Northern Securities Case. 
The decree authorized by the Sherman Act is wholly 
negative, and one that merely enjoins -- stops an illegal 
thing in operation when the petition is filed or which then 
is foreseen.  Lacassagne v. Chapius, 144 U.S. 124; 
E.C. Knight Co. Case, 156 U.S. 1, 17; Harriman v. 
Northern Securities Co., 197 U.S. 244, 289; Swift & Co. 
v. United States, 196 U.S. 375, 402; United States v. 
Reading Co., decided by Circuit Court of the Third 
Circuit, December 8, 1910. 
The Sherman Act prescribes certain specific methods of 
relief which are exclusive of all others.  Noyes on 
Intercorporate Relations, 2d ed., 1909, § 406; Greer, 
Mills & Co. v. Stoller, 77 Fed. Rep. 1, 3; Minnesota v. 
Northern Securities Co., 194 U.S. 48, 71; Barnet v. 
National Bank, 98 U.S. 555, 558; East Tennessee R.R. 
Co. v. Southern Tel. Co., 112 U.S. 306, 310; Farmers' 
Bank v. Dearing, 91 U.S. 29, 35; United States v. Union 
Pacific Railroad Co., 98 U.S. 569. 
The decree hampers and greatly injures the value of the 
stock of the stockholders,  [****27]  though they are not 
parties to the bill. 
A corporation, when party to a bill in equity, does 
represent its stockholders, but only within the scope of 
221 U.S. 1, *1; 31 S. Ct. 502, **502; 55 L. Ed. 619, ***619; 1911 U.S. LEXIS 1725, ****22

 
corporate power, and not as to the individual rights of 
the stockholder to do with his property as he chooses.  
Taylor & Co. v. Southern Pacific Co., 122 Fed. Rep. 
147, 153, 154. A corporation has no right to conclude or 
affect the right of any shareholder in respect of the 
ownership or incidents of his particular shares.  Brown 
v. Pacific Mail Steamship Co., Fed. Cas. No. 2025; 5 
Blatch. 525; Morse v. Bay State Gas Co., 91 Fed. Rep. 
944, 946; Harriman v. Northern Securities Co., 197 U.S. 
244, 288-290. 
The decree follows the appellants and their properties 
after the dissolution. 
The Sherman Act closely limits and defines the power of 
the court on a petition filed to give equitable relief.  The 
petition must pray that such violations shall be enjoined 
or otherwise prohibited; and it is these violations of the 
act that the court may now enjoin, and only such 
violations.  Past unlawful competition does not deprive 
parties of their right to conduct lawful competition.  New 
Haven R.R. Case, 200 U.S. 361, 404. 
The Sherman Act does not [****28]  give power to the 
courts to strike down and disintegrate a non-competing 
group of physical properties used to manufacture an 
article of trade.  These physical properties are bought 
and held and used under state laws; they do not enter 
into interstate commerce and hence are not under 
Federal control.  New Haven R.R. Co. v. Interstate Com. 
Comm., 200 U.S. 361, 404; State v. Omaha Elevator 
Co., 75 Nebraska, 637. 
The effect of the decree is ruinous.  For instance, these 
companies jointly own 54,616 miles of pipe lines, of 
which the seven individual defendants and their 
associates built over 50,000 miles, in which they have 
an investment of over $61,000,000. 
The decree splits up this pipe line system into eleven 
parts, takes away from the owners, who jointly built the 
pipe lines and who created the sub-companies, all 
control over the different sub-companies, and compels 
the eleven different parts to stand alone, independently 
of their principal and of each other, to be hostile to and 
to compete with their principal and with one another. 
Pipe lines are never parallel but always continuous, and 
each line has a value which depends wholly upon its 
connection with other parts of the system,  [****29]  and 
whether all are used together as one whole.  The 
carrying out of the decree would cut the pipe line system 
into isolated segments, prevent such use, and make the 
successful operation of the pipe lines impossible. 
The decree would especially destroy the value of the 
stock of all shareholders who each had five shares or 
less.  The stockholders on August 19, 1907, holding 
from one to four shares each numbered 1,157, and the 
stockholders owning five shares each numbered 439, 
out of a total number of 5,085 stockholders. 
Considering the case de novo, and not on the findings 
of the court below, it is not true that when the petition in 
this case was filed in 1906, the seven individual 
appellants and their associates, private traders in oil, 
were, contrary to the provisions of the Sherman Act, 
carrying on a conspiracy to restrain interstate and 
foreign trade in oils, and to gain by illegal means a 
monopoly thereof. 
The Federal law allowed and allows each of the 
individuals to compete freely for the interstate and 
foreign traffic in oil and its products.  He may use all the 
weapons that his ingenuity and skill can suggest, to 
wage a successful warfare.  His rights to compete are 
not [****30]  limited to merely such means as are fair or 
reasonable, but are only limited to such as are unlawful 
and directly tend to the violation of the Sherman Act.  
The Federal law also allows and assures to each 
competitor whatever share, however large, of the 
interstate or foreign trade in oil he or they may win 
provided his means are not unlawful.  The Sherman Act 
was passed to protect trade and further competition.  It 
makes such restraint and monopoly a crime and inflicts, 
on conviction, severe penalties for such offense.  It 
permits one set of competitors to purchase the property 
of other competitors solely to avoid further competition.  
The mere size of the competing corporations or 
combinations is immaterial. 
The monopoly of a trade at common law was forbidden 
because, and only because, it excluded all others from 
practicing such trade, and seems to have been then 
limited to a royal grant, as, for example, giving the 
exclusive right to manufacture playing cards.  It was and 
is a distinct thing from engrossing, regrating or 
forestalling the market, all of which were based on the 
prevention of artificial prices for the necessaries of life.  
No one of these falls under Federal jurisdiction, 
 [****31]  but each is subject to state control only. 
The present litigation is between the Federal 
Government and certain of its citizens.The questions 
involved are solely the rights of these Federal citizens 
and the effect upon those rights of the Sherman Act, 
and whether these Federal citizens have violated the 
provisions of that act. 
There was and is no such thing as a Federal crime,

aside from express congressional acts, and as no such 
act was in existence prior to 1890, as to the matters 
charged in the petition, all the matters and things done 
by the defendants prior thereto are immaterial. 
This case involves, and only involves, the question of 
the restraint and monopolization of interstate and 
foreign trade in oil in November, 1906, when the petition 
was filed; it does not involve any alleged restraint or 
monopoly of the oil industry in any of the States. 
The appellants were lawfully entitled to so hold and use 
in interstate trade all of its combined properties. 
To succeed in this case, the Government must also 
show that the said Standard Oil Company was then in 
1906 using its power to actually restrain interstate or 
foreign trade in oil, or was then in 1906 excluding or 
attempting [****32]  to exclude by illegal means others 
from said trade and attempting to monopolize the same, 
or a part thereof. 
The Sherman Act does not compel private traders, 
however organized, to compete with each other.  The 
character of the oil business was and is such that a 
great corporation was and is an economic necessity for 
carrying on that industry.  The growth and success of 
the Standard Oil Company was the result of individual 
enterprise and the natural laws of trade.  It was not the 
result of unlawful means, but of skill, unremitting toil, 
denials and hardships, and is an instance of where the 
continuous use for forty years of skill, labor and capital 
reached a great success. 
To prove a violation of § 1 of the Sherman Act the 
Government must clearly show that when the petition 
was filed appellants were then actually restraining 
interstate trade in oil. 
To prove a monopoly under § 2 of the Sherman Act, the 
Government must show that the appellants were, when 
the petition was filed, then using unlawful means to 
maintain their control of the industry and that the 
appellants were then by unlawful means excluding 
others from said industry.

 [****33]  with whom Mr. Cordenio N. Severance was on 
the brief, for the United States: 
It is immaterial that this conspiracy had its inception 
prior to the enactment of the Sherman Law, or that 
many of the rebates and discriminations granted by the 
railroads which enabled the defendants to monopolize 
the commerce in petroleum antedated the enactment of 
the Interstate Commerce Act; the principles of the 
common law applied to interstate as well as to intrastate 
commerce.  Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Call Pub.

From the earliest date these various corporations were 
held together by trust agreements which were void at 
common law.  But whether they were void or not, the 
combination was a continuing one; there was no vested 
right by reason of the acquisition of these 
stocks [****34]  by the trustees, and when the Sherman 
Act was passed the continuance of the combination 
became illegal.  United States v. Freight Association,

The Standard Oil Company, through various defendant 
subsidiary corporations is engaged in producing and 
purchasing crude petroleum in Pennsylvania, West 
Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Oklahoma, Kansas and 
California; in transporting the same by pipe lines from 
the States in which the same is produced into the 
various other States to the manufactories of the various 
defendants; in manufacturing the same into the products 
of petroleum and transporting those products, largely in 
the tank cars of the Union Tank Line Company 
(controlled by the Standard Oil Company of New 
Jersey) to the various marketing places throughout the 
United States, and in selling and disposing of the same.  
This clearly makes the defendants engaged in interstate 
commerce.  Swift [****35]  & Co. v. United States, 196

The Northern Securities Case and other 
authorities [****36]  cited under this head are conclusive 
of the proposition that this is a combination in restraint 
of trade.  The court held that the inhibitions of the 
Sherman Act were not limited to those direct restraints 
upon trade and commerce evidenced by contracts 
between independent lines of railway to fix rates or to 
maintain rates, or manufacturing or other corporations to 
limit the supply or control prices; that the power of 
suppression of competition and therefore of restraint of 
trade exercised or which could be exercised by reason 
of stock ownership and control of the various 
corporations, was as much in violation of the Anti-trust 
Act as direct restraint by contract.  There is nothing in 
the act which can be construed to prohibit the 
suppression of competition by reason of stock control of 
railways and at the same time to permit it in 
manufacturing industries, pipe line companies, or car 
line companies engaged in the manufacture and 
transportation of oil.  The contracts, combinations in the 
form of trusts or otherwise, or conspiracies in restraint of 
trade, which are inhibited by the first section of the act 
as applied to these classes of corporations cannot be 
distinguished from those [****37]  contracts, 
combinations in the form of trusts or otherwise, or 
conspiracies in restraint of trade, when applied to 
railway companies.  The thing inhibited is the restraint of 
interstate commerce.  The thing to be accomplished is 
the maintenance of the freedom of trade.  The inhibition 
against the suppression of competition by any 
instrumentality, scheme, plan or device, to evade the 
act, applies to all corporations and all devices.  The real 
point is not the instrumentality or the scheme used to 
suppress the competition, but whether competition is 
thus suppressed and trade restrained and monopolized.  
Nowhere in the decisions of this court is there authority 
for the proposition that combinations by stock ownership 
or the purchase of competing properties is invalid as to 
railroads but valid as to trading and manufacturing 
companies.  The act of Congress and the decisions of 
this court, so far as the principle goes, places them 
upon the same plane.  In the argument of the Freight 
Association cases it was urged by counsel that the 
inhibitions of the Sherman Act in this regard did not 
apply to railroads, but only included trading companies.  
It is now urged that they apply to railroads [****38]  and 
do not apply to manufacturing and trading companies.  
But this court in the Freight Association cases clearly 
laid down the rule that while there are points of 
difference existing between the two classes of 
corporations, yet they are all engaged in interstate 
commerce, that the injuries to the public have many 
common features, and that the inhibitions apply to all.  
166 U.S. 322. 
The transfer of the stocks of these companies in 1899 to 
the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey had no 
greater legal sanctity than the transfer to the trustees in 
1882, nor was it different from the transfer of the stocks 
of the Northern Pacific and Great Northern Railways to 
the Northern Securities Company in 1901, two years 
after the organization of the present corporate Standard 
Oil combination.  It is the usual course of reasoning 
urged in all of these trust cases -- because a person has 
a right to purchase property, he may therefore purchase 
a competitor, and because he may purchase one 
competitor he may purchase all of his competitors, and 
what an individual may do a corporation may do.  These 
were the identical arguments pressed with great ability 
by counsel in the Northern Securities Case and [****39]  
in the subsequent case of Harriman v. Northern 
Securities Co., 197 U.S. 291; but this court held to the 
contrary.  The position is also contrary to the almost 
universal trend of the American decisions both Federal 
and state.  The exercise of an individual right 
disconnected from all other circumstances may be legal, 
but when taken together with the other circumstances 
may accomplish the prohibited thing. 
The second section of the act prohibits a person or a 
single corporation from monopolizing or attempting to 
monopolize any part of the commerce of the country by 
any means whatever, and also from conspiring with any 
other person or persons to accomplish the same object.  
The two sections of the act were manifestly not intended 
to cover the same thing; otherwise the second section 
would be useless.  Any contract or combination in the 
form of a trust or otherwise, or conspiracy in restraint of 
trade which tends to monopoly is prohibited by the first 
section.  Addyston Pipe Case, 175 U.S. 211; United 
States v. Northern Securities Co., 193 U.S. 334. 
221 U.S. 1, *1; 31 S. Ct. 502, **502; 55 L. Ed. 619, ***619; 1911 U.S. LEXIS 1725, ****35

 
The question then is: What is the meaning of the word 
""monopoly,"" as used in the second section of the act?  
Of course Congress did not [****40]  have in mind 
monopoly by legislative or executive grant.  National 
Cotton Oil Co. v. Texas, 197 U.S. 129; Burrows v. Inter. 
Met. Co., 156 Fed. Rep. 389, opinion by Judge Holt.  
Such monopolies could not exist in this country except 
by grant of Congress or the States, and it has been held 
that exclusive grants to pursue an ordinary legitimate 
business are void.  Butchers' Union Co. v. Crescent City 
Co., 111 U.S. 754. Neither did Congress have in mind 
an absolute monopoly.  This can only be obtained by 
legislative grant.In a country like ours, where everyone 
is free to enter the field of industry, no absolute 
monopoly is probable.It is sufficient to bring it within the 
act if the combination or the aggregation of capital 
""tends to monopoly . . . or are reasonably calculated to 
bring about the things forbidden."" Waters-Pierce Co. v. 
Texas, 212 U.S. 86. Originally monopoly meant a grant 
by sovereign power of the exclusive right to carry on any 
employment.  The only act of exclusion was the grant 
itself.  If the grant was void, then there was no 
monopoly.  These monopolies were common in all 
monarchial countries.  Monopoly, however, came to 
have a broader meaning under the common law 
in [****41]  the later days, and expecially in the United 
States, and in order to arrive at what Congress intended 
by the act of 1890 it is important to understand the 
history of the times and the general understanding of 
monopoly as defined by the courts and the political 
economists, and the monopolies which were known to 
the people generally and against which Congress was 
legislating.  Prior to the passage of this law, the various 
trust cases had been decided, in which trusts, like the 
Standard Oil of 1882, had been held illegal because 
they tended to create a monopoly.  People v. North 
River Sugar Refining Co., 54 Hun, 354; State v. 
Nebraska Distilling Co., 29 Nebraska, 700; State v. 
Standard Oil Co., 49 Oh. St. 137. Various other 
decisions had defined monopoly as known in this 
country, -- such cases as Alger v. Thacher, 19 Pick. 51; 
People v. Chicago Gas Trust, 130 Illinois, 268; Salt Co. 
v. Guthrie, 35 Oh. St. 666; Craft v. McConoughy, 79 
Illinois, 346; Central R.R. Co. v. Collins, 40 Georgia, 
582. 
These cases were decided before the Sherman Act was 
passed, and defined monopoly at common law as it was 
understood and existed in this country.  They embrace 
trusts like the Standard Oil trust;  [****42]  agreements 
fixing prices, dividing territory, or limiting production, 
thereby tending to enhance or control the price of 
products; general agreements restraining individuals 
from engaging in any employment except as incident to 
the sale of property; purchases by corporations of all or 
a large proportion of competing manufacturing or 
mechanical plants; combinations of separate 
businesses in the form of partnership but really for the 
purpose of controlling the trade; and various other forms 
of acquiring monopoly.There was no unlawful exclusion 
of anyone else from doing business in these cases.  
They show that the term ""monopoly"" as applied in 
American jurisprudence meant monopoly acquired by 
mere individual acts, as distinguished from grant of 
government, although the individual act in and of itself 
was not illegal; the concentration of business in the 
hands of one combination, corporation, or person, so as 
to give control of the product or prices; as said by Mr. 
Justice McKenna, in the Cotton Oil Case, ""all 
suppression of competition, by unification of interest or 
management."" 
The case of Craft v. McConoughy, supra, well illustrates 
this argument.  The pretended copartnership 
formed [****43]  between the dealers of the town of 
Rochelle, while carrying on the business separately, 
enabled them to control the prices to the detriment of 
the surrounding country.  It was therefore a 
monopolizing or an attempt to monopolize a part of the 
commerce of the State; and the monopolization would 
have been just as effective had these separate business 
enterprises been stock corporations and the stock 
placed in the hands of a holding company.  A similar 
illustration was the case of Smiley v. Kansas, 196 U.S. 
447 (affirming 65 Kansas, 240), in which an attempt to 
control the grain trade of a particular station was held 
illegal under a state statute.  The Standard combination 
is an attempt to control and monopolize a vast 
commerce of the entire country, as these people 
undertook to control and monopolize a local commerce. 
The term ""monopoly,"" therefore, as used in the 
Sherman Act was intended to cover such monopolies or 
attempts to monopolize as were known to exist in this 
country; those which were defined as illegal at common 
law by the States, when applied to intrastate commerce, 
and those which were known to Congress when the act 
was passed.  The monopoly most commonly known in 
this [****44]  country, and which the debates in 
Congress 1 show were intended to be prohibited by the 
act, were those acquired by combination (by purchase 
or otherwise) of competing concerns.  The purchase of 
1 Cong. Rec., Vol. 21, part 3, pp. 2456-2460, 2562, 2645, 
2726, 2728, 2791, 2928; Cong. Rec., Vol. 21, part 5, pp. 4089, 
4093, 4098, 4101; Vol. 21, part 6, p. 5954.
221 U.S. 1, *1; 31 S. Ct. 502, **502; 55 L. Ed. 619, ***619; 1911 U.S. LEXIS 1725, ****39

 
a competitor, as a separate transaction standing alone, 
was the exercise of a lawful privilege, not in and of itself 
unlawful at common law nor prohibited by statute, yet in 
the Northern Securities Case the purchase of stock in a 
railway was held to be illegal when done in pursuance of 
a scheme of monopoly. 
It is not necessary in this case, and we doubt whether in 
any case it is possible, to make a comprehensive 
definition of monopoly which will cover every case that 
might arise.  It is sufficient if the case at bar clearly 
comes within the provisions of the act.  We believe that 
the defendants have acquired a monopoly by means of 
a combination of the principal manufacturing concerns 
through a holding company; that they have, by reason of 
the very size of the combination, been able to maintain 
this monopoly through unfair [****45]  methods of 
competition, discriminatory freight rates, and other 
means set forth in the proofs.  If this act did not mean 
this kind of monopoly, we doubt if there is such a thing 
in this country.  The men who framed the Constitution of 
this country were familiar with the history of monopolies 
growing out of acts of the Government.  They guarded 
the people against these by constitutional provisions, 
but they left open the widest field for the exercise of 
individual enterprise, and it was the abuse of these 
personal privileges, made easy by state laws permitting 
unlimited incorporation, which gave rise to the evils that 
convinced the people of the necessity for the passage of 
the Sherman Anti-trust Act.  It was not monopolies as 
known to the English common law, but monopolies such 
as were commonly understood to exist in this country 
which that act prohibited. 
As a natural conclusion from the foregoing definition of 
monopoly by appellants' counsel they claim that the 
inhibitions of the second section are against the 
unlawful means used to acquire the monopoly, but that 
acquired monopoly is not illegal; therefore that the court 
can only restrain the means by which the monopoly was 
acquired,  [****46]  leaving the monopoly to exist.  We 
believe this to be an altogether too refined construction 
of the act.  If such be the true interpretation, the result 
would be that one could combine all the separate 
manufactures in a given branch of industry in this 
country by use of unlawful means such as 
discriminatory freight rates, but, if not attacked by the 
Government before it had obtained complete control of 
the business, its very size, with its ramifications through 
all the States, would make it impossible for anyone else 
to compete, and it could control the price of products in 
the entire country and would be beyond the reach of the 
law.  It could, by selling at a low price where a 
competitor was engaged in business and by raising the 
price where there was no attempt at competition, 
absolutely control the business without itself suffering 
any loss; and yet the Government would be powerless 
to destroy the monopoly because the unlawful means 
had been abandoned. 
If the court finds this combination to be in restraint of 
trade and a monopoly, it is authorized by § 3 to enjoin 
the same and has plenary power to make such decree 
as is necessary to enforce the terms and provisions of 
the act.  [****47]  Northern Securities Co. v. United 
States, 193 U.S. 336, 337, 344; Swift & Co. v. United 
States, 196 U.S. 375; United States v. Marigold, 9 How.

Evidence that the defendant companies obtained 
rebates and discriminatory rates in the transportation of 
their product as against their competitors, and engaged 
in unfair and oppressive methods of competition thereby 
destroying the smaller manufacturers and dealers 
throughout the country, is material in this case.  State of 
Missouri v. Standard Oil Co., 218 Missouri, 1; State of 
Minnesota v. Standard Oil Co., 126 N.W. Rep. 527;

A person or corporation joining a conspiracy after it is 
formed, and thereafter aiding in its execution, becomes 
from that time as much a conspirator as if he originally 
designed and put it into operation.  United States v.
