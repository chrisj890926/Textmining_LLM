 [*12]  On August 8, 2006, the Court held a Final Approval Hearing to address the Motions for Final Approval of 
Settlement and for Attorneys' Fees, Expenses and Incentive Award. In preparation for the Hearing, Meijer filed, on 
August 1, 2006, additional Memoranda in support of these Motions as well as a second Declaration by Attorney 
Small (""Small Declaration II"") and an Affidavit from Thomas R. Glenn, Senior Vice President and Chief Operating 
Officer of Complete Claims Solutions, Inc. (""CCS""), the firm hired to act as Settlement Administrator. These 
submissions provided the Court with the following updated information regarding the Settlement Class and Fund: 
approximately sixty-eight 4 identified Class Members had responded to the Notice which had been mailed to them 
and were therefore eligible to receive allocation from the Settlement Fund (Thomas R. Glenn Aff. P 13), no 
objections or Notices of Appearance had been filed, and only one Settlement Class Member - Costco Wholesale 
Corporation (""Costco"") - had requested exclusion from the Class. (Id. P 15.) After factoring in accrued interest and 
the appropriate reversion to 3M to account for Costco's exclusion, the Settlement Fund totaled [*13]  $ 
27,783,836.97 as of August 1, 2006. (Mem. in Further Support of Pls.' Mot. for Final Approval of Settlement at 5 
n.6.). Meijer's submissions also indicated that Plaintiffs' Counsel would request an award of $ 7.5 million in 
attorneys' fees and a reimbursement of $ 390,452.46 in expenses, and that Meijer would request an incentive 
award of $ 25,000. The Court confirmed these facts at the Hearing and then considered the final certification of the 
Settlement Class, the final approval of the proposed Settlement, and the final approval of the requested attorneys' 
fees, expenses, and incentive award. 
 [*14]  II. FINAL CLASS CERTIFICATION
""The Third Circuit has declared that HN1[
] class actions created for the purpose of settlement are recognized 
under the general scheme of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, provided that the class meets the certification 
requirements under the Rule."" Pozzi v. Smith, 952 F. Supp. 218, 221 (E.D. Pa. 1997) (citingIn re General Motors 
Corp. Pick-Up Truck Fuel Tank Prods. Liab. Litig., 55 F.3d 768, 792-97 (3d Cir. 1995)). The Settlement Class was 
preliminarily certified on March 28, 2006; the Class, however, may not be finally certified for settlement purposes 
unless it fully satisfies the requirements laid out in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a) and (b). See In re Cmty. 
Bank of N. Va., 418 F.3d 277, 299 (3d Cir. 2005) (noting that ""the ultimate inquiry into the fairness of the settlement 
under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e) does not relieve the court of its responsibility to evaluate Rule 23(a) and (b) 
considerations""). In the settlement context, the requirements of Rule 23(a) and (b) call for [*15]  heightened judicial 
scrutiny. See, e.g., In re General Motors, 55 F.3d at 784;  Amchem Prods.,Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 621, 117 
S. Ct. 2231, 138 L. Ed. 2d 689 (1997) (stating that the full satisfaction of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) and (b) criteria as a 
prerequisite to certification is even more important when the case is to be settled without trial). HN2[
] The United 
States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit (""Third Circuit"") has summarized the legal standard for class 
certification as follows: 
To be certified, a class must satisfy the four threshold requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a): 
(1) numerosity (a ""class [so large] that joinder of all members is impracticable""); (2) commonality (""questions of 
law or fact common to the class""); (3) typicality (named parties' claims or defenses ""are typical . . . of the 
4 Sixty-eight refers to the number of clearly non-duplicative responses that CCS had received from identified Class Members as 
of August 1, 2006. CCS received a total of seventy-two responses from identified Class Members, but four were identified as 
potentially duplicative. (Glenn Aff. P 13.) CCS also received thirty requests for inclusion in the Settlement Class from entities 
believing that they may be Class Members; of those requests, two entities were identified as additional Class Members, sent 
Notice, and given the opportunity to respond and become eligible to receive allocation from the Settlement Fund. (Id. P 14.) As 
of the Final Approval Hearing on August 8, 2006, no response from those entities had been received; their responses, however, 
did not need to be postmarked until August 7, 2006 (Id.), and thus may have been validly outstanding at the time of the Hearing. 
For greater detail regarding the Notice Plan, see infra Section III. A. 
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 56744, *11

 
class""); and (4) adequacy of representation (representatives ""will fairly and adequately protect the interests of 
the class""). In addition to the threshold requirements of Rule 23(a), parties seeking class certification must 
show that the action [*16]  is maintainable under Rule 23(b)(1), (2), or (3). Rule 23(b)(3) . . . provides for so-
called ""opt-out"" class actions [sic] suits. Under Rule 23(b)(3), two additional requirements must be met in order 
for a class to be certified: (1) common questions must ""predominate over any questions affecting only 
individual members"" (the ""predominance requirement""), and (2) class resolution must be ""superior to other 
available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy"" (the ""superiority requirement"").
In re Warfarin Sodium Antitrust Litig., 391 F.3d 516, 527 (3d Cir. 2004)(internal citations omitted).
For the reasons given below, the Court finds that the proposed Settlement Class satisfies the requirements of Rule 
23(a) and (b)(3), and thus the Court certifies the Class for settlement purposes.
A. Rule 23(a) Factors 
1. Numerosity
HN3[
] When determining whether a proposed class is sufficiently large such that joinder of all members of the 
class is impractical, the Third Circuit has noted that ""[n]o minimum number of plaintiffs is required . . ., but generally 
if the named plaintiff demonstrates that the potential number of plaintiffs [*17]  exceeds forty, the first prong of Rule 
23(a) has been met."" Stewart v. Abraham, 275 F.3d 220, 226-27 (3d Cir. 2001) (citing 5 James Wm. Moore et al., 
Moore's Federal Practice § 23.22[3][a] (Matthew Bender 3d ed. 1999)). In addition to evaluating the absolute size of 
the proposed class, courts may consider other characteristics of the class when assessing numerosity, such as the 
geographic dispersion of class members. 5 Moore's Federal Practice § 23.22[1][d] (Matthew Bender 3d ed. 2006); 
see also In re Corel Corp. Inc. Sec. Litig., 206 F.R.D. 533, 540 (E.D. Pa. 2002) (noting that plaintiffs' argument that 
""joinder is impracticable due to the geographic dispersion of class members"" supports a finding of numerosity). 
Here, information supplied from 3M's sales records indicates that the Settlement Class consists of at least 143 
Members, who are headquartered in at least 35 different states. (Thomas R. Glenn Aff. P 5; Leffler Decl. Table 1.) 
Accordingly, the Court finds that the Settlement Class satisfies the numerosity requirement of Rule 23(a). 
2. Commonality
HN4[
] ""The [*18]  commonality requirement will be satisfied if the named plaintiffs share at least one question of 
fact or law with the grievances of the prospective class. Because the requirement may be satisfied by a single 
common issue, it is easily met. . . ."" Baby Neal v. Casey, 43 F.3d 48, 56 (3d Cir. 1994) (citations omitted). The 
Court notes that the ""numerous common questions of law and fact"" that this Court found to be present in Bradburn 
are also present in this case. See Bradburn, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16193, 2004 WL 1842987, at *3. Namely, all 
members of the Settlement Class must establish: the proper definition of the relevant product and geographic 
market; whether 3M has monopoly power in the relevant market; whether 3M acquired monopoly power through 
anti-competitive activity; and whether 3M's anti-competitive conduct caused tape prices to be artificially inflated. As 
Meijer shares multiple questions of law and fact with the proposed Class, the Court finds that Rule 23(a)'s 
commonality requirement is satisfied. 
3. Typicality
HN5[
] The concepts of commonality and typicality are broadly defined and tend to merge."" Baby Neal, 43 F.3d at 
56. ""'[A] plaintiff's [*19]  claim is typical if it arises from the same event or course of conduct that gives rise to the 
claims of other Class members and is based on the same legal theory.'"" T.B. v. School Dist. of Phila., 1997 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 19300, Civ. A. No. 97-5453, 1997 WL 786448, at *4 (E.D. Pa. Dec. 1, 1997) (quoting Paskel v. Heckler, 
99 F.R.D. 80, 83 (E.D. Pa. 1983)) (alteration in original). The named plaintiffs' claims need only be sufficiently 
similar to those of the class such that ""the named plaintiffs have incentives that align with those of absent class 
members so that the absentees' interests will be fairly represented."" Georgine v. Amchem Prods., Inc., 83 F.3d 610, 
631 (3d Cir. 1996), aff'd subnom. Amchem Prods., 521 U.S. 591, 117 S. Ct. 2231, 138 L. Ed. 2d 689. Here, Meijer's 
claims are typical of the claims of the members of the proposed Class. Both Meijer and all Settlement Class 
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 56744, *15

 
Members allegedly have been injured by the same anti-competitive conduct of 3M, and purportedly suffered 
overcharges as a result. Accordingly, the Court finds that the typicality requirement is satisfied. 
4. Adequacy of representation
HN6[
] The adequacy of the class representative [*20]  is dependant on satisfying two factors: 1) that the plaintiffs' 
attorney is competent to conduct a class action; and 2) that the class representatives do not have interests 
antagonistic to the interests of the class."" In Re Linerboard Antitrust Litig., 203 F.R.D. 197, 207 (E.D. Pa. 
2001)(citations omitted). With respect to the first factor, Class Counsel have submitted firm resumes (Small Decl. 
PP 62-64, Exs. 8, 9A, 10A) which attest to their extensive experience in antitrust and other class action litigation 
and their successful prosecution of such cases in courts throughout the country. The Court, therefore, finds that 
Class Counsel is competent to conduct this class action.
he second factor that must be considered when evaluating adequacy ""serves to uncover conflicts of interest 
between named parties and the class they seek to represent."" Amchem Prods., 521 U.S. at 625. For this factor to 
be satisfied, ""a class representative must be part of the class and 'possess the same interest and suffer the same 
injury' as the Class members."" E. Tex. Motor FreightSys. Inc. v. Rodriguez, 431 U.S. 395, 403, 97 S. Ct. 1891, 52 L. 
Ed. 2d 453 (1977) (quoting [*21]   Schlesinger v. Reservists Comm. to Stopthe War,418 U.S. 208, 216, 94 S. Ct. 
2925, 41 L. Ed. 2d 706 (1974)); see also Georgine, 83 F.3d at 630 (finding class representative inadequate 
because the proposed settlement made ""important judgments on how recovery is to be allocated among different 
kinds of plaintiffs, decisions that necessarily favor some claimants over others""). Consequently, the adequacy of 
representation requirement is not satisfied where ""the named representative's interest in maximizing its own 
recovery provides a strong incentive to minimize the recovery of other class members."" Yeager's Fuel, Inc. v. Pa. 
Power & Light Co.,162 F.R.D. 471, 478 (E.D. Pa. 1995).
Meijer is capable of providing adequate representation for the absent Class Members. Meijer, as a purchaser of 
both brand and private label tape from 3M, has the same interest in this antitrust claim as the absent Class 
Members do: namely, to challenge and obtain damages for 3M's anti-competitive conduct. The potential concern 
regarding the adequacy of Meijer's representation is Meijer's decision to seek these damages under an 
""overcharge"" theory as opposed to an alternate [*22]  ""lost profits"" theory. See Bradburn Parent/Teacher Store, Inc. 
V. 3M, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3347, Civ. A. No. 02-7676, 2004 WL 414047, at *4 (E.D. Pa. Mar. 1, 2004). Rule 
23(a)(4), however, asks the Court to examine the interests of the class representative, not its litigation decisions. 
Meijer's decision to pursue the common interest of the proposed Class through one theory of recovery as opposed 
to another does not compromise the adequacy of Meijer's representation unless the record demonstrates that such 
a decision will work to the detriment of absent Class Members. See Bradburn, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16193, 2004 
WL 1842987, at *6 (rejecting the argument that ""the mere risk that the theory [of damages] proposed by Plaintiff will 
be less well received than a competing theory which could be put forward by other potential class members is 
sufficient for the Court to find the existence of an imminent and apparent potential conflict"").
While the lost profits theory is a means of pursuing damages available to the Settlement Class, Meijer's decision to 
pursue an overcharge theory is not antagonistic to the interests of the Class. Meijer has submitted a declaration 
from Keith Leffler, Ph.D., an Associate Professor [*23]  at the University of Washington, which indicates that it is 
highly likely that every Class Member's overcharge remedy is larger than its lost profits remedy and, even if a Class 
Member has a larger lost profits claim, the burden and difficulty of proving such a claim would overwhelm its 
additional value. (Leffler Decl. P 6.) The Court also finds it significant that, in the years since the LePage's verdict, 
no potential member of the proposed Meijer Class pursued a lost profits claim and Kmart, the one such entity to file 
an individual action, chose to pursue an overcharge remedy rather than a lost profits remedy. Complaint at P 4, 
Kmart Corp. v. 3M Co., Civ. A. No. 05-3842 (E.D. Pa. July 25, 2005). Thus, since Class Counsel is competent to 
conduct a class action, and since Meijer does not have interests in this action that are antagonistic to the interests 
of the Members of the proposed Settlement Class, the Court finds that Meijer satisfies the adequacy of 
representation requirement.
B. Rule 23(b)(3) Factors 
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 56744, *19

 
1. Predominance
HN7[
] Rule 23(b)(3) requires that ""the questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate 
over any questions affecting [*24]  only individual members."" Fed. R. Civ.P. 23(b)(3). ""The Rule 23(b)(3) 
predominance inquiry tests whether the class is sufficiently cohesive to warrant adjudication by representation, and 
mandates that it is far more demanding than the Rule 23(a)(2) commonality requirement."" In re Life USA Holding 
Inc., 242 F.3d 136, 144 (3d Cir. 2001) (citing Amchem, 521 U.S. at 623-24). The difficulty of demonstrating 
sufficient class cohesion naturally varies depending on the nature of the claim, but ""'[p]redominance is a test readily 
met in certain cases alleging . . . violations of the antitrust laws.'"" In re Warfarin, 391 F.3d at 528 (quoting Amchem, 
521 U.S. at 625).
The Court finds that common questions of law and fact predominate in this case. The substance of this antitrust 
claim derives from the anti-competitive conduct of 3M and ""does not depend on the conduct of individual class 
members."" Id.The success of the claim hinges on matters of common, class-wide proof; the evidence that proves 
the violation as to one Class Member proves it as to all Class Members. See In re Linerboard, 203 F.R.D. at 
220 [*25]  (finding predominance requirement satisfied where ""[p]laintiffs have shown that they plan to prove 
common impact by introducing generalized evidence which will not vary among individual class members.""). 
""Finally, the fact that plaintiffs allege purely an economic injury . . . and not any physical injury, further supports a 
finding of commonality and predominance because there are little or no individual proof problems in this case 
otherwise commonly associated with physical injury claims."" In re Warfarin, 391 F.3d at 529. Accordingly, the Court 
finds that Rule 23(b)(3)'s predominance requirement is met. 
2. Superiority
HN8[
] ""The superiority requirement [of Rule 23(b)(3)] 'asks the court to balance, in terms of fairness and 
efficiency, the merits of a class action against those of alternative available methods of adjudication.'"" In re 
Warfarin, 391 F.3d at 533-34 (quoting In re Prudential Ins. Co. of Am. Sales Practice Litig., 148 F.3d 283, 316 (3d 
Cir. 1998)). The considerations relevant to this determination are: 
(A) the interest of members of the class in individually controlling the prosecution and defense [*26]  of 
separate actions; (B) the extent and nature of any litigation concerning the controversy already commenced by 
or against members of the class; (C) the desirability or undesirability of concentrating the litigation of the claims 
in the particular forum . . . . 5 
Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3). 
Here, a class action is superior [*27]  to other methods of adjudication. There appears to be little interest on behalf 
of the Members of the proposed Class in litigating their claims individually. Roughly half of the Members of the 
proposed the Class have under $ 1 million in total tape purchases from 3M (Leffler Decl. Table 1), and the potential 
recovery of these Class Members would be just a fraction of that amount - a sum easily subsumed by the various 
fees and expenses of a complex antitrust suit against a large corporate defendant such as 3M. See In re Warfarin, 
391 F.3d at 534; see also Orloff v. Syndicated Office Sys., Inc., 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7151, Civ. A. No. 00-5355, 
2004 WL 870691, at *5 (E.D. Pa. Apr. 22, 2004) (finding a class action to be the superior method of adjudication, 
""because it ""provides an efficient alternative to individual claims, and because individual Class members are 
unlikely to bring individual actions given the likelihood that their litigation expenses would exceed any potential 
recovery""). The presence of some larger purchasers in the proposed Class who potentially could support an 
individual suit does not militate against the superiority of the class action, given the presence [*28]  and number of 
5 There is also a fourth consideration: ""(D) the difficulties likely to be encountered in the management of a class action."" Fed. R. 
Civ. P. 23(b)(3)(D). The Court, however, need not consider this final factor in the context of a settlement-only class certification. 
See Amchem, 521 U.S. at 620 (""Confronted with a request for settlement-only class certification, a district court need not inquire 
whether the case, if tried, would present intractable management problems, see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23(b)(3)(D), for the 
proposal is that there be no trial.""). 
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 56744, *23

 
smaller claimants. See Bradburn, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16193, 2004 WL 1842987, at *18 (finding the superiority 
requirement to be satisfied even though the ""class may include members who have purchased a sufficiently large 
quantity of tape from 3M to justify the commencement of an individual suit"" because ""the class also contains many 
members whose potential damage awards would be dwarfed by their potential litigation expenses.""). If these larger 
purchasers preferred to litigate separately, they could have opted out of the proposed Settlement. The fact that, of 
the potential members of the proposed MeijerClass, only Kmart chose to bring an individual action speaks both to 
the lack of interest of the Members of the proposed Class in litigating separately and to the lack of ""litigation 
concerning the controversy already commenced by or against members of the class."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3); see 
also In re Warfarin, 391 F.3d at 534 (""[T]here were a relatively small number of individual lawsuits pending against 
[the defendant] in this matter, which indicated . . . that there was a lack of interest in individual prosecution [*29]  of 
claims.""). Lastly, the consolidation of these claims before the Court is appropriate given the Court's experience and 
familiarity with the previous litigation, LePage's, that arose from the conduct of 3M at issue here. Accordingly, the 
Court finds that a class action is the superior method of adjudication in this case, as required by Rule 23(b)(3).
Thus, the Court concludes that the proposed Settlement Class satisfies all of the relevant requirements of Rule 
23(a) and (b) and, therefore, approves final certification of the Class for the purposes of settlement.
III. MOTION FOR FINAL APPROVAL OF SETTLEMENT
HN9[
] ""The decision of whether to approve a proposed settlement of a class action is left to the sound discretion 
of the district court."" Girsh v. Jepson, 521 F.2d 153, 156 (3d Cir. 1975). ""While the law generally favors settlement 
in complex or class action cases for its conservation of judicial resources, the court has an obligation to ensure that 
any settlement reached protects the interests of the class members."" In re Aetna Inc. Sec. Litig., 2001 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 68, MDL No. 1219, 2001 WL 20928, at *4 (E.D. Pa. Jan. 4, 2001) (citing In re General Motors, 55 F.3d at 
784). [*30]  Consequently, prior to approving a settlement, the Court must determine whether the notice provided to 
class members was adequate. Id. (citations omitted). The Court must also ""scrutinize the terms of the settlement to 
ensure that it is 'fair, adequate and reasonable.'"" Id. (quoting In re General Motors, 55 F.3d at 785). ""[C]ases such 
as this, where the parties simultaneously seek certification and settlement approval, require 'courts to be even more 
scrupulous than usual' when they examine the fairness of the proposed settlement."" In re Prudential, 148 F.3d at 
317 (quoting In re General Motors, 55 F.3d at 805).
A. Adequacy of Notice
HN10[
] The due process demands of the Fifth Amendment and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure require 
adequate notice to class members of a proposed settlement. In re Aetna, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 68, 2001 WL 
20928, at *5. ""In the class action context, the district court obtains personal jurisdiction over the absentee class 
members by providing proper notice of the impending class action and providing the absentees with the opportunity 
to be heard or the opportunity to exclude themselves from the class.  [*31]  "" In re Prudential, 148 F.3d at 306 
(citing Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts, 472 U.S. 797, 811-12, 105 S. Ct. 2965, 86 L. Ed. 2d 628 (1985)). The due 
process requirements of the Fifth Amendment are satisfied by the ""combination of reasonable notice, the 
opportunity to be heard and the opportunity to withdraw from the class."" Id. The notice must be ""'reasonably 
calculated under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them 
an opportunity to present their objections.'"" Lachance v. Harrington, 965 F. Supp. 630, 636 (E.D. Pa.1997) (quoting 
Mullane v. Cent. Hanover Bank & Trust Co., 339 U.S. 306, 314, 70 S. Ct. 652, 94 L. Ed. 865 (1950)).
HN11[
] Moreover, ""in a settlement class maintained under Rule 23(b)(3), class notice must meet the 
requirements of both Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(c)(2) and 23(e)."" In re Diet Drugs (Phentermine, 
Fenfluramine, Dexfenfluramine) Prod. Liab. Litig., 226 F.R.D. 498, 517 (E.D. Pa. 2005) (citing Carlough v. Amchem 
Prods., Inc., 158 F.R.D. 314, 324-25 (E.D. Pa. 1993)). [*32]  Rule 23(c)(2) provides that class members must 
receive the ""best notice practicable under the circumstances, including individual notice to all members who can be 
identified through reasonable effort."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(2)(B). Rule 23(c)(2) also requires that ""the notice indicate 
an opportunity to opt out, that the judgment will bind all class members who do not opt out and that any member 
who does not opt out may appear through counsel."" In re Diet Drugs, 226 F.R.D. at 517 (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 
23(c)(2)).
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 56744, *28

 
HN12[
] In addition to the requirements of Rule 23(c)(2), Rule 23(e) ""requires that notice of a proposed settlement 
must inform class members: (1) of the nature of the pending litigation; (2) of the settlement's general terms; (3) that 
complete information is available from the court files; and (4) that any class member may appear and be heard at 
the Fairness Hearing."" Id. at 517-18 (citation omitted). The court should consider both ""the mode of dissemination 
and its content to assess whether notice was sufficient."" Id. Although the ""notice need not be unduly specific [*33]  . 
. . the notice document must describe, in detail, the nature of the proposed settlement, the circumstances justifying 
it, and the consequences of accepting and opting out of it."" Id. at 518 (citing In re Diet Drugs (Phentermine, 
Fenfluramine, Dexfenfluramine) Prod. Liab. Litig., 369 F.3d 293, 308-10 (3d Cir. 2004)).
The Court finds that the Notice provided in this case satisfies the requirements of due process and the Federal 
Rules of Civil Procedure. Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement and the Court's Preliminary Approval Order, Meijer 
hired CCS as Settlement Administrator to oversee the dissemination of Notice to the Class. (Small Decl. II P 3.) 
Potential Members of the Settlement Class were identified by Meijer and 3M through the examination of 3M's sales 
data as well as the list of entities compiled in the Bradburn litigation. (Small Decl. P 52.) Between May 1 and May 5, 
2006, CCS sent Notice by first-class mail to the 143 entities identified as those believed to be Members of the 
Settlement Class. (Small Decl. P 52; Glenn Aff. P 5.) This Notice was accompanied by a preprinted Proof of Claim 
form, which provided the total invoice amount [*34]  paid to 3M by the Settlement Class Member for invisible 
transparent tape for home or office use, less any applicable volume rebates, from 1999 through 2004. (Small Decl. 
P 53.) An attachment to the preprinted form listed this information on a year-by-year and SKU-by-SKU basis. ( Id.) 
Settlement Class Members were given the opportunity either to agree with the total purchase amount stated on the 
Proof of Claim form, or to disagree and provide supporting documentation for a different amount. (Id.) On or about 
April 27, 2006, CCS sent Summary Notice by first-class mail to over 3000 other entities identified by 3M as having 
purchased invisible or transparent tape directly from 3M, based on the list used in the Bradburn litigation. (Small 
Decl. P 52; Glenn Aff. P 4.) Each entity receiving Summary Notice also received a Claim Form Request, with which 
it could request a Proof of Claim Form if it believed it was a Member of the Settlement Class. (Small Decl. P 54.) 
Additionally, an abbreviated Summary Notice was published on May 11, 2006, in DSN Retailing Today, 
Supermarket News, and Office Products International. (Glenn Aff. P 6.) Lastly, Notice was posted on a 
dedicated [*35]  website, www.TransparentTapeDirectPurchaserSettlement.com; this website has been active since 
May 1, 2006. (Small Decl. P 52; Glenn Aff. P 12.) The Court finds that these efforts to disseminate notice were the 
best practicable. See Zimmer Paper Prods., Inc. v. Berger & Montague, 758 F.2d 86, 90 (3d Cir. 1985)(noting that 
HN13[
] ""in the usual situation first-class mail and publication in press fully satisfy the notice requirements of both 
Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 and the due process clause"").
The Court also finds the content of the Notice and the Summary Notices to be adequate under the due process 
clause and Rules 23. The Notice describes the nature and background of this action and defines the Class, Class 
claims, and consequences of Class Membership. (Glenn Aff. Ex. 2.) It summarizes the terms of the Settlement, 
including information relating to the size of the Settlement Fund; the release provisions of the Settlement; and the 
attorneys' fees, expenses, and incentive award for which Meijer may apply. (Id.) The Notice also describes the 
proposed Distribution Plan and details how to submit a proper and timely Proof of Claim form, advising [*36]  Class 
Members that, if they fail to submit a proper Proof of Claim form by the specified deadline, they may be barred from 
any recovery though still bound by the final disposition of the litigation. (Id. at 3-4.) The Notice alerts Class Members 
to their right to request exclusion from the Class, and details the procedure for and consequences of doing so. (Id. 
at 3.) The Notice informs Class Members of the time and date of the Final Approval Hearing, advising them of the 
nature and purpose of the Hearing, of their rights to object to the Settlement and appear at the Hearing, and of the 
procedure for asserting those rights. (Id. at 4.) The Notice includes the contact information of the relevant attorneys 
and of the Settlement Administrator, and also directs Class Members to the dedicated website, where copies of the 
Notice, the Settlement Agreement, and other documents pertaining to the case may be found. (Id.) The Summary 
Notices provide the essential information regarding the Class, the litigation, the terms of the Settlement, and the 
Final Approval Hearing. (Glenn Aff. Exs. 1,4.) The Summary Notices inform potential Class Members of their rights 
with regard to the [*37]  Settlement and provide information on how copies of the full Notice and Settlement 
Agreement may be obtained. (Id.) The Summary Notice distributed by mail also explicitly distinguishes the 
proposed Meijer Class from the Bradburn Class and details both the procedure for submitting the Claim Form 
Request and the consequences of failing to submit a Proof of Claim form. (Glenn Aff. Ex.1.) After reviewing the 
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 56744, *32

 
Notice and Summary Notices, the Court concludes that their substance, like the method of their dissemination, is 
sufficient to satisfy the concerns of due process and Rule 23. See In re Prudential, 148 F.3d at 328; In re Aetna, 
2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 68, 2001 WL 20928, at *5 (citing In re Ikon Office Solutions, Inc. Sec. Litig., 194 F.R.D. 166, 
175 (E.D. Pa. 2000)).
B. Presumption of Fairness
HN14[
] Rule 23(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires that the Court must approve any settlement of 
a class action and states that the Court may only approve a settlement ""after a hearing and on finding that the 
settlement, voluntary dismissal, or compromise is fair, reasonable, and adequate."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(1) [*38]  . 
The Third Circuit has determined that a court should accord a presumption of fairness to settlements if the court 
finds that: ""(1) the negotiations occurred at arms length; (2) there was sufficient discovery; (3) the proponents of the 
settlement are experienced in similar litigation; and (4) only a small fraction of the class objected."" In re Cendant 
Corp. Litig., 264 F.3d 201, 232 n.18 (3d Cir. 2001) (citing In re General Motors, 55 F.3d at 785).
The Settlement in this case is entitled to a presumption of fairness. The Settlement Agreement resulted from arm's-
length negotiations that occurred both during the Court-suggested mediation and in the months following. (Small 
Decl. PP 36, 40.) Prior to the mediation, the parties exchanged detailed mediation statements so that discussions 
could be founded on the attorneys' full understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of their cases. (Id. PP 34-
35.) The Settlement was reached after a year of litigation and discovery, during which the parties also had access 
to the LePage's trial record and the Court's ruling on collateral estoppel in Bradburn.  See Bradburn Parent/Teacher 
Store, Inc. v. 3M, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11375, Civ A. No. 02-7676,2005 WL 1388929 [*39]  (E.D. Pa. June 9, 
2005). 6 (Id. PP 18, 26.) Meijer engaged in coordinated discovery with the parties in the Bradburn, Publix, and 
Kmart actions, which entailed the compilation and review of hundreds of thousands of pages of documents and 
participation in multiple depositions. (Id. PP 18-25, 28.) As already discussed, Class Counsel has extensive 
experience litigating antitrust class actions such as the one at hand. Lastly, no Class Members filed objections to 
the Settlement. Accordingly, the Court will apply a presumption of fairness in analyzing the Settlement. 
 [*40]  C. The Girsh Factors
HN15[
] The Third Circuit developed a nine-factor test in Girsh, ""which provides the analytic structure for 
determining whether a class action settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate under Rule 23(e)."" In re Cendant, 
264 F.3d at 231 (citation omitted). The nine factors are: 
(1) The complexity, expense, and likely duration of the litigation; (2) the reaction of the class to the settlement; 
(3) the stage of the proceedings and the amount of discovery completed; (4) the risks of establishing liability; 
(5) the risks of establishing damages; (6) the risks of maintaining the class action through the trial; (7) the 
ability of the defendants to withstand a greater judgment; (8) the range of reasonableness of the settlement 
6 Based on the outcome of the LePage's litigation, the Court held that collateral estoppel applied to establish the following facts 
upon the trial of the Bradburn action: 
1. For the time period from June 11, 1993 [to] October 13, 1999, the relevant market in this matter is the market for invisible 
and transparent tape for home and office use in the United States;
2. For some period of time between June 11, 1993 and October 13, 1999, 3M possessed monopoly power in the relevant 
market, including the power to control prices and exclude competition in the relevant market;
3. For some period of time between June 11, 1993 and October 13, 1999, 3M willfully maintained such monopoly power by 
predatory or exclusionary conduct; and
4. For some period of time between June 11, 1993 and October 13, 1999, 3M's predatory or exclusionary conduct harmed 
competition.
Bradburn, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11375, 2005 WL 1388929, at *7. 
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 56744, *37

 
fund in light of the best possible recovery; and (9) the range of reasonableness of the settlement fund in light of 
all the attendant risks of litigation.
Id. at 232 (citing Girsh, 521 F.2d at 157). Upon consideration of these factors, the Court finds that the proposed 
Settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate. 7 
 [*41]  
1. Complexity, expense, and likely duration of the litigation
HN16[
] ""This factor captures 'the probable costs, in both time and money, of continued litigation.'"" Id. at 323 
(citing In re General Motors, 55 F.3d at 812). An antitrust class action, such as this one, is ""arguably the most 
complex action to prosecute"" as ""[t]he legal and factual issues involved are always numerous and uncertain in 
outcome."" In re Linerboard Antitrust Litig., 296 F. Supp. 2d 568, 577 (E.D. Pa. 2003) (citations and internal 
quotation marks omitted).
In the absence of settlement, significant costs in terms of both time and money likely would result from the 
continued litigation of this case. At the time when the MOU and the subsequent Settlement Agreement were 
reached, the issue of class certification was still pending, and other legal issues, including the potential tolling of the 
statute of limitations and the proper preclusive effect of the LePage's verdict, were going to be disputed. The parties 
had begun coordinated discovery at that point, but substantial merits discovery remained. In addition to discovery 
costs, continued litigation potentially [*42]  would have entailed various dispositive motions, the procurement and 
submission of additional expert reports, and a substantial trial. Whatever the disposition of the case, litigation likely 
would have continued for some time thereafter through post-trial motions and appeal. See In re Ikon, 194 F.R.D. at 
179 (""[T]he extremely large sums of money at issue almost guarantee that any outcome, whether by summary 
judgment or trial, would be appealed.""). The time and resources saved by the avoidance of these costs would 
benefit all parties. See In re Warfarin, 391 F.3d at 536 (""[I]t was inevitable that post-trial motions and appeals would 
not only further prolong the litigation but also reduce the value of recovery to the class.""); In re Aetna, 2001 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 68, 2001 WL 20928,at *6 (noting that ""[t]he risk of delay could have deleterious effects on any future 
recovery due to the time value of money""). Thus the Court finds that the complexity, expense, and likely duration of 
the litigation favor settlement. See In re Prudential, 148 F.3d at 318 (""[T]he trial of this class action would be a long, 
arduous process requiring great expenditures [*43]  of time and money on behalf of both the parties and the court. 
The prospect of such a massive undertaking clearly counsels in favor of settlement.""). 
2. The reaction of the class
HN17[
] This factor ""attempts to gauge whether members of the class support the settlement."" Id. As stated 
above, Notice of this Settlement was disseminated thoroughly by means of publication and first-class mail, and 
informed potential Class Members of their rights to object to the Settlement and to request exclusion from the 
Class. The deadline for filing objections and requesting exclusion was June 6, 2006. As of the Final Approval 
Hearing on August 8, 2006, no objections and only one request for exclusion had been filed. (Glenn Aff. P 15.) This 
total absence of objections, coupled with such a low opt-out rate, argues in favor of the proposed Settlement. See, 
e.g., In re PNC Fin. Servs. Group, Inc., 440 F. Supp. 2d 421, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 47618, Civ. A. No. 02-271, 
2006 WL 1984660, at *9 (W.D. Pa. July 13, 2006)(""Here, no class member objected to the proposed settlement. 
Similarly, only five opt outs were received after the mailing of over 73,000 copies of the notice and the publication of 
the summary notice. Under [*44]  these circumstances an inference of strong class support is properly drawn.""); 
7 As the Third Circuit has recently noted, ""The Girsh factors do not provide an exhaustive list of factors to be considered when 
reviewing a proposed settlement."" In re AT&T Corp. Sec. Litig.,455 F.3d 160, 2006 WL 2021033, at *3 (3d Cir. 2006). In In re 
Prudential, for instance, the Third Circuit enumerated a list of additional considerations which may be relevant to a court's 
assessment of the fairness of a class action settlement. 148 F.3d at 323. After thorough review of the proposed Settlement in 
this case, the Court has found that all considerations relevant to its assessment of the Settlement's fairness are fully covered by 
the Court's analysis of the adequacy of the Notice, the nine Girsh factors, and the fairness of the Distribution Plan. 
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 56744, *40

 
Marino v. UDR, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 39680, Civ. A. No. 05-2268, 2006 WL 1687026, at *3 (E.D. Pa. June 14, 
2006) (""The fact that there are no opt-outs and no objections favors the proposed settlement."") (citing Stoetzner v. 
U.S. Steel Corp., 897 F.2d 115, 118-119 (3d Cir. 1990)); Perry v. Fleet Boston Fin. Corp., 229 F.R.D. 105, 115 
(E.D. Pa. 2005) (holding that, when only 70 out of 90,000 potential class members opted out and ""not a single class 
member objected to the proposed settlement . . . [s]uch a response (or lack thereof) weighs greatly in favor of 
approving the settlement"") (citing cases). The lack of objections and low opt-out rate are particularly notable in this 
case as ""these are sophisticated businesses with, in some cases, large potential claims, and they could be 
expected to object to a settlement they perceived as unfair or inadequate."" In re Warfarin Sodium Antitrust Litig., 
212 F.R.D. 231, 254-55 (D. Del. 2002), aff'd, 391 F.3d 516 (3d Cir. 2004).
Additionally, as of August 1, 2006, approximately sixty-eight Settlement Class Members [*45]  had submitted Proof 
of Claim forms qualifying them to participate in the proposed Settlement. (Glenn Aff. P 13). These claimants amount 
to nearly half of the 143 entities to whom Notice originally was mailed and over 60% of the tape purchases by 
Settlement Class Members from 3M during the relevant period. (Id.) This response further indicates the fairness of 
the proposed Settlement. See In re Auto. Refinishing Paint Antitrust Litig., MDL No. 1426, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
29161, at *15 (E.D. Pa. Sept. 27, 2004) (""The fact that there have been no objectors to the Settlement, that the 
claims filed represent a significant majority of the sales at issue, and that claims have been filed by major 
companies with significant resources . . . supports approval of the settlement.""); Stoner v. CBA Info. Servs., 352 F. 
Supp. 2d 549, 552 (E.D. Pa. 2005) (""Over 16% of 11,980 class members notified have submitted claim forms 
seeking to participate in the settlement. Only 18 members have chosen to opt out and only five have filed . . . 
objections to the proposed settlement. This relatively high response rate indicates a more than favorable class 
reaction."") (footnote [*46]  and citations omitted). Accordingly, the Court finds that the reaction of the Class in this 
case strongly favors approval of the Settlement. 
3. Stage of proceedings and amount of discovery completed
HN18[
] This factor enables the Court to ""'determine whether counsel had an adequate appreciation of the merits 
of the case before negotiating.'"" In re Cendant, 264 F.3d at 235 (quoting In re General Motors, 55 F.3d at 813). In 
this case, a substantial amount of discovery had been performed before the Settlement was reached: Class 
Counsel had compiled and undertaken review of hundreds of thousands of pages of discovery documents and 
depositions, had reviewed the discovery and trial record from the LePage's litigation, had participated in 
coordinated discovery in the Bradburn litigation, and had consulted extensively with an economic expert. Moreover, 
prior to reaching the Settlement, the parties had engaged in mediation, including the exchange of mediation 
statements regarding the merits of their respective positions in order to inform and facilitate their negotiations. The 
Court concludes, therefore, that the parties had ""an adequate appreciation [*47]  of the merits"" of this case at the 
time they negotiated the Settlement. In re Cendant, 264 F.3d at 235 (citation omitted). 
4. Risks of establishing liability
HN19[
] This factor enables the Court to examine ""'what the potential rewards (or downside) of litigation might 
have been had class counsel decided to litigate the claims rather than settle them.'"" In re Cendant, 264 F.3d at 237 
(quoting In re General Motors,55 F.3d at 814). ""When considering this factor, the court should avoid conducting a 
mini-trial. Rather the court may 'give credence to the estimation of the probability of success proffered by class 
counsel, who are experienced with the underlying case, and the possible defenses which may be raised to their 
causes of action.'"" In re Aetna, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 68, 2001 WL 20928, at *9 (quoting In re Ikon, 194 F.R.D. at 
181).
HN20[
] In order to succeed on its claim that 3M violated § 2 of the Sherman Act, Meijer ""must establish that [3M] 
possessed monopoly power in the [relevant] market and that it willfully acquired or maintained that power as 
distinguished from achieving growth or development as a consequence [*48]  of a superior product, business 
acumen, or historic accident."" In re Warfarin, 391 F.3d at 529 n.11 (citing United States v. Grinnell Corp., 384 U.S. 
563, 570-71, 86 S. Ct. 1698, 16 L. Ed. 2d 778 (1966)). Meijer's risks of establishing liability in this case are 
diminished by the LePage's verdict and the collateral estoppel ruling in Bradburn. Meijer, however, faced numerous 
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 56744, *44

 
challenges in establishing 3M's liability in this case. For instance, the rebates offered by 3M after 1999 8 may not 
have been anti-competitive and the verdict in favor of LePage's does not mean that purchasers of tape from 3M 
were necessarily injured as well, since many of them may have benefitted from the challenged rebates. The Court 
concludes that, given these challenges, this factor favors settlement. 
5. Risks of establishing damages
HN21[
] ""Like [*49]  the fourth factor, 'this inquiry attempts to measure the expected value of litigating the action 
rather than settling it at the current time.'"" In re Cendant, 264 F.3d at 238-39 (quoting In re General Motors, 55 F.3d 
at 816). In making this inquiry, the Court considers the ""potential damage award if the case were taken to trial 
against the benefits of immediate settlement."" In re Warfarin, 212 F.R.D. at 256 (citingIn re Prudential, 148 F.3d at 
319). Meijer had not completed a final damages calculation prior to reaching the Settlement Agreement with 3M 
against which the Settlement Amount may be compared. The Settlement Class, however, would face significant 
risks in establishing damages at trial. For instance, to the extent that some Class Members may have benefitted 
from the challenged rebates, they would have had to prove that a period of recoupment followed the discontinuation 
of the rebates. See generally Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 588-89, 106 S. Ct. 
1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). Some evidence, however, suggests that such a recoupment period never occurred 
and that, even if [*50]  such recoupment were established, the resulting damages period potentially would have 
been fairly short. (Leffler Decl. II PP 4, 8-13.) Additionally, the parties' efforts to dispute damages at trial 
undoubtedly would result in a ""'battle of the experts,' with each side presenting its figures to the jury and with no 
guarantee whom the jury would believe."" In re Cendant, 264 F.3d at 239. For these reasons, the Court concludes 
that the risks of establishing damages weigh in favor of settlement in this case. 
6. Risks of maintaining class action status through trial
HN22[
] This factor allows the Court to weigh the possibility that, if a class were certified for trial in this case, it 
would be decertified prior to trial. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a) provides that ""a district court may decertify 
or modify a class at any time during the litigation if it proves to be unmanageable, and proceeding to trial would 
always entail the risk, even if slight, of decertification."" In re Cendant, 264 F.3d at 239 (citation and internal 
quotations omitted). The Settlement here was reached before the Court had ruled [*51]  on class certification, a 
motion which 3M had contested. Thus, there was the risk that such certification would not be granted in the first 
place, along with the ever-present risk that the class, if certified, would have been decertified later in the litigation. 
Accordingly, the Court finds that this factor favors settlement. See In re Prudential, 148 F.3d at 321 (""There will 
always be a 'risk' or possibility of decertification, and consequently the court can always claim this factor weighs in 
favor of settlement."") 
7. Ability of defendants to withstand greater judgment
HN23[
] This factor ""is concerned with whether the defendants could withstand a judgment for an amount 
significantly greater than the Settlement."" In re Cendant, 264 F.3d at 240. The Court notes that 3M, with 2005 
annual net sales of $ 21.2 billion (3M 2005 Annual Report), likely can withstand a judgment significantly greater 
than the Settlement Amount. Even so, this determination in itself does not carry much weight in evaluating the 
fairness of the Settlement. See Perry, 229 F.R.D. at 116 (""Fleet could certainly withstand a much larger judgment 
as it has [*52]  considerable assets. While that fact weighs against approving the settlement, this factor's 
importance is lessened by the obstacles the class would face in establishing liability and damages.""). Accordingly, 
the Court finds that this factor disfavors settlement, albeit very slightly. 
8 & 9. Range of reasonableness (in light of best possible recovery and risks of litigation)
8 The collateral estoppel ruling in Bradburn only covers the Class Period up until October 13, 1999. Bradburn, 2005 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 11375, 2005 WL 1388929, at *7. 
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 56744, *48

 
HN24[
] The eight and ninth Girsh factors ""ask whether the settlement is reasonable in light of the best possible 
recovery and the risks the parties would face if the case went to trial."" In re Aetna, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 68, 2001 
WL 20928, at *11 (citing In re Prudential, 148 F.3d at 322). In making this assessment, the Court compares ""'the 
present value of the damages plaintiffs would likely recover if successful, appropriately discounted for the risk of not 
prevailing'"" with ""'the amount of the proposed settlement.'"" In re General Motors, 55 F.3d at 806 (quoting MCL 2d § 
30.44). The damages estimates should ""generate a range of reasonableness (based on size of the proposed award 
and the uncertainty inherent in these estimates) within which a district court approving (or [*53]  rejecting) a 
settlement will not be set aside."" Id. (citation omitted). ""The primary touchstone of this inquiry is the economic 
valuation of the proposed settlement."" Id. ""In making this assessment, the evaluating court must recognize that 
""settlement represents a compromise in which the highest hopes for recovery are yielded in exchange for certainty 
and resolution and guard against demanding too large a settlement based on the court's own view of the merits of 
the litigation."" In re Aetna, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 68, 2001 WL 20928, at *11 (citing In re General Motors, 55 F.3d at 
806).
Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, Settlement Class Members will receive immediate monetary relief in 
accordance with their relevant purchases of 3M tape, without undertaking the risks, costs, and delays of further 
litigation. The Settlement Fund equals approximately 2% of the amount paid to 3M by Members of the Settlement 
Class for invisible and transparent tape for home or office use during the period from October 2, 1998 to February 
10, 2006. Kmart - the one potential member of the proposed Meijer Class that brought an individual suit against 3M 
- and Publix both settled their [*54]  claims against 3M for that percentage of their relevant purchases. This 
percentage also falls ""within a range of settlements reached in other antitrust class actions"" in this District. In re 
Auto. Refinishing Paint Antitrust Litig., 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29161, MDL No. 1426, 2004 WL 1068807, at *2 
(preliminarily approving a settlement which represented approximately 2% of sales during the class period); see 
also In re Linerboard Antitrust Litig., 321 F. Supp. 2d 619, 627 (E.D. Pa. 2004) (approving a settlement that 
represents 1.62% of sales from class period); In re Plastic Tableware Antitrust Litig., 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17014, 
Civ. A. No. 94-3564, 1995 WL 678663, at *1 (E.D. Pa. Nov. 13, 1995) (3.5% of sales); Fisher Bros. v. Mueller Brass 
Co., 630 F. Supp. 493, 499 (E.D. Pa. 1985) (0.2% of sales); Axelrod v. Saks & Co., 77 F.R.D. 441, 1981 WL 2031, 
at *1 (E.D. Pa. Feb. 23, 1981) (3.7% of sales)). Moreover, there is no indication that this Settlement Amount has 
been reached inappropriately, or should otherwise be considered suspect; both parties have demonstrated 
willingness and ability to litigate this action, have engaged in mediation [*55]  at the Court's suggestion, and have 
reached an agreement that provides Class Members with monetary relief that is immediate, significant, and in line 
with other comparable settlements. See In re Aetna, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 68, 2001 WL 20928, at *11 
(""Additionally, the hallmarks of a questionable settlement are absent. Plaintiffs will receive a significant monetary 
settlement, and there is no suggestion of collusion between Defendants and Plaintiffs' counsel."") (internal quotation 
marks omitted). Accordingly, the Court finds that the Settlement represents a reasonable compromise in light of 
both the best possible recovery and the risks of litigation.
Thus, of the nine Girsh factors, the Court finds that only one - Defendant's ability to withstand greater judgment - 
does not favor the proposed Settlement. This one factor is outweighed by the other Girsh factors favoring the 
Settlement. The Court, therefore, concludes that the Settlement Agreement is fair, adequate, and reasonable.
D. Fairness of the Distribution Plan
HN25[
] In addition to analyzing the terms of the Settlement Agreement, the Court must also examine the fairness 
of the proposed Distribution Plan. ""'Approval of a plan of [*56]  allocation of a settlement fund in a class action is 
governed by the same standards of review applicable to approval of the settlement as a whole: the distribution plan 
must be fair, reasonable and adequate.'"" In re Ikon, 194 F.R.D. at 184 (quoting In re Computron Software Inc., 6 F. 
Supp. 2d 313, 321 (D.N.J. 1998)). ""Courts generally consider plans of allocation that reimburse class members 
based on the type and extent of their injuries to be reasonable."" In re Aetna, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 68, 2001 WL 
20928, at *12 (citing In re Ikon, 194 F.R.D. at 184).
The proposed Distribution Plan allocates the Settlement Fund among Class Members who submit proof of their 
claims in proportion to each claimant's relevant, direct purchases from 3M. As detailed above, each Class Member 
may submit a preprinted Proof of Claim form which specifies that particular Member's purchase amount. When 
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 56744, *52

 
submitting this form, the Class Member can either agree with the total purchase amount stated in the form or 
disagree and provide supporting documentation for a different amount. These Proof of Claim forms must have been 
postmarked by July 11, 2006, for those Class Members [*57]  who received them initially by mail, and by August 7, 
2006, for those who received their forms in response to a Claim Form Request. Once the Settlement Administrator 
has received and reviewed all of the forms and has calculated each Class Member's recovery, Plaintiffs will return 
to the Court to seek approval for the distribution of the Settlement Fund. The Court finds that the amount of a Class 
Member's relevant, direct purchases provides a reasonable measure of the relative injury which each Class 
Member has suffered, and that the submission procedure for the Proof of Claim forms affords each Class Member 
an opportunity to attest to the extent of its own injury and, in turn, deserved allocation. Thus, the Distribution Plan 
correlates to the damages that each participating Class Member actually suffered, and the Court finds this Plan to 
be fair, reasonable and adequate.
In sum, the Court finds that the content and dissemination of Notice in this case satisfies the requirements of due 
process and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and also finds that the Settlement Agreement is fair, adequate 
and reasonable in light of all relevant considerations. The Court therefore grants final [*58]  approval to the 
Settlement. The Court further finds that the proposed Distribution Plan is fair, reasonable and adequate, and 
approves the Plan.
IV. MOTION FOR ATTORNEYS' FEES, EXPENSES, AND INCENTIVE AWARD
Plaintiffs' Counsel have asked the Court to award attorneys' fees amounting to the smaller of $ 7.5 million or one-
third of the amount remaining in the Settlement Fund after refunding any reversion to 3M. As mentioned above, one 
Settlement Class Member, Costco, has requested exclusion. After appropriate reversion to 3M, the Settlement 
Amount totals $ 27,783,836.97. As $ 7.5 million is less than one-third of the Settlement Amount after reversion, 
Plaintiffs' Counsel seeks $ 7.5 million in attorneys' fees. Plaintiffs' Counsel has also requested reimbursement of 
litigation expenses in the amount of $ 390,452.46. Meijer has requested an incentive award of $ 25,000 as 
compensation for the services it provided as Class Representative. All three requests are to be paid from the 
Settlement Fund prior to the distribution of the Fund to eligible Members of the Settlement Class.
A. Expenses
HN26[
] ""Attorneys who create a common fund for the benefit of a class are entitled to reimbursement [*59]  of 
reasonable litigation expenses from the fund."" In re Aetna, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 68, 2001 WL 20928, at *13 (citing 
In re Ikon, 194 F.R.D. at 192). Plaintiffs' Counsel have requested reimbursement of litigation expenses incurred 
from the beginning of this litigation through August 1, 2006, totaling $ 390,452.46. (Small Decl. PP 70-75; Small 
Decl. II PP 14-20.) These expenses were incurred in connection with the prosecution and settlement of the 
litigation, and include costs related to the following: travel; computerized legal research; copying; postage; 
telephone and fax; transcripts; retention of a mediator; the document database; expert services; and claims 
administration. 9 (Id.) The Court notes that the total amount of these expenses is below the maximum amount of $ 
450,000 provided for in the Notice that was mailed to the Settlement Class, and that no objections have been filed 
in response to this request for reimbursement. Accordingly, the Court finds that the litigation expenses enumerated 
by Plaintiffs' Counsel are reasonable and grants Plaintiffs' Counsel's request for reimbursement. 10 See, e.g.,In re 
Remeron End-Payor Antitrust Litig., Civ. A. No. 02-2007, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27011,  [*60]  at *92 (D.N.J. Sept. 
13, 2005) (approving reimbursement of expenses which ""reflect costs expended for purposes of prosecuting this 
litigation, including substantial fees for experts; substantial costs associated with creating and maintaining an 
9 Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement and the Court's Preliminary Approval Order, the Settlement Administrator was paid $ 
25,000 from the Settlement Fund on April 28, 2006 in partial payment of the costs of giving Notice to the Settlement Class; this 
amount is not included in Plaintiffs' Counsel's request for reimbursement. (Small Decl. P 74.) 
10 The Court notes that Plaintiffs' Counsel expects to incur approximately $ 20,000 in additional claims administration costs prior 
to the distribution of the Settlement Fund. (Small Decl. II P 21.) These future expenses are not included in the present request, 
but Plaintiffs' Counsel will seek reimbursement for them in Plaintiffs' Counsel's anticipated motion with respect to distribution of 
the Settlement Fund.

electronic document database; travel and lodging expenses; copying costs; and the costs of deposition 
transcripts""). 
 [*61]  B. Attorneys' Fees
HN27[
] ""District courts approving class action settlements must thoroughly review fee petitions for fairness. 
Although the ultimate decision as to the proper amount of attorneys' fees rests in the sound discretion of the court, 
the court must set forth its reasoning clearly."" In re Aetna, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 68, 2001 WL 20928, at *13 
(citations omitted). Thorough review of fee arrangements is critical in the context of a class action settlement 
because of ""'the danger . . . that the lawyers might urge a class settlement at a low figure or on a less-than optimal 
basis in exchange for red-carpet treatment for fees,'"" In re General Motors, 55 F.3d at 820 (quoting Weinberger v. 
Great N. Nekoosa Corp., 925 F.2d 518, 524 (1st Cir. 1991)), and because the parties to the action might lack 
sufficient incentive to object to the arrangement. In re AT&T Corp. Sec. Litig., 455 F.3d 160, 2006 WL 2021033, at 
*6 (3d Cir. 2006). ""[C]ourts must be especially vigilant in searching for the possibility of collusion in pre-certification 
settlements"" such as the one at hand. In re General Motors, 55 F.3d at 820. [*62]  
HN28[
] Courts typically use one of two methods for assessing attorneys' fees, either the percentage of recovery 
method or the lodestar method. In re Rite Aid Corp. Sec. Litig., 396 F.3d 294, 300 (3d Cir. 2005). The Court will 
utilize the percentage of recovery method in this case as it is ""generally favored in common fund cases because it 
allows courts to award fees from the fund 'in a manner that rewards counsel for success and penalizes it for 
failure.'"" Id. (quoting In re Prudential, 148 F.3d at 333). The Court, however, will use the lodestar method "" to 'cross-
check' the percentage fee award,"" as the Third Circuit recommends, in order to verify that the fee award is not 
excessive. Id. at 305 (citing In re Prudential, 148 F.3d at 333).
HN29[
] When a district court uses the percentage of recovery method, it ""first calculates the percentage of the 
total recovery that the proposal would allocate to attorneys fees by dividing the amount of the requested fee by the 
total amount paid out by the defendant; it then inquires whether that percentage is appropriate based on the 
circumstances of the case."" In re Cendant, 264 F.3d at 256. [*63]  ""The percentage will be based on the net 
settlement fund after deducting the costs of litigation."" In re Aetna, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 68, 2001 WL 20928, at 
*14 (citingIn re Ikon, 194 F.R.D. at 193). The net Settlement Fund in this case, as of August 1, 2006, is $ 
27,393,384.51. Consequently, the requested fee of $ 7.5 million would result in a percentage of recovery of 27.4%.
HN30[
] In Gunter v. Ridgewood Energy Corp.,223 F.3d 190 (3d Cir. 2000), the Third Circuit directed the district 
courts to consider the following seven factors when determining whether a percentage of recovery fee award is 
reasonable: 
(1) the size of the fund created and the number of persons benefitted;
(2) the presence or absence of substantial objections by members of the class to the settlement terms and/or 
the fees requested by counsel;
(3) the skill and efficiency of the attorneys involved; (4) the complexity and duration of the litigation; (5) the risk 
of nonpayment;
(6) the amount of time devoted to the case by plaintiffs' counsel; and
(7) the awards in similar cases.
Id. at 195 n.1; see also In re Rite Aid, 396 F.3d at 301. [*64]  ""Since this is a flexible and fact-driven determination,"" 
In re Aetna, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 68, 2001 WL 20928, at *14, district courts are not limited to the Gunter factors in 
their analysis of the fee request's reasonableness. As the Third Circuit recently noted: 
HN31[
] This list [of Gunter factors] was not intended to be exhaustive. . . . In Prudential, we noted three other 
factors that may be relevant and important to consider: (1) the value of benefits accruing to class members 
attributable to the efforts of class counsel as opposed to the efforts of other groups, such as government 
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 56744, *60

 
agencies conducting investigations; (2) the percentage fee that would have been negotiated had the case been 
subject to a private contingent fee agreement at the time counsel was retained; and (3) any 'innovative' terms 
of the settlement. . . . In reviewing an attorneys' fees award in a class action settlement, a district court should 
consider the Gunter factors, the Prudential factors, and any other factors that are useful and relevant with 
respect to the particular facts of the case.
In re AT&T, 455 F.3d 160, 2006 WL 2021033, at *4 (citing In re Prudential, 148 F.3d at 338-340). [*65]  While the 
district courts should ""engage in robust assessments of the fee award reasonableness factors when evaluating a 
fee request,"" In re Rite Aid, 396 F.3d at 302, these factors ""'need not be applied in a formulaic way' because each 
case is different, 'and in certain cases, one factor may outweigh the rest.'"" In re AT&T, 455 F.3d 160, 2006 WL 
2021033, at *4 (quotingIn re Rite Aid, 396 F.3d at 301); see also In re Cendant Corp. PRIDES Litig., 243 F.3d 722, 
736 (3d Cir. 2001) (""[A] district court may not rely on a formulaic application of the appropriate range in awarding 
fees but must consider the relevant circumstances of the particular case."").
Having thoroughly reviewed the facts of this case in light of the Gunter and Prudential factors 11 and having applied 
the lodestar cross-check to this analysis, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs' Counsel's request for $ 7.5 million in 
attorneys' fees is reasonable. 
 [*66]  
1. Size of fund created and number of persons benefitted
Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, the Settlement Class will obtain an immediate cash benefit of $ 
27,783,836.97, less attorneys' fees, expenses, and incentive award payments as awarded by the Court. As of 
August 1, 2006, approximately sixty-eight Class Members had filed Proof of Claim forms and so were in a position 
to recover from the Settlement Fund, without having to go through the time, expense, and risk of continued 
litigation. (Glenn Aff. P 13.) While the number of claimants which stand to be benefitted in this Settlement is fairly 
small, these claimants comprise nearly half of the 143 Settlement Class Members to whom individual Notice was 
originally mailed and they account for over 60% of the tape purchases by those Class Members from 3M during the 
relevant period. (Id.) As discussed above, the Settlement Fund was calculated to provide Class Members with a 
recovery amounting to approximately 2% of what they paid to 3M for invisible and transparent tape for home or 
office use during the period from October 2, 1998 to February 10, 2006, a recovery that compares favorably with 
other class action antitrust [*67]  settlements. Thus, although the number of entities positioned to recover a share of 
the Settlement Fund is fairly small, both the percentage of relevant purchases which those entities represent as well 
as the substantial and comparatively favorable size of the Fund obtained by Plaintiffs' Counsel weigh in favor of the 
requested fees. 
2. Presence or absence of substantial objections by members of the class
There have been no objections either to the Settlement Agreement or to the requested attorneys' fees. As detailed 
above, Notice and Summary Notices were disseminated by mail and publication to potential Class Members. The 
Notice clearly disclosed Plaintiffs' Counsel's intention to request the lesser of $ 7.5 million or one-third of the 
Settlement Fund in fees to be paid from the Settlement Fund, and also detailed the procedure by which any Class 
Member could object to that request. The absence of objections to the requested attorneys' fees in this case is 
particularly notable given the sophisticated nature of the absent Class Members. See In re Remeron Direct 
Purchaser Antitrust Litig., Civ. A. No. 03-0085, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27013, at *35 n.1 [*68]  (D.N.J. Nov. 9, 2005) 
(HN32[
] ""When a class is comprised of sophisticated business entities that can be expected to oppose any 
request for attorney fees they find unreasonable, the lack of objections 'indicates the appropriateness of the [fee] 
request.'"" (alteration in original) (quoting Cimarron Pipeline Constr., Inc. v. Nat'l Council on Comp. Ins., 1993 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 19969, Civ. A. Nos. 89-822, 89-1186, 1993 WL 355466, at *1-2 (W.D. Ok. June 8, 1993))); Stop & Shop 
11 The Court has determined that, in this case, all considerations relevant to its analysis of the fee award's reasonableness are 
covered fully by the Gunter and Prudential factors listed above. 
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 56744, *64

 
Supermarket Co. v. SmithKline Beecham Corp., 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9705, Civ. A. No. 03-4578, 2005 WL 
1213926, at *10 (E.D. Pa. May 19, 2005)(finding that this factor weighs in favor of approval because, ""[a]lthough the 
Settlement Class in this case is relatively small and consists of sophisticated businesses, not one member of the 
Settlement Class objected to the requested fee""). The Court finds that this total absence of objections to the 
requested fees weighs in favor of approval. 12 See In re Linerboard Antitrust Litig., 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10532, 
MDL No. 1261, 2004 WL 1221350, at *5 (E.D. Pa. June 2, 2004) (""The absence of objections supports approval of 
the Fee Petition.""); In re Rent-Way Secs. Litig., 305 F. Supp. 2d 491, 515 (W.D. Pa. 2003) [*69]  (""[T]he absence of 
substantial objections by other class members to the fee application supports the reasonableness of Lead 
Counsels' request.""); In re Aetna, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 68, 2001 WL 20928, at *15 (""[T]he Class members' view of 
the attorneys' performance, inferred from the lack of objections to the fee petition, supports the fee award.""). 
3. Skill and efficiency of the attorneys involved
HN33[
] The skill and efficiency of Plaintiffs' Counsel is ""measured by the quality of the result achieved, the 
difficulties faced, the speed and efficiency of the recovery, the standing, experience and expertise of the counsel, 
the skill and professionalism with which counsel prosecuted [*70]  the case and the performance and quality of 
opposing counsel."" In re Ikon, 194 F.R.D. at 194 (citation omitted). As discussed above, Plaintiffs' Counsel are 
highly experienced in complex antitrust class action litigation (Small Decl. PP 62-64, Exs. 8-10) and have obtained 
a significant settlement for the Class despite the complexity and challenges of this case. Defense Counsel are also 
very experienced in complex class action antitrust litigation and have defended this suit skillfully. Accordingly, the 
Court finds that this factor favors approval of the requested fees. 
4. Complexity and duration of the litigation
As discussed above, Plaintiffs' Counsel had been litigating this action for roughly one year when the Settlement 
Agreement was reached. While a duration of one year is not especially long, during that time Plaintiffs' Counsel 
engaged in extensive coordinated discovery, participated in multiple depositions as well as expert consultations, 
briefed and argued 3M's Motion to Dismiss, briefed Meijer's Motion for class certification, prepared for and 
participated in the mediation, and negotiated the terms of the Settlement Agreement. Antitrust class [*71]  actions 
such as this one are ""arguably the most complex action[s] to prosecute."" In re Linerboard, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
10532, 2004 WL 1221350, at *10 (quotation omitted). While the LePage's decision and the collateral estoppel ruling 
in Bradburn favored the Plaintiffs in this action, Plaintiffs' Counsel nonetheless faced complex challenges in 
establishing liability and damages in this case, as discussed above. Accordingly, the Court finds that this factor 
weighs in favor of the reasonableness of the requested fees. 
5. Risk of nonpayment
Plaintiffs' Counsel's compensation for their services in this case was wholly contingent on the success of the 
litigation. (Small Decl. P 61.) Given the risks of establishing liability and damages discussed above, as well as the 
possibility that this case could not be maintained as a class action through trial, the possibility of non-payment has 
been present throughout this litigation. Accordingly, the Court finds that this factor weighs in favor of the requested 
fees. 
6. Amount of time devoted to the case by Plaintiffs' counsel
Plaintiffs' Counsel devoted slightly over 4,500 hours of work on this litigation from the [*72]  inception of the claims 
through August 1, 2006. (Small Decl. II P 12.) This is a relatively small amount of time for a settlement class action 
of this size. See, e.g., Stuart J. Logan, Dr. Jack Moshman & Beverly C. Moore, Jr., Attorney Fee Awards in 
12 The import of this absence of objections, while significant, should not be overstated. As the Third Circuit has noted, ""[c]lass 
members may have little incentive to oppose a fee request, since any reduction will only result in a minor increase in their share 
of the settlement."" In re AT&T, 455 F.3d 160, 2006 WL 2021033, at *6. 
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 56744, *68

 
Common Fund Class Actions, 24 Class Action Rep. 167-234 (2003) (surveying, inter alia, class action cases that 
resulted in a recovery of $ 20-30 million and indicating that, of the 23 such cases which reported total hours 
awarded toward attorneys' fees, only one reported a total of less than 6,000 hours). HN34[
] While ""[t]he Court 
recognizes that Plaintiffs' counsel should not be penalized for prosecuting this case in an efficient manner,"" the 
Court nonetheless ""may consider the amount of time devoted to a case by counsel as disfavoring the requested 
fee."" Stop & Shop, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9705, 2005 WL 1213926, at *12. Consequently, the Court finds that the 
amount of time devoted to this case by Plaintiffs' Counsel weighs against the requested fees. 
7. Awards in similar cases
This factor requires the Court to compare the percentage of recovery requested as a fee in this case against the 
percentage of recovery awarded as a [*73]  fee in other common fund cases in which the percentage of recovery 
method, rather than the lodestar method, was used. In re Cendant Corp. PRIDES Litig., 243 F.3d at 737. As stated 
above, Plaintiffs' Counsel's request for attorneys' fees in this case produces a 27.4% percentage of recovery.
The Court finds that this percentage of recovery falls within a reasonable range of awards in similar cases. ""In the 
normal range of common fund recoveries in securities and antitrust suits, common fee awards fall in the 20 to 33 
per cent range."" 4 Herbert B. Newberg & Alba Conte, Newberg on Class Actions § 14:6 (4th ed. 2006). In In re Rite 
Aid, the Third Circuit noted three studies which found that fee awards ranging between 25-33% of the common fund 
were not unusual. In re Rite Aid,396 F.3d at 303 (""[O]ne study of securities class action settlements over $ 10 
million . . . found an average percentage fee recovery of 31%; a second study by the Federal Judicial Center of all 
class actions resolved or settled over a four-year period . . . found a median percentage recovery range of 27-30%; 
and a third study of class action settlements between $ 100 million [*74]  and $ 200 million . . . found recoveries in 
the 25-30% range were 'fairly standard.'"") (citation omitted). In 2003, the Class Action Reporter published a survey 
of fee awards in common fund class actions. See Logan et al., supra. This survey included 65 cases that fell within 
the $ 20-30 million recovery range; these cases averaged a percentage of recovery of 25.8%. 13 Id. at 174. 
In addition to considering the survey data, the Court notes that attorneys' fee awards ranging between 20-33% of 
common funds comparably sized to the present Settlement Fund have been approved by judges within the Third 
Circuit on numerous [*75]  occasions. See, e.g., In re Ravisent Technologies, Inc. Sec. Litig., 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
6680, Civ. A. No. 00-1014, 2005 WL 906361, at *11 (E.D. Pa. Apr. 18, 2005) (noting that ""courts within th[e Third 
Circuit] have typically awarded attorneys' fees of 30% to 35% of the recovery, plus expenses.""); In re Rent-Way, 
305 F. Supp. 2d at 519 (approving attorneys' fees award of 25% of a $ 25 million settlement fund); In re Warfarin, 
212 F.R.D. at 262-63 (approving 22.5% of $ 44.5 million settlement); Lazy Oil Co. v. Witco Corp., 95 F. Supp. 2d 
290, 322-23 (W.D. Pa. 1997) (approving 28% of an $ 18.9 million settlement fund). Accordingly, the Court finds that 
Plaintiffs' Counsel's request does not substantially deviate from the percentage of recovery awarded as fees in 
similar common fund cases, and that this factor favors the requested fees. The Court concludes that, of the seven 
Gunter factors, only one - the amount of time devoted to the case by Plaintiffs' Counsel - disfavors the requested 
award of attorneys' fees in this case. This one factor is outweighed by the other Gunter considerations that favor the 
requested award. Accordingly,  [*76]  the Court finds that, under the Gunter analysis, the percentage of recovery 
requested as attorneys' fees in this case is reasonable. 
8. The Prudential factors
The Court's assessment of Plaintiffs' Counsel's request for attorneys' fees in light of the three Prudential factors is 
consistent with the Court's finding of reasonableness under the Gunter factors. The first Prudential factor is 
intended to measure whether ""the entire value of the benefits accruing to class members is properly attributable to 
the efforts of class counsel,"" In re AT&T, 455 F.3d 160, 2006 WL 2021033, at *11, or if some of those benefits are 
more properly attributed ""to the efforts of other groups, such as government agencies conducting investigations."" 
13 This survey calculated percentage of recovery by lumping the awards of attorneys' fees and expenses and dividing that sum 
by the aggregate class recovery, which differs from the methodology employed by the Court. For the sake of comparison, 
applying this survey's method of calculation to the present case would render a percentage of recovery for Plaintiffs' Counsel of 
28.4%. 
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 56744, *72

 
455 F.3d 160, [WL] at *4 (citing In re Prudential, 148 F.3d at 338). While Plaintiffs' Counsel were not aided in their 
prosecution of this case by a government investigation, Plaintiffs' Counsel did have the benefit of prior litigation 
which assigned liability to 3M for the same sort of anti-competitive conduct that has been alleged here. Compare 
Stop & Shop, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9705, 2005 WL 1213926, at *12 (""[T]his action was [*77]  riskier than many 
other antitrust class actions because there was no prior government investigation, or prior finding of civil or criminal 
liability based on antitrust violations, in this case.""). The Court finds that this factor is neutral with respect to the 
reasonableness of the requested attorneys' fees.
As for the second Prudential factor, the Court finds that the 27.4% percentage of recovery requested in this case is 
comparable to the likely ""percentage fee that would have been negotiated had the case been subject to a private 
contingent fee agreement at the time counsel was retained."" In re AT&T, 455 F.3d 160, 2006 WL 2021033, at *4 
(citing In re Prudential, 148 F.3d at 340). See In re Remeron Direct Purchaser Antitrust Litig., 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
27013, at *46 (""Attorneys regularly contract for contingent fees between 30% and 40% with their clients in non-
class, commercial litigation.""); see also In re Aetna, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 68, 2001 WL 20928, at *14 (""[A]n award 
of thirty percent is in line with what is routinely privately negotiated in contingency fee tort litigation.""); In re Ikon, 194 
F.R.D. at 194 (""[I]n private [*78]  contingency fee cases, particularly in tort matters, plaintiffs' counsel routinely 
negotiate agreements providing for between thirty and forty percent of any recovery.""). With respect to the third 
Prudential factor, the Settlement here contains no particularly ""innovative"" terms to argue in favor of the requested 
award of attorneys' fees. In re AT&T, 455 F.3d 160, 2006 WL 2021033, at *4 (citing In re Prudential, 148 F.3d at 
339). In sum, the Court finds that the Prudential factors are largely neutral with respect to Plaintiffs' Counsel's 
request, and thus that they do not alter the Court's conclusion of reasonableness under the Gunter factors. 
Accordingly, the Court finds that the percentage of recovery requested by Plaintiffs' Counsel for attorneys' fees in 
this case is reasonable. 
9. Lodestar cross-check
HN35[
] The Third Circuit has suggested that, in addition to reviewing the fee award reasonableness factors, ""it is 
'sensible' for district courts to 'cross-check' the percentage fee award against the 'lodestar' method."" In re Rite Aid, 
396 F.3d at 305 (citing In re Prudential, 148 F.3d at 333). The lodestar [*79]  is calculated by ""multiplying the 
number of hours worked by the normal hourly rates of counsel. The court may then multiply the lodestar calculation 
to reflect the risks of nonrecovery, to reward an extraordinary result, or to encourage counsel to undertake socially 
useful litigation."" In re Aetna, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 68, 2001 WL 20928, at *15 (citing In re Ikon, 194 F.R.D. at 
195). ""The lodestar cross-check serves the purpose of alerting the trial judge that when the multiplier is too great, 
the court should reconsider its calculation under the percentage-of-recovery method, with an eye toward reducing 
the award."" In re Rite Aid, 396 F.3d at 306. The cross-check, however, ""does not trump the primary reliance on the 
percentage of common fund method."" Id. at 307. Moreover, ""[t]he lodestar cross-check calculation need entail 
neither mathematical precision nor bean-counting. The district courts may rely on summaries submitted by the 
attorneys and need not review actual billing records. . . . [T]he resulting multiplier need not fall within any pre-
defined range, provided that the District Court's analysis justifies the award.""Id. at 306-07 [*80]  (footnotes and 
citations omitted). It is appropriate for the court to consider the multipliers utilized in comparable cases. Id. at 307 
n.17.
The total lodestar amount submitted to the Court by the three firms comprising Plaintiffs' Counsel in this case is $ 
1,572,775.50 for 4,508.55 hours of attorney and paralegal time. 14 (Small Decl. II P 12.) The lodestar amount 
covers work done from the inception of the claims in this action through August 1, 2006, and is calculated at each 
firm's current rates, which are based on the prevailing rates for cases of this type in the community in which the 
attorneys practice. (Small Decl. P 67; Small Decl. II PP 9-11.) The hours worked were recorded contemporaneously 
in the books and records that the firms maintained in the ordinary course of business; they do not include any work 
14 The breakdown amidst the three firms is as follows: CMHT, indicating a lodestar of $ 944,551 for 2,885.05 hours (resulting in 
an hourly rate of $ 327.40); VVM, indicating a lodestar of $ 436,199 for 1,133.60 hours (hourly rate of $ 384.79); and TRR, 
indicating a lodestar of $ 192,025.50 for 489.90 hours (hourly rate of $ 391.97). (Small Decl. P 69, Small Decl. II P 12.) 
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 56744, *76

 
done in connection with Plaintiffs' Counsel's application for fees. (Id.) The lodestar amount, taken against the 
requested fee award of $ 7.5 million, results in a lodestar multiplier of 4.77. 
 [*81]  The Third Circuit has recognized that multipliers ""'ranging from one to four are frequently awarded in 
common fund cases when the lodestar method is applied.'"" In re Cendant PRIDES,243 F.3d at 742 (quotingIn re 
Prudential, 148 F.3d at 341). While a 4.77 multiplier is slightly above average, it is not far outside the range of 
normal awards. See In re Linerboard, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10532, 2004 WL 1221350, at *16 (noting that ""during 
2001-2003, the average multiplier approved in common fund class actions was 4.35"") (citing Logan, et al., supra, at 
167). Moreover, the lack of objections by this Class of sophisticated parties to Plaintiffs' Counsel's request for fees 
supports the resulting multiplier. See Stop & Shop, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9705, 2005 WL 1213926, at *18 (noting 
that ""the high lodestar multiplier (15.6) which results from the Court's award of attorneys' fees in this case is 
neutralized . . . by the extraordinary support Plaintiffs have shown for counsels' request for fees. Not one member of 
the Settlement Class, which is made up of approximately 90 sophisticated businesses, objected""). Accordingly, the 
Court finds that, given the facts of this case, the [*82]  requested lodestar multiplier of 4.77 is acceptable and does 
not call for a reduction in Plaintiffs' Counsel's requested attorneys' fees award.
Having thoroughly reviewed Plaintiffs' Counsel's request for attorneys' fees, the Court concludes that the 
percentage of recovery requested by Plaintiffs' Counsel is reasonable, and that the lodestar cross-check is 
consistent with a finding of reasonableness. Accordingly, the Court approves Plaintiffs' Counsel's request for $ 7.5 
million in attorneys' fees to be paid from the Settlement Fund.
C. Incentive Award to Representative Plaintiffs
Meijer has asked the Court to approve an incentive award in the amount of $ 25,000 to be paid from the Settlement 
Fund, because Meijer allegedly has spent a significant amount of its own time and expense litigating this case for 
the absent members of the Settlement Class. HN36[
] ""'Courts routinely approve incentive awards to compensate 
named plaintiffs for the services they provided and the risks they incurred during the course of the class action 
litigation.'"" Cullen v. Whitman Med. Corp., 197 F.R.D. 136, 145 (E.D. Pa. 2000) (quoting In re S. Ohio Corr. Facility, 
175 F.R.D. 270, 272 (S.D. Ohio 1997)). [*83]  It is particularly appropriate to compensate named representative 
plaintiffs with incentive awards when they have actively assisted plaintiffs' counsel in their prosecution of the 
litigation for the benefit of the class. See Tenuto v. Transworld Sys., Inc., 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1764, Civ. A. No. 
99-4228, 2002 WL 188569, at *5 (E.D. Pa. Jan. 31, 2002); see also In re Linerboard, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10532, 
2004 WL 1221350, at *18 (""Like the attorneys in this case, the class representatives have conferred benefits on all 
other class members and they deserve to be compensated accordingly."") (citing In re Plastic Tableware Antitrust 
Litig., Civ. A. No. 94-3564, 2002 WL 188569 (E.D. Pa. Dec. 4, 1998)).
Meijer has worked closely with Plaintiffs' Counsel throughout the investigation, prosecution and settlement of the 
claims in this litigation. (Mem. in Supp. of Pls.' Counsel's Mot. for Attys' Fees, Expenses, and Incentive Award at 
21.) Furthermore, the Notice advised Class Members that Meijer would apply for an incentive award in this amount 
and there were no objections to the award. See In re Remeron Direct Purchaser Antitrust Litig., 2005 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 27013, at *50. Lastly,  [*84]  the incentive award requested in this case is similar to the awards approved in 
comparable complex class actions in this District. See id. at *52 (approving a total incentive award of $ 60,000 to 
two named plaintiffs); In re Linerboard, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10532, 2004 WL 1221350, at *19 (approving 
incentive awards of $ 25,000 to each of five named plaintiffs); In re Residential Doors Antitrust Litig., 1998 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 4292, MDL No. 1039, 1998 WL 151804, at *11 (E.D. Pa. Apr. 2, 1998) (approving $ 10,000 incentive awards 
to each of four named plaintiffs). Accordingly, the Court approves the requested incentive award.
V. CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, the Court concludes that the Settlement Class meets the certification requirements of 
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 and approves the Class's final certification for settlement purposes. The Court 
also concludes that the Settlement Agreement and Distribution Plan are fair, adequate and reasonable, and 
approves them. The Court further concludes that Plaintiffs' Counsel's requested reimbursement of expenses in the 
amount of $ 390,452.46 and requested award of attorneys' fees in the amount of $  [*85]  7.5 million are fair and 
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 56744, *80

 
reasonable, and approves them. Lastly, the Court approves Meijer's request to be paid an incentive award in the 
amount of $ 25,000. An appropriate Order follows.

arising in any way from any 3M discount, rebate, offer, promotion or other sales program or practice (including

arising under any federal and/or state antitrust laws, unfair competition laws, consumer protection laws or 
deceptive trade practices acts or any similar statutory or common law provisions,but excluding from this

of claims relating to any alleged product defect, personal injury or breach of contract, this release is a ""general 
release"" as that term is used in Section 1542 of the Civil Code of the State of California and all members of the 
Settlement Class that have not opted out will expressly waive any rights under that statute or any similar law of 
any state or territory of the United States or any principle of common law that is similar, comparable, or 
equivalent to Section 1542 of the California Civil Code.
4.3. Upon the Effective Date, each Settlement Class Member, on behalf of themselves and, with respect to 
individuals or individually [*97]  owned businesses, on behalf of each of their heirs, predecessors, successors, 
representatives or assigns, and, with respect to corporate entities, on behalf of each of their parents, subsidiaries, 
affiliates, assignees, predecessors, successors, officers, directors, employees and agents, shall have, shall be 
deemed to have and by operation of this Judgment shall have fully, finally and forever released, relinquished and

agreed not to sue 3M or its attorneys with respect to the Released Claims.
4.4. The following injunction is hereby entered: All members of the Settlement Class are permanently enjoined from 
filing, commencing, initiating, asserting, continuing to prosecute, intervening in, participating in or maintaining in any

the parties to the Settlement Agreement [*99]  and is final and shall be immediately appealable. Neither this Order 
nor the Settlement Agreement shall constitute any evidence or admission of liability by 3M, nor shall either 
document or any other document relating to the Settlement be offered in evidence or used for any other purpose in 
this or any other matter or proceeding except as may be necessary to consummate or enforce the Settlement 
Agreement or the terms of this Order or if offered by 3M in responding to any action purporting to assert Released 
Claims. 
VII.
RETENTION OF JURISDICTION
7.1. Without affecting the finality of this Order, the Court retains jurisdiction for the purposes of enforcing the terms 
of the injunction set forth in paragraph 4.4 of this Order and enabling any of the Settling Parties to apply to this 
Court at any time for such further orders and directions as may be necessary and appropriate for the construction or

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
VII. DEFENDANTS HAVE VIOLATED 18 U.S.C. 1962(c)
A. Introduction
The United States established by a preponderance of the evidence that Defendants and others comprised an 
association-in-fact enterprise (""Enterprise"") and that each Defendant participated in the conduct, management, and 
operation of the Enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c); see, e.g., 
Sedima v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479, 491, 105 S. Ct. 3275, 87 L. Ed. 2d 346 (1985); Yellow Bus Lines, Inc. v. 
Drivers, Chauffers & Helpers Local Union 639, 913 F.2d 948, 954, 286 U.S. App. D.C. 182 (D.C. Cir. 1990); United 
States v. Local 560, Int'l Bhd. of Teamsters, 780 F.2d 267, 280 n.12 (3d Cir. 1985). Section 1962(c) provides:
It shall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities 
of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of 
such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt.
18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). The United States has proven this violation by establishing each of the following elements:
• The existence of an enterprise;
• The [*2341]  enterprise was engaged in, or its activities affected, interstate or foreign commerce;
• Each defendant was employed by or associated with the enterprise;
• Each defendant conducted or participated, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of the affairs of the enterprise;
• Each defendant committed at least two acts of racketeering within 10 years of one another; and
• The racketeering acts constitute a pattern of racketeering activity.
See, e.g., Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479, 496-97, 105 S. Ct. 3275, 87 L. Ed. 2d 346 (1985); United 
States v. Hoyle, 122 F.3d 48, 50, 326 U.S. App. D.C. 310 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (listing elements); United States v. Philip 
Morris USA, 316 F. Supp. 2d 13, 16 (D.D.C. 2004).
All the alleged predicate racketeering acts in this case involve mail or wire fraud offenses, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 
1341 or § 1343. The mail fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1341, provides in relevant part:
Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or 
property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises . . . for the purpose of 
executing such scheme or artifice or attempting so to do, [mails or causes the mailing of any matter] . . . shall 
be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both.
To establish an offense under § 1341 (or § 1343), the plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of evidence the 
following elements:
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118375, *2339

 
• The defendant knowingly devised or intended [*2342]  to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud a victim of 
money or property, or the defendant knowingly devised or intended to devise any scheme for obtaining money 
or property by means of material false or fraudulent, representations, pretenses, or promises, and
• The defendant mailed any matter, or caused the mailing of any matter (or sent or caused to be send by 
interstate wire transmission), for the purpose of furthering or executing such scheme or artifice, and
• The defendant acted with the specific intent to defraud or deceive.
See Neder v. United States, 527 U.S. 1, 24-25, 119 S. Ct. 1827, 144 L. Ed. 2d 35 (1999); United States v. Philip 
Morris USA, 304 F. Supp. 2d 60, 69 (D.D.C. 2004). The extensive, detailed Findings of Fact set forth above, 
establish --overwhelmingly -- that Defendants devised a scheme to defraud and used mailings and wire 
transmissions for the purpose of furthering it. The purpose of the scheme was to obtain, from smokers and potential 
smokers, money, i.e., the cost of cigarettes, to fill the coffers of the corporate Defendants. Put more colloquially, 
and less legalistically, over the course of more than 50 years, Defendants lied, misrepresented, and deceived the 
American public, including smokers and the young people they avidly sought as ""replacement smokers,"" about the 
devastating health effects of smoking [*2343]  and environmental tobacco smoke, they suppressed research, they 
destroyed documents, they manipulated the use of nicotine so as to increase and perpetuate addiction, they 
distorted the truth about low tar and light cigarettes so as to discourage smokers from quitting, and they abused the 
legal system in order to achieve their goal -- to make money with little, if any, regard for individual illness and 
suffering, soaring health costs, or the integrity of the legal system.
B. Defendants Engaged in a Scheme to Defraud Smokers and Potential Smokers
The Government has proven that the Enterprise knowingly and intentionally engaged in a scheme to defraud 
smokers and potential smokers, for purposes of financial gain, by making false and fraudulent statements, 
representations, and promises. Defendants participated in the Enterprise's overarching scheme to defraud smokers 
and potential smokers in order to maximize their profits by preserving and enhancing the market for cigarettes, to 
avoid costly liability judgments, to derail attempts to make smoking socially unacceptable, and to sustain the 
cigarette industry.
In order to carry out this scheme, Defendants made the following false and fraudulent [*2344]  statements in a 
number of areas, including: (1) deceiving consumers into starting and continuing to buy and smoke cigarettes by 
misrepresenting and concealing the adverse health effects caused by smoking and exposure to environmental 
cigarette smoke, by maintaining that there was an ""open question"" as to whether smoking cigarettes causes 
disease and other adverse effects, despite the fact that Defendants knew otherwise, and by ensuring that their 
research, development, and marketing of cigarettes remained consistent with these core public positions (see 
Findings of Fact V(A)); (2) deceiving consumers into becoming or staying addicted to cigarettes by maintaining that 
neither smoking nor nicotine is addictive, despite the fact that Defendants knew these positions were false (see 
Findings of Fact V(B)); (3) deceiving consumers into becoming or staying addicted to cigarettes by manipulating the 
design of cigarettes and the delivery of nicotine to smokers, while at the same time denying that they engaged in 
such efforts (see Findings of Fact V(C)); (4) deceiving consumers, particularly parents and young people, by 
denying that they marketed to youth, while engaging in such marketing and [*2345]  advertising with the intent of 
addicting young people and enticing them to become lifelong smokers (see Findings of Fact V(F)); and (5) 
deceiving consumers through deceptive marketing and cigarette design modifications to exploit smokers' desire for 
less hazardous and ""low tar"" cigarettes which Defendants knew to be no safer than full-flavor cigarettes (see 
Findings of Fact V(G)).
The individual components must be viewed not independently but in context of the entire scheme to defraud.10 It is 
sufficient to prove by the totality of the circumstances that the defendant devised a scheme intended to defraud 
which included one or more of the individual component schemes alleged. See, e.g., Philip Morris, 304 F. Supp. 2d 
10 The Government presented this case as one overarching scheme based upon seven pillars. The Court is not bound by the 
Government's conceptual analysis and did not find it the most useful approach.

The mail and wire fraud violations underlying the RICO violations cover any ""scheme...to defraud, or for obtaining 
money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises."" 18 U.S.C. §§ 1342, 
1343. Defendants claim that their public statements do not constitute Racketeering Acts and were not in furtherance 
of a scheme to defraud because they were simply statements of opinion held in good faith. de Mango v. United 
States, 636 F.2d 714, 720 n.9 (D.C. Cir. 1980) (""[A] statement of opinion [*2346]  cannot constitute fraud""). This 
argument is unpersuasive.
First, in light of the overwhelming evidence of what the Enterprise as a whole and individual Defendants knew, it is 
absurd to believe that the highly-ranked representatives and agents of these corporations and entities had no 
knowledge that their public statements were false and fraudulent. The Findings of Fact are replete with examples of 
C.E.O.s, Vice-Presidents, and Directors of Research and Development, as well as the Defendants' lawyers, making 
statements which were inconsistent with the internal knowledge and practice of the corporation itself. To call such 
statements ""opinions,"" strains credulity.
Second, while federal courts have demonstrated a willingness to find vague statements or ""rosy affirmations"" by a 
company spokesman insufficient to hold a company liable for fraud, see In re Ford Motor Co. Secs. Litig., 381 F.3d 
563, 571 (6th Cir. 2004) (quoting Shaw v. Digital Equip. Corp., 82 F.3d 1194, 1217 (1st Cir. 1996)) (finding that 
vague statements by corporate mangers and spokespersons are not actionable for securities fraud because no 
reasonable investor would have relied on them), that approach is not appropriate for statements whose falsity can 
be proved ""through the orthodox evidentiary process,"" Va. Bankshares, Inc. v. Sandberg, 501 U.S. 1083, 1090, 
1091-93, 111 S. Ct. 2749, 115 L. Ed. 2d 929 (1991). Indeed, where objective data is available to [*2347]  disprove a 
statement or demonstrate that it is misleading at the time it was made, a public statement of opinion by a company 
spokesperson can constitute actionable fraud. See City of Monroe Employees Retirement System v. Bridgestone 
Corp., 387 F.3d 468, 487-492 (6th Cir. 2004) (holding that even if a statement alluding to objective data was 
classified as opinion, it was specific enough to form the basis of an actionable securities claim).
In the context of securities fraud litigation, courts have found that a ""statement of belief contains at least three 
implicit factual assertions: (1) that the statement is genuinely believed; (2) that there is [a] reasonable basis for that 
belief; and (3) that the speaker is not aware of any undisclosed facts tending to seriously undermine the accuracy of 
the statement. A projection or statement of belief may be actionable to the extent that one of these implied factual 
assertions is inaccurate."" In re Apple Computer Sec. Litigation, 886 F.2d 1109, 1113 (9th Cir. 1989). Accordingly, 
even where a speaker may not be aware of undisclosed facts and issues an opinion in supposed good faith, the 
statement will provide grounds for fraud where it can be proved that there is no reasonable basis for the speaker's 
belief. Were this not the case, companies would be able to shield themselves from liability by keeping their 
spokespersons [*2348]  in the dark about facts that are inconsistent with their public statements.
The analogy to securities fraud, though imperfect, is useful in this case. In securities fraud, a court tests the 
materiality of opinions issued by company spokespersons by determining whether a reasonable investor would 
have relied on the statement. Va. Bankshares, Inc. v. Sandberg, 501 U.S. at 1093-1094. In the case at bar, the 
materiality of public statements can be determined by assessing the public's reliance on those statements for their 
health and safety. When a spokesperson of a large, sophisticated corporation makes statements of what 
Defendants now characterize as ""opinion,"" but which can be proved false by information that was available and 
known to the corporation at the time, and the public relies on those statements, the company cannot be permitted to 
escape liability merely because it declined to inform that individual spokesperson that his or her statement was 
misleading. As courts have recognized in the securities fraud context, failure to disclose or correct a misleading 
statement, even a statement which may be characterized as an opinion, is of particular concern where the public 
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118375, *2345

 
does not have other information with which they can evaluate the [*2349]  reliability of the opinion that was stated. 
See Helwig v. Vencor, Inc., 251 F.3d 540, 559-561 (6th Cir. 2001).
The totality of the evidence proves Defendants' wide reaching and pervasive scheme to defraud consumers and 
potential consumers of cigarettes. As established at trial and explained below, Defendants coordinated their public 
relations, research, cigarette design and marketing efforts in order to advance their overarching scheme to defraud 
by: (1) denying the adverse health effects of active smoking; (2) denying the addictiveness of nicotine and cigarette 
smoking; (3) denying their manipulation of the nicotine content of cigarettes; (4) misrepresenting the health risks 
attached to light and low tar cigarettes; (5) denying their marketing to youth; (6) denying the adverse health effects 
of secondhand smoke; and (7) suppressing, concealing, and destroying information and documents related to the 
adverse health effects of smoking. The Court will address each area, seriatim.
1. Defendants Falsely Denied the Adverse Health Effects of Smoking
Smoking is a cause of significant disease and death. The evidence presented in this case demonstrates the extent 
of suffering by smokers and former smokers. Cigarette smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke [*2350]  kills 
440,000 Americans every year, or more than 1,200 every single day. The annual number of deaths due to cigarette 
smoking is substantially greater than the combined annual number of deaths due to illegal drug use, alcohol 
consumption, automobile accidents, fires, homicides, suicides, and AIDS. Approximately one out of every five 
deaths that occur in the United States is caused by cigarette smoking. See Findings of Fact, V(A)(1).
Defendants' joint efforts to deny and distort the health effects of cigarette smoking consisted of making numerous 
widely disseminated public statements that denied or questioned smoking's harms; attacking legitimate scientific 
investigation; continually calling for more research; and, years after questions of causation were resolved in the 
public health community, repeatedly promising to determine through ""objective"" research by ""independent"" 
scientists, whether smoking was a cause of disease.11
Defendants' efforts to deny and distort the scientific evidence of smoking's harms are demonstrated by not only 
decades of press releases, reports, booklets, newsletters, television and radio appearances, and scientific 
symposia and publications, but also by evidence [*2351]  of their concerted, efforts to attack and undermine the 
studies in mainstream scientific publications such as the Reports of the Surgeon General. The intense public 
relations activity -- consisting of numerous press releases, advertisements, and other false statements -- before and 
particularly after publication of the 1964 Surgeon General's Report on Smoking and Health (the first to announce 
the consensus of the scientific and public health community that smoking caused disease and death), is but one 
example. See Findings of Fact Section V(A)(3)(c) and V(A)(5)(c). This continued despite widespread internal 
acknowledgment among Defendants' executives and scientists that smoking causes disease. See, e.g., Farone 
WD, 66:1-18 (""There was widespread acceptance that smoking caused disease. I never talked with a scientist at 
Philip Morris who said that smoking doesn't cause disease."").
Even after the 1964 Report, a February 26, 1972 Tobacco Institute press release asserted that the 1972 Surgeon 
General's Report, which announced the consensus of the scientific and public health community that smoking 
causes chronic obstructive bronchopulmonary disease (COPD) and other cardiovascular diseases, [*2352]  as well 
as cancer, ""insults the scientific community"" and that the report was ""another example of 'press conference science' 
-- an absolute masterpiece of bureaucratic obfuscation."" The press release also asserted that ""the number one 
health problem is not cigarette smoking, but is the extent to which public health officials may knowingly mislead the 
American public."" TIMN 0210602-03 at 0602 (US 21322).
Of paramount significance is that Defendants' internal documents openly acknowledge the purpose of their public 
relations strategy. For example, William Kloepfer, Vice President of Public Relations for the Tobacco Institute, wrote 
to Earle Clements, President of the Tobacco Institute admitting his concern about the purpose: ""Our basic position 
11 The alleged Racketeering Acts relating to this component of the scheme to defraud are Racketeering Act Nos. 1-3, 5, 7, 10-
14, 18, 23, 24, 26, 27, 29, 30, 33, 34, 38, 42, 43, 46, 50, 51, 54, 57, 62, 64, 65, 82, 85, 92, 99, 105-107, 115, 120, & 123.

in the cigarette controversy is subject to the charge, and may be subject to a finding, that we are making false or 
misleading statements to promote the sale of cigarettes."" TIMN0072354-56 at 2354 (US 63576). The Tobacco 
Institute's 1968 internal ""Tobacco and Health Research Procedural Memo"" advised: ""The most important type of 
story is that which casts doubt on the cause and effect theory of disease and smoking. . . . [T]he headline should 
strongly [*2353]  call out the point — Controversy! Contradiction! Other factors! Unknowns!"" TIMN0071488-91 at 
1489 (US 21302). Similarly, an undated internal B&W document titled ""Smoking and Health Proposal"" explained: 
""Doubt is our product since it is the best means of competing with the 'body of fact' that exists in the mind of the 
general public. It is also the means of establishing a controversy."" 690010951-0959 at 0959 (US 21040).
As another example, in a 1975 marketing document, B&W acknowledged the necessity of continuing the ""open 
controversy"" strategy:
Smokers perceive cigarette smoking as dangerous for one's health. However, they continue to smoke. Thus, 
they are faced with the fact that they are behaving illogically. They respond by providing either a rationalization 
for smoking or by repressing their perceptions of the dangers involved. . . . The advertising must also cope with 
consumer attitudes about smoking, providing either a rationale or a means of repressing the health concern.
680113760-3763 at 3761-3762 (US 20987).
Defendants understood that most individuals, when starting to smoke, do not adequately appreciate the full risk 
associated with smoking to make an informed decision about [*2354]  whether or not to engage in smoking 
behavior. In fact, the evidence shows that most people's knowledge of the nature and consequences of diseases 
caused by smoking tends to be superficial. See Findings of Fact Section V(B); Slovic WD, 18:14-20:5; Weinstein 
WD, 24:7-29:22.
Using the sophisticated and well-organized machinery created to serve their agenda, Defendants fraudulently 
denied the adverse health effects of smoking for at least 40 years in order to sustain the appearance of an open 
controversy about the link between smoking and disease, and thereby maintain and enhance the cigarette market 
and their collective revenues.
2. Defendants Falsely Denied that Nicotine and Smoking Are Addictive
Defendants have made and continue to make false and fraudulent statements about the addictiveness of nicotine 
and smoking.12 Fact and expert testimony, as well as Defendants' internal documents spanning five decades, firmly 
establish that Defendants have intended their statements about addiction to further the Enterprise's scheme to 
defraud by concealing what Defendants openly recognized internally — that smoking is an addiction driven primarily 
by the pharmacological effects of nicotine.
Defendants' [*2355]  internal research reflects their understanding that nicotine is the most important chemical 
delivered by cigarettes because it is what compels smokers to smoke. Their product research and development 
efforts had the overriding objective of harnessing and manipulating the power of nicotine and ensuring that their 
marketed products delivered enough nicotine to create and sustain addiction.13
By the early 1980s, the medical and scientific communities recognized that the results of clinical observations, 
laboratory research, and population studies together justified the conclusion that tobacco-delivered nicotine was 
addictive. Henningfield TT, 11/22/04, 6811:11-6812:2.
12 The alleged Racketeering Acts relating to this component of the scheme to defraud are Racketeering Act Nos. 15, 25, 30, 56, 
58, 60, 63, 71, 72, 74, 75, 79, 81, 103, 104, 109, 110, 114, 116, 132, & 133.
13 Indeed, to this day none of Defendant cigarette manufacturers publicly admit that nicotine is an addictive drug delivered in 
cigarettes. Defendants' current public statements on addiction avoid any mention of nicotine, let alone its role in addiction. See 
Findings of Fact Section V(B)(4)(j). Dr. Jack Henningfield and Dr. Michael Eriksen both testified that Defendants' current 
statements about addiction omit material information and are not fully consistent with the conclusions of the medical and 
scientific communities. Henningfield WD, 104:23-109:22; Eriksen TT, 5/16/05, 21248:20-21249:15.
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118375, *2352

 
In response to the emergence of a scientific consensus on this issue in the early 1980s, Defendants began making 
four types of public statements: (1) Smoking cigarettes is not addictive because some smokers can, and do, quit 
smoking on their own (e.g., ""smoking is a truly personal choice which can be stopped if and when a person decides 
to do so"" (no bates) (US 22727); (2) Smoking cigarettes is not addictive because it does not lead to physical 
""dependence"" (e.g., ""the claim that there is a physical dependence to smoking [*2356]  is simply a desperate 
attempt to find some way to differentiate smoking from other habits"" (no bates) (US 85366); (3) Smoking cigarettes 
is not addictive because it does not induce ""intoxication"" (e.g., ""Tobacco is not intoxicating, in direct contrast to any 
other substance that has been claimed to be addictive, from heroin and cocaine through to alcohol"" (no bates) (US 
23036); (4) Smoking cigarettes is not addictive because cigarettes are not like other addictive drugs -- rather, 
smoking is merely a pleasurable behavior (e.g., the ""attachment"" to smoking is in the same category as ""tennis, 
jogging, candy, rock music, Coca-Cola, members of the opposite sex and hamburgers"" (no bates) (US 65625) 
(CEO of Philip Morris analogized smoking to eating Gummi Bears saying ""I don't like it when I don't eat my Gummi 
Bears, but I'm certainly not addicted to them,"" Morgan PD, Broin v. Philip Morris, et al., 4/17/97, 77:20-78:23).
As to the first category of statements, there is simply no evidence in the record to support the assertion that 
smoking is not addictive because a smoker can voluntarily quit. Not a single defense witness could provide any 
support, scientific or otherwise, for this proposition. [*2357]  See Dawson WD, 49:5-20; Rowell TT, 16678:21-
16679:4; Keane WD, 22:9-14.
As to the second and third categories of public statements, Defendants cited to characteristics of addictive drugs — 
physical dependence14 and intoxication — as essential markers of addiction when they knew they were not and 
had not been considered so by the scientific community for decades. See Findings of Fact Section V(B)(2)(b). In 
making these types of statements, Defendants sought to distort the terminology of addiction by relying on criteria 
which are no longer recognized by the scientific community. Additionally, Defendants' public statements directly 
contradicted their own internal recognition that smoking could actually cause intoxication. See, e.g., Farone WD, 
72:19-74:3, 78:17-80:14 (discussing basis for conclusion that Defendants understood smoking to be addictive and 
Philip Morris's knowledge of nicotine's role in smoking addiction). Defendants similarly understood that smokers 
experience withdrawal symptoms upon cessation. 1000348671-8751 at 8676, 8708 (US 20097) (1971 Philip Morris 
document stating that a realistic view of cessation would show ""a restless, nervous, constipated husband bickering 
viciously [*2358]  with his bitchy wife who is nagging him about his slothful behavior and growing waistline"").
Finally, as to the fourth category of statements, Defendants denied to the public what they recognized internally 
beginning as early as the 1950s: people smoke primarily because of the pharmacological effects of the drug 
nicotine. Defendants' own nicotine expert, Dr. Rowell, readily agreed that smoking cigarettes involves use of a drug 
and is not comparable to non-drug ""habits"" cited by Defendants in their public statements, such as jogging, playing 
tennis, or nailbiting. Rowell TT, 3/24/05, 16685:5-16687:19, 16633:24-1634:10. The Findings of Fact recount at 
great length and in great detail that Defendants knew smoking was addictive because of nicotine. See generally 
Findings of Fact Section V(B)(3). Indeed, documents consistently reflect that Defendants considered themselves to 
be in the ""nicotine business"" because nicotine is the ""sine qua non"" of cigarettes. See, e.g., US 22848 at 7837-7839 
(Philip Morris in 1969: ""We have then as our first premise, that the primary motivation for smoking is to obtain the 
pharmacological effect of nicotine. . . . [N]one [of the psychological motives for smoking] [*2359]  are adequate to 
sustain the habit in the absence of nicotine.""); US 20659 at 5684-5685 (R.J. Reynolds' researcher in 1972: 
""Tobacco products, uniquely, contain and deliver nicotine, a potent drug with a variety of physiological effects. . . . 
[T]he confirmed user of tobacco products is primarily seeking the physiological 'satisfaction' derived from nicotine."").
Moreover, internal documents and testimony from former company employees affirmed that within their corporate 
walls, Defendants openly recognized the addictiveness of cigarettes. Dr. Farone testified that during his time at 
Philip Morris there was ""widespread acceptance internally throughout the company — among executives, scientists, 
14 ""Physical dependence"" and ""withdrawal"" are generally considered equivalent concepts. The occurrence of withdrawal 
symptoms upon removal of the dependence-producing agent is the marker for physical dependence. Rowell TT, 3/23/05, 
16701:10-13.
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118375, *2355

 
and marketing people"" that nicotine was primarily responsible for addiction to smoking. Farone WD, 72:21-73:1, 
74:10-23.
Defendants have intentionally maintained and coordinated their fraudulent position on addiction and nicotine as an 
important part of their overall efforts to influence public opinion and persuade people that smoking is not dangerous. 
By the use of this fraud, Defendants have kept more smokers smoking, recruited more new smokers, and 
maintained or increased revenues.
3. Defendants [*2360]  Falsely Denied that They Manipulated Cigarette Design and Composition so as to 
Assure Nicotine Delivery Levels Which Create and Sustain Addiction
Defendants recognized the relationship between nicotine delivery and continued cigarette sales. See generally 
Findings of Fact Section V(C)(1)(c). By delivering the optimum amount of nicotine, Defendants could keep people 
smoking, keep those already addicted satisfied, and therefore maintain or increase cigarette sales revenue. Based 
on this understanding, Defendants actively tried to ensure that smokers would continue to receive sufficient nicotine 
from cigarettes that would deliver reduced tar and nicotine measurements under the FTC Method. See generally 
Findings of Fact Section V(C)(2).
Defendants dedicated substantial resources to devising techniques to modify and manipulate the amount of nicotine 
that their products deliver. Defendants have studied extensively how every characteristic of every component of 
cigarettes -- including the tobacco blend, the paper, the filter, additives, and the manufacturing process -- affects 
nicotine delivery. They have utilized that understanding in designing their cigarettes. Defendants have designed 
their [*2361]  cigarettes with a central overriding objective -- to ensure that smokers obtain enough nicotine to 
create and sustain addiction.
Nevertheless, Defendants have publicly and fraudulently denied that they manipulate nicotine delivery. The 
evidence establishes that Defendants' statements denying manipulation of nicotine have been intentionally 
deceptive, misleading, or otherwise fraudulent when made. Through these and other false statements, Defendants 
have furthered their common efforts to deceive the public and carry out their fraudulent scheme.15
Defendants spent many millions of dollars and thousands of scientist hours over decades to ensure that smokers of 
all brands consumed sufficient nicotine to establish and maintain addiction. Defendants' own internal evidence 
shows that (a) they intended to manipulate the nicotine delivery of their cigarettes; (b) they employed numerous 
design techniques because they intended and believed that those techniques allowed them to successfully control 
nicotine delivery; and (c) these efforts were driven by Defendants' widespread understanding that nicotine is an 
addictive drug and that cigarette smoking is a drug-driven addiction.
Nevertheless, at the [*2362]  same time they were pursuing these techniques, Defendants fraudulently denied both 
their efforts to manipulate nicotine and their knowledge of nicotine's addictiveness. Defendants have publicly and 
fraudulently denied that they manipulate nicotine and falsely asserted that the level of nicotine in a cigarette is 
inextricably linked to the cigarette's tar level, that nicotine delivery levels automatically follow tar delivery levels in 
cigarette smoke, that nicotine is an essential flavorant, and that because they do not add ""extra"" nicotine to 
cigarettes they are not engaged in manipulating the delivery of nicotine through the smoke. For example, on a 
March 27, 1994, airing of ""Face the Nation,"" Brennan Dawson, Vice President of the Tobacco Institute, stated:
The industry does take the position that . . . not only do they not add nicotine, but they don't manipulate 
nicotine. So Congress has been told formally by every cigarette manufacturer in the United States that this 
claim is without foundation.
TLT0730851-1975 (US 77012). Through these and other false statements, Defendants have furthered their

4. Defendants Falsely Represented that Light and Low Tar Cigarettes Deliver Less Nicotine and Tar and, 
Therefore, Present Fewer Health Risks than Full-Flavor Cigarettes
The evidence establishes that the vast majority of people who smoke today want to quit due to health concerns. 
Defendants accurately perceive smokers' desire to quit as a significant threat to their economic welfare and 
possibly their existence; obviously, if sufficient numbers of smokers who want to quit actually do so, it will greatly 
diminish Defendants' earnings. In 1978, a Tobacco Institute document offered the following chilling assessment of 
the threat to Defendants' businesses: ""low tar cigarette smokers . . . are potential cigarette quitters. . . . And more of 
them than the average have tried to quit smoking. Since low tar smokers are an expanding share of the market, 
their greater desire to quit smoking poses a special problem for the cigarette industry."" 501565967-6019 at 6008 
(US 21866).
As part of a scheme to intercept potential quitters and dissuade them from giving up smoking, Defendants 
developed and introduced filtered and purportedly ""low tar and nicotine"" cigarettes. As their internal documents 
reveal, [*2364]  Defendants engaged in massive, sustained, and highly sophisticated marketing and promotional 
campaigns to portray their light brands as less harmful than regular cigarettes, and thus an acceptable alternative to 
quitting, while at the same time carefully avoiding any admission that their full-flavor cigarettes were harmful to 
smokers' health. Defendants knew that by providing worried smokers with health reassurance, they could keep 
them buying and smoking cigarettes.16
Defendants' efforts have been successful. Even though low tar smokers have a greater desire to quit, their 
misconception that low tar cigarettes are less harmful dissuades them from doing so. Current research 
demonstrates that approximately 50% of all smokers of lower tar cigarettes chose such products because they 
perceive them to be a ""healthier"" cigarette and a potential step toward quitting. Weinstein WD, 53:3-54:20; Benowitz 
WD, 60:8-22.
Defendants were aware, however, that because of nicotine addiction, smokers would not smoke ""health 
reassurance"" cigarettes if they failed to supply enough nicotine to sustain their addiction. Defendants therefore 
designed their low nicotine and low tar cigarettes with what they referred [*2365]  to as ""elasticity"" of delivery. This 
created the illusion that there would be less nicotine and less tar, but at the same time it would facilitate a smoker's 
ability to compensate for the reduced nicotine yield. As a result of smoker compensation, discussed in detail in the 
Findings of Facts, smokers inhale essentially the same amount of nicotine (and with it, tar) from low tar cigarettes 
as from regular cigarettes.
In short, Defendants have known for decades that filtered and low tar cigarettes do not offer a meaningful reduction 
of risk, and that their marketing which emphasized reductions in tar and nicotine was false and misleading. 
Defendants have known for decades that each smoker has a particular nicotine requirement that he or she must 
satisfy in order to sustain the addiction and, as a result, smokers will inhale the same amount of nicotine, and with it 
tar, from low tar cigarettes as they do from regular cigarettes. Benowitz WD, 55:11-22; 56:22-23; 57:5-9; 57:23-1; 
Benowitz TT, 11/2/04, 4762:23-24; 4763:14-16; Farone WD, 103:18-104:1; see also Findings of Fact Section 
V(E)(2).
Despite overwhelming evidence that Defendants intended to market low tar cigarettes in order to deter [*2366]  
potential quitters, Defendants have consistently maintained publicly that ""all of their marketing activities had one 
and only one purpose: to impact the brand choice of adults who had already chosen to smoke."" In addition, ""[t]he 
tobacco companies expressly stated they had no interest in either (1) increasing the likelihood of anyone's 
beginning to smoke or (2) decreasing the likelihood that a current smoker would quit."" Dolan WD, 56:3-14.
These public statements are blatantly false. For instance, Carolyn Levy, former Philip Morris Director of Consumer 
Research and Senior Vice President for Marketing and Sales Information, testified that at the same time Philip 
Morris was making public statements that it had no interest in intercepting quitters, she was conducting research on

2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118375, *2363

 
ways to deter smokers from quitting. Levy WD, 33:12-34:9, 34:23-35:2. Levy testified that Philip Morris was 
""studying the factors that influence quitting,"" including whether ""people quit because of health concerns,"" so that 
Philip Morris could ""design products or line extensions of existing brands that addressed those factors."" Asked if the 
purpose was ""[s]o that people would keep smoking Philip Morris cigarettes [*2367]  rather than quitting,"" Levy 
testified: ""Yes, if Philip Morris could design new products to address those concerns."" Levy WD, 31:9-22.
As part of the Enterprise's scheme to defraud smokers, Defendants withheld and suppressed their extensive 
knowledge and understanding of nicotine-driven smoker compensation. Farone WD, 112:23-113:10 (Defendants' 
superior knowledge of compensation was closely held within Philip Morris and the tobacco industry and there was 
an ""effort on the part of [his] co-workers at Philip Morris, including [his] supervisors, to restrict any public 
acknowledgment on the part of Philip Morris of the phenomena of compensation""). For example, a 1978 BATCo 
memorandum about its internal research stated:
In general, a majority of habitual smokers compensate for changed delivery, if they change to a lower delivery 
brand than their usual brand. . . . If they choose [a] lower delivery brand which has a higher tar to nicotine ratio 
than their usual brand (which is often the case with lower delivery products) the smokers will in fact increase 
the amounts of tar and gas phase that they take in, in order to take the same amount of nicotine.
105553905-3914 at 3905, 3907, 3913 (US 34799). [*2368]  In addition, there are lights of certain brands with higher 
tar levels than regulars of other brands from the same company, and there are also lights and regulars of the same 
brand that have the same FTC tar rating. For example, according to the most recent FTC report of tar and nicotine 
yields, Philip Morris sells versions of Virginia Slims and Virginia Slims Lights that both deliver 15 mg of tar as 
measured by the FTC method.
Defendants acknowledge that, today, every major manufacturer continues to manufacture and sell low tar brands 
and brand extensions in both the ""light"" and ""ultra light"" categories. Ivey WD, 54:6-17; Bonhomme WD, 8:13-9:18. 
Defendants use these so-called brand descriptors such as ""light,"" ""medium,"" and ""mild"" to market their brand 
extensions as low in tar with full knowledge that a substantial number of smokers interpret these descriptors as 
indicating a less harmful cigarette. See Findings of Fact Section V(E)(3).
The misleading nature of Defendants' design and marketing of filtered and low tar cigarettes continues. See 
generally Burns WD, 30:9-12; 62:5-7; Farone WD, 3:12-22; 4:20-22; 72:13-18; 115:19-116:2; Henningfield WD, 
55:13-56:7; 66:14-67:12; 82:16-19.
 [*2369] 5. Defendants Falsely Denied that They Market to Youth
Defendants engaged in coordinated activity in order to protect their ability to recruit new, youth smokers through 
cigarette marketing, often utilizing the same joint organizations that were initially created to carry out deceptive 
public relations campaigns related to disease risks. In order to protect each company's ability to continue to market 
to the teenagers who are of such vital importance to their continued survival as older smokers quit or die, 
Defendants have continually represented to the public, both through the Tobacco Institute and individually, that they 
do not market to youth, that their marketing is only aimed at adult smokers, and that their marketing has no impact 
on youth smoking. These public statements are false and misleading and have been made to further the 
Enterprise's overall objective of maximizing Defendants' profits from the sale of cigarettes.17
Defendants' fraudulent statements stem from their recognition, contained in internal documents written for decades, 
that new teenage smokers were essential to their continued profitability. See Findings of Fact Section V(F)(2). For 
example, a 1981 report conducted [*2370]  by the Philip Morris Research Center, titled ""Young Smokers 
Prevalence, Trends, Implications, and Related Demographic Trends,"" stated that ""Today's teenager is tomorrow's 
potential regular customer, and the overwhelming majority of smokers first begin to smoke while still in their teens. . 
. . The smoking patterns of teenagers are particularly important to Philip Morris."" 1000390803-0855 at 0808-0809

(US 22334). See also 501899346-9359 at 9351 (US 20688) (1974 internal R.J. Reynolds memorandum concluding 
that ""most smokers begin smoking regularly and select a usual brand at or before the age of 18""); 2041761791-
1801 at 1791, 1795 (US 21493) (1973 internal Philip Morris Memorandum titled ""Incidence of Smoking Cigarettes"" 
discussing a survey measuring smoking incidence among 12-17 year olds); 01110993-1032 at 1030 (US 20031) 
(1981 internal Lorillard document commenting that the company ""must continually keep in mind that Newport is 
being heavily supported by blacks and the under 18 smokers. We are on somewhat thin ice should either of these 
two groups decide to shift their smoking habits""); 680500903-1076 at 0930 (US 21607) (1974 B&W Five Year Plan 
for all of B&W brands stating ""the [*2371]  younger smokers' importance cannot be denied. They have distinct 
brand choices and association appears to exist between growth brands and segments, and the younger smoker""). 
Defendants not only recognized the importance of protecting their ability to market to youth, but acted in concert 
based on their shared interest.
Defendants aggressively pursued the youth market, often not distinguishing those under 18 from those under 21, 
while publicly denying their activities. For example, Tobacco Institute spokesperson Brennan Dawson appeared on 
television and provided statements to newspapers, making such assertions as, ""If a child never picks up another 
cigarette, it would be fine with the tobacco industry."" See, e.g., (no bates) (US 85153), (no bates) (US 85154). 
Indeed, many of the Racketeering Acts associated with Defendants' youth marketing consist of advertisements that 
appeal to and target youth, the designs of which are based on Defendants' research on teenage behaviors and 
preferences. See e.g., Racketeering Acts 76, 83, 84, 97, 102, 135-142, 147 and 148.
Simultaneously, Defendants made public assertions that they did not market to youth, that they viewed cigarette 
smoking as ""an adult [*2372]  custom,"" that they were committed to reducing youth smoking, and similar 
pronouncements. See Findings of Fact Section V(F)(7). These statements continue to the present day, appearing 
on Defendants' websites, in promotional materials, and in corporate principles. Similarly, Defendants continue to 
assert that their marketing has no effect on smoking prevalence and that they market only to current smokers in 
order to influence brand switching. See id.
Defendants argue that their fraudulent denials of marketing to youth have not actually served the goal of the 
Enterprise to preserve and enhance the cigarette market. However, the Court has already found that Defendants' 
fraudulent denials hid and protected their efforts to market to youth, efforts which are a substantial contributing 
factor to youth smoking initiation. See Findings of Fact Section V(F)(3). Defendants' efforts to target youth are 
based on a recognition that the youth market is critical to the growth of their industry; their denials of those efforts 
are based on the recognition that the public considers pursuit of the youth market to be ethically unacceptable.
In any event, it is immaterial to Defendants' liability whether [*2373]  they actually succeeded in their efforts to 
market to youth or to increase their revenues. As this Court has previously stated on numerous occasions, to 
establish RICO liability, the United States is not required to prove that Defendants succeeded in their scheme to 
defraud. United States v. Philip Morris, Inc., 273 F. Supp. 2d 3, 6 (D.D.C. 2002) (completion of scheme to defraud 
not required under federal fraud statutes); Philip Morris, 116 F. Supp. 2d 131, 153 (D.D.C. 2000) (""A defendant who 
uses the mail with the intent of defrauding someone of property is guilty (or in this case, liable), whether the attempt 
succeeds or not."") (emphasis in original).
Over many decades, Defendants have tracked the smoking behavior and brand preference of youth. At the same 
time Defendants were studying why youth start smoking, they were designing their marketing campaigns to appeal 
to the psychological needs of adolescents. See Findings of Fact Section V(F)(4) (discussing internal research 
examining what causes adolescents to smoke and whether their marketing effectively associates cigarette brands 
with youth-appealing themes and imagery). Defendants have also positioned their marketing to reach the maximum 
number of youth viewers. See Findings of Fact Section V(F)(5).
Defendants claim that the MSA fundamentally changed [*2374]  their marketing practices and prevents them from 
marketing to youth. While the Findings of Fact demonstrate that Defendants' practices have changed to some 
degree, their fundamental interest in recruiting new youth smokers, however, has not. Indeed, Defendants' 
marketing expenditures have increased substantially since signing the MSA. See Findings of Fact Section 
V(F)(5)(a). The 2005 Cigarette Report from the FTC shows that advertising and promotional spending increased by 
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118375, *2370

 
over 21% from 2002 to 2003, rising to a staggering $15.15 billion. FTC Cigarette Report for 2003 (2005) (available 
at http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2005/08/cigreport.htm). Spending on magazine advertising, including several magazines 
with substantial youth readership, increased by 46.4%, more than twice the increase in total advertising 
expenditures, from 2002 to 2003. Id. at 3.
Defendants have not abandoned or altered the youth-appealing themes and images they use in their marketing 
campaigns. Philip Morris continues to utilize the same Marlboro brand imagery, particularly the rugged, masculine 
Marlboro man, in its direct mail marketing, at point of sale, and on Marlboro cigarette packs, where it has been so 
phenomenally successful [*2375]  in the past. LeVan PD, U.S. v. Philip Morris, 6/25/02, 124:14-17, 221:10-221:14; 
Biglan TT, 1/10/05, 9530:6-9533:3. Lorillard has not changed the themes of its principal advertising campaign for its 
Newport Brand, the ""Pleasure"" campaign, which features attractive, vibrant young adults enjoying recreational 
activities and which has remained constant and successful for the past 30 years. Milstein TT, 1/10/05, 9312:1-
9314:9; 9417:18-9421:25; Orlowsky WD, 30:14-31:5. B&W continues to use youth-appealing imagery in the 
marketing campaigns for its Kool brand of cigarettes. Indeed, B&W received numerous complaints that its B Kool 
campaign, which ran from 1997 to 2000, appealed to adolescents. (no bates) (US 92037). R.J. Reynolds continues 
to target adolescents through its magazine advertising, which was appearing in Rolling Stone magazine at the 
same time its President, Lynn Beasley, testified in this case, under oath, that the company had ceased advertising 
in those publications. RJR has also recently launched cigarette brands in youth-appealing flavors such as Kauai 
Kolada and Twista Lime, which are clearly designed to target and entice youth. (no bates) (US 90119).
6. Defendants Falsely [*2376]  Denied that ETS Causes Disease
Exposure to secondhand smoke causes lung cancer in adults. Passive exposure causes two to three percent of all 
lung cancer cases in the United States. Compare DXA0390094-0699 at 0118, 0309 (US 88654) (1992 EPA Risk 
Assessment) (over 3,000 deaths annually) with Samet WD, 63:15-64:5 (155,000 lung cancer deaths from all causes 
in 2000) and DXA0390094-0699 at 218 (US 88654) (98,451 lung cancer deaths in 1979). Exposure to secondhand 
smoke can also cause coronary heart disease, exacerbation of asthma, reduced lung function, and respiratory 
symptoms in children. See generally Samet WD.18
Despite their internal acknowledgment of the hazards of secondhand smoke, Defendants have fraudulently denied 
that ETS causes disease. That public position and Defendants' efforts to deny and distort the scientific evidence of 
the harmfulness of ETS are evidenced not only in decades of press releases, reports, booklets, newsletters, 
television and radio appearances, and scientific symposia and publications, but in evidence of concerted, 
multifaceted public relations strategies designed to counter mainstream scientific publications. See Findings of Fact 
Section V(G)(6-8). For example, [*2377]  from January 1984 to April 1986, Reynolds ran a series of advertisements 
in newspapers across the country. One was titled ""Smoking in Public: Let's separate fact from fiction""; another was 
titled ""Secondhand smoke: Let's clear the air""; and a third ran under the headline ""Secondhand smoke: The Myth 
and the Reality."" The three Reynolds advertisements asserted: ""In fact, there is little evidence -- and certainly 
nothing which proves scientifically -- that cigarette smoke causes disease in nonsmokers."" 506290558-0792 at 
0608, 0611, 0612 (US 29799). In addition, in December 1986, the Tobacco Institute published a brochure titled 
""Tobacco Smoke and the Nonsmoker: Scientific Integrity at the Crossroads."" The Tobacco Institute claimed in its 
18 Although it is not in the record because it was issued this year, and accordingly, the Court does not rely upon it, the 2006 
Surgeon General Report, titled ""The Health and Consequences of Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco Smoke,"" contains 
noteworthy conclusions, which are entirely consistent with these Findings. In particular, the Surgeon General found ""there is no 
risk-free level of exposure to secondhand smoke."" Office on Smoking and Health, U.S. Dept. Of Health and Human Servs., The 
Health Consequences of Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco Smoke: A Report of the Surgeon Gen. — Executive Summary 9 
(2006). Exposure to secondhand smoke can increase the risk of a child being born at a low birth weight, increase the risk of 
sudden infant death syndrome, and cause acute respiratory infections and conditions in children as well as adults. Id. at 9, 11, 
12. Secondhand smoke also adversely affects the cardiovascular system, and causes coronary heart disease and lung cancer.

brochure that ""a detailed review of the scientific literature on ETS"" led to the conclusion that: ""The evidence does 
not support conclusions that ETS represents a health hazard to nonsmokers."" TIMN 284404-4413 at 4405 (US 
77088). Defendants' efforts continued even after the Surgeon General's seminal 1986 Report concluded that 
""involuntary smoking is a cause of disease, including lung cancer, in healthy nonsmokers."" VXA2110670-1053 at 
0673 (US 63709).
 [*2378] Defendants' efforts to deny and distort the disease risks of exposure to secondhand smoke, or ETS, 
spread to virtually every corner of the world. Beginning in the 1970s, Defendants crafted and carried out an ""open 
question"" strategy, derived from the public relations strategy they employed successfully to discredit research 
related to active smoking, to address the issue of passive smoking. They carried out this strategy through a 
comprehensive plan, and the expenditure of an extraordinary amount of money, to develop a worldwide network of 
consultants involved in a public relations offensive to undermine the growing scientific consensus that ETS causes 
lung cancer, as well as other serious diseases. These consultants attacked legitimate scientific investigation 
through:
• The identification and pre-selection of scientists touted as ""independent"" ETS consultants by Covington & 
Burling, particularly John Rupp, and Shook, Hardy & Bacon.
• The creation of supposedly ""independent"" scientific groups, such as Indoor Air International (""IAI"") and the 
Associates for Research on Indoor Air (""ARIA""), and even a scientific journal written by lawyers and industry 
consultants that exists to this day. [*2379] 
• The review, editing, and rewriting of consultants' papers and editorials by industry lawyers and scientists 
before publication.
• The planning and execution of numerous industry controlled symposia all over the world to generate 
favorable publications.
See generally Findings of Fact Section V(G)(6)(a)((6)).
Defendants justify the powerful public relations machinery they employed to attack the scientific evidence 
establishing ETS as a cause of disease by asserting that the evidence did not establish a link between exposure to 
secondhand smoke and diseases such as lung cancer and cardiovascular disease. However, the scientific 
community had reached a consensus on ETS as a cause of disease by 1986, as announced in the Surgeon 
General's Report. Moreover, and most significantly, Defendants themselves had determined by the 1970s that ETS 
was harmful to nonsmokers. See Findings of Fact Section V(G)(3).
Defendants still, to this day, fraudulently deny the health effects of ETS exposure. At trial, Philip Morris, BATCo, 
Brown &Williamson, Lorillard, and R.J. Reynolds denied that ETS causes disease in nonsmokers:
• RJR continues to publicly dispute that secondhand smoke causes diseases and other [*2380]  adverse health 
effects in nonsmokers. The company's position on its website indicates: ""Considering all of the evidence, in our 
opinion, it seems unlikely that secondhand smoke presents any significant harm to otherwise healthy 
nonsmoking adults."" US 9201). Mary Ward, an in-house attorney for RJR until 2004, testified that the RJR 
position on passive smoking has not changed since she joined the company in 1985, with the exception of 
admitting that ETS ""may trigger attacks in asthmatics."" Ward TT, 11/4/04, 5076:9-5077:22.
• Lorillard continues to dispute publicly the scientific consensus as well. Lorillard general counsel Ron Milstein 
testified that his company has never admitted in any forum that ETS exposure causes disease, and that an 
October 2003 press release containing one of his statements was in line with the company's position that ETS 
is not a proven health hazard. Milstein TT, 1/7/05, 9263:8-9264:24.
• B&W's most recent website tells the public that ETS is not harmful. The company's 2003 website stated: ""It is, 
therefore, our view that the scientific evidence is not sufficient to establish that environmental tobacco smoke is 
a cause of lung cancer, heart disease or other chronic [*2381]  diseases."" US 76761. B&W CEO Susan Ivey 
testified that her company places its positions on its website for consumers to rely on. Ivey TT, 11/16/04, 
6098:7-19.
• BATCo also denies that passive smoke is a health hazard to adults or children. (no bates) (US 86747).
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118375, *2377

 
• From 1999-2001, the Philip Morris website publicly stated its disagreement with the scientific consensus as 
well: ""Many scientists and regulators have concluded that ETS poses a health risk to nonsmokers. Even 
though we do not agree with many of their conclusions, below we have provided some links so you can access 
some of their views."" (no bates) (US 92056 at 2); Parrish TT, 1/25/05, 11080:23-11082:14.
• In contrast to its corporate position on active smoking, Philip Morris does not state its agreement with, or even 
acknowledge the existence of, the scientific consensus that passive smoking causes disease. (no bates) (US 
92055).
As they did with active smoking, using the Enterprise's public relations machinery, Defendants fraudulently denied 
the adverse health effects of ETS in order to maintain the appearance an open controversy about the link between 
ETS and disease and thus maintain and enhance the cigarette market and their [*2382]  collective revenues.
7. Defendants Suppressed Documents, Information, and Research
Throughout the past fifty years, Defendants have engaged in parallel efforts to suppress, conceal, and destroy 
documents and information in furtherance of the Enterprise's goals of (1) preventing the public from learning the 
truth about smoking's adverse impact on health; (2) preventing the public from learning the truth about the 
addictiveness of nicotine; and (3) avoiding or, at a minimum, limiting liability for smoking and health related claims in 
litigation. These activities occurred despite declarations by Defendants that (a) they did not conceal, suppress or 
destroy evidence, and that (b) they shared with the American people all pertinent information regarding the true 
health effects of smoking, including research findings related to smoking and health. See, e.g., Farone TT, 
10/12/04, 2091:23-2092:14; Farone WD, 156:3-15 (Philip Morris wanted to bury ""any research that was contrary to 
the company's position on smoking and health and addiction."").19
Defendants' suppression of information was aimed, in large part, at protecting them from exposure in smoking and 
health litigation. Indeed, much of the documentary [*2383]  and testimonial evidence directly references their fear of 
litigation exposure from scientific data and reports in their possession. The testimony of leading scientists from both 
Brown & Williamson and Philip Morris reflect Defendants' concerns over scientific information becoming available to 
plaintiffs in smoking and health litigation. Kendrick Wells, B&W Assistant General Counsel for Product Litigation, 
confirmed that throughout his 30-year tenure at B&W, the company feared that documents created by other BAT 
Group companies and statements made by employees of other BAT Group companies could adversely affect 
B&W's litigation position in the United States. Wells WD, 5:15-6:18. The concern over the use of information against 
the Defendants in litigation was also expressed in documents that chronicle the Defendants' cooperative efforts to 
suppress and conceal information. See e.g., (no bates) (US 21203) (memorandum in which outside counsel warned 
the Committee of Counsel that ""should the results of the survey prove unfavorable, they may be subpoenaed or 
otherwise fall into the hands of the FTC, a Congressional Committee, or a plaintiff in pending cancer litigation"").
In some instances, [*2384]  Defendants destroyed documents to prevent their release. See, e.g., (no bates) (US 
21677) (RJR scientists confirm they will remove documents from the research and development files if it becomes 
clear the documents will expose RJR in litigation); (no bates) (US 34839) (in notes of a BATCo meeting in 1986 it 
was reported that research documents would be destroyed as part of ""spring cleaning""). Defendants also employed 
lawyers to review and edit scientific documents to ensure that no damaging information was retained in company 
files. See, e.g., Findings of Fact Section V(H)(1). In addition, certain Defendants, including Philip Morris and Brown 
& Williamson, made arrangements to ship secret scientific information outside of the United States or to use foreign 
scientific laboratories to shield documents from disclosure in litigation. For example, Philip Morris bought a foreign 
research facility in Germany known as INBIFO and established company policies to prevent its research documents 
from entering or being retained in the United States. Farone WD, 21:16-22:9, 147:11-152:15; Farone TT, 10/07/04, 
1938:2-1939:16. Defendants attempted to create attorney-client privilege where none properly [*2385]  existed. See 
Findings of Fact Section V(H)(3).
19 The alleged Racketeering Acts relating to this claimed scheme are Racketeering Act Nos. 11, 19, 20, 21, 28, 41, 58, 63, 71, 
72, 74, 75, 103 and 108.
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118375, *2381

 
Many of the actions to suppress information were joint efforts by all of the Defendants through the Committee of 
Counsel, through other joint organizations, or through Defendants' law firms, including Covington & Burling and 
Shook, Hardy & Bacon, which often represented one or more of the Defendants.
C. Defendants Established an Enterprise
1. Applicable Legal Standards
Defendants formed a RICO Enterprise, comprised of a group of business entities and individuals associated-in-fact, 
including Defendants to this action, their agents and employees, and other organizations and individuals.
The RICO statute provides that an ""'enterprise' includes any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or 
other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity."" 18 U.S.C. § 
1961(4). The Supreme Court has held that an enterprise ""is proved by evidence of an ongoing organization, formal 
or informal, and by evidence that the various associates function as a continuing unit."" United States v. Turkette, 
452 U.S. 576, 583, 101 S. Ct. 2524, 69 L. Ed. 2d 246 (1981). In accordance with Turkette, the Court of Appeals for 
this Circuit has consistently held that an association-in-fact ""enterprise is established by [*2386]  (1) a common 
purpose among the participants, (2) organization, and (3) continuity,"" and that the enterprise need only involve 
""some structure, to distinguish an enterprise from a mere conspiracy."" United States v. Richardson, 167 F.3d 621, 
625, 334 U.S. App. D.C. 384 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (citations omitted); accord United States v. White, 116 F.3d 903, 924, 
325 U.S. App. D.C. 282 & 925 n.7 (D.C. Cir. 1997); United States v. Perholtz, 842 F.2d 343, 362-63, 268 U.S. App. 
D.C. 347 (D.C. Cir. 1988). As our Circuit further explained: ""It is not necessary that the enterprise . . . have any 
particular or formal structure but it must have sufficient organization that its members function and operated 
together in a coordinated manner in order to carry out the common purpose alleged."" Perholtz, 842 F.2d at 364.
Establishing that the members of the enterprise operated together in a coordinated manner in furtherance of a 
common purpose may be proven by a wide variety of direct and circumstantial evidence including, but not limited to: 
inferences from the members' commission of similar racketeering acts in furtherance of a shared objective; financial 
ties; coordination of activities; a community of interests and objectives; the interlocking nature of the members' 
schemes; and the overlapping nature of the wrongful conduct. See, e.g., United States v. Owens, 167 F.3d 739, 
751 (1st Cir. 1999) (members of drug trafficking enterprise provided other members with financial assistance and 
coordinated transportation of drugs); Richardson, 167 F.3d at 625 (""Additional evidence [*2387]  of [the 
enterprise's] organization and continuity comes from the robberies' consistent pattern.""); United States v. Davidson, 
122 F.3d 531, 535 (8th Cir. 1997); Perholtz, 842 F.2d at 355 (""The interlocking nature of the schemes and the 
overlapping nature of the wrongdoing provides sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that this was a single 
enterprise.""); United States v. Qaoud, 777 F.2d 1105, 1116-17 (6th Cir. 1985) (jury could have inferred the 
existence of the alleged association-in-fact enterprise from the ""coordinated nature of the defendants' activity"" and 
that the defendants' racketeering acts were facilitated by their nexus to the enterprise); United States v. Griffin, 660 
F.2d 996, 1000 (4th Cir. 1981); United States v. Elliott, 571 F.2d 880, 898 (5th Cir. 1978) (jury entitled to infer 
existence of enterprise from circumstantial evidence).
""It is not essential that each and every person named [as a member of the enterprise] be proven to be a part of the 
enterprise. The enterprise may exist even if its membership changes over time . . . or if certain defendants are 
found by the [fact finder] not to have been members at any time."" Perholtz, 842 F.2d at 364. Likewise, it is not 
necessary to prove ""that every member of the enterprise participated in or knew about all its activities."" United 
States v. Cagnina, 697 F.2d 915, 922 (11th Cir. 1983); see also United States v. Rastelli, 870 F.2d 822, 827-28 (2d 
Cir. 1989).
This Court has already held, consistent with the law of this Circuit, that a RICO enterprise may consist of ""a group 
of individual[s], partnerships, and corporations [*2388]  associated in fact,"" United States v. Philip Morris Inc., 116 
F. Supp. 2d at 152 (quoting Perholtz, 842 F.2d at 351, n.12). In Perholtz itself, the D.C. Circuit held that RICO's 
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118375, *2385

 
definition of ""enterprise"" includes an association-in-fact of corporations, legal entities and individuals. 842 F.2d at 
352-53.
2. Defendants' Enterprise Had a Common Purpose
The central shared objective of Defendants has been to maximize the profits of the cigarette company Defendants 
by acting in concert to preserve and enhance the market for cigarettes through an overarching scheme to defraud 
existing and potential smokers. Indeed, documents recounting the December 1953 meeting at the Plaza Hotel 
attended by the presidents of Defendants Philip Morris, RJR, B&W, Lorillard, and American -- a meeting called by 
American's president to discuss an ""industry response"" to research identifying cigarette smoking as a cause of lung 
cancer -- report that the executives agreed to jointly
sponsor a public relations campaign which is positive in nature and is entirely ""pro-cigarettes. . . ."" [The 
executives] are also emphatic in saying that the entire activity is a long-term, continuing program, since they 
feel that the problem is one of promoting cigarettes and protecting them from these and other attacks that may 
be expected [*2389]  in the future. Each of the company presidents attending emphasized the fact that they 
consider the program to be a long-term one.
MTP0023548-3552 at 3549 (US 21411). See also Findings of Fact Section III(B). Defendants recognized that their 
competing companies would benefit from working together on certain common problems while continuing to 
compete against each other for the largest share of the cigarette market.
Over the next several decades, the common goal of preserving and enhancing the cigarette market, maximizing 
profits, avoiding costly liability judgments, and deterring or minimizing attempts to make smoking socially 
unacceptable remained central to the actions of Defendants. During that time, Defendants uniformly denied, both 
individually and collectively: that smoking had been proven as a cause of cancer and other serious diseases (while 
falsely promising that the industry was funding independent research to determine the health effects of smoking); 
that secondhand smoke caused disease; that smoking was addictive; that the industry manipulated the levels of 
nicotine in its products; that light and low tar cigarettes were no less hazardous than full flavor cigarettes; and 
that [*2390]  the industry marketed its products to young people.
The United States has shown that the Defendant members of the Enterprise who were not physically present at the 
Plaza Hotel meeting -- including Liggett, Altria (which was formed in 1985 and had previously been known as Philip 
Morris Companies), BATCo, CTR (which was first created as the Tobacco Industry Research Committee in the 
wake of the December 1953 meeting), and the Tobacco Institute (which was formed in 1958) -- also shared the 
common goals of the Enterprise and acted in furtherance of those goals. See Findings of Fact Section III. Moreover, 
in furtherance of the central objectives of the Enterprise, Defendants attempted to, and at times did, conceal or 
suppress information and destroy documents. Their purpose in taking such action was to avoid adverse liability 
judgments in litigation involving smoking and health issues and to prevent discovery of evidence regarding the 
causal link between cigarettes, addiction, and disease. See Findings of Fact Section V(H).
3. The Enterprise operated through both formal and informal organization
Like an amoeba, the organization of the Enterprise changed its shape to fit its current needs, [*2391]  adding 
organizations when necessary and eliminating them when they became obsolete. Whatever the shape or 
composition of the Enterprise at any given time, again like an amoeba, its core purpose remained constant: survival 
of the industry. The participants in the Enterprise coordinated and strategized in order to preserve and enhance the 
cigarette market and, in turn, their individual revenues. The Enterprise created and used formal and informal 
entities, many with overlapping participants and purposes, to serve Defendants' central mission.
For example, in terms of formal organization, TIRC/CTR and the Tobacco Institute were jointly formed and funded 
by other Defendant-members of the Enterprise to help the industry execute the strategy devised to achieve their 
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118375, *2388

 
shared goal. TIRC/CTR sponsored and funded research that attacked scientific studies demonstrating the harmful 
effects of smoking cigarettes but did not itself conduct research addressing the fundamental questions regarding 
the adverse health effects of smoking. Moreover, attorneys for Defendants initiated and oversaw CTR ""Special 
Projects"" --research projects conceived and directed by industry representatives, including industry [*2392]  
lawyers, to support scientists who had shown a willingness and ability to generate data, and provide testimony, that 
would bolster the industry's litigation position before courts and governmental bodies. See Findings of Fact Section 
III(E)(2). Altria executives served on the Board of Directors of CTR, and Altria had, and exercised, approval 
authority for CTR special projects. See, e.g., Parrish TT, 1/27/05, 11349:8-11352:23, 11355:1-11357:8; (no bates) 
US 87508; (no bates) US 20384.
Similarly, from 1958 to 1998, the Tobacco Institute actively designed, wrote, and caused to be published press 
releases, advertisements, pamphlets, and testimony that advanced Defendants' jointly-formulated positions on 
smoking and health issues, including denying that smoking cigarettes caused disease and was addictive, and 
supported the false claim that the link between smoking cigarettes and exposure to secondhand smoke and 
adverse health effects was an ""open question."" See Findings of Fact Section III(D)(3). The Tobacco Institute served 
as an effective conduit of information between members of the Enterprise both domestically and internationally 
through its various committees. See Findings of Fact Section [*2393]  III(D)(4). Altria executives attended meetings 
of the TI Committee of Counsel and sat on the TI Executive Committee. Parrish TT, 1/27/05, 11352:24-11353:24; 
(no bates) (US 62461); (no bates) (US 88252); (no bates) (US 88308).
Defendants also used numerous other means -- including structures of varying degrees of formality such as CIAR, 
the Committee of Counsel, the ETS Advisory Committee, the Ad Hoc Committee, the Research Liaison Committee, 
the Industry Technical Committee, law firms20 , and direct communications between and among members of the 
Enterprise -- to coordinate their activities, ensure continued adherence to the joint strategy, and enable the 
Enterprise to respond as new threats to the industry arose. See Findings of Fact Section III(F).
Defendants' claim that the Enterprise no longer has any organization within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) 
because all of the ""all of the organizational vehicles for the 'enterprise' no longer exist"" is unpersuasive. Defs.' 
Corrected Trial Brief at 29. While it is true that CTR and TI were dissolved pursuant to the terms of the MSA, all of 
the other organizations either still exist or can be readily re-activated. Moreover, the individuals and Defendant-
companies [*2394]  participating in these organizations, who, incidentally, often overlapped, still exist. Most 
importantly, Defendants have an ongoing need to satisfy the same purposes which these organizations met. Put 
simply, these organizations can be resurrected, recreated, or reincarnated at any time as Defendants wish. For 
example, Philip Morris currently has PMERP (Philip Morris External Research Program) which operates out of 
CIAR's former headquarters, is directed by CIAR's former scientific director, Max Eisenberg, and continues to fund 
many former CIAR projects.
4. The Enterprise Has Functioned as a Continuous Unit
The evidence also convincingly demonstrates that the Enterprise has functioned as a continuous unit from at least 
December 1953,21 when the executives of five Defendants (Philip Morris, RJR, B&W, Lorillard and American) 
agreed to launch their long-term campaign to deceive and mislead American smokers and potential smokers 
announced in the Frank Statement. See Findings of Fact Section III(B). For five decades, Defendants not only 
communicated directly and continuously with one another on matters relevant to the aims of the Enterprise, but also 
created, supported, and controlled a web [*2395]  of organizations, committees, and other bodies that facilitated 
coordinated behavior. For example, TIRC/CTR, which was created in 1954, existed until 1998, and the Tobacco 
Institute, which was created in 1958, existed until 2000. Jointly created and funded CIAR, which was created in 
20 Despite the apparent conflict of interest, a few law firms, particularly Covington & Burling and Shook, Hardy & Bacon, 
represented the shared interests of all the Defendants and coordinated a significant part of the Enterprise's activities.
21 For purposes of this lawsuit, the Enterprise was in existence as early as December 1953. No evidence was presented about 
the Enterprise prior to 1953.
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118375, *2391

 
1988, existed through 1999. In addition, Defendants' participation in various other organizations, including many 
international organizations, continued for years. Defendants continue to participate in the TAC (formerly the TSMC 
and then the TRC) even today. Similarly, Defendants continue to participate in CORESTA, and the TDC (formerly 
ICOSI and then INFOTAB). See Findings of Fact Section III(I).
Over many years, Defendants, often used the Tobacco Institute to furnish advice, assistance, and even financial 
support to international industry-related groups and organizations as they worked on projects, publications, videos, 
conferences, briefing papers, and lobbying materials for the benefit of the Enterprise. See Findings of Fact Section 
III(D). For example, the Tobacco Institute funded and organized the College of Tobacco Knowledge, a series of 
annual seminars for employees of the tobacco industry and tobacco-related [*2396]  industries which addressed 
issues facing the industry at that time and sought to ensure presentation of a unified and consistent public stance 
on smoking and health issues. See Findings of Fact Section III(D)(5). Defendants utilized their outside lawyers to 
further the goals of the Enterprise, including attorneys such as John Rupp at Covington & Burling, Donald Hoel at 
Shook, Hardy & Bacon, Andrew Foyle at Lovells, and others at Chadbourne & Parke and Jones Day.
Finally, Defendants have continued to adhere to many of the exact positions formulated at the very genesis of the 
Enterprise -- such as denial of the adverse health effects of smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke, denial of 
the addictive properties of nicotine, and denial that Defendants market to youth. See Findings of Fact Section 
V(A,B,F,G).
In sum, the Enterprise consisted of individual Defendants working together to coordinate significant activities for 
over 50 years through TIRC/CTR, the Tobacco Institute, and an array of other overlapping entities. Their activities 
were calculated to serve their shared objectives, including their primary goal of maximizing profits by preserving and 
expanding the market for cigarettes. [*2397]  See, e.g., United Healthcare Corp. v. Am. Trade Ins. Co., 88 F.3d 
563, 570 (8th Cir. 1996); Securitron Magnalock Corp., 65 F.3d at 263-64; Perholtz, 842 F.2d at 355; Local 1804-1, 
812 F. Supp. at 1310-15; Mitland Raleigh-Durham v. Myers, 807 F. Supp. 1025, 1055 (S.D.N.Y. 1992).
D. The Enterprise Engaged in and Its Activities Affected Interstate and Foreign Commerce
There can simply be no denying that the Enterprise engaged in, and its activities affected, interstate or foreign 
commerce. This has been proven, in part, by the fact that each individual Defendant itself had an extensive nexus 
to interstate or foreign commerce. See, e.g., United States v. Farmer, 924 F.2d 647, 651 (7th Cir. 1991); United 
States v. Norton, 867 F.2d 1354, 1359 (11th Cir. 1989) (collecting cases); United States v. Doherty, 867 F.2d 47, 68 
(1st Cir. 1989); United States v. Bagnariol, 665 F.2d 877, 892-93 (9th Cir. 1981); United States v. Long, 651 F.2d 
239, 241-42 (4th Cir. 1981); United States v. Stratton, 649 F.2d 1066, 1075 (5th Cir. 1981).
In fact, each of the cigarette company Defendants stipulated that from 1953 to the present it has been engaged in, 
and its activities affect, interstate and foreign commerce within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) and (d). 
Similarly, Altria stipulated that it has engaged in interstate and foreign commerce since it was formed as Philip 
Morris Companies in 1985. See Order #280.
Between 1954 and 1998, Defendants CTR and TI (beginning in 1958), both incorporated in New York state, each 
received over $500 million in funding in interstate commerce via the interstate banking system from various 
cigarette company Defendants located in different states. See Findings of Fact Section IV(I,J). During that same 
time period, CTR funded millions of dollars of research projects, which were conducted [*2398]  by researchers and 
institutions in various states and abroad, the results of which were published in periodicals and books throughout 
the United States and in foreign countries. Similarly, TI issued thousands of press releases and public relations 
advertisements which were disseminated in interstate commerce throughout the United States in various 
newspapers, magazines, periodicals and books. See Findings of Fact Section III(C,D). Thus, CTR and TI were 
engaged in and their activities affected interstate commerce.
Because many of BATCo's Racketeering Acts took place outside the United States, Defendants claim that they 
cannot be the basis of RICO violations. RICO may apply to conduct which occurs outside the United States as long 
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118375, *2395

 
as it has a substantial direct effect on the United States. Doe I v. Unocal, 395 F.3d 932 (9th Cir. 2002). RICO is an 
expansive statute, broadly construed to reach a wide array of activity. United States v. Pepe, 747 F.2d 632 (11th 
Cir. 1984). Generally, courts have concluded that this broad construction does not include international schemes 
largely unrelated to the United States. See e.g., Brink's Mat Limited v. Diamond, 906 F.2d 1519, 1524 (11th Cir. 
1990) . In determining whether RICO applies extraterritorially, allegations must meet either the ""conduct"" test or the 
""effects"" test. Under the ""conduct"" test, RICO applies [*2399]  where the conduct within the United States directly 
caused a foreign injury. North South Fin. Corp. v. Al-Turki, 100 F.3d 1051 (2 Cir. 1996). Under the ""effects"" test, 
RICO applies when the foreign conduct at issue has ""substantial"" effects within the United States. Consolidated 
Gold Fields PLC v. Minorco, S.A., 871 F.2d 252, 261-62 (2nd Cir. 1989). This test is met when the domestic effect 
is a ""direct and foreseeable result of the conduct outside of the United States."" Id. at 262. At all times, the primary 
consideration is whether the scheme to defraud or artifice has a tangential or direct effect on the United States. See 
e.g., Butte Min. PLC v. Smith, 876 F. Supp. 1153 (D. Mont. 1995); United States v. Noriega, 746 F. Supp. 1506, 
1516-1517 (S.D. Fla. 1990); Consolidated Gold Fields PLC v. Minorco S.A., 871 F.2d 252, 261-62 (2d Cir.1989).
While it is true that many of BATCo's activities and statements took place outside of the United States, they 
nevertheless had substantial direct effects on the United States. First, many of BATCo's statements and policies at 
issue in this case concerned US subsidiary/affiliate Brown & Williamson and potential litigation in the United States. 
Second, and most importantly, BATCo's activities and statements furthered the Enterprise's overall scheme to 
defraud, which had a tremendous impact on the United States, as demonstrated in the Findings of Fact.
Finally, the evidence that all Defendants taken together have bought and sold literally over one trillion dollars of 
goods and services in interstate [*2400]  and foreign commerce since 1954 conclusively establishes the requisite 
effect on interstate commerce.
E. Each Defendant Was Associated with, but Distinct from, the Enterprise
1. Each Defendant Is Associated with the Enterprise
To prove a defendant's association with an association-in-fact enterprise, it is not necessary to prove that the 
defendant had a formal position in the enterprise, participated in all the activities of the enterprise, ""had full 
knowledge of all the details of"" its activities, or even knew about the participation of all the other members in the 
enterprise. Rather, it is sufficient that the defendant ""know the general nature of the enterprise and know that the 
enterprise extends beyond his individual role."" United States v. Rastelli, 870 F.2d 822, 828 (2d Cir. 1989) (collecting 
cases); see also United States v. Marino, 277 F.3d 11, 33 (1st Cir. 2002) (""Association may be by means of an 
informal or loose relationship. To associate has its plain meaning. . . . 'Associated' means to be joined, often in a 
loose relationship, as a partner, fellow worker, colleague, friend, companion or ally. Thus, although a person's role 
in the enterprise may be very minor, a person will still be associated with the enterprise if he knowingly joins with a 
group of individuals associated in fact who [*2401]  constitute the enterprise.""); United States v. Zichetello, 208 F.3d 
72, 99 (2d Cir. 2000); United States v. Tocco, 200 F.3d 401, 425 (6th Cir. 2000); United States v. Console, 13 F.3d 
641, 653 (3d Cir. 1993); United States v. Martino, 648 F.2d 367, 394 (5th Cir. 1981).
Moreover, ""[a] defendant is considered to have 'associated with' a RICO enterprise if he engages in the predicate 
act violations with other members of the enterprise, even if he is not an actual 'insider' of the enterprise,"" Blue Cross 
& Blue Shield of N.J., Inc. v, Philip Morris, Inc.,113 F. Supp. 2d 345, 366 (E.D.N.Y. 2000), or otherwise commits 
racketeering acts in the conduct of the enterprise's affairs. See, e.g., United States v. Watchmaker, 761 F.2d 1459, 
1476 (11th Cir. 1985); United States v. Swiderski, 593 F.2d 1246, 1248-49, 193 U.S. App. D.C. 92 (D.C. Cir. 1978). 
In addition, a defendant ""associates with"" an enterprise when he conducts business with or through the enterprise, 
or otherwise has an effect on its activities, including its unlawful activities. United States v. Mokol, 957 F.2d 1410, 
1417 (7th Cir. 1992).
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118375, *2398

 
The extensive Findings of Fact establish that not only did each Defendant know the general nature and purpose of 
the Enterprise, and that it extended beyond any one Defendant's individual role, but each Defendant also knew that 
all the other Defendants were participating in the Enterprise to achieve their shared objective. Defendants formed 
numerous entities -- both formal and informal -- to achieve their shared objective, as summarized above and set 
forth in great detail in the Findings of Fact. For example, decades after they had internally recognized that smoking 
caused disease, all Defendants publicly maintained that the link between [*2402]  smoking and disease remained 
an ""open question."" See Findings of Fact Section V(A)(5)(c).
Defendants Liggett and Altria were also associated with the Enterprise. Liggett shared and supported the common 
objectives of TIRC/CTR with the other Defendants. See generally Findings of Fact Section III. Defendant Altria also 
shared and supported the common objective of CTR. Altria employees not only knew about the activities of CTR, 
but were involved in them as well, attending CTR Board of Director meetings and CTR Annual Member meetings 
and participating in the approval and funding decisions related to CTR Special Projects. Pollice WD, 6:1-12:12; 
Pollice TT, 10/04/04, 1526:22-1527:14, 1528:19-1529:1. See Findings of Fact Section III(C). Similarly, Defendant 
BATCo shared and supported the common objectives of TIRC/CTR. Communications and contact between high 
level smoking and health research scientists at BATCo and scientists affiliated with TIRC/CTR were frequent and 
direct. TIRC/CTR employees also traveled to England to attend meetings with BATCo employees and other 
members of international tobacco organizations. BATCo was a critical participant in worldwide efforts to deny or 
distort the [*2403]  health risks of ETS exposure, though organizations such as IEMC, INFOTAB, CORESTA, the 
Verband der Cigaretteindustrie (VdC) (the German trade association of cigarette manufacturers including German 
and Austrian manufacturers as well as Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds, and BATCo), and others, and its participation 
included coordination with CIAR. See Findings of Fact Section III(I).
Throughout the life of the Enterprise, Defendants have coordinated their fraudulent activities through other formal 
entities, such as TI, CTR, CIAR, and ICOSI as well. See Findings of Fact Section III (C, D, H, I). In addition, 
Defendants' use of informal organizations such as the Ad Hoc Committee (which was comprised of tobacco 
industry lawyers and advised Defendants on matters affecting the tobacco industry), the Research Liaison 
Committee (which was also comprised of lawyers who reviewed, directed and coordinated joint research activity by 
Defendants), the ETS Advisory Committee (which dealt with issues related to environmental tobacco smoke and led 
to the formation of CIAR), and the Industry Technical Committee (which was comprised of the scientific directors of 
the cigarette company Defendants and assisted [*2404]  TIRC/CTR on technical issues related to cigarette design 
and other matters), allowed the Enterprise to direct the conduct of its members by providing mechanisms for quickly 
responding to areas of common concern and develop coordinated strategies for responding to them. See Findings 
of Fact Sections III(F) and V(G)(a).
The documentary and testimonial evidence of direct communications among Defendants --phone calls, meetings, 
and correspondence at the highest levels of their respective corporate, scientific, and legal hierarchies -- is 
overwhelming. This evidence establishes that each Defendant knew that (and in innumerable instances, knew how) 
other Defendants were acting to further the common purpose of the Enterprise. See generally Findings of Fact. 
Moreover, all Defendants maintained their association with all the formal and informal activities comprising the 
Enterprise through periodic meetings, scientific symposia, correspondence and conversations regarding, inter alia, 
research projects, public statements, and advertising. Again, all these efforts were designed to advance the primary 
objective of the Enterprise: to maximize profits by acting in concert to preserve and enhance the [*2405]  market for 
cigarettes, to avoid legal liability that could result in large damage awards and increase public recognition of the 
harmful effects of smoking and its addictiveness, and to deflect efforts to make smoking socially unacceptable. In 
addition, as discussed in Section VII(G)(3)(a), infra, all of the Defendants committed racketeering acts in 
furtherance of the shared objectives of the Enterprise.
Thus, each Defendant has been proven to be associated with the Enterprise and its ongoing activities.
2. Each Defendant is Distinct from the Enterprise
This Court has already held:
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118375, *2401

 
Regardless of how the enterprise is defined (if at all), the Government has proven the distinctness element in 
this case. This Court has already held that an ""association-in-fact"" enterprise can be a group of corporations. 
See Philip Morris, 116 F. Supp. 2d at 152-53. Moreover, there is no dispute that each individual Defendant is a 
separate legal entity. Thus, if this Court should find an enterprise comprised of at least two of the Defendants, 
the individual Defendants will be distinct from the enterprise itself.
United States v. Philip Morris USA, 327 F. Supp. 2d 13, 18 (D.D.C. 2004).
F. Each Defendant Participated in the Conduct of the Enterprise
Section 1962(c) requires proof that each defendant ""conduct[ed] or participate[d], directly [*2406]  or indirectly, in 
the conduct of [the] enterprise's affairs."" Addressing this element, the Supreme Court held that a defendant is not 
liable for a substantive RICO violation under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) unless the defendant ""participate[s] in the 
operation or management of the enterprise itself."" Reves v. Ernst & Young, 507 U.S. 170, 185, 113 S. Ct. 1163, 122 
L. Ed. 2d 525 (1993). The Court explained:
Once we understand the word ""conduct"" to require some degree of direction and the word ""participate"" to 
require some part in that direction, the meaning of § 1962(c) comes into focus. In order to ""participate, directly 
or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs,"" one must have some part in directing those affairs.
Id. at 179. A defendant may satisfy this test even if he did not have significant control over the enterprise's affairs. 
As the Court pointed out in Reves, ""RICO liability is not limited to those with primary responsibility for the 
enterprise's affairs"" and it specifically ""disagree[d] with the suggestion of the Court of Appeals for the District of 
Columbia Circuit that § 1962(c) requires 'significant control over or within an enterprise.'"" Id. at 179 & n.4 (quoting 
Yellow Bus Lines, Inc. v. Drivers, Chauffeurs & Helpers Local Union 639, 913 F.2d 948, 954, 286 U.S. App. D.C. 
182 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (en banc) (emphasis in Reves)).
The Supreme Court recognized that:
We agree that liability under § 1962(c) is not limited to upper management, but we [*2407]  disagree that the 
""operation or management"" test is inconsistent with this proposition. An enterprise is ""operated"" not just by 
upper management but also by lower rung participants in the enterprise who are under the direction of upper 
management. An enterprise also might be ""operated"" or ""managed"" by others ""associated with"" the enterprise 
who exert control over it as, for example, by bribery.
Id. at 184.
Following Reves, the federal courts of appeals have made it clear that a defendant need not be among the 
enterprise's ""control group"" in order to be held liable for a substantive RICO violation; rather, a defendant need only 
intentionally perform acts that are related to, and further, its operation or management. As the First Circuit 
explained: ""The terms 'conduct' and 'participate' in the conduct of the affairs of the enterprise include the intentional 
and deliberate performance of acts, functions, or duties which are related to the operation or management of the 
enterprise."" United States v. Weiner, 3 F.3d 17, 24 (1st Cir. 1993) (quoting Reves). Numerous courts have held that 
Reves is satisfied by evidence that lower-rung members of an enterprise implemented decisions directed by those 
higher up the ladder in the enterprise or committed racketeering [*2408]  acts which furthered the basic goals of the 
enterprise at the direction of other members of the enterprise. See, e.g., United States v. Parise, 159 F.3d 790, 796 
(3d Cir. 1998); United States v. Shifman, 124 F.3d 31, 35-36 (1st Cir. 1997); United States v. Starrett, 55 F.3d 1525, 
1548 (11th Cir. 1995).
In this case, high-level employees of each Defendant not only participated in the operation and management of the 
Enterprise, but also each Defendant, acting through these employees, played a significant role in making and 
implementing decisions in furtherance of the Enterprise's activities and purposes. See generally Findings of Fact.
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118375, *2405

 
For example, the member companies, as well as the Tobacco Institute and Altria, participated in the Committee of 
Counsel to further the Enterprise's objective. The Committee of Counsel made key decisions regarding the 
Enterprise's activities in many areas including, but not limited to, joint research, litigation defense and public 
relations. See Findings of Fact Section III(D)(4)(a). In a presentation to the Committee of Counsel in the early 
1980s, Ernest Pepples, B&W General Counsel, reported that ""[t]he products liability environment is growing more 
hostile with dramatic speed. . . . A mistake -- any concession -- by a defendant will be costly."" Complaining of 
certain health claims in a Philip Morris advertisement that suggested [*2409]  that certain cigarettes were unsafe, 
Pepples noted that:
The frightening mathematics of smoking and health products liability actions is that a verdict against one 
company will soon result in verdicts against the others. Consequently, the primary function of this Committee of 
Counsel has been to circle the wagons, to coordinate not only the defense of active cases, but also to 
coordinate the advice which the General Counsels give to ongoing operations of their companies pertaining to 
products liability risks.
(no bates) (US 20874).
In addition, each Defendant had some part in directing the affairs of the Enterprise by coordinating and causing the 
public dissemination of false, misleading or deceptive statements denying the link between smoking cigarettes and 
adverse health effects, denying the addictiveness of smoking, and by committing related racketeering acts, all in 
furtherance of the primary, shared objective of the Enterprise. See Findings of Fact V(A, B).
Defendant Altria (f/k/a Philip Morris Companies) argues that, as a parent company to Philip Morris, it did not 
participate in the affairs of the Enterprise. The Court concludes, however, that Altria did participate in the 
Enterprise [*2410]  both directly, by joining many of the Enterprise's organizations and by supporting its objective, 
and indirectly, by controlling the policies and public positions of Philip Morris, the only subsidiary of Altria which 
manufactures cigarettes. Altria participated directly in the operation and management of the Enterprise through, for 
example, the Scientific Research Review Committee (""SRRC""), which had responsibility for overseeing ""all scientific 
studies, related to tobacco, smoke and/or smoking, conducted or funded by Philip Morris Companies or any of its 
subsidiaries around the world"" with authority to review and approve all funding of scientific studies related to those 
topics. SRRC was represented on the following entities which conducted jointly-funded research with other tobacco 
companies: CIAR; VDC; Association Suisse des Fabricants de Cigarettes; Centre de Cooperation pour Les 
Rechereches Scientifiques Relatives au Tabac — CORESTA (France); Tobacco Manufacturing Association (TMA), 
formerly Tobacco Advisory Council (TAC) and Tobacco Research Council (TRC) (UK); and Australian Cigarette 
Association. Reif PD, U.S. v. Philip Morris, 7/30/03, 49:1-49:12. After the MSA-mandated dissolution [*2411]  of 
CTR and CIAR, the SRRC continued to approve research projects funded by Philip Morris through its ""External 
Research Program"" which was created in 2000 to take over the function of funding third-party research and 
eventually took the place of the SRRC. Id. at 194:15-195:13.
Altria also conducted and participated in the conduct of the Enterprise by controlling the positions of Defendant 
Philip Morris USA. Although Philip Morris has its own communications department, Altria controls its 
communications on sensitive issues such as litigation against Philip Morris, Philip Morris's opposition to federal 
excise taxes on cigarettes, and Philip Morris's support for FDA regulation of tobacco products -- even when those 
issues affect Philip Morris alone among Altria's many subsidiary companies. John Hoel PD, U.S. v. Philip Morris, 
5/30/03, 60:12-63:7, 67:3-22, 166:17-167:14; see also (no bates) (US 44422) (1999 memo from Philip Morris 
Companies to Philip Morris outlining the company's position and strategy on a proposed federal excise tax increase 
for cigarettes); US 45675 (2001 memo outlining Philip Morris' position on FDA regulation of cigarettes). As another 
example, Altria, through its [*2412]  subsidiaries, controls the use of the Marlboro trademark both in the United 
States and abroad. Myers TT, 5/19/05, 21719:8-21720:13. Altria also established Worldwide Scientific Affairs 
(""WSA""), an internal working group which coordinates scientific research and science policy, including smoking and 
health issues, across all of the Altria companies. WSA was organized in regions covering various operating 
company subsidiaries, including Philip Morris, Philip Morris International, and their subsidiaries, in various parts of 
the world; scientific policy of Altria subsidiaries was coordinated across these regions in which subsidiaries did 
business. Reif PD, U.S.. v. Philip Morris, 3/30/04, 316:17-318:7; (no bates) (US 89153); (no bates) (US 89155). 
Altria also established a department of Worldwide Regulatory Affairs (WRA), to coordinate and ensure consistency 
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118375, *2408

 
in regulatory policy statements and responses across all of the Altria companies. See, e.g., Keane TT, 1/19/05, 
10484:19-10489:3; (no bates) (US 41574); Reif PD, U.S. v. Philip Morris, 3/30/04, 344:14-345:11.22
In addition, the volume and frequency of correspondence between and among Defendants, and the consistent 
participation of their [*2413]  representatives in regular meetings, demonstrates the degree to which all Defendants 
directed and coordinated activities in furtherance of the affairs of the Enterprise. See generally Findings of Fact 
Sections III and V(G). Similarly, most Defendants endeavored to conceal or suppress information and documents 
and/or to destroy records which may have been detrimental to the interests of the members of the Enterprise, 
including information which could be discoverable in tobacco and health-related liability cases against Defendants, 
and provide evidence of the link between smoking cigarettes and adverse health consequences and addictiveness. 
See Findings of Fact Section V(H).
Accordingly, the evidence establishes that each Defendant participated, directly and indirectly, in the conduct of the 
Enterprise. Reves, at 179.
G. Each Defendant Carried Out Its Participation in the Conduct of the Enterprise by Engaging in a Pattern of 
Racketeering Activity
1. The Government Has Proven that Defendants Caused Mailings and Wire Transmissions, in Furtherance 
of the Scheme to Defraud, in Violation of 18 U.S.C. § § 1341 and/or 1343
The Supreme Court has ruled that one ""'causes' the mails to be used"" when ""one does an act with knowledge 
that [*2414]  the use of the mails will follow in the ordinary course of business, or where such use can reasonably 
be foreseen, even though not actually intended. . . ."" Pereira v. United States, 347 U.S. 1, 8-9, 74 S. Ct. 358, 98 L. 
Ed. 435 (1954); see also Maze, 414 U.S. at 399-400; United States v. Serang, 156 F.3d 910, 914 (9th Cir. 1998); 
Sawyer, 85 F.3d at 723 n.6; United States v. Alexander, 135 F.3d 470, 474-75 (7th Cir. 1998); United States v. 
McClelland, 868 F.2d 704, 707 (5th Cir. 1989); United States v. Haimowitz, 725 F.2d 1561, 1571 (11th Cir. 1984); 
United States v. Diggs, 613 F.2d 988, 998, 198 U.S. App. D.C. 255 (D.C. Cir. 1979).
The ""causing"" requirement does not impose an onerous burden. United States v. Weisman, 83 F.2d 470, 474 (2d 
Cir. 1936) (interpreting 18 U.S.C. § 338, the former mail fraud statute). In Weisman, the defendant, who operated a 
fraudulent property purchase scheme, responded to a series of advertisements placed by individuals seeking to sell 
properties. The court of appeals noted that ""Weisman, so far as possible, abstained from using the mails in 
connection with his fraudulent transactions."" Id. at 472. However, with regard to one customer, Lewis, the defendant 
dictated a typewritten response to Lewis' advertisement, and the defendant's agent delivered the response to the 
newspaper by hand delivery. Id.
Unbeknownst to Weisman, Lewis had left instructions for the newspaper that any responses be forwarded to him by 
mail, and the newspaper followed these directions by sending Weisman's fraudulent response to Lewis. Id. 
Therefore, ""[i]n spite of [Weisman's] general efforts on his part to avoid the use of the mails, they undoubtedly were 
used for the purpose of executing the schemes to defraud"" [*2415]  his victims. Id. Moreover, despite the fact that 
Weisman had not himself used the mails, and neither intended -- nor even knew of -- Lewis' instructions to the 
newspaper to forward Weisman's response, he in fact ""caused"" the letter to be mailed:
22 Altria argues that there is no legal justification for piercing its corporate veil. However, Defendant's argument misses the point. 
The United States does not seek to pierce Altria's corporate veil or to hold Altria liable under some form of agency theory. 
Rather, the Court holds that Altria is liable for its own violations of RICO and its participation in the Enterprise, in part due to its 
control of Philip Morris policies, research, and public statements and, in part, due to its own individual actions. Altria is itself party 
to the scheme to defraud consumers by denying the health effects of smoking, the addictiveness of nicotine, the manipulation of 
nicotine delivery from cigarettes, the hazards of secondhand smoke, and marketing to youth.
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118375, *2412

 
When Weisman had a letter delivered to the [New York] Times office in New York, there was every chance that 
the Times would forward it to its customer by mail. It has long been settled that a defendant may cause a letter 
to be sent or delivered by mail though such a mode of transmission was neither known nor intended, provided 
mailing or delivery by post might reasonably have been foreseen.
Id. at 473.
To counter the overwhelming circumstantial evidence showing the likelihood that Defendants would use mailings 
and wire transmissions to conduct the affairs of the Enterprise, Defendants rely on a Fifth Circuit case which held 
that ""the use of circumstantial evidence does not relieve the Government of its burden of establishing use of the 
mails 'beyond a mere likelihood or probability.'"" United States v. Massey, 827 F.2d 995, 999 (5th Cir. 1987). In 
Massey, the Fifth Circuit held that ""[c]ircumstantial evidence 'such as testimony regarding office practice' is 
sufficient only 'so long as the circumstances proven directly [*2416]  support the inference and exclude all 
reasonable doubt to the extent of overcoming the presumption of innocence."" Id. However, in that criminal case, 
evidence was presented which suggested it was just as likely that the mails weren't used as it was that they were. 
Thus, in Massey, a criminal case, unlike here, there was reasonable doubt as to whether the mails were used. In 
this case, the United States has proven by a preponderance of the evidence, and even beyond a reasonable doubt, 
that the mails and wires were used to transmit Defendants' fraudulent statements. Indeed, Defendants could not 
have carried out the Enterprise's scheme to defraud without mailings and wire transmissions of their fraudulent 
statements.
To establish a charge of mail or wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341 and 1343, the matter or communication sent 
via the mails or wires need not itself contain false or misleading information or evidence fraud. Rather, ""'innocent' 
mailings -- ones that contain no false information -- may supply the mailing element."" Schmuck v. United States, 
489 U.S. 705, 715, 109 S. Ct. 1443, 103 L. Ed. 2d 734 (1989) (citing Parr v. United States, 363 U.S. 370, 390, 80 S. 
Ct. 1171, 4 L. Ed. 2d 1277 (1960)); see also Philip Morris, 304 F. Supp. 2d at 70.
The D.C. Circuit has long held that 18 U.S.C. § 1341 does not require that any mailing utilized to establish a mail 
fraud prosecution be false: ""Under the mail fraud statute it [*2417]  is not necessary that the individual mailing relied 
upon by the prosecution be shown to be in any way false or inaccurate, if the matter mailed is utilized in furtherance 
of or pursuant to the scheme to defraud."" United States v. Reid, 533 F.2d 1255, 1263, 175 U.S. App. D.C. 120 
(D.C. Cir. 1976) (footnote omitted); see also Deaver v. United States, 155 F.2d 740, 744, 81 U.S. App. D.C. 148 
(D.C. Cir 1946) (""a 'scheme' may be fraudulent though no misrepresentation is made""); Tabas v. Tabas, 47 F.3d 
1280, 1294 n.18 (7th Cir. 1995); Kehr Packages, Inc. v. Fidelcor, Inc., 926 F.2d 1406, 1413-14 (7th Cir. 1991) (""The 
actual violation is the mailing, although the mailing must relate to the underlying fraudulent scheme. . . . The mailing 
need not contain any misrepresentations. Rather 'innocent' mailings — ones that contain no false information — 
may supply the mailing element.""). Moreover, ""it does not matter that some of these mailings contained no false or 
misleading information, and individually contained no pecuniary loss; routine and innocent mailings can also supply 
an element of the offense of mail fraud."" United States v. Hickok, 77 F.3d 992, 1004 (7th Cir. 1996) (citing United 
States v. Brocksmith, 991 F.2d 1363, 1368 (7 Cir. 1993)). th
Moreover, the mailing or wire transmission need not be essential to the scheme or succeed in deceiving; rather it 
need only be ""for the purpose of executing the scheme."" United States v. Maze, 414 U.S. 395, 400, 94 S. Ct. 645, 
38 L. Ed. 2d 603 (1974); see also United States v. Coyle, 63 F.3d 1239, 1244 (3d Cir. 1995); United States v. 
Waymer, 55 F.3d 564, 569 (11th Cir. 1995); Kehr Packages, 926 F.2d at 1413; United States v. Haimowitz, 725 
F.2d 1561, 1571 (11th Cir. 1984); United States v. Garner, 663 F.2d 834, 838 (9th Cir. 1981); Reid, 533 F.2d at 
1264. ""The relevant question at all times is whether the mailing is part of the execution of the scheme as conceived 
by the perpetrator at the time, regardless [*2418]  of whether the mailing later, through hindsight, may prove to have 
been counterproductive . . . ."" Schmuck, 489 U.S. at 715. In this case, Defendants caused the mailings and wire 
transmissions in order to communicate their fraudulent statements to the American public. See generally, Findings 
of Fact.
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118375, *2415

 
It should be noted that courts have taken a flexible approach to the ""in furtherance"" requirement, holding that it is 
sufficient that the mailing or wire transmission was ""incident to an essential part of the scheme. . . or a step in [the] 
plot."" Schmuck, at 711 (quoting Badders v. United States, 240 U.S. 391, 394, 36 S. Ct. 367, 60 L. Ed. 706 (1916)); 
see also United States v. Sun-Diamond Growers, 138 F.3d 961, 972, 329 U.S. App. D.C. 149 (D.C. Cir. 1998), aff'd, 
526 U.S. 398, 119 S. Ct. 1402, 143 L. Ed. 2d 576 (1999); Coyle, 63 F.3d at 1244; United States v. Waymer, 55 F.3d 
564, 569 (11th Cir. 1995); United States v. Hollis, 971 F.2d 1441, 1448 (10th Cir. 1992); United States v. Wormick, 
709 F.2d 454, 462 (7th Cir. 1983) (""mailings made to promote the scheme . . . or which facilitate the concealment of 
the scheme""); United States v. McClelland, 868 F.2d 704, 707-09 (5th Cir. 1989) (mailings which tended to further 
the scheme).
In this case, all of the Racketeering Acts promoted and furthered Defendants' execution of their fraudulent scheme 
to maximize their profits, to avoid costly verdicts, and to derail attempts to make smoking socially unacceptable by 
perpetrating the deceptions which have already been enumerated and described in great detail in the Findings of 
Fact.
The evidence shows that it was the Defendant's routine or standard business practice -- which one would expect of 
any major corporation -- to send [*2419]  or receive matters via the mails or wire transmission. Moreover, 
Defendants spoke or wrote their fraudulent statements with the knowledge that the use of the mails and wires 
""c[ould] reasonably be foreseen."" Pereira, 347 U.S. at 8-9. Finally, each of the alleged mailings and wire 
transmissions was in furtherance of the overarching scheme to defraud. Accordingly, the United States has proven 
that Defendants ""caused"" the mailings and wire transmissions underlying the Racketeering Acts in an effort to 
further the scheme to defraud.
a. Defendants' Routine Mailing Practices
The evidence is undisputed that Defendants employed the following routine mailing practices.23
(1) Philip Morris
All of Philip Morris' incoming mail flows either to its Richmond, Virginia, or New York City, New York mail room 
facilities. Approximately 80% of its United States mail would have flowed through Philip Morris' central Richmond 
facilities prior to September 11, 2001. Since September 11, 2001, approximately 85% of the incoming 
correspondence and packages arriving at Philip Morris' Richmond mail room was sent by U.S. Mail. Philip Morris 
estimated that as of July 1, 2002, about three-quarters of items [*2420]  arriving in its New York mail room were 
sent by U.S. Mail. Since September 11, 2001, 75% of the mails and materials Philip Morris has sent have been 
transmitted by U.S. Mail. Philip Morris did not begin using private courier or commercial carriers, e.g. Fedex 
(formerly Federal Express), DHL, Airborne Express, and United Parcel Service, to send correspondence or 
packages any earlier than 1967. Philip Morris now uses fax machines, an Internet web site, and e-mail, as well as 
United States Mail, to transmit documents. Dale Frazier Dep., 33:20-34:10, 20:12-20:17, 12:12-13:17, 22:6-18, 
42:19-43:17, 23:10-23:15, 42:19-43:17.
(2) Lorillard
23 Prior to 1974, the United States Mail was virtually the only means of authorized postal delivery in the United States. See Air 
Courier Conference of America v. American Postal Workers Union, 498 U.S. 517, 519, 111 S. Ct. 913, 112 L. Ed. 2d 1125 
(1991); O'Brien, 644 F. Supp. at 142. Moreover, effective September 13, 1994, Congress amended the mail fraud statute to 
attach liability to anyone who in furtherance of a scheme to defraud, ""deposits or causes to be deposited any matter or thing 
whatever to be sent or delivered by any private or commercial interstate carrier."" Pub. L. No. 102-322 (codified as amended at 
18 U.S.C. § 1341 (1994)). See also In re clerkship of Sabita Soneji, 128 F. Supp. 2d 1287 (D.D.C. 2004-2006).
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118375, *2418

 
Since 1994, seventy-five percent of the total mailings to and from Lorillard have been made via U.S. Mail. Lorillard 
generally sends its public statements and press releases electronically to the news organizations. Becky Wright 
Dep., 6/27/02, 14:11-14:25.
(3) Liggett
Liggett sends correspondence by U.S. Mail and commercial carriers. Liggett did not transmit documents by 
facsimile until the mid-1980s.
(4) R.J. Reynolds
In 1968, U.S. Mail was generally R.J. Reynolds' only means of transmitting documents. During the 1970s, most of 
R.J. Reynolds' correspondence [*2421]  was transmitted by U.S. Mail. Gwendowlyn Beck Joyner Dep., 6/28/02, 
14:18-15:22.
(5) The Tobacco Institute
The Tobacco Institute transmitted its booklet, ""Helping Youth Decide,"" by U.S. Mail when single copies were 
requested. U.S. Mail was the Tobacco Institute's most frequent mode of sending correspondence. Approximately 
90% of its incoming mail was delivered by U.S. mail and 90% of its press releases were sent by U.S. Mail. William 
Adams Dep. 6/19/02, 448:02-11, 454:19-455:01, 479:20-480:04.
(6) Council For Tobacco Research
The Council For Tobacco Research (""CTR"") sent its annual reports through mailing houses. Individual requests for 
the annual reports were answered with U.S. Mail packages. More often than not, CTR used the U.S. Mail to send 
award letters, checks, and routine correspondence to grantees. It used U.S. Mail to send correspondence and 
funds to special projects recipients, and the recipients' affiliated institutions, as well as to send minutes of board of 
directors meetings and annual meetings. CTR used U.S. Mail to send agenda books containing applications for 
review by its Scientific Advisory Board. CTR did not acquire a fax machine until 1989 or 1990. Harmon 
McAllister [*2422]  Dep, 5/24/02, 65:11-66:19, 67:07-18.
b. Prior Stipulations and Admissions Establish the Mailings and Wire Transmissions Underlying 79 of the 
Alleged 145 Racketeering Acts
Defendants' stipulations and admissions proved that they ""caused"" the mailings and wire transmissions underlying 
the following 79 Racketeering Acts: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 17, 18, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 
38, 42, 44, 45, 46, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 57, 60, 63, 66, 67, 68, 70, 73, 77, 79, 81, 82, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 94, 96, 
98, 99, 103, 104, 105, 106, 108, 109, 110, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 121, 122, 124, 125, 127, 129, 132, 133, 143, 
144, 145, and 146. See United States Proposed Findings of Fact, Section IV, Paragraphs 1-5; see also United 
States Final Proposed Conclusions of Law (vol. 1), (I)(G)(5)(d).24
24 The Court attempted to be very certain about the Racketeering Acts to which Defendants have stipulated or admitted the 
""causing"" requirement, but it proved impossible. Both the Government's and Defendants' papers on this issue are unclear and at 
times inconsistent. For example, the Government states in its July 1, 2004 Proposed Conclusions of Law that Defendants' 
stipulations and admissions on the ""causing"" requirement include Racketeering Acts 68, 115, 118, 124, 125, 127, 129, and 144. 
However, in its Post-Trial Proposed Findings of Fact, those Racketeering Acts are not included in the list of stipulations and 
admissions on ""causing."" With no guidance from the parties, the Court is left to guess.
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118375, *2420

 
c. The Mailings and Wire Transmissions Underlying the Alleged Racketeering Acts Which Involve 
Defendants' Press Releases and Advertisements Were Disseminated to the Public Via the United States 
Mails and Wire Transmissions
The United States established that Defendants' issued their advertisements and press releases in various 
newspapers and magazines, that were thereafter disseminated to the [*2423]  public via the United States Mails. 
For example, the ""Frank Statement to Cigarette Smokers"", which underlies Racketeering Act 1, was published on 
January 4, 1954 in 448 newspapers throughout the United States.
The Court has already taken judicial notice that since 1954, the following newspapers have been routinely sent to 
subscribers via U.S. Mail, and that this practice was reasonably foreseeable as to each Defendant: Atlanta 
Constitution; Atlanta Journal; Boston Globe; Charlotte Observer; Chicago Tribune; Los Angeles Times; Miami 
Herald; New York Times; San Diego Union-Tribune; Washington Post. Order #616. In addition, the Court has 
already taken judicial notice that the following newspapers have been routinely sent to subscribers via United 
States Mail beginning in the years noted, and that this practice was reasonably foreseeable as to each Defendant: 
Atlanta Journal-Constitution - 2001; New York Post - 1993; Philadelphia Inquirer - 1970; Village Voice - 1959. Id.
The Court has taken judicial notice that since 1954, the following magazines have been routinely sent to 
subscribers via U.S. Mail, and that this practice was reasonably foreseeable as to each Defendant: Car Craft; 4-
Wheel [*2424]  & Off-Road; Glamour; Hot Rod; Mademoiselle (through 2001); Motorcyclist; Playboy; Vogue. Id. The 
Court has taken judicial notice that the following magazines have been routinely sent to subscribers via U.S. Mail 
beginning in the years noted, and that this practice was reasonably foreseeable as to each Defendant: Allure - 
1991; ESPN The Magazine - 1998; GQ-Gentlemen's Quarterly - 1957; Maxim - 1997. Id. Accordingly, Defendants 
caused the Racketeering Acts by publishing press releases and advertisements in the listed newspapers or 
magazines.
Moreover, when a Defendant sends press releases and advertisements to newspapers and magazines for 
dissemination, it is obviously reasonably foreseeable that the newspapers and magazines will use the U.S. Mail to 
send such matter to their subscribers, and therefore, that such Defendant ""caused"" the use of the mails within the 
meaning of the mail fraud statute. See, e.g., Carpenter, 484 U.S. at 28 (""[U]sing the wires and the mail to print and 
send the [Wall Street] Journal to its customers"" containing the column at issue ""was not only anticipated but an 
essential part of the scheme.""); Atlas Pile Driving Co. v. DiCon Financial Co., 886 F.2d 986, 992 (8th Cir. 1989) (""[I]t 
was almost certain that notice of [foreclosure sales] would be mailed to other claimants [*2425]  or that notice would 
be published in newspapers and copies of the notice distributed through the mails.""); United States v. Bowers, 644 
F.2d 320 (4th Cir. 1981) (holding that it was reasonably foreseeable that newspapers would be mailed to some 
subscribers containing the advertisements the defendant placed in the newspaper); United States v. Shepherd, 587 
F.2d 943, 944 (8th Cir. 1978); United States v. Buchanan, 544 F.2d 1322, 1324-25 (5th Cir. 1977); Pritchard v. 
United States, 386 F.2d 760, 764 (8th Cir. 1967) (same for advertisements in magazines as well as newspapers); 
Atkinson v. United States, 344 F.2d 97, 98-99 (8th Cir. 1965) (same for advertisements in newspapers); Weisman, 
83 F.2d at 473 (holding that it was reasonably foreseeable to the defendant that the letter he hand-delivered to a 
newspaper in response to an advertisement would be sent by the newspaper to its customer via the U.S. mails).
For the foregoing reasons, it is clear beyond any question that Defendants caused the mailings and wire 
transmissions underlying the 30 Racketeering Acts involving the news media's dissemination of Defendants' press 
releases and advertisements to their subscribers.
d. Defendants Caused Wire, Radio, and Television Transmissions Underlying the Racketeering Acts
Defendants caused the Racketeering Acts which involved wire, radio, and television transmissions. As Pereira 
noted, ""Where one does an act with knowledge that the use of the mails [or wires] will follow in the ordinary course 
of business, or where [*2426]  such use can reasonably be foreseen, even though not actually intended, then he 
'causes' the mails to be used."" 347 U.S. at 8-9 (1954). Here, too, there can be no question that it was reasonably 
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118375, *2422

 
foreseeable that Defendants' representatives' statements would be broadcast to the public via the wire, radio, and 
television transmissions. Indeed, 18 U.S.C. § 1343 explicitly provides that it applies when a person ""causes to be 
transmitted by means of . . . television communication in interstate or foreign commerce"" a communication to 
execute a scheme to defraud.
For instance, various statements from Defendants' internet websites are or were published on the worldwide web, a 
global network of computers which employs telephone, fiberoptic, and other wire and wireless infrastructures. 
Similarly, telephone communications, telexes, cable letters, telegrams, e-mails, facsimile transmissions, and 
television and radio involve the use of wire and radio/television signals in interstate and/or foreign commerce. 
Therefore, Racketeering Acts 103-116, 130, 134, 137, and 143-147 were transmitted by use of the wires, radio, and 
television signals in interstate and/or foreign commerce. 689033421-3421 (US 31045); 508293416-3416 (US 
21514); 1002605545-5564 [*2427]  (US 35622); 680273641-3643 (US 20998); 504331775-1776 (US 22738); 
301030943-0944 (US 46577); 2029200293-0294 (US 21537); 450010016-0019 (US 21539); 690149518-9531 at 
9520 (US 21046); 690149518-9531 (US 78732); TLT0770044-0049 (US 86656); TLT0770095-0128 (US 72410).
e. The Mailings and Wire Transmissions Involving Communications Were Sent or Received by Defendants 
or their Representatives
Defendants caused the mailings and wire transmissions, which involve communications sent or received by 
Defendants and their representatives, that underlie the remaining Racketeering Acts. It was Defendants' routine or 
standard business practice to send or receive matters via the mails or wire transmissions. Therefore, it was 
reasonably foreseeable that the mails would be used by a Defendant or by a third-party as a result of a Defendant's 
actions in the ordinary course of business. Moreover, 33 of the 41Racketeering Acts which Defendants challenge 
involve correspondence mailed from one city to another. They are Racketeering Acts 2, 3, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 
15, 16, 19, 20, 21, 22, 27, 33, 40, 41, 58, 62, 69, 71, 72, 74, 75, 79, 80, 81, 85, 117, 132 and 133.
In addition, Defendants ""caused"" the mailings [*2428]  of matters which they had sent or received in response to 
correspondence that they sent. See, e.g., United States v. Hollis, 971 F.2d 1441, 1448 (10th Cir. 1992); McClelland, 
868 F.2d at 707; Diggs, 613 F.2d at 998-99; United States v. United Medical & Surgical Supply Corp., 989 F.2d 
1390, 1404 (4th Cir. 1993) (defendant's broker mailed fraudulent reports); United States v. Bortnovsky, 879 F.2d 
30, 36-37 (2d Cir. 1989) (defendant's agent sent the mailings); United States v. Tiller, 302 F.3d 98, 103 (3d Cir. 
2002) (defendant's employer). For purposes of Section 1341, when a defendant sets a course of events in motion, 
and then receives a mailing in response to his action, he is deemed to have ""caused"" the use of the mails. See, 
e.g., United States v. Toliver, 541 F.2d 958, 966-67 (2d Cir. 1976) (where defendants made fraudulent 
representations to state unemployment office, which then mailed unemployment checks to defendants, defendants 
""caused"" the mailings); United States v. Otto, 742 F.2d 104, 109 (3d Cir. 1984) (letter written by investor-victim was 
responsive to defendant's failure to fulfill terms of earlier agreement); United States v. Weisman, 83 F.2d 470, 472-
73 (2d Cir. 1936).25
In light of Defendants' routine mailing practices, Defendants ""caused"" the mailings and wire transmissions of 
correspondence they sent or received which furthered the Enterprise's scheme to defraud.
f. The Cigarette Company Defendants Are Liable for the Mailings and Wire Transmissions Underlying the 
Racketeering Acts Committed By Defendants CTR and TI
25 Furthermore, it is important to note that 18 U.S.C. § 1341 proscribes not only sending the communication in furtherance of the 
scheme to defraud, but also receiving the communication. See, e.g., United States v. Coyle, 943 F.2d 424, 425 (4th Cir. 1991). 
For instance, as detailed in Racketeering Act 17, CTR mailed a communication to Liggett, Philip Morris, Reynolds, Brown & 
Williamson, and Lorillard. In addition to the cigarette company Defendants'""causing"" CTR to send the mailing, they (as members 
of the scheme to defraud) are liable for receiving it.
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118375, *2426

 
All Defendant cigarette companies who were members of or involved in CTR and TI are liable for the mailings and 
wire transmissions caused by these [*2429]  organizations26 under the predicate provisions of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341 
and 1343, the mail and wire fraud statutes, respectively.27
Each of the six cigarette company Defendants participated in the creation, funding, and support of TIRC/CTR and 
TI. See Findings of Fact Sections III(B, C, D). They formed, funded, and staffed these entities in order that they 
would further the Enterprise's scheme to defraud. Specifically, these entities funded research supporting 
Defendants' position on smoking and health issues and served as a forum to issue public statements on smoking 
and health and related matters. See id. The cigarette company Defendants provided directors and officers of the 
organizations; reviewed, approved or recommended approval of various research proposals and public statements 
(including research reports and press releases); and provided many other forms of advice and assistance which 
both enabled and encouraged the mailings and wire transmissions at issue. See id. Indeed, Defendants' essential 
purpose in forming CTR and TI was to use them to issue advertisements, press releases, and research reports.
There can be no question that the cigarette company Defendants are liable for the Racketeering Acts [*2430]  
committed by CTR and TI under the mail and wire fraud statutes. As has already been noted, to establish a 
violation of the mail fraud statute it is not necessary to show that the defendant itself actually mailed anything; it is 
sufficient instead to prove that it caused a mailing or that use of the mails was reasonably foreseeable from its 
actions. The mailings and wire transmissions of CTR and TI were reasonably foreseeable or otherwise ""caused"" by 
the six cigarette company Defendants, given the involvement of those Defendants in their creation, funding, and 
ongoing activities. Therefore, the Defendant tobacco companies must be held liable for the mailings of CTR and TI. 
United States v. Rodgers, 624 F.2d 1303, 1308-1309 (5th Cir. 1980) (""co-schemers"" liable for mail fraud); United 
States v. Craig, 573 F.2d 455 (7th Cir. 1977); Maxwell, 920 F.2d at 1036 (""All that is required is that appellant have 
knowingly and willingly participated in the scheme; she need not have performed every key act herself""); Amrep 
Corp., 560 F.2d at 545 (""So long as a transaction is within the general scope of a scheme on which all defendants 
had embarked, a defendant not directly connected with a particular fraudulent act is nonetheless responsible 
therefor if it was of the kind as to which all parties had agreed.""); United States v. Stapleton, 293 F.3d 1111, 1115-
16 (9th Cir. 2002); United States v. Joyce, 499 F.2d 9, 16 (7th Cir. 1974) (""As a member of a mail fraud scheme, 
[the defendant] [*2431]  was responsible for any letter which any other member of the scheme caused to be mailed 
in execution of the scheme"").
2. The First Amendment Does Not Protect Defendants' False and Misleading Public Statements
Defendants argue that all of their public statements denying nicotine manipulation, the addictiveness of cigarettes, 
and youth marketing are statements of opinion, made in the course of petitioning the government, and, therefore, 
deserve the full protection of the First Amendment. Defs.' Corrected Post-Trial Brief at 82, 87.28 Specifically, 
Defendants rely upon the Noerr-Pennington doctrine to immunize all of their public statements under the First 
Amendment. Id. Defendants also allege that the Government must prove by ""a heightened 'clear and convincing' 
standard of proof,"" rather than a ""preponderance of the evidence"" standard, that all their statements were 
intentionally fraudulent. Id.
26 See Racketeering Acts 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 17, 18, 21, 23, 24, 27, 29, 31, 33, 34, 35, 42, 43, 44, 46, 49, 56, 66, 67, 70, 
73, 77, 79, 81, 87, 88, 91, 93, 98, 117, 118, 120, 130, 132, and 133.
27 The Government has argued that Defendants are liable for CTR and TI's racketeering acts as aiders and abettors under 18 
U.S.C. § 2(a) (""[w]hoever commits an offense against the United States or aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or 
procures its commission, is punishable as a principal""). However, because the Court finds Defendants caused CTR and TI's 
mailings on other grounds, it need not reach that issue.
28 In particular, Defendants single out the testimony of their CEOs at the Waxman hearings and a May, 1994 letter from Phillip 
Morris to Rep. Waxman expressing the view that nicotine is not addictive, to show that Defendants were primarily engaged in 
influencing governmental action. Defs. Corrected Post-Trial Brief at 82, 87.
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118375, *2428

 
The Court finds that only those statements Defendants made directly to legislative bodies merit Noerr-Pennington 
immunity. However, to be clear, it must be remembered that the vast majority of Defendants' statements were made 
with the primary purpose of influencing smokers, potential smokers, and the general public and are, therefore, not 
protected [*2432]  by the Noerr-Pennington doctrine. As to the latter category, the Court finds that the Government 
has met its burden of proof to show that those statements were fraudulent.
a. Noerr-Pennington Protects Only Those Defendants' Statements Made in the Course of Petitioning the 
Legislature; It Does Not Immunize Statements Made with the Purpose of Influencing Smokers, Potential 
Smokers, and the General Public
The Noerr-Pennington doctrine was developed as a direct application of the Petition Clause of the First 
Amendment.29 See Falise v. American Tobacco Co., 94 F. Supp. 2d 316, 350 (E.D.N.Y. 2000) (quoting Kottle v. 
Northwest Kidney Centers, 146 F.3d 1056, 1059) (9th Cir. 1998)). The doctrine holds that ""the Sherman Act does 
not prohibit . . . persons from associating together in an attempt to persuade the legislature or the executive to take 
particular action with respect to a law that would produce a restraint or a monopoly."" E. R.R. Presidents Conference 
v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 136, 81 S. Ct. 523, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464 (1961); accord United Mine Workers 
v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 85 S. Ct. 1585, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626 (1965).30
Clearly, not every public relations campaign qualifies under Noerr-Pennington as ""petitioning the government;""31 if 
that were the case, the Noerr-Pennington doctrine would extend to virtually all activities. Here, the majority of the 
racketeering acts alleged as part of the addiction and manipulation sub-schemes do not constitute petitioning 
activity before the Congress, or the executive [*2433]  branch. On the contrary, most of those acts are simply press 
releases or advertisements aimed at influencing smokers, potential smokers, and the public, and do not constitute 
""attempt[s] to persuade the legislature or the executive to take particular action,"" Noerr Motor Freight, 365 U.S. at 
136. See e.g., Racketeering Acts Nos. 15, 25, 37, 39, 53, 56, 58, 60, 63, 71, 72, 74, 75, 79, 81, 103, 104, 116, 132, 
and 133. Consequently, these acts do not fall under the protective umbrella of the Noerr-Pennington doctrine.
Six Racketeering Acts remain. They are comprised of the CEOs' testimony before the Waxman Subcommittee and 
the letter from Philip Morris to Rep. Waxman and fall into a different category. Unlike Defendants' many statements 
that target smokers, potential smokers, and the general public, the remaining six acts constitute direct attempts to 
persuade government officials. The Court finds that these six acts merit Noerr-Pennington immunity as ""petitioning 
activity"" and are therefore not actionable.
29 ""Congress shall make no law respecting . . . the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for 
a redress of grievances."" U.S. Const. Amend. 1.
30 Noerr-Pennington immunity is not absolute. It allows a ""sham"" exception for ""situations in which persons use the governmental 
process -- as opposed to the outcome of that process -- as a . . . weapon. A classic example is the filing of frivolous objections to 
the license application of a competitor, with no expectation of achieving denial of the license but simply in order to impose 
expense and delay."" City of Columbia v. Omni Outdoor Advertising, 499 U.S. 365, 380, 111 S. Ct. 1344, 113 L. Ed. 2d 382 
(1991) (emphasis in original) (internal citations omitted).
31 See Falise, 94 F. Supp. 2d at 351-352, where plaintiffs alleged that defendant tobacco manufacturers had historically invested 
RICO racketeering funds in a ""scorched earth litigation strategy"" designed to intimidate them into not suing defendants. 
Defendants had argued that the Noerr-Pennington doctrine immunized their earlier litigation strategies.
The Falise court held that the Noerr-Pennington doctrine did not apply because the challenged conduct had nothing to do with 
petitioning. ""Defendants, having been hailed into court in the earlier litigation, were clearly not exercising their right to petition the 
government."" Instead, Defendants' right to utilize the tools of the adversarial process ""invoke[d] issues of procedural due process 
under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, rather than the First Amendment right to petition the government."" Id.
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118375, *2431

 
b. The Government Has Met the Necessary Standard of Proof to Show that Defendants' Actions Are 
Fraudulent
""[T]he First Amendment does not shield fraud."" Moreover, as the Supreme Court has recently [*2434]  ruled, 
""simply labeling an action one for 'fraud' . . . will not carry the day."" Illinois ex rel. Madigan v. Telemarketing Assocs., 
538 U.S. 600, 612, 617, 123 S. Ct. 1829, 155 L. Ed. 2d 793 (2003).32 Generally, a plaintiff must prove five elements 
by ""clear and convincing evidence"" to prevail on a fraud claim. See e.g., Armstrong v Accrediting Council 
Continuing Educ. & Training, Inc., 961 F. Supp. 305, 309 (D.D.C. 1997). They are: (1) a false representation, (2) in 
reference to a material fact, (3) made with the knowledge of its falsity, (4) with the intent to deceive, and (5) on 
which action is taken in reliance upon the representation. Id.
The Government claims that a ""clear and convincing"" standard of proof does not apply here, arguing that 
""fraudulent representations are judged by the same standard of proof -- preponderance of the evidence — 
applicable to the United States' civil RICO and RICO conspiracy claims."" Defendants, on the other hand, cite a 
number of Supreme Court opinions, such as Madigan, for the proposition that a clear and convincing standard of 
proof is required. Defs.' Corrected Post-Trial Brief at 27.
Defendants are correct that Madigan provides at least some support for a clear and convincing standard of proof 
requirement in cases of fraudulent representation involving speech. See 538 U.S. at 619-21. Madigan held that 
""[a]s restated in Illinois case law, to prove a defendant liable for fraud, [*2435]  the complainant must [show that 
defendant's actions satisfy the five requirements for fraud and] these showings must be made by clear and 
convincing evidence."" Id. at 620 (emphasis added) (citations omitted). Moreover, ""[e]xacting proof requirements of 
this order . . . have been held to provide sufficient breathing room for protected speech."" Id. at 620-21 (citing New 
York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 279-80, 84 S. Ct. 710, 11 L. Ed. 2d 686 (1964)); Bose Corp. v. 
Consumers Union of United States, Inc., 466 U.S. 485, 502, 104 S. Ct. 1949, 80 L. Ed. 2d 502 (1984)). This Court 
has previously noted that because Madigan was applying Illinois state law, which did mandate the use of a clear 
and convincing standard of proof, that the Supreme Court did not hold that that standard was necessarily mandated 
in all federal cases involving fraud. See Mem. Op. to Order # 624 at 3.
In this case, the evidence of Defendants' fraud is so overwhelming that it easily meets the clear and convincing 
standard of proof.33 The Findings of Fact lay out in exhaustive detail the myriad ways in which Defendants made 
public statements, often directly to consumers, which were flatly contradicted by their internal correspondence, 
knowledge, and understanding. Thus, whichever standard of proof is required to show fraud, the Court finds that the 
Government has met its burden.
3. Defendants Engaged in a Pattern of Racketeering Activity in [*2436]  Furtherance of the Scheme to 
Defraud
32 Fraudulent statements are entitled to a lesser level of protection than other speech because ""the intentional lie [does not] 
materially advance society's interest in uninhibited, robust, and wide-open debate on public issues."" Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 
418 U.S. 323, 340, 94 S. Ct. 2997, 41 L. Ed. 2d 789 (1974).
33 As this Court previously stated, ""the standard of proof required to show that speech is fraudulent . . . is a thorny issue,"" where 
case law is not settled. Mem. Op. To Order #624 at 3 n.1. The Court need not decide this issue here because there is ample 
proof of Defendants' fraud under any standard that could be applied. The Government's evidence is sufficient to satisfy both a 
preponderance of the evidence standard and a clear and convincing evidence standard. Accordingly, the Court finds it 
unnecessary to make a broad statement concerning which standard of proof is required in cases involving alleged intentionally 
fraudulent statements.
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118375, *2433

 
a. Each Defendant Committed at Least Two Racketeering Acts, the Last One of Which Occurred Within Ten 
Years from the Commission of the Prior Racketeering Act
To establish the commission of a pattern of racketeering activity, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961(5) and 1962(c) require that 
each defendant commit at least two acts of racketeering, ""the last of which occurred within ten years . . . after the 
commission of a prior"" racketeering act. H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 237, 109 S. Ct. 2893, 
106 L. Ed. 2d 195 (1989). Because each Defendant has committed two or more Racketeering Acts within ten years 
of each other, that standard is clearly met in this case. See generally Findings of Fact.
Defendants assert, without citing any authority or offering any analysis, that the United States must prove that each 
Defendant committed two or more racketeering acts within ten years of each other as to each aspect of the over-
arching scheme to defraud. Defs.' Corrected Trial Brief at 114. Defendants are wrong. The requirement of two 
racketeering acts pertains to the pattern of racketeering activity, which in this case is the overall scheme to defraud 
itself, and not the hundreds of individual discrete predicate activities that comprise it.
18 U.S.C. § 1961(5) establishes that a ""pattern of racketeering [*2437]  activity requires at least two acts of 
racketeering activity, one of which occurred after October 15, 1970 (the date on which the RICO statute was 
enacted) and the last of which occurred within ten years (excluding any period of imprisonment) after the 
commission of a prior act of racketeering activity."" The Supreme Court has concluded that in light of the ""very 
relaxed limits of the pattern concept fixed in § 1961(5) . . . Congress intended to take a flexible approach, and 
envisaged that a pattern might be demonstrated by reference to a range of different ordering principles or 
relationships between predicates,"" H.J., Inc. v. Nw. Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 239, 109 S. Ct. 2893, 106 L. Ed. 2d 
195 (1989); see also Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479, 486-490, 105 S. Ct. 3275, 87 L. Ed. 2d 346 
(1985). Furthermore, the Court explained that ""RICO's legislative history reveals Congress' intent that to prove a 
pattern of racketeering activity a plaintiff or prosecutor must show that the racketeering predicates are related, and 
that they amount to or pose a threat of continued criminality."" Id.
The Supreme Court has explained that ""criminal conduct forms a pattern if it embraces criminal acts that have the 
same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of commission, or otherwise are interrelated by 
distinguishing characteristics and are not isolated [*2438]  events. . . . We find no support . . . that predicate acts of 
racketeering may form a pattern only when they are part of separate illegal schemes."" H.J., Inc. at 236. Under this 
reasoning, it is clear that the predicate acts of racketeering need not relate to separate illegal schemes, nor must 
they relate to each aspect of the over-arching scheme to defraud. Rather, the evidence cited in the Findings of Fact 
demonstrates that each Defendant has therefore committed more than two Racketeering Acts with respect to the 
Enterprise's overall scheme to defraud.
b. The Racketeering Acts Are Related and Continuous
The Supreme Court has stated that ""to prove a pattern of racketeering activity a plaintiff or prosecutor must show 
that the racketeering predicates are related,"" and that they either extended over ""a substantial period of time,"" ""or 
pose a threat of continued criminal activity."" H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 239, 242, 109 S. 
Ct. 2893, 106 L. Ed. 2d 195 (1989). This requirement is commonly referred to as the ""continuity plus relationship 
test."" Defendants' activities easily meet the test for ""a pattern of racketeering activity"" articulated by the Supreme 
Court.
(1) The Racketeering Acts Are Related
As already noted, the requisite relationship is established when the racketeering acts [*2439]  ""have the same or 
similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of commission, or otherwise are interrelated by 
distinguishing characteristics and are not isolated events."" Id. at 240. ""Congress intended to take a flexible 
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118375, *2436

 
approach, and envisaged that a pattern might be demonstrated by reference to a range of different ordering 
principles or relationships between predicates, within the expansive bounds set."" Id. at 238.
The federal courts of appeals have repeatedly held that the predicate racketeering acts under RICO need not be 
similar or directly related to each other. Rather, it is sufficient that the racketeering acts be related in some way to 
the affairs of the Enterprise, including furthering its goals or benefitting it in some way. See, e.g., United States v. 
Polanco, 145 F.3d 536, 541 (2d Cir. 1998); United States v. White, 116 F.3d 903, 925 n.7, 325 U.S. App. D.C. 282 
(D.C. Cir. 1997) (stating in jury instructions that in order to show a pattern of racketeering activity, the government 
must prove that ""the racketeering acts had the same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims or methods of 
commission or were otherwise interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and were not isolated events""); United 
States v. Eufrasio, 935 F.2d 553, 566 (3d Cir. 1991); United States v. Gonzalez, 921 F.2d 1530, 1540 (11th Cir. 
1991); United States v. Angiulo, 897 F.2d 1169, 1180 (1st Cir. 1990); United States v. Indelicato, 865 F.2d 1370, 
1382-84 (2d Cir. 1989) (en banc); United States v. Qaoud, 777 F.2d 1105, 1115 (6th Cir. 1985); United States v. 
Provenzano, 688 F.2d 194, 200 (3d Cir. 1982); United States v. Lee Stoller Enter., Inc., 652 F.2d 1313, 1319 (7th 
Cir. 1981); United States v. Elliott, 571 F.2d 880, 899 (5th Cir. 1978).
Defendants' Racketeering Acts are related. While Defendants argue that a ""multiplicity of [*2440]  mailings does not 
necessarily translate into a 'pattern' of racketeering activity,"" Lipin Enters., Inc. v. Lee, 803 F.2d 322, 325 (7th Cir. 
1986) (Cudahy, J., concurring), the evidence in this case demonstrates far more than a mere multiplicity of mailings. 
All the Racketeering Acts have the same or similar purposes and methods of commission: they each involve 
mailings or wire transmissions by Defendants to carry out the Enterprise's overarching scheme to defraud 
consumers and potential consumers of cigarettes. Moreover, all the predicate Racketeering Acts furthered the goals 
and purposes of the Enterprise to sustain and maximize profits, to avoid costly liability judgments, and to frustrate 
attempts to make smoking socially unacceptable.
(2) The Racketeering Acts Have Been Continuous
Many forms of proof may establish the required ""continuity."" H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 240-43. By way of illustration, the 
Supreme Court approved several alternative methods for meeting the ""continuity"" requirement, stating:
[1] A party alleging a RICO violation may demonstrate continuity over a closed period by proving a series of 
related predicates extending over a substantial period of time.
. . .
[2] A RICO pattern may surely be established if the related predicates themselves involve a distinct [*2441]  
threat of long-term racketeering activity, either implicit or explicit.
. . .
[3] The continuity requirement is likewise satisfied where it is shown that the predicates are a regular way of 
conducting defendant's ongoing legitimate business (in the sense that it is not a business that exists for 
criminal purposes), or of conducting or participating in an ongoing and legitimate RICO ""enterprise.""
Id. at 242-243. Following H.J. Inc., our Circuit has also adopted a flexible approach to determine whether 
""continuity"" has been proven. United States v. Richardson, 167 F.3d 621, 626, 334 U.S. App. D.C. 384 (D.C. Cir. 
1999).
In addition, as the Supreme Court, the D.C. Circuit and other courts have ruled, the requisite continuity may be 
shown by the overall nature of the Enterprise and its members, considered in their entirety, including uncharged 
unlawful activities. H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 242-43; Richardson, 167 F.3d at 626.
Here, Defendants' 145 racketeering acts occurred over a period of 45 years, which surely constitutes a ""substantial 
period"" of time. Moreover, these racketeering acts ""are a regular way of conducting defendant's ongoing legitimate 
business,"" H.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 243. Because Defendants are in a position to continue their fraudulent activity, ""the 
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118375, *2439

 
racketeering acts themselves include a specific threat of repetition extending indefinitely into the future."" [*2442]  Id. 
at 242. Thus, the requisite pattern of racketeering activity has been established.
4. Defendants Acted with the Specific Intent to Defraud or Deceive
Mail and wire fraud are specific intent crimes. United States v. Walker, 191 F.3d 326, 334 (2d. Cir. 1999). The D.C. 
Circuit has stated that specific intent ""requires more than a mere general intent to engage in certain conduct and to 
do certain acts."" United States v. Rhone, 864 F.2d 832, 834, 275 U.S. App. D.C. 10 (D.C. Cir 1989). Rather, 
specific intent requires a showing that a person ""knowingly does an act which the law forbids, intending with bad 
purpose either to disobey or disregard the law."" Id. In committing the racketeering acts that are at issue in this case, 
each Defendant acted with the requisite specific intent to defraud.
Liability for mail and wire fraud attaches if, under the totality of the circumstances, the defendant intentionally 
devised or participated in a scheme reasonably calculated to deceive with the purpose of either obtaining or 
depriving another of money or property. See, e.g., McEvoy Travel Bureau, Inc. v. Heritage Travel, Inc., 904 F.2d 
786, 791-93 (1st Cir. 1990); United States v. Cronic, 900 F.2d 1511, 1513-14 (10th Cir. 1990); Atlas Pile Driving, 
886 F.2d at 991; Blachly v. United States, 380 F.2d 665, 671 (5 Cir. 1967); Silverman v. United States, 213 F.2d 
405, 406 (5th Cir. 1954); Deaver, 155 F.2d at 743. Each individual racketeering act does not have to independently 
satisfy all of the elements of the mail and wire fraud statutes; the thing mailed or transmitted need only be intended 
to further the scheme in some way. Schmuck v. United States, 489 U.S. 705, 715, 109 S. Ct. 1443, 103 L. Ed. 2d 
734 (1989); see also Philip Morris, 304 F. Supp. 2d at 70.
A mail or wire fraud [*2443]  offense does not necessarily require proof of any misrepresentation of fact or 
affirmative false statement, although such would be highly probative of a scheme to defraud. Philip Morris, 304 F. 
Supp. 2d at 70; United States v. Halbert, 640 F.2d 1000, 1007 (9th Cir. 1981). The mail fraud statute covers all 
fraudulent and deceptive statements, including statements that are literally true but deceptive in the context in which 
they are made. See, e.g., Emery v. Am. Gen. Fin., Inc., 71 F.3d 1343, 1348 (7th Cir. 1995) (""A half truth, or what is 
usually the same thing a misleading omission, is actionable as fraud, including mail fraud if the mails are used to 
further it, if it is intended to induce a false belief and resulting action to the advantage of the misleader and the 
disadvantage of the misled""); United States v. Townley, 665 F.2d 579, 585 (5th Cir. 1982) (holding that misleading 
newspaper ads and letters which were mailed ""need not be false or fraudulent on their face, and the accused need 
not misrepresent any fact"" since ""it is just as unlawful to speak 'half truths' or to omit to state facts necessary to 
make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading""); United 
States v. Allen, 554 F.2d 398, 410 (10th Cir. 1977).
The United States has proven that Defendants have acted willfully and intentionally to further the Enterprise's 
scheme to defraud by making statements which were directly contrary to the internal, [*2444]  collective knowledge 
of each individual Defendant and the Enterprise as a whole. Accordingly, the Government has met its burden to 
show that Defendants acted with the specific intent to defraud or deceive.
a. Defendants Are Liable for the Acts of Their Officers, Employees, and Agents
Each Defendant is liable for the acts of its officers, employees, and agents. Because a corporation can act only 
through its agents, it may be held liable for the acts of its officers, employees, and other agents in certain 
circumstances. Meyer v. Holly, 537 U.S. 280, 285 (2003); Burlington Indus., Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U.S. 724, 756 
(1998); New York Central & Hudson R.R. v. United States, 212 U.S. 481, 494, 29 S. Ct. 304, 53 L. Ed. 613 (1909) 
(holding that ""a corporation is held responsible for acts not within the agent's corporate powers strictly construed, 
but which the agent has assumed to perform for the corporation when employing the corporate powers actually 
authorized, and in such cases there need be no written authority under seal or vote of the corporation in order to 
constitute the agency or to authorize the act""); R.R. Co. v. Hanning, 82 U.S. 649, 657, 21 L. Ed. 220 (1872) (finding 
that ""the principal is liable for the acts and negligence of the agent in the course of his employment, although he did 
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118375, *2441

 
not authorize or did not know of the acts complained of""); Restatement (Second) of Agency § 219, et seq. (1958). 
Specifically, under the theory of respondeat superior, a corporation may be held liable [*2445]  for the statements or 
wrongful acts of its agents or employees when they are acting within the scope of their authority or the course of 
their employment so long as the action is motivated, at least in part, to benefit the corporation. Sun-Diamond 
Growers, 138 F.3d at 970, aff'd, 526 U.S. 398, 119 S. Ct. 1402, 143 L. Ed. 2d 576 (1999); Local 1814, Int'l 
Longshoremen's Ass'n v. NLRB, 735 F.2d 1384, 1395, 236 U.S. App. D.C. 353 (D.C. Cir. 1984); Restatement 
(Second) of Agency § 236.
Furthermore, if a corporate agent exercises the authority conferred upon him and performs an act within the course 
of his employment, the corporation is liable even if the act was unlawful or was done contrary to instructions or 
policies, as long as the agent acted with an intent to benefit the corporation. United States v. Automated Med. Labs, 
770 F.2d 399, 407 (4th Cir. 1985); United States v. Beusch, 596 F.2d 871, 877 (9th Cir. 1979); United States v. 
Hilton Hotels Corp., 467 F.2d 1000, 1004 (9th Cir. 1972); United States v. Harry L. Young & Sons, Inc., 464 F.2d 
1295, 1296-97 (10th Cir. 1972); United States v. American Radiator & Standard Sanitary Corp., 433 F.2d at 204-05; 
Egan v. United States, 137 F.2d 369 (8th Cir. 1943).
While the federal courts of appeals have not reached a consensus about how the theory of respondeat superior 
applies specifically in RICO cases brought under § 1962(c), the Third, Sixth, and Eleventh Circuits have all found 
that where, as here, the defendant corporation is not the Enterprise itself, the corporation is liable for the acts of its 
officers. Cox v. Administrator United States Steel & Carnegie, 17 F.3d 1386, 1405 (11th Cir. 1994) (citing Petro-
Tech, Inc. V. Western Co., 824 F.2d 1349, 1361-62 (3rd Cir. 1987)) (finding that ""theories of respondeat superior . . 
. are not out of place"" where the defendants named are not the section 1962(c) enterprise); Davis v. Mutual Life Ins. 
Co., 6 F.3d 367,379 (6th Cir. 1998) (holding that ""[n]o . . . prohibition . . . prevents the imposition of liability 
vicariously on corporate 'persons' on account of the acts of their [*2446]  agents, particularly where the corporation 
benefitted by those acts.""). Similarly, the Ninth Circuit has held that ""an employer that is benefitted by its employee 
or agent's violations of section 1962(c) may be held liable under the doctrines of respondeat superior and agency 
when the employer is distinct from the enterprise."" Brady v. Dairy Fresh Products Co., 974 F.2d 1149, 1154 (9th 
Cir. 1992); compare with Miranda v. Ponce Federal Bank, 948 F.2d 41, 45 (1st Cir. 1991) (declining to apply 
""corporate liability on the enterprise's part under a theory of respondeat superior"") see also Luthi v. Tonka Corp., 
815 F.2d 1229, 1230 (8th Cir. 1987) (declining to apply respondeat superior where doing so would violate 
Congress's intent to separate the enterprise and the criminal ""person"").
There are strong public policy grounds supporting this approach. Applying respondeat superior ""will encourage 
employers to monitor more closely the activities of their employees and agents to ensure that these agents are not 
involved in racketeering activities. Thus, respondeat superior and agency liability furthers both the compensatory 
and deterrent goals of the RICO statute."" Brady, 974 F.2d at 1155. Likewise, the Sixth Circuit has held that a 
prohibition, if it existed, against imposing liability vicariously ""would prevent corporate 'persons' from ever being 
found liable under RICO, since corporate principals may only act through [*2447]  their agents. Such a rule would 
be manifestly contrary to the intent of Congress."" Davis v. Mutual Life Ins. Co. of New York, 6 F.3d 367, 379 (6th 
Cir. 1993). Similarly, in this vein, the Supreme Court has recognized that there is ""no good reason why corporations 
may not be held responsible for and charged with the knowledge and purposes of their agents, acting within the 
authority conferred upon them. . . . If it were not so, many offenses might go unpunished and acts be committed in 
violation of the law, where [as here] the statute requires all persons, corporate or private, to refrain from certain 
practices forbidden in the interest of public policy."" New York Central, 212 U.S. at 495.
b. Defendants Are Deemed to Possess the Collective Knowledge of Their Officers, Employees, and Agents
Corporations are liable for the collective knowledge of all employees and agents within (and acting on behalf of) the 
corporation. United States v. Bank of New England, N.A., 821 F.2d 844, 855-56 (1st Cir. 1987). In that case, the 
Bank of New England was convicted of violating the Currency Transaction Reporting Act for failing to report various 
financial transactions. At trial, the district court instructed the jury to consider the bank ""as an institution"" whose 
""knowledge is the sum of the knowledge of all the employees. That is, the bank's knowledge is the totality of what 
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118375, *2444

 
all of [*2448]  the employees know within the scope of their employment."" Id. at 855. As to intent, the Court 
instructed: ""If you find that the Government has proven with respect to any transaction either that an employee 
within the scope of his employment willfully failed to file a required report or that the bank was flagrantly indifferent 
to its obligations, then you may find that the bank has willfully failed to file the required reports."" Id.
On appeal, the bank challenged the trial court's instructions regarding its knowledge and intent. The bank 
contended that ""it is error to find that a corporation possesses a particular item of knowledge if one part of the 
corporation has half the information making up the item, and another part of the entity has the other half."" Id. at 856. 
The First Circuit rejected the bank's argument, finding the instructions correct as to both knowledge and intent. It's 
reasoning, which the Court finds highly persuasive, was that ""[a] collective knowledge instruction is entirely 
appropriate in the context of corporate criminal liability. . . . [T]he knowledge obtained by corporate employees 
acting within the scope of their employment is imputed to the corporation."" Id. at 856. In addition, the court [*2449]  
stressed that it would be unjust to allow a corporation to avoid liability merely because it chose to divide its 
knowledge, thus allowing it to ""plead innocence."" Id. (citations omitted). As the Eleventh Circuit emphasized in First 
Alabama Bank, N.A. v. First State Insurance Co., 899 F.2d 1045, 1060 n.8 (11th Cir. 1990), the reason that courts 
impose constructive knowledge upon the principal ""is to avoid the injustice which would result if the principal could 
have an agent conduct business for him and at the same time shield himself from the consequences which would 
ensue from knowledge of conditions or notice of the rights and interests of others had the principal transacted his 
own business in person.""
In cases decided after Bank of New England, courts have continued to allow the knowledge of agents and 
employees to be aggregated and imputed to the corporation. See, e.g., Sun-Diamond Growers, 964 F. Supp. at 491 
n.10 (D.D.C. 1997) (noting that the defendant ""makes much of the fact that purportedly no other corporate officials 
knew about Mr. Douglas' activities. However, knowledge obtained by a corporate agent acting within the scope of 
his employment is imputed to the corporation""), reversed on other grounds, 138 F.3d 961, 329 U.S. App. D.C. 149 
(D.C. Cir. 1998), aff'd, 526 U.S. 398, 119 S. Ct. 1402, 143 L. Ed. 2d 576 (1999). In In re Worldcom, Inc. Securities 
Litigation, for example, the court considered a challenge to certifications by [*2450]  accounting firm Arthur 
Andersen under the fraud provision of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. That statute, like the mail and wire 
fraud statutes, requires proof of ""an intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud."" 352 F. Supp. 2d 472 (S.D.N.Y. 
2005). Relying on Bank of New England, the District Court held that ""plaintiffs in securities fraud cases need not 
prove that any one individual employee of a corporate defendant also acted with scienter. Proof of a corporation's 
collective knowledge and intent is sufficient."" Id. at 497.
Thus, ""the knowledge of the employee is the knowledge of the corporation."" Apex Oil Co. v. United States, 530 F.2d 
1291, 1295 (8th Cir. 1976); see also United States v. Josleyn, 206 F.3d 144, 159 (1st Cir. 2000); United States v. 
Inv. Enters., 10 F.3d 263, 266 (5th Cir. 1993); Eitel v. Schmidlapp, 459 F.2d 609, 615 (4th Cir. 1972) (where 
defendant's agent fraudulently conveyed property to defendant, agent's knowledge of fraud would be imputed to 
principal even where there was no evidence of actual knowledge on part of principal: ""the principal cannot claim the 
fruits of the agent's acts and still repudiate what the agent knew.""); Duplex Envelope Co. v. Denominational 
Envelope Co., 80 F.2d 179, 182 (4th Cir. 1935).
Moreover, a principal is held responsible for the knowledge acquired by its agent even if the information is never 
communicated to it, see, e.g., N.Y. Univ. v. First Fin. Ins. Co., 322 F.3d 750, n.2 (2d Cir. 2003), and even after 
termination of the services of that officer, employee, or agent, see Acme Precision Prods., Inc. v. Am. Alloys Corp., 
422 F.2d 1395, 1398 (8th Cir. 1970).
In a much earlier case, dealing with somewhat different issues, the Supreme Court [*2451]  set forth its persuasive 
rationale for the collective knowledge doctrine:
[w]e see no valid objection in law, and every reason in public policy, why the corporation, which profits by the 
transaction, and can only act through its agents and officers, shall be held punishable by fine because of the 
knowledge and intent of its agents to whom it has entrusted authority to act in the subject-matter of making and 
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118375, *2447

 
fixing rates of transportation, and whose knowledge and purposes may well be attributed to the corporation for 
which the agents act.
New York Cent. & Hudson River R.R. Co. v. United States, 212 U.S. 481, 495, 29 S. Ct. 304, 53 L. Ed. 613 (1909).
Thus, the applicable case law makes clear that the knowledge, conduct, and statements of Defendants' agents and 
employees may be attributed to Defendants as corporate-principals.
c. Specific Intent May Be Established by the Collective Knowledge of Each Defendant and of the Enterprise 
as a Whole
In light of the extensive Findings of Fact describing what each Defendant company knew as well as the totality of 
the circumstances, the Court concludes that Defendants' fraudulent statements designated as Racketeering Acts 
evidence a specific intent to defraud. The Findings of Fact are replete with examples of representatives of each 
cigarette company Defendant, [*2452]  of CTR, and of the Tobacco Institute, either willfully stating something which 
they knew to be untrue or recklessly disregarding the falsity of their statements. A particularly egregious example is 
the use of hundreds of documents demonstrating Defendants' intent to offer smokers health reassurances with 
Light/Low Tar cigarettes even though Defendants knew that such cigarettes offer no meaningful reduction in 
disease risk. See Findings of Fact Section V(E)(5).
Many of the fraudulent, deceptive, and misleading statements were issued as press releases, paid newspaper 
statements, pamphlets, and similar documents in the name of the corporate Defendants themselves. For example, 
the Tobacco Institute's 1974 version of its pamphlet titled ""The Cigarette Controversy"" (no bates) (US 23020), was 
attributed to the Tobacco Institute itself, rather than any named individual. Likewise, the 1994 advertisement in the 
New York Times containing misleading and deceptive statements on nicotine and addiction titled, ""Facts You 
Should Know,"" (no bates) (US 65446), was issued by Philip Morris itself. In those instances, where such statements 
directly contradicted the internal knowledge of the company, specific [*2453]  intent to defraud is easily established. 
The overwhelming evidence that Defendants, collectively, possessed knowledge demonstrating the fraudulent 
nature of their public statements on, inter alia, the health effects of smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke, 
the addictiveness of smoking and nicotine, and their marketing to youth is set forth in the Findings of Fact.
Regarding those statements made by individuals rather than a Defendant company itself, which are clearly 
attributable to the Defendant company, those statements also demonstrate the requisite intent to defraud on the 
part of the company.
As discussed in detail above, the courts, including our Circuit, have established and affirmed the collective 
knowledge doctrine. However, the courts, including our Circuit, have uniformly rejected the theory of collective 
intent that the Government advocates -- i.e., that aggregation of different states of minds of various corporate actors 
is sufficient to demonstrate specific intent in cases where individuals within a corporation make fraudulent 
statements. Our Court of Appeals has stated that in Bank of New England, ""corporate knowledge of certain facts 
was accumulated from the knowledge [*2454]  of various individuals, but the proscribed intent (willfulness) 
depended on the wrongful intent of specific employees."" Saba v. Compagnie Nationale Air France, 78 F.3d 664, 
670 n.6, 316 U.S. App. D.C. 303 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (finding that ""[i]ndividual acts of negligence on the part of 
employees -- without more -- cannot . . . be combined to create a wrongful corporate intent."")34 ; see also United 
States v. L.B.S. Bank-New York, Inc., 757 F.Supp. 496, 501 n.7 (E.D. Pa. 1990) (""although knowledge possessed 
by employees is aggregated so that a corporate defendant is considered to have acquired the collective knowledge 
of its employees, specific intent cannot be aggregated similarly) (citations omitted); First Equity Corp. v. Standard & 
Poors Corp., 690 F.Supp. 256, 259-260 (S.D.N.Y. 1988) (holding that corporation cannot be deemed to have the 
requisite intent by mere inconsistences in knowledge of various employees).
34 Defendants try to read into this brief footnote more than is warranted. In light of the complexity and confusion in the law on this 
issue, it is hard to believe that this somewhat Delphic footnote will bear the weight which Defendants place on it.
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118375, *2451

 
At the same time, the courts, including our Circuit, have also rejected the theory of specific intent which Defendants 
advocate, i.e. requiring that a corporate state of mind can only be established by looking at each individual 
corporate agent at the time s/he acted. To do so would create an insurmountable burden for a plaintiff in corporate 
mail and wire fraud cases and frustrate the purposes of the statute.
While courts have not clearly articulated exactly what degree of proof is required, it is both appropriate and 
equitable to conclude that [*2455]  a company's fraudulent intent may be inferred from all of the circumstantial 
evidence including the company's collective knowledge. Saba, 78 F.3d at 668 (""the actor's intent may be inferred 
from indirect evidence and the reckless nature of his acts""); see also, Dana Corp. v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield 
Mutual of Northern Ohio, 900 F.2d 882, 886 n.2 (6th Cir. 1990); L.B.S. Bank-New York, 757 F. Supp. at 501 n.7.
Moreover, the public policy reasons which support the doctrine of collective knowledge apply equally here. There is 
""every reason in public policy"" why a corporation, which can only act through its agents and officers, and which 
profits by their actions, should be held liable when the totality of circumstances demonstrate that such corporation 
collectively knew what it was doing or saying was false, but did it or said it nevertheless, even if it is impossible to 
determine the state of mind of the individual agent or officer at the time. Indeed, if it were otherwise, Defendants 
could avoid liability by simply dividing up duties to ensure that fraudulent statements were only made by or 
uninformed employees.
Specific intent of individual Defendants and their employees can be inferred from the collective knowledge of each 
Defendant company itself and the reckless disregard of that knowledge evidenced in statements made by, and on 
behalf of, each [*2456]  Defendant company. Evidence establishing reckless disregard for the truth or falsity of a 
statement, as well as willful blindness, satisfies the intent standard. United States v. Munoz, 233 F.3d 1117, 1136 
(9th Cir. 2000) (""reckless indifference to the truth or falsity of a statement satisfies the specific intent requirement in 
a mail fraud case""); In re Korean Airlines Disaster of September 1, 1983, 704 F. Supp. 1135, 1136 (D.D.C. 1988), 
aff'd in relevant part, 932 F.2d 1475, 289 U.S. App. D.C. 391 (D.C. Cir. 1991); United States v. Prows, 118 F.3d 
686, 692 (10th Cir. 1997); United States v. Coyle, 63 F.3d 1239, 1243 (3rd Cir. 1995). In addition, ""[f]raudulent 
intent may be inferred from the modus operandi of the scheme."" United States v. Reid, 533 F.2d 1255, 1264, 175 
U.S. App. D.C. 120 (D.C. Cir. 1976). Fraudulent intent may also be proven by inference from the totality of the 
circumstances, including by indirect or circumstantial evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Alston, 609 F.2d 531, 
538, 197 U.S. App. D.C. 276 (D.C. Cir. 1979) (totality of the circumstances); United States v. Sawyer, 85 F.3d 713, 
733 (1st Cir. 1996) (indirect and circumstantial evidence).
In this case, evidence of the existence and methods of the Enterprise's overall scheme to defraud and Defendants' 
individual roles in that Enterprise — including each Defendant's purposeful and conscious actions taken in light of 
its collective knowledge — reveals a ""cumulative pattern"" of decisions, actions, and inaction that is powerful 
circumstantial evidence of specific fraudulent intent. See In re WorldCom, Inc. Sec. Litig., 352 F. Supp. 2d at 499. 
The Findings of Fact overwhelmingly demonstrate that Defendants took deliberate steps to protect, 
execute, [*2457]  and further the fraudulent scheme by making statements that they knew were not true. Again, to 
give but one example, the members of the Tobacco Institute Executive Committee, comprised of cigarette company 
Defendants' executives, approved TI communications directed to the public that promoted the fraudulent position 
that there was an ""open question"" regarding whether smoking or nicotine is addictive. At the same time, each of 
those executives' companies had knowledge both that smoking and nicotine are addictive and that smoking causes 
disease. See Findings of Fact Section V(B)(3). In the majority of instances, the authors of the fraudulent statements 
alleged as Racketeering Acts were executives, including high level scientists — CEOs, Vice Presidents, Heads of 
Research & Development, not entry level employees -- at each of the Defendant companies who would reasonably 
be expected to have knowledge of the company's internal research, public positions, and long term strategies.
In addition, Defendants' representatives' reckless disregard for the truth of their public statements about the health 
effects of smoking, smoking and nicotine addiction, and other smoking and health issues similarly [*2458]  
establishes specific intent to defraud. Numerous documents from the 1950s forward show Defendants' recognition 
that their internal understanding of smoking's adverse health effects and the addictiveness of nicotine contradicted 
the position they took with smokers, potential smokers, and the American public. See, e.g., (no bates) (US 21794) 
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118375, *2454

 
(internal memo of Philip Morris nicotine researcher acknowledging that nicotine is a drug while noting Philip Morris's 
policy that ""we must be officially heedless of the drug properties of nicotine""). Time after time, Defendants' 
executives and policy-makers chose courses of action intended to preserve the chasm between internally recorded 
facts and knowledge and externally professed ignorance and denial. Further, there is substantial evidence in the 
record that over the years, numerous executives and scientists of Defendants participated actively in the oversight 
and control of industry activities that were calculated to advance their fraudulent scheme. For instance, the Chief 
Executive Officers of Philip Morris, Reynolds, B&W, Lorillard, American, and Liggett, served on the Board of 
Directors and/or the Executive Committee of the Tobacco Institute. [*2459]  The General Counsels of the Cigarette 
Company Defendants were members of the Committee of Counsel. The Boards of Directors of CTR and CIAR were 
comprised of employees of Defendants. Furthermore, Defendants actively supported, both with funding and 
manpower, the numerous other bodies whose structures, functions, and activities are described throughout the 
Findings of Fact.
Accordingly, the specific intent required for liability under 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341 and 1343 is demonstrated by each 
Defendant's public statements and representations, its collective knowledge and the collective knowledge of the 
Enterprise of which it was a part, and its willful disregard of that knowledge.
5. Defendants' False and Fraudulent Statements, Representations, and Promises Were Material
Materiality is a fundamental element of common law fraud. See Neder v. United States, 527 U.S. 1, 22, 119 S. Ct. 
1827, 144 L. Ed. 2d 35 (1999). A matter is material if:
(a) a reasonable [person] would attach importance to its existence or nonexistence in determining his [or her] 
choice of action in the transaction in question; or
(b) the maker of the representation knows or has reason to know that its recipient regards or is likely to regard 
the matter as important in determining his [or her] choice of action, although a reasonable [*2460]  [person] 
would not so regard it.
Restatement (Second) of Torts, § 538(2)(a)-(b) (1977).35
With respect to the second prong of the Restatement's definition of materiality, the D.C. Circuit has explained that a 
fraudulent scheme can exist even when ""no reasonable [prudent] person would have believed [the defendant's] 
misrepresentations . . . [or] where [people] unreasonably believed the representations made to them."" United Stated 
v. Maxwell, 920 F.2d 1028, 1036 (D.C. Cir. 1990). Instead, ""the only issue is whether there is a plan, scheme or 
artifice intended to defraud."" Id. at 1036 (quoting United States v. Brien, 617 F.2d 299, 311 (1st Cir. 1980)).
Although this Circuit emphasizes the second clause of the Restatement definition, this Court concludes that 
Defendants' statements qualify as material under both clauses. First, Defendants' assertion that no reasonably 
prudent consumer would have relied upon or believed their fraudulent misrepresentations, because of contrary 
information available in the public domain, strains credulity. For much of the period during which the alleged 
35 It is noteworthy that cases involving the FTC's determinations of materiality are consistent with the Court's finding here, even 
though such cases are brought pursuant to the FTC Act rather than the RICO statute. As a general rule, deceptive advertising or 
claims permit an inference ""that the deception will constitute a material factor in a purchaser's decision to buy."" FTC v. Colgate-
Palmolive Co., 380 U.S. 374, 391-92, 85 S. Ct. 1035, 13 L. Ed. 2d 904 (1965); see also FTC v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco 
Corp., 778 F.2d 35, 40-43, 250 U.S. App. D.C. 162 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (holding that deceptive advertising touting Defendants' low 
tar cigarettes created an ""inherent tendency to deceive"" consumers and was material); FTC v. Wilcox, 926 F. Supp. 1091, 1098 
(S.D. Fla. 1995) (""Express claims or deliberately-made implied claims used to induce the purchase of a particular product or 
service are presumed to be material""). Moreover, materiality is presumed for matters that ""significantly involve health, safety, or 
other areas with which the reasonable consumer would be concerned."" Novartis Corp. v. FTC, 223 F.3d 783, 786, 343 U.S. App. 
D.C. 111 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (quoting Deception Statement, 103 FTC at 182); see also Kraft, Inc. v. FTC, 970 F.2d 311, 322 (7th 
Cir. 1992).
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118375, *2458

 
racketeering acts took place, Defendants were the primary source of information regarding cigarette smoking and 
tobacco addiction. See e.g., Findings of Fact at Section V(B)(2)(b). The public health community had a far less 
sophisticated understanding of the health hazards [*2461]  associated with smoking and for fewer resources to 
disseminate the information it did have. See id. It would have been reasonable, therefore, for consumers to believe 
that Defendants' statements accurately reflected current knowledge about the dangers of smoking.
In addition, one can only wonder just why Defendants were spending millions upon millions of dollars in advertising 
every year if they thought no one -- smoker, potential smoker, or member of the public -- was going to believe it and 
rely on it. The question answers itself. Moreover, Defendants knew, as their many internal documents reveal, just 
how badly ordinary smokers addicted to nicotine did not want to believe, in the early days, that smoking was 
disastrous for their health and then as the evidence mounted, wanted to believe that they could smoke low tar light 
cigarettes and not sacrifice their health. For Defendants to now deny that the ""disinformation"" they were spending 
millions on to deceive the public would not have been of import to a reasonable person in determining his or her 
choice of action is the height of disingenuousness. Thus, Defendants' statements were material under the 
""reasonable person"" standard of [*2462]  the Restatement's definition of materiality.
Second, the Government has produced ample and convincing evidence to show that Defendants' statements were 
material under the second clause of the Restatement definition as well. Many of Defendants' statements were made 
with the intention to mislead the public. See generally Findings of Fact. For example, shortly after issuance of the 
Surgeon General's Report on secondhand smoke, Philip Morris advertisements featured smokers ""talking"" to the 
reader and asserting, ""Please don't tell me my cigarette smoke is harmful to you. There's just no convincing proof 
that it is,"" and ""I know there's no proof my smoke can hurt you."" (no bates) (US 20554). Defendants' internal 
documents demonstrate that they expressly recognized that their customers were ""likely to regard [these fraudulent 
misrepresentations] as important in determining [their] choice of action,"" Restatement (Second) of Torts, § 
538(2)(b). See id. at 67-69 & n.4; Order # 235, Mem. Op. at 2. Defendants' conduct is, therefore, material under the 
second prong of the Restatement definition because Defendants knew that consumers would rely on their 
advertising and marketing when determining whether to smoke cigarettes.
Defendants attempt to show [*2463]  that their statements were not material by defining a ""material statement"" as 
one that ""must 'be of importance to a reasonable person in making a decision about a particular matter or 
transaction.'"" Defs.' Corrected Post-Trial Brief at 23 (citing United States v. Winstead, 74 F.3d 1313, 1320, 316 U.S. 
App. D.C. 52 (D.C. Cir. 1996). Under that definition, Defendants claim, that their statements could only be material if 
they were ""of that type that reasonable consumers would take into account in purchasing cigarettes."" Id. at 73. 
Applying their narrow definition of materiality, Defendants allege, first, that the Government cannot show that 
consumers relied on Defendants' statements when considering to purchase cigarettes, see id. at 68, and, second, 
that the public had reached a ""saturation"" level of awareness about smoking and ""universally disbelieved"" 
statements by Defendants. See id. at 74.
As the Government notes in its brief, however, Defendants' definition of materiality, which focuses solely on the 
""reasonable person"" standard, is insufficient. See Govt Post-Trial Brief at 11. Defendants' liability does not hinge 
solely upon whether their statements ""[were of the type that] reasonable consumers would take into account,"" Defs.' 
Corrected Post-Trial Brief at 73, but also on whether ""[Defendants'] [*2464]  ""knew or [had] reason to know that 
[consumers of tobacco products] regard[ed] or [were] likely to regard [Defendants' statements] as important in [their 
decision to smoke cigarettes],"" Restatement (Second) of Torts § 538 (2)(b). Contrary to Defendants' assertions, the 
evidence here demonstrates that their statements are material under both the Restatement tests.36
36 Defendants also may not escape liability for their scheme to defraud by claiming that the public was not injured by their 
misconduct. To establish a mail or wire fraud violation, a plaintiff is not required to prove that: (1) the wrongdoer succeeded in 
deceiving or defrauding the intended victim; (2) the victim suffered any loss of money, property, or other harm; or (3) the 
intended victim detrimentally relied upon the wrongdoer's fraudulent misconduct. See Philip Morris, 304 F. Supp. 2d at 69-70; 
Philip Morris, 116 F. Supp. 2d at 153; Philip Morris, 273 F. Supp. 2d at 6. Thus, ""the common-law requirements of justifiable 
reliance and damages . . . plainly have no place in the federal statutes."" Neder, 527 U.S. at 24-25.
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118375, *2460

 
Defendants' attempts to prove that consumers disregarded or disbelieved their statements about the safety hazards 
associated with smoking are not to be believed. See Defs.' Corrected Post-Trial Brief at 68, 74. The clear weight of 
the evidence shows that Defendants took advantage of and exploited their customers' lack of knowledge 
concerning cigarette use and nicotine addiction. Thus, Defendants' statements were material to consumers of 
tobacco products and to others, such as the recipients of secondhand smoke, who were affected by Defendants' 
products.
For all the foregoing reasons, the Court concludes that Defendants are liable for violations of 18 U.S.C. § 
1962(D).37
VIII. DEFENDANTS HAVE VIOLATED 18 U.S.C. §1962(d)
18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) provides in part: ""It shall be unlawful for any person to conspire to violate any of the provisions 
of . . . Subsection (c) of this Section.""
A. Applicable Case Law
To establish [*2465]  a conspiracy violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d), the United States must prove each of the 
following elements:
1. The existence of an enterprise;
2. That the enterprise was engaged in, or its activities affected, interstate or foreign commerce; and
3. That each defendant knowingly agreed to the commission of a violation of 18 U.S.C. 1962(c).38
See, e.g., Salinas v. United States, 522 U.S. 52, 62-65, 118 S. Ct. 469, 139 L. Ed. 2d 352 (1997); United States v. 
Philip Morris Inc., 130 F. Supp. 2d 96, 100 (D.D.C. 2001); United States v. Posada-Rios, 158 F.3d 832, 857 (5th 
Cir. 1998); United States v. To, 144 F.3d 737, 744 (11th Cir. 1998); Jones v. Meridian Towers Apartments, Inc., 816 
F. Supp. 762, 772-73 (D.D.C. 1993).
37 Before trial in this case, Defendants raised a number of affirmative defenses. The Court granted the Government's Motion for 
Partial Summary Judgment for these defenses as to liability. See Order #476; see also Order #227, #356, #509, #538, and 
#586. However, at that time the Court reserved judgment about how these affirmative defenses might apply to remedies. See 
Mem. Op. to Order #476 at 27 n.21. Defendants now appropriately raise the same affirmative defenses in regard to remedies.
Repeating the arguments from their pre-trial brief, Defendants again assert that waiver, laches, unclean hands, in pari delicto, 
and equitable estoppel bar any claim for relief by the Government. See Defs.'Post-Trial Br. on Affirmative Defenses 18, Sept. 7, 
2005. As in the pre-trial brief on affirmative defenses, Defendants' make the broad argument that because the Federal Trade 
Commission has had an historical role regulating tobacco products, the Court cannot grant the Government any relief in this 
action. See Defs.' Post-Trial Reply Br. in Support of Their Affirmative Defenses 1, Sept. 29, 2005. In previously rejecting this 
theory and Defendants' affirmative defenses in regards to liabilities, this Court found that, ""the case law overwhelmingly supports 
the Government's position"" that the enumerated equitable defenses may not be asserted against the United States ""when, as 
here, 'it is acting in its sovereign capacity to exercise public rights to protect the public interest.'"" United States v. Philip Morris, 
Inc., 300 F. Supp. 2d 65-66 (D.D.C. 2004) (internal citations omitted).
Significantly, the facts have not changed since Defendants asked this Court to rule on affirmative defenses in the liability stage 
of this matter. Furthermore, Defendants have not put forth any new arguments or cited any new precedent for why the Court 
should rule in favor of the affirmative defenses they now re-raise as to remedies. Therefore, this Court finds that the affirmative 
defenses now re-raised by Defendants as to remedies do not preclude the United States from obtaining relief.
38 The first two elements are also required to establish the substantive RICO violation, which has been addressed supra, in 
Sections VII(C) and (D).
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118375, *2464

 
Although a substantive RICO offense under § 1962(c), requires proof that each defendant committed at least two 
racketeering acts, a RICO conspiracy charge does not require proof of the actual commission of any racketeering 
act or any overt act. See, e.g., Salinas, 522 U.S. at 63; United States v. Zauber, 857 F.2d 137, 148 (3d Cir. 1988); 
United States v. Caporale, 806 F.2d 1487, 1515 (11th Cir. 1986); United States v. Teitler, 802 F.2d 606, 612-13 (2d 
Cir. 1986) (collecting cases); United States v. Neapolitan, 791 F.2d 489, 498 (7th Cir. 1986); United States v. 
Adams, 759 F.2d 1099, 1116 (3d Cir. 1985); United States v. Brooklier, 685 F.2d 1208, 1222-23 (9th Cir. 1982); 
United States v. Corrado, 286 F.3d 934, 937 (6th Cir. 2002); Glecier, 923 F.2d at 500; Gonzalez, 921 F.2d at 1547-
48; United States v. Torres Lopez, 851 F.2d 520, 525 (1st Cir. 1988); United States v. Persico, 832 F.2d 705, 713 
(2d Cir. 1987).
As the Supreme Court explained in Salinas, ""[t]he RICO conspiracy provision, then, is even more comprehensive 
than the general conspiracy offense in [18 U.S.C.] § 371."" 522 U.S. at 63. As in the case of conventional conspiracy 
offenses, each co-conspirator is liable for the acts of all other conspirators undertaken in furtherance of the 
conspiracy both prior to and subsequent to the co-conspirator's joining the conspiracy. See, e.g., Salinas, 522 U.S. 
at 63-64; P & B Autobody, 43 F.3d at 1562; Pungitore, 910 F. 2d at 1145-48; United States v. Bridgeman, 523 F.2d 
1099, 1108, 173 U.S. App. D.C. 150 (D.C. Cir. 1975).
Moreover, the existence of a conspiracy is not disproved merely because its membership changes over time or 
some defendants cease to participate in it. See, e.g., United States v. Garcia, 785 F.2d 214, 225 (8th Cir. 1986) 
(""An agreement [*2466]  may include the performance of many transactions, and new parties may join or old parties 
terminate their relationship with the conspiracy at any time.""); United States v. Warner, 690 F.2d 545, 549 n.7 (6th 
Cir. 1982); United States v. Varelli, 407 F.2d 735, 742 (7th Cir. 1969); United States v. Boyd, 595 F.2d 120, 123 (3d 
Cir. 1978); United States v. Klein, 515 F.2d 751 (3d Cir. 1975); United States v. Bates, 600 F.2d 505, 509 (5th Cir. 
1979) (""Nor does a single conspiracy become several merely because of personnel changes.""); United States v. 
Michel, 588 F.2d 986 (5th Cir. 1979); United States v. Lemm, 680 F.2d 1193, 1199 (8th Cir. 1982) (for RICO 
conspiracy, continuity may be met even with changes in personnel or even when different individuals manage the 
affairs of the enterprise); United States v. Tillett, 763 F.2d 628, 631-32 (4th Cir. 1985) (personnel change does not 
prevent RICO conspiracy); United States v. Bello-Perez, 977 F.2d 664, 668 (1st Cir. 1992) (""What was essential is 
that the criminal 'goal or overall plan' have persisted without fundamental alteration, notwithstanding variations in 
personnel and their roles.""); United States v. Kelley, 849 F.2d 999, 1003 (6th Cir. 1988) (single conspiracy can be 
found even where ""the cast of characters changed over the course of the enterprise""); United States v. Nasse, 432 
F.2d 1293, 1297 (7th Cir. 1970); United States v. Sepulvedam, 15 F.3d 1161, 1191 (1st Cir. 1993) (""in a unitary 
conspiracy it is not necessary that the membership remain static"") (citing United States v. Perholtz, 842 F.2d 343, 
364, 268 U.S. App. D.C. 347 (D.C. Cir. 1988)); United States v. Bryant, 364 F.2d 598, 603 (4th Cir. 1966) (""The 
addition of new members to a conspiracy or the withdrawal of old ones from it does not change the status of the 
other conspirators."") (quoting Poliafico v. United States, 237 F.2d 97, 104 (6th Cir. 1956)); United States v. Shorter, 
54 F.3d 1248 (7th Cir. 1995).
In addition, even if one conspirator did not participate in, or was unaware of, acts undertaken by co-conspirators in 
furtherance of the conspiracy, it is nevertheless liable for such acts, including those that [*2467]  occur prior to its 
joining the conspiracy. See, e.g., Salinas v. United States, 522 U.S. 52, 63-64, 118 S. Ct. 469, 139 L. Ed. 2d 352 
(1997); Pinkerton v. United States, 328 U.S. 640, 646-47, 66 S. Ct. 1180, 90 L. Ed. 1489 (1996); United States v. 
Starrett, 55 F.3d 1525, 1544 (11th Cir. 1995); Aetna Cas. Sur. Co. v. P & B Autobody, 43 F.3d 1546, 1562 (1st Cir. 
1994); United States v. Rosenthal, 793 F.2d 1214, 1228 (11th Cir. 1986); United States v. Pungitore, 910 F. 2d 
1084, 1145-48 (3d Cir. 1990); United States v. Bridgeman, 523 F.2d 1099, 1108, 173 U.S. App. D.C. 150 (D.C. Cir. 
1975). Such liability remains even if the defendant has ceased his participation in the conspiracy. See, e.g., United 
States v. Thomas, 114 F.3d 228, 267-68, 324 U.S. App. D.C. 374 (D.C. Cir. 1997); In Re Corrugated Container

B. Each Defendant 39 Is Liable for the RICO Conspiracy Charge Because Each Entered into the Requisite 
Conspiratorial Agreement
""In order to be guilty of a RICO conspiracy, a defendant must either agree to [individually] commit two predicate 
acts or agree to participate in the conduct of the enterprise with the knowledge and intent that other members of the 
conspiracy would commit at least two predicate acts in furtherance of the enterprise."" United States v. Nguyen, 255 
F.3d 1335, 1341 (11th Cir. 2001); see also United States v. Abbell, 271 F.3d 1286, 1299 (11th Cir. 2001); Brouwer 
v. Raffensperger, Hughes & Co., 199 F.3d 961, 964 (7th Cir. 2000); To, 144 F.3d at 744; United States v. Brazel, 
102 F.3d 1120, 1138 (11th Cir. 1997); United States v. Shenberg, 89 F.3d 1461, 1471 (11th Cir. 1996). Defendants 
are liable for a RICO conspiracy under either test.
First, each Defendant individually agreed to commit at least two Racketeering Acts. The overwhelming evidence 
demonstrates that each Defendant personally committed numerous Racketeering Acts in furtherance of the affairs 
of the Enterprise. See Findings of Fact Section VII(G)(3)(a), supra. ""Where, as here, the evidence establishes that 
each defendant, over a period of years, committed several acts of racketeering activity in furtherance of the 
enterprise's affairs, the inference of [*2468]  an agreement to do so is unmistakable."" Elliott, 571 F.2d at 903; see 
also United States v. Ashman, 979 F.2d 469, 492 (7th Cir. 1992); United States v. Crockett, 979 F.2d 1204, 1218 
(7th Cir. 1991); United States v. Carlock, 806 F.2d at 547 (5th Cir. 1986); United States v. Melton, 689 F.2d 679, 
683 (7th Cir. 1982); United States v. Sutherland, 656 F.2d 1181, 1187 n.4 (5th Cir. 1981).
Second, each Defendant agreed to participate in the conduct of the Enterprise with the knowledge and intent that 
other members of the conspiracy would also commit at least two predicate acts in furtherance of the Enterprise. A 
RICO conspiracy may exist even if a conspirator does not agree to commit or facilitate each and every part of the 
substantive offense. See United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. 150, 253-254, 60 S. Ct. 811, 84 L. Ed. 
1129 (1940). As the Supreme Court explained in reference to RICO:
A conspirator must intend to further an endeavor which, if completed, would satisfy all of the elements of a 
substantive criminal offense, but it suffices that he adopt the goal of furthering or facilitating the criminal 
endeavor. He may do so in any number of ways short of agreeing to undertake all of the acts necessary for the 
crime's completion. One can be a conspirator by agreeing to facilitate only some of the acts leading to the 
substantive offense. It is elementary that a conspiracy may exist and be punished whether or not the 
substantive crime ensues. . . .
* * *
It makes no difference that the substantive offense under § 1962(c) requires two or more predicate acts. The 
interplay between subsections (c) and (d) does not permit us to [*2469]  excuse from the reach of the 
conspiracy provision an actor who does not himself commit or agree to commit the two or more predicate acts 
requisite to the underlying offense.
Salinas, 522 U.S. at 63-65.
Thus, to prove a RICO conspiracy,
[t]he focus is on the agreement to participate in the enterprise through the pattern of racketeering activity, not 
on the agreement to commit the individual predicate acts. . . . The government can prove [such] an agreement 
on an overall objective by circumstantial evidence showing that each defendant must necessarily have known 
that others were also conspiring to participate in the same enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity.
Starrett, 55 F.3d at 1543-44 (internal quotations and citations omitted); Accord Posada-Rios, 158 F.3d at 857; To, 
144 F.3d at 744. It is sufficient ""that the defendant agree to the commission of [at least] two predicate acts [by any 
conspirator] on behalf of the conspiracy."" MCM Partners, Inc. v. Andrews-Bartlett & Assocs., 62 F.3d 967, 980 (7th 
39 As discussed in great detail, infra at Section VIII(C), Liggett withdrew from the conspiracy in 1997. Accordingly, Liggett is not 
liable as a conspirator for any acts that occurred subsequent to 1997.

Cir. 1995) (quoting United States v. Neapolitan, 791 F.2d 489, 498 (7th Cir. 1986)). Accord Brouwer, 199 F.3d at 
964; United States v. Quintanilla, 2 F.3d 1469, 1484 (7th Cir. 1993) (quoting Neapolitan).
Defendants' conspiracy was in existence as of December 1953, when several of the cigarette company Defendants 
met in New York City to create CTR and to discuss and outline the Enterprise's future strategy.40 Each Defendant 
agreed to commit a substantive RICO offense with the knowledge that other members [*2470]  of the Enterprise 
were also conspiring to commit racketeering activity. All Defendants coordinated significant aspects of their public 
relations, scientific, legal, and marketing activity in furtherance of the shared objective -- to use mail and wire 
transmissions to maximize industry profits by preserving and expanding the market for cigarettes through a scheme 
to deceive the public. Defendants executed the scheme by using several different strategies including: (1) denying 
that there were adverse health effects from smoking; (2) making false, misleading, and deceptive public statements 
designed to maintain doubt about whether smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke cause disease; (3) 
denying the addictiveness of smoking cigarettes and the role of nicotine therein; (4) disseminating advertising for 
light and low tar cigarettes suggesting they were less harmful than full flavor ones; and (5) undertaking a publicly 
announced duty to conduct and publicize disinterested and independent research into the health effects of smoking 
upon which the public could rely. See Findings of Fact Sections III and V.
Moreover, the cigarette company Defendants jointly participated at various times and [*2471]  to various degrees in 
creating, funding, directing and controlling Defendants CTR, TI and other entities and causing Defendants CTR and 
TI to commit numerous racketeering acts to further those shared objectives. Furthermore, the frequent oral and 
written communications between and among Defendants illustrate their joint efforts to pursue their shared 
objectives. Significantly, Defendants worked together continuously, in many different venues and through many 
different entities, to disseminate their agreed upon deceptive public position denying the link between smoking 
cigarettes and adverse health effects, denying the addictiveness of smoking cigarettes and nicotine, and denying 
their marketing of cigarettes to young people. See Findings of Fact Sections V(A, B, F).
In addition, each Defendant also agreed to facilitate the substantive RICO violation by concealing or suppressing 
information and documents which may have been detrimental to the interests of the members of the Enterprise. 
Such information might well have been discoverable in smoking and health liability cases against Defendants and 
therefore could have constituted, or led to, evidence of the link between smoking cigarettes, [*2472]  addiction, and 
adverse health effects. See Findings of Fact Section V(H).
Thus, each Defendant knew the goals of the Enterprise, the general nature of the conspiracy, and that other 
members of the conspiracy would commit at least two Racketeering Acts in furtherance of the Enterprise's scheme 
to defraud. Indeed, each Defendant took substantial steps to facilitate the scheme to defraud that was the central 
purpose of the conspiracy, including committing numerous Racketeering Acts in furtherance of the Enterprise's 
affairs. Hence, each Defendant entered into the requisite conspiratorial agreement. Accord Salinas, 522 U.S. at 66 
(""[E]ven if Salinas did not accept or agree to accept two bribes, there was ample evidence that he conspired to 
violate subsection (c). The evidence showed that [Salinas' conspirator] committed at least two acts of racketeering 
activity when he accepted numerous bribes and that Salinas knew about and agreed to facilitate the scheme. This 
is sufficient to support a conviction under § 1962(d)."").
While there is much explicit evidence of actual agreement between Defendants in the Findings of Fact, RICO 
liability does not require such an explicit agreement. ""Regardless of the method used to prove the 
agreement, [*2473]  the government does not have to establish that each conspirator explicitly agreed with every 
other conspirator to commit the substantive RICO crime described in the indictment, or knew his fellow 
conspirators, or was aware of all the details of the conspiracy."" Starrett, 55 F.3d at 1544 (internal quotations and 
citations deleted).
Even though the criminal activities may differ, they must still be linked to allow the inference of an agreement. 
United States v. Boylan, 898 F.2d 230, 242 (1st Cir. 1990) (RICO conspiracy conviction upheld where ""the

defendants and their activities were nothing short of striking: each defendant was a detective assigned to work 
nights in District 4 at some time during the indictment period; each received things of value, usually cash, from 
restaurant or nightclub owners in exchange for services not officially sanctioned; the targeted establishments were 
all in District 4 and all under the Board's aegis. Moreover, there was a significant degree of interconnectedness. 
The defendants often cooperated with one another in collecting payments and in providing their specialized 
services. These common characteristics are precisely the kind of factors which can permissibly lead to the 
inference of a single conspiracy.""); Ashman, 979 F.2d at 492 (in investment scheme, [*2474]  evidence sufficient for 
RICO conspiracy where defendants served as ""bag men"" for each other, used similar procedures for covering 
losses, and ""were well aware that they were part of an ongoing and flexible agreement to commit fraud as the need 
-- or perhaps the opportunity -- arose""); see also United States v. Zichettello, 208 F.3d 72, 100 (2d Cir. 2000); To, 
144 F.3d at 744; United States v. Ruiz, 905 F.2d 499, 505 (1st Cir. 1990); Rastelli, 870 F.2d at 828 (collecting 
cases); United States v. Rosenthal, 793 F.2d 1214, 1228 (11th Cir. 1986); United States v. De Peri, 778 F.2d 963, 
975 (3d Cir. 1985); Elliott, 571 F.2d at 902-03.
To establish sufficient knowledge, it is only required that the defendant ""know the general nature of the conspiracy 
and that the conspiracy extends beyond his individual role."" Rastelli, 870 F.2d at 828 (collecting cases). Accord 
Zichettello, 208 F.3d at 100; Brazel, 102 F.3d at 1138; Eufrasio, 935 F.2d at 577 n.29; Rosenthal, 793 F.2d at 1228; 
De Peri, 778 F.2d at 975; Elliott, 571 F.2d at 903-04. Furthermore, ""[b]ecause conspirators normally attempt to 
conceal their conduct, the elements of a conspiracy offense may be established solely by circumstantial evidence. . 
. . The agreement, a defendant's guilty knowledge and a defendant's participation in the conspiracy all may be 
inferred from the development and collocation of circumstances."" Posada-Rios, 158 F.3d at 857 (citations and 
internal quotations omitted).
For all the foregoing reasons, the Court concludes that Defendants are liable for conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. § 
1962(d) of RICO because they both explicitly and implicitly agreed to violate 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) of RICO.41
C. Liggett Withdrew from the Conspiracy
Where an alleged conspirator communicates his abandonment in a manner reasonably calculated to reach co-
conspirators, the conspirator is deemed to have withdrawn from the conspiracy. United States v. Thomas, 114 F.3d 
228, 267-9, 324 U.S. App. D.C. 374 (D.C. Cir.), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 1033 (1997) (collecting cases); see also 
United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 438 U.S. 422, 463-64, 98 S. Ct. 2864, 57 L. Ed. 2d 854 (1978); In re 
Brand Name Prescription Drugs Antitrust Litig., 123 F.3d 599, 616 (7th Cir. 1978); In re Corrugated Container 
Antitrust Litig., 662 F.2d 875, 886, 213 U.S. App. D.C. 319 (D.C. Cir. 1981). Although there is clear and convincing 
evidence that Liggett participated in the RICO Enterprise and conspiracy during its formative years, the Court finds 
that it withdrew from the conspiracy in 1997.
In 1996, Liggett broke ranks with the tobacco industry when it cooperated with states' Attorneys General in the 
prosecution of certain claims against itself and other tobacco company Defendants, and made historic statements 
concerning the health and addiction risks of smoking. See Findings of Fact Section VIII(C). Liggett's invaluable 
cooperation with government authorities and public health officials was well-publicized. Id. The states' [*2476]  
41 Contrary to Altria's claim, the prohibition against intracorporate conspiracies under the antitrust laws does not apply to this 
case. In Ashland Oil, Inc. v. Arnett, 875 F.2d 1271 (7th Cir. 1989), the Seventh Circuit explained:
Since a subsidiary and its parent theoretically have a community of interest, a conspiracy [*2475]  ""in restraint of trade"" 
between them poses no threat to the goals of antitrust law — protecting competition. In contrast, intracorporate 
conspiracies do threaten RICO's goals of preventing the infiltration of legitimate businesses by racketeers and separating 
racketeers from their profits.
875 F.2d at 1281 (citations omitted). Accordingly, because Altria conspired to violate 18 U.S.C. §1962(c), it is liable under RICO 
conspiracy, even though one of the Defendants with which Altria conspired was Philip Morris USA, Altria's subsidiary.
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118375, *2473

 
Attorneys General, as well as numerous other government and public health officials, publicly acknowledged that 
Liggett's conduct and cooperation was a key element in achieving important settlements with other major tobacco 
companies, including the Master Settlement Agreement.
There were several ways in which Liggett provided cooperation and assistance to the states' Attorneys General in 
their continuing lawsuits against the major tobacco companies. Liggett agreed to waive attorney-client privilege and 
work product protection with respect to internal Liggett-only privileged documents relevant to smoking and health 
issues and produced such documents to the states. As to joint defense privileged documents in Liggett's 
possession, Liggett produced many of those documents to courts around the country for in camera reviews and 
Liggett's outside counsel participated in efforts to have such documents de-privileged. These productions resulted 
in the first judicial decisions compelling the major tobacco companies to release privileged documents. Liggett also 
agreed to make its scientists and executives available for informational interviews by the Attorneys General and 
their outside counsel [*2477]  and conducted informational tours of Liggett's manufacturing facilities for counsel for 
the states and others in the public health community. Finally, Bennet LeBow, CEO of Liggett at the time, and others 
affiliated with Liggett testified on behalf of the states' Attorneys General in those cases where trials occurred. Id. at 
5:6-19. As a result of these and other actions in 1996 and 1997, Liggett has isolated itself, and been isolated from, 
the other cigarette company Defendants. In this case, Liggett was represented by its own individual counsel and 
conducted its own defense.
Liggett communicated its withdrawal from the Enterprise and the conspiracy by, among other things, its public 
statements and open cooperation with the state and federal governments in the prosecution of their claims against 
the other tobacco company Defendants. See Findings of Fact Section VIII(C). Given Liggett's conduct, the evidence 
shows Liggett is not continuing to ""conspire"" with other tobacco company defendants.42
IX. ALTRIA IS LIABLE FOR ITS VIOLATIONS OF 18 U.S.C. §1962(c) AND (d)
Defendants claim that Altria Group Inc., as a holding company, can not be liable for violations of 18 U.S.C. 1962 (c) 
and (d) simply by virtue of its parental relationship [*2478]  to Philip Morris USA. Their argument misses the point, 
since that is not the basis on which its liability rests. Since its creation in 1985, Altria, formerly Philip Morris 
Companies Inc., has participated directly in the conduct of the Enterprise and conspired to violate 1962(c). Even 
though there is overwhelming evidence that Altria effectively controlled Philip Morris USA and therefore ""caused"" 
some of its predicate Racketeering Acts, Altria's liability in this case stands on its own.
Defendant Altria effectively and actively controls the activities of all of its subsidiaries, including Defendant Philip 
Morris USA Inc. and Philip Morris International, Inc. Altria management sets overall policy on all major components 
of the companies' operations, and senior Altria executives, employees, and agents participate in and/or control 
decisions about how the operating companies should implement those policies, through both formal and informal 
reporting relationships. Berlind PD, U.S. v. Philip Morris, 5/23/02, 8:4-10:13; US 23061*. It is disingenuous to argue, 
as Altria does, that its control, through the reporting relationship, of decisions taken by Altria Corporate Services 
(""ACS"") employees [*2479]  on behalf of its subsidiaries does not constitute ""control"" of those decisions. Altria's 
relationship with its subsidiaries was structured to maintain consistency among its companies on sensitive issues 
such as smoking and health, addiction, and passive smoking. For example, the CEO and Chairman of Philip Morris 
42 Withdrawal does not preclude liability even in criminal prosecutions involving substantive mail and wire fraud offenses. For 
example, in United States v. Read, 658 F.2d 1225 (7th Cir. 1981), the Seventh Circuit explained the differences between the 
application of the withdrawal defense to substantive, as opposed to conspiracy, offenses. In holding that withdrawal was not a 
defense to substantive mail and securities fraud offenses, the court explained, ""A party's 'withdrawal' from a scheme is [] no 
defense to the crime because membership in the scheme is not an element of the offense. [The defendant] is liable for mail 
fraud as a principal or as an aider and abettor, not a conspirator."" Id. at 1240; accord United States v. Waldrop, 786 F.Supp. 
1194, 1201 (E.D. Pa. 1991) (""withdrawal is no defense to mail fraud""), aff'd, 983 F.2d 1054 (3d Cir. 1992) (Table). Accordingly, 
Liggett's withdrawal from the RICO conspiracy does not preclude its liability under 18 U.S.C. §1962(c) for the substantive mail 
and wire fraud offenses that underlie the civil RICO lawsuit for equitable relief brought by the United States.
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118375, *2475

 
Companies, Geoffrey Bible, was the ultimate authority on content of public statements on smoking and health made 
by Philip Morris Companies subsidiaries, including Philip Morris USA. Bible PD, U.S. v. Philip Morris, 8/22/02, 83:9-
84:9, 85:22-86:25. Moreover, the Court has already found that the document retention procedures and policies that 
led to the destruction of email by and to senior executives at Philip Morris while this lawsuit was pending were 
created with and approved by Altria. United States v. Philip Morris USA, 327 F. Supp. 2d 21, 24 (D.D.C. 2004).
Steven Parrish, Altria's Senior Vice President of Corporate Affairs, testified that officers and members of the Board 
of Directors of Altria were involved in activities of CTR and TI. Parrish TT, 1/27/05, 11349:8-11. Altria's General 
Counsel Murray Bring and William Murray, who served as President and COO of Altria and, later, Chairman of its 
Board of Directors, were members of the Board [*2480]  of Directors of CTR and attended its meetings. Id. at 
11350:6-12; (no bates) (US 32606); (no bates) (US 32608); (no bates) (US 32610). Alexander Holtzman, an 
attorney in the legal department at Altria, was also active in CTR leadership.
Altria's active participation extended to the Tobacco Institute. Parrish continued to attend meetings of the TI 
Executive Committee after leaving PM USA and joining the corporate affairs department at Altria. Parrish TT, 
1/27/05, 11352:24-11353:24; US 62461. Moreover, Altria's Vice-President of Government Affairs served as a Class 
A Director of TI, because ""the head of Government Affairs always sat on the TI Executive Committee."" Parrish TT, 
1/27/05, 11353:25-11354:25; (no bates) (US 88252); (no bates) (US 88308).
In addition, Parrish noted that Altria had approval authority for CTR Special Projects in the late 1980s and early 
1990s. Parrish TT, 1/27/05, 11351:20-11352:2. Altria (operating as Philip Morris Companies) issued checks to fund 
CTR Special Projects. Id. at 11352:3-23.
Accordingly, because Altria has participated in the Enterprise and conspiracy, both directly and indirectly, it cannot 
escape liability simply by virtue of being a holding company. [*2481] 
X. THERE IS A LIKELIHOOD OF PRESENT AND FUTURE VIOLATIONS OF RICO
A. Applicable Law
18 U.S.C. §1964 (a) limits the granting of remedies for liability under 1962(c) to those which ""prevent and restrain 
violations of section 1962. . . ."" As the D.C. Circuit explained, ""[t]his language indicates that the jurisdiction is limited 
to forward-looking remedies that are aimed at future violations."" United States v. Philip Morris USA Inc., 396 F.3d 
1190, 1198, 364 U.S. App. D.C. 454 (D.C. Cir 2004).
This Court has already held that:
To obtain injunctive relief in this Circuit, a plaintiff must show that the defendant's past unlawful conduct 
indicates a ""'reasonable likelihood of further violation(s) in the future.'"" SEC v. Kenton Capital, Ltd., 69 F. 
Supp.2d 1, 15 (D.D.C. 1998) (Kollar-Kotelly, J.) (quoting SEC v. Savoy Ind., Inc., 587 F.2d 1149, 1168, 190 
U.S. App. D.C. 252 (D.C. Cir. 1978)); SEC v. Bilzerian, 29 F.3d 689, 695, 308 U.S. App. D.C. 43 (D.C. 
Cir.1994).
To determine whether there is a ""reasonable likelihood"" of future violations, the following factors must be 
considered: ""[1] whether a defendant's violation was isolated or part of a pattern, [2]whether the violation was 
flagrant and deliberate or merely technical in nature, and [3] whether the defendant's business will present 
opportunities to violate the law in the future."" [SEC v. First City Financial Corp., 890 F.2d 1215, 1228, 281 U.S. 
App. D.C. 410 (D.C. Cir. 1989)] (citing Savoy Indus., 587 F.2d at 1168); Bilzerian, 29 F.3d at 695. None of 
these three factors is determinative; rather, ""the district court should determine the propensity for future 
violations based on the totality of circumstances."" First City, 890 F. 2d at 1228 (citing SEC v. Youmans, 729 
F.2d 413, 415 (6th Cir. 1984).
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118375, *2479

 
Philip Morris, Inc., 116 F. Supp. 2d at 148. In addition, [*2482]  the requisite ""reasonable likelihood"" of future 
violations may be established by inferences drawn from past conduct alone. Philip Morris USA, 316 F. Supp. 2d at 
10 n.3.
The Findings of Fact demonstrate that Defendants' conduct ""overwhelmingly satisfied each of the [D.C. Circuit's] 
three First City factors."" First City, 890 F.2d at 1228. First, Defendants' RICO violations were not ""isolated."" On the 
contrary, the Findings of Fact describes more than 100 predicate acts spanning more than a half-century. Second, 
Defendants' RICO violations were not ""technical in nature."" As discussed above, Defendants' numerous 
misstatements and acts of concealment and deception were made intentionally and deliberately, rather than 
accidentally or negligently, as part of a multi-faceted, sophisticated scheme to defraud. Third, as this Court has 
already found, Defendants' business of manufacturing, selling and marketing tobacco products ""present[s] 
opportunities to violate the law in the future."" Philip Morris, 116 F. Supp. 2d at 149 (alteration in original). As the 
Government points out, as long as Defendants are in the business of selling and marketing tobacco products, they 
will have countless ""opportunities"" and temptations to take similar unlawful actions in order to maximize their 
revenues, just as they [*2483]  have done for the past five decades.
Where, as here, the United States seeks equitable relief brought by the United States under 18 U.S.C. § 1964(a), 
""the government need not, as [Defendants] assert, demonstrate a new RICO violation to justify issuance of the 
injunction."" Local 560, 974 F.2d at 325 n.5 (""[Defendant] erroneously argues . . . that to succeed the government 
must prove a new RICO offense based on conduct which occurred after the March 16, 1984 Judgment Order""); see 
also United States v. Local 6A, Cement & Concrete Workers, 663 F. Supp. 192, 195 (S.D.N.Y. 1986) (rejecting 
argument that ""the Government must show present RICO violations to secure [injunctive] relief""). Instead, it is 
sufficient that the United States demonstrate a reasonable likelihood that the defendant might continue unlawful 
conduct in the future, which may be inferred from past conduct.43 In making that determination, the court does not 
begin ""with a clean slate"" as if it were ""a new case;"" rather, the court considers the totality of the evidence of the 
underlying case. United States v. Local 560, Int'l Bhd. of Teamsters, 754 F. Supp. 395, 403 (D.N.J. 1991). 
Moreover, a defendant remains liable for the continuation of events it conspired to set in motion, even if a particular 
defendant has ceased its unlawful activity. For the Court to enter injunctive remedies, there need only be a 
reasonable likelihood [*2484]  that the unlawful conduct set in motion by the conspirators will continue.
The evidence in this case clearly establishes that Defendants have not ceased engaging in unlawful activity. Even 
after the Complaint in this action was filed in September 1999, Defendants continued to engage in conduct that is 
materially indistinguishable from their previous actions, activity that continues to this day. For example, most 
Defendants continue to fraudulently deny the adverse health effects of secondhand smoke which they recognize 
internally; all Defendants continue to market ""low tar"" cigarettes to consumers seeking to reduce their health risks or 
quit; all Defendants continue to fraudulently deny that they manipulate the nicotine delivery of their cigarettes in 
order to create and sustain addiction; some Defendants continue to deny that they market to youth in publications 
with significant youth readership and with imagery that targets youth; and some Defendants continue to suppress 
and conceal information which might undermine their public or litigation positions. See generally Findings of Fact 
Section V. Significantly, their conduct continues [*2485]  to further the objectives of the overarching scheme to 
defraud, which began by at least 1953. Their continuing conduct misleads consumers in order to maximize 
Defendants' revenues by recruiting new smokers (the majority of whom are under the age of 18), preventing current 
smokers from quitting, and thereby sustaining the industry.
As Defendants' senior executives took the witness stand at trial, one after another, it became exceedingly clear that 
these Defendants have not, as they claim, ceased their wrongdoing or, as they argued throughout the trial, 
undertaken fundamental or permanent institutional change. For example, during live testimony in January 2005, 
43 See, e.g., United States v. Private Sanitation Indus. Ass'n, 995 F.2d 375, 377 (2d Cir. 1993); United States v. Local 30, United 
Slate, Tile & Composition Workers, 871 F.2d 401, 408-09 (3d Cir. 1989); United States v. Local 1804-1, Int'l Longshoremens 
Ass'n, 831 F. Supp. 177, 191 (S.D.N.Y. 1993); United States v. Local 295, Int'l Bhd. of Teamsters, 784 F. Supp. 15, 19-22 
(E.D.N.Y. 1992) (RICO injunction granted based upon evidence of past corruptions, and the court noted that ""[i]nstitutional 
practices and traditions tend to endure long after specific individuals are gone"") (id. at 19); Local 6A, 663 F. Supp. at 194-95.
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118375, *2481

 
more than forty years after the 1964 Surgeon General's Report, Reynolds American Executive Chairman Andrew 
Schindler refused to admit that smoking causes disease. Schindler TT, 1/24/05, 10812:3-22. Nevertheless, Joint 
Defendants assert in their post-trial Proposed Findings of Fact that ""Reynolds Concedes That Cigarette Smoking 
Causes Disease."" JD FF ch. 8, § V.G.4. In reality, the RJR website on which Joint Defendants rely in making that 
statement is only a half-hearted concession with the same two conditions that Schindler made [*2486]  in open 
court: ""R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company (R.J. Reynolds) believes that smoking, in combination with other factors, 
causes disease in some individuals."" March 18, 2005 RJR website printout (page 54 of 569) (JD 068012). The 
website minimizes smoking as being merely ""a risk factor for many chronic diseases,"" and states that ""[m]ost, if not 
all, chronic diseases result from the interaction of many risk factors including genetics, diet and lifestyle choices."" Id. 
44
RJR is not alone. Lorillard's CEO, Martin Orlowsky, likewise refused at trial to admit to the full extent of smoking's 
harm. He was asked, ""Why hasn't Lorillard specifically stated publicly that smoking causes any diseases other than 
smoking emphysema, COPD or heart disease?"" He responded: ""We have — in certain instances, we do not know if 
in fact the evidence, the scientific evidence is such that it warrants saying it does cause. However, Lorillard's 
longstanding position, as long as I've been with the company, is that certainly smoking can, and is a risk factor for 
those diseases."" Orlowsky TT, 10/13/04, 2303:7-15. Lorillard's website includes a July 28, 2003 press release, in 
which its general counsel Ronald Milstein falsely [*2487]  stated that, ""Research has shown time and time again 
that willpower is the only smoking cessation aid that always works."" (no bates) (US 86693). At trial, Milstein 
specifically refused to remove his statement from the website. Milstein TT, 1/7/05, 9288:12-19. He made those 
statements notwithstanding the fact that Defendants' internal documents indicate that they recognize that it is 
simply false that ""willpower . . . always works."" Clearly, then, any claim the Defendants have changed their behavior 
must be rejected.
B. The Enterprise's Scheme to Defraud Presents Continuing Opportunities for Defendants to Commit 
Violations of 18 U.S.C. 1962 (c) and (d)
There is a reasonable likelihood that Defendants' RICO violations will continue in most of the areas in which they 
have committed violations in the past. Defendants' practices have not materially changed in most of the Enterprise's 
activities, including: denial that ETS causes disease, denial that Defendants market to youth, denial of the 
addictiveness of nicotine, denial of manipulation of the design and content of cigarettes, suppression of information 
and research, and claims that light and low tar cigarettes are less hazardous than full-flavor cigarettes. [*2488] 
Philip Morris, BATCo, B&W, Lorillard, and RJR all deny in this lawsuit and in public statements that ETS causes 
disease in nonsmokers, contrary to the definitive scientific evidence and their own internal acknowledgments.45 As 
of August 2005, RJR's website asserted that it believes ""that there are still legitimate scientific questions concerning 
the reported risks of secondhand smoke."" (US 92012). Absent Court intervention, such denials and distortions of 
material health information and scientific evidence on ETS are, at a minimum, likely to continue.
44 Schindler acknowledged at trial that ""[i]f R.J. Reynolds wanted to convey the message on its Website that smoking causes 
disease, it could say that unequivocally,"" and that he could make it happen ""in a heartbeat,"" but he would not do so. Schindler 
TT, 1/24/05, 10816:25-10817:5, 10821:2-18.
45 From 1999-2001, the Philip Morris website publicly stated its disagreement with the scientific consensus as well:
Many scientists and regulators have concluded that ETS poses a health risk to nonsmokers. Even though we do not agree 
with many of their conclusions, below we have provided some links so you can access some of their views.
(no bates) (US 92056 at 2); Parrish TT, 11080:23-11082:14.
While this case was pending, Philip Morris revised its position on ETS to delete its disagreement with the conclusions of 
""scientists and regulators."" Philip Morris now states: ""Public health officials have concluded that secondhand smoke from 
cigarettes causes disease, including lung cancer and heart disease in nonsmoking adults"" as well as a number of adverse health 
effects in children. (no bates) (US 92055 at 1).
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118375, *2485

 
Similarly, Defendants continue to engage in many practices which target youth, and deny that they do so. Despite 
the provisions of the MSA, Defendants continue to track youth behavior and preferences and market to youth using 
imagery which appeals to the needs and desires of adolescents. Defendants are well aware that over eighty 
percent of adult smokers began smoking before the age of 18, and therefore know that securing [*2489]  the youth 
market is critical to their survival. There is therefore no reason, especially given their long history of denial and 
deceit, to trust their assurances that they will not continue committing RICO violations denying their marketing to 
youth.
Although Defendants recently began to finally admit that smoking is addictive, no Defendant publicly informs 
consumers that nicotine is addictive, much less that smoking is a nicotine-driven addiction. See Findings of Fact 
Section V(B)(4). Defendants minimize the issue as a ""quibble over the precise wording of the addictiveness of 
smoking."" JD Br. at 39. To the contrary, the issue is Defendants' refusal to admit publicly that nicotine is 
physiologically addictive, that smoking is a nicotine-driven addiction, and that, therefore, quitting is not a simple act 
of willpower. At trial, the General Counsel for Philip Morris, Denise Keane, admitted that the ""Smoking is Addictive"" 
statement that Philip Morris removed from cigarette packs after buying three Liggett cigarette brands in 1999 was 
both correct and material. She also agreed that it is material for people to know that Philip Morris agrees that the 
nicotine delivered in cigarette smoking [*2490]  is addictive, but it does not say so publicly. Keane TT, 1/18/05, 
10458:6-17. The deliberate omission of admittedly material information about nicotine addiction is not a mere 
""quibble."" It is fraudulent, with consequences for those who smoke and those, especially young people, who are 
considering whether to start smoking. Defendants have thus made clear that, despite their internal research to the 
contrary, they remain unwilling to admit publicly that nicotine is addictive and that smoking is an addiction driven by 
nicotine. Such RICO violations are reasonably likely to continue.
Defendants also continue to deny that they manipulate the design and content of cigarettes in order to assure 
adequate nicotine delivery to create and sustain smokers' addiction. Such RICO violations are reasonably likely to 
continue.
In addition, Defendants have a continuing interest in suppressing research and information and destroying 
documents which could prove detrimental to their public and litigation positions. Although it is difficult to prove such 
suppression or destruction, the Court strongly believes such RICO violations are reasonably likely to continue.
Contrary to their internal documents, Defendants [*2491]  also continue to deny that low tar cigarettes are just as 
hazardous to smokers as full-flavor cigarettes, in part because of smoker compensation. In 1998, Philip Morris, 
RJR, B&W, and Lorillard jointly stated to the FTC that compensation was so ""weakly documented"" that the FTC 
should not require disclosure warnings to alert consumers, and that they were ""unaware of evidence,"" other than 
that presented in Monograph 7, 520842199-2295 at 2243, 2289 (US 88618), that consumers viewed low-tar 
cigarettes as safer. Defendants are well aware from their own research that a majority of smokers believe that low-
tar cigarettes are healthier, are willing to buy them for precisely that reason, and are willing to sacrifice taste for 
what they believe to be less harmful cigarettes. Nonetheless, to this day, Defendants still deny that, as Monograph 
13 found, low-tar cigarettes are just as dangerous as full-flavor cigarettes. These RICO violations are likely to 
continue.
Finally, despite Defendants' claims that they have materially altered their management and are now ""new"" 
companies, the evidence demonstrates that they have not changed their policies or personnel in any meaningful 
way. For example, Philip [*2492]  Morris' current top executive staff is composed entirely of veteran employees with 
an average of fifteen to twenty years of company experience. The assertion that such longstanding, faithful 
employees will usher in dramatically new corporate policies seems reasonably unlikely.
C. The MSA Has Not Sufficiently Altered Defendants' Conduct to Justify Not Imposing Appropriate 
Remedies
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118375, *2488

 
While the MSA has made significant strides towards preventing Defendants' fraudulent activities, for several 
reasons it alone cannot remove the reasonable likelihood of Defendants' future RICO violations.46 As this Court has 
already noted:
In arguing that the MSA obviates the need for injunctive relief, Defendants implicitly ask the Court to make the 
following two assumptions: that Defendants have complied with and will continue to comply with the terms of 
the MSA, and that the MSA has adequate enforcement mechanisms in the event of noncompliance.
United States v. Philip Morris Inc., 116 F. Supp. 2d at 149 (D.D.C. 2000).
First, Defendants have not fully complied with the letter or spirit of the MSA. For example:
• Even in the core area of youth marketing, RJR did nothing to change its magazine placement policies after 
signing the MSA in November 1998 until [*2493]  the day that the California attorney general filed suit against it 
in March 2001 (in a suit which found that both RJR's initial and March 2001 policies violated the MSA). People 
ex rel. Lockyer v.R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 116 Cal. App. 4th 1253, 11 Cal. Rptr. 3d 317, 322-23 & n.3 (Cal. 
Ct. App. 2004). Indeed, the appellate court affirmed the trial court's determination that RJR ""'studiously 
avoided' measuring its advertising exposure to youth, probably because [it] 'knew the likely result of such 
analysis.'"" Id. at 327 (quoting trial court decision); see generally Findings of Fact Section VI(B)(2, 3).
• Likewise, after entering the MSA in November 1998, Lorillard did not change its principal ""Pleasure"" 
advertising campaign for Newport, the second-leading brand smoked among youth ages 12 to 17. Milstein TT, 
1/10/05, 9312:1-9314:9; 9417:18-9421:25, discussed in Findings of Fact Section VI(B)(3).
• Defendants increased price promotions more than seven-fold from 1998 to 2003 after the MSA banned 
outdoor and billboard ads, even though youth are particularly vulnerable to such price promotions.
• Defendants Philip Morris and Altria continue to sponsor two Marlboro motor sports teams which receive 
heavy media coverage in the United States, despite the MSA's limitation of one sports sponsorship per MSA 
signatory. They rationalize [*2494]  this on the grounds that Altria is officially not a signatory to the MSA, 
overlooking the fact that Philip Morris CEO and chairman Michael Szymanczyk sits on Altria's Corporate 
Management Committee, and that Philip Morris is, of course, a signatory to the MSA. See Findings of Fact 
Section VI(B)(2, 3).
• Despite the same limitation of one sponsorship per signatory, Philip Morris decided in 2001 to sponsor 
Marlboro race cars in two different auto racing leagues in 2001 -- the Indy Racing League and the CART racing 
league -- and then changed course immediately when Washington State attorney general Christine Gregoire 
protested, suggesting that Philip Morris was well aware that its decision violated the MSA. Id.
• Even though the MSA required Defendants to shut down and disband CIAR, Philip Morris has reconstituted it 
at the same address and with the same director, under the name of the Philip Morris External Research 
Program. Id.
These are not the actions of companies which have fundamentally altered their conduct since entering the MSA.
Second, the Court is unable to rely upon the states to vigorously enforce the MSA. This comment is not a criticism, 
but rather a realistic acknowledgment [*2495]  that enforcement depends upon the commitment of resources by 
each state and that many are stretched very thin financially. Even though the MSA allots a certain amount of money 
to each state for purposes of enforcement, in light of the fiscal pressures on states and the constant compromises 
they must make in reference to their financial priorities, this Court cannot be assured that adequate resources will 
be available in the future to enforce the MSA.
46 A defendant seeking to escape a permanent injunction bears the burden of demonstrating that ""subsequent events made it 
absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur."" United States v. Concentrated 
Phosphate Export Ass'n, 393 U.S. 199, 203, 89 S. Ct. 361, 21 L. Ed. 2d 344 (1968) (emphasis added); United States v. W.T. 
Grant Co., 345U.S. 629, 632 (1953).
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118375, *2492

 
The MSA provision that authorizes the state attorneys general to inspect Defendants' books and interview their 
personnel begins expiring in 2006. See MSA § VII(g) at 52 (granting inspection authority to each State ""following 
State-Specific Finality in a Settling State and for seven years thereafter""). This provision creates some amount of 
transparency in Defendants' business practices. Even if the Court were to accept Defendants' view that the MSA 
currently has adequate enforcement mechanisms while the states' inspection authority remains intact, the MSA's 
enforcement mechanisms will steadily become less and less adequate as the authority begins to expire in one state 
after another, starting this year. Additional inspection and discovery [*2496]  authority will be required to ensure that 
the MSA remains meaningful.
In addition, while the MSA requires ""mandatory consultation and discussion"" for every alleged violation, this leads to 
time-consuming enforcement efforts. JD FF ch. 12, ¶ 58 (citing MSA §§ VII.(b)-(c), XVIII(m) (JD 045158)). See, e.g., 
Ohio ex rel. Petro v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 104 Ohio St. 3d 559, 2004- Ohio 7102, 820 N.E.2d 910 (Oh. 
2004) (over five years required to achieve final court ruling that RJR violated MSA by advertising cigarette brand 
logos on promotional matchbooks); People ex rel. Lockyer v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 116 Cal. App. 4th 1253, 
11 Cal. Rptr. 3d 317 (Cal. Ct. App. 2004) (over four and a half years required to achieve ruling that RJR violated 
MSA by failing to modify magazine placement policies). Moreover, the MSA prohibits the states from seeking to 
enforce it on one another's behalf, MSA § VII(b), (c)(1) at 49 (JD 045158). Together, these structural issues in the 
MSA make it a far less powerful enforcement mechanism than Defendants claim.
Defendants nevertheless assert that the MSA's ""liaison mechanism for mandatory consultation and discussion"" 
""has almost always resulted in a satisfactory resolution of [the states'] concerns."" JD FF ch. 12, ¶ 58. What 
Defendants do not acknowledge is that they are free to ignore complaints brought to their attention through this 
mandatory process. At trial, former Brown & [*2497]  Williamson executives Susan Ivey (now Chairman and CEO of 
RJR and President and CEO of RJR's parent company, Reynolds American Inc.) and Susan Smith (now Vice 
President of Marketing Services for RJR) acknowledged that although Brown & Williamson received complaints 
from NAAG and from Governor Laughton Chiles of Florida about its ""B Kool"" advertising campaign, the company 
took no action in response and suffered no consequences as a result. Smith WD, 32:20-33:8; Ivey WD, 11:4-12:1
Finally, two Defendants -- BATCo and Altria — are not even subject to the provisions of the MSA, while another, 
Liggett, is only subject to some MSA provisions. As the Court previously recognized, ""the MSA cannot preclude 
relief in this RICO action because two of the Defendants, BATCo and Altria, are not even signatories to that 
Agreement."" Philip Morris USA, 316 F. Supp. 2d at 12. The point is underscored by Defendants' rationalization — 
discussed above — that Philip Morris and Altria are free to sponsor multiple Marlboro auto racing teams because 
their Marlboro Formula 1 sponsorship is officially controlled by Altria, and Altria did not sign the MSA. See Findings 
of Fact V(F)(5)(e)(2).
D. As to Certain Defendants, There is Not a Reasonable Likelihood [*2498]  of Future Violations of 18 U.S.C. 
§ 1962 (c) and (d)47
47 In an effort to demonstrate that it is not reasonably likely to violate RICO in the United States in the future, BATCo argues that 
it conducts no business in the United States and that it is unlikely to have anything more than ""incidental"" contact with tobacco 
manufacturers in the United States. JD Br. at 126-127. In addition to the fact that future action within the United States is not 
required, each of these assertions is inaccurate. First, BATCo conducts business in the United States through an agreement 
with Lane Limited (which is now owned by Reynolds American, Inc.), which sells and markets millions of BATCo's State Express 
555 brand cigarettes in the United States. (no bates) (US 77453). Second, BATCo continues to participate with other Defendants 
in international organizations that play an important role in the operation of the Enterprise, such as Tobacco Mfrs. Association 
and CECCM. Third, BATCo remains closely affiliated with Reynolds American, Inc., the parent company of R.J. Reynolds 
Tobacco Company and Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. See JD FF Chap. 12, § IV.D.1. ¶¶ 338, 343, 345. In light of BATCo's 
extensive participation in the Enterprise's violations of 1962(c) and (d) and the ongoing activities described here, the Court finds 
BATCo's arguments on its reasonable likelihood of future RICO violations wholly unpersuasive.
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118375, *2495

 
1. CTR
On November 6, 1998, pursuant to the terms of a consent judgment entered in the State of Minnesota case and a 
plan of dissolution approved by the New York State Supreme Court, CTR was dissolved under the New York Not-
for-Profit Corporation Law upon its filing of a certificate of voluntary dissolution with the Secretary of State of the 
State of New York. McAllister WD at 10:20-13:25; 1998 CTR Certificate of Voluntary Dissolution, (JE 021048); 1998 
State of Minnesota Settlement Agreement, (JD 012501); 1998 State of Minnesota Consent Judgment, (JD 093326); 
1998 CTR Plan of Dissolution, (JD 093330); 1998 Order of the Supreme Court of the State of New York, (JD 
093333).
The MSA expressly prohibits the tobacco companies from reconstituting CTR, or any successor companies 
performing similar activities. See (US 64359) (§ III(o)(5)) (""The Participating Manufacturers may not reconstitute 
CTR or its function in any form."").
In the spring of 1997, in anticipation of the possibility of its dissolution, CTR suspended the review, approval and 
funding of new grants. See McAllister WD at 11:4-22; (no bates) (JD 090039) (1997 CTR Annual Report). Under the 
Plan of Dissolution, the moratorium [*2499]  on new grants became permanent. CTR accelerated the funding of 
grants that had been awarded as of April 1997, paying out the last of the grant funds by the end of March 1999. 
CTR's last Annual Report was published in the spring of 1998. See McAllister WD at 13:12-25; see, e.g., (no bates) 
(JD 093371).
Since it made its final payments to grantees in March 1999, CTR has existed as a dissolved corporation for the 
limited purpose of winding up its activities, including storing, maintaining, and making available CTR historical 
documents and defending itself and its member companies in litigation. See McAllister WD at 10:24-11:3, 14:20-
15:6; 1998 CTR Plan of Dissolution, (JD 093330 at §§ 5, 6).
CTR has had no employees since November 30, 2004. Dr. McAllister, now serving as a part-time consultant to 
CTR, remains responsible, as CTR's appointed agent, for ensuring that CTR meets its continuing legal obligations 
as a dissolved corporation. See McAllister WD at 1:7-14. CTR has had no office since the end of 2004. See 
McAllister WD at 14:1-14.
In sum, no new CTR Special Projects were initiated after 1986. The last check drafted to fund a CTR Special 
Project was written in 1990. See McAllister WD at 219:6-10. CTR issued its last press release in 1997. See 
McAllister WD at 219:13-14. CTR's last [*2500]  Annual Report (the 1997 Annual Report) was issued in the spring 
of 1998. See McAllister WD at 219:11-12. CTR stopped funding all scientific research in March 1999 -- more than 
six years ago. See McAllister WD at 219:15-16.
Consequently, CTR is unable to ""continue alleged past RICO violations."" See Mem. Op. and Order #549 (at 6 n.5) 
(""The Court is not unsympathetic to the arguments of CTR and TI [made in their Joint Motion for Summary 
Judgment], who have effectively ceased to exist and seem to have no actual ability to continue alleged past RICO 
violations. The Court hopes that the Government will exercise good litigation judgment in its assessment of what, if 
any, value there is in proceeding against CTR and TI.""). Accordingly, even though CTR is liable for past violations 
of 18 U.S.C. § 1962 (c) and (d), there is no reasonable likelihood of future violations, and therefore no remedies will 
be entered against CTR.
2. The Tobacco Institute
The Master Settlement Agreement (""MSA"") provided for cessation by TI of operations and for dissolution of TI. 
Section III (o)(2) of the MSA provides:
The Tobacco Institute, Inc. (""TI"") (a not-for-profit corporation formed under the laws of the State of New York) 
shall, pursuant to a plan of dissolution to be negotiated [*2501]  by the Attorney General of the State of New 
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118375, *2498

 
York and the Original Participating Manufacturers in accordance with Exhibit G hereto, cease all operations 
and be dissolved in accordance with the laws of the State of New York and under the authority of the Attorney 
General of the State of New York (and with the preservation of all applicable privileges held by any member 
company of TI).
MSA § III(o)(2) US 64359 (at VXA 104 0635). Following the execution of the MSA, TI immediately began winding 
down its operations and arranging for severance of its employees. W. Adams, USA Dep., 6/18/02 at 22:19-23:9, 
42:10-23. TI ceased its public relations, lobbying and other ongoing trade association functions. Id. at 42:10-43:7.
With the execution of the MSA, TI ceased issuing press releases or otherwise making public statements or 
comments concerning tobacco issues. Id. at 75:7-19. In January 31, 1999, TI discharged its operating employees 
except for a skeleton staff which was retained to perform administrative, closedown and litigation support functions. 
Id. at 22:7-23:9, 42:10-43:7.
The limited TI staff retained after January 31, 1999 were engaged solely in closing out TI's affairs in accordance 
with [*2502]  the MSA. (See id. at 22:7-23:9, 42:10-43:7). Their functions were limited to activities such as vacating 
TI's former office space, disposing of office furnishings and equipment, making arrangements for TI employees' 
medical and pension plans to be carried out, and placing TI records in storage. Id.
In accordance with Section III(o)(2) of the MSA, a final Plan of Dissolution for TI was prepared by TI and approved 
by the Attorney General of New York. The Plan of Dissolution was then presented to the Supreme Court of New 
York for approval. On August 31, 2000, that court entered an Order Approving TI's Plan of Corporate Dissolution 
and Certificate of Dissolution. See (no bates) (JE 022000) and (no bates) (JD 080768).
Under the terms of the Plan as entered and approved by the New York court, TI is obligated to ""promptly wind up its 
non-litigation affairs"" and ""shall not perform any function or activities not contemplated by this Plan."" See TI1491-
0989 at 0900-0901 (JE 022000). The only functions or activities permitted by the Plan are winding up TI's affairs 
and defense of litigations. (Id. at 0901).
The only employees or consultants TI is permitted to have are those ""reasonably needed for the conduct [*2503]  of 
litigation activities,"" Id. at 0902, 0905, which is defined as ""the right [of TI] to defend itself against any claims 
threatened or asserted against it now or in the future."" Id. at 0904. Upon the conclusion of litigation against it, TI is 
required to terminate any remaining employees and consultants and ""cease all function."" Id. at 0905. Once all 
litigation against TI has been concluded, TI will cease to exist entirely. W. Adams, United States Dep., 6/18/02, at 
14:19-15:2.
TI is also directed by the Plan of Dissolution, after making all payments and distributions referred to in the Plan, to 
deliver all its remaining assets ""to one or more not-for-profit health or child welfare organizations selected by TI and 
agreed to by the Attorney General."" TI14910898-0918 at 0813 (JE 022000).
TI's Plan also contains an express blanket prohibition on public statements concerning tobacco. Section 5.6 of the 
Plan provides:
No Public Statements. Upon entry of an order approving this Plan, neither TI nor any of its employees or 
agents acting in their official capacity on behalf of TI will issue any statements, press releases, or other public 
statements concerning tobacco, except as necessary in the course of litigation defense as set forth in section 5 
of [*2504]  this Plan.
TI14910898-0918 (JE 022000).
TI's last employee was released on November 30, 2000. W. Adams, United States Dep., 6/18/02, at 21:16-19. 
Since then, TI has had no employees and no consultants other than a Senior Vice President-Administration, William 
Adams, who remains an officer of TI solely to support its litigation defense and handle any remaining administrative 
matters. Id. at 16:7-23. Once litigation against TI as been concluded, Mr. Adams will cease to have any role at all. 
Id.
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118375, *2501

 
TI has no office, no telephone, and no funds or other liquid assets. W. Adams Dep., 6/18/02, at 19:5-23. TI's sole 
assets consist of an appeal bond posted by TI in connection with the pending appeal of a trial court judgment 
entered against TI in a Florida case, Engle v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., et al. Id. at 14:4-7.
Accordingly, even though TI is liable for past violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1962 (c) and (d), there is no reasonable 
likelihood of future violations, and therefore no remedies will be entered against TI.
3. Liggett
Liggett does not have a reasonable likelihood of future RICO violations as part of the Enterprise. As discussed in 
detail in the Findings of Fact, in the mid-1990s, Liggett took historic steps when [*2505]  it became the first 
domestic tobacco company to admit that smoking causes cancer and is addictive, and to include product warnings 
on its packages beyond those required by law. Liggett is the only company to disclose the ingredients of its 
cigarettes on its cartons and was the first to expand voluntarily advertising restrictions and agree to submit to FDA 
jurisdiction. Of the greatest significance, however, is the fact that Liggett provided cooperation and assistance to the 
dozens of States Attorneys General as well as the United States Department of Justice in the prosecution of their 
claims against other tobacco companies. By doing so, Liggett changed the face of tobacco litigation in this country 
and, not surprisingly, distanced itself from the other Defendants.
As a result of these actions, the Court has already found that Liggett withdrew from Defendants' RICO conspiracy. 
See Section VIII(C), supra. While it remains liable for its substantive violations of 1962(c) from the past, Liggett 
poses no reasonable likelihood of future RICO violations.
Liggett today continues to act independently of the other Defendants, even beyond what is required of it by the law 
or the MSA. LeBow WD, 8-10. For example, Liggett [*2506]  continues to take the public position that cigarettes are 
a cause of lung cancer and other serious diseases, and that smoking is addictive. Liggett continues to state publicly 
that it agrees with the positions on these issues as stated by the United States Surgeon General and the public 
health authorities. (Albino WD, 8). Liggett continues to include an additional, voluntary product warning on its 
packages beyond those required by law, and Liggett is the only domestic tobacco company that prints a list of 
ingredients of its cigarettes on its cartons. LeBow WD, 8-9
In addition, Liggett continues to cooperate with public health authorities on a variety of smoking and health issues. 
Beginning in 1997, Liggett has been providing on an annual basis, both to the Centers for Disease Control and the 
Massachusetts Department of Public Health, a complete listing of all additives and ingredients in all of Liggett's 
cigarettes on a brand-by-brand, style-by-style basis. LeBow WD, 9-10. The ingredients of Liggett's cigarettes are 
listed in weight order as they appear in Liggett's cigarettes, exactly in the manner requested by the public health 
authorities. Id.
Moreover, Liggett today is a small player [*2507]  in the domestic tobacco market, with a market share of 2.4% of 
the cigarettes sold in the United States. LeBow WD, 10.48 Liggett today employs between 300-400 persons, and 
manufactures and sells predominately discount, nonbranded cigarettes that compete generally on price alone. 
LeBow WD, 10. Unlike the other Defendant tobacco companies, Liggett does not have brand equity, and competes 
for its small percentage of the domestic market with tobacco companies that are not defendants in this action. 
Dennis W. Carlton, Ph.D. WD, 6, 32. Accordingly, Liggett does not rely on traditional consumer advertising and 
engages in virtually no print or billboard advertising.
Finally, the Government's own witnesses have stated that Liggett made important contributions to the public health 
community, and distinguishes Liggett's current conduct from other tobacco company Defendants. Govt Findings of 
Fact, Section IV.C., paras. 607, 1059-1070. The Government nevertheless asserts that Liggett has ongoing RICO 
violations because it continues to market low tar cigarettes and does not admit that they are no less hazardous than 
their full-flavor counterparts.
48 Liggett today is the fifth largest producer of cigarettes in the United States. LeBow WD, 11.
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118375, *2504

 
Despite the fact that Liggett continues to sell low [*2508]  tar cigarettes, the Court finds that, based on Liggett's 
behavior in every other component of the Enterprise's scheme to defraud and Liggett's withdrawal from the RICO 
conspiracy, the totality of the circumstances demonstrates that Liggett is not reasonably likely to commit future 
RICO violations.49
Accordingly, even though Liggett is liable for past violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1962 (c) and (d), there is no reasonable 
likelihood of future violations, and therefore no remedies will be entered against Liggett.
XI. REMEDIES
A. Legal Standards Governing Remedies
Once RICO liability is established, 18 U.S.C. § 1964(a) states that:
The district courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction to prevent and restrain violations of section 1962 
of this chapter [18 USCS § 1962] by issuing appropriate orders, including, but not limited to: ordering any 
person to divest himself of any interest, direct or indirect, in any enterprise; imposing reasonable restrictions on 
the future activities or investments of any person, including, but not limited to, prohibiting any person from 
engaging in the same type of endeavor as the enterprise engaged in, the activities of which affect interstate or 
foreign commerce; or ordering dissolution or reorganization of any enterprise, [*2509]  making due provision for 
the rights of innocent persons.""
In Order #550, the Court denied Defendants' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment Dismissing the Government's 
Disgorgement Claim and, in doing so, laid out the existing standard for equitable remedies under § 1964(a) which 
prevent and restrain RICO violations. First, the Court noted that the full scope of a court's equitable jurisdiction must 
be recognized and applied except where ""a statute in so many words, or by a necessary and inescapable inference, 
restricts the court's jurisdiction"" or where there is a ""clear and valid legislative command"" limiting jurisdiction. Porter 
v. Warner Holding Co., 328 U.S. 395, 398, 66 S. Ct. 1086, 90 L. Ed. 1332 (1946). Second, the Court held that the 
plain language of § 1964(a) requires a showing of a reasonable likelihood of future RICO violations before entering 
any equitable remedies. Third, the Court noted that one of the purposes of civil remedies under § 1964(a) is ""to 
divest the association of the fruits of its ill-gotten gains."" United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 585, 101 S. Ct. 
2524, 69 L. Ed. 2d 246 (1981). Finally, based on the foregoing conclusions, the Court held that disgorgement 
prevents and restrains future RICO violations and is appropriate as an equitable civil RICO remedy.
Our Court of Appeals, in a 2-1 opinion written by Judge Sentelle, interpreted § 1964(a) to authorize [*2510]  only 
those remedies that are enumerated in the statute and equitable relief that ""prevents and restrains"" a defendant 
from engaging in future RICO violations. Accordingly, this Court is limited to ordering ""remedies explicitly included in 
the statute,"" and ""remedies similar in nature to those enumerated,"" see United States of America v. Philip Morris, 
Inc., 396 F.3d 1190, 1200, 1197, 364 U.S. App. D.C. 454 (2005) (quotations and internal citations omitted). Finding 
that all examples of appropriate remedies given in the text of the statute are ""aimed at separating the RICO criminal 
from the enterprise so that he cannot commit violations in the future,"" id. at 1198 (emphasis in original), and that the 
terms ""prevent and restrain"" are also ""aimed at future actions,"" id. at 1199, the D.C. Circuit concluded that remedies 
similar in nature to those enumerated are ""forward-looking remedies that are aimed at future violations,"" id. at 
1198.50
49 Moreover, because Liggett engages in virtually no consumer advertising, there is little opportunity for it to influence smoker 
beliefs concerning low-tar cigarettes. See JD Final Proposed Findings of Fact.
50 Recently, the Tenth Circuit, without expressing an ""opinion regarding whether, or in what circumstances, disgorgement is 
authorized under RICO"" held that the presence of the term ""restrain"" in a statutory grant of general equity jurisdiction is not 
dispositive evidence of Congress's intent to limit remedies to those that are forward-looking."" United States v. Rx Depot, Inc., 
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118375, *2507

 
Although the Government initially sought $289 billion in disgorgement in this case, Judge Sentelle's majority opinion 
explained that disgorgement is not an available remedy under § 1964(a) because it is not forward looking and does 
not separate the RICO criminal from the enterprise. The court characterized disgorgement strictly and narrowly as a 
""backward-looking remedy focused on remedying [*2511]  the effects of past conduct to restore the status quo."" Id. 
at 1198. Judge Sentelle's opinion distinguished between acting to ""prevent and restrain"" and acting to ""discourage,"" 
and concluded that the general deterrence created by disgorgement ""insofar as it makes RICO violations 
unprofitable"" may not necessarily ""prevent and restrain"" future RICO violations. Id. at 1200. Consequently, the court 
found that disgorgement is not a forward looking remedy aimed at future violations, and therefore is not similar to 
those enumerated in § 1964(a). Additionally, because the court determined that disgorgement is ""aimed at 
separating the criminal from his prior ill-gotten gains"" and not intended to ""separat[e] the criminal from the RICO 
enterprise to prevent future violations . . . [disgorgement] may not be properly inferred from § 1964(a)."" Id. at 
1200.51
Accordingly, this Court may not, as a matter of law, order disgorgement and may order only such remedies as are 
designed to ""prevent and restrain"" Defendants from committing future RICO violations by separating them from the 
RICO enterprise.
Defendants argue that the Court can enter none of the Government's proposed remedies. First, they interpret 
Judge Sentelle's opinion so narrowly as [*2512]  to preclude any remedy other than a standard injunction 
restraining future RICO violations. Specifically, Defendants argue that, as a consequence of the standard which 
they advocate, the Court cannot consider the public interest in fashioning remedies. Second, Defendants argue that 
the mere existence of the MSA renders any remedy which the Court may enter duplicative and therefore 
inappropriate. Finally, Defendants claim that they did not receive fair notice of the remedies which the Government 
seeks and, therefore, the Court cannot enter any of the requested relief.
Defendants are wrong for the following reasons.
First, unless a specific remedy would countermand statutory guidance from Congress, a court must take into 
account the public interest when considering whether its imposition is justified. U.S. Bancorp Mortg. Co. v. Bonner 
Mall P'ship, 513 U.S. 18, 26 (1994), 115 S. Ct. 386, 130 L. Ed. 2d 233 (""As always, when federal courts 
contemplate equitable relief, our holding must also take account of the public interest""). Defendants argue that ""any 
perceived benefit to the public interest cannot determine the outcome if consideration of all the equities . . . tip the 
balance the other way."" JD Corrected Post-Trial Brief at 154-55. There is no question that a court sitting in equity 
may [*2513]  not ""override Congress' policy choice, articulated in a statute, as to what behavior should be 
prohibited."" United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Coop., 532 U.S. 483, 121 S. Ct. 1711, 149 L. Ed. 2d 722 
(2001) (reversing a medical necessity exception to an injunction that was granted on grounds of public interest, 
where the statute clearly prohibited the behavior). However, a court may consider the public interest when 
determining what types of remedies to fashion pursuant to a statute's dictates. Id. at 498 (""To the extent the district 
court considers the public interest . . . the court [may evaluate] how such interest . . . [is] affected by the selection of 
438 F.3d 1052, 1058-1059 (10th Cir. 2006) (declining to apply the D.C. Circuit's interpretation of the term ""restrain"" and 
upholding the Supreme Court interpretation permitting disgorgement as a forward-looking remedy in cases brought under § 
332(a) of the FDCA). Rx Depot followed virtually the same analysis of a court's equitable powers to ""restrain"" violations as this 
Court did in Order #550, relying heavily on Porter v. Warner Holding Co., 328 U.S. 395, 398, 66 S. Ct. 1086, 90 L. Ed. 1332 
(1946) and concluding that disgorgement is allowed under the Federal Food Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which states that ""district 
courts . . . shall have jurisdiction, for cause shown to restrain violations."" Id.
51 This determination has created a Circuit split. Contrary to the D.C. Circuit, both the Fifth and Second Circuits have adopted a 
standard of relief that permits disgorgement where it will prevent and restrain future RICO violations. As the Second Circuit 
reasoned, disgorgement may serve the goal of preventing and restraining future violations where ""there is a finding that the 
gains are being used to fund or promote the illegal conduct, or constitute capital for that purpose."" United States v. Carson, 52 
F.3d 1173, 1182 (2nd Cir. 1995); see also Richard v. Hoechst Celanese Chem. Group, 355 F.3d 345, 354-355 (5th Cir. 2003) 
(adopting the standard set forth by the Second Circuit but denying disgorgement on other grounds).
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118375, *2510

 
an injunction over other enforcement mechanisms.""). Thus, the Court is not precluded from considering the public 
interest when it decides on the appropriateness of remedies.
Second, Defendants' claim that the existence of the MSA precludes all relief sought here is unpersuasive. 
Defendants rely on Ellis v. Gallatin Steel Co., 390 F.3d 461 (6th Cir. 2004), to argue that this Court is precluded 
from issuing any remedies because the MSA already enjoins Defendants' future RICO violations. However, this 
case is distinguishable from Gallatin Steel in a number of significant ways. In that case, two private citizens sought 
injunctive relief to prevent a steel manufacturer and slag processor from allegedly [*2514]  violating the Clean Air 
Act (""CAA"") after a consent decree had been issued. The Sixth Circuit found that because the parties first entered 
into the consent agreement, additional injunctive relief would violate its terms and frustrate its purposes.
First, the Sixth Circuit reversed the district court's imposition of an injunction in Gallatin Steel because the CAA 
primarily serves the public interest, and ""citizens acting as 'private attorneys general' to enforce the [CAA who] seek 
relief . . . and accordingly 'personalized' remedies are not a first priority of the Act."" Id. at 477. In this case, however, 
it is the Government that seeks remedies for the harms Defendants have caused smokers and potential smokers as 
well as the American public as a whole. Where private citizens were seeking redress in Gallatin Steel, in this case, 
Plaintiff, the United States Government, is acting in the public interest.
Second, the court in Gallatin Steel rested its opinion on conditions that are not present here. First, it found that the 
consent decree covered all the claims brought by the parties. Id. at 476. In this case, however, there are remedies 
distinct from and additional to those that were included in the Master [*2515]  Settlement Agreement. Furthermore, 
the MSA is enforced by the states, whereas the remedies sought in this case will be enforced by the federal 
government. Finally, here, certain of the Defendants in this case are not even parties to the MSA and therefore not 
bound by its provisions.
Third, the timing of the claims brought by the citizens in Gallatin Steel also distinguishes that case. In Gallatin Steel, 
the district court granted plaintiffs' injunction when the consent decrees were only three months old, ""meaning that 
the remedial requirements imposed by the decrees either had just been completed or had not been completed at 
all."" Id. at 476. By contrast, the MSA was implemented in 1998, providing eight years for Defendants to meet and 
complete the requirements imposed by that agreement. At this point, after eight years, the weaknesses of the MSA 
are well known, whereas the three month period in Gallatin Steel was clearly insufficient. Additionally, because 
portions of the MSA are due to expire soon, there is no danger that the remedies sought by the Government will be 
duplicative of those already contained in the MSA.
Because of the distinguishing factors set forth above, this Court finds no [*2516]  compelling reasons to follow the 
Sixth Circuit's ruling in Gallatin Steel. Accordingly, the Master Settlement Agreement does not preclude any 
remedies this Court may impose.
Finally, as a general matter, parties must be given fair notice of the remedies sought by opposing counsel. 
Defendants argue that they were not given sufficient notice of the remedies the Government requests. As the circuit 
courts have held, however, ""surprise alone is not a sufficient basis for appellate reversal; appellant must also show 
that the procedures followed resulted in prejudice."" Socialist Workers Party v. Illinois State Bd. Of Elections, 566 
F.2d 586, 587 (7th Cir. 1977) (finding that fair notice was given where appellants received a brief from opponent 
seeking injunctive relief and where more formal notice would not have provided defendants with greater opportunity 
to alter the result); see also United States v. Microsoft Corp., 253 F.3d 34, 103, 346 U.S. App. D.C. 330 (D.C. Cir. 
2001) (finding that fair notice was not given where defendants were denied a ""basic procedural right to have 
disputed facts resolved through an evidentiary hearing""). Where injunctive relief is sought, both parties must be 
given an opportunity to have a remedies hearing. See generally Fed. R. Civ. P. 65. In Microsoft the court failed to 
allow defendants a hearing on remedies, despite their repeated requests. By stark contrast, [*2517]  in this action, 
Defendants received the Government's proposed remedies almost two months before the remedies trial and had an 
additional twelve days after the conclusion of the liability phase to prepare for the remedies phase. Defendants 
participated in a fourteen day remedies trial which was fully briefed, and at which thirteen witnesses testified. They 
had a full opportunity to cross-examine all Government witnesses. Moreover, Defendants point to no specific 
witness they were unable to cross-examine and no substantive area of testimony they were unable to rebut 
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118375, *2513

 
because of the alleged lack of notice. Accordingly, the Government's remedies requests do not abrogate 
Defendants' procedural rights.
B. Specific Remedies
The Court will address each of the Government's proposed remedies seriatim.
1. Prohibition of Brand Descriptors
As described in detail in the Findings of Fact, supra, cigarettes marketed with descriptors such as ""low tar,"" ""light,"" 
""mild,"" and similar terms are no less likely to be harmful than other cigarettes. The terms themselves have no 
standardized meaning aside from a non-enforceable industry practice to apply the ""light"" descriptor to cigarettes 
with 7 to 14 milligrams of tar as measured by [*2518]  the FTC method, and ""ultra light"" to cigarettes with fewer than 
7 milligrams of tar. Keane WD, 56:14-23; Mulholland WD, 26:4-27:9; accord Henningfield WD, 56:8-11. Of even 
greater concern is the fact that Defendants design ""light"" cigarettes to allow smokers to obtain much higher levels of 
nicotine than are measured by the FTC method, and in fact manipulate cigarettes to provide sufficient nicotine 
delivery to create and sustain addiction. Burns WD, 29:6-13; Monograph 13, DXA0310399-0650 (US 58700).
The trial record overwhelmingly demonstrates that Defendants developed and marketed low tar and nicotine brands 
in order to dissuade smokers from quitting smoking. See Findings of Fact Section V(E). Defendants know that 
health concerns are the primary motivation for smokers' attempts to quit. They have conducted extensive research 
on quitting to help them identify, understand, and deter potential quitters. Defendants' internal documents show that 
they were confident that if they could convince potential quitters that low tar cigarettes were a healthier choice and 
an acceptable alternative to quitting, they could keep their sales from declining. See also Burns WD, 41:12-18, 
46:21-47:9, 49:11-20. [*2519] 
Based on that knowledge, Defendants introduced a number of brands and brand extensions lower in tar and 
nicotine and positioned them as 'health reassurance' brands to meet the health concerns of smokers. Defendants' 
own internal research showed that ""smoking low tar and nicotine helped a smoker to reduce guilt about smoking 
and thus made a smoker less likely to quit. Smoking a 'health reassurance' product with its low tar FTC rating was a 
'compromise' to justify not quitting."" Dolan WD, 106:14-107:2; 118:4-8; 118:23-119:21; 126:8-16; accord Burns WD, 
69:3-14 (beginning in the 1950s, Defendants ""introduced and marketed filtered cigarettes and 'low tar and nicotine' 
cigarettes as an effort to prevent smokers from quitting based on growing health concerns among smokers""). As a 
result, consumers labor under a longstanding and pervasive misconception that ""low tar/low nicotine"" cigarettes are 
safer than their full flavor counterparts. See Findings of Fact Section V(E)(3).
As Dr. Farone testified, the terms ""light"" and ""low tar,"" as used by Defendants, are ""meaningless"" and ""arbitrary,"" 
because ""light"" and regular cigarettes of the same brand can have the same FTC yields:
[T]here are lights [*2520]  of certain brands with higher tar levels than regulars of other brands from the same 
company, and there are also lights and regulars of the same brand that have the same FTC tar rating. So 
therefore the term 'light' is not related to tar or taste. For example, according to the most recent FTC report of 
tar and nicotine yields, Philip Morris sells versions of Virginia Slims and Virginia Slims Lights that both deliver 
15 mg of tar by the FTC method.
Farone WD, 116:3-14; 525311179-1223 at 1185, 1207-1208, 1222 (US 52977).
Gary Burger, Senior President of Research & Development for RJR, admitted in a 1997 deposition, that RJR was 
aware that consumers smoke low tar cigarettes for the perceived health benefit. Burger said that ""[c]ertainly, 
smokers perceive lower tar cigarettes in some ways to be better for them and therefore they want them."" He further 
acknowledged that consumers ""have that impression that there are higher levels of bad stuff in high tar cigarettes 
and lower levels of bad stuff in low tar cigarettes."" Burger PD, Arch v. American Tobacco Co., 8/21/97, 226:9-
243:18. In addition, research conducted for B&W as recently as 2000 confirmed that consumers still misperceive 
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118375, *2517

 
""lights"" [*2521]  as less harmful. 250255060-5075 at 5064, 5066-5068, 5071-5075 (US 22170); Ivey WD, 59:20-
60:12.
As data have emerged establishing that ""light"" and ""mild"" cigarettes are at least as harmful as ""full-flavor"" brands, 
Defendants have developed new descriptors to convey implied health reassurance messages. B&W developed and 
marketed the ""Kool Natural Lights"" brand extension in 1998. Despite having market research showing that 
consumers incorrectly interpret the word ""natural"" to mean that the cigarettes are safer than conventional cigarettes, 
B&W advertised Kool Natural Lights without informing consumers that ""natural"" cigarettes are no safer than any 
others. Smith TT, 1/6/05, 9178:18-9182:9; 210430297-0396 at 0322 (US 67711); ADV0100742-0744 (US 2701) 
(advertisement in 2001 issue of Rolling Stone); (US 12651) (advertisement in 2000 issue of Maxim).
Significantly, although lower-yield cigarettes have dominated the U.S. market for many years, there has been no 
corresponding reduction in smoking-related disease among U.S. smokers; in fact, the disease risk has increased. 
Burns WD, 33:18-35:9; Monograph 13, DXA0310399-0650 (US 58700).
Accordingly, the only way to restrain Defendants from their [*2522]  longstanding and continuing fraudulent efforts 
to deceive smokers, potential smokers, and the American public about ""light"" and ""low tar"" cigarettes is to prohibit 
them from using any descriptor which conveys a health message. It is not sufficient to forbid Defendants from 
misrepresenting the health effects of ""light"" and ""low tar"" cigarettes. By using descriptors such as ""lights"" and ""low 
tar,"" Defendants knowingly convey the false impression that cigarettes with those labels are less harmful than other 
cigarettes. Consumers' false belief is so pervasive and longstanding, and has been exploited and promoted by 
Defendants for so long, that preventing and restraining Defendants' future fraud requires a ban on any future use of 
descriptors which convey a health message.
As the National Cancer Institute concluded in Monograph 13, descriptors are inherently deceptive. US 58700 at 
0611, 0646. Similarly, the WHO Scientific Advisory Committee on Tobacco concluded that descriptors are 
inherently misleading, and recommended that ""misleading health and exposure claims should be banned. . . . 
Banned terms should include light, ultra-light, mild and low tar, and may be extended to other misleading [*2523]  
terms."" US 86658 at 0695. As set out above, Defendants' own documents, including consumer research, and 
testimony demonstrate that Defendants both knew and intended to use brand descriptors to convey a false 
perception of reduced harm. See Findings of Fact Sections V(E)(3, 5).
The Court will therefore order a ban on any cigarette descriptors that convey implicit health claims. Prohibition of 
Defendants' future use of deceptive descriptors is forward looking and narrowly tailored to prevent and restrain their 
future fraudulent conduct relating to the marketing of low tar cigarettes. Indeed, this remedy directly addresses the 
ongoing fraud Defendants commit every day with their marketing of ""light"" cigarettes and the virtually certain 
continuation of such fraud in the future in the absence of such a ban. Accordingly, beginning January 1, 2007, 
Defendants are prohibited from using any descriptors indicating lower tar delivery -- including, but not limited to, 
""low tar,"" ""light,"" ""mild,"" ""medium"" and ""ultra light"" -- which create the false impression that such cigarettes are less 
harmful to smokers.52
2. Corrective Communications
The trial record amply demonstrates that Defendants have [*2524]  made false, deceptive, and misleading public 
statements about cigarettes and smoking from at least January 1954, when the Frank Statement was published up 
until the present. See Findings of Fact Sections V(A)(5)(c) and V(G)(7, 8), supra (public statements on adverse 
52 Defendants claim that prohibition of their deceptive use of descriptors ""would improperly invade the primary jurisdiction of the 
FTC,"" JD PFOF, ch. 13 ¶ 599, but ""[t]he FTC does not impose, regulate, or require [descriptors]. How those terms are applied, 
and on which brands, is entirely up to the tobacco companies."" Henningfield WD, 56:8-11. Further, Defendants' claim reiterates 
their previous argument that such relief is preempted by the FTC Act, an argument which the Court has already rejected. See 
United States v. Philip Morris, Inc., 263 F. Supp. 2d 72, 74 (D.D.C. 2003).
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118375, *2520

 
health effects, including exposure to secondhand smoke); Section V(B)(4), supra (public statements on 
addictiveness of smoking and nicotine); Section V(C)(3), supra (public statements on nicotine manipulation); 
Section V(F)(7), supra (public statements on youth marketing); Section V(E)(4), supra (statements on ""light"" and 
""low tar"" cigarettes).
Evidence in the record also amply demonstrates that certain of Defendants' public statements communicating their 
positions on smoking and health issues continue to omit material information or present information in a misleading 
and incomplete fashion. For example, Reynolds's current website statement on the health effects of smoking 
continues to insist that smoking ""causes disease in some individuals"" only ""in combination with other factors."" (JD 
068012); see also Schindler TT, 1/24/05, 10810:9-10813:5 (Reynolds' recent Chairman and CEO refusing to admit 
that cigarette smoking causes [*2525]  disease).
In addition, Philip Morris's current website claims that the company's position on addiction is the same as the public 
health community's, but Philip Morris's statement on addiction omits the material information that nicotine delivered 
by cigarettes is a drug and that it is addictive. 3000172188-2188 (JD 053199).
As the Court has noted, certain language in some of Defendants' more recent positions on smoking and health 
issues, following their decades of denials and distortion, do represent a step forward. See, e.g., Henningfield TT, 
11/29/04, 7185:2-8. However, evidence in the record supports a finding that notwithstanding Defendants' self-
serving claims that they have been more forthcoming on smoking and health issues, and notwithstanding a general 
prohibition in the MSA precluding those Defendants who are a party to it from making any ""material 
misrepresentation of fact regarding the health consequences of using any Tobacco Product,"" Defendants continue 
to make affirmative statements on smoking and health issues that are fraudulent. MSA § III(r) at 36 (JD-045158). 
Accordingly, an injunction ordering Defendants to issue corrective statements is appropriate and necessary 
to [*2526]  prevent and restrain them from making fraudulent public statements on smoking and health matters in 
the future.
Contrary to Defendants' arguments, the First Amendment does not preclude corrective statements where 
necessary to prevent consumers from being confused or misled. Any interest Defendants have in avoiding 
compelled speech are easily outweighed by the government's interest in preventing future consumer deception or 
confusion. See Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel of Supreme Court of Ohio, 471 U.S. 626, 651, 105 S. Ct. 
2265, 85 L. Ed. 2d 652, 17 Ohio B. 315 (1985) (upholding disclosure requirement in attorney advertising regarding 
terms of contingency agreement). In accordance with this principle, our Court of Appeals has expressly held that 
mandatory disclosures regarding commercial products are consistent with the First Amendment when required to 
correct a manufacturer's campaign of deceptive or misleading marketing or to prevent consumer confusion. See 
Novartis Corp. v. FTC, 223 F.3d 783, 788-89, 343 U.S. App. D.C. 111 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (holding that the trial court 
was permitted to enter a corrective statement remedy because it ""advances precisely the 'interest involved,' namely 
the avoidance of misleading and deceptive advertising); Warner-Lambert Co. v. FTC, 562 F.2d 749, 769-70 (D.C. 
Cir. 1977).
In Warner-Lambert, the D.C. Circuit upheld the FTC's order which required Warner-Lambert to cease and desist 
from representing that Listerine mouthwash prevents or alleviates the common [*2527]  cold, and required the 
company to include in future advertising the phrase ""Listerine will not help prevent colds or sore throats or lessen 
their severity."" 562 F.2d at 756. The Court rejected a First Amendment challenge to the order, finding that the 
protection extended to commercial speech in Virginia State Board of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer 
Council, Inc., 425 U.S. 748, 96 S. Ct. 1817, 48 L. Ed. 2d 346 (1976), which expressly permitted government 
regulation of false or misleading advertising, authorized an order requiring the company to make corrective 
statements in order to counteract its earlier, fraudulent statements. The court also upheld the FTC's position that 
the corrective statements were necessary because ""a hundred years of false cold claims have built up a large 
reservoir of erroneous consumer belief which would persist, unless corrected, long after petitioner ceased making 
the claims."" Id.
The Court explained, in language that is particularly applicable to this case, that:
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118375, *2524

 
To be sure, current and future advertising of Listerine, when viewed in isolation, may not contain any 
statements which are themselves false or deceptive. But reality counsels that such advertisements cannot be 
viewed in isolation; they must be seen against the background of over 50 years in which Listerine has been 
proclaimed and purchased as a [*2528]  remedy for colds. When viewed from this perspective, advertising 
which fails to rebut the prior claims as to Listerine's efficacy inevitably builds upon those claims; continued 
advertising continues the deception, albeit implicitly rather than explicitly. . . . Under this reasoning the First 
Amendment presents no direct obstacle. The Commission is not regulating truthful speech protected by the 
First Amendment, but is merely requiring certain statements which, if not present in current and future 
advertisements, would render those advertisements themselves part of the continuing deception of the public.
Id. at 769.
Here, too, certain Defendants have recently modified their public statements regarding the adverse health effects of 
smoking cigarettes and their addictiveness. Nevertheless, as in Warner-Lambert, additional corrective statements to 
consumers and the public are necessary to prevent current and future advertisements from becoming ""themselves 
part of the continuing deception of the public."" 562 F.2d at 769. The injunctive relief sought here is narrowly tailored 
to prevent Defendants from continuing to disseminate fraudulent public statements and marketing messages by 
requiring them to issue truthful corrective communications. See [*2529]  Zauderer, 471 U.S. at 651.
The evidence identifies the various venues in which Defendants have made their fraudulent public statements about 
cigarettes, including, but not limited to, newspapers, television, magazines, onsets, and Internet websites. See 
generally, Findings of Fact. For example, from the inception of the Enterprise's fraudulent scheme, newspapers and 
magazines have been primary vehicles for disseminating Defendants' public statements on smoking and health 
issues. See, e.g., 86017454-7454 (US 21418) (1954 Frank Statement printed in 448 newspapers nationwide); 
2023011263-1263 (US 20371) (1994 Philip Morris ""Facts You Should Know"" advertisement in the New York 
Times); 500810940-0941 (US 23036) (BATCo's Blackie Letter to Editor in 1994); TI00581619-1629 (US 62969); 
Dawson WD, 114:18-115:21; Dawson TT, 1/12/05, 9907:21-9918:8 (ghostwritten letter to the editor challenging 
evidence of health effects of secondhand smoke, prepared for outside scientist to send to editors at AP, UPI, and 
22 newspapers across the country, without disclosing TI's role or that scientist was a paid Tobacco Institute 
consultant); 513943434-3434 (US 50268) (1984 RJR newspaper statement that whether smoking causes disease 
is [*2530]  an ""open controversy"").
More recently, Defendants -- particularly Altria and Philip Morris -- have used many of these same vehicles very 
effectively to disseminate their recently adopted Corporate Principles, including statements on smoking and health 
positions and alleged youth smoking prevention efforts. Szymanczyk WD, 86:22-93:3, 150:12-22. See generally 
Keane TT, 1/19/05, 10566:4-10578:17. For example, Philip Morris and Altria have run a range of television (and 
radio) advertisements to improve their public image, to promote Philip Morris's website, and to warn the public that 
there is no such thing as a safe cigarette. See, e.g., Keane TT, 10/19/05, 10577:1-25, 10620:9-18 (testimony about 
Philip Morris's national television and radio advertising campaign).
Accordingly, the Court will structure a remedy which uses the same vehicles which Defendants have themselves 
historically used to promulgate false smoking and health messages. Specifically, the Court will order Defendants to 
make corrective statements about addiction (that both nicotine and cigarette smoking are addictive); the adverse 
health effects of smoking (all the diseases which smoking has been proven to cause); the adverse [*2531]  health 
effects of exposure to ETS (all the diseases which exposure to ETS has been proven to cause); their manipulation 
of physical and chemical design of cigarettes (that Defendants do manipulate design of cigarettes in order to 
enhance the delivery of nicotine); and light and low tar cigarettes (that they are no less hazardous than full-flavor 
cigarettes). Within sixty days of the issuance of this opinion and order, both parties will submit a proposal for the 
exact wording of these statements. After the Court approves particular statements, Defendants must publish such 
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118375, *2527

 
corrective statements in newspapers and disseminate them through television, advertisements, onsets, in retail 
displays, and on their corporate websites, as detailed in the accompanying Order.53
3. Disclosure of Documents and Disaggregated Marketing Data
As discussed in great detail in the Findings of Fact, Defendants' suppression and concealment of information has 
been integral to the Enterprise's overarching scheme to defraud. Not only have Defendants failed to publicly 
disclose all the information they internally held about their cigarettes, but they have also created false controversies 
about the existence of such [*2532]  information.
The Court finds that in order to prevent and restrain such RICO violations in the future, Defendants must create and 
maintain document depositories and websites which provide the Government and the public with access to all 
industry documents disclosed in litigation from this date forward. Disclosing such information will allow the public to 
monitor what Defendants are doing internally and to assess the accuracy of future information they may make 
available about their activities and their products. Imposing such disclosure requirements will act as a powerful 
restraint on Defendants' future fraudulent conduct. Indeed, this remedy is exactly what Judge Williams, in his 
concurrence in the disgorgement opinion, recommends that the District Court do under § 1964(a): ""impose 
transparency requirements so that future violations will be quickly and easily identified."" 396 F.3d at 1203 (Williams, 
J., concurring).
The Supreme Court has recognized, in numerous other contexts over the past century, that compelled disclosures 
of information can prevent and restrain future frauds. In the election context, it explained that ""disclosure 
requirements deter actual corruption and avoid the appearance of corruption [*2533]  by exposing large 
contributions and expenditures to the light of publicity."" Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 67, 96 S. Ct. 612, 46 L. Ed. 2d 
659 (1976) (per curiam) (discussing campaign contribution disclosure requirements); see also Buckley v. Am. 
Constitutional Law Found., Inc., 525 U.S. 182, 222, 119 S. Ct. 636, 142 L. Ed. 2d 599 (1999) (O'Connor, J., 
concurring in part and dissenting in part). In a different context, in Village of Schaumburg v. Citizens for a Better 
Env't, 444 U.S. 620, 637-38, 100 S. Ct. 826, 63 L. Ed. 2d 73 (1980), the Supreme Court struck down under the First 
Amendment an ordinance that sought to reduce fraud by charitable organizations by dictating what percentage of 
their income they could spend on particular activities, but observed that ""[e]fforts to promote disclosure of the 
finances of charitable organizations also may assist in preventing fraud by informing the public of the ways in which 
their contributions will be employed."" 444 U.S. at 637-38 (footnote omitted).
The Supreme Court has authorized injunctive relief requiring defendants who have been found to have engaged in 
past fraud to make ongoing public disclosures to prevent similar fraudulent conduct in the future. In SEC v. Capital 
Gains Research Bureau, Inc., 375 U.S. 180, 84 S. Ct. 275, 11 L. Ed. 2d 237 (1963), the Supreme Court held that 
because the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 authorized courts ""to enjoin any practice which operates 'as a fraud or 
deceit upon any client or prospective client,'"" the trial court was authorized to issue an injunction requiring the 
defendant to make ongoing public disclosures [*2534]  as a ""mild prophylactic"" to prevent it from repeating its past 
fraudulent and deceitful practices. 375 U.S. at 185, 193, 198-99.
53 Defendants' argument that requiring corrective statements on package onserts would conflict with the Federal Cigarette 
Labeling and Advertising Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1331 et seq. (""FCLAA"") is unconvincing. This remedy falls within the narrow scope of 
equitable powers granted to the Court under Section 1964(a) because it specifically prevents and restrains Defendants from 
continuing to make statements about smoking and health that are fraudulent and misleading in vehicles which are likely to reach 
consumers. It does not implicate Section 5(a) of the FCLAA, because Section 5(a) only prohibits ""state and federal rulemaking 
bodies from mandating particular cautionary statements"" on cigarette packages. Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U.S. 504, 
518, 112 S. Ct. 2608, 120 L. Ed. 2d 407 (1992). Under the FCLAA, a ""package"" is defined as ""a pack, box, carton, or container 
of any kind in which cigarettes are offered for sale, sold, or otherwise distributed to consumers."" 15 U.S.C. § 1332 (4). An onsert, 
which is only a small informational brochure attached to the outside of the ""pack box, carton, or container . . . in which cigarettes 
are offered for sale, sold, or otherwise distributed to consumers,"" is not a package. Therefore, the remedy at issue does not 
implicate the FCLAA's preemption provision.
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118375, *2531

 
As discussed below, most Defendants are currently subject to some public disclosure requirements for documents 
under the MSA. Most of those requirements will end between 2008 and 2010. Extending those obligations, and 
subjecting all Defendants to similar, ongoing disclosure obligations, will work to prevent and restrain them from 
engaging in future frauds.
The Government has also requested that Defendants be ordered to produce and make public all ""health and safety 
risk information"" in their own files relating to their products. The Government argues that disclosure of such 
information will prevent and restrain Defendants from making fraudulent denials about the hazardousness of their 
cigarettes. Although disclosure of health and safety risk information would obviously serve the public interest, the 
Government's request is far too broad and not narrowly tailored enough to include as a remedy.
a. Depositories
Requiring Defendants to make public the documents that they produce or use in future litigation or administrative 
actions, with certain safeguards to protect privileged and confidential [*2535]  trade secret information, is a first step 
towards preventing and restraining Defendants from engaging in future fraudulent activities. Document depositories 
will provide hard copies of documents to the public and thus will reduce Defendants' ability to suppress, conceal, or 
remove those documents from public access. While Defendants complain about the expense and burdensomeness 
of the Government's request, they are basically being required to merely extend into the future the operation of 
document storage facilities which have existed for almost ten years.
Currently, certain Defendants maintain the Guildford and Minnesota Depositories, which contain hard copies of 
documents produced in those respective sets of litigation. The May 1998 Minnesota settlement obliged the settling 
defendants in that case to pay for maintenance and operation of the Minnesota Depository for ten years. Those 
Defendants and BATCo were also required to send any additional documents produced in other smoking and 
health litigation to the Minnesota Depository during the same ten year period. Those obligations cease in May 2008. 
Neither Liggett nor Altria is subject to those obligations.
During the Minnesota litigation, [*2536]  BATCo created the Guildford Depository in Guildford, England, to provide 
the Minnesota litigants with access to documents created before the document production cutoff date in that 
litigation, August 18, 1994. See Order #38 (protocols for United States trip to Guildford Depository for access to pre-
August 18, 1994 documents available to the public); Order #75 ¶ 2 at 2 (same, for access to non-public ""files 
created between August 18, 1994 and December 31, 1999""). BATCo is obliged to maintain and operate the 
Guildford Depository collection of documents from 1994 and earlier. See Minnesota Consent Judgment § VII(D) 
(JD-093326). That obligation also ceases in May 2008.
The Court will order Defendants to continue maintaining their Minnesota and Guildford Depository obligations for an 
additional fifteen years. Furthermore, Defendants must provide meaningful tools to identify and analyze those 
documents. To that end, both document depositories must include databases which search individual documents 
(rather than files) by multiple bibliographic fields, such as Bates number, date, author, title, etc. Defendants are to 
employ the twenty-nine bibliographic fields specified in the MSA. Finally, [*2537]  Defendants must allow greater 
access to the Guildford Depository than that which is currently available. Presently, public access to the Guildford 
Depository is severely restricted, with only one organization and no more than six visitors allowed access per day; 
and copying requests often take weeks or months to fulfill. See Health Committee, U.K. House of Commons, The 
Tobacco Industry and the Health Risks of Smoking, vol. 1 (2000), (¶¶ 234, 237); 322241213-1295 at 1282-1283 
(US 93249); 770007956-8214 at 7994 (US 88132). Defendants will be required to provide access, at a minimum, to 
six organizations and a dozen visitors per day.
b. Websites
Section IV of the MSA obliges certain Defendants to create and maintain document websites for all documents 
produced during litigation, except those which are privileged or confidential. See MSA § IV(c) & (e) at 36, 39 (JD 
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118375, *2534

 
045158). See, e.g., Keane TT, 1/18/05, 10376:22-10377:7 (discussing Philip Morris's document website, 
www.pmdocs.com); McAllister WD, 8:25-9:4, 15:4-5 (discussing CTR document website, http://www.ctr-usa.org/ctr). 
The MSA's document website obligations expire on June 30, 2010. Neither Altria nor BATCo was a signatory to the 
MSA, [*2538]  and therefore neither is subject to these obligations.
Document websites have several significant desirable features that document depositories do not. Collections of 
tobacco documents placed on the web following the litigation of the 1990s, unlike the majority of non-digitized 
archival materials, are generally searchable through the web. In addition, relatively few members of the public are 
able to travel to Minnesota or England to access the Minnesota and Guildford Depositories, respectively, so a 
document website ""increases the availability of the documents to the general public."" Brandt WD, 28:1-8; 
Szymanczyk WD, 202:4-6.
Accordingly, the Court will order Defendants to maintain websites for all documents which have been produced in 
litigation for a period of fifteen years. In addition, Defendants must provide bibliographic information for each 
document, if it is not apparent on the face of the document, and shall make such documents searchable by multiple 
bibliographic fields.
c. Privilege Claims
The tobacco industry has withheld enormous numbers of documents on grounds of privilege. The defendants in the 
Minnesota litigation, for instance, withheld some 230,000 documents (estimated [*2539]  to contain over 1,000,000 
pages) on grounds of privilege or confidentiality because of proprietary interest. See State of Minnesota v. Philip 
Morris, 606 N.W.2d at 682. Given the magnitude of this litigation, the volume of documents over which Defendants 
asserted privilege is, if anything, substantially larger. For example, BATCo alone served privilege logs in this case 
with 91,723 entries for 72,593 different documents that it withheld from production on grounds of privilege or 
protection. See R&R #112 at 4 & n.3, adopted by Order #359. In addition, as detailed in Section V(H) of the 
Findings of Fact, Defendants have abused these protections, using privilege and confidentiality designations to 
conceal potentially damaging information.
The purposes of document disclosure will be substantially frustrated unless the Court requires Defendants to 
provide complete and accurate information about any documents they withhold on grounds of privilege or other 
protection, including confidentiality. In order to provide the public with a reasonable method to determine which 
documents Defendants withhold on such grounds, the Court will order Defendants henceforth to provide full 
bibliographic information for all withheld documents, including titles [*2540]  (as well as a brief summary of the basis 
for the privilege or confidentiality assertion).
Compelling Defendants to provide accurate and updated indices of all documents they are withholding on grounds 
of privilege or confidentiality is the only way to guarantee transparency and ensure that Defendants do not engage 
in similar egregious conduct in the future. Without a Court-ordered mechanism to ensure that all appropriate 
documents are either disclosed, or are logged as being withheld, Defendants will continue to suppress documents 
from the public. Defendants must similarly be required to identify all document fields and give meaningful 
explanations for all documents that they withhold on grounds of confidentiality.
Defendants will also be required to provide regularly-updated information concerning all waivers and losses of 
privilege and confidentiality. Indeed, in Order #51, § III.G.9, this Court ordered Defendants to identify all documents 
being withheld on grounds of privilege over which a court had previously ruled that their privilege assertion had 
been waived or was invalid. Imposing such a requirement on an ongoing basis is necessary to ensure that accurate 
and current information [*2541]  is available concerning which withheld documents have been adjudicated 
nonprivileged or non-confidential. Such a requirement is also necessary to ensure that once a Defendant waives 
privilege over particular documents, the public is on notice if and when the Defendant refuses to make those 
documents public.
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118375, *2537

 
d. Disaggregated Marketing Data
The FTC requires Defendants to maintain disaggregated marketing data54 and to submit it at regular intervals, 
under strict confidentiality, pursuant to that agency's schedule for disclosure. Such data reveals with specificity 
exactly what Defendants' marketing dollars are being spent on. Such information has never been available to the 
public because the FTC only publishes the data in aggregated form.
In order to ensure transparency of Defendants' marketing efforts, particularly those directed towards youth, and 
what effect such efforts are having, the Court will order Defendants to provide their disaggregated marketing data to 
the Government according to the same schedule on which they provide it to the FTC. Disclosure of this data will 
prevent and restrain Defendants from continuing to make false denials about their youth marketing efforts and will 
enable [*2542]  the Government to monitor such activities. The data which Defendants provide to the Government 
will be disaggregated by type of marketing, brand, geographical region, type of promotion or marketing used, 
number of cigarettes sold, and location of marketing (e.g. in store, in magazine, etc.). Because such information is 
clearly proprietary, however, it will not be made public, as the Government requests. Instead, it will be disclosed 
only to the Department of Justice, the enforcing agent for this decree, and be subjected to appropriate protective 
orders, such as have already been used in this litigation with no difficulties.
4. General Injunctive Provisions 55
Even under the narrow interpretation of 18 USC 1964(a) by which this Court is bound, the Court may enjoin specific 
future RICO violations upon its finding of liability under 1962(c) and (d). Accordingly, Defendants will be ordered to 
refrain from engaging in any act of racketeering, as defined in 18 USC §1961(1) relating in any way to 
manufacturing, marketing, promotion, health consequences or sale of cigarettes in the United States.
Defendants will also be ordered not to participate in the management and/or control of any of the affairs of CTR, TI, 
CIAR, or any [*2543]  successor entities.
Defendants will also be ordered not to reconstitute the form or function of CTR, TI, or CIAR.
Finally, because this is a case involving fraudulent statements about the devastating consequences of smoking, 
Defendants will be prohibited from making, or causing to be made in any way, any material, false, misleading or 
deceptive statement or representation concerning cigarettes that is disseminated in the United States.
5. National Smoker Cessation Program
As laid out in detail in the Findings of Fact, Defendants employed highly sophisticated and expensive promotional 
campaigns to portray light and low tar cigarettes as less harmful than full flavor cigarettes in order to keep smokers 
from quitting. Defendants' concerted and ongoing effort to defraud consumers regarding light and low tar cigarettes 
has been a calculated and extremely successful scheme to increase their revenues at the expense of smokers, 
potential smokers, and the American public. Over 50% of those who smoke light and ultra light cigarettes 
mistakenly believe that lights offer a less hazardous option to full flavor cigarettes. Weinstein WD 53:3-18. Of the 
54 Disaggregated data is data broken down by type of marketing, brand, geographical region, number of cigarettes sold, 
advertising in stores, and any other category of data collected and/or maintained by or on behalf of each Defendant regarding 
their cigarette marketing efforts.
55 The Government has also requested a specific injunction against Defendants' ongoing and future youth marketing. Although 
such a remedy would certainly serve the public interest, it does not prevent and restrain future RICO violations, which, in this 
case, are not Defendants' continuing efforts to market to youth but rather their false denials of those efforts. Accordingly, 
because this injunction does not meet the standard set forth in Judge Sentelle's"
