STIPULATION OF SETTLEMENT 
This Stipulation of Settlement (""Settlement Agreement"") is made and entered into as of this 27 day of May, 2003, 
between Vista Healthplan, Inc. (""Vista""), one of the named plaintiffs in the above-styled action, individually and as 
representative of the proposed Third-Party Payor Class 1, and American BioScience, Inc. (""ABP""), one of the 
named Defendants in this action.
WHEREAS, Vista commenced this action on June 11, 2001, against ABI and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company 
(""Bristol""), alleging that Defendants delayed the entry of generic paclitaxel from coming to market thereby [**70]  
causing indirect purchasers to pay supra-competitive prices for Taxol and generic paclitaxel;
WHEREAS, Vista's Complaint asserted violations of federal antitrust law, state antitrust and/or unfair business 
competition statutes and state common law;
WHEREAS, ABI denies that it has committed any violation of law or engaged in any wrongdoing, denies any and all 
liability to Vista and the Class, denies that it is subject to jurisdiction in the District of Columbia, and has asserted a 
number of defenses to Vista's claims;
WHEREAS, since the filing of this Action, Vista and Class Counsel have engaged in an extensive investigation 
relating to the claims and underlying events alleged in the Complaint. Among other things, Class Counsel have: (1) 
reviewed and analyzed thousands of documents produced by Bristol; ABI and third parties; (2) engaged in legal 
research and analysis of a myriad of issues relating to certification, liability, causation and damages; (3) briefed 
substantive motions on liability and certification; and (4) retained and consulted with economists and other experts 
with respect to causation and damages allegedly sustained by the Class as a result of the  [*69]  wrongful 
conduct [**71]  alleged in the Complaint. Class Counsel are therefore thoroughly familiar with issues of certification, 
liability, causation and damages with respect to the claims asserted in the Complaint and defenses asserted in 
ABI's Answer;
WHEREAS, Class Counsel have engaged in extensive discovery, thoroughly investigated the facts of this Action, 
considered ABI's defenses, and reviewed the pertinent statutory and case law on liability and class certification, 
Class Counsel have concluded that it would be in the best interests of the Class to enter into this Settlement 
Agreement with ABI because the Settlement would be a fair, reasonable and adequate resolution of this Action; 
WHEREAS, ABI, while continuing to deny vigorously Vista's allegations and any liability with respect to any and all 
claims asserted in the Complaint, nevertheless recognizes the costs and uncertainties attendant upon further 
litigation of the claims in this Action, and has therefore concluded that it is desirable to enter into this Settlement 
Agreement to avoid further expense;
WHEREAS, it is the intention of the Settling Parties that this Settlement resolve, compromise and settle all claims of 
the Class against ABI [**72]  as more particularly provided below;
NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY STIPULATED AND AGREED, by and among the Settling Parties, through 
their undersigned counsel, subject to Court approval pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e), to all of the terms and 
conditions set forth herein, as follows:
I. DEFINITIONS 
1 Capitalized terms, unless otherwise noted, are defined below in Section I of this Settlement Agreement.
266 F. Supp. 2d 44, *68; 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9557, **68

 
As used in this Settlement Agreement, the following terms shall have the following meanings:
A. ""ABI"" shall mean defendant American BioScience, Inc.
B. ""Action"" shall mean Vista Healthplan, Inc. et al. v. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and American BioScience, Inc., Case 
No. 1:01CV01295 (EGS) (D.D.C.).
C. ""Allocation and Distribution Plan"" shall mean, subject to Court approval, the following: The Settling Parties agree 
that the ""Net Settlement Fund"" shall be allocated and distributed as follows:
(1) All Class Members' timely and valid claims shall be valued as follows: The sum of all Taxol Payments 
multiplied by seventeen percent (17%). This amount shall be referred to as the Class Member's ""Recognized 
Loss.""
(2) To satisfy the Recognized Loss of Non-J-Code Class Members, thirty thousand dollars ($ 30,000) of the Net 
Settlement Fund (or other amount [**73]  approved by the Court) shall be set aside as the Preferential Fund.
(3) The Recognized Loss of Non-J-Code Class Members and J-Code Class Members shall be paid out of the 
Net Settlement Fund as follows:
(a) The Recognized Loss of Non-J-Code Class Members shall first be paid out of the Preferential Fund on a 
pro-rata basis;
(b) To the extent that the Recognized Loss of Non-J-Code Class Members is not one hundred percent (100%) 
satisfied from the Preferential Fund, the unsatisfied amounts of the Recognized Loss of the Non-J-Code Class 
Members will be paid from the Non-Preferential Fund together with the Recognized Loss of J-Code Class 
Members on a pro-rata basis.
(c) If the Recognized Loss of Non-J-Code Class Members is one hundred percent (100%) satisfied from  [*70]  
the Preferential Fund, and there remains money in the Preferential Fund, the remaining money will be added to 
the Non-Preferential Fund for payment of J-Code Class Members' Recognized Loss on a pro-rata basis.
(d) To the extent that a Class Member used more than one reimbursement or payment system during the Class 
Period; and further, has valid claims as a Non-J-Code Class Member for only part of the Class Period,  [**74]  
that Class Member's claims shall be allocated as follows: (1) the Class Member shall disclose, if applicable, the 
date when the Class Member switched to or from using a reimbursement or payment system based on a J-
Code Medicare Fee Schedule (or any similar reimbursement or payment system), together with any other 
information relevant to determining the proportion of its Taxol Payments that were made under a Non-J-Code 
reimbursement or payment system (or similar system); (2) based on the date and other information disclosed, 
the Claims Administrator shall calculate the Class Member's actual breakdown of Taxol Payments or, if 
applicable, calculate the percentage of the Class Period that the Class Member was a Non-J-Code Class 
Member; and (3) the Class Member will be treated as both a J-Code Class Member and a Non-J-Code Class 
Member for purposes of Paragraph I.B.(3)(a)-(c) hereof, according to its actual breakdown of Taxol Payments 
or percentage determined in subsection (2) above, if applicable. For illustration purposes only of calculating the 
above-mentioned percentage, if a, Class Member has a $ 1,000,000 Recognized Loss, was a J-Code Class 
Member from January 1, 1999 though December 31, 2001 and [**75]  a Non-J-Code Class Member for the rest 
of the Claim Period, then the Claims Administrator would calculate that the Class Member was a J-Code Class 
Member for 75% of the Class Period, and would deem that Class Member to have a $ 750,000 Recognized 
Loss as a J-Code Class Member and a $ 250,000 Recognized Loss as a Non-J-Code Class Member.

250,000 owned by it in its subsidiary, American Pharmaceutical Partners, Inc., pursuant to a securities account 
pledge agreement containing terms agreed to by the parties, to be executed by the parties no later than ten (10) 
calendar days after preliminary approval of the settlement between the parties is granted by the Court.
B. Qualified Settlement Fund 
The Escrow Account is intended by the parties hereto to be treated as a ""qualified settlement fund"" for federal 
income tax purposes pursuant to Treas. Reg. § 1.468B-1, and to that end the parties hereto Shall cooperate with 
each other and shall not take a position in any filing or before any tax authority that is inconsistent with such 
treatment. Whether or not Final Approval of this settlement has occurred, and whether or not the Escrow Account 
qualifies as a qualified settlement fund within the meaning of Treas. Reg. § 1.468B-1, Lead Counsel shall cause to 
be paid from the Escrow Account any taxes or estimated taxes due [**84]  on any income earned on the funds in 
the Escrow Account and all related costs, expenses and penalties, including any tax liabilities or penalties imposed 
on ABI with respect to such income. Third-Party Payor Class Members shall have no recourse against ABI for such 
amounts paid out of the Settlement Fund. If amounts received by the Third-Party Payor Class Members, or any 
portion thereof, are construed to be income, it is their sole responsibility to pay taxes on the amount construed to be 
income, plus any penalties or interest, and ABI shall have no liability for such taxes, penalties or interest.
C. All Claims Satisfied by Settlement Fund
Each Class Member shall look solely to the Settlement Fund for settlement and satisfaction, as provided herein, of 
all claims released by Third-Party Payor Class Members pursuant to this Settlement Agreement. Except as 
provided by  [*74]  order of the Court pursuant to this Settlement Agreement, no Third-Party Payor Class Member 
shall have any interest in the Settlement Fund or any portion thereof.

Vista and Class Counsel shall not voluntarily provide work product, expert or consultant analyses, IMS data, or 
any [**85]  other documents related to this Action to any Third-Party Payor Opt Out or to any other person, and 
shall prohibit, to the extent permissible, any experts previously retained by Class Counsel in connection with this 
Action from accepting an engagement in any action based on the same subject matter of this Action.
E. Dismissal of Related Actions
Upon Final Approval (as defined in Paragraph IV.D.), Lead Counsel shall use all reasonable means to seek 
dismissal with prejudice of all Related Actions with all parties in those actions responsible for their own fees and 
costs associated with those actions, without prejudice of the plaintiffs in those actions participating in the 
settlements reached in this Action or the States Action.
F. Dismissal of Ramona Sakiestewa's Claims Without Preiudice
Upon Final Approval (as defined in Paragraph IV.D.), the parties agree and stipulate pursuant to Rule 41(a)(1) that 
Plaintiff Ramona Sakiestewa shall dismiss all of her claims in the Action without prejudice to her participating in the 
settlement reached in the States Action.

in this Action including, without limitation, any such claims that have been asserted or could have been asserted 
based on the facts alleged in the operative complaint in this Action against the Releasees; provided however, that

In addition, each Releasor hereby expressly waives and releases, upon this Settlement Agreement becoming final, 
any and all provisions, rights, benefits conferred by section 1542 of the California Civil Code, which provides:
A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at

Releasor hereby expressly waives and fully,  [**95]  finally and forever settles and releases, upon this Settlement 
Agreement becoming final, the Released Claims, whether any Released Claim is known or unknown, suspected or 
unsuspected, contingent or non-contingent, concealed or hidden, without regard to the subsequent discovery or

forever settles any and all Released Claims it may have under § 17200, et seq. , of the California Business and 
Professions Code.
B. Reservation of Claims

Releasees, and the parties do not intend this Settlement Agreement, or any part hereof, to  [*78]  release or 
otherwise affect in any way any rights Third-Party Payor Class Members have or may have against any other party

IV.D. above, and any and all negotiations, documents and discussions associated with it shall be without prejudice

statute or law, of any liability or wrongdoing by ABI, of the District of Columbia Court's having jurisdiction over ABI 
266 F. Supp. 2d 44, *76; 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9557, **92

thereof shall not be discoverable or used directly or indirectly by the Class or any third party, in any way (except that 
the provisions of this Settlement Agreement may be used by the parties to enforce the provisions of the Settlement 
Agreement), whether in this Action, the Related Actions, or in any other action or proceeding. The parties expressly 
reserve all their rights if this Settlement Agreement does not become final substantially in accordance with the 
terms of this Settlement Agreement.
VII. TERMINATION
A. Effect of Exclusion by Class Members. 
1. If, after notice [**97]  of the Settlement is sent to the Class, Class Members with aggregate Taxol Payments 
exceeding a percentage set forth in a confidential letter from Lead Counsel to ABI's counsel (""Confidential 
Percentage"") of the TPP Total Aggregate Taxol Payments exclude themselves from the Class, then ABI may, 
at its option terminate this Settlement Agreement. The parties agree to negotiate in good faith to determine 
whether the Confidential Percentage has been exceeded. If the parties cannot resolve the matter through 
negotiation by September 15, 2003, then the parties agree to submit the issue to the Court by September 22, 
2003, and shall request that the Court resolve the issue by October 3, 2003. The Court's resolution of this issue 
shall be final and all parties waive any right to appeal.
2. To be effective, ABI's right to terminate this Settlement Agreement pursuant to Paragraph VII.A. must be 
exercised by giving written notice to Lead Counsel within five (5) business days of: (i) the Settling Parties 
agreeing in writing that the percentage in the confidential letter has been exceeded, or, if applicable, (ii) the 
Court's determination of the matter.
B. Effect of Disapproval
If [**98]  the Court does not finally approve this Settlement Agreement in its entirety, or if such approval is materially 
modified or set aside on appeal, or if the Court does not enter the final judgment substantially in the form provided 
for in Paragraph IV.C. above, or if the Court enters the final judgment and appellate review is sought and, on such 
review, such final judgment is not affirmed or is affirmed with material modifications, then this Settlement 
Agreement may be terminated upon the election of ABI or Lead Counsel. A modification or reversal on appeal of 
any amount of Class Counsel's fees and expenses  [*79]  awarded by the Court from the Settlement Fund shall not 
be deemed a modification of all or a part of the terms of this Settlement Agreement or such final judgment and shall 
not give rise to any right of termination.
C. Termination
If this Settlement Agreement is terminated pursuant to Paragraphs VII.A. or VII.B above, or does not become final 
pursuant to Paragraph IV.D. above for any reason, then the Settlement Fund, net of (i) taxes paid or reimbursed or 
due to be paid or reimbursed on the Settlement Fund, (ii) the costs paid or incurred for administering the Settlement 
Fund, [**99]  and (iii) the expenses paid or incurred for providing notice to the Class, (a) shall be returned to ABI; 
(b) the Settlement Agreement shall be of no force or effect, except for payment of notice and administrative fees 
and costs from the Settlement Fund; (c) any release pursuant to Paragraph VI.A. shall be of no force or effect; and 
(d) the parties shall request that the Court vacate any order certifying the Class. The parties expressly reserve all of 
their rights if this Settlement Agreement is terminated or does not become final.

or practice that violates any antitrust statute, unfair and deceptive trade practices statute or other law or that ABI is 
subject to jurisdiction in the District of Columbia. Neither this Settlement Agreement, nor any negotiations preceding 
it, nor any proceedings undertaken in accordance with the terms set forth herein; shall be construed as or deemed

Representatives or the Class have or could have asserted against it or as to any liability by it, which liability is 
hereby expressly denied and disclaimed by ABI. Neither this Settlement Agreement, nor any of its provisions, nor 
any statement or document made or filed in connection herewith, shall be filed, offered, received in evidence or 
otherwise used in any action or proceeding or any arbitration, except in connection with the parties' application for

mailing of such materials, then the parties agree to revise any dates herein,  [*80]  as necessary due to the 
changed date, in a writing signed by both parties. Furthermore, the parties agree, if it becomes reasonably 
necessary under the circumstances, to work together in good faith to revise dates herein by a writing signed by both

or the settlement does not become final pursuant to Paragraph IV.D., or is terminated [**102]  pursuant to 
Paragraphs VII.A. or VII.B. above, discovery will resume in this Action and the Related Actions in a reasonable 
manner to be approved by the Court.
E. Consent to Jurisdiction
ABI, Third-Party Payor Class Representatives and Class Counsel hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive 
jurisdiction of the Court only for the specific purpose of any suit, action, proceeding or dispute arising out of or 
relating to this Settlement Agreement, the applicability of this Settlement Agreement or any issue related to fees 
and costs. ABI does not waive and specifically preserves its objection to the Court exercising jurisdiction over it in 
the event the Settlement Agreement is not approved by the Court, the settlement does not become final pursuant to 
Paragraph IV.D. or the settlement is terminated pursuant to Paragraphs VII.
F. Resolution of Disputes: Retention of Jurisdiction 
Any disputes between or among ABI and any Class Members concerning matters contained in this Settlement 
Agreement shall, if they cannot be resolved by negotiation and agreement, be submitted to the Court. The Court 
shall retain jurisdiction over the implementation and enforcement of this Settlement [**103]  Agreement.

THIS NOTICE EXPLAINS YOUR RIGHTS PLEASE READ IT CAREFULLY
To: Third-Party Payors in the United States that, at any time from January 1, 1999 through December 31, 
2002, purchased  [*82]  Taxol tm and/or generic paclitaxel in the United States.
I. PURPOSE OF NOTICE
The parties to the aboce-captioned class action (""Action""), pending before the Honorable Emmet G. Sullivan in the 
United States District Court for the District of Columbia (""Court""), have agreed to a Settlement, described in more 
detail in Section IV below. The Settlement is subject to approval by the Court.
The purpose of this Notice is to inform Third-Party Payor members of the Settlement Class (described below), for 
whose benefit the Action has been prosecuted, of their rights. The provisions in this Notice are qualified and subject 
in their entirety to the terms of the Stipulations of [**107]  Settlement, copies of which are available for review in the 
manner provided in Section XI below. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meanings given to 
them in the Stipulations of Settlement.
II. THE SETTLEMENT CLASS
The ""Settlement Class"" or ""Class,"" which this Court has conditionally certified for the purposes of the Settlement, 
consists of all Third-Party Payors in the United States which, at any time from January 1, 1999 through December 
31, 2002, paid, in which or in part, for Taxol and/or generic paclitaxel in the United States. Excluded from the Class 
are Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (""Bristol"") and American BioScience, Inc. (""ABI"") (collectively, ""Defendants""), 
their subsidiaries, affiliates, officers and directors and government entities.
A ""Third-Party Payor,"" for there purposes, means any entity that (a) is a party to a contract, issuer of a policy or 
sponsor of a plan, which contract, policy or plan provides coverage for the administration of Taxol or generic 
paclitaxel to natural persons, and (b) is also at risk, pursuant to such contract, policy, or plan, to pay or reimburse all 
of part of the costs or providing such coverage. Entities with [**108]  self-funded plans that contract with a health

266 F. Supp. 2d 44, *81; 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9557, **105

 
benefits may qualify as Third-Party Payors. Furthermore, a self-funded health benefit plan for employees of a 
government entity that satisfies the definition of ""Third-Party Payor"" shall not be considered a ""government entity.""
III. BACKGROUND TO THIS LITIGATION
Vista Healthplan, Inc., a Third-Party Payor, and Ramona Sakiestewa, an individual, filed antitrust, consumer 
protectioon and unjust enrichment claims against Defendants Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and American BioScience, 
Inc., alleging that they engaged in wrongful and anti-competitive conduct by improperly extending Bristol's 
monopoly over the market for paclitaxel, a cancer drug sold under the brand name Taxol. The crux of the 
allegations is that Defendants engaged in wrongful, deceptive and illegal conduct to keep generic versions of 
paclitaxel off the market.
This Action was filed on June 11, 2001. Preparation for the filing of this and related actions began as early as June 
1998. In June 2002, the Attorneys General of several states brought an action [**109]  against Bristol on behalf of 
consumers (""States Action""). 1 In November 2001, Oncology & Radiation Associates, P.A. brought a class  [*83]  
action against Defendants on behalf of all direct purchasers (""Directs Action""). 2
 [**110]  Since the filing of this Action, Vista and Class Counsel have engaged in an extensive investigation relating 
to the claims and underlying events alleged in the Complaint. Among other things, Class Counsel have: (1) 
reviewed and analyzed thousands of documents produved by Bristol, ABI and third parties; (2) engaged in legal 
research and analysis of a myrid of issues relating to class certification, liability, casuation and damages; (3) briefed 
substantive motions on liability and class certification; and (4) retained and consulted with economists and other 
experts with respect to causation and damages allegedly sustained by the Class as a result of the wrongful conduct 
alleged in the Complaint. Class Counsel are therefore thorough;y familiar with issues of class certification, liability, 
causation and damages with respect to the claims asserted in the Complaint and defenses asserted by Bristol and 
ABI.
IV. PROPOSED SETTLEMENT OF THE ACTION
After extensive negotiations among the attorneys for the parties to the Action, the parties have agreed to a 
Settlement of the Action (""Settlement""), subject to approval by the court. Defendants deny all wrongdoing. The 
parties agree that [**111]  the Stipulations of Settlement shall not be deemed or construed to be an admission or 
evidence of any violation of any statute or law or of any liability or wrongdoing or the truth of any of the claims or 
allegations in the Action. The terms and consitions of the Settlement are incorporated in two Stipulations of 
Settlement both dated May 27, 2003. The Stipulation of Settlement are on file with the Court. They are also posted 
on the settlement website at www.taxolppsettlement.com and can also be reviewed as more fully described below 
in Section XI. The following is a summary description of the Stipulations of Settlement.
The Stipulations of Settlement provide the following:

December 31, 2002. Brustol is paying $ 15,000,000 and ABI is paying $ 185,000. The Settlement Fund, less certain

related action, not to exceed $ 50,000 per plaintiff; (3) costs of providinf notice to the Third-Party Payor members of 
the Settlement Class; and (4) certain escrow agent and claims administration fees associated with the Settlement

timely and  [*84]  valid Proofs of Claim. The Third-Party Payor Proof of Claim accompanies this Notice, and must 
contain the information requested therein, in accordance with the terms described below. The amount of the Third-
Party Payor Settlement Fund is subject to the Settlement Reduction and Termination Contingencies described 
below.
Third-Party Payors may be required, as a condition of participation in the recovery, to present evidence of their 
purchases of Taxol and/or generic paclitaxel during the period January 1, 1998 through January 31, 2003 (the 
""Claim Period""). You should, therefore, preserve invoices and other records reflecting such purchases.
The award of attorneys' fees to Class Counsel is a matter committed to the sole discretion of the Court. Class 
Counsel's request to the [**113]  Court for reasonable attorneys' fees will not exceed one-third (33 1/3%) of the 
difference between the Settlement Fund and certain amounts required to be repaid to Bristol pursuant to the 
Settlement Reduction Contingency described below and more particularly set forth in the Stipulations of Settlement 
(""Reversion Amounts""), plus up to twenty percent (20%) of such Reversion Amounts.

(1) All Class Members' timely and valid claims shall be valued as follows: The sum of all Taxol Payments 3 
multiplied by seventeen percent (17%). This amount shall be referred to as the Class Member's ""Recognized 
Loss.""
(2) To satisfy the Recognized Loss of Non-J-Code Class Members,4 one million and five hundred and thirty 
thousand dollars ($ 1,530,000) of the Net Settlement Fund shall be set aside as the Preferential Fund.

Net Settlement Fund as follows:
3 ""Taxol Payments"" shall mean the dollar amount of purchases of the brand-name prescription drug Taxol and generic paclitaxel 
(not including any dispensing fee), less any reimbursements (including co-payments), rebates or discounts, during the Class 
Period. For the purposes of this Settlement Agreement, a Third-Party Payor ""purchases"" Taxol or generic paclitaxel if they paid 
or reimbursed some or all of the purchase price. ""Taxol Payments"" shall not include any fees for the administration of Taxol or 
generic paclitaxel.
4 Non-J-Code Class Members"" shall mean those members of the Class that are not J-Code Class Members. Nothing herein 
prevents a Class Member who utilized more than one reimbursement or payment system at the same time during the Class 
Period from being considered both a J-Code Class Member and a Non-J-Code Class Member, and therefore having its claims 
satisfied accordingly under the Allocation and Distribution Plan.
5 ""J-Code Class Member"" shall mean any member of the Class that utilized a reimbursement or payment system for Taxol 
Payments during all or part of the Class Period that employed, or was based upon, a J-Code Medicare Fee Schedule (or any 
similar reimbursement or payment system). Nothing herein prevents a Class Member who utilized more than one reimbursement 
of payment system during the Class Period from being considered both a J-Code Class Member and a Non-J-Code Class 
Member, and therefore having its claims satisfied accordingly under the Allocation and Distribution Plan. ""J-Code Medicare Fee 
Schedule"" shall mean a fee schedule used by or authorized by the Health Care Financing Administration, Centers for Medicare 
& Medicaid Services, and/or Medicare that employed a Code of ""J9265"" to represent Taxol or generic paclitaxel and listed fees

 [*85]  (a) The Recognized Loss of Non-J-Code Class Members shall first be paid out of the 
Preferential [**114]  Fund on a pro-rata basis; 
(b) To the extent that the Recognized Loss of Non-J-Code Class Members is not one hundred percent 
(100%) satisfied from the Preferential Fund, the unsatisfied amounts of the Recognized Loss of the Non-J-
Code Class Members will be paid from the Non-Preferential Fund 6 together with the Recognized Loss of 
J-Code Class Members on a pro-rata basis.
(c) If the Recognized Loss of Non-J-Code Class Members is one hundred percent (100%) satisfied from 
the Preferential Fund, and there remains money in the Preferential Fund, the remaining money will be 
added to the Non-Preferential Fund for payment of J-Code Class Members' Recognized Loss on a pro-
rata basis.
 [**115]  
 [**116]  
To the extent that a Class Member used more than one reimbursement or payment system during the Class Period; 
and further, has valid claims as a Non-J-Code Class Member for only part of the Class Period, that Class Member's 
claims shall be allocated as follows: (1) the Class Member shall disclose, if applicable, the date when the Class 
Member switched to or from using a reimbursement or payment system based on a J-Code Medicare Fee Schedule 
(or any similar reimbursement or payment system),. together with any other information relevant to determining the 
proportion of its Taxol Payments that were made under a Non-J-Code reimbursement or payment system (or similar

Member's [**117]  actual breakdown of Taxol Payments of, if applicable, calculate the percentage of the Class

a J-Code Class Member and a Non-J-Code Member, according to its actual breakdown of Taxol Payments or 
percentage determined in subsection (2) above, if applicable.

Fund may be required to be repaid to Bristol based, in part, upon Taxol and/or generic paclitaxel purchases of

Definitions:
 [*94]  ""J-Code Class Member"" shall mean any member of the Class that utilized a reimbursement or payment 
system for Taxol Payments during all or part of the Class Period that employed,  [**139]  or was based upon, a J-
Code Medicare Fee Schedule (or any similar reimbursement or payment system). Nothing herein prevents a Class 
Member who utilized more than one reimbursement or payment system during the Class Period from being 
considered both a J-Code Class Member and a Non-J-Code Class Member, and therefore having its claims 
satisfied accordingly under the Allocation and Distribution Plan.
""J-Code Medicare Fee Schedule"" shall mean a fee schedule used by or authored by the Health Care Financing 
Administration, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and/or Medicare that employed a Code of ""J9265"" to 
represent Taxol or generic paclitaxel and listed fees for J9265 that did not change during the Class Period.
""Non-J-Code Class Members"" shall mean those members of the Class that are not J-Code Class Members. 
Nothing herein prevents a Class Member who utilized more than one reimbursement or payment system at the 
same time during the Class Period from being considered both a J-Code Class Member and a Non-J-Code Class 
Member, and therefore having its claims satisfied accordingly under the Allocation and Distribution Plan.
""Taxol Payments"" shall mean [**140]  the dollar amount of purchases of the brand-name prescription drug Taxol 
and generic paclitaxel (not including any dispensing fee), less any reimbursements (including co-payments), 
rebates or discounts, during the Class Period. For the purposes of this Settlement Agreement, a Third-Party Payor 
""purchases"" Taxol or generic paclitaxel if they paid or reimbursed some or all of the purchase price. ""Taxol 
Payments"" shall not include any fees for the administration of Taxol or generic paclitaxel.
""Class Period"" shall mean January 1, 1999 through December 31, 2002.

Possession and use of a fraudulently acquired patent is not a per se violation of the Sherman Act but can be treated 
as an offense under the antitrust laws if the patent was employed to produce monopoly power in a specified market.
Antitrust & Trade Law > ... > Private Actions > Remedies > General Overview

Only an actual competitor or one ready to be a competitor can suffer antitrust injury.
Antitrust & Trade Law > ... > Private Actions > Remedies > General Overview

Standing to bring an antitrust action is a requirement because antitrust injury is a necessary element of an antitrust 
suit. A ""nascent"" business, one that is merely a gleam in the eye and a hope in the heart of its promoters, does not 
possess the property to which antitrust injury can be done."
