Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.S. § 1, provides that every contract, combination in the form of trust or 
otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce is declared to be illegal. Despite its broad language, § 1 
only prohibits contracts, combinations, or conspiracies that unreasonably restrain trade. Certain restraints of trade 
are per se unreasonable, while others require more searching analysis under the rule of reason.

HN3[
]  Price Fixing & Restraints of Trade, Per Se Rule & Rule of Reason
Restraints of trade are per se unreasonable when they are manifestly anticompetitive or would always or almost 
always tend to restrict competition. Because of their pernicious effect on competition and lack of any redeeming 
virtue, these restraints of trade are conclusively presumed to unreasonably restrain competition without elaborate 
inquiry as to the precise harm it has caused or the business excuse for its use.

Horizontal restraints of trade are per se unreasonable. Whatever economic justification particular price-fixing 
agreements may be thought to have, the law does not permit an inquiry into their reasonableness. Such restraints 
are all banned because of their actual or potential threat to the central nervous system of the economy.

The existence of an agreement is the very essence of a claim under 15 U.S.C.S. § 1. The Sherman Act is 
interpreted to require some form of concerted action. There must be a unity of purpose or a common design and 
understanding or a meeting of minds, or a conscious commitment to a common scheme.

HN8[
]  Summary Judgment, Opposing Materials
When faced with whether a plaintiff has offered son a 15 U.S.C.S. § 1 claim, a court must generally apply the same 
summary judgment standards that apply in other contexts. A court shall render summary judgment when the 
evidence shows that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to 
judgment as a matter of law. Fed R. Civ. P. 56(c). In making this determination, a court must view the facts and any 
reasonable inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment. The 
court should not tightly compartmentalize the evidence put forward by the nonmoving party, but instead should 
analyze it as a whole to see if it supports an inference of concerted action.

HN9[
]  Summary Judgment, Opposing Materials
Antitrust law limits the range of permissible inferences from ambiguous evidence in a case brought under 15 
U.S.C.S. § 1. In other words, certain inferences may not be drawn from circumstantial evidence in an antitrust case. 
That higher threshold is imposed in antitrust cases to avoid deterring innocent conduct that reflects enhanced, 
rather than restrained, competition. The evidentiary limitation does not apply where the plaintiff provides direct 
evidence of a conspiracy, no inferences are required from direct evidence to establish a fact and thus a court need 
not be concerned about the reasonableness of the inferences to be drawn from such evidence.

HN10[
]  Price Fixing & Restraints of Trade, Cartels & Horizontal Restraints
Courts are cautious in accepting inferences from circumstantial evidence in cases involving allegations of horizontal 
price-fixing among oligopolists. The basis for this circumspect approach is the theory of interdependence.
Antitrust & Trade Law > ... > Price Fixing & Restraints of Trade > Cartels & Horizontal Restraints > General 
Overview
HN11[
]  Price Fixing & Restraints of Trade, Cartels & Horizontal Restraints
The theory of interdependence posits the following: In a market with many firms, the effects of any single firm's 
price and output decisions would be so diffused among its numerous competitors that they would not be aware of 
any change. In a highly concentrated market dominated by few firms, however, any single firm's price and output 
decisions will have a noticeable impact on the market and on its rivals. Thus when a firm in a concentrated market, 
that is, an ""oligopolist"" is deciding on a course of action, any rational decision must take into account the anticipated 
reaction of the other firms.

The Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.S. § 1 et seq., does not proscribe noncompetitive ""conscious parallelism.""
Antitrust & Trade Law > ... > Price Fixing & Restraints of Trade > Cartels & Horizontal Restraints > General 
Overview
HN14[
]  Price Fixing & Restraints of Trade, Cartels & Horizontal Restraints
Conscious parallelism is described as the process, not in itself unlawful, by which firms in a concentrated market 
might in effect share monopoly power, setting their prices at a profit-maximizing, supracompetitive level by 
recognizing their shared economic interests and their interdependence with respect to price and output decisions.
Antitrust & Trade Law > ... > Price Fixing & Restraints of Trade > Cartels & Horizontal Restraints > General 
Overview
HN15[
]  Price Fixing & Restraints of Trade, Cartels & Horizontal Restraints
To establish illegal concerted action based on consciously parallel behavior, a plaintiff must show (1) that the 
defendants' behavior was parallel; (2) that the defendants were conscious of each other's conduct and that this 
awareness was an element in their decisionmaking process; and (3) certain ""plus"" factors. Courts have identified at 
least three such plus factors: (1) evidence that the defendant had a motive to enter into a price fixing conspiracy; (2) 
evidence that the defendant acted contrary to its interests; and (3) evidence implying a traditional conspiracy.
Antitrust & Trade Law > Sherman Act > General Overview
Antitrust & Trade Law > ... > Price Fixing & Restraints of Trade > Cartels & Horizontal Restraints > General 
Overview
HN16[
]  Antitrust & Trade Law, Sherman Act
Evidence that the defendant had a motive to enter into a price fixing conspiracy means evidence that the industry is 
conducive to oligopolistic price fixing, either interdependently or through a more express form of collusion. In other 
words, it is evidence that the structure of the market was such as to make secret price fixing feasible. Evidence that 
the defendant acted contrary to its interests means evidence of conduct that would be irrational assuming that the 
defendant operated in a competitive market. In a competitive industry, a firm would cut its price with the hope of 
increasing its market share if its competitors were setting prices above marginal costs. In analyzing this factor, a 
court looks to evidence that the market behaved in a noncompetitive manner.

]  Antitrust & Trade Law, Sherman Act
The most important evidence of a plus factor as evidence of a price fixing conspiracy is generally noneconomic 
evidence that there was an actual, manifest agreement not to compete. That evidence may involve customary 
indications of traditional conspiracy, or proof that the defendants got together and exchanged assurances of 
common action or otherwise adopted a common plan even though no meetings, conversations, or exchanged 
documents are shown.

As a general matter, a court should allow a witness to invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege only if the hazard of 
incrimination is substantial and real, and not merely trifling or imaginary. However, the trial judge should order the 
witness to answer questions only if it is perfectly clear, from a careful consideration of all the circumstances in the 
case that the answer cannot possibly tend to incriminate the witness.
