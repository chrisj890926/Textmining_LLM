6 Eleven days following the execution of the Moark Settlement, the parties executed a First Addendum to Settlement Agreement 
Between Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs and Defendants Moark, LLC, Norco Ranch, Inc. and Land O'Lakes, Inc. Mot., Ex. 1B (Doc. 
No. 465-4). The Addendum extended the date that obliged Moark to transfer the Settlement Amount to an escrow account from 
ten days following the execution date of the Moark Settlement to sixteen days. Id.

Plaintiffs filed the motion sub judice, and the Court held the final fairness hearing on the Moark Settlement as 
required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(2). See Moark Final Approval Hr'g Tr. (Doc. No. 688) (hereinafter, ""Final Hr'g Tr.""). 
No objections were filed to the proposed Moark Agreement. No objectors appeared at the fairness hearing. 
Plaintiffs filed supplemental briefing and materials in support of their motion for final approval. Following the 
hearing, the Court withheld ruling on the motion until the notice period required pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1715(d) 
under the Class Action Fairness Act (""CAFA"") had elapsed. After the expiration of the notice period, Plaintiffs filed a 
motion for approval of attorneys' fees, which the Court will address apart from this Memorandum.
II. Proposed Moark Settlement Agreement7
The proposed Settlement Class for settlement purposes under the Moark Settlement is defined as:
All persons and entities that purchased eggs, including Shell Eggs and Egg Products, produced from caged 
birds in the United States directly from any Producer, including any Defendant, during the Class Period from 
January 1, 2000 through the date when notice of the Court's entry of an order preliminarily approving this 
settlement and certifying a Class for settlement purposes is first published.
a.) Shell Egg SubClass
All individuals and entities that purchased Shell Eggs produced from caged birds in the United States 
directly from any Producer including any Defendant, during the Class Period from January 1, 2000 through 
the date when notice of the Court's entry of an order preliminarily approving this settlement and certifying a 
Class for settlement purposes is first published, excluding individuals and entities that purchased only 
""specialty"" Shell Eggs (certified organic, nutritionally enhanced, cage-free, free-range,  [**11] and 
vegetarian-fed types) and ""hatching"" Shell Eggs (used by poultry breeders to produce breeder stock or 
growing stock for laying hens or meat).
b.) Egg Products SubClass
All individuals and entities that purchased Egg Products produced from Shell Eggs that came from caged 
birds in the United States directly from any Producer, including any Defendant, during the Class Period 
from January 1, 2000 through the date when notice of the Court's entry of an order preliminarily approving 
this settlement and certifying a Class for settlement purposes is first published, excluding individuals and 
entities that purchased only ""specialty"" Egg Products (certified organic, nutritionally enhanced, cage-free, 
free-range, and vegetarian-fed types).
Excluded from the Class and SubClasses are Producers, and their respective parents, subsidiaries and 
affiliates, all government entities, as well as the Court and staff to whom this case is assigned, and any 
member of the Court's or staff's immediate family.
Mot., Ex. A, Settlement Agreement Between Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs and Defendants Moark, LLC, Norco Ranch, 
Inc., and Land O'Lakes, Inc. ¶ 19 (hereinafter, ""Moark Settlement Agreement""). As mentioned  [**12] earlier, the 
Court preliminarily certified the Settlement Class for settlement purposes under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3). See Moark 
Preliminary  [*255] Approval Order. The agreement's principal terms require Moark to pay the Settlement Amount of 
twenty-five million dollars ($25,000,000). See Moark Settlement Agreement ¶¶ 15, 33. The Settlement Amount has 
been deposited into an interest-bearing escrow account. See Bernstein Decl. ¶ 15; Fees Mot. at 2. Any interest, net 
realized gains and other earnings accrued on the Settlement Amount are part of the funds available for 
disbursement to the Class and Subclass Members. See Moark Settlement Agreement ¶ 33; Moark Settlement 
Agreement, Ex. A, Escrow Agreement, Schedule A, at 1-4 (Doc. No. 690-1) (hereinafter, ""Escrow Agreement"").
7 The  [**10] terms used in this Order that are defined in the Moark Settlement Agreement are, unless otherwise defined herein, 
used in this Order consistent with the definitions of the agreement.
284 F.R.D. 249, *254; 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98301, **9

 
According to the Notice of the Moark Settlement, which is discussed in more detail, infra, the Settlement Amount, 
with any interest earned, and less administrative expenses, escrow expenses, taxes, and attorneys' fees, will be 
distributed on a pro rata basis to the settlement class members who timely and properly submit a valid Claim Form, 
which is a form documenting a member's claim for damages. See Mot., Ex. 2.1, Notice of Moark Settlement at 3-4 
 [**13] (Doc. No. 465-8) (hereinafter, ""Moark Notice""); see also Mot. at Ex. 2.1, Moark Claim Form (hereinafter, 
""Claim Form""); Escrow Agreement at 3-4. The pro rata share is based upon the dollar amount of a Class Members' 
direct purchases of shell egg and egg products in the United States from any producer, including Defendants, 
during the period designated in the Agreement. See Notice at 3; Claim Form at 1. The Claims Notice provided that 
""[b]ecause the alleged overcharge is only a portion of the price paid for eggs and egg products, your recovery will 
be less than the total amount you paid."" Notice at 3. 8
Additionally, pursuant to the agreement, Moark will cooperate with the Plaintiffs' preparation for and prosecution of 
their class action. See Moark Settlement Agreement ¶ 39. The Agreement details the extent of Moark's cooperation 
in terms  [**14] of production of certain non-privileged documents and ensuring the availability of current Moark 
directors, officers, and employees to give non-privileged testimony through interviews, depositions, declarations and 
affidavits, and appearance at trial. See id. Moark also agrees to assist Plaintiffs in arranging for non-privileged 
testimony from former directors, officers, and employees. See id. ¶ 39(b).
In consideration, Plaintiffs agree that they ""shall not . . . seek to recover against [Moark] for any of the Released 
Claims."" Id. ¶ 25. Under the Agreement, ""Released Claims"" are defined as any and all claims arising out of injuries 
or damages that occurred ""from the beginning of time to the date when notice of the Court's entry of an order 
preliminarily approving this Agreement is first published"" and that resulted from the conduct asserted in the 
Plaintiffs' suit. See id. The Agreement delineates the conduct asserted by the Plaintiffs' suit as: ""(i) any agreement 
or understanding between or among two or more Producers of eggs, including any Defendants, including any 
entities or individuals that may later be added as a defendant to the Action, (ii) the reduction or restraint of supply, 
 [**15] the reduction of or restrictions on production capacity, or (ii) the pricing, selling, discounting, marketing, or 
distributing of Shell Eggs and Egg Products in the United States or elsewhere."" Id. The Agreement sets forth non-
exclusive examples of Released Claims by providing that such claims ""includ[e] but [are] not limited to any conduct 
alleged, and causes of action asserted, or that could have been alleged or asserted, whether or not concealed or 
hidden, in the Complaints filed in the Action, which in whole or in part arise from or are related to the facts and/or 
actions described in the Complaints, including under any federal or state antirust, unfair competition, unfair 
practices, price discrimination, unitary pricing, trade practice, consumer protection, fraud, RICO, civil conspiracy 
law, or similar laws, including without limitation, the Sherman Antitrust Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1 et seq."" Id. Plaintiffs also 
agree to waive California Civil Code Section 1542  [*256] and similar provisions in other states. Id. ¶ 26. 
Additionally, Plaintiffs agree to waive and release ""all defenses, rights, and benefits that [Plaintiffs] may have or that 
may have been derived from the provisions of applicable  [**16] law which, absent such waiver, may limit the extent 
or effect of the release"" of the aforementioned claims. Id. ¶ 27. The release excludes ""claims relating to payment 
disputes, physical harm, defective product or bodily injury . . . and do[es] not include any Non-Settling Defendant."" 
Id. ¶ 28.
The settlement proposes an opt-out provision which sets forth the procedures through which possible class 
members could opt out of the settlement. Id. ¶ 22; see also Moark Notice at 1, 5-6. Class members had 75 days 
from the postmark date that the notice of the settlement was mailed by first-class mail to the final postmark date 
designated in the Claims Notice to return an exclusion request. See Moark Notice at 1, 5-6. Class Members had 
127 days from the postmark date that the notice of the settlement was mailed by first-class mail to the final 
postmark date designated in the Claims Notice to return a completed Claim Form to make a claim for benefits. See 
id. at 3-4.
Finally, the parties set forth certain provisions in their agreement concerning attorneys' fees, specifically:
8 The agreement provided that Settlement Fund may be reduced if ""class members whose sales equal 7.5% or more of the total 
US egg sales"" opt out of the Moark Settlement. Moark Notice at 3. However, this reduction provision is inapplicable because the 
condition that would otherwise trigger that provision did not occur. See Final Hr'g Tr. at 35:10-35:20.
284 F.R.D. 249, *255; 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98301, **10

 
Class Counsel may seek an award of attorneys' fees and reasonable litigation expenses approved by the 
Court, to be paid out  [**17] of the Settlement Amount after the Final Approval of the Agreement. Moark 
Defendants agree not to object to Class Counsel's petition to the Court for payment of attorneys' fees, costs, 
and expenses from the Settlement Amount. The Moark Defendants shall have no obligation to pay any fees or 
expenses from Class Counsel.
Moark Settlement Agreement ¶ 35.
III. Notice
Notice of the Moark Settlement was disseminated to possible members of the Settlement Class through a variety of 
means ranging from direct mailings, publications, press releases, a website and a toll-free information and request 
telephone line. See Mot., Ex. 2, Affidavit of Jennifer M. Keough re: Notice and Settlement Administration ¶¶ 5-6 
(Doc. No. 465-7) (hereinafter, ""Keough Aff.""); see also Moark Settlement Agreement ¶ 21. The Notice explained 
that any possible Class Members wishing to be excluded from or to object to the terms of the Moark Settlement 
Agreement should postmark their exclusion requests or objections no later than a specific date that was 104 days 
before the final fairness hearing on the Moark Settlement. See Moark Notice at 1, 5-6. A maximum of $350,000 of 
the Settlement Amount was authorized to be used for  [**18] costs of notice. See Moark Settlement Agreement ¶ 
45. Ultimately, $170,000 was spent on notice expenses with respect to the Moark Settlement Agreement. See Final 
Hr'g Tr. at 30:21-30-23. No other information has been provided to the Court concerning whether other 
administrative costs and expenses were (or were not) incurred.
The Claims Administrator received 905 Claim forms by the time of the hearing for final approval of the settlement; 
881 of those Claim Forms met the deadline set forth for filing such forms and 24 Claim Forms did not. See Final 
Hr'g Tr. 14:4-14:6. 9 The Claims Administrator received no objections to the settlement and received 150 requests 
for exclusion from the class. See id. at 14:7-14:9. Some of those parties who opted-out of the class have filed their 
own complaints against Defendants, including Moark, such as Direct Action Plaintiffs Giant Eagle Inc., Winn-Dixie 
Stores, Inc., Roundy's Supermarkets, Inc., C&S Wholesale Grocers, Inc., and H.J. Heinz Company, L.P., as well as 
plaintiffs in a state court action proceeding in Kansas. See Am. Compl. (Doc. No. 623) (Giant Eagle Inc.); Second 
Am. Compl. (Doc. No. 622) (Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc., Roundy's  [*257] Supermarkets,  [**19] Inc., C&S Wholesale 
Grocers, Inc., and H.J. Heinz Company, L.P.), Dec. 19, 2011 Mem. and Order, 836 F. Supp. 2d 290, 2011 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 146258, 2011 WL 6396462, at *5 n.8 (Doc. Nos. 601 and 602) (explaining that six direct purchasers 
opted out of the Sparboe and Moark Settlements and filed an action against Defendants in Kansas state court, 
which, after being removed to federal court by Defendants, was remanded to state court); Direct Action Plaintiff 
Status Report (Doc. No. 457). 10 Interim Co-Lead Counsel has represented that the ""potential Class is composed of 
9 The Plaintiff's Motion stated that 894 Claim Forms had been submitted. See Keough Aff. ¶ 16. However, because the Plaintiffs 
provided updated numbers during their presentation in the final fairness hearing, the Court references those numbers here. 
Plaintiffs intend to make recommendations as to the treatment of late Claims Forms in a plan of allocation that will be submitted 
for the Court's approval.
10 The Direct Action Plaintiff Status Report states that ""[a]ll of the Direct Action Plaintiffs except Giant Eagle have remained in the 
Moark class  [**20] settlement based on the statements in the Moark Class Settlement Agreement and Notice that remaining in 
that settlement class ""does not prejudice their rights to exclude themselves from any other past, present or future settlement 
class or certified litigation class"" in this case. To be clear, only Giant Eagle has opted out of the Moark settlement class."" Id. at 2. 
This statement applies only to the presently pending Direct Action Plaintiff cases brought by The Kroger Co. and co-plaintiffs 
(Civil Action No. 10-7605 (E.D. Pa.)), Supervalu Inc. (Civil Action No. 10-6736 (E.D. Pa.)), Publix Super Markets, Inc. (Civil 
Action No. 10-6737 (E.D. Pa.)), and Giant Eagle, Inc. (Civil Action No. 10-1698 (W.D. Pa.)).
The statement does not apply to the pending Direct Action Plaintiff cases brought by Kraft Foods Global, Inc. and its co-plaintiffs 
(Civil Action No. 11-8808 (E.D. Pa.), and Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc. (Civil Action No. 11-0510 (E.D. Pa.). Both of these cases were 
filed after the Status Report. However, because Kraft Foods Global, Inc. and its co-plaintiffs' names do not appear on the list of 
names of those parties who filed requests for exclusion from the Moark Settlement, Exhibit 4 to  [**21] the Plaintiffs' Motion (Doc. 
No. 465-10), it appears that this group of Direct Action Plaintiffs did not opt-out of the Moark Settlement. However, the names of 
284 F.R.D. 249, *256; 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98301, **16

 
thousands of entities nationwide, many of which are sophisticated companies with their own in-house legal 
counsel."" Fees Mot. at 12.
The Claims Administrator mailed Notice and Claim Forms to 13,211 direct purchasers of shell eggs and egg 
products, whose names and addresses were obtained from various electronic data files that contained potential 
Class Member names and addresses from 17 named egg producer Defendants that were given to the Claims 
Administrator at the direction of the Court. See Keough Aff. ¶ 7, 9; Notice Approval Order ¶ 3. Eighty-three (83) 
Notice and Claim Forms, returned by the U.S. Postal Service with forwarding address information, were re-mailed. 
See id. ¶ 12. In contrast, twenty-three hundred thirty-three (2,333) Notice and  [**22] Claim Forms were returned 
without forwarding address information and, according to Interim Co-Lead Counsel, could not be re-mailed. See id. 
11
Additionally, during the notice period a Summary Notice was published in several publications with a total circulation 
of over 2,316,000. See id. ¶ 11. The Summary Notice was published in a monthly issue of fifteen (15) industry 
journals thought to be likely to reach potential purchasers of shell eggs and egg products. See id. Those 
publications are: PetFoodIndustry, Restaurant Business, Convenience Store News, Hotel F&B, Nation's Restaurant 
News, Food Service Director, Progressive Grocer, Food Manufacturing, Supermarket News, Stores, Egg Industry 
Magazine, Modern Baking, Baking Buyer, Food Processing, and Long Term Living. See id.
The Summary Notice was also published for one day in the Wall Street Journal. See id. That same day, the Claims 
Administrator distributed a press  [**23] release for the Moark Settlement, as well as a separate release about the 
Sparboe Settlement, to approximately 1,000 journalists in the restaurant and food industries through the US1 
Newsline on the PR Newswire. See id. ¶ 13. The press releases resulted in some 335 articles that reported on the 
two settlements. See id.
A publicly-available website specifically devoted to the Moark and Sparboe Settlements  [*258] was established. 
See id. ¶ 14. The website makes available for review and downloading the Notice Packet, the Moark Settlement 
Agreement, and various Court orders and filings relating to the Moark Settlement. See id. In the first 148 days of 
operation, the website received 4,820 ""visits."" See id.
The Claims Administrator and Plaintiffs established a toll-free 24-hour telephone number and call center for 
potential Class Members to obtain information about the settlement and to request the Notice and Claim Form. See 
id. ¶ 15. The automated number received 549 calls, and 95 callers requested and received a Notice Packet during 
the first 148 days of operation. See id.
Additionally, Moark served notice of the settlement to federal and state officials of the settlement as required by 28 
U.S.C. § 1715(d)  [**24] under CAFA. See Mot. at 9. No federal or state officials filed objections to the Moark 
Settlement, nor requested a hearing following the issuance of the CAFA notice. The statutory period elapsed prior 
to the date of this Memorandum and accompanying Order. 12
Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc. and its co-plaintiffs do appear on that list, and it appears they have opted out of the Settlement. See 
Keough Aff. ¶ 17.
Moark and Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc., Roundy's Supermarkets, Inc., C&S Wholesale Grocers, Inc., and H.J. Heinz Company, L.P. 
recently reported reaching a settlement of the claims against Moak and submitted a stipulation of dismissal that the Court is 
approving this same date.
11 The Court recognizes that the statistics provided here slightly differ with the equivalent statistics that the Plaintiffs provided in 
connection with their motion for approval of the Sparboe Settlement. However, the Court deems these minor differences to be 
inconsequential.
12 Although Moark served notice of the settlement to the appropriate officials, it did not do so promptly after the Agreement was 
filed, as required by 28 U.S.C. § 1715(b). Mot. at 9. Section 1715(b) provides: ""Not later than 10 days after a proposed 
settlement of a class action is filed in court, each defendant that is participating in the proposed settlement shall serve upon the 
appropriate State official of each State in which a class member resides and the appropriate Federal official, a notice of the 
284 F.R.D. 249, *257; 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98301, **21

 
Following approval of the settlement, Plaintiffs intend to submit for the Court's approval a plan of allocation relating 
to the Claims Administration process for evaluating the procedure for processing individual claims under the 
settlement, the allocation of the Settlement Fund distributions, administrative costs and expenses, and so forth. See 
Mot. at 1 n.1. The Claims Notice provided that the ""Court retains the power to approve or reject, in part or in full, 
any individual claim of a class member based on equitable grounds."" Moark Notice at 3. The Notice also stated that 
the Settlement Amount ""may be reduced by court-ordered attorneys' fees and reimbursement of litigation expenses, 
including administration of the Settlement, as approved by the Court"" and reduced ""by the expense of providing 
notice to the Class."" Id.
The  [**27] Claims Notice also explained that ""Class Counsel will apply to the Court for an award from the 
Settlement Funds of attorneys' fees and for reimbursement of litigation costs and expenses incurred, including fees 
and costs expended while providing Notice to the Class and while administering the Settlement Fund (including the 
plan of allocation)."" Id. at 4. The Notice stated that Interim Co-Lead Counsel intends to apply for attorneys' fees ""in 
an amount not to exceed thirty percent of $25 million as well as the costs and expenses incurred."" Id.
 [*259]  IV. Discussion
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 provides that ""[t]he claims, issues, or defenses of a certified class may be 
settled, voluntarily dismissed, or compromised only with the court's approval."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e). The following 
procedures apply to a proposed settlement, voluntary dismissal, or compromise:
(1) The court must direct notice in a reasonable manner to all class members who would be bound by the 
proposal.
(2) If the proposal would bind class members, the court may approve it only after a hearing and on finding that 
it is fair, reasonable, and adequate.
(3) The parties seeking approval must file a statement identifying any  [**28] agreement made in connection 
with the proposal.
(4) If the class action was previously certified under Rule 23(b)(3), the court may refuse to approve a 
settlement unless it affords a new opportunity to request exclusion to individual class members who had an 
earlier opportunity to request exclusion but did not do so.
(5) Any class member may object to the proposal if it requires court approval under this subdivision (e); the 
objection maybe withdrawn only with the court's approval.
proposed settlement . . . ."" Under Section 1715(d), an order granting final approval of a settlement agreement may not take 
place earlier than ninety days after the appropriate federal and state officials have been served with notice.
Plaintiffs advised the Court about the timing of the CAFA notice requirement on the Moark and Sparboe Settlements, and 
requested the Court proceed with the final approval hearing on the Moark Settlement  [**25] as scheduled and to hold its 
decision on the Plaintiffs' motion for final approval in abeyance until the ninety-day expiration date passed without any objections 
or requests for hearings being received from any relevant authority pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1715(d). See Mot. at 9. Over ninety 
days have elapsed since Moark served the appropriate state or federal officials with the CAFA notice, and there have been no 
requests for hearings or objections to the settlement made. It follows that, although the notice requirements under CAFA have 
not been fully met on a technical basis, the substance of the requirements have been satisfied insofar as giving federal and state 
officials sufficient notice and opportunity to be heard concerning the Moark Settlement. See D.S. ex rel. S.S. v. New York City 
Dep't of Educ., 255 F.R.D. 59, 80 (E.D.N.Y. 2008) (approving the settlement on a provisional basis until the CAFA notice 
deadline passes and no federal or state official requests a hearing); Kay Co. v. Equitable Prod. Co., No. 06 Civ. 00612, 2010 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 41892, 2010 WL 1734869, at *4 (S.D. W.Va. Apr. 28, 2010) (""Since more than 100 days have passed since 
service was perfected and since there have been no adverse comments  [**26] from any of the aforesaid State or Federal 
officials, the Court FINDS that compliance with CAFA is satisfactory.""). But see True v. Am. Honda Motor Co., 749 F. Supp. 2d 
1052, 1083 (C.D. Cal.2010) (determining that its authority to approve a settlement was ""questionable"" when the defendant gave 
CAFA notice only ten days prior to the final settlement approval hearing).
284 F.R.D. 249, *258; 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98301, **24

 
Id. The ""[f]actual determinations necessary to make Rule 23 findings must be made by a preponderance of the 
evidence. In other words, to certify a class the district court must find that the evidence more likely than not 
establishes each fact necessary to meet the requirements of Rule 23."" In re Ins. Brokerage Antitrust Litig., 579 F.3d 
241, 257-58 (3d Cir. 2009) (quoting In re Hydrogen Peroxide Antitrust Litig., 552 F.3d 305, 320 (3d Cir. 2008)). ""The 
decision of whether to approve a proposed settlement of a class action is left to the sound discretion of the district 
court."" In re Prudential Ins. Co. Am. Sales Practice Litig. Agent Actions, 148 F.3d 283, 299 (3d Cir. 1998) (quoting 
Girsh v. Jepson, 521 F.2d 153, 156 (3d Cir. 1975)).
A.  [**29] Class Certification
Where, as here, the Court has not already certified a class prior to evaluating a settlement, the Court initially must 
determine whether the proposed settlement classes satisfy the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 
23(a) and (b). See Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 619, 117 S. Ct. 2231, 138 L. Ed. 2d 689 (1997); 
see also In re Pet Food Prods. Liab. Litig., 629 F.3d 333, 341 (3d Cir. 2010) (""[A] district court first must determine 
that the requirements for class certification under Rule 23(a) and (b) are met.""). The Third Circuit Court of Appeals 
recently summarized the demands of Rule 23 as follows:
Rule 23(a) contains four threshold requirements, which every putative class must satisfy:
(1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable; (2) there are questions of law or 
fact common to the class; (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims 
or defenses of the class; and (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of 
the class.
Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a); see also Amchem, 521 U.S. at 613. Upon finding each of these prerequisites satisfied, a 
district court must then determine that the  [**30] proposed class fits within one of the categories of class 
actions enumerated in Rule 23(b).
As mentioned, Rule 23(b)(2) authorizes class actions seeking injunctive relief in instances where the defendant 
""has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief . . . is 
appropriate respecting the class as a whole."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2); see In re Comm. Bank of N. Va. (Comm. 
Bank I), 418 F.3d 277, 302 n.14 (2005). Separately, certification pursuant to Rule 23(b)(3) seeking monetary 
compensation is permitted where (1) ""questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over 
any questions affecting only individual members,"" and (2) ""a class action is superior to other available methods 
for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3); see Collins v. E.I. DuPont de 
Nemours & Co., 34 F.3d 172, 180 (3d Cir. 1994). These twin  [*260] requirements are commonly referred to as 
predominance and superiority.
Sullivan v. DB Invs., Inc., 667 F.3d 273, 296 (3d Cir. 2011) (en banc).
1. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a)
First, under Rule 23(a), the Court determines that the Class Members are ascertainable from  [**31] objective 
criteria, such as various electronic data files that contained names and addresses of customers that purchased 
shell eggs or egg products produced from caged birds in the United States, which were provided by 17 named egg 
producer Defendants, and that the Class Members thus ascertained are so numerous that their joinder before the 
Court would be impracticable. Plaintiffs ""need not precisely enumerate the potential size of the proposed class, nor 
[are] plaintiff[s] required to demonstrate that joinder would be impossible."" Cannon v. Cherry Hill Toyota, Inc., 184 
F.R.D. 540, 543 (D.N.J. 1999) (citation omitted); see also 7A Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal 
Practice and Procedure § 1762 (3d ed. 2005) (""'[I]mpracticable' does not mean 'impossible.' The representatives 
only need to show that it is extremely difficult or inconvenient to join all the members of the class.""); 1 A. Conte & H. 
Newberg, Class Actions § 3:14 (5th ed. 2011) (""Plaintiffs bear the burden of demonstrating that joinder is 
284 F.R.D. 249, *259; 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98301, **26

 
impracticable, but impracticable does not mean impossible.""). ""[G]enerally if the named plaintiff demonstrates that 
the potential number of plaintiffs exceeds 40, the first  [**32] prong of Rule 23(a) has been met."" Stewart v. 
Abraham, 275 F.3d 220, 226-27 (3d Cir. 2001) (citation omitted). Here, thousands of direct purchasers of shell eggs 
and egg products located across the United States were identified, based upon information provided by 17 named 
Defendants, as proposed members of the Settlement Class, and 905 Claim Forms were submitted to the Claims 
Administrator. This information certainly demonstrates that a class of this size makes individual joinder of all 
members impracticable and that the numerosity requirement is satisfied.
Second, the commonality requirement is satisfied insofar as Plaintiffs have alleged one or more questions of fact 
and law common throughout the Class. The commonality prerequisite does not require that all members of the 
prospective class share identical claims. Hassine v. Jeffes, 846 F.2d 169, 176-77 (3d Cir. 1988) (relying on 
Eisenberg v. Gagnon, 766 F.2d 770, 786 (3d Cir. 1985)). Rather, ""[t]he commonality requirement will be satisfied if 
the named plaintiffs share at least one question of fact or law with the grievances of the prospective class."" Baby 
Neal v. Casey, 43 F.3d 48, 56 (3d Cir. 1994). Also, class members can assert  [**33] such a single common 
complaint if they demonstrate that all class members are subject to the same harm. Id. 13
As is also further discussed in regards to the superiority requirement under Rule 23(b)(3), infra, the Plaintiffs' claims 
here are based upon Moark's alleged conduct during the period in question, which Plaintiffs contend constituted an 
agreement to and furtherance of an unlawful conspiracy to manipulate the supply and prices of domestic eggs and 
egg products in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. See generally Sept. 26, 2011 Mem., 821 F. Supp. 2d at 
713-15 (discussing the specific alleged conduct of Defendants generally in  [**34] furtherance of alleged 
conspiracy). Additionally, Plaintiffs allegedly were subjected to the same type of harm by directly purchasing eggs 
and egg products at artificially inflated prices due to the alleged conspiracy. Because the class members' claims 
arise from the same nucleus of operative facts and involve the same legal theories against Moark, the Court finds 
that the commonality prong under Rule 23(a)(2) is met.
Third, the Court finds that the claims of the named Plaintiffs—companies, corporations,  [*261] and businesses that 
purchased shell eggs, egg products, or both, from one or more of the Defendants—are typical of the claims of the 
Class Members and the respective Subclass members. ""If the claims of the named plaintiffs and putative class 
members involve the same conduct by the defendant, typicality is established regardless of factual differences."" 
Newton v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., 259 F.3d 154, 183-84 (3d Cir. 2001). The Third Circuit Court 
of Appeals has recognized that the ""jurisprudence 'assures that a claim framed as a violative practice can support a 
class action embracing a variety of injuries so long as those injuries can all be linked to the practice.'""  [**35] Id. at 
184 (quoting Baby Neal, 43 F.3d at 63). In this action, the claims of the class representatives are aligned with those 
of the Class Members, and members of the Subclasses, inasmuch as the claims of the representatives arise out of 
the same alleged misconduct of the Defendants and core facts and events. Further, the representative Plaintiffs' 
claims and the absent Class Members' claims rely on the same legal theories and arise from the same alleged 
""conspiracy"" and ""illegal agreement"" by Defendants. Moreover, named Plaintiffs, like all putative Class Members, 
allegedly have suffered the same injury—namely, economic damages arising from alleged artificially-inflated 
purchase prices—as a result of the Defendants' alleged anticompetitive conduct.
Fourth, the final prerequisite under Rule 23(a), the adequacy of the representative parties requirement, ""has two 
components: (1) concerning the experience and performance of class counsel; and (2) concerning the interests and 
incentives of the representative plaintiffs."" Dewey v. Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft, 681 F.3d 170, 182 (3d Cir. 
2012) (citing Comm. Bank I, 418 F.3d at 303). Essentially, the inquiry into the adequacy of the representative 
 [**36] parties examines whether ""the putative named plaintiff has the ability and the incentive to represent the 
13 The Supreme Court recently explained: ""What matters to class certification . . . is not the raising of common 'questions'—even 
in droves—but, rather the capacity of a classwide proceeding to generate common answers apt to drive the resolution of the 
litigation. Dissimilarities within the proposed class are what have the potential to impede the generation of common answers."" 
Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 131 S. Ct. 2541, 2551, 180 L. Ed. 2d 374 (2011) (quoting Richard A. Nagareda, Class 
Certification in the Age of Aggregate Proof, 84 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 97, 132 (2009))
284 F.R.D. 249, *260; 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98301, **31

 
claims of the class vigorously, that he or she has obtained adequate counsel, and that there is no conflict between 
the individual's claims and those asserted on behalf of the class."" Hassine, 846 F.2d 169 at 179 (citations omitted); 
see also Dewey, 681 F.3d at 182 (recognizing that ""the linchpin of the adequacy requirement is the alignment of 
interests and incentives between the representative plaintiffs and the rest of the class""). In other words, ""Rule 
23(a)(4) serves to uncover conflicts of interest between named parties and the class they seek to represent."" 
Amchem, 521 U.S. at 625. If any conflicts ""undercut the representative plaintiffs' ability to adequately represent the 
class"" they are ""fundamental,"" such that class representation is structurally faulty and Rule 23(a)(4) cannot be 
satisfied. Dewey, 681 F.3d at 184-85.
The Court determines that the representative Plaintiffs indeed will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the 
Settlement Class. Here, the interests of the representative Plaintiffs are consistent with those of the Class 
Members, and respective Subclass  [**37] members, and there appear to be no conflicts between or among these 
groups. As discussed, the representative Plaintiffs were damaged as a result of the Defendants' allegedly unlawful 
conduct, including Moark's alleged conduct, and the named Plaintiffs would have had to prove the same 
wrongdoing as the putative Class Members to establish the Defendants' (and Moark's) liability. Moreover, all 
representative Plaintiffs and Class Members have present claims (and no future claims) and have suffered 
economic damages. Furthermore, there is no apparent conflict among Class Members, or Subclasses, with respect 
to the allocations for distribution of the Settlement Amount because such allocations are based upon a pro rata 
share determined by purchases of shell eggs and egg products from any producer, including any Defendant, in the 
United States during the period designated in the Agreement. The representative and putative Class Members have 
a common interest in Moark's cooperation in assisting with the prosecution of the class claims against the non-
settling Defendants. It follows that the representative Plaintiffs' interests are directly aligned with those of other 
members of the Class and  [**38] Subclasses.
Additionally, the representative Plaintiffs have been, have the incentive, and appear to be capable of continuing to 
be active participants in both the prosecution and the settlement  [*262] of this suit against Moark, if the case had 
continued, and against the remaining Defendants. To assist them, Plaintiffs have retained attorneys who are highly 
qualified, experienced, and able to conduct this litigation. The Court analyzes the capabilities and performance of 
Interim Co-Lead Counsel under Rule 23(a)(4) based upon the factors set forth in Rule 23(g). See Sheinberg v. 
Sorensen, 606 F.3d 130, 132 (3d Cir. 2010) (""Although questions concerning the adequacy of class counsel were 
traditionally analyzed under the aegis of the adequate representation requirement of Rule 23(a)(4) of the Federal 
Rules of Civil Procedure, those questions have, since 2003, been governed by Rule 23(g)."" (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 
23(g), advisory comm. note (2003))).
Here, the Court concludes that Interim Co-Lead Counsel satisfies Rule 23(g). Rule 23(g) requires consideration of 
four factors: ""the work counsel has done in identifying or investigating potential claims in the action,"" ""counsel's 
experience in handling  [**39] class actions, other complex litigation, and ""the types of claims asserted in the 
action,"" ""counsel's knowledge of the applicable law,"" and ""the resources that counsel will commit to representing the 
class."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(g)(1)(A)(i)-(iv). The Court ""must also ensure that '[c]lass counsel [will] fairly and 
adequately represent the interests of the class.'"" Sheinberg, 606 F.3d at 132-33 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(g)(4)). 
14
Interim Co-Lead Counsel have extensive documented experience in complex class action litigation, including those 
based upon violations of antitrust law, and are well-respected law firms in the plaintiffs' class action bar who have 
demonstrated considerable dedication and ability thus far in this litigation. Interim Co-Lead Counsel have capably 
managed this suit on behalf of Plaintiffs since the Court formally appointed them to that role. Their work has 
 [**40] included the consolidation of the individual cases, negotiating the Moark and Sparboe Settlements, handling 
the motion to dismiss stage, and preparing for and commencing discovery. In sum, Interim Co-Lead Counsel's work 
14 The Court may also consider other possibly relevant information as to the adequacy of counsel, such as proposed terms for 
attorneys' fees and nontaxable costs and ""any other matter pertinent to counsel's ability to fairly and adequately represent the 
interests of the class."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(g)(1)(B), (C).
284 F.R.D. 249, *261; 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98301, **36

 
on behalf of the Plaintiffs has been extensive and involved the dedication of substantial resources and energy. 
Interim Co-Lead Counsel's work thus far in this suit and prior experience demonstrate that these attorneys have 
fairly and adequately represented the interests of the Moark Settlement Class, and Subclasses, and will continue to 
do so.
Accordingly, the Court finds that four threshold requirements of Rule 23(a) have been satisfied.
2. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)
Having determined that the requirements of Rule 23(a) are met, the Court next must consider whether the 
requirements of at least one subsection of Rule 23(b) are met. Here, Plaintiffs are seeking certification under Rule 
23(b)(3). See also Pls.' Mem. of Law on Prelim. Approval of Moark Settlement at 24 (Doc. No. 349). Rule 23(b)(3) 
permits class actions where ""the court finds that the questions of law or fact common to Class members 
predominate over any questions affecting only individual members,  [**41] and that a class action is superior to 
other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3). These 
requirements are commonly separated into the so-called ""predominance"" and ""superiority"" requirements. See Ins. 
Brokerage, 579 F.3d at 257-58.
a. Predominance
To evaluate the predominance requirement, a court must determine whether common questions of law or fact 
predominate over any questions affecting only individual members. See Hydrogen Peroxide, 552 F.3d at 311-12. 
""Rule 23(b)(3)'s predominance requirement imposes a more rigorous obligation [than Rule 23(a)(2)'s commonality 
element] upon a reviewing court to ensure that issues common to the class predominate over those affecting only 
individual class members. Sullivan, 667 F.3d at 297 (quoting  [*263] Ins. Broker., 579 F.3d at 266). As such, the 
Third Circuit Court of Appeals ""consider[s] the Rule 23(a) commonality requirement to be incorporated into the more 
stringent Rule 23(b)(3) predominance requirement, and therefore deem[s] it appropriate to 'analyze the two factors 
together, with particular focus on the predominance requirement.'"" Id. Third Circuit precedent ""provides that the 
focus  [**42] of the predominance inquiry is on whether the defendant's conduct was common as to all of the class 
members, and whether all of the class members were harmed by the defendant's conduct."" Id.
""Predominance is a test readily met in certain cases alleging . . . violations of the antitrust laws."" Amchem, 521 U.S. 
at 625. This is because these types of claims typically arise from an alleged common course of conduct on the part 
of the defendant, and depend upon common proof of liability, such as evidence of the defendants' conduct. See, 
e.g., In re Warfarin Sodium Antitrust Litig., 391 F.3d 516, 528 (3d Cir. 2004) (questions of fact and law are common 
to the class because the claims at issue and proof of liability depend upon the defendants' alleged conduct). 
Furthermore, that Plaintiffs have allegedly suffered ""purely an economic injury""—in contrast to a physical injury—
such overpayment for a product on account of the Defendants', and more specifically, Moark's, alleged 
anticompetitive conduct can ""further support[] a finding of commonality and predominance because there are little 
or no individual proof problems in this case otherwise commonly associated with physical injury claims."" Id.
Indeed,  [**43] this same rationale leads the Court to conclude here that the common issues of Class Members 
predominate over any individual issues as to their antitrust claim against Moark. The task at hand requires the Court 
to ""examine the elements of plaintiffs' claim through the prism of Rule 23."" Hydrogen Peroxide, 552 F.3d at 311 
(internal quotation marks omitted). Here, the Plaintiffs' claim arises under Section 1 of the Sherman Act. ""To 
establish a violation of Section 1, a plaintiff must prove: (1) concerted action by the defendants; (2) that produced 
anticompetitive effects within the relevant product and geographic markets; (3) that the concerted actions were 
illegal; and (4) that it was injured as a proximate result of the concerted action."" Gordon v. Lewistown Hosp., 423 
F.3d 184, 207 (3d Cir. 2005).
284 F.R.D. 249, *262; 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98301, **40

 
The reasoning in In re Insurance Brokerage Antitrust Litigation is applicable here. In Insurance Brokerage, our 
Court of Appeals concluded that ""[b]ecause each of the elements of a Sherman Act violation involves common 
questions of law and fact, . . . common questions predominate over individual ones with respect to the federal 
antitrust claim."" 579 F.3d at 269. The Court determined that  [**44] since ""the first and third elements of a Sherman 
Act violation focus on the conduct of the defendants, we find that common questions abound with respect to 
whether the defendants engaged in illegal, concerted action."" Id. at 268. This is true in this case, because the 
common questions relevant to these elements include, inter alia, whether Moark and the other Defendants agreed 
to the alleged conspiracy to manipulate the supply and prices of domestic eggs and egg products in violation of 
Section 1 of the Sherman Act, and whether the alleged conspirators' conduct amounted to an illegal restraint of 
trade. Furthermore, with respect to the second element of the Plaintiffs' Section 1 claim, there are at the very least 
the common questions relating to whether the alleged conspirators' actions reduced the supply of and increased 
prices for domestic eggs and egg products.
Also, like Insurance Brokerage, here, the fourth element of the Sherman Act claim ""focuses on whether the plaintiffs 
were injured by the defendants' conduct,"" and as a result ""it may still involve common questions of law and fact if 
proof of injury can be established on a class-wide basis."" Id. at 268. As the Court of Appeals  [**45] recognized, ""for 
purposes of class certification pursuant to Rule 23(b)(3), 'the task for plaintiffs . . . is to demonstrate that the 
element of antitrust impact is capable of proof at trial through evidence that is common to the class rather than 
individual to its members.'"" Id. (citing Hydrogen Peroxide, 552 F.3d at 311-12. The issue here is whether the Class 
Members were proximately injured by the conduct  [*264] of Moark and other Defendants, which is a question that 
is capable of proof common to the class members. Thus, even though the amount of damage that each plaintiff 
allegedly suffered could not necessarily be established by common proof, nonetheless, ""the element of antitrust 
injury-that is, the fact of damages-is susceptible to common proof."" Id. The reasoning in Insurance Brokerage 
applies here:
[W]e are not as concerned with ""formulat[ing] some prediction"" as to how this element of a Sherman Act 
violation would ""play out"" at trial, 552 F.3d at 311 (internal quotation marks omitted), ""for the proposal is that 
there be no trial,"" Amchem, 521 U.S. at 620, and instead our inquiry into the element of antitrust injury is solely 
for the purpose of ensuring that issues common to the class  [**46] predominate over individual ones. As the 
foregoing analysis demonstrates, common questions exist even with respect to the element of antitrust injury 
and therefore any individual issues do not overwhelm the common ones.
Id.
Furthermore, the Court does not find that the use of Subclasses of direct purchasers of eggs and direct purchasers 
of egg products alters any of the foregoing analysis because the claims with respect to each Subclass rely upon the 
same alleged conduct of Moark and other Defendants, common proof of such conduct, and economic harm of 
overpayment for the respective products resulting from such conduct. Accordingly, the Court concludes that the 
predominance requirement is satisfied here because each element of the Plaintiffs' federal antitrust violation 
involves common questions of law and fact, and these common questions predominate over individual issues.
b. Superiority
To meet the superiority requirement, Plaintiffs must show that a class action, rather than individual litigation or other 
available methods of adjudication, is the best method for achieving a fair and efficient adjudication of the 
controversy. See Newton, 259 F.3d at 191. Several factors are relevant to  [**47] the superiority inquiry: ""(A) the 
class members' interests in individually controlling the prosecution or defense of separate actions; (B) the extent 
and nature of any litigation concerning the controversy already begun by or against class members; (C) the 
desirability or undesirability of concentrating the litigation of the claims in the particular forum; and (D) the likely 
difficulties in managing a class action."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3). In effect, ""[t]he superiority requirement asks the 
court to balance, in terms of fairness and efficiency, the merits of a class action against those of alternative 
available methods of adjudication."" Prudential, 148 F.3d at 316 (internal quotations omitted).
284 F.R.D. 249, *263; 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98301, **43

 
The Court makes no determination at this time concerning the manageability of the Plaintiffs' suit as a class action if 
this action were to go to trial in a single forum or, to the extent this possibility remains, be remanded to the various 
transferor courts. ""Confronted with a request for settlement-only class certification, a district court need not inquire 
whether the case, if tried, would present intractable management problems, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3)(D), for the 
proposal is that there  [**48] be no trial."" Amchem, 521 U.S. at 620.
In considering the other relevant factors, the Court finds that the Class, and Subclasses, satisfy the superiority 
requirements of Rule 23(b)(3). Here, there is a potentially large number of class members—perhaps numbering 
over 13,000—who as a whole are geographically widely disbursed. See Pls.' Mem. of Law on Prelim. Approval of 
Moark Settlement at 14. These factors represent a potentially crushing strain on and inefficient application of judicial 
resources if the putative class members' claims were prosecuted individually. Furthermore, when ""each consumer 
has a very small claim in relation to the cost of prosecuting a lawsuit. . . , a class action facilitates spreading of the 
litigation costs among the numerous injured parties and encourages private enforcement of the statutes."" Warfarin, 
391 F.3d at 534. Under the present circumstances, a class action device enables individual direct purchasers to 
pursue their claims in an economically feasible manner, with greater efficacy  [*265] in achieving enforcement and 
deterrence goals, and with greater bargaining power for settlement purposes. 15
Putative Class Members were free to opt out of the settlement to pursue their own claims individually if they so 
chose, and some of the direct purchasers who opted out of the Moark Settlement, namely, a subset of the Direct 
Action Plaintiffs, indeed have filed individual actions that name Moark as a defendant and that have been 
consolidated or coordinated in this multi-district litigation. Another case brought by opt out parties against Moark for 
its alleged conduct is pending in Kansas state court as a result of a ruling of this Court. See Dec. 19, 2011 Mem., 
2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 146258, 2011 WL 6396462, (Doc. No. 601). That there are only two pending Direct Action 
Plaintiff suits and one  [**51] state court suit pending against Moark based upon its alleged antitrust conduct 
suggests that few Class Members have significant individual claims, or interest in bringing their claims separately, 
and that there is a lack of interest in the individual prosecution of claims among Class Members on the whole. See 
id.
For these reasons, a class action resolution in the manner proposed in the Moark Settlement would be superior to 
other available methods for a fair and efficient adjudication of the case against Moark.
3. Conclusion as to Class Certification for Settlement Purposes
Because the Court concludes that all of the Rule 23(a) and (b)(3) requirements have been met, the Court certifies 
the Class, and Subclasses, as defined above for settlement purposes.
15 For these same reasons, to the extent that consideration of Rule 23(b)(3)(C)  [**49] is pertinent here, and, for now, without 
regard to the remand mechanisms for an MDL action, it would be preferable to adjudicate these claims in one judicial proceeding 
and in one forum as a class action. See Amalgamated Workers Union of Virgin Islands v. Hess Oil Virgin Islands Corp., 478 F.2d 
540, 543, 10 V.I. 575 (3d Cir. 1973) (""The 'superiority requirement' was intended to refer to the preferability of adjudicating 
claims of multiple-parties in one judicial proceeding and in one forum, rather than forcing each plaintiff to proceed by separate 
suit, and possibly requiring a defendant to answer suits growing out of one incident in geographically separated courts.""). See 
generally Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) 1966 note (""Also pertinent is the question of the desirability of concentrating the trial of the 
claims in the particular forum by means of a class action, in contrast to allowing the claims to be litigated separately in forums to 
which they would ordinarily be brought.""). However, as one commentator has discussed, in light of 28 U.S.C. § 1407, as a 
general matter, ""[t]his factor should . . . be of little or no significance in resolving the superiority issue."" Newberg, supra, §4:31. 
Indeed,  [**50] this factor appears to have limited bearing under the present circumstances because the United States Judicial 
Panel on Multidistrict Litigation previously considered, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1407, the desirability of centralizing the various 
initially-filed direct purchaser class action suits in this particular forum, see In re Processed Egg Prods. Antitrust Litig., 588 F. 
Supp. 2d 1366, 1367 (J.P.M.L. 2008), and a consolidated class action complaint was filed which superseded all previously-filed 
direct purchaser complaints.
284 F.R.D. 249, *264; 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98301, **47

 
B. Notice
""In the class action context, the district court obtains personal jurisdiction over the absentee class members by 
providing proper notice of the impending class action and providing the absentees with the opportunity to be heard 
or the opportunity to exclude themselves from the class."" Prudential, 148 F.3d at 306. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 sets forth 
two provisions concerning notice to class members.
First, Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(2)(B)  [**52] requires that class members be given the best notice practicable under the 
circumstances, including individual notice to all potential class members identifiable through reasonable effort. This 
notice is to be given to all potential members of a Rule 23(b)(3) class. Prudential, 148 F.3d at 326. Specifically, the 
Rule provides that such notice
must, in clear, concise and plain language, state: (i) the nature of the action; (ii) the definition of the class 
certified; (iii) the class claims, issues or defenses; (iv) the class member's right to enter an appearance by an 
attorney; (v) the class member's right to be excluded from the class; (vi) the time and manner for requesting 
exclusion; and (vii) the binding effect of settlement on class members.
Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(2)(B).
Second, Rule 23(e) requires all members of the class be notified of the terms of any  [*266] proposed settlement. 
Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e). This ""notice is designed to summarize the litigation and the settlement"" and ""to apprise class 
members of the right and opportunity to inspect the complete settlement documents, papers, and pleadings filed in 
the litigation."" Prudential, 148 F.3d at 327 (quoting 2 Newberg, supra, § 8.32 at  [**53] 8-109).
Here, the Notice of the Moark Settlement contained the information required by Rules 23(c)(2) and 23(e). The 
Notice appropriately detailed the nature of the action, the Class claims, the definition of the Class and Subclasses, 
the terms of the proposed settlement agreement, and the class members' right to object or request exclusion from 
the settlement and the timing and manner for doing so. The Notice also informed Class Members of their 
opportunity to be heard at the fairness hearing and to enter an appearance through an attorney, and stated that the 
settlement would be binding on Class Members who did not opt out of it.
Furthermore, the extent of the Plaintiffs' efforts to notify potential Class Members is adequate. The Notice was 
mailed to potential Class Members individually based upon consumer information provided by Moark. See Larson v. 
AT&T Mobility LLC, No. 10-1285, 687 F.3d 109, 2012 U.S. App. LEXIS 13292, 2012 WL 2478376, at *9 (3d Cir. 
June 29, 2012) (recognizing that ""'individual notice to identifiable class members is not a discretionary consideration 
to be waived in a particular case. It is, rather, an unambiguous requirement of Rule 23. . . . Accordingly, each class 
member who can be identified through  [**54] reasonable effort must be notified. . . .'"" (quoting Eisen v. Carlisle & 
Jacquelin, 417 U.S. 156, 176, 94 S. Ct. 2140, 40 L. Ed. 2d 732 (1974))). In addition, the parties published a notice 
of the settlement on the same day in several appropriate publications, and distributed a press release concerning 
the Moark Settlement to approximately 1,000 journalists in the restaurant and food industries, which resulted in 
some 335 articles that reported on both the Moark and Sparboe Settlements. See Zimmer Paper Prods., Inc. v. 
Berger & Montague, P.C., 758 F.2d 86, 90 (3d Cir.1985) (""It is well settled that in the usual situation first-class mail 
and publication in the press fully satisfy the notice requirement of both Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 and the due process 
clause."").
Accordingly, the Court determines that the notice provided to the putative Class Members constitutes adequate 
notice in satisfaction of the demands of Rule 23.
C. Fair, Reasonable, and Adequate
To grant final approval, the Court must conclude that the proposed settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate. Ins. 
Brokerage, 579 F.3d at 258; Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(2). Trial courts generally are afforded broad discretion in

determining whether to approve a proposed class  [**55] action settlement. Eichenholtz v. Brennan, 52 F.3d 478, 
482 (3d Cir. 1995). 16
Although no opposition has been filed to the Motion and no objectors have contested the settlement, pursuant to 
Rule 23(e), the Court has the duty of protecting absentee class members, and the Court executes this duty by 
independently ""assuring the settlement represents adequate compensation for the release of the class claims."" 
Prudential, 148 F.3d at 316-317. 17 Indeed,  [*267] certain requirements of Rule 23 ""demand undiluted, even 
heightened, attention in the settlement context."" Amchem, 521 U.S. at 620. Cognizant of this duty, the Court 
evaluates the fairness, reasonableness, and adequacy of the Moark Settlement  [**56] as follows.
1. Initial Presumption of Fairness
Based upon the record, the Court concludes that an initial presumption of fairness attaches to the Settlement. The 
Third Circuit Court of Appeals has ""directed a district court to apply an initial presumption of fairness when 
reviewing a proposed settlement where: '(1) the settlement negotiations occurred at arm's length; (2) there was 
sufficient discovery; (3) the proponents of the settlement are experienced in similar litigation; and (4) only a small 
fraction of the class objected.'"" Warfarin, 391 F.3d at 535 (citing In re Cendant Corp. Litig., 264 F.3d 201, 232 n.18 
(3d Cir. 2001)).
These criteria have been met here. The proposed class settlement was negotiated at arm's length over the course 
of four months by the Plaintiffs' Interim Co-Lead Counsel and Moark's counsel. As further discussed, infra, although 
no formal discovery was conducted in this case during the time of the Moark Settlement negotiations or agreement, 
Plaintiffs' Interim Co-Lead Counsel conducted informal discovery, including, inter alia, independently 
 [**59] investigating the merits prior to filing the complaint (with additional investigation prior to filing amended 
16 The Third Circuit Court of Appeals recognizes that ""[g]reat weight is accorded [the] views [of the trial judge] because he is 
exposed to the litigants, and their strategies, positions and proofs. He is aware of the expense and possible legal bars to 
success. Simply stated, he is on the firing line and can evaluate the action accordingly."" Walsh v. Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea 
Co., Inc., 726 F.2d 956, 965 (3d Cir. 1983) (quoting Ace Heating & Plumbing Co. v. Crane Co., 453 F.2d 30, 34 (3d Cir. 1971)).
17 The Manual for Complex Litigation observes that the ""task is demanding because the adversariness of litigation is often lost 
after the agreement to settle."" David F. Herr, The Manual for Complex Litigation § 21.61, at 487 (4th ed. 2011). Indeed, the 
observation that ""'[c]ourts applying [a multifactor] test [ ] often recite the litany and engage in pro forma analyses, but their hearts 
are not in it,'"" could be an equally a propos statement for those parties advancing unopposed motions for final settlement 
approval. Ehrheart v. Verizon Wireless, 609 F.3d 590, 605 n.10 (3d Cir. 2010) (dissenting, Smith, J.) (quoting Jonathan R. 
Macey & Geoffrey P. Miller, Judicial Review of Class Action Settlements, 1 J. of Legal Analysis 167, 172 (2009)).
Here, there is an absence of any objectors or any adversarial challenge to the Motion at bar, which appears to account for the 
dearth of any arguments criticizing, exposing, or meaningfully addressing possible flaws or drawbacks to the settlement 
agreement appearing in the record. Nonetheless, the Court recognizes that although the final settlement approval process may 
have lacked an edgy or adversarial demeanor, this does not necessarily  [**57] bear on whether the settlement negotiation 
process was adversarial and resulted in a fair, reasonable, and adequate settlement. This is because the focus here is on the 
settlement agreement, and ""[w]hether or not there are objectors or opponents to the proposed settlement, the court must make 
an independent analysis of the settlement terms."" Herr, supra, at 488. Furthermore, the Court notes that, in response to the 
Court's inquiries for additional facts and development of the record, Interim Co-Lead Counsel fully and appropriately cooperated 
in the Court's efforts to consider and analyze the proposed settlement.
Nonetheless, in the event that any other partial or complete settlements are reached in the future of this case, or in this multi-
district litigation generally, all parties' counsel are well-advised to, again, continue to be responsive and attentive to the Court's 
inquiries as to settlement agreements during the various approval processes, and also to anticipate and be cognizant of what 
appropriate, specific information the Court needs—particularly in light of recent case law developments—in order to perform the 
fact intensive inquiry required for executing its duty to protect  [**58] absentee class members. After all, the burden lies with the 
movants to demonstrate that the settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate.
284 F.R.D. 249, *266; 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98301, **54

 
complaints) and exercising opportunities to review records provided by Sparboe, all of which enabled counsel to 
have sufficient background in the facts of the case, including Moark's alleged role in it. As previously discussed, 
Interim Co-Lead Counsel are extremely experienced in class action litigation, and specifically, similar antitrust 
litigation. Furthermore, no member of the purported class objected to the settlement.
Given that the Court finds that the four factors are sufficiently met, the presumption of fairness applies to the 
settlement.
2. Standards for Determining Fairness of Proposed Settlement
The Third Circuit Court of Appeals has set forth nine factors, known as the Girsh factors, to be considered when 
determining the fairness of a proposed settlement:
(1) the complexity, expense and likely duration of the litigation; (2) the reaction of the class to the settlement; 
(3) the stage of the proceedings and the amount of discovery completed; (4) the risks of establishing liability; 
(5) the risks of establishing damages; (6) the risks of maintaining the class action through  [**60] trial; (7) the 
ability of the defendants to withstand a greater judgment; (8) the range of reasonableness of the settlement 
fund in light of the best possible recovery; (9) the range of reasonableness of the settlement fund to a possible 
recovery in light of all the attendant risks of litigation . . .
Girsh, 521 F.2d at 157 (internal quotations and punctuation marks omitted); Prudential, 148 F.3d at 317. ""The 
settling parties bear  [*268] the burden of providing that the Girsh factors weigh in favour of approval of the 
settlement."" Pet Food, 629 F.3d at 350 (citing In re General Motors Corp. Pick-Up Truck Fuel Tank Prods. Liab. 
Litig., 55 F.3d 768, 785 (3d Cir. 1995)).
In In re Prudential Insurance Company of America Sales Practice Litigation Agent Actions, the Third Circuit Court of 
Appeals also identified additional non-exclusive factors for courts to consider for a ""thoroughgoing analysis of 
settlement terms."" See Pet Food, 629 F.3d at 350. Those factors, known as the Prudential factors, include:
[T]he maturity of the underlying substantive issues, as measured by experience in adjudicating individual 
actions, the development of scientific knowledge, the extent of discovery on the merits, and  [**61] other factors 
that bear on the ability to assess the probable outcome of a trial on the merits of liability and individual 
damages; the existence and probable outcome of claims by other classes and subclasses; the comparison 
between the results achieved by the settlement for individual class or subclass members and the results 
achieved—or likely to be achieved—for other claimants; whether class or subclass members are accorded the 
right to opt out of the settlement; whether any provision for attorneys' fees are reasonable; and whether the 
procedure for processing individual claims under the settlement is fair and reasonable.
See Prudential, 148 F.3d at 323. 18 While the Court must make findings as to the Girsh factors to approve a 
settlement as fair, reasonable, and adequate, the Prudential factors are illustrative of additional factors that may be 
useful even though they are not essential or inexorable depending upon the specific circumstances.
Although there is an overriding public interest in settling class actions,  [**62] district courts should apply ""an even 
more rigorous, heightened standard in cases where settlement negotiations precede class certification, and 
approval for settlement and class certification are sought simultaneously."" Pet Food, 629 F.3d at 350 (internal 
quotations omitted). ""This heightened standard is designed to ensure that class counsel has demonstrated 
'sustained advocacy' throughout the course of the proceedings and has protected the interests of all class 
members."" Prudential, 148 F.3d at 317.
18 The Court of Appeals invites individualized analysis by noting that ""[o]ther related factors . . . also may be relevant to this 
inquiry."" Prudential, 148 F. 3d at 323 n.73.
284 F.R.D. 249, *267; 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98301, **58

 
Thus, the Court is required to make an independent analysis of the settlement to determine whether it is fair, 
reasonable, and adequate by independently evaluating all of the Girsh factors (and the Prudential factors, as 
appropriate), recognizing that the Court cannot substitute the parties' assurances or conclusory statements for its 
independent analysis of the settlement terms. Pet Food, 629 F.3d at 351. Accordingly, the Court ""may find it 
necessary to drill down into the case and into the agreement to make an independent 'scrupulous' analysis of the 
settlement terms"" and affirmatively seek out information to the extent that the parties have either not supplied it or 
have provided only  [**63] conclusory statements. See id.
3. Discussion of Girsh and Prudential Factors
The Court's analysis of the Girsh factors, and the Prudential factors, as appropriate, leads to the conclusion that the 
relevant considerations weigh in favor of a finding of fairness under Rule 23(e).
a. The Complexity, Expense and Likely Duration of the Litigation
The first Girsh factor, which evaluates the complexity, expenses and likely duration of the litigation, ""captures the 
probable costs, in both time and money, of continued litigation."" Warfarin, 391 F.3d at 536 (citation omitted). At the 
outset, the Court appreciates that antitrust suits, like this one, are often complex actions to prosecute. See In re 
Linerboard Antitrust Litig.,, 292 F. Supp. 2d 631, 639 (E.D. Pa. 2003). Furthermore, given that the settlement 
agreement occurred at an early stage of this litigation, prior to the active commencement of discovery, Plaintiffs 
have avoided such expense and  [*269] delay as may have attached to these settling Defendants. See Bell Atl. 
Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 558-59, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007) (recognizing that ""antitrust 
discovery can be expensive""). Discovery in this case against Moark would entail—which would demand reasonably 
 [**64] the same and similar discovery that will occur as to the remaining Defendants in this suit—considerable 
expenditures of financial resources and hours of attorney time relating to discovery for liability and damages, 
including extensive electronic discovery and scores of witness depositions, experts, class certification, further pre-
trial motions, and potentially a trial on the merits. The Court determines that such an undertaking ""would not only 
further prolong the litigation but also reduce the value of any recovery to the class."" Warfarin, 391 F.3d at 536. 
Accordingly, this factor weighs in favor of the Moark Settlement.
b. The Reaction of the Class to the Settlement
""In an effort to measure the class's own reaction to the settlement's terms directly, courts look to the number and 
vociferousness of the objectors."" Gen. Motors, 55 F.3d at 812. Considering this factor from a somewhat different 
angle, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals has recognized the practical conclusion that it is generally appropriate to 
assume that ""silence constitutes tacit consent to the agreement"" in the class settlement context. See Bell Atl. Corp. 
v. Bolger, 2 F.3d 1304, 1313 n.15 (3d Cir. 1993). By using  [**65] these considerations as a gauge of class reaction 
to the Moark Settlement, the Court determines that the class reaction here favors settlement. Indeed, there were no 
objections filed to the Settlement and thus no negative feedback to the settlement. Moreover, as Interim Co-Lead 
Counsel has represented, many of the Class Members are sophisticated entities with their own in-house counsel, 
and ostensibly have the resources and ability to assess the settlement agreement beyond the average layperson or 
enterprise.
Moreover, there were only 150 requests for exclusion from the Class, which is 1.14% of the Notice addressees, or 
virtually di minimis in light of the over 13,200 Notices of settlement that were sent (as well as published notices and 
press releases about the settlement). Additionally, 150 opt-outs is low in comparison to the 905 Claims Forms that 
284 F.R.D. 249, *268; 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98301, **62

 
were returned. 19 Furthermore, as Interim Co-Lead Counsel discussed at the final fairness hearing, many of the 150 
requests for exclusion come from entities or subsidiaries organizationally related to other opt-out filers, and so ""the 
approximate number of individual parties that have excluded [themselves from the settlement] resembles 
 [**66] more like approximately 74 [parties] as opposed to 150."" Final Hr'g Tr. at 12:2-12:4. 20 As such, this factor 
weighs in favor of the proposed settlement's fairness and adequacy. See Cendant Corp., 264 F.3d at 234-35 
(recognizing that low number of objectors and opt-outs strongly favors settlement and that ""[t]he vast disparity 
between the number of potential class members who received notice of the Settlement and the number of objectors 
creates a strong presumption that this factor weighs in favor of the Settlement"").
 [*270]  c. The Stage of the Proceedings and the Amount of Discovery Completed
This Girsh factor requires the Court to evaluate whether Plaintiffs have an ""adequate appreciation of the merits of 
the case before negotiating"" settlement. Prudential, 148 F.3d at 319 (quoting Gen. Motors, 55 F.3d at 813). ""To 
ensure that a proposed settlement is the product of informed negotiations, there should be an inquiry into the type 
and amount of discovery the parties have undertaken."" Id. The Third Circuit Court of Appeals has recognized that, 
even if a settlement occurs in an early stage of litigation, there are means for class counsel  [**68] to apprise 
themselves of the merits of the litigation, such as ""conduct[ing] significant independent discovery or investigations 
to develop the merits of their case (as opposed to supporting the value of the settlement)"" or retaining their own 
experts or interviewing witnesses. See Gen. Motors, 55 F.3d at 814.
Here, the Court is satisfied that Interim Co-Lead Counsel had adequate knowledge of the litigation and informed 
negotiations. 21 First, Interim Co-Lead Counsel has represented to the Court that they ""conducted extensive 
investigations into the case in preparation for filing of the complaint."" Sparboe Final Approval Mot. at 17-18; see 
also Hausfeld Decl. ¶ 5 (""Plaintiffs entered the negotiations with Sparboe with a significant amount of knowledge of 
Defendants' antitrust conspiracy, as a result of months of investigations into the conspiracy conducted by the 
numerous experienced law firms representing them.""); Asher Decl. ¶ 6 (recounting that the counsel's investigations 
included research into the egg industry, egg trade associations, such as United Egg Producers (""UEP""), UEP's 
animal welfare programs, the economics underlying the alleged conspiracy, and the legal issues relating  [**69] to 
the conspiracy). 22
19 Although the response rate to the Notice of Settlement (as measured by the number of Claim Forms returned in relation to 
number of Notices distributed) is low, the Court does not draw any inferences of negative class reaction to the settlement from 
this response rate. Cf. Zimmer Paper Products, Inc. v. Berger & Montague, P.C., 758 F.2d 86, 92-93 (3d Cir. 1985) (recognizing 
that an ostensibly low response rate may not in fact be low in light of other similar settlements). As previously discussed, the 
Court has determined that Class Members had adequate notice and opportunity to submit claims, opt out, or file objections. 
Furthermore, by comparison there were an additional  [**67] 222 Class Members who only requested exclusion from the 
Sparboe Settlement. See Keogh Aff. ¶ 17.
20 Interim Co-Lead Counsel has represented that several of the parties that opted out of the settlement, and that have now filed 
suits as Direct Action Plaintiffs, were in contact with counsel prior to the filing of this class action suit and so ""Plaintiffs and [those 
parties"" knew exactly what [the suit] was about. So . . . everyone was well familiar with what the settlement was, what the terms 
of settlement were, and what the litigation was about."" See Final Hr'g Tr. at 42:19-43:2.
21 As to this Girsh factor, the Plaintiffs' Motion argues that this factor weighs in favor of final approval because of ""the cooperation 
that will be provided by Moark as a result of this Settlement."" Mot. at 17. Because this factor requires assessment of the 
adequacy of counsel's knowledge and appreciation for the merits before settlement negotiations to ensure those negotiations 
are informed, the Court does not find this particular post hoc argument dispositive of whether Interim Co-Lead Counsel was 
adequately informed entering into and during settlement negotiations.
22 The Court recognizes that once experienced litigators, such as Interim Co-Lead Counsel, have acquired certain knowledge or 
insights about the litigation, such information will continue to inform Counsel's understanding of the case and appreciation of the 
merits. Accordingly, the Court determines it is appropriate to cross-reference here its observations and findings made in its 
284 F.R.D. 249, *269; 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98301, **65

 
Second, although virtually all formal discovery was stayed in this case  [**70] until after the execution of the 
Sparboe and Moark Agreements, Interim Co-Lead Counsel pursued informal discovery prior to negotiating 
settlement with Sparboe which enabled counsel to obtain the information that Plaintiffs needed concerning the 
merits of the case. See Prudential, 148 F.3d at 319 (recognizing that informal discovery methods can support 
adequate appreciation of the merits). Indeed, Interim Co-Lead Counsel has attested that they benefited from 
information exchanged during negotiations preceding the Sparboe settlement ""including the production of hundreds 
of pages of highly pertinent documents, prior to entering the Settlement Agreement"" and an interview with a 
Sparboe employee. See Sparboe Final Approval Mot. at 18; Hausfeld Decl. ¶¶ 7, 10, 12, 13. The information 
disclosed in that process pertained to the egg industry and specific conduct of the remaining Defendants. Asher 
Decl. ¶ 11. Interim Co-Lead Counsel represented that the documents Sparboe produced preceding and during the 
course of settlement negotiations, ""support Plaintiffs' allegations that there was a conspiracy to reduce egg supply 
through various means."" Hausfeld Decl. ¶ 14.
Indeed, Plaintiffs apparently  [**71] used the information acquired from the Sparboe negotiations in drafting their 
Second Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint. See Sparboe Final Approval Mot. at 2 (""As a result of 
Sparboe's significant cooperation, Plaintiffs were able to file the now-operative Complaint, unprecedented in size 
and detail, explaining, in over 500 paragraphs and 140  [*271] pages, the intricate workings of Defendants' 
conspiracy, as well as the statements made, meetings held and actions taken in furtherance thereof.""). According to 
Plaintiffs, ""Moark produced transactional data and over 3,200 other documents to [Plaintiffs]. Those materials 
contained general descriptions of times, places and corporate participants relating to the conspiracy, as well as 
details regarding [United Egg Producer]'s participation in the conspiracy for the entire length of the class period."" 
Final Hr'g Tr. at 15:13-15:18. 23
Third, prior to the commencement of the Moark Settlement negotiations, Moark, LLC and Norco Ranch, Inc. had 
answered the Second Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint and set forth their affirmative defenses. Land 
O'Lakes, Inc. had moved for a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal. These pleadings and motion provided Interim Co-Lead 
Counsel with an additional platform from which to ascertain Moark's positions on the case and thereby to evaluate 
the merits of the litigation.
Based upon  [**73] the foregoing, the Court is satisfied that Interim Co-Lead Counsel, as highly experienced 
antitrust litigators, were in such a position prior to negotiating and entering into the Moark Settlement that they had 
an adequate understanding and appreciation of the strengths and weaknesses of the Plaintiffs' case. Accordingly, 
the Court determines this factor weighs in favor of settlement.
d. Risks of Establishing Liability, Damages, and Maintaining the Class Action Through Trial
These three Girsh factors concern the risks of establishing liability, damages, and maintaining a class action 
through trial. The factors require the Court to ""survey the potential risks and rewards of proceeding to litigation in 
order to weigh the likelihood of success against the benefits of an immediate settlement."" Warfarin, 391 F.3d at 
537. The inquiry requires balancing ""the likelihood of success and the potential damage award if the case were 
separate Memorandum concerning final approval of the Sparboe Settlement as it is relevant to the Court's independent 
assessment of this Girsh factor.
23 Additionally, Moark ""provided sales data and other financial information"" in advance of settlement negotiations ""that permitted 
Plaintiffs to accurately estimate the range of damages that could be proven at trial."" Bernstein Decl. ¶ 9. This particular 
information exchange appears primarily to have assisted  [**72] Interim Co-Lead Counsel in supporting the value of the 
settlement. See, e.g., id. ¶ 16 (framing the settlement amount in terms of Moark egg sales, net profits, and availability of ""reliable 
data""); Mot. at 11-12 (""The Settlement Agreement was only entered into after careful review of Moark's sales figures, net profits 
and market share during the damages period, and balanced them against the likely expense of litigating claims against Moark 
through trial.""). However, this does not appear to be the only result of the information exchange because such information also 
would have furthered counsel's appreciation for the merits of the case as well as establishing damages and identification of 
potential class members.
284 F.R.D. 249, *270; 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98301, **67

 
taken to trial against the benefits of immediate settlement."" Prudential, 148 F.3d at 319. For example, the Court 
assesses the risks of establishing liability to ""examine what the potential rewards (or downside) of litigation might 
have been had class counsel decided to  [**74] litigate the claims rather than settle them."" Gen. Motors, 55 F.3d at 
814. As another example, the inquiry into establishing damages ""attempts to measure the expected value of 
litigating the action rather than settling it at the current time."" Id. at 816.
In cases of settlements with only a subset of defendants to the suit, as is the case here:
[g]iven that the litigation might continue against other defendants, the parties may be reluctant to disclose fully 
and candidly their assessment of the proposed settlement's strengths and weaknesses that led them to settle 
separately. The adequacy of the settlement depends in part on the relative exposure and resources of other 
parties. An informed evaluation is extremely difficult if discovery is incomplete or has been conducted against 
only a few of the defendants.
Herr, supra, § 21.651, at 505. Thus, the Court understands why Plaintiffs decline to provide a detailed assessment 
of any risks perceived in establishing liability and damages, and instead emphasize that the Court should consider 
Interim Co-Lead Counsel's estimation of the probability of success in assessing these factors. See Mot. at 18-19 & 
n.8. Indeed, the Court gives credence  [**75] to  [*272] counsel's representation that although ""they believe 
[Plaintiffs] will prevail at trial, they recognize that antitrust cases, like all complex litigation against large companies 
with highly talented defense counsel, have inherent risks."" Id. at 18-19. The record demonstrates that counsel have 
significant experience in antitrust cases such as this one which ought to enable them to appreciate the strengths 
and weakness of the case and the risks of maintaining the action through trial.
Furthermore, antitrust class action litigation is complex, and, especially at its early stages, inherently rife with risk 
and unpredictability in terms of ultimately prevailing to establish liability and damages and achieve class 
certification. The Court finds that this suit presents no exception. The bulk of discovery, dispositive motion practice, 
expert discovery, class certification, and trial are on the horizon of this case with the attendant expense and 
uncertainties. Thus, there is a genuine risk of not prevailing in establishing class certification, liability, or damages. 
As all experienced litigators and jurists know, that a jury will be the ultimate fact-finder at trial presents further risks 
 [**76] and uncertainties.
The motion practice that has already transpired is indicative of the future risk that Plaintiffs face in prosecuting their 
case against Moark. The parties have already engaged in extensive motion practice concerning the Second 
Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint, which initially included Land O'Lakes, Inc.'s individual motion to 
dismiss before it was withdrawn subject to final approval of the Moark Settlement. The Plaintiffs' pending motion for 
leave to file a Third Consolidated Amended Class Action has been challenged in part by one group of defendants 
as to the claims against them individually.
Based on the detailed allegations in the Second Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint, Plaintiffs appear 
to have evidence to support their theory that Defendants conspired to reduce the supply of eggs and egg products, 
and thereby increase prices. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(b) (concerning representations to the Court in pleadings). 
Nonetheless, even assuming Plaintiffs could establish their theory of an overarching conspiracy at trial, their 
success in establishing liability and damages as to individual defendants, such as Moark, is by no means assured.
Through the  [**77] Sparboe Settlement, Plaintiffs may have secured cooperation in prosecuting their case, which, 
according to Interim Co-Lead Counsel, ""significantly reduces the risks associated with discovery."" See Sparboe 
Final Approval Mot. at 20. Nonetheless, such cooperation is no guarantee to success in proving liability and 
damages in this complex litigation, and Plaintiffs still must show that Defendants individually agreed to join the 
alleged conspiracy. Indeed, the other Defendants' individual motions to dismiss raised issues concerning whether 
they individually actually joined the conspiracy. Furthermore, Defendants jointly challenged at the motion to dismiss 
stage whether Plaintiffs could recover damages outside the statute of limitations. These issues remain live subjects 
for discovery and additional dispositive motion practice, and any trial on these issues would be protracted and 
involve a significant amount of testimony and documentary evidence, particularly given the time period at issue, 
which spans almost a decade, and the number of parties involved.
284 F.R.D. 249, *271; 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98301, **72

 
In  [**78] addition to challenging the Plaintiffs' complaints, Defendants also have demonstrated an intent to 
vigorously defend against this suit—including by raising privilege issues relating to the Sparboe Settlement, see, 
e.g., Order (Doc. No. 361); Order (Doc. No. 403), and other discovery-related issues, see, e.g., Conf. Tr. (Doc. No. 
591); Conf. Tr. (Doc. No. 675); Case Mgmt Order Nos. 16 to 19 (Doc. Nos. 604, 626, 656, and 676). Furthermore, 
Defendants have indicated during the course of these proceedings, particularly during the development of a 
discovery plan, that they intend to advance defenses, such as an agricultural cooperative immunity defense under 
the Capper-Volstead Act and a defense involving standard-setting conduct, that will present difficult factual and 
legal issues for the parties, creating their own brand and quantity of uncertainty for the Plaintiffs' case. See, e.g., 
Case Mgmt Order No. 19. The parties also contemplate expert discovery on damages, which likely will result in 
competing expert opinions representing very  [*273] different damage estimates that will present further ambiguity 
as to resolution on damages as to each Defendant. See, e.g., Conf. Tr. (Doc. No. 675).
It  [**79] is entirely likely that Plaintiffs would face similar, if not identical, legal challenges and uncertainties in their 
claims again Moark. Moark's counsel has represented that Moark would otherwise vigorously defend itself against 
the Plaintiffs' claims, but for reaching a settlement agreement. Indeed, according to counsel, ""the Moark employees 
feel as though they have never done anything unlawful. They have never engaged in any price fixing. And [insofar 
that they may cooperate with Plaintiffs pursuant to the Moark Settlement] they will not come into any interview or 
deposition saying that they had ever done anything wrong."" Final Hr'g Tr. at 43:9-43:16.
Finally, Plaintiffs not only face the risk that they will not succeed in establishing liability and damages, but also the 
risks associated with certifying and maintain a class. See Warfarin, 391 F. 3d at 537. Indeed ""'the prospects for 
obtaining certification have a great impact on the range of recovery one can expect to reap from the [class] action.'"" 
Id. (quoting Gen. Motors, 55 F.3d at 817). ""The value of a class action depends largely on the certification of the 
class because, not only does the aggregation of the claims enlarge the  [**80] value of the suit, but often the 
combination of the individual cases also pools litigation resources and may facilitate proof on the merits."" Gen. 
Motors, 55 F.3d at 817. Thus, this Girsh ""factor measures the likelihood of obtaining and keeping a class 
certification if the action were to proceed to trial,"" recognizing that a ""district court retains the authority to decertify or 
modify a class at any time during the litigation if it proves to be unmanageable."" Id. (citing Prudential, 148 F.3d at 
321).
Many, if not all, Defendants no doubt will vigorously oppose class certification. As Interim Co-Lead Counsel has 
recognized, Moark, if it remained in this litigation, would join those defense efforts in this respect. See Mot. at 20 
(""Interim Counsel acknowledges that had Moark not settled, it would have joined the non-settling Defendants in 
contesting class certification.""). The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has recognized: ""There will always be a 
'risk' or possibility of decertification, and consequently the court can always claim this factor weighs in favor of 
settlement."" Prudential, 148 F.3d at 321. 24 Thus, there are inherent difficulties in bringing a class action to trial 
 [**81] that apply here.
Because Plaintiffs would face genuine risks and uncertainties in establishing liability and damages against Moark, 
and in obtaining and maintaining class certification, should the claims against Moark continue without settlement, 
these three factors weigh in favor of settlement.
e. The Ability of the Defendant to Withstand a Greater Judgment
This factor ""is concerned with whether the defendants could withstand a judgment for an amount significantly 
greater than the Settlement."" Cendant, 264 F.3d at 240. Thus, the Court must consider here whether Moark could 
withstand a judgment for an amount significantly greater than $25 million and the costs associated with the 
proposed cooperation.
24 Based on this observation, the Court of Appeals has questioned the significance of this factor in ""settlement-only"" class 
actions following the Supreme Court's decision in Amchem. See Prudential, 148 F.3d at 321.
284 F.R.D. 249, *272; 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98301, **77

 
The limited evidence in the record suggests that Moark would be able to withstand a greater judgment. Indeed, the 
""$25,000,000 Settlement Amount represents almost 1% of total Moark egg sales during the class period and almost 
28% of Moark's cumulative net profits in the egg division  [**82] for the last six years."" Bernstein Decl. ¶ 16. ""For the 
full time period in which reliable data was available (2002-2008), Moark's total shell egg sales to non-defendants 
from 2002-2008 were approximately $2,456,200,000. Moark's net profits from shell eggs and egg products were 
approximately $90,516,000."" Id. There is no evidence concerning the financial or other possible impacts a greater 
judgment amount would have on Moark. See, e.g.,  [*274] Cendant, 264 F.3d at 240-41 (discussing the possibility 
of bankruptcy for a settling defendant).
Furthermore, the Plaintiffs' arguments tacitly suggest that Moark could withstand a larger judgment. They argue that 
even if Moark could withstand a larger judgment, it is ""not an obstacle to approving the Settlement."" Mot. at 20.
Thus, the record suggests that Moark could pay substantially more than the consideration set forth in the 
Settlement terms. Accordingly, this factor does not weigh in favor of approval.
f. The Range of Reasonableness of the Settlement in Light of the Best Possible Recovery and the Attendant Risks 
of Litigation
""The last two Girsh factors ask whether the settlement is reasonable in light of the best possible recovery and the 
risks the  [**83] parties would face if the case went to trial."" Prudential, 148 F.3d at 322. In other words, the Court 
evaluates ""whether the settlement represents a good value for a weak case or a poor value for a strong case. The 
factors test two sides of the same coin: reasonableness in light of the best possible recovery and reasonableness in 
light of the risks the parties would face if the case went to trial."" Warfarin, 391 F.3d at 538 (citing Prudential, 148 
F.3d at 322).
Here, the Court evaluates the settlement in light of its monetary and nonmonetary consideration. Ordinarily, ""[i]n 
order to assess the reasonableness of a proposed settlement seeking monetary relief, 'the present value of the 
damages plaintiffs would likely recover if successful, appropriately discounted for the risk of not prevailing, should 
be compared with the amount of the proposed settlement.'"" Prudential, 148 F.3d at 322. (citing Gen. Motors, 55 
F.3d at 806). 25 ""Settlements involving nonmonetary provisions for class members . . . deserve careful scrutiny to 
ensure that these provisions have actual value to the class,"" which can be accomplished through a Rule 23(e) 
analysis. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(h) advisory committee note  [**84] (2003). ""Despite the difficulties they pose to 
measurement, nonpecuniary benefits . . . may support a settlement."" Bolger, 2 F.3d at 1311.
As this settlement is structured to provide both monetary and nonmonetary consideration, it is difficult to determine 
accurately the actual total value of the proposed settlement. The traditional calculus for ascertaining the value of 
monetary settlements under Third Circuit law is inappropriate under these circumstances because it would not 
entirely capture the value of the relief afforded by this settlement. Cf.  [**85] Prudential, 148 F.3d at 323 
(recognizing that ""both the structure of the settlement and the uncapped nature of the relief provided make it difficult 
to determine accurately the actual value of the settlement"" and as such, ""the traditional calculus suggested by the 
Manual for Complex Litigation 2d and adopted by this Court in G.M. Trucks [Gen. Motors] cannot be applied to this 
case""). 26
The Court determines that the $25 million monetary relief in conjunction with the additional, valuable consideration 
of Moark's agreement to cooperate with Plaintiffs is reasonable both in light of the best possible recovery against 
25 The Third Circuit Court of Appeals expects that ""settling parties . . . should . . . provide[] information to determine the range of 
reasonableness of the [settlement] allocation 'in light of the best possible recovery,' and 'in light of all the attendant risks of 
litigation.'"" Pet Food, 629 F.3d at 354 (citations omitted). The Court further explains that ""'[t]his figure should generate a range of 
reasonableness (based on size of the proposed award and the uncertainty inherent in these estimates) within which a district 
court approving (or rejecting) a settlement will not be set aside.' Precise value determinations are not required.'"" Id.
26 Plaintiffs have not proffered any evidence for the record concerning such a present value analysis.
284 F.R.D. 249, *273; 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98301, **81

 
Moark and in light of the risks the parties would face if the case went to trial against Moark. Certainly, calculating 
the best possible recovery against Moark for the class in the aggregate is ""exceedingly speculative""  [**86] at this 
point in time given the previously-discussed risks of establishing liability and damages associated with this complex 
litigation, even when considering that  [*275] treble damages are technically available for recovery under the 
Plaintiffs' Sherman Act claim.
At the same time, the Court recognizes that Moark's agreement to cooperate with Plaintiffs throughout the course of 
pre-trial proceedings and trial is valuable consideration in light of the risks in proceeding with this suit against the 
remaining Defendants. 27 Interim Co-Lead Counsel has attested that ""[o]ne such benefit [of Moark's cooperation] is 
information regarding the conspiracy and Defendant UEP's participation in it for the length of the Class Period"" and 
the provision of ""important information and witnesses that bolster Plaintiffs' claims against the non-settling 
Defendants will be made available to Plaintiffs without the time and expense involved in pursuing formal discovery."" 
Bernstein Decl. at ¶ 18. Indeed, Moark produced some 3,200 documents with transactional data to Plaintiffs 
already, as well as making available employees for Plaintiffs to interview. Id. Granted, it seems that much of this 
non-privileged information  [**87] would otherwise be available eventually through discovery as required under the 
federal rules, if Moark remained in this suit. Nonetheless, such cooperation reduces costs and time associated with 
formal discovery. Indeed, the Moark Settlement likely has short-circuited at least some of the expense and delay of 
future discovery by securing Moark's cooperation and removing the Moark forces from those who would contest or 
complicate Plaintiffs' discovery efforts. Additionally, Plaintiffs gain a clear tactical advantage in obtaining such 
information through non-traditional discovery mechanisms, including, by way of example, the advantage of having 
this information to formulate strategy in taking discovery from the remaining Defendants, specific tailoring the scope 
and focus of discovery, and so forth. Finally, Plaintiffs have represented to the Court that Moark has helped Interim 
Co-Lead Counsel in resolving privilege issues relating to the Sparboe Settlement. Final Hr'g Tr. at 15:19-16:3.
While the value of this  [**88] cooperation is certainly of tangible value, it is not entirely without compare. First, 
Sparboe, too, has agreed to cooperate with Plaintiffs—albeit the information that Sparboe purportedly can provide 
pertains to a shorter time period than Moark's information. Second, Moark's cooperation does not appear to assure 
that Plaintiffs will have conclusive evidence in support of their claims against the remaining Defendants. Moark's 
counsel represented concerning the nature of Moark's cooperation as follows: ""No one will come in and say there 
was this giant conspiracy and people conspired and were all sitting in a room conspiring. [B]ut they will say exactly 
what happened, when it happened and who did what. Whatever that means. It means whatever it is."" Final Hr'g Tr. 
at 43:9-43:16. Indeed, Moark is a named Defendant in other cases in this litigation for the Indirect Purchaser 
Plaintiffs and Direct Action Plaintiff Giant Eagle Inc., Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc., Roundy's Supermarkets, Inc., C&S 
Wholesale Grocers, Inc., and H.J. Heinz Company, L.P., and the Moark Settlement does not impact those plaintiffs' 
claims against which Moark must continue to defend.
Nonetheless, when considering these two  [**89] Girsh factors in light of the record in toto, the Court is persuaded 
that the $25 million settlement amount and Moark's cooperation confer real and substantial benefits upon the Class. 
The Court further concludes that the settlement is reasonable in light of the best possible recovery and the risks the 
parties would face if the case went to trial against Moark. These factors weigh in favor of approval of the settlement.
g. Prudential Factors
The relevant Prudential factors weigh in favor of approving the Moark Settlement, or, at worst, are neutral factors. 
First, the Court has already addressed the impact that the limited extent of discovery on the merits thus far has on 
this litigation and other factors that bear on the ability to assess the  [*276] probable outcome of a trial on the merits 
of liability and individual damages.
27 The Court does not comment on whether the information and facts that Moark may provide would be established, or even 
admissible, at trial, based upon counsel's representations.
284 F.R.D. 249, *274; 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98301, **85

 
Second, the settlement agreement allows putative class members the right to opt out of the settlement. Indeed, 
some parties exercised this right by filing requests for exclusion. Furthermore, the Notice Packet included both a 
Notice of the Moark Settlement and a Notice of the Sparboe Settlement, thereby simultaneously notified class 
members of the Sparboe Settlement and  [**90] enabling class members to assess the adequacy of the two 
settlements in conjunction with one another and as to the whole suit.
Third, the results achieved by the settlement for the Class and Subclasses are immediate, concrete, and realized 
without the costs and delays associated with extensive discovery and other later stages of litigation. Moark's 
cooperation pursuant to the settlement aids the Plaintiffs in prosecuting and resolving their claims against the other 
Defendants. Indeed, Interim Co-Lead Counsel describe the Moark Settlement (in conjunction with the Sparboe 
Settlement) as an ""icebreaker"" settlement, which is a term used to describe ""the first settlement in the litigation—
and [a settlement that] should increase the likelihood of future settlements."" Linerboard, 292 F. Supp. 2d at 643. By 
contrast, it is unclear, given the aforementioned risks and uncertainties, supra, whether Direct Action Plaintiffs who 
are individually prosecuting their claims apart from the Class, or other parties who opted-out of the Moark 
Settlement, will be successful in their claims against Moark and the other Defendants, and whether that result will 
be immeasurably better than the result for class  [**91] members under the settlement agreement and as to the 
entire suit. For the same reasons, it is unclear whether those opt-out parties might achieve better settlements than 
the class to resolve similar claims against Moark.
Fourth, the Moark Settlement only releases Class Members' claims against Moark for claims arising out of injuries 
or damages that occurred ""from the beginning of time to the date when notice of the Court's entry of an order 
preliminarily approving this Agreement is first published"" and that resulted from the conduct asserted in the 
Plaintiffs' suit. As such, future claims for injuries or damages against Moark arising outside this time period but 
resulting from the alleged conduct giving rise to the class claims are not barred. The Release does not apply to 
those parties who opted-out of the Moark Settlement, such as Direct Action Plaintiffs Giant Eagle Inc., Winn-Dixie 
Stores, Inc., Roundy's Supermarkets, Inc., C&S Wholesale Grocers, Inc., and H.J. Heinz Company, L.P.
Fifth, all segments of the class are being treated equally relative to the monetary relief under the Moark Settlement. 
The distribution of the Settlement Amount, after administrative costs and expenses  [**92] and counsel fees, is a 
pro rata share proportionate to the dollar amount of a class members' direct purchases of shell egg and egg 
products in the United States during the period designated in the Agreement. There is no differentiation among 
class members in terms of subclasses or class representatives.
The Moark Settlement sets forth a method for calculating the distribution for recovery by Class Members based 
upon pro rata allocations, which appears to conform with a common formula used in class actions:
[A] common formula in class actions for damages is to distribute the net settlement fund after payment of 
counsel fees and expenses, ratably among class claimants according to the amount of their recognized 
transactions during the relevant time period. A typical requirement is for recognized loss to be established by 
the filing of proofs of claim, or statements of intention to prove claims, based on a specified value of 
transactions involved. . . . [I]n antitrust class actions, a proof of claim form may be utilized in disseminating the 
settlement proceeds among class members.""
Newberg, supra, § 12.35. Although the record demonstrates that the distribution allocation will be based upon 
 [**93] pro rata shares after costs and expenses and that the amount of recovery ""will be less than the total amount 
you paid"" for the eggs and egg products, given that the recovery represents ""overcharge,"" Notice at 5, Plaintiffs 
have not submitted a formal plan of allocation with the settlement agreement concerning the procedure for 
processing individual claims under the settlement,  [*277] addressing administrative costs and fees for the 
settlement, and so forth. ""The plan of allocation is usually submitted with the settlement agreement for 
consideration at the settlement hearing, though it may be deferred until a later date with court approval."" Newberg, 
284 F.R.D. 249, *276; 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98301, **89

 
supra, § 12.35. Here, Plaintiffs have represented they intend to separately apply to the Court to approve a final plan 
of allocation following settlement approval. 28
Sixth, the Moark Settlement's provision for the possible award of attorneys' fees and costs from the Settlement 
Amount is a neutral factor at this time. The Court cannot ascertain based upon the Agreement, which merely 
provides that Plaintiffs may seek attorneys' fees, whether such unspecified fees and costs impact the fairness, 
reasonableness, and adequacy of the settlement. 29 As a general matter, that the parties have agreed the 
attorneys' fees and costs may be awarded from the Settlement Amount would not weigh against approving the 
settlement. Cf. Newberg, supra, § 12:3 (""The defendants in a class action settlement may properly agree to pay the 
plaintiffs' attorneys' fees and expenses . . . . Such an agreement may take the form of an agreement to pay 
reasonable fees, to be subsequently determined by the court . . . .""). The Settlement Agreement specifically 
provides that ""Class Counsel may seek an award of attorneys' fees and reasonable litigation expenses approved by 
the Court, to be paid out of the Settlement Amount after the Final Approval of the Agreement."" Moark Settlement ¶ 
35. The Notice of Settlement expands upon the agreement's language,  [**95] stating that ""Class Counsel will apply 
to the Court for an award from the Settlement Fund of attorneys' fees and for reimbursement of litigation costs and 
expenses incurred, including fees and costs expended while providing Notice to the Class and while administering 
the Settlement Fund (including the plan of allocation)."" Notice at 4. The Notice also stated that the application would 
be for an award ""in an amount not to exceed thirty percent of $25 million as well as the costs and expenses 
incurred."" Id. Because, here, the Moark Settlement Agreement provides that the attorneys' fees and expenses 
ultimately will be determined upon approval of the Court, which will require the assessment of the reasonableness 
of any such fees and expenses sought pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(h) (and Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(d)(2)), the Moark 
Settlement's provisions concerning attorneys' fees and expenses do not raise issues at this time that would weigh 
against approving the settlement.
h. Summary of Girsh and Prudential Factors
Upon considering the Moark Settlement Agreement in light of all of the Girsh and the relevant Prudential factors, the 
Court is satisfied that the settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate. As discussed, a few of the factors are 
neutral or weigh against settlement approval. However, all of the factors considered in determining the fairness of a 
settlement ""are a guide; an unfavorable conclusion regarding one or more factors does not automatically render the 
settlement unfair."" 2 Joseph M. McLaughlin, McLaughlin on Class Actions: Law and Practice § 6:8 (6th ed. 2010); 
see also Ehrheart, 609 F.3d at 605  [**97] (dissenting, Smith, J.) (quoting same). Accordingly, not every factor need 
weigh in favor of settlement in order for the settlement  [*278] to be approved by the Court. See Cendant, 264 F. 3d 
at 242-43 (affirming a final settlement approval when not all factors weighed in favor of approval). Because, on 
balance, the factors as considered above weigh in favor of settlement, the Court concludes that approval of the 
settlement is appropriate pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e).
V. Conclusion
28 See generally In re Ikon Office Solutions, Inc., Secs. Litig., 194 F.R.D. 166, 184 (E.D. Pa. 2000) (""Approval of a plan of 
allocation of a settlement fund in a class action is 'governed by the same standards of review applicable to approval of the 
settlement as a whole: the distribution plan must be fair, reasonable and adequate.' "" (quoting In re Computron Software, Inc., 6 
F. Supp. 2d 313, 321 (D.N.J. 1998));  [**94] Newberg, supra, § 12.35 (same).
29 As discussed earlier, following the final fairness hearing Plaintiffs filed a Motion for an Award of Attorneys' Fees and for 
Reimbursement of Expenses, in which Plaintiffs seek specific amounts for attorneys' fees and reimbursement  [**96] of 
expenses relating to the litigation to be paid from the Moark Settlement. The Court intends to address this Motion separately, 
and does not consider here the substantive arguments presented in that Motion in relation to considering whether the Moark 
Settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate. After all, the Court's inquiry as to this Prudential factor focuses on whether the 
settlement agreement's provision for attorneys' fees are reasonable, and that provision only sets forth that attorneys' fees and 
expenses are subject to Court approval.
284 F.R.D. 249, *277; 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98301, **93

 
For the foregoing reasons, the Court determines that the Class and Subclasses meet the certification requirements 
of Rule 23 for settlement purposes, and concludes that the proposed settlement agreement is fair, reasonable, and 
adequate. Accordingly, the Court grants the Plaintiffs' motion for final approval of the class action settlement with 
Defendants Moark, LLC, Norco Ranch, Inc., and Land O'Lakes, Inc.
An Order consistent with this Memorandum follows.
BY THE COURT:

United States District Judge
ORDER GRANTING FINAL APPROVAL OF THE CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT BETWEEN DIRECT 
PURCHASER PLAINTIFFS AND DEFENDANTS MOARK, LLC, NORCO RANCH, INC., AND LAND O'LAKES, 
INC.
AND NOW, this 16th  [**98] day of July, 2012, upon consideration of the Motion for Final Approval of the Class 
Action Settlement Between Plaintiffs and Defendants Moark, LLC, Norco Ranch, Inc., and Land O'Lakes, Inc. (Doc. 
No. 465), and following a final fairness hearing, in accordance with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, it is hereby 
ORDERED that the Motion (Doc. No. 465) is GRANTED as outlined in this Order and the accompanying 
Memorandum.
Based on the Court's review of the proposed Settlement Agreement Between Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs and 
Defendants Moark, LLC, Norco Ranch, Inc., and Land O'Lakes, Inc. (""Settlement Agreement""), and the entire 
record of this case, and having conducted a final fairness hearing on the matter, the Court determines as follows:
1. The Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of this action.
2. Terms used in this Order that are defined in the Settlement Agreement, unless otherwise defined herein, have 
the same meanings in this Order as in the Settlement Agreement.
3. The following Settlement Class, as defined in the Settlement Agreement, which was conditionally certified in the 
Court's Order granting preliminary approval of this settlement, is certified for settlement purposes  [**99] only as 
follows:
All persons and entities that purchased eggs, including Shell Eggs and Egg Products, produced from caged 
birds in the United States directly from any Producer, including any Defendant, during the Class Period from 
January 1, 2000 through the date when notice of the Court's entry of an order preliminarily approving this 
settlement and certifying a Class for settlement purposes is first published.
a.) Shell Egg SubClass
All individuals and entities that purchased Shell Eggs produced from caged birds in the United States 
directly from any Producer including any Defendant, during the Class Period from January 1, 2000 through 
the date when notice of the Court's entry of an order preliminarily approving this settlement and certifying a 
Class for settlement purposes is first published, excluding individuals and entities that purchased only 
""specialty"" Shell Eggs (certified organic, nutritionally enhanced, cage-free, free-range, and vegetarian-fed 
types) and ""hatching"" Shell Eggs (used by poultry breeders to produce breeder stock or growing stock for 
laying hens or meat).
b.) Egg Products SubClass
284 F.R.D. 249, *278; 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98301, **96

 
All individuals and entities that purchased Egg Products produced from Shell Eggs  [**100] that came from 
caged birds in the United States directly from any Producer, including any Defendant, during the Class 
Period from January 1, 2000 through the date when notice of the Court's entry of an order preliminarily 
approving this settlement and certifying a Class for settlement purposes is first published, excluding 
individuals and entities that purchased only ""specialty"" Egg Products (certified organic, nutritionally 
enhanced, cage-free, free-range, and vegetarian-fed types).
Excluded from the Class and SubClasses are Producers, and their respective parents, subsidiaries and 
affiliates, all government entities, as well as the Court and staff to whom this case is assigned, and any 
member of the Court's or staff's immediate family.
4. The Court finds, as discussed more thoroughly in the accompanying Memorandum, that the Settlement Class 
satisfies the applicable prerequisites for class action treatment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a) and (b). 
The Settlement Class is so numerous that joinder of all members is not practicable, there are questions of law and 
fact common to the Settlement Class, the claims of the Class Representatives are typical of the claims of the 
Settlement  [**101] Class, and the Class Representatives will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the 
Settlement Class. For purposes of this settlement, questions of law and fact common to the members of the 
Settlement Class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and a class action is superior 
to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.
5. Notice of the Settlement Agreement to the Settlement Class required by Rule 23(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil 
Procedure has been provided in accordance with the Court's Orders granting preliminary approval of this settlement 
and notice of this settlement, and such Notice has been given in an adequate and sufficient manner; constitutes the 
best notice practicable under the circumstances; and satisfies Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(c)(2)(B) and 
23(e) and due process.
6. Defendants have filed notification of this settlement with the appropriate federal and state officials pursuant to the 
Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 (""CAFA""), 28 U.S.C. § 1715.
7. As discussed more thoroughly in the accompanying Memorandum, the Court finds that the Settlement 
Agreement is sufficiently fair, reasonable  [**102] and adequate to the Settlement Class pursuant to Federal Rule of 
Civil Procedure 23(e). Specifically, the Court finds that the settlement meets the standard for an initial presumption 
of fairness. Additionally, the Court's analysis of the factors set forth in Girsh v. Jepson, 521 F.2d 153 (3d Cir. 1975), 
and factors set forth in In re Prudential Insurance Co. American Sales Practice Litigation Agent Actions, 148 F.3d 
283 (3d Cir. 1998), as appropriate, leads to the conclusion that the relevant considerations weigh in favor of finding 
the settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(e).
9. The Settlement Agreement is finally approved pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(e) of the Federal 
Rules of Civil Procedure as fair, reasonable, and adequate, and the parties are directed to consummate the 
Settlement Agreement in accordance with its terms.
10. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania shall retain jurisdiction over the 
implementation, enforcement, and performance of this Settlement Agreement, and shall have exclusive jurisdiction 
over any suit, action, motion, proceeding, or dispute arising out of or  [**103] relating to this Settlement Agreement 
or the applicability of this Settlement Agreement that cannot be resolved by negotiation and agreement by Plaintiffs 
and Moark, LLC, Norco Ranch, Inc., and Land O'Lakes, Inc. This Settlement Agreement shall be governed by and 
interpreted according to the substantive laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania without regard to its choice of 
law or conflict of laws principles. Moark, LLC, Norco Ranch, Inc., and Land O'Lakes, Inc. submit to the jurisdiction in 
the Eastern District of Pennsylvania only for the purposes of this Settlement Agreement and the implementation, 
enforcement and performance thereof. Moark, LLC, Norco Ranch, Inc., and Land O'Lakes, Inc. otherwise retain all 
defenses to the Court's exercise of personal jurisdiction over Moark, LLC, Norco Ranch, Inc., and Land O'Lakes, 
Inc.

presently named in this Complaint. See Second Consol. Am. Class  [**9] Action Compl. ¶ 3. 5 Presumably, 
Sparboe's absence is the result of the pending settlement. The following discussion of the nature of the case 
presupposes Sparboe would indeed occupy in the claims going forward the role it was assigned in the claims 
initially if the settlement had not been achieved.
The Court preliminarily approved the Sparboe Settlement and certified the Class and Subclasses for settlement 
purposes following a hearing. See Order on Preliminary Approval of Sparboe Settlement (Doc. No. 214). In the 
same Order, the Court stayed the Plaintiffs' suit against Sparboe pending further Order of the Court. See id. at ¶ 
E.1. In a separate Order, the Court  [**10] also approved the form of notice of the Sparboe Settlement. See Order 
Approving Dissemination of Notice of Settlements Between Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs and (i) Defendant Sparboe 
Farms, Inc. and (ii) Defendants Moark, LLC, Norco Ranch, Inc. and Land O'Lakes, Inc. (Doc. No. 388) (hereinafter, 
""Notice Approval Order"").
Following the notice period established by the Court, Plaintiffs filed the motion sub judice, and the Court held the 
final fairness hearing on the Sparboe Settlement as required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(2). See Sparboe Final 
Approval Hr'g Tr. (Doc. No. 463) (hereinafter, ""Final Hr'g Tr.""). No objections were filed to the proposed Sparboe 
Agreement. No objectors appeared at the fairness hearing. Plaintiffs filed supplemental  [*284] briefing and 
materials in support of their motion for final approval. Following the hearing, the Court withheld ruling on the motion 
until the notice period required pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1715(d) under the Class Action Fairness Act (""CAFA"") had 
elapsed.
C. Moark Settlement
As further background, following the Sparboe Settlement, Defendants Moark, LLC, Norco Ranch, Inc., and Land 
O'Lakes, Inc. (collectively, ""Moark"") entered into a settlement agreement.  [**11] Following a hearing, the Court 
entered Orders preliminarily approving that agreement and the form of notice. See Order on Preliminary Approval of 
Settlement with Moark, LLC, Norco Ranch, Inc., and Land O'Lakes Inc. (Doc. No. 387); Notice Approval Order. 
Following the notice period, Plaintiffs filed a motion seeking final approval of the Moark Settlement, and the Court 
held a final fairness hearing. See Moark Final Approval Hr'g Tr. (Doc. No. 688) (hereinafter, ""Moark Final Hr'g Tr.""). 
In a separate Memorandum and Order issued this same date, the Court is granting the Plaintiffs' motion for final 
approval of the Moark Settlement.
II. Proposed Sparboe Settlement Agreement6
The proposed Settlement Class for settlement purposes under the Sparboe Settlement is defined as:
All persons and entities that purchased eggs, including shell eggs and egg products, produced from caged 
birds in the United States directly from any producer during the Class Period from January 1, 2000 through the 
present.
a.) Shell Egg  [**12] Subclass
All individuals and entities that purchased shell eggs produced from caged birds in the United States 
directly from any during the Class Period from January 1, 2000 through the present.
5 Paragraph 3 of the Second Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint states:
Plaintiffs entered into a Settlement Agreement with Sparboe Farms, Inc. (""Sparboe""), a formerly named Defendant, which 
this Court has preliminarily approved. As part of that Settlement Agreement, Sparboe agreed to cooperate with Plaintiffs 
and provide documents and information related to the allegations in Plaintiffs' initial Complaint. Plaintiffs have incorporated 
much of that information into this Second Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint.
6 The terms used in this Order that are defined in the Sparboe Settlement Agreement are, unless otherwise defined herein, used 
in this Order consistent with the definitions of the agreement.
284 F.R.D. 278, *283; 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98302, **8

 
b.) Egg Products Subclass
All individuals and entities that purchased egg products produced from shell eggs that came from caged 
birds in the United States directly from any producer during the Class Period from January 1, 2000 through 
the present.
Excluded from the class and subclasses are the Defendants, their co-conspirators, and their respective 
parents, subsidiaries and affiliates, all government entities, as well as the Court and staff to whom this case is 
assigned, and any member of the Court's or staff's immediate family. Also excluded from the Class and 
Subclasses are purchases of ""specialty"" shell egg or egg products (such as ""organic,"" ""free-range"" or ""cage-
free"") and purchases of hatching eggs (used by poultry breeders to produce breeder stock or growing stock for 
laying hens or meat).
Mot., Ex. A, Settlement Agreement Between Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs and Sparboe Farms, Inc. ¶ 11 (hereinafter, 
""Sparboe Settlement Agreement""). 7 As mentioned earlier, the Court preliminarily certified  [**13] the Settlement 
Class for settlement purposes under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3). See Order on Preliminary Approval of Sparboe 
Settlement. The agreement's principal terms require Sparboe to cooperate with the Plaintiffs' preparation  [*285] for 
and prosecution of their class action. See Moark Settlement Agreement ¶ 23. The Agreement details the extent of 
Sparboe's cooperation in terms of ""making documents related to the claims asserted in this action available for 
review and making witnesses with knowledge related to the claims asserted in this action available for informal 
interviews and, as necessary, consultation with Plaintiffs' Counsel."" Id. ""Sparboe Farms agree[d] to provide 
discovery to Plaintiffs in the pending Action as if Sparboe Farms were a party subject to all rules for discovery."" Id. 
Sparboe agreed to ""use its best efforts to produce interviewees . . . who are current or former directors, officers, or 
employees of Sparboe Farms for deposition at the time discovery in this Action commences . . . and make those 
person available for trial testimony."" Id. ¶ 23(a).
In consideration, Plaintiffs and their counsel ""agree not to assert that Sparboe Farms waived its attorney-client 
privilege, work product immunity or any other privilege or protection with respect to information or documents 
 [**15] provided or identified"" to Plaintiffs pursuant to the Agreement. Id. ¶ 24.
Furthermore, Plaintiffs agree that they ""shall not . . . seek to recover against [Sparboe] for any of the Released 
Claims."" Id. ¶ 17. Under the Agreement, ""Released Claims"" are defined as any and all claims arising out of injuries 
or damages that occurred ""from the beginning of time to the date of this Agreement"" and that arose out of or 
resulted from ""conduct concerning any agreement among Defendants, the reduction or restraint of supply, the 
reduction of or restrictions on production capacity, or the pricing, selling, discounting, marketing, or distributing of 
Shell Eggs and Processed Egg Products in the United States or elsewhere. Id. The Agreement sets forth non-
exclusive examples of Released Claims by providing that such claims ""includ[e] but [are] not limited to any conduct 
alleged, and causes of action asserted, or that could have been alleged or asserted, whether or not concealed or 
hidden, in the Complaints filed in the Action . . . , which arise from or are predicated on the facts and/or actions 
described in the Complaints under any federal, state, or foreign antirust, unfair competition, unfair practices, 
 [**16] price discrimination, unitary pricing, trade practice, consumer protection, fraud, RICO, civil conspiracy law, or 
7 In the Agreement, ""Class Period"" is defined as ""the period from and including January 1, 2000 up to and including the date 
 [**14] when Notice of the Court's entry of an order preliminarily approving this settlement and certifying a class for settlement 
purposes is first published."" Id. ¶ 5. Thus, the Class Period for the Sparboe Settlement is from January 1, 2000 through October 
23, 2009.
This actual Class Period contrasts with the end date for the Class Period listed in the Notice of the Sparboe Settlement, which is 
stated as July 15, 2010. See Mot., Ex. 2.A., Notice of Sparboe Settlement at 2 (Doc. No. 443-6) (hereinafter, ""Sparboe Notice""). 
It appears that the date listed in the Sparboe Notice is an inadvertent typo. July 15, 2010 is the end date of the class period for 
the Moark Settlement (and the date on which the Court preliminarily approved the Moark Settlement and the notices of the 
Sparboe and Moark Settlements). See Order on Preliminary Approval of Settlement with Moark, LLC, Norco Ranch, Inc., and 
Land O'Lakes Inc.; Notice Approval Order; Mot., Ex. 2.A., Notice of Moark Settlement at 2.

similar laws, including, without limitation, the Sherman Antitrust Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1 et seq."" Id. Plaintiffs also agree 
to waive California Civil Code Section 1542 and similar provisions in other states. Id. ¶ 17(a). Additionally, Plaintiffs 
agree to waive and release ""any and all defenses, rights, and benefits that [Plaintiffs] may have or that may be 
derived from the provisions of applicable law which, absent such waiver, may limit the extent or effect of the 
release"" set forth in the Agreement. Id. ¶ 18. The release excludes ""claims relating to payment disputes, physical 
harm, defective product or bodily injury . . . and do[es] not include any Non-Settling Defendant."" Id. ¶ 19.
The settlement proposes an opt-out provision which sets forth the procedures through which possible class 
members could opt out of the settlement. Id. ¶ 14; see also Sparboe Notice at 1, 4. Class members had 75 days 
from the postmark date that the notice of the settlement was mailed by first-class mail to the final postmark date 
designated in the Claims Notice to return an exclusion request or  [**17] submit an objection to the Settlement. See 
Sparboe Notice at 1, 3, 4; Mot., Ex. 2, Affidavit of Jennifer M. Keough re: Notice and Settlement Administration ¶¶ 
9, 17 (Doc. No. 443-5) (hereinafter, ""Keough Aff."").
Finally, the Agreement delineates Sparboe's agreement to reimburse Plaintiffs up to a maximum of $350,000.00 
towards the cost of notice of the Settlement."" Sparboe Settlement Agreement ¶ 28. However, this provision is 
subject to several provisos, one of which provides that ""[i]n the event Plaintiffs enter into a cash settlement with any 
Non-Settling Defendant and receive preliminary approval of that settlement prior to the issuance of notice under this 
Agreement (such that the settlement notices can be combined), Plaintiffs shall apply those settlement funds 
towards the cost of notice, thus reducing or eliminating Sparboe Farms' obligation to reimburse Plaintiffs for the 
notice costs of this Agreement."" Id. ¶ 29.
 [*286]  III. Notice of Sparboe Settlement
Notice of the Sparboe Settlement was disseminated to possible members of the Settlement Class through a variety 
of means ranging from direct mailings, publications, press releases, a website and a toll-free information and 
request telephone  [**18] line. See Keough Aff. ¶¶ 5-6; see also Sparboe Settlement Agreement ¶ 13. The Notice 
explained that any possible Class Members wishing to be excluded from or to object to the terms of the Sparboe 
Settlement Agreement should postmark their exclusion requests or objections no later than a specific date that was 
58 days before the final fairness hearing on the Sparboe Settlement. See Sparboe Notice at 1, 3-4. Notices of the 
Moark and Sparboe Settlements were jointly distributed to the putative Class members, and $170,000 was spent on 
notice expenses with respect to the Sparboe Settlement Agreement. See Moark Final Hr'g Tr. at 31:3-31-23. No 
other information has been provided to the Court concerning whether other administrative costs and expenses were 
(or were not) incurred in relation to the Sparboe Settlement.
The Claims Administrator received no objections to the Sparboe Settlement and received 364 requests for 
exclusion from the Sparboe Settlement Class. See Keough Aff. ¶ 17. Some of those parties who opted-out of the 
class have filed their own complaints against Defendants, including Sparboe, such as Direct Action Plaintiffs Giant 
Eagle, Inc., Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc., Roundy's Supermarkets,  [**19] Inc., C&S Wholesale Grocers, Inc., H.J. Heinz 
Company, L.P., Publix Super Markets, Inc., Kraft Foods Global, Inc., The Kellogg Company, General Mills, Inc., and 
Nestle USA, Inc., The Kroger Co., The Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., Inc., Hy-Vee, Inc., H.E. Butt Grocery Co., 
Conopco, Inc., Safeway Inc., Albertsons LLC, and Walgreen Co., and Supervalu, Inc., as well as plaintiffs in a state 
court action proceeding in Kansas. 8 Interim Co-Lead Counsel has represented that the potential Class for the

Moark Settlement ""is composed of thousands of entities nationwide, many of which are sophisticated companies 
with their own in-house legal counsel,"" Fees Mot. at 12, a descriptor which the Court recognizes can be applied to 
the Sparboe Settlement Class, given that both settlements' classes are defined virtually identically.
The Claims Administrator mailed Notice and Claim Forms to 13,211 direct purchasers of shell eggs and egg 
products, whose names and addresses were obtained from various electronic data files that contained potential 
Class Member names and addresses from 17 named egg producer Defendants that were given to the Claims 
Administrator at the direction of the Court. See Keough Aff. ¶ 7, 9; Notice Approval Order ¶ 3. Eighty-three (83) 
Notice and Claim Forms, returned by the U.S. Postal Service with forwarding address information, were re-mailed. 
See id. ¶ 12. In contrast, twenty-three hundred  [*287] thirty-nine (2,339) Notice and Claim Forms were returned 
without forwarding address information and, according to Interim Co-Lead Counsel, could not be re-mailed. See 
 [**22] id. 9
Additionally, during the notice period a Summary Notice was published in several publications with a total circulation 
of over 2,316,000. See id. ¶ 11. The Summary Notice was published in a monthly issue of fifteen (15) industry 
journals thought to be likely to reach potential purchasers of shell eggs and egg products. See id. Those 
publications are: PetFood Industry, Restaurant Business, Convenience Store News, Hotel F&B, Nation's 
Restaurant News, Food Service Director, Progressive Grocer, Food Manufacturing, Supermarket News, Stores, 
Egg Industry Magazine, Modern Baking, Baking Buyer, Food Processing, and Long Term Living. See id.
The Summary Notice was also published for one day in the Wall Street Journal. See id. That same day, the Claims 
Administrator distributed a press release for the Sparboe Settlement, as well as a separate release about the Moark 
Settlement, to approximately 1,000 journalists in the  [**23] restaurant and food industries through the US1 
Newsline on the PR Newswire. See id. ¶ 13. The press releases resulted in some 335 articles that reported on the 
two settlements. See id.
A publicly-available website specifically devoted to the Sparboe and Moark Settlements was established. See id. ¶ 
14. The website makes available for review and downloading the Notice Packet, the Sparboe Settlement 
Agreement, and various Court orders and filings relating to the Sparboe Settlement. See id. In the first 106 days of 
operation, the website received 2,821 ""visits."" See id.
The Claims Administrator and Plaintiffs established a toll-free 24-hour telephone number and call center for 
potential Class Members to obtain information about the settlement and to request the Notice and Claim Form. See 
id. ¶ 15. The automated number received 328 calls, and 61 callers requested and received a Notice Packet during 
the first 106 days of operation. See id.
Additionally, Sparboe served notice of the settlement to federal and state officials of the settlement pursuant to 28 
U.S.C. § 1715(d) under CAFA. See Final Hr'g Tr. at 26:23-26:24, 38:1-38:6. No federal or state officials filed 
against Defendants in Kansas state court, which, after being removed to federal court by Defendants, was remanded to state 
court); Direct Action Plaintiff Status Report (Doc. No. 457).
The Direct Action Plaintiff Status Report states that ""[a]ll of the Direct Action Plaintiffs . . . have opted out of the Sparboe class 
settlement and will play no role in the fairness hearing."" Id. at 2. This statement applies only to the presently pending Direct 
Action Plaintiff cases brought by The Kroger Co. and co-plaintiffs (Civil Action No. 10-7605 (E.D. Pa.)), Supervalu Inc. (Civil 
Action No. 10-6736 (E.D. Pa.)), Publix Super Markets, Inc. (Civil Action No. 10-6737 (E.D. Pa.)), and Giant Eagle, Inc. (Civil 
Action No. 10-1698 (W.D. Pa.)).
The statement does not apply to the  [**21] pending Direct Action Plaintiff cases brought by Kraft Foods Global, Inc. and its co-
plaintiffs (Civil Action No. 11-8808 (E.D. Pa.)), and Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc. (Civil Action No. 11-0510 (E.D. Pa.)). Both of these 
cases were filed after the Status Report. However, it appears that Kraft Foods Global, Inc. and its co-plaintiffs, and Winn-Dixie 
Stores, Inc. and its co-plaintiffs, have opted out of the Sparboe Settlement. See Keough Aff. ¶ 17.
9 The Court recognizes that the statistics provided here slightly differ with the equivalent statistics that the Plaintiffs provided in 
connection with their motion for approval of the Moark Settlement. However, the Court deems these minor differences to be 
inconsequential.

objections to the Sparboe  [**24] Settlement, nor requested a hearing following the issuance of the CAFA notice. 
The statutory period elapsed prior to the date of this Memorandum and accompanying Order. 10
 [*288]  IV. Discussion
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 provides that ""[t]he claims, issues, or defenses of a certified class may be 
settled, voluntarily dismissed, or compromised only with the court's approval."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e). The following 
procedures apply to a proposed settlement, voluntary dismissal, or compromise:
(1) The court must direct notice in a reasonable manner to all class members who would be bound by the 
proposal.
(2) If the proposal would bind class members, the court may approve it only after a hearing and on finding that 
it is fair, reasonable, and adequate.
(3) The parties seeking approval must file a statement identifying any agreement made in connection with the 
proposal.
(4) If the class action was previously certified under Rule 23(b)(3), the court may refuse to approve a 
settlement unless it affords a new opportunity to request exclusion to individual class members who had an 
earlier  [**27] opportunity to request exclusion but did not do so.
(5) Any class member may object to the proposal if it requires court approval under this subdivision (e); the 
objection may be withdrawn only with the court's approval.
Id. The ""[f]actual determinations necessary to make Rule 23 findings must be made by a preponderance of the 
evidence. In other words, to certify a class the district court must find that the evidence more likely than not 
establishes each fact necessary to meet the requirements of Rule 23."" In re Ins. Brokerage Antitrust Litig., 579 F.3d 
241, 257-58 (3d Cir. 2009) (quoting In re Hydrogen Peroxide Antitrust Litig., 552 F.3d 305, 320 (3d Cir. 2008)). ""The 
decision of whether to approve a proposed settlement of a class action is left to the sound discretion of the district 
court."" In re Prudential Ins. Co. Am. Sales Practice Litig. Agent Actions, 148 F.3d 283, 299 (3d Cir. 1998) (quoting 
Girsh v. Jepson, 521 F.2d 153, 156 (3d Cir. 1975)).
10 Although Sparboe served notice of the settlement to the appropriate officials, it did not do so promptly after the Agreement 
was filed, as required by 28 U.S.C. § 1715(b). Mot. at 7. Section 1715(b) provides: ""Not later than 10 days after a proposed 
settlement of a class action is filed in court, each defendant that is participating in the proposed settlement shall serve upon the 
appropriate State official of each State in which a class member resides and the appropriate Federal official, a notice of the 
proposed settlement . . . ."" Under Section 1715(d), an order granting final approval of a settlement agreement may not take 
place earlier than ninety days after the appropriate federal and state officials have been served with notice.
Plaintiffs advised the Court about the timing of the CAFA notice requirement on the Sparboe and Moark Settlements, and 
requested the Court proceed with the final approval hearing on the Sparboe Settlement as scheduled and to hold its decision on 
the Plaintiffs' motion for final approval  [**25] in abeyance until the ninety-day expiration date passed without any objections or 
requests for hearings being received from any relevant authority pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1715(d). See Mot. at 7. Over ninety 
days have elapsed since Sparboe served the appropriate state or federal officials with the CAFA notice, and there have been no 
requests for hearings or objections to the settlement. It follows that, although the notice requirements under CAFA have not 
been fully met on a technical basis, the substance of the requirements have been satisfied insofar as giving federal and state 
officials sufficient notice and opportunity to be heard concerning the Sparboe Settlement. See D.S. ex rel. S.S. v. New York City 
Dep't of Educ., 255 F.R.D. 59, 80 (E.D.N.Y. 2008) (approving the settlement on a provisional basis until the CAFA notice 
deadline passes and no federal or state official requests a hearing); Kay Co. v. Equitable Prod. Co., No. 06 Civ. 00612, 2010 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 41892, 2010 WL 1734869, at *4 (S.D. W.Va. Apr. 28, 2010) (""Since more than 100 days have passed since 
service was perfected and since there have been no adverse comments from any of the aforesaid State or Federal officials, the 
Court FINDS that compliance  [**26] with CAFA is satisfactory.""). But see True v. Am. Honda Motor Co., 749 F. Supp. 2d 1052, 
1083 (C.D. Cal. 2010) (determining that its authority to approve a settlement was ""questionable"" when the defendant gave CAFA 
notice only ten days prior to the final settlement approval hearing).

A. Class Certification
Where, as here, the Court has not already certified a class prior to evaluating a settlement, the Court initially must 
determine whether the proposed settlement classes satisfy the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 
23(a)  [**28] and (b). See Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 619, 117 S. Ct. 2231, 138 L. Ed. 2d 689 
(1997); see also In re Pet Food Prods. Liab. Litig., 629 F.3d 333, 341 (3d Cir. 2010) (""[A] district court first must 
determine that the requirements for class certification under Rule 23(a) and (b) are met.""). The Third Circuit Court of 
Appeals recently summarized the demands of Rule 23 as follows:
Rule 23(a) contains four threshold requirements, which every putative class must satisfy:
(1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable; (2) there are questions of law or 
fact common to the class; (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims 
or defenses of the class; and (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of 
the class.
Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a); see also Amchem, 521 U.S. at 613. Upon finding each of these prerequisites satisfied, a 
district court must then determine that the proposed class fits within one of the categories of class actions 
enumerated in Rule 23(b).
As mentioned, Rule 23(b)(2) authorizes class actions seeking injunctive relief in instances where the defendant 
""has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply  [**29] generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief . . . 
is appropriate respecting the class as a whole."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2); see In re Comm. Bank of N. Va. 
(Comm. Bank I), 418 F.3d 277, 302 n.14 (2005). Separately, certification pursuant to Rule 23(b)(3) seeking 
monetary compensation is permitted where (1) ""questions of law or fact common to class members 
predominate  [*289] over any questions affecting only individual members,"" and (2) ""a class action is superior 
to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3); see 
Collins v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours & Co., 34 F.3d 172, 180 (3d Cir. 1994). These twin requirements are 
commonly referred to as predominance and superiority.
Sullivan v. DB Invs., Inc., 667 F.3d 273, 296 (3d Cir. 2011) (en banc).
1. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a)
First, under Rule 23(a), the Court determines that the Class Members are ascertainable from objective criteria, such 
as various electronic data files that contained names and addresses of customers that purchased shell eggs or egg 
products produced from caged birds in the United States, which were provided by 17 named egg producer 
Defendants, and  [**30] that the Class Members thus ascertained are so numerous that their joinder before the 
Court would be impracticable. Plaintiffs ""need not precisely enumerate the potential size of the proposed class, nor 
[are] plaintiff[s] required to demonstrate that joinder would be impossible."" Cannon v. Cherry Hill Toyota, Inc., 184 
F.R.D. 540, 543 (D.N.J. 1999) (citation omitted); see also 7A Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal 
Practice and Procedure § 1762 (3d ed. 2005) (""'[I]mpracticable' does not mean 'impossible.' The representatives 
only need to show that it is extremely difficult or inconvenient to join all the members of the class.""); 1 A. Conte & H. 
Newberg, Class Actions § 3:14 (5th ed. 2011) (""Plaintiffs bear the burden of demonstrating that joinder is 
impracticable, but impracticable does not mean impossible.""). ""[G]enerally if the named plaintiff demonstrates that 
the potential number of plaintiffs exceeds 40, the first prong of Rule 23(a) has been met."" Stewart v. Abraham, 275 
F.3d 220, 226-27 (3d Cir. 2001) (citation omitted). Here, thousands of direct purchasers of shell eggs and egg 
products located across the United States were identified, based upon consumer information  [**31] provided by 17 
named Defendants, as proposed members of the Settlement Class. This information certainly demonstrates that a 
class of this size makes individual joinder of all members impracticable and that the numerosity requirement is 
satisfied.
284 F.R.D. 278, *288; 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98302, **26

 
Second, the commonality requirement is satisfied insofar as Plaintiffs have alleged one or more questions of fact 
and law common throughout the Class. The commonality prerequisite does not require that all members of the 
prospective class share identical claims. Hassine v. Jeffes, 846 F.2d 169, 176-77 (3d Cir. 1988) (relying on 
Eisenberg v. Gagnon, 766 F.2d 770, 786 (3d Cir. 1985)). Rather, ""[t]he commonality requirement will be satisfied if 
the named plaintiffs share at least one question of fact or law with the grievances of the prospective class."" Baby 
Neal v. Casey, 43 F.3d 48, 56 (3d Cir. 1994). Also, class members can assert such a single common complaint if 
they demonstrate that all class members are subject to the same harm. Id. 11
As is also further discussed in regards to the superiority requirement under Rule 23(b)(3), infra, the Plaintiffs' claims 
against Sparboe are based upon its alleged conduct during the period in question, which Plaintiffs contend 
constituted an agreement to and furtherance of an unlawful conspiracy to manipulate the supply and prices of 
domestic eggs and egg products in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. See generally Sept. 26, 2011 Mem., 
821 F. Supp. 2d at 713-15 (discussing the specific alleged conduct of Defendants generally in furtherance of 
alleged conspiracy). 12 Additionally, Plaintiffs  [*290] allegedly were subjected to the same type of harm by directly 
purchasing eggs and egg products at artificially inflated prices due to the alleged conspiracy. Because the class 
members' claims arise from the same nucleus of operative facts and involve  [**33] the same legal theories against 
Sparboe, the Court finds that the commonality prong under Rule 23(a)(2) is met.
Third, the Court finds that the claims of the named Plaintiffs—companies, corporations, and businesses that 
purchased shell eggs, egg products, or both, from one or more of the Defendants—are typical of the claims of the 
Class Members and the respective Subclass members. ""If the claims of the named plaintiffs  [**34] and putative 
class members involve the same conduct by the defendant, typicality is established regardless of factual 
differences."" Newton v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., 259 F.3d 154, 183-84 (3d Cir. 2001). The Third 
Circuit Court of Appeals has recognized that the ""jurisprudence 'assures that a claim framed as a violative practice 
can support a class action embracing a variety of injuries so long as those injuries can all be linked to the practice.'"" 
Id. at 184 (quoting Baby Neal, 43 F.3d at 63). In this action, the claims of the class representatives are aligned with 
those of the Class Members, and members of the Subclasses, inasmuch as the claims of the representatives arise 
out of the same alleged misconduct of the Defendants and core facts and events. Further, the representative 
Plaintiffs' claims and the absent Class Members' claims rely on the same legal theories and arise from the same 
alleged ""conspiracy"" and ""illegal agreement"" by Defendants. Moreover, named Plaintiffs, like all putative Class 
Members, allegedly have suffered the same injury-namely, economic damages arising from alleged artificially-
inflated purchase prices-as a result of the Defendants'  [**35] alleged anticompetitive conduct.
Fourth, the final prerequisite under Rule 23(a), the adequacy of the representative parties requirement, ""has two 
components: (1) concerning the experience and performance of class counsel; and (2) concerning the interests and 
incentives of the representative plaintiffs."" Dewey v. Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft, 681 F.3d 170, 182 (3d Cir. 
2012) (citing Comm. Bank I, 418 F.3d at 303). Essentially, the inquiry into the adequacy of the representative 
parties examines whether ""the putative named plaintiff has the ability and the incentive to represent the claims of 
the class vigorously, that he or she has obtained adequate counsel, and that there is no conflict between the 
11 The Supreme Court recently explained: ""What matters to class certification . . . is not the raising of common 'questions'—even 
in droves—but, rather the capacity of a classwide proceeding to generate common  [**32] answers apt to drive the resolution of 
the litigation. Dissimilarities within the proposed class are what have the potential to impede the generation of common 
answers."" Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 131 S. Ct. 2541, 2551, 180 L. Ed. 2d 374 (2011) (quoting Richard A. Nagareda, Class 
Certification in the Age of Aggregate Proof, 84 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 97, 132 (2009)).
12 For purposes of this Motion and in considering the Plaintiffs' claims against Sparboe, the Court considers Sparboe as a named 
Defendant in this suit even though it is not named as a defendant in the operative pleading, the Second Consolidated Amended 
Class Action Complaint. The Court recognizes that the Order preliminarily approving the Sparboe Settlement stayed the suit 
against Sparboe and was entered prior to the filing of the Second Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint. As explained 
above, the Court determines that if Sparboe had been named as a defendant in the Second Consolidated Amended, the claims 
against it would not have substantively differed from the essence of the claims against it asserted in the First Consolidated 
Amended Class Action Complaint.

individual's claims and those asserted on behalf of the class."" Hassine, 846 F.2d 169 at 179 (citations omitted); see 
also Dewey, 681 F.3d at 182 (recognizing that ""the linchpin of the adequacy requirement is the alignment of 
interests and incentives between the representative plaintiffs and the rest of the class""). In other words, ""Rule 
23(a)(4) serves to uncover conflicts of interest between named parties and the class they seek to represent."" 
Amchem, 521 U.S. at 625. If any conflicts  [**36] ""undercut the representative plaintiffs' ability to adequately 
represent the class"" they are ""fundamental,"" such that class representation is structurally faulty and Rule 23(a)(4) 
cannot be satisfied. Dewey, 681 F.3d at 184-85.
The Court determines that the representative Plaintiffs indeed will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the 
Settlement Class. Here, the interests of the representative Plaintiffs are consistent with those of the Class 
members, and respective Subclass members, and there appear to be no conflicts between or among these groups. 
As discussed, the representative Plaintiffs were damaged as a result of the Defendants' allegedly unlawful conduct, 
including Sparboe's alleged conduct, and the named Plaintiffs would have had to prove the same wrongdoing as 
the putative Class Members to establish the Defendants' (and Sparboe's) liability. Moreover, all representative 
Plaintiffs  [*291] and Class Members have present claims (and no future claims) and have suffered economic 
damages. Furthermore, there is no apparent conflict among Class Members, or Subclasses, with respect to the 
allocations for distribution of monetary consideration because the Agreement does not set forth  [**37] such 
consideration. The representative and putative Class Members have a common interest in Sparboe's cooperation in 
assisting with the prosecution of the class claims against the non-settling Defendants. 13 It follows that the 
representative Plaintiffs' interests are directly aligned with those of other members of the Class and Subclasses.
Additionally, the representative Plaintiffs have been, have the incentive, and appear to be capable of continuing to 
be active participants in both the prosecution and the settlement of this suit against Sparboe, if the case had 
continued, and against the remaining Defendants. To assist them, Plaintiffs have retained attorneys who are highly 
qualified, experienced, and able to conduct this litigation. The Court analyzes the capabilities and performance of 
Interim Co-Lead Counsel under Rule 23(a)(4) based upon the factors set forth in Rule 23(g). See Sheinberg v. 
Sorensen, 606 F.3d 130, 132 (3d Cir. 2010) (""Although questions concerning the adequacy of class counsel were 
traditionally analyzed under the aegis of the adequate representation requirement of Rule 23(a)(4) of the Federal 
Rules of Civil Procedure, those questions have, since 2003, been governed by Rule 23(g)."" (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 
23(g) note (2003))).
Here, the Court concludes that Interim Co-Lead Counsel satisfies Rule 23(g). Rule 23(g) requires consideration of 
four factors:  [**39] ""the work counsel has done in identifying or investigating potential claims in the action,"" 
""counsel's experience in handling class actions, other complex litigation, and ""the types of claims asserted in the 
action,"" ""counsel's knowledge of the applicable law,"" and ""the resources that counsel will commit to representing the 
class."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(g)(1)(A)(i)-(iv). The Court ""must also ensure that '[c]lass counsel [will] fairly and 
adequately represent the interests of the class.'"" Sheinberg, 606 F.3d at 132-33 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(g)(4)). 
14
13 The possible diversity among the Class members in terms of financial resources—for example, a national corporate entity as 
compared to the proprietor of a neighborhood restaurant—and the implications of that diversity was discussed during the 
preliminary approval hearing. In particular, the possibility was raised that a class member with less financial resources might find 
a monetary settlement with Sparboe more beneficial than a class member with greater financial resources. In response, Interim 
Co-Lead Counsel explained that all Class members equally benefit from advancing the entire suit against the remaining 
Defendants which would enable them to obtain the ""aggregate damages"" the Class members would be entitled to, and that, 
indeed, a Class member with less financial resources might obtain greater benefit from Sparboe's cooperation than a larger 
 [**38] producer in this nonmonetary consideration when considered in light of the relative scale of the costs of bringing this suit. 
Prelim. Hr'g Tr. 22:7-22:13.
14 The Court may also consider other possibly relevant information as to the adequacy of counsel, such as proposed terms for 
attorneys' fees and nontaxable costs and ""any other matter pertinent to counsel's ability to fairly and adequately represent the 
interests of the class."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(g)(1)(B), (C).

Interim Co-Lead Counsel have extensive documented experience in complex class action litigation, including those 
based upon violations of antitrust law, and are well-respected law firms in the plaintiffs' class action bar who have 
demonstrated considerable dedication and ability thus far in this litigation. Interim Co-Lead Counsel  [**40] have 
capably managed this suit on behalf of Plaintiffs since the Court formally appointed them to that role. Their work has 
included the consolidation of the individual cases, negotiating the Sparboe and Moark Settlements, handling the 
motion to dismiss stage, and preparing for and commencing discovery. In sum, Interim Co-Lead Counsel's work on 
behalf of the Plaintiffs has been extensive and involved the dedication of substantial resources and energy. Interim 
Co-Lead Counsel's work thus far in this suit and prior experience demonstrate that these attorneys have fairly and 
adequately represented the interests of the Sparboe Settlement Class, and Subclasses, and will continue to do so.
Accordingly, the Court finds that four threshold requirements of Rule 23(a) have been satisfied.
 [*292]  2. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)
Having determined that the requirements of Rule 23(a) are met, the Court next must consider whether the 
requirements of at least one subsection of Rule 23(b) are met. Here, Plaintiffs are seeking certification under Rule 
23(b)(3). See also Pls.' Mem. of Law on Prelim. Approval of Sparboe Settlement at 24 (Doc. No. 172). Rule 23(b)(3) 
permits class actions where ""the court  [**41] finds that the questions of law or fact common to Class members 
predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and that a class action is superior to other 
available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3). These 
requirements are commonly separated into the so-called ""predominance"" and ""superiority"" requirements. See Ins. 
Brokerage, 579 F.3d at 257-58.
a. Predominance
To evaluate the predominance requirement, a court must determine whether common questions of law or fact 
predominate over any questions affecting only individual members. See Hydrogen Peroxide, 552 F.3d at 311-12. 
""Rule 23(b)(3)'s predominance requirement imposes a more rigorous obligation [than Rule 23(a)(2)'s commonality 
element] upon a reviewing court to ensure that issues common to the class predominate over those affecting only 
individual class members. Sullivan, 667 F.3d at 297 (quoting Ins. Broker., 579 F.3d at 266). As such, the Third 
Circuit Court of Appeals ""consider[s] the Rule 23(a) commonality requirement to be incorporated into the more 
stringent Rule 23(b)(3) predominance requirement, and therefore deem[s] it appropriate to 'analyze the  [**42] two 
factors together, with particular focus on the predominance requirement.'"" Id. (quoting In re Warfarin Sodium 
Antitrust Litig., 391 F.3d 516, 528 (3d Cir. 2004)). Third Circuit precedent ""provides that the focus of the 
predominance inquiry is on whether the defendant's conduct was common as to all of the class members, and 
whether all of the class members were harmed by the defendant's conduct."" Id.
""Predominance is a test readily met in certain cases alleging . . . violations of the antitrust laws."" Amchem, 521 U.S. 
at 625. This is because these types of claims typically arise from an alleged common course of conduct on the part 
of the defendant, and depend upon common proof of liability, such as evidence of the defendants' conduct. See, 
e.g., Warfarin, 391 F.3d at 528 (questions of fact and law are common to the class because the claims at issue and 
proof of liability depend upon the defendants' alleged conduct). Furthermore, that Plaintiffs have allegedly suffered 
""purely an economic injury""—in contrast to a physical injury—such overpayment for a product on account of the 
Defendants', and more specifically, Sparboe's, alleged anticompetitive conduct can ""further support[] a finding 
 [**43] of commonality and predominance because there are little or no individual proof problems in this case 
otherwise commonly associated with physical injury claims."" Id. at 529.
Indeed, this same rationale leads the Court to conclude here that the common issues of Class Members 
predominate over any individual issues as to their antitrust claim against Sparboe. The task at hand requires the 
Court to ""examine the elements of plaintiffs' claim through the prism of Rule 23."" Hydrogen Peroxide, 552 F.3d at 
311 (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, the Plaintiffs' claim arises under Section 1 of the Sherman Act. ""To 
284 F.R.D. 278, *291; 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98302, **38

 
establish a violation of Section 1, a plaintiff must prove: (1) concerted action by the defendants; (2) that produced 
anticompetitive effects within the relevant product and geographic markets; (3) that the concerted actions were 
illegal; and (4) that it was injured as a proximate result of the concerted action."" Gordon v. Lewistown Hosp., 423 
F.3d 184, 207 (3d Cir. 2005).
The reasoning in In re Insurance Brokerage Antitrust Litigation is applicable here. In Insurance Brokerage, our 
Court of Appeals concluded that ""[b]ecause each of the elements of a Sherman Act violation involves 
 [**44] common questions of law and fact, . . . common questions predominate over individual ones with respect to 
the federal antitrust claim."" 579 F.3d at 269. The Court determined that since ""the first and third elements  [*293] of 
a Sherman Act violation focus on the conduct of the defendants, we find that common questions abound with 
respect to whether the defendants engaged in illegal, concerted action."" Id. at 268. This is true in this case, 
because the common questions relevant to these elements include, inter alia, whether Sparboe and the other 
Defendants agreed to the alleged conspiracy to manipulate the supply and prices of domestic eggs and egg 
products in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, and whether the alleged conspirators' conduct amounted to 
an illegal restraint of trade. Furthermore, with respect to the second element of the Plaintiffs' Section 1 claim, there 
are at the very least the common questions relating to whether the alleged conspirators' actions reduced the supply 
of and increased prices for domestic eggs and egg products.
Also, like Insurance Brokerage, here, the fourth element of the Sherman Act claim ""focuses on whether the plaintiffs 
were injured by the defendants'  [**45] conduct,"" and as a result ""it may still involve common questions of law and 
fact if proof of injury can be established on a class-wide basis."" Id. at 269. As the Court of Appeals recognized, ""for 
purposes of class certification pursuant to Rule 23(b)(3), 'the task for plaintiffs . . . is to demonstrate that the 
element of antitrust impact is capable of proof at trial through evidence that is common to the class rather than 
individual to its members.'"" Id. (citing Hydrogen Peroxide, 552 F.3d at 311-12. The issue here is whether the Class 
Members were proximately injured by the conduct of Sparboe and other Defendants, which is a question that is 
capable of proof common to the class members. Thus, even though the amount of damage that each plaintiff 
allegedly suffered could not necessarily be established by common proof, nonetheless, ""the element of antitrust 
injury—that is, the fact of damages—is susceptible to common proof."" Id. The reasoning in Insurance Brokerage 
applies here:
[W]e are not as concerned with ""formulat[ing] some prediction"" as to how this element of a Sherman Act 
violation would ""play out"" at trial, [Hydrogen Peroxide,] 552 F.3d at 311 (internal quotation marks omitted), 
 [**46] ""for the proposal is that there be no trial,"" Amchem, 521 U.S. at 620, and instead our inquiry into the 
element of antitrust injury is solely for the purpose of ensuring that issues common to the class predominate 
over individual ones. As the foregoing analysis demonstrates, common questions exist even with respect to the 
element of antitrust injury and therefore any individual issues do not overwhelm the common ones.
Id.
Furthermore, the Court does not find that the use of Subclasses of direct purchasers of eggs and direct purchasers 
of egg products alters any of the foregoing analysis because the claims with respect to each Subclass rely upon the 
same alleged conduct of Sparboe and other Defendants, common proof of such conduct, and economic harm of 
overpayment for the respective products resulting from such conduct. Accordingly, the Court concludes that the 
predominance requirement is satisfied here because each element of the Plaintiffs' federal antitrust violation 
involves common questions of law and fact, and these common questions predominate over individual issues.
b. Superiority
To meet the superiority requirement, Plaintiffs must show that a class action, rather than individual  [**47] litigation 
or other available methods of adjudication, is the best method for achieving a fair and efficient adjudication of the 
controversy. See Newton, 259 F.3d at 191. Several factors are relevant to the superiority inquiry: ""(A) the class 
members' interests in individually controlling the prosecution or defense of separate actions; (B) the extent and 
284 F.R.D. 278, *292; 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98302, **43

 
nature of any litigation concerning the controversy already begun by or against class members; (C) the desirability 
or undesirability of concentrating the litigation of the claims in the particular forum; and (D) the likely difficulties in 
managing a class action."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3). In effect, ""[t]he superiority requirement asks the court to balance, 
in terms of fairness and efficiency, the merits of a class action against those of alternative available methods of 
adjudication.""  [*294]  Prudential, 148 F.3d at 316 (internal quotations omitted).
The Court makes no determination at this time concerning the manageability of the Plaintiffs' suit as a class action if 
this action were to go to trial in a single forum or, to the extent this possibility remains, be remanded to the various 
transferor courts. ""Confronted with a request for settlement-only  [**48] class certification, a district court need not 
inquire whether the case, if tried, would present intractable management problems, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3)(D), 
for the proposal is that there be no trial."" Amchem, 521 U.S. at 620.
In considering the other relevant factors, the Court finds that the Class, and Subclasses, satisfy the superiority 
requirements of Rule 23(b)(3). Here, there is a potentially large number of class members—perhaps numbering 
over 13,000—who as a whole are geographically widely disbursed. See Pls.' Mem. of Law on Prelim. Approval of 
Sparboe Settlement at 20. These factors represent a potentially crushing strain on and inefficient application of 
judicial resources if the putative class members' claims were prosecuted individually. Furthermore, when ""each 
consumer has a very small claim in relation to the cost of prosecuting a lawsuit. . . , a class action facilitates 
spreading of the litigation costs among the numerous injured parties and encourages private enforcement of the 
statutes."" Warfarin, 391 F.3d at 534. Under the present circumstances, a class action device enables individual 
direct purchasers to pursue their claims in an economically feasible manner,  [**49] with greater efficacy in 
achieving enforcement and deterrence goals, and with greater bargaining power for settlement purposes. 15
Putative Class Members were free to opt out of the settlement to pursue their own claims individually if they so 
chose, and some of the direct purchasers who opted out of the Sparboe Settlement, namely, Direct Action Plaintiffs, 
indeed have filed individual actions that name Sparboe as a defendant and that have been consolidated or 
coordinated in this multi-district litigation. Another case brought by opt-out parties against Sparboe for its alleged 
conduct  [**51] is pending in Kansas state court as a result of a ruling of this Court. See Dec. 19, 2011 Mem., 2011 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 146258, 2011 WL 6396462 (Doc. No. 601). That there are only six pending Direct Action Plaintiff 
suits and one state court suit pending against Sparboe based upon its alleged antitrust conduct suggests that few 
Class Members have significant individual claims, or interest in bringing their claims separately, and that there is a 
lack of interest in the individual prosecution of claims among Class Members on the whole. See id.
For these reasons, a class action resolution in the manner proposed in the Sparboe Settlement would be superior 
to other available methods for a fair and efficient adjudication of the case against Sparboe.
15 For these same reasons, to the extent that consideration of Rule 23(b)(3)(C) is pertinent here, and, for now, without regard to 
the remand mechanisms for an MDL action, it would be preferable to adjudicate these claims in one judicial proceeding and in 
one forum as a class action. See Amalgamated Workers Union of Virgin Islands v. Hess Oil Virgin Islands Corp., 478 F.2d 540, 
543, 10 V.I. 575 (3d Cir. 1973) (""The 'superiority requirement' was intended to refer to the preferability of adjudicating claims of 
multiple-parties in one judicial proceeding and in one forum, rather than forcing each plaintiff to proceed by separate suit, and 
possibly requiring a defendant to answer suits growing out of one incident in geographically separated courts.""). See generally 
Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) note (1966) (""Also pertinent is the question of the desirability of concentrating the trial of the claims in the 
particular forum by means of a class action, in contrast to allowing the claims to be litigated separately in forums to which they 
would ordinarily be brought.""). However, as  [**50] one commentator has discussed, in light of 28 U.S.C. § 1407, as a general 
matter, ""[t]his factor should . . . be of little or no significance in resolving the superiority issue."" Newberg, supra, §4:31. Indeed, 
this factor appears to have limited bearing under the present circumstances because the United States Judicial Panel on 
Multidistrict Litigation previously considered, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1407, the desirability of centralizing the various initially-filed 
direct purchaser class action suits in this particular forum, see In re Processed Egg Prods. Antitrust Litig., 588 F. Supp. 2d 1366, 
1367 (J.P.M.L. 2008), and a consolidated class action complaint was filed which superseded all previously-filed direct purchaser 
complaints.

3. Conclusion as to Class Certification for Settlement Purposes
Because the Court concludes that all of the Rule 23(a) and (b)(3) requirements have  [*295] been met, the Court 
certifies the Class, and Subclasses, as defined above for settlement purposes.
B. Notice
""In the class action context, the district court obtains personal jurisdiction over the absentee class members by 
providing proper notice of the impending class action and providing the absentees with the opportunity to be heard 
 [**52] or the opportunity to exclude themselves from the class."" Prudential, 148 F.3d at 306. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 sets 
forth two provisions concerning notice to class members.
First, Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(2)(B) requires that class members be given the best notice practicable under the 
circumstances, including individual notice to all potential class members identifiable through reasonable effort. This 
notice is to be given to all potential members of a Rule 23(b)(3) class. Prudential, 148 F.3d at 326. Specifically, the 
Rule provides that such notice
must clearly and concisely state in plain, easily understood language: (i) the nature of the action; (ii) the 
definition of the class certified; (iii) the class claims, issues, or defenses; (iv) that a class member may enter an 
appearance through an attorney if the member so desires; (v) that the court will exclude from the class any 
member who requests exclusion; (vi) the time and manner for requesting exclusion; and (vii) the binding effect 
of a class judgment on members under Rule 23(c)(3).
Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(2)(B).
Second, Rule 23(e) requires all members of the class be notified of the terms of any proposed settlement. Fed. R. 
Civ. P. 23(e).  [**53] This ""notice is designed to summarize the litigation and the settlement"" and ""to apprise class 
members of the right and opportunity to inspect the complete settlement documents, papers, and pleadings filed in 
the litigation."" Prudential, 148 F.3d at 327 (quoting 2 Newberg, supra, § 8.32 at 8-109).
Here, the Notice of the Sparboe Settlement contained the information required by Rules 23(c)(2) and 23(e). The 
Notice appropriately detailed the nature of the action, the Class claims, the definition of the Class and Subclasses, 
16 the terms of the proposed settlement agreement, and the class members' right to object or request exclusion 
from the settlement and the timing and manner for doing so. The Notice also informed Class Members of their 
opportunity to be heard at the fairness hearing and to enter an appearance through an attorney, and stated that the 
settlement would be binding on Class Members who did not opt out of it.
Furthermore, the extent of the Plaintiffs' efforts to notify potential Class Members is adequate. The Notice was 
mailed to potential Class Members individually based upon consumer information provided by Sparboe and the 
other Defendants. See Larson v. AT&T Mobility LLC, No. 10-1285, 687 F.3d 109, 2012 U.S. App. LEXIS 13292, 
2012 WL 2478376, at *9 (3d Cir. June 29, 2012) (recognizing that ""'individual notice to identifiable class members is 
not a discretionary consideration to be waived in a particular case. It is, rather, an unambiguous requirement of 
Rule 23. . . . Accordingly, each class member who can be identified through reasonable effort must be notified.'"" 
16 As discussed earlier, the Notice of the Sparboe Settlement appears to contain an inadvertent typo as to the end date for the 
Class Period. However, because the actual Class Period was set forth in the Settlement Agreement, which was made available 
for the putative  [**54] Class Members' examination, and because the Notice as disseminated defined the Class broader, rather 
than narrower, than the actual Class definition, the Court does not find the oversight sufficient to have prevented putative class 
members from failing to understand the Settlement Agreement terms or prevent them from opportunity to opt out or object to the 
Agreement. It follows that the Court does not find that the existence of this typo requires additional notice to new class members 
as to the Class Period.
284 F.R.D. 278, *294; 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98302, **50

 
(quoting Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U.S. 156, 176, 94 S. Ct. 2140, 40 L. Ed. 2d 732 (1974))).  [**55] In 
addition, the parties published a notice of the settlement on the same day in several appropriate publications, and 
distributed a press release concerning the Sparboe Settlement to approximately 1,000 journalists in the restaurant 
and food industries, which resulted in some 335 articles that reported on both the Sparboe and Moark Settlements. 
See Zimmer Paper Prods., Inc. v. Berger & Montague, P.C., 758 F.2d 86, 90 (3d Cir. 1985)  [*296] (""It is well 
settled that in the usual situation first-class mail and publication in the press fully satisfy the notice requirement of 
both Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 and the due process clause."").
Accordingly, the Court determines that the notice provided to the putative Class Members constitutes adequate 
notice in satisfaction of the demands of Rule 23.
C. Fair, Reasonable, and Adequate
To grant final approval, the Court must conclude that the proposed settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate. Ins. 
Brokerage, 579 F.3d at 258; Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(2). Trial courts generally are afforded broad discretion in 
determining whether to approve a proposed class action settlement. Eichenholtz v. Brennan, 52 F.3d 478, 482 (3d 
Cir. 1995). 17
Although no opposition has been filed to the Motion and no objectors have contested the settlement, pursuant to 
Rule 23(e), the Court has the duty of protecting absentee class members, and the Court executes this duty by 
independently ""assuring the settlement represents adequate compensation for the release of the class claims."" 
Prudential, 148 F.3d at 316-17. 18 Indeed, certain requirements of Rule 23 ""demand undiluted, even heightened, 
attention in the settlement context."" Amchem, 521 U.S. at 620. Cognizant of this duty, the Court evaluates the 
fairness, reasonableness, and adequacy of the Sparboe Settlement as follows.
17 The Third Circuit Court of  [**56] Appeals recognizes that ""[g]reat weight is accorded [the] views [of the trial judge] because he 
is exposed to the litigants, and their strategies, positions and proofs. He is aware of the expense and possible legal bars to 
success. Simply stated, he is on the firing line and can evaluate the action accordingly."" Walsh v. Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea 
Co., Inc., 726 F.2d 956, 965 (3d Cir. 1983) (quoting Ace Heating & Plumbing Co. v. Crane Co., 453 F.2d 30, 34 (3d Cir. 1971)).
18 The Manual for Complex Litigation observes that the ""task is demanding because the adversariness  [**57] of litigation is often 
lost after the agreement to settle."" David F. Herr, The Manual for Complex Litigation § 21.61, at 487 (4th ed. 2011). Indeed, the 
observation that ""'[c]ourts applying [a multifactor] test [ ] often recite the litany and engage in pro forma analyses, but their hearts 
are not in it,'"" could be an equally a propos statement for those parties advancing unopposed motions for final settlement 
approval. Ehrheart v. Verizon Wireless, 609 F.3d 590, 605 n.10 (3d Cir. 2010) (dissenting, Smith, J.) (quoting Jonathan R. 
Macey & Geoffrey P. Miller, Judicial Review of Class Action Settlements, 1 J. of Legal Analysis 167, 172 (2009)).
Here, there is an absence of any objectors or any adversarial challenge to the Motion at bar, which appears to account for the 
dearth of any arguments criticizing, exposing, or meaningfully addressing possible flaws or drawbacks to the settlement 
agreement appearing in the record. Nonetheless, the Court recognizes that although the final settlement approval process may 
have lacked an edgy or adversarial demeanor, this does not necessarily bear on whether the settlement negotiation process was 
adversarial and resulted in a fair, reasonable, and adequate  [**58] settlement. This is because the focus here is on the 
settlement agreement, and ""[w]hether or not there are objectors or opponents to the proposed settlement, the court must make 
an independent analysis of the settlement terms."" Herr, supra, at 488. Furthermore, the Court notes that, in response to the 
Court's inquiries for additional facts and development of the record, Interim Co-Lead Counsel fully and appropriately cooperated 
in the Court's efforts to consider and analyze the proposed settlement.
Nonetheless, in the event that any other partial or complete settlements are reached in the future of this case, or in this multi-
district litigation generally, all parties' counsel are well-advised, again, to continue to be responsive and attentive to the Court's 
inquiries as to settlement agreements during the various approval processes, and also to anticipate and be cognizant of what 
appropriate, specific information the Court needs—particularly in light of recent case law developments—in order to perform the 
fact intensive inquiry required for executing its duty to protect absentee class members. After all, the burden lies with the 
movants to demonstrate that the settlement is fair, reasonable,  [**59] and adequate.
284 F.R.D. 278, *295; 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98302, **54

 
1. Initial Presumption of Fairness
Based upon the record, the Court concludes that an initial presumption of fairness attaches to the Settlement. The 
Third Circuit Court of Appeals has ""directed a district court to apply an initial presumption of fairness when 
reviewing a proposed settlement where: '(1) the settlement negotiations occurred at arm's length; (2) there was 
sufficient discovery; (3) the proponents of the settlement are experienced in similar litigation; and (4) only a small 
fraction of the class objected.'"" Warfarin, 391 F.3d at 535 (citing  [*297] In re Cendant Corp. Litig., 264 F.3d 201, 
232 n.18 (3d Cir. 2001)).
These criteria have been met here. The proposed class settlement was negotiated at arm's length over the course 
of four months by the Plaintiffs' Interim Co-Lead Counsel and Sparboe's counsel. As further discussed, infra, 
although no formal discovery was conducted in this case during the time of the Sparboe Settlement negotiations or 
agreement, Plaintiffs' Interim Co-Lead Counsel conducted informal discovery, including, inter alia, independently 
investigating the merits prior to filing the complaint, which enabled counsel to have sufficient background in 
 [**60] the facts of the case, including Sparboe's alleged role in it. As previously discussed, Interim Co-Lead 
Counsel are extremely experienced in class action litigation, and specifically, similar antitrust litigation. Furthermore, 
no member of the purported class objected to the settlement.
Given that the Court finds that the four factors are sufficiently met, the presumption of fairness applies to the 
settlement.
2. Standards for Determining Fairness of Proposed Settlement
The Third Circuit Court of Appeals has set forth nine factors, known as the Girsh factors, to be considered when 
determining the fairness of a proposed settlement:
(1) the complexity, expense and likely duration of the litigation; (2) the reaction of the class to the settlement; 
(3) the stage of the proceedings and the amount of discovery completed; (4) the risks of establishing liability; 
(5) the risks of establishing damages; (6) the risks of maintaining the class action through trial; (7) the ability of 
the defendants to withstand a greater judgment; (8) the range of reasonableness of the settlement fund in light 
of the best possible recovery; (9) the range of reasonableness of the settlement fund to a possible recovery 
 [**61] in light of all the attendant risks of litigation . . . .
Girsh, 521 F.2d at 157 (internal quotations and punctuation marks omitted); Prudential, 148 F.3d at 317. ""The 
settling parties bear the burden of providing that the Girsh factors weigh in favor of approval of the settlement."" Pet 
Food, 629 F.3d at 350 (citing In re General Motors Corp. PickUp Truck Fuel Tank Prods. Liab. Litig., 55 F.3d 768, 
785 (3d Cir. 1995)).
In In re Prudential Insurance Company of America Sales Practice Litigation Agent Actions, the Third Circuit Court of 
Appeals also identified additional non-exclusive factors for courts to consider for a ""thoroughgoing analysis of a 
settlement's terms."" See Pet Food, 629 F.3d at 350. Those factors, known as the Prudential factors, include:
[T]he maturity of the underlying substantive issues, as measured by experience in adjudicating individual 
actions, the development of scientific knowledge, the extent of discovery on the merits, and other factors that 
bear on the ability to assess the probable outcome of a trial on the merits of liability and individual damages; 
the existence and probable outcome of claims by other classes and subclasses; the comparison between the 
results  [**62] achieved by the settlement for individual class or subclass members and the results achieved—
or likely to be achieved—for other claimants; whether class or subclass members are accorded the right to opt 
out of the settlement; whether any provision for attorneys' fees are reasonable; and whether the procedure for 
processing individual claims under the settlement is fair and reasonable.
284 F.R.D. 278, *296; 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98302, **59

 
See Prudential, 148 F.3d at 323. 19 While the Court must make findings as to the Girsh factors to approve a 
settlement as fair, reasonable, and adequate, the Prudential factors are illustrative of additional factors that may be 
useful even though they are not essential or inexorable depending upon the specific circumstances.
Although there is an overriding public interest in settling class actions, district courts should apply ""an even more 
rigorous, heightened standard in cases where settlement negotiations precede class certification, and approval for 
settlement and class certification  [*298] are sought simultaneously."" Pet Food, 629 F.3d at 350  [**63] (internal 
quotations omitted). ""This heightened standard is designed to ensure that class counsel has demonstrated 
'sustained advocacy' throughout the course of the proceedings and has protected the interests of all class 
members."" Prudential, 148 F.3d at 317.
Thus, the Court is required to make an independent analysis of the settlement to determine whether it is fair, 
reasonable, and adequate by independently evaluating all of the Girsh factors (and the Prudential factors, as 
appropriate), recognizing that the Court cannot substitute the parties' assurances or conclusory statements for its 
independent analysis of the settlement terms. Pet Food, 629 F.3d at 351. Accordingly, the Court ""may find it 
necessary to drill down into the case and into the agreement to make an independent 'scrupulous' analysis of the 
settlement terms"" and affirmatively seek out information to the extent that the parties have either not supplied it or 
have provided only conclusory statements. See id.
3. Discussion of Girsh and Prudential Factors
The Court's analysis of the Girsh factors, and the Prudential factors, as appropriate, leads to the conclusion that the 
relevant considerations weigh in favor of a finding  [**64] of fairness under Rule 23(e).
a. The Complexity, Expense and Likely Duration of the Litigation
The first Girsh factor, which evaluates the complexity, expenses and likely duration of the litigation, ""captures the 
probable costs, in both time and money, of continued litigation."" Warfarin, 391 F.3d at 535-36 (citation omitted). At 
the outset, the Court appreciates that antitrust suits, like this one, are often complex actions to prosecute. See In re 
Linerboard Antitrust Litig., 292 F. Supp. 2d 631, 639 (E.D. Pa. 2003). Furthermore, given that the settlement 
agreement occurred at an early stage of this litigation, prior to the active commencement of discovery, Plaintiffs 
have avoided such expense and delay as may have attached to these settling Defendants. See Bell Atl. Corp. v. 
Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 558-59, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007) (recognizing that ""antitrust discovery 
can be expensive""). Discovery in this case against Sparboe would entail—which would demand reasonably the 
same and similar discovery that will occur as to the remaining Defendants in this suit—considerable expenditures of 
financial resources and hours of attorney time relating to discovery for liability and damages, including extensive 
electronic  [**65] discovery and scores of witness depositions, experts, class certification, further pre-trial motions, 
and potentially a trial on the merits. The Court determines that such an undertaking ""would not only further prolong 
the litigation but also reduce the value of any recovery to the class."" Warfarin, 391 F.3d at 536. Accordingly, this 
factor weighs in favor of the Sparboe Settlement.
b. The Reaction of the Class to the Settlement
""In an effort to measure the class's own reaction to the settlement's terms directly, courts look to the number and 
vociferousness of the objectors."" Gen. Motors, 55 F.3d at 812. Considering this factor from a somewhat different 
angle, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals has recognized the practical conclusion that it is generally appropriate to 
19 The Court of Appeals invites individualized analysis by noting that ""[o]ther related factors . . . also may be relevant to this 
inquiry."" Prudential, 148 F. 3d at 323 n.73.
284 F.R.D. 278, *297; 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98302, **62

 
assume that ""silence constitutes tacit consent to the agreement"" in the class settlement context. See Bell Atlantic 
Corp. v. Bolger, 2 F.3d 1304, 1313 n.15 (3d Cir. 1993). By using these considerations as a gauge of class reaction 
to the Sparboe Settlement, the Court determines that the class reaction here favors settlement. Indeed, there were 
no objections filed to the Settlement and thus no negative feedback to the settlement.  [**66] Moreover, as Interim 
Co-Lead Counsel has represented, many of the Class Members are sophisticated entities with their own in-house 
counsel, and ostensibly have the resources and ability to assess the settlement agreement beyond the average 
layperson or enterprise.
Moreover, there were only 364 requests for exclusion from the Class, which is 2.76% of the Notice addressees, or 
virtually di minimis in light of the over 13,200 Notices of  [*299] settlement that were sent (as well as published 
notices and press releases about the settlement). Furthermore, many of the 364 requests for exclusion come from 
entities or subsidiaries organizationally related to other opt-out filers, and so the Court understands that the number 
of distinct, independent parties who have excluded themselves likely is less than 364 in number. Keogh Aff. ¶ 17. 
As such, this factor weighs in favor of the proposed settlement's fairness and adequacy. See Cendant Corp., 264 
F.3d at 234-35 (recognizing that low number of objectors and opt-outs strongly favors settlement and that ""[t]he vast 
disparity between the number of potential class members who received notice of the Settlement and the number of 
objectors creates a strong  [**67] presumption that this factor weighs in favor of the Settlement"").
c. The Stage of the Proceedings and the Amount of Discovery Completed
This Girsh factor requires the Court to evaluate whether Plaintiffs had an ""adequate appreciation of the merits of the 
case before negotiating"" settlement. Prudential, 148 F.3d at 319 (quoting Gen. Motors, 55 F.3d at 813). ""To ensure 
that a proposed settlement is the product of informed negotiations, there should be an inquiry into the type and 
amount of discovery the parties have undertaken."" Id. The Third Circuit Court of Appeals has recognized that, even 
if a settlement occurs in an early stage of litigation, there are means for class counsel to apprise themselves of the 
merits of the litigation, such as ""conduct[ing] significant independent discovery or investigations to develop the 
merits of their case (as opposed to supporting the value of the settlement)"" or retaining their own experts or 
interviewing witnesses. See Gen. Motors, 55 F.3d at 814.
Here, the Court is satisfied that Interim Co-Lead Counsel had adequate knowledge of the litigation and informed 
negotiations. Interim Co-Lead Counsel has represented to the Court that they ""conducted extensive 
 [**68] investigations into the case in preparation for filing of the complaint."" Mot. at 17-18; see also Mot., Ex. A, 
Hausfeld Decl. ¶ 5 (""Plaintiffs entered the negotiations with Sparboe with a significant amount of knowledge of 
Defendants' antitrust conspiracy, as a result of months of investigations into the conspiracy conducted by the 
numerous experienced law firms representing them.""); Asher Decl. ¶ 6 (recounting that the counsel's investigations 
included research into the egg industry, egg trade associations, such as United Egg Producer (""UEP""), UEP's 
animal welfare programs, the economics underlying the alleged conspiracy, and the legal issues relating to the 
conspiracy). See Prudential, 148 F.3d at 319 (recognizing that informal discovery methods can support adequate 
appreciation of the merits).
Several Defendants filed motions to dismiss the Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint in the midst of the 
negotiations for the Sparboe Settlement. Indeed, the Court granted Sparboe an extension of the deadline to 
respond to that very pleading. See Order (Doc. No. 98) (granting Defendant Sparboe Farms, Inc.'s Motion to 
Extend Defendant Sparboe's Time to Respond to Direct Purchasers' Consolidated  [**69] Amended Class Action 
Complaint and to Extend Subsequent Deadlines (Docket No. 90)). These motions provided Interim Co-Lead 
Counsel with an additional platform from which to ascertain Sparboe's and the other Defendants' positions on the 
case and thereby to evaluate further the merits of the litigation.
As a result, the Court is satisfied that Interim Co-Lead Counsel, as highly experienced antitrust litigators, were in 
such a position prior to negotiating and entering into the Sparboe Settlement that they had an adequate 
understanding and appreciation of strengths and weaknesses of the Plaintiffs' case. Accordingly, the Court 
determines this factor weighs in favor of settlement.
284 F.R.D. 278, *298; 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98302, **65

 
d. Risks of Establishing Liability, Damages, and Maintaining the Class Action Through Trial
These three Girsh factors concern the risks of establishing liability, damages, and maintaining a class action 
through trial. The factors require the Court to ""survey the potential risks and rewards of proceeding to litigation in 
order to weigh the likelihood of success against the benefits of an immediate  [*300] settlement."" Warfarin, 391 F.3d 
at 537. The inquiry requires balancing ""the likelihood of success and the potential damage  [**70] award if the case 
were taken to trial against the benefits of immediate settlement."" Prudential, 148 F.3d at 319. For example, the 
Court assesses the risks of establishing liability to ""examine what the potential rewards (or downside) of litigation 
might have been had class counsel decided to litigate the claims rather than settle them."" Gen. Motors, 55 F.3d at 
814. As another example, the inquiry into establishing damages ""attempts to measure the expected value of 
litigating the action rather than settling it at the current time."" Id. at 816.
In cases of settlements with only a subset of defendants to the suit, as is the case here:
[g]iven that the litigation might continue against other defendants, the parties may be reluctant to disclose fully 
and candidly their assessment of the proposed settlement's strengths and weaknesses that led them to settle 
separately. The adequacy of the settlement depends in part on the relative exposure and resources of other 
parties. An informed evaluation is extremely difficult if discovery is incomplete or has been conducted against 
only a few of the defendants.
Herr, supra, § 21.651, at 505. Thus, the Court understands why Plaintiffs decline to provide  [**71] a detailed 
assessment of any risks perceived in establishing liability and damages, and instead emphasize that the Court 
should consider Interim Co-Lead Counsel's estimation of the probability of success in assessing these factors. See 
Mot. at 18-19 & n.5. Indeed, the Court gives credence to counsel's representation that although ""they believe 
[Plaintiffs] will prevail at trial, they recognize that antitrust cases, like all complex litigation against large companies 
with highly talented defense counsel, have inherent risks."" Id. at 19. The record demonstrates that counsel have 
significant experience in antitrust cases such as this one which ought to enable them to appreciate the strengths 
and weakness of the case and the risks of maintaining the action through trial.
Furthermore, antitrust class action litigation is complex, and, especially at its early stages, inherently rife with risk 
and unpredictability in terms of ultimately prevailing to establish liability and damages and achieve class 
certification. The Court finds that this suit presents no exception. Indeed, this settlement was executed prior to the 
amendment of the Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint and the extensive  [**72] motion to dismiss 
practice that followed. At present, the bulk of discovery, dispositive motion practice, expert discovery, class 
certification, and trial are on the horizon of this case with the attendant expense and uncertainties. Thus, there is a 
genuine risk of not prevailing in establishing class certification, liability, or damages. As all experienced litigators 
and jurists know, that a jury will be the ultimate fact-finder at trial presents further risks and uncertainties.
The motion practice that has already transpired is indicative of the future risk that Plaintiffs face in prosecuting their 
case against Sparboe. Plaintiffs have already engaged with several of the other Defendants in extensive motion 
practice concerning the Second Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint. The Plaintiffs' pending motion for 
leave to file a Third Consolidated Amended Class Action has been challenged in part by one group of defendants 
as to the claims against them individually. Moreover, Sparboe itself has filed motions to dismiss the six complaints 
brought by Direct Action Plaintiffs as to the individual claims against it. See Docket Nos. 635-637, 639-643, and 
645.
Based on the detailed allegations  [**73] in the Second Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint, Plaintiffs 
appear to have evidence to support their theory that Defendants conspired to reduce the supply of eggs and egg 
products, and thereby increase prices. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(b) (concerning representations to the Court in 
pleadings). Nonetheless, even assuming Plaintiffs could establish their theory of an overarching conspiracy at trial, 
their success in establishing liability and damages as to individual defendants, such as Sparboe, is by no means 
assured.
284 F.R.D. 278, *299; 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98302, **69

 
Through the Sparboe Settlement, Plaintiffs may have secured cooperation in prosecuting their case, which, 
according to Interim Co-Lead Counsel, ""significantly reduces the  [*301] risks associated with discovery."" See Mot. 
at 20. Nonetheless, such cooperation is no guarantee to success in proving liability and damages in this complex 
litigation, and Plaintiffs still must show that Defendants individually agreed to join the alleged conspiracy. Indeed, 
the other Defendants' individual motions to dismiss raised issues concerning whether they individually actually 
joined the conspiracy. Furthermore, Defendants jointly challenged at the motion to dismiss stage whether Plaintiffs 
 [**74] could recover damages outside the statute of limitations. These issues remain live subjects for discovery and 
additional dispositive motion practice, and any trial on these issues would be protracted and involve a significant 
amount of testimony and documentary evidence, particularly given the time period at issue, which spans almost a 
decade, and the number of parties involved.
In addition to challenging the Plaintiffs' complaints, Defendants also have demonstrated an intent to vigorously 
defend against this suit—including by raising privilege issues relating to the Sparboe Settlement, see, e.g., Order 
(Doc. No. 361); Order (Doc. No. 403), and other discovery-related issues, see, e.g., Conf. Tr. (Doc. No. 591); Conf. 
Tr. (Doc. No. 675); Case Mgmt Order Nos. 16 to 19 (Doc. Nos. 604, 626, 656, and 676). Furthermore, Defendants 
have indicated during the course of these proceedings, particularly during the development of a discovery plan, that 
they intend to advance defenses, such as an agricultural cooperative immunity defense under the Capper-Volstead 
Act and a defense involving standard-setting conduct, that will present difficult factual and legal issues for the 
parties, creating their  [**75] own brand and quantity of uncertainty for the Plaintiffs' case. See, e.g., Case Mgmt 
Order No. 19. The parties also contemplate expert discovery on damages, which likely will result in competing 
expert opinions representing very different damage estimates that will present further ambiguity as to resolution on 
damages as to each Defendant. See, e.g., Conf. Tr. (Doc. No. 675).
It is entirely likely that Plaintiffs would face similar, if not identical, legal challenges and uncertainties in their claims 
again Sparboe. Indeed, as mentioned above, Sparboe has filed motions to dismiss the individual claims asserted 
against it in the six Direct Action Plaintiffs' complaints, and has joined the Defendants' joint motion to dismiss the 
Direct Action Plaintiffs' complaints for recovery of damages outside the statute of limitations period.
Finally, Plaintiffs not only face the risk that they will not succeed in establishing liability and damages, but also the 
risks associated with certifying and maintain a class. See Warfarin, 391 F. 3d at 537. Indeed ""'the prospects for 
obtaining certification have a great impact on the range of recovery one can expect to reap from the [class] action.'"" 
Id. (quoting  [**76] Gen. Motors, 55 F.3d at 817). ""The value of a class action depends largely on the certification of 
the class because, not only does the aggregation of the claims enlarge the value of the suit, but often the 
combination of the individual cases also pools litigation resources and may facilitate proof on the merits."" Gen. 
Motors, 55 F.3d at 817. Thus, this Girsh ""factor measures the likelihood of obtaining and keeping a class 
certification if the action were to proceed to trial,"" recognizing that a ""district court retains the authority to decertify or 
modify a class at any time during the litigation if it proves to be unmanageable."" Warfarin, 391 F.3d at 537 (citing 
Prudential, 148 F.3d at 321).
Many, if not all, Defendants no doubt will vigorously oppose class certification. If Sparboe remained in this litigation, 
in all likelihood it would join those defense efforts in this respect just as it has joined the joint defense in the suits 
brought by the Direct Action Plaintiffs. The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has recognized: ""There will always 
be a 'risk' or possibility of decertification, and consequently the court can always claim this factor weighs in favor of 
settlement."" Prudential, 148 F.3d at 321.  [**77] 20 Thus, there are inherent difficulties in bringing a class action to 
trial that apply here.
 [*302]  Because the Plaintiffs would face genuine risks and uncertainties in establishing liability and damages 
against Sparboe, and in obtaining and maintaining class certification, should the claims against Sparboe continue 
without settlement, these three factors weigh in favor of settlement.
20 Based on this observation, the Court of Appeals has questioned the significance of this factor in ""settlement-only"" class 
actions following the Supreme Court's decision in Amchem. See Prudential, 148 F.3d at 321.
284 F.R.D. 278, *300; 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98302, **73

 
e. The Ability of the Defendant to Withstand a Greater Judgment
This factor ""is concerned with whether the defendants could withstand a judgment for an amount significantly 
greater than the Settlement."" Cendant, 264 F.3d at 240. Thus, the Court must consider here whether Sparboe could 
withstand a judgment for an amount significantly greater than the costs associated with the proposed cooperation.
The limited evidence in the record suggests that Sparboe would be able to withstand a greater judgment, namely 
some sort of monetary payment. Indeed, in the Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint, Sparboe  [**78] is 
alleged to be the fifth largest shell egg marketer and producer in the United States. See Consol. Am. Class Action 
Compl. at ¶ 85. There is no evidence concerning the financial or other possible impacts a greater judgment amount 
would have on Sparboe. See, e.g., Cendant, 264 F.3d at 240-41 (discussing the possibility of bankruptcy for a 
settling defendant).
Furthermore, the Plaintiffs' arguments tacitly suggest that Sparboe could withstand a larger judgment. They argue 
that ""[t]his factor deserves little weight, especially in light of the risks of continued litigation against remaining 
Defendants without the cooperation obtained from Sparboe."" Mot. at 21.
Thus, the record suggests that Sparboe could pay monetary consideration as opposed to only providing the 
nonmonetary consideration set forth in the Settlement terms. Accordingly, this factor does not weigh in favor of 
approval.
f. The Range of Reasonableness of the Settlement in Light of the Best Possible Recovery and the Attendant Risks 
of Litigation
""The last two Girsh factors ask whether the settlement is reasonable in light of the best possible recovery and the 
risks the parties would face if the case went to trial."" Prudential, 148 F.3d at 322.  [**79] In other words, the Court 
evaluates ""whether the settlement represents a good value for a weak case or a poor value for a strong case. The 
factors test two sides of the same coin: reasonableness in light of the best possible recovery and reasonableness in 
light of the risks the parties would face if the case went to trial."" Warfarin, 391 F.3d at 538 (citing Prudential, 148 
F.3d at 322).
Here, the Court evaluates the settlement in light of its nonmonetary consideration—namely, Sparboe's cooperation 
in the prosecution of the Plaintiffs' case against the other remaining Defendants by providing documents and 
witness testimony. ""Settlements involving nonmonetary provisions for class members . . . deserve careful scrutiny 
to ensure that these provisions have actual value to the class,"" which can be accomplished through a Rule 23(e) 
analysis. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(h) note (2003). ""Despite the difficulties they pose to measurement, nonpecuniary 
benefits . . . may support a settlement."" Bolger, 2 F.3d at 1311. 21
As this settlement is structured, it is difficult to determine accurately the actual value of the proposed settlement. 
Nonetheless, the Court determines that Sparboe's conferral of the nonpecuniary benefits to class members that is 
proposed under the settlement is valuable consideration, and reasonable both in light of the best possible recovery 
against Sparboe and in light of the risks the parties would face if the case went to trial against Sparboe. Certainly, 
calculating the best possible recovery against Sparboe for the class in the aggregate is ""exceedingly speculative"" at 
this point in time given the  [*303] previously-discussed risks of establishing liability and damages associated with 
this complex litigation, even when considering that treble damages are technically available for recovery under the 
Plaintiffs' Sherman Act claim.
21 By contrast, ordinarily, ""[i]n order to assess the reasonableness of a proposed settlement seeking monetary relief, 'the present 
value of the damages plaintiffs would likely recover if  [**80] successful, appropriately discounted for the risk of not prevailing, 
should be compared with the amount of the proposed settlement.'"" Prudential, 148 F.3d at 322. (citing Gen. Motors, 55 F.3d at 
806).
284 F.R.D. 278, *302; 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98302, **77

 
According to Interim Co-Lead Counsel, in cooperating with Plaintiffs, Sparboe
guide[s] [Plaintiffs] through not only the nature of the industry and the market,  [**81] but as well the workings 
of the UEP and the relationship of all of the defendants to the UEP and to the market. They're able to tell us 
how the domestic market or with regard to the export market and how the supply in both markets effected price 
domestically. They will be able to tell us others who were of like mind with them that the program was an effort 
to control supply and increase price. They will be able to identify those entities-those persons for us or those 
companies as well as others within other portions of the market that would have testimony that would be 
beneficial to the class which we otherwise would not know clearly for quite some time into the litigation.
Prelim. Hr'g Tr. at 17:22-18:10. Furthermore, ""Sparboe produced documents from its in-house counsel that it may 
have otherwise withheld had Sparboe litigated this case."" Hausfeld Decl. ¶ 14. Indeed, ""[t]he information Sparboe 
disclosed to Plaintiffs-both in documents and witness interviews-in some instances included communications 
between Sparboe's officers and attorneys and UEP's officers and attorneys."" Oct. 19, 2011 Mem. Op., 278 F.R.D. 
112, 116 (Rice, J.) (Doc. No. 585).
At the same time, the Court recognizes  [**82] that Sparboe's agreement to cooperate with Plaintiffs throughout the 
course of pre-trial proceedings and trial is valuable consideration in light of the risks in proceeding with this suit 
against the remaining Defendants. 22
At the Court's hearing on preliminary approval of the settlement, Interim Co-Lead Counsel noted Sparboe did not 
have an interest in offering any monetary consideration even though there was a demand for such consideration. 
Counsel explained that this case's unique attributes create greater value for a defendant's cooperation: ""In a 
majority of antitrust cases who are on behalf of classes, there is either a government investigation that precedes the 
filing of the complaint or a government indictment or even a guilty plea. There is none of that here."" Prelim. Hr'g Tr. 
at 8:12-8:15.
Interim Co-Lead Counsel also noted that the pleading standards as set forth in Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 
U.S. 544, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929, and its progeny raise the value of cooperation in that the information 
provided by Sparboe  [**83] comes in advance of discovery. Id. at 9:17-9:25, 10:1-10:5. There is greater efficiency 
in the Plaintiffs proceeding with their case with Sparboe's cooperation then with monetary consideration from an 
early settlement. Obtaining such information also assists in ""lay[ing] out for [Plaintiffs,] with greater clarity and the 
force of having witnesses and documents[,] what this case is about[,] so that [Plaintiffs] can move it more 
expeditiously as opposed to going through a protracted process even on an expedited basis of discovery one 
defendant at a time with possible motion and practice in between."" Id. at 12:11-12:16.
Granted, the Court observes that much of Sparboe's information provided under the Settlement Agreement would 
otherwise be available eventually through discovery as required under the federal rules, if Sparboe remained in this 
suit. Nonetheless, Sparboe's cooperation reduces costs and time associated with formal discovery. Plaintiffs are 
saved expenses by avoiding motion practice to obtain documents and having more focused depositions on subjects 
relevant to the claims' merits. Id. at 13:24-25, 14:1-8. Moreover, the Sparboe Settlement likely has short-circuited at 
least  [**84] some of the expense and delay of future discovery by securing Sparboe's cooperation and removing 
the Sparboe forces from those who would contest or complicate Plaintiffs' discovery efforts. Plaintiffs also gain a 
clear tactical advantage in obtaining Sparboe's information through  [*304] non-traditional discovery mechanisms, 
including, by way of example, the advantage of having this information to formulate strategy in taking discovery 
from the remaining Defendants, specific tailoring the scope and focus of discovery.
Furthermore, the settlement prevents Plaintiffs from having to defend against Sparboe, which has indicated that it 
may raise defenses involving service of process, venue, and personal jurisdiction, and abandonment of the 
conspiracy. Id. at 15:8-12, 17:13-17. Interim Co-Lead Counsel also indicated that on average Plaintiffs could save 
on average $100,000 to $200,000 for each motion. Id. at 15:19-15:20.
22 The Court does not comment on whether the information and facts that Sparboe may provide would be established, or even 
admissible, at trial, based upon counsel's representations.
284 F.R.D. 278, *303; 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98302, **80

 
The Court recognizes that a nonpecuniary settlement presents certain concerns because it may merely be a means 
of expediting the receipt of attorneys fees, and thereby is of dubious value to the class members. Cf. Bolger, 2 F.3d 
at 1318 (""Although nonmonetary relief is adequate consideration  [**85] for settling a derivative or class action, the 
risks of concealment and collusion are not insignificant. Derivative actions may settle for cosmetic changes and no 
tangible relief to the corporation in exchange for large attorneys' fees.""); Gen. Motors, 55 F.3d at 778 (rejecting 
settlement where each class member would receive a $1,000 coupon towards a new truck but attorneys requested 
fees of $ 9.5 million). However, the Court determines that such a concern is not present here because the 
Settlement Agreement does not set forth provisions concerning the collection of attorneys' fees relating to the 
settlement, and Interim Co-Lead Counsel has represented they do not intend to seek fees resulting from this 
Settlement Agreement.
While the value of this cooperation is certainly of tangible value, it is not entirely without compare. Moark, too, has 
agreed to cooperate with Plaintiffs with information that purportedly pertains to a longer time period than Sparboe's 
information. See Second Consol. Am. Class Action Compl. ¶ 240 (alleging that ""Sparboe ended its participation in 
both the UEP Certified Program and exports made through USEM that reduced domestic egg supply"" sometime 
shortly after  [**86] July 2003). Second, Sparboe's cooperation does not appear to assure that Plaintiffs will have 
conclusive evidence in support of their claims against the remaining Defendants. Indeed, Sparboe is a named 
Defendant in other cases in this litigation for the Direct Action Plaintiffs, and the Sparboe Settlement does not 
impact those plaintiffs' claims against which Sparboe must continue to defend.
Nonetheless, when considering these two Girsh factors in light of the record in toto, the Court is persuaded that 
Sparboe's cooperation confers real and substantial benefits upon the Class. The Court further concludes that the 
settlement is reasonable in light of the best possible recovery and the risks the parties would face if the case went 
to trial against Sparboe. These factors weigh in favor of approval of the settlement.
g. Prudential Factors
The relevant Prudential factors weigh in favor of approving the Sparboe Settlement, or, at worst, are neutral factors. 
First, the Court has already addressed the impact that the limited extent of discovery on the merits thus far has on 
this litigation and other factors that bear on the ability to assess the probable outcome of a trial on the merits of 
liability  [**87] and individual damages.
Second, the settlement agreement allows putative class members the right to opt out of the settlement. Indeed, 
some parties exercised this right by filing requests for exclusion. Furthermore, the Notice Packet included both a 
Notice of the Sparboe Settlement and a Notice of the Moark Settlement, thereby simultaneously notified class 
members of the Moark Settlement and enabling class members to assess the adequacy of the two settlements in 
conjunction with one another and as to the whole suit.
Third, the results achieved by the settlement for the Class and Subclasses are immediate, concrete, and realized 
without the costs and delays associated with extensive discovery and other later stages of litigation. Sparboe's 
cooperation pursuant to the settlement aids the Plaintiffs in prosecuting and resolving their claims against the other 
Defendants. Indeed, Interim Co-Lead Counsel  [*305] describe the Sparboe Settlement as an ""ice-breaker"" 
settlement, which is a term used to describe ""the first settlement in the litigation—and [a settlement that] should 
increase the likelihood of future settlements."" Linerboard, 292 F. Supp. 2d at 643. By contrast, it is unclear, given 
the aforementioned  [**88] risks and uncertainties, supra, whether Direct Action Plaintiffs who are individually 
prosecuting their claims apart from the Class, or other parties who opted-out of the Sparboe Settlement, will be 
successful in their claims against Moark and the other Defendants, and whether that result will be immeasurably 
better than the result for class members under the settlement agreement and as to the entire suit. For the same 
reasons, it is unclear whether those opt-out parties might achieve better settlements than the class to resolve 
similar claims against Sparboe.
Fourth, the Sparboe Settlement only releases Class Members' claims against Sparboe for claims arising out of 
injuries or damages that occurred ""from the beginning of time to the date of th[e] Agreement"" and that resulted from 
284 F.R.D. 278, *304; 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98302, **84

 
the conduct asserted in the Plaintiffs' suit. As such, future claims for injuries or damages against Sparboe arising 
outside this time period but resulting from the alleged conduct giving rise to the class claims are not barred. 
Moreover, the Release does not apply to those parties who opted-out of the Sparboe Settlement, such as Direct 
Action Plaintiffs.
Fifth, all segments of the class are being treated  [**89] equally relative to the consideration under the Sparboe 
Settlement. Sparboe is conferring its cooperation upon all class members. There is no differentiation among class 
members in terms of Subclasses or class representatives in terms of the information received.
h. Summary of Girsh and Prudential Factors
Upon considering the Sparboe Settlement Agreement in light of all of the Girsh and the relevant Prudential factors, 
the Court is satisfied that the settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate. As discussed, a few of the factors are 
neutral or weigh against settlement approval. However, all of the factors considered in determining the fairness of a 
settlement ""are a guide; an unfavorable conclusion regarding one or more factors does not automatically render the 
settlement unfair."" 2 Joseph M. McLaughlin, McLaughlin on Class Actions: Law and Practice § 6:8 (6th ed. 2010); 
see also Ehrheart, 609 F.3d at 605 (dissenting, Smith, J.) (quoting same). Accordingly, not every factor need weigh 
in favor of settlement in order for the settlement to be approved by the Court. See Cendant, 264 F. 3d at 242-43 
(affirming a final settlement approval when not all factors weighed in favor of approval).  [**90] Because, on 
balance, the factors as considered above weigh in favor of settlement, the Court concludes that approval of the 
settlement is appropriate pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e).
V. Conclusion
For the foregoing reasons, the Court determines that the Class and Subclasses meet the certification requirements 
of Rule 23 for settlement purposes, and concludes that the proposed settlement agreement is fair, reasonable, and 
adequate. Accordingly, the Court grants the Plaintiffs' motion for final approval of the class action settlement with 
Defendant Sparboe Farms, Inc.
An Order consistent with this Memorandum follows.
BY THE COURT:
/s/ Gene E.K. Pratter
GENE E.K. PRATTER
United States District Judge
ORDER GRANTING FINAL APPROVAL OF THE CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT BETWEEN DIRECT 
PURCHASER PLAINTIFFS AND DEFENDANT SPARBOE FARMS, INC.
AND NOW, this 16th day of July, 2012, upon consideration of the Motion for Final Approval of Settlement 
Agreement with Sparboe Farms, Inc. (Doc. No. 443), and following a final fairness hearing, in accordance with 
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, it is hereby ORDERED that the Motion (Doc. No. 443) is GRANTED  [**91] as 
outlined in this Order and the accompanying Memorandum.
Based on the Court's review of the proposed Settlement Agreement Between Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs and 
Sparboe Farms, Inc. (""Settlement Agreement""), and the entire record of this case, and having conducted a final 
fairness hearing on the matter, the Court determines as follows:
1. The Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of this action.
284 F.R.D. 278, *305; 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98302, **88

 
2. Terms used in this Order that are defined in the Settlement Agreement, unless otherwise defined herein, have 
the same meanings in this Order as in the Settlement Agreement.
3. The following Settlement Class, as defined in the Settlement Agreement, which was conditionally certified in the 
Court's Order granting preliminary approval of this settlement, is certified for settlement purposes only as follows 23:
All persons and entities that purchased eggs, including shell eggs and egg products, produced from caged 
birds in the United States directly from any producer during the Class Period from January 1, 2000 through the 
present.
a.) Shell Egg SubClass
All individuals and entities that purchased shell eggs produced from caged birds in the United States 
directly from any producer during the  [**92] Class Period from January 1, 2000 through the present.
b.) Egg Products SubClass
All individuals and entities that purchased egg products produced from shell eggs that came from caged 
birds in the United States directly from any producer during the Class Period from January 1, 2000 through 
the present.
Excluded from the class and subclasses are the Defendants, their co-conspirators, and their respective 
parents, subsidiaries and affiliates, all government entities, as well as the Court and staff to whom this case is 
assigned, and any member of the Court's or staff's immediate family. Also excluded from the Class and 
Subclasses are purchases of ""specialty"" shell egg or egg products (such as ""organic,"" ""freerange""or ""cage-
free"") and purchases of hatching eggs (used by poultry breeders to produce breeder stock or growing stock for 
laying hens or meat).
4. The Court finds, as discussed more thoroughly in the accompanying Memorandum, that the Settlement Class 
satisfies the applicable prerequisites for class action treatment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a) and (b). 
The Settlement Class is so numerous that joinder of all members is not practicable, there are questions of law and 
fact common to the Settlement Class, the claims of the Class Representatives are typical of the claims of the 
Settlement Class, and the Class Representatives will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Settlement 
Class. For purposes of this settlement, questions of law and fact common to the members of the Settlement Class 
predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and a class action is superior to other available 
methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.
5. Notice of the Settlement Agreement to the Settlement Class required by Rule 23(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil 
Procedure has been provided in accordance with the Court's Orders granting preliminary approval of this settlement 
and notice of this settlement, and such Notice has been given in an adequate and sufficient  [**94] manner; 
constitutes the best notice practicable under the circumstances; and satisfies Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 
23(c)(2)(B) and 23(e) and due process.
6. Defendants have filed notification of this settlement with the appropriate federal and state officials pursuant to the 
Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 (""CAFA""), 28 U.S.C. § 1715.
7. As discussed more thoroughly in the accompanying Memorandum, the Court finds that the Settlement 
Agreement is sufficiently fair, reasonable and adequate to the Settlement Class pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil 
Procedure 23(e). Specifically, the Court finds that the settlement meets the standard for an initial presumption of 
fairness. Additionally, the Court's analysis of the factors set forth in Girsh v. Jepson, 521 F.2d 153 (3d Cir. 1975), 
and factors set forth in In re Prudential Insurance Co. American Sales Practice Litigation Agent Actions, 148 F.3d 
23 ""Class Period"" is defined as ""the period from and including January 1, 2000 up to and including the date when Notice of the 
Court's entry of an order preliminarily approving this settlement and certifying a class for settlement purposes is first published."" 
Thus, the Class Period for the Settlement Agreement is from January 1, 2000 through  [**93] October 23, 2009.
284 F.R.D. 278, *305; 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98302, **91

 
283 (3d Cir. 1998), as appropriate, leads to the conclusion that the relevant considerations weigh in favor of finding 
the settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(e).
8. The Settlement Agreement is finally approved pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(e)  [**95] of the 
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure as fair, reasonable, and adequate, and the parties are directed to consummate the 
Settlement Agreement in accordance with its terms.
9. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania shall retain jurisdiction over the 
implementation, enforcement, and performance of this Settlement Agreement, and shall have exclusive jurisdiction 
over any suit, action, motion, proceeding, or dispute arising out of or relating to this Settlement Agreement or the 
applicability of this Agreement that cannot be resolved by negotiation and agreement by Plaintiffs and Sparboe 
Farms, Inc. This Settlement Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted according to the substantive laws of 
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania without regard to its choice of law or conflict of laws principles. Sparboe Farms, 
Inc. submits to the jurisdiction in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania only for the purposes of this Settlement 
Agreement and the implementation, enforcement and performance thereof. Sparboe Farms, Inc. otherwise retains 
all defenses to the Court's exercise of personal jurisdiction over Sparboe Farms, Inc..
