330,Judges,"Judges: J. Frederick Motz, United States District Judge."
330,Opinion by,Opinion by: J. Frederick Motz
342,Counsel,"Counsel:] Have you analyzed the aggregate of Microsoft's conduct that was directed against 
Novell's office productivity applications in order to ascertain whether that universe, that smaller universe, just 
conduct against Novell's office productivity applications, had some adverse impact on competition in the market 
for operating systems? . . .
[Dr. Noll:] Had Microsoft behaved differently to all other kinds of applications of middleware vendors than it 
behaved towards Novell. . . . But all the other producers of middleware and applications had -- they had dealt 
with them in a pro-competitive way -- and facilitated the development that -- of high-quality applications of 
middleware that were not produced by Microsoft that ran on the Windows platform, then -- then I suspect there 
would have been no adverse effect of knocking Novell out of the industry from the actions against Novell, but 
that's  [**71] - that's counter [f]actual.
(Dkt. No. 1947, Exh. 3 at 40-43.)
Even taking that answer into account, I conclude that Dr. Noll's proposed testimony raises a genuine issue of fact 
regarding whether the conduct directed at Novell was a significant contributor to anticompetitive harm in the PC 
operating system market. Novell has no obligation to create some ""hypothetical market place,"" in which none of the 
other ISVs or applications had been weakened by anticompetitive conduct, and then prove that the conduct at issue 
would still have significantly contributed to anticompetitive harm in that hypothetical market. Cf. Microsoft Corp., 253 
F.3d at 79. It would be contrary to the purpose of § 2 to immunize a monopolist for anticompetitive conduct, which in 
fact significantly contributed to anticompetitive harm, simply because that harm was caused by conduct directed at 
multiple small threats, none of which could prove that the conduct directed at any single firm would have by itself 
significantly  [**72] contributed to the defendant's monopoly if none of the other small firms had been similarly 
weakened. See supra note 18; Microsoft Corp., 253 F.3d at 79. 20 Rather,  [*750]  Novell need only prove that the 
conduct that harmed its software applications contributed significantly to Microsoft's monopoly in the PC operating 
system market considering all the characteristics of that market at the time, including the condition of other ISVs 
and applications.
19 (Dkt. No. 1952, Exh. 4 at 32 (Noll Expert Reply) (""I do not agree that Professor Murphy has proven that the acts against Novell 
alone had no effect on competition for the x86 operating systems . . . ."").)
20 (See also Dkt. No. 1952, Exh. 4 at 27 (Noll Expert Reply) (""In a 1000-firm market, the harm to any one competitor would not 
cause harm to competition, but that is irrelevant to ascertaining whether the entire pattern of conduct against all 1000 firms 
caused anticompetitive harm."").)
Microsoft seems to concede that, under some circumstances, the anticompetitive harm caused by a defendant's anticompetitive 
conduct toward multiple small competitors could be aggregated to reach a significant contribution finding in the relevant market. 
Microsoft distinguishes itself from such a hypothetical defendant, however, by asserting that its conduct toward Novell was 
fundamentally different than the anticompetitive conduct Microsoft directed against other ISVs  [**73] and applications. This 
argument is unpersuasive. I am not convinced that the conduct directed at the other ISVs is distinguishable in any material way 
from the conduct directed at Novell. Regardless, I do not think a defendant can avoid antitrust liability by engaging in ""different"" 
anticompetitive conduct toward each of its small competitors.
699 F. Supp. 2d 730, *749; 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 30756, **68

 
To be sure, Novell cannot piggy-back on the anticompetitive harm caused by conduct directed at third parties 
without actually showing the conduct which injured its applications had an anticompetitive impact as well. But Novell 
is not doing so. Despite Microsoft's assertions to the contrary, implicit in Dr. Noll's opinion is the conclusion that 
conduct directed at Novell, in and of itself, caused some anticompetitive harm in the PC operating system market. 
Dr. Noll's deposition statement that knocking Novell out of the market alone would have ""no adverse effect,"" when 
viewed in context, is properly understood as Dr. Noll agreeing that eliminating Novell's software applications from 
the market, on its own in some hypothetical market, would not have undermined Microsoft's monopoly position. 
Such a conclusion is not inconsistent with a finding that  [**74] Microsoft's actions toward Novell were a significant 
contributor to anticompetitive harm in the PC operating system market in light of the weakened state of other 
applications and ISVs. (Cf., e.g., Dkt. No. 1952, Exh. 3 at 9-11 (Noll Expert Decl.); id., Exh. 4 at 6-7, 28 (Noll Expert 
Reply).) A reasonable person may disagree with Dr. Noll, but the decision whether or not to do so is within the 
province of a jury.
Accordingly, but for Novell selling its claims under the APA, I would have denied Microsoft's Motion for Summary 
Judgment on Count I.
C.
I will now finally address Count VI. I find that, even if Novell had not assigned this claim, Microsoft would be entitled 
to summary judgment because the agreements at issue either were not exclusive, were not otherwise 
anticompetitive, or did not substantially foreclose competition in any market.
Count VI alleges that Microsoft violated § 1 of the Sherman Act 21 by entering into ""agreements with OEMs and 
others not to license or distribute Novell's office productivity applications or to do so only on terms that materially 
disadvantaged these products"" thereby ""unreasonably restrain[ing] trade by restricting the access of Novell's office 
productivity  [**75] applications to significant channels of distribution[.]"" (Compl. P 175.)
There is some indication that the parties believe that Count VI concerns only restraining trade in the software 
applications markets, not the operating system market. Both parties have briefed the  [*751]  issue as if the 
operating system market was irrelevant and Microsoft argues that I, in response to Microsoft's earlier motion to 
dismiss, tolled Count VI at least in part because it concerned agreements with OEMs (suggesting that Microsoft 
may believe that Count VI's tolling was unrelated to its connection to the operating system market).
If this is the parties' view of the matter, it is understandable in light of (i) Count VI's failure to mention the operating 
system market, (Compl. PP 174-77), (ii) my brief explanation as to why Count VI was tolled, In re Microsoft Corp. 
Antitrust Litig., 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11520, 2005 WL 1398643, at *1 (""Count VI is based upon Microsoft's 
exclusionary agreements with OEMs, which  [**76] allegedly were in [sic] unreasonable restraint of trade. Although 
Microsoft does not expressly concede the point, such agreements also were a subject of the government case. 
Thus, limitations has been tolled as to the claim asserted in Count VI.""), and (iii) the fact that § 1, in comparison with 
§ 2, is sometimes less focused on proving a particular anticompetitive impact in a particular market.
The Fourth Circuit, however, apparently believed that Count VI was tolled because Novell alleged unreasonable 
restraint of trade in the operating system market (though the court may not have actually reached the issue). 22 See 
Novell, 505 F.3d at 306-07. In contrast, the Fourth Circuit recognized that Counts II through V arose from 
allegations of anticompetitive impact in the software applications markets. Id. (""Because Counts II through V allege 
21 Section 1 HN20[
] reads in part: ""Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of 
trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal."" 15 U.S.C. § 1.
22 The Fourth Circuit explained: ""Counts I and VI . . . are predicated on the theory that Microsoft's conduct injured competition in 
the market for PC operating systems, a market in which Novell did not directly compete. . . . Section 5(i) of the Clayton Act 
provides that government anti-trust proceedings toll the statute of limitations for private antitrust actions 'based in whole or in part 
on any matter complained of' by the government. Novell's Counts I and VI are indeed based on Microsoft's anticompetitive 
conduct in the PC operating-systems market, which was at issue in the DOJ complaint."" See Novell, 505 F.3d at 306-07.
699 F. Supp. 2d 730, *750; 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 30756, **73

 
injury that is not specifically alleged in the DOJ complaint, Microsoft argued these claims were not tolled by the DOJ 
complaint and thus were time-barred. Microsoft sought dismissal of Novell's claims of injury to competition in the PC 
operating-systems market . . . in Counts I and VI on different grounds [antitrust standing and claim ownership]."") 
 [**77] If Novell could prevail on Count VI by proving merely substantial foreclosure in the software applications 
markets, without proving restraint of trade in the operating system market, Microsoft would have had a persuasive 
argument that Count VI was not ""based in whole or in part"" on the government case and thus should not have been 
tolled. Accordingly, I am of the view that Novell must prove that the agreements at issue in Count VI have 
unreasonably restrained trade in the operating system market. 23 
 [*752]  Novell has not even attempted to present evidence on this point. 24 Rather, Novell has briefed the issue as 
if it  [**79] only needed to prove restraint of trade--in this case, substantial foreclosure--in the software applications 
markets. In any event, although I believe Novell's failure to show restraint of trade in the operating system market 
dooms Count VI, because of the confusion surrounding this issue I will nonetheless evaluate whether Microsoft's 
conduct substantially foreclosed competition in the software applications markets. I find Novell has failed to meet its 
burden here as well.
a. Substantial Foreclosure Framework
Although Novell never expressly frames it as such, I read Count VI as essentially an allegation of exclusive dealing. 
25 More specifically, I understand Count VI as alleging that Microsoft violated § 1 by entering into agreements with 
 [**80] purchasers--OEMs, distributors, and resellers--which de facto committed those purchasers to buy software 
applications exclusively, or almost exclusively, from Microsoft.
Agreements violate § 1 when they unreasonably restrain trade. See, e.g., Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania 
Inc., 433 U.S. 36, 49, 97 S. Ct. 2549, 53 L. Ed. 2d 568 (1977). Exclusive dealing agreements that are alleged to 
violate § 1 are evaluated under the Rule of Reason, which balances the procompetitive justifications against the 
anticompetitive harm. See, e.g., HOLMES, supra note 25. The Tampa Elec. Co v. Nashville Coal Co., 365 U.S. 320, 
327-30, 81 S. Ct. 623, 5 L. Ed. 2d 580 (1961) substantial foreclosure framework basically serves as a proxy for the 
Rule of Reason in analyzing exclusive dealing allegations. 26 Cf. Twin City Sportservice,  [*753]  Inc. v. Charles O. 
23 In its brief before the Fourth Circuit, Microsoft explained  [**78] the procedural posture and history of Count VI:
Because Counts I and VI allege harm in the same PC operating system market at issue in the DOJ Complaint, Microsoft did 
not argue that those two claims were time-barred. . . . There was some confusion in the district court concerning what 
market(s) are at issue in Count VI. Although Count VI does not specify a market, it alleges that Microsoft entered into 
exclusionary distribution agreements in violation of [§ 1]. . . . [S]uch a claim requires proof of harm to ""competition as a 
whole within"" at least one antitrust market. Novell provided no indication that Count VI might pertain to the PC operating 
system market (as opposed to the alleged applications markets) until oral argument, at which point Microsoft's counsel 
immediately responded that to the extent that were so, then Count VI should be dismissed for the same reasons as Count I.
Brief of Defendant-Appellant Microsoft Corp. at *12-*13, *13 n.4, Novell, Inc. v. Microsoft, Corp., Nos. 06-1134, 06-1238, 2006 
WL 1348322 (4th Cir. Apr. 13, 2006) (internal citations omitted).
24 Novell may have been able to prove restraint of trade in the operating system market by, in part, establishing substantial 
foreclosure in various software applications markets. To do so, however, Novell would have to prove more than just substantial 
foreclosure in those software applications markets; it would also have had to point to evidence showing how and why that 
substantial foreclosure in fact restrained trade in the operating system market.
25 HN21[
] ""Exclusive dealing occurs when . . . a buyer . . . agrees to purchase, license or lease all or a substantial portion of its 
requirements of a product or service exclusively from a particular seller."" WILLIAM C. HOLMES, ANTITRUST LAW HANDBOOK 
§ 2:19 (2009).
26 Although Tampa Electric involved a Clayton Act claim, its analysis pertains to exclusive dealing under § 1 of the Sherman Act 
as well. See Tampa Elec., 365 U.S. at 335 (""We need not discuss the respondents' further contention that the contract also 
violates § 1 and § 2 of the Sherman Act, for if it does not fall within the broader prescriptions of § 3 of the Clayton Act it follows 
699 F. Supp. 2d 730, *751; 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 30756, **76

 
Finley & Co., 676 F.2d 1291, 1301 (9th Cir. 1982) (the Tampa Electric framework ""clearly is to determine the 
anticompetitive effects of exclusive-dealing arrangements"").  [**81] Under Tampa Electric, § 1 liability requires the 
plaintiff to prove that (1) the agreements in question were in fact exclusive, and (2) the exclusive dealing 
substantially lessened competition--that is, the agreements foreclosed competition in a substantial share of the 
relevant market. 27 See, e.g., Tampa Elec., 365 U.S. at 327-30.
b. Project Avalanche Agreements Lacked Exclusivity and Anticompetitiveness  [**83] 28
HN23[
] To be considered ""exclusive"" under antitrust laws, an agreement must either expressly preclude a party 
from doing business with the defendant's competitors, or highly incentivize or have the practical effect of exclusivity. 
See LePage's, 324 F.3d at 157-58 (in analyzing a § 2 claim, noting that ""unilaterally imposed quantity discounts can 
foreclose the opportunities of rivals when a dealer can obtain its best discount only by dealing exclusively with the 
dominant firm"" (quoting 3A PHILLIP E.  [*754]  AREEDA & HERBERT HOVENKAMP, ANTITRUST LAW P 768b2, 
at 148)); Concord Boat Corp. v. Brunswick Corp., 207 F.3d 1039, 1058-59 (8th Cir. 2000) (holding that discount 
that it is not forbidden by those of the former.""). Some ""[c]ourts and commentators disagree as to whether [the Tampa Electric 
test] outlaws a broader range of conduct than does the rule of reason drawn from § 1 of the Sherman Act."" Bepco, 106 F. Supp. 
2d at 827. I believe (1) that exclusive dealing claims under the Clayton Act and the Sherman Act ( § 1) are either subject to the 
same standard or that the Clayton Act is broader and (2) that the analytical framework for exclusive  [**82] dealing claims under 
§ 1 is the same as that articulated in Tampa Electric. See, e.g., Twin City Sportservice, 676 F.2d at 1301-02 (expressly 
authorizing use of Tampa Electric to analyze exclusive dealing under § 1); United States v. Microsoft Corp., 87 F. Supp 2d 30, 
52-53 (D.D.C. 2000), rev 'd on other grounds by 253 F.3d (utilizing Tampa Electric, or something close to it, in analyzing a § 1 
claim); Masimo Corp. v. Tyco Health Care Group, L.P., 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29977, 2006 WL 1236666, at *4 n.2, *4-*8 (C.D. 
Cal. 2006) (unpublished) (utilizing Tampa Electric, or something close to it, in analyzing a § 1 claim and noting ""it is easier to 
meet the threshold of foreclosure for a [Clayton Act] violation that it is for a § 1 violation"" (citing Twin City Sportservice, 676 F.2d 
at 1304 n.9)).
27 Section 1 HN22[
] only covers ""contract[s], combination[s] . . ., or conspiracy[ies]."" In contrast to the pattern of unilateral 
conduct that was considered in analyzing the § 2 claim in Count I, agreements between Microsoft and third parties are the only 
allegedly anticompetitive conduct that may be considered in assessing the anticompetitive harm in Count VI.
28 Microsoft also argues that the Project Avalanche agreements may not form the basis of Count VI because (1) ""[h]ad Novell 
alleged harm to competition in channels other than the OEM channel, that allegation would have been barred by the statute of 
limitations because it would not have been based in whole or in part on any matter complained of in the Government case"" and 
(2) Novell did not include such allegations in its Complaint.
As to Microsoft's first argument, a claim arising from the Project Avalanche agreements may still have been tolled because 
Novell alleges that those agreements caused harm in the PC operating  [**85] system market. See Novell, 505 F.3d at 307 
(quoting 15 U.S.C. § 16(i)) (""Section 5(i) of the Clayton Act HN24[
] provides that government antitrust proceedings toll the 
statute of limitations for private antitrust actions 'based in whole or in part on any matter complained of' by the government. 
Novell's Counts I and VI are indeed based on Microsoft's anticompetitive conduct in the PC operating-systems market, which 
was at issue in the DOJ Complaint.""); see also Novell, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11520, 2005 WL 1398643, at *3 (internal citation 
omitted) (""The governing test is whether the matters complained of in the private action 'bear a real relation' to a matter 
complained of in the government suit."").
I also am unpersuaded by Microsoft's second argument. Again, a complaint need only contain a ""short and plain statement of 
the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief."" Erickson, 551 U.S. at 93 (quoting FED. R. CIV. P. 8(a)(2)). Although 
""specific facts are not necessary,"" the Complaint must ""'give the defendant fair notice of what the . . . claim is and the grounds 
upon which it rests.'"" Id. (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555). Novell's Complaint put Microsoft on fair notice that it would bring 
claims based on  [**86] agreements in the finished goods channel. The Complaint included a section entitled ""Other Distribution 
Channels,"" in which Novell alleged ""anticompetitive tactics"" in ""the following channels: independent retailers that sell to individual 
and small businesses; independent or loosely affiliated resellers that sell to larger organizations . . .; and direct sales to 
government agencies, large corporations, and other large organizations."" (Compl. PP 132-33.) Presumably in an effort to 
strengthen its argument about the relatedness between Count VI and the government's suit, Novell only highlighted the OEM 
agreements in opposing the Motion to Dismiss, and accordingly both this Court and the Fourth Circuit focused on the OEM 
agreements as the crux of Count VI. Nonetheless, the fact that the Complaint itself challenges non-OEM agreements leads me 
to conclude that I should consider the allegations about the Project Avalanche agreements.
699 F. Supp. 2d 730, *753; 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 30756, **78

 
purchase agreements that did not require buyers to commit to buying a seller's products for any specified time 
period were not ""exclusive"" because buyers ""were free to walk away from the discounts at any time""); Masimo 
Corp., 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29977, 2006 WL 1236666, at 3, *5-6 (holding that, where defendant gave 
substantially larger discounts to a hospital if it satisfied over 90 percent of its need for ""pulse oximetry systems"" with 
purchases from the defendant, the jury reasonably concluded that agreements were exclusive because defendant 
""in practical  [**84] effect, offered hospitals their best discount only if they dealt with [defendant] exclusively""); 
Microsoft Corp., 87 F. Supp 2d at 52-53, rev'd on other grounds by 253 F.3d 34, 346 U.S. App. D.C. 330 (finding a 
contract to be exclusive where it imposed ""severe shipment quotas and promotional restrictions for third-party 
[products]""); see also R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. v. Phillip Morris Inc., 199 F. Supp. 2d 362, 387 (M.D.N.C. 2002) 
(""[Exclusive dealing] arrangements typically involve requirements contracts, non-competition clauses, and 
agreements giving discounts in exchange for exclusivity."").
Novell has not raised a genuine issue of fact about whether the Project Avalanche agreements with distributors and 
resellers were exclusive. These agreements were not typical exclusive agreements such as requirements contracts 
or non-competition agreements. Unlike  [**87] in Masimo, Microsoft did not offer its best discount only if distributors 
dealt exclusively, or close to exclusively, with Microsoft. Like any discount, the more the distributor purchased the 
discounted products, the greater it benefited from the discount; but there was no particularly appealing benefit 
hinging on exclusivity or anything close to it. Nor did these agreements directly penalize distributors and resellers 
for selling non-Microsoft products. Rather, Microsoft simply offered distributors a modest rebate for increasing their 
sales and ""blended share"" of Microsoft products. (See Dkt. No. 1952, Exh. 123.) Incentivizing increased sales and 
share, at least to the extent that these agreements did, hardly has the ""practical effect"" of exclusivity. In fact, as 
Microsoft points out, distributors subject to these agreements were also responsible for 48 percent of Novell's sales 
in 1995. Cf. R.J. Reynolds, 199 F. Supp. 2d at 390 (""Plaintiffs . . . have been successful in securing merchandising 
contracts with [stores subject to a CMO3 contract with the defendant], which suggest that [the product] sold in 
CMO3 stores is an inappropriate figure for the foreclosure analysis."").
Although  [**88] their lack of exclusivity alone may doom their viability as a basis for § 1 liability, see supra note 26, 
the Project Avalanche agreements are also not anticompetitive by any other measure. First, these agreements 
warrant ""less cause for anticompetitive concern"" because they were ""imposed on distributors rather than end 
users."" Omega Envtl., Inc. v. Gilbarco, Inc., 127 F.3d 1157, 1163 (9th Cir. 1997). ""If competitors can reach the 
ultimate consumers of the product by employing existing or potential alternative channels of distribution it is unclear 
whether such restrictions foreclose from competition any part of the relevant market."" Id. Accord Microsoft Corp., 87 
F. Supp. 2d at 53 (finding exclusive agreements with distributors did not foreclose a substantial share of the market 
because internet browser developers could always sell browsers directly to end-users). Further, these agreements 
basically entail price-cutting, which is particularly likely to have procompetitive and pro-consumer benefits.
 [*755]  In short, because the Project Avalanche agreements were not exclusive or otherwise anticompetitive, they 
may not form the basis of Novell's § I claim.
c. Agreements with OEMs Did Not Substantially  [**89] Foreclose Competition
As discussed above, HN25[
] to succeed on a § 1 claim under Tampa Electric, a plaintiff must prove that the 
defendant's conduct foreclosed competition in a ""substantial"" share of the relevant market. See, e.g., Tampa Elec., 
365 U.S. at 327-28; R.J. Reynolds, 199 F. Supp. 2d at 387. Substantial foreclosure depends on many factors--the 
parties' market strength, the degree of exclusivity, business justifications for the agreement, duration of the 
agreement, barriers to entry in the market, etc.--but requires that the agreements at issue cover at least 20 percent 
of the relevant market (and usually significantly more than that). 29 See Tampa Elec., 365 U.S. at 328-29, 334-35; 
Microsoft, 253 F.3d at 70 (noting ""the roughly 40% or 50% share usually required in order to establish a § 1 
violation""); Bepco, 106 F. Supp. 2d at 828 (21.5 percent and 18.5 percent ""fall short of any value presumed to be 
substantial and lie on the margin of what is considered to be significant""); R.J. Reynolds, 199 F. Supp. 2d at 387-
29 ""The relevant market for this purpose includes the full range of selling opportunities reasonably open to rivals . . ."" Omega 
Envtl., 127 F.3d at 1162 (quoting 2A Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law P 570b1, at 278).
699 F. Supp. 2d 730, *754; 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 30756, **86

 
88, 391-92 (noting that the lowest coverage courts and commentators have found significant is 20 percent and that 
courts have found agreements covering up to 50 percent  [**90] of the market to not be substantial).
Because the Project Avalanche agreements are not exclusive or otherwise anticompetitive, to survive summary 
judgment on Count VI Novell must raise a genuine issue about whether the per system and minimum purchase 
agreements between Microsoft and OEMs resulted in substantial foreclosure. 30 But cf. R.J. Reynolds, 199 F. Supp. 
2d at 387-88 (holding that Phillip Morris offering retailers discounts in exchange for advantageous advertising space 
was not exclusive dealing but nonetheless ""us [ing] the substantial foreclosure analysis typically used in exclusive 
dealing cases""). However, Novell has not presented evidence that these agreements covered close to twenty 
percent of any software applications market, and it has therefore failed to meet its burden. (See Dkt. No. 1947, Exh. 
45.) In fact, Novell does not seem to contest Microsoft's assertion that the OEM agreements covered at most 10 
percent of any relevant market.  [**91] (See id., Exh. 45; Dkt. No. 1952 at 43-45.) Even if 10 percent could ever 
amount to substantial foreclosure, which I do not believe it could, Novell has failed to point to any market factor 
significant enough to support a substantial foreclosure finding with such a small segment of the market covered. 31 
 [*756]  In sum, because Microsoft's agreements with OEMs did not foreclose a substantial share of any software 
applications market--and the Project Avalanche agreements were not exclusive or otherwise anticompetitive--a § 1 
claim here would not survive summary judgment even if the issue was restraining trade in the software applications 
markets. Furthermore, Novell has not met its burden of providing evidence that Microsoft's conduct created an 
unreasonable restraint in the PC operating system market, and for that reason alone Count VI would have failed 
even if Novell had not assigned it to Caldera. 32

ORDER
For the reasons stated in the accompanying Memorandum, it is, this 30th day of March, 2010
ORDERED
1. Defendant's motion  [**93] for summary judgment is granted;
2. Plaintiff's cross-motion for summary judgment is denied; and
3. Judgment is entered in favor of defendant against plaintiff.
/s/
30 This assumes, without deciding, that these agreements with OEMs would in fact be considered exclusive or anticompetitive.
31 The § 1 legality of these minimum purchase and per system agreements is distinguishable from the Section 1 legality of 
Microsoft's minimum purchase, per system, per copy, and per processor agreements with OEMs covered by Judge Jackson's 
consent order in 1995. In that case, the OEM agreements concerned the distribution of PC operating systems, a market in which 
OEMs control a substantially greater percentage of the distribution channels than they do in the various software applications 
markets. See United States v. Microsoft, 159 F.R.D. 318, 1995 WL 505998 (D.D.C. 1995); see also United States v. Microsoft 
Corp, 159 F.R.D. 318, 322 n.9 (D.D.C. 1995) (""In the first half of 1994, 80% of Windows units sold by Microsoft were through 
OEMs.""), rev'd by 56 F.3d 1448, 312 U.S. App. D.C. 378 (D.C. Cir.). Consequently,  [**92] anticompetitive or exclusive OEM 
agreements in the PC operating system market foreclosed a much greater amount of competition.
32 Microsoft also argues that Novell ""abandoned"" Count VI because it failed to offer expert evidence of the damages it suffered 
as a result of the conduct alleged in Count VI. (See Dkt. No. 1947 at 44.) Because Count VI may be resolved on other grounds, I 
did not reach this issue.
