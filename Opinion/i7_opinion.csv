ORDER ON DESIGNATION
1. THIS MATTER is before the Court pursuant to the Order of the Honorable Cheri Beasley, Chief Justice of the 
Supreme Court of North Carolina, directing the undersigned to determine whether this action is properly designated 
as a mandatory complex business case in accord with N.C. Gen. Stat. § 7A-45.4(a) (the ""Determination Order"").
2. Plaintiff filed the Complaint initiating this action in Guilford County Superior Court on May 20, 2019, asserting 
claims for tortious interference with contract, and unfair and deceptive trade practices under N.C. Gen. Stat. § 75-
1.1. Plaintiff timely filed the Notice of Designation (""NOD"") on the same day.
3. Plaintiff contends that designation as a mandatory business case is proper under N.C. Gen. Stat. § 7A-45.4(a)(3) 
(""7A-45.4(a)(3)""), (NOD 1), which provides for designation of ""an action that involves a material issue related to . . . 
[d]isputes involving antitrust law, including disputes arising under Chapter 75 of the General Statutes that do not 
arise solely under G.S. 75-1.1 or Article 2 of Chapter 75 of the General Statutes."" Plaintiff does not seek to base 
designation on any provision of 7A-45.4(a) other than section 7A-45.4(a)(3).
4. In support of designation, Plaintiff argues that the factual allegations supporting its claims for tortious 
interference [*2]  with contract and violation of Chapter 75 satisfy the requirements of section 7A-45.4(a)(3). 
Plaintiff's Chapter 75 claim, however, is brought solely under section 75-1.1 and Plaintiff does not reference, invoke, 
or otherwise seek recovery under any other provision of Chapter 75 in its Complaint. Nor does Plaintiff allege or 

 
contend that the current action involves consideration and application of federal or state antitrust law, other than 
section 75-1.1. As such, designation is improper because Plaintiff's Chapter 75 claim in this action arises solely 
under N.C. Gen. Stat. § 75-1.1, there has been no showing that the dispute otherwise involves antitrust law, and 
Plaintiff has not identified any other basis for designation of this action as a mandatory complex business case. See 
Market Am., Inc. v. Doyle, 15 CVS 9658, 2016 NCBC LEXIS 182, Order at 2, ECF No. 36.
5. Based on the foregoing, the Court determines that this action is not properly designated as a mandatory complex 
business case in accord with N.C. Gen. Stat. § 7A-45.4(a) and thus shall not be assigned to a Special Superior 
Court Judge for Complex Business Cases.
6. Consistent with the Determination Order, the Court hereby advises the Senior Resident Superior Court Judge of 
Judicial District 18 that this action is not properly designated as a [*3]  mandatory complex business case so that 
the action may be treated as any other civil action, wherein designation as a Rule 2.1 exceptional case may be 
pursued with the Senior Resident Judge.
7. The Court's ruling is without prejudice to the right of any other party to seek designation of this matter as a 
mandatory complex business case as provided under section 7A-45.4.
SO ORDERED, this the 30th day of May, 2019.

1293,Opinion by,Opinion by: Jeffrey L. Bleich
1297,Counsel,"Counsel: In their Opposition to Class Counsel's motion and in their subsequent motions, 
Objecting Members appeared to contend that Class Counsel had failed to adequately represent their interests as 
members of the DPP class. In their Opposition to Class Counsel's motion, Objecting Members claimed that 
Class [*48]  Counsel had failed to ""meet their fiduciary duty of candor owed to Aptiv as a member of the class"" 
(MDL Dkt. No. 391 at 2 n. 1), suggested Class Counsel had ""inherent conflicts . . . in resolving intra-class disputes 
about claims that may be in and out of a class"" (id. at 4 n.2), and contended that in light of the FTAIA II Order, ""as a 
fiduciary to Objecting Members, Class Counsel have an obligation to ensure and fight for the inclusion of these 
[FTAIA] claims."" Id. at 6. In their own motion, Objecting Members asserted that ""[t]he instant dispute demonstrates 
an intra-class conflict. . . because Class Counsel inadequately represents Objecting Members and similarly situated 
class members."" MDL Dkt. No. 473 at 6 n.7. At oral argument, Objecting Members did not assert that Class 
Counsel had behaved in a manner that had uniquely prejudiced them (Tr. 27-28), or that there was an irreconcilable 
conflict in Class Counsel's continued representation, nor did they request any particular relief with respect to Class 
Counsel's continued representation going forward. Tr. at 104-07. Again, the Special Master is grateful to the parties 
for limiting their claims such that these issues are not presented to the Court.
 [*49] Prior Admissions, Representations, and Reliance:
In their respective pleadings and at oral argument, the parties cast various aspersions on one another for past 
statements. Class Counsel initially claimed Objecting Members had previously acknowledged that incorporated 
capacitors did not qualify for compensation in the DPP proceedings during the First-Round Settlements. MDL Dkt. 
No. 396 at 10-12. Class Counsel has since acknowledged that positions taken in the First Round Settlements do 
not bind the parties in this round. Tr. at 102 (Mr. Williams: ""[T]he first round sort of stood on its own, and it's over, 
and we're now in the second round, and they have the right to bring the arguments they're bringing, and that's why 
we're here, to try to resolve them.""). Objecting Members claimed that Class Counsel had misleadingly caused them 
to believe it would pursue incorporated capacitor claims and had acknowledged their legitimacy. MDL Dkt. No. 391 
at 1 (""Class Counsel improperly deny portions of Objecting Members' claims for capacitors incorporated into 
finished products sold in the US. . . in spite of. . . Class Counsel's own assertions that such claims are 
recoverable.""). Objecting Members [*50]  now acknowledge this is not one of their contentions. Tr. at 75 (""Mr. 
Sasse: We're not resting on any representation made by class counsel directly to Cisco and Aptiv. And that may be 
a full stop answer to your question."").
2. Issues As Yet Unresolved
The issues now in dispute have reduced to four discrete issues.
First, whether the claims for incorporated capacitors were actually released as part of the settlement such that they 
need to be compensated if viable.
Second, whether based on the Court's FTAIA decisions and other precedents, Objecting Members have stated a 
sufficiently viable claim for relief for incorporated capacitor claims under the Sherman Act or the FTAIA to warrant 
compensating these claims in the allocation process.
Third, whether this class-wide allocation process is an inappropriate mechanism for resolving claims for the 
incorporated capacitor purchases at issue because it does not allow for a proper individualized showing, and 
whether Cisco and Aptiv's claims should be denied for their failure either to object to the settlement or to opt out 
and pursue a remedy as Flextronics has.
2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 232309, *47

 
And fourth, whether — even if such claims theoretically warrant compensation and are appropriate [*51]  for this 
proceeding — Objecting Members have failed to provide the Court or Class Counsel with proof of particular 
elements to support such a claim. This includes, for example, failure to establish that the Settling Defendants in this 
action knew or should have known that the capacitor sales at issue were intended for a U.S. market at the time of 
sale.
Special Masters' Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law
A. Release Language
The parties agree that a foundational question concerns whether incorporated capacitor claims are even included in 
the Settlement's release provisions with Hitachi and Soshin. Class Counsel asserts that regardless of whether the 
Objecting Members' incorporated capacitor claims would be legally viable, those claims were not included in the 
settlement or release, and thus Objecting Members are not prejudiced by the proposed allocation in this 
proceeding. The scope of the release is ultimately a question of contract interpretation and requires addressing 
each aspect of the disagreement over the meaning of the release language.10
Class Counsel argues that the plain language of the release11 demonstrates that incorporated [*52]  capacitors are 
not covered because that language refers only to: (1) ""capacitors"" (rather than ""incorporated capacitors""); (2) 
""directly shipped to or billed to the United States"" (rather than non-U.S. purchases); and (3) sold in a manner not 
excluded from liability by the FTAIA. Class Counsel contends that none of these three requirements applies to 
Objecting Members' incorporated capacitor claims. Class Counsel also contends that the Objecting Members' 
contemporaneous conduct further demonstrates that Objecting Members did not believe the release covered 
incorporated capacitor claims.
1. ""Capacitors"" versus ""Incorporated Capacitors""
The first point of disagreement is whether the term ""capacitors"" in the settlement agreement refers only to raw 
capacitors billed or shipped to the U.S. or whether it may encompass capacitors that were purchased for delivery to 
the U.S. once they were incorporated into another product.
Class Counsel contends that the plain language of the release makes clear that it refers only to raw capacitors. The 
release, it points out, refers to ""capacitors"" but contains no reference to ""incorporated capacitors."" Tr. at 32:11-33:8. 
Class Counsel argues this is because [*53]  the parties only contemplated releasing claims associated with the sale 
of raw or unincorporated capacitors. Accordingly, Class Counsel argues that as a matter of contract interpretation, 
the Court should not insert the word ""incorporated"" where it does not belong.
Objecting Members respond that the language of the release and their course of dealings shows just the opposite. 
They note that the release is extremely broad and does not expressly or implicitly exclude their claims related to 
incorporated capacitors. Objecting Members argue that incorporated capacitors are still ""capacitors""; they were 
purchased in their original state for ultimate shipment to the U.S. Accordingly, they maintain, the settlement 
agreement does not need to refer to incorporated versus non-incorporated capacitors, because that distinction does 
not bear on whether a claim exists, or to whom the capacitor is shipped or billed at the time of its original purchase.
On this issue, the Objecting Members' position is more persuasive. If the release, for example, referred only to 
""unincorporated"" or ""raw"" capacitors, that would be dispositive for Class Counsel. But the release refers only to the 
purchase of ""capacitors,"" [*54]  and does not draw a distinction beyond that. Because the term is not modified in 
10 The Special Master notes that the district court in a separate MDL action recently recognized the obligation of counsel to 
ensure that class members not release their claims without compensation in the context of a settlement. See In re Cathode Ray 
Tube (CRT) Antitrust Litigation, MDL No. 1917, Case No. 3:07-cv-05944-JST (""CRT""), Dkt. No. 5362 (Order Denying JPPs' Mot. 
Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 62.1) at 1 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 8, 2018).
11 Although there are separate releases in this matter, the operative language for these parties is identical.
2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 232309, *50

 
some way, in the context of a broad release, the natural reading is that it applies to any and all sales of these 
defendants' aluminum, tantalum, or film capacitors. Indeed, it seems unlikely, that having submitted such claims in 
the First Round, and having expressly reserved their right to make claims for incorporated capacitors in this 
subsequent round, Objecting Members would deliberately omit those claims from the release and undermine their 
basis for receiving compensation for them in the Second Round settlement. At the very least, one would expect the 
parties to use more specific language if their intention was indeed to exclude these claims from the release.
2. ""Shipped To"" or ""Billed To"" the United States
Class Counsel argues next that the release is expressly limited to capacitors ""shipped to"" or ""billed to"" the U.S., and 
therefore capacitors acquired by foreign agents of Cisco and Aptiv on behalf of Cisco and Aptiv outside the U.S. for 
incorporation into finished U.S. products do not qualify. Tr. at 73:24-74:5. Class Counsel notes that the release 
specifically refers to acts ""concerning the purchase, [*55]  pricing, selling, discounting marketing manufacturing 
and/or distributing of Capacitors in the United States and its territories or for delivery in the United States and its 
territories."" MDL Dkt. No. 489 at 4 (quoting Hitachi release at para. 14). Class Counsel maintains that incorporated 
capacitor sales do not meet this requirement because — by definition — they are not sold directly into the United 
States, but are sold and shipped to an entity outside the U.S. to be incorporated into a finished good.
Objecting Members argue that Class Counsel simply misreads the releases and thus the scope of compensable 
claims. In their view, the releases expressly encompass their incorporated capacitor purchases. Specifically, they 
contend the release extends to acts ""concerning the purchase, pricing, selling, discounting, marketing, 
manufacturing and/or distributing of Capacitors in the United States and its territories or for delivery in the 
United States and its territories."" MDL Dkt. No. 473 (quoting Dkt. No. 1989-2, Para. 2; Dkt. No. 1989-3, Para. 14) 
(emphasis added). Objecting members contend that they priced and marketed all of their purchases of capacitors in 
their U.S. headquarters, including [*56]  capacitors that were incorporated into products for import into the United 
States.
The plain language of the release better supports Objecting Members' interpretation. The settlement and release 
encompass capacitors negotiated for purchase from the U.S. or for delivery to the U.S. in the manner that Objecting 
Members allege for incorporated capacitors. As noted, Objecting Members claim they negotiated the price and sale 
of the Settling Defendants' capacitors from the United States, and that they also arranged for distribution and 
delivery of these products into the U.S. in finished goods. The natural reading of this provision does not preclude 
claims for a capacitor that was sold to a U.S. entity to be incorporated into a finished product on its way to the U.S. 
In addition, this comports with other rulings already issued by the Court in this matter. As the Court has already 
found in its FTAIA II Order, incorporated capacitor purchases can be a form of transaction that qualifies as import 
trade or import commerce under the Sherman Act, or that satisfies the domestic effects exception to the FTAIA. 
Accordingly, Class Counsel's arguments are not persuasive on this point.
3. Exception for [*57]  Claims Excluded by the FTAIA
Alternatively, Class Counsel relies on Section C of the release, which specifically excludes any claims based on 
purchases of capacitors that are not allowed under the FTAIA. The language upon which Class Counsel relies is as 
follows:
The Released Claims also include, but are not limited to, all claims asserted or which could have been 
asserted in the Action relating to or arising out of the facts. . . alleged in the Action, including but not limited to, 
claims arising under federal or state antitrust, unfair competition, unfair practices, price discrimination, unitary 
pricing, trade practice, or civil conspiracy law, including without limitation the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 1, et 
seq., but excluding. .. (c) claims based on purchases of Capacitors excluded by the Foreign Trade 
Antitrust Improvement Act, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 6a.
Dkt No. 1989-2, Para 12; Dkt. No. 1989-3, Para. 14 (emphasis added).
Class Counsel contends that Objecting Members did not release their claims for incorporated capacitors without 
compensation, because such claims are excluded by the FTAIA, and thus excluded from the release. Class 
2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 232309, *54

 
Counsel suggests that Section C should also be read in light of the provisions limiting the released [*58]  claims to 
purchases and deliveries in the United States.
Objecting Members argue that Class Counsel's argument about the FTAIA proves too much. At the time of this 
settlement, the FTAIA I Order had left open the possibility that incorporated capacitor cases could be viable under 
the FTAIA (albeit not under a global pricing theory). Objecting Members had, in fact, reserved all of their claims for 
the Second Round and submitted claims for incorporated capacitors. Tr. at 38. This would suggest that there was 
no agreement that their incorporated capacitor claims were excluded under the FTAIA. Objecting Members 
moreover contend that their purchases were functionally indistinguishable from the transactions alleged by 
Flextronics in the FTAIA proceedings. Aptiv asserts that its method of purchasing incorporated capacitors was not 
different from that of Flextronics — i.e., like Flextronics, its overseas subsidiary capacitors bought on Aptiv's behalf 
that it incorporated into a finished product for shipment to Aptiv in the U.S. to sell. Likewise, Cisco claims its 
subsidiaries either operated in that same way through Cisco subsidiaries, or that Cisco acquired assignments from 
other parties (including [*59]  Flextronics) that it engaged outside the U.S. who operated as their subsidiaries would. 
Thus, Objecting Members contend that the parties' conduct and this Court's decisions demonstrate that the claims 
presented here do not fall under Section C's exception to the release, and are thus released.
Objecting Members have the better argument in this instance, as well. At the time the release language was 
negotiated, the parties were aware of the dispute about whether incorporated capacitor claims were barred by the 
FTAIA. Objecting Members had reserved those claims for the Second Round, and the Court in its FTAIA I Order 
had acknowledged the potential viability of some incorporated capacitor claims depending on the facts. Thus, it 
would be reasonable to assume that Objecting Members believed that the release encompassed actions that relied 
upon FTAIA claims, and that Section C would not exclude from release their incorporated capacitor claims which 
were viable under the FTAIA.12
4. Course of Dealings
Lastly, in support of their interpretation of the release, Class Counsel looks to the course of dealings between the 
parties, and their understanding at the time the release was signed. Class [*60]  Counsel emphasizes that the 
notice and claim form negotiated with the Settling Defendants by DPPs did not refer to incorporated capacitors. 
Moreover, as of July 2018 when the release was executed, there had been no determination that Objecting 
Members' claims for incorporated capacitors would be allowed under the FTAIA and no indication that Class 
Counsel would pursue them. Moreover, Class Counsel claims the Court itself had raised concerns in proceedings 
with the Indirect Product Purchaser (IPP) class, about the workability of including incorporated capacitor claims in a 
class context. Tr. at 34. If anything, the FTAIA I Order that had been issued at this time emphasized the 
individualized nature of these claims, and suggested they had a limited prospect for success in any case. Class 
Counsel contends that until the FTAIA II Order came out two months later, in September, Objecting Members did 
nothing to suggest they believed their incorporated capacitor claims were genuinely DPP class claims eligible for 
compensation in the Second Round Settlement and subject to its release. Thus, Class Counsel argues that 
Objecting Members had no reasonable expectation that these claims were at issue [*61]  and could be resolved in 
this settlement, and thus never objected to, opted out of, or raised concerns about the release's application to 
incorporated capacitors claims at the time the release was negotiated and executed.
Class Counsel makes a valid point that Objecting Members' attitude regarding their incorporated capacitor claims 
appears to have changed significantly after the FTAIA II Order was issued. As Class Counsel notes, if Objecting 
Members had been committed to ensuring that they would be compensated for such claims at the time of the 
12 The parties devote substantial briefing to the application of the ""identical factual predicate"" doctrine articulated in Hesse v. 
Sprint Corp., 598 F.3d 581, 590 (9th Cir. 2010). Objecting Members urge that since their incorporated capacitor claims arise 
from the same factual predicate — i.e., price-fixing by Settling Defendants in their capacitor sales to Objecting Members — then 
their claim would be interpreted as released even if they had not presented the claim and even if it were not presentable in a 
class action. Class Counsel urges a more narrow reading of the doctrine that would exclude claims that lack a ""common interest"" 
with the other class members. The Special Master need not resolve this dispute because it finds that the release does in fact 
encompass incorporated capacitor claims.
2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 232309, *57

 
settlement and release, they had several options available to them to express that expectation. They could have 
opted out of the settlement to pursue these claims; they could have negotiated for language that expressly included 
incorporated capacitor claims in the settlement and release; or — in Cisco's case — they could have pursued 
compensation through separate negotiations or proceedings with their third-party contractors. However, while Class 
Counsel's arguments may go to the appropriateness of the approach Objecting Members have selected to resolve 
their claims, it does not prove that they understood their claims to be outside the scope [*62]  of the settlement. 
There are a number of strategic and tactical reasons why Objecting Members might not take the actions Class 
Counsel suggests that have nothing to do with their assumptions about the scope of the settlement and release. 
Moreover, the Court's FTAIA I Order — while expressing skepticism about incorporated capacitor claims — did not 
foreclose DPPs from pursuing such claims. Rather, it found them sufficiently meritorious to allow Flextronics to 
bring forward facts and new legal theories in support of those claims in the FTAIA II proceeding. It therefore seems 
unlikely that — again — Objecting Members would abandon that claim without doing so expressly or with some 
clear strategic reason for doing so. Accordingly, the Special Master is not persuaded by the parties' course of 
conduct that the release reflects the parties' intention to exclude incorporated capacitor claims from the scope of the 
release.
Accordingly, the Special Master finds that incorporated capacitor claims were encompassed within the Second 
Round Settlement Release agreement.
B. Viability of an Incorporated Capacitor Claim
Objecting Members urge that the Court's FTAIA II Order defines qualifying capacitor [*63]  purchases in a manner 
that requires that they receive compensation for their incorporated capacitor purchases. MDL Dkt. No. 391 at 4; 
MDL Dkt. No. 473 at 8-10. They further contend that these claims must be compensated in this proceeding not only 
because the Second Round Settlement Release includes incorporated capacitor claims, but also because the 
FTAIA II Order demonstrates that these are viable claims. MDL Dkt. No. 391 at 5-7. They have refined these 
arguments further in their Motion for an Order Approving their Second Round Settlement Claims.
Objecting Members observe that the Court's FTAIA I Order held that DPPs' claims for incorporated capacitors were 
not barred as a matter of law, and that the FTAIA II Order found that incorporated capacitors ""may be subject to the 
Sherman Act as 'import trade or commerce'. . . [and] might also come within the FTAIA's domestic effects 
exception."" MDL Dkt. No. 472 at 7 (quoting FTAIA II Order at 7-9).13 Objecting Members argue that their claims are 
functionally indistinguishable from those presented by Flextronics in the FTAIA proceedings, and thus are no less 
viable in these proceedings. They note that like Flextronics, they make claims for incorporated [*64]  capacitors 
where the defendants knew a substantial portion of the capacitors purchased on their behalf would be sold in the 
United States. Their fact pattern is thus substantially similar to that of Flextronics, in that: (1) the Objecting Members 
negotiated prices directly with the Settling Defendants; (2) the Objecting Members either purchased or directed the 
purchase of capacitors based on these prices; and (3) Defendants knew or should have known that a substantial 
share of the capacitors being purchased were destined for finished products that would be sold in the U.S. MDL 
Dkt. No. 329.
Class Counsel argues that the FTAIA Orders do not support Objecting Members' claims, and if anything, 
demonstrate the inappropriateness of this procedure for resolving their claims. First, Class Counsel notes that the 
Court based its decision in the FTAIA II Order on a specific factual showing in the context of a summary judgment 
hearing. The Court's decision reveals how this type of claim is inherently fact-specific and not readily susceptible to 
class-treatment. Tr. at 15. Class Counsel further argues that the Court itself emphasized to Objecting Members at a 
prior hearing that the FTAIA decision [*65]  was fact-based and limited to Flextronics.14 Indeed, Class Counsel 
13 Like the Court, Objecting Members rely on various Ninth Circuit authorities that reach similar conclusions, including United 
States v. Hsiung, 778 F.3d 738, 748-58 (9th Cir. 2015), and five district court decisions in this Circuit. MDL Dkt. No. 473 at 7.
14 Tr. at 23 (quoting the Court): ""I held for Flextronics, not you or anyone else, that they were entitled to do that set of claims. . . . 
I did not articulate a general principle that was based on what I did for Flextronics on its evidentiary showing. So I'm not sure why 
you think this is a broad proposition that applies to every potential claimant.""
2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 232309, *61

 
explains that it is precisely this fact-bound nature of such claims that make them inappropriate for class treatment, 
and why Class Counsel chose not to pursue such claims on behalf of the DPPs. Class Counsel explains that in light 
of the FTAIA I Order, it deliberately limited the class to parties who purchased capacitors ""shipped to"" and ""billed to"" 
the U.S. precisely to avoid these sorts of factual differences. MDL Dkt. No. 489 at 12. Class Counsel further relies 
on the Court's own order certifying the DPP class as commending Class Counsel's determination to ""accept the 
Court's prior FTAIA ruling and to limit their case only to those categories of transactions the Court ruled were 
properly in the case."" Id. at 12 (citing MDL Dkt. No. 385 at 6-7).
While the Special Master is sympathetic to Class Counsel's arguments that the Objecting Members have not at this 
juncture provided evidence comparable to that offered by Flextronics, that Flextronics itself might not prevail at trial 
(it merely survived summary judgment), and that Objecting Members may have an even weaker case than 
Flextronics (or for that matter other DPPs who did not [*66]  present claims for incorporated capacitors), these 
issues go to the value of the claims, not their viability. Class Counsel has discretion to evaluate claims in a manner 
that recognizes that some categories of claims are more compelling than others, and to treat them accordingly. 
However, in the context of a class settlement, class members need not prove they would prevail at trial — a point 
on which both parties ultimately agreed at the hearing on this matter. Tr. at 19-20. Rather, the claim need only be 
viable. Accordingly, Class Counsel may choose to apply a lower recovery rate to these sorts of claims based on 
their value relative to other categories of claims, but this is different from determining that the claims are not viable 
at all.
Likewise, Class Counsel's contention that this category of claim is too fact-specific to be subject to class-wide relief 
goes to the appropriateness of the process Objecting Members pursued rather than the viability of the claim. The 
FTAIA II Order establishes that incorporated capacitor claims of the type alleged here are potentially viable. The 
Court's order granting class certification did not expressly foreclose incorporated capacitor claims [*67]  and indeed 
those claims were made by class members in both the first and second settlement rounds following certification. 
Accordingly, while the process that Objecting Members have selected to vindicate their claims may diminish the 
value of those claims, it does not bear on whether those claims are ultimately viable as a matter of law for DPPs.
Accordingly, without judging their merits, the Special Master finds that incorporated capacitor claims alleged by 
Objecting Members that are sufficiently analogous to those that survived summary judgment in the FTAIA II 
proceeding, are viable. The Special Master addresses separately the effect of the procedural posture on those 
claims.
C. Appropriateness of Procedural Posture
Class Counsel makes a compelling argument that even if Objecting Members (and some other DPPs) have 
potentially viable incorporated capacitor claims and even if those claims are released in this settlement, it is Class 
Counsel's prerogative not to pursue them, if doing so would be damaging to the Class as a whole.
Class Counsel argues that Objecting Members chose the wrong process by which to address their incorporated 
capacitor claims, and that Class Counsel is within its [*68]  discretion not to pursue them in future rounds or to 
allocate funds to them now to the detriment of the class as a whole. Class Counsel suggests that other DPPs may 
have incorporated capacitor claims that they did not bring because they were too individualized, and that they 
sacrificed those claims for the advantages of gaining class-wide relief. Class Counsel commends Flextronics as 
having made an appropriate choice that was equally available to the Objecting Members to opt out from the class 
and make a particularized showing to establish that the transaction affected import commerce and/or had a 
domestic effect in the United States. Objecting Members, Class Counsel complains, want to have it both ways. If 
they wished to pursue these claims, they should either have objected to the settlement or opted out so that they 
could make their showing to the Court as Flextronics did.
Class Counsel also condemns Cisco's approach of seeking to recover claims on behalf of Foxconn, Jabil, 
Celestica, and Flextronics based on assignments obtained post-litigation. Class Counsel notes that how Cisco and 
these companies wish to divvy up any settlements is a separate matter for them, and that Cisco is [*69]  needlessly 
complicating this proceeding by demanding that it receive other parties' allocation in the first instance.
2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 232309, *65

 
Objecting Members respond, essentially, that the approach they've pursued is the least worst option among a 
number of imperfect choices. Given their millions of dollars in ""raw"" capacitor claims and the uncertainty of the 
Court's treatment of incorporated capacitor claims, no option was ideal. Objecting Members point out that they have 
been consistent. They brought incorporated capacitor claims in the First Round, they preserved their right to do so 
in the Second Round, and they appropriately pressed those claims after receiving the Court's FTAIA II Order. 
Accordingly, their actions are neither incompatible with participation in the class nor a surprise to Class Counsel. 
They contend that they did not have to object to the settlement because, by its terms, the settlement did not exclude 
incorporated capacitor claims; if anything, they read the release to encompass such claims. Likewise, they maintain 
that they should not be forced to opt out of the class to pursue those claims. They urge that it would be unfair to 
deny them the efficiencies of class treatment merely [*70]  because they have an additional sub-category of direct 
purchase claims that — while distinct — are still claims for capacitors that were ultimately shipped to the United 
States. Finally, they contend it is irrelevant whether they pursued these claims when other class members did not. 
Other class members were free to bring such claims in this round or pursue them in future rounds, and their 
decisions going forward will likely depend on the quality of those claims, their resources, and other such factors. 
Out of a sense of fairness, they have suggested procedures by which other DPPs would be able to make Second 
Round claims for incorporated capacitors as well.15
Finally, with respect to assignments, Cisco contends that its approach is neither inefficient nor improper. It notes 
that as the holder of assignments from Foxconn, Celestica, Jabil, and Flextronics, Cisco stands in their shoes and 
so is the appropriate party to obtain relief for losses they incurred. Paying these claims directly to Cisco is thus 
appropriate and more efficient than Class Counsel's approach of paying the wrong party and then requiring Cisco to 
obtain those funds through a private process.
While there is merit in [*71]  both parties' positions, this simply confirms that — in fact — this issue requires a 
choice among various imperfect processes for resolving these claims. There is obviously some tension in having 
incorporated capacitor claims brought in the DPP class because the volume of these claims may swamp the 
recovery of plaintiffs who do not have such claims. But incorporated capacitor claims are not inherently antagonistic 
to those of other class members. The volume of both types of claims may vary by plaintiff. To the extent that 
incorporated capacitors are a subcategory of DPP claims, any member of the class is equally capable of pursuing 
them. Requiring them to either opt out to preserve those claims, or remain in the class and forego those claims, 
does not seem necessary. And, to the extent that there was any ambiguity about the scope of the release or the 
availability of such claims in this proceeding, all plaintiffs were equally capable of pursuing them as Objecting 
Members did, or to object earlier to demand greater clarity.
Moreover, the choice that Objecting Members made is not cost-free. As noted, had Objecting Members chosen a 
different path, they would have been entitled to seek [*72]  full recovery of their claims (rather than a portion of a 
settlement) and they would not be subject to Class Counsel's discretion in allocating settlement proceeds towards 
those claims. As noted, Class Counsel has discretion to take into account the percentage of recovery for categories 
of claims where the law is well-settled versus those where the merits are more iffy and attenuated.
Accordingly, the Special Master finds that Objecting Members' incorporated capacitor claims may proceed with 
these claims through the settlement allocation process.
D. Sufficiency of Objecting Members' Showing
15 To prevent prejudice to other Second Round claimants with significant incorporated capacitor claims, Objecting Members have 
proposed that the Court direct that the claim deadline for the Second Round be reopened and merged with the upcoming Third 
Round for the Nichicon and Rubycon settlements. MDL Dkt. No. 473 at 15 n. 14. They propose sending updated information to 
all Second and Third Round claimants advising them of the opportunity to include incorporated capacitor claims. Id. Because the 
Third Round claims are not before the Special Master and this is a matter of Court administration for the Court and the parties, 
the Special Master defers on this suggestion.
2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 232309, *69

 
Having determined that incorporated capacitor claims are encompassed in the settlement release, that — with one 
exception16 — the accuracy of Objecting Members' incorporated capacitor claims are not in dispute, that such 
claims are legally viable, and that they may be pursued through the settlement allocation process, issues 
nonetheless remain regarding Objecting Members' showing with respect to the appropriateness of a pro rata 
allocation of these claims from the settlement proceeds.
Under the stipulation, Class Counsel may have agreed to accept the extent of damages claimed (excluding the 
NCC/UCC claims), [*73]  but as Class Counsel noted at hearing, that does not equate to agreeing that the 
Objecting Members have made a sufficient showing that they would have a reasonable chance of prevailing on 
such a claim. In fact, Class Counsel argues that Objecting Members have as yet failed to provide essential 
information demonstrating at least one key element of their claim. Specifically, Class Counsel contends Objecting 
Members would need to establish that these Settling Defendants were actually aware that Objecting Members 
intended the capacitors they purchased through Aptiv's non-U.S. entities, Cisco's non-U.S. entities, or Jabril, 
Celestica, Foxconn, or Flextronics were for finished products to be delivered to the United States. Class Counsel 
also suggests that while the parties may have stipulated to the Objecting Members' calculation of the losses they 
sustained from over-priced capacitors, Class Counsel has not stipulated to the percentage of sales that Settling 
Defendants reasonably anticipated would go to the United States. This concern raises two separate issues — the 
applicable legal standard regarding Defendants' state of knowledge, and the quality of evidence required to 
establish what [*74]  the Defendants did or should have known about the percentage of sales that would be 
shipped to the United States.
The parties disagree about the law regarding an FTAIA defendant's state of mind Class Counsel argues that the 
evidence provided to it by Cisco does not demonstrate that anyone other than Cisco and Aptiv was aware of where 
these items would ultimately be delivered. Tr. at 67. Class Counsel states that ""the test of the FTAIA is whether it 
would be expected by that defendant that [the sale] would have an impact [in the U.S.]. I don't see anything in. . . 
the November 12, 2018 [declaration] that says why any defendant would have any expectation about anything. . . . 
There isn't anything that supports any intent of what the defendants would have been anticipating in terms of an 
impact in the U.S."" Tr. at 67. Although Objecting Members provided records of large volumes of incorporated 
capacitor products acquired by Cisco and Aptiv (or their agents) being shipped to the U.S., those records do not 
concern the state of knowledge of defendants at the time of sale. In response, Objecting Members' position at the 
hearing was simply, ""[T]here's no mens rea requirement under the FTAIA. [*75]  Full stop."" Tr. at 72.
On the issue of the relevant legal standard, the Special Master finds that Class Counsel is essentially correct. As 
the Court noted in the FTAIA II decision, ""the domestic effects exception states that conduct involving non-import 
trade or commerce with foreign nations is subject to the Sherman Act only if. . . the conduct had a 'direct, 
substantial and reasonably foreseeable effect' on U.S. domestic commerce. FTAIA II Order at 10 (quoting 15 
U.S.C. Sec. 6a(1) (2012)) (emphasis added).
The exact type of knowledge possessed by, or attributed to, a defendant required by the FTAIA is not well-settled 
(like many other aspects of the FTAIA). See, e.g., Comment, From Sea to Shining Sea: A New Approach to 
Interpreting the Foreign Trade Antitrust Improvements Act, 64 Emory L.J., 869, 897-905 (2015). The FTAIA was a 
legislative response designed largely to codify United States v. Aluminum Co. of America (Alcoa), 148 F.2d 416, 
444 (2d Cir. 1945). The U.S. Supreme Court in Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. California, 509 U.S. 764, 774-76, 113 S. Ct. 
2891, 125 L. Ed. 2d 612 (1993), appeared to adopt the intent standard established in Alcoa, that Sherman Act 
liability ""applies to foreign conduct that was meant to produce and did in fact produce some substantial effect in the 
United States."" Id. at 796. Other lower courts have subsequently adopted this standard as well. See, e.g., Carrier 
Corp. v. Outokumpu Oyj, 673 F.3d 430, 438 (6th Cir. 2012). Other courts however have applied an objective 
standard to the knowledge requirement in the FTAIA, observing that this element is satisfied [*76]  only if a direct 
and substantial effect on U.S. commerce would have been foreseeable to a reasonable person. In Animal Science 
Products, Inc. v. China Minmetals Corp., 654 F.3d 462, 471 (3rd Cir. 2011), the Third Circuit vacated and remanded 
a case that had dismissed an FTAIA action based on lack of evidence of defendants' intent, holding that the 
16 Namely, the dispute about duplicative claims for NCC and UCC is the exception.
2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 232309, *72

 
standard for ""reasonably foreseeable"" was ""whether the alleged domestic effect would have been evident to a 
reasonable person making practical business judgments.""
While the Court need not resolve this issue in the settlement context, it is clear that Objecting Members need to 
come forward with at least some showing in order to establish the scope of Settling Defendants' liability, and hence 
the reasonable value of their claims. Notably, in the Court's FTAIA II decision, the plaintiff Flextronics ""presented 
evidence that defendants sold capacitors to Flex Affiliates knowing that the capacitors would be incorporated into 
goods that were intended to be (and were) shipped to the U.S."" FTAIA II Order at 8 (quoting Dkt. No. 1722-3 at 20 
n.20).17 Accordingly, there is a mens rea requirement under the FTAIA in that, at the very least, it must be 
reasonably foreseeable to a defendant that its sale of goods at artificially inflated prices [*77]  will be shipped to the 
United States where it will have an effect on U.S. commerce.
Objecting Members may be able to make a fair argument based on existing evidence that — given the massive 
volume of capacitor purchases for eventual delivery into the United States presented here — it should have been 
reasonably foreseeable that some percentage of sales were destined to the U.S. At the hearing, Objecting 
Members argued that Cisco's business partners would certainly know what's in the public record about the 
percentage of Cisco's business that comes into the United States, and stated that — if necessary — Cisco could 
make a showing as strong as Flextronics did in the FTAIA II summary judgment proceeding. Tr. at 67-68.
In this respect, Objecting Members have an imperfect vehicle for resolving this dispute, but it is the vehicle they 
chose. While Objecting Members could likely establish that Settling Defendants knew that some percentage of 
capacitor sales to Cisco, Aptiv, Flextronics, Jabil, Celestica, and Foxconn were probably destined for the United 
States market, what percentage was reasonably foreseeable is likely harder to prove and is subject to an uncertain 
standard. [*78]  Objecting Members argue that Settling Defendants had constructive notice that establishes 
subjective intent because of various indicia that a product was intended for shipment to the U.S., including the 
voltage, certain NHTSA requirements, or the PPAP test. Tr. at 56-57. Even if this is so, Class Counsel generally 
should not be put to the burden of conducting a summary judgment-like proceeding. Here, Class Counsel would be 
required to consider Objecting Members' evidence of the state of mind of Defendants concerning the percentage of 
their sales that were likely to be shipped to the U.S., because that percentage bears upon the amount to which 
Objecting Members would ultimately be entitled.
The evidentiary challenge here is not insignificant. It is not in the record — let alone established — that all 
capacitors in products shipped to the U.S. are differentiated based on whether a product will be subject to NHTSA 
requirements, the PPAP test, U.S. voltage requirements, or some other unique signature feature. Moreover, past 
dealings may be relevant even under an objective standard. For example, if the percentage of purchases that went 
to the United States varied substantially from year [*79]  to year, the Settling Defendants may not be in a position to 
reasonably estimate the impact of their sales outside the United States that would ultimately have a direct effect on 
U.S. commerce. In short, that may not be reasonably foreseeable to a Settling Defendant such that Class Counsel 
would deem the claim viable.
Class Counsel has an obligation to the class not to simply accept a ballpark guess as to the actual dimensions of 
Objecting Members' adequately documented claims for incorporated capacitors. Although Class Counsel has 
stipulated to the accuracy of the numbers presented by Objecting Members for final sales of incorporated 
capacitors, it is also fair to acknowledge that this number has jumped around quite a bit during the course of these 
proceedings. As Class Counsel correctly recounted, Cisco's incorporated capacitor claims alone jumped from $81 
million in July 2017, to $429 million in October 2017, to $488 million in February 2018, to $493 million in April 2018, 
to $199 million in November 2018, to $142 million in March 2019. In fact, the Special Master notes that while 
Cisco's opening brief on its Motion originally sought $154,050,329.40 in supplemental commerce for 
17 The Hsiung case from the Ninth Circuit, on which the Court relies, cites with approval other cases noting that defendants' 
conduct must be ""directed at a U.S. import market,' even if the defendants did not engage in importation of products into the 
United States."" Hsiung, 778 F.3d at 755 n.8 (quoting Animal Sci. Prods., Inc. v. China Minmetals Corp., 654 F.3d 462, 471 & n. 
11 (3rd Cir. 2011)).
2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 232309, *76

 
incorporated [*80]  capacitors, it reduced that figure to $142,070,717.01 in its Reply Brief. MDL Dkt. No. 496 at 8 
n.3. This drop of over $12 million between February 8, 2019 and March 1, 2019 in the same pleading does not 
afford Class Counsel much confidence in the reliability of the figures regarding what Settling Defendants reasonably 
should or should not have known about the ultimate destination of various capacitor sales. Those numbers matter, 
however, because any overpayment to Objecting Members would come at the expense of compensating other DPP 
class members.
Based on these circumstances and the preceding rulings, the Special Master recommends that Objecting Members 
be allowed — within 20 days of any final order by the Court approving this Report — to present their best evidence 
to Class Counsel of the percentage of their respective incorporated capacitor claims that Settling Defendants either 
knew or should reasonably have foreseen being shipped to the United States. Class Counsel may then determine 
in the interest of the entire class whether the evidence is sufficient, which may include disallowing some percentage 
of that claim, or applying a uniform discount to this category of claims, or some [*81]  other method to account for 
the uncertain value of this category of claims relative to claims for unincorporated capacitors. If the Court 
determines that this is in the interest of judicial efficiency, any hearing on the reasonableness of this final figure 
would be subject to the Special Master's review.
Conclusion
The Objecting Members' incorporated capacitor claims are deemed to be subject to the Second Round settlement 
and release, and are viable, and compensable through the allocation process. The amount of those claims is 
subject to proof regarding the scope of such claims that were reasonably foreseeable to the Settling Defendants, 
and may be further discounted based on their relative viability and in the interest of fairness to the class as a whole. 
Issues of reopening any claims dates in this round is referred back to the Court. The Objecting Members should 
provide the further information required in the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law set forth above, including 
any adjustments based on the NCC/UCC dispute, to Class Counsel within 20 days of a Court order approving this 
Report. The Special Master is available to resolve any further disputes regarding that process if they [*82]  arise 
and at the discretion of the Court. Dated: 7/30/19
